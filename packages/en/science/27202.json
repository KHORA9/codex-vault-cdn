An accident might have snatched her away\r\nfrom him, and sent her spirit to join those of her father and mother,\r\nher sisters and her brothers, whom a terrible pestilence--_the Black\r\nDeath_--hurried to the tomb a few years before.\r\n\r\nNo: the old man could not believe that his darling granddaughter was no\r\nmore--for he had sought her throughout the neighboring district of the\r\nBlack Forest, and not a trace of her was to be seen. Had she fallen down\r\na precipice, or perished by the ruthless murderer's hand, he would have\r\ndiscovered her mangled corpse: had she become the prey of the ravenous\r\nwolves, certain signs of her fate would have doubtless somewhere\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nThe sad--the chilling conviction therefore, went to the old man's heart,\r\nthat the only being left to solace him on earth, had deserted him; and\r\nhis spirit was bowed down in despair.\r\n\r\nWho now would prepare his food, while he tended his little flock? who\r\nwas there to collect the dry branches in the forest, for the winter's\r\nfuel, while the aged shepherd watched a few sheep that he possessed? who\r\nwould now spin him warm clothing to protect his weak and trembling\r\nlimbs?\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Agnes,\" he murmured, in a tone indicative of a breaking heart, \"why\r\ncouldst thou have thus abandoned me? Didst thou quit the old man to\r\nfollow some youthful lover, who will buoy thee up with bright hopes, and\r\nthen deceive thee? O Agnes--my darling! hast thou left me to perish\r\nwithout a soul to close my eyes?\"\r\n\r\nIt was painful how that ancient shepherd wept.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud knock at the door of the cottage aroused him from his\r\npainful reverie; and he hastened, as fast as his trembling limbs would\r\npermit him, to answer the summons.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door; and a tall man, apparently about forty years of age,\r\nentered the humble dwelling. His light hair would have been magnificent\r\nindeed, were it not sorely neglected; his blue eyes were naturally fine\r\nand intelligent, but fearful now to meet, so wild and wandering were\r\ntheir glances: his form was tall and admirably symmetrical, but\r\nprematurely bowed by the weight of sorrow, and his attire was of costly\r\nmaterial, but indicative of inattention even more than it was\r\ntravel-soiled.\r\n\r\nThe old man closed the door, and courteously drew a stool near the fire\r\nfor the stranger who had sought in his cottage a refuge against the fury\r\nof the storm.\r\n\r\nHe also placed food before him; but the stranger touched it not--horror\r\nand dismay appearing to have taken possession of his soul.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the thunder which had hitherto growled at a distance, burst\r\nabove the humble abode; and the wind swept by with so violent a gust,\r\nthat it shook the little tenement to its foundation, and filled the\r\nneighboring forest with strange, unearthly noises.\r\n\r\nThen the countenance of the stranger expressed such ineffable horror,\r\namounting to a fearful agony, that the old man was alarmed, and\r\nstretched out his hand to grasp a crucifix that hung over the\r\nchimney-piece; but his mysterious guest made a forbidding sign of so\r\nmuch earnestness mingled with such proud authority, that the aged\r\nshepherd sank back into his seat without touching the sacred symbol.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the thunder past--the shrieking, whistling, gushing wind\r\nbecame temporarily lulled into low moans and subdued lamentations, amid\r\nthe mazes of the Black Forest; and the stranger grew more composed.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou tremble at the storm?\" inquired the old man.\r\n\r\n\"I am unhappy,\" was the evasive and somewhat impatient reply. \"Seek not\r\nto know more of me--beware how you question me. But you, old man, are\r\n_not_ happy! The traces of care seem to mingle with the wrinkles of age\r\nupon your brow!\"\r\n\r\nThe shepherd narrated, in brief and touching terms, the unaccountable\r\ndisappearance of his much-beloved granddaughter Agnes.\r\n\r\nThe stranger listened abstractedly at first; but afterward he appeared\r\nto reflect profoundly for several minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Your lot is wretched, old man,\" said he at length: \"if you live a few\r\nyears longer, that period must be passed in solitude and\r\ncheerlessness:--if you suddenly fall ill you must die the lingering\r\ndeath of famine, without a soul to place a morsel of food, or the\r\ncooling cup to your lips; and when you shall be no more, who will follow\r\nyou to the grave? There are no habitations nigh; the nearest village is\r\nhalf-a-day's journey distant; and ere the peasants of that hamlet, or\r\nsome passing traveler, might discover that the inmate of this hut had\r\nbreathed his last, the wolves from the forest would have entered and\r\nmangled your corpse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk not thus!\" cried the old man, with a visible shudder; then darting\r\na half-terrified, half-curious glance at his guest, he said, \"but who\r\nare you that speak in this awful strain--this warning voice?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the thunder rolled, with crashing sound, above the cottage; and\r\nonce more the wind swept by, laden, as it seemed, with the shrieks and\r\ngroans of human beings in the agonies of death.\r\n\r\nThe stranger maintained a certain degree of composure only by means of a\r\ndesperate effort, but he could not altogether subdue a wild flashing of\r\nthe eyes and a ghastly change of the countenance--signs of a profoundly\r\nfelt terror.\r\n\r\n\"Again I say, ask me not who I am!\" he exclaimed, when the thunder and\r\nthe gust had passed. \"My soul recoils from the bare idea of pronouncing\r\nmy own accursed name! But--unhappy as you see me--crushed, overwhelmed\r\nwith deep affliction as you behold me--anxious, but unable to repent for\r\nthe past as I am, and filled with appalling dread for the future as I\r\nnow proclaim myself to be, still is my power far, far beyond that limit\r\nwhich hems mortal energies within so small a sphere. Speak, old\r\nman--wouldst thou change thy condition? For to me--and to me alone of\r\nall human beings--belongs the means of giving thee new life--of\r\nbestowing upon thee the vigor of youth, of rendering that stooping form\r\nupright and strong, of restoring fire to those glazing eyes, and beauty\r\nto that wrinkled, sunken, withered countenance--of endowing thee, in a\r\nword, with a fresh tenure of existence and making that existence sweet\r\nby the aid of treasures so vast that no extravagance can dissipate\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nA strong though indefinite dread assailed the old man as this astounding\r\nproffer was rapidly opened, in all its alluring details, to his\r\nmind;--and various images of terror presented themselves to his\r\nimagination;--but these feelings were almost immediately dominated by a\r\nwild and ardent hope, which became the more attractive and exciting in\r\nproportion as a rapid glance at his helpless, wretched, deserted\r\ncondition led him to survey the contrast between what he then was, and\r\nwhat, if the stranger spoke truly, he might so soon become.\r\n\r\nThe stranger saw that he had made the desired impression; and he\r\ncontinued thus:\r\n\r\n\"Give but your assent, old man, and not only will I render thee young,\r\nhandsome, and wealthy; but I will endow thy mind with an intelligence to\r\nmatch that proud position. Thou shalt go forth into the world to enjoy\r\nall those pleasures, those delights, and those luxuries, the names of\r\nwhich are even now scarcely known to thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the price of this glorious boon?\" asked the old man,\r\ntrembling with mingled joy and terror through every limb.\r\n\r\n\"There are two conditions,\" answered the stranger, in a low, mysterious\r\ntone. \"The first is, that you become the companion of my wanderings for\r\none year and a half from the present time, until the hour of sunset, on\r\nthe 30th of July, 1517, when we must part forever, you to go\r\nwhithersoever your inclinations may guide you, and I---- But of _that_,\r\nno matter!\" he added, hastily, with a sudden motion as if of deep mental\r\nagony, and with wildly flashing eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old man shrank back in dismay from his mysterious guest: the thunder\r\nrolled again, the rude gust swept fiercely by, the dark forest rustled\r\nawfully, and the stranger's torturing feelings were evidently prolonged\r\nby the voices of the storm.\r\n\r\nA pause ensued; and the silence was at length broken by the old man, who\r\nsaid, in a hollow and tremulous tone, \"To the first condition I would\r\nwillingly accede. But the second?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you prey upon the human race, whom I hate; because of all the\r\nworld I alone am so deeply, so terribly accurst!\" was the ominously\r\nfearful yet only dimly significant reply.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head, scarcely comprehending the words of his\r\nguest, and yet daring not to ask to be more enlightened.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said the stranger, in a hasty but impressive voice: \"I require\r\na companion, one who has no human ties, and who still ministers to my\r\ncaprices,--who will devote himself wholly and solely to watch me in my\r\ndark hours, and endeavor to recall me back to enjoyment and pleasure,\r\nwho, when he shall be acquainted with my power, will devise new means in\r\nwhich to exercise it, for the purpose of conjuring up those scenes of\r\nenchantment and delight that may for a season win me away from thought.\r\nSuch a companion do I need for a period of one year and a half; and you\r\nare, of all men, the best suited to my design. But the Spirit whom I\r\nmust invoke to effect the promised change in thee, and by whose aid you\r\ncan be given back to youth and comeliness, will demand some fearful\r\nsacrifice at your hands. And the nature of that sacrifice--the nature of\r\nthe condition to be imposed--I can well divine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Name the sacrifice--name the condition!\" cried the old man, eagerly. \"I\r\nam so miserable--so spirit-broken--so totally without hope in this\r\nworld, that I greedily long to enter upon that new existence which you\r\npromised me! Say, then, what is the condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you prey upon the human race, whom _he_ hates as well as I,\"\r\nanswered the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Again these awful words!\" ejaculated the old man, casting trembling\r\nglances around him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--again those words,\" echoed the mysterious guest, looking with his\r\nfierce burning eyes into the glazed orbs of the aged shepherd. \"And now\r\nlearn their import!\" he continued, in a solemn tone. \"Knowest thou not\r\nthat there is a belief in many parts of our native land that at\r\nparticular seasons certain doomed men throw off the human shape and take\r\nthat of ravenous wolves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--yes--I have indeed heard of those strange legends in which the\r\nWehr-Wolf is represented in such appalling colors!\" exclaimed the old\r\nman, a terrible suspicion crossing his mind.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis said that at sunset on the last day of every month the mortal, to\r\nwhom belongs the destiny of the Wehr-Wolf, must exchange his natural\r\nform for that of the savage animal; in which horrible shape he must\r\nremain until the moment when the morrow's sun dawns upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The legend that told thee this spoke truly,\" said the stranger. \"And\r\nnow dost thou comprehend the condition which must be imposed upon thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do--I do!\" murmured the old man with a fearful shudder. \"But he who\r\naccepts that condition makes a compact with the evil one, and thereby\r\nendangers his immortal soul!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" was the reply. \"There is naught involved in this condition\r\nwhich---- But hesitate not,\" added the stranger, hastily: \"I have no\r\ntime to waste in bandying words. Consider all I offer you: in another\r\nhour you shall be another man!\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept the boon--and on the conditions stipulated!\" exclaimed the\r\nshepherd.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis well, Wagner----\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you know my name!\" cried the old man. \"And yet, meseems, I did\r\nnot mention it to thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Canst thou not already perceive that I am no common mortal?\" demanded\r\nthe stranger, bitterly. \"And who I am, and whence I derive my power, all\r\nshall be revealed to thee so soon as the bond is formed that must link\r\nus for eighteen months together! In the meantime, await me here!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the mysterious stranger quitted the cottage abruptly, and plunged\r\ninto the depths of the Black Forest.\r\n\r\nOne hour elapsed ere he returned--one mortal hour, during which Wagner\r\nsat bowed over his miserably scanty fire, dreaming of pleasure, youth,\r\nriches, and enjoyment; converting, in imagination, the myriad sparks\r\nwhich shone upon the extinguishing embers into piles of gold, and\r\nallowing his now uncurbed fancy to change the one single room of the\r\nwretched hovel into a splendid saloon, surrounded by resplendent mirrors\r\nand costly hangings, while the untasted fare for the stranger on the\r\nrude fir-table, became transformed, in his idea, into a magnificent\r\nbanquet laid out, on a board glittering with plate, lustrous with\r\ninnumerable lamps, and surrounded by an atmosphere fragrant with the\r\nmost exquisite perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe return of the stranger awoke the old man from his charming dream,\r\nduring which he had never once thought of the conditions whereby he was\r\nto purchase the complete realization of the vision.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what a glorious reverie you have dissipated!\" exclaimed Wagner.\r\n\"Fulfill but one tenth part of that delightful dream----\"\r\n\r\n\"I will fulfill it all!\" interrupted the stranger: then, producing a\r\nsmall vial from the bosom of his doublet, he said, \"Drink!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man seized the bottle, and speedily drained it to the dregs.\r\n\r\nHe immediately fell back upon the seat, in a state of complete lethargy.\r\n\r\nBut it lasted not for many minutes; and when he awoke again, he\r\nexperienced new and extraordinary sensations. His limbs were vigorous,\r\nhis form was upright as an arrow; his eyes, for many years dim and\r\nfailing, seemed gifted with the sight of an eagle, his head was warm\r\nwith a natural covering; not a wrinkle remained upon his brow nor on his\r\ncheeks; and, as he smiled with mingled wonderment and delight, the\r\nparting lips revealed a set of brilliant teeth. And it seemed, too, as\r\nif by one magic touch the long fading tree of his intellect had suddenly\r\nburst into full foliage, and every cell of his brain was instantaneously\r\nstored with an amount of knowledge, the accumulation of which stunned\r\nhim for an instant, and in the next appeared as familiar to him as if he\r\nhad never been without it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! great and powerful being, whomsoever thou art,\" exclaimed Wagner,\r\nin the full, melodious voice of a young man of twenty-one, \"how can I\r\nmanifest to thee my deep, my boundless gratitude for this boon which\r\nthou hast conferred upon me!\"\r\n\r\n\"By thinking no more of thy lost grand-child Agnes, but by preparing to\r\nfollow me whither I shall now lead thee,\" replied the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Command me: I am ready to obey in all things,\" cried Wagner. \"But one\r\nword ere we set forth--who art thou, wondrous man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth I have no secrets from thee, Wagner,\" was the answer, while\r\nthe stranger's eyes gleamed with unearthly luster; then, bending\r\nforward, he whispered a few words in the other's ear.\r\n\r\nWagner started with a cold and fearful shudder as if at some appalling\r\nannouncement; but he uttered not a word of reply--for his master\r\nbeckoned him imperiously away from the humble cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH-BED--THE OATH--THE LAST INJUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur tale commences in the middle of the month of November, 1520, and at\r\nthe hour of midnight.\r\n\r\nIn a magnificently furnished chamber, belonging to one of the largest\r\nmansions of Florence, a nobleman lay at the point of death.\r\n\r\nThe light of the lamp suspended to the ceiling played upon the ghastly\r\ncountenance of the dying man, the stern expression of whose features was\r\nnot even mitigated by the fears and uncertainties attendant on the hour\r\nof dissolution.\r\n\r\nHe was about forty-eight years of age, and had evidently been wondrously\r\nhandsome in his youth: for though the frightful pallor of death was\r\nalready upon his cheeks, and the fire of his large black eyes was dimmed\r\nwith the ravages of a long-endured disease, still the faultless outlines\r\nof the aquiline profile remained unimpaired.\r\n\r\nThe most superficial observer might have read the aristocratic pride of\r\nhis soul in the haughty curl of his short upper lip,--the harshness of\r\nhis domineering character in the lines that marked his forehead,--and\r\nthe cruel sternness of his disposition in the expression of his entire\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\nWithout absolutely scowling as he lay on that bed of death, his features\r\nwere characterized by an inexorable severity which seemed to denote the\r\npredominant influence of some intense passion--some evil sentiment\r\ndeeply rooted in his mind.\r\n\r\nTwo persons leant over the couch to which death was so rapidly\r\napproaching.\r\n\r\nOne was a lady of about twenty-five: the other was a youth of nineteen.\r\n\r\nThe former was eminently beautiful; but her countenance was marked with\r\nmuch of that severity--that determination--and even of that sternness,\r\nwhich characterized the dying nobleman. Indeed, a single glance was\r\nsufficient to show that they stood in the close relationship of father\r\nand daughter.\r\n\r\nHer long, black, glossy hair now hung disheveled over the shoulders that\r\nwere left partially bare by the hasty negligence with which she had\r\nthrown on a loose wrapper; and those shoulders were of the most dazzling\r\nwhiteness.\r\n\r\nThe wrapper was confined by a broad band at the waist; and the slight\r\ndrapery set off, rather than concealed, the rich contours of a form of\r\nmature but admirable symmetry.\r\n\r\nTall, graceful, and elegant, she united easy motion with fine\r\nproportion; thus possessing the lightness of the Sylph and the luxuriant\r\nfullness of the Hebe.\r\n\r\nHer countenance was alike expressive of intellectuality and strong\r\npassions. Her large black eyes were full of fire, and their glances\r\nseemed to penetrate the soul. Her nose, of the finest aquiline\r\ndevelopment,--her lips, narrow, but red and pouting, with the upper one\r\nshort and slightly projecting over the lower,--and her small, delicately\r\nrounded chin, indicated both decision and sensuality: but the insolent\r\ngaze of the libertine would have quailed beneath the look of sovereign\r\nhauteur which flashed from those brilliant eagle eyes.\r\n\r\nIn a word, she appeared to be a woman well adapted to command the\r\nadmiration--receive the homage--excite the passions--and yet repel the\r\ninsolence of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nBut those appearances were to some degree deceitful; for never was\r\nhomage offered to her--never was she courted nor flattered.\r\n\r\nTen years previously to the time of which we are writing--and when she\r\nwas only fifteen--the death of her mother, under strange and mysterious\r\ncircumstances, as it was generally reported, made such a terrible\r\nimpression on her mind, that she hovered for months on the verge of\r\ndissolution; and when the physician who attended upon her communicated\r\nto her father the fact that her life was at length beyond danger, that\r\nassurance was followed by the sad and startling declaration, that she\r\nhad forever lost the sense of hearing and the power of speech.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that homage was never paid nor adulation offered to\r\nNisida--the deaf and dumb daughter of the proud Count of Riverola!\r\n\r\nThose who were intimate with this family ere the occurrence of that sad\r\nevent--especially the physician, Dr. Duras, who had attended upon the\r\nmother in her last moments, and on the daughter during her\r\nillness--declared that, up to the period when the malady assailed her,\r\nNisida was a sweet, amiable and retiring girl; but she had evidently\r\nbeen fearfully changed by the terrible affliction which that malady had\r\nleft behind. For if she could no longer express herself in words, her\r\neyes darted lightnings upon the unhappy menials who had the misfortune\r\nto incur her displeasure; and her lips would quiver with the violence of\r\nconcentrated passion, at the most trifling neglect or error of which the\r\nfemale dependents immediately attached to her own person might happen to\r\nbe guilty.\r\n\r\nToward her father she often manifested a strange ebullition of\r\nanger--bordering even on inveterate spite, when he offended her: and\r\nyet, singular though it were, the count was devotedly attached to his\r\ndaughter. He frequently declared that, afflicted as she was, he was\r\nproud of her: for he was wont to behold in her flashing eyes--her\r\ncurling lip--and her haughty air, the reflection of his own proud--his\r\nown inexorable spirit.\r\n\r\nThe youth of nineteen to whom we have alluded was Nisida's brother; and\r\nmuch as the father appeared to dote upon the daughter, was the son\r\nproportionately disliked by that stern and despotic man.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this want of affection--or rather this complete aversion--on the\r\npart of the Count of Riverola toward the young Francisco, owed its\r\norigin to the total discrepancy of character existing between the father\r\nand son. Francisco was as amiable, generous-hearted, frank and agreeable\r\nas his sire was austere, stern, reserved and tyrannical. The youth was\r\nalso unlike his father in personal appearance, his hair being of a rich\r\nbrown, his eyes of a soft blue, and the general expression of his\r\ncountenance indicating the fairest and most endearing qualities which\r\ncan possibly characterize human nature.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, observe, before we pursue our narrative, that Nisida\r\nimitated not her father in her conduct toward Francisco; for she loved\r\nhim--she loved him with the most ardent affection--such an affection as\r\na sister seldom manifests toward a brother. It was rather the attachment\r\nof a mother for her child; inasmuch as Nisida studied all his\r\ncomforts--watched over him, as it were, with the tenderest\r\nsolicitude--was happy when he was present, melancholy when he was\r\nabsent, and seemed to be constantly racking her imagination to devise\r\nnew means to afford him pleasure.\r\n\r\nTo treat Francisco with the least neglect was to arouse the wrath of a\r\nfury in the breast of Nisida; and every unkind look which the count\r\ninflicted upon his son was sure, if perceived by his daughter, to evoke\r\nthe terrible lightnings of her brilliant eyes.\r\n\r\nSuch were the three persons whom we have thus minutely described to our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nThe count had been ill for some weeks at the time when this chapter\r\nopens; but on the night which marks that commencement, Dr. Duras had\r\ndeemed it his duty to warn the nobleman that he had not many hours to\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThe dying man had accordingly desired that his children might be\r\nsummoned; and when they entered the apartment, the physician and the\r\npriest were requested to withdraw.\r\n\r\nFrancisco now stood on one side of the bed, and Nisida on the other;\r\nwhile the count collected his remaining strength to address his last\r\ninjunctions to his son.\r\n\r\n\"Francisco,\" he said, in a cold tone, \"I have little inclination to\r\nspeak at any great length; but the words I am about to utter are\r\nsolemnly important. I believe you entertain the most sincere and earnest\r\nfaith in that symbol which now lies beneath your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The crucifix!\" ejaculated the young man. \"Oh, yes, my dear father!--it\r\nis the emblem of that faith which teaches us how to live and die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take it up--press it to your lips--and swear to obey the\r\ninstructions which I am about to give you,\" said the count.\r\n\r\nFrancisco did as he was desired; and, although tears were streaming from\r\nhis eyes, he exclaimed, in an emphatic manner, \"I swear most solemnly to\r\nfulfill your commands, my dear father, so confident am I that you will\r\nenjoin nothing that involves aught dishonorable!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare your qualifications,\" cried the count, sternly; \"and swear\r\nwithout reserve--or expect my dying curse, rather than my blessing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my dear father,\" ejaculated the youth, with intense anguish of\r\nsoul; \"talk not of so dreadful a thing as bequeathing me your dying\r\ncurse! I swear to fulfill your injunctions--without reserve.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he kissed the holy symbol.\r\n\r\n\"You act wisely,\" said the count, fixing his glaring eyes upon the\r\nhandsome countenance of the young man, who now awaited, in breathless\r\nsuspense, a communication thus solemnly prefaced. \"This key,\" continued\r\nthe nobleman, taking one from beneath his pillow as he spoke, \"belongs\r\nto the door in yonder corner of the apartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That door which is never opened!\" exclaimed Francisco, casting an\r\nanxious glance in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Who told you that the door was never opened,\" demanded the count,\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the servants remark----\" began the youth in a timid, but\r\nstill frank and candid manner.\r\n\r\n\"Then, when I am no more, see that you put an end to such impertinent\r\ngossiping,\" said the nobleman, impatiently; \"and you will be the better\r\nconvinced of the propriety of thus acting, as soon as you have learned\r\nthe nature of my injunctions. That door,\" he continued, \"communicates\r\nwith a small closet, which is accessible by no other means. Now my\r\nwish--my command is this:--Upon the day of your marriage, whenever such\r\nan event may occur--and I suppose you do not intend to remain unwedded\r\nall your life--I enjoin you to open the door of that closet. You must be\r\naccompanied by your bride--and by no other living soul. I also desire\r\nthat this may be done with the least possible delay--the very\r\nmorning--within the very hour after you quit the church. That closet\r\ncontains the means of elucidating a mystery profoundly connected with\r\nme--with you--with the family--a mystery, the developments of which may\r\nprove of incalculable service alike to yourself and to her who may share\r\nyour title and your wealth. But should you never marry, then must the\r\ncloset remain unvisited by _you_; nor need you trouble yourself\r\nconcerning the eventual discovery of the secret which it contains, by\r\nany person into whose hands the mansion may fall at your death. It is\r\nalso my wish that your sister should remain in complete ignorance of the\r\ninstructions which I am now giving you. Alas! poor girl--she cannot hear\r\nthe words which fall from my lips! neither shall you communicate their\r\nimport to her by writing, nor by the language of the fingers. And\r\nremember that while I bestow upon you my blessing--my dying\r\nblessing--may that blessing become a withering curse--the curse of hell\r\nupon you--if in any way you violate one tittle of the injunctions which\r\nI have now given you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dearest father,\" replied the weeping youth, who had listened with\r\nthe most profound attention, to these extraordinary commands; \"I would\r\nnot for worlds act contrary to your wishes. Singular as they appear to\r\nme, they shall be fulfilled to the very letter.\"\r\n\r\nHe received from his father's hand the mysterious key, which he had\r\nsecured about his person.\r\n\r\n\"You will find,\" resumed the count after a brief pause, \"that I have\r\nleft the whole of my property to you. At the same time my will specifies\r\ncertain conditions relative to your sister Nisida, for whom I have made\r\ndue provision only in the case--which is, alas! almost in defiance of\r\nevery hope!--of her recovery from that dreadful affliction which renders\r\nher so completely dependent upon your kindness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest father, you know how sincerely I am attached to my sister--how\r\ndevoted she is to me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough!\" cried the count; and overcome by the effort he had\r\nmade to deliver his last injunction, he fell back insensible on his\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nNisida, who had retained her face buried in her hands during the whole\r\ntime occupied in the above conversation, happened to look up at that\r\nmoment; and, perceiving the condition of her father, she made a hasty\r\nsign to Francisco to summon the physician and the priest from the room\r\nto which they had retired.\r\n\r\nThis commission was speedily executed, and in a few minutes the\r\nphysician and the priest were once more by the side of the dying noble.\r\n\r\nBut the instant that Dr. Duras--who was a venerable looking man of about\r\nsixty years of age--approached the bed, he darted, unseen by Francisco,\r\na glance of earnest inquiry toward Nisida, who responded by one of\r\nprofound meaning, shaking her head gently, but in a manner expressive of\r\ndeep melancholy, at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe physician appeared to be astonished at the negative thus conveyed by\r\nthe beautiful mute; and he even manifested a sign of angry impatience.\r\n\r\nBut Nisida threw upon him a look of so imploring a nature, that his\r\ntemporary vexation yielded to a feeling of immense commiseration for\r\nthat afflicted creature: and he gave her to understand, by another rapid\r\nglance, that her prayer was accorded.\r\n\r\nThis interchange of signs of such deep mystery scarcely occupied a\r\nmoment, and was altogether unobserved by Francisco.\r\n\r\nDr. Duras proceeded to administer restoratives to the dying\r\nnobleman--but in vain!\r\n\r\nThe count had fallen into a lethargic stupor, which lasted until four in\r\nthe morning, when his spirit passed gently away.\r\n\r\nThe moment Francisco and Nisida became aware that they were orphans,\r\nthey threw themselves into each other's arms, and renewed by that tender\r\nembrace the tacit compact of sincere affection which had ever existed\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nFrancisco's tears flowed freely; but Nisida did not weep!\r\n\r\nA strange--an almost portentous light shone in her brilliant black eyes;\r\nand though that wild gleaming denoted powerful emotions, yet it shed no\r\nluster upon the depths of her soul--afforded no clew to the real nature\r\nof these agitated feelings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly withdrawing himself from his sister's arms, Francisco conveyed\r\nto her by the language of the fingers the following tender\r\nsentiment:--\"You have lost a father, beloved Nisida, but you have a\r\ndevoted and affectionate brother left to you!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nisida replied through the same medium, \"Your happiness, dearest\r\nbrother, has ever been my only study, and shall continue so.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician and Father Marco, the priest, now advanced, and taking the\r\nbrother and sister by the hands, led them from the chamber of death.\r\n\r\n\"Kind friends,\" said Francisco, now Count of Riverola, \"I understand\r\nyou. You would withdraw my sister and myself from a scene too mournful\r\nto contemplate. Alas! it is hard to lose a father; but especially so at\r\nmy age, inexperienced as I am in the ways of the world!\"\r\n\r\n\"The world is indeed made up of thorny paths and devious ways, my dear\r\nyoung friend,\" returned the physician; \"but a stout heart and integrity\r\nof purpose will ever be found faithful guides. The more exalted and the\r\nwealthier the individual, the greater the temptations he will have to\r\nencounter. Reflect upon this, Francisco: it is advice which I, as an\r\nold--indeed, the oldest friend of your family--take the liberty to\r\noffer.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, the venerable physician wrung the hands of the brother\r\nand sister, and hurried from the house, followed by the priest.\r\n\r\nThe orphans embraced each other, and retired to their respective\r\napartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nNISIDA--THE MYSTERIOUS CLOSET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room to which Nisida withdrew, between four and five o'clock on that\r\nmournful winter's morning, was one of a suit entirely appropriated to\r\nher own use.\r\n\r\nThis suit consisted of three apartments, communicating with each other,\r\nand all furnished in the elegant and tasteful manner of that age.\r\n\r\nThe innermost of the three rooms was used as her bed-chamber, and when\r\nshe now entered it, a young girl of seventeen, beautiful as an angel,\r\nbut dressed in the attire of a dependent, instantly arose from a seat\r\nnear the fire that blazed on the hearth, and cast a respectful but\r\ninquiring glance toward her mistress.\r\n\r\nNisida gave her to understand, by a sign, that all was over.\r\n\r\nThe girl started, as if surprised that her lady indicated so little\r\ngrief; but the latter motioned her, with an impatient gesture, to leave\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nWhen Flora--such was the name of the dependent--had retired Nisida threw\r\nherself into a large arm-chair near the fire, and immediately became\r\nburied in a deep reverie. With her splendid hair flowing upon her white\r\nshoulders--her proud forehead supported on her delicate hand--her lips\r\napart, and revealing the pearly teeth--her lids with their long black\r\nfringes half-closed over the brilliant eyes--and her fine form cast in\r\nvoluptuous abandonment upon the soft cushions of the chair--she indeed\r\nseemed a magnificent creature!\r\n\r\nBut when, suddenly awaking from that profound meditation, she started\r\nfrom her seat with flashing eyes--heaving bosom--and an expression of\r\ncountenance denoting a fixed determination to accomplish some deed from\r\nwhich her better feelings vainly bade her to abstain:--when she drew her\r\ntall--her even majestic form up to its full height, the drapery\r\nshadowing forth every contour of undulating bust and exquisitely modeled\r\nlimb--while her haughty lip curled in contempt of any consideration save\r\nher own indomitable will--she appeared rather a heroine capable of\r\nleading an Amazonian army, than a woman to whom the sighing swain might\r\nventure to offer up the incense of love.\r\n\r\nThere was something awful in the aspect of this mysterious\r\nbeing--something ineffably grand and imposing in her demeanor--as she\r\nthus suddenly rose from her almost recumbent posture, and burst into the\r\nattitude of a resolute and energetic woman.\r\n\r\nDrawing the wrapper around her form, she lighted a lamp, and was about\r\nto quit the chamber, when her eyes suddenly encountered the mild and\r\nbenignant glance which the portrait of a lady appeared to cast upon her.\r\n\r\nThis portrait, which hung against the wall precisely opposite to the\r\nbed, represented a woman of about thirty years of age--a woman of a\r\nbeauty much in the same style as that of Nisida, but not marred by\r\nanything approaching to a sternness of expression. On the contrary, if\r\nan angel had looked through those mild black eyes, their glances could\r\nnot have been endowed with a holier kindness; the smiles of good spirits\r\ncould not be more plaintively sweet than those which the artist had made\r\nto play upon the lips of that portrait.\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of this discrepancy between the expression of Nisida's\r\ncountenance and that of the lady who had formed the subject of the\r\npicture, it was not difficult to perceive a certain physical likeness\r\nbetween the two; nor will the reader be surprised when we state that\r\nNisida was gazing on the portrait of her deceased mother.\r\n\r\nAnd that gaze--oh! how intent, how earnest, how enthusiastic it was! It\r\nmanifested something more than love--something more impassioned and\r\nardent than the affection which a daughter might exhibit toward even a\r\nliving mother; it showed a complete devotion--an adoration--a worship!\r\n\r\nLong and fixedly did Nisida gaze upon that portrait; till suddenly from\r\nher eyes, which shot forth such burning glances, gushed a torrent of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThen--probably fearful lest this weakness on her part might impair the\r\nresolution necessary to execute the purpose which she had in\r\nview--Nisida dashed away the tears from her long lashes, hastily quitted\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHaving traversed the other two apartments of her own suit, she cast a\r\nsearching glance along the passage which she now entered; and, satisfied\r\nthat none of the domestics were about, for it was not yet six o'clock on\r\nthat winter's morning, she hastened to the end of the corridor.\r\n\r\nThe lamp flared with the speed at which she walked; and its uncertain\r\nlight enhanced the pallor that now covered her countenance.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the passage she cautiously opened the door, and entered\r\nthe room with which it communicated.\r\n\r\nThis was the sleeping apartment of her brother.\r\n\r\nA single glance convinced her that he was wrapt in the arms of slumber.\r\n\r\nHe slept soundly too--for he was wearied with the vigil which he had\r\npassed by the death-bed of his father--worn out also by the thousand\r\nconflicting and unsatisfactory conjectures that the last instructions of\r\nhis parent had naturally excited in his mind.\r\n\r\nHe had not, however, been asleep a quarter of an hour when Nisida stole,\r\nin the manner described, into his chamber.\r\n\r\nA smile of mingled joy and triumph animated her countenance, and a\r\ncarnation tinge flushed her cheeks when she found he was fast locked in\r\nthe embrace of slumber.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, she examined his doublet, and clutched\r\nthe key that his father had given to him scarcely six hours before.\r\n\r\nThen, light as the fawn, she left the room.\r\n\r\nHaving retraced her steps half-way up the passage, she paused at the\r\ndoor of the chamber in which the corpse of her father lay.\r\n\r\nFor an instant--a single instant--she seemed to revolt from the\r\nprosecution of her design, then, with a stern contraction of the brows,\r\nand an imperious curl of the lip--as if she said within herself, \"_Fool\r\nthat I am to hesitate!_\"--she entered the room.\r\n\r\nWithout fear--without compunction, she approached the bed. The body was\r\nlaid out: stretched in its winding sheet, stiff and stark did it seem to\r\nrepose on the mattress--the countenance rendered more ghastly than even\r\ndeath could make it, by the white band which tied up the under jaw.\r\n\r\nThe nurse who had thus disposed the corpse, had retired to snatch a few\r\nhours of rest; and there was consequently no spy upon Nisida's actions.\r\n\r\nWith a fearless step she advanced toward the closet--the mysterious\r\ncloset relative to which such strange injunctions had been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUSCRIPT--FLORA FRANCATELLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNisida's hand trembled not as she placed the key in the lock; but when\r\nit turned, and she knew that in another instant she might open that door\r\nif she chose, she compressed her lips firmly together--she called all\r\nher courage to her aid--for she seemed to imagine that it was necessary\r\nto prepare herself to behold something frightfully appalling.\r\n\r\nAnd now again her cheeks were deadly pale; but the light that burned in\r\nher eyes was brilliant in the extreme.\r\n\r\nWhite as was her countenance, her large black orbs appeared to shine--to\r\nglow--to burn, as if with a violent fever.\r\n\r\nAdvancing with her left hand, she half-opened the door of the closet\r\nwith her right.\r\n\r\nThen she plunged her glances with rapidity into the recess.\r\n\r\nBut, holy God! what a start that courageous, bold, and energetic woman\r\ngave--a start as if the cold hand of a corpse had been suddenly thrust\r\nforth to grasp her.\r\n\r\nAnd oh! what horror convulsed her countenance--while her lips were\r\ncompressed as tightly as if they were an iron vise.\r\n\r\nRapidly and instantly recoiling as that glance was, it had nevertheless\r\nrevealed to her an object of interest as well as of horror; for with\r\neyes now averted, she seized something within the closet, and thrust it\r\ninto her bosom.\r\n\r\nThen, hastily closing the door, she retraced her way to her brother's\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nHe still slept soundly; Nisida returned the key to the pocket whence she\r\nhad taken it, and hurried back to her own room, from which she had\r\nscarcely been absent five minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd did she seek her couch? did she repair to rest?\r\n\r\nNo; that energetic woman experienced no weariness--yielded to no\r\nlassitude.\r\n\r\nCarefully bolting the door of her innermost chamber, she seated herself\r\nin the arm-chair and drew from her bosom the object which she had taken\r\nfrom the mysterious closet.\r\n\r\nIt was a manuscript, consisting of several small slips of paper,\r\nsomewhat closely written upon.\r\n\r\nThe paper was doubtless familiar to her; for she paused not to consider\r\nits nature, but greedily addressed herself to the study of the meaning\r\nwhich it conveyed. And of terrible import seemed that manuscript to be;\r\nfor while Nisida read, her countenance underwent many and awful\r\nchanges--and her bosom heaved convulsively at one instant, while at\r\nanother it remained motionless, as if respiration were suspended.\r\n\r\nAt length the perusal was completed; and grinding her teeth with\r\ndemoniac rage, she threw the manuscript upon the floor. But at the same\r\nmoment her eyes, which she cast wildly about her, caught the mild and\r\nbenign countenance of her mother's portrait; and, as oil stills the fury\r\nof the boiling billows, did the influence of that picture calm in an\r\ninstant the tremendous emotions of Nisida's soul.\r\n\r\nTears burst from her eyes, and she suddenly relapsed from the incarnate\r\nfiend into the subdued woman.\r\n\r\nThen stooping down, she picked up the papers that lay scattered on the\r\nfloor: but as she did so she averted her looks, with loathing and\r\ndisgust, as much as possible from the pages that her hands collected\r\nalmost at random.\r\n\r\nAnd now another idea struck her--an idea the propriety of which\r\nevidently warred against her inclination.\r\n\r\nShe was not a woman of mere impulses--although she often acted speedily\r\nafter a thought had entered her brain. But she was wondrously quick at\r\nweighing all reasons for or against the suggestions of her imagination;\r\nand thus, to any one who was not acquainted with her character, she\r\nmight frequently appear to obey the first dictates of her impetuous\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nScarcely three minutes after the new idea had struck her, her resolution\r\nwas fixed.\r\n\r\nOnce more concealing the papers in her bosom, she repaired with the lamp\r\nto her brother's room--purloined the key a second time--hastened to the\r\nchamber of death--opened the closet again--and again sustained the shock\r\nof a single glance at its horrors, as she returned the manuscript to the\r\nplace whence she had originally taken it.\r\n\r\nThen, having once more retraced her way to Francisco's chamber, she\r\nrestored the key to the folds of his doublet--for he continued to sleep\r\nsoundly; and Nisida succeeded in regaining her own apartments just in\r\ntime to avoid the observation of the domestics, who were now beginning\r\nto move about.\r\n\r\nNisida sought her couch and slept until nearly ten o'clock, when she\r\nawoke with a start--doubtless caused by some unpleasant dream.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the hour by reference to a water-clock, or clepsydra,\r\nwhich stood on a marble pedestal near the head of the bed, she\r\narose--unlocked the door of her apartment--rang a silver bell--and then\r\nreturned to her bed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Flora, who had been waiting in the adjoining room,\r\nentered the chamber.\r\n\r\nNisida, on regaining her couch, had turned her face toward the wall, and\r\nwas therefore unable to perceive anything that took place in the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nThe mere mention of such a circumstance would be trivial in the extreme,\r\nwere it not necessary to record it in consequence of an event which now\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nFor, as Flora advanced into the room, her eyes fell on a written paper\r\nthat lay immediately beneath the arm-chair; and conceiving from its\r\nappearance that it had not been thrown down on purpose, as it was in\r\nnowise crushed nor torn, she mechanically picked it up and placed it on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nShe then proceeded to arrange the toilet table of her mistress,\r\npreparatory to that lady's rising; and while she is thus employed, we\r\nwill endeavor to make our readers a little better acquainted with her\r\nthan they can possibly yet be.\r\n\r\nFlora Francatelli was the orphan daughter of parents who had suddenly\r\nbeen reduced from a state of affluence to a condition of extreme\r\npoverty. Signor Francatelli could not survive this blow: he died of a\r\nbroken heart; and his wife shortly afterward followed him to the\r\ntomb--also the victim of grief. They left two children behind them:\r\nFlora, who was then an infant, and a little boy, named Alessandro, who\r\nwas five years old. The orphans were entirely dependent upon the\r\nkindness of a maiden aunt--their departed father's sister. This\r\nrelative, whose name was, of course, also Francatelli, performed a\r\nmother's part toward the children: and deprived herself, not only of\r\ncomforts, but at times even of necessaries, in order that they should\r\nnot want. Father Marco, a priest belonging to one of the numerous\r\nmonasteries of Florence, and who was a worthy man, took compassion upon\r\nthis little family; and not only devoted his attention to teach the\r\norphans to read and write--great accomplishments among the middle\r\nclasses in those days--but also procured from a fund at the disposal of\r\nhis abbot, certain pecuniary assistance for the aunt.\r\n\r\nThe care which this good relative took of the orphans, and the kindness\r\nof Father Marco, were well rewarded by the veneration and attachment\r\nwhich Alessandro and Flora manifested toward them. When Alessandro had\r\nnumbered eighteen summers, he was fortunate enough to procure, through\r\nthe interest of Father Marco, the situation of secretary to a Florentine\r\nnoble, who was charged with a diplomatic mission to the Ottoman Porte;\r\nand the young man proceeded to Leghorn, whence he embarked for\r\nConstantinople, attended by the prayers, blessings, and hopes of the\r\naunt and sister, and of the good priest, whom he left behind.\r\n\r\nTwo years after his departure, Father Marco obtained for Flora a\r\nsituation about the person of the Lady Nisida; for the monk was\r\nconfessor to the family of Riverola, and his influence was sufficient to\r\nsecure that place for the young maiden.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Flora was sweetly beautiful. Her large blue\r\neyes were fringed with dark lashes, which gave them an expression of the\r\nmost melting softness; her dark brown hair, arranged in the modest\r\nbands, seemed of even a darker hue when contrasted with the brilliant\r\nand transparent clearness of her complexion, and though her forehead was\r\nwhite and polished as alabaster, yet the rose-tint of health was upon\r\nher cheeks, and her lips had the rich redness of coral. Her nose was\r\nperfectly straight; her teeth were white and even, and the graceful\r\narching of her swan-neck imparted something of nobility to her tall,\r\nsylph-like, and exquisitely proportioned figure.\r\n\r\nRetiring and bashful in her manners, every look which fell from her\r\neyes--every smile which wreathed her lips, denoted the chaste purity of\r\nher soul. With all her readiness to oblige--with all her anxiety to do\r\nher duty as she ought, she frequently incurred the anger of the\r\nirascible Nisida; but Flora supported those manifestations of wrath with\r\nthe sweetest resignation, because the excellence of her disposition\r\ntaught her to make every allowance for one so deeply afflicted as her\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nSuch was the young maiden whom the nature of the present tale compels us\r\nthus particularly to introduce to our readers.\r\n\r\nHaving carefully arranged the boudoir, so that its strict neatness might\r\nbe welcome to her mistress when that lady chose to rise from her couch,\r\nFlora seated herself near the table, and gave way to her reflections.\r\n\r\nShe thought of her aunt, who inhabited a neat little cottage on the\r\nbanks of the Arno, and whom she was usually permitted to visit every\r\nSabbath afternoon--she thought of her absent brother, who was still in\r\nthe service of the Florentine Envoy to the Ottomon Porte, where that\r\ndiplomatist was detained by the tardiness that marked the negotiations\r\nwith which he was charged; and then she thought--thought too, with an\r\ninvoluntary sigh--of Francisco, Count of Riverola.\r\n\r\nShe perceived that she had sighed--and, without knowing precisely\r\nwherefore, she was angry with herself.\r\n\r\nAnxious to turn the channel of her meditations in another direction, she\r\nrose from her seat to examine the clepsydra. That movement caused her\r\neyes to fall upon the paper which she had picked up a quarter of an hour\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself the image of Francisco was still uppermost in her\r\nthoughts; and, in the contemplative vein thus encouraged, her eyes\r\nlingered, unwittingly--and through no base motive of curiosity--upon the\r\nwriting which that paper contained.\r\n\r\nThus she actually found herself reading the first four lines of the\r\nwriting, before she recollected what she was doing.\r\n\r\nThe act was a purely mechanical one, which not the most rigid moralist\r\ncould blame.\r\n\r\nAnd had the contents of the paper been of no interest, she might even\r\nhave continued to read more in that same abstracted mood; but those four\r\nfirst lines were of a nature which sent a thrilling sensation of horror\r\nthrough her entire frame; the feeling terminating with an icy coldness\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\nShe shuddered without starting--shuddered as she stood; and not even a\r\nmurmur escaped her lips.\r\n\r\nThe intenseness of that sudden pang of horror deprived her alike of\r\nspeech and motion during the instant that it lasted.\r\n\r\nAnd those lines, which produced so strange an impression upon the young\r\nmaiden, ran thus:\r\n\r\n    \"merciless scalpel hacked and hewed away at the still almost\r\n    palpitating flesh of the murdered man, in whose breast the\r\n    dagger remained buried--a ferocious joy--a savage hyena-like\r\n    triumph----\"\r\n\r\nFlora read no more; she could not--even if she had wished.\r\n\r\nFor a minute she remained rooted to the spot; then she threw herself\r\ninto the chair, bewildered and dismayed at the terrible words which had\r\nmet her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe thought that the handwriting was not unknown to her; but she could\r\nnot recollect whose it was. One fact was, however, certain--it was not\r\nthe writing of her mistress.\r\n\r\nShe was musing upon the horrible and mysterious contents of the paper,\r\nwhen Nisida rose from her couch.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging with a slight nod of the head the respectful salutation of\r\nher attendant, she hastily slipped on a loose wrapper, and seated\r\nherself in the arm-chair which Flora had just abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe young girl then proceeded to comb out the long raven hair of her\r\nmistress.\r\n\r\nBut this occupation was most rudely interrupted: for Nisida's eyes\r\nsuddenly fell upon the manuscript page on the table; and she started up\r\nin a paroxysm of mingled rage and alarm.\r\n\r\nHaving assured herself by a second glance that it was indeed a portion\r\nof the writings which had produced so strange an effect upon her a few\r\nhours previously, she turned abruptly toward Flora; and, imperiously\r\nconfronting the young maiden, pointed to the paper in a significant\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFlora immediately indicated by a sign that she had found it on the\r\nfloor, beneath the arm-chair.\r\n\r\n\"And you have read it!\" was the accusation which, with wonderful\r\nrapidity, Nisida conveyed by means of her fingers--fixing her piercing,\r\npenetrating eyes on Flora's countenance at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe young maiden scorned the idea of a falsehood; although she perceived\r\nthat her reply would prove far from agreeable to her mistress, she\r\nunhesitatingly admitted, by the language of the hands. \"I read the first\r\nfour lines, and no more.\"\r\n\r\nA crimson glow instantly suffused the face, neck, shoulders, and bosom\r\nof Nisida; but instantly compressing her lips--as was her wont when\r\nunder the influence of her boiling passions, she turned her flashing\r\neyes once more upon the paper, to ascertain which leaf of the manuscript\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nThat rapid glance revealed to her the import, the dread, but profoundly\r\nmysterious import of the four first lines on that page; and, again\r\ndarting her soul-searching looks upon the trembling Flora, she demanded,\r\nby the rapid play of her delicate taper fingers \"Will you swear that you\r\nread no more?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I hope for salvation!\" was Flora's symbolic answer.\r\n\r\nThe penetrating, imperious glance of Nisida dwelt long upon the maiden's\r\ncountenance; but no sinister expression--no suspicious change on that\r\nfair and candid face contradicted the assertion which she had made.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you; but beware how you breathe to a living soul a word of\r\nwhat you did read!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the injunction which Nisida now conveyed by her usual means of\r\ncommunication; and Flora signified implicit obedience.\r\n\r\nNisida then secured the page of writing in her jewel casket; and the\r\ndetails of the toilet were resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE FUNERAL--THE INTERRUPTION OF THE CEREMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight days after the death of the Count of Riverola, the funeral took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe obsequies were celebrated at night, with all the pomp observed\r\namongst noble families on such occasions. The church in which the corpse\r\nwas buried, was hung with black cloth; and even the innumerable wax\r\ntapers which burned upon the altar and around the coffin failed to\r\ndiminish the lugubrious aspect of the scene.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the bier stood the youthful heir of Riverola; his pale\r\ncountenance of even feminine beauty contrasting strangely with the\r\nmourning garments which he wore, and his eyes bent upon the dark chasm\r\nthat formed the family vault into which the remains of his sire were\r\nabout to be lowered.\r\n\r\nAround the coffin stood Dr. Duras and other male friends of the\r\ndeceased: for the females of the family were not permitted, by the\r\ncustom of the age and the religion, to be present on occasions of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIt was eleven o'clock at night: and the weather without was stormy and\r\ntempestuous.\r\n\r\nThe wind moaned through the long aisles, raising strange and ominous\r\nechoes, and making the vast folds of sable drapery wave slowly backward\r\nand forward, as if agitated by unseen hands. A few spectators, standing\r\nin the background, appeared like grim figures on a black tapestry; and\r\nthe gleam of the wax tapers, oscillating on their countenances, made\r\nthem seem death-like and ghastly.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the shrill wail of the shriek-owl, and the flapping of\r\nits wings against the diamond-paned windows of the church, added to the\r\nawful gloom of the funeral scene.\r\n\r\nAnd now suddenly arose the chant of the priests--the parting hymn for\r\nthe dead!\r\n\r\nFrancisco wept, for though his father had never manifested toward him an\r\naffection of the slightest endearing nature, yet the disposition of the\r\nyoung count was excellent; and, when he gazed upon the coffin, he\r\nremembered not the coldness with which its inmate in his lifetime had\r\ntreated him--he thought only of a parent whom he had lost, and whose\r\nremains were there!\r\n\r\nAnd truly, on the brink of the tomb no animosity should ever find a\r\nresting-place in the human heart. Though elsewhere men yield to the\r\ninfluence of their passions and their feelings, in pursuing each his\r\nseparate interests--though, in the great world, we push and jostle each\r\nother, as if the earth were not large enough to allow us to follow our\r\nseparate ways--yet, when we meet around the grave, to consign a fellow\r\ncreature to his last resting-place, let peace and holy forgiveness\r\noccupy our souls. There let the clash of interests and the war of\r\njealousies be forgotten; and let us endeavor to persuade ourselves that,\r\nas all the conflicting pursuits of life must terminate at this point at\r\nlast, so should our feelings converge to the one focus of amenity and\r\nChristian love. And, after all, how many who have considered themselves\r\nto be antagonists must, during a moment of solemn reflection, become\r\nconvinced that, when toiling in the great workshop of the world, they\r\nhave been engaged, in unconscious fraternity, in building up the same\r\nfabric!\r\n\r\nThe priests were in the midst of their solemn chant--a deathlike silence\r\nand complete immovability prevailed among the mourners and the\r\nspectators--and the wind was moaning beneath the vaulted roofs, awaking\r\nthose strange and tomb-like sounds which are only heard in large\r\nchurches,--when light but rushing footsteps were heard on the marble\r\npavement; and in another minute a female, not clothed in a mourning\r\ngarb, but splendidly as for a festival, precipitated herself toward the\r\nbier.\r\n\r\nThere her strength suddenly seemed to be exhausted; and, with a piercing\r\nscream, she sank senseless on the cold stones.\r\n\r\nThe chant of the priest was immediately stilled; and Francisco hurrying\r\nforward, raised the female in his arms, while Dr. Duras asked for water\r\nto sprinkle on her countenance.\r\n\r\nOver her head the stranger wore a white veil of rich material, which was\r\nfastened above her brow by a single diamond of unusual size and\r\nbrilliant luster. When the veil was drawn aside, shining auburn tresses\r\nwere seen depending in wanton luxuriance over shoulders of alabaster\r\nwhiteness: a beautiful but deadly pale countenance was revealed; and a\r\nsplendid purple velvet dress delineated the soft and flowing outlines of\r\na form modeled to the most perfect symmetry.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be about twenty years of age,--in the full splendor of\r\nloveliness, and endowed with charms which presented to the gaze of those\r\naround a very incarnation of the ideal beauty which forms the theme of\r\nraptured poets.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as the vacillating and uncertain light of the wax-candles\r\nbeamed upon her, as she lay senseless in the arms of the Count Riverola,\r\nher pale, placid face appeared that of a classic marble statue; but\r\nnothing could surpass the splendid effects which the funeral tapers\r\nproduced on the rich redundancy of her hair, which seemed dark where the\r\nshadows rested on it, but glittering as with a bright glory where the\r\nluster played on its shining masses.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the solemnity of the place and the occasion, the mourners\r\nwere struck by the dazzling beauty of that young female, who had thus\r\nappeared so strangely amongst them; but respect still retained at a\r\ndistance those persons who were merely present from curiosity to witness\r\nthe obsequies of one of the proudest nobles of Florence.\r\n\r\nAt length the lady opened her large hazel eyes, and glanced wildly\r\naround, a quick spasm passing like an electric shock over her frame at\r\nthe same instant; for the funeral scene burst upon her view, and\r\nreminded her where she was, and why she was there.\r\n\r\nRecovering herself almost as rapidly as she had succumbed beneath\r\nphysical and mental exhaustion, she started from Francisco's arms; and\r\nturning upon him a beseeching, inquiring glance, exclaimed in a voice\r\nwhich ineffable anguish could not rob of its melody: \"Is it true--oh,\r\ntell me is it true that the Count Riverola is no more?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, alas! too true, lady,\" answered Francisco, in a tone of the\r\ndeepest melancholy.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the fair stranger rebounded at the words which thus seemed\r\nto destroy a last hope that lingered in her soul; and a hysterical\r\nshriek burst from her lips as she threw her snow-white arms, bare to the\r\nshoulders, around the head of the pall-covered coffin.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my much-loved--my noble Andrea!\" she exclaimed, a torrent of tears\r\nnow gushing from her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That voice!--is it possible?\" cried one of the spectators who had been\r\nhitherto standing, as before said, at a respectful distance: and the\r\nspeaker--a man of tall, commanding form, graceful demeanor, wondrously\r\nhandsome countenance, and rich attire--immediately hurried toward the\r\nspot where the young female still clung to the coffin, no one having the\r\nheart to remove her.\r\n\r\nThe individual who had thus stepped forward, gave one rapid but\r\nsearching glance at the lady's countenance; and, yielding to the\r\nsurprise and joy which suddenly animated him, he exclaimed: \"Yes--it is,\r\nindeed, the lost Agnes!\"\r\n\r\nThe young female started when she heard her name thus pronounced in a\r\nplace where she believed herself to be entirely unknown; and\r\nastonishment for an instant triumphed over the anguish of her heart.\r\n\r\nHastily withdrawing her snow-white arms from the head of the coffin, she\r\nturned toward the individual who had uttered her name, and he instantly\r\nclasped her in his arms, murmuring, \"Dearest--dearest Agnes, art thou\r\nrestored----\"\r\n\r\nBut the lady shrieked, and struggled to escape from that tender embrace,\r\nexclaiming, \"What means this insolence? will no one protect me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will I,\" said Francisco, darting forward, and tearing her away\r\nfrom the stranger's arms. \"But, in the name of Heaven! let this\r\nmisunderstanding be cleared up elsewhere. Lady--and you, signor--I call\r\non you to remember where you are, and how solemn a ceremony you have\r\nboth aided to interrupt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not that man!\" ejaculated Agnes, indicating the stranger. \"I\r\ncome hither, because I heard--but an hour ago--that my noble Andrea was\r\nno more. And I would not believe those who told me. Oh! no--I could not\r\nthink that Heaven had thus deprived me of all I loved on earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady, you are speaking of my father,\" said Francisco, in a somewhat\r\nsevere tone.\r\n\r\n\"Your father!\" cried Agnes, now surveying the young count with interest\r\nand curiosity. \"Oh! then, my lord, you can pity--you can feel for me,\r\nwho in losing your father have lost all that could render existence\r\nsweet!\"\r\n\r\n\"No--you have not lost all!\" exclaimed the handsome stranger, advancing\r\ntoward Agnes, and speaking in a profoundly impressive tone. \"Have you\r\nnot one single relative left in the world? Consider, lady--an old, old\r\nman--a shepherd in the Black Forest of Germany----\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak not of him!\" cried Agnes, wildly. \"Did he know all, he would\r\ncurse me--he would spurn me from him--he would discard me forever! Oh!\r\nwhen I think of that poor old man, with his venerable white hair,--that\r\naged, helpless man, who was so kind to me, who loved me so well, and\r\nwhom I so cruelly abandoned. But tell me, signor,\" she exclaimed, in\r\nsuddenly altered tone, while her breath came with the difficulty of\r\nacute suspense,--\"tell me, signor, does that old man still live?\"\r\n\r\n\"He lives, Agnes,\" was the reply. \"I know him well; at this moment he is\r\nin Florence!\"\r\n\r\n\"In Florence!\" repeated Agnes; and so unexpectedly came this\r\nannouncement, that her limbs seemed to give way under her, and she would\r\nhave fallen on the marble pavement, had not the stranger caught her in\r\nhis arms.\r\n\r\n\"I will bear her away,\" he said; \"she has a true friend in me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was moving off with his senseless burden, when Francisco, struck\r\nby a sudden idea, caught him by the elegantly slashed sleeve of his\r\ndoublet, and whispered thus, in a rapid tone: \"From the few, but\r\nsignificant words which fell from that lady's lips, and from her still\r\nmore impressive conduct, it would appear, alas! that my deceased father\r\nhad wronged her. If so, signor, it will be my duty to make her all the\r\nreparation that can be afforded in such a case.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis well, my lord,\" answered the stranger, in a cold and haughty tone.\r\n\"To-morrow evening I will call upon you at your palace.\"\r\n\r\nHe then hurried on with the still senseless Agnes in his arms; and the\r\nCount of Riverola retraced his steps to the immediate vicinity of the\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nThis scene, which so strangely interrupted the funeral ceremony, and\r\nwhich has taken so much space to describe, did not actually occupy ten\r\nminutes from the moment when the young lady first appeared in the\r\nchurch, until that when she was borne away by the handsome stranger. The\r\nfuneral obsequies were completed; the coffin was lowered into the family\r\nvault; the spectators dispersed, and the mourners, headed by the young\r\ncount, returned in procession to the Riverola mansion, which was\r\nsituated at no great distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE READING OF THE WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the mourners reached the palace, Francisco led the way to an\r\napartment where Nisida was awaiting their coming.\r\n\r\nFrancisco kissed her affectionately upon the forehead; and then took his\r\nseat at the head of the table, his sister placing herself on his right\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDressed in deep mourning, and with her countenance unusually pale,\r\nNisida's appearance inspired a feeling of profound interest in the minds\r\nof those who did not perceive that, beneath her calm and mournful\r\ndemeanor, feelings of painful intensity agitated within her breast. But\r\nDr. Duras, who knew her well--better, far better than even her own\r\nbrother--noticed an occasional wild flashing of the eye, a nervous\r\nmotion of the lips, and a degree of forced tranquillity of mien, which\r\nproved how acute was the suspense she in reality endured.\r\n\r\nOn Francisco's left hand the notary-general, who had acted as one of the\r\nchief mourners, took a seat. He was a short, thin, middle-aged man, with\r\na pale complexion, twinkling gray eyes, and a sharp expression of\r\ncountenance. Before him lay a sealed packet, on which the eyes of Nisida\r\ndarted, at short intervals, looks, the burning impatience of which were\r\ncomprehended by Dr. Duras alone; for next to Signor Vivaldi, the\r\nnotary-general--and consequently opposite to Nisida--sat the physician.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the company consisted of Father Marco and those most\r\nintimate friends of the family who had been invited to the funeral; but\r\nwhom it is unnecessary to describe more particularly.\r\n\r\nFather Marco having recited a short prayer, in obedience to the custom\r\nof the age, and the occasion, the notary-general proceeded to break the\r\nseals of the large packet which lay before him: then, in a precise and\r\nmethodical manner, he drew forth a sheet of parchment, closely written\r\non.\r\n\r\nNisida leaned her right arm upon the table, and half-buried her\r\ncountenance in the snowy cambric handkerchief which she held.\r\n\r\nThe notary-general commenced the reading of the will.\r\n\r\nAfter bestowing a few legacies, one of which was in favor of Dr. Duras,\r\nand another in that of Signor Vivaldi himself, the testamentary document\r\nordained that the estates of the late Andrea, Count of Riverola, should\r\nbe held in trust by the notary-general and the physician, for the\r\nbenefit of Francisco, who was merely to enjoy the revenues produced by\r\nthe same until the age of thirty, at which period the guardianship was\r\nto cease, and Francisco was then to enter into full and uncontrolled\r\npossession of those immense estates.\r\n\r\nBut to this clause there was an important condition attached; for the\r\ntestamentary document ordained that should the Lady Nisida--either by\r\nmedical skill, or the interposition of Heaven--recover the faculties of\r\nhearing and speaking at any time during the interval which was to elapse\r\nere Francisco would attain the age of thirty, then the whole of the\r\nestates, with the exception of a very small one in the northern part of\r\nTuscany, were to be immediately made over to her; but without the power\r\nof alienation on her part.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that, in the middle ages many titles of nobility\r\ndepended only on the feudal possession of a particular property. This\r\nwas the case with the Riverola estates; and the title of Count of\r\nRiverola was conferred simply by the fact of the ownership of the landed\r\nproperty. Thus, supposing that Nisida became possessed of the estates,\r\nshe would have enjoyed the title of countess, while her brother\r\nFrancisco would have lost that of count.\r\n\r\nWe may also remind our readers that Francisco was now nineteen; and\r\neleven years must consequently elapse ere he could become the lord and\r\nmaster of the vast territorial possessions of Riverola.\r\n\r\nGreat was the astonishment experienced by all who heard the provisions\r\nof this strange will--with the exception of the notary-general and\r\nFather Marco, the former of whom had drawn it up, and the latter of whom\r\nwas privy to its contents (though under a vow of secrecy) in his\r\ncapacity of father-confessor to the late count.\r\n\r\nFrancisco was himself surprised, and, in one sense, hurt; because the\r\nnature of the testamentary document seemed to imply that the property\r\nwould have been inevitably left to his sister, with but a very small\r\nprovision for himself, had she not been so sorely afflicted as she was;\r\nand this fact forced upon him the painful conviction that even when\r\ncontemplating his departure to another world, his father had not\r\nsoftened toward his son!\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, Francisco was pleased that such consideration\r\nhad been shown toward a sister whom he so devotedly loved; and he\r\nhastened, as soon as he could conquer his first emotions, to request the\r\nnotary-general to permit Nisida to peruse the will, adding, in a\r\nmournful tone, \"For all that your excellency has read has been, alas!\r\nunavailing in respect to her.\"\r\n\r\nSignor Vivaldi handed the document to the young count, who gently\r\ntouched his sister's shoulder and placed the parchment before her.\r\n\r\nNisida started as if convulsively, and raised from her handkerchief a\r\ncountenance so pale, so deadly pale, that Francisco shrank back in\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nBut instantly reflecting that the process of reading aloud a paper had\r\nbeen as it were a kind of mockery in respect to his afflicted sister, he\r\npressed her hand tenderly, and made a sign for her to peruse the\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nShe mechanically addressed herself to the task; but ere her eyes--now of\r\nburning, unearthly brilliancy--fell upon the parchment, they darted one\r\nrapid, electric glance of ineffable anguish toward Dr. Duras, adown\r\nwhose cheeks large tears were trickling.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Nisida appeared to be absorbed in the perusal of the\r\nwill; and the most solemn silence prevailed throughout the apartment!\r\n\r\nAt length she started violently, tossed the paper indignantly to the\r\nnotary-general, and hastily wrote on a slip of paper these words:\r\n\r\n\"Should medical skill or the mercy of Heaven restore my speech and\r\nfaculty of hearing, I will abandon all claim to the estates and title of\r\nRiverola to my dear brother Francisco.\"\r\n\r\nShe then handed the slip of paper to the notary-general, who read the\r\ncontents aloud.\r\n\r\nFrancisco darted upon his sister a look of ineffable gratitude and love,\r\nbut shook his head, as much as to imply that he could not accept the\r\nboon even if circumstances enabled her to confer it!\r\n\r\nShe returned the look with another, expressive of impatience at his\r\nrefusal: and her eyes seemed to say, as eyes never yet spoke, \"Oh, that\r\nI had the power to give verbal utterance to my feelings!\"\r\n\r\nMeantime the notary-general had written a few words beneath those penned\r\nby Nisida, to whom he had handed back the slip; and she hastened to read\r\nthem, thus: \"Your ladyship has no power to alienate the estates, should\r\nthey come into your possession.\"\r\n\r\nNisida burst into an agony of tears and rushed from the room.\r\n\r\nHer brother immediately followed to console her; and the company\r\nretired, each individual to his own abode.\r\n\r\nBut of all that company who had been present at the reading of the will,\r\nnone experienced such painful emotions as Dr. Duras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PICTURES--AGNES AND THE UNKNOWN--MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Agnes awoke from the state of stupor in which she had been conveyed\r\nfrom the church, she found herself lying upon an ottoman, in a large and\r\nelegantly furnished apartment.\r\n\r\nThe room was lighted by two silver lamps suspended to the ceiling, and\r\nwhich, being fed with aromatic oil of the purest quality, imparted a\r\ndelicious perfume to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe walls were hung with paintings representing scenes of strange\r\nvariety and interest, and connected with lands far--far away. Thus, one\r\ndepicted a council of red men assembled around a blazing fire, on the\r\nborder of one of the great forests of North America; another showed the\r\ninterior of an Esquimaux hut amidst the eternal ice of the Pole;--a\r\nthird delineated, with fearfully graphic truth, the writhing of a human\r\nvictim in the folds of the terrific anaconda in the island of Ceylon; a\r\nfourth exhibited a pleasing contrast to the one previously cited, by\r\nhaving for its subject a family meeting of Chinese on the terraced roof\r\nof a high functionary's palace at Perkin; a fifth represented the\r\nsplendid court of King Henry the Eighth in London; a sixth showed the\r\ninterior of the harem of the Ottoman Sultan.\r\n\r\nBut there were two portraits amongst this beautiful and varied\r\ncollection of pictures, all of which, we should observe, appeared to\r\nhave been very recently executed--two portraits which we must pause to\r\ndescribe. One represented a tall man of about forty years of age, with\r\nmagnificent light hair--fine blue eyes, but terrible in expression--a\r\ncountenance indisputably handsome, though every lineament denoted horror\r\nand alarm--and a symmetrical form, bowed by the weight of sorrow.\r\nBeneath this portrait was the following inscription:--\"F., _Count of_\r\nA., _terminated his career on the 1st of August, 1517_.\"\r\n\r\nThe other portrait alluded to was that of an old--old man, who had\r\napparently numbered ninety winters. He was represented as cowering over\r\na few embers in a miserable hovel, while the most profound sorrow was\r\ndepicted on his countenance. Beneath this picture was the ensuing\r\ninscription:--\"F. W., _January 7th, 1516. His last day thus._\"\r\n\r\nThere was another feature in that apartment to which we must likewise\r\ndirect our reader's attention, ere we pursue the thread of our\r\nnarrative. This was an object hanging against the wall, next to the\r\nsecond portrait just now described. It also had the appearance of being\r\na picture--or at all events a frame of the same dimensions as the\r\nothers; but whether that frame contained a painting, or whether it were\r\nempty, it was impossible to say, so long as it remained concealed by the\r\nlarge black cloth which covered it, and which was carefully fastened by\r\nsmall silver nails at each corner.\r\n\r\nThis strange object gave a lugubrious and sinister appearance to a room\r\nin other respects cheerful, gay, and elegant.\r\n\r\nBut to resume our tale.\r\n\r\nWhen Agnes awoke from her stupor, she found herself reclining on a soft\r\nottoman of purple velvet, fringed with gold; and the handsome stranger,\r\nwho had borne her from the church, was bathing her brow with water which\r\nhe took from a crystal vase on a marble table.\r\n\r\nAs she slowly and languidly opened her large hazel eyes, her thoughts\r\ncollected themselves in the gradient manner; and when her glance\r\nencountered that of her unknown friend, who was bending over her with an\r\nexpression of deep interest on his features, there flashed upon her mind\r\na recollection of all that had so recently taken place.\r\n\r\n\"Where am I?\" she demanded, starting up, and casting her eyes wildly\r\naround her.\r\n\r\n\"In the abode of one who will not injure you,\" answered the stranger, in\r\na kind and melodious tone.\r\n\r\n\"But who are you? and wherefore have you brought me hither?\" exclaimed\r\nAgnes. \"Oh! remember--you spoke of that old man--my grandfather--the\r\nshepherd of the Black Forest----\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall see him--you shall be restored to him,\" answered the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\n\"But will he receive me--will he not spurn me from him?\" asked Agnes, in\r\na wildly impassioned--almost hysterical tone.\r\n\r\n\"The voice of pity cannot refuse to heave a sigh for thy fall,\" was the\r\nresponse. \"If thou wast guilty in abandoning one who loved thee so\r\ntenderly, and whose earthly reliance was on thee, he, whom you did so\r\nabandon, has not the less need to ask pardon of thee. For he speedily\r\nforgot his darling Agnes--he traveled the world over, yet sought her\r\nnot--her image was, as it were, effaced from his memory. But when\r\naccident----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! signor, you are mistaken--you know not the old man whom I deserted,\r\nand who was a shepherd on the verge of the Black Forest!\" interrupted\r\nAgnes, in a tone expressive of bitter disappointment, \"for he, who loved\r\nme so well, was old--very old, and could not possibly accomplish those\r\nlong wanderings of which you speak. Indeed, if he be still alive--but\r\nthat is scarcely possible----\"\r\n\r\nAnd she burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"Agnes,\" cried the stranger, \"the venerable shepherd of whom you speak\r\naccomplished those wanderings in spite of the ninety winters which\r\nmarked his age. He is alive, too----\"\r\n\r\n\"He is alive!\" ejaculated the lady, with reviving hopes.\r\n\r\n\"He is alive--and at this moment in Florence!\" was the emphatic answer.\r\n\"Did I not ere now tell thee as much in the church?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I remember--but my brain is confused!\" murmured Agnes, pressing\r\nher beautiful white hands upon her polished brow. \"Oh, if he be indeed\r\nalive--and so near me as you say--delay not in conducting me to him; for\r\nhe is now the only being on earth to whom I dare look for solace and\r\nsympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are even now beneath the roof of your grandfather's dwelling,\" said\r\nthe stranger, speaking slowly and anxiously watching the effect which\r\nthis announcement was calculated to produce upon her to whom he\r\naddressed himself.\r\n\r\n\"Here!--this my grandsire's abode!\" she exclaimed, clasping her hands\r\ntogether, and glancing upward, as if to express her gratitude to Heaven\r\nfor this welcome intelligence. \"But how can that old man, whom I left so\r\npoor, have become the owner of this lordly palace? Speak, signor!--all\r\nyou have told me seems to involve some strange mystery,\" she added with\r\nbreathless rapidity. \"Those wanderings of which you ere now\r\nspoke--wanderings over the world, performed by a man bent down by age;\r\nand then this noble dwelling--the appearances of wealth which present\r\nthemselves around--the splendor--the magnificence----\"\r\n\r\n\"All--all are the old man's,\" answered the stranger, \"and may some day\r\nbecome thine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin!\" exclaimed Agnes, sinking upon the ottoman from which she\r\nhad ere now risen, \"I thank thee that thou hast bestowed these blessings\r\non my relative in his old age. And yet,\" she added, again overwhelmed by\r\ndoubts, \"it is scarcely possible--no, it is too romantic to be true!\r\nSignor, thou art of a surety mistaken in him whom thou supposes to be my\r\ngrandsire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me thine hand, Agnes--and I will convince thee,\" said the\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThe young lady complied mechanically; and her unknown friend led her\r\ntoward the portrait of the old man of ninety.\r\n\r\nAgnes recognized the countenance at a single glance, and would have\r\nfallen upon the floor had not her companion supported her in his arms.\r\n\r\nTears again came to her relief; but hastily wiping them away, she\r\nextended her arms passionately toward the portrait, exclaiming, \"Oh! now\r\nI comprehend you, signor! my grandsire lives in this dwelling\r\nindeed--beneath this roof; but lives only in that picture! Alas! alas!\r\nIt was thus, no doubt, that the poor old man seemed when he was\r\nabandoned by me--the lost, the guilty Agnes! It was thus that he sat in\r\nhis lonely dwelling--crushed and overwhelmed by the black ingratitude of\r\nhis granddaughter! Oh! that I had never seen this portrait--this\r\nperpetuation of so much loneliness and so much grief! Ah! too faithful\r\ndelineation of that sad scene which was wrought by me--vainly penitent\r\nthat I am!\"\r\n\r\nAnd covering her face with her hands she threw herself on her knees\r\nbefore the portrait, and gave way to all the bitterness and all the\r\nwildness of her grief.\r\n\r\nThe stranger interrupted her not for some minutes: he allowed the flood\r\nof that anguish to have its full vent: but when it was partially\r\nsubsiding he approached the kneeling penitent, raised her gently, and\r\nsaid, \"Despair not! your grandsire lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"He lives!\" she repeated, her countenance once more expressing radiant\r\nhope, as the sudden gleam of sunshine bursts forth amidst the last drops\r\nof the April shower.\r\n\r\nBut, almost at the same instant that she uttered those words, her eyes\r\ncaught sight of the inscription at the foot of the picture; and,\r\nbounding forward she read it aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin! I am deceived--basely, vilely deceived!\" she continued,\r\nall the violence of her grief, which had begun to ebb so rapidly, now\r\nflowing back upon her soul; then turning abruptly round upon the\r\nstranger, she said in a hoarse hollow tone: \"Signor, wherefore thus\r\nungenerously trifle with my feelings--my best feelings? Who art thou?\r\nwhat would'st thou with me? and wherefore is that portrait here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agnes--Agnes!\" exclaimed her companion, \"compose yourself, I implore\r\nyou! I do not trifle with you--I do not deceive you! Your grandsire,\r\nFernand Wagner, is alive--and in this house. You shall see him\r\npresently; but in the meantime, listen to what I am about to say.\"\r\n\r\nAgnes placed her finger impatiently upon the inscription at the bottom\r\nof the portrait, and exclaimed in a wild, hysterical tone, \"Canst thou\r\nexplain this, signor? 'January 7th, 1516,'--that was about a week after\r\nI abandoned him; and, oh! well indeed might those words be added--'His\r\nlast day thus!'\"\r\n\r\n\"You comprehend not the meaning of that inscription!\" ejaculated the\r\nstranger, in an imploring tone, as if to beseech her to have patience to\r\nlisten to him. \"There is a dreadful mystery connected with Fernand\r\nWagner--connected with me--connected with these two portraits--connected\r\nalso with----\"\r\n\r\nHe checked himself suddenly, and his whole form seemed convulsed with\r\nhorror as he glanced toward the black cloth covering the neighboring\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\"A mystery?\" repeated Agnes. \"Yes--all is mystery: and vague and\r\nundefinable terrors oppress my soul!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt soon--too soon--be enlightened!\" said the stranger, in a\r\nvoice of profound melancholy; \"at least, to a certain extent,\" he added,\r\nmurmuringly. \"But contemplate that other portrait for a few\r\nmoments--that you may make yourself acquainted with the countenance of a\r\nwretch who, in conferring a fearful boon upon your grandsire, has\r\nplunged him into an abyss of unredeemable horror!\"\r\n\r\nAgnes cast her looks toward the portrait of the tall man with the\r\nmagnificent hair, the flashing blue eyes, the wildly expressive\r\ncountenance, and the symmetrical form bowed with affliction; and, having\r\nsurveyed it for some time with repugnance strongly mingled with an\r\ninvincible interest and curiosity, she suddenly pointed toward the\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; there is another terrible memorial!\" cried the stranger. \"But\r\nart thou now prepared to listen to a wondrous--an astonishing tale--such\r\na tale as even nurses would scarcely dare narrate to lull children----\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ prepared,\" answered Agnes. \"I perceive there is a dreadful\r\nmystery connected with my grandsire--with you, also--and perhaps with\r\nme;--and better learn at once the truth, than remain in this state of\r\nintolerable suspense.\"\r\n\r\nHer unknown friend conducted her back to the ottoman, whereon she placed\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHe took a seat by her side, and, after a few moments' profound\r\nmeditation, addressed her in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nREVELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You remember, Agnes, how happily the times passed when you were the\r\ndarling of the old man in his poor cottage. All the other members of his\r\nonce numerous family had been swept away by pestilence, malady,\r\naccident, or violence; and you only were left to him. When the trees of\r\nthis great Black Forest were full of life and vegetable blood, in the\r\ngenial warmth of summer, you gathered flowers which you arranged\r\ntastefully in the little hut; and those gifts of nature, so culled and\r\nso dispensed by your hands, gave the dwelling a more cheerful air than\r\nif it had been hung with tapestry richly fringed. Of an evening, with\r\nthe setting sun, glowing gold, you were wont to kneel by the side of\r\nthat old shepherd; and together ye chanted a hymn giving thanks for the\r\nmercies of the day, and imploring the renewal of them for the morrow.\r\nThen did the music of your sweet voice, as it flowed upon the old man's\r\nears in its melting, silvery tones, possess a charm for his senses which\r\ntaught him to rejoice and be grateful that, though the rest of his race\r\nwas swept away, thou, Agnes, was left!\r\n\r\n\"When the winter came, and the trees were stripped of their verdure, the\r\npoor cottage had still its enjoyments; for though the cold was intense\r\nwithout, yet there were warm hearts within; and the cheerful fire of an\r\nevening, when the labors of the day were passed, seemed to make gay and\r\njoyous companionship.\r\n\r\n\"But suddenly you disappeared; and the old man found himself deserted.\r\nYou left him, too, in the midst of winter--at a time when his age and\r\ninfirmities demanded additional attentions. For two or three days he\r\nsped wearily about, seeking you everywhere in the neighboring district\r\nof the Black Forest. His aching limbs were dragged up rude heights, that\r\nhe might plunge his glances down into the hollow chasms; but still not a\r\ntrace of Agnes! He roved along the precipices overlooking the rustling\r\nstreams, and searched--diligently searched the mazes of the dark wood;\r\nbut still not a trace of Agnes! At length the painful conviction broke\r\nupon him that he was deserted--abandoned; and he would sooner have found\r\nthee a mangled and disfigured corpse in the forest than have adopted\r\nthat belief. Nay--weep not now; it is all past; and if I recapitulate\r\nthese incidents, it is but to convince thee how wretched the old man\r\nwas, and how great is the extenuation for the course which he was so\r\nsoon persuaded to adopt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, who art thou that knowest all this?\" exclaimed Agnes, casting\r\nlooks of alarm upon her companion.\r\n\r\n\"Thou shalt soon learn who I am,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nAgnes still gazed upon him in mingled terror and wonder; for his words\r\nhad gone to her heart, and she remembered how he had embraced her when\r\nshe first encountered him in the church. His manners, too, were so mild,\r\nso kind, so paternal toward her; and yet he seemed but a few years older\r\nthan herself.\r\n\r\n\"You have gazed upon the portrait of the old man,\" he continued, \"as he\r\nappeared on that memorable evening which sealed his fate!\"\r\n\r\nAgnes started wildly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sealed his fate, but spared him his life!\" said the unknown,\r\nemphatically. \"As he is represented in that picture, so was he sitting\r\nmournfully over the sorry fire, for the morrow's renewal of which there\r\nwas no wood! At that hour a man appeared--appeared in the midst of the\r\ndreadful storm which burst over the Black Forest. This man's countenance\r\nis now known to thee; it is perpetuated in the other portrait to which I\r\ndirected thine attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something of a wild and fearful interest in the aspect of that\r\nman,\" said Agnes, casting a shuddering glance behind her, and trembling\r\nlest the canvas had burst into life, and the countenance whose\r\nlineaments were depicted thereon was peering over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and there was much of wild and fearful interest in his history,\"\r\nwas the reply; \"but of that I cannot speak--no, I dare not. Suffice it\r\nto say that he was a being possessed of superhuman powers, and that he\r\nproffered his services to the wretched--the abandoned--the deserted\r\nWagner. He proposed to endow him with a new existence--to restore him to\r\nyouth and manly beauty--to make him rich--to embellish his mind with\r\nwondrous attainments--to enable him to cast off the wrinkles of age----\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin! now I comprehend it all!\" shrieked Agnes, throwing herself\r\nat the feet of her companion: \"and you--_you_----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Fernand Wagner!\" he exclaimed, folding her in his embrace.\r\n\r\n\"And can you pardon me, can you forgive my deep--deep ingratitude?\"\r\ncried Agnes.\r\n\r\n\"Let us forgive each other!\" said Wagner. \"You can now understand the\r\nmeaning of the inscription beneath my portrait. 'His last day thus'\r\nsignifies that it was the last day on which I wore that aged, decrepit,\r\nand sinking form.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore do you say, 'Let us forgive each other?'\" demanded Agnes,\r\nscarcely knowing whether to rejoice or weep at the marvelous\r\ntransformation of her grandsire.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not ere now inform thee that thou wast forgotten until accident\r\nthrew thee in my way to-night?\" exclaimed Fernand. \"I have wandered\r\nabout the earth and beheld all the scenes which are represented in those\r\npictures--ay, and many others equally remarkable. For eighteen months I\r\nwas the servant--and slave of him who conferred upon me this fatal\r\nboon----\"\r\n\r\n\"At what price, then, have you purchased it?\" asked Agnes, with a cold\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\n\"Seek not to learn my secret, girl!\" cried Wagner, almost sternly; then,\r\nin a milder tone, he added, \"By all you deem holy and sacred, I conjure\r\nyou, Agnes, never again to question me on that head! I have told thee as\r\nmuch as it is necessary for thee to know----\"\r\n\r\n\"One word--only one word!\" exclaimed Agnes in an imploring voice. \"Hast\r\nthou bartered thine immortal soul----\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" responded Wagner, emphatically. \"My fate is terrible\r\nindeed--but I am not beyond the pale of salvation. See! Agnes--I kiss\r\nthe crucifix--the symbol of faith and hope!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as he uttered these words, he pressed to his lips an ivory crucifix\r\nof exquisite workmanship, which he took from the table.\r\n\r\n\"The Virgin be thanked that my fearful suspicion should prove\r\nunfounded!\" ejaculated Agnes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I am not altogether lost,\" answered Wagner. \"But _he_--the unhappy\r\nman who made me what I am---- And yet I dare not say more,\" he added,\r\nsuddenly checking himself. \"For one year and a half did I follow him as\r\nhis servitor--profiting by his knowledge--gaining varied information\r\nfrom his experience--passing with the rapidity of thought from clime to\r\nclime--surveying scenes of ineffable bliss, and studying all the\r\nvarieties of misery that fall to the lot of human nature. When he--my\r\nmaster--passed away----\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 1st of August, 1517,\" observed Agnes, quoting from the\r\ninscription beneath the portrait of the individual alluded to.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; when he passed away,\" continued Wagner, \"I continued my wanderings\r\nalone until the commencement of last year, when I settled myself in\r\nFlorence. The mansion to which I have brought you is mine. It is in a\r\nsomewhat secluded spot on the banks of the Arno, and is surrounded by\r\ngardens. My household consists of but few retainers; and they are\r\nelderly persons--docile and obedient. The moment that I entered this\r\nabode, I set to work to paint those portraits to which I have directed\r\nyour attention--likewise these pictures,\" he added, glancing around,\r\n\"and in which I have represented scenes that my own eyes have witnessed.\r\nHere, henceforth, Agnes, shalt thou dwell; and let the past be\r\nforgotten. But there are three conditions which I must impose upon\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Name them,\" said Agnes; \"I promise obedience beforehand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first,\" returned Fernand, \"is that you henceforth look upon me as\r\nyour brother, and call me such when we are alone together or in the\r\npresence of strangers. The second is that you never seek to remove the\r\nblack cloth which covers yon place----\"\r\n\r\nAgnes glanced toward the object alluded to and shuddered--as if the veil\r\nconcealed some new mystery.\r\n\r\n\"And the third condition is that you revive not on any future occasion\r\nthe subject of our present conversation, nor even question me in respect\r\nto those secrets which it may suit me to retain within my own breast.\"\r\n\r\nAgnes promised obedience, and, embracing Wagner, said, \"Heaven has been\r\nmerciful to me, in my present affliction, in that it has given me _a\r\nbrother_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou speakest of thine afflictions, Agnes!\" exclaimed Wagner; \"this is\r\nthe night of revelations and mutual confidences--and this night once\r\npassed, we will never again allude to the present topics, unless events\r\nshould render their revival necessary. It now remains for thee to\r\nnarrate to me all that has befallen thee since the winter of 1516.\"\r\n\r\nAgnes hastened to comply with Fernand's request, and commenced her\r\nhistory in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF AGNES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When you, dear brother--for so I shall henceforth call you--commenced\r\nyour strange and wondrous revelations ere now, you painted in vivid\r\ncolors the happiness which dwelt in our poor cottage on the borders of\r\nthe Black Forest. You saw how deeply your words affected me--I could not\r\nrestrain my tears. Let me not, however, dwell upon this subject; but\r\nrather hasten to explain those powerful causes which induced me to quit\r\nthat happy home.\r\n\r\n\"It was about six weeks before my flight that I went into the forest to\r\ngather wood. I was in the midst of my occupation, gayly thrilling a\r\nnative song, when the sound of a horse's feet upon the hard soil of the\r\nbeaten path suddenly interrupted me. I turned around, seeing a cavalier\r\nof strikingly handsome countenance--though somewhat stern withal, and of\r\nnoble mien. He was in reality forty-four years of age--as I afterward\r\nlearnt; but he seemed scarcely forty, so light did time sit upon his\r\nbrow. His dress was elegant, though of some strange fashion; for it was\r\nItalian costume that he wore. The moment he was close to the spot where\r\nI stood he considered me for a short while, till I felt my cheeks\r\nglowing beneath his ardent gaze. I cast down my eyes; and the next\r\ninstant he had leapt from his horse and was by my side. He addressed me\r\nin gentle terms; and when again I looked at him his countenance no more\r\nseemed stern. It appeared that he was staying with the Baron von\r\nNauemberg, with whom he had been out hunting in the Black Forest, and\r\nfrom whom and his suite he was separated in the ardor of the chase.\r\nBeing a total stranger in those parts, he had lost his way. I\r\nimmediately described to him the proper path for him to pursue; and he\r\noffered me gold as a recompense. I declined the guerdon; and he\r\nquestioned me concerning my family and my position. I told him that I\r\nlived hard-by, with an only relative--a grandsire, to whom I was\r\ndevotedly attached. He lingered long in conversation with me; and his\r\nmanner was so kind, so condescending, and so respectful, that I thought\r\nnot I was doing wrong to listen to him. At length he requested me to be\r\non the same spot at the same hour on the morrow; and he departed.\r\n\r\n\"I was struck by his appearance--dazzled by the brilliancy of his\r\ndiscourse; for he spoke German fluently, although an Italian. He had\r\nmade a deep impression on my mind; and I felt a secret longing to meet\r\nhim again. Suddenly it occurred to me that I was acting with\r\nimpropriety, and that you would be angry with me. I therefore resolved\r\nnot to mention to you my accidental encounter with the handsome\r\ncavalier; but I determined at the same time not to repair to the forest\r\nnext day. When the appointed hour drew near, my good genius deserted me;\r\nand I went. He was there, and he seemed pleased at my punctuality. I\r\nneed not detail to you the nature of the discourse which he held toward\r\nme. Suffice it to say, that he declared how much he had been struck with\r\nmy beauty, and how fondly he would love me; and he dazzled me still more\r\nby revealing his haughty name; and I found that I was beloved by the\r\nCount of Riverola.\r\n\r\n\"You can understand how a poor girl, who had hitherto dwelt in the\r\nseclusion of a cottage on the border of a vast wood, and who seldom saw\r\nany person of higher rank than herself, was likely to be dazzled by the\r\nfine things which that great nobleman breathed in her ear.\r\n\r\n\"And I was dazzled--flattered--excited--bewildered. I consented to meet\r\nhim again: interview followed interview, until I no longer required any\r\npersuasion to induce me to keep the appointments thus given. But there\r\nwere times when my conscience reproached me for conduct which I knew you\r\nwould blame; and yet I dared not unburden my soul to you!\r\n\r\n\"Six weeks thus passed away; I was still innocent--but madly in love\r\nwith the Count of Riverola. He was the subject of my thoughts by day--of\r\nmy dreams by night; and I felt that I could make any sacrifice to retain\r\nhis affection. That sacrifice was too soon demanded! At the expiration\r\nof the six weeks he informed me that on the following day he must return\r\nto Italy, whither important affairs called him sooner than he had\r\nanticipated. He urged me to accompany him; I was bewildered--maddened by\r\nthe contemplation of my duty on the one hand, of my love on the other.\r\nMy guardian saint deserted me; I yielded to the persuasion of the\r\ncount--I became guilty--and there was now no alternative save to fly\r\nwith him!\r\n\r\n\"Oh! believe me when I declare that this decision cost me a dreadful\r\npang; but the count would not leave me time for reflection. He bore me\r\naway on his fleet steed, and halted not until the tall towers of\r\nNauemberg Castle appeared in the distance. Then he stopped at a poor\r\npeasant's cottage, where his gold insured me a welcome reception. Having\r\ncommunicated the plan which he proposed to adopt respecting our journey\r\nto Florence, he took an affectionate leave of me, with a promise to\r\nreturn on the ensuing morning. The remainder of the day was passed\r\nwretchedly enough by me; and I already began to repent of the step I had\r\ntaken. The peasants who occupied the cottage vainly endeavored to cheer\r\nme; my heart was too full to admit of consolation. Night came at length,\r\nand I retired to rest; but my dreams were of so unpleasant a nature--so\r\nfilled with frightful images--that never did I welcome the dawn with\r\nmore enthusiastic joy. Shortly after daybreak the count appeared at the\r\ncottage, attended by one of his numerous suite--a faithful attendant on\r\nwhom he could rely implicitly. They were mounted on good steeds; and\r\nAntonio--such was the name of the servitor--led a third by the bridle.\r\nThis one the count had purchased at an adjacent hamlet, expressly for my\r\nuse. He had also procured a page's attire; for in such disguise was it\r\nagreed that I should accompany the count to Italy.\r\n\r\n\"I should observe that the nobleman, in order to screen our _amour_ as\r\nmuch as possible, had set out from Nauemberg Castle, attended by Antonio\r\nalone, alleging as an excuse that certain affairs compelled him to\r\ntravel homeward with as much celerity as possible. The remainder of his\r\nsuit were therefore ordered to follow at their leisure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! with what agonizing emotion did my heart beat, as, in a private\r\nchamber of the cottage, I laid aside my peasant's garb and donned the\r\ndoublet, hose, cap and cloak of a youthful page. I thought of you--of\r\nyour helplessness--your age,--and also of my native land, which I was\r\nabout to quit--perhaps forever! Still I had gone too far to retreat, and\r\nregrets were useless. I must also confess that when I returned to the\r\nroom where the count was waiting for me, and heard the flattering\r\ncompliments which he paid me on my appearance in that disguise, I\r\nsmiled--yes, I smiled, and much of my remorse vanished!\r\n\r\n\"We set out upon our journey toward the Alps; and the count exerted all\r\nhis powers of conversation to chase away from my mind any regrets or\r\nrepinings that might linger there. Though cold and stern--forbidding and\r\nreserved--haughty and austere in his bearing toward others, to me he was\r\naffectionate and tender. To be brief, yet with sorrow must I confess it,\r\nat the expiration of a few days I could bear to think, without weeping,\r\nof the fond relative whom I had left behind in the cottage of the Black\r\nForest!\r\n\r\n\"We crossed the Alps in safety, but not without experiencing much peril;\r\nand in a short time glorious Italy spread itself out at our feet. The\r\nconversation of the count had already prepared me to admire----\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Agnes' narrative was interrupted by a piercing shriek\r\nwhich burst from her lips; and extending her arms toward the window of\r\nthe apartment, she screamed hysterically, \"Again that countenance!\" and\r\nfell back on the ottoman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF AGNES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may understand how Agnes could perceive any\r\nobject outside the window, in the intense darkness of that tempestuous\r\nnight--or rather morning, for it was now past one o'clock--we must\r\nobserve that not only was the apartment in which Wagner and herself were\r\nseated brilliantly lighted by the silver lamps, but that, according to\r\nFlorentine custom, there were also lamps suspended outside to the\r\nveranda, or large balcony belonging to the casements of the room above.\r\n\r\nAgnes and Wagner were, moreover, placed near the window which looked\r\ninto a large garden attached to the mansion; and thus it was easy for\r\nthe lady, whose eyes happened to be fixed upon the casement in the\r\nearnest interest with which she was relating her narrative, to perceive\r\nthe human countenance that appeared at one of the panes.\r\n\r\nThe moment her history was interrupted by the ejaculation of alarm that\r\nbroke from her lips, Wagner started up and hastened to the window; but\r\nhe could see nothing save the waving evergreens in his garden, and the\r\nlight of a mansion which stood at a distance of about two hundred yards\r\nfrom his own abode.\r\n\r\nHe was about to open the casement and step into the garden, when Agnes\r\ncaught him by the arm, exclaiming wildly, \"Leave me not--I could not--I\r\ncould not bear to remain alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not quit you, Agnes,\" replied Wagner, conducting her back to\r\nthe sofa and resuming his seat by her side. \"But wherefore that\r\nejaculation of alarm? Whose countenance did you behold? Speak, dearest\r\nAgnes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will hasten to explain the cause of my terror,\" retorted Agnes,\r\nbecoming more composed. \"Ere now I was about to detail the particulars\r\nof my journey to Florence, in company with the Count of Riverola, and\r\nattended by Antonio; but as those particulars are of no material\r\ninterest, I will at once pass on to the period when we arrived in this\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the countenance at the window?\" said Wagner, somewhat impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Listen--and you will soon know all,\" replied Agnes. \"It was in the\r\nevening when I entered Florence for the first time. Antonio had\r\nproceeded in advance to inform his mother--a widow who resided in a\r\ndecent house, but in an obscure street near the cathedral--that she was\r\nspeedily to receive a young lady as a guest. This young lady was myself;\r\nand accordingly, when the count assisted me to alight from my horse at\r\nthe gate of Dame Margaretha's abode, the good widow had everything in\r\nreadiness for my reception. The count conversed with her apart for a few\r\nminutes; and I observed that he also placed a heavy purse in her\r\nhand--doubtless to insure her secrecy relative to the _amour_, with the\r\nexistence of which he was of course compelled to acquaint her. Having\r\nseen me comfortably installed in Dame Margaretha's best apartment, he\r\nquitted me, with a promise to return on the morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAgnes paused for a few moments, sighed, and continued her narrative in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately for me, Dame Margaretha was a German woman, who had married\r\nan Italian, otherwise my condition would have been wretched in the\r\nextreme. She treated me with great kindness, mingled with respect; for\r\nthough but a poor peasant girl, I was beloved and protected by one of\r\nthe most powerful nobles of Florence. I retired early to rest:--sleep\r\ndid not, however, immediately visit my eyes! Oh! no--I was in Florence,\r\nbut my thoughts were far away in my native Germany, and on the borders\r\nof the Black Forest. At length I fell into an uneasy slumber, and when I\r\nawoke the sun was shining through the lattice. I arose and dressed\r\nmyself, and to my ineffable delight found that I was no longer to wear\r\nthe garb of a page. That disguise had been removed while I slept, and in\r\nits place were costly vestments, which I donned with a pleasure that\r\ntriumphed over the gloom of my soul. In the course of the morning rich\r\nfurniture was brought to the house, and in a few hours the apartments\r\nallotted to me were converted, in my estimation, into a little paradise.\r\nThe count arrived soon afterward, and I now--pardon me the neglect and\r\ningratitude which my words confess--I now felt very happy. The noble\r\nAndrea enjoined me to go abroad but seldom, and never without being\r\naccompanied by Dame Margaretha; he also besought me not to appear to\r\nrecognize him should I chance to meet him in public at any time, nor to\r\nform acquaintances; in a word, to live retired and secluded as possible,\r\nalike for his sake and my own. I promised compliance with all he\r\nsuggested, and he declared in return that he would never cease to love\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dwell not upon details, Agnes,\" said Wagner; \"for, although I am deeply\r\ninterested in your narrative, my curiosity is strangely excited to learn\r\nthe meaning of that terror which overcame you ere now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will confine myself to material facts as much as possible,\" returned\r\nAgnes. \"Time glided rapidly away;--months flew by, and with sorrow and\r\nshame must I confess that the memories of the past, the memories of the\r\nbright, happy days of my innocence intruded but little on the life which\r\nI led. For, though he was so much older than I, yet I loved the Count of\r\nRiverola devotedly. Oh! Heaven knows how devotedly! His conversation\r\ndelighted, fascinated me; and he seemed to experience a pleasure in\r\nimparting to me the extensive knowledge which he had acquired. To me he\r\nunbent as, doubtless, to human being he never unbent before; in my\r\npresence his sternness, his somber moods, his gloomy thoughts vanished.\r\nIt was evident that he had much preying upon his mind; and perhaps he\r\nloved me thus fondly because--by some unaccountable whim or caprice, or\r\nstrange influence--he found solace in my society. The presents which he\r\nheaped upon me, but which have been nearly all snatched from me, were of\r\nimmense value; and when I remonstrated with him on account of a\r\nliberality so useless to one whom he allowed to want for nothing, he\r\nwould reply, 'But remember, Agnes, when I shall be no more, riches will\r\nconstitute your best friend, your safest protection; for such is the\r\norder of things in this world.' He generally spent two hours with me\r\nevery day, and frequently visited me again in the evening. Thus did time\r\npass; and at length I come to that incident which will explain the\r\nterror I ere now experienced.\"\r\n\r\nAgnes cast a hasty glance toward the window, as if to assure herself\r\nthat the object of her fears was no longer there; and, satisfied on this\r\nhead, she proceeded in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"It was about six months ago that I repaired as usual on the Sabbath\r\nmorning to mass, accompanied by Dame Margaretha, when I found myself the\r\nobject of some attention on the part of a lady, who was kneeling at a\r\nshort distance from the place which I occupied in the church. The lady\r\nwas enveloped in a dark, thick veil, the ample folds of which concealed\r\nher countenance, and meandered over her whole body's splendidly\r\nsymmetrical length of limb in such a manner as to aid her rich attire in\r\nshaping, rather than hiding, the contours of that matchless form. I was\r\nstruck by her fine proportions, which gave her, even in her kneeling\r\nattitude, a queen-like and majestic air; and I longed to obtain a\r\nglimpse of her countenance--the more so as I could perceive by her\r\nmanner and the position of her head that from beneath her dark veil her\r\neyes were intently fixed upon myself. At length the scrutiny to which I\r\nwas thus subjected began to grow so irksome--nay, even alarming, that I\r\nhurriedly drew down my own veil, which I had raised through respect for\r\nthe sacred altar whereat I was kneeling. Still I knew that the stranger\r\nlady was gazing on me; I _felt_ that she was. A certain uneasy\r\nsensation--amounting almost to a superstitious awe--convinced me that I\r\nwas the object of her undivided attention. Suddenly the priests, in\r\nprocession, came down from the altar; and as they passed us, I\r\ninstinctively raised my veil again, through motives of deferential\r\nrespect. At the same instant I glanced toward the stranger lady; she\r\nalso drew back the dark covering from her face. Oh! what a countenance\r\nwas then revealed to me--a countenance of such sovereign beauty that,\r\nthough of the same sex, I was struck with admiration; but, in the next\r\nmoment, a thrill of terror shot through my heart--for the fascination of\r\nthe basilisk could scarcely paralyze its victim with more appalling\r\neffect than did the eyes of that lady. It might be conscience qualms,\r\nexcited by some unknown influence--it might even have been imagination;\r\nbut it nevertheless appeared as if those large, black, burning orbs shot\r\nforth lightnings which seared and scorched my very soul! For that\r\nsplendid countenance, of almost unearthly beauty, was suddenly marked by\r\nan expression of such vindictive rage, such ineffable hatred, such\r\nferocious menace, that I should have screamed had I not been as it were\r\nstunned--stupefied!\r\n\r\n\"The procession of priests swept past. I averted my head from the\r\nstranger lady. In a few moments I again glanced hurriedly at the place\r\nwhich she had occupied--but she was gone. Then I felt relieved! On\r\nquitting the church, I frankly narrated to old Margaretha these\r\nparticulars as I have now unfolded them to you; and methought that she\r\nwas for a moment troubled as I spoke! But if she were, she speedily\r\nrecovered her composure--endeavored to soothe me by attributing it all\r\nto my imagination, and earnestly advised me not to cause any uneasiness\r\nto the count by mentioning the subject to him. I readily promised\r\ncompliance with this injunction; and in the course of a few days ceased\r\nto think upon the incident which has made so strange but evanescent an\r\nimpression on my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless Dame Margaretha was right in her conjecture,\" said Wagner;\r\n\"and your imagination----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no--no! It was not fancy!\" interrupted Agnes, hastily. \"But listen,\r\nand then judge for yourself. I informed you ere now that it was about\r\nsix months ago when the event which I have just related took place. At\r\nthat period, also, my noble lover--the ever-to be lamented Andrea--first\r\nexperienced the symptoms of that internal disease which has, alas!\r\ncarried him to the tomb.\"\r\n\r\nAgnes paused, wiped away her tears, and continued thus:\r\n\r\n\"His visits to me consequently became less frequent;--I was more\r\nalone--for Margaretha was not always a companion who could solace me for\r\nthe absence of one so dearly loved as my Andrea; and repeated fits of\r\ndeep despondency seized upon my soul. At those times I felt as if some\r\nevil--vague and undefinable, but still terrible--were impending over me.\r\nWas it my lord's approaching death of which I had a presentiment? I know\r\nnot! Weeks passed away; the count's visits occurred at intervals growing\r\nlonger and longer--but his affection toward me had not abated. No: a\r\nmalady that preyed upon his vitals retained him much at home;--and at\r\nlast, about two months ago, I received through Antonio the afflicting\r\nintelligence that he was confined to his bed. My anguish now knew no\r\nbounds. I would fly to him--oh! I would fly to him:--who was more worthy\r\nto watch by his couch than I, who so dearly loved him! Dame Margaretha\r\nrepresented to me how painful it would be to his lordship were our\r\n_amour_ to transpire through any rash proceeding on my part--the more\r\nso, as I knew that he had a daughter and a son! I accordingly restrained\r\nmy impetuous longing to hasten to his bedside:--I could not so easily\r\nsubdue my grief!\r\n\r\n\"One night I sat up late in my lonely chamber--pondering on the\r\nmelancholy position in which I was placed,--loving so tenderly, yet not\r\ndaring to fly to him whom I loved,--and giving way to all the mournful\r\nideas which presented themselves to my imagination. At length my mind\r\ngrew bewildered by those sad reflections; vague terrors gathered around\r\nme--multiplying in number and augmenting in intensity,--until at length\r\nthe very figures on the tapestry with which the room was hung appeared\r\nanimated with power to scare and affright me. The wind moaned ominously\r\nwithout, and raised strange echoes within; oppressive feelings crowded\r\non my soul. At length the gale swelled to a hurricane--a whirlwind,\r\nseldom experienced in this delicious clime. Howlings in a thousand tones\r\nappeared to flit through the air; and piercing lamentations seemed to\r\nsound down the black clouds that rolled their mighty volumes together,\r\nveiling the moon and stars in thickest gloom. Overcome with terror, I\r\nretired to rest--and I slept. But troubled dreams haunted me throughout\r\nthe night, and I awoke at an early hour in the morning. But--holy angels\r\nprotect me!--what did I behold? Bending over me, as I lay, was that same\r\ncountenance which I had seen four months before in the church,--and now,\r\nas it was _then_, darting upon me lightning from large black eyes that\r\nseemed to send shafts of flame and fire to the inmost recesses of my\r\nsoul! Yet--distorted as it was with demoniac rage--that face was still\r\nendowed with the queen-like beauty--the majesty of loveliness, which had\r\nbefore struck me, and which even lent force to those looks of dreadful\r\nmenace that were fixed upon me. There were the high forehead--the proud\r\nlip, curled in scorn,--the brilliant teeth, glistening between the\r\nquivering vermilion,--and the swan-like arching of the dazzling neck;\r\nthere also was the dark glory of the luxuriant hair!\r\n\r\n\"For a few moments I was spell-bound--motionless--speechless. Clothed\r\nwith terror and sublimity, yet in all the flush of the most perfect\r\nbeauty, a strange--mysterious being stood over me: and I knew not\r\nwhether she were a denizen of this world, or a spirit risen from\r\nanother. Perhaps the transcendent loveliness of that countenance was but\r\na mask and the wondrous symmetry of that form but a disguise, beneath\r\nwhich all the passions of hell were raging in the brain and in the heart\r\nof a fiend. Such were the ideas that flashed through my imagination; and\r\nI involuntarily closed my eyes, as if this action could avert the\r\nmalignity that appeared to menace me. But dreadful thoughts still\r\npursued me--enveloping me, as it were, in an oppressive mist wherein\r\nappalling though dimly seen images and forms were agitating; and I again\r\nopened my eyes. The lady--if an earthly being she really were--was gone.\r\nI rose from my couch and glanced nervously around--expecting almost to\r\nbehold an apparition come forth from behind the tapestry, or the folds\r\nof the curtains. But my attention was suddenly arrested by a fact more\r\ngermane to worldly occurrences. The casket wherein I kept the rich\r\npresents made to me at different times by my Andrea had been forced open\r\nand the most valuable portion of its contents were gone. On a closer\r\ninvestigation I observed that the articles which were left were those\r\nthat were purchased new; whereas the jewels that had been abstracted\r\nwere old ones, which, as the count had informed me, had belonged to his\r\ndeceased wife.\r\n\r\n\"On discovering this robbery, I began to suspect that my mysterious\r\nvisitress, who had caused me so much alarm, was the thief of my\r\nproperty; and I immediately summoned old Margaretha. She was of course\r\nastounded at the occurrence which I related; and, after some reflection,\r\nshe suddenly remembered that she had forgotten to fasten the house-door\r\nere she retired to rest on the preceding evening. I chided her for a\r\nneglect which had enabled some evil-disposed woman to penetrate into my\r\nchamber, and not only terrify but also plunder me. She implored my\r\nforgiveness, and besought me not to mention the incident to the count\r\nwhen next we met. Alas! my noble Andrea and I never met again.\r\n\r\n\"I was sorely perplexed by the event which I have just related. If the\r\nmysterious visitress were a common thief, why did she leave any of the\r\njewels in the casket? and wherefore had she on two occasions\r\ncontemplated me with looks of such dark rage and infernal menace? A\r\nthought struck me. Could the count's daughter have discovered our\r\n_amour_? and was it she who had come to gain possession of jewels\r\nbelonging to the family? I hinted my suspicions to Margaretha; but she\r\nspeedily convinced me that they were unfounded.\r\n\r\n\"'The Lady Nisida is deaf and dumb,' she said, 'and cannot possibly\r\nexercise such faculties of observation, nor adopt such means of\r\nobtaining information as would make her acquainted with all that has\r\noccurred between her father and yourself. Besides--she is constantly in\r\nattendance on her sire, who is very, very ill.\r\n\r\n\"I now perceived the improbability of a deaf and dumb female discovering\r\nan _amour_ so carefully concealed; but to assure myself more fully on\r\nthat head, I desired Margaretha to describe the Lady Nisida. This she\r\nreadily did, and I learnt from her that the count's daughter was of a\r\nbeauty quite different from the lady whom I had seen in the church and\r\nin my own chamber. In a word, it appears that Nisida has light hair,\r\nblue eyes and a delicate form: whereas, the object of my interest,\r\ncuriosity, and fear, is a woman of dark Italian loveliness.\r\n\r\n\"I have little more now to say. The loss of the jewels and the\r\nrecollection of the mysterious lady were soon absorbed in the\r\ndistressing thoughts which the serious illness of the count forced upon\r\nmy mind. Weeks passed away, and he came not; but he sent repeated\r\nmessages by Antonio, imploring me to console myself, as he should soon\r\nrecover, and urging me not to take any step that might betray the\r\nexistence of our _amour_. Need I say how religiously I obeyed him in the\r\nlatter respect? Day after day did I hope to see him again, for I knew\r\nnot that he was dying: and I used to dress myself in my gayest\r\nattire--even as now I am appareled--to welcome his expected visit. Alas!\r\nhe never came; and his death was concealed from me, doubtless that the\r\nsad event might not be communicated until after the funeral, lest in the\r\nfirst frenzy of anguish I should rush to the Riverola palace to imprint\r\na last kiss upon the cheek of the corpse. But a few hours ago, I learned\r\nthe whole truth from two female friends of Dame Margaretha who called to\r\nvisit her, and whom I had hastened to inform that she was temporarily\r\nabsent. My noble Andrea was dead, and at that very moment his funeral\r\nobsequies were being celebrated in the neighboring church--the very\r\nchurch in which I had first beheld the mysterious lady! Frantic with\r\ngrief--unmindful of the exposure that would ensue--reckless of the\r\nconsequences, I left the house--I hastened to the church--I intruded my\r\npresence amidst the mourners. You know the rest, Fernand. It only\r\nremains for me to say that the countenance which I beheld ere now at the\r\nwindow--strongly delineated and darkly conspicuous amidst the blaze of\r\nlight outside the casement--was that of the lady whom I have thus seen\r\nfor the third time! But, tell me, Fernand, how could a stranger thus\r\nobtain admission to the gardens of your mansion?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see yon lights, Agnes!\" said Wagner, pointing toward the mansion\r\nwhich, as we stated at the commencement of that chapter, was situated at\r\na distance of about two hundred yards from Fernand's dwelling, the backs\r\nof the two houses thus looking toward each other. \"Those lights,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"are shining in a mansion the gardens of which are separated\r\nfrom my own by a simple hedge of evergreens, that would not bar even the\r\npassage of a child. Should any inmate of that mansion possess curiosity\r\nsufficient to induce him or her to cross the boundary, traverse my\r\ngardens, and approach the casements of my residence, that curiosity may\r\nbe easily gratified.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to whom does yon mansion belong?\" asked Agnes.\r\n\r\n\"To Dr. Duras, an eminent physician,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Duras, the physician who attended my noble Andrea in his illness!\"\r\nexclaimed Agnes. \"Then the mysterious lady of whom I have spoken so\r\nmuch, and whose countenance ere now appeared at the casement, must be an\r\ninmate of the house of Dr. Duras; or at all events, a visitor there! Ah!\r\nsurely there is some connection between that lady and the family at\r\nRiverola?\"\r\n\r\n\"Time will solve the mystery, dearest sister, for so I am henceforth to\r\ncall you,\" said Fernand. \"But beneath this roof, no harm can menace you.\r\nAnd now let me summon good Dame Paula, my housekeeper, to conduct you to\r\nthe apartments which have been prepared for your reception. The morning\r\nis far advanced, and we both stand in need of rest.\"\r\n\r\nDame Paula, an elderly, good-tempered, kind-hearted matron, shortly made\r\nher appearance; and to her charge did Wagner consign his newly-found\r\nrelative, whom he now represented to be his sister.\r\n\r\nBut as Agnes accompanied the worthy woman from the apartment, she\r\nshuddered involuntarily as she passed the frame which was covered with\r\nthe black cloth, and which seemed ominous amidst the blaze of light that\r\nfilled the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO, WAGNER AND NISIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the ensuing evening, Francisco, Count of Riverola, was seated in one\r\nof the splendid saloons of his palace, pondering upon the strange\r\ninjunction which he had received from his deceased father, relative to\r\nthe mysterious closet, when Wagner was announced.\r\n\r\nFrancisco rose to receive him, saying in a cordial though melancholy\r\ntone, \"Signor, I expected you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And let me hasten to express the regret which I experienced at having\r\naddressed your lordship coldly and haughtily last night,\" exclaimed\r\nWagner. \"But, at the moment, I only beheld in you the son of him who had\r\ndishonored a being very dear to my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can well understand your feelings on that occasion, signor,\" replied\r\nFrancisco. \"Alas! the sins of the fathers are too often visited upon the\r\nchildren in this world. But, in whatever direction our present\r\nconversation may turn, I implore you to spare as much as possible the\r\nmemory of my sire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think not, my lord,\" said Wagner, \"that I should be so ungenerous as to\r\nreproach you for a deed in which you had no concern, and over which you\r\nexercised no control. Nor should I inflict so deep an injury upon you,\r\nas to speak in disrespectful terms of him who was the author of your\r\nbeing, but who is now no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your kind language has already made me your friend,\" exclaimed\r\nFrancisco. \"And now point out to me in what manner I can in any way\r\nrepair--or mitigate--the wrong done to that fair creature in whom you\r\nexpress yourself interested.\"\r\n\r\n\"That young lady is my sister,\" said Wagner, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Your sister, signor! And yet, meseems, she recognized you not----\"\r\n\r\n\"Long years have passed since we saw each other,\" interrupted Fernand;\r\n\"for we were separated in our childhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you not both speak of some relative--an old man who once dwelt\r\non the confines of the Black Forest of Germany, but who is now in\r\nFlorence?\" asked Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"Alas! that old man is no more,\" returned Wagner. \"I did but use his\r\nname to induce Agnes to place confidence in me, and allow me to withdraw\r\nher from a scene which her wild grief so unpleasantly interrupted; for I\r\nthought that were I then and there to announce myself as her brother,\r\nshe might not believe me--she might suspect some treachery or snare in a\r\ncity so notoriously profligate as Florence. But the subsequent\r\nexplanations which took place between us cleared up all doubts on that\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am well pleased to hear that the poor girl has found so near a\r\nrelative and so dear a friend, signor,\" said Francisco. \"And now\r\nacquaint me, I pray thee, with the means whereby I may, to some extent,\r\nrepair the injury your sister has sustained at the hands of him whose\r\nmemory I implore you to spare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wealth I possess in abundance--oh! far greater abundance than is\r\nnecessary to satisfy all my wants!\" exclaimed Wagner, with something of\r\nbitterness and regret in his tone; \"but, even were I poor, gold would\r\nnot restore my sister's honor. No--let that subject, however, pass. I\r\nwould only ask you, count, whether there be any scion of your\r\nfamily--any lady connected with you--who answers this description?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Wagner proceeded to delineate, in minute terms, the portraiture of\r\nthe mysterious lady who had inspired Agnes on three occasions with so\r\nmuch terror, and whom Agnes herself had depicted in such glowing\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\"Signor! you are describing the Lady Nisida, my sister!\" exclaimed\r\nFrancisco, struck with astonishment at the fidelity of the portrait thus\r\nverbally drawn.\r\n\r\n\"Your sister, my lord!\" cried Wagner. \"Then has Dame Margaretha deceived\r\nAgnes in representing the Lady Nisida to be rather a beauty of the cold\r\nnorth than of the sunny south.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dame Margaretha!\" said Francisco; \"do you allude, signor, to the mother\r\nof my late father's confidential dependent, Antonio?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same,\" was the answer. \"It was at Dame Margaretha's house that your\r\nfather placed my sister Agnes, who has resided there nearly four years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore have you made those inquiries relative to the Lady\r\nNisida?\" inquired Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"I will explain the motive with frankness,\" responded Wagner.\r\n\r\nHe then related to the young count all those particulars relative to the\r\nmysterious lady and Agnes, with which the reader is already acquainted.\r\n\r\n\"There must be some extraordinary mistake--some strange error, signor,\r\nin all this,\" observed Francisco. \"My poor sister is, as you seem to be\r\naware, so deeply afflicted that she possesses not faculties calculated\r\nto make her aware of that _amour_ which even I, who possess those\r\nfaculties in which she is deficient, never suspected, and concerning\r\nwhich no hint ever reached me, until the whole truth burst suddenly upon\r\nme last night at the funeral of my sire. Moreover, had accident revealed\r\nto Nisida the existence of the connection between my father and your\r\nsister, signor, she would have imparted the discovery to me, such is the\r\nconfidence and so great is the love that exists between us. For habit\r\nhas rendered us so skillful and quick in conversing with the language of\r\nthe deaf and dumb, that no impediment ever exists to the free\r\ninterchange of our thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, if the Lady Nisida _had_ made such a discovery, her hatred of\r\nAgnes may be well understood,\" said Wagner; \"for her ladyship must\r\nnaturally look upon my sister as the partner of her father's\r\nweakness--the dishonored slave of his passions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida has no secret from me,\" observed the young count, firmly.\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore did Dame Margaretha deceive my sister in respect to the\r\npersonal appearance of the Lady Nisida?\" inquired Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"I know not. At the same time----\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and Nisida entered the apartment.\r\n\r\nShe was attired in deep black; her luxuriant raven hair, no longer\r\ndepending in shining curls, was gathered up in massy bands at the sides,\r\nand a knot behind, whence hung a rich veil that meandered over her\r\nbody's splendidly symmetrical length of limb in such a manner as to aid\r\nher attire in shaping rather than hiding the contours of that matchless\r\nform. The voluptuous development of her bust was shrouded, not\r\nconcealed, by the stomacher of black velvet which she wore, and which\r\nset off in strong relief the dazzling whiteness of her neck.\r\n\r\nThe moment her lustrous dark eyes fell upon Fernand Wagner, she started\r\nslightly; but this movement was imperceptible alike to him whose\r\npresence caused it, and to her brother.\r\n\r\nFrancisco conveyed to her, by the rapid language of the fingers, the\r\nname of their visitor, and at the same time intimated to her that he was\r\nthe brother of Agnes, the young and lovely female whose strange\r\nappearance at the funeral, and avowed connection with the late noble,\r\nhad not been concealed from the haughty lady.\r\n\r\nNisida's eyes seemed to gleam with pleasure when she understood in what\r\ndegree of relationship Wagner stood toward Agnes; and she bowed to him\r\nwith a degree of courtesy seldom displayed by her to strangers.\r\n\r\nFrancisco then conveyed to her in the language of the dumb, all those\r\ndetails already related in respect to the \"mysterious lady\" who had so\r\nhaunted the unfortunate Agnes.\r\n\r\nA glow of indignation mounted to the cheeks of Nisida; and more than\r\nusually rapid was the reply she made through the medium of the alphabet\r\nof the fingers.\r\n\r\n\"My sister desires me to express to you, signor,\" said Francisco,\r\nturning toward Wagner, \"that she is not the person whom the Lady Agnes\r\nhas to complain against. My sister,\" he continued, \"has never to her\r\nknowledge seen the Lady Agnes; much less has she ever penetrated into\r\nher chamber; and indignantly does she repel the accusation relative to\r\nthe abstraction of the jewels. She also desires me to inform you that\r\nlast night after reading of our father's last testament, she retired to\r\nher chamber, which she did not quit until this morning at the usual\r\nhour; and that therefore it was not her countenance which the Lady Agnes\r\nbeheld at the casement of your saloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray you, my lord, to let the subject drop now, and forever!\" said\r\nWagner, who was struck with profound admiration--almost amounting to\r\nlove--for the Lady Nisida: \"there is some strange mystery in all this,\r\nwhich time alone can clear up. Will your lordship express to your sister\r\nhow grieved I am that any suspicion should have originated against her\r\nin respect to Agnes?\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco signaled these remarks to Nisida; and the latter, rising from\r\nher seat, advanced toward Wagner, and presented him her hand in token of\r\nher readiness to forget the injurious imputations thrown out against\r\nher.\r\n\r\nFernand raised that fair hand to his lips, and respectfully kissed it;\r\nbut the hand seemed to burn as he held it, and when he raised his eyes\r\ntoward the lady's countenance, she darted on him a look so ardent and\r\nimpassioned that it penetrated into his very soul.\r\n\r\nThat rapid interchange of glances seemed immediately to establish a kind\r\nof understanding--a species of intimacy between those extraordinary\r\nbeings; for on the one side, Nisida read in the fine eyes of the\r\nhandsome Fernand all the admiration expressed there, and he, on his\r\npart, instinctively understood that he was far from disagreeable to the\r\nproud sister of the young Count of Riverola. While he was ready to fall\r\nat her feet and do homage to her beauty, she experienced the kindling of\r\nall the fierce fires of sensuality in her breast.\r\n\r\nBut the unsophisticated and innocent-minded Francisco observed not the\r\nexpression of these emotions on either side, for their manifestation\r\noccupied not a moment. The interchange of such feelings is ever too\r\nvivid and electric to attract the notice of the unsuspecting observer.\r\n\r\nWhen Wagner was about to retire, Nisida made the following signal to her\r\nbrother:--\"Express to the signor that he will ever be a welcome guest at\r\nthe palace of Riverola; for we owe kindness and friendship to the\r\nbrother of her whom our father dishonored.\"\r\n\r\nBut, to the astonishment of both the count and the Lady Nisida, Wagner\r\nraised his hands, and displayed as perfect a knowledge of the language\r\nof the dumb as they themselves possessed.\r\n\r\n\"I thank your ladyship for this unexpected condescension,\" he signaled\r\nby the rapid play of his fingers; \"and I shall not forget to avail\r\nmyself of this most courteous invitation.\"\r\n\r\nIt were impossible to describe the sudden glow of pleasure and delight\r\nwhich animated Nisida's splendid countenance, when she thus discovered\r\nthat Wagner was able to hold converse with her, and she hastened to\r\nreply thus: \"We shall expect you to revisit us soon.\"\r\n\r\nWagner bowed low and took his departure, his mind full of the beautiful\r\nNisida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nNISIDA AND WAGNER--FRANCISCO AND FLORA--THE APPROACH OF SUNSET.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpward of two months had passed away since the occurrences related in\r\nthe preceding chapter, and it was now the 31st of January, 1521.\r\n\r\nThe sun was verging toward the western hemisphere, but the rapid flight\r\nof the hours was unnoticed by Nisida and Fernand Wagner, as they were\r\nseated together in one of the splendid saloons of the Riverola mansion.\r\n\r\nTheir looks were fixed on each other's countenance; the eyes of Fernand\r\nexpressing tenderness and admiration, those of Nisida beaming with all\r\nthe passions of her ardent and sensual soul.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the lady raised her hands, and by the rapid play of the\r\nfingers, asked, \"Fernand, do you indeed love me as much as you would\r\nhave me believe I am beloved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never in this world was woman so loved as you,\" he replied, by the aid\r\nof the same language.\r\n\r\n\"And yet I am an unfortunate being--deprived of those qualities which\r\ngive the greatest charm to the companionship of those who love.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are eminently beautiful, my Nisida; and I can fancy how sweet,\r\nhow rich-toned would be your voice, could your lips frame the words, '_I\r\nlove thee!_'\"\r\n\r\nA profound sigh agitated the breast of the lady; and at the same time\r\nher lips quivered strangely, as if she were essaying to speak.\r\n\r\nWagner caught her to his breast; and she wept long and plenteously.\r\nThose tears relieved her; and she returned his warm, impassioned kisses\r\nwith an ardor that convinced him how dear he had become to that\r\nafflicted, but transcendently beautiful being. On her side, the blood in\r\nher veins appeared to circulate like molten lead; and her face, her\r\nneck, her bosom were suffused with burning blushes.\r\n\r\nAt length, raising her head, she conveyed this wish to her companion:\r\n\"Thou hast given me an idea which may render me ridiculous in your\r\nestimation; but it is a whim, a fancy, a caprice, engendered only by the\r\nprofound affection I entertain for thee. I would that thou shouldst say,\r\nin thy softest, tenderest tones, the words '_I love thee!_' and, by the\r\nwreathing of thy lips, I shall see enough to enable my imagination to\r\npersuade itself that those words have really fallen upon my ears.\"\r\n\r\nFernand smiled assent; and, while Nisida's eyes were fixed upon him with\r\nthe most enthusiastic interest, he said, \"I love thee!\"\r\n\r\nThe sovereign beauty of her countenance was suddenly lighted up with an\r\nexpression of ineffable joy, of indescribable delight; and, signaling\r\nthe assurance, \"I love thee, dearest, dearest Fernand!\" she threw\r\nherself into his arms.\r\n\r\nBut almost at the same moment voices were heard in the adjacent room:\r\nand Wagner, gently disengaging himself from Nisida's embrace, hastily\r\nconveyed to her an intimation of the vicinity of others.\r\n\r\nThe lady gave him to understand by a glance that she comprehended him;\r\nand they remained motionless, fondly gazing upon each other.\r\n\r\n\"I know not how it has occurred, Flora,\" said the voice of Francisco,\r\nspeaking in a tender tone, in the adjoining room--\"I know not how it has\r\noccurred that I should have addressed you in this manner--so soon, too,\r\nafter the death of my lamented father, and while these mourning garments\r\nyet denote the loss which myself and sister have sustained----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my lord, suffer me to retire,\" exclaimed Flora Francatelli, in a\r\ntone of beseeching earnestness; \"I should not have listened to your\r\nlordship so long in the gallery of pictures, much less have accompanied\r\nyour lordship hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"I requested thee to come with me to this apartment, Flora, that I might\r\ndeclare, without fear of our interview being interrupted, how dear, how\r\nvery dear, thou art to me, and how honorable is the passion with which\r\nthou hast inspired me. Oh, Flora,\" exclaimed the young count, \"I could\r\nno longer conceal my love for thee! My heart was bursting to reveal its\r\nsecret; and when I discovered thee alone, ere now, in the gallery of\r\npictures, I could not resist the favorable opportunity accident seemed\r\nto have afforded for this avowal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my lord,\" murmured Flora, \"I know not whether to rejoice or be\r\nsorrowful at the revelation which has this day met my ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you said ere now that you could love me, that you did love me\r\nin return,\" ejaculated Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"I spoke truly, my lord,\" answered the bashful maiden; \"but, alas! how\r\ncan the humble, obscure, portionless Flora become the wife of the rich,\r\npowerful and honored Count of Riverola? There is an inseparable gulf\r\nfixed between us, my lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not my own master? Can I not consult my own happiness in that most\r\nsolemn and serious of the world's duties--marriage?\" cried Francisco,\r\nwith all the generous ardor of youth and his own noble disposition.\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship is free and independent in point of fact,\" said Flora, in\r\na low, tender and yet impressive tone; \"but your lordship has\r\nrelations--friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"My relations will not thwart the wishes of him whom they love,\"\r\nanswered Francisco; \"and those who place obstacles in the way of my\r\nfelicity cannot be denominated my friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my lord--could I yield myself up to the hopes which your language\r\ninspires!\" cried Flora.\r\n\r\n\"You can--you may, dearest girl!\" exclaimed the young count. \"And now I\r\nknow that you love me! But many months must elapse ere I can call thee\r\nmine; and, indeed, a remorse smites my heart that I have dared to think\r\nof my own happiness, so soon after a mournful ceremony has consigned a\r\nparent to the tomb. Heaven knows that I do not the less deplore his\r\nloss--but wherefore art thou so pale, so trembling, Flora?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meseems that a superstitious awe of evil omens has seized upon my\r\nsoul,\" returned the maiden, in a tremulous tone. \"Let us retire, my\r\nlord; the Lady Nisida may require my services elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida!\" repeated Francisco, as if the mention of his sister's name had\r\nsuddenly awakened new ideas in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my lord,\" said Flora, sorrowfully, \"you now perceive that there is\r\nat least one who may not learn with satisfaction the alliance which your\r\nlordship would form with the poor and humble dependent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, by my patron saint, thou hast misunderstood me!\" exclaimed the\r\nyoung count warmly. \"Nisida will not oppose her brother's happiness; and\r\nher strong mind will know how to despise those conventional usages which\r\nrequire that high birth should mate with high birth, and wealth ally\r\nitself to wealth. Yes; Nisida will consult my felicity alone; and when I\r\nere now repeated her name as it fell from your lips, it was in a manner\r\nreproachful to myself, because I have retained my love for thee a secret\r\nfrom her. A secret from Nisida! Oh! I have been cruel, unjust, not to\r\nhave confided in my sister long ago! And yet,\" he added more slowly,\r\n\"she might reproach me for my selfishness in bestowing a thought on\r\nmarriage soon, so very soon, after a funeral! Flora, dearest maiden,\r\ncircumstances demand that the avowal which accident and opportunity have\r\nled me this day to make, should exist as a secret, known only unto\r\nyourself and me. But, in a few months I will explain all to my sister,\r\nand she will greet thee as her brother's chosen bride. Are thou content,\r\nFlora, that our mutual love should remain thus concealed until the\r\nproper time shall come for its revelation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord, and for many reasons,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\n\"For many reasons, Flora!\" exclaimed the young count.\r\n\r\n\"At least for more than one,\" rejoined the maiden. \"In the first\r\ninstance, it is expedient your lordship should have due leisure to\r\nreflect upon the important step which you propose to take--a step\r\nconferring so much honor on myself, but which may not insure your\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this be a specimen of thy reasons, dear maiden,\" exclaimed\r\nFrancisco, laughing, \"I need hear no more. Be well assured,\" he added\r\nseriously, \"that time will not impair the love I experience for you.\"\r\n\r\nFlora murmured a reply which did not reach Wagner, and immediately\r\nafterward the sound of her light steps was heard retreating from the\r\nadjacent room. A profound silence of a few minutes occurred; and then\r\nFrancisco also withdrew.\r\n\r\nWagner had been an unwilling listener to the preceding conversation; but\r\nwhile it was in progress, he from time to time threw looks of love and\r\ntenderness on his beautiful companion, who returned them with\r\nimpassioned ardor.\r\n\r\nWhether it were that her irritable temper was impatient of the restraint\r\nimposed upon herself and her lover by the vicinity of others, or whether\r\nshe was annoyed at the fact of her brother and Flora being so long\r\ntogether (for Wagner had intimated to her who their neighbors were, the\r\nmoment he had recognized their voices), we cannot say; but Nisida showed\r\nan occasional uneasiness of manner, which she, however, studied to\r\nsubdue as much as possible, during the scene that took place in the\r\nadjoining apartment.\r\n\r\nFernand did not offer to convey to her any idea of the nature of the\r\nconversation which occupied her brother and Flora Francatelli; neither\r\ndid she manifest the least curiosity to be enlightened on that head.\r\n\r\nThe moment the young lovers had quitted the next room Wagner intimated\r\nthe fact to Nisida; but at the same instant, just as he was about to\r\nbestow upon her a tender caress, a dreadful, an appalling reminiscence\r\nburst upon him with such overwhelming force that he fell back stupefied\r\non the sofa.\r\n\r\nNisida's countenance assumed an expression of the deepest solicitude,\r\nand her eloquent, sparkling eyes, implored him to intimate to her what\r\nailed him.\r\n\r\nBut, starting wildly from his seat, and casting on her a look of such\r\nbitter, bitter anguish, that the appalling emotions thus expressed\r\nstruck terror to her soul--Fernand rushed from the room.\r\n\r\nNisida sprung to the window; and, though the obscurity of the evening\r\nnow announced the last flickerings of the setting sunbeams in the west,\r\nshe could perceive her lover dashing furiously on through the spacious\r\ngardens that surrounded the Riverola Palace.\r\n\r\nOn--on he went toward the River Arno; and in a few minutes was out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nAlas! intoxicated with love, and giving himself up to the one delightful\r\nidea--that he was with the beauteous Nisida--then, absorbed in the\r\ninterest of the conversation which he had overheard between Francisco\r\nand Flora--Wagner had forgotten until it was nearly too late, _that the\r\nsun was about to set on the last day of the month_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE WEHR-WOLF.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Twas the hour of sunset.\r\n\r\nThe eastern horizon, with its gloomy and somber twilight, offered a\r\nstrange contrast to the glorious glowing hues of vermilion, and purple,\r\nand gold, that blended in long streaks athwart the western sky.\r\n\r\nFor even the winter sunset of Italy is accompanied with resplendent\r\ntints--as if an emperor, decked with a refulgent diadem, were repairing\r\nto his imperial couch.\r\n\r\nThe declining rays of the orb of light bathed in molten gold the\r\npinnacles, steeples, and lofty palaces of proud Florence, and toyed with\r\nthe limpid waves of the Arno, on whose banks innumerable villas and\r\ncasinos already sent forth delicious strains of music, broken only by\r\nthe mirth of joyous revelers.\r\n\r\nAnd by degrees as the sun went down, the palaces of the superb city\r\nbegan to shed light from their lattices, set in rich sculptured masonry;\r\nand here and there, where festivity prevailed, grand illuminations\r\nsprung up with magical quickness, the reflection from each separate\r\ngalaxy rendering it bright as day far, far around.\r\n\r\nVocal and instrumental melody floated through the still air; and the\r\nperfume of exotics, decorating the halls of the Florentine nobles,\r\npoured from the widely-opened portals, and rendered the air delicious.\r\n\r\nFor Florence was gay that evening--the last day of each month being the\r\none which the wealthy lords and high-born ladies set apart for the\r\nreception of their friends.\r\n\r\nThe sun sank behind the western hills; and even the hothouse flowers\r\nclosed up their buds--as if they were eyelids weighed down by slumber,\r\nand not to wake until the morning should arouse them again to welcome\r\nthe return of their lover--that glorious sun!\r\n\r\nDarkness seemed to dilate upon the sky like an image in the midst of a\r\nmirage, expanding into superhuman dimensions--then rapidly losing its\r\nshapeliness, and covering the vault above densely and confusedly.\r\n\r\nBut, by degrees, countless stars began to stud the colorless canopy of\r\nheaven, like gems of orient splendor; for the last--last flickering ray\r\nof the twilight in the west had expired in the increasing obscurity.\r\n\r\nBut, hark! what is that wild and fearful cry?\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a wood of evergreens on the banks of the Arno, a\r\nman--young, handsome, and splendidly attired--has thrown himself upon\r\nthe ground, where he writhes like a stricken serpent, in horrible\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nHe is the prey of a demoniac excitement: an appalling consternation is\r\non him--madness is in his brain--his mind is on fire.\r\n\r\nLightnings appear to gleam from his eyes, as if his soul were dismayed,\r\nand withering within his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no--no!\" he cries with a piercing shriek, as if wrestling madly,\r\nfuriously, but vainly against some unseen fiend that holds him in his\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nAnd the wood echoes to that terrible wail; and the startled bird flies\r\nfluttering from its bough.\r\n\r\nBut, lo! what awful change is taking place in the form of that doomed\r\nbeing? His handsome countenance elongates into one of savage and\r\nbrute-like shape; the rich garments which he wears become a rough,\r\nshaggy, and wiry skin; his body loses its human contours, his arms and\r\nlimbs take another form; and, with a frantic howl of misery, to which\r\nthe woods give horribly faithful reverberations, and, with a rush like a\r\nhurling wind, the wretch starts wildly away, no longer a man, but a\r\nmonstrous wolf!\r\n\r\nOn, on he goes: the wood is cleared--the open country is gained. Tree,\r\nhedge, and isolated cottage appear but dim points in the landscape--a\r\nmoment seen, the next left behind; the very hills appear to leap after\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nA cemetery stands in the monster's way, but he turns not aside--through\r\nthe sacred inclosure--on, on he goes. There are situated many tombs,\r\nstretching up the slope of a gentle acclivity, from the dark soil of\r\nwhich the white monuments stand forth with white and ghastly gleaming,\r\nand on the summit of the hill is the church of St. Benedict the Blessed.\r\n\r\nFrom the summit of the ivy-grown tower the very rooks, in the midst of\r\ntheir cawing, are scared away by the furious rush and the wild howl with\r\nwhich the Wehr-Wolf thunders over the hallowed ground.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a train of monks appear round the angle of the\r\nchurch--for there is a funeral at that hour; and their torches flaring\r\nwith the breeze that is now springing up, cast an awful and almost\r\nmagical light on the dark gray walls of the edifice, the strange effect\r\nbeing enhanced by the prismatic reflection of the lurid blaze from the\r\nstained glass of the oriel window.\r\n\r\nThe solemn spectacle seemed to madden the Wehr-Wolf. His speed\r\nincreased--he dashed through the funeral train--appalling cries of\r\nterror and alarm burst from the lips of the holy fathers--and the solemn\r\nprocession was thrown into confusion. The coffin-bearers dropped their\r\nburden, and the corpse rolled out upon the ground, its decomposing\r\ncountenance seeming horrible by the glare of the torch-light.\r\n\r\nThe monk who walked nearest the head of the coffin was thrown down by\r\nthe violence with which the ferocious monster cleared its passage; and\r\nthe venerable father--on whose brow sat the snow of eighty winters--fell\r\nwith his head against a monument, and his brains were dashed out.\r\n\r\nOn, on fled the Wehr-Wolf, over mead and hill, through valley and dale.\r\nThe very wind seemed to make way: he clove the air--he appeared to skim\r\nthe ground--to fly.\r\n\r\nThrough the romantic glades and rural scenes of Etruria the monster\r\nsped--sounds, resembling shrieking howls, bursting ever and anon from\r\nhis foaming mouth--his red eyes glaring in the dusk of the evening like\r\nominous meteors--and his whole aspect so full of appalling ferocity,\r\nthat never was seen so monstrous, so terrific a spectacle!\r\n\r\nA village is gained; he turns not aside, but dashes madly through the\r\nlittle street formed by the huts and cottages of the Tuscan\r\nvine-dressers.\r\n\r\nA little child is in his path--a sweet, blooming, ruddy, noble boy; with\r\nviolet-colored eyes and flaxen hair--disporting merrily at a short\r\ndistance from his parents, who are seated at the threshold of their\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a strange and ominous rush--an unknown trampling of rapid feet\r\nfalls upon their ears; then, with a savage cry, a monster sweeps past.\r\n\r\n\"My child! my child!\" screams the affrighted mother; and simultaneously\r\nthe shrill cry of an infant in the sudden agony of death carries\r\ndesolation to the ear!\r\n\r\n'Tis done--'twas but the work of a moment; the wolf has swept by, the\r\nquick rustling of his feet is no longer heard in the village. But those\r\nsounds are succeeded by awful wails and heart-rending lamentations: for\r\nthe child--the blooming, violet-eyed, flaxen-haired boy--the darling of\r\nhis poor but tender parents, is weltering in his blood!\r\n\r\nOn, on speeds the destroyer, urged by an infernal influence which\r\nmaddens the more intensely because its victim strives vainly to struggle\r\nagainst it: on, on, over the beaten road--over the fallow field--over\r\nthe cottager's garden--over the grounds of the rich one's rural villa.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to add to the horrors of the scene, a pack of dogs have started\r\nin pursuit of the wolf--dashing--hurrying--pushing--pressing upon one\r\nanother in all the anxious ardor of the chase.\r\n\r\nThe silence and shade of the open country, in the mild starlight, seem\r\neloquently to proclaim the peace and happiness of a rural life; but now\r\nthat silence is broken by the mingled howling of the wolf, and the deep\r\nbaying of the hounds--and this shade is crossed and darkened by the\r\nforms of the animals as they scour so fleetly--oh! with such whirlwind\r\nspeed along.\r\n\r\nBut that Wehr-Wolf bears a charmed life; for though the hounds overtake\r\nhim--fall upon him--and attack him with all the courage of their nature,\r\nyet does he hurl them from him, toss them aside, spurn them away, and at\r\nlength free himself from their pursuit altogether!\r\n\r\nAnd now the moon rises with unclouded splendor, like a maiden looking\r\nfrom her lattice screened with purple curtains; and still the monster\r\nhurries madly on with unrelaxing speed.\r\n\r\nFor hours has he pursued his way thus madly; and, on a sudden, as he\r\npasses the outskirts of a sleeping town, the church-bell is struck by\r\nthe watcher's hand to proclaim midnight.\r\n\r\nOver the town, over the neighboring fields--through the far-off forest,\r\nclanged that iron tongue: and the Wehr-Wolf sped all the faster, as if\r\nhe were running a race with that Time whose voice had just spoken.\r\n\r\nOn, on went the Wehr-Wolf; but now his course began to deviate from the\r\nright line which he had hitherto pursued, and to assume a curved\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFrom a field a poor man was turning an ox into the main road, that he\r\nmight drive the animal to his master's residence by daylight; the wolf\r\nswept by, and snapped furiously at the ox as he passed: and the beast,\r\naffrighted by the sudden appearance, gushing sound, and abrupt though\r\nevanescent attack of the infuriate monster, turned on the herdsman and\r\ngored him to death.\r\n\r\nOn went the terrific wolf, with wilder and more frequent howlings, which\r\nwere answered in a thousand tones from the rocks and caverns overlooking\r\nthe valley through whose bosom he was now careering with whirlwind speed\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nIt was now two o'clock in the morning, and he had already described an\r\nimmense circuit from the point where he had begun to deviate from a\r\ndirect course.\r\n\r\nAt a turning of the road, as he emerged from the valley, the monster\r\nencountered a party of village girls repairing with the produce of their\r\ndairies, and of their poultry-yards, to some still far distant town,\r\nwhich they had hoped to reach shortly after daybreak.\r\n\r\nFair, gay, and smiling was the foremost maiden, as the bright moon and\r\nthe silver starlight shone upon her countenance; but that sweet face,\r\nclad in the richest hues of health, was suddenly convulsed with horror,\r\nas the terrible Wehr-Wolf thundered by with appalling howls.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the foremost village maiden stood rooted to the spot\r\nin speechless horror: then, uttering a wild cry, she fell backward,\r\nrolled down a steep bank, and was ingulfed in the rapid stream that\r\nchafed and fretted along the side of the path.\r\n\r\nHer companions shrieked in agony of mind--the wail was echoed by a\r\ndespairing cry from the drowning girl--a cry that swept frantically over\r\nthe rippling waters; and, in another moment, she sank to rise no more!\r\n\r\nThe breeze had by this time increased to a sharp wind, icy and cold, as\r\nit usually is, even in southern climes, when the dawn is approaching;\r\nand the gale now whistled through the branches of the evergreen wood in\r\nthe neighborhood of Florence--that vicinity to which the Wehr-Wolf was\r\nat length returning!\r\n\r\nStill was his pace of arrow-like velocity--for some terrible power\r\nappeared to urge him on; and though his limbs failed not, though he\r\nstaggered not in his lightning speed, yet did the foam at his mouth, the\r\nthick flakes of perspiration on his body, and the steam that enveloped\r\nhim as in a dense vapor, denote how distressed the unhappy being in\r\nreality was.\r\n\r\nAt last--at last a faint tinge was visible above the eastern horizon;\r\ngradually the light increased and put to flight the stars.\r\n\r\nBut now the Oriental sky was to some extent obscured with clouds; and\r\nthe Wehr-Wolf gnashed his teeth with rage, and uttered a savage howl, as\r\nif impatient of the delay of dawn.\r\n\r\nHis speed began to relax; the infernal influence which had governed him\r\nfor so many hours already grew less stern, less powerful, and as the\r\ntwilight shone forth more plainly in proportion did the Wehr-Wolf's\r\nvelocity diminish.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a piercing chill darted through his frame, and he fell in\r\nstrong convulsions upon the ground, in the midst of the same wood where\r\nhis transformation had taken place on the preceding evening.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose angrily, imparting a lurid, reddened hue to the dark clouds\r\nthat hung upon the Oriental heaven, as if the mantling curtains of a\r\nnight's pavilion strove to repel the wooing kisses of the morn; and the\r\ncold chill breeze made the branches swing to and fro with ominous\r\nflapping, like the wings of the fabulous Simoorg.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of the appalling spasmodic convulsions, with direful\r\nwrithings on the soil, and with cries of bitter anguish, the Wehr-Wolf\r\ngradually threw off his monster-shape; and at the very moment when the\r\nfirst sunbeam penetrated the wood and glinted on his face he rose a\r\nhandsome, young, and perfect man once more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nNISIDA'S EMOTIONS--THE DISGUISE--THE PLOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now return to Nisida, whom we left gazing from the window of the\r\nRiverola mansion, at the moment when Wagner rushed away from the\r\nvicinity of his lady-love on the approach of sunset.\r\n\r\nThe singularity of his conduct--the look of ineffable horror and anguish\r\nwhich he cast upon her, ere he parted from her presence--and the\r\nabruptness of his departure, filled her mind with the most torturing\r\nmisgivings, and with a thousand wild fears.\r\n\r\nHad his senses suddenly left him? was he the prey to fits of mental\r\naberration which would produce so extraordinary an effect upon him? had\r\nhe taken a sudden loathing and disgust to herself? or had he\r\n_discovered_ anything in respect to her which had converted his love\r\ninto hatred?\r\n\r\nShe knew not--and conjecture was vain! To a woman of her excitable\r\ntemperament, the occurrence was particularly painful. She had never\r\nknown the passion of love until she had seen Wagner; and the moment she\r\ndid see him, she loved him. The sentiment on her part originated\r\naltogether in the natural sensuality of her disposition; there was\r\nnothing pure--nothing holy--nothing refined in her affection for him; it\r\nwas his wonderful personal beauty that had made so immediate and\r\nprofound an impression upon her heart.\r\n\r\nThere was consequently something furious and raging in that passion\r\nwhich she experienced for Fernand Wagner--a passion capable of every\r\nextreme--the largest sacrifices, or infuriate jealousies--the most\r\nimplicit confidence, or the maddest suspicion! It was a passion which\r\nwould induce her to ascend the scaffold to save him; or to plunge the\r\nvengeful dagger into his heart did she fancy that he deceived her!\r\n\r\nTo one, then, whose soul was animated by such a love, the conduct of\r\nFernand was well adapted to wear even an exaggerated appearance of\r\nsingularity; and as each different conjecture swept through her\r\nimagination, her emotions were excited to an extent which caused her\r\ncountenance to vary its expressions a hundred times in a minute.\r\n\r\nThe fury of the desolating torrent, the rage of the terrific volcano,\r\nthe sky cradled in the blackest clouds, the ocean heaving tempestuously\r\nin its mighty bed, the chafing of a tremendous flood against an\r\nembankment which seems ready every moment to give way, and allow the\r\ncollected waters to burst forth upon the broad plains and into the\r\npeaceful valleys--all these occurrences in the physical world were\r\nimagined by the emotions that now agitated within the breast of the\r\nItalian lady.\r\n\r\nHer mind was like the sea put in motion by the wind; and her eyes\r\nflashed fire, her lips quivered, her bosom heaved convulsively, her neck\r\narched proudly, as if she were struggling against ideas that forced\r\nthemselves upon her and painfully wounded her boundless patrician pride.\r\n\r\nFor the thought that rose uppermost amidst all the conjectures which\r\nrushed to her imagination, was that Fernand had conceived an invincible\r\ndislike toward her.\r\n\r\nWherefore did he fly thus--as if eager to place the greatest possible\r\ndistance between herself and him?\r\n\r\nThen did she recall to mind every interchange of thought that had passed\r\nbetween them through the language of the fingers; and she could fix upon\r\nnothing which, emanating from herself, had given him offense.\r\n\r\nHad he then really lost his senses?\r\n\r\nMadly did he seem to be rushing toward the Arno, on whose dark tide the\r\ndeparting rays of the setting sun glinted with oscillating and dying\r\npower.\r\n\r\nShe still continued to gaze from the window long after he had\r\ndisappeared; obscurity was gathering rapidly around; but, even had it\r\nbeen noonday, she would have seen nothing. Her ideas grew bewildered:\r\nmortification, grief, anger, suspicion, burning desire, all mingled\r\ntogether and at length produced a species of stunning effect upon her,\r\nso that the past appeared to be a dream, and the future was wrapt in the\r\ndarkest gloom and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThis strange condition of her mind did not, however, last long; the\r\nnatural energy of her character speedily asserted its empire over the\r\nintellectual lethargy which had seized upon her, and, awakening from her\r\nstupor, she resolved to waste not another instant in useless conjecture\r\nas to the cause of her lover's conduct.\r\n\r\nHastening to her own apartments, she dismissed Flora Francatelli, whom\r\nshe found there, with an abruptness of gesture and a frowning expression\r\nof countenance amounting to an act of cruelty toward that resigned and\r\ncharming girl; so that as the latter hastened from the room, tears\r\nstarted from her eyes, and she murmured to herself, \"Can it be possible\r\nthat Donna Nisida suspects the attachment her brother has formed toward\r\nme? Oh! if she do, the star of an evil destiny seems already to rule my\r\nhoroscope!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had Flora disappeared in this sorrowing manner, when Nisida\r\nsecured the outer door of her own suit of apartments, and hurried to her\r\nbed-chamber. There she threw aside the garb belonging to her sex, and\r\nassumed that of a cavalier, which she took from a press opening with a\r\nsecret spring. Then, having arranged her hair beneath a velvet tocque\r\nshaded with waving black plumes, in such a manner that the disguise was\r\nas complete as she could render it, she girt on a long rapier of finest\r\nMilan steel, and throwing the short cloak edged with costly fur,\r\ngracefully over her left shoulder, she quitted her chamber by a private\r\ndoor opening behind the folds of the bed curtains.\r\n\r\nA narrow and dark staircase admitted her into the gardens of the\r\nRiverola mansion. These she crossed with a step so light and free, that\r\nhad it been possible to observe her in the darkness of the evening, she\r\nwould have been taken for the most elegant and charming cavalier that\r\never honored the Florentine Republic with his presence.\r\n\r\nIn about a quarter of an hour she reached the abode of Dr. Duras; but\r\ninstead of entering it, she passed round one of its angles, and opening\r\na wicket by means of a key which she had about her, gained access to the\r\ngardens in the rear of the mansion.\r\n\r\nShe traversed these grounds with hasty steps, passing the boundary which\r\nseparated them from the gardens of Wagner's dwelling, and then relaxing\r\nher pace, advanced with more caution to the windows of this very\r\napartment where Agnes had been so alarmed two months previously, by\r\nobserving the countenance at the casement.\r\n\r\nBut all was now dark within. Wagner was not in his favorite room--for\r\nNisida _knew_ that this was her lover's favorite apartment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had not yet returned?\r\n\r\nThus thought the lady; and she walked slowly round the spacious\r\ndwelling, which, like the generality of the patrician mansions of\r\nFlorence in those times--as indeed is now the case to a considerable\r\nextent--stood in the midst of extensive gardens.\r\n\r\nThere were lights in the servants' offices; but every other room seemed\r\ndark. No; one window in the front, on the ground-floor, shone with the\r\nluster of a lamp.\r\n\r\nNisida approached it, and beheld Agnes reclining in a pensive manner on\r\na sofa in a small but elegantly-furnished apartment. Her countenance was\r\nimmediately overclouded; and for an instant she lingered to gaze upon\r\nthe sylph-like form that was stretched upon that ottoman. Then she\r\nhastily pursued her way; and, having perfected the round of the\r\nbuilding, once more reached the windows of her lover's favorite room.\r\n\r\nConvinced that he had not returned, and fearful of being observed by any\r\nof the domestics who might happen to pass through the gardens, Nisida\r\nretraced her way toward the dwelling of Dr. Duras. But her heart was now\r\nheavy, for she knew not how to act.\r\n\r\nHer original object was to obtain an interview with Wagner that very\r\nnight, and learn, if possible, the reason of his extraordinary conduct\r\ntoward her: for the idea of remaining in suspense for many long, long\r\nhours, was painful in the extreme to a woman of her excitable nature.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, compelled to resign herself to this alternative; and,\r\nhaving let herself through the wicket belonging to the physician's\r\ngardens, she directed her steps homeward.\r\n\r\nOn her way she passed by the gate of the Convent of Carmelite Nuns--one\r\nof the wealthiest, most strictly disciplined, and celebrated monastic\r\nestablishments in the Florentine Republic.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that a sudden thought here struck her; for ascending to the\r\nsteep leading to the gate, she paused beneath the lamp of the deep\r\nGothic portico, took out her tablets, and hastily wrote the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Donna Nisida of Riverola requests an interview with the Lady Abbess\r\nMaria to-morrow at midday, on a matter seriously regarding the spiritual\r\nwelfare of a young female who has shown great and signal disregard for\r\nthe rites and ordinances of the most Holy Catholic Church: and in\r\nrespect to whom the most severe measures must be adopted. Donna Nisida\r\nwill visit the holy mother to-morrow at midday.\"\r\n\r\nHaving written these words, Nisida tore off the leaf and thrust it\r\nthrough a small square grating set in the massive door of the convent.\r\nThen ringing the bell to call attention to the gate, she hastily pursued\r\nher way homeward.\r\n\r\nShe had gained the gardens of the Riverola mansion, and was advancing\r\ntoward the door of the private staircase leading to her chamber, when\r\nshe suddenly perceived two dark figures standing within a few yards of\r\nher. Fearful that they might be domestics belonging to the household,\r\nshe hastily and noiselessly retreated within the deep shade of the wall\r\nof the mansion, and there she remained motionless.\r\n\r\nWe must now detail the conversation which passed between the two\r\nindividuals whose presence in the garden had thus alarmed the Lady\r\nNisida.\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure of what you say, Antonio?\" demanded one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"By Saint Jacopo! I cannot be mistaken,\" was the reply. \"The closet has\r\nbeen locked up for years and years, and the old count always used to\r\nkeep the keys in an iron chest, which was also carefully locked and\r\nchained round. What can the place possibly contain but a treasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"After all it is only conjecture on your part; and that being the case,\r\nit is not worth while to risk one's life----\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a coward, Stephano!\" exclaimed Antonio, angrily. \"The closet\r\nhas got a heavy, massive door, and a prodigiously strong lock; and if\r\nthese precautions were not adopted to protect a hoard of wealth, why\r\nwere they taken at all, let me ask you?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something in what you say,\" replied Stephano; \"but you do\r\nwrong to call me a coward. If it were not that we were cousins, and\r\nlinked by a bond of long maintained friendship, I would send my rapier\r\nthrough your doublet in a twinkling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay; I do not mean to anger thee, Stephano,\" cried the valet. \"But let\r\nus speak lower: chafe not, I pray thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--well!\" said the other, gloomily; \"go on, in the name of your\r\npatron saint! Only keep a guard upon your tongue, for it wags somewhat\r\ntoo freely; and remember that a man who has been for fifteen years the\r\ncaptain of as gallant a band as ever levied contributions on the lieges\r\nof the republic, is not to have '_coward_' thrown in his teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it pass, good Stephano!\" urged the valet. \"I tell thee that a\r\ncloset whereof I have spoken, can contain naught save a\r\ntreasure--perhaps in gold--perhaps in massive plate.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can dispose of either to our advantage,\" observed the bandit, with a\r\ncoarse chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"Will you undertake the business?\" demanded Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" was the resolute answer; \"and as much to convince you that\r\nStephano is not a coward, as for any other reason. But when is it to be\r\ndone? and why did you make an appointment to meet me here, of all places\r\nin Florence?\"\r\n\r\n\"It can be done when you choose,\" replied Antonio; \"and as for the other\r\nquestions, I desired you to meet me here, because I knew that you would\r\nnot refuse a fine chance; and, suspecting this much it was necessary to\r\nshow you the geography of the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" observed the robber-chief. \"To-morrow night I have a little\r\naffair in hand for a reverend and holy father, who is sure to be chosen\r\nsuperior of his order if his rival in the candidature be removed; and in\r\nfour-and-twenty hours the said rival must be food for the fishes of the\r\nArno.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the night after that?\" suggested Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"Pre-engaged again,\" returned the bandit-captain coolly. \"A wealthy\r\ncountess has been compelled to pledge her diamonds to a Jew; on Sunday\r\nnext she must appear with her husband at the palace of the Medici; and\r\non Saturday night, therefore, the diamonds must be recovered from the\r\nJew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the husband knows not that they are so pledged?\" said Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely,\" answered the brigand. \"They were deposited with the Jew for\r\na loan which the countess raised to accommodate her lover. Now do you\r\nunderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly. What say you to next Monday night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at your service,\" responded Stephano. \"Monday will suit me\r\nadmirably, and midnight shall be the hour. And now instruct me in the\r\nnature of the locality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come with me, and I will show you by which way you and your comrades\r\nmust effect an entry,\" said Antonio.\r\n\r\nThe valet and the robber-chief now moved away from the spot where they\r\nhad stood to hold the above conversation; and the moment they had turned\r\nthe adjacent angle of the mansion, Nisida hastened to regain her\r\napartment by the private staircase--resolving, however, to see Wagner as\r\nearly as possible in the morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST MEETING OF AGNES AND THE STRANGER LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile all nature was wrapped in the listening stillness of admiration at\r\nthe rising sun, Fernand Wagner dragged himself painfully toward his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHis garments were besmeared with mud and dirt; they were torn, too, in\r\nmany places; and here and there were stains of blood, still wet, upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn fact, had he been dragged by a wild horse through a thicket of\r\nbrambles, he could scarcely have appeared in a more wretched plight.\r\n\r\nHis countenance was ghastly pale; terror still flashed from his eyes,\r\nand despair sat on his lofty brow.\r\n\r\nStealing through the most concealed part of his garden, he was\r\napproaching his own mansion with the air of a man who returns home in\r\nthe morning after having perpetrated some dreadful deed of turpitude\r\nunder cover of the night.\r\n\r\nBut the watchful eyes of a woman have marked his coming from the lattice\r\nof her window; and in a few minutes Agnes, light as a fawn, came\r\nbounding toward him, exclaiming, \"Oh! what a night of uneasiness have I\r\npassed, Fernand! But at length thou art restored to me--thou whom I have\r\never loved so fondly; although,\" she added, mournfully, \"I abandoned\r\nthee for so long a time!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she embraced him tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"Agnes!\" cried Fernand, repulsing her with an impatience which she had\r\nnever experienced at his hands before: \"wherefore thus act the spy upon\r\nme? Believe me, that although we pass ourselves off as brother and\r\nsister, yet I do not renounce that authority which the real nature of\r\nthose ties that bind us together----\"\r\n\r\n\"Fernand! Fernand! this to me!\" exclaimed Agnes, bursting into tears.\r\n\"Oh! how have I deserved such reproaches?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dearest girl, pardon me, forgive me!\" cried Wagner, in a tone of\r\nbitter anguish. \"My God! I ought not to upbraid thee for that\r\nwatchfulness during my absence, and that joy at my return, which prove\r\nthat you love me! Again I say, pardon me, dearest Agnes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not ask me, Fernand,\" was the reply. \"Only speak kindly to\r\nme----\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, I will, Agnes,\" interrupted Wagner. \"But leave me now! Let me\r\nregain my own chamber alone; I have reasons, urgent reasons for so\r\ndoing; and this afternoon, Agnes, I shall be composed--collected again.\r\nDo you proceed by that path; I will take this.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, hastily pressing her hand, Wagner broke abruptly away.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Agnes stood looking after him in vacant astonishment\r\nat his extraordinary manner, and also at his alarming appearance, but\r\nconcerning which latter she had not dared to question him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had entered the mansion by a private door, Agnes turned and\r\npursued her way along a circuitous path shaded on each side by dark\r\nevergreens, and which was the one he had directed her to take so as to\r\nregain the front gate of the dwelling.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had she advanced a dozen paces, when a sudden rustling\r\namong the trees alarmed her; and in an instant a female form--tall,\r\nmajestic, and with a dark veil thrown over her head, stood before her.\r\n\r\nAgnes uttered a faint shriek: for, although the lady's countenance was\r\nconcealed by the veil, she had no difficulty in recognizing the stranger\r\nwho had already terrified her on three previous occasions, and who\r\nseemed to haunt her.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if to dispel all doubt as to the identity, the majestic lady\r\nsuddenly tore aside her veil, and disclosed to the trembling, shrinking\r\nAgnes, features already too well known.\r\n\r\nBut, if the lightning of those brilliant, burning, black eyes had seemed\r\nterrible on former occasions, they were now absolutely blasting, and\r\nAgnes fell upon her knees, exclaiming, \"Mercy! mercy! how have I\r\noffended you?\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments those basilisk-eyes darted forth shafts of fire and\r\nflame, and the red lips quivered violently, and the haughty brow\r\ncontracted menacingly, and Agnes was stupefied, stunned, fascinated,\r\nterribly fascinated by that tremendous rage, the vengeance of which\r\nseemed ready to explode against her.\r\n\r\nBut only a few moments lasted that dreadful scene; for the lady, whose\r\nentire appearance was that of an avenging fiend in the guise of a\r\nbeauteous woman, suddenly drew a sharp poniard from its sheath in her\r\nbodice, and plunged it into the bosom of the hapless Agnes.\r\n\r\nThe victim fell back; but not a shriek--not a sound escaped her lips.\r\nThe blow was well aimed, the poniard was sharp and went deep, and death\r\nfollowed instantaneously.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a minute did the murderess stand gazing on the corpse--the\r\ncorpse of one erst so beautiful; and her countenance, gradually relaxing\r\nfrom its stern, implacable expression, assumed an air of deep\r\nremorse--of bitter, bitter compunction.\r\n\r\nBut probably yielding to the sudden thought that she must provide for\r\nher own safety, the murderess drew forth the dagger from the white bosom\r\nin which it was buried: hastily wiped it upon a leaf; returned it to the\r\nsheath; and, replacing the veil over her countenance, hurried rapidly\r\naway from the scene of her fearful crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE SBIRRI--THE ARREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely ten minutes had elapsed since the unfortunate Agnes was thus\r\nsuddenly cut off in the bloom of youth and beauty, when a lieutenant of\r\npolice, with his guard of sbirri, passed along the road skirting\r\nWagner's garden.\r\n\r\nThey were evidently in search of some malefactor, for, stopping in their\r\ncourse, they began to deliberate on the business which they had in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Which way could he possibly have gone?\" cried one, striking the\r\nbutt-end of his pike heavily upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"How could we possibly have missed him?\" exclaimed another.\r\n\r\n\"Stephano is not so easily caught, my men,\" observed the lieutenant. \"He\r\nis the most astute and cunning of the band of which he is the captain.\r\nAnd yet, I wish we had pounced upon him, since we were so nicely upon\r\nhis track.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a thousand ducats offered by the state for his capture,\" suggested\r\none of the sbirri.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; 'tis annoying!\" ejaculated the lieutenant, \"but I could have sworn\r\nhe passed this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I could bear the same evidence, signor,\" observed the first\r\nspeaker. \"Maybe he has taken refuge in those bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unlikely. We are fools to grant him a moment's vantage ground. Over\r\nthe fence, my men, and beat amongst these gardens.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, the lieutenant set the example, by leaping the railing,\r\nand entering the grounds belonging to Wagner's abode.\r\n\r\nThe sbirri, who were six in number, including their officer, divided\r\nthemselves into two parties, and proceeded to search the gardens.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud cry of horror burst from one of the sections; and when\r\nthe other hastened to the spot, the sbirri composing it found their\r\ncomrades in the act of raising the corpse of Agnes.\r\n\r\n\"She is quite dead,\" said the lieutenant, placing his hand upon her\r\nheart. \"And yet the crime cannot have been committed many minutes, as\r\nthe corpse is scarcely cold, and the blood still oozes forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely creature she must have been,\" exclaimed one of the\r\nsbirri.\r\n\r\n\"Cease your profane remarks, my man,\" cried the lieutenant. \"This must\r\nbe examined into directly. Does any one know who dwells in that\r\nmansion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor Wagner, a wealthy German,\" was the reply given by a sbirro.\r\n\r\n\"Then come with me, my man,\" said the lieutenant; \"and let us lose no\r\ntime in searching his house. One of you must remain by the corpse--and\r\nthe rest may continue the search after the bandit, Stephano.\"\r\n\r\nHaving issued these orders, the lieutenant, followed by the sbirro whom\r\nhe had chosen to accompany him, hastened to the mansion.\r\n\r\nThe gate was opened by an old porter, who stared in astonishment when he\r\nbeheld the functionaries of justice visiting that peaceful dwelling. But\r\nthe lieutenant ordered him to close and lock the gate; and having\r\nsecured the key, the officer said, \"We must search this house; a crime\r\nhas been committed close at hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"A crime!\" ejaculated the porter; \"then the culprit is not here--for\r\nthere is not a soul beneath this roof who would perpetrate a misdeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cease your prating, old man,\" said the lieutenant, sternly. \"We have a\r\nduty to perform--see that we be not molested in executing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the crime, signor, of which----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay--that you shall know anon,\" interrupted the lieutenant. \"In the\r\nname of his serene highness, the duke, I command you in the first place\r\nto lead me and my followers to the presence of your master.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man hastened to obey this mandate, and he conducted the sbirri\r\ninto the chamber where Wagner, having thrown off his garments, was\r\npartaking of that rest which he so much needed.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of heavy feet and the clanking of martial weapons, Fernand\r\nstarted from the slumber into which he had fallen only a few minutes\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\n\"What means this insolent intrusion?\" he exclaimed, his cheeks flushing\r\nwith anger at the presence of the police.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon us, signor,\" said the lieutenant, in a respectful tone: \"but a\r\ndreadful crime has been committed close by--indeed within the inclosure\r\nof your own grounds----\"\r\n\r\n\"A dreadful crime!\" ejaculated Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, signor; a crime----\"\r\n\r\nThe officer was interrupted by an ejaculation of surprise which burst\r\nfrom the lips of his attendant sbirro; and, turning hastily round, he\r\nbeheld his follower intently scrutinizing the attire which Fernand had\r\nere now thrown off.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! blood-stains!\" cried the lieutenant, whose attention was directed\r\ntoward those marks by the finger of his man. \"Then is the guilty one\r\nspeedily discovered! Signor!\" he added, turning once more toward Wagner,\r\n\"are those your garments?\"\r\n\r\nAn expression of indescribable horror convulsed the countenance of\r\nFernand; for the question of the officer naturally reminded him of his\r\ndreadful fate--the fate of a Wehr-Wolf--although, we should observe, he\r\nnever remembered, when restored to the form of a man, what he might have\r\ndone during the long hours that he wore the shape of a ferocious\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\nStill, as he knew that his garments had been soiled, torn and\r\nblood-stained in the course of the preceding night, it was no wonder\r\nthat he shuddered and became convulsed with mental agony when his\r\nterrible doom was so forcibly called to his mind.\r\n\r\nHis emotions were naturally considered to be corroborative evidence of\r\nguilt: and the lieutenant laying his hand upon Wagner's shoulder, said\r\nin a stern, solemn manner, \"In the name of his highness our prince, I\r\narrest you for the crime of murder!\"\r\n\r\n\"Murder!\" repeated Fernand, dashing away the officer's arm; \"you dare\r\nnot accuse me of such a deed!\"\r\n\r\n\"I accuse you of murder, signor,\" exclaimed the lieutenant. \"Within a\r\nhundred paces of your dwelling a young lady----\"\r\n\r\n\"A young lady!\" cried Wagner, thinking of Agnes, whom he had left in the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, signor, a young lady has been most barbarously murdered!\" added\r\nthe officer in an impressive tone.\r\n\r\n\"Agnes! Agnes!\" almost screamed the unhappy man, as this dreadful\r\nannouncement fell upon his ears. \"Oh! is it possible that thou art no\r\nmore, my poor Agnes!\"\r\n\r\nHe covered his face with his hands and wept bitterly.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant made a sign to his follower, who instantly quitted the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"There must be some mistake in this, signor,\" said the old porter,\r\napproaching the lieutenant and speaking in a voice tremulous with\r\nemotion. \"The master whom I serve, and whom you accuse, is incapable of\r\nthe deed imputed to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. God knows how truly you speak!\" ejaculated Wagner, raising his\r\nhead. \"That girl--oh! sooner than have harmed one single hair of her\r\nhead---- But how know you that it is Agnes who is murdered?\" he cried\r\nabruptly, turning toward the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"It was you who said it, signor,\" calmly replied the officer, as he\r\nfixed his dark eyes keenly upon Fernand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! it was a surmise--a conjecture--because I parted with Agnes a short\r\ntime ago in the garden,\" exclaimed Wagner, speaking in hurried and\r\nbroken sentences.\r\n\r\n\"Behold the victim!\" said the lieutenant, who had approached the window,\r\nfrom which he was looking.\r\n\r\nWagner sprung from his couch, and glanced forth into the garden beneath.\r\n\r\nThe sbirri were advancing along the gravel pathway, bearing amongst them\r\nthe corpse of Agnes upon whose pallid countenance the morning sunbeams\r\nwere dancing, as if in mockery even at death.\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin! it is indeed Agnes!\" cried Wagner, in a tone of the most\r\nprofound heart-rending anguish, and he fell back senseless in the arms\r\nof the lieutenant.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterward, Fernand Wagner was the inmate of a dungeon beneath\r\nthe palace inhabited by the Duke of Florence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nNISIDA AND THE CARMELITE ABBESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctually at midday, the Lady Nisida of Riverola proceeded, alone and\r\nunattended, to the Convent of Carmelite Nuns, where she was immediately\r\nadmitted into the presence of the abbess.\r\n\r\nThe superior of this monastic establishment, was a tall, thin,\r\nstern-looking woman, with a sallow complexion, an imperious compression\r\nof the lips, and small, grey eyes, that seemed to flicker with malignity\r\nrather than to beam with the pure light of Christian love.\r\n\r\nShe was noted for the austerity of her manners, the rigid discipline\r\nwhich she maintained in the convent, and the inexorable disposition\r\nwhich she showed toward those who, having committed a fault, came within\r\nher jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nRumor was often busy with the affairs of the Carmelite Convent; and the\r\ngrandams and gossips of Florence would huddle together around their\r\ndomestic hearths, on the cold winter's evenings, and venture mysterious\r\nhints and whispers of strange deeds committed within the walls of that\r\nsacred institution; how from time to time some young and beautiful nun\r\nhad suddenly disappeared, to the surprise and alarm of her companions;\r\nhow piercing shrieks had been heard to issue from the interior of the\r\nbuilding, by those who passed near it at night,--and how the inmates\r\nthemselves were often aroused from their slumbers by strange noises\r\nresembling the rattling of chains, the working of ponderous machinery,\r\nand the revolution of huge wheels.\r\n\r\nSuch food for scandal as those mysterious whispers supplied, was not\r\nlikely to pass without exaggeration; and that love of the marvelous\r\nwhich inspired the aforesaid gossips, led to the embellishment of the\r\nrumors just glanced at--so that one declared with a solemn shake of the\r\nhead, how spirits were seen to glide around the convent walls at\r\nnight--and another averred that a nun, with whom she was acquainted, had\r\nassured her that strange and unearthly forms were often encountered by\r\nthose inmates of the establishment who were hardy enough to venture into\r\nthe chapel, or to traverse the long corridors or gloomy cloisters after\r\ndusk.\r\n\r\nThese vague and uncertain reports did not, however, prevent some of the\r\nwealthiest families in Florence from placing their daughters in the\r\nCarmelite Convent. A nobleman or opulent citizen who had several\r\ndaughters, would consider it a duty to devote one of them to the service\r\nof the church; and the votive girl was most probably compelled to\r\nperform her novitiate and take the veil in this renowned establishment.\r\nIt was essentially the convent patronized by the aristocracy; and no\r\nfemale would be received within its walls save on the payment of a\r\nconsiderable sum of money.\r\n\r\nThere was another circumstance which added to the celebrity and\r\naugmented the wealth of the Carmelite Convent. Did a young unmarried\r\nlady deviate from the path of virtue, or did a husband detect the\r\ninfidelity of his wife, the culprit was forthwith consigned to the care\r\nof the abbess, and forced to take up her abode in that monastic\r\ninstitution. Or, again--did some female openly neglect her religious\r\nduties, or imprudently express an opinion antagonistic to the Roman\r\nCatholic Church, the family to which she belonged would remove her to\r\nthe spiritual care of the abbess.\r\n\r\nThe convent was therefore considered to be an institution recognized by\r\nthe state as a means of punishing immorality, upholding the Catholic\r\nreligion, persuading the skeptical,--confirming the wavering, and\r\nexercising a salutary terror over the ladies of the upper class, at that\r\nperiod renowned for their dissolute morals. The aristocracy of Florence\r\npatronized and protected the institution--because its existence afforded\r\na ready means to get rid of a dishonored daughter, or an unfaithful\r\nwife; and it was even said that the abbess was invested with\r\nextraordinary powers by the rescript of the duke himself, powers which\r\nwarranted her interference with the liberty of young females who were\r\ndenounced to her by their parents, guardians, or others who might have a\r\nsemblance of a right to control or coerce them.\r\n\r\nLuther had already begun to make a noise in Germany; and the thunders of\r\nhis eloquence had reverberated across the Alps to the Italian states.\r\nThe priesthood was alarmed; and the conduct of the reformer was an\r\nexcuse for rendering the discipline of the monastic institutions more\r\nrigid than ever. Nor was the Abbess Maria a woman who hesitated to avail\r\nherself of this fact as an apology for strengthening her despotism and\r\nwidening the circle of her influence.\r\n\r\nThe reader has now heard enough to make him fully aware that the Carmelite\r\nConvent was an establishment enjoying influence, exercising an authority,\r\nand wielding a power, which--if these were misdirected--constituted an\r\nenormous abuse in the midst of states bearing the name of a republic.\r\nBut the career of the Medici was then hastening toward a close; and in\r\nproportion as the authority of the duke became more circumscribed, the\r\nencroachments of the ecclesiastical orders grew more extensive.\r\n\r\nThe Abbess Maria, who was far advanced in years, but was endowed with\r\none of those vigorous intellects against which Time vainly directs his\r\ninfluence, received the Lady Nisida in a little parlor plainly\r\nfurnished. The praying desk was of the most humble description; and\r\nabove it rose a cross of wood so worm-eaten and decayed that it seemed\r\nas if the grasp of a strong hand would crush it into dust. But this\r\nemblem of the creed had been preserved in the Carmelite Convent since\r\nthe period of the Second Crusade, and was reported to consist of a piece\r\nof the actual cross on which the Saviour suffered in Palestine.\r\n\r\nAgainst the wall hung a scourge, with five knotted thongs, whereon the\r\nblood-stains denoted the severity of that penance which the abbess\r\nfrequently inflicted upon herself. On a table stood a small loaf of\r\ncoarse bread and a pitcher of water; for although a sumptuous banquet\r\nwas every day served up in the refectory, the abbess was never known to\r\npartake of the delicious viands nor to place her lips in contact with\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nWhen Nisida entered the presence of the abbess, she sank on her knees,\r\nand folded her arms meekly across her bosom. The holy mother gave her a\r\nblessing, and made a motion for her to rise. Nisida obeyed, and took a\r\nseat near the abbess at the table.\r\n\r\nShe then drew forth her tablets, and wrote a few lines, which the\r\nsuperior read with deep attention.\r\n\r\nNisida placed a heavy purse of gold upon the table, and the abbess\r\nnodded an assent to the request contained in the lines inscribed on the\r\ntablet.\r\n\r\nThe interview was about to terminate, when the door suddenly opened, and\r\nan elderly nun entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Ursula,\" said the lady abbess, in a cold but reproachful tone, \"didst\r\nthou not know that I was engaged? What means this abrupt intrusion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, holy mother!\" exclaimed the nun: \"but the rumor of such a\r\nfrightful murder has just reached us----\"\r\n\r\n\"A murder!\" ejaculated the abbess. \"Oh! unhappy Florence, when wilt thou\r\nsay farewell to crimes which render thy name detestable among Italian\r\nstates?\"\r\n\r\n\"This indeed, too, holy mother, is one of inordinate blackness,\"\r\ncontinued Sister Ursula. \"A young and beautiful lady----\"\r\n\r\n\"We know not personal beauty within these walls, daughter,\" interrupted\r\nthe abbess, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"True, holy mother! and yet I did but repeat the tale as the porteress\r\nere now related it to me. However,\" resumed Ursula, \"it appears that a\r\nyoung female, whom the worldly-minded outside these sacred walls\r\ndenominate beautiful, was barbarously murdered this morning--shortly\r\nafter the hour of sunrise----\"\r\n\r\n\"Within the precincts of Florence?\" inquired the abbess.\r\n\r\n\"Within a short distance of the convent, holy mother,\" answered the nun.\r\n\"The dreadful deed was accomplished in the garden attached to the\r\nmansion of a certain Signor Wagner, whom the worldly-minded style a\r\nyoung man wondrously handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fair exterior often conceals a dark heart, daughter,\" said the\r\nabbess. \"But who was the hapless victim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rumor declares, holy mother----\"\r\n\r\nThe nun checked herself abruptly, and glanced at Nisida, who, during the\r\nabove conversation, had approached the windows which commanded a view of\r\nthe convent garden, and whose back was therefore turned toward the\r\nabbess and Ursula.\r\n\r\n\"You may speak fearlessly, daughter,\" said the abbess; \"that unfortunate\r\nlady hears you not--for she is both deaf and dumb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin succor her,\" exclaimed Ursula, crossing herself. \"I was\r\nabout to inform your ladyship,\" she continued, \"that rumor represents\r\nthe murdered woman to have been the sister of this Signor Wagner of whom\r\nI spoke; but it is more than probable that there was no tie of\r\nrelationship between them--and that----\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand you, daughter,\" interrupted the abbess. \"Alas! how much\r\nwickedness is engendered in this world by the sensual, fleshly passion\r\nwhich mortals denominate love! But is the murderer detected?\"\r\n\r\n\"The murderer was arrested immediately after the perpetration of the\r\ncrime,\" responded Ursula; \"and at this moment he is a prisoner in the\r\ndungeon of the palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the lost man that has perpetrated such a dreadful crime?\"\r\ndemanded the abbess, again crossing herself.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Wagner himself, holy mother,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"The pious Duke Cosmo bequeathed gold to this institution,\" said the\r\nabbess, \"that masses might be offered up for the souls of those who fall\r\nbeneath the weapon of the assassin. See that the lamented prince's\r\ninstructions be not neglected in this instance, Ursula.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to remind your ladyship of this duty that I ventured to break\r\nupon your privacy,\" returned the nun, who then withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe abbess approached Nisida, and touched her upon the shoulder to\r\nintimate to her that they were again alone together.\r\n\r\nShe had drawn down her veil, and was leaning her forehead against one of\r\nthe iron bars which protected the window--apparently in a mood of deep\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nWhen the abbess touched her, she started abruptly round--then, pressing\r\nthe superior's hand with convulsive violence, hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nThe old porteress presented the alms-box as she opened the gate of the\r\nconvent; but Nisida pushed it rudely aside, and hurried down the steps\r\nas if she were escaping from a lazar-house, rather than issuing from a\r\nmonastic institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nWAGNER IN PRISON--A VISITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evening; and Wagner paced his narrow dungeon with agitated steps.\r\n\r\nFar beneath the level of the ground, and under the ducal palace, was\r\nthat gloomy prison, having no window, save a grating in the massive door\r\nto admit the air.\r\n\r\nA lamp burned dimly upon the table, whereon stood also the coarse prison\r\nfare provided for the captive, but which was untouched.\r\n\r\nThe clanking of the weapons of the sentinels, who kept guard in the\r\npassage from which the various dungeons opened, fell mournfully upon\r\nFernand's ears, and every moment reminded him of the apparent\r\nimpossibility to escape--even if such an idea possessed him.\r\n\r\nThe lamp had burned throughout the day in his dungeon; for the light of\r\nheaven could not penetrate that horrible subterranean cell--and it was\r\nonly by the payment of gold that he had induced the jailer to permit him\r\nthe indulgence of the artificial substitute for the rays of the glorious\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! wretched being that I am!\" he thought within himself, as he paced\r\nthe stone floor of his prison-house; \"the destiny of the accursed is\r\nmine! Ah! fool--dotard that I was to exchange the honors of old age for\r\nthe vicissitudes of a renewed existence! Had nature taken her course, I\r\nshould probably now be sleeping in a quiet grave--and my soul might be\r\nin the regions of the blessed. But the tempter came, and dazzled me with\r\nprospects of endless happiness--and I succumbed! Oh! Faust! would that\r\nthou hadst never crossed the threshold of my humble cottage in the Black\r\nForest! How much sorrow--how much misery should I have been spared!\r\nBetter--better to have remained in poverty--solitude--helplessness--worn\r\ndown by the weight of years--and crushed by the sense of utter\r\nloneliness--oh! better to have endured all this, than to have taken on\r\nmyself a new tenure of that existence which is so marked with misery and\r\nwoe!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself upon a seat, and endeavored to reflect on his position\r\nwith calmness; but he could not!\r\n\r\nStarting up, he again paced the dungeon in an agitated manner.\r\n\r\n\"Holy God!\" he exclaimed aloud, \"how much wretchedness has fallen upon\r\nme in a single day! Agnes murdered--Nisida perhaps forever estranged\r\nfrom me--myself accused of a dreadful crime, whereof I am innocent--and\r\ncircumstances all combining so wonderfully against me! But who could\r\nhave perpetrated the appalling deed? Can that mysterious lady, whom\r\nAgnes spoke of so frequently, and who, by her description, so closely\r\nresembled my much-loved Nisida--can she----\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the bolts were suddenly drawn back from the door of the\r\ndungeon--the clanking chains fell heavily on the stone pavement\r\noutside--and the jailer appeared, holding a lamp in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother, signor, is come to visit you,\" said the turnkey. \"But\r\npray let the interview be a brief one--for it is as much as my situation\r\nand my own liberty are worth to have admitted him without an order from\r\nthe chief judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"With these words the jailer made way for a cavalier to enter the\r\ndungeon;\" and as he closed the door, he said, \"I shall return shortly to\r\nlet your brother out again.\"\r\n\r\nSurprise had hitherto placed a seal upon Wagner's lips; but even before\r\nthe visitor had entered the cell, a faint suspicion--a wild hope had\r\nflashed to his mind that Nisida had not forgotten him, that she would\r\nnot abandon him.\r\n\r\nBut this hope was destroyed almost as soon as formed, by the sudden\r\nrecollection of her affliction;--for how could a deaf and dumb woman\r\nsucceed in bribing and deceiving one so cautious and wary as the jailer\r\nof a criminal prison?\r\n\r\nNevertheless the moment the visitor had entered the cell--and in spite\r\nof the deep disguise which she wore, the eyes of the lover failed not to\r\nrecognize the object of his adoration in that elegant cavalier who now\r\nstood before him.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the jailer closed and bolted the massive door again, when\r\nFernand rushed forward to clasp Nisida in his arms;--but, imperiously\r\nwaving her hand, she motioned him to stand back.\r\n\r\nThen, with the language of the fingers, she rapidly demanded--\"Will you\r\nswear upon the cross that the young female who has been murdered, was\r\nnot your mistress?\"\r\n\r\n\"I swear,\" answered Fernand in the same symbolic manner; and, as the\r\nlight of the lamp played on his handsome countenance, his features\r\nassumed so decided an expression of truth, frankness, and sincerity,\r\nthat Nisida was already more than half convinced of the injustice of her\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nBut still she was determined to be completely satisfied; and, drawing\r\nforth a small but exquisitely sculptured crucifix from her doublet, she\r\npresented it to her lover.\r\n\r\nHe sank upon one knee, received it respectfully, and kissed it without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nNisida then threw herself into his arms, and embraced him with a\r\nfondness as warm, as wild, as impassioned as her suspicions had ere now\r\nbeen vehement and fearfully resentful.\r\n\r\nHer presence caused Fernand to forget his sorrow--to forget that he was\r\nin a dungeon--to forget, also, the tremendous charge that hung over his\r\nhead. For never had his Nisida appeared to him so marvelously beautiful\r\nas he now beheld her, disguised in the graceful garb of a cavalier of\r\nthat age. Though tall, majestic, and of rich proportions for a woman,\r\nyet in the attire of the opposite sex she seemed slight, short, and\r\neminently graceful. The velvet cloak sat so jauntily on her sloping\r\nshoulder;--the doublet became her symmetry so well;--and the rich lace\r\ncollar was so arranged as to disguise the prominence of the chest--that\r\nvoluptuous fullness which could not be compressed.\r\n\r\nAt length a sudden thought struck Fernand, and he inquired, in the usual\r\nmanner, how Nisida had gained access to him?\r\n\r\n\"A faithful friend contrived the interview for me,\" she replied, with\r\nher wonted rapidity of play upon the fingers. \"He led the jailer to\r\nbelieve that I was a German, and totally unacquainted with the Italian\r\ntongue. Thus not a word was addressed to me; and gold has opened the\r\ndoor which separated me from you. The same means shall secure your\r\nescape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest Nisida,\" signaled Wagner, \"I would not escape were the door of\r\nmy dungeon left open and the sentinels removed. I am innocent--and that\r\ninnocence must be proved!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady exhibited extraordinary impatience at this reply.\r\n\r\n\"You do not believe me guilty?\" asked Wagner.\r\n\r\nShe shook her head in a determined manner, to show how profound was her\r\nconviction of his innocence.\r\n\r\n\"Then do not urge me, beloved one, to escape and be dishonored forever,\"\r\nwas the urgent prayer he conveyed to her.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence against you will be overwhelming,\" she gave him to\r\nunderstand: then with an air of the most heart appealing supplication,\r\nshe added, \"Escape, dearest Fernand, for my sake!\"\r\n\r\n\"But I should be compelled to fly from Florence--and wouldst thou\r\naccompany me?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will remain here--in this dungeon! If my innocence be proved, I\r\nmay yet hope to call the sister of the Count of Riverola my wife: if I\r\nbe condemned----\"\r\n\r\nHe paused:--for he knew that, even if he were sentenced to death, he\r\ncould not die,--that some power, of which, however, he had only a vague\r\nnotion, would rescue him,--that the compact, which gave him renewed\r\nyouth and a long life on the fatal condition of his periodical\r\ntransformation into a horrid monster, must be fulfilled; and, though he\r\nsaw not--understood not how all this was to be, still he knew that it\r\n_would_ happen if he should really be condemned!\r\n\r\nNisida was not aware of the motive which had checked her lover as he was\r\nconveying to her his sense of the dread alternatives before him; and she\r\nhastened to intimate to him the following thought:--\r\n\r\n\"You would say that if you be condemned, you will know how to meet death\r\nas becomes a brave man. But think of _me_--of Nisida, who loves you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you continue to love a man branded as a murderer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should only think of you as my own dear Fernand!\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head--as much as to say, \"It cannot be!\"--and then once\r\nmore embraced her fondly--for he beheld, in her anxiety for his escape,\r\nonly a proof of her ardent affection.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the jailer returned: and while he was unbolting the door,\r\nNisida made one last, imploring appeal to her lover to give his assent\r\nto escape, if the arrangements were made for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBut he conveyed to her his resolute determination to meet the charge,\r\nwith the hope of proving his innocence: and for a few moments Nisida\r\nseemed convulsed with the most intense anguish of soul.\r\n\r\nThe jailer made his appearance; and Wagner, to maintain the deceit which\r\nNisida informed him to have been practiced on the man, said a few words\r\naloud in German--as if he was really taking leave of a brother.\r\n\r\nNisida embraced him tenderly; and covering her countenance, as much as\r\npossible, with her slouched hat, the waving plumes of which she made to\r\nfall over her face, this extraordinary being issued from the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nFLORA FRANCATELLI--THE THREE NUNS--THE CHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nNisida regained her apartment, by the private staircase, without any\r\nmolestation. Having laid aside her male attire, she assumed a loose\r\nwrapper, and then, throwing herself into an armchair, gave way to her\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nThese were apparently of no pleasurable nature; for they were frequently\r\ninterrupted by convulsive starts and rapid glancings around the room--as\r\nif she were fearful lest some terrible specter were present to scare\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice her eyes lingered on her mother's portrait; and then\r\nprofound sighs escaped her bosom.\r\n\r\nPresently the beautiful Flora Francatelli entered the apartment; but\r\nNisida made her a sign of dismissal.\r\n\r\nThe maiden withdrew; and we must now follow her to her own chamber.\r\n\r\nOn reaching her bedroom, Flora did not immediately retire to rest. She\r\nfelt that she should not sleep, even were she to seek her pillow: for\r\nshe had much--very much to ponder upon!\r\n\r\nThere was a marked, undisguised reserve about her mistress which\r\nmaterially affected her. Although she could not control her affections,\r\nyet she felt as if she were acting with duplicity toward the Lady Nisida\r\nin having listened to the love-tale of Francisco, and, retaining that\r\nrevelation of his affection a secret in her own breast.\r\n\r\nYet--had he not implored, had he not enjoined her to keep that avowal to\r\nherself? Yes, and when she looked at the matter, as it were, face to\r\nface, she could not justly reproach herself:--nevertheless, that secret\r\nlove weighed upon her conscience like a crime!\r\n\r\nShe could not understand wherefore Nisida's manner had changed toward\r\nher. Francisco had assuredly made no communication to his sister; and\r\nnothing had transpired to excite a suspicion of the real truth in her\r\nmind. Still there _was_ a coolness on the part of that lady:--or might\r\nit not be that Flora's imagination deceived her?\r\n\r\nThere was another, and even a more serious cause of grief weighing upon\r\nher mind. Dispatches had been received from the nobleman in whose suit\r\nher brother Alessandro had repaired to Constantinople; and the secretary\r\nof the council of Florence had intimated to Signora Francatelli (Flora's\r\naunt) that Alessandro had abjured the faith of his forefathers and had\r\nembraced the Mussulman creed. It was also stated that the young man had\r\nentered the service of grand vizier; but whether he had become a\r\nrenegade through love for some Turkish maiden, or with the hope of\r\nameliorating his condition in a worldly point of view, whether, indeed,\r\nself-interest or a conscientious belief in the superiority of the Moslem\r\ndoctrines over those of Christianity, had swayed Alessandro, no one\r\ncould say.\r\n\r\nHis aunt was almost heart-broken at the news. Father Marco, through\r\nwhose influence he had obtained the post of secretary to the Florentine\r\nEnvoy, was shocked and grieved; and Flora was not the less afflicted at\r\nan event which, as she had been taught to believe, must inevitably place\r\nher much-loved brother beyond the hope of spiritual salvation.\r\n\r\nAmidst the gloomy reflections excited by the Lady Nisida's coolness, and\r\nthe disagreeable tidings which had been received concerning her brother,\r\nthere was nevertheless one gleam of consolation for Flora Francatelli.\r\n\r\nThis was the love which Francisco entertained for her, and which she so\r\ntenderly, so sincerely reciprocated.\r\n\r\nYes, a maiden's first love is ever a source of solace amidst the gloom\r\nof affliction; because it is so intimately intertwined with hope! For\r\nthe soul of the innocent, artless girl who fondly loves, soars aloft in\r\na heaven of her own creation, dove-like on the wings of faith!\r\n\r\nIt was already late when Flora began to unbraid and set at liberty her\r\ndark brown tresses, preparatory to retiring to rest, when a low knock at\r\nthe chamber-door startled her in the midst of her occupation.\r\n\r\nThinking it might be the Lady Nisida who required her attendance she\r\nhastened to open the door; and immediately three women, dressed in\r\nreligious habits and having black veils thrown over their heads so as\r\ncompletely to conceal their faces, entered the room.\r\n\r\nFlora uttered a faint scream--for the sudden apparition of those\r\nspecter-like figures, at such a late hour of the night, was well\r\ncalculated to alarm even a person of maturer age and stronger mind than\r\nSignora Francatelli.\r\n\r\n\"You must accompany us, young lady,\" said the foremost nun, advancing\r\ntoward her. \"And beware how you create any disturbance--for it will\r\navail you nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither am I to be conducted?\" asked Flora, trembling from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\"That we cannot inform you,\" was the reply. \"Neither must you know at\r\npresent; and therefore our first duty is to blindfold you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pity me--have mercy upon me!\" exclaimed Flora, throwing herself on her\r\nknees before the nun who addressed her in so harsh, so stern a manner.\r\n\"I am a poor, unprotected girl: have mercy upon me!\"\r\n\r\nBut the three nuns seized upon her; and while one held the palm of her\r\nhand forcibly over her mouth so as to check her utterance, the others\r\nhastily blindfolded her.\r\n\r\nFlora was so overcome by this alarming proceeding, that she fainted.\r\n\r\nWhen she came to her senses, she found herself lying on a hard and sorry\r\ncouch in a large apartment, almost entirely denuded of furniture and\r\nlighted by a feebly-burning lamp suspended to the low ceiling.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she thought she was laboring under the influence of a\r\nhideous dream; but, glancing around, she started with affright, and a\r\nscream burst from her lips, when she beheld the three nuns standing by\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you brought me hither?\" she demanded, springing from the\r\ncouch, and addressing the recluses with frantic wildness.\r\n\r\n\"To benefit you in a spiritual sense,\" replied the one who had before\r\nacted as spokeswoman: \"to purge your mind of those mundane vanities\r\nwhich have seized upon it, and to render you worthy of salvation. Pray,\r\nsisters--pray for this at present benighted creature!\"\r\n\r\nThen, to the surprise of the young maiden, the three nuns all fell upon\r\ntheir knees around her, and began to chant a solemn hymn in most\r\nlugubrious notes.\r\n\r\nThey had thrown aside their veils, and the flickering light of the dim\r\nlamp gave a ghastly and unearthly appearance to their pale and severe\r\ncountenances. They were all three elderly persons: and their aspect was\r\nof that cold, forbidding nature, which precludes hope on the part of any\r\none who might have to implore mercy.\r\n\r\nThe young maiden was astounded--stupefied--she knew not what to\r\nconjecture. Where was she? who were those nuns that had treated her so\r\nharshly? why was she brought to that cold, cheerless apartment? what\r\nmeant the hymn that seemed chanted expressly on her account?\r\n\r\nShe could not bear up against the bewilderment and alarm produced by\r\nthese questions which she asked herself, and none of which she could\r\nsolve. An oppressive sensation came over her; and she was about to sink\r\nback upon the couch from which she had risen, when the hymn suddenly\r\nceased--the nuns rose from their suppliant posture--and the foremost,\r\naddressing the poor girl in a reproachful tone, exclaimed, \"Oh!\r\nwicked--worldly-minded creature, repent--repent--repent!\"\r\n\r\nThere was something so awful--so appalling--in this strange conduct on\r\nthe part of the nuns, that Flora began to doubt whether she were not\r\nlaboring under some terrible delusion. She feared lest her senses were\r\nleaving her: and, covering her face with her hands, so as to close her\r\neyes against external objects, she endeavored to look inward, as it\r\nwere, and scrutinize her own soul.\r\n\r\nBut she was not allowed time to reflect; for the three nuns seized upon\r\nher, the foremost saying, \"You must come with us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! mercy!\" screamed the wretched girl, vainly struggling in the\r\npowerful grasp of the recluses.\r\n\r\nHer long hair, which she had unbraided before she was carried off from\r\nthe Riverola mansion, floated over her shoulders, and enhanced the\r\nexpression of ineffable despair which her pallid countenance now wore.\r\n\r\nWildly she glanced around, as she was being hurried from the room; and\r\nfrantic screams escaped her lips. But there was no one nigh to\r\nsuccor--no one to melt at the outbursts of her anguish!\r\n\r\nThe three nuns dragged, rather than conducted her to an adjacent\r\napartment, which was lighted by a lamp of astonishing brilliancy, and\r\nhung in a skylight raised above the roof.\r\n\r\nOn the floor, immediately beneath this lamp, stood an armchair of\r\nwicker-work; and from this chair two stout cords ascended to the\r\nceiling, through which they passed by means of two holes perforated for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen Flora was dragged by the nuns to the immediate vicinity of the\r\nchair, which her excited imagination instantly converted into an engine\r\nof torture, that part of the floor on which the chair stood seemed to\r\ntremble and oscillate beneath her feet, as if it were a trap-door.\r\n\r\nThe most dreadful sensations now came over her: she felt as if her brain\r\nwas reeling--as if she must go mad.\r\n\r\nA fearful scream burst from her lips, and she struggled with the energy\r\nof desperation, as the nuns endeavored to thrust her into the chair.\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" she exclaimed, frantically; \"you shall not torture me--you\r\ndare not murder me! What have I done to merit this treatment! Mercy!\r\nmercy!\"\r\n\r\nBut her cries and her struggles were alike useless; for she was now\r\nfirmly bound to the chair, into which the nuns had forced her to seat\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nThen commenced the maddening scene which will be found in the ensuing\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE DESCENT--THE CHAMBER OF PENITENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving bound Flora Francatelli to the chair in the manner just\r\ndescribed, the three nuns fell back a few paces, and the wretched girl\r\nfelt the floor giving way under her.\r\n\r\nA dreadful scream burst from her lips, as slowly--slowly the chair sank\r\ndown, while the working of hidden machinery in the roof, and the steady,\r\nmonotonous revolution of wheels, sounded with ominous din upon her ears.\r\n\r\nAn icy stream appeared to pour over her soul; wildly she cast around her\r\neyes, and then more piercing became her shrieks, as she found herself\r\ngradually descending into what seemed to be a pit or well--only that it\r\nwas square instead of round.\r\n\r\nThe ropes creaked--the machinery continued its regular movement, and the\r\nlamp fixed in the skylight overhead became less and less brilliant.\r\n\r\nAnd bending over the mouth of this pit into which she was descending\r\nwere the three nuns--standing motionless and silent like hideous\r\nspecters, on the brink of the aperture left by the square platform or\r\ntrap, whereon the chair was fixed.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! Mercy!\" exclaimed Flora, in a voice expressive of the most acute\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nAnd stretching forth her snowy arms (for it was round the waist and by\r\nthe feet that she was fastened to the chair), she convulsively placed\r\nher open palms against the wooden walls of the pit, as if she could by\r\nthat spasmodic movement arrest the descent of the terrible apparatus\r\nthat was bearing her down into that hideous, unknown gulf! But the walls\r\nwere smooth and even, and presented nothing whereon she could fix her\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nHer brain reeled, and for a few minutes she sat motionless, in dumb,\r\ninert despair.\r\n\r\nThen again, in obedience to some mechanical impulse, she glanced upward;\r\nthe light of the lamp was now dimly seen, like the sun through a dense\r\nmist--but the dark figures were still bending over the brink of the\r\nabyss, thirty yards above.\r\n\r\nThe descent was still progressing and the noise of the machinery still\r\nreached her ears, with buzzing, humming, monotonous indistinctness.\r\n\r\nShe shrieked not now--she screamed not any more; but it was not\r\nresignation that sealed her lips;--it was despair!\r\n\r\nSuddenly she became aware of the gradual disappearance of the three\r\nnuns; as she descended, the wall seemed to rise slowly upward and cover\r\nthem from her view.\r\n\r\nThen, for an instant there was a slight shock given to the platform\r\nwhereon the chair was placed--as if it rested on something beneath.\r\n\r\nBut no;--the fearful descent still went on--for, when she again\r\nstretched forth her hand to touch the walls, they appeared to be slowly\r\nrising--rising!\r\n\r\nShe was now involved in almost total darkness; but far--far overhead the\r\ndim luster of the lamp was seen; and the four walls of the gulf now\r\nappeared to touch the ceiling of the room above, and to inclose that\r\nfaint but still distinct orb within the narrow space thus shut in.\r\n\r\nThe noise of the machinery also reached her still--but merely with a\r\nhumming sound that was only just audible.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she doubted whether she was still descending; but, alas!\r\nwhen her arms were a third time convulsively stretched forth, her fair\r\nhands felt the walls slipping away from her touch--gliding upward, as it\r\nwere, with steady emotion.\r\n\r\nThen she knew that the descent had not ceased.\r\n\r\nBut whither was she going? to what awful depth was she progressing?\r\n\r\nAlready she conjectured, was she at least sixty yards beneath that dim\r\nyellow orb which every instant appeared to shine as through a deeper,\r\ndeepening mist.\r\n\r\nFor what fate was she reserved? and where was she?\r\n\r\nSuddenly it struck her that she was an inmate of the Carmelite Convent;\r\nfor the rumors alluded to in a preceding chapter had often met her ears;\r\nand her imagination naturally associated them with the occurrences of\r\nthat dreadful night.\r\n\r\nThe piercing shrieks--the noise of machinery--the disappearance from\r\ntime to time of some member of that monastic institution, all the\r\nincidents, in fine, to which those rumors had ever pointed, now seemed\r\nto apply to her own case.\r\n\r\nThese reflections flashed, with lightning rapidity, through her brain,\r\nand paralyzed her with horror.\r\n\r\nThen she lost all further power of thought; and though not absolutely\r\nfainting, she was stunned and stupefied with the tremendous weight of\r\noverwhelming despair.\r\n\r\nHow long she remained in this condition she knew not; but she was\r\nsuddenly aroused by the opening of a low door in the wall in front of\r\nher.\r\n\r\nStarting as from a dreadful dream, she stretched forth her arms, and\r\nbecame aware that the descent had stopped; and at the same moment she\r\nbeheld a nun, bearing a lamp, standing on the threshold of the door\r\nwhich had just opened.\r\n\r\n\"Sister, welcome to the chamber of penitence!\" said the recluse,\r\napproaching the terrified Flora.\r\n\r\nThen, placing the lamp in a niche near the door, the nun proceeded to\r\nremove the cords which fastened the young maiden to the chair.\r\n\r\nFlora rose, but fell back again on the seat--for her limbs were stiff in\r\nconsequence of the length of time they had been retained in one\r\nposition. The nun disappeared by the little door for a few minutes; and,\r\non her return, presented the wretched girl a cup of cold water. Flora\r\nswallowed the icy beverage, and felt refreshed.\r\n\r\nThen, by the light of the lamp in the niche, she hastily examined the\r\ncountenance of the nun; but its expression was cold--repulsive--stern:\r\nand Flora knew that it was useless to seek to make a friend of her.\r\n\r\nA frightful sense of loneliness, as it were, struck her like an\r\nice-shaft penetrating to her very soul; and clasping her hands together,\r\nshe exclaimed: \"Holy Virgin! protect me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No harm will befall you, daughter,\" said the nun, \"if you manifest\r\ncontrition for past errors and a resolution to devote your future years\r\nto the service of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"My past errors!\" repeated Flora, with mingled indignation and\r\nastonishment. \"I am not aware that I ever injured a living soul by a\r\nword or deed--nor entertained a thought for which I need to blush!\r\nNeither have I neglected those duties which manifest the gratitude of\r\nmortals for the bounties bestowed upon them by Providence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! daughter,\" exclaimed the nun, \"you interpret not your own heart\r\nrightly. Have you never abandoned yourself to those carnal\r\nnotions--those hopes--those fears--those dreams of happiness--which\r\nconstitute the passion which the world calls love?\"\r\n\r\nFlora started, and a blush mantled on her cheeks, before so pale!\r\n\r\n\"You see that I have touched a chord which vibrates to your heart's\r\ncore, daughter,\" continued the nun, on whom that sudden evidence of\r\nemotion was not lost. \"You have suffered yourself to be deluded by the\r\nwhisperings of that feeling whose tendency was to wean your soul from\r\nHeaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it possible that a pure and virtuous love can be construed into\r\na crime?\" demanded the young maiden, her indignation overpowering her\r\nfears.\r\n\r\n\"A love that is founded on, and fostered by ambition is a sin,\" replied\r\nthe nun. \"Marriage is doubtless an institution ordained by Heaven; but\r\nit becomes a curse, and is repulsive to all pious feelings, when it\r\nunites those whose passion is made up of sensuality and selfishness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You dare not impute such base considerations to me!\" exclaimed Flora,\r\nher cheeks again flushing, but with the glow of conscious innocence\r\nshamefully outraged by the most injurious suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, daughter,\" continued the nun, unmoved by the manner of the young\r\nmaiden; \"you are unable to judge rightly of your own heart. You possess\r\na confidence in integrity of purpose, which is but a mental blindness on\r\nyour part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what am I accused? and wherefore am I brought hither?\" asked Flora,\r\nbeginning to feel bewildered by the sophistry that characterized the\r\nnun's discourse.\r\n\r\n\"Those who are interested in your welfare,\" replied the nun evasively,\r\n\"have consigned you to the care of persons devoted to the service of\r\nHeaven, that your eyes may be opened to the vanity of the path which you\r\nhave been pursuing, but from which you are so happily rescued.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where am I? is this the Convent of the Carmelites? why was I\r\nsubjected to all the alarms--all the mental tortures through which I\r\nhave just passed?\" demanded the young maiden, wildly and rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Think not that we have acted toward you in a spirit of persecution,\"\r\nsaid the nun. \"The mysteries which have alarmed you will be explained at\r\na future period, when your soul is prepared by penance,\r\nself-mortification, and prayer to receive the necessary revelation. In\r\nthe meantime, ask no questions, forget the world, and resolve to embrace\r\na life devoted to the service of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"To embrace a conventual existence!\" almost shrieked the wretched girl.\r\n\"Oh! no, never!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not many days will elapse ere your mind will undergo a salutary\r\nchange,\" said the nun, composedly. \"But if you will follow me--as you\r\nappear to be somewhat recovered--I will conduct you to your cell\r\nadjoining the Chamber of Penitence.\"\r\n\r\nFlora, perceiving that any further attempt to reason with the recluse\r\nwould be fruitlessly made, rose and followed her into a narrow, dark\r\npassage, at the end of which was a door standing half open.\r\n\r\nThe nun extinguished her lamp, and led the way into a large apartment\r\nhung with black. At the further end there was an altar, surmounted by a\r\ncrucifix of ebony, and lighted up with four wax candles, which only\r\nserved to render the gloom of the entire scene more apparent.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the altar knelt five women, half naked, and holding\r\nscourges in their hands.\r\n\r\n\"These are the penitents,\" whispered the nun to Flora. \"Pause for a\r\nmoment and contemplate them.\"\r\n\r\nA minute elapsed, during which the five penitents remained motionless as\r\nstatues, with their heads bowed upon their bosoms, and their hands\r\nhanging down by their sides, as if those limbs were lifeless--save in\r\nrespect to the hands that held the scourges. But, suddenly, one of\r\nthem--a young and beautiful woman--exclaimed, in a tone of piercing\r\nanguish, \"It is my fault! it is my fault! it is my fault!\"--and the\r\nothers took up the wail in voices equally characteristic of heartfelt\r\nwoe.\r\n\r\nThen they lacerated their shoulders with the hard leathern thongs of\r\ntheir scourges; and a faintness came over Flora Francatelli when she\r\nobserved the blood appear on the back of the young and beautiful\r\npenitent who had given the signal for this self-mortification.\r\n\r\nThe nun, perceiving the effect thus produced upon the maiden, touched\r\nher upon the shoulder as a signal to follow whither she was about to\r\nlead; and, opening one of the several doors communicating with the\r\nChamber of Penitence, she said in a low whisper--\"This is your cell. May\r\nthe Virgin bless you!\"\r\n\r\nFlora entered the little room allotted to her, and the nun retired,\r\nsimply closing, but not bolting the door behind her.\r\n\r\nA taper burnt before a crucifix suspended to the wall; and near it hung\r\na scourge, from which last mentioned object Flora averted her eyes with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nA bed, a simple toilet-table, a praying-desk, and a single chair,\r\ncompleted the furniture of the cell, which was of very narrow\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nSeating herself on the bed, Flora burst into an agony of tears.\r\n\r\nWhat would her aunt think when she received the news of her\r\ndisappearance? for she could not suppose that any friendly feeling on\r\nthe part of her persecutors would induce them to adopt a course which\r\nmight relieve that much-loved relative's mind concerning her. What would\r\nFrancisco conjecture? Oh! these thoughts were maddening!\r\n\r\nAnxious to escape from them, if possible, the almost heartbroken girl\r\nproceeded to lay aside her garments and retire to rest.\r\n\r\nPhysical and mental exhaustion cast her into a deep sleep; but the\r\nhorrors of her condition pursued her even in her dreams; so that when\r\nshe awoke she was not startled to find herself in that gloomy cell.\r\n\r\nCasting her eyes around, she observed two circumstances which showed her\r\nthat some one had visited her room during the hours she slept; for a new\r\ntaper was burning before the crucifix, and her own garments had been\r\nremoved,--the coarse garb of a penitent now occupying their place on the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! is it possible that I am doomed to bid farewell to the world\r\nforever?\" exclaimed Flora, in a voice of despair, as she clasped her\r\nhands convulsively together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO AND NISIDA--DR. DURAS AND THE LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest confusion prevailed in the Riverola Palace, when, in the\r\nmorning, the disappearance of Flora Francatelli was discovered.\r\n\r\nNisida hastened, at an early hour, to her brother's apartment, and\r\nintimated to him the fact that she was nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nFrancisco, who was already dressed, was overwhelmed with grief at this\r\nannouncement, and, in the first excess of excitement, conveyed to her\r\nhis intention of seeking the young maiden throughout the city.\r\n\r\nHe was hastening to quit the room, when Nisida held him back, and\r\nintimated to him that his anxiety in this respect would create\r\nsuspicions injurious alike to his reputation and that of Flora\r\nFrancatelli--the more so, as she was but a menial in the household.\r\n\r\nFrancisco paused and reflected for a few moments; then, having tenderly\r\nembraced his sister, he hastily addressed her by the symbolic language\r\nin which they were accustomed to converse:\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, beloved Nisida, for having kept a secret from thee--the only\r\none that my heart has ever so selfishly cherished.\"\r\n\r\nNisida appeared to be profoundly astonished at this communication, and\r\nmade an impatient sign for him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\"You will not be surprised at my anxiety to seek after the missing\r\ngirl,\" he continued, \"when I intimate to you that I love her--and that,\r\nnext to yourself, she is dearer to me than I can express.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your passion can scarcely be an honorable one, Francisco,\" was the\r\nreproach conveyed by Nisida, while her countenance wore a corresponding\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"I would sooner die than harbor an injurious thought in respect to that\r\nvirtuous and beautiful creature!\" responded the young count, his face\r\nflushed with the glow of generous emotions. \"My happiness is intimately\r\nconnected with this attachment, Nisida, and I feel convinced that you\r\nwould rather forward my views than oppose them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear brother,\" was the reply which she conveyed to him: \"your\r\nhappiness is my only consideration.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as she gave this assurance, an ill-subdued sigh escaped her breast,\r\nand she compressed her lips tightly to crush the emotions that were\r\nagitating her. A cloud evanescently appeared on the broad and marble\r\nforehead; the penciled brows contracted, and the eyes flashed\r\nbrightly--oh! far more brightly than glanced the ray of the morning sun\r\nthrough the windows, upon the glossy surface of her luxuriant hair. A\r\nmomentary spasm seemed to convulse the full and rounded form; and the\r\nsmall, elegantly shaped foot which peered from beneath her flowing robe,\r\ntapped the floor twice with involuntary movement.\r\n\r\nMistress as she usually was of even her most intense feelings, and\r\nwonderfully habituated by circumstances to exercise the most complete\r\ncommand over her emotions, she was now for an instant vanquished by the\r\ngush of painful sentiments which crowded on her soul.\r\n\r\nFrancisco did not, however, observe that transitory evidence of acute\r\nfeeling on the part of his sister--a feeling which seemed to partake of\r\nthe nature of remorse, as if she were conscience-stricken!\r\n\r\nFor she loved her brother deeply--tenderly, but after the fashion of her\r\nown wild and wonderful disposition--a love that was not calculated\r\nalways to prove friendly to his interests.\r\n\r\nFrancisco paced the room in an agitated manner.\r\n\r\nAt length he stopped near where his sister was standing, and intimated\r\nto her that Flora might perhaps have repaired to the residence of her\r\naunt.\r\n\r\nNisida conveyed to him this answer: \"The moment that I missed Flora ere\r\nnow, I dispatched a domestic to her aunt's cottage; but she has not been\r\nthere since Sunday last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some treachery is at work here, Nisida,\" was the young count's\r\nresponse. \"Flora has not willingly absented herself.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Francisco's page entered the apartment to announce that\r\nDr. Duras was in the reception-room.\r\n\r\nThe young count made a sign to his sister to accompany him; and they\r\nproceeded to the elegant saloon where the physician was waiting.\r\n\r\nHaving saluted the count and Nisida with his usual urbanity, Dr. Duras\r\naddressed himself to the former, saying, \"I have just learnt from your\r\nlordship's page that the favorite attendant on your sister has most\r\nunaccountably disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"And both Nisida and myself are at a loss what to conjecture, or how to\r\nact,\" replied Francisco.\r\n\r\n\"Florence is at this moment the scene of dreadful crimes,\" observed the\r\nphysician. \"Yesterday morning a young female was murdered by a near\r\nneighbor of mine----\"\r\n\r\n\"I was astounded when I heard of the arrest of Signor Wagner on such a\r\ncharge,\" interrupted the count. \"He was latterly a frequent guest at\r\nthis house: although, I believe, you never happened to meet him here?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the physician; \"but I saw him at the funeral of your\r\nlamented father, and once or twice since in the garden attached to his\r\nmansion; and I certainly could not have supposed, from his appearance,\r\nthat he was a man capable of so black a crime. I was, however, about to\r\nobserve that Florence is at this moment infested by a class of villains\r\nwho hesitate at no deed of turpitude. This Signor Wagner is a foreigner,\r\npossessed of immense wealth, the sources of which are totally unknown;\r\nand, moreover, it is declared that the sbirri, yesterday morning,\r\nactually traced the robber-captain Stephano to the vicinity of his\r\nmansion. All this looks black enough, and it is more than probable that\r\nWagner was in league with the redoubtable Stephano and his banditti.\r\nThen the mysterious disappearance of Flora is, to say the least,\r\nalarming, for I believe she was a well conducted, virtuous, estimable\r\nyoung woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was--she was indeed!\" exclaimed Francisco. \"At least,\" he added,\r\nperceiving that the physician was somewhat astonished at the enthusiasm\r\nwith which he spoke--\"at least, such is my firm impression; such, too,\r\nis the opinion of my sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"The motive which brought me hither this morning,\" said Dr. Duras, \"was\r\nto offer you a little friendly advice, which my long acquaintance with\r\nyour family, my dear count, will prevent you from taking amiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, doctor--speak your thoughts!\" cried Francisco, pressing the\r\nphysician's hand gratefully.\r\n\r\n\"I would recommend you to be more cautious how you form an intimacy with\r\nstrangers,\" continued Dr. Duras. \"Rumor has a thousand tongues--and it\r\nis already reported in Florence that the alleged murderer was on\r\nfamiliar terms with the noble Count of Riverola and Lady Nisida.\"\r\n\r\n\"The duke himself is liable to be deceived in respect to the real\r\ncharacter of an individual,\" said Francisco proudly.\r\n\r\n\"But his highness would not form hasty acquaintances,\" replied the\r\nphysician. \"After all, it is with the best possible feeling that I offer\r\nyou my counsel--knowing your generous heart, and also how frequently\r\ngenerosity is imposed upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon the impatience with which I answered you, my dear friend,\"\r\nexclaimed the young count.\r\n\r\n\"No pardon is necessary,\" said the physician; \"because you did not\r\noffend me. One word more and I must take my leave. Crimes are\r\nmultiplying thickly in Florence, and Stephano's band becomes each day\r\nmore and more daring; so that it is unsafe to walk alone in the city\r\nafter dusk. Beware how you stir unattended, my dear Francisco, at\r\nunseasonable hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"My habits are not of that nature,\" replied the count. \"I, however,\r\nthank you cordially for your well-meant advice. But you appear to\r\nconnect the disappearance of Flora Francatelli,\" he added, very\r\nseriously, \"with the dreadful deed supposed to be committed by Signor\r\nWagner!\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely conjecture that this Wagner is associated with that lawless\r\nhorde who have become the terror of the republic,\" answered the\r\nphysician; \"and it is natural to suppose that these wretches are guilty\r\nof all the enormous crimes which have lately struck the city with\r\nalarm.\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco turned aside to conceal the emotions which these remarks\r\nexcited within him; for he began to apprehend that she whom he loved so\r\nfondly had met with foul play at the hands of the bravoes and banditti\r\nwhom Stephano was known to command.\r\n\r\nDr. Duras seized that opportunity to approach Nisida, who was standing\r\nat the window; and as he thrust into her hand a note, which was\r\nimmediately concealed in her dress, he was struck with surprise and\r\ngrief at the acute anguish that was depicted on her countenance.\r\n\r\nLarge tears stood on her long, dark lashes, and her face was ashy pale.\r\n\r\nThe physician made a sign of anxious inquiry; but Nisida, subduing her\r\nemotions with an almost superhuman effort, pressed his hand violently\r\nand hurried from the room.\r\n\r\nDr. Duras shook his head mournfully, but also in a manner which showed\r\nthat he was at a loss to comprehend that painful manifestation of\r\nfeeling on the part of one whom he well knew to be endowed with almost\r\nmiraculous powers of self-control.\r\n\r\nHis meditations were interrupted by Francisco, who, addressing him\r\nabruptly, said, \"In respect to the missing young lady, whose absence\r\nwill be so acutely felt by my sister, the only course which I can at\r\npresent pursue, is to communicate her mysterious disappearance to the\r\ncaptain of police.\"\r\n\r\n\"No time should be lost in adopting that step,\" responded the doctor. \"I\r\nam about to visit a sick nobleman in the neighborhood of the captain's\r\noffice: we will proceed so far in each other's company.\"\r\n\r\nThe young count summoned his page to attend upon him, and then quitted\r\nthe mansion in company with the physician.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Nisida had retired to her own apartment, where she threw\r\nherself into a seat, and gave vent to the dreadful emotions which had\r\nfor the last hour been agitating within her bosom.\r\n\r\nShe wept--oh! she wept long and bitterly: it was terrible and strange to\r\nthink how that woman of iron mind now yielded to the outpourings of her\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed ere she even attempted to control her feelings; and\r\nthen her struggle to subdue them was as sudden and energetic as her\r\ngrief had a moment previously been violent and apparently inconsolable.\r\n\r\nThen she recollected the note which Dr. Duras had slipped into her hand,\r\nand which she had concealed in her bosom; and she hastened to peruse it.\r\nThe contents ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"In accordance with your request, my noble-hearted and\r\n    much-enduring friend, I have consulted eminent lawyers in\r\n    respect to the will of the late Count of Riverola. The substance\r\n    of their opinion is unanimously this: The estates are\r\n    inalienably settled on yourself, should you recover the\r\n    faculties of hearing and speaking at any time previous to your\r\n    brother's attainment of the age of thirty; and should you enter\r\n    into possession of the estates, and allow your brother to enjoy\r\n    the whole or greater part of the revenues, in direct\r\n    contradiction to the spirit of your father's will, the estates\r\n    would become liable to confiscation by his highness the duke. In\r\n    this case your brother and yourself would alike be ruined.\r\n\r\n    \"Now, the advice that these lawyers give is this: A memorial\r\n    should be addressed to his highness, exhibiting that you refuse\r\n    to undergo any surgical treatment or operation for the\r\n    restoration of the faculties of hearing and speech, inasmuch as\r\n    you would not wish to deprive your brother of the enjoyment of\r\n    the estates nor of the title conferred by their possession: that\r\n    you therefore solicit a decree, confirming his title of\r\n    nobility, and dispensing with the prerogative of confiscation on\r\n    the part of the prince, should you recover the faculties of\r\n    hearing and speech, and act in opposition to the will of your\r\n    late father in respect to the power of alienating the estates\r\n    from your own possession.\r\n\r\n    \"Such, my generous-minded friend, is the counsel offered by\r\n    eminent advocates; and, by the memory of your sainted mother, if\r\n    not for the sake of your own happiness, I implore you to act in\r\n    accordance with these suggestions. You will remember that this\r\n    advice pretty accurately corresponds with that which I gave you,\r\n    when, late on the night that the will was read, you quitted your\r\n    sleepless couch and came to my dwelling to consult me on a point\r\n    so intimately connected with your felicity in this world.\r\n\r\n                    \"Your sincerely devoted friend,\r\n                                               \"JERONYMO DURAS.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Nisida was occupied in the perusal of the first paragraph of this\r\nletter, dark clouds lowered upon her brow; but as she read the second\r\nparagraph, wherein the salutary advice of the lawyers was conveyed to\r\nher, those clouds rapidly dispersed, and her splendid countenance became\r\nlighted up with joyous, burning, intoxicating hope!\r\n\r\nIt was evident that she had already made up her mind to adopt the\r\ncounsel proffered her by the eminent advocates whom the friendly\r\nphysician had consulted on her behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE SUBURB OF ALLA CROCE--THE JEW--THE ROBBER CHIEF'S LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was past the hour of ten on Saturday night, when a tall, powerfully\r\nbuilt man emerged from what might be termed the fashionable portion of\r\nthe city of Florence, and struck into the straggling suburb of Alla\r\nCroce.\r\n\r\nThis quarter of the town was of marvelously bad reputation, being\r\ninfested by persons of the worst description, who, by herding, as it\r\nwere, together in one particular district, had converted the entire\r\nsuburb into a sort of sanctuary where crime might take refuge, and into\r\nwhich the sbirri, or police-officers, scarcely dared to penetrate.\r\n\r\nThe population of Alla Croce was not, however, entirely composed of\r\nindividuals who were at variance with the law, for poverty as well as\r\ncrime sought an asylum in that assemblage of forbidding-looking\r\ndwellings, which formed so remarkable a contrast with the marble\r\npalaces, noble public buildings, and handsome streets of the city of\r\nFlorence itself.\r\n\r\nAnd not only did the denizens of penury and crushing toil, the artisans,\r\nthe vine-dressers, the gardeners, the water-carriers, and the porters of\r\nFlorence occupy lodgings in the suburb of Alla Croce, but even wealthy\r\npersons--yes, men whose treasures were vast enough to pay the ransom of\r\nprinces--buried themselves and their hoards in this horrible\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nWe allude to that most undeservedly-persecuted race, the Jews--a race\r\nendowed with many virtues and generous qualities, but whose characters\r\nhave been blackened by a host of writers whose narrow minds and\r\nilliberal prejudices have induced them to preserve all the exaggerations\r\nand misrepresentations which tradition hands down in the Christian world\r\nrelative to the cruelly-treated Israelite.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened commercial policy of those merchant princes, the Medici,\r\nhad, during the primal glories of their administrative sway in the\r\nFlorentine Republic, relaxed the severity of the laws against the Jews,\r\nand recognizing in the persecuted Israelites those grand trading and\r\nfinancial qualities which have ever associated the idea of wealth with\r\ntheir name, permitted them to follow unmolested their specific pursuits.\r\n\r\nBut at the time of which we are writing--the year 1521--the prince who\r\nhad the reins of the Florentine Government, had yielded to the\r\nrepresentations of a bigoted and intolerant clergy, and the Jews had\r\nonce more become the subjects of persecution. The dissipated nobles\r\nextorted from them by menace those loans which would not have been\r\ngranted on the security proffered; and the wealthy members of the\r\n\"scattered race\" actually began to discover that they could repose\r\ngreater confidence in the refuse of the Florentine population than in\r\nthe brilliant aristocracy, or even in the famous sbirri themselves. Thus\r\nhad many rich Jews established themselves in the quarter of Alla Croce;\r\nand by paying a certain sum to the syndic, or magistrate of this\r\nsuburb--a functionary elected by the inhabitants themselves, and in\r\nvirtue of a law of their own enactment--the persecuted Israelites\r\nenjoyed comparative security and peace.\r\n\r\nWe now return to the man we left plunging into the suburbs of which we\r\nhave afforded a short and necessary account.\r\n\r\nThis individual was dressed in simple attire, but composed of excellent\r\nmaterials. His vest was of dark velvet, slashed, but not embroidered;\r\nand on his breast he wore a jazeran, or mailed cuirass, which was not\r\nonly lighter than a steel corselet, but was equally proof against\r\nponiard or pike. In his broad leather belt were stuck two pairs of\r\npistols, and a long dagger; a heavy broadsword also hung by his side.\r\nHis black boots came up nearly to the knee--in contravention of the\r\nprevailing fashion of that age, when these articles of dress seldom\r\nreached above the swell of the leg. A large slouched hat, without\r\nplumage or any ornament, was drawn down as much as possible over his\r\nfeatures; and the broad _mantello_, or cloak, was gathered round the\r\nbody in such a manner that it covered all the left side and the weapons\r\nfastened in the belt, but left the sword arm free for use in any sudden\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nBehind the wayfarer stretched the magnificent city of Florence,\r\nspreading over the deep vale, on both sides of the Arno, and, as usual,\r\nbrilliant with light, like a world of stars shining in mimic rivalry of\r\nthose that studded the purple vault above.\r\n\r\nBefore him were the mazes of the Alla Croce, the darkness of which\r\nsuburb was only interrupted by a few straggling and feeble lights\r\ngleaming from houses of entertainment, or from huts whose poverty\r\nrequired not the protection of shutters to the casements.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as one of those faint lights suddenly fell upon the wayfarer's\r\ncountenance, as he passed the abode in which it shone--let us avail\r\nourselves of the opportunity afforded by that glimpse, to state that\r\nthis man's features were handsome, but coarse, bearing the traces of a\r\ndissolute life. His age was apparently forty; it might even have been a\r\nfew years more matured--but his coal-black hair, mustachio, and bushy\r\nwhiskers, unstreaked by silver, showed that time sat lightly on his\r\nhead, in spite of the evident intimacy with the wine-cup above alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\nHaving threaded the greater portion of the suburb, which was almost\r\nknee-deep in mud--for it had been raining nearly all day, and had only\r\ncleared up after sunset--the individual whom we have been describing\r\nstopped at the corner of a street, and gave a shrill whistle.\r\n\r\nThe signal was immediately answered in a similar fashion, and in a few\r\nminutes a man emerged from the darkness of a by-street. He also was\r\nwell-armed, but much more plainly dressed than the other; and his\r\ncountenance was such as would not have proved a very friendly witness in\r\nhis favor in a court of justice.\r\n\r\n\"Lomellino?\" said the first individual whom we have described in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Stephano!\" responded the other.\r\n\r\n\"All right, my fine lad,\" returned the bandit-captain. \"Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nThe two robbers then proceeded in silence until they reached a house\r\nlarger and stronger in appearance than any other in the same street. The\r\nshutters which protected the casements were massive and strengthened\r\nwith iron bars and huge nails, somewhat after the fashion of church\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nThe walls were of solid gray stones, whereas those of the adjacent huts\r\nwere of mud or wood. In a word, this dwelling seemed a little fortress\r\nin the midst of an exposed and unprotected town.\r\n\r\nBefore this house the robbers stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remain on the other side of the street, Lomellino,\" said the\r\nbandit-chief; \"and if need be, you will answer to my accustomed signal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, captain,\" was the reply; and Lomellino crossed over the way to\r\nthe deep shade of the houses on that side.\r\n\r\nStephano then gave a low knock at the door of the well-defended dwelling\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\nSeveral minutes elapsed; and no sounds were heard within.\r\n\r\n\"The old usurer is at home, I know,\" muttered Stephano to himself; for\r\nthe moment he had knocked a gleam of light, peeping through a crevice in\r\nan upper casement, had suddenly disappeared. He now rapped more loudly\r\nat the door with the handle of his heavy broadsword.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! he comes!\" muttered the bandit-chief, after another long pause.\r\n\r\n\"Who knocks so late?\" demanded a weak and tremulous voice from within.\r\n\r\n\"I--Stephano Verrina!\" cried the brigand pompously: \"open--and fear\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nThe bolts were drawn back--a chain fell heavily on the stone floor\r\ninside--and the door opened, revealing the form of an old and\r\nvenerable-looking man, with a long white beard. He held a lamp in his\r\nhand: and, by its fitful glare, his countenance, of the Jewish cast,\r\nmanifested an expression denoting the terror which he vainly endeavored\r\nto conceal.\r\n\r\n\"Enter. Signor Stephano,\" said the old man. \"But wherefore here so\r\nlate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Late, do ye call it. Signor Isaachar?\" ejaculated the bandit, crossing\r\nthe threshold. \"Meseems there is yet time to do a world of business this\r\nnight, for those who have the opportunity and the inclination.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but you and yours turn night into day,\" replied the Jew, with a\r\nchuckle intended to be of a conciliatory nature: \"or rather you perform\r\nyour avocations at a time when others sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one to his calling, friend Isaachar,\" said the brigand chief.\r\n\"Come! have you not made that door fast enough yet? you will have to\r\nopen it soon again--for my visit will be none of the longest.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew having replaced the chains and fastened the huge bolts which\r\nprotected the house-door, took up the lamp and led the way to a small\r\nand meanly-furnished room at the back of his dwelling.\r\n\r\n\"What business may have brought you hither to-night, good Captain\r\nVerrina?\" he inquired in a tone of ill-subdued apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Not to frighten thee out of thy wits, good Isaachar,\" responded\r\nStephano, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ha!\" exclaimed the Jew, partially reassured: \"perhaps you have come\r\nto repay me the few crowns I had the honor to lend you--without\r\nsecurity, and without interest----\"\r\n\r\n\"By my patron saint! thou wast never more mistaken in thy life, friend\r\nIsaachar!\" interrupted the robber chief. \"The few crowns you speak of,\r\nwere neither more nor less than a tribute paid on consideration that my\r\nmen should leave unscathed the dwelling of worthy Isaachar ben Solomon:\r\nin other words, that thy treasures should be safe at least from them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--well! be it so!\" cried the Jew. \"Heaven knows I do not grudge the\r\namount in question--although,\" he added slowly, \"I am compelled to pay\r\nalmost an equal sum to the syndic.\"\r\n\r\n\"The syndic of Alla Croce and the captain of the banditti are two very\r\ndifferent persons,\" returned Stephano. \"The magistrate protects you from\r\nthose over whom he has control: and I, on my side, guaranty you against\r\nthe predatory visits of those over whom I exercise command. But let us\r\nto business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay--to business!\" echoed the Jew, anxious to be relieved from the state\r\nof suspense into which this visit had thrown him.\r\n\r\n\"You are acquainted with the young, beautiful, and wealthy Countess of\r\nArestino, Isaachar?\" said the bandit.\r\n\r\nThe Jew stared at him in increased alarm, now mingled with amazement.\r\n\r\n\"But, in spite of all her wealth,\" continued Stephano, \"she was\r\ncompelled to pledge her diamonds to thee, to raise the money wherewith\r\nto discharge a gambling debt contracted by her lover, the high-born,\r\nhandsome, but ruined Marquis of Orsini.\"\r\n\r\n\"How knowest thou all this?\" inquired the Jew.\r\n\r\n\"From her ladyship's own lips,\" responded Stephano. \"At least she told\r\nme she had raised the sum to accommodate a very particular friend. Now,\r\nas the transaction is unknown to her husband, and as I am well assured\r\nthat the Marquis of Orsini is really on most excellent terms with her\r\nladyship--moreover, as this same marquis did pay a certain heavy\r\ngambling debt within an hour after the diamonds were pledged to you--it\r\nrequires but little ingenuity to put all these circumstances together,\r\nto arrive at the result which I have mentioned. Is it not so, Isaachar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not the motive for which the money was raised,\" answered the\r\nJew, wondering what was coming next.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! then the money was raised with you,\" cried Stephano, \"and\r\nconsequently you hold the diamonds.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say so--I----\"\r\n\r\n\"A truce to this fencing with my words!\" ejaculated the bandit,\r\nimpatiently. \"I have an unconquerable desire to behold these\r\ndiamonds----\"\r\n\r\n\"You, good captain!\" murmured Isaachar, trembling from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I! And wherefore not? Is there anything so marvelous in a man of\r\nmy refined tastes and exquisite notions taking a fancy to inspect the\r\njewels of one of the proudest beauties of gay Florence? By my patron\r\nsaint! you should thank me that I come in so polite a manner to request\r\na favor, the granting of which I could so easily compel without all this\r\ntedious circumlocution.\"\r\n\r\n\"The diamonds!\" muttered the Jew, doubtless troubled at the idea of\r\nsurrendering the security which he held for a very considerable loan.\r\n\r\n\"Perdition seize the man!\" thundered Stephano, now waxing angry. \"Yes,\r\nthe diamonds, I say; and fortunate will it be for you if they are\r\nproduced without further parley.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking the bandit suffered his cloak to fall from over his belt,\r\nand the Jew's quick eye recoiled from the sight of those menacing\r\nweapons, with which his visitor was armed, as it were, to the teeth.\r\n\r\nThen without further remonstrance, but with many profound sighs,\r\nIsaachar proceeded to fetch a small iron box from another room; and in a\r\nfew moments the diamond case, made of sandal wood inlaid with\r\nmother-of-pearl, was in the bandit captain's hands.\r\n\r\n\"Let me convince myself that it is all right!\" exclaimed Stephano,\r\nexamining the lid of the case. \"Yes, there are the arms of Arestino,\r\nwith the ciphers of the Countess, G. A.--Giulia Arestino--a very pretty\r\nname, by my troth! Ah, how the stones sparkle!\" he cried, as he opened\r\nthe case. \"And the inventory is complete, just as it was described to me\r\nby her ladyship. You are a worthy man, Isaachar, a good man; you will\r\nhave restored tranquillity to the mind of the beautiful countess,\"\r\ncontinued Stephano, in a bantering tone: \"and she will be enabled to\r\nappear at court to-morrow, with her husband. Good-night, Isaachar; my\r\nbrave men shall receive orders to the effect that the first who dares to\r\nmolest you may reckon upon swinging to the highest tree that I can find\r\nfor his accommodation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You violate your compact, Signor Verrina!\" exclaimed the Jew, his rage\r\nnow mastering his fears. \"Wherefore should I pay you tribute to protect\r\nme, when you enter my house and rob me thus vilely?\"\r\n\r\n\"In this case a lady is concerned, good Isaachar,\" responded the bandit,\r\ncalmly; \"and you know that with all true cavaliers the ladies are\r\npre-eminent. Once more, a fair night's repose, my much respected\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying, Stephano Verrina rose from the seat on which he had been\r\nlounging; and the Jew, knowing that altercation and remonstrance were\r\nequally useless, hastened to afford the means of egress to so unwelcome\r\na visitor.\r\n\r\nStephano lingered a moment opposite the house until he heard the door\r\nbolted and chained behind him; then crossing the street, he rejoined his\r\nfollower, Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"All right, captain?\" said the latter, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" answered Stephano. \"Poor Isaachar is inconsolable, no\r\ndoubt; but the countess will be consoled at his expense. Thus it is with\r\nthe world, Lomellino; what is one person's misery is another's\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dost grow sentimental, good captain?\" exclaimed the man, whose ears\r\nwere entirely unaccustomed to such language on the part of his chief.\r\n\r\n\"Lomellino, my friend,\" answered Verrina, \"when a man is smitten in a\r\ncertain organ, commonly called the heart, he is apt to give utterance to\r\nthat absurdity which the world denominates sentiment. Such is my case.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are, then, in love, captain?\" said Lomellino, as they retraced\r\ntheir way through the suburb of Alla Croce.\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" replied the bandit chief. \"I will tell you how it happened.\r\nYesterday morning, when those impertinent sbirri gave me a harder run\r\nthan I have ever yet experienced, I was fain to take refuge in the\r\ngarden of that very same Signor Wagner----\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was yesterday arrested for murder?\" interrupted Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"The identical one,\" returned Stephano. \"I concealed myself so well that\r\nI knew I might bid defiance to those bungling sbirri--although their\r\nscent was sharpened by the hope of the reward set on my head by the\r\nprince. While I thus lay hidden, I beheld a scene that would have done\r\ngood to the heart of even such a callous fellow as yourself--I mean\r\ncallous to female qualifications. In a word, I saw one woman stab\r\nanother as effectually as----\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was Wagner who killed the woman!\" ejaculated Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"No such thing,\" said Stephano quietly. \"The murderess is of the gentle\r\nsex--though she can scarcely be gentle in disposition. And such a\r\nsplendid creature, Lomellino! I beheld her countenance for a few\r\nminutes, as she drew aside her veil that her eyes might glare upon her\r\nvictim; and I whispered to myself, 'That woman must be mine; she is\r\nworthy of me!' Then the blow descended--her victim lay motionless at her\r\nfeet--and I never took my eyes off the countenance of the murderess.\r\n'She is an incarnate fiend,' I thought, 'and admirably fitted to mate\r\nwith the bandit captain.' Such was my reflection then; and the lapse of\r\na few hours has only served to strengthen the impression. You may now\r\njudge whether I have formed an unworthy attachment!\"\r\n\r\n\"She _is_ worthy of you, captain!\" exclaimed Lomellino. \"Know you who\r\nshe is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a whit,\" replied Stephano Verrina. \"I should have followed her when\r\nshe left the garden, and complimented her on her proficiency in handling\r\na poniard, but I was not so foolhardy as to stand the chance of meeting\r\nthe sbirri. Moreover, I shall speedily adopt measures to discover who\r\nand what she is; and when I present myself to her, and we compare\r\nqualifications, I do not think there can arise any obstacle to our\r\nhappiness--as lovers are accustomed to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it was _she_ who murdered the Lady Agnes?\" said Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"Have I not told you so? Signor Wagner is as innocent of that deed as\r\nthe babe unborn; but it is not for me to step forward in his behalf, and\r\nthereby criminate a lady on whom I have set my affections.\"\r\n\r\n\"That were hardly to be expected captain,\" returned Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"And all that I have now told thee thou wilt keep to thyself,\" added\r\nStephano; \"for to none else of the band do I speak so freely as to\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because no one is so devoted to his captain as I,\" rejoined Lomellino.\r\n\"And now that we are about to separate,\" added the man, as they reached\r\nthe verge of the suburb, which was then divided by a wide, open space\r\nfrom the city itself, and might even be termed a detached village--\"now\r\nthat we are about to separate, captain, allow me to ask whether the\r\naffair of Monday night still holds good?\"\r\n\r\n\"The little business at the Riverola Palace, you mean?\" said Stephano.\r\n\"Most assuredly! You and Piero will accompany me. There is little danger\r\nto be apprehended; and Antonio has given me the necessary information.\r\nCount Francisco sleeps at a great distance from the point where we must\r\nenter; and as for his sister--she is as deaf as if she had her ears\r\nsealed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about the pages, the lackeys----\"\r\n\r\n\"Antonio will give them all a sleeping draught. Everything,\" added the\r\nrobber-chief, \"is settled as cleverly as can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Antonio is your cousin, if I err not?\" said Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"Something of the kind,\" replied Stephano; \"but what is better and more\r\nbinding--we are friends. And yet, strange to say, I never was within the\r\nprecincts of the Riverola mansion until the night before last, and--more\r\nsingular still--I have never, to my knowledge, seen any members of the\r\nfamily in whose service Antonio has been so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Florence is not much honored with your presence during the\r\nday-time,\" observed Lomellino; \"and at night the great lords and\r\nhigh-born ladies who happen to be abroad, are so muffled up--the former\r\nin their cloaks, the latter in their veils----\"\r\n\r\n\"True--true; I understand all you would say, Lomellino,\" interrupted the\r\ncaptain; \"but you know how to be rather tedious at times. Here we\r\nseparate, I repair to the Arestino Palace, and you----\"\r\n\r\n\"To the cavern,\" replied Lomellino: \"where I hope to sleep better than I\r\ndid last night,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"What! a renewal of those infernal shriekings and screamings, that seem\r\nto come from the bowels of the earth?\" exclaimed the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Worse than ever,\" answered Lomellino. \"If they continue much longer, I\r\nmust abandon my office of treasure-keeper, which compels me to sleep in\r\nthe innermost room----\"\r\n\r\n\"That cannot be allowed, my worthy friend,\" interrupted the captain;\r\n\"for I should not know whom to appoint in your place. If it were not\r\nthat we should not betray our own stronghold,\" continued Stephano,\r\nemphatically, \"we would force our way into the nest of our noisy\r\nneighbors, and levy such a tribute upon them as would put them on their\r\ngood behavior for the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"The scheme is really worth consideration,\" remarked Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"We will talk more of it another time,\" said the captain. \"Good-night,\r\nLomellino. I shall not return to the cavern until very late.\"\r\n\r\nThe two banditti then separated--Lomellino striking off to the right,\r\nand Stephano Verrina pursuing his way toward the most aristocratic\r\nquarter of Florence.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the sphere of marble palaces, brilliantly lighted villas,\r\nand gay mansions, the robber chief covered his face with a black mask--a\r\nmode of disguise so common at that period, not only amongst ladies, but\r\nalso with cavaliers and nobles, that it was not considered at all\r\nsuspicious, save as a proof of amatory intrigue, with which the sbirri\r\nhad no right of interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTESS OF ARESTINO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now introduce our readers to a splendid apartment in the\r\nArestino Palace.\r\n\r\nThis room was tastefully decorated and elegantly furnished. The tapestry\r\nwas of pale blue; and the ottomans, ranged round the walls in Oriental\r\nstyle, were of rich crimson satin embroidered with gold. In the middle\r\nstood a table covered with ornaments and rich trinkets lately arrived\r\nfrom Paris--for France already began to exercise the influence of its\r\nsuperior civilization and refinement over the south of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe ceiling of that room was a master-piece of the united arts of\r\nsculpture and painting. First, the hand of the sculptor had carved it\r\ninto numerous medallions, on which the pencil of the painter had then\r\ndelineated the most remarkable scenes in early Florentine history. Round\r\nthe sides, or cornices, were beautifully sculptured in marble the heads\r\nof the principal ancestors of the Count of Arestino.\r\n\r\nIt was within half an hour of midnight, and the beautiful Giulia\r\nArestino was sitting restlessly upon an ottoman, now holding her breath\r\nto listen if a step were approaching the private door behind the\r\ntapestry--then glancing anxiously toward a clepsydra on the mantel.\r\n\r\n\"What can detain him thus? will he deceive me?\" she murmured to herself.\r\n\"Oh! how foolish--worse than foolish--mad--to confide in the promise of\r\na professed bandit! The jewels are worth a thousand times the reward I\r\nhave pledged myself to give him! wretched being that I am!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with her fair hand she drew back the dark masses of her hair that\r\nhad fallen too much over her polished brow: and on this polished brow\r\nshe pressed that fair hand, for her head ached with the intensity of\r\nmingled suspense and alarm.\r\n\r\nHer position was indeed a dangerous one as the reader is already aware.\r\nIn the infatuation of her strong, unconquerable, but not less guilty\r\nlove for the handsome spendthrift Orsini, she had pledged her diamonds\r\nto Isaachar ben Solomon for an enormous sum of money, every ducat of\r\nwhich had passed without an hour's delay into the possession of the\r\nyoung marquis.\r\n\r\nThose diamonds were the bridal gift of her fond and attached, but, alas!\r\ndeceived husband, who, being many years older than herself, studied\r\nconstantly how to afford pleasure to the wife of whom he was so proud.\r\nHe was himself an extraordinary judge of the nature, purity and value of\r\nprecious stones; and, being immensely rich, he had collected a perfect\r\nmuseum of curiosities in that particular department. In fact, it was his\r\namateur study, or, as we should say in these times, his peculiar hobby;\r\nand hence the impossibility of imposing on him by the substitution of a\r\nhired or a false set of diamonds for those which he had presented to his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, absolutely necessary to get these diamonds back from\r\nIsaachar, by fair means or foul. The fair means were to redeem them by\r\nthe payment of the loan advanced upon them; but the sum was so large\r\nthat the countess dared not make such a demand upon her husband's purse,\r\nbecause the extravagances of her lover had lately compelled her to apply\r\nso very, very frequently to the count for a replenishment of her funds.\r\nThe foul means were therefore resorted to--an old woman, who had been\r\nthe nurse of the countess in her infancy, and to whom in her distress\r\nshe applied for advice, having procured for the patrician lady the\r\nservices of Stephano Verrina, the bandit-captain.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, then, if the Countess of Arestino were a\r\nprey to the most poignant anxiety, as each successive quarter of an hour\r\npassed without bringing either Stephano or any tidings from him. Even if\r\nshe feigned illness, so as to escape the ceremony of the following day,\r\nrelief would only be temporary, for the moment she should recover, or\r\naffect to recover, her husband would again require her to accompany him\r\nto the receptions of the prince.\r\n\r\nGiulia's anguish had risen to that point at which such feelings become\r\nintolerable, and suggest the most desperate remedies--suicide,--when a\r\nlow knock behind the pale-blue arras suddenly imparted hope to her soul.\r\n\r\nHastily raising the tapestry on that side whence the sound had emanated,\r\nshe drew back the bolt of a little door communicating with a private\r\nstaircase (usually found in all Italian mansions at that period), and\r\nthe robber chief entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"Have you succeeded?\" was Giulia's rapid question.\r\n\r\n\"Your ladyship's commission has been executed,\" replied Stephano, who,\r\nwe should observe, had laid aside his black mask ere he appeared in the\r\npresence of the countess.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! now I seem to live--breathe again!\" cried Giulia, a tremendous\r\nweight suddenly removed from her mind.\r\n\r\nStephano produced the jewel-case from beneath his cloak; and as the\r\ncountess hastily took it--nay, almost snatched it from him, he\r\nendeavored to imprint a kiss upon her fair hand.\r\n\r\nDeep was the crimson glow which suffused her countenance--her neck--even\r\nall that was revealed of her bosom, as she drew haughtily back, and with\r\na sublime patrician air of offended pride.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you--thank you from the bottom of my soul, Signor Verrina,\" she\r\nsaid in another moment; for she felt how completely circumstances had\r\nplaced her in the power of the bandit-chief, and how useless it was to\r\noffend him. \"Here is your reward,\" and she presented him a heavy purse\r\nof gold.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, keep the jingling metal, lady,\" said Stephano; \"I stand in no need\r\nof it--at least for the present. The reward I crave is of a different\r\nnature, and will even cost you less than you proffer me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other recompense can I give you?\" demanded Giulia, painfully\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n\"A few lines written by thy fair hand to my dictation,\" answered\r\nStephano.\r\n\r\nGiulia cast upon him a look of profound surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Here, lady, take my tablets, for I see that your own are not at hand,\"\r\ncried the chief. \"Delay not--it grows late, and we may be interrupted.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may indeed,\" murmured Giulia, darting a rapid look at the\r\nwater-clock. \"It is within a few minutes of midnight.\"\r\n\r\nShe might have added--\"And at midnight I expect a brief visit from\r\nManuel d'Orsini, ere the return of my husband from a banquet at a\r\nfriend's villa.\" But of course this was her secret; and anxious to rid\r\nherself of the company of Stephano, she took the tablets with trembling\r\nhands and prepared to write.\r\n\r\n\"I, Giulia, Countess of Arestino,\" began the brigand, dictating to her,\r\n\"confess myself to owe Stephano Verrina a deep debt of gratitude for his\r\nkindness in recovering my diamonds from the possession of the Jew\r\nIsaachar, to whom they were pledged for a sum which I could not pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore this document?\" exclaimed the countess, looking up in a\r\nsearching manner at the robber-chief; for she had seated herself at the\r\ntable to write, and he was leaning over the back of her chair.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis my way at times,\" he answered, carelessly, \"when I perform some\r\nservice for a noble lord or a great lady, to solicit an acknowledgment\r\nof this kind in preference to gold.\" Then, sinking his voice to a low\r\nwhisper, he added with an air of deep meaning, \"Who knows but that this\r\ndocument may some day save my head?\"\r\n\r\nGiulia uttered a faint shriek, for she comprehended in a moment how\r\ncruelly she might sooner or later be compromised through that document,\r\nand how entirely she was placing herself in the bandit's power.\r\n\r\nBut Stephano's hand clutched the tablets whereon the countess had,\r\nalmost mechanically, written to his subtle dictation; and he said,\r\ncoolly: \"Fear not, lady--I must be reduced to a desperate strait indeed\r\nwhen my safety shall depend on the use I can make of this fair\r\nhandwriting.\"\r\n\r\nGiulia felt partially relieved by this assurance: and it was with\r\nill-concealed delight that she acknowledged the ceremonial bow with\r\nwhich the bandit-chief intimated his readiness to depart.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment three low and distinct knocks were heard at the\r\nlittle door behind the arras.\r\n\r\nGiulia's countenance became suffused with blushes: then, instantly\r\nrecovering her presence of mind, she said in a rapid, earnest tone, \"He\r\nwho is coming knows nothing concerning the jewels, and will be surprised\r\nto find a stranger with me. Perhaps he may even recognize you--perhaps\r\nhe knows you by sight----\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you have me do, lady?\" demanded Stephano. \"Speak, and I obey\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Conceal yourself--here--and I will soon release you.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised the tapestry on the side opposite to that by which Stephano\r\nhad entered the room; and the robber-chief hid himself in the wide\r\ninterval between the hangings in the wall.\r\n\r\nAll this had scarcely occupied a minute; and Giulia now hastened to open\r\nthe private door, which instantly gave admittance to the young,\r\nhandsome, and dissipated Marquis of Orsini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE OF WOMAN--GIULIA AND HER LOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSilence, and calmness, and moonlight were without the walls of the\r\nArestino villa; for the goddess of night shone sweetly but coldly on the\r\ncity of Florence, and asserted her empire even over the clouds that ere\r\nnow had seemed laden with storm. Nor beamed she there alone--that fair\r\nDiana; for a countless host of handmaidens--the silver-faced stars--had\r\nspread themselves over the deep purple sky; and there--there--they all\r\nshone in subdued and modest glory--those myriads of beacons floating on\r\nthe eternal waves of that far-off and silent sea!\r\n\r\nShine on, sweet regent of the night--and ye, too, silver-faced stars,\r\nwhose countenances are reflected and multiplied endlessly, as they are\r\nrocked to and fro, on the deep blue bosom of the Arno; while on the\r\nbanks of that widely-famed stream, Nature herself, as if wearied of her\r\ntoils, appears to be sleeping.\r\n\r\nWould that the soul of man could thus lie down in its night of sorrow or\r\nof racking passion, on the margin of the waters of hope, confident that\r\nthe slumber of contentment and peace will seal his eyelids, heavy with\r\nlong vigils in a world where conflicting interests need constant\r\nwatching, and that the stillness of the unfathomable depths of those\r\nwaters will impart its influence unto him!\r\n\r\nFor, oh! if calmness, silence, and moonlight prevail without the walls\r\nof the Arestino villa, yet within there be hearts agitated by passions\r\nand emotions, from which the gentle genius of slumber shrinks back\r\naghast.\r\n\r\nIn the brilliantly lighted apartment, to which we have already\r\nintroduced our readers, the Countess Giulia receives her lover, the\r\ndissipated but handsome Marquis of Orsini; the bandit-captain is\r\nconcealed behind the richly-worked tapestry; and at the door--not the\r\nlittle private one--of that room, an old man is listening; an old man\r\nwhose ashy pale countenance, clinched hands, quivering white lips, and\r\nwildly rolling eyes indicate how terrible are the feelings which agitate\r\nwithin his breast.\r\n\r\nThis old man was the Count of Arestino, one of the mightiest nobles of\r\nthe republic. Naturally his heart was good, and his disposition kind and\r\ngenerous--but, then, he was an Italian--and he was jealous! Need we say\r\nmore to account for the change which had now taken place in his usually\r\ncalm, tranquil, yet dignified, demeanor? Or shall we inform our readers\r\nthat at the banquet to which he had been invited at a friend's villa\r\nthat evening, he had overheard two young nobles, in a conversation which\r\nthe generous wine they had been too freely imbibing rendered\r\nindiscreetly loud, couple the names of Giulia Arestino, his own\r\nmuch-loved wife, and Manuel d'Orsini, in a manner which suddenly excited\r\na fearful, a blasting suspicion in his mind? Stealing away unperceived\r\nfrom the scene of revelry, the count had returned unattended to the\r\nimmediate vicinity of his mansion; and from the shade of a detached\r\nbuilding he had observed the Marquis of Orsini traverse the gardens and\r\nenter a portico leading to the private staircase communicating with that\r\nwing of the palace which contained the suit of apartments occupied by\r\nGiulia.\r\n\r\nThis was enough to strengthen the suspicion already excited in the old\r\nnobleman's mind; but not quite sufficient to confirm it. The countess\r\nhad several beautiful girls attached to her person; and the marquis\r\nmight have stooped to an intrigue with one of them. The Lord of Arestino\r\nwas therefore resolved to act with the caution of a prudent man: but he\r\nwas also prepared to avenge, in case of the worst, with the spirit of an\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\nHe hurried round to the principal entrance of his palace, and gave some\r\nbrief but energetic instructions to a faithful valet, who instantly\r\ndeparted to execute them. The count then ascended the marble staircase,\r\ntraversed the corridors leading toward his lady's apartments, and placed\r\nhimself against the door of that one wherein Giulia had already received\r\nher lover.\r\n\r\nThus, while silence, and calmness, and moonlight reign without--yet\r\nwithin the walls of the Arestino mansion a storm has gathered, to\r\nexplode fearfully. And all through the unlawful, but not less ardent,\r\nlove of Giulia for the spendthrift Marquis of Orsini!\r\n\r\nSober-minded men, philosophic reasoners, persons of business-habits,\r\nstern moralists--all these may ridicule the poet or the novelist who\r\nmakes Love his everlasting theme; they may hug themselves, in the apathy\r\nof their own cold hearts, with the belief that all the attributes of the\r\npassion have been immensely exaggerated; but they are in error, deeply,\r\nprofoundly, indisputably in error. For Love, in its various phases,\r\namong which are Jealousy, Suspicion, Infidelity, Rivalry, and Revenge,\r\nhas agitated the world from time immemorial--has overthrown empires, has\r\nengendered exterminating wars, and has extended its despotic sway alike\r\nover the gorgeous city of a consummate civilization, and the miserable\r\nwigwam of a heathen barbarism! Who, then, can wonder--if the theme of\r\nLove be universal--that it should have evoked the rude and iron\r\neloquence of the Scandinavian Scald as well as the soft and witching\r\npoesy of the bards of more genial climes, or that its praises or its\r\nsorrows should be sung on the banks of the Arno, the Seine, or the\r\nThames, as well as amidst the pathless forests of America, or the\r\nburning sands of Africa, or in the far-off islands of the Southern Seas.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! it is thou, O woman! who art called on to make the most cruel\r\nsacrifices at the altar of this imperious deity--love! If thou lovest\r\nhonorably, 'tis well; but if thou lovest unlawfully how wretched is thy\r\nfate! The lover, for whose sake thou hast forgotten thy duties as a\r\nwife, has sacrificed nothing to thee, whilst thou hast sacrificed\r\neverything to him. Let the _amour_ be discovered, and who suffers? Thou!\r\nHe loses not caste, station, name, nor honor;--thou art suddenly robbed\r\nof all these! The gilded saloons of fashion throw open their doors to\r\nthe seducer; but bars of adamant defend that entrance against the\r\nseduced. For his sake thou risketh contumely, shame, reviling, scorn,\r\nand the lingering death of a breaking heart,--for _thee_ he would not\r\nrisk one millionth part of all that! Shouldst thou be starving, say to\r\nhim, \"Go forth and steal to give me bread; dare the dishonor of the\r\ndeed, and make the sacrifice of thy good name for me. Or go and forge,\r\nor swindle, or lie foully, so that thou bringest me bread; for have I\r\nnot dared dishonor, made the sacrifice of my good name, and done as\r\nmuch, ay, far more than all that, for thee?\"\r\n\r\nShouldst thou, poor, seduced, weak one, address thy seducer thus, he\r\nwill look upon thee as a fiend-like tempter--he will rush from thy\r\nsight--he will never see thee more; his love will be suddenly converted\r\ninto hatred! Yes, man demands that woman should dishonor herself for\r\n_his_ sake; but he will not allow a speck to appear upon what he calls\r\n_his_ good name--no, not to save that poor, confiding, lost creature\r\nfrom the lowest depths and dregs of penury into which her frailty may\r\nhave plunged her!\r\n\r\nSuch is the selfishness of man! Where is his chivalry?\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the Arestino Palace.\r\n\r\nThe moment Manuel d'Orsini entered the apartment by means of the private\r\ndoor, he embraced Giulia with a fondness which was more than half\r\naffected--at least on that occasion--and she herself returned the kiss\r\nless warmly than usual--but this was because she was constrained and\r\nembarrassed by the presence of the bandit-captain, who was concealed\r\nbehind the tapestry.\r\n\r\n\"You appear cool--distant, Giulia,\" said Manuel, casting upon her an\r\ninquiring glance.\r\n\r\n\"And you either love me less, or you have something on your mind,\"\r\nreturned the countess, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"In the first instance you are wrong--in the second you are right, my\r\nwell-beloved,\" answered the marquis. \"But tell me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak lower, Manuel--we may be overheard. Some of my dependents are in\r\nthe adjacent room, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you wish me to depart as soon as possible, no doubt?\" said the\r\nmarquis, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Manuel--how can you reproach me thus?\" asked Giulia, in a voice\r\nscarcely above a whisper; for that woman who dared be unfaithful to her\r\nhusband revolted from the thought that a coarse-minded bandit should be\r\nin a position to overhear her conversation with her lover:--\"how can you\r\nreproach me thus, Manuel?\" she repeated;--\"have I not given thee all the\r\nproofs of tenderest love which woman can bestow? Have I not risked\r\neverything for thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not reproach you, Giulia,\" he replied, pressing his hand to his\r\nbrow, \"but I am unhappy--miserable!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he flung himself upon the nearest ottoman.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what has occurred to distract thee thus?\" exclaimed the countess,\r\nforgetting the presence of Stephano Verrina in the all-absorbing\r\ninterest of her lover's evident grief.\r\n\r\n\"Am I ever to find thee oppressed with care--thee, who art so young--and\r\nso gloriously handsome?\" she added, her voice suddenly sinking to a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\nManuel gazed for a few moments, without speaking, on the countenance of\r\nhis mistress as she leant over him: then, in a deep, hollow tone--a tone\r\nthe despair of which was too real and natural to be in the slightest\r\ndegree affected, he said, \"Giulia, I am a wretch,--unworthy of all this\r\nsweet love of thine!--I have broken the solemn vow which I pledged\r\nthee--I have violated my oath----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Manuel!\" ejaculated the countess, still forgetting the presence of\r\nthe bandit: \"thou hast----\"\r\n\r\n\"Gambled once more--and lost!\" cried the marquis wildly. \"And the sum\r\nthat I am bound in honor to pay on Monday--by noon, is nearly equal in\r\namount to that which thy generosity lent me the other day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin aid you, my unhappy Manuel!\" said Giulia.\r\n\r\n\"For thou canst not?\" exclaimed the young noble, with a profound sigh.\r\n\"Oh! I am well aware that I have no claim upon thee----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! wherefore that reproach?--for a reproach it is!\" interrupted the\r\ncountess. \"No claim on me! Hast thou not my heart? and in giving thee\r\nthat, Manuel, I laid at thy feet a poor offering, which, though so poor,\r\nyet absorbs all others of which I may dispose! Do not reproach me,\r\nManuel--for I would lay down my life to save thy soul from pain, or thy\r\nname from dishonor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now art thou my own Giulia!\" cried the marquis, pressing her hand to\r\nhis lips. \"An accursed fatality seems to hang over me! This habit of\r\ngaming entraps me as the wine cup fascinates the bibber who would fain\r\navoid it, but cannot. Listen to me for one moment, Giulia. In the public\r\ncasino--which, as thou well knowest, is a place of resort where fortunes\r\nare lost and won in an hour--ay, sometimes in a minute--I have met a man\r\nwhose attire is good, and whose purse is well filled, but whose\r\ncountenance I like as little as I should that of the captain of the\r\nsbirri, or his lieutenant, if I had committed a crime. This individual\r\nof whom I speak--for I know not his name--was the favored votary of Dame\r\nFortune who won of me that sum which thy kindness, Giulia, alone enabled\r\nme to pay but a few days past. And now am I a second time this man's\r\ndebtor. An hour ago he entered the casino; he stayed but for ten\r\nminutes--and in that time----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Manuel, is not this conduct of thine something bordering on\r\nmadness?\" interrupted the countess. \"And if thou art thus wedded to that\r\nfatal habit, how canst thou find room in thy heart for a single gleam of\r\naffection for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now dost thou reproach me in thy turn, Giulia!\" exclaimed the young\r\nmarquis. \"But believe me, my angel,\" he continued, exerting all his\r\npowers to bend her to his purpose,--\"believe me when I declare--oh! most\r\nsolemnly declare, by all that I put faith in, and by all I hope for\r\nhereafter--that could I be relieved from this embarrassment--extricated\r\nfrom this difficulty----\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens! how can it be done?\" interrupted the countess, casting her\r\neyes wildly round; for the time was passing--she suddenly remembered\r\nthat the bandit was still concealed in the room--and then, her husband\r\nmight return earlier than was expected.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if you despair of the means, Giulia,\" said the marquis, \"I must fly\r\nfrom Florence--I must exile myself forever from the city of my birth,\r\nand which is still more endeared to me because,\" he added, sinking his\r\nvoice to a tender tone,--\"because, my well-beloved, it contains thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Manuel--you must not quit Florence and leave a dishonored name\r\nbehind thee!\" exclaimed this lovely woman, who was thus sublimely\r\ncareful of the reputation of him for whom she had so long compromised\r\nher own. \"What can be done? would that I had the means to raise this\r\nsum----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is with shame that I suggest----\" said Manuel.\r\n\r\n\"What? Speak--speak! The means?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thy jewels, dearest--thy diamonds----\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens! if you did but know all!\" cried Giulia, almost\r\nfrantically. \"These diamonds were pledged to the Jew Isaachar ben\r\nSolomon, to raise the sum with which thy last debt was paid, Manuel;\r\nand--but forgive me if I did not tell thee all this before--not half an\r\nhour has elapsed since----\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped short; for she knew that the bandit overheard every syllable\r\nshe uttered.\r\n\r\nNor had she time, even if she possessed the power, to continue her most\r\npainful explanation; for scarcely had she thus paused abruptly, when the\r\ndoor burst open, and the Count of Arestino stood in the presence of the\r\nguilty pair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE INJURED HUSBAND--THE GUILTY WIFE--AND THE INSOLENT LOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fury of heart and agony of mind, rushed the old lord into that\r\napartment. Oh! how had he even been able to restrain himself so long,\r\nwhile listening at the door? It was that the conversation between his\r\nwife and the marquis had, as the reader is aware, been carried on in so\r\nlow a tone--especially on the side of the countess, that he had not been\r\nable to gather sufficient to place beyond all doubt the guilt of that\r\nfair creature; and even in the midst of his Italian ire, he had clung to\r\nthe hope that she might have been imprudent--but not culpable, as yet!\r\n\r\nOh! in this case, how gladly would that old lord have forgiven the past,\r\non condition of complete reformation for the future! He would have\r\nremoved his young wife afar from the scene of temptation--to a distant\r\nestate which he possessed; and there by gentle remonstrances and\r\nredoubled attention, he would have sought to bind her to him by the\r\nlinks of gratitude and respect, if not by those of love.\r\n\r\nBut this dream--so honorable to that old man's heart--was not to be\r\nrealized; for scarcely was it conceived, when the discourse of the\r\nyouthful pair turned upon the diamonds--those diamonds which he had\r\ngiven her on the bridal day!\r\n\r\nGiulia spoke clearly and plainly enough _then_--in spite of the presence\r\nof the bandit in that chamber; for she was about to explain to her lover\r\nhow willingly she would comply with his suggestion to raise upon the\r\njewels the sum he again required--a readiness on her part which might be\r\ncorroborated by the fact that she had already once had recourse to this\r\nexpedient, and for _him_--but she dared not adopt the same course again,\r\nas her husband might detect the absence of the valuables ere she could\r\nobtain funds to redeem them.\r\n\r\nWhen she acknowledged to her lover that \"these diamonds were pledged to\r\nthe Jew Isaachar ben Solomon, to raise the sum with which his last debt\r\nwas paid,\" it flashed to the old nobleman's mind that his wife had\r\nexhibited some little confusion when he had spoken to her a day or two\r\npreviously concerning her jewels: and now it was clear that they had\r\nbeen used as the means to supply the extravagances of an unprincipled\r\nspendthrift. How could he any longer cling to the hope that Giulia was\r\nimprudent only, and not guilty? Must she not be guilty, to have made so\r\nlarge a sacrifice and run so great a risk for the sake of the Marquis of\r\nOrsini?\r\n\r\nIt was under the influence of these excited feelings that the Count of\r\nArestino burst into the room.\r\n\r\nFortunately--so far as outward appearance went--there was nothing more\r\nto confirm the old nobleman's suspicions; the youthful pair were not\r\nlocked in each other's arms; their hands were not even joined. Manuel\r\nwas seated on the sofa, and Giulia was standing at a short distance from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBut conscious guilt elicited a faint scream from her lips; and the\r\nboiling blood, after rushing to her countenance, seemed to ebb away as\r\nrapidly again--leaving her beauteous face as pale as marble; while she\r\nclung to the mantel-piece for support.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad that your lordship is returned,\" said the marquis, rising\r\nfrom his seat and advancing toward the count in a manner so insolently\r\ncool and apparently self-possessed, that Giulia was not only astonished\r\nbut felt her courage suddenly revive: \"I was determined--however\r\nuncourteous the intrusion and unseemly the hour--to await your\r\nlordship's coming; and as her ladyship assured me that you would not\r\ntarry late----\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord marquis,\" interrupted the old nobleman, who was himself so\r\ntaken by surprise at this unembarrassed mode of address, that he began\r\nto fancy his ears must have deceived him and his suspicions beguiled\r\nhim; \"on what business could you possibly have needed my services at\r\nthis late hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will explain myself,\" returned Orsini, who was a perfect adept in the\r\nart of dissimulation, and who, never losing his presence of mind,\r\nembraced at a glance the whole danger of Giulia's position and his own,\r\nand the probability that their conversation might have been overheard;\r\n\"I was explaining to her ladyship the temporary embarrassment under\r\nwhich I lay, and from which I hoped that your friendship might probably\r\nrelease me----\"\r\n\r\n\"And her ladyship spoke of her diamonds--did she not?\" demanded the\r\ncount, addressing himself to the marquis, but fixing a keen and\r\npenetrating glance on Giulia.\r\n\r\n\"Her ladyship was remonstrating with me on my extravagancies,\" hastily\r\nreplied the marquis, \"and was repeating to me--I must say in a manner\r\ntoo impressive to be agreeable--the words which my own sister had used\r\nto me a few days ago, when explaining, as her motive for refusing me the\r\nsuccor which I needed, that she actually had been compelled to pledge\r\nher diamonds----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! they were your sister's diamonds that were pledged to Isaachar the\r\nJew?\" said the count, half ironically and half in doubt; for he was\r\nfairly bewildered by the matchless impudence of the young marquis.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord--my dear sister, who, alas! is ruining herself to supply\r\nme with the means of maintaining my rank. And as my sister and her\r\nladyship, the countess, are on the most friendly terms, as you are well\r\naware, it is not surprising if she should have communicated the secret\r\nof the diamonds to her ladyship, and also beg her ladyship to\r\nremonstrate with me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lord,\" interrupted the count impatiently, \"your own private\r\naffairs have no particular interest for me--at this moment; and as for\r\nany business on which you may wish to speak to me, I shall be pleased if\r\nyou postpone it till to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship's wishes are commands with me,\" said Manuel, with a\r\npolite salutation. And having made a low bow to Giulia, he quitted the\r\nroom--not by the private door, be it well understood, but by that which\r\nhad ere now admitted the Count of Arestino.\r\n\r\nThe moment the door had closed behind the Marquis of Orsini, the count\r\napproached his wife, and said in a cold, severe manner: \"Your ladyship\r\nreceives visitors at a late hour.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced as he spoke toward the dial of the clepsydra, and Giulia\r\nfollowed his look in the same direction; it was half an hour after\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\"The marquis explained to your lordship, or partially so, the motive of\r\nhis importunate visit,\" said Giulia, endeavoring to appear calm and\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\n\"The marquis is an unworthy--reckless--unprincipled young man,\"\r\nexclaimed the count, fixing a stern, searching gaze upon Giulia's\r\ncountenance, as if with the iron of his words he would probe the depths\r\nof her soul. \"He is a confirmed gamester--overwhelmed with debts--and\r\nhas tarnished, by his profligacy, the proud name that he bears. Even the\r\nfriendship which existed for many, many years between his deceased\r\nfather and myself, shall no longer induce me to receive at this house a\r\nyoung man whose reputation is all but tainted, even in a city of\r\ndissipation and debauchery, such as, alas! the once glorious Florence\r\nhas become! For his immorality is not confined to gaming and wanton\r\nextravagance,\" continued the count, his glance becoming more keen, as\r\nhis words fell like drops of molten lead upon the heart of Giulia; \"but\r\nhis numerous intrigues amongst women--his perfidy to those confiding and\r\ndeceived fair ones----\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, my lord,\" said the countess, vainly endeavoring to subdue the\r\nwrithings of torture which this language excited,--\"surely the Marquis\r\nd'Orsini is wronged by the breath of scandal?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Giulia, he is an unprincipled spendthrift,\" returned the count, who\r\nnever once took his eyes off his wife's countenance while he was\r\nspeaking:--\"an unprincipled spendthrift,\" he added emphatically,--\"a man\r\nlost to all sense of honor--a ruined gamester--a heartless seducer--a\r\nshame, a blot, a stigma upon the aristocracy of Florence;--and now that\r\nyou are acquainted with his real character, you will recognize the\r\nprudence of the step which I shall take to-morrow--that is, to inform\r\nhim that henceforth the Count and Countess of Arestino must decline to\r\nreceive him again at their villa. What think you, Giulia?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship is the master to command, and it is my duty to obey,\"\r\nanswered the countess; but her voice was hoarse and thick, the acutest\r\nanguish was rending her soul, and its intensity almost choked her\r\nutterance.\r\n\r\n\"She is guilty!\" thought the count within himself; and to subdue an\r\nabrupt explosion of his rage, until he had put the last and most certain\r\ntest to his lady's faith, he walked twice up and down the room; then,\r\nfeeling that he had recovered his powers of self-control, he said,\r\n\"To-morrow, Giulia, is the reception day of his highness the duke, and I\r\nhope thou hast made suitable preparations to accompany me in the manner\r\nbecoming the wife of the Count of Arestino.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can your lordship suppose for an instant that I should appear in the\r\nducal presence otherwise than is meet and fitting for her who has the\r\nhonor to bear your name?\" said Giulia, partially recovering her presence\r\nof mind, as the conversation appeared to have taken a turn no longer\r\npainful to her feelings--for, oh! cannot the reader conceive the\r\nanguish, the mortal anguish, she had ere now endured when her husband\r\nwas heaping ashes on the reputation of her lover!\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose that your ladyship will neglect the preparations due\r\nto your rank and to that name which you esteem it an honor to bear, and\r\nwhich no living being should _dishonor_ with impunity!\"\r\n\r\nGiulia quailed--writhed beneath the searching glance which now literally\r\nglared upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" continued the count, \"I was fearful you might have\r\nforgotten that to-morrow is the reception day. And while I think of it,\r\npermit me to examine your diamonds for a few minutes--to convince myself\r\nthat the settings are in good order, as you know,\" he added, with a\r\nstrange, unearthly kind of laugh, \"that I am skilled in the jewelers'\r\ncraft.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man paused; but he thought within himself, \"Now what subterfuge\r\ncan she invent if my suspicions be really true, and if my ears did not\r\nere now deceive me?\"\r\n\r\nHow profound then was his astonishment, when Giulia, with the calm and\r\ntranquil demeanor which innocence usually wears, but with the least,\r\nleast curl of the upper lip, as if in haughty triumph, leisurely and\r\ndeliberately drew the jewel-case from beneath the cushion of the ottoman\r\nwhereon she was seated, and, handing it to him, said, \"Your lordship\r\nperceives that I had not forgotten the reception which his highness\r\nholds to-morrow, since I ere now brought my diamonds hither to select\r\nthose which it is my intention to wear.\"\r\n\r\nThe count could have pressed her hand as he took the case in his own--he\r\ncould have fallen at her feet and demanded pardon for the suspicions\r\nwhich he had entertained, for it now seemed certain beyond all\r\npossibility of doubt, that the explanation volunteered by the marquis\r\nwas a true one--yes, he could have humbled himself in her presence--but\r\nhis Italian pride intervened, and he proceeded to examine the diamonds\r\nwith no other view than to gain time to reflect how he should account\r\nfor the abrupt manner in which he had entered the room ere now, and for\r\nthe chilling behavior he had maintained toward his wife.\r\n\r\nOn her side Giulia, relieved of a fearful weight of apprehension, was\r\nonly anxious for this scene to have a speedy termination, that she might\r\nrelease the robber-captain from his imprisonment behind the tapestry.\r\n\r\nThree or four minutes of profound silence now ensued.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the count started, and uttered an ejaculation of mingled\r\nrage and surprise.\r\n\r\nGiulia's blood ran cold to her very heart's core, she scarcely knew why.\r\n\r\nThe suspense was not, however, long--though most painful; for, dashing\r\nthe jewel-case with its contents upon the table, the old nobleman\r\napproached her with quivering lips and a countenance ghastly white,\r\nexclaiming, \"Vile woman! thinkest thou to impose upon me thus? The\r\ndiamonds I gave thee are gone--the stones set in their place are\r\ncounterfeit!\"\r\n\r\nGiulia gazed up toward her husband's countenance for a few moments in a\r\nmanner expressive of blank despair; then falling on her knees before\r\nhim, clasping her hands together, she screamed frantically, \"Pardon!\r\npardon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then it is all indeed too true!\" murmured the unhappy nobleman,\r\nstaggering as if with a blow: but, recovering his balance, he stamped\r\nhis foot resolutely upon the floor, and drawing himself up to his full\r\nheight, while he half averted his eyes from his kneeling wife, he\r\nexclaimed: \"Lost--guilty--abandoned woman, how canst thou implore pardon\r\nat my hands? For pardon is mercy, and what mercy hast thou shown to me?\r\nGiulia, I am descended from an old and mighty race, and tradition\r\naffords no room to believe that any one who has borne the name of\r\nArestino has dishonored it--until now! Oh! fool--dotard--idiot that I\r\nwas to think that a young girl could love an aged man like me! For old\r\nage is a weed, which, when twined round the plant of love, becomes like\r\nthe deadly nightshade, and robs the rose-bush of its health! Alas! alas!\r\nI thought that in my declining years, I should have one to cheer me, one\r\nwho might respect me, if she could not love me--one who would manifest\r\nsome gratitude for the proud position I have given her--and the\r\nboundless wealth that it would have been my joy to leave her. And now\r\nthat hope is gone--withered--crushed--blighted, woman, by thy perfidy!\r\nOh! wherefore did you accompany the old man to the altar, if only to\r\ndeceive him? Wherefore did you consent to become his bride, if but to\r\nplunge him into the depth of misery? You weep! Ah! weep on; and all\r\nthose tears, be they even so scalding as to make seams on that too fair\r\nface, cannot wipe away the stain which is now affixed to the haughty\r\nname of Arestino! Weep on, Giulia; but thy tears cannot move me now!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the old lord's tone changed suddenly from the deep, touching pathos\r\nof tremulousness to a stern, fixed, cold severity, which stifled the\r\ngerms of hope that had taken birth in the heart of his guilty wife.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! mercy!\" she shrieked, endeavoring to grasp his hand.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" thundered the Count of Arestino; and he rang violently a silver\r\nbell which stood upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin, what will become of me? For what fate am I destined?\"\r\nimplored Giulia, frantically.\r\n\r\nThe old nobleman approached her, gazed on her sternly for nearly a\r\nminute, then bending down said, in a hollow, sepulchral tone:\r\n\r\n\"Thou art doomed to eternal seclusion in the convent of the Carmelites!\"\r\n\r\nHe then turned hastily round and advanced to the door, to which steps\r\nwere already distinctly heard drawing near in the corridor.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Giulia seemed paralyzed by the dreadful announcement that\r\nhad been made to her; but suddenly a ray of hope flashed on her mind,\r\nand darting toward that part of the tapestry behind which the robber was\r\nconcealed, she said, in a low and rapid tone:\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast heard the fate that awaits me. I charge thee to seek Manuel\r\nd'Orsini, and let him know all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, lady; you shall be saved!\" answered Stephano, in a scarcely\r\naudible but yet profoundly emphatic whisper.\r\n\r\nShe had only just time to turn away when the count's faithful valet,\r\naccompanied by three nuns, wearing their black veils over their faces,\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterward the Carmelite Convent received another inmate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE MARQUIS OF ORSINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the Arestino palace, the Marquis of Orsini suddenly lost\r\nthat bold, insolent, self-sufficient air with which he had endeavored to\r\ndeceive the venerable count, whose wife he had dishonored.\r\n\r\nFor dishonor now menaced _him_!\r\n\r\nWhere could he raise the sum necessary to liquidate the debt which he\r\nhad contracted with the stranger at the Casino, or gaming-house? And as\r\nthe person to whom he found himself thus indebted _was_ a stranger--a\r\ntotal stranger to him, he had no apology to offer for a delay in the\r\npayment of the money due.\r\n\r\n\"Perdition!\" he exclaimed aloud, as he issued rapidly from the grounds\r\nattached to the Arestino mansion; \"is there no alternative save flight?\r\nGiulia cannot assist me--her jewels are gone, they are pledged to the\r\nJew Isaachar--she was telling me so when the count broke in upon us.\r\nWhat course can I adopt? what plan pursue? Shall the name of Orsini be\r\ndishonored--that proud name which for three centuries has been\r\nmaintained spotless? No, no--this must not be!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in a state of most painful excitement--so painful, indeed, that it\r\namounted almost to a physical agony--the marquis hastened rapidly\r\nthrough the mazes of the sleeping city, reckless whither he was going,\r\nbut experiencing no inclination to repair to his own abode.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the diamonds of his mistress having been pledged to Isaachar\r\nben Solomon was uppermost in his mind: for the reader must remember that\r\nhe was unaware of the circumstance of their restoration to Giulia--as it\r\nwas at the moment when she was about to give him this explanation that\r\nthe old Lord of Arestino had interrupted their discourse.\r\n\r\nThe diamonds, then, constituted the pivot on which his thoughts now\r\nrevolved. They seemed to shine like stars amidst the deep haze which\r\nhung upon his mind. Could he not possess himself of them? The name of\r\nOrsini would be dishonored if the gambling debt were not paid; and one\r\nbold--one desperate step might supply him with the means to save himself\r\nfrom the impending ruin--the imminent disgrace.\r\n\r\nBut as the thoughts encouraged by those simple words--\"the\r\ndiamonds\"--assumed a more palpable shape in his imagination, he shrank\r\nback dismayed from the deed which they suggested: for gamester,\r\ndebauchee, spendthrift as he was, he had never yet perpetrated an act\r\nthat could be termed a crime. The seduction of the Countess of Arestino\r\nwas not a crime in his estimation--oh! no, because man may seduce, and\r\nyet may not be dishonored in the eyes of the world. It is his victim, or\r\nthe partner of his guilty pleasure, only, who is dishonored. Such is the\r\nlaw written in society's conventional code. Vile, detestable, unjust\r\nlaw!\r\n\r\nTo weigh and balance the reasons for or against the perpetration of a\r\ncrime, to pause only for an instant to reflect whether the deed shall or\r\nshall not be done--this is to yield at once to the temptation. The\r\ndesperate man who hovers hesitatingly between right and wrong,\r\ninvariably adopts the latter course.\r\n\r\nAnd Manuel of Orsini was not an exception to the general rule.\r\n\r\nSilence, and calmness, and moonlight were still spread over the City of\r\nFlowers, while the marquis pursued the path leading to the suburb of\r\nAlla Droce. And the silver-faced stars shone on--shone on, brightly and\r\nsweetly, as the young nobleman knocked at the well-protected door of\r\nIsaachar ben Solomon.\r\n\r\nFor a long time his summons remained unanswered; and he repeated it\r\nseveral times ere it received the slightest attention.\r\n\r\nAt last a casement was opened slowly on the upper story; and the Jew\r\ndemanded who sought admittance at that hour.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis I, the Marquis of Orsini!\" exclaimed the nobleman.\r\n\r\n\"A thousand pardons, my lord; I come directly,\" answered the Jew, not\r\ndaring to offend a scion of the omnipotent aristocracy of Florence, yet\r\nfilled with some misgivings, the more painful because they were so vague\r\nand undefined.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Manuel was admitted into the abode of Isaachar ben\r\nSolomon, who carefully barred and bolted the door again, ere he even\r\nthought of alleviating his acute suspense by inquiring the nobleman's\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"Deign to enter this humble apartment, my lord,\" said the Jew, at\r\nlength, as he conducted the marquis into the same room where he had a\r\nfew hours previously received the bandit-captain.\r\n\r\n\"Isaachar,\" exclaimed Manuel, flinging himself upon a seat, \"you behold\r\na desperate man before you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my lord, what can a poor, aged, and obscure individual like\r\nmyself do to assist so great and powerful a noble as your lordship?\"\r\nsaid the Jew in a trembling tone.\r\n\r\n\"What can you do?\" repeated the marquis: \"much--everything, old man! But\r\nlisten patiently, for a few moments only. A noble lady's fame, honor,\r\nreputation are at stake; and I am the guilty, unhappy cause of the\r\ndanger that threatens her. To minister to my necessities she has pledged\r\nher jewels----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, my lord--I understand,\" said Isaachar, trembling from head to\r\nfoot, \"'tis a plan by no means unusual nowadays in Florence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her husband suspects the fact, and has commanded her to produce her\r\ndiamonds to-morrow----\"\r\n\r\n\"Her diamonds!\" articulated the Jew in a stifling tone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, _her diamonds_,\" exclaimed Manuel emphatically; \"and they are in\r\nyour possession. Now do you understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--my lord----\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us not waste time in idle words, Isaachar,\" cried the marquis.\r\n\"Will you permit this scandal to be discovered, and involve the Countess\r\nof Arestino--myself--ay, and _yourself_, old man, in danger, and perhaps\r\nruin? Perhaps, did I say? Nay, that ruin is certain to fall upon\r\n_her_--certain also to overwhelm _you_--for the Count of Arestino is a\r\ncouncilor of state, and,\" added Manuel, with slow, measured emphasis,\r\n\"_the dungeons of the inquisition open at his commands_ to receive the\r\nheretic or the Jew!\"\r\n\r\nIsaachar ben Solomon vainly endeavored to reply; fear choked his\r\nutterance; and he sank trembling and faint upon a low ottoman, where he\r\nsat, the picture of dumb despair.\r\n\r\n\"Ruin, then, awaits the countess, ruin, and the inquisition yawn to\r\ningulf you; and dishonor in having involved that noble lady in such a\r\nlabyrinth of perils attends upon me,\" continued Orsini, perceiving that\r\nhis dark threats had produced the effect which he desired.\r\n\r\n\"My lord--my lord,\" gasped the unfortunate Israelite, who could not\r\nclose his eyes against the truth, the terrible truth of the prospect\r\nsubmitted to his contemplation.\r\n\r\n\"It is for you to decide against the ruin of one, two, three persons,\r\nyourself being he who will, if possible, suffer most,\" resumed the\r\nmarquis, impressively--\"it is, I say, for you to decide between exposure\r\nand the inquisition on one hand, and the surrender of those paltry\r\ndiamonds on the other!\"\r\n\r\n\"The diamonds, the diamonds, they are gone!\" exclaimed the Jew, his\r\nvoice becoming almost frantic with the wild hope that suddenly struck\r\nhim of being able to shift the danger from his own head to that of\r\nanother. \"The captain of banditti, Stephano Verrina, was here a few\r\nhours ago, here, in this very room, and he sat where your lordship now\r\nsits!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well?\" cried the marquis, impatiently; for his heart began to\r\ngrow sick with the fear of disappointment in respect to his plan of\r\nobtaining the diamonds of his mistress.\r\n\r\n\"And Stephano Verrina took them from me--basely, vilely, wrenched them\r\nas it were from my grasp!\" continued the Jew.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis false! a miserable subterfuge on your part!\" ejaculated the\r\nmarquis, starting from his seat and striding in a menacing manner toward\r\nIsaachar ben Solomon.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis true!--I will give your lordship the proof!\" cried the Jew: and\r\nManuel fell back a few paces. \"Stephano came and told me all. He said\r\nthat the countess had pledged her jewels for the sake of her lover--of\r\nyou, my lord--you, the Marquis of Orsini. 'Twas to pay a gambling debt\r\nwhich your lordship had contracted; and that debt was paid within an\r\nhour or two from the moment when the sum was advanced on the diamonds.\r\nMoreover,\" continued Isaachar, still speaking in a rapid, excited\r\ntone--\"moreover, Stephano was hired by the countess to regain them from\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n\"Liar!\" thundered the marquis, again rushing toward the defenseless old\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"Patience, my lord--patience for an instant--and you will see that I am\r\nno utterer of base falsehoods. The robber-captain examined the diamonds\r\ncarefully--yes, most carefully--and, while occupied in the scrutiny, he\r\nlet drop expressions which convinced me that he was hired by the\r\ncountess. 'The inventory is complete,' he said, 'just as it was\r\ndescribed to me by her ladyship. You are a worthy man, Isaachar,' he\r\nadded; 'you will have restored tranquillity to the mind of this\r\nbeautiful countess; and she will be enabled to appear at court to-morrow\r\nwith her husband.' Now does your lordship believe me?\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis was staggered; for several minutes he made no answer. Was it\r\npossible that the Countess of Arestino could have employed the dreaded\r\nchieftain of the Florentine banditti to wrest her diamonds from the\r\npossession of Isaachar? or had the Jew invented the tale for an obvious\r\npurpose? The latter alternative scarcely seemed feasible. How could\r\nIsaachar have learned that the sum raised was for the payment of a\r\ngambling debt? Giulia would not have told him so. Again, how had he\r\nlearned that this debt had been paid within an hour or two after the\r\nmoney was procured? and how had he ascertained that the countess had\r\nactually required her diamonds to accompany her husband the count?\r\n\r\n\"Perdition!\" ejaculated Orsini, bewildered by conflicting ideas,\r\nsuspicions, and alarms: and he paced the room with agitated steps.\r\n\r\nNearly a quarter of a hour elapsed--the silence being occasionally\r\nbroken by some question which the marquis put to the Jew, and to which\r\nthe latter had his reply ready. And each question thus put, and every\r\nanswer thus given, only served to corroborate Isaachar's tale, and\r\nbanish hope still further from the breast of the ruined nobleman.\r\n\r\nAt length the latter stopped short--hesitated for a few moments, as if\r\nwrestling with some idea or scheme that had taken possession of his\r\nmind;--then turning abruptly toward the Jew, he said in a deep, hollow\r\ntone--\"Isaachar, I need gold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gold--gold, my lord!\" ejaculated the Jew, all his fears returning;\r\n\"surely--surely, my lord, her ladyship will supply you with----\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool--dolt!\" cried the marquis, terribly excited; \"do you not see that\r\nshe herself is menaced with ruin--that the villain Stephano must have\r\nkept the diamonds for himself? that is, granting your tale to be\r\ntrue----\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was an authoritative knock at the house-door.\r\n\r\n\"This is Stephano Verrina himself!\" exclaimed the Jew. \"I know his\r\nmanner of knocking with the rude handle of his sword. What can he want?\r\nWhat will become of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stephano Verrina, say you?\" cried the marquis, hastily. \"Then admit him\r\nby all means; and the possession of the diamonds of the countess shall\r\nbe disputed between him and me at the sword's point.\"\r\n\r\nManuel d'Orsini was naturally brave, and the desperate position in which\r\nhe was placed, rendered his tone and bearing so resolute--so determined,\r\nthat Isaachar feared lest blood should be shed in his dwelling.\r\n\r\n\"My lord--my lord,\" he said in an imploring tone, \"depart, or conceal\r\nyourself----\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence, signor!\" ejaculated the marquis; \"and hasten to admit the\r\ncaptain of banditti. I have heard much of Stephano Verrina, and would\r\nfain behold this formidable chieftain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Jew proceeded, with trembling limbs and ghastly countenance, to obey\r\nthe orders of the marquis; and in a few moments he returned to the room,\r\naccompanied by Stephano Verrina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA COMBAT--THE DESPISED AND PERSECUTED ISRAELITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaachar had taken away the lamp with him to give admission to the\r\nbandit, and the marquis had remained for a few instants in the dark.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jew reappeared, bearing the light, Orsini's first and natural\r\nimpulse was to cast a rapid, searching glance at the brigand captain. At\r\nthe same moment this individual burst into a loud, coarse, joyous laugh;\r\nand the marquis, to his profound surprise, recognized in Stephano\r\nVerrina the person with whom he had twice played so unsuccessfully at\r\nthe gambling house.\r\n\r\n\"Good, my lord!\" exclaimed Verrina, flinging himself upon the ottoman\r\nwhich the Jew had ere now occupied; \"there is not in all Florence a man\r\nwhom I would rather have encountered than yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are somewhat pressing for the trifle--the miserable trifle in which\r\nI am indebted to you, signor,\" said the marquis haughtily; \"seeing that\r\nscarce two hours have elapsed since I lost the amount at the casino.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw! who alluded to the affair, save yourself?\" cried Stephano. \"It\r\nwas for another motive----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and I also wished to see Signor Stephano Verrina for another\r\nmotive,\" exclaimed Manuel emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then you know me, my lord?\" said the bandit. \"And yet methought I\r\nwas a stranger to you, although you were none to me at the casino.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were a stranger until now,\" continued Orsini; \"but Isaachar knew by\r\nthe knock which you dealt so lustily on his door, who was his visitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your lordship was desirous to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much so. I believe you expressed a similar wish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely, my lord,\" returned Stephano. \"But as you hold the higher\r\nrank in the world, precedence in the way of explanation belongs to your\r\nlordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is rather an explanation which I seek, than one which I have to\r\ngive,\" rejoined Manuel, in a cold but resolute manner. \"In a word, my\r\nbusiness with thee is touching the diamonds of the Duchess of Arestino.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my business with your lordship is touching the countess herself,\"\r\nobserved Verrina, also in a cool and deliberate manner.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the marquis, with a sudden start.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord. But this is no place for explanations on that head,\"\r\nadded Stephano, glancing toward the Jew.\r\n\r\n\"I understand you, signor; we must confer alone,\" said the marquis. \"We\r\nwill go out together presently; but in the meantime, one word concerning\r\nthe diamonds which the Countess of Arestino----\"\r\n\r\n\"Employed me to procure for her,\" exclaimed Stephano, finishing the\r\nnobleman's sentence for him. \"I presume that old Isaachar here has\r\ninformed you of the particulars of my previous visit to him this\r\nnight--or rather last night, for it is now the Sabbath morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am well informed of those particulars, Sir Captain,\" returned Manuel;\r\n\"but I would fain know what has become of the jewels which you obtained\r\nfrom Isaachar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might with reason question your lordship's right to catechise me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! villain--would you dare?\" exclaimed the marquis, his countenance\r\nbecoming flushed with rage: for he imagined that the robber chief was\r\ntrifling with him. \"Far as you are beneath me--wide as is the gulf that\r\nseparates the Marquis of Orsini from the proscribed bravo--yet will I\r\ncondescend to wreak upon thee, base-born as thou art, that vengeance\r\nwhich the law has not yet been able to inflict.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Manuel unsheathed his weapon with such rapidity that the polished\r\nblade of Milan steel flashed like lightning in the glare of the lamp.\r\n\r\n\"Since this is your object, I will bear with your humor,\" muttered\r\nStephano, starting from his seat and drawing his heavy sword.\r\n\r\n\"My lord--good Signor Verrina--in mercy--not here--I implore----\"\r\nejaculated the Jew, speaking in a piteous tone, and wringing his hands\r\nin alarm at this hostile demonstration.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back!\" thundered the bandit chief; and the Jew retreated to the\r\nmost remote corner of the room, where he fell upon his knees and began\r\nto offer up prayers that no blood would be spilt--for he was a humane\r\nand kind-hearted man.\r\n\r\nThe marquis and the captain of banditti crossed their weapons; and the\r\ncombat began. The former was lighter, younger, and therefore, more\r\nactive than his opponent; but the latter was far more experienced in the\r\nuse of his sword; and, moreover, the space was too narrow to enable the\r\nmarquis to gain any advantage from his superior agility. The fight\r\nlasted about ten minutes, when the bandit parried a desperate thrust\r\nthat was made at him by his opponent, and at the next moment wounded the\r\nmarquis in the sword arm. The weapon fell from Manuel's hand, and he\r\nstood at the mercy of his conqueror.\r\n\r\n\"You are wounded, my lord--and the blood is flowing!\" cried Stephano.\r\n\"Hasten, friend Isaachar--and fetch water, bandages----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing--a mere scratch,\" exclaimed the marquis, tearing away\r\nwith his left hand the right sleeve of his doublet, and displaying a\r\ntolerably severe gash, which ran down the forearm lengthwise, and from\r\nwhich the blood trickled on the floor. \"Be kind enough to bind it with\r\nmy scarf, Signor Verrina, and let us continue in a more peaceful manner\r\nthe discourse which has been somewhat rudely interrupted.\"\r\n\r\nIsaachar, however, supplied water in an ewer, and linen bandages; and\r\nthe old man, forgetting the object of Manuel's predatory visit to his\r\nabode, hastened himself to wash and bind up the wounded arm.\r\n\r\n\"Thou art a good Jew--and hast something of the feeling of the Christian\r\nin thee,\" said the marquis, when the operation was completed.\r\n\r\n\"Didst thou ever suppose that different creeds made different hearts, my\r\nlord?\" asked the old man, in a half melancholy, half reproachful tone.\r\n\r\n\"Isaachar, I shall not forget this kindness on your part,\" said the\r\nmarquis, blushing with shame at himself, when he reflected on the\r\npurpose for which he had sought the Jew's dwelling. \"Heaven knows it is\r\nnot in my power to reward you with gold; but whenever I may henceforth\r\nhear your race traduced, reckon upon me as its champion.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man cast a look of gratitude upon the marquis; and, after some\r\nlittle hesitation, he said in a tremulous tone, \"Your lordship hinted\r\nere now--at least methought I understood as much--that you required\r\ngold. I take Father Abraham above to witness that I am not so rich as ye\r\nChristians deem me to be; but--since your lordship can say a kind word\r\nof the Jew--I--I will lend you such sum as you may need--without\r\ninterest--without bond----\"\r\n\r\nOrsini, in whose breast all generous feeling had not been entirely\r\ncrushed by the vices which had proved his ruin, extended his left\r\nhand--for his right now hung in a sling--to the kind-hearted Jew,\r\nexclaiming, \"There is the signor to whom I am indebted, worthy Isaachar;\r\nit is for him to say whether he will press me immediately for the sum\r\nthat I have fairly lost to him with the dice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I!\" ejaculated Stephano, in his blunt, coarse manner. \"And\r\ntherefore your lordship need not lay yourself under any obligation to\r\nthe Jew, who, after all, is a worthy signor in his way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed the marquis, \"I shall ever lie under an obligation to\r\nhim; nor shall I be ashamed to proclaim the fact in the presence of all\r\nFlorence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, my lord,\" resumed Stephano, \"I will give you that explanation\r\nrelative to the diamonds which you might have had without bloodshed; but\r\npatience and aristocracy are as much at variance as a thief and the\r\nheadsman. Read this paper, my lord; it is not the worst testimonial\r\nwhich I could produce in proof of good character.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he handed to the marquis the document which he had compelled the\r\nCountess of Arestino to sign.\r\n\r\nManuel read it with astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Then she _has_ the diamonds in her possession!\" he exclaimed; \"and you\r\nmust have seen her since I was there!\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" replied Stephano, as he received back the paper, \"I was at\r\nthe Arestino Palace ere now, at the same time, and in the same room, as\r\nyourself. But this is a mystery I will explain presently. As for the\r\ndiamonds--Isaachar here can tell your lordship what he has done with the\r\n_real_ stones, for those that I received from him which I handed to her\r\nladyship were _false_.\"\r\n\r\nOrsini glanced toward the Jew, who was now pale and trembling.\r\n\r\n\"It was to make inquiries on this point,\" continued Stephano, \"that I\r\ncame here on the present occasion. And to speak truly, it was also with\r\nthe intention of making the old Israelite disgorge his plunder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plunder!\" repeated the Jew, in a tone almost of indignation, in spite\r\nof the terror with which the bandit-captain inspired him. \"Did I not\r\nlend my good golden ducats upon those diamonds? and must I be blamed, if\r\nknowing--ah! knowing too well, the base artifices of which many of even\r\nthe best-born Florentine nobles and great ladies are capable, must I be\r\nblamed, I say, if aware of all this, I adopted a device which the\r\nwickedness of others, and not our own, has rendered common amongst those\r\nof our race who traffic in loans upon jewels and precious stones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isaachar speaks naught save the pure truth,\" remarked Orsini, blushing\r\nat the justice which dictated these reproaches against the aristocracy\r\nwhereof he was a member. \"Signor Verrina,\" he continued, \"you are a\r\nbrave man--and I believe you to be a generous one. Confirm this opinion\r\non my part, by refraining from further molestation toward the Jew, and\r\nthou wilt doubly render me thy debtor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be that as you will, my lord,\" grumbled the bandit-chief. \"And now let\r\nus depart--for I have much to communicate to your lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ready to accompany you,\" returned the marquis, putting on his\r\nplumed hat, and settling his cloak with his left hand.\r\n\r\n\"One word, my lord,\" said Isaachar, in his habitual nervous and\r\ntrembling tone. \"Should the Countess of Arestino _really_ need her\r\ndiamonds--_really_ need them, my lord--I--should not--object--that is,\r\nmy lord,\" he added in a firmer voice, as if ashamed at the hesitation\r\nwith which he was expressing his readiness to do a good action, \"I will\r\nat once give them up to her, trusting to her ladyship's honor to pay me\r\nmy moneys at her most befitting convenience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her ladyship does not require them now!\" exclaimed the bandit-chief,\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\nThe marquis looked at Stephano inquiringly, for there was something\r\nominously mysterious in his words; but the brigand stalked in a dogged\r\nmanner toward the door, as if anxious to hurry the departure so long\r\nprotracted, and Manuel, having renewed the expressions of his gratitude\r\ntoward Isaachar ben Solomon, hastily followed Verrina from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSTEPHANO AND THE MARQUIS--THE STRONGHOLD OF THE BANDITTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment Stephano and the marquis were alone together in the open\r\nstreet the former related all the incidents which had occurred at the\r\nArestino Palace after the departure of Manuel himself; and the young\r\nnobleman now learned, with feelings of remorse and sorrow, that the\r\nunfortunate countess had been hurried away to the convent of the\r\nCarmelites--that species of inquisition the gates of which so seldom\r\nopened more than once for each new female victim.\r\n\r\n\"But you promised to save her, signor!\" he exclaimed, with enthusiastic\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n\"I gave this pledge in the manner described to your lordship,\" returned\r\nVerrina, \"and I shall not swerve from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think you that her liberation can be effected?\" demanded Manuel.\r\n\"Remember that the convent is protected by the highest personages in the\r\nstate--that violence never will succeed in accomplishing the object--for\r\nshould an armed man dare to pass that sacred threshold, every sbirro in\r\nFlorence would fly to the spot----\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, then, your lordship who is afraid of attempting the rescue of\r\nthe countess!\" interrupted Stephano, in a contemptuous tone.\r\n\r\n\"That observation is hardly fair, Signor Verrina,\" said the young\r\nnobleman; \"considering that my right arm is disabled, and that the wound\r\nwas received in combat with yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I crave your lordship's pardon,\" exclaimed the bandit-captain. \"My\r\nremark was most uncourteous--particularly to one who has ere now given\r\nno equivocal proof of his valor. But I pretend not to courtly manners;\r\nand such as I am you will find me faithfully devoted to your service and\r\nthat of the Lady Giulia. The attempt to rescue her will be somewhat\r\nhazardous; it is, however, tolerably sure of success. But it can only be\r\nundertaken on certain conditions; and these regard your lordship's self.\r\nIndeed, had I not so opportunely met you at the Jew's house, I should\r\nhave sent one of my fellows to you to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way do the conditions that you speak of, regard myself?\"\r\ninquired the marquis.\r\n\r\n\"To this extent,\" returned the robber-chief; \"that you accompany me to\r\nmy stronghold, wherever it may be; that you join us in any project or\r\nplan that may be undertaken with a view to liberate the Countess of\r\nArestino; and that you remain with us until such project or plan be\r\nattempted; then, whether it succeed or fail, you shall be at liberty to\r\ntake your departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed!\" exclaimed Manuel; \"and now permit me to ask you one\r\nquestion:--On what ground do you manifest this interest in behalf of the\r\ncountess and myself? You are well aware that from me you have little to\r\nhope in the shape of reward; and that the countess will be in no better\r\ncondition than myself to recompense you, even if you succeed in\r\neffecting her rescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am well aware of this, my lord,\" answered Stephano; \"and I will give\r\nyou an explanation of my motives as frankly as you solicit it. In the\r\nfirst place it suits my projects to make friends as much as possible\r\nwith nobles and great ladies; as no one can say how or when such\r\ninterest may be available to me or to those connected with me. Secondly,\r\nI am not sorry to have an excuse for paying a visit to the Carmelite\r\nConvent; and in case of failure, it will be as well to have a Florentine\r\nnoble amongst us. Because the statutes of our glorious Republic are\r\nsomewhat unequal in their application; thus, for instance, if a plebeian\r\ncommit sacrilege, he is punished with death; but a patrician is merely\r\nreprimanded by the judge and mulcted in a sum which is devoted to\r\nreligious purposes. In this latter case, too, the companions of the\r\npatrician are punished only as he himself is. Now, therefore, your\r\nlordship's presence amongst us will be a guarantee for our safety.\r\nLastly, for I have another and less selfish motive, I admire the spirit\r\nwith which your lordship spends money, drinks a flagon of good wine, and\r\nloses your thousands at dice; for saving your lordship's presence, there\r\nis much in all those facts which finds sympathy with my own\r\ninclinations. Thus, everything considered, Stephano Verrina and fifty as\r\ngallant fellows as ever bore the name of banditti, are completely at\r\nyour lordship's service, and that of the dear lady who has the good\r\ntaste to prefer a dashing roistering blade like yourself, to a gentleman\r\nno doubt very worthy of esteem, but certainly old enough to be her\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis made no reply to this tirade; but he reflected profoundly\r\nupon all that the robber-chieftain said as they walked leisurely along\r\nthrough the suburb of Alla Croce, and toward the city.\r\n\r\nHe reflected because he now saw all the dangers that were associated\r\nwith the step he was taking, the chance of being arrested with the whole\r\nband of lawless freebooters, and the dishonor that would attach itself\r\nto his name, were such an event to occur. But on the other hand, Giulia\r\nwas immured in consequence of her love for him; and his naturally\r\nchivalrous disposition triumphed over selfish considerations. Could her\r\nliberation be effected, he would fly with her into another state; and\r\nthe revenues arising from her own little patrimony which had been\r\nsettled on herself at her marriage would enable them to live\r\ncomfortably, if not affluently. And who could tell but that her husband\r\nmight die intestate? and then all his wealth would become hers by law.\r\n\r\nThus did he reason with himself.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lord--you do not reply?\" exclaimed the robber-captain,\r\nimpatient of the long silence which had followed his explanations. \"Are\r\nyou content to abide by the conditions I ere now proposed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly content,\" answered the marquis.\r\n\r\nHe knew that it was useless to reason with the brigand against the\r\nspoliation of the convent, which he had more than hinted at; for it was\r\nnot likely that the robbers would incur so great a risk as that involved\r\nin the sacrilegious invasion of the sacred establishment, unless it were\r\nwith the hope of reaping an adequate reward.\r\n\r\nThe bandit-chief and the young nobleman had now reached the boundary of\r\nthe city; but instead of entering the streets, they turned abruptly to\r\nthe right, Stephano acting as guide, and plunged into a thick grove of\r\nevergreens.\r\n\r\n\"Here, my lord,\" said Stephano, stopping short, \"you must consent to be\r\nblindfolded.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore?\" demanded Manuel, indignantly. \"Think you that I shall\r\nbetray the secrets of your dwelling, wherever and whatever it may be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I entertain no such base suspicion,\" returned Verrina. \"But we banditti\r\nare governed by a code of laws which none of us--not even I, the\r\nchief--dare violate. To the observance of this code we are bound by an\r\noath of so deadly--so dreadful a nature, that bold and reckless as we\r\nare, we could not forget _that_. And I should alike break our laws and\r\ndepart from my oath, were I to conduct an uninitiated stranger to our\r\nstronghold otherwise than blindfolded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I offer no further opposition, Signor Verrina,\" said the marquis. \"Fix\r\non the bandage.\"\r\n\r\nStephano tied his scarf over the nobleman's eyes, and then conducted him\r\nslowly through the mazes of the grove.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they proceeded for nearly a quarter of an hour, when they\r\nstopped, and Stephano, quitting Manuel's hand, said in a low tone,\r\n\"Stand still just where you are for a moment, while I give the signal,\r\nand do not move a single step--for it is a dangerous neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nAbout half a minute elapsed, during which it struck Manuel that he heard\r\na bell ring far--far under ground. The sound was very faint: but still\r\nhe felt convinced that he did hear it, and that it appeared to come from\r\nthe bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut he had not much time for reflection; for Stephano once more took his\r\nhand, saying, \"You are now about to descend a flight of steps.\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded downward together for some distance, when the steps\r\nceased, and they pursued their way on a flat surface of pavement; but\r\nthe echoes of their footsteps convinced the marquis that he was treading\r\na subterranean cavern or passage.\r\n\r\nPresently a huge door, sounding as if it were made of iron, was closed\r\nbehind them, and Stephano exchanged a few words in a whisper with some\r\none who spoke to him at that point. Then they descended a few more\r\nsteps, and at the bottom another door was banged heavily, when they had\r\npassed its threshold,--the echoes resounding like pistol-shots\r\nthroughout the place.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes more did they proceed on another level-paved floor:\r\nand then the gurgling rush of a rapid stream met the ears of the\r\nmarquis.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful in following me,\" said Stephano; \"for you are about to cross\r\na narrow bridge, my lord--and one false step is destruction.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly they passed over the bridge, which seemed to be a single plank of\r\nabout thirty feet in length and excessively narrow, he had no doubt,\r\nboth from the caution which he had received and the elasticity of that\r\ndangerous pathway.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side, the level-paved surface was continued; and at the\r\nexpiration of another minute, heavy folding-doors closed behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Take off the bandage, my lord,\" said Stephano, as he untied the knot\r\nwhich fastened the scarf at the back of the young nobleman's head.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Orsini gladly availed himself of this permission; and\r\nwhen the bandage fell from his eyes, he found himself in a spacious\r\ncavern, paved with marble, hung with rich tapestry, and lighted by four\r\nchandeliers of massive silver.\r\n\r\nSix pillars of crystal supported the roof, and rendered the luster of\r\nthe chandeliers almost insupportably brilliant by means of reflection.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this subterranean apartment stood a large table, covered\r\nwith flagons, empty wine flasks, and drinking-cups; but the revelers had\r\nretired to rest--and the marquis and Stephano were alone in that\r\nbanqueting-hall.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, my lord,\" said the bandit-captain; \"and I will conduct you\r\nto a place where you will find as dainty a couch as even a nobleman so\r\naccustomed to luxury as your lordship need not despise.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking Stephano opened an iron door at the end of the hall, and\r\nled the way along a narrow and low corridor, lighted by lamps placed in\r\nniches at short intervals. At the end of this corridor he knocked at\r\nanother door, which was opened in a few moments by a man who had\r\nevidently been aroused from his slumber.\r\n\r\n\"I bring a guest, Lomellino,\" said Verrina. \"See that his lordship be\r\nwell cared for.\"\r\n\r\nStephano then retraced his way along the corridor, and Lomellino closed\r\nand bolted the iron door.\r\n\r\nBut no pen can describe the astonishment of the marquis when he found\r\nhimself in a spacious room, heaped all around with immense riches.\r\nMassive plate, splendid chandeliers, gorgeous suits of armor and martial\r\nweapons incrusted with gold or set with precious stones, chalices and\r\ndishes of silver, bags of money piled in heaps, an immense quantity of\r\njewelry spread upon shelves, and an infinite assortment of the richest\r\nwearing apparel--all these, suddenly bursting upon the young nobleman's\r\nview by the light of a lamp suspended to the roof, produced an effect at\r\nonce brilliant and astounding.\r\n\r\nWhen Lomellino addressed him with a request to follow whither he should\r\nlead, it seemed as if some rude voice were suddenly awaking him from a\r\ndelicious dream--save that the cause of his pleasure and wonder was\r\nstill present. Then, ashamed at having allowed himself to be so\r\nattracted by the spectacle of boundless wealth around him, he followed\r\nLomellino to an alcove at the further end of the caverned room, and the\r\nentrance of which was covered by a purple velvet curtain, richly fringed\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\nWithin were two beds, having a screen between them. These couches were\r\nof the most comfortable description, and such as in those times were not\r\nusually seen elsewhere than in the dwellings of the wealthy. Near each\r\nbed stood a toilet-table and wash-stand, with ewers of massive silver\r\nand towels of fine linen; and to the walls hung two large\r\nmirrors--articles of exclusive luxury at that period. The floor was\r\nrichly carpeted, and a perfumed lamp burned in front of the dial of a\r\nwater-clock.\r\n\r\nLomellino respectfully informed the marquis that one division of the\r\nalcove was at his service; and Manuel was too much wearied by the\r\nadventures of the evening not to avail himself of the information.\r\n\r\nThe brigand seeing that he was wounded, but without asking any questions\r\nas to the cause, proffered his aid to divest the marquis of his upper\r\nclothing; and at length the young nobleman was comfortably stretched in\r\none of the voluptuous beds.\r\n\r\nSleep had just closed his eyelids, and he had even already entered upon\r\na vision of fairy enchantment,--doubtless conjured up to his imagination\r\nby the gorgeous spectacle of the treasure-room,--when he was startled by\r\nscreams which appeared to issue from the very wall of the alcove, at the\r\nhead of his bed.\r\n\r\nHe listened--and those screams became more and more piercing in their\r\nnature, although their tone was subdued, as if by the existence of a\r\nthick intervening partition.\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin! what sounds are those?\" he exclaimed, more in pity than in\r\nfear--for they were unmistakably female shrieks which he heard.\r\n\r\n\"Perdition seize on those Carmelite nuns!\" cried Lomellino; \"they seem\r\nto have got another victim!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Another victim!_\" murmured the marquis falling back in his bed, a prey\r\nto the most torturing feelings; and then his lips framed the sweet and\r\ntender name of \"GIULIA!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA FEARFUL ACCUSATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFair and beauteous art thou, O City of Flowers! with thy domes and\r\nspires, and turrets overlooking the Arno's silver stream, and crowding\r\ntogether in that river's classic pale; surrounded, too, by oak-covered\r\nhills, and cypress groves, and gardens of olives and evergreens, and\r\npresenting to the view of the spectator who stands on the lofty summit\r\nof Monte Senario, so vast an assemblage of palaces as to justify the\r\nsaying of Ariosto, that it seemed as if the very soil produced them!\r\n\r\nOr seen from the olive-crowned hill of Fesole, consecrated by the genius\r\nof Milton, how glorious is thy rich combination of beauty, thou Athens\r\nof Etruria!\r\n\r\nThe sun dawned upon the eventful night, the incidents of which have\r\noccupied so many chapters. The golden flood poured upon the Florentine\r\nscene, so fair even in winter, bathing in yellow luster the mighty dome\r\nof the cathedral of St. Mary, the ducal palace on its left, and the\r\ncupola of the Medicean chapel on its right, and bringing out into strong\r\nrelief against the deep foliage of the evergreens the marble fronts of\r\npalaces, villas, and convents, seated amidst the hills, or scattered\r\nthrough the vale--the whole affording a rich and varied view, as if\r\neternal summer reigned in that delightful region and beneath the purple\r\ncanopy of that warm Italian sky!\r\n\r\nAlas! that the selfish interests, dark passions, conflicting feeling,\r\nclashing aims, and black, black crimes of men should mar the serenity\r\nand peace which ought to maintain an existence congenial to this scene!\r\n\r\nScarcely had the orient beams penetrated through the barred casements of\r\nthe Jew Isaachar's house in the suburb of Alla Croce, when the old man\r\nwas awakened from a repose to which he had only been able to withdraw a\r\ncouple of hours previously, by a loud and impatient knocking at his\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nStarting from his couch, he glanced from the window, and, to his dismay,\r\nbeheld the lieutenant of police, accompanied by half a dozen of his\r\nterrible sbirri, and by an individual in the plain, sober garb of a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nA cold tremor came over the unhappy Israelite, for he knew that this\r\nofficial visit could bode him no good: and the dread of having\r\nencountered the resentment of the Count of Arestino, immediately\r\nconjured up appalling scenes of dungeons, chains, judgment-halls and\r\ntortures, to his affrighted imagination.\r\n\r\nThe dark hints which Manuel d'Orsini had dropped relative to the\r\npossibility of the count's discovering the affair of the diamonds, and\r\nthe certain vengeance that would ensue, flashed to the mind of Isaachar\r\nben Solomon; and he stood, as it were, paralyzed at the window, gazing\r\nwith the vacancy of despair upon the armed men, on whose steel morions\r\nand pikes the morning sunbeams now fell in radiant glory.\r\n\r\nThe knocking was repeated more loudly and with greater impatience than\r\nbefore; and Isaachar, suddenly restored to himself, and remembering that\r\nit was dangerous as well as useless to delay the admittance of those who\r\nwould not hesitate to force a speedy entry, huddled on his garments, and\r\ndescended to the door.\r\n\r\nThe moment it was opened, the sbirri and the citizen entered; and the\r\nlieutenant, turning shortly round upon the Jew, said, \"His Excellency\r\nthe Count of Arestino demands, through my agency, the restoration of\r\ncertain diamonds which his lordship has good reason to believe are in\r\nyour possession. But think not that his lordship is desirous of\r\nplundering you of these jewels which you hold as security for certain\r\nmoneys advanced, for here is the gold to repay thee.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, the lieutenant produced from beneath his cloak a heavy\r\nbag of gold; and Isaachar, now considerably relieved of his\r\napprehensions, led the way into the apartment where he had received the\r\nMarquis of Orsini and Stephano de Verrina during the past night.\r\n\r\n\"Hast thou heard my message, Israelite?\" demanded the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes; and his lordship is a worthy man--an estimable man. No\r\noppressor of the poor defenseless Jew is he! Would that Florence\r\nabounded in such nobles as the Count of Arestino!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cease thy prating, Jew, and let us dispatch this business,\" cried the\r\nofficer. \"You see,\" he added, glancing toward his men, \"that with these\r\nat my disposal, the ransacking of your dwelling would be a light and\r\neasy matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not render it necessary,\" returned the Jew. \"Tarry ye here a few\r\nmoments and the diamonds shall be delivered up.\"\r\n\r\nIsaachar proceeded into another apartment, the lieutenant following him\r\nas far as the passage to see that he did not escape. When the old man\r\nreturned, he had a small rosewood case in his hand: and from this box he\r\nproduced the stones which had been extracted from the settings the very\r\nday the jewels were first mortgaged to him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, signor,\" said the lieutenant, turning to the citizen in the plain\r\nsober garb, \"as you are the diamond merchant of whom his lordship the\r\ncount originally purchased the precious stones which have been traced to\r\nthe possession of Isaachar, it is for you to declare whether those be\r\nthe true diamonds or not.\"\r\n\r\nThe citizen examined the stones, and having pronounced them to be the\r\ngenuine ones, took his departure, his services being no longer required.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant secured the rosewood case with its valuable contents\r\nabout his person, and then proceeded to settle with interest the amount\r\nclaimed by the Jew, as the sum which he had advanced on the jewels.\r\n\r\nWhile this transaction was in progress, the notice of one of the sbirri\r\nwas attracted by the marks of blood which appeared on the floor, and\r\nwhich, as the reader will recollect, had been caused by the wound that\r\nthe Marquis of Orsini had received from the robber Stephano.\r\n\r\n\"It is decidedly blood,\" whispered the sbirro to one of his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it,\" observed another. \"We must mention it to the\r\nlieutenant when he has done counting out that gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I have heard about the Jews?\" asked the first speaker,\r\ndrawing his comrades still further aside.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" was the general question.\r\n\r\n\"That they kill Christian children to mix the blood in the dough with\r\nwhich they make the bread used at their religious ceremonies,\" answered\r\nthe sbirro.\r\n\r\n\"Depend upon it. Isaachar has murdered a Christian child for that\r\npurpose!\" said one of his companions.\r\n\r\nThis atrocious idea gained immediate belief among the ignorant sbirri;\r\nand as the Jew now quitted the room for a few moments to secure the gold\r\nwhich he had just received, in his coffer in the adjacent apartment, the\r\npolice officers had leisure to point out to their superior the traces of\r\nblood which they had noticed, and the suspicion which these marks had\r\nengendered.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant was not further removed beyond the influence of popular\r\nprejudice and ridiculous superstition than even his men: and though by\r\nno means of a cruel disposition, yet he thought it no sin nor injustice\r\nto persecute the Hebrew race, even when innocent and unoffending. But,\r\nnow that suspicion, or what he chose to consider suspicion, pointed at\r\nIsaachar ben Solomon as a dreadful criminal, the lieutenant did not\r\nhesitate many moments how to act.\r\n\r\nThus, when the Jew returned to the room with the fond hope of seeing his\r\nvisitors take their speedy departure, he was met by the terrible words,\r\nuttered by the officer of the sbirri. \"In the name of the most high\r\ninquisition, Isaachar, do I make you my prisoner!\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Jew fell upon his knees, stunned, terrified by the appalling\r\nannouncement; and although he assumed this attitude of supplication, he\r\nhad not the power to utter a syllable of intercession or of prayer.\r\nHorror had for the moment stricken him dumb: and a thousand images of\r\nterror, conjured up by the fearful words, \"the inquisition,\" suddenly\r\nsprung up to scare, bewilder and overwhelm him.\r\n\r\n\"Bind him, gag him!\" ejaculated the lieutenant: and this order was\r\nimmediately obeyed: for whenever a prisoner was about to be conveyed to\r\nthe dungeons of the inquisition, he was invariably gagged, in order that\r\nno questions on his part might evoke answers at all calculated to afford\r\nhim a clew to the cause of his arrest.\r\n\r\nThis precaution was originally adopted in reference to those only who\r\nwere ignorant of the charges laid against them: but it had subsequently\r\nbecome common in all cases of arrest effected in the name or on the part\r\nof the holy brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe Palazzo del Podesta, or ducal palace, was one of the most celebrated\r\nedifices in Florence. In strong contrast with the various beautiful\r\nspecimens of composite Tuscan, combined with a well-assimilated portion\r\nof the Grecian character, which abounded in Florence, the ducal palace\r\nwas remarkable for the stern and gloomy character of its architecture.\r\nIts massive and heavy tower, crowned with embattled and overhanging\r\nparapets, seemed to frown in sullen and haughty defiance at the lapse of\r\nTime. The first range of windows were twelve feet from the ground, and\r\nwere grated with enormous bars of iron, producing a somber and ominous\r\neffect. Within were the apartments of the duke's numerous dependents;\r\nand the lower portion of the palace had been rendered thus strong to\r\nenable the edifice to withstand a siege in those troublous times, when\r\nthe contentions of the Guelphs and Ghibelines desolated Florence. On the\r\nsecond floor there was in front a plain and simple architrave, and on\r\nthat story the windows were high and arched; for those casements\r\nbelonged to the ducal apartments. The upper stories were in the same\r\nstyle; but the general aspect was stern and mournful to a degree.\r\n\r\nThe palace was built, as indeed nearly all the Florentine mansions then\r\nwere, and still are, in the form of a square; and around this court,\r\nwhich was of an antique and gloomy cast, were numerous monumental\r\nstones, whereon were inscribed the names of the nobles and citizens who\r\nhad held high offices in the state previous to the establishment of the\r\nsway of the Medici.\r\n\r\nIt was beneath the Palazzo del Podesta that the dungeons of the criminal\r\nprison and also those of the inquisition were situated.\r\n\r\nIn a cell belonging to the former department, Fernand Wagner was already\r\na captive; and Isaachar ben Solomon now became the inmate of a narrow,\r\ncold, and damp stone chamber, in that division of the subterrane which\r\nwas within the jurisdiction of the holy office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE VISIT OF THE BANDITTI TO THE RIVEROLA PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Monday night, and within an hour of the time appointed by\r\nStephano for the meditated invasion of the Riverola Palace.\r\n\r\nFrancisco had already retired to rest, for he was wearied with vain and\r\nineffectual wandering about the city and its environs in search of some\r\ntrace that might lead him to discover his lost Flora.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the few days which had now elapsed since her mysterious\r\ndisappearance had been passed by the young count in making every\r\npossible inquiry and adopting every means which imagination could\r\nsuggest to obtain a clew to her fate. But all in vain. And never for a\r\nmoment did he suspect that she might be an inmate of the Carmelite\r\nConvent, for, although he was aware of the terrible power wielded by\r\nthat institution, yet feeling convinced that Flora herself was incapable\r\nof any indiscretion, it never struck him that the wicked machinations of\r\nanother might place her in the custody of the dreaded Carmelite abbess.\r\n\r\nWe said that Francisco had retired to rest somewhat early on the\r\nabove-mentioned night, and the domestics, yielding to the influence of a\r\nsoporific which Antonio, the faithless valet, had infused into the wine\r\nwhich it was his province to deal out to them under the superintendence\r\nof the head butler, had also withdrawn to their respective chambers.\r\n\r\nNisida had dismissed her maids shortly before eleven, but she did not\r\nseek her couch. There was an expression of wild determination, of firm\r\nresolve, in her dark black eyes and her compressed lips which denoted\r\nthe courage of her dauntless but impetuous mind. For of that mind the\r\nlarge piercing eyes seemed an exact transcript.\r\n\r\nTerrible was she in the decision of her masculine--oh! even more than\r\nmasculine--character, for beneath that glorious beauty with which she\r\nwas arrayed beat a heart that scarcely knew compunction, or that, at all\r\nevents, would hesitate at nothing calculated to advance her interests or\r\nher projects.\r\n\r\nThough devoured with ardent passions, and of a temperament naturally\r\nvoluptuous and sensual even to an extreme, she had hitherto remained\r\nchaste, as much for want of opportunity to assuage the cravings of her\r\nmad desires, as through a sentiment of pride--but since she had loved\r\nWagner--the first and only man whom she had ever loved--her warm\r\nimagination had excited those desires to such a degree, that she felt\r\ncapable of making any sacrifice, save one--to secure him to herself.\r\n\r\nAnd that one sacrifice which she could not make was not her honor: no,\r\nof that she now thought but little in the whirlwind of her impetuous,\r\nardent, heated imagination. But, madly as she loved Fernand Wagner--that\r\nis, loved him after the fashion of her own strange and sensual\r\nheart--she loved her brother still more; and this attachment was at\r\nleast a pure, a holy sentiment, and a gloriously redeeming trait in the\r\ncharacter of this wondrous woman, of a mind so darkly terrible.\r\n\r\nAnd for her brother's sake it was that there was one sacrifice--a\r\nsacrifice of a tremendous, but painfully persevered-in project--which\r\nshe would not make even to her love for Fernand Wagner! No, rather would\r\nshe renounce him forever--rather would she perish, consumed by the\r\nraging fires of her own ungratified passions, than sacrifice one tittle\r\nof what she deemed to be her brother's welfare to any selfish feeling of\r\nher own!\r\n\r\nWherefore do we dwell on this subject now?\r\n\r\nBecause such was the resolution which Nisida vowed within her own heart,\r\nas she stood alone in her chamber, and fixed her eyes upon a document,\r\nbearing the ducal seal that lay upon the table.\r\n\r\nThat document contained the decision of his highness in respect to the\r\nmemorial which she had privately forwarded to him in accordance with the\r\nadvice given her a few days previously by Dr. Duras. The duke lost no\r\ntime in vouchsafing a reply; and this reply was unfavorable to the hopes\r\nof Nisida. His highness refused to interfere with the provisions of the\r\nlate count's will; and this decision was represented to be final.\r\n\r\nTherefore it was that Nisida solemnly vowed within herself to persevere\r\nin a course so long ago adopted, and ever faithfully, steadily, sternly\r\nadhered to since the day of its commencement; and, as if to confirm\r\nherself in the strength of this resolution, she turned her eyes with\r\nadoring, worshiping look toward the portrait of her maternal parent,\r\nthose eloquent, speaking orbs seeming almost to proclaim the words which\r\nher lips could not utter, \"Yes, mother--sainted mother! thou shalt be\r\nobeyed!\"\r\n\r\nThen she hastily secured the ducal missive in an iron box where she was\r\nin the habit of keeping her own private papers, and which opened with a\r\nsecret spring.\r\n\r\nBut did she, then, mean to renounce her love for Wagner? Did she\r\ncontemplate the terrible alternative of abandoning him in his\r\nmisfortune, in his dungeon?\r\n\r\nNo--far from that! She would save him if she could; she would secure him\r\nto herself, if such were possible; but she would not sacrifice to these\r\nobjects the one grand scheme of her life, that scheme which had formed\r\nher character as we now find it, and which made her stand alone, as it\r\nwere, among the millions of her own sex!\r\n\r\nAnd it was to put into execution the plan which she had devised to\r\neffect Wagner's freedom, that she was now arming herself with all the\r\nresolution, all the magnanimity, all the firmness with which her\r\nmasculine soul was capable.\r\n\r\nThe dial on the mantel in the chamber marked the hour of eleven; and\r\nNisida commenced her preparations.\r\n\r\nHaving divested herself of her upper garment, she put on a thin, but\r\nstrong, and admirably formed corselet, made so as to fit the precise\r\ncontour of her ample bust, and completely to cover her bosom. Then she\r\nassumed a black velvet robe, which reached up to her throat, and\r\nentirely concealed the armor beneath. Her long flexible dagger was next\r\nthrust carefully into a sheath formed by the wide border of her\r\nstomacher; and her preparations for defense in case of peril were\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nShe now took from a cupboard six small bags, which were nevertheless\r\nheavy, for they were filled with gold; and these she placed on a table.\r\nThen seating herself at that table, she wrote a few lines on several\r\nslips of paper, and these she thrust into her bosom.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished her arrangements thus far, the Lady Nisida took a\r\nlamp in her hand, and quitted her apartments.\r\n\r\nAscending a staircase leading to the upper story, she paused at one of\r\nseveral doors in a long corridor, and slowly and noiselessly drew the\r\nbolt, by which that door might be fastened outside.\r\n\r\nThis was Antonio's room; and thus, by Nisida's precaution, was he made a\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nShe then retraced her way to the floor below, and proceeded to the\r\napartment in which her father breathed his last, and where the\r\nmysterious closet was situated.\r\n\r\nNo one until now had entered that room since the day of the late count's\r\nfuneral; and its appearance was gloomy and mournful in the extreme; not\r\nonly on account of the dark, heavy hangings of the bed, and the drawn\r\ncurtains of the windows, but also from the effect of the ideas\r\nassociated with that chamber.\r\n\r\nAnd as Nisida glanced toward the closet-door, even she trembled, and her\r\ncountenance became ashy pale; for not only did she shudder at the\r\nthought of the horrors which that closet contained, but through her\r\nbrain also flashed the dreadful history revealed to her by the\r\nmanuscript--of which, however, only a few lines have as yet been\r\ncommunicated to the reader. But she knew all--she had read the whole;\r\nand well--oh! well might she shudder and turn pale.\r\n\r\nFor terrible indeed must have been the revelations of a manuscript\r\nwhereof the few lines above alluded to gave promise of such appalling\r\ninterest,--those lines which ran thus: \"Merciless scalpel hacked and\r\nhewed away at the still almost palpitating flesh of the murdered man, in\r\nwhose breast the dagger remained deeply buried,--a ferocious joy--a\r\nsavage, hyena-like triumph now----\"\r\n\r\nBut we are to some extent digressing from the thread of our narrative.\r\n\r\nNisida placed the lamp in the chimney, in such a way that its light was\r\nconcealed so as to leave all the immediate vicinity of the door in a\r\nstate of complete darkness; and she seated herself in a chair close by,\r\nto await the expected events of midnight.\r\n\r\nSlowly, slowly passed the intervening twenty minutes; and the lady had\r\nample leisure to reflect upon all the incidents of her life--ay, and to\r\nshudder too at one which had dyed her hand with blood--the blood of\r\nAgnes!\r\n\r\nYet, though she shuddered thus, she did not look upon it with that\r\nunbounded, tremendous horror that would be experienced by a lady\r\nsimilarly placed in these times; for jealousy was a feeling that, by the\r\ntacit convention of a vitiated society, was an excuse for even murder;\r\nand, moreover, she possessed the true Italian heart, which deemed the\r\ndeath of a rival in love a justifiable act of vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut she felt some compunction, because she had learnt, when it was too\r\nlate, that Agnes was not the mistress of Fernand Wagner; and she was\r\nconvinced that in affirming this much he had uttered the strictest\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThus was she rather grieved at the fatal mistake than appalled by the\r\ndeed itself; and she shuddered because she knew that her fearful\r\nimpetuosity of disposition had led to the unnecessary deed which had\r\nentailed so dark a suspicion and so much peril upon her lover.\r\n\r\nShe was in the midst of these and other reflections connected with the\r\nvarious salient features of her life, when the door of the room was\r\nslowly and cautiously opened, and a man entered, bearing a lantern in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nTwo others followed close behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Shut the door, Lomellino,\" said the foremost.\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure that this is the room?\" asked the man thus addressed.\r\n\r\n\"Certain,\" was the reply. \"Antonio described its situation so\r\nclearly----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did he not join us?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know? But that need not prevent us----\"\r\n\r\nNisida at this moment raised the lamp from the fire-place, and the light\r\nflashing at that end of the room, produced a sudden start and\r\nejaculation on the part of the banditti.\r\n\r\n\"Perdition!\" cried Stephano, \"what can this mean?\"\r\n\r\nNisida advanced toward the robbers in a manner so calm, so dignified, so\r\nimperious, and so totally undaunted by their presence, that they were\r\nfor a moment paralyzed and rooted to the spot as if they were confronted\r\nby a specter.\r\n\r\nBut at the next instant Stephano uttered an exclamation of mingled\r\nsurprise and joy, adding, \"By my patron saint! Lomellino, this is the\r\nvery lady of whom I spoke to you the other evening!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the one who did the business so well in----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried Stephano hastily; \"you know what I mean--in Wagner's\r\ngarden! But----\"\r\n\r\nNisida had in the meantime drawn from her bosom one of the slips of\r\npaper before alluded to; and, handing it to the bandit-chief, she made a\r\nhasty and imperious motion for him to read it.\r\n\r\nHe obeyed her with the mechanical submission produced by astonishment\r\nand curiosity, mingled with admiration for that bold and daring woman,\r\nwhom he already loved and resolved to win: but his surprise was\r\nincreased a hundred-fold, when he perused these lines:--\"I am the Lady\r\nNisida of Riverola. Your design is known to me; it matters not how.\r\nRumor has doubtless told you that I am deaf and dumb; hence this mode of\r\ncommunicating with you. You have been deluded by an idle knave--for\r\nthere is no treasure in the closet yonder. Even if there had been, I\r\nshould have removed it the moment your intended predatory visit was made\r\nknown to me. But you can serve me; and I will reward you well for your\r\npresent disappointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does the paper say?\" demanded Lomellino and Piero, the captain's\r\ntwo companions, almost in the same breath.\r\n\r\n\"It says just this much,\" returned Stephano--and he read the writing\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n\"The Lady Nisida!\" ejaculated Lomellino. \"Then it is she who used her\r\ndagger so well in Wagner's garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, silly fool!\" cried Stephano. \"You have now let out the secret to\r\nPiero. True, 'tis no matter, as he is as stanch to me as you are; and\r\ntherefore he may as well know that this lady here was the murderess of\r\nthe young female in Wagner's garden: for I saw her do the deed when I\r\nwas concealed among the evergreens there. She is as much in our power as\r\nwe are in hers, and we will let her know it if she means any treachery.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could she have discovered that we meant to come here to-night,\r\nand what our object was?\" asked Piero.\r\n\r\n\"Antonio must have peached, that's clear!\" returned Stephano; \"and\r\ntherefore he did not join us, as agreed, in the hall down-stairs. But no\r\nmatter. It seems there's gold to be earned in this lady's service: and\r\neven if there wasn't I have such an affection for her I would cut the\r\nthroat of the duke or the cardinal archbishop himself merely to give her\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning toward Nisida, whose courage seemed partially to have\r\nabandoned her, for her countenance was ghastly pale, and her hand\r\ntrembled so that it could scarcely hold the lamp, Stephano made a low\r\nbow, as much as to imply that he was entirely at her service.\r\n\r\nNisida made a powerful effort to subdue the emotions that were agitating\r\nher: and, advancing toward the door, she made a sign for the banditti to\r\nfollow her.\r\n\r\nShe led them to her own suit of apartments, and to the innermost\r\nroom--her own bed-chamber--having carefully secured the several doors\r\nthrough which they passed.\r\n\r\nThe banditti stood round the table, their eyes wandering from the six\r\ntempting-looking money-bags to the countenance of Nisida, and then back\r\nto the little sacks; but Stephano studied more the countenance than the\r\nother objects of attraction; for Nisida's face once more expressed firm\r\nresolution and her haughty, imperious, determined aspect, combined with\r\nher extraordinary beauty, fired the robber-chieftain's heart.\r\n\r\nTaking from her bosom another slip of paper, she passed it to Stephano,\r\nwho read its contents aloud for the benefit of his companions--\"The\r\ntrial of Fernand Wagner will take place this day week. If he be\r\nacquitted, your services will not be required. If he be condemned, are\r\nye valiant and daring enough (sufficiently numerous ye are, being upward\r\nof fifty in all) to rescue him on his way back from the judgment-hall to\r\nthe prison of the ducal palace? The six bags of gold now upon the table\r\nare yours, as an earnest of reward, if ye assent. Double that amount\r\nshall be yours if ye succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a generous proposition,\" observed Lomellino.\r\n\r\n\"But a dangerous one,\" said Piero.\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it shall be accepted, if only for her fair self's sake,\"\r\nexclaimed Stephano, completely dazzled by Nisida's surpassing majesty of\r\nloveliness; then, with a low bow, he intimated his readiness to\r\nundertake the enterprise.\r\n\r\nNisida handed him a third paper, on which the following lines were\r\nwritten:--\"Take the gold with you, as a proof of the confidence I place\r\nin you. See that you deceive me not; for I have the power to avenge as\r\nwell as to reward. On Sunday evening next let one of you meet me, at ten\r\no'clock, near the principal entrance of the Cathedral of St. Mary, and I\r\nwill deliver the written instructions of the mode of proceeding which\r\ncircumstances may render necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall keep the appointment myself,\" said Stephano to his companions;\r\nand another obsequious but somewhat coarse bow denoted full compliance\r\nwith all that Nisida had required through the medium of the slips of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nShe made a sign for the banditti to take the bags of gold from the\r\ntable, an intimation which Piero and Lomellino did not hesitate to obey.\r\n\r\nThe private staircase leading into the garden then afforded them the\r\nmeans of an unobserved departure; and Nisida felt rejoiced at the\r\nsuccess of her midnight interview with the chiefs of the Florentine\r\nbanditti.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nFLORA'S CAPTIVITY--A COMPANION--THE LIVING TOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix days had now elapsed since Flora Francatelli became an inmate of the\r\nCarmelite Convent.\r\n\r\nDuring this period she was frequently visited in her cell by Sister\r\nAlba, the nun who had received her at the bottom of the pit or well into\r\nwhich she descended by means of the chair; and that recluse gradually\r\nprepared her to fix her mind upon the necessity of embracing a\r\nconventual life.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, without feelings of the most intense--the most\r\nacute--the most bitter anguish, that the unhappy maiden received the\r\nannouncement that she was to pass the remainder of her existence in that\r\nmonastic institution.\r\n\r\nAll the eloquence--all the sophistry--all the persuasion of Sister Alba,\r\nwho presided over the department of the penitents, failed to make her\r\nbelieve that such a step was necessary for her eternal salvation.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" exclaimed Flora, \"the good God has not formed this earth so fair\r\nthat mortals should close their eyes upon its beauties. The flowers, the\r\ngreen trees, the smiling pastures, the cypress groves were not intended\r\nto be gazed upon from the barred windows of a prison-house.\"\r\n\r\nThen the nun would reason with her on the necessity of self-denial and\r\nself-mortification; and Flora would listen attentively; but if she gave\r\nno reply, it was not because she was convinced.\r\n\r\nWhen she was alone in her cell she sat upon her humble pallet, pondering\r\nupon her mournful condition, and sometimes giving way to all the anguish\r\nof her heart, or else remaining silent and still in the immovability of\r\ndumb despair.\r\n\r\nHer suspicions often fell upon the Lady Nisida as the cause of her\r\nterrible immurement in that living tomb--especially when she remembered\r\nthe coldness with which her mistress had treated her a day or two\r\nprevious to her forced abduction from the Riverola Palace. Those\r\nsuspicions seemed confirmed, too, by the nature of the discourse which\r\nSister Alba had first addressed to her, when she upbraided her with\r\nhaving given way to \"those carnal notions--those hopes--those\r\nfears--those dreams of happiness, which constitute the passion that the\r\nworld calls love.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that Flora had suspected the coolness of Nisida\r\nto have risen from a knowledge of Francisco's love for the young maiden;\r\nand every word which Sister Alba had uttered in allusion to the passion\r\nof love seemed to point to that same fact.\r\n\r\nThus was Flora convinced that it was this unfortunate attachment, in\r\nwhich for a moment she had felt herself so supremely blest, that was the\r\nsource of her misfortunes. But then, how had Nisida discovered the\r\nsecret? This was an enigma defying conjecture; for Francisco was too\r\nhonorable to reveal his love to his sister, after having so earnestly\r\nenjoined Flora herself not to betray that secret.\r\n\r\nAt times a gleam of hope would dawn in upon her soul, even through the\r\nmassive walls of that living tomb to which she appeared to have been\r\nconsigned. Would Francisco forget her? Oh! no, she felt certain that he\r\nwould leave no measure untried to discover her fate, no means unessayed\r\nto effect her deliverance.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! then would come the maddening thought that he might be\r\ndeceived with regard to her real position; that the same enemy or\r\nenemies who had persecuted her might invent some specious tale to\r\naccount for her absence, and deter him from persevering in his inquiries\r\nconcerning her.\r\n\r\nThus was the unhappy maiden a prey to a thousand conflicting sentiments;\r\nunable to settle her mind upon any conviction save the appalling one\r\nwhich made her feel the stern truth of her captivity.\r\n\r\nOh! to be condemned so young to perpetual prisonage, was indeed hard,\r\ntoo hard--enough to make reason totter on its throne and paralyze the\r\npowers of even the strongest intellect.\r\n\r\nSister Alba had sketched out to her the course of existence on which she\r\nmust prepare to enter. Ten days of prayer and sorry food in her own cell\r\nwere first enjoined as a preliminary, to be followed by admission into\r\nthe number of penitents who lacerated their naked forms with scourges at\r\nthe foot of the altar. Then the period of her penitence in this manner\r\nwould be determined by the manifestations of contrition which she might\r\nevince, and which would be proved by the frequency of her\r\nself-flagellations, the severity with which the scourge was applied, and\r\nthe anxiety which she might express to become a member of the holy\r\nsisterhood. When the term of penitence should arrive, the maiden would\r\nbe removed to the department of the convent inhabited by the professed\r\nnuns; and then her flowing hair would be cut short, and she would enter\r\non her novitiate previously to taking the veil, that last, last step in\r\nthe conventual regime, which would forever raise up an insuperable\r\nbarrier between herself and the great, the beautiful, the glorious world\r\nwithout!\r\n\r\nSuch was the picture spread for the contemplation of this charming, but\r\nhapless maiden.\r\n\r\nNeed we wonder if her glances recoiled from her prospects, as if from\r\nsome loathsome specter, or from a hideous serpent preparing to dart from\r\nits coils and twine its slimy folds around her?\r\n\r\nNor was the place in which she was a prisoner calculated to dissipate\r\nher gloomy reflections.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a vast cavern hollowed out of the bowels of the earth,\r\nrendered solid by masonry and divided into various compartments. No\r\nwindows were there to admit the pure light of day; an artificial luster,\r\nprovided by lamps and tapers, prevailed eternally in that earthly\r\npurgatory.\r\n\r\nSometimes the stillness of death, the solemn silence of the tomb reigned\r\nthroughout that place: then the awful tranquillity would be suddenly\r\nbroken by the dreadful shrieks, the prayers, the lamentations, and the\r\nscourges of the penitents.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of these unfortunate creatures, with their naked forms\r\nwrithing and bleeding beneath the self-inflicted stripes, which they\r\ndoubtless rendered as severe as possible in order to escape the sooner\r\nfrom that terrible preparation for their novitiate--this spectacle, we\r\nsay, was so appalling to the contemplation of Flora, that she seldom\r\nquitted her own cell to set foot in the chamber of penitence. But there\r\nwere times when her thoughts became so torturing, and the solitude of\r\nher stone chamber so terrible, that she was compelled to open the door\r\nand escape from those painful ideas and that hideous loneliness, even\r\nthough the scene merely shifted to a reality from which her gentle\r\nspirit recoiled in horror and dismay.\r\n\r\nBut circumstances soon gave her a companion in her cell. For, on the\r\nsecond night of her abode in that place, the noise of the well-known\r\nmachinery was heard; the revolution of wheels and the play of the\r\ndreadful mechanism raised ominous echoes throughout the subterrane.\r\nAnother victim came: all the cells were tenanted: and the new-comer was\r\ntherefore lodged with Flora, whose own grief was partially forgotten, or\r\nat all events mitigated, in the truly Christian task of consoling a\r\nfellow-sufferer.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the Countess of Arestino and Flora Francatelli became\r\ncompanions in the Carmelite convent.\r\n\r\nAt first the wretched Giulia gave way to her despair, and refused all\r\ncomfort. But so gentle, so willing, so softly fascinating were the ways\r\nof the beautiful Flora, and so much sincerity did the charming girl\r\nmanifest in her attempts to revive that frail but drooping flower which\r\nhad been thrown as it were at her feet; at the feet of her, a pure\r\nthough also drooping rosebud of innocence and beauty: so earnest did the\r\nmaiden seem in her disinterested attentions, that Giulia yielded to the\r\nbenign influence, and became comparatively composed.\r\n\r\nBut mutual confidence, that outpouring of the soul's heavy secrets,\r\nwhich so much alleviates the distress of the female mind, did not spring\r\nup between the countess and Flora; because the former shrank from\r\nrevealing the narrative of her frailty, and the latter chose not to\r\nimpart her love for the young Count of Riverola. Nevertheless, the\r\ncountess gave her companion to understand that she had friends without,\r\nwho were acquainted with the fact of her removal to the Carmelite\r\nconvent, and on whose fidelity as well as a resolute valor she could\r\nreckon; for the promise made to her by the robber-captain, and the idea\r\nthat the Marquis of Orsini would not leave her to the dreadful fate of\r\neternal seclusion in that place, flashed to her mind when the first\r\naccess of despair had passed.\r\n\r\nFlora was delighted to hear that such a hope animated the Countess of\r\nArestino: and throwing herself at her feet, she said, \"Oh! lady,\r\nshould'st thou have the power to save me----\"\r\n\r\n\"Thinkest thou that I would leave thee here, in this horrible dungeon?\"\r\ninterrupted the countess, raising Flora from her suppliant position on\r\nthe cold pavement of the cell, and embracing her. \"No, if those on whom\r\nI rely fulfill the hope that we have entertained we shall go forth\r\ntogether. And, oh!\" added the countess, \"were all Florence to rise up\r\nagainst this accursed institution, pillage it, and sack it, and raze it\r\nto the ground, so that not one stone shall remain upon another, heaven\r\ncould not frown upon the deed! For surely demons in mortal shape must\r\nhave invented that terrible engine by means of which I was consigned to\r\nthis subterrane!\"\r\n\r\nThe recollection of the anguish she had suffered during the descent, a\r\nmental agony that Flora herself could fully appreciate, she having\r\npassed through the same infernal ordeal, produced a cold shudder which\r\noscillated throughout Giulia's entire form.\r\n\r\nBut we shall not dwell upon this portion of our tale; for the reader is\r\nabout to pass to scenes of so thrilling a nature, that all he has yet\r\nread in the preceding chapters are as nothing to the events which will\r\noccupy those that are to follow.\r\n\r\nWe said then, at the opening of this chapter, that six days had elapsed\r\nsince Flora became an inmate of the convent, and four since\r\ncircumstances had given her a companion in the person of Giulia of\r\nArestino.\r\n\r\nIt was on the sixth night, and the two inmates of the gloomy cell were\r\npreparing to retire to their humble pallet, after offering their prayers\r\nto the Virgin, for adversity had already taught the countess to pray,\r\nand to pray devoutly, too, when they were startled and alarmed by the\r\nsudden clang of a large bell fixed in some part of the subterrane.\r\n\r\nThe echoes which it raised, and the monotonous vibration of the air\r\nwhich it produced, struck terror to their souls.\r\n\r\nA minute elapsed, and again the bell struck.\r\n\r\nFlora and the countess exchanged glances of terror and mysterious doubt,\r\nso ominous was that sound.\r\n\r\nAgain a minute passed, and a third time clanged that heavy iron tongue.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a funeral hymn, chanted by several female voices, and\r\nemanating as yet from a distance, sounding, too, as if the mournful\r\nmelody was made within the very bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut by degrees the strain became louder, as those who sang approached\r\nnearer; and in a short time the sound of many light steps on the stone\r\npavement of the chamber of penitence were heard by Giulia and her\r\ncompanion in their cell.\r\n\r\nAgain did they exchange terrified glances, as if demanding of each other\r\nwhat this strange interruption of night's silence could mean. But at\r\nthat instant the hymn ceased--and again the loud bell clanged, as if in\r\nsome far-off gallery hollowed out of the earth.\r\n\r\nOh! in that convent where all was mysterious, and where a terrific\r\ndespotism obeyed the dictates of its own wild will, such sounds as that\r\nfuneral chant, and that deafening bell, were but too fairly calculated\r\nto inspire the souls of the innocent Flora and the guilty Giulia with\r\nthe wildest apprehension!\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door opened, and Sister Alba, who presided over the chamber\r\nof penitence, appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"Come forth, daughters!\" she exclaimed; \"and behold the punishment due\r\nto female frailty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Arestino and Flora Francatelli mechanically obeyed this\r\ncommand; and a strange--a heart-rending sight met their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe chamber of penitence was filled with nuns in their convent-garbs;\r\nand the penitents in a state of semi-nudity. On one side of the\r\napartment, a huge door with massive bolts and chains stood open,\r\nallowing a glimpse, by the glare of the lamps, tapers, and torches, of\r\nthe interior of a small cell that looked like a sepulcher. Near the\r\nentrance to that tomb, for such, indeed, it was--stood the lady abbess:\r\nand on the pavement near her knelt a young and beautiful girl, with\r\nhands clasped and countenance raised in an agony of soul which no human\r\npen can describe. The garments of this hapless being had been torn away\r\nfrom her neck and shoulders, doubtless by the force used to drag her\r\nthither: and her suppliant attitude, the despair that was depicted by\r\nher appearance, her extreme loveliness, and the wild glaring of her deep\r\nblue eyes, gave her the appearance of something unearthly in the glare\r\nof that vacillating light.\r\n\r\n\"No, daughter,\" said the abbess, in a cold, stern voice; \"there is no\r\nmercy for you on earth.\"\r\n\r\nThen echoed through the chamber of penitence a scream, a shriek so wild,\r\nso long, so full of agony, that it penetrated to the hearts of Flora,\r\nthe countess, and some of the penitents, although the abbess and her\r\nnuns seemed unmoved by that appalling evidence of female anguish. At the\r\nsame instant the bell struck again; and the funeral hymn was recommenced\r\nby the junior recluses.\r\n\r\nSister Alba now approached Flora and the countess, and said in a low\r\nwhisper, \"The vengeance of the conventual discipline is terrible on\r\nthose who sin! That miserable girl completed her novitiate five months\r\nago; and the night before she was to take the veil she escaped. This\r\nawful crime she committed for the sake of some man she had known ere she\r\nfirst entered the convent, and for whom she thus endangered her immortal\r\nsoul. But her justly incensed relations yesterday discovered her\r\nretreat; and she was restored to this house of penitence and peace.\r\nAlas! the effects of her frailty were but too apparent; and that\r\nbenighted girl would become a mother--_had she long enough to live_!\"\r\n\r\nThese last words were uttered with terrible significancy; and the nun\r\nturned aside, leaving Flora and the countess each a prey to the most\r\nunspeakable horror.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the helpless victim of ecclesiastical vengeance--the\r\npoor erring creature, who had dared and sacrificed everything for the\r\nlove of her seducer--had risen from her suppliant posture, and flown\r\nwildly--madly round to the elder nuns in succession, imploring mercy,\r\nand rending the very roof of the subterrane with piercing screams. But\r\nthose to whom she appealed turned a deaf ear; for a convent is a tomb in\r\nwhich all human sympathies are immured--a vortex wherein all the best\r\nfeelings that concrete in the mortal heart are cruelly engulfed!\r\n\r\nAnd while this wretched girl--for she was scarcely yet a woman, although\r\nwere life spared her, on the way to maternity--was thus fruitlessly\r\nimploring the mercy of hearts that were stern and remorseless, the hymn\r\ncontinued, and the bell tolled at short intervals.\r\n\r\nSuddenly at a particular verse in the funeral chant, the three nuns who\r\nusually did the bidding of the lady abbess, glided noiselessly--but\r\nsurely, like black serpents--toward the victim--seized her in their\r\npowerful grasp--and bore her to the cell in which she was to be immured.\r\n\r\nThe choir of nuns raised their voices, and the bell now clanged quickly\r\nwith its almost deafening note--and those human and metallic sounds\r\ncombined to deaden the screams that burst from the miserable girl, on\r\nwhom the huge door at length closed with fearful din.\r\n\r\nThe massive bolts were drawn--the key turned harshly in the lock and\r\nstill the shrieks came from within the sepulcher where a human being was\r\n_entombed alive_!\r\n\r\nSo sickening a sensation came over Flora and the countess, when the last\r\nact of the awful tragedy was thus concluded, that they reeled back to\r\ntheir cell with brains so confused, and such horrible visions floating\r\nbefore their eyes, that their very senses appeared to be abandoning\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen they were enabled to collect their scattered ideas, and the\r\nincidents of the last half-hour assumed a definite shape in their\r\nmemories, the sound of hymn and bell had ceased--the chamber of\r\npenitence was deserted--the silence of death reigned throughout the\r\nsubterrane--nor did even the faintest shriek or scream emanate from the\r\ncell in which the victim was entombed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE BANDITTI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night of which we are speaking was destined to be one pregnant with\r\nalarms for the Countess of Arestino and Signora Francatelli.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they recovered from the effects of the appalling tragedy\r\nwhich had just been enacted, when their attention was drawn to a strange\r\nnoise on one side of the cell.\r\n\r\nThey listened, and the noise continued--resembling an attempt to remove\r\nthe massive masonry at that part of the stone chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens!\" said Flora, in a subdued whisper; \"what new terror\r\ncan now be in store for us!\"\r\n\r\nBut scarcely were these words uttered, when a considerable portion of\r\nthe masonry fell in with a loud crash; and had not the countess and\r\nFlora already withdrawn to the vicinity of the door, when the mysterious\r\nsound first began, they would either have been killed or seriously hurt\r\nby the falling of the huge stones.\r\n\r\nA faint scream burst from Flora's lips, and she would have rushed from\r\nthe cell, had not an ejaculation of joy escaped the countess.\r\n\r\nFor at the aperture formed by the falling in of the masonry, and by the\r\nglare of the light that shone on the other side, as well as by the dim\r\ntaper that burnt before the crucifix in the cell, Giulia had in an\r\ninstant recognized the countenance of the Marquis of Orsini.\r\n\r\n\"Manuel!--dearest Manuel!\" she exclaimed, rushing toward the aperture:\r\n\"art thou come to save me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Giulia,\" replied the marquis. \"But by what good fortune art thou\r\nthe very first whom it is my destiny to encounter? and who is thy\r\ncompanion?\"\r\n\r\n\"A good--a generous-hearted girl, whom you must save also from this\r\ndreadful place,\" answered the countess. \"And as for this accidental, but\r\nmost fortunate encounter, I can tell you no more than that this is our\r\ncell. It is rather for me to ask----\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no time to waste in idle talk, my lord,\" said Stephano, who now\r\nappeared at the aperture. \"Pardon my roughness, noble lady--but every\r\nmoment is precious. Is there any danger of an alarm being given?\"\r\n\r\n\"None that I am aware of,\" returned the countess. \"The place where we\r\nnow are must be a hundred yards below the surface of the earth----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my lady--that is impossible,\" interrupted Stephano; \"a hundred feet\r\nat the most--and even that is above the mark. But stand back, my lady,\r\nwhile we remove some more of this solid masonry.\"\r\n\r\nGiulia obeyed the robber-chief, and turned to embrace Flora with the\r\nliveliest manifestations of joy, which the young maiden sincerely\r\nshared--for escape now appeared to be at hand.\r\n\r\nThe aperture was rapidly enlarged by those who worked on the other side,\r\nand in a few minutes it was spacious enough to admit the passage of a\r\nhuman form. Then Giulia and Flora quitted their dismal cell, and entered\r\nthe innermost chamber of the robbers' hold, but from which the treasures\r\ndescribed in a previous chapter had all been removed away.\r\n\r\nGiulia embraced the marquis with grateful affection; but Stephano\r\nexclaimed, \"Come, my lord! Remember your oath, and join us in this\r\nexpedition to the end!\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the awful tragedy of the night flashed back to Flora's\r\nmemory, from which nothing could have dispelled it even for an instant,\r\nsave the thrilling excitement attendant on the escape from the convent;\r\nand in a few hurried words, she told the dreadful tale.\r\n\r\nBut what was the astonishment of all present, when Piero, one of the\r\nbanditti, exclaimed in a tone of mingled rage and grief, \"'Tis Carlotta!\r\nthe victim can be none other--the dates you have mentioned, signora,\r\nconvince me! Yes--five months ago she fled from that accursed\r\nconvent--and yesterday she disappeared. Ah! my poor Carlotta!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the rude but handsome brigand wept.\r\n\r\nFlora, forgetting the danger of re-entering the walls of the terrible\r\ninstitution, exclaimed, \"Follow me--it may not be too late--I will show\r\nyou the cell----\"\r\n\r\nAnd she once more passed through the aperture, closely followed by\r\nStephano, Piero, Lomellino, and a dozen other banditti. The Marquis of\r\nOrsini stayed behind a few moments, to breathe a reassuring word to\r\nGiulia, whom he left in the treasure chamber (as that apartment of the\r\nrobbers' hold was called), and then hastened after those who had\r\npenetrated into the subterrane of the convent.\r\n\r\nThe party entered the chamber of penitence, where the long wax candles\r\nwere still burning before the altar; and Flora having hastily given\r\nStephano as much information as she could relative to the geography of\r\nthe place, that chieftain placed sentinels around. Flora had already\r\npointed out the door of the dungeon to which Carlotta had been\r\nconsigned; and Piero hastened to call upon his mistress to answer him.\r\n\r\nIt was a touching spectacle to behold that lawless and bold, bad man\r\nmelting into tenderness beneath the influence of love!\r\n\r\nBut no reply came from within that dungeon; and though the bolts were\r\neasily drawn back, yet the lock was strong, and the key was not there!\r\n\r\nBy this time the penitents, who slept in the various cells adjoining the\r\nchamber, had become alarmed by the heavy tread and the voices of men,\r\nand had opened their doors. But they were desired to keep back by the\r\nsentinels, whom Stephano had posted around to maintain order and prevent\r\na premature alarm, but who, nevertheless, gave assurances of speedy\r\nescape to those who might choose to profit by the opportunity.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a door, which Flora had never noticed before in the chamber of\r\npenitence, opened, and two recluses appeared on the threshold.\r\n\r\n\"The abbess!\" ejaculated Flora, yielding to a sudden impulse of alarm.\r\n\r\nBut almost at the same instant Stephano sprung forward, caught the\r\nabbess by the arm, and dragged her into the chamber; then rushing up a\r\nflight of narrow stone steps, with which that door communicated, and\r\nwhich the other recluse had already turned to ascend, he brought her\r\nforcibly back also. This latter nun was Sister Alba, the presiding\r\nauthority of the chamber of penitence.\r\n\r\nHer astonishment, as well as that of the lady abbess, at the spectacle\r\nof a number of armed men in the most private part of the entire\r\nestablishment, may well be conceived; nor was this disagreeable surprise\r\nunmixed with intense alarm. But they had little time for reflection.\r\n\r\n\"The key of that door!\" cried Stephano in a fierce and menacing tone, as\r\nhe pointed toward Carlotta's dungeon.\r\n\r\nThe abbess mechanically drew forth the key from beneath her\r\nconvent-habit, and Piero, rushing forward, clutched it eagerly. In a few\r\nmoments it turned in the lock--the next moment the door stood open.\r\n\r\nBut what a spectacle met the view of Piero, Flora, and those who were\r\nnear enough to glance within! Stretched upon the stone floor of the\r\nnarrow cell lay the victim--motionless and still! Drops of gore hung to\r\nher lips; in the agony of her grief she had burst a blood-vessel--and\r\ndeath must have been almost instantaneous.\r\n\r\nFlora staggered back--sick at the dreadful sight; and she would have\r\nfallen to the ground had not the Marquis of Orsini suddenly sprung\r\nforward to sustain her.\r\n\r\n\"This is no place for you, young lady,\" he said. \"Permit me to conduct\r\nyou back to the companionship of the Countess of Arestino.\"\r\n\r\nFlora leant upon his arm, and he half carried, rather than led her away\r\nfrom the chamber of penitence into the robbers' hold. But as they passed\r\nthrough the aperture formed by the removal of the masonry, a terrible\r\nmenace met their ears.\r\n\r\n\"Vengeance!\" cried Piero, furiously; \"vengeance on the murderess of\r\nCarlotta!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--vengeance shalt thou have, comrade,\" returned the deep, sonorous\r\nvoice of Stephano.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely were those words uttered, when the loud clanging of the\r\nbell struck up; and the abbess exclaimed joyfully, \"We are saved! we are\r\nsaved!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF THE CHAIR--THE CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will recollect that when Flora Francatelli was released from\r\nthe chair at the bottom of the pit or well, Sister Alba had led her\r\nalong a narrow, dark passage communicating with the chamber of\r\npenitence.\r\n\r\nIn a small dome-like cavity, hollowed out of the roof of this passage,\r\nhung a large bell; and in a cell opening from the side of the passage\r\nimmediately beneath the dome, dwelt an old nun, who, for some dreadful\r\nmisdeed committed in her youth, had voluntarily consigned herself to the\r\nconvent of the Carmelites, and, having passed through the ordeal of the\r\nchamber of penitence, had accepted the office of sextoness in that\r\ndepartment of the establishment.\r\n\r\nIt was her duty to keep the chamber of penitence clean, maintain tapers\r\nconstantly burning before the altar, supply also the cells of the\r\npenitents themselves with lights, and toll the bell whenever occasion\r\nrequired. She it was who had visited Flora's cell the first night of her\r\narrival at the convent, to renew the taper that burnt before her\r\ncrucifix, and to exchange the maiden's attire for the conventual garb.\r\n\r\nThis old nun it was, then, who suddenly tolled the bell, at the moment\r\nwhen Piero and Stephano were menacing the abbess and Sister Alba with\r\ntheir vengeance, and when the Marquis of Orsini was bearing away Flora\r\nto the robbers' hold, that she might have the companionship of Giulia.\r\n\r\nThe way in which the old nun rang the bell was such that the inmates of\r\nthe convent would perceive it to be an alarm; and moreover, so sudden\r\nwas its startling clang, that Stephano and Piero abandoned their hold\r\nupon the abbess and Sister Alba, and retreated a few paces, uncertain\r\nhow to act; hence the exclamation of the superior of the convent, \"We\r\nare saved! we are saved!\"\r\n\r\nBut little did that stern, imperious woman know of the desperate\r\ncharacters of those with whom she had now to deal. Ashamed of their\r\nmomentary hesitation, Stephano and Piero rushed on the abbess and Sister\r\nAlba, and dragged them, in spite of their deafening screams, into that\r\nfatal cell, where they threw them headlong over the lifeless corpse of\r\ntheir victim.\r\n\r\nScarcely, however, had they closed the door on the wretched woman, when\r\nthe Marquis of Orsini returned; and, too well divining what had passed,\r\nhe exclaimed, \"In the name of Heaven, captain!--by all that is holy,\r\nPiero! I implore you not to consummate this dreadful crime!\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said Stephano, \"ere we entered on this expedition to-night,\r\nyou bound yourself by an oath to obey me as the leader. I command you\r\nthen not to interfere with our proceedings; but, on the contrary, go and\r\nascertain whence comes the clanging of that infernal bell.\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis turned aside, sick at heart at the deed of vengeance which\r\nwas in progress, but unable to remonstrate further, in consequence of\r\nthe oath which he had taken. It was, however, a relief for him to move\r\naway from the vicinity of the living tomb, whence emanated the shrieks\r\nof the abbess and the nun; and guided by the sound of the bell, he\r\nrushed, with whirling brain and desperate resolution, into the passage\r\nleading from the chamber of penitence.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the clanging of the bell ceased, for the marquis had\r\ndiscovered the old sextoness in her cell, and compelled her to desist.\r\n\r\nAll the events yet recorded in the preceding and the present chapter had\r\noccurred with a rapidity which the reader can scarcely comprehend,\r\nbecause their complicated nature and variety have forced us to enter\r\ninto minute details requiring a considerable time to peruse. Those\r\nevents which we are now about to describe also succeeded each other with\r\nmarvelous speed, and occupied an incredibly short space of time,\r\nalthough our narrative must necessarily appear prolix in comparison.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary was the excitement that now prevailed in all the\r\nsubterranean department of the convent. The victims of a stern but just\r\nvengeance were sending forth appalling screams from the fatal dungeon;\r\nand some of the penitents in their cells, which were still guarded by\r\nthe sentinels, were also giving vent to their affright by means of\r\npiercing shrieks, though others remained tranquil in hope of the\r\npromised release.\r\n\r\nStephano had entirely recovered his presence of mind, and now issued his\r\norders with wondrous rapidity.\r\n\r\nPointing to the door by which the abbess and Sister Alba had entered the\r\nchamber of penitence, he said, \"Lomellino, that is the way to the upper\r\npart of the convent--there can be no doubt of it! Take Piero and half a\r\ndozen of the men, and hasten up that staircase. Secure the front gate of\r\nthe building, and possess yourself of the plate and treasure. But no\r\nviolence, remember--no violence to the nuns.\"\r\n\r\nLomellino, Piero, and six of the banditti hastened to obey these\r\ncommands, while Stephano remained below to act as circumstances might\r\nrequire. He went the round of the five cells belonging to the penitents,\r\nand enjoined those who were yielding to their terrors to hold their\r\npeace, as they had nothing to fear, but much to gain--at least, he\r\nobserved, if they valued their freedom; and to those who were tranquil\r\nhe repeated the assurances of speedy liberation already given by his\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the old woman had not seen a being of the male sex; and\r\nshe was terrified by the appearance of an armed man in that place which\r\nshe had so long deemed sacred against the possibility of such an\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\n\"Fear nothing,\" said the marquis, \"no one will harm you. But what will\r\nbe the effect of that alarm which you have rung?\"\r\n\r\n\"Merely to warn those above that something unusual is taking place\r\nbelow,\" answered the old woman.\r\n\r\n\"And by what means can access be obtained to this subterrane?\" demanded\r\nthe marquis.\r\n\r\n\"There is a staircase leading from the chamber of penitence up into the\r\nhall of the convent----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the existence of that staircase I am aware,\" interrupted the\r\nmarquis, who had seen the abbess and Sister Alba enter the chamber of\r\npenitence a few minutes previously, as stated in the preceding chapter;\r\n\"but are there no means of ingress or egress?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; follow me,\" said the sextoness.\r\n\r\nTaking up a lamp from the table in her cell, she led the way to the\r\nfurther end of the passage, threw open a door, and thrusting forth the\r\nlight beyond the opening, exclaimed in a tone denoting a reminiscence\r\nthe bitterness of which long years had scarcely mitigated--\"That is the\r\nroad whereby I came hither; and many, many others have traveled the same\r\ndownward path!\"\r\n\r\nThe marquis seized the lamp, and beheld, a few paces from from him, a\r\nwicker chair, to which two ropes, hanging perpendicularly down, were\r\nfastened. He raised his eyes, following the direction of the ropes, but\r\nas there was now no other light in the pit than the feeble, flickering\r\none shed by the lamp which he held, his glances could not penetrate the\r\ndense obscurity that prevailed above.\r\n\r\n\"What means this chair, with its two ropes? and for what purpose is this\r\nnarrow, square compartment, the mouth of which is shrouded in darkness?\"\r\ninquired Manuel.\r\n\r\n\"This is the method of descent to this region, for all those who come to\r\nthis convent either as willing penitents, or who are sent hither against\r\ntheir inclination,\" returned the sextoness. \"And though I came a willing\r\npenitent, yet never, never while the breath shall animate this poor,\r\nweak form, and reason shall remain, can I forget the mental agony, the\r\nintense anguish, of that fearful descent. Ah! it is a cruel engine of\r\ntorture, although it tears not the flesh, nor racks the limbs, nor\r\ndislocates the joints. And even though thirty long years have passed\r\nsince I made that dread journey,\" she continued, glancing\r\nupwards--\"thirty years since I last saw the light of day--and though I\r\nhave since learned and seen how much of the horror of that descent is\r\nproduced by the delusion of mechanical ingenuity--yet still I shudder,\r\nand my blood runs cold within me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me, old woman,\" said the marquis, \"your words are an enigma. But you\r\nhave excited my curiosity: speak quickly, and explain yourself, for I\r\nmay not linger here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Behold this basket,\" returned the nun, without further preface--\"these\r\nropes connect it with complicated machinery in some chamber adjoining\r\nthe well itself. In that basket those who are doomed to pass the ordeal\r\nof penitence are lowered from an apartment above. This apartment is\r\nreally but a short distance overhead: but the art of the mechanist has\r\nso contrived the four wooden walls of the well, that when the descent of\r\nthe basket ceases, those walls rise slowly upward, and thus descent\r\nappears to be continued. Then, when the affrighted female stretches\r\nforth her hands wildly, she encounters the ascending walls, and she\r\nbelieves that she is still going down--down--down! Oh! signor, it is\r\nmost horrible, but a fitting prelude to the terrors of that place!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she pointed back toward the chamber of penitence. The marquis was\r\nabout to make some observation in reply to the strange disclosures of\r\nthe old sextoness, when suddenly the din of a tumult, occurring, as it\r\nseemed, in that department of the convent far overhead, reached his\r\nears, commencing with the rushing of many feet--the ejaculations of\r\nhostile bands--and then continuing with the clash of arms, and the\r\nshrieks of affrighted women--until, in a few moments, those ominous\r\nsounds were broken in upon and dominated by the wild, terrific cry of\r\n\"Fire! fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! wherefore have I tarried here so long?\" exclaimed the marquis; and\r\nhe was about to return to the chamber of penitence, when a sudden blaze\r\nof light appeared at the mouth of the pit, thirty yards above. Looking\r\nhastily up, he beheld the flames rolling over the entrance of that well\r\nat the bottom of which he stood; and, in another minute, the forked fire\r\nburst from the sides, forcing for itself a way through the wooden walls;\r\nand the old dry timber and planks yielded to the devouring element as if\r\nthey had been steeped in oil.\r\n\r\nBut while the marquis was still standing at the bottom looking up the\r\npit, the clash of weapons, the tread of many steps, and the\r\nvociferations of combatants appeared to grow nearer; then in another\r\nmoment he became aware that the hostile sounds came down the well, and\r\nproceeded from the room far above, where the fire as well as the war was\r\nraging.\r\n\r\nManuel had again turned around to hurry back to the chamber of\r\npenitence, when a loud cry of despair came vibrating down, and in\r\nanother instant the heavy form of a man was precipitated into the well.\r\nThe wicker chair fortunately broke his fall, and he rose with a dreadful\r\nimprecation.\r\n\r\n\"Piero!\" cried the marquis.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my lord, is it you?\" said the bandit faintly, as he staggered back\r\nand fell heavily on the floor. \"This is a bad business--the sbirri were\r\nalarmed, and broke in--Lomellino has got away, but the rest who were\r\nwith me are slain----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are wounded, Piero,\" ejaculated the marquis, rushing forward to\r\nassist the bandit, from whose breast he now perceived the blood to be\r\nflowing.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind me, my lord!\" said Piero faintly. \"Haste and tell Verrina\r\nthat--our men fought well--it was not their fault--nor mine--the nuns\r\nmust have given--the--alarm----\"\r\n\r\nHis voice had grown fainter as he spoke: and, while the marquis was\r\nendeavoring to raise him, he fell back again, and expired with the name\r\nof Carlotta upon his tongue.\r\n\r\nThe combat had ceased above, but the flames had increased in the well to\r\nsuch an extent that the marquis was compelled to beat a rapid retreat\r\ntoward the chamber of penitence, whither the old sextoness had already\r\nfled. At the entrance of that apartment he met Stephano, who, alarmed by\r\nthe clashing of arms and the cries of \"fire\" that had reached his ears,\r\nand which seemed to come from the direction of the passage, was hurrying\r\nthither to learn the cause. In a few words the marquis informed him of\r\nall that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"Back to the cavern, my friends!\" cried Stephano, in a loud tone. \"If\r\nthe sbirri discover us there, we will resist them to the death.\"\r\n\r\nAnd followed by the marquis and two or three of his men, the captain\r\npassed through the aperture made from the cell recently occupied by\r\nFlora and the countess, into the treasure-chamber.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had those few individuals effected their retreat in this\r\nmanner, when a tremendous crash was heard, cries and shrieks of horror\r\nand dismay burst from those who had not as yet passed through the\r\nopening, and then the roof of the chamber of penitence and all the\r\nadjacent cells gave way with a din as of a thousand cannon, burying\r\nbeneath their weight the sextoness, the five penitents, the inmates of\r\nCarlotta's cell, and seven of the banditti.\r\n\r\nThose who were in the treasure-chamber felt the ground shake beneath\r\ntheir feet; the sides--although hollowed from the solid rock--appeared\r\nto vibrate and groan, and the aperture leading into the subterrane of\r\nthe convent was closed up by the massive masonry that had fallen in.\r\n\r\nFlora and Giulia threw themselves into each other's arms, weeping\r\nbitterly; for they saw how dearly their freedom had been purchased, and\r\nthey trembled for the result.\r\n\r\nBut the Marquis of Orsini, although greatly shocked at the terrible\r\nsacrifice of human life which had occurred, exerted himself to console\r\nand reassure the two terrified ladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nLOMELLINO'S ESCAPE--STEPHANO'S INTENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStephano Verrina was not the man to allow his energies to be paralyzed\r\nby the reverse he had just sustained. He immediately commanded a general\r\nmuster of his men to be held in the banqueting-hall, that he might\r\naccurately ascertain the loss his corps had sustained.\r\n\r\nGiulia and Flora were left in the treasure-chamber to snatch a few\r\nhours' repose, if they could, as it was now past two o'clock in the\r\nmorning, and the marquis accompanied Stephano to the banqueting-hall.\r\nScarcely were the men mustered, when the usual signals announcing the\r\napproach of a member of the band were heard, and in a few moments\r\nLomellino appeared amongst the troop.\r\n\r\nAll crowded round him to hear the account which he had to give of his\r\nexpedition and its failure.\r\n\r\nHis tale was soon told. It seemed that on reaching what might be\r\nproperly termed the main building of the convent, he found the greatest\r\nalarm and confusion prevailing amongst the nuns, the shrieks of the\r\nabbess, Sister Alba, and the penitents, and the alarm of the bell,\r\nhaving reached the ears of the recluses. Their consternation was\r\nincreased almost to madness when they suddenly perceived several armed\r\nmen emerging from the private staircase leading to the subterranean\r\ndepartment, and Lomellino found it impossible to tranquilize them either\r\nby threats or fair speaking. A guard of sbirri must have been passing at\r\nthe time, for loud knocks resounded at the gate, which the old portress\r\nimmediately opened before Lomellino or any of his men could interfere to\r\nprevent her. A number of police officers rushed in, and then commenced a\r\nterrific combat between the banditti and the sbirri, the former of whom\r\nwere forced into an apartment, the door of which was originally locked,\r\nbut was burst open in the deadly struggle. There the strife was\r\ncontinued, when suddenly the cry of \"Fire\" arose, and the flames, which\r\nhad caught a bed in the apartment, spread rapidly to the cumbrous and\r\ntime-worn woodwork that supported the ceiling. How the fire originated,\r\nLomellino knew not, but as some of the nuns carried lamps in their\r\nhands, and rushed wildly about in all directions in their terror, it was\r\nnot very difficult to hazard a conjecture as to the cause of the\r\nconflagration. From that apartment, where the fire began, the flames\r\ndrove the combatants into an inner room, and there Lomellino saw his\r\ncomrade Piero hurled down some steep place, he himself being too sorely\r\npressed by his assailants to be able to repair to his assistance.\r\n\r\nAt length, seeing that all his companions were slain, Lomellino had\r\nfought his way desperately through the police-officers, and had\r\nsucceeded in escaping from the convent, though closely pursued by three\r\nof the sbirri. They were rapidly gaining upon him, when an awful crash\r\nsuddenly met their ears, as they were hurrying along the street leading\r\nto the wood; and, looking back, Lomellino beheld a tremendous pillar of\r\nflame shoot up from the place where the convent had stood, to the very\r\nsky, rendering for the space of a minute everything as light as day\r\naround. The building had fallen in, and Heaven only knows how many of\r\nthe nuns and sbirri had escaped, or how many had perished beneath the\r\nruins! Those officers who were in pursuit of Lomellino were so astounded\r\nby the sudden din and the column of flame, that they remained rooted to\r\nthe spot where they had turned to gaze on the evidence of the\r\ncatastrophe: and Lomellino had succeeded in effecting a safe and\r\nunobserved return to the stronghold.\r\n\r\nThis account was particularly welcome to the robbers, inasmuch as it\r\nconvinced them that the sbirri had no clew to the secret entrance of\r\ntheir stronghold, and that none of their band had been captured in the\r\nconflict: for they would rather hear of the death of their comrades than\r\nthat they had been taken prisoners; because, were the latter the case,\r\nthe tortures of the rack or the exhortations of the priest might elicit\r\nconfessions hostile to the interests of the corps.\r\n\r\nStephano Verrina now proceeded to count his men, who had mustered fifty\r\nstrong previously to the expedition of that fatal night, which, it was\r\nascertained, had reduced the number to thirty-six--seven, including\r\nPiero, having been slain by the sbirri, and as many having perished by\r\nthe falling in of the chamber of penitence.\r\n\r\nThe captain then addressed the troop in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Worthy comrades,--our number is sadly reduced; but regrets will not\r\nbring back those gallant fellows who are gone. It, therefore, behooves\r\nus to attend to our own interests; and, for that purpose, I demand your\r\nattention for a few minutes. In pursuance of the resolution to which we\r\ncame the night before last at the general council that was held, the\r\ntreasures and possessions amassed during many years of adventure and\r\nperil have been fairly divided, and each man's portion has been settled\r\nby lot. The fourteen shares that revert to us by the death of our\r\ncomrades shall be equally subdivided to-morrow; and the superintendence\r\nof that duty, my friends, will be the last act in my chieftainship. Yes,\r\nbrave comrades,--I shall then leave you, in accordance with the\r\nannouncement I made the night before last. It will grieve me to part\r\nwith you; but you will choose another captain----\"\r\n\r\n\"Lomellino! Lomellino!\" exclaimed the banditti with one accord; \"he\r\nshall succeed our gallant Verrina!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you could not make a better choice,\" continued Stephano.\r\n\"Lomellino----\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, captain,\" interrupted the individual thus alluded to: \"but\r\nis not that little expedition to take place on Monday, in case the lady\r\nrequires it? We have received her gold as an earnest----\"\r\n\r\n\"And double that amount was promised if the affair should turn out\r\nsuccessful,\" added Stephano. \"But I have reasons of my own, which you\r\nmay perhaps understand, Lomellino, for desiring that all idea of that\r\nbusiness should be abandoned. And in order that the band may not be\r\nlosers by this change of intentions, I will give you from my own share\r\nof our long accumulated treasures----\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" cried the banditti, enthusiastically; \"we will not receive our\r\ngallant Stephano's gold! Let him act according to his own wishes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, my friends, for this generosity on your part,\" said\r\nStephano.\r\n\r\nTheir meeting then broke up; and the robbers sat down to the banqueting\r\ntable, to luxuriate in the rich wines with which the stronghold was well\r\nstored.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Orsini was compelled, through fear of giving offense, to\r\nshare in the festival.\r\n\r\n\"This resolution to abandon the command of your gallant band is somewhat\r\nsudden, meseems, Signor Stephano,\" he said: for not having been present\r\nat the council held two nights previously, he was unaware of the\r\ncaptain's intention until it was alluded to in that individual's speech\r\non the present occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord,\" was the reply; \"the resolution _is_ sudden, But,\" he\r\nadded, sinking his voice to a whisper, \"a certain little blind god is at\r\nthe bottom of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! signor, you are in love!\" said the marquis, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"And therefore, I mean to turn honest man,\" observed Verrina, also\r\nlaughing. \"In truth, I am not sorry to have found a good excuse to quit\r\na mode of life which the headsman yearns to cut short. Not that I reck\r\nfor peril; but, methinks, twenty years of danger and adventure ought to\r\nbe succeeded by a season of tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love has a marvelous influence over you, Signor Verrina,\" said the\r\nmarquis; \"for love alone could have inspired such sentiments in _your_\r\nbreast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am fain to confess that your lordship is not far wrong,\" returned the\r\nbandit. \"I have discovered a woman who is worthy of me--although she may\r\nnot consider me to be altogether deserving of her. But of that no\r\nmatter; for I am not accustomed to consult the inclinations of others,\r\nwhen mine own are concerned. And now a word in respect to yourself, my\r\nlord. When do you propose to quit this place? for according to my\r\npromise, you are now the master of your own actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mysterious assault made upon the convent--the destruction of the\r\nentire establishment--and the lives that have been lost, will doubtless\r\ncreate a terrible sensation in Florence,\" replied the nobleman; \"and\r\nshould it transpire that I was in any way implicated----\"\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible, my lord,\" interrupted Stephano. \"These men whom you\r\nbehold around you could alone betray that secret; and you must have seen\r\nenough of them----\"\r\n\r\n\"To know that they are stanch and true,\" added the marquis. \"Yes, on\r\nreflection, I perceive that I have nothing to fear; and therefore, with\r\nyour leave, the countess, her young companion, and myself will take our\r\ndeparture to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the evening, when it is dusk,\" said Stephano. \"But your lordship\r\nwill not remain in Florence?\"\r\n\r\n\"The news which you brought me, a few days ago, of the arrest of that\r\npoor Israelite on a ridiculous but most monstrous charge, has affected\r\nme strangely,\" observed Manuel; \"and as it is in my power to explain\r\naway that charge, I must tarry in Florence the necessary time to\r\naccomplish this object. The Count of Arestino will imagine that his wife\r\nhas perished in the ruins of the convent; and hence her temporary\r\nconcealment in the city will be easily effected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lord,\" said Stephano, \"it is not for me to dictate nor to\r\nadvise. But as I always entertain an esteem for a man with whom I have\r\nmeasured weapons--and as I have somehow formed a liking for your\r\nlordship--pardon my boldness--I should recommend you not to remain in\r\nFlorence on account of the Jew. The Lady Giulia might be discovered by\r\nher husband, and you would lose her again. To tell your lordship the\r\ntruth,\" he added, in a low and confidential tone, \"a friend of mine, who\r\ncommands a trading vessel, sails in a few days from Leghorn for the\r\nLevant; and I intend to be a passenger on board, in company with the\r\nsweet lady whom I have honored with my affections. What says your\r\nlordship? will it suit you to embark in that vessel?\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks, Signor Verrina,\" replied the marquis; \"but I must\r\nremain at Florence to prove the innocence of that poor, persecuted Jew.\"\r\n\r\nStephano offered no further remonstrance; and the conversation which\r\nensued possessed not the least interest for our readers.\r\n\r\nOn the following evening the Marquis, Giulia, and Flora quitted the\r\nrobbers' stronghold--all three were carefully blindfolded, and safely\r\nconducted amidst the dangers of the egress by Stephano, Lomellino, and\r\nanother bandit. When in the grove with which the entrance of the\r\nstronghold communicated, the bandages were removed from their eyes, and\r\nthe two ladies, as well as the marquis, were once more enabled to\r\nrejoice in their freedom.\r\n\r\nAccording to a previous arrangement between them, and in consequence of\r\nthe intention of the marquis to remain a few days in Florence, Giulia\r\naccompanied Flora to the dwelling of the young maiden's aunt, who was\r\nrejoiced to behold the reappearance of her niece, and who willingly\r\nafforded an asylum to the countess.\r\n\r\nThe marquis, having conducted the two ladies to the hospitable cottage\r\nof this good woman, returned to his own dwelling, his protracted absence\r\nfrom which had caused serious apprehensions amongst the few domestics\r\nwhom his means permitted him to maintain. Ere we conclude this chapter,\r\nwe shall observe in a few words that the greatest excitement prevailed\r\nin Florence relative to the attack on the convent and its destruction.\r\nMany of the nuns had escaped from the building at the commencement of\r\nthe fire; and these took up their abode in another institution of the\r\nsame order. But the thrilling events which occurred in the chamber of\r\npenitence did not transpire; nor was it ascertained who were the\r\nsacrilegious invaders of the establishment, nor by what means they had\r\nobtained an entry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ABDUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was originally Stephano Verrina's intention to observe good faith\r\nwith Nisida in respect to the service on which she had intimated her\r\ndesire to employ him and his band. But so dazzled was he by her almost\r\nsupernatural majesty of beauty on that night when he and his companions\r\nencountered her in the Riverola palace, that he would have promised, or\r\nindeed undertaken, anything calculated to please or benefit her.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, he came to reflect calmly upon the service in which\r\nNisida had enlisted him, he began to suspect that some motive more\r\npowerful than the mere desire to effect the liberation of an innocent\r\nman influenced that lady. Had she not put to death a beautiful creature\r\nwho had resided in the same dwelling with Fernand Wagner? and did not\r\nthat deed bear upon its aspect the stamp of an Italian woman's\r\nvengeance? Thus thought Stephano, and he soon arrived at the very\r\nnatural conclusion that Nisida loved Fernand Wagner. Wagner was\r\ntherefore his rival; and Verrina did not consider it at all in\r\naccordance with his own particular views in respect to Nisida, to aid in\r\neffecting that rival's liberation, should he be condemned by the\r\ntribunal.\r\n\r\nAgain Stephano reflected that as Wagner's acquittal was within the range\r\nof probability, it would be expedient to possess himself of Nisida\r\n_before_ the trial took place;--and what opportunity could be more\r\nfavorable than the one which that lady herself afforded by the\r\nappointment she had given him for the Sunday evening at the gate of\r\nSaint Mary's Cathedral?\r\n\r\nAll these considerations had determined the bandit to adopt speedy and\r\nstrenuous measures to possess himself of Nisida, of whom he was so madly\r\nenamored that the hope of gratifying his passion predominated even over\r\nthe pride and delight he had hitherto experienced in commanding the\r\nFlorentine robbers.\r\n\r\nThe appointed evening came; and Stephano, disguised in his black mask,\r\nrepaired a few minutes before ten to the immediate vicinity of the old\r\ncathedral. At the corner of an adjacent street, two men, mounted on\r\npowerful horses, and holding a third steed by the bridle, were in\r\nreadiness; and, crouched in the black darkness formed by the shade of a\r\nhuge buttress of the cathedral, two members of the troop which Lomellino\r\nnow commanded lay concealed--for the new captain of banditti had lent\r\nsome of his stanchest followers to further the designs of the\r\nex-chieftain.\r\n\r\nA heavy rain had fallen in the early part of the day; but it ceased ere\r\nthe sun went down; and the stars shone forth like beauty's eyes when the\r\ntears of grief have been wiped away by the lips of the lover.\r\n\r\nStephano paced the arena in front of the sacred edifice; and at length a\r\ngentle tread and a rustling of velvet met his ears. Then, in a few\r\nmoments, as if emerging from the darkness, the majestic form of Nisida\r\nappeared; and when Stephano approached her, she drew aside her veil for\r\nan instant--only for a single instant, that he might convince himself of\r\nher identity with the lady for whom he was waiting.\r\n\r\nBut as the light of the silver stars beamed for a moment on the\r\ncountenance of Nisida, that mild and placid luster was out-vied by the\r\ndazzling brilliancy of her large black eyes: and mental excitement had\r\nimparted a rich carnation hue to her cheek, rendering her so\r\nsurpassingly beautiful that Stephano could almost have fallen on his\r\nknees to worship and adore her. But, oh! what lovely skins do some\r\nsnakes wear!--and into what charming shapes does satan often get!\r\n\r\nNisida had replaced her veil while yet Verrina's eyes were fixed on her\r\nbewitching countenance; then, placing her finger lightly upon his\r\narm--oh! how that gentle touch thrilled through him!--she made a sign\r\nfor him to follow her toward a niche in the deep gateway of the\r\ncathedral: for in that niche was an image of the Madonna, and before it\r\nburnt a lamp night and day. To gain that spot it was necessary to pass\r\nthe buttress in whose shade the two banditti lay concealed.\r\n\r\nStephano trembled as he followed that lady whom he knew to be as\r\nintrepid, bold, and desperate as she was beautiful:--he trembled,\r\nperhaps for the first time in his life, because never until now had he\r\nfelt himself overawed by the majesty of loveliness and the resolute mind\r\nof a woman. But he had gone too far to retreat--even if that temporary\r\nand almost unaccountable timidity had prompted him to abandon his\r\npresent design;--yes, he had gone too far--for at that moment when\r\nNisida was passing the huge buttress, the two brigands sprung forth: and\r\nthough her hand instantly grasped her dagger, yet so suddenly and\r\neffectually was she overpowered that she had not even time to draw it\r\nfrom its sheath.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the scheme of Stephano, the great square in front of the\r\ncathedral was at that moment completely deserted by the usual evening\r\nloungers; and thus did he and his companions experience not the\r\nslightest interruption as they bore Nisida firmly and rapidly along to\r\nthe corner of the street where the horses were in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe lady's hands were already bound, and her dagger had been taken from\r\nher; and thus the resistance she was enabled to make was very slight,\r\nwhen Stephano, having sprung upon one of the horses, received the\r\ncharming burden from the banditti, and embraced that fine voluptuous\r\nform in his powerful arms.\r\n\r\nThe two men who had waited with Stephano's horse were already mounted on\r\ntheir own, as before stated, and the little party was now in readiness\r\nto start.\r\n\r\n\"No further commands, signor?\" said one of the banditti who had first\r\nseized upon Nisida.\r\n\r\n\"None, my brave fellow. Tell Lomellino that I sent him my best wishes\r\nfor his prosperity. And now for a rapid journey to Leghorn!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, signor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night. Farewell--farewell, my friends!\" cried Verrina; and\r\nclapping spurs to his steed, he struck into a quick gallop, his two\r\nmounted companions keeping pace with him, and riding one on either side,\r\nso as to prevent any possibility of escape on the part of Donna Nisida\r\nof Riverola.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the little party gained the bank of the Arno, along\r\nwhich they pursued their rapid way, lighted by the lovely moon, which\r\nnow broke forth from the purple sky, and seemed, with its chaste beams\r\nplaying on the surface of the water, to put a soul into the very river\r\nas it ran!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nWAGNER AND THE TEMPTER--PHANTASMAGORIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Stephano was bearing away the Lady Nisida in the manner described\r\nin the preceding chapter, Fernand Wagner was pacing his solitary cell,\r\nconjecturing what would be the result of the morrow's trial.\r\n\r\nNisida had visited him a second time on the preceding\r\nevening--disguised, as on the former occasion, in male attire; and she\r\nhad implored him, in the language of the deaf and dumb, but far more\r\neloquently with her speaking eyes and the expression of her beauteous\r\ncountenance, to allow measures to be that night adopted to effect his\r\nimmediate escape. But he had resolutely persisted in his original\r\ndetermination to undergo his trial: for by pursuing this course, he\r\nstood the chance of an acquittal; and he knew on the other hand that if\r\nhe were sentenced to die, the decree of the human tribunal could not be\r\ncarried into execution. How his escape from that fate (should death be\r\nindeed ordained) was beyond his power of comprehension; but that he\r\npossessed a superhuman protector he knew full well.\r\n\r\nWithout revealing to Nisida his motives for meeting the criminal judges,\r\nhe refused to yield to her silently but eloquently pleaded prayer that\r\nhe would escape should gold induce the jailers to throw open the door of\r\nhis cell: but he conveyed to her the assurance that the deep interest\r\nshe manifested in his behalf only bound him the more sincerely and\r\ndevotedly to her.\r\n\r\nDuring eight or nine days of his imprisonment, he had reflected deeply\r\nupon the murder of Agnes. He naturally associated that black deed with\r\nthe mystery of the strange lady who had so alarmed Agnes on several\r\noccasions; and he had of course been struck by the likeness of his much\r\nloved Nisida to her whom his dead granddaughter had so minutely\r\ndescribed to him. But, if ever suspicion pointed toward Nisida as the\r\nmurderess of Agnes, he closed his eyes upon the bare idea--he hurled it\r\nfrom him; and he rather fell back upon the unsatisfactory belief that\r\nthe entire case was wrapped in a profound mystery than entertain a\r\nthought so injurious to her whom he loved so tenderly.\r\n\r\nWe said that Nisida had visited him on Saturday night. She had\r\ndetermined to essay her powers of mute persuasion once more ere she\r\nfinally arranged with the bandit for his rescue. But that arrangement\r\nwas not to take place; for on the Sabbath evening she was carried away,\r\nin the manner already described. And it was now, also, on that Sabbath\r\nevening that Wagner was pacing his dungeon--pondering on the probable\r\nresult of his trial, and yet never ceasing to think of Nisida. His\r\nmemory re-traveled all the windings, and wanderings, and ways which his\r\nfeet had trodden during a long, long life, and paused to dwell upon that\r\nfar back hour when he loved the maiden who became the wife of his first\r\nperiod of youth--for he was now in a second period of youth; and he felt\r\nthat he did not love her so devotedly--so tenderly--so passionately as\r\nhe loved Nisida now. Suddenly, as he paced his dungeon and pondered on\r\nthe past as well as on the present, the lamp flickered; and, before he\r\ncould replenish it with oil, the wick died in its socket. He had the\r\nmeans of procuring another light; but he cared not to avail himself\r\nthereof, and he was about to lay aside his vesture, preparatory to\r\nseeking his humble pallet, when he was struck by the appearance of a dim\r\nand misty luster which seemed to emanate from the wall facing the door.\r\nHe was not alarmed; he had seen and passed through too much in this\r\nworld to be readily terrified:--but he stood gazing, with intense\r\ncuriosity and profound astonishment, upon that phenomenon for which his\r\nimagination suggested no natural cause.\r\n\r\nGradually the luster became more powerful; but in the midst of it there\r\nappeared a dark cloud, which by degrees assumed the appearance of a\r\nhuman form; and in a few minutes Wagner beheld a tall, strange-looking\r\nfigure standing before him.\r\n\r\nBut assuredly that was no mortal being; for, apart from the mysterious\r\nmode in which he had introduced himself into the dungeon, there was on\r\nhis countenance so withering--bitter--scornful--sardonic a smile, that\r\nnever did human face wear so sinister an expression. And yet this being\r\nwore a human shape, and was attired in the habiliments of that age;--the\r\nlong doublet, the tight hose, the trunk breeches, the short cloak, and\r\nthe laced collar: but his slouched hat, instead of having a large and\r\ngracefully waving plume, was decorated with but a single feather.\r\n\r\nFernand stood with fascinated gaze fixed upon the being whose eyes\r\nseemed to glare with subdued lightnings, like those of the basilisk.\r\nThere was something awful in that form--something wildly and menacingly\r\nsinister in the sardonic smile that curled his lips as if with ineffable\r\ncontempt, and with the consciousness of his own power!\r\n\r\n\"Wagner!\" he said, at length breaking silence, and speaking in a deep\r\nsonorous voice, which reverberated even in that narrow dungeon like the\r\nsolemn tone of the organ echoing amidst cloistral roofs: \"Wagner,\r\nknowest thou who the being is that now addresseth thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can conjecture,\" answered Fernand, boldly. \"Thou art the Power of\r\nDarkness.\"\r\n\r\n\"So men call me,\" returned the demon, with a scornful laugh, \"Yes--I am\r\nhe whose delight it is to spread desolation over a fertile and beautiful\r\nearth--he, whose eternal enmity against man is the fruitful source of so\r\nmuch evil! But of all the disciples who have ever yet aided me in my\r\nhostile designs on the human race, none was so serviceable as\r\nFaust--that Count of Aurana, whose portrait thou hast so well\r\ndelineated, and which now graces the wall of thy late dwelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that I had never known him!\" ejaculated Wagner fervently.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" resumed the demon; \"thou should'st be thankful that\r\nin the wild wanderings of his latter years he stopped at thy humble\r\ncottage in the Black Forest of Germany. Important to thee were the\r\nresults of that visit--and still more important may they become!\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain thyself, fiend!\" said Wagner, nothing dismayed.\r\n\r\n\"Thou wast tottering with age--hovering on the brink of the\r\ntomb--suspended to a thread which the finger of a child might have\r\nsnapped,\" continued the demon; \"and in one short hour thou wast restored\r\nto youth, vigor, and beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And by how dreadful a penalty was that renovated existence purchased!\"\r\nexclaimed Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"Hast thou not been taught by experience that no human happiness can be\r\ncomplete?--that worldly felicity must ever contain within itself some\r\nelement of misery and distress?\" demanded the fiend. \"Reflect--and be\r\njust! Thou art once more young--and thy tenure of life will last until\r\nthat age at which thou would'st have perished, had no superhuman power\r\nintervened to grant thee a new lease of existence! Nor is a long life\r\nthe only boon conferred upon thee hitherto. Boundless wealth is ever at\r\nthy command; the floor of this dungeon would be strewed with gold, and\r\njewels, and precious stones, at thy bidding--as thou well knowest!\r\nMoreover, thou wast ignorant--illiterate--uninformed: now all the\r\nsources of knowledge--all the springs of learning--all the fountains of\r\nscience and art, are at thy disposal, and with whose waters thou canst\r\nslake the thirst of thine intellect. Endowed with a youthfulness and a\r\nvigor of form that will yield not to the weight of years--that will defy\r\nthe pressure of time--and that no malady can impair,--possessed of\r\nwealth having no limit,--and enriched with a mind so stored with\r\nknowledge that the greatest sage is as a child in comparison with\r\nthee,--how darest thou complain or repent of the compact which has given\r\nto thee all these, though associated with the destiny of a Wehr-Wolf?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is of this fatal--this terrible destiny that I complain and that I\r\nrepent,\" answered Wagner. \"Still do I admit that the advantages which I\r\nhave obtained by embracing that destiny are great.\"\r\n\r\n\"And may be far greater!\" added the demon, impressively. \"Handsome,\r\nintelligent, and rich--all that thou dost require is power!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" exclaimed Wagner, eagerly--and now manifesting, for the first\r\ntime since the appearance of the fiend in his cell, any particular\r\nemotion: \"I have need of _power!_--power to avert those evils into which\r\nmy sad destiny may plunge me,--power to dominate instead of being\r\nsubject to the opinions of mankind,--power to prove my complete\r\ninnocence of the dreadful crime now imputed to me,--power to maintain an\r\nuntarnished reputation, to which I cling most lovingly,--power, too,\" he\r\nadded in a slower and also a more subdued tone--\"power to restore the\r\nlost faculties of hearing and speech to her whom I love.\"\r\n\r\nStrange was the smile that curled the demon's lips as Wagner breathed\r\nthese last words.\r\n\r\n\"You require power--power almost without limit,\" said the fiend, after a\r\nfew moments' pause; \"and that aim is within thy reach. Handsome,\r\nintelligent, and rich,\" he continued, dwelling on each word with marked\r\nemphasis, \"how happy may'st thou be when possessed of the power to\r\nrender available, in all their glorious extent, the gifts--the qualities\r\nwherewith thou art already endowed! When in the service of Faust--during\r\nthose eighteen months which expired at the hour of sunset on the\r\nthirtieth of July, 1517----\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" cried Wagner, his countenance expressing emotions of\r\nindescribable horror; \"remind me not of that man's fate! Oh!\r\nnever--never can I forget the mental agony--the profound and soul-felt\r\nanguish which he experienced, and which he strove not to conceal, when\r\nat the gate of Vienna on that evening he bade me farewell--forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"But thou wast happy--supremely happy in his service,\" said the demon;\r\n\"and thou didst enjoy a fair opportunity of appreciating the value of\r\nthe power which he possessed. By his superhuman aid wast thou\r\ntransported from clime to clime--as rapidly as thought is transfused by\r\nthe interchange of lovers' glances; and in that varied, bustling, busied\r\nlife wast thou supremely happy. The people of Europe spoke of that\r\nwestern world, the discovery of which recently rewarded the daring\r\nventure of great navigators; and you were desirous to behold that new\r\ncontinent. Your master repeated the wish; and by my invisible agency, ye\r\nstood in a few moments in the presence of the red men of North America.\r\nAgain--you accompanied your master to the eternal ice of the northern\r\npole, and from the doorway of the Esquimaux hut he beheld the wondrous\r\nplay of the boreal lights. On a third occasion, and in obedience to your\r\nwish, you stood with your master in the Island of Ceylon, where the\r\nfirst scene that presented itself to your view was an occurrence which,\r\nthough terrible, is not uncommon in that reptile-infested clime.\r\nAfterward, my power--although its active agency was but partially known\r\nto you--transported you and the count your master--_now my victim_--to\r\nthe fantastic and interesting scenes of China--then to the court of the\r\nwife-slaying tyrant of England, and subsequently to the most sacred\r\nprivacy of the imperial palace at Constantinople. How varied have been\r\nthy travels!--how rapid thy movements. And that the scenes which thine\r\neyes did thus contemplate made a profound impression upon thy mind is\r\nproved by the pictures now hanging to the walls of thy late dwelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore this recapitulation of everything I know so well\r\nalready?\" asked Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"To remind thee of the advantages of that power which Faust, thy master,\r\npossessed, and which ceased to be available to thee when the term of his\r\ncompact with myself arrived. Yes,\" continued the demon emphatically,\r\n\"the powers which he possessed may be possessed by thee--and thou\r\nmay'st, with a single word, at once and forever shake off the trammels\r\nof thy present doom--the doom of a Wehr-Wolf!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! to shake off those trammels, were indeed a boon to be desired!\"\r\nexclaimed Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"And to possess the power to gratify thy slightest whim,\" resumed the\r\ndemon, \"to possess the power to transport thyself at will to any clime,\r\nhowever distant--to be able to defy the machinations of men and the\r\ncombination of adverse circumstances, such as have plunged thee into\r\nthis dungeon--to be able, likewise, to say to thy beloved Nisida,\r\n'Receive back the faculties which thou hast lost----'\"\r\n\r\nAnd again was the smile sinister and strange that played upon the lips\r\nof the demon. But Wagner noticed it not. His imagination was excited by\r\nthe subtle discourse to which he had lent so ready an ear.\r\n\r\n\"And hast _thou_ the power,\" he cried impatiently, \"to render me thus\r\npowerful?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have,\" answered the demon.\r\n\r\n\"But the terms--the conditions--the compact!\" exclaimed Wagner, in\r\nfeverish haste, though with foreboding apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"THINE IMMORTAL SOUL!\" responded the fiend, in a low but sonorous and\r\nhorrifying whisper.\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" shrieked Wagner, covering his face with his hands. \"Avaunt,\r\nSatan, I defy thee! Ten thousand, thousand times preferable is the doom\r\nof the Wehr-Wolf, appalling even though that be!\" With folded arms and\r\nscornful countenance, did the demon stand gazing upon Wagner, by the\r\nlight of the supernatural luster which filled the cell.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou doubt my power?\" he demanded, in a slow and imperious tone.\r\n\"If so, put it to the test, unbelieving mortal that thou art! But\r\nremember--should'st thou require evidence of that power which I propose\r\nto make available to thee, it must not be to give thee liberty, nor\r\naught that may enhance thy interest.\"\r\n\r\n\"And any other evidence thou wilt give me?\" asked Wagner, a sudden idea\r\nstriking him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the demon, who doubtless divined his thoughts, for again\r\ndid a scornful smile play upon his lips. \"I will convince thee, by any\r\nmanifestation thou may'st demand, subject to the condition ere now\r\nnamed, I will convince thee that I am he whose power was placed at the\r\ndisposal of thy late master, Faust, and by means of which thou wast\r\ntransported, along with him, to every climate on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will name my wish,\" said Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"Speak!\" cried the fiend.\r\n\r\n\"Show me the Lady Nisida as she now is,\" exclaimed Fernand, his heart\r\nbeating with the hope of beholding her whom he loved so devotedly; for,\r\nwith all the jealousy of a lover, was he anxious to convince himself\r\nthat she was thinking of him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! 'tis the same as with Faust and his Theresa,\" murmured the demon to\r\nhimself; then aloud he said, \"Rather ask me to show you the Lady Nisida\r\nas she will appear four days hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so!\" cried Wagner, moved by the mysterious warning those words\r\nappeared to convey.\r\n\r\nThe demon extended his arm, and chanted in deep, sonorous tones, the\r\nfollowing incantation:\r\n\r\n    \"Ye powers of darkness who obey\r\n    Eternally my potent sway,\r\n    List to thy sovereign master's call!\r\n    Transparent make this dungeon wall;\r\n    And now annihilated be\r\n    The space 'twixt Florence and the sea!\r\n    Let the bright luster of the morn\r\n    In golden glory steep Leghorn;\r\n    Show where the dancing wavelets sport\r\n    Round the gay vessels in the port,\r\n    Those ships whose gilded lanterns gleam\r\n    In the warm sun's refulgent beam;\r\n    And whose broad pennants kiss the gale,\r\n    Woo'd also by the spreading sail!--\r\n    Now let this mortal's vision mark\r\n    Amidst that scene the corsair's bark,\r\n    Clearing the port with swan-like pride;\r\n    Transparent make the black hull's side,\r\n    And show the curtain'd cabin, where\r\n    Of earth's fair daughters the most fair--\r\n    Sits like an image of despair,\r\n      Mortal, behold! thy Nisida is there!\"\r\n\r\nThe strange phantasmagorian spectacle rapidly developed itself in\r\nobedience to the commands of the demon.\r\n\r\nFirst, it appeared to Wagner that the supernatural luster which pervaded\r\nthe dungeon, gathered like a curtain on one side and occupied the place\r\nof the wall. This wondrous light became transparent, like a thin golden\r\nmist; and then the distant city of Leghorn appeared--producing an effect\r\nsimilar to that of the dissolving views now familiar to every one. The\r\nmorning sun shone brightly on the fair scene; and a forest of masts\r\nstood out in bold relief against the western sky. The gilded lanterns on\r\nthe poops of the vessels--the flags and streamers of various hues--the\r\nwhite sails of those ships that were preparing for sea--and the richly\r\npainted pinnaces that were shooting along in the channel between the\r\nlarger craft rendered the scene surpassingly gay and beautiful.\r\n\r\nBut amidst the shipping, Wagner's eyes were suddenly attracted by a\r\nlarge galley, with three masts--looking most rakish with its snow-white\r\nsail, its tapering spars, its large red streamer, and its low, long, and\r\ngracefully sweeping hull, which was painted jet black. On its deck were\r\nsix pieces of brass ordnance; and stands of fire-arms were ranged round\r\nthe lower parts of the masts.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the appearance of that vessel was as suspicious and menacing\r\nas it was gallant and graceful; and from the incantation of the demon,\r\nWagner gleaned its real nature.\r\n\r\nAnd now--as that corsair-ship moved slowly out of the port of\r\nLeghorn--its black side suddenly seemed to open, or at least to become\r\ntransparent; and the interior of a handsomely fitted up cabin was\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nFernand's heart had already sunk within him through foreboding\r\napprehension; but now an ejaculation of mingled rage and grief burst\r\nfrom his lips, when, on a sofa in that cabin, he beheld his loved--his\r\ndearly loved Nisida, seated \"like an image of despair,\" motionless and\r\nstill, as if all the energies of her haughty soul, all the powers of her\r\nstrong mind had been suddenly paralyzed by the weight of misfortune!\r\n\r\nWagner stood gazing--unable to utter another word beyond that one\r\nejaculation of mingled rage and grief--gazing--gazing, himself a kindred\r\nimage of despair, upon this mysterious and unaccountable scene.\r\n\r\nBut gradually the interior of the cabin grew more and more indistinct,\r\nuntil it was again completely shut in by the black side of the\r\nharbor--her dark hull disappearing by degrees, and melting away in the\r\ndistance. Wagner dashed his open palm against his forehead, exclaiming,\r\n\"Oh! Nisida--Nisida! who hath torn thee from me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he threw himself upon a seat, where he remained absorbed in a\r\npainful reverie, with his face buried in his hands--totally unmindful of\r\nthe presence of the demon.\r\n\r\nTwo or three minutes passed--during which Fernand was deliberating\r\nwithin himself whether he were the sport of a wild and fanciful vision,\r\nor whether he had actually received a warning of the fate which hung\r\nover Nisida.\r\n\r\n\"Art thou satisfied with the proof of my power?\" demanded a deep voice,\r\nsounding ominously upon his ear.\r\n\r\nHe raised his hand with a spasmodic start; before him stood the demon\r\nwith folded arms and scornful expression of countenance--and though the\r\nphantasmagorian scene had disappeared, the supernatural luster still\r\npervaded the dungeon.\r\n\r\n\"Fiend!\" cried Wagner, impatiently; \"thou hast mocked--thou hast\r\ndeceived me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus do mortals ever speak, even when I give them a glimpse of their\r\nown eventual fate, through the medium of painful dreams and hideous\r\nnightmares,\" said the demon, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"But who has dared--or rather, who _will_ dare--for that vision is a\r\nprospective warning of a deed to happen four days hence--who, then, I\r\nask, will dare to carry off the Lady Nisida--my own loved and loving\r\nNisida?\" demanded Wagner, with increased impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Stephano Verrina, the formidable captain of the Florentine banditti,\r\nhas this night carried away thy lady-love, Wagner,\" replied the demon.\r\n\"Thou hast yet time to save her; though the steed that bears her to\r\nLeghorn be fleet and strong, I can provide thee with a fleeter and a\r\nstronger. Nay, more--become mine, consent to serve me as Faust served\r\nme, and within an hour, within a minute if thou wilt, Nisida shall be\r\nrestored to thee, she shall be released from the hands of her captors,\r\nthou shalt be free, and thy head shall be pillowed on her bosom, in\r\nwhatever part of the earth it may suit thee thus to be united to her.\r\nReflect, Wagner--I offer thee a great boon--nay, many great boons: the\r\nannihilation of those trammels which bind thee to the destiny of a\r\nwehr-wolf, power unlimited for the rest of thy days, and the immediate\r\npossession of that Nisida whom thou lovest so fondly, and who is so\r\nbeautiful, so exceedingly beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nDesperate was the struggle that took place in the breast of Wagner. On\r\none side was all he coveted on earth; on the other was the loss of the\r\nimmortal soul. Here the possession of Nisida--there her forced abduction\r\nby a brigand; here his earthly happiness might be secured at the expense\r\nof his eternal welfare--there his eternal welfare must be renounced if\r\nhe decided in favor of his earthly happiness. What was he to do? Nisida\r\nwas weighing in the balance against his immortal soul: to have Nisida he\r\nmust renounce his God!\r\n\r\nOh! it was maddening--maddening, this bewilderment!\r\n\r\n\"An hour--an hour to reflect!\" he cried, almost frantically.\r\n\r\n\"Not a quarter of an hour,\" returned the demon, \"Nisida will be lost to\r\nyou--haste--decide!\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me--leave me for five minutes only!\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no, not for a minute. Decide--decide!\"\r\n\r\nWagner threw up his arms in the writhings of his ineffable anguish:--his\r\nright hand came in contact with a crucifix that hung against the wall;\r\nand he mechanically clutched it--not with any motive prepense--but\r\nwildly, unwittingly.\r\n\r\nTerrific was the expression of rage which suddenly distorted the\r\ncountenance of the demon: the lightnings of ineffable fury seemed to\r\nflash from his eyes and play upon his contracting brow;--and yet a\r\nstrong spasmodic shuddering at the same time convulsed his awful form;\r\nfor as Wagner clung to the crucifix to prevent himself from falling at\r\nthe feet of the malignant fiend, the symbol of Christianity was dragged\r\nby his weight from the wall--and, as Wagner reeled sideways, the cross\r\nwhich he retained with instinctive tenacity in his grasp, waved across\r\nthe demon's face.\r\n\r\nThen, with a terrific howl of mingled rage and fear, the fiend fell back\r\nand disappeared through the earth--as if a second time hurled down in\r\nheadlong flight before the thunderbolts of heaven. Wagner fell upon his\r\nknees and prayed fervently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL OF FERNAND WAGNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the ensuing morning Wagner stood before the judge of the Criminal\r\nTribunal of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe judgment hall was a large and lofty room in the Palazzo del Podesta,\r\nor ducal palace. The judges sat in antique and richly carved chairs,\r\nplaced on a platform, beneath a canopy of purple velvet fringed with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nOn the left, at a handsome desk covered with papers, was seated the\r\nprocurator fiscal or attorney-general of the republic, distinguished in\r\nattire from the judges only by the fact of the ermine upon his scarlet\r\nrobe being narrower than theirs. Opposite to this functionary was a\r\nbench whereon the witnesses were placed. The prisoner stood between two\r\nsbirri in a small pew, in the center of the court. Defendants in civil\r\ncases were alone permitted in that age and country to retain counsel in\r\ntheir behalf; persons accused of crimes were debarred this privilege.\r\nWagner was therefore undefended.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the tribunal were usually conducted privately; but\r\nabout a dozen gentlemen and twice as many ladies had obtained orders of\r\nadmission on this occasion, the case having produced considerable\r\nsensation in Florence, on account of the reputed wealth of the accused.\r\nPerhaps, also, the rumor that he was a young man endowed with\r\nextraordinary personal attractions, had exercised its influence upon the\r\nsusceptible hearts of the Florentine ladies. Certain it is, that when he\r\nwas conducted into the judgment hall, his strikingly handsome\r\nexterior--his air of modest confidence--his graceful gait, and his\r\nyouthful appearance, so far threw into the back-ground the crime imputed\r\nto him, that the ladies present felt their sympathies deeply enlisted in\r\nhis behalf.\r\n\r\nThe usher of the tribunal having commanded silence in a loud voice, the\r\nchief judge began the usual interrogatory of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nTo the questions addressed to him, the accused replied that his name was\r\nFernand Wagner; that he was a native of Germany; that he had no\r\nprofession, avocation nor calling; that he was possessed of a large\r\nfortune; and that having traveled over many parts of the world, he\r\nsettled in Florence, where he had hoped to enjoy a tranquil and peaceful\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"The murdered female was reputed to be your sister,\" said the chief\r\njudge. \"Was such the fact?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was a near relative,\" answered Wagner.\r\n\r\n\"But was she your sister?\" demanded the procurator fiscal.\r\n\r\n\"She was not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in what degree of relationship did she stand toward you?\" asked\r\nthe chief judge.\r\n\r\n\"I must decline to reply to that question.\"\r\n\r\n\"The tribunal infers, therefore, that the murdered female was not\r\nrelated to you at all,\" observed the judge. \"Was she not your mistress?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my lord!\" cried Wagner, emphatically. \"As truly as Heaven now hears\r\nmy assertion, it was not so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she your wife?\" demanded the chief judge.\r\n\r\nA negative answer was given.\r\n\r\nThe chief judge and the procurator fiscal then by turns questioned and\r\ncross-questioned the prisoner in the most subtle manner, to induce him\r\nstate the degree of relationship subsisting between himself and Agnes;\r\nbut he either refused to respond to their queries, or else answered\r\ndirect ones by means of a positive denial.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant of the sbirri was at length called upon to give an\r\naccount of the discovery of the dead body and the suspicious\r\ncircumstances which had led to the arrest of Wagner. Two of these\r\ncircumstances appeared to be very strong against him. The first was the\r\nsoiled and blood-stained appearance of the garments which were found in\r\nhis chamber; the other was the exclamation--\"But how know you that it is\r\nAgnes who is murdered?\"--uttered before any one had informed who had\r\nbeen murdered.\r\n\r\nWagner was called upon for an explanation. He stated that he had been\r\nout the whole night; that the blood upon his garments had flowed from\r\nhis own body, which had been scratched and torn in the mazes of the\r\nwoods; that on his return home he met Agnes in the garden; that he had\r\nleft her there; and that he was told a young lady had been assassinated\r\nin the vicinity of his dwelling, he immediately conceived that the\r\nvictim must be Agnes.\r\n\r\nWhen questioned concerning the motives of his absence from home during\r\nthe entire night he maintained a profound silence; but he was evidently\r\nmuch agitated and excited by the queries thus put to him. He said\r\nnothing about the stranger-lady who had so frequently terrified Agnes;\r\nbecause, in relating the proceedings of that mysterious female in\r\nrespect to his deceased grand-daughter--especially the incident of the\r\nabstraction of the antique jewels which the late Count of Riverola had\r\ngiven to her--he would have been compelled to enter into details\r\nconcerning the _amour_ between those who were no more. And this subject\r\nhe was solicitous to avoid, not only through respect for the memory of\r\nthe murdered Agnes, but also to spare the feelings of Count Francisco\r\nand Donna Nisida.\r\n\r\nThe judges and the procurator fiscal, finding that they could elicit\r\nnothing from Wagner relative to the cause of his absence from home\r\nduring the night preceding the murder, passed on to another subject.\r\n\r\n\"In an apartment belonging to your residence,\" said the chief judge,\r\n\"there are several pictures and portraits.\"\r\n\r\nWagner turned pale and trembled. The judge made a signal to an officer\r\nof the court, and that functionary quitted the judgment hall. In a few\r\nminutes he returned, followed by three subordinates bearing the two\r\nportraits mentioned in the sixth chapter of this tale, and also the\r\nframe covered over with the large piece of black cloth. On perceiving\r\nthis last object, Wagner became paler still, and trembled violently.\r\n\r\n\"There are six other pictures in the room whence these have been taken,\"\r\nsaid the judge; \"but these six are not of a character to interest the\r\ntribunal. We however require explanations concerning the two portraits\r\nand the frame with the black cloth cover now before us.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatest excitement at present prevailed amongst the audience.\r\n\r\n\"On one of the portraits,\" continued the chief judge, \"there is an\r\ninscription to this effect,--_F., Count of A., terminated his career on\r\nthe 1st. of August, 1517._--What does this inscription mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means that Faust, Count of Aurana, was a nobleman with whom I\r\ntraveled during a period of eighteen months,\" replied Wagner; \"and he\r\ndied on the day mentioned in that inscription.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world has heard strange reports relative to Faust,\" said the chief\r\njudge, in a cold voice and with unchanged manner, although the mention\r\nof that name had produced a thrill of horror on the part of his brother\r\njudges and the audience. \"Art thou aware that rumor ascribes to him a\r\ncompact with the Evil One?\"\r\n\r\nWagner gazed around him in horrified amazement, for the incident of the\r\npreceding night returned with such force to his mind that he could\r\nscarcely subdue an agonizing ebullition of emotion.\r\n\r\nThe chief judge next recited the inscription on the other\r\nportrait:--\"_F. W. January 7th, 1516. His last day thus._\" But Wagner\r\nmaintained a profound silence, and neither threats nor entreaties could\r\ninduce him to give the least explanation concerning that inscription.\r\n\r\n\"Let us then proceed to examine this frame with the black cloth cover,\"\r\nsaid the chief judge.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" whispered one of his brother judges, \"in the name of the\r\nBlessed Virgin! have naught more to do with this man. Let him go forth\r\nto execution: he is a monster of atrocity, evidently a murderer,\r\ndoubtless leagued with the Evil One, as Faust, of whose acquaintance he\r\nboasts, was before him----\"\r\n\r\n\"For my part, I credit not such idle tales,\" interrupted the chief\r\njudge, \"and it is my determination to sift this matter to the very\r\nfoundation. I am rather inclined to believe that the prisoner is allied\r\nwith the banditti who infest the republic, than with any preterhuman\r\npowers. His absence from home during the entire night, according to his\r\nown admission, his immense wealth, without any ostensible resources, all\r\njustify my suspicion. Let the case proceed,\" added the chief judge\r\naloud; for he had made the previous observations in a low tone. \"Usher,\r\nremove the black cloth from the picture!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" exclaimed Wagner, wildly: and he was about to rush from the\r\ndock, but the sbirri held him back. The usher's hand was already on the\r\nblack cloth.\r\n\r\n\"I beseech your lordship to pause!\" whispered the assistant judge who\r\nhad before spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed!\" exclaimed the presiding functionary in a loud authoritative\r\ntone; for he was a bold and fearless man.\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely were these word uttered, when the black cloth was stripped\r\nfrom the frame; and the usher who had removed the covering recoiled with\r\na cry of horror, as his eyes obtained a glimpse of the picture which was\r\nnow revealed to view.\r\n\r\n\"What means this folly?\" ejaculated the chief judge. \"Bring the picture\r\nhither.\"\r\n\r\nThe usher, awed by the manner of this great functionary, raised the\r\npicture in such a way that the judges and the procurator fiscal might\r\nobtain a full view of it.\r\n\r\n\"A Wehr-Wolf!\" ejaculated the assistant judge, who had previously\r\nremonstrated with his superior; and his countenance became pale as\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful words were echoed by other tongues in the court; and a\r\npanic fear seized on all save the chief judge and Wagner himself. The\r\nformer smiled contemptuously, the latter had summoned all his courage to\r\naid him to pass through this terrible ordeal without confirming by his\r\nconduct the dreadful suspicion which had been excited in respect to him.\r\n\r\nFor, oh! the subject of that picture was indeed awful to contemplate! It\r\nhad no inscription, but it represented, with the most painful and\r\nhorrifying fidelity, the writhings and agonizing throes of the human\r\nbeing during the progress of transformation into the lupine monster. The\r\ncountenance of the unhappy man had already elongated into one of savage\r\nand brute-like shape; and so admirably had art counterfeited nature,\r\nthat the rich garments seemed changed into a rough, shaggy, and wiry\r\nskin! The effect produced by that picture was indeed of thrilling and\r\nappalling interest!\r\n\r\n\"A Wehr-Wolf!\" had exclaimed one of the assistant judges: and while the\r\nvoices of several of the male spectators in the body of the court echoed\r\nthe words mechanically, the ladies gave vent to screams, as they rushed\r\ntoward the doors of the tribunal. In a few moments that part of the\r\ncourt was entirely cleared.\r\n\r\n\"Prisoner!\" exclaimed the chief judge, \"have you ought more to advance\r\nin your defense, relative to the charge of murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, I am innocent!\" said Wagner, firmly but respectfully.\r\n\r\n\"The tribunal pronounces you guilty!\" continued the chief judge: then,\r\nwith a scornful smile toward his assistants and the procurator\r\nfiscal--who all three, as well as the sbirri and the officers of the\r\ncourt were pale and trembling with vague fear--the presiding functionary\r\ncontinued thus:--\"The tribunal condemns you, Fernand Wagner, to death by\r\nthe hand of the common headsman; and it is now my duty to name the day\r\nand fix the hour for your execution. Therefore I do ordain that the\r\nsentence just pronounced be carried into effect precisely at the hour of\r\nsunset on the last day of the present month!\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord! my lord!\" exclaimed the procurator fiscal; \"the belief is that\r\non the last day of each month, and at the hour of sunset----\"\r\n\r\n\"I am aware of the common superstition,\" interrupted the chief judge,\r\ncoldly and sternly; \"and it is to convince the world of the folly of\r\nputting faith in such legends that I have fixed that day and that hour\r\nin the present instance. Away with the prisoner to his dungeon.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the chief judge waved his hand imperiously, to check any further\r\nattempts at remonstrance; but his assistant functionaries, the\r\nprocurator fiscal and the officers of the court, surveyed him with\r\nmingled surprise and awe, uncertain whether they ought to applaud his\r\ncourage or tremble at his rashness. Wagner had maintained a calm and\r\ndignified demeanor during the latter portion of the proceedings; and,\r\nalthough the sbirri who had charge of him ventured not to lay a finger\r\nupon him, he accompanied them back to the prison of the Palazzo del\r\nPodesta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SHIPWRECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen days had elapsed since the incidents related in the preceding\r\nchapter. The scene changes to an island in the Mediterranean Sea. There,\r\nseated on the strand, with garments dripping wet, and with all the\r\nsilken richness of her raven hair floating wildly and disheveled over\r\nher shoulders, the Lady Nisida gazed vacantly on the ocean, now tinged\r\nwith living gold by the morning sun. At a short distance, a portion of a\r\nshipwrecked vessel lay upon the shore, and seemed to tell her tale. But\r\nwhere were the desperate, daring crew who had manned the gallant bark?\r\nwhere were those fearless freebooters who six days previously had sailed\r\nfrom Leghorn on their piratical voyage? where were those who hoisted the\r\nflag of peace and assumed the demeanor of honest trader when in port,\r\nbut who on the broad bosom of the ocean carried the terrors of their\r\nblack banner far and wide? where, too, was Stephano Verrina, who had so\r\nboldly carried off the Lady Nisida?\r\n\r\nThe gallant bark had struck upon a shoal, during the tempest and the\r\nobscurity of the night, and the pilot knew not where they were. His\r\nreckoning was lost--his calculations had all been set at naught by the\r\nconfusion produced by the fearful storm which had assailed the ship and\r\ndriven her from her course. The moment the corsair galley struck, that\r\nconfusion increased to such an extent that the captain lost all control\r\nover his men; the pilot's voice was unheeded likewise.\r\n\r\nThe crew got out the long-boat and leaped into it, forcing the captain\r\nand the pilot to enter it with them. Stephano Verrina, who was on deck\r\nwhen the vessel struck, rushed down into the cabin appropriated to\r\nNisida, and by signs endeavored to convey to her a sense of the danger\r\nwhich menaced them. Conquering her ineffable aversion for the bandit,\r\nNisida followed him hastily to the deck. At the same instant that her\r\neyes plunged, as it were, into the dense obscurity which prevailed\r\naround, the lightning streamed in long and vivid flashes over the\r\nturbulent waters, and with the roar of the billows suddenly mingled\r\ndeafening shrieks and cries--shrieks and cries of wild despair, as the\r\nlong-boat, which had been pushed away from the corsair-bark, went down\r\nat a little distance. And as the lightning played upon the raging sea,\r\nNisida and Verrina caught hurried but frightful glimpses of many human\r\nfaces, whereon was expressed the indescribable agony of the drowning.\r\n\r\n\"Perdition!\" cried Verrina; \"all are gone save Nisida and myself! And\r\nshall we too perish ere she has become mine? shall death separate us ere\r\nI have reveled in her charms? Fool that I was to delay my triumph\r\nhitherto! Fool that I was to be overawed by her impetuous signs, or\r\nmelted by her silent though strong appeals!\"\r\n\r\nHe paced the deck in an excited manner as he uttered these words aloud.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he exclaimed wildly, as the tempest seemed to increase, and the\r\nship was thrown further on shoal: \"she shall not escape me thus, after\r\nall I have done and dared in order to possess her! Our funeral may take\r\nplace to-night--but our bridal shall be first. Ha! ha!\"--and he laughed\r\nwith a kind of despairing mockery, while the fragments of the vessel's\r\nsails flapped against the spars with a din as if some mighty demon were\r\nstruggling with the blast. The sense of appalling danger seemed to\r\nmadden Stephano only because it threatened to separate him from Nisida;\r\nand, fearfully excited, he rushed toward her, crying wildly, \"You shall\r\nbe mine!\"\r\n\r\nBut how terrible was the yell which burst from his lips, when by the\r\nglare of a brilliant flash of lightning, he beheld Nisida cast herself\r\nover the side of the vessel!\r\n\r\nFor a single instant he fell back appalled, horror-struck; but at the\r\nnext, he plunged with insensate fury after her. And the rage of the\r\nstorm redoubled.\r\n\r\nWhen the misty shades of morning cleared away, and the storm had passed,\r\nNisida was seated alone upon the strand, having miraculously escaped\r\nthat eternal night of death which leads to no dawn. But where was\r\nStephano Verrina? She knew not; although she naturally conjectured, and\r\neven hoped, that he was numbered with the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFair and beauteous was the Mediterranean isle whereon the Lady Nisida\r\nhad been thrown.\r\n\r\nWhen the morning mists had dispersed, and the sunbeams tinged the ridges\r\nof the hills and the summits of the tallest trees, Nisida awoke as it\r\nwere from the profound lethargic reverie in which she had been plunged\r\nfor upward of an hour, since the moment when the billows had borne her\r\nsafely to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of that island was warm and genial, for there eternal\r\nsummer reigned, and thus, though her garments were still dripping wet,\r\nNisida experienced no cold. She rose from the bank of sand whereon she\r\nhad been seated, and cast anxious, rapid, and searching glances around\r\nher. Not a human being met her eyes; but in the woods that stretched,\r\nwith emerald pride, almost down to the golden sands, the birds and\r\ninsects--nature's free commoners--sent forth the sounds of life and\r\nwelcomed the advent of the morn with that music of the groves.\r\n\r\nThe scenery which now presented itself to the contemplation of Nisida\r\nwas indescribably beautiful. Richly wooded hills rose towering above\r\neach other with amphitheatrical effect; and behind the verdant panorama\r\nwere the blue outlines of pinnacles of naked rocks. But not a trace of\r\nthe presence of human beings was to be seen--not a hamlet, nor a\r\ncottage, nor the slightest sign of agriculture! At a short distance lay\r\na portion of the wreck of the corsair-ship. The fury of the tempest of\r\nthe preceding night had thrown it so high upon the shoal whereon it had\r\nstruck, and the sea was now comparatively so calm, that Nisida was\r\nenabled to approach close up to it. With little difficulty she succeeded\r\nin reaching the deck,--that deck whose elastic surface lately vibrated\r\nto the tread of many daring, desperate young men--but now desolate and\r\nbroken in many parts.\r\n\r\nThe cabin which had been allotted to her, or rather to which she had\r\nbeen confined, was in the portion of the wreck that still remained; and\r\nthere she found a change of raiment, which Stephano had provided ere the\r\nvessel left Leghorn. Carefully packing up these garments in as small and\r\nportable a compass as possible, she fastened the burden upon her\r\nshoulders by the means of a cord, and, quitting the vessel, conveyed it\r\nsafe and dry to the shore.\r\n\r\nThen she returned again to the wreck in search of provisions,\r\nconsiderable quantities of which she fortunately found to be uninjured\r\nby the water; and these she was enabled to transport to the strand by\r\nmeans of several journeys backward and forward between the shore and the\r\nwreck. The occupation was not only necessary in order to provide the\r\nwherewith to sustain life, but it also abstracted her thoughts from a\r\ntoo painful contemplation of her position. It was long past the hour of\r\nnoon when she had completed her task; and the shore in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the wreck was piled with a miscellaneous assortment of\r\nobjects--bags of provisions, weapons of defense, articles of the toilet,\r\nclothing, pieces of canvas, cordage, and carpenter's tools. Then,\r\nwearied with her arduous toils, she laid aside her dripping garments,\r\nbathed her beauteous form in the sea, and attired herself in dry\r\napparel.\r\n\r\nHaving partaken of some refreshment, she armed herself with weapons of\r\ndefense, and quitting the shore, entered upon that vast amphitheater of\r\nverdure to which we have already slightly alluded. The woods were thick\r\nand tangled; but though, when seen from the shore, they appeared to form\r\none dense, uninterrupted forest, yet they in reality only dotted the\r\nsurface of the islands with numerous detached patches of grove and\r\ncopse; and in the intervals were verdant plains or delicious valleys,\r\nexhibiting not the slightest sign of agriculture, but interspersed with\r\nshrubs and trees laden with fruits rich and tempting.\r\n\r\nNature had indeed profusely showered her bounties over that charming\r\nisle; for the trees glowed with their blushing or golden produce, as if\r\ngems were the fruitage of every bough.\r\n\r\nThrough one of the delicious valleys which Nisida explored, a streamlet,\r\nsmooth as a looking-glass, wound its way. To its sunny bank did the lady\r\nrepair; and the pebbly bed of the river was seen as plainly through the\r\nlimpid waters as an eyeball through a tear.\r\n\r\nThough alone was Nisida in that vale, and though many bitter\r\nreflections, deep regrets, and vague apprehensions crowded upon her\r\nsoul; yet the liveliness of the scene appeared to diminish the\r\nintenseness of the feelings of utter solitude, and its soft influence\r\npartially lulled the waves of her emotions. For never had mortal eyes\r\nbeheld finer fruit upon the trees, nor lovelier flowers upon the soil;\r\nall life was rejoicing, from the grasshopper at her feet to the\r\nfeathered songsters in the myrtle, citron, and olive groves; and the\r\nswan glided past to the music of the stream. Above, the heavens were\r\nmore clear than her own Italian clime, more blue than any color that\r\ntinges the flowers of the earth.\r\n\r\nShe roved along the smiling bank which fringed the stream until the\r\nsetting sun dyed with the richest purple the rocky pinnacles in the\r\ndistance, and made the streamlet glow like a golden flood. And\r\nNisida--alone, in the radiance and glory of her own charms--alone amidst\r\nall the radiance and glory of the charms of nature--the beauteous Nisida\r\nappeared to be the queen of that Mediterranean isle. But whether it were\r\nreally an island or a portion of the three continents which hem in that\r\ntideless ocean, the lady as yet knew not.\r\n\r\nWarned by the splendors of the setting sun to retrace her way, she\r\nturned and sped back to the strand, where the stores she had saved from\r\nthe wreck were heaped up. When first she had set out upon her exploring\r\nramble, she had expected every moment to behold human forms--her\r\nfellow-creatures--emerge from the woods; but the more she saw of that\r\ncharming spot whereon her destinies had thrown her, the fainter grew the\r\nhope or the fear--we scarcely know which to term the expectation. For no\r\nsign of the presence of man was there; Nature appeared to be the\r\nundisputed empress of that land; and Nisida returned to the shore with\r\nthe conviction that she was the sole human inhabitant of this delicious\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nAnd now, once more seated upon the strand, while the last beams of the\r\nsun played upon the wide blue waters of the Mediterranean, Nisida\r\npartook of her frugal repast, consisting of the bread supplied by the\r\nwreck and a few fruits which she gathered in the valley. The effects of\r\nthe tempest had totally disappeared in respect to the sea, which now lay\r\nstretched in glassy stillness. It seemed as if a holy calm, soft as an\r\ninfant's sleep, lay upon the bosom of the Mediterranean, now no longer\r\nterrible with storm, but a mighty emblem of mild majesty and rest!\r\n\r\nNisida thought of the fury which had lately convulsed that sea, now so\r\nplacid, and sighed at the conviction which was forced upon her--that no\r\nsuch calm was for the mortal breast when storms had once been there! For\r\nshe pondered on her native land, now, perhaps, far--oh! how far away;\r\nand the images of those whom she loved appeared to rise before\r\nher--Francisco in despair at his sister's unaccountable\r\ndisappearance--and Fernand perchance already doomed to die! And tears\r\nflowed down her cheeks, and trickled upon her snowy bosom, gleaming like\r\ndew amongst lilies. Of what avail was the energy of her character in\r\nthat land along whose coast stretched the impassable barrier of the sea?\r\nOh! it was enough to make even the haughty Nisida weep, and to produce a\r\nterrible impression on a mind hitherto acting only in obedience to its\r\nown indomitable will.\r\n\r\nThough the sun had set some time, and no moon had yet appeared in the\r\npurple sky, yet was it far from dark. An azure mantle of twilight seemed\r\nto wrap the earth--the sea--the heavens; and so soft, so overpowering\r\nwas the influence of the scene and of the night, that slumber gradually\r\nstole upon the lady's eyes. There now, upon the warm sand, slept Nisida;\r\nand when the chaste advent of the moon bathed all in silver, as the sun\r\nhad for twelve hours steeped all in gold, the beams of the goddess of\r\nthe night played on her charming countenance without awakening her. The\r\nraven masses of her hair lay upon her flushed cheeks like midnight on a\r\nbed of roses, her long black lashes reposed on those cheeks, so\r\nsurpassingly lovely with their rich carnation hues. For she dreamt of\r\nFernand; and her vision was a happy one. Imagination played wild tricks\r\nwith the shipwrecked, lonely lady, as if to recompense her for the\r\nwaking realities of her sad position. She thought that she was reposing\r\nin the delicious valley which she had explored in the afternoon--she\r\nthought that Fernand was her companion--that she lay in his arms--that\r\nhis lips pressed hers--that she was all to him as he was all to her, and\r\nthat love's cup of enjoyment was full to the very brim.\r\n\r\nBut, oh! when she slowly awoke, and under the influence of the\r\ndelightful vision, raised her eyes in the dewy light of voluptuous\r\nlanguor to the blue sky above her, the sunbeams that were heralding in\r\nanother day cruelly dispelled the enchanting illusions of a warm and\r\nexcited fancy, and Nisida found herself alone on the sea-shore of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThus the glory of that sunrise had no charms for her; although never had\r\nthe orb of day come forth with greater pomp, nor to shine on a lovelier\r\nscene. No words can convey an idea of the rapid development of every\r\nfeature in the landscape, the deeper and deepening tint of the glowing\r\nsky, the roseate hue of the mountain-peaks as they stood out against the\r\ncloudless orient, and the rich emerald shades of the woods sparkling\r\nwith fruit. The fragrant rose and the chaste lily, the blushing peony\r\nand the gaudy tulip, and all the choicest flowers of that delicious\r\nclime, expanded into renewed loveliness to greet the sun: and the citron\r\nand the orange, the melon and the grape, the pomegranate and the date\r\ndrank in the yellow light to nourish their golden hues.\r\n\r\nNisida's eyes glanced rapidly over the vast expanse of waters, and swept\r\nthe horizon: but there was not a sail, nor even a cloud which\r\nimagination might transform into the white wing of a distant ship. And\r\nnow upon the golden sand the lovely Nisida put off her garments one by\r\none: and set at liberty the dark masses of her shining hair, which\r\nfloated like an ample veil of raven blackness over the dazzling\r\nwhiteness of her skin. Imagination might have invested her forehead with\r\na halo, so magnificent was the lustrous effect of the sun upon the\r\nsilken glossiness of that luxuriant hair.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean was the lady's bath: and, in spite of the oppressive\r\nnature of the waking thoughts which had succeeded her delicious dream,\r\nin spite of that conviction of loneliness which lay like a weight of\r\nlead upon her soul, she disported in the waters like a mermaid.\r\n\r\nNow she plunged beneath the surface, which glowed in the sun like a vast\r\nlake of quicksilver: now she stood in a shallow spot, where the water\r\nrippled no higher than her middle, and combed out her dripping tresses;\r\nthen she waded further in, and seemed to rejoice in allowing the little\r\nwavelets to kiss her snowy bosom. No fear had she, indeed, no thought of\r\nthe monsters of the deep: could the fair surface of the shining water\r\nconceal aught dangerous or aught terrible? Oh! yes, even as beneath that\r\nsnowy breast beat a heart stained with crime, often agitated by ardent\r\nand impetuous passions, and devoured by raging desire.\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour did Nisida disport in Nature's mighty bath until the\r\nheat of the sun became so intense that she was compelled to return to\r\nthe shore and resume her apparel. Then she took some bread in her hand,\r\nand hastened to the groves to pluck the cooling and delicious fruits\r\nwhereof there was so marvelous an abundance. She seated herself on a bed\r\nof wild flowers on the shady side of a citron and orange grove,\r\nsurrounded by a perfumed air. Before her stretched the valley, like a\r\nvast carpet of bright green velvet fantastically embroidered with\r\nflowers of a thousand varied hues. And in the midst meandered the\r\ncrystal stream, with stately swans and an infinite number of other\r\naquatic birds floating on its bosom. And the birds of the groves, too,\r\nhow beautiful were they, and how joyous did they seem! What variegated\r\nplumage did they display, as they flew past the Lady Nisida, unscared by\r\nher presence! Some of them alighted from the overhanging boughs, and as\r\nthey descended swept her very hair with their wings; then, almost to\r\nconvince her that she was not an unwelcome intruder in that charming\r\nland, they hopped round her, picking up the crumbs of bread which she\r\nscattered about to attract them.\r\n\r\nFor the loneliness of her condition had already attuned the mind of this\r\nstrange being to a susceptibility of deriving amusement from incidents\r\nwhich a short time previously she would have looked upon as the most\r\ninsane triflings;--thus was the weariness of her thoughts relieved by\r\ndisporting in the water, as we ere now saw her, or by contemplating the\r\nplayfulness of the birds. Presently she wandered into the vale, and\r\ngathered a magnificent nosegay of flowers: then the whim struck her that\r\nshe would weave for herself a chaplet of roses; and as her work\r\nprogressed, she improved upon it, and fashioned a beauteous diadem of\r\nflowers to protect her head from the scorching noonday sun.\r\n\r\nBut think not, O reader! that while thus diverting herself with\r\ntrivialities of which you would scarcely have deemed the\r\nhaughty--imperious--active disposition of Nisida of Riverola to be\r\ncapable--think not that her mind was altogether abstracted from\r\nunpleasant thoughts. No--far, very far from that! She was merely\r\nrelieved from a portion of that weight which oppressed her; but her\r\nentire burden could not be removed from her soul. There were moments\r\nwhen her grief amounted almost to despair. Was she doomed to pass the\r\nremainder of her existence in that land? was it really an island and\r\nunknown to navigators? She feared so: for did it join a continent, its\r\nloveliness and fruitfulness would not have permitted it to remain long\r\nunoccupied by those who must of necessity discover it.\r\n\r\nAnd oh! what would her brother think of her absence? what would Fernand\r\nconjecture? And what perils might not at that moment envelop her lover,\r\nwhile she was not near to succor him by means of her artifice, her\r\nmachinations, or her gold. Ten thousand-thousand maledictions upon\r\nStephano, who was the cause of all her present misery! Ten\r\nthousand-thousand maledictions on her own folly for not having exerted\r\nall her energies and all her faculties to escape from his power, ere she\r\nwas conveyed on board the corsair ship, and it was too late!\r\n\r\nBut useless now were regrets and repinings; for the past could not be\r\nrecalled, and the future might have much happiness in store for Nisida.\r\nFor oh! sweetest comes the hope which is lured back because its presence\r\nis indispensable; and, oppressed as Nisida was with the weight of her\r\nmisfortunes, her soul was too energetic, too sanguine, too impetuous to\r\nyield to despair.\r\n\r\nDay after day passed, and still not a ship appeared. Nisida did not\r\npenetrate much further into the island than the valley which we have\r\ndescribed, and whither she was accustomed to repair to gather the\r\nflowers that she wove into diadems. She lingered for the most part near\r\nthe shore on which she had been thrown, fearing lest, if away, a ship\r\nmight pass in her absence.\r\n\r\nEach day she bathed her beauteous form in the Mediterranean; each day\r\nshe devoted some little time to the adornment of her person with wreaths\r\nof flowers. She wove crowns for her head--necklaces, bracelets, and\r\nscarfs,--combining the flowers so as to form the most wild and fanciful\r\ndevices, and occasionally surveying herself in the natural mirror\r\nafforded her by the limpid stream. Purposely wearing an apparel as\r\nscanty as possible, on account of the oppressive heat which prevailed\r\nduring each day of twelve long hours, and which was not materially\r\nmoderated at night, she supplied to some extent the place of the\r\nsuperfluous garments thus thrown aside, by means of tissues of cool,\r\nrefreshing, fragrant flowers.\r\n\r\nThus, by the time she had been ten or twelve days upon the island, her\r\nappearance seemed most admirably to correspond with her new and lonely\r\nmode of life, and the spot where her destinies had cast her. Habited in\r\na single linen garment, confined round the slender waist with a cestus\r\nof flowers, and with light slippers upon her feet, but with a diadem of\r\nroses on her head, and with wreaths round her bare arms, and her equally\r\nbare ankles, she appeared to be the goddess of that island--the genius\r\nof that charming clime of fruits, and verdure, and crystal streams, and\r\nflowers. The majesty of her beauty was softened, and thus enhanced, by\r\nthe wonderful simplicity of her attire; the dazzling brilliancy of her\r\ncharms was subdued by the chaste, the innocent, the primitive aspect\r\nwith which those fantastically woven flowers invested her. Even the\r\nextraordinary luster of her fine dark eyes was moderated by the gaudy\r\nyet elegant assemblage of hues formed by those flowers which she wore.\r\nWas it not strange that she whose soul we have hitherto seen bent on\r\ndeeds or schemes of stern and important nature--who never acted without\r\na motive, and whose mind was far too deeply occupied with worldly cares\r\nand pursuits to bestow a thought on trifles--who, indeed, would have\r\ndespised herself had she wasted a moment in toying with a flower, or\r\nwatching the playful motions of a bird,--was it not strange that Nisida\r\nshould have become so changed as we now find her in that island of which\r\nshe was the queen?\r\n\r\nConceive that same Nisida who planned dark plots against Flora\r\nFrancatelli, now tripping along the banks of the sunlit stream, bedecked\r\nwith flowers and playing with the swans. Imagine that same being, who\r\ndealt death to Agnes, now seated beneath the shade of myrtles and\r\nembowering vines, distributing bread or pomegranate seeds to the birds\r\nthat hopped cheerfully around her. Picture to yourself that woman of\r\nmajestic beauty, whom you have seen clad in black velvet and wearing a\r\ndark thick veil, now weaving for herself garments of flowers, and\r\nwandering in the lightest possible attire by the seashore, or by the\r\nrippling stream, or amidst the mazes of the fruit-laden groves.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes, as she sat upon the yellow sand, gazing on the wavelets\r\nof the Mediterranean, that were racing one after another, like living\r\nthings from some far off region, to that lovely but lonely isle, it\r\nwould seem as if all the low and sweet voices of the sea--never loud and\r\nsullen now, since the night of storm which cast her on that strand--were\r\nheard by her, and made delicious music to her ears! In that island must\r\nwe leave her now for a short space,--leave her to her birds, her\r\nflowers, and her mermaid-sports in the sea,--leave her also to her\r\nintervals of dark and dismal thoughts, and to her long, but ineffectual\r\nwatchings for the appearance of a sail in the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE WEHR-WOLF.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of the month; and the hour of sunset was fast\r\napproaching. Great was the sensation that prevailed throughout the city\r\nof Florence. Rumor had industriously spread, and with equal assiduity\r\nexaggerated, the particulars of Fernand Wagner's trial, and the belief\r\nthat a man on whom the horrible destiny of a Wehr-Wolf had been\r\nentailed, was about to suffer the extreme penalty of the law, was\r\ngenerally prevalent.\r\n\r\nThe great square of the ducal palace, where the scaffold was erected, was\r\ncrowded with the Florentine populace; and the windows were literally alive\r\nwith human faces. Various were the emotions and feelings which influenced\r\nthat mass of spectators. The credulous and superstitious--forming more\r\nthan nine-tenths of the whole multitude--shook their heads, and\r\ncommented amongst themselves, in subdued whispers, on the profane\r\nrashness of the chief judge, who dared to doubt the existence of such a\r\nbeing as a Wehr-Wolf. The few who shared the skepticism of the judge\r\napplauded that high functionary for his courage in venturing so bold a\r\nstroke in order to destroy what he and they deemed an idle superstition.\r\n\r\nBut the great mass were dominated by a profound and indeed most painful\r\nsensation of awe; curiosity induced them to remain, though their\r\nmisgivings prompted them to fly from the spot which had been fixed upon\r\nfor the execution. The flowers of Florentine loveliness--and never in\r\nany age did the republic boast of so much female beauty--were present:\r\nbut bright eyes flashed forth uneasy glances, and snowy bosoms beat with\r\nalarms, and fair hands trembled in the lover's pressure. In the midst of\r\nthe square was raised a high platform covered with black cloth, and\r\npresenting an appearance so ominous and sinister that it was but little\r\ncalculated to revive the spirits of the timid. On this scaffold was a\r\nhuge block: and near the block stood the headsman, carelessly leaning on\r\nhis ax, the steel of which was polished and bright as silver. A few\r\nminutes before the hour of sunset, the chief judge, the procurator\r\nfiscal, the two assistant-judges, and the lieutenant of sbirri, attended\r\nby a turnkey and several subordinate police officers, were repairing in\r\nprocession along the corridor leading to the doomed prisoner's cell.\r\n\r\nThe chief judge alone was dignified in manner; and he alone wore a\r\ndemeanor denoting resolution and at the same time self-possession. Those\r\nwho accompanied him were, without a single exception, a prey to the most\r\nlively fear; and it was evident that had they dared to absent themselves\r\nthey would not have been present on this occasion. At length the door of\r\nthe prisoner's cell was reached; and there the procession paused.\r\n\r\n\"The moment is now at hand,\" said the chief judge, \"when a monstrous and\r\nridiculous superstition, imported into our country from that cradle and\r\nnurse of preposterous legends--Germany--shall be annihilated forever.\r\nThis knave who is about to suffer has doubtless propagated the report of\r\nhis lupine destiny, in order to inspire terror and thus prosecute his\r\ncareer of crime and infamy with the greater security from chances of\r\nmolestation. For this end he painted the picture which appalled so many\r\nof you in the judgment hall, but which, believe, my friends, he did not\r\nalways believe destined to retain its sable covering. Well did he know\r\nthat the curiosity of a servant or of a friend would obtain a peep\r\nbeneath the mystic veil; and he calculated that the terror with which he\r\nsought to invest himself would be enhanced by the rumors and\r\nrepresentations spread by those who had thus penetrated into its feigned\r\nsecrets. But let us not waste that time which now verges toward a\r\ncrisis, whereby doubt shall be dispelled and a ridiculous superstition\r\ndestroyed forever.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a loud, a piercing, and an agonizing cry burst from the\r\ninterior of the cell.\r\n\r\n\"The knave has overheard me, and would fain strike terror to your\r\nhearts!\" exclaimed the chief judge; then in a still louder tone, he\r\ncommanded the turnkey to open the door of the dungeon. But when the man\r\napproached, so strange, so awful, so appalling were the sounds which\r\ncame from the interior of the cell, that he threw down the key in dismay\r\nand rushed from the dreadful vicinity.\r\n\r\n\"My lord, I implore you to pause!\" said the procurator fiscal, trembling\r\nfrom head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Would you have me render myself ridiculous in the eyes of all\r\nFlorence?\" demanded the chief judge sternly.\r\n\r\nYet, so strange were now the noises which came from the interior of the\r\ndungeon--so piercing the cries of agony--so violent the rustling and\r\ntossing on the stone floor, that for the first time this bold\r\nfunctionary entertained a partial misgiving, as if he had indeed gone\r\ntoo far. But to retreat was impossible; and, with desperate resolution,\r\nthe chief judge picked up the key and thrust it into the lock.\r\n\r\nHis assistants, the procurator fiscal, and the sbirri drew back with\r\ninstinctive horror, as the bolts groaned in the iron work which held\r\nthem; the chain fell with a clanking sound; and as the door was opened,\r\nthe horrible monster burst forth from the dungeon with a terrific howl.\r\nYells and cries of despair reverberated through the long corridor: and\r\nthose sounds were for an instant broken by that of the falling of a\r\nheavy body.\r\n\r\n'Twas the chief judge, hurled down and dashed violently against the\r\nrough uneven masonry, by the mad careering of the Wehr-Wolf as the\r\nmonster burst from his cell. On, on he sped, with the velocity of\r\nlightning, along the corridor, giving vent to howls of the most\r\nhorrifying description.\r\n\r\nFainting with terror, the assistant judges, the procurator fiscal, and\r\nthe sbirri were for a few moments so overcome by the appalling scene\r\nthey had just witnessed, that they thought not of raising the chief\r\njudge, who lay motionless on the pavement. But at length some of the\r\npolice-officers so far recovered themselves as to be able to devote\r\nattention to that high functionary--it was, however, too late--his skull\r\nwas fractured by the violence with which he had been dashed against the\r\nrough wall, and his brains were scattered on the pavement. Those who now\r\nbent over his disfigured corpse exchanged looks of unutterable horror.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Wehr-Wolf had cleared the corridor, rapid as an\r\narrow shot from the bow; he sprung, bounding up a flight of steep stone\r\nstairs as if the elastic air bore him on, and rushing through an open\r\ndoor, burst suddenly upon the crowd that was so anxiously waiting to\r\nbehold the procession issue thence.\r\n\r\nTerrific was the yell that the multitude sent forth--a yell formed of a\r\nthousand combining voices, so long, so loud, so wildly agonizing, that\r\nnever had the welkin rung with so appalling an ebullition of human\r\nmisery before! Madly rushed the wolf amidst the people, dashing them\r\naside, overturning them, hurling them down, bursting through the mass\r\ntoo dense to clear a passage of its own accord, and making the scene of\r\nhorror more horrible still by mingling his hideous howlings with the\r\ncries--the shrieks--the screams that escaped from a thousand tongues.\r\n\r\nNo pen can describe the awful scene of confusion and death which now\r\ntook place. Swayed by no panic fear, but influenced by terrors of\r\ndreadful reality, the people exerted all their force to escape from that\r\nspot; and thus the struggling, crushing, pushing, crowding, fighting,\r\nand all the oscillations of a multitude set in motion by the direst\r\nalarms, were succeeded by the most fatal results. Women were thrown down\r\nand trampled to death, strong men were scarcely able to maintain their\r\nfooting, many females were literally suffocated in the pressure of the\r\ncrowd, and mothers with young children in their arms excited no\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nNever was the selfishness of human nature more strikingly displayed than\r\non this occasion: no one bestowed a thought upon his neighbor: the\r\nchivalrous Florentine citizens dashed aside the weak and helpless female\r\nwho barred his way with as little remorse as if she were not a being of\r\nflesh and blood; and even husbands forgot their wives, lovers abandoned\r\ntheir mistresses, and parents waited not an instant to succor their\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nOh! it was a terrible thing to contemplate, that dense mass, oscillating\r\nfuriously like the waves of the sea, sending up to heaven such appalling\r\nsounds of misery, rushing furiously toward the avenues of egress,\r\nfalling back baffled and crushed, in the struggle where only the very\r\nstrongest prevailed, laboring to escape from death, and fighting for\r\nlife, fluctuating and rushing, and wailing in maddening excitement like\r\na raging ocean. Oh! all this wrought a direful sublimity, with those\r\ncries of agony and that riot of desperation. And all this while the wolf\r\npursued its furious career, amid the mortal violence of a people thrown\r\ninto horrible disorder, pursued its way with savage howls, glaring eyes,\r\nand foaming mouth, the only living being there that was infuriate and\r\nnot alarmed, battling for escape, and yet unhurt.\r\n\r\nAs a whirlpool suddenly assails the gallant ship, makes her agitate and\r\nrock fearfully for a few moments and then swallows her up altogether, so\r\nwas the scaffold in the midst of the square shaken to its very basis for\r\na little space, and then hurled down, disappearing altogether amidst the\r\nliving vortex.\r\n\r\nIn the balconies and at the windows overlooking the square, the awful\r\nexcitement spread like wild-fire, and a real panic prevailed among those\r\nwho were at least beyond the reach of danger. But horror paralyzed the\r\npower of sober reflection, and the hideous spectacle of volumes of human\r\nbeings battling, and roaring, and rushing, and yelling in terrific\r\nfrenzy, produced a kindred effect, and spread the wild delirium among\r\nthe spectators at those balconies and those windows. At length, in the\r\nsquare below, the crowds began to pour forth from the gates, for the\r\nWehr-Wolf had by this time cleared himself a passage and escaped from\r\nthe midst of that living ocean so fearfully agitated by the storms of\r\nfear. But even when the means of egress were thus obtained, the most\r\nfrightful disorder prevailed, the people rolling in heaps upon heaps,\r\nwhile infuriate and agile men ran on the tops of the compact masses, and\r\nleapt in their delirium, as with barbarous intent.\r\n\r\nOn--on sped the Wehr-Wolf, dashing like a whirlwind through the streets\r\nleading to the open country, the white flakes of foam flying from his\r\nmouth like spray from the prow of a vessel, and every fiber of his frame\r\nvibrating as if in agony. And oh! what dismay--what terror did that\r\nmonster spread in the thoroughfares through which he passed; how wildly,\r\nhow madly flew the men and women from his path; how piteously screamed\r\nthe children at the house-doors in the poor neighborhoods! But, as if\r\nsated with the destruction already wrought in the great square of the\r\npalace, the wolf dealt death no more in the precincts of the city; as if\r\nlashed on by invisible demons, his aim, or his instinct, was to escape.\r\n\r\nThe streets are threaded, the suburbs of the city are passed, the open\r\ncountry is gained; and now along the bank of the Arno rushes the\r\nmonster, by the margin of that pure stream to whose enchanting vale the\r\nsoft twilight lends a more delicious charm.\r\n\r\nOn the verge of a grove, with its full budding branches all impatient\r\nfor the spring, a lover and his mistress were murmuring fond language to\r\neach other. In the soft twilight blushed the maiden, less in bashfulness\r\nthan in her own soul's emotion, her countenance displaying all the magic\r\nbeauty not only of feature but of feeling; and she raised her large blue\r\neyes in the dewy light of a sweet enthusiasm to the skies, as the\r\nhandsome youth by her side pressed her fair hand and said, \"We must now\r\npart until to-morrow, darling of my soul! How calmly has this day, with\r\nall its life and brightness, passed away into the vast tomb of eternity.\r\nIt is gone without a single hour's unhappiness for us--gone without\r\nleaving a regret on our minds--gone, too, without clouds in the heavens\r\nor mists upon the earth, most beautiful even at the moment of its\r\nparting! Tomorrow, beloved one, will unite us again in your parents'\r\ncot, and renewed happiness----\"\r\n\r\nThe youth stopped, and the maiden clung to him in speechless terror: for\r\nan ominous sound, as of a rushing animal and then a terrific howl, burst\r\nupon their ears! No time had they for flight, not a moment even to\r\ncollect their scattered thoughts. The infuriate wolf came bounding over\r\nthe greensward, the youth uttered a wild and fearful cry, a scream of\r\nagony burst from the lips of the maiden as she was dashed from her\r\nlover's arms, and in another moment the monster had swept by.\r\n\r\nBut what misery, what desolation had his passage wrought! Though unhurt\r\nby his glistening fangs--though unwounded by his sharp claws, yet the\r\nmaiden--an instant before so enchanting in her beauty, so happy in her\r\nlove--lay stretched on the cold turf, the cords of life snapped suddenly\r\nby that transition from perfect bliss to the most appalling terror!\r\n\r\nAnd still the wolf rushed madly, wildly on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was an hour past sunrise; and from a grove in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of Leghorn a man came forth. His countenance, though\r\nwondrously handsome, was deadly pale; traces of mental horror and\r\nanguish remained on those classically chiseled features, and in those\r\nfine eloquent eyes. His garments were soiled, blood-stained, and torn.\r\n\r\nThis man was Fernand Wagner. He entered the city of Leghorn, and\r\npurchased a change of attire, for which he paid from a purse well filled\r\nwith gold. He then repaired to a hostel, or public tavern, where he\r\nperformed the duties of the toilet, and obtained the refreshment of\r\nwhich he appeared to stand so much in need. By this time his countenance\r\nwas again composed; and the change which new attire and copious ablution\r\nhad made in his appearance, was so great that no one who had seen him\r\nissue from the grove and beheld him now, could have believed in the\r\nidentity of the person. Quitting the hostel, he repaired to the port,\r\nwhere he instituted inquiries relative to a particular vessel which he\r\ndescribed, and which had sailed from Leghorn upward of a fortnight\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nHe soon obtained the information which he sought; and an old sailor, to\r\nwhom he had addressed himself, not only hinted that the vessel in\r\nquestion was suspected, when in the harbor, to be of piratical\r\ncharacter, but also declared that he himself had seen a lady conveyed on\r\nboard during the night preceding the departure of the ship. Further\r\ninquiries convinced Wagner that the lady spoken of had been carried by\r\nforce, and against her will, to the corsair vessel; and he was now\r\ncertain that the demon had not deceived him, and that he had indeed\r\nobtained a trace of his lost Nisida!\r\n\r\nHis mind was immediately resolved how to act; and his measures were as\r\nspeedily taken.\r\n\r\nGuided by the advice of the old sailor from whom he had gleaned the\r\ninformation he sought, he was enabled to purchase a fine vessel and\r\nequip her for sea within the space of a few days. He lavished his gold\r\nwith no niggard hand, and gold is a wondrous talisman to remove\r\nobstacles and facilitate designs. In a word, on the sixth morning after\r\nhis arrival at Leghorn, Fernand Wagner embarked on board his ship, which\r\nwas manned with a gallant crew, and carried ten pieces of ordnance. A\r\nfavoring breeze prevailed at the time, and the gallant bark set sail for\r\nthe Levant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nWAGNER IN SEARCH OF NISIDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps be surprised that Fernand Wagner should have been\r\nventurous enough to trust himself to the possibilities of a protracted\r\nvoyage, since every month his form must undergo a frightful change--a\r\ndestiny which he naturally endeavored to shroud in the profoundest\r\nsecrecy.\r\n\r\nBut it must be recollected that the Mediterranean is dotted with\r\nnumerous islands; and he knew that, however changeable or adverse the\r\nwinds might be, it would always prove an easy matter to make such\r\narrangements as to enable him to gain some port a few days previously to\r\nthe close of the month. Moreover, so strong, so intense was his love for\r\nNisida, that, even without the prospect afforded by this calculation, he\r\nwould have dared all perils, incurred all risks, exposed himself to all\r\nhostile chances, rather than have remained inactive while he believed\r\nher to be in the power of a desperate, ruthless bandit. For, oh! ever\r\npresent to his mind was the image of the lost fair one; by day, when the\r\nsun lighted up with smiles the dancing waves over which his vessel\r\nbounded merrily, merrily; and by night, when the moon shone like a\r\nsilver lamp amidst the curtains of heaven's pavilion.\r\n\r\nHis was not the love which knows only passionate impulse: it was a\r\nconstant, unvarying tender sentiment--far, far more pure, and therefore\r\nmore permanent, than the ardent and burning love which Nisida felt for\r\nhim. His was not the love which possession would satiate and enjoyment\r\ncool down: it was a feeling that had gained a soft yet irresistible\r\nempire over his heart.\r\n\r\nAnd that love of his was nurtured and sustained by the most generous\r\nthoughts. He pictured to himself the happiness he should experience in\r\nbecoming the constant companion of one whose loss of hearing and of\r\nspeech cut her off as it were from that communion with the world which\r\nis so grateful to her sex: he imagined to himself, with all the fond\r\nidolatry of sincere affection, how melodiously soft, how tremulously\r\nclear would be her voice, were it restored to her, and were it first\r\nused to articulate the delicious language of love. And then he thought\r\nhow enchanting, how fascinating, how fraught with witching charms, would\r\nbe the conversation of a being endowed with so glorious an intellect,\r\nwere she able to enjoy the faculty of speech. Thus did her very\r\nimperfections constitute a ravishing theme for his meditation; and the\r\nmore he indulged in dreams like these, the more resolute did he become\r\nnever to rest until he had discovered and rescued her.\r\n\r\nSeven days had elapsed since the ship sailed from Leghorn; and Sicily\r\nhad already been passed by, when the heavens grew overclouded, and\r\neverything portended a storm. The captain, whom Wagner had placed in\r\ncharge of his vessel, adopted all the precautions necessary to encounter\r\nthe approaching tempest; and soon after the sun went down on the seventh\r\nnight a hurricane suddenly swept the surface of the Mediterranean. The\r\nship bent to the fury of the gust--her very yards were deep in the\r\nwater. But when the rage of that dreadful squall subsided, the gallant\r\nbark righted again, and bounded triumphantly over the foaming waves.\r\n\r\nA night profoundly dark set in; but the white crests of the billows were\r\nvisible through that dense obscurity: while the tempest rapidly\r\nincreased in violence, and all the dread voices of the storm, the\r\nthunder in the heavens, the roaring of the sea, and the gushing sounds\r\nof the gale, proclaimed the fierceness of the elemental war. The wind\r\nblew not with that steadiness which the skill of the sailor and the\r\ncapacity of the noble ship were competent to meet, but in long and\r\nfrequent gusts of intermittent fury. Now rose the gallant bark on the\r\nwaves, as if towering toward the starless sky, in the utter blackness of\r\nwhich the masts were lost; then it sank down into the abyss, the foam of\r\nthe boiling billows glistening far above, on all sides, amidst the\r\nobscurity. What strange and appalling noises are heard on board a ship\r\nlaboring in a storm--the cracking of timber, the creaking of elastic\r\nplanks, the rattling of the cordage, the flapping of fragments of sails,\r\nthe failing of spars, the rolling of casks got loose, and at times a\r\ntremendous crash throughout the vessel, as if the whole framework were\r\ngiving way and the very sides collapsing!\r\n\r\nAnd amidst those various noises and the dread sounds of the storm, the\r\nvoices of the sailors were heard--not in prayer nor subdued by\r\nterror--but echoing the orders issued by the captain, who did not\r\ndespair of guiding--nay, fighting, as it were, the ship through the\r\ntumultuous billows and against the terrific blast.\r\n\r\nAgain a tremendous hurricane swept over the deep: it passed, but not a\r\nspar remained to the dismantled bark. The tapering masts, the long\r\ngraceful yards were gone, the cordage having snapped at every point\r\nwhere its support was needed--snapped by the fury of the tempest, as if\r\nwantonly cut by a sharp knife. The boats--the crew's last alternative of\r\nhope--had likewise disappeared. The ship was now completely at the mercy\r\nof the wild raging of the winds and the fury of the troubled waters; it\r\nno longer obeyed its helm, and there were twenty men separated, all save\r\n_one_, from death only by a few planks and a few nails! The sea now\r\nbroke so frequently over the vessel that the pumps could scarcely keep\r\nher afloat; and at length, while it was yet dark, though verging toward\r\nthe dawn, the sailors abandoned their task of working at those pumps.\r\nVainly did the captain endeavor to exercise his authority--vainly did\r\nWagner hold out menaces and promises by turns; death seemed imminent,\r\nand yet those men, who felt that they were hovering on the verge of\r\ndestruction, flew madly to the wine-stores.\r\n\r\nThen commenced a scene of the wildest disorder amidst those desperate\r\nmen; and even the captain himself, perceiving that they could laugh, and\r\nshout, and sing, in the delirium of intoxication, rushed from the side\r\nof Wagner and joined the rest. It was dreadful to hear the obscene jest,\r\nthe ribald song, and the reckless execration, sent forth from the cabin,\r\nas if in answer to the awful voices in which Nature was then speaking to\r\nthe world. But scarcely had a faint gleam appeared in the orient\r\nsky--not quite a gleam, but a mitigation of the intenseness of the\r\nnight--when a tremendous wave--a colossus amongst giants--broke over the\r\nill-fated ship, while a terrible crash of timber was for a moment heard\r\nin unison with the appalling din of the whelming billows. Wagner was the\r\nonly soul on deck at that instant: but the fury of the waters tore him\r\naway from the bulwark to which he had been clinging, and he became\r\ninsensible.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke from the stupor into which he had been plunged, it was\r\nstill dusk, and the roar of the ocean sounded in his ears with deafening\r\ndin.\r\n\r\nBut he was on land, though where he knew not. Rising from the sand on\r\nwhich he had been cast, he beheld the billows breaking on the shore at\r\nthe distance of only a few paces; and he retreated further from their\r\nreach. Then he sat down, with his face toward the east, anxiously\r\nawaiting the appearance of the morn that he might ascertain the nature\r\nand the aspect of the land on which he had been cast. By degrees the\r\nglimmering which had already subdued the blackness of night into the\r\nless profound obscurity of duskiness, grew stronger; and a yellow\r\nluster, as of a far-distant conflagration, seemed to struggle against a\r\nthick fog. Then a faint roseate streak tinged the eastern horizon,\r\ngrowing gradually deeper in hue, and spreading higher and wider--the\r\nharbinger of sunrise; while, simultaneously, the features of the land on\r\nwhich Wagner was thrown began to develop themselves like specters\r\nstealing out of complete security; till at length the orient luster was\r\ncaught successively by a thousand lofty pinnacles of rock; and finally\r\nthe majestic orb itself appeared, lighting up a series of verdant\r\nplains, delicious groves, glittering lakes, pellucid streams, as well as\r\nthe still turbulent ocean and the far-off mountains which had first\r\npeeped from amidst the darkness.\r\n\r\nFair and delightful was the scene that thus developed itself to the eyes\r\nof Wagner; but as his glance swept the country which rose\r\namphitheatrically from the shore not a vestige of the presence of man\r\ncould be beheld. No smoke curled from amidst the groves, no church spire\r\npeeped from amongst the trees; nor had the wilderness of nature been\r\ndisturbed by artificial culture.\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the ocean; there was not a trace of his vessel to be\r\nseen. But further along the sand lay a dark object, which he approached,\r\nwith a shudder, for he divined what it was.\r\n\r\nNor was he mistaken; it was the swollen and livid corpse of one of the\r\nsailors of his lost ship.\r\n\r\nWagner's first impulse was to turn away in disgust, but a better feeling\r\nalmost immediately animated him: and, hastening to the nearest grove, he\r\nbroke off a large bough, with which he hollowed a grave in the sand. He\r\ndeposited the corpse in the hole, throwing back the sand which he had\r\ndisplaced, and thus completed his Christian task.\r\n\r\nDuring his visit to the grove, he had observed with delight that the\r\ntrees were laden with fruit; and he now returned thither to refresh\r\nhimself by means of the banquet thus bountifully supplied by nature.\r\nHaving terminated his repast, he walked further inland. The verdant\r\nslope stretched up before him, variegated with flowers, and glittering\r\nwith morning dew. As he advanced, the development of all the features of\r\nthat land--lakes and woods; hills undulating like the sea in sunset,\r\nafter hours of tempest: rivulets and crystal streams, each with its own\r\npeculiar murmurs, but all of melody; groves teeming with the most\r\nluxurious fruit of the tropics, and valleys carpeted with the brightest\r\ngreen, varied with nature's own embroidery of flowers--the development\r\nof this scene was inexpressibly beautiful, far surpassing the finest\r\nefforts of creative fancy.\r\n\r\nWagner seated himself on a sunny bank, and fell into a profound\r\nmeditation. At length, glancing rapidly around, he exclaimed aloud, as\r\nif in continuation of the chain of thoughts which had already occupied\r\nhis mind, \"Oh, if Nisida were here--here, in this delicious clime, to be\r\nmy companion! What happiness--what joy! Never should I regret the world\r\nfrom which this isle--for an isle it must be--is separated! Never should\r\nI long to return to that communion with men from which we should be cut\r\noff! Here would the eyes of my Nisida cast forth rays of joy and\r\ngladness upon everything around; here would the sweetest transitions of\r\nsentiment and feeling take place! Nisida would be the island queen; she\r\nshould deck herself with these flowers, which her fair hands might weave\r\ninto wildly fantastic arabesques! Oh! all would be happiness--a\r\nhappiness so serene, that never would the love of mortals he more truly\r\nblessed! But, alas!\" he added, as a dreadful thought broke rudely upon\r\nthis delightful vision, \"I should be compelled to reveal to her my\r\nsecret--the appalling secret of my destiny: that when the period for\r\ntransformation came round, she might place herself in safety----\"\r\n\r\nWagner stopped abruptly, and rose hastily from his seat on the sunny\r\nbank. The remembrance of this dreadful fate had spoiled one of the most\r\ndelicious waking dreams in which he had ever indulged; and, dashing his\r\nhands against his forehead, he rushed wildly toward the chain of\r\nmountains which intersected the island.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he stopped short, for on the ground before him lay the\r\ndoublet of a man--a doublet of the fashion then prevalent in Italy. He\r\nlifted it up, examined it, but found nothing in the pockets; then,\r\nthrowing it on the ground, he stood contemplating it for some minutes.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that he was in some part of Italy? that the ship\r\nhad been carried back to the European Continent during the tempest of\r\nthe night? No; it was impossible that so lovely a tract of land would\r\nremain uninhabited, if known to men. The longer he reflected the more he\r\nbecame convinced that he was on some island hitherto unknown to\r\nnavigators, and on which some other shipwrecked individual had probably\r\nbeen cast. Why the doublet should have been discarded he could well\r\nunderstand, as it was thick and heavy, and the heat of the sun was\r\nalready intense, although it was not yet near the meridian.\r\n\r\nRaising his eyes from the doublet which had occasioned these\r\nreflections, he happened to glance toward a knot of fruit trees at a\r\nlittle distance; and his attention was drawn to a large bough which hung\r\ndown as if almost broken away from the main stem. He approached the\r\nlittle grove; and several circumstances now confirmed his suspicion that\r\nhe was not the only tenant of the island at that moment. The bough had\r\nbeen forcibly torn down, and very recently, too; several of the fruits\r\nhad been plucked off, the little sprigs to which they had originally\r\nhung still remaining and bearing evidence to the fact. But if additional\r\nproof were wanting of human presence there, it was afforded by the\r\nhalf-eaten fruits that were strewed about.\r\n\r\nWagner now searched for the traces of footsteps; but such marks were not\r\nlikely to remain in the thick rich grass, which if trampled down, would\r\nrise fresh and elastic again with the invigorating dew of a single\r\nnight. The grove, where Wagner observed the broken bough and the\r\nscattered fruits, was further from the shore than the spot where he had\r\nfound the doublet; and he reasoned that the man, whoever he might be,\r\nhad thrown away his garment, when overpowered by the intensity of the\r\nheat, and had then sought the shade and refreshment afforded by the\r\ngrove. He therefore concluded that he had gone inland, most probably\r\ntoward the mountains, whose rocky pinnacles, of every form, now shone\r\nwith every hue in the glorious sunlight.\r\n\r\nOverjoyed at the idea of finding a human being in a spot which he had at\r\nfirst deemed totally uninhabited, and filled with the hope that the\r\nstranger might be able to give him some information relative to the\r\ngeographical position of the isle, and even perhaps aid him in forming a\r\nraft by which they might together escape from the oasis of the\r\nMediterranean, Wagner proceeded toward the mountains. By degrees the\r\nwondrous beauty of the scene became wilder, more imposing, but less\r\nbewitching, and when he reached the acclivities of the hill, the groves\r\nof fruits and copses of myrtles and citrons, of vines and almond shrubs,\r\nwere succeeded by woods of mighty trees.\r\n\r\nFurther on still the forests ceased and Fernand entered on a wild region\r\nof almost universal desolation, yet forming one of the sublimest\r\nspectacles that nature can afford. The sounds of torrents, as yet\r\nconcealed from his view, and resembling the murmur of ocean's waves,\r\ninspired feelings of awe; and it was now for the first time since he\r\nentered on the region of desolation, having left the clime of loveliness\r\nnearly a mile behind, that his attention was drawn to the nature of the\r\nsoil, which was hard and bituminous in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe truth almost immediately struck him: there was a volcano amongst\r\nthose mountains up which he was ascending; and it was the lava which had\r\nproduced that desolation, and which, cold and hardened, formed the soil\r\nwhereon he walked. It was now past midday; and he seated himself once\r\nmore to repose his limbs, wearied with the fatigues of the ascent and\r\novercome by the heat that was there intolerable. At the distance of\r\nabout two hundred yards on his right was a solitary tree, standing like\r\na sign to mark the tomb of nature's vegetation. Upon this tree his eyes\r\nwere fixed listlessly, and he was marveling within himself how that\r\nsingle scion of the forest could have been spared, when the burning\r\nlava, whenever the eruption might have taken place, had hurled down and\r\nreduced to cinders its verdant brethren.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his attention was more earnestly riveted upon the dense and\r\nwide-spreading foliage of that tree; for the boughs were shaken in an\r\nextraordinary manner, and something appeared to be moving about amongst\r\nthe canopy of leaves. In another minute a long, unmistakable, appalling\r\nobject darted forth--a monstrous snake--suspending itself by the tail to\r\none of the lower boughs, and disporting playfully with its hideous head\r\ntoward the ground. Then, with a sudden coil, it drew itself back into\r\nthe tree, the entire foliage of which was shaken with the horrible\r\ngambolings of the reptile.\r\n\r\nWagner remembered the frightful spectacle which he had beholden in\r\nCeylon, and an awful shudder crept through his frame; for, although he\r\nknew that he bore a charmed life, yet he shrank with a loathing from the\r\nidea of having to battle with such a horrible serpent. Starting from the\r\nground, he rushed--flew, rather than ran, higher up the acclivity, and\r\nspeedily entered on a wild scene of rugged and barren rocks: but he\r\ncared not whither the windings of the natural path which he now pursued\r\nmight lead him, since he had escaped from the view of the hideous\r\nboa-constrictor gamboling in the solitary tree.\r\n\r\nWearied with his wanderings, and sinking beneath the oppressive heat of\r\nthe sun, Wagner was rejoiced to find a cavern in the side of a rock,\r\nwhere he might shelter and repose himself. He entered, and lay down upon\r\nthe hard soil; the sounds of the torrents, which rolled still unseen\r\namidst the chasms toward which he had approached full near, produced a\r\nlulling influence upon him, and in a few minutes his eyes were sealed in\r\nslumber. When he awoke he found himself in total darkness. He started\r\nup, collected his scattered ideas, and advanced to the mouth of the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set: but outside the cave an azure twilight prevailed, and\r\nthe adjacent peaks of the mountains stood darkly out from the partially\r\nthough faintly illuminated sky.\r\n\r\nWhile Wagner was gazing long and intently upon the sublime grandeur of\r\nthe scene, a strange phenomenon took place. First a small cloud appeared\r\non the summit of an adjacent hill; then gradually this cloud became more\r\ndense and assumed a human shape. Oh! with what interest--what deep,\r\nenthusiastic interest, did Fernand contemplate the spectacle; for his\r\nwell-stored mind at once suggested to him that he was now the witness of\r\nthat wondrous optical delusion, called the mirage.\r\n\r\nSome human being in the plain on the other side of that range of\r\nmountains was the subject of that sublime scene; might it not be the\r\nindividual of whom he was in search, the owner of the doublet? But, ah!\r\nwherefore does Wagner start with surprise?\r\n\r\nThe shadow of that human being, as it gradually assumed greater density\r\nand a more defined shape--in a word, as it was now properly developed by\r\nthe reflection of twilight--wore the form of a female! Were there, then,\r\nmany inhabitants on the opposite side of the mountains? or was there\r\nonly one female, she whose reflected image he now beheld? He knew not;\r\nbut at all events the pleasure of human companionship seemed within his\r\nreach; the presence of the doublet had convinced him that there was\r\nanother man upon the island, and now the mirage showed him the semblance\r\nof a woman!\r\n\r\nVast--colossal--like a dense, dark, shapely cloud, stood that reflected\r\nbeing in the sky; for several minutes it remained thus, and though\r\nWagner could trace no particular outline of features, yet it seemed to\r\nhim as if the female were standing in a pensive attitude. But as the\r\ntwilight gradually subsided, or rather yielded to the increasing\r\nobscurity, the image was absorbed likewise in the growing gloom; until\r\nthe dusky veil of night made the entire vault above of one deep,\r\nuniform, purple hue. Then Wagner once more returned to the cavern, with\r\nthe resolution of crossing the range of hills on the ensuing morn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND QUEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh! how beautiful--how enchantingly beautiful seemed Nisida, as her\r\ndelicate feet bore her glancingly along the sunny banks of the crystal\r\nstream, to the soft music of its waters. How the slight drapery which\r\nshe wore set off the rich undulations of that magnificent form! How the\r\nwreaths and garlands of fantastically woven flowers became the romantic\r\nloveliness of her person--that glowing Hebe of the South!\r\n\r\nHolding in her fair hand a light, slim wand, and moving through the\r\ndelicious vale with all the soft abandonment of gait and limb which\r\nfeared no intrusion on her solitude, she appeared that Mediterranean\r\nisland's queen. What, though the evening breeze, disporting with her\r\nraiment, lifted it from her glowing bosom?--she cared not; no need for\r\nsense of shame was there! What though she laid aside her vesture to\r\ndisport in the sea at morn?--no furtive glances did she cast round; no\r\nhaste did she make to resume her garments; for whose eye, save that of\r\nGod, beheld her?\r\n\r\nBut was she happy? Alas! there were moments when despair seized upon her\r\nsoul; and, throwing herself on the yellow sand, or on some verdant bank,\r\nshe would weep--oh! she would weep such bitter, bitter tears, that those\r\nwho have been forced to contemplate her character with aversion, must\r\nnow be compelled to pity her.\r\n\r\nYes; for there were times when all the loveliness of that island seemed\r\nbut a hideous place of exile, an abhorrent monotony which surrounded\r\nher--grasped her--clung to her--hemmed her in, as if it were an evil\r\nspirit, having life and the power to torture her. She thought of those\r\nwhom she loved, she pondered upon all the grand schemes of her\r\nexistence, and she felt herself cut off from a world to which there were\r\nso many ties to bind her, and in which she had so much to do. Then she\r\nwould give way to all the anguish of her soul--an anguish that amounted\r\nto the deepest, blackest despair, when her glances wildly swept the\r\ncloudless horizon, and beheld not a sail--no! nor a speck on the ocean\r\nto engender hope. But when this tempest of grief and passion was past,\r\nshe would be angry with herself for having yielded to it; and, in order\r\nto distract her thoughts from subjects of gloom, she would bound toward\r\nthe groves, light as a fawn, the dazzling whiteness of her naked and\r\npolished ankles gleaming in contrast with the verdure of the vale.\r\n\r\nOne morning after Nisida had been many, many days on the island, she was\r\nseated on the sand, having just completed her simple toilet on emerging\r\nfrom the mighty bath that lay stretched in glassy stillness far as the\r\neye could reach, when she suddenly sprung upon her feet, and threw\r\naffrighted looks around her. Had she possessed the faculty of hearing,\r\nit would be thought that she was thus startled by the sound of a human\r\nvoice which had at that instant broken upon the solemn stillness of the\r\nisle--a human voice emanating from a short distance behind her. As yet\r\nshe saw no one; but in a few moments a man emerged from the nearest\r\ngrove, and came slowly toward her.\r\n\r\nHe was dressed in a light jerkin, trunk-breeches, tight hose, and\r\nboot--in all as an Italian gentleman of that day, save in respect to hat\r\nand doublet, of which he had none. Neither wore he a sword by his side,\r\nnor carried any weapons of defense; and it was evident he approached the\r\nisland queen with mingled curiosity and awe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he deemed her to be some goddess, endowed with the power and the\r\nwill to punish his intrusion on her realm; or peradventure his\r\nsuperstitious imagination dwelt on the tales which sailors told in those\r\ntimes--how mermaids who fed on human flesh dwelt on the coasts of\r\nuninhabited islands, and assuming the most charming female forms, lured\r\ninto their embrace the victims whom shipwreck cast upon their strand,\r\nand instead of lavishing on them the raptures of love, made them the\r\nprey of their ravenous maws.\r\n\r\nWhatever were his thoughts, the man drew near with evident distrust.\r\nBut, now--why does Nisida's countenance become suddenly crimson with\r\nrage? why rushes she toward the stores which still remained piled up on\r\nthe strand? and wherefore, with the rapidity of the most feverish\r\nimpatience, does she hurl the weapons of defense into the sea, all save\r\none naked sword, with which she arms herself? Because her eagle glance,\r\nquicker than that of the man who is approaching her, has recognized\r\n_him_, ere he has even been struck with a suspicion relative to who\r\n_she_ is--and that man is Stephano Verrina!\r\n\r\nNow, Nisida! summon all thine energies to aid thee; for a strong, a\r\npowerful, a remorseless man, devoured with lust for thee, is near. And\r\nthou art so ravishingly beautiful in thy aerial drapery, and thy wreaths\r\nof flowers, that an anchorite could not view thee with indifference! Ah!\r\nStephano starts--stops short--advances: the suspicion has struck him!\r\nThe aquiline countenance, those brilliant large, dark eyes, that\r\nmatchless raven hair, that splendid symmetrical maturity of form, and\r\nwithal, that close compression of the vermilion lips, O Nisida! have\r\nbeen scanned in rapid detail by the brigand!\r\n\r\n\"Nisida!\" he exclaimed; \"Yes, it is she!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he bounded toward her with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nBut the sharp sword was presented to his chest; and the lady stood with\r\nan air of such resolute determination, that he stopped short gazing upon\r\nher with mingled wonderment and admiration. Heavens! he had never beheld\r\nso glorious a specimen of female loveliness as that whereon his eyes\r\nwere fastened,--fastened beyond the possibility of withdrawal. How\r\nglossy black was that hair with its diadem of white roses! How miserably\r\npoor appeared the hues of the carnations and the pinks that formed her\r\nnecklace, when in contrast with her flushing cheeks! How dingy were the\r\nlilies at her waist, compared with her heaving breast!\r\n\r\nThe reason of the brigand reeled, his brain swam round, and for a moment\r\nit seemed to him that she was not a being of this world; not the Nisida\r\nhe had known and carried off from Italy, but a goddess, another and yet\r\nthe same in all the glory of those matchless charms which had heretofore\r\nravished--no, maddened him!\r\n\r\nAnd now the spirit of this bold and reckless man was subdued--subdued,\r\nhe knew not how nor wherefore; but still subdued by the presence of her\r\nwhom he had deemed lost in the waves, but who seemed to stand before\r\nhim, with flowers upon her brow and a sharp weapon in her hand--radiant,\r\ntoo, with loveliness of person, and terrible with the fires of hatred\r\nand indignation!\r\n\r\nYes! he was subdued--overawed--rendered timid as a young child in her\r\npresence; and sinking upon his knees, he exclaimed--forgetful that he\r\nwas addressing Nisida the deaf and dumb--\"Oh! fear not--I will not harm\r\nthee! But, my God! take compassion on me--spurn me not--look not with\r\nsuch terrible anger upon one who adores, who worships you! How is it\r\nthat I tremble and quail before you--I, once so reckless, so rude. But,\r\noh! to kiss that fair hand--to be your slave--to watch over you--to\r\nprotect you--and all this but for thy smiles in return--I should be\r\nhappy--supremely happy! Remember--we are alone on this island--and I am\r\nthe stronger; I might compel you by force to yield to me--to become\r\nmine; but I will not harm you--no, not a hair of your head, if you will\r\nonly smile upon me! And you will require one to defend and protect\r\nyou--yes, even here in this island, apparently so secure and safe;--for\r\nthere are terrible things in this clime--dreadful beings, far more\r\nformidable than whole hordes of savage men--monsters so appalling that\r\nnot all thy courage, nor all thy energy would avail thee a single moment\r\nagainst them. Yes, lady, believe me when I tell thee this! For\r\nmany--many days have I dwelt, a lonely being, on the other side of this\r\nisle, beyond that chain of mountains--remaining on that shore to which\r\nthe wild waves carried me on the night of shipwreck. But I hurried away\r\nat last--I dared all the dangers of mighty precipices, yawning chasms,\r\nand roaring torrents--the perils of yon mountains--rather than linger on\r\nthe other side. For the anaconda, lady, is the tenant of this\r\nisland--the monstrous snake--the terrible boa, whose dreadful coils, if\r\nwound round that fair form of yours, would crush it into a hideous,\r\nloathsome mass?\"\r\n\r\nStephano had spoken so rapidly, and with such fevered excitement that he\r\nhad no time to reflect whether he were not wasting his words upon a\r\nbeing who could not hear them; until exhausted and breathless with the\r\nvolubility of his utterance he remembered that he was addressing himself\r\nto Nisida the deaf and dumb. But happily his appealing and his suppliant\r\nposture had softened the lady: for toward the end of his long speech a\r\nchange came over her countenance, and she dropped the point of her sword\r\ntoward the ground.\r\n\r\nStephano rose, and stood gazing on her for a few moments with eyes that\r\nseemed to devour her. His mind had suddenly recovered much of its wonted\r\nboldness and audacity. So long as Nisida seemed terrible as well as\r\nbeautiful, he was subdued;--now that her eyes had ceased to dart forth\r\nlightnings, and the expression of her countenance had changed from\r\nindignation and resolute menace to pensiveness and a comparatively\r\nmournful softness, the bandit as rapidly regained the usual tone of his\r\nremorseless mind.\r\n\r\nYes; he stood gazing on her for a few moments, with eyes that seemed to\r\ndevour her:--then, in obedience to the impulse of maddening desire, he\r\nrushed upon her, and in an instant wrenched the sword from her grasp.\r\nBut rapid as lightning, Nisida bounded away from him, ere he could wind\r\nhis arms around her; and fleet as the startled deer, she hastened toward\r\nthe groves.\r\n\r\nStephano, still retaining the sword in his hand, pursued her with a\r\ncelerity which was sustained by his desire to possess her and by his\r\nrage that she had escaped him. But the race was unequal as that of a\r\nlion in chase of a roe; for Nisida seemed borne along as it were upon\r\nthe very air. Leaving the groves on her left she dashed into the vale.\r\nAlong the sunny bank of the limpid stream she sped;--on, on toward a\r\nforest that bounded the valley at the further end, and rose\r\namphitheatrically up toward the regions of the mountains!\r\n\r\nStephano Verrina still pursued her, though losing ground rapidly; but\r\nstill he maintained the chase. And now the verge of the forest is nearly\r\ngained; and in its mazes Nisida hopes to be enabled to conceal herself\r\nfrom the ruffian whom, by a glance hastily cast behind from time to\r\ntime, she ascertains to be upon her track. But, oh! whither art thou\r\nflying thus wildly, beauteous Nisida?--into what appalling perils art\r\nthou rushing, as it were, blindly? For there, in the tallest tree on the\r\nverge of the forest to which thou now art near,--there, amidst the\r\nbending boughs and the quivering foliage--one of the hideous serpents\r\nwhich infest the higher region of the isle is disporting--the terrible\r\nanaconda--the monstrous boa, whose dreadful coils, if wound round that\r\nfair form of thine, would crush it into a loathsome mass!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPTATION--THE ANACONDA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Fernand Wagner was engaged in the attempt to cross the\r\nchain of mountains which intersected the island whereon the shipwreck\r\nhad thrown him. He had clambered over rugged rocks and leapt across many\r\nyawning chasms in that region of desolation,--a region which formed so\r\nremarkable a contrast with the delicious scenery which he had left\r\nbehind him. And now he reached the base of a conical hill, the summit of\r\nwhich seemed to have been split into two parts: and the sinuous tracks\r\nof the lava-streams, now cold, and hard, and black, adown its sides,\r\nconvinced him that this was the volcano, from whose rent crater had\r\npoured the bituminous fluid so fatal to the vegetation of that region.\r\n\r\nFollowing a circuitous and naturally formed pathway round the base, he\r\nreached the opposite side; and now from a height of three hundred feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, his eyes commanded a view of a scene as fair\r\nas that behind the range of mountains. He was now for the first time\r\nconvinced of what he had all along suspected--namely, that it was indeed\r\nan island on which the storm had cast him. But though from the eminence\r\nwhere he stood his view embraced the immense range of the ocean, no\r\nspeck in the horizon--no sail upon the bosom of the expanse imparted\r\nhope to his soul.\r\n\r\nHunger now oppressed him; for he had eaten nothing since the noon of the\r\npreceding day, when he had plucked a few fruits in the groves on the\r\nother side of the island. He accordingly commenced a descent toward the\r\nnew region which lay stretched before him, fair as--even fairer\r\nthan--the one which had first greeted his eyes.\r\n\r\nBut he had not proceeded many yards amidst the defiles of the rugged\r\nrocks which nature had piled around the base of the volcano, when he\r\nfound his way suddenly barred by a vast chasm, on the verge of which the\r\nwinding path stopped.\r\n\r\nThe abyss was far too wide to be crossed save by the wing of the bird:\r\nand in its unfathomable depths boiled and roared a torrent, the din of\r\nwhose eddies was deafening to the ear.\r\n\r\nWagner retraced his way to the very base of the volcano, and entered\r\nanother defile: but this also terminated on the edge of the same\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nAgain and again did he essay the various windings of that scene of rock\r\nand crag: but with no better success than at first; and after passing a\r\nconsiderable time in these fruitless attempts to find a means of descent\r\ninto the plains below, he began to fear that he should be compelled to\r\nretrace his way into the region of verdure which he had quitted the day\r\nbefore, and which lay behind the range of mountains. But the thought of\r\nthe hideous snake which he had seen in the tree caused a cold shudder to\r\npass over him--then, in the next moment, he remembered that if the\r\nregion on one side of the mountain were invested with reptiles of that\r\nterrible species, it was not probable that the forests which he beheld\r\nas it were at his feet, were free from the same source of apprehension.\r\nStill he had hoped to find human companionship on this side of the\r\nmountains which he had so far succeeded in reaching--the companionship\r\nof the man who had cast away the doublet, and of the woman whom he had\r\nseen in the mirage.\r\n\r\nAnd was it not strange that he had not as yet overtaken, or at least\r\nobtained a trace of, the man who thus occupied a portion of his\r\nthoughts? If that man were still amongst the mountains, they would\r\nprobably meet; if he had succeeded in descending into the plains below,\r\nthe same pathway that conducted him thither would also be open to\r\nWagner. Animated with these reflections, and in spite of the hunger\r\nwhich now sorely oppressed him, Wagner prosecuted with fresh courage his\r\nsearch for a means of descent into the lovely regions that lay stretched\r\nbefore him, when he was suddenly startled by the sound of a human voice\r\nnear him.\r\n\r\n\"My son, what dost thou amidst this scene of desolation?\" were the words\r\nwhich, uttered in a mild benignant tone, met his ears.\r\n\r\nHe turned and beheld an old man of venerable appearance, and whose\r\nbeard, white as snow, stretched down to the rude leathern belt which\r\nconfined the palmer's gown that he wore.\r\n\r\n\"Holy anchorite!\" exclaimed Wagner--\"for such must I deem thee to\r\nbe,--the sound of thy voice is most welcome in this solitude, amidst the\r\nmazes of which I vainly seek to find an avenue of egress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus it is oft with the troubles and perplexities of the world, my\r\nson,\" answered the hermit, \"that world which I have quitted forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And dost thou dwell in this desolate region?\" asked Fernand.\r\n\r\n\"My cave is hard by,\" returned the old man. \"For forty years have I\r\nlived in the heart of these mountains, descending only into the plains\r\nat long intervals, to gather the fruits that constitute my food:--and\r\nthen,\" he added, in a tone which, despite the sanctity of his\r\nappearance, struck cold and ominous to the very heart of Wagner,--\"and\r\nthen, too, at the risk of becoming the prey of the terrible anaconda!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou sayest, holy hermit,\" exclaimed Fernand, endeavoring to conquer a\r\nfeeling of unaccountable aversion which he had suddenly entertained\r\ntoward the old man, \"thou sayest that thy cave is hard by. In the name\r\nof mercy! I beseech thee to spare me a few fruits, and a cup of water,\r\nfor I am sinking with fatigue, hunger, and thirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, young man,\" said the hermit; and he led the way to a cave\r\nopening from a narrow fissure in the rock.\r\n\r\nThe anchorite's abode was, as Wagner had expected to find it, rude and\r\ncheerless. A quantity of dry leaves were heaped in one corner--evidently\r\nforming the old man's couch; and in several small hollows made in the\r\nwalls of rock, were heaps of fruit--fresh and inviting, as if they had\r\nonly just been gathered. On the ground stood a large earthen pitcher of\r\nwater. Upon this last object did the thirsty Wagner lay his left hand;\r\nbut ere he raised it, he glanced hastily round the cave in search of a\r\ncrucifix, in the presence of which he might sign the form of the cross\r\nwith his right hand. But to his astonishment the emblem of Christianity\r\nwas not there; and it now struck him for the first time that the\r\nanchorite wore no beads around his waist.\r\n\r\n\"Young man, I can divine your thoughts,\" said the hermit, hastily; \"but\r\ndrink, eat, and ask a blessing presently. Thou art famished, pause not\r\nto question my motives. I will explain them fully to thee when thy body\r\nis refreshed with that pure water and those delicious fruits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Water shall not pass my lips, nor fruits assuage the cravings of\r\nhunger, until I know more of thee, old man!\" exclaimed Wagner, a\r\nterrible suspicion flashing to his mind; and without another instant's\r\nhesitation or delay, he made the sign of the cross.\r\n\r\nA yell of rage and fury burst from the lips of the false anchorite,\r\nwhile his countenance became fearfully distorted--his eyes glared\r\nfiercely--his whole aspect changed--and in a few moments he stood\r\nconfessed in shape, attire and features, the demon who had appeared to\r\nFernand in the prison of Florence!\r\n\r\n\"Fiend! what wouldst thou with me?\" exclaimed Wagner, startled and yet\r\nunsubdued by this appearance of the evil spirit amidst that region of\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n\"Mortal,\" said the demon, in his deepest and most serious tones, \"I am\r\nhere to place happiness--happiness ineffable--within thy reach. Nay, be\r\nnot impatient: but listen to me for a few moments. 'Twas my power that\r\nconducted thy ship, amidst the fury of the storm which _He_ whose name I\r\ndare not mention raised, to the shores of this island. 'Twas my\r\ninfluence which yesterday, as thou wast seated on the sunny banks,\r\nfilled thine imagination with those delicious thoughts of Nisida. And it\r\nwas I also who, by the wonders of the mirage, showed thee the form of\r\nthe only female inhabitant of this isle. And that one female,\r\nWagner--that woman who is now as it were within thy reach--that lovely\r\nbeing whose presence on this island would teach thee to have no regret\r\nfor the world from which you are separated, and whose eyes would cast\r\nforth rays of joy and gladness upon everything around--that charming\r\nlady, who has already decked herself with those flowers which her fair\r\nhands have woven into wildly fantastic arabesques, that being is thy\r\nNisida, the Island Queen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fiend! you mock--you deceive me,\" cried Fernand, wildly hovering\r\nbetween joyous hope and acute fear.\r\n\r\n\"Did I deceive thee, Wagner, when I showed thee thy Nisida in the power\r\nof the corsairs?\" said the demon, with a smile of bitter, sardonic\r\ntriumph. \"I tell thee, then, that Nisida is on this island--there, in\r\nthe very region into which thou wouldst descend, but to which thou wilt\r\nfind no avenue save by my aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida is here--on this island,\" exclaimed Fernand in an ecstasy of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--and Stephano, the bandit, likewise,\" added the demon. \"It was his\r\ndoublet which you found--it was he who slaked his thirst with the juice\r\nof the fruits which I, then invisible, beheld thee contemplate with\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stephano here also!\" cried Wagner. \"Oh! Nisida--to thy rescue!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he bounded forth from the cave, and was rushing madly down one of\r\nthe tortuous defiles leading toward the chasm, when the voice of the\r\ndemon suddenly caused him to stop short.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!--insensate mortal!\" said the fiend, with a derisive laugh. \"How\r\ncanst thou escape from these mountains? But tarry a moment--and behold\r\nthy Nisida--behold also her persecutor, who lusts after her.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking; he handed Wagner a magic telescope, which immediately\r\nbrought the most remote objects to a distance of only a few yards.\r\n\r\nThen what a delicious scene met Fernand's eyes! He beheld Nisida bathing\r\nin the sea--sporting like a mermaid with the wavelets--plunging into the\r\nrefreshing depths--then wringing out the water from her long raven hair,\r\nnow swimming and diving, then wading on her feet,--unconscious that a\r\nhuman eye beheld her.\r\n\r\nAt length she came forth from the sea, beauteous as a Venus rising from\r\nthe ocean; and her toilet commenced upon the sand. But scarcely had she\r\ndecked herself with the flowers which she had gathered early in the\r\nmorning for the purpose, when she started and rose up; and then Wagner\r\nbeheld a man approaching her from the nearest grove.\r\n\r\n\"That is Stephano Verrina!\" murmured the demon in his ears.\r\n\r\nFernand uttered a cry of dismay, and threw down the telescope.\r\n\r\n\"You may save her--save her yet,\" said the demon, speaking in a tone of\r\nunusual haste. \"In a few minutes she will be in his power--he is strong\r\nand desperate; be mine, and consent to serve me--and in a moment Nisida\r\nshall be clasped in thy arms--the arms of thee, her deliverer.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no! I will save her without thine aid, dread fiend!\" exclaimed\r\nWagner, a prey to the most terrible excitement.\r\n\r\nThen making the sign of the cross, he rushed forward to leap the yawning\r\nchasm; his feet touched the opposite side, but he lost his balance,\r\nreeled, and fell back into the tremendous abyss, while the demon, again\r\nbaffled, and shrinking in horror from the emblem of Christianity,\r\ndisappeared with cries of rage and vexation.\r\n\r\nDown--down fell Wagner,--turning over and over in the hideous vacancy,\r\nand clutching vainly at the stunted shrubs and dead roots which\r\nprojected from the rugged sides of the chasm.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was swallowed up by the boiling torrent; but his\r\nsenses did not leave him, and he felt himself hurried along with the\r\nfurious speed of the mad waters. Thus nearly a minute passed; and then\r\nhis headlong course was suddenly arrested by the boughs of a tree,\r\nwhich, having given way at the root, bent over into the torrent. He\r\nclung to the boughs as if they were arms stretched out to rescue him; he\r\nraised himself from amidst the turbid waters--and in a few moments\r\nreached a bank which shelved upward to the edge of a dense forest.\r\n\r\nPrecisely on the opposite or inner side there was an opening in the\r\nrocks, and Wagner's eye could trace upward a steep but still practicable\r\npath, doubtless formed by some torrent of the spring, which was now\r\ndried up amidst the mountains above,--that path reaching to the very\r\nbasis of the volcano.\r\n\r\nThus, had circumstances permitted him to exercise his patience and\r\ninstitute a longer search among the defiles formed by the crags and\r\nrocks around the conical volcano, he would have discovered a means of\r\nsafe egress from that region without daring the desperate leap of the\r\nchasm, desperate even for him, although he bore a charmed life, because\r\nhis limbs might have been broken against the rugged sides of the\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nBetween the opening to the steep path just spoken of, and the shelving\r\nbank on which Wagner now stood, there was so narrow a space, that the\r\nbent tree stretched completely across the torrent; thus any one,\r\ndescending from the mountains by the natural pathway, might cross by\r\nmeans of the tree to the side which Fernand had gained.\r\n\r\n\"This, then, must have been the route by which the villain Stephano\r\nemerged from the mountains,\" he said to himself, \"and the fiend deceived\r\nme when he declared that I could not reach the plains below without his\r\naid.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were his reflections as he hurried up the shelving bank: and when\r\nhe reached the summit his glance embraced a scene already described to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nFor, flying wildly on toward the forest, was his beauteous Nisida,\r\nscattering flowers in her whirlwind progress, those flowers that had ere\r\nnow decked her hair, her neck and her waist.\r\n\r\nAt some distance behind her was the bandit Stephano; with sword in hand\r\nhe still maintained the chase, though breathless and ready to sink from\r\nexhaustion. Not an instant did Wagner tarry upon the top of the bank\r\nwhich he had reached; but darting toward Nisida, who was now scarce\r\nfifty yards from him, he gave vent to an ejaculation of joy.\r\n\r\nShe saw him--she beheld him: and her speed was checked in an instant\r\nwith the overpowering emotion of wonder and delight.\r\n\r\nThen, as he hurried along the verge of the forest to encounter her--to\r\nfold her in his fond embrace--to protect her,--she once more sprung\r\nforward, with outstretched arms, to fly into his arms, which were open\r\nto receive her. But at that instant there was a horrible rustling amidst\r\nthe foliage of the huge tree beneath which she was hastening on;--a\r\nmonstrous snake darted down with a gushing sound, and in another moment\r\nthe beauteous form of Nisida was encircled by its hideous coils.\r\n\r\nThen fled that wondrous self-command which for long years she had\r\nexercised with such amazing success:--then vanished from her mind all\r\nthe strong motives which had induced her to undertake so terrible a\r\nmartyrdom as that of simulating the loss of two faculties most dear and\r\nmost valuable to all human beings;--and with a cry of ineffable anguish,\r\nshe exclaimed, \"_Fernand, save me! save me!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nNISIDA AND WAGNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh! with what astonishment and joy would Wagner have welcomed the sound\r\nof that voice, so long hushed, and now so musical even in its rending\r\nagony,--had not such an appalling incident broken the spell that for\r\nyears had sealed the lips of his beloved! But he had no time for\r\nthought--there was not a moment for reflection. Nisida lay senseless on\r\nthe ground, with the monster coiled around her--its long body hanging\r\ndown from the bough to which it was suspended by the tail.\r\nSimultaneously with the cry of anguish that had come from the lips of\r\nNisida, exclamations of horror burst alike from Wagner and Stephano.\r\n\r\nThe latter stood transfixed as it were for a few moments, his eyes\r\nglaring wildly on the dreadful spectacle before him; then, yielding to\r\nthe invincible terror that had seized upon him, he hurled away the\r\nsword--knowing not what he did in the excitement of his mind, and fled!\r\nBut the gleaming of the naked weapon in the sunbeams met Wagner's eyes\r\nas it fell, and darting toward it, he grasped it with a firm\r\nhand--resolving also to use it with a stout heart. Then he advanced\r\ntoward the snake, which was comparatively quiescent--that portion of its\r\nlong body which hung between the tree and the first coil that it made\r\nround the beauteous form of Nisida alone moving; and this motion was a\r\nwaving kind of oscillation, like that of a bell-rope which a person\r\nholds by the end and swings gently.\r\n\r\nBut from the midst of the coils the hideous head of the monster stood\r\nout--its eyes gleaming malignantly upon Wagner as he approached.\r\nSuddenly the reptile, doubtless alarmed by the flashing of the bright\r\nsword, disengaged itself like lightning from the awful embrace in which\r\nit had retained the Lady Nisida, and sprung furiously toward Fernand.\r\nBut the blow that he aimed at its head was unerring and heavy; its skull\r\nwas cloven in two--and it fell on the long grass, where it writhed in\r\nhorrible convulsions for some moments, although its life was gone.\r\n\r\nWords cannot be found to describe the delirium of joy which Wagner felt,\r\nwhen having thus slain the terrible anaconda, he placed his hand on\r\nNisida's heart and felt that it beat--though languidly. He lifted her\r\nfrom the ground--he carried her in his arms to the bank of the limpid\r\nstream--and he sprinkled water upon her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\nSlowly did she recover; and when her large black eyes at length opened,\r\nshe uttered a fearful shriek, and closed them again--for with returning\r\nlife the reminiscence of the awful embrace of the serpent came back\r\nalso. But Wagner murmured words of sweet assurance and consolation--of\r\nlove and joy, in her ears; and she felt that it was no dream, but that\r\nshe was really saved! Then, winding her arms round Fernand's neck, she\r\nembraced him in speechless and still almost senseless trance, for the\r\nidea of such happy deliverance was overpowering--amounting to an agony\r\nwhich a mortal creature could scarcely endure.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Nisida,\" at length exclaimed Wagner, \"was it a delusion produced by\r\nthe horrors of that scene?--or did thy voice really greet mine ears ere\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a minute's profound silence--during which, as they sat upon\r\nthe bank of the stream, locked in a fond embrace, their eyes were fixed\r\nwith fascinating gaze upon each other, as if they could not contemplate\r\neach other too long--he in tenderness, and she in passion.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Fernand,\" said Nisida, breaking that deep silence at last, and\r\nspeaking in a voice so mellifluously clear, so soft, so penetrating in\r\nits tone, that it realized all the fond ideas which her lover had\r\nconceived of what its nature would be if it were ever restored, \"yes,\r\nFernand, dearest Fernand,\" she repeated, \"you did indeed hear my voice,\r\nand to _you_ never again shall I be mute.\"\r\n\r\nWagner could not allow her time to say more: he was almost wild with\r\nrapture! His Nisida was restored to him, and no longer Nisida the deaf\r\nand dumb, but Nisida who could hear the fond language which he addressed\r\nto her, and who could respond in the sweetest, most melting and\r\ndelicious tones that ever came from woman's lips.\r\n\r\nFor a long time their hearts were too full, alike for total silence or\r\nconnected conversation, and while the world from which they were cut off\r\nwas entirely forgotten, they gathered so much happiness from the few\r\nwords in which they indulged, and from all that they read in each\r\nother's eyes, that the emotions which they experienced might have\r\nfurnished sensations for a lifetime.\r\n\r\nAt length--she scarcely knew how the subject began, although it might\r\nnaturally have arisen of its own spontaneous suggestion--Nisida found\r\nherself speaking of the long period of deception which she had\r\nmaintained in relation to her powers of speech and hearing.\r\n\r\n\"Thou lovest me well, dearest Fernand,\" she said in her musical Italian\r\ntones; \"and thou would'st not create a pang in my heart? Then never seek\r\nto learn wherefore, when at the still tender age of fifteen, I resolved\r\nupon consummating so dreadful a sacrifice as to affect dumbness. The\r\ncircumstances were, indeed, solemnly grave and strangely important,\r\nwhich demanded so awful a martyrdom. But well did I weigh all the misery\r\nand all the peril that such a self-devotion was sure to entail upon me.\r\nI knew that I must exercise the most stern--the most remorseless--the\r\nmost inflexible despotism over my emotions--that I must crush as it were\r\nthe very feelings of my soul--that I must also observe a caution so\r\nunwearied and so constantly wakeful, that it would amount to a\r\nsensitiveness the most painful--and that I must prepare myself to hear\r\nthe merry jest without daring to smile, or the exciting narrative of the\r\nworld's stirring events without suffering my countenance to vary a hue!\r\nOh! I calculated--I weighed all this, and yet I was not appalled by the\r\nimmensity of the task. I knew the powers of my own mind, and I did not\r\ndeceive myself as to their extent. But, ah! how fearful was it at first\r\nto hear the sounds of human voices, and dare not respond to them; how\r\nmaddening at times was it to listen to conversation in which I longed to\r\njoin, and yet be compelled to sit like a passionless statue! But mine\r\nwas a will of iron strength--a resolution of indomitable power! Even\r\nwhen alone when I knew that I should not be overheard--I never essayed\r\nthe powers of my voice, I never murmured a single syllable to myself so\r\nfearful was I lest the slightest use of the glorious gift of speech\r\nmight render me weak in my purpose. And strange as it may seem to you,\r\ndearest Fernand, not even on this island did I yield to the temptation\r\nof suddenly breaking that long, that awful silence which I had imposed\r\nupon myself. And, until this day, one human being only, save myself, was\r\nacquainted with that mighty secret of ten long years, and that man was\r\nthe generous-hearted, the noble-minded Dr. Duras. He it was who aided me\r\nin my project of simulating the forlorn condition of the deaf and dumb:\r\nhe it was who bribed the turnkeys to admit me unquestioned to your cell\r\nin the prison of the ducal palace. And for years, perhaps, should I have\r\nretained my wondrous secret even from _you_, dearest Fernand; for\r\nthrough dangers of many kinds--in circumstances of the most trying\r\nnature, have I continued firm in my purpose; abjuring the faculty of\r\nspeech even when it would have saved me from much cruel embarrassment or\r\nfrom actual peril. Thus, when the villain Stephano Verrina bore me away\r\nby force from my native city, I maintained the seal upon my lips,\r\ntrusting to circumstances to enable me to escape from his power without\r\nbeing compelled to betray a secret of such infinite value and importance\r\nto myself. But when I found that I was so narrowly watched at Leghorn\r\nthat flight was impossible, I seriously debated, in my own mind, the\r\nnecessity of raising an alarm in the house where I was kept a prisoner\r\nfor two whole days; and then I reflected that I was in the power of a\r\ndesperate bandit and his two devoted adherents, who were capable of any\r\natrocity to forward their designs or prevent exposure. Lastly, when I\r\nwas conveyed at dead of night on board the corsair-ship, the streets\r\nwere deserted, and the pirates with whom Stephano was leagued, thronged\r\nthe port. I therefore resigned myself to my fate, trusting still to\r\ncircumstances, and retaining my secret. But that incident of to-day--oh!\r\nit was enough to crush energies ten thousand times more powerful than\r\nmine: it was of so horrifying a nature as to be sufficient to loose the\r\nbands which confine the tongue of one really dumb.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a strong shudder convulsed the entire form of Nisida, as she thus,\r\nby her own words, recalled so forcibly to mind that terrible event which\r\nhad broken a spell of ten years' duration.\r\n\r\nFernand pressed her to his bosom, exclaiming, \"Oh, beloved Nisida, how\r\nbeautiful dost thou appear to me!--how soft and charming is that dear\r\nvoice of thine! Let us not think of the past, at least not now; for I\r\nalso have explanations to give thee,\" he added, slowly and mournfully;\r\nthen, in a different and again joyous tone, he said: \"Let us be happy in\r\nthe conviction that we are restored to each other; let this be a\r\nholiday--nay, more,\" he added, sinking his voice almost to a whisper;\r\n\"let it be the day on which we join our hands together in the sight of\r\nHeaven. No priest will bless our union, Nisida; but we will plight our\r\nvows--and God will accord us his blessing.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady hid her blushing, glowing countenance on his breast, and\r\nmurmured in a voice melodious as the music of the stream by which they\r\nsat, \"Fernand, I am thine--thine forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I am thine, my beauteous Nisida; thine forever, as thou art mine!\"\r\nexclaimed Wagner, lifting her head and gazing on her lovely, blushing\r\nface as on a vision of heaven.\r\n\r\n\"No; she is mine!\" thundered the voice of the forgotten Stephano, and in\r\na moment the bandit flung himself upon Wagner, whom he attempted to hurl\r\ninto the crystal but deep river.\r\n\r\nFernand, however, caught the arm of the brigand and dragged him along\r\nwith him into the water, while a terrific scream burst from the lips of\r\nNisida. Then furious was the struggle that commenced in the depths of\r\nthe stream. But Stephano lay beneath Wagner, who held him down on the\r\npebbly bottom. In another moment Nisida herself plunged into the river\r\nwith the wild hope of aiding her lover to conquer his foe, or to rescue\r\nhim from the grasp which the bandit maintained upon him with the\r\ntenacity that was strengthened rather than impaired by the agony of\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\nBut she rose again to the surface in an instant by the indomitable\r\ninfluence of that instinct for self-preservation which no human being,\r\nwhen immersed in the deep water, can resist if the art of swimming has\r\nbeen attained. Again she dived to succor her lover, but her aid, even if\r\nshe could have afforded any, was no longer necessary, for Fernand rose\r\nfrom the crystal depths and bore his Nisida to the bank, while the\r\ncorpse of the drowned bandit was carried away by the current.\r\n\r\nWagner and Nisida were now the sole human inhabitants of that isle--the\r\nking and queen of the loveliest clime on which the sun shone. Toward the\r\nsea-shore they repaired, hand in hand, and having partaken of the fruits\r\nwhich they gathered in their way, they set to work to form a hut with\r\nthe planks, cordage, and canvas of the wreck. It will be remembered that\r\nNisida had saved the carpenter's tools, and thus the task became a\r\ncomparatively easy one.\r\n\r\nBy the time the sun went down a tenement was formed, rude, it is true,\r\nbut still perfect enough to harbor them in a clime where the nights were\r\nwarm and where the dews prevailed only in the verdant parts of the isle.\r\nThen with what joyous feelings did Nisida deck the walls of the hut with\r\na tapestry of flowers and prepare the bridal couch with materials which\r\nshe had saved from the wreck.\r\n\r\nSoftly and sweetly shone the moon that night; and, as its silver rays\r\npenetrated through the crevices of the little cottage so hastily and so\r\nrudely formed, they played kissingly upon the countenances of the happy\r\npair who had wedded each other in the sight of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nALESSANDRO FRANCATELLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader should fully understand the stirring incidents\r\nwhich yet remain to be told, it is necessary for us to explain certain\r\nparticulars connected with Alessandro Francatelli, the brother of the\r\nbeautiful Flora. It will be recollected that this young man accompanied\r\nthe Florentine envoy to Constantinople, in the honorable capacity of\r\nsecretary, some few years previous to the commencement of our tale.\r\n\r\nAlessandro was strikingly handsome, tall, well-formed, and of great\r\nphysical strength. His manners were pleasing, his conversation agreeable\r\nto a degree. Indeed, he had profited so well by the lessons of the\r\nexcellent-hearted Father Marco, that his mind was well stored with\r\nintellectual wealth. He was, moreover, a finished musician, and played\r\nthe violin, at that period a rare accomplishment, to perfection. In\r\naddition to all these qualifications, he was a skillful versifier, and\r\ncomposed the most beautiful extemporaneous poetry, apparently without an\r\neffort. But his disposition was by no means light or devoted to pursuits\r\nwhich worldly-minded persons would consider frivolous. For he himself\r\nwas worldly-minded, keen, shrewd, far-seeing, and ambitious. He deplored\r\nthe ruin which had overtaken his family, and longed ardently to rebuild\r\nits fortunes, adding thereto the laurels of glory and the honors of\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nThe situation which he enjoyed in the establishment of the Florentine\r\nenvoy appeared to him the stepping-stone to the attainment of these\r\nobjects, but the embassy had not been long settled at Constantinople,\r\nwhen Alessandro found that his master was one who, being ignorant\r\nhimself, was jealous of the talents displayed by others. Great interest\r\nhad alone procured the envoy the post which he held as negotiator\r\nplenipotentiary with the Ottoman Porte, on behalf of the Republic of\r\nFlorence; and the Turkish reis-effendi, or minister of foreign affairs,\r\nsoon perceived that the Christian embassador was quite incompetent to\r\nenter into the intricacies of treaties and the complex machinery of\r\ndiplomacy. But suddenly the official notes which the envoy addressed to\r\nthe reis-effendi began to exhibit a sagacity and an evidence of\r\nfar-sighted policy which contrasted strongly with the imbecility which\r\nhad previously characterized those communications. It was at that period\r\na part of the policy of the Ottoman Port to maintain spies in the\r\nhousehold of all the foreign embassadors residing in Constantinople; and\r\nthrough this agency the reis-effendi discovered that the Florentine\r\nenvoy had condescended to avail himself of the brilliant talents of his\r\nsecretary, Alessandro Francatelli, to infuse spirit into his official\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe reis-effendi was himself a shrewd and sagacious man; and he\r\nrecognized in the abilities evinced by the youthful secretary, those\r\nelements which, if properly developed, would form a great politician.\r\nThe Turkish Minister accordingly resolved to leave no stone unturned, in\r\norder to entice so promising an individual into the service of the\r\nsultan. To accomplish this object indirect means were at first\r\nattempted; and the secret agents of the minister sounded Alessandro upon\r\nthe subject. He listened to them at first in silence, but not\r\nunwillingly. They grew bolder, and their speech became more open. He\r\nencouraged them to lay bare their aims; and they hinted to him how\r\nglorious a career might be opened to him were he to enter the service of\r\nthe high and mighty sultan, Solyman the Magnificent, who then sat upon\r\nthe proud throne of the Ottoman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe more attentively Alessandro listened, the less reserved became those\r\nwho were instructed to undermine his fidelity toward his master, the\r\nFlorentine Envoy. They represented to him how Christians, who had\r\nabjured their creed and embraced the Moslem faith, had risen to the\r\nhighest offices, even to the post of grand vizier, or prime minister of\r\nthe empire. Alessandro was completely master of his emotions; he had not\r\nstudied for some years in the school of diplomacy without learning how\r\nto render the expression of his countenance such as at any moment to\r\nbelie the real state of his feelings. He did not, therefore, suffer the\r\nspies and agents of the reis-effendi to perceive how deep an impression\r\ntheir words had made upon him; but he said and looked enough to convince\r\nthem that the topics of their discourse would receive the most serious\r\nconsideration at his hands. His mind was already made up to accept the\r\novertures thus made to him; but he affected to hesitate, for he saw that\r\nhis services were ardently longed for, and he resolved to drive as\r\nadvantageous a bargain as possible.\r\n\r\nHe was one afternoon lounging through the principal bezestein or bazaar,\r\nwhen he was struck by the elegant form, imposing air, and rich apparel\r\nof a lady who rode slowly along upon a mule, attended by four female\r\nslaves on foot. The outlines of her figure shaped the most admirable\r\nsymmetry he had ever beheld; and though her countenance was concealed by\r\na thick veil, in accordance with the custom of the East, yet he seemed\r\nto have been impressed with an instinctive conviction that the face\r\nbeneath that invidious covering was eminently beautiful. Moreover, the\r\neyes whose glances flashed through the two holes which were formed in\r\nthe veil so as to permit the enjoyment of the faculty of sight, were\r\ngloriously brilliant, yet black as jet. Once, too, when the lady raised\r\nher delicate white hand, sparkling with jewels, to arrange the folds of\r\nthat hated veil, Alessandro caught a rapid, evanescent glimpse of a neck\r\nas white as snow.\r\n\r\nThe little procession stopped at the door of a merchant's shop in the\r\nbazaar; the slaves assisted the lady to dismount, and she entered the\r\nwarehouse, followed by her dependents, the mule being left in charge of\r\none of the numerous porters who thronged in the bezestein.\r\n\r\nAlessandro lingered near the door, and he beheld the merchant displaying\r\nvarious pieces of rich brocade before the eyes of the lady, who,\r\nhowever, scrupulously retained the dense veil over her countenance.\r\nHaving made her purchases, which were taken charge of by one of the\r\nslaves, the lady came forth again; and Alessandro, forgetting that his\r\nlingering near now amounted to almost an act of rudeness, was chained to\r\nthe spot, lost in admiration of her elegant gesture, her graceful yet\r\ndignified carriage, and the exquisite contour of her perfect shape. Her\r\nfeet and ankles, appearing beneath the full trousers, that were gathered\r\nin just at the commencement of the swell of the leg, were small and\r\nbeautifully shaped; and so light was her tread, that she scarcely seemed\r\nto touch the ground on which she walked.\r\n\r\nAs the lady issued from the door of the merchant's shop, she cast a\r\nrapid but inquiring look toward Alessandro, though whether in anger or\r\ncuriosity he was unable to determine, for the eyes only could he see,\r\nand it was impossible for him to read the meaning of the glances they\r\nsent forth, when unassisted by a view of the general expression worn by\r\nher countenance at the same time.\r\n\r\nAccident, however, favored him far more than he could have possibly\r\nanticipated. At the very moment when the lady's head was turned toward\r\nhim, she tripped over the cordage of a bale of goods that had shortly\r\nbefore been opened beneath the painted awning over the front of the\r\nshop, and she would have fallen had not Alessandro sprung forward and\r\ncaught her in his arms.\r\n\r\nShe uttered a faint scream, for her veil had shifted aside from its\r\nproper position; and her countenance was thus revealed to a man, and\r\nthat man evidently by his dress a Christian!\r\n\r\nInstantly recovering her self-possession, she readjusted her veil, gave\r\na gentle but graceful inclination of the head toward Alessandro, mounted\r\nher mule by the assistance of the slaves, and rode away at a somewhat\r\nhasty pace. Alessandro stood gazing after her until she turned the angle\r\nof the nearest street, and it struck him that her glance was for an\r\ninstant cast rapidly back toward him, ere she disappeared from his view.\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder that he stood thus rooted to the spot, following her with\r\nhis eyes; for the countenance which accident had revealed to him was\r\nalready impressed upon his heart. It was one of those lovely Georgian\r\nfaces, oval in shape, and with a complexion formed of milk and roses,\r\nwhich have at all times been prized in the East, as the very perfection\r\nof female beauty; a face which, without intellectual expression,\r\npossesses an ineffable witchery, and all the charms calculated to\r\nfascinate the beholder. The eyes were black as jet, the hair of a dark\r\nauburn, and luxuriantly rich in its massive beauty; the lips were of\r\nbright vermilion, and between them were two rows of pearl, small and\r\neven. The forehead was high and broad, and white as marble, with the\r\ndelicate blue veins visible through the transparent complexion.\r\n\r\nAlessandro was ravished as he reflected on the wondrous beauty thus for\r\na moment revealed to him, but his raptures speedily changed to positive\r\ngrief when he thought how improbable it was that this fair creature\r\nwould ever cross his path again. He entered the warehouse, made a small\r\npurchase, and inquired casually of the Turkish merchant if he knew who\r\nthe lady was. The reply was in the negative, but the merchant informed\r\nAlessandro that he had no doubt the lady was of some rank, from the\r\nprofound respect with which her slaves treated her, and from the\r\nreadiness with which she paid the prices demanded of her for the goods\r\nshe had purchased, Turkish ladies generally being notorious for their\r\ndisposition to drive a hard bargain with traders.\r\n\r\nAlessandro returned to the suburb of Pera, in which the mansion of the\r\nFlorentine Embassy was situated--his mind full of the beautiful creature\r\nwhose countenance he had seen for a moment, and whose soft form he had\r\nalso for a moment--a single moment--held in his arms. He could not apply\r\nhimself to the duties of his office, but feigned indisposition and\r\nretired to the privacy of his own apartment. And never did that chamber\r\nseem so lonely, so cold, so cheerless. His entire disposition appeared\r\nto have become suddenly changed; he felt that the world now contained\r\nsomething the possession of which was positively necessary to his\r\nhappiness. One sole idea absorbed all his thoughts: the most lovely\r\ncountenance which, in his estimation, he had ever seen was so indelibly\r\nreflected in the mirror of his mind, that his imagination could\r\ncontemplate naught besides. He knew not that whenever he went abroad, he\r\nwas watched by one of the spies of the reis-effendi; and he was\r\ntherefore surprised when, on the following day, that secret agent of the\r\nminister whispered in his ear, \"Christian, thou lovest--and it depends\r\non thyself whether thou wilt be loved in return!\"\r\n\r\nAlessandro was stupefied at these words. His secret was known, or at\r\nleast suspected. He questioned the individual who had thus addressed\r\nhim, and he found that the incident of the preceding day was indeed more\r\nthan suspected--it _was_ known. He besought to know who the lady was;\r\nbut the spy would not, or could not satisfy him. He, however, promised\r\nthat he would endeavor to ascertain a point in which Alessandro appeared\r\nto be so deeply interested. The intriguing spirit of Turkish dependents\r\nis notorious: the reader will not therefore be surprised when we state\r\nthat in a few days the spy made his appearance in Alessandro's presence\r\nwith a countenance denoting joyous tidings. The young Italian was\r\nimpatient to learn the results of the agent's inquiries.\r\n\r\n\"I know not who the lady is,\" was the reply; \"but this much I have to\r\nimpart to you, signor--that she did not behold you the other day with\r\nindifference; that she is grateful for the attention you paid in\r\noffering your aid to save her from perhaps a serious accident--and that\r\nshe will grant you a few moments' interview this evening, provided you\r\nassent to certain conditions to be imposed upon you, respecting the\r\npreliminary arrangements for your meeting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Name them! name them!\" exclaimed Alessandro, wild with joy, and almost\r\ndoubting whether he were not in the midst of a delicious dream.\r\n\r\n\"That you consent to be blindfolded while being conducted into her\r\npresence--that you maintain the most profound silence while with those\r\nwho will guide you to her abode--and that you return from the interview\r\nunder the same circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be unworthy the interest which she deigns to manifest in my\r\nbehalf, were I to refuse compliance with those terms,\" answered\r\nAlessandro.\r\n\r\n\"An hour after sunset,\" said the spy, \"you will meet me at the gate of\r\nthe Mosque of Selimya;\" and with those words he hurried away, leaving\r\nthe young Florentine in a state of excited hope, amounting to a delirium\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\nAlessandro was well aware that adventures, such as the one in which he\r\nfound himself suddenly involved, were by no means uncommon in the East;\r\nand that ladies of the most unimpeachable virtue, as well as of the\r\nhighest rank, frequently accorded interviews of this private nature to\r\nthose men who were fortunate enough to merit their attention--such\r\nvisits being the first step toward matrimonial connections. But then he\r\nremembered that he was a Christian, and the fair object of his devotion\r\nwas probably of the Moslem faith. What, then, would be the result? Was\r\nsome wealthy lady of high rank about to abandon her creed for his sake?\r\nor would the sacrifice of his faith be required as the only condition on\r\nwhich his complete happiness might be achieved? He knew not--cared but\r\nlittle; it was sufficient for him that he was to meet the charming being\r\nwhose image had never once quitted his mind, from the first moment he\r\nhad seen her in the bezestein!\r\n\r\nEven before the appointed hour was Alessandro pacing the square in front\r\nof the splendid temple which the Sultan Selim--the conqueror of\r\nEgypt--had erected, and which bore his imperial name. At length the\r\nagent, for whom he waited, made his appearance. This man, though\r\nactually a Turkish dependent in the service of the Florentine Envoy,\r\nwas, as before stated, neither more nor less than one of the numerous\r\nspies placed by the reis-effendi round the person of that embassador.\r\nAlessandro was aware of this, in consequence of the offers and\r\nrepresentations that had been made to him through the means of this\r\nagent, and though the youth suspected that the man knew more concerning\r\nthe beauteous idol of his heart than he had chosen to admit, yet he had\r\nseen enough to convince him of the inutility of questioning him on that\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, in silence that Alessandro followed his guide through\r\nseveral by-streets down to the margin of the waters of the Golden Horn.\r\nThere a boat, in which two rowers and a female slave were seated, was\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\"Here, must you be blindfolded,\" said the spy.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Alessandro hesitated, in regret that he had gone so\r\nfar with this adventure. He had heard fearful tales of dark deeds\r\ncommitted on the waters of the Bosporus and the Golden Horn; and he\r\nhimself, when roving during his leisure hours along the verdant banks of\r\nthose waters, had seen the livid corpse float with the tale-telling\r\nbow-string fastened round the neck.\r\n\r\nThe spy seemed to divine his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"You hesitate, signor,\" he said; \"then let us retrace our way. But\r\nremember,\" he added in a low tone, \"that were treachery intended, it\r\nwould be as easy to perform the deed where you now stand, as on the\r\nbosom of that star-lit gulf.\"\r\n\r\nAlessandro hesitated no longer, but suffered himself to be completely\r\nhooded in a cap which the spy drew over his countenance. He was then\r\nconducted into the boat and guided to a seat next to the female slave.\r\nThe spy leapt upon the strand, the boatmen plied their oars, and the\r\nskiff shot away from the bank, no one uttering a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[END OF PART I.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART II._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE LADY OF CONSTANTINOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor upward of half an hour did the boat skim the surface of the Golden\r\nHorn, the dip of the oars in the water and the rippling around the sharp\r\nprow alone breaking the solemn silence of the night. At length the skiff\r\nstopped, and the female slave took Alessandro's hand, whispering in a\r\nlow tone, \"I will serve as thy guide, Christian; but speak not till thou\r\nhast permission.\"\r\n\r\nShe then led him from the boat, up a flight of steps, and through a\r\ngarden--for he occasionally came in contact with the outstretching\r\nbranches of shrubs, and there was moreover a delicious odor of flowers,\r\nas he proceeded in the total darkness of his blindfolding. At the\r\nexpiration of ten minutes the guide stopped; and Alessandro heard a key\r\nturn in a lock.\r\n\r\n\"Enter there,\" said the slave, pushing him gently forward, and speaking\r\nin a low tone. \"Take off the cap--attire yourself in the raiment you\r\nwill find ready provided, and then pass fearlessly through the door at\r\nthe further end of the room. You will meet me again in the hall which\r\nyou will thus reach.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, without waiting for a reply, the slave closed and locked the door\r\nthrough which Alessandro had just passed. Hastily did he remove the cap,\r\nwhich had indeed almost suffocated him; and he now found himself in a\r\nsmall apartment, elegantly furnished in the most luxurious Oriental\r\nfashion, and brilliantly lighted. A table spread with confectionery,\r\ncakes, fruits, and even wines--though the fermented juice of the grape\r\nbe expressly forbidden by the laws of the Prophet Mohammed--occupied the\r\ncenter of the room. Around the walls were continuous sofas, or ottomans,\r\nso conducive to the enjoyment of a voluptuous indolence; the floor was\r\nspread with a carpet so thick that the feet sunk into the silky texture,\r\nas into newly fallen snow; and whichever way he turned Alessandro beheld\r\nhis form reflected in vast mirrors set in magnificent frames. There were\r\nno windows on any side of this apartment; but there was a cupola fitted\r\nwith stained glass on the roof, and Alessandro judged that he was in one\r\nof those voluptuous kiosks usually found in the gardens of wealthy\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\nPrecisely as the slave had informed him, he found an elegant suit of\r\nMoslem garments set out on the sofa for his use; and he hastened to\r\nexchange his Italian costume for the Oriental raiment. As he thus\r\nattired himself, it was necessary to contemplate himself in the mirror\r\nfacing him, so as properly to adjust clothes to which he was totally\r\nunaccustomed; and it struck him that the garb of the infidel became him\r\nbetter than that of the Christian. He did not, however, waste time in\r\nthe details of this strange toilet; but as soon as it was completed he\r\nopened the door at the further end of the room, in pursuance of the\r\ninstructions he had received. Alessandro found himself in a large marble\r\nhall, from which several flights of stairs led to the apartments above.\r\nThe place was refulgent with the light of numerous chandeliers, the\r\nglare of which was enhanced by the vast mirrors attached to the walls,\r\nand the crystal pillars that supported the roof.\r\n\r\nNot a human being met Alessandro's eyes; and he began to fear either\r\nthat he had mistaken the directions he had received, or that some\r\ntreachery was intended, when a door opened, and the female slave,\r\nwrapped in a veil, made her appearance. Placing her forefinger upon that\r\npart of the veil which covered her lips, to enjoin silence, she led the\r\nway up the nearest staircase, Alessandro following with a heart beating\r\naudibly. They reached a door at which a negro male slave was stationed.\r\n\r\n\"The hakim\" (physician), said Alessandro's guide, laconically addressing\r\nherself to the negro, who bowed in silence and threw open the door. The\r\nfemale slave conducted the pretended physician into a small but\r\nsplendidly furnished ante-room, in which there were several other\r\ndependents of her own sex. A door at the further end was opened, and\r\nAlessandro passed through into another, larger, and still more\r\nmagnificently furnished room; the door closed behind him, and he found\r\nhimself alone with the idol of his adoration.\r\n\r\nHalf seated, half lying upon cushions of scarlet brocade, the glossy\r\nbright hue of which was mellowed by the muslin spread over it, appeared\r\nthe beauteous creature whose image was so faithfully delineated in his\r\nmemory. She was attired in the graceful and becoming dualma, a purple\r\nvest which set close to her form, and with a species of elasticity\r\nshaped itself so as to develop every contour.\r\n\r\nBut in accordance with the custom of the clime and age, the dualma was\r\nopen at the bosom, sloping from each lovely white shoulder to the waist,\r\nwhere the two folds joining, formed an angle, at which the purple vest\r\nwas fastened by a diamond worth a monarch's ransom. The sleeves were\r\nwide, but short, scarcely reaching to the elbow, and leaving all the\r\nlower part of the snowy arms completely bare. Her ample trousers were of\r\npurple silk, covered with the finest muslin, and drawn in tight a little\r\nabove the ankles, which were naked. On her feet she wore crimson\r\nslippers cut very low, and each ornamented with a diamond. Round her\r\nperson below the waist she wore a magnificent shawl, rolled up, as it\r\nwere, negligently, so as to form a girdle or zone, and fastened in front\r\nwith two large tassels of pearls. Diamond bracelets adorned her fair\r\narms; and her head-dress consisted of a turban or shawl of light but\r\nrich material, fastened with golden bodkins, the head of each being a\r\npearl of the best water. Beneath this turban, her rich auburn hair,\r\nglowing like gold in the light of the perfumed lamps, and amidst the\r\nblaze of diamonds which adorned her, was parted in massive bands,\r\nsweeping gracefully over her temples and gathered behind the ears, then\r\nfalling in all the luxuriance of its rich clustering folds over the\r\ncushion whereon she reclined. Her finger-nails were slightly tinged with\r\nhenna, the rosy hue the more effectually setting off the lily whiteness\r\nof her delicate hand and full round arm. But no need had she to dye the\r\nlashes of her eyes with the famous kohol, so much used by Oriental\r\nladies, for those lashes were by nature formed of the deepest jet--a\r\nsomewhat unusual but beauteous contrast with the color of her hair. The\r\ncheeks of the lovely creature were slightly flushed, or it might have\r\nbeen a reflection of the scarlet brocade of the cushion on which, as we\r\nhave said, she was half-seated, half-lying, when Alessandro appeared in\r\nher presence.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the young Italian was so dazzled by her beauty, so\r\nbewildered by the appearance of that lady, whose richness of attire\r\nseemed to denote the rank of sultana, that he remained rooted to the\r\nspot, uncertain whether to advance, to retire, or to fall upon his knees\r\nbefore her. But in an encouraging tone, and in a voice musical as a\r\nsilver bell, the lady said: \"Approach, Christian!\" and she pointed to a\r\nlow ottoman within a few paces of the sofa which she herself occupied.\r\nAlessandro now recovered his presence of mind; and no longer embarrassed\r\nand awkward, but with graceful ease and yet profound respect, he took\r\nthe seat indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Beauteous lady,\" he said, \"how can I ever demonstrate the\r\ngratitude--the illimitable, boundless gratitude which fills my heart,\r\nfor the joy, the truly elysian delight afforded me by this meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak our language well, Christian,\" observed the lady, smiling\r\nfaintly at the compliment conveyed by the words of Alessandro, but\r\nevading a direct reply.\r\n\r\n\"I have for some years past been in the service of the Florentine envoy,\r\nlady,\" was the answer; \"and the position which I occupy at the palace of\r\nthe embassy has led me to study the beauteous language of this clime,\r\nand to master its difficulties. But never, never did that language sound\r\nso soft and musical upon my ears as now, flowing from those sweet lips\r\nof thine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Moslem maiden dares not listen to the flattery of the infidel,\"\r\nsaid the beauteous stranger in a serious but not severe tone. \"Listen to\r\nme, Christian, with attention, for our meeting must not be prolonged\r\nmany minutes. To say that I beheld thee with indifference when we first\r\nencountered each other in the bazaar, were to utter a falsehood which I\r\nscorn; to admit that I can love thee, and love thee well,\" she added,\r\nher voice slightly trembling, \"is an avowal which I do not blush to\r\nmake. But never can the Moslem maiden bestow her hand on the infidel. If\r\nthou lovest me--if thou wouldst prove thyself worthy of that affection\r\nwhich my heart is inclined to bestow upon thee, thou wilt renounce the\r\ncreed of thy forefathers, and embrace the Mussulman faith. Nor is this\r\nall that I require of thee, or that thou must achieve to win me. Become\r\na true believer--acknowledge that Allah is God and Mohammed is his\r\nprophet--and a bright and glorious destiny will await thee. For although\r\nthou wilt depart hence without learning my name, or who I may be, or the\r\nplace to which you have been brought to meet me,--though we shall behold\r\neach other no more until thou hast rendered thyself worthy of my hand,\r\nyet shall I ever be mindful of thee, my loved one! An unseen, an unknown\r\ninfluence shall attend thee: thy slightest wishes will be anticipated\r\nand fulfilled in a manner for which thou wilt vainly seek to\r\naccount,--and, as thou provest thy talents or thy valor, so will\r\npromotion open its doors to thee with such rapidity that thou wilt\r\nstrain every nerve to reach the highest offices in the state--for then\r\nonly may'st thou hope to receive my hand, and behold the elucidation of\r\nthe mystery which up to that date will envelop thy destinies.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the lady was thus speaking, a fearful struggle took place in the\r\nbreast of Alessandro--for the renunciation of his creed, a creed in\r\nwhich he must ever in his heart continue to believe, though ostensibly\r\nhe might abjure it--was an appalling step to contemplate. Then to his\r\nmind also came the images of those whom he loved, and who were far away\r\nin Italy:--his aunt, who had been so kind to him, his sister whom he\r\nknew to be so proud of him, and Father Marco, who manifested such deep\r\ninterest in his behalf. But on his ears continued to flow the honeyed\r\nwords and the musical tones of the charming temptress; and, as she\r\ngradually developed to his imagination the destinies upon which he might\r\nenter, offering herself as the eventual prize to be gained by a career\r\ncertain to be pushed on successfully through the medium of a powerful,\r\nthough mysterious influence--Florence, relatives, and friends, became as\r\nsecondary considerations in his mind; and by the time the lady brought\r\nher long address to a conclusion--that address which had grown more\r\nimpassioned and tender as she proceeded--Alessandro threw himself at her\r\nfeet, exclaiming, \"Lovely houri that thou art--beauteous as the maidens\r\nthat dwell in the paradise of thy prophet--I am thine. I am thine!\"\r\n\r\nThe lady extended her right hand, which he took and pressed in rapture\r\nto his lips. But the next moment she rose lightly to her feet, and\r\nassuming a demeanor befitting a royal sultana, said in a sweet, though\r\nimpressive tone:\r\n\r\n\"We must now part--thou to enter on thy career of fame, I to set in\r\nmotion every spring within my reach to advance thee to the pinnacle of\r\nglory and power. Henceforth thy name is Ibrahim! Go, then, my Ibrahim,\r\nand throw thyself at the feet of the reis-effendi, and that great\r\nminister will forthwith present thee to Piri Pasha, the grand vizier.\r\nToil diligently--labor arduously--and the rest concerns me. Go, then, my\r\nIbrahim, I say, and enter on the path which will lead thee to the summit\r\nof fame and power!\"\r\n\r\nShe extended her arms toward him--he snatched her to his breast, and\r\ncovered her cheeks with kisses. In that paradise of charms he could have\r\nreveled forever; but the tender caresses lasted not beyond a few\r\nmoments, for the lady tore herself away from his embrace and hurried\r\ninto an adjacent apartment. Alessandro--or rather, the renegade,\r\nIbrahim--passed into the anteroom where his guide, the female slave,\r\nawaited his return. She conducted him back to the hall, and advanced\r\ntoward the door of the voluptuous kiosk, where he had changed his\r\nraiment.\r\n\r\n\"Goest thou forth a Christian still, or a true believer?\" she asked\r\nturning suddenly round.\r\n\r\n\"As a Mussulman,\" answered the renegade, while his heart sank within\r\nhim, and remorse already commenced its torture.\r\n\r\n\"Then thou hast no further need of the Christian garb,\" said the slave.\r\n\"Await me here.\"\r\n\r\nShe entered the kiosk, and returned in a few moments with the cap,\r\nwhich, in obedience to her directions, he once more drew on his head and\r\nover his countenance. The slave then led him into the garden, which they\r\ntreaded in profound silence. At length they reached the steps leading\r\ndown to the water, and the slave accompanied him into the boat, which\r\nimmediately shot away from the bank. Alessandro had now ample time for\r\ncalm reflection. The excitement of the hurried incidents of the evening\r\nwas nearly over, and, though his breast was still occupied with the\r\nimage of his beautiful unknown, and with the brilliant prospects which\r\nshe had opened to view, he nevertheless shrank from the foul deed of\r\napostasy which he had vowed to perpetrate. But we have already said that\r\nhe was essentially worldly-minded, and, as he felt convinced that the\r\npetty jealousy of the Florentine Envoy would prevent him from rising\r\nhigher in the diplomatic hierarchy than the post of secretary, he by\r\ndegrees managed to console himself for his renegadism on the score that\r\nit was necessary--the indispensable stepping-stone to the gratification\r\nof his ambition.\r\n\r\nThus by the time the boat touched the landing-place where he had first\r\nentered it, he had succeeded to some extent in subduing the pangs of\r\nremorse. The female slave now bade him remove the cap from his face and\r\nresume his turban. A few moments sufficed to make this change; and he\r\nwas about to step on shore, when the woman caught him by the sleeve of\r\nhis caftan, and, thrusting a small case of sandal-wood into his hand,\r\nsaid: \"She whom you saw ere now, commanded me to give thee this.\"\r\n\r\nThe slave pushed him toward the bank: he obeyed the impulse and landed,\r\nshe remaining in the boat, which instantly darted away again, most\r\nprobably to convey her back to the abode of her charming mistress. On\r\nthe top of the bank the renegade was accosted by the spy whom he had\r\nleft there when he embarked in the skiff.\r\n\r\n\"Allah and the Prophet be praised!\" exclaimed the man, surveying\r\nAlessandro attentively by the light of the lovely moon. \"Thou art now\r\nnumbered amongst the faithful!\"\r\n\r\nThe apostate bit his lips to keep down a sigh of remorse which rose to\r\nthem; and his guide, without uttering another word, led the way to the\r\npalace of the reis-effendi. There Alessandro or Ibrahim, as we must\r\nhenceforth call him--was lodged in a splendid apartment, and had two\r\nslaves appointed to wait upon him. He, however, hastily dismissed them,\r\nand when alone, opened the case that had been placed into his hands by\r\nthe female slave. It contained a varied assortment of jewelry and\r\nprecious stones, constituting a treasure of immense value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE APOSTATE IBRAHIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstantinople, like haughty Rome, is built on seven hills--the houses\r\nbeing so disposed that they do not intercept the view commanded by each\r\non the amphitheatrical acclivities. But the streets are narrow, crooked,\r\nand uneven; and the grand effects of the numerous stately mosques and\r\nnoble edifices are subdued, and in many cases altogether lost, either by\r\nthe very insignificant width of the thoroughfares in which they stand,\r\nor by the contiguity of mean and miserable wooden tenements.\r\n\r\nThe mosque of St. Sophia, once a Christian church, with its magnificent\r\nportico, supported by marble columns, its nine vast folding doors,\r\nadorned with bas-reliefs, and its stupendous dome, a hundred and twenty\r\nfeet in diameter; the mosque of the Sultan Solyman, forming an exact\r\nsquare with four noble towers at the angles, and with its huge cupola,\r\nin the midst; the mosque of the Sultan Ahmed, with its numerous domes,\r\nits tall minarets, and its colonnades supported by marble pillars; and\r\nthe mosque of the Sultana Valida, or queen mother of Mohammed the\r\nFourth, exceeding all other Mussulman churches in the delicacy of its\r\narchitecture and the beauty of its columns of marble and jasper,\r\nsupplied by the ruins of Troy--these are the most remarkable temples in\r\nthe capital of the Ottoman empire.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Bezestein, or exchange, is likewise a magnificent\r\nstructure--consisting of a spacious hall of circular form, built of\r\nfree-stone, and surrounded by shops displaying the richest commodities\r\nof Oriental commerce. In the Ladies' Bazaar there is a marble column of\r\nextraordinary height, and on the sides of which, from the foot to the\r\ncrown, are represented in admirable bas-reliefs the most remarkable\r\nevents which characterized the reign of the Emperor Arcadius, ere the\r\ncapital of Roman dominions of the East fell into the hands of the\r\ndescendants of Osman.\r\n\r\nBut of all the striking edifices at Constantinople, that of the Sultan's\r\nPalace, or seraglio, is the most spacious and the most magnificent.\r\nChristian writers and readers are too apt to confound the seraglio with\r\nthe harem, and to suppose that the former means the apartments belonging\r\nto the sultan's ladies; whereas the word seraglio, or rather _sernil_,\r\nrepresents the entire palace of which the harem, or females' dwelling,\r\nis but a comparatively small portion.\r\n\r\nThe seraglio is a vast inclosure, occupying nearly the entire site of\r\nthe ancient city of Byzantium, and embracing a circumference of five\r\nmiles. It contains nine enormous courts of quadrangular form, and an\r\nimmense number of buildings--constituting a complete town of itself. But\r\nwithin this inclosure dwell upward of ten thousand persons--the entire\r\ncourt of the sultan. There reside the great officers of state, the body\r\nguards, the numerous corps of bostandjis, or gardeners, and baltojis, or\r\nfire-wood purveyors--the corps of white and black eunuchs, the pages,\r\nthe mutes, the dwarfs--the ladies of the harem, and all their numerous\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nThere are nine gates to the palace of the sultan. The principal one\r\nopens on the square of St. Sophia, and is very magnificent in its\r\narchitecture. It is this gate which is called the Sublime Porte--a name\r\nfiguratively given to the court of the sultan, in all histories,\r\nrecords, and diplomatic transactions. It was within the inclosure of the\r\nseraglio that Alessandro Francatelli, whom we shall henceforth call by\r\nhis apostate name of Ibrahim--was lodged in the dwelling of the\r\nreis-effendi or minister of foreign affairs. But in the course of a few\r\ndays the renegade was introduced into the presence of Piri Pasha, the\r\ngrand vizier--that high functionary who exercised a power almost as\r\nextensive and as despotic as that wielded by the sultan himself.\r\n\r\nIbrahim, the apostate, was received by his highness Piri Pasha at a\r\nprivate audience--and the young man exerted all his powers, and called\r\nto his aid all the accomplishments which he possessed, to render himself\r\nagreeable to that great minister. He discoursed in an intelligent manner\r\nupon the policy of Italy and Austria, and gave the grand vizier\r\nconsiderable information relative to the customs, resources, and\r\ncondition of these countries. Then, when the vizier touched upon lighter\r\nmatters, Ibrahim showed how well he was already acquainted with the\r\nworks of the most eminent Turkish poets and historians; and the art of\r\nmusic being mentioned, he gave the minister a specimen of his\r\nproficiency on the violin. Piri Pasha was charmed with the young\r\nrenegade, whom he immediately took into his service as one of his\r\nprivate secretaries.\r\n\r\nNot many weeks elapsed before the fame of Ibrahim's accomplishments and\r\nrare talents reached the ears of the sultan, Solyman the Magnificent;\r\nand the young renegade was honored with an audience by the ruler of the\r\nEast. On this occasion he exerted himself to please even more\r\ntriumphantly than when he was introduced to the grand vizier; and the\r\nsultan commanded that henceforth Ibrahim should remain attached to his\r\nperson in the capacity of keeper of the imperial archives.\r\n\r\nWe should observe that the dispatches which the Florentine Envoy wrote\r\nto the government of the republic, contained but a brief and vague\r\nallusion to the apostasy of Alessandro Francatelli; merely mentioning\r\nthat the youth had become a Mussulman, and entered the service of the\r\ngrand vizier, but not stating either the name which he had adopted or\r\nthe brilliant prospects which had so suddenly and marvelously opened\r\nbefore him. The Florentine Embassador treated the matter thus lightly,\r\nbecause he was afraid of incurring the blame of his government for not\r\nhaving kept a more stringent watch over his subordinate, were he to\r\nattach any importance to the fact of Alessandro's apostasy. But he hoped\r\nthat by merely glancing at the event as one scarcely worth special\r\nnotice, the Council of Florence would be led to treat it with equal\r\nlevity. Nor was the embassador deceived in his calculation; and thus the\r\naccounts which reached Florence relative to Alessandro's renegadism--and\r\nwhich were not indeed communicated to the council until some months\r\nafter the occurrence of the apostasy itself--were vague and indefinite\r\nto a degree.\r\n\r\nAnd had Ibrahim no remorse? Did he never think of his lovely sister\r\nFlora, and of his affectionate aunt who, in his boyhood, had made such\r\ngreat and generous sacrifices to rear them honorably? Oh! yes;--but a\r\nmore powerful idea dominated the remembrance of kindred, and the\r\nattachment to home--and that idea was ambition! Moreover, the hope of\r\nspeedily achieving that greatness which was to render him eligible and\r\nworthy to possess the charming being whose powerful influence seemed to\r\nsurround him with a constant halo of protection, and to soothe down all\r\nthe asperities which are usually found in the career of those who rise\r\nsuddenly and rise highly--this ardent, longing hope not only encouraged\r\nhim to put forth all his energies to make himself master of a glorious\r\nposition, but also subdued to no small extent the feelings of\r\ncompunction which would otherwise have been too bitter, too agonizing to\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nHis mind was, moreover, constantly occupied. When not in attendance upon\r\nthe sultan, he devoted all his time to render himself intimately\r\nacquainted with the laws, polity, diplomatic history, resources,\r\ncondition, and finances of the Ottoman Empire; he also studied the\r\nTurkish literature, and practiced composition, both in prose and verse,\r\nin the language of that country which was now his own! But think not,\r\nreader, that in his heart he was a Mussulman, or that he had\r\nextinguished the light of Christianity within his soul. No--oh! no; the\r\nmore he read on the subject of the Mohammedan system of theology, the\r\nmore he became convinced not only of its utter falsity, but also of its\r\nincompatibility with the progress of civilization. Nevertheless, he\r\ndared not pray to the True God whom he had renounced with his lips; but\r\nthere was a secret adoration, an interior worship of the Saviour, which\r\nhe could not and sought not to subdue.\r\n\r\nSolyman the Magnificent, was an enlightened prince, and a generous\r\npatron of the arts and sciences. He did not persecute the Christians,\r\nbecause he knew, in his own heart, that they were further advanced in\r\nall human ideas and institutions than the Ottomans. He was, therefore,\r\ndelighted whenever a talented Christian embraced the Moslem faith and\r\nentered his service; and his keen perception speedily led him to discern\r\nand appreciate all the merits and acquirements of his favorite Ibrahim.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things at Constantinople, when those rapidly\r\nsuccessive incidents, which we have already related, took place in\r\nFlorence. At this time immense preparations were being made by the\r\nsultan for an expedition against the Island of Rhodes, then in the\r\npossession of the Knights of St. John, commanded by their grand master,\r\nVilliers of Isle Adam.\r\n\r\nThis chieftain, aware of the danger which menaced him, dispatched envoys\r\nto the courts of Rome, Genoa, Venice, and Florence, imploring those\r\npowers to send him assistance against the expected invasion of the\r\nTurks. Each of these states hastened to comply with this request; and\r\nnumerous bodies of auxiliaries sailed from various ports in Italy to\r\nfight beneath the glorious banner of Villiers of Isle Adam, one of the\r\nstanchest veteran champions of Christendom.\r\n\r\nThus, at the very time when Nisida and Wagner were united in the bonds\r\nof love on the island of which they were the possessors--while, too,\r\nIsaachar the Jew languished in the prisons of the Inquisition of\r\nFlorence, at which city the chivalrous-hearted Manuel d'Orsini tarried\r\nto hasten on the trial and give his testimony in favor of the\r\nIsraelite--and moreover while Flora, and the Countess Giulia dwelt in\r\nthe strictest retirement with the young maiden's aunt--at this period,\r\nwe say, a fleet of three hundred sail quitted Constantinople under the\r\ncommand of the kapitan-pasha, or lord high admiral, and proceeded toward\r\nthe Island of Rhodes. At the same time, Solyman the Magnificent crossed\r\ninto Asia Minor, and placing himself at the head of an army of a hundred\r\nthousand men, commenced his march toward the coast facing the island,\r\nand where he intended to embark on his warlike expedition. His favorite\r\nIbrahim accompanied him, as did also the Grand Vizier Piri Pasha, and\r\nthe principal dignitaries of the empire.\r\n\r\nIt was in the spring of 1521 that the Ottoman fleet received the army on\r\nboard at the Cape in the Gulf of Macri, which is only separated by a\r\nvery narrow strait from the Island of Rhodes; and in the evening of the\r\nsame day on which the troops had thus embarked, the mighty armament\r\nappeared off the capital city of the Knights of St. John.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE SIEGE OF RHODES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, salvoes of artillery throughout the fleet\r\nannounced to the inhabitants and garrison of Rhodes, that the sultan was\r\nabout to effect a landing with his troops.\r\n\r\nThe debarkment was not resisted; for it was protected by the cannonade\r\nwhich the ships directed against the walls of the city, and the\r\nChristians had no vessel capable of demonstrating any hostility against\r\nthe mighty fleet commanded by the kapitan-pasha.\r\n\r\nVilliers of Isle Adam, the generalissimo of the Christian forces, had\r\nreduced to ashes all circumjacent villages, and received their\r\ninhabitants into the city itself. But the Ottomans cared not for the\r\nwaste and desolation thus created around the walls of the city; but\r\nwhile their artillery, alike on land and by sea, maintained an incessant\r\nfire on the town, they threw up works of defense and established depots\r\nof provisions and ammunition. The sultan went in person accompanied by\r\nIbrahim, and attended by a numerous escort, to reconnoiter the\r\nfortifications, and inspect the position of his troops.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, Villiers of Isle Adam distributed his forces in such\r\na manner that the warriors of each nation defended particular gates.\r\nThus the corps of Spaniards, French, Germans, English, Portuguese,\r\nItalian, Auvergnese and Provincials, respectively defended eight of the\r\ngates of Rhodes; while the lord general himself, with his body-guard,\r\ntook his post at the ninth. For the knights of Rhodes comprised natives\r\nof nearly all Christian countries, and the mode in which Villiers thus\r\nallotted a gate to the defense of the warriors of each nation, gave an\r\nimpulse to that emulative spirit which ever induces the soldiers of one\r\nclime to vie with those of another.\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman troops were disposed in the following manner: Ayaz Pasha,\r\nBeglerbeg (or governor) of Roumilia, found himself placed in front of\r\nthe walls and gates defended by the French and Germans; Ahmed Pasha was\r\nopposed to the Spaniards and Auvergnese; Mustapha Pasha had to contend\r\nwith the English: Kasim, Beglerbeg of Anatolia, was to direct the attack\r\nagainst the bastion and gates occupied by the natives of Provence; the\r\nGrand Vizier, Piri Pasha, was opposed to the Portuguese, and the sultan\r\nhimself undertook the assault against the defenses occupied by the\r\nItalians.\r\n\r\nFor several days there was much skirmishing, but no advantage was gained\r\nby the Ottomans. Mines and countermines were employed on both sides, and\r\nthose executed by the Christians effected terrible havoc amongst the\r\nTurks. At length in pursuance of the advice of the renegade Ibrahim, the\r\nsultan ordered a general assault to be made upon the city, and heralds\r\nwent through the entire encampment, proclaiming the imperial command.\r\nTidings of this resolution were conveyed into the city by means of the\r\nChristians' spies; and while the Ottomans were preparing for the attack,\r\nVilliers of Isle Adam was actively employed in adopting all possible\r\nmeans for the defense.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, the general assault commenced, and the aga (or colonel) of\r\nthe janizaries succeeded in planting his banner on the gate intrusted to\r\nthe care of the Spaniards and Auvergnese. But this success was merely\r\ntemporary in that quarter; for the Ottomans were beaten back with such\r\nimmense slaughter, that fifteen thousand of their choicest troops were\r\ncut to pieces in the breach and the ditch. But still the assault was\r\nprosecuted in every quarter and every point, and the Christian warriors\r\nacquitted themselves nobly in the defense of the city. The women of\r\nRhodes manifested a courage and zeal which history has loved to record\r\nas most honorable to their sex. Some of them carried about bread and\r\nwine to recruit the fainting and refresh the wearied, others were ready\r\nwith bandages and lint to stanch the blood which flowed from the\r\nwounded, some conveyed earth in wheelbarrows, to stop up the breaches\r\nmade in the walls, and others bore along immense stones to hurl down\r\nupon the assailants.\r\n\r\nOh! it was a glorious, but a sad and mournful sight--that death-struggle\r\nof the valiant Christians against the barbarism of the East. And many\r\ntouching proofs of woman's courage and daring characterized that\r\nmemorable siege. Especially does this fact merit our attention:--The\r\nwife of a Christian captain, seeing her husband slain, and the enemy\r\ngaining ground rapidly, embraced her two children tenderly, made the\r\nsign of the cross upon their brows, and then, having stabbed them to the\r\nheart, threw them into the midst of a burning building near, exclaiming,\r\n\"The infidels will not now be able, my poor darlings, to wreak their\r\nvengeance on you, alive or dead!\" In another moment she seized her dead\r\nhusband's sword, and plunging into the thickest of the fight, met a\r\ndeath worthy of a heroine.\r\n\r\nThe rain now began to fall in torrents, washing away the floods of gore\r\nwhich, since daybreak, had dyed the bastions and the wall; and the\r\nassault continued as arduously as the defense was maintained with\r\ndesperation. Solyman commanded in person the division which was opposed\r\nto the gate and the fort intrusted by the lord general of the Christians\r\nto the care of the Italian auxiliaries. But, though it was now past\r\nnoon, and the sultan had prosecuted his attack on that point with\r\nunabated vigor since the dawn, no impression had yet been made. The\r\nItalians fought with a heroism which bade defiance to the numerical\r\nsuperiority of their assailants; for they were led on by a young\r\nchieftain who, beneath an effeminate exterior, possessed the soul of a\r\nlion. Clad in a complete suit of polished armor, and with crimson plumes\r\nwaving from his steel helmet, to which no visor was attached, that\r\nyouthful leader threw himself into the thickest of the medley, sought\r\nthe very points where danger appeared most terrible--and, alike by his\r\nexample and his words, encouraged those whom he commanded to dispute\r\nevery inch of ground with the Moslem assailants.\r\n\r\nThe sultan was enraged when he beheld the success with which that\r\nItalian chieftain rallied his men again after every rebuff; and, calling\r\nto Ibrahim to keep near him, Solyman the Magnificent advanced toward the\r\nbreach which his cannon had already effected in the walls defended so\r\ngallantly by the Italian auxiliaries. And now, in a few minutes, behold\r\nthe sultan himself, nerved with wonderful energy, rushing on--scimiter\r\nin hand--and calling on the young Italian warrior to measure weapons\r\nwith him. The Christian chieftain understood not the words which the\r\nsultan uttered, but full well did he comprehend the anxiety of that\r\ngreat monarch to do battle with him; and the curved scimiter and the\r\nstraight, cross-handled sword clashed together in a moment. The young\r\nwarrior knew that his opponent was the sultan, whose imperial rank was\r\ndenoted by the turban which he wore; and the hope of inflicting\r\nchastisement on the author of all the bloodshed which had taken place on\r\nthe walls of Rhodes inspired the youth with a courage perfectly\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nNot many minutes had this combat lasted, before Solyman was thrown down\r\nin the breach, and the cross-handled sword of his conqueror was about to\r\ndrink his heart's blood, when the renegade Ibrahim dashed forward from\r\namidst the confused masses of those who were fighting around, and by a\r\ndesperate effort hurled the young Italian warrior backward.\r\n\r\n\"I owe thee my life, Ibrahim,\" said the sultan, springing upon his feet.\r\n\"But hurt not him who has combated so gallantly: we must respect the\r\nbrave!\"\r\n\r\nThe Italian chieftain had been completely stunned by his fall; he was,\r\ntherefore, easily made prisoner and carried off to Ibrahim's tent.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment a messenger from Ahmed Pasha presented to the\r\nsultan a letter, in which was stated that the grand master, Villiers of\r\nIsle Adam, anxious to put a stop to the fearful slaughter that was\r\nprogressing, had offered to capitulate on honorable terms. This\r\nproposition was immediately agreed to by the sultan, and a suspension of\r\nhostilities was proclaimed around the walls. The Ottomans retired to\r\ntheir camp, having lost upward of thirty thousand men during the deadly\r\nstrife of a few hours; and the Christians had now leisure to ascertain\r\nthe extent of their own disasters, which were proportionately appalling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Ibrahim had ordered his prisoner, the young Italian\r\nchieftain, to be conveyed to his tent; and when the renegade's slaves\r\nhad disencumbered the Christian of his armor, he began to revive. As\r\nIbrahim bent over him, administering restoratives, a suspicion, which\r\nhad already struck him the moment he first beheld his face, grew\r\nstronger and stronger; and the apostate at length became convinced that\r\nhe had seen that countenance on some former occasion.\r\n\r\nOrdering his slaves to withdraw, Ibrahim remained alone with his\r\nprisoner, who was now able to sit up on the sofa and gaze around him.\r\n\r\n\"I understand it all!\" he exclaimed, the blood rushing back to his pale\r\ncheek; \"I am in the power of the barbarians!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, call us not harsh names, brave chieftain,\" said Ibrahim, \"seeing\r\nthat we do not treat you unworthily.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was wrong!\" cried the prisoner; then, fixing his fine blue eyes upon\r\nthe renegade, he added, \"Were you not habited as a Moslem, I should\r\nconceive, by the purity with which you speak my native language, that\r\nyou were a Christian, and an Italian.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can speak many languages with equal fluency,\" said Ibrahim,\r\nevasively, as a pang shot through his heart. \"But tell me thy name,\r\nChristian--for thou art a brave man, although so young.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my own country,\" answered the youth, proudly, \"I am called the Count\r\nof Riverola.\"\r\n\r\nWe have before stated that Ibrahim was the complete master of his\r\nemotions: but it required all his powers of self-possession to subdue\r\nthem now, when the name of that family into which he was well aware his\r\nsister had entered fell upon his ears. His suspicion was well founded;\r\nhe had indeed seen Francisco before this day--had seen him when he was a\r\nmere boy, in Florence, for Alessandro was three or four years older than\r\nthe young count. But he had never, in his native land, exchanged a word\r\nwith Francisco; he had merely, occasionally, seen him in public; and it\r\nwas quite evident that even if Francisco had ever noticed him at that\r\ntime, he did not recollect him now. Neither did Ibrahim wish the young\r\ncount to ascertain who he was; for the only thing which the renegade\r\never feared was the encounter of any one who had known him as a\r\nChristian, and who might justly reproach him for that apostasy which had\r\nled him to profess Mohammedanism.\r\n\r\n\"Lord Count of Riverola,\" said Ibrahim, after a short pause, \"you shall\r\nbe treated in a manner becoming your rank and your bravery. Such,\r\nindeed, was the command of my imperial master, the most glorious sultan;\r\nbut even had no such order been issued, my admiration of your gallant\r\ndeportment in this day's strife would lead to the same result.\"\r\n\r\n\"My best thanks are due for these assurances,\" returned Francisco. \"But\r\ntell me how fares the war without?\"\r\n\r\n\"The grand master has proffered a capitulation, which has been\r\naccepted,\" answered Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n\"A capitulation!\" exclaimed Francisco. \"Oh! it were better to die in\r\ndefense of the cross, than live to behold the crescent triumphant on the\r\nwalls of Rhodes!\"\r\n\r\n\"The motive of the grand master was a humane one,\" observed Ibrahim; \"he\r\nhas agreed to capitulate, to put an end to the terrific slaughter that\r\nis going on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless the lord general acts in accordance with the dictates of a\r\nmatured wisdom!\" exclaimed the Count of Riverola.\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship was the leader of the Italian auxiliaries?\" said Ibrahim,\r\ninterrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"Such was the honorable office intrusted to me,\" was the reply. \"When\r\nmessengers from Villiers of Isle-Adam arrived in Florence, beseeching\r\nsuccor against this invasion, which has, alas! proved too successful, I\r\npanted for occupation to distract my mind from ever pondering on the\r\nheavy misfortunes which had overtaken me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Misfortunes!\" exclaimed Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--misfortunes of such a nature that the mere thought of them is\r\nmadness!\" cried Francisco, in an excited tone. \"First, a beauteous and\r\namiable girl--one who, though of humble origin, was endowed with virtues\r\nand qualifications that might have fitted her to adorn a palace, and\r\nwhom I fondly, devotedly loved--was-snatched from me. She disappeared I\r\nknow not how! All trace of her was suddenly lost, as if the earth had\r\nswallowed her up and closed over her again! This blow was in itself\r\nterrible. But it came not alone. A few days elapsed, and my sister--my\r\ndearly beloved sister--also disappeared, and in the same mysterious\r\nmanner. Not a trace of her remained--and what makes this second\r\naffliction the more crushing--the more overwhelming, is that she is deaf\r\nand dumb! Oh! Heaven grant me the power to resist, to bear up against\r\nthese crowning miseries! Vain were all my inquiries--useless was all the\r\nsearch I instituted to discover whither had gone the being whom I would\r\nhave made my wife, and the sister who was ever so devoted to me! At\r\nlength, driven to desperation, when weeks had passed and they returned\r\nnot--goaded on to madness by bitter, bitter memories--I resolved to\r\ndevote myself to the service of the cross. With my gold I raised and\r\nequipped a gallant band; and a favoring breeze wafted us from Leghorn to\r\nthis island. The grand master received me with open arms; and, forming\r\nan estimation of my capacities far above my deserts, placed me in\r\ncommand of all the Italian auxiliaries. You know the rest; I fought with\r\nall my energy, and your sultan was within the grasp of death, when you\r\nrushed forward and saved him. The result is that I am your prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"So young--and yet so early acquainted with such deep affliction!\"\r\nexclaimed Ibrahim. \"But can you form no idea, Christian, of the cause of\r\nthat double disappearance? Had your sister no attendants who could throw\r\nthe least light upon the subject?\" he asked, with the hope of eliciting\r\nsome tidings relative to his own sister, the beauteous Flora.\r\n\r\n\"I dare not reflect thereon!\" cried Francisco, the tears starting into\r\nhis eyes. \"For, alas! Florence has long been infested by a desperate\r\nband of lawless wretches--and my God! I apprehend the worst--the very\r\nworst.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, he rose and paced the spacious tent with agitated steps;\r\nfor this conversation had awakened in his mind all the bitter thoughts\r\nand dreadful alarms which he had essayed to subdue amidst the excitement\r\nand peril of war. A slave now entered to inform Ibrahim that the sultan\r\ncommanded his immediate presence in the imperial pavilion.\r\n\r\n\"Christian,\" said Ibrahim, as he rose to obey this mandate, \"wilt thou\r\npledge me thy word, as a noble and a knight, not to attempt to escape\r\nfrom this tent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I pledge my word,\" answered Francisco, \"seeing that thou thyself art so\r\ngenerous to me.\"\r\n\r\nIbrahim then went forth; but he paused for a few moments outside the\r\ntent to command his slaves to serve up choice refreshments to the\r\nprisoner. He then hastened to the pavilion of the sultan, whom he found\r\nseated upon a throne, surrounded by the beglerbegs, the councilors of\r\nstate, the viziers, the lieutenant-generals of the army, and all the\r\nhigh dignitaries who had accompanied him on his expedition. Ibrahim\r\nadvanced and prostrated himself at the foot of his throne; and at the\r\nsame moment two of the high functionaries present threw a caftan of\r\nhonor over his shoulders--a ceremony which signified that the sultan had\r\nconferred upon him the title of beglerbeg, or \"prince of princes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rise, Ibrahim Pasha!\" exclaimed Solyman, \"and take thy place in our\r\ncouncils, for Allah and his prophet have this day made thee their\r\ninstrument to save the life of thy sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThe newly-created pasha touched the imperial slipper with his lips, and\r\nthen rising from his prostrate position, received the congratulations of\r\nthe high functionaries assembled.\r\n\r\nThus it was that in a few months, protected by that secret influence\r\nwhich was hurrying him so rapidly along in his ambitious career, the\r\nItalian apostate attained to a high rank in the Ottoman Empire; but he\r\nwas yet to reach the highest, next to that of the sovereign, ere he\r\ncould hope to receive the fair hand of his mysterious patroness as the\r\ncrowning joy of his prosperity, for her image, her charming image, ever\r\ndwelt in his mind, and an ardent fancy often depicted her as she\r\nappeared, in all the splendor of her beauty, reclining on the sofa at\r\nthe dwelling to which he had been conducted with so much precaution, as\r\ndetailed in a preceding chapter. On the following day peace was formally\r\nconcluded between the Ottomans and the knights of Rhodes, the latter\r\nconsenting to surrender the island to the formidable invaders. An\r\nexchange of prisoners was the result, and Francisco, Count of Riverola,\r\nagain found himself free within twenty-four hours after his capture.\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship is now about to sail for your own clime,\" said Ibrahim,\r\nwhen the moment of separation came. \"Is there aught within my power that\r\nI can do to testify my friendship for one so brave and chivalrous as\r\nthou art?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, great pasha!\" exclaimed Francisco, who felt his sympathy\r\nirresistibly attracted toward Ibrahim, he knew not why, \"but, on the\r\nother hand, receive my heartfelt thanks for the kindness which I have\r\nexperienced during the few hours I have been thy guest.\"\r\n\r\n\"The history of thy afflictions has so much moved me,\" said Ibrahim\r\nPasha, after a brief pause, \"that the interest I experience in your\r\nbehalf will not cease when you shall be no longer here. If then you\r\nwould bear in mind the request I am about to make, gallant\r\nChristian----\"\r\n\r\n\"Name it!\" cried Francisco; \"'tis already granted!\"\r\n\r\n\"Write me from Florence,\" added Ibrahim, \"and acquaint me with the\r\nsuccess of thy researches after thy lost sister and the maiden whom thou\r\nlovest. The ships of Leghorn trade to Constantinople, whither I shall\r\nspeedily return, and it will not be a difficult matter to forward a\r\nletter to me occasionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be unworthy of the kind interest you take in my behalf, great\r\npasha, were I to neglect this request,\" answered Francisco. \"Oh! may the\r\ngood angels grant that I may yet recover my beloved sister Nisida, and\r\nthat sweetest of maidens--Flora Francatelli!\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco was too overpowered by his own emotions to observe the sudden\r\nstart which Ibrahim gave, and the pallor which instantaneously\r\noverspread his cheeks as the name of his sister thus burst upon his\r\nears--that sister who, beyond doubt, had disappeared most strangely.\r\n\r\nBut, with an almost superhuman effort, he subdued any further expression\r\nof the agony of his feelings, and, taking Francisco's hand, said, in a\r\nlow, deep tone: \"Count of Riverola, I rely upon your solemn promise to\r\nwrite me, and write soon and often. I shall experience a lively pleasure\r\nin receiving and responding to your letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not that I shall forget my promise, your highness,\" responded\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nHe then took leave of Ibrahim Pasha, and returned to the city of Rhodes,\r\nwhence he embarked on the same day for Italy, accompanied by the few\r\nFlorentine auxiliaries who had survived the dreadful slaughter on the\r\nramparts. The hustle and excitement attending the departure from Rhodes\r\nsomewhat absorbed the grief which Ibrahim felt on account of the\r\nmysterious disappearance of his sister Flora.\r\n\r\nSolyman left a sufficient force, under an able commander, to garrison\r\nthe island, which was speedily evacuated by Villiers of Isle Adam and\r\nhis knights; and by the middle of May the sultan, attended by Ibrahim\r\nand the other dignitaries of the empire, once more entered the gates of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nNot many days had elapsed when, at a divan or state council, at which\r\nSolyman the Magnificent himself presided, Ibrahim Pasha was desired to\r\ngive his opinion upon a particular question then under discussion. The\r\nrenegade expressed his sentiments in a manner at variance with the\r\npolicy recommended by the grand vizier; and this high functionary\r\nreplied, in terms of bitterness and even grossness, at the same time\r\nreproaching Ibrahim with ingratitude. The apostate delivered a rejoinder\r\nwhich completely electrified the divan. He repudiated the charge of\r\ningratitude on the ground of being influenced only by his duty toward\r\nthe sultan; and he entered upon a complete review of the policy of the\r\nGrand Vizier Piri Pasha. He proved that the commerce of the country had\r\ngreatly fallen off--that the revenues had diminished--that arrears were\r\ndue to the army and navy--that several minor powers had not paid their\r\nusual tribute for some years past--and, in a word, drew such a frightful\r\npicture of the maladministration and misrule, that the grand vizier was\r\noverwhelmed with confusion, and the sultan and other listeners were\r\nstruck with the lamentable truth of all which had fallen from the lips\r\nof Ibrahim Pasha. Nor less were they astonished at the wonderful\r\nintimacy which he displayed with even the minutest details of the\r\nmachinery of the government; in a word, his triumph was complete.\r\n\r\nSolyman the Magnificent broke up the divan in haste, ordering the\r\nmembers of the council to return each immediately to his own abode. In\r\nthe evening a functionary of the imperial household was sent to the\r\npalace of the grand vizier to demand the seals of office; and thus fell\r\nPiri Pasha.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when the sultan sent to order Ibrahim Pasha to wait upon\r\nhim without delay. The conference that ensued was long and interesting,\r\nand it was already near daybreak when messengers were dispatched to the\r\nvarious members of the divan to summon them to the seraglio. Then, in\r\nthe presence of all the rank and talent in the capital, the sultan\r\ndemanded of Ibrahim whether he felt sufficient confidence in himself to\r\nundertake the weight and responsibility of office. All eyes were fixed\r\nearnestly upon that mere youth of scarcely twenty-three, who was thus\r\nsolemnly adjured.\r\n\r\nIn a firm voice he replied that with the favor of the sultan and the\r\nblessing of the Most High, he did not despair of being enabled to\r\nrestore the Ottoman Empire to its late prosperity and glory. The\r\nastronomer of the court declared that the hour was favorable to invest\r\nthe new grand vizier with the insignia of office; and at the moment when\r\nthe call to prayer, \"God is great!\" sounded from every minaret in\r\nConstantinople, Ibrahim Pasha received the imperial seals from the hand\r\nof the sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW GRAND VIZIER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe call to prayer, \"_God is great_,\" sounded from every minaret in\r\nConstantinople, when Solyman the Magnificent raised the renegade Ibrahim\r\nto a rank second only to his own imperial station. The newly appointed\r\nprime minister received the congratulations of the assembled dignitaries\r\nof the empire; and when this ceremony was accomplished, he repaired to\r\nthe palace of the viziership, which Piri Pasha had vacated during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nA numerous escort of slaves, and a guard of honor, composed of an entire\r\ncompany of Janizaries, attended Ibrahim to his new abode, the streets\r\nthrough which he passed being lined with spectators anxious to obtain a\r\nglimpse of the new minister.\r\n\r\nBut calm, almost passionless, was the expression of Ibrahim's\r\ncountenance: though he had attained to his present high station\r\nspeedily, yet he had not reached it unexpectedly; and, even in the\r\nmoment of this, his proud triumph, there was gall mingled with the cup\r\nof honey which he quaffed. For, oh! the light of Christianity was not\r\nextinguished within his breast; and though it no longer gleamed there to\r\ninspire and to cheer, it nevertheless had strength enough to burn with\r\nreproachful flame.\r\n\r\nThe multitudes cheered and prostrated themselves as he passed; but his\r\nsalutation was cold and indifferent, and he felt at that moment that he\r\nwould rather have been wandering through the Vale of Arno, hand-in-hand\r\nwith his sister, than be welcomed in the streets of Constantinople as\r\nthe Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire!\r\n\r\nO crime! thou may'st deck thy brow with flowers, and adorn thy garments\r\nwith the richest gems--thou may'st elicit the shouts of admiring\r\nmyriads, and proceed attended by guards ready to hew down those who\r\nwould treat thee with disrespect--thou may'st quit the palace of a\r\nmighty sovereign to repair to a palace of thine own--and in thy hands\r\nthou may'st hold the destinies of millions of human beings; but thou\r\ncanst not subdue the still small voice that whispers reproachfully in\r\nthine ear, nor pluck from thy bosom the undying worm.\r\n\r\nThough Ibrahim Pasha felt acutely, yet his countenance, as we have\r\nbefore said, expressed nothing--he was still sufficiently master of his\r\nemotions to retain them pent up in his own breast; and if he could not\r\nappear perfectly happy, he would not allow the world to perceive that\r\nhis soul harbored secret care. He entered the palace now destined to\r\nbecome his abode, and found himself the lord and master of an\r\nestablishment such as no Christian monarch in Europe possessed. But as\r\nhe passed through marble halls and perfumed corridors lined with\r\nprostrate slaves--as he contemplated the splendor and magnificence, the\r\nwealth and the luxury, by which he was now surrounded--and as he even\r\ndwelt upon the hope--nay, the more than hope, the conviction, that he\r\nshould full soon be blest with the hand of a being whose ravishing\r\nbeauty was ever present to his mental vision--that still small voice\r\nwhich he could not hush, appeared to ask what avail it was for a man, if\r\nhe gain the whole world but lose his own soul?\r\n\r\nBut Ibrahim Pasha was not the man to give way to the influence of even\r\nreflections so harrowing as these; and he immediately applied himself to\r\nthe business of the state, to divert his mind from unpleasurable\r\nmeditations. Holding a levee that same day, he received and confirmed in\r\ntheir offices all the subordinate ministers; he then dispatched letters\r\nto the various governors of provinces to announce to them his elevation\r\nto the grand viziership; and he conferred the Pashalic of Egypt upon the\r\nfallen minister, Piri Pasha. In the afternoon he granted audiences to\r\nthe embassadors of the Christian powers; but the Florentine envoy, it\r\nshould be observed, had quitted Constantinople some weeks\r\npreviously--indeed, at the time when the sultan undertook his expedition\r\nagainst Rhodes; for the representative of the republic had entirely\r\nfailed in the mission which had been intrusted to him by his government.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, when it was quite dusk, Ibrahim retired to his\r\napartment; and hastily disguising himself in a mean attire, he issued\r\nforth by a private gate at the back part of the palace. Intent upon\r\nputting into execution a scheme which he had hastily planned that very\r\nafternoon, he repaired to the quarter inhabited by the Christians. There\r\nhe entered a house of humble appearance where dwelt a young Greek, with\r\nwhom he had been on friendly terms at that period when his present\r\ngreatness was totally unforeseen--indeed, while he was simply the\r\nprivate secretary of the Florentine envoy. He knew that Demetrius was\r\npoor, intelligent and trustworthy; and it was precisely an agent of this\r\nnature that Ibrahim required for the project which he had in view.\r\n\r\nDemetrius--such was the young Greek's name--was seated in a small and\r\nmeanly furnished apartment, in a desponding manner, and scarcely\r\nappearing to notice the efforts which his sister, a beautiful maiden of\r\nnineteen, was exerting to console him, when the door opened, and a man\r\ndressed as a water-carrier entered the room.\r\n\r\nThe young Greek started up angrily, for he thought the visitor was one\r\nof the numerous petty creditors to whom he was indebted, and whose\r\ndemands he was unable to liquidate; but the second glance which he cast,\r\nby the light of the lamp that burnt feebly on the table, toward the\r\ncountenance of the meanly dressed individual, convinced him of his\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n\"His highness the grand vizier!\" ejaculated Demetrius, falling on his\r\nknees; \"Calanthe!\" he added, speaking rapidly to his sister, \"bow down\r\nto the representative of the sultan!\"\r\n\r\nBut Ibrahim hastened to put an end to this ceremony, and assured the\r\nbrother and sister that he came thither as a friend.\r\n\r\n\"A friend!\" repeated Demetrius, as if doubting whether his ears heard\r\naright; \"is it possible that Heaven has indeed sent me a friend in one\r\nwho has the power to raise me and this poor suffering maiden from the\r\ndepths of our bitter, bitter poverty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou suppose that my rapid elevation has rendered me unmindful of\r\nformer friendships?\" demanded Ibrahim; although, had he not his own\r\npurposes to serve, he would never have thought of seeking the abode, nor\r\ninquiring after the welfare of the humble acquaintance of his obscure\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe young Greek knew not, however, the thorough selfishness of the\r\nrenegade's character; and he poured forth his gratitude for the vizier's\r\nkindness and condescension with the most sincere and heart-felt fervor:\r\nwhile the beauteous Calanthe's large dark eyes swam in tears of hope and\r\njoy, as she surveyed with mingled wonder and admiration the countenance\r\nof that high functionary whose rapid rise to power had electrified the\r\nOttoman capital, and whom she now saw for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Demetrius,\" said Ibrahim, \"I know your worth--I have appreciated your\r\ntalents; and I feel deeply for the orphan condition of your sister and\r\nyourself. It is in my power to afford you an employment whereby you may\r\nrender me good service, and which shall be liberally rewarded. You are\r\nalready acquainted with much of my former history; and you have often\r\nheard me speak, in terms of love and affection, of my sister Flora.\r\nDuring my recent sojourn in the island of Rhodes, a Florentine nobleman,\r\nthe Count of Riverola, became my prisoner. From him I learned that he\r\nwas attached to my sister, and his language led me to believe that he\r\nwas loved in return. But alas! some few months ago Flora suddenly\r\ndisappeared; and the Count of Riverola instituted a vain search to\r\ndiscover her. Too pure-minded was she to fly of her own accord from her\r\nnative city; too chaste and too deeply imbued with virtuous principles\r\nwas she to admit the suspicion that she had fled with a vile seducer.\r\nNo; force or treachery--if not _murder_,\" added Ibrahim, in a tone\r\nindicative of profound emotion, \"must have caused her sudden\r\ndisappearance. The Count of Riverola has doubtless ere now arrived in\r\nItaly; and his researches will most assuredly be renewed. He promised to\r\ncommunicate to me the result, but as he knew not to whom that pledge was\r\ngiven--as he recognized not in me the brother of the Flora whom he\r\nloves--I am fearful lest he forget or neglect the promise. It is,\r\ntherefore, my intention to send a secret agent to Florence--an agent who\r\nwill convey rich gifts to my aunt, but without revealing the name of him\r\nwho sends them--an agent, in a word, who may minister to the wants and\r\ninterests of my family, and report to me whether my beloved sister be\r\nyet found, and if so, the causes of her disappearance. It seems to me\r\nthat you, Demetrius, are well fitted for this mission. Your knowledge of\r\nthe Italian language, your discreetness, your sound judgment, all render\r\nyou competent to enact the part of a good genius watching over the\r\ninterests of those who must not be allowed to learn whence flow the\r\nbounties which suddenly pour upon them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious lord,\" said the young Greek, his countenance radiant with joy.\r\n\"I will never lose any opportunity of manifesting my devotion to the\r\ncause in which your highness condescends to employ me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will proceed alone to Italy,\" continued Ibrahim; \"and on your\r\narrival in Florence, you will adopt a modest and reserved mode of life,\r\nso that no unpleasant queries may arise as to your object in visiting\r\nthe republic.\"\r\n\r\nDemetrius turned a rapidly inquiring glance upon Calanthe, who hastened\r\nto observe that she did not fear being left unprotected in the city of\r\nConstantinople. Ibrahim placed a heavy purse and a case containing many\r\ncostly jewels in the hands of Demetrius, saying: \"These are as an\r\nearnest of my favor and friendship;\"--then, producing a second case,\r\ntied round with a silken cord, he added, \"And this is for my aunt, the\r\nSignora Francatelli.\"\r\n\r\nDemetrius promised to attend to all the instructions which he had\r\nreceived; and Ibrahim Pasha took his leave of the brother and the\r\ncharming sister, the latter of whom conveyed to him the full extent of\r\nher gratitude for his kindness and condescension toward them in a few\r\nwords uttered in a subdued tone, but with all the eloquence of her fine\r\ndark eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not love my unknown protectress,\" murmured Ibrahim to himself, as\r\nhe sped rapidly back to his palace, \"I feel that Calanthe's eyes would\r\nmake an impression upon my heart.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he resumed his magnificent garb, on his return home, when a\r\nslave announced to him that his imperial majesty, the sultan, required\r\nhis immediate attendance at the seraglio, whither he was to repair in\r\nthe most private manner possible. A sudden misgiving darted through\r\nIbrahim's imagination. Could Solyman have repented of the step which he\r\nhad taken in thus suddenly elevating him to the pinnacle of power? Was\r\nhis viziership to last but a few short hours? had the secret influence,\r\nwhich had hitherto protected him, ceased?\r\n\r\nConsidering the times and the country in which he lived, these fears\r\nwere justifiable; and it was with a rapidly beating heart that the new\r\nminister hastened, attended only by a single slave, to the dwelling of\r\nhis imperial master. But when he was ushered into the presence of the\r\nsultan--his own slave remaining in the ante-room--his apprehensions were\r\ndissipated by the smiling countenance with which the monarch greeted\r\nhim. Having signaled his attendants to retire, Solyman the Magnificent\r\naddressed the grand vizier in the following manner:\r\n\r\n\"Thy great talents, thy zeal in our service, and the salvation which I\r\nowed to thee in the breach at Rhodes, have been instrumental, oh,\r\nIbrahim! in raising thee to thy present high state. But the bounties of\r\nthe sultan are without end, as the mercy of Allah is illimitable! Thou\r\nhast doubtless heard that among my numerous sisters, there is one of\r\nsuch unrivaled beauty--such peerless loveliness, that the world hath not\r\nseen her equal. Happy may the man deem himself on whom the fair Aischa\r\nshall be bestowed; and thou art that happy man, Ibrahim--and Aischa is\r\nthine.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier threw himself at the feet of his imperial master, and\r\nmurmured expressions of gratitude--but his heart sank within him--for he\r\nknew that in marrying the sultan's sister he should not be allowed the\r\nenjoyment of the Mussulman privilege of polygamy, and thus his hopes of\r\npossessing the beautiful unknown to whom he owed so much appeared to\r\nhover on the verge of annihilation. But might not that unknown lady and\r\nthe beauteous Aischa be one and the same person? The unknown was\r\nevidently the mistress of an influence almost illimitable; and was it\r\nnot natural to conceive that she, then, must be the sister of the\r\nsultan? Again, the sultan had many sisters; and the one who had exerted\r\nher interest for Ibrahim, might not be the Princess Aischa, who was now\r\npromised to him! All these conjectures and conflicting speculations\r\npassed through the mind of Ibrahim in far less time than we have taken\r\nto describe their nature; and he was cruelly the prey to mingled hope\r\nand alarm, when the sultan exclaimed, \"Rise, my Vizier Azem, and follow\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThe apostate obeyed with beating heart, and Solyman the Magnificent\r\nconducted him along several passages and corridors to a splendidly\r\nfurnished room, which Ibrahim immediately recognized as the very one in\r\nwhich he had been admitted, many months previously, to an interview with\r\nthe beauteous unknown. Yes--that was the apartment in which he had\r\nlistened to the eloquence of her soft, persuasive voice--it was there\r\nthat, intoxicated with passion, he had abjured the faith of a Christian\r\nand embraced the creed of the false Prophet Mohammed. And, reclining on\r\nthe very sofa where he had first seen her--but attended by a troop of\r\ncharming female slaves--was the fair unknown--his secret\r\nprotectress--more lovely, more bewitching, than she appeared when last\r\nthey met.\r\n\r\nAn arch smile played upon her lips, as she rose from the magnificent\r\ncushions--a smile which seemed to say, \"I have kept my word, I have\r\nraised thee to the highest dignity, save one in the Ottoman Empire--and\r\nI will now crown thine happiness by giving thee my hand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, so beauteous, so ravishingly lovely did she appear, as that\r\nsmile revealed teeth whiter than the Oriental pearls, which she wore,\r\nand as a slight flush on her damask cheek and the bright flashing of her\r\neyes betrayed the joy and triumph which filled her heart--so elegant and\r\ngraceful was her faultless form, which the gorgeous Ottoman garb so\r\nadmirably became, that Ibrahim forgot all his recent compunction--lost\r\nsight of home and friends--remembered not the awful apostasy of which he\r\nhad been guilty--but fell upon his knees in adoration of that charming\r\ncreature, while the sultan with a smile which showed that he was no\r\nstranger to the mysteries of the past, exclaimed in a benignant tone,\r\n\"Vizier Azem! receive the hand of my well-beloved sister Aischa!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT OF ARESTINO--THE PLOT THICKENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn we now to the fair city of flowers--to thee, delightful\r\nFlorence--vine crowned queen of Tuscany! The summer has come, and the\r\ngardens are brilliant with dyes and hues of infinite variety; the hills\r\nand the valleys are clothed in their brightest emerald garment--and the\r\nArno winds its peaceful way between banks blushing with choicest fruits\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nBut, though gay that July scene--though glorious in its splendor that\r\nunclouded summer sun, though gorgeous the balconies filled with flowers,\r\nand brilliant the parterres of Tuscan roses, yet gloomy was the\r\ncountenance and dark were the thoughts of the Count of Arestino, as he\r\npaced with agitated steps one of the splendid apartments of his palace.\r\nThe old man was actually endowed with a good, a generous, a kind and\r\nforgiving disposition; but the infidelity of his wife, the being on whom\r\nhe had so doted, and who was once his joy and his pride--that infidelity\r\nhad warped his best feelings, soured his temper, and aroused the dark\r\nspirit of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"She lives! she lives!\" he murmured to himself, pausing for a moment to\r\npress his feverish hand to his heated brow; \"she lives! and doubtless\r\nunder the protection of her paramour! But I shall know more presently.\r\nAntonio is faithful--he will not deceive me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the count resumed his agitated walk up and down the room. A few\r\nminutes elapsed, when the door opened slowly, and Antonio, whom the\r\nreader may remember to have been a valet in the service of the Riverola\r\nfamily, made his appearance.\r\n\r\nThe count hastened toward him, exclaiming: \"What news, Antonio?\r\nSpeak--hast thou learnt aught more of--of _her_?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" answered the valet, closing the door behind him, \"I have\r\nascertained everything. The individual who spoke darkly and mysteriously\r\nto me last evening, has within this hour made me acquainted with many\r\nstrange things.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the countess?--I mean the guilty, fallen creature who once bore my\r\nname?\" ejaculated the old nobleman, his voice trembling with impatience.\r\n\r\n\"There is no doubt, my lord, that her ladyship lives, and that she is\r\nstill in Florence,\" answered Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"The shameless woman,\" cried the Count of Arestino, his usually pale\r\nface becoming perfectly death-like through the violence of his inward\r\nemotions. \"But how know you all this?\" demanded his lordship, suddenly\r\nturning toward the dependent; \"who is your informant--and can he be\r\nrelied on? Remember I took thee into my service at thine own\r\nsolicitation--I have no guarantee for thy fidelity, and I am influential\r\nto punish as well as rich to reward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship has bound me to you by ties of gratitude,\" responded\r\nAntonio, \"for when discarded suddenly by the young Count of Riverola, I\r\nfound an asylum and employment in your lordship's palace. It is your\r\nlordship's bounty which has enabled me to give bread to my aged mother;\r\nand I should be a villain were I to deceive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you, Antonio,\" said the count: \"and now tell me how you are\r\nassured that the countess escaped from the conflagration and ruin of the\r\ninstitution to which my just vengeance had consigned her--how, too, you\r\nhave learnt that she is still in Florence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have ascertained, my lord, beyond all possibility of doubt,\" answered\r\nthe valet, \"that the assailants of the convent were a terrible horde of\r\nbanditti, at that time headed by Stephano Verrina, who has since\r\ndisappeared no one knows whither; that the Marquis of Orsini was one of\r\nthe leaders in the awful deed of sacrilege, and that her ladyship the\r\ncountess, and a young maiden named Flora Francatelli, were rescued by\r\nthe robbers from their cells in the establishment. These ladies and the\r\nmarquis quitted the stronghold of the banditti together, blindfolded and\r\nguided forth by that same Stephano Verrina whom I mentioned just now,\r\nLomellino (the present captain of the horde), and another bandit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is your informant? how learned you all this?\" demanded the\r\ncount, trembling with the excitement of painful reminiscences\r\nreawakened, and with the hope of speedy vengeance on the guilty pair,\r\nhis wife and the marquis.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said Antonio, \"pardon me if I remain silent; but I dare not\r\ncompromise the man----\"\r\n\r\n\"Antonio,\" exclaimed the count, wrathfully, \"you are deceiving me! Tell\r\nme who was your informant--I command you--hesitate not----\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord! my lord!\" cried the valet, \"is it not enough that I prove my\r\nassertions--that I----\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried the nobleman; \"I have seen so much duplicity where all\r\nappeared to be innocence--so much deceit where all wore the aspect of\r\nintegrity, that I can trust man no more. How know I for certain that all\r\nthis may not be some idle tale which you yourself have forged, to induce\r\nme to put confidence in you, to intrust you with gold to bribe your\r\npretended informant, but which will really remain in your own pocket?\r\nSpeak, Antonio--tell me all, or I shall listen to you no more, and your\r\nservitude in this mansion then ceases.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will speak frankly, my lord,\" replied the valet; \"but in the course\r\nyou may adopt----\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not for yourself, nor for your informant, Antonio,\" interrupted\r\nthe count, impatiently. \"Be ye both leagued with the banditti\r\nyourselves, or be ye allied to the fiends of hell,\" he added, with\r\nfiercer emphasis, \"I care not so long as I can render ye the instruments\r\nof my vengeance!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, my lord!\" exclaimed Antonio, delighted with this assurance; \"and\r\nnow I can speak fearlessly and frankly. My informant is that _other_\r\nbandit who accompanied Stephano Verrina and Lomellino when the countess,\r\nFlora, and the marquis were conducted blindfold from the robbers'\r\nstronghold. But while they were yet all inmates of that stronghold, this\r\nsame bandit, whose name is Venturo, overheard the marquis inform\r\nStephano Verrina that he intended to remain in Florence to obtain the\r\nliberation of a Jew who was imprisoned in the dungeons of the\r\ninquisition: and this Jew, Venturo also learnt by subsequent inquiry\r\nfrom Verrina, is a certain Isaachar ben Solomon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isaachar ben Solomon!\" ejaculated the count, the whole incident of the\r\ndiamonds returning with all its painful details to his mind. \"Oh! no\r\nwonder,\" he added, bitterly, \"that the marquis has so much kindness for\r\nhim! But, proceed--proceed, Antonio.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was about to inform your lordship,\" continued the valet, \"that\r\nVenturo, of whom I have spoken, happened the next day to overhear the\r\nmarquis inform the countess that he should be compelled to stay for that\r\npurpose in Florence; whereupon Flora Francatelli offered her ladyship a\r\nhome at her aunt's residence, whither she herself should return on her\r\nliberation from the stronghold. Then it was that the maiden mentioned to\r\nthe countess the name of her family, and when Venturo represented all\r\nthese facts to me just now, I at once knew who this same Flora\r\nFrancatelli is and where she dwells.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know where she dwells!\" cried the count, joyfully. \"Then, Giulia,\r\nthe false, the faithless, the perjured Giulia is in my power! Unless,\r\nindeed,\" he added, more slowly--\"unless she may have removed to another\r\nplace of abode----\"\r\n\r\n\"That, my lord, shall be speedily ascertained,\" said Antonio. \"I will\r\ninstruct my mother to call, on some pretext, at the cottage inhabited by\r\nDame Francatelli: and she will soon learn whether there be another\r\nfemale resident there besides the aunt and the niece Flora.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, Antonio,\" exclaimed the count. \"Let no unnecessary delay take\r\nplace. Here is gold--much gold, for thee to divide between thyself and\r\nthe bandit informant. See that thou art faithful to my interests, and\r\nthat sum shall prove but a small earnest of what thy reward will be.\"\r\n\r\nThe valet secured about his person the well-filled purse that was handed\r\nto him, and retired.\r\n\r\nThe Count of Arestino remained alone to brood over his plans of\r\nvengeance. It was horrible--horrible to behold that aged and venerable\r\nman, trembling as he was on the verge of eternity, now meditating\r\nschemes of dark and dire revenge. But his wrongs were great--wrongs\r\nwhich, though common enough in that voluptuous Italian clime, and\r\nespecially in that age and city of licentiousness and debauchery, were\r\nnot the less sure to be followed by a fearful retribution, where\r\nretribution was within the reach of him who was outraged.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" he chuckled fearfully to himself, as he now paced the room\r\nwith a lighter step--as if joy filled his heart; \"all those who have\r\ninjured me are within the reach of my vengeance. The Jew in the\r\ninquisition; the marquis open to a charge of diabolical sacrilege--and\r\nGiulia assuredly in Florence! I dealt too leniently with that Jew--I\r\nsent to pay for the redemption of jewels which were my own property! All\r\nmy life have I been a just--a humane--a merciful man; I will be so no\r\nmore. The world's doings are adverse to generosity and fair-dealing. In\r\nmy old age have I learnt this! Oh! the perfidy of women toward a\r\ndoting--a confiding--a fond heart, works strange alterations in the\r\nheart of the deceived one! I, who but a year--nay, six months ago--would\r\nnot harm the meanest reptile that crawls, now thirst for\r\nvengeance--vengeance,\" repeated the old man, in a shrieking, hysterical\r\ntone, \"upon those who have wronged me! I will exterminate them at one\r\nfell swoop--exterminate them all--all!\" And his voice rang screechingly\r\nand wildly through the lofty room of that splendid mansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the bank of the Arno, in a somewhat retired situation, stood a neat\r\ncottage in the midst of a little garden, surrounded by no formal pile of\r\nbricks to constitute a wall, but protected only by its own sweet hedge\r\nor fragrant shrubs and blooming plants. Over the portico of the humble\r\nbut comfortable tenement twined the honeysuckle and the clematis; and\r\nthe sides of the building were almost completely veiled by the vines\r\namidst the verdant foliage of which appeared large hunches of purple\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\nAt an open casement on the ground floor, an elderly female, very plainly\r\nbut very neatly attired, and wearing a placid smile and a good-natured\r\nexpression upon a countenance which had once been handsome, sat watching\r\nthe glorious spectacle of the setting sun. The orb of day went down in a\r\nflood of purple and gold, behind the western hills; and now the dame\r\nbegan suddenly to cast uneasy glances toward the path that led along the\r\nbank of the river.\r\n\r\nBut the maiden for whose return the good aunt felt anxious, was not far\r\ndistant; indeed Flora Francatelli, wearing a thick veil over her head,\r\nwas already proceeding homeward after a short ramble by the margin of\r\nthe stream, when the reverie in which she was plunged was interrupted by\r\nthe sounds of hasty footsteps behind. Ever fearful of treachery since\r\nthe terrible incident of her imprisonment in the Carmelite Convent, she\r\nredoubled her speed, blaming herself for having been beguiled by the\r\nbeauty of the evening to prolong her walk farther than she intended on\r\nsetting out--when the increasing haste of the footsteps behind her\r\nexcited the keenest alarms within her bosom--for she now felt convinced\r\nthat she was pursued.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was already in sight, and a hundred paces only separated her\r\nfrom its door, when a well-known voice--a voice which caused every fiber\r\nin her heart to thrill with surprise and joy--exclaimed: \"Flora! beloved\r\none; fly not! Oh! I could not be deceived in the symmetry of thy\r\nform--the graciousness of thy gait--I knew it was thou.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in another moment the maiden was clasped in the arms of Francisco,\r\nCount of Riverola. Impossible were it to describe the ecstatic bliss of\r\nthis meeting--a meeting so unexpected on either side: for a minute\r\nbefore, Flora had deemed the young nobleman to be far away, fighting in\r\nthe cause of the cross, while Francisco was proceeding to make inquiries\r\nat the cottage concerning his beloved, but with a heart that scarcely\r\ndared nourish a hope of her reappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my well-beloved Flora!\" exclaimed Francisco; \"and are we indeed\r\nthus blest, or is it a delusive dream? But tell me, sweet maiden, tell\r\nme whether thou hast ceased to think of one, from whose memory thine\r\nimage has never been absent since the date of thy sudden and mysterious\r\ndisappearance.\"\r\n\r\nFlora could not reply in words--her heart was too full for the utterance\r\nof her feelings; but as she raised the veil from her charming\r\ncountenance, the tears of joy which stood upon her long lashes, and the\r\nheavenly smile which played upon her lips, and the deep blushes which\r\noverspread her cheeks spoke far more eloquently of unaltered affection\r\nthan all the vows and pledges which might have flowed from the tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Thou lovest me--lovest me--lovest me still!\" exclaimed the enraptured\r\ncount, again clasping her in his arms, and now imprinting innumerable\r\nkisses on her lips, her cheeks, and her fair brow. Hasty explanations\r\nspeedily ensued, and Francisco now learnt for the first time the cause\r\nof Flora's disappearance--her incarceration in the convent--and the\r\nparticulars of her release.\r\n\r\n\"But who could have been the author of that outrage?\" exclaimed the\r\ncount, his cheeks flushing with indignation, and his hand instinctively\r\ngrasping his sword; \"whom could you, sweet maiden, have offended? what\r\nfiend thus vented his malignity on thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold, my lord!\" cried Flora, in a beseeching tone; \"perhaps you----\"\r\n\r\nAnd she checked herself abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Call me not '_my lord_,' dearest maiden,\" said the count; \"to thee I am\r\nFrancisco, as thou to me art Flora--my own beloved Flora! But wherefore\r\ndidst thou stop short thus? wherefore not conclude the sentence that was\r\nhalf uttered? Oh, Flora--a terrible suspicion strikes me! Speak--relieve\r\nme from the cruel suspicion under which I now labor; was it my\r\nsister--my much lamented sister, who did thee that foul wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not,\" replied Flora, weeping; \"but--alas! pardon me, dear\r\nFrancisco--if I suspect aught so bad of any one connected with thee--and\r\nyet Heaven knows how freely, how sincerely I forgive my enemy----\" Her\r\nvoice was lost in sobs; and her head drooped on her lover's breast.\r\n\r\n\"Weep not, dearest one!\" exclaimed Francisco. \"Let not our meeting be\r\nrendered mournful with tears. Thou knowest, perhaps, that Nisida\r\ndisappeared as suddenly and as mysteriously as thou didst; but could she\r\nalso have become the victim of the Carmelites? And did she, alas! perish\r\nin the ruins of the convent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am well assured that the Lady Nisida was not doomed to that fate,\"\r\nanswered Flora; \"for had she been consigned to the convent, as a\r\npunishment for some real offense, or on some groundless charge, she must\r\nhave passed the ordeal of the chamber of penitence, where I should have\r\nseen her. Yes, Francisco--I have heard of her mysterious disappearance,\r\nand I have shed many, many tears when I have thought of her, poor lady!\r\nalthough,\" added the maiden in a low and plaintive tone, \"I fear,\r\nFrancisco, that it was indeed she who doomed me to that monastic\r\ndungeon. Doubtless, her keen perception--far more keen than in those who\r\nare blessed with the faculties which were lost to her--enabled her to\r\npenetrate the secret of that affection with which you had honored me,\r\nand in which I felt so much happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confessed my love to Nisida,\" interrupted Francisco; \"but it was not\r\nuntil your disappearance I was driven to despair, Flora. I was mad with\r\ngrief, and I could not, neither did I, attempt to conceal my emotion. I\r\ntold Nisida all: and well--oh! well--do I recollect the reply which she\r\ngave me, giving fond assurance that my happiness would alone be\r\nconsulted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Was there no double meaning in that assurance?\" asked Flora,\r\ngently. \"The Lady Nisida knew well how inconsistent with your high\r\nrank--your proud fortunes--your great name, was that love which you bore\r\nfor a humble and obscure girl----\"\r\n\r\n\"A love which I shall not be ashamed to own in the sight of all\r\nFlorence,\" exclaimed Francisco in an impassioned tone. \"But if Nisida\r\nwere the cause of that cruel outrage on thee, my Flora, we will forgive\r\nher--for she could have acted only through conscientious, though most\r\nmistaken, motives. Mistaken, indeed! for never could I have known\r\nhappiness again hadst thou not been restored to me. It was to wean my\r\nmind from pondering on afflictions that goaded me to despair that I\r\nembarked in the cause of Christendom against the encroachments of Moslem\r\npower. Thinking that thou wast forever lost to me--that my sister also\r\nhad become the victim of some murderous hand,--harassed by doubts the\r\nmost cruel--an uncertainty the most agonizing,--I sought death on the\r\nwalls of Rhodes; but the destroying angel's arrow rebounded from my\r\ncorselet--his sword was broken against my shield!\r\n\r\n\"During my voyage back to Italy--after beholding the crescent planted on\r\nthe walls where the Christian standard had floated for so many, many\r\nyears--a storm overtook the ship; and yet the destroying angel gave me\r\nnot the death I courted. This evening I once more set foot in Florence.\r\nFrom my own mansion Nisida is still absent: and no tidings have been\r\nreceived of her. Alas! is she then lost to me forever? Without tarrying\r\neven to change my travel-soiled clothes, I set out to make inquiries\r\nconcerning another whom I love--and that other is thyself! Here, thanks\r\nto a merciful Heaven, my heart has not been doomed to experience a\r\nsecond and equally cruel disappointment; for I have found thee at last,\r\nmy Flora--and henceforth my arm shall protect thee from peril.\"\r\n\r\n\"How have I deserved so much kindness at thine hands?\" murmured the\r\nmaiden, again drooping her blushing head. \"And oh! what will you think,\r\nFrancisco--what will you say, when you learn that I was there--there in\r\nthat cottage--with my aunt--when you called the last time to inquire if\r\nany tidings had been received of me----\"\r\n\r\n\"You were there!\" exclaimed Francisco, starting back in surprise not\r\nunmingled with anger; \"you were there, Flora--and you knew that I was in\r\ndespair concerning thee--that I would have given worlds to have heard of\r\nthy safety,--I, who thought that some fiend in human shape had sent thee\r\nto an early grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Francisco: forgive me!\" cried Flora, bursting into tears;\r\n\"but it was not my fault! On the night following the one in which the\r\nbanditti stormed the convent, as I ere now detailed to your ears, I\r\nreturned home to my aunt. When the excitement of our meeting was past,\r\nand when we were alone together, I threw myself at her feet, confessed\r\nall that had passed between thee and me, and implored her advice.\r\n\r\n\"'Flora,' she said, while her tears fell upon me as I knelt, 'no\r\nhappiness will come to thee, my child, from this attachment which has\r\nalready plunged thee into so much misery. It is beyond all doubt certain\r\nthat the relations of the count were the authors of thy imprisonment;\r\nand their persecutions would only be renewed, were they to learn that\r\nthe count was made aware of your reappearance in Florence. For thy sake,\r\nthen, my child, I shall suffer the impression of thy continued absence\r\nand loss to remain on the minds of those who may inquire concerning\r\nthee; and should his lordship call here again, most especially to him\r\nshall I appear stricken with grief on account of thee. His passion, my\r\nchild, is one of boyhood--evanescent, though ardent while it endures. He\r\nwill soon forget thee; and when he shall have learnt to love another\r\nthere will no longer be any necessity for thee to live an existence of\r\nconcealment.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus spoke my aunt, dear Francisco, and I dared not gainsay her. When\r\nyou came the last time. I heard your voice; I listened from my chamber\r\ndoor to all you said to my aunt, and I longed to fly into your arms. You\r\nwent away and my heart was nearly broken. Some days afterward we learnt\r\nthe strange disappearance of the Lady Nisida and then knew that you must\r\nhave received a severe blow, for I was well aware how much you loved\r\nher. Two or three weeks elapsed, and then we heard that you were about\r\nto depart to the wars. Oh! how bitter were the tears that I shed, how\r\nfervent were the prayers that I offered up for your safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"And those prayers have been heard on high, beloved one, exclaimed\r\nFrancisco, who had listened with melting heart and returning tenderness\r\nto the narrative which the maiden told so simply but so sincerely, and\r\nin the most plaintive tones of her musical voice.\r\n\r\n\"Can you forgive me now?\" asked the blushing maiden, her swimming eyes\r\nbending on her lover glances eloquently expressive of hope.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to forgive, sweet girl,\" replied Francisco. \"Your aunt\r\nbehaved with a prudence which in justice I cannot condemn; and you acted\r\nwith an obedience and submission to your venerable relative which I\r\ncould not be arbitrary enough to blame. We have both endured much for\r\neach other, my Flora; but the days of our trials are passed; and your\r\ngood aunt will be convinced that in giving your young heart to me, you\r\nhave not confided in one who is undeserving of so much love. Let us\r\nhasten into her presence. But one question have I yet to ask you,\" he\r\nadded, suddenly recollecting an idea which had ere now made some\r\nimpression on his mind. \"You informed me how you were liberated from the\r\nconvent, and you mentioned the name of the Countess of Arestino, whom\r\ncircumstances had made your companion in that establishment, and to whom\r\nyour aunt gave an asylum. Know you not, dearest Flora, that fame reports\r\nnot well of that same Giulia of Arestino--and that a woman of tarnished\r\nreputation is no fitting associate for an innocent and artless maiden\r\nsuch as thou?\"\r\n\r\n\"During the period that the Lady of Arestino and myself were companions\r\nin captivity,\" responded Flora, with a frankness as amiable as it was\r\nconvincing, \"she never in the most distant manner alluded to her love\r\nfor the Marquis of Orsini. When the marquis appeared in the convent, in\r\ncompany with the robbers, I was far too much bewildered with the passing\r\nevents, to devote a thought to what might be the nature of their\r\nconnection; and even when I had more leisure for reflection, during the\r\nentire day which I passed in the stronghold of the banditti, I saw\r\nnaught in it save what I conceived to be the bond of close relationship.\r\nI offered her ladyship an asylum at the abode of my aunt, as I should\r\nhave given a home, under such circumstances, to the veriest wretch\r\ncrawling on the face of the earth. But in that cottage the countess and\r\nmyself have not continued in close companionship; for my aunt\r\naccidentally learnt that fame reported not well of the Lady of Arestino,\r\nand in a gentle manner she begged her to seek another home at her\r\nearliest leisure. The countess implored my venerable relative to permit\r\nher to retrain at the cottage, as her life would be in danger were she\r\nnot afforded a sure and safe asylum. Moved by her earnest entreaties, my\r\naunt assented; and the countess has almost constantly remained in her\r\nown chamber. Sometimes--but very rarely--she goes forth after dusk, and\r\nin a deep disguise; the marquis has not, however, visited the cottage\r\nsince my aunt made this discovery relative to the reputation of the Lady\r\nof Arestino.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, charming Flora, for that explanation!\" cried the young count.\r\n\"Let us now hasten to thine aunt; and in her presence will I renew to\r\nthee all the vows of unalterable and honorable affection which my heart\r\nsuggests, as a means of proving that I am worthy of thy love.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, hand-in-hand, that fine young noble and that beauteous, blushing\r\nmaiden proceeded to the cottage.\r\n\r\nTwo persons, concealed in an adjacent grove, had overheard every\r\nsyllable of the above conversation. These were the valet Antonio, and\r\nhis mother, Dame Margaretha, at whose dwelling, it will be recollected,\r\nthe unfortunate Agnes had so long resided, under the protection of the\r\nlate Count of Riverola.\r\n\r\n\"This is fortunate, mother!\" said Antonio, when Francisco and Flora had\r\nretired from the vicinity of the grove. \"You are spared the trouble of a\r\nvisit to the old Signora Francatelli; and I have learned sufficient to\r\nenable me to work out all my plans alike of aggrandizement and revenge.\r\nLet us retrace our way into the city; thou wilt return to thy home--and\r\nI shall hence straight to the Lord Count of Arestino.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEK PAGE--SONG OF THE GREEK PAGE--A REVELATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree months had now elapsed since Ibrahim-Pasha had risen to the\r\nexalted rank of grand vizier, and had married the sister of Solyman the\r\nMagnificent. The sultan daily became more attached to him; and he, on\r\nhis part, acquired influence over his imperial master. Vested with a\r\npower so nearly absolute that Solyman signed without ever perusing the\r\nhatti-sheriffs, or decrees, drawn up by Ibrahim,--and enjoying the\r\nconfidence of the divan, all the members of which were devoted to his\r\ninterests,--the renegade administered according to his own discretion,\r\nthe affairs of that mighty empire. Avaricious, and ever intent upon the\r\naggrandizement of his own fortunes, he accumulated vast treasures; but\r\nhe also maintained a household and lived in a style unequaled by any of\r\nhis predecessors in office. Having married a sister of the sultan, he\r\nwas not permitted a plurality of wives;--but he purchased the most\r\nbeauteous slaves for his harem, and plunged headlong into a vortex of\r\ndissipation and pleasure.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks he had manifested the most ardent and impassioned\r\nattachment toward Aischa, who, during that period, was happy in the\r\nbelief that she alone possessed his heart. But the customs of the East,\r\nas well as the duties of his office, kept them so much apart, that he\r\nhad no leisure to discover the graces of her mind, nor to appreciate all\r\nthe powers of her naturally fine, and indeed well-cultivated intellect;\r\nso that the beauty of her person constituted the only basis on which his\r\naffection was maintained. The fervor of such a love soon cooled with\r\nsatiety: and those female slaves whom he had at first procured as\r\nindispensable appendages to his rank and station, were not long in\r\nbecoming the sources of new pleasure and voluptuous enjoyment. Aischa\r\nbeheld his increasing indifference, and strove to bind him to her by\r\nrepresenting all she had done for him. He listened coldly at first; but\r\nwhen, on several occasions, the same remonstrances were repeated, he\r\nanswered angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Had it not been for my influence,\" she said to him one day, when the\r\ndispute had become more serious than preceding quarrels of the kind,\r\n\"you might still have been an humble secretary to a Christian noble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" replied the grand vizier; \"for at the very time when I first\r\nbeheld thee in the Bezestein, certain offers had been secretly conveyed\r\nto me from the reis-effendi.\"\r\n\r\n\"In whose service you would have lingered as a mere subordinate for\r\nlong, long years,\" returned Aischa. \"It was I who urged you on. Have I\r\nnot often assured you that your image dwelt in my memory after the\r\naccident which first led to our meeting--that one of my faithful women\r\nnoticed my thoughtful mood--and that when I confessed to her the truth,\r\nshe stated to me that, by a singular coincidence, her own brother was\r\nemployed by the reis-effendi as an agent to tempt you with the offers to\r\nwhich you have alluded? Then, inquiries which my slave instituted,\r\nbrought to my ears the flattering tidings that you also thought of me,\r\nand I resolved to grant you an interview. From that moment my influence\r\nhurried you on to power--and when you became the favorite of the mighty\r\nSolyman, I confessed to him that I had seen and that I loved you. His\r\nfraternal attachment to me is great--greater than to any other of his\r\nsisters, seeing that himself and I were born of the same mother, though\r\nat a long interval. Thus was it that my persuasion made him think higher\r\nand oftener of you than he would else have done--and now that you have\r\nattained the summit of glory and power, she who has helped to raise you\r\nis neglected and loved no longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cease these reproaches, Aischa,\" exclaimed Ibrahim, who had listened\r\nimpatiently to her long address, \"or I will give thee less of my company\r\nthan heretofore. See that the next time I visit thee my reception may be\r\nwith smiles instead of tears--with sweet words instead of reproaches.\"\r\nAnd in this cruel manner the heartless renegade quitted his beauteous\r\nwife, leaving her plunged in the most profound affliction.\r\n\r\nBut as Ibrahim traversed the corridors leading to his own apartments,\r\nhis heart smote him for the harshness and unfeeling nature of his\r\nconduct; and as one disagreeable idea, by disposing the spirits to\r\nmelancholy, usually arouses others that were previously slumbering in\r\nthe cells of the brain, all the turpitude of his apostasy was recalled\r\nwith new force to his mind.\r\n\r\nRepairing to a small but magnificently furnished saloon in a retired\r\npart of the palace, he dismissed the slaves who were waiting at the\r\ndoor, ordering them, however, to send into his presence a young Greek\r\npage who had recently entered his service. In a few minutes the youth\r\nmade his appearance, and stood in a respectful attitude near the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come and sit at my feet, Constantine,\" said the grand vizier, \"and thou\r\nshalt sing to me one of those airs of thy native Greece with which thou\r\nhast occasionally delighted mine ears. I know not how it is, boy--but\r\nthy presence pleases me, and thy voice soothes my soul, when oppressed\r\nwith the cares of my high office.\"\r\n\r\nJoy flashed from the bright black eyes of the young Greek page as he\r\nglided noiselessly over the thick carpet, but that emotion of pleasure\r\nwas instantly changed to one of deep deference.\r\n\r\n\"Proceed,\" said his master, \"and sing me that plaintive song which is\r\nsupposed to depict the woes of one of the unhappy sons of Greece.\"\r\n\r\n\"But may not its sentiments offend your highness?\" asked the page.\r\n\r\n\"It is but a song,\" responded Ibrahim. \"I give thee full permission to\r\nsing those verses, and I should be sorry were you to subdue aught of the\r\nimpassioned feelings which they are well calculated to excite within\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\nThe page turned his handsome countenance up toward the grand vizier, and\r\ncommenced in melodious, liquid tones, the following song--\r\n\r\n\r\n    SONG OF THE GREEK PAGE.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, are there not beings condemned from their birth,\r\n    To drag, without solace or hope o'er the earth,\r\n      The burden of grief and of sorrow?\r\n    Doomed wretches who know, while they tremblingly say,\r\n    'The star of my fate appears brighter to-day,'\r\n    That it is but a brief and a mocking ray,\r\n      To make darkness darker to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    \"And 'tis not to the vile and base alone\r\n    That unchanging grief and sorrow are known,\r\n      But as oft to the pure and guileless;\r\n    And he, from whose fervid and generous lip,\r\n    Gush words of the kindest fellowship,\r\n    Of the same pure fountain may not sip\r\n      In return, but it is sad and smileless!\r\n\r\n    \"Yes; such doomed mortals, alas! there be\r\n    And mine is that self-same destiny;\r\n      The fate of the lorn and lonely;\r\n    For e'en in my childhood's early day,\r\n    The comrades I sought would turn away;\r\n    And of all the band, from the sportive play\r\n      Was I thrust and excluded only.\r\n\r\n    \"When fifteen summers had passed o'er my head,\r\n    I stood on the battle-field strewn with the dead.\r\n      For the day of the Moslem's glory\r\n    Had made me an orphan child, and there\r\n    My sire was stretched; and his bosom bare\r\n    Showed a gaping wound; and the flowing hair\r\n      Of his head was damp and gory.\r\n\r\n    \"My sire was the chief of the patriot band,\r\n    That had fought and died for their native land,\r\n      When her rightful prince betrayed her;\r\n    On his kith and kin did the vengeance fall\r\n    Of the Mussulman foes--and each and all\r\n    Were swept from the old ancestral hall,\r\n      Save myself, by the fierce invader!\r\n\r\n    \"And I was spared from that blood-stained grave\r\n    To be dragged away as the Moslem's slave,\r\n      And bend to the foe victorious,--\r\n    But, O Greece! to thee does my memory turn\r\n    Its longing eyes--and my heart-strings yearn\r\n    To behold thee rise in thy might and spurn,\r\n      As of yore, thy yoke inglorious!\r\n\r\n    \"But oh! whither has Spartan courage fled?\r\n    And why, proud Athens! above thine head\r\n      Is the Mussulman crescent gleaming?\r\n    Have thine ancient memories no avail?\r\n    And art thou not fired at the legend tale\r\n    Which reminds thee how the whole world grew pale,\r\n      And recoiled from thy banners streaming?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, boy,\" exclaimed Ibrahim: then in a low tone, he murmured to\r\nhimself, \"The Christians have indeed much cause to anathematize the\r\nencroachments and tyranny of the Moslems.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause, during which the grand vizier was absorbed in\r\nprofound meditation, while the Greek page never once withdrew his eyes\r\nfrom the countenance of that high functionary.\r\n\r\n\"Boy,\" at length said Ibrahim, \"you appear attached to me. I have\r\nobserved many proofs of your devotion during the few months that you\r\nhave been in my service. Speak--is there aught that I can do to make you\r\nhappy? Have you relations or friends who need protection? If they be\r\npoor, I will relieve their necessities.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lips cannot express the gratitude which my heart feels toward your\r\nhighness,\" returned the page, \"but I have no friends in behalf of whom I\r\nmight supplicate the bounty of your highness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you yourself happy, Constantine?\" asked Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n\"Happy in being permitted to attend upon your highness,\" was the reply,\r\ndelivered in a soft and tremulous tone.\r\n\r\n\"But is it in my power to render you happier?\" demanded the grand\r\nvizier.\r\n\r\nConstantine hung down his head--reflected for a few moments, and then\r\nmurmured \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, by Heaven!\" exclaimed Ibrahim Pasha, \"thou hast only to name thy\r\nrequest, and it will be granted. I know not wherefore, but I am attached\r\nto thee much. I feel interested in thy welfare, and I would be rejoiced\r\nto minister to thy happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am already happier than I was--happier, because my lips have drunk in\r\nsuch words flowing from the lips of one who is exalted as highly as I am\r\ninsignificant and humble.\" said the page, in a voice tremulous with\r\nemotion, but sweetly musical. \"Yes, I am happier,\" he continued--\"and\r\nyet my soul is filled with the image of a dear, a well-beloved sister,\r\nwho pines in loneliness and solitude, ever dwelling on a hapless love\r\nwhich she has formed for one who knows not that he is so loved, and who\r\nperhaps may never--never know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thou hast a sister, Constantine?\" exclaimed the grand vizier. \"And\r\nis she as lovely as a sister of a youth so handsome as thou art ought to\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has been assured by those who have sought her hand, that she is\r\nindeed beautiful,\" answered Constantine. \"But of what avail are her\r\ncharms, since he whom she loves may never whisper in her ear the\r\ndelicious words, 'I love thee in return.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the object of her affections possess so obdurate a heart?\"\r\ninquired the grand vizier, strangely interested in the discourse of his\r\nyouthful page.\r\n\r\n\"It is not that he scorns my sister's love,\" replied Constantine; \"but\r\nit is that he knows not of its existence. It is true that he has seen\r\nher once--yet 'twere probable that he remembers not there is such a\r\nbeing in the world. Thus came it to pass, my lord--an officer, holding a\r\nhigh rank in the service of his imperial majesty, the great Solyman, had\r\noccasion to visit a humble dwelling wherein my sister resided. She--poor\r\nsilly maiden! was so struck by his almost god-like beauty--so dazzled by\r\nhis fascinating address--so enchanted by the sound of his voice, that\r\nshe surrendered up her heart suddenly and secretly--surrendered it\r\nbeyond all power of reclamation. Since then she has never ceased to\r\nponder upon this fatal passion--this unhappy love; she has nursed his\r\nimage in her mind, until her reason has rocked with the wild thoughts,\r\nthe ardent hopes, the emotions of despair--all the conflicting\r\nsentiments of feeling, in a word, which so ardent and so strange a love\r\nmust naturally engender. Enthusiastic, yet tender; fervent, yet melting\r\nin her soul; and while she does not attempt to close her eyes to the\r\nconviction that she is cherishing a passion which is preying upon her\r\nvery vitals, she nevertheless clings to it as a martyr to the stake! Oh!\r\nmy lord, canst thou marvel if I feel deeply for my unhappy sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore doth she remain thus unhappy?\" demanded Ibrahim-Pasha.\r\n\"Surely there are means of conveying to the object of her attachment an\r\nintimation how deeply he is beloved? and he must be something more than\r\nhuman,\" he added, in an impassioned tone, \"if he can remain obdurate to\r\nthe tears and sighs of a beauteous creature, such as thy sister\r\ndoubtless is.\"\r\n\r\n\"And were he to spurn her from him--oh! your highness, it would kill\r\nher!\" said the page, fixing his large, eloquent eyes upon the\r\ncountenance of the grand vizier. \"Consider his exalted rank and her\r\nhumble position----\"\r\n\r\n\"Doth she aspire to become his wife?\" asked Ibrahim.\r\n\r\n\"She would be contented to serve him as his veriest slave,\" responded\r\nConstantine, now strangely excited, \"were he but to look kindly upon\r\nher: she would deem herself blest in receiving a smile from his lips, so\r\nlong as it was bestowed as a reward for all the tender love she bears\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is this man that is so fortunate as to have excited so profound an\r\ninterest in the heart of one so beautiful?\" demanded the grand vizier.\r\n\"Name him to me--I will order him to appear before me--and, for thy\r\nsake, I will become an eloquent pleader on behalf of thy sister.\"\r\n\r\nWords cannot express the joy which flashed from the eyes of the page,\r\nand animated his handsome though softly feminine countenance, as,\r\ncasting himself on his knees at the feet of Ibrahim Pasha, he murmured,\r\n\"Great lord, that man whom my sister loves, and for whom she would lay\r\ndown her life, is thyself!\"\r\n\r\nIbrahim was for some minutes too much overcome by astonishment to offer\r\nan observation--to utter a word; while the page remained kneeling at his\r\nfeet. Then suddenly it flashed to the mind of the grand vizier that the\r\nonly humble abode which he had entered since he had become an officer\r\nholding a high rank in the service of Solyman, was that of his Greek\r\nemissary, Demetrius; and it now occurred to him, that there was a\r\nstriking likeness between the young page and the beautiful Calanthe:\r\nwhom he had seen on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Constantine,\" he said, at length, \"art thou, then, the brother of that\r\nDemetrius whom I dispatched some three months ago to Florence?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, my lord--and 'tis our sister Calanthe of whom I have spoken,\" was\r\nthe reply. \"Oh! pardon my arrogance--my presumption, great vizier!\" he\r\ncontinued, suddenly rising from his kneeling position, and now standing\r\nwith his arms meekly folded across his breast--\"pardon the arrogance,\r\nthe insolence of my conduct,\" he exclaimed; \"but it was for the sake of\r\nmy sister that I sought service in the household of your highness. I\r\nthought that if I could succeed in gaining your notice--if in any way I\r\ncould obtain such favor in your eyes as to be admitted to speak with one\r\nso highly raised above me as thou art, I fancied that some opportunity\r\nwould enable me to make those representations which have issued from my\r\nlips this day. How patiently I have waited that occasion, Heaven knows!\r\nhow ardent have been my hopes of success, when from time to time your\r\nhighness singled me out from amongst the numerous free pages of your\r\nprincely household to attend upon your privacy--how ardent, I say, these\r\nhopes have been, your highness may possibly divine. And now, my lord,\r\nthat I _have_ succeeded in gaining your attention and pouring this\r\nsecret into your ears, I will away to Calanthe and impart all the\r\nhappiness that is in store for her. Though the flowers may hold up their\r\nheads high in the light of the glorious sun, yet she shall hold hers\r\nhigher in the favor of your smile. Generous master,\" he added, suddenly\r\nsinking his voice to a lower tone and reassuming the deferential air\r\nwhich he had partially lost in the excitement of speaking, \"permit me\r\nnow to depart.\"\r\n\r\n\"This evening, Constantine,\" said the grand vizier, fixing his dark eyes\r\nsignificantly upon the page, \"let your sister enter the harem by the\r\nprivate door in the garden. Here is a key; I will give the necessary\r\ninstructions to the female slaves to welcome her.\"\r\n\r\nConstantine received the key, made a low obeisance, and withdrew,\r\nleaving the grand vizier to feast his voluptuous imagination with\r\ndelicious thoughts of the beauteous Calanthe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SULTANA VALIDA--THE THREE BLACK SLAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Princess Aischa, the now neglected wife of the grand\r\nvizier, had repaired to the imperial seraglio to obtain an interview\r\nwith her brother, Solyman the Magnificent. The sultan, as the reader has\r\nalready learnt, was deeply attached to Aischa. Their mother, the\r\nsultana, or empress mother, who was still alive, occupied apartments in\r\nthe seraglio. Her children entertained the greatest respect for her: and\r\nher influence over the sultan, who possessed an excellent heart, though\r\nhis sway was not altogether unstained by cruelties, was known to be\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore to her mother and her brother that the beautiful Aischa\r\nproceeded; and when she was alone with them in the Valida's apartment,\r\nand removed her veil, they immediately noticed that she had been\r\nweeping. Upon being questioned relative to the cause of her sorrow, she\r\nburst into an agony of tears, and was for some time unable to reply. At\r\nlength, half regretting that she had taken the present step, Aischa\r\nslowly revealed her various causes of complaint against the grand\r\nvizier.\r\n\r\n\"By Allah!\" exclaimed the sultan, \"the ungrateful Ibrahim shall not thus\r\nspurn and neglect the costly gift which I, his master, condescended to\r\nbestow upon him! What! when the Shah of Persia, the Khan of the Tartars,\r\nand the Prince of Karamania all sought thine hand, and dispatched\r\nembassadors laden with rich gifts to our court to demand thee in\r\nmarriage, did I not send them back with cold words of denial to their\r\nsovereigns? And was it to bestow thee, my sister, on this ungrateful\r\nboy, who was so late naught save a dog of a Christian, ready to eat the\r\ndirt under our imperial feet,--was it to bestow thee on such an one as\r\nhe, that I refused the offers of the Persian Shah! By the tomb of the\r\nprophet! this indignity shall cease!\"\r\n\r\n\"Restrain your wrath, my son,\" said the Sultana Valida. \"Ibrahim must\r\nnot be openly disgraced: the effects of his punishment would redound on\r\nour beloved Aischa. No--rather intrust this affair to me; and fear not\r\nthat I shall fail in compelling this haughty pasha to return to the arms\r\nof his wife--ay, and implore her pardon for his late neglect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! dearest mother, if thou canst accomplish this,\" exclaimed Aischa,\r\nher countenance becoming animated with joy and her heart palpitating\r\nwith hope, \"thou wouldst render me happy indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trust to me, daughter,\" replied the Sultana Valida. \"In the meantime\r\nseek not to learn my intentions; but, on thy return home, send me by\r\nsome trusty slave thy pass-key to the harem. And thou, my son, wilt lend\r\nme thine imperial signet-ring for twelve hours!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" said the sultan, as he drew the jewel from his finger, \"that\r\nhe who wears that ring possesses a talisman of immense power--a sign\r\nwhich none to whom it is shown dares disobey; remember this, my mother,\r\nand use it with caution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, my dearly beloved son,\" answered the Sultana Valida,\r\nconcealing the ring in her bosom. \"And now, Aischa, do you return to the\r\npalace of your haughty husband, who ere twelve hours be passed, shall\r\nsue for pardon at thy feet.\"\r\n\r\nThe sultan and Aischa both knew that their mother was a woman of\r\npowerful intellect and determined character; and they sought not to\r\npenetrate into the secret of her intentions.\r\n\r\nSolyman withdrew to preside at a meeting of the divan; and Aischa\r\nreturned to the palace of the grand vizier, attended by the slaves who\r\nhad waited for her in an anteroom leading to her mother's apartments.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the afternoon, and the time for evening prayer had\r\narrived ere the Sultana Valida received the pass-key to Ibrahim Pasha's\r\nharem. But the moment it was conveyed to her, she summoned to her\r\npresence three black slaves, belonging to the corps of the bostanjis, or\r\ngardeners, who also served as executioners, when a person of rank was to\r\nbe subjected to the process of bowstring, or when any dark deed was to\r\nbe accomplished in silence and with caution. Terrible appendages to the\r\nhousehold of Ottoman sultans were the black slaves belonging to that\r\ncorps--like snakes, they insinuated themselves, noiselessly and\r\nominously into the presence of their victims, and it were as vain to\r\npreach peace to the warring elements which God alone can control, as to\r\nimplore mercy at the hands of those remorseless Ethiopians!\r\n\r\nTo the three black slaves did the Sultana Valida issue her commands; and\r\nto the eldest she intrusted Solyman's signet-ring and the pass-key which\r\nAischa had sent her. The slaves bowed three times to the empress\r\nmother--laid their hands on their heads to imply that they would deserve\r\ndecapitation if they neglected the orders they had received--and then\r\nwithdrew. There was something terribly sinister in their appearance, as\r\nthey retired noiselessly but rapidly through the long, silent and\r\ndarkened corridors of the imperial harem.\r\n\r\nIt was night--and the moon shone softly and sweetly upon the mighty city\r\nof Constantinople, tipping each of its thousand spires and pinnacles as\r\nwith a star.\r\n\r\nIbrahim Pasha, having disposed of the business of the day, and now with\r\nhis imagination full of the beautiful Calanthe, hastened to the\r\nanteroom, or principal apartment of the harem.\r\n\r\nThe harem, occupying one complete wing of the vizier's palace, consisted\r\nof three stories. On the ground floor were the apartments of the\r\nPrincess Aischa and her numerous female dependents. These opened from a\r\nspacious marble hall; and at the folding-doors leading into them, were\r\nstationed two black dwarfs, who were deaf and dumb. Their presence was\r\nnot in any way derogatory to the character of Aischa, but actually\r\ndenoted the superior rank of the lady who occupied those apartments in\r\nrespect to the numerous females who tenanted the rooms above. As she was\r\nthe sister of the sultan, Ibrahim dared not appear in her presence\r\nwithout obtaining her previous assent through the medium of one of the\r\nmutes, who were remarkably keen in understanding and conveying\r\nintelligence by means of signs. A grand marble staircase led from the\r\nhall to the two floors containing the apartments of the ladies of the\r\nharem; and thus, though Aischa dwelt in the same wing as those females,\r\nher own abode was as distinct from theirs as if she were the tenant of a\r\nseparate house altogether.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor there was a large and magnificently furnished room in\r\nwhich the ladies of the harem were accustomed to assemble when they\r\nchose to quit the solitude of their own chambers for the enjoyment of\r\neach other's society. The ceiling of the anteroom; as this immense\r\napartment was called, was gilt entirely over; it was supported by twenty\r\nslender columns of crystal; and the splendid chandeliers which were\r\nsuspended to it, diffused a soft and mellow light, producing the most\r\nstriking effects on that mass of gilding, those reflecting columns, and\r\nthe wainscoted walls inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and with ivory of\r\ndifferent colors. A Persian carpet three inches thick was spread upon\r\nthe floor. Along two opposite sides ran continuous sofas, supported by\r\nlow, white marble pillars, and covered with purple figured velvet\r\nfringed with gold. In the middle of this gorgeous apartment was a large\r\ntable, shaped like a crescent, and spread with all kinds of preserved\r\nfruits, confectionery, cakes, and delicious beverages of a non-alcoholic\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe room was crowded with beauteous women when the presence of Ibrahim\r\nwas announced by a slave. There were the fair-complexioned daughters of\r\nGeorgia--the cold, reserved, but lovely Circassians--the warm and\r\nimpassioned Persians--the voluptuous Wallachians--the timid Tartars--the\r\ndusky Indians--the talkative Turkish ladies--beauties, too, of Italy,\r\nSpain, and Portugal--indeed, specimens of female perfection from many,\r\nmany nations. Their various styles of beauty, and their characteristic\r\nnational dresses, formed a scene truly delightful to gaze upon: but the\r\ngrand vizier noticed none of the countenances so anxiously turned toward\r\nhim to mark on which his eyes would settle in preference; and the ladies\r\nnoiselessly withdrew, leaving their master alone with the slave in the\r\nanteroom.\r\n\r\nIbrahim threw himself on a sofa, and gave some hasty instructions to the\r\nslave, who immediately retired. In about a quarter of an hour he came\r\nback, conducting into the anteroom a lady veiled from head to foot. The\r\nslave then withdrew altogether; and Ibrahim approached the lady, saying,\r\n\"Calanthe--beauteous Calanthe! welcome to my palace.\"\r\n\r\nShe removed her veil; and Ibrahim fixed his eager eyes upon the\r\ncountenance thus disclosed to him; but he was immediately struck by the\r\nmarvelous resemblance existing between his page Constantine, and the\r\ncharming Calanthe. It will be remembered that when he called, in a mean\r\ndisguise, at the abode of Demetrius, he saw Calanthe for the first time,\r\nand only for a short period; and though he was even then struck by her\r\nbeauty, yet the impression it made was but momentary: and he had so far\r\nforgotten Calanthe as never to behold in Constantine the least\r\nresemblance to any one whom he had seen before.\r\n\r\nBut now that Calanthe's countenance burst upon him in all the glory of\r\nits superb Greek beauty, that resemblance struck him with all the force\r\nof a new idea; and he was about to express his astonishment that so\r\nwondrous a likeness should subsist between brother and sister, when the\r\nmaiden sunk at his feet, exclaiming, \"Pardon me, great vizier; but\r\nConstantine and Calanthe are one and the same thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Methought the brother pleaded with marvelous eloquence on behalf of his\r\nsister,\" said Ibrahim, with a smile; and raising Calanthe from her\r\nsuppliant posture, he led her to a seat, gazing on her the while with\r\neyes expressive of intense passion.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness,\" observed the maiden, after a short pause, \"has heard\r\nfrom my own lips how profound is the attachment which I have dared to\r\nconceive for you--how great is the admiration which I entertain for the\r\nbrilliant powers of your intellect. To be with thee, great Ibrahim, will\r\nI abandon my country, friends--ay, and even creed, shouldst thou demand\r\nthat concession; for in thee--and in thee only--are all my hopes of\r\nhappiness now centered!\"\r\n\r\n\"And those hopes shall not be disappointed, dearest Calanthe!\" exclaimed\r\nIbrahim, clasping her in his arms. \"But a few minutes before you entered\r\nthis room a hundred women--the choicest flowers of all climes--were\r\ngathered here; and yet I value one smile on thy lips more than all the\r\ntender endearments that those purchased houris could bestow. For thy\r\nlove was unbought--it was a love that prompted thee to attach thyself to\r\nme in a menial capacity----\"\r\n\r\nThe impassioned language of the grand vizier was suddenly interrupted by\r\nthe opening of the door, and three black slaves glided into the\r\nanteroom--half crouching as they stole along--and fixing on the\r\nbeauteous Calanthe eyes, the dark pupils of which seemed to glare\r\nhorribly from the whites in which they were set.\r\n\r\n\"Dogs! what signifies this intrusion?\" exclaimed Ibrahim Pasha, starting\r\nfrom the sofa, and grasping the handle of his scimiter.\r\n\r\nThe chief the three slaves uttered not a word of reply, but exhibited\r\nthe imperial signet, and at the same time unrolled from the coil which\r\nhe had hitherto held in his hand a long green silken bowstring. At that\r\nominous spectacle Ibrahim fell back, his countenance becoming ashy pale,\r\nand his frame trembling with an icy shudder from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"Choose between this and her,\" whispered the slave, in a deep tone, as\r\nhe first glanced at the bowstring and then looked toward Calanthe, who\r\nknew that some terrible danger was impending, but was unable to divine\r\nwhere or when it was to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Allah!\" exclaimed the grand vizier; and throwing himself upon\r\nthe floor, he buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\nIn another moment Calanthe was seized and gagged, before even a word or\r\na scream could escape her lips; but Ibrahim heard the rustling of her\r\ndress as she unavailingly struggled with the monsters in whose power she\r\nwas. The selfish ingrate! he drew not his scimiter to defend her--he no\r\nlonger remembered all the tender love she bore him--but, appalled by the\r\nmenace of the bowstring, backed by the warrant of the sultan's signet\r\nring, he lay groveling on the rich Persian carpet, giving vent to his\r\nalarms by low and piteous groans.\r\n\r\nThen he heard the door once more close as softly as possible: he looked\r\nup--glared with wild anxiety around--and breathed more freely on finding\r\nhimself alone! For the Ethiopians had departed with their victim! Slowly\r\nrising from his supine posture, Ibrahim approached the table, filled a\r\ncrystal cup with sherbet to the brim, and drank the cooling beverage,\r\nwhich seemed to go hissing down his parched throat--so dreadful was the\r\nthirst which the horror of the scene just enacted had produced.\r\n\r\nThen the sickening as well as maddening conviction struck to his very\r\nsoul, that though the envied and almost worshiped vizier of a mighty\r\nempire--having authority of life and death over millions of human\r\nbeings, and able to dispose of the governments and patronage of huge\r\nprovinces and mighty cities--he was but a miserable, helpless slave in\r\nthe eyes of another greater still--an ephemeron whom the breath of\r\nSolyman the Magnificent could destroy! And overcome by this conviction,\r\nhe threw himself on the sofa, bursting into an agony of tears--tears of\r\nmingled rage and woe. Yes; the proud, the selfish, the haughty renegade\r\nwept as bitterly as ever even a poor, weak woman was known to weep!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow calm and beautiful lay the waters of the Golden Horn beneath the\r\nlight of that lovely moon which shone so chastely and so serenely above,\r\nas if pouring its argent luster upon a world where no evil passions were\r\nknown--no hearts were stained with crime--no iniquity of human imagining\r\nwas in the course of perpetration. But, ah! what sound is that which\r\nbreaks on the silence of the night! Is it the splash of oars? No--for\r\nthe two black slaves who guide yon boat which has shot out from the\r\nshore into the center of the gulf, are resting on the slight sculls--the\r\nboat itself, too, is now stationary--and not a ripple is stirred up by\r\nits grotesquely-shaped prow. What, then, was that sound?\r\n\r\n'Twas the voice of agony bursting from woman's throat; and the boat is\r\nabout to become the scene of a deed of horror, though one of\r\nfrequent--alas! too frequent--occurrence in that clime, and especially\r\non that gulf.\r\n\r\nThe gag has slipped from Calanthe's mouth; and a long loud scream of\r\nagonizing despair sweeps over the surface of the water--rending the calm\r\nand moonlit air--but dying away ere it can raise an echo on either\r\nshore. Strong are the arms and relentless is the black monster who has\r\nnow seized the unhappy Greek maiden in his ferocious grasp--while the\r\nluster of the pale orb of night streams on that countenance lately\r\nradiant with impassioned hope, but now convulsed with indescribable\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nAgain the scream bursts from the victim's lips; but its thrilling,\r\ncutting agony is interrupted by a sudden plunge--a splash--a gurgling\r\nand a rippling of the waters--and the corpse of the murdered Calanthe is\r\nborne toward the deeper and darker bosom of the Bosporus.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already dispersing the orient mists, when the chief of the\r\nthree black slaves once more stood in the presence of the grand vizier,\r\nwho had passed the night in the anteroom, alone, and a prey to the most\r\nlively mental tortures. So noiselessly and reptile-like did the hideous\r\nEthiopian steal into the apartment, that he was within a yard of the\r\ngrand vizier ere the latter was aware that the door had even opened.\r\nIbrahim started as if from a snake about to spring upon him--for the\r\nominous bowstring swung negligently from the slave's hand, and the\r\nimperial signet still glistened on his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Mighty pasha!\" spoke the Ethiopian in a low and cold tone; \"thus saith\r\nthe Sultana Valida: 'Cease to treat thy wife with neglect. Hasten to\r\nher--throw thyself at her feet--implore her pardon for the past--and\r\ngive her hope of affection for the future. Shouldst thou neglect this\r\nwarning, then every night will the rival whom thou preferrest to her be\r\ntorn from thine arms, and be devoted as food for the fishes. She whom\r\nthou didst so prefer this night that is passed sleeps in the dark green\r\nbed of the Bosporus. Take warning, pasha; for the bowstring may be used\r\nat last. Moreover, see that thou revealest not to the Princess Aischa\r\nthe incident of the night, nor the nature of the threats which send thee\r\nback repentant to her arms.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with these words, the slave glided hastily from the room, leaving\r\nthe grand vizier a prey to feelings of ineffable horror. His punishment\r\non earth had begun--and he knew it. What had his ambition gained? Though\r\nrich, invested with high rank, and surrounded by every luxury, he was\r\nmore wretched than the meanest slave who was accustomed to kiss the dust\r\nat his feet.\r\n\r\nBut, subduing the fearful agitation which oppressed him--composing his\r\nfeelings and his countenance as well as he was able, the proud and\r\nhaughty Ibrahim hastened to implore admittance to his wife's chamber,\r\nand when the boon was accorded, and he found himself in her presence, he\r\nbesought her pardon in a voice and with a manner expressive of the most\r\nhumiliating penitence. Thus, at the moment when thousands--perhaps\r\nmillions, were envying the bright fortunes and glorious destiny of\r\nIbrahim the Happy, as he was denominated--the dark and terrible\r\ndespotism of the Sultana Valida made him tremble for his life, and\r\ncompelled him to sue at Aischa's feet for pardon. And if, at the same\r\ninstant of his crushed spirit and wounded pride, there were a balm found\r\nto soothe the racking fibers of his heart, the anodyne consisted in the\r\ntender love which Aischa manifested toward him, and the touching\r\nsincerity with which she assured him of her complete forgiveness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturn we again to that Mediterranean island on which Fernand Wagner and\r\nthe beauteous Nisida espoused each other by solemn vows plighted in the\r\nface of Heaven, and where they have now resided for six long months. At\r\nfirst how happy--how supremely happy was Nisida, having tutored herself\r\nso far to forget the jarring interests of that world which lay beyond\r\nthe sea, as to abandon her soul without reservation to the delights of\r\nthe new existence on which she had entered. Enabled once more to use\r\nthat charming voice which God had given her, but which had remained\r\nhushed for so many years,--able also to listen to the words that fell\r\nfrom the lips of her lover, without being forced to subdue and crush the\r\nemotions which they excited,--and secure in the possession of him to\r\nwhom she was so madly devoted, and who manifested such endearing\r\ntenderness toward herself, Nisida indeed felt as if she were another\r\nbeing, or endowed with the lease of a new life.\r\n\r\nAt first, too, how much had Wagner and Nisida to say to each other,--how\r\nmany fond assurances to give--how many protestations of unalterable\r\naffection to make! For hours would they sit together upon the seashore,\r\nor on the bank of the limpid stream in the valley, and converse almost\r\nunceasingly, wearying not of each other's discourse, and sustaining the\r\ninterests and the enjoyment of that interchange of thoughts by flying\r\nfrom topic to topic just as their unshackled imagination suggested. But\r\nFernand never questioned Nisida concerning the motive which had induced\r\nher to feign dumbness and deafness for so many years; she had given him\r\nto understand that family reasons of the deepest importance, and\r\ninvolving dreadful mysteries from the contemplation of which she\r\nrecoiled with horror, had prompted so tremendous a self-martyrdom:--and\r\nhe loved her too well to outrage her feelings by urging her to touch\r\nmore than she might choose on that topic.\r\n\r\nCareful not to approach the vicinity of large trees, for fear of these\r\ndreadful tenants of the isle who might be said to divide its sovereignty\r\nwith them, the lovers--may we not venture to call them husband and\r\nwife?--would ramble hand-in-hand, along the stream's enchanting banks,\r\nin the calm hours of moonlight, which lent softer charms to the scene\r\nthan when the gorgeous sun was bathed all in gold. Or else they would\r\nwander on the sands to the musical murmur of the rippling sea,--their\r\narms clasping each other's neck--their eyes exchanging glances of\r\nfondness--hers of ardent passion, his of more melting tenderness. But\r\nthere was too much sensuality in the disposition of Nisida to render her\r\nlove for Wagner sufficient and powerful enough to insure permanent\r\ncontentment with her present lot.\r\n\r\nThe first time that the fatal eve drew near when he must exchange the\r\nshape of man for that of a horrid wolf, he had said to her, \"Beloved\r\nNisida, I remember that there are finer and different fruits on the\r\nother side of the island, beyond the range of mountains; and I should\r\nrejoice to obtain for thee a variety. Console thyself for a few hours\r\nduring mine absence; and on my return we shall experience renewed and\r\nincreased happiness, as if we were meeting again after a long\r\nseparation.\" Vainly did Nisida assure him that she reckoned not for a\r\nmore extensive variety of fruits than those which the nearest grove\r\nyielded, and that she would rather have his society than all the\r\nluxuries which his absence and return might bring; he overruled her\r\nremonstrances--and she at length permitted him to depart. Then he\r\ncrossed the mountains by means of the path which he had described when\r\nhe escaped from the torrent at the point where the tree stretched across\r\nthe stream, as described in the preceding chapter; and on the other side\r\nof the range of hills he fulfilled the dreadful destiny of the\r\nWehr-Wolf! On his return to Nisida--after an absence of nearly\r\ntwenty-four hours, for the time occupied in crossing and recrossing the\r\nmountains was considerable--he found her gloomy and pensive. His long\r\nabsence had vexed her: she in the secrecy of her own heart had felt a\r\ncraving for a change of scene--and she naturally suspected that it was\r\nto gratify a similar want that Fernand had undertaken the transmontane\r\njourney. She received his fruits coldly; and it was some time ere he\r\ncould succeed in winning her back to perfect good humor.\r\n\r\nThe next interval of a month glided away, the little incident which had\r\nfor a moment ruffled the harmony of their lives was forgotten--at least\r\nby Nisida;--and so devoted was Fernand in his attention, so tenderly\r\nsincere in his attachment toward her--and so joyful, too, was she in the\r\npossession of one whose masculine beauty was almost superhumanly great,\r\nthat those incipient cravings for change of scene--those nascent\r\nlongings for a return to the great and busy world, returned but seldom\r\nand were even then easily subdued in her breast.\r\n\r\nWhen the second fatal date after their union on the island approached,\r\nWagner was compelled to urge some new but necessarily trivial excuse for\r\nagain crossing the mountains; and Nisida's remonstrances were more\r\nauthoritative and earnest than on the previous occasion. Nevertheless he\r\nsucceeded in obtaining her consent: but during his absence of four or\r\nfive-and-twenty hours, the lady had ample leisure to ponder on home--the\r\nbusy world across the sea--and her well-beloved brother Francisco.\r\nFernand when he came back, found her gloomy and reserved; then, as he\r\nessayed to wean her from her dark thoughts, she responded petulantly and\r\neven reproachingly.\r\n\r\nThe ensuing month glided away as happily as the two former ones; and\r\nthough Fernand's attentions and manifestations of fondness increased, if\r\npossible, still Nisida would frequently sigh and look wistfully at the\r\nsea as if she would have joyed to behold a sail in the horizon. The\r\nthird time the fatal close of the month drew nigh, Wagner knew not how\r\nto act; but some petulance on the part of Nisida furnished him with an\r\nexcuse which his generous heart only had recourse to with the deepest,\r\nthe keenest anguish. Throwing back the harsh word at her whom he loved\r\nso devotedly, he exclaimed, \"Nisida, I leave thee for a few hours until\r\nthy good humor shall have returned;\" and without waiting for a reply he\r\ndarted toward the mountains. For some time the lady remained seated\r\ngloomily upon the sand; but as hour after hour passed away, and the sun\r\nwent down, and the moon gathered power to light the enchanting scene of\r\nlandscape and of sea, she grew uneasy and restless. Throughout that\r\nnight she wandered up and down on the sands, now weeping at the thought\r\nthat she herself had been unkind--then angry at the conviction that\r\nFernand was treating her more harshly than she deserved.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the sun was high in the heavens that Wagner reappeared;\r\nand though Nisida was in reality delighted to find all her wild alarms,\r\nin which the monstrous snakes of the isle entered largely, thus\r\ncompletely dissipated, yet she concealed the joy which she experienced\r\nin beholding his safe return, and received him with gloomy hauteur. Oh!\r\nhow her conduct went to Wagner's heart!--for he knew that, so long as\r\nthe direful necessity which had compelled his absence remained\r\nunexplained, Nisida was justified in attributing that absence to unkind\r\nfeelings and motives on his part. A thousand times that day was he on\r\nthe point of throwing himself at her feet and revealing all the details\r\nof that frightful destiny; but he dared not--oh! no, he dared not--and a\r\nprofound melancholy seized upon his soul. Nisida now relented, chiefly\r\nbecause she herself felt miserable by the contemplation of his\r\nunhappiness; and harmony was restored between them.\r\n\r\nBut during the fourth month of their union, the lady began to speak more\r\nfrequently and frankly of the weariness and monotony of their present\r\nexistence; and when Fernand essayed to console her, she responded by\r\ndeep-drawn sighs. His love was based on those enduring elements which\r\nwould have rendered him content to dwell forever with Nisida on that\r\nisland, which had no sameness for him so long as she was there to be his\r\ncompanion; but _her_ love subsisted rather sensually than mentally; and\r\nnow that her fierce and long-pent up desires had experienced\r\ngratification, she longed to return to the land of her birth, to embrace\r\nher brother Francisco; yes, even though she should be again compelled to\r\nsimulate the deaf and dumb. The close of the fourth month was at hand,\r\nand Wagner was at a loss how to act. New excuses for a fresh absence\r\nwere impossible; and it was with a heart full of anguish that he was\r\ncompelled to seize an opportunity in the afternoon of the last day of\r\nthe month, to steal away from Nisida and hasten across the mountains.\r\nOh! what would she think of his absence now?--an absence for which he\r\nhad not prepared her, and which was not on this occasion justified by\r\nany petulance or willfulness on her part? The idea was maddening, but\r\nthere was no alternative.\r\n\r\nIt was noon on the ensuing day when Fernand Wagner, pale and care-worn,\r\nagain sought that spot on the strand where the rudely constructed\r\ncottage stood; but Nisida was not within the hut. He roved along the\r\nshore to a considerable distance, and still beheld her not. Terrible\r\nalarms now oppressed him. Could she have done some desperate deed to rid\r\nherself of an existence whereof she was weary? or had some fatal\r\naccident befallen her. From the shore he hastened to the valley; and\r\nthere, seated by the side of the crystal stream, he beheld the object of\r\nhis search. He ran--he flew toward her; but she seemed not to observe\r\nhim; and when he caught a glimpse of her countenance, he shrank back in\r\ndismay--it was so pale, and yet so expressive of deep, concentrated\r\nrage!\r\n\r\nBut we cannot linger on this portion of our tale. Suffice it to say that\r\nWagner exerted all his eloquence, all his powers of persuasion to induce\r\nNisida to turn a kind glance upon him; and it was only when, goaded to\r\ndesperation by her stern silence and her implacable mien, he exclaimed,\r\n\"Since I am no longer worthy of even a look or a syllable, I will quit\r\nthee forever!\" It was only when these words conveyed to Nisida a\r\nfrightful menace of loneliness, that she relented and gradually suffered\r\nherself to be appeased. But vainly did she question him relative to the\r\ncause of his absence on this occasion; he offered a variety of excuses,\r\nand she believed none of them.\r\n\r\nThe month that followed was characterized by many quarrels and disputes;\r\nfor Nisida's soul acquired all the restlessness which had marked it ere\r\nshe was thrown on the island, but which solitude at first and then the\r\npossession of Wagner, had for a time so greatly subdued. Nevertheless,\r\nthere were still occasions when she would cling to Wagner with all the\r\nconfiding fondness of one who remembered how he had saved her life from\r\nthe hideous anaconda, and who looked up to him as her only joy and\r\nsolace in that clime, the beauty of which became painful with its\r\nmonotony--yes, she would cling to him as they roved along the sands\r\ntogether--she would gaze up into his countenance, and as she read\r\nassurances of the deepest affection in his fine dark eyes, she would\r\nexclaim rapturously, \"Oh! how handsome--how god-like art thou, my\r\nFernand! Pardon me--pardon me, that I should ever have nursed resentment\r\nagainst thee!\"\r\n\r\nIt was when she was in such a mood as this that he murmured in her ears,\r\n\"Nisida dearest, thou hast thy secret which I have never sought to\r\npenetrate. I also have my secret, beloved one, as I hinted to thee on\r\nthat day which united us in this island; and into that mystery of mine\r\nthou mayest not look. But at certain intervals I must absent myself from\r\nthee for a few hours, as I hitherto have done; and on my return, O\r\ndearest Nisida! let me not behold that glorious countenance of thine\r\nclouded with anger and with gloom!\"\r\n\r\nThen ere she could utter a word of reply, he sealed her lips with\r\nkisses--he pressed her fervently to his heart, and at that moment she\r\nthought he seemed so divinely handsome, and she felt so proud of\r\npossessing the love of a man invested with such superhuman beauty and\r\nsuch a splendid intellect, that she attempted not a remonstrance nor a\r\ncomplaint against what was but the preface to a fifth absence of\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. And when Fernand Wagner reappeared again, his\r\nNisida hastened to meet him as he descended from the mountains--those\r\nmountains which were crossed over by a surefooted and agile man with so\r\nmuch difficulty, and which he knew it would be impossible for him to\r\ntraverse during that mad career in which he was monthly doomed to whirl\r\nalong in his lupine shape--yes, she hurried to meet him--receiving him\r\nwith open arms--smiled tenderly upon him--and led him to the sea-shore,\r\nwhere she had spread the noonday meal in the most inviting manner.\r\n\r\nThe unwearied and unchanging nature of his love had touched her heart;\r\nand, during the long hours of his fifth absence, she had reasoned on the\r\nfolly of marring the sweet harmony which should prevail between the only\r\ntwo human tenants of that island. The afternoon passed more happily than\r\nmany and many a previous day had done; Nisida thought that Fernand had\r\nnever seemed so handsome, though somewhat pale, and he fancied that his\r\ncompanion had never appeared so magnificently beautiful as now, while\r\nshe lay half reclining in his arms, the rays of the setting sun faintly\r\nilluminating her aquiline countenance, and giving a glossy richness to\r\nthe luxuriant black hair which floated negligently over her naked\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nWhen the last beams of the orb of day died flickeringly in the far\r\nhorizon, the tender pair retired to their hut rejoicing in the serene\r\nand happy way in which the last few hours had glided over their\r\nheads--when a dark figure passed along the sand and stopped at a short\r\ndistance from the door of the rudely constructed tenement.\r\n\r\nAnd assuredly this was no mortal being--nor wore it now a mortal\r\nshape--but Satan--in all the horrors of his ugliness, though still\r\ninvested with that sublimity of mien which marked the mighty fallen\r\nangel--Satan, clothed in terrors ineffable, it was.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments he stood contemplating the hut wherein the sleepers\r\nlay; dread lightnings flushed from his eyes, and the forked electric\r\nfluid seemed to play round his haughty brow, while his fearful\r\ncountenance, the features of which no human pen may venture to describe,\r\nexpressed malignant hate, anticipated triumph, and tremendous scorn.\r\n\r\nThen, extending his right hand toward the hut, and speaking in that deep\r\nsonorous tone, which when heard by mortal ears, seemed to jar against\r\nthe very soul, he chanted the following incantation:--\r\n\r\n    \"Woman of wild and fierce desires!\r\n    Why languish thus the wonted fires\r\n    That arm'd thine heart and nerved thine hand\r\n    To do whate'er thy firmness planned?\r\n    Has maudlin love subdued thy soul,\r\n    Once so impatient of control?\r\n    Has amorous play enslaved the mind\r\n    Where erst no common chains confined?\r\n    Has tender dalliance power to kill\r\n    The wild, indomitable will?\r\n    No more must love thus paralyze\r\n    And crush thine iron energies;\r\n    No more must maudlin passion stay\r\n    Thy despot soul's remorseless sway;\r\n    Henceforth thy lips shall cease to smile\r\n    Upon the beauties of this Isle;\r\n    Henceforth thy mental glance shall roam,\r\n    O'er the Mediterranean foam,\r\n    Toward thy far-off Tuscan home!\r\n    Alarms for young Francisco's weal,\r\n    And doubts into thy breast steal;\r\n    While retrospection carries back\r\n    Thy memory o'er time's beaten track\r\n    And stops at that dread hour when thou\r\n    With burning eyes and flashing brow,\r\n    Call'd Heaven to hear the solemn vow\r\n    Dictated with the latest breath\r\n    Of the fond mother on the untimely bed of death.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the demon; and having chanted the incantation, full of menace\r\nand of deep design, he turned to depart.\r\n\r\nSleep was still upon the eyes of Fernand and Nisida as they lay in each\r\nother's arms--the island and the sea, too, were sleeping in the soft\r\nlight of the silver moon, and the countless stars which gemmed the vault\r\nof heaven,--when the dark figure passed along the sand, away from the\r\nrudely-constructed tenement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the sun rose again from the orient wave, Fernand repaired to the\r\ngrove, as was his wont, to gather fruits for the morning repast, while\r\nNisida bathed her fair form in the waters of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nBut there was a gloom upon that lady's brow, and there was a somber\r\nflashing in her large dark eyes which denoted an incipient conflict of\r\nemotions stirring within her breast.\r\n\r\nShe had retired to rest, as we have seen on the previous evening, with a\r\nheart glowing toward her beloved and handsome Fernand--she had fallen\r\nasleep with the tender sounds of his musical yet manly voice in her\r\nears, and the image of his beautiful countenance in her mind--but in the\r\nnight--she knew not at what hour--strange dreams began to oppress her,\r\nominous visions filled her with anxiety.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if some being, having right to reproach and power to taunt,\r\nwhispered to her as she slept, stern remonstrances against the idle,\r\nvoluptuous, and dreaming life she was leading, mocking her for passing\r\nher time in the maudlin delights of love, calling upon her to arouse her\r\nlatent energies and shake off that luxurious lethargy, teaching her to\r\nlook upon the island, beauteous though it were, as one vast prison in\r\nwhich she was confined, from whence there were, nevertheless, means of\r\nescape, raising up before her mental vision all the most alluring and\r\nbustling scenes of her own fair, native city of Florence, then bitterly\r\nreproaching her for having allowed her soul to be more wrapped up in the\r\nsociety of Fernand Wagner, than solicitous, as it was wont to be, for\r\nthe welfare of her brother Francisco, creating, too, wild doubts in her\r\nimagination as to whether circumstances might not, after all, have\r\nunited her brother and Flora Francatelli in the bonds of a union which\r\nfor many reasons she abhorred, and lastly thundering in her ears the\r\nterrific accusation that she was perjured to a solemn and an awful vow\r\npledged by her lips, on a dread occasion, and to the dictating voice of\r\nher dying mother.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke in the morning her brain appeared to be in confusion, but\r\nas her thoughts gradually settled themselves in the various cells of the\r\nseat of memory, the entire details of her long dream assumed the\r\nsemblance of a connected chain, even as we have just described them.\r\n\r\nFor these thoughts had arisen in the nature and order commanded by the\r\ndemon.\r\n\r\nFernand Wagner saw that the mind of his lovely companion, his charming\r\nbride, was ruffled; and, as he embraced her tenderly, he inquired the\r\ncause. His caresses for the moment soothed her, and induced her to\r\nstruggle against the ideas which oppressed: _for there are thoughts that\r\nSatan excites within us_, which we can wrestle with--ay, and conquer if\r\nwe will.\r\n\r\nFinding that Nisida became more composed, and that she treated her\r\nmournfulness and his agitation merely as the results of a disagreeable\r\ndream, Fernand rose, hastened to perform his own ablutions, and then\r\nrepaired to the adjacent grove, as above stated. But Nisida remained not\r\nlong in the Mediterranean's mighty bath; the moment Wagner had departed\r\nfrom her presence, thoughts which had recently passed in sad procession\r\nthrough her brain came back with renewed vigor; forcing themselves, as\r\nit were, upon her contemplation, because she offered but a feeble\r\nresistance to their returning invasion. And as she stood on the shore,\r\nhaving donned her scant clothing, and now combing out her long,\r\nluxuriant hair, to the silk richness of which the salt water had lent a\r\nmore glorious gloss--she became a prey to an increasing restlessness--an\r\naugmenting anxiety, a longing to quit the island, and an earnest desire\r\nto behold her brother Francisco once again, sentiments and cravings\r\nwhich gave to her countenance an expression of somber lowering and\r\nconcentrated passion, such as it was wont to exhibit in those days when\r\nher simulated deafness and dumbness forced her to subdue all the\r\nworkings of her excited soul, and compress her vermilion lips to check\r\nthe ebullition of that language which on those occasions struggled to\r\npour itself forth.\r\n\r\n\"O Italy! Italy!\" she exclaimed in an impassioned tone; \"shall I ever\r\nbehold thee again? O! my beloved native land, thou too, fair city, whose\r\nname is fraught with so many varied reminiscences for me, am I doomed\r\nnever to visit ye more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida--dearest Nisida!\" said Wagner, who had returned to her\r\nunperceived, and unheard--for his feet passed noiselessly over the sand;\r\n\"wherefore those passionate exclamations? why this anxious longing to\r\nrevisit the busy, bustling world? Are not the calm and serene delights\r\nof this island sufficient for our happiness? or art thou wearied of me\r\nwho love thee so tenderly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not wearied of thee, my Fernand!\" replied Nisida, \"nor do I fail\r\nto appreciate all thy tender affection toward me. But--I can conceal it\r\nfrom myself and from thee no longer--I am overcome with the monotony of\r\nthis isle. Unvaried sunshine during the day, unchanging calmness by\r\nnight, pall upon the soul. I crave variety, even the variety that would\r\nbe afforded by a magnificent storm, or the eruption of yon sleeping\r\nvolcano. My thoughts wander in spite of myself toward Italy; I think,\r\ntoo, of my brother--the young and inexperienced Francisco! Moreover,\r\nthere is in our mansion at Florence, a terrible mystery which prying\r\neyes may seek to penetrate,--a closet containing a fearful secret,\r\nwhich, if published to the world, would heap loathing execrations and\r\ndisgrace on the haughty name of Riverola! And now Francisco is the sole\r\nguardian of that mystery, which he himself knows not, or at least knew\r\nnot, when last we were together. But it requires a strong and energetic\r\nmind, like my own, to watch over that awful secret. And now, Fernand,\r\ndear Fernand, thou canst not blame me, thou wilt not reproach me, if I\r\nexperience an irresistible longing to return to my native land?\"\r\n\r\n\"And know you not, Nisida,\" said Wagner, in a tone of mingled\r\nmournfulness and reproach, \"that, even if there were any means for thee\r\nto return to Florence, I could not accompany thee? Dost thou not\r\nremember that I informed thee, that being doomed to death, I escaped\r\nfrom the power of the authorities--it matters not how; and that were I\r\nto set foot in Florence, it would be to return to my dungeon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! all this I remember well--too well!\" exclaimed Nisida. \"And think\r\nnot, my Fernand, that I feel no pang, when I lay bare to thee the state\r\nof my soul. But if it were possible for us to go to Italy, thou couldst\r\ndwell secretly and retiredly in some suburb of Florence, and we should\r\nbe together often--very often!\"\r\n\r\n\"No--Nisida,\" answered Wagner; \"that were impossible! Never more may I\r\nventure into that city--and if thou couldst even find the means to\r\nrevisit thy native clime, thither must thou go, and there must thou\r\ndwell _alone_!\"\r\n\r\nFor Wagner knew full well that were the lady to return to Florence, she\r\nwould hear of the frightful incidents which marked his trial and also\r\nthe day of his escape; and, though he had at first inclined to impart to\r\nher the terrible secret of his fate--yet subsequent and more calm\r\ndeliberation in his own mind had convinced him of the imprudence of\r\ngiving her love a shock by such a tremendous--such an appalling\r\nrevelation.\r\n\r\n\"Fernand,\" said Nisida, breaking silence after a long pause, during\r\nwhich she was wrapped in profound meditation, \"thy words go to my heart\r\nlike fiery arrows! O my handsome--my beautiful--my beloved Fernand, why\r\ndoes destiny thus persecute us? It is impossible for thee to return to\r\nFlorence:--it is equally impossible for me to renounce the first\r\nopportunity which Heaven may afford for me to repair thither! My God!\r\nwherefore do our fates tend in such opposite directions? to separate\r\nfrom thee were maddening: to abandon my brother Francisco--to desert the\r\ngrave and solemn interests which demand my presence at home, were to\r\nrender myself perjured to a vow which I breathed and which Heaven\r\nwitnessed, when I knelt long years ago at the death-bed of my mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"After all thou hast said, my beloved Nisida,\" exclaimed Fernand, in a\r\nvoice expressive of the deepest melancholy, \"I should be wrong--I should\r\nbe even criminal to listen only to the whispering of my own selfishness\r\nand retain thee here, did opportunity serve for thy departure. But on\r\nthis island shall I remain--perhaps forever! And if the time should come\r\nwhen you grew wearied of that bustling world across the sea, and thy\r\nmemory traveled to this lonely isle where thy Fernand was left behind\r\nthee,--haply thou wouldst embark to return hither and pass the remainder\r\nof thy days with one who can never cease to love thee!\"\r\n\r\nTears came into the eyes of Nisida--of her who so seldom, so very seldom\r\nwept;--and throwing herself into Wagner's arms, she exclaimed, \"God\r\ngrant that I may revisit my native land; and believe me, oh! believe me,\r\nwhen I declare that I would come back to thee the moment the interests\r\nof my brother no longer demanded my presence!\"\r\n\r\nThey embraced fondly, and then sat down upon the sand to partake of\r\ntheir morning repast.\r\n\r\nBut the thoughts of both were naturally intent upon the recent topic of\r\ntheir discourse; and their conversation, though each endeavored to force\r\nit into other channels, reverted to the subject which was now uppermost\r\nin their minds.\r\n\r\n\"What must my poor brother Francisco conjecture to be the cause of my\r\nprolonged, and to him mysterious absence?\" said Nisida, as her eyes were\r\ncast wistfully over the wide expanse of waters. \"Methinks that I have\r\nalready hinted to thee how the foolish passion which he had conceived\r\nfor a maiden of low degree and obscure birth, compelled me, in\r\naccordance with his nearest and best interest, to consign the object of\r\nhis boyish love to the convent of the Carmelites? Yes, and it was with\r\nsurprise and dismay incredible that I heard, ere I was torn away from\r\nFlorence by the villain Stephano, how that convent was sacked and\r\ndestroyed by unknown marauders----\"\r\n\r\n\"Full intelligence of which terrible sacrilege you communicated to me by\r\nsigns the second and last time you visited me in my dungeon,\" observed\r\nWagner.\r\n\r\n\"And I heard also, with increased fear,\" continued Nisida, \"that some of\r\nthe inmates of that convent had escaped; and, being unable, in\r\nconsequence of my simulated deafness and dumbness, to set on foot the\r\nnecessary inquiries, I could not learn whether Flora Francatelli was\r\namongst those who had so escaped the almost general ruin. O! if she\r\nshould have survived that fatal night--and if she should have again\r\nencountered my brother! Alas! thou perceivest, my Fernand, how necessary\r\nit is for me to quit the island on the first occasion which may serve\r\nfor that purpose!\"\r\n\r\n\"And wouldst thou, Nisida,\" asked Wagner reproachfully, \"place thyself\r\nas a barrier between the Count of Riverola and her whom he loves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" ejaculated Nisida, her countenance suddenly assuming a stern and\r\nimperious expression: \"for the most important interests are involved in\r\nthe marriage which he may contract. But enough of this, Fernand,\" she\r\nadded, relapsing into a more tender mood. \"And now tell me--canst thou\r\nblame me for the longing desire which has seized upon me--the ardent\r\ncraving to return to Florence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay--I do not blame thee, dearest Nisida!\" he exclaimed; \"but I pity\r\nthee--I feel for thee! Because,\" he continued, \"if I understand rightly,\r\nthou wilt be compelled to feign deafness and dumbness once more, in\r\norder to work out thy mysterious aims;--thou wilt be compelled to submit\r\nto that awful martyrdom--that terrible duplicity which thou wilt find so\r\npainful and difficult to resume, after the full enjoyment of the blessed\r\nfaculties of speech and hearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! such will be my duty!\" murmured Nisida; \"and oh! that destiny is\r\na sad one! But,\" she exclaimed, after a moment's pause, and as a\r\nreminiscence appeared suddenly to strike her, \"dost thou not think that\r\neven such a destiny as that becomes tolerable, when it is fulfilled as\r\nthe only means of carrying out the conditions of a vow breathed to a\r\nwell-beloved and dying mother? But wearisome--oh! crushingly tedious was\r\nthat mode of existence;--and the first bright day of real happiness\r\nwhich I enjoyed, was that when I first knew that thou didst love me! And\r\nagain, Fernand--oh! again was I supremely happy when, one evening--thou\r\nmay'st remember well,--it was the eve that my brother and the minion\r\nFlora exchanged tender words together in the room adjoining that where\r\nwe were seated--on that evening, Fernand, I besought by signs that thou\r\nwouldst breathe the words--_I love thee!_ and thou didst so--and I drank\r\nin those words as a person dying with thirst would imbibe pure spring\r\nwater placed to his lips!\"\r\n\r\nFernand pressed Nisida to his heart--for he saw, in spite of her anxiety\r\nto return to Italy, that she really loved him.\r\n\r\nBut though sensual and impassioned feelings led the beauteous Nisida\r\nthus frequently to melt into softness and tenderness when she\r\ncontemplated the wondrously handsome countenance of Fernand, yet from\r\nthis day forth her longing to return to Italy became more earnest--more\r\nirresistible; and she would compel him to sit by her side for hours\r\ntogether on the shore, while she eagerly watched for the appearance of a\r\nsail in the horizon. And Fernand, who divined her object, himself now\r\nlonged for the advent of a ship;--so sincere was his love for Nisida\r\nthat he was ready to make any sacrifice in order to promote her\r\nhappiness. Thus passed away the sixth month; and on the afternoon of the\r\nlast day thereof, when Wagner was about to observe to her that the time\r\nhad now arrived for him to pass the mountains once again, she said of\r\nher own accord, \"Fernand, my beloved, when next you visit the other side\r\nof the island, you would do well to raise some sign, or leave some\r\npermanent mark to show that there are inhabitants on this island. For a\r\nship might touch at that point--the sailors might seek the shore for\r\nwater, and they would then search to discover where those who raised the\r\nsignal-post are dwelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wish shall be fulfilled, dearest,\" answered Wagner; \"and without\r\ndelay will I seek the other side of the island.\"\r\n\r\nThey then embraced tenderly, and Fernand departed, once more to fulfill\r\nhis frightful doom! Nisida watched his receding form until it was lost\r\nin the groves intervening between the plains and the acclivities of the\r\nrange of mountains; and then she seated herself again on the sand,\r\nwondering of what nature her husband's secret could be, and why it\r\ncompelled him to absent himself occasionally from her. Though _he_ kept\r\nan accurate calculation of the lapse of time, and counted the passing\r\ndays with unvarying precision, yet she retained no such faithful\r\ncalendar in her memory, and had not observed that his absence always\r\noccurred on the last day of the month.\r\n\r\nThe hour of sunset was now rapidly approaching, and as Nisida was\r\nwrapped in thought, but with her eyes fixed wistfully upon the mighty\r\nbosom of the deep, a slight sound as of the rustling of garments fell\r\nupon her ears. She started up and glanced suddenly around. But how\r\nineffable was her astonishment--how great was her sudden joy, when she\r\nbeheld the figure of a man approaching her; for it instantly struck her\r\nthat the same ship which had conveyed him thither might bear her away\r\nfrom a scene which had latterly become insupportably monotonous.\r\n\r\nThe individual whose presence thus excited her astonishment and her\r\ndelight, was tall, thin, and attired rather in the German than in the\r\nItalian fashion: but, as he drew nearer, Nisida experienced indefinable\r\nemotions of alarm, and vague fears rushed to her soul--for the\r\nexpression of that being's countenance was such as to inspire no\r\npleasurable emotions. It was not that he was ugly;--no--his features\r\nwere well formed, and his eyes were of dazzling brilliancy. But their\r\nglances were penetrating and reptile-like,--glances beneath which those\r\nof ordinary mortals would have quailed; and his countenance was stamped\r\nwith a mingled sardonism and melancholy which rendered it painful to\r\ncontemplate.\r\n\r\nNisida attributed her feeling of uneasiness and embarrassment to the\r\nshame which she experienced at finding herself half-naked in the\r\npresence of a stranger, for so oppressive bad become the heat of the\r\nsummer, that her clothing was most scanty, and she had long ceased to\r\ndecorate her person with garlands and wreaths of fantastically woven\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, lady,\" said the demon, for he indeed it was; \"I am come to\r\ncounsel and solace, not to alarm thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"How knowest thou that I require counsel? and who art thou that talkest\r\nto me of solace?\" asked Nisida, her sentiment of shame yielding to one\r\nof boundless surprise at hearing herself thus addressed by a being who\r\nappeared to read the very inmost secrets of her soul.\r\n\r\n\"I am one who can penetrate into all the mysteries of the human heart,\"\r\nreturned the fiend, in his sonorous, deep-toned voice; \"and I can gather\r\nthy history from the expression of thy countenance, the attitude in\r\nwhich I first beheld thee, while thou wast still seated upon the strand,\r\nand the mingled emotions of surprise and joy with which thou didst mark\r\nmy presence. Is it, then, difficult to imagine that thou requirest\r\ncounsel to teach thee how to proceed so as to obtain thine emancipation\r\nfrom this isle? or would it be extraordinary if, moved by thy sorrow, I\r\noffered to befriend thee? And is it not ever the way with mortals--poor,\r\nweak, miserable beings that they are--to grow speedily dissatisfied with\r\ntheir lot? In the spirit of religion ye say that Heaven controls your\r\ndestinies according to its own wise purposes; and when all goes well\r\nwith ye, and you have your desires, ye pray and are thankful, because,\r\nforsooth,\" added the demon, with a smile of bitter scorn, \"it is so easy\r\nto pray when ye are contented and happy, and so easy to be thankful when\r\nye are pampered with all ye require. Here art thou, lady, on an island\r\nteeming with all the choicest fruits of the earth, and enjoying an\r\neternal summer, where all is pleasant to the view, and to whose silent\r\nshores the cares of the great world cannot come; and yet thou wouldst\r\nquit this calm retreat, and rush back into the vortex of evil passions,\r\nwarring interests, conflicting pursuits! But I will not weary thee with\r\nmy reflections; although it is my nature first to upbraid and taunt\r\nthose whom I intend to serve!\"\r\n\r\n\"And who art thou, strange being, that reasoneth morally with the smile\r\nof scorn upon thy lips?\" demanded Nisida, the vague alarms which had\r\npreviously influenced her reviving with additional power; \"who art thou,\r\nI say, that comest to reproach, and yet profferest thine aid?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter who I am,\" replied the fiend. \"Some day thou may'st know me\r\nbetter, if thou----\"\r\n\r\n\"But how camest thou hither? Where is the ship that brought thee--the\r\nboat that landed thee?\" demanded Nisida in a tone of feverish\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"No ship brought me hither--no boat set me on the shore,\" answered the\r\ndemon, fixing his eyes--those piercing eyes upon Nisida's countenance,\r\nas if to read the impression which this strange revelation made upon her\r\nsecret soul.\r\n\r\n\"Then who art thou?\" exclaimed the lady, a cold shudder passing over her\r\nentire frame, although she retreated not nor withdrew the glances which\r\nshe, through her wondrous strength of mind, was enabled to retain fixed\r\nupon the demon's countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Seek not to learn as yet who I am,\" said the fiend. \"Let it suffice for\r\nthee to know that I am something more than a mere mortal--a being gifted\r\nwith powers which, in the hands of such a one as thou, would throw the\r\nentire world into convulsions; for there is much in thee after my own\r\nheart, beauteous Nisida of Riverola.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! thou art even acquainted with my name,\" cried Nisida, again\r\nshuddering violently in spite of her powerful efforts to appear calm and\r\nfearless.\r\n\r\n\"I am acquainted with thy name, and with all that concerns thee and\r\nthine, Nisida,\" replied the fiend; \"ay,\" he added, with a malignant\r\nchuckle, \"even to the mystery of the closet in thy late father's\r\nchamber, and the contents of the terrible manuscript which taught thee\r\nsuch dreadful secrets! I know, too, all that thou hast done to serve\r\nthine aims--thy simulated deafness and dumbness--the assassination of\r\nAgnes--the imprisonment of Flora in the convent----\"\r\n\r\n\"Then art thou indeed some superhuman power,\" interrupted Nisida, in a\r\ntone of inexpressible alarm; \"and I dare hold no further converse with\r\nthee.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment--and thou wilt think differently!\" exclaimed the demon. \"But\r\nI will give thee an evidence of my power. Here, take this\r\ninstrument--'tis called a telescope--and use it for a single minute.\r\nGlance across the waters, and thou shalt behold a scene which will\r\ninterest thee somewhat, I trow.\"\r\n\r\nThe fiend handed her a telescope and directed her to apply it to her\r\neyes. She obeyed him, though reluctantly; but intense curiosity overcame\r\nher scruples, and, moreover, her extraordinary strength of mind aided\r\nher in supporting the presence of one whom she knew to be invested with\r\nsuperhuman powers--but of what nature she feared to guess. Nisida turned\r\ntoward the sea, and used the magic telescope as directed, while the\r\ndemon stood behind her, his countenance expressing a diabolical triumph,\r\nmingled with blighting scorn.\r\n\r\nBut ah! what does Nisida behold? The moment she applies the telescope to\r\nher eye, she is transported as it were to her own native city. She is in\r\nFlorence--yes, in the fair capital of Tuscany. Every familiar scene is\r\npresented to her again; and she once more views the busy crowds and the\r\nbustling haunts of men. She sweeps them all with a hurried glance; and\r\nthen her look settled upon a young couple walking together in a secluded\r\nplace on the banks of the Arno. But oh! how terribly flashed her\r\neyes--how changed with wrath and concentrated rage suddenly becomes her\r\ncountenance! For in that fond pair, wandering so lovingly together on\r\nthe Arno's margin she recognized her brother Francisco and the maiden\r\nFlora Francatelli!\r\n\r\n\"Thou hast seen enough!\" cried the demon, snatching the telescope from\r\nher hands. \"And now, more than ever,\" he added with a malignant smile of\r\ntriumph, \"dost thou long to revisit thy native land. It was to confirm\r\nthat longing that I showed thee the scene thou hast just witnessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And canst thou give me the means to return thither?\" demanded Nisida,\r\nalmost maddened by the spectacle that had met her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" exclaimed the fiend, \"and hear me patiently. I charge thee not\r\nto breathe to thy Fernand one word descriptive of this interview which\r\nthou hast had with me. Thou couldst simulate dumbness for ten long years\r\nor more, with a success which rendered thee great and glorious in my\r\neyes--for I love the hypocrite and the deceiver,\" he added with one of\r\nhis diabolical smiles; \"although I myself deceive them! Be dumb, then,\r\nin all that relates to my visit to thee here. But thou mayst so beset\r\nthy Fernand with earnest entreaties to give thee the means of departure\r\nfrom this island--for he can do so, if he have the will--that he shall\r\nbe unable to resist thy prayer--thy fears--thy anguish, real or feigned,\r\nwhichever that anguish may be. And should he not yield to thy\r\nintercessions, then assail him on another point. Tell him that thou wilt\r\nnever rest until thou shalt have discovered the cause of those\r\nperiodical visits which he makes to the other side of the\r\nmountains--threaten to accompany him the next time he goes thither. But\r\nI need not teach you how to be energetic nor eloquent. For thou art a\r\nwoman of iron mind and of persuasive tongue; and thy perseverance, as is\r\nthy will, is indomitable. Follow my counsel, then--and, though the\r\nfuture to a great extent be concealed from my view, yet I dare prophesy\r\nsuccess for thee! And now farewell, Nisida--farewell!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the demon retreated rapidly toward the forests, as if to seek the\r\nabode of those terrible serpents whose cunning was akin to his own.\r\n\r\nNisida was too much astonished by the nature of the counsel which his\r\ndeep sonorous voice had wafted to her ear, to be able to utter a word\r\nuntil his receding form was no longer visible, and then she exclaimed\r\nwildly; \"I have assuredly seen Satan face to face!\"\r\n\r\nAnd her blood ran cold in her veins. But a few moments were sufficient\r\nto enable that woman of wondrous energy to recover her presence of mind\r\nand collect her scattered thoughts; and she sat down on the sand to\r\nponder upon the strange incidents which had so terribly varied the\r\nmonotony of her existence. She thought, too, of the scene which she had\r\nbeholden on the banks of the Arno--her worst fears were confirmed; Flora\r\nhad escaped from the ruin of the Carmelite convent--was alive, was at\r\nliberty--and was with Francisco! Oh! how she now longed for the return\r\nof Fernand Wagner; but many hours must elapse--a night must pass--and\r\nthe orb of day which had by this time gone down, must gain the meridian\r\nonce more ere he would come back. And in the meantime, although she\r\nsuspected it not, he must fulfill the awful doom of a Wehr-Wolf, as the\r\nreader will find by the perusal of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was within a few minutes of sunset, as Fernand Wagner, having crossed\r\nthe mountains, hastened down that bituminous declivity constituting the\r\nscene of desolation which separated the range of volcano hills from the\r\ndelightful plains and verdant groves stretching to the sea-shore.\r\n\r\nA shudder passed over his frame as he beheld the solitary tree in which\r\nhe had seen the monstrous snake playing and gamboling, on the morning\r\nwhen he was thrown upon this Mediterranean isle.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed aloud, as he sped onward, \"what happiness and also\r\nwhat misery have I known in this clime. But, doomed and fated being that\r\nI am, such is my destiny; and so must I be, here or elsewhere, in\r\nwhichever land I may visit, in whatever part of the earth I may abide.\r\nOh! merciful Heaven, can no prayer, no self-mortification, remove the\r\nban--the curse--from my devoted head?\r\n\r\n\"Oh! just Heaven,\" he exclaimed, stretching forth his arms toward the\r\nsky, and with ineffable anguish depicted on his upturned countenance;\r\n\"spare me! Have I not been punished enough! Oh! take away from me this\r\nappalling doom--let me become old, wrinkled, forlorn, and poor once\r\nmore,--let me return to my humble cot in the Black Forest, or let me\r\ndie. Almighty power! if thou wilt--but spare me--spare me now!\r\nWretch--wretch that I was to be dazzled by the specious promises, O\r\nFaust! But I am justly punished--thy vengeance, O Heaven, is well\r\ndeserved--sinner, sinner that I am!\"\r\n\r\nThose were the last human sounds he uttered for several hours; for,\r\nscarcely had they escaped his lips, when the horrible change began, and\r\nin a few moments a wild yell rent the air, and a monstrous wolf sprung\r\nfrom the spot where Wagner had fallen down in such agonizing writhings.\r\n\r\nAway--away went the ferocious animal heading toward the sea--careering,\r\nthundering on, as if intent on plunging into the silent depths, and\r\nthere ending its course in a watery grave.\r\n\r\nBut no: death yawns not for the Wehr-Wolf! Scarcely have its feet\r\ntouched the verge of the water, when the monster wheels round and\r\ncontinues its whirlwind way without for an instant relaxing one tittle\r\nof its speed. Away--away, through the fruit-bearing groves, clearing for\r\nitself a path of ruin and havoc,--scattering the gems of the trees, and\r\nbreaking down the richly-laden vines; away--away flies the monster,\r\nhideous howls bursting from its foaming mouth. The birds scream and\r\nwhistle wildly, as startled from their usual tranquil retreats, they\r\nspread their gay and gaudy plumage, and go with gushing sound through\r\nthe evening air. He reaches the bank of a stream, and bounds along its\r\npleasant margin, trampling to death noble swans which vainly seek to\r\nevade the fury of the rushing monster.\r\n\r\nAway--away toward the forest hurries the Wehr-Wolf--impelled, lashed on\r\nby an invincible scourge, and filling the woods with its appalling\r\nyells--while its mouth scatters foam like thick flakes of snow. Hark,\r\nthere is an ominous rustling in one of the trees of the forest; and the\r\nmonster seems to instinctively know the danger which menaces it. But\r\nstill its course is not changed;--it seems not to exercise its own will\r\nin shaping its course. Down the tremendous snake flings itself from the\r\ntree--and in an instant its hideous coils are wound round the foaming,\r\nsteaming, palpitating body of the wolf. The air is rent with the yell of\r\nagony that bursts from the throat of the horrified monster as it tumbles\r\nover and over, as if it had run to the length of a tether--for the snake\r\nclings with its tail to the bough from which it has darted down. But the\r\nyielding of the wolf is only momentary; up--up it springs again--and\r\naway,--away it careers, more madly, more desperately, more ferociously,\r\nif possible, than before.\r\n\r\nAnd the snake? Oh! poor, weak and powerless was even that dread reptile\r\nof forty feet in length, when combated with a monster lashed on and also\r\nprotected by invisible fiends. For, as the wolf sped on again, the boa\r\nwas dragged as if by a thousand horses from its coiling hold upon the\r\nbough--and shaken, lacerated, and affrighted, the hideous reptile\r\nunwound itself from the ferocious animal, and fell powerless on the\r\ngrass, where the vermin of the forest attacked it with their greedy maws\r\nere its pestilential breath had ceased.\r\n\r\nAway--away toward the mountains rushes the Wehr-Wolf,--those mountains\r\nwhich constitute the barrier of safety to protect Nisida from the fangs\r\nof the animal that would mangle her fair form were she to cross its\r\npath. But, ah! he rushes up the acclivity--he clears rugged rock and\r\njutting crag with wondrous bounds;--just Heaven! will he pass those\r\nheights--will he cross the range of volcanic hills?\r\n\r\nOh! Nisida, who art on the other side of that range, little dreamest\r\nthou of the peril that menaces thee. Joy! joy!--the danger has passed;\r\nthe wolf turns aside from a loftier impediment of crag than had yet\r\nappeared in its course: and down--down again toward the groves and\r\nvalleys--over the bituminous waste made by the volcano--on, on goes the\r\nmonster. Away, away, through the verdant scenes once more, fresh\r\nhavoc--fresh desolation--fresh ruin marking his maddening course,--away,\r\naway the Wehr-Wolf speeds.\r\n\r\nThe moon rises to give a stronger and purer light to the dreadful\r\nspectacle, a light stronger and purer than that of night itself, which\r\nis never completely dark in the tropics. Away, away, and still on,\r\non--outstripping time--running a race with the fleeting moments, till\r\nhours and hours of unrelaxing speed are numbered--thus goes the wolf.\r\nAnd now he snuffs the morning air: the fresh breeze from the east raises\r\nthe foam of the Mediterranean waves, and allays the heat on the body of\r\nthe careening, bounding, and almost flying monster.\r\n\r\nHis howling grows less ferocious--his yells become less terrible; and\r\nnow his pace is a trifle more measured,--that relaxation of a whirlwind\r\nspeed gradually increasing.\r\n\r\n'Tis done; the course is o'er--the race is run;--and the Wehr-Wolf falls\r\nin writhing agonies upon the fresh grass, whence in a few moments rises\r\nFernand Wagner--a man once more! But as he throws a glance of horror\r\naround on the scene of his night's dread employment, he starts back with\r\nmingled aversion and alarm; for there--with folded arms, eyes terrible\r\nto look upon, and a countenance expressing infernal triumph and bitter\r\nscorn, stood the demon.\r\n\r\n\"Fiend, what would'st thou with me?\" demanded Wagner. \"Are not the\r\nsufferings which I have just endured, enough to satisfy thy hatred of\r\nall human beings? are not the horrors of the past night sufficient to\r\nglut even thine insatiate heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortal,\" said the demon, speaking in his profound and awe-inspiring\r\ntones, \"didst thou take all thy miseries which at this moment afflict\r\nthy race, combine all the bitter woes, and crushing sorrows that madden\r\nthe brains of men, mix up all the tears and collect all the sobs and\r\nsighs that tell of human agony, then multiply the aggregate by ten\r\nmillion, million times its sum, and go on multiplying by millions and\r\nmillions, till thou wast tired of counting, thou would'st not form even\r\nan idea of that huge amount of human misery which could alone appease\r\nme. For on man do I visit the hate wherewith my own fall has animated\r\nme; powerless on high, where once I was so powerful, I make my kingdom\r\nof earth and hell--and in both my influence is great and is terrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes; too great--too terrible!\" exclaimed Wagner. \"But why dost\r\nthou persecute me with thy presence? I did not call thee--I did not\r\ninvoke thine aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but thou requirest it!\" said the demon, with a satirical smile.\r\n\"Thinkest thou to be enabled to dream away thine existence in this\r\nisland, with the warm, impassioned Nisida? No, mortal--no! Already doth\r\nshe pine for her own native Italian clime; and she will end by loathing\r\nthee and this land, if she continue to dwell here, and with only thee as\r\nher companion. But it is in thy power to make Nisida forget\r\nItaly--Francisco--Flora--and all the grave interests and dreadful\r\nmysteries which seem to demand her presence in the busy world;--it is in\r\nthy power to render her happy and contented in this island--to attach\r\nher to thee for the remainder of thine existence--to provide her with\r\nthe means of preserving her youth and her beauty unimpaired, even as\r\nthine own--to crush forever all those pinings and longings which now\r\ncarry her glances wistfully across the sea,--in a word, to bend her mind\r\nto all thy wishes--her soul to all thy purposes! Yes;--it is in thy\r\npower to do all this--and the same decision which shall place that\r\namount of ineffable happiness within thy reach, will also redeem thee\r\nfrom the horrible destiny of a Wehr-Wolf--leaving thee thy youth and thy\r\nbeauty, and investing thee with a power equal to that enjoyed by thy\r\nlate master, Faust.\"\r\n\r\n\"And doubtless on the same conditions?\" said Wagner, half-ironically,\r\nand half in horror at the mere thought of surrendering his soul to\r\nSatan.\r\n\r\n\"Art thou blind to the means of promoting thy earthly happiness?\"\r\ndemanded the demon, fixing on Fernand a glance intended to appal and\r\nintimidate, but at which he on whom it was bent quailed not. \"Hast thou\r\nnot received sufficient experience of the terrific sufferings which\r\ntwelve times a year thou art doomed to endure? Knowest thou not on each\r\noccasion thou destroyest human life, where mortal beings are in thy\r\npath--or that thou ravagest the fair scenes which He whose name I dare\r\nnot mention has created? and art thou ignorant of the tremendous horror\r\nand loathsome obloquy which attach themselves to the name of a\r\nWehr-Wolf? See--thou art already wearied of traveling through the\r\nvarious climes of the earth; thou no longer delightest in cultivating\r\nthine intellect, so marvelously adapted to receive knowledge of all\r\nkinds; and thy power to create whole mines of wealth is exercised no\r\nmore. But thou would'st fix thine abode in this island forever, were\r\nNisida to remain thy companion! Well--and if thou losest her? for\r\nassuredly a vessel will some day touch on these shores--what would'st\r\nthou do then? All lonely, desolate, forlorn, thou would'st curse the day\r\nthat gave thee regenerated life--thou would'st seek death--and to thee\r\ndeath may not come yet for many, many years! Fernand, thou art worse\r\nthan mad not to embrace my offers. Consent to become mine--mine\r\neternally, when thy mortal breath shall leave thy body, and in the\r\nmeantime I promise thee power illimitable--happiness such as no human\r\nbeing ever yet enjoyed----\"\r\n\r\n\"No--no!\" exclaimed Wagner. \"Rather the destiny of a Wehr-Wolf--rather\r\nthe solitude of this island for the remainder of my days--than resign\r\nall chance of salvation! And that mine immortal soul is yet safe, the\r\nvery temptations thou offerest with such eloquent persuasion fully\r\nproves! Oh! Heaven, of its infinite mercy, will receive the dreadful\r\nsufferings 'tis mine to endure each month, as an atonement for that hour\r\nof weakness, madness, folly, when dazzled by the words of Faust, and\r\noverwhelmed by a weight of miseries, I accepted a regenerated existence.\r\nYes, Heaven will forgive me yet: and therefore avaunt, fiend! avaunt!\"\r\nAnd as he uttered these words he made the sign of the cross, and the\r\ndemon fled away howling. Wagner turned aside in dismay, and sank upon\r\nthe ground as if blasted by the lightning. A deep sleep fell on\r\nFernand's eyes, and in his dreams he thought he heard a solemn but\r\nrejoicing strain of music filling the air. That divine melody seemed to\r\nspeak a language eloquent and intelligible, and to give him hope and\r\npromise of a deliverance from the dreadful destiny which his weakness\r\nand folly had entailed upon him. The music grew fainter and fainter, and\r\nat the moment when it died away altogether a heavenly and radiant being\r\nrose in the midst of a cloud, an angel, clad in white and shining\r\ngarments, and with snowy wings closed, and drooping from its shoulders.\r\nLooking benignly upon the sleeping Wagner the angel said in a soft and\r\nliquid tone, \"Thrice hast thou resisted the temptations of the enemy of\r\nmankind: once in thy dungeon at Florence, a second time amidst the\r\ndefiles of yon mountains, and now on this spot. He will appear to thee\r\nno more, unless thou thyself summon him. Much hast thou already done in\r\natonement for the crime that endangered thy soul when, withdrawing thy\r\nfaith from Heaven, thou didst accept new life on the conditions proposed\r\nto thee by the agent of Satan; but much more must thou yet do, ere that\r\natonement will be complete!\" The form ceased to speak, and gradually\r\nbecame fainter and fainter, until it disappeared with its glorious halo\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nThen Fernand awoke, and his dream was vividly impressed upon his memory.\r\n\r\nAssuming a kneeling posture, he clasped his hands fervently together,\r\nand said aloud, \"Merciful Heaven! be the vision one divinely sent, or be\r\nit but the sport of an imagination fevered by a long night of suffering,\r\nI receive it as an emblem and as a sign of hope and promise!\"\r\n\r\nHe arose. The sun was now high in the heaven, and he hastened to the\r\nshore to perform his ablutions. Refreshed in body with the bath which he\r\ntook in the Mediterranean, and in mind with the influence of the vision,\r\nhe retraced his way toward the mountains. The range was passed in\r\nsafety, and he once more set foot on that section of the island where\r\nNisida was so anxiously awaiting his presence.\r\n\r\nThe hour at which Fernand Wagner was accustomed to return after his\r\nperiodical excursions beyond the mountains, had long passed; for it will\r\nbe remembered that he had fallen asleep and slumbered some time, after\r\nhis restoration to human shape and his encounter with the demon. Nisida\r\nwas already a prey to the wildest alarms, which were not altogether\r\nuntainted with selfishness; for the enemy of mankind had led her to\r\nbelieve that Wagner had within his reach certain means of enabling her\r\nto quit the island, and she trembled lest death might have intervened to\r\nsnatch him away, and thus annihilate the hopes which had been so\r\ninsidiously infused into her soul. She was also distressed at his\r\nprolonged absence on grounds more creditable to her heart, for she\r\nshuddered at the idea that her handsome Fernand might at that very\r\nmoment be writhing in the coils of a horrible snake. Then, arousing\r\nherself, Nisida resolved to attempt the passage of the mountains, and\r\nseek for her lover and rescue him if possible, and if not, to die with\r\nhim. But as she drew near the craggy mountains she suddenly beheld the\r\nobject of her anxiety approaching her, and in a few minutes they were\r\nlocked in each other's arms.\r\n\r\n\"My Fernand,\" said Nisida at length, \"I feared that some danger had\r\nbefallen you, and I was hastening to join you on the other side of these\r\nheights, either to aid you in escaping from the peril, or to share its\r\nconsequences with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beloved Nisida!\" exclaimed Wagner, \"how welcome to me is this proof of\r\nthy regard, this earnest of thy love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can never cease to love you, dear Fernand,\" answered Nisida, turning\r\nher fine large eyes upon his handsome face. \"Oh, that I should seek to\r\nquit thee! The thought smites me to the inmost recesses of my heart. And\r\nyet it is to some extent thy fault, for wherefore wilt thou not\r\naccompany me?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, beloved one,\" replied Wagner, \"thou talkest as if a\r\nship were already in sight, or a boat lay ready to launch from this\r\nshore; secondly, I have before assured thee that I dared not return to\r\nFlorence, and that as I cannot therefore be thy companion thither, it\r\nwould be better for me to remain on the island, to which, perhaps,\" he\r\nadded in a mournful tone, \"you might, after all, never come back!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Fernand, think not so ill of your Nisida!\" she cried, throwing one\r\nof her snowy full arms round his neck, and looking earnestly, but yet\r\ntenderly on his countenance. \"Never, never shall I know happiness again\r\nuntil I have revisited Florence. Each day that passes without giving me\r\na hope to see this aim fulfilled, increases my misery, adds to my\r\nuneasiness, augments my anxiety--so that in a short time my suspense\r\nwill become intolerable. It is nearly so already, Fernand--but pity me;\r\nyes--and help me, if you can!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest Nisida, willingly would I sacrifice my own inclinations to\r\nforward thine,\" exclaimed Wagner in a tone of deep sincerity; \"but how\r\nis it possible that I can aid thee? I have not wings to affix to thy\r\nfair shoulder, I have not a voice powerful enough to raise echoes on a\r\nshore whence assistance might be sent. Nay, look not so sternly on me,\r\nbeloved Nisida, I did not intend to vex thee with idle jestings; but\r\nthou knowest that I cannot aid thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fernand, you love me not!\" exclaimed Nisida, suddenly withdrawing her\r\narm from its fond position about his neck, and retreating a few paces.\r\n\"No; you do not love me as you were wont, or as I love you! You\r\ndoubtless have some means of gratifying my ardent longings. A secret\r\nvoice whispers within me that if you chose to exert all your powers, you\r\nmight render me happy--at least so happy as I could be when separated\r\nfrom you! I have assured you that naught save the most important\r\ninterests would render me thus anxious to return to my native city; and\r\nif you find me thus importunate, you should pity me, not refuse to aid\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin! this is maddening!\" cried Wagner. \"Nisida--be reasonable;\r\nhow can I assist thee? how can I enable thee to cross that sea which\r\nappears to us boundless? And thou accusest me of not loving thee,\r\nNisida! Oh! this is too cruel!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is thou who art cruel!\" exclaimed Nisida, in an impassioned\r\ntone. \"I know that you are not a being of an ordinary stamp, that your\r\nintellect is as wonderful as your person is godlike,--and that you\r\npossess a mine of knowledge in the extent of which no mortal can equal\r\nthee. Is it strange--is it marvelous, then, that I should implore thee\r\nto exert thy powers--the vast powers of thy glorious intelligence, to\r\nforward my design? Nay, seek not to interrupt me, Fernand, denial is\r\nvain! A secret voice continues to whisper within me that thou art able\r\nto do all I ask; I know not the means to be used--I seek not to know\r\nthem; but that thou hast such means within thy reach, is a conviction\r\nfirmly impressed upon my mind. Here, then, Fernand, at thy feet, on my\r\nknees, do I implore thee, beseech thee, not to refuse the boon which I,\r\nthy loving wife, crave at the hands of thee, my husband, as if I were a\r\nhumble suppliant suing at the footstool of a throned king!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida, Nisida!\" cried Fernand, painfully excited by this sudden\r\nmovement on her part, and endeavoring to rise: \"what means so strange a\r\nproceeding? Rise, dearest, rise; it is not to me that you must thus\r\nhumble yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I will not quit this suppliant attitude until you shall have\r\ngranted my request--my prayer,\" said Nisida. \"Refuse me not, my Fernand.\r\nOh! I implore you not to refuse me! Whatever means be within your reach,\r\nexert them on my behalf. A brother's interest, the remembrance of a\r\nsolemn vow breathed only to my lamented and much-wronged mother--and the\r\nsafeguard of a mystery, the discovery of which by curious and prying\r\neyes would heap infamy and disgrace upon the family that bears the name\r\nof Riverola--all these reasons render me thus anxious to return to\r\nItaly. And if you keep me here, Fernand, I shall pine away--I shall\r\nperish before your eyes, and you will repent of your harshness when it\r\nis too late. Or else,\" she added, speaking with wild rapidity, \"I shall\r\nbe reduced to despair, and in a moment of excitement shall seek death in\r\nthose silent waters, or climb yon craggy mountains to fling myself\r\nheadlong from their summit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida, your menaces are maddening as your supplications to me are vain\r\nand useless!\" said Wagner, himself now laboring under a fearful\r\nexcitement. \"Rise, I implore you, rise, and let us endeavor to converse\r\nmore calmly--more rationally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I will rise,\" said Nisida, now affecting a sullen haughtiness, and\r\npreparing to wield another of the weapons which the demon had placed in\r\nher hand: \"I rise, Fernand, because I feel that I was wrong thus to\r\nabase myself--I, who bear the proud name of Riverola;\"--and she tossed\r\nher head indignantly. \"Well--it seems that you are resolved to keep me\r\nchained to your side on this island. Be it so: but henceforth let there\r\nbe no mistrust--no mystery--no secrets between us. If Italy must be\r\nforgotten forever, then this isle shall become our world, and our\r\nthoughts shall travel not beyond its confines. All shall be mutual\r\nconfidence--a reciprocal outpouring of our minutest thoughts. On that\r\ncondition only will existence _here_ be tolerable to us both. And now as\r\na proof that thou wilt assent to this proposal--than which nothing can\r\nbe more rational--let our new life of mutual confidence date from this\r\nmoment. Tell me then, my Fernand,\" she proceeded, assuming a winning\r\nmanner, and throwing as much pathos as possible into her sweetly musical\r\nvoice--that voice which gave new and indescribable, charms to the soft\r\nItalian language--\"tell me then, my Fernand, wherefore thou quittest me\r\nat certain intervals--why thou invariably seekest on those occasions the\r\nopposite side of the island--and whether thou wilt in future suffer me\r\nto be the companion of those journeys?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou be my companion--thou, Nisida!\" exclaimed Wagner, his whole frame\r\nconvulsed with mental agony. \"Merciful Heaven! what fiend has prompted\r\nthee thus to speak! Nisida,\" he said, suddenly exercising a strong\r\nmastery over his emotions, as he seized her hand and pressed it with\r\nspasmodic violence--\"Nisida, as thou valuest our happiness seek not to\r\npenetrate into my secret--proffer not that mad request again!\"\r\n\r\nAnd dropping her hand he paced the shore with the agitation of reviving\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Fernand,\" said Nisida, approaching him, and once more speaking in a\r\nresolute and even severe tone--\"listen to me. When we met upon the\r\nisland, an accident of a terrible nature led me to forget my vow of\r\nself-imposed dumbness; and when the excitement occasioned by that\r\naccident had somewhat passed you were in doubt whether you had really\r\nheard my voice or had been deluded by fevered imagination. It would have\r\nbeen easy for me to simulate dumbness again; and you would have believed\r\nthat the bewilderment of the dread scene had misled you. But I chose not\r\nto maintain a secret from thee--and I confess that my long supposed loss\r\nof two glorious faculties was a mere deed of duplicity on my part. At\r\nthat time you said that you also had explanations to give; and yet\r\nmonths and months have passed by, and confidence has not begotten\r\nconfidence. Let this mistrust on your part cease. Reveal to me the cause\r\nof these frequent excursions across the mountains; or else the next time\r\nthat you set out on one of these mysterious journeys, I shall assuredly\r\nbecome your companion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Nisida,\" exclaimed Wagner, his heart rent with indescribable\r\ntortures--\"it is you who are cruel--you are unjust!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Fernand--it is you!\" cried Nisida, in a thrilling, penetrating\r\ntone, as if of anguish.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heaven! what misery is in store for us both!\" said Wagner,\r\npressing his hand to his burning brow. \"Oh! that some ship would appear\r\nto bear thee away--or that my destiny were other than it is!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he flung himself upon the sand in a fit of blank despair. Nisida now\r\ntrembled at the violence of those emotions which she had raised in the\r\nbreast of him whom she loved; and for a minute she reproached herself\r\nfor having so implicitly obeyed the counsel of the evil spirit.\r\n\r\nHer own feelings were worked up to that pitch of excitement with which\r\nwomen--even in the strongest-minded, must have its vent in tears; and\r\nshe burst into an agony of weeping.\r\n\r\nThe sound of those sobs was more than the generous-hearted and\r\naffectionate Fernand could bear; and starting from the sand whereon he\r\nhad flung himself, he exclaimed, \"Nisida, my beloved Nisida, dry those\r\ntears, subdue this frenzied grief! Let us say no more upon these\r\nexciting topics this evening; but I will meditate, I will reflect upon\r\nthe morrow, and then I will communicate to thee the result of my\r\ndeliberations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! there is then hope for me yet!\" cried Nisida, joyfully; \"and thou\r\nhast the means to grant my wishes, but thou fearest to use them. We will\r\nsay no more this evening on subjects calculated to give so little\r\npleasure; but to-morrow, my Fernand, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nisida stopped her own utterance by pressing her lips to those of\r\nWagner, winding her beauteous arms most lovingly round his neck at the\r\nsame time, and pressing him to her bosom.\r\n\r\nBut that night and the ensuing morn were destined to wring the\r\nheart-cords of the unhappy Fernand: for the influence of the demon,\r\nthough unknown and unrecognized, was dominant with Nisida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was night--and Fernand was pacing the sand with even greater\r\nagitation than he had manifested during the cruel scene of the evening.\r\nHe was alone on the seashore; and Nisida slept in the hut. Terrible\r\nthoughts warred in the breast of Wagner. Nisida's language had\r\nastonished and alarmed him: he was convinced that Satan himself had\r\ninspired her with those ideas, the utterance of which had nearly goaded\r\nhim to madness. She had insisted on the belief that he was acquainted\r\nwith the means of enabling her to return to Italy; and yet Nisida was\r\nnot a mere girl--a silly, whimsical being, who would assert the wildest\r\nphysical impossibilities just as caprice might prompt her. No--she\r\nreally entertained that belief--but without having any ostensible\r\ngrounds to establish it.\r\n\r\n\"Such an impression could only have been made upon her mind by the fiend\r\nwho seeks to entangle me in his meshes!\" murmured Wagner to himself, as\r\nhe paced the strand. \"The demon has failed to tempt me as yet--thrice\r\nhas he failed;--and now he musters all his force to assail me,--to\r\nassail me, too, in the most vulnerable points! But, O Heaven, give me\r\nstrength to resist the dread influence thus brought to bear upon me!\r\nWhat course can I adopt? what plan pursue? If to-morrow must witness a\r\nrenewal of that scene which occurred this evening, I shall succumb--I\r\nshall yield; in a moment of despair I shall exclaim, 'Yes, Nisida--I\r\nwill sacrifice everything to acquire the power to transport thee back to\r\nItaly;'--and I shall hurry to yon mountains, and seeking their wildest\r\ndefile, shall evoke the enemy of mankind, and say, 'Come, Satan, I give\r\nthee my soul in exchange for the illimitable power thou offerest.' And\r\nthus will be the terrible result--the fearful catastrophe.\"\r\n\r\nBig drops of agony stood upon Fernand's brow as he uttered these words.\r\nHe saw that he was hovering on the verge of a fearful abyss--and he\r\ntrembled lest he should fall, so intense was his love for Nisida. At one\r\nmoment he thought of the soothing vision, full of hope and promise,\r\nwhich had occupied his slumber in the morning; at another he pondered on\r\nthe tears, the prayers, and the threats of Nisida. The conflicting\r\nthoughts were, indeed, sufficient to urge him on to a state of utter\r\ndespair:--his eternal salvation and the happiness of her whom he loved\r\nso tenderly were placed in such antagonistic position that they raised a\r\nfierce--a painful--an agonizing warfare in his breast. Now he would fall\r\nupon his knees and pray--and pray fervently for strength to continue in\r\nthe right path: then he would again give way to all the maddening\r\ninfluences of his bitter reflections; and, while in this mood, had Satan\r\nsuddenly stood before him, he would have succumbed--yes, he would have\r\nsuccumbed. But the fiend had no longer any power to offer direct\r\ntemptation to the wretched Wagner. Oh! if he could die that moment, how\r\ngladly would he release himself from an existence fraught with so much\r\nmisery; but death was not yet within the reach of him who bore the doom\r\nof a Wehr-Wolf! The morning dawned, and Fernand Wagner was still pacing\r\nthe sand--dreading to meet Nisida again, and not daring to seek to avoid\r\nher. Were he to fly to the mountains or to the forests, she would search\r\nafter him; and thus he would only be leading her into perils amidst\r\nyawning precipices, or where she might become the prey of the terrible\r\nanaconda. To remain were anguish--to fly were madness!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wretch, miserable wretch that I am!\" exclaimed Wagner, as he beheld\r\nthe twilight--so short in the tropics--growing more powerful, and knew\r\nthat Nisida would soon come forth from the hut. In a few minutes the orb\r\nof day appeared above the Orient wave--and almost at the same time the\r\nlady made her appearance on the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Fernand, thou hast not sought repose throughout the night just past!\"\r\nshe said, advancing toward him, and endeavoring to read upon his\r\ncountenance the thoughts which filled his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Nisida,\" he replied, in a rapid and excited tone, \"I have gone through\r\nso much during the last few hours that 'tis a marvel reason has\r\nmaintained its seat. If thou lovest me, let us forget all those topics\r\nwhich have so strongly excited us both: and let us unite our prayers\r\nthat Heaven will send thee means to quit this isle and return to thy\r\nnative land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fernand,\" said Nisida, in a tone of deep disappointment and reproach,\r\n\"I was not prepared for this. Your words imply that you possess the\r\npower to aid my departure hence, but that you have resolved not to use\r\nit. Is that your decision?\"\r\n\r\n\"I scorn to deceive thee, Nisida, by a direct falsehood in so serious a\r\nmatter as this,\" exclaimed Wagner. \"Knowest thou, my beloved, at what\r\nprice must be purchased the power which alone can enable _me_ to effect\r\nthy return to Italy? canst thou divine the immeasurable sacrifice which\r\nI must make to gratify thy wishes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fernand,\" answered Nisida, in a reproachful and yet resolute tone,\r\n\"there is no price that I would not pay to obtain the means of pleasing\r\nthee!--there is no sacrifice that I should shrink from were your\r\nhappiness at stake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida,\" ejaculated Wagner, in a tone of fearful excitement, \"you drive\r\nme to despair! Have mercy upon me, Nisida, have mercy upon me! My God!\r\nif you taunt me--if you reproach me--thus I will do all that you\r\ncommand; but force me not to believe, Nisida--my well beloved\r\nNisida--that, in espousing thee in the sight of Heaven, I took to my\r\nbosom a fiend instead of a woman, a relentless demon in the most\r\ncharming female shape that evil spirit ever wore. Oh! if you knew all,\r\nyou would pity me as it is. So wretched on earth you would not compel me\r\nto renounce every hope of salvation; for, know, Nisida,\" he added, his\r\ncountenance wearing an expression of indescribable horror, \"know that in\r\ndemanding of me this last sacrifice, you ordain that I should sell my\r\nimmortal soul to Satan!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Nisida appeared shocked and appalled at the words which met\r\nher ears; but she rather recoiled from the manner of fearful excitement\r\nin which they were uttered, than from the intelligence which they\r\nconveyed.\r\n\r\n\"He who truly loves,\" she said coldly, as she recovered her equanimity,\r\n\"would make _even that_ sacrifice! and now listen--Fernand,\" she\r\ncontinued, her eyes flashing fire, and her naked bosom heaving\r\nconvulsively as she spoke, while her splendid form was drawn up to its\r\nfull height, and her whole aspect sublimely terrible and wondrously\r\nbeautiful, even in that fit of agitated passion--\"listen, Fernand!\" she\r\ncried, in her musical, flute-like voice, which, however, assumed the\r\nimperious accent and tone of command: \"thou art a coward, and unworthy\r\nsuch an earnest--such a profound, such a devoted love as mine, if thou\r\nrefusest to consummate a sacrifice which will make us both powerful and\r\ngreat as long as we live! Consider, my Fernand--the spirit with whom\r\nthou wouldst league thyself can endow us with an existence running over\r\ncenturies to come, can invest us with eternal youth, can place countless\r\ntreasures at our disposal, can elevate us to the proudest thrones of\r\nChristendom! Oh! wilt thou spurn advantages like those? wilt thou refuse\r\nto avail thyself of gifts that must render us so supremely happy? No,\r\nno: and we can return together to my native city, we can enter Florence\r\nin triumph, thou no longer fearing the terror of the law, I no longer\r\ncompelled to simulate the doom of the deaf and dumb! Our enemies shall\r\nlick the dust at our feet, and we shall triumph wherever success may be\r\ndesirable. Oh! I understand that beseeching, appealing look, Fernand:\r\nthou thinkest that I shall love thee less if this immense sacrifice be\r\nconsummated, that I shall look upon thee with loathing. No, not so: and\r\nto convince thee that mine is a soul endowed with an iron will, that\r\nmine is an energy which can grapple even with remorse, I will reveal to\r\nthee a secret which thou hast perhaps never even suspected. Fernand!\"\r\nshe exclaimed, now becoming absolutely terrible with the excitement that\r\nanimated her; \"Fernand!\" she repeated, \"'twas I who murdered the girl\r\nAgnes, in the garden of thy mansion at Florence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou, thou, Nisida?\" almost shrieked Wagner wildly; \"oh, no, no! Recall\r\nthat dreadful avowal! And yet--oh! yes--I see it all--my former\r\nsuspicions are confirmed. Wretched woman. What harm did the unfortunate\r\nAgnes do to thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw in her a rival, Fernand--or fancied that she was so,\" answered\r\nNisida; \"I overheard your conversation with her that morning in the\r\ngarden--I saw her embrace thee tenderly--mine ears drank in her words;\r\noh, I remember them even now! She said, 'Oh, what a night of uneasiness\r\nhave I passed! But at length thou art restored to me; thou whom I have\r\never loved so fondly; although I abandoned thee for so long a time!'\r\nWere not those her very words? And thou didst speak to her in a tone\r\nequally tender. Ah! I have ever suspected that she was thy mistress;\r\nalthough thou didst swear upon the cross, in thy dungeon, that she was\r\nnot. But so great was my love for thee, that I smothered the dread\r\nsuspicion----\"\r\n\r\n\"Suspicion,\" repeated Wagner, in the penetrating tone of heart-rending\r\nanguish,--an anguish so intense that his brain whirled, and he knew not\r\nwhat he said or did. \"Oh, wretched woman, and thou didst slay Agnes on a\r\nmere suspicion?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hated her--even before I entertained that suspicion,\" exclaimed\r\nNisida, impatiently; \"for she was the mistress of my father! Thinkest\r\nthou that my quick ears had not gleaned the mysterious whisperings which\r\nfrequently passed between my sire and his valet Antonio, relative to the\r\nlady who dwelt in seclusion at the abode of that menial's mother? or\r\nthinkest thou that when I once obtained a clew to my father's degrading\r\npassion, I scrupled to watch him, to follow him, to learn all his\r\nproceedings? No; for it was the more easily to enact the spy upon my own\r\nfather that originally simulated the doom of the deaf and dumb. A purse\r\nof gold induced Dame Margaretha, Antonio's mother, to give me admission\r\ninto her house; though she also believed that I was really deprived of\r\nthe faculties of hearing and of speech. But often and often was I\r\nconcealed in the chamber adjacent to that where my father passed hours\r\nwith his mistress; and it was not without advantage that I so acted. For\r\nI discovered that amongst the presents which he had given her, were the\r\njewels which had belonged to my sainted mother--that mother whose wrongs\r\nwere so manifold, and whose sufferings were so great. Yes: and I\r\npossessed myself of those jewels, leaving the girl the other gifts which\r\nshe had received from my sire.\r\n\r\n\"And now, since I am involved in relations of such import, I shall do\r\nwell to inform thee, Fernand, that I had seen and loved thee before thou\r\ndidst come as a visitor to our mansion in Florence. For it was my habit\r\nto proceed occasionally to the dwelling of the good Dr. Duras, the\r\ndepositary of my grand secret of the feigned loss of faculties; and\r\nwhile wandering alone in his garden I once beheld thee! And the moment I\r\nbeheld I loved thee. Often--often after that would I visit the kind\r\nphysician's grounds, whereof I possessed a pass-key; and my admiration\r\nof thee led me to pass the slight boundary which separated his garden\r\nfrom thine. Then I would approach the windows of thy dwelling and\r\ncontemplate thee as thou wast seated in thy favorite apartment. On the\r\nnight of my father's funeral, although so very late when all the\r\nsubsequent business connected with the reading of the will was\r\nconcluded, my mind was so perturbed and restless that I could not sleep;\r\nand quitting the Riverola mansion by a private door, I sought the fresh\r\nair with the hope that it would calm me. Some vague and indescribable\r\nsentiment of curiosity, or else something that I heard on the return of\r\nthe mourners, relative to the strange scene enacted in the church, I\r\nknow not which, led me to the vicinity of your abode; and there, in your\r\nfavorite room, I beheld you seated, listening attentively to some sweet\r\nwords, doubtless, which Agnes was breathing into your ear. But she\r\ncaught a glimpse of my countenance by the light of the lamps----\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough!\" exclaimed Wagner; \"thou hast indeed cleared up\r\ninnumerable mysteries! But, oh! Nisida--would that thou hadst remained\r\nsilent--that thou hadst not drawn aside the veil which my elevated\r\nopinion of thee had thrown over the suspicions that, I admit, from time\r\nto time----\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I have told thee all this, Fernand,\" interrupted Nisida,\r\nimpatiently, \"it is that thou may'st be convinced not only of the\r\nnatural energy of my mind, but also of the deep love which I bear thee.\r\nAnd now, now that thou seest me in my true character, a murderess if\r\nthou wilt,\" she added with an emphasis of bitter scorn, \"now canst thou\r\nrefuse that sacrifice----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida! Nisida! enough crime has been perpetrated by both us, Heaven\r\nknows!\" ejaculated Wagner, still writhing with the anguish produced by\r\nthe avowal which had so lately met his ears. \"Oh! accursed be the day,\r\nblotted from the annals of Time be the hour, Nisida, when thy hand\r\nstruck the fatal dagger into the heart of Agnes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! this to my face?\" said Nisida, her countenance becoming crimson\r\nwith indignation, and not her face only, but her swan-like neck, her\r\nshoulders, and her bosom. \"Then she _was_ thy mistress, Fernand! And\r\nthou didst love her, while I fancied, false one that thou art, thine\r\naffections to be wholly and solely mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida,\" exclaimed Fernand, cruelly bewildered, \"you drive me to\r\ndespair. I know not whether to loathe thee for this avowal which thou\r\nhast made, or to snatch thee to my arms, abandon all hope of salvation,\r\nand sacrifice myself entirely for one so transcendently beautiful as\r\nthou art. But thy suspicions relative to Agnes are ridiculous,\r\nmonstrous, absurd. For, as surely as thou art there, Nisida--as the\r\nheaven is above us and the earth beneath us--as surely as that I love\r\nthee so well as to be unable to reproach thee more for the deed which\r\nthou hast confessed--so surely, Nisida, was Agnes my own granddaughter,\r\nand I--I, Fernand Wagner--young, strong, and healthy as thou beholdest\r\nme, am fourscore and fifteen years of age.\"\r\n\r\nNisida started in affright, and then fixed a scrutinizing glance upon\r\nFernand's countenance; for she feared that his reason was abandoning\r\nhim--that he was raving.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Nisida, I see that you do not credit my words,\" he exclaimed; \"and\r\nyet I have told thee the solemn, sacred truth. But mine is a sad history\r\nand a dreadful fate; and if I thought that thou would'st soothe my\r\nwounded spirit, console, and not revile me, pity, and not loathe me, I\r\nwould tell thee all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, Fernand, speak!\" she cried; \"and do me not so much wrong as to\r\nsuppose that I could forget my love for thee--that love which made me\r\nthe murderer of Agnes. Besides,\" she added, enthusiastically, \"I see\r\nthat we are destined for each other; that the dark mysteries attached to\r\nboth our lives engender the closest sympathies; that we shall flourish\r\nin power, and glory, and love, and happiness together.\"\r\n\r\nWagner threw his arms around Nisida's neck, and clasped her to his\r\nbreast. He saw not in her the woman who had dealt death to his\r\ngranddaughter; he beheld in her only a being of ravishing beauty and\r\nwondrous mind, so intoxicated was he with his passion, and so great was\r\nthe magic influence which she wielded o'er his yielding spirit. Then, as\r\nher head reclined upon his breast, he whispered to her, in a few\r\nhurried, but awfully significant words, the nature of his doom, the\r\ndread conditions on which he had obtained resuscitated youth, an almost\r\nsuperhuman beauty, a glorious intellect, and power of converting the\r\nvery clods of the earth into gold and precious stones at will.\r\n\r\n\"And now, dearest,\" he added, in a plaintive and appealing tone, \"and\r\nnow thou may'st divine wherefore on the last day of every month I have\r\ncrossed these mountains; thou may'st divine, too, how my escape from the\r\nprison of Florence was accomplished; and, though no mortal power can\r\nabridge my days--though the sword of the executioner would fall harmless\r\non my neck, and the deadly poison curdle not in my veins--still, man can\r\nbind me in chains, and my disgrace is known to all Florence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But thou shalt return thither, Fernand,\" exclaimed Nisida, raising her\r\ncountenance and gazing upon him, not with horror and amazement, but in\r\npride and triumph; \"thou shalt return thither, Fernand, armed with a\r\npower that may crush all thine enemies, and blast with destructive\r\nlightning the wretches who would look slightingly on thee. Already thou\r\nart dearer, far dearer to me than ever thou wast before; for I love the\r\nmarvelous--I glory in the supernatural--and thou art a being whom such\r\nwomen as myself can worship and adore. And thou repinest at thy destiny?\r\nthou shudderest at the idea of that monthly transformation which makes\r\nthy fate so grand, because it is so terrible? Oh, thou art wrong, thou\r\nart wrong, my Fernand. Consider all thou hast gained, how many, many\r\nyears of glorious youth and magnificent beauty await thee! Think of the\r\npower with which thy boundless command of wealth may invest thee. Oh,\r\nthou art happy, enviable, blest. But I--I,\" she added, the impassioned\r\nexcitement of her tone suddenly sinking into subdued plaintiveness as\r\nher charming head once more fell upon his breast--\"I am doomed to fade\r\nand wither like the other human flowers of the earth. Oh, that thought\r\nis now maddening. While thou remainest as thou art now, vested with that\r\nfine, manly beauty which won my heart when first I saw thee, and before\r\nI knew thee: I shall grow old, wrinkled, and thou wilt loathe me. I\r\nshall be like a corpse by the side of one endowed with vigorous life.\r\nOh, Fernand; this may not be; and thou canst purchase the power to\r\nbestow unperishing youth, unchanging beauty upon me; the power,\r\nmoreover, to transport us hence, and render us happy in inseparable\r\ncompanionship for long, long years to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens! Nisida,\" exclaimed Fernand, profoundly touched by the\r\nurgent, earnest appeal of the lovely siren whose persuasive eloquence\r\nbesought him to seal his own eternal damnation--\"would'st thou have me\r\nyield up my soul to the enemy of mankind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hesitate? Can you even pause to reflect?\" cried Nisida, with\r\nwhose tongue the demon himself was as it were speaking. \"Oh, Fernand,\r\nyou love me not, you have never, never loved me.\" And she burst into a\r\nflood of tears. Wagner was painfully moved by this spectacle, which\r\nconstituted so powerful an argument to support the persuasive eloquence\r\nof her late appeal. His resolution gave way rapidly--the more agonizing\r\nbecame her sobs the weaker grew his self-command; and his lips were\r\nabout to murmur the fatal assent to her prayer--about to announce his\r\nreadiness to summon the enemy of mankind and conclude the awful\r\ncompact--when suddenly there passed before his eyes the image of the\r\nguardian angel whom he had seen in his vision, dim and transparent as\r\nthe thinnest vapor, yet still perceptible and with an expression of\r\ncountenance profoundly mournful. The apparition vanished in a moment;\r\nbut its evanescent presence was fraught with salvation. Tearing himself\r\nwildly and abruptly from Nisida's embrace, Wagner exclaimed in a tone\r\nindicative of the horror produced by the revulsion of feeling in his\r\nmind, \"No--never--never!\" and, fleet as the startled deer he ran--he\r\nflew toward the mountains. Frightened and amazed by his sudden cry and\r\nsimultaneous flight, Nisida cast her eyes rapidly around to ascertain\r\nthe cause of his alarm, thinking that some dreadful spectacle had\r\nstricken terror to his soul. But ah--what sees she? Why do her glances\r\nsettle fixedly in one direction? What beholds she in the horizon? For a\r\nfew moments she is motionless, speechless, she cannot believe her eyes.\r\nThen her countenance, which has already experienced the transition from\r\nan expression of grief and alarm to one of suspense and mingled hope and\r\nfear, becomes animated with the wildest joy; and forgetting the late\r\nexciting scene as completely as if it had never taken place, but with\r\nall her thoughts and feelings absorbed in the new--the one idea which\r\nnow engrosses her--she turns her eyes rapidly round toward the\r\nmountains, exclaiming, \"Fernand, dearest Fernand! a sail--a sail.\"\r\n\r\nBut Wagner hears her not: she stamps her foot with impatient rage upon\r\nthe sand; and in another moment the groves conceal her lover from view.\r\n\r\nYes; Wagner looked not round; heard not the voice of Nisida invoking him\r\nto return, but continued his rapid flight toward the mountains, as if\r\nhurrying in anguish and in horror from the meshes which had been spread\r\nto ensnare his mortal soul. And now Nisida became all selfishness; there\r\nwas at length a hope, a sudden hope that she should be speedily enabled\r\nto quit the hated monotonous island, and her fine, large dark eyes were\r\nfixed intently upon the white sails which gradually grew more and more\r\npalpable in the azure horizon. She was not deceived; there was no doubt,\r\nno uncertainty, as to the nature of the object which now engrossed all\r\nher thoughts, and filled her heart with the wildest joy. It was indeed a\r\nship, and its course was toward the island; for, as she gazed with fixed\r\nand longing eyes, it by degrees assumed a more defined shape; and that\r\nwhich had at first appeared to be but one small white piece of canvas,\r\ngradually developed the outlines of many sails, and showed the tapering\r\nspars, until at last the black hull appeared, completing the form of a\r\nlarge and noble vessel. Joy! joy--she should yet be saved from the\r\nisland. And, ah--do the chances of that hoped-for safety multiply? Is it\r\nindeed another ship which has caught her eye in the far-off horizon?\r\nYes; and not one only, but another, and another, and another, until she\r\ncan count seven vessels, all emerging from the mighty distance, and\r\nspreading their snow-white canvas to the breeze which wafts them toward\r\nthe isle.\r\n\r\nCrowds of conflicting thoughts now rush to the mind of Nisida; and she\r\nseats herself upon the strand to deliberate as calmly as she may upon\r\nthe course which she should adopt. Alas, Fernand: thou wast not then\r\nuppermost in the imagination of thy Nisida, although she had not\r\nentirely forgotten thee. But the principal topic of her meditations, the\r\ngrand question which demanded the most serious weighing and balancing in\r\nher mind, was whether she should again simulate the deafness and\r\ndumbness which she had now for many months been accustomed to affect.\r\nGrave and important interests and a deeply-rooted attachment to her\r\nbrother on the one side urged the necessity of so doing; but on the\r\nother, a fearful disinclination to resume that awful duplicity--that\r\ndreadful self-sacrifice, an apprehension lest the enjoyment of the\r\nfaculties of hearing and speech for so long a period should have\r\nunfitted her for the successful revival and efficient maintenance of the\r\ndeceit; these were the arguments on the negative side. But Nisida's was\r\nnot a mind to shrink from any peril or revolt from any sacrifice which\r\nher interests or her aims might urge her to encounter; and it was with\r\nfire-flashing eyes and a neck proudly arching, that she raised her head\r\nin a determined manner, exclaiming aloud, \"Yes, it must be so. But the\r\nperiod of this renewed self-martyrdom will not last long. So soon as\r\nthine interests shall have been duly cared for, Francisco, I will quit\r\nFlorence forever, I will return to this island, and here will I pass the\r\nremainder of my days with thee, my beloved Fernand! And that I _do_ love\r\nthee still, Fernand, although thou hast fled from my presence as if I\r\nwere suddenly transformed into a loathsome monster, that I must ever\r\ncontinue to love thee, Fernand, and that I shall anxiously long to\r\nreturn to thine arms, are truths as firmly based as the foundations of\r\nthe island. Thine, then, shall be the last name, thy name shall be the\r\nlast word that I will suffer my lips to pronounce ere I once more place\r\nthe seal upon them. Yes, I love thee, Fernand; oh! would to God that\r\nthou could'st hear me proclaim how much I love thee, my beauteous, my\r\nstrangely-fated Fernand!\"\r\n\r\nIt was almost in a despairing tone that Nisida gave utterance to these\r\nlast words; for as the chance of escape from the island grew every\r\nmoment less equivocal, by the nearer approach of the fleet, which was,\r\nhowever, still far from the shore, the intensity of her sensual passion\r\nfor Wagner, that passion which she believed to be the purest and most\r\nfirmly rooted love, revived; and her heart smote her for her readiness\r\nto abandon him to the solitude of that island. But as she was now\r\nacquainted with all the mysteries of his fate, as she knew that he could\r\nnot die for many, many years to come, nor lose that glorious beauty\r\nwhich had proved alike her pleasure and her pride, her remorse and her\r\nalarms were to a considerable degree mitigated: for she thought within\r\nherself, _although she now spoke aloud no more_; \"Death will not snatch\r\nhim from me, disease will not impair his godlike features and elegant\r\nform, and he loves me too well not to receive me with open arms when I\r\nshall be enabled to return to him.\" These were her thoughts: and\r\nstarting upon her feet, she compressed her lips tightly, as if to remind\r\nherself that she had once more placed a seal there, a seal not to be\r\nbroken for some time. An hour had now passed since Fernand Wagner and\r\nNisida separated on the seashore; and he did not come back. Meantime the\r\nfleet of ships had drawn nearer, and though she more than once\r\nentertained the idea of hastening after Wagner to implore him to\r\naccompany her whithersoever those vessels were bound, or at least to\r\npart with the embrace of tenderness, yet her fear lest the ships might\r\nsail past without touching at the island, predominated over her softer\r\nfeelings. And now, having settled in her mind the course she was to\r\nadopt, she hastened to the stores which she had saved from the wreck of\r\nthe corsair vessel, and which had been piled up on the strand the day\r\nafter she was first thrown on that Mediterranean isle.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that amongst the articles thus saved were changes\r\nof apparel, which Stephano Verrina had procured for her use at Leghorn\r\nere the corsair-bark set sail on that voyage from which it never\r\nreturned, and during Nisida's long sojourn on the island, she had\r\nfrequently examined those garments, and had been careful to secure them\r\nfrom the effects of rain or damp, in the hope that the day would sooner\r\nor later come when she might assume them for the purpose of bidding\r\nadieu to that lovely but monotonous island. And now that day has come;\r\nand the moment so anxiously longed for appeared to be rapidly\r\napproaching. Nisida accordingly commenced her toilet, as if she had only\r\njust risen from her couch and was preparing to dress to go abroad\r\namongst the busy haunts of human beings.\r\n\r\nHer dark luxuriant hair, which so long had floated negligently upon her\r\nivory shoulders, was now gathered up in broad massive bands at the\r\nsides, and artistically plaited and confined at the back of her\r\nwell-shaped head. The tight bodice was next laced over the swelling\r\nbosom: hose and light boots imprisoned the limbs which had so often\r\nborne her glancing along in their nudity to the soft music of the stream\r\nin the vale or of the wavelets of the sea; broidery set off the fine\r\nform of Nisida in all the advantage of its glowing, full and voluptuous\r\nproportions. Then the large black veil was fastened to the plaits of her\r\nhair, whence its ample folds swept over that admirable symmetry of\r\nperson, endowing her once more with the queen-like air which became so\r\nwell her splendid, yet haughty style of beauty! Yes: no longer subdued\r\nby simplicity of attire--no longer tender and soft, was the loveliness\r\nof Nisida; but grand, imperious, and dazzling did she now seem again, as\r\nerst she seemed ere her foot trod that island-shore.\r\n\r\nAppareled in handsome garments, and with the rich carnation glow of\r\nhealth and animation on her cheeks, and with her eyes flashing the fires\r\nof hope, but with the vermilion lips compressed, Nisida now stood on the\r\nstrand where so oft she had wandered like a naiad, feeling no shame at\r\nher semi-nudity.\r\n\r\nDuring the time occupied by her toilet, the fleet of seven ships had\r\napproached much nearer to the island, and now they were not more than\r\nthree miles distant. The hulls, which at first had seemed quite black,\r\nshone, as they drew closer, with the gay colors in which they were\r\npainted, the gorgeous sunlight playing vividly on the gilding of the\r\nprows, the streaks of red and white along the sides, and the splendid\r\ndecorations of the poop lanterns. Noble and mighty ships they\r\nwere--ships of size such as Nisida had never seen before, and in\r\ncomparison with which all the merchant-vessels she had beheld at Leghorn\r\nwere but mere boats. There was no need to raise a signal to invite them\r\nto approach--for that fleet was evidently steering toward the island.\r\nWhence did this fleet come? whither was it bound? to what nation did it\r\nbelong? and would those on board treat her with attention and respect?\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts which flashed across her brain--and her heart\r\nbeat with anxiety for the arrival of the moment which should solve those\r\nquestions. Absorbed as she was in the contemplation of the noble\r\nships--those mighty but graceful swans of the ocean--she did not forget\r\nto cast, from time to time, a rapid glance around, to see if Fernand\r\nwere retracing his way toward her. Alas! no--he came not--and she must\r\nquit the isle without embracing him--without assuring him of her\r\nconstant love--without renewing her oft-repeated promise to return. Ah!\r\na thought struck her: she would leave a note for him in the hut! No\r\nsooner was the project determined on than she set about its execution;\r\nfor there were writing materials amidst the stores saved from the\r\ncorsair-wreck. A brief but tender letter was hastily penned, and then\r\nsecured in a place where she knew he must find it should he revisit the\r\nrude tenement in which they had so often slept in each other's arms. And\r\nthat he would revisit it she both fondly hoped and firmly\r\nbelieved--revisit it so soon as the excitement and the terror, under the\r\ninfluence of which he had parted from her, should have subsided. Her\r\nmind was now much easier, and her beauty was wonderfully enhanced by the\r\nglow of animation which suffused itself over her countenance, giving\r\nadditional light to her ever brilliant eyes, and rendering her noble\r\naquiline face resplendent to gaze upon.\r\n\r\nThe ships came to anchor at a distance of about two miles from the\r\nshore: and though the banners of each were fluttering in the breeze, yet\r\nNisida was not well skilled enough in discriminating the flags of\r\ndifferent nations to be able immediately to satisfy herself to which\r\ncountry that fleet belonged. But as she stood with her eyes fixed on the\r\nforemost vessel, which was also the largest, she observed that there was\r\na gilt crescent in the middle of the blood-red standard that floated\r\nover her central poop-lantern; and a chill struck to her heart--for the\r\nthought of African pirates flashed to her mind! This alarm was, however,\r\nas evanescent as it was poignant; for another moment's reflection\r\nconvinced her that none of the princes of Africa could send so proud a\r\nfleet to sea. Following up the chain of reasoning thus suggested, and\r\ncalling to her aid all the accounts she had read of naval fights between\r\nthe Christians and the Moslems, she at length remembered that the\r\nblood-red banner, with the gilt crescent in the middle, denoted the\r\npresence of the Kapitan-Pasha, or Lord High Admiral of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire. Confidently believing that peace existed between Italy and\r\nTurkey, she had now no longer any fears as to the treatment she was\r\nlikely to experience at the hands of the Mohammedans; and it was with\r\nunfeigned joy that she beheld a boat, which had put off from the\r\nadmiral's ship, at length approaching the shore.\r\n\r\nAs the magnificently painted and gorgeously gilt barge, which\r\ntwenty-four white-turbaned rowers urged along with almost horse-race\r\nspeed, neared the strand, Nisida observed, beneath a velvet canopy in\r\nthe stern, a personage, who by his splendid apparel, his commanding\r\ndemeanor, and the respect paid to him by the slaves accompanying him,\r\nwas evidently of exalted rank. She accordingly conceived that this must\r\nbe the kapitan-pasha himself. But she was mistaken. Her delight at the\r\napproach of the barge, which she fondly hoped would prove the means of\r\nher deliverance from the island, was only equaled by the surprise of\r\nthose on board at beholding a beautiful and elegantly dressed lady,\r\nunattended and alone, on the seashore, as if awaiting their arrival.\r\nAnd, during the few minutes which now elapsed ere the barge touched the\r\nstrand, it was evident that the high functionary seated beneath the\r\ncanopy surveyed Nisida with increasing wonder and admiration; while she,\r\non her side, could not help noticing that he was remarkably handsome,\r\nvery young, and possessing a countenance rather of an Italian than a\r\nTurkish cast of features.\r\n\r\nMeantime a profound silence, broken only by the slight and uniform\r\nsounds produced by the oars, prevailed: and when the boat touched the\r\nstrand, a long and wide plank, covered with velvet, was so placed as to\r\nenable the high functionary before alluded to to land conveniently.\r\nAttended by two slaves, who followed at a respectful distance, the\r\nMussulman chief advanced toward Nisida, whom he saluted in a manner\r\nwhich strengthened her suspicion that he was not of Turkish origin,\r\nalthough habited in the richest Oriental costume she had ever seen, and\r\nevidently holding some very superior office among the Ottomans. She\r\nreturned his salutation with a graceful bow and a sweet smile: and he\r\nimmediately addressed her in the Italian tongue--her own dear and\r\ndelightful language, saying, \"Lady, art thou the queen of this land? or\r\nart thou, as appearances would almost lead one to conjecture, a solitary\r\ninhabitant here?\"\r\n\r\nFor he saw that she was alone--beheld no traces of culture; and there\r\nwas but one miserable dwelling, and that such as she might have built up\r\nwith her own hands. Nisida shook her head mournfully, making signs that\r\nshe was deaf and dumb. The Mussulman chief uttered an ejaculation of\r\nmingled surprise and grief, and surveyed the lady with additional\r\ninterest and admiration. But in a few moments his countenance assumed a\r\nsudden expression of astonishment, as if a light had broken in upon him,\r\nsuggesting something more than a mere suspicion--nay, indeed, a positive\r\nconviction; and having examined her features with the most earnest\r\nattention, he abruptly took his tablets from the folds of his garment,\r\nand wrote something on them. He then handed them to Nisida; and it was\r\nnow her turn to experience the wildest surprise--for on the page opened\r\nto her view were these words, traced in a beautiful style of\r\ncalligraphy, and in the Italian language: \"Is it possible that your\r\nladyship can be the Donna Nisida of Riverola?\"\r\n\r\nNisida's eyes wandered in astonishment from the tablets to the\r\ncountenance of him who had penciled that question; but his features were\r\ncertainly not familiar to her--and yet she thought that there was\r\nsomething in the general expression of that handsome face not altogether\r\nunknown to her. As soon as she had partially recovered from the surprise\r\nand bewilderment produced by finding that she at least was known to the\r\nOttoman functionary, she wrote beneath his question the following reply:\r\n\"I am indeed Nisida of Riverola, who for seven long months have been the\r\nonly inhabitant of this island, whereon I was shipwrecked, and I am now\r\nanxious to return to Italy--or at all events to the first Christian port\r\nat which your fleet may touch. Have mercy upon me, then; and take me\r\nhence! But who are you, signor, that I should prove no stranger to you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Ottoman chief read these words, and hastened to reply in the\r\nfollowing manner: \"I have the honor to be the grand vizier of his\r\nimperial highness the glorious Sultan Solyman, and my name is Ibrahim. A\r\nfew months ago I encountered your brother Francisco, Count of Riverola,\r\nwho was then in command of a body of Tuscan auxiliaries, raised to\r\nassist in defending Rhodes against the invading arms of the mighty\r\nSolyman. Your brother became my prisoner, but I treated him worthily. He\r\ninformed me with bitter tears of the strange and mysterious\r\ndisappearance of his well-beloved sister, who had the misfortune to be\r\ndeprived of the faculties of hearing and speech. Your brother was soon\r\nset free, after the fall of Rhodes, and he returned to his native city.\r\nBut from all he told me of thee, lady, it was natural that I should ere\r\nnow conjecture who thou must be.\"\r\n\r\nIbrahim did not choose to add that he had remembered to have seen Nisida\r\noccasionally in their native city of Florence, and that he was indeed\r\nthe brother of her late dependent, Flora Francatelli. But the\r\nexplanation which he did give was quite sufficient to renew her deepest\r\nsurprise, as she now learnt for the first time that during her absence\r\nher brother had been engaged in the perils of warfare. The grand vizier\r\ngently withdrew from Nisida's hand the tablets on which her eyes were\r\npositively riveted; but it was only to trace a few lines to afford her\r\nadditional explanations. When he returned the tablets to her again she\r\nread as follows: \"By a strange coincidence the glorious fleet which has\r\nwafted me hither to deliver you from this lonely isle, and which is\r\nunder the command of the kapitan-pasha in person, is bound for the\r\nwestern coast of Italy. Its mission is at present known only to myself\r\nand a faithful Greek dependent; but your ladyship shall receive worthy\r\nattention and be duly conveyed to Leghorn. The squadron has been driven\r\nfrom its course by a tempest which assailed us off the island of Candia;\r\nour pilot lost his reckonings, and when land was descried this morning,\r\nit was believed to be the coast of Sicily. Hast thou, lady, any means of\r\nenlightening us as to the geographical position of this island?\"\r\n\r\nNisida answered in the ensuing manner: \"I have not the least notion of\r\nthe geographical position of the island. An eternal summer appears to\r\nprevail in this clime, which would be a terrestrial paradise were not\r\nthe forests infested by hideous serpents of an enormous size.\"\r\n\r\nIbrahim Pasha, having read this reply, summoned from the barge the\r\nofficer in command: and to him he communicated the intelligence which he\r\nhad just received from Nisida. That officer's countenance immediately\r\nunderwent a dreadful change; and, falling on his knees at Ibrahim's\r\nfeet, he made some strong appeal, the nature of which Nisida could only\r\ndivine by its emphatic delivery and the terrified manner of the\r\nindividual. Ibrahim smiled contemptuously, and motioned the officer with\r\nan imperious gesture to rise and return to the barge. Then, again,\r\nhaving recourse to the tablets, he conveyed the following information to\r\nNisida: \"Lady, it appears that this is the Isle of Snakes, situated in\r\nthe Gulf of Sictra, on the African coast. Horrible superstitions are\r\nattached to this clime: and I dare not remain longer on its shore, lest\r\nI should seriously offend the prejudices of those ignorant sailors.\r\nCome, then, lady, you shall receive treatment due to your rank, your\r\nbeauty, and your misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the officer had returned to the barge, where whispers\r\nspeedily circulated in respect to the land on which that boat had\r\ntouched; and the reader may imagine the extent of the loathing which the\r\nmere name of the isle was calculated to inspire in the breasts of the\r\nsuperstitious Mussulmans, when we observe that the existence of that\r\nisland was well known to the Turks and also to the Africans, but was\r\nleft uninhabited, and was never visited knowingly by any of their ships.\r\nNisida saw that the grand vizier was in haste to depart, not through any\r\nridiculous fears on his part, because he was too enlightened to believe\r\nin the fearful tales of mermaids, genii, ghouls, vampires, and other\r\nevil spirits by which the island was said to be haunted, but because his\r\nrenegadism had been of so recent a date that he dared not, powerful and\r\naltered as he was, afford the least ground for suspecting that the light\r\nof Christianity triumphed in his soul over the dark barbarism of his\r\nassumed creed. Seeing, then, that Ibrahim Pasha was anxious to yield to\r\nthe superstitious feelings of the sailors, Nisida intimated, with a\r\ngraceful bend of the head, her readiness to accompany him. But, as she\r\nadvanced toward the boat, she cast a rapid and searching glance behind\r\nher. Alas! Wagner appeared not.\r\n\r\nA feeling of uneasiness, amounting almost to a pang of remorse, took\r\npossession of her, as she placed her foot upon the velvet-covered plank;\r\nand for an instant she hesitated to proceed.\r\n\r\nCould she abandon Fernand to the solitude of that isle? Could she\r\nrenounce the joys which his love had taught her to experience? And might\r\nshe not be enabled to persuade him to make that sacrifice which would\r\ninvest him with a power that she herself would direct and wield\r\naccording to her own pleasure and suitably to her own interests? But,\r\noh! that hesitation lasted not more than a moment; for her feet were on\r\nthe plank leading to the barge, and at a short distance floated the ship\r\nthat would bear her away from the isle.\r\n\r\nOne longing, lingering look upon the shore of that island where she had\r\nenjoyed so much happiness, even if she had experienced so much anxiety;\r\none longing, lingering look, and she hesitated no more. Ibrahim escorted\r\nher to a seat beneath the velvet canopy; the officer in command gave the\r\nsignal, the barge was shoved off, the rowers plied their oars, and the\r\nisland was already far behind, ere Nisida had the courage to glance\r\ntoward it again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now return to Fernand Wagner, whom we left flying from his\r\nNisida, flying in horror and alarm from her whom he nevertheless loved\r\nso tenderly and devotedly. He fled as if from the brink of the yawning\r\npit of hell, into which the malignant fiend who coveted his soul was\r\nabout to plunge him. Nor once did he look back. Absorbed as his feelings\r\nwere in the full conviction of the tremendous peril from which he had\r\njust escaped, he still found room for the reflection that were he to\r\nturn and catch but one glimpse of the beauteous, oh! too beauteous\r\ncreature from whom he had torn himself away, he should be lost. His mind\r\nwas bent upon the salvation of his immortal soul; and he knew that the\r\nenemy of mankind was assailing him with a power and with an energy which\r\nnothing save the assistance of Heaven could enable him to resist. He\r\nknew also that Heaven helps only those who are willing and anxious to\r\nhelp themselves; and of this doctrine he had received a striking and\r\ntriumphant proof in the sudden and evanescent appearance of his guardian\r\nangel at the instant when, overpowered by the strong, the earnest, and\r\nthe pathetic pleading of the siren Nisida, he was about to proclaim his\r\nreadiness to effect the crowning sacrifice. And it was to avoid the\r\nchance of that direful yielding--to fly from a temptation which became\r\nirresistible when embellished with all the eloquence of a woman on whom\r\nhe doted, that Wagner sped with lightning rapidity toward the mountains.\r\n\r\nBut the beauteous form of Nisida met not now his eyes; and deeply,\r\nprofoundly, ardently as he still loved her, and felt that he must ever\r\nlove her, yet, to speak soothly, he deplored not that she was no longer\r\nthere. The vision of the previous night had so firmly established hope\r\nin his soul, that he had prepared and tutored himself, during his\r\njourney across the mountains, to sacrifice all his happiness on earth to\r\ninsure the eternal felicity of heaven.\r\n\r\nNo. Nisida was not there. But as he drew closer to the shore, he beheld,\r\nto his ineffable joy, the dark spot gradually assume that defined shape\r\nwhich left no room to doubt the truth of his vision, even were he\r\ninclined to be skeptical. For there, indeed, touching the strand, but\r\nstill so far in the water that a slight exertion would send it\r\ncompletely afloat, was a large boat, curiously shaped, and painted in a\r\nvariety of fantastic colors. It had a mast standing, but the sail was\r\nlowered and, on a closer inspection, the boat proved to be altogether\r\nunimpaired.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven delights to effect its wise intentions by natural means,\"\r\nthought Wagner within himself. \"But surely it could not have been\r\nthrough the agency of Nisida that this boat was left upon the shore?\r\nNo,\" he added aloud, after a still closer inspection; \"the rope fastened\r\nto the prow has been snapped asunder! Doubtless the boat became detached\r\nfrom one of the ships which appeared off the island yesterday, and\r\nwhich,\" he said in a low murmuring voice, and with an ill-subdued sigh,\r\n\"have afforded Nisida the means of departure hence.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat down, exhausted; and as he found leisure for recollection--as his\r\nthoughts composed themselves and settled down into something like\r\ncollected calmness--he felt a sensation of indescribable joy at having\r\ntriumphed over the appalling temptations which had beset him. And in his\r\nsoul a voice seemed to be singing an anthem of delight and gratitude;\r\nand he soon experienced a serenity of mind such as he had not known for\r\nmany hours past! When man, having yielded to temptation, succeeds in\r\nescaping the perils of the consequences, he beholds a strong motive for\r\nself-gratulation;--but how ineffably more sweet is it to be able to\r\nreflect that the temptation itself has been avoided in the first\r\ninstance, and that the dangers of the results have never even been\r\nrisked.\r\n\r\nThus thought Wagner:--but not for a moment did he attribute to any\r\nstrength of mind on his own part, the escape which had just been\r\neffected from the snares set by the evil one. No; he acknowledged within\r\nhimself, and with all due humility, that the hand of the Almighty had\r\nsustained him in his most trying moments of peril; and ere he thought of\r\nresuming his journey to that side of the island on which Nisida was not,\r\nhe knelt in fervent prayer. Rising from his knees, his eyes accidentally\r\nswept the sea:--and he was riveted to the spot from which he was about\r\nto turn away--for the white sails of the Ottoman fleet met his\r\nastonished view. He remained gazing on those objects for some time,\r\nuntil he was convinced they were nearing the island. For a few moments a\r\ndeep regret took possession of him:--he should lose his Nisida\r\nirrevocably! But his next impulse was to wrestle with this feeling--to\r\ncombat this weakness. How could he have hoped ever to rejoin her without\r\nrendering himself again liable to the witchery of her siren tongue--the\r\neloquence of her silver-toned voice--the persuasiveness of her graceful\r\nmanners? No; it were better that she should depart; it were preferable\r\nthat he should lose her and preserve his immortal soul. Thus reasoned\r\nhe;--and that reasoning was effectual. He waited only long enough to\r\nassure himself that the fleet was positively approaching the island:--he\r\nthen knew that she would depart;--and, without permitting himself to\r\nyield again to the weakness which had for a few moments threatened to\r\nsend him back within the sphere of Nisida's fatal influence, he tore\r\nhimself away from that point amongst the heights which commanded the\r\nview of the side of the island where she was. Hastening around the base\r\nof the volcano, he reached the defiles leading to that part of the isle\r\nwhere he had periodically fulfilled his dreadful destiny as a Wehr-Wolf.\r\nCarefully avoiding the outskirts of the forest and the knots of large\r\ntrees, he proceeded toward the shore; and his heart was rent with\r\nfeelings of deep anguish as he everywhere beheld the traces of\r\ndestruction left behind him by his recent run in the horrible form of a\r\nsavage monster. Then, too, when melancholy thoughts had once again\r\nentered his soul, the image of Nisida appeared to flit before him in the\r\nmost tempting manner; and the more he endeavored to banish from his\r\nmemory the recollection of her charms, the more vividly delineated did\r\nthey become.\r\n\r\nAt length jealousy took possession of him;--and suddenly stopping short\r\nin his progress toward the shore, he exclaimed aloud, \"What if she\r\nshould be wooed and won by another? If she return to her native land, as\r\nassuredly she now will, she may meet some handsome and elegant cavalier\r\nwho will succeed in winning her passions:--and I--I, who love her so\r\nwell--shall be forgotten! Oh! this is madness! To think that another may\r\npossess her, clasp her in his arms, press his lips to hers, feel her\r\nfragrant breath fan his cheek, play with the rich tresses of her\r\nbeauteous hair, oh! no, no, the bare thought is enough to goad me to\r\ndespair! She must not depart thus, we have separated, if not in anger at\r\nleast abruptly, too abruptly, considering how we have loved, and that we\r\nhave wedded each other in the sight of Heaven! Heaven!\" repeated Wagner,\r\nhis tone changing from despair to a deep solemnity; \"heaven! Oh! I\r\nrejoice that I gave utterance to the word;--for it reminds me that to\r\nregain my Nisida I must lose heaven!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, as if to fly from his own reflections, he rushed on toward the sea;\r\nand there he stopped to gaze, as oft before he had gazed, on the mighty\r\nexpanse, seeming, in the liquid sunlight, as it stretched away from the\r\nyellow sand, a resplendent lake of molten silver bounded by a golden\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\"How like to the human countenance art thou, oh mighty sea!\" thought\r\nWagner, as he stood with folded arms on the brink of the eternal waters.\r\n\"Now thou hast smiles as soft and dimples as beautiful as ever appeared\r\nin the face of innocence and youth, while the joyous sunlight is on\r\nthee. But if the dark clouds gather in the heaven above thee, thou\r\nstraightway assumed a mournful and a gloomy aspect, and thou growest\r\nthreatening and somber. And in how many varied voices dost thou speak.\r\nOh, treacherous and changeful sea! Now thou whisperest softly as if thy\r\nripples conveyed faint murmurs of love;--but, if the gale arise, thou\r\ncanst burst forth into notes of laughter as thy waters leap to the shore\r\nwith bounding mirth;--and, if the wind grow higher, thou canst speak\r\nlouder and more menacingly; till, when the storm comes on, thou lashest\r\nthyself into a fury,--thou boilest with rage, and thy wrathful voice\r\nvies with the rush of the tempest and the roar of the thunder! Deceitful\r\nsea--imaging the beauties, thoughts, and passions of the earth! Within\r\nthy mighty depths, too, thou hast gems to deck the crowns of kings and\r\nthe brows of loveliness; and yet thou cravest for more--more--and\r\nengulfest rich argosies with all their treasures--thou insatiate sea!\r\nAnd in thy dark caverns are the skeletons of the myriads of human beings\r\nwhom thou hast swallowed up in thy fury; and whose bones are trophies\r\nwhich thou retainest in thy fathomless depths, as the heart of man\r\nenshrineth the relics of those hopes which have wasted away and\r\nperished!\"\r\n\r\nThus thought Wagner, as he stood gazing upon the sea, then so calm and\r\nbeautiful, but which he knew to be so treacherous. When wearied of the\r\nreflections which that scene inspired, and not daring to allow his mind\r\nto dwell upon the image of Nisida, he repaired to the nearest grove and\r\nrefreshed himself with the cooling fruits which he plucked. Then he\r\nextended his rambles amongst the verdant plains, and strove strenuously\r\nto divert his thoughts as much as possible from the one grand and\r\nmournful idea--the departure of Nisida from the island! But vainly did\r\nhe endeavor to fix his attention upon the enchanting characteristics of\r\nthat clime;--the flowers appeared to him less brilliant in hue than they\r\nwere wont to be--the fruits were less inviting--the verdure was of a\r\nless lively green--and the plumage of the birds seemed to have lost the\r\nbright gloss that rendered its colors so gorgeous in the sunlight. For,\r\noh! the powers of his vision were almost completely absorbed in his\r\nmind; and that mind was a mirror wherein was now reflected with a\r\npainful vividness all the incidents of the last few hours.\r\n\r\nBut still he was sustained in his determination not to retrace his way\r\nto the spot where he had left Nisida; and when several hours had passed,\r\nand the sun was drawing near the western horizon, he exclaimed, in a\r\nmoment of holy triumph, \"She has doubtless by this time quitted the\r\nisland, and I have been enabled to resist those anxious longings which\r\nprompted me to return and clasp her in my arms! O God! I thank thee that\r\nthou hast given me this strength!\"\r\n\r\nWagner now felt so overcome with weariness after his wanderings and\r\nroamings of so many hours, especially as the two preceding nights had\r\nbeen sleepless for him--that he sat down upon a piece of low rock near\r\nthe shore. A quiet, dreamy repose insensibly stole over him: in a few\r\nminutes his slumber was profound. And now he beheld a strange vision.\r\nGradually the darkness which appeared to surround him grew less intense;\r\nand a gauzy vapor that rose in the midst, at first of the palest bluish\r\ntint possible, by degrees obtained more consistency, when its nature\r\nbegan to undergo a sudden change, assuming the semblance of a luminous\r\nmist. Wagner's heart seemed to flutter and leap in his breast, as if\r\nwith a presentiment of coming joy; for the luminous mist became a\r\nglorious halo, surrounding the beauteous and holy form of a protecting\r\nangel, clad in white and shining garments, and with snowy wings drooping\r\nslowly from her shoulders! And ineffably--supernally benign and\r\nreassuring was the look which the angel bent upon the sleeping Wagner,\r\nas she said in the softest, most melodious tones, \"The choir of the\r\nheavenly host has hymned thanks for thy salvation! After thou hadst\r\nresisted the temptations of the enemy of mankind when he spoke to thee\r\nwith his own lips, an angel came to thee in a dream to give thee\r\nassurance that thou hadst already done much in atonement for the crime\r\nthat endangered thy soul; but he warned thee then that much more\r\nremained to be done ere that atonement would be complete. And the rest\r\nis now accomplished; for thou hast resisted the temptations of the evil\r\none when urged by the tongue and in the melodious voice of lovely woman!\r\nThis was thy crowning triumph: and the day when thou shalt reap thy\r\nreward is near at hand; for the bonds which connect thee with the\r\ndestiny of a Wehr-Wolf shall be broken, and thy name shall be inscribed\r\nin Heaven's own Book of Life! And I will give thee a sign, that what\r\nthou seest and hearest now in thy slumber is no idle and delusive vision\r\nconjured up by a fevered brain. The sign shall be this: On awaking from\r\nthy sleep, retrace thy way to the spot where this morning thou didst\r\nseparate from her whom thou lovest; and there shalt thou find a boat\r\nupon the sand. The boat will waft thee to Sicily; and there, in the town\r\nof Syracuse, thou must inquire for a man whose years have numbered one\r\nhundred and sixty-two; for that man it is who will teach thee how the\r\nspell which has made thee a Wehr-Wolf may be broken.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had the angel finished speaking, when a dark form rose suddenly\r\nnear that heavenly being; and Wagner had no difficulty in recognizing\r\nthe demon. But the enemy of mankind appeared not armed with terrors of\r\ncountenance, nor with the withering scorn of infernal triumph; for a\r\nmoment his features denoted ineffable rage--and then that expression\r\nyielded to one of the profoundest melancholy, as if he were saying\r\nwithin himself, \"There is salvation for repentant man, but none for me!\"\r\nA cloud now seemed to sweep before Wagner's eyes; denser and more dense\r\nit grew--first absorbing in its increasing obscurity the form of the\r\ndemon, and then enveloping the radiant being who still continued to\r\nsmile sweetly and benignly upon the sleeping mortal until the glorious\r\ncountenance and the shining garments were no longer visible, but all was\r\nblack darkness around. And Fernand Wagner continued to sleep profoundly.\r\n\r\nMany hours elapsed ere he woke; and his slumber was serene and soothing.\r\nAt length when he opened his eyes and slowly raised his head from the\r\nhard pillow which a mass of rock had formed, he beheld the rich red\r\nstreaks in the eastern horizon, heralding the advent of the sun; and as\r\nthe various features of the island gradually developed themselves to his\r\nview, as if breaking slowly from a mist, he collected and rearranged in\r\nhis mind all the details of the strange vision which he had seen. For a\r\nfew minutes he was oppressed with a fear that his vision would indeed\r\nprove the delusive sport of his fevered brain; for there seemed to be in\r\nits component parts a wild admixture of the sublime and the fantastic.\r\nThe solemn language of the angel appeared strangely diversified by the\r\nintimation that he would find a boat upon the shore, that this boat\r\nwould convey him to a place where he was to inquire for a man whose age\r\nwas one hundred and sixty-two years, and that this man was the being\r\ndestined to save him from the doom of a Wehr-Wolf.\r\n\r\nThen, again, he thought that heaven worked out its designs by means\r\noften inscrutable to human comprehension: and he blamed himself for\r\nhaving doubted the truth of the vision. Feelings of joy therefore\r\naccompanied the reassurance of his soul; and, having poured forth his\r\nthanksgivings for the merciful intervention of Providence in his behalf,\r\nhe tarried not even to break his fast with the fruits clustering at a\r\nshort distance from him, but hastened to retrace his way across the\r\nmountains, no longer doubting to find the sign fulfilled and the boat\r\nupon the shore. And now these thoughts rose within him. Should he again\r\nbehold Nisida? Was the fleet, which he had seen on the previous day,\r\nstill off the island? Or had it departed, bearing Nisida away to another\r\nclime?\r\n\r\nHe expected not to behold either the fleet or his loved one; for he felt\r\nconvinced that the angel would not send him back within the influence of\r\nher temptations. Nor was he mistaken, for having traversed the volcanic\r\nrange of heights, he beheld naught to break the uniform and monotonous\r\naspect of the sunlit sea. But, on drawing nearer to the shore, he saw a\r\ndark spot almost immediately in front of the little hut which Nisida and\r\nhimself had constructed, and wherein they had passed so many, many happy\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nHe now advanced with a beating heart to the hut. The door was closed.\r\nWas it possible that Nisida might be within? Oh, how weak in purpose is\r\nthe strongest minded of mortals. For an instant a pleasing hope filled\r\nWagner's breast; and then, again summoning all his resolutions to his\r\naid, he opened the door, resolved, should she indeed be there, to remain\r\nproof against all the appeals she might make to induce him to sacrifice\r\nto their mundane prosperity his immortal soul. But the hut was empty. He\r\nlingered in it for a few moments; and the reminiscences of happy hours\r\npassed therein swept across his brain. Suddenly the note which Nisida\r\nhad left for him met his eyes; and it would be representing him as\r\nsomething far more or else far less than human, were we to declare he\r\ndid not experience a feeling of intense pleasure at beholding the\r\nmemorial of her love. The tears flowed down his cheeks as he read the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n    \"The hour approaches, dearest Fernand, when, in all probability,\r\n    I shall quit the island. But think not that this hope is\r\n    unaccompanied by severe pangs. Oh, thou knowest that I love\r\n    thee, and I will return to thee, my own adored Fernand, so soon\r\n    as my presence shall be no longer needed at Florence. Yes, I\r\n    will come back to thee, and we will not part until death shall\r\n    deprive thee of _me_--for I must perish first, and while thou\r\n    still remainest in all the glory of regenerated youth. Alas,\r\n    thou hast fled from me this morning in anger--perhaps in\r\n    disgust. But thou wilt forgive me, Fernand, if, yielding to some\r\n    strange influence which I could not control, I urged an appeal\r\n    so well calculated to strike terror into thy soul. Oh, that I\r\n    could embrace thee ere I leave this isle; but alas! thou comest\r\n    not back--thou hast fled to the mountains. It is, however, in\r\n    the ardent hope of thy return to this spot, that I leave these\r\n    few lines to assure thee of my undying affection, to pledge to\r\n    thee my intention to hasten back to thine arms as soon as\r\n    possible, and to implore thee not to nourish anger against thy\r\n    devoted                                                NISIDA.\"\r\n\r\nWagner placed the letter to his lips, exclaiming, \"Oh, wherefore did an\r\nevil influence ever prove its power on thee, thou loving, loved, and\r\nbeauteous being. Why was thy hand raised against the hapless Agnes?\r\nwherefore did fate make thee a murderess--and why, oh, why didst thou\r\nassail me with prayers, tears, reproaches, menaces, to induce me to\r\nconsign my soul to Satan? Nisida, may Heaven manifest its merciful\r\ngoodness unto thee, even as that same benign care has been extended to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nFernand then placed the letter in his bosom, next to his heart, and\r\ndashing away the tears from his long lashes, began to turn his attention\r\ntoward the preparation for his own departure from the island. As he\r\napproached the pile of stores, he beheld the light drapery which Nisida\r\nhad lately worn, but which she had laid aside previous to leaving the\r\nisland; and he also observed that the rich dress, which he had often\r\nseen her examine with care, was no longer there.\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful she must have appeared in the garb!\" he murmured to\r\nhimself. \"But, alas! she returns to the great world to resume her former\r\ncharacter of the deaf and dumb.\"\r\n\r\nNisida and himself had often employed themselves in gathering quantities\r\nof those fruits which form an excellent aliment when dried in the sun;\r\nand there was a large supply of these comestibles now at his disposal.\r\nHe accordingly transferred them to the boat; then he procured a quantity\r\nof fresh fruits; and lastly he filled with pure water a cask which had\r\nbeen saved by Nisida from the corsair-wreck. His preparations were\r\nspeedily completed; and he was about to depart, when it struck him that\r\nhe might never behold Nisida again, and that she might perform her\r\npromise of returning to the island sooner or later. He accordingly\r\navailed himself of the writing materials left amongst the stores, to pen\r\na brief but affectionate note, couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    \"DEAREST NISIDA,--I have found, read, and wept over thy letter.\r\n    Thou hast my sincerest forgiveness, because I love thee more\r\n    than man ever before loved woman. Heaven has sent me the means\r\n    of escape from this island--and the doom at which my regenerated\r\n    existence was purchased, will shortly lose its spell. But\r\n    perhaps my life may be surrendered up at the same time; at all\r\n    events, everything is dark and mysterious in respect to means by\r\n    which that spell is to be broken. Should we never meet again,\r\n    but shouldst thou return hither and find this note, receive it\r\n    as a proof of the unchanging affection of thy\r\n\r\n                                                      \"FERNAND.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter was placed in the hut, in precisely the same spot where the\r\none written by Nisida had been left; and Wagner then hastened to the\r\nboat, which he had no difficulty in pushing away from the shore. Without\r\nbeing able to form any idea of the direction in which the island of\r\nSicily lay, but trusting entirely to the aid of Heaven to guide him to\r\nthe coast whither his destiny now required him to proceed, he hoisted\r\nthe sail and abandoned the boat to the gentle breeze which swept the\r\nsurface of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe state-cabins--they might more properly be called spacious\r\napartments--occupied by the Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha, on board the\r\nship of the lord high admiral, were fitted up in a most sumptuous and\r\nluxurious manner. They consisted of two large saloons in a suit, and\r\nfrom each of which opened, on either side, a number of small cabins,\r\ntenanted by the officers immediately attached to the grand vizier's\r\nperson, and the page and slaves in attendance on him.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two large saloons was lighted by a handsome conical\r\nskylight on the deck: the innermost had the advantage of the stern\r\nwindows. The drapery--the curtains, the carpets, the sofas, and the\r\nhangings were all of the richest materials; the sides and ceilings of\r\nthe cabin were beautifully painted and elaborately gilded, and the\r\nwood-work of the windows was incrusted with thin slabs of\r\nvariously-colored marbles, on which were engraved the ciphers of the\r\ndifferent lord high admirals who had hoisted their flags at any time on\r\nboard that ship. For the state-apartments which we are describing\r\nproperly belonged to the kapitan-pasha himself; but they had been\r\nsurrendered to the grand vizier, as a mark of respect to the superior\r\nrank of this minister, during his stay on board.\r\n\r\nThe little cabins communicating with the large saloons were in reality\r\nintended to accomodate the ladies of the kapitan-pasha's harem; but\r\nIbrahim did not turn them to a similar use, because it was contrary to\r\nOttoman usage for the Princess Aischa, being the sultan's sister, to\r\naccompany her husband on any expedition; and he had received so menacing\r\na warning in the fate of Calanthe not to provoke the jealousy of Aischa\r\nor the vengeance of her mother, the Sultana Valida, that he had brought\r\nnone of the ladies of his own harem with him. Indeed, since the violent\r\ndeath of Calanthe the harem had been maintained at Constantinople rather\r\nas an appendage of high rank than as a source of sensual enjoyment.\r\n\r\nNisida of Riverola was treated with the utmost deference and attention\r\nby the Grand Vizier, Ibrahim Pasha; and on reaching the lord high\r\nadmiral's ship, she was instantly conducted to the innermost saloon,\r\nwhich she was given to understand by signs would be exclusively\r\nappropriated to her own use. The slaves occupying the small cabins\r\nopening therefrom were removed to another part of the ship; and the key\r\nof the door connecting the two saloons was handed by the polite Ibrahim\r\nto the lady as a guaranty, or at least an apparent one, of the respect\r\nwith which she should be treated and the security she might hope to\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nThe fleet weighed anchor and set sail again almost immediately after the\r\nreturn of the grand vizier to the admiral's ship; and as she was wafted\r\naway from the Island of Snakes, Nisida sat at the window of her splendid\r\nsaloon gazing at the receding shores, and so strangely balancing between\r\nher anxiety to revisit Florence and her regrets at abandoning Fernand\r\nWagner, that while smiles were on her lips, tears were in her eyes, and\r\nif her bosom palpitated with joy at one moment it would heave with\r\nprofound sighs at the next.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon four male slaves entered Nisida's cabin, and spread\r\nupon the table a magnificent repast, accompanied with the most delicious\r\nwines of Cyprus and Greece--and while the lady partook slightly of the\r\nbanquet, two other slaves appeared and danced in a pleasing style for\r\nseveral minutes. They retired, but shortly returned, carrying in their\r\nhands massive silver censers, in which burnt aloes, cinnamon and other\r\nodoriferous woods diffused a delicious perfume around. The four slaves\r\nwho attended at table removed the dishes on splendid silver salvers, and\r\nthen served sherbet and a variety of delicious fruits; and when the\r\nrepast was terminated, they all withdrew, leaving Nisida once more\r\nalone. The Island of Snakes had been lost sight of for some hours, and\r\nthe fresh breeze of evening was playing upon the cheeks of the Lady\r\nNisida as she sat at the open casement of her splendid saloon, watching\r\nthe ships that followed in the wake of that in which she was, when the\r\nsounds of voices in the adjacent cabin attracted her attention; and as\r\nthe partition was but slight, and the persons discoursing spoke Italian,\r\nshe could not help overhearing the conversation which there look place,\r\neven if she had possessed any punctilious feelings to have prevented her\r\nfrom becoming a willing listener.\r\n\r\n\"The Lady Nisida is a magnificent woman, Demetrius,\" observed a voice\r\nwhich our heroine immediately recognized to be that of the grand vizier.\r\n\"Such a splendid aquiline countenance I never before beheld! Such eyes,\r\ntoo, such a delicious mouth, and such brilliant teeth! What a pity 'tis\r\nthat she has not the use of her tongue! The voice of such a glorious\r\ncreature, speaking mine own dear Italian language, would be music\r\nitself. And how admirably is she formed--upon somewhat too large a\r\nscale, perhaps, to precisely suit my taste, and yet the contours of her\r\nshape are so well rounded--so perfectly proportioned in the most\r\nharmonious symmetry, that were she less of the Hebe she would be less\r\ncharming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your highness already enamored of Donna Nisida?\" asked the person to\r\nwhom the grand vizier had addressed the preceding observations.\r\n\r\n\"I must confess that I am, Demetrius,\" replied Ibrahim; \"I would give a\r\nyear of my life to become her favored lover for one day. But considering\r\nthat I hope to see my sister Flora become the wife of Donna Nisida's\r\nbrother Francisco, I must restrain this passion of mine within due\r\nbounds. But wherefore do you sigh thus heavily, Demetrius?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my lord, the mention you make of your sister reminded me that I\r\nonce possessed a sister also,\" returned the Greek in a plaintive tone.\r\n\"But when I returned to Constantinople, I sought vainly for her, and\r\nHeaven knows what has become of her, and whether I shall ever see her\r\nmore. Poor Calanthe! some treachery has doubtless been practiced toward\r\nthee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give way to despair, Demetrius,\" said the grand vizier. \"Who\r\nknows but Calanthe may have espoused some youth on whom her affections\r\nwere set----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my lord!\" interrupted the Greek, \"it is considerate--it is kind on\r\nthe part of your highness to suggest such a consolatory belief; but\r\nCalanthe would not keep an honorable bridal secret. Yet better were it\r\nthat she should be dead--that she should have been basely murdered by\r\nsome ruthless robber, than that she should live dishonored. However, I\r\nwill not intrude my griefs upon your highness, although the friendship\r\nand the condescension which your highness manifests toward me, emboldens\r\nme to mention these sorrows in your presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that I could really console thee, Demetrius,\" answered Ibrahim,\r\nwith well-affected sincerity; \"for thou hast shown thyself a sincere\r\nfriend to my poor sister Flora. And now that we are alone together,\r\nDemetrius, for almost the first time since this hastily undertaken\r\nvoyage began, let us recapitulate in detail all the occurrences which\r\nhave led me to enter upon the present expedition the real nature of\r\nwhich you alone know, save my imperial master. And, moreover, let us\r\ncontinue to discourse in Italian; for thou canst speak that language\r\nmore fluently than I can express myself in thy native Greek; besides, it\r\nrejoices my heart,\" he added with a sigh, \"to converse in a tongue so\r\ndear as that of the land which gave me birth. And, if Donna Nisida only\r\nknew that in the representative of the mighty Solyman she had beholden\r\nthe brother of her late menial, Flora, how surprised would she be!\"\r\n\r\n\"And it were not prudent that she should learn that fact, my lord!\"\r\nobserved Demetrius, \"for more reasons than one; since from sundry hints\r\nwhich the Signora Francatelli, your lordship's worthy aunt, dropped to\r\nme, it is easy to believe that the Donna Nisida was averse to the\r\nattachment which her brother Francisco had formed, and that her ladyship\r\nindeed was the means of consigning your highness' sister to the convent\r\nof the Carmelites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albeit I shall not treat Count Francisco's sister the less worthily,\r\nnow that she is in my power,\" said Ibrahim Pasha; \"indeed, her matchless\r\nbeauty would command my forbearance, were I inclined to be vindictive.\r\nMoreover, deaf and dumb as she is, she could not obtain the least\r\ninsight into my plans; and therefore she is unable to thwart them.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may suppose that not one single word of all this conversation\r\nwas lost upon Nisida, who had indeed learnt, with the most unbounded\r\nwonderment, that the high and mighty grand vizier of the Ottoman\r\nEmpire--a man enjoying an almost sovereign rank, and who bore a title\r\nwhich placed him on a level with the greatest princes of Christendom,\r\nwas the brother of the detested Flora Francatelli! During a short pause\r\nwhich ensued in the dialogue between Ibrahim Pasha and his Greek\r\nconfidant, Nisida stole gently up to the door in the partitions between\r\nthe two saloons, so fearful was she of losing a single word of a\r\ndiscourse that so deeply interested and nearly concerned her.\r\n\r\n\"But, as I was saying ere now, Demetrius,\" resumed the grand vizier,\r\nwho, young as he was, had acquired all the methodical habits of a wise\r\nstatesman, \"let us examine in detail the whole posture of affairs in\r\nFlorence, so that I may maturely consider the precise bearings of the\r\ncase, and finally determine how to act. For, although I have at my\r\ndisposal a fleet which might cope with even that of enterprising England\r\nor imperious France, though twenty thousand well-disciplined soldiers on\r\nboard these ships are ready to draw the sword at my nod, and though, as\r\nthe seraskier and sipehsalar of the armies of the sultan, I am\r\nresponsible for my actions to his majesty alone, yet it is not a small\r\nthing, Demetrius, to march an invading force into the heart of Italy,\r\nand thereby risk a war with all Christendom. Therefore, let us pause to\r\nreflect upon every detail of all those incidents which occurred two\r\nmonths ago at Florence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good, my lord,\" said Demetrius. \"I will therefore begin with my arrival\r\nin that fair city, to which I repaired with all possible dispatch, as\r\nsoon as I had received the instructions of your highness. It would\r\nappear that the Lord Count of Riverola reached Florence the same day as\r\nmyself, he having been detained at the outset of his voyage home from\r\nRhodes by contrary winds and a severe storm. It was somewhat late in the\r\nevening when I called at the cottage of the Signora Francatelli, your\r\nhighness' worthy aunt; for I previously passed a few hours in\r\ninstituting by indirect means as many inquiries concerning her\r\ncircumstances and welfare as could be prudently made. To my grief,\r\nhowever, I could not ascertain any tidings concerning your highness'\r\nsister; and I therefore came to the mournful conclusion that her\r\ndisappearance still remained unaccounted for. Pondering upon the sad\r\ntidings which, in this respect, I should have to forward to your\r\nhighness, and having already devised a fitting tale whereby to introduce\r\nmyself to your lordship's aunt, I went to the cottage, which, as I heard\r\nin the course of a subsequent conversation, Don Francisco of Riverola\r\nhad just quitted. Your highness' aunt received me with as much\r\ncordiality as she could well show toward a stranger. Then, in accordance\r\nwith my pre-arranged method of procedure, I stated I was sent by a son\r\nof a debtor to the estate of the late Signor Francatelli, to repay to\r\nany of his surviving relations a large sum of money which had been so\r\nlong--so very long owing, and the loss of which at the time had mainly\r\ncontributed to plunge Signor Francatelli into embarrassment. I added\r\nthat the son of the debtor having grown rich, had deemed it an act of\r\nduty and honor to liquidate this liability on the part of his deceased\r\nfather. My tale was believed; the case of jewels, which I had previously\r\ncaused to be estimated by a goldsmith in Florence, was received as the\r\nmeans of settling the fictitious debt; and I was forthwith a welcome\r\nfriend at the worthy lady's table.\"\r\n\r\n\"The stratagem was a good one, Demetrius,\" observed the grand vizier.\r\n\"But proceed, and fear not that thou wilt weary me with lengthened\r\ndetails.\"\r\n\r\n\"I stayed to partake of the evening repast,\" continued the Greek; \"and\r\nthe Signora Francatelli grew confiding and communicative, as was nothing\r\nmore than natural, inasmuch as I necessarily appeared in the light of\r\nthe agent of a worthy and honorable man who had not forgotten the\r\nobligation to a family that had suffered by his father's conduct. I\r\nassured the signora that the person by whom I was employed to liquidate\r\nthat debt, would be rejoiced to hear of the success of the Francatellis,\r\nand I ventured to make inquiries concerning the orphan children of the\r\nlate merchant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proceed, Demetrius,\" said the grand vizier, \"spare not a single\r\ndetail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness shall be obeyed,\" returned the Greek, though now speaking\r\nwith considerable diffidence. \"The worthy lady shook her head\r\nmournfully, observing that Alessandro, the son of the late merchant, was\r\nin Turkey, she believed; and then she rose hastily, and opening a door\r\nleading to a staircase, called her niece to descend, as 'there was only\r\na friend present.' I was overjoyed to learn thus unexpectedly, that the\r\nSignora Flora had reappeared; and when she entered the room, could\r\nscarcely conceal my delight beneath that aspect of mere cold courtesy\r\nwhich it became a stranger to wear. The young lady appeared perfectly\r\nhappy, and no wonder! For when she had retired, after staying a few\r\nminutes in the room, her good aunt, in the fullness of her confidence in\r\nme, not only related all the particulars of the Signora Flora's\r\nimmurement in the Carmelite Convent, but also explained to me her\r\nmotives for so long concealing the young lady's return home, as I have\r\nheretofore narrated to your highness. The worthy aunt then informed me\r\nthat the Count of Riverola had only returned that day from the\r\nwars--that he had made honorable proposals to her on behalf of the\r\nSignora Flora--and that it was intended to sustain the mystery which\r\nveiled the young lady's existence and safety in the cottage, until the\r\nmarriage should have been privately effected, when it would be too late\r\nfor the count's friends to interfere or renew their persecutions against\r\nyour lordship's sister. Your highness' aunt dropped hints intimating her\r\nsuspicion that the Lady Nisida was the principal, if not indeed the sole\r\nmeans of those persecutions which had consigned the innocent young\r\nmaiden to the Carmelite Convent. And the more I reflect on this point,\r\nin view of all I know of the affairs, and of Donna Nisida's strange and\r\nresolute character, the more I am convinced that she really perpetrated\r\nthat diabolical outrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were it not for young Francisco's sake, and that I should bring\r\ndishonor into a family with which my sister will, I hope, be soon\r\nconnected with marriage ties,\" exclaimed Ibrahim, \"I would avenge myself\r\nand my sister's wrongs by forcing the cruel Nisida to yield herself to\r\nmy arms. But no, it must not be.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nisida, who overheard every syllable, curled her lips, while her\r\neyes flashed fire at the dark menace which the renegade had dared to\r\nutter, qualified though it were by the avowal of the motive which would\r\nprevent him from putting it into execution.\r\n\r\n\"No, it must not be,\" repeated Ibrahim. \"And yet, she is so wondrously\r\nbeautiful that I would risk a great deal to win her love. But proceed,\r\nDemetrius--we now come to that portion of the narrative which so nearly\r\nconcerns my present proceedings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my lord, and God give your highness success!\" exclaimed the young\r\nGreek. \"Having taken leave of your excellent aunt, who invited me to\r\nvisit her again, as I had casually observed that business would detain\r\nme in Florence for some time, and having promised the strictest secrecy\r\nrelative to all she had told me, I repaired to the inn at which I had\r\nput up, intending to devote the next day to writing the details of all\r\nthose particulars which I have just related, and which I purposed to\r\nsend by some special messenger to your highness. But it then struck me\r\nthat I should only attract undue attention to myself by conducting at a\r\npublic tavern a correspondence having so important an aspect, and I\r\naccordingly rose very early in the morning to sally forth to seek after\r\na secluded but respectable lodging, I eventually obtained suitable\r\napartments in the house of a widow named Dame Margaretha, and there I\r\nimmediately took up my abode. Having written my letters to your\r\nhighness, I was anxious to get them expedited to Constantinople, for I\r\nwas well aware that your highness would be rejoiced to hear that your\r\nbeloved sister was indeed in the land of the living, that she was in\r\ngood health, and that a brilliant marriage was in store for her. I\r\naccordingly spoke to Dame Margaretha relative to the means of obtaining\r\na trusty messenger who would undertake a journey to Constantinople. The\r\nold woman assured me that her son Antonio, who was a valet in the\r\nservice of the Count of Arestino, would be able to procure me such a\r\nmessenger as I desired, and in the course of the day that individual was\r\nfetched by his mother to speak to me on the subject. Having repeated my\r\nwishes to him, he asked me several questions which seemed to indicate a\r\nprying disposition, and a curiosity as impertinent as it was\r\ninconvenient. In fact, I did not like his manner at all; but conceiving\r\nthat his conduct might arise from sheer ignorance, and from no sinister\r\nmotive, I still felt inclined to avail myself of his assistance to\r\nprocure a messenger. Finding that he could not sift me, he at length\r\nsaid that he had no doubt a friend of his, whom he named Venturo, would\r\nundertake my commission, and he promised to return with that individual\r\nin the evening. He then left me, and true to his promise, he came back\r\nshortly after dusk, accompanied by this same Venturo. The bargain was\r\nsoon struck between us, and he promised to set off that very night for\r\nRimini, whence vessels were constantly sailing for Constantinople. I\r\ngave him a handsome sum in advance, and also a sealed packet, addressed\r\nto your highness' private secretary, but containing an inclosure, also\r\nwell sealed, directed to your highness, for I did not choose to excite\r\nthe curiosity of these Italians by allowing them to discover that I was\r\ncorresponding with the grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire, Venturo\r\naccordingly left me, promising to acquit himself faithfully of his\r\nmission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your plans were all wisely taken,\" said the grand vizier, \"and no human\r\nforesight could have anticipated other than successful results. Proceed,\r\nfor although you have hastily sketched all these particulars to me\r\nbefore, yet I am anxious to consider them in more attentive detail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having thus disposed of that important business,\" resumed the young\r\nGreek, \"I went out to saunter through the streets of Florence, and while\r\naway an hour or two in viewing the splendid appearance of that charming\r\ncity, when lighted up with the innumerable lamps of its palaces and\r\ncasinos. At length I entered a dark and obscure street, which I knew\r\nmust lead toward the river. I had not proceeded far down the street when\r\nI heard the sound of many steps rapidly approaching, as if of a patrol.\r\nI stepped aside under a deep archway, but as chance would have it, they\r\nstopped short within a few paces of the spot where I was shrouded in the\r\nutter obscurity of the arch. I should have immediately passed on my way,\r\nbut was induced to stop by hearing a voice which I recognized to be that\r\nof Venturo, whom I believed to be already some miles away from Florence.\r\nI was perfectly astounded at this discovery, and if I had entertained\r\nany doubts as to the identity of that voice, they were speedily cleared\r\nup by the conversation between the men. 'We had better separate here,'\r\nsaid Venturo, 'and break into at least two parties, as at the bottom of\r\nthis street we shall come within the blaze of the lights of the casinos\r\non the Arno's bank.' 'Well spoken,' returned a voice which, to my\r\nincreasing wonder, I recognized to be that of Antonio, my landlady's\r\nson; 'you and I, Venturo, will keep together, and our friends can go on\r\nfirst. We will follow them in a few minutes, and then unite again at the\r\nangle of the grove nearest to Dame Francatelli's cottage. What say you,\r\nLomellino?' 'Just as you think fit, Antonio,' returned a third person,\r\nwhom I naturally concluded to be the individual addressed as Lomellino.\r\n'You, or rather your master, the Count of Arestino, pays for this\r\nbusiness, and so I am bound to obey you.' 'Listen, then,' resumed\r\nAntonio, 'the young Count of Riverola, whom I have traced to the cottage\r\nthis evening, will no doubt be coming away about the time we shall all\r\nmeet down there; and therefore we shall have nothing to do but to carry\r\nhim off to the cave.' 'Why is the Count of Arestino so hostile to young\r\nRiverola?' demanded the man who had answered to the name of Lomellino.\r\n'He cares nothing about young Riverola, either one way or the other,'\r\nreplied Antonio, 'but I have persuaded his lordship that if Francisco be\r\nleft at large, he will only use his influence to mitigate the vengeance\r\nof the law against the Countess Giulia, who is the friend of Flora\r\nFrancatelli: and so the Count of Arestino has consented to follow my\r\nadvice and have Francisco locked up until the inquisition has dealt with\r\nthe countess, her lover, the Marquis of Orsini, and the Francatellis,\r\naunt and niece.' 'Then you have a spite against this man,' said\r\nLomellino. 'Truly have I,' responded Antonio. 'You remember that night\r\nwhen you, with Stephano Verrina and Piero, got into the Riverola Palace\r\nsome months ago? Well, I don't know who discovered the plot, but I was\r\nlocked in my room, and next morning young Francisco dismissed me in a\r\nway that made me his mortal enemy: and I must have vengeance. For this\r\npurpose I have urged on the count to cause Flora Francatelli, whom\r\nFrancisco loves and wishes to marry, to be included in the proceedings\r\ntaken by the inquisition at his lordship's instigation against the\r\nCountess Giulia and the Marquis d'Orsini; and the old aunt must\r\nnecessarily be thrown in, into the bargain, for harboring sacrilegious\r\npersons.' 'And so young Francisco is to lose his mistress, Flora, and be\r\nkept a prisoner in the cavern till he has been condemned along with the\r\nothers?' said Lomellino. 'Neither more nor less than what you imagine,\r\nand I only wish I had the Lady Nisida also in my power, for I have no\r\ndoubt she instigated her brother to turn me off suddenly like a common\r\nthief, because from all you have since told me, Lomellino, I dare swear\r\nit was she who got an inkling of our intentions to plunder the Riverola\r\nPalace; though how she could have done so, being deaf and dumb, passes\r\nmy understanding.' 'Well, well,' growled Lomellino, 'it is no use to\r\nwaste time talking of the past: let us only think of the present. Come,\r\nmy men, we will go on first, as already agreed.' Three or four armed\r\nruffians then put themselves in motion, passing close by the place where\r\nI was concealed, but fortunately without discovering my presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! those miscreants would have assuredly murdered you, my faithful\r\nDemetrius,\" said the grand vizier.\r\n\r\n\"Of that, my lord, there is little doubt,\" returned the young Greek;\r\n\"and I must confess that I shuddered more than once while listening to\r\nthe discourse of the cold-blooded monsters. But Venturo and Antonio\r\nstill remained behind for a few minutes, and the discourse which took\r\nplace between them, gave me a still further insight into the characters\r\nof the gang. 'Well, Venturo,' said Antonio, after a short pause, 'have\r\nyou examined the packet which was intrusted to you?' 'I have, and the\r\ncontents are written in Greek or Arabic, or some such outlandish tongue,\r\nfor I could not read a word of them,' answered Venturo; 'and so I\r\nthought the best plan was to destroy them.' 'You acted wisely,' observed\r\nAntonio; 'by the saints! it was a good thought of mine to introduce you\r\nto my mother's lodger as a trustworthy messenger! If he only knew that\r\nwe had shared his gold, and were laughing at him for his credulity, he\r\nwould not be over well pleased. His purse appears to be pretty well\r\nlined, and when we have got all our present business off our hands we\r\nwill devote our attention to the lodger. The Arno is deep and a\r\nforeigner the less in the city will not be noticed.' 'Not at all,'\r\nanswered Venturo; 'but let us now hasten to join our companions. At what\r\ntime are the officers of the inquisition to visit the cottage?' 'They\r\nare no doubt already in the neighborhood,' replied Antonio, 'and will\r\npounce upon their victims as soon as young Francisco leaves the place.\r\nAnother set of officers are after the Marquis of Orsini.' The two\r\nmiscreants then departed, continuing their conversation in a low tone as\r\nthey went along the street, but I overheard no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wretches!\" exclaimed the grand vizier, in an excited voice. \"But\r\nvengeance will light upon them yet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven grant that they may not go unpunished!\" said Demetrius. \"Your\r\nhighness may imagine the consternation with which I had listened to the\r\ndevelopment of the damnable plots then in progress; but I nevertheless\r\nexperienced a material solace in the fact that accident had thus\r\nrevealed to me the whole extent of the danger which menaced those whom\r\nyour highness held dear. Without pausing to deliberate, I resolved, at\r\nall risks, to proceed at once to the cottage, and, if not too late, warn\r\nyour aunt and lovely sister of the terrible danger which menaced them.\r\nNay, more--I determined to remove them immediately from Florence--that\r\nvery night--without an unnecessary moment's delay. Darting along the\r\nstreets, as if my speed involved matters of life and death, I succeeded\r\nin passing the two villains, Venturo and Antonio, before they had\r\nentered the sphere of the brilliant illuminations of the casinos in the\r\nvale of Arno; and I beard one say to the other, 'There's some cowardly\r\nknave who has just done a deed of which he is no doubt afraid.'\r\nConvinced by this remark that they suspected not who the person that\r\npassed them so rapidly was, I hurried on with increasing speed, and\r\nlikewise with augmented hope to be enabled to save not only your\r\nlordship's aunt and sister from the officers of the inquisition, but\r\nalso the young Count of Riverola from the power of his miscreant\r\nenemies. Alas! my anticipations were not to be fulfilled! I lost my way\r\namongst a maze of gardens connected with the villas bordering on the\r\nArno; and much valuable time at such a crisis was wasted in the circuits\r\nwhich I had to make to extricate myself from the labyrinth and reach the\r\nbank of the river. At length I drew within sight of the cottage; but my\r\nheart beat with terrible alarms as I beheld lights moving rapidly about\r\nthe house. 'It is too late,' I thought: and yet I rushed on toward the\r\nplace. But suddenly the door opened, and by a glare of light within, I\r\nsaw three females closely muffled in veils, led forth by several armed\r\nmen. It instantly struck me that the third must be the Countess Giulia\r\nof Arestino to whom I heard the miscreants allude. I stopped short--for\r\nI knew that any violent demonstration or interference on my part would\r\nbe useless, and that measures of another kind must be adopted on behalf\r\nof the victims. As the procession now advanced from a cottage, I\r\nconcealed myself in the adjacent grove, wondering whether Count\r\nFrancisco had been already arrested or whether he had managed to elude\r\nhis enemies. The procession, consisting of the officers of the\r\ninquisition with their three female prisoners, who were dragged rather\r\nthan led along, passed by the spot where I lay concealed; and the deep\r\nsobs which came from the unfortunate ladies, gagged though they\r\nevidently were, filled my heart with horror and anguish. As soon as they\r\nhad disappeared I struck further into the grove, knowing by its\r\nsituation that the outlet on the other side would conduct me to the\r\nnearest road to that quarter of the city in which I lodged. But scarcely\r\nhad I reached the outskirts of the little wood in the direction which I\r\nhave named, when I saw a party of men moving on in front of me, through\r\nthe obscurity of the night. It struck me that this party might consist\r\nof Antonio, Venturo, and other worthies, and I determined to ascertain\r\nwhether Count Francisco had fallen into their hands. I accordingly\r\nfollowed them as cautiously as possible, taking care to skirt the grove\r\nin such a manner that I was concealed by its deep shade, whereas those\r\nwhom I was watching proceeded further away from the trees. Thus the\r\nparty in advance and myself continued our respective paths for nearly a\r\nquarter of an hour, during which I ascertained beyond all doubt that the\r\nmen whom I was following were really the villains of the Antonio gang,\r\nand that they had a prisoner with them who could be no other than the\r\nCount of Riverola.\r\n\r\n\"At length the grove terminated, and I was about to abandon further\r\npursuit as dangerous, when it struck me that I should be acting in a\r\ncowardly and unworthy manner not to endeavor to ascertain the locality\r\nof the cave of which I had heard the miscreants speak, and to which they\r\nwere most probably conveying him who was so dear to the beautiful\r\nSignora Flora. Accordingly I managed to track the party across several\r\nfields to a grove of evergreens. But as they advanced without caring how\r\nthey broke through the crackling thickets, the noise of their movements\r\nabsorbed the far fainter sounds which accompanied my progress. So\r\nsuccessful was my undertaking that I was soon within twenty paces of\r\nthem. But it was profoundly dark, and I was unable to observe their\r\nmovements. I computed the distance they were from me, and calculated so\r\nas to form an idea of the exact spot where they were standing; for, by\r\nan observation which one of the villains let drop, I learnt that they\r\nhad reached the entrance of their cavern. It also struck me that I heard\r\na bell ring as if in the depths of the earth, and I concluded that this\r\nwas a signal to obtain admittance. While I was weighing these matters in\r\nmy mind, Lomellino suddenly exclaimed, 'Let the prisoner be taken down\r\nfirst; and have a care, Venturo, that the bandage is well fastened.'\r\n'All right, captain,' was the reply; and thus I ascertained that\r\nLomellino was the chief of some band most probably, I thought, of\r\nrobbers; for I remembered the allusions which had been made that evening\r\nby Antonio to a certain predatory visit some months previously to the\r\nRiverola mansion. 'God help Francisco,' I said within myself, as I\r\nreflected upon the desperate character of the men who had him in their\r\npower; and then I was consoled by the remembrance that he was merely to\r\nbe detained as a prisoner for a period, and not harmed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately such demons as those Florentine banditti are capable of\r\nevery atrocity,\" observed the grand vizier.\r\n\r\n\"True, my lord,\" observed Demetrius; \"but let us hope that all those in\r\nwhom your highness is interested, will yet be saved. I shall, however,\r\ncontinue my narrative. Three or four minutes had elapsed since the\r\nrobbers had come to a full stop, when I knew by the observations made\r\namongst them, that they were descending into some subterranean place. I\r\naccordingly waited with the utmost anxiety until I was convinced that\r\nthey had all disappeared with their prisoner; and then I crept\r\ncautiously along to the place at which I had already reckoned them to\r\nhave paused. I stooped down, and carefully felt upon the ground, until I\r\nwas enabled to ascertain the precise point at which the marks of their\r\nfootsteps had ceased. At this moment the moon shone forth with such\r\nextreme brilliancy, that its beams penetrated the thick foliage; and I\r\nnow observed with horror that I had advanced to the very verge of a\r\nsteep precipice, on the brink of which the grove suddenly ceased. Had\r\nnot the moon thus providentially appeared at that instant, I should have\r\ncontinued to grope about in the utter darkness, and have assuredly\r\nfallen into the abyss. I breathed a fervent prayer for this signal\r\ndeliverance. But not a trace of any secret entrance to a cavern could I\r\nfind--no steps, no trap-door! Well aware that it would be dangerous for\r\nme to be caught in that spot, should any of the banditti emerge suddenly\r\nfrom their cave, I was reluctantly compelled to depart. But before I\r\nquitted the place, I studied it so well that I should have no difficulty\r\nin recognizing it again. In fact, just at the precise spot where the\r\nfootsteps of the banditti ceased, an enormous chestnut tree, which for\r\nmore than a century must have continued to draw from the earth its\r\nnourishment, slopes completely over the precipice, while on the right of\r\nthis tree, as you face the abyss, is a knot of olives, and on the left\r\nan umbrageous lime. These features of the spot I committed to memory,\r\nwith the idea that such a clew to the robbers' retreat might not\r\neventually prove useless.\r\n\r\n\"I will extirpate that nest of vipers--that horde of remorseless\r\nbanditti!\" exclaimed Ibrahim Pasha, in a tone indicative of strong\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness has the power,\" responded Demetrius; \"but the Florentine\r\nauthorities must be completely impotent in respect to such a formidable\r\nhorde of lawless men. The remainder of my narrative is soon told, my\r\nlord,\" returned the young Greek. \"I returned to my lodgings in safety,\r\nbut determined not to remain there a single hour longer than necessary.\r\nFor apart from the resolve which I had formed already, in consequence of\r\nthe various and unforeseen incidents which had occurred, to return to\r\nConstantinople, the murderous designs of Antonio and Venturo in respect\r\nto myself, would have hastened my removal at all events to another\r\nlodging. That night sleep never visited my eyes--so amazed and grieved\r\nwas I at the calamities which had befallen those who were so dear to\r\nyour highness. Very early in the morning I arose from a feverish bed and\r\nsallied forth to learn tidings of the Marquis of Orsini. 'For,' thought\r\nI, 'if this nobleman has escaped arrest by the officers of the\r\ninquisition, he might be enabled to effect somewhat in aiding the female\r\nvictims.' But I heard at his dwelling that he had been arrested the\r\nprevious evening on a charge of sacrilege, perpetrated with others, in\r\nrespect to the Carmelite Convent. Frustrated in this quarter, I repaired\r\nto the principal clerk of the criminal tribunal, and inquired the name\r\nand address of a lawyer of eminence and repute. The clerk complied with\r\nmy demand, and recommended me to Angelo Duras, the brother of a\r\ncelebrated Florentine physician.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both of whom are known to me by name,\" observed the grand vizier; \"and\r\nAngelo Duras is a man of unblemished integrity. It delights me much to\r\nknow you employed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I found him, too,\" continued Demetrius, \"a kind-hearted and benevolent\r\nman. He received me with affability; and I narrated to him as much as\r\nnecessary of the particulars which I have detailed to your highness.\r\nWithout stating by whom I was employed, I merely represented to him that\r\nI was deeply interested in the Francatelli family, and that it was of\r\nthe utmost importance to obtain a delay for two or three months in the\r\ncriminal proceedings instituted against those innocent females, as, in\r\nthe meantime, I should undertake a journey to a place at some\r\nconsiderable distance, but the result of which would prove materially\r\nbeneficial to the cause of the accused. He observed that the interest of\r\nthe Count of Arestino, who would doubtless endeavor to hasten the\r\nproceedings in order to wreak speedy vengeance upon his wife and the\r\nMarquis of Orsini, was very powerful to contend against; but that gold\r\ncould accomplish much. I assured him that there would be no lack of\r\nfunds to sustain even the most expensive process; and I threw down a\r\nheavy purse as an earnest of my ability to bear the cost of the suit. He\r\ncommitted to paper all the particulars that I had thought it prudent to\r\nreveal to him, and after some consideration, said, 'I now see my way\r\nclearly. I will undertake that the final hearing of this case, at least\r\nso far as it regards the Francatellis, shall be postponed for three\r\nmonths. You may rely upon the fulfillment of this promise, let the Count\r\nof Arestino do his worst.' Thus assured, I quitted the worthy pleader,\r\nand proceeded to visit Father Marco, who, as I had happened to learn\r\nwhen in conversation with your highness' aunt, was the family confessor.\r\nI found that excellent man overwhelmed with grief at the calamities\r\nwhich had occurred; and to him I confided, under a solemn promise of\r\ninviolable secrecy, who the present grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire\r\nreally was, and how I had been employed by you to visit Florence for the\r\npurpose of watching over the safety of your relatives. I however\r\nexplained to Father Marco that his vow of secrecy was to cease to be\r\nbinding at any moment when the lives of the Francatellis should be\r\nmenaced by circumstances that might possibly arise in spite of all the\r\nprecautions that I had adopted to postpone the final hearing of their\r\ncase; and that should imminent peril menace those lives, he was\r\nimmediately to reveal to the Duke of Florence the fact of the\r\nrelationship of the Francatellis with one who has power to punish any\r\ninjury that might be done to them. Though well knowing, my lord, the\r\nobstinancy of the Christian states in venturing to beard Ottoman might,\r\nI considered this precaution to be at all events a prudent one; and\r\nFather Marco promised to obey my injunctions in all respects.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not mistaken in thee, Demetrius,\" said the grand vizier, \"when I\r\nchose thee for that mission on account of thy discreetness and\r\nforesight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness' praises are my best reward,\" answered the Greek. \"I have\r\nnow done all that I could possibly effect or devise under the\r\ncircumstances which prompted me to think or act; and it grieved me that\r\nI was unable to afford the slightest assistance to the young Count of\r\nRiverola. But I dare not wait longer in Italy; and I was convinced that\r\nthe authorities in Florence were too inefficient to root out the horde\r\nof banditti, even had I explained to them the clew which I myself\r\nobtained to the stronghold of those miscreants. I accordingly quitted\r\nFlorence in the afternoon of the day following the numerous arrests\r\nwhich I have mentioned; and had I not been detained so long at Rimini,\r\nby adverse winds, your highness would not have been kept for so many\r\nweeks without the mournful tidings which it was at length my painful\r\nduty to communicate in person to your lordship.\"\r\n\r\n\"That delay, my faithful Demetrius,\" said the grand vizier, \"was no\r\nfault of thine. Fortunately the squadron was already equipped for sea;\r\nand, instead of repairing to the African frontier to chastise the daring\r\npirates, it is on its way to the Tuscan coast, where, if need be, it\r\nwill land twenty thousand soldiers to liberate my relations and the\r\nyoung Count of Riverola. A pretext for making war upon the Italian\r\nstates has been afforded by their recent conduct in sending auxiliaries\r\nto the succor of Rhodes; and of that excuse I shall not hesitate to\r\navail myself to commence hostilities against the proud Florentines\r\nshould a secret and peaceful negotiation fail. But now that thou hast\r\nrecapitulated to me all those particulars which thou didst merely sketch\r\nforth at first, it seems to me fitting that I anchor the fleet at the\r\nmouth of the Arno, and that I send thee, Demetrius, as an envoy in a\r\npublic capacity, but in reality to stipulate privately for the release\r\nof those in whom I am interested.\"\r\n\r\nThus terminated the conference between Ibrahim Pasha and his Greek\r\ndependent--a conference which had revealed manifold and astounding\r\noccurrences to the ears of the Lady Nisida of Riverola. Astounding\r\nindeed! Francisco in the hands of the formidable banditti--Flora in the\r\nprison of the inquisition--and the Ottoman grand vizier bent upon\r\neffecting the marriage which Nisida abhorred--these tidings were\r\nsufficient to arouse all the wondrous energies of that mind which was so\r\nprompt in combining intrigues and plots, so resolute in carrying them\r\nout, and so indomitable when it had formed a will of its own.\r\n\r\nOminous were the fires which flashed in her large dark eyes, and\r\npowerful were the workings of those emotions which caused her heaving\r\nbosom to swell as if about to burst the bodice which confined it, when,\r\nretreating from the partition floor between the two saloons, and\r\nresuming her seat at the cabin-windows to permit the evening breeze to\r\nfan her fevered cheek, Nisida thought within herself, \"It was indeed\r\ntime that I should quit that accursed island, and return to Italy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe roseate streaks which the departing glories of a Mediterranean\r\nsunset left lingering for a few minutes in the western horizon, were\r\nyielding to the deeper gloom of evening, a few days after the scene\r\nrelated in the preceding chapter, as Nisida rose from her seat at the\r\nopen windows of her splendid saloon on board the Ottoman Admiral's ship,\r\nand began to lay aside her apparel, preparatory to retiring to rest. She\r\nwas already wearied of the monotonous life of ship-board; and the\r\nstrange revelations which the discourse between Ibrahim Pasha and\r\nDemetrius had developed to her ears, rendered her doubly anxious to set\r\nfoot upon her native soil.\r\n\r\nThe grand vizier had paid his respects to her every day since she first\r\nembarked on board the Turkish ship; and they exchanged a few\r\nobservations, rather of courtesy than in any deeper interest, by means\r\nof the tablets. Ibrahim's manner toward her was respectful; but when he\r\nimagined himself to be unperceived by her, his eyes were suddenly\r\nlighted up with the fires of ardent passion; and he devoured her with\r\nhis burning glances. She failed not to notice the effect which her\r\nglorious beauty produced upon him, and she studiously avoided the\r\nimprudence of giving him the least encouragement; not from any innate\r\nfeeling of virtue, but because she detested him as a man who was bent on\r\naccomplishing a marriage between her brother and Flora Francatelli. This\r\nhatred she concealed, and even the eagle-sighted Ibrahim perceived not\r\nthat he was in any way displeasing to the lovely Nisida. With the\r\nexception of the grand vizier, and the slaves who waited upon her, the\r\nlady saw no one on board the ship; for she never quitted the saloon\r\nallotted to her, but passed her time chiefly in surveying the broad sea\r\nand the other vessels of the fleet from the windows, or in meditating\r\nupon the course which she should pursue on her arrival in Florence.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the thread of our narrative. The last tints of the\r\nsunset were, we said, fading away, when the Lady Nisida commenced her\r\npreparations for retiring to rest. She closed the casements, satisfied\r\nherself that the partition door between the two saloons was well\r\nsecured, and then threw herself upon the voluptuous couch spread in one\r\nof the smaller cabins opening from her own magnificent apartment. She\r\nthought of Fernand, her handsome Fernand, whom she had abandoned on the\r\nIsle of Snakes, and profound sighs escaped her. Then she thought of\r\nFrancisco; and the idea of serving that much-beloved brother's interests\r\nafforded her a consolation for having thus quitted the clime where she\r\nhad passed so many happy days with Wagner.\r\n\r\nAt length sleep fell upon her, and closed over the large, dark,\r\nbrilliant eyes the white lids, beneath the transparent skin of which the\r\nblue veins were so delicately traced; and the long, jetty lashes reposed\r\non the cheeks which the heat of the atmosphere tinged with a rich\r\ncarnation glow. And when the moon arose that night, its silver rays\r\nstreamed through the window set in the porthole of that small cabin,\r\nupon the beauteous face of the sleeper.\r\n\r\nBut hark! there is the light sound of a footfall in the saloon from\r\nwhich that cabin opens.\r\n\r\nThe treacherous Ibrahim possesses a key to the partition door; and\r\nhaving successfully wrestled with his raging desires until this moment,\r\nhe is at length no longer able to resist the temptation of invading the\r\nsanctity of Nisida's sleeping-place. Already has he set his foot upon\r\nthe very threshold of the little side-cabin, having traversed the\r\nspacious saloon, when a hand is laid upon his shoulder, and a voice\r\nbehind him says in a low tone, \"Your highness has forgotten the fate of\r\nthe murdered Calanthe.\"\r\n\r\nIbrahim started, shook the hand from off him, and exclaimed, \"Dog of a\r\nnegro! what and who has made thee a spy upon my actions?\"\r\n\r\nAt the same instant that Ibrahim felt the hand on his shoulder, and\r\nheard the well-known voice uttering the dreadful warning in his ears,\r\nNisida awoke. Her first impulse was to start up; but, checking herself\r\nwith wondrous presence of mind, as the part of the deaf and dumb person\r\nwhich she had imposed upon herself to play flashed with lightning\r\nvelocity across her brain--comprehending, too, in an instant, that the\r\ngrand vizier had violated her privacy, but that some unknown succor was\r\nat hand, she remained perfectly motionless, as if still wrapped up in an\r\nundisturbed slumber. The grand vizier, and the individual whom he had in\r\nhis rage addressed as a \"dog of a negro,\" retreated into the saloon,\r\nNisida holding her very breath so as not to lose a word that might pass\r\nbetween them should their dialogue be resumed.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness asks me what and who has made me a spy upon your\r\nactions,\" said the negro in a low, monotonous voice, and speaking with\r\nmingled firmness and respect. \"Those questions are easily answered. The\r\nsame authority which ordered me to wrest from thine arms some months\r\npast the lady who might be unfortunate enough to please your highness'\r\nfancy, exercises an unceasing supervision over you, even on this ship,\r\nand in the middle of the mighty sea. To that authority all your deeds\r\nand acts are matters of indifference save those which would render your\r\nhighness faithless to an adoring wife. Remember, my lord, the fate of\r\nCalanthe, the sister of your dependent Demetrius, she who was torn from\r\nyour arms, and whose beauteous form became food for the fishes of the\r\nBosporus.\"\r\n\r\n\"How knew you who she was?\" demanded the grand vizier, in a low, hoarse\r\nvoice, the power of his utterance having been temporarily suspended by\r\nthe rage that filled his soul at finding his iniquitous design in\r\nrespect to Nisida thus suddenly baffled by the chief of the three black\r\nslaves, whose attendance in this expedition had been forced upon him by\r\nthe Sultana Valida; \"how knew you who she was?\" he again asked.\r\n\r\n\"Rather demand, my lord, what can escape the prying eyes of those by\r\nwhom your highness has been surrounded ever since the seals of office\r\nwere in your grasp,\" returned the slave.\r\n\r\n\"But you would not betray that secret to Demetrius, who is now devoted\r\nto me, who is necessary to me, and who would loathe me were he to learn\r\nthe dreadful fate of his sister!\" said the grand vizier, with rapid and\r\nexcited utterance.\r\n\r\n\"I have no eyes and no ears, great pasha,\" said the negro, \"save in\r\nrespect to those matters which would render you faithless to the sister\r\nof the sultan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would to Heaven that you had neither eyes nor ears at all--that you did\r\nnot exist, indeed!\" exclaimed Ibrahim, unable to repress his wrath;\r\nthen, in a different and milder tone, he immediately added, \"Slave, I\r\ncan make thee free--I can give thee wealth--and thou mayest dwell in\r\nhappy Italy, whither we are going, for the remainder of thy days.\r\nReflect, consider! I love that deaf and dumb Christian woman who\r\nsleepeth there--I already love her to distraction! Thwart me not, good\r\nslave, and thou mayest command my eternal gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, two other slaves overhear every word that now passes between\r\nus,\" responded the Ethiopian, his voice remaining calm and monotonous;\r\n\"and even were we alone in all respects, I would not betray the trust\r\nreposed in me. But not on your highness would the effects of your\r\ninfidelity to the Princess Aischa fall. No, my lord--I have no authority\r\nto harm you. Had your highness succeeded in your purpose ere now, the\r\nbow-string would have forever stifled the breath in the body of that\r\ndeaf and dumb Christian lady; and her corpse would have been thrown\r\nforth from these windows into the sea. Such are my instructions, my\r\nlord; and thus every object of your sated passion must become your\r\nvictim also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better--better were it,\" exclaimed Ibrahim, in a tone denoting the\r\nprofoundest mental anguish, \"to be the veriest mendicant who implores\r\nalms at the gate of the mosque of St. Sophia, than the grand vizier of\r\nthe Ottoman Empire.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words he rushed into the adjoining saloon, the negro\r\nfollowing and fastening the door behind him. Nisida now began to breathe\r\nfreely once more. From what perils had she escaped! The violation of her\r\ncouch by the unprincipled Ibrahim would have been followed by her\r\nimmediate assassination at the hands of the Ethiopian whom the\r\nsultana-mother had placed as a spy on the actions of her son-in-law. On\r\nthe other hand, she felt rejoiced that the incident of this night had\r\noccurred; for it had been the means of revealing to her a secret of\r\nimmense importance in connection with the grand vizier. She remembered\r\nthe terms of grief and affection in which Demetrius had spoken of the\r\ndisappearance of Calanthe; and she had heard enough on that occasion to\r\nconvince her that the Greek would become the implacable enemy of any man\r\nwho had wronged that much-loved sister. How bitter, then, would be the\r\nhatred of Demetrius--how dreadful would be the vengeance which he must\r\ncrave against him whose lustful passion had led to the murder of\r\nCalanthe. Yes, Ibrahim, thy secret is now in possession of Nisida of\r\nRiverola; in the possession of that woman of iron mind and potent\r\nenergy, and whom thou fondly believest to be deaf and dumb!\r\n\r\nNisida slept no more that night, the occurrences of which furnished her\r\nwith so much food for profound meditation: and with the earliest gleam\r\nof dawn that tinged the eastern heaven, she rose from her couch.\r\nEntering the saloon, she opened the windows to admit the gentle breeze\r\nof morning; and ere she commenced her toilet, she lingered to gaze upon\r\nthe stately ships that were plowing the blue sea in the wake of the\r\nadmiral's vessel wherein she was. Suddenly her eyes fell upon what\r\nappeared to be a small speck at a little distance; but as this object\r\nwas moving rapidly along on the surface of the Mediterranean, it soon\r\napproached sufficiently near to enable her to discern that it was a boat\r\nimpelled by a single sail. Urged by an undefinable and yet a strong\r\nsentiment of curiosity, Nisida remained at the saloon window, watching\r\nthe progress of the little bark, which bounded over the waves with\r\nextraordinary speed, bending gracefully to the breeze that thus wafted\r\nit onward. Nearer and nearer toward the vessel it came, though not\r\npursuing the same direction; and in five minutes it passed within a few\r\nyards of the stern of the kapitan-pasha's ship.\r\n\r\nBut, oh! wondrous and unaccountable fact. There, stretched upon his back\r\nin that bounding boat, and evidently buried in deep slumber, with the\r\nrays of the rising sun gleaming upon his fine and now slightly flushed\r\ncountenance, lay he whose image was so indelibly impressed upon the\r\nheart of Nisida--her handsome and strangely-fated Fernand Wagner! The\r\nmoment the conviction that the sleeper was indeed he struck to the mind\r\nof Nisida, she would have called him by name--she would have endeavored\r\nto awake him, if only to exchange a single word of fondness, for her\r\nassumed dumbness was for the moment forgotten; but she was rendered\r\nmotionless and remained speechless--stupefied, paralyzed, as it were,\r\nwith mingled wonder and joy; wonder that he should have found the means\r\nof escape from the island, and joy that she was thus permitted to behold\r\nhim at least once again. But the pleasure which this incident excited in\r\nher mind was transitory indeed; for the boat swept by, as if urged on by\r\na stronger impulse than that of the gentle breeze of morning--and in\r\nanother minute Nisida beheld it no more.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting behind the western hills of Sicily as Fernand Wagner\r\nentered the squalid suburb which at that period stretched from the town\r\nof Syracuse to the sea. His step was elastic, and he held his head\r\nhigh--for his heart was full of joyous and burning hope. Hitherto the\r\npromises of the angel who had last appeared to him were completely\r\nfulfilled. The boat was wafted by a favorable breeze direct from the\r\nIsland of Snakes to the shores of Sicily; and he had landed in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of Syracuse--the town in which a further revelation\r\nwas to be made in respect to the breaking of the spell which had fixed\r\nupon him the frightful doom of the Wehr-Wolf! But little suspected\r\nFernand Wagner that one morning, while he slept, his boat had borne him\r\nthrough the proud fleet of the Ottomans--little wist he that his beloved\r\nNisida had caught sight of him as he was wafted rapidly past the stern\r\nof the kapitan-pasha's ship! For on that occasion he had slept during\r\nhours; and when he had awakened, not a bark nor sail save his own was\r\nvisible on the mighty expanse of water.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was with elastic step and joyous heart that the hero of our\r\ntale entered the town of Syracuse. But suddenly he remembered the\r\nsingular nature of the inquiry that he was there to make--an inquiry\r\nconcerning a man whose years had numbered one hundred and sixty-two!\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" thought Wagner, \"that good angel who gave me a sign\r\nwhereby I should become convinced of the reality of her appearance, and\r\nwhose promises have all been fulfilled up to this point, could not\r\npossibly mislead me. No; I will obey the command which I received, even\r\nthough I should visit every human dwelling in the town of Syracuse! For\r\nHeaven works out its wise purposes in wondrous manners; and it is not\r\nfor me to shrink from yielding obedience to its orders, nor to pause to\r\nquestion their propriety. And oh! if I can but shake off that demon\r\ninfluence which weighs upon my soul--if I can but escape from the\r\nshackles which still enchain me to a horrible doom, how sincere will be\r\nmy thanks to Heaven, how unbounded my rejoicings!\"\r\n\r\nAs Wagner had reached this point in his meditations, he stopped at the\r\ndoor of a barber shop of mean appearance--the pole, with the basin\r\nhanging to it, denoting that the occupant of the place combined, as was\r\nusual in those times, the functions of shaver and blood-letter or\r\nsurgeon. Hastily surveying the exterior of the shop, and fancying that\r\nit was precisely the one at which his inquiries should commence--barbers\r\nin that age being as famous for their gossiping propensities as in\r\nthis--Fernand entered, and was immediately accosted by a short,\r\nsharp-visaged, dark-complexioned old man, who pointed to a seat, saying\r\nin a courteous, or rather obsequious tone, \"What is your will, signor?\"\r\n\r\nFernand desired the barber-surgeon to shave his superfluous beard and\r\ntrim his hair; and while that individual was preparing his lather and\r\nsharpening his razor in the most approved style of the craft, Wagner\r\nasked in a seemingly careless tone, \"What news have you, good master, in\r\nSyracuse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naught of importance, signor,\" was the reply; \"mere everyday matters.\r\nSyracuse is indeed wretchedly dull. There were only two murders and\r\nthree attempts at assassination reported to the lieutenant of police\r\nthis morning, and that is nothing for a town usually so active and\r\nbustling as ours. For my part, I don't know what has come over the\r\npeople? I stepped as far as the dead-house just now to view the body of\r\na young lady, unclaimed as yet, who had her head nearly severed from her\r\ntrunk last night; and then I proceeded to the great square to see\r\nwhether any executions are to take place to-morrow; but really there is\r\nnothing of any consequence to induce one to stir abroad in Syracuse just\r\nat this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Murders and attempts at assassination are matters of very common\r\noccurrence amongst you, then?\" said Wagner, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"We get a perfect surfeit of them, signor,\" returned the barber, now\r\napplying the soap to his customer's face. \"They fail to create any\r\nsensation now, I can assure you. Beside, one gets tired of executions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally enough,\" said Fernand. \"But I have heard that there are some\r\nvery extraordinary personages in Syracuse; indeed, there is one who has\r\nlived to a remarkable age----\"\r\n\r\n\"The oldest person I know of, is the Abbot of St. Mary's,\" interrupted\r\nthe barber, \"and he----\"\r\n\r\n\"And he----\" repeated Wagner, with feverish impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Is ninety-seven and three months, signor; a great age, truly,\"\r\nresponded the barber-surgeon.\r\n\r\nFernand's hopes were immediately cooled down; but thinking that he ought\r\nto put his inquiry in a direct manner, he said: \"Then it is not true\r\nthat you have in Syracuse an individual who has reached the wondrous age\r\nof a century three-score and two?\"\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin have mercy upon you, signor!\" ejaculated the barber, \"if\r\nyou really put faith in the absurd stories that people tell about the\r\nRosicrucians!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! then the people of Syracuse do talk on such matters?\" said Wagner,\r\nconceiving that he had obtained a clew to the aim and object of his\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Have you never heard, signor, of the Order of the Rosy Cross?\" demanded\r\nthe barber, who was naturally of a garrulous disposition, and who now\r\nappeared to have entered on a favorite subject.\r\n\r\n\"I have heard, in my travels, vague mention made of such an order,\"\r\nanswered Fernand; \"but I never experienced any curiosity to seek to\r\nlearn more--and, indeed, I may say, that I know nothing of the\r\nRosicrucians save their mere name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, signor,\" continued the barber, \"for common pass-talk, it is as\r\ngood a subject as any other; but no one shall ever persuade me either\r\nthat there is really such an order as the Brothers of the Rosy Cross, or\r\nthat it is possible for human beings to attain the powers attributed to\r\nthat fraternity.\"\r\n\r\n\"You interest me much by your remarks, good leech,\" exclaimed Fernand;\r\n\"I pray you to give me further explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"With infinite pleasure, signor, since you appear to desire it,\"\r\nreturned the barber, still pursuing his tonsorial duties. \"You must know\r\nthat there are many wild legends and stories abroad concerning these\r\ninvisible beings denominated Rosicrucians. But the one which gains most\r\ngeneral credence is that the brotherhood was founded by a certain\r\nChristianus Rosencrux, a German philosopher, who fancied that the arts\r\nand sciences might be developed in such a manner as to confer the\r\ngreatest possible blessings on the human race.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the aims of Rosencrux are entirely good and philanthropic?\" said\r\nWagner, interrogatively.\r\n\r\n\"As a matter of course, signor,\" said the barber; \"and therefore, if\r\nsuch a man ever did live, he must have been an insane visionary--for who\r\nwould believe that knowledge could possibly make us richer, happier, or\r\nbetter? All the philosophy in the universe could never convert this shop\r\ninto a palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are wandering from your subject, my good friend,\" gently\r\nremonstrated Fernand.\r\n\r\n\"I crave your pardon, signor. Let me see. Oh, I recollect; we were\r\ntalking of Christianus Rosencrux. Well, signor, the fabled philosopher\r\nwas a monk, and a very wise as well as a very good man. I am only\r\ntelling you the most generally received legend, mind, and would not have\r\nyou think that I believe it myself. So this Rosencrux, finding that his\r\ncloistral existence was inconvenient for the prosecution of his studies,\r\ntraveled into the East, and spent many years in acquiring the knowledge\r\nhanded down to the wise men of those climes by the ancient Magi and\r\nChaldeans. He visited Egypt, and learnt many wonderful secrets by\r\nstudying the hieroglyphics on the Egyptian pyramids. I forget how long\r\nhe remained in the East; but it is said that he visited every place of\r\ninterest in the Holy Land, and received heavenly inspirations on the\r\nspot where our Saviour was crucified. On his return to Europe, he saw\r\nfull well that if he revealed all his knowledge at once, he would be put\r\nto death by the inquisition as a wizard, and the world would lose the\r\nbenefit of all the learning he had acquired. So says the legend; and it\r\ngoes on to recite that Christianus Rosencrux then founded the order of\r\nthe Rosy Cross, which was nothing more or less than a brotherhood of\r\nwise men whom he initiated in all his secrets, with the intention that\r\nthey should reveal from time to time small portions thereof, and thus\r\ngive to the world by very slow degrees that immense amount of knowledge\r\nwhich he supposed would have stupefied and astounded everybody if made\r\npublic all at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange--most strange,\" thought Wagner within himself, \"that I should\r\nnever have gleaned all these details before, eager as my inquiries and\r\nresearches in the pursuit of knowledge have been. But Heaven has willed\r\neverything for the best; and it is doubtless intended that my salvation\r\nshall proceed from the very quarter which was least known to me, and\r\nconcerning which I have manifested the most contemptuous indifference,\r\nin the sphere of knowledge!\"\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be much interested, signor,\" said the barber, \"in this\r\nsame tale of Christianus Rosencrux. But there is too much intelligence\r\ndepicted on your countenance to allow me to suppose that you will place\r\nany reliance on the absurd story. How is it possible, signor, that an\r\norder could have existed for so many years without any one member ever\r\nhaving betrayed the secrets which bind them all together? Moreover,\r\ntheir place of abode and study is totally unknown to the world; and if\r\nthey inhabited the deepest caverns under the earth accident must, sooner\r\nor later, have led to its discovery. Believe me, signor, 'tis naught\r\nsave a ridiculous legend; though a poor, ignorant man myself, I hope I\r\nhave too much good sense and too much respect for my father-confessor,\r\nto suppose for a minute that there is on earth any set of men more\r\nlearned than the holy ministers of the church.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long ago is Christianus Rosencrux reported to have lived?\" demanded\r\nWagner, suddenly interrupting the garrulous and narrow-minded Sicilian.\r\n\r\n\"There we are again!\" he ejaculated. \"The credulous declare that\r\nRosencrux discovered in the East the means of prolonging existence, and\r\nthough he was born as far back as the year 1359, he is still alive.\"\r\n\r\nHad not the barber turned aside at that precise instant to fill an ewer\r\nand place a towel for his customer's use, he would have been surprised\r\nby the sudden start and the expression of ineffable joy which denoted\r\nFernand's emotions, as by a rapid calculation mentally made, our hero\r\nperceived that if Rosencrux were born in 1359, and alive at that\r\nmoment--namely, in 1521--his age would be exactly one hundred and\r\nsixty-two!\r\n\r\n\"It is Christianus Rosencrux, then,\" he said to himself, \"whom I have\r\ninquired for--whom I am to see--and who will dissolve the spell that has\r\nbeen placed upon me. But where shall I seek him? whither shall I go to\r\nfind his secret abode?\"\r\n\r\nThe duties of the barber were completed; and Wagner threw down a piece\r\nof gold, saying, \"Keep that coin, friend, for your discourse has greatly\r\ninterested me, and has indeed well deserved it.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor old man had never possessed in all his life so much money at\r\none time; and so vast was his joy that he could only mutter a few broken\r\nsentences to express his gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"I require not thanks, my good friend,\" said Wagner. \"But one word ere I\r\ndepart. Knowest thou the spot which rumor indicates as the abode of that\r\nsect of whom we have been speaking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, excellent signor,\" replied the barber; \"there your question\r\nmasters me; for in this case rumor goes not to such a length as to\r\nafford hints for an investigation which would prove its utter fallacy.\r\nAll that I have heard, signor, concerning the Rosicrucians, you have\r\nlearnt from my lips; and I know no more.\"\r\n\r\nWagner, finding that further inquiry in that quarter was useless, took\r\nleave of the old man, and traversing the suburb, entered the town of\r\nSyracuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nFernand was now at a loss how to act. He felt convinced that it was\r\nuseless to institute any further inquiries relative to the whereabouts\r\nof the secret Order of the Rosy Cross; because, had popular rumor ever\r\nhinted at any clew in that respect, the garrulous and inquisitive barber\r\nwould have been sure to hear of it. He was not, however, disheartened.\r\nNo--very far from that; for he was confident that the same supernal\r\npower that had hitherto directed him, and which was rapidly clearing\r\naway all obstacles in his path toward perfect emancipation from the\r\ninfluence of the evil one, would carry him to a successful and\r\ntriumphant issue. Throwing himself, therefore, entirely on the wisdom\r\nand mercy of Heaven, he roamed about the town of Syracuse, without any\r\nsettled object in view, until he was much wearied and it was very late.\r\nHe then entered a miserable hostel, or inn--the best, however, that he\r\ncould discover; and there, having partaken of some refreshment, he\r\nretired to the chamber allotted to him. Sleep soon visited his eyes; but\r\nhe had not long enjoyed the sweets of slumber, when that balmy repose\r\nwas interrupted either by a touch or sound, he knew not which. Starting\r\nup in his couch, he perceived a tall figure, muffled in a huge dark\r\nmantle, and wearing a slouched broad-brimmed hat, standing by the side\r\nof the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Rise, Fernand Wagner,\" said a mild but masculine voice, \"and follow me.\r\nHe whom thou seekest has sent me to lead thee to him.\"\r\n\r\nWagner did not hesitate to obey this mandate, which he felt certain was\r\nconnected with the important business that had borne him to Syracuse.\r\nHis apparel was speedily assumed; and he said, \"I am ready to follow\r\nthee, stranger, whoever thou art, and whithersoever thou mayst lead; for\r\nmy faith is in Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who have faith shall prosper,\" observed the stranger, in a solemn\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nHe then led the way noiselessly down the steep staircase of the inn, and\r\nissued forth by the front gate, closely followed by Wagner. In deep\r\nsilence did they proceed through the dark, narrow, and tortuous streets,\r\nleaving at length the town behind them, and then entering upon a barren\r\nand uneven waste. By degrees an object, at first dimly seen in the\r\ndistance, and by the uncertain moonlight, which was constantly\r\nstruggling with the dark clouds of a somewhat tempestuous night, assumed\r\na more defined appearance, until a mass of gigantic ruins at length\r\nstood out from the somber obscurity. In a few moments the moon shone\r\nforth purely and brightly; and its beams, falling on decayed buttresses,\r\nbroken Gothic arches, deep entrance-ways, remnants of pinnacles and\r\nspires, massive walls of ruined towers, gave a wildly romantic and yet\r\nnot unpicturesque aspect to the remains of what was evidently once a\r\nvast monastic institution. The muffled stranger led the way amongst the\r\nruins, and at last stopped at a gate opening into a small square\r\ninclosure formed by strong iron railings, seven feet high and shaped at\r\nthe points like javelins. Passing through the gateway, the guide\r\nconducted Wagner into a cemetery, which was filled with the marble tombs\r\nof the mitered abbots who had once held sway over the monastery and the\r\nbroad lands attached to it.\r\n\r\n\"You behold around you,\" said the muffled stranger, waving his arm\r\ntoward the ruins, \"all that remains of a sanctuary once the most\r\ncelebrated in Sicily for the piety and wisdom of its inmates. But a\r\nhorrible crime, a murder perpetrated under circumstances unusually\r\ndiabolical, the criminal being no less a person than the last lord abbot\r\nhimself, and the victim a beauteous girl whom he had seduced, rendered\r\nthis institution accursed in the eyes of God and man. The monks\r\nabandoned it: and the waste over which you have passed is now the\r\nunclaimed but once fertile estate belonging to the abbey. The\r\nsuperstition of the Sicilians has not failed to invent terrific tales in\r\nconnection with these ruins: and the belief that each night at twelve\r\no'clock the soul of the guilty abbot is driven by the scourge of the\r\ndemon through the scene alike of his episcopal power and his black\r\nturpitude, effectually prevents impertinent or inconvenient intrusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe observation with which the muffled stranger concluded his brief\r\nnarrative, convinced Wagner that it was amongst those ruins the brethren\r\nof the Rosy Cross had fixed their secret abode. But he had no time for\r\nreflection, inasmuch as his guide hurried him on amidst the tombs, on\r\nwhich the light of the silver moon now streamed with a power and an\r\neffect that no dark cloud for the time impaired. Stopping at the base of\r\none of the most splendid monuments in the cemetery, the muffled stranger\r\ntouched some secret spring, and a large marble block immediately opened\r\nlike a door, the aperture revealing a narrow flight of stone steps.\r\nWagner was directed to descend first, a command which he obeyed without\r\nhesitation, his guide closing the marble entrance ere he followed. For\r\nseveral minutes the two descended in total darkness. At length, a faint,\r\nglimmering light met Wagner's view; and as he proceeded it grew stronger\r\nand stronger, until it became of such dazzling brilliancy that his eyes\r\nached with the supernatural splendor. That glorious luster was diffused\r\nfrom a silver lamp, hanging to the arched roof of a long passage, or\r\ncorridor of masonry, to which the stone steps led.\r\n\r\n\"Fernand Wagner,\" said the guide, in his mild and somewhat monotonous\r\nvoice, \"thou now beholdest the eternal lamp of the Rosicrucians. For a\r\nhundred and twenty years has that lamp burnt with as powerful a luster\r\nas that which it now sheds forth; and never once--no, not once during\r\nthat period, has it been replenished. No human hand has touched it since\r\nthe day when it was first suspended there by the great founder of our\r\nsect.\"\r\n\r\nAll doubt was now dispelled from the mind of Wagner--if a doubt he had\r\neven for a moment entertained since the muffled stranger had summoned\r\nhim from the inn:--he was indeed in the secret abode of the holy sect of\r\nthe Rosy Cross! His guide, too, was a member of that brotherhood--and\r\nthere, almost too dazzling to gaze upon, burnt the eternal lamp which\r\nwas the symbol of the knowledge cherished by the order! Wagner turned to\r\ngaze in wonder and admiration upon his guide: and beneath the broad brim\r\nof the slouched hat, he beheld a countenance venerable with years,\r\nimposing with intelligence, and benevolent with every human charity.\r\n\"Wise and philanthropic Rosicrucian!\" exclaimed Wagner, \"I offer thee my\r\ndeepest gratitude for having permitted me to enter this sanctuary. But\r\nhow camest thou to learn that I sought admittance hither? and unveil to\r\nme the great mysteries of this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the servants of holy angels, who reveal to us in visions the\r\nwill of the Most High,\" answered the Rosicrucian; \"and they who\r\ncommanded me to bring thee hither, will induce thine heart to retain our\r\nsecret inviolable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for worlds,\" cried Wagner, with an enthusiasm which denoted\r\nsincerity, \"would I betray ye!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis well,\" said the Rosicrucian, with philosophic calmness--as if he\r\nput more faith in the protecting influence of Heaven than in the\r\npromises of man. \"I shall not accompany thee further. Follow that\r\npassage: at the extremity there are two corridors branching off in\r\ndifferent directions; but thou wilt pursue the one leading to the right.\r\nProceed fearlessly, and stop not till thou shalt stand in the presence\r\nof the founder of the sect.\"\r\n\r\nFernand hastened to obey these directions, and having threaded the two\r\npassages, he entered a large and rudely-hollowed cavern, where the\r\nfeelings of mingled awe and suspense with which he had approached it\r\nwere immediately changed into deep veneration and wonder as he found\r\nhimself in the presence of one who, by his appearance, he knew could he\r\nnone other than Christianus Rosencrux! Never had Fernand beheld a being\r\nof such venerable aspect; and, though old--evidently very old, as indeed\r\nWagner knew him to be--yet the founder of the celebrated Rosicrucians\r\nmanifested every appearance of possessing a vigorous constitution, as he\r\nwas assuredly endowed with a magnificent intellect. His beard was long\r\nand white as snow; a century and three score years had not dimmed the\r\nluster of his eyes; and his form, though somewhat bent, was masculine\r\nand well-knit. He was seated at a table covered with an infinite variety\r\nof scientific apparatus; and articles of the same nature were strewed\r\nupon the ground. To the roof hung an iron lamp, which indeed burnt\r\nfaintly after the brilliant luster of the eternal flame that Wagner had\r\nseen in the passage; but its flickering gleam shone lurid and ominous on\r\na blood-red cross suspended to the wall. Fernand drew near the table,\r\nand bowed reverentially to the Rosicrucian chief, who acknowledged his\r\nsalutation with a benignant smile.\r\n\r\n\"Wagner,\" he said, in a firm but mild tone, \"I have been forewarned of\r\nthy coming, and am prepared to receive thee. Thy constant and unvarying\r\nfaith in Heaven has opened to thee the gates of salvation; and it is\r\nmine to direct thee how to act, that the dreadful doom which thou hast\r\ndrawn upon thyself may be annihilated soon and forever.\"\r\n\r\nThe venerable man paused, and Fernand again bowed lowly and with\r\nprofound respect.\r\n\r\n\"So soon as the morning's sun shall have revisited this hemisphere,\"\r\ncontinued Rosencrux, \"thou must depart for Italy. Start not,\r\nFernand--but prepare to obey that power which will sustain thee. On\r\narriving in Italy, proceed direct to Florence; and fear not to enter\r\nthat city even in the broad daylight. Thou wilt not be harmed! There\r\nawait the current of those circumstances that must lead to the grand\r\nevent which is ordained to break the spell that has cast upon thee the\r\ndoom of a Wehr-Wolf. For as thou didst voluntarily unite thyself in the\r\nface of heaven with Donna Nisida of Riverola, so it is decreed, for the\r\nwisest purposes, that a circumstance intimately connected with her\r\ndestiny must become a charm and a talisman to change thine own. On thine\r\narrival in Florence, therefore, seek not to avoid Lady Nisida; but\r\nrather hasten at once to her presence--and again I say, a supernal power\r\nwill protect thee from any baneful influence which she might still\r\nexercise over thee. For, the spell that the evil one hath cast upon\r\nthee, Fernand Wagner, shall be broken only on that day and in that hour\r\nwhen thine eyes shall behold the skeletons of two innocent victims\r\nsuspended to the same beam!\"\r\n\r\nHaving uttered these words in a louder and hurried, but not the less\r\nimpressive tone, than he had at first used, Christianus Rosencrux\r\nmotioned impatiently for Wagner to depart. And Fernand, amazed and\r\nhorrified at the dreadful words which had met his ears, retreated from\r\nthe cavern and sped rapidly back to the spot where he had quitted his\r\nguide, whom he found waiting his return beneath the undying lamp. The\r\nRosicrucian conducted Wagner in silence from that deep and subterranean\r\nabode beneath the tomb; thence through the cemetery amidst the ruins of\r\nthe monastery--and across the wild waste, back to Syracuse; nor did the\r\nmuffled brother of the Rosy Cross take leave of Fernand until they had\r\nreached the door of the hostel. There they parted, the Rosicrucian\r\ninvoking a blessing upon the head of Wagner, who regained his chamber\r\nwithout disturbing the other inmates of the house: but with the\r\nconflicting emotions of ardent hopes and appalling fears, and holy\r\naspirations, filling his breast. By degrees, however, as he was enabled\r\nto reason to himself with increasing calmness, the fears and the doubts\r\nbecame fainter and fainter, while the hopes and the aspirations grew\r\nstronger and stronger: and at length, throwing himself upon his knees,\r\nhe exclaimed fervently, \"O Lord, deal with me as thou wilt--thy will be\r\ndone!\"\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon of a sultry day, toward the close of\r\nSeptember, or, to be more particular, on the 25th of that month, that a\r\nnumerous and brilliant cavalcade, on emerging from a grove which bounded\r\none of the sinuosities of the Arno, came within sight of the towers and\r\npinnacles of Florence.\r\n\r\nOn the white felt turbans of a hundred and fifty Ottoman soldiers\r\nglistened the crescent, the symbol of Islamism; and their steel-sheathed\r\nscimiters and the trappings of their horses sent forth a martial din as\r\nthey were agitated by the rapidity of the march.\r\n\r\nForty-eight slaves, also mounted on steeds procured at Leghorn, followed\r\nthe soldiers with a short interval between the two corps, and in the\r\nspace thus left, rode the Greek Demetrius and Lady Nisida of Riverola.\r\nThe latter wore the garb of her sex, and sat upon her horse with the\r\ngrace of an amazonian queen.\r\n\r\nThe moment the cavalcade came in sight of the fair City of Flowers, a\r\nflush of joy and triumph suddenly diffused itself over Nisida's\r\ncountenance; and her lips were simultaneously compressed to prevent the\r\nutterance of that exclamation of gladness which her heart sent up to her\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nDemetrius now commanded a temporary halt; addressing himself to a\r\nTurkish youth, who had been attached to his person in the capacity of\r\nsecretary, he said, \"Yakoub, hie thou in advance, with an escort of two\r\nsoldiers and two slaves, and push on to Florence. There seek an\r\nimmediate interview with the president of the council of state, and\r\nacquaint that high functionary with the tidings of my approach. Thou\r\nwilt inform him that I am about to enter Florence in the peaceful\r\ncapacity of envoy from the puissant and most glorious Ibrahim Pasha, the\r\nvizier of the sultan, to treat on divers matters interesting to the\r\nhonor of the Ottoman Porte and the welfare of all Italy. In the\r\nmeantime, I shall so check our speed that we may not reach the city\r\nuntil after sunset, which arrangement will afford you two full hours to\r\naccomplish the mission which I now trust to thee.\"\r\n\r\nYakoub bowed, and hastened to obey the commands which he had\r\nreceived--speeding toward Florence, attended by two soldiers and two\r\nslaves. Demetrius then ordered his party to dismount and rest for a\r\nshort space upon the banks of the Arno. Some of his slaves immediately\r\npitched a tent, into which he conducted Nisida; and refreshments were\r\nserved to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the repast was concluded, and they were left alone together for a\r\nfew minutes, Nisida's manner suddenly changed from calm patrician\r\nreserve to a strange agitation--her lips quivered, her eyes flashed\r\nfire;--and then, as if desperately resolved to put into execution the\r\nidea which she had formed, she seized Demetrius by the hand, bent her\r\nhead toward him, and murmured in the faintest whisper possible, \"Start\r\nnot to hear the sound of my voice! I am neither deaf nor dumb. But this\r\nis not the place for explanations. I have much to tell, you much to\r\nhear--for I can speak to thee of Calanthe, and prove that he whom thou\r\nservest so zealously is a wretch meriting only thy vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! my God!--what marvels are now taking place!\" murmured the\r\nGreek, surveying Nisida in profound astonishment not unmingled with\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n\"Silence--silence, I implore you!\" continued she, in the rapid, low, and\r\nyet distinctly audible whisper, \"for _your_ sake--for _mine_, betray me\r\nnot! Deaf and dumb must I appear--deaf and dumb must I yet be deemed for\r\na short space. But to-night, at twelve o'clock, you will meet me,\r\nDemetrius, in the garden of the Riverola mansion;--and then I will\r\nconduct you to an apartment where we may confer without fear of being\r\noverheard--without danger of interruption.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not fail thee, lady,\" said the Greek, scarcely able to recover\r\nfrom the amazement into which Nisida's sudden revelation of her power of\r\nspeech and hearing had thrown him: then, as an oppressive feeling seized\r\nupon his soul, he demanded, \"But Calanthe, lady, in the name of heaven!\r\none word more and let that word give me hope that I may see my sister\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Demetrius,\" answered Nisida, her countenance becoming ominous and\r\nsomber, \"you will never behold her more. The lust of Ibrahim Pasha--nay,\r\nstart not so violently--brought destruction and death upon Calanthe!\"\r\n\r\nThe features of the young Greek were at first distorted with anguish,\r\nand tears started from his eyes: but in the next moment their expression\r\nchanged to one denoting the fiercest rage.\r\n\r\nNisida understood all that was passing in his soul; and she bent upon\r\nhim a significant glance, which said more eloquently than language could\r\nhave done--\"Yes, vengeance thou shalt have!\"\r\n\r\nShe then rose from the velvet cushions which had been spread upon the\r\nground within the tent, and waving her hand in token of temporary\r\nfarewell to Demetrius, hastened forth, mounted her horse, and departed,\r\nalone and unattended, toward Florence.\r\n\r\nGreat was the surprise that evening of the numerous servants and\r\ndependents at the Riverola mansion, when Donna Nisida suddenly\r\nreappeared after an absence of very nearly seven months--and that\r\nabsence so unaccountable to them! Although her haughty and imperious\r\nmanner had never been particularly calculated to render her beloved by\r\nthe menials of the household, yet her supposed affliction of deafness\r\nand dumbness had naturally made her an object of interest; and,\r\nmoreover, as close upon three months had elapsed since Count Francisco\r\nhimself had disappeared in a strange and alarming way two days only\r\nafter his return from the wars, the domestics were pleased to behold at\r\nleast one member of the lost family come back amongst them. Thus it was\r\nwith sincere demonstrations of delight that the dependents and menials\r\nwelcomed Donna Nisida at Riverola; and she was not ungracious enough to\r\nreceive their civilities with coldness. But she speedily escaped from\r\nthe ceremonies of this reception: and, intimating by signs to the female\r\nminions who were about to escort her to her apartments that she was\r\nanxious to be alone, she hurried thither, her heart leaping with joy at\r\nthe thought of being once more beneath the roof of the palace of her\r\nforefathers. And, Fernand--wast thou forgotten? Oh! no--no; in spite of\r\nall her revived schemings and new plots, Nisida, thy well-beloved\r\nNisida, had room in her heart for thine image! On reaching her own suit\r\nof apartments, the key of which had been handed to her by one of the\r\nfemale dependents, Nisida found everything in the same state as when she\r\nlast was there; and it appeared to her a dream, yes, a very wondrous\r\ndream, that she had been absent for nearly seven months, and during that\r\nperiod had seen and experienced such strange vicissitudes. The reader\r\nneed scarcely be informed that Nisida's first impulse, on entering her\r\nown suit of apartments in the Riverola mansion, was to hasten and gaze\r\nonce more upon the portrait of her mother, and intent, earnest,\r\nenthusiastic was the upraised look now fixed upon that portrait, even as\r\nwhen we first saw Nisida contemplating the sweet and benignant\r\ncountenance in the second chapter of our narrative. Yes:--and again was\r\nher gaze indicative of a devotion, an adoration, a worship.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my sainted mother,\" thought Nisida within her breast, \"I have not\r\nproved ultimately faithless to the solemn vows I pledged to thee upon\r\nthy death-bed! No; if for a time I yielded to the voluptuous idleness of\r\nlove and passion in that now far off Mediterranean isle, yet, at last\r\ndid I arouse myself to energy for young Francisco's sake, and I came\r\nback as soon as Heaven sent me the means of return to the place where my\r\npresence may best serve _his_ interests, and carry out _thy_ wishes!\r\nFor, oh! when thou wast alive, my worshiped, my adored mother, how good,\r\nhow kind, how affectionate wast thou toward me. And that tenderness of a\r\nmother for her offspring, ah! how well can I comprehend it now; for I\r\nalso shall soon become a mother. Yes, Fernand! within the last week I\r\nhave received the conviction that a being bearing thine image will see\r\nthe light in due time; and the honor of the proud name of Riverola\r\nrequires that our child must not be born of an unwedded mother! But wilt\r\nthou seek me out, Fernand? Oh! where art thou now? whither was the bark,\r\nin which I beheld thee last, wafting thee away?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, all the while that these thoughts were agitating within her mind,\r\nDonna Nisida kept her eyes intently fixed on the portrait; but on\r\nreflecting a second time that should she fail to meet with Wagner soon\r\nagain, or should he prove faithless to her, or if, indeed, he should\r\nnurse resentment and loathing for her on account of her unworthy conduct\r\ntoward him on the island, and that her child should be born of an\r\nunwedded mother,--when, we say, she thought of this dread probability a\r\nsecond time, she burst into tears, and turned away from the\r\ncontemplation of her mother's countenance. And Nisida so seldom wept,\r\nthat when tears did escape the usually sealed up springs of her\r\nemotions, they came in torrents, and were most bitter and painful to\r\nshed. But she at length triumphed over her feelings, or rather, their\r\noutpourings relieved her; and now the remembrance of another duty which\r\nshe had resolved upon performing the moment she should reach home again\r\nwas uppermost in her mind. She contemplated a visit to the mysterious\r\ncloset--the dark cabinet of horrible secrets, in order to ascertain\r\nwhether curiosity had triumphed over Francisco's prudence, or if any one\r\nindeed had violated the loneliness of that chamber in which the late\r\nCount of Riverola, had breathed his last. She accordingly took a lamp in\r\nher hand, for it was now far advanced in the evening, and proceeded to\r\nthe apartment where a father's dying injunctions had been given to her\r\nbrother, and which that father and that brother had so little suspected\r\nto have been heard and greedily drunk in by her ears. The door of the\r\nroom was locked; Nisida accordingly proceeded forthwith to her brother's\r\nchamber; and there, in a secret place where she knew he had been\r\naccustomed to keep papers or valuables, she found the key of the chamber\r\ncontaining the mysterious closet, but not the key of the closet itself.\r\nOf this latter circumstance she was glad; inasmuch as she conceived that\r\nhe had adopted her counsel to carry it invariably secured about his\r\nperson, so that no prying domestics might use it in his absence.\r\nReturning, therefore, with the one key which she had found, she entered\r\nthe apartment where her father had breathed his last.\r\n\r\nUnchanged was its appearance, in mournfulness and gloom unchanged, in\r\narrangements and features precisely the same as when she last was there,\r\non the night when she intercepted the banditti in their predatory visit.\r\nShe drew aside the hangings of the bed, a cloud of dust flew out--and\r\nfor a few moments she stood gazing on the couch where the dark spirit of\r\nher sire had fled from its mortal tenement! And as she still lingered\r\nnear the bed, the remembrance of the death-scene came so vividly back to\r\nher mind, that for an instant she fancied she beheld the cold, stern,\r\nrelentless countenance of the late Count of Riverola upon the pillow;\r\nand she turned away more in loathing and abhorrence than alarm, for\r\nthrough her brain flashed in dread association with his memory, the\r\nawful words--\"And as the merciless scalpel hacked and hewed away at the\r\nstill almost palpitating flesh of the murdered man, in whose breast the\r\ndagger remained deeply buried--a ferocious joy--a savage, hyena-like\r\ntriumph filled my soul; and I experienced no remorse for the deed I had\r\ndone!\"\r\n\r\nYes, she turned aside, and was advancing rapidly toward the mysterious\r\ncloset, when--holy God!--was it reality or imagination? Was it a human\r\nbeing or a specter from another world? For a tall, dark form, muffled\r\napparently in a long cowl--or it might be a cloak, but Nisida was too\r\nbewildered to discriminate aright--glided from the middle of the room\r\nwhere her eyes first beheld it, and was lost to view almost as soon as\r\nseen. Strong minded as Nisida was, indomitable as was her courage, and\r\nfar away as she was from being superstitious, yet now she staggered,\r\nreeled, and would have fallen had she not come in contact with the\r\nmysterious closet, against which she leaned for support. She gasped for\r\nbreath, and her eyes were fixed wildly upon the door by which the\r\nfigures had disappeared. Nevertheless, she had so far retained her\r\npresence of mind as to grasp the lamp firmly in her hand, for at that\r\nmoment, after such a fright, in the room where her father had died, and\r\nin the close vicinity of the fearful cabinet, even Nisida would have\r\nfainted with terror to be left in darkness.\r\n\r\n\"'Twas imagination--naught save imagination,\" she thought within\r\nherself, as she exerted all her power to surmount the alarms that had\r\nseized upon her. \"But no! I remember to have closed the door carefully\r\nbehind me, and now it is open!\"\r\n\r\nAs that reminiscence and conviction flashed to her mind, she nerved\r\nherself to advance into the passage; but all was silent, and not a soul\r\nwas there save herself. Scarcely knowing what to think, yet ashamed to\r\ngive way to superstitious fears, Nisida retraced her steps, and\r\nproceeded to examine the door of the closet. She was satisfied that it\r\nhad never been opened since the night of her father's death; for the\r\nseals which she had induced Francisco to place upon the lock next day\r\nwere still there. But all the while she was thus scrutinizing the door,\r\nthe lock, and the seals, she could not help occasionally casting a\r\nfurtive glance around, to convince herself that the tall, dark, muffled\r\nform was not standing behind her: and, as she retraced her way to her\r\nown apartments, she stopped now and then through dread that _other_\r\nfootsteps beside her own echoed in the long and lonely corridors of the\r\nold mansion. She, however, regained her chamber in safety, and fell into\r\na deep reverie respecting the tall figure she had seen. Were it not for\r\nthe fact, of which she was confident, of her having closed the door on\r\nentering the room where her father had died, she would have concluded\r\nthat her imagination had deluded her; but she now feared lest she might\r\nbe watched by spies for some unknown and hostile purpose. It was\r\nperplexing, to say the least of it; and Nisida determined to adopt all\r\npossible precautions against her secret enemies, whoever they might be.\r\n\r\nShe accordingly arose from her seat--put off her upper garment--donned\r\nher thin but strong corselet--and then assumed the black velvet robe\r\nwhich reached up to her throat, concealing the armor beneath. Her\r\nflexible dagger--that fatal weapon which had dealt death to the\r\nunfortunate Agnes--was next thrust into the sheath formed by the wide\r\nborder of her stomacher; and Nisida smiled with haughty triumph as if in\r\ndefiance to her foes. She then repaired to one of the splendid saloons\r\nof the mansion; and ere she sat down to the repast that was served up,\r\nshe dispatched a note acquainting Dr. Duras with her return, and\r\nrequesting his immediate presence. In about half an hour the physician\r\narrived, and his joy at beholding Nisida again was only equaled by his\r\nimpatience to learn the cause of her long absence and all that had\r\nbefallen her during the interval.\r\n\r\nShe made a sign for the old man to follow her to the retirement of her\r\nown apartments; and then, having closed the door, she said to him in a\r\nlow tone, \"Doctor, we will converse by means of signs no more; for,\r\nthough still forced to simulate the deaf and dumb in the presence of the\r\nworld, yet now--with you, who have all along known my terrible\r\nsecret--our discourse must be too important to be carried on by mere\r\nsigns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida,\" returned Duras, also in a low and cautious tone, \"thou knowest\r\nthat I love thee as if thou wast my own daughter; and thy voice sounds\r\nlike music upon my ears. But when will the dreadful necessity which\r\nrenders thee dumb before the world--when will it cease, Nisida?\"\r\n\r\n\"Soon--soon, doctor--if thou wilt aid me,\" answered the lady.\r\n\r\nA long and earnest conversation then ensued; but it is not necessary to\r\ngive the details to the reader, inasmuch as their nature will soon\r\ntranspire. Suffice it to say that Nisida urged a particular request,\r\nwhich she backed by such explanation and we must also say\r\nmisrepresentations as she thought suitable to her purpose; and that Dr.\r\nDuras eventually, though not without compunction and hesitation, at\r\nlength acceded to her prayer. She then gave him a brief account of her\r\nabduction from Florence by the villain Stephano--her long residence on\r\nthe island of snakes--and her deliverance from thence by the Ottoman\r\nfleet, which was now off the port of Leghorn. But she said nothing of\r\nFernand Wagner: nor did she inform the physician that she was acquainted\r\nwith the cause of Francisco's disappearance and the place where he was\r\ndetained. At length Dr. Duras took his leave; but ere he left the room\r\nNisida caught him by the hand, saying, in a low, yet impressive\r\ntone--\"Remember your solemn promise, my dear friend, and induce your\r\nbrother to leave Flora Francatelli to her fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will--I will,\" answered the physician. \"And after all you have told\r\nme, and if she be really the bad, profligate, and evil-disposed girl you\r\nrepresent her, it will be well that the inquisition should hold her\r\ntight in its grasp.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words Dr. Duras departed, leaving Nisida to gloat over the\r\nsuccess which her plans had thus far experienced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was verging toward midnight, and the moon was concealed behind dark\r\nclouds, when a tall figure, muffled in a cloak, climbed over the railing\r\nwhich inclosed one portion of the spacious garden attached to the\r\nRiverola Palace. That person was Fernand Wagner. He had arrived in\r\nFlorence two days before that on which Nisida returned to the ancestral\r\ndwelling:--he had entered the city boldly and openly in the joyous\r\nsun-light--and yet no one molested him. He even encountered some of the\r\nvery sbirri who had arrested him in the preceding month of February;\r\nthey saluted him respectfully--thus showed that they recognized him--but\r\noffered not to harm him. His trial, his condemnation, and his escape\r\nappeared all to have been forgotten. He repaired to his mansion; his\r\nservants, who had remained in possession of the dwelling, received him\r\nwith demonstrations of joy and welcome as if he had just returned under\r\nordinary circumstances from a long journey. Truly, then, he was blessed\r\nby the protection of Heaven. And--more wondrous still--on entering his\r\nfavorite room he beheld all his pictures in their proper places, as if\r\nnone of them had ever been removed--as if the confiscation of several by\r\nthe criminal tribunal had never taken place. Over the one which had\r\nproclaimed the secret of his doom to the judges and the audience on the\r\noccasion of his trial, still hung the black cloth; and an undefinable\r\ncuriosity--no, not a sentiment of curiosity, but one of hope--impelled\r\nhim to remove the covering. And how exquisite was his joy, how great his\r\namazement, how sincere his thanksgivings, when he beheld but a blank\r\npiece of canvas. The horrible picture of the Wehr-Wolf, a picture which\r\nhe had painted when in a strangely morbid state of mind--had\r\ndisappeared. Here was another sign of Heaven's goodness--a further proof\r\nof celestial mercy.\r\n\r\nOn instituting inquiries, Fernand had learnt that Donna Nisida had not\r\nyet come back to Florence: but he employed trusty persons to watch and\r\ngive him notice of her arrival the instant it should occur. Thus Nisida\r\nhad not been half an hour at the Riverola mansion when Fernand was made\r\nacquainted with her return. From the conversation which had taken place\r\nbetween them at various times on the island, and as the reader is well\r\naware, Wagner felt convinced that Nisida would again simulate deafness\r\nand dumbness; and he was therefore desirous to avoid giving her any\r\nsurprise by appearing abruptly before her--a proceeding which might\r\nevoke a sudden ejaculation, and thus betray her secret. Moreover, he\r\nknew not whether circumstances would render his visits, made in a public\r\nmanner, agreeable to her: and, perhaps--pardon him, gentle\r\nreader--perhaps he was also curious to learn whether she still thought\r\nof him, or whether the excitement of her return had absorbed all tender\r\nfeelings of that nature.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these various motives, Wagner muffled himself in a long\r\nTuscan cloak and repaired to the vicinity of the Riverola mansion. He\r\npassed through the gardens without encountering any one, and, perceiving\r\na side door open, he entered the building. Ascending the stairs, he\r\nthought that he should be acting in accordance with the advice given him\r\nby Rosencrux, and also consistent with prudence, were he at once to seek\r\nan interview with Nisida privately. He therefore repaired in the\r\ndirection of the principal saloons of the palace; but losing his way\r\namidst the maze of corridors, he was about to retire, when he beheld the\r\nobject of his search, the beautiful Nisida, enter a room with a lamp in\r\nhand. He now felt convinced that he should meet her alone, and he\r\nhurried after her. In pursuance of his cautious plan, he opened the door\r\ngently, and was already in the middle of the apartment, when he\r\nperceived Nisida standing by the side of a bed, and with her head fixed\r\nin that immovable manner which indicates intent gazing upon some object.\r\nInstantly supposing that some invalid reposed in that couch, and now\r\nseized with a dreadful alarm lest Nisida, on beholding him, should utter\r\na sudden ejaculation which would betray the secret of her feigned\r\ndumbness, Fernand considerately retreated with all possible speed: nor\r\nwas he aware that Nisida had observed him, much less that his appearance\r\nthere had excited such fears in her breast, those fears being greatly\r\nenhanced by his negligence in leaving the door open behind him.\r\n\r\nOh! had Nisida known it was thou, Fernand Wagner, how joyous, how happy\r\nshe would have been; for the conviction that she bore the pledge of your\r\nmutual passion had made her heart yearn that eve to meet with thee\r\nagain. And was it a like attraction on thy part, or the mysterious\r\ninfluence that now guided all thy movements, which induced thee at\r\nmidnight to enter the Riverola gardens again, that thou mightest be, as\r\nit were, upon the same spot where she dwelt, and scent the fragrance of\r\nthe same flowers that perfumed the atmosphere which she breathed? Oh!\r\ndoubtless it was that mysterious influence; for thou hast now that power\r\nwithin thee which made thee strong to resist all the blandishments of\r\nthe siren, and to prefer the welfare of thine own soul to aught in this\r\nworld beside!\r\n\r\nWe said, then, at the commencement of this chapter that Fernand entered\r\nthe Riverola gardens shortly after midnight. But scarcely had he crossed\r\nthe iron railings, turned into the nearest path formed by shrubs and\r\nevergreens, when he was startled by hearing another person enter the\r\ngrounds in the same unceremonious manner. Fernand accordingly stood aside\r\nin the deep shade of the trees; and in a few moments a figure, muffled\r\nlike himself in a cloak, passed him rapidly by. Wagner was debating in\r\nhimself what course he should pursue--for he feared that some treachery\r\nwas intended toward Nisida--when to his boundless surprise, he heard the\r\nmysterious visitant say in a low tone. \"Is it you, lady?\"--to which\r\nquestion the unmistakable and never-to-be-forgotten voice of his Nisida\r\nanswered, \"'Tis I, Demetrius. Follow me noiselessly, and breathe not\r\nanother word for the present!\"\r\n\r\nFernand was shocked and grieved at what he had just heard, and which\r\nsavored so strongly of an intrigue. Had not his ears deceived him? was\r\nthis the Nisida from whom he had parted but little more than three weeks\r\nback, and who had left him that tender note which he had found in the\r\nhut on the island? But he had no time for reflection; the pair were\r\nmoving rapidly toward the mansion--and Wagner unhesitatingly followed,\r\nhis footsteps being soundless on the damp soil of the borders of\r\nflowers, and his form being concealed by the shade of the tall\r\nevergreens which he skirted.\r\n\r\nHe watched Nisida and her companion until they disappeared by a small\r\nprivate door at the back of the mansion; and this door was by them\r\nincautiously left unlocked, though shut close. It opened rapidly to\r\nWagner's hand, and he found himself at the foot of a dark staircase, the\r\nsound of ascending steps on which met his ears. Up that narrow flight he\r\nsped, noiselessly but hastily; and in a few moments he was stopped by\r\nanother door which had just closed behind those whom he was following.\r\nHere he was compelled to pause, in the hope that the partition might not\r\nbe so thick as completely to intercept the sounds of the voices in the\r\nchamber; but after listening with breathless attention for a few\r\nminutes, he could not catch even the murmuring of a whisper. It now\r\nstruck him that Nisida and her companion might have passed on into a\r\nroom more remote than the one to which that door had admitted them; and\r\nhe resolved to follow on. Accordingly, he opened the door with such\r\nsuccessful precaution that not a sound--not even the creaking of the\r\nhinge was the result; and he immediately perceived that there was a\r\nthick curtain within; for it will be recollected that this door was\r\nbehind the drapery of Nisida's bed. At the same time, a light, somewhat\r\nsubdued by the thick curtain, appeared; and the sound of voices met\r\nFernand's ears.\r\n\r\n\"Signor,\" said the melodious voice of Nisida, in its sweetest, softest\r\ntones, \"it is due to myself to tender fitting excuse for introducing you\r\nthus into my private chamber; but the necessity of discoursing together\r\nwithout fear of interruption, and in some place that is secure from the\r\nimpertinence of eavesdroppers, must serve as an apology.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady,\" replied Demetrius, \"it needed no explanation of your motive in\r\nbringing me hither to command on my part that respect which is due to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nA weight was removed from Wagner's mind: it was assuredly no tender\r\nsentiment that had brought Nisida and the Greek together this night; and\r\nthe curiosity of Fernand was therefore excited all the more strongly.\r\n\r\n\"We will not waste time in unnecessary parlance,\" resumed Nisida, after\r\na short pause; \"nor must you seek to learn the causes--the powerful\r\ncauses, which have urged me to impose upon myself the awful sacrifice\r\ninvolved in the simulation of loss of speech and hearing. Suffice it for\r\nyou to know that, when on board the kapitan-pasha's ship, I overheard\r\nevery syllable of the conversation which one day took place between the\r\napostate Ibrahim and yourself,--a conversation wherein you gave a\r\ndetailed account of all your proceedings at Florence, and in the course\r\nof which you spoke feelingly of your sister Calanthe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! poor Calanthe!\" exclaimed Demetrius, in a mournful tone; \"and is\r\nshe really no more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me while I relate the manner in which I became aware of her\r\nfate,\" said Nisida.\r\n\r\nShe then explained the treacherous visit of the grand vizier to the\r\ncabin wherein she had slept on board the Ottoman admiral's ship--the way\r\nin which the Ethiopian slave had interfered to save her--and the\r\nconversation that had taken place between Ibrahim and the negro,\r\nrevealing the dread fate of Calanthe.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that I have served so faithfully a man possessed of such\r\na demon-heart?\" cried Demetrius. \"But I will have vengeance, lady; yes,\r\nthe murdered Calanthe shall be avenged!\"\r\n\r\n\"And I too must have vengeance upon the proud and insolent vizier who\r\nsought to violate all the laws of hospitality in respect to me,\"\r\nobserved Nisida, \"and who seeks to marry his sister, the low-born Flora,\r\nthe sister of the base renegade, to the illustrious scion of the noble\r\nhouse of Riverola! Vengeance, too, must I have upon the wretch Antonio,\r\nthe panderer to my father's illicit and degrading _amours_--the\r\nmiscreant who sought to plunder this mansion, and who even dared to\r\nutter threats against me in that conversation with his accomplice\r\nVenturo, which you, signor, overheard in the streets of Florence. This\r\ngame wretch it is, too, who consigned my brother to the custody of\r\nbanditti; and though, for certain reasons, I deplore not that captivity\r\nwhich Francisco has endured, inasmuch as it has effectually prevented\r\nhim from interesting himself on behalf of Flora Francatelli, yet as\r\nAntonio was animated by vengeance only in so using my brother, he shall\r\npay the penalty due on account of all his crimes!\"\r\n\r\n\"And in the task of punishing Antonio, lady,\" said Demetrius, \"shall I\r\nbe right glad to aid--for did not the villain deceive me infamously in\r\nrespect to the dispatches which I sought to forward to Constantinople\r\nwhen last I was at Florence? and, not contented with that vile\r\ntreachery, even plotted with his accomplice Venturo against my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vengeance, then, upon our enemies, Demetrius!\" exclaimed Nisida. \"And\r\nthis is how our aims shall be accomplished,\" she continued, in a lower\r\nand less excited tone: \"The ambitious views of Ibrahim Pasha must\r\nexperience a signal defeat; and as he is too powerful to be personally\r\ninjured by us, we must torture his soul by crushing his relations--we\r\nmust punish him through the medium of his sister and his aunt. This\r\nevening I had a long discourse with Dr. Duras, who is devoted to my\r\ninterests, and over whom I wield a wondrous power of persuasion. He has\r\nundertaken to induce his brother, Angelo Duras, to abandon the cause of\r\nthe Francatellis; and the inquisition will, therefore, deal with them as\r\nit lists. Father Marco I can also manage as I will; he understands the\r\nlanguage in which the deaf and dumb converse, for he has so long been\r\nconfessor to our family. To-morrow I will undertake to send him to Rome\r\non some charitable mission connected with the church. Thus the only\r\npersons whom you secured when last you were in Florence, in the\r\ninterests of the Francatellis, will cease to watch over them; and, as\r\nthey are accused of being accomplices in the sacrilege perpetrated in\r\nthe Carmelite Convent, naught will save them from the flames of the\r\n_auto-da-fe_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! spirit of the murdered Calanthe,\" exclaimed Demetrius, with savage\r\njoy, \"thou wilt be avenged yet! And thou, false vizier, shalt writhe in\r\nthe flames at the stake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, as for Antonio, and the rest of the banditti who stormed the\r\nconvent and gave freedom to the hated Flora--who have likewise captured\r\nmy brother--and who have so long been a terror to Florence,\" continued\r\nNisida; \"we must annihilate them all at one blow; not a soul of the gang\r\nmust be spared!\"\r\n\r\nNisida knew full well that at least some of the banditti were acquainted\r\nwith the fact that she was the murderess of Agnes, and that they could\r\nalso tell an awkward tale of how she sought to bribe them to rescue\r\nFernand Wagner in case of an adverse judgment on the part of the\r\ncriminal tribunal. The total annihilation of the horde was consequently\r\nthe large aim at which she aspired, and her energetic mind shrunk not\r\nfrom any difficulties that might appear in the way toward the execution\r\nof that object.\r\n\r\n\"The design is grand, but not without its obstacles,\" observed\r\nDemetrius. \"Your ladyship will moreover adopt measures to rescue the\r\nLord Count of Riverola first.\"\r\n\r\n\"By means of gold everything can be accomplished amongst villains,\"\r\nreturned Nisida, \"and the necessary preliminaries to the carrying out of\r\nour object rest with you, signor. To-morrow morning must you seek\r\nAntonio. He knows not that you suspect his villainy and, as you will say\r\nnothing relative to the failure in the arrival of your dispatches at\r\nConstantinople, he will rest secure in the belief that you have not yet\r\ndiscovered that deed of treachery. You must represent yourself as the\r\nmortal enemy of the Count of Riverola, and so speak as to lead Antonio\r\nto confess to you where he is and offer to become the instrument of your\r\nvengeance. Then bribe Antonio heavily to deliver up Francisco into your\r\npower to-morrow night at a particular hour, and at a place not far from\r\nthe spot where you know the secret entrance of the banditti's stronghold\r\nto be.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this, lady,\" said Demetrius, \"can be easily arranged. Antonio would\r\nbarter his soul for gold; much more readily, then, will he sell the\r\nCount of Riverola to one who bids high for the possession of the noble\r\nprisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is not all,\" resumed Nisida, \"'tis merely the preface to my\r\nplan. So soon as the shades of to-morrow's evening shall have involved\r\nthe earth in obscurity, a strong party of your soldiers, properly\r\ndisguised, but well armed, must repair in small sections, or even\r\nsingly, to that grove where you have already obtained a clew to the\r\nentrance of the robbers' stronghold. Let them conceal themselves amongst\r\nthe trees in the immediate vicinity of the enormous chestnut that\r\noverhangs the precipice. When the robbers emerge from their\r\nlurking-place with Francisco, your soldiers will immediately seize upon\r\nthem. Should you then discover the secret of the entrance to the\r\nstronghold, the object will be gained,--your men will penetrate into the\r\nsubterranean den,--and the massacre of the horde will prove an easy\r\nmatter. But should it occur that those banditti who may be employed in\r\nleading forth my brother, do shut up the entrance of their den so\r\nspeedily that your dependents discover not its secrets, then must we\r\ntrust to bribery or threats to wrest that secret from the miscreants. At\r\nall events Antonio will be present to accompany Francisco to the place\r\nwhich you will appoint to meet them; and as the villain will fall into\r\nyour power, it will perhaps prove less difficult to induce him to betray\r\nhis comrades, than it might be to persuade any of the banditti\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lady, your plan has every element of success,\" observed Demetrius; \"and\r\nall shall be done as you suggest. Indeed, I will myself conduct the\r\nexpedition. But should you thus at once effect the release of Don\r\nFrancisco, will he not oppose your designs relative to the condemnation\r\nof Flora Francatelli by the inquisition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Duras is well acquainted with the precise process,\" answered\r\nNisida; \"and from him I learnt that the third examination of the\r\nprisoners will take place to-morrow, when judgment will be pronounced\r\nshould no advocate appear to urge a feasible cause of delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"The arrests took place on the 3d of July,\" said Demetrius; \"and Angelo\r\nDuras undertook to obtain a postponement for three months. To-morrow,\r\nlady, is but the 26th of September.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" responded Nisida; \"but were a delay granted, it would be for\r\neight days--and thus you perceive how nicely Angelo Duras had weighed\r\nall the intricacies of the case, and how accurately he had calculated\r\nthe length of the term to be gained by the exercise of the subtleties of\r\nthe inquisitorial law. Therefore, as no advocate will appear to demand\r\ndelay, Flora is certain to be condemned to-morrow night, and the release\r\nof Francisco may take place simultaneously--for when once the grand\r\ninquisitor shall have pronounced the extreme sentence, no human power\r\ncan reverse it. And now,\" added Nisida, \"but one word more. The grand\r\nvizier commanded you to dispatch a courier daily to Leghorn with full\r\nparticulars of all your proceedings; see that those accounts be of a\r\nnature to lull the treacherous Ibrahim into security--for, were he to\r\nlearn that his aunt and sister are in dread peril, he would be capable\r\nof marching at the head of all his troops to sack the city of Florence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not on that subject, lady,\" answered Demetrius. \"I will so amuse\r\nthe demon-hearted grand vizier by my dispatches, that he shall become\r\nexcited with joyous hopes--so that the blow--the dread blow which we are\r\npreparing for him--may be the more terribly severe.\"\r\n\r\nThe Greek then rose to take his leave of Donna Nisida; and Wagner,\r\nhaving closed the secret door as noiselessly as he had opened it,\r\nhurried away from the Riverola mansion bewildered and grieved at all he\r\nhad heard--for he could no longer conceal from himself that a very fiend\r\nwas incarnate in the shape of her whom he had loved so madly.\r\n\r\nHaving tossed on a feverish couch for upward of an hour,--unable to\r\nbanish from his mind the cold blooded plot which Nisida and Demetrius\r\nhad resolved upon in order to consign Flora Francatelli and her equally\r\ninnocent aunt to the stake,--Wagner at last slept through sheer\r\nexhaustion. Then Christianus Rosencrux appeared to him in a dream and\r\nsaid:--\"Heaven hath chosen thee as the instrument to defeat the\r\niniquitous purposes of Riverola in respect of two guiltless and\r\ndeserving women. Angelo Duras is an upright man; but he is deluded and\r\nmisled by the representations made to him by Nisida, through his\r\nbrother, the physician, relative to the true character of Flora. In the\r\nevening at nine o'clock, hie to Angelo Duras--command him in the name of\r\njustice and humanity, to do his duty toward his clients--and he will\r\nobey thee. Then, having performed this much, speed thou without delay to\r\nLeghorn, and seek the grand vizier, Ibrahim Pasha. To him shalt thou\r\nmerely state that Demetrius is a traitor, and that tremendous perils\r\nhang over the heads of the vizier's much-loved relatives. Manifest no\r\nhatred to the vizier on account of his late treacherous intention with\r\nregard to the honor of Nisida: for vengeance belongeth not to mortals.\r\nAnd in these measures only, of all the deeply ramified plots and designs\r\nwhich thou didst hear discussed between Nisida and Demetrius, shall thou\r\ninterfere. Leave the rest to Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Rosicrucians disappeared: and when Fernand awoke late\r\nin the day--for his slumber had been long and deep--he remembered the\r\nvision which he had seen, and resolved to obey the order he had\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nBeneath the massive and heavy tower of the Palazzo del Podesta, or Ducal\r\nPalace of Florence, was the tribunal of the holy inquisition. Small,\r\nlow, and terribly somber in appearance was this court--with walls of the\r\nmost solid masonry, an arched roof, and a pavement formed of vast blocks\r\nof dark-veined marble. Thither the light of heaven never penetrated; for\r\nit was situate far below the level of the earth, and at the very\r\nfoundation of that tower which rose, frowning and sullen, high above.\r\nIron lamps diffused a lurid luster around, rendering ghastly the\r\ncountenance alike of the oppressors and the oppressed; and when it was\r\ndeemed necessary to invest the proceedings with a more awe-inspiring\r\nsolemnity than usual, torches, borne by the familiars or officers of the\r\ninquisition, were substituted for these iron lamps. Over the\r\njudgment-seat was suspended a large crucifix. On one side of the court\r\nwere three doors,--one communicating with the corridor and flight of\r\nstone steps leading to and from the tribunal; the second affording\r\nadmission into the torture-chamber and the third opening to the prisons\r\nof the inquisition.\r\n\r\nIt was about seven o'clock in the evening, on the 26th of September,\r\nthat Flora Francatelli and her aunt were placed before the grand\r\ninquisitor, to be examined for the second time. When the familiars,\r\nhabited in their long, black, ecclesiastical dresses with the strange\r\ncowls or hoods shading their stern and remorseless countenances, led in\r\nthe two females from the separate cells in which they had been confined,\r\nthe first and natural impulse of the unhappy creatures was to rush into\r\neach other's arms;--but they were immediately torn rudely asunder, and\r\nso stationed in the presence of the grand inquisitor as to have a\r\nconsiderable interval between them.\r\n\r\nBut the glances which the aunt and niece exchanged, gave encouragement\r\nand hope to each other, and the sentiments which prompted those glances\r\nwere really cherished by the persecuted females; inasmuch as Father\r\nMarco, who had been permitted to visit them occasionally, dropped sundry\r\nhints of coming aid, and powerful, though invisible, protection--thereby\r\ncheering their hearts to some little extent, and mitigating the\r\nintensity of their apprehensions. Flora was very pale--but never,\r\nperhaps, had she appeared more beautiful--for her large blue eyes\r\nexpressed the most melting softness, and her dark brown hair hung\r\ndisheveled over her shoulders, while her bosom heaved with the agitation\r\nof suspense.\r\n\r\n\"Woman,\" said the grand inquisitor, glancing first to the aunt and then\r\nto the niece, his eyes, however, lingering upon the latter, \"know ye of\r\nwhat ye are accused? Let the younger speak first.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" answered Flora, in a firmer tone than might have been\r\nexpected from the feelings indicated by her outward appearance, \"when on\r\na former occasion I stood in the presence of your eminence, I expressed\r\nmy belief that secret enemies were conspiring, for their own bad\r\npurposes, to ruin my beloved relative and myself; and yet I call Heaven\r\nto witness my solemn declaration that knowingly and willfully we have\r\nwronged no one by word or deed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young woman,\" exclaimed the grand inquisitor, \"thou hast answered my\r\nquestions evasively. Wast thou not an inmate of that most holy\r\nsanctuary, the convent of Carmelite nuns? wast thou not there the\r\ncompanion of Giulia of Arestino? did not a sacrilegious horde of\r\nmiscreants break into the convent, headed or at least accompanied by a\r\ncertain Manuel d'Orsini who was the lover of the countess? was not this\r\ninvasion of the sacred place undertaken to rescue that guilty woman? and\r\ndid she not find an asylum at the abode of your aunt, doubtless with\r\nyour connivance, until the day of her arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"None of those circumstances, my lord,\" replied Flora, \"do I attempt to\r\ndeny: but it is so easy to give them a variety of colorings, some of\r\nwhich, alas! may seem most unfavorable to my venerable relative and to\r\nmyself. Oh, my lord, do with me what thou wilt,\" exclaimed Flora,\r\nclasping her hands together in a single paroxysm of anguish; \"but\r\nrelease that aged woman, suffer not my beloved aunt--my more than mother\r\nto be thus persecuted! have mercy, my lord, upon _her_--oh! have mercy,\r\ngreat judge, upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flora--dearest Flora,\" cried Dame Francatelli, the tears trickling fast\r\ndown her countenance, \"I do not wish to leave you--I do not seek to be\r\nset free--I will stay in this dreadful place so long as you remain a\r\nprisoner also; for though we are separated----\"\r\n\r\n\"Woman,\" exclaimed the grand inquisitor, not altogether unmoved by this\r\ntouching scene, \"the tribunal cannot take heed of supplications and\r\nprayers of an impassioned nature. It has to do with facts, not\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a slight sensation amongst the familiars\r\nstationed near the door of the judgment-hall; and an individual who had\r\njust entered the court, and who wore the black robe and the cap or toque\r\nof a counselor, advanced toward the grand inquisitor.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said the advocate, with a reverential bow, \"the day after the\r\narrest of these females, I submitted to the council of state a memorial,\r\nsetting forth certain facts which induced the president of the council\r\nto issue his warrant to order the postponement of the second examination\r\nof the two prisoners now before your eminence, until this day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the case has been postponed accordingly,\" answered the grand\r\ninquisitor. \"It will now proceed, unless reasonable cause be shown for\r\nfurther delay. The prisoners are obstinate. Instead of confessing their\r\nheinous crimes, and throwing themselves on the mercy of Heaven--for past\r\nthe hope of human mercy they are--they assuredly break forth into\r\nimpassioned language, savoring of complaint. Indeed, the younger\r\nattributes to the machinations of unknown enemies the position in which\r\nshe is placed. Yet have we positive proof that she was leagued with\r\nthose who perpetrated the sacrilege which ended in the destruction of\r\nthe Carmelite Convent; and the elder prisoner gave refuge not only to\r\nthe young girl, her niece, but also to a woman more guilty still--thus\r\nrendering herself infamous as one who encouraged and concealed the\r\nenemies of the church, instead of giving them up to the most holy\r\ninquisition. Wherefore,\" continued the grand inquisitor, \"it remaineth\r\nonly for me to order the prisoners to be put to the torture, that they\r\nmay confess their crimes and receive the condemnation which they merit.\"\r\n\r\nAt the terrible word \"_torture_,\" Dame Francatelli uttered a cry of\r\nagony--but it was even more on account of her beloved niece than\r\nherself; while Flora, endowed with greater firmness than her aunt, would\r\nhave flown to console and embrace her, had not the familiars cruelly\r\ncompelled the young maiden to retain her place.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said Angelo Duras--for he was the advocate who appeared on\r\nbehalf of the prisoners--\"I formally and earnestly demand a delay of\r\neight days ere this final examination be proceeded with.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" returned the grand inquisitor, while his words went\r\nlike ice-shafts to the hearts of the unhappy women. \"In addition to the\r\ncharges against them which I have already glanced at, it appeareth that\r\none Alessandro Francatelli, who is nearly related to them both, hath\r\nabjured the Christian faith and become a Mussulman. This fact was\r\nreported many months ago to the council of state: and in the cottage\r\nlately habited by the prisoners was found a costly set of jewels,\r\nornamented with sundry Moslem devices and symbols, all of which are\r\nhateful to the true Catholic. It is therefore natural to suppose that\r\nthey themselves have secretly abjured their country's religion, and have\r\nalready received the reward of their apostasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--never, never!\" exclaimed the aunt, clasping her hands together, and\r\nshowing more anguish by this cruel suspicion than by any other portion\r\nof the treatment which she had received at the hands of the inquisition.\r\n\r\nOn her side, Flora appeared to be astounded at the accusation made\r\nagainst her aunt and herself by the grand inquisitor.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said Angelo Duras, \"the very statement which has just been\r\nput forth by your eminence furnishes a new ground whereon I base my\r\nrequisition for a delay of eight days, in order to prepare a fitting\r\ndefense on behalf of the prisoners. The council of state is now sitting\r\nin deliberation on certain demands made by the newly arrived Ottoman\r\nenvoy, and should your eminence refuse my requisition for a delay, it\r\nwill be my duty forthwith to apply to that august body.\"\r\n\r\nThe grand inquisitor endeavored to reason with the advocate on the\r\ninconvenience of obstructing the business of the tribunal--but Angelo\r\nDuras, knowing that he had the law on his side, was firm; and the judge\r\nwas finally compelled to accord the delay. Flora and her aunt were\r\naccordingly conveyed back each to her separate cell; while Angelo Duras\r\nretired, murmuring to himself, \"I shall doubtless offend my brother by\r\nmy conduct in this respect, after my solemn promise to him to abandon\r\nthe cause of the Francatellis; but I prefer having obeyed that young man\r\nof godlike aspect and persuasive manner who visited me ere now to abjure\r\nme not to neglect my duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe next case that occupied the attention of the grand inquisitor on the\r\npresent occasion was that of the Jew Isaachar ben Solomon. The old man\r\nwas indeed a miserable spectacle. His garments hung loosely about his\r\nwasted and attenuated form--his countenance was wan and ghastly--but the\r\nfire of his eyes was not altogether quenched. He was heavily\r\nchained--and, as he walked between the two familiars who led him into\r\nthe tribunal, he could scarcely drag himself along. For the persecuted\r\nold man had been confined for nearly seven months in the prison of the\r\ninquisition; and during that period he had suffered acutely with the\r\ndamps of his dungeon--the wretched food doled out to him--and the\r\nanguish occasioned by conscious innocence unjustly accused of a dreadful\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n\"Jew,\" said the grand inquisitor, \"when last thou wast examined by me,\r\nthou didst obstinately refuse to confess thy grievous sins. This is the\r\nday for the final investigation of thy case: and thou may'st produce\r\nwitnesses in thy favor, if thou canst.\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" replied Isaachar ben Solomon, in a weak and tremulous voice,\r\n\"unless Heaven should work a miracle in my favor, I have no hope in this\r\nlife. I do not fear death, my lord; for, persecuted, reviled, despised,\r\naccused as I am, I can yet lay my hand on my heart and say I have never\r\ninjured a fellow-creature. But, my lord,\" he continued, his voice\r\ngrowing stronger with excitement, \"it is sufficient that I am a Jew to\r\ninsure my condemnation; and yet strange indeed is that Christian faith,\r\nor rather should I say, most inconsistent is the conduct of those who\r\nprofess it, in so far as this ruthless persecution of my race is\r\nconcerned. For where, my lord, is your charity, where is your tolerance,\r\nwhere is your mercy? If I be indeed involved in mental darkness, 'tis\r\nfor you to enlighten me with argument, not coerce me with chains. Never\r\nhave I insulted a Christian on account of his creed: wherefore should I\r\nbe insulted in mine? Granting that the Jew is in error, he surely\r\ndeserves pity, not persecution. For how came I by the creed which I\r\nprofess? Even as your lordship obtained yours, which is that of\r\nChristian. Our parents reared us each in the belief which they\r\nrespectively professed; and there is no more merit due to your eminence\r\nfor being a Christian, than there is blame to be attached to me for\r\nbeing a Jew. Had all the religions of the earth been submitted to our\r\nconsideration when we were children, and had it been said to each of us,\r\n'Select a faith for yourself,' then there might be some merit in\r\nchoosing the one most popular and the most assuredly conducive to\r\npersonal safety. But such was not the case, my lord; and I am a Jew for\r\nthe same reason that you are a Christian--and I cling to the creed of my\r\nforefathers even as you adhere tenaciously to that faith which your\r\nancestors have handed down to you. Reproach me not, then, because I am a\r\nJew. And now I will pass to another subject, my lord,\" continued\r\nIsaachar, becoming more and more animated as he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"I am accused of a fearful crime, of murder. The evidence rests upon the\r\nfact that stains of blood were observed upon the floor of a room in my\r\nhouse. The answer is simple. Two men--one of noble birth, the other a\r\nrobber, fought in the room; and the blood of one of them flowed from a\r\nslight wound. This is the truth--and yet I know that I am not believed.\r\nMerciful heavens! of what would you accuse me? Of murder!--and it was\r\nhinted, when last I stood before your eminence, that the Jews have been\r\nknown to slay Christian children as an offering to Heaven. My lord, the\r\nJews worship the same God as the Christians--for the Christians adopt\r\nthat book in which the Jews put faith. Then I appeal to your eminence\r\nwhether the God whom the Christians worship would delight in such\r\nsacrifices?--and as you must answer 'Nay,' the reply acquits the Jews\r\nalso of the hideous calumny sought to be affixed upon us. The Jews, my\r\nlord, are a merciful and humane race. The records of your tribunals will\r\nprove that the Jews are not addicted to the shedding of blood. They are\r\ntoo patient--enduring--and resigned, to be given to vengeance. Behold\r\nhow they cling to each other--how they assist each other in\r\ndistress;--and charity is not narrowed to small circles, my lord, it is\r\na sentiment which must become expansive, because it nourisheth itself\r\nand is cherished by those good feelings which are its only reward. Think\r\nyou, my lord, that if I saw a fellow-creature starving in the street, I\r\nshould wait to ask him whether he were a Christian, a Jew, or a\r\nMussulman? Oh! no--no; the world's bread was given for men of all\r\nnations and all creeds!\"\r\n\r\nIsaachar would have continued his address to the grand inquisitor; but\r\nsheer exhaustion compelled him to desist--and he would have sunk upon\r\nthe cold marble, had not the familiars supported him.\r\n\r\n\"By his own words is he convicted of disbelief in the most holy Catholic\r\nfaith,\" said the grand inquisitor. \"But I find, by a memorial which was\r\naddressed to me many mouths ago--indeed, very shortly after the arrest\r\nof this miserable unbeliever--and signed by Manuel Marquis of Orsini,\r\nthat the said marquis hath important evidence to give on behalf of the\r\nJew. Now, though Manuel d'Orsini be himself a prisoner of the holy\r\noffice, yet as he hath not yet been judged, he is a competent witness.\"\r\n\r\nOrders were then given to introduce the marquis; and Isaachar ben\r\nSolomon murmured to himself, \"Is it possible that the young man can have\r\nfelt sympathy for me? Ah, then I was not mistaken in him; in spite of\r\nhis dissipation and his wildness he possesses a generous heart.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the Marquis of Orsini was led into the judgment-hall.\r\nHe was chained;--but he carried his head erect--and, though his\r\ncountenance was pale and careworn, his spirit was not crushed. He bowed\r\nrespectfully, but not cringingly, to the grand inquisitor, and bestowed\r\na friendly nod of recognition upon the Jew.\r\n\r\n\"This memorial, dated in the month of March last, was signed by you?\"\r\nsaid the grand inquisitor interrogatively, as he displayed a paper to\r\nthe marquis.\r\n\r\n\"That memorial was signed by me,\" answered Orsini, in a firm tone, \"and\r\nI rejoice that your eminence has at length granted me an opportunity of\r\nexplaining the matter hinted at therein. Your eminence sits there, it is\r\npresumed, to administer justice; then let justice be done toward this\r\ninnocent man--albeit that he is a Jew--for solemnly do I declare that\r\nthe blood which stained the floor in Isaachar's house flowed from my\r\nright arm. And it may not be amiss to observe,\" continued the marquis,\r\n\"that the worthy Jew there did not only bind the wound for me with as\r\nmuch care as if I myself had been an Israelite, or he a Christian--but\r\nhe moreover offered me the aid of his purse; and therefore am I under\r\nobligations to him which I can never wholly discharge. In good sooth, my\r\nlord,\" added Manuel, in whom neither a lengthened imprisonment nor the\r\nawful solemnity of the present scene could entirely subdue the flippancy\r\nwhich was habitual to his speech,--\"in good sooth, my lord, he is a\r\nsplendid specimen of a Jew--and I pray your eminence to discharge him\r\nforthwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"This levity ill becometh you, Manuel d'Orsini,\" said the grand\r\ninquisitor; \"for you yourself are in terrible danger.\"\r\n\r\nThen, upon a signal given, the familiars conveyed the marquis back to\r\nhis dungeon: but ere he left the judgment-hall, he had the satisfaction\r\nof beholding the Jew's eyes fixed upon him with an expression of\r\nboundless gratitude and deep sympathy. Tears, too, were trickling down\r\nthe cheeks of the Israelite: for the old man thought within himself,\r\n\"What matters it if the rack dislocate my limbs? But it is shocking--oh!\r\nit is shocking to reflect that thy fellow-creatures, noble youth, shall\r\ndare to deface and injure that godlike form of thine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jew,\" suddenly exclaimed the grand inquisitor, \"I put no faith in the\r\ntestimony of the witness who has just appeared in thy favor. Confess thy\r\nsins--avow openly that thou hast murdered Christian children to obtain\r\ntheir blood for use in thy sacrifices--and seek forgiveness from Heaven\r\nby embracing the faith of Jesus!\"\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Israelite was so appalled by the open, positive, and\r\nundisguised manner in which an atrocious charge was revived against him,\r\nthat he lost all power of utterance, and stood stupefied and aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Away with him to the torture-chamber!\" cried the grand inquisitor, in a\r\nstern and remorseless tone.\r\n\r\n\"Monster!\" exclaimed the Jew, suddenly recovering his speech, as that\r\ndreadful mandate warned him that he would now require all his\r\nenergy--all his presence of mind:--\"monster!\" he repeated, in a voice\r\nindicative of loathing and contempt;--\"and thou art a Christian!\"\r\n\r\nThe familiars hurried Isaachar away to the torture-chamber, which, as we\r\nbefore stated, opened upon the tribunal. And terrible, indeed, was the\r\nappearance of that earthly hell--that terrestrial hades, invented by\r\nfiends in human shape--that den of horrors constituting, indeed, a\r\nfitting foretaste of trans-stygian torment! The grand inquisitor\r\nfollowed the victim and the familiars into this awful place: and, on a\r\nsignal being given by that high functionary, Isaachar was stripped of\r\nall his upper clothing, and stretched on the accursed rack. Then\r\ncommenced the torture--the agonizing torture by means of that infernal\r\ninstrument, a torture which dislocated the limbs, appeared to tear the\r\nmembers asunder, and produced sensations as if all the nerves of the\r\nbody were suddenly being drawn out through the brain.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou confess? and wilt thou embrace the Christian faith?\" demanded\r\nthe grand inquisitor from time to time.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to confess--I will not renounce the creed of my\r\nforefathers!\" answered Isaachar in a tone of bitter agony, as he writhed\r\nupon the rack, while every fresh shock and jerk of the infernal engine\r\nseemed as if it would tear the very life out of him. But the old man\r\nremained firm in the declaration of his innocence of the dreadful crime\r\nimputed to him: stanch also to his creed did he remain; and having\r\nendured the full extent of that special mode of torture, he was borne\r\nback to his dungeon, cruelly injured, with dislocated limbs, blood\r\nstreaming from his mouth and nostrils, and these terrible words of the\r\ngrand inquisitor ringing in his ears--\"Obstinate and impenitent one,\r\nSatan claims thee as his own; therefore art thou condemned to death by\r\nfire at the approaching _auto de-fe_!\"\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterward another human being lay stretched upon that\r\naccursed rack, and agonizing--oh! most agonizing were the female shrieks\r\nand rending screams which emanated from the lips of the tortured victim,\r\nbut which reached not beyond the solid masonry of those walls and the\r\nmassive iron-plated door. The white and polished arms were stretched out\r\nin a position fearfully painful beyond the victim's head, and the wrists\r\nwere fastened to a steel bar by means of a thin cord, which cut through\r\nflesh, muscle and nerve to the very bone! The ankles were attached in a\r\nsimilar manner to a bar at the lower end of the rack, and thus from the\r\nfemale's hands and feet thick clots of gore fell on the stone pavement.\r\nBut even the blood flowed not so fast from her lacerated limbs as\r\nstreamed the big drops of agony from her distorted countenance--that\r\ncountenance erst so beautiful, and so well beloved by thee, Manuel\r\nd'Orsini! For, oh! upon that rack lay stretched the fair and half-naked\r\nform of Giulia of Arestino, its symmetry convulsing in matchless\r\ntortures, the bosom palpitating awfully with the pangs of that earthly\r\nhell, and the exquisitely-modeled limbs enduring all the hideous pains\r\nof dislocation, as if the fibers that held them in their sockets were\r\ndrawn out to a tension at which they must inevitably snap in halves!\r\n\r\nBut who gazes on that awful spectacle? whose ears drink in those\r\nagonizing screams, as if they made a delicious melody? With folded arms,\r\ncompressed lips, and remorseless, though ashy pale countenance, the old\r\nLord of Arestino stands near the rack; and if his eyes can for a moment\r\nquit that feast which they devour so greedily, it is but to glance with\r\ndemoniac triumph toward Manuel d'Orsini, whom an atrocious refinement of\r\ncruelty, suggested by the vengeful count himself, has made a spectator\r\nof that appalling scene! And terrible are the emotions which rend the\r\nheart of the young marquis! But he is powerless--he cannot stretch forth\r\na hand to save his mistress from the hellish torments which she is\r\nenduring, nor can he even whisper a syllable to inspire her with courage\r\nto support them. For he is bound tightly--the familiars, too, have him\r\nin their iron grasp, and he is gagged! Nevertheless he can see, and he\r\ncan hear; he can behold the rending tortures of the rack--and he is\r\ncompelled to listen to the piercing screams which the victim sends\r\nforth. If he close his eyes upon the horrible spectacle, imagination\r\ninstantly makes it more horrible even still; and, moreover, in the true\r\nspirit of a chivalrous heart, he seeks by the tenderness of his glances\r\nto impart at least a gleam of solace to the soul of her who has\r\nundergone so much, and is suffering now so much more, through her fatal\r\nlove of him! The grand inquisitor, who is an intimate friend of the\r\nCount of Arestino, ministers well and faithfully to the infernal\r\nvengeance of that old Italian noble: for the remorseless judge urges on\r\nthe torturers to apply the powers of the rack to the fullest extent; and\r\nwhile the creaking sound of wheels mingles with the cracking noise of\r\ndislocating limbs, the Count of Arestino exclaims, \"I was once humane\r\nand benevolent, Giulia, but thy conduct has made me a fiend!\"\r\n\r\n\"A fiend!\" shrieked the tormented woman: \"Oh! yes--yes--thou art a\r\nfiend--a very fiend--I have wronged thee--but this vengeance is\r\nhorrible--mercy--mercy!--oh! for one drop of water--mercy--mercy!\"\r\n\r\nThe rack gave the last shock of which its utmost power was capable--a\r\nscream more dreadful, more agonizing, more piercing than any of its\r\npredecessors, rent this time the very walls of the torture-chamber: and\r\nwith this last outburst of mortal agony, the spirit of the guilty Giulia\r\nfled forever! Yet was not the vengeance of the Count of Arestino\r\nsatisfied; and the grand inquisitor was prepared to gratify the hellish\r\nsentiment to the fullest extent. The still warm and palpitating corpse\r\nof the countess was hastily removed from the rack: and the familiars\r\nstripped--nay, tore off the clothing of Manuel d'Orsini. The countenance\r\nof the young nobleman was now terribly somber, as if the darkest\r\nthoughts were occupying his inmost soul, and his eyes were bent fixedly\r\non the dreadful engine, to the tortures of which it appeared to be his\r\nturn to submit.\r\n\r\nThe familiars, in order to divest him of his garments, and also to\r\nstretch him in such a way on the rack that his arms might be fastened\r\nover his head to the upper end of that instrument, had removed the\r\nchains and cords which had hitherto bound him. And now the fatal moment\r\nseemed to be at hand, and the familiars already grasped him rudely to\r\nhurl him on the rack, when, as if suddenly inspired by a superhuman\r\nstrength, the young nobleman dashed the men from him; then, with\r\nlightning speed, he seized a massive iron bar that was used to move the\r\nwindlass of the rack, and in another instant, before a saving arm could\r\nintervene, the deadly instrument struck down the Count of Arestino at\r\nthe feet of the grand inquisitor, who started back with a cry of horror!\r\nThe next moment the marquis was again powerless and secure in the grasp\r\nof the familiars--but he had accomplished his purpose, he had avenged\r\nhis mistress and himself--and the old Lord of Arestino lay, with\r\nshattered skull, a corpse upon the cold pavement of the torture-chamber!\r\n\r\n\"Back--back with the murderer to his dungeon!\" exclaimed the grand\r\ninquisitor, in a tone of fearful excitement and rage. \"We must not\r\nafford him a chance of dying upon that engine of torture. No--no: the\r\nlingering flames of the _auto-da-fe_ are reserved for the Marquis\r\nd'Orsini!\"\r\n\r\nAnd in pursuance of the sentence thus pronounced, Manuel was hurried\r\naway to his dark and solitary cell, there to remain a prey to all the\r\ndreadful thoughts which the occurrences of that fatal evening were so\r\nwell calculated to marshal in horrible array to his imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these awful scenes were being enacted in the subterranes of the\r\nholy inquisition, Demetrius was actively engaged in directing those\r\nplans and effecting those arrangements which the scheming disposition of\r\nNisida of Riverola had suggested. We should observe that in the morning\r\nhe had sought and found Antonio, with whom he had so expertly managed\r\nthat the villain had fallen completely into the snare spread to entrap\r\nhim, and had not only confessed that he held at his disposal the liberty\r\nof the Count of Riverola, but had also agreed to deliver him up to the\r\nGreek. In a word, every thing in this respect took place precisely as\r\nNisida had foreseen. Accordingly, so soon as it was dark in the evening,\r\nsixty of the Ottoman soldiers quitted by two and threes the mansion\r\nwhich the Florentine Government had appropriated as a dwelling for the\r\nenvoy and his suit. The men whom Demetrius thus intrusted with the\r\nexecution of his scheme, and whose energy and fidelity he had previously\r\nsecured by means of liberal reward and promise of more, were disguised\r\nin different ways, but were all well armed. To be brief, so well were\r\nthe various dispositions taken, and so effectually were they executed,\r\nthat those sixty soldiers had concealed themselves in the grove\r\nindicated by their master, without having excited in the minds of the\r\nFlorentine people the least suspicion that anything unusual was about to\r\ntake place. It was close upon eleven o'clock at night, when Demetrius,\r\nafter having obtained a hasty interview with Nisida, whom he acquainted\r\nwith the progress of the plot, repaired to the grove wherein his men\r\nwere already distributed, and took his station in the midst of the knot\r\nof olives on the right of the huge chestnut tree which overhung the\r\nchasm.\r\n\r\nNearly a quarter of an hour elapsed, and naught was heard save the\r\nwaving of the branches and the rustling of the foliage, as the breeze of\r\nnight agitated the grove; but at the expiration of that brief period,\r\nthe sound of voices was suddenly heard close by the chestnut tree--not\r\npreceded by any footsteps nor other indication of the presence of\r\nmen--and thus appearing as if they had all at once and in an instant\r\nemerged from the earth.\r\n\r\nNot a moment had elapsed--no, not a moment--ere those individuals whose\r\nvoices were thus abruptly heard, were captured and secured by a dozen\r\nOttoman soldiers, who sprung upon them from the dense thickets around or\r\ndropped amongst them from the branches overhead--and so admirably was\r\nthe swoop made, that five persons were seized, bound and held powerless\r\nand incapable of resistance ere the echo of the cry of alarm which they\r\nraised had died away in the maze of the grove. And simultaneously with\r\nthe performance of this skillful maneuver, a shrill whistle was wafted\r\nfrom the lips of Demetrius through the wood, and as if by magic, a dozen\r\ntorches were seen to light up and numbers of men, with naked scimiters\r\ngleaming in the rays of those firebrands, rushed toward the spot where\r\nthe capture had been made. The effect of that sudden illumination--those\r\nflashing weapons--and that convergence of many warriors all toward the\r\nsame point, was striking in the extreme, and as the glare of the torches\r\nshone on the countenances of the four men in the midst of whom was\r\nFrancisco (the whole five, however, being held bound and powerless by\r\nthe Ottoman soldiers), it was evident that the entire proceeding had\r\ninspired the guilty wretches with the most painful alarm. Demetrius\r\ninstantly knew that the handsome and noble-looking young man in the\r\nmidst of the group of captives and captors, must be Don Francisco of\r\nRiverola, and he also saw at a glance that one of the ruffians with him\r\nwas Antonio. But he merely had leisure at the moment to address a word\r\nof reassurance and friendship to Nisida's brother--for, lo! the secret\r\nof the entrance to the robbers' stronghold was revealed--discovered!\r\nYes--there, at the foot of the tree, and now rendered completely visible\r\nby the glare of the torch-light, was a small square aperture, from which\r\nthe trap door had been raised to afford egress to the captured party.\r\n\r\n\"Secure that entrance!\" cried Demetrius, hastily; \"and hasten down those\r\nsteps, some dozen of you, so as to guard it well!\"--then, the instant\r\nthis command was obeyed he turned toward Francisco, saying, \"Lord of\r\nRiverola--am I right in thus addressing you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such is my name,\" answered Francisco; \"and if you, brave chief, will\r\nbut release me and lend me a sword, I will prove to thee that I have no\r\nparticular affection for these miscreants.\"\r\n\r\nDemetrius gave the necessary order--and in another moment the young\r\nCount of Riverola was not only free, but with a weapon in his hand. The\r\nGreek then made a rapid, but significant--fatally significant sign to\r\nhis men; and--quick as thought,--the three robbers and their confederate\r\nAntonio were strangled by the bowstrings which the Ottomans whipped\r\naround their necks. A few stifled cries--and all was over! Thus perished\r\nthe wretch Antonio--one of those treacherous, malignant, and avaricious\r\nItalians who bring dishonor on their noble nation,--a man who had sought\r\nto turn the vindictive feelings of the Count of Arestino to his own\r\npurposes, alike to fill his purse and to wreak his hateful spite on the\r\nRiverola family! Scarcely was the tragedy enacted, when Demetrius\r\nordered the four bodies to be conveyed down the steps disclosed by the\r\ntrap-door; \"for,\" said he, \"we will endeavor so to direct our\r\nproceedings that not a trace of them shall be left upon ground; as the\r\nFlorentines would not be well-pleased if they learnt that foreign\r\nsoldiers have undertaken the duties which they themselves should\r\nperform.\" Several of the Ottomans accordingly bore the dead bodies down\r\nthe steps; and Demetrius, accompanied by Francisco, followed at the head\r\nof the greater portion of the troops, a sufficient number, however,\r\nremaining behind to constitute a guard at the entrance of the\r\nstronghold.\r\n\r\nWhile they were yet descending the stone stairs, Demetrius seized the\r\nopportunity of that temporary lull in the excitement of the night's\r\nadventures, to give Francisco hasty but welcome tidings of his sister;\r\nand the reader may suppose that the generous-hearted young count was\r\noverjoyed to learn that Nisida was not only alive, but also once more an\r\ninmate of the ancestral home. Demetrius said nothing relative to Flora;\r\nand Francisco, not dreaming for a moment that his deliverer even knew\r\nthere was such a being in existence, asked no questions on that subject.\r\nHis anxiety was not, however, any less to fly to the cottage; for it\r\nmust be remembered that he was arrested first, on the 3d of July, and\r\nhad yet to learn all the afflictions which had fallen upon Flora and her\r\naunt--afflictions of the existence whereof he had been kept in utter\r\nignorance by the banditti during his long captivity of nearly three\r\nmonths in their stronghold. But while we are thus somewhat digressing,\r\nthe invaders are penetrating further into the stronghold. Headed by\r\nDemetrius and Francisco, and all carrying their drawn scimiters in their\r\nhands, the corps proceeded along a vast vaulted subterrane, paved with\r\nflag-stones, until a huge iron door, studded with nails, barred the way.\r\n\r\n\"Stay!\" whispered Francisco, suddenly recollecting himself, \"I think I\r\ncan devise a means to induce the rogues to open this portal, or I am\r\nmuch mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nHe accordingly seized a torch and hurried back to the foot of\r\nthe stone-steps; in the immediate vicinity of which he searched narrowly\r\nfor some object. At last he discovered the object of his\r\ninvestigation--namely a large bell hanging in a niche, and from which a\r\nstrong wire ran up through the ground to the surface. This bell\r\nFrancisco set ringing, and then hurried back to rejoin his deliverers.\r\nScarcely was he again by the side of Demetrius, when he saw that his\r\nstratagem had fully succeeded; for the iron door swung heavily round on\r\nits hinges--and in another moment the cries of terror which the two\r\nrobber-sentinels raised on the inner side, were hushed forever by the\r\nTurkish scimiters. Down another flight of steps the invaders then\r\nprecipitated themselves, another door, at the bottom, having been opened\r\nin compliance with the same signal which had led to the unfolding of the\r\nfirst--and now the alarm was given by the sentinels guarding the second\r\npost--those sentinels flying madly on, having beholden the immolation of\r\ntheir comrades. But Demetrius and Francisco speedily overtook them just\r\nas they emerged from another long vaulted and paved cavern-passage, and\r\nwere about to cross a plank which connected the two sides of a deep\r\nchasm in whose depths a rapid stream rushed gurgling on.\r\n\r\nInto the turbid waters the two fugitive sentinels were cast: over the\r\nbridge poured the invaders, and into another caverned corridor, hollowed\r\nout of the solid rock, did they enter, the torch-bearers following\r\nimmediately behind the Greek and the young count. It was evident that\r\nneither the cries of the surprised sentinels nor the tread of the\r\ninvaders had alarmed the main corps of the banditti; for, on reaching a\r\nbarrier formed by massive folding doors, and knocking thereat, the\r\nportals instantly began to move on their hinges--and in rushed the\r\nOttoman soldiers, headed by their two gallant Christian leaders. The\r\nrobbers were in the midst of a deep carouse in their magnificent\r\ncavern-hall, when their festivity was thus rudely interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"We are betrayed!\" thundered Lomellino, the captain of the horde; \"to\r\narms! to arms!\"\r\n\r\nBut the invaders allowed them no time to concentrate themselves in a\r\nserried phalanx, and tremendous carnage ensued. Surprised and taken\r\nunaware as they were, the banditti fought as if a spell were upon them,\r\nparalyzing their energies and warning them that their last hour was\r\ncome. The terrible scimiters of the Turks hewed them down in all\r\ndirections; some, who sought to fly, were literally cut to pieces.\r\nLomellino fell beneath the sword of the gallant Count of Riverola; and\r\nwithin twenty minutes after the invaders first set foot in the\r\nbanqueting hall, not a soul of the formidable horde was left alive!\r\n\r\nDemetrius abandoned the plunder of the den to his troops; and when the\r\nportable part of the rich booty had been divided amongst them, they\r\nreturned to their own grove, into which the entrance of the stronghold\r\nopened. When the subterrane was thus cleared of the living, and the dead\r\nalone remained in that place which had so long been their home, and was\r\nnow their tomb, Demetrius ordered his forces to disperse and return to\r\ntheir quarters in Florence in the same prudent manner which had\r\ncharacterized their egress thence a few hours before. Francisco and\r\nDemetrius, being left alone together in the grove, proceeded by\r\ntorchlight to close the trap-door, which they found to consist of a\r\nthick plate of iron covered with earth, so prepared, by glutinous\r\nsubstances no doubt, that it was hard as rock; and thus, when the trap\r\nwas shut down, not even a close inspection would lead to a suspicion of\r\nits existence, so admirably did it fit into its setting and correspond\r\nwith the soil all around.\r\n\r\nIt required, moreover, but a slight exercise of their imaginative powers\r\nto enable Demetrius and Francisco to conjecture that every time any of\r\nthe banditti had come forth from their stronghold they were accustomed\r\nto strew a little fresh earth over the entire spot, and thus afford an\r\nadditional precaution against the chance of detection on the part of any\r\none who might chance to stray in that direction. We may also add that\r\nthe trap-door was provided with a massive bolt which fastened it inside\r\nwhen closed, and that the handle of the bell-wire, which gave the signal\r\nto open the trap, was concealed in a small hollow in the old\r\nchestnut-tree. Having thus satisfied his curiosity by means of these\r\ndiscoveries, Demetrius accompanied Francisco to the city; and during\r\ntheir walk thither, he informed the young count that he was an envoy\r\nfrom the Ottoman Grand Vizier to the Florentine Government--that he had\r\nbecome acquainted with Nisida on board the ship which delivered her from\r\nher lonely residence on an island in the Mediterranean--and that as she\r\nhad by some means or other learnt where Francisco was imprisoned, he had\r\nundertaken to deliver him. The young count renewed his warmest thanks to\r\nthe chivalrous Greek for the kind interest he had manifested in his\r\nbehalf; and they separated at the gate of the Riverola mansion, into\r\nwhich Francisco hurried to embrace his sister; while Demetrius repaired\r\nto his own abode.\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Nisida and her brother Francisco was affecting in\r\nthe extreme; and for a brief space the softer feelings in the lady's\r\nnature triumphed over those strong, turbulent, and concentrated passions\r\nwhich usually held such indomitable sway over her. For her attachment to\r\nhim was profound and sincere; and the immense sacrifice she had made in\r\nwhat she conceived to be his welfare and interests had tended to\r\nstrengthen this almost boundless love.\r\n\r\nOn his side, the young count was rejoiced to behold his sister, whose\r\nstrange disappearance and long absence had filled his mind with the\r\nworst apprehensions. Yes, he was rejoiced to see her once more beneath\r\nthe ancestral roof; and, with a fond brother's pride, he surveyed her\r\nsplendid countenance, which triumph and happiness now invested with an\r\nanimation that rendered her surpassingly beautiful!\r\n\r\nA few brief and rapidly-given explanations were exchanged between them,\r\nby means of the language of the fingers,--Francisco satisfying Nisida's\r\nanxiety in respect to the success of her project, by which the total\r\nextermination of the banditti had been effected,--and she conveying to\r\nhim as much of the outline of her adventures during the last seven\r\nmonths as she thought it prudent to impart. They then separated, it\r\nbeing now very late; and, moreover, Nisida had still some work in hand\r\nfor that night. The moment Francisco was alone, he exclaimed aloud, \"Oh!\r\nis it possible that this dear sister who loves me so much, is really the\r\nbitter enemy of Flora? But to-morrow--to-morrow I must have a long\r\nexplanation with Nisida; and Heaven grant that she may not stand in the\r\nway of my happiness! Oh, Flora--dearest Flora, if you knew how deeply I\r\nhave suffered on your account during my captivity in that accursed\r\ncavern! And what must you have thought of my disappearance--my absence!\r\nAlas! did the same vengeance which pursued me wreak its spite also on\r\nthee, fair girl?--did the miscreant, Antonio, who boastingly proclaimed\r\nhimself to my face the author of my captivity, and who sullenly refused\r\nto give me any tidings of those whom I cared for, and of what was\r\npassing in the world without,--did he dare to molest thee? But suspense\r\nis intolerable, I cannot endure it even for a few short hours! No--I\r\nwill speed me at once to the dwelling of my Flora, and thus assuage her\r\ngrief and put an end to my own fears at the same time!\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus resolved, Francisco repaired to his own apartment, enveloped\r\nhimself in a cloak, secured weapons of defense about his person, and\r\nthen quitted the mansion, unperceived by a living soul. Almost at the\r\nsame time, but by another mode of egress--namely, the private staircase\r\nleading from her own apartments into the garden, and which has been so\r\noften mentioned in the course of this narrative--Donna Nisida stole\r\nlikewise from the Riverola palace. She was habited in male attire; and\r\nbeneath her doublet she wore the light but strong cuirass which she\r\nusually donned ere setting out on any nocturnal enterprise, and which\r\nshe was now particularly cautious not to omit from the details of her\r\ntoilet, inasmuch as the mysterious appearance of the muffled figure,\r\nwhich had alarmed her on the previous evening, induced her to adopt\r\nevery precaution against secret and unknown enemies. Whither was the\r\nLady Nisida now hurrying, through the dark streets of Florence?--what\r\nnew object had she in contemplation?\r\n\r\nHer way was bent toward an obscure neighborhood in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the cathedral; and in a short time she reached the house in\r\nwhich Dame Margaretha, Antonio's mother, dwelt. She knocked gently at\r\nthe door, which was shortly opened by the old woman, who imagined it was\r\nher son that sought admittance; for, though in the service of the Count\r\nof Arestino, Antonio was often kept abroad late by the various\r\nmachinations in which he had been engaged, and it was by no means\r\nunusual for him to seek his mother's dwelling at all hours.\r\n\r\nMargaretha, who appeared in a loose wrapper hastily thrown on, held a\r\nlamp in her hand; and when its rays streamed not on the countenance of\r\nher son, but showed the form of a cavalier handsomely appareled, she\r\nstarted back in mingled astonishment and fear. A second glance, however,\r\nenabled her to recognize the Lady Nisida; and an exclamation of wonder\r\nescaped her lips. Nisida entered the house, closed the door behind her,\r\nand motioned Dame Margaretha to lead the way into the nearest apartment.\r\nThe old woman obeyed tremblingly; for she feared that the lady's visit\r\nboded no good; and this apprehension on her part was not only enhanced\r\nby her own knowledge of all Antonio's treachery toward Count Francisco,\r\nbut also by the imperious manner, determined looks, and strange disguise\r\nof her visitress. But Margaretha's terror speedily gave way to\r\nindescribable astonishment when Nisida suddenly addressed her in a\r\nlanguage which not for many, many years, had the old woman heard flow\r\nfrom that delicious mouth!\r\n\r\n\"Margaretha,\" said Nisida, \"you must prepare to accompany me forthwith!\r\nBe not surprised to hear me thus capable of rendering myself\r\nintelligible by means of an organ on which a seal was so long placed. A\r\nmarvelous cure has been accomplished in respect to me, during my absence\r\nfrom Florence. But you must prepare to accompany me, I say; your son\r\nAntonio----\"\r\n\r\n\"My son!\" ejaculated the woman, now again trembling from head to foot,\r\nand surveying Nisida's countenance in a manner denoting the acutest\r\nsuspense.\r\n\r\n\"Your son is wounded--mortally wounded in a street skirmish----\"\r\n\r\n\"Wounded!\" shrieked Margaretha. \"Oh, dear lady--tell me all--tell me the\r\nworst! What has happened to my unfortunate son? He is dead--he is dead!\r\nYour manner convinces me that hope is past!\"\r\n\r\nAnd she wrung her hands bitterly, while tears streamed down her wrinkled\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\"No, he is not dead, Margaretha!\" exclaimed Nisida; \"but he is\r\ndying--and he implored me, by everything I deemed sacred, to hasten\r\nthither and fetch you to him, that he may receive your blessing and\r\nclose his eyes in peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"In peace!\" repeated the old woman bitterly: then, to herself she said,\r\n\"Donna Nisida suspects not his perfidy--knows not all his wickedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delay not,\" urged the lady, perceiving what was passing in her mind.\r\n\"You are well aware that my brother, who, alas! has disappeared most\r\nmysteriously, dismissed Antonio abruptly from his service many months\r\nago; but, whatever were the cause, it is forgotten, at least by me. So\r\ntarry not, but prepare to accompany me.\"\r\n\r\nMargaretha hastened to her bedroom, and reappeared in a few minutes,\r\ncompletely dressed and ready to issue forth.\r\n\r\n\"Keep close by me,\" said Nisida, as she opened the house-door; \"and\r\nbreathe not a word as we pass through the streets. I have reasons of my\r\nown for assuming a disguise, and I wish not to be recognized.\"\r\n\r\nMargaretha was too much absorbed in the contemplation of the afflicting\r\nintelligence which she had received, to observe anything at all\r\nsuspicious in these injunctions; and thus it was that the two females\r\nproceeded in silence through the streets leading toward the Riverola\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\nBy means of a pass-key Nisida opened the wicket-gate of the spacious\r\ngardens, and she traversed the grounds, Margaretha walking by her side.\r\nIn a few minutes they reached a low door, affording admission into the\r\nbasement-story of the palace, and of which Nisida always possessed the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\n\"Go first,\" said the lady, in a scarcely audible whisper; \"I must close\r\nthe door behind us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wherefore this way?\" demanded Margaretha, a sudden apprehension\r\nstarting up in her mind. \"This door leads down to the cellars.\"\r\n\r\n\"The officers of justice are in search of Antonio--and I am concealing\r\nhim for your sake,\" was the whispered and rapid assurance given by\r\nNisida. \"Would you have him die in peace in your arms, or perish on the\r\nscaffold?\"\r\n\r\nMargaretha shuddered convulsively, and hurried down the dark flight of\r\nstone steps upon which the door opened. Terrible emotions raged in her\r\nbosom--indescribable alarms, grief, suspicion, and also a longing\r\neagerness to put faith in the apparent friendship of Nisida.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hand,\" said the lady; and the hand that was thrust into\r\nhers was cold and trembling.\r\n\r\nThen Nisida hurried Margaretha along a narrow subterranean passage, in\r\nwhich the blackest night reigned; and, though the old woman was a prey\r\nto apprehensions that increased each moment to a fearful degree, she\r\ndared not utter a word either to question--to implore--or to\r\nremonstrate. At length they stopped; and Nisida, dropping Margaretha's\r\nhand, drew back heavy bolts which raised ominous echoes in the vaulted\r\npassage. In another moment a door began to move stubbornly on its\r\nhinges; and almost at the same time a faint light gleamed\r\nforth--increasing in power as the door opened wider, but still attaining\r\nno greater strength than that which a common iron lamp could afford.\r\nMargaretha's anxious glances were plunged into the cellar or vault to\r\nwhich the door opened, and whence the light came: but she saw no one\r\nwithin. It, however, appeared as if some horrible reminiscence,\r\nconnected with the place, came back to her startled mind; for, falling\r\non her knees, and clinging wildly to her companion, she cried in a\r\npiercing tone, \"Oh! lady, wherefore have you brought me hither?--where\r\nis my son?--what does all this horrible mystery mean? But, chiefly now\r\nof all--why, why are we here--at this hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments you shall know more!\" exclaimed Nisida; and as she\r\nspoke, with an almost superhuman strength she dragged, or rather, flung\r\nthe prostrate woman into the vault, rushing in herself immediately\r\nafterward, and closing the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Holy God!\" shrieked Margaretha, gazing wildly round the damp and naked\r\nwalls of solid masonry, and then up at the lamp suspended to the arched\r\nceiling, \"is this the place? But no! you are ignorant of all that; it\r\nwas not for that you brought me hither! Speak, lady, speak! Where is\r\nAntonio? What have I done to merit your displeasure? Oh, mercy! mercy!\r\nBend not those terrible glances upon me! Your eyes flash fire! You are\r\nnot Nisida--you are an evil spirit! Oh, mercy! mercy!\"\r\n\r\nAnd thus did the miserable woman rave, as, kneeling on the cold, damp\r\nground she extended her tightly-clasped hands in an imploring manner\r\ntoward Nisida, who, drawn up to her full height, was contemplating the\r\ngroveling wretch with eyes that seemed to shoot forth shafts of\r\ndevouring flame! Terrible, indeed, was the appearance of Nisida! Like to\r\nan avenging deity was she--no longer woman in the glory of her charms\r\nand the elegance of her disguise, but a fury--a very fiend, an\r\nimplacable demoness, armed with the blasting lightnings of infernal\r\nmalignity and hellish rancor!\r\n\r\n\"Holy Virgin, protect me!\" shrieked Margaretha, every nerve thrilling\r\nwith the agony of ineffable alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, call upon Heaven to aid you, vile woman!\" said Nisida, in a thick,\r\nhoarse, and strangely altered voice, \"for you are beyond the reach of\r\nhuman aid! Know ye whose remains--or rather the mangled portions of\r\nwhose remains--lie in this unconsecrated ground? Ah! well may you start\r\nin horror and surprise, for I know all--all!\"\r\n\r\nA terrific scream burst from the lips of Margaretha; and she threw her\r\nwild looks around as if she were going mad.\r\n\r\n\"Detestable woman!\" exclaimed Nisida, fixing her burning eyes more\r\nintently still on Margaretha's countenance: \"you are now about to pay\r\nthe penalty of your complicity in the most odious crimes that ever made\r\nnights terrible in Florence! The period of vengeance has at length\r\narrived! But I must torture ere I slay ye! Yes, I must give thee a\r\nforetaste of that hell to which your soul is so soon to plunge down!\r\nKnow, then, that Antonio--your son Antonio--is no more. Not three hours\r\nhave elapsed since he was slain--assassinated--murdered, if you will so\r\ncall it--and by my commands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! lady, have pity upon me--pity upon me, a bereaved mother!\" implored\r\nthe old woman, in a voice of anguish so penetrating, that vile as she\r\nwas, it would have moved any human being save Nisida. \"Do not kill\r\nme--and I will end my miserable days in a convent! Give me time to\r\nrepent of all my sins--for they are numerous and great! Oh! spare me,\r\ndear lady--have mercy upon me--have mercy upon me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What mercy had you on them whose mangled remains are buried in the\r\nground beneath your feet?\" demanded Nisida, in a voice almost suffocated\r\nwith rage. \"Prepare for death--your last moment is at hand!\" and a\r\nbright dagger flashed in the lamp-light.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy--mercy!\" exclaimed Margaretha, springing forward, and grasping\r\nNisida's knees.\r\n\r\n\"I know not what mercy is!\" cried the terrible Italian woman, raising\r\nthe long, bright, glittering dagger over her head.\r\n\r\n\"Holy God! protect me! Lady--dear lady, have pity upon me!\" shrieked the\r\nagonized wretch, her countenance hideously distorted, and appallingly\r\nghastly, as it was raised in such bitterly earnest appeal toward that of\r\nthe avengeress. \"Again I say mercy--mercy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Die, fiend!\" exclaimed Nisida; and the dagger, descending with\r\nlightning speed, sunk deep into the bosom of the prostrate victim. A\r\ndreadful cry burst from the lips of the wretched woman; and she fell\r\nback--a corpse!\r\n\r\n\"Oh! my dear--my well-beloved and never-to-be-forgotten mother!\" said\r\nNisida, falling upon her knees by the side of the body, and gazing\r\nintently upward--as if her eyes could pierce the entire building\r\noverhead, and catch a glimpse of the spirit of the parent whom she thus\r\napostrophized--\"pardon me--pardon me for this deed! Thou didst enjoin me\r\nto abstain from vengeance--but when I thought of all thy wrongs, the\r\ncontemplation drove me mad--and an irresistible power--a force which I\r\ncould not resist--has hurried me on to achieve the punishment of this\r\nwretch who was so malignant an enemy of thine; dearest mother, pardon\r\nme--look not down angrily on thy daughter!\"\r\n\r\nThen Nisida gave way to all the softer emotion which attended the\r\nreaction that her mind was now rapidly undergoing, after being so highly\r\nstrung, as for the last few hours it was--and her tears fell in\r\ntorrents. For some minutes she remained in her kneeling position, and\r\nweeping, till she grew afraid--yes, afraid of being in that lonely\r\nplace, with the corpse stretched on the ground--a place, too, which for\r\nother reasons awoke such terrible recollections in her mind.\r\n\r\nStarting to her feet--and neither waiting to extinguish the lamp, which\r\nshe herself had lighted at an early period of the night, nor to withdraw\r\nher dagger from the bosom of the murdered Margaretha--Nisida fled from\r\nthe vault, and regained her own apartment in safety, and unperceived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned, Nisida rose from a couch in which she had obtained\r\ntwo hours of troubled slumber, and, having hastily dressed herself,\r\nproceeded to the chamber of her brother Francisco.\r\n\r\nBut he was not there--nor had his bed been slept in during the past\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"He is searching after his Flora,\" thought Nisida. \"Alas, poor\r\nyouth--how it grieves me thus to be compelled to thwart thee in thy\r\nlove! But my oath--and thine interests, Francisco, demand this conduct\r\non my part. And better--better it is that thou shouldst hear from\r\nstrangers the terrible tidings that thy Flora is a prisoner in the\r\ndungeon of the inquisition, where she can issue forth only to proceed to\r\nthe stake! Yes--and better, too, is it that she should die, than that\r\nthis marriage shall be accomplished!\"\r\n\r\nNisida quitted the room, and repaired to the apartment where the morning\r\nrepast was served up.\r\n\r\nA note, addressed to herself, lay upon the table. She instantly\r\nrecognized the handwriting of Dr. Duras, tore open the billet, and read\r\nthe contents as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"My brother Angelo came to me very late last night and informed\r\n    me that a sense of imperious duty compelled him to change his\r\n    mind relative to the two women Francatelli. He accordingly\r\n    appeared on their behalf, and obtained a delay of eight days.\r\n    But nothing can save them from condemnation at the end of this\r\n    period, unless indeed immense interests be made on their account\r\n    with the duke. My brother alone deserves your blame, dear\r\n    friend; let not your anger fall on your affectionate and devoted\r\n    servant.\r\n\r\n                                               \"JERONYMO DURAS.\"\r\n\r\nNisida bit her lips with vexation. She now regretted she had effected\r\nthe liberation of Francisco before she was convinced that Flora was past\r\nthe reach of human mercy;--but, in the next moment she resumed her\r\nhaughty composure, as she said within herself, \"My brother may essay all\r\n_his_ influence: but mine shall prevail!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had she established this determination in her mind, when the\r\ndoor was burst open, and Francisco--pale, ghastly, and with eyes\r\nwandering wildly--staggered into the apartment.\r\n\r\nNisida, who really felt deeply on his account, sprung forward--received\r\nhim in her arms--and supported him to a seat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Nisida, Nisida!\" he exclaimed aloud, in a tone expressive of deep\r\nanguish; \"what will become of your unfortunate brother? But it is not\r\nyou who have done this! No--for you were not in Florence at the time\r\nwhich beheld the cruel separation of Flora and myself!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, throwing himself on his sister's neck, he burst into tears. He had\r\napostrophized her in the manner just related, not because he fancied\r\nthat she could hear or understand him; but because he forgot, in the\r\nmaddening paroxysms of his grief, that Nisida was (as he believed) deaf\r\nand dumb! She wound her arms round him--she pressed him to her\r\nbosom--she covered his pale forehead with kisses; while her heart bled\r\nat the sight of his alarming sorrow.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he started up--flung his arms wildly about--and exclaimed, in a\r\nfrantic voice, \"Bring me my steel panoply! give me my burgonet--my\r\ncuirass--and my trusty sword;--and let me arouse all Florence to a sense\r\nof its infamy in permitting that terrible inquisition to exist! Bring me\r\nmy armor, I say--the same sword I wielded on the walls of Rhodes--and I\r\nwill soon gather a trusty band to aid me!\"\r\n\r\nBut, overcome with excitement, he fell forward--dashing his head\r\nviolently upon the floor, before Nisida could save him. She pealed the\r\nsilver bell that was placed upon the breakfast-table, and assistance\r\nsoon came. Francisco was immediately conveyed to his chamber--Dr. Duras\r\nwas sent for--and on his arrival, he pronounced the young nobleman to be\r\nlaboring under a violent fever. The proper medical precautions were\r\nadopted; and the physician was in a few hours able to declare that\r\nFrancisco was in no imminent danger, but that several days would elapse\r\nere he could possibly become convalescent. Nisida remained by his\r\nbedside, and was most assiduous--most tender--most anxious in her\r\nattentions toward him; and when he raved, in his delirium, of Flora and\r\nthe inquisition, it went to her very heart to think that she was\r\ncompelled by a stern necessity to abstain from exerting her influence to\r\nprocure the release of one whose presence would prove of far greater\r\nbenefit to the sufferer than all the anodynes and drugs which the skill\r\nof Dr. Duras might administer!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nTHE SICK-ROOM--FLORENCE IN DISMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about an hour past daybreak on the 1st of October,--five days\r\nafter the incidents related in the three preceding chapters. Nisida,\r\nworn out with long watchings and vigils in her brother's chamber, had\r\nretired to her own apartment; but not before she had seen Francisco fall\r\ninto a sleep which, under the influence of a narcotic ordered by the\r\nphysician, promised to be long and soothing. The lady had not quitted\r\nthe chamber of the invalid ten minutes, when the door was slightly\r\nopened; and some one's looks were plunged rapidly and searchingly into\r\nthe room:--then the visitor, doubtless satisfied by the result of his\r\nsurvey, stole cautiously in.\r\n\r\nHe advanced straight up to the table which stood near the bed, drew a\r\nsmall vial from the bosom of his doublet--and poured its crystal\r\ncontents into the beverage prepared to quench the thirst of the invalid.\r\nThen, as he again secured the vial about his person, he murmured, \"The\r\nmedicament of Christian Rosencrux will doubtless work greater wonders\r\nthan those of Dr. Duras, skilled though the latter be!\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus mused to himself, the visitor shook Francisco gently; and\r\nthe young count awoke, exclaiming petulantly that he was athirst. A\r\ngoblet of the beverage containing the Rosicrucian fluid, was immediately\r\nconveyed to his lips, and he drank the refreshing draught with\r\neagerness.\r\n\r\nThe effect was marvelous, indeed;--a sudden tinge of healthy red\r\nappeared upon the cheeks a moment before so ashy pale--and fire once\r\nmore animated the blue eyes--and Francisco recovered complete\r\nconsciousness and self-possession for the first time since the dread\r\nmorning when he was attacked with a dangerous illness.\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes for a few minutes; and when he opened them again, he\r\nwas surprised to perceive by his bedside a young, well-attired, and very\r\nhandsome man, whose countenance appeared to be familiar to him.\r\n\r\n\"Count of Riverola,\" said the visitor, bending over him, and speaking in\r\na low but kind tone, \"despair not! Succor is at hand--and ere\r\nforty-eight hours shall have passed away, your well-beloved Flora will\r\nbe free!\"\r\n\r\nJoy lighted up the countenance of the young nobleman, as these\r\ndelightful words met his ears; and, seizing his consoler's hand, he\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks for this assurance! But, have we not met before?--or\r\nwas it in those wild dreams which have haunted my imagination that I\r\nhave seen thee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--we have met before, count,\" was the reply. \"Dost thou not remember\r\nFernand Wagner?\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco passed his hand across his brow, as if to settle his scattered\r\nthoughts: then, at the expiration of a few moments, he said: \"Oh! yes--I\r\nrecollect you--I know that I had conceived a great friendship for you,\r\nwhen some strange incident--I cannot remember what, and it is of no\r\nmatter--parted us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not excite yourself too much by racking your memory to decipher the\r\ndetails of the past,\" returned Wagner. \"I dare not stay another minute\r\nwith you now: therefore listen attentively to what more I have to say.\r\nYield yourself not up to despondency--on the contrary, cherish every\r\nhope that is dear to you. Within a few days Flora shall be yours!\r\nYes--solemnly do I assure you that all shall take place as I affirm. But\r\nYOUR agency is not needed to insure her liberation: Heaven will make use\r\nof OTHER means. Compose your mind, then,--and suffer not yourself to be\r\ntortured by vain fears as to the future. Above all, keep my visit to\r\nthee a profound secret--intimate not to thy sister Nisida that thou hast\r\nseen me. Follow my counsel in all these respects--and happiness is in\r\nstore for thee!\"\r\n\r\nFernand pressed the young count's hand warmly as he terminated these\r\nrapidly delivered injunctions, and then retreated from the chamber ere\r\nthe invalid had time to utter a syllable indicative of his gratitude.\r\n\r\nBut how different was Francisco now--how different did Nisida find him,\r\non her return to his room, from what he was when she had left him two\r\nhours before! Nor less was Dr. Duras astonished, at his next visit, to\r\nperceive that his patient had made in those two hours as rapid strides\r\ntoward convalescence as he could barely have hoped to see accomplished\r\nin a week.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to a hint rapidly conveyed by a signal from Nisida to the\r\nphysician, the latter touched gently upon the subject of Flora\r\nFrancatelli; but Francisco, resolute in his endeavors to follow the\r\nadvice of Fernand Wagner, and to avoid all topics calculated to excite,\r\nresponded briefly, and immediately spoke on another matter.\r\n\r\nBut he did not think the less deeply on that interesting subject. No; he\r\ncherished the image of his Flora, and the hope of being yet united to\r\nher, with an enthusiasm which a love so ardent as his passion alone\r\ncould feel.\r\n\r\nAnd Nisida congratulated herself on the conviction which she now very\r\nnaturally entertained, that he had resigned himself to the loss of the\r\nyoung maiden, and was exerting his utmost to banish her altogether from\r\nhis memory!\r\n\r\nThroughout the day Francisco continued to improve rapidly, and on the\r\nfollowing morning he was enabled to leave his couch. Indeed, his\r\nrecovery was so marvelously quick that Dr. Duras considered it to be a\r\nperfect phenomenon in the history of medicine; and Nisida looked upon\r\nthe physician, whom she conceived to be the author of this remarkable\r\nchange, with unfeigned admiration.\r\n\r\nIt was verging toward the hour of sunset, the 2d of October, when a\r\nrumor of a most alarming nature circulated with the celerity of\r\nwild-fire through the city of Florence. At first the report was received\r\nwith contemptuous incredulity; but by degrees--as circumstances tended\r\nto confirm it--as affrighted peasants came flying into the town from\r\ntheir country homes, bearing the dread tidings, the degenerate and\r\nvoluptuous Florentines gave way to all the terrors which, in such cases,\r\nwere too well adapted to fill the hearts of an emasculated people with\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\nFor, while the dwellers of the City of Flowers were thinking only of the\r\ngay festival which invariably commenced their winter season, while the\r\nnobles and wealthy burghers were whiling their time pleasantly in the\r\nregilding and decoration of their palaces or mansions, while the duke\r\nwas projecting splendid banquets, and the members of the council of\r\nstate were dreaming of recreation and enjoyment, rather than of the\r\nduties of office, while, too, preparations were being made for the\r\napproaching _auto-da-fe_--that terrible spectacle which the inquisition\r\nannually offered to the morbid tastes of a priest-ridden people--while,\r\nin a word, Florence seemed wrapped up in security and peace--at such a\r\nmoment the astounding intelligence arrived, that a mighty army was\r\nwithin a few hours' march of the sovereign city of Tuscany!\r\n\r\nYes; this was the news that suddenly spread confusion and dismay\r\nthroughout Florence, the news which told how the Ottoman fleet, for some\r\ndays past moored off the port of Leghorn, had vomited forth legions, and\r\nhow the formidable force was approaching at a rapid rate, under the\r\ncommand of the grand vizier in person, the seraskier and sipehsalar of\r\nthe armies of the sultan!\r\n\r\nThe moment these things were bruited abroad in the city, Demetrius, the\r\nGreek, fled secretly; for he too well understood that his treacherous\r\nintentions had, in some unaccountable manner, transpired, and reached\r\nthe ears of Ibrahim Pasha. Nisida was perfectly astounded; and, for the\r\nfirst time in her life, she felt her energies paralyzed--all her powers\r\nof combination suddenly laid prostrate. As for Francisco, he could not\r\nhelp thinking that the invasion of Italy by the Turks was connected with\r\nthe succor so mysteriously, but confidently promised by Wagner; although\r\nhe was not only ignorant of the relationship subsisting between the\r\ngrand vizier and his beloved Flora, but was even unaware of the fact\r\nthat this high functionary was the same Ibrahim whose prisoner he had\r\nbeen for a few hours on a former occasion in the Island of Rhodes.\r\n\r\nThe council of state assembled to deliberate upon the proper course\r\nwhich should be adopted at so critical a moment; but when the resources\r\nof Florence and the means of resisting the invaders were scrutinized,\r\nwhen it was discovered that there were not three thousand soldiers to\r\ndefend the place, nor arms sufficient to equip more than fifteen hundred\r\nvolunteers in addition to the regular force, all idea of attempting to\r\nmake a stand against an army which was in reality twenty thousand\r\nstrong, but which the exaggerations of fear had trebled in amount, was\r\nultimately abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe sun went down, and was succeeded by no illuminations that night.\r\nFlorence was in mourning. A spell had fallen upon the City of Flowers;\r\nher streets were deserted; and within the houses, those who possessed\r\nwealth were busily engaged in concealing their gold and jewels in\r\ncellars, holes dug in the ground, or at the bottom of wells. The general\r\nconsternation was terrific indeed; and the solemn stillness which\r\nprevailed throughout the town so lately full of animation and happiness\r\nwas even more dreadful than that which had accompanied the plague two\r\ncenturies before.\r\n\r\nIt was near midnight when messengers from the grand vizier, who was now\r\nwithin three miles' march of the city, arrived at the western gate, and\r\ndemanded admission, that they might obtain an immediate audience of the\r\nduke. The request was directly complied with, and the envoys were\r\nconducted to the palazzo, where the prince immediately assembled the\r\ncouncil of state to receive them, himself presiding.\r\n\r\nThe audience was in other respects strictly private; but the nature of\r\nthe interview was soon proved to have been most unexpectedly pacific;\r\nfor two hours after the reception of the envoys, criers proceeded\r\nthroughout the city, proclaiming the joyful news that the grand vizier\r\nhad of his own accord proposed such terms as the council of state had\r\nnot hesitated to accept.\r\n\r\nThus, at two o'clock in the morning, were the Florentines at first\r\nalarmed by hearing the monotonous voices of the criers breaking upon the\r\nsolemn stillness; but their fear changed into gladness ineffable, ere\r\nthose functionaries had uttered a dozen words of the proclamation which\r\nthey were intrusted to make.\r\n\r\nWhat the terms were did not immediately transpire; but two circumstances\r\nwhich occurred ere it was daybreak, and which, though conducted with\r\nconsiderable secrecy, nevertheless soon became generally known--these\r\ncircumstances, we say, afforded ample scope for comment and gossip.\r\n\r\nThe first was the occupation of the Riverola Palace by the Ottoman\r\nsoldiers who had accompanied Demetrius as an escort, and whom he had\r\nleft in Florence; and the second was the fact that two females, closely\r\nmuffled up, were removed from the prison of the inquisition, and\r\ndelivered over to the charge of the grand vizier's messengers, who\r\nconveyed them out of the city.\r\n\r\nBut the curiosity excited by these incidents was absorbed in the general\r\nanxiety that was evinced by the Florentine people to feast their eyes\r\nwith the grand, interesting, and imposing spectacle which the dawn of\r\nday revealed to their view.\r\n\r\nFor, far as the eye could reach, on the western side of Florence, and\r\ncommencing at the distance of about a quarter of a mile from the city, a\r\nmass of innumerable tents and pavilions showed where the Ottoman army\r\nwas encamped! Myriads of banners, of all colors, floated from the tall\r\njavelins to which they were affixed before the entrance of the chief\r\nofficers' tents, and in front of the entire encampment waved, at the\r\nsummit of a spear planted in the ground, the three crescents, which\r\ninvariably accompany the march of a Turkish army. The sunbeams glittered\r\non thousands of bright crescents; and the brazen pommels of the mounted\r\nsentinels' saddles shone like burnished gold. It was, indeed, a grand\r\nand imposing spectacle:--and the din of innumerable voices mingling with\r\nthe sounds of martial music, reached the ears of those Florentines who,\r\nmore daring than the rest, advanced nearly up to the outposts of the\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, a scene of profound and touching interest had taken\r\nplace in the gorgeous pavilion of the grand vizier.\r\n\r\nWhile it was yet dark--and ere that martial panorama of tents and\r\npavilions developed itself to the admiring and astonished eyes of the\r\nFlorentines--two females, closely muffled in handsome cashmere shawls,\r\nwhich had been presented to them for the purpose, were treading the\r\nOttoman encampment, under the guidance of the messengers to whom they\r\nhad been consigned.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to inform the reader that these females were the\r\nelder Signora Francatelli and her beautiful niece Flora.\r\n\r\nTheir sudden and most unexpected deliverance from the terrible dungeons\r\nof the inquisition, and the profound respect with which they were\r\ntreated by those into whose charge the familiars of the holy office had\r\nsurrendered them, inspired them with the most lively joy; and their\r\ncongratulations were expressed by frequent pressures of each other's\r\nhands as they proceeded in company with their guides. But they knew not\r\nby whom, or how, nor wherefore they had been released--and yet a vague\r\nsuspicion, founded solely on the fact that their conductors wore the\r\nOttoman garb, that Alessandro must be in some way connected with the\r\nmatter, had entered their minds. It was, at all events, clear that no\r\nharm was intended them, for they were not treated as prisoners, and thus\r\nthey hastened on in confidence and hope.\r\n\r\nIt was not until they had left the city some distance behind, that the\r\nbright moon showed them a confused mass of white objects in front; and\r\nthey were both marveling what the strange and unknown spectacle could\r\nbe, when their party was suddenly challenged by the sentries of an\r\noutpost. The leader of the little escort gave the watchword; and now, as\r\nthe two females drew nearer to the encampment, the mass of white objects\r\nbecame more shapely, until, in a few minutes, the pointed tops of the\r\ntents and pavilions stood out in strong relief against the now purple\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nWhat could this unusual spectacle mean? They were still in the dungeons\r\nof the inquisition when the alarm, caused by an approaching army, had\r\ncirculated through Florence; and the rumor had not reached their ears.\r\nFor the first time since the moment of their release they now hung back,\r\nand manifested signs of fear.\r\n\r\n\"Be not terrified, ladies,\" said the chief of the escort, speaking in\r\nexcellent Italian; \"ye have no cause for apprehension! Before you spread\r\nthe innumerable tents of the Ottoman army; and it is to the presence of\r\nthis mighty host that ye are indebted for your freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"But whither are you taking us?\" inquired Flora, scarcely reassured.\r\n\r\n\"To the pavilion of his Highness, Ibrahim-Pasha, the grand vizier of the\r\nglorious Sultan Solyman,\" answered the Turk; \"and at the hands of that\r\npowerful minister ye will receive naught but honorable and kind\r\ntreatment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Know you, signor,\" inquired Flora, \"if there be in the Ottoman camp a\r\nyoung man who, when a Christian,\" she added, with a profound sigh, \"bore\r\nthe name of Alessandro Francatelli?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is such a young man,\" responded the Turkish messenger; \"and you\r\nwill see him presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! is it then to him that we owe our deliverance?\" demanded the\r\nbeauteous maiden, her heart fluttering with varied emotions at the idea\r\nof meeting her brother. \"Is he attached to the person of that mighty man\r\nwhom you denominate the grand vizier? and shall we see him in the\r\npavilion of his highness?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see him in the pavilion of his highness,\" answered the Turk.\r\n\r\n\"And the grand vizier himself--is he a good, kind man?\" asked Flora. \"Is\r\nmy brother--I mean Alessandro--a favorite with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that the mighty Ibrahim loves no man more than Alessandro\r\nFrancatelli, lady,\" said the Turk, highly amused by these questions\r\nwhich were put to him, although his manner was respectful and calm.\r\n\r\n\"Then there is a chance that Alessandro will rise in the service of the\r\nsultan?\" continued Flora, naturally anxious to glean all the information\r\nshe could respecting her brother.\r\n\r\n\"There is not a more enviable personage in the imperial service than he\r\nwhom you style Alessandro Francatelli.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven be thanked that he is so prosperous, poor boy!\" exclaimed the\r\naunt, who had been an attentive listener to the preceding discourse.\r\n\"But your grand vizier, signor, must be very powerful to have a great\r\narmy at his disposal.\"\r\n\r\n\"The grand vizier, lady,\" returned the Ottoman envoy, \"is second only to\r\nthe sultan, and in him we see a reflection of the imperial majesty. At a\r\nsign from the great and potent Ibrahim every scimiter throughout this\r\nhost of twenty thousand men would leap from its sheath in readiness to\r\nstrike where and at whom he might choose to order. Nay, more, lady--he\r\nhas the power to gather together mighty armies, so numerous that they\r\nwould inundate Christendom as with a desolating sea. Allah be thanked!\r\nthere is no limit to the power of the mighty Ibrahim so long as he\r\nholdeth the seals of his great office.\"\r\n\r\nThe two females made no further observation aloud; but they thought\r\nprofoundly on all that they had just heard. For in a short time they\r\nwere to stand in the presence of this puissant chief whom the Ottomans\r\nseemed to worship as a god, and who wielded a power which placed him on\r\na level with the proudest potentates in the Christian world.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the little party had entered the precincts of the\r\nOttoman encampment, a complete city of tents and pavilions, ranged in\r\nthe most admirable order, and with all the regularity of streets.\r\n\r\nA solemn silence prevailed throughout the camp, interrupted only by the\r\nmeasured pace and the occasional challenge of sentinels.\r\n\r\nAt length Flora and her aunt perceived, in the clear moonlight, a\r\npavilion loftier, larger, and more magnificent than any they had yet\r\nseen. The pinnacle glittered as if it were tipped with a bright star;\r\nthe roof was of dazzling whiteness; and the sides were of dark velvet,\r\nrichly embroidered with gold. It stood in the midst of a wide space, the\r\ncircumjacent tents forming a complete circle about it. Within this\r\ninclosure of tents the sentries were posted at very short intervals; and\r\ninstead of walking up and down, they stood motionless as statues, their\r\nmighty scimiters gleaming in the moonlight.\r\n\r\nIn profound silence did the little party proceed toward the entrance of\r\nthe vast pavilion, which the females had no difficulty in discerning to\r\nbe the habitation of the potent and dreaded chief into whose presence\r\nthey were now repairing.\r\n\r\nIn front of this splendid tent floated two large banners, each from the\r\nsummit of a tall javelin, the head of which was of burnished gold. One\r\nof these enormous flags was green; the other was blood-red. The first\r\nwas the sacred standard of the Prophet Mohammed, and accompanied the\r\ngrand vizier in his capacity of representative and vice-regent of the\r\nsultan; and the latter was the banner which was always planted in front\r\nof the pavilion inhabited by the seraskier, or commander-in-chief of the\r\nOttoman army.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the vast tent stood four mounted sentinels, horses\r\nand men alike so motionless that they seemed to be as many equestrian\r\nstatues.\r\n\r\n\"In a few moments,\" whispered the leader of the little escort to the two\r\nfemales, \"you will be in the presence of the grand vizier, who will\r\nreceive you alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Alessandro Francatelli?\" inquired Flora, in a tone of\r\ndisappointment, \"will he not be there also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, you shall behold him shortly,\" answered the Turk; and passing\r\nbehind the mounted sentinels, he drew aside the velvet curtain, at the\r\nsame time bidding Flora and her aunt enter the pavilion.\r\n\r\nA blaze of light bursting forth from the interior of the magnificent\r\ntent dazzled and bewildered them, as the Ottoman gently gushed them\r\nonward--for they hung back in vague and groundless alarm.\r\n\r\nThe curtain was instantly closed behind them; and they now found\r\nthemselves inside the gorgeous abode of the grand vizier. The pavilion\r\nwas decorated in the most sumptuous manner. Crystal chandeliers were\r\nsuspended to the spars which supported the canvas ceiling; and the\r\npillars which supported those spars were gilt and inlaid with\r\nmother-of-pearl. Rich sofas placed around the sides--vases, some\r\ncontaining flowers and others delicious perfumes--tables laden with\r\nrefreshments of the most exquisite kind,--in a word, all the evidences\r\nof enormous wealth and all the accessories of luxurious splendor were\r\ndisplayed in this sumptuous abode.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of the pavilion was seated an individual, whom, by\r\nthe intimation they had already received, and by the magnificence of his\r\nattire, Flora and her aunt immediately knew to be the grand vizier. He\r\nsoon granted them the opportunity they so anxiously awaited, and it was\r\nnot a great while ere they found themselves completely reassured, and\r\nconversing with a freedom which they had hardly hoped would characterize\r\ntheir interview.\r\n\r\nBut who can describe the wonder and amazement which overwhelmed Flora\r\nand her aunt, when, in the person of the grand vizier, was revealed to\r\nthem the long absent brother and nephew, Alessandro Francatelli!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to give in detail the events which were narrated in their\r\nconversation. After a long and interesting recapitulation of the\r\nthrilling events which had attended them thus far, they turned to that\r\nmore immediate matter which lay nearest their hearts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count of Riverola at length joined the party, the young\r\nnobleman, taking Flora's hand, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"I am anxious to secure this jewel as soon as possible. Our union may be\r\ncelebrated privately and without useless pomp and ceremony; a few hours\r\nhence may see us allied to part no more. I have a friend in\r\nFlorence--Fernand Wagner----\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he be your friend, count, you cannot possess one more likely to\r\nbe sincere!\" exclaimed the vizier.\r\n\r\n\"He has, indeed, proved a warm friend to me,\" continued Francisco. \"Two\r\ndays ago I was stretched upon a bed of sickness--delirious, my mind\r\nwandering, and my reason gone----\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens!\" cried Flora, shuddering from head to foot, and\r\ncontemplating her intended husband with the deepest solicitude.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was in a desperate state,\" said the count. \"But Wagner came--he\r\nbreathed words of hope in my ears, and I recovered rapidly; so rapidly\r\nand so completely that I feel not as if I had ever known indisposition\r\nsave by name. I was, however, about to observe that there is an oratory\r\nin Signor Wagner's mansion; and there may the ceremony be performed.\r\nFernand is, moreover, well acquainted with the language by which the\r\ndeaf and dumb communicate their ideas; and through friendship for me he\r\nwill break the tidings of my marriage to my sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it as you propose,\" said the grand vizier; then, after a moment's\r\npause, he added, speaking in a low and mysterious whisper: \"and if you\r\nwill not shrink from the contact of the renegade at the altar of God--a\r\nrenegade in name only, and not in heart--a renegade to suit his worldly\r\npurposes, and not from conviction--then shall I be present at the\r\nceremony. Yes,\" he continued, perceiving that his aunt, his sister, and\r\nthe young count surveyed him with mingled pleasure and amazement--\"yes,\r\nin a deep disguise I will quit the encampment and enter Florence, for it\r\nwould grieve me deeply to be excluded from the solemn scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest Alessandro--for thus you will permit me still to call you,\"\r\nexclaimed his aunt, \"your words have made my happiness complete. Oh! you\r\nare still a Christian in heart, thank God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for worlds would I that you should be absent from the ceremony\r\nwhich makes your sister the Countess of Riverola!\" exclaimed Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements so happily come to and so amicably digested, were now\r\nto be carried into effect. The expectant bridegroom accordingly took a\r\ntemporary leave of the vizier, Flora and the aunt, and returned to the\r\ncity to seek his friend Fernand Wagner, it being understood that those\r\nwhom he had just left should meet him at that signor's mansion by\r\nmid-day.\r\n\r\nThe morning was now breaking: and every roof top in Florence was crowded\r\nwith persons anxious to obtain a view of the encampment, as we have\r\nstated at the close of the preceding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plans detailed in the preceding chapter,\r\nFrancisco and Flora, accompanied by the good dame Francatelli, and\r\npreceded by a suitable guard, now departed from the gorgeous pavilion of\r\nthe grand vizier, on their way to the mansion of Wagner.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the walls of the city, the Ottoman guard left them, and\r\nretraced their steps to the Turkish encampment, while our little party\r\nproceeded on its way through the now crowded streets, and soon arrived\r\nat the residence of Wagner.\r\n\r\nWith many congratulations did Fernand receive them; and being informed\r\nof the purport of their visit, hastened to acquaint his chaplain of the\r\nduties that were required of him; and before the sun was an hour higher\r\nin the heavens, Francisco, Count of Riverola, and Flora Francatelli were\r\njoined together in the indissoluble bonds of wedlock.\r\n\r\nIt was now, for the first time since his recovery, that the recollection\r\nof the solemn oath Francisco had made to his dying father came across\r\nhis mind--that on that day and that hour in which he was married, he and\r\nhis bride should visit the secret chamber: and he hurriedly told Wagner\r\nthat it was of the utmost importance that he should be at the Riverola\r\npalace within the hour; and at the same time he requested his kind\r\nfriend to accompany him.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the Riverola palace, the party were instantly admitted,\r\nnotwithstanding that the Turkish soldiers placed there by the grand\r\nvizier still guarded the gates: and Francisco proceeded alone to his\r\nsister's apartment, where he found her sitting, busied in conjecturing\r\nthe cause of her recent detention--for Ibrahim, on the completion of the\r\nmarriage ceremony, of which he had been an unseen observer, had given\r\norders to free her from all restraint on her person.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving Francisco, Nisida tenderly embraced him; and by signs he\r\ninformed her that a person wished to be admitted to her presence. Having\r\nsignified her acquiescence, Francisco retired, and in a few moments\r\nreturned, leading by the hand his blushing bride, while Wagner followed,\r\na few paces in the rear.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Nisida's eyes fallen on the form of Flora, than she\r\nstarted from her seat, her eyes flashing with concentrated hate, and her\r\nhaughty lip curled in withering contempt, for well she guessed the\r\npurport of her visit: but the next moment her eyes fell on the advancing\r\nform of her adored Wagner--and those eyes, lit up as with the fires of\r\nhell, lost their demoniac glare in the beams of love which gleamed in\r\ntheir dark depths; and her lip of scorn was changed into an enchanting\r\nsmile of the sweetest welcome--a transition from hate to love, a change\r\nof feelings as well as features of which woman, loving woman, alone is\r\ncapable--and the next moment, regardless of the presence of Francisco\r\nand Flora, she rushed into the arms of her long-lost, her adored Wagner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNisida was now acquainted with the marriage of her brother, the secret\r\nchamber had been visited, the manuscript brought forth to be read; but\r\none of the party that but a few moments before occupied that room was no\r\nmore--_Fernand Wagner was dead_! True to the letter were the words of\r\nthe founder of the order of the Rosy Cross, that \"the spell which the\r\nEvil One hath cast upon thee, Fernand Wagner, shall be broken only on\r\nthat day and that hour when thine eyes shall behold the bleached\r\nskeletons of two innocent victims suspended to the same beam.\"\r\n\r\nFlora and Francisco had visited the secret chamber alone, but the scream\r\nof horror which came from the bride on seeing the spectacle which there\r\npresented itself to her, brought Wagner and Nisida to their side.\r\nInstantly on seeing the skeletons, the prophecy of Rosencrux rushed on\r\nthe mind of Wagner; a complete revolution came over his whole frame,\r\nbeautiful visions floated before his eyes, as of angels waiting to\r\nreceive him and herald him to eternal glory; then stretching forth his\r\narms, as if to embrace something immaterial, he fell heavily to the\r\nearth, and in a few moments he had breathed his last in the arms of\r\nNisida.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to the reading of the manuscript, and pass over a\r\ndetail of the indescribable agony that rent the heart of Nisida on\r\nseeing her beloved Wagner a corpse, and the revulsion of her feelings on\r\nbeholding the loathsome change that came over the face and form of the\r\nonce god-like Fernand, a repetition of which would grate too harshly on\r\nthe feelings of the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\"In order that you, Francisco--and she who as your bride, shall\r\naccompany you on your visit to the secret cabinet wherein you are\r\ndestined to find this manuscript--in order, I say, that you may both\r\nfully comprehend the meaning of the strange and frightful spectacle\r\nthere prepared to meet your eyes, it is necessary that I should enter\r\ninto a full and perfect detail of certain circumstances, the study of\r\nwhich will, I hope, prove beneficial to the lady whom you may honor with\r\nthe proud name of Riverola.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1494 I visited Naples on certain pecuniary business, an\r\nintimation of which I found amongst the private papers of my father, who\r\nhad died about ten months previously. I was then just one-and-twenty,\r\nand had not as yet experienced the influence of the tender passion. I\r\nhad found the ladies of Florence so inveterately given to intrigue, and\r\nhad seen so many instances in which the best and most affectionate of\r\nhusbands were grossly deceived by their wives, that I had not only\r\nconceived an abhorrence at the idea of linking my fortunes with one of\r\nmy own countrywomen, but even made a solemn vow that if ever I married,\r\nmy choice should not fall upon a Tuscan. It was with such impressions as\r\nthese that I quitted Florence on the business to which I have alluded:\r\nand I cared not if I never returned thither--so shallow, heartless, and\r\nsuperficial did its gay society appear to me.\r\n\r\n\"On my arrival at Naples I assumed the name of Cornari, and,\r\nrepresenting myself as a young man of humble birth and moderate fortune,\r\nmixed in the best society that would receive a stranger of such poor\r\npretensions. I had already learned at Florence that the fair sex are\r\ninvariably dazzled by titles and riches; and I had a curiosity to try\r\nwhether I should be at all sought after when apparently unpossessed of\r\nsuch qualifications. Not that I had any serious thoughts of matrimony;\r\nfor I was far from being so romantic as to suppose that any beautiful\r\nlady of high birth would fall in love with me so long as I passed for\r\nplain Signor Cornari. No; it was merely a whim of mine--would that I had\r\nnever undertaken to gratify it.\r\n\r\n\"I was altogether unattended by any retinue, having quitted Florence\r\nwith only a single valet, who died of sudden illness on the road. Thus\r\ndid I enter Naples alone, with my package of necessaries fastened to the\r\nsaddle of the steed that bore me. I put up at a small, but respectable\r\nhostel; and the first few days of my residence at the Neapolitan capital\r\nwere passed in making inquiries concerning the individual whose large\r\ndebt to my deceased father had been the principal cause of my journey\r\nthither.\r\n\r\n\"I found him, at length, but perceiving that he was totally unable to\r\nliquidate the claim upon him, I did not discover my real name, and took\r\nmy leave, resolving to think no more of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Returning to the inn, I happened to pass through one of the most\r\nsqualid and miserable parts of the city, when my attention was suddenly\r\nfixed upon the most charming female figure I had ever seen in my life.\r\nThe object of my interest was respectably but plainly clad; indeed, she\r\nappeared to belong to the class of petty tradespeople. Her form was most\r\nperfect in its symmetry; her gait was peculiarly graceful, and her\r\nmanners were evidently modest and reserved: for she looked neither to\r\nthe right nor to the left, but pursued her way with all the\r\nunobtrusiveness of strict propriety. I longed to behold her face; and,\r\nquickening my steps, presently passed her. I then had an opportunity of\r\nbeholding the most beautiful countenance that ever adorned a woman.\r\nHeaven seemed to smile through the mirror of her mild black eyes; and\r\nthere was such an indescribable sweetness in the general expression of\r\nher face, that it might have served a limner to copy for the countenance\r\nof an angel! She saw that I gazed intently upon her, and instantly\r\nturned aside into another street; for I should observe that females of\r\nthe lower orders in Naples are not permitted to wear veils.\r\n\r\n\"I stood looking after her until she was lost to my view; and then I\r\nwent slowly back to the inn, my mind full of the image of the beautiful\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\"Day after day did I rove through that same quarter of the city in the\r\nhope of meeting her again; and every evening did I return to my lonely\r\nchamber, chagrined and disappointed. My spirits sank, my appetite fled,\r\nand I grew restless and melancholy. At length I one morning beheld her\r\nin the flower-market, and I stood gazing on her with such enthusiastic,\r\nand yet such respectful admiration, that though she turned away, still\r\nmethought it was not with a feeling of resentment.\r\n\r\n\"I was transfixed to the spot for some minutes, and it was not until she\r\nhad disappeared amidst the crowd gathered in that quarter, that I could\r\nso collect my scattered thoughts as to curse my folly for having omitted\r\nsuch an opportunity of accosting her. I however inquired of an old woman\r\nof whom she had purchased some flowers, who she was; but all the\r\ninformation I could glean was, that she had recently been in the habit\r\nof buying a few flowers every Wednesday of that same old woman. I went\r\naway more contented than I had felt for many days, because I now felt\r\ncertain that I knew where to meet the lovely creature again.\r\nNevertheless, during the six succeeding days I rambled about the flower\r\nmarket and the squalid quarter of the city where I had first seen her,\r\nbut my search was unsuccessful; and the greater the disappointment I\r\nexperienced, the more powerful grew my love. Yes, it was indeed love\r\nwhich I now felt, for the first time, and for a being to whom I had\r\nnever spoken--whom I had only seen twice, and on these occasions only\r\nfor a few minutes, and whom I knew, by her garb, to belong to the poorer\r\nclass. But on the following Wednesday I saw her for the third time; and\r\nwhen she beheld me standing near the old woman's flower stall, she\r\nappeared vexed and surprised, and was about to turn away. I however\r\napproached her, besought her to accept of the choicest nosegay which I\r\nhad been able to find, and continued to speak to her in so ardent, yet\r\nrespectful a manner, that she no longer viewed me with resentment, but\r\nwith something approaching to interest. And if I had been charmed by her\r\nbeauty when as yet I had seen her at a comparative distance, how\r\nenraptured was I now by a nearer contemplation of that heavenly\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"I assured her that her image had never been absent from my heart since\r\nfirst I saw her, that I should never know peace or happiness again until\r\nshe would give me some hope, and that I would sooner die than have her\r\nconstrue my words into an insult. She was touched by the earnestness and\r\nevident sincerity of my manner; and, encouraged by her silence, I\r\nproceeded hastily to inform her that my name was Cornari, that I was a\r\nyoung man of humble birth, but that I possessed a modest competency, and\r\nwas my own master. I then pressed her to accept my nosegay; but,\r\nsuddenly bursting into tears, she exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"'O, signor, you know not whom you have thus honored with your notice,'\r\nand hurried away, leaving me absolutely stupefied with astonishment and\r\ngrief. It immediately struck me that she was a lost and degraded\r\ncreature, who dared not respond to a virtuous love. But a few moments'\r\nreflection told me that such innocence, such artlessness, such candor\r\nnever could be assumed--never feigned; no, they were most natural! And\r\nthis conviction, added to the intense curiosity which now inspired me to\r\nfathom the mystery of her singular remark, rendered me more anxious than\r\never to meet with her again. Several weeks passed without seeing the\r\ngratification of my wish; and I was becoming seriously ill with\r\ndisappointment and defeated hope, when accident led me to encounter her\r\nonce more. She would have avoided me, but I absolutely compelled her to\r\nstop. Seizing her hand, I said,--\r\n\r\n\"'Look at me--behold to what I am reduced--mark these pale and sunken\r\ncheeks, and have pity on me!'\r\n\r\n\"'And I, too,' she murmured, 'have been very miserable since we last\r\nmet.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then you have thought of me?' I exclaimed, retaining her hand still in\r\nmine, and reading love in the depths of her large dark eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'I have,' she answered bitterly, withdrawing her hand at the same time;\r\nthen in a tone of deep anguish she added, 'I implore you to let me\r\nproceed on my way; and if you value your own happiness you will never\r\nseek to see me more.'\r\n\r\n\"'But my happiness depends on seeing you often,' I exclaimed; 'and if\r\nthe offer of an honest heart be acceptable, I have that to give.'\r\n\r\n\"She shuddered dreadfully from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"'Surely you are not married already?' I said, rendered desperate by her\r\nstrange and incomprehensible manner.\r\n\r\n\"'I married!' she absolutely shrieked forth. Then perceiving that I was\r\nperfectly amazed and horrified by the wild vehemence of her\r\nejaculations, she said in a subdued, melancholy tone, 'I adjure you to\r\nthink of me no more.'\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, beauteous stranger,' I exclaimed; 'I love and adore you. My\r\nhappiness is at stake. Repeat that cruel adjuration, and you inflict a\r\ndeath-blow. If I be loathsome to your sight, tell me so; but leave me\r\nnot a prey to the most horrible suspense. If you have a father, I will\r\naccompany you to him and make honorable proposals.'\r\n\r\n\"'My father!' she murmured, while her countenance was suddenly swept by\r\na passing expression of anguish so intense that I began to tremble for\r\nher reason.\r\n\r\n\"I implored her to speak candidly and openly, and not in brief sentences\r\nof such ominous mystery. She scarcely appeared to listen to my words,\r\nbut seemed totally absorbed in the mental contemplation of a deeply\r\nseated woe. At length she suddenly turned her large dark eyes upon me,\r\nand said in a low, plaintive, profoundly touching tone:\r\n\r\n\"'Signor Cornari, again I adjure you to think of me no more. But for my\r\nown sake I would not have you believe that unmaidenly conduct on my part\r\nis the cause of the solemn prayer I thus make to you. No, no; I have\r\nnaught wherewith I can reproach myself; but there are reasons of\r\nterrible import that compel me to address you in this manner.\r\nNevertheless,' she added, more slowly and hesitatingly, 'if you really\r\nshould continue to entertain so deep an interest in me as to render you\r\ndesirous to hear the last explanation from my lips, then may you rely\r\nupon meeting me on this spot, and at the same hour, fifteen days hence.'\r\n\r\n\"She then hurried away. How that fortnight passed I can scarcely tell.\r\nTo me it appeared an age. I was deeply, madly enamored of that strange,\r\nbeautiful, and apparently conscientious being; and the mystery which\r\ninvolved her threw around her a halo of interest that fanned the flame\r\nof my passion. I was prepared to make any sacrifice rather than abandon\r\nall hope of calling her my own. The proud title of Riverola was as\r\nnothing in my estimation when weighed in the balance against her\r\ncharms--her bewitching manner--her soft, retiring modesty. I moreover\r\nflattered myself that I was not indifferent to her; and I loved her all\r\nthe more sincerely because I reflected that if she gave her heart to me,\r\nit would be to the poor and humble Cornari, and not to the rich and\r\nmighty Lord of Riverola.\r\n\r\n\"At length the day--the memorable day--came; and she failed not to keep\r\nher appointment. She was pale--very pale--but exquisitely beautiful; and\r\nshe smiled in spite of herself when she beheld me. She endeavored to\r\nconceal her emotions, but she could not altogether subdue the evidence\r\nof that gratification which my presence caused her.\r\n\r\n\"'You have disregarded my most earnest prayer,' she said, in a low and\r\nagitated tone.\r\n\r\n\"'My happiness depends upon you,' I answered; 'in the name of Heaven\r\nkeep me not in suspense; but tell me, can you and will you be mine?'\r\n\r\n\"'I could be thine, but I dare not,' she replied, in a voice scarcely\r\naudible.\r\n\r\n\"'Reveal to me the meaning of this strange contradiction, I implore\r\nyou!' said I, again a prey to the most torturing suspense. 'Do you love\r\nanother?'\r\n\r\n\"'Did I love another,' she exclaimed, withdrawing the hand which I had\r\ntaken, 'I should not be here this day.'\r\n\r\n\"'Pardon me,' I cried; 'I would not offend you for worlds! If you do not\r\nlove another, can you love me?'\r\n\r\n\"Again she allowed me to take her hand; and this concession, together\r\nwith the rapid but eloquent glance she threw upon me, was the answer to\r\nmy question.\r\n\r\n\"'Then, if you can love me,' I urged, 'why cannot you be mine?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because,' she replied, in that tone of bitterness which did me harm to\r\nhear it, 'you are born of parents whose name and whose calling you dare\r\nmention; whereas you would loathe me as much as you now declare that you\r\nlove me, were you to learn who my father is! For mother, alas! I have\r\nnone; she has been dead many years!' And tears streamed down her cheeks.\r\nI also wept, so deeply did I sympathize with her.\r\n\r\n\"'Beloved girl,' I exclaimed, 'you wrong me! What is it to me if your\r\nfather be the veriest wretch, the greatest criminal that crawls upon the\r\nface of the earth, so long as you are pure and innocent?'\"\r\n\r\n\"'No, no,' she cried hastily, 'you misunderstand me. There breathes not\r\na more upright man than my father.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then wherefore should I be ashamed to own my marriage with his\r\ndaughter?' I asked in an impassioned manner.\r\n\r\n\"'Because,' she said, in a tone of such intense anguish that it rent my\r\nheart as she began to speak; 'because,' she repeated slowly and\r\nemphatically, 'he is viewed with abhorrence by that world which is so\r\nunjust; for that which constitutes the stigma is hereditary office in\r\nhis family--an office that he dares not vacate under pain of death; and\r\nnow you can too well comprehend that my sire is the PUBLIC EXECUTIONER\r\nOF NAPLES!'\r\n\r\n\"This announcement came upon me like a thunderbolt. I turned sick at\r\nheart--my eyes grew dim--my brain whirled--I staggered and should have\r\nfallen had I not come in contact with a wall. It appeared to me\r\nafterward that sobs of ineffable agony fell upon my ears, while I was\r\nyet in a state of semi-stupefaction--and methought likewise that a\r\ndelicate, soft hand pressed mine convulsively for a moment. Certain it\r\nwas, that when I recovered my presence of mind, when I was enabled to\r\ncollect my scattered thoughts, the executioner's daughter was no longer\r\nnear me. I was in despair at the revelation which had been\r\nmade--overwhelmed with grief, too, at having suffered her thus to\r\ndepart--for I feared that I should never see her more. Before me was my\r\nhopeless love, behind me, like an evil dream, was the astounding\r\nannouncement which still rang in my ears, though breathed in such soft\r\nand plaintive tones! Three or four minutes were wasted in the struggles\r\nof conflicting thoughts, ere I was sufficiently master of myself to\r\nremember that I might still overtake the maiden who had fled from me. It\r\nstruck me that her father's dwelling must be near the criminal prison;\r\nand this was in the squalid quarter of the town where I had first\r\nencountered her. Thither I sped--into the dark streets, so perilous\r\nafter dusk, I plunged; and at length I overtook the object of my\r\naffection, just as she was skirting the very wall of the prison. I\r\nseized her by the hand and implored her to forgive me for the manner in\r\nwhich I had received the last explanation to which I had urged her.\r\n\r\n\"'It was natural that you should shrink in loathing from the bare idea,'\r\nshe said, in a tone which rent my heart. 'And now leave me, signor; for\r\nfurther conversation between us is useless.'\r\n\r\n\"'No,' I exclaimed; 'I will not leave you until I shall have exacted\r\nfrom you a promise that you will be mine, and only mine! For I could not\r\nlive without you; and most unjust should I be, most unworthy of the name\r\nof a man, if I were to allow a contemptible prejudice to stand in the\r\nway of my happiness.'\r\n\r\n\"She returned no answer, but the rapidity of her breathing and the ill\r\nsubdued sobs which interrupted her respiration at short intervals,\r\nconvinced me that a fierce struggle was taking place within her bosom.\r\nFor it was now quite dark and I could not see her face; the hand,\r\nhowever, which I held clasped in my own, trembled violently.\r\n\r\n\"'Beautiful maiden,' I said after a long pause, 'wherefore do you not\r\nreply to me? Were I the proudest peer in Christendom, I would sacrifice\r\nevery consideration of rank and family for your sake. What more can man\r\nsay? What more can he do?'\r\n\r\n\"'Signor Cornari,' she answered at length, 'prudence tells me to fly\r\nfrom you; but my heart prompts me to remain. Alas! I feel that the\r\nlatter feeling is dominant within me!'\r\n\r\n\"'And you will be mine?' I demanded eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"'Thine forever!' she murmured, her head sinking upon my breast.\r\n\r\n\"But I shall not dwell unnecessarily on this portion of my narrative.\r\nSuffice it to say we parted, having arranged another meeting for the\r\nnext evening. It was on this occasion that I said to her:\r\n\r\n\"'Vitangela, I have thought profoundly on all that passed between us\r\nyesterday; and I am more than ever determined to make you my wife. Let\r\nus away to your father, and demand his consent to our union.'\r\n\r\n\"'Stay,' she said, in an emphatic tone, 'and hear me patiently ere you\r\neither renew the promise to wed me, or reiterate your desire to seek my\r\nfather. You must know,' she continued, while I listened with painful\r\nsuspense, 'that my father will not oppose a step in which his daughter's\r\nhappiness is involved. But the very moment that sees our hands joined,\r\nwill behold the registry of the marriage in the book kept by the\r\nlieutenant of police; and thereby will be constituted a record of the\r\nname of one who, if need be, must assume the functions of that office\r\nwhich my sire now fills.'\r\n\r\n\"'What mean you, Vitangela?' I demanded, horrified by the dim yet\r\nominous significance of these horrible words.\r\n\r\n\"'I mean,' she continued, 'that the terrible post of public executioner\r\nmust remain in our family while it exists; and those who form marriages\r\nwith us, are considered to enter into our family. When my father dies,\r\nmy brother will succeed him, but should my brother die without leaving\r\nissue, or having a son to take his place, you, signor, if you become my\r\nhusband, will be forced to assume the terrible office.'\r\n\r\n\"'But I am not a Neapolitan,' I exclaimed; 'and I should hope that when\r\nwe are united, you will not insist upon dwelling in Naples.'\r\n\r\n\"'I would give worlds to leave this odious city,' she said,\r\nemphatically.\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing detains me here another day, nor another hour,' I cried; 'let\r\nthe priest unite our hands, and we forthwith set off for Florence. But\r\nwhy should not our marriage take place privately, unknown even to your\r\nfather? and in that case no entry could be made in the books of the\r\nlieutenant of police.'\r\n\r\n\"'You have expressed that desire which I myself feared to utter, lest\r\nyou should think it unmaidenly,' she murmured. 'For your sake I will\r\nquit home and kindred without further hesitation.'\r\n\r\n\"I was rejoiced at this proof of affection and confidence on her part;\r\nand it was arranged between us that we should be married on the ensuing\r\nevening, and in the most private way possible.\r\n\r\n\"Before we parted, however, I drew from her a solemn pledge that, when\r\nonce she had become my wife, she would never even allude to her\r\nfamily--that she would not communicate to them the name of her husband\r\nnor the place of our abode, under any circumstance--in a word, that she\r\nwould consider her father and brother as dead to her,--and she to them.\r\n\r\n\"With streaming eyes and sobbing heart she gave the sacred promise I\r\nrequired, ratifying it with an oath which I made her repeat to my\r\ndictation.\r\n\r\n\"On the ensuing evening Vitangela met me according to appointment, and\r\nit was then I revealed to her my real name and rank.\r\n\r\n\"'Dearest girl,' I said, 'you gave me your heart, believing me to be a\r\npoor and humble individual; and you have consented to become my wife and\r\nabandon home and kindred for my sake. Profoundly then do I rejoice that\r\nit is in my power to elevate you to a position of which your beauty,\r\nyour amiability and your virtue render you so eminently worthy; and in\r\nmy own native Florence, no lady will be more courted, nor treated with\r\ngreater distinction than the Countess of Riverola.'\r\n\r\n\"She uttered an exclamation of sorrow and would have fallen to the\r\nground if I had not supported her.\r\n\r\n\"'Oh!' she murmured, 'I would have been happier were you indeed the\r\nhumble Signor Cornari!'\r\n\r\n\"'No; think not thus,' I urged, 'wealth and rank are two powerful aids\r\nto happiness in this life. But at all events; my beloved Vitangela, you\r\nnow recognize more than ever the paramount necessity which induces you\r\nto maintain inviolate your solemn vow of yesterday.'\r\n\r\n\"'I require no such inducement to compel me to keep that pledge,' she\r\nanswered. 'Think you that I would bring disgrace on the name, whether\r\nhumble or lofty, with which you have proposed to honor me? Oh!\r\nno--never, never!\"\r\n\r\n\"I embraced her fondly; and we proceeded to the dwelling of a priest, by\r\nwhom our hands were united in the oratory attached to his abode. At\r\ndaybreak we quitted Naples, and in due time we reached Florence, where\r\nmy bride was received with enthusiastic welcome by all the friends of\r\nthe Riverola family. My happiness appeared to have been established on a\r\nsolid foundation by this alliance; and the birth of Nisida in 1495--just\r\none year after the marriage--was a bond which seemed to unite our hearts\r\nthe more closely if possible. Indeed, I can safely assert that not a\r\nharsh word ever passed between us, nor did aught occur to mar our\r\ncomplete felicity for years after our union. In 1500, however, a\r\ncircumstance took place which proved to be the first link in the chain\r\nof incidents destined to wield a dire influence over my happiness. It\r\nwas in the month of April of that year--oh! how indelibly is the\r\ndetested date fixed on my memory--the Duke Piero de Medici gave a grand\r\nentertainment to all the aristocracy of Florence. The banquet was of the\r\nmost excellent description; and the gardens of the palace were\r\nbrilliantly illuminated. The days of Lorenzo the Magnificent seemed to\r\nhave been revived for a short period by his degenerate descendant. All\r\nthe beauty and rank of the republic were assembled at this festival; but\r\nno lady was more admired for the chaste elegance of her attire, the\r\nmodest dignity of her deportment, and the loveliness of her person, than\r\nVitangela, Countess of Riverola. After the banquet the company proceeded\r\nto the gardens, where bands of music were stationed, and while some\r\nindulged in the exhilarating dance, others sauntered through the\r\nbrilliantly lighted avenues. I need not inform you that no husband,\r\nunless he were anxious to draw down upon himself the ridicule which\r\nattaches itself to extreme uxoriousness, would remain linked to his\r\nwife's side all the evening at such an entertainment as the one of which\r\nI am speaking. I was therefore separated from the countess, whom I left\r\nin an arbor with some other ladies, and I joined the group which had\r\nassembled around the prince. I know not exactly how it was I happened to\r\nquit my companions, after a lively conversation which had probably\r\nlasted about an hour; certain, however, it is that before midnight I was\r\nproceeding alone down a long avenue in which utter darkness reigned, but\r\noutside of which the illuminations shone brilliantly.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly I heard voices near me; and one of them appeared to be that of\r\nthe Countess of Riverola--but they were speaking in so subdued a tone\r\nthat I was by no means confident in my suspicion. The voices approached;\r\nand a sentiment of curiosity, unaccountable at the time, as I believed\r\nVitangela to be purity itself, impelled me to listen more attentively.\r\nTo conceal myself was not necessary; I had to remain perfectly still for\r\nmy presence to be unknown, utter darkness prevailing in the avenue. The\r\npersons who were conversing advanced.\r\n\r\n\"'You know,' said the soft and whispering voice which I believed to be\r\nthat of my wife, 'you know how sincerely, how tenderly I love you, and\r\nwhat a frightful risk I run in according you thus a few moments' private\r\ndiscourse!'\r\n\r\n\"The voice of a man made some reply, the words of which did not reach my\r\nears; then the pair stopped and I heard the billing sound of kisses. O! how\r\nmy blood boiled in my veins! I grasped the handle of my sword--but I was\r\nnailed to the spot--my state of mind was such that though I longed--I\r\nthirsted for vengeance--yet was I powerless--motionless--paralyzed. To\r\nthe sound of kisses succeeded those of sobbing and of grief on the part\r\nof the lady whose voice had produced such a terrible effect upon me.\r\n\r\n\"'Holy Virgin!' I thought, 'she deplores the fate that chains her to her\r\nhusband! she weeps because she has not courage to fly with her lover!'\r\nand now I experienced just the same sensations as those which stunned\r\nand stupefied me on that evening at Naples when I first heard that\r\nVitangela was the child of the public executioner. Several minutes must\r\nhave passed while I was in this condition of comparative insensibility;\r\nor rather while I was a prey to the stunning conviction that I was\r\ndeceived by her whom I had loved so well and deemed so pure. When I\r\nawoke from that dread stupor all was still in the dark avenue; not a\r\nfootstep, not a whispering voice was heard. I hurried along amidst the\r\ntrees, my soul racked with the cruelest suspicions. And yet I was not\r\nconfident that it was positively my wife's voice that I had heard; and\r\nthe more I pondered on the circumstance, the more anxious was I to\r\narrive at the conviction that I had indeed been deceived by some voice\r\nclosely resembling hers. I accordingly hurried back to the arbor where I\r\nhad last seen her in the company of several Florentine ladies. Joy\r\nanimated my soul when I beheld Vitangela seated in that arbor, and in\r\nthe very spot, too, where I had beheld her upward of an hour previously.\r\nBut she was now alone.\r\n\r\n\"'Where are your friends?' I asked, in a kind tone, as I approached and\r\ngently took her hand.\r\n\r\n\"'Indeed I know not,' she replied, casting a hurried glance around, and\r\nnow appearing surprised to find that there was not another lady near\r\nher. She seemed confused; and I also observed that she had been weeping\r\nvery recently. The joy which had for a moment animated me, was now\r\nsucceeded by a sudden chill that went to my heart death-like--icy. But,\r\nsubduing my emotion, I said:\r\n\r\n\"'Your ladyship has not surely remained here ever since I last saw you,\r\nmore than an hour ago?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes,' she responded, without daring to raise her eyes to meet mine. I\r\nknew that she lied, most foully lied: her confusion, her whole manner\r\nbetrayed her. But I exercised a powerful mastery over my mind; the\r\nsuspicion which I had all along entertained was strengthened greatly,\r\nbut not altogether confirmed; and I resolved to wait for confirmation\r\nere I allowed my vengeance to burst forth. Moreover, it was necessary to\r\ndiscover who the gallant might be--the favored one who had superseded me\r\nin the affections of Vitangela! I, however, promised myself that when\r\nonce my information was complete, my revenge should be terrible; and\r\nthis resolution served as a solace for the moment, and as an inducement\r\nfor me to conceal alike the suspicions I had imbibed and the dreadful\r\npain they had caused me.\r\n\r\n\"Presenting my hand, therefore, to Vitangela, I escorted her to that\r\npart of the ground where the company were now assembled, and where I\r\nhoped that some accident might make known to me the person of the\r\ngallant with whom, as I supposed, she had walked in the avenue.\r\nAnxiously, but unsuspected, did I watch the manner of the countess every\r\ntime she returned the salutation of the various nobles and cavaliers\r\nwhom we encountered in our walk; but not a blush, not a sign of\r\nconfusion on her part, not one rapidly dealt, but significant glance,\r\nafforded me the clew I so ardently sought. And yet it struck me that she\r\noften cast furtive and uneasy, or rather searching looks hither and\r\nthither, as if to seek and single out some one individual in the\r\nmultitudes moving about the illuminated gardens. She was certainly\r\npre-occupied, and even mournful, but I affected not to observe that a\r\ncloud hung over her spirits, and in order to throw her completely off\r\nher guard, I talked and laughed quite as gayly as was my wont. To be\r\nbrief, the festivities terminated a little before sunrise, and I\r\nconducted the countess back to our mansion. From that night forth I\r\nmaintained the strictest watch upon her conduct and proceedings. I\r\nappointed Margaretha, the mother of my page Antonio, to act the spy upon\r\nher; but weeks and months passed, and nothing occurred to confirm the\r\nterrible suspicion that haunted me night and day. I strove to banish\r\nthat suspicion from my mind--Heaven knows how hard I tried to crush it.\r\nBut it was immortal--and it beset me as if it were the ghost of some\r\nvictim I had ruthlessly murdered. Vitangela saw that my manner had\r\nsomewhat changed toward her, and she frequently questioned me on the\r\nsubject. I, however, gave her evasive answers, for I should have been\r\nashamed to acknowledge my suspicion if it were false, and it was only by\r\nkeeping her off her guard I should receive confirmation if it were true.\r\nThus nearly nine months passed away from the date of the ducal banquet,\r\nand then you, Francisco, were born. The presence of an heir to my name\r\nand wealth was a subject of much congratulation on the part of my\r\nfriends; but to me it was a source of torturing doubts and racking\r\nfears. You never bore the least--no, not the least resemblance, either\r\nphysical or mental, to me; whereas the very reverse was the case with\r\nNisida, even in her infancy. From the moment of your birth--from the\r\nfirst instant that I beheld you in the nurse's arms--the most agonizing\r\nfeelings took possession of my soul. Were you indeed my son?--or were\r\nyou the pledge of adulterous love? Merciful heavens! in remembering all\r\nI suffered when the terrible thoughts oppressed me, I wonder that you,\r\nFrancisco, should now be alive--that I did not strangle you as you lay\r\nin your cradle. And, oh God! how dearly I could have loved you,\r\nFrancisco, had I felt the same confidence in your paternity as in that\r\nof your sister Nisida! But no--all was at least doubt and uncertainty in\r\nthat respect--and, as your cast of features and physical characteristics\r\ndeveloped themselves, that hideous doubt and that racking uncertainty\r\nincreased until there were times when I was nearly goaded to do some\r\ndesperate deed. Those mild blue eyes--that rich brown hair--that\r\nfeminine softness of expression which marked your face belonged not to\r\nthe family of Riverola!\r\n\r\n\"Time wore on, and my unhappiness increased. I suspected my wife, yet\r\ndared not proclaim the suspicion. I sought to give her back my love, but\r\nwas utterly unable to subdue the dark thoughts and crush the maddening\r\nuncertainties that agitated my soul. At last I was sinking into a state\r\nof morbid melancholy, when an incident occurred which revived all the\r\nenergies of my mind. It was in 1505--Nisida being then ten years old,\r\nand you, Francisco, four--when Margaretha informed me one evening that\r\nthe countess had received a letter which had thrown her into a state of\r\nconsiderable agitation, and which she had immediately burned. By\r\nquestioning the porter at the gate of the mansion, I learnt that the\r\nperson who delivered the letter was a tall, handsome man of about\r\nthirty-two, with brown hair, blue eyes, and a somewhat feminine\r\nexpression of countenance. Holy Virgin! this must be the gallant--the\r\nparamour of my wife--the father of the boy on whom the law compelled me\r\nto bestow my own name. Such were the ideas that immediately struck me;\r\nand I now prepared for vengeance. Margaretha watched my wife narrowly,\r\nand on the evening following the one on which the letter had been\r\ndelivered, Vitangela was seen to secure a heavy bag of gold about her\r\nperson, and quit the mansion by the secret staircase of her\r\napartment--that apartment which is now the sleeping-place of your sister\r\nNisida.\r\n\r\n\"Margaretha followed the countess to an obscure street, at the corner of\r\nwhich the guilty woman encountered a tall person, enveloped in a cloak,\r\nand who was evidently waiting for her. To him she gave the bag of gold,\r\nand they embraced each other tenderly. Then they separated--the countess\r\nreturning home, unconscious that a spy watched her movements. Margaretha\r\nreported all that had occurred to me; and I bade her redouble her\r\nattention in watching her mistress. Now that the lover is once more in\r\nthis city, I thought, and well provided with my gold to pursue his\r\nextravagance, there will soon be another meeting--and then for vengeance\r\nsuch as an Italian must have. But weeks and months again passed without\r\naffording the opportunity which I craved; yet I knew that the day must\r\ncome--and I could tutor myself to await its arrival, if not with\r\npatience, at least with so much outward composure as to lull the\r\ncountess into belief of perfect security.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, weeks and months passed away, ay, and years, too, and still I\r\nnursed my hopes and projects of vengeance, the craving for which\r\nincreased with the lapse of time.\r\n\r\n\"And now I come to the grand, the terrible, the main incident in this\r\nnarrative. It was late one night, in the month of January, 1510, Nisida\r\nbeing then fifteen and thou, Francisco, nine, that Margaretha came to me\r\nin my own apartment and informed me that she had seen the tall gallant\r\ntraverse the garden hastily and obtain admission into the countess'\r\nchamber by means of the secret staircase. The hour for vengeance had at\r\nlength come. Margaretha was instantly dispatched to advise two bravoes\r\nwhose services I had long secured for the occasion, that the moment had\r\narrived when they were to do the work for which they had been so well\r\npaid in advance, and by the faithful performance of which they would\r\nstill further enrich themselves. Within half an hour all the\r\narrangements were completed. Margaretha had retired to her own chamber\r\nand the bravoes were concealed with me in the garden. Nor had we long to\r\nwait. The private door opened shortly, and two persons appeared on the\r\nthreshold. The night was clear and beautiful, and from my hiding-place I\r\ncould discern the fondness of the embrace that marked their parting. And\r\nthey parted, too, never to meet again in this life!\r\n\r\n\"Vitangela closed the door--and her lover was passing rapidly along\r\namidst the trees in the garden, when a dagger suddenly drank his heart's\r\nblood. That dagger was mine, and wielded by my hand! He fell without a\r\ngroan--dead, stone-dead at my feet. Half of my vengeance was now\r\naccomplished; the other half was yet to be consummated. Without a\r\nmoment's unnecessary delay the corpse was conveyed to a cellar beneath\r\nthe northern wing of the mansion: and the two bravoes then hastened, to\r\nVitangela's chamber, into which they obtained admission by forcing the\r\ndoor of the private staircase. In pursuance of the orders which they had\r\nreceived from me, they bound and gagged her, and conveyed her through\r\nthe garden to the very cellar where, by the light of a gloomy lamp, she\r\nbeheld her husband standing close by a corpse!\r\n\r\n\"'Bring her near!' I exclaimed, unmoved by the looks of indescribable\r\nhorror which she threw around.\r\n\r\n\"When her eyes caught sight of the countenance of that lifeless being,\r\nthey remained fixed with frenzied wildness in their sockets, and even if\r\nthere had been no gag between her teeth, I do not believe that she could\r\nhave uttered a syllable. And now commenced the second act in this\r\nappalling tragedy! While one of the bravoes held the countess in his\r\niron grasp, in such a manner that she could not avert her head, the\r\nother, who had once been a surgeon, tore away the garments from the\r\ncorpse, and commenced the task which I had before assigned to him. And\r\nas the merciless scalpel hacked and hewed away at the still almost\r\npalpitating flesh of the murdered man, in whose breast the dagger\r\nremained deeply buried,--a ferocious joy--a savage, hyena-like triumph\r\nfilled my soul; and I experienced no remorse for the deed I had done!\r\nFar--very far from that--for as the work progressed, I exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"'Behold, Vitangela, how the scalpel hews that form so loved by thee!\r\nNow hack away at the countenance--deface that beauty--pick out those\r\nmild blue eyes!'--and I laughed madly!\r\n\r\n\"The countess fainted, and I ordered her to be carried back to her\r\napartment, where Margaretha awaited her. Indeed I had naturally foreseen\r\nthat insensibility would result from the appalling spectacle which I\r\ncompelled my wife to witness: and Margaretha was prepared to breathe\r\ndreadful menaces in her ears the moment she should recover--menaces of\r\ndeath to herself and both her children if she should reveal, even to her\r\nfather confessor, one tittle of the scene which that night had been\r\nenacted! The surgeon-bravo did his work bravely; and the man who had\r\ndishonored me was reduced to naught save a skeleton! The flesh and the\r\ngarments were buried deep in the cellar; the skeleton was conveyed to my\r\nown chamber, and suspended to a beam in the closet where you, Francisco,\r\nand your bride, are destined to behold it--ALONG WITH ANOTHER!\r\n\r\n\"My vengeance was thus far gratified--the bravos were dismissed, and I\r\nlocked myself up in my chamber for several days, to brood upon all I had\r\ndone, and occasionally to feast my eyes with the grim remains of him who\r\nhad dared to love my wife. During those days of seclusion I would see no\r\none save the servant who brought me my meals. From him I learnt that the\r\ncountess was dangerously ill--that she was indeed dying, and that she\r\nbesought me to visit her if only for a moment. But I refused--implacably\r\nrefused. I was convinced that she craved my forgiveness; and that I\r\ncould not give.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Duras, who attended upon her, came to the door of my chamber and\r\nimplored me to grant him an interview:--then Nisida sought a similar\r\nboon; but I was deaf to each and all.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--for there was still a being on whom I yet longed to wreak my\r\nvengeance;--and that being was yourself, Francisco? I looked upon you as\r\nthe living evidence of my dishonor--the memorial of your mother's\r\nboundless guilt. But I recoiled in horror from the idea of staining my\r\nhands with the blood of a little child--yet I feared if I came near\r\nyou--if I saw your clinging affectionately to Vitangela--if I heard you\r\ninnocently and unconsciously mock me by calling me 'father!'--I felt I\r\nshould be unable to restrain the fury of my wrath!\r\n\r\n\"I know not how long I should have remained in the seclusion of my own\r\nchamber--perhaps weeks and months, but one morning shortly after\r\ndaybreak, I was informed by the only servant whom I would admit near me,\r\nthat the countess had breathed her last during the night, and that\r\nNisida was so deeply affected by her mother's death, that she, poor\r\ngirl, was dangerously ill. Then I became frantic on account of my\r\ndaughter; and I quitted my apartment, not only to see that proper aid\r\nwas administered to her, but to complete the scheme of vengeance which I\r\nhad originally formed. Thus, in the first place, Dr. Duras was enjoined\r\nto take up his abode altogether in the Riverola Palace, so long as\r\nNisida should require his services; and, on the other hand, a splendid\r\nfuneral was ordered for the Countess Riverola. But Vitangela's remains\r\nwent not in the velvet-covered coffin to the family vault;--no--her\r\nflesh was buried in the same soil where rotted the flesh of her\r\nparamour--and her skeleton was suspended from the same beam to which his\r\nbones had been already hung. For I thought within myself: 'This is the\r\nfirst time that the wife of a Count of Riverola has ever brought\r\ndishonor and disgrace upon her husband; and I will take care that it\r\nshall be the last. To Nisida will I leave all my estates--all my wealth,\r\nsave a miserable pittance as an inheritance for the bastard Francisco.\r\nShe shall inherit the title, and the man on whom she may confer her hand\r\nshall be the next Count of Riverola. The wedding-day will be marked by a\r\nrevelation of the mystery of this cabinet; and the awful spectacle will\r\nteach him, whoever he may be, to watch his wife narrowly--and will teach\r\n_her_ what it is to prove unfaithful to a fond husband! To both, the\r\nlesson will be as useful as the manner of conveying it will be\r\nfrightful, and they will hand down the tradition to future scions of the\r\nRiverola family. Francisco, too, shall learn the secrets of the cabinet;\r\nhe shall be taught why he is disinherited--why I have hated him: and\r\nthus even from the other world shall the spirits of the vile paramour\r\nand the adulterous wife behold the consequences of their crime\r\nperpetuated in this.'\r\n\r\n\"Such were my thoughts--such were my intentions. But an appalling\r\ncalamity forced me to change my views. Nisida, after a long and painful\r\nillness, became deaf and dumb; and Dr. Duras gave me no hope of the\r\nrestoration of her lost faculties.\r\n\r\n\"Terrible visitation! Then was it that I reasoned with myself--that I\r\ndeliberated long and earnestly upon the course which I should pursue. It\r\nwas improbable that, afflicted as Nisida was, she would ever marry; and\r\nI felt grieved, deeply grieved, to think that you, Francisco, being\r\ndisinherited, and Nisida remaining single, the proud title of Riverola\r\nwould become extinct; I therefore resolved on the less painful\r\nalternative of disinheriting you altogether; and I accordingly made a\r\nwill by which I left you the estates, with the contingent title Count of\r\nRiverola, under certain conditions which might yet alienate both\r\nproperty and rank from you, and endow therewith your sister Nisida. For\r\nshould she recover the faculties of speech and hearing by the time she\r\nshall have attained the age of thirty-six, she will yet be marriageable\r\nand may have issue; but should that era in her life pass, and she still\r\nbe deaf and dumb, all hope of her recovery will be dead!\r\n\r\n\"Thus if she still be so deeply afflicted at that age, you, Francisco,\r\nwill inherit the vast estates and the lordly title which, through the\r\ncircumstances of your birth, it grieves me to believe will ever devolve\r\nupon you.\r\n\r\n\"Such were my motives for making that will which you are destined to\r\nhear read, doubtless before the time comes for you to peruse this\r\nmanuscript. And having made that will, and experiencing the sad\r\ncertainty that my unfortunate daughter will never become qualified to\r\ninherit my title and fortune, but that the name of Riverola must be\r\nperpetuated through your marriage, I have determined that to you and to\r\nyour bride alone shall the dread secrets of the cabinet be revealed.\"\r\n\r\nThus terminated the manuscript.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPowerful in meaning and strong in expression as the English language may\r\nbe rendered by one who has the least experience in the proper\r\ncombination of words, yet it becomes totally inadequate to the task of\r\nconveying an idea of those feelings--those harrowing emotions--those\r\nhorrifying sentiments, which were excited in the breasts of Francisco di\r\nRiverola and the beautiful Flora by the revolution of the manuscript. At\r\nfirst the document begat a deep and mournful interest, as it related the\r\ninterviews of the late count with Vitangela in the streets of Naples;\r\nthen amazement was engendered by the announcement of that lovely and\r\nunhappy being's ignominious parentage--but a calmness was diffused\r\nthrough the minds of Flora and Francisco, as if they had found a resting\r\nplace amidst the exciting incidents of the narrative when they reached\r\nthat part which mentioned the marriage.\r\n\r\nTheir feelings were, however, destined to be speedily and most painfully\r\nwrung once more; and Francisco could scarcely restrain his\r\nindignation--yes, his indignation even against the memory of his\r\ndeceased father--when he perused those injurious suspicions which were\r\nrecorded in reference to the honor of his mother. Though unable to\r\nexplain the mystery in which all that part of the narrative was\r\ninvolved, yet he felt firmly convinced that his mother was innocent; and\r\nhe frequently interrupted himself in the perusal of the manuscript to\r\ngive utterance to passionate ejaculations expressive of that opinion.\r\nBut it was when the hideous tragedy rapidly developed itself, and the\r\nhistory of the presence of two skeletons in the closet was detailed, it\r\nwas then that language became powerless to describe the mingled wrath\r\nand disgust which Francisco felt, or to delineate the emotions of\r\nboundless horror and wild amazement that were excited in the bosom of\r\nFlora. In spasmodic shuddering did the young countess cling to her\r\nhusband when she had learned how fearfully accurate was the manner in\r\nwhich the few lines of the manuscript which she had read many months\r\npreviously in Nisida's boudoir, fitted in the text, and how appalling\r\nwas the tale which the entire made. She was cruelly shocked, and her\r\nheart bled for that fine young man whom she was so proud to call her\r\nhusband, but whom his late father had loathed to recognize as a son. And\r\nNisida--what were her feelings as she lay stretched upon a couch,\r\nlistening to the contents of the manuscript which she had read before?\r\nAt first one hope--one idea was dominant in her soul, the hope that\r\nFlora would be crushed even to death by revelations which were indeed\r\nalmost sufficient to overwhelm a gentle disposition and freeze the vital\r\ncurrent in the tender and compassionate heart.\r\n\r\nBut as Francisco read on, and when he came to those passages which\r\ndescribed the sufferings and the cruel fate of her mother, then Nisida\r\nbecame a prey to the most torturing feelings--dreadful emotions were\r\nexpressed by her convulsed countenance and wildly-glaring eyes--and she\r\nmuttered deep and bitter anathemas against the memory of her own father.\r\nFor well does the reader know that she had loved her mother to\r\ndistraction; and thus the horrifying detail of the injuries heaped upon\r\nthe head and on the name of that revered parent aroused all her fiercest\r\npassions of rage and hate as completely as if that history had been new\r\nto her, and as if she were now becoming acquainted with it for the first\r\ntime. Indeed, so powerful, so terrible, was the effect produced by the\r\nrevival of all those dread reminiscences and heart-rending emotions on\r\nthe part of Nisida that, forgetting her malignant spite and her infernal\r\nhope with regard to Flora, she threw her whole soul into the subject of\r\nthe manuscript: and the torrent of feelings to which she thus gave way\r\nwas crushing and overwhelming to a woman of such fierce passions, and\r\nwho had received so awful a shock as that which had stretched her on the\r\ncouch where she now lay. For the fate of him whom she had loved with\r\nsuch ardor, and the revulsion that her affection experienced on account\r\nof the ghastly spectacle which Wagner presented to her view in his dying\r\nmoments--the disgust and loathing which had been inspired in her mind by\r\nthe thought that she had ever fondled that being in her arms and\r\nabsolutely doted on the superhuman beauty that had changed to such\r\nrevolting ugliness, it was all this that had struck her down--paralyzed\r\nher--inflicted a mortal, though not an instantaneous blow upon that\r\nwoman so lately full of energy, so strong in moral courage, and so full\r\nof vigorous health. Thus impressed with the conviction that her end was\r\napproaching, the moment the perusal of the manuscript was concluded the\r\nLady Nisida said, in a faint and dying tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\"Francisco, draw near--as near as possible--and listen to what I have\r\nnow to communicate, for it is in my power to clear up all doubt, all\r\nmystery relative to the honor of our sainted mother, and convince thee\r\nthat no stigma, no disgrace attaches itself to thy birth!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my beloved sister,\" exclaimed the young count, \"you speak in a\r\nfaint voice, you are very ill! In the name of the Holy Virgin! I conjure\r\nyou to allow me to send for Dr. Duras!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Francisco,\" said Nisida, her voice recovering somewhat of its power\r\nas she continued to address him: \"I implore you to let me have my own\r\nway, to follow my own inclinations! Do not thwart me, Francisco; already\r\nI feel as if molten lead were pouring through my brain, and a tremendous\r\nweight lies upon my heart! Forbear, then, from irritating me, my\r\nwell-beloved Francisco----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Nisida,\" cried the young count, throwing his arms around his\r\nsister's neck and embracing her fondly; \"if you love me now, if you ever\r\nloved me, grant me one boon! By the memory of our sainted mother I\r\nimplore you, by your affection for her I adjure you, Nisida----\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak, speak, Francisco,\" interrupted his sister, hastily: \"I can\r\nalmost divine the nature of the boon you crave--and--my God!\" she added,\r\ntears starting from her eyes, as a painful thought flashed across her\r\nbrain,--\"perhaps I have been too harsh--too severe! At all events, it is\r\nnot now--on my death-bed--that I can nurse resentment----\"\r\n\r\n\"Your death-bed!\" echoed Francisco, in a tone or acute anguish, while\r\nthe sobs which convulsed the bosom of the young countess were heard\r\nalike by him and his sister.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dearest brother, I am dying,\" said Nisida, in a voice of profound\r\nand mournful conviction; \"and therefore let me not delay those duties\r\nand those explanations which can alone unburden my heart of the weight\r\nthat lies upon it! And first, Francisco, be thy boon granted--for I know\r\nthat thou wouldst speak to me of her who is now thy bride. Come to my\r\narms, then. Flora, embrace me as a sister, and forgive me if thou canst,\r\nfor I have been a fierce and unrelenting enemy to thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let the past be forgotten, my friend, my sister!\" exclaimed the\r\nweeping Flora, as she threw herself into Nisida's outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nAnd the young wife and the young woman embraced each other tenderly--for\r\ndeep regrets and pungent remorse at last attuned the mind of Nisida to\r\nsweet and holy sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Nisida, \"sit down by my side, and listen to the\r\nexplanations which I have promised. Give me your hand. Flora, dear\r\nFlora, let me retain it in mine; for at the last hour, and when I am\r\nabout to leave this fair and beauteous earth, I feel an ardent longing\r\nto love those who walk upon its face, and to be loved by them in return.\r\nBut, alas, alas!\" she added, somewhat bitterly, \"reflections and\r\nyearnings of this nature come too late! O Flora! the picture of life is\r\nspread before you--while from me it is rapidly receding, and dissolving\r\ninto the past. Like our own fair city of palaces and flowers, when seen\r\nfrom a distance beneath the glorious lights of the morning, may that\r\nglorious picture continue to appear to thee; and may'st thou never draw\r\nnear enough to recognize the false splendors in which gorgeous hues may\r\ndeck the things of this world; may'st thou never be brought so close to\r\nthe sad realities of existence as to be forced to contemplate the\r\nbreaking hearts that dwell in palaces, or to view in disgust the slime\r\nupon flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nisida,\" said Francisco, bending over his sister, and speaking in a\r\nvoice indicative of deep emotion, \"the kind words you utter to my\r\nbeloved Flora shall ever--ever remain engraven upon my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on mine also,\" murmured the young countess, pressing Nisida's hand\r\nwith grateful ardor, while her eyes, radiant with very softness, threw a\r\nglance of passionate tenderness upon her generous-hearted and handsome\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me,\" resumed Nisida, after a short pause, during which she\r\ngave way to all the luxury of those sweet and holy reflections which the\r\npresent scene engendered: and these were the happiest moments of the\r\nlady's stormy life. \"Listen to me,\" she repeated; \"and let me enter upon\r\nand make an end of my explanations as speedily as possible. And first,\r\nFrancisco, relative to our sainted--our innocent--our deeply-wronged and\r\nmuch-injured mother. You have already learned that she was the daughter\r\nof the public executioner of Naples; and you have heard that ere she\r\nbecame our father's wife she swore a solemn oath--she pledged herself in\r\nthe most solemn manner that she would never even allude to her\r\nfamily--that she would not communicate to them the name of her husband\r\nnor the place of his abode, under any circumstances--in a word, that she\r\nwould consider her father and brother as dead to her! And yet she had a\r\ntender heart; and after she became the Countess of Riverola she very\r\noften thought of the parent who had reared her tenderly and loved her\r\naffectionately; she thought also of her brother Eugenio, who had ever\r\nbeen so devoted to his sister. But she kept her promise faithfully for\r\nfive years; until that fatal day of April, 1500, which our father has so\r\nemphatically mentioned in his narrative. It was in the garden belonging\r\nto the ducal palace that she suddenly encountered her brother\r\nEugenio----\"\r\n\r\n\"Her brother!\" ejaculated Francisco, joyfully. \"Oh! I knew, I felt\r\ncertain that she was innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she was indeed innocent,\" repeated Nisida, \"But let me pursue my\r\nexplanations as succinctly as possible. It appeared that the old\r\nman--the executioner of Naples--was no more; and Eugenio, possessing\r\nhimself of the hoardings of his deceased father, had fled from his\r\nnative city to avoid the dread necessity of assuming the abhorrent\r\noffice. Accident led the young adventurer to Florence in search of a\r\nmore agreeable employment as a means whereby to earn his livelihood, and\r\nhaving formed the acquaintance of one of the duke's valets, he obtained\r\nadmittance to the gardens on that memorable evening when the grand\r\nentertainment was given. In spite of the strict injunctions he had\r\nreceived not to approach the places occupied by the distinguished\r\nguests, he drew near the arbor in which our mother had been conversing\r\nwith other ladies, but where she was at that moment alone. The\r\nrecognition was immediate, and they flew into each other's arms. It\r\nwould have been useless, as well as unnatural, for our mother to have\r\nrefused to reveal her rank and name; her brilliant attire was sufficient\r\nto convince her brother that the former was high, and inquiry would\r\nspeedily have made him acquainted with the latter. She accordingly drew\r\nhim apart into a secluded walk and told him all; but she implored him to\r\nquit Florence without delay, and she gave him her purse and one of her\r\nrich bracelets, thereby placing ample resources at his disposal. Five\r\nyears passed away, and during that period she heard no more of her\r\nbrother Eugenio. But at the expiration of that interval she received a\r\nnote stating that he was again in Florence--that necessity had alone\r\nbrought him hither, and that he would be at a particular place at a\r\ncertain hour to meet either herself or some confidential person whom she\r\nmight instruct to see him. Our mother filled a bag with gold, and put\r\ninto it some of her choicest jewels, and thus provided, she repaired in\r\nperson to the place of appointment. It grieved her generous heart thus\r\nto be compelled to meet her brother secretly, as if he were a common\r\nrobber or a midnight bravo; but for her husband's peace, and in\r\nobedience to the spirit of the oath which imperious circumstances had\r\nalone led her in some degree to violate, she was forced to adopt that\r\nsad and humiliating alternative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! poor mother!\" sobbed Francisco, deeply affected by this\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n\"Again did five years elapse without bringing tidings to our mother of\r\nEugenio,\" continued Nisida, \"and then he once more set foot in Florence.\r\nThe world bad not used him well--Fortune had frowned upon him--and,\r\nthough a young man of fine spirit and noble disposition, he failed in\r\nall his endeavors to carve out a successful career for himself. Our\r\nmother determined to accord him an interview in her own apartment. She\r\nlonged to converse with him at her ease--to hear his tale from his own\r\nlips--to sympathize with and console him. Oh! who could blame her if in\r\nso doing she departed from the strict and literal meaning of that vow\r\nwhich had bound her to consider her relations as dead to her? But the\r\nfault--if fault it were--was so venial, that to justify it is to invest\r\nit with an importance which it would not have possessed save for the\r\nfrightful results to which it led. You have already heard how foully he\r\nwas waylaid, how ruthlessly he was murdered! Holy Virgin! my brain\r\nwhirls when I reflect upon that hideous cruelty which made our mother\r\nthe spectator of his dissection; for, even had he been a lover--even\r\nwere she guilty--even if the suspicions of our father had all been\r\nwell-founded----\"\r\n\r\n\"Dwell not upon this frightful topic, my beloved Nisida!\" exclaimed\r\nFrancisco, perceiving that she was again becoming greatly excited, for\r\nher eyes dilated and glared wildly, her bosom heaved in awful\r\nconvulsions, and she tossed her arms frantically about.\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not--I dare not pause to ponder thereon,\" she said, falling\r\nback upon the pillow, and pressing her hands to that proud and haughty\r\nbrow behind which the active, racking brain appeared to be on fire.\r\n\r\n\"Tranquilize yourself, dearest sister,\" murmured Flora, bending over the\r\ncouch and pressing her lips on Nisida's burning cheek.\r\n\r\n\"I will, I will, Flora, whom I now love as much as I once hated!\"\r\nexclaimed the dying lady. \"But let me make an end of my explanations.\r\nYou already know that our dear mother was gagged when she was compelled\r\nto witness the horrible deeds enacted in the subterranean charnel-house\r\nby the dim light of a sickly lamp; but even if she had not been, no word\r\nwould have issued from her lips, as the manuscript justly observes.\r\nDuring her illness, however, she sought an interview with her husband\r\nfor the purpose of proving to him her complete innocence, by revealing\r\nthe fact that his victim was her own brother! But he refused all the\r\nentreaties proffered with that object, and our unfortunate mother was\r\nforced to contemplate the approach of death with the sad conviction that\r\nshe should pass away without the satisfaction of establishing her\r\nguiltlessness in the eyes of our father. Then was it that she revealed\r\neverything to me--to me alone--to me, a young girl of only fifteen when\r\nthose astounding facts were breathed into my ears. I listened with\r\nhorror, and I began to hate my father, for I adored my mother. She\r\nimplored me not to give way to any intemperate language or burst of\r\npassion which might induce the inmates of the mansion to suspect that I\r\nwas the depositary of some terrible secret.\r\n\r\n\"'For,' said our mother, when on her death-bed, 'if I have ventured to\r\nshock your young mind by so appalling a revelation, it is only that you\r\nmay understand wherefore I am about to bind you by a solemn vow to love,\r\nprotect, and watch over Francisco, as if he were your own child, rather\r\nthan your brother. His father, alas! hates him. This I have observed\r\never since the birth of that dear boy, but it is only by means of the\r\ndread occurrence of the other night that I have been able to divine the\r\norigin of that dislike and unnatural loathing. Your father, Nisida,'\r\ncontinued my mother, 'believes that I have been unfaithful, and suspects\r\nthat Francisco is the offspring of a guilty _amour_. With this terrible\r\nimpression upon his mind, he may persecute my poor boy; he may\r\ndisinherit him; he may even seek to rid him of life. Kneel, then, by my\r\nbedside, Nisida, and swear by all you deem sacred--by the love you bear\r\nfor me--and by your hopes of salvation, that you will watch unweariedly\r\nand unceasingly over the welfare and the interests of Francisco--that\r\nyou will make any sacrifice, incur any danger, or undergo any privation,\r\nto save him from the effects of his father's hate--that you will exert\r\nall possible means to cause the title and fortune of his father to\r\ndescend to him, and that you will in no case consent to supplant him in\r\nthose respects--and lastly, that you will keep secret the dread history\r\nof my brother's fate and your knowledge of your father's crime.' To all\r\nthese conditions of the vow I solemnly and sacredly pledged myself,\r\ncalling Heaven to witness the oath. But I said to our mother, 'My father\r\nwill not forever remain locked up in his own apartment; he will come\r\nforth sooner or later, and I must have an opportunity of speaking to\r\nhim. May I not justify you, my dear mother, in his eyes? May I not\r\nassure him that Eugenio was your brother? He will then cease to hate\r\nFrancisco, and may even love him as he loves me; and you may then have\r\nno fears on his account.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Alas! the plan which you suggest may not be put into execution,'\r\nreplied our dying mother; 'for were your father to be aware that I had\r\nrevealed the occurrences of that dread night to you, Nisida, he would\r\nfeel that he must be ever looked upon as a murderer by his own child!\r\nMoreover, such appears to be the sad and benighted state of his mind,\r\nthat he might peradventure deem the tale relative to Eugenio a mere\r\nexcuse and vile subterfuge. No; I must perish disgraced in his eyes,\r\nunless he should accord ere I die, the interview which yourself and the\r\ngood Dr. Duras have so vainly implored him to grant me.'\r\n\r\n\"Our dear mother then proceeded to give me other instructions,\r\nFrancisco, relative to yourself; but these,\" added Nisida, glancing\r\ntoward Flora, \"would _now_ be painful to unfold. And yet,\" she\r\ncontinued, hastily, as a second thought struck her, \"it is impossible,\r\nmy sweet Flora, that you can be weak-minded--for you have this day seen\r\nand heard enough to test your mental powers to the extreme possibility\r\nof their endurance. Moreover, I feel that my conduct toward you requires\r\na complete justification; and that justification will be found in the\r\nlast instructions which I received from the lips of my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dearest Nisida,\" said the young countess, \"no justification is\r\nneeded--no apology is required in reference to that subject; for your\r\nkind words, your altered manner toward me now, your recognition of me as\r\na sister, made so by union with your brother--oh! this would efface from\r\nmy mind wrongs ten thousand times more terrible than any injury which I\r\nhave sustained at your hands. But,\" continued Flora, in a slow and\r\ngentle tone, \"if you wish to explain the nature of these instructions\r\nwhich you received from the lips of your dying parent, let not my\r\npresence embarrass you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do wish to render my explanation as complete as possible,\r\ndearest Flora,\" replied Nisida; \"for if I have acted severely toward\r\nyou, it was not to gratify any natural love of cruelty, nor any mean\r\njealousy or spite; on the contrary, the motives were engendered by that\r\nimperious necessity which has swayed my conduct, modeled my disposition,\r\nand regulated my mind ever since that fatal day when I knelt beside my\r\nmother's death-bed, and swore to obey her last words. For thus did she\r\nspeak, Flora--'Nisida, there is one more subject relative to which I\r\nmust advise you, and in respect to which you must swear to obey me. My\r\nown life furnished a sad and terrible lesson of the impropriety of\r\ncontracting an unequal marriage. All my woes--all my sorrows--all the\r\ndreadful events which have occurred--may be traced to the one great fact\r\nthat the Count of Riverola espoused a person of whose family he was\r\nashamed. Nisida,' she continued, her voice becoming fainter and fainter,\r\n'watch you narrowly and closely over the welfare of Francisco in this\r\nrespect. Let him not marry beneath him; let him not unite himself to one\r\nwhose family contains a single member deserving obloquy or reproach.\r\nAbove all, see that he marries not till he shall have reached an age\r\nwhen he will be capable of examining his own heart through the medium of\r\nexperience and matured judgment. If you see him form a boyish attachment\r\nof which you have good and sufficient reason to disapprove, exert\r\nyourself to wean him from it: hesitate not to thwart him; be not moved\r\nby the sorrows he may manifest at the moment; you will be acting for his\r\nwelfare; and the time will speedily come when he will rejoice that you\r\nhave rescued him from the danger of contracting a hasty, rash, and\r\nill-assorted marriage.' These were the last instructions of our mother,\r\nFrancisco; and I swore to obey them. Hence my sorrow, my fears, my anger\r\nwhen I became aware of the attachment subsisting between yourself, dear\r\nbrother, and you, my sweet Flora: and that sorrow was enhanced--those\r\nfears were augmented--that danger was increased, Flora, when I learnt\r\nthat your brother Alessandro had renounced the creed of the true God,\r\nand that your family thereby contained a member deserving of obloquy and\r\nreproach. But that sorrow, those fears, and that anger have now departed\r\nfrom my soul. I recognize the finger of Heaven--the will of the Almighty\r\nin the accomplishment of your union, despite of all my projects, all my\r\nintrigues to prevent it. I am satisfied, moreover, that there is in this\r\nalliance a fitness and a propriety which will insure your happiness: and\r\nmay the spirit of my sainted mother look down from the empyrean palace\r\nwhere she dwells, and bless you both, even as I now implore the divine\r\nmercy to shed its beauties and diffuse its protecting influence around\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nNisida had raised herself up to a sitting posture as she uttered this\r\ninvocation so sublimely interesting and solemnly sincere; and the\r\nyouthful pair, simultaneously yielding to the same impulse, sank upon\r\ntheir knees to receive the blessing of one who had never bestowed a\r\nblessing on mortal being until then! She extended her hands above those\r\ntwo beautiful, bending heads: and her voice, as she adjured Heaven to\r\nprotect them, was plaintively earnest and tremulously clear, and its\r\nmusical sound seemed to touch the finest chord of sympathy, devotion,\r\nand love that vibrated in the hearts of that youthful noble and his\r\nvirgin bride. When this solemn ceremony was accomplished, an immense\r\nweight appeared to have been removed from the soul of the Lady Nisida of\r\nRiverola; and her countenance wore a calm and sweet expression, which\r\nformed a happy contrast with the sovereign hauteur and grand contempt\r\nthat were wont to mark it.\r\n\r\n\"I have now but little more to say in explanation of my past conduct,\"\r\nshe resumed, after a long pause. \"You can readily divine wherefore I\r\naffected the loss of those most glorious faculties which God has given\r\nme. I became enthusiastic in my resolves to carry out the injunctions of\r\nmy dear and much-loved mother; and while I lay upon a bed of sickness--a\r\nsevere illness produced by anguish and horror at all I had heard from\r\nher lips, and by her death, so premature and sad--I pondered a thousand\r\nschemes, the object of which was to accomplish the great aims I had in\r\nview. I foresaw that I--a weak woman--then, indeed, a mere girl of\r\nfifteen--should have to constitute myself the protectress of a brother\r\nwho was hated by his own father; and I feared lest that hatred should\r\ndrive him to the adoption of some dreadful plot to rid himself of your\r\npresence, Francisco--perhaps even to deprive you of your life. I knew\r\nthat I must watch all his movements and listen to all his conversations\r\nwith those unprincipled wretches who are ever ready to do the bidding of\r\nthe powerful and the wealthy. But how was all this to be\r\naccomplished?--how was I to become a watcher and a listener--a spy ever\r\nactive, and an eavesdropper ever awake--without exciting suspicions\r\nwhich would lead to the frustration of my designs, and perhaps involve\r\nboth myself and my brother in ruin? Then was it that an idea struck me\r\nlike a flash of lightning; and like a flash of lightning was it terrible\r\nand appalling, when breaking on the dark chaos of my thoughts. At first\r\nI shrank from it--recoiled from it in horror and dismay;--but the more I\r\nconsidered it--the longer I looked that idea in the face--the more I\r\ncontemplated it, the less formidable did it seem. I have already said\r\nthat I was enthusiastic and devoted in my resolves to carry out the\r\ndying injunctions of my mother:--and thus by degrees I learnt to reflect\r\nupon the awful sacrifice which had suggested itself to my imagination as\r\na species of holy and necessary self-martyrdom. I foresaw that if I\r\naffected the loss of hearing and speech, I should obtain all the\r\nadvantages I sought and all the means I required to enable me to act as\r\nthe protectress of my brother against the hatred of my father. I\r\nbelieved also that I should not only be considered as unfit to be made\r\nthe heiress of the title and fortune of the Riverola family, but that\r\nour father, Francisco, would see the absolute necessity of treating you\r\nin all respects as his lawful and legitimate son, in spite of any\r\nsuspicions which he might entertain relative to your birth. There were\r\nmany other motives which influenced me, and which arose out of the\r\ninjunctions of our mother,--motives which you can well understand, and\r\nwhich I need not detail. Thus it was that, subduing the grief which the\r\nidea of making so tremendous a sacrifice excited, on the one hand--and\r\narming myself with the exultation of a martyr, on the other,--thus it\r\nwas that I resolved to simulate the character of the deaf and dumb. It\r\nwas, however, necessary to obtain the collusion of Dr. Duras; and this\r\naim I carried after many hours of argument and persuasion. He was then\r\nignorant--and still is ignorant--of the real motives which had prompted\r\nme to this self-martyrdom;--but I led him to believe that the gravest\r\nand most important family interests required that moral immolation of my\r\nown happiness;--and I vowed that unless he would consent to aid me, it\r\nwas my firm resolve to shut myself up in a convent and take the veil.\r\nThis threat, which I had not the least design of carrying into effect,\r\ninduced him to yield a reluctant acquiescence with my project: for he\r\nloved me as if I had been his child. He was moreover consoled somewhat\r\nby the assurance which I gave him, and in which I myself felt implicit\r\nconfidence at the time, that the necessity for the simulation of\r\ndeafness and dumbness on my part would cease the moment my father should\r\nbe no more. In a word, the kind Dr. Duras promised to act entirely in\r\naccordance with my wishes; and I accordingly became Nisida the deaf and\r\ndumb!\"\r\n\r\n\"Merciful heavens! that immeasurable sacrifice was made for me!\" cried\r\nFrancisco, throwing himself into the arms of his sister and imprinting a\r\nthousand kisses on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--for your sake and in order to carry out the dying commands of our\r\nmother, the sainted Vitangela?\" responded Nisida. \"I shall not weary you\r\nwith a description of the feelings and emotions with which I commenced\r\nthat long career of duplicity; by the very success that attended the\r\npart which I had undertaken to perform you may estimate the magnitude\r\nand the extent of the exertions which it cost me thus to maintain myself\r\na living--a constant--and yet undetected lie! Ten years passed away--ten\r\nyears, marked by many incidents which made me rejoice, for your sake,\r\nFrancisco, that I had accepted the self-martyrdom which circumstances\r\nhad suggested to me. At length our father lay upon his death bed: and\r\nthen--oh! then I rejoiced--yes, rejoiced, though he was dying; for I\r\nthought that the end of my career of duplicity was at hand. Judge, then,\r\nof my astonishment--my grief--my despair, when I heard the last\r\ninjunctions which our father addressed to you, Francisco, on that bed of\r\ndeath. What could the mystery of the closet mean? Of that I _then_ knew\r\nnothing. Wherefore was I to remain in complete ignorance of the\r\ninstructions thus given to you? And what was signified by the words\r\nrelative to the disposal of our father's property? For you may remember\r\nthat he spoke thus, addressing himself of course to you:--'You will find\r\nthat I have left the whole of my property to you. At the same time my\r\nwill specifies certain conditions relative to your sister Nisida, for\r\nwhom I have made due provision only in the case--which is, alas! almost\r\nin defiance of every hope!--of her recovery from that dreadful\r\naffliction which renders her so completely dependent upon your\r\nkindness.' These ominous and mysterious words seemed to proclaim defeat\r\nand overthrow to all the hopes that I had formed relative to the\r\ncertainty of your being left the sole and unconditional heir alike to\r\ntitle and estate. I therefore resolved to maintain the character of the\r\ndeaf and dumb until I should have fathomed the secrets of the closet,\r\nand have become acquainted with the conditions of the will. Oh! well do\r\nI remember the glance which the generous-hearted Duras cast toward me,\r\nwhen, returning to the chamber, he inquired by means of that significant\r\nlook whether the last words of our dying father were prognostic of hope\r\nfor me--whether, indeed, the necessity of sustaining the dreadful\r\nduplicity would cease when he should be no more. And I remember, also,\r\nthat the look and the sign, by which I conveyed a negative answer were\r\nexpressive of the deep melancholy that filled his soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! my dear self-sacrificed sister,\" murmured Francisco, tears\r\ntrickling down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--my disappointment was cruel indeed,\" continued Nisida. \"But the\r\nexcitement of the scenes and incidents which followed rapidly the death\r\nof our father, restored my mind to its wonted tone of fortitude, vigor,\r\nand proud determination. That very night, Francisco, I took the key of\r\nthe cabinet from your garments, while you slept--I sped to the chamber\r\nof death--I visited the depository of horrible mysteries--and for the\r\nfirst time I became aware that two skeletons were contained in that\r\ncloset! And whose fleshless relics those skeletons were, the dreadful\r\nmanuscript speedily revealed to me. Then was it also for the first time\r\nthat I learnt how Margaretha was the detestable spy whose agency had led\r\nto such a frightful catastrophe in respect to Eugenio and Vitangela;\r\nthen I became aware that our mother's corpse slept not in the vault to\r\nwhich a coffin had been consigned:--in a word, the full measure of our\r\nsire's atrocity--O God! that I should be compelled thus to speak--was\r\nrevealed to me! But on Margaretha have I been avenged,\" added Nisida, in\r\na low tone, and with a convulsive shudder produced by the recollection\r\nof that terrible night when she immolated the miserable woman above the\r\ngrave where lay a portion of the remains of her mother and of Eugenio.\r\n\r\n\"You have been avenged on Margaretha, sister,\" ejaculated Francisco,\r\nsurveying Nisida with apprehension.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she replied, her large black eyes flashing with a scintillation\r\nof the former fires: \"that woman--I have slain her! But start not,\r\nFlora--look not reproachfully upon me, Francisco: 'twas a deed fully\r\njustified, a vengeance righteously exercised, a penalty well deserved!\r\nAnd now let me hasten to bring my long and tedious explanations to a\r\nconclusion--for they have occupied a longer space than I had at first\r\nanticipated, and I am weak and faint. Little, however, remains to be\r\ntold. The nature of our father's will compelled me to persist in my\r\nself-martyrdom: for I had sworn to my dying mother not to accept any\r\nconditions or advantages which should have the effect of disinheriting\r\nyou, Francisco.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what a debt of gratitude do I owe thee, my beloved sister!\"\r\nexclaimed the young count, deeply affected by the generous sacrifices\r\nmade by Nisida on his behalf.\r\n\r\n\"And think you I have experienced no reward?\" asked the lady in a sweet\r\ntone, and with a placid smile: \"do you imagine that the consciousness of\r\nhaving devoted myself to the fulfillment of my adored mother's wishes\r\nhas been no recompense? Yes--I have had my consolations and my hours of\r\nhappiness, as well as my sufferings and periods of profound affliction.\r\nBut I feel a soft and heavenly repose stealing over me--'tis a sweet\r\nsleep, and yet it is not the slumber of death! No, no; 'tis a delicious\r\ntrance into which I am falling--'tis as if a celestial vision----\"\r\n\r\nShe said no more. Her eyes closed, she fell back and slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\"Merciful Heavens! my sister is no more!\" exclaimed Francisco, in terror\r\nand despair.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, my beloved husband,\" said Flora; \"Nisida sleeps, and 'tis a\r\nhealthy slumber. The pulsations of her heart are regular; her breath\r\ncomes freely. Joy, joy, Francisco, she will recover!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Holy Virgin grant that your hope may be fulfilled!\" returned the\r\nyoung count. \"But let us not disturb her. We will sit down by the\r\nbedside, Flora, and watch till she shall awake.\"\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had he uttered these words when the door of the chamber\r\nopened, and an old man of venerable appearance, and with a long beard as\r\nwhite as snow, advanced toward the newly married pair.\r\n\r\nFrancisco and Flora beheld him with feelings of reverence and awe, for\r\nsomething appeared to tell them that he was a mortal of no common order.\r\n\r\n\"My dear children,\" he said, addressing them in a paternal manner, and\r\nhis voice firm, but mild, \"ye need not watch here for the present.\r\nRetire, and seek not this chamber again until the morning of to-morrow.\r\nFear nothing, excellent young man, for thou hast borne arms in the cause\r\nof the cross. Fear nothing, amiable young lady, for thou art attended by\r\nguardian angels.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the venerable man thus addressed them severally, he extended his\r\nhands to bless them; and they received that blessing with holy meekness,\r\nand yet with a joyous feeling which appeared to be of glorious augury\r\nfor their future happiness. Then, obedient to the command of the\r\nstranger, they slowly quitted the apartment--urged to yield to his will\r\nby a secret influence which they could not resist, but which\r\nnevertheless animated them with a pious confidence in the integrity of\r\nhis purpose. The door closed behind them, and Christian Rosencrux\r\nremained in the room with the dead Wagner and the dying Nisida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the incidents related in the last few chapters were taking place\r\nat the Riverola Palace, the council of state had assembled to receive\r\nthe grand vizier, the mighty Ibrahim, who had signified his intention of\r\nmeeting that august body at three o'clock in the afternoon. Accordingly,\r\nas soon as he had witnessed the marriage ceremony which united his\r\nsister to the Count of Riverola, he returned from Wagner's mansion to\r\nhis own pavilion in the midst of the Ottoman encampment. There he\r\narrayed him in a manner becoming his exalted rank, and mounting his\r\nsplendid caparisoned steed, he repaired with a brilliant escort to the\r\nducal palace. The streets of the city of Florence were thronged with\r\nmultitudes eager to gain a sight of the representative of the sultan--a\r\nview of the man whose will and pleasure swayed the greatest empire in\r\nexistence at that period of the world's age!\r\n\r\nAnd as Ibrahim passed through those avenues so well known to\r\nhim--threaded those thoroughfares, each feature of which was so\r\nindelibly impressed upon his memory--and beheld many, many familiar\r\nspots, all of which awakened in his mind reminiscences of a happy\r\nchildhood, and of years gone by; when, too, he reflected that he had\r\nquitted Florence poor, obscure, and unmarked amidst the millions of his\r\nfellow-men; and that now, as he entered the beauteous city, multitudes\r\ncame forth to gaze upon him, as on one invested with a high rank and\r\nenjoying a power mighty to do much; when he thought of all this, his\r\nbosom swelled with mingled emotions of pride and tenderness, regret and\r\njoy; and while tears trembled upon his long black lashes, a smile of\r\nhaughty triumph played on his lips. On, on the procession goes, through\r\nthe crowded streets and across the spacious squares, watched by the eyes\r\nof transcendent beauty and proud aristocracy from the balconies of\r\npalaces and the casements of lordly mansions; on, on, amidst a wondering\r\nand admiring populace, and grateful, too, that so great a chief as\r\nIbrahim should have spared their city from sack and ruin.\r\n\r\nAt length the grand vizier, attended by the great beglerbegs and pashas\r\nof his army, entered the square of the ducal palace; and as his prancing\r\nsteed bore him proudly beneath the massive arch, the roar of artillery\r\nannounced to the City of Flowers that the Ottoman Minister was now\r\nwithin the precincts of the dwelling of the Florentine sovereign. The\r\nduke and the members of the council of state were all assembled in the\r\ncourt of the Palazzo to receive the illustrious visitor, who, having\r\ndismounted from his horse, accompanied the prince and those high\r\ndignitaries to the council-chamber. When the personages thus assembled\r\nhad taken their seats around the spacious table, covered with a rich red\r\nvelvet cloth, the grand vizier proceeded to address the duke and the\r\ncouncilors.\r\n\r\n\"High and mighty prince, and noble and puissant lords,\" he said, in the\r\ntone of one conscious of his power, \"I am well satisfied with the manner\r\nin which my demands have been fulfilled up to this moment. Two ladies,\r\nin whom I feel a deep and sincere interest, and who were most unjustly\r\nimprisoned to suit the vindictive purposes of the Count of Arestino,\r\nhave been delivered up to me: and ye have likewise agreed to make full\r\nand adequate atonement for the part which Florence enacted in the late\r\ncontest between the Christians and Mussulmans in the Island of Rhodes. I\r\nhave therefore determined to reduce my demands upon the republic, for\r\nindemnity and compensation, to as low a figure as my own dignity and a\r\nsense of that duty which I owe to my sovereign (whom God preserve many\r\ndays!) will permit. The sum that I now require from your treasury,\r\nmighty prince and puissant lords, is a hundred thousand pistoles; and in\r\naddition thereto, I claim peculiar privileges for Ottoman vessels\r\ntrading to Leghorn, guaranty of peace on the part of the republic for\r\nthree years, and the release of such prisoners now in the dungeons of\r\nthe inquisition, whom it may seem good to me thus to mark out as\r\ndeserving of your mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"A hundred thousand pistoles, my lord, would completely exhaust the\r\ntreasury of the republic,\" said the duke, with dismay pictured upon his\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n\"Think you,\" cried the grand vizier, angrily, \"that I shall dare to face\r\nmy imperial master, on my return to Constantinople, unless I be able to\r\nlay at his feet a sum adequate to meet the expenses incurred by this\r\nexpedition of a great fleet and a powerful army?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your highness will at least accord us a few days wherein to obtain the\r\namount required,\" said the duke, \"for it will be necessary to levy a tax\r\nupon the republic!\"\r\n\r\n\"I grant you until sunset, my lord--until sunset this evening.\" added\r\nthe grand vizier, speaking with stern emphasis. \"And if you will permit\r\nme to tender my advice, you will at once command the grand inquisitor\r\nand the Count of Arestino to furnish the sum required: for the former, I\r\nam inclined to suspect, is a most unjust judge, and the latter, I am\r\nwell convinced, is a most cruel and revengeful noble.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Count of Arestino is no more, your highness,\" answered the duke.\r\n\"The Marquis of Orsini murdered him before the very eyes of the grand\r\ninquisitor, and will therefore head the procession of victims at the\r\napproaching _auto-da-fe_.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the footstool of Allah! that shall not be!\" exclaimed Ibrahim. \"The\r\nmachinations of the Count of Arestino threw into the inquisition\r\ndungeons those two ladies whom ye delivered up to me last night; and it\r\nwas my intention, when I spoke of releasing certain prisoners ere now,\r\nto stipulate for the freedom of all those whom the vengeance of that\r\ncount has immured in your accursed prison-house. See then, my lords,\r\nthat all those of whom I speak be forthwith brought hither into our\r\npresence!\"\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to inform the reader that Flora had solicited her\r\nbrother to save the Marquis of Orsini and the Countess Giulia, to whom\r\nthe young wife of Francisco had been indebted for her escape from the\r\nCarmelite Convent; for, as the secrets of the torture chamber were never\r\nsuffered to transpire, she was of course ignorant of the death of the\r\nguilty Giulia, and of the assassination of the Count of Arestino by the\r\nMarquis of Orsini.\r\n\r\nAt the command of Ibrahim Pasha, who spoke in a firm and resolute\r\nmanner, the duke summoned a sentinel from the corridor adjoining the\r\ncouncil chamber, and issued the necessary orders to fulfill the desire\r\nof the grand vizier. Nearly a quarter of an hour elapsed during which\r\none of the councilors drew up the guaranty of peace and of the\r\ncommercial privileges demanded by Ibrahim. At length the door opened,\r\nand several familiars made their appearance, leading in Manuel d'Orsini\r\nand Isaachar ben Solomon, both heavily chained. The former walked with\r\nhead erect, and proud bearing; the latter could scarcely drag his\r\nwasted, racked, and tottering limbs along, and was compelled to hang\r\nupon the arms of the familiars for support. Nevertheless, there was\r\nsomething so meek--so patient and so resigned in the expression of the\r\nold and persecuted Israelite's countenance, that Ibrahim Pasha's soul\r\nwas touched with a sentiment of pity in his behalf.\r\n\r\n\"But these are not all the prisoners,\" exclaimed the grand vizier,\r\nturning angrily toward the duke; \"where is the Countess Giulia of\r\nArestino?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, she is no more,\" answered the prince.\r\n\r\n\"And Heaven be thanked that she is indeed no more!\" cried Manuel\r\nd'Orsini, in a tone of mingled rage and bitterness. \"Fortunate is it for\r\nher that death has snatched her away from the grasp of miscreants in\r\nhuman shape and who call themselves Christians. My lord,\" he continued,\r\nturning toward Ibrahim, \"I know not who you are; but I perceive by your\r\ngarb that you are a Moslem, and I presume that your rank is high by the\r\ntitle addressed to you by the duke----\"\r\n\r\n\"Presume not thus to intrude your observations on his highness the grand\r\nvizier!\" exclaimed one of the councilors in a severe tone.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Ibrahim Pasha, \"let him speak, and without\r\nreserve. My Lord of Orsini, fear not--I will protect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The remark I was about to make, illustrious vizier,\" cried Manuel, \"is\r\nbrief, though it may prove not palatable to the patrons of the\r\ninquisition and the supporters of that awful engine of despotism and\r\ncruelty,\" he added, glancing fiercely at the duke and the assembled\r\ncouncilors. \"I was anxious to observe that the Christian Church has\r\nfounded and maintained that abhorrent institution; and that there is\r\nmore true mercy--more genuine sympathy--and more of the holy spirit of\r\nforgiveness in the breast of this reviled, despised and persecuted Jew,\r\nthan in the bosoms of all the miserable hypocrites who have dared to\r\nsanction the infernal tortures which have been inflicted upon him. For\r\nmyself, I would not accept mercy at their hands; and I would rather go\r\nin the companionship of this Jew to the funeral pile, than remain alive\r\nto dwell amongst a race of incarnate fiends, calling themselves\r\nChristians!\"\r\n\r\n\"This insolence is not to be borne,\" exclaimed the duke, starting from\r\nhis seat, his countenance glowing with indignation.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness and all the councilors now assembled well merit the\r\nreproaches of the Marquis of Orsini,\" said the grand vizier, sternly.\r\n\"But it is for _me_ to command here, and for _you_ to obey, proud\r\nprince! Let the chains be removed from those prisoners forthwith.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke sank back in his chair, and, subduing his rage as well as he\r\nwas able, he made a sign to the familiars to set the Jew and the marquis\r\nat liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Grand vizier,\" exclaimed Manuel, \"the life and the liberty which, at\r\nyour all-powerful nod are restored to me will prove irksome and\r\nvalueless if I be compelled to remain in a Christian land. Confer not\r\nfavors by halves, my lord--render me completely grateful to you! Take me\r\ninto your service--even as a slave, if your highness will; but let me\r\naccompany to a Mussulman country a Mussulman who can teach the\r\nChristians such a fine lesson of mercy and forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall go with me to Constantinople, Manuel--but not as a slave,\"\r\nreturned Ibrahim, profoundly touched by the sincere tone and earnest\r\nmanner of the young noble; \"no--you shall accompany me as a friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand thanks, grand vizier, for this kindness--this generosity!\"\r\nsaid the marquis, deeply affected; then as a sudden idea struck him, he\r\nturned toward the Jew exclaiming, \"But we must not leave this old man\r\nbehind us. 'Twere the same as if we were to abandon a helpless child in\r\nthe midst of a forest inhabited by ferocious wolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--yes--let me accompany you, excellent young man!\" murmured\r\nIsaachar, clinging to the arm of the marquis, for their chains were now\r\nknocked off. \"You were the first Christian who ever spoke kindly to me;\r\nand I have no kith--no kindred on the face of the earth. I am a\r\nlone--desolate old man; but I have wealth--much wealth, Manuel\r\nd'Orsini--and all that I have shall be thine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Jew shall accompany us, my lord,\" said Ibrahim, addressing himself\r\nto the marquis; then, turning toward the duke, he exclaimed in a severe\r\ntone, \"But a few hours remain till sunset, and the ransom of a hundred\r\nthousand pistoles must be paid to me; or I will deliver up this proud\r\npalace and the homes of the councilors now assembled to the pillage of\r\nmy troops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay--nay, my lord!\" cried the Jew, horror-struck at the threat; \"bring\r\nnot the terrors of sack, and storm, and carnage into this fair city! A\r\nhundred thousand pistoles, your highness says,--a hundred thousand\r\npistoles,\" he added, in a slower and more musing tone; \"'tis a large\r\nsum--a very large sum! And yet--to save so many men and their innocent\r\nfamilies from ruin--from desolation---- Yes, my lord,\" he exclaimed,\r\nhastily interrupting himself--\"I--I will pay you the ransom-money.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--by Allah!\" ejaculated Ibrahim; \"not a single pistole shall be thus\r\nextorted from thee! Sooner shall the Florentine Treasury grant thee an\r\nindemnification for the horrible tortures which thou hast endured, than\r\nthy wealth be poured forth to furnish this ransom-money. Come, my Lord\r\nof Orsini--come, worthy Jew,\" continued the grand vizier, rising from\r\nhis seat, \"we will depart to the Ottoman encampment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, your highness, for a few hours,\" urged the duke, \"and the\r\nhundred thousand pistoles shall be counted out before thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor man,\" answered the grand vizier, indicating the Jew with a\r\nrapid glance, \"has been so racked and tortured in your accursed\r\nprison-house, that he cannot be too speedily placed under the care of my\r\nown chirurgeon. For this reason I depart at once; see that the ransom be\r\ndispatched to my pavilion ere the sun shall have set behind the western\r\nhills.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words the grand vizier bowed haughtily to the duke, and\r\nquitted the council chamber. Manuel d'Orsini followed, supporting\r\nIsaachar ben Solomon; and, on reaching the court, one of Ibrahim's\r\nslaves took the Jew up behind him on his steed. The marquis was provided\r\nwith a horse; and the cavalcade moved rapidly away from the precincts of\r\nthe ducal palace. Profiting by the hint which Ibrahim Pasha had offered\r\nthem, the duke and the councilors instantly levied a heavy fine upon the\r\ngrand inquisitor; and the remainder of the money required to make up the\r\namount demanded, was furnished from the public treasury. Thus by the\r\nhour of sunset the ransom was paid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt an early hour on the ensuing morning, Francisco di Riverola and his\r\nbeautiful, blushing bride quitted the chamber where they had passed the\r\nnight in each other's arms, and repaired to the apartment where so many\r\nterrible mysteries had been revealed to them, and so many dreadful\r\nincidents had occurred on the preceding day. Hand in hand they had\r\ntraversed the passages and the corridors leading to that room in which\r\nthey had left Christian Rosencrux with the dead Wagner and the dying\r\nNisida; hand in hand and silently they went--that fine young noble and\r\ncharming bride!\r\n\r\nOn reaching the door of the chamber, Francisco knocked gently; and the\r\nglance of intelligence which passed between himself and Flora showed\r\nthat each was a prey to the same breathless suspense; the same mingled\r\nfeelings of bright hopes and vague fears. In a few moments the door was\r\nslowly opened; and the venerable old man appeared, his countenance\r\nwearing a solemn and mournful aspect. Then Francisco and the young\r\ncountess knew that all was over; and tears started into their eyes.\r\n\r\nChristian Rosencrux beckoned them to advance toward the bed, around\r\nwhich the curtains were drawn closer; and as they entered the room, the\r\nrapid and simultaneous glances which they cast toward the spot where\r\nFernand Wagner fell down and surrendered up his breath, showed them that\r\nthe corpse had been removed. Approaching the bed with slow and measured\r\nsteps, Rosencrux drew aside the drapery; and for a moment Francisco and\r\nFlora shrank back from the spectacle which met their view; but at the\r\nnext instant they advanced to the couch, and contemplated with mournful\r\nattention the scene presented to them. For there--upon that couch--side\r\nby side, lay Fernand Wagner and Nisida of Riverola--stiff, motionless,\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\"Grieve not for her loss, children,\" said Christian Rosencrux; \"she has\r\ngone to a happier realm--for the sincere repentance which she manifested\r\nin her last hours has atoned for all the evil she wrought in her\r\nlifetime. From the moment, young lady, when she banished from her soul\r\nthe rancor long harbored there against thee--from the instant that she\r\nreceived thee in her arms, and called thee sister--the blessing of\r\nHeaven was vouchsafed unto her. She was penitent, very penitent, while I\r\nadministered to her the consolations of religion, and a complete change\r\ncame over her mind. Grieve not, then, for her; happy on earth she never\r\ncould have been again--but happy in heaven she doubtless now is!\"\r\n\r\nFrancisco and the young countess knelt by the side of the couch, and\r\nprayed for a long time in silence, with their faces buried in their\r\nhands. When they again raised their heads, and glanced around, the\r\nvenerable old man no longer met their eyes. Christian Rosencrux had\r\ndeparted, leaving Francisco and Flora in complete ignorance of his name;\r\nbut they experienced a secret conviction that he was something more than\r\nan ordinary mortal; and the remembrance of the blessing which he had\r\nbestowed upon them the preceding day, shed a soothing and holy influence\r\nover their minds.\r\n\r\nLittle now remains to be said; a few brief observations and a rapid\r\nglance at the eventual fortunes and fates of the leading characters in\r\nthe tale, will acquit us of our task. Nisida and Wagner were entombed in\r\nthe same vault; and their names were inscribed upon the same mural\r\ntablet. The funeral was conducted with the utmost privacy--and the\r\nmourners were few, but their grief was sincere. And among them was Dr.\r\nDuras, who had loved Nisida as if she had been his own child. On the\r\nnight following the one on which these obsequies took place, another\r\nfuneral procession departed from the Riverola Palace to the adjacent\r\nchurch; and two coffins were on this occasion, as on the former,\r\nconsigned to the family tomb. But the ceremony was conducted with even\r\nmore privacy than the first; and one mourner alone was present. This was\r\nFrancisco himself; and thus did he perform the sad duty of interring in\r\nsacred ground the remains of his ill-fated mother Vitangela and her\r\nbrother Eugenio. The manuscript of the late Count of Riverola was burnt;\r\nthe closet which so long contained such fearful mysteries was walled up;\r\nthe chamber where so many dreadful incidents had occurred was never used\r\nduring the lifetime of Francisco and Flora. The grand vizier remained\r\nwith his army a few days beneath the walls of Florence: and during that\r\ntime Isaachar ben Solomon so far recovered his health and strength,\r\nunder the skillful care of an Egyptian physician, as to be able to visit\r\nhis dwelling in the suburb of Alla Croce, and secure the immense wealth\r\nwhich he had amassed during a long life of activity and financial\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of the grand vizier's departure arrived, he took a tender\r\nfarewell of his sister Flora and his aunt, both of whom he loaded with\r\nthe most costly presents; and in return, he received from Francisco a\r\ngift of several horses of rare breed and immense value. Nor did this\r\nspecies of interchange of proofs of attachment end here, for every year,\r\nuntil Ibrahim's death, did that great minister and the Count of Riverola\r\nforward to each other letters and rich presents--thus maintaining to the\r\nend that friendship which had commenced in the Island of Rhodes, and\r\nwhich was cemented by the marriage of Francisco and Flora. Isaachar ben\r\nSolomon and Manuel d'Orsini accompanied the grand vizier to\r\nConstantinople, and were treated by him with every mark of distinction.\r\nBut the Jew never completely recovered from the tortures which he had\r\nendured in the prison of the inquisition; and in less than two years\r\nfrom the date of his release, he died in the arms of the marquis, to\r\nwhom he left the whole of his immense fortune. Manuel d'Orsini abjured\r\nChristianity, and entered the Ottoman service, in which his success was\r\nbrilliant and his rise rapid, thanks to the favor of the grand vizier.\r\nThe reader of Ottoman history will find the name of Mustapha Pasha\r\nfrequently mentioned with honor in the reign of Solyman the\r\nMagnificent--and Mustapha Pasha, beglerbeg of the mighty province of\r\nAnatolia, was once Manuel d'Orsini.\r\n\r\nFor nearly sixteen years did Ibrahim Pasha govern the Ottoman realms in\r\nthe name of the sultan: for nearly sixteen years did he hold the\r\nimperial seals which had been intrusted to him at a period when the\r\ncolossal power of the empire seemed tottering to its fall. During that\r\ninterval he raised the Ottoman name to the highest pinnacle of\r\nglory--extended the dominions of his master--and shook the proudest\r\nthrones in Christendom to their foundation. Ferdinand, King of Hungary,\r\ncalled him \"brother,\" and the Emperor Charles the Fifth of Germany\r\nstyled him \"cousin\" in the epistolary communications which passed\r\nbetween them. But a Greek who had long, long cherished a deadly hatred\r\nagainst the puissant grand vizier, at last contrived to enter the\r\nservice of the sultan in the guise of a slave; and this man, succeeding\r\nin gaining that monarch's ear, whispered mysterious warnings against the\r\nambition of Ibrahim. Solyman became alarmed; and, opening his eyes to\r\nthe real position of affairs, perceived that the vizier was indeed far\r\nmore powerful than himself. This was enough to insure the immediate\r\ndestruction of a Turkish minister.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, one evening, Ibrahim was invited to dine with the sultan,\r\nand to sleep at the imperial palace. Never had Solyman appeared more\r\nattached to his favorite than on this occasion and Ibrahim retired to a\r\nchamber prepared for him, with a heart elated by the caresses bestowed\r\nupon him by his imperial master. But in the dead of night he was\r\nawakened by the entrance of several persons into the room; and starting\r\nup with terror, the grand vizier beheld _four black slaves_, headed by a\r\nGreek, creep snake-like toward his couch. And that Greek's countenance,\r\nsinister and menacing, was immediately recognized by the affrighted\r\nIbrahim--though more than fifteen years had elapsed since he had set\r\neyes upon those features. Short and ineffectual was the struggle against\r\nthe messengers of death; the accursed bowstring encircled the neck of\r\nthe unhappy Ibrahim, and at the moment when the vindictive Greek drew\r\ntight the fatal noose, the last words which hissed in the ears of the\r\ngrand vizier, were--\"The wrongs of Calanthe are avenged!\"\r\n\r\nThus perished the most powerful minister that ever held the imperial\r\nseals of Ottoman domination;--and the long-pent-up but never subdued\r\nvindictive feelings of Demetrius were assuaged at length! Dame\r\nFrancatelli had long been numbered with those who were gone to their\r\neternal homes when the news of the death of Ibrahim Pasha reached\r\nFlorence. But the Count and Countess of Riverola shed many, many tears\r\nat the sad and untimely fate of the grand vizier.\r\n\r\nTime, however, smooths down all grief; and happiness again returned to\r\nthe Riverola Palace. For when Francisco and Flora looked around them and\r\nbeheld the smiling progeny which had blessed their union,--when they\r\nexperienced the sweet solace of each other's sympathy, the outpourings\r\nof two hearts which beat as one, ever in unison, and filled with a\r\nmutual love which time impaired not,--then they remembered that it was\r\nuseless and wrong to repine against the decrees of Providence; and, in\r\nthis trusting faith in Heaven and in the enjoyment of each other's\r\nunwearying affection, they lived to a good old age--dying at length in\r\nthe arms of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE END.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Wagner, the Wehr-Wolf, by George W.
