It\r\nhappened, perhaps unfortunately for the inquirers into the knowledge of\r\ndiseases, that other sciences had received improvement previous to their\r\nown; whence, instead of comparing the properties belonging to animated\r\nnature with each other, they, idly ingenious, busied themselves in\r\nattempting to explain the laws of life by those of mechanism and chemistry;\r\nthey considered the body as an hydraulic machine, and the fluids as passing\r\nthrough a series of chemical changes, forgetting that animation was its\r\nessential characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe great CREATOR of all things has infinitely diversified the works of his\r\nhands, but has at the same time stamped a certain similitude on the\r\nfeatures of nature, that demonstrates to us, that _the whole is one family\r\nof one parent_. On this similitude is founded all rational analogy; which,\r\nso long as it is concerned in comparing the essential properties of bodies,\r\nleads us to many and important discoveries; but when with licentious\r\nactivity it links together objects, otherwise discordant, by some fanciful\r\nsimilitude; it may indeed collect ornaments for wit and poetry, but\r\nphilosophy and truth recoil from its combinations.\r\n\r\nThe want of a theory, deduced from such strict analogy, to conduct the\r\npractice of medicine is lamented by its professors; for, as a great number\r\nof unconnected facts are difficult to be acquired, and to be reasoned from,\r\nthe art of medicine is in many instances less efficacious under the\r\ndirection of its wisest practitioners; and by that busy crowd, who either\r\nboldly wade in darkness, or are led into endless error by the glare of\r\nfalse theory, it is daily practised to the destruction of thousands; add to\r\nthis the unceasing injury which accrues to the public by the perpetual\r\nadvertisements of pretended nostrums; the minds of the indolent become\r\nsuperstitiously fearful of diseases, which they do not labour under; and\r\nthus become the daily prey of some crafty empyric.\r\n\r\nA theory founded upon nature, that should bind together the scattered facts\r\nof medical knowledge, and converge into one point of view the laws of\r\norganic life, would thus on many accounts contribute to the interest of\r\nsociety. It would capacitate men of moderate abilities to practise the art\r\nof healing with real advantage to the public; it would enable every one of\r\nliterary acquirements to distinguish the genuine disciples of medicine from\r\nthose of boastful effrontery, or of wily address; and would teach mankind\r\nin some important situations the _knowledge of themselves_.\r\n\r\nThere are some modern practitioners, who declaim against medical theory in\r\ngeneral, not considering that to think is to theorize; and that no one can\r\ndirect a method of cure to a person labouring under disease without\r\nthinking, that is, without theorizing; and happy therefore is the patient,\r\nwhose physician possesses the best theory.\r\n\r\nThe words idea, perception, sensation, recollection, suggestion, and\r\nassociation, are each of them used in this treatise in a more limited sense\r\nthan in the writers of metaphysic. The author was in doubt, whether he\r\nshould rather have substituted new words instead of them; but was at length\r\nof opinion, that new definitions of words already in use would be less\r\nburthensome to the memory of the reader.\r\n\r\nA great part of this work has lain by the writer above twenty years, as\r\nsome of his friends can testify: he had hoped by frequent revision to have\r\nmade it more worthy the acceptance of the public; this however his other\r\nperpetual occupations have in part prevented, and may continue to prevent,\r\nas long as he may be capable of revising it; he therefore begs of the\r\ncandid reader to accept of it in its present state, and to excuse any\r\ninaccuracies of expression, or of conclusion, into which the intricacy of\r\nhis subject, the general imperfection of language, or the frailty he has in\r\ncommon with other men, may have betrayed him; and from which he has not the\r\nvanity to believe this treatise to be exempt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nZOONOMIA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\nOF MOTION.\r\n\r\nThe whole of nature may be supposed to consist of two essences or\r\nsubstances; one of which may be termed spirit, and the other matter. The\r\nformer of these possesses the power to commence or produce motion, and the\r\nlatter to receive and communicate it. So that motion, considered as a\r\ncause, immediately precedes every effect; and, considered as an effect, it\r\nimmediately succeeds every cause.\r\n\r\nThe MOTIONS OF MATTER may be divided into two kinds, primary and secondary.\r\nThe secondary motions are those, which are given to or received from other\r\nmatter in motion. Their laws have been successfully investigated by\r\nphilosophers in their treatises on mechanic powers. These motions are\r\ndistinguished by this circumstance, that the velocity multiplied into the\r\nquantity of matter of the body acted upon is equal to the velocity\r\nmultiplied into the quantity of matter of the acting body.\r\n\r\nThe primary motions of matter may be divided into three classes, those\r\nbelonging to gravitation, to chemistry, and to life; and each class has its\r\npeculiar laws. Though these three classes include the motions of solid,\r\nliquid, and aerial bodies; there is nevertheless a fourth division of\r\nmotions; I mean those of the supposed ethereal fluids of magnetism,\r\nelectricity, heat, and light; whose properties are not so well investigated\r\nas to be classed with sufficient accuracy.\r\n\r\n_1st._ The gravitating motions include the annual and diurnal rotation of\r\nthe earth and planets, the flux and reflux of the ocean, the descent of\r\nheavy bodies, and other phænomena of gravitation. The unparalleled sagacity\r\nof the great NEWTON has deduced the laws of this class of motions from the\r\nsimple principle of the general attraction of matter. These motions are\r\ndistinguished by their tendency to or from the centers of the sun or\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\n_2d._ The chemical class of motions includes all the various appearances of\r\nchemistry. Many of the facts, which belong to these branches of science,\r\nare nicely ascertained, and elegantly classed; but their laws have not yet\r\nbeen developed from such simple principles as those above-mentioned; though\r\nit is probable, that they depend on the specific attractions belonging to\r\nthe particles of bodies, or to the difference of the quantity of attraction\r\nbelonging to the sides and angles of those particles. The chemical motions\r\nare distinguished by their being generally attended with an evident\r\ndecomposition or new combination of the active materials.\r\n\r\n_3d._ The third class includes all the motions of the animal and vegetable\r\nworld; as well those of the vessels, which circulate their juices, and of\r\nthe muscles, which perform their locomotion, as those of the organs of\r\nsense, which constitute their ideas.\r\n\r\nThis last class of motion is the subject of the following pages; which,\r\nthough conscious of their many imperfections, I hope may give some pleasure\r\nto the patient reader, and contribute something to the knowledge and to the\r\ncure of diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

The nervous system has its origin from the brain, and is distributed\r\nto every part of the body. Those nerves, which serve the senses,\r\nprincipally arise from that part of the brain, which is lodged in the head;\r\nand those, which serve the purposes of muscular motion, principally arise\r\nfrom that part of the brain, which is lodged in the neck and back, and\r\nwhich is erroneously called the spinal marrow. The ultimate fibrils of\r\nthese nerves terminate in the immediate organs of sense and muscular\r\nfibres, and if a ligature be put on any part of their passage from the head\r\nor spine, all motion and perception cease in the parts beneath the\r\nligature.\r\n\r\n2. The longitudinal muscular fibres compose the locomotive muscles, whose\r\ncontractions move the bones of the limbs and trunk, to which their\r\nextremities are attached. The annular or spiral muscular fibres compose the\r\nvascular muscles, which constitute the intestinal canal, the arteries,\r\nveins, glands, and absorbent vessels.\r\n\r\n3. The immediate organs of sense, as the retina of the eye, probably\r\nconsist of moving fibrils, with a power of contraction similar to that of\r\nthe larger muscles above described.\r\n\r\n4. The cellular membrane consists of cells, which resemble those of a\r\nsponge, communicating with each other, and connecting together all the\r\nother parts of the body.\r\n\r\n5. The arterial system consists of the aortal and the pulmonary artery,\r\nwhich are attended through their whole course with their correspondent\r\nveins. The pulmonary artery receives the blood from the right chamber of\r\nthe heart, and carries it to the minute extensive ramifications of the\r\nlungs, where it is exposed to the action of the air on a surface equal to\r\nthat of the whole external skin, through the thin moist coats of those\r\nvessels, which are spread on the air-cells, which constitute the minute\r\nterminal ramifications of the wind-pipe. Here the blood changes its colour\r\nfrom a dark red to a bright scarlet. It is then collected by the branches\r\nof the pulmonary vein, and conveyed to the left chamber of the heart.\r\n\r\n6. The aorta is another large artery, which receives the blood from the\r\nleft chamber of the heart, after it has been thus aerated in the lungs, and\r\nconveys it by ascending and descending branches to every other part of the\r\nsystem; the extremities of this artery terminate either in glands, as the\r\nsalivary glands, lacrymal glands, &c. or in capillary vessels, which are\r\nprobably less involuted glands; in these some fluid, as saliva, tears,\r\nperspiration, are separated from the blood; and the remainder of the blood\r\nis absorbed or drank up by branches of veins correspondent to the branches\r\nof the artery; which are furnished with valves to prevent its return; and\r\nis thus carried back, after having again changed its colour to a dark red,\r\nto the right chamber of the heart. The circulation of the blood in the\r\nliver differs from this general system; for the veins which drink up the\r\nrefluent blood from those arteries, which are spread on the bowels and\r\nmesentery, unite into a trunk in the liver, and form a kind of artery,\r\nwhich is branched into the whole substance of the liver, and is called the\r\nvena portarum; and from which the bile is separated by the numerous hepatic\r\nglands, which constitute that viscus.\r\n\r\n7. The glands may be divided into three systems, the convoluted glands,\r\nsuch as those above described, which separate bile, tears, saliva, &c.\r\nSecondly, the glands without convolution, as the capillary vessels, which\r\nunite the terminations of the arteries and veins; and separate both the\r\nmucus, which lubricates the cellular membrane, and the perspirable matter,\r\nwhich preserves the skin moist and flexible. And thirdly, the whole\r\nabsorbent system, consisting of the lacteals, which open their mouths into\r\nthe stomach and intestines, and of the lymphatics, which open their mouths\r\non the external surface of the body, and on the internal linings of all the\r\ncells of the cellular membrane, and other cavities of the body.\r\n\r\nThese lacteal and lymphatic vessels are furnished with numerous valves to\r\nprevent the return of the fluids, which they absorb, and terminate in\r\nglands, called lymphatic glands, and may hence be considered as long necks\r\nor mouths belonging to these glands. To these they convey the chyle and\r\nmucus, with a part of the perspirable matter, and atmospheric moisture; all\r\nwhich, after having passed through these glands, and having suffered some\r\nchange in them, are carried forward into the blood, and supply perpetual\r\nnourishment to the system, or replace its hourly waste.\r\n\r\n8. The stomach and intestinal canal have a constant vermicular motion,\r\nwhich carries forwards their contents, after the lacteals have drank up the\r\nchyle from them; and which is excited into action by the stimulus of the\r\naliment we swallow, but which becomes occasionally inverted or retrograde,\r\nas in vomiting, and in the iliac passion.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The word _sensorium_ in the following pages is designed to express\r\nnot only the medullary part of the brain, spinal marrow, nerves, organs of\r\nsense, and of the muscles; but also at the same time that living principle,\r\nor spirit of animation, which resides throughout the body, without being\r\ncognizable to our senses, except by its effects. The changes which\r\noccasionally take place in the sensorium, as during the exertions of\r\nvolition, or the sensations of pleasure or pain, are termed _sensorial\r\nmotions_.\r\n\r\n2. The similarity of the texture of the brain to that of the pancreas, and\r\nsome other glands of the body, has induced the inquirers into this subject\r\nto believe, that a fluid, perhaps much more subtile than the electric aura,\r\nis separated from the blood by that organ for the purposes of motion and\r\nsensation. When we recollect, that the electric fluid itself is actually\r\naccumulated and given out voluntarily by the torpedo and the gymnotus\r\nelectricus, that an electric shock will frequently stimulate into motion a\r\nparalytic limb, and lastly that it needs no perceptible tubes to convey it,\r\nthis opinion seems not without probability; and the singular figure of the\r\nbrain and nervous system seems well adapted to distribute it over every\r\npart of the body.\r\n\r\nFor the medullary substance of the brain not only occupies the cavities of\r\nthe head and spine, but passes along the innumerable ramifications of the\r\nnerves to the various muscles and organs of sense. In these it lays aside\r\nits coverings, and is intermixed with the slender fibres, which constitute\r\nthose muscles and organs of sense. Thus all these distant ramifications of\r\nthe sensorium are united at one of their extremities, that is, in the head\r\nand spine; and thus these central parts of the sensorium constitute a\r\ncommunication between all the organs of sense and muscles.\r\n\r\n3. A _nerve_ is a continuation of the medullary substance of the brain from\r\nthe head or spine towards the other parts of the body, wrapped in its\r\nproper membrane.\r\n\r\n4. The _muscular fibres_ are moving organs intermixed with that medullary\r\nsubstance, which is continued along the nerves, as mentioned above. They\r\nare indued with the power of contraction, and are again elongated either by\r\nantagonist muscles, by circulating fluids, or by elastic ligaments. So the\r\nmuscles on one side of the forearm bend the fingers by means of their\r\ntendons, and those on the other side of the fore-arm extend them again. The\r\narteries are distended by the circulating blood; and in the necks of\r\nquadrupeds there is a strong elastic ligament, which assists the muscles,\r\nwhich elevate the head, to keep it in its horizontal position, and to raise\r\nit after it has been depressed.\r\n\r\n5. The _immediate organs of sense_ consist in like manner of moving fibres\r\nenveloped in the medullary substance above mentioned; and are erroneously\r\nsupposed to be simply an expansion of the nervous medulla, as the retina of\r\nthe eye, and the rete mucosum of the skin, which are the immediate organs\r\nof vision, and of touch. Hence when we speak of the contractions of the\r\nfibrous parts of the body, we shall mean both the contractions of the\r\nmuscles, and those of the immediate organs of sense. These _fibrous\r\nmotions_ are thus distinguished from the _sensorial motions_ above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n6. The _external organs_ of sense are the coverings of the immediate organs\r\nof sense, and are mechanically adapted for the reception or transmission of\r\npeculiar bodies, or of their qualities, as the cornea and humours of the\r\neye, the tympanum of the ear, the cuticle of the fingers and tongue.\r\n\r\n7. The word _idea_ has various meanings in the writers of metaphysic: it is\r\nhere used simply for those notions of external things, which our organs of\r\nsense bring us acquainted with originally; and is defined a contraction, or\r\nmotion, or configuration, of the fibres, which constitute the immediate\r\norgan of sense; which will be explained at large in another part of the\r\nwork. Synonymous with the word idea, we shall sometimes use the words\r\n_sensual motion_ in contradistinction to _muscular motion_.\r\n\r\n8. The word _perception_ includes both the action of the organ of sense in\r\nconsequence of the impact of external objects, and our attention to that\r\naction; that is, it expresses both the motion of the organ of sense, or\r\nidea, and the pain or pleasure that succeeds or accompanies it.\r\n\r\n9. The pleasure or pain which necessarily accompanies all those perceptions\r\nor ideas which we attend to, either gradually subsides, or is succeeded by\r\nother fibrous motions. In the latter case it is termed _sensation_, as\r\nexplained in Sect. V. 2, and VI. 2.--The reader is intreated to keep this\r\nin his mind, that through all this treatise the word sensation is used to\r\nexpress pleasure or pain only in its active state, by whatever means it is\r\nintroduced into the system, without any reference to the stimulation of\r\nexternal objects.\r\n\r\n10. The vulgar use of the word _memory_ is too unlimited for our purpose:\r\nthose ideas which we voluntarily recall are here termed ideas of\r\n_recollection_, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards. And those\r\nideas which are suggested to us by preceding ideas are here termed ideas of\r\n_suggestion_, as whilst we repeat the alphabet in the usual order; when by\r\nhabits previously acquired B is suggested by A, and C by B, without any\r\neffort of deliberation.\r\n\r\n11. The word _association_ properly signifies a society or convention of\r\nthings in some respects similar to each other. We never say in common\r\nlanguage, that the effect is associated with the cause, though they\r\nnecessarily accompany or succeed each other. Thus the contractions of our\r\nmuscles and organs of sense may be said to be associated together, but\r\ncannot with propriety be said to be associated with irritations, or with\r\nvolition, or with sensation; because they are caused by them, as mentioned\r\nin Sect. IV. When fibrous contractions succeed other fibrous contractions,\r\nthe connection is termed _association_; when fibrous contractions succeed\r\nsensorial motions, the connection is termed _causation_; when fibrous and\r\nsensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other in progressive trains\r\nor tribes, it is termed _catenation_ of animal motions. All these\r\nconnections are said to be produced by _habit_; that is, by frequent\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\n12. It may be proper to observe, that by the unavoidable idiom of our\r\nlanguage the ideas of perception, of recollection, or of imagination, in\r\nthe plural number signify the ideas belonging to perception, to\r\nrecollection, or to imagination; whilst the idea of perception, of\r\nrecollection, or of imagination, in the singular number is used for what is\r\ntermed \"a reflex idea of any of those operations of the sensorium.\"\r\n\r\n13. By the word _stimulus_ is not only meant the application of external\r\nbodies to our organs of sense and muscular fibres, which excites into\r\naction the sensorial power termed irritation; but also pleasure or pain,\r\nwhen they excite into action the sensorial power termed sensation; and\r\ndesire or aversion, when they excite into action the power of volition; and\r\nlastly, the fibrous contractions which precede association; as is further\r\nexplained in Sect. XII. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

I. To demonstrate that the retina and other immediate organs of\r\nsense possess a power of motion, and that these motions constitute our\r\nideas, according to the fifth and seventh of the preceding assertions,\r\nclaims our first attention.\r\n\r\nAnimal motions are distinguished from the communicated motions, mentioned\r\nin the first section, as they have no mechanical proportion to their cause;\r\nfor the goad of a spur on the skin of a horse shall induce him to move a\r\nload of hay. They differ from the gravitating motions there mentioned as\r\nthey are exerted with equal facility in all directions, and they differ\r\nfrom the chemical class of motions, because no apparent decompositions or\r\nnew combinations are produced in the moving materials.\r\n\r\nHence, when we say animal motion is excited by irritation, we do not mean\r\nthat the motion bears any proportion to the mechanical impulse of the\r\nstimulus; nor that it is affected by the general gravitation of the two\r\nbodies; nor by their chemical properties, but solely that certain animal\r\nfibres are excited into action by something external to the moving organ.\r\n\r\nIn this sense the stimulus of the blood produces the contractions of the\r\nheart; and the substances we take into our stomach and bowels stimulate\r\nthem to perform their necessary functions. The rays of light excite the\r\nretina into animal motion by their stimulus; at the same time that those\r\nrays of light themselves are physically converged to a focus by the\r\ninactive humours of the eye. The vibrations of the air stimulate the\r\nauditory nerve into animal action; while it is probable that the tympanum\r\nof the ear at the same time undergoes a mechanical vibration.\r\n\r\nTo render this circumstance more easy to be comprehended, _motion may be\r\ndefined to be a variation of figure_; for the whole universe may be\r\nconsidered as one thing possessing a certain figure; the motions of any of\r\nits parts are a variation of this figure of the whole: this definition of\r\nmotion will be further explained in Section XIV. 2. 2. on the production of\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nNow the motions of an organ of sense are a succession of configurations of\r\nthat organ; these configurations succeed each other quicker or slower; and\r\nwhatever configuration of this organ of sense, that is, whatever portion of\r\nthe motion of it is, or has usually been, attended to, constitutes an idea.\r\nHence the configuration is not to be considered as an effect of the motion\r\nof the organ, but rather as a part or temporary termination of it; and\r\nthat, whether a pause succeeds it, or a new configuration immediately takes\r\nplace. Thus when a succession of moving objects are presented to our view,\r\nthe ideas of trumpets, horns, lords and ladies, trains and canopies, are\r\nconfigurations, that is, parts or links of the successive motions of the\r\norgan of vision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate I.]\r\n\r\nThese motions or configurations of the organs of sense differ from the\r\nsensorial motions to be described hereafter, as they appear to be simply\r\ncontractions of the fibrous extremities of those organs, and in that\r\nrespect exactly resemble the motions or contractions of the larger muscles,\r\nas appears from the following experiment. Place a circular piece of red\r\nsilk about an inch in diameter on a sheet of white paper in a strong light,\r\nas in Plate I.--look for a minute on this area, or till the eye becomes\r\nsomewhat fatigued, and then, gently closing your eyes, and shading them\r\nwith your hand, a circular green area of the same apparent diameter becomes\r\nvisible in the closed eye. This green area is the colour reverse to the red\r\narea, which had been previously inspected, as explained in the experiments\r\non ocular spectra at the end of the work, and in Botanical Garden, P. 1.\r\nadditional note, No. 1. Hence it appears, that a part of the retina, which\r\nhad been fatigued by contraction in one direction, relieves itself by\r\nexerting the antagonist fibres, and producing a contraction in an opposite\r\ndirection, as is common in the exertions of our muscles. Thus when we are\r\ntired with long action of our arms in one direction, as in holding a bridle\r\non a journey, we occasionally throw them into an opposite position to\r\nrelieve the fatigued muscles.\r\n\r\nMr. Locke has defined an idea to be \"whatever is present to the mind;\" but\r\nthis would include the exertions of volition, and the sensations of\r\npleasure and pain, as well as those operations of our system, which\r\nacquaint us with external objects; and is therefore too unlimited for our\r\npurpose. Mr. Lock seems to have fallen into a further error, by conceiving,\r\nthat the mind could form a general or abstract idea by its own operation,\r\nwhich was the copy of no particular perception; as of a triangle in\r\ngeneral, that was neither acute, obtuse, nor right angled. The ingenious\r\nDr. Berkley and Mr. Hume have demonstrated, that such general ideas have no\r\nexistence in nature, not even in the mind of their celebrated inventor. We\r\nshall therefore take for granted at present, that our recollection or\r\nimagination of external objects consists of a partial repetition of the\r\nperceptions, which were excited by those external objects, at the time we\r\nbecame acquainted with them; and that our reflex ideas of the operations of\r\nour minds are partial repetitions of those operations.\r\n\r\nII. The following article evinces that the organ of vision consists of a\r\nfibrous part as well as of the nervous medulla, like other white muscles;\r\nand hence, as it resembles the muscular parts of the body in its structure,\r\nwe may conclude, that it must resemble them in possessing a power of being\r\nexcited into animal motion.--The subsequent experiments on the optic nerve,\r\nand on the colours remaining in the eye, are copied from a paper on ocular\r\nspectra published in the seventy-sixth volume of the Philos. Trans. by Dr.\r\nR. Darwin of Shrewsbury; which, as I shall have frequent occasion to refer\r\nto, is reprinted in this work, Sect. XL. The retina of an ox's eye was\r\nsuspended in a glass of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places; the\r\nedges of these parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did not contract and\r\nbecome smooth like simple mucus, when it is distended till it breaks; which\r\nevinced that it consisted of fibres. This fibrous construction became still\r\nmore distinct to the light by adding some caustic alcali to the water; as\r\nthe adhering mucus was first eroded, and the hair-like fibres remained\r\nfloating in the vessel. Nor does the degree of transparency of the retina\r\ninvalidate this evidence of its fibrous structure, since Leeuwenhoek has\r\nshewn, that the crystalline humour itself consists of fibres. Arc. Nat. V.\r\nI. 70.\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that as the muscles consist of larger fibres intermixed\r\nwith a smaller quantity of nervous medulla, the organ of vision consists of\r\na greater quantity of nervous medulla intermixed with smaller fibres. It is\r\nprobable that the locomotive muscles of microscopic animals may have\r\ngreater tenuity than these of the retina; and there is reason to conclude\r\nfrom analogy, that the other immediate organs of sense, as the portio\r\nmollis of the auditory nerve, and the rete mucosum of the skin, possess a\r\nsimilarity of structure with the retina, and a similar power of being\r\nexcited into animal motion.\r\n\r\nIII. The subsequent articles shew, that neither mechanical impressions, nor\r\nchemical combinations of light, but that the animal activity of the retina\r\nconstitutes vision.\r\n\r\n1. Much has been conjectured by philosophers about the momentum of the rays\r\nof light; to subject this to experiment a very light horizontal balance was\r\nconstructed by Mr. Michel, with about an inch square of thin leaf-copper\r\nsuspended at each end of it, as described in Dr. Priestley's History of\r\nLight and Colours. The focus of a very large convex mirror was thrown by\r\nDr. Powel, in his lectures on experimental philosophy, in my presence, on\r\none wing of this delicate balance, and it receded from the light; thrown on\r\nthe other wing, it approached towards the light, and this repeatedly; so\r\nthat no sensible impulse could be observed, but what might well be ascribed\r\nto the ascent of heated air.\r\n\r\nWhence it is reasonable to conclude, that the light of the day must be much\r\ntoo weak in its dilute state to make any mechanical impression on so\r\ntenacious a substance as the retina of the eye.--Add to this, that as the\r\nretina is nearly transparent, it could therefore make less resistance to\r\nthe mechanical impulse of light; which, according, to the observations\r\nrelated by Mr. Melvil in the Edinburgh Literary Essays, only communicates\r\nheat, and should therefore only communicate momentum, where it is\r\nobstructed, reflected, or refracted.--From whence also may be collected the\r\nfinal cause of this degree of transparency of the retina, viz. left by the\r\nfocus of stronger lights, heat and pain should have been produced in the\r\nretina, instead of that stimulus which excites it into animal motion.\r\n\r\n2. On looking long on an area of scarlet silk of about an inch in diameter\r\nlaid on white paper, as in Plate I. the scarlet colour becomes fainter,\r\ntill at length it entirely vanishes, though the eye is kept uniformly and\r\nsteadily upon it. Now if the change or motion of the retina was a\r\nmechanical impression, or a chemical tinge of coloured light, the\r\nperception would every minute become stronger and stronger,--whereas in\r\nthis experiment it becomes every instant weaker and weaker. The same\r\ncircumstance obtains in the continued application of sound, or of sapid\r\nbodies, or of odorous ones, or of tangible ones, to their adapted organs of\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II.]\r\n\r\nThus when a circular coin, as a shilling, is pressed on the palm of the\r\nhand, the sense of touch is mechanically compressed; but it is the stimulus\r\nof this pressure that excites the organ of touch into animal action, which\r\nconstitutes the perception of hardness and of figure; for in some minutes\r\nthe perception ceases, though the mechanical pressure of the object\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n3. Make with ink on white paper a very black spot about half an inch in\r\ndiameter, with a tail about an inch in length, so as to resemble a tadpole,\r\nas in Plate II.; look steadfastly for a minute on the center of this spot,\r\nand, on moving the eye a little, the figure of the tadpole will be seen on\r\nthe white part of the paper; which figure of the tadpole will appear more\r\nluminous than the other part of the white paper; which can only be\r\nexplained by supposing that a part of the retina, on which the tadpole was\r\ndelineated, to have become more sensible to light than the other parts of\r\nit, which were exposed to the white paper; and not from any idea of\r\nmechanical impression or chemical combination of light with the retina.\r\n\r\n4. When any one turns round rapidly, till he becomes dizzy, and falls upon\r\nthe ground, the spectra of the ambient objects continue to present\r\nthemselves in rotation, and he seems to behold the objects still in motion.\r\nNow if these spectra were impressions on a passive organ, they either must\r\ncontinue as they were received last, or not continue at all.\r\n\r\n5. Place a piece of red silk about an inch in diameter on a sheet of white\r\npaper in a strong light, as in Plate I; look steadily upon it from the\r\ndistance of about half a yard for a minute; then closing your eye-lids,\r\ncover them with your hands and handkerchief, and a green spectrum will be\r\nseen in your eyes resembling in form the piece of red silk. After some\r\nseconds of time the spectrum will disappear, and in a few more seconds will\r\nreappear; and thus alternately three or four times, if the experiment be\r\nwell made, till at length it vanishes entirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III.]\r\n\r\n6. Place a circular piece of white paper, about four inches in diameter, in\r\nthe sunshine, cover the center of this with a circular piece of black silk,\r\nabout three inches in diameter; and the center of the black silk with a\r\ncircle of pink silk, about two inches in diameter; and the center of the\r\npink silk with a circle of yellow silk, about one inch in diameter; and the\r\ncenter of this with a circle of blue silk, about half an inch in diameter;\r\nmake a small spot with ink in the center of the blue silk, as in Plate\r\nIII.; look steadily for a minute on this central spot, and then closing\r\nyour eyes, and applying your hand at about an inch distance before them, so\r\nas to prevent too much or too little light from passing through the\r\neye-lids, and you will see the most beautiful circles of colours that\r\nimagination can conceive; which are most resembled by the colours\r\noccasioned by pouring a drop or two of oil on a still lake in a bright day.\r\nBut these circular irises of colours are not only different from the\r\ncolours of the silks above mentioned, but are at the same time perpetually\r\nchanging as long as they exist.\r\n\r\nFrom all these experiments it appears, that these spectra in the eye are\r\nnot owing to the mechanical impulse of light impressed on the retina; nor\r\nto its chemical combination with that organ; nor to the absorption and\r\nemission of light, as is supposed, perhaps erroneously, to take place in\r\ncalcined shells and other phosphorescent bodies, after having been exposed\r\nto the light: for in all these cases the spectra in the eye should either\r\nremain of the same colour, or gradually decay, when the object is\r\nwithdrawn; and neither their evanescence during the presence of their\r\nobject, as in the second experiment, nor their change from dark to\r\nluminous, as in the third experiment, nor their rotation, as in the fourth\r\nexperiment, nor the alternate presence and evanescence of them, as in the\r\nfifth experiment, nor the perpetual change of colours of them, as in the\r\nlast experiment, could exist.\r\n\r\nIV. The subsequent articles shew, that these animal motions or\r\nconfigurations of our organs of sense constitute our ideas.\r\n\r\n1. If any one in the dark presses the ball of his eye, by applying his\r\nfinger to the external corner of it, a luminous appearance is observed; and\r\nby a smart stroke on the eye great slashes of fire are perceived. (Newton's\r\nOptics.) So that when the arteries, that are near the auditory nerve, make\r\nstronger pulsations than usual, as in some fevers, an undulating sound is\r\nexcited in the ears. Hence it is not the presence of the light and sound,\r\nbut the motions of the organ, that are immediately necessary to constitute\r\nthe perception or idea of light and sound.\r\n\r\n2. During the time of sleep, or in delirium, the ideas of imagination are\r\nmistaken for the perceptions of external objects; whence it appears, that\r\nthese ideas of imagination, are no other than a reiteration of those\r\nmotions of the organs of sense, which were originally excited by the\r\nstimulus of external objects: and in our waking hours the simple ideas,\r\nthat we call up by recollection or by imagination, as the colour of red, or\r\nthe smell of a rose, are exact resemblances of the same simple ideas from\r\nperception; and in consequence must be a repetition of those very motions.\r\n\r\n3. The disagreeable sensation called the tooth-edge is originally excited\r\nby the painful jarring of the teeth in biting the edge of the glass, or\r\nporcelain cup, in which our food was given us in our infancy, as is further\r\nexplained in the Section XVI. 10, on Instinct.--This disagreeable sensation\r\nis afterwards excitable not only by a repetition of the sound, that was\r\nthen produced, but by imagination alone, as I have myself frequently\r\nexperienced; in this case the idea of biting a china cup, when I imagine it\r\nvery distinctly, or when I see another person bite a cup or glass, excites\r\nan actual pain in the nerves of my teeth. So that this idea and pain seem\r\nto be nothing more than the reiterated motions of those nerves, that were\r\nformerly so disagreeably affected.\r\n\r\nOther ideas that are excited by imagination or recollection in many\r\ninstances produce similar effects on the constitution, as our perceptions\r\nhad formerly produced, and are therefore undoubtedly a repetition of the\r\nsame motions. A story which the celebrated Baron Van Swieton relates of\r\nhimself is to this purpose. He was present when the putrid carcase of a\r\ndead dog exploded with prodigious stench; and some years afterwards,\r\naccidentally riding along the same road, he was thrown into the same\r\nsickness and vomiting by the idea of the stench, as he had before\r\nexperienced from the perception of it.\r\n\r\n4. Where the organ of sense is totally destroyed, the ideas which were\r\nreceived by that organ seem to perish along with it, as well as the power\r\nof perception. Of this a satisfactory instance has fallen under my\r\nobservation. A gentleman about sixty years of age had been totally deaf for\r\nnear thirty years: he appeared to be a man of good understanding, and\r\namused himself with reading, and by conversing either by the use of the\r\npen, or by signs made with his fingers, to represent letters. I observed\r\nthat he had so far forgot the pronunciation of the language, that when he\r\nattempted to speak, none of his words had distinct articulation, though his\r\nrelations could sometimes understand his meaning. But, which is much to the\r\npoint, he assured me, that in his dreams he always imagined that people\r\nconversed with him by signs or writing, and never that he heard any one\r\nspeak to him. From hence it appears, that with the perceptions of sounds he\r\nhas also lost the ideas of them; though the organs of speech still retain\r\nsomewhat of their usual habits of articulation.\r\n\r\nThis observation may throw some light on the medical treatment of deaf\r\npeople; as it may be learnt from their dreams whether the auditory nerve be\r\nparalytic, or their deafness be owing to some defect of the external organ.\r\n\r\nIt rarely happens that the immediate organ of vision is perfectly\r\ndestroyed. The most frequent causes of blindness are occasioned by defects\r\nof the external organ, as in cataracts and obfuscations of the cornea. But\r\nI have had the opportunity of conversing with two men, who had been some\r\nyears blind; one of them had a complete gutta serena, and the other had\r\nlost the whole substance of his eyes. They both told me that they did not\r\nremember to have ever dreamt of visible objects, since the total loss of\r\ntheir sight.\r\n\r\nV. Another method of discovering that our ideas are animal motions of the\r\norgans of sense, is from considering the great analogy they bear to the\r\nmotions of the larger muscles of the body. In the following articles it\r\nwill appear that they are originally excited into action by the irritation\r\nof external objects like our muscles; are associated together like our\r\nmuscular motions; act in similar time with them; are fatigued by continued\r\nexertion like them; and that the organs of sense are subject to\r\ninflammation, numbness, palsy, convulsion, and the defects of old age, in\r\nthe same manner as the muscular fibres.\r\n\r\n1. All our perceptions or ideas of external objects are universally allowed\r\nto have been originally excited by the stimulus of those external objects;\r\nand it will be shewn in a succeeding section, that it is probable that all\r\nour muscular motions, as well those that are become voluntary as those of\r\nthe heart and glandular system, were originally in like manner excited by\r\nthe stimulus of something external to the organ of motion.\r\n\r\n2. Our ideas are also associated together after their production precisely\r\nin the same manner as our muscular motions; which will likewise be fully\r\nexplained in the succeeding section.\r\n\r\n3. The time taken up in performing an idea is likewise much the same as\r\nthat taken up in performing a muscular motion. A musician can press the\r\nkeys of an harpsichord with his fingers in the order of a tune he has been\r\naccustomed to play, in as little time as he can run over those notes in his\r\nmind. So we many times in an hour cover our eye-balls with our eye-lids\r\nwithout perceiving that we are in the dark; hence the perception or idea of\r\nlight is not changed for that of darkness in so small a time as the\r\ntwinkling of an eye; so that in this case the muscular motion of the\r\neye-lid is performed quicker than the perception of light can be changed\r\nfor that of darkness.--So if a fire-stick be whirled round in the dark, a\r\nluminous circle appears to the observer; if it be whirled somewhat slower,\r\nthis circle becomes interrupted in one part; and then the time taken up in\r\nsuch a revolution of the stick is the same that the observer uses in\r\nchanging his ideas: thus the [Greek: dolikoskoton enkos] of Homer, the long\r\nshadow of the flying javelin, is elegantly designed to give us an idea of\r\nits velocity, and not of its length.\r\n\r\n4. The fatigue that follows a continued attention of the mind to one object\r\nis relieved by changing the subject of our thoughts; as the continued\r\nmovement of one limb is relieved by moving another in its stead. Whereas a\r\ndue exercise of the faculties of the mind strengthens and improves those\r\nfaculties, whether of imagination or recollection; as the exercise of our\r\nlimbs in dancing or fencing increases the strength and agility of the\r\nmuscles thus employed.\r\n\r\n5. If the muscles of any limb are inflamed, they do not move without pain;\r\nso when the retina is inflamed, its motions also are painful. Hence light\r\nis as intolerable in this kind of ophthalmia, as pressure is to the finger\r\nin the paronychia. In this disease the patients frequently dream of having\r\ntheir eyes painfully dazzled; hence the idea of strong light is painful as\r\nwell as the reality. The first of these facts evinces that our perceptions\r\nare motions of the organs of sense; and the latter, that our imaginations\r\nare also motions of the same organs.\r\n\r\n6. The organs of sense, like the moving muscles, are liable to become\r\nbenumbed, or less sensible, from compression. Thus, if any person on a\r\nlight day looks on a white wall, he may perceive the ramifications of the\r\noptic artery, at every pulsation of it, represented by darker branches on\r\nthe white wall; which is evidently owing to its compressing the retina\r\nduring the diastole of the artery. Savage Nosolog.\r\n\r\n7. The organs of sense and the moving muscles are alike liable to be\r\naffected with palsy, as in the gutta serena, and in some cases of deafness;\r\nand one side of the face has sometimes lost its power of sensation, but\r\nretained its power of motion; other parts of the body have lost their\r\nmotions but retained their sensation, as in the common hemiplagia; and in\r\nother instances both these powers have perished together.\r\n\r\n8. In some convulsive diseases a delirium or insanity supervenes, and the\r\nconvulsions cease; and conversely the convulsions shall supervene, and the\r\ndelirium cease. Of this I have been a witness many times in a day in the\r\nparoxysms of violent epilepsies; which evinces that one kind of delirium is\r\na convulsion of the organs of sense, and that our ideas are the motions of\r\nthese organs: the subsequent cases will illustrate this observation.\r\n\r\nMiss G----, a fair young lady, with light eyes and hair, was seized with\r\nmost violent convulsions of her limbs, with outrageous hiccough, and most\r\nvehement efforts to vomit: after near an hour was elapsed this tragedy\r\nceased, and a calm talkative delirium supervened for about another hour;\r\nand these relieved each other at intervals during the greatest part of\r\nthree or four days. After having carefully considered this disease, I\r\nthought the convulsions of her ideas less dangerous than those of her\r\nmuscles; and having in vain attempted to make any opiate continue in her\r\nstomach, an ounce of laudanum was rubbed along the spine of her back, and a\r\ndram of it was used as an enema; by this medicine a kind of drunken\r\ndelirium was continued many hours; and when it ceased the convulsions did\r\nnot return; and the lady continued well many years, except some lighter\r\nrelapses, which were relieved in the same manner.\r\n\r\nMiss H----, an accomplished young lady, with light eyes and hair, was\r\nseized with convulsions of her limbs, with hiccough, and efforts to vomit,\r\nmore violent than words can express; these continued near an hour, and were\r\nsucceeded with a cataleptic spasm of one arm, with the hand applied to her\r\nhead; and after about twenty minutes these spasms ceased, and a talkative\r\nreverie supervened for near an other hour, from which no violence, which it\r\nwas proper to use, could awaken her. These periods of convulsions, first of\r\nthe muscles, and then of the ideas, returned twice a day for several weeks;\r\nand were at length removed by great doses of opium, after a great variety\r\nof other medicines and applications had been in vain experienced. This lady\r\nwas subject to frequent relapses, once or twice a year for many years, and\r\nwas as frequently relieved by the same method.\r\n\r\nMiss W----, an elegant young lady, with black eyes and hair, had sometimes\r\na violent pain of her side, at other times a most painful strangury, which\r\nwere every day succeeded by delirium; which gave a temporary relief to the\r\npainful spasms. After the vain exhibition of variety of medicines and\r\napplications by different physicians, for more than a twelvemonth, she was\r\ndirected to take some doses of opium, which were gradually increased, by\r\nwhich a drunken delirium was kept up for a day or two, and the pains\r\nprevented from returning. A flesh diet, with a little wine or beer, instead\r\nof the low regimen she had previously used, in a few weeks completely\r\nestablished her health; which, except a few relapses, has continued for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n9. Lastly, as we advance in life all the parts of the body become more\r\nrigid, and are rendered less susceptible of new habits of motion, though\r\nthey retain those that were before established. This is sensibly observed\r\nby those who apply themselves late in life to music, fencing, or any of the\r\nmechanic arts. In the same manner many elderly people retain the ideas they\r\nhad learned early in life, but find great difficulty in acquiring new\r\ntrains of memory; insomuch that in extreme old age we frequently see a\r\nforgetfulness of the business of yesterday, and at the same time a\r\ncircumstantial remembrance of the amusements of their youth; till at length\r\nthe ideas of recollection and activity of the body gradually cease\r\ntogether,--such is the condition of humanity!--and nothing remains but the\r\nvital motions and sensations.\r\n\r\nVI. 1. In opposition to this doctrine of the production of our ideas, it\r\nmay be asked, if some of our ideas, like other animal motions, are\r\nvoluntary, why can we not invent new ones, that have not been received by\r\nperception? The answer will be better understood after having perused the\r\nsucceeding section, where it will be explained, that the muscular motions\r\nlikewise are originally excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the\r\nmoving organ; and that the will has only the power of repeating the motions\r\nthus excited.\r\n\r\n2. Another objector may ask, Can the motion of an organ of sense resemble\r\nan odour or a colour? To which I can only answer, that it has not been\r\ndemonstrated that any of our ideas resemble the objects that excite them;\r\nit has generally been believed that they do not; but this shall be\r\ndiscussed at large in Sect. XIV.\r\n\r\n3. There is another objection that at first view would seem less easy to\r\nsurmount. After the amputation, of a foot or a finger, it has frequently\r\nhappened, that an injury being offered to the stump of the amputated limb,\r\nwhether from cold air, too great pressure, or other accidents, the patient\r\nhas complained, of a sensation of pain in the foot or finger, that was cut\r\noff. Does not this evince that all our ideas are excited in the brain, and\r\nnot in the organs of sense? This objection is answered, by observing that\r\nour ideas of the shape, place, and solidity of our limbs, are acquired by\r\nour organs of touch and of sight, which are situated in our fingers and\r\neyes, and not by any sensations in the limb itself.\r\n\r\nIn this case the pain or sensation, which formerly has arisen in the foot\r\nor toes, and been propagated along the nerves to the central part of the\r\nsensorium, was at the same time accompanied with a visible idea of the\r\nshape and place, and with a tangible idea of the solidity of the affected\r\nlimb: now when these nerves are afterwards affected by any injury done to\r\nthe remaining stump with a similar degree or kind of pain, the ideas of the\r\nshape, place, or solidity of the lost limb, return by association; as these\r\nideas belong to the organs of sight and touch, on which they were first\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\n4. If you wonder what organs of sense can be excited into motion, when you\r\ncall up the ideas of wisdom or benevolence, which Mr. Locke has termed\r\nabstracted ideas; I ask you by what organs of sense you first became\r\nacquainted with these ideas? And the answer will be reciprocal; for it is\r\ncertain that all our ideas were originally acquired by our organs of sense;\r\nfor whatever excites our perception must be external to the organ that\r\nperceives it, and we have no other inlets to knowledge but by our\r\nperceptions: as will be further explained in Section XIV. and XV. on the\r\nProductions and Classes of Ideas.\r\n\r\nVII. If our recollection or imagination be not a repetition of animal\r\nmovements, I ask, in my turn, What is it? You tell me it consists of images\r\nor pictures of things. Where is this extensive canvas hung up? or where are\r\nthe numerous receptacles in which those are deposited? or to what else in\r\nthe animal system have they any similitude?\r\n\r\nThat pleasing picture of objects, represented in miniature on the retina of\r\nthe eye, seems to have given rise to this illusive oratory! It was forgot\r\nthat this representation belongs rather to the laws of light, than to those\r\nof life; and may with equal elegance be seen in the camera obscura as in\r\nthe eye; and that the picture vanishes for ever, when the object is\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\nLAWS OF ANIMAL CAUSATION.\r\n\r\nI. The fibres, which constitute the muscles and organs of sense, possess a\r\npower of contraction. The circumstances attending the exertion of this\r\npower of CONTRACTION constitute the laws of animal motion, as the\r\ncircumstances attending the exertion of the power of ATTRACTION constitute\r\nthe laws of motion of inanimate matter.\r\n\r\nII. The spirit of animation is the immediate cause of the contraction of\r\nanimal fibres, it resides in the brain and nerves, and is liable to general\r\nor partial diminution or accumulation.\r\n\r\nIII. The stimulus of bodies external to the moving organ is the remote\r\ncause of the original contractions of animal fibres.\r\n\r\nIV. A certain quantity of stimulus produces irritation, which is an\r\nexertion of the spirit of animation exciting the fibres into contraction.\r\n\r\nV. A certain quantity of contraction of animal fibres, if it be perceived\r\nat all, produces pleasure; a greater or less quantity of contraction, if it\r\nbe perceived at all, produces pain; these constitute sensation.\r\n\r\nVI. A certain quantity of sensation produces desire or aversion; these\r\nconstitute volition.\r\n\r\nVII. All animal motions which have occurred at the same time, or in\r\nimmediate succession, become so connected, that when one of them is\r\nreproduced, the other has a tendency to accompany or succeed it. When\r\nfibrous contractions succeed or accompany other fibrous contractions, the\r\nconnection is termed association; when fibrous contractions succeed\r\nsensorial motions, the connexion is termed causation; when fibrous and\r\nsensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other, it is termed\r\ncatenation of animal motions. All these connections are said to be produced\r\nby habit, that is, by frequent repetition. These laws of animal causation\r\nwill be evinced by numerous facts, which occur in our daily exertions; and\r\nwill afterwards be employed to explain the more recondite phænomena of the\r\nproduction, growth, diseases, and decay of the animal system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. V.\r\n\r\nOF THE FOUR FACULTIES OR MOTIONS OF THE SENSORIUM.\r\n\r\n    1. _Four sensorial powers._ 2. _Irritation, sensation, volition,\r\n    association defined._ 3. _Sensorial motions distinguished from fibrous\r\n    motions._\r\n\r\n1. The spirit of animation has four different modes of action, or in other\r\nwords the animal sensorium possesses four different faculties, which are\r\noccasionally exerted, and cause all the contractions of the fibrous parts\r\nof the body. These are the faculty of causing fibrous contractions in\r\nconsequence of the irritations excited by external bodies, in consequence\r\nof the sensations of pleasure or pain, in consequence of volition, and in\r\nconsequence of the associations of fibrous contractions with other fibrous\r\ncontractions, which precede or accompany them.\r\n\r\nThese four faculties of the sensorium during their inactive state are\r\ntermed irritability, sensibility, voluntarity, and associability; in their\r\nactive state they are termed as above, irritation, sensation, volition,\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n2. IRRITATION is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the\r\nsensorium residing in the muscles or organs of sense, in consequence of the\r\nappulses of external bodies.\r\n\r\nSENSATION is an exertion or change of the central parts of the sensorium,\r\nor of the whole of it, _beginning_ at some of those extreme parts of it,\r\nwhich reside in the muscles or organs of sense.\r\n\r\nVOLITION is an exertion or change of the central parts of the sensorium, or\r\nof the whole of it, _terminating_ in some of those extreme parts of it,\r\nwhich reside in the muscles or organs of sense.\r\n\r\nASSOCIATION is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the sensorium\r\nresiding in the muscles or organs of sense, in consequence of some\r\nantecedent or attendant fibrous contractions.\r\n\r\n3. These four faculties of the animal sensorium may at the time of their\r\nexertions be termed motions without impropriety of language; for we cannot\r\npass from a state of insensibility or inaction to a state of sensibility or\r\nof exertion without some change of the sensorium, and every change includes\r\nmotion. We shall therefore sometimes term the above described faculties\r\n_sensorial motions_ to distinguish them from _fibrous motions_; which\r\nlatter expression includes the motions of the muscles and organs of sense.\r\n\r\nThe active motions of the fibres, whether those of the muscles or organs of\r\nsense, are probably simple contractions; the fibres being again elongated\r\nby antagonist muscles, by circulating fluids, or sometimes by elastic\r\nligaments, as in the necks of quadrupeds. The sensorial motions, which\r\nconstitute the sensations of pleasure or pain, and which constitute\r\nvolition, and which cause the fibrous contractions in consequence of\r\nirritation or of association, are not here supposed to be fluctuations or\r\nrefluctuations of the spirit of animation; nor are they supposed to be\r\nvibrations or revibrations, nor condensations or equilibrations of it; but\r\nto be changes or motions of it peculiar to life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.\r\n\r\nOF THE FOUR CLASSES OF FIBROUS MOTIONS.\r\n\r\n    I. _Origin of fibrous contractions._ II. _Distribution of them into\r\n    four classes, irritative motions, sensitive motions, voluntary motions,\r\n    and associate motions, defined._\r\n\r\nI. All the fibrous contractions of animal bodies originate from the\r\nsensorium, and resolve themselves into four classes, correspondent with the\r\nfour powers or motions of the sensorium above described, and from which\r\nthey have their causation.\r\n\r\n1. These fibrous contractions were originally caused by the irritations\r\nexcited by objects, which are external to the moving organ. As the\r\npulsations of the heart are owing to the irritations excited by the\r\nstimulus of the blood; and the ideas of perception are owing to the\r\nirritations excited by external bodies.\r\n\r\n2. But as painful or pleasurable sensations frequently accompanied those\r\nirritations, by habit these fibrous contractions became causeable by the\r\nsensations, and the irritations ceased to be necessary to their production.\r\nAs the secretion of tears in grief is caused by the sensation of pain; and\r\nthe ideas of imagination, as in dreams or delirium, are excited by the\r\npleasure or pain, with which they were formerly accompanied.\r\n\r\n3. But as the efforts of the will frequently accompanied these painful or\r\npleasureable sensations, by habit the fibrous contractions became causable\r\nby volition; and both the irritations and sensations ceased to be necessary\r\nto their production. As the deliberate locomotions of the body, and the\r\nideas of recollection, as when we will to repeat the alphabet backwards.\r\n\r\n4. But as many of these fibrous contractions frequently accompanied other\r\nfibrous contractions, by habit they became causable by their associations\r\nwith them; and the irritations, sensations, and volition, ceased to be\r\nnecessary to their production. As the actions of the muscles of the lower\r\nlimbs in fencing are associated with those of the arms; and the ideas of\r\nsuggestion are associated with other ideas, which precede or accompany\r\nthem; as in repeating carelessly the alphabet in its usual order after\r\nhaving began it.\r\n\r\nII. We shall give the following names to these four classes of fibrous\r\nmotions, and subjoin their definitions.\r\n\r\n1. Irritative motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which is\r\ncaused by the appulses of external bodies, either simply subsides, or is\r\nsucceeded by sensation, or it produces fibrous motions; it is termed\r\nirritation, and irritative motions are those contractions of the muscular\r\nfibres, or of the organs of sense, that are immediately consequent to this\r\nexertion or change of the sensorium.\r\n\r\n2. Sensitive motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which\r\nconstitutes pleasure or pain, either simply subsides, or is succeeded by\r\nvolition, or it produces fibrous motions; it is termed sensation, and the\r\nsensitive motions are those contractions of the muscular fibres, or of the\r\norgans of sense, that are immediately consequent to this exertion or change\r\nof the sensorium.\r\n\r\n3. Voluntary motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which\r\nconstitutes desire or aversion, either simply subsides, or is succeeded by\r\nfibrous motions; it is then termed volition, and voluntary motions are\r\nthose contractions of the muscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, that\r\nare immediately consequent to this exertion or change of the sensorium.\r\n\r\n4. Associate motions. That exertion or change of the sensorium, which\r\naccompanies fibrous motions, either simply subsides, or is succeeded by\r\nsensation or volition, or it produces other fibrous motions; it is then\r\ntermed association, and the associate motions are those contractions of the\r\nmuscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, that are immediately consequent\r\nto this exertion or change of the sensorium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.\r\n\r\nOF IRRITATIVE MOTIONS.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Some muscular motions are excited by perpetual irritations._ 2.\r\n    _Others more frequently by sensations._ 3. _Others by volition. Case of\r\n    involuntary stretchings in paralytic limbs._ 4. _Some sensual motions\r\n    are excited by perpetual irritations._ 5. _Others more frequently by\r\n    sensation or volition._\r\n\r\n    II. 1. _Muscular motions excited by perpetual irritations occasionally\r\n    become obedient sensation and to volition._ 2. _And the sensual\r\n    motions._\r\n\r\n    III. 1. _Other muscular motions are associated with the irritative\r\n    ones._ 2. _And other ideas with irritative ones. Of letters, language,\r\n    hieroglyphics. Irritative ideas exist without our attention to them._\r\n\r\nI. 1. Many of our muscular motions are excited by perpetual irritations, as\r\nthose of the heart and arterial system by the circumfluent blood. Many\r\nother of them are excited by intermitted irritations, as those of the\r\nstomach and bowels by the aliment we swallow; of the bile-ducts by the\r\nbile; of the kidneys, pancreas, and many other glands, by the peculiar\r\nfluids they separate from the blood; and those of the lacteal and other\r\nabsorbent vessels by the chyle, lymph, and moisture of the atmosphere.\r\nThese motions are accelerated or retarded, as their correspondent\r\nirritations are increased or diminished, without our attention or\r\nconsciousness, in the same manner as the various secretions of fruit, gum,\r\nresin, wax, and, honey, are produced in the vegetable world, and as the\r\njuices of the earth and the moisture of the atmosphere are absorbed by\r\ntheir roots and foliage.\r\n\r\n2. Other muscular motions, that are most frequently connected with our\r\nsensations, as those of the sphincters of the bladder and anus, and the\r\nmusculi erectores penis, were originally excited into motion by irritation,\r\nfor young children make water, and have other evacuations without attention\r\nto these circumstances; \"et primis etiam ab incunabulis tenduntur sæpius\r\npuerorum penes, amore nondum expergefacto.\" So the nipples of young women\r\nare liable to become turgid by irritation, long before they are in a\r\nsituation to be excited by the pleasure of giving milk to the lips of a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n3. The contractions of the larger muscles of our bodies, that are most\r\nfrequently connected with volition, were originally excited into action by\r\ninternal irritations: as appears from the stretching or yawning of all\r\nanimals after long sleep. In the beginning of some fevers this irritation\r\nof the muscles produces perpetual stretching and yawning; in other periods\r\nof fever an universal restlessness arises from the same cause, the patient\r\nchanging the attitude of his body every minute. The repeated struggles of\r\nthe foetus in the uterus must be owing to this internal irritation: for the\r\nfoetus can have no other inducement to move its limbs but the tædium or\r\nirksomeness of a continued posture.\r\n\r\nThe following case evinces, that the motions of stretching the limbs after\r\na continued attitude are not always owing to the power of the will. Mr.\r\nDean, a mason, of Austry in Leicestershire, had the spine of the third\r\nvertebra of the back enlarged; in some weeks his lower extremities became\r\nfeeble, and at length quite paralytic: neither the pain of blisters, the\r\nheat of fomentations, nor the utmost efforts of the will could produce the\r\nleast motion in these limbs; yet twice or thrice a day for many months his\r\nfeet, legs, and thighs, were affected for many minutes with forceable\r\nstretchings, attended with the sensation of fatigue; and he at length\r\nrecovered the use of his limbs, though the spine continued protuberant. The\r\nsame circumstance is frequently seen in a less degree in the common\r\nhemiplagia; and when this happens, I have believed repeated and strong\r\nshocks of electricity to have been of great advantage.\r\n\r\n4. In like manner the various organs of sense are originally excited into\r\nmotion by various external stimuli adapted to this purpose, which motions\r\nare termed perceptions or ideas; and many of these motions during our\r\nwaking hours are excited by perpetual irritation, as those of the organs of\r\nhearing and of touch. The former by the constant low indistinct noises that\r\nmurmur around us, and the latter by the weight of our bodies on the parts\r\nwhich support them; and by the unceasing variations of the heat, moisture,\r\nand pressure of the atmosphere; and these sensual motions, precisely as the\r\nmuscular ones above mentioned, obey their correspondent irritations without\r\nour attention or consciousness.\r\n\r\n5. Other classes of our ideas are more frequently excited by our sensations\r\nof pleasure or pain, and others by volition: but that these have all been\r\noriginally excited by stimuli from external objects, and only vary in their\r\ncombinations or reparations, has been fully evinced by Mr. Locke: and are\r\nby him termed the ideas of perception in contradistinction to those, which\r\nhe calls the ideas of reflection.\r\n\r\nII. 1. These muscular motions, that are excited by perpetual irritation,\r\nare nevertheless occasionally excitable by the sensations of pleasure or\r\npain, or by volition; as appears by the palpitation of the heart from fear,\r\nthe increased secretion of saliva at the sight of agreeable food, and the\r\nglow on the skin of those who are ashamed. There is an instance told in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions of a man, who could for a time stop the motion\r\nof his heart when he pleased; and Mr. D. has often told me, be could so far\r\nincrease the peristaltic motion of his bowels by voluntary efforts, as to\r\nproduce an evacuation by stool at any time in half an hour.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are excited by\r\nperpetual irritation, are nevertheless occasionally excited by sensation or\r\nvolition; as in the night, when we listen under the influence of fear, or\r\nfrom voluntary attention, the motions excited in the organ of hearing by\r\nthe whispering of the air in our room, the pulsation of our own arteries,\r\nor the faint beating of a distant watch, become objects of perception.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of other motions are associated with\r\nthese muscular motions which are excited by irritation; as by the stimulus\r\nof the blood in the right chamber of the heart, the lungs are induced to\r\nexpand themselves; and the pectoral and intercostal muscles, and the\r\ndiaphragm, act at the same time by their associations with them. And when\r\nthe pharinx is irritated by agreeable food, the muscles of deglutition are\r\nbrought into action by association. Thus when a greater light falls on the\r\neye, the iris is brought into action without our attention; and the ciliary\r\nprocess, when the focus is formed before or behind the retina, by their\r\nassociations with the increased irritative motions of the organ of vision.\r\nMany common actions of life are produced in a similar manner. If a fly\r\nsettle on my forehead, whilst I am intent on my present occupation, I\r\ndislodge it with my finger, without exciting my attention or breaking the\r\ntrain of my ideas.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the irritative ideas suggest to us many other trains or\r\ntribes of ideas that are associated with them. On this kind of connection,\r\nlanguage, letters, hieroglyphics, and every kind of symbol, depend. The\r\nsymbols themselves produce irritative ideas, or sensual motions, which we\r\ndo not attend to; and other ideas, that are succeeded by sensation, are\r\nexcited by their association with them. And as these irritative ideas make\r\nup a part of the chain of our waking thoughts, introducing other ideas that\r\nengage our attention, though themselves are unattended to, we find it very\r\ndifficult to investigate by what steps many of our hourly trains of ideas\r\ngain their admittance.\r\n\r\nIt may appear paradoxical, that ideas can exist, and not be attended to;\r\nbut all our perceptions are ideas excited by irritation, and succeeded by\r\nsensation. Now when these ideas excited by irritation give us neither\r\npleasure nor pain, we cease to attend to them. Thus whilst I am walking\r\nthrough that grove before my window, I do not run against the trees or the\r\nbenches, though my thoughts are strenuously exerted on some other object.\r\nThis leads us to a distinct knowledge of irritative ideas, for the idea of\r\nthe tree or bench, which I avoid, exists on my retina, and induces by\r\nassociation the action of certain locomotive muscles; though neither itself\r\nnor the actions of those muscles engage my attention.\r\n\r\nThus whilst we are conversing on this subject, the tone, note, and\r\narticulation of every individual word forms its correspondent irritative\r\nidea on the organ of hearing; but we only attend to the associated ideas,\r\nthat are attached by habit to these irritative ones, and are succeeded by\r\nsensation; thus when we read the words \"PRINTING-PRESS\" we do not attend to\r\nthe shape, size, or existence of the letters which compose these words,\r\nthough each of them excites a correspondent irritative motion of our organ\r\nof vision, but they introduce by association our idea of the most useful of\r\nmodern inventions; the capacious reservoir of human knowledge, whose\r\nbranching streams diffuse sciences, arts, and morality, through all nations\r\nand all ages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.\r\n\r\nOF SENSITIVE MOTIONS.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Sensitive muscular motions were originally excited into action\r\n    by irritation._ 2. _And sensitive sensual motions, ideas of\r\n    imagination, dreams._ II. 1. _Sensitive muscular motions are\r\n    occasionally obedient to volition._ 2. _And sensitive sensual motions._\r\n    III. 1. _Other muscular motions are associated with the sensitive\r\n    ones._ 2. _And other sensual motions._\r\n\r\nI. 1. Many of the motions of our muscles, that are excited into action by\r\nirritation, are at the same time accompanied with painful or pleasurable\r\nsensations; and at length become by habit causable by the sensations. Thus\r\nthe motions of the sphincters of the bladder and anus were originally\r\nexcited into action by irritation; for young children give no attention to\r\nthese evacuations; but as soon as they become sensible of the inconvenience\r\nof obeying these irritations, they suffer the water or excrement to\r\naccumulate, till it disagreeably affects them; and the action of those\r\nsphincters is then in consequence of this disagreeable sensation. So the\r\nsecretion of saliva, which in young children is copiously produced by\r\nirritation, and drops from their mouths, is frequently attended with the\r\nagreeable sensation produced by the mastication of tasteful food;, till at\r\nlength the sight of such food to a hungry person excites into action these\r\nsalival glands; as is seen in the slavering of hungry dogs.\r\n\r\nThe motions of those muscles, which are affected by lascivious ideas, and\r\nthose which are exerted in smiling, weeping, starting from fear, and\r\nwinking at the approach of danger to the eye, and at times the actions of\r\nevery large muscle of the body become causable by our sensations. And all\r\nthese motions are performed with strength and velocity in proportion to the\r\nenergy of the sensation that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial\r\npower.\r\n\r\n2. Many of the motions of our organs of sense, or ideas, that were\r\noriginally excited into action by irritation, become in like manner more\r\nfrequently causable by our sensations of pleasure or pain. These motions\r\nare then termed the ideas of imagination, and make up all the scenery and\r\ntransactions of our dreams. Thus when any painful or pleasurable sensations\r\npossess us, as of love, anger, fear; whether in our sleep or waking hours,\r\nthe ideas, that have been formerly excited by the objects of these\r\nsensations, now vividly recur before us by their connection with these\r\nsensations themselves. So the fair smiling virgin, that excited your love\r\nby her presence, whenever that sensation recurs, rises before you in\r\nimagination; and that with all the pleasing circumstances, that had before\r\nengaged your attention. And in sleep, when you dream under the influence of\r\nfear, all the robbers, fires, and precipices, that you formerly have seen\r\nor heard of, arise before you with terrible vivacity. All these sensual\r\nmotions, like the muscular ones above mentioned, are performed with\r\nstrength and velocity in proportion to the energy of the sensation of\r\npleasure or pain, which excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power.\r\n\r\nII. 1. Many of these muscular motions above described, that are most\r\nfrequently excited by our sensations, are nevertheless occasionally\r\ncausable by volition; for we can smile or frown spontaneously, can make\r\nwater before the quantity or acrimony of the urine produces a disagreeable\r\nsensation, and can voluntarily masticate a nauseous drug, or swallow a\r\nbitter draught, though our sensation would strongly dissuade us.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are most frequently\r\nexcited by our sensations, are nevertheless occasionally causeable by\r\nvolition, as we can spontaneously call up our last night's dream before us,\r\ntracing it industriously step by step through all its variety of scenery\r\nand transaction; or can voluntarily examine or repeat the ideas, that have\r\nbeen excited by out disgust or admiration.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of motions are associated with these\r\nsensitive muscular motions above mentioned; as when a drop of water falling\r\ninto the wind-pipe disagreeably affects the air-vessels of the lungs, they\r\nare excited into violent action; and with these sensitive motions are\r\nassociated the actions of the pectoral and intercostal muscles, and the\r\ndiaphragm; till by their united and repeated succussions the drop is\r\nreturned through the larinx. The same occurs when any thing disagreeably\r\naffects the nostrils, or the stomach, or the uterus; variety of muscles are\r\nexcited by association into forcible action, not to be suppressed by the\r\nutmost efforts of the will; as in sneezing, vomiting, and parturition.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner with these sensitive sensual motions, or ideas of\r\nimagination, are associated many other trains or tribes of ideas, which by\r\nsome writers of metaphysics have been classed under the terms of\r\nresemblance, causation, and contiguity; and will be more fully treated of\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. IX.\r\n\r\nOF VOLUNTARY MOTIONS.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Voluntary muscular motions are originally excited by\r\n    irritations._ 2. _And voluntary ideas. Of reason._ II. 1. _Voluntary\r\n    muscular motions are occasionally causable by sensations._ 2. _And\r\n    voluntary ideas._ III. 1. _Voluntary muscular motions are occasionally\r\n    obedient to irritations._ 2. _And voluntary ideas._ IV. 1. _Voluntary\r\n    muscular motions are associated with other muscular motions._ 2. _And\r\n    voluntary ideas._\r\n\r\nWhen pleasure or pain affect the animal system, many of its motions both\r\nmuscular and sensual are brought into action; as was shewn in the preceding\r\nsection, and were called sensitive motions. The general tendency of these\r\nmotions is to arrest and to possess the pleasure, or to dislodge or avoid\r\nthe pain: but if this cannot immediately be accomplished, desire or\r\naversion are produced, and the motions in consequence of this new faculty\r\nof the sensorium are called voluntary.\r\n\r\nI. 1. Those muscles of the body that are attached to bones, have in general\r\ntheir principal connections with volition, as I move my pen or raise my\r\nbody. These motions were originally excited by irritation, as was explained\r\nin the section on that subject, afterwards the sensations of pleasure or\r\npain, that accompanied the motions thus excited, induced a repetition of\r\nthem; and at length many of them were voluntarily practised in succession\r\nor in combination for the common purposes of life, as in learning to walk,\r\nor to speak; and are performed with strength and velocity in proportion to\r\nthe energy of the volition, that excites them, and the quantity of\r\nsensorial power.\r\n\r\n2. Another great class of voluntary motions consists of the ideas of\r\nrecollection. We will to repeat a certain train of ideas, as of the\r\nalphabet backwards; and if any ideas, that do not belong to this intended\r\ntrain, intrude themselves by other connections, we will to reject them, and\r\nvoluntarily persist in the determined train. So at my approach to a house\r\nwhich I have but once visited, and that at the distance of many months, I\r\nwill to recollect the names of the numerous family I expect to see there,\r\nand I do recollect them.\r\n\r\nOn this voluntary recollection of ideas our faculty of reason depends, as\r\nit enables us to acquire an idea of the dissimilitude of any two ideas.\r\nThus if you voluntarily produce the idea of a right-angled triangle, and\r\nthen of a square; and after having excited these ideas repeatedly, you\r\nexcite the idea of their difference, which is that of another right-angled\r\ntriangle inverted over the former; you are said to reason upon this\r\nsubject, or to compare your ideas.\r\n\r\nThese ideas of recollection, like the muscular motions above mentioned,\r\nwere originally excited by the irritation of external bodies, and were\r\ntermed ideas of perception: afterwards the pleasure or pain, that\r\naccompanied these motions, induced a repetition of them in the absence of\r\nthe external body, by which they were first excited; and then they were\r\ntermed ideas of imagination. At length they become voluntarily practised in\r\nsuccession or in combination for the common purposes of life; as when we\r\nmake ourselves masters of the history of mankind, or of the sciences they\r\nhave investigated; and are then called ideas of recollection; and are\r\nperformed with strength and velocity in proportion to the energy of the\r\nvolition that excites them, and the quantity of sensorial power.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The muscular motions above described, that are most frequently\r\nobedient to the will are nevertheless occasionally causable by painful or\r\npleasurable sensation, as in the starting from fear, and the contraction of\r\nthe calf of the leg in the cramp.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the sensual motions, or ideas, that are most frequently\r\nconnected with volition, are nevertheless occasionally causable by painful\r\nor pleasurable sensation. As the histories of men, or the description of\r\nplaces, which we have voluntarily taken pains to remember, sometimes occur\r\nto us in our dreams.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. The muscular motions that are generally subservient to volition,\r\nare also occasionally causable by irritation, as in stretching the limbs\r\nafter sleep, and yawning. In this manner a contraction of the arm is\r\nproduced by passing the electric fluid from the Leyden phial along its\r\nmuscles; and that even though the limb is paralytic. The sudden motion of\r\nthe arm produces a disagreeable sensation in the joint, but the muscles\r\nseem to be brought into action simply by irritation.\r\n\r\n2. The ideas, that are generally subservient to the will, are in like\r\nmanner occasionally excited by irritation; as when we view again an object,\r\nwe have before well studied, and often recollected.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. Innumerable trains or tribes of motions are associated with these\r\nvoluntary muscular motions above mentioned; as when I will to extend my arm\r\nto a distant object, some other muscles are brought into action, and\r\npreserve the balance of my body. And when I wish to perform any steady\r\nexertion, as in threading a needle, or chopping with an ax, the pectoral\r\nmuscles are at the same time brought into action to preserve the trunk of\r\nthe body motionless, and we cease to respire for a time.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the voluntary sensual motions, or ideas of recollection,\r\nare associated with many other trains or tribes of ideas. As when I\r\nvoluntarily recollect a gothic window, that I saw some time ago, the whole\r\nfront of the cathedral occurs to me at the same time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. X.\r\n\r\nOF ASSOCIATE MOTIONS.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Many muscular motions excited by irritations in trains or tribes\r\n    become associated._ 2. _And many ideas._ II. 1. _Many sensitive\r\n    muscular motions become associated._ 2. _And many sensitive ideas._\r\n    III. 1. _Many voluntary muscular motions become associated._ 2. _And\r\n    then become obedient to sensation or irritation._ 3. _And many\r\n    voluntary ideas become associated._\r\n\r\nAll the fibrous motions, whether muscular or sensual, which are frequently\r\nbrought into action together, either in combined tribes, or in successive\r\ntrains, become so connected by habit, that when one of them is reproduced\r\nthe others have a tendency to succeed or accompany it.\r\n\r\nI. 1. Many of our muscular motions were originally excited in successive\r\ntrains, as the contractions of the auricles and of the ventricles of the\r\nheart; and others in combined tribes, as the various divisions of the\r\nmuscles which compose the calf of the leg, which were originally irritated\r\ninto synchronous action by the tædium or irksomeness of a continued\r\nposture. By frequent repetitions these motions acquire associations, which\r\ncontinue during our lives, and even after the destruction of the greatest\r\npart of the sensorium; for the heart of a viper or frog will continue to\r\npulsate long after it is taken from the body; and when it has entirely\r\nceased to move, if any part of it is goaded with a pin, the whole heart\r\nwill again renew its pulsations. This kind of connection we shall term\r\nirritative association, to distinguish it from sensitive and voluntary\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n2. In like manner many of our ideas are originally excited in tribes; as\r\nall the objects of sight, after we become so well acquainted with the laws\r\nof vision, as to distinguish figure and distance as well as colour; or in\r\ntrains, as while we pass along the objects that surround us. The tribes\r\nthus received by irritation become associated by habit, and have been\r\ntermed complex ideas by the writers of metaphysics, as this book, or that\r\norange. The trains have received no particular name, but these are alike\r\nassociations of ideas, and frequently continue during our lives. So the\r\ntaste of a pine-apple, though we eat it blindfold, recalls the colour and\r\nshape of it; and we can scarcely think on solidity without figure.\r\n\r\nII. 1. By the various efforts of our sensations to acquire or avoid their\r\nobjects, many muscles are daily brought into successive or synchronous\r\nactions; these become associated by habit, and are then excited together\r\nwith great facility, and in many instances gain indissoluble connections.\r\nSo the play of puppies and kittens is a representation of their mode of\r\nfighting or of taking their prey; and the motions of the muscles necessary\r\nfor those purposes become associated by habit, and gain a great adroitness\r\nof action by these early repetitions: so the motions of the abdominal\r\nmuscles, which were originally brought into concurrent action, with the\r\nprotrusive motion of the rectum or bladder by sensation, become so\r\nconjoined with them by habit, that they not only easily obey these\r\nsensations occasioned by the stimulus of the excrement and urine, but are\r\nbrought into violent and unrestrainable action in the strangury and\r\ntenesmus. This kind of connection we shall term sensitive association.\r\n\r\n2. So many of our ideas, that have been excited together or in succession\r\nby our sensations, gain synchronous or successive associations, that are\r\nsometimes indissoluble but with life. Hence the idea of an inhuman or\r\ndishonourable action perpetually calls up before us the idea of the wretch\r\nthat was guilty of it. And hence those unconquerable antipathies are\r\nformed, which some people have to the sight of peculiar kinds of food, of\r\nwhich in their infancy they have eaten to excess or by constraint.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. In learning any mechanic art, as music, dancing, or the use of the\r\nsword, we teach many of our muscles to act together or in succession by\r\nrepeated voluntary efforts; which by habit become formed into tribes or\r\ntrains of association, and serve all our purposes with great facility, and\r\nin some instances acquire an indissoluble union. These motions are\r\ngradually formed into a habit of acting together by a multitude of\r\nrepetitions, whilst they are yet separately causable by the will, as is\r\nevident from the long time that is taken up by children in learning to walk\r\nand to speak; and is experienced by every one, when he first attempts to\r\nskate upon the ice or to swim: these we shall term voluntary associations.\r\n\r\n2. All these muscular movements, when they are thus associated into tribes\r\nor trains, become afterwards not only obedient to volition, but to the\r\nsensations and irritations; and the same movement composes a part of many\r\ndifferent tribes or trains of motion. Thus a single muscle, when it acts in\r\nconsort with its neighbours on one side, assists to move the limb in one\r\ndirection; and in another, when, it acts with those in its neighbourhood on\r\nthe other side; and in other directions, when it acts separately or jointly\r\nwith those that lie immediately under or above it; and all these with equal\r\nfacility after their associations have been well established.\r\n\r\nThe facility, with which each muscle changes from one associated tribe to\r\nanother, and that either backwards or forwards, is well observable in the\r\nmuscles of the arm in moving the windlass of an air-pump; and the slowness\r\nof those muscular movements, that have not been associated by habit, may be\r\nexperienced by any one, who shall attempt to saw the air quick\r\nperpendicularly with one hand, and horizontally with the other at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n3. In learning every kind of science we voluntarily associate many tribes\r\nand trains of ideas, which afterwards are ready for all the purposes either\r\nof volition, sensation, or irritation; and in some instances acquire\r\nindissoluble habits of acting together, so as to affect our reasoning, and\r\ninfluence our actions. Hence the necessity of a good education.\r\n\r\nThese associate ideas are gradually formed into habits of acting together\r\nby frequent repetition, while they are yet separately obedient to the will;\r\nas is evident from the difficulty we experience in gaining so exact an idea\r\nof the front of St. Paul's church, as to be able to delineate it with\r\naccuracy, or in recollecting a poem of a few pages.\r\n\r\nAnd these ideas, thus associated into tribes, not only make up the parts of\r\nthe trains of volition, sensation, and irritation; but the same idea\r\ncomposes a part of many different tribes and trains of ideas. So the simple\r\nidea of whiteness composes a part of the complex idea of snow, milk, ivory;\r\nand the complex idea of the letter A composes a part of the several\r\nassociated trains of ideas that make up the variety of words, in which this\r\nletter enters.\r\n\r\nThe numerous trains of these associated ideas are divided by Mr. Hume into\r\nthree classes, which he has termed contiguity, causation, and resemblance.\r\nNor should we wonder to find them thus connected together, since it is the\r\nbusiness of our lives to dispose them into those three classes; and we\r\nbecome valuable to ourselves and our friends, as we succeed in it. Those\r\nwho have combined an extensive class of ideas by the contiguity of time or\r\nplace, are men learned in the history of mankind, and of the sciences they\r\nhave cultivated. Those who have connected a great class of ideas of\r\nresemblances, possess the source of the ornaments of poetry and oratory,\r\nand of all rational analogy. While those who have connected great classes\r\nof ideas of causation, are furnished with the powers of producing effects.\r\nThese are the men of active wisdom, who lead armies to victory, and\r\nkingdoms to prosperity; or discover and improve the sciences, which\r\nmeliorate and adorn the condition of humanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XI.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SENSORIAL POWERS.\r\n\r\n    I. _Stimulation is of various kinds adapted to the organs of sense, to\r\n    the muscles, to hollow membranes, and glands. Some objects irritate our\r\n    senses by repeated impulses._ II. 1. _Sensation and volition frequently\r\n    affect the whole sensorium._ 2. _Emotions, passions, appetites._ 3.\r\n    _Origin of desire and aversion. Criterion of voluntary actions,\r\n    difference of brutes and men._ 4. _Sensibility and voluntarity._ III.\r\n    _Associations formed before nativity, irritative motions mistaken for\r\n    officiated ones._\r\n\r\n_Irritation._\r\n\r\nI. The various organs of sense require various kinds of stimulation to\r\nexcite them into action; the particles of light penetrate the cornea and\r\nhumours of the eye, and then irritate the naked retina; rapid particles,\r\ndissolved or diffused in water or saliva, and odorous ones, mixed or\r\ncombined with the air, irritate the extremities of the nerves of taste and\r\nsmell; which either penetrate, or are expanded on the membranes of the\r\ntongue and nostrils; the auditory nerves are stimulated by the vibrations\r\nof the atmosphere communicated by means of the tympanum and of the fluid,\r\nwhether of air or of water, behind it; and the nerves of touch by the\r\nhardness of surrounding bodies, though the cuticle is interposed between\r\nthese bodies and the medulla of the nerve.\r\n\r\nAs the nerves of the senses have each their appropriated objects, which\r\nstimulate them into activity; so the muscular fibres, which are the\r\nterminations of other sets of nerves, have their peculiar objects, which\r\nexcite them into action; the longitudinal muscles are stimulated into\r\ncontraction by extension, whence the stretching or pandiculation after a\r\nlong continued posture, during which they have been kept in a state of\r\nextension; and the hollow muscles are excited into action by distention, as\r\nthose of the rectum and bladder are induced to protrude their contents from\r\ntheir sense of the distention rather than of the acrimony of those\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nThere are other objects adapted to stimulate the nerves, which terminate in\r\nvariety of membranes, and those especially which form the terminations of\r\ncanals; thus the preparations of mercury particularly affect the salivary\r\nglands, ipecacuanha the stomach, aloe the sphincter of the anus,\r\ncantharides that of the bladder, and lastly every gland of the body appears\r\nto be indued with a kind of taste, by which it selects or forms each its\r\npeculiar fluid from the blood; and by which it is irritated into activity.\r\n\r\nMany of these external properties of bodies, which stimulate our organs of\r\nsense, do not seem to effect this by a single impulse, but by repeated\r\nimpulses; as the nerve of the ear is probably not excitable by a single\r\nvibration of air, nor the optic nerve by a single particle of light; which\r\ncircumstance produces some analogy between those two senses, at the same\r\ntime the solidity of bodies is perceived by a single application of a solid\r\nbody to the nerves of touch, and that even through the cuticle; and we are\r\nprobably possessed of a peculiar sense to distinguish the nice degrees of\r\nheat and cold.\r\n\r\nThe senses of touch and of hearing acquaint us with the mechanical impact\r\nand vibration of bodies, those of smell and taste seem to acquaint us with\r\nsome of their chemical properties, while the sense of vision and of heat\r\nacquaint us with the existence of their peculiar fluids.\r\n\r\n_Sensation and Volition._\r\n\r\nII. Many motions are produced by pleasure or pain, and that even in\r\ncontradiction to the power of volition, as in laughing, or in the\r\nstrangury; but as no name has been given to pleasure or pain, at the time\r\nit is exerted so as to cause fibrous motions, we have used the term\r\nsensation for this purpose; and mean it to bear the same analogy to\r\npleasure and pain, that the word volition does to desire and aversion.\r\n\r\n1. It was mentioned in the fifth Section, that, what we have termed\r\nsensation is a motion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium,\r\n_beginning_ at some of the extremities of it. This appears first, because\r\nour pains and pleasures are always caused by our ideas or muscular motions,\r\nwhich are the motions of the extremities of the sensorium. And, secondly,\r\nbecause the sensation of pleasure or pain frequently continues some time\r\nafter the ideas or muscular motions which excited it have ceased: for we\r\noften feel a glow of pleasure from an agreeable reverie, for many minutes\r\nafter the ideas, that were the subject of it, have escaped our memory; and\r\nfrequently experience a dejection of spirits without being able to assign\r\nthe cause of it but by much recollection.\r\n\r\nWhen the sensorial faculty of desire or aversion is exerted so as to cause\r\nfibrous motions, it is termed volition; which is said in Sect. V. to be a\r\nmotion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, _terminating_ in\r\nsome of the extremities of it. This appears, first, because our desires and\r\naversions always terminate in recollecting and comparing our ideas, or in\r\nexerting our muscles; which are the motions of the extremities of the\r\nsensorium. And, secondly, because desire or aversion begins, and frequently\r\ncontinues for a time in the central parts of the sensorium, before it is\r\npeculiarly exerted at the extremities of it; for we sometimes feel desire\r\nor aversion without immediately knowing their objects, and in consequence\r\nwithout immediately exerting any of our muscular or sensual motions to\r\nattain them: as in the beginning of the passion of love, and perhaps of\r\nhunger, or in the ennui of indolent people.\r\n\r\nThough sensation and volition begin or terminate at the extremities or\r\ncentral parts of the sensorium, yet the whole of it is frequently\r\ninfluenced by the exertion of these faculties, as appears from their\r\neffects on the external habit: for the whole skin is reddened by shame, and\r\nan universal trembling is produced by fear: and every muscle of the body is\r\nagitated in angry people by the desire of revenge.\r\n\r\nThere is another very curious circumstance, which shews that sensation and\r\nvolition are movements of the sensorium in contrary directions; that is,\r\nthat volition begins at the central parts of it, and proceeds to the\r\nextremities; and that sensation begins at the extremities, and proceeds to\r\nthe central parts: I mean that these two sensorial faculties cannot be\r\nstrongly exerted at the same time; for when we exert our volition strongly,\r\nwe do not attend to pleasure or pain; and conversely, when we are strongly\r\naffected with the sensation of pleasure or pain, we use no volition. As\r\nwill be further explained in Section XVIII. on sleep, and Section XXXIV. on\r\nvolition.\r\n\r\n2. All our emotions and passions seem to arise out of the exertions of\r\nthese two faculties of the animal sensorium. Pride, hope, joy, are the\r\nnames of particular pleasures: shame, despair, sorrow, are the names of\r\npeculiar pains: and love, ambition, avarice, of particular desires: hatred,\r\ndisgust, fear, anxiety, of particular aversions. Whilst the passion of\r\nanger includes the pain from a recent injury, and the aversion to the\r\nadversary that occasioned it. And compassion is the pain we experience at\r\nthe sight of misery, and the desire of relieving it.\r\n\r\nThere is another tribe of desires, which are commonly termed appetites, and\r\nare the immediate consequences of the absence of some irritative motions.\r\nThose, which arise from defect of internal irritations, have proper names\r\nconferred upon them, as hunger, thirst, lust, and the desire of air, when\r\nour respiration is impaired by noxious vapours; and of warmth, when we are\r\nexposed to too great a degree of cold. But those, whose stimuli are\r\nexternal to the body, are named from the objects, which are by nature\r\nconstituted to excite them; these desires originate from our past\r\nexperience of the pleasurable sensations they occasion, as the smell of an\r\nhyacinth, or the taste of a pine-apple.\r\n\r\nWhence it appears, that our pleasures and pains are at least as various and\r\nas numerous as our irritations; and that our desires and aversions must be\r\nas numerous as our pleasures and pains. And that as sensation is here used\r\nas a general term for our numerous pleasures and pains, when they produce\r\nthe contractions of our fibres; so volition is the general name for our\r\ndesires and aversions, when they produce fibrous contractions. Thus when a\r\nmotion of the central parts, or of the whole sensorium, terminates in the\r\nexertion of our muscles, it is generally called voluntary action; when it\r\nterminates in the exertion of our ideas, it is termed recollection,\r\nreasoning, determining.\r\n\r\n3. As the sensations of pleasure and pain are originally introduced by the\r\nirritations of external objects: so our desires and aversions are\r\noriginally introduced by those sensations; for when the objects of our\r\npleasures or pains are at a distance, and we cannot instantaneously possess\r\nthe one, or avoid the other, then desire or aversion is produced, and a\r\nvoluntary exertion of our ideas or muscles succeeds.\r\n\r\nThe pain of hunger excites you to look out for food, the tree, that shades\r\nyou, presents its odoriferous fruit before your eyes, you approach, pluck,\r\nand eat.\r\n\r\nThe various movements of walking to the tree, gathering the fruit, and\r\nmasticating it, are associated motions introduced by their connection with\r\nsensation; but if from the uncommon height of the tree, the fruit be\r\ninaccessible, and you are prevented from quickly possessing the intended\r\npleasure, desire is produced. The consequence of this desire is, first, a\r\ndeliberation about the means to gain the object of pleasure in process of\r\ntime, as it cannot be procured immediately; and, secondly, the muscular\r\naction necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nYou voluntarily call up all your ideas of causation, that are related to\r\nthe effect you desire, and voluntarily examine and compare them, and at\r\nlength determine whether to ascend the tree, or to gather stones from the\r\nneighbouring brook, is easier to practise, or more promising of success;\r\nand, finally, you gather the stones, and repeatedly fling them to dislodge\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\nHence then we gain a criterion to distinguish voluntary acts or thoughts\r\nfrom those caused by sensation. As the former are always employed about the\r\n_means_ to acquire pleasurable objects, or the _means_ to avoid painful\r\nones; while the latter are employed in the possession of those, which are\r\nalready in our power.\r\n\r\nHence the activity of this power of volition produces the great difference\r\nbetween the human and the brute creation. The ideas and the actions of\r\nbrutes are almost perpetually employed about their present pleasures, or\r\ntheir present pains; and, except in the few instances which are mentioned\r\nin Section XVI, on instinct, they seldom busy themselves about the means of\r\nprocuring future bliss, or of avoiding future misery; so that the acquiring\r\nof languages, the making of tools, and labouring for money, which are all\r\nonly the means to procure pleasures; and the praying to the Deity, as\r\nanother means to procure happiness, are characteristic of human nature.\r\n\r\n4. As there are many diseases produced by the quantity of the sensation of\r\npain or pleasure being too great or too little; so are there diseases\r\nproduced by the susceptibility of the constitution to motions causable by\r\nthese sensations being too dull or too vivid. This susceptibility of the\r\nsystem to sensitive motions is termed sensibility, to distinguish it from\r\nsensation, which is the actual existence or exertion of pain or pleasure.\r\n\r\nOther classes of diseases are owing to the excessive promptitude, or\r\nsluggishness of the constitution to voluntary exertions, as well as to the\r\nquantity of desire or of aversion. This susceptibility of the system to\r\nvoluntary motions is termed voluntarity, to distinguish it from volition,\r\nwhich is the exertion of desire or aversion; these diseases will be treated\r\nof at length in the progress of the work.\r\n\r\n_Association._\r\n\r\nIII. 1. It is not easy to assign a cause, why those animal movements, that\r\nhave once occurred in succession, or in combination, should afterwards have\r\na tendency to succeed or accompany each other. It is a property of\r\nanimation, and distinguishes this order of being from the other productions\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\nWhen a child first wrote the word man, it was distinguished in his mind\r\ninto three letters, and those letters into many parts of letters; but by\r\nrepeated use the word man becomes to his hand in writing it, as to his\r\norgans of speech in pronouncing it, but one movement without any\r\ndeliberation, or sensation, or irritation, interposed between the parts of\r\nit. And as many separate motions of our muscles thus become united, and\r\nform, as it were, one motion; so each separate motion before such union may\r\nbe conceived to consist of many parts or spaces moved through; and perhaps\r\neven the individual fibres of our muscles have thus gradually been brought\r\nto act in concert, which habits began to be acquired as early as the very\r\nformation of the moving organs, long before the nativity of the animal; as\r\nexplained in the Section XVI. 2. on instinct.\r\n\r\n2. There are many motions of the body, belonging to the irritative class,\r\nwhich might by a hasty observer be mistaken for associated ones; as the\r\nperistaltic motion of the stomach and intestines, and the contractions of\r\nthe heart and arteries, might be supposed to be associated with the\r\nirritative motions of their nerves of sense, rather than to be excited by\r\nthe irritation of their muscular fibres by the distention, acrimony, or\r\nmomentum of the blood. So the distention or elongation of muscles by\r\nobjects external to them irritates them into contraction, though the\r\ncuticle or other parts may intervene between the stimulating body and the\r\ncontracting muscle. Thus a horse voids his excrement when its weight or\r\nbulk irritates the rectum or sphincter ani. These muscles act from the\r\nirritation of distention, when he excludes his excrement, but the muscles\r\nof the abdomen and diaphragm are brought into motion by association with\r\nthose of the sphincter and rectum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XII.\r\n\r\nOF STIMULUS, SENSORIAL EXERTION, AND FIBROUS CONTRACTION.\r\n\r\n    I. Of fibrous contraction. 1. _Two particles of a fibre cannot approach\r\n    without the intervention of something, as in magnetism, electricity,\r\n    elasticity. Spirit of life is not electric ether. Galvani's\r\n    experiments._ 2. _Contraction of a fibre._ 3. _Relaxation succeeds._ 4.\r\n    _Successive contractions, with intervals. Quick pulse from debility,\r\n    from paucity of blood. Weak contractions performed in less time, and\r\n    with shorter intervals._ 5. _Last situation of the fibres continues\r\n    after contraction._ 6. _Contraction greater than usual induces pleasure\r\n    or pain._ 7. _Mobility of the fibres uniform. Quantity of sensorial\r\n    power fluctuates. Constitutes excitability._ II. Of sensorial exertion.\r\n    1. _Animal motion includes stimulus, sensorial power, and contractile\r\n    fibres. The sensorial faculties act separately or conjointly. Stimulus\r\n    of four kinds. Strength and weakness defined. Sensorial power\r\n    perpetually exhausted and renewed. Weakness from defect of stimulus.\r\n    From defect of sensorial power, the direct and indirect debility of Dr.\r\n    Brown. Why we become warm in Buxton bath after a time, and see well\r\n    after a time in a darkish room. Fibres may act violently, or with their\r\n    whole force, and yet feebly. Great exertion in inflammation explained.\r\n    Great muscular force of some insane people._ 2. _Occasional\r\n    accumulation of sensorial power in muscles subject to constant\r\n    stimulus. In animals sleeping in winter. In eggs, seeds, schirrous\r\n    tumours, tendons, bones._ 3. _Great exertion introduces pleasure or\r\n    pain. Inflammation. Libration of the system between torpor and\r\n    activity. Fever-fits._ 4. _Desire and aversion introduced. Excess of\r\n    volition cures fevers._ III. Of repeated stimulus. 1. _A stimulus\r\n    repeated too frequently looses effect. As opium, wine, grief. Hence old\r\n    age. Opium and aloes in small doses._ 2. _A stimulus not repeated too\r\n    frequently does not lose effect. Perpetual movement of the vital\r\n    organs._ 3. _A stimulus repeated at uniform times produces greater\r\n    effect. Irritation combined with association._ 4. _A stimulus repeated\r\n    frequently and uniformly may be withdrawn, and the action of the organ\r\n    will continue. Hence the bark cures agues, and strengthens weak\r\n    constitutions._ 5. _Defect of stimulus repeated at certain intervals\r\n    causes fever-fits._ 6. _Stimulus long applied ceases to act a second\r\n    time._ 7. _If a stimulus excites sensation in an organ not usually\r\n    excited into sensation, inflammation is produced._ IV. Of stimulus\r\n    greater than natural. 1. _A stimulus greater than natural diminishes\r\n    the quantity of sensorial power in general._ 2. _In particular organs._\r\n    3. _Induces the organ into spasmodic actions._ 4. _Induces the\r\n    antagonist fibres into action._ 5. _Induces the organ into convulsive\r\n    or fixed spasms._ 6. _Produces paralysis of the organ._ V. Of stimulus\r\n    less than natural. 1. _Stimulus less than natural occasions\r\n    accumulation of sensorial power in general._ 2. _In particular organs,\r\n    flushing of the face in a frosty morning. In fibres subject to\r\n    perpetual stimulus only. Quantity of sensorial power inversely as the\r\n    stimulus._ 3. _Induces pain. As of cold, hunger, head-ach._ 4. _Induces\r\n    more feeble and frequent contraction. As in low fevers. Which are\r\n    frequently owing to deficiency of sensorial power rather than to\r\n    deficiency of stimulus._ 5. _Inverts successive trains of motion.\r\n    Inverts ideas._ 6. _Induces paralysis and death._ VI.

Opium and warm bath relieve\r\n    pains both from defect and from excess of stimulus._ 5. _First increase\r\n    the stimulus above, and then decrease it beneath the natural quantity._\r\n    VII. Cure of decreased exertion. 1. _Natural cure by accumulation of\r\n    sensorial power. Ague-fits. Syncope._ 2. _Increase the stimulation, by\r\n    wine, opium, given so as not to intoxicate.

Blisters\r\n    of use in heart-burn, and cold extremities._ 5. _Decrease the\r\n    stimulation for a time, cold bath._ 6. _Decrease the stimulation below\r\n    natural, and then increase it above natural. Bark after emetics. Opium\r\n    after venesection. Practice of Sydenham in chlorosis._ 7. _Prevent\r\n    unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. Decumbent posture, silence,\r\n    darkness. Pulse quickened by rising out of bed._ 8. _To the greatest\r\n    degree of quiescence apply the least stimulus. Otherwise paralysis or\r\n    inflammation of the organ ensues. Gin, wine, blisters, destroy by too\r\n    great stimulation in fevers with debility. Intoxication in the\r\n    slightest degree succeeded by debility. Golden rule for determining the\r\n    best degree of stimulus in low fevers. Another golden rule for\r\n    determining the quantity of spirit which those, who are debilitated by\r\n    drinking it, may safely omit._\r\n\r\nI. _Of fibrous contraction._\r\n\r\n1. If two particles of iron lie near each other without motion, and\r\nafterwards approach each other; it is reasonable to conclude that something\r\nbesides the iron particles is the cause of their approximation; this\r\ninvisible something is termed magnetism. In the same manner, if the\r\nparticles, which compose an animal muscle, do not touch each other in the\r\nrelaxed state of the muscle, and are brought into contact during the\r\ncontraction of the muscle, it is reasonable to conclude, that some other\r\nagent is the cause of this new approximation. For nothing can act, where it\r\ndoes not exist; for to act includes to exist; and therefore the particles\r\nof the muscular fibre (which in its state of relaxation are supposed not to\r\ntouch) cannot affect each other without the influence of some intermediate\r\nagent; this agent is here termed the spirit of animation, or sensorial\r\npower, but may with equal propriety be termed the power, which causes\r\ncontraction; or may be called by any other name, which the reader may\r\nchoose to affix to it.\r\n\r\nThe contraction of a muscular fibre may be compared to the following\r\nelectric experiment, which is here mentioned not as a philosophical\r\nanalogy, but as an illustration or simile to facilitate the conception of a\r\ndifficult subject. Let twenty very small Leyden phials properly coated be\r\nhung in a row by fine silk threads at a small distance from each other; let\r\nthe internal charge of one phial be positive, and of the other negative\r\nalternately, if a communication be made from the internal surface of the\r\nfirst to the external surface of the last in the row, they will all of them\r\ninstantly approach each other, and thus shorten a line that might connect\r\nthem like a muscular fibre. See Botanic Garden, p. 1. Canto I. 1. 202, note\r\non Gymnotus.\r\n\r\nThe attractions of electricity or of magnetism do not apply philosophically\r\nto the illustration of the contraction of animal fibres, since the force of\r\nthose attractions increases in some proportion inversely as the distance,\r\nbut in muscular motion there appears no difference in velocity or strength\r\nduring the beginning or end of the contraction, but what may be clearly\r\nascribed to the varying mechanic advantage in the approximation of one bone\r\nto another. Nor can muscular motion be assimilated with greater\r\nplausibility to the attraction of cohesion or elasticity; for in bending a\r\nsteel spring, as a small sword, a less force is required to bend it the\r\nfirst inch than the second; and the second than the third; the particles of\r\nsteel on the convex side of the bent spring endeavouring to restore\r\nthemselves more powerfully the further they are drawn from each other. See\r\nBotanic Garden, P. I. addit. Note XVIII.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this may be explained another way, by supposing the\r\nelasticity of the spring to depend more on the compression of the particles\r\non the concave side than on the extension of them on the convex side; and\r\nby supposing the elasticity of the elastic gum to depend more on the\r\nresistance to the lateral compression of its particles than to the\r\nlongitudinal extension of them. Nevertheless in muscular contraction, as\r\nabove observed, there appears no difference in the velocity or force of it\r\nat its commencement or at its termination; from whence we must conclude\r\nthat animal contraction is governed by laws of its own, and not by those of\r\nmechanics, chemistry, magnetism, or electricity.\r\n\r\nOn these accounts I do not think the experiments conclusive, which were\r\nlately published by Galvani, Volta, and others, to shew a similitude\r\nbetween the spirit of animation, which contracts the muscular fibres, and\r\nthe electric fluid. Since the electric fluid may act only as a more potent\r\nstimulus exciting the muscular fibres into action, and not by supplying\r\nthem with a new quantity of the spirit of life. Thus in a recent hemiplegia\r\nI have frequently observed, when the patient yawned and stretched himself,\r\nthat the paralytic limbs moved also, though they were totally disobedient\r\nto the will. And when he was electrified by passing shocks from the\r\naffected hand to the affected foot, a motion of the paralytic limbs was\r\nalso produced. Now as in the act of yawning the muscles of the paralytic\r\nlimbs were excited into action by the stimulus of the irksomeness of a\r\ncontinued posture, and not by any additional quantity of the spirit of\r\nlife; so we may conclude, that the passage of the electric fluid, which\r\nproduced a similar effect, acted only as a stimulus, and not by supplying\r\nany addition of sensorial power.\r\n\r\nIf nevertheless this theory should ever become established, a stimulus must\r\nbe called an eductor of vital ether; which stimulus may consist of\r\nsensation or volition, as in the electric eel, as well as in the appulses\r\nof external bodies; and by drawing off the charges of vital fluid may\r\noccasion the contraction or motions of the muscular fibres, and organs of\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n2. The immediate effect of the action of the spirit of animation or\r\nsensorial power on the fibrous parts of the body, whether it acts in the\r\nmode of irritation, sensation, volition, or association, is a contraction\r\nof the animal fibre, according to the second law of animal causation. Sect.\r\nIV. Thus the stimulus of the blood induces the contraction of the heart;\r\nthe agreeable taste of a strawberry produces the contraction of the muscles\r\nof deglutition; the effort of the will contracts the muscles, which move\r\nthe limbs in walking; and by association other muscles of the trunk are\r\nbrought into contraction to preserve the balance of the body. The fibrous\r\nextremities of the organs of sense have been shewn, by the ocular spectra\r\nin Sect. III. to suffer similar contraction by each of the above modes of\r\nexcitation; and by their configurations to constitute our ideas.\r\n\r\n3. After animal fibres have for some time been excited into contraction, a\r\nrelaxation succeeds, even though the exciting cause continues to act. In\r\nrespect to the irritative motions this is exemplified in the peristaltic\r\ncontractions of the bowels; which cease and are renewed alternately, though\r\nthe stimulus of the aliment continues to be uniformly applied; in the\r\nsensitive motions, as in strangury, tenesmus, and parturition, the\r\nalternate contractions and relaxations of the muscles exist, though the\r\nstimulus is perpetual. In our voluntary exertions it is experienced, as no\r\none can hang long by the hands, however vehemently he wills so to do; and\r\nin the associate motions the constant change of our attitudes evinces the\r\nnecessity of relaxation to those muscles, which have been long in action.\r\n\r\nThis relaxation of a muscle after its contraction, even though the stimulus\r\ncontinues to be applied, appears to arise from the expenditure or\r\ndiminution of the spirit of animation previously resident in the muscle,\r\naccording to the second law of animal causation in Sect. IV. In those\r\nconstitutions, which are termed weak, the spirit of animation becomes\r\nsooner exhausted, and tremulous motions are produced, as in the hands of\r\ninfirm people, when they lift a cup to their mouths. This quicker\r\nexhaustion of the spirit of animation is probably owing to a less quantity\r\nof it residing in the acting fibres, which therefore more frequently\r\nrequire a supply from the nerves, which belong to them.\r\n\r\n4. If the sensorial power continues to act, whether it acts in the mode of\r\nirritation, sensation, volition, or association, a new contraction of the\r\nanimal fibre succeeds after a certain interval; which interval is of\r\nshorter continuance in weak people than in strong ones. This is exemplified\r\nin the shaking of the hands of weak people, when they attempt to write. In\r\na manuscript epistle of one of my correspondents, which is written in a\r\nsmall hand, I observed from four to six zigzags in the perpendicular stroke\r\nof every letter, which shews that both the contractions of the fingers, and\r\nintervals between them, must have been performed in very short periods of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe times of contraction of the muscles of enfeebled people being less, and\r\nthe intervals between those contractions being less also, accounts for the\r\nquick pulse in fevers with debility, and in dying animals. The shortness of\r\nthe intervals between one contraction and another in weak constitutions, is\r\nprobably owing to the general deficiency of the quantity of the spirit of\r\nanimation, and that therefore there is a less quantity of it to be received\r\nat each interval of the activity of the fibres. Hence in repeated motions,\r\nas of the fingers in performing on the harpsichord, it would at first sight\r\nappear, that swiftness and strength were incompatible; nevertheless the\r\nsingle contraction of a muscle is performed with greater velocity as well\r\nas with greater force by vigorous constitutions, as in throwing a javelin.\r\n\r\nThere is however another circumstance, which may often contribute to cause\r\nthe quickness of the pulse in nervous fevers, as in animals bleeding to\r\ndeath in the slaughter-house; which is the deficient quantity of blood;\r\nwhence the heart is but half distended, and in consequence sooner\r\ncontracts. See Sect. XXXII. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nFor we must not confound frequency of repetition with quickness of motion,\r\nor the number of pulsations with the velocity, with which the fibres, which\r\nconstitute the coats of the arteries, contract themselves. For where the\r\nfrequency of the pulsations is but seventy-five in a minute, as in health;\r\nthe contracting fibres, which constitute the sides of the arteries, may\r\nmove through a greater space in a given time, than where the frequency of\r\npulsation is one hundred and fifty in a minute, as in some fevers with\r\ngreat debility. For if in those fevers the arteries do not expand\r\nthemselves in their diastole to more than half the usual diameter of their\r\ndiastole in health, the fibres which constitute their coats, will move\r\nthrough a less space in a minute than in health, though they make two\r\npulsations for one.\r\n\r\nSuppose the diameter of the artery during its systole to be one line, and\r\nthat the diameter of the same artery during its diastole is in health is\r\nfour lines, and in a fever with, great debility only two lines. It follows,\r\nthat the arterial fibres contract in health from a circle of twelve lines\r\nin circumference to a circle of three lines in circumference, that is they\r\nmove through a space of nine lines in length. While the arterial fibres in\r\nthe fever with debility would twice contract from a circle of six lines to\r\na circle of three lines; that is while they move through a space equal to\r\nsix lines. Hence though the frequency of pulsation in fever be greater as\r\ntwo to one, yet the velocity of contraction in health is greater as nine to\r\nsix, or as three to two.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary in inflammatory diseases with strength, as in the pleurisy,\r\nthe velocity of the contracting sides of the arteries is much greater than\r\nin health, for if we suppose the number of pulsations in a pleurisy to be\r\nhalf as much more than in health, that is as one hundred and twenty to\r\neighty, (which is about what generally happens in inflammatory diseases)\r\nand if the diameter of the artery in diastole be one third greater than in\r\nhealth, which I believe is near the truth, the result will be, that the\r\nvelocity of the contractile sides of the arteries will be in a pleurisy as\r\ntwo and a half to one, compared to the velocity of their contraction in a\r\nstate of health, for if the circumference of the systole of the artery be\r\nthree lines, and the diastole in health be twelve lines in circumference,\r\nand in a pleurisy eighteen lines; and secondly, if the artery pulsates\r\nthrice in the diseased state for twice in the healthy one, it follows, that\r\nthe velocity of contraction in the diseased state to that in the healthy\r\nstate will be forty-five to eighteen, or as two and a half to one.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it would appear, that if we had a criterion to determine the\r\nvelocity of the arterial contractions, it would at the same time give us\r\ntheir strength, and thus be of more service in distinguishing diseases,\r\nthan the knowledge of their frequency. As such a criterion cannot be had,\r\nthe frequency of pulsation, the age of the patient being allowed for, will\r\nin some measure assist us to distinguish arterial strength from arterial\r\ndebility, since in inflammatory diseases with strength the frequency seldom\r\nexceeds one hundred and eighteen or one hundred and twenty pulsations in a\r\nminute; unless under peculiar circumstance, as the great additional stimuli\r\nof wine or of external heat.\r\n\r\n5. After a muscle or organ of sense has been excited into contraction, and\r\nthe sensorial power ceases to act, the last situation or configuration of\r\nit continues; unless it be disturbed by the action of some antagonist\r\nfibres, or other extraneous power. Thus in weak or languid people, wherever\r\nthey throw their limbs on their bed or sofa, there they lie, till another\r\nexertion changes their attitude; hence one kind of ocular spectra seems to\r\nbe produced after looking at bright objects; thus when a fire-stick is\r\nwhirled round in the night, there appears in the eye a complete circle of\r\nfire; the action or configuration of one part of the retina not ceasing\r\nbefore the return of the whirling fire.\r\n\r\nThus if any one looks at the setting sun for a short time, and then covers\r\nhis closed eyes with his hand, he will for many seconds of time perceive\r\nthe image of the sun on his retina. A similar image of all other bodies\r\nwould remain some time in the eye, but is effaced by the eternal change of\r\nthe motions of the extremity of this nerve in our attention to other\r\nobjects. See Sect. XVIII. 5. on Sleep. Hence the dark spots, and other\r\nocular spectra, are more frequently attended to, and remain longer in the\r\neyes of weak people, as after violent exercise, intoxication, or want of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n6. A contraction of the fibres somewhat greater than usual introduces\r\npleasurable sensation into the system, according to the fourth law of\r\nanimal causation. Hence the pleasure in the beginning of drunkenness is\r\nowing to the increased action of the system from the stimulus of vinous\r\nspirit or of opium. If the contractions be still greater in energy or\r\nduration, painful sensations are introduced, as in consequence of great\r\nheat, or caustic applications, or fatigue.\r\n\r\nIf any part of the system, which is used to perpetual activity, as the\r\nstomach, or heart, or the fine vessels of the skin, acts for a time with\r\nless energy, another kind of painful sensation ensues, which is called\r\nhunger, or faintness, or cold. This occurs in a less degree in the\r\nlocomotive muscles, and is called wearysomeness. In the two former kinds of\r\nsensation there is an expenditure of sensorial power, in these latter there\r\nis an accumulation of it.\r\n\r\n7. We have used the words exertion of sensorial power as a general term to\r\nexpress either irritation, sensation, volition, or association; that is, to\r\nexpress the activity or motion of the spirit of animation, at the time it\r\nproduces the contractions of the fibrous parts of the system. It may be\r\nsupposed that there may exist a greater or less mobility of the fibrous\r\nparts of our system, or a propensity to be stimulated into contraction by\r\nthe greater or less quantity or energy of the spirit of animation; and that\r\nhence if the exertion of the sensorial power be in its natural state, and\r\nthe mobility of the fibres be increased, the same quantity of fibrous\r\ncontraction will be caused, as if the mobility of the fibres continues in\r\nits natural state, and the sensorial exertion be increased.\r\n\r\nThus it may be conceived, that in diseases accompanied with strength, as in\r\ninflammatory fevers with arterial strength, that the cause of greater\r\nfibrous contraction, may exist in the increased mobility of the fibres,\r\nwhose contractions are thence both more forceable and more frequent. And\r\nthat in diseases attended with debility, as in nervous fevers, where the\r\nfibrous contractions are weaker, and more frequent, it may be conceived\r\nthat the cause consists in a decrease of mobility of the fibres; and that\r\nthose weak constitutions, which are attended with cold extremities and\r\nlarge pupils of the eyes, may possess less mobility of the contractile\r\nfibres, as well as less quantity of exertion of the spirit of animation.\r\n\r\nIn answer to this mode of reasoning it may be sufficient to observe, that\r\nthe contractile fibres consist of inert matter, and when the sensorial\r\npower is withdrawn, as in death, they possess no power of motion at all,\r\nbut remain in their last state, whether of contraction or relaxation, and\r\nmust thence derive the whole of this property from the spirit of animation.\r\nAt the same time it is not improbable, that the moving fibres of strong\r\npeople may possess a capability of receiving or containing a greater\r\nquantity of the spirit of animation than those of weak people.\r\n\r\nIn every contraction of a fibre there is an expenditure of the sensorial\r\npower, or spirit of animation; and where the exertion of this sensorial\r\npower has been for some time increased, and the muscles or organs of sense\r\nhave in consequence acted with greater energy, its propensity to activity\r\nis proportionally lessened; which is to be ascribed to the exhaustion or\r\ndiminution of its quantity. On the contrary, where there has been less\r\nfibrous contraction than usual for a certain time, the sensorial power or\r\nspirit of animation becomes accumulated in the inactive part of the system.\r\nHence vigour succeeds rest, and hence the propensity to action of all our\r\norgans of sense and muscles is in a state of perpetual fluctuation. The\r\nirritability for instance of the retina, that is, its quantity of sensorial\r\npower, varies every moment according to the brightness or obscurity of the\r\nobject last beheld compared with the present one. The same occurs to our\r\nsense of heat, and to every part of our system, which is capable of being\r\nexcited into action.\r\n\r\nWhen this variation of the exertion of the sensorial power becomes much and\r\npermanently above or beneath the natural quantity, it becomes a disease. If\r\nthe irritative motions be too great or too little, it shews that the\r\nstimulus of external things affect this sensorial power too violently or\r\ntoo inertly. If the sensitive motions be too great or too little, the cause\r\narises from the deficient or exuberant quantity of sensation produced in\r\nconsequence of the motions of the muscular fibres or organs of sense; if\r\nthe voluntary actions are diseased the cause is to be looked for in the\r\nquantity of volition produced in consequence of the desire or aversion\r\noccasioned by the painful or pleasurable sensations above mentioned. And\r\nthe diseases of associations probably depend on the greater or less\r\nquantity of the other three sensorial powers by which they were formed.\r\n\r\nFrom whence it appears that the propensity to action, whether it be called\r\nirritability, sensibility, voluntarity, or associability, is only another\r\nmode of expression for the quantity of sensorial power residing in the\r\norgan to be excited. And that on the contrary the words inirritability and\r\ninsensibility, together with inaptitude to voluntary and associate motions,\r\nare synonymous with deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, or of\r\nthe spirit of animation, residing in the organs to be excited.\r\n\r\nII. _Of sensorial Exertion._\r\n\r\n1. There are three circumstances to be attended to in the production of\r\nanimal motions, 1st. The stimulus. 2d. The sensorial power. 3d. The\r\ncontractile fibre. 1st. A stimulus, external to the organ, originally\r\ninduces into action the sensorial faculty termed irritation; this produces\r\nthe contraction of the fibres, which, if it be perceived at all, introduces\r\npleasure or pain; which in their active state are termed sensation; which\r\nis another sensorial faculty, and occasionally produces contraction of the\r\nfibres; this pleasure or pain is therefore to be considered as another\r\nstimulus, which may either act alone or in conjunction with the former\r\nfaculty of the sensorium termed irritation.\r\n\r\nThis new stimulus of pleasure or pain either induces into action the\r\nsensorial faculty termed sensation, which then produces the contraction of\r\nthe fibres; or it introduces desire or aversion, which excite into action\r\nanother sensorial faculty, termed volition, and may therefore be considered\r\nas another stimulus, which either alone or in conjunction with one or both\r\nof the two former faculties of the sensorium produces the contraction of\r\nanimal fibres. There is another sensorial power, that of association, which\r\nperpetually, in conjunction with one or more of the above, and frequently\r\nsingly, produces the contraction of animal fibres, and which is itself\r\nexcited into action by the previous motions of contracting fibres.\r\n\r\nNow as the sensorial power, termed irritation, residing in any particular\r\nfibres, is excited into exertion by the stimulus of external bodies acting\r\non those fibres; the sensorial power, termed sensation, residing in any\r\nparticular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of pleasure or\r\npain acting on those fibres; the sensorial power, termed volition, residing\r\nin any particular fibres is excited into exertion by the stimulus of desire\r\nor aversion; and the sensorial power, termed association, residing in any\r\nparticular fibres, is excited into action by the stimulus of other fibrous\r\nmotions, which had frequently preceded them. The word stimulus may\r\ntherefore be used without impropriety of language, for any of these four\r\ncauses, which excite the four sensorial powers into exertion. For though\r\nthe immediate cause of volition has generally been termed _a motive_; and\r\nthat of irritation only has generally obtained the name of _stimulus_; yet\r\nas the immediate cause, which excites the sensorial powers of sensation, or\r\nof association into exertion, have obtained no general name, we shall use\r\nthe word stimulus for them all.\r\n\r\nHence the quantity of motion produced in any particular part of the animal\r\nsystem will be as the quantity of stimulus and the quantity of sensorial\r\npower, or spirit of animation, residing in the contracting fibres. Where\r\nboth these quantities are great, _strength_ is produced, when that word is\r\napplied to the motions of animal bodies. Where either of them is deficient,\r\n_weakness_ is produced, as applied to the motions of animal bodies.\r\n\r\nNow as the sensorial power, or spirit of animation, is perpetually\r\nexhausted by the expenditure of it in fibrous contractions, and is\r\nperpetually renewed by the secretion or production of it in the brain and\r\nspinal marrow, the quantity of animal strength must be in a perpetual state\r\nof fluctuation on this account; and if to this be added the unceasing\r\nvariation of all the four kinds of stimulus above described, which produce\r\nthe exertions of the sensorial powers, the ceaseless vicissitude of animal\r\nstrength becomes easily comprehended.\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of sensorial power remains the same, and the quantity of\r\nstimulus be lessened, a weakness of the fibrous contractions ensues, which\r\nmay be denominated _debility from defect of stimulus_. If the quantity of\r\nstimulus remains the same, and the quantity of sensorial power be lessened,\r\nanother kind of weakness ensues, which may be termed _debility from defect\r\nof sensorial power_; the former of these is called by Dr. Brown, in his\r\nElements of Medicine, direct debility, and the latter indirect debility.\r\nThe coincidence of some parts of this work with correspondent deductions in\r\nthe Brunonian Elementa Medicina, a work (with some exceptions) of great\r\ngenius, must be considered as confirmations of the truth of the theory, as\r\nthey were probably arrived at by different trains of reasoning.\r\n\r\nThus in those who have been exposed to cold and hunger there is a\r\ndeficiency of stimulus. While in nervous fever there is a deficiency of\r\nsensorial power. And in habitual drunkards, in a morning before their usual\r\npotation, there is a deficiency both of stimulus and of sensorial power.\r\nWhile, on the other hand, in the beginning of intoxication there is an\r\nexcess of stimulus; in the hot-ach, after the hands have been immersed in\r\nsnow, there is a redundancy of sensorial power; and in inflammatory\r\ndiseases with arterial strength, there is an excess of both.\r\n\r\nHence if the sensorial power be lessened, while the quantity of stimulus\r\nremains the same as in nervous fever, the frequency of repetition of the\r\narterial contractions may continue, but their force in respect to removing\r\nobstacles, as in promoting the circulation of the blood, or the velocity of\r\neach contraction, will be diminished, that is, the animal strength will be\r\nlessened. And secondly, if the quantity of sensorial power be lessened, and\r\nthe stimulus be increased to a certain degree, as in giving opium in\r\nnervous fevers, the arterial contractions may be performed more frequently\r\nthan natural, yet with less strength.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, if the sensorial power continues the same in respect to\r\nquantity, and the stimulus be somewhat diminished, as in going into a\r\ndarkish room, or into a coldish bath, suppose of about eighty degrees of\r\nheat, as Buxton-bath, a temporary weakness of the affected fibres is\r\ninduced, till an accumulation of sensorial power gradually succeeds, and\r\ncounterbalances the deficiency of stimulus, and then the bath ceases to\r\nfeel cold, and the room ceases to appear dark; because the fibres of the\r\nsubcutaneous vessels, or of the organs of sense, act with their usual\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nA set of muscular fibres may thus be stimulated into violent exertion, that\r\nis, they may act frequently, and with their whole sensorial power, but may\r\nnevertheless not act strongly; because the quantity of their sensorial\r\npower was originally small, or was previously exhausted. Hence a stimulus\r\nmay be great, and the irritation in consequence act with its full force, as\r\nin the hot paroxysms of nervous fever; but if the sensorial power, termed\r\nirritation, be small in quantity, the force of the fibrous contractions,\r\nand the times of their continuance in their contracted state, will be\r\nproportionally small.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner in the hot paroxysm of putrid fevers, which are shewn in\r\nSect. XXXIII. to be inflammatory fevers with arterial debility, the\r\nsensorial power termed sensation is exerted with great activity, yet the\r\nfibrous contractions, which produce the circulation of the blood, are\r\nperformed without strength, because the quantity of sensorial power then\r\nresiding in that part of the system is small.\r\n\r\nThus in irritative fever with arterial strength, that is, with excess of\r\nspirit of animation, the quantity of exertion during the hot part of the\r\nparoxysm is to be estimated from the quantity of stimulus, and the quantity\r\nof sensorial power. While in sensitive (or inflammatory) fever with\r\narterial strength, that is, with excess of spirit of animation, the violent\r\nand forcible actions of the vascular system during the hot part of the\r\nparoxysm are induced by the exertions of two sensorial powers, which are\r\nexcited by two kinds of stimulus. These are the sensorial power of\r\nirritation excited by the stimulus of bodies external to the moving fibres,\r\nand the sensorial power of sensation excited by the pain in consequence of\r\nthe increased contractions of those moving fibres.\r\n\r\nAnd in insane people in some cases the force of their muscular actions will\r\nbe in proportion to the quantity of sensorial power, which they possess,\r\nand the quantity of the stimulus of desire or aversion, which excites their\r\nvolition into action. At the same time in other cases the stimulus of pain\r\nor pleasure, and the stimulus of external bodies, may excite into action\r\nthe sensorial powers of sensation and irritation, and thus add greater\r\nforce to their muscular actions.\r\n\r\n2. The application of the stimulus, whether that stimulus be some quality\r\nof external bodies, or pleasure or pain, or desire or aversion, or a link\r\nof association, excites the correspondent sensorial power into action, and\r\nthis causes the contraction of the fibre. On the contraction of the fibre a\r\npart of the spirit of animation becomes expended, and the fibre ceases to\r\ncontract, though the stimulus continues to be applied; till in a certain\r\ntime the fibre having received a supply of sensorial power is ready to\r\ncontract again, if the stimulus continues to be applied. If the stimulus on\r\nthe contrary be withdrawn, the same quantity of quiescent sensorial power\r\nbecomes resident in the fibre as before its contraction; as appears from\r\nthe readiness for action of the large locomotive muscles of the body in a\r\nshort time after common exertion.\r\n\r\nBut in those muscular fibres, which are subject to constant stimulus, as\r\nthe arteries, glands, and capillary vessels, another phenomenon occurs, if\r\ntheir accustomed stimulus be withdrawn; which is, that the sensorial power\r\nbecomes accumulated in the contractile fibres, owing to the want of its\r\nbeing perpetually expended, or carried away, by their usual unremitted\r\ncontractions. And on this account those muscular fibres become afterwards\r\nexcitable into their natural actions by a much weaker stimulus; or into\r\nunnatural violence of action by their accustomed stimulus, as is seen in\r\nthe hot fits of intermittent fevers, which are in consequence of the\r\nprevious cold ones. Thus the minute vessels of the skin are constantly\r\nstimulated by the fluid matter of heat; if the quantity of this stimulus of\r\nheat be a while diminished, as in covering the hands with snow, the vessels\r\ncease to act, as appears from the paleness of the skin; if this cold\r\napplication of snow be continued but a short time, the sensorial power,\r\nwhich had habitually been supplied to the fibres, becomes now accumulated\r\nin them, owing to the want of its being expended by their accustomed\r\ncontractions. And thence a less stimulus of heat will now excite them into\r\nviolent contractions.\r\n\r\nIf the quiescence of fibres, which had previously been subject to perpetual\r\nstimulus, continues a longer time; or their accustomed stimulus be more\r\ncompletely withdrawn; the accumulation of sensorial power becomes still\r\ngreater, as in those exposed to cold and hunger; pain is produced, and the\r\norgan gradually dies from the chemical changes, which take place in it; or\r\nit is at a great distance of time restored to action by stimulus applied\r\nwith great caution in small quantity, as happens to some larger animals and\r\nto many insects, which during the winter months lie benumbed with cold, and\r\nare said to sleep, and to persons apparently drowned, or apparently frozen\r\nto death. Snails have been said to revive by throwing them into water after\r\nhaving been many years shut up in the cabinets of the curious; and eggs and\r\nseeds in general are restored to life after many months of torpor by the\r\nstimulus of warmth and moisture.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation of schirrous tumours, which have long existed in a state\r\nof inaction, is a process of this kind; as well as the sensibility acquired\r\nby inflamed tendons and bones, which had at their formation a similar\r\nsensibility, which had so long lain dormant in their uninflamed state.\r\n\r\n3. If after long quiescence from defect of stimulus the fibres, which had\r\npreviously been habituated to perpetual stimulus, are again exposed to but\r\ntheir usual quantity of it; as in those who have suffered the extremes of\r\ncold or hunger; a violent exertion of the affected organ commences, owing,\r\nas above explained, to the great accumulation of sensorial power. This\r\nviolent exertion not only diminishes the accumulated spirit of animation,\r\nbut at the same time induces pleasure or pain into the system, which,\r\nwhether it be succeeded by inflammation or not, becomes an additional\r\nstimulus, and acting along with the former one, produces still greater\r\nexertions; and thus reduces the sensorial power in the contracting fibres\r\nbeneath its natural quantity.\r\n\r\nWhen the spirit of animation is thus exhausted by useless exertions, the\r\norgan becomes torpid or unexcitable into action, and a second fit of\r\nquiescence succeeds that of abundant activity. During this second fit of\r\nquiescence the sensorial power becomes again accumulated, and another fit\r\nof exertion follows in train. These vicissitudes of exertion and inertion\r\nof the arterial system constitute the paroxysms of remittent fevers; or\r\nintermittent ones, when there is an interval of the natural action of the\r\narteries between the exacerbations.\r\n\r\nIn these paroxysms of fevers, which consist of the libration of the\r\narterial system between the extremes of exertion and quiescence, either the\r\nfits become less and less violent from the contractile fibres becoming\r\ncoming less excitable to the stimulus by habit, that is, by becoming\r\naccustomed to it, as explained below XII. 3. 1. or the whole sensorial\r\npower becomes exhausted, and the arteries cease to beat, and the patient\r\ndies in the cold part of the paroxysm. Or secondly, so much pain is\r\nintroduced into the system by the violent contractions of the fibres, that\r\ninflammation arises, which prevents future cold fits by expending a part of\r\nthe sensorial power in the extension of old vessels or the production of\r\nnew ones; and thus preventing the too great accumulation or exertion of it\r\nin other parts of the system; or which by the great increase of stimulus\r\nexcites into great action the whole glandular system as well as the\r\narterial, and thence a greater quantity of sensorial power is produced in\r\nthe brain, and thus its exhaustion in any peculiar part of the system\r\nceases to be affected.\r\n\r\n4. Or thirdly, in consequence of the painful or pleasurable sensation above\r\nmentioned, desire and aversion are introduced, and inordinate volition\r\nsucceeds; which by its own exertions expends so much of the spirit of\r\nanimation, that the two other sensorial faculties, or irritation and\r\nsensation, act so much more feebly; that the paroxysms of fever, or that\r\nlibration between the extremes of exertion and inactivity of the arterial\r\nsystem, gradually subsides. On this account a temporary insanity is a\r\nfavourable sign in fevers, as I have had some opportunities of observing.\r\n\r\nIII. _Of repeated Stimulus._\r\n\r\n1. When a stimulus is repeated more frequently than the expenditure of\r\nsensorial power can be renewed in the acting organ, the effect of the\r\nstimulus becomes gradually diminished. Thus if two grains of opium be\r\nswallowed by a person unused to so strong a stimulus, all the vascular\r\nsystems in the body act with greater energy, all the secretions and the\r\nabsorption from those secreted fluids are increased in quantity; and\r\npleasure or pain are introduced into the system, which adds an additional\r\nstimulus to that already too great. After some hours the sensorial power\r\nbecomes diminished in quantity, expended by the great activity of the\r\nsystem; and thence, when the stimulus of the opium is withdrawn, the fibres\r\nwill not obey their usual degree of natural stimulus, and a consequent\r\ntorpor or quiescence succeeds, as is experienced by drunkards, who on the\r\nday after a great excess of spirituous potation feel indigestion, head-ach,\r\nand general debility.\r\n\r\nIn this fit of torpor or quiescence of a part or of the whole of the\r\nsystem, an accumulation of the sensorial power in the affected fibres is\r\nformed, and occasions a second paroxysm of exertion by the application only\r\nof the natural stimulus, and thus a libration of the sensorial exertion\r\nbetween one excess and the other continues for two or three days, where the\r\nstimulus was violent in degree; and for weeks in some fevers, from the\r\nstimulus of contagious matter.\r\n\r\nBut if a second dose of opium be exhibited before the fibres have regained\r\ntheir natural quantity of sensorial power, its effect will be much less\r\nthan the former, because the spirit of animation or sensorial power is in\r\npart exhausted by the previous excess of exertion. Hence all medicines\r\nrepeated too frequently gradually lose their effect, as opium and wine.\r\nMany things of disagreeable taste at first cease to be disagreeable by\r\nfrequent repetition, as tobacco; grief and pain gradually diminish, and at\r\nlength cease altogether, and hence life itself becomes tolerable.\r\n\r\nBesides the temporary diminution of the spirit of animation or sensorial\r\npower, which is naturally stationary or resident in every living fibre, by\r\na single exhibition of a powerful stimulus, the contractile fibres\r\nthemselves, by the perpetual application of a new quantity of stimulus,\r\nbefore they have regained their natural quantity of sensorial power, appear\r\nto suffer in their capability of receiving so much as the natural quantity\r\nof sensorial power; and hence a permanent deficiency of spirit of animation\r\ntakes place, however long the stimulus may have been withdrawn. On this\r\ncause depends the permanent debility of those, who have been addicted to\r\nintoxication, the general weakness of old age, and the natural debility or\r\ninirritability of those, who have pale skins and large pupils of their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious phenomenon belongs to this place, which has always\r\nappeared difficult of solution; and that is, that opium or aloes may be\r\nexhibited in small doses at first, and gradually increased to very large\r\nones without producing stupor or diarrhoea. In this case, though the opium\r\nand aloes are given in such small doses as not to produce intoxication or\r\ncatharsis, yet they are exhibited in quantities sufficient in some degree\r\nto exhaust the sensorial power, and hence a stronger and a stronger dose is\r\nrequired; otherwise the medicine would soon cease to act at all.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if the opium or aloes be exhibited in a large dose at\r\nfirst, so as to produce intoxication or diarrhoea; after a few repetitions\r\nthe quantity of either of them may be diminished, and they will still\r\nproduce this effect. For the more powerful stimulus dissevers the\r\nprogressive catenations of animal motions, described in Sect. XVII. and\r\nintroduces a new link between them; whence every repetition strengthens\r\nthis new association or catenation, and the stimulus may be gradually\r\ndecreased, or be nearly withdrawn, and yet the effect shall continue;\r\nbecause the sensorial power of association or catenation being united with\r\nthe stimulus, increases in energy with every repetition of the catenated\r\ncircle; and it is by these means that all the irritative associations of\r\nmotions are originally produced.\r\n\r\n2. When a stimulus is repeated at such distant intervals of time, that the\r\nnatural quantity of sensorial power becomes completely restored in the\r\nacting fibres, it will act with the same energy as when first applied.\r\nHence those who have lately accustomed themselves to large doses of opium\r\nby beginning with small ones, and gradually increasing them, and repeating\r\nthem frequently, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph; if they intermit\r\nthe use of it for a few days only, must begin again with as small doses as\r\nthey took at first, otherwise they will experience the inconveniences of\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\nOn this circumstance depend the constant unfailing effects of the various\r\nkinds of stimulus, which excite into action all the vascular systems in the\r\nbody; the arterial, venous, absorbent, and glandular vessels, are brought\r\ninto perpetual unwearied action by the fluids, which are adapted to\r\nstimulate them; but these have the sensorial power of association added to\r\nthat of irritation, and even in some degree that of sensation, and even of\r\nvolition, as will be spoken of in their places; and life itself is thus\r\ncarried on by the production of sensorial power being equal to its waste or\r\nexpenditure in the perpetual movement of the vascular organization.\r\n\r\n3. When a stimulus is repeated at uniform intervals of time with such\r\ndistances between them, that the expenditure of sensorial power in the\r\nacting fibres becomes completely renewed, the effect is produced with\r\ngreater facility or energy. For the sensorial power of association is\r\ncombined with the sensorial power of irritation, or, in common language,\r\nthe acquired habit assists the power of the stimulus.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance not only obtains in the annual and diurnal catenations of\r\nanimal motions explained in Sect. XXXVI. but in every less circle of\r\nactions or ideas, as in the burthen of a song, or the iterations of a\r\ndance; and constitutes the pleasure we receive from repetition and\r\nimitation; as treated of in Sect. XXII. 2.\r\n\r\n4. When a stimulus has been many times repeated at uniform intervals, so as\r\nto produce the complete action of the organ, it may then be gradually\r\ndiminished, or totally withdrawn, and the action of the organ will\r\ncontinue. For the sensorial power of association becomes united with that\r\nof irritation, and by frequent repetition becomes at length of sufficient\r\nenergy to carry on the new link in the circle of actions, without the\r\nirritation which at first introduced it.\r\n\r\nHence, when the bark is given at stated intervals for the cure of\r\nintermittent fevers, if sixty grains of it be given every three hours for\r\nthe twenty-four hours preceding the expected paroxysm, so as to stimulate\r\nthe defective part of the system into action, and by that means to prevent\r\nthe torpor or quiescence of the fibres, which constitutes the cold fit;\r\nmuch less than half the quantity, given before the time at which another\r\nparoxysm of quiescence would have taken place, will be sufficient to\r\nprevent it; because now the sensorial power, termed association, acts in a\r\ntwofold manner. First, in respect to the period of the catenation in which\r\nthe cold fit was produced, which is now dissevered by the stronger stimulus\r\nof the first doses of the bark; and, secondly, because each dose of bark\r\nbeing repeated at periodical times, has its effect increased by the\r\nsensorial faculty of association being combined with that of irritation.\r\n\r\nNow, when sixty grains of Peruvian bark are taken twice a day, suppose at\r\nten o'clock and at six, for a fortnight, the irritation excited by this\r\nadditional stimulus becomes a part of the diurnal circle of actions, and\r\nwill at length carry on the increased action of the system without the\r\nassistance of the stimulus of the bark. On this theory the bitter\r\nmedicines, chalybeates, and opiates in appropriated doses, exhibited for a\r\nfortnight, give permanent strength to pale feeble children, and other weak\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\n5. When a defect of stimulus, as of heat, recurs at certain diurnal\r\nintervals, which induces some torpor or quiescence of a part of the system,\r\nthe diurnal catenation of actions becomes disordered, and a new association\r\nwith this link of torpid action is formed; on the next period the quantity\r\nof quiescence will be increased, suppose the same defect of stimulus to\r\nrecur, because now the new association conspires with the defective\r\nirritation in introducing the torpid action of this part of the diurnal\r\ncatenation. In this manner many fever-fits commence, where the patient is\r\nfor some days indisposed at certain hours, before the cold paroxysm of\r\nfever is completely formed. See Sect. XVII. 3. 3. on Catenation of Animal\r\nMotions.\r\n\r\n6. If a stimulus, which at first excited the affected organ into so great\r\nexertion as to produce sensation, be continued for a certain time, it will\r\ncease to produce sensation both then and when repeated, though the\r\nirritative motions in consequence of it may continue or be re-excited.\r\n\r\nMany catenations of irritative motions were at first succeeded by\r\nsensation, as the apparent motions of objects when we walk past them, and\r\nprobably the vital motions themselves in the early state of our existence.\r\nBut as those sensations were followed by no movements of the system in\r\nconsequence of them, they gradually ceased to be produced, not being joined\r\nto any succeeding link of catenation. Hence contagious matter, which has\r\nfor some weeks stimulated the system into great and permanent sensation,\r\nceases afterwards to produce general sensation, or inflammation, though it\r\nmay still induce topical irritations. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 8. XIX. 9.\r\n\r\nOur absorbent system then seems to receive those contagious matters, which\r\nit has before experienced, in the same manner as it imbibes common moisture\r\nor other fluids; that is, without being thrown into so violent action as to\r\nproduce sensation; the consequence of which is an increase of daily energy\r\nor activity, till inflammation and its consequences succeed.\r\n\r\n7. If a stimulus excites an organ into such violent contractions as to\r\nproduce sensation, the motions of which organ had not usually produced\r\nsensation, this new sensorial power, added to the irritation occasioned by\r\nthe stimulus, increases the activity of the organ. And if this activity be\r\ncatenated with the diurnal circle of actions, an increasing inflammation is\r\nproduced; as in the evening paroxysms of small-pox, and other fevers with\r\ninflammation. And hence schirrous tumours, tendons and membranes, and\r\nprobably the arteries themselves become inflamed, when they are strongly\r\nstimulated.\r\n\r\nIV. _Of Stimulus greater than natural._\r\n\r\n1. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increased\r\nexertion of sensorial power, whether that exertion be in the mode of\r\nirritation, sensation, volition, or association, diminishes the general\r\nquantity of it. This fact is observable in the progress of intoxication, as\r\nthe increased quantity or energy of the irritative motions, owing to the\r\nstimulus of vinous spirit, introduces much pleasurable sensation into the\r\nsystem, and much exertion of muscular or sensual motions in consequence of\r\nthis increased sensation; the voluntary motions, and even the associate\r\nones, become much impaired or diminished; and delirium and staggering\r\nsucceed. See Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness. And hence the great prostration of\r\nthe strength of the locomotive muscles in some fevers, is owing to the\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power by the increased action of the arterial\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn like manner a stimulus greater than natural, applied to a part of the\r\nsystem, increases the exertion of sensorial power in that part, and\r\ndiminishes it in some other part. As in the commencement of scarlet fever,\r\nit is usual to see great redness and heat on the faces and breasts of\r\nchildren, while at the same time their feet are colder than natural;\r\npartial heats are observable in other fevers with debility, and are\r\ngenerally attended with torpor or quiescence of some other part of the\r\nsystem. But these partial exertions of sensorial power are sometimes\r\nattended with increased partial exertions in other parts of the system,\r\nwhich sympathize with them, as the flushing of the face after a full meal.\r\nBoth these therefore are to be ascribed to sympathetic associations,\r\nexplained in Sect. XXXV. and not to general exhaustion or accumulation of\r\nsensorial power.\r\n\r\n2. A quantity of stimulus greater than natural, producing an increased\r\nexertion of sensorial power in any particular organ, diminishes the\r\nquantity of it in that organ. This appears from the contractions of animal\r\nfibres being not so easily excited by a less stimulus after the organ has\r\nbeen subjected to a greater. Thus after looking at any luminous object of a\r\nsmall size, as at the setting sun, for a short time, so as not much to\r\nfatigue the eye, this part of the retina becomes less sensible to smaller\r\nquantities of light; hence when the eyes are turned on other less luminous\r\nparts of the sky, a dark spot is seen resembling the shape of the sun, or\r\nother luminous object which we last behold. See Sect. XL. No. 2.\r\n\r\nThus we are some time before we can distinguish objects in an obscure room\r\nafter coming from bright day-light, though the iris presently contracts\r\nitself. We are not able to hear weak sounds after loud ones. And the\r\nstomachs of those who have been much habituated to the stronger stimulus of\r\nfermented or spirituous liquors, are not excited into due action by weaker\r\nones.\r\n\r\n3. A quantity of stimulus something greater than the last mentioned, or\r\nlonger continued, induces the organ into spasmodic action, which ceases and\r\nrecurs alternately. Thus on looking for a time on the setting sun, so as\r\nnot greatly to fatigue the sight, a yellow spectrum is seen when the eyes\r\nare closed and covered, which continues for a time, and then disappears and\r\nrecurs repeatedly before it entirely vanishes. See Sect. XL. No. 5. Thus\r\nthe action of vomiting ceases and is renewed by intervals, although the\r\nemetic drug is thrown up with the first effort. A tenesmus continues by\r\nintervals some time after the exclusion of acrid excrement; and the\r\npulsations of the heart of a viper are said to continue some time after it\r\nis cleared from its blood.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce pain\r\naccording to law 4; and this pain constitutes an additional kind or\r\nquantity of excitement, which again induces the fibres into contraction,\r\nand which painful excitement is again renewed, and again induces\r\ncontractions of the fibres with gradually diminishing effect.\r\n\r\n4. A quantity of stimulus greater than that last mentioned, or longer\r\ncontinued, induces the antagonist muscles into spasmodic action. This is\r\nbeautifully illustrated by the ocular spectra described in Sect. XL. No. 6.\r\nto which the reader is referred. From those experiments there is reason to\r\nconclude that the fatigued part of the retina throws itself into a contrary\r\nmode of action like oscitation or pandiculation, as soon as the stimulus,\r\nwhich has fatigued it, is withdrawn; but that it still remains liable to be\r\nexcited into action by any other colours except the colour with which it\r\nhas been fatigued. Thus the yawning and stretching the limbs after a\r\ncontinued action or attitude seems occasioned by the antagonist muscles\r\nbeing stimulated by their extension during the contractions of those in\r\naction, or in the situation in which that action last left them.\r\n\r\n5. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,\r\ninduces variety of convulsions or fixed spasms either of the affected organ\r\nor of the moving fibres in the other parts of the body. In respect to the\r\nspectra in the eye, this is well illustrated in No. 7 and 8, of Sect. XL.\r\nEpileptic convulsions, as the emprosthotonos and opisthotonos, with the\r\ncramp of the calf of the leg, locked jaw, and other cataleptic fits, appear\r\nto originate from pain, as some of these patients scream aloud before the\r\nconvulsion takes place; which seems at first to be an effort to relieve\r\npainful sensation, and afterwards an effort to prevent it.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the violent contractions of the fibres produce so much pain,\r\nas to constitute a perpetual excitement; and that in so great a degree as\r\nto allow but small intervals of relaxation of the contracting fibres as in\r\nconvulsions, or no intervals at all as in fixed spasms.\r\n\r\n6. A quantity of stimulus greater than the last, or longer continued,\r\nproduces a paralysis of the organ. In many cases this paralysis is only a\r\ntemporary effect, as on looking long on a small area of bright red silk\r\nplaced on a sheet of white paper on the floor in a strong light, the red\r\nsilk gradually becomes paler, and at length disappears; which evinces that\r\na part of the retina, by being violently excited, becomes for a time\r\nunaffected by the stimulus of that colour. Thus cathartic medicines,\r\nopiates, poisons, contagious matter, cease to influence our system after it\r\nhas been habituated to the use of them, except by the exhibition of\r\nincreased quantities of them; our fibres not only become unaffected by\r\nstimuli, by which they have previously been violently irritated, as by the\r\nmatter of the small-pox or measles; but they also become unaffected by\r\nsensation, where the violent exertions, which disabled them, were in\r\nconsequence of too great quantity of sensation. And lastly the fibres,\r\nwhich become disobedient to volition, are probably disabled by their too\r\nviolent exertions in consequence of too great a quantity of volition.\r\n\r\nAfter every exertion of our fibres a temporary paralysis succeeds, whence\r\nthe intervals of all muscular contractions, as mentioned in No. 3 and 4 of\r\nthis Section; the immediate cause of these more permanent kinds of\r\nparalysis is probably owing in the same manner to the too great exhaustion\r\nof the spirit of animation in the affected part; so that a stronger\r\nstimulus is required, or one of a different kind from that, which\r\noccasioned those too violent contractions, to again excite the affected\r\norgan into activity; and if a stronger stimulus could be applied, it must\r\nagain induce paralysis.\r\n\r\nFor these powerful stimuli excite pain at the same time, that they produce\r\nirritation; and this pain not only excites fibrous motions by its stimulus,\r\nbut it also produces volition; and thus all these stimuli acting at the\r\nsame time, and sometimes with the addition of their associations, produce\r\nso great exertion as to expend the whole of the sensorial power in the\r\naffected fibres.\r\n\r\nV. _Of Stimulus less than natural._\r\n\r\n1. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, producing a decreased exertion\r\nof sensorial power, occasions an accumulation of the general quantity of\r\nit. This circumstance is observable in the hemiplagia, in which the\r\npatients are perpetually moving the muscles, which are unaffected. On this\r\naccount we awake with greater vigour after sleep, because during so many\r\nhours, the great usual expenditure of sensorial power in the performance of\r\nvoluntary actions, and in the exertions of our organs of sense, in\r\nconsequence of the irritations occasioned by external objects had been\r\nsuspended, and a consequent accumulation had taken place.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the exertion of the sensorial power less than natural in one\r\npart of the system, is liable to produce an increase of the exertion of it\r\nin some other part. Thus by the action of vomiting, in which the natural\r\nexertion of the motions of the stomach are destroyed or diminished, an\r\nincreased absorption of the pulmonary and cellular lymphatics is produced,\r\nas is known by the increased absorption of the fluid deposited in them in\r\ndropsical cases. But these partial quiescences of sensorial power are also\r\nsometimes attended with other partial quiescences, which sympathize with\r\nthem, as cold and pale extremities from hunger. These therefore are to be\r\nascribed to the associations of sympathy explained in Sect. XXXV. and not\r\nto the general accumulation of sensorial power.\r\n\r\n2. A quantity of stimulus less than natural, applied to fibres previously\r\naccustomed to perpetual stimulus, is succeeded by accumulation of sensorial\r\npower in the affected organ. The truth of this proposition is evinced,\r\nbecause a stimulus less than natural, if it be somewhat greater than that\r\nabove mentioned, will excite the organ so circumstanced into violent\r\nactivity. Thus on a frosty day with wind, the face of a person exposed to\r\nthe wind is at first pale and shrunk; but on turning the face from the\r\nwind, it becomes soon of a glow with warmth and flushing. The glow of the\r\nskin in emerging from the cold-bath is owing to the same cause.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear, that an accumulation of sensorial power above the\r\nnatural quantity is acquired by those muscles, which are not subject to\r\nperpetual stimulus, as the locomotive muscles: these, after the greatest\r\nfatigue, only acquire by rest their usual aptitude to motion; whereas the\r\nvascular system, as the heart and arteries, after a short quiescence, are\r\nthrown into violent action by their natural quantity of stimulus.\r\n\r\nNevertheless by this accumulation of sensorial power during the application\r\nof decreased stimulus, and by the exhaustion of it during the action of\r\nincreased stimulus, it is wisely provided, that the actions of the vascular\r\nmuscles and organs of sense are not much deranged by small variations of\r\nstimulus; as the quantity of sensorial power becomes in some measure\r\ninversely as the quantity of stimulus.\r\n\r\n3. A quantity of stimulus less than that mentioned above, and continued for\r\nsome time, induces pain in the affected organ, as the pain of cold in the\r\nhands, when they are immersed in snow, is owing to a deficiency of the\r\nstimulation of heat. Hunger is a pain from the deficiency of the\r\nstimulation of food. Pain in the back at the commencement of ague-fits, and\r\nthe head-achs which attend feeble people, are pains from defect of\r\nstimulus, and are hence relieved by opium, essential oils, spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nAs the pains, which originate from defect of stimulus, only occur in those\r\nparts of the system, which have been previously subjected to perpetual\r\nstimulus; and as an accumulation of sensorial power is produced in the\r\nquiescent organ along with the pain, as in cold or hunger, there is reason\r\nto believe, that the pain is owing to the accumulation of sensorial power.\r\nFor, in the locomotive muscles, in the retina of the eye, and other organs\r\nof senses, no pain occurs from the absence of stimulus, nor any great\r\naccumulation of sensorial power beyond their natural quantity, since these\r\norgans have not been used to a perpetual supply of it. There is indeed a\r\ngreater accumulation occurs in the organ of vision after its quiescence,\r\nbecause it is subject to more constant stimulus.\r\n\r\n4. A certain quantity of stimulus less than natural induces the moving\r\norgan into feebler and more frequent contractions, as mentioned in No. I.\r\n4. of this Section. For each contraction moving through a less space, or\r\nwith less force, that is, with less expenditure of the spirit of animation,\r\nis sooner relaxed, and the spirit of animation derived at each interval\r\ninto the acting fibres being less, these intervals likewise become shorter.\r\nHence the tremours of the hands of people accustomed to vinous spirit, till\r\nthey take their usual stimulus; hence the quick pulse in fevers attended\r\nwith debility, which is greater than in fevers attended with strength; in\r\nthe latter the pulse seldom beats above 120 times in a minute, in the\r\nformer it frequently exceeds 140.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, that in this and the two following articles the\r\ndecreased action of the system is probably more frequently occasioned by\r\ndeficiency in the quantity of sensorial power, than in the quantity of\r\nstimulus. Thus those feeble constitutions which have large pupils of their\r\neyes, and all who labour under nervous fevers, seem to owe their want of\r\nnatural quantity of activity in the system to the deficiency of sensorial\r\npower; since, as far as can be seen, they frequently possess the natural\r\nquantity of stimulus.\r\n\r\n5. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, inverts\r\nthe order of successive fibrous contractions; as in vomiting the vermicular\r\nmotions of the stomach and duodenum are inverted, and their contents\r\nejected, which is probably owing to the exhaustion of the spirit of\r\nanimation in the acting muscles by a previous excessive stimulus, as by the\r\nroot of ipecacuanha, and the consequent defect of sensorial power. The same\r\nretrograde motions affect the whole intestinal canal in ileus; and the\r\noesophagus in globus hystericus. See this further explained in Sect. XXIX.\r\nNo. 11. on Retrograde Motions.\r\n\r\nI must observe, also, that something similar happens in the production of\r\nour ideas, or sensual motions, when they are too weakly excited; when any\r\none is thinking intensely about one thing, and carelessly conversing about\r\nanother, he is liable to use the word of a contrary meaning to that which\r\nhe designed, as cold weather for hot weather, summer for winter.\r\n\r\n6. A certain quantity of stimulus, less than that above mentioned, is\r\nsucceeded by paralysis, first of the voluntary and sensitive motions, and\r\nafterwards of those of irritation, and of association, which constitutes\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nVI. _Cure of increased Exertion._\r\n\r\n1. The cure, which nature has provided for the increased exertion of any\r\npart of the system, consists in the consequent expenditure of the sensorial\r\npower. But as a greater torpor follows this exhaustion of sensorial power,\r\nas explained in the next paragraph, and a greater exertion succeeds this\r\ntorpor, the constitution frequently sinks under these increasing librations\r\nbetween exertion and quiescence; till at length complete quiescence, that\r\nis, death, closes the scene.\r\n\r\nFor, during the great exertion of the system in the hot fit of fever, an\r\nincrease of stimulus is produced from the greater momentum of the blood,\r\nthe greater distention of the heart and arteries, and the increased\r\nproduction of heat, by the violent actions of the system occasioned by this\r\naugmentation of stimulus, the sensorial power becomes diminished in a few\r\nhours much beneath its natural quantity, the vessels at length cease to\r\nobey even these great degrees of stimulus, as shewn in Sect. XL. 9. 1. and\r\na torpor of the whole or of a part of the system ensues.\r\n\r\nNow as this second cold fit commences with a greater deficiency of\r\nsensorial power, it is also attended with a greater deficiency of stimulus\r\nthan in the preceding cold fit, that is, with less momentum of blood, less\r\ndistention of the heart. On this account the second cold fit becomes more\r\nviolent and of longer duration than the first; and as a greater\r\naccumulation of sensorial power must be produced before the system of\r\nvessels will again obey the diminished stimulus, it follows, that the\r\nsecond hot fit of fever will be more violent than the former one. And that\r\nunless some other causes counteract either the violent exertions in the hot\r\nfit, or the great torpor in the cold fit, life will at length be\r\nextinguished by the expenditure of the whole of the sensorial power. And\r\nfrom hence it appears, that the true means of curing fevers must be such as\r\ndecrease the action of the system in the hot fit, and increase it in the\r\ncold fit; that is, such as prevent the too great diminution of sensorial\r\npower in the hot fit, and the too great accumulation of it in the cold one.\r\n\r\n2. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much increased, as in the\r\nhot fits of fever or inflammation, the following are the usual means of\r\nrelieving it. Decrease the irritations by blood-letting, and other\r\nevacuations; by cold water taken into the stomach, or injected as an enema,\r\nor used externally; by cold air breathed into the lungs, and diffused over\r\nthe skin; with food of less stimulus than the patient has been accustomed\r\nto.\r\n\r\n3. As a cold fit, or paroxysm of inactivity of some parts of the system,\r\ngenerally precedes the hot fit, or paroxysm of exertion, by which the\r\nsensorial power becomes accumulated, this cold paroxysm should be prevented\r\nby stimulant medicines and diet, as wine, opium, bark, warmth,\r\ncheerfulness, anger, surprise.\r\n\r\n4. Excite into greater action some other part of the system, by which means\r\nthe spirit of animation may be in part expended, and thence the inordinate\r\nactions of the diseased part may be lessened. Hence when a part of the skin\r\nacts violently, as of the face in the eruption of the small-pox, if the\r\nfeet be cold they should be covered. Hence the use of a blister applied\r\nnear a topical inflammation. Hence opium and warm bath relieve pains both\r\nfrom excess and defect of stimulus.\r\n\r\n5. First increase the general stimulation above its natural quantity, which\r\nmay in some degree exhaust the spirit of animation, and then decrease the\r\nstimulation beneath its natural quantity. Hence after sudorific medicines\r\nand warm air, the application of refrigerants may have greater effect, if\r\nthey could be administered without danger of producing too great torpor of\r\nsome part of the system; as frequently happens to people in health from\r\ncoming out of a warm room into the cold air, by which a topical\r\ninflammation in consequence of torpor of the mucous membrane of the nostril\r\nis produced, and is termed a cold in the head.\r\n\r\nVII. _Cure of decreased Exertion._\r\n\r\n1. Where the exertion of the sensorial powers is much decreased, as in the\r\ncold fits of fever, a gradual accumulation of the spirit of animation takes\r\nplace; as occurs in all cases where inactivity or torpor of a part of the\r\nsystem exists; this accumulation of sensorial power increases, till stimuli\r\nless than natural are sufficient to throw it into action, then the cold fit\r\nceases; and from the action of the natural stimuli a hot one succeeds with\r\nincreased activity of the whole system.\r\n\r\nSo in fainting fits, or syncope, there is a temporary deficiency of\r\nsensorial exertion, and a consequent quiescence of a great part of the\r\nsystem. This quiescence continues, till the sensorial power becomes again\r\naccumulated in the torpid organs; and then the usual diurnal stimuli excite\r\nthe revivescent parts again into action; but as this kind of quiescence\r\ncontinues but a short time compared to the cold paroxysm of an ague, and\r\nless affects the circulatory system, a less superabundancy of exertion\r\nsucceeds in the organs previously torpid, and a less excess of arterial\r\nactivity. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 6.\r\n\r\n2. In the diseases occasioned by a defect of sensorial exertion, as in cold\r\nfits of ague, hysteric complaint, and nervous fever, the following means\r\nare those commonly used. 1. Increase the stimulation above its natural\r\nquantity for some weeks, till a new habit of more energetic contraction of\r\nthe fibres is established. This is to be done by wine, opium, bark, steel,\r\ngiven at exact periods, and in appropriate quantities; for if these\r\nmedicines be given in such quantity, as to induce the least degree of\r\nintoxication, a debility succeeds from the useless exhaustion of spirit of\r\nanimation in consequence of too great exertion of the muscles or organs of\r\nsense. To these irritative stimuli should be added the sensitive ones of\r\ncheerful ideas, hope, affection.\r\n\r\n3. Change the kinds of stimulus. The habits acquired by the constitution\r\ndepend on such nice circumstances, that when one kind of stimulus ceases to\r\nexcite the sensorial power into the quantity of exertion necessary to\r\nhealth, it is often sufficient to change the stimulus for another\r\napparently similar in quantity and quality. Thus when wine ceases to\r\nstimulate the constitution, opium in appropriate doses supplies the defect;\r\nand the contrary. This is also observed in the effects of cathartic\r\nmedicines, when one loses its power, another, apparently less efficacious,\r\nwill succeed. Hence a change of diet, drink, and stimulating medicines, is\r\noften advantageous in diseases of debility.\r\n\r\n4. Stimulate the organs, whose motions are associated with the torpid parts\r\nof the system. The actions of the minute vessels of the various parts of\r\nthe external skin are not only associated with each other, but are strongly\r\nassociated with those of some of the internal membranes, and particularly\r\nof the stomach. Hence when the exertion of the stomach is less than\r\nnatural, and indigestion and heartburn succeed, nothing so certainly\r\nremoves these symptoms as the stimulus of a blister on the back. The\r\ncoldness of the extremities, as of the nose, ears, or fingers, are hence\r\nthe best indication for the successful application of blisters.\r\n\r\n5. Decrease the stimulus for a time. By lessening the quantity of heat for\r\na minute or two by going into the cold bath, a great accumulation of\r\nsensorial power is produced; for not only the minute vessels of the whole\r\nexternal skin for a time become inactive, as appears by their paleness; but\r\nthe minute vessels of the lungs lose much of their activity also by concert\r\nwith those of the skin, as appears from the difficulty of breathing at\r\nfirst going into cold water. On emerging from the bath the sensorial power\r\nis thrown into great exertion by the stimulus of the common degree of the\r\nwarmth of the atmosphere, and a great production of animal heat is the\r\nconsequence. The longer a person continues in the cold bath the greater\r\nmust be the present inertion of a great part of the system, and in\r\nconsequence a greater accumulation of sensorial power. Whence M. Pomè\r\nrecommends some melancholy patients to be kept from two to six hours in\r\nspring-water, and in baths still colder.\r\n\r\n6. Decrease the stimulus for a time below the natural, and then increase it\r\nabove natural. The effect of this process, improperly used, is seen in\r\ngiving much food, or applying much warmth, to those who have been\r\npreviously exposed to great hunger, or to great cold. The accumulated\r\nsensorial power is thrown into so violent exertion, that inflammations and\r\nmortifications supervene, and death closes the catastrophe. In many\r\ndiseases this method is the most successful; hence the bark in agues\r\nproduces more certain effect after the previous exhibition of emetics. In\r\ndiseases attended with violent pain, opium has double the effect, if\r\nvenesection and a cathartic have been previously used. On this seems to\r\nhave been founded the successful practice of Sydenham, who used venesection\r\nand a cathartic in chlorosis before the exhibition of the bark, steel, and\r\nopiates.\r\n\r\n7. Prevent any unnecessary expenditure of sensorial power. Hence in fevers\r\nwith debility, a decumbent posture is preferred, with silence, little\r\nlight, and such a quantity of heat as may prevent any chill sensation, or\r\nany coldness of the extremities. The pulse of patients in fevers with\r\ndebility increases in frequency above ten pulsations in a minute on their\r\nrising out of bed. For the expenditure of sensorial power to preserve an\r\nerect posture of the body adds to the general deficiency of it, and thus\r\naffects the circulation.\r\n\r\n8. The longer in time and the greater in degree the quiescence or inertion\r\nof an organ has been, so that it still retains life or excitability, the\r\nless stimulus should at first be applied to it. The quantity of stimulation\r\nis a matter of great nicety to determine, where the torpor or quiescence of\r\nthe fibres has been experienced in a great degree, or for a considerable\r\ntime, as in cold fits of the ague, in continued fevers with great debility,\r\nor in people famished at sea, or perishing with cold. In the two last\r\ncases, very minute quantities of food should be first supplied, and very\r\nfew additional degrees of heat. In the two former cases, but little\r\nstimulus of wine or medicine, above what they had been lately accustomed\r\nto, should be exhibited, and this at frequent and stated intervals, so that\r\nthe effect of one quantity may be observed before the exhibition of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIf these circumstances are not attended to, as the sensorial power becomes\r\naccumulated in the quiescent fibres, an inordinate exertion takes place by\r\nthe increase of stimulus acting on the accumulated quantity of sensorial\r\npower, and either the paralysis, or death of the contractile fibres ensues,\r\nfrom the total expenditure of the sensorial power in the affected organ,\r\nowing to this increase of exertion, like the debility after intoxication.\r\nOr, secondly, the violent exertions above mentioned produce painful\r\nsensation, which becomes a new stimulus, and by thus producing\r\ninflammation, and increasing the activity of the fibres already too great,\r\nsooner exhausts the whole of the sensorial power in the acting organ, and\r\nmortification, that is, the death of the part, supervenes.\r\n\r\nHence there have been many instances of people, whose limbs have been long\r\nbenumbed by exposure to cold, who have lost them by mortification on their\r\nbeing too hastily brought to the fire; and of others, who were nearly\r\nfamished at sea, who have died soon after having taken not more than an\r\nusual meal of food. I have heard of two well-attested instances of patients\r\nin the cold fit of ague, who have died from the exhibition of gin and\r\nvinegar, by the inflammation which ensued. And in many fevers attended with\r\ndebility, the unlimited use of wine, and the wanton application of\r\nblisters, I believe, has destroyed numbers by the debility consequent to\r\ntoo great stimulation, that is, by the exhaustion of the sensorial power by\r\nits inordinate exertion.\r\n\r\nWherever the least degree of intoxication exists, a proportional debility\r\nis the consequence; but there is a golden rule by which the necessary and\r\nuseful quantity of stimulus in fevers with debility may be ascertained.\r\nWhen wine or beer are exhibited either alone or diluted with water, if the\r\npulse becomes slower the stimulus is of a proper quantity; and should be\r\nrepeated every two or three hours, or when the pulse again becomes quicker.\r\n\r\nIn the chronical debility brought on by drinking spirituous or fermented\r\nliquors, there is another golden rule by which I have successfully directed\r\nthe quantity of spirit which they may safely lessen, for there is no other\r\nmeans by which they can recover their health. It should be premised, that\r\nwhere the power of digestion in these patients is totally destroyed, there\r\nis not much reason to expect a return to healthful vigour.\r\n\r\nI have directed several of these patients to omit one fourth part of the\r\nquantity of vinous spirit they have been lately accustomed to, and if in a\r\nfortnight their appetite increases, they are advised to omit another fourth\r\npart; but if they perceive that their digestion becomes impaired from the\r\nwant of this quantity of spirituous potation, they are advised to continue\r\nas they are, and rather bear the ills they have, than risk the encounter of\r\ngreater. At the same time flesh-meat with or without spice is recommended,\r\nwith Peruvian bark and steel in small quantities between their meals, and\r\nhalf a grain of opium or a grain, with five or eight grains of rhubarb at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XIII.\r\n\r\nOF VEGETABLE ANIMATION.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Vegetables are irritable; mimosa, dionæa muscipula. Vegetable\r\n    secretions._ 2. _Vegetable buds are inferior animals, are liable to\r\n    greater or less irritability._ II. _Stamens and pistils of plants shew\r\n    marks of sensibility._ III. _Vegetables possess some degree of\r\n    volition._ IV. _Motions of plants are associated like those of\r\n    animals._ V. 1. _Vegetable structure like that of animals, their\r\n    anthers and stigmas are living creatures. Male-flowers of Vallisneria._\r\n    2. _Whether vegetables, possess ideas? They have organs of sense as of\r\n    touch and smell, and ideas of external things?_\r\n\r\nI. 1. The fibres of the vegetable world, as well as those of the animal,\r\nare excitable into a variety of motion by irritations of external objects.\r\nThis appears particularly in the mimosa or sensitive plant, whose leaves\r\ncontract on the slightest injury; the dionæa muscipula, which was lately\r\nbrought over from the marshes of America, presents us with another curious\r\ninstance of vegetable irritability; its leaves are armed with spines on\r\ntheir upper edge, and are spread on the ground around the stem; when an\r\ninsect creeps on any of them in its passage to the flower or seed, the leaf\r\nshuts up like a steel rat-trap, and destroys its enemy. See Botanic Garden,\r\nPart II. note on Silene.\r\n\r\nThe various secretions of vegetables, as of odour, fruit, gum, resin, wax,\r\nhoney, seem brought about in the same manner as in the glands of animals;\r\nthe tasteless moisture of the earth is converted by the hop-plant into a\r\nbitter juice; as by the caterpillar in the nut-shell the sweet kernel is\r\nconverted into a bitter powder. While the power of absorption in the roots\r\nand barks of vegetables is excited into action by the fluids applied to\r\ntheir mouths like the lacteals and lymphatics of animals.\r\n\r\n2. The individuals of the vegetable world may be considered as inferior or\r\nless perfect animals; a tree is a congeries of many living buds, and in\r\nthis respect resembles the branches of coralline, which are a congeries of\r\na multitude of animals. Each of these buds of a tree has its proper leaves\r\nor petals for lungs, produces its viviparous or its oviparous offspring in\r\nbuds or seeds; has its own roots, which extending down the stem of the tree\r\nare interwoven with the roots of the other buds, and form the bark, which\r\nis the only living part of the stem, is annually renewed, and is\r\nsuperinduced upon the former bark, which then dies, and with its stagnated\r\njuices gradually hardening into wood forms the concentric circles, which we\r\nsee in blocks of timber.\r\n\r\nThe following circumstances evince the individuality of the buds of trees.\r\nFirst, there are many trees, whose whole internal wood is perished, and yet\r\nthe branches are vegete and healthy. Secondly, the fibres of the barks of\r\ntrees are chiefly longitudinal, resembling roots, as is beautifully seen in\r\nthose prepared barks, that were lately brought from Otaheita. Thirdly, in\r\nhorizontal wounds of the bark of trees, the fibres of the upper lip are\r\nalways elongated downwards like roots, but those of the lower lip do not\r\napproach to meet them. Fourthly, if you wrap wet moss round any joint of a\r\nvine, or cover it with moist earth, roots will shoot out from it. Fifthly,\r\nby the inoculation or engrafting of trees many fruits are produced from one\r\nstem. Sixthly, a new tree is produced from a branch plucked from an old\r\none, and set in the ground. Whence it appears that the buds of deciduous\r\ntrees are so many annual plants, that the bark is a contexture of the roots\r\nof each individual bud; and that the internal wood is of no other use but\r\nto support them in the air, and that thus they resemble the animal world in\r\ntheir individuality.\r\n\r\nThe irritability of plants, like that of animals, appears liable to be\r\nincreased or decreased by habit; for those trees or shrubs, which are\r\nbrought from a colder climate to a warmer, put out their leaves and\r\nblossoms a fortnight sooner than the indigenous ones.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kalm, in his Travels in New York, observes that the apple-trees\r\nbrought from England blossom a fortnight sooner than the native ones. In\r\nour country the shrubs, that are brought a degree or two from the north,\r\nare observed to flourish better than those, which come from the south. The\r\nSiberian barley and cabbage are said to grow larger in this climate than\r\nthe similar more southern vegetables. And our hoards of roots, as of\r\npotatoes and onions, germinate with less heat in spring, after they have\r\nbeen accustomed to the winter's cold, than in autumn after the summer's\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nII. The stamens and pistils of flowers shew evident marks of sensibility,\r\nnot only from many of the stamens and some pistils approaching towards each\r\nother at the season of impregnation, but from many of them closing their\r\npetals and calyxes during the cold parts of the day. For this cannot be\r\nascribed to irritation, because cold means a defect of the stimulus of\r\nheat; but as the want of accustomed stimuli produces pain, as in coldness,\r\nhunger, and thirst of animals, these motions of vegetables in closing up\r\ntheir flowers must be ascribed to the disgreeable sensation, and not to the\r\nirritation of cold. Others close up their leaves during darkness, which,\r\nlike the former, cannot be owing to irritation, as the irritating material\r\nis withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the anthers in many flowers to the stigmas, and of the\r\npistils of some flowers to the anthers, must be ascribed to the passion of\r\nlove, and hence belongs to sensation, not to irritation.\r\n\r\nIII. That the vegetable world possesses some degree of voluntary powers,\r\nappears from their necessity to sleep, which we have shewn in Sect. XVIII.\r\nto consist in the temporary abolition of voluntary power. This voluntary\r\npower seems to be exerted in the circular movement of the tendrils of\r\nvines, and other climbing vegetables; or in the efforts to turn the upper\r\nsurface of their leaves, or their flowers to the light.\r\n\r\nIV. The associations of fibrous motions are observable in the vegetable\r\nworld, as well as in the animal. The divisions of the leaves of the\r\nsensitive plant have been accustomed to contract at the same time from the\r\nabsence of light; hence if by any other circumstance, as a slight stroke or\r\ninjury, one division is irritated into contraction, the neighbouring ones\r\ncontract also, from their motions being associated with those of the\r\nirritated part. So the various stamina of the class of syngenesia have been\r\naccustomed to contract together in the evening, and thence if you stimulate\r\none of them with a pin, according to the experiment of M. Colvolo, they all\r\ncontract from their acquired associations.\r\n\r\nTo evince that the collapsing of the sensitive plant is not owing to any\r\nmechanical vibrations propagated along the whole branch, when a single leaf\r\nis struck with the finger, a leaf of it was slit with sharp scissors, and\r\nsome seconds of time passed before the plant seemed sensible of the injury;\r\nand then the whole branch collapsed as far as the principal stem: this\r\nexperiment was repeated several times with the least possible impulse to\r\nthe plant.\r\n\r\nV. 1. For the numerous circumstances in which vegetable buds are analogous\r\nto animals, the reader is referred to the additional notes at the end of\r\nthe Botanic Garden, Part I. It is there shewn, that the roots of vegetables\r\nresemble the lacteal system of animals; the sap-vessels in the early\r\nspring, before their leaves expand, are analogous to the placental vessels\r\nof the foetus; that the leaves of land-plants resemble lungs, and those of\r\naquatic plants the gills of fish; that there are other systems of vessels\r\nresembling the vena portarum of quadrupeds, or the aorta of fish; that the\r\ndigestive power of vegetables is similar to that of animals converting the\r\nfluids, which they absorb, into sugar; that their seeds resemble the eggs\r\nof animals, and their buds and bulbs their viviparous offspring. And,\r\nlastly, that the anthers and stigmas are real animals, attached indeed to\r\ntheir parent tree like polypi or coral insects, but capable of spontaneous\r\nmotion; that they are affected with the passion of love, and furnished with\r\npowers of reproducing their species, and are fed with honey like the moths\r\nand butterflies, which plunder their nectaries. See Botanic Garden, Part I.\r\nadd. note XXXIX.\r\n\r\nThe male flowers of vallisneria approach still nearer to apparent\r\nanimality, as they detach themselves from the parent plant, and float on\r\nthe surface of the water to the female ones. Botanic Garden, Part II. Art.\r\nVallisneria. Other flowers of the classes of monecia and diecia, and\r\npolygamia, discharge the fecundating farina, which floating in the air is\r\ncarried to the stigma of the female flowers, and that at considerable\r\ndistances. Can this be effected by any specific attraction? or, like the\r\ndiffusion of the odorous particles of flowers, is it left to the currents\r\nof winds, and the accidental miscarriages of it counteracted by the\r\nquantity of its production?\r\n\r\n2. This leads us to a curious enquiry, whether vegetables have ideas of\r\nexternal things? As all our ideas are originally received by our senses,\r\nthe question may be changed to, whether vegetables possess any organs of\r\nsense? Certain it is, that they possess a sense of heat and cold, another\r\nof moisture and dryness, and another of light and darkness; for they close\r\ntheir petals occasionally from the presence of cold, moisture, or darkness.\r\nAnd it has been already shewn, that these actions cannot be performed\r\nsimply from irritation, because cold and darkness are negative quantities,\r\nand on that account sensation or volition are implied, and in consequence a\r\nsensorium or union of their nerves. So when we go into the light, we\r\ncontract the iris; not from any stimulus of the light on the fine muscles\r\nof the iris, but from its motions being associated with the sensation of\r\ntoo much light on the retina: which could not take place without a\r\nsensorium or center of union of the nerves of the iris with those of\r\nvision. See Botanic Garden, Part I. Canto 3. l. 440. note.\r\n\r\nBesides these organs of sense, which distinguish cold, moisture, and\r\ndarkness, the leaves of mimosa, and of dionæa, and of drosera, and the\r\nstamens of many flowers, as of the berbery, and the numerous class of\r\nsyngenesia, are sensible to mechanic impact, that is, they possess a sense\r\nof touch, as well as a common sensorium; by the medium of which their\r\nmuscles are excited into action. Lastly, in many flowers the anthers, when\r\nmature, approach the stigma, in others the female organ approaches to the\r\nmale. In a plant of collinsonia, a branch of which is now before me, the\r\ntwo yellow stamens are about three eights of an inch high, and diverge from\r\neach other, at an angle of about fifteen degrees, the purple style is half\r\nan inch high, and in some flowers is now applied to the stamen on the right\r\nhand, and in others to that of the left; and will, I suppose, change place\r\nto-morrow in those, where the anthers have not yet effused their powder.\r\n\r\nI ask, by what means are the anthers in many flowers, and stigmas in other\r\nflowers, directed to find their paramours? How do either of them know, that\r\nthe other exists in their vicinity? Is this curious kind of storge produced\r\nby mechanic attraction, or by the sensation of love? The latter opinion is\r\nsupported by the strongest analogy, because a reproduction of the species\r\nis the consequence; and then another organ of sense must be wanted to\r\ndirect these vegetable amourettes to find each other, one probably\r\nanalogous to our sense of smell, which in the animal world directs the\r\nnew-born infant to its source of nourishment, and they may thus possess a\r\nfaculty of perceiving as well as of producing odours.\r\n\r\nThus, besides a kind of taste at the extremities of their roots, similar to\r\nthat of the extremities of our lacteal vessels, for the purpose of\r\nselecting their proper food: and besides different kinds of irritability\r\nresiding in the various glands, which separate honey, wax, resin, and other\r\njuices from their blood; vegetable life seems to possess an organ of sense\r\nto distinguish the variations of heat, another to distinguish the varying\r\ndegrees of moisture, another of light, another of touch, and probably\r\nanother analogous to our sense of smell. To these must be added the\r\nindubitable evidence of their passion of love, and I think we may truly\r\nconclude, that they are furnished with a common sensorium belonging to each\r\nbud and that they must occasionally repeat those perceptions either in\r\ntheir dreams or waking hours, and consequently possess ideas of so many of\r\nthe properties of the external world, and of their own existence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

Philosophers have been much perplexed to understand, in what manner we\r\nbecome acquainted with the external world; insomuch that Dr. Berkly even\r\ndoubted its existence, from having observed (as he thought) that none of\r\nour ideas resemble their correspondent objects. Mr. Hume asserts, that our\r\nbelief depends on the greater distinctness or energy of our ideas from\r\nperception; and Mr. Reid has lately contended, that our belief of external\r\nobjects is an innate principle necessarily joined with our perceptions.\r\n\r\nSo true is the observation of the famous Malbranch, \"that our senses are\r\nnot given us to discover the essences of things, but to acquaint us with\r\nthe means of preserving our existence,\" (L. I. ch. v.) a melancholy\r\nreflection to philosophers!\r\n\r\nSome philosophers have divided all created beings into material and\r\nimmaterial: the former including all that part of being, which obeys the\r\nmechanic laws of action and reaction, but which can begin no motion of\r\nitself; the other is the cause of all motion, and is either termed the\r\npower of gravity, or of specific attraction, or the spirit of animation.\r\nThis immaterial agent is supposed to exist in or with matter, but to be\r\nquite distinct from it, and to be equally capable of existence, after the\r\nmatter, which now possesses it, is decomposed.\r\n\r\nNor is this theory ill supported by analogy, since heat, electricity, and\r\nmagnetism, can be given to or taken from a piece of iron; and must\r\ntherefore exist, whether separated from the metal, or combined with it.\r\nFrom a parity of reasoning, the spirit of animation, would appear to be\r\ncapable of existing as well separately from the body as with it.\r\n\r\nI beg to be understood, that I do not wish to dispute about words, and am\r\nready to allow, that the powers of gravity, specific attraction,\r\nelectricity, magnetism, and even the spirit of animation, may consist of\r\nmatter of a finer kind; and to believe, with St. Paul and Malbranch, that\r\nthe ultimate cause only of all motion is immaterial, that is God. St. Paul\r\nsays, \"in him we live and move, and have our being;\" and, in the 15th\r\nchapter to the Corinthians, distinguishes between the psyche or living\r\nspirit, and the pneuma or reviving spirit. By the words spirit of animation\r\nor sensorial power, I mean only that animal life, which mankind possesses\r\nin common with brutes, and in some degree even with vegetables, and leave\r\nthe consideration of the immortal part of us, which is the object of\r\nreligion, to those who treat of revelation.\r\n\r\nII. 1. _Of the Sense of Touch._\r\n\r\nThe first idea we become acquainted with, are those of the sense of touch;\r\nfor the foetus must experience some varieties of agitation, and exert some\r\nmuscular action, in the womb; and may with great probability be supposed\r\nthus to gain some ideas of its own figure, of that of the uterus, and of\r\nthe tenacity of the fluid, that surrounds it, (as appears from the facts\r\nmentioned in the succeeding Section upon Instinct.)\r\n\r\nMany of the organs of sense are confined to a small part of the body, as\r\nthe nostrils, ear, or eye, whilst the sense of touch is diffused over the\r\nwhole skin, but exists with a more exquisite degree of delicacy at the\r\nextremities of the fingers and thumbs, and in the lips. The sense of touch\r\nis thus very commodiously disposed for the purpose of encompassing smaller\r\nbodies, and for adapting itself to the inequalities of larger ones. The\r\nfigure of small bodies seems to be learnt by children by their lips as much\r\nas by their fingers; on which account they put every new object to their\r\nmouths, when they are satiated with food, as well as when they are hungry.\r\nAnd puppies seem to learn their ideas of figure principally by the lips in\r\ntheir mode of play.\r\n\r\nWe acquire our tangible ideas of objects either by the simple pressure of\r\nthis organ of touch against a solid body, or by moving our organ of touch\r\nalong the surface of it. In the former case we learn the length and breadth\r\nof the object by the quantity of our organ of touch, that is impressed by\r\nit: in the latter case we learn the length and breadth of objects by the\r\ncontinuance of their pressure on our moving organ of touch.\r\n\r\nIt is hence, that we are very slow in acquiring our tangible ideas, and\r\nvery slow in recollecting them; for if I now think of the tangible idea of\r\na cube, that is, if I think of its figure, and of the solidity of every\r\npart of that figure, I must conceive myself as passing my fingers over it,\r\nand seem in some measure to feel the idea, as I formerly did the\r\nimpression, at the ends of them, and am thus very slow in distinctly\r\nrecollecting it.\r\n\r\nWhen a body compresses any part of our sense of touch, what happens? First,\r\nthis part of our sensorium undergoes a mechanical compression, which is\r\ntermed a stimulus; secondly, an idea, or contraction of a part of the organ\r\nof sense is excited; thirdly, a motion of the central parts, or of the\r\nwhole sensorium, which is termed sensation, is produced; and these three\r\nconstitute the perception of solidity.\r\n\r\n2. _Of Figure, Motion, Time, Place, Space, Number._\r\n\r\nNo one will deny, that the medulla of the brain and nerves has a certain\r\nfigure; which, as it is diffused through nearly the whole of the body, must\r\nhave nearly the figure of that body. Now it follows, that the spirit of\r\nanimation, or living principle, as it occupies this medulla, and no other\r\npart, (which is evinced by a great variety of cruel experiments on living\r\nanimals,) it follows, that this spirit of animation has also the same\r\nfigure as the medulla above described. I appeal to common sense! the spirit\r\nof animation acts, Where does it act? It acts wherever there is the medulla\r\nabove mentioned; and that whether the limb is yet joined to a living\r\nanimal, or whether it be recently detached from it; as the heart of a viper\r\nor frog will renew its contractions, when pricked with a pin, for many\r\nminutes of time after its exsection from the body.--Does it act any where\r\nelse?--No; then it certainly exists in this part of space, and no where\r\nelse; that is, it hath figure; namely, the figure of the nervous system,\r\nwhich is nearly the figure of the body. When the idea of solidity is\r\nexcited, as above explained, a part of the extensive organ of touch is\r\ncompressed by some external body, and this part of the sensorium so\r\ncompressed exactly resembles _in figure_ the figure of the body that\r\ncompressed it. Hence, when we acquire the idea of solidity, we acquire at\r\nthe same time the idea of FIGURE; and this idea of figure, or motion of _a\r\npart_ of the organ of touch, exactly resembles _in its figure_ the figure\r\nof the body that occasions it; and thus exactly acquaints us with this\r\nproperty of the external world.\r\n\r\nNow, as the whole universe with all its parts possesses a certain form or\r\nfigure, if any part of it moves, that form or figure of the whole is\r\nvaried: hence, as MOTION is no other than a perpetual variation of figure,\r\nour idea of motion is also a real resemblance of the motion that produced\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt may be said in objection to this definition of motion, that an ivory\r\nglobe may revolve on its axis, and that here will be a motion without\r\nchange of figure. But the figure of the particle _x_ on one side of this\r\nglobe is not the _same_ figure as the figure of _y_ on the other side, any\r\nmore than the particles themselves are the same, though they are _similar_\r\nfigures; and hence they cannot change place with each other without\r\ndisturbing or changing the figure of the whole.\r\n\r\nOur idea of TIME is from the same source, but is more abstracted, as it\r\nincludes only the comparative velocities of these variations of figure;\r\nhence if it be asked, How long was this book in printing? it may be\r\nanswered, Whilst the sun was passing through Aries.\r\n\r\nOur idea of PLACE includes only the figure of a group of bodies, not the\r\nfigures of the bodies themselves. If it be asked where is Nottinghamshire,\r\nthe answer is, it is surrounded by Derbyshire, Lincolnshire and\r\nLeicestershire; hence place is our idea of the figure of one body\r\nsurrounded by the figures of other bodies.\r\n\r\nThe idea of SPACE is a more abstracted idea of place excluding the group of\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nThe idea of NUMBER includes only the particular arrangements, or\r\ndistributions of a group of bodies, and is therefore only a more abstracted\r\nidea of the parts of the figure of the group of bodies; thus when I say\r\nEngland is divided into forty counties, I only speak of certain divisions\r\nof its figure.\r\n\r\nHence arises the certainty of the mathematical sciences, as they explain\r\nthese properties of bodies, which are exactly resembled by our ideas of\r\nthem, whilst we are obliged to collect almost all our other knowledge from\r\nexperiment; that is, by observing the effects exerted by one body upon\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n3. _Of the Penetrability of Matter._\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of two bodies existing together in the same space cannot\r\nbe deduced from our idea of solidity, or of figure. As soon as we perceive\r\nthe motions of objects that surround us, and learn that we possess a power\r\nto move our own bodies, we experience, that those objects, which excite in\r\nus the idea of solidity and of figure, oppose this voluntary movement of\r\nour own organs; as whilst I endeavour to compress between my hands an ivory\r\nball into a spheroid. And we are hence taught by experience, that our own\r\nbody and those, which we touch, cannot exist in the same part of space.\r\n\r\nBut this by no means demonstrates, that no two bodies can exist together in\r\nthe same part of space. Galilæo in the preface to his works seems to be of\r\nopinion, that matter is not impenetrable; Mr. Michel, and Mr. Boscowich in\r\nhis Theoria. Philos. Natur. have espoused this hypothesis: which has been\r\nlately published by Dr. Priestley, to whom the world is much indebted for\r\nso many important discoveries in science. (Hist. of Light and Colours, p.\r\n391.) The uninterrupted passage of light through transparent bodies, of the\r\nelectric æther through metallic and aqueous bodies, and of the magnetic\r\neffluvia through all bodies, would seem to give some probability to this\r\nopinion. Hence it appears, that beings may exist without possessing the\r\nproperty of solidity, as well as they can exist without possessing the\r\nproperties, which excite our smell or taste, and can thence occupy space\r\nwithout detruding other bodies from it; but we cannot become acquainted\r\nwith such beings by our sense of touch, any more than we can with odours or\r\nflavours without our senses of smell and taste.\r\n\r\nBut that any being can exist without existing in space, is to my ideas\r\nutterly incomprehensible. My appeal is to common sense. _To be_ implies a\r\nwhen and a where; the one is comparing it with the motions of other beings,\r\nand the other with their situations.\r\n\r\nIf there was but one object, as the whole creation may be considered as one\r\nobject, then I cannot ask where it exists? for there are no other objects\r\nto compare its situation with. Hence if any one denies, that a being exists\r\nin space, he denies, that there are any other beings but that one; for to\r\nanswer the question, \"Where does it exist?\" is only to mention the\r\nsituation of the objects that surround it.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner if it be asked--\"When does a being exist?\" The answer\r\nonly specifies the successive motions either of itself, or of other bodies;\r\nhence to say, a body exists not in time, is to say, that there is, or was,\r\nno motion in the world.\r\n\r\n4. _Of the Spirit of Animation._\r\n\r\nBut though there may exist beings in the universe, that have not the\r\nproperty of solidity; that is, which can possess any part of space, at the\r\nsame time that it is occupied by other bodies; yet there may be other\r\nbeings, that can assume this property of solidity, or disrobe themselves of\r\nit occasionally, as we are taught of spirits, and of angels; and it would\r\nseem, that THE SPIRIT OF ANIMATION must be endued with this property,\r\notherwise how could it occasionally give motion to the limbs of\r\nanimals?--or be itself stimulated into motion by the obtrusions of\r\nsurrounding bodies, as of light, or odour?\r\n\r\nIf the spirit of animation was always necessarily penetrable, it could not\r\ninfluence or be influenced by the solidity of common matter; they would\r\nexist together, but could not detrude each other from the part of space,\r\nwhere they exist; that is, they could not communicate motion to each other.\r\n_No two things can influence or affect each other, which have not some\r\nproperty common to both of them_; for to influence or affect another body\r\nis to give or communicate some property to it, that it had not before; but\r\nhow can one body give that to another, which it does not possess\r\nitself?--The words imply, that they must agree in having the power or\r\nfaculty of possessing some common property. Thus if one body removes\r\nanother from the part of space, that it possesses, it must have the power\r\nof occupying that space itself: and if one body communicates heat or motion\r\nto another, it follows, that they have alike the property of possessing\r\nheat or motion.\r\n\r\nHence the spirit of animation at the time it communicates or receives\r\nmotion from solid bodies, must itself possess some property of solidity.\r\nAnd in consequence at the time it receives other kinds of motion from\r\nlight, it must possess that property, which light possesses, to communicate\r\nthat kind of motion; and for which no language has a name, unless it may be\r\ntermed Visibility. And at the time it is stimulated into other kinds of\r\nanimal motion by the particles of sapid and odorous bodies affecting the\r\nsenses of taste and smell, it must resemble these particles of flavour, and\r\nof odour, in possessing some similar or correspondent property; and for\r\nwhich language has no name, unless we may use the words Saporosity and\r\nOdorosity for those common properties, which are possessed by our organs of\r\ntaste and smell, and by the particles of sapid and odorous bodies; as the\r\nwords Tangibility and Audibility may express the common property possessed\r\nby our organs of touch, and of hearing, and by the solid bodies, or their\r\nvibrations, which affect those organs.\r\n\r\n5. Finally, though the figures of bodies are in truth resembled by the\r\nfigure of the part of the organ of touch, which is stimulated into motion;\r\nand that organ resembles the solid body, which stimulates it, in its\r\nproperty of solidity; and though the sense of hearing resembles the\r\nvibrations of external bodies in its capability of being stimulated into\r\nmotion by those vibrations; and though our other organs of sense resemble\r\nthe bodies, that stimulate them, in their capability of being stimulated by\r\nthem; and we hence become acquainted with these properties of the external\r\nworld; yet as we can repeat all these motions of our organs of sense by the\r\nefforts of volition, or in consequence of the sensation of pleasure or\r\npain, or by their association with other fibrous motions, as happens in our\r\nreveries or in sleep, there would still appear to be some difficulty in\r\ndemonstrating the existence of any thing external to us.\r\n\r\nIn our dreams we cannot determine this circumstance, because our power of\r\nvolition is suspended, and the stimuli of external objects are excluded;\r\nbut in our waking hours we can compare our ideas belonging to one sense\r\nwith those belonging to another, and can thus distinguish the ideas\r\noccasioned by irritation from those excited by sensation, volition, or\r\nassociation. Thus if the idea of the sweetness of sugar should be excited\r\nin our dreams, the whiteness and hardness of it occur at the same time by\r\nassociation; and we believe a material lump of sugar present before us. But\r\nif, in our waking hours, the idea of the sweetness of sugar occurs to us,\r\nthe stimuli of surrounding objects, as the edge of the table, on which we\r\npress, or green colour of the grass, on which we tread, prevent the other\r\nideas of the hardness and whiteness of the sugar from being exerted by\r\nassociation. Or if they should occur, we voluntarily compare them with the\r\nirritative ideas of the table or grass above mentioned, and detect their\r\nfallacy. We can thus distinguish the ideas caused by the stimuli of\r\nexternal objects from those, which are introduced by association,\r\nsensation, or volition; and during our waking hours can thus acquire a\r\nknowledge of the external world. Which nevertheless we cannot do in our\r\ndreams, because we have neither perceptions of external bodies, nor the\r\npower of volition to enable us to compare them with the ideas of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nIII. _Of Vision._\r\n\r\nOur eyes observe a difference of colour, or of shade, in the prominences\r\nand depressions of objects, and that those shades uniformly vary, when the\r\nsense of touch observes any variation. Hence when the retina becomes\r\nstimulated by colours or shades of light in a certain form, as in a\r\ncircular spot; we know by experience, that this is a sign, that a tangible\r\nbody is before us; and that its figure is resembled by the miniature figure\r\nof the part of the organ of vision, that is thus stimulated.\r\n\r\nHere whilst the stimulated part of the retina resembles exactly the visible\r\nfigure of the whole in miniature, the various kinds of stimuli from\r\ndifferent colours mark the visible figures of the minuter parts; and by\r\nhabit we instantly recall the tangible figures.\r\n\r\nThus when a tree is the object of sight, a part of the retina resembling a\r\nflat branching figure is stimulated by various shades of colours; but it is\r\nby suggestion, that the gibbosity of the tree, and the moss, that fringes\r\nits trunk, appear before us. These are ideas of suggestion, which we feel\r\nor attend to, associated with the motions of the retina, or irritative\r\nideas, which we do not attend to.\r\n\r\nSo that though our visible ideas resemble in miniature the outline of the\r\nfigure of coloured bodies, in other respects they serve only as a language,\r\nwhich by acquired associations introduce the tangible ideas of bodies.\r\nHence it is, that this sense is so readily deceived by the art of the\r\npainter to our amusement and instruction. The reader will find much very\r\ncurious knowledge on this subject in Bishop Berkley's Essay on Vision, a\r\nwork of great ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe immediate object however of the sense of vision is light; this fluid,\r\nthough its velocity is so great, appears to have no perceptible mechanical\r\nimpulse, as was mentioned in the third Section, but seems to stimulate the\r\nretina into animal motion by its transmission through this part of the\r\nsensorium: for though the eyes of cats or other animals appear luminous in\r\nobscure places; yet it is probable, that none of the light, which falls on\r\nthe retina, is reflected from it, but adheres to or enters into combination\r\nwith the choroide coat behind it.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the particles of light with opake bodies, and therefore\r\nwith the choroide coat of the eye, is evinced from the heat, which is given\r\nout, as in other chemical combinations. For the sunbeams communicate no\r\nheat in their passage through transparent bodies, with which they do not\r\ncombine, as the air continues cool even in the focus of the largest\r\nburning-glasses, which in a moment vitrifies a particle of opaque matter.\r\n\r\nIV. _Of the Organ of Hearing._\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed, that the tympanum of the ear vibrates\r\nmechanically, when exposed to audible sounds, like the strings of one\r\nmusical instrument, when the same notes are struck upon another. Nor is\r\nthis opinion improbable, as the muscles and cartilages of the larynx are\r\nemployed in producing variety of tones by mechanical vibration: so the\r\nmuscles and bones of the ear seem adapted to increase or diminish the\r\ntension of the tympanum for the purposes of similar mechanical vibrations.\r\n\r\nBut it appears from dissection, that the tympanum is not the immediate\r\norgan of hearing, but that like the humours and cornea of the eye, it is\r\nonly of use to prepare the object for the immediate organ. For the portio\r\nmollis of the auditory nerve is not spread upon the tympanum, but upon the\r\nvestibulum, and cochlea, and semicircular canals of the ear; while between\r\nthe tympanum and the expansion of the auditory nerve the cavity is said by\r\nDr. Cotunnus and Dr. Meckel to be filled with water; as they had frequently\r\nobserved by freezing the heads of dead animals before they dissected them;\r\nand water being a more dense fluid than air is much better adapted to the\r\npropagation of vibrations. We may add, that even the external opening of\r\nthe ear is not absolutely necessary for the perception of sound: for some\r\npeople, who from these defects would have been completely deaf, have\r\ndistinguished acute or grave sounds by the tremours of a stick held between\r\ntheir teeth propagated along the bones of the head, (Haller. Phys. T. V. p.\r\n295).\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that the immediate organ of hearing is not affected by\r\nthe particles of the air themselves, but is stimulated into animal motion\r\nby the vibrations of them. And it is probable from the loose bones, which\r\nare found in the heads of some fishes, that the vibrations of water are\r\nsensible to the inhabitants of that element by a similar organ.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the atmosphere, which we become acquainted with by the sense\r\nof touch, are combined with its solidity, weight, or vis intertiæ; whereas\r\nthose, that are perceived by this organ, depend alone on its elasticity.\r\nBut though the vibration of the air is the immediate object of the sense of\r\nhearing, yet the ideas, we receive by this sense, like those received from\r\nlight, are only as a language, which by acquired associations acquaints us\r\nwith those motions of tangible bodies, which depend on their elasticity;\r\nand which we had before learned by our sense of touch.\r\n\r\nV. _Of Smell and of Taste._\r\n\r\nThe objects of smell are dissolved in the fluid atmosphere, and those of\r\ntaste in the saliva, or other aqueous fluid, for the better diffusing them\r\non their respective organs, which seem to be stimulated into animal motion\r\nperhaps by the chemical affinities of these particles, which constitute the\r\nsapidity and odorosity of bodies with the nerves of sense, which perceive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Volta has lately observed a curious circumstance relative to our sense\r\nof taste. If a bit of clean lead and a bit of clean silver be separately\r\napplied to the tongue and palate no taste is perceived; but by applying\r\nthem in contact in respect to the parts out of the mouth, and nearly so in\r\nrespect to the parts, which are immediately applied to the tongue and\r\npalate, a saline or acidulous taste is perceived, as of a fluid like a\r\nstream of electricity passing from one of them to the other. This new\r\napplication of the sense of taste deserves further investigation, as it may\r\nacquaint us with new properties of matter.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiments above mentioned of Galvani, Volta, Fowler, and others,\r\nit appears, that a plate of zinc and a plate of silver have greater effect\r\nthan lead and silver. If one edge of a plate of silver about the size of\r\nhalf a crown-piece be placed upon the tongue, and one edge of a plate of\r\nzinc about the same size beneath the tongue, and if their opposite edges\r\nare then brought into contact before the point of the tongue, a taste is\r\nperceived at the moment of their coming into contact; secondly, if one of\r\nthe above plates be put between the upper lip and the gum of the\r\nfore-teeth, and the other be placed under the tongue, and their exterior\r\nedges be then brought into contact in a darkish room, a flash of light is\r\nperceived in the eyes.\r\n\r\nThese effects I imagine only shew the sensibility of our nerves of sense to\r\nvery small quantities of the electric fluid, as it passes through them; for\r\nI suppose these sensations are occasioned by slight electric shocks\r\nproduced in the following manner. By the experiments published by Mr.\r\nBennet, with his ingenious doubler of electricity, which is the greatest\r\ndiscovery made in that science since the coated jar, and the eduction of\r\nlightning from the skies, it appears that zinc was always found minus, and\r\nsilver was always found plus, when both of them were in their separate\r\nstate. Hence, when they are placed in the manner above described, as soon\r\nas their exterior edges come nearly into contact, so near as to have an\r\nextremely thin plate of air between them, that plate of air becomes charged\r\nin the same manner as a plate of coated glass; and is at the same instant\r\ndischarged through the nerves of taste or of sight, and gives the\r\nsensations, as above described, of light or of saporocity; and only shews\r\nthe great sensibility of these organs of sense to the stimulus of the\r\nelectric fluid in suddenly passing through them.\r\n\r\nVI. _Of the Sense of Heat._\r\n\r\nThere are many experiments in chemical writers, that evince the existence\r\nof heat as a fluid element, which covers and pervades all bodies, and is\r\nattracted by the solutions of some of them, and is detruded from the\r\ncombination of others. Thus from the combinations of metals with acids, and\r\nfrom those combinations of animal fluids, which are termed secretions, this\r\nfluid matter of heat is given out amongst the neighbouring bodies; and in\r\nthe solutions of salts in water, or of water in air, it is absorbed from\r\nthe bodies, that surround them; whilst in its facility in passing through\r\nmetallic bodies, and its difficulty in pervading resins and glass, it\r\nresembles the properties of the electric aura; and is like that excited by\r\nfriction, and seems like that to gravitate amongst other bodies in its\r\nuncombined state, and to find its equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThere is no circumstance of more consequence in the animal economy than a\r\ndue proportion of this fluid of heat; for the digestion of our nutriment in\r\nthe stomach and bowels, and the proper qualities of all our secreted\r\nfluids, as they are produced or prepared partly by animal and partly by\r\nchemical processes, depend much on the quantity of heat; the excess of\r\nwhich, or its deficiency, alike gives us pain, and induces us to avoid the\r\ncircumstances that occasion them. And in this the perception of heat\r\nessentially differs from the perceptions of the sense of touch, as we\r\nreceive pain from too great pressure of solid bodies, but none from the\r\nabsence of it. It is hence probable, that nature has provided us with a set\r\nof nerves for the perception of this fluid, which anatomists have not yet\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nThere may be some difficulty in the proof of this assertion; if we look at\r\na hot fire, we experience no pain of the optic nerve, though the heat along\r\nwith the light must be concentrated upon it. Nor does warm water or warm\r\noil poured into the ear give pain to the organ of hearing; and hence as\r\nthese organs of sense do not perceive small excesses or deficiences of\r\nheat; and as heat has no greater analogy to the solidity or to the figures\r\nof bodies, than it has to their colours or vibrations; there seems no\r\nsufficient reason for our ascribing the perception of heat and cold to the\r\nsense of touch; to which it has generally been attributed, either because\r\nit is diffused beneath the whole skin like the sense of touch, or owing to\r\nthe inaccuracy of our observations, or the defect of our languages.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance would induce us to believe, that the\r\nperceptions of heat and cold do not belong to the organ of touch; since the\r\nteeth, which are the least adapted for the perceptions of solidity or\r\nfigure, are the most sensible to heat or cold; whence we are forewarned\r\nfrom swallowing those materials, whose degree of coldness or of heat would\r\ninjure our stomachs.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter of Dr. R.W. Darwin, of\r\nShrewsbury, when he was a student at Edinburgh. \"I made an experiment\r\nyesterday in our hospital, which much favours your opinion, that the\r\nsensation of heat and of touch depend on different sets of nerves. A man\r\nwho had lately recovered from a fever, and was still weak, was seized with\r\nviolent cramps in his legs and feet; which were removed by opiates, except\r\nthat one of his feet remained insensible. Mr. Ewart pricked him with a pin\r\nin five or six places, and the patient declared he did not feel it in the\r\nleast, nor was he sensible of a very smart pinch. I then held a red-hot\r\npoker at some distance, and brought it gradually nearer till it came within\r\nthree inches, when he asserted that he felt it quite distinctly. I suppose\r\nsome violent irritation on the nerves of touch had caused the cramps, and\r\nhad left them paralytic; while the nerves of heat, having suffered no\r\nincreased stimulus, retained their irritability.\"\r\n\r\nAdd to this, that the lungs, though easily stimulated into inflammation,\r\nare not sensible to heat. See Class. III. 1. 1. 10.\r\n\r\nVII. _Of the Sense of Extension._\r\n\r\nThe organ of touch is properly the sense of pressure, but the muscular\r\nfibres themselves constitute the organ of sense, that feels extension. The\r\nsense of pressure is always attended with the ideas of the figure and\r\nsolidity of the object, neither of which accompany our perception of\r\nextension. The whole set of muscles, whether they are hollow ones, as the\r\nheart, arteries, and intestines, or longitudinal ones attached to bones,\r\ncontract themselves, whenever they are stimulated by forcible elongation;\r\nand it is observable, that the white muscles, which constitute the arterial\r\nsystem, seem to be excited into contraction from no other kinds of\r\nstimulus, according to the experiments of Haller. And hence the violent\r\npain in some inflammations, as in the paronychia, obtains immediate relief\r\nby cutting the membrane, that was stretched by the tumour of the subjacent\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nHence the whole muscular system may be considered as one organ of sense,\r\nand the various attitudes of the body, as ideas belonging to this organ, of\r\nmany of which we are hourly conscious, while many others, like the\r\nirritative ideas of the other senses, are performed without our attention.\r\n\r\nWhen the muscles of the heart cease to act, the refluent blood again\r\ndistends or elongates them; and thus irritated they contract as before. The\r\nsame happens to the arterial system, and I suppose to the capillaries,\r\nintestines, and various glands of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen the quantity of urine, or of excrement, distends the bladder, or\r\nrectum, those parts contract, and exclude their contents, and many other\r\nmuscles by association act along with them; but if these evacuations are\r\nnot soon complied with, pain is produced by a little further extension of\r\nthe muscular fibres: a similar pain is caused in the muscles, when a limb\r\nis much extended for the reduction of dislocated bones; and in the\r\npunishment of the rack: and in the painful cramps of the calf of the leg,\r\nor of other muscles, for a greater degree of contraction of a muscle, than\r\nthe movement of the two bones, to which its ends are affixed, will admit\r\nof, must give similar pain to that, which is produced by extending it\r\nbeyond its due length. And the pain from punctures or incisions arises from\r\nthe distention of the fibres, as the knife passes through them; for it\r\nnearly ceases as soon as the division is completed.\r\n\r\nAll these motions of the muscles, that are thus naturally excited by the\r\nstimulus of distending bodies, are also liable to be called into strong\r\naction by their catenation, with the irritations or sensations produced by\r\nthe momentum of the progressive particles of blood in the arteries, as in\r\ninflammatory fevers, or by acrid substances on other sensible organs, as in\r\nthe strangury, or tenesmus, or cholera.\r\n\r\nWe shall conclude this account of the sense of extension by observing, that\r\nthe want of its object is attended with a disagreeable sensation, as well\r\nas the excess of it. In those hollow muscles, which have been accustomed to\r\nit, this disagreeable sensation is called faintness, emptiness, and\r\nsinking; and, when it arises to a certain degree, is attended with syncope,\r\nor a total quiescence of all motions, but the internal irritative ones, as\r\nhappens from sudden loss of blood, or in the operation of tapping in the\r\ndropsy.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Of the Appetites of Hunger, Thirst, Heat, Extension, the want of\r\nfresh Air, animal Love, and the Suckling of Children._\r\n\r\nHunger is most probably perceived by those numerous ramifications of nerves\r\nthat are seen about the upper opening of the stomach; and thirst by the\r\nnerves about the fauces, and the top of the gula. The ideas of these senses\r\nare few in the generality of mankind, but are more numerous in those, who\r\nby disease, or indulgence, desire particular kinds of foods or liquids.\r\n\r\nA sense of heat has already been spoken of, which may with propriety be\r\ncalled an appetite, as we painfully desire it, when it is deficient in\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nThe sense of extension may be ranked amongst these appetites, since the\r\ndeficiency of its object gives disagreeable sensation; when this happens in\r\nthe arterial system, it is called faintness, and seems to bear some analogy\r\nto hunger and to cold; which like it are attended with emptiness of a part\r\nof the vascular system.\r\n\r\nThe sense of want of fresh air has not been attended to, but is as distinct\r\nas the others, and the first perhaps that we experience after our nativity;\r\nfrom the want of the object of this sense many diseases are produced, as\r\nthe jail-fever, plague, and other epidemic maladies. Animal love is another\r\nappetite, which occurs later in life, and the females of lactiferous\r\nanimals have another natural inlet of pleasure or pain from the suckling\r\ntheir offspring. The want of which either owing to the death of their\r\nprogeny, or to the fashion of their country, has been fatal to many of the\r\nsex. The males have also pectoral glands, which are frequently turgid with\r\na thin milk at their nativity, and are furnished with nipples, which erect\r\non titillation like those of the female; but which seem now to be of no\r\nfurther use, owing perhaps to some change which these animals have\r\nundergone in the gradual progression of the formation of the earth, and of\r\nall that it inhabit.\r\n\r\nThese seven last mentioned senses may properly be termed appetites, as they\r\ndiffer from those of touch, sight, hearing, taste, and smell, in this\r\nrespect; that they are affected with pain as well by the defect of their\r\nobjects as by the excess of them, which is not so in the latter. Thus cold\r\nand hunger give us pain, as well as an excess of heat or satiety; but it is\r\nnot so with darkness and silence.\r\n\r\nIX. Before we conclude this Section on the organs of sense, we must\r\nobserve, that, as far as we know, there are many more senses, than have\r\nbeen here mentioned, as every gland seems to be influenced to separate from\r\nthe blood, or to absorb from the cavities of the body, or from the\r\natmosphere, its appropriated fluid, by the stimulus of that fluid on the\r\nliving gland; and not by mechanical capillary absorption, nor by chemical\r\naffinity. Hence it appears, that each of these glands must have a peculiar\r\norgan to perceive these irritations, but as these irritations are not\r\nsucceeded by sensation, they have not acquired the names of senses.\r\n\r\nHowever when these glands are excited into motions stronger than usual,\r\neither by the acrimony of their fluids, or by their own irritability being\r\nmuch increased, then the sensation of pain is produced in them as in all\r\nthe other senses of the body; and these pains are all of different kinds,\r\nand hence the glands at this time really become each a different organ of\r\nsense, though these different kinds of pain have acquired no names.\r\n\r\nThus a great excess of light does not give the idea of light but of pain;\r\nas in forcibly opening the eye when it is much inflamed. The great excess\r\nof pressure or distention, as when the point of a pin is pressed upon our\r\nskin, produces pain, (and when this pain of the sense of distention is\r\nslighter, it is termed itching, or tickling), without any idea of solidity\r\nor of figure: an excess of heat produces smarting, of cold another kind of\r\npain; it is probable by this sense of heat the pain produced by caustic\r\nbodies is perceived, and of electricity, as all these are fluids, that\r\npermeate, distend, or decompose the parts that feel them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.\r\n\r\nOF THE CLASSES OF IDEAS.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Ideas received in tribes._ 2. _We combine them further, or\r\n    abstract from these tribes._ 3. _Complex ideas._ 4. _Compounded ideas._\r\n    5. _Simple ideas, modes, substances, relations, general ideas._ 6.\r\n    _Ideas of reflexion._ 7. _Memory and imagination imperfectly defined.\r\n    Ideal presence.

As the constituent elements of the material world are only\r\nperceptible to our organs of sense in a state of combination; it follows,\r\nthat the ideas or sensual motions excited by them, are never received\r\nsingly, but ever with a greater or less degree of combination. So the\r\ncolours of bodies or their hardnesses occur with their figures: every smell\r\nand taste has its degree of pungency as well as its peculiar flavour: and\r\neach note in music is combined with the tone of some instrument. It appears\r\nfrom hence, that we can be sensible of a number of ideas at the same time,\r\nsuch as the whiteness, hardness, and coldness, of a snow-ball, and can\r\nexperience at the same time many irritative ideas of surrounding bodies,\r\nwhich we do not attend to, as mentioned in Section VII. 3. 2. But those\r\nideas which belong to the same sense, seem to be more easily combined into\r\nsynchronous tribes, than those which were not received by the same sense,\r\nas we can more easily think of the whiteness and figure of a lump of sugar\r\nat the same time, than the whiteness and sweetness of it.\r\n\r\n2. As these ideas, or sensual motions, are thus excited with greater or\r\nless degrees of combination; so we have a power, when we repeat them either\r\nby our volition or sensation, to increase or diminish this degree of\r\ncombination, that is, to form compounded ideas from those, which were more\r\nsimple; and abstract ones from those, which were more complex, when they\r\nwere first excited; that is, we can repeat a part or the whole of those\r\nsensual motions, which did constitute our ideas of perception; and the\r\nrepetition of which now constitutes our ideas of recollection, or of\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n3. Those ideas, which we repeat without change of the quantity of that\r\ncombination, with which we first received them, are called complex ideas,\r\nas when you recollect Westminster Abbey, or the planet Saturn: but it must\r\nbe observed, that these complex ideas, thus re-excited by volition,\r\nsensation, or association, are seldom perfect copies of their correspondent\r\nperceptions, except in our dreams, where other external objects do not\r\ndetract our attention.\r\n\r\n4. Those ideas, which are more complex than the natural objects that first\r\nexcited them, have been called compounded ideas, as when we think of a\r\nsphinx, or griffin.\r\n\r\n5. And those that are less complex than the correspondent natural objects,\r\nhave been termed abstracted ideas: thus sweetness, and whiteness, and\r\nsolidity, are received at the same time from a lump of sugar, yet I can\r\nrecollect any of these qualities without thinking of the others, that were\r\nexcited along with them.\r\n\r\nWhen ideas are so far abstracted as in the above example, they have been\r\ntermed simple by the writers of metaphysics, and seem indeed to be more\r\ncomplete repetitions of the ideas or sensual motions, originally excited by\r\nexternal objects.\r\n\r\nOther classes of these ideas, where the abstraction has not been so great,\r\nhave been termed, by Mr. Locke, modes, substances, and relations, but they\r\nseem only to differ in their degree of abstraction from the complex ideas\r\nthat were at first excited; for as these complex or natural ideas are\r\nthemselves imperfect copies of their correspondent perceptions, so these\r\nabstract or general ideas are only still more imperfect copies of the same\r\nperceptions. Thus when I have seen an object but once, as a rhinoceros, my\r\nabstract idea of this animal is the same as my complex one. I may think\r\nmore or less distinctly of a rhinoceros, but it is the very rhinoceros that\r\nI saw, or some part or property of him, which recurs to my mind.\r\n\r\nBut when any class of complex objects becomes the subject of conversation,\r\nof which I have seen many individuals, as a castle or an army, some\r\nproperty or circumstance belonging to it is peculiarly alluded to; and then\r\nI feel in my own mind, that my abstract idea of this complex object is only\r\nan idea of that part, property, or attitude of it, that employs the present\r\nconversation, and varies with every sentence that is spoken concerning it.\r\nSo if any one should say, \"one may sit upon a horse safer than on a camel,\"\r\nmy abstract idea of the two animals includes only an outline of the level\r\nback of the one, and the gibbosity on the back of the other. What noise is\r\nthat in the street?--Some horses trotting over the pavement. Here my idea\r\nof the horses includes principally the shape and motion of their legs. So\r\nalso the abstract ideas of goodness and courage are still more imperfect\r\nrepresentations of the objects they were received from; for here we\r\nabstract the material parts, and recollect only the qualities.\r\n\r\nThus we abstract so much from some of our complex ideas, that at length it\r\nbecomes difficult to determine of what perception they partake; and in many\r\ninstances our idea seems to be no other than of the sound or letters of the\r\nword, that stands for the collective tribe, of which we are said to have an\r\nabstracted idea, as noun, verb, chimæra, apparition.\r\n\r\n6. Ideas have been divided into those of perception and those of\r\nreflection, but as whatever is perceived must be external to the organ that\r\nperceives it, all our ideas must originally be ideas of perception.\r\n\r\n7. Others have divided our ideas into those of memory, and those of\r\nimagination; they have said that a recollection of ideas in the order they\r\nwere received constitutes memory, and without that order imagination; but\r\nall the ideas of imagination, excepting the few that are termed simple\r\nideas, are parts of trains or tribes in the order they were received; as if\r\nI think of a sphinx, or a griffin, the fair face, bosom, wings, claws,\r\ntail, are all complex ideas in the order they were received: and it behoves\r\nthe writers, who adhere to this definition, to determine, how small the\r\ntrains must be, that shall be called imagination; and how great those, that\r\nshall be called memory.\r\n\r\nOthers have thought that the ideas of memory have a greater vivacity than\r\nthose of imagination: but the ideas of a person in sleep, or in a waking\r\nreverie, where the trains connected with sensation are uninterrupted, are\r\nmore vivid and distinct than those of memory, so that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished by this criterion.\r\n\r\nThe very ingenious author of the Elements of Criticism has described what\r\nhe conceives to be a species of memory, and calls it ideal presence; but\r\nthe instances he produces are the reveries of sensation, and are therefore\r\nin truth connections of the imagination, though they are recalled in the\r\norder they were received.\r\n\r\nThe ideas connected by association are in common discourse attributed to\r\nmemory, as we talk of memorandum-rings, and tie a knot on our handkerchiefs\r\nto bring something into our minds at a distance of time. And a school-boy,\r\nwho can repeat a thousand unmeaning lines in Lilly's Grammar, is said to\r\nhave a good memory. But these have been already shewn to belong to the\r\nclass of association; and are termed ideas of suggestion.\r\n\r\nII. Lastly, the method already explained of classing ideas into those\r\nexcited by irritation, sensation, volition, or association, we hope will be\r\nfound more convenient both for explaining the operations of the mind, and\r\nfor comparing them with those of the body; and for the illustration and the\r\ncure of the diseases of both, and which we shall here recapitulate.\r\n\r\n1. Irritative ideas are those, which are preceded by irritation, which is\r\nexcited by objects external to the organs of sense: as the idea of that\r\ntree, which either I attend to, or which I shun in walking near it without\r\nattention. In the former case it is termed perception, in the latter it is\r\ntermed simply an irritative idea.\r\n\r\n2. Sensitive ideas are those, which are preceded by the sensation of\r\npleasure or pain; as the ideas, which constitute our dreams or reveries,\r\nthis is called imagination.\r\n\r\n3. Voluntary ideas are those, which are preceded by voluntary exertion, as\r\nwhen I repeat the alphabet backwards: this is called recollection.\r\n\r\n4. Associate ideas are those, which are preceded by other ideas or muscular\r\nmotions, as when we think over or repeat the alphabet by rote in its usual\r\norder; or sing a tune we are accustomed to; this is called suggestion.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Perceptions signify those ideas, which are preceded by irritation\r\nand succeeded by the sensation of pleasure or pain, for whatever excites\r\nour attention interests us; that is, it is accompanied with, pleasure or\r\npain; however slight may be the degree or quantity of either of them.\r\n\r\nThe word memory includes two classes of ideas, either those which, are\r\npreceded by voluntary exertion, or those which are suggested by their\r\nassociations with other ideas.\r\n\r\n2. Reasoning is that operation of the sensorium, by which we excite two or\r\nmany tribes of ideas; and then re-excite the ideas, in which they differ,\r\nor correspond. If we determine this difference, it is called judgment; if\r\nwe in vain endeavour to determine it, it is called doubting.\r\n\r\nIf we re-excited the ideas, in which they differ, it is called\r\ndistinguishing. If we re-excite those in which they correspond, it is\r\ncalled comparing.\r\n\r\n3. Invention is an operation of the sensorium, by which we voluntarily\r\ncontinue to excite one train of ideas, suppose the design of raising water\r\nby a machine; and at the same time attend to all other ideas, which are\r\nconnected with this by every kind of catenation; and combine or separate\r\nthem voluntarily for the purpose of obtaining some end.\r\n\r\nFor we can create nothing new, we can only combine or separate the ideas,\r\nwhich we have already received by our perceptions: thus if I wish to\r\nrepresent a monster, I call to my mind the ideas of every thing\r\ndisagreeable and horrible, and combine the nastiness and gluttony of a hog,\r\nthe stupidity and obstinacy of an ass, with the fur and awkwardness of a\r\nbear, and call the new combination Caliban. Yet such a monster may exist in\r\nnature, as all his attributes are parts of nature. So when I wish to\r\nrepresent every thing, that is excellent, and amiable; when I combine\r\nbenevolence with cheerfulness, wisdom, knowledge, taste, wit, beauty of\r\nperson, and elegance of manners, and associate them in one lady as a\r\npattern to the world, it is called invention; yet such a person may\r\nexist,--such a person does exist!--It is ---- ----, who is as much a\r\nmonster as Caliban.\r\n\r\n4. In respect to consciousness, we are only conscious of our existence,\r\nwhen we think about it; as we only perceive the lapse of time, when we\r\nattend to it; when we are busied about other objects, neither the lapse of\r\ntime nor the consciousness of our own existence can occupy our attention.\r\nHence, when we think of our own existence, we only excite abstracted or\r\nreflex ideas (as they are termed), of our principal pleasures or pains, of\r\nour desires or aversions, or of the figure, solidity, colour, or other\r\nproperties of our bodies, and call that act of the sensorium a\r\nconsciousness of our existence. Some philosopher, I believe it is Des\r\nCartes, has said, \"I think, therefore I exist.\" But this is not right\r\nreasoning, because thinking is a mode of existence; and it is thence only\r\nsaying, \"I exist, therefore I exist.\" For there are three modes of\r\nexistence, or in the language of grammarians three kinds of verbs. First,\r\nsimply I am, or exist. Secondly, I am acting, or exist in a state of\r\nactivity, as I move. Thirdly, I am suffering, or exist in a state of being\r\nacted upon, as I am moved. The when, and the where, as applicable to this\r\nexistence, depends on the successive motions of our own or of other bodies;\r\nand on their respective situations, as spoken of Sect. XIV. 2. 5.\r\n\r\n5. Our identity is known by our acquired habits or catenated trains of\r\nideas and muscular motions; and perhaps, when we compare infancy with old\r\nage, in those alone can our identity be supposed to exist. For what else is\r\nthere of similitude between the first speck of living entity and the mature\r\nman?--every deduction of reasoning, every sentiment or passion, with every\r\nfibre of the corporeal part of our system, has been subject almost to\r\nannual mutation; while some catenations alone of our ideas and muscular\r\nactions have continued in part unchanged.\r\n\r\nBy the facility, with which we can in our waking hours voluntarily produce\r\ncertain successive trains of ideas, we know by experience, that we have\r\nbefore reproduced them; that is, we are conscious of a time of our\r\nexistence previous to the present time; that is, of our identity now and\r\nheretofore. It is these habits of action, these catenations of ideas and\r\nmuscular motions, which begin with life, and only terminate with it; and\r\nwhich we can in some measure deliver to our posterity; as explained in\r\nSect. XXXIX.\r\n\r\n6. When the progressive motions of external bodies make a part of our\r\npresent catenation of ideas, we attend to the lapse of time; which appears\r\nthe longer, the more frequently we thus attend to it; as when we expect\r\nsomething at a certain hour, which much interests us, whether it be an\r\nagreeable or disagreeable event; or when we count the passing seconds on a\r\nstop-watch.\r\n\r\nWhen an idea of our own person, or a reflex idea of our pleasures and\r\npains, desires and aversions, makes a part of this catenation, it is termed\r\nconsciousness; and if this idea of consciousness makes a part of a\r\ncatenation, which we excite by recollection, and know by the facility with\r\nwhich we excite it, that we have before experienced it, it is called\r\nidentity, as explained above.\r\n\r\n7. In respect to freewill, it is certain, that we cannot will to think of a\r\nnew train of ideas, without previously thinking of the first link of it; as\r\nI cannot will to think of a black swan, without previously thinking of a\r\nblack swan. But if I now think of a tail, I can voluntarily recollect all\r\nanimals, which have tails; my will is so far free, that I can pursue the\r\nideas linked to this idea of tail, as far as my knowledge of the subject\r\nextends; but to will without motive is to will without desire or aversion;\r\nwhich is as absurd as to feel without pleasure or pain; they are both\r\nsolecisms in the terms. So far are we governed by the catenations of\r\nmotions, which affect both the body and the mind of man, and which begin\r\nwith our irritability, and end with it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

All those internal motions of animal bodies, which contribute to digest\r\ntheir aliment, produce their secretions, repair their injuries, or increase\r\ntheir growth, are performed without our attention or consciousness. They\r\nexist as well in our sleep, as in our waking hours, as well in the foetus\r\nduring the time of gestation, as in the infant after nativity, and proceed\r\nwith equal regularity in the vegetable as in the animal system. These\r\nmotions have been shewn in a former part of this work to depend on the\r\nirritations of peculiar fluids, and as they have never been classed amongst\r\nthe instinctive actions of animals, are precluded from our present\r\ndisquisition.\r\n\r\nBut all those actions of men or animals, that are attended with\r\nconsciousness, and seem neither to have been directed by their appetites,\r\ntaught by their experience, nor deduced from observation or tradition, have\r\nbeen referred to the power of instinct. And this power has been explained\r\nto be a _divine something_, a kind of inspiration; whilst the poor animal,\r\nthat possesses it, has been thought little better than _a machine_!\r\n\r\nThe _irksomeness_, that attends a continued attitude of the body, or the\r\n_pains_, that we receive from heat, cold, hunger, or other injurious\r\ncircumstances, excite us to _general locomotion_: and our senses are so\r\nformed and constituted by the hand of nature, that certain objects present\r\nus with pleasure, others with pain, and we are induced to approach and\r\nembrace these, to avoid and abhor those, as such sensations direct us.\r\n\r\nThus the palates of some animals are gratefully affected by the mastication\r\nof fruits, others of grains, and others of flesh; and they are thence\r\ninstigated to attain, and to consume those materials; and are furnished\r\nwith powers of muscular motion, and of digestion proper for such purposes.\r\n\r\nThese _sensations_ and _desires_ constitute a part of our system, as our\r\n_muscles_ and _bones_ constitute another part: and hence they may alike be\r\ntermed _natural_ or _connate_; but neither of them can properly be termed\r\n_instinctive_: as the word instinct in its usual acceptation refers only to\r\nthe _actions_ of animals, as above explained: the origin of these _actions_\r\nis the subject of our present enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe reader is intreated carefully to attend to this definition of\r\n_instinctive actions_, lest by using the word instinct without adjoining\r\nany accurate idea to it, he may not only include the natural desires of\r\nlove and hunger, and the natural sensations of pain or pleasure, but the\r\nfigure and contexture of the body, and the faculty of reason itself under\r\nthis general term.\r\n\r\nII. We experience some sensations, and perform some actions before our\r\nnativity; the sensations of cold and warmth, agitation and rest, fulness\r\nand inanition, are instances of the former; and the repeated struggles of\r\nthe limbs of the foetus, which begin about the middle of gestation, and\r\nthose motions by which it frequently wraps the umbilical chord around its\r\nneck or body, and even sometimes ties it on a knot; are instances of the\r\nlatter. Smellie's Midwifery, (Vol. I. p. 182.)\r\n\r\nBy a due attention to these circumstances many of the actions of young\r\nanimals, which at first sight seemed only referable to an inexplicable\r\ninstinct, will appear to have been acquired like all other animal actions,\r\nthat are attended with consciousness, _by the repeated efforts of our\r\nmuscles under the conduct of our sensations or desires_.\r\n\r\nThe chick in the shell begins to move its feet and legs on the sixth day of\r\nincubation (Mattreican, p. 138); or on the seventh day, (Langley);\r\nafterwards they are seen to move themselves gently in the liquid that\r\nsurrounds them, and to open and shut their mouths, (Harvei, de Generat. p.\r\n62, and 197. Form de Poulet. ii. p. 129). Puppies before the membranes are\r\nbroken, that involve them, are seen to move themselves, to put out their\r\ntongues, and to open and shut their mouths, (Harvey, Gipson, Riolan,\r\nHaller). And calves lick themselves and swallow many of their hairs before\r\ntheir nativity: which however puppies do not, (Swammerden, p. 319. Flemyng\r\nPhil. Trans. Ann. 1755. 42). And towards the end of gestation, the foetus\r\nof all animals are proved to drink part of the liquid in which they swim,\r\n(Haller. Physiol. T. 8. 204). The white of egg is found in the mouth and\r\ngizzard of the chick, and is nearly or quite consumed before it is hatched,\r\n(Harvie de Generat. 58). And the liquor amnii is found in the mouth and\r\nstomach of the human foetus, and of calves; and how else should that\r\nexcrement be produced in the intestines of all animals, which is voided in\r\ngreat quantity soon after their birth; (Gipson, Med. Essays, Edinb. V. i.\r\n13. Halleri Physiolog. T. 3. p. 318. and T. 8). In the stomach of a calf\r\nthe quantity of this liquid amounted to about three pints, and the hairs\r\namongst it were of the same colour with those on its skin, (Blasii Anat.\r\nAnimal, p.m. 122). These facts are attested by many other writers of\r\ncredit, besides those above mentioned.\r\n\r\nIII. It has been deemed a surprising instance of instinct, that calves and\r\nchickens should be able to walk by a few efforts almost immediately after\r\ntheir nativity: whilst the human infant in those countries where he is not\r\nincumbered with clothes, as in India, is five or six months, and in our\r\nclimate almost a twelvemonth, before he can safely stand upon his feet.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of all animals in the womb must resemble their mode of\r\nswimming, as by this kind of motion they can best change their attitude in\r\nwater. But the swimming of the calf and chicken resembles their manner of\r\nwalking, which they have thus in part acquired before their nativity, and\r\nhence accomplish it afterwards with very few efforts, whilst the swimming\r\nof the human creature resembles that of the frog, and totally differs from\r\nhis mode of walking.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance to be attended to in this affair, that not\r\nonly the growth of those peculiar parts of animals, which are first wanted\r\nto secure their subsistence, are in general furthest advanced before their\r\nnativity: but some animals come into the world more completely formed\r\nthroughout their whole system than others: and are thence much forwarder in\r\nall their habits of motion. Thus the colt, and the lamb, are much more\r\nperfect animals than the blind puppy, and the naked rabbit; and the chick\r\nof the pheasant, and the partridge, has more perfect plumage, and more\r\nperfect eyes, as well as greater aptitude to locomotion, than the callow\r\nnestlings of the dove, and of the wren. The parents of the former only find\r\nit necessary to shew them their food, and to teach them to take it up;\r\nwhilst those of the latter are obliged for many days to obtrude it into\r\ntheir gaping mouths.\r\n\r\nIV. From the facts mentioned in No. 2. of this Section, it is evinced that\r\nthe foetus learns to swallow before its nativity; for it is seen to open\r\nits mouth, and its stomach is found filled with the liquid that surrounds\r\nit. It opens its mouth, either instigated by hunger, or by the irksomeness\r\nof a continued attitude of the muscles of its face; the liquor amnii, in\r\nwhich it swims, is agreeable to its palate, as it consists of a nourishing\r\nmaterial, (Haller Phys. T. 8. p. 204). It is tempted to experience its\r\ntaste further in the mouth, and by a few efforts learns to swallow, in the\r\nsame manner as we learn all other animal actions, which are attended with\r\nconsciousness, _by the repeated efforts of our muscles under the conduct of\r\nour sensations or volitions_.\r\n\r\nThe inspiration of air into the lungs is so totally different from that of\r\nswallowing a fluid in which we are immersed, that it cannot be acquired\r\nbefore our nativity. But at this time, when the circulation of the blood is\r\nno longer continued through the placenta, that suffocating sensation, which\r\nwe feel about the precordia, when we are in want of fresh air, disagreeably\r\naffects the infant: and all the muscles of the body are excited into action\r\nto relieve this oppression; those of the breast, ribs, and diaphragm are\r\nfound to answer this purpose, and thus respiration is discovered, and is\r\ncontinued throughout our lives, as often as the oppression begins to recur.\r\nMany infants, both of the human creature, and of quadrupeds, struggle for a\r\nminute after they are born before they begin to breathe, (Haller Phys. T.\r\n8. p. 400. ib pt. 2. p. 1). Mr. Buffon thinks the action of the dry air\r\nupon the nerves of smell of new-born animals, by producing an endeavour to\r\nsneeze, may contribute to induce this first inspiration, and that the\r\nrarefaction of the air by the warmth of the lungs contributes to induce\r\nexpiration, (Hist. Nat. Tom. 4. p. 174). Which latter it may effect by\r\nproducing a disagreeable sensation by its delay, and a consequent effort to\r\nrelieve it. Many children sneeze before they respire, but not all, as far\r\nas I have observed, or can learn from others.\r\n\r\nAt length, by the direction of its sense of smell, or by the officious care\r\nof its mother, the young animal approaches the odoriferous rill of its\r\nfuture nourishment, already experienced to swallow. But in the act of\r\nswallowing, it is necessary nearly to close the mouth, whether the creature\r\nbe immersed in the fluid it is about to drink, or not: hence, when the\r\nchild first attempts to suck, it does not slightly compress the nipple\r\nbetween its lips, and suck as an adult person would do, by absorbing the\r\nmilk; but it takes the whole nipple into its mouth for this purpose,\r\ncompresses it between its gums, and thus repeatedly chewing (as it were)\r\nthe nipple, presses out the milk, exactly in the same manner as it is drawn\r\nfrom the teats of cows by the hands of the milkmaid. The celebrated Harvey\r\nobserves, that the foetus in the womb must have sucked in a part of its\r\nnourishment, because it knows how to suck the minute it is born, as any one\r\nmay experience by putting a finger between its lips, and because in a few\r\ndays it forgets this art of sucking, and cannot without some difficulty\r\nagain acquire it, (Exercit. de Gener. Anim. 48). The same observation is\r\nmade by Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nA little further experience teaches the young animal to suck by absorption,\r\nas well as by compression; that is, to open the chest as in the beginning\r\nof respiration, and thus to rarefy the air in the mouth, that the pressure\r\nof the denser external atmosphere may contribute to force out the milk.\r\n\r\nThe chick yet in the shell has learnt to drink by swallowing a part of the\r\nwhite of the egg for its food; but not having experienced how to take up\r\nand swallow solid seeds, or grains, is either taught by the felicitous\r\nindustry of its mother; or by many repeated attempts is enabled at length\r\nto distinguish and to swallow this kind of nutriment.\r\n\r\nAnd puppies, though they know how to suck like other animals from their\r\nprevious experience in swallowing, and in respiration; yet are they long in\r\nacquiring the art of lapping with their tongues, which from the flaccidity\r\nof their cheeks, and length of their mouths, is afterwards a more\r\nconvenient way for them to take in water.\r\n\r\nV. The senses of smell and taste in many other animals greatly excel those\r\nof mankind, for in civilized society, as our victuals are generally\r\nprepared by others, and are adulterated with salt, spice, oil, and\r\nempyreuma, we do not hesitate about eating whatever is set before us, and\r\nneglect to cultivate these senses: whereas other animals try every morsel\r\nby the smell, before they take it into their mouths, and by the taste\r\nbefore they swallow it: and are led not only each to his proper nourishment\r\nby this organ of sense, but it also at a maturer age directs them in the\r\ngratification of their appetite of love. Which may be further understood by\r\nconsidering the sympathies of these parts described in Class IV. 2. 1. 7.\r\nWhile the human animal is directed to the object of his love by his sense\r\nof beauty, as mentioned in No. VI. of this Section. Thus Virgil. Georg.\r\nIII. 250.\r\n\r\n  Nonne vides, ut tota tremor pertentat equorum\r\n  Corpora, si tantum notas odor attulit auras?\r\n  Nonne canis nidum veneris nasutus odore\r\n  Quærit, et erranti trahitur sublambere linguâ?\r\n  Respuit at gustum cupidus, labiisque retractis\r\n  Elevat os, trepidansque novis impellitur æstris\r\n  Inserit et vivum felici vomere semen.--\r\n  Quam tenui filo cæcos adnectit amores\r\n  Docta Venus, vitæque monet renovare favillam!--ANON.\r\n\r\nThe following curious experiment is related by Galen. \"On dissecting a goat\r\ngreat with young I found a brisk embryon, and having detached it from the\r\nmatrix, and snatching it away before it saw its dam, I brought it into a\r\ncertain room, where there were many vessels, some filled with wine, others\r\nwith oil, some with honey, others with milk, or some other liquor; and in\r\nothers were grains and fruits; we first observed the young animal get upon\r\nits feet, and walk; then it shook itself, and afterwards scratched its side\r\nwith one of its feet: then we saw it smelling to every one of these things,\r\nthat were set in the room; and when it had smelt to them all, it drank up\r\nthe milk.\" L. 6. de locis. cap. 6.\r\n\r\nParturient quadrupeds, as cats, and bitches, and sows, are led by their\r\nsense of smell to eat the placenta as other common food; why then do they\r\nnot devour their whole progeny, as is represented in an antient emblem of\r\nTIME? This is said sometimes to happen in the unnatural state in which we\r\nconfine sows; and indeed nature would seem to have endangered her offspring\r\nin this nice circumstance! But at this time the stimulus of the milk in the\r\ntumid teats of the mother excites her to look out for, and to desire some\r\nunknown circumstance to relieve her. At the same time the smell of the milk\r\nattracts the exertions of the young animals towards its source, and thus\r\nthe delighted mother discovers a new appetite, as mentioned in Sect. XIV.\r\n8. and her little progeny are led to receive and to communicate pleasure by\r\nthis most beautiful contrivance.\r\n\r\nVI. But though the human species in some of their sensations are much\r\ninferior to other animals, yet the accuracy of the sense of touch, which\r\nthey possess in so eminent a degree, gives them a great superiority of\r\nunderstanding; as is well observed by the ingenious Mr. Buffon. The\r\nextremities of other animals terminate in horns, and hoofs, and claws, very\r\nunfit for the sensation of touch; whilst the human hand is finely adapted\r\nto encompass its object with this organ of sense.\r\n\r\nThe elephant is indeed endued with a fine sense of feeling at the extremity\r\nof his proboscis, and hence has acquired much more accurate ideas of touch\r\nand of sight than most other creatures. The two following instances of the\r\nsagacity of these animals may entertain the reader, as they were told me by\r\nsome gentlemen of distinct observation, and undoubted veracity, who had\r\nbeen much conversant with our eastern settlements. First, the elephants\r\nthat are used to carry the baggage of our armies, are put each under the\r\ncare of one of the natives of Indostan, and whilst himself and his wife go\r\ninto the woods to collect leaves and branches of trees for his food, they\r\nfix him to the ground by a length of chain, and frequently leave a child\r\nyet unable to walk, under his protection: and the intelligent animal not\r\nonly defends it, but as it creeps about, when it arrives near the extremity\r\nof his chain, he wraps his trunk gently round its body, and brings it again\r\ninto the centre of his circle. Secondly, the traitor elephants are taught\r\nto walk on a narrow path between two pit-falls, which are covered with\r\nturf, and then to go into the woods, and to seduce the wild elephants to\r\ncome that way, who fall into these wells, whilst he passes safe between\r\nthem: and it is universally observed, that those wild elephants that escape\r\nthe snare, pursue the traitor with the utmost vehemence, and if they can\r\novertake him, which sometimes happens, they always beat him to death.\r\n\r\nThe monkey has a hand well enough adapted for the sense of touch, which\r\ncontributes to his great facility of imitation; but in taking objects with\r\nhis hands, as a stick or an apple, he puts his thumb on the same side of\r\nthem with his fingers, instead of counteracting the pressure of his fingers\r\nwith it: from this neglect he is much slower in acquiring the figures of\r\nobjects, as he is less able to determine the distances or diameters of\r\ntheir parts, or to distinguish their vis inertiæ from their hardness.\r\nHelvetius adds, that the shortness of his life, his being fugitive before\r\nmankind, and his not inhabiting all climates, combine to prevent his\r\nimprovement. (De l'Esprit. T. 1. p.) There is however at this time an old\r\nmonkey shewn in Exeter Change, London, who having lost his teeth, when nuts\r\nare given him, takes a stone into his hand, and cracks them with it one by\r\none; thus using tools to effect his purpose like mankind.\r\n\r\nThe beaver is another animal that makes much use of his hands, and if we\r\nmay credit the reports of travellers, is possessed of amazing ingenuity.\r\nThis however, M. Buffon affirms, is only where they exist in large numbers,\r\nand in countries thinly peopled with men; while in France in their solitary\r\nstate they shew no uncommon ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIndeed all the quadrupeds, that have collar-bones, (claviculæ) use their\r\nfore-limbs in some measure as we use our hands, as the cat, squirrel,\r\ntyger, bear and lion; and as they exercise the sense of touch more\r\nuniversally than other animals, so are they more sagacious in watching and\r\nsurprising their prey. All those birds, that use their claws for hands, as\r\nthe hawk, parrot, and cuckoo, appear to be more docile and intelligent;\r\nthough the gregarious tribes of birds have more acquired knowledge.\r\n\r\nNow as the images, that are painted on the retina of the eye, are no other\r\nthan signs, which recall to our imaginations the objects we had before\r\nexamined by the organ of touch, as is fully demonstrated by Dr. Berkley in\r\nhis treatise on vision; it follows that the human creature has greatly more\r\naccurate and distinct sense of vision than that of any other animal. Whence\r\nas he advances to maturity he gradually acquires a sense of female beauty,\r\nwhich at this time directs him to the object of his new passion.\r\n\r\nSentimental love, as distinguished from the animal passion of that name,\r\nwith which it is frequently accompanied, consists in the desire or\r\nsensation of beholding, embracing, and saluting a beautiful object.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of beauty therefore is that it is the object of love;\r\nand though many other objects are in common language called beautiful, yet\r\nthey are only called so metaphorically, and ought to be termed agreeable. A\r\nGrecian temple may give us the pleasurable idea of sublimity, a Gothic\r\ntemple may give us the pleasurable idea of variety, and a modern house the\r\npleasurable idea of utility; music and poetry may inspire our love by\r\nassociation of ideas; but none of these, except metaphorically, can be\r\ntermed beautiful; as we have no wish to embrace or salute them.\r\n\r\nOur perception of beauty consists in our recognition by the sense of vision\r\nof those objects, first, which have before inspired our love by the\r\npleasure, which they have afforded to many of our senses: as to our sense\r\nof warmth, of touch, of smell, of taste, hunger and thirst; and, secondly,\r\nwhich bear any analogy of form to such objects.\r\n\r\nWhen the babe, soon after it is born into this cold world, is applied to\r\nits mother's bosom; its sense of perceiving warmth is first agreeably\r\naffected; next its sense of smell is delighted with the odour of her milk;\r\nthen its taste is gratified by the flavour of it: afterwards the appetites\r\nof hunger and of thirst afford pleasure by the possession of their objects,\r\nand by the subsequent digestion of the aliment; and, lastly, the sense of\r\ntouch is delighted by the softness and smoothness of the milky fountain,\r\nthe source of such variety of happiness.\r\n\r\nAll these various kinds of pleasure at length become associated with the\r\nform of the mother's breast; which the infant embraces with its hands,\r\npresses with its lips, and watches with its eyes; and thus acquires more\r\naccurate ideas of the form of its mother's bosom, than of the odour and\r\nflavour or warmth, which it perceives by its other senses. And hence at our\r\nmaturer years, when any object of vision is presented to us, which by its\r\nwaving or spiral lines bears any similitude to the form of the female\r\nbosom, whether it be found in a landscape with soft gradations of rising\r\nand descending surface, or in the forms of some antique vases, or in other\r\nworks of the pencil or the chissel, we feel a general glow of delight,\r\nwhich seems to influence all our senses; and, if the object be not too\r\nlarge, we experience an attraction to embrace it with our arms, and to\r\nsalute it with our lips, as we did in our early infancy the bosom of our\r\nmother. And thus we find, according to the ingenious idea of Hogarth, that\r\nthe waving lines of beauty were originally taken from the temple of Venus.\r\n\r\nThis animal attraction is love; which is a sensation, when the object is\r\npresent; and a desire, when it is absent. Which constitutes the purest\r\nsource of human felicity, the cordial drop in the otherwise vapid cup of\r\nlife, and which overpays mankind for the care and labour, which are\r\nattached to the pre-eminence of his situation above other animals.\r\n\r\nIt should have been observed, that colour as well as form sometimes enters\r\ninto our idea of a beautiful object, as a good complexion for instance,\r\nbecause a fine or fair colour is in general a sign of health, and conveys\r\nto us an idea of the warmth of the object; and a pale countenance on the\r\ncontrary gives an idea of its being cold to the touch.\r\n\r\nIt was before remarked, that young animals use their lips to distinguish\r\nthe forms of things, as well as their fingers, and hence we learn the\r\norigin of our inclination to salute beautiful objects with our lips. For a\r\ndefinition of Grace, see Class III. 1. 2. 4.\r\n\r\nVII. There are two ways by which we become acquainted with the passions of\r\nothers: first, by having observed the effects of them, as of fear or anger,\r\non our own bodies, we know at sight when others are under the influence of\r\nthese affections. So when two cocks are preparing to fight, each feels the\r\nfeathers rise round his own neck, and knows from the same sign the\r\ndisposition of his adversary: and children long before they can speak, or\r\nunderstand the language of their parents, may be frightened by an angry\r\ncountenance, or soothed by smiles and blandishments.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when we put ourselves into the attitude that any passion\r\nnaturally occasions, we soon in some degree acquire that passion; hence\r\nwhen those that scold indulge themselves in loud oaths, and violent actions\r\nof the arms, they increase their anger by the mode of expressing\r\nthemselves: and on the contrary the counterfeited smile of pleasure in\r\ndisagreeable company soon brings along with it a portion of the reality, as\r\nis well illustrated by Mr. Burke. (Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful.)\r\n\r\nThis latter method of entering into the passions of others is rendered of\r\nvery extensive use by the pleasure we take in imitation, which is every day\r\npresented before our eyes, in the actions of children, and indeed in all\r\nthe customs and fashions of the world. From this our aptitude to imitation,\r\narises what is generally understood by the word sympathy so well explained\r\nby Dr. Smith of Glasgow. Thus the appearance of a cheerful countenance\r\ngives us pleasure, and of a melancholy one makes us sorrowful. Yawning and\r\nsometimes vomiting are thus propagated by sympathy, and some people of\r\ndelicate fibres, at the presence of a spectacle of misery, have felt pain\r\nin the same parts of their own bodies, that were diseased or mangled in the\r\nother. Amongst the writers of antiquity Aristotle thought this aptitude to\r\nimitation an essential property of the human species, and calls man an\r\nimitative animal. [Greek: To zôon mimômenon].\r\n\r\nThese then are the natural signs by which we understand each other, and on\r\nthis slender basis is built all human language. For without some natural\r\nsigns, no artificial ones could have been invented or understood, as is\r\nvery ingeniously observed by Dr. Reid. (Inquiry into the Human Mind.)\r\n\r\nVIII. The origin of this universal language is a subject of the highest\r\ncuriosity, the knowledge of which has always been thought utterly\r\ninaccessible. A part of which we shall however here attempt.\r\n\r\nLight, sound, and odours, are unknown to the foetus in the womb, which,\r\nexcept the few sensations and motions already mentioned, sleeps away its\r\ntime insensible of the busy world. But the moment he arrives into day, he\r\nbegins to experience many vivid pains and pleasures; these are at the same\r\ntime attended with certain muscular motions, and from this their early, and\r\nindividual association, they acquire habits of occurring together, that are\r\nafterwards indissoluble.\r\n\r\n1. _Of Fear._\r\n\r\nAs soon as the young animal is born, the first important sensations, that\r\noccur to him, are occasioned by the oppression about his precordia for want\r\nof respiration, and by his sudden transition from ninety-eight degrees of\r\nheat into so cold a climate.--He trembles, that is, he exerts alternately\r\nall the muscles of his body, to enfranchise himself from the oppression\r\nabout his bosom, and begins to breathe with frequent and short\r\nrespirations; at the same time the cold contracts his red skin, gradually\r\nturning it pale; the contents of the bladder and of the bowels are\r\nevacuated: and from the experience of these first disagreeable sensations\r\nthe passion of fear is excited, which is no other than the expectation of\r\ndisagreeable sensations. This early association of motions and sensations\r\npersists throughout life; the passion of fear produces a cold and pale\r\nskin, with tremblings, quick respiration, and an evacuation of the bladder\r\nand bowels, and thus constitutes the natural or universal language of this\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nOn observing a Canary bird this morning, January 28, 1772, at the house of\r\nMr. Harvey, near Tutbury, in Derbyshire, I was told it always fainted away,\r\nwhen its cage was cleaned, and desired to see the experiment. The cage\r\nbeing taken from the ceiling, and its bottom drawn out, the bird began to\r\ntremble, and turned quite white about the root of his bill: he then opened\r\nhis mouth as if for breath, and respired quick, stood straighter up on his\r\nperch, hung his wings, spread his tail, closed his eyes, and appeared quite\r\nstiff and cataleptic for near half an hour, and at length with much\r\ntrembling and deep respirations came gradually to himself.\r\n\r\n2. _Of Grief._\r\n\r\nThat the internal membrane of the nostrils may be kept always moist, for\r\nthe better perception of odours, there are two canals, that conduct the\r\ntears after they have done their office in moistening and cleaning the ball\r\nof the eye into a sack, which is called the lacrymal sack; and from which\r\nthere is a duct, that opens into the nostrils: the aperture of this duct is\r\nformed of exquisite sensibility, and when it is stimulated by odorous\r\nparticles, or by the dryness or coldness of the air, the sack contracts\r\nitself, and pours more of its contained moisture on the organ of smell. By\r\nthis contrivance the organ is rendered more fit for perceiving such odours,\r\nand is preserved from being injured by those that are more strong or\r\ncorrosive. Many other receptacles of peculiar fluids disgorge their\r\ncontents, when the ends of their ducts are stimulated; as the gall bladder,\r\nwhen the contents of the duodenum stimulate the extremity of the common\r\nbile duct: and the salivary glands, when the termination of their ducts in\r\nthe mouth are excited by the stimulus of the food we masticate. Atque\r\nvesiculæ seminales suum exprimunt fluidum glande penis fricatâ.\r\n\r\nThe coldness and dryness of the atmosphere, compared with the warmth and\r\nmoisture, which the new-born infant had just before experienced,\r\ndisagreeably affects the aperture of this lacrymal sack: the tears, that\r\nare contained in this sack, are poured into the nostrils, and a further\r\nsupply is secreted by the lacrymal glands, and diffused upon the eye-balls;\r\nas is very visible in the eyes and nostrils of children soon after their\r\nnativity. The same happens to us at our maturer age, for in severe frosty\r\nweather, snivelling and tears are produced by the coldness and dryness of\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nBut the lacrymal glands, which separate the tears from the blood, are\r\nsituated on the upper external part of the globes of each eye; and, when a\r\ngreater quantity of tears are wanted, we contract the forehead, and bring\r\ndown the eye-brows, and use many other distortions of the face, to compress\r\nthese glands.\r\n\r\nNow as the suffocating sensation, that produces respiration, is removed\r\nalmost as soon as perceived, and does not recur again: this disagreeable\r\nirritation of the lacrymal ducts, as it must frequently recur, till the\r\ntender organ becomes used to variety of odours, is one of the first pains\r\nthat is repeatedly attended to: and hence throughout our infancy, and in\r\nmany people throughout their lives, all disagreeable sensations are\r\nattended with snivelling at the nose, a profusion of tears, and some\r\npeculiar distortions of countenance: according to the laws of early\r\nassociation before mentioned, which constitutes the natural or universal\r\nlanguage of grief.\r\n\r\nYou may assure yourself of the truth of this observation, if you will\r\nattend to what passes, when you read a distressful tale alone; before the\r\ntears overflow your eyes, you will invariably feel a titillation at that\r\nextremity of the lacrymal duct, which terminates in the nostril, then the\r\ncompression of the eyes succeeds, and the profusion of tears.\r\n\r\nLinnæus asserts, that the female bear sheds tears in grief; the same has\r\nbeen said of the hind, and some other animals.\r\n\r\n3. _Of Tender Pleasure._\r\n\r\nThe first most lively impression of pleasure, that the infant enjoys after\r\nits nativity, is excited by the odour of its mother's milk. The organ of\r\nsmell is irritated by this perfume, and the lacrymal sack empties itself\r\ninto the nostrils, as before explained, and an increase of tears is poured\r\ninto the eyes. Any one may observe this, when very young infants are about\r\nto suck; for at those early periods of life, the sensation affects the\r\norgan of smell, much more powerfully, than after the repeated habits of\r\nsmelling has inured it to odours of common strength: and in our adult\r\nyears, the stronger smells, though they are at the same time agreeable to\r\nus, as of volatile spirits, continue to produce an increased secretion of\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThis pleasing sensation of smell is followed by the early affection of the\r\ninfant to the mother that suckles it, and hence the tender feelings of\r\ngratitude and love, as well as of hopeless grief, are ever after joined\r\nwith the titillation of the extremity of the lacrymal ducts, and a\r\nprofusion of tears.\r\n\r\nNor is it singular, that the lacrymal sack should be influenced by pleasing\r\nideas, as the sight of agreeable food produces the same effect on the\r\nsalivary glands. Ac dum vidimus insomniis lascivæ puellæ simulacrum\r\ntenditur penis.\r\n\r\nLambs shake or wriggle their tails, at the time when they first suck, to\r\nget free of the hard excrement, which had been long lodged in their bowels.\r\nHence this becomes afterwards a mark of pleasure in them, and in dogs, and\r\nother tailed animals. But cats gently extend and contract their paws when\r\nthey are pleased, and purr by drawing in their breath, both which resemble\r\ntheir manner of sucking, and thus become their language of pleasure, for\r\nthese animals having collar-bones use their paws like hands when they suck,\r\nwhich dogs and sheep do not.\r\n\r\n4. _Of Serene Pleasure._\r\n\r\nIn the action of sucking, the lips of the infant are closed around the\r\nnipple of its mother, till he has filled his stomach, and the pleasure\r\noccasioned by the stimulus of this grateful food succeeds. Then the\r\nsphincter of the mouth, fatigued by the continued action of sucking, is\r\nrelaxed; and the antagonist muscles of the face gently acting, produce the\r\nsmile of pleasure: as cannot but be seen by all who are conversant with\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nHence this smile during our lives is associated with gentle pleasure; it is\r\nvisible in kittens, and puppies, when they are played with, and tickled;\r\nbut more particularly marks the human features. For in children this\r\nexpression of pleasure is much encouraged, by their imitation of their\r\nparents, or friends; who generally address them with a smiling countenance:\r\nand hence some nations are more remarkable for the gaiety, and others for\r\nthe gravity of their looks.\r\n\r\n5. _Of Anger._\r\n\r\nThe actions that constitute the mode of fighting, are the immediate\r\nlanguage of anger in all animals; and a preparation for these actions is\r\nthe natural language of threatening. Hence the human creature clenches his\r\nfist, and sternly surveys his adversary, as if meditating where to make the\r\nattack; the ram, and the bull, draws himself some steps backwards, and\r\nlevels his horns; and the horse, as he most frequently fights by striking\r\nwith his hinder feet, turns his heels to his foe, and bends back his ears,\r\nto listen out the place of his adversary, that the threatened blow may not\r\nbe ineffectual.\r\n\r\n6. _Of Attention._\r\n\r\nThe eye takes in at once but half our horizon, and that only in the day,\r\nand our smell informs us of no very distant objects, hence we confide\r\nprincipally in the organ of hearing to apprize us of danger: when we hear\r\nany the smallest sound, that we cannot immediately account for, our fears\r\nare alarmed, we suspend our steps, hold every muscle still, open our mouths\r\na little, erect our ears, and listen to gain further information: and this\r\nby habit becomes the general language of attention to objects of sight, as\r\nwell as of hearing; and even to the successive trains of our ideas.\r\n\r\nThe natural language of violent pain, which is expressed by writhing the\r\nbody, grinning, and screaming; and that of tumultuous pleasure, expressed\r\nin loud laughter; belong to Section XXXIV. on Diseases from Volition.\r\n\r\nIX. It must have already appeared to the reader, that all other animals, as\r\nwell as man, are possessed of this natural language of the passions,\r\nexpressed in signs or tones; and we shall endeavour to evince, that those\r\nanimals, which have preserved themselves from being enslaved by mankind,\r\nand are associated in flocks, are also possessed of some artificial\r\nlanguage, and of some traditional knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe mother-turkey, when she eyes a kite hovering high in air, has either\r\nseen her own parents thrown into fear at his presence, or has by\r\nobservation been acquainted with his dangerous designs upon her young. She\r\nbecomes agitated with fear, and uses the natural language of that passion,\r\nher young ones catch the fear by imitation, and in an instant conceal\r\nthemselves in the grass.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that she shews her fears by her gesture and deportment,\r\nshe uses a certain exclamation, Koe-ut, Koe-ut, and the young ones\r\nafterwards know, when they hear this note, though they do not see their\r\ndam, that the presence of their adversary is denounced, and hide themselves\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nThe wild tribes of birds have very frequent opportunities of knowing their\r\nenemies, by observing the destruction they make among their progeny, of\r\nwhich every year but a small part escapes to maturity: but to our domestic\r\nbirds these opportunities so rarely occur, that their knowledge of their\r\ndistant enemies must frequently be delivered by tradition in the manner\r\nabove explained, through many generations.\r\n\r\nThis note of danger, as well as the other notes of the mother-turkey, when\r\nshe calls her flock to their food, or to sleep under her wings, appears to\r\nbe an artificial language, both as expressed by the mother, and as\r\nunderstood by the progeny. For a hen teaches this language with equal ease\r\nto the ducklings, she has hatched from suppositious eggs, and educates as\r\nher own offspring: and the wagtails, or hedge-sparrows, learn it from the\r\nyoung cuckoo their softer nursling, and supply him with food long after he\r\ncan fly about, whenever they hear his cuckooing, which Linnæus tells us, is\r\nhis call of hunger, (Syst. Nat.) And all our domestic animals are readily\r\ntaught to come to us for food, when we use one tone of voice, and to fly\r\nfrom our anger, when we use another.\r\n\r\nRabbits, as they cannot easily articulate sounds, and are formed into\r\nsocieties, that live under ground, have a very different method of giving\r\nalarm. When danger is threatened, they thump on the ground with one of\r\ntheir hinder feet, and produce a sound, that can be heard a great way by\r\nanimals near the surface of the earth, which would seem to be an artificial\r\nsign both from its singularity and its aptness to the situation of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe rabbits on the island of Sor, near Senegal, have white flesh, and are\r\nwell tasted, but do not burrow in the earth, so that we may suspect their\r\ndigging themselves houses in this cold climate is an acquired art, as well\r\nas their note of alarm, (Adanson's Voyage to Senegal).\r\n\r\nThe barking of dogs is another curious note of alarm, and would seem to be\r\nan acquired language, rather than a natural sign: for \"in the island of\r\nJuan Fernandes, the dogs did not attempt to bark, till some European dogs\r\nwere put among them, and then they gradually begun to imitate them, but in\r\na strange manner at first, as if they were learning a thing that was not\r\nnatural to them,\" (Voyage to South America by Don G. Juan, and Don Ant. de\r\nUlloa. B. 2. c. 4).\r\n\r\nLinnæus also observes, that the dogs of South America do not bark at\r\nstrangers, (Syst. Nat.) And the European dogs, that have been carried to\r\nGuinea, are said in three or four generations to cease to bark, and only\r\nhowl, like the dogs that are natives of that coast, (World Displayed, Vol.\r\nXVII. p. 26.)\r\n\r\nA circumstance not dissimilar to this, and equally curious, is mentioned by\r\nKircherus, de Musurgia, in his Chapter de Lusciniis, \"That the young\r\nnightingales, that are hatched under other birds, never sing till they are\r\ninstructed by the company of other nightingales.\" And Jonston affirms, that\r\nthe nightingales that visit Scotland, have not the same harmony as those of\r\nItaly, (Pennant's Zoology, octavo, p. 255); which would lead us to suspect\r\nthat the singing of birds, like human music, is an artificial language\r\nrather than a natural expression of passion.\r\n\r\nX. Our music like our language, is perhaps entirely constituted of\r\nartificial tones, which by habit suggest certain agreeable passions. For\r\nthe same combination of notes and tones do not excite devotion, love, or\r\npoetic melancholy in a native of Indostan and of Europe. And \"the\r\nHighlander has the same warlike ideas annexed to the sound of a bagpipe (an\r\ninstrument which an Englishman derides), as the Englishman has to that of a\r\ntrumpet or fife,\" (Dr. Brown's Union of Poetry and Music, p. 58.) So \"the\r\nmusic of the Turks is very different from the Italian, and the people of\r\nFez and Morocco have again a different kind, which to us appears very rough\r\nand horrid, but is highly pleasing to them,\" (L'Arte Armoniaca a Giorgio\r\nAntoniotto). Hence we see why the Italian opera does not delight an\r\nuntutored Englishman; and why those, who are unaccustomed to music, are\r\nmore pleased with a tune, the second or third time they hear it, than the\r\nfirst. For then the same melodious train of sounds excites the melancholy,\r\nthey had learned from the song; or the same vivid combination of them\r\nrecalls all the mirthful ideas of the dance and company.\r\n\r\nEven the sounds, that were once disagreeable to us, may by habit be\r\nassociated with other ideas, so as to become agreeable. Father Lasitau, in\r\nhis account of the Iroquois, says \"the music and dance of those Americans,\r\nhave something in them extremely barbarous, which at first disgusts. We\r\ngrow reconciled to them by degrees, and in the end partake of them with\r\npleasure, the savages themselves are fond of them to distraction,\" (Moeurs\r\ndes Savages, Tom. ii.)\r\n\r\nThere are indeed a few sounds, that we very generally associate with\r\nagreeable ideas, as the whistling of birds, or purring of animals, that are\r\ndelighted; and some others, that we as generally associate with\r\ndisagreeable ideas, as the cries of animals in pain, the hiss of some of\r\nthem in anger, and the midnight howl of beasts of prey. Yet we receive no\r\nterrible or sublime ideas from the lowing of a cow, or the braying of an\r\nass. Which evinces, that these emotions are owing to previous associations.\r\nSo if the rumbling of a carriage in the street be for a moment mistaken for\r\nthunder, we receive a sublime sensation, which ceases as soon as we know it\r\nis the noise of a coach and six.\r\n\r\nThere are other disagreeable sounds, that are said to set the teeth on\r\nedge; which, as they have always been thought a necessary effect of certain\r\ndiscordant notes, become a proper subject of our enquiry. Every one in his\r\nchildhood has repeatedly bit a part of the glass or earthen vessel, in\r\nwhich his food has been given him, and has thence had a very disagreeable\r\nsensation in the teeth, which sensation was designed by nature to prevent\r\nus from exerting them on objects harder than themselves. The jarring sound\r\nproduced between the cup and the teeth is always attendant on this\r\ndisagreeable sensation: and ever after when such a sound is accidentally\r\nproduced by the conflict of two hard bodies, we feel by association of\r\nideas the concomitant disagreeable sensation in our teeth.\r\n\r\nOthers have in their infancy frequently held the corner of a silk\r\nhandkerchief in their mouth, or the end of the velvet cape of their coat,\r\nwhilst their companions in play have plucked it from them, and have given\r\nanother disagreeable sensation to their teeth, which has afterwards\r\nrecurred on touching those materials. And the sight of a knife drawn along\r\na china plate, though no sound is excited by it, and even the imagination\r\nof such a knife and plate so scraped together, I know by repeated\r\nexperience will produce the same disagreeable sensation of the teeth.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances indisputably prove, that this sensation of the\r\ntooth-edge is owing to associated ideas; as it is equally excitable by\r\nsight, touch, hearing, or imagination.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the artificial proportions of sound excited by musical\r\ninstruments, those, who have early in life associated them with agreeable\r\nideas, and have nicely attended to distinguish them from each other, are\r\nsaid to have a good ear, in that country where such proportions are in\r\nfashion: and not from any superior perfection in the organ of hearing, or\r\nany intuitive sympathy between certain sounds and passions.\r\n\r\nI have observed a child to be exquisitely delighted with music, and who\r\ncould with great facility learn to sing any tune that he heard distinctly,\r\nand yet whole organ of hearing was so imperfect, that it was necessary to\r\nspeak louder to him in common conversation than to others.\r\n\r\nOur music, like our architecture, seems to have no foundation in nature,\r\nthey are both arts purely of human creation, as they imitate nothing. And\r\nthe professors of them have only classed those circumstances, that are most\r\nagreeable to the accidental taste of their age, or country; and have called\r\nit Proportion. But this proportion must always fluctuate, as it rests on\r\nthe caprices, that are introduced into our minds by our various modes of\r\neducation. And these fluctuations of taste must become more frequent in the\r\npresent age, where mankind have enfranchised themselves from the blind\r\nobedience to the rules of antiquity in perhaps every science, but that of\r\narchitecture. See Sect. XII. 7. 3.\r\n\r\nXI. There are many articles of knowledge, which the animals in cultivated\r\ncountries seem to learn very early in their lives, either from each other,\r\nor from experience, or observation: one of the most general of these is to\r\navoid mankind. There is so great a resemblance in the natural language of\r\nthe passions of all animals, that we generally know, when they are in a\r\npacific, or in a malevolent humour, they have the same knowledge of us; and\r\nhence we can scold them from us by some tones and gestures, and could\r\npossibly attract them to us by others, if they were not already apprized of\r\nour general malevolence towards them. Mr. Gmelin, Professor at Petersburg,\r\nassures us, that in his journey into Siberia, undertaken by order of the\r\nEmpress of Russia, he saw foxes, that expressed no fear of himself or\r\ncompanions, but permitted him to come quite near them, having never seen\r\nthe human creature before. And Mr. Bongainville relates, that at his\r\narrival at the Malouine, or Falkland's Islands, which were not inhabited by\r\nmen, all the animals came about himself and his people; the fowls settling\r\nupon their heads and shoulders, and the quadrupeds running about their\r\nfeet. From the difficulty of acquiring the confidence of old animals, and\r\nthe ease of taming young ones, it appears that the fear, they all conceive\r\nat the sight of mankind, is an acquired article of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge is more nicely understood by rooks, who are formed into\r\nsocieties, and build, as it were, cities over our heads; they evidently\r\ndistinguish, that the danger is greater when a man is armed with a gun.\r\nEvery one has seen this, who in the spring of the year has walked under a\r\nrookery with a gun in his hand: the inhabitants of the trees rise on their\r\nwings, and scream to the unfledged young to shrink into their nests from\r\nthe sight of the enemy. The vulgar observing this circumstance so uniformly\r\nto occur, assert that rooks can smell gun-powder.\r\n\r\nThe fieldfares, (turdus pilarus) which breed in Norway, and come hither in\r\nthe cold season for our winter berries; as they are associated in flocks,\r\nand are in a foreign country, have evident marks of keeping a kind of\r\nwatch, to remark and announce the appearance of danger. On approaching a\r\ntree, that is covered with them, they continue fearless till one at the\r\nextremity of the bush rising on his wings gives a loud and peculiar note of\r\nalarm, when they all immediately fly, except one other, who continues till\r\nyou approach still nearer, to certify as it were the reality of the danger,\r\nand then he also flies off repeating the note of alarm.\r\n\r\nAnd in the woods about Senegal there is a bird called uett-uett by the\r\nnegroes, and squallers by the French, which, as soon as they see a man, set\r\nup a loud scream, and keep flying round him, as if their intent was to warn\r\nother birds, which upon hearing the cry immediately take wing. These birds\r\nare the bane of sportsmen, and frequently put me into a passion, and\r\nobliged me to shoot them, (Adanson's Voyage to Senegal, 78). For the same\r\nintent the lesser birds of our climate seem to fly after a hawk, cuckoo, or\r\nowl, and scream to prevent their companions from being surprised by the\r\ngeneral enemies of themselves, or of their eggs and progeny.\r\n\r\nBut the lapwing, (charadrius pluvialis Lin.) when her unfledged offspring\r\nrun about the marshes, where they were hatched, not only gives the note of\r\nalarm at the approach of men or dogs, that her young may conceal\r\nthemselves; but flying and screaming near the adversary, she appears more\r\nfelicitous and impatient, as he recedes from her family, and thus\r\nendeavours to mislead him, and frequently succeeds in her design. These\r\nlast instances are so apposite to the situation, rather than to the natures\r\nof the creatures, that use them; and are so similar to the actions of men\r\nin the same circumstances, that we cannot but believe, that they proceed\r\nfrom a similar principle.\r\n\r\nMiss M.E. Jacson acquainted me, that she witnessed this autumn an agreeable\r\ninstance of sagacity in a little bird, which seemed to use the means to\r\nobtain an end; the bird repeatedly hopped upon a poppy-stem, and shook the\r\nhead with its bill, till many seeds were scattered, then it settled on the\r\nground, and eat the seeds, and again repeated the same management. Sept. 1,\r\n1794.\r\n\r\nOn the northern coast of Ireland a friend of mine saw above a hundred crows\r\nat once preying upon muscles; each crow took a muscle up into the air\r\ntwenty or forty yards high, and let it fall on the stones, and thus by\r\nbreaking the shell, got possession of the animal.--A certain philosopher (I\r\nthink it was Anaxagoras) walking along the sea-shore to gather shells, one\r\nof these unlucky birds mistaking his bald head for a stone, dropped a\r\nshell-fish upon it, and killed at once a philosopher and an oyster.\r\n\r\nOur domestic animals, that have some liberty, are also possessed of some\r\npeculiar traditional knowledge: dogs and cats have been forced into each\r\nother's society, though naturally animals of a very different kind, and\r\nhave hence learned from each other to eat dog's grass (agrostis canina)\r\nwhen they are sick, to promote vomiting. I have seen a cat mistake the\r\nblade of barley for this grass, which evinces it is an acquired knowledge.\r\nThey have also learnt of each other to cover their excrement and\r\nurine;--about a spoonful of water was spilt upon my hearth from the\r\ntea-kettle, and I observed a kitten cover it with ashes. Hence this must\r\nalso be an acquired art, as the creature mistook the application of it.\r\n\r\nTo preserve their fur clean, and especially their whiskers, cats wash their\r\nfaces, and generally quite behind their ears, every time they eat. As they\r\ncannot lick those places with their tongues, they first wet the inside of\r\nthe leg with saliva, and then repeatedly wash their faces with it, which\r\nmust originally be an effect of reasoning, because a means is used to\r\nproduce an effect; and seems afterwards to be taught or acquired by\r\nimitation, like the greatest part of human arts.\r\n\r\nThese animals seem to possess something like an additional sense by means\r\nof their whiskers; which have perhaps some analogy to the antennæ of moths\r\nand butterflies. The whiskers of cats consist not only of the long hairs on\r\ntheir upper lips, but they have also four or five long hairs standing up\r\nfrom each eyebrow, and also two or three on each cheek; all which, when the\r\nanimal erects them, make with their points so many parts of the periphery\r\nof a circle, of an extent at least equal to the circumference of any part\r\nof their own bodies. With this instrument, I conceive, by a little\r\nexperience, they can at once determine, whether any aperture amongst hedges\r\nor shrubs, in which animals of this genus live in their wild state, is\r\nlarge enough to admit their bodies; which to them is a matter of the\r\ngreatest consequence, whether pursuing or pursued. They have likewise a\r\npower of erecting and bringing forward the whiskers on their lips; which\r\nprobably is for the purpose of feeling, whether a dark hole be further\r\npermeable.\r\n\r\nThe antennæ, or horns, of butterflies and moths, who have awkward wings,\r\nthe minute feathers of which are very liable to injury, serve, I suppose, a\r\nsimilar purpose of measuring, as they fly or creep amongst the leaves of\r\nplants and trees, whither their wings can pass without touching them.\r\n\r\nMr. Leonard, a very intelligent friend of mine, saw a cat catch a trout by\r\ndarting upon it in a deep clear water at the mill at Weaford, near\r\nLichfield. The cat belonged to Mr. Stanley, who had often seen her catch\r\nfish in the same manner in summer, when the mill-pool was drawn so low,\r\nthat the fish could be seen. I have heard of other cats taking fish in\r\nshallow water, as they stood on the bank. This seems a natural art of\r\ntaking their prey in cats, which their acquired delicacy by domestication\r\nhas in general prevented them from using, though their desire of eating\r\nfish continues in its original strength.\r\n\r\nMr. White, in his ingenious History of Selbourn, was witness to a cat's\r\nsuckling a young hare, which followed her about the garden, and came\r\njumping to her call of affection. At Elford, near Lichfield, the Rev. Mr.\r\nSawley had taken the young ones out of a hare, which was shot; they were\r\nalive, and the cat, who had just lost her own kittens, carried them away,\r\nas it was supposed, to eat them; but it presently appeared, that it was\r\naffection not hunger which incited her, as she suckled them, and brought\r\nthem up as their mother.\r\n\r\nOther instances of the mistaken application of what has been termed\r\ninstinct may be observed in flies in the night, who mistaking a candle for\r\nday-light, approach and perish in the flame. So the putrid smell of the\r\nstapelia, or carrion-flower, allures the large flesh-fly to deposit its\r\nyoung worms on its beautiful petals, which perish there for want of\r\nnourishment. This therefore cannot be a necessary instinct, because the\r\ncreature mistakes the application of it.\r\n\r\nThough in this country horses shew little vestiges of policy, yet in the\r\ndeserts of Tartary, and Siberia, when hunted by the Tartars they are seen\r\nto form a kind of community, set watches to prevent their being surprised,\r\nand have commanders, who direct, and hasten their flight, Origin of\r\nLanguage, Vol. I. p. 212. In this country, where four or five horses travel\r\nin a line, the first always points his ears forward, and the last points\r\nhis backward, while the intermediate ones seem quite careless in this\r\nrespect; which seems a part of policy to prevent surprise. As all animals\r\ndepend most on the ear to apprize them of the approach of danger, the eye\r\ntaking in only half the horizon at once, and horses possess a great nicety\r\nof this sense; as appears from their mode of fighting mentioned No. 8. 5.\r\nof this Section, as well as by common observation.\r\n\r\nThere are some parts of a horse, which he cannot conveniently rub, when\r\nthey itch, as about the shoulder, which he can neither bite with his teeth,\r\nnor scratch with his hind foot; when this part itches, he goes to another\r\nhorse, and gently bites him in the part which he wishes to be bitten, which\r\nis immediately done by his intelligent friend. I once observed a young foal\r\nthus bite its large mother, who did not choose to drop the grass she had in\r\nher mouth, and rubbed her nose against the foal's neck instead of biting\r\nit; which evinces that she knew the design of her progeny, and was not\r\ngoverned by a necessary instinct to bite where she was bitten.\r\n\r\nMany of our shrubs, which would otherwise afford an agreeable food to\r\nhorses, are armed with thorns or prickles, which secure them from those\r\nanimals; as the holly, hawthorn, gooseberry, gorse. In the extensive\r\nmoorlands of Staffordshire, the horses have learnt to stamp upon a\r\ngorse-bush with one of their fore-feet for a minute together, and when the\r\npoints are broken, they eat it without injury. The horses in the new forest\r\nin Hampshire are affirmed to do the same by Mr. Gilpin. Forest Scenery, II.\r\n251, and 112. Which is an art other horses in the fertile parts of the\r\ncountry do not possess, and prick their mouths till they bleed, if they are\r\ninduced by hunger or caprice to attempt eating gorse.\r\n\r\nSwine have a sense of touch as well as of smell at the end of their nose,\r\nwhich they use as a hand, both to root up the soil, and to turn over and\r\nexamine objects of food, somewhat like the proboscis of an elephant. As\r\nthey require shelter from the cold in this climate, they have learnt to\r\ncollect straw in their mouths to make their nest, when the wind blows cold;\r\nand to call their companions by repeated cries to assist in the work, and\r\nadd to their warmth by their numerous bedfellows. Hence these animals,\r\nwhich are esteemed so unclean, have also learned never to befoul their\r\ndens, where they have liberty, with their own excrement; an art, which cows\r\nand horses, which have open hovels to run into, have never acquired. I have\r\nobserved great sagacity in swine; but the short lives we allow them, and\r\ntheir general confinement, prevents their improvement, which might probably\r\nbe otherwise greater than that of dogs.\r\n\r\nInstances of the sagacity and knowledge of animals are very numerous to\r\nevery observer, and their docility in learning various arts from mankind,\r\nevinces that they may learn similar arts from their own species, and thus\r\nbe possessed of much acquired and traditional knowledge.\r\n\r\nA dog whose natural prey is sheep, is taught by mankind, not only to leave\r\nthem unmolested, but to guard them; and to hunt, to set, or to destroy\r\nother kinds of animals, as birds, or vermin; and in some countries to catch\r\nfish, in others to find truffles, and to practise a great variety of\r\ntricks; is it more surprising that the crows should teach each other, that\r\nthe hawk can catch less birds, by the superior swiftness of his wing, and\r\nif two of them follow him, till he succeeds in his design, that they can by\r\nforce share a part of the capture? This I have formerly observed with\r\nattention and astonishment.\r\n\r\nThere is one kind of pelican mentioned by Mr. Osbeck, one of Linnæus's\r\ntravelling pupils (the pelicanus aquilus), whose food is fish; and which it\r\ntakes from other birds, because it is not formed to catch them itself;\r\nhence it is called by the English a Man-of-war-bird, Voyage to China, p.\r\n88. There are many other interesting anecdotes of the pelican and\r\ncormorant, collected from authors of the best authority, in a well-managed\r\nNatural History for Children, published by Mr. Galton. Johnson. London.\r\n\r\nAnd the following narration from the very accurate Mons. Adanson, in his\r\nVoyage to Senegal, may gain credit with the reader: as his employment in\r\nthis country was solely to make observations in natural history. On the\r\nriver Niger, in his road to the island Griel, he saw a great number of\r\npelicans, or wide throats. \"They moved with great state like swans upon the\r\nwater, and are the largest bird next to the ostrich; the bill of the one I\r\nkilled was upwards of a foot and half long, and the bag fastened underneath\r\nit held two and twenty pints of water. They swim in flocks, and form a\r\nlarge circle, which they contract afterwards, driving the fish before them\r\nwith their legs: when they see the fish in sufficient number confined in\r\nthis space, they plunge their bill wide open into the water, and shut it\r\nagain with great quickness. They thus get fish into their throat-bag, which\r\nthey eat afterwards on shore at their leisure.\" P. 247.\r\n\r\nXII. The knowledge and language of those birds, that frequently change\r\ntheir climate with the seasons, is still more extensive: as they perform\r\nthese migrations in large societies, and are less subject to the power of\r\nman, than the resident tribes of birds. They are said to follow a leader\r\nduring the day, who is occasionally changed, and to keep a continual cry\r\nduring the night to keep themselves together. It is probable that these\r\nemigrations were at first undertaken as accident directed, by the more\r\nadventurous of their species, and learned from one another like the\r\ndiscoveries of mankind in navigation. The following circumstances strongly\r\nsupport this opinion.\r\n\r\n1. Nature has provided these animals, in the climates where they are\r\nproduced, with another resource: when the season becomes too cold for their\r\nconstitutions, or the food they were supported with ceases to be supplied,\r\nI mean that of sleeping. Dormice, snakes, and bats, have not the means of\r\nchanging their country; the two former from the want of wings, and the\r\nlatter from his being not able to bear the light of the day. Hence these\r\nanimals are obliged to make use of this resource, and sleep during the\r\nwinter. And those swallows that have been hatched too late in the year to\r\nacquire their full strength of pinion, or that have been maimed by accident\r\nor disease, have been frequently found in the hollows of rocks on the sea\r\ncoasts, and even under water in this torpid state, from which they have\r\nbeen revived by the warmth of a fire. This torpid state of swallows is\r\ntestified by innumerable evidences both of antient and modern names.\r\nAristotle speaking of the swallows says, \"They pass into warmer climates in\r\nwinter, if such places are at no great distance; if they are, they bury\r\nthemselves in the climates where they dwell,\" (8. Hist. c. 16. See also\r\nDerham's Phys. Theol. v. ii. p. 177.)\r\n\r\nHence their emigrations cannot depend on a _necessary_ instinct, as the\r\nemigrations themselves are not _necessary_.\r\n\r\n2. When the weather becomes cold, the swallows in the neighbourhood\r\nassemble in large flocks; that is, the unexperienced attend those that have\r\nbefore experienced the journey they are about to undertake: they are then\r\nseen some time to hover on the coast, till there is calm whether, or a\r\nwind, that suits the direction of their flight. Other birds of passage have\r\nbeen drowned by thousands in the sea, or have settled on ships quite\r\nexhausted with fatigue. And others, either by mistaking their course, or by\r\ndistress of weather, have arrived in countries where they were never seen\r\nbefore: and thus are evidently subject to the same hazards that the human\r\nspecies undergo, in the execution of their artificial purposes.\r\n\r\n3. The same birds are emigrant from some countries and not so from others:\r\nthe swallows were seen at Goree in January by an ingenious philosopher of\r\nmy acquaintance, and he was told that they continued there all the year; as\r\nthe warmth of the climate was at all seasons sufficient for their own\r\nconstitutions, and for the production of the flies that supply them with\r\nnourishment. Herodotus says, that in Libya, about the springs of the Nile,\r\nthe swallows continue all the year. (L. 2.)\r\n\r\nQuails (tetrao corturnix, Lin.) are birds of passage from the coast of\r\nBarbary to Italy, and have frequently settled in large shoals on ships\r\nfatigued with their flight. (Ray, Wisdom of God, p. 129. Derham. Physic.\r\nTheol. v. ii. p. 178,) Dr. Ruffel, in his History of Aleppo, observes that\r\nthe swallows visit that country about the end of February, and having\r\nhatched their young disappear about the end of July; and returning again\r\nabout the beginning of October, continue about a fortnight, and then again\r\ndisappear. (P. 70.)\r\n\r\nWhen my late friend Dr. Chambres, of Derby, was on the island of Caprea in\r\nthe bay of Naples, he was informed that great flights of quails annually\r\nsettle on that island about the beginning of May, in their passage from\r\nAfrica to Europe. And that they always come when the south-east wind blows,\r\nare fatigued when they rest on this island, and are taken in such amazing\r\nquantities and sold to the Continent, that the inhabitants pay the bishop\r\nhis stipend out of the profits arising from the sale of them.\r\n\r\nThe flights of these birds across the Mediterranean are recorded near three\r\nthousand years ago. \"There went forth a wind from the Lord and brought\r\nquails from the sea, and let them fall upon the camp, a day's journey round\r\nabout it, and they were two cubits above the earth,\" (Numbers, chap. ii.\r\nver. 31.)\r\n\r\nIn our country, Mr. Pennant informs us, that some quails migrate, and\r\nothers only remove from the internal parts of the island to the coasts,\r\n(Zoology, octavo, 210.) Some of the ringdoves and stares breed here, others\r\nmigrate, (ibid. 510, ii.) And the slender billed small birds do not all\r\nquit these kingdoms in the winter, though the difficulty of procuring the\r\nworms and insects, that they feed on, supplies the same reason for\r\nmigration to them all, (ibid. 511.)\r\n\r\nLinnæus has observed, that in Sweden the female chaffinches quit that\r\ncountry in September, migrating into Holland, and leave their mates behind\r\ntill their return in spring. Hence he has called them Fringilla cælebs,\r\n(Amæn. Acad. ii. 42. iv. 595.) Now in our climate both sexes of them are\r\nperennial birds. And Mr. Pennant observes that the hoopoe, chatterer,\r\nhawfinch, and crossbill, migrate into England so rarely, and at such\r\nuncertain times, as not to deserve to be ranked among our birds of passage,\r\n(ibid. 511.)\r\n\r\nThe water fowl, as geese and ducks, are better adapted for long migrations,\r\nthan the other tribes of birds, as, when the weather is calm, they can not\r\nonly rest themselves, or sleep upon the ocean, but possibly procure some\r\nkind of food from it.\r\n\r\nHence in Siberia, as soon as the lakes are frozen, the water fowl, which\r\nare very numerous, all disappear, and are supposed to fly to warmer\r\nclimates, except the rail, which, from its inability for long flights,\r\nprobably sleeps, like our bat, in their winter. The following account from\r\nthe Journey of Professor Gmelin, may entertain the reader. \"In the\r\nneighbourhood of Krasnoiark, amongst many other emigrant water fowls, we\r\nobserved a great number of rails, which when pursued never took flight, but\r\nendeavoured to escape by running. We enquired how these birds, that could\r\nnot fly, could retire into other countries in the winter, and were told,\r\nboth by the Tartars and Assanians, that they well knew those birds could\r\nnot alone pass into other countries: but when the cranes (les grues) retire\r\nin autumn, each one takes a rail (un rale) upon his back, and carries him\r\nto a warmer climate.\"\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\n1. All birds of passage can exist in the climates, where they are produced.\r\n\r\n2. They are subject in their migrations to the same accidents and\r\ndifficulties, that mankind are subject to in navigation.\r\n\r\n3. The same species of birds migrate from some countries, and are resident\r\nin others.\r\n\r\nFrom all these circumstances it appears that the migrations of birds are\r\nnot produced by a necessary instinct, but are accidental improvements, like\r\nthe arts among mankind, taught by their cotemporaries, or delivered by\r\ntradition from one generation of them to another.\r\n\r\nXIII. In that season of the year which supplies the nourishment proper for\r\nthe expected brood, the birds enter into a contract of marriage, and with\r\njoint labour construct a bed for the reception of their offspring. Their\r\nchoice of the proper season, their contracts of marriage, and the\r\nregularity with which they construct their nests, have in all ages excited\r\nthe admiration of naturalists; and have always been attributed to the power\r\nof instinct, which, like the occult qualities of the antient philosophers,\r\nprevented all further enquiry. We shall consider them in their order.\r\n\r\n_Their Choice of the Season._\r\n\r\nOur domestic birds, that are plentifully supplied throughout the year with\r\ntheir adapted food, and are covered with houses from the inclemency of the\r\nweather, lay their eggs at any season: which evinces that the spring of the\r\nyear is not pointed out to them by a necessary instinct.\r\n\r\nWhilst the wild tribes of birds choose this time of the year from their\r\nacquired knowledge, that the mild temperature of the air is more convenient\r\nfor hatching their eggs, and is soon likely to supply that kind of\r\nnourishment, that is wanted for their young.\r\n\r\nIf the genial warmth of the spring produced the passion of love, as it\r\nexpands the foliage of trees, all other animals should feel its influence\r\nas well as birds: but, the viviparous creatures, as they suckle their\r\nyoung, that is, as they previously digest the natural food, that it may\r\nbetter suit the tender stomachs of their offspring, experience the\r\ninfluence of this passion at all seasons of the year, as cats and bitches.\r\nThe graminivorous animals indeed generally produce their young about the\r\ntime when grass is supplied in the greatest plenty, but this is without any\r\ndegree of exactness, as appears from our cows, sheep, and hares, and may be\r\na part of the traditional knowledge, which they learn from the example of\r\ntheir parents.\r\n\r\n_Their Contracts of Marriage._\r\n\r\nTheir mutual passion, and the acquired knowledge, that their joint labour\r\nis necessary to procure sustenance for their numerous family, induces the\r\nwild birds to enter into a contract of marriage, which does not however\r\ntake place among the ducks, geese, and fowls, that are provided with their\r\ndaily food from our barns.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious philosopher has lately denied, that animals can enter into\r\ncontracts, and thinks this an essential difference between them and the\r\nhuman creature:--but does not daily observation convince us, that they form\r\ncontracts of friendship with each other, and with mankind? When puppies and\r\nkittens play together, is there not a tacit contract, that they will not\r\nhurt each other? And does not your favorite dog expect you should give him\r\nhis daily food, for his services and attention to you? And thus barters his\r\nlove for your protection? In the same manner that all contracts are made\r\namongst men, that do not understand each others arbitrary language.\r\n\r\n_Construction of their Nests._\r\n\r\n1. They seem to be instructed how to build their nests from their\r\nobservation of that, in which they were educated, and from their knowledge\r\nof those things, that are most agreeable to their touch in respect: to\r\nwarmth, cleanliness, and stability. They choose their situations from their\r\nideas of safety from their enemies, and of shelter from the weather. Nor is\r\nthe colour of their nests a circumstance unthought of; the finches, that\r\nbuild in green hedges, cover their habitations with green moss; the swallow\r\nor martin, that builds against rocks and houses, covers her's with clay,\r\nwhilst the lark chooses vegetable straw nearly of the colour of the ground\r\nshe inhabits: by this contrivance, they are all less liable to be\r\ndiscovered by their adversaries.\r\n\r\n2. Nor are the nests of the same species of birds constructed always of the\r\nsame materials, nor in the same form; which is another circumstance that\r\nascertains, that they are led by observation.\r\n\r\nIn the trees before Mr. Levet's house in Lichfield, there are annually\r\nnests built by sparrows, a bird which usually builds under the tiles of\r\nhouses, or the thatch of barns. Not finding such convenient situations for\r\ntheir nests, they build a covered nest bigger than a man's head, with an\r\nopening like a mouth at the side, resembling that of a magpie, except that\r\nit is built with straw and hay, and lined with feathers, and so nicely\r\nmanaged as to be a defence against both wind and rain.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a Letter of the Rev. Mr. J. Darwin, of Carleton\r\nScroop in Lincolnshire, authenticates a curious fact of this kind. \"When I\r\nmentioned to you the circumstance of crows or rooks building in the spire\r\nof Welbourn church, you expressed a desire of being well informed of the\r\ncertainty of the fact. Welbourn is situated in the road from Grantham to\r\nLincoln on the Cliff row; I yesterday took a ride thither, and enquired of\r\nthe rector, Mr. Ridgehill, whether the report was true, that rooks built in\r\nthe spire of his church. He assured me it was true, and that they had done\r\nso time immemorial, as his parishioners affirmed. There was a common\r\ntradition, he said, that formerly a rookery in some high trees adjoined the\r\nchurch yard, which being cut down (probably in the spring, the building\r\nseason), the rooks removed to the church, and built their nests on the\r\noutside of the spire on the tops of windows, which by their projection a\r\nlittle from the spire made them convenient room, but that they built also\r\non the inside. I saw two nests made with sticks on the outside, and in the\r\nspires, and Mr. Ridgehill said there were always a great many.\r\n\r\n\"I spent the day with Mr. Wright, a clergyman, at Fulbeck, near Welbourn,\r\nand in the afternoon Dr. Ellis of Headenham, about two miles from Welbourn,\r\ndrank tea at Mr. Wright's, who said he remembered, when Mr. Welby lived at\r\nWelbourn, that he received a letter from an acquaintance in the west of\r\nEngland, desiring an answer, whether the report of rooks building in\r\nWelbourn church was true, as a wager was depending on that subject; to\r\nwhich he returned an answer ascertaining the fact, and decided the wager.\"\r\nAug. 30, 1794.\r\n\r\nSo the jackdaw (corvus monedula) generally builds in church-steeples, or\r\nunder the roofs of high houses; but at Selbourn, in Southamptonshire, where\r\ntowers and steeples are not sufficiently numerous, these birds build in\r\nforsaken rabbit burrows. See a curious account of these subterranean nests\r\nin White's History of Selbourn, p. 59. Can the skilful change of\r\narchitecture in these birds and the sparrows above mentioned be governed by\r\ninstinct? Then they must have two instincts, one for common, and the other\r\nfor extraordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nI have seen green worsted in a nest, which no where exists in nature: and\r\nthe down of thistles in those nests, that were by some accident constructed\r\nlater in the summer, which material could not be procured for the earlier\r\nnests: in many different climates they cannot procure the same materials,\r\nthat they use in ours. And it is well known, that the canary birds, that\r\nare propagated in this country, and the finches, that are kept tame, will\r\nbuild their nests of any flexile materials, that are given them. Plutarch,\r\nin his Book on Rivers, speaking of the Nile, says, \"that the swallows\r\ncollect a material, when the waters recede, with which they form nests,\r\nthat are impervious to water.\" And in India there is a swallow that\r\ncollects a glutinous substance for this purpose, whose nest is esculent,\r\nand esteemed a principal rarity amongst epicures, (Lin. Syst. Nat.) Both\r\nthese must be constructed of very different materials from those used by\r\nthe swallows of our country.\r\n\r\nIn India the birds exert more artifice in building their nests on account\r\nof the monkeys and snakes: some form their pensile nests in the shape of a\r\npurse, deep and open at top; others with a hole in the side; and others,\r\nstill more cautious, with an entrance at the very bottom, forming their\r\nlodge near the summit. But the taylor-bird will not ever trust its nest to\r\nthe extremity of a tender twig, but makes one more advance to safety by\r\nfixing it to the leaf itself. It picks up a dead leaf, and sews it to the\r\nside of a living one, its slender bill being its needle, and its thread\r\nsome fine fibres; the lining consists of feathers, gossamer, and down; its\r\neggs are white, the colour of the bird light yellow, its length three\r\ninches, its weight three sixteenths of an ounce; so that the materials of\r\nthe nest, and the weight of the bird, are not likely to draw down an\r\nhabitation so slightly suspended. A nest of this bird is preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum, (Pennant's Indian Zoology). This calls to one's mind the\r\nMosaic account of the origin of mankind, the first dawning of art there\r\nascribed to them, is that of sewing leaves together. For many other curious\r\nkinds of nests see Natural History for Children, by Mr. Galton. Johnson.\r\nLondon. Part I. p. 47. Gen. Oriolus.\r\n\r\n3. Those birds that are brought up by our care, and have had little\r\ncommunication with others of their own species, are very defective in this\r\nacquired knowledge; they are not only very awkward in the construction of\r\ntheir nests, but generally scatter their eggs in various parts of the room\r\nor cage, where they are confined, and seldom produce young ones, till, by\r\nfailing in their first attempt, they have learnt something from their own\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n4. During the time of incubation birds are said in general to turn their\r\neggs every day; some cover them, when they leave the nest, as ducks and\r\ngeese; in some the male is said to bring food to the female, that she may\r\nhave less occasion of absence, in others he is said to take her place, when\r\nshe goes in quest of food; and all of them are said to leave their eggs a\r\nshorter time in cold weather than in warm. In Senegal the ostrich sits on\r\nher eggs only during the night, leaving them in the day to the heat of the\r\nsun; but at the Cape of Good Hope, where the heat is less, she sits on them\r\nday and night.\r\n\r\nIf it should be asked, what induces a bird to sit weeks on its first eggs\r\nunconscious that a brood of young ones will be the product? The answer must\r\nbe, that it is the same passion that induces the human mother to hold her\r\noffspring whole nights and days in her fond arms, and press it to her\r\nbosom, unconscious of its future growth to sense and manhood, till\r\nobservation or tradition have informed her.\r\n\r\n5. And as many ladies are too refined to nurse their own children, and\r\ndeliver them to the care and provision of others; so is there one instance\r\nof this vice in the feathered world. The cuckoo in some parts of England,\r\nas I am well informed by a very distinct and ingenious gentleman, hatches\r\nand educates her own young; whilst in other parts she builds no nest, but\r\nuses that of some lesser bird, generally either of the wagtail, or hedge\r\nsparrow, and depositing one egg in it, takes no further care of her\r\nprogeny.\r\n\r\nAs the Rev. Mr. Stafford was walking in Glosop Dale, in the Peak of\r\nDerbyshire, he saw a cuckoo rise from its nest. The nest was on the stump\r\nof a tree, that had been some time felled, among some chips that were in\r\npart turned grey, so as much to resemble the colour of the bird, in this\r\nnest were two young cuckoos: tying a string about the leg of one of them,\r\nhe pegged the other end of it to the ground, and very frequently for many\r\ndays beheld the old cuckoo feed these her young, as he stood very near\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a Letter from the Rev. Mr. Wilmot, of Morley, near\r\nDerby, strengthens the truth of the fact above mentioned, of the cuckoo\r\nsometimes making a nest, and hatching her own young.\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning of July 1792, I was attending some labourers on my farm,\r\nwhen one of them said to me, \"There is a bird's nest upon one of the\r\nCoal-slack Hills; the bird is now sitting, and is exactly like a cuckoo.\r\nThey say that cuckoo's never hatch their own eggs, otherwise I should have\r\nsworn it was one.\" He took me to the spot, it was in an open fallow ground;\r\nthe bird was upon the nest, I stood and observed her some time, and was\r\nperfectly satisfied it was a cuckoo; I then put my hand towards her, and\r\nshe almost let me touch her before she rose from the nest, which she\r\nappeared to quit with great uneasiness, skimming over the ground in the\r\nmanner that a hen partridge does when disturbed from a new hatched brood,\r\nand went only to a thicket about forty or fifty yards from the nest; and\r\ncontinued there as long as I staid to observe her, which was not many\r\nminutes. In the nest, which was barely a hole scratched out of the\r\ncoal-slack in the manner of a plover's nest, I observed three eggs, but did\r\nnot touch them. As I had labourers constantly at work in that field, I went\r\nthither every day, and always looked to see if the bird was there, but did\r\nnot disturb her for seven or eight days, when I was tempted to drive her\r\nfrom the nest, and found _two_ young ones, that appeared to have been\r\nhatched some days, but there was no appearance of the third egg. I then\r\nmentioned this extraordinary circumstance (for such I thought it) to Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Holyoak of Bidford Grange, Warwickshire, and to Miss M. Willes,\r\nwho were on a visit at my house, and who all went to see it. Very lately I\r\nreminded Mr. Holyoak of it, who told me he had a perfect recollection of\r\nthe whole, and that, considering it a curiosity, he walked to look at it\r\nseveral times, was perfectly satisfied as to its being a cuckoo, and\r\nthought her more attentive to her young, than any other bird he ever\r\nobserved, having always found her brooding her young. In about a week after\r\nI first saw the young ones, one of them was missing, and I rather suspected\r\nmy plough-boys having taken it; though it might possibly have been taken by\r\na hawk, some time when the old one was seeking food. I never found her off\r\nher nest but once, and that was the last time I saw the remaining young\r\none, when it was almost full feathered. I then went from home for two or\r\nthree days, and, when I returned, the young one was gone, which I take for\r\ngranted had flown. Though during this time I frequently saw cuckoos in the\r\nthicket I mention, I never observed any one, that I supposed to be the\r\ncock-bird, paired with this hen.\"\r\n\r\nNor is this a new observation, though it is entirely overlooked by the\r\nmodern naturalists, for Aristotle speaking of the cuckoo, asserts that she\r\nsometimes builds her nest among broken rocks, and on high mountains, (L. 6.\r\nH. c. 1.) but adds in another place that she generally possesses the nest\r\nof another bird, (L. 6. H. c. 7.) And Niphus says that cuckoos rarely build\r\nfor themselves, most frequently laying their eggs in the nests of other\r\nbirds, (Gesner, L. 3. de Cuculo.)\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher who is acquainted with these facts concerning the cuckoo,\r\nwould seem to have very little _reason_ himself, if he could imagine this\r\nneglect of her young to be a necessary _instinct_!\r\n\r\nXIV. The deep recesses of the ocean are inaccessible to mankind, which\r\nprevents us from having much knowledge of the arts and government of its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n1. One of the baits used by the fisherman is an animal called an Old\r\nSoldier, his size and form are somewhat like the craw-fish, with this\r\ndifference, that his tail is covered with a tough membrane instead of a\r\nshell; and to obviate this defect, he seeks out the uninhabited shell of\r\nsome dead fish, that is large enough to receive his tail, and carries it\r\nabout with him as part of his clothing or armour.\r\n\r\n2. On the coasts about Scarborough, where the haddocks, cods, and dog-fish,\r\nare in great abundance, the fishermen universally believe that the dog-fish\r\nmake a line, or semicircle, to encompass a shoal of haddocks and cod,\r\nconfining them within certain limits near the shore, and eating them as\r\noccasion requires. For the haddocks and cod are always found near the shore\r\nwithout any dog-fish among them, and the dog-fish further off without any\r\nhaddocks or cod; and yet the former are known to prey upon the latter, and\r\nin some years devour such immense quantities as to render this fishery more\r\nexpensive than profitable.\r\n\r\n3. The remora, when he wishes to remove his situation, as he is a very slow\r\nswimmer, is content to take an outside place on whatever conveyance is\r\ngoing his way; nor can the cunning animal be tempted to quit his hold of a\r\nship when she is sailing, not even for the lucre of a piece of pork, lest\r\nit should endanger the loss of his passage: at other times he is easily\r\ncaught with the hook.\r\n\r\n4. The crab-fish, like many other testaceous animals, annually changes its\r\nshell; it is then in a soft state, covered only with a mucous membrane, and\r\nconceals itself in holes in the sand or under weeds; at this place a hard\r\nshelled crab always stands centinel, to prevent the sea insects from\r\ninjuring the other in its defenceless state; and the fishermen from his\r\nappearance know where to find the soft ones, which they use for baits in\r\ncatching other fish.\r\n\r\nAnd though the hard shelled crab, when he is on this duty, advances boldly\r\nto meet the foe, and will with difficulty quit the field; yet at other\r\ntimes he shews great timidity, and has a wonderful speed in attempting his\r\nescape; and, if often interrupted, will pretend death like the spider, and\r\nwatch an opportunity to sink himself into the sand, keeping only his eyes\r\nabove. My ingenious friend Mr. Burdett, who favoured me with these accounts\r\nat the time he was surveying the coasts, thinks the commerce between the\r\nsexes takes place at this time, and inspires the courage of the creature.\r\n\r\n5. The shoals of herrings, cods, haddocks, and other fish, which approach\r\nour shores at certain seasons, and quit them at other seasons without\r\nleaving one behind; and the salmon, that periodically frequent our rivers,\r\nevince, that there are vagrant tribes of fish, that perform as regular\r\nmigrations as the birds of passage already mentioned.\r\n\r\n6. There is a cataract on the river Liffey in Ireland about nineteen feet\r\nhigh: here in the salmon season many of the inhabitants amuse themselves in\r\nobserving these fish leap up the torrent. They dart themselves quite out of\r\nthe water as they ascend, and frequently fall back many times before they\r\nsurmount it, and baskets made of twigs are placed near the edge of the\r\nstream to catch them in their fall.\r\n\r\nI have observed, as I have sat by a spout of water, which descends from a\r\nstone trough about two feet into a stream below, at particular seasons of\r\nthe year, a great number of little fish called minums, or pinks, throw\r\nthemselves about twenty times their own length out of the water, expecting\r\nto get into the trough above.\r\n\r\nThis evinces that the storgee, or attention of the dam to provide for the\r\noffspring, is strongly exerted amongst the nations of fish, where it would\r\nseem to be the most neglected; as these salmon cannot be supposed to\r\nattempt so difficult and dangerous a task without being conscious of the\r\npurpose or end of their endeavours.\r\n\r\nIt is further remarkable, that most of the old salmon return to the sea\r\nbefore it is proper for the young shoals to attend them, yet that a few old\r\nones continue in the rivers so late, that they become perfectly emaciated\r\nby the inconvenience of their situation, and this apparently to guide or to\r\nprotect the unexperienced brood.\r\n\r\nOf the smaller water animals we have still less knowledge, who nevertheless\r\nprobably possess many superior arts; some of these are mentioned in Botanic\r\nGarden, P. I. Add. Note XXVII. and XXVIII. The nympha of the water-moths of\r\nour rivers, which cover themselves with cases of straw, gravel, and shell,\r\ncontrive to make their habitations, nearly in equilibrium with the water;\r\nwhen too heavy, they add a bit of wood or straw; when too light, a bit of\r\ngravel. Edinb. Trans.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances bear a near resemblance to the deliberate actions\r\nof human reason.\r\n\r\nXV. We have a very imperfect acquaintance with the various tribes of\r\ninsects: their occupations, manner of life, and even the number of their\r\nsenses, differ from our own, and from each other; but there is reason to\r\nimagine, that those which possess the sense of touch in the most exquisite\r\ndegree, and whole occupations require the most constant exertion of their\r\npowers, are induced with a greater proportion or knowledge and ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe spiders of this country manufacture nets of various forms, adapted to\r\nvarious situations, to arrest the flies that are their food; and some of\r\nthem have a house or lodging-place in the middle of the net, well contrived\r\nfor warmth, security, or concealment. There is a large spider in South\r\nAmerica, who constructs nets of so strong a texture as to entangle small\r\nbirds, particularly the humming bird. And in Jamaica there is another\r\nspider, who digs a hole in the earth obliquely downwards, about three\r\ninches in length, and one inch in diameter, this cavity she lines with a\r\ntough thick web, which when taken out resembles a leathern purse: but what\r\nis most curious, this house has a door with hinges, like the operculum of\r\nsome sea shells; and herself and family, who tenant this nest, open and\r\nshut the door, whenever they pass or repass. This history was told me, and\r\nthe nest with its operculum shewn me by the late Dr. Butt of Bath, who was\r\nsome years physician in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe production of these nets is indeed a part of the nature or conformation\r\nof the animal, and their natural use is to supply the place of wings, when\r\nshe wishes to remove to another situation. But when she employs them to\r\nentangle her prey, there are marks of evident design, for she adapts the\r\nform of each net to its situation, and strengthens those lines, that\r\nrequire it, by joining others to the middle of them, and attaching those\r\nothers to distant objects, with the same individual art, that is used by\r\nmankind in supporting the masts and extending the sails of ships. This work\r\nis executed with more mathematical exactness and ingenuity by the field\r\nspiders, than by those in our houses, as their constructions are more\r\nsubjected to the injuries of dews and tempests.\r\n\r\nBesides the ingenuity shewn by these little creatures in taking their prey,\r\nthe circumstance of their counterfeiting death, when they are put into\r\nterror, is truly wonderful; and as soon as the object of terror is removed,\r\nthey recover and run away. Some beetles are also said to possess this piece\r\nof hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe curious webs, or chords, constructed by some young caterpillars to\r\ndefend themselves from cold, or from insects of prey; and by silk-worms and\r\nsome other caterpillars, when they transmigrate into aureliæ or larvæ, have\r\ndeservedly excited the admiration of the inquisitive. But our ignorance of\r\ntheir manner of life, and even of the number of their senses, totally\r\nprecludes us from understanding the means by which they acquire this\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe care of the salmon in choosing a proper situation for her spawn, the\r\nstructure of the nests of birds, their patient incubation, and the art of\r\nthe cuckoo in depositing her egg in her neighbour's nursery, are instances\r\nof great sagacity in those creatures: and yet they are much inferior to the\r\narts exerted by many of the insect tribes on similar occasions. The hairy\r\nexcrescences on briars, the oak apples, the blasted leaves of trees, and\r\nthe lumps on the backs of cows, are situations that are rather produced\r\nthan chosen by the mother insect for the convenience of her offspring. The\r\ncells of bees, wasps, spiders, and of the various coralline insects,\r\nequally astonish us, whether we attend to the materials or to the\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nBut the conduct of the ant, and of some species of the ichneumon fly in the\r\nincubation of their eggs, is equal to any exertion of human science. The\r\nants many times in a day move their eggs nearer the surface of their\r\nhabitation, or deeper below it, as the heat of the weather varies; and in\r\ncolder days lie upon them in heaps for the purpose of incubation: if their\r\nmansion is too dry, they carry them to places where there is moisture, and\r\nyou may distinctly see the little worms move and suck up the water. When\r\ntoo much moisture approaches their nest, they convey their eggs deeper in\r\nthe earth, or to some other place of safety. (Swammerd. Epil. ad Hist.\r\nInsects, p. 153. Phil. Trans. No. 23. Lowthrop. V. 2. p. 7.)\r\n\r\nThere is one species of ichneumon-fly, that digs a hole in the earth, and\r\ncarrying into it two or three living caterpillars, deposits her eggs, and\r\nnicely closing up the nest leaves them there; partly doubtless to assist\r\nthe incubation, and partly to supply food to her future young, (Derham. B.\r\n4, c. 13. Aristotle Hist. Animal, L. 5. c. 20.)\r\n\r\nA friend of mine put about fifty large caterpillars collected from cabbages\r\non some bran and a few leaves into a box, and covered it with gauze to\r\nprevent their escape. After a few days we saw, from more than three fourths\r\nof them, about eight or ten little caterpillars of the ichneumon-fly come\r\nout of their backs, and spin each a small cocoon of silk, and in a few days\r\nthe large caterpillars died. This small fly it seems lays its egg in the\r\nback of the cabbage caterpillar, which when hatched preys upon the\r\nmaterial, which is produced there for the purpose of making silk for the\r\nfuture nest of the cabbage caterpillar; of which being deprived, the\r\ncreature wanders about till it dies, and thus our gardens are preserved by\r\nthe ingenuity of this cruel fly. This curious property of producing a silk\r\nthread, which is common to some sea animals, see Botanic Garden, Part I.\r\nNote XXVII. and is designed for the purpose of their transformation as in\r\nthe silk-worm, is used for conveying themselves from higher branches to\r\nlower ones of trees by some caterpillars, and to make themselves temporary\r\nnests or tents, and by the spider for entangling his prey. Nor is it\r\nstrange that so much knowledge should be acquired by such small animals;\r\nsince there is reason to imagine, that these insects have the sense of\r\ntouch, either in their proboscis, or their antennæ, to a great degree of\r\nperfection; and thence may possess, as far as their sphere extends, as\r\naccurate knowledge, and as subtle invention, as the discoverers of human\r\narts.\r\n\r\nXVI. 1. If we were better acquainted with the histories of those insects\r\nthat are formed into societies, as the bees, wasps, and ants, I make no\r\ndoubt but we should find, that their arts and improvements are not so\r\nsimilar and uniform as they now appear to us, but that they arose in the\r\nsame manner from experience and tradition, as the arts of our own species;\r\nthough their reasoning is from fewer ideas, is busied about fewer objects,\r\nand is exerted with less energy.\r\n\r\nThere are some kinds of insects that migrate like the birds before\r\nmentioned. The locust of warmer climates has sometimes come over to\r\nEngland; it is shaped like a grasshopper, with very large wings, and a body\r\nabove an inch in length. It is mentioned as coming into Egypt with an east\r\nwind, \"The lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and night,\r\nand in the morning the east wind brought the locusts, and covered the face\r\nof the earth, so that the land was dark,\" Exod. x. 13. The migrations of\r\nthese insects are mentioned in another part of the scripture, \"The locusts\r\nhave no king, yet go they forth all of them in bands,\" Prov. xxx. 27.\r\n\r\nThe accurate Mr. Adanson, near the river Gambia in Africa, was witness to\r\nthe migration of these insects. \"About eight in the morning, in the month\r\nof February, there suddenly arose over our heads a thick cloud, which\r\ndarkened the air, and deprived us of the rays of the sun. We found it was a\r\ncloud of locusts raised about twenty or thirty fathoms from the ground, and\r\ncovering an extent of several leagues; at length a shower of these insects\r\ndescended, and after devouring every green herb, while they rested, again\r\nresumed their flight. This cloud was brought by a strong east-wind, and was\r\nall the morning in passing over the adjacent country.\" (Voyage to Senegal,\r\n158.)\r\n\r\nIn this country the gnats are sometimes seen to migrate in clouds, like the\r\nmusketoes of warmer climates, and our swarms of bees frequently travel many\r\nmiles, and are said in North America always to fly towards the south. The\r\nprophet Isaiah has a beautiful allusion to these migrations, \"The Lord\r\nshall call the fly from the rivers of Egypt, and shall hiss for the bee\r\nthat is in the land of Assyria,\" Isa. vii. 18. which has been lately\r\nexplained by Mr. Bruce, in his travels to discover the source of the Nile.\r\n\r\n2. I am well informed that the bees that were carried into Barbadoes, and\r\nother western islands, ceased to lay up any honey after the first year, as\r\nthey found it not useful to them: and are now become very troublesome to\r\nthe inhabitants of those islands by infesting their sugar houses; but those\r\nin Jamaica continue to make honey, as the cold north winds, or rainy\r\nseasons of that island, confine them at home for several weeks together.\r\nAnd the bees of Senegal, which differ from those of Europe only in size,\r\nmake their honey not only superior to ours in delicacy of flavour, but it\r\nhas this singularity, that it never concretes, but remains liquid as syrup,\r\n(Adanson). From some observations of Mr. Wildman, and of other people of\r\nveracity, it appears, that during the severe part of the winter season for\r\nweeks together the bees are quite benumbed and torpid from the cold, and do\r\nnot consume any of their provision. This state of sleep, like that of\r\nswallows and bats, seems to be the natural resource of those creatures in\r\ncold climates, and the making of honey to be an artificial improvement.\r\n\r\nAs the death of our hives of bees appears to be owning to their being kept\r\nso warm, as to require food when their stock is exhausted; a very observing\r\ngentleman at my request put two hives for many weeks into a dry cellar, and\r\nobserved, during all that time, they did not consume any of their\r\nprovision, for their weight did not decrease as it had done when they were\r\nkept in the open air. The same observation is made in the Annual Register\r\nfor 1768, p. 113. And the Rev. Mr. White, in his Method of preserving Bees,\r\nadds, that those on the north side of his house consumed less honey in the\r\nwinter than those on the south side.\r\n\r\nThere is another observation on bees well ascertained, that they at various\r\ntimes, when the season begins to be cold, by a general motion of their legs\r\nas they hang in clusters produce a degree of warmth, which is easily\r\nperceptible by the hand. Hence by this ingenious exertion, they for a long\r\ntime prevent the torpid state they would naturally fall into.\r\n\r\nAccording to the late observations of Mr. Hunter, it appears that the\r\nbee's-wax is not made from the dust of the anthers of flowers, which they\r\nbring home on their thighs, but that this makes what is termed bee-bread,\r\nand is used for the purpose of feeding the bee-maggots; in the same manner\r\nbutterflies live on honey, but the previous caterpillar lives on vegetable\r\nleaves, while the maggots of large flies require flesh for their food, and\r\nthose of the ichneumon fly require insects for their food. What induces the\r\nbee who lives on honey to lay up vegetable powder for its young? What\r\ninduces the butterfly to lay its eggs on leaves, when itself feeds on\r\nhoney? What induces the other flies to seek a food for their progeny\r\ndifferent from what they consume themselves? If these are not deductions\r\nfrom their own previous experience or observation, all the actions of\r\nmankind must be resolved into instinct.\r\n\r\n3. The dormouse consumes but little of its food during the rigour of the\r\nseason, for they roll themselves up, or sleep, or lie torpid the greatest\r\npart of the time; but on warm sunny days experience a short revival, and\r\ntake a little food, and then relapse into their former state.\" (Pennant\r\nZoolog. p. 67.) Other animals, that sleep in winter without laying up any\r\nprovender, are observed to go into their winter beds fat and strong, but\r\nreturn to day-light in the spring season very lean and feeble. The common\r\nflies sleep during the winter without any provision for their nourishment,\r\nand are daily revived by the warmth of the sun, or of our fires. These\r\nwhenever they see light endeavour to approach it, having observed, that by\r\nits greater vicinity they get free from the degree of torpor, that the cold\r\nproduces; and are hence induced perpetually to burn themselves in our\r\ncandles: deceived, like mankind, by the misapplication of their knowledge.\r\nWhilst many of the subterraneous insects, as the common worms, seem to\r\nretreat so deep into the earth as not to be enlivened or awakened by the\r\ndifference of our winter days; and stop up their holes with leaves or\r\nstraws, to prevent the frosts from injuring them, or the centipes from\r\ndevouring them. The habits of peace, or the stratagems of war, of these\r\nsubterranean nations are covered from our view; but a friend of mine\r\nprevailed on a distressed worm to enter the hole of another worm on a\r\nbowling-green, and he presently returned much wounded about his head. And I\r\nonce saw a worm rise hastily out of the earth into the sunshine, and\r\nobserved a centipes hanging at its tail: the centipes nimbly quitted the\r\ntail, and seizing the worm about its middle cut it in half with its\r\nforceps, and preyed upon one part, while the other escaped. Which evinces\r\nthey have design in stopping the mouths of their habitations.\r\n\r\n4. The wasp of this country fixes his habitation under ground, that he may\r\nnot be affected with the various changes of our climate; but in Jamaica he\r\nhangs it on the bough of a tree, where the seasons are less severe. He\r\nweaves a very curious paper of vegetable fibres to cover his nest, which is\r\nconstructed on the same principle with that of the bee, but with a\r\ndifferent material; but as his prey consists of flesh, fruits, and insects,\r\nwhich are perishable commodities, he can lay up no provender for the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nM. de la Loubiere, in his relation of Siam, says, \"That in a part of that\r\nkingdom, which lies open to great inundations, all the ants make their\r\nsettlements upon trees; no ants' nests are to be seen any where else.\"\r\nWhereas in our country the ground is their only situation. From the\r\nscriptual account of these insects, one might be led to suspect, that in\r\nsome climates they lay up a provision for the winter. Origen affirms the\r\nsame, (Cont. Cels. L. 4.) But it is generally believed that in this country\r\nthey do not, (Prov. vi. 6. xxx. 25.) The white ants of the coast of Africa\r\nmake themselves pyramids eight or ten feet high, on a base of about the\r\nsame width, with a smooth surface of rich clay, excessively hard and well\r\nbuilt, which appear at a distance like an assemblage of the huts of the\r\nnegroes, (Adanson). The history of these has been lately well described in\r\nthe Philosoph. Transactions, under the name of termes, or termites. These\r\ndiffer very much from the nest of our large ant; but the real history of\r\nthis creature, as well as of the wasp, is yet very imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nWasps are said to catch large spiders, and to cut off their legs, and carry\r\ntheir mutilated bodies to their young, Dict. Raison. Tom. I. p. 152.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance I shall relate which fell under my own eye, and shewed the\r\npower or reason in a wasp, as it is exercised among men. A wasp, on a\r\ngravel walk, had caught a fly nearly as large as himself; kneeling on the\r\nground I observed him separate the tail and the head from the body part, to\r\nwhich the wings were attached. He then took the body part in his paws, and\r\nrose about two feet from the ground with it; but a gentle breeze wafting\r\nthe wings of the fly turned him round in the air, and he settled again with\r\nhis prey upon the gravel. I then distinctly observed him cut off with his\r\nmouth, first one of the wings, and then the other, after which he flew away\r\nwith it unmolested by the wind.\r\n\r\nGo, thou sluggard, learn arts and industry from the bee, and from the ant!\r\n\r\nGo, proud reasoner, and call the worm thy sister!\r\n\r\nXVII. _Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIt was before observed how much the superior accuracy of our sense of touch\r\ncontributes to increase our knowledge; but it is the greater energy and\r\nactivity of the power of volition (as explained in the former Sections of\r\nthis work) that marks mankind, and has given him the empire of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is a criterion by which we may distinguish our voluntary acts or\r\nthoughts from those that are excited by our sensations: \"The former are\r\nalways employed about the _means_ to acquire pleasureable objects, or to\r\navoid painful ones: while the latter are employed about the _possession_ of\r\nthose that are already in our power.\"\r\n\r\nIf we turn our eyes upon the fabric of our fellow animals, we find they are\r\nsupported with bones, covered with skins, moved by muscles; that they\r\npossess the same senses, acknowledge the same appetites, and are nourished\r\nby the same aliment with ourselves; and we should hence conclude from the\r\nstrongest analogy, that their internal faculties were also in some measure\r\nsimilar to our own.\r\n\r\nMr. Locke indeed published an opinion, that other animals possessed no\r\nabstract or general ideas, and thought this circumstance was the barrier\r\nbetween the brute and the human world. But these abstracted ideas have been\r\nsince demonstrated by Bishop Berkley, and allowed by Mr. Hume, to have no\r\nexistence in nature, not even in the mind of their inventor, and we are\r\nhence necessitated to look for some other mark of distinction.\r\n\r\nThe ideas and actions of brutes, like those of children, are almost\r\nperpetually produced by their present pleasures, or their present pains;\r\nand, except in the few instances that have been mentioned in this Section,\r\nthey seldom busy themselves about the _means_ of procuring future bliss, or\r\nof avoiding future misery.\r\n\r\nWhilst the acquiring of languages, the making of tools, and the labouring\r\nfor money; which are all only the _means_ of procuring pleasure; and the\r\npraying to the Deity, as another _means_ to procure happiness, are\r\ncharacteristic of human nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

Volition joined with sensation.\r\n    Irritative ideas of sound become sensible._ 7. _Ideas of imagination,\r\n    dissevered by irritations, by volition, production of surprise._\r\n\r\nI. 1. To investigate with precision the catenations of animal motions, it\r\nwould be well to attend to the manner of their production; but we cannot\r\nbegin this disquisition early enough for this purpose, as the catenations\r\nof motion seem to begin with life, and are only extinguishable with it; We\r\nhave spoken of the power of irritation, of sensation, of volition, and of\r\nassociation, as preceding the fibrous motions; we now step forwards, and\r\nconsider, that conversely they are in their turn preceded by those motions;\r\nand that all the successive trains or circles of our actions are composed\r\nof this twofold concatenation. Those we shall call trains of action, which\r\ncontinue to proceed without any stated repetitions; and those circles of\r\naction, when the parts of them return at certain periods, though the\r\ntrains, of which they consist, are not exactly similar. The reading an epic\r\npoem is a train of actions; the reading a song with a chorus at equal\r\ndistances in the measure constitutes so many circles of action.\r\n\r\n2. Some catenations of animal motion are produced by reiterated successive\r\nirritations, as when we learn to repeat the alphabet in its order by\r\nfrequently reading the letters of it. Thus the vermicular motions of the\r\nbowels were originally produced by the successive irritations of the\r\npassing aliment; and the succession of actions of the auricles and\r\nventricles of the heart was originally formed by successive stimulus of the\r\nblood, these afterwards become part of the diurnal circles of animal\r\nactions, as appears by the periodical returns of hunger, and the quickened\r\npulse of weak people in the evening.\r\n\r\nOther catenations of animal motion are gradually acquired by successive\r\nagreeable sensations, as in learning a favourite song or dance; others by\r\ndisagreeable sensations, as in coughing or nictitation; these become\r\nassociated by frequent repetition, and afterwards compose parts of greater\r\ncircles of action like those above mentioned.\r\n\r\nOther catenations of motions are gradually acquired by frequent voluntary\r\nrepetitions; as when we deliberately learn to march, read, fence, or any\r\nmechanic art, the motions of many of our muscles become gradually linked\r\ntogether in trains, tribes, or circles of action. Thus when any one at\r\nfirst begins to use the tools in turning wood or metals in a lathe, he\r\nwills the motions of his hand or fingers, till at length these actions\r\nbecome so connected with the effect, that he seems only to will the point\r\nof the chisel. These are caused by volition, connected by association like\r\nthose above described, and afterwards become parts of our diurnal trains or\r\ncircles of action.\r\n\r\n3. All these catenations of animal motions, are liable to proceed some time\r\nafter they are excited, unless they are disturbed or impeded by other\r\nirritations, sensations, or volitions; and in many instances in spite of\r\nour endeavours to stop them; and this property of animal motions is\r\nprobably the cause of their catenation. Thus when a child revolves some\r\nminute on one foot, the spectra of the ambient objects appear to circulate\r\nround him some time after he falls upon the ground. Thus the palpitation of\r\nthe heart continues some time after the object of fear, which occasioned\r\nit, is removed. The blush of shame, which is an excess of sensation, and\r\nthe glow of anger, which is an excess of volition, continue some time,\r\nthough the affected person finds, that those emotions were caused by\r\nmistaken facts, and endeavours to extinguish their appearance. See Sect.\r\nXII. 1. 5.\r\n\r\n4. When a circle of motions becomes connected, by frequent repetitions as\r\nabove, we can exert our attention strongly on other objects, and the\r\nconcatenated circle of motions will nevertheless proceed in due order; as\r\nwhilst you are thinking on this subject, you use variety of muscles in\r\nwalking about your parlour, or in sitting at your writing-table.\r\n\r\n5. Innumerable catenations of motions may proceed at the same time, without\r\nincommoding each other. Of these are the motions of the heart and arteries;\r\nthose of digestion and glandular secretion; of the ideas, or sensual\r\nmotions; those of progression, and of speaking; the great annual circle of\r\nactions so apparent in birds in their times of breeding and moulting; the\r\nmonthly circles of many female animals; and the diurnal circles of sleeping\r\nand waking, of fulness and inanition.\r\n\r\n6. Some links of successive trains or of synchronous tribes of action may\r\nbe left out without disjoining the whole. Such are our usual trains of\r\nrecollection; after having travelled through an entertaining country, and\r\nviewed many delightful lawns, rolling rivers, and echoing rocks; in the\r\nrecollection of our journey we leave out the many districts, that we\r\ncrossed, which were marked with no peculiar pleasure. Such also are our\r\ncomplex ideas, they are catenated tribes of ideas, which do not perfectly\r\nresemble their correspondent perceptions, because some of the parts are\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n7. If an interrupted circle of actions is not entirely dissevered, it will\r\ncontinue to proceed confusedly, till it comes to the part of the circle,\r\nwhere it was interrupted.\r\n\r\nThe vital motions in a fever from drunkenness, and in other periodical\r\ndiseases, are instances of this circumstance. The accidental inebriate does\r\nnot recover himself perfectly till about the same hour on the succeeding\r\nday. The accustomed drunkard is disordered, if he has not his usual\r\npotation of fermented liquor. So if a considerable part of a connected\r\ntribe of action be disturbed, that whole tribe goes on with confusion, till\r\nthe part of the tribe affected regains its accustomed catenations. So\r\nvertigo produces vomiting, and a great secretion of bile, as in\r\nsea-sickness, all these being parts of the tribe of irritative catenations.\r\n\r\n8. Weaker catenated trains may be dissevered by the sudden exertion of the\r\nstronger. When a child first attempts to walk across a room, call to him,\r\nand he instantly falls upon the ground. So while I am thinking over the\r\nvirtues of my friends, if the tea-kettle spurt out some hot water on my\r\nstocking; the sudden pain breaks the weaker chain of ideas, and introduces\r\na new group of figures of its own. This circumstance is extended to some\r\nunnatural trains of action, which have not been confirmed by long habit; as\r\nthe hiccough, or an ague-fit, which are frequently curable by surprise. A\r\nyoung lady about eleven years old had for five days had a contraction of\r\none muscle in her fore arm, and another in her arm, which occurred four or\r\nfive times every minute; the muscles were seen to leap, but without bending\r\nthe arm. To counteract this new morbid habit, an issue was placed over the\r\nconvulsed muscle of her arm, and an adhesive plaster wrapped tight like a\r\nbandage over the whole fore arm, by which the new motions were immediately\r\ndestroyed, but the means were continued some weeks to prevent a return.\r\n\r\n9. If any circle of actions is dissevered, either by omission of some of\r\nthe links, as in sleep, or by insertion of other links, as in surprise, new\r\ncatenations take place in a greater or less degree. The last link of the\r\nbroken chain of actions becomes connected with the new motion which has\r\nbroken it, or with that which was nearest the link omitted; and these new\r\ncatenations proceed instead of the old ones. Hence the periodic returns of\r\nague-fits, and the chimeras of our dreams.\r\n\r\n10. If a train of actions is dissevered, much effort of volition or\r\nsensation will prevent its being restored. Thus in the common impediment of\r\nspeech, when the association of the motions of the muscles of enunciation\r\nwith the idea of the word to be spoken is disordered, the great voluntary\r\nefforts, which distort the countenance, prevent the rejoining of the broken\r\nassociations. See No. II. 10. of this Section. It is thus likewise\r\nobservable in some inflammations of the bowels, the too strong efforts made\r\nby the muscles to carry forwards the offending material fixes it more\r\nfirmly in its place, and prevents the cure. So in endeavouring to recal to\r\nour memory some particular word of a sentence, if we exert ourselves too\r\nstrongly about it, we are less likely to regain it.\r\n\r\n11. Catenated trains or tribes of action are easier dissevered than\r\ncatenated circles of action. Hence in epileptic fits the synchronous\r\nconnected tribes of action, which keep the body erect, are dissevered, but\r\nthe circle of vital motions continues undisturbed.\r\n\r\n12. Sleep destroys the power of volition, and precludes the stimuli of\r\nexternal objects, and thence dissevers the trains, of which these are a\r\npart; which confirms the other catenations, as those of the vital motions,\r\nsecretions, and absorptions; and produces the new trains of ideas, which\r\nconstitute our dreams.\r\n\r\nII. 1. All the preceding circumstances of the catenations of animal motions\r\nwill be more clearly understood by the following example of a person\r\nlearning music; and when we recollect the variety of mechanic arts, which\r\nare performed by associated trains of muscular actions catenated with the\r\neffects they produce, as in knitting, netting, weaving; and the greater\r\nvariety of associated trains of ideas caused or catenated by volitions or\r\nsensations, as in our hourly modes of reasoning, or imagining, or\r\nrecollecting, we shall gain some idea of the innumerable catenated trains\r\nand circles of action, which form the tenor of our lives, and which began,\r\nand will only cease entirely with them.\r\n\r\n2. When a young lady begins to learn music, she voluntarily applies herself\r\nto the characters of her music-book, and by many repetitions endeavours to\r\ncatenate them with the proportions of sound, of which they are symbols. The\r\nideas excited by the musical characters are slowly connected with the keys\r\nof the harpsichord, and much effort is necessary to produce every note with\r\nthe proper finger, and in its due place and time; till at length a train of\r\nvoluntary exertions becomes catenated with certain irritations. As the\r\nvarious notes by frequent repetitions become connected in the order, in\r\nwhich they are produced, a new catenation of sensitive exertions becomes\r\nmixed with the voluntary ones above described; and not only the musical\r\nsymbols of crotchets and quavers, but the auditory notes and tones at the\r\nsame time, become so many successive or synchronous links in this circle of\r\ncatenated actions.\r\n\r\nAt length the motions of her fingers become catenated with the musical\r\ncharacters; and these no sooner strike the eye, than the finger presses\r\ndown the key without any voluntary attention between them; the activity of\r\nthe hand being connected with the irritation of the figure or place of the\r\nmusical symbol on the retina; till at length by frequent repetitions of the\r\nsame tune the movements of her fingers in playing, and the muscles of the\r\nlarynx in singing, become associated with each other, and form part of\r\nthose intricate trains and circles of catenated motions, according with the\r\nsecond article of the preceding propositions in No. 1. of this Section.\r\n\r\n3. Besides the facility, which by habit attends the execution of this\r\nmusical performance, a curious circumstance occurs, which is, that when our\r\nyoung musician has began a tune, she finds herself inclined to continue it;\r\nand that even when she is carelessly singing alone without attending to her\r\nown song; according with the third preceding article.\r\n\r\n4. At the same time that our young performer continues to play with great\r\nexactness this accustomed tune, she can bend her mind, and that intensely,\r\non some other object, according with the fourth article of the preceding\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript copy of this work was lent to many of my friends at\r\ndifferent times for the purpose of gaining their opinions and criticisms on\r\nmany parts of it, and I found the following anecdote written with a pencil\r\nopposite to this page, but am not certain by whom. \"I remember seeing the\r\npretty young actress, who succeeded Mrs. Arne in the performance of the\r\ncelebrated Padlock, rehearse the musical parts at her harpsichord under the\r\neye of her master with great taste and accuracy; though I observed her\r\ncountenance full of emotion, which I could not account for; at last she\r\nsuddenly burst into tears; for she had all this time been eyeing a beloved\r\ncanary bird, suffering great agonies, which at that instant fell dead from\r\nits perch.\"\r\n\r\n5. At the same time many other catenated circles of action are going on in\r\nthe person of our fair musician, as well as the motions of her fingers,\r\nsuch as the vital motions, respiration, the movements of her eyes and\r\neyelids, and of the intricate muscles of vocality, according with the fifth\r\npreceding article.\r\n\r\n6. If by any strong impression on the mind of our fair musician she should\r\nbe interrupted for a very inconsiderable time, she can still continue her\r\nperformance, according to the sixth article.\r\n\r\n7. If however this interruption be greater, though the chain of actions be\r\nnot dissevered, it proceeds confusedly, and our young performer continues\r\nindeed to play, but in a hurry without accuracy and elegance, till she\r\nbegins the tune again, according to the seventh of the preceding articles.\r\n\r\n8. But if this interruption be still greater, the circle of actions becomes\r\nentirely dissevered, and she finds herself immediately under the necessity\r\nto begin over again to recover the lost catenation, according to the eighth\r\npreceding article.\r\n\r\n9. Or in trying to recover it she will sing some dissonant notes, or strike\r\nsome improper keys, according to the ninth preceding article.\r\n\r\n10. A very remarkable thing attends this breach of catenation, if the\r\nperformer has forgotten some word of her song, the more energy of mind she\r\nuses about it, the more distant is she from regaining it; and artfully\r\nemploys her mind in part on some other object, or endeavours to dull its\r\nperceptions, continuing to repeat, as it were inconsciously, the former\r\npart of the song, that she remembers, in hopes to regain the lost\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\nFor if the activity of the mind itself be more energetic, or takes its\r\nattention more, than the connecting word, which is wanted; it will not\r\nperceive the slighter link of this lost word; as who listens to a feeble\r\nsound, must be very silent and motionless; so that in this case the very\r\nvigour of the mind itself seems to prevent it from regaining the lost\r\ncatenation, as well as the too great exertion in endeavouring to regain it,\r\naccording to the tenth preceding article.\r\n\r\nWe frequently experience, when we are doubtful about the spelling of a\r\nword, that the greater voluntary exertion we use, that is the more\r\nintensely we think about it, the further are we from regaining the lost\r\nassociation between the letters of it, but which readily recurs when we\r\nhave become careless about it. In the same manner, after having for an hour\r\nlaboured to recollect the name of some absent person, it shall seem,\r\nparticularly after sleep, to come into the mind as it were spontaneously;\r\nthat is the word we are in search of, was joined to the preceding one by\r\nassociation; this association being dissevered, we endeavour to recover it\r\nby volition; this very action of the mind strikes our attention more, than\r\nthe faint link of association, and we find it impossible by this means to\r\nretrieve the lost word. After sleep, when volition is entirely suspended,\r\nthe mind becomes capable of perceiving the fainter link of association, and\r\nthe word is regained.\r\n\r\nOn this circumstance depends the impediment of speech before mentioned; the\r\nfirst syllable of a word is causable by volition, but the remainder of it\r\nis in common conversation introduced by its associations with this first\r\nsyllable acquired by long habit. Hence when the mind of the stammerer is\r\nvehemently employed on some idea of ambition of shining, or fear of not\r\nsucceeding, the associations of the motions of the muscles of articulation\r\nwith each other become dissevered by this greater exertion, and he\r\nendeavours in vain by voluntary efforts to rejoin the broken association.\r\nFor this purpose he continues to repeat the first syllable, which is\r\ncausable by volition, and strives in vain, by various distortions of\r\ncountenance, to produce the next links, which are subject to association.\r\nSee Class IV. 3. 1. 1.\r\n\r\n11. After our accomplished musician has acquired great variety of tunes and\r\nsongs, so that some of them begin to cease to be easily recollected, she\r\nfinds progressive trains of musical notes more frequently forgotten, than\r\nthose which are composed of reiterated circles, according with the eleventh\r\npreceding article.\r\n\r\n12. To finish our example with the preceding articles we must at length\r\nsuppose, that our fair performer falls asleep over her harpsichord; and\r\nthus by the suspension of volition, and the exclusion of external stimuli,\r\nshe dissevers the trains and circles of her musical exertions.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Many of these circumstances of catenations of motions receive an\r\neasy explanation from the four following consequences to the seventh law of\r\nanimal causation in Sect. IV. These are, first, that those successions or\r\ncombinations of animal motions, whether they were united by causation,\r\nassociation, or catenation, which have been most frequently repeated,\r\nacquire the strongest connection. Secondly, that of these, those, which\r\nhave been less frequently mixed with other trains or tribes of motion, have\r\nthe strongest connection. Thirdly, that of these, those, which were first\r\nformed, have the strongest connection. Fourthly, that if an animal motion\r\nbe excited by more than one causation, association, or catenation, at the\r\nsame time, it will be performed with greater energy.\r\n\r\n2. Hence also we understand, why the catenations of irritative motions are\r\nmore strongly connected than those of the other classes, where the quantity\r\nof unmixed repetition has been equal; because they were first formed. Such\r\nare those of the secerning and absorbent systems of vessels, where the\r\naction of the gland produces a fluid, which stimulates the mouths of its\r\ncorrespondent absorbents. The associated motions seem to be the next most\r\nstrongly united, from their frequent repetition; and where both these\r\ncircumstances unite, as in the vital motions, their catenations are\r\nindissoluble but by the destruction of the animal.\r\n\r\n3. Where a new link has been introduced into a circle of actions by some\r\naccidental defect of stimulus; if that defect of stimulus be repeated at\r\nthe same part of the circle a second or a third time, the defective motions\r\nthus produced, both by the repeated defect of stimulus and by their\r\ncatenation with the parts of the circle of actions, will be performed with\r\nless and less energy. Thus if any person is exposed to cold at a certain\r\nhour to-day, so long as to render some part of the system for a time\r\ntorpid; and is again exposed to it at the same hour to-morrow, and the next\r\nday; he will be more and more affected by it, till at length a cold fit of\r\nfever is completely formed, as happens at the beginning of many of those\r\nfevers, which are called nervous or low fevers. Where the patient has\r\nslight periodical shiverings and paleness for many days before the febrile\r\nparoxysm is completely formed.\r\n\r\n4. On the contrary, if the exposure to cold be for so short a time, as not\r\nto induce any considerable degree of torpor or quiescence, and is repeated\r\ndaily as above mentioned, it loses its effect more and more at every\r\nrepetition, till the constitution can bear it without inconvenience, or\r\nindeed without being conscious of it. As in walking into the cold air in\r\nfrosty weather. The same rule is applicable to increased stimulus, as of\r\nheat, or of vinous spirit, within certain limits, as is applied in the two\r\nlast paragraphs to Deficient Stimulus; as is further explained in Sect.\r\nXXXVI. on the Periods of Diseases.\r\n\r\n5. Where irritation coincides with sensation to produce the same\r\ncatenations of motion, as in inflammatory fevers, they are excited with\r\nstill greater energy than by the irritation alone. So when children expect\r\nto be tickled in play, by a feather lightly passed over the lips, or by\r\ngently vellicating the soles of their feet, laughter is most vehemently\r\nexcited; though they can stimulate these parts with their own fingers\r\nunmoved. Here the pleasureable idea of playfulness coincides with the\r\nvellication; and there is no voluntary exertion used to diminish the\r\nsensation, as there would be, if a child should endeavour to tickle\r\nhimself. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.\r\n\r\n6. And lastly, the motions excited by the junction of voluntary exertion\r\nwith irritation are performed with more energy, than those by irritation\r\nsingly; as when we listen to small noises, as to the ticking of a watch in\r\nthe night, we perceive the most weak sounds, that are at other times\r\nunheeded. So when we attend to the irritative ideas of sound in our ears,\r\nwhich are generally not attended to, we can hear them; and can see the\r\nspectra of objects, which remain in the eye, whenever we please to exert\r\nour voluntary power in aid of those weak actions of the retina, or of the\r\nauditory nerve.\r\n\r\n7. The temporary catenations of ideas, which are caused by the sensations\r\nof pleasure or pain, are easily dissevered either by irritations, as when a\r\nsudden noise disturbs a day-dream; or by the power of volition, as when we\r\nawake from sleep. Hence in our waking hours, whenever an idea occurs, which\r\nis incongruous to our former experience, we instantly dissever the train of\r\nimagination by the power of volition, and compare the incongruous idea with\r\nour previous knowledge of nature, and reject it. This operation of the mind\r\nhas not yet acquired a specific name, though it is exerted every minute of\r\nour waking hours; unless it may be termed INTUITIVE ANALOGY. It is an act\r\nof reasoning of which we are unconscious except from its effects in\r\npreserving the congruity of our ideas, and bears the same relation to the\r\nsensorial power of volition, that irritative ideas, of which we are\r\ninconscious except by their effects, do to the sensorial power of\r\nirritation; as the former is produced by volition without our attention to\r\nit, and the latter by irritation without our attention to them.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand a train of imagination or of voluntary ideas are\r\nexcited with great energy, and passing on with great vivacity, and become\r\ndissevered by some violent stimulus, as the discharge of a pistol near\r\none's ear, another circumstance takes place, which is termed SURPRISE;\r\nwhich by exciting violent irritation, and violent sensation, employs for a\r\ntime the whole sensorial energy, and thus dissevers the passing trains of\r\nideas, before the power of volition has time to compare them with the usual\r\nphenomena of nature. In this case fear is generally the companion of\r\nsurprise, and adds to our embarrassment, as every one experiences in some\r\ndegree when he hears a noise in the dark, which he cannot instantly account\r\nfor. This catenation of fear with surprise is owing to our perpetual\r\nexperience of injuries from external bodies in motion, unless we are upon\r\nour guard against them. See Sect. XVIII. 17. XIX. 2.\r\n\r\nMany other examples of the catenations of animal motions are explained in\r\nSect. XXXVI. on the Periods of Diseases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

There are four situations of our system, which in their moderate degrees\r\nare not usually termed diseases, and yet abound with many very curious and\r\ninstructive phenomena; these are sleep, reverie, vertigo, drunkenness.\r\nThese we shall previously consider, before we step forwards to develop the\r\ncauses and cures of diseases with the modes of the operation of medicines.\r\n\r\nAs all those trains and tribes of animal motion, which are subjected to\r\nvolition, were the last that were caused, their connection is weaker than\r\nthat of the other classes; and there is a peculiar circumstance attending\r\nthis causation, which is, that it is entirely suspended during sleep;\r\nwhilst the other classes of motion, which are more immediately necessary to\r\nlife, as those caused by internal stimuli, for instance the pulsations of\r\nthe heart and arteries, or those catenated with pleasurable sensation, as\r\nthe powers of digestion, continue to strengthen their habits without\r\ninterruption. Thus though man in his sleeping state is a much less perfect\r\nanimal, than in his waking hours; and though he consumes more than one\r\nthird of his life in this his irrational situation; yet is the wisdom of\r\nthe Author of nature manifest even in this seeming imperfection of his\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nThe truth of this assertion with respect to the large muscles of the body,\r\nwhich are concerned in locomotion, is evident; as no one in perfect sanity\r\nwalks about in his sleep, or performs any domestic offices: and in respect\r\nto the mind, we never exercise our reason or recollection in dreams; we may\r\nsometimes seem distracted between contending passions, but we never compare\r\ntheir objects, or deliberate about the acquisition of those objects, if our\r\nsleep is perfect. And though many synchronous tribes or successive trains\r\nof ideas may represent the houses or walks, which have real existence, yet\r\nare they here introduced by their connection with our sensations, and are\r\nin truth ideas of imagination, not of recollection.\r\n\r\n2. For our sensations of pleasure and pain are experienced with great\r\nvivacity in our dreams; and hence all that motley group of ideas, which are\r\ncaused by them, called the ideas of imagination, with their various\r\nassociated trains, are in a very vivid manner acted over in the sensorium;\r\nand these sometimes call into action the larger muscles, which have been\r\nmuch associated with them; as appears from the muttering sentences, which\r\nsome people utter in their dreams, and from the obscure barking of sleeping\r\ndogs, and the motions of their feet and nostrils.\r\n\r\nThis perpetual flow of the trains of ideas, which constitute our dreams,\r\nand which are caused by painful or pleasurable sensation, might at first\r\nview be conceived to be an useless expenditure of sensorial power. But it\r\nhas been shewn, that those motions, which are perpetually excited, as those\r\nof the arterial system by the stimulus of the blood, are attended by a\r\ngreat accumulation of sensorial power, after they have been for a time\r\nsuspended; as the hot-fit of fever is the consequence of the cold one. Now\r\nas these trains of ideas caused by sensation are perpetually excited during\r\nour waking hours, if they were to be suspended in sleep like the voluntary\r\nmotions, (which are exerted only by intervals during our waking hours,) an\r\naccumulation of sensorial power would follow; and on our awaking a delirium\r\nwould supervene, since these ideas caused by sensation would be produced\r\nwith such energy, that we should mistake the trains of imagination for\r\nideas excited by irritation; as perpetually happens to people debilitated\r\nby fevers on their first awaking; for in these fevers with debility the\r\ngeneral quantity of irritation being diminished, that of sensation is\r\nincreased. In like manner if the actions of the stomach, intestines, and\r\nvarious glands, which are perhaps in part at least caused by or catenated\r\nwith agreeable sensation, and which perpetually exist during our waking\r\nhours, were like the voluntary motions suspended in our sleep; the great\r\naccumulation of sensorial power, which would necessarily follow, would be\r\nliable to excite inflammation in them.\r\n\r\n3. When by our continued posture in sleep, some uneasy sensations are\r\nproduced, we either gradually awake by the exertion of volition, or the\r\nmuscles connected by habit with such sensations alter the position of the\r\nbody; but where the sleep is uncommonly profound, and those uneasy\r\nsensations great, the disease called the incubus, or nightmare, is\r\nproduced. Here the desire of moving the body is painfully exerted, by the\r\npower of moving it, or volition, is incapable of action, till we awake.\r\nMany less disagreeable struggles in our dreams, as when we wish in vain to\r\nfly from terrifying objects, constitute a slighter degree of this disease.\r\nIn awaking from the nightmare I have more than once observed, that there\r\nwas no disorder in my pulse; nor do I believe the respiration is laborious,\r\nas some have affirmed. It occurs to people whose sleep is too profound, and\r\nsome disagreeable sensation exists, which at other times would have\r\nawakened them, and have thence prevented the disease of nightmare; as after\r\ngreat fatigue or hunger with too large a supper and wine, which occasion\r\nour sleep to be uncommonly profound. See No. 14, of this Section.\r\n\r\n4. As the larger muscles of the body are much more frequently excited by\r\nvolition than by sensation, they are but seldom brought into action in our\r\nsleep: but the ideas of the mind are by habit much more frequently\r\nconnected with sensation than with volition; and hence the ceaseless flow\r\nof our ideas in dreams. Every one's experience will teach him this truth,\r\nfor we all daily exert much voluntary muscular motion: but few of mankind\r\ncan bear the fatigue of much voluntary thinking.\r\n\r\n5. A very curious circumstance attending these our sleeping imaginations\r\nis, that we seem to receive them by the senses. The muscles, which are\r\nsubservient to the external organs of sense, are connected with volition,\r\nand cease to act in sleep; hence the eyelids are closed, and the tympanum\r\nof the ear relaxed; and it is probable a similarity of voluntary exertion\r\nmay be necessary for the perceptions of the other nerves of sense; for it\r\nis observed that the papillæ of the tongue can be seen to become erected,\r\nwhen we attempt to taste any thing extremely grateful. Hewson Exper.\r\nEnquir. V. 2. 186. Albini Annot. Acad. L. i. c. 15. Add to this, that the\r\nimmediate organs of sense have no objects to excite them in the darkness\r\nand silence of the night, but their nerves of sense nevertheless continue\r\nto possess their perfect activity subservient to all their numerous\r\nsensitive connections. This vivacity of our nerves of sense during the time\r\nof sleep is evinced by a circumstance, which almost every one must at some\r\ntime or other have experienced; that is, if we sleep in the daylight, and\r\nendeavour to see some object in our dream, the light is exceedingly painful\r\nto our eyes; and after repeated struggles we lament in our sleep, that we\r\ncannot see it. In this case I apprehend the eyelid is in some degree opened\r\nby the vehemence of our sensations; and, the iris being dilated, the optic\r\nnerve shews as great or greater sensibility than in our waking hours. See\r\nNo. 15. of this Section.\r\n\r\nWhen we are forcibly waked at midnight from profound sleep, our eyes are\r\nmuch dazzled with the light of the candle for a minute or two, after there\r\nhas been sufficient time allowed for the contraction of the iris; which is\r\nowing to the accumulation of sensorial power in the organ of vision during\r\nits state of less activity. But when we have dreamt much of visible\r\nobjects, this accumulation of sensorial power in the organ of vision is\r\nlessened or prevented, and we awake in the morning without being dazzled\r\nwith the light, after the iris has had time to contract itself. This is a\r\nmatter of great curiosity, and may be thus tried by any one in the\r\nday-light. Close your eyes, and cover them with your hat; think for a\r\nminute on a tune, which you are accustomed to, and endeavour to sing it\r\nwith as little activity of mind as possible. Suddenly uncover and open your\r\neyes, and in one second of time the iris will contract itself, but you will\r\nperceive the day more luminous for several seconds, owing to the\r\naccumulation of sensorial power in the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nThen again close and cover your eyes, and think intensely on a cube of\r\nivory two inches diameter, attending first to the north and south sides of\r\nit, and then to the other four sides of it; then get a clear image in your\r\nmind's eye of all the sides of the same cube coloured red; and then of it\r\ncoloured green; and then of it coloured blue; lastly, open your eyes as in\r\nthe former experiment, and after the first second of time allowed for the\r\ncontraction of the iris, you will not perceive any increase of the light of\r\nthe day, or dazzling; because now there is no accumulation of sensorial\r\npower in the optic nerve; that having been expended by its action in\r\nthinking over visible objects.\r\n\r\nThis experiment is not easy to be made at first, but by a few patient\r\ntrials the fact appears very certain; and shews clearly, that our ideas of\r\nimagination are repetitions of the motions of the nerve, which were\r\noriginally occasioned by the stimulus of external bodies; because they\r\nequally expend the sensorial power in the organ of sense. See Sect. III. 4.\r\nwhich is analogous to our being as much fatigued by thinking as by labour.\r\n\r\n6. Nor is it in our dreams alone, but even in our waking reveries, and in\r\ngreat efforts of invention, so great is the vivacity of our ideas, that we\r\ndo not for a time distinguish them from the real presence of substantial\r\nobjects; though the external organs of sense are open, and surrounded with\r\ntheir usual stimuli. Thus whilst I am thinking over the beautiful valley,\r\nthrough which I yesterday travelled, I do not perceive the furniture of my\r\nroom: and there are some, whose waking imaginations are so apt to run into\r\nperfect reverie, that in their common attention to a favourite idea they do\r\nnot hear the voice of the companion, who accosts them, unless it is\r\nrepeated with unusual energy.\r\n\r\nThis perpetual mistake in dreams and reveries, where our ideas of\r\nimagination are attended with a belief of the presence of external objects,\r\nevinces beyond a doubt, that all our ideas are repetitions of the motions\r\nof the nerves of sense, by which they were acquired; and that this belief\r\nis not, as some late philosophers contend, an instinct necessarily\r\nconnected only with our perceptions.\r\n\r\n7. A curious question demands our attention in this place; as we do not\r\ndistinguish in our dreams and reveries between our perceptions of external\r\nobjects, and our ideas of them in their absence, how do we distinguish them\r\nat any time? In a dream, if the sweetness of sugar occurs to my\r\nimagination, the whiteness and hardness of it, which were ideas usually\r\nconnected with the sweetness, immediately follow in the train; and I\r\nbelieve a material lump of sugar present before my senses: but in my waking\r\nhours, if the sweetness occurs to my imagination, the stimulus of the table\r\nto my hand, or of the window to my eye, prevents the other ideas of the\r\nhardness and whiteness of the sugar from succeeding; and hence I perceive\r\nthe fallacy, and disbelieve the existence of objects correspondent to those\r\nideas, whose tribes or trains are broken by the stimulus of other objects.\r\nAnd further in our waking hours, we frequently exert our volition in\r\ncomparing present appearances with such, as we have usually observed; and\r\nthus correct the errors of one sense by our general knowledge of nature by\r\nintuitive analogy. See Sect. XVII. 3. 7. Whereas in dreams the power of\r\nvolition is suspended, we can recollect and compare our present ideas with\r\nnone of our acquired knowledge, and are hence incapable of observing any\r\nabsurdities in them.\r\n\r\nBy this criterion we distinguish our waking from our sleeping hours, we can\r\nvoluntarily recollect our sleeping ideas, when we are awake, and compare\r\nthem with our waking ones; but we cannot in our sleep _voluntarily_\r\nrecollect our waking ideas at all.\r\n\r\n8. The vast variety of scenery, novelty of combination, and distinctness of\r\nimagery, are other curious circumstances of our sleeping imaginations. The\r\nvariety of scenery seems to arise from the superior activity and excellence\r\nof our sense of vision; which in an instant unfolds to the mind extensive\r\nfields of pleasurable ideas; while the other senses collect their objects\r\nslowly, and with little combination; add to this, that the ideas, which\r\nthis organ presents us with, are more frequently connected with our\r\nsensation than those of any other.\r\n\r\n9. The great novelty of combination is owing to another circumstance; the\r\ntrains of ideas, which are carried on in our waking thoughts, are in our\r\ndreams dissevered in a thousand places by the suspension of volition, and\r\nthe absence of irritative ideas, and are hence perpetually falling into new\r\ncatenations. As explained in Sect. XVII. 1. 9. For the power of volition is\r\nperpetually exerted during our waking hours in comparing our passing trains\r\nof ideas with our acquired knowledge of nature, and thus forms many\r\nintermediate links in their catenation. And the irritative ideas excited by\r\nthe stimulus of the objects, with which we are surrounded, are every moment\r\nintruded upon us, and form other links of our unceasing catenations of\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n10. The absence of the stimuli of external bodies, and of volition, in our\r\ndreams renders the organs of sense liable to be more strongly affected by\r\nthe powers of sensation, and of association. For our desires or aversions,\r\nor the obtrusions of surrounding bodies, dissever the sensitive and\r\nassociate tribes of ideas in our waking hours by introducing those of\r\nirritation and volition amongst them. Hence proceeds the superior\r\ndistinctness of pleasurable or painful imagery in our sleep; for we recal\r\nthe figure and the features of a long lost friend, whom we loved, in our\r\ndreams with much more accuracy and vivacity than in our waking thoughts.\r\nThis circumstance contributes to prove, that our ideas of imagination are\r\nreiterations of those motions of our organs of sense, which were excited by\r\nexternal objects; because while we are exposed to the stimuli of present\r\nobjects, our ideas of absent objects cannot be so distinctly formed.\r\n\r\n11. The rapidity of the succession of transactions in our dreams is almost\r\ninconceivable; insomuch that, when we are accidentally awakened by the\r\njarring of a door, which is opened into our bed-chamber, we sometimes dream\r\na whole history of thieves or fire in the very instant of awaking.\r\n\r\nDuring the suspension of volition we cannot compare our other ideas with\r\nthose of the parts of time in which they exist; that is, we cannot compare\r\nthe imaginary scene, which is before us, with those changes of it, which\r\nprecede or follow it: because this act of comparing requires recollection\r\nor voluntary exertion. Whereas in our waking hours, we are perpetually\r\nmaking this comparison, and by that means our waking ideas are kept\r\nconfident with each other by intuitive analogy; but this companion retards\r\nthe succession of them, by occasioning their repetition. Add to this, that\r\nthe transactions of our dreams consist chiefly of visible ideas, and that a\r\nwhole history of thieves and fire may be _beheld_ in an instant of time\r\nlike the figures in a picture.\r\n\r\n12. From this incapacity of attending to the parts of time in our dreams,\r\narises our ignorance of the length of the night; which, but from our\r\nconstant experience to the contrary, we should conclude was but a few\r\nminutes, when our sleep is perfect. The same happens in our reveries; thus\r\nwhen we are possessed with vehement joy, grief, or anger, time appears\r\nshort, for we exert no volition to compare the present scenery with the\r\npast or future; but when we are compelled to perform those exercises of\r\nmind or body, which, are unmixed with passion, as in travelling over a\r\ndreary country, time appears long; for our desire to finish our journey\r\noccasions us more frequently to compare our present situation with the\r\nparts of time or place, which are before and behind us.\r\n\r\nSo when we are enveloped in deep contemplation of any kind, or in reverie,\r\nas in reading a very interesting play or romance, we measure time very\r\ninaccurately; and hence, if a play greatly affects our passions, the\r\nabsurdities of passing over many days or years, and or perpetual changes of\r\nplace, are not perceived by the audience; as is experienced by every one,\r\nwho reads or sees some plays of the immortal Shakespear; but it is\r\nnecessary for inferior authors to observe those rules of the [Greek:\r\npithanon] and [Greek: prepon] inculcated by Aristotle, because their works\r\ndo not interest the passions sufficiently to produce complete reverie.\r\n\r\nThose works, however, whether a romance or a sermon, which do not interest\r\nus so much as to induce reverie, may nevertheless incline us to sleep. For\r\nthose pleasurable ideas, which are presented to us, and are too gentle to\r\nexcite laughter, (which is attended with interrupted voluntary exertions,\r\nas explained Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.) and which are not accompanied with any\r\nother emotion, which usually excites some voluntary exertion, as anger, or\r\nfear, are liable to produce sleep; which consists in a suspension of all\r\nvoluntary power. But if the ideas thus presented to us, and interest our\r\nattention, are accompanied with so much pleasurable or painful sensation as\r\nto excite our voluntary exertion at the same time, reverie is the\r\nconsequence. Hence an interesting play produces reverie, a tedious one\r\nproduces sleep: in the latter we become exhausted by attention, and are not\r\nexcited to any voluntary exertion, and therefore sleep; in the former we\r\nare excited by some emotion, which prevents by its pain the suspension of\r\nvolition, and in as much as it interests us, induces reverie, as explained\r\nin the next Section.\r\n\r\nBut when our sleep is imperfect, as when we have determined to rise in half\r\nan hour, time appears longer to us than in most other situations. Here our\r\nsolicitude not to oversleep the determined time induces us in this\r\nimperfect sleep to compare the quick changes of imagined scenery with the\r\nparts of time or place, they would have taken up, had they real exigence;\r\nand that more frequently than in our waking hours; and hence the time\r\nappears longer to us: and I make no doubt, but the permitted time appears\r\nlong to a man going to the gallows, as the fear of its quick lapse will\r\nmake him think frequently about it.\r\n\r\n13. As we gain our knowledge of time by comparing the present scenery with\r\nthe past and future, and of place by comparing the situations of objects\r\nwith each other; so we gain our idea of consciousness by comparing\r\nourselves with the scenery around us; and of identity by comparing our\r\npresent consciousness with our past consciousness: as we never think of\r\ntime or place, but when we make the companions above mentioned, so we never\r\nthink of consciousness, but when we compare our own existence with that of\r\nother objects; nor of identity, but when we compare our present and our\r\npast consciousness. Hence the consciousness of our own existence, and of\r\nour identity, is owing to a voluntary exertion of our minds: and on that\r\naccount in our complete dreams we neither measure time, are surprised at\r\nthe sudden changes of place, nor attend to our own existence, or identity;\r\nbecause our power of volition is suspended. But all these circumstances are\r\nmore or less observable in our incomplete ones; for then we attend a little\r\nto the lapse of time, and the changes of place, and to our own existence;\r\nand even to our identity of person; for a lady seldom dreams, that she is a\r\nsoldier; nor a man, that he is brought to bed.\r\n\r\n14. As long as our sensations only excite their sensual motions, or ideas,\r\nour sleep continues sound; but as soon as they excite desires or aversions,\r\nour sleep becomes imperfect; and when that desire or aversion is so strong,\r\nas to produce voluntary motions, we begin to awake; the larger muscles of\r\nthe body are brought into action to remove that irritation or sensation,\r\nwhich a continued posture has caused; we stretch our limbs, and yawn, and\r\nour sleep is thus broken by the accumulation of voluntary power.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens, that the act of waking is suddenly produced, and this\r\nsoon after the commencement of sleep; which is occasioned by some sensation\r\nso disagreeable, as instantaneously to excite the power of volition; and a\r\ntemporary action of all the voluntary motions suddenly succeeds, and we\r\nstart awake. This is sometimes accompanied with loud noise in the ears, and\r\nwith some degree of fear; and when it is in great excess, so as to produce\r\ncontinued convulsive motions of those muscles, which are generally\r\nsubservient to volition, it becomes epilepsy: the fits of which in some\r\npatients generally commence during sleep. This differs from the night-mare\r\ndescribed in No. 3. of this Section, because in that the disagreeable\r\nsensation is not so great as to excite the power of volition into action;\r\nfor as soon as that happens, the disease ceases.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance, which sometimes awakes people soon after the\r\ncommencement of their sleep, is where the voluntary power is already so\r\ngreat in quantity as almost to prevent them from falling asleep, and then a\r\nlittle accumulation of it soon again awakens them; this happens in cases of\r\ninsanity, or where the mind has been lately much agitated by fear or anger.\r\nThere is another circumstance in which sleep is likewise of short duration,\r\nwhich arises from great debility, as after great over-fatigue, and in some\r\nfevers, where the strength of the patient is greatly diminished, as in\r\nthese cases the pulse intermits or flutters, and the respiration is\r\npreviously affected, it seems to originate from the want of some voluntary\r\nefforts to facilitate respiration, as when we are awake. And is further\r\ntreated of in Vol. II. Class I. 2. 1. 2. on the Diseases of the Voluntary\r\nPower. Art. Somnus interruptus.\r\n\r\n15. We come now to those motions which depend on irritation. The motions of\r\nthe arterial and glandular systems continue in our sleep, proceeding slower\r\nindeed, but stronger and more uniformly, than in our waking hours, when\r\nthey are incommoded by external stimuli, or by the movements of volition;\r\nthe motions of the muscles subservient to respiration continue to be\r\nstimulated into action, and the other internal senses of hunger, thirst,\r\nand lust, are not only occasionally excited in our sleep, but their\r\nirritative motions are succeeded by their usual sensations, and make a part\r\nof the farrago of our dreams. These sensations of the want of air, of\r\nhunger, thirst, and lust, in our dreams, contribute to prove, that the\r\nnerves of the external senses are also alive and excitable in our sleep;\r\nbut as the stimuli of external objects are either excluded from them by the\r\ndarkness and silence of the night, or their access to them is prevented by\r\nthe suspension of volition, these nerves of sense fall more readily into\r\ntheir connexions with sensation and with association; because much\r\nsensorial power, which during the day was expended in moving the external\r\norgans of sense in consequence of irritation from external stimuli, or in\r\nconsequence of volition, becomes now in some degree accumulated, and\r\nrenders the internal or immediate organs of sense more easily excitable by\r\nthe other sensorial powers. Thus in respect to the eye, the irritation from\r\nexternal stimuli, and the power of volition during our waking hours,\r\nelevate the eye-lids, adapt the aperture of the iris to the quantity of\r\nlight, the focus of the crystalline humour, and the angle of the optic\r\naxises to the distance of the object, all which perpetual activity during\r\nthe day expends much sensorial power, which is saved during our sleep.\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that not only those parts of the system, which are always\r\nexcited by internal stimuli, as the stomach, intestinal canal, bile-ducts,\r\nand the various glands, but the organs of sense also may be more violently\r\nexcited into action by the irritation from internal stimuli, or by\r\nsensation, during our sleep than in our waking hours; because during the\r\nsuspension of volition, there is a greater quantity of the spirit of\r\nanimation to be expended by the other sensorial powers. On this account our\r\nirritability to internal stimuli, and our sensibility to pain or pleasure,\r\nis not only greater in sleep, but increases as our sleep is prolonged.\r\nWhence digestion and secretion are performed better in sleep, than in our\r\nwaking hours, and our dreams in the morning have greater variety and\r\nvivacity, as our sensibility increases, than at night when we first lie\r\ndown. And hence epileptic fits, which are always occasioned by some\r\ndisagreeable sensation, so frequently attack those, who are subject to\r\nthem, in their sleep; because at this time the system is more excitable by\r\npainful sensation in consequence of internal stimuli; and the power of\r\nvolition is then suddenly exerted to relieve this pain, as explained Sect.\r\nXXXIV. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nThere is a disease, which frequently affects children in the cradle, which\r\nis termed ecstasy, and seems to consist in certain exertions to relieve\r\npainful sensation, in which the voluntary power is not so far excited as\r\ntotally to awaken them, and yet is sufficient to remove the disagreeable\r\nsensation, which excites it; in this case changing the posture of the child\r\nfrequently relieves it.\r\n\r\nI have at this time under my care an elegant young man about twenty-two\r\nyears of age, who seldom sleeps more than an hour without experiencing a\r\nconvulsion fit; which ceases in about half a minute without any subsequent\r\nstupor. Large doses of opium only prevented the paroxysms, so long as they\r\nprevented him from sleeping by the intoxication, which they induced. Other\r\nmedicines had no effect on him. He was gently awakened every half hour for\r\none night, but without good effect, as he soon slept again, and the fit\r\nreturned at about the same periods of time, for the accumulated sensorial\r\npower, which occasioned the increased sensibility to pain, was not thus\r\nexhausted. This case evinces, that the sensibility of the system to\r\ninternal excitation increases, as our sleep is prolonged; till the pain\r\nthus occasioned produces voluntary exertion; which, when it is in its usual\r\ndegree, only awakens us; but when it is more violent, it occasions\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nThe cramp in the calf of the leg is another kind of convulsion, which\r\ngenerally commences in sleep, occasioned by the continual increase of\r\nirritability from internal stimuli, or of sensibility, during that state of\r\nour existence. The cramp is a violent exertion to relieve pain, generally\r\neither of the skin from cold, or of the bowels, as in some diarrhoeas, or\r\nfrom the muscles having been previously overstretched, as in walking up or\r\ndown steep hills. But in these convulsions of the muscles, which form the\r\ncalf of the leg, the contraction is so violent as to occasion another pain\r\nin consequence of their own too violent contraction; as soon as the\r\noriginal pain, which caused the contraction, is removed. And hence the\r\ncramp, or spasm, of these muscles is continued without intermission by this\r\nnew pain, unlike the alternate convulsions and remissions in epileptic\r\nfits. The reason, that the contraction of these muscles of the calf of the\r\nleg is more violent during their convulsion than that of others, depends on\r\nthe weakness of their antagonist muscles; for after these have been\r\ncontracted in their usual action, as at every step in walking, they are\r\nagain extended, not, as most other muscles are, by their antagonists, but\r\nby the weight of the whole body on the balls of the toes; and that weight\r\napplied to great mechanical advantage on the heel, that is, on the other\r\nend of the bone of the foot, which thus acts as a lever.\r\n\r\nAnother disease, the periods of which generally commence during our sleep,\r\nis the asthma. Whatever may be the remote cause of paroxysms of asthma, the\r\nimmediate cause of the convulsive respiration, whether in the common\r\nasthma, or in what is termed the convulsive asthma, which are perhaps only\r\ndifferent degrees of the same disease, must be owing to violent voluntary\r\nexertions to relieve pain, as in other convulsions; and the increase of\r\nirritability to internal stimuli, or of sensibility, during sleep must\r\noccasion them to commence at this time.\r\n\r\nDebilitated people, who have been unfortunately accustomed to great\r\ningurgitation of spirituous potation, frequently part with a great quantity\r\nof water during the night, but with not more than usual in the day-time.\r\nThis is owing to a beginning torpor of the absorbent system, and precedes\r\nanasarca, which commences in the day, but is cured in the night by the\r\nincrease of the irritability of the absorbent system during sleep, which\r\nthus imbibes from the cellular membrane the fluids, which had been\r\naccumulated there during the day; though it is possible the horizontal\r\nposition of the body may contribute something to this purpose, and also the\r\ngreater irritability of some branches of the absorbent vessels, which open\r\ntheir mouths in the cells of the cellular membrane, than that of other\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a person begins to sleep, the irritability and sensibility of\r\nthe system begins to increase, owing to the suspension of volition and the\r\nexclusion of external stimuli. Hence the actions of the vessels in\r\nobedience to internal stimulation become stronger and more energetic,\r\nthough less frequent in respect to number. And as many of the secretions\r\nare increased, so the heat of the system is gradually increased, and the\r\nextremities of feeble people, which had been cold during the day, become\r\nwarm. Till towards morning many people become so warm, as to find it\r\nnecessary to throw off some of their bed-clothes, as soon as they awake;\r\nand in others sweats are so liable to occur towards morning during their\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThus those, who are not accustomed to sleep in the open air, are very\r\nliable to take cold, if they happen to fall asleep on a garden bench, or in\r\na carriage with the window open. For as the system is warmer during sleep,\r\nas above explained, if a current of cold air affects any part of the body,\r\na torpor of that part is more effectually produced, as when a cold blast of\r\nair through a key-hole or casement falls upon a person in a warm room. In\r\nthose cases the affected part possesses less irritability in respect to\r\nheat, from its having previously been exposed to a greater stimulus of\r\nheat, as in the warm room, or during sleep; and hence, when the stimulus of\r\nheat is diminished, a torpor is liable to ensue; that is, we take cold.\r\nHence people who sleep in the open air, generally feel chilly both at the\r\napproach of sleep, and on their awaking; and hence many people are\r\nperpetually subject to catarrhs if they sleep in a less warm head-dress,\r\nthan that which they wear in the day.\r\n\r\n16. Not only the sensorial powers of irritation and of sensation, but that\r\nof association also appear to act with greater vigour during the suspension\r\nof volition in sleep. It will be shewn in another place, that the gout\r\ngenerally first attacks the liver, and that afterwards an inflammation of\r\nthe ball of the great toe commences by association, and that of the liver\r\nceases. Now as this change or metastasis of the activity of the system\r\ngenerally commences in sleep, it follows, that these associations of motion\r\nexist with greater energy at that time; that is, that the sensorial faculty\r\nof association, like those of irritation and of sensation, becomes in some\r\nmeasure accumulated during the suspension of volition.\r\n\r\nOther associate tribes and trains of motions, as well as the irritative and\r\nsensitive ones, appear to be increased in their activity during the\r\nsuspension of volition in sleep. As those which contribute to circulate the\r\nblood, and to perform the various secretions; as well as the associate\r\ntribes and trains of ideas, which contribute to furnish the perpetual\r\ndreams of our dreaming imaginations.\r\n\r\nIn sleep the secretions have generally been supposed to be diminished, as\r\nthe expectorated mucus in coughs, the fluids discharged in diarrhoeas, and\r\nin salivation, except indeed the secretion of sweat, which is often visibly\r\nincreased. This error seems to have arisen from attention to the excretions\r\nrather than to the secretions. For the secretions, except that of sweat,\r\nare generally received into reservoirs, as the urine into the bladder, and\r\nthe mucus of the intestines and lungs into their respective cavities; but\r\nthese reservoirs do not exclude these fluids immediately by their stimulus,\r\nbut require at the same time some voluntary efforts, and therefore permit\r\nthem to remain during sleep. And as they thus continue longer in those\r\nreceptacles in our sleeping hours, a greater part is absorbed from them,\r\nand the remainder becomes thicker, and sometimes in less quantity, though\r\nat the time it was secreted the fluid was in greater quantity than in our\r\nwaking hours. Thus the urine is higher coloured after long sleep; which\r\nshews that a greater quantity has been secreted, and that more of the\r\naqueous and saline part has been reabsorbed, and the earthy part left in\r\nthe bladder; hence thick urine in fevers shews only a greater action of the\r\nvessels which secrete it in the kidneys, and of those which absorb it from\r\nthe bladder.\r\n\r\nThe same happens to the mucus expectorated in coughs, which is thus\r\nthickened by absorption of its aqueous and saline parts; and the same of\r\nthe feces of the intestines. From hence it appears, and from what has been\r\nsaid in No. 15. of this Section concerning the increase of irritability and\r\nof sensibility during sleep, that the secretions are in general rather\r\nincreased than diminished during these hours of our existence; and it is\r\nprobable that nutrition is almost entirely performed in sleep; and that\r\nyoung animals grow more at this time than in their waking hours, as young\r\nplants have long since been observed to grow more in the night, which is\r\ntheir time of sleep.\r\n\r\n17. Two other remarkable circumstances of our dreaming ideas are their\r\ninconsistency, and the total absence of surprise. Thus we seem to be\r\npresent at more extraordinary metamorphoses of animals or trees, than are\r\nto be met with in the fables of antiquity; and appear to be transported\r\nfrom place to place, which seas divide, as quickly as the changes of\r\nscenery are performed in a play-house; and yet are not sensible of their\r\ninconsistency, nor in the least degree affected with surprise.\r\n\r\nWe must consider this circumstance more minutely. In our waking trains of\r\nideas, those that are inconsistent with the usual order of nature, so\r\nrarely have occurred to us, that their connexion is the slightest of all\r\nothers: hence, when a consistent train of ideas is exhausted, we attend to\r\nthe external stimuli, that usually surround us, rather than to any\r\ninconsistent idea, which might otherwise present itself; and if an\r\ninconsistent idea should intrude itself, we immediately compare it with the\r\npreceding one, and voluntarily reject the train it would introduce; this\r\nappears further in the Section on Reverie, in which state of the mind\r\nexternal stimuli are not attended to, and yet the streams of ideas are kept\r\nconsistent by the efforts of volition. But as our faculty of volition is\r\nsuspended, and all external stimuli are excluded in sleep, this slighter\r\nconnexion of ideas takes place; and the train is said to be inconsistent;\r\nthat is, dissimilar to the usual order of nature.\r\n\r\nBut, when any consistent train of sensitive or voluntary ideas is flowing\r\nalong, if any external stimulus affects us so violently, as to intrude\r\nirritative ideas forcibly into the mind, it disunites the former train of\r\nideas, and we are affected with surprise. These stimuli of unusual energy\r\nor novelty not only disunite our common trains of ideas, but the trains of\r\nmuscular motions also, which have not been long established by habit, and\r\ndisturb those that have. Some people become motionless by great surprise,\r\nthe fits of hiccup and or ague have been often removed by it, and it even\r\naffects the movements of the heart, and arteries; but in our sleep, all\r\nexternal stimuli are excluded, and in consequence no surprise can exist.\r\nSee Section XVII. 3. 7.\r\n\r\n18. We frequently awake with pleasure from a dream, which has delighted us,\r\nwithout being able to recollect the transactions of it; unless perhaps at a\r\ndistance of time, some analogous idea may introduce afresh this forgotten\r\ntrain: and in our waking reveries we sometimes in a moment lose the train\r\nof thought, but continue to feel the glow of pleasure, or the depression of\r\nspirits, it occasioned: whilst at other times we can retrace with ease\r\nthese histories of our reveries and dreams.\r\n\r\nThe above explanation of surprise throws light upon this subject. When we\r\nare suddenly awaked by any violent stimulus, the surprise totally disunites\r\nthe trains of our sleeping ideas from these of our waking ones; but if we\r\ngradually awake, this does not happen; and we readily unravel the preceding\r\ntrains of imagination.\r\n\r\n19. There are various degrees of surprise; the more intent we are upon the\r\ntrain of ideas, which we are employed about, the more violent must be the\r\nstimulus that interrupts them, and the greater is the degree of surprise. I\r\nhave observed dogs, who have slept by the fire, and by their obscure\r\nbarking and struggling have appeared very intent on their prey, that shewed\r\ngreat surprise for a few seconds after their awaking by looking eagerly\r\naround them; which they did not do at other times of waking. And an\r\nintelligent friend of mine has remarked, that his lady, who frequently\r\nspeaks much and articulately in her sleep, could never recollect her dreams\r\nin the morning, when this happened to her: but that when she did not speak\r\nin her sleep, she could always recollect them.\r\n\r\nHence, when our sensations act so strongly in sleep as to influence the\r\nlarger muscles, as in those, who talk or struggle in their dreams; or in\r\nthose, who are affected with complete reverie (as described in the next\r\nSection), great surprise is produced, when they awake; and these as well as\r\nthose, who are completely drunk or delirious, totally forget afterwards\r\ntheir imaginations at those times.\r\n\r\n20. As the immediate cause of sleep consists in the suspension of volition,\r\nit follows, that whatever diminishes the general quantity of sensorial\r\npower, or derives it from the faculty of volition, will constitute a remote\r\ncause of sleep; such as fatigue from muscular or mental exertion, which\r\ndiminishes the general quantity of sensorial power; or an increase of the\r\nsensitive motions, as by attending to soft music, which diverts the\r\nsensorial power from the faculty of volition; or lastly, by increase of the\r\nirritative motions, as by wine, or food; or warmth; which not only by their\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power diminish the quantity of volition; but also\r\nby their producing pleasureable sensations (which occasion other muscular\r\nor sensual motions in consequence), doubly decrease the voluntary power,\r\nand thus more forcibly produce sleep. See Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nAnother method of inducing sleep is delivered in a very ingenious work\r\nlately published by Dr. Beddoes. Who, after lamenting that opium frequently\r\noccasions restlessness, thinks, \"that in most cases it would be better to\r\ninduce sleep by the abstraction of stimuli, than by exhausting the\r\nexcitability;\" and adds, \"upon this principle we could not have a better\r\nsoporific than an atmosphere with a diminished proportion of oxygene air,\r\nand that common air might be admitted after the patient was asleep.\"\r\n(Observ. on Calculus, &c. by Dr. Beddoes, Murray.) If it should be found to\r\nbe true, that the excitability of the system depends on the quantity of\r\noxygene absorbed by the lungs in respiration according to the theory of Dr.\r\nBeddoes, and of M. Girtanner, this idea of sleeping in an atmosphere with\r\nless oxygene in its composition might be of great service in epileptic\r\ncases, and in cramp, and even in fits of the asthma, where their periods\r\ncommence from the increase of irritability during sleep.\r\n\r\nSleep is likewise said to be induced by mechanic pressure on the brain in\r\nthe cases of spina bifida. Where there has been a defect of one of the\r\nvertebræ of the back, a tumour is protruded in consequence; and, whenever\r\nthis tumour has been compressed by the hand, sleep is said to be induced,\r\nbecause the whole of the brain both within the head and spine becomes\r\ncompressed by the retrocession of the fluid within the tumour. But by what\r\nmeans a compression of the brain induces sleep has not been explained, but\r\nprobably by diminishing the secretion of sensorial power, and then the\r\nvoluntary motions become suspended previously to the irritative ones, as\r\noccurs in most dying persons.\r\n\r\nAnother way of procuring sleep mechanically was related to me by Mr.\r\nBrindley, the famous canal engineer, who was brought up to the business of\r\na mill-wright; he told me, that he had more than once seen the experiment\r\nof a man extending himself across the large stone of a corn-mill, and that\r\nby gradually letting the stone whirl, the man fell asleep, before the stone\r\nhad gained its full velocity, and he supposed would have died without pain\r\nby the continuance or increase of the motion. In this case the centrifugal\r\nmotion of the head and feet must accumulate the blood in both those\r\nextremities of the body, and thus compress the brain.\r\n\r\nLastly, we should mention the application of cold; which, when in a less\r\ndegree, produces watchfulness by the pain it occasions, and the tremulous\r\nconvulsions of the subcutaneous muscles; but when it is applied in great\r\ndegree, is said to produce sleep. To explain this effect it has been said,\r\nthat as the vessels of the skin and extremities become first torpid by the\r\nwant of the stimulus of heat, and as thence less blood is circulated\r\nthrough them, as appears from their paleness, a greater quantity of blood\r\npoured upon the brain produces sleep by its compression of that organ. But\r\nI should rather imagine, that the sensorial power becomes exhausted by the\r\nconvulsive actions in consequence of the pain of cold, and of the voluntary\r\nexercise previously used to prevent it, and that the sleep is only the\r\nbeginning to die, as the suspension of voluntary power in lingering deaths\r\nprecedes for many hours the extinction of the irritative motions.\r\n\r\n21. The following are the characteristic circumstances attending perfect\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n1. The power of volition is totally suspended.\r\n\r\n2. The trains of ideas caused by sensation proceed with greater facility\r\nand vivacity; but become inconsistent with the usual order of nature. The\r\nmuscular motions caused by sensation continue; as those concerned in our\r\nevacuations during infancy, and afterwards in digestion, and in priapismus.\r\n\r\n3. The irritative muscular motions continue, as those concerned in the\r\ncirculation, in secretion, in respiration. But the irritative sensual\r\nmotions, or ideas, are not excited; as the immediate organs of sense are\r\nnot stimulated into action by external objects, which are excluded by the\r\nexternal organs of sense; which are not in sleep adapted to their reception\r\nby the power of volition, as in our waking hours.\r\n\r\n4. The associate motions continue; but their first link is not excited into\r\naction by volition, or by external stimuli. In all respects, except those\r\nabove mentioned, the three last sensorial powers are somewhat increased in\r\nenergy during the suspension of volition, owing to the consequent\r\naccumulation of the spirit of animation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

And total forgetfulness of what passed\r\n    in reverie._ 3. _No suspension of volition in reverie._ 4. _Sensitive\r\n    motions continue, and are consistent._ 5. _Irritative motions continue,\r\n    but are not succeeded by sensation._ 6. _Volition necessary for the\r\n    perception of feeble impressions._ 7. _Associated motions continue._ 8.\r\n    _Nerves of sense are irritable in sleep, but not in reverie._ 9.\r\n    _Somnambuli are not asleep. Contagion received but once._ 10.\r\n    _Definition of reverie._\r\n\r\n1. When we are employed with great sensation of pleasure, or with great\r\nefforts of volition, in the pursuit of some interesting train of ideas, we\r\ncease to be conscious of our existence, are inattentive to time and place,\r\nand do not distinguish this train of sensitive and voluntary ideas from the\r\nirritative ones excited by the presence of external objects, though our\r\norgans of sense are furnished with their accustomed stimuli, till at length\r\nthis interesting train of ideas becomes exhausted, or the appulses of\r\nexternal objects are applied with unusual violence, and we return with\r\nsurprise, or with regret, into the common track of life. This is termed\r\nreverie or studium.\r\n\r\nIn some constitutions these reveries continue a considerable time, and are\r\nnot to be removed without greater difficulty, but are experienced in a less\r\ndegree by us all; when we attend earnestly to the ideas excited by volition\r\nor sensation, with their associated connexions, but are at the same time\r\nconscious at intervals of the stimuli of surrounding bodies. Thus in being\r\npresent at a play, or in reading a romance, some persons are so totally\r\nabsorbed as to forget their usual time of sleep, and to neglect their\r\nmeals; while others are said to have been so involved in voluntary study as\r\nnot to have heard the discharge of artillery; and there is a story of an\r\nItalian politician, who could think so intensely on other subjects, as to\r\nbe insensible to the torture of the rack.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it appears, that these catenations of ideas and muscular\r\nmotions, which form the trains of reverie, are composed both of voluntary\r\nand sensitive associations of them; and that these ideas differ from those\r\nof delirium or of sleep, as they are kept consistent by the power of\r\nvolition; and they differ also from the trains of ideas belonging to\r\ninsanity, as they are as frequently excited by sensation as by volition.\r\nBut lastly, that the whole sensorial power is so employed on these trains\r\nof complete reverie, that like the violent efforts of volition, as in\r\nconvulsions or insanity; or like the great activity of the irritative\r\nmotions in drunkenness; or of the sensitive motions in delirium; they\r\npreclude all sensation consequent to external stimulus.\r\n\r\n2. Those persons, who are said to walk in their sleep, are affected with\r\nreverie to so great a degree, that it becomes a formidable disease; the\r\nessence of which consists in the inaptitude of the mind to attend to\r\nexternal stimuli. Many histories of this disease have been published by\r\nmedical writers; of which there is a very curious one in the Lausanne\r\nTransactions. I shall here subjoin an account of such a case, with its\r\ncure, for the better illustration of this subject.\r\n\r\nA very ingenious and elegant young lady, with light eyes and hair, about\r\nthe age of seventeen, in other respects well, was suddenly seized soon\r\nafter her usual menstruation with this very wonderful malady. The disease\r\nbegan with vehement convulsions of almost every muscle of her body, with\r\ngreat but vain efforts to vomit, and the most violent hiccoughs, that can\r\nbe conceived: these were succeeded in about an hour with a fixed spasm; in\r\nwhich one hand was applied to her head, and the other to support it: in\r\nabout half an hour these ceased, and the reverie began suddenly, and was at\r\nfirst manifest by the look of her eyes and countenance, which seemed to\r\nexpress attention. Then she conversed aloud with imaginary persons with her\r\neyes open, and could not for about an hour be brought to attend to the\r\nstimulus of external objects by any kind of violence, which it was proper\r\nto use; these symptoms returned in this order every day for five or six\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThese conversations were quite consistent, and we could understand, what\r\nshe supposed her imaginary companions to answer, by the continuation of her\r\npart of the discourse. Sometimes she was angry, at other times shewed much\r\nwit and vivacity, but was most frequently inclined to melancholy. In these\r\nreveries she sometimes sung over some music with accuracy, and repeated\r\nwhole pages from the English poets. In repeating some lines from Mr. Pope's\r\nworks she had forgot one word, and began again, endeavouring to recollect\r\nit; when she came to the forgotten word, it was shouted aloud in her ear,\r\nand this repeatedly, to no purpose; but by many trials she at length\r\nregained it herself.\r\n\r\nThese paroxysms were terminated with the appearance of inexpressible\r\nsurprise, and great fear, from which she was some minutes in recovering\r\nherself, calling on her sister with great agitation, and very frequently\r\nunderwent a repetition of convulsions, apparently from the pain of fear.\r\nSee Sect. XVII. 3. 7.\r\n\r\nAfter having thus returned for about an hour every day for two or three\r\nweeks, the reveries seemed to become less complete, and some of their\r\ncircumstances varied; so that she could walk about the room in them without\r\nrunning against any of the furniture; though these motions were at first\r\nvery unsteady and tottering. And afterwards she once drank a dish of tea,\r\nwhen the whole apparatus of the tea-table was set before her; and expressed\r\nsome suspicion, that a medicine was put into it, and once seemed to smell\r\nof a tuberose, which was in flower in her chamber, and deliberated aloud\r\nabout breaking it from the stem, saying, \"it would make her sister so\r\ncharmingly angry.\" At another time in her melancholy moments she heard the\r\nsound of a passing bell, \"I wish I was dead,\" she cried, listening to the\r\nbell, and then taking off one of her shoes, as she sat upon the bed, \"I\r\nlove the colour black,\" says she, \"a little wider, and a little longer,\r\neven this might make me a coffin!\"--Yet it is evident, she was not sensible\r\nat this time, any more than formerly, of seeing or hearing any person about\r\nher; indeed when great light was thrown upon her by opening the shutters of\r\nthe window, her trains of ideas seemed less melancholy; and when I have\r\nforcibly held her hands, or covered her eyes, she appeared to grow\r\nimpatient, and would say, she could not tell what to do, for she could\r\nneither see nor move. In all these circumstances her pulse continued\r\nunaffected as in health. And when the paroxysm was over, she could never\r\nrecollect a single idea of what had passed in it.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing disease, after the use of many other medicines and\r\napplications in vain, was cured by very large doses of opium given about an\r\nhour before the expected returns of the paroxysms; and after a few\r\nrelapses, at the intervals of three or four months, entirely disappeared.\r\nBut she continued at times to have other symptoms of epilepsy.\r\n\r\n3. We shall only here consider, what happened during the time of her\r\nreveries, as that is our present subject; the fits of convulsion belong to\r\nanother part of this treatise. Sect. XXXIV. 1. 4.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no suspension of volition during the fits of\r\nreverie, because she endeavoured to regain the lost idea in repeating the\r\nlines of poetry, and deliberated about breaking the tuberose, and suspected\r\nthe tea to have been medicated.\r\n\r\n4. The ideas and muscular movements depending on sensation were exerted\r\nwith their usual vivacity, and were kept from being inconsistent by the\r\npower of volition, as appeared from her whole conversation, and was\r\nexplained in Sect. XVII. 3. 7. and XVIII. 16.\r\n\r\n5. The ideas and motions dependant on irritation during the first weeks of\r\nher disease, whilst the reverie was complete, were never succeeded by the\r\nsensation of pleasure or pain; as she neither saw, heard, nor felt any of\r\nthe surrounding objects. Nor was it certain that any irritative motions\r\nsucceeded the stimulus of external objects, till the reverie became less\r\ncomplete, and then she could walk about the room without running against\r\nthe furniture of it. Afterwards, when the reverie became still less\r\ncomplete from the use of opium, some few irritations were at times\r\nsucceeded by her attention to them. As when she smelt at a tuberose, and\r\ndrank a dish of tea, but this only when she seemed voluntarily to attend to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n6. In common life when we listen to distant sounds, or wish to distinguish\r\nobjects in the night, we are obliged strongly to exert our volition to\r\ndispose the organs of sense to perceive them, and to suppress the other\r\ntrains of ideas, which might interrupt these feeble sensations. Hence in\r\nthe present history the strongest stimuli were not perceived, except when\r\nthe faculty of volition was exerted on the organ of sense; and then even\r\ncommon stimuli were sometimes perceived: for her mind was so strenuously\r\nemployed in pursuing its own trains of voluntary or sensitive ideas, that\r\nno common stimuli could so far excite her attention as to disunite them;\r\nthat is, the quantity of volition or of sensation already existing was\r\ngreater than any, which could be produced in consequence of common degrees\r\nof stimulation. But the few stimuli of the tuberose, and of the tea, which\r\nshe did perceive, were such, as accidentally coincided with the trains of\r\nthought, which were passing in her mind; and hence did not disunite those\r\ntrains, and create surprise. And their being perceived at all was owing to\r\nthe power of volition preceding or coinciding with that of irritation.\r\n\r\nThis explication is countenanced by a fact mentioned concerning a\r\nsomnambulist in the Lausanne Transactions, who sometimes opened his eyes\r\nfor a short time to examine, where he was, or where his ink-pot stood, and\r\nthen shut them again, dipping his pen into the pot every now and then, and\r\nwriting on, but never opening his eyes afterwards, although he wrote on\r\nfrom line to line regularly, and corrected some errors of the pen, or in\r\nspelling: so much easier was it to him to refer to his ideas of the\r\npositions of things, than to his perceptions of them.\r\n\r\n7. The associated motions persisted in their usual channel, as appeared by\r\nthe combinations of her ideas, and the use of her muscles, and the equality\r\nof her pulse; for the natural motions of the arterial system, though\r\noriginally excited like other motions by stimulus, seem in part to continue\r\nby their association with each other. As the heart of a viper pulsates long\r\nafter it is cut out of the body, and removed from the stimulus of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n8. In the section on sleep, it was observed that the nerves of sense are\r\nequally alive and susceptible to irritation in that state, as when we are\r\nawake; but that they are secluded from stimulating objects, or rendered\r\nunfit to receive them: but in complete reverie the reverse happens, the\r\nimmediate organs of sense are exposed to their usual stimuli; but are\r\neither not excited into action at all, or not into so great action, as to\r\nproduce attention or sensation.\r\n\r\nThe total forgetfulness of what passes in reveries; and the surprise on\r\nrecovering from them, are explained in Section XVIII. 19. and in Section\r\nXVII. 3. 7.\r\n\r\n9. It appears from hence, that reverie is a disease of the epileptic or\r\ncataleptic kind, since the paroxysms of this young lady always began and\r\nfrequently terminated with convulsions; and though in its greatest degree\r\nit has been called somnambulation, or sleep-walking, it is totally\r\ndifferent from sleep; because the essential character of sleep consists in\r\nthe total suspension of volition, which in reverie is not affected; and the\r\nessential character of reverie consists not in the absence of those\r\nirritative motions of our senses, which are occasioned by the stimulus of\r\nexternal objects, but in their never being productive of sensation. So that\r\nduring a fit of reverie that strange event happens to the whole system of\r\nnerves, which occurs only to some particular branches of them in those, who\r\nare a second time exposed to the action of contagious matter. If the matter\r\nof the small-pox be inserted into the arm of one, who has previously had\r\nthat disease, it will stimulate the wound, but the general sensation or\r\ninflammation of the system does not follow, which constitutes the disease.\r\nSee Sect. XII. 3. 6. XXXIII. 2. 8.\r\n\r\n10. The following is the definition or character of complete reverie. 1.\r\nThe irritative motions occasioned by internal stimuli continue, those from\r\nthe stimuli of external objects are either not produced at all, or are\r\nnever succeeded by sensation or attention, unless they are at the same time\r\nexcited by volition. 2. The sensitive motions continue, and are kept\r\nconsistent by the power of volition. 3. The voluntary motions continue\r\nundisturbed. 4. The associate motions continue undisturbed.\r\n\r\nTwo other cases of reverie are related in Section XXXIV. 3. which further\r\nevince, that reverie is an effort of the mind to relieve some painful\r\nsensation, and is hence allied to convulsion, and to insanity. Another case\r\nis related in Class III. 1. 2. 2.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

In learning to walk we judge of the distances of the objects, which we\r\napproach, by the eye; and by observing their perpendicularity determine our\r\nown. This circumstance not having been attended to by the writers on\r\nvision, the disease called vertigo or dizziness has been little understood.\r\n\r\nWhen any person loses the power of muscular action, whether he is erect or\r\nin a sitting posture, he sinks down upon the ground; as is seen in fainting\r\nfits, and other instances of great debility. Hence it follows, that some\r\nexertion of muscular power is necessary to preserve our perpendicular\r\nattitude. This is performed by proportionally exerting the antagonist\r\nmuscles of the trunk, neck, and limbs; and if at any time in our\r\nlocomotions we find ourselves inclining to one side, we either restore our\r\nequilibrium by the efforts of the muscles on the other side, or by moving\r\none of our feet extend the base, which we rest upon, to the new center of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nBut the most easy and habitual manner of determining our want of\r\nperpendicularity, is by attending to the apparent motion of the objects\r\nwithin the sphere of distinct vision; for this apparent motion of objects,\r\nwhen we incline from our perpendicularity, or begin to fall, is as much\r\ngreater than the real motion of the eye, as the diameter of the sphere of\r\ndistinct vision is to our perpendicular height.\r\n\r\nHence no one, who is hood-winked, can walk in a straight line for a hundred\r\nsteps together; for he inclines so greatly, before he is warned of his want\r\nof perpendicularity by the sense of touch, not having the apparent motions\r\nof ambient objects to measure this inclination by, that he is necessitated\r\nto move one of his feet outwards, to the right or to the left, to support\r\nthe new centre of gravity, and thus errs from the line he endeavours to\r\nproceed in.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason many people become dizzy, when they look from the\r\nsummit of a tower, which is raised much above all other objects, as these\r\nobjects are out of the sphere of distinct vision, and they are obliged to\r\nbalance their bodies by the less accurate feelings of their muscles.\r\n\r\nThere is another curious phenomenon belonging to this place, if the\r\ncircumjacent visible objects are so small, that we do not distinguish their\r\nminute parts; or so similar, that we do not know them from each other; we\r\ncannot determine our perpendicularity by them. Thus in a room hung with a\r\npaper, which is coloured over with similar small black lozenges or\r\nrhomboids, many people become dizzy; for when they begin to fall, the next\r\nand the next lozenge succeeds upon the eye; which they mistake for the\r\nfirst, and are not aware, that they have any apparent motion. But if you\r\nfix a sheet of paper, or draw any other figure, in the midst of these\r\nlozenges, the charm ceases, and no dizziness is perceptible.--The same\r\noccurs, when we ride over a plain covered with snow without trees or other\r\neminent objects.\r\n\r\n2. But after having compared visible objects at rest with the sense of\r\ntouch, and learnt to distinguish their shapes and shades, and to measure\r\nour want of perpendicularity by their apparent motions, we come to consider\r\nthem in real motion. Here a new difficulty occurs, and we require some\r\nexperience to learn the peculiar mode of motion of any moving objects,\r\nbefore we can make use of them for the purposes of determining our\r\nperpendicularity. Thus some people become dizzy at the sight of a whirling\r\nwheel, or by gazing on the fluctuations of a river, if no steady objects\r\nare at the same time within the sphere of their distinct vision; and when a\r\nchild first can stand erect upon his legs, if you gain his attention to a\r\nwhite handkerchief steadily extended like a sail, and afterwards make it\r\nundulate, he instantly loses his perpendicularity, and tumbles on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n3. A second difficulty we have to encounter is to distinguish our own real\r\nmovements from the apparent motions of objects. Our daily practice of\r\nwalking and riding on horseback soon instructs us with accuracy to discern\r\nthese modes of motion, and to ascribe the apparent motions of the ambient\r\nobjects to ourselves; but those, which we have not acquired by repeated\r\nhabit, continue to confound us. So as we ride on horseback the trees and\r\ncottages, which occur to us, appear at rest; we can measure their distances\r\nwith our eye, and regulate our attitude by them; yet if we carelessly\r\nattend to distant hills or woods through a thin hedge, which is near us, we\r\nobserve the jumping and progressive motions of them; as this is increased\r\nby the paralax of these objects; which we have not habituated ourselves to\r\nattend to. When first an European mounts an elephant sixteen feet high, and\r\nwhose mode of motion he is not accustomed to, the objects seem to undulate,\r\nas he passes, and he frequently becomes sick and vertiginous, as I am well\r\ninformed. Any other unusual movement of our bodies has the same effect, as\r\nriding backwards in a coach, swinging on a rope, turning round swiftly on\r\none leg, scating on the ice, and a thousand others. So after a patient has\r\nbeen long confined to his bed, when he first attempts to walk, he finds\r\nhimself vertiginous, and is obliged by practice to learn again the\r\nparticular modes of the apparent motions of objects, as he walks by them.\r\n\r\n4. A third difficulty, which occurs to us in learning to balance ourselves\r\nby the eye, is, when both ourselves and the circumjacent objects are in\r\nreal motion. Here it is necessary, that we should be habituated to both\r\nthese modes of motion in order to preserve our perpendicularity. Thus on\r\nhorseback we accurately observe another person, whom we meet, trotting\r\ntowards us, without confounding his jumping and progressive motion with our\r\nown, because we have been accustomed to them both; that is, to undergo the\r\none, and to see the other at the same time. But in riding over a broad and\r\nfluctuating stream, though we are well experienced in the motions of our\r\nhorse, we are liable to become dizzy from our inexperience in that of the\r\nwater. And when first we go on ship-board, where the movements of\r\nourselves, and the movements of the large waves are both new to us, the\r\nvertigo is almost unavoidable with the terrible sickness, which attends it.\r\nAnd this I have been assured has happened to several from being removed\r\nfrom a large ship into a small one; and again from a small one into a man\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n5. From the foregoing examples it is evident, that, when we are surrounded\r\nwith unusual motions, we lose our perpendicularity: but there are some\r\npeculiar circumstances attending this effect of moving objects, which we\r\ncome now to mention, and shall hope from the recital of them to gain some\r\ninsight into the manner of their production.\r\n\r\nWhen a child moves round quick upon one foot, the circumjacent objects\r\nbecome quite indistinct, as their distance increases their apparent\r\nmotions; and this great velocity confounds both their forms, and their\r\ncolours, as is seen in whirling round a many coloured wheel; he then loses\r\nhis usual method of balancing himself by vision, and begins to stagger, and\r\nattempts to recover himself by his muscular feelings. This staggering adds\r\nto the instability of the visible objects by giving a vibratory motion\r\nbesides their rotatory one. The child then drops upon the ground, and the\r\nneighbouring objects seem to continue for some seconds of time to circulate\r\naround him, and the earth under him appears to librate like a balance. In\r\nsome seconds of time these sensations of a continuation of the motion of\r\nobjects vanish; but if he continues turning round somewhat longer, before\r\nhe falls, sickness and vomiting are very liable to succeed. But none of\r\nthese circumstances affect those who have habituated themselves to this\r\nkind of motion, as the dervises in Turkey, amongst whom these swift\r\ngyrations are a ceremony of religion.\r\n\r\nIn an open boat passing from Leith to Kinghorn in Scotland, a sudden change\r\nof the wind shook the undistended sail, and stopt our boat; from this\r\nunusual movement the passengers all vomited except myself. I observed, that\r\nthe undulation of the ship, and the instability of all visible objects,\r\ninclined me strongly to be sick; and this continued or increased, when I\r\nclosed my eyes, but as often as I bent my attention with energy on the\r\nmanagement and mechanism of the ropes and sails, the sickness ceased; and\r\nrecurred again, as often as I relaxed this attention; and I am assured by a\r\ngentleman of observation and veracity, that he has more than once observed,\r\nwhen the vessel has been in immediate danger, that the sea-sickness of the\r\npassengers has instantaneously ceased, and recurred again, when the danger\r\nwas over.\r\n\r\nThose, who have been upon the water in a boat or ship so long, that they\r\nhave acquired the necessary habits of motion upon that unstable element, at\r\ntheir return on land frequently think in their reveries, or between\r\nsleeping and waking, that they observe the room, they sit in, or some of\r\nits furniture, to librate like the motion of the vessel. This I have\r\nexperienced myself, and have been told, that after long voyages, it is some\r\ntime before these ideas entirely vanish. The same is observable in a less\r\ndegree after having travelled some days in a stage coach, and particularly\r\nwhen we lie down in bed, and compose ourselves to sleep; in this case it is\r\nobservable, that the rattling noise of the coach, as well as the undulatory\r\nmotion, haunts us. The drunken vertigo, and the vulgar custom of rocking\r\nchildren, will be considered in the next Section.\r\n\r\n6. The motions, which are produced by the power of volition, may be\r\nimmediately stopped by the exertion of the same power on the antagonist\r\nmuscles; otherwise these with all the other classes of motion continue to\r\ngo on, some time after they are excited, as the palpitation of the heart\r\ncontinues after the object of fear, which occasioned it, is removed. But\r\nthis circumstance is in no class of motions more remarkable than in those\r\ndependent on irritation; thus if any one looks at the sun, and then covers\r\nhis eyes with his hand, he will for many seconds of time, perceive the\r\nimage of the sun marked on his retina: a similar image of all other visible\r\nobjects would remain some time formed on the retina, but is extinguished by\r\nthe perpetual change of the motions of this nerve in our attention to other\r\nobjects. To this must be added, that the longer time any movements have\r\ncontinued to be excited without fatigue to the organ, the longer will they\r\ncontinue spontaneously, after the excitement is withdrawn: as the taste of\r\ntobacco in the mouth after a person has been smoaking it.\r\n\r\nThis taste remains so strong, that if a person continues to draw air\r\nthrough a tobacco pipe in the dark, after having been smoking some time, he\r\ncannot distinguish whether his pipe be lighted or not.\r\n\r\nFrom these two considerations it appears, that the dizziness felt in the\r\nhead, after seeing objects in unusual motion, is no other than a\r\ncontinuation of the motions of the optic nerve excited by those objects and\r\nwhich engage our attention. Thus on turning round on one foot, the vertigo\r\ncontinues for some seconds of time after the person is fallen on the\r\nground; and the longer he has continued to revolve, the longer will\r\ncontinue these successive motions of the parts of the optic nerve.\r\n\r\n    _Additional Observations on _VERTIGO.\r\n\r\n    After revolving with your eyes open till you become vertiginous, as\r\n    soon as you cease to revolve, not only the circum-ambient objects\r\n    appear to circulate round you in a direction contrary to that, in which\r\n    you have been turning, but you are liable to roll your eyes forwards\r\n    and backwards; as is well observed, and ingeniously demonstrated by Dr.\r\n    Wells in a late publication on vision. The same occurs, if you revolve\r\n    with your eyes closed, and open them immediately at the time of your\r\n    ceasing to turn; and even during the whole time of revolving, as may be\r\n    felt by your hand pressed lightly on your closed eyelids. To these\r\n    movements of the eyes, of which he supposes the observer to be\r\n    inconscious, Dr. Wells ascribes the apparent circumgyration of objects\r\n    on ceasing to revolve.\r\n\r\n    The cause of thus turning our eyes forwards, and then back again, after\r\n    our body is at rest, depends, I imagine, on the same circumstance,\r\n    which induces us to follow the indistinct spectra, which are formed on\r\n    one side of the center of the retina, when we observe them apparently\r\n    on clouds, as described in Sect. XL. 2. 2.; and then not being able to\r\n    gain a more distinct vision of them, we turn our eyes back, and again\r\n    and again pursue the flying shade.\r\n\r\n    But this rolling of the eyes, after revolving till we become\r\n    vertiginous, cannot cause the apparent circumgyration of objects, in a\r\n    direction contrary to that in which we have been revolving, for the\r\n    following reasons. 1. Because in pursuing a spectrum in the sky, or on\r\n    the ground, as above mentioned, we perceive no retrograde motions of\r\n    objects. 2. Because the apparent retrograde motions of objects, when we\r\n    have revolved till we are vertiginous, continues much longer than the\r\n    rolling of the eyes above described.\r\n\r\n    3. When we have revolved from right to left, the apparent motion of\r\n    objects, when we stop, is from left to right; and when we have revolved\r\n    from left to right, the apparent circulation of objects is from right\r\n    to left; yet in both these cases the eyes of the revolver are seen\r\n    equally to roll forwards and backwards.\r\n\r\n    4. Because this rolling of the eyes backwards and forwards takes place\r\n    during our revolving, as may be perceived by the hand lightly pressed\r\n    on the closed eyelids, and therefore exists before the effect ascribed\r\n    to it.\r\n\r\n    And fifthly, I now come to relate an experiment, in which the rolling\r\n    of the eyes does not take place at all after revolving, and yet the\r\n    vertigo is more distressing than in the situations above mentioned. If\r\n    any one looks steadily at a spot in the ceiling over his head, or\r\n    indeed at his own finger held up high over his head, and in that\r\n    situation turns round till he becomes giddy; and then stops, and looks\r\n    horizontally; he now finds, that the apparent rotation of objects is\r\n    from above downwards, or from below upwards; that is, that the apparent\r\n    circulation of objects is now vertical instead of horizontal, making\r\n    part of a circle round the axis of his _eye_; and this without any\r\n    rolling of his eyeballs. The reason of there being no rolling of the\r\n    eyeballs, perceived after this experiment, is, because the images of\r\n    objects are formed in rotation round the axis of the eye, and not from\r\n    one side to the other of the axis of it; so that, as the eyeball has\r\n    not power to turn in its socket round its own axis, it cannot follow\r\n    the apparent motions of these evanescent spectra, either before or\r\n    after the body is at rest. From all which arguments it is manifest,\r\n    that these apparent retrograde gyrations of objects are not caused by\r\n    the rolling of the eyeballs; first, because no apparent retrogression\r\n    of objects is observed in other rollings of the eyes: secondly, because\r\n    the apparent retrogression of objects continues many seconds after the\r\n    rolling of the eyeballs ceases. Thirdly, because the apparent\r\n    retrogression of objects is sometimes one way, and sometimes another,\r\n    yet the rolling of the eyeballs is the same. Fourthly, because the\r\n    rolling of the eyeballs exists before the apparent retrograde motions\r\n    of objects is observed; that is, before the revolving person stops. And\r\n    fifthly, because the apparent retrograde gyration of objects is\r\n    produced, when there is no rolling of the eyeballs at all.\r\n\r\n    Doctor Wells imagines, that no spectra can be gained in the eye, if a\r\n    person revolves with his eyelids closed, and thinks this a sufficient\r\n    argument against the opinion, that the apparent progression of the\r\n    spectra of light or colours in the eye can cause the apparent\r\n    retrogression of objects in the vertigo above described; but it is\r\n    certain, when any person revolves in a light room with his eyes closed,\r\n    that he nevertheless perceives differences of light both in quantity\r\n    and colour through his eyelids, as he turns round; and readily gains\r\n    spectra of those differences. And these spectra are not very different\r\n    except in vivacity from those, which he acquires, when he revolves with\r\n    unclosed eyes, since if he then revolves very rapidly the colours and\r\n    forms of surrounding objects are as it were mixed together in his eye;.\r\n    as when, the prismatic colours are painted on a wheel, they appear\r\n    white as they revolve. The truth of this is evinced by the staggering\r\n    or vertigo of men perfectly blind, when they turn round; which is not\r\n    attended with apparent circulation of objects, but is a vertiginous\r\n    disorder of the sense of touch. Blind men balance themselves by their\r\n    sense of touch; which, being less adapted for perceiving small\r\n    deviations from their perpendicular, occasions them to carry themselves\r\n    more erect in walking. This method of balancing themselves by the\r\n    direction of their pressure against the floor, becomes disordered by\r\n    the unusual mode of action in turning round, and they begin to lose\r\n    their perpendicularity, that is, they become vertiginous; but without\r\n    any apparent circular motions of visible objects.\r\n\r\n    It will appear from the following experiments, that the apparent\r\n    progression of the ocular spectra of light or colours is the cause of\r\n    the apparent retrogression of objects, after a person has revolved,\r\n    till he is vertiginous.\r\n\r\n    First, when a person turns round in a light room with his eyes open,\r\n    but closes them before he stops, he will seem to be carried forwards in\r\n    the direction he was turning for a short time after he stops. But if he\r\n    opens his eyes again, the objects before him instantly appear to move\r\n    in a retrograde direction, and he loses the sensation of being carried\r\n    forwards. The same occurs if a person revolves in a light room with his\r\n    eyes closed; when he stops, he seems to be for a time carried forwards,\r\n    if his eyes are still closed; but the instant he opens them, the\r\n    surrounding objects appear to move in retrograde gyration. From hence\r\n    it may be concluded, that it is the sensation or imagination of our\r\n    continuing to go forwards in the direction in which we were turning,\r\n    that causes the apparent retrograde circulation of objects.\r\n\r\n    Secondly, though there is an audible vertigo, as is known by the\r\n    battement, or undulations of sound in the ears, which many vertiginous\r\n    people experience; and though there is also a tangible vertigo, as when\r\n    a blind person turns round, as mentioned above; yet as this\r\n    circumgyration of objects is an hallucination or deception of the sense\r\n    of sight, we are to look for the cause of our appearing to move\r\n    forward, when we stop with our eyes closed after gyration, to some\r\n    affection of this sense. Now, thirdly, if the spectra formed in the eye\r\n    during our rotation, continue to change, when we stand still, like the\r\n    spectra described in Sect. III. 3. 6. such changes must suggest to us\r\n    the idea or sensation of our still continuing to turn round; as is the\r\n    case, when we revolve in a light room, and close our eyes before we\r\n    stop. And lastly, on opening our eyes in the situation above described,\r\n    the objects we chance to view amid these changing spectra in the eye,\r\n    must seem to move in a contrary direction; as the moon sometimes\r\n    appears to move retrograde, when swift-gliding clouds are passing\r\n    forwards so much nearer the eye of the beholder.\r\n\r\n    To make observations on faint ocular spectra requires some degree of\r\n    habit, and composure of mind, and even patience; some of those\r\n    described in Sect. XL. were found difficult to see, by many, who tried\r\n    them; now it happens, that the mind, during the confusion of vertigo,\r\n    when all the other irritative tribes of motion, as well as those of\r\n    vision, are in some degree disturbed, together with the fear of\r\n    falling, is in a very unfit state for the contemplation of such weak\r\n    sensations, as are occasioned by faint ocular spectra. Yet after\r\n    frequently revolving, both with my eyes closed, and with them open, and\r\n    attending to the spectra remaining in them, by shading the light from\r\n    my eyelids more or less with my hand, I at length ceased to have the\r\n    idea of going forward, after I stopped with my eyes closed; and saw\r\n    changing spectra in my eyes, which seemed to move, as it were, over the\r\n    field of vision; till at length, by repeated trials on sunny days, I\r\n    persuaded myself, on opening my eyes, after revolving some time, on a\r\n    shelf of gilded books in my library, that I could perceive the spectra\r\n    in my eyes move forwards over one or two of the books, like the vapours\r\n    in the air of a summer's day; and could so far undeceive myself, as to\r\n    perceive the books to stand still. After more trials I sometimes\r\n    brought myself to believe, that I saw changing spectra of lights and\r\n    shades moving in my eyes, after turning round for some time, but did\r\n    not imagine either the spectra or the objects to be in a state of\r\n    gyration. I speak, however, with diffidence of these facts, as I could\r\n    not always make the experiments succeed, when there was not a strong\r\n    light in my room, or when my eyes were not in the most proper state for\r\n    such observations.\r\n\r\n    The ingenious and learned M. Sauvage has mentioned other theories to\r\n    account for the apparent circumgyration of objects in vertiginous\r\n    people. As the retrograde motions of the particles of blood in the\r\n    optic arteries, by spasm, or by fear, as is seen in the tails of\r\n    tadpoles, and membranes between the fingers of frogs. Another cause he\r\n    thinks may be from the librations to one side, and to the other, of the\r\n    crystalline lens in the eye, by means of involuntary actions of the\r\n    muscles, which constitute the ciliary process. Both these theories lie\r\n    under the same objection as that of Dr. Wells before mentioned; namely,\r\n    that the apparent motions of objects, after the observer has revolved\r\n    for some time, should appear to vibrate this way and that; and not to\r\n    circulate uniformly in a direction contrary to that, in which the\r\n    observer had revolved.\r\n\r\n    M. Sauvage has, lastly, mentioned the theory of colours left in the\r\n    eye, which he has termed impressions on the retina. He says,\r\n    \"Experience teaches us, that impressions made on the retina by a\r\n    visible object remain some seconds after the object is removed; as\r\n    appears from the circle of fire which we see, when a fire-stick is\r\n    whirled round in the dark; therefore when we are carried round our own\r\n    axis in a circle, we undergo a temporary vertigo, when we stop; because\r\n    the impressions of the circumjacent objects remain for a time\r\n    afterwards on the retina.\" Nosolog. Method. Clas. VIII. I. 1. We have\r\n    before observed, that the changes of these colours remaining in the\r\n    eye, evinces them to be motions of the fine terminations of the retina,\r\n    and not impressions on it; as impressions on a passive substance must\r\n    either remain, or cease intirely. See an additional note at the end of\r\n    the second volume.\r\n\r\nAny one, who stands alone on the top of a high tower, if he has not been\r\naccustomed to balance himself by objects placed at such distances and with\r\nsuch inclinations, begins to stagger, and endeavours to recover himself by\r\nhis muscular feelings. During this time the apparent motion of objects at a\r\ndistance below him is very great, and the spectra of these apparent motions\r\ncontinue a little time after he has experienced them; and he is persuaded\r\nto incline the contrary way to counteract their effects; and either\r\nimmediately falls, or applying his hands to the building, uses his muscular\r\nfeelings to preserve his perpendicular attitude, contrary to the erroneous\r\npersuasions of his eyes. Whilst the person, who walks in the dark,\r\nstaggers, but without dizziness; for he neither has the sensation of moving\r\nobjects to take off his attention from his muscular feelings, nor has he\r\nthe spectra of those motions continued on his retina to add to his\r\nconfusion. It happens indeed sometimes to one landing on a tower, that the\r\nidea of his not having room to extend his base by moving one of his feet\r\noutwards, when he begins to incline, superadds fears to his other\r\ninconveniences; which like surprise, joy, or any great degree of sensation,\r\nenervates him in a moment, by employing the whole sensorial power, and by\r\nthus breaking all the associated trains and tribes of motion.\r\n\r\n7. The irritative ideas of objects, whilst we are awake, are perpetually\r\npresent to our sense of sight; as we view the furniture of our rooms, or\r\nthe ground, we tread upon, throughout the whole day without attending to\r\nit. And as our bodies are never at perfect rest during our waking hours,\r\nthese irritative ideas of objects are attended perpetually with irritative\r\nideas of their apparent motions. The ideas of apparent motions are always\r\nirritative ideas, because we never attend to them, whether we attend to the\r\nobjects themselves, or to their real motions, or to neither. Hence the\r\nideas of the apparent motions of objects are a complete circle of\r\nirritative ideas, which continue throughout the day.\r\n\r\nAlso during all our waking hours, there is a perpetual confused sound of\r\nvarious bodies, as of the wind in our rooms, the fire, distant\r\nconversations, mechanic business; this continued buzz, as we are seldom\r\nquite motionless, changes its loudness perpetually, like the sound of a\r\nbell; which rises and falls as long as it continues, and seems to pulsate\r\non the ear. This any one may experience by turning himself round near a\r\nwaterfall; or by striking a glass bell, and then moving the direction of\r\nits mouth towards the ears, or from them, as long as its vibrations\r\ncontinue. Hence this undulation of indistinct sound makes another\r\nconcomitant circle of irritative ideas, which continues throughout the day.\r\n\r\nWe hear this undulating sound, when we are perfectly at rest ourselves,\r\nfrom other sonorous bodies besides bells; as from two organ-pipes, which\r\nare nearly but not quite in unison, when they are sounded together. When a\r\nbell is struck, the circular form is changed into an eliptic one; the\r\nlongest axis of which, as the vibrations continue, moves round the\r\nperiphery of the bell; and when either axis of this elipse is pointed\r\ntowards our ears, the sound is louder; and less when the intermediate parts\r\nof the elipse are opposite to us. The vibrations of the two organ-pipes may\r\nbe compared to Nonius's rule; the sound is louder, when they coincide, and\r\nless at the intermediate times. But, as the sound of bells is the most\r\nfamiliar of those sounds, which have a considerable battement, the\r\nvertiginous patients, who attend to the irritative circles of sounds above\r\ndescribed, generally compare it to the noise of bells.\r\n\r\nThe peristaltic motions of our stomach and intestines, and the secretions\r\nof the various glands, are other circles of irritative motions, some of\r\nthem more or less complete, according to our abstinence or satiety.\r\n\r\nSo that the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of objects, the\r\nirritative battements of sounds, and the movements of our bowels and glands\r\ncompose a great circle of irritative tribes of motion: and when one\r\nconsiderable part of this circle of motions becomes interrupted, the whole\r\nproceeds in confusion, as described in Section XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation of\r\nMotions.\r\n\r\n8. Hence a violent vertigo, from whatever cause it happens, is generally\r\nattended with undulating noise in the head, perversions of the motions of\r\nthe stomach and duodenum, unusual excretion of bile and gastric juice, with\r\nmuch pale urine, sometimes with yellowness of the skin, and a disordered\r\nsecretion of almost every gland of the body, till at length the arterial\r\nsystem is affected, and fever succeeds.\r\n\r\nThus bilious vomitings accompany the vertigo occasioned by the motion of a\r\nship; and when the brain is rendered vertiginous by a paralytic affection\r\nof any part of the body, a vomiting generally ensues, and a great discharge\r\nof bile: and hence great injuries of the head from external violence are\r\nsucceeded with bilious vomitings, and sometimes with abscesses of the\r\nliver. And hence, when a patient is inclined to vomit from other causes, as\r\nin some fevers, any motions of the attendants in his room, or of himself\r\nwhen he is raised or turned in his bed, presently induces the vomiting by\r\nsuperadding a degree of vertigo.\r\n\r\n9. And conversely it is very usual with those, whose stomachs are affected\r\nfrom internal causes, to be afflicted with vertigo, and noise in the head;\r\nsuch is the vertigo of drunken people, which continues, when their eyes are\r\nclosed, and themselves in a recumbent posture, as well as when they are in\r\nan erect posture, and have their eyes open. And thus the irritation of a\r\nstone in the bile-duct, or in the ureter, or an inflammation of any of the\r\nintestines, are accompanied with vomitings and vertigo.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the irritative motions of the stomach, which are in general\r\nnot attended to, become so changed by some unnatural stimulus, as to become\r\nuneasy, and excite our sensation or attention. And thus the other\r\nirritative trains of motions, which are associated with it, become\r\ndisordered by their sympathy. The same happens, when a piece of gravel\r\nsticks in the ureter, or when some part of the intestinal canal becomes\r\ninflamed. In these cases the irritative muscular motions are first\r\ndisturbed by unusual stimulus, and a disordered action of the sensual\r\nmotions, or dizziness ensues. While in sea-sickness the irritative sensual\r\nmotions, as vertigo, precedes; and the disordered irritative muscular\r\nmotions, as those of the stomach in vomiting, follow.\r\n\r\n10. When these irritative motions are disturbed, if the degree be not very\r\ngreat, the exertion of voluntary attention to any other object, or any\r\nsudden sensation, will disjoin these new habits of motion. Thus some\r\ndrunken people have become sober immediately, when any accident has\r\nstrongly excited their attention; and sea-sickness has vanished, when the\r\nship has been in danger. Hence when our attention to other objects is most\r\nrelaxed, as just before we fall asleep, or between our reveries when awake,\r\nthese irritative ideas of motion and sound are most liable to be perceived;\r\nas those, who have been at sea, or have travelled long in a coach, seem to\r\nperceive the vibrations of the ship, or the rattling of the wheels, at\r\nthese intervals; which cease again, as soon as they exert their attention.\r\nThat is, at those intervals they attend to the apparent motions, and to the\r\nbattement of sounds of the bodies around them, and for a moment mistake\r\nthem for those real motions of the ship, and noise of wheels, which they\r\nhad lately been accustomed to: or at these intervals of reverie, or on the\r\napproach of sleep, these supposed motions or sounds may be produced\r\nentirely by imagination.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude from this account of vertigo, that sea-sickness is not an\r\neffort of nature to relieve herself, but a necessary consequence of the\r\nassociations or catenations of animal motions. And may thence infer, that\r\nthe vomiting, which attends the gravel in the ureter, inflammations of the\r\nbowels, and the commencement of some fevers, has a similar origin, and is\r\nnot always an effort of the vis medicatrix naturæ. But where the action of\r\nthe organ is the immediate consequence of the stimulating cause, it is\r\nfrequently exerted to dislodge that stimulus, as in vomiting up an emetic\r\ndrug; at other times, the action of an organ is a general effort to relieve\r\npain, as in convulsions of the locomotive muscles; other actions drink up\r\nand carry on the fluids, as in absorption and secretion; all which may be\r\ntermed efforts of nature to relieve, or to preserve herself.\r\n\r\n11. The cure of vertigo will frequently depend on our previously\r\ninvestigating the cause of it, which from what has been delivered above may\r\noriginate from the disorder of any part of the great tribes of irritative\r\nmotions, and of the associate motions catenated with them.\r\n\r\nMany people, when they arrive at fifty or sixty years of age, are affected\r\nwith slight vertigo; which is generally but wrongly ascribed to\r\nindigestion, but in reality arises from a beginning defect of their sight;\r\nas about this time they also find it necessary to begin to use spectacles,\r\nwhen they read small prints, especially in winter, or by candle light, but\r\nare yet able to read without them during the summer days, when the light is\r\nstronger. These people do not see objects so distinctly as formerly, and by\r\nexerting their eyes more than usual, they perceive the apparent motions of\r\nobjects, and confound them with the real motions of them; and therefore\r\ncannot accurately balance themselves so as easily to preserve their\r\nperpendicularity by them.\r\n\r\nThat is, the apparent motions of objects, which are at rest, as we move by\r\nthem, should only excite irritative ideas: but as these are now become less\r\ndistinct, owing to the beginning imperfection of our sight, we are induced\r\n_voluntarily_ to attend to them; and then these apparent motions become\r\nsucceeded by sensation; and thus the other parts of the trains of\r\nirritative ideas, or irritative muscular motions, become disordered, as\r\nexplained above. In these cases of slight vertigo I have always promised my\r\npatients, that they would get free from it in two or three months, as they\r\nshould acquire the habit of balancing their bodies by less distinct\r\nobjects, and have seldom been mistaken in my prognostic.\r\n\r\nThere is an auditory vertigo, which is called a noise in the head,\r\nexplained in No. 7. of this section, which also is very liable to affect\r\npeople in the advance of life, and is owing to their hearing less perfectly\r\nthan before. This is sometimes called a ringing, and sometimes a singing,\r\nor buzzing, in the ears, and is occasioned by our first experiencing a\r\ndisagreeable sensation from our not being able distinctly to hear the\r\nsounds, we used formerly to hear distinctly. And this disagreeable\r\nsensation excites desire and consequent volition; and when we voluntarily\r\nattend to small indistinct sounds, even the whispering of the air in a\r\nroom, and the pulsations of the arteries of the ear are succeeded by\r\nsensation; which minute sounds ought only to have produced irritative\r\nsensual motions, or unperceived ideas. See Section XVII. 3. 6. These\r\npatients after a while lose this auditory vertigo, by acquiring a new habit\r\nof not attending voluntarily to these indistinct sounds, but contenting\r\nthemselves with the less accuracy of their sense of hearing.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of vertigo begins with the disordered action of some\r\nirritative muscular motions, as those of the stomach from intoxication, or\r\nfrom emetics; or those of the ureter, from the stimulus of a stone lodged\r\nin it; and it is probable, that the disordered motions of some of the great\r\ncongeries of glands, as of those which form the liver, or of the intestinal\r\ncanal, may occasion vertigo in consequence of their motions being\r\nassociated or catenated with the great circles of irritative motions; and\r\nfrom hence it appears, that the means of cure must be adapted to the cause.\r\n\r\nTo prevent sea-sickness it is probable, that the habit of swinging for a\r\nweek or two before going on shipboard might be of service. For the vertigo\r\nfrom failure of sight, spectacles may be used. For the auditory vertigo,\r\næther may be dropt into the ear to stimulate the part, or to dissolve\r\near-wax, if such be a part of the cause. For the vertigo arising from\r\nindigestion, the peruvian bark and a blister are recommended. And for that\r\nowing to a stone in the ureter, venesection, cathartics, opiates, sal soda\r\naerated.\r\n\r\n12. Definition of vertigo. 1. Some of the irritative sensual, or muscular\r\nmotions, which were usually not succeeded by sensation, are in this disease\r\nsucceeded by sensation; and the trains or circles of motions, which were\r\nusually catenated with them, are interrupted, or inverted, or proceed in\r\nconfusion. 2. The sensitive and voluntary motions continue undisturbed. 3.\r\nThe associate trains or circles of motions continue; but their catenations\r\nwith some of the irritative motions are disordered, or inverted, or\r\ndissevered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

In the state of nature when the sense of hunger is appeased by the\r\nstimulus of agreeable food, the business of the day is over, and the human\r\nsavage is at peace with the world, he then exerts little attention to\r\nexternal objects, pleasing reveries of imagination succeed, and at length\r\nsleep is the result: till the nourishment which he has procured, is carried\r\nover every part of the system to repair the injuries of action, and he\r\nawakens with fresh vigour, and feels a renewal of his sense of hunger.\r\n\r\nThe juices of some bitter vegetables, as of the poppy and the laurocerasus,\r\nand the ardent spirit produced in the fermentation of the sugar found in\r\nvegetable juices, are so agreeable to the nerves of the stomach, that,\r\ntaken in a small quantity, they instantly pacify the sense of hunger; and\r\nthe inattention to external stimuli with the reveries of imagination, and\r\nsleep, succeeds, in the same manner as when the stomach is filled with\r\nother less intoxicating food.\r\n\r\nThis inattention to the irritative motions occasioned by external stimuli\r\nis a very important circumstance in the approach of sleep, and is produced\r\nin young children by rocking their cradles: during which all visible\r\nobjects become indistinct to them. An uniform soft repeated sound, as the\r\nmurmurs of a gentle current, or of bees, are said to produce the same\r\neffect, by presenting indistinct ideas of inconsequential sounds, and by\r\nthus stealing our attention from other objects, whilst by their continued\r\nreiterations they become familiar themselves, and we cease gradually to\r\nattend to any thing, and sleep ensues.\r\n\r\n2. After great fatigue or inanition, when the stomach is suddenly filled\r\nwith flesh and vegetable food, the inattention to external stimuli, and the\r\nreveries of imagination, become so conspicuous as to amount to a degree of\r\nintoxication. The same is at any time produced by superadding a little wine\r\nor opium to our common meals; or by taking these separately in considerable\r\nquantity; and this more efficaciously after fatigue or inanition; because a\r\nless quantity of any stimulating material will excite an organ into\r\nenergetic action, after it has lately been torpid from defect of stimulus;\r\nas objects appear more luminous, after we have been in the dark; and\r\nbecause the suspension of volition, which is the immediate cause of sleep,\r\nis sooner induced, after a continued voluntary exertion has in part\r\nexhausted the sensorial power of volition; in the same manner as we cannot\r\ncontract a single muscle long together without intervals of inaction.\r\n\r\n3. In the beginning of intoxication we are inclined to sleep, as mentioned\r\nabove, but by the excitement of external circumstances, as of noise, light,\r\nbusiness, or by the exertion of volition, we prevent the approaches of it,\r\nand continue to take into our stomach greater quantities of the inebriating\r\nmaterials. By these means the irritative movements of the stomach are\r\nexcited into greater action than is natural; and in consequence all the\r\nirritative tribes and trains of motion, which are catenated with them,\r\nbecome susceptible of stronger action from their accustomed stimuli;\r\nbecause these motions are excited both by their usual irritation, and by\r\ntheir association with the increased actions of the stomach and lacteals.\r\nHence the skin glows, and the heat of the body is increased, by the more\r\nenergetic action of the whole glandular system; and pleasure is introduced\r\nin consequence of these increased motions from internal stimulus. According\r\nto Law 5. Sect. IV. on Animal Causation.\r\n\r\nFrom this great increase of irritative motions from internal stimulus, and\r\nthe increased sensation introduced into the system in consequence; and\r\nsecondly, from the increased sensitive motions in consequence of this\r\nadditional quantity of sensation, so much sensorial power is expended, that\r\nthe voluntary power becomes feebly exerted, and the irritation from the\r\nstimulus of external objects is less forcible; the external parts of the\r\neye are not therefore voluntarily adapted to the distances of objects,\r\nwhence the apparent motions of those objects either are seen double, or\r\nbecome too indistinct for the purpose of balancing the body, and vertigo is\r\ninduced.\r\n\r\nHence we become acquainted with that very curious circumstance, why the\r\ndrunken vertigo is attended with an increase of pleasure; for the\r\nirritative ideas and motions occasioned by internal stimulus, that were not\r\nattended to in our sober hours, are now just so much increased as to be\r\nsucceeded by pleasurable sensation, in the same manner as the more violent\r\nmotions of our organs are succeeded by painful sensation. And hence a\r\ngreater quantity of pleasurable sensation is introduced into the\r\nconstitution; which is attended in some people with an increase of\r\nbenevolence and good humour.\r\n\r\nIf the apparent motions of objects is much increased, as when we revolve on\r\none foot, or are swung on a rope, the ideas of these apparent motions are\r\nalso attended to, and are succeeded with pleasureable sensation, till they\r\nbecome familiar to us by frequent use. Hence children are at first\r\ndelighted with these kinds of exercise, and with riding, and failing, and\r\nhence rocking young children inclines them to sleep. For though in the\r\nvertigo from intoxication the irritative ideas of the apparent motions of\r\nobjects are indistinct from their decrease of energy: yet in the vertigo\r\noccasioned by rocking or swinging the irritative ideas of the apparent\r\nmotions of objects are increased in energy, and hence they induce pleasure\r\ninto the system, but are equally indistinct, and in consequence equally\r\nunfit to balance ourselves by. This addition of pleasure precludes desire\r\nor aversion, and in consequence the voluntary power is feebly exerted, and\r\non this account rocking young children inclines them to sleep.\r\n\r\nIn what manner opium and wine act in relieving pain is another article,\r\nthat well deserves our attention. There are many pains that originate from\r\ndefect as well as from excess of stimulus; of these are those of the six\r\nappetites of hunger, thirst, lust, the want of heat, of distention, and of\r\nfresh air. Thus if our cutaneous capillaries cease to act from the\r\ndiminished stimulus of heat, when we are exposed to cold weather, or our\r\nstomach is uneasy for want of food; these are both pains from defect of\r\nstimulus, and in consequence opium, which stimulates all the moving system\r\ninto increased action, must relieve them. But this is not the case in those\r\npains, which arise from excess of stimulus, as in violent inflammations: in\r\nthese the exhibition of opium is frequently injurious by increasing the\r\naction of the system already too great, as in inflammation of the bowels\r\nmortification is often produced by the stimulus of opium. Where, however,\r\nno such bad consequences follow; the stimulus of opium, by increasing all\r\nthe motions of the system, expends so much of the sensorial power, that the\r\nactions of the whole system soon become feebler, and in consequence those\r\nwhich produced the pain and inflammation.\r\n\r\n4. When intoxication proceeds a little further, the quantity of pleasurable\r\nsensation is so far increased, that all desire ceases, for there is no pain\r\nin the system to excite it. Hence the voluntary exertions are diminished,\r\nstaggering and stammering succeed; and the trains of ideas become more and\r\nmore inconsistent from this defect of voluntary exertion, as explained in\r\nthe sections on sleep and reverie, whilst those passions which are unmixed\r\nwith volition are more vividly felt, and shewn with less reserve; hence\r\npining love, or superstitious fear, and the maudling tear dropped on the\r\nremembrance of the most trifling distress.\r\n\r\n5. At length all these circumstances are increased; the quantity of\r\npleasure introduced into the system by the increased irritative muscular\r\nmotions of the whole sanguiferous, and glandular, and absorbent systems,\r\nbecomes so great, that the organs of sense are more forcibly excited into\r\naction by this internal pleasurable sensation, than by the irritation from\r\nthe stimulus of external objects. Hence the drunkard ceases to attend to\r\nexternal stimuli, and as volition is now also suspended, the trains of his\r\nideas become totally inconsistent as in dreams, or delirium: and at length\r\na stupor succeeds from the great exhaustion of sensorial power, which\r\nprobably does not even admit of dreams, and in which, as in apoplexy, no\r\nmotions continue but those from internal stimuli, from sensation, and from\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n6. In other people a paroxysm of drunkenness has another termination; the\r\ninebriate, as soon as he begins to be vertiginous, makes pale urine in\r\ngreat quantities and very frequently, and at length becomes sick, vomits\r\nrepeatedly, or purges, or has profuse sweats, and a temporary fever ensues\r\nwith a quick strong pulse. This in some hours is succeeded by sleep; but\r\nthe unfortunate bacchanalian does not perfectly recover himself till about\r\nthe same time of the succeeding day, when his course of inebriation began.\r\nAs shewn in Sect. XVII. 1. 7. on Catenation. The temporary fever with\r\nstrong pulse is owing to the same cause as the glow on the skin mentioned\r\nin the third paragraph of this Section: the flow of urine and sickness\r\narises from the whole system of irritative motions being thrown into\r\nconfusion by their associations with each other; as in sea-sickness,\r\nmentioned in Sect. XX. 4. on Vertigo; and which is more fully explained in\r\nSection XXIX. on Diabetes.\r\n\r\n7. In this vertigo from internal causes we see objects double, as two\r\ncandles instead of one, which is thus explained. Two lines drawn through\r\nthe axes of our two eyes meet at the object we attend to: this angle of the\r\noptic axes increases or diminishes with the less or greater distances of\r\nobjects. All objects before or behind the place where this angle is formed,\r\nappear double; as any one may observe by holding up a pen between his eyes\r\nand the candle; when he looks attentively at a spot on the pen, and\r\ncarelessly at the candle, it will appear double; and the reverse when he\r\nlooks attentively at the candle and carelessly at the pen; so that in this\r\ncase the muscles of the eye, like those of the limbs, stagger and are\r\ndisobedient to the expiring efforts of volition. Numerous objects are\r\nindeed sometimes seen by the inebriate, occasioned by the refractions made\r\nby the tears, which stand upon his eye-lids.\r\n\r\n8. This vertigo also continues, when the inebriate lies in his bed, in the\r\ndark, or with his eyes closed; and this more powerfully than when he is\r\nerect, and in the light. For the irritative ideas of the apparent motions\r\nof objects are now excited by irritation from internal stimulus, or by\r\nassociation with other irritative motions; and the inebriate, like one in a\r\ndream, believes the objects of these irritative motions to be present, and\r\nfeels himself vertiginous. I have observed in this situation, so long as my\r\neyes and mind were intent upon a book, the sickness and vertigo ceased, and\r\nwere renewed again the moment I discontinued this attention; as was\r\nexplained in the preceding account of sea-sickness. Some drunken people\r\nhave been known to become sober instantly from some accident, that has\r\nstrongly excited their attention, as the pain of a broken bone, or the news\r\nof their house being on fire.\r\n\r\n9. Sometimes the vertigo from internal causes, as from intoxication, or at\r\nthe beginning of some fevers, becomes so universal, that the irritative\r\nmotions which belong to other organs of sense are succeeded by sensation or\r\nattention, as well as those of the eye. The vertiginous noise in the ears\r\nhas been explained in Section XX. on Vertigo. The taste of the saliva,\r\nwhich in general is not attended to, becomes perceptible, and the patients\r\ncomplain of a bad taste in their mouth.\r\n\r\nThe common smells of the surrounding air sometimes excite the attention of\r\nthese patients, and bad smells are complained of, which to other people are\r\nimperceptible. The irritative motions that belong to the sense of pressure,\r\nor of touch, are attended to, and the patient conceives the bed to librate,\r\nand is fearful of falling out of it. The irritative motions belonging to\r\nthe senses of distention, and of heat, like those above mentioned, become\r\nattended to at this time: hence we feel the pulsation of our arteries all\r\nover us, and complain of heat, or of cold, in parts of the body where there\r\nis no accumulation or diminution of actual heat. All which are to be\r\nexplained, as in the last paragraph, by the irritative ideas belonging to\r\nthe various senses being now excited by internal stimuli, or by their\r\nassociations with other irritative motions. And that the inebriate, like\r\none in a dream, believes the external objects, which usually caused these\r\nirritative ideas, to be now present.\r\n\r\n10. The diseases in consequence of frequent inebriety, or of daily taking\r\nmuch vinous spirit without inebriety, consist in the paralysis, which is\r\nliable to succeed violent stimulation. Organs, whose actions are associated\r\nwith others, are frequently more affected than the organ, which is\r\nstimulated into too violent action. See Sect. XXIV. 2. 8. Hence in drunken\r\npeople it generally happens, that the secretory vessels of the liver become\r\nfirst paralytic, and a torpor with consequent gall-stones or schirrus of\r\nthis viscus is induced with concomitant jaundice; otherwise it becomes\r\ninflamed in consequence of previous torpor, and this inflammation is\r\nfrequently transferred to a more sensible part, which is associated with\r\nit, and produces the gout, or the rosy eruption of the face, or some other\r\nleprous eruption on the head, or arms, or legs. Sometimes the stomach is\r\nfirst affected, and paralysis of the lacteal system is induced: whence a\r\ntotal abhorrence from flesh-food, and general emaciation. In others the\r\nlymphatic system is affected with paralysis, and dropsy is the consequence.\r\nIn some inebriates the torpor of the liver produces pain without apparent\r\nschirrus, or gall stones, or inflammation, or consequent gout, and in these\r\nepilepsy or insanity are often the consequence. All which will be more\r\nfully treated of in the course of the work.\r\n\r\nI am well aware, that it is a common opinion, that the gout is as\r\nfrequently owing to gluttony in eating, as to intemperance in drinking\r\nfermented or spirituous liquors. To this I answer, that I have seen no\r\nperson afflicted with the gout, who has not drank freely of fermented\r\nliquor, as wine and water, or small beer; though as the disposition to all\r\nthe diseases, which have originated from intoxication, is in some degree\r\nhereditary, a less quantity of spirituous potation will induce the gout in\r\nthose, who inherit the disposition from their parents. To which I must add,\r\nthat in young people the rheumatism is frequently mistaken for the gout.\r\n\r\nSpice is seldom taken in such quantity as to do any material injury to the\r\nsystem, flesh-meats as well as vegetables are the natural diet of mankind;\r\nwith these a glutton may be crammed up to the throat, and fed fat like a\r\nstalled ox; but he will not be diseased, unless he adds spirituous or\r\nfermented liquor to his food. This is well known in the distilleries, where\r\nthe swine, which are fattened by the spirituous sediments of barrels,\r\nacquire diseased livers. But mark what happens to a man, who drinks a quart\r\nof wine or of ale, if he has not been habituated to it. He loses the use\r\nboth of his limbs and of his understanding! He becomes a temporary idiot,\r\nand has a temporary stroke of the palsy! And though he slowly recovers\r\nafter some hours, is it not reasonable to conclude, that a perpetual\r\nrepetition of so powerful a poison must at length permanently affect\r\nhim?--If a person accidentally becomes intoxicated by eating a few\r\nmushrooms of a peculiar kind, a general alarm is excited, and he is said to\r\nbe poisoned, and emetics are exhibited; but so familiarised are we to the\r\nintoxication from vinous spirit, that it occasions laughter rather than\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nThere is however considerable danger in too hastily discontinuing the use\r\nof so strong a stimulus, lest the torpor of the system, or paralysis,\r\nshould sooner be induced by the omission than by the continuance of this\r\nhabit, when unfortunately acquired. A golden rule for determining the\r\nquantity, which may with safety be discontinued, is delivered in Sect. XII.\r\n7. 8.\r\n\r\n11. Definition of drunkenness. Many of the irritative motions are much\r\nincreased in energy by internal stimulation.\r\n\r\n2. A great additional quantity of pleasurable sensation is occasioned by\r\nthis increased exertion of the irritative motions. And many sensitive\r\nmotions are produced in consequence of this increased sensation.\r\n\r\n3. The associated trains and tribes of motions, catenated with the\r\nincreased irritative and sensitive motions, are disturbed, and proceed in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n4. The faculty of volition is gradually impaired, whence proceeds the\r\ninstability of locomotion, inaccuracy of perception, and inconsistency of\r\nideas; and is at length totally suspended, and a temporary apoplexy\r\nsucceeds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXII.\r\n\r\nOF PROPENSITY TO MOTION, REPETITION AND IMITATION.\r\n\r\n    I. _Accumulation of sensorial power in hemiplagia, in sleep, in cold\r\n    fit of fever, in the locomotive muscles, in the organs of sense.\r\n    Produces propensity to action._ II. _Repetition by three sensorial\r\n    powers. In rhimes and alliterations, in music, dancing, architecture,\r\n    landscape-painting, beauty._ III. 1. _Perception consists in imitation.\r\n    Four kinds of imitation._ 2. _Voluntary. Dogs taught to dance._ 3.\r\n    _Sensitive. Hence sympathy, and all our virtues. Contagious matter of\r\n    venereal ulcers, of hydrophobia, of jail-fever, of small-pox, produced\r\n    by imitation, and the sex of the embryon._ 4. _Irritative imitation._\r\n    5. _Imitations resolvable into associations._\r\n\r\nI. 1. In the hemiplagia, when the limbs on one side have lost their power\r\nof voluntary motion, the patient is for many days perpetually employed in\r\nmoving those of the other. 2. When the voluntary power is suspended during\r\nsleep, there commences a ceaseless flow of sensitive motions, or ideas of\r\nimagination, which compose our dreams. 3. When in the cold fit of an\r\nintermittent fever some parts of the system have for a time continued\r\ntorpid, and have thus expended less than their usual expenditure of\r\nsensorial power; a hot fit succeeds, with violent action of those vessels,\r\nwhich had previously been quiescent. All these are explained from an\r\naccumulation of sensorial power during the inactivity of some part of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nBesides the very great quantity of sensorial power perpetually produced and\r\nexpended in moving the arterial, venous, and glandular systems, with the\r\nvarious organs or digestion, as described in Section XXXII. 3. 2. there is\r\nalso a constant expenditure of it by the action of our locomotive muscles\r\nand organs of sense. Thus the thickness of the optic nerves, where they\r\nenter the eye, and the great expansion of the nerves of touch beneath the\r\nwhole of the cuticle, evince the great consumption of sensorial power by\r\nthese senses. And our perpetual muscular actions in the common offices of\r\nlife, and in constantly preserving the perpendicularity of our bodies\r\nduring the day, evince a considerable expenditure of the spirit of\r\nanimation by our locomotive muscles. It follows, that if the exertion of\r\nthese organs of sense and muscles be for a while intermitted, that some\r\nquantity of sensorial power must be accumulated, and a propensity to\r\nactivity of some kind ensue from the increased excitability of the system.\r\nWhence proceeds the irksomeness of a continued attitude, and of an indolent\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHowever small this hourly accumulation of the spirit of animation may be,\r\nit produces a propensity to some kind of action; but it nevertheless\r\nrequires either desire or aversion, either pleasure or pain, or some\r\nexternal stimulus, or a previous link of association, to excite the system\r\ninto activity; thus it frequently happens, when the mind and body are so\r\nunemployed as not to possess any of the three first kinds of stimuli, that\r\nthe last takes place, and consumes the small but perpetual accumulation of\r\nsensorial power. Whence some indolent people repeat the same verse for\r\nhours together, or hum the same tune. Thus the poet:\r\n\r\n  Onward he trudged, not knowing what he sought,\r\n  And whistled, as he went, for want of thought.\r\n\r\nII. The repetitions of motions may be at first produced either by volition,\r\nor by sensation, or by irritation, but they soon become easier to perform\r\nthan any other kinds of action, because they soon become associated\r\ntogether, according to Law the seventh, Section IV. on Animal Causation.\r\nAnd because their frequency of repetition, if as much sensorial power be\r\nproduced during every reiteration as is expended, adds to the facility of\r\ntheir production.\r\n\r\nIf a stimulus be repeated at uniform intervals of time, as described in\r\nSect. XII. 3. 3. the action, whether of our muscles or organs of sense, is\r\nproduced with still greater facility or energy; because the sensorial power\r\nof association, mentioned above, is combined with the sensorial power of\r\nirritation; that is, in common language, the acquired habit assists the\r\npower of the stimulus.\r\n\r\nThis not only obtains in the annual, lunar, and diurnal catenations of\r\nanimal motions, as explained in Sect. XXXVI. which are thus performed with\r\ngreat facility and energy; but in every less circle of actions or ideas, as\r\nin the burthen of a song, or the reiterations of a dance. To the facility\r\nand distinctness, with which we hear sounds at repeated intervals, we owe\r\nthe pleasure, which we receive from musical time, and from poetic time; as\r\ndescribed in Botanic Garden, P. 2. Interlude 3. And to this the pleasure we\r\nreceive from the rhimes and alliterations of modern verification; the\r\nsource of which without this key would be difficult to discover. And to\r\nthis likewise should be ascribed the beauty of the duplicature in the\r\nperfect tense of the Greek verbs, and of some Latin ones, as tango tetegi,\r\nmordeo momordi.\r\n\r\nThere is no variety of notes referable to the gamut in the beating of the\r\ndrum, yet if it be performed in musical time, it is agreeable to our ears;\r\nand therefore this pleasurable sensation must be owing to the repetition of\r\nthe divisions of the sounds at certain intervals of time, or musical bars.\r\nWhether these times or bars are distinguished by a pause, or by an\r\nemphasis, or accent, certain it is, that this distinction is perpetually\r\nrepeated; otherwise the ear could not determine instantly, whether the\r\nsuccessions of sound were in common or in triple time. In common time there\r\nis a division between every two crotchets, or other notes of equivalent\r\ntime; though the bar in written music is put after every fourth crotchet,\r\nor notes equivalent in time; in triple time the division or bar is after\r\nevery three crotchets, or notes equivalent; so that in common time the\r\nrepetition recurs more frequently than in triple time. The grave or heroic\r\nverses of the Greek and Latin poets are written in common time; the French\r\nheroic verses, and Mr. Anstie's humorous verses in his Bath Guide, are\r\nwritten in the same time as the Greek and Latin verses, but are one bar\r\nshorter. The English grave or heroic verses are measured by triple time, as\r\nMr. Pope's translation of Homer.\r\n\r\nBut besides these little circles of musical time, there are the greater\r\nreturning periods, and the still more distant choruses, which, like the\r\nrhimes at the ends of verses, owe their beauty to repetition; that is, to\r\nthe facility and distinctness with which we perceive sounds, which we\r\nexpect to perceive, or have perceived before; or in the language of this\r\nwork, to the greater ease and energy with which our organ is excited by the\r\ncombined sensorial powers of association and irritation, than by the latter\r\nsingly.\r\n\r\nA certain uniformity or repetition of parts enters the very composition of\r\nharmony. Thus two octaves nearest to each other in the scale commence their\r\nvibrations together after every second vibration of the higher one. And\r\nwhere the first, third, and fifth compose a chord the vibrations concur or\r\ncoincide frequently, though less to than in the two octaves. It is probable\r\nthat these chords bear some analogy to a mixture of three alternate colours\r\nin the sun's spectrum separated by a prism.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure we receive from a melodious succession of notes referable to\r\nthe gamut is derived from another source, viz. to the pandiculation or\r\ncounteraction of antagonist fibres. See Botanic Garden, P. 2. Interlude 3.\r\nIf to these be added our early associations of agreeable ideas with certain\r\nproportions of sound, I suppose, from these three sources springs all the\r\ndelight of music, so celebrated by ancient authors, and so enthusiastically\r\ncultivated at present. See Sect. XVI. No. 10. on Instinct.\r\n\r\nThis kind of pleasure arising from repetition, that is from the facility\r\nand distinctness, with which we perceive and understand repeated\r\nsensations, enters into all the agreeable arts; and when it is carried to\r\nexcess is termed formality. The art of dancing like that of music depends\r\nfor a great part of the pleasure, it affords, on repetition; architecture,\r\nespecially the Grecian, consists of one part being a repetition of another;\r\nand hence the beauty of the pyramidal outline in landscape-painting; where\r\none side of the picture may be said in some measure to balance the other.\r\nSo universally does repetition contribute to our pleasure in the fine arts,\r\nthat beauty itself has been defined by some writers to consist in a due\r\ncombination of uniformity and variety. See Sect. XVI. 6.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Man is termed by Aristotle an imitative animal; this propensity to\r\nimitation not only appears in the actions of children, but in all the\r\ncustoms and fashions of the world: many thousands tread in the beaten paths\r\nof others, for one who traverses regions of his own discovery. The origin\r\nof this propensity of imitation has not, that I recollect, been deduced\r\nfrom any known principle; when any action presents itself to the view of a\r\nchild, as of whetting a knife, or threading a needle, the parts of this\r\naction in respect of time, motion, figure, is imitated by a part of the\r\nretina of his eye; to perform this action therefore with his hands is\r\neasier to him than to invent any new action, because it consists in\r\nrepeating with another set of fibres, viz. with the moving muscles, what he\r\nhad just performed by some parts of the retina; just as in dancing we\r\ntransfer the times of motion from the actions of the auditory nerves to the\r\nmuscles of the limbs. Imitation therefore consists of repetition, which we\r\nhave shewn above to be the easiest kind of animal action, and which we\r\nperpetually fall into, when we possess an accumulation of sensorial power,\r\nwhich is not otherwise called into exertion.\r\n\r\nIt has been shewn, that our ideas are configurations of the organs of\r\nsense, produced originally in consequence of the stimulus of external\r\nbodies. And that these ideas, or configurations of the organs of sense,\r\nreferable in some property a correspondent property of external matter; as\r\nthe parts of the senses of light and of touch, which are excited into\r\naction, resemble in figure the figure of the stimulating body; and probably\r\nalso the colour, and the quantity of density, which they perceive. As\r\nexplained in Sect. XIV. 2. 2. Hence it appears, that our perceptions\r\nthemselves are copies, that is, imitations of some properties of external\r\nmatter; and the propensity to imitation is thus interwoven with our\r\nexistence, as it is produced by the stimuli of external bodies, and is\r\nafterwards repeated by our volitions and sensations, and thus constitutes\r\nall the operations of our minds.\r\n\r\n2. Imitations resolve themselves into four kinds, voluntary, sensitive,\r\nirritative, and associate. The voluntary imitations are, when we imitate\r\ndeliberately the actions of others, either by mimicry, as in acting a play,\r\nor in delineating a flower; or in the common actions of our lives, as in\r\nour dress, cookery, language, manners, and even in our habits of thinking.\r\n\r\nNot only the greatest part of mankind learn all the common arts of life by\r\nimitating others, but brute animals seem capable of acquiring knowledge\r\nwith greater facility by imitating each other, than by any methods by which\r\nwe can teach them; as dogs and cats, when they are sick, learn of each\r\nother to eat grass; and I suppose, that by making an artificial dog perform\r\ncertain tricks, as in dancing on his hinder legs, a living dog might be\r\neasily induced to imitate them; and that the readiest way of instructing\r\ndumb animals is by practising them with others of the same species, which\r\nhave already learned the arts we wish to teach them. The important use of\r\nimitation in acquiring natural language is mentioned in Section XVI. 7. and\r\n8. on Instinct.\r\n\r\n3. The sensitive imitations are the immediate consequences of pleasure or\r\npain, and these are often produced even contrary to the efforts of the\r\nwill. Thus many young men on seeing cruel surgical operations become sick,\r\nand some even feel pain in the parts of their own bodies, which they see\r\ntortured or wounded in others; that is, they in some measure imitate by the\r\nexertions of their own fibres the violent actions, which they witnessed in\r\nthose of others. In this case a double imitation takes place, first the\r\nobserver imitates with the extremities of the optic nerve the mangled\r\nlimbs, which are present before his eyes; then by a second imitation he\r\nexcites to violent action of the fibres of his own limbs as to produce pain\r\nin those parts of his own body, which he saw wounded in another. In these\r\npains produced by imitation the effect has some similarity to the cause,\r\nwhich distinguishes them from those produced by association; as the pains\r\nof the teeth, called tooth-edge, which are produced by association with\r\ndisagreeable sounds, as explained in Sect. XVI. 10.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this powerful agent, imitation, in the moral world, is\r\nmentioned in Sect. XVI. 7. as it is the foundation of all our intellectual\r\nsympathies with the pains and pleasures of others, and is in consequence\r\nthe source of all our virtues. For in what consists our sympathy with the\r\nmiseries, or with the joys, of our fellow creatures, but in an involuntary\r\nexcitation of ideas in some measure similar or imitative of those, which we\r\nbelieve to exist in the minds of the persons, whom we commiserate or\r\ncongratulate?\r\n\r\nThere are certain concurrent or successive actions of some of the glands,\r\nor other parts of the body, which are possessed of sensation, which become\r\nintelligible from this propensity to imitation. Of these are the production\r\nof matter by the membranes of the fauces, or by the skin, in consequence of\r\nthe venereal disease previously affecting the parts of generation. Since as\r\nno fever is excited, and as neither the blood of such patients, nor even\r\nthe matter from ulcers of the throat, or from cutaneous ulcers, will by\r\ninoculation produce the venereal disease in others, as observed by Mr.\r\nHunter, there is reason to conclude, that no contagious matter is conveyed\r\nthither by the blood-vessels, but that a milder matter is formed by the\r\nactions of the fine vessels in those membranes imitating each other. See\r\nSection XXXIII. 2. 9. In this disease the actions of these vessels\r\nproducing ulcers on the throat and skin are imperfect imitations of those\r\nproducing chanker, or gonorrhoea; since the matter produced by them is not\r\ninfectious, while the imitative actions in the hydrophobia appear to be\r\nperfect resemblances, as they produce a material equally infectious with\r\nthe original one, which induced them.\r\n\r\nThe contagion from the bite of a mad dog differs from other contagious\r\nmaterials, from its being communicable from other animals to mankind, and\r\nfrom many animals to each other; the phenomena attending the hydrophobia\r\nare in some degree explicable on the foregoing theory. The infectious\r\nmatter does not appear to enter the circulation, as it cannot be traced\r\nalong the course of the lymphatics from the wound, nor is there any\r\nswelling of the lymphatic glands, nor does any fever attend, as occurs in\r\nthe small-pox, and in many other contagious diseases; yet by some unknown\r\nprocess the disease is communicated from the wound to the throat, and that\r\nmany months after the injury, so as to produce pain and hydrophobia, with a\r\nsecretion of infectious saliva of the same kind, as that of the mad dog,\r\nwhich inflicted the wound.\r\n\r\nThis subject is very intricate.--It would appear, that by certain morbid\r\nactions of the salivary glands of the mad dog, a peculiar kind of saliva is\r\nproduced; which being instilled into a wound of another animal stimulates\r\nthe cutaneous or mucous glands into morbid actions, but which are\r\nineffectual in respect to the production of a similar contagious material;\r\nbut the salivary glands by irritative sympathy are thrown into similar\r\naction, and produce an infectious saliva similar to that instilled into the\r\nwound.\r\n\r\nThough in many contagious fevers a material similar to that which produced\r\nthe disease, is thus generated by imitation; yet there are other infectious\r\nmaterials, which do not thus propagate themselves, but which seem to act\r\nlike slow poisons. Of this kind was the contagious matter, which produced\r\nthe jail-fever at the assizes at Oxford about a century ago. Which, though\r\nfatal to so many, was not communicated to their nurses or attendants. In\r\nthese cases, the imitations of the fine vessels, as above described, appear\r\nto be imperfect, and do not therefore produce a matter similar to that,\r\nwhich stimulates them; in this circumstance resembling the venereal matter\r\nin ulcers of the throat or skin, according to the curious discovery of Mr.\r\nHunter above related, who found, by repeated inoculations, that it would\r\nnot infect. Hunter on Venereal Disease, Part vi. ch. 1.\r\n\r\nAnother example of morbid imitation is in the production of a great\r\nquantity of contagious matter, as in the inoculated small-pox, from a small\r\nquantity of it inserted into the arm, and probably diffused in the blood.\r\nThese particles of contagious matter stimulate the extremities of the fine\r\narteries of the skin, and cause them to imitate some properties of those\r\nparticles of contagious matter, so as to produce a thousandfold of a\r\nsimilar material. See Sect. XXXIII. 2. 6. Other instances are mentioned in\r\nthe Section on Generation, which shew the probability that the extremities\r\nof the seminal glands may imitate certain ideas of the mind, or actions of\r\nthe organs of sense, and thus occasion the male or female sex of the\r\nembryon. See Sect. XXXIX. 6.\r\n\r\n4. We come now to those imitations, which are not attended with sensation.\r\nOf these are all the irritative ideas already explained, as when the retina\r\nof the eye imitates by its action or configuration the tree or the bench,\r\nwhich I shun in walking past without attending to them. Other examples of\r\nthese irritative imitations are daily observable in common life; thus one\r\nyawning person shall set a whole company a yawning; and some have acquired\r\nwinking of the eyes or impediments of speech by imitating their companions\r\nwithout being conscious of it.\r\n\r\n5. Besides the three species of imitations above described there may be\r\nsome associate motions, which may imitate each other in the kind as well as\r\nin the quantity of their action; but it is difficult to distinguish them\r\nfrom the associations of motions treated of in Section XXXV. Where the\r\nactions of other persons are imitated there can be no doubt, or where we\r\nimitate a preconceived idea by exertion of our locomotive muscles, as in\r\npainting a dragon; all these imitations may aptly be referred to the\r\nsources above described of the propensity to activity, and the facility of\r\nrepetition; at the same time I do not affirm, that all those other apparent\r\nsensitive and irritative imitations may not be resolvable into associations\r\nof a peculiar kind, in which certain distant parts of similar irritability\r\nor sensibility, and which have habitually acted together, may affect each\r\nother exactly with the same kinds of motion; as many parts are known to\r\nsympathise in the quantity of their motions. And that therefore they may be\r\nultimately resolvable into associations of action, as described in Sect.\r\nXXXV.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n    I. _The heart and arteries have no antagonist muscles. Veins absorb the\r\n    blood, propel it forwards, and distend the heart; contraction of the\r\n    heart distends the arteries. Vena portarum._ II. _Glands which take\r\n    their fluids from the blood. With long necks, with short necks._ III.\r\n    _Absorbent system._ IV. _Heat given out from glandular secretions.\r\n    Blood changes colour in the lungs and in the glands and capillaries._\r\n    V. _Blood is absorbed by veins, as chyle by lacteal vessels, otherwise\r\n    they could not join their streams._ VI. _Two kinds of stimulus,\r\n    agreeable and disagreeable. Glandular appetency. Glands originally\r\n    possessed sensation._\r\n\r\nI. We now step forwards to illustrate some of the phenomena of diseases,\r\nand to trace out their most efficacious methods of cure; and shall commence\r\nthis subject with a short description of the circulatory system.\r\n\r\nAs the nerves, whose extremities form our various organs of sense and\r\nmuscles, are all joined, or communicate, by means of the brain, for the\r\nconvenience perhaps of the distribution of a subtile ethereal fluid for the\r\npurpose of motion; so all those vessels of the body, which carry the\r\ngrosser fluids for the purposes of nutrition, communicate with each other\r\nby the heart.\r\n\r\nThe heart and arteries are hollow muscles, and are therefore indued with\r\npower of contraction in consequence of stimulus, like all other muscular\r\nfibres; but, as they have no antagonist muscles, the cavities of the\r\nvessels, which they form, would remain for ever closed, after they have\r\ncontracted themselves, unless some extraneous power be applied to again\r\ndistend them. This extraneous power in respect to the heart is the current\r\nof blood, which is perpetually absorbed by the veins from the various\r\nglands and capillaries, and pushed into the heart by a power probably very\r\nsimilar to that, which raises the sap in vegetables in the spring, which,\r\naccording to Dr. Hale's experiment on the stump of a vine, exerted a force\r\nequal to a column of water above twenty feet high. This force of the\r\ncurrent of blood in the veins is partly produced by their absorbent power,\r\nexerted at the beginning of every fine ramification; which may be conceived\r\nto be a mouth absorbing blood, as the mouths of the lacteals and lymphatics\r\nabsorb chyle and lymph. And partly by their intermitted compression by the\r\npulsations of their generally concomitant arteries; by which the blood is\r\nperpetually propelled towards the heart, as the valves in many veins, and\r\nthe absorbent mouths in them all, will not suffer it to return.\r\n\r\nThe blood, thus forcibly injected into the chambers of the heart, distends\r\nthis combination of hollow muscles; till by the stimulus of distention they\r\ncontract themselves; and, pushing forwards the blood into the arteries,\r\nexert sufficient force to overcome in less than a second of time the vis\r\ninertiæ, and perhaps some elasticity, of the very extensive ramifications\r\nof the two great systems of the aortal and pulmonary arteries. The power\r\nnecessary to do this in so short a time must be considerable, and has been\r\nvariously estimated by different physiologists.\r\n\r\nThe muscular coats of the arterial system are then brought into action by\r\nthe stimulus of distention, and propel the blood to the mouths, or through\r\nthe convolutions, which precede the secretory apertures of the various\r\nglands and capillaries.\r\n\r\nIn the vessels of the liver there is no intervention of the heart; but the\r\nvena portarum, which does the office of an artery, is distended by the\r\nblood poured into it from the mesenteric veins, and is by this distention\r\nstimulated to contract itself, and propel the blood to the mouths of the\r\nnumerous glands, which compose that viscus.\r\n\r\nII. The glandular system of vessels may be divided into those, which take\r\nsome fluid from the circulation; and those, which give something to it.\r\nThose, which take their fluid from the circulation are the various glands,\r\nby which the tears, bile, urine, perspiration, and many other secretions\r\nare produced; these glands probably consist of a mouth to select, a belly\r\nto digest, and an excretory aperture to emit their appropriated fluids; the\r\nblood is conveyed by the power of the heart and arteries to the mouths of\r\nthese glands, it is there taken up by the living power of the gland, and\r\ncarried forwards to its belly, and excretory aperture, where a part is\r\nseparated, and the remainder absorbed by the veins for further purposes.\r\n\r\nSome of these glands are furnished with long convoluted necks or tubes, as\r\nthe seminal ones, which are curiously seen when injected with quicksilver.\r\nOthers seem to consist of shorter tubes, as that great congeries of glands,\r\nwhich constitute the liver, and those of the kidneys. Some have their\r\nexcretory apertures opening into reservoirs, as the urinary and\r\ngall-bladders. And others on the external body, as those which secrete the\r\ntears, and perspirable matter.\r\n\r\nAnother great system of glands, which have very short necks, are the\r\ncapillary vessels; by which the insensible perspiration is secreted on the\r\nskin; and the mucus of various consistences, which lubricates the\r\ninterstices of the cellular membrane, of the muscular fibres, and of all\r\nthe larger cavities of the body. From the want of a long convolution of\r\nvessels some have doubted, whether these capillaries should be considered\r\nas glands, and have been led to conclude, that the perspirable matter\r\nrather exuded than was secreted. But the fluid of perspiration is not\r\nsimple water, though that part of it, which exhales into the air may be\r\nsuch; for there is another part of it, which in a state of health is\r\nabsorbed again; but which, when the absorbents are diseased, remains on the\r\nsurface of the skin, in the form of scurf, or indurated mucus. Another\r\nthing, which shews their similitude to other glands, is their sensibility\r\nto certain affections of the mind; as is seen in the deeper colour of the\r\nskin in the blush of shame, or the greater paleness of it from fear.\r\n\r\nIII. Another series of glandular vessels is called the absorbent system;\r\nthese open their mouths into all the cavities, and upon all those surfaces\r\nof the body, where the excretory apertures of the other glands pour out\r\ntheir fluids. The mouths of the absorbent system drink up a part or the\r\nwhole of these fluids, and carry them forwards by their living power to\r\ntheir respective glands, which are called conglobate glands. There these\r\nfluids undergo some change, before they pass on into the circulation; but\r\nif they are very acrid, the conglobate gland swells, and sometimes\r\nsuppurates, as in inoculation of the small-pox, in the plague, and in\r\nvenereal absorptions; at other times the fluid may perhaps continue there,\r\ntill it undergoes some chemical change, that renders it less noxious; or,\r\nwhat is more likely, till it is regurgitated by the retrograde motion of\r\nthe gland in spontaneous sweats or diarrhoeas, as disagreeing food is\r\nvomited from the stomach.\r\n\r\nIV. As all the fluids, that pass through these glands, and capillary\r\nvessels, undergo a chemical change, acquiring new combinations, the matter\r\nof heat is at the same time given out; this is apparent, since whatever\r\nincreases insensible perspiration, increases the heat of the skin; and when\r\nthe action of these vessels is much increased but for a moment, as in\r\nblushing, a vivid heat on the skin is the immediate consequence. So when\r\ngreat bilious secretions, or those of any other gland, are produced, heat\r\nis generated in the part in proportion to the quantity of the secretion.\r\n\r\nThe heat produced on the skin by blushing may be thought by some too sudden\r\nto be pronounced a chemical effect, as the fermentations or new\r\ncombinations taking place in a fluid is in general a slower process. Yet\r\nare there many chemical mixtures in which heat is given out as\r\ninstantaneously; as in solutions of metals in acids, or in mixtures of\r\nessential oils and acids, as of oil of cloves and acid of nitre. So the\r\nbruised parts of an unripe apple become almost instantaneously sweet; and\r\nif the chemico-animal process of digestion be stopped for but a moment, as\r\nby fear, or even by voluntary eructation, a great quantity of air is\r\ngenerated, by the fermentation, which instantly succeeds the stop of\r\ndigestion. By the experiments of Dr. Hales it appears, that an apple during\r\nfermentation gave up above six hundred times its bulk of air; and the\r\nmaterials in the stomach are such, and in such a situation, as immediately\r\nto run into fermentation, when digestion is impeded.\r\n\r\nAs the blood passes through the small vessels of the lungs, which connect\r\nthe pulmonary artery and vein, it undergoes a change of colour from a dark\r\nto a light red; which may be termed a chemical change, as it is known to be\r\neffected by an admixture of oxygene, or vital air; which, according to a\r\ndiscovery of Dr. Priestley, passes through the moist membranes, which\r\nconstitute the sides of these vessels. As the blood passes through the\r\ncapillary vessels, and glands, which connect the aorta and its various\r\nbranches with their correspondent veins in the extremities of the body, it\r\nagain loses the bright red colour, and undergoes some new combinations in\r\nthe glands or capillaries, in which the matter of heat is given out from\r\nthe secreted fluids. This process therefore, as well as the process of\r\nrespiration, has some analogy to combustion, as the vital air or oxygene\r\nseems to become united to some inflammable base, and the matter of heat\r\nescapes from the new acid, which is thus produced.\r\n\r\nV. After the blood has passed these glands and capillaries, and parted with\r\nwhatever they chose to take from it, the remainder is received by the\r\nveins, which are a set of blood-absorbing vessels in general corresponding\r\nwith the ramifications of the arterial system. At the extremity of the fine\r\nconvolutions of the glands the arterial force ceases; this in respect to\r\nthe capillary vessels, which unite the extremities of the arteries with the\r\ncommencement of the veins, is evident to the eye, on viewing the tail of a\r\ntadpole by means of a solar, or even by a common microscope, for globules\r\nof blood are seen to endeavour to pass, and to return again and again,\r\nbefore they become absorbed by the mouths of the veins; which returning of\r\nthese globules evinces, that the arterial force behind them has ceased. The\r\nveins are furnished with valves like the lymphatic absorbents; and the\r\ngreat trunks of the veins, and of the lacteals and lymphatics, join\r\ntogether before the ingress of their fluids into the left chamber of the\r\nheart; both which evince, that the blood in the veins, and the lymph and\r\nchyle in the lacteals and lymphatics, are carried on by a similar force;\r\notherwise the stream, which was propelled with a less power, could not\r\nenter the vessels, which contained the stream propelled with a greater\r\npower. From whence it appears, that the veins are a system of vessels\r\nabsorbing blood, as the lacteals and lymphatics are a system of vessels\r\nabsorbing chyle and lymph. See Sect. XXVII. 1.\r\n\r\nVI. The movements of their adapted fluids in the various vessels of the\r\nbody are carried forwards by the actions of those vessels in consequence of\r\ntwo kinds of stimulus, one of which may be compared to a pleasurable\r\nsensation or desire inducing the vessel to seize, and, as it were, to\r\nswallow the particles thus selected from the blood; as is done by the\r\nmouths of the various glands, veins, and other absorbents, which may be\r\ncalled glandular appetency. The other kind of stimulus may be compared to\r\ndisagreeable sensation, or aversion, as when the heart has received the\r\nblood, and is stimulated by it to push it forwards into the arteries; the\r\nsame again stimulates the arteries to contract, and carry forwards the\r\nblood to their extremities, the glands and capillaries. Thus the mesenteric\r\nveins absorb the blood from the intestines by glandular appetency, and\r\ncarry it forward to the vena portarum; which acting as an artery contracts\r\nitself by disagreeable stimulus, and pushes it to its ramified extremities,\r\nthe various glands, which constitute the liver.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, that at the beginning of the formation of these vessels\r\nin the embryon, an agreeable sensation was in reality felt by the glands\r\nduring secretion, as is now felt in the act of swallowing palatable food;\r\nand that a disagreeable sensation was originally felt by the heart from the\r\ndistention occasioned by the blood, or by its chemical stimulus; but that\r\nby habit these are all become irritative motions; that is, such motions as\r\ndo not affect the whole system, except when the vessels are diseased by\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE SECRETIONS OF SALIVA, AND OF TEARS, AND OF THE LACRYMAL SACK.\r\n\r\n    I. _Secretion of saliva increased by mercury in the blood._ 1. _By the\r\n    food in the mouth. Dryness of the mouth not from a deficiency of\r\n    saliva._ 2. _By Sensitive ideas._ 3. _By volition._ 4. _By distasteful\r\n    substances. It is secreted in a dilute and saline state. It then\r\n    becomes more viscid._ 5. _By ideas of distasteful substances._ 6. _By\r\n    nausea._ 7. _By aversion._ 8. _By catenation with stimulating\r\n    substances in the ear._ II. 1. _Secretion of tears less in sleep. From\r\n    stimulation of their excretory duct._ 2. _Lacrymal sack is a gland._ 3.\r\n    _Its uses._ 4. _Tears are secreted, when the nasal duct is stimulated._\r\n    5. _Or when it is excited by sensation._ 6. _Or by volition._ 7. _The\r\n    lacrymal sack can regurgitate its contents into the eye._ 8. _More\r\n    tears are secreted by association with the irritation of the nasal duct\r\n    of the lacrymal sack, than the puncta lacrymalia can imbibe. Of the\r\n    gout in the liver and stomach._\r\n\r\nI. The salival glands drink up a certain fluid from the circumfluent blood,\r\nand pour it into the mouth. They are sometimes stimulated into action by\r\nthe blood, that surrounds their origin, or by some part of that\r\nheterogeneous fluid: for when mercurial salts, or oxydes, are mixed with\r\nthe blood, they stimulate these glands into unnatural exertions; and then\r\nan unusual quantity of saliva is separated.\r\n\r\n1. As the saliva secreted by these glands is most wanted during the\r\nmastication of our food, it happens, when the terminations of their ducts\r\nin the mouth are stimulated into action, the salival glands themselves are\r\nbrought into increased action at the same time by association, and separate\r\na greater quantity of their juices from the blood; in the same manner as\r\ntears are produced in greater abundance during the stimulus of the vapour\r\nof onions, or of any other acrid material in the eye.\r\n\r\nThe saliva is thus naturally poured into the mouth only during the stimulus\r\nof our food in mastication; for when there is too great an exhalation of\r\nthe mucilaginous secretion from the membranes, which line the mouth, or too\r\ngreat an absorption of it, the mouth becomes dry, though there is no\r\ndeficiency in the quantity of saliva; as in those who sleep with their\r\nmouths open, and in some fevers.\r\n\r\n2. Though during the mastication of our natural food the salival glands are\r\nexcited into action by the stimulus on their excretory ducts, and a due\r\nquantity of saliva is separated from the blood, and poured into the mouth;\r\nyet as this mastication of our food is always attended with a degree of\r\npleasure; and that pleasurable sensation is also connected with our ideas\r\nof certain kinds of aliment; it follows, that when these ideas are\r\nreproduced, the pleasurable sensation arises along with them, and the\r\nsalival glands are excited into action, and fill the mouth with saliva from\r\nthis sensitive association, as is frequently seen in dogs, who slaver at\r\nthe sight of food.\r\n\r\n3. We have also a voluntary power over the action of these salival glands,\r\nfor we can at any time produce a flow of saliva into our mouth, and spit\r\nout, or swallow it at will.\r\n\r\n4. If any very acrid material be held in the mouth, as the root of\r\npyrethrum, or the leaves of tobacco, the salival glands are stimulated into\r\nstronger action than is natural, and thence secrete a much larger quantity\r\nof saliva; which is at the same time more viscid than in its natural state;\r\nbecause the lymphatics, that open their mouths into the ducts of the\r\nsalival glands, and on the membranes, which line the mouth, are likewise\r\nstimulated into stronger action, and absorb the more liquid parts of the\r\nsaliva with greater avidity; and the remainder is left both in greater\r\nquantity and more viscid.\r\n\r\nThe increased absorption in the mouth by some stimulating substances, which\r\nare called astringents, as crab juice, is evident from the instant dryness\r\nproduced in the mouth by a small quantity of them.\r\n\r\nAs the extremities of the glands are of exquisite tenuity, as appears by\r\ntheir difficulty of injection, it was necessary for them to secrete their\r\nfluids in a very dilute state; and, probably for the purpose of stimulating\r\nthem into action, a quantity of neutral salt is likewise secreted or formed\r\nby the gland. This aqueous and saline part of all secreted fluids is again\r\nreabsorbed into the habit. More than half of some secreted fluids is thus\r\nimbibed from the reservoirs, into which they are poured; as in the urinary\r\nbladder much more than half of what is secreted by the kidneys becomes\r\nreabsorbed by the lymphatics, which are thickly dispersed around the neck\r\nof the bladder. This seems to be the purpose of the urinary bladders of\r\nfish, as otherwise such a receptacle for the urine could have been of no\r\nuse to an animal immersed in water.\r\n\r\n5. The idea of substances disagreeably acrid will also produce a quantity\r\nof saliva in the mouth; as when we smell very putrid vapours, we are\r\ninduced to spit out our saliva, as if something disagreeable was actually\r\nupon our palates.\r\n\r\n6. When disagreeable food in the stomach produces nausea, a flow of saliva\r\nis excited in the mouth by association; as efforts to vomit are frequently\r\nproduced by disagreeable drugs in the mouth by the same kind of\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n7. A preternatural flow of saliva is likewise sometimes occasioned by a\r\ndisease of the voluntary power; for if we think about our saliva, and\r\ndetermine not to swallow it, or not to spit it out, an exertion is produced\r\nby the will, and more saliva is secreted against our wish; that is, by our\r\naversion, which bears the same analogy to desire, as pain does to pleasure;\r\nas they are only modifications of the same disposition of the sensorium.\r\nSee Class IV. 3. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n8. The quantity of saliva may also be increased beyond what is natural, by\r\nthe catenation of the motions of these glands with other motions, or\r\nsensations, as by an extraneous body in the ear; of which I have known an\r\ninstance; or by the application of stizolobium, siliqua hirsuta, cowhage,\r\nto the seat of the parotis, as some writers have affirmed.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The lacrymal gland drinks up a certain fluid from the circumfluent\r\nblood, and pours it on the ball of the eye, on the upper part of the\r\nexternal corner of the eyelids. Though it may perhaps be stimulated into\r\nthe performance of its natural action by the blood, which surrounds its\r\norigin, or by some part of that heterogeneous fluid; yet as the tears\r\nsecreted by this gland are more wanted at some times than at others, its\r\nsecretion is variable, like that of the saliva above mentioned, and is\r\nchiefly produced when its excretory duct is stimulated; for in our common\r\nsleep there seems to be little or no secretion of tears; though they are\r\noccasionally produced by our sensations in dreams.\r\n\r\nThus when any extraneous material on the eye-ball, or the dryness of the\r\nexternal covering of it, or the coldness of the air, or the acrimony of\r\nsome vapours, as of onions, stimulates the excretory duct of the lacrymal\r\ngland, it discharges its contents upon the ball; a quicker secretion takes\r\nplace in the gland, and abundant tears succeed, to moisten, clean, and\r\nlubricate the eye. These by frequent nictitation are diffused over the\r\nwhole ball, and as the external angle of the eye in winking is closed\r\nsooner than the internal angle, the tears are gradually driven forwards,\r\nand downwards from the lacrymal gland to the puncta lacrymalia.\r\n\r\n2. The lacrymal sack, with its puncta lacrymalia, and its nasal duct, is a\r\ncomplete gland; and is singular in this respect, that it neither derives\r\nits fluid from, nor disgorges it into the circulation. The simplicity of\r\nthe structure of this gland, and both the extremities of it being on the\r\nsurface of the body, makes it well worthy our minuter observation; as the\r\nactions of more intricate and concealed glands may be better understood\r\nfrom their analogy to this.\r\n\r\n3. This simple gland consists of two absorbing mouths, a belly, and an\r\nexcretory duct. As the tears are brought to the internal angle of the eye,\r\nthese two mouths drink them up, being stimulated into action by this fluid,\r\nwhich they absorb. The belly of the gland, or lacrymal sack, is thus\r\nfilled, in which the saline part of the tears is absorbed, and when the\r\nother end of the gland, or nasal duct, is stimulated by the dryness, or\r\npained by the coldness of the air, or affected by any acrimonious dust or\r\nvapour in the nostrils, it is excited into action together with the sack,\r\nand the tears are disgorged upon the membrane, which lines the nostrils;\r\nwhere they serve a second purpose to moisten, clean, and lubricate, the\r\norgan of smell.\r\n\r\n4. When the nasal duct of this gland is stimulated by any very acrid\r\nmaterial, as the powder of tobacco, or volatile spirits, it not only\r\ndisgorges the contents of its belly or receptacle (the lacrymal sack), and\r\nabsorbs hastily all the fluid, that is ready for it in the corner of the\r\neye; but by the association of its motions with those of the lacrymal\r\ngland, it excites that also into increased action, and a large flow of\r\ntears is poured into the eye.\r\n\r\n5. This nasal duct is likewise excited into strong action by sensitive\r\nideas, as in grief, or joy, and then also by its associations with the\r\nlacrymal gland it produces a great flow of tears without any external\r\nstimulus; as is more fully explained in Sect. XVI. 8. on Instinct.\r\n\r\n6. There are some, famous in the arts of exciting compassion, who are said\r\nto have acquired a voluntary power of producing a flow of tears in the eye;\r\nwhich, from what has been said in the section on Instinct above mentioned,\r\nI should suspect, is performed by acquiring a voluntary power over the\r\naction of this nasal duct.\r\n\r\n7. There is another circumstance well worthy our attention, that when by\r\nany accident this nasal duct is obstructed, the lacrymal sack, which is the\r\nbelly or receptacle of this gland, by slight pressure of the finger is\r\nenabled to disgorge its contents again into the eye; perhaps the bile in\r\nthe same manner, when the biliary ducts are obstructed, is returned into\r\nthe blood by the vessels which secrete it?\r\n\r\n8. A very important though minute occurrence must here be observed, that\r\nthough the lacrymal gland is only excited into action, when we weep at a\r\ndistressful tale, by its association with this nasal duct, as is more fully\r\nexplained in Sect. XVI. 8; yet the quantity of tears secreted at once is\r\nmore than the puncta lacrymalia can readily absorb; which shews _that the\r\nmotions occasioned by associations are frequently more energetic than the\r\noriginal motions, by which they were occasioned_. Which we shall have\r\noccasion to mention hereafter, to illustrate, why pains frequently exist in\r\na part distant from the cause of them, as in the other end of the urethra,\r\nwhen a stone stimulates the neck of the bladder. And why inflammations\r\nfrequently arise in parts distant from their cause, as the gutta rosea of\r\ndrinking people, from an inflamed liver.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation of a part is generally preceded by a torpor or quiescence\r\nof it; if this exists in any large congeries of glands, as in the liver, or\r\nany membranous part, as the stomach, pain is produced and chilliness in\r\nconsequence of the torpor of the vessels. In this situation sometimes an\r\ninflammation of the parts succeeds the torpor; at other times a distant\r\nmore sensible part becomes inflamed; whose actions have previously been\r\nassociated with it; and the torpor of the first part ceases. This I\r\napprehend happens, when the gout of the foot succeeds a pain of the biliary\r\nduct, or of the stomach. Lastly, it sometimes happens, that the pain of\r\ntorpor exists without any consequent inflammation of the affected part, or\r\nof any distant part associated with it, as in the membranes about the\r\ntemple and eye-brows in hemicrania, and in those pains, which occasion\r\nconvulsions; if this happens to gouty people, when it affects the liver, I\r\nsuppose epileptic fits are produced; and, when it affects the stomach,\r\ndeath is the consequence. In these cases the pulse is weak, and the\r\nextremities cold, and such medicines as stimulate the quiescent parts into\r\naction, or which induce inflammation in them, or in any distant part, which\r\nis associated with them, cures the present pain of torpor, and saves the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nI have twice seen a gouty inflammation of the liver, attended with\r\njaundice; the patients after a few days were both of them affected with\r\ncold fits, like ague-fits, and their feet became affected with gout, and\r\nthe inflammation of their livers ceased. It is probable, that the uneasy\r\nsensations about the stomach, and indigestion, which precedes gouty\r\nparoxysms, are generally owing to torpor or slight inflammation of the\r\nliver, and biliary ducts; but where great pain with continued sickness,\r\nwith feeble pulse, and sensation of cold, affect the stomach in patients\r\ndebilitated by the gout, that it is a torpor of the stomach itself, and\r\ndestroys the patient from the great connexion of that viscus with the vital\r\norgans.

From gout of the\r\n    stomach._\r\n\r\n1. The throat, stomach, and intestines, may be considered as one great\r\ngland; which like the lacrymal sack above mentioned, neither begins nor\r\nends in the circulation. Though the act of masticating our aliment belongs\r\nto the sensitive class of motions, for the pleasure of its taste induces\r\nthe muscles of the jaw into action; yet the deglutition of it when\r\nmasticated is generally, if not always, an irritative motion, occasioned by\r\nthe application of the food already masticated to the origin of the\r\npharinx; in the same manner as we often swallow our spittle without\r\nattending to it.\r\n\r\nThe ruminating class of animals have the power to invert the motion of\r\ntheir gullet, and of their first stomach, from the stimulus of this\r\naliment, when it is a little further prepared; as is their daily practice\r\nin chewing the cud; and appears to the eye of any one, who attends to them,\r\nwhilst they are employed in this second mastication of their food.\r\n\r\n2. When our natural aliment arrives into the stomach, this organ is\r\nsimulated into its proper vermicular action; which beginning at the upper\r\norifice of it, and terminating at the lower one, gradually mixes together\r\nand pushes forwards the digesting materials into the intestine beneath it.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the glands, that supply the gastric juices, which are\r\nnecessary to promote the chemical part of the process of digestion, are\r\nstimulated to discharge their contained fluids, and to separate a further\r\nsupply from the blood-vessels: and the lacteals or lymphatics, which open\r\ntheir mouths into the stomach, are stimulated into action, and take up some\r\npart of the digesting materials.\r\n\r\n3. The remainder of these digesting materials is carried forwards into the\r\nupper intestines, and stimulates them into their peristaltic motion similar\r\nto that of the stomach; which continues gradually to mix the changing\r\nmaterials, and pass them along through the valve of the colon to the\r\nexcretory end of this great gland, the sphincter ani.\r\n\r\nThe digesting materials produce a flow of bile, and of pancreatic juice, as\r\nthey pass along the duodenum, by stimulating the excretory ducts of the\r\nliver and pancreas, which terminate in that intestine: and other branches\r\nof the absorbent or lymphatic system, called lacteals, are excited to drink\r\nup, as it passes, those parts of the digesting materials, that are proper\r\nfor their purpose, by its stimulus on their mouths.\r\n\r\n4. When the stomach and intestines are thus filled with their proper food,\r\nnot only the motions of the gastric glands, the pancreas, liver, and\r\nlacteal vessels, are excited into action; but at the same time the whole\r\ntribe of irritative motions are exerted with greater energy, a greater\r\ndegree of warmth, colour, plumpness, and moisture, is given to the skin\r\nfrom the increased action of those glands called capillary vessels;\r\npleasurable sensation is excited, the voluntary motions are less easily\r\nexerted, and at length suspended; and sleep succeeds, unless it be\r\nprevented by the stimulus of surrounding objects, or by voluntary exertion,\r\nor by an acquired habit, which was originally produced by one or other of\r\nthese circumstances, as is explained in Sect. XXI. on Drunkenness.\r\n\r\nAt this time also, as the blood-vessels become replete with chyle, more\r\nurine is separated into the bladder, and less of it is reabsorbed; more\r\nmucus poured into the cellular membranes, and less of it reabsorbed; the\r\npulse becomes fuller, and softer, and in general quicker. The reason why\r\nless urine and cellular mucus is absorbed after a full meal with sufficient\r\ndrink is owing to the blood-vessels being fuller: hence one means to\r\npromote absorption is to decrease the resistance by emptying the vessels by\r\nvenesection. From this decreased absorption the urine becomes pale as well\r\nas copious, and the skin appears plump as well as florid.\r\n\r\nBy daily repetition of these movements they all become connected together,\r\nand make a diurnal circle of irritative action, and if one of this chain be\r\ndisturbed, the whole is liable to be put into disorder. See Sect. XX. on\r\nVertigo.\r\n\r\n5. When the stomach and intestines receive a quantity of food, whose\r\nstimulus is greater than usual, all their motions, and those of the glands\r\nand lymphatics, are stimulated into stronger action than usual, and perform\r\ntheir offices with greater vigour and in less time: such are the effects of\r\ncertain quantities of spice or of vinous spirit.\r\n\r\n6. But if the quantity or duration of these stimuli are still further\r\nincreased, the stomach and throat are stimulated into a motion, whose\r\ndirection is contrary to the natural one above described; and they\r\nregurgitate the materials, which they contain, instead of carrying them\r\nforwards. This retrograde motion of the stomach may be compared to the\r\nstretchings of wearied limbs the contrary way, and is well elucidated by\r\nthe following experiment. Look earnestly for a minute or two on an area an\r\ninch square of pink silk, placed in a strong light, the eye becomes\r\nfatigued, the colour becomes faint, and at length vanishes, for the\r\nfatigued eye can no longer be stimulated into direct motions; then on\r\nclosing the eye a green spectrum will appear in it, which is a colour\r\ndirectly contrary to pink, and which will appear and disappear repeatedly,\r\nlike the efforts in vomiting. See Section XXIX. 11.\r\n\r\nHence all those drugs, which by their bitter or astringent stimulus\r\nincrease the action of the stomach, as camomile and white vitriol, if their\r\nquantity is increased above a certain dose become emetics.\r\n\r\nThese inverted motions of the stomach and throat are generally produced\r\nfrom the stimulus of unnatural food, and are attended with the sensation of\r\nnausea or sickness: but as this sensation is again connected with an idea\r\nof the distasteful food, which induced it; so an idea of nauseous food will\r\nalso sometimes excite the action of nausea; and that give rise by\r\nassociation to the inversion of the motions of the stomach and throat. As\r\nsome, who have had horse-flesh or dogs-flesh given them for beef or mutton,\r\nare said to have vomited many hours afterwards, when they have been told of\r\nthe imposition.\r\n\r\nI have been told of a person, who had gained a voluntary command over these\r\ninverted motions of the stomach and throat, and supported himself by\r\nexhibiting this curiosity to the public. At these exhibitions he swallowed\r\na pint of red rough gooseberries, and a pint of white smooth ones, brought\r\nthem up in small parcels into his mouth, and restored them separately to\r\nthe spectators, who called for red or white as they pleased, till the whole\r\nwere redelivered.\r\n\r\n7. At the same time that these motions of the stomach and throat are\r\nstimulated into inversion, some of the other irritative motions, that had\r\nacquired more immediate connexions with the stomach, as those of the\r\ngastric glands, are excited into stronger action by this association; and\r\nsome other of these motions, which are more easily excited, as those of the\r\ngastric lymphatics, are inverted by their association with the retrograde\r\nmotions of the stomach, and regurgitate their contents, and thus a greater\r\nquantity of mucus, and of lymph, or chyle, is poured into the stomach, and\r\nthrown up along with its contents.\r\n\r\n8. These inversions of the motion of the stomach in vomiting are performed\r\nby intervals, for the same reason that many other motions are reciprocally\r\nexerted and relaxed; for during the time of exertion the stimulus, or\r\nsensation, which caused this exertion, is not perceived; but begins to be\r\nperceived again, as soon as the exertion ceases, and is some time in again\r\nproducing its effect. As explained in Sect. XXXIV. on Volition, where it is\r\nshewn, that the contractions of the fibres, and the sensation of pain,\r\nwhich occasioned that exertion, cannot exist at the same time. The exertion\r\nceases from another cause also, which is the exhaustion of the sensorial\r\npower of the part, and these two causes frequently operate together.\r\n\r\n9. At the times of these inverted efforts of the stomach not only the\r\nlymphatics, which open their mouths into the stomach, but those of the skin\r\nalso, are for a time inverted; for sweats are sometimes pushed out during\r\nthe efforts of vomiting without an increase of heat.\r\n\r\n10. But if by a greater stimulus the motions of the stomach are inverted\r\nstill more violently or more permanently, the duodenum has its peristaltic\r\nmotions inverted at the same time by their association with those of the\r\nstomach; and the bile and pancreatic juice, which it contains, are by the\r\ninverted motions brought up into the stomach, and discharged along with its\r\ncontents; while a greater quantity of bile and pancreatic juice is poured\r\ninto this intestine; as the glands, that secrete them, are by their\r\nassociation with the motions of the intestine excited into stronger action\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\n11. The other intestines are by association excited into more powerful\r\naction, while the lymphatics, that open their mouths into them, suffer an\r\ninversion of their motions corresponding with the lymphatics of the\r\nstomach, and duodenum; which with a part of the abundant secretion of bile\r\nis carried downwards, and contributes both to stimulate the bowels, and to\r\nincrease the quantity of the evacuations. This inversion of the motion of\r\nthe lymphatics appears from the quantity of chyle, which comes away by\r\nstools; which is otherwise absorbed as soon as produced, and by the immense\r\nquantity of thin fluid, which is evacuated along with it.\r\n\r\n12. But if the stimulus, which inverts the stomach, be still more powerful,\r\nor more permanent, it sometimes happens, that the motions of the biliary\r\nglands, and of their excretory ducts, are at the same time inverted, and\r\nregurgitate their contained bile into the blood-vessels, as appears by the\r\nyellow colour of the skin, and of the urine; and it is probable the\r\npancreatic secretion may suffer an inversion at the same time, though we\r\nhave yet no mark by which this can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n13. Mr. ---- eat two putrid pigeons out of a cold pigeon-pye, and drank\r\nabout a pint of beer and ale along with them, and immediately rode about\r\nfive miles. He was then seized with vomiting, which was after a few periods\r\nsucceeded by purging; these continued alternately for two hours; and the\r\npurging continued by intervals for six or eight hours longer. During this\r\ntime he could not force himself to drink more than one pint in the whole;\r\nthis great inability to drink was owing to the nausea, or inverted motions\r\nof the stomach, which the voluntary exertion of swallowing could seldom and\r\nwith difficulty overcome; yet he discharged in the whole at least six\r\nquarts; whence came this quantity of liquid? First, the contents of the\r\nstomach were emitted, then of the duodenum, gall-bladder, and pancreas, by\r\nvomiting. After this the contents of the lower bowels, then the chyle, that\r\nwas in the lacteal vessels, and in the receptacle of chyle, was\r\nregurgitated into the intestines by a retrograde motion of these vessels.\r\nAnd afterwards the mucus deposited in the cellular membrane, and on the\r\nsurface of all the other membranes, seems to have been absorbed; and with\r\nthe fluid absorbed from the air to have been carried up their respective\r\nlymphatic branches by the increased energy of their natural motions, and\r\ndown the visceral lymphatics, or lacteals, by the inversion of their\r\nmotions.\r\n\r\n14. It may be difficult to invent experiments to demonstrate the truth of\r\nthis inversion of some branches of the absorbent system, and increased\r\nabsorption of others, but the analogy of these vessels to the intestinal\r\ncanal, and the symptoms of many diseases, render this opinion more probable\r\nthan many other received opinions of the animal oeconomy.\r\n\r\nIn the above instance, after the yellow excrement was voided, the fluid\r\nceased to have any smell, and appeared like curdled milk, and then a\r\nthinner fluid, and some mucus, were evacuated; did not these seem to\r\npartake of the chyle, of the mucous fluid from all the cells of the body,\r\nand lastly, of the atmospheric moisture? All these facts may be easily\r\nobserved by any one, who takes a brisk purge.\r\n\r\n15. Where the stimulus on the stomach, or on some other part of the\r\nintestinal canal, is still more permanent, not only the lacteal vessels,\r\nbut the whole canal itself, becomes inverted from its associations: this is\r\nthe iliac passion, in which all the fluids mentioned above are thrown up by\r\nthe mouth. At this time the valve in the colon, from the inverted motions\r\nof that bowel, and the inverted action of this living valve, does not\r\nprevent the regurgitation of its contents.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this valve may be represented by a flexile leathern pipe\r\nstanding up from the bottom of a vessel of water: its sides collapse by the\r\npressure of the ambient fluid, as a small part of that fluid passes through\r\nit; but if it has a living power, and by its inverted action keeps itself\r\nopen, it becomes like a rigid pipe, and will admit the whole liquid to\r\npass. See Sect. XXIX. 2. 5.\r\n\r\nIn this case the patient is averse to drink, from the constant inversion of\r\nthe motions of the stomach, and yet many quarts are daily ejected from the\r\nstomach, which at length smell of excrement, and at last seem to be only a\r\nthin mucilaginous or aqueous liquor.\r\n\r\nFrom whence is it possible, that this great quantity of fluid for many\r\nsuccessive days can be supplied, after the cells of the body have given up\r\ntheir fluids, but from the atmosphere? When the cutaneous branch of\r\nabsorbents acts with unnatural strength, it is probable the intestinal\r\nbranch has its motions inverted, and thus a fluid is supplied without\r\nentering the arterial system. Could oiling or painting the skin give a\r\ncheck to this disease?\r\n\r\nSo when the stomach has its motions inverted, the lymphatics of the\r\nstomach, which are most strictly associated with it, invert their motions\r\nat the same time. But the more distant branches of lymphatics, which are\r\nless strictly associated with it, act with increased energy; as the\r\ncutaneous lymphatics in the cholera, or iliac passion, above described. And\r\nother irritative motions become decreased, as the pulsations of the\r\narteries, from the extra-derivation or exhaustion of the sensorial power.\r\n\r\nSometimes when stronger vomiting takes place the more distant branches of\r\nthe lymphatic system invert their motions with those of the stomach, and\r\nloose stools are produced, and cold sweats.\r\n\r\nSo when the lacteals have their motions inverted, as during the operation\r\nof strong purges, the urinary and cutaneous absorbents have their motions\r\nincreased to supply the want of fluid in the blood, as in great thirst; but\r\nafter a meal with sufficient potation the urine is pale, that is, the\r\nurinary absorbents act weakly, no supply of water being wanted for the\r\nblood. And when the intestinal absorbents act too violently, as when too\r\ngreat quantities of fluid have been drank, the urinary absorbents invert\r\ntheir motions to carry off the superfluity, which is a new circumstance of\r\nassociation, and a temporary diabetes supervenes.\r\n\r\n16. I have had the opportunity of seeing four patients in the iliac\r\npassion, where the ejected material smelled and looked like excrement. Two\r\nof these were so exhausted at the time I saw them, that more blood could\r\nnot be taken from them, and as their pain had ceased, and they continued to\r\nvomit up every thing which they drank, I suspected that a mortification of\r\nthe bowel had already taken place, and as they were both women advanced in\r\nlife, and a mortification is produced with less preceding pain in old and\r\nweak people, these both died. The other two, who were both young men, had\r\nstill pain and strength sufficient for further venesection, and they\r\nneither of them had any appearance of hernia, both recovered by repeated\r\nbleeding, and a scruple of calomel given to one, and half a dram to the\r\nother, in very small pills: the usual means of clysters, and purges joined\r\nwith opiates, had been in vain attempted. I have thought an ounce or two of\r\ncrude mercury in less violent diseases of this kind has been of use, by\r\ncontributing to restore its natural motion to some part of the intestinal\r\ncanal, either by its weight or stimulus; and that hence the whole tube\r\nrecovered its usual associations of progressive peristaltic motion. I have\r\nin three cases seen crude mercury given in small doses, as one or two\r\nounces twice a day, have great effect in stopping pertinacious vomitings.\r\n\r\n17. Besides the affections above described, the stomach is liable, like\r\nmany other membranes of the body, to torpor without consequent\r\ninflammation: as happens to the membranes about the head in some cases of\r\nhemicrania, or in general head-ach. This torpor of the stomach is attended\r\nwith indigestion, and consequent flatulency, and with pain, which is\r\nusually called the cramp of the stomach, and is relievable by aromatics,\r\nessential oils, alcohol, or opium.\r\n\r\nThe intrusion of a gall-stone into the common bile-duct from the\r\ngall-bladder is sometimes mistaken for a pain of the stomach, as neither of\r\nthem are attended with fever; but in the passage of a gall-stone, the pain\r\nis confined to a less space, which is exactly where the common bile-duct\r\nenters the duodenum, as explained in Section XXX. 1. 3. Whereas in this\r\ngastrodynia the pain is diffused over the whole stomach; and, like other\r\ndiseases from torpor, the pulse is weaker, and the extremities colder, and\r\nthe general debility greater, than in the passage of a gall-stone; for in\r\nthe former the debility is the consequence of the pain, in the latter it is\r\nthe cause of it.\r\n\r\nThough the first fits of the gout, I believe, commence with a torpor of the\r\nliver; and the ball of the toe becomes inflamed instead of the membranes of\r\nthe liver in consequence of this torpor, as a coryza or catarrh frequently\r\nsucceeds a long exposure of the feet to cold, as in snow, or on a moist\r\nbrick-floor; yet in old or exhausted constitutions, which have been long\r\nhabituated to its attacks, it sometimes commences with a torpor of the\r\nstomach, and is transferable to every membrane of the body. When the gout\r\nbegins with torpor of the stomach, a painful sensation of cold occurs,\r\nwhich the patient compares to ice, with weak pulse, cold extremities, and\r\nsickness; this in its slighter degree is relievable by spice, wine, or\r\nopium; in its greater degree it is succeeded by sudden death, which is\r\nowing to the sympathy of the stomach with the heart, as explained below.\r\n\r\nIf the stomach becomes inflamed in consequence of this gouty torpor of it,\r\nor in consequence of its sympathy with some other part, the danger is less.\r\nA sickness and vomiting continues many days, or even weeks, the stomach\r\nrejecting every thing stimulant, even opium or alcohol, together with much\r\nviscid mucus; till the inflammation at length ceases, as happens when other\r\nmembranes, as those of the joints, are the seat of gouty inflammation; as\r\nobserved in Sect. XXIV. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nThe sympathy, or association of motions, between those of the stomach and\r\nthose of the heart, are evinced in many diseases. First, many people are\r\noccasionally affected with an intermission of their pulse for a few days,\r\nwhich then ceases again. In this case there is a stop of the motion of the\r\nheart, and at the same time a tendency to eructation from the stomach. As\r\nsoon as the patient feels a tendency to the intermission of the motion of\r\nhis heart, if he voluntarily brings up wind from his stomach, the stop of\r\nthe heart does not occur. From hence I conclude that the stop of digestion\r\nis the primary disease; and that air is instantly generated from the\r\naliment, which begins to ferment, if the digestive process is impeded for a\r\nmoment, (see Sect. XXIII. 4.); and that the stop of the heart is in\r\nconsequence of the association of the motions of these viscera, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XXXV. 1. 4.; but if the little air, which is instantly\r\ngenerated during the temporary torpor of the stomach, be evacuated, the\r\ndigestion recommences, and the temporary torpor of the heart does not\r\nfollow. One patient, whom I lately saw, and who had been five or six days\r\nmuch troubled with this intermission of a pulsation of his heart, and who\r\nhad hemicrania with some fever, was immediately relieved from them all by\r\nlosing ten ounces of blood, which had what is termed an inflammatory crust\r\non it.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of this association between the motions of the stomach and\r\nheart is evinced by the exhibition of an over dose of foxglove, which\r\ninduces an incessant vomiting, which is attended with very slow, and\r\nsometimes intermitting pulse.--Which continues in spite of the exhibition\r\nof wine and opium for two or three days. To the same association must be\r\nascribed the weak pulse, which constantly attends the exhibition of emetics\r\nduring their operation. And also the sudden deaths, which have been\r\noccasioned in boxing by a blow on the stomach; and lastly, the sudden death\r\nof those, who have been long debilitated by the gout, from the torpor of\r\nthe stomach.

The capillary-vessels are like all the other glands except the\r\nabsorbent system, inasmuch as they receive blood from the arteries,\r\nseparate a fluid from it, and return the remainder by the veins.\r\n\r\n2. This series of glands is of the most extensive use, as their excretory\r\nducts open on the whole external skin forming its perspirative pores, and\r\non the internal surfaces of every cavity of the body. Their secretion on\r\nthe skin is termed insensible perspiration, which in health is in part\r\nreabsorbed by the mouths of the lymphatics, and in part evaporated in the\r\nair; the secretion on the membranes, which line the larger cavities of the\r\nbody, which have external openings, as the mouth and intestinal canal, is\r\ntermed mucus, but is not however coagulable by heat; and the secretion on\r\nthe membranes of those cavities of the body, which have no external\r\nopenings, is called lymph or water, as in the cavities of the cellular\r\nmembrane, and of the abdomen; this lymph however is coagulable by the heat\r\nof boiling water. Some mucus nearly as viscid as the white of egg, which\r\nwas discharged by stool, did not coagulate, though I evaporated it to one\r\nfourth of the quantity, nor did the aqueous and vitreous humours of a\r\nsheep's eye coagulate by the like experiment: but the serosity from an\r\nanasarcous leg, and that from the abdomen of a dropsical person, and the\r\ncrystalline humour of a sheep's eye, coagulated in the same heat.\r\n\r\n3. When any of these capillary glands are stimulated into greater\r\nirritative actions, than is natural, they secrete a more copious material;\r\nand as the mouths of the absorbent system, which open in their vicinity,\r\nare at the same time stimulated into greater action, the thinner and more\r\nsaline part of the secreted fluid is taken up again; and the remainder is\r\nnot only more copious but also more viscid than natural. This is more or\r\nless troublesome or noxious according to the importance of the functions of\r\nthe part affected: on the skin and bronchiæ, where this secretion ought\r\nnaturally to evaporate, it becomes so viscid as to adhere to the membrane;\r\non the tongue it forms a pellicle, which can with difficulty be scraped\r\noff; produces the scurf on the heads of many people; and the mucus, which\r\nis spit up by others in coughing. On the nostrils and fauces, when the\r\nsecretion of these capillary glands is increased, it is termed simple\r\ncatarrh; when in the intestines, a mucous diarrhoea; and in the urethra, or\r\nvagina, it has the name of gonorrhoea, or fluor albus.\r\n\r\n4. When these capillary glands become inflamed, a still more viscid or even\r\ncretaceous humour is produced upon the surfaces of the membranes, which is\r\nthe cause or the effect of rheumatism, gout, leprosy, and of hard tumours\r\nof the legs, which are generally termed scorbutic; all which will be\r\ntreated of hereafter.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The whole surface of the body, with all its cavities and contents,\r\nare covered with membrane. It lines every vessel, forms every cell, and\r\nbinds together all the muscular and perhaps the osseous fibres of the body;\r\nand is itself therefore probably a simpler substance than those fibres. And\r\nas the containing vessels of the body from the largest to the least are\r\nthus lined and connected with membranes, it follows that these membranes\r\nthemselves consisted of unorganized materials.\r\n\r\nFor however small we may conceive the diameters of the minutest vessels of\r\nthe body, which escape our eyes and glasses, yet these vessels must consist\r\nof coats or sides, which are made up of an unorganized material, and which\r\nare probably produced from a gluten, which hardens after its production,\r\nlike the silk or web of caterpillars and spiders. Of this material consist\r\nthe membranes, which line the shells of eggs, and the shell itself, both\r\nwhich are unorganized, and are formed from mucus, which hardens after it is\r\nformed, either by the absorption of its more fluid part, or by its uniting\r\nwith some part of the atmosphere. Such is also the production of the shells\r\nof snails, and of shell-fish, and I suppose of the enamel of the teeth.\r\n\r\n2. But though the membranes, that compose the sides of the most minute\r\nvessels, are in truth unorganized materials, yet the larger membranes,\r\nwhich are perceptible to the eye, seem to be composed of an intertexture of\r\nthe mouths of the absorbent system, and of the excretory ducts of the\r\ncapillaries, with their concomitant arteries, veins, and nerves: and from\r\nthis construction it is evident, that these membranes must possess great\r\nirritability to peculiar stimuli, though they are incapable of any motions,\r\nthat are visible to the naked eye: and daily experience shews us, that in\r\ntheir inflamed state they have the greatest sensibility to pain, as in the\r\npleurisy and paronychia.\r\n\r\n3. On all these membranes a mucilaginous or aqueous fluid is secreted,\r\nwhich moistens and lubricates their surfaces, as was explained in Section\r\nXXIII. 2. Some have doubted, whether this mucus is separated from the blood\r\nby an appropriated set of glands, or exudes through the membranes, or is an\r\nabrasion or destruction of the surface of the membrane itself, which is\r\ncontinually repaired on the other side of it, but the great analogy between\r\nthe capillary vessels, and the other glands, countenances the former\r\nopinion; and evinces, that these capillaries are the glands, that secrete\r\nit; to which we must add, that the blood in passing these capillary vessels\r\nundergoes a change in its colour from florid to purple, and gives out a\r\nquantity of heat; from whence, as in other glands, we must conclude that\r\nsomething is secreted from it.\r\n\r\nIII. The seat of rheumatism is in the membranes, or upon them; but there\r\nare three very distinct diseases, which commonly are confounded under this\r\nname. First, when a membrane becomes affected with torpor, or inactivity of\r\nthe vessels which compose it, pain and coldness succeed, as in the\r\nhemicrania, and other head-achs, which are generally termed nervous\r\nrheumatism; they exist whether the part be at rest or in motion, and are\r\ngenerally attended with other marks of debility.\r\n\r\nAnother rheumatism is said to exist, when inflammation and swelling, as\r\nwell as pain, affect some of the membranes of the joints, as of the ancles,\r\nwrists, knees, elbows, and sometimes of the ribs. This is accompanied with\r\nfever, is analogous to pleurisy and other inflammations, and is termed the\r\nacute rheumatism.\r\n\r\nA third disease is called chronic rheumatism, which is distinguished from\r\nthat first mentioned, as in this the pain only affects the patient during\r\nthe motion of the part, and from the second kind of rheumatism above\r\ndescribed, as it is not attended with quick pulse or inflammation. It is\r\ngenerally believed to succeed the acute rheumatism of the same part, and\r\nthat some coagulable lymph, or cretaceous, or calculous material, has been\r\nleft on the membrane; which gives pain, when the muscles move over it, as\r\nsome extraneous body would do, which was too insoluble to be absorbed.\r\nHence there is an analogy between this chronic rheumatism and the diseases\r\nwhich produce gravel or gout-stones; and it may perhaps receive relief from\r\nthe same remedies, such as aerated sal soda.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVII.\r\n\r\nOF HÆMORRHAGES.\r\n\r\n    I. _The veins are absorbent vessels._ 1. _Hæmorrhages from\r\n    inflammation. Case of hæmorrhage from the kidney cured by cold bathing.\r\n    Case of hæmorrhage from the nose cured by cold immersion._ II.\r\n    _Hæmorrhage from venous paralysis. Of Piles. Black stools. Petechiæ.\r\n    Consumption. Scurvy of the lungs. Blackness of the face and eyes in\r\n    epileptic fits. Cure of hæmorrhages from venous inability._\r\n\r\nI. As the imbibing mouths of the absorbent system already described open on\r\nthe surface, and into the larger cavities of the body, so there is another\r\nsystem of absorbent vessels, which are not commonly esteemed such, I mean\r\nthe veins, which take up the blood from the various glands and capillaries,\r\nafter their proper fluids or secretions have been separated from it.\r\n\r\nThe veins resemble the other absorbent vessels; as the progression of their\r\ncontents is carried on in the same manner in both, they alike absorb their\r\nappropriated fluids, and have valves to prevent its regurgitation by the\r\naccidents of mechanical violence. This appears first, because there is no\r\npulsation in the very beginnings of the veins, as is seen by microscopes;\r\nwhich must happen, if the blood was carried into them by the actions of the\r\narteries. For though the concurrence of various venous streams of blood\r\nfrom different distances must prevent any pulsation in the larger branches,\r\nyet in the very beginnings of all these branches a pulsation must\r\nunavoidably exist, if the circulation in them was owing to the intermitted\r\nforce of the arteries. Secondly, the venous absorption of blood from the\r\npenis, and from the teats of female animals after their erection, is still\r\nmore similar to the lymphatic absorption, as it is previously poured into\r\ncells, where all arterial impulse must cease.\r\n\r\nThere is an experiment, which seems to evince this venous absorption, which\r\nconsists in the external application of a stimulus to the lips, as of\r\nvinegar, by which they become instantly pale; that is, the bibulous mouths\r\nof the veins by this stimulus are excited to absorb the blood faster, than\r\nit can be supplied by the usual arterial exertion. See Sect. XXIII. 5.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of hæmorrhages frequent in diseases, one is where the\r\nglandular or capillary action is too powerfully exerted, and propels the\r\nblood forwards more hastily, than the veins can absorb it; and the other\r\nis, where the absorbent power of the veins is diminished, or a branch of\r\nthem is become totally paralytic.\r\n\r\n1. The former of these cases is known by the heat of the part, and the\r\ngeneral fever or inflammation that accompanies the hæmorrhage. An\r\nhæmorrhage from the nose or from the lungs is sometimes a crisis of\r\ninflammatory diseases, as of the hepatitis and gout, and generally ceases\r\nspontaneously, when the vessels are considerably emptied. Sometimes the\r\nhæmorrhage recurs by daily periods accompanying the hot fits of fever, and\r\nceasing in the cold fits, or in the intermissions; this is to be cured by\r\nremoving the febrile paroxysms, which will be treated of in their place.\r\nOtherwise it is cured by venesection, by the internal or external\r\npreparations of lead, or by the application of cold, with an abstemious\r\ndiet, and diluting liquids, like other inflammations. Which by inducing a\r\nquiescence on those glandular parts, that are affected, prevents a greater\r\nquantity of blood from being protruded forwards, than the veins are capable\r\nof absorbing.\r\n\r\nMr. B---- had an hæmorrhage from his kidney, and parted with not less than\r\na pint of blood a day (by conjecture) along with his urine for above a\r\nfortnight: venesections, mucilages, balsams, preparations of lead, the\r\nbark, alum, and dragon's blood, opiates, with a large blister on his loins,\r\nwere separately tried, in large doses, to no purpose. He was then directed\r\nto bathe in a cold spring up to the middle of his body only, the upper part\r\nbeing covered, and the hæmorrhage diminished at the first, and ceased at\r\nthe second immersion.\r\n\r\nIn this case the external capillaries were rendered quiescent by the\r\ncoldness of the water, and thence a less quantity of blood was circulated\r\nthrough them; and the internal capillaries, or other glands, became\r\nquiescent from their irritative associations with the external ones; and\r\nthe hæmorrhage was stopped a sufficient time for the ruptured vessels to\r\ncontract their apertures, or for the blood in those apertures to coagulate.\r\n\r\nMrs. K---- had a continued haemorrhage from her nose for some days; the\r\nruptured vessel was not to be reached by plugs up the nostrils, and the\r\nsensibility of her fauces was such that nothing could be born behind the\r\nuvula. After repeated venesection, and other common applications, she was\r\ndirected to immerse her whole head into a pail of water, which was made\r\ncolder by the addition of several handfuls of salt, and the hæmorrhage\r\nimmediately ceased, and returned no more; but her pulse continued hard, and\r\nshe was necessitated to lose blood from the arm on the succeeding day.\r\n\r\nQuery, might not the cold bath instantly stop hæmorrhages from the lungs in\r\ninflammatory cases?--for the shortness of breath of those, who go suddenly\r\ninto cold water, is not owing to the accumulation of blood in the lungs,\r\nbut to the quiescence of the pulmonary capillaries from association, as\r\nexplained in Section XXXII. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nII. The other kind of hæmorrhage is known from its being attended with a\r\nweak pulse, and other symptoms of general debility, and very frequently\r\noccurs in those, who have diseased livers, owing to intemperance in the use\r\nof fermented liquors. These constitutions are shewn to be liable to\r\nparalysis of the lymphatic absorbents, producing the various kinds of\r\ndropsies in Section XXIX. 5. Now if any branch of the venous system loses\r\nits power of absorption, the part swells, and at length bursts and\r\ndischarges the blood, which the capillaries or other glands circulate\r\nthrough them.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that the large external veins of the legs burst, and\r\neffuse their blood; but this occurs most frequently in the veins of the\r\nintestines, as the vena portarum is liable to suffer from a schirrus of the\r\nliver opposing the progression of the blood, which is absorbed from the\r\nintestines. Hence the piles are a symptom of hepatic obstruction, and hence\r\nthe copious discharges downwards or upwards of a black material, which has\r\nbeen called melancholia, or black bile; but is no other than the blood,\r\nwhich is probably discharged from the veins of the intestines.\r\n\r\nJ.F. Meckel, in his Experimenta de Finibus Vasorum, published at Berlin,\r\n1772, mentions his discovery of a communication of a lymphatic vessel with\r\nthe gastric branch of the vena portarum. It is possible, that when the\r\nmotion of the lymphatic becomes retrograde in some diseases, that blood may\r\nobtain a passage into it, where it anastomoses with the vein, and thus be\r\npoured into the intestines. A discharge of blood with the urine sometimes\r\nattends diabetes, and may have its source in the same manner.\r\n\r\nMr. A----, who had been a hard drinker, and had the gutta rosacea on his\r\nface and breast, after a stroke of the palsy voided near a quart of a black\r\nviscid material by stool: on diluting it with water it did not become\r\nyellow, as it must have done if it had been inspissated bile, but continued\r\nblack like the grounds of coffee.\r\n\r\nBut any other part of the venous system may become quiescent or totally\r\nparalytic as well as the veins of the intestines: all which occur more\r\nfrequently in those who have diseased livers, than in any others. Hence\r\ntroublesome bleedings of the nose, or from the lungs with a weak pulse;\r\nhence hæmorrhages from the kidneys, too great menstruation; and hence the\r\noozing of blood from every part of the body, and the petechiæ in those\r\nfevers, which are termed putrid, and which is erroneously ascribed to the\r\nthinness of the blood: for the blood in inflammatory diseases is equally\r\nfluid before it coagulates in the cold air.\r\n\r\nIs not that hereditary consumption, which occurs chiefly in dark-eyed\r\npeople about the age of twenty, and commences with slight pulmonary\r\nhæmorrhages without fever, a disease of this kind?--These hæmorrhages\r\nfrequently begin during sleep, when the irritability of the lungs is not\r\nsufficient in these patients to carry on the circulation without the\r\nassistance of volition; for in our waking hours, the motions of the lungs\r\nare in part voluntary, especially if any difficulty of breathing renders\r\nthe efforts of volition necessary. See Class I. 2. 1. 3. and Class III. 2.\r\n1. 12. Another species of pulmonary consumption which seems more certainly\r\nof scrophulous origin is described in the next Section, No. 2.\r\n\r\nI have seen two cases of women, of about forty years of age, both of whom\r\nwere seized with quick weak pulse, with difficult respiration, and who spit\r\nup by coughing much viscid mucus mixed with dark coloured blood. They had\r\nboth large vibices on their limbs, and petechiæ; in one the feet were in\r\ndanger of mortification, in the other the legs were oedematous. To relieve\r\nthe difficult respiration, about six ounces of blood were taken from one of\r\nthem, which to my surprise was sizy, like inflamed blood: they had both\r\npalpitations or unequal pulsations of the heart. They continued four or\r\nfive weeks with pale and bloated countenances, and did not cease spitting\r\nphlegm mixed with black blood, and the pulse seldom slower than 130 or 135\r\nin a minute. This blood, from its dark colour, and from the many vibices\r\nand petechiæ, seems to have been venous blood; the quickness of the pulse,\r\nand the irregularity of the motion of the heart, are to be ascribed to\r\ndebility of that part of the system; as the extravasation of blood\r\noriginated from the defect of venous absorption. The approximation of these\r\ntwo cases to sea-scurvy is peculiar, and may allow them to be called\r\nscorbutus pulmonalis. Had these been younger subjects, and the paralysis of\r\nthe veins had only affected the lungs, it is probable the disease would\r\nhave been a pulmonary consumption.\r\n\r\nLast week I saw a gentleman of Birmingham, who had for ten days laboured\r\nunder great palpitation of his heart, which was so distinctly felt by the\r\nhand, as to discountenance the idea of there being a fluid in the\r\npericardium. He frequently spit up mucus stained with dark coloured blood,\r\nhis pulse very unequal and very weak, with cold hands and nose. He could\r\nnot lie down at all, and for about ten days past could not sleep a minute\r\ntogether, but waked perpetually with great uneasiness. Could those symptoms\r\nbe owing to very extensive adhesions of the lungs? or is this a scorbutus\r\npulmonalis? After a few days he suddenly got so much better as to be able\r\nto sleep many hours at a time by the use of one grain of powder of foxglove\r\ntwice a day, and a grain of opium at night. After a few days longer, the\r\nbark was exhibited, and the opium continued with some wine; and the\r\npalpitations of his heart became much relieved, and he recovered his usual\r\ndegree of health, but died suddenly some months afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn epileptic fits the patients frequently become black in the face, from\r\nthe temporary paralysis of the venous system of this part. I have known two\r\ninstances where the blackness has continued many days. M. P----, who had\r\ndrank intemperately, was seized with the epilepsy when he was in his\r\nfortieth year; in one of these fits the white part of his eyes was left\r\ntotally black with effused blood; which was attended with no pain or heat,\r\nand was in a few weeks gradually absorbed, changing colour as is usual with\r\nvibices from bruises.\r\n\r\nThe hæmorrhages produced from the inability of the veins to absorb the\r\nrefluent blood, is cured by opium, the preparations of steel, lead, the\r\nbark, vitriolic acid, and blisters; but these have the effect with much\r\nmore certainty, if a venesection to a few ounces, and a moderate cathartic\r\nwith four or six grains of calomel be premised, where the patient is not\r\nalready too much debilitated; as one great means of promoting the\r\nabsorption of any fluid consists in previously emptying the vessels, which\r\nare to receive it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE PARALYSIS OF THE ABSORBENT SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n    I. _Paralysis of the lacteals, atrophy. Distaste to animal food._ II.\r\n    _Cause of dropsy. Cause of herpes. Scrophula. Mesenteric consumption.\r\n    Pulmonary consumption. Why ulcers in the lungs are so difficult to\r\n    heal._\r\n\r\nThe term paralysis has generally been used to express the loss of voluntary\r\nmotion, as in the hemiplagia, but may with equal propriety be applied to\r\nexpress the disobediency of the muscular fibres to the other kinds of\r\nstimulus; as to those of irritation or sensation.\r\n\r\nI. There is a species of atrophy, which has not been well understood; when\r\nthe absorbent vessels of the stomach and intestines have been long inured\r\nto the stimulus of too much spirituous liquor, they at length, either by\r\nthe too sudden omission of fermented or spirituous potation, or from the\r\ngradual decay of nature, become in a certain degree paralytic; now it is\r\nobserved in the larger muscles of the body, when one side is paralytic, the\r\nother is more frequently in motion, owing to the less expenditure of\r\nsensorial power in the paralytic limbs; so in this case the other part of\r\nthe absorbent system acts with greater force, or with greater perseverance,\r\nin consequence of the paralysis of the lacteals; and the body becomes\r\ngreatly emaciated in a small time.\r\n\r\nI have seen several patients in this disease, of which the following are\r\nthe circumstances. 1. They were men about fifty years of age, and had lived\r\nfreely in respect to fermented liquors. 2. They lost their appetite to\r\nanimal food. 3. They became suddenly emaciated to a great degree. 4. Their\r\nskins were dry and rough. 5. They coughed and expectorated with difficulty\r\na viscid phlegm. 6. The membrane of the tongue was dry and red, and liable\r\nto become ulcerous.\r\n\r\nThe inability to digest animal food, and the consequent distaste to it,\r\ngenerally precedes the dropsy, and other diseases, which originate from\r\nspirituous potation. I suppose when the stomach becomes inirritable, that\r\nthere is at the same time a deficiency of gastric acid; hence milk seldom\r\nagrees with these patients, unless it be previously curdled, as they have\r\nnot sufficient gastric acid to curdle it; and hence vegetable food, which\r\nis itself acescent, will agree with their stomachs longer than animal food,\r\nwhich requires more of the gastric acid for its digestion.\r\n\r\nIn this disease the skin is dry from the increased absorption of the\r\ncutaneous lymphatics, the fat is absorbed from the increased absorption of\r\nthe cellular lymphatics, the mucus of the lungs is too viscid to be easily\r\nspit up by the increased absorption of the thinner parts of it, the\r\nmembrana sneideriana becomes dry, covered with hardened mucus, and at\r\nlength becomes inflamed and full of aphthæ, and either these sloughs, or\r\npulmonary ulcers, terminate the scene.\r\n\r\nII. The immediate cause of dropsy is the paralysis of some other branches\r\nof the absorbent system, which are called lymphatics, and which open into\r\nthe larger cavities of the body, or into the cells of the cellular\r\nmembrane; whence those cavities or cells become distended with the fluid,\r\nwhich is hourly secreted into them for the purpose of lubricating their\r\nsurfaces. As is more fully explained in No. 5. of the next Section.\r\n\r\nAs those lymphatic vessels consist generally of a long neck or mouth, which\r\ndrinks up its appropriated fluid, and of a conglobate gland, in which this\r\nfluid undergoes some change, it happens, that sometimes the mouth of the\r\nlymphatic, and sometimes the belly or glandular part of it, becomes totally\r\nor partially paralytic. In the former case, where the mouths of the\r\ncutaneous lymphatics become torpid or quiescent, the fluid secreted on the\r\nskin ceases to be absorbed, and erodes the skin by its saline acrimony, and\r\nproduces eruptions termed herpes, the discharge from which is as salt, as\r\nthe tears, which are secreted too fast to be reabsorbed, as in grief, or\r\nwhen the puncta lacrymalia are obstructed, and which running down the cheek\r\nredden and inflame the skin.\r\n\r\nWhen the mouths of the lymphatics, which open on the mucous membrane of the\r\nnostrils, become torpid, as on walking into the air in a frosty morning;\r\nthe mucus, which continues to be secreted, has not its aqueous and saline\r\npart reabsorbed, which running over the upper lip inflames it, and has a\r\nsalt taste, if it falls on the tongue.\r\n\r\nWhen the belly, or glandular part of these lymphatics, becomes torpid, the\r\nfluid absorbed by its mouth stagnates, and forms a tumour in the gland.\r\nThis disease is called the scrophula. If these glands suppurate externally,\r\nthey gradually heal, as those of the neck; if they suppurate without an\r\nopening on the external habit, as the mesenteric glands, a hectic fever\r\nensues, which destroys the patient; if they suppurate in the lungs, a\r\npulmonary consumption ensues, which is believed thus to differ from that\r\ndescribed in the preceding Section, in respect to its seat or proximate\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that matter produced by suppuration will lie concealed in\r\nthe body many weeks, or even months, without producing hectic fever; but as\r\nsoon as the wound is opened, so as to admit air to the surface of the\r\nulcer, a hectic fever supervenes, even in very few hours, which is probably\r\nowing to the azotic part of the atmosphere rather than to the oxygene;\r\nbecause those medicines, which contain much oxygene, as the calces or\r\noxydes of metals, externally applied, greatly contribute to heal ulcers, of\r\nthese are the solutions of lead and mercury, and copper in acids, or their\r\nprecipitates.\r\n\r\nHence when wounds are to be healed by the first intention, as it is called,\r\nit is necessary carefully to exclude the air from them. Hence we have one\r\ncause, which prevents pulmonary ulcers from healing, which is their being\r\nperpetually exposed to the air.\r\n\r\nBoth the dark-eyed patients, which are affected with pulmonary ulcers from\r\ndeficient venous absorption, as described in Section. XXVII. 2. and the\r\nlight-eyed patients from deficient lymphatic absorption, which we are now\r\ntreating of, have generally large apertures of the iris; these large pupils\r\nof the eyes are a common mark of want of irritability; and it generally\r\nhappens, that an increase of sensibility, that is, of motions in\r\nconsequence of sensation, attends these constitutions. See Sect. XXXI. 2.\r\nWhence inflammations may occur in these from stagnated fluids more\r\nfrequently than in those constitutions, which possess more irritability and\r\nless sensibility.\r\n\r\nGreat expectations in respect to the cure of consumptions, as well as of\r\nmany other diseases, are produced by the very ingenious exertions of DR.\r\nBEDDOES; who has established an apparatus for breathing various mixtures of\r\nairs or gasses, at the hot-wells near Bristol, which well deserves the\r\nattention of the public.\r\n\r\nDR. BEDDOES very ingeniously concludes, from the florid colour of the blood\r\nof consumptive patients, that it abounds in oxygene; and that the redness\r\nof their tongues, and lips, and the fine blush of their cheeks shew the\r\npresence of the same principle, like flesh reddened by nitre. And adds,\r\nthat the circumstance of the consumptions of pregnant women being stopped\r\nin their progress during pregnancy, at which time their blood may be\r\nsupposed to be in part deprived of its oxygene, by oxygenating the blood of\r\nthe foetus, is a forceable argument in favour of this theory; which must\r\nsoon be confirmed or confuted by his experiments.

The absorbent system of vessels in animal bodies consists of several\r\nbranches, differing in respect to their situations, and to the fluids,\r\nwhich they absorb.\r\n\r\nThe intestinal absorbents open their mouths on the internal surfaces of the\r\nintestines; their office is to drink up the chyle and the other fluids from\r\nthe alimentary canal; and they are termed lacteals, to distinguish them\r\nfrom the other absorbent vessels, which have been termed lymphatics.\r\n\r\nThose, whose mouths are dispersed on the external skin, imbibe a great\r\nquantity of water from the atmosphere, and a part of the perspirable\r\nmatter, which does not evaporate, and are termed cutaneous absorbents.\r\n\r\nThose, which arise from the internal surface of the bronchia, and which\r\nimbibe moisture from the atmosphere, and a part of the bronchial mucus, are\r\ncalled pulmonary absorbents.\r\n\r\nThose, which open their innumerable mouths into the cells of the whole\r\ncellular membrane; and whose use is to take up the fluid, which is poured\r\ninto those cells, after it has done its office there; may be called\r\ncellular absorbents.\r\n\r\nThose, which arise from the internal surfaces of the membranes, which line\r\nthe larger cavities of the body, as the thorax, abdomen, scrotum,\r\npericardium, take up the mucus poured into those cavities; and are\r\ndistinguished by the names of their respective cavities.\r\n\r\nWhilst those, which arise from the internal surfaces of the urinary\r\nbladder, gall-bladder, salivary ducts, or other receptacles of secreted\r\nfluids, may take their names from those fluids; the thinner parts of which\r\nit is their office to absorb: as urinary, bilious, or salivary absorbents.\r\n\r\n2. Many of these absorbent vessels, both lacteals and lymphatics, like some\r\nof the veins, are replete with valves: which seem designed to assist the\r\nprogress of their fluids, or at least to prevent their regurgitation; where\r\nthey are subjected to the intermitted pressure of the muscular, or arterial\r\nactions in their neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThese valves do not however appear to be necessary to all the absorbents,\r\nany more than to all the veins; since they are not found to exist in the\r\nabsorbent system of fish; according to the discoveries of the ingenious,\r\nand much lamented Mr. Hewson. Philos. Trans. v. 59, Enquiries into the\r\nLymph. Syst. p. 94.\r\n\r\n3. These absorbent vessels are also furnished with glands, which are called\r\nconglobate glands; whose use is not at present sufficiently investigated;\r\nbut it is probable that they resemble the conglomerate glands both in\r\nstructure and in use, except that their absorbent mouths are for the\r\nconveniency of situation placed at a greater distance from the body of the\r\ngland. The conglomerate glands open their mouths immediately into the\r\nsanguiferous vessels, which bring the blood, from whence they absorb their\r\nrespective fluids, quite up to the gland: but these conglobate glands\r\ncollect their adapted fluids from very distant membranes, or cysts, by\r\nmeans of mouths furnished with long necks for this purpose; and which are\r\ncalled lacteals, or lymphatics.\r\n\r\n4. The fluids, thus collected from various parts of the body, pass by means\r\nof the thoracic duct into the left subclavian near the jugular vein; except\r\nindeed that those collected from the right side of the head and neck, and\r\nfrom the right arm, are carried into the right subclavian vein: and\r\nsometimes even the lymphatics from the right side of the lungs are inserted\r\ninto the right subclavian vein; whilst those of the left side of the head\r\nopen but just into the summit of the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\n5. In the absorbent system there are many anastomoses of the vessels, which\r\nseem of great consequence to the preservation of health. These anastomoses\r\nare discovered by dissection to be very frequent between the intestinal and\r\nurinary lymphatics, as mentioned by Mr. Hewson, (Phil. Trans. v. 58.)\r\n\r\n6. Nor do all the intestinal absorbents seem to terminate in the thoracic\r\nduct, as appears from some curious experiments of D. Munro, who gave madder\r\nto some animals, having previously put a ligature on the thoracic duct, and\r\nfound their bones, and the serum of their blood, coloured red.\r\n\r\nII. _The Valves of the Absorbent System may suffer their Fluids to\r\nregurgitate in some Diseases._\r\n\r\n1. The many valves, which occur in the progress of the lymphatic and\r\nlacteal vessels, would seem insuperable obstacles to the regurgitation of\r\ntheir contents. But as these valves are placed in vessels, which are indued\r\nwith life, and are themselves indued with life also; and are very irritable\r\ninto those natural motions, which absorb, or propel the fluids they\r\ncontain; it is possible, in some diseases, where these valves or vessels\r\nare stimulated into unnatural exertions, or are become paralytic, that\r\nduring the diastole of the part of the vessel to which the valve is\r\nattached, the valve may not so completely close, as to prevent the relapse\r\nof the lymph or chyle. This is rendered more probable, by the experiments\r\nof injecting mercury, or water, or suet, or by blowing air down these\r\nvessels: all which pass the valves very easily, contrary to the natural\r\ncourse of their fluids, when the vessels are thus a little forcibly\r\ndilated, as mentioned by Dr. Haller, Elem. Physiol. t. iii. s. 4.\r\n\r\n\"The valves of the thoracic duct are few, some assert they are not more\r\nthan twelve, and that they do not very accurately perform their office, as\r\nthey do not close the whole area of the duct, and thence may permit chyle\r\nto repass them downwards. In living animals, however, though not always,\r\nyet more frequently than in the dead, they prevent the chyle from\r\nreturning. The principal of these valves is that, which presides over the\r\ninsertion of the thoracic duct, into the subclavian vein; many have\r\nbelieved this also to perform the office of a valve, both to admit the\r\nchyle into the vein, and to preclude the blood from entering the duct; but\r\nin my opinion it is scarcely sufficient for this purpose.\" Haller, Elem.\r\nPhys. t. vii. p. 226.\r\n\r\n2. The mouths of the lymphatics seem to admit water to pass through them\r\nafter death, the inverted way, easier than the natural one; since an\r\ninverted bladder readily lets out the water with which it is filled; whence\r\nit may be inferred, that there is no obstacle at the mouths of these\r\nvessels to prevent the regurgitation of their contained fluids.\r\n\r\nI was induced to repeat this experiment, and having accurately tied the\r\nureters and neck of a fresh ox's bladder, I made an opening at the fundus\r\nof it; and then, having turned it inside outwards, filled it half full with\r\nwater, and was surprised to see it empty itself so hastily. I thought the\r\nexperiment more apposite to my purpose by suspending the bladder with its\r\nneck downwards, as the lymphatics are chiefly spread upon this part of it,\r\nas shewn by Dr. Watson, Philos. Trans. v. 59. p. 392.\r\n\r\n3. In some diseases, as in the diabetes and scrophula, it is probable the\r\nvalves themselves are diseased, and are thence incapable of preventing the\r\nreturn of the fluids they should support. Thus the valves of the aorta\r\nitself have frequently been found schirrous, according to the dissections\r\nof Mons. Lieutaud, and have given rise to an interrupted pulse, and\r\nlaborious palpitations, by suffering a return of part of the blood into the\r\nheart. Nor are any parts of the body so liable to schirrosity as the\r\nlymphatic glands and vessels, insomuch that their schirrosities have\r\nacquired a distinct name, and been termed scrophula.\r\n\r\n4. There are valves in other parts of the body, analogous to those of the\r\nabsorbent system, and which are liable, when diseased, to regurgitate their\r\ncontents: thus the upper and lower orifices of the stomach are closed by\r\nvalves, which, when too great quantities of warm water have been drank with\r\na design to promote vomiting, have sometimes resisted the utmost efforts of\r\nthe abdominal muscles, and diaphragm: yet, at other times, the upper valve,\r\nor cardia, easily permits the evacuation of the contents of the stomach;\r\nwhilst the inferior valve, or pylorus, permits the bile, and other contents\r\nof the duodenum, to regurgitate into the stomach.\r\n\r\n5. The valve of the colon is well adapted to prevent the retrograde motion\r\nof the excrements; yet, as this valve is possessed of a living power, in\r\nthe iliac passion, either from spasm, or other unnatural exertions, it\r\nkeeps itself open, and either suffers or promotes the retrograde movements\r\nof the contents of the intestines below; as in ruminating animals the mouth\r\nof the first stomach seems to be so constructed, as to facilitate or assist\r\nthe regurgitation of the food; the rings of the oesophagus afterwards\r\ncontracting themselves in inverted order. De Haeu, by means of a syringe,\r\nforced so much water into the rectum intestinum of a dog, that he vomited\r\nit in a full stream from his mouth; and in the iliac passion above\r\nmentioned, excrements and clyster are often evacuated by the mouth. See\r\nSection XXV. 15.\r\n\r\n6. The puncta lacrymalia, with the lacrymal sack and nasal duct, compose a\r\ncomplete gland, and much resemble the intestinal canal: the puncta\r\nlacrymalia are absorbent mouths, that take up the tears from the eye, when\r\nthey have done their office there, and convey them into the nostrils; but\r\nwhen the nasal duct is obstructed, and the lacrymal sack distended with its\r\nfluid, on pressure with the finger the mouths of this gland (puncta\r\nlacrymalia) will readily disgorge the fluid, they had previously absorbed,\r\nback into the eye.\r\n\r\n7. As the capillary vessels receive blood from the arteries, and separating\r\nthe mucus, or perspirable matter from it, convey the remainder back by the\r\nveins; these capillary vessels are a set of glands, in every respect\r\nsimilar to the secretory vessels of the liver, or other large congeries of\r\nglands. The beginnings of these capillary vessels have frequent anastomoses\r\ninto each other, in which circumstance they are resembled by the lacteals;\r\nand like the mouths or beginnings of other glands, they are a set of\r\nabsorbent vessels, which drink up the blood which is brought to them by the\r\narteries, as the chyle is drank up by the lacteals: for the circulation of\r\nthe blood through the capillaries is proved to be independent of arterial\r\nimpulse; since in the blush of shame, and in partial inflammations, their\r\naction is increased, without any increase of the motion of the heart.\r\n\r\n8. Yet not only the mouths, or beginnings of these anastomosing capillaries\r\nare frequently seen by microscopes, to regurgitate some particles of blood,\r\nduring the struggles of the animal; but retrograde motion of the blood, in\r\nthe veins of those animals, from the very heart of the extremity of the\r\nlimbs, is observable, by intervals, during the distresses of the dying\r\ncreature. Haller, Elem. Physiol. t. i. p. 216. Now, as the veins have\r\nperhaps all of them a valve somewhere between their extremities and the\r\nheart, here is ocular demonstration of the fluids in this diseased\r\ncondition of the animal, repassing through venous valves: and it is hence\r\nhighly probable, from the strictest analogy, that if the course of the\r\nfluids, in the lymphatic vessels, could be subjected to microscopic\r\nobservation, they would also, in the diseased state of the animal, be seen\r\nto repass the valves, and the mouths of those vessels, which had previously\r\nabsorbed them, or promoted their progression.\r\n\r\nIII. _Communication from the Alimentary Canal to the Bladder, by means of\r\nthe Absorbent Vessels._\r\n\r\nMany medical philosophers, both ancient and modern, have suspected that\r\nthere was a nearer communication between the stomach and the urinary\r\nbladder, than that of the circulation: they were led into this opinion from\r\nthe great expedition with which cold water, when drank to excess, passes\r\noff by the bladder; and from the similarity of the urine, when produced in\r\nthis hasty manner, with the material that was drank.\r\n\r\nThe former of these circumstances happens perpetually to those who drink\r\nabundance of cold water, when they are much heated by exercise, and to many\r\nat the beginning of intoxication.\r\n\r\nOf the latter, many instances are recorded by Etmuller, t. xi. p. 716.\r\nwhere simple water, wine, and wine with sugar, and emulsions, were returned\r\nby urine unchanged.\r\n\r\nThere are other experiments, that seem to demonstrate the existence of\r\nanother passage to the bladder, besides that through the kidneys. Thus Dr.\r\nKratzenstein put ligatures on the ureters of a dog, and then emptied the\r\nbladder by a catheter; yet in a little time the dog drank greedily, and\r\nmade a quantity of water, (Disputat. Morbor. Halleri. t. iv. p. 63.) A\r\nsimilar experiment is related in the Philosophical Transactions, with the\r\nsame event, (No. 65, 67, for the year 1670.)\r\n\r\nAdd to this, that in some morbid cases the urine has continued to pass,\r\nafter the suppuration or total destruction of the kidneys; of which many\r\ninstances are referred to in the Elem. Physiol. t. vii. p. 379. of Dr.\r\nHaller.\r\n\r\nFrom all which it must be concluded, that some fluids have passed from the\r\nstomach or abdomen, without having gone through the sanguiferous\r\ncirculation: and as the bladder is supplied with many lymphatics, as\r\ndescribed by Dr. Watson, in the Philos. Trans. v. 59. p. 392. and as no\r\nother vessels open into it besides these and the ureters, it seems evident,\r\nthat the unnatural urine, produced as above described, when the ureters\r\nwere tied, or the kidneys obliterated, was carried into the bladder by the\r\nretrograde motions of the urinary branch of the lymphatic system.\r\n\r\nThe more certainly to ascertain the existence of another communication\r\nbetween the stomach and bladder, besides that of the circulation, the\r\nfollowing experiment was made, to which I must beg your patient\r\nattention:--A friend of mine (June 14, 1772) on drinking repeatedly of cold\r\nsmall punch, till he began to be intoxicated, made a quantity of colourless\r\nurine. He then drank about two drams of nitre dissolved in some of the\r\npunch, and eat about twenty stalks of boiled asparagus: on continuing to\r\ndrink more of the punch, the next urine that he made was quite clear, and\r\nwithout smell; but in a little time another quantity was made, which was\r\nnot quite so colourless, and had a strong smell of the asparagus: he then\r\nlost about four ounces of blood from the arm.\r\n\r\nThe smell of asparagus was not at all perceptible in the blood, neither\r\nwhen fresh taken, nor the next morning, as myself and two others accurately\r\nattended to; yet this smell was strongly perceived in the urine, which was\r\nmade just before the blood was taken from his arm.\r\n\r\nSome bibulous paper, moistened in the serum of this blood, and suffered to\r\ndry, shewed no signs of nitre by its manner of burning. But some of the\r\nsame paper, moistened in the urine, and dried, on being ignited, evidently\r\nshewed the presence of nitre. This blood and the urine stood some days\r\nexposed to the sun in the open air, till they were evaporated to about a\r\nfourth of their original quantity, and began to stink: the paper, which was\r\nthen moistened with the concentrated urine, shewed the presence of much\r\nnitre by its manner of burning; whilst that moistened with the blood shewed\r\nno such appearance at all.\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that certain fluids at the beginning of intoxication,\r\nfind another passage to the bladder besides the long course of the arterial\r\ncirculation; and as the intestinal absorbents are joined with the urinary\r\nlymphatics by frequent anastomoses, as Hewson has demonstrated; and as\r\nthere is no other road, we may justly conclude, that these fluids pass into\r\nthe bladder by the urinary branch of the lymphatics, which has its motions\r\ninverted during the diseased state of the animal.\r\n\r\nA gentleman, who had been some weeks affected with jaundice, and whose\r\nurine was in consequence of a very deep yellow, took some cold small punch,\r\nin which was dissolved about a dram of nitre; he then took repeated\r\ndraughts of the punch, and kept himself in a cool room, till on the\r\napproach of slight intoxication he made a large quantity of water; this\r\nwater had a slight yellow tinge, as might be expected from a small\r\nadmixture of bile secreted from the kidneys; but if the whole of it had\r\npassed through the sanguiferous vessels, which were now replete with bile\r\n(his whole skin being as yellow as gold) would not this urine also, as well\r\nas that he had made for weeks before, have been of a deep yellow? Paper\r\ndipped in this water, and dryed, and ignited, shewed evident marks of the\r\npresence of nitre, when the flame was blown out.\r\n\r\nIV. _The Phænomena of the Diabetes explained, and of some Diarrhoeas._\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of many diseases are only explicable from the retrograde\r\nmotions of some of the branches of the lymphatic system; as the great and\r\nimmediate flow of pale urine in the beginning of drunkenness; in hysteric\r\nparoxysms; from being exposed to cold air; or to the influence of fear or\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nBefore we endeavour to illustrate this doctrine, by describing the\r\nphænomena of these diseases, we must premise one circumstance; that all the\r\nbranches of the lymphatic system have a certain sympathy with each other,\r\ninsomuch that when one branch is stimulated into unusual kinds or\r\nquantities of motion, some other branch has its motions either increased,\r\nor decreased, or inverted at the same time. This kind of sympathy can only\r\nbe proved by the concurrent testimony of numerous facts, which will be\r\nrelated in the course of the work. I shall only add here, that it is\r\nprobable, that this sympathy does not depend on any communication of\r\nnervous filaments, but on habit; owing to the various branches of this\r\nsystem having frequently been stimulated into action at the same time.\r\n\r\nThere are a thousand instances of involuntary motions associated in this\r\nmanner; as in the act of vomiting, while the motions of the stomach and\r\noesophagus are inverted, the pulsations of the arterial system by a certain\r\nsympathy become weaker; and when the bowels or kidneys are stimulated by\r\npoison, a stone, or inflammation, into more violent action; the stomach and\r\noesophagus by sympathy invert their motions.\r\n\r\n1. When any one drinks a moderate quantity of vinous spirit, the whole\r\nsystem acts with more energy by consent with the stomach and intestines, as\r\nis seen from the glow on the skin, and the increase of strength and\r\nactivity; but when a greater quantity of this inebriating material is\r\ndrank, at the same time that the lacteals are excited into greater action\r\nto absorb it; it frequently happens, that the urinary branch of absorbents,\r\nwhich is connected with the lacteals by many anastomoses, inverts its\r\nmotions, and a great quantity of pale unanimalized urine is discharged. By\r\nthis wise contrivance too much of an unnecessary fluid is prevented from\r\nentering the circulation--This may be called the drunken diabetes, to\r\ndistinguish it from the other temporary diabetes, which occur in hysteric\r\ndiseases, and from continued fear or anxiety.\r\n\r\n2. If this idle ingurgitation of too much vinous spirit be daily practised,\r\nthe urinary branch of absorbents at length gains an habit of inverting its\r\nmotions, whenever the lacteals are much stimulated; and the whole or a\r\ngreat part of the chyle is thus daily carried to the bladder without\r\nentering the circulation, and the body becomes emaciated. This is one kind\r\nof chronic diabetes, and may be distinguished from the others by the taste\r\nand appearance of the urine; which is sweet, and the colour of whey, and\r\nmay be termed the chyliferous diabetes.\r\n\r\n3. Many children have a similar deposition of chyle in their urine, from\r\nthe irritation of worms in their intestines, which stimulating the mouths\r\nof the lacteals into unnatural action, the urinary branch of the absorbents\r\nbecomes inverted, and carries part of the chyle to the bladder: part of the\r\nchyle also has been carried to the iliac and lumbar glands, of which\r\ninstances are recorded by Haller, t. vii. 225. and which can be explained\r\non no other theory: but the dissections of the lymphatic system of the\r\nhuman body, which have yet been published, are not sufficiently extensive\r\nfor our purpose; yet if we may reason from comparative anatomy, this\r\ntranslation of chyle to the bladder is much illustrated by the account\r\ngiven of this system of vessels in a turtle, by Mr. Hewson, who observed,\r\n\"That the lacteals near the root of the mesentery anastomose, so as to form\r\na net-work, from which several large branches go into some considerable\r\nlymphatics lying near the spine; and which can be traced almost to the\r\nanus, and particularly to the kidneys.\" Philos. Trans. v. 59. p.\r\n199--Enquiries, p. 74.\r\n\r\n4. At the same time that the urinary branch of absorbents, in the beginning\r\nof diabetes, is excited into inverted action, the cellular branch is\r\nexcited by the sympathy above mentioned, into more energetic action; and\r\nthe fat, that was before deposited, is reabsorbed and thrown into the blood\r\nvessels; where it floats, and was mistaken for chyle, till the late\r\nexperiments of the ingenious Mr. Hewson demonstrated it to be fat.\r\n\r\nThis appearance of what was mistaken for chyle in the blood, which was\r\ndrawn from these patients, and the obstructed liver, which very frequently\r\naccompanies this disease, seems to have led Dr. Mead to suspect the\r\ndiabetes was owing to a defect of sanguification; and that the schirrosity\r\nof the liver was the original cause of it: but as the schirrhus of the\r\nliver is most frequently owing to the same causes, that produce the\r\ndiabetes and dropsies; namely, the great use of fermented liquors; there is\r\nno wonder they should exist together, without being the consequence of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n5. If the cutaneous branch of absorbents gains a habit of being excited\r\ninto stronger action, and imbibes greater quantities of moisture from the\r\natmosphere, at the same time that the urinary branch has its motions\r\ninverted, another kind of diabetes is formed, which may be termed the\r\naqueous diabetes. In this diabetes the cutaneous absorbents frequently\r\nimbibe an amazing quantity of atmospheric moisture; insomuch that there are\r\nauthentic histories, where many gallons a day, for many weeks together,\r\nabove the quantity that has been drank, have been discharged by urine.\r\n\r\nDr. Keil, in his Medicina Statica, found that he gained eighteen ounces\r\nfrom the moist air of one night; and Dr. Percival affirms, that one of his\r\nhands imbibed, after being well chafed, near an ounce and half of water, in\r\na quarter of an hour. (Transact. of the College, London, vol. ii. p. 102.)\r\nHome's Medic. Facts, p. 2. sect. 3.\r\n\r\nThe pale urine in hysterical women, or which is produced by fear or\r\nanxiety, is a temporary complaint of this kind; and it would in reality be\r\nthe same disease, if it was confirmed by habit.\r\n\r\n6. The purging stools, and pale urine, occasioned by exposing the naked\r\nbody to cold air, or sprinkling it with cold water, originate from a\r\nsimilar cause; for the mouths of the cutaneous lymphatics being suddenly\r\nexposed to cold become torpid, and cease, or nearly cease, to act; whilst,\r\nby the sympathy above described, not only the lymphatics of the bladder and\r\nintestines cease also to absorb the more aqueous and saline part of the\r\nfluids secreted into them; but it is probable that these lymphatics invert\r\ntheir motions, and return the fluids, which were previously absorbed, into\r\nthe intestines and bladder. At the very instant that the body is exposed\r\nnaked to the cold air, an unusual movement is felt in the bowels; as is\r\nexperienced by boys going into the cold bath: this could not occur from an\r\nobstruction of the perspirable matter, since there is not time, for that to\r\nbe returned to the bowels by the course of the circulation.\r\n\r\nThere is also a chronic aqueous diarrhoea, in which the atmospheric\r\nmoisture, drank up by the cutaneous and pulmonary lymphatics, is poured\r\ninto the intestines, by the retrograde motions of the lacteals. This\r\ndisease is most similar to the aqueous diabetes, and is frequently\r\nexchanged for it: a distinct instance of this is recorded by Benningerus,\r\nCent. v. Obs. 98. in which an aqueous diarrhoea succeeded an aqueous\r\ndiabetes, and destroyed the patient. There is a curious example of this,\r\ndescribed by Sympson (De Re Medica)--\"A young man (says he) was seized with\r\na fever, upon which a diarrhoea came on, with great stupor; and he refused\r\nto drink any thing, though he was parched up with excessive heat: the\r\nbetter to supply him with moisture, I directed his feet to be immersed in\r\ncold water; immediately I observed a wonderful decrease of water in the\r\nvessel, and then an impetuous stream of a fluid, scarcely coloured, was\r\ndischarged by stool, like a cataract.\"\r\n\r\n7. There is another kind of diarrhoea, which has been called cæliaca; in\r\nthis disease the chyle, drank up by the lacteals of the small intestines,\r\nis probably poured into the large intestines, by the retrograde motions of\r\ntheir lacteals: as in the chyliferous diabetes, the chyle is poured into\r\nthe bladder, by the retrograde motions of the urinary branch of absorbents.\r\n\r\nThe chyliferous diabetes, like this chyliferous diarrhoea, produces sudden\r\natrophy; since the nourishment, which ought to supply the hourly waste of\r\nthe body, is expelled by the bladder, or rectum: whilst the aqueous\r\ndiabetes, and the aqueous diarrhoea produce excessive thirst; because the\r\nmoisture, which is obtained from the atmosphere, is not conveyed to the\r\nthoracic receptacle, as it ought to be, but to the bladder, or lower\r\nintestines; whence the chyle, blood, and whole system of glands, are robbed\r\nof their proportion of humidity.\r\n\r\n8. There is a third species of diabetes, in which the urine is\r\nmucilaginous, and appears ropy in pouring it from one vessel into another;\r\nand will sometimes coagulate over the fire. This disease appears by\r\nintervals, and ceases again, and seems to be occasioned by a previous\r\ndropsy in some part of the body. When such a collection is reabsorbed, it\r\nis not always returned into the circulation; but the same irritation that\r\nstimulates one lymphatic branch to reabsorb the deposited fluid, inverts\r\nthe urinary branch, and pours it into the bladder. Hence this mucilaginous\r\ndiabetes is a cure, or the consequence of a cure, of a worse disease,\r\nrather than a disease itself.\r\n\r\nDr. Cotunnius gave half an ounce of cream of tartar, every morning, to a\r\npatient, who had the anasarca; and he voided a great quantity of urine; a\r\npart of which, put over the fire, coagulated, on the evaporation of half of\r\nit, so as to look like the white of an egg. De Ischiade Nervos.\r\n\r\nThis kind of diabetes frequently precedes a dropsy; and has this remarkable\r\ncircumstance attending it, that it generally happens in the night; as\r\nduring the recumbent state of the body, the fluid, that was accumulated in\r\nthe cellular membrane, or in the lungs, is more readily absorbed, as it is\r\nless impeded by its gravity. I have seen more than one instance of this\r\ndisease. Mr. D. a man in the decline of life, who had long accustomed\r\nhimself to spirituous liquor, had swelled legs, and other symptoms of\r\napproaching anasarca; about once in a week, or ten days, for several\r\nmonths, he was seized, on going to bed, with great general uneasiness,\r\nwhich his attendants resembled to an hysteric fit; and which terminated in\r\na great discharge of viscid urine; his legs became less swelled, and he\r\ncontinued in better health for some days afterwards. I had not the\r\nopportunity to try if this urine would coagulate over the fire, when part\r\nof it was evaporated, which I imagine would be the criterion of this kind\r\nof diabetes; as the mucilaginous fluid deposited in the cells and cysts of\r\nthe body, which have no communication with the external air, seems to\r\nacquire, by stagnation, this property of coagulation by heat, which the\r\nsecreted mucus of the intestines and bladder do not appear to possess; as I\r\nhave found by experiment: and if any one should suppose this coagulable\r\nurine was separated from the blood by the kidneys, he may recollect, that\r\nin the most inflammatory diseases, in which the blood is most replete or\r\nmost ready to part with the coagulable lymph, none of this appears in the\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n9. Different kinds of diabetes require different methods of cure. For the\r\nfirst kind, or chyliferous diabetes, after clearing the stomach and\r\nintestines, by ipecacuanha and rhubarb, to evacuate any acid material,\r\nwhich may too powerfully stimulate the mouths of the lacteals, repeated and\r\nlarge doses of tincture of cantharides have been much recommended. The\r\nspecific stimulus of this medicine, on the neck of the bladder, is likely\r\nto excite the numerous absorbent vessels, which are spread on that part,\r\ninto stronger natural actions, and by that means prevent their retrograde\r\nones; till, by persisting in the use of the medicine, their natural habits\r\nof motions might again be established. Another indication of cure, requires\r\nsuch medicines, as by lining the intestines with mucilaginous substances,\r\nor with such as consist of smooth particles, or which chemically destroy\r\nthe acrimony of their contents, may prevent the too great action of the\r\nintestinal absorbents. For this purpose, I have found the earth\r\nprecipitated from a solution of alum, by means of fixed alcali, given in\r\nthe dose of half a dram every six hours, of great advantage, with a few\r\ngrains of rhubarb, so as to produce a daily evacuation.\r\n\r\nThe food should consist of materials that have the least stimulus, with\r\ncalcareous water, as of Bristol and Matlock; that the mouths of the\r\nlacteals may be as little stimulated as is necessary for their proper\r\nabsorption; lest with their greater exertions, should be connected by\r\nsympathy, the inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics.\r\n\r\nThe same method may be employed with equal advantage in the aqueous\r\ndiabetes, so great is the sympathy between the skin and the stomach. To\r\nwhich, however, some application to the skin might be usefully added; as\r\nrubbing the patient all over with oil, to prevent the too great action of\r\nthe cutaneous absorbents. I knew an experiment of this kind made upon one\r\npatient with apparent advantage.\r\n\r\nThe mucilaginous diabetes will require the same treatment, which is most\r\nefficacious in the dropsy, and will be described below. I must add, that\r\nthe diet and medicines above mentioned, are strongly recommended by various\r\nauthors, as by Morgan, Willis, Harris, and Etmuller; but more histories of\r\nthe successful treatment of these diseases are wanting to fully ascertain\r\nthe most efficacious methods of cure.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Mr. Charles Darwin, dated April 24, 1778, Edinburgh, is\r\nthe subsequent passage:--\"A man who had long laboured under a diabetes died\r\nyesterday in the clinical ward. He had for some time drank four, and passed\r\ntwelve pounds of fluid daily; each pound of urine contained an ounce of\r\nsugar. He took, without considerable relief, gum kino, sanguis diaconis\r\nmelted with alum, tincture of cantharides, isinglass, gum arabic, crabs\r\neyes, spirit of hartshorn, and eat ten or fifteen oysters thrice a day. Dr.\r\nHome, having read my thesis, bled him, and found that neither the fresh\r\nblood nor the serum tasted sweet. His body was opened this morning--every\r\nviscus appeared in a sound and natural state, except that the left kidney\r\nhad a very small pelvis, and that there was a considerable enlargement of\r\nmost of the mesenteric lymphatic glands. I intend to insert this in my\r\nthesis, as it coincides with the experiment, where some asparagus was eaten\r\nat the beginning of intoxication, and its smell perceived in the urine,\r\nthough not in the blood.\"\r\n\r\nThe following case of chyliferous diabetes is extracted from some letters\r\nof Mr. Hughes, to whose unremitted care the infirmary at Stafford for many\r\nyears was much indebted. Dated October 10, 1778.\r\n\r\nRichard Davis, aged 33, a whitesmith by trade, had drank hard by intervals;\r\nwas much troubled with sweating of his hands, which incommoded him in his\r\noccupation, but which ceased on his frequently dipping them in lime. About\r\nseven months ago he began to make large quantities of water; his legs are\r\noedematous, his belly tense, and he complains of a rising in his throat,\r\nlike the globus hystericus: he eats twice as much as other people, drinks\r\nabout fourteen pints of small beer a day, besides a pint of ale, some\r\nmilk-porridge, and a bason of broth, and he makes about eighteen pints of\r\nwater a day.\r\n\r\nHe tried alum, dragon's blood, steel, blue vitriol, and cantharides in\r\nlarge quantities, and duly repeated, under the care of Dr. Underhill, but\r\nwithout any effect; except that on the day after he omitted the\r\ncantharides, he made but twelve pints of water, but on the next day this\r\ngood effect ceased again.\r\n\r\nNovember 21.--He made eighteen pints of water, and he now, at Dr. Darwin's\r\nrequest, took a grain of opium every four hours, and five grains of aloes\r\nat night; and had a flannel shirt given him.\r\n\r\n22.--Made sixteen pints. 23.--Thirteen pints: drinks less.\r\n\r\n24.--Increased the opium to a grain and quarter every four hours: he made\r\ntwelve pints.\r\n\r\n25.--Increased the opium to a grain and half: he now makes ten pints; and\r\ndrinks eight pints in a day.\r\n\r\nThe opium was gradually increased during the next fortnight, till he took\r\nthree grains every four hours, but without any further diminution of his\r\nwater. During the use of the opium he sweat much in the nights, so as to\r\nhave large drops stand on his face and all over him. The quantity of opium\r\nwas then gradually decreased, but not totally omitted, as he continued to\r\ntake about a grain morning and evening.\r\n\r\nJanuary 17.--He makes fourteen pints of water a day. Dr. Underhill now\r\ndirected him two scruples of common rosin triturated with as much sugar,\r\nevery six hours; and three grains of opium every night.\r\n\r\n19.--Makes fifteen pints of water: sweats at night.\r\n\r\n21.--Makes seventeen pints of water; has twitchings of his limbs in a\r\nmorning, and pains of his legs: he now takes a dram of rosin for a dose,\r\nand continues the opium.\r\n\r\n23.--Water more coloured, and reduced to sixteen pints, and he thinks has a\r\nbrackish taste.\r\n\r\n26.--Water reduced to fourteen pints.\r\n\r\n28.--Water thirteen pints: he continues the opium, and takes four scruples\r\nof the rosin for a dose.\r\n\r\nFebruary 1.--Water twelve pints.\r\n\r\n4.--Water eleven pints: twitchings less; takes five scruples for a dose.\r\n\r\n8.--Water ten pints: has had many stools.\r\n\r\n12.--Appetite less: purges very much.\r\n\r\nAfter this the rosin either purged him, or would not stay on his stomach;\r\nand he gradually relapsed nearly to his former condition, and in a few\r\nmonths sunk under the disease.\r\n\r\nOctober 3, Mr. Hughes evaporated two quarts of the water, and obtained from\r\nit four ounces and half of a hard and brittle saccharine mass, like treacle\r\nwhich had been some time boiled. Four ounces of blood, which he took from\r\nhis arm with design to examine it, had the common appearances, except that\r\nthe serum resembled cheese-whey; and that on the evidence of four persons,\r\ntwo of whom did not know what it was they tasted, _the serum had a saltish\r\ntaste_.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it appears, that the saccharine matter, with which the urine of\r\nthese patients so much abounds, does not enter the blood-vessels like the\r\nnitre and asparagus mentioned above; but that the process of digestion\r\nresembles the process of the germination of vegetables, or of making barley\r\ninto malt; as the vast quantity of sugar found in the urine must be made\r\nfrom the food which he took (which was double that taken by others), and\r\nfrom the fourteen pints of small beer which he drank. And, secondly, as the\r\nserum of the blood was not sweet, the chyle appears to have been conveyed\r\nto the bladder without entering the circulation of the blood, since so\r\nlarge a quantity of sugar, as was found in the urine, namely, twenty ounces\r\na day, could not have previously existed in the blood without being\r\nperceptible to the taste.\r\n\r\nNovember 1. Mr. Hughes dissolved two drams of nitre in a pint of a\r\ndecoction of the roots of asparagus, and added to it two ounces of tincture\r\nof rhubarb: the patient took a fourth part of this mixture every five\r\nminutes, till he had taken the whole.--In about half an hour he made\r\neighteen ounces of water, which was very manifestly tinged with the\r\nrhubarb; the smell of asparagus was doubtful.\r\n\r\nHe then lost four ounces of blood, the serum of which was not so opake as\r\nthat drawn before, but of a yellowish cast, as the serum of the blood\r\nusually appears.\r\n\r\nPaper, dipped three or four times in the tinged urine and dried again, did\r\nnot scintillate when it was set on fire; but when the flame was blown out,\r\nthe fire ran along the paper for half an inch; which, when the same paper\r\nwas unimpregnated, it would not do; nor when the same paper was dipped in\r\nurine made before he took the nitre, and dried in the same manner.\r\n\r\nPaper, dipped in the serum of the blood and dried in the same manner as in\r\nthe urine, did not scintillate when the flame was blown out, but burnt\r\nexactly in the same manner as the same paper dipped in the serum of blood\r\ndrawn from another person.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, which is copied from a letter of Mr. Hughes, as well as\r\nthe former, seems to evince the existence of another passage from the\r\nintestines to the bladder, in this disease, besides that of the\r\nsanguiferous system; and coincides with the curious experiment related in\r\nsection the third, except that the smell of the asparagus was not here\r\nperceived, owing perhaps to the roots having been made use of instead of\r\nthe heads.\r\n\r\nThe rising in the throat of this patient, and the twitchings of his limbs,\r\nseem to indicate some similarity between the diabetes and the hysteric\r\ndisease, besides the great flow of pale urine, which is common to them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if the mesenteric glands were nicely inspected in the dissections\r\nof these patients; and if the thoracic duct, and the larger branches of the\r\nlacteals, and if the lymphatics, which arise from the bladder, were well\r\nexamined by injection, or by the knife, the cause of diabetes might be more\r\ncertainly understood.\r\n\r\nThe opium alone, and the opium with the rosin, seem much to have served\r\nthis patient, and might probably have effected a cure, if the disease had\r\nbeen slighter, or the medicine had been exhibited, before it had been\r\nconfirmed by habit during the seven months it had continued. The increase\r\nof the quantity of water on beginning the large doses of rosin was probably\r\nowing to his omitting the morning doses of opium.\r\n\r\nV. _The Phænomena of Dropsies explained._\r\n\r\nI. Some inebriates have their paroxysms of inebriety terminated by much\r\npale urine, or profuse sweats, or vomiting, or stools; others have their\r\nparoxysms terminated by stupor, or sleep, without the above evacuations.\r\n\r\nThe former kind of these inebriates have been observed to be more liable to\r\ndiabetes and dropsy; and the latter to gout, gravel, and leprosy. Evoe!\r\nattend ye bacchanalians! start at this dark train of evils, and, amid your\r\nimmodest jests, and idiot laughter, recollect,\r\n\r\n  Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.\r\n\r\nIn those who are subject to diabetes and dropsy, the absorbent vessels are\r\nnaturally more irritable than in the latter; and by being frequently\r\ndisturbed or inverted by violent stimulus, and by their too great sympathy\r\nwith each other, they become at length either entirely paralytic, or are\r\nonly susceptible of motion from the stimulus of very acrid materials; as\r\nevery part of the body, after having been used to great irritations,\r\nbecomes less affected by smaller ones. Thus we cannot distinguish objects\r\nin the night, for some time after we come out of a strong light, though the\r\niris is presently dilated; and the air of a summer evening appears cold,\r\nafter we have been exposed to the heat of the day.\r\n\r\nThere are no cells in the body, where dropsy may not be produced, if the\r\nlymphatics cease to absorb that mucilaginous fluid, which is perpetually\r\ndeposited in them, for the purpose of lubricating their surfaces.\r\n\r\nIf the lymphatic branch, which opens into the cellular membrane, either\r\ndoes its office imperfectly, or not at all; these cells become replete with\r\na mucilaginous fluid, which, after it has stagnated some time in the cells,\r\nwill coagulate over the fire; and is erroneously called water. Wherever the\r\nseat of this disease is, (unless in the lungs or other pendent viscera) the\r\nmucilaginous liquid above mentioned will subside to the most depending\r\nparts of the body, as the feet and legs, when those are lower than the head\r\nand trunk; for all these cells have communications with each other.\r\n\r\nWhen the cellular absorbents are become insensible to their usual\r\nirritations, it most frequently happens, but not always, that the cutaneous\r\nbranch of absorbents, which is strictly associated with them, suffers the\r\nlike inability. And then, as no water is absorbed from the atmosphere, the\r\nurine is not only less diluted at the time of its secretion, and\r\nconsequently in less quantity and higher coloured: but great thirst is at\r\nthe same time induced, for as no water is absorbed from the atmosphere to\r\ndilute the chyle and blood, the lacteals and other absorbent vessels, which\r\nhave not lost their powers, are excited into more constant or more violent\r\naction, to supply this deficiency; whence the urine becomes still less in\r\nquantity, and of a deeper colour, and turbid like the yolk of an egg, owing\r\nto a greater absorption of its thinner parts. From this stronger action of\r\nthose absorbents, which still retain their irritability, the fat is also\r\nabsorbed, and the whole body becomes emaciated. This increased exertion of\r\nsome branches of the lymphatics, while others are totally or partially\r\nparalytic, is resembled by what constantly occurs in the hemiplagia; when\r\nthe patient has lost the use of the limbs on one side, he is incessantly\r\nmoving those of the other; for the moving power, not having access to the\r\nparalytic limbs, becomes redundant in those which are not diseased.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of urine and thirst cannot be explained from a greater quantity\r\nof mucilaginous fluid being deposited in the cellular membrane: for though\r\nthese symptoms have continued many weeks, or even months, this collection\r\nfrequently does not amount to more than very few pints. Hence also the\r\ndifficulty of promoting copious sweats in anasarca is accounted for, as\r\nwell as the great thirst, paucity of urine, and loss of fat; since, when\r\nthe cutaneous branch of absorbents is paralytic, or nearly so, there is\r\nalready too small a quantity of aqueous fluid in the blood: nor can these\r\ntorpid cutaneous lymphatics be readily excited into retrograde motions.\r\n\r\nHence likewise we understand, why in the ascites, and some other dropsies,\r\nthere is often no thirst, and no paucity of urine; in these cases the\r\ncutaneous absorbents continue to do their office.\r\n\r\nSome have believed, that dropsies were occasioned by the inability of the\r\nkidneys, from having only observed the paucity of urine; and have thence\r\nlaboured much to obtain diuretic medicines; but it is daily observable,\r\nthat those who die of a total inability to make water, do not become\r\ndropsical in consequence of it: Fernelius mentions one, who laboured under\r\na perfect suppression of urine during twenty days before his death, and yet\r\nhad no symptoms of dropsy. Pathol. 1. vi. c. 8. From the same idea many\r\nphysicians have restrained their patients from drinking, though their\r\nthirst has been very urgent; and some cases have been published, where this\r\ncruel regimen has been thought advantageous: but others of nicer\r\nobservation are of opinion, that it has always aggravated the distresses of\r\nthe patient; and though it has abated his swellings, yet by inducing a\r\nfever it has hastened his dissolution. See Transactions of the College,\r\nLondon, vol. ii. p. 235. Cases of Dropsy by Dr. G. Baker.\r\n\r\nThe cure of anasarca, so far as respects the evacuation of the accumulated\r\nfluid, coincides with the idea of the retrograde action of the lymphatic\r\nsystem. It is well known that vomits, and other drugs, which induce\r\nsickness or nausea; at the same time that they evacuate the stomach,\r\nproduce a great absorption of the lymph accumulated in the cellular\r\nmembrane. In the operation of a vomit, not only the motions of the stomach\r\nand duodenum become inverted, but also those of the lymphatics and\r\nlacteals, which belong to them; whence a great quantity of chyle and lymph\r\nis perpetually poured into the stomach and intestines, during the\r\noperation, and evacuated by the mouth. Now at the same time, other branches\r\nof the lymphatic system, viz. those which open on the cellular membrane,\r\nare brought into more energetic action, by the sympathy above mentioned,\r\nand an increase of their absorption is produced.\r\n\r\nHence repeated vomits, and cupreous salts, and small doses of squill or\r\nfoxglove, are so efficacious in this disease. And as drastic purges act\r\nalso by inverting the motions of the lacteals; and thence the other\r\nbranches of lymphatics are induced into more powerful natural action, by\r\nsympathy, and drink up the fluids from all the cells of the body; and by\r\ntheir anastomoses, pour them into the lacteal branches; which, by their\r\ninverted actions, return them into the intestines; and they are thus\r\nevacuated from the body:--these purges also are used with success in\r\ndischarging the accumulated fluid in anasarca.\r\n\r\nII. The following cases are related with design to ascertain the particular\r\nkinds of dropsy in which the digitalis purpurea, or common foxglove, is\r\npreferable to squill, or other evacuants, and were first published in 1780,\r\nin a pamphlet entitled Experiments on mucilaginous and purulent Matter, &c.\r\nCadell. London. Other cases of dropsy, treated with digitalis, were\r\nafterwards published by Dr. Darwin in the Medical Transactions, vol. iii.\r\nin which there is a mistake in respect to the dose of the powder of\r\nfoxglove, which should have been from five grains to one, instead of from\r\nfive grains to ten.\r\n\r\n_Anasarca of the Lungs._\r\n\r\n1. A lady, between forty and fifty years of age, had been indisposed some\r\ntime, was then seized with cough and fever, and afterwards expectorated\r\nmuch digested mucus. This expectoration suddenly ceased, and a considerable\r\ndifficulty of breathing supervened, with a pulse very irregular both in\r\nvelocity and strength; she was much distressed at first lying down, and at\r\nfirst rising; but after a minute or two bore either of those attitudes with\r\nease. She had no pain or numbness in her arms; she had no hectic fever, nor\r\nany cold shiverings, and the urine was in due quantity, and of the natural\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of breathing was twice considerably relieved by small doses\r\nof ipecacuanha, which operated upwards and downwards, but recurred in a few\r\ndays: she was then directed a decoction of foxglove, (digitalis purpurea)\r\nprepared by boiling four ounces of the fresh leaves from two pints of water\r\nto one pint; to which was added two ounces of vinous spirit: she took three\r\nlarge spoonfuls of this mixture every two hours, till she had taken it four\r\ntimes; a continued sickness supervened, with frequent vomiting, and a\r\ncopious flow of urine: these evacuations continued at intervals for two or\r\nthree days, and relieved the difficulty of breathing--She had some relapses\r\nafterwards, which were again relieved by the repetition of the decoction of\r\nfoxglove.\r\n\r\n2. A gentleman, about sixty years of age, who had been addicted to an\r\nimmoderate use of fermented liquors, and had been very corpulent, gradually\r\nlost his strength and flesh, had great difficulty of breathing, with legs\r\nsomewhat swelled, and a very irregular pulse. He was very much distressed\r\nat first lying down, and at first rising from his bed, yet in a minute or\r\ntwo was easy in both those attitudes. He made straw-coloured urine in due\r\nquantity, and had no pain or numbness of his arms.\r\n\r\nHe took a large spoonful of the decoction of foxglove, as above, every\r\nhour, for ten or twelve successive hours, had incessant sickness for about\r\ntwo days, and passed a large quantity of urine; upon which his breath\r\nbecame quite easy, and the swelling of his legs subsided; but as his whole\r\nconstitution was already sinking from the previous intemperance of his\r\nlife, he did not survive more than three or four months.\r\n\r\n_Hydrops Pericardii._\r\n\r\n3. A gentleman of temperate life and sedulous application to business,\r\nbetween thirty and forty years of age, had long been subject, at intervals,\r\nto an irregular pulse: a few months ago he became weak, with difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and dry cough. In this situation a physician of eminence\r\ndirected him to abstain from all animal food and fermented liquor, during\r\nwhich regimen all his complaints increased; he now became emaciated, and\r\ntotally lost his appetite; his pulse very irregular both in velocity and\r\nstrength; with great difficulty of breathing, and some swelling of his\r\nlegs; yet he could lie down horizontally in his bed, though he got little\r\nsleep, and passed a due quantity of urine, and of the natural colour: no\r\nfullness or hardness could be perceived about the region of the liver; and\r\nhe had no pain or numbness in his arms.\r\n\r\nOne night he had a most profuse sweat all over his body and limbs, which\r\nquite deluged his bed, and for a day or two somewhat relieved his\r\ndifficulty of breathing, and his pulse became less irregular: this copious\r\nsweat recurred three or four times at the intervals of five or six days,\r\nand repeatedly alleviated his symptoms.\r\n\r\nHe was directed one large spoonful of the above decoction of foxglove every\r\nhour, till it procured some considerable evacuation: after he had taken it\r\neleven successive hours he had a few liquid stools, attended with a great\r\nflow of urine, which last had a dark tinge, as if mixed with a few drops of\r\nblood: he continued sick at intervals for two days, but his breath became\r\nquite easy, and his pulse quite regular, the swelling of his legs\r\ndisappeared, and his appetite and sleep returned.\r\n\r\nHe then took three grains of white vitriol twice a day, with some bitter\r\nmedicines, and a grain of opium with five grains of rhubarb every night;\r\nwas advised to eat flesh meat, and spice, as his stomach would bear it,\r\nwith small beer, and a few glasses of wine; and had issues made in his\r\nthighs; and has suffered no relapse.\r\n\r\n4. A lady, about fifty years of age, had for some weeks great difficulty of\r\nbreathing, with very irregular pulse, and considerable general debility:\r\nshe could lie down in bed, and the urine was in due quantity and of the\r\nnatural colour, and she had no pain or numbness of her arms.\r\n\r\nShe took one large spoonful of the above decoction of foxglove every hour,\r\nfor ten or twelve successive hours; was sick, and made a quantity of pale\r\nurine for about two days, and was quite relieved both of the difficulty of\r\nbreathing, and the irregularity of her pulse. She then took a grain of\r\nopium, and five grains of rhubarb, every night, night, for many weeks; with\r\nsome slight chalybeate and bitter medicines, and has suffered no relapse.\r\n\r\n_Hydrops Thoracis._\r\n\r\n5. A tradesman, about fifty years of age, became weak and short of breath,\r\nespecially on increase of motion, with pain in one arm, about the insertion\r\nof the biceps muscle. He observed he sometimes in the night made an unusual\r\nquantity of pale water. He took calomel, alum, and peruvian bark, and all\r\nhis symptoms increased: his legs began to swell considerably; his breath\r\nbecame more difficult, and he could not lie down in bed; but all this time\r\nhe made a due quantity of straw-coloured water.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of foxglove was given as in the preceding cases, which\r\noperated chiefly by purging, and seemed to relieve his breath for a day or\r\ntwo; but also seemed to contribute to weaken him.--He became after some\r\nweeks universally dropsical, and died comatous.\r\n\r\n6. A young lady of delicate constitution, with light eyes and hair, and who\r\nhad perhaps lived too abstemiously both in respect to the quantity and\r\nquality of what she eat and drank, was seized with great difficulty of\r\nbreathing, so as to threaten immediate death. Her extremities were quite\r\ncold, and her breath felt cold to the back of one's hand. She had no sweat,\r\nnor could be down for a single moment; and had previously, and at present,\r\ncomplained of great weakness and pain and numbness of both her arms; had no\r\nswelling of her legs, no thirst, water in due quantity and colour. Her\r\nsister, about a year before, was afflicted with similar symptoms, was\r\nrepeatedly blooded, and died universally dropsical.\r\n\r\nA grain of opium was given immediately, and repeated every six hours with\r\nevident and amazing advantage; afterwards a blister, with chalybeates,\r\nbitters, and essential oils, were exhibited, but nothing had such eminent\r\neffect in relieving the difficulty of breathing and coldness of her\r\nextremities as opium, by the use of which in a few weeks she perfectly\r\nregained her health, and has suffered no relapse.\r\n\r\n_Ascites._\r\n\r\n7. A young lady of delicate constitution having been exposed to great fear,\r\ncold, and fatigue, by the overturn of a chaise in the night, began with\r\npain and tumour in the right hypochondrium: in a few months a fluctuation\r\nwas felt throughout the whole abdomen, more distinctly perceptible indeed\r\nabout the region of the stomach; since the integuments of the lower part of\r\nthe abdomen generally become thickened in this disease by a degree of\r\nanasarca. Her legs were not swelled, no thirst, water in due quantity and\r\ncolour.--She took the foxglove so as to induce sickness and stools, but\r\nwithout abating the swelling, and was obliged at length to submit to the\r\noperation of tapping.\r\n\r\n8. A man about sixty-seven, who had long been accustomed to spirituous\r\npotation, had some time laboured under ascites; his legs somewhat swelled;\r\nhis breath easy in all attitudes; no appetite; great thirst; urine in\r\nexceedingly small quantity, very deep coloured, and turbid; pulse equal. He\r\ntook the foxglove in such quantity as vomited him, and induced sickness for\r\ntwo days; but procured no flow of urine, or diminution of his swelling; but\r\nwas thought to leave him considerably weaker.\r\n\r\n9. A corpulent man, accustomed to large potation of fermented liquors, had\r\nvehement cough, difficult breathing, anasarca of his legs, thighs, and\r\nhands, and considerable tumour, with evident fluctuation of his abdomen;\r\nhis pulse was equal; his urine in small quantity, of deep colour, and\r\nturbid. These swellings had been twice considerably abated by drastic\r\ncathartics. He took three ounces of a decoction of foxglove (made by\r\nboiling one ounce of the fresh leaves in a pint of water) every three\r\nhours, for two whole days; it then began to vomit and purge him violently,\r\nand promoted a great flow of urine; he was by these evacuations completely\r\nemptied in twelve hours. After two or three months all these symptoms\r\nreturned, and were again relieved by the use of the foxglove; and thus in\r\nthe space of about three years he was about ten times evacuated, and\r\ncontinued all that time his usual potations: excepting at first, the\r\nmedicine operated only by urine, and did not appear considerably to weaken\r\nhim--The last time he took it, it had no effect; and a few weeks afterwards\r\nhe vomited a great quantity of blood, and expired.\r\n\r\nQUERIES.\r\n\r\n1. As the first six of these patients had a due discharge of urine, and of\r\nthe natural colour, was not the feat of the disease confined to some part\r\nof the thorax, and the swelling of the legs rather a symptom of the\r\nobstructed circulation of the blood, than of a paralysis of the cellular\r\nlymphatics of those parts?\r\n\r\n2. When the original disease is a general anasarca, do not the cutaneous\r\nlymphatics always become paralytic at the same time with the cellular ones,\r\nby their greater sympathy with each other? and hence the paucity of urine,\r\nand the great thirst, distinguish this kind of dropsy?\r\n\r\n3. In the anasarca of the lungs, when the disease is not very great, though\r\nthe patients have considerable difficulty of breathing at their first lying\r\ndown, yet after a minute or two their breath becomes easy again; and the\r\nsame occurs at their first rising. Is not this owing to the time necessary\r\nfor the fluid in the cells of the lungs to change its place, so as the\r\nleast to incommode respiration in the new attitude?\r\n\r\n4. In the dropsy of the pericardium does not the patient bear the\r\nhorizontal or perpendicular attitude with equal ease? Does this\r\ncircumstance distinguish the dropsy of the pericardium from that of the\r\nlungs and of the thorax?\r\n\r\n5. Do the universal sweats distinguish the dropsy of the pericardium, or of\r\nthe thorax? and those, which cover the upper parts of the body only, the\r\nanasarca of the lungs?\r\n\r\n6. When in the dropsy of the thorax, the patient endeavours to lie down,\r\ndoes not the extravasated fluid compress the upper parts of the bronchia,\r\nand totally preclude the access of air to every part of the lungs; whilst\r\nin the perpendicular attitude the inferior parts of the lungs only are\r\ncompressed? Does not something similar to this occur in the anasarca of the\r\nlungs, when the disease is very great, and thus prevent those patients also\r\nfrom lying down?\r\n\r\n7. As a principal branch of the fourth cervical nerve of the left side,\r\nafter having joined a branch of the third and of the second cervical\r\nnerves, descending between the subclavian vein and artery, is received in a\r\ngroove formed for it in the pericardium, and is obliged to make a\r\nconsiderable turn outwards to go over the prominent part of it, where the\r\npoint of the heart is lodged, in its course to the diaphragm; and as the\r\nother phrenic nerve of the right side has a straight course to the\r\ndiaphragm; and as many other considerable branches of this fourth pair of\r\ncervical nerves are spread on the arms; does not a pain in the left arm\r\ndistinguish a disease of the pericardium, as in the angina pectoris, or in\r\nthe dropsy of the pericardium? and does not a pain or weakness in both arms\r\ndistinguish the dropsy of the thorax?\r\n\r\n8. Do not the dropsies of the thorax and pericardium frequently exist\r\ntogether, and thus add to the uncertainty and fatality of the disease?\r\n\r\n9. Might not the foxglove be serviceable in hydrocephalus internus, in\r\nhydrocele, and in white swellings of the joints?\r\n\r\nVI. _Of cold Sweats._\r\n\r\nThere have been histories given of chronical immoderate sweatings, which\r\nbear some analogy to the diabetes. Dr. Willis mentions a lady then living,\r\nwhose sweats where for many years so profuse, that all her bed-clothes were\r\nnot only moistened, but deluged with them every night; and that many\r\nounces, and sometimes pints, of this sweat, were received in vessels\r\nproperly placed, as it trickled down her body. He adds, that she had great\r\nthirst, had taken many medicines, and submitted to various rules of life,\r\nand changes of climate, but still continued to have these immoderate\r\nsweats. Pharmac. ration. de sudore anglico.\r\n\r\nDr. Willis has also observed, that the sudor anglicanus which appeared in\r\nEngland, in 1483, and continued till 1551, was in some respects similar to\r\nthe diabetes; and as Dr. Caius, who saw this disease, mentions the\r\nviscidity, as well as the quantity of these sweats, and adds, that the\r\nextremities were often cold, when the internal parts were burnt up with\r\nheat and thirst, with great and speedy emaciation and debility: there is\r\ngreat reason to believe, that the fluids were absorbed from the cells of\r\nthe body by the cellular and cystic branches of the lymphatics, and poured\r\non the skin by the retrograde motions of the cutaneous ones.\r\n\r\nSydenham has recorded, in the stationary fever of the year 1685, the viscid\r\nsweats flowing from the head, which were probably from the same source as\r\nthose in the sweating plague above mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is very common in dropsies of the chest or lungs to have the difficulty\r\nof breathing relieved by copious sweats, flowing from the head and neck.\r\nMr. P. about 50 years of age, had for many weeks been afflicted with\r\nanasarca of his legs and thighs, attended with difficulty of breathing; and\r\nhad repeatedly been relieved by squill, other bitters, and\r\nchalybeates.--One night the difficulty of breathing became so great, that\r\nit was thought he must have expired; but so copious a sweat came out of his\r\nhead and neck, that in a few hours some pints, by estimation, were wiped\r\noff from those parts, and his breath was for a time relieved. This dyspnoea\r\nand these sweats recurred at intervals, and after some weeks he ceased to\r\nexist. The skin of his head and neck felt cold to the hand, and appeared\r\npale at the time these sweats flowed so abundantly; which is a proof, that\r\nthey were produced by an inverted motion of the absorbents of those parts:\r\nfor sweats, which are the consequence of an increased action of the\r\nsanguiferous system, are always attended with a warmth of the skin, greater\r\nthan is natural, and a more florid colour; as the sweats from exercise, or\r\nthose that succeed the cold fits of agues. Can any one explain how these\r\npartial sweats should relieve the difficulty of breathing in anasarca, but\r\nby supposing that the pulmonary branch of absorbents drank up the fluid in\r\nthe cavity of the thorax, or in the cells of the lungs, and threw it on the\r\nskin, by the retrograde motions of the cutaneous branch? for, if we could\r\nsuppose, that the increased action of the cutaneous glands or capillaries\r\npoured upon the skin this fluid, previously absorbed from the lungs; why is\r\nnot the whole surface of the body covered with sweat? why is not the skin\r\nwarm? Add to this, that the sweats above mentioned were clammy or\r\nglutinous, which the condensed perspirable matter is not; whence it would\r\nseem to have been a different fluid from that of common perspiration.\r\n\r\nDr. Dobson, of Liverpool, has given a very ingenious explanation of the\r\nacid sweats, which he observed in a diabetic patient--he thinks part of the\r\nchyle is secreted by the skin, and afterwards undergoes an acetous\r\nfermentation.--Can the chyle get thither, but by an inverted motion of the\r\ncutaneous lymphatics? in the same manner as it is carried to the bladder,\r\nby the inverted motions of the urinary lymphatics. Medic. Observat. and\r\nEnq. London, vol. v.\r\n\r\nAre not the cold sweats in some fainting fits, and in dying people, owing\r\nto an inverted motion of the cutaneous lymphatics? for in these there can\r\nbe no increased arterial or glandular action.\r\n\r\nIs the difficulty of breathing, arising from anasarca of the lungs,\r\nrelieved by sweats from the head and neck; whilst that difficulty of\r\nbreathing, which arises from a dropsy of the thorax, or pericardium, is\r\nnever attended with these sweats of the head? and thence can these diseases\r\nbe distinguished from each other? Do the periodic returns of nocturnal\r\nasthma rise from a temporary dropsy of the lungs, collected during their\r\nmore torpid state in sound deep, and then re-absorbed by the vehement\r\nefforts of the disordered organs of respiration, and carried off by the\r\ncopious sweats about the head and neck?\r\n\r\nMore extensive and accurate dissections of the lymphatic system are wanting\r\nto enable us to unravel these knots of science.\r\n\r\nVII. _Translations of Matter, of Chyle, of Milk, of Urine. Operation of\r\npurging Drugs applied externally._\r\n\r\n1. The translations of matter from one part of the body to another, can\r\nonly receive an explanation from the doctrine of the occasional retrograde\r\nmotions of some branches of the lymphatic system: for how can matter,\r\nabsorbed and mixed with the whole mass of blood, be so hastily collected\r\nagain in any one part? and is it not an immutable law, in animal bodies,\r\nthat each gland can secrete no other, but its own proper fluid? which is,\r\nin part, fabricated in the very gland by an animal process, which it there\r\nundergoes: of these purulent translations innumerable and very remarkable\r\ninstances are recorded.\r\n\r\n2. The chyle, which is seen among the materials thrown up by violent\r\nvomiting, or in purging stools, can only come thither by its having been\r\npoured into the bowels by the inverted motions of the lacteals: for our\r\naliment is not converted into chyle in the stomach or intestines by a\r\nchemical process, but is made in the very mouths of the lacteals; or in the\r\nmesenteric glands; in the same manner as other secreted fluids are made by\r\nan animal process in their adapted glands.\r\n\r\nHere a curious phænomenon in the exhibition of mercury is worth\r\nexplaining:--If a moderate dose of calomel, as six or ten grains, be\r\nswallowed, and within one or two days a cathartic is given, a salivation is\r\nprevented: but after three or four days, a salivation having come on,\r\nrepeated purges every day, for a week or two, are required to eliminate the\r\nmercury from the constitution. For this acrid metallic preparation, being\r\nabsorbed by the mouth of the lacteals, continues, for a time arrested by\r\nthe mesenteric glands, (as the variolous or venereal poisons swell the\r\nsubaxillar or inguinal glands): which, during the operation of a cathartic,\r\nis returned into the intestines by the inverted action of the lacteals, and\r\nthus carried out of the system.\r\n\r\nHence we understand the use of vomits or purges, to those who have\r\nswallowed either contagious or poisonous materials, even though exhibited a\r\nday or even two days after such accidents; namely, that by the retrograde\r\nmotions of the lacteals and lymphatics, the material still arrested in the\r\nmesenteric, or other glands, may be eliminated from the body.\r\n\r\n3. Many instances of milk and chyle found in ulcers are given by Haller,\r\nEl. Physiol. t. vii. p. 12, 23, which admit of no other explanation than by\r\nsupposing, that the chyle, imbibed by one branch of the absorbent system,\r\nwas carried to the ulcer, by the inverted motions of another branch of the\r\nsame system.\r\n\r\n4. Mrs. P. on the second day after delivery, was seized with a violent\r\npurging, in which, though opiates, mucilages, the bark, and testacea were\r\nprofusely used, continued many days, till at length she recovered. During\r\nthe time of this purging, no milk could be drawn from her breasts; but the\r\nstools appeared like the curd of milk broken into small pieces. In this\r\ncase, was not the milk taken up from the follicles of the pectoral glands,\r\nand thrown on the intestines, by a retrogression of the intestinal\r\nabsorbents? for how can we for a moment suspect that the mucous glands of\r\nthe intestines could separate pure milk from the blood? Doctor Smelly has\r\nobserved, that loose stools, mixed with milk, which is curdled in the\r\nintestines, frequently relieves the turgescency of the breasts of those who\r\nstudiously repel their milk. Cases in Midwifery, 43, No. 2. 1.\r\n\r\n5. J.F. Meckel observed in a patient, whose urine was in small quantity and\r\nhigh coloured, that a copious sweat under the arm-pits, of a perfectly\r\nurinous smell, stained the linen; which ceased again when the usual\r\nquantity of urine was discharged by the urethra. Here we must believe from\r\nanalogy, that the urine was first secreted in the kidneys, then re-absorbed\r\nby the increased action of the urinary lymphatics, and lastly carried to\r\nthe axillae by the retrograde motions of the lymphatic branches of those\r\nparts. As in the jaundice it is necessary, that the bile should first be\r\nsecreted by the liver, and re-absorbed into the circulation, to produce the\r\nyellowness of the skin; as was formerly demonstrated by the late Dr. Munro,\r\n(Edin. Medical Essays) and if in this patient the urine had been\r\nre-absorbed into the mass of blood, as the bile in the jaundice, why was it\r\nnot detected in other parts of the body, as well as in the arm-pits?\r\n\r\n6. Cathartic and vermifuge medicines applied externally to the abdomen,\r\nseem to be taken up by the cutaneous branch of lymphatics, and poured on\r\nthe intestines by the retrograde motions of the lacteals, without having\r\npassed the circulation.\r\n\r\nFor when the drastic purges are taken by the mouth, they excite the\r\nlacteals of the intestines into retrograde motions, as appears from the\r\nchyle, which is found coagulated among the fæces, as was shewn above,\r\n(sect. 2 and 4.) And as the cutaneous lymphatics are joined with the\r\nlacteals of the intestines, by frequent anastomoses; it would be more\r\nextraordinary, when a strong purging drug, absorbed by the skin, is carried\r\nto the anastomosing branches of the lacteals unchanged, if it should not\r\nexcite them into retrograde action as efficaciously, as if it was taken by\r\nthe mouth, and mixed with the food of the stomach.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Circumstances by which the Fluids, that are effused by the\r\nretrograde Motions of the absorbent Vessels, are distinguished._\r\n\r\n1. We frequently observe an unusual quantity of mucus or other fluids in\r\nsome diseases, although the action of the glands, by which those fluids are\r\nseparated from the blood, is not unusually increased; but when the power of\r\nabsorption alone is diminished. Thus the catarrhal humour from the nostrils\r\nof some, who ride in frosty weather; and the tears, which run down the\r\ncheeks of those, who have an obstruction of the puncta lacrymalia; and the\r\nichor of those phagedenic ulcers, which are not attended with inflammation,\r\nare all instances of this circumstance.\r\n\r\nThese fluids however are easily distinguished from others by their\r\nabounding in ammoniacal or muriatic salts; whence they inflame the\r\ncircumjacent skin: thus in the catarrh the upper lip becomes red and\r\nswelled from the acrimony of the mucus, and patients complain of the\r\nsaltness of its taste. The eyes and cheeks are red with the corrosive\r\ntears, and the ichor of some herpetic eruptions erodes far and wide the\r\ncontiguous parts, and is pungently salt to the taste, as some patients have\r\ninformed me.\r\n\r\nWhilst, on the contrary, those fluids, which are effused by the retrograde\r\naction of the lymphatics, are for the most part mild and innocent; as\r\nwater, chyle, and the natural mucus: or they take their properties from the\r\nmaterials previously absorbed, as in the coloured or vinous urine, or that\r\nscented with asparagus, described before.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever the secretion of any fluid is increased, there is at the same\r\ntime an increased heat in the part; for the secreted fluid, as the bile,\r\ndid not previously exist in the mass of blood, but a new combination is\r\nproduced in the gland. Now as solutions are attended with cold, so\r\ncombinations are attended with heat; and it is probable the sum of the heat\r\ngiven out by all the secreted fluids of animal bodies may be the cause of\r\ntheir general heat above that of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHence the fluids derived from increased secretions are readily\r\ndistinguished from those originating from the retrograde motions of the\r\nlymphatics: thus an increase of heat either in the diseased parts, or\r\ndiffused over the whole body, is perceptible, when copious bilious stools\r\nare consequent to an inflamed liver; or a copious mucous salivation from\r\nthe inflammatory angina.\r\n\r\n3. When any secreted fluid is produced in an unusual quantity, and at the\r\nsame time the power of absorption is increased in equal proportion, not\r\nonly the heat of the gland becomes more intense, but the secreted fluid\r\nbecomes thicker and milder, its thinner and saline parts being re-absorbed:\r\nand these are distinguishable both by their greater consistence, and by\r\ntheir heat, from the fluids, which are effused by the retrograde motions of\r\nthe lymphatics; as is observable towards the termination of gonorrhoea,\r\ncatarrh, chincough, and in those ulcers, which are said to abound with\r\nlaudable pus.\r\n\r\n4. When chyle is observed in stools, or among the materials ejected by\r\nvomit, we may be confident it must have been brought thither by the\r\nretrograde motions of the lacteals; for chyle does not previously exist\r\namid the contents of the intestines, but is made in the very mouths of the\r\nlacteals, as was before explained.\r\n\r\n5. When chyle, milk, or other extraneous fluids are found in the urinary\r\nbladder, or in any other excretory receptacle of a gland; no one can for a\r\nmoment believe, that these have been collected from the mass of blood by a\r\nmorbid secretion, as it contradicts all analogy.\r\n\r\n                  ---- Aurea duræ\r\n  Mala ferant quercus? Narcisco floreat alnus?\r\n  Pinguia corticibus sudent electra myricæ?--VIRGIL.\r\n\r\nIX. _Retrograde Motions of Vegetable juices._\r\n\r\nThere are besides some motions of the sap in vegetables, which bear analogy\r\nto our present subject; and as the vegetable tribes are by many\r\nphilosophers held to be inferior animals, it may be a matter of curiosity\r\nat least to observe, that their absorbent vessels seem evidently, at times,\r\nto be capable of a retrograde motion. Mr. Perault cut off a forked branch\r\nof a tree, with the leaves on; and inverting one of the forks into a vessel\r\nof water, observed, that the leaves on the other branch continued green\r\nmuch longer than those of a similar branch, cut off from the same tree;\r\nwhich shews, that the water from the vessel was carried up one part of the\r\nforked branch, by the retrograde motion of its vessels, and supplied\r\nnutriment some time to the other part of the branch, which was out of the\r\nwater. And the celebrated Dr. Hales found, by numerous very accurate\r\nexperiments, that the sap of trees rose upwards during the warmer hours of\r\nthe day, and in part descended again during the cooler ones. Vegetable\r\nStatics.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the branches of willows, and of many other trees,\r\nwill either take root in the earth or engraft on other trees, so as to have\r\ntheir natural direction inverted, and yet flourish with vigour.\r\n\r\nDr. Hope has also made this pleasing experiment, after the manner of\r\nHales--he has placed a forked branch, cut from one tree, erect between two\r\nothers; then cutting off a part of the bark from one fork applied it to a\r\nsimilar branch of one of the trees in its vicinity; and the same of the\r\nother fork; so that a tree is seen to grow suspended in the air, between\r\ntwo other trees; which supply their softer friend with due nourishment.\r\n\r\n  Miranturque novas frondes, et non sua poma.\r\n\r\nAll these experiments clearly evince, that the juices of vegetables can\r\noccasionally pass either upwards or downwards in their absorbent system of\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nX. _Objections answered._\r\n\r\nThe following experiment, at first view, would seem to invalidate this\r\nopinion of the retrograde motions of the lymphatic vessels, in some\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nAbout a gallon of milk having been giving to an hungry swine, he was\r\nsuffered to live about an hour, and was then killed by a stroke or two on\r\nhis head with an axe.--On opening his belly the lacteals were well seen\r\nfilled with chyle; on irritating many of the branches of them with a knife,\r\nthey did not appear to empty themselves hastily; but they did however carry\r\nforwards their contents in a little time.\r\n\r\nI then passed a ligature round several branches of lacteals, and irritated\r\nthem much with a knife beneath the ligature, but could not make them\r\nregurgitate their contained fluid into the bowels.\r\n\r\nI am not indeed certain, that the nerve was not at the same time included\r\nin the ligature, and thus the lymphatic rendered unirritable or lifeless;\r\nbut this however is certain, that it is not any quantity of any stimulus,\r\nwhich induces the vessels of animal bodies to revert their motions; but a\r\ncertain quantity of a certain stimulus, as appears from wounds in the\r\nstomach, which do not produce vomiting; and wounds of the intestines, which\r\ndo not produce the cholera morbus.\r\n\r\nAt Nottingham, a few years ago, two shoemakers quarrelled, and one of them\r\nwith a knife, which they use in their occupation, stabbed his companion\r\nabout the region of the stomach. On opening the abdomen of the wounded man\r\nafter his death the food and medicines he had taken were in part found in\r\nthe cavity of the belly, on the outside of the bowels; and there was a\r\nwound about half an inch long at the bottom of the stomach; which I suppose\r\nwas distended with liquor and food at the time of the accident; and thence\r\nwas more liable to be injured at its bottom: but during the whole time he\r\nlived, which was about ten days, he had no efforts to vomit, nor ever even\r\ncomplained of being sick at the stomach! Other cases similar to this are\r\nmentioned in the philosophical transactions.\r\n\r\nThus, if you vellicate the throat with a feather, nausea is produced; if\r\nyou wound it with a penknife, pain is induced, but not sickness. So if the\r\nsoles of the feet of children or their armpits are tickled, convulsive\r\nlaughter is excited, which ceases the moment the hand is applied, so as to\r\nrub them more forcibly.\r\n\r\nThe experiment therefore above related upon the lacteals of a dead pig,\r\nwhich were included in a strict ligature, proves nothing; as it is not the\r\nquantity, but the kind of stimulus, which excites the lymphatic vessels\r\ninto retrograde motion.\r\n\r\nXI. _The Causes which induce the retrograde Motions of animal Vessels; and\r\nthe Medicines by which the natural Motions are restored._\r\n\r\n1. Such is the construction of animal bodies, that all their parts, which\r\nare subjected to less stimuli than nature designed, perform their functions\r\nwith less accuracy: thus, when too watery or too acescent food is taken\r\ninto the stomach, indigestion, and flatulency, and heartburn succeed.\r\n\r\n2. Another law of irritation, connate with our existence, is, that all\r\nthose parts of the body, which have previously been exposed to too great a\r\nquantity of such stimuli, as strongly affect them, become for some time\r\nafterwards disobedient to the natural quantity of their adapted\r\nstimuli.--Thus the eye is incapable of seeing objects in an obscure room,\r\nthough the iris is quite dilated, after having been exposed to the meridian\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n3. There is a third law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies,\r\nwhich have been lately subjected to less stimulus, than they have been\r\naccustomed to, when they are exposed to their usual quantity of stimulus,\r\nare excited into more energetic motions: thus when we come from a dusky\r\ncavern into the glare of daylight, our eyes are dazzled; and after emerging\r\nfrom the cold bath, the skin becomes warm and red.\r\n\r\n4. There is a fourth law of irritation, that all the parts of our bodies,\r\nwhich are subjected to still stronger stimuli for a length of time, become\r\ntorpid, and refuse to obey even these stronger stimuli; and thence do their\r\noffices very imperfectly.--Thus, if any one looks earnestly for some\r\nminutes on an area, an inch diameter, of red silk, placed on a sheet of\r\nwhite paper, the image of the silk will gradually become pale, and at\r\nlength totally vanish.\r\n\r\n5. Nor is it the nerves of sense alone, as the optic and auditory nerves,\r\nthat thus become torpid, when the stimulus is withdrawn or their\r\nirritability decreased; but the motive muscles, when they are deprived of\r\ntheir natural stimuli, or of their irritability, become torpid and\r\nparalytic; as is seen in the tremulous hand of the drunkard in a morning;\r\nand in the awkward step of age.\r\n\r\nThe hollow muscles also, of which the various vessels of the body are\r\nconstructed, when they are deprived of their natural stimuli, or of their\r\ndue degree of irritability, not only become tremulous, as the arterial\r\npulsations of dying people; but also frequently invert their motions, as in\r\nvomiting, in hysteric suffocations, and diabetes above described.\r\n\r\nI must beg your patient attention, for a few moments whilst I endeavour to\r\nexplain, how the retrograde actions of our hollow muscles are the\r\nconsequence of their debility; as the tremulous actions of the solid\r\nmuscles are the consequence of their debility. When, through fatigue, a\r\nmuscle can act no longer; the antagonist muscles, either by their inanimate\r\nelasticity, or by their animal action, draw the limb into a contrary\r\ndirection: in the solid muscles, as those of locomotion, their actions are\r\nassociated in tribes, which have been accustomed to synchronous action\r\nonly; hence when they are fatigued, only a single contrary effort takes\r\nplace; which is either tremulous, when the fatigued muscles are again\r\nimmediately brought into action; or it is a pandiculation, or stretching,\r\nwhere they are not immediately again brought into action.\r\n\r\nNow the motions of the hollow muscles, as they in general propel a fluid\r\nalong their cavities, are associated in trains, which have been accustomed\r\nto successive actions: hence when one ring of such a muscle is fatigued\r\nfrom its too great debility, and is brought into retrograde action, the\r\nnext ring from its association falls successively into retrograde action;\r\nand so on throughout the whole canal. See Sect. XXV. 6.\r\n\r\n6. But as the retrograde motions of the stomach, oesophagus, and fauces in\r\nvomiting are, as it were, apparent to the eye; we shall consider this\r\noperation more minutely, that the similar operations in the more recondite\r\nparts of our system may be easier understood.\r\n\r\nFrom certain nauseous ideas of the mind, from an ungrateful taste in the\r\nmouth, or from foetid smells, vomiting is sometimes instantly excited; or\r\neven from a stroke on the head, or from the vibratory motions of a ship;\r\nall which originate from association, or sympathy. See Sect. XX. on\r\nVertigo.\r\n\r\nBut when the stomach is subjected to a less stimulus than is natural,\r\naccording to the first law of irritation mentioned above, its motions\r\nbecome disturbed, as in hunger; first pain is produced, then sickness, and\r\nat length vain efforts to vomit, as many authors inform us.\r\n\r\nBut when a great quantity of wine, or of opium, is swallowed, the\r\nretrograde motions of the stomach do not occur till after several minutes,\r\nor even hours; for when the power of so strong a stimulus ceases, according\r\nto the second law of irritation, mentioned above, the peristaltic motions\r\nbecome tremulous, and at length retrograde; as is well known to the\r\ndrunkard, who on the next morning has sickness and vomitings.\r\n\r\nWhen a still greater quantity of wine, or of opium, or when nauseous\r\nvegetables, or strong bitters, or metallic salts, are taken into the\r\nstomach, they quickly induce vomiting; though all these in less doses\r\nexcite the stomach into more energetic action, and strengthen the\r\ndigestion; as the flowers of chamomile, and the vitriol of zinc: for,\r\naccording to the fourth law of irritation, the stomach will not long be\r\nobedient to a stimulus so much greater than is natural; but its action\r\nbecomes first tremulous and then retrograde.\r\n\r\n7. When the motions of any vessels become retrograde, less heat of the body\r\nis produced; for in paroxysms of vomiting, of hysteric affections, of\r\ndiabetes, of asthma, the extremities of the body are cold: hence we may\r\nconclude, that these symptoms arise from the debility of the parts in\r\naction; for an increase of muscular action is always attended with increase\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\n8. But as animal debility is owing to defect of stimulus, or to defect of\r\nirritability, as shewn above, the method of cure is easily deduced: when\r\nthe vascular muscles are not excited into their due action by the natural\r\nstimuli, we should exhibit those medicines, which possess a still greater\r\ndegree of stimulus; amongst these are the foetids, the volatiles,\r\naromatics, bitters, metallic salts, opiates, wine, which indeed should be\r\ngiven in small doses, and frequently repeated. To these should be added\r\nconstant, but moderate exercise, cheerfulness of mind, and change of\r\ncountry to a warmer climate; and perhaps occasionally the external stimulus\r\nof blisters.\r\n\r\nIt is also frequently useful to diminish the quantity of natural stimulus\r\nfor a short time, by which afterwards the irritability of the system\r\nbecomes increased; according to the third law of irritation\r\nabove-mentioned, hence the use of baths somewhat colder than animal heat,\r\nand of equitation in the open air.\r\n\r\n_The catalogue of diseases owing to the retrograde motions of lymphatics is\r\nhere omitted, as it will appear in the second volume of this work. The\r\nfollowing is the conclusion to this thesis of_ Mr. CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\nThus have I endeavoured in a concise manner to explain the numerous\r\ndiseases, which deduce their origin from the inverted motions of the hollow\r\nmuscles of our bodies: and it is probable, that Saint Vitus's dance, and\r\nthe stammering of speech, originate from a similar, inverted order of the\r\nassociated motions of some of the solid muscles; which, as it is foreign to\r\nmy present purpose, I shall not here discuss.\r\n\r\nI beg, illustrious professors, and ingenious fellow-students, that you will\r\nrecollect how difficult a talk I have attempted, to evince the retrograde\r\nmotions of the lymphatic vessels, when the vessels themselves for so many\r\nages escaped the eyes and glasses of philosophers: and if you are not yet\r\nconvinced of the truth of this theory, hold, I entreat you, your minds in\r\nsuspense, till ANATOMY draws her sword with happier omens, cuts asunder the\r\nknots, which entangle PHYSIOLOGY; and, like an augur inspecting the\r\nimmolated victim, announces to mankind the wisdom of HEAVEN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

From the ingurgitation of spirituous liquors into the stomach and\r\nduodenum, the termination of the common bile-duct in that bowel becomes\r\nstimulated into unnatural action, and a greater quantity of bile is\r\nproduced from all the secretory vessels of the liver, by the association of\r\ntheir motions with those of their excretory ducts; as has been explained in\r\nSection XXIV. and XXV. but as all parts of the body, that have been\r\naffected with stronger stimuli for any length of time, become less\r\nsusceptible of motion, from their natural weaker stimuli, it follows, that\r\nthe motions of the secretory vessels, and in consequence the secretion of\r\nbile, is less than is natural during the intervals of sobriety. 2. If this\r\ningurgitation of spirituous liquors has been daily continued in\r\nconsiderable quantity, and is then suddenly intermitted, a languor or\r\nparalysis of the common bile-duct is induced; the bile is prevented from\r\nbeing poured into the intestines; and as the bilious absorbents are\r\nstimulated into stronger action by its accumulation, and by the acrimony or\r\nviscidity, which it acquires by delay, it is absorbed, and carried to the\r\nreceptacle of the chyle; or otherwise the secretory vessels of the liver,\r\nby the above-mentioned stimulus, invert their motions, and regurgitate\r\ntheir contents into the blood, as sometimes happens to the tears in the\r\nlachrymal sack, see Sect. XXIV. 2. 7. and one kind of jaundice is brought\r\non.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe, that the bile is most frequently returned into\r\nthe circulation by the inverted motions of these hepatic glands, for the\r\nbile does not seem liable to be absorbed by the lymphatics, for it soaks\r\nthrough the gall-ducts, and is frequently found in the cellular membrane.\r\nThis kind of jaundice is not generally attended with pain, neither at the\r\nextremity of the bile-duct, where it enters the duodenum, nor on the region\r\nof the gall-bladder.\r\n\r\nMr. S. a gentleman between 40 and 50 years of age, had had the jaundice\r\nabout six weeks, without pain, sickness, or fever; and had taken emetics,\r\ncathartics, mercurials, bitters, chalybeates, essential oil, and ether,\r\nwithout apparent advantage. On a supposition that the obstruction of the\r\nbile might be owing to the paralysis, or torpid action of the common\r\nbile-duct, and the stimulants taken into the stomach seeming to have no\r\neffect, I directed half a score smart electric shocks from a coated bottle,\r\nwhich held about a quart, to be passed through the liver, and along the\r\ncourse of the common gall-duct, as near as could be guessed, and on that\r\nvery day the stools became yellow; he continued the electric shocks a few\r\ndays more, and his skin gradually became clear.\r\n\r\n3. The bilious vomiting and purging, that affects some people by intervals\r\nof a few weeks, is a less degree of this disease; the bile-duct is less\r\nirritable than natural, and hence the bile becomes accumulated in the\r\ngall-bladder, and hepatic ducts, till by its quantity, acrimony or\r\nviscidity, a greater degree of irritation is produced, and it is suddenly\r\nevacuated, or lastly from the absorption of the more liquid parts of the\r\nbile, the remainder becomes inspissated, and chrystallizes into masses too\r\nlarge to pass, and forms another kind of jaundice, where the bile-duct is\r\nnot quite paralytic, or has regained its irritability.\r\n\r\nThis disease is attended with much pain, which at first is felt at the pit\r\nof the stomach, exactly in the centre of the body, where the bile-duct\r\nenters the duodenum; afterwards, when the size of the bile-stones increase,\r\nit is also felt on the right side, where the gall-bladder is situated. The\r\nformer pain at the pit of the stomach recurs by intervals, as the\r\nbile-stone is pushed against the neck of the duct; like the paroxysms of\r\nthe stone in the urinary bladder, the other is a more dull and constant\r\npain.\r\n\r\nWhere these bile-stones are too large to pass, and the bile-ducts possess\r\ntheir sensibility, this becomes a very painful and hopeless disease. I made\r\nthe following experiments with a view to their chemical solution.\r\n\r\nSome fragments of the same bile-stone were put into the weak spirit of\r\nmarine salt, which is sold in the shops, and into solution of mild alcali;\r\nand into a solution of caustic alcali; and into oil of turpentine; without\r\ntheir being dissolved. All these mixtures were after some time put into a\r\nheat of boiling water, and then the oil of turpentine dissolved its\r\nfragments of bile-stone, but no alteration was produced upon those in the\r\nother liquids except some change of their colour.\r\n\r\nSome fragments of the same bile-stone were put into vitriolic æther, and\r\nwere quickly dissolved without additional heat. Might not æther mixed with\r\nyolk of egg or with honey be given advantageously in bilious concretions?\r\n\r\nI have in two instances seen from 30 to 50 bile-stones come away by stool,\r\nabout the size of large peas, after having given six grains of calomel in\r\nthe evening, and four ounces of oil of almonds or olives on the succeeding\r\nmorning. I have also given half a pint of good olive or almond oil as an\r\nemetic during the painful fit, and repeated it in half an hour, if the\r\nfirst did not operate, with frequent good effect.\r\n\r\n4. Another disease of the liver, which I have several times observed,\r\nconsists in the inability or paralysis of the secretory vessels. This\r\ndisease has generally the same cause as the preceding one, the too frequent\r\npotation of spirituous liquors, or the too sudden omission of them, after\r\nthe habit is confined; and is greater or less in proportion, as the whole\r\nor a part of the liver is affected, and as the inability or paralysis is\r\nmore or less complete.\r\n\r\nThis palsy of the liver is known from these symptoms, the patients have\r\ngenerally passed the meridian of life, have drank fermented liquors daily,\r\nbut perhaps not been opprobrious drunkards; they lose their appetite, then\r\ntheir flesh and strength diminish in consequence, there appears no bile in\r\ntheir stools, nor in their urine, nor is any hardness or swelling\r\nperceptible on the region of the liver. But what is peculiar to this\r\ndisease, and distinguishes it from all others at the first glance of the\r\neye, is the bombycinous colour of the skin, which, like that of full-grown\r\nsilkworms, has a degree of transparency with a yellow tint not greater than\r\nis natural to the serum of the blood.\r\n\r\nMr. C. and Mr. B. both very strong men, between 50 and 60 years of age, who\r\nhad drank ale at their meals instead of small beer, but were not reputed\r\nhard-drinkers, suddenly became weak, lost their appetite, flesh, and\r\nstrength, with all the symptoms above enumerated, and died in about two\r\nmonths from the beginning of their malady. Mr. C. became anasarcous a few\r\ndays before his death, and Mr. B. had frequent and great hæmorrhages from\r\nan issue, and some parts of his mouth, a few days before his death. In both\r\nthese cases calomel, bitters and chalybeates were repeatedly used without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nOne of the patients described above, Mr. C, was by trade a plumber; both of\r\nthem could digest no food, and died apparently for want of blood. Might not\r\nthe transfusion of blood be used in these cases with advantage?\r\n\r\n5. When the paralysis of the hepatic glands is less complete, or less\r\nuniversal, a schirrosity of some part of the liver is induced; for the\r\nsecretory vessels retaining some of their living power take up a fluid from\r\nthe circulation, without being sufficiently irritable to carry it forwards\r\nto their excretory ducts; hence the body, or receptacle of each gland,\r\nbecomes inflated, and this distension increases, till by its very great\r\nstimulus inflammation is produced, or till those parts of the viscus become\r\ntotally paralytic. This disease is distinguishable from the foregoing by\r\nthe palpable hardness or largeness of the liver; and as the hepatic glands\r\nare not totally paralytic, or the whole liver not affected, some bile\r\ncontinues to be made. The inflammations of this viscus, consequent to the\r\nschirrosity of it, belong to the diseases of the sensitive motions, and\r\nwill be treated of hereafter.\r\n\r\n6. The ancients are said to have possessed an art of increasing the livers\r\nof geese to a size greater than the remainder of the goose. Martial. l. 13.\r\nepig. 58.--This is said to have been done by fat and figs. Horace, l. 2.\r\nsat. 8.--Juvenal sets these large livers before an epicure as a great\r\nrarity. Sat. 5. l. 114; and Persius, sat. 6. l. 71. Pliny says these large\r\ngoose-livers were soaked in mulled milk, that is, I suppose, milk mixed\r\nwith honey and wine; and adds, \"that it is uncertain whether Scipio\r\nMetellus, of consular dignity, or M. Sestius, a Roman knight, was the great\r\ndiscoverer of this excellent dish.\" A modern traveller, I believe Mr.\r\nBrydone, asserts that the art of enlarging the livers of geese still exists\r\nin Sicily; and it is to be lamented that he did not import it into his\r\nnative country, as some method of affecting the human liver might perhaps\r\nhave been collected from it; besides the honour he might have acquired in\r\nimproving our giblet pies.\r\n\r\nOur wiser caupones, I am told, know how to fatten their fowls, as well as\r\ntheir geese, for the London markets, by mixing gin instead of figs and fat\r\nwith their food; by which they are said to become sleepy, and to fatten\r\napace, and probably acquire enlarged livers; as the swine are asserted to\r\ndo, which are fed on the sediments of barrels in the distilleries; and\r\nwhich so frequently obtains in those, who ingurgitate much ale, or wine, or\r\ndrams.\r\n\r\nII. The irritative diseases of the kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and other\r\nglands, are analogous to those of the liver above described, differing only\r\nin the consequences attending their inability to action. For instance, when\r\nthe secretory vessels of the kidneys become disobedient to the stimulus of\r\nthe passing current of blood, no urine is separated or produced by them;\r\ntheir excretory mouths become filled with concreted mucus, or calculus\r\nmatter, and in eight or ten days stupor and death supervenes in consequence\r\nof the retention of the feculent part of the blood.\r\n\r\nThis disease in a slighter degree, or when only a part of the kidney is\r\naffected, is succeeded by partial inflammation of the kidney in consequence\r\nof previous torpor. In that case greater actions of the secretory vessels\r\noccur, and the nucleus of gravel is formed by the inflamed mucous membranes\r\nof the tubuli uriniferi, as farther explained in its place.\r\n\r\nThis torpor, or paralysis of the secretory vessels of the kidneys, like\r\nthat of the liver, owes its origin to their being previously habituated to\r\ntoo great stimulus; which in this country is generally owing to the alcohol\r\ncontained in ale or wine; and hence must be registered amongst the diseases\r\nowing to inebriety; though it may be caused by whatever occasionally\r\ninflames the kidney; as too violent riding on horseback, or the cold from a\r\ndamp bed, or by sleeping on the cold ground; or perhaps by drinking in\r\ngeneral too little aqueous fluids.\r\n\r\nIII. I shall conclude this section on the diseases of the liver induced by\r\nspirituous liquors, with the well known story of Prometheus, which seems\r\nindeed to have been invented by physicians in those ancient times, when all\r\nthings were clothed in hieroglyphic, or in fable. Prometheus was painted as\r\nstealing fire from heaven, which might well represent the inflammable\r\nspirit produced by fermentation; which may be said to animate or enliven\r\nthe man of clay: whence the conquests of Bacchus, as well as the temporary\r\nmirth and noise of his devotees. But the after punishment of those, who\r\nsteal this accursed fire, is a vulture gnawing the liver; and well\r\nallegorises the poor inebriate lingering for years under painful hepatic\r\ndiseases. When the expediency of laying a further tax on the distillation\r\nof spirituous liquors from grain was canvassed before the House of Commons\r\nsome years ago, it was said of the distillers, with great truth, \"_They\r\ntake the bread from the people, and convert it into poison!_\" Yet is this\r\nmanufactory of disease permitted to continue, as appears by its paying into\r\nthe treasury above 900,000l. near a million of money annually. And thus,\r\nunder the names of rum, brandy, gin, whisky, usquebaugh, wine, cyder, beer,\r\nand porter, alcohol is become the bane of the Christian world, as opium of\r\nthe Mahometan.\r\n\r\n          Evoe! parce, liber?\r\n  Parce, gravi metuende thirso!--Hor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

The natives of South-America, and\r\n    brute animals of this temperament._ III. _Of increased voluntarity;\r\n    these are subject to locked jaw, convulsions, epilepsy, mania. Are very\r\n    active, bear cold, hunger, fatigue. Are suited to great exertions. This\r\n    temperament distinguishes mankind from other animals._ IV. _Of\r\n    increased association. These have great memories, are liable to quartan\r\n    agues, and stronger sympathies of parts with each other._ V. _Change of\r\n    temperaments into one another._\r\n\r\nAntient writers have spoken much of temperaments, but without sufficient\r\nprecision. By temperament of the system should be meant a permanent\r\npredisposition to certain classes of diseases: without this definition a\r\ntemporary predisposition to every distinct malady might be termed a\r\ntemperament. There are four kinds of constitution, which permanently\r\ndeviate from good health, and are perhaps sufficiently marked to be\r\ndistinguished from each other, and constitute the temperaments or\r\npredispositions to the irritative, sensitive, voluntary, and associate\r\nclasses of diseases.\r\n\r\nI. _The Temperament of decreased Irritability._\r\n\r\nThe diseases, which are caused by irritation, most frequently originate\r\nfrom the defect of it; for those, which are immediately owing to the excess\r\nof it, as the hot fits of fever, are generally occasioned by an\r\naccumulation of sensorial power in consequence of a previous defect of\r\nirritation, as in the preceding cold fits of fever. Whereas the diseases,\r\nwhich are caused by sensation and volition, most frequently originate from\r\nthe excess of those sensorial powers, as will be explained below.\r\n\r\nThe temperament of decreased irritability appears from the following\r\ncircumstances, which shew that the muscular fibres or organs of sense are\r\nliable to become torpid or quiescent from less defect of stimulation than\r\nis productive of torpor or quiescence in other constitutions.\r\n\r\n1. The first is the weak pulse, which in some constitutions is at the same\r\ntime quick. 2. The next most marked criterion of this temperament is the\r\nlargeness of the aperture of the iris, or pupil of the eye, which has been\r\nreckoned by some a beautiful feature in the female countenance, as an\r\nindication of delicacy, but to an experienced observer it is an indication\r\nof debility, and is therefore a defect, not an excellence. The third most\r\nmarked circumstance in this constitution is, that the extremities, as the\r\nhands and feet, or nose and ears, are liable to become cold and pale in\r\nsituations in respect to warmth, where those of greater strength are not\r\naffected. Those of this temperament are subject to hysteric affections,\r\nnervous fevers, hydrocephalus, scrophula, and consumption, and to all other\r\ndiseases of debility.\r\n\r\nThose, who possess this kind of constitution, are popularly supposed to be\r\nmore irritable than is natural, but are in reality less so.\r\n\r\nThis mistake has arisen from their generally having a greater quickness of\r\npulse, as explained in Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 3.; but this frequency of\r\npulse is not necessary to the temperament, like the debility of it.\r\n\r\nPersons of this temperament are frequently found amongst the softer sex,\r\nand amongst narrow-shouldered men; who are said to bear labour worse, and\r\npain better than others. This last circumstance is supposed to have\r\nprevented the natives of North America from having been made slaves by the\r\nEuropeans. They are a narrow-shouldered race of people, and will rather\r\nexpire under the lash, than be made to labour. Some nations of Asia have\r\nsmall hands, as may be seen by the handles of their scymetars; which with\r\ntheir narrow shoulders shew, that they have not been accustomed to so great\r\nlabour with their hands and arms, as the European nations in agriculture,\r\nand those on the coasts of Africa in swimming and rowing. Dr. Maningham, a\r\npopular accoucheur in the beginning of this century, observes in his\r\naphorisms, that broad-shouldered men procreate broad-shouldered children.\r\nNow as labour strengthens the muscles employed, and increases their bulk,\r\nit would seem that a few generations of labour or of indolence may in this\r\nrespect change the form and temperament of the body.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, those who are happily possessed of a great degree of\r\nirritability, bear labour better than pain; and are strong, active, and\r\ningenious. But there is not properly a temperament of increased\r\nirritability tending to disease, because an increased quantity of\r\nirritative motions generally induces an increase of pleasure or pain, as in\r\nintoxication, or inflammation; and then the new motions are the immediate\r\nconsequences of increased sensation, not of increased irritation; which\r\nhave hence been so perpetually confounded with each other.\r\n\r\nII. _Temperament of Sensibility._\r\n\r\nThere is not properly a temperament, or predisposition to disease, from\r\ndecreased sensibility, since irritability and not sensibility is\r\nimmediately necessary to bodily health. Hence it is the excess of sensation\r\nalone, as it is the defect of irritation, that most frequently produces\r\ndisease. This temperament of increased sensibility is known from the\r\nincreased activity of all those motions of the organs of sense and muscles,\r\nwhich are exerted in consequence of pleasure or pain, as in the beginning\r\nof drunkenness, and in inflammatory fever. Hence those of this constitution\r\nare liable to inflammatory diseases, as hepatitis; and to that kind of\r\nconsumption which is hereditary, and commences with slight repeated\r\nhæmoptoe. They have high-coloured lips, frequently dark hair and dark eyes\r\nwith large pupils, and are in that case subject to gutta serena. They are\r\nliable to enthusiasm, delirium, and reverie. In this last circumstance they\r\nare liable to start at the clapping of a door; because the more intent any\r\none is on the passing current of his ideas, the greater surprise he\r\nexperiences on their being dissevered by some external violence, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XIX. on reverie.\r\n\r\nAs in these constitutions more than the natural quantities of sensitive\r\nmotions are produced by the increased quantity of sensation existing in the\r\nhabit, it follows, that the irritative motions will be performed in some\r\ndegree with less energy, owing to the great expenditure of sensorial power\r\non the sensitive ones. Hence those of this temperament do not attend to\r\nslight stimulations, as explained in Sect. XIX. But when a stimulus is so\r\ngreat as to excite sensation, it produces greater sensitive actions of the\r\nsystem than in others; such as delirium or inflammation. Hence they are\r\nliable to be absent in company; sit or lie long in one posture; and in\r\nwinter have the skin of their legs burnt into various colours by the fire.\r\nHence also they are fearful of pain; covet music and sleep; and delight in\r\npoetry and romance.\r\n\r\nAs the motions in consequence of sensation are more than natural, it also\r\nhappens from the greater expenditure of sensorial power on them, that the\r\nvoluntary motions are less easily exerted. Hence the subjects of this\r\ntemperament are indolent in respect to all voluntary exertions, whether of\r\nmind or body.\r\n\r\nA race of people of this description seems to have been found by the\r\nSpaniards in the islands of America, where they first landed, ten of whom\r\nare said not to have consumed more food than one Spaniard, nor to have been\r\ncapable of more than one tenth of the exertion of a Spaniard. Robertson's\r\nHistory.--In a state similar to this the greatest part of the animal world\r\npass their lives, between sleep or inactive reverie, except when they are\r\nexcited by the call of hunger.\r\n\r\nIII. _The Temperament of increased Voluntarity._\r\n\r\nThose of this constitution differ from both the last mentioned in this,\r\nthat the pain, which gradually subsides in the first, and is productive of\r\ninflammation or delirium in the second, is in this succeeded by the\r\nexertion of the muscles or ideas, which are most frequently connected with\r\nvolition; and they are thence subject to locked jaw, convulsions, epilepsy,\r\nand mania, as explained in Sect. XXXIV. Those of this temperament attend to\r\nthe slightest irritations or sensations, and immediately exert themselves\r\nto obtain or avoid the objects of them; they can at the same time bear cold\r\nand hunger better than others, of which Charles the Twelfth of Sweden was\r\nan instance. They are suited and generally prompted to all great exertions\r\nof genius or labour, as their desires are more extensive and more vehement,\r\nand their powers of attention and of labour greater. It is this facility of\r\nvoluntary exertion, which distinguishes men from brutes, and which has made\r\nthem lords of the creation.\r\n\r\nIV. _The Temperament of increased Association._\r\n\r\nThis constitution consists in the too great facility, with which the\r\nfibrous motions acquire habits of association, and by which these\r\nassociations become proportionably stronger than in those of the other\r\ntemperaments. Those of this temperament are slow in voluntary exertions, or\r\nin those dependent on sensation, or on irritation. Hence great memories\r\nhave been said to be attended with less sense and less imagination from\r\nAristotle down to the present time; for by the word memory these writers\r\nonly understood the unmeaning repetition of words or numbers in the order\r\nthey were received, without any voluntary efforts of the mind.\r\n\r\nIn this temperament those associations of motions, which are commonly\r\ntermed sympathies, act with greater certainty and energy, as those between\r\ndisturbed vision and the inversion of the motion of the stomach, as in\r\nsea-sickness; and the pains in the shoulder from hepatic inflammation. Add\r\nto this, that the catenated circles of actions are of greater extent than\r\nin the other constitutions. Thus if a strong vomit or cathartic be\r\nexhibited in this temperament, a smaller quantity will produce as great an\r\neffect, if it be given some weeks afterwards; whereas in other temperaments\r\nthis is only to be expected, if it be exhibited in a few days after the\r\nfirst dose. Hence quartan agues are formed in those of this temperament, as\r\nexplained in Section XXXII. on diseases from irritation, and other\r\nintermittents are liable to recur from slight causes many weeks after they\r\nhave been cured by the bark.\r\n\r\nV. The first of these temperaments differs from the standard of health from\r\ndefect, and the others from excess of sensorial power; but it sometimes\r\nhappens that the same individual, from the changes introduced into his\r\nhabit by the different seasons of the year, modes or periods of life, or by\r\naccidental diseases, passes from one of these temperaments to another. Thus\r\na long use of too much fermented liquor produces the temperament of\r\nincreased sensibility; great indolence and solitude that of decreased\r\nirritability; and want of the necessaries of life that of increased\r\nvoluntarity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

When the contractile sides of the heart and arteries perform a greater\r\nnumber of pulsations in a given time, and move through a greater area at\r\neach pulsation, whether these motions are occasioned by the stimulus of the\r\nacrimony or quantity of the blood, or by their association with other\r\nirritative motions, or by the increased irritability of the arterial\r\nsystem, that is, by an increased quantity of sensorial power, one kind of\r\nfever is produced; which may be called Synocha irritativa, or Febris\r\nirritativa pulsu forti, or irritative fever with strong pulse.\r\n\r\nWhen the contractile sides of the heart and arteries perform a greater\r\nnumber of pulsations in a given time, but move through a much less area at\r\neach pulsation, whether these motions are occasioned by defect of their\r\nnatural stimuli, or by the defect of other irritative motions with which\r\nthey are associated, or from the inirritability of the arterial system,\r\nthat is, from a decreased quantity of sensorial power, another kind of\r\nfever arises; which may be termed, Typhus irritativus, or Febris irritativa\r\npulsu debili, or irritative fever with weak pulse. The former of these\r\nfevers is the synocha of nosologists, and the latter the typhus mitior, or\r\nnervous fever. In the former there appears to be an increase of sensorial\r\npower, in the latter a deficiency of it; which is shewn to be the immediate\r\ncause of strength and weakness, as defined in Sect. XII. 1. 3.\r\n\r\nIt should be added, that a temporary quantity of strength or debility may\r\nbe induced by the defect or excess of stimulus above what is natural; and\r\nthat in the same fever _debility always exists during the cold fit, though\r\nstrength does not always exist during the hot fit._\r\n\r\nThese fevers are always connected with, and generally induced by, the\r\ndisordered irritative motions of the organs of sense, or of the intestinal\r\ncanal, or of the glandular system, or of the absorbent system; and hence\r\nare always complicated with some or many of these disordered motions, which\r\nare termed the symptoms of the fever, and which compose the great variety\r\nin these diseases.\r\n\r\nThe irritative fevers both with strong and with weak pulse, as well as the\r\nsensitive fevers with strong and with weak pulse, which are to be described\r\nin the next section, are liable to periodical remissions, and then they\r\ntake the name of intermittent fevers, and are distinguished by the\r\nperiodical times of their access.\r\n\r\nII. For the better illustration of the phenomena of irritative fevers we\r\nmust refer the reader to the circumstances of irritation explained in Sect.\r\nXII. and shall commence this intricate subject by speaking of the quick\r\npulse, and proceed by considering many of the causes, which either\r\nseparately or in combination most frequently produce the cold fits of\r\nfevers.\r\n\r\n1. If the arteries are dilated but to half their usual diameters, though\r\nthey contract twice as frequently in a given time, they will circulate only\r\nhalf their usual quantity of blood: for as they are cylinders, the blood\r\nwhich they contain must be as the squares of their diameters. Hence when\r\nthe pulse becomes quicker and smaller in the same proportion, the heart and\r\narteries act with less energy than in their natural state. See Sect. XII.\r\n1. 4.\r\n\r\nThat this quick small pulse is owing to want of irritability, appears,\r\nfirst, because it attends other symptoms of want of irritability; and,\r\nsecondly, because on the application of a stimulus greater than usual, it\r\nbecomes slower and larger. Thus in cold fits of agues, in hysteric\r\npalpitations of the heart, and when the body is much exhausted by\r\nhæmorrhages, or by fatigue, as well as in nervous fevers, the pulse becomes\r\nquick and small; and secondly, in all those cases if an increase of\r\nstimulus be added, by giving a little wine or opium; the quick small pulse\r\nbecomes slower and larger, as any one may easily experience on himself, by\r\ncounting his pulse after drinking one or two glasses of wine, when he is\r\nfaint from hunger or fatigue.\r\n\r\nNow nothing can so strongly evince that this quick small pulse is owing to\r\ndefect of irritability, than that an additional stimulus, above what is\r\nnatural, makes it become slower and larger immediately: for what is meant\r\nby a defect of irritability, but that the arteries and heart are not\r\nexcited into their usual exertions by their usual quantity of stimulus? but\r\nif you increase the quantity of stimulus, and they immediately act with\r\ntheir usual energy, this proves their previous want of their natural degree\r\nof irritability. Thus the trembling hands of drunkards in a morning become\r\nsteady, and acquire strength to perform their usual offices, by the\r\naccustomed stimulus of a glass or two of brandy.\r\n\r\n2. In sleep and in apoplexy the pulse becomes slower, which is not owing to\r\ndefect of irritability, for it is at the same time larger; and thence the\r\nquantity of the circulation is rather increased than diminished. In these\r\ncases the organs of sense are closed, and the voluntary power is suspended,\r\nwhile the motions dependent on internal irritations, as those of digestion\r\nand secretion, are carried on with more than their usual vigour; which has\r\nled superficial observers to confound these cases with those arising from\r\nwant of irritability. Thus if you lift up the eyelid of an apoplectic\r\npatient, who is not actually dying, the iris will, as usual, contract\r\nitself, as this motion is associated with the stimulus of light; but it is\r\nnot so in the last stages of nervous fevers, where the pupil of the eye\r\ncontinues expanded in the broad day-light: in the former case there is a\r\nwant of voluntary power, in the latter a want of irritability.\r\n\r\nHence also those constitutions which are deficient in quantity of\r\nirritability, and which possess too great sensibility, as during the pain\r\nof hunger, of hysteric spasms, or nervous headachs, are generally supposed\r\nto have too much irritability; and opium, which in its due dose is a most\r\npowerful stimulant, is erroneously called a sedative; because by increasing\r\nthe irritative motions it decreases the pains arising from defect of them.\r\n\r\nWhy the pulse should become quicker both from an increase of irritation, as\r\nin the synocha irritativa, or irritative fever with strong pulse; and from\r\nthe decrease of it, as in the typhus irritativus, or irritative fever with\r\nweak pulse; seems paradoxical. The former circumstance needs no\r\nillustration; since if the stimulus of the blood, or the irritability of\r\nthe sanguiferous system be increased, and the strength of the patient not\r\ndiminished, it is plain that the motions must be performed quicker and\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nIn the latter circumstance the weakness of the muscular power of the heart\r\nis soon over-balanced by the elasticity of the coats of the arteries, which\r\nthey possess besides a muscular power of contraction; and hence the\r\narteries are distended to less than their usual diameters. The heart being\r\nthus stopped, when it is but half emptied, begins sooner to dilate again;\r\nand the arteries being dilated to less than their usual diameters, begin so\r\nmuch sooner to contract themselves; insomuch, that in the last stages of\r\nfevers with weakness the frequency of pulsation of the heart and arteries\r\nbecomes doubled; which, however, is never the case in fevers with strength,\r\nin which they seldom exceed 118 or 120 pulsations in a minute. It must be\r\nadded, that in these cases, while the pulse is very small and very quick,\r\nthe heart often feels large, and labouring to one's hand; which coincides\r\nwith the above explanation, shewing that it does not completely empty\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n3. In cases however of debility from paucity of blood, as in animals which\r\nare bleeding to death in the slaughter-house, the quick pulsations of the\r\nheart and arteries may be owing to their not being distended to more than\r\nhalf their usual diastole; and in consequence they must contract sooner, or\r\nmore frequently, in a given time. As weak people are liable to a deficient\r\nquantity of blood, this cause may occasionally contribute to quicken the\r\npulse in fevers with debility, which may be known by applying one's hand\r\nupon the heart as above; but the principal cause I suppose to consist in\r\nthe diminution of sensorial power. When a muscle contains, or is supplied\r\nwith but little sensorial power, its contraction soon ceases, and in\r\nconsequence may soon recur, as is seen in the trembling hands of people\r\nweakened by age or by drunkenness. See Sect. XII. 1. 4. XII. 3. 4.\r\n\r\nIt may nevertheless frequently happen, that both the deficiency of\r\nstimulus, as where the quantity of blood is lessened (as described in No.\r\n4. of this section), and the deficiency of sensorial power, as in those of\r\nthe temperament of irritability, described in Sect. XXXI. occur at the same\r\ntime; which will thus add to the quickness of the pulse and to the danger\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. A certain degree of heat is necessary to muscular motion, and is,\r\nin consequence, essential to life. This is observed in those animals and\r\ninsects which pass the cold season in a torpid state, and which revive on\r\nbeing warmed by the fire. This necessary stimulus of heat has two sources;\r\none from the fluid atmosphere of heat, in which all things are immersed,\r\nand the other from the internal combinations of the particles, which form\r\nthe various fluids, which are produced in the extensive systems of the\r\nglands. When either the external heat, which surrounds us, or the internal\r\nproduction of it, becomes lessened to a certain degree, the pain of cold is\r\nperceived.\r\n\r\nThis pain of cold is experienced most sensibly by our teeth, when ice is\r\nheld in the mouth; or by our whole system after having been previously\r\naccustomed to much warmth. It is probable, that this pain does not arise\r\nfrom the mechanical or chemical effects of a deficiency of heat; but that,\r\nlike the organs of sense by which we perceive hunger and thirst, this sense\r\nof heat suffers pain, when the stimulus of its object is wanting to excite\r\nthe irritative motions of the organ; that is, when the sensorial power\r\nbecomes too much accumulated in the quiescent fibres. See Sect. XII. 5. 3.\r\nFor as the peristaltic motions of the stomach are lessened, when the pain\r\nof hunger is great, so the action of the cutaneous capillaries are lessened\r\nduring the pain of cold; as appears by the paleness of the skin, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XIV. 6. on the production of ideas.\r\n\r\nThe pain in the small of the back and forehead in the cold fits of the\r\nague, in nervous hemicrania, and in hysteric paroxysms, when all the\r\nirritative motions are much impaired, seems to arise from this cause; the\r\nvessels of these membranes or muscles become torpid by their irritative\r\nassociations with other parts of the body, and thence produce less of their\r\naccustomed secretions, and in consequence less heat is evolved, and they\r\nexperience the pain of cold; which coldness may often be felt by the hand\r\napplied upon the affected part.\r\n\r\n2. The importance of a greater or less deduction of heat from the system\r\nwill be more easy to comprehend, if we first consider the great expense of\r\nsensorial power used in carrying on the vital motions; that is, which\r\ncirculates, absorbs, secretes, aerates, and elaborates the whole mass of\r\nfluids with unceasing assiduity. The sensorial power, or spirit of\r\nanimation, used in giving perpetual and strong motion to the heart, which\r\novercomes the elasticity and vis inertiæ of the whole arterial system; next\r\nthe expense of sensorial power in moving with great force and velocity the\r\ninnumerable trunks and ramifications of the arterial system; the expense of\r\nsensorial power in circulating the whole mass of blood through the long and\r\nintricate intortions of the very fine vessels, which compose the glands and\r\ncapillaries; then the expense of sensorial power in the exertions of the\r\nabsorbent extremities of all the lacteals, and of all the lymphatics, which\r\nopen their mouths on the external surface of the skin, and on the internal\r\nsurfaces of every cell or interstice of the body; then the expense of\r\nsensorial power in the venous absorption, by which the blood is received\r\nfrom the capillary vessels, or glands, where the arterial power ceases, and\r\nis drank up, and returned to the heart; next the expense of sensorial power\r\nused by the muscles of respiration in their office of perpetually expanding\r\nthe bronchia, or air-vessels, of the lungs; and lastly in the unceasing\r\nperistaltic motions of the stomach and whole system of intestines, and in\r\nall the secretions of bile, gastric juice, mucus, perspirable matter, and\r\nthe various excretions from the system. If we consider the ceaseless\r\nexpense of sensorial power thus perpetually employed, it will appear to be\r\nmuch greater in a day than all the voluntary exertions of our muscles and\r\norgans of sense consume in a week; and all this without any sensible\r\nfatigue! Now, if but a part of these vital motions are impeded, or totally\r\nstopped for but a short time, we gain an idea, that there must be a great\r\naccumulation of sensorial power; as its production in these organs, which\r\nare subject to perpetual activity, is continued during their quiescence,\r\nand is in consequence accumulated.\r\n\r\nWhile, on the contrary, where those vital organs act too forcibly by\r\nincrease of stimulus without a proportionally-increased production of\r\nsensorial power in the brain, it is evident, that a great deficiency of\r\naction, that is torpor, must soon follow, as in fevers; whereas the\r\nlocomotive muscles, which act only by intervals, are neither liable to so\r\ngreat accumulation of sensorial power during their times of inactivity, nor\r\nto so great an exhaustion of it during their times of action.\r\n\r\nThus, on going into a very cold bath, suppose at 33 degrees of heat on\r\nFahrenheit's scale, the action of the subcutaneous capillaries, or glands,\r\nand of the mouths of the cutaneous absorbents is diminished, or ceases for\r\na time. Hence less or no blood passes these capillaries, and paleness\r\nsucceeds. But soon after emerging from the bath, a more florid colour and a\r\ngreater degree of heat is generated on the skin than was possessed before\r\nimmersion; for the capillary glands, after this quiescent state, occasioned\r\nby the want of stimulus, become more irritable than usual to their natural\r\nstimuli, owing to the accumulation of sensorial power, and hence a greater\r\nquantity of blood is transmitted through them, and a greater secretion of\r\nperspirable matter; and, in consequence, a greater degree of heat succeeds.\r\nDuring the continuance in cold water the breath is cold, and the act of\r\nrespiration quick and laborious; which have generally been ascribed to the\r\nobstruction of the circulating fluid by a spasm of the cutaneous vessels,\r\nand by a consequent accumulation of blood in the lungs, occasioned by the\r\npressure as well as by the coldness of the water. This is not a\r\nsatisfactory account of this curious phænomenon, since at this time the\r\nwhole circulation is less, as appears from the smallness of the pulse and\r\ncoldness of the breath; which shew that less blood passes through the lungs\r\nin a given time; the same laborious breathing immediately occurs when the\r\npaleness of the skin is produced by fear, where no external cold or\r\npressure are applied.\r\n\r\nThe minute vessels of the bronchia, through which the blood passes from the\r\narterial to the venal system, and which correspond with the cutaneous\r\ncapillaries, have frequently been exposed to cold air, and become quiescent\r\nalong with those of the skin; and hence their motions are so associated\r\ntogether, that when one is affected either with quiescence or exertion, the\r\nother sympathizes with it, according to the laws of irritative association.\r\nSee Sect. XXVII. 1. on hæmorrhages.\r\n\r\nBesides the quiescence of the minute vessels of the lungs, there are many\r\nother systems of vessels which become torpid from their irritative\r\nassociations with those of the skin, as the absorbents of the bladder and\r\nintestines; whence an evacuation of pale urine occurs, when the naked skin\r\nis exposed only to the coldness of the atmosphere; and sprinkling the naked\r\nbody with cold water is known to remove even pertinacious constipation of\r\nthe bowels. From the quiescence of such extensive systems of vessels as the\r\nglands and capillaries of the skin, and the minute vessels of the lungs,\r\nwith their various absorbent series of vessels, a great accumulation of\r\nsensorial powers is occasioned; part of which is again expended in the\r\nincreased exertion of all these vessels, with an universal glow of heat in\r\nconsequence of this exertion, and the remainder of it adds vigour to both\r\nthe vital and voluntary exertions of the whole day.\r\n\r\nIf the activity of the subcutaneous vessels, and of those with which their\r\nactions are associated, was too great before cold immersion, as in the hot\r\ndays of summer, and by that means the sensorial power was previously\r\ndiminished, we see the cause why the cold bath gives such present strength;\r\nnamely, by stopping the unnecessary activity of the subcutaneous vessels,\r\nand thus preventing the too great exhaustion of sensorial power; which, in\r\nmetaphorical language, has been called _bracing_ the system: which is,\r\nhowever, a mechanical term, only applicable to drums, or musical strings:\r\nas on the contrary the word _relaxation_, when applied to living animal\r\nbodies, can only mean too small a quantity of stimulus, or too small a\r\nquantity of sensorial power; as explained in Sect. XII. 1.\r\n\r\n3. This experiment of cold bathing presents us with a simple fever-fit; for\r\nthe pulse is weak, small, and quick during the cold immersion; and becomes\r\nstrong, full, and quick during the subsequent glow of heat; till in a few\r\nminutes these symptoms subside, and the temporary fever ceases.\r\n\r\nIn those constitutions where the degree of inirritability, or of debility,\r\nis greater than natural, the coldness and paleness of the skin with the\r\nquick and weak pulse continue a long time after the patient leaves the\r\nbath; and the subsequent heat approaches by unequal flushings, and he feels\r\nhimself disordered for many hours. Hence the bathing in a cold spring of\r\nwater, where the heat is but forty-eight degrees on Fahrenheit's\r\nthermometer, much disagrees with those of weak or inirritable habits of\r\nbody; who possess so little sensorial power, that they cannot without\r\ninjury bear to have it diminished even for a short time; but who can\r\nnevertheless bear the more temperate coldness of Buxton bath, which is\r\nabout eighty degrees of heat, and which strengthens them, and makes them by\r\nhabit less liable to great quiescence from small variations of cold, and\r\nthence less liable to be disordered by the unavoidable accidents of life.\r\nHence it appears, why people of these inirritable constitutions, which is\r\nanother expression for sensorial deficiency, are often much injured by\r\nbathing in a cold spring of water; and why they should continue but a very\r\nshort time in baths, which are colder than their bodies; and should\r\ngradually increase both the degree of coldness of the water, and the time\r\nof their continuance in it, if they would obtain salutary effects from cold\r\nimmersions. See Sect. XII. 2. 1.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in all cases where the heat of the external surface of\r\nthe body, or of the internal surface of the lungs, is greater than natural,\r\nthe use of exposure to cool air may be deduced. In fever-fits attended with\r\nstrength, that is with great quantity of sensorial power, it removes the\r\nadditional stimulus of heat from the surfaces above mentioned, and thus\r\nprevents their excess of useless motion; and in fever-fits attended with\r\ndebility, that is with a deficiency of the quantity of sensorial power, it\r\nprevents the great and dangerous waste of sensorial power expended in the\r\nunnecessary increase of the actions of the glands and capillaries of the\r\nskin and lungs.\r\n\r\n4. In the same manner, when any one is long exposed to very cold air, a\r\nquiescence is produced of the cutaneous and pulmonary capillaries and\r\nabsorbents, owing to the deficiency of their usual stimulus of heat; and\r\nthis quiescence of so great a quantity of vessels affects, by irritative\r\nassociation, the whole absorbent and glandular system, which becomes in a\r\ngreater or less degree quiescent, and a cold fit of fever is produced.\r\n\r\nIf the deficiency of the stimulus of heat is very great, the quiescence\r\nbecomes so general as to extinguish life, as in those who are frozen to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIf the deficiency of heat be in less degree, but yet so great as in some\r\nmeasure to disorder the system, and should occur the succeeding day, it\r\nwill induce a greater degree of quiescence than before, from its acting in\r\nconcurrence with the period of the diurnal circle of actions, explained in\r\nSect. XXXVI. Hence from a small beginning a greater and greater degree of\r\nquiescence may be induced, till a complete fever-fit is formed; and which\r\nwill continue to recur at the periods by which it was produced. See Sect.\r\nXVII. 3. 6.\r\n\r\nIf the degree of quiescence occasioned by defect of the stimulus of heat be\r\nvery great, it will recur a second time by a slighter cause, than that\r\nwhich first induced it. If the cause, which induces the second fit of\r\nquiescence, recurs the succeeding day, the quotidian fever is produced; if\r\nnot till the alternate day, the tertian fever; and if not till after\r\nseventy-two hours from the first fit of quiescence, the quartan fever is\r\nformed. This last kind of fever recurs less frequently than the other, as\r\nit is a disease only of those of the temperament of associability, as\r\nmentioned in Sect. XXXI.; for in other constitutions the capability of\r\nforming a habit ceases, before the new cause of quiescence is again\r\napplied, if that does not occur sooner than in seventy-two hours.\r\n\r\nAnd hence those fevers, whose cause is from cold air of the night or\r\nmorning, are more liable to observe the solar day in their periods; while\r\nthose from other causes frequently observe the lunar day in their periods,\r\ntheir paroxysms returning near an hour later every day, as explained in\r\nSect. XXXVI.\r\n\r\nIV. Another frequent cause of the cold fits of fever is the defect of the\r\nstimulus of distention. The whole arterial system would appear, by the\r\nexperiments of Haller, to be irritable by no other stimulus, and the\r\nmotions of the heart and alimentary canal are certainly in some measure\r\ndependant on the same cause. See Sect. XIV. 7. Hence there can be no\r\nwonder, that the diminution of distention should frequently induce the\r\nquiescence, which constitutes the beginning of fever-fits.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Leiutaud has judiciously mentioned the deficiency of the quantity\r\nof blood amongst the causes of diseases, which he says is frequently\r\nevident in dissections: fevers are hence brought on by great hæmorrhages,\r\ndiarrhoeas, or other evacuations; or from the continued use of diet, which\r\ncontains but little nourishment; or from the exhaustion occasioned by\r\nviolent fatigue, or by those chronic diseases in which the digestion is\r\nmuch impaired; as where the stomach has been long affected with the gout or\r\nschirrus; or in the paralysis of the liver, as described in Sect. XXX.\r\nHence a paroxysm of gout is liable to recur on bleeding or purging; as the\r\ntorpor of some viscus, which precedes the inflammation of the foot, is thus\r\ninduced by the want of the stimulus of distention. And hence the\r\nextremities of the body, as the nose and fingers, are more liable to become\r\ncold, when we have long abstained from food; and hence the pulse is\r\nincreased both in strength and velocity above the natural standard after a\r\nfull meal by the stimulus of distention.\r\n\r\nHowever, this stimulus of distention, like the stimulus of heat above\r\ndescribed, though it contributes much to the due action not only of the\r\nheart, arteries, and alimentary canal, but seems necessary to the proper\r\nsecretion of all the various glands; yet perhaps it is not the sole cause\r\nof any of these numerous motions: for as the lacteals, cutaneous\r\nabsorbents, and the various glands appear to be stimulated into action by\r\nthe peculiar pungency of the fluids they absorb, so in the intestinal canal\r\nthe pungency of the digesting aliment, or the acrimony of the fæces, seem\r\nto contribute, as well as their bulk, to promote the peristaltic motions;\r\nand in the arterial system, the momentum of the particles of the\r\ncirculating blood, and their acrimony, stimulate the arteries, as well as\r\nthe distention occasioned by it. Where the pulse is small this defect of\r\ndistention is present, and contributes much to produce the febris\r\nirritativa pulsu debili, or irritative fever with weak pulse, called by\r\nmodern writers nervous fever, as a predisponent cause. See Sect. XII. 1. 4.\r\nMight not the transfusion of blood, suppose of four ounces daily from a\r\nstrong man, or other healthful animal, as a sheep or an ass, be used in the\r\nearly state of nervous or putrid fevers with great prospect of success?\r\n\r\nV. 1. The defect of the momentum of the particles of the circulating blood\r\nis another cause of the quiescence, with which the cold fits of fever\r\ncommence. This stimulus of the momentum of the progressive particles of the\r\nblood does not act over the whole body like those of heat and distention\r\nabove described, but is confined to the arterial system; and differs from\r\nthe stimulus of the distention of the blood, as much as the vibration of\r\nthe air does from the currents of it. Thus are the different organs of our\r\nbodies stimulated by four different mechanic properties of the external\r\nworld: the sense of touch by the pressure of solid bodies so as to\r\ndistinguish their figure; the muscular system by the distention, which they\r\noccasion; the internal surface of the arteries, by the momentum of their\r\nmoving particles; and the auditory nerves, by the vibration of them: and\r\nthese four mechanic properties are as different from each other as the\r\nvarious chemical ones, which are adapted to the numerous glands, and to the\r\nother organs of sense.\r\n\r\n2. The momentum of the progressive particles of blood is compounded of\r\ntheir velocity and their quantity of matter: hence whatever circumstances\r\ndiminish either of these without proportionally increasing the other, and\r\nwithout superadding either of the general stimuli of heat or distention,\r\nwill tend to produce a quiescence of the arterial system, and from thence\r\nof all the other irritative motions, which are connected with it.\r\n\r\nHence in all those constitutions or diseases where the blood contains a\r\ngreater proportion of serum, which is the lightest part of its composition,\r\nthe pulsations of the arteries are weaker, as in nervous fevers, chlorosis,\r\nand hysteric complaints; for in these cases the momentum of the progressive\r\nparticles of blood is less: and hence, where the denser parts of its\r\ncomposition abound, as the red part of it, or the coagulable lymph, the\r\narterial pulsations are stronger; as in those of robust health, and in\r\ninflammatory diseases.\r\n\r\nThat this stimulus of the momentum of the particles of the circulating\r\nfluid is of the greatest consequence to the arterial action, appears from\r\nthe experiment of injecting air into the blood vessels, which seems to\r\ndestroy animal life from the want of this stimulus of momentum; for the\r\ndistention of the arteries is not diminished by it, it possesses no\r\ncorrosive acrimony, and is less liable to repass the valves than the blood\r\nitself; since air-valves in all machinery require much less accuracy of\r\nconstruction than those which are opposed to water.\r\n\r\n3. One method of increasing the velocity of the blood, and in consequence\r\nthe momentum of its particles, is by the exercise of the body, or by the\r\nfriction of its surface: so, on the contrary, too great indolence\r\ncontributes to decrease this stimulus of the momentum of the particles of\r\nthe circulating blood, and thus tends to induce quiescence; as is seen in\r\nhysteric cases, and chlorosis, and the other diseases of sedentary people.\r\n\r\n4. The velocity of the particles of the blood in certain circumstances is\r\nincreased by venesection, which, by removing a part of it, diminishes the\r\nresistance to the motion of the other part, and hence the momentum of the\r\nparticles of it is increased. This may be easily understood by considering\r\nit in the extreme, since, if the resistance was greatly increased, so as to\r\novercome the propelling power, there could be no velocity, and in\r\nconsequence no momentum at all. From this circumstance arises that curious\r\nphænomenon, the truth of which I have been more than once witness to, that\r\nvenesection will often instantaneously relieve those nervous pains, which\r\nattend the cold periods of hysteric, asthmatic, or epileptic diseases; and\r\nthat even where large doses of opium have been in vain exhibited. In these\r\ncases the pulse becomes stronger after the bleeding, and the extremities\r\nregain their natural warmth; and an opiate then given acts with much more\r\ncertain effect.\r\n\r\nVI. There is another cause, which seems occasionally to induce quiescence\r\ninto some part of our system, I mean the influence of the sun and moon; the\r\nattraction of these luminaries, by decreasing the gravity of the particles\r\nof the blood, cannot affect their momentum, as their vis inertiæ remains\r\nthe same; but it may nevertheless produce some chemical change in them,\r\nbecause whatever affects the general attractions of the particles of matter\r\nmay be supposed from analogy to affect their specific attractions or\r\naffinities: and thus the stimulus of the particles of blood may be\r\ndiminished, though not their momentum. As the tides of the sea obey the\r\nsouthing and northing of the moon (allowing for the time necessary for\r\ntheir motion, and the obstructions of the shores), it is probable, that\r\nthere are also atmospheric tides on both sides of the earth, which to the\r\ninhabitants of another planet might so deflect the light as to resemble the\r\nring of Saturn. Now as these tides of water, or of air, are raised by the\r\ndiminution of their gravity, it follows, that their pressure on the surface\r\nof the earth is no greater than the pressure of the other parts of the\r\nocean, or of the atmosphere, where no such tides exist; and therefore that\r\nthey cannot affect the mercury in the barometer. In the same manner, the\r\ngravity of all other terrestrial bodies is diminished at the times of the\r\nsouthing and northing of the moon, and that in a greater degree when this\r\ncoincides with the southing and northing of the sun, and this in a still\r\ngreater degree about the times of the equinoxes. This decrease of the\r\ngravity of all bodies during the time the moon passes our zenith or nadir\r\nmight possibly be shewn by the slower vibrations of a pendulum, compared\r\nwith a spring clock, or with astronomical observation. Since a pendulum of\r\na certain length moves slower at the line than near the poles, because the\r\ngravity being diminished and the vis inertiæ continuing the same, the\r\nmotive power is less, but the resistance to be overcome continues the same.\r\nThe combined powers of the lunar and solar attraction is estimated by Sir\r\nIsaac Newton not to exceed one 7,868,850th part of the power of\r\ngravitation, which seems indeed but a small circumstance to produce any\r\nconsiderable effect on the weight of sublunary bodies, and yet this is\r\nsufficient to raise the tides at the equator above ten feet high; and if it\r\nbe considered, what small impulses of other bodies produce their effects on\r\nthe organs of sense adapted to the perception of them, as of vibration on\r\nthe auditory nerves, we shall cease to to be surprised, that so minute a\r\ndiminution in the gravity of the particles of blood should so far affect\r\ntheir chemical changes, or their stimulating quality, as, joined with other\r\ncauses, sometimes to produce the beginnings of diseases.\r\n\r\nAdd to this, that if the lunar influence produces a very small degree of\r\nquiescence at first, and if that recurs at certain periods even with less\r\npower to produce quiescence than at first, yet the quiescence will daily\r\nincrease by the acquired habit acting at the same time, till at length so\r\ngreat a degree of quiescence is induced as to produce phrensy, canine\r\nmadness, epilepsy, hysteric pains or cold fits of fever, instances of many\r\nof which are to be found in Dr. Mead's work on this subject. The solar\r\ninfluence also appears daily in several diseases; but as darkness, silence,\r\nsleep, and our periodical meals mark the parts of the solar circle of\r\nactions, it is sometimes dubious to which of these the periodical returns\r\nof these diseases are to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nAs far as I have been able to observe, the periods of inflammatory diseases\r\nobserve the solar day; as the gout and rheumatism have their greatest\r\nquiescence about noon and midnight, and their exacerbations some hours\r\nafter; as they have more frequently their immediate cause from cold air,\r\ninanition, or fatigue, than from the effects of lunations: whilst the cold\r\nfits of hysteric patients, and those in nervous fevers, more frequently\r\noccur twice a day, later by near half an hour each time, according to the\r\nlunar day; whilst some fits of intermittents, which are undisturbed by\r\nmedicines, return at regular solar periods, and others at lunar ones; which\r\nmay, probably, be owing to the difference of the periods of those external\r\ncircumstances of cold, inanition, or lunation, which immediately caused\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, observe, that the periods of quiescence and exacerbation\r\nin diseases do not always commence at the times of the syzygies or\r\nquadratures of the moon and sun, or at the times of their passing the\r\nzenith or nadir; but as it is probable, that the stimulus of the particles\r\nof the circumfluent blood is gradually diminished from the time of the\r\nquadratures to that of the syzygies, the quiescence may commence at any\r\nhour, when co-operating with other causes of quiescence, it becomes great\r\nenough to produce a disease: afterwards it will continue to recur at the\r\nsame period of the lunar or solar influence; the same cause operating\r\nconjointly with the acquired habit, that is with the catenation of this new\r\nmotion with the dissevered links of the lunar or solar circles of animal\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the periods of menstruation obey the lunar month with great\r\nexactness in healthy patients (and perhaps the venereal orgasm in brute\r\nanimals does the same), yet these periods do not commence either at the\r\nsyzygies or quadratures of the lunations, but at whatever time of the lunar\r\nperiods they begin, they observe the same in their returns till some\r\ngreater cause disturbs them.\r\n\r\nHence, though the best way to calculate the time of the expected returns of\r\nthe paroxysms of periodical diseases is to count the number of hours\r\nbetween the commencement of the two preceding fits, yet the following\r\nobservations may be worth attending to, when we endeavour to prevent the\r\nreturns of maniacal or epileptic diseases; whose periods (at the beginning\r\nof them especially) frequently observe the syzygies of the moon and sun,\r\nand particularly about the equinox.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the two tides happening in every revolution of the moon, is\r\nthat when the moon approaches nearest to the zenith or nadir; for this\r\nreason, while the sun is in the northern signs, that is during the vernal\r\nand summer months, the greater of the two diurnal tides in our latitude is\r\nthat, when the moon is above the horizon; and when the sun is in the\r\nsouthern signs, or during the autumnal and winter months, the greater tide\r\nis that, which arises when the moon is below the horizon: and as the sun\r\napproaches somewhat nearer the earth in winter than in summer, the greatest\r\nequinoctial tides are observed to be a little before the vernal equinox,\r\nand a little after the autumnal one.\r\n\r\nDo not the cold periods of lunar diseases commence a few hours before the\r\nsouthing of the moon during the vernal and summer months, and before the\r\nnorthing of the moon during the autumnal and winter months? Do not palsies\r\nand apoplexies, which occur about the equinoxes, happen a few days before\r\nthe vernal equinoctial lunation, and after the autumnal one? Are not the\r\nperiods of those diurnal diseases more obstinate, that commence many hours\r\nbefore the southing or northing of the moon, than of those which commence\r\nat those times? Are not those palsies and apoplexies more dangerous which\r\ncommence many days before the syzygies of the moon, than those which happen\r\nat those times? See Sect. XXXVI. on the periods of diseases.\r\n\r\nVII. Another very frequent cause of the cold fit of fever is the quiescence\r\nof some of those large congeries of glands, which compose the liver,\r\nspleen, or pancreas; one or more of which are frequently so enlarged in the\r\nautumnal intermittents as to be perceptible to the touch externally, and\r\nare called by the vulgar ague-cakes. As these glands are stimulated into\r\naction by the specific pungency of the fluids, which they absorb, the\r\ngeneral cause of their quiescence seems to be the too great insipidity of\r\nthe fluids of the body, co-operating perhaps at the same time with other\r\ngeneral causes of quiescence.\r\n\r\nHence, in marshy countries at cold seasons, which have succeeded hot ones,\r\nand amongst those, who have lived on innutritious and unstimulating diet,\r\nthese agues are most frequent. The enlargement of these quiescent viscera,\r\nand the swelling of the præcordia in many other fevers, is, most probably,\r\nowing to the same cause; which may consist in a general deficiency of the\r\nproduction of sensorial power, as well as in the diminished stimulation of\r\nthe fluids; and when the quiescence of so great a number of glands, as\r\nconstitute one of those large viscera, commences, all the other irritative\r\nmotions are affected by their connection with it, and the cold fit of fever\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\nVIII. There are many other causes, which produce quiescence of some part of\r\nthe animal system, as fatigue, hunger, thirst, bad diet, disappointed love,\r\nunwholesome air, exhaustion from evacuations, and many others; but the last\r\ncause, that we shall mention, as frequently productive of cold fits of\r\nfever, is fear or anxiety of mind. The pains, which we are first and most\r\ngenerally acquainted with, have been produced by defect of some stimulus;\r\nthus, soon after our nativity we become acquainted with the pain from the\r\ncoldness of the air, from the want of respiration, and from the want of\r\nfood. Now all these pains occasioned by defect of stimulus are attended\r\nwith quiescence of the organ, and at the same time with a greater or less\r\ndegree of quiescence of other parts of the system: thus, if we even endure\r\nthe pain of hunger so as to miss one meal instead of our daily habit of\r\nrepletion, not only the peristaltic motions of the stomach and bowels are\r\ndiminished, but we are more liable to coldness of our extremities, as of\r\nour noses, and ears, and feet, than at other times.\r\n\r\nNow, as fear is originally excited by our having experienced pain, and is\r\nitself a painful affection, the same quiescence of other fibrous motions\r\naccompany it, as have been most frequently connected with this kind of\r\npain, as explained in Sect. XVI. 8. 1. as the coldness and paleness of the\r\nskin, trembling, difficult respiration, indigestion, and other symptoms,\r\nwhich contribute to form the cold fit of fevers. Anxiety is fear continued\r\nthrough a longer time, and, by producing chronical torpor of the system,\r\nextinguishes life slowly, by what is commonly termed a broken heart.\r\n\r\nIX. 1. We now step forwards to consider the other symptoms in consequence\r\nof the quiescence which begins the fits of fever. If by any of the\r\ncircumstances before described, or by two or more of them acting at the\r\nsame time, a great degree of quiescence is induced on any considerable part\r\nof the circle of irritative motions, the whole class of them is more or\r\nless disturbed by their irritative associations. If this torpor be\r\noccasioned by a deficient supply of sensorial power, and happens to any of\r\nthose parts of the system, which are accustomed to perpetual activity, as\r\nthe vital motions, the torpor increases rapidly, because of the great\r\nexpenditure of sensorial power by the incessant activity of those parts of\r\nthe system, as shewn in No. 3. 2. of this Section. Hence a deficiency of\r\nall the secretions succeeds, and as animal heat is produced in proportion\r\nto the quantity of those secretions, the coldness of the skin is the first\r\ncircumstance, which is attended to. Dr. Martin asserts, that some parts of\r\nhis body were warmer than natural in the cold fit of fever; but it is\r\ncertain, that those, which are uncovered, as the fingers, and nose, and\r\nears, are much colder to the touch, and paler in appearance. It is\r\npossible, that his experiments were made at the beginning of the subsequent\r\nhot fits; which commence with partial distributions of heat, owing to some\r\nparts of the body regaining their natural irritability sooner than others.\r\n\r\nFrom the quiescence of the anastomosing capillaries a paleness of the skin\r\nsucceeds, and a less secretion of the perspirable matter; from the\r\nquiescence of the pulmonary capillaries a difficulty of respiration arises;\r\nand from the quiescence of the other glands less bile, less gastric and\r\npancreatic juice, are secreted into the stomach and intestines, and less\r\nmucus and saliva are poured into the mouth; whence arises the dry tongue,\r\ncostiveness, dry ulcers, and paucity of urine. From the quiescence of the\r\nabsorbent system arises the great thirst, as less moisture is absorbed from\r\nthe atmosphere. The absorption from the atmosphere was observed by Dr.\r\nLyster to amount to eighteen ounces in one night, above what he had at the\r\nsame time insensibly perspired. See Langrish. On the same account the urine\r\nis pale, though in small quantity, for the thinner part is not absorbed\r\nfrom it; and when repeated ague-fits continue long, the legs swell from the\r\ndiminished absorption of the cellular absorbents.\r\n\r\nFrom the quiescence of the intestinal canal a loss of appetite and\r\nflatulencies proceed. From the partial quiescence of the glandular viscera\r\na swelling and tension about the præcordia becomes sensible to the touch;\r\nwhich is occasioned by the delay of the fluids from the defect of venous or\r\nlymphatic absorption. The pain of the forehead, and of the limbs, and of\r\nthe small of the back, arises from the quiescence of the membranous fascia,\r\nor muscles of those parts, in the same manner as the skin becomes painful,\r\nwhen the vessels, of which it is composed, become quiescent from cold. The\r\ntrembling in consequence of the pain of coldness, the restlessness, and the\r\nyawning, and stretching of the limbs, together with the shuddering, or\r\nrigours, are convulsive motions; and will be explained amongst the diseases\r\nof volition; Sect. XXXIV.\r\n\r\nSickness and vomiting is a frequent symptom in the beginnings of\r\nfever-fits, the muscular fibres of the stomach share the general torpor and\r\ndebility of the system; their motions become first lessened, and then stop,\r\nand then become retrograde; for the act of vomiting, like the globus\r\nhystericus and the borborigmi of hypochondriasis, is always a symptom of\r\ndebility, either from want of stimulus, as in hunger; or from want of\r\nsensorial power, as after intoxication; or from sympathy with some other\r\ntorpid irritative motions, as in the cold fits of ague. See Sect. XII. 5.\r\n5. XXIX. 11. and XXXV. 1. 3. where this act of vomiting is further\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe small pulse, which is said by some writers to be slow at the\r\ncommencement of ague-fits, and which is frequently trembling and\r\nintermittent, is owing to the quiescence of the heart and arterial system,\r\nand to the resistance opposed to the circulating fluid from the inactivity\r\nof all the glands and capillaries. The great weakness and inability to\r\nvoluntary motions, with the insensibility of the extremities, are owing to\r\nthe general quiescence of the whole moving system; or, perhaps, simply to\r\nthe deficient production of sensorial power.\r\n\r\nIf all these symptoms are further increased, the quiescence of all the\r\nmuscles, including the heart and arteries, becomes complete, and death\r\nensues. This is, most probably, the case of those who are starved to death\r\nwith cold, and of those who are said to die in Holland from long skaiting\r\non their frozen canals.\r\n\r\n2. As soon as this general quiescence of the system ceases, either by the\r\ndiminution of the cause, or by the accumulation of sensorial power, (as in\r\nsyncope, Sect. XII. 7. 1.) which is the natural consequence of previous\r\nquiescence, the hot fit commences. Every gland of the body is now\r\nstimulated into stronger action than is natural, as its irritability is\r\nincreased by accumulation of sensorial power during its late quiescence, a\r\nsuperabundance of all the secretions is produced, and an increase of heat\r\nin consequence of the increase of these secretions. The skin becomes red,\r\nand the perspiration great, owing to the increased action of the\r\ncapillaries during the hot part of the paroxysm. The secretion of\r\nperspirable matter is perhaps greater during the hot fit than in the\r\nsweating fit which follows; but as the absorption of it also is greater, it\r\ndoes not stand on the skin in visible drops: add to this, that the\r\nevaporation of it also is greater, from the increased heat of the skin. But\r\nat the decline of the hot fit, as the mouths of the absorbents of the skin\r\nare exposed to the cooler air, or bed-clothes, these vessels sooner lose\r\ntheir increased activity, and cease to absorb more than their natural\r\nquantity: but the secerning vessels for some time longer, being kept warm\r\nby the circulating blood, continue to pour out an increased quantity of\r\nperspirable matter, which now stands on the skin in large visible drops;\r\nthe exhalation of it also being lessened by the greater coolness of the\r\nskin, as well as its absorption by the diminished action of the lymphatics.\r\nSee Class I. 1. 2. 3.\r\n\r\nThe increased secretion of bile and of other fluids poured into the\r\nintestines frequently induce a purging at the decline of the hot fit; for\r\nas the external absorbent vessels have their mouths exposed to the cold\r\nair, as above mentioned, they cease to be excited into unnatural activity\r\nsooner than the secretory vessels, whose mouths are exposed to the warmth\r\nof the blood: now, as the internal absorbents sympathize with the external\r\nones, these also, which during the hot fit drank up the thinner part of the\r\nbile, or of other secreted fluids, lose their increased activity before the\r\ngland loses its increased activity, at the decline of the hot fit; and the\r\nloose dejections are produced from the same cause, that the increased\r\nperspiration stands on the surface of the skin, from the increased\r\nabsorption ceasing sooner than the increased secretion.\r\n\r\nThe urine during the cold fit is in small quantity and pale, both from a\r\ndeficiency of the secretion and a deficiency of the absorption.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot fit it is in its usual quantity, but very high coloured and\r\nturbid, because a greater quantity had been secreted by the increased\r\naction of the kidnies, and also a greater quantity of its more aqueous part\r\nhad been absorbed from it in the bladder by the increased action of the\r\nabsorbents; and lastly, at the decline of the hot fit it is in large\r\nquantity and less coloured, or turbid, because the absorbent vessels of the\r\nbladder, as observed above, lose their increased action by sympathy with\r\nthe cutaneous ones sooner than the secretory vessels of the kidnies lose\r\ntheir increased activity. Hence the quantity of the sediment, and the\r\ncolour of the urine, in fevers, depend much on the quantity secreted by the\r\nkidnies, and the quantity absorbed from it again in the bladder: the kinds\r\nof sediment, as the lateritious, purulent, mucous, or bloody sediments,\r\ndepend on other causes. It should be observed, that if the sweating be\r\nincreased by the heat of the room, or of the bed-clothes, that a paucity of\r\nturbid urine will continue to be produced, as the absorbents of the bladder\r\nwill have their activity increased by their sympathy with the vessels of\r\nthe skin, for the purpose of supplying the fluid expended in perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe pulse becomes strong and full owing to the increased irritability of\r\nthe heart and arteries, from the accumulation of sensorial power during\r\ntheir quiescence, and to the quickness of the return of the blood from the\r\nvarious glands and capillaries. This increased action of all the secretory\r\nvessels does not occur very suddenly, nor universally at the same time. The\r\nheat seems to begin about the center, and to be diffused from thence\r\nirregularly to the other parts of the system. This may be owing to the\r\nsituation of the parts which first became quiescent and caused the\r\nfever-fit, especially when a hardness or tumour about the præcordia can be\r\nfelt by the hand; and hence this part, in whatever viscus it is seated,\r\nmight be the first to regain its natural or increased irritability.\r\n\r\n3. It must be here noted, that, by the increased quantity of heat, and of\r\nthe impulse of the blood at the commencement of the hot fit, a great\r\nincrease of stimulus is induced, and is now added to the increased\r\nirritability of the system, which was occasioned by its previous\r\nquiescence. This additional stimulus of heat and momentum of the blood\r\naugments the violence of the movements of the arterial and glandular system\r\nin an increasing ratio. These violent exertions still producing more heat\r\nand greater momentum of the moving fluids, till at length the sensoral\r\npower becomes wasted by this great stimulus beneath its natural quantity,\r\nand predisposes the system to a second cold fit.\r\n\r\nAt length all these unnatural exertions spontaneously subside with the\r\nincreased irritability that produced them; and which was itself produced by\r\nthe preceding quiescence, in the same manner as the eye, on coming from\r\ndarkness into day-light, in a little time ceases to be dazzled and pained,\r\nand gradually recovers its natural degree of irritability.\r\n\r\n4. But if the increase of irritability, and the consequent increase of the\r\nstimulus of heat and momentum, produce more violent exertions than those\r\nabove described; great pain arises in some part of the moving system, as in\r\nthe membranes of the brain, pleura, or joints; and new motions of the\r\nvessels are produced in consequence of this pain, which are called\r\ninflammation; or delirium or stupor arises; as explained in Sect. XXI. and\r\nXXXIII.: for the immediate effect is the same, whether the great energy of\r\nthe moving organs arises from an increase of stimulus or an increase of\r\nirritability; though in the former case the waste of sensorial power leads\r\nto debility, and in the latter to health.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\nX. Those muscles, which are less frequently exerted, and whose actions are\r\ninterrupted by sleep, acquire less accumulation of sensorial power during\r\ntheir quiescent state, as the muscles of locomotion. In these muscles after\r\ngreat exertion, that is, after great exhaustion of sensorial power, the\r\npain of fatigue ensues; and during rest there is a renovation of the\r\nnatural quantity of sensorial power; but where the rest, or quiescence of\r\nthe muscle, is long continued, a quantity of sensorial power becomes\r\naccumulated beyond what is necessary; as appears by the uneasiness\r\noccasioned by want of exercise; and which in young animals is one cause\r\nexciting them into action, as is seen in the play of puppies and kittens.\r\n\r\nBut when those muscles, which are habituated to perpetual actions, as those\r\nof the stomach by the stimulus of food, those of the vessels of the skin by\r\nthe stimulus of heat, and those which constitute the arteries and glands by\r\nthe stimulus of the blood, become for a time quiescent, from the want of\r\ntheir appropriated stimuli, or by their associations with other quiescent\r\nparts of the system; a greater accumulation of sensorial power is acquired\r\nduring their quiescence, and a greater or quicker exhaustion of it is\r\nproduced during their increased action.\r\n\r\nThis accumulation of sensorial power from deficient action, if it happens\r\nto the stomach from want of food, occasions the pain of hunger; if it\r\nhappens to the vessels of the skin from want of heat, it occasions the pain\r\nof cold; and if to the arterial system from the want of its adapted\r\nstimuli, many disagreeable sensations are occasioned, such as are\r\nexperienced in the cold fits of intermittent fevers, and are as various, as\r\nthere are glands or membranes in the system, and are generally termed\r\nuniversal uneasiness.\r\n\r\nWhen the quiescence of the arterial system is not owing to defect of\r\nstimulus as above, but to the defective quantity of sensorial power, as in\r\nthe commencement of nervous fever, or irritative fever with weak pulse, a\r\ngreat torpor of this system is quickly induced; because both the irritation\r\nfrom the stimulus of the blood, and the association of the vascular motions\r\nwith each other, continue to excite the arteries into action, and thence\r\nquickly exhaust the ill-supplied vascular muscles; for to rest is death;\r\nand therefore those vascular muscles continue to proceed, though with\r\nfeebler action, to the extreme of weariness or faintness: while nothing\r\nsimilar to this affects the locomotive muscles, whose actions are generally\r\ncaused by volition, and not much subject either to irritation or to other\r\nkinds of associations besides the voluntary ones, except indeed when they\r\nare excited by the lash of slavery.\r\n\r\nIn these vascular muscles, which are subject to perpetual action, and\r\nthence liable to great accumulation of sensorial power during their\r\nquiescence from want of stimulus, a great increase of activity occurs,\r\neither from the renewal of their accustomed stimulus, or even from much\r\nless quantities of stimulus than usual. This increase of action constitutes\r\nthe hot fit of fever, which is attended with various increased secretions,\r\nwith great concomitant heat, and general uneasiness. The uneasiness\r\nattending this hot paroxysm of fever, or fit of exertion, is very different\r\nfrom that, which attends the previous cold fit, or fit of quiescence, and\r\nis frequently the cause of inflammation, as in pleurisy, which is treated\r\nof in the next section.\r\n\r\nA similar effect occurs after the quiescence of our organs of sense; those\r\nwhich are not subject to perpetual action, as the taste and smell, are less\r\nliable to an exuberant accumulation of sensorial power after their having\r\nfor a time been inactive; but the eye, which is in perpetual action during\r\nthe day, becomes dazzled, and liable to inflammation after a temporary\r\nquiescence.\r\n\r\nWhere the previous quiescence has been owing to a defect of sensorial\r\npower, and not to a defect of stimulus, as in the irritative fever with\r\nweak pulse, a similar increase of activity of the arterial system succeeds,\r\neither from the usual stimulus of the blood, or from a stimulus less than\r\nusual; but as there is in general in these cases of fever with weak pulse a\r\ndeficiency of the quantity of the blood, the pulse in the hot fit is weaker\r\nthan in health, though it is stronger than in the cold fit, as explained in\r\nNo. 2. of this section. But at the same time in those fevers, where the\r\ndefect of irritation is owing to the defect of the quantity of sensorial\r\npower, as well as to the defect of stimulus, another circumstance occurs;\r\nwhich consists in the partial distribution of it, as appears in partial\r\nflushings, as of the face or bosom, while the extremities are cold; and in\r\nthe increase of particular secretions, as of bile, saliva, insensible\r\nperspiration, with great heat of the skin, or with partial sweats, or\r\ndiarrhoea.\r\n\r\nThere are also many uneasy sensations attending these increased actions,\r\nwhich, like those belonging to the hot fit of fever with strong pulse, are\r\nfrequently followed by inflammation, as in scarlet fever; which\r\ninflammation is nevertheless accompanied with a pulse weaker, though\r\nquicker, than the pulse during the remission or intermission of the\r\nparoxysms, though stronger than that of the previous cold fit.\r\n\r\nFrom hence I conclude, that both the cold and hot fits of fever are\r\nnecessary consequences of the perpetual and incessant action of the\r\narterial and glandular system; since those muscular fibres and those organs\r\nof sense, which are most frequently exerted, become necessarily most\r\naffected both with defect and accumulation of sensorial power: and that\r\nhence _fever-fits are not an effort of nature to relieve herself_, and that\r\ntherefore they should always be prevented or diminished as much as\r\npossible, by any means which decrease the general or partial vascular\r\nactions, when they are greater, or by increasing them when they are less\r\nthan in health, as described in Sect. XII. 6. 1.\r\n\r\nThus have I endeavoured to explain, and I hope to the satisfaction of the\r\ncandid and patient reader, the principal symptoms or circumstances of fever\r\nwithout the introduction of the supernatural power of spasm. To the\r\narguments in favour of the doctrine of spasm it may be sufficient to reply,\r\nthat in the evolution of medical as well as of dramatic catastrophe,\r\n\r\n  Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit.--HOR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

Amongst these the business of digestion supplies us with an\r\ninstance: if the food, which we swallow, is not attended with agreeable\r\nsensation, it digests less perfectly; and if very disagreeable sensation\r\naccompanies it, such as a nauseous idea, or very disgustful taste, the\r\ndigestion becomes impeded; or retrograde motions of the stomach and\r\noesophagus succeed, and the food is ejected.\r\n\r\nThe business of generation depends so much on agreeable sensation, that,\r\nwhere the object is disgustful, neither voluntary exertion nor irritation\r\ncan effect the purpose; which is also liable to be interrupted by the pain\r\nof fear or bashfulness.\r\n\r\nBesides the pleasure, which attends the irritations produced by the objects\r\nof lust and hunger, there seems to be a sum of pleasurable affection\r\naccompanying the various secretions of the numerous glands, which\r\nconstitute the pleasure of life, in contradistinction to the tedium vitæ.\r\nThis quantity or sum of pleasurable affection, seems to contribute to the\r\ndue or energetic performance of the whole moveable system, as well that of\r\nthe heart and arteries, as of digestion and of absorption; since without\r\nthe due quantity of pleasurable sensation, flatulency and hypochondriacism\r\naffect the intestines, and a languor seizes the arterial pulsations and\r\nsecretions; as occurs in great and continued anxiety of the mind.\r\n\r\n2. Besides the febrile motions occasioned by irritation, described in Sect.\r\nXXXII. and termed irritative fever, it frequently happens that pain is\r\nexcited by the violence of the fibrous contractions; and other new motions\r\nare then superadded, in consequence of sensation, which we shall term\r\nfebris sensitiva, or sensitive fever. It must be observed, that most\r\nirritative fevers begin with a decreased exertion of irritation, owing to\r\ndefect of stimulus; but that on the contrary the sensitive fevers, or\r\ninflammations, generally begin with the increased exertion of sensation, as\r\nmentioned in Sect. XXXI. on temperaments: for though the cold fit, which\r\nintroduces inflammation, commences with decreased irritation, yet the\r\ninflammation itself commences in the hot fit during the increase of\r\nsensation. Thus a common pustule, or phlegmon, in a part of little\r\nsensibility does not excite an inflammatory fever; but if the stomach,\r\nintestines, or the tender substance beneath the nails, be injured, great\r\nsensation is produced, and the whole system is thrown into that kind of\r\nexertion, which constitutes inflammation.\r\n\r\nThese sensitive fevers, like the irritative ones, resolve themselves into\r\nthose with arterial strength, and those with arterial debility, that is\r\nwith excess or defect of sensorial power; these may be termed the febris\r\nsensitiva pulsu forti, sensitive fever with strong pulse, which is the\r\nsynocha, or inflammatory fever; and the febris sensitiva pulsu debili,\r\nsensitive fever with weak pulse, which is the typhus gravior, or putrid\r\nfever of some writers.\r\n\r\n3. The inflammatory fevers, which are here termed sensitive fevers with\r\nstrong pulse, are generally attended with some topical inflammation, as\r\npleurisy, peripneumony, or rheumatism, which distinguishes them from\r\nirritative fevers with strong pulse. The pulse is strong, quick, and full;\r\nfor in this fever there is great irritation, as well as great sensation,\r\nemployed in moving the arterial system. The size, or coagulable lymph,\r\nwhich appears on the blood, is probably an increased secretion from the\r\ninflamed internal lining of the whole arterial system, the thinner part\r\nbeing taken away by the increased absorption of the inflamed lymphatics.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive fevers with weak pulse, which are termed putrid or malignant\r\nfevers, are distinguished from irritative fevers with weak pulse, called\r\nnervous fevers, described in the last section, as the former consist of\r\ninflammation joined with debility, and the latter of debility alone. Hence\r\nthere is greater heat and more florid colour of the skin in the former,\r\nwith petechiæ, or purple spots, and aphthæ, or sloughs in the throat, and\r\ngenerally with previous contagion.\r\n\r\nWhen animal matter dies, as a slough in the throat, or the mortified part\r\nof a carbuncle, if it be kept moist and warm, as during its abhesion to a\r\nliving body, it will soon putrify. This, and the origin of contagion from\r\nputrid animal substances, seem to have given rise to the septic and\r\nantiseptic theory of these fevers.\r\n\r\nThe matter in pustules and ulcers is thus liable to become putrid, and to\r\nproduce microscopic animalcula; the urine, if too long retained, may also\r\ngain a putrescent smell, as well as the alvine feces; but some writers have\r\ngone so far as to believe, that the blood itself in these fevers has smelt\r\nputrid, when drawn from the arm of the patient: but this seems not well\r\nfounded; since a single particle of putrid matter taken into the blood can\r\nproduce fever, how can we conceive that the whole mass could continue a\r\nminute in a putrid state without destroying life? Add to this, that putrid\r\nanimal substances give up air, as in gangrenes; and that hence if the blood\r\nwas putrid, air should be given out, which in the blood-vessels is known to\r\noccasion immediate death.\r\n\r\nIn these sensitive fevers with strong pulse (or inflammations) there are\r\ntwo sensorial faculties concerned in producing the disease, viz. irritation\r\nand sensation; and hence, as their combined action is more violent, the\r\ngeneral quantity of sensorial power becomes further exhausted during the\r\nexacerbation, and the system more rapidly weakened than in irritative fever\r\nwith strong pulse; where the spirit of animation is weakened by but one\r\nmode of its exertion: so that this febris sensitiva pulsu forti (or\r\ninflammatory fever,) may be considered as the febris irritativa pulsu\r\nforti, with the addition of inflammation; and the febris sensitiva pulsu\r\ndebili (or malignant fever) may be considered as the febris irritativa\r\npulsu debili (or nervous fever), with the addition of inflammation.\r\n\r\n4. In these putrid or malignant fevers a deficiency of irritability\r\naccompanies the increase of sensibility; and by this waste of sensorial\r\npower by the excess of sensation, which was already too small, arises the\r\ndelirium and stupor which so perpetually attend these inflammatory fevers\r\nwith arterial debility. In these cases the voluntary power first ceases to\r\nact from deficiency of sensorial spirit; and the stimuli from external\r\nbodies have no effect on the exhausted sensorial power, and a delirium like\r\na dream is the consequence. At length the internal stimuli cease to excite\r\nsufficient irritation, and the secretions are either not produced at all,\r\nor too parsimonious in quantity. Amongst these the secretion of the brain,\r\nor production of the sensorial power, becomes deficient, till at last all\r\nsensorial power ceases, except what is just necessary to perform the vital\r\nmotions, and a stupor succeeds; which is thus owing to the same cause as\r\nthe preceding delirium exerted in a greater degree.\r\n\r\nThis kind of delirium is owing to a suspension of volition, and to the\r\ndisobedience of the senses to external stimuli, and is always occasioned by\r\ngreat debility, or paucity of sensorial power; it is therefore a bad sign\r\nat the end of inflammatory fevers, which had previous arterial strength, as\r\nrheumatism, or pleurisy, as it shews the presence of great exhaustion of\r\nsensorial power in a system, which having lately been exposed to great\r\nexcitement, is not so liable to be stimulated into its healthy action,\r\neither by additional stimulus of food and medicines, or by the accumulation\r\nof sensorial power during its present torpor. In inflammatory fevers with\r\ndebility, as those termed putrid fevers, delirium is sometimes, as well as\r\nstupor, rather a favourable sign; as less sensorial power is wasted during\r\nits continuance (see Class II. 1. 6. 8.), and the constitution not having\r\nbeen previously exposed to excess of stimulation, is more liable to be\r\nexcited after previous quiescence.\r\n\r\nWhen the sum of general pleasurable sensation becomes too great, another\r\nkind of delirium supervenes, and the ideas thus excited are mistaken for\r\nthe irritations of external objects: such a delirium is produced for a time\r\nby intoxicating drugs, as fermented liquors, or opium: a permanent delirium\r\nof this kind is sometimes induced by the pleasures of inordinate vanity, or\r\nby the enthusiastic hopes of heaven. In these cases the power of volition\r\nis incapable of exertion, and in a great degree the external senses become\r\nincapable of perceiving their adapted stimuli, because the whole sensorial\r\npower is employed or expended on the ideas excited by pleasurable\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nThis kind of delirium is distinguished from that which attends the fevers\r\nabove mentioned from its not being accompanied with general debility, but\r\nsimply with excess of pleasurable sensation; and is therefore in some\r\nmeasure allied to madness or to reverie; it differs from the delirium of\r\ndreams, as in this the power of volition is not totally suspended, nor are\r\nthe senses precluded from external stimulation; there is therefore a degree\r\nof consistency, in this kind of delirium, and a degree of attention to\r\nexternal objects, neither of which exist in the delirium of fevers or in\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n5. It would appear, that the vascular system of other animals are less\r\nliable to be put into action by their general sum of pleasurable or painful\r\nsensation; and that the trains of their ideas, and the muscular motions\r\nusually associated with them, are less powerfully connected than in the\r\nhuman system. For other animals neither weep, nor smile, nor laugh; and are\r\nhence seldom subject to delirium, as treated of in Sect. XVI. on Instinct.\r\nNow as our epidemic and contagious diseases are probably produced by\r\ndisagreeable sensation, and not simply by irritation; there appears a\r\nreason, why brute animals are less liable to epidemic or contagious\r\ndiseases; and secondly, why none of our contagions, as the small-pox or\r\nmeasles, can be communicated to them, though one of theirs, viz. the\r\nhydrophobia, as well as many of their poisons, as those of snakes and of in\r\ninsects, communicate their deleterious or painful effects to mankind.\r\n\r\nWhere the quantity of general painful sensation is too great in the system,\r\ninordinate voluntary exertions are produced either of our ideas, as in\r\nmelancholy and madness, or of our muscles, as in convulsion. From these\r\nmaladies also brute animals are much more exempt than mankind, owing to\r\ntheir greater inaptitude to voluntary exertion, as mentioned in Sect. XVI.\r\non Instinct.\r\n\r\nII. 1. When any moving organ is excited into such violent motions, that a\r\nquantity of pleasurable or painful sensation is produced, it frequently\r\nhappens (but not always) that new motions of the affected organ are\r\ngenerated in consequence of the pain or pleasure, which are termed\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nThese new motions are of a peculiar kind, tending to distend the old, and\r\nto produce new fibres, and thence to elongate the straight muscles, which\r\nserve locomotion, and to form new vessels at the extremities or sides of\r\nthe vascular muscles.\r\n\r\n2. Thus the pleasurable sensations produce an enlargement of the nipples of\r\nnurses, of the papillæ of the tongue, of the penis, and probably produce\r\nthe growth of the body from its embryon state to its maturity; whilst the\r\nnew motions in consequence of painful sensation, with the growth of the\r\nfibres or vessels, which they occasion, are termed inflammation.\r\n\r\nHence when the straight muscles are inflamed, part of their tendons at each\r\nextremity gain new life and sensibility, and thus the muscle is for a time\r\nelongated; and inflamed bones become soft, vascular, and sensible. Thus new\r\nvessels shoot over the cornea of inflamed eyes, and into scirrhous tumours,\r\nwhen they become inflamed; and hence all inflamed parts grow together by\r\nintermixture, and inosculation of the new and old vessels.\r\n\r\nThe heat is occasioned from the increased secretions either of mucus, or of\r\nthe fibres, which produce or elongate the vessels. The red colour is owing\r\nto the pellucidity of the newly formed vessels, and as the arterial parts\r\nof them are probably formed before their correspondent venous parts.\r\n\r\n3. These new motions are excited either from the increased quantity of\r\nsensation in consequence of greater fibrous contractions, or from increased\r\nsensibility, that is, from the increased quantity of sensorial power in the\r\nmoving organ. Hence they are induced by great external stimuli, as by\r\nwounds, broken bones; and by acrid or infectious materials; or by common\r\nstimuli on those organs, which have been some time quiescent; as the usual\r\nlight of the day inflames the eyes of those, who have been confined in\r\ndungeons; and the warmth of a common fire inflames those, who have been\r\npreviously exposed to much cold.\r\n\r\nBut these new motions are never generated by that pain, which arises from\r\ndefect of stimulus, as from hunger, thirst, cold, or inanition, with all\r\nthose pains, which are termed nervous. Where these pains exist, the motions\r\nof the affected part are lessened; and if inflammation succeeds, it is in\r\nsome distant parts; as coughs are caused by coldness and moisture being\r\nlong applied to the feet; or it is in consequence of the renewal of the\r\nstimulus, as of heat or food, which excites our organs into stronger action\r\nafter their temporary quiescence; as kibed heels after walking in snow.\r\n\r\n4. But when these new motions of the vascular muscles are exerted with\r\ngreater violence, and these vessels are either elongated too much or too\r\nhastily, a new material is secreted from their extremities, which is of\r\nvarious kinds according to the peculiar animal motions of this new kind of\r\ngland, which secretes it; such is the pus laudabile or common matter, the\r\nvariolous matter, venereal matter, catarrhous matter, and many others.\r\n\r\n5. These matters are the product of an animal process; they are secreted or\r\nproduced from the blood by certain diseased motions of the extremities of\r\nthe blood-vessels, and are on that account all of them contagious; for if a\r\nportion of any of these matters is transmitted into the circulation, or\r\nperhaps only inserted into the skin, or beneath the cuticle of an healthy\r\nperson, its stimulus in a certain time produces the same kind of morbid\r\nmotions, by which itself was produced; and hence a similar kind is\r\ngenerated. See Sect. XXXIX. 6. 1.\r\n\r\n6. It is remarkable, that many of these contagious matters are capable of\r\nproducing a similar disease but once; as the small-pox and measles; and I\r\nsuppose this is true of all those contagious diseases, which are\r\nspontaneously cured by nature in a certain time; for if the body was\r\ncapable of receiving the disease a second time, the patient must\r\nperpetually infect himself by the very matter, which he has himself\r\nproduced, and is lodged about him; and hence he could never become free\r\nfrom the disease. Something similar to this is seen in the secondary fever\r\nof the confluent small-pox; there is a great absorption of variolous\r\nmatter, a very minute part of which would give the genuine small-pox to\r\nanother person; but here it only stimulates the system into common fever;\r\nlike that which common puss, or any other acrid material might occasion.\r\n\r\n7. In the pulmonary consumption, where common matter is daily absorbed, an\r\nirritative fever only, without new inflammation, is generally produced;\r\nwhich is terminated like other irritative fevers by sweats, or loose\r\nstools. Hence it does not appear, that this absorbed matter always acts as\r\na contagious material producing fresh inflammation or new abscesses. Though\r\nthere is reason to believe, that the first time any common matter is\r\nabsorbed, it has this effect, but not the second time, like the variolous\r\nmatter above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the opinion, that the pulmonary consumption is sometimes\r\ninfectious, which opinion was held by the ancients, and continues in Italy\r\nat present; and I have myself seen three or four instances, where a husband\r\nand wife, who have slept together, and have thus much received each other's\r\nbreath, who have infected each other, and both died in consequence of the\r\noriginal taint of only one of them. This also accounts for the abscesses in\r\nvarious parts of the body, that are sometimes produced after the inoculated\r\nsmall-pox is terminated; for this second absorption of variolous matter\r\nacts like common matter, and produces only irritative fever in those\r\nchildren, whose constitutions have already experienced the absorption of\r\ncommon matter; and inflammation with a tendency to produce new abscesses in\r\nthose, whose constitutions have not experienced the absorptions of common\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that more certain proofs might have been found to shew,\r\nthat common matter is infectious the first time it is absorbed, tending to\r\nproduce similar abscesses, but not the second time of its absorption, if\r\nthis subject had been attended to.\r\n\r\n8. These contagious diseases are very numerous, as the plague, small-pox,\r\nchicken-pox, measles, scarlet-fever, pemphigus, catarrh, chincough,\r\nvenereal disease, itch, trichoma, tinea. The infectious material does not\r\nseem to be dissolved by the air, but only mixed with it perhaps in fine\r\npowder, which soon subsides; since many of these contagions can only be\r\nreceived by actual contact; and others of them only at small distances from\r\nthe infected person; as is evident from many persons having been near\r\npatients of the small-pox without acquiring the disease.\r\n\r\nThe reason, why many of these diseases are received but once, and others\r\nrepeatedly, is not well understood; it appears to me, that the constitution\r\nbecomes so accustomed to the stimuli of these infectious materials, by\r\nhaving once experienced them, that though irritative motions, as hectic\r\nfevers, may again be produced by them, yet no sensation, and in consequence\r\nno general inflammation succeeds; as disagreeable smells or tastes by habit\r\ncease to be perceived; they continue indeed to excite irritative ideas on\r\nthe organs of sense, but these are not succeeded by sensation.\r\n\r\nThere are many irritative motions, which were at first succeeded by\r\nsensation, but which by frequent repetition cease to excite sensation, as\r\nexplained in Sect. XX. on Vertigo. And, that this circumstance exists in\r\nrespect to infectious matter appears from a known fact; that nurses, who\r\nhave had the small-pox, are liable to experience small ulcers on their arms\r\nby the contact of variolous matter in lifting their patients; and that when\r\npatients, who have formerly had the small-pox have been inoculated in the\r\narm, a phlegmon, or inflamed sore, has succeeded, but no subsequent fever.\r\nWhich shews, that the contagious matter of the small-pox has not lost its\r\npower of stimulating the part it is applied to, but that the general system\r\nis not affected in consequence. See Section XII. 7. 6. XIX. 9.\r\n\r\n9. From the accounts of the plague, virulent catarrh, and putrid dysentery,\r\nit seems uncertain, whether these diseases are experienced more than once;\r\nbut the venereal disease and itch are doubtless repeatedly infectious; and\r\nas these diseases are never cured spontaneously, but require medicines,\r\nwhich act without apparent operation, some have suspected, that the\r\ncontagious material produces similar matter rather by a chemical change of\r\nthe fluids, than by an animal process; and that the specific medicines\r\ndestroy their virus by chemically combining with it. This opinion is\r\nsuccessfully combated by Mr. Hunter, in his Treatise on Venereal Disease,\r\nPart I. c. i.\r\n\r\nBut this opinion wants the support of analogy, as there is no known process\r\nin animal bodies, which is purely chemical, not even digestion; nor can any\r\nof these matters be produced by chemical processes. Add to this, that it is\r\nprobable, that the insects, observed in the pustules of the itch, and in\r\nthe stools of dysenteric patients, are the consequences, and not the causes\r\nof these diseases. And that the specific medicines, which cure the itch and\r\nlues venerea, as brimstone and mercury, act only by increasing the\r\nabsorption of the matter in the ulcuscles of those diseases, and thence\r\ndisposing them to heal; which would otherwise continue to spread.\r\n\r\nWhy the venereal disease, and itch, and tenia, or scald head, are\r\nrepeatedly contagious, while those contagions attended with fever can be\r\nreceived but once, seems to depend on their being rather local diseases\r\nthan universal ones, and are hence not attended with fever, except the\r\npurulent fever in their last stages, when the patient is destroyed by them.\r\nOn this account the whole of the system does not become habituated to these\r\nmorbid actions, so as to cease to be affected with sensation by a\r\nrepetition of the contagion. Thus the contagious matter of the venereal\r\ndisease, and of the tenia, affects the lymphatic glands, as the inquinal\r\nglands, and those about the roots of the hair and neck, where it is\r\narrested, but does not seem to affect the blood-vessels, since no fever\r\nensues.\r\n\r\nHence it would appear, that these kinds of contagion are propagated not by\r\nmeans of the circulation, but by sympathy of distant parts with each other;\r\nsince if a distant part, as the palate, should be excited by sensitive\r\nassociation into the same kind of motions, as the parts originally affected\r\nby the contact of infectious matter; that distant part will produce the\r\nsame kind of infectious matter; for every secretion from the blood is\r\nformed from it by the peculiar motions of the fine extremities of the\r\ngland, which secretes it; the various secreted fluids, as the bile, saliva,\r\ngastric juice, not previously existing, as such, in the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nAnd this peculiar sympathy between the genitals and the throat, owing to\r\nsensitive association, appears not only in the production of venereal\r\nulcers in the throat, but in variety of other instances, as in the mumps,\r\nin the hydrophobia, some coughs, strangulation, the production of the\r\nbeard, change of voice at puberty. Which are further described in Class IV.\r\n1. 2. 7.\r\n\r\nTo evince that the production of such large quantities of contagious\r\nmatter, as are seen in some variolous patients, so as to cover the whole\r\nskin almost with pustules, does not arise from any chemical fermentation in\r\nthe blood, but that it is owing to morbid motions of the fine extremities\r\nof the capillaries, or glands, whether these be ruptured or not, appears\r\nfrom the quantity of this matter always corresponding with the quantity of\r\nthe fever; that is, with the violent exertions of those glands and\r\ncapillaries, which are the terminations of the arterial system.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this theory is evinced further by a circumstance observed by\r\nMr. J. Hunter, in his Treatise on Venereal Disease; that in a patient, who\r\nwas inoculated for the small-pox, and who appeared afterwards to have been\r\npreviously infested with the measles, the progress of the small-pox was\r\ndelayed till the measles had run their course, and that then the small-pox\r\nwent through its usual periods.\r\n\r\nTwo similar cases fell under my care, which I shall here relate, as it\r\nconfirms that of Mr. Hunter, and contributes to illustrate this part of the\r\ntheory of contagious diseases. I have transcribed the particulars from a\r\nletter of Mr. Lightwood of Yoxal, the surgeon who daily attended them, and\r\nat my request, after I had seen them, kept a kind of journal of their\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nMiss H. and Miss L. two sisters, the one about four and the other about\r\nthree years old, were inoculated Feb. 7, 1791. On the 10th there was a\r\nredness on both arms discernible by a glass. On the 11th their arms were so\r\nmuch inflamed as to leave no doubt of the infection having taken place. On\r\nthe 12th less appearance of inflammation on their arms. In the evening Miss\r\nL. had an eruption, which resembled the measles. On the 12th the eruption\r\non Miss L. was very full on the face and breast, like the measles, with\r\nconsiderable fever. It was now known, that the measles were in a farm house\r\nin the neighbourhood. Miss H.'s arm less inflamed than yesterday. On the\r\n14th Miss L.'s fever great, and the eruption universal. The arm appears to\r\nbe healed. Miss H.'s arm somewhat redder. They were now put into separate\r\nrooms. On the 15th Miss L.'s arms as yesterday. Eruption continues. Miss\r\nH.'s arms have varied but little. 16th, the eruptions on Miss L. are dying\r\naway, her fever gone. Begins to have a little redness in one arm at the\r\nplace of inoculation. Miss H.'s arms get redder, but she has no appearance\r\nof complaint. 20th, Miss L.'s arms have advanced slowly till this day, and\r\nnow a few pustules appear. Miss H.'s arm has made little progress from the\r\n16th to this day, and now she has some fever. 21st, Miss L. as yesterday.\r\nMiss H. has much inflammation, and an increase of the red circle on one arm\r\nto the size of half a crown, and had much fever at night, with fetid\r\nbreath. 22d, Miss L.'s pustules continue advancing. Miss H.'s inflammation\r\nof her arm and red circle increases. A few red spots appear in different\r\nparts with some degree of fever this morning, 23d. Miss L. has a larger\r\ncrop of pustules. Miss H. has small pustules and great inflammation of her\r\narms, with but one pustule likely to suppurate. After this day they\r\ngradually got well, and the pustules disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn one of these cases the measles went through their common course with\r\nmilder symptoms than usual, and in the other the measly contagion seemed\r\njust sufficient to stop the progress of variolous contagion, but without\r\nitself throwing the constitution into any disorder. At the same time both\r\nthe measles and small-pox seem to have been rendered milder. Does not this\r\ngive an idea, that if they were both inoculated at the same time, that\r\nneither of them might affect the patient?\r\n\r\nFrom these cases I contend, that the contagious matter of these diseases\r\ndoes not affect the constitution by a fermentation, or chemical change of\r\nthe blood, because then they must have proceeded together, and have\r\nproduced a third something, not exactly similar to either of them: but that\r\nthey produce new motions of the cutaneous terminations of the\r\nblood-vessels, which for a time proceed daily with increasing activity,\r\nlike some paroxysms of fever, till they at length secrete or form a similar\r\npoison by these unnatural actions.\r\n\r\nNow as in the measles one kind of unnatural motion takes place, and in the\r\nsmall-pox another kind, it is easy to conceive, that these different kinds\r\nof morbid motions cannot exist together; and therefore, that that which has\r\nfirst begun will continue till the system becomes habituated to the\r\nstimulus which occasions it, and has ceased to be thrown into action by it;\r\nand then the other kind of stimulus will in its turn produce fever, and new\r\nkinds of motions peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\n10. On further considering the action of contagious matter, since the\r\nformer part of this work was sent to the press; where I have asserted, in\r\nSect. XXII. 3. 3. that it is probable, that the variolous matter is\r\ndiffused through the blood; I prevailed on my friend Mr. Power, surgeon at\r\nBosworth in Leicestershire to try, whether the small-pox could be\r\ninoculated by using the blood of a variolous patient instead of the matter\r\nfrom the pustules; as I thought such an experiment might throw some light\r\nat least on this interesting subject. The following is an extract from his\r\nletter:--\r\n\r\n\"March 11, 1793. I inoculated two children, who had not had the small-pox,\r\nwith blood; which was taken from a patient on the second day after the\r\neruption commenced, and before it was completed. And at the same time I\r\ninoculated myself with blood from the same person, in order to compare the\r\nappearances, which might arise in a person liable to receive the infection,\r\nand in one not liable to receive it. On the same day I inoculated four\r\nother children liable to receive the infection with blood taken from\r\nanother person on the fourth day after the commencement of the eruption.\r\nThe patients from whom the blood was taken had the disease mildly, but had\r\nthe most pustules of any I could select from twenty inoculated patients;\r\nand as much of the blood was insinuated under the cuticle as I could\r\nintroduce by elevating the skin without drawing blood; and three or four\r\nsuch punctures were made in each of their arms, and the blood was used in\r\nits fluid state.\r\n\r\n\"As the appearances in all these patients, as well as in myself, were\r\nsimilar, I shall only mention them in general terms. March 13. A slight\r\nsubcuticular discoloration, with rather a livid appearance, without\r\nsoreness or pain, was visible in them all, as well as in my own hand. 15.\r\nThe discoloration somewhat less, without pain or soreness. Some patients\r\ninoculated on the same day with variolous matter have considerable\r\ninflammation. 17. The discoloration is quite gone in them all, and from my\r\nown hand, a dry mark only remaining. And they were all inoculated on the\r\n18th, with variolous matter, which produced the disease in them all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Power afterwards observes, that, as the patients from whom the blood\r\nwas taken had the disease mildly, it may be supposed, that though the\r\ncontagious matter might be mixed with the blood, it might still be in too\r\ndilute a state to convey the infection; but adds at the same time, that he\r\nhas diluted recent matter with at least five times its quantity of water,\r\nand which has still given the infection; though he has sometimes diluted it\r\nso far as to fail.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments were instituted at my request by my friend Mr.\r\nHadley, surgeon in Derby, to ascertain whether the blood of a person in the\r\nsmall-pox be capable of communicating the disease. \"Experiment 1st. October\r\n18th, 1793. I took some blood from a vein in the arm of a person who had\r\nthe small-pox, on the second day of the eruption, and introduced a small\r\nquantity of it immediately with the point of a lancet between the scars and\r\ntrue skin of the right arm of a boy nine years old in two or three\r\ndifferent places; the other arm was inoculated with variolous matter at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\"19th. The punctured parts of the right arm were surrounded with some\r\ndegree of subcuticular inflammation. 20th. The inflammation more\r\nconsiderable, with a slight degree of itching, but no pain upon pressure.\r\n21st. Upon examining the arm this day with a lens I found the inflammation\r\nless extensive, and the redness changing to a deep yellow or orange-colour,\r\n22d. Inflammation nearly gone. 23d. Nothing remained, except a slight\r\ndiscoloration and a little scurfy appearance on the punctures. At the same\r\ntime the inflammation of the arm inoculated with variolous matter was\r\nincreasing fast, and he had the disease mildly at the usual time.\r\n\r\n\"Experiment 2d. I inoculated another child at the same time and in the same\r\nmanner, with blood taken on the first day of the eruption; but as the\r\nappearance and effects were similar to those in the preceding experiment, I\r\nshall not relate them minutely.\r\n\r\n\"Experiment 3d. October 20th. Blood was taken from a person who had the\r\nsmall-pox, on the third day of the eruption, and on the sixth from the\r\ncommencement of the eruptive fever. I introduced some of it in its fluid\r\nstate into both arms of a boy seven years old.\r\n\r\n21st. There appeared to be some inflammation under the cuticle, where the\r\npunctures were made. 22d. Inflammation more considerable. 23d. On this day\r\nthe inflammation was somewhat greater, and the cuticle rather elevated.\r\n\r\n\"24th. Inflammation much less, and only a brown or orange-colour remained.\r\n25th. Scarcely any discoloration left. On this day he was inoculated with\r\nvariolous matter, the progress of the infection went on in the usual way,\r\nand he had the small-pox very favourably.\r\n\r\n\"At this time I was requested to inoculate a young person, who was thought\r\nto have had the small-pox, but his parents were not quite certain; in one\r\narm I introduced variolous matter, and in the other blood, taken as in\r\nexperiment 3d. On the second day after the operation, the punctured parts\r\nwere inflamed, though I think the arm in which I had inserted variolous\r\nmatter was rather more so than the other. On the third the inflammation was\r\nincreased, and looked much the same as in the preceding experiment. 4th.\r\nThe inflammation was much diminished, and on the 5th almost gone. He was\r\nexposed at the same time to the natural infection, but has continued\r\nperfectly well.\r\n\r\n\"I have frequently observed (and believe most practitioners have done the\r\nsame), that if variolous matter be inserted in the arm of a person who has\r\npreviously had the small-pox, that the inflammation on the second or third\r\ndays is much greater, than if they had not had the disease, but on the\r\nfourth or fifth it disappears.\r\n\r\n\"On the 23d I introduced blood into the arms of three more children, taken\r\non the third and fourth days of the eruption. The appearances were much the\r\nsame as mentioned in experiments first and third. They were afterwards\r\ninoculated with variolous matter, and had the disease in the regular way.\r\n\r\n\"The above experiments were made with blood taken from a small vein in the\r\nhand or foot of three or four different patients, whom I had at that time\r\nunder inoculation. They were selected from 160, as having the greatest\r\nnumber of pustules. The part was washed with warm water before the blood\r\nwas taken, to prevent the possibility of any matter being mixed with it\r\nfrom the surface.\"\r\n\r\nShall we conclude from hence, that the variolous matter never enters the\r\nblood-vessels? but that the morbid motions of the vessels of the skin\r\naround the insertion of it continue to increase in a larger and larger\r\ncircle for six or seven days; that then their quantity of morbid action\r\nbecomes great enough to produce a fever-fit, and to affect the stomach by\r\nassociation of motions? and finally, that a second association of motions\r\nis produced between the stomach and the other parts of the skin, inducing\r\nthem into morbid actions similar to those of the circle round the insertion\r\nof the variolous matter? Many more experiments and observations are\r\nrequired before this important question can be satisfactorily answered.\r\n\r\nIt may be adduced, that as the matter inserted into the skin of the arm\r\nfrequently swells the lymphatic in the axilla, that in that circumstance it\r\nseems to be there arrested in its progress, and cannot be imagined to enter\r\nthe blood by that lymphatic gland till the swelling of it subsides. Some\r\nother phænomena of the disease are more easily reconcileable to this theory\r\nof sympathetic motions than to that of absorption; as the time taken up\r\nbetween the insertion of the matter, and the operation of it on the system,\r\nas mentioned above. For the circle around the insertion is seen to\r\nincrease, and to inflame; and I believe, undergoes a kind of diurnal\r\nparoxysm of torpor and paleness with a succeeding increase of action and\r\ncolour, like a topical fever-fit. Whereas if the matter is conceived to\r\ncirculate for six or seven days with the blood, without producing disorder,\r\nit ought to be rendered milder, or the blood-vessels more familiarized to\r\nits acrimony.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to conceive from this doctrine of associated or\r\nsympathetic motions of distant parts of the system, how it happens, that\r\nthe variolous infection can be received but once, as before explained; than\r\nby supposing, that a change is effected in the mass of blood by any kind of\r\nfermentative process.\r\n\r\nThe curious circumstance of the two contagions of small-pox and measles not\r\nacting at the same time, but one of them resting or suspending its action\r\ntill that of the other ceases, may be much easier explained from\r\nsympathetic or associated actions of the infected part with other parts of\r\nthe system, than it can from supposing the two contagions to enter the\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the face is subject to more frequent vicissitudes of heat and\r\ncold, from its exposure to the open air, and is in consequence more liable\r\nto sensitive association with the stomach than any other part of the\r\nsurface of the body, because their actions have been more frequently thus\r\nassociated. Thus in a surfeit from drinking cold water, when a person is\r\nvery hot and fatigued, an eruption is liable to appear on the face in\r\nconsequence of this sympathy. In the same manner the rosy eruption on the\r\nfaces of drunkards more probably arises from the sympathy of the face with\r\nthe stomach, rather than between the face and the liver, as is generally\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nThis sympathy between the stomach and the skin of the face is apparent in\r\nthe eruption of the small-pox; since, where the disease is in considerable\r\nquantity, the eruption on the face first succeeds the sickness of the\r\nstomach. In the natural disease the stomach seems to be frequently\r\nprimarily affected, either alone or along with the tonsils, as the matter\r\nseems to be only diffused in the air, and by being mixed with the saliva,\r\nor mucus of the tonsils, to be swallowed into the stomach.\r\n\r\nAfter some days the irritative circles of motions become disordered by this\r\nnew stimulus, which acts upon the mucus lining of the stomach; and\r\nsickness, vertigo, and a diurnal fever succeed. These disordered irritative\r\nmotions become daily increased for two or three days, and then by their\r\nincreased action certain sensitive motions, or inflammation, is produced,\r\nand at the next cold fit of fever, when the stomach recovers from its\r\ntorpor, an inflammation of the external skin is formed in points (which\r\nafterwards suppurate), by sensitive association, in the same manner as a\r\ncough is produced in consequence of exposing the feet to cold, as described\r\nin Sect. XXV. 17. and Class IV. 2. I. 7. If the inoculated skin of the arm,\r\nas far as it appears inflamed, was to be cut out, or destroyed by caustic,\r\nbefore the fever commenced, as suppose on the fourth day after inoculation,\r\nwould this prevent the disease? as it is supposed to prevent the\r\nhydrophobia.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Where the new vessels, and enlarged old ones, which constitute\r\ninflammation, are not so hastily distended as to burst, and form a new kind\r\nof gland for the secretion of matter, as above mentioned; if such\r\ncircumstances happen as diminish the painful sensation, the tendency to\r\ngrowth ceases, and by and by an absorption commences, not only of the\r\nsuperabundant quantity of fluids deposited in the inflamed part, but of the\r\nsolids likewise, and this even of the hardest kind.\r\n\r\nThus during the growth of the second set of teeth in children, the roots of\r\nthe first set are totally absorbed, till at length nothing of them remains\r\nbut the crown; though a few weeks before, if they are drawn immaturely,\r\ntheir roots are found complete. Similar to this Mr. Hunter has observed,\r\nthat where a dead piece of bone is to exfoliate, or to separate from a\r\nliving one, that the dead part does not putrify, but remains perfectly\r\nsound, while the surface of the living part of the bone, which is in\r\ncontact with the dead part, becomes absorbed, and thus effects its\r\nseparation. Med. Comment. Edinb. V. 1. 425. In the same manner the\r\ncalcareous matter of gouty concretions, the coagulable lymph deposited on\r\ninflamed membranes in rheumatism and extravasated blood become absorbed;\r\nwhich are all as solid and as indissoluble materials as the new vessels\r\nproduced in inflammation.\r\n\r\nThis absorption of the new vessels and deposited fluids of inflamed parts\r\nis called resolution: it is produced by first using such internal means as\r\ndecrease the pain of the part, and in consequence its new motions, as\r\nrepeated bleeding, cathartics, diluent potations, and warm bath.\r\n\r\nAfter the vessels are thus emptied, and the absorption of the new vessels\r\nand deposited fluids is evidently begun, it is much promoted by stimulating\r\nthe part externally by solutions of lead, or other metals, and internally\r\nby the bark, and small doses of opium. Hence when an ophthalmy begins to\r\nbecome paler, any acrid eye-water, as a solution of six grains of white\r\nvitriol in an ounce of water, hastens the absorption, and clears the eye in\r\na very short time. But the same application used a few days sooner would\r\nhave increased the inflammation. Hence after evacuation opium in small\r\ndoses may contribute to promote the absorption of fluids deposited on the\r\nbrain, as observed by Mr. Bromfield in his treatise of surgery.\r\n\r\n2. Where an abscess is formed by the rupture of these new vessels, the\r\nviolence of inflammation ceases, and a new gland separates a material\r\ncalled pus: at the same time a less degree of inflammation produces new\r\nvessels called vulgarly proud flesh; which, if no bandage confines its\r\ngrowth, nor any other circumstance promotes absorption in the wound, would\r\nrise to a great height above the usual size of the part.\r\n\r\nHence the art of healing ulcers consists in producing a tendency to\r\nabsorption in the wound greater than the deposition. Thus when an\r\nill-conditioned ulcer separates a copious and thin discharge, by the use of\r\nany stimulus, as of salts of lead, or mercury, or copper externally\r\napplied, the discharge becomes diminished in quantity, and becomes thicker,\r\nas the thinner parts are first absorbed.\r\n\r\nBut nothing so much contributes to increase the absorption in a wound as\r\ncovering the whole limb above the sore with a bandage, which should be\r\nspread with some plaster, as with emplastrum de minio, to prevent it from\r\nslipping. By this artificial tightness of the skin, the arterial pulsations\r\nact with double their usual power in promoting the ascending current of the\r\nfluid in the valvular lymphatics.\r\n\r\nInternally the absorption from ulcers should be promoted first by\r\nevacuation, then by opium, bark, mercury, steel.\r\n\r\n3. Where the inflammation proceeds with greater violence or rapidity, that\r\nis, when by the painful sensation a more inordinate activity of the organ\r\nis produced, and by this great activity an additional quantity of painful\r\nsensation follows in an increasing ratio, till the whole of the sensorial\r\npower, or spirit of animation, in the part becomes exhausted, a\r\nmortification ensues, as in a carbuncle, in inflammations of the bowels, in\r\nthe extremities of old people, or in the limbs of those who are brought\r\nnear a fire after having been much benumbed with cold. And from hence it\r\nappears, why weak people are more subject to mortification than strong\r\nones, and why in weak persons less pain will produce mortification, namely,\r\nbecause the sensorial power is sooner exhausted by any excess of activity.\r\nI remember seeing a gentleman who had the preceding day travelled two\r\nstages in a chaise with what he termed a bearable pain in his bowels; which\r\nwhen I saw him had ceased rather suddenly, and without a passage through\r\nhim; his pulse was then weak, though not very quick; but as nothing which\r\nhe swallowed would continue in his stomach many minutes, I concluded that\r\nthe bowel was mortified; he died on the next day. It is usual for patients\r\nsinking under the small-pox with mortified pustules, and with purple spots\r\nintermixed, to complain of no pain, but to say they are pretty well to the\r\nlast moment.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\nIV. When the motions of any part of the system, in consequence of previous\r\ntorpor, are performed with more energy than in the irritative fevers, a\r\ndisagreeable sensation is produced, and new actions of some part of the\r\nsystem commence in consequence of this sensation conjointly with the\r\nirritation: which motions constitute inflammation. If the fever be attended\r\nwith a strong pulse, as in pleurisy, or rheumatism, it is termed synocha\r\nsensitiva, or sensitive fever with strong pulse; which is usually termed\r\ninflammatory fever. If it be attended with weak pulse, it is termed typhus\r\nsensitivus, or sensitive fever with weak pulse, or typhus gravior, or\r\nputrid malignant fever.\r\n\r\nThe synocha sensitiva, or sensitive fever with strong pulse, is generally\r\nattended with some topical inflammation, as in peripneumony, hepatitis, and\r\nis accompanied with much coagulable lymph, or size; which rises to the\r\nsurface of the blood, when taken into a bason, as it cools; and which is\r\nbelieved to be the increased mucous secretion from the coats of the\r\narteries, inspissated by a greater absorption of its aqueous and saline\r\npart, and perhaps changed by its delay in the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe typhus sensitivus, or sensitive fever with weak pulse, is frequently\r\nattended with delirium, which is caused by the deficiency of the quantity\r\nof sensorial power, and with variety of cutaneous eruptions.\r\n\r\nInflammation is caused by the pains occasioned by excess of action, and not\r\nby those pains which are occasioned by defect of action. These morbid\r\nactions, which are thus produced by two sensorial powers, viz. by\r\nirritation and sensation, secrete new living fibres, which elongate the old\r\nvessels, or form new ones, and at the same time much heat is evolved from\r\nthese combinations. By the rupture of these vessels, or by a new\r\nconstruction of their apertures, purulent matters are secreted of various\r\nkinds; which are infectious the first time they are applied to the skin\r\nbeneath the cuticle, or swallowed with the saliva into the stomach. This\r\ncontagion acts not by its being absorbed into the circulation, but by the\r\nsympathies, or associated actions, between the part first stimulated by the\r\ncontagious matter and the other parts of the system. Thus in the natural\r\nsmall-pox the contagion is swallowed with the saliva, and by its stimulus\r\ninflames the stomach; this variolous inflammation of the stomach increases\r\nevery day, like the circle round the puncture of an inoculated arm, till it\r\nbecomes great enough to disorder the circles of irritative and sensitive\r\nmotions, and thus produces fever-fits, with sickness and vomiting. Lastly,\r\nafter the cold paroxysm, or fit of torpor, of the stomach has increased for\r\ntwo or three successive days, an inflammation of the skin commences in\r\npoints; which generally first appear upon the face, as the associated\r\nactions between the skin of the face and that of the stomach have been more\r\nfrequently exerted together than those of any other parts of the external\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nContagious matters, as those of the measles and small-pox, do not act upon\r\nthe system at the same time; but the progress of that which was last\r\nreceived is delayed, till the action of the former infection ceases. All\r\nkinds of matter, even that from common ulcers, are probably contagious the\r\nfirst time they are inserted beneath the cuticle or swallowed into the\r\nstomach; that is, as they were formed by certain morbid actions of the\r\nextremities of the vessels, they have the power to excite similar morbid\r\nactions in the extremities of other vessels, to which they are applied; and\r\nthese by sympathy, or associations of motion, excite similar morbid actions\r\nin distant parts of the system, without entering the circulation; and hence\r\nthe blood of a patient in the small-pox will not give that disease by\r\ninoculation to others.\r\n\r\nWhen the new fibres or vessels become again absorbed into the circulation,\r\nthe inflammation ceases; which is promoted, after sufficient evacuations,\r\nby external stimulants and bandages: but where the action of the vessels is\r\nvery great, a mortification of the part is liable to ensue, owing to the\r\nexhaustion of sensorial power; which however occurs in weak people without\r\nmuch pain, and without very violent previous inflammation; and, like\r\npartial paralysis, may be esteemed one mode of natural death of old people,\r\na part dying before the whole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

Before we commence this Section on Diseased Voluntary Motions, it may\r\nbe necessary to premise, that the word volition is not used in this work\r\nexactly in its common acceptation. Volition is said in Section V. to bear\r\nthe same analogy to desire and aversion, which sensation does to pleasure\r\nand pain. And hence that, when desire or aversion produces any action of\r\nthe muscular fibres, or of the organs of sense, they are termed volition;\r\nand the actions produced in consequence are termed voluntary actions.\r\nWhence it appears, that motions of our muscles or ideas may be produced in\r\nconsequence of desire or aversion without our having the power to prevent\r\nthem, and yet these motions may be termed voluntary, according to our\r\ndefinition of the word; though in common language they would be called\r\ninvoluntary.\r\n\r\nThe objects of desire and aversion are generally at a distance, whereas\r\nthose of pleasure and pain are immediately acting upon our organs. Hence,\r\nbefore desire or aversion are exerted, so as to cause any actions, there is\r\ngenerally time for deliberation; which consists in discovering the means to\r\nobtain the object of desire, or to avoid the object of aversion; or in\r\nexamining the good or bad consequences, which may result from them. In this\r\ncase it is evident, that we have a power to delay the proposed action, or\r\nto perform it; and this power of choosing, whether we shall act or not, is\r\nin common language expressed by the word volition, or will. Whereas in this\r\nwork the word volition means simply the active state of the sensorial\r\nfaculty in producing motion in consequence of desire or aversion: whether\r\nwe have the power of restraining that action, or not; that is, whether we\r\nexert any actions in consequence of opposite desires or aversions, or not.\r\n\r\nFor if the objects of desire or aversion are present, there is no necessity\r\nto investigate or compare the _means_ of obtaining them, nor do we always\r\ndeliberate about their consequences; that is, no deliberation necessarily\r\nintervenes, and in consequence the power of choosing to act or not is not\r\nexerted. It is probable, that this twofold use of the word volition in all\r\nlanguages has confounded the metaphysicians, who have disputed about free\r\nwill and necessity. Whereas from the above analysis it would appear, that\r\nduring our sleep, we use no voluntary exertions at all; and in our waking\r\nhours, that they are the consequence of desire or aversion.\r\n\r\nTo will is to act in consequence of desire; but to desire means to desire\r\nsomething, even if that something be only to become free from the pain,\r\nwhich causes the desire; for to desire nothing is not to desire; the word\r\ndesire, therefore, includes both the action and the object or motive; for\r\nthe object and motive of desire are the same thing. Hence to desire without\r\nan object, that is, without a motive, is a solecism in language. As if one\r\nshould ask, if you could eat without food, or breathe without air.\r\n\r\nFrom this account of volition it appears, that convulsions of the muscles,\r\nas in epileptic fits, may in the common sense of that word be termed\r\ninvoluntary; because no deliberation is interposed between the desire or\r\naversion and the consequent action; but in the sense of the word, as above\r\ndefined, they belong to the class of voluntary motions, as delivered in\r\nVol. II. Class III. If this use of the word be discordant to the ear of the\r\nreader, the term morbid voluntary motions, or motions in consequence of\r\naversion, may be substituted in its stead.\r\n\r\nIf a person has a desire to be cured of the ague, and has at the same time\r\nan aversion (or contrary desire) to swallowing an ounce of Peruvian bark;\r\nhe balances desire against desire, or aversion against aversion; and thus\r\nhe acquires the power of choosing, which is the common acceptation of the\r\nword _willing_. But in the cold fit of ague, after having discovered that\r\nthe act of shuddering, or exerting the subcutaneous muscles, relieves the\r\npain of cold; he immediately exerts this act of volition, and shudders, as\r\nsoon as the pain and consequent aversion return, without any deliberation\r\nintervening; yet is this act, as well as that of swallowing an ounce of the\r\nbark, caused by volition; and that even though he endeavours in vain to\r\nprevent it by a weaker contrary volition. This recalls to our minds the\r\nstory of the hungry ass between two hay-stacks, where the two desires are\r\nsupposed so exactly to counteract each other, that he goes to neither of\r\nthe stacks, but perishes by want. Now as two equal and opposite desires are\r\nthus supposed to balance each other, and prevent all action, it follows,\r\nthat if one of these hay-stacks was suddenly removed, that the ass would\r\nirresistibly be hurried to the other, which in the common use of the word\r\nmight be called an involuntary act; but which, in our acceptation of it,\r\nwould be classed amongst voluntary actions, as above explained.\r\n\r\nHence to deliberate is to compare opposing desires or aversions, and that\r\nwhich is the most interesting at length prevails, and produces action.\r\nSimilar to this, where two pains oppose each other, the stronger or more\r\ninteresting one produces action; as in pleurisy the pain from suffocation\r\nwould produce expansion of the lungs, but the pain occasioned by extending\r\nthe inflamed membrane, which lines the chest, opposes this expansion, and\r\none or the other alternately prevails.\r\n\r\nWhen any one moves his hand quickly near another person's eyes, the\r\neye-lids instantly close; this act in common language is termed\r\ninvoluntary, as we have not time to deliberate or to exert any contrary\r\ndesire or aversion, but in this work it would be termed a voluntary act,\r\nbecause it is caused by the faculty of volition, and after a few trials the\r\nnictitation can be prevented by a contrary or opposing volition.\r\n\r\nThe power of opposing volitions is best exemplified in the story of Mutius\r\nScævola, who is said to have thrust his hand into the fire before Porcenna,\r\nand to have suffered it to be consumed for having failed him in his attempt\r\non the life of that general. Here the aversion for the loss of same, or the\r\nunsatisfied desire to serve his country, the two prevalent enthusiasms at\r\nthat time, were more powerful than the desire of withdrawing his hand,\r\nwhich must be occasioned by the pain of combustion; of these opposing\r\nvolitions\r\n\r\n  Vincit amor patriæ, laudumque immensa cupido.\r\n\r\nIf any one is told not to swallow his saliva for a minute, he soon swallows\r\nit contrary to his will, in the common sense of that word; but this also is\r\na voluntary action, as it is performed by the faculty of volition, and is\r\nthus to be understood. When the power of volition is exerted on any of our\r\nsenses, they become more acute, as in our attempts to hear small noises in\r\nthe night. As explained in Section XIX. 6. Hence by our attention to the\r\nfauces from our desire not to swallow our saliva; the fauces become more\r\nsensible; and the stimulus of the saliva is followed by greater sensation,\r\nand consequent desire of swallowing it. So that the desire or volition in\r\nconsequence of the increased sensation of the saliva is more powerful, than\r\nthe previous desire not to swallow it. See Vol. II. Deglutitio invita. In\r\nthe same manner if a modest man wishes not to want to make water, when he\r\nis confined with ladies in a coach or an assembly-room; that very act of\r\nvolition induces the circumstance, which he wishes to avoid, as above\r\nexplained; insomuch that I once saw a partial insanity, which might be\r\ncalled a voluntary diabetes, which was occasioned by the fear (and\r\nconsequent aversion) of not being able to make water at all.\r\n\r\nIt is further necessary to observe here, to prevent any confusion of\r\nvoluntary, with sensitive, or associate motions, that in all the instances\r\nof violent efforts to relieve pain, those efforts are at first voluntary\r\nexertions; but after they have been frequently repeated for the purpose of\r\nrelieving certain pains, they become associated with those pains, and cease\r\nat those times to be subservient to the will; as in coughing, sneezing, and\r\nstrangury. Of these motions those which contribute to remove or dislodge\r\nthe offending cause, as the actions of the abdominal muscles in parturition\r\nor in vomiting, though they were originally excited by volition, are in\r\nthis work termed sensitive motions; but those actions of the muscles or\r\norgans of sense, which do not contribute to remove the offending cause, as\r\nin general convulsions or in madness, are in this work termed voluntary\r\nmotions, or motions in consequence of aversion, though in common language\r\nthey are called involuntary ones. Those sensitive unrestrainable actions,\r\nwhich contribute to remove the cause of pain are uniformly and invariably\r\nexerted, as in coughing or sneezing; but those motions which are exerted in\r\nconsequence of aversion without contributing to remove the painful cause,\r\nbut only to prevent the sensation of it, as in epileptic, or cataleptic\r\nfits, are not uniformly and invariably exerted, but change from one set of\r\nmuscles to another, as will be further explained; and may by this criterion\r\nalso be distinguished from the former.\r\n\r\nAt the same time those motions, which are excited by perpetual stimulus, or\r\nby association with each other, or immediately by pleasureable or painful\r\nsensation, may properly be termed involuntary motions, as those of the\r\nheart and arteries; as the faculty of volition seldom affects those, except\r\nwhen it exists in unnatural quantity, as in maniacal people.\r\n\r\n2. It was observed in Section XIV. on the Production of Ideas, that those\r\nparts of the system, which are usually termed the organs of sense, are\r\nliable to be excited into pain by the excess of the stimulus of those\r\nobjects, which are by nature adapted to affect them; as of too great light,\r\nsound, or pressure. But that these organs receive no pain from the defect\r\nor absence of these stimuli, as in darkness or silence. But that our other\r\norgans of perception, which have generally been called appetites, as of\r\nhunger, thirst, want of heat, want of fresh air, are liable to be affected\r\nwith pain by the defect, as well as by the excess of their appropriated\r\nstimuli.\r\n\r\nThis excess or defect of stimulus is however to be considered only as the\r\nremote cause of the pain, the immediate cause being the excess or defect of\r\nthe natural action of the affected part, according to Sect. IV. 5. Hence\r\nall the pains of the body may be divided into those from excess of motion,\r\nand those from defect of motion; which distinction is of great importance\r\nin the knowledge and the cure of many diseases. For as the pains from\r\nexcess of motion either gradually subside, or are in general succeeded by\r\ninflammation; so those from defect of motion either gradually subside, or\r\nare in general succeeded by convulsion, or madness. These pains are easily\r\ndistinguishable from each other by this circumstance, that the former are\r\nattended with heat of the pained part, or of the whole body; whereas the\r\nlatter exists without increase of heat in the pained part, and is generally\r\nattended with coldness of the extremities of the body; which is the true\r\ncriterion of what have been called nervous pains.\r\n\r\nThus when any acrid material, as snuff or lime, falls into the eye, pain\r\nand inflammation and heat are produced from the excess of stimulus; but\r\nviolent hunger, hemicrania, or the clavus hystericus, are attended with\r\ncoldness of the extremities, and defect of circulation. When we are exposed\r\nto great cold, the pain we experience from the deficiency of heat is\r\nattended with a quiescence of the motions of the vascular system; so that\r\nno inflammation is produced, but a great desire of heat, and a tremulous\r\nmotion of the subcutaneous muscles, which is properly a convulsion in\r\nconsequence of this pain from defect of the stimulus of heat.\r\n\r\nIt was before mentioned, that as sensation consists in certain movements of\r\nthe sensorium, beginning at some of the extremities of it, and propagated\r\nto the central parts of it; so volition consists of certain other movements\r\nof the sensorium, commencing in the central parts of it, and propagated to\r\nsome of its extremities. This idea of these two great powers of motion in\r\nthe animal machine is confirmed from observing, that they never exist in a\r\ngreat degree or universally at the same time; for while we strongly exert\r\nour voluntary motions, we cease to feel the pains or uneasinesses, which\r\noccasioned us to exert them.\r\n\r\nHence during the time of fighting with fists or swords no pain is felt by\r\nthe combatants, till they cease to exert themselves. Thus in the beginning\r\nof ague-fits the painful sensation of cold is diminished, while the patient\r\nexerts himself in the shivering and gnashing of his teeth. He then ceases\r\nto exert himself, and the pain of cold returns; and he is thus perpetually\r\ninduced to reiterate these exertions, from which he experiences a temporary\r\nrelief. The same occurs in labour-pains, the exertion of the parturient\r\nwoman relieves the violence of the pains for a time, which recur again soon\r\nafter she has ceased to use those exertions. The same is true in many other\r\npainful diseases, as in the strangury, tenesmus, and the efforts of\r\nvomiting; all these disagreeable sensations are diminished or removed for a\r\ntime by the various exertions they occasion, and recur alternately with\r\nthose exertions.\r\n\r\nThe restlessness in some fevers is an almost perpetual exertion of this\r\nkind, excited to relieve some disagreeable sensations; the reciprocal\r\nopposite exertions of a wounded worm, the alternate emprosthotonos and\r\nopisthotonos of some spasmodic diseases, and the intervals of all\r\nconvulsions, from whatever cause, seem to be owing to this circumstance of\r\nthe laws of animation; that great or universal exertion cannot exist at the\r\nsame time with great or universal sensation, though they can exist\r\nreciprocally; which is probably resolvable into the more general law, that\r\nthe whole sensorial power being expended in one mode of exertion, there is\r\nnone to spare for any other. Whence syncope, or temporary apoplexy,\r\nsucceeds to epileptic convulsions.\r\n\r\n3. Hence when any violent pain afflicts us, of which we can neither avoid\r\nnor remove the cause, we soon learn to endeavour to alleviate it, by\r\nexerting some violent voluntary effort, as mentioned above; and are\r\nnaturally induced to use those muscles for this purpose, which have been in\r\nthe early periods of our lives most frequently or most powerfully exerted.\r\n\r\nNow the first muscles, which infants use most frequently, are those of\r\nrespiration; and on this account we gain a habit of holding our breath, at\r\nthe same time that we use great efforts to exclude it, for this purpose of\r\nalleviating unavoidable pain; or we press out our breath through a small\r\naperture of the larynx, and scream violently, when the pain is greater than\r\nis relievable by the former mode of exertion. Thus children scream to\r\nrelieve any pain either of body or mind, as from anger, or fear of being\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nHence it is curious to observe, that those animals, who have more\r\nfrequently exerted their muscles of respiration violently, as in talking,\r\nbarking, or grunting, as children, dogs, hogs, scream much more, when they\r\nare in pain, than those other animals, who use little or no language in\r\ntheir common modes of life; as horses, sheep, and cows.\r\n\r\nThe next most frequent or most powerful efforts, which infants are first\r\ntempted to produce, are those with the muscles in biting hard substances;\r\nindeed the exertion of these muscles is very powerful in common\r\nmastication, as appears from the pain we receive, if a bit of bone is\r\nunexpectedly found amongst our softer food; and further appears from their\r\nacting to so great mechanical disadvantage, particularly when we bite with\r\nthe incisores, or canine teeth; which are first formed, and thence are\r\nfirst used to violent exertion.\r\n\r\nHence when a person is in great pain, the cause of which he cannot remove,\r\nhe sets his teeth firmly together, or bites some substance between them\r\nwith great vehemence, as another mode of violent exertion to produce a\r\ntemporary relief. Thus we have a proverb where no help can be had in pain,\r\n\"to grin and abide;\" and the tortures of hell are said to be attended with\r\n\"gnashing of teeth.\"\r\n\r\nHence in violent spasmodic pains I have seen people bite not only their\r\ntongues, but their arms or fingers, or those of the attendants, or any\r\nobject which was near them; and also strike, pinch, or tear, others or\r\nthemselves, particularly the part of their own body, which is painful at\r\nthe time. Soldiers, who die of painful wounds in battle, are said in Homer\r\nto bite the ground. Thus also in the bellon, or colica saturnina, the\r\npatients are said to bite their own flesh, and dogs in this disease to bite\r\nup the ground they lie upon. It is probable that the great endeavours to\r\nbite in mad dogs, and the violence of other mad animals, is owing to the\r\nsame cause.\r\n\r\n4. If the efforts of our voluntary motions are exerted with still greater\r\nenergy for the relief of some disagreeable sensation, convulsions are\r\nproduced; as the various kinds of epilepsy, and in some hysteric paroxysms.\r\nIn all these diseases a pain, or disagreeable sensation is produced,\r\nfrequently by worms, or acidity in the bowels, or by a diseased nerve in\r\nthe side, or head, or by the pain of a diseased liver.\r\n\r\nIn some constitutions a more intolerable degree of pain is produced in some\r\npart at a distance from the cause by sensitive association, as before\r\nexplained; these pains in such constitutions arise to so great a degree,\r\nthat I verily believe no artificial tortures could equal some, which I have\r\nwitnessed; and am confident life would not have long been preserved, unless\r\nthey had been soon diminished or removed by the universal convulsion of the\r\nvoluntary motions, or by temporary madness.\r\n\r\nIn some of the unfortunate patients I have observed, the pain has risen to\r\nan inexpressible degree, as above described, before the convulsions have\r\nsupervened; and which were preceded by screaming, and grinning; in others,\r\nas in the common epilepsy, the convulsion has immediately succeeded the\r\ncommencement of the disagreeable sensations; and as a stupor frequently\r\nsucceeds the convulsions, they only seemed to remember that a pain at the\r\nstomach preceded the fit, or some other uneasy feel; or more frequently\r\nretained no memory at all of the immediate cause of the paroxysm. But even\r\nin this kind of epilepsy, where the patient does not recollect any\r\npreceding pain, the paroxysms generally are preceded by a quivering motion\r\nof the under jaw, with a biting of the tongue; the teeth afterwards become\r\npressed together with vehemence, and the eyes are then convulsed, before\r\nthe commencement of the universal convulsion; which are all efforts to\r\nrelieve pain.\r\n\r\nThe reason why these convulsive motions are alternately exerted and\r\nremitted was mentioned above, and in Sect. XII. 1. 3. when the exertions\r\nare such as give a temporary relief to the pain, which excites them, they\r\ncease for a time, till the pain is again perceived; and then new exertions\r\nare produced for its relief. We see daily examples of this in the loud\r\nreiterated laughter of some people; the pleasureable sensation, which\r\nexcites this laughter, arises for a time so high as to change its name and\r\nbecome painful: the convulsive motions of the respiratory muscles relieve\r\nthe pain for a time; we are, however, unwilling to lose the pleasure, and\r\npresently put a stop to this exertion, and immediately the pleasure recurs,\r\nand again as instantly rises into pain. All of us have felt the pain of\r\nimmoderate laughter; children have been tickled into convulsions of the\r\nwhole body; and others have died in the act of laughing; probably from a\r\nparalysis succeeding the long continued actions of the muscles of\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nHence we learn the reason, why children, who are so easily excited to laugh\r\nby the tickling of other people's fingers, cannot tickle themselves into\r\nlaughter. The exertion of their hands in the endeavour to tickle themselves\r\nprevents the necessity of any exertion of the respiratory muscles to\r\nrelieve the excess of pleasurable affection. See Sect. XVII. 3. 5.\r\n\r\nChrysippus is recorded to have died laughing, when an ass was invited to\r\nsup with him. The same is related of one of the popes, who, when he was\r\nill, saw a tame monkey at his bedside put on the holy thiara. Hall. Phys.\r\nT. III. p. 306.\r\n\r\nThere are instances of epilepsy being produced by laughing recorded by Van\r\nSwieten, T. III. 402 and 308. And it is well known, that many people have\r\ndied instantaneously from the painful excess of joy, which probably might\r\nhave been prevented by the exertions of laughter.\r\n\r\nEvery combination of ideas, which we attend to, occasions pain or pleasure;\r\nthose which occasion pleasure, furnish either social or selfish pleasure,\r\neither malicious or friendly, or lascivious, or sublime pleasure; that is,\r\nthey give us pleasure mixed with other emotions, or they give us unmixed\r\npleasure, without occasioning any other emotions or exertions at the same\r\ntime. This unmixed pleasure, if it be great, becomes painful, like all\r\nother animal motions from stimuli of every kind; and if no other exertions\r\nare occasioned at the same time, we use the exertion of laughter to relieve\r\nthis pain. Hence laughter is occasioned by such wit as excites simple\r\npleasure without any other emotion, such as pity, love, reverence. For\r\nsublime ideas are mixed with admiration, beautiful ones with love, new ones\r\nwith surprise; and these exertions of our ideas prevent the action of\r\nlaughter from being necessary to relieve the painful pleasure above\r\ndescribed. Whence laughable wit consists of frivolous ideas, without\r\nconnections of any consequence, such as puns on words, or on phrases,\r\nincongruous junctions of ideas; on which account laughter is so frequent in\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nUnmixed pleasure less than that, which causes laughter, causes sleep, as in\r\nsinging children to sleep, or in slight intoxication from wine or food. See\r\nSect. XVIII. 12.\r\n\r\n5. If the pains, or disagreeable sensations, above described do not obtain\r\na temporary relief from these convulsive exertions of the muscles, those\r\nconvulsive exertions continue without remission, and one kind of catalepsy\r\nis produced. Thus when a nerve or tendon produces great pain by its being\r\ninflamed or wounded, the patient sets his teeth firmly together, and grins\r\nviolently, to diminish the pain; and if the pain is not relieved by this\r\nexertion, no relaxation of the maxillary muscles takes place, as in the\r\nconvulsions above described, but the jaws remain firmly fixed together.\r\nThis locked jaw is the most frequent instance of cataleptic spasm, because\r\nwe are more inclined to exert the muscles subservient to mastication from\r\ntheir early obedience to violent efforts of volition.\r\n\r\nBut in the case related in Sect. XIX. on Reverie, the cataleptic lady had\r\npain in her upper teeth; and pressing one of her hands vehemently against\r\nher cheek-bone to diminish this pain, it remained in that attitude for\r\nabout half an hour twice a day, till the painful paroxysm was over.\r\n\r\nI have this very day seen a young lady in this disease, (with which she has\r\nfrequently been afflicted,) she began to-day with violent pain shooting\r\nfrom one side of the forehead to the occiput, and after various struggles\r\nlay on the bed with her fingers and wrists bent and stiff for about two\r\nhours; in other respects she seemed in a syncope with a natural pulse. She\r\nthen had intervals of pain and of spasm, and took three grains of opium\r\nevery hour till she had taken nine grains, before the pains and spasm\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another species of fixed spasm, which differs from the\r\nformer, as the pain exists in the contracted muscle, and would seem rather\r\nto be the consequence than the cause of the contraction, as in the cramp in\r\nthe calf of the leg, and in many other parts of the body.\r\n\r\nIn these spasms it should seem, that the muscle itself is first thrown into\r\ncontraction by some disagreeable sensation, as of cold; and that then the\r\nviolent pain is produced by the great contraction of the muscular fibres\r\nextending its own tendons, which are said to be sensible to extension only;\r\nand is further explained in Sect. XVIII. 15.\r\n\r\n6. Many instances have been given in this work, where after violent motions\r\nexcited by irritation, the organ has become quiescent to less, and even to\r\nthe great irritation, which induced it into violent motion; as after\r\nlooking long at the sun or any bright colour, they cease to be seen; and\r\nafter removing from bright day-light into a gloomy room, the eye cannot at\r\nfirst perceive the objects, which stimulate it less. Similar to this is the\r\nsyncope, which succeeds after the violent exertions of our voluntary\r\nmotions, as after epileptic fits, for the power of volition acts in this\r\ncase as the stimulus in the other. This syncope is a temporary palsy, or\r\napoplexy, which ceases after a time, the muscles recovering their power of\r\nbeing excited into action by the efforts of volition; as the eye in the\r\ncircumstance above mentioned recovers in a little time its power of seeing\r\nobjects in a gloomy room; which were invisible immediately after coming out\r\nof a stronger light. This is owing to an accumulation of sensorial power\r\nduring the inaction of those fibres, which were before accustomed to\r\nperpetual exertions, as explained in Sect. XII. 7. 1. A slighter degree of\r\nthis disease is experienced by every one after great fatigue, when the\r\nmuscles gain such inability to further action, that we are obliged to rest\r\nthem for a while, or to summon a greater power of volition to continue\r\ntheir motions.\r\n\r\nIn all the syncopes, which I have seen induced after convulsive fits, the\r\npulse has continued natural, though the organs of sense, as well as the\r\nlocomotive muscles, have ceased to perform their functions; for it is\r\nnecessary for the perception of objects, that the external organs of sense\r\nshould be properly excited by the voluntary power, as the eye-lids must be\r\nopen, and perhaps the muscles of the eye put into action to distend, and\r\nthence give greater pellucidity to the cornea, which in syncope, as in\r\ndeath, appears flat and less transparent.\r\n\r\nThe tympanum of the ear also seems to require a voluntary exertion of its\r\nmuscles, to gain its due tension, and it is probable the other external\r\norgans of sense require a similar voluntary exertion to adapt them to the\r\ndistinct perception of objects. Hence in syncope as in sleep, as the power\r\nof volition is suspended, no external objects are perceived. See Sect.\r\nXVIII. 5. During the time which the patient lies in a fainting fit, the\r\nspirit of animation becomes accumulated; and hence the muscles in a while\r\nbecome irritable by their usual stimulation, and the fainting fit ceases.\r\nSee Sect. XII. 7. 1.\r\n\r\n7. If the exertion of the voluntary motions has been still more energetic,\r\nthe quiescence, which succeeds, is so complete, that they cannot again be\r\nexcited into action by the efforts of the will. In this manner the palsy,\r\nand apoplexy (which is an universal palsy) are frequently produced after\r\nconvulsions, or other violent exertions; of this I shall add a few\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nPlaternus mentions some, who have died apoplectic from violent exertions in\r\ndancing; and Dr. Mead, in his Essay on Poisons, records a patient in the\r\nhydrophobia, who at one effort broke the cords which bound him, and at the\r\nsame instant expired. And it is probable, that those, who have expired from\r\nimmoderate laughter, have died from this paralysis consequent to violent\r\nexertion. Mrs. Scott of Stafford was walking in her garden in perfect\r\nhealth with her neighbour Mrs. ----; the latter accidentally fell into a\r\nmuddy rivulet, and tried in vain to disengage herself by the assistance of\r\nMrs. Scott's hand. Mrs. Scott exerted her utmost power for many minutes,\r\nfirst to assist her friend, and next to prevent herself from being pulled\r\ninto the morass, as her distressed companion would not disengage her hand.\r\nAfter other assistance was procured by their united screams, Mrs. Scott\r\nwalked to a chair about twenty yards from the brook, and was seized with an\r\napoplectic stroke: which continued many days, and terminated in a total\r\nloss of her right arm, and her speech; neither of which she ever after\r\nperfectly recovered.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that many people in Holland have died after skating too long or\r\ntoo violently on their frozen canals; it is probable the death of these,\r\nand of others, who have died suddenly in swimming, has been owing to this\r\ngreat quiescence or paralysis; which has succeeded very violent exertions,\r\nadded to the concomitant cold, which has had greater effect after the\r\nsufferers had been heated and exhausted by previous exercise.\r\n\r\nI remember a young man of the name of Nairne at Cambridge, who walking on\r\nthe edge of a barge fell into the river. His cousin and fellow-student of\r\nthe same name, knowing the other could not swim, plunged into the water\r\nafter him, caught him by his clothes, and approaching the bank by a\r\nvehement exertion propelled him safe to the land, but that instant, seized,\r\nas was supposed, by the cramp, or paralysis, sunk to rise no more. The\r\nreason why the cramp of the muscles, which compose the calf of the leg, is\r\nso liable to affect swimmers, is, because these muscles have very weak\r\nantagonists, and are in walking generally elongated again after their\r\ncontraction by the weight of the body on the ball of the toe, which is very\r\nmuch greater than the resistance of the water in swimming. See Section\r\nXVIII. 15.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that every apoplectic or paralytic attack is immediately\r\npreceded by vehement exertion; the quiescence, which succeeds exertion, and\r\nwhich is not so great as to be termed paralysis, frequently recurs\r\nafterwards at certain periods; and by other causes of quiescence, occurring\r\nwith those periods, as was explained in treating of the paroxysms of\r\nintermitting fevers; the quiescence at length, becomes so great as to be\r\nincapable of again being removed by the efforts of volition, and complete\r\nparalysis is formed. See Section XXXII. 3. 2.\r\n\r\nMany of the paralytic patients, whom I have seen, have evidently had\r\ndiseased livers from the too frequent potation of spirituous liquors; some\r\nof them have had the gutta rosea on their faces and breasts; which has in\r\nsome degree receded either spontaneously, or by the use of external\r\nremedies, and the paralytic stroke has succeeded; and as in several\r\npersons, who have drank much vinous spirits, I have observed epileptic fits\r\nto commence at about forty or fifty years of age, without any hereditary\r\ntaint, from the stimulus, as I believed, of a diseased liver; I was induced\r\nto ascribe many paralytic cases to the same source; which were not\r\nevidently the effect of age, or of unacquired debility. And the account\r\ngiven before of dropsies, which very frequently are owing to a paralysis of\r\nthe absorbent system, and are generally attendant on free drinkers of\r\nspirituous liquors, confirmed me in this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe disagreeable irritation of a diseased liver produces exertions and\r\nconsequent quiescence; these by the accidental concurrence of other causes\r\nof quiescence, as cold, solar or lunar periods, inanition, the want of\r\ntheir usual portion of spirit of wine, at length produces paralysis.\r\n\r\nThis is further confirmed by observing, that the muscles, we most\r\nfrequently, or most powerfully exert, are most liable to palsy; as those of\r\nthe voice and of articulation, and of those paralytics which I have seen, a\r\nmuch greater proportion have lost the use of their right arm; which is so\r\nmuch more generally exerted than the left.\r\n\r\nI cannot dismiss this subject without observing, that after a paralytic\r\nstroke, if the vital powers are not much injured, that the patient has all\r\nthe movements of the affected limb to learn over again, just as in early\r\ninfancy; the limb is first moved by the irritation of its muscles, as in\r\nstretching, (of which a case was related in Section VII. 1. 3.) or by the\r\nelectric concussion; afterwards it becomes obedient to sensation, as in\r\nviolent danger or fear; and lastly, the muscles become again associated\r\nwith volition, and gradually acquire their usual habits of acting together.\r\n\r\nAnother phænomenon in palsies is, that when the limbs of one side are\r\ndisabled, those of the other are in perpetual motion. This can only be\r\nexplained from conceiving that the power of motion, whatever it is, or\r\nwherever it resides, and which is capable of being exhausted by fatigue,\r\nand accumulated in rest, is now less expended, whilst one half of the body\r\nis capable of receiving its usual proportion of it, and is hence derived\r\nwith greater ease or in greater abundance into the limbs, which remain\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The excess or defect of voluntary exertion produces similar effects\r\nupon the sensual motions, or ideas of the mind, as those already mentioned\r\nupon the muscular fibres. Thus when any violent pain, arising from the\r\ndefect of some peculiar stimulus, exists either in the muscular or sensual\r\nsystems of fibres, and which cannot be removed by acquiring the defective\r\nstimulus; as in some constitutions convulsions of the muscles are produced\r\nto procure a temporary relief, so in other constitutions vehement voluntary\r\nexertions of the ideas of the mind are produced for the same purpose; for\r\nduring this exertion, like that of the muscles, the pain either vanishes or\r\nis diminished: this violent exertion constitutes madness; and in many cases\r\nI have seen the madness take place, and the convulsions cease, and\r\nreciprocally the madness cease, and the convulsions supervene. See Section\r\nIII. 5. 8.\r\n\r\n2. Madness is distinguishable from delirium, as in the latter the patient\r\nknows not the place where he resides, nor the persons of his friends or\r\nattendants, nor is conscious of any external objects, except when spoken to\r\nwith a louder voice, or stimulated with unusual force, and even then he\r\nsoon relapses into a state of inattention to every thing about him. Whilst\r\nin the former he is perfectly sensible to every thing external, but has the\r\nvoluntary powers of his mind intensely exerted on some particular object of\r\nhis desire or aversion, he harbours in his thoughts a suspicion of all\r\nmankind, lest they should counteract his designs; and while he keeps his\r\nintentions, and the motives of his actions profoundly secret; he is\r\nperpetually studying the means of acquiring the object of his wish, or of\r\npreventing or revenging the injuries he suspects.\r\n\r\n3. A late French philosopher, Mr. Helvetius, has deduced almost all our\r\nactions from this principle of their relieving us from the ennui or tædium\r\nvitæ; and true it is, that our desires or aversions are the motives of all\r\nour voluntary actions; and human nature seems to excel other animals in the\r\nmore facil use of this voluntary power, and on that account is more liable\r\nto insanity than other animals. But in mania this violent exertion of\r\nvolition is expended on mistaken objects, and would not be relieved, though\r\nwe were to gain or escape the objects, that excite it. Thus I have seen two\r\ninstances of madmen, who conceived that they had the itch, and several have\r\nbelieved they had the venereal infection, without in reality having a\r\nsymptom of either of them. They have been perpetually thinking upon this\r\nsubject, and some of them were in vain salivated with design of convincing\r\nthem to the contrary.\r\n\r\n4. In the minds of mad people those volitions alone exist, which are\r\nunmixed with sensation; immoderate suspicion is generally the first\r\nsymptom, and want of shame, and want of delicacy about cleanliness.\r\nSuspicion is a voluntary exertion of the mind arising from the pain of\r\nfear, which it is exerted to relieve: shame is the name of a peculiar\r\ndisagreeable sensation, see Fable of the Bees, and delicacy about\r\ncleanliness arises from another disagreeable sensation. And therefore are\r\nnot found in the minds of maniacs, which are employed solely in voluntary\r\nexertions. Hence the most modest women in this disease walk naked amongst\r\nmen without any kind of concern, use obscene discourse, and have no\r\ndelicacy about their natural evacuations.\r\n\r\n5. Nor are maniacal people more attentive to their natural appetites, or to\r\nthe irritations which surround them, except as far as may respect their\r\nsuspicions or designs; for the violent and perpetual exertions of their\r\nvoluntary powers of mind prevents their perception of almost every other\r\nobject, either of irritation or of sensation. Hence it is that they bear\r\ncold, hunger, and fatigue, with much greater pertinacity than in their\r\nsober hours, and are less injured by them in respect to their general\r\nhealth. Thus it is asserted by historians, that Charles the Twelfth of\r\nSweden slept on the snow, wrapped only in his cloak, at the siege of\r\nFrederickstad, and bore extremes of cold and hunger, and fatigue, under\r\nwhich numbers of his soldiers perished; because the king was insane with\r\nambition, but the soldier had no such powerful stimulus to preserve his\r\nsystem from debility and death.\r\n\r\n6. Besides the insanities arising from exertions in consequence of pain,\r\nthere is also a pleasurable insanity, as well as a pleasurable delirium; as\r\nthe insanity of personal vanity, and that of religious fanaticism. When\r\nagreeable ideas excite into motion the sensorial power of sensation, and\r\nthis again causes other trains of agreeable ideas, a constant stream of\r\npleasurable ideas succeeds, and produces pleasurable delirium. So when the\r\nsensorial power of volition excites agreeable ideas, and the pleasure thus\r\nproduced excites more volition in its turn, a constant flow of agreeable\r\nvoluntary ideas succeeds; which when thus exerted in the extreme\r\nconstitutes insanity.\r\n\r\nThus when our muscular actions are excited by our sensations of pleasure,\r\nit is termed play; when they are excited by our volition, it is termed\r\nwork; and the former of these is attended with less fatigue, because the\r\nmuscular actions in play produce in their turn more pleasurable sensation;\r\nwhich again has the property of producing more muscular action. An\r\nagreeable instance of this I saw this morning. A little boy, who was tired\r\nwith walking, begged of his papa to carry him. \"Here,\" says the reverend\r\ndoctor, \"ride upon my gold-headed cane;\" and the pleased child, putting it\r\nbetween his legs, gallopped away with delight, and complained no more of\r\nhis fatigue. Here the aid of another sensorial power, that of pleasurable\r\nsensation, superadded vigour to the exertion of exhausted volition. Which\r\ncould otherwise only have been excited by additional pain, as by the lash\r\nof slavery. On this account where the whole sensorial power has been\r\nexerted on the contemplation of the promised joys of heaven, the saints of\r\nall persecuted religions have borne the tortures of martyrdom with\r\notherwise unaccountable firmness.\r\n\r\n7. There are some diseases, which obtain at least a temporary relief from\r\nthe exertions of insanity; many instances of dropsies being thus for a time\r\ncured are recorded. An elderly woman labouring with ascites I twice saw\r\nrelieved for some weeks by insanity, the dropsy ceased for several weeks,\r\nand recurred again alternating with the insanity. A man afflicted with\r\ndifficult respiration on lying down, with very irregular pulse, and\r\noedematous legs, whom I saw this day, has for above a week been much\r\nrelieved in respect to all those symptoms by the accession of insanity,\r\nwhich is shewn by inordinate suspicion, and great anger.\r\n\r\nIn cases of common temporary anger the increased action of the arterial\r\nsystem is seen by the red skin, and increased pulse, with the immediate\r\nincrease of muscular activity. A friend of mine, when he was painfully\r\nfatigued by riding on horseback, was accustomed to call up ideas into his\r\nmind, which used to excite his anger or indignation, and thus for a time at\r\nleast relieved the pain of fatigue. By this temporary insanity, the effect\r\nof the voluntary power upon the whole of his system was increased; as in\r\nthe cases of dropsy above mentioned, it would appear, that the increased\r\naction of the voluntary faculty of the sensorium affected the absorbent\r\nsystem, as well as the secerning one.\r\n\r\n8. In respect to relieving inflammatory pains, and removing fever, I have\r\nseen many instances, as mentioned in Sect. XII. 2. 4. One lady, whom I\r\nattended, had twice at some years interval a locked jaw, which relieved a\r\npain on her sternum with peripneumony. Two other ladies I saw, who towards\r\nthe end of violent peripneumony, in which they frequently lost blood, were\r\nat length cured by insanity supervening. In the former the increased\r\nvoluntary exertion of the muscles of the jaw, in the latter that of the\r\norgans of sense, removed the disease; that is, the disagreeable sensation,\r\nwhich had produced the inflammation, now excited the voluntary power, and\r\nthese new voluntary exertions employed or expended the superabundant\r\nsensorial power, which had previously been exerted on the arterial system,\r\nand caused inflammation.\r\n\r\nAnother case, which I think worth relating, was of a young man about\r\ntwenty; he had laboured under an irritative fever with debility for three\r\nor four weeks, with very quick and very feeble pulse, and other usual\r\nsymptoms of that species of typhus, but at this time complained much and\r\nfrequently of pain of his legs and feet. When those who attended him were\r\nnearly in despair of his recovery, I observed with pleasure an insanity of\r\nmind supervene: which was totally different from delirium, as he knew his\r\nfriends, calling them by their names, and the room in which he lay, but\r\nbecame violently suspicious of his attendants, and calumniated with\r\nvehement oaths his tender mother, who sat weeping by his bed. On this his\r\npulse became slower and firmer, but the quickness did not for some time\r\nintirely cease, and he gradually recovered. In this case the introduction\r\nof an increased quantity of the power of volition gave vigour to those\r\nmovements of the system, which are generally only actuated by the power of\r\nirritation, and of association.\r\n\r\nAnother case I recollect of a young man, about twenty-five, who had the\r\nscarlet-fever, with very quick pulse, and an universal eruption on his\r\nskin, and was not without reason esteemed to be in great danger of his\r\nlife. After a few days an insanity supervened, which his friends mistook\r\nfor delirium, and he gradually recovered, and the cuticle peeled off. From\r\nthese and a few other cases I have always esteemed insanity to be a\r\nfavourable sign in fevers, and have cautiously distinguished it from\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\nIII. Another mode of mental exertion to relieve pain, is by producing a\r\ntrain of ideas not only by the efforts of volition, as in insanity; but by\r\nthose of sensation likewise, as in delirium and sleep. This mental effort\r\nis termed reverie, or somnambulation, and is described more at large in\r\nSect. XIX. on that subject. But I shall here relate another case of that\r\nwonderful disease, which fell yesterday under my eye, and to which I have\r\nseen many analogous alienations of mind, though not exactly similar in all\r\ncircumstances. But as all of them either began or terminated with pain or\r\nconvulsion, there can be no doubt but that they are of epileptic origin,\r\nand constitute another mode of mental exertion to relieve some painful\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\n1. Master A. about nine years old, had been seized at seven every morning\r\nfor ten days with uncommon fits, and had had slight returns in the\r\nafternoon. They were supposed to originate from worms, and had been in vain\r\nattempted to be removed by vermifuge purges. As his fit was expected at\r\nseven yesterday morning, I saw him before that hour; he was asleep, seemed\r\nfree from pain, and his pulse natural. About seven he began to complain of\r\npain about his navel, or more to the left side, and in a few minutes had\r\nexertions of his arms and legs like swimming. He then for half an hour\r\nhunted a pack of hounds; as appeared by his hallooing, and calling the dogs\r\nby their names, and discoursing with the attendants of the chase,\r\ndescribing exactly a day of hunting, which (I was informed) he had\r\nwitnessed a year before, going through all the most minute circumstances of\r\nit; calling to people, who were then present, and lamenting the absence of\r\nothers, who were then also absent. After this scene he imitated, as he lay\r\nin bed, some of the plays of boys, as swimming and jumping. He then sung an\r\nEnglish and then an Italian song; part of which with his eyes open, and\r\npart with them closed, but could not be awakened or excited by any\r\nviolence, which it was proper to use.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour he came suddenly to himself with apparent surprise, and\r\nseemed quite ignorant of any part of what had passed, and after being\r\napparently well for half an hour, he suddenly fell into a great stupor,\r\nwith slower pulse than natural, and a slow moaning respiration, in which he\r\ncontinued about another half hour, and then recovered.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of this disease was favourable; he was directed one grain of\r\nopium at six every morning, and then to rise out of bed; at half past six\r\nhe was directed fifteen drops of laudanum in a glass of wine and water. The\r\nfirst day the paroxysm became shorter, and less violent. The dose of opium\r\nwas increased to one-half more, and in three or four days the fits left\r\nhim. The bark and filings of iron were also exhibited twice a day; and I\r\nbelieve the complaint returned no more.\r\n\r\n2. In this paroxysm it must be observed, that he began with pain, and ended\r\nwith stupor, in both circumstances resembling a fit of epilepsy. And that\r\ntherefore the exertions both of mind and body, both the voluntary ones, and\r\nthose immediately excited by pleasurable sensation, were exertions to\r\nrelieve pain.\r\n\r\nThe hunting scene appeared to be rather an act of memory than of\r\nimagination, and was therefore rather a voluntary exertion, though attended\r\nwith the pleasurable eagerness, which was the consequence of those ideas\r\nrecalled by recollection, and not the cause of them.\r\n\r\nThese ideas thus voluntarily recollected were succeeded by sensations of\r\npleasure, though his senses were unaffected by the stimuli of visible or\r\naudible objects; or so weakly excited by them as not to produce sensation\r\nor attention. And the pleasure thus excited by volition produced other\r\nideas and other motions in consequence of the sensorial power of sensation.\r\nWhence the mixed catenations of voluntary and sensitive ideas and muscular\r\nmotions in reverie; which, like every other kind of vehement exertion,\r\ncontribute to relieve pain, by expending a large quantity of sensorial\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThose fits generally commence during sleep, from whence I suppose they have\r\nbeen thought to have some connection with sleep, and have thence been\r\ntermed Somnambulism; but their commencement during sleep is owing to our\r\nincreased excitability by internal sensations at that time, as explained in\r\nSect. XVIII. 14. and 15., and not to any similitude between reverie and\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n3. I was once concerned for a very elegant and ingenious young lady, who\r\nhad a reverie on alternate days, which continued nearly the whole day; and\r\nas in her days of disease she took up the same kind of ideas, which she had\r\nconversed about on the alternate day before, and could recollect nothing of\r\nthem on her well-day; she appeared to her friends to possess two minds.\r\nThis case also was of epileptic kind, and was cured, with some relapses, by\r\nopium administered before the commencement of the paroxysm.\r\n\r\n4. Whence it appears, that the methods of relieving inflammatory pains, is\r\nby removing all stimulus, as by venesection, cool air, mucilaginous diet,\r\naqueous potation, silence, darkness.\r\n\r\nThe methods of relieving pains from defect of stimulus is by supplying the\r\npeculiar stimulus required, as of food, or warmth.\r\n\r\nAnd the general method of relieving pain is by exciting into action some\r\ngreat part of the system for the purpose of expending a part of the\r\nsensorial power. This is done either by exertion of the voluntary ideas and\r\nmuscles, as in insanity and convulsion; or by exerting both voluntary and\r\nsensitive motions, as in reverie; or by exciting the irritative motions by\r\nwine or opium internally, and by the warm bath or blisters externally; or\r\nlastly, by exciting the sensitive ideas by good news, affecting stories, or\r\nagreeable passions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXV.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n    I. 1. _Sympathy or consent of parts. Primary and secondary parts of an\r\n    associated train of motions reciprocally affect each other. Parts of\r\n    irritative trains of motion affect each other in four ways. Sympathies\r\n    of the skin and stomach. Flushing of the face after a meal. Eruption of\r\n    the small-pox on the face. Chilness after a meal._ 2. _Vertigo from\r\n    intoxication._ 3. _Absorption from the lungs and pericardium by\r\n    emetics. In vomiting the actions of the stomach are decreased, not\r\n    increased. Digestion strengthened after an emetic. Vomiting from\r\n    deficiency of sensorial power._ 4. _Dyspnoea from cold bathing. Slow\r\n    pulse from digitalis. Death from gout in the stomach._ II. 1. _Primary\r\n    and secondary parts of sensitive associations affect each other. Pain\r\n    from gall-stone, from urinary stone, Hemicrania. Painful epilepsy._ 2.\r\n    _Gout and red face from inflamed liver. Shingles from inflamed kidney._\r\n    3. _Coryza from cold applied to the feet. Pleurisy. Hepatitis._ 4.\r\n    _Pain of shoulders from inflamed liver._ III. _Diseases from the\r\n    associations of ideas._\r\n\r\nI. 1. Many synchronous and successive motions of our muscular fibres, and\r\nof our organs of sense, or ideas, become associated so as to form\r\nindissoluble tribes or trains of action, as shewn in Section X. on\r\nAssociate Motions. Some constitutions more easily establish these\r\nassociations, whether by voluntary, sensitive, or irritative repetitions,\r\nand some more easily lose them again, as shewn in Section XXXI. on\r\nTemperaments.\r\n\r\nWhen the beginning of such a train of actions becomes by any means\r\ndisordered, the succeeding part is liable to become disturbed in\r\nconsequence, and this is commonly termed sympathy or consent of parts by\r\nthe writers of medicine. For the more clear understanding of these\r\nsympathies we must consider a tribe or train of actions as divided into two\r\nparts, and call one of them the primary or original motions, and the other\r\nthe secondary or sympathetic ones.\r\n\r\nThe primary and secondary parts of a train of irritative actions may\r\nreciprocally affect each other in four different manners. 1. They may both\r\nbe exerted with greater energy than natural. 2. The former may act with\r\ngreater, and the latter with less energy. 3. The former may act with less,\r\nand the latter with greater energy. 4. They may both act with less energy\r\nthan natural. I shall now give an example of each kind of these modes of\r\naction, and endeavour to shew, that though the primary and secondary parts\r\nof these trains or tribes of motion are connected by irritative\r\nassociation, or their previous habits of acting together, as described in\r\nSect. XX. on Vertigo. Yet that their acting with similar or dissimilar\r\ndegrees of energy, depends on the greater or less quantity of sensorial\r\npower, which the primary part of the train expends in its exertions.\r\n\r\nThe actions of the stomach constitute so important a part of the\r\nassociations of both irritative and sensitive motions, that it is said to\r\nsympathize with almost every part of the body; the first example, which I\r\nshall adduce to shew that both the primary and secondary parts of a train\r\nof irritative associations of motion act with increased energy, is taken\r\nfrom the consent of the skin with this organ. When the action of the fibres\r\nof the stomach is increased, as by the stimulus of a full meal, the\r\nexertions of the cutaneous arteries of the face become increased by their\r\nirritative associations with those of the stomach, and a glow or flushing\r\nof the face succeeds. For the small vessels of the skin of the face having\r\nbeen more accustomed to the varieties of action, from their frequent\r\nexposure to various degrees of cold and heat become more easily excited\r\ninto increased action, than those of the covered parts of our bodies, and\r\nthus act with more energy from their irritative or sensitive associations\r\nwith the stomach. On this account in small-pox the eruption in consequence\r\nof the previous affection of the stomach breaks out a day sooner on the\r\nface than on the hands, and two days sooner than on the trunk, and recedes\r\nin similar times after maturation.\r\n\r\nBut secondly, in weaker constitutions, that is, in those who possess less\r\nsensorial power, so much of it is expended in the increased actions of the\r\nfibres of the stomach excited by the stimulus of a meal, that a sense of\r\nchilness succeeds instead of the universal glow above mentioned; and thus\r\nthe secondary part of the associated train of motions is diminished in\r\nenergy, in consequence of the increased activity of the primary part of it.\r\n\r\n2. Another instance of a similar kind, where the secondary part of the\r\ntrain acts with less energy in consequence of the greater exertions of the\r\nprimary part, is the vertigo attending intoxication; in this circumstance\r\nso much sensorial power is expended on the stomach, and on its nearest or\r\nmore strongly associated motions, as those of the subcutaneous vessels, and\r\nprobably of the membranes of some internal viscera, that the irritative\r\nmotions of the retina become imperfectly exerted from deficiency of\r\nsensorial power, as explained in Sect. XX. and XXI. 3. on Vertigo and on\r\nDrunkenness, and hence the staggering inebriate cannot completely balance\r\nhimself by such indistinct vision.\r\n\r\n3. An instance of the third circumstance, where the primary part of a train\r\nof irritative motions acts with less, and the secondary part with greater\r\nenergy, may be observed by making the following experiment. If a person\r\nlies with his arms and shoulders out of bed, till they become cold, a\r\ntemporary coryza or catarrh is produced; so that the passage of the\r\nnostrils becomes totally obstructed; at least this happens to many people;\r\nand then on covering the arms and shoulders, till they become warm, the\r\npassage of the nostrils ceases again to be obstructed, and a quantity of\r\nmucus is discharged from them. In this case the quiescence of the vessels\r\nof the skin of the arms and shoulders, occasioned by exposure to cold air,\r\nproduces by irritative association an increased action of the vessels of\r\nthe membrane of the nostrils; and the accumulation of sensorial power\r\nduring the torpor of the arms and shoulders is thus expended in producing a\r\ntemporary coryza or catarrh.\r\n\r\nAnother instance may be adduced from the sympathy or consent of the motions\r\nof the stomach with other more distant links of the very extensive tribes\r\nor trains of irritative motions associated with them, described in Sect.\r\nXX. on Vertigo. When the actions of the fibres of the stomach are\r\ndiminished or inverted, the actions of the absorbent vessels, which take up\r\nthe mucus from the lungs, pericardium, and other cells of the body, become\r\nincreased, and absorb the fluids accumulated in them with greater avidity,\r\nas appears from the exhibition of foxglove, antimony, or other emetics in\r\ncases of anasarca, attended with unequal pulse and difficult respiration.\r\n\r\nThat the act of nausea and vomiting is a decreased exertion of the fibres\r\nof the stomach may be thus deduced; when an emetic medicine is\r\nadministered, it produces the pain of sickness, as a disagreeable taste in\r\nthe mouth produces the pain of nausea; these pains, like that of hunger, or\r\nof cold, or like those, which are usually termed nervous, as the head-ach\r\nor hemicrania, do not excite the organ into greater action; but in this\r\ncase I imagine the pains of sickness or of nausea counteract or destroy the\r\npleasurable sensation, which seems necessary to digestion, as shewn in\r\nSect. XXXIII. 1. 1. The peristaltic motions of the fibres of the stomach\r\nbecome enfeebled by the want of this stimulus of pleasurable sensation, and\r\nin consequence stop for a time, and then become inverted; for they cannot\r\nbecome inverted without being previously stopped. Now that this inversion\r\nof the trains of motion of the fibres of the stomach is owing to the\r\ndeficiency of pleasurable sensation is evinced from this circumstance, that\r\na nauseous idea excited by words will produce vomiting as effectually us a\r\nnauseous drug.\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that the act of nausea or vomiting expends less sensorial\r\npower than the usual peristaltic motions of the stomach in the digestion of\r\nour aliment; and that hence there is a greater quantity of sensorial power\r\nbecomes accumulated in the fibres of the stomach, and more of it in\r\nconsequence to spare for the action of those parts of the system, which are\r\nthus associated with the stomach, as of the whole absorbent series of\r\nvessels, and which are at the same time excited by their usual stimuli.\r\n\r\nFrom this we can understand, how after the operation of an emetic the\r\nstomach becomes more irritable and sensible to the stimulus, and the\r\npleasure of food; since as the sensorial power becomes accumulated during\r\nthe nausea and vomiting, the digestive power is afterwards exerted more\r\nforceably for a time. It should, however, be here remarked, that though\r\nvomiting is in general produced by the defect of this stimulus of\r\npleasurable sensation, as when a nauseous drug is administered; yet in long\r\ncontinued vomiting, as in sea-sickness, or from habitual dram-drinking, it\r\narises from deficiency of sensorial power, which in the former case is\r\nexhausted by the increased exertion of the irritative ideas of vision, and\r\nin the latter by the frequent application of an unnatural stimulus.\r\n\r\n4. An example of the fourth circumstance above mentioned, where both the\r\nprimary and secondary parts of a train of motions proceed with energy less\r\nthan natural, may be observed in the dyspnoea, which occurs in going into a\r\nvery cold bath, and which has been described and explained in Sect. XXXII.\r\n3. 2.\r\n\r\nAnd by the increased debility of the pulsations of the heart and arteries\r\nduring the operation of an emetic. Secondly, from the slowness and\r\nintermission of the pulsations of the heart from the incessant efforts to\r\nvomit occasioned by an overdose of digitalis. And thirdly, from the total\r\nstoppage of the motions of the heart, or death, in consequence of the\r\ntorpor of the stomach, when affected with the commencement or cold paroxysm\r\nof the gout. See Sect. XXV. 17.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The primary and secondary parts of the trains of sensitive\r\nassociation reciprocally affect each other in different manners. 1. The\r\nincreased sensation of the primary part may cease, when that of the\r\nsecondary part commences. 2. The increased action of the primary part may\r\ncease, when that of the secondary part commences. 3. The primary part may\r\nhave increased sensation, and the secondary part increased action. 4. The\r\nprimary part may have increased action, and the secondary part increased\r\nsensation.\r\n\r\nExamples of the first mode, where the increased sensation of the primary\r\npart of a train of sensitive association ceases, when that of the secondary\r\npart commences, are not unfrequent; as this is the general origin of those\r\npains, which continue some time without being attended with inflammation,\r\nsuch as the pain at the pit of the stomach from a stone at the neck of the\r\ngall-bladder, and the pain of strangury in the glans penis from a stone at\r\nthe neck of the urinary bladder. In both these cases the part, which is\r\naffected secondarily, is believed to be much more sensible than the part\r\nprimarily affected, as described in the catalogue of diseases, Class II. 1.\r\n1. 11. and IV. 2. 2. 2. and IV. 2. 2. 4.\r\n\r\nThe hemicrania, or nervous headach, as it is called, when it originates\r\nfrom a decaying tooth, is another disease of this kind; as the pain of the\r\ncarious tooth always ceases, when the pain over one eye and temple\r\ncommences. And it is probable, that the violent pains, which induce\r\nconvulsions in painful epilepsies, are produced in the same manner, from a\r\nmore sensible part sympathizing with a diseased one of less sensibility.\r\nSee Catalogue of Diseases, Class IV. 2. 2. 8. and III. 1. 1. 6.\r\n\r\nThe last tooth, or dens sapientiæ, of the upper jaw most frequently decays\r\nfirst, and is liable to produce pain over the eye and temple of that side.\r\nThe last tooth of the under-jaw is also liable to produce a similar\r\nhemicrania, when it begins to decay. When a tooth in the upper-jaw is the\r\ncause of the headach, a slighter pain is sometimes perceived on the\r\ncheek-bone. And when a tooth in the lower-jaw is the cause of headach, a\r\npain sometimes affects the tendons of the muscles of the neck, which are\r\nattached near the jaws. But the clavus hystericus, or pain about the middle\r\nof the parietal bone on one side of the head, I have seen produced by the\r\nsecond of the molares, or grinders, of the under-jaw; of which I shall\r\nrelate the following case. See Class IV. 2. 2. 8.\r\n\r\nMrs. ----, about 30 years of age, was seized with great pain about the\r\nmiddle of the right parietal bone, which had continued a whole day before I\r\nsaw her, and was so violent as to threaten to occasion convulsions. Not\r\nbeing able to detect a decaying tooth, or a tender one, by examination with\r\nmy eye, or by striking them with a tea-spoon, and fearing bad consequences\r\nfrom her tendency to convulsion, I advised her to extract the last tooth of\r\nthe under-jaw on the affected side; which was done without any good effect.\r\nShe was then directed to lose blood, and to take a brisk cathartic; and\r\nafter that had operated, about 60 drops of laudanum were given her, with\r\nlarge doses of bark; by which the pain was removed. In about a fortnight\r\nshe took a cathartic medicine by ill advice, and the pain returned with\r\ngreater violence in the same place; and, before I could arrive, as she\r\nlived 30 miles from me, she suffered a paralytic stroke; which affected her\r\nlimbs and her face on one side, and relieved the pain of her head.\r\n\r\nAbout a year afterwards I was again called to her on account of a pain as\r\nviolent as before exactly on the same part of the other parietal bone. On\r\nexamining her mouth I found the second molaris of the under-jaw on the side\r\nbefore affected was now decayed, and concluded, that this tooth had\r\noccasioned the stroke of the palsy by the pain and consequent exertion it\r\nhad caused. On this account I earnestly entreated her to allow the sound\r\nmolaris of the same jaw opposite to the decayed one to be extracted; which\r\nwas forthwith done, and the pain of her head immediately ceased, to the\r\nastonishment of her attendants.\r\n\r\nIn the cases above related of the pain existing in a part distant from the\r\nseat of the disease, the pain is owing to defect of the usual motions of\r\nthe painful part. This appears from the coldness, paleness, and emptiness\r\nof the affected vessels, or of the extremities of the body in general, and\r\nfrom there being no tendency to inflammation. The increased action of the\r\nprimary part of these associated motions, as of the hepatic termination of\r\nthe bile-duct; from the stimulus of a gall-stone, or of the interior\r\ntermination of the urethra from the stimulus of a stone in the bladder, or\r\nlastly, of a decaying tooth in hemicrania, deprives the secondary part of\r\nthese associated motions, namely, the exterior terminations of the\r\nbile-duct or urethra, or the pained membranes of the head in hemicrania, of\r\ntheir natural share of sensorial power: and hence the secondary parts of\r\nthese sensitive trains of association become pained from the deficiency of\r\ntheir usual motions, which is accompanied with deficiency of secretions and\r\nof heat. See Sect. IV. 5. XII. 5. 3. XXXIV. 1.\r\n\r\nWhy does the pain of the primary part of the association cease, when that\r\nof the secondary part commences? This is a question of intricacy, but\r\nperhaps not inexplicable. The pain of the primary part of these associated\r\ntrains of motion was owing to too great stimulus, as of the stone at the\r\nneck of the bladder, and was consequently caused by too great action of the\r\npained part. This greater action than natural of the primary part of these\r\nassociated motions, by employing or expending the sensorial power of\r\nirritation belonging to the whole associated train of motions, occasioned\r\ntorpor, and consequent pain in the secondary part of the associated train;\r\nwhich was possessed of greater sensibility than the primary part of it. Now\r\nthe great pain of the secondary part of the train, as soon as it commences,\r\nemploys or expends the sensorial power of sensation belonging to the whole\r\nassociated train of motions; and in consequence the motions of the primary\r\npart, though increased by the stimulus of an extraneous body, cease to be\r\naccompanied with pain or sensation.\r\n\r\nIf this mode of reasoning be just it explains a curious fact, why when two\r\nparts of the body are strongly stimulated, the pain is felt only in one of\r\nthem, though it is possible by voluntary attention it may be alternately\r\nperceived in them both. In the same manner, when two new ideas are\r\npresented to us from the stimulus of external bodies, we attend to but one\r\nof them at a time. In other words, when one set of fibres, whether of the\r\nmuscles or organs of sense, contract so strongly as to excite much\r\nsensation; another set of fibres contracting more weakly do not excite\r\nsensation at all, because the sensorial power of sensation is pre-occupied\r\nby the first set of fibres. So we cannot will more than one effect at once,\r\nthough by associations previously formed we can move many fibres in\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nThus in the instances above related, the termination of the bile duct in\r\nthe duodenum, and the exterior extremity of the urethra, are more sensible\r\nthan their other terminations. When these parts are deprived of their usual\r\nmotions by deficiency of sensorial power, as above explained, they become\r\npainful according to law the fifth in Section IV. and the less pain\r\noriginally excited by the stimulus of concreted bile, or of a stone at\r\ntheir other extremities ceases to be perceived. Afterwards, however, when\r\nthe concretions of bile, or the stone on the urinary bladder, become more\r\nnumerous or larger, the pain from their increased stimulus becomes greater\r\nthan the associated pain; and is then felt at the neck of the gall bladder\r\nor urinary bladder; and the pain of the glans penis, or at the pit of the\r\nstomach, ceases to be perceived.\r\n\r\n2. Examples of the second mode, where the increased action of the primary\r\npart of a train of sensitive association ceases, when that of the secondary\r\npart commences, are also not unfrequent; as this is the usual manner of the\r\ntranslation of inflammations from internal to external parts of the system,\r\nsuch as when an inflammation of the liver or stomach is translated to the\r\nmembranes of the foot, and forms the gout; or to the skin of the face, and\r\nforms the rosy drop; or when an inflammation of the membranes of the\r\nkidneys is translated to the skin of the loins, and forms one kind of\r\nherpes, called shingles; in these cases by whatever cause the original\r\ninflammation may have been produced, as the secondary part of the train of\r\nsensitive association is more sensible, it becomes exerted with greater\r\nviolence than the first part of it; and by both its increased pain, and the\r\nincreased motion of its fibres, so far diminishes or exhausts the sensorial\r\npower of sensation; that the primary part of the train being less sensible\r\nceases both to feel pain, and to act with unnatural energy.\r\n\r\n3. Examples of the third mode, where the primary part of a train of\r\nsensitive association of motions may experience increased sensation, and\r\nthe secondary part increased action, are likewise not unfrequent; as it is\r\nin this manner that most inflammations commence. Thus, after standing some\r\ntime in snow, the feet become affected with the pain of cold, and a common\r\ncoryza, or inflammation of the membrane of the nostrils, succeeds. It is\r\nprobable that the internal inflammations, as pleurisies, or hepatitis,\r\nwhich are produced after the cold paroxysm of fever, originate in the same\r\nmanner from the sympathy of those parts with some others, which were\r\npreviously pained from quiescence; as happens to various parts of the\r\nsystem during the cold fits of fevers. In these cases it would seem, that\r\nthe sensorial power of sensation becomes accumulated during the pain of\r\ncold, as the torpor of the vessels occasioned by the defect of heat\r\ncontributes to the increase or accumulation of the sensorial power of\r\nirritation, and that both these become exerted on some internal part, which\r\nwas not rendered torpid by the cold which affected the external parts, nor\r\nby its association with them; or which sooner recovered its sensibility.\r\nThis requires further consideration.\r\n\r\n4. An example of the fourth mode, or where the primary part of a sensitive\r\nassociation of motions may have increased action, and the secondary part\r\nincreased sensation, may be taken from the pain of the shoulder, which\r\nattends inflammation of the membranes of the liver, see Class IV. 2. 2. 9.;\r\nin this circumstance so much sensorial power seems to be expended in the\r\nviolent actions and sensations of the inflamed membranes of the liver, that\r\nthe membranes associated with them become quiescent to their usual stimuli,\r\nand painful in consequence.\r\n\r\nThere may be other modes in which the primary and secondary parts of the\r\ntrains of associated sensitive motions may reciprocally affect each other,\r\nas may be seen by looking over Class IV. in the catalogue of diseases; all\r\nwhich may probably be resolved into the plus and minus of sensorial power,\r\nbut we have not yet had sufficient observations made upon them with a view\r\nto this doctrine.\r\n\r\nIII. The associated trains of our ideas may have sympathies, and their\r\nprimary and secondary parts affect each other in some manner similar to\r\nthose above described; and may thus occasion various curious phenomena not\r\nyet adverted to, besides those explained in the Sections on Dreams,\r\nReveries, Vertigo, and Drunkenness; and may thus disturb the deductions of\r\nour reasonings, as well as the streams of our imaginations; present us with\r\nfalse degrees of fear, attach unfounded value to trivial circumstances;\r\ngive occasion to our early prejudices and antipathies; and thus embarrass\r\nthe happiness of our lives. A copious and curious harvest might be reaped\r\nfrom this province of science, in which, however, I shall not at present\r\nwield my sickle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVI.\r\n\r\nOF THE PERIODS OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\n    I. _Muscles excited by volition soon cease to contract, or by\r\n    sensation, or by irritation, owing to the exhaustion of sensorial\r\n    power. Muscles subjected to less stimulus have their sensorial power\r\n    accumulated. Hence the periods of some fevers. Want of irritability\r\n    after intoxication._ II. 1. _Natural actions catenated with daily\r\n    habits of life._ 2. _With solar periods. Periods of sleep. Of\r\n    evacuating the bowels._ 3. _Natural actions catenated with lunar\r\n    periods. Menstruation. Venereal orgasm of animals. Barrenness._ III.\r\n    _Periods of diseased animal actions from stated returns of nocturnal\r\n    cold, from solar and lunar influence. Periods of diurnal fever, hectic\r\n    fever, quotidian, tertian, quartan fever. Periods of gout, pleurisy, of\r\n    fevers with arterial debility, and with arterial strength, Periods of\r\n    rhaphania, of nervous cough, hemicrania, arterial hæmorrhages,\r\n    hæmorrhoids, hæmoptoe, epilepsy, palsy, apoplexy, madness._ IV.\r\n    _Critical days depend on lunar periods. Lunar periods in the small\r\n    pox._\r\n\r\nI. If any of our muscles be made to contract violently by the power of\r\nvolition, as those of the fingers, when any one hangs by his hands on a\r\nswing, fatigue soon ensues; and the muscles cease to act owing to the\r\ntemporary exhaustion of the spirit of animation; as soon as this is again\r\naccumulated in the muscles, they are ready to contract again by the efforts\r\nof volition.\r\n\r\nThose violent muscular actions induced by pain become in the same manner\r\nintermitted and recurrent; as in labour-pains, vomiting, tenesmus,\r\nstrangury; owing likewise to the temporary exhaustion of the spirit of\r\nanimation, as above mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhen any stimulus continues long to act with unnatural violence, so as to\r\nproduce too energetic action of any of our moving organs, those motions\r\nsoon cease, though the stimulus continues to act; as in looking long on a\r\nbright object, as on an inch-square of red silk laid on white paper in the\r\nsunshine. See Plate I. in Sect. III. 1.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, where less of the stimulus of volition, sensation, or\r\nirritation, have been applied to a muscle than usual; there appears to be\r\nan accumulation of the spirit of animation in the moving organ; by which it\r\nis liable to act with greater energy from less quantity of stimulus, than\r\nwas previously necessary to excite it into so great action; as after having\r\nbeen immersed in snow the cutaneous vessels of our hands are excited into\r\nstronger action by the stimulus of a less degree of heat, than would\r\npreviously have produced that effect.\r\n\r\nFrom hence the periods of some fever-fits may take their origin, either\r\nsimply, or by their accidental coincidence with lunar and solar periods, or\r\nwith the diurnal periods of heat and cold, to be treated of below; for\r\nduring the cold fit at the commencement of a fever, from whatever cause\r\nthat cold fit may have been induced, it follows, 1. That the spirit of\r\nanimation must become accumulated in the parts, which exert during this\r\ncold fit less than their natural quantity of action. 2. If the cause\r\nproducing the cold fit does not increase, or becomes diminished; the parts\r\nbefore benumbed or inactive become now excitable by smaller stimulus, and\r\nare thence thrown into more violent action than is natural; that is a hot\r\nfit succeeds the cold one. 3. By the energetic action of the system during\r\nthe hot fit, if it continues long, an exhaustion of the spirit of animation\r\ntakes place; and another cold fit is liable to succeed, from the moving\r\nsystem not being excitable into action from its usual stimulus. This\r\ninirritability of the system from a too great previous stimulus, and\r\nconsequent exhaustion of sensorial power, is the cause of the general\r\ndebility, and sickness, and head-ach, some hours after intoxication. And\r\nhence we see one of the causes of the periods of fever-fits; which however\r\nare frequently combined with the periods of our diurnal habits, or of heat\r\nand cold, or of solar or lunar periods.\r\n\r\nWhen besides the tendency to quiescence occasioned by the expenditure of\r\nsensorial power during the hot fit of fever, some other cause of torpor, as\r\nthe solar or lunar periods, is necessary to the introduction of a second\r\ncold fit; the fever becomes of the intermittent kind; that is, there is a\r\nspace of time intervenes between the end of the hot fit, and the\r\ncommencement of the next cold one. But where no exteriour cause is\r\nnecessary to the introduction of the second cold fit; no such interval of\r\nhealth intervenes; but the second cold fit commences, as soon as the\r\nsensorial power is sufficiently exhausted by the hot fit; and the fever\r\nbecomes continual.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The following are natural animal actions, which are frequently\r\ncatenated with our daily habits of life, as well as excited by their\r\nnatural irritations. The periods of hunger and thirst become catenated with\r\ncertain portions of time, or degrees of exhaustion, or other diurnal habits\r\nof life. And if the pain of hunger be not relieved by taking food at the\r\nusual time, it is liable to cease till the next period of time or other\r\nhabits recur; this is not only true in respect to our general desire of\r\nfood, but the kinds of it also are governed by this periodical habit;\r\ninsomuch that beer taken to breakfast will disturb the digestion of those,\r\nwho have been accustomed to tea; and tea taken at dinner will disagree with\r\nthose, who have been accustomed to beer. Whence it happens, that those, who\r\nhave weak stomachs, will be able to digest more food, if they take their\r\nmeals at regular hours; because they have both the stimulus of the aliment\r\nthey take, and the periodical habit, to assist their digestion.\r\n\r\nThe periods of emptying the bladder are not only dependent on the acrimony\r\nor distention of the water in it, but are frequently catenated with\r\nexternal cold applied to the skin, as in cold bathing, or washing the\r\nhands; or with other habits of life, as many are accustomed to empty the\r\nbladder before going to bed, or into the house after a journey, and this\r\nwhether it be full or not.\r\n\r\nOur times of respiration are not only governed by the stimulus of the blood\r\nin the lungs, or our desire of fresh air, but also by our attention to the\r\nhourly objects before us. Hence when a person is earnestly contemplating an\r\nidea of grief, he forgets to breathe, till the sensation in his lungs\r\nbecomes very urgent; and then a sigh succeeds for the purpose of more\r\nforceably pushing forwards the blood, which is accumulated in the lungs.\r\n\r\nOur times of respiration are also frequently governed in part by our want\r\nof a steady support for the actions of our arms, and hands, as in threading\r\na needle, or hewing wood, or in swimming; when we are intent upon these\r\nobjects, we breathe at the intervals of the exertion of the pectoral\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n2. The following natural animal actions are influenced by solar periods.\r\nThe periods of sleep and of waking depend much on the solar period, for we\r\nare inclined to sleep at a certain hour, and to awake at a certain hour,\r\nwhether we have had more or less fatigue during the day, if within certain\r\nlimits; and are liable to wake at a certain hour, whether we went to bed\r\nearlier or later, within certain limits. Hence it appears, that those who\r\ncomplain of want of sleep, will be liable to sleep better or longer, if\r\nthey accustom themselves to go to rest, and to rise, at certain hours.\r\n\r\nThe periods of evacuating the bowels are generally connected with some part\r\nof the solar day, as well as with the acrimony or distention occasioned by\r\nthe feces. Hence one method of correcting costiveness is by endeavouring to\r\nestablish a habit of evacuation at a certain hour of the day, as\r\nrecommended by Mr. Locke, which may be accomplished by using daily\r\nvoluntary efforts at those times, joined with the usual stimulus of the\r\nmaterial to be evacuated.\r\n\r\n3. The following natural animal actions are connected with lunar periods.\r\n1. The periods of female menstruation are connected with lunar periods to\r\ngreat exactness, in some instances even to a few hours. These do not\r\ncommence or terminate at the full or change, or at any other particular\r\npart of the lunation, but after they have commenced at any part of it, they\r\ncontinue to recur at that part with great regularity, unless disturbed by\r\nsome violent circumstance, as explained in Sect. XXXII. No. 6. their return\r\nis immediately caused by deficient venous absorption, which is owing to the\r\nwant of the stimulus, designed by nature, of amatorial copulation, or of\r\nthe growing fetus. When the catamenia returns sooner than the period of\r\nlunation, it shows a tendency of the constitution to inirritability; that\r\nis to debility, or deficiency of sensorial power, and is to be relieved by\r\nsmall doses of steel and opium.\r\n\r\nThe venereal orgasm of birds and quadrupeds seems to commence, or return\r\nabout the most powerful lunations at the vernal or autumnal equinoxes; but\r\nif it be disappointed of its object, it is said to recur at monthly\r\nperiods; in this respect resembling the female catamenia. Whence it is\r\nbelieved, that women are more liable to become pregnant at or about the\r\ntime of their catamenia, than at the intermediate times; and on this\r\naccount they are seldom much mistaken in their reckoning of nine lunar\r\nperiods from the last menstruation; the inattention to this may sometimes\r\nhave been the cause of supposed barrenness, and is therefore worth the\r\nobservation of those, who wish to have children.\r\n\r\nIII. We now come to the periods of diseased animal actions. The periods of\r\nfever-fits, which depend on the stated returns of nocturnal cold, are\r\ndiscussed in Sect. XXXII. 3. Those, which originate or recur at solar or\r\nlunar periods, are also explained in Section XXXII. 6. These we shall here\r\nenumerate; observing, however, that it is not more surprising, that the\r\ninfluence of the varying attractions of the sun and moon, should raise the\r\nocean into mountains, than that it should affect the nice sensibilities of\r\nanimal bodies; though the manner of its operation on them is difficult to\r\nbe understood. It is probable however, that as this influence gradually\r\nlessens during the course of the day, or of the lunation, or of the year,\r\nsome actions of our system become less and less; till at length a total\r\nquiescence of some part is induced; which is the commencement of the\r\nparoxysms of fever, of menstruation, of pain with decreased action of the\r\naffected organ, and of consequent convulsion.\r\n\r\n1. A diurnal fever in some weak people is distinctly observed to come on\r\ntowards evening, and to cease with a moist skin early in the morning,\r\nobeying the solar periods. Persons of weak constitutions are liable to get\r\ninto better spirits at the access of the hot fit of this evening fever; and\r\nare thence inclined to sit up late; which by further enfeebling them\r\nincreases the disease; whence they lose their strength and their colour.\r\n\r\n2. The periods of hectic fever, supposed to arise from absorption of\r\nmatter, obeys the diurnal periods like the above, having the exacerbescence\r\ntowards evening, and its remission early in the morning, with sweats, or\r\ndiarrhoea, or urine with white sediment.\r\n\r\n3. The periods of quotidian fever are either catenated with solar time, and\r\nreturn at the intervals of twenty-four hours; or with lunar time, recurring\r\nat the intervals of about twenty-five hours. There is great use in knowing\r\nwith what circumstances the periodical return or new morbid motions are\r\nconjoined, as the most effectual times of exhibiting the proper medicines\r\nare thus determined. So if the torpor, which ushers in an ague fit, is\r\ncatenated with the lunar day: it is known, when the bark or opium must be\r\ngiven, so as to exert its principal effect about the time of the expected\r\nreturn. Solid opium should be given about an hour before the expected cold\r\nfit; liquid opium and wine about half an hour; the bark repeatedly for six\r\nor eight hours previous to the expected return.\r\n\r\n4. The periods of tertian fevers, reckoned from the commencement of one\r\ncold fit to the commencement of the next cold fit, recur with solar\r\nintervals of forty-eight hours, or with lunar ones of about fifty hours.\r\nWhen these of recurrence begin one or two hours earlier than the solar\r\nperiod, it shews, that the torpor or cold fit is produced by less external\r\ninfluence; and therefore that it is more liable to degenerate into a fever\r\nwith only remissions; so when menstruation recurs sooner than the period of\r\nlunation, it shews a tendency of the habit to torpor of inirritability.\r\n\r\n5. The periods of quartan fevers return at solar intervals of seventy-two\r\nhours, or at lunar ones of about seventy-four hours and an half. This kind\r\nof ague appears most in moist cold autumns, and in cold countries replete\r\nwith marshes. It is attended with greater debility, and its cold access\r\nmore difficult to prevent. For where there is previously a deficiency of\r\nsensorial power, the constitution is liable to run into greater torpor from\r\nany further diminution of it; two ounces of bark and some steel should be\r\ngiven on the day before the return of the cold paroxysm, and a pint of wine\r\nby degrees a few hours before its return, and thirty drops of laudanum one\r\nhour before the expected cold fit.\r\n\r\n6. The periods of the gout generally commence about an hour before\r\nsun-rise, which is usually the coldest part of the twenty-four hours. The\r\ngreater periods of the gout seem also to observe the solar influence,\r\nreturning about the same season of the year.\r\n\r\n7. The periods of the pleurisy recur with exacerbation of the pain and\r\nfever about sun-set, at which time venesection is of most service. The same\r\nmay be observed of the inflammatory rheumatism, and other fevers with\r\narterial strength, which seem to obey solar periods; and those with\r\ndebility seem to obey lunar ones.\r\n\r\n8. The periods of fevers with arterial debility seem to obey the lunar day,\r\nhaving their access daily nearly an hour later; and have sometimes two\r\naccesses in a day, resembling the lunar effects upon the tides.\r\n\r\n9. The periods of rhaphania, or convulsions of the limbs from rheumatic\r\npains, seem to be connected with solar influence, returning at nearly the\r\nsame hour for weeks together, unless disturbed by the exhibition of\r\npowerful doses of opium.\r\n\r\nSo the periods of Tussis ferina, or violent cough with slow pulse, called\r\nnervous cough, recurs by solar periods. Five grains of opium, given at the\r\ntime the cough commenced disturbed the period, from seven in the evening to\r\neleven, at which time it regularly returned for some days, during which\r\ntime the opium was gradually omitted. Then 120 drops of laudanum were given\r\nan hour before the access of the cough, and it totally ceased. The laudanum\r\nwas continued a fortnight, and then gradually discontinued.\r\n\r\n10. The periods of hemicrania, and of painful epilepsy, are liable to obey\r\nlunar periods, both in their diurnal returns, and in their greater periods\r\nof weeks, but are also induced by other exciting causes.\r\n\r\n11. The periods of arterial hæmorrhages seem to return at solar periods\r\nabout the same hour of the evening or morning. Perhaps the venous\r\nhæmorrhages obey the lunar periods, as the catamenia, and hæmorrhoids.\r\n\r\n12. The periods of the hæmorrhoids, or piles, in some recur monthly, in\r\nothers only at the greater lunar influence about the equinoxes.\r\n\r\n13. The periods of hæmoptoe sometimes obey solar influence, recurring early\r\nin the morning for several days; and sometimes lunar periods, recurring\r\nmonthly; and sometimes depend on our hours of sleep. See Class I. 2. 1. 9.\r\n\r\n14. Many of the first periods of epileptic fits obey the monthly lunation\r\nwith some degree of accuracy; others recur only at the most powerful\r\nlunations before the vernal equinox, and after the autumnal one; but when\r\nthe constitution has gained a habit of relieving disagreeable sensations by\r\nthis kind of exertion, the fit recurs from any slight cause.\r\n\r\n15. The attack of palsy and apoplexy are known to recur with great\r\nfrequency about the equinoxes.\r\n\r\n16. There are numerous instances of the effect of the lunations upon the\r\nperiods of insanity, whence the name of lunatic has been given to those\r\nafflicted with this disease.\r\n\r\nIV. The critical days, in which fevers are supposed to terminate, have\r\nemployed the attention of medical philosophers from the days of Hippocrates\r\nto the present time. In whatever part of a lunation a fever commences,\r\nwhich owes either its whole cause to solar and lunar influence, or to this\r\nin conjunction with other causes; it would seem, that the effect would be\r\nthe greatest at the full and new moon, as the tides rise highest at those\r\ntimes, and would be the least at the quadratures; thus if a fever-fit\r\nshould commence at the new or full moon, occasioned by the solar and lunar\r\nattraction diminishing some chemical affinity of the particles of blood,\r\nand thence decreasing their stimulus on our sanguiferous system, as\r\nmentioned in Sect. XXXII. 6. this effect will daily decrease for the first\r\nseven days, and will then increase till about the fourteenth day, and will\r\nagain decrease till about the twenty-first day, and increase again till the\r\nend of the lunation. If a fever-fit from the above cause should commence on\r\nthe seventh day after either lunation, the reverse of the above\r\ncircumstances would happen. Now it is probable, that those fevers, whose\r\ncrisis or terminations are influenced by lunations, may begin at one or\r\nother of the above times, namely at the changes or quadratures; though\r\nsufficient observations have not been made to ascertain this circumstance.\r\nHence I conclude, that the small-pox and measles have their critical days,\r\nnot governed by the times required for certain chemical changes in the\r\nblood, which affect or alter the stimulus of the contagious matter, but\r\nfrom the daily increasing or decreasing effect of this lunar link of\r\ncatenation, as explained in Section XVII. 3. 3. And as other fevers\r\nterminate most frequently about the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, or\r\nabout the end of four weeks, when no medical assistance has disturbed their\r\nperiods, I conclude, that these crises, or terminations, are governed by\r\nperiods of the lunations; though we are still ignorant of their manner of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nIn the distinct small-pox the vestiges of lunation are very apparent, after\r\ninoculation a quarter of a lunation precedes the commencement of the fever,\r\nanother quarter terminates with the complete eruption, another quarter with\r\nthe complete maturation, and another quarter terminates the complete\r\nabsorption of a material now rendered inoffensive to the constitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT. XXXVII.\r\n\r\nOF DIGESTION, SECRETION, NUTRITION.\r\n\r\n    I. _Crystals increase by the greater attraction of their sides.\r\n    Accretion by chemical precipitations, by welding, by pressure, by\r\n    agglutination._ II. _Hunger, digestion, why it cannot be imitated out\r\n    of the body. Lacteals absorb by animal selection or appetency._ III.\r\n    _The glands and pores absorb nutritious particles by animal selection.\r\n    Organic particles of Buffon. Nutrition applied at the time of\r\n    elongation of fibres. Like inflammation._ IV. _It seems easier to have\r\n    preserved animals than to reproduce them. Old age and death from\r\n    inirritability. Three causes of this. Original fibres of the organs of\r\n    sense and muscles unchanged._ V. _Art of producing long life._\r\n\r\nI. The larger crystals of saline bodies may be conceived to arise from the\r\ncombination of smaller crystals of the same form, owing to the greater\r\nattractions of their sides than of their angles. Thus if four cubes were\r\nfloating in a fluid, whose friction or resistance is nothing, it is certain\r\nthe sides of these cubes would attract each other stronger than their\r\nangles; and hence that these four smaller cubes would so arrange themselves\r\nas to produce one larger one.\r\n\r\nThere are other means of chemical accretion, such as the depositions of\r\ndissolved calcareous or siliceous particles, as are seen in the formation\r\nof the stalactites of limestone in Derbyshire, or of calcedone in Cornwall.\r\nOther means of adhesion are produced by heat and pressure, as in the\r\nwelding of iron-bars; and other means by simple pressure, as in forcing two\r\npieces of caoutchou, or elastic gum, to adhere; and lastly, by the\r\nagglutination of a third substance penetrating the pores of the other two,\r\nas in the agglutination of wood by means of animal gluten. Though the\r\nultimate particles of animal bodies are held together during life, as well\r\nas after death, by their specific attraction of cohesion, like all other\r\nmatter; yet it does not appear, that their original organization was\r\nproduced by chemical laws, and their production and increase must therefore\r\nonly be looked for from the laws of animation.\r\n\r\nII. When the pain of hunger requires relief, certain parts of the material\r\nworld, which surround us, when applied to our palates, excite into action\r\nthe muscles of deglutition; and the material is swallowed into the stomach.\r\nHere the new aliment becomes mixed with certain animal fluids, and\r\nundergoes a chemical process, termed digestion; which however chemistry has\r\nnot yet learnt to imitate out of the bodies of living animals or\r\nvegetables. This process seems very similar to the saccharine process in\r\nthe lobes of farinaceous seeds, as of barley, when it begins to germinate;\r\nexcept that, along with the sugar, oil and mucilage are also produced;\r\nwhich form the chyle of animals, which is very similar to their milk.\r\n\r\nThe reason, I imagine, why this chyle-making, or saccharine process, has\r\nnot yet been imitated by chemical operations, is owing to the materials\r\nbeing in such a situation in respect to warmth, moisture, and motion; that\r\nthey will immediately change into the vinous or acetous fermentation;\r\nexcept the new sugar be absorbed by the numerous lacteal or lymphatic\r\nvessels, as soon as it is produced; which is not easy to imitate in the\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nThese lacteal vessels have mouths, which are irritated into action by the\r\nstimulus of the fluid, which surrounds them; and by animal selection, or\r\nappetency, they absorb such part of the fluid as is agreeable to their\r\npalate; those parts, for instance, which are already converted into chyle,\r\nbefore they have time to undergo another change by a vinous or acetous\r\nfermentation. This animal absorption of fluid is almost visible to the\r\nnaked eye in the action of the puncta lacrymalia; which imbibe the tears\r\nfrom the eye, and discharge them again into the nostrils.\r\n\r\nIII. The arteries constitute another reservoir of a changeful fluid; from\r\nwhich, after its recent oxygenation in the lungs, a further animal\r\nselection of various fluids is absorbed by the numerous glands; these\r\nselect their respective fluids from the blood, which is perpetually\r\nundergoing a chemical change; but the selection by these glands, like that\r\nof the lacteals, which open their mouths into the digesting aliment in the\r\nstomach, is from animal appetency, not from chemical affinity; secretion\r\ncannot therefore be imitated in the laboratory, as it consists in a\r\nselection of part of a fluid during the chemical change of that fluid.\r\n\r\nThe mouths of the lacteals, and lymphatics, and the ultimate terminations\r\nof the glands, are finer than can easily be conceived; yet it is probable,\r\nthat the pores, or interstices of the parts, or coats, which constitute\r\nthese ultimate vessels, may still have greater tenuity; and that these\r\npores from the above analogy must posses a similar power of irritability,\r\nand absorb by their living energy the particles of fluid adapted to their\r\npurposes, whether to replace the parts abraded or dissolved, or to elongate\r\nand enlarge themselves. Not only every kind of gland is thus endued with\r\nits peculiar appetency, and selects the material agreeable to its taste\r\nfrom the blood, but every individual pore acquires by animal selection the\r\nmaterial, which it wants; and thus nutrition seems to be performed in a\r\nmanner so similar to secretion; that they only differ in the one retaining,\r\nand the other parting again with the particles, which they have selected\r\nfrom the blood.\r\n\r\nThis way of accounting for nutrition from stimulus, and the consequent\r\nanimal selection of particles, is much more analogous to other phenomena of\r\nthe animal microcosm, than by having recourse to the microscopic\r\nanimalcula, or organic particles of Buffon, and Needham; which being\r\nalready compounded must themselves require nutritive particles to continue\r\ntheir own existence. And must be liable to undergo a change by our\r\ndigestive or secretory organs; otherwise mankind would soon resemble by\r\ntheir theory the animals, which they feed upon. He, who is nourished by\r\nbeef or venison, would in time become horned; and he, who feeds on pork or\r\nbacon, would gain a nose proper for rooting into the earth, as well as for\r\nthe perception of odours.\r\n\r\nThe whole animal system may be considered as consisting of the extremities\r\nof the nerves, or of having been produced from them; if we except perhaps\r\nthe medullary part of the brain residing in the head and spine, and in the\r\ntrunks of the nerves. These extremities of the nerves are either of those\r\nof locomotion, which are termed muscular fibres; or of those of sensation,\r\nwhich constitute the immediate organs of sense, and which have also their\r\npeculiar motions. Now as the fibres, which constitute the bones and\r\nmembranes, possessed originally sensation and motion; and are liable again\r\nto possess them, when they become inflamed; it follows, that those were,\r\nwhen first formed, appendages to the nerves of sensation or locomotion, or\r\nwere formed from them. And that hence all these solid parts of the body, as\r\nthey have originally consisted of extremities of nerves, require an\r\napposition of nutritive particles of a similar kind, contrary to the\r\nopinion of Buffon and Needham above recited.\r\n\r\nLastly, as all these filaments have possessed, or do possess, the power of\r\ncontraction, and of consequent inertion or elongation; it seems probable,\r\nthat the nutritive particles are applied during their times of elongation;\r\nwhen their original constituent particles are removed to a greater distance\r\nfrom each other. For each muscular or sensual fibre may be considered as a\r\nrow or string of beads; which approach, when in contraction, and recede\r\nduring its rest or elongation; and our daily experience shews us, that\r\ngreat action emaciates the system, and that it is repaired during rest.\r\n\r\nSomething like this is seen out of the body; for if a hair, or a single\r\nuntwisted fibre of flax or silk, be soaked in water; it becomes longer and\r\nthicker by the water, which is absorbed into its pores. Now if a hair could\r\nbe supposed to be thus immersed in a solution of particles similar to\r\nthose, which compose it; one may imagine, that it might be thus increased\r\nin weight and magnitude; as the particles of oak-bark increase the\r\nsubstance of the hides of beasts in the process of making leather. I\r\nmention these not as philosophic analogies, but as similes to facilitate\r\nour ideas, how an accretion of parts may be effected by animal appetences,\r\nor selections, in a manner somewhat similar to mechanical or chemical\r\nattractions.\r\n\r\nIf those new particles of matter, previously prepared by digestion and\r\nsanguification, only supply the places of those, which have been abraded by\r\nthe actions of the system, it is properly termed nutrition. If they are\r\napplied to the extremities of the nervous fibrils, or in such quantity as\r\nto increase the length or crassitude of them, the body becomes at the same\r\ntime enlarged, and its growth is increased, as well as its deficiences\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nIn this last case something more than a simple apposition or selection of\r\nparticles seems to be necessary; as many parts of the system during its\r\ngrowth are caused to recede from those, with which they were before in\r\ncontact; as the ends of the bones, or cartilages, recede from each other,\r\nas their growth advances: this process resembles inflammation, as appears\r\nin ophthalmy, or in the production of new flesh in ulcers, where old\r\nvessels are enlarged, and new ones produced; and like that is attended with\r\nsensation. In this situation the vessels become distended with blood, and\r\nacquire greater sensibility, and may thus be compared to the erection of\r\nthe penis, or of the nipples of the breasts of women; while new particles\r\nbecome added at the same time; as in the process of nutrition above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWhen only the natural growth of the various parts of the body are produced,\r\na pleasurable sensation attends it, as in youth, and perhaps in those, who\r\nare in the progress of becoming fat. When an unnatural growth is the\r\nconsequence, as in inflammatory diseases, a painful sensation attends the\r\nenlargement of the system.\r\n\r\nIV. This apposition of new parts, as the old ones disappear, selected from\r\nthe aliment we take, first enlarges and strengthens our bodies for twenty\r\nyears, for another twenty years it keeps us in health and vigour, and adds\r\nstrength and solidity to the system; and then gradually ceases to nourish\r\nus properly, and for another twenty years we gradually sink into decay, and\r\nfinally cease to act, and to exist.\r\n\r\nOn considering this subject one should have imagined at first view, that it\r\nmight have been easier for nature to have supported her progeny for ever in\r\nhealth and life, than to have perpetually reproduced them by the wonderful\r\nand mysterious process of generation. But it seems our bodies by long habit\r\ncease to obey the stimulus of the aliment, which should support us. After\r\nwe have acquired our height and solidity we make no more new parts, and the\r\nsystem obeys the irritations, sensations, volitions; and associations,\r\nwith, less and less energy, till the whole sinks into inaction.\r\n\r\nThree causes may conspire to render our nerves less excitable, which have\r\nbeen already mentioned, 1. If a stimulus be greater than natural, it\r\nproduces too great an exertion of the stimulated organ, and in consequence\r\nexhausts the spirit of animation; and the moving organ ceases to act, even\r\nthough the stimulus be continued. And though rest will recruit this\r\nexhaustion, yet some degree of permanent injury remains, as is evident\r\nafter exposing the eyes long to too strong a light. 2. If excitations\r\nweaker than natural be applied, so as not to excite the organ into action,\r\n(as when small doses of aloe or rhubarb are exhibited,) they may be\r\ngradually increased, without exciting the organ into action; which will\r\nthus acquire a habit of disobedience to the stimulus; thus by increasing\r\nthe dose by degrees, great quantities of opium or wine may be taken without\r\nintoxication. See Sect. XII. 3. 1.\r\n\r\n3. Another mode, by which life is gradually undermined, is when irritative\r\nmotions continue to be produced in consequence of stimulus, but are not\r\nsucceeded by sensation; hence the stimulus of contagious matter is not\r\ncapable of producing fever a second time, because it is not succeeded by\r\nsensation. See Sect. XII. 3. 6. And hence, owing to the want of the general\r\npleasurable sensation, which ought to attend digestion and glandular\r\nsecretion, an irksomeness of life ensues; and, where this is in greater\r\nexcess, the melancholy of old age occurs, with torpor or debility.\r\n\r\nFrom hence I conclude, that it is probable that the fibrillæ, or moving\r\nfilaments at the extremities of the nerves of sense, and the fibres which\r\nconstitute the muscles (which are perhaps the only parts of the system that\r\nare endued with contractile life) are not changed, as we advance in years,\r\nlike the other parts of the body; but only enlarged or elongated with our\r\ngrowth; and in consequence they become less and less excitable into action.\r\nWhence, instead of gradually changing the old animal, the generation of a\r\ntotally new one becomes necessary with undiminished excitability; which\r\nmany years will continue to acquire new parts, or new solidity, and then\r\nlosing its excitability in time, perish like its parent.\r\n\r\nV. From this idea the art of preserving long health and life may be\r\ndeduced; which must consist in using no greater stimulus, whether of the\r\nquantity or kind of our food and drink, or of external circumstances, such\r\nas heat, and exercise, and wakefulness, than is sufficient to preserve us\r\nin vigour; and gradually, as we grow old to increase the stimulus of our\r\naliment, as the irritability of our system increases.\r\n\r\nThe debilitating effects ascribed by the poet MARTIAL to the excessive use\r\nof warm bathing in Italy, may with equal propriety be applied to the warm\r\nrooms of England; which, with the general excessive stimulus of spirituous\r\nor fermented liquors, and in some instances of immoderate venery,\r\ncontribute to shorten our lives.\r\n\r\n  _Balnea, vina, venus, corrumpunt corpora nostra_,\r\n  _At faciunt vitam balnea, vina, venus!_\r\n\r\n  Wine, women, warmth, against our lives combine;\r\n  But what is life without warmth, women, wine!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

It is found in the esophagus\r\n    and stomach, and forms the meconium. Monstrous births without heads.\r\n    Question of Dr. Harvey._\r\n\r\nI. From the recent discoveries of many ingenious philosophers it appears,\r\nthat during respiration the blood imbibes the vital part of the air, called\r\noxygene, through the membranes of the lungs; and that hence respiration may\r\nbe aptly compared to a slow combustion. As in combustion the oxygene of the\r\natmosphere unites with some phlogistic or inflammable body, and forms an\r\nacid (as in the production of vitriolic acid from sulphur, or carbonic acid\r\nfrom charcoal,) giving out at the same time a quantity of the matter of\r\nheat; so in respiration the oxygene of the air unites with the phlogistic\r\npart of the blood, and probably produces phosphoric or animal acid,\r\nchanging the colour of the blood from a dark to a bright red; and probably\r\nsome of the matter of heat is at the same time given out according to the\r\ntheory of Dr. Crawford. But as the evolution of heat attends almost all\r\nchemical combinations, it is probable, that it also attends the secretions\r\nof the various fluids from the blood; and that the constant combinations or\r\nproductions of new fluids by means of the glands constitute the more\r\ngeneral source of animal heat; this seems evinced by the universal\r\nevolution of the matter of heat in the blush of shame or of anger; in which\r\nat the same time an increased secretion of the perspirable matter occurs;\r\nand the partial evolution of it from topical inflammations, as in gout or\r\nrheumatism, in which there is a secretion of new blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nSome medical philosophers have ascribed the heat of animal bodies to the\r\nfriction of the particles of the blood against the sides of the vessels.\r\nBut no perceptible heat has ever been produced by the agitation of water,\r\nor oil, or quicksilver, or other fluids; except those fluids have undergone\r\nat the same time some chemical change, as in agitating milk or wine, till\r\nthey become sour.\r\n\r\nBesides the supposed production of phosphoric acid, and change of colour of\r\nthe blood, and the production of carbonic acid, there would appear to be\r\nsomething of a more subtile nature perpetually acquired from the\r\natmosphere; which is too fine to be long contained in animal vessels, and\r\ntherefore requires perpetual renovation; and without which life cannot\r\ncontinue longer than a minute or two; this ethereal fluid is probably\r\nsecreted from the blood by the brain, and perpetually dissipated in the\r\nactions of the muscles and organs of sense.\r\n\r\nThat the blood acquires something from the air, which is immediately\r\nnecessary to life, appears from an experiment of Dr. Hare (Philos.\r\nTransact. abridged, Vol. III. p. 239.) who found, \"that birds, mice, &c.\r\nwould live as long again in a vessel, where he had crowded in double the\r\nquantity of air by a condensing engine, than they did when confined in air\r\nof the common density.\" Whereas if some kind of deleterious vapour only was\r\nexhaled from the blood in respiration; the air, when condensed into half\r\nits compass, could not be supposed to receive so much of it.\r\n\r\nII. Sir Edward Hulse, a physician of reputation at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, was of opinion, that the placenta was a respiratory organ,\r\nlike the gills of fish; and not an organ to supply nutriment to the foetus;\r\nas mentioned in Derham's Physico-theology. Many other physicians seem to\r\nhave espoused the same opinion, as noticed by Haller. Elem. Physiologiæ, T.\r\n1. Dr. Gipson published a defence of this theory in the Medical Essays of\r\nEdinburgh, Vol. I. and II. which doctrine is there controverted at large by\r\nthe late Alexander Monro; and since that time the general opinion has been,\r\nthat the placenta is an organ of nutrition only, owing perhaps rather to\r\nthe authority of so great a name, than to the validity of the arguments\r\nadduced in its support. The subject has lately been resumed by Dr. James\r\nJeffray, and by Dr. Forester French, in their inaugural dissertations at\r\nEdinburgh and at Cambridge; who have defended the contrary opinion in an\r\nable and ingenious manner; and from whose Theses I have extracted many of\r\nthe following remarks.\r\n\r\nFirst, by the late discoveries of Dr. Priestley, M. Lavoisier, and other\r\nphilosophers, it appears, that the basis of atmospherical air, called\r\noxygene, is received by the blood through the membranes of the lungs; and\r\nthat by this addition the colour of the blood is changed from a dark to a\r\nlight red. Secondly, that water possesses oxygene also as a part of its\r\ncomposition, and contains air likewise in its pores; whence the blood of\r\nfish receives oxygene from the water, or from the air it contains, by means\r\nof their gills, in the same manner as the blood is oxygenated in the lungs\r\nof air-breathing animals; it changes its colour at the same time from a\r\ndark to a light red in the vessels of their gills, which constitute a\r\npulmonary organ adapted to the medium in which they live. Thirdly, that the\r\nplacenta consists of arteries carrying the blood to its extremities, and a\r\nvein bringing it back, resembling exactly in structure the lungs and gills\r\nabove mentioned; and that the blood changes its colour from a dark to a\r\nlight red in passing through these vessels.\r\n\r\nThis analogy between the lungs and gills of animals, and the placenta of\r\nthe fetus, extends through a great variety of other circumstances; thus\r\nair-breathing creatures and fish can live but a few minutes without air or\r\nwater; or when they are confined in such air or water, as has been spoiled\r\nby their own respiration; the same happens to the fetus, which, as soon as\r\nthe placenta is separated from the uterus, must either expand its lungs,\r\nand receive air, or die. Hence from the structure, as well as the use of\r\nthe placenta, it appears to be a respiratory organ, like the gills of fish,\r\nby which the blood in the fetus becomes oxygenated.\r\n\r\nFrom the terminations of the placental vessels not being observed to bleed\r\nafter being torn from the uterus, while those of the uterus effuse a great\r\nquantity of florid arterial blood, the terminations of the placental\r\nvessels would seem to be inserted into the arterial ones of the mother; and\r\nto receive oxygenation from the passing currents of her blood through their\r\ncoats or membranes; which oxygenation is proved by the change of the colour\r\nof the blood from dark to light red in its passage from the placental\r\narteries to the placental vein.\r\n\r\nThe curious structure of the cavities or lacunæ of the placenta,\r\ndemonstrated by Mr. J. Hunter, explain this circumstance. That ingenious\r\nphilosopher has shewn, that there are numerous cavities of lacunæ formed on\r\nthat side of the placenta, which is in contact with the uterus; those\r\ncavities or cells are filled with blood from the maternal arteries, which\r\nopen into them; which blood is again taken up by the maternal veins, and is\r\nthus perpetually changed. While the terminations of the placental arteries\r\nand veins are spread in fine reticulation on the sides of these cells. And\r\nthus, as the growing fetus requires greater oxygenation, an apparatus is\r\nproduced resembling exactly the air-cells of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn cows, and other ruminating animals, the internal surface of the uterus\r\nis unequal like hollow cups, which have been called cotyledons; and into\r\nthese cavities the prominencies of the numerous placentas, with which the\r\nfetus of those animals is furnished, are inserted, and strictly adhere;\r\nthough they may be extracted without effusion of blood. These inequalities\r\nof the uterus, and the numerous placentas in consequence, seem to be\r\ndesigned for the purpose of expanding a greater surface for the\r\nterminations of the placental vessels for the purpose of receiving\r\noxygenation from the uterine ones; as the progeny of this class of animals\r\nare more completely formed before their nativity, than that of the\r\ncarnivorous classes, and must thence in the latter weeks of pregnancy\r\nrequire greater oxygenation. Thus calves and lambs can walk about in a few\r\nminutes after their birth; while puppies and kittens remain many days\r\nwithout opening their eyes. And though on the separation of the cotyledons\r\nof ruminating animals no blood is effused, yet this is owing clearly to the\r\ngreater power of contraction of their uterine lacunæ or alveoli. See\r\nMedical Essays, Vol. V. page 144. And from the same cause they are not\r\nliable to a sanguiferous menstruation.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of the oxygenation of the blood in the fetus is farther\r\nillustrated by the analogy of the chick in the egg; which appears to have\r\nits blood oxygenated at the extremities of the vessels surrounding the\r\nyolk; which are spread on the air-bag at the broad end of the egg, and may\r\nabsorb oxygene through that moist membrane from the air confined behind it;\r\nand which is shewn by experiments in the exhausted receiver to be\r\nchangeable though the shell.\r\n\r\nThis analogy may even be extended to the growing seeds of vegetables; which\r\nwere shewn by Mr. Scheele to require a renovation of the air over the\r\nwater, in which they were confined. Many vegetable seeds are surrounded\r\nwith air in their pods or receptacles, as peas, the fruit of staphylea, and\r\nlichnis vesicaria; but it is probable, that those seeds, after they are\r\nshed, as well as the spawn of fish, by the situation of the former on or\r\nnear the moist and aerated surface of the earth, and of the latter in the\r\never-changing and ventilated water, may not be in need of an apparatus for\r\nthe oxygenation of their first blood, before the leaves of one, and the\r\ngills of the other, are produced for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. There are many arguments, besides the strict analogy between the\r\nliquor amnii and the albumen ovi, which shew the former to be a nutritive\r\nfluid; and that the fetus in the latter months of pregnancy takes it into\r\nits stomach; and that in consequence the placenta is produced for some\r\nother important purpose.\r\n\r\nFirst, that the liquor amnii is not an excrementitious fluid is evinced,\r\nbecause it is found in greater quantity, when the fetus is young,\r\ndecreasing after a certain period till birth. Haller asserts, \"that in some\r\nanimals but a small quantity of this fluid remains at the birth. In the\r\neggs of hens it is consumed on the eighteenth day, so that at the exclusion\r\nof the chick scarcely any remains. In rabbits before birth there is none.\"\r\nElem. Physiol. Had this been an excrementitious fluid, the contrary would\r\nprobably have occurred. Secondly, the skin of the fetus is covered with a\r\nwhitish crust or pellicle, which would seem to preclude any idea of the\r\nliquor amnii being produced by any exsudation of perspirable matter. And it\r\ncannot consist of urine, because in brute animals the urachus passes from\r\nthe bladder to the alantois for the express purpose of carrying off that\r\nfluid; which however in the human fetus seems to be retained in the\r\ndistended bladder, as the feces are accumulated in the bowels of all\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n2. The nutritious quality of the liquid, which surrounds the fetus, appears\r\nfrom the following considerations. 1. It is coagulable by heat, by nitrous\r\nacid, and by spirit of wine, like milk, serum of blood, and other fluids,\r\nwhich daily experience evinces to be nutritious. 2. It has a saltish taste\r\naccording to the accurate Baron Haller, not unlike the whey of milk, which\r\nit even resembles in smell. 3. The white of the egg which constitutes the\r\nfood of the chick, is shewn to be nutritious by our daily experience;\r\nbesides the experiment of its nutritious effects mentioned by Dr. Fordyce\r\nin his late Treatise on Digestion, p. 178; who adds, that it much resembles\r\nthe essential parts of the serum of blood.\r\n\r\n3. A fluid similar to the fluid, with which the fetus is surrounded, except\r\nwhat little change may be produced by a beginning digestion, is found in\r\nthe stomach of the fetus; and the white of the egg is found, in the same\r\nmanner in the stomach of the chick.\r\n\r\nNumerous hairs, similar to those of its skin, are perpetually found among\r\nthe contents of the stomach in new-born calves; which must therefore have\r\nlicked themselves before their nativity. Blasii Anatom. See Sect. XVI. 2.\r\non Instinct.\r\n\r\nThe chick in the egg is seen gently to move in its surrounding fluid, and\r\nto open and shut its mouth alternately. The same has been observed in\r\npuppies. Haller's El. Phys. I. 8. p. 201.\r\n\r\nA column of ice has been seen to reach down the oesophagus from the mouth\r\nto the stomach in a frozen fetus; and this ice was the liquor amnii frozen.\r\n\r\nThe meconium, or first fæces, in the bowels of new-born infants evince,\r\nthat something has been digested; and what could this be but the liquor\r\namnii together with the recrements of the gastric juice and gall, which\r\nwere necessary for its digestion?\r\n\r\nThere have been recorded some monstrous births of animals without heads,\r\nand consequently without mouths, which seem to have been delivered on\r\ndoubtful authority, or from inaccurate observation. There are two of such\r\nmonstrous productions however better attested; one of a human fetus,\r\nmentioned by Gipson in the Scots Medical Essays; which having the gula\r\nimpervious was furnished with an aperture into the wind-pipe, which\r\ncommunicated below into the gullet; by means of which the liquor amnii\r\nmight be taken into the stomach before nativity without danger of\r\nsuffocation, while the fetus had no occasion to breathe. The other\r\nmonstrous fetus is described by Vander Wiel, who asserts, that he saw a\r\nmonstrous lamb, which had no mouth; but instead of it was furnished with an\r\nopening in the lower part of the neck into the stomach. Both these\r\ninstances evidently favour the doctrine of the fetus being nourished by the\r\nmouth; as otherwise there had been no necessity for new or unnatural\r\napertures into the stomach, when the natural ones were deficient?\r\n\r\nFrom these facts and observations we may safely infer, that the fetus in\r\nthe womb is nourished by the fluid which surrounds it; which during the\r\nfirst period of gestation is absorbed by the naked lacteals; and is\r\nafterwards swallowed into the stomach and bowels, when these organs are\r\nperfected; and lastly that the placenta is an organ for the purpose of\r\ngiving due oxygenation to the blood of the fetus; which is more necessary,\r\nor at least more frequently necessary, than even the supply of food.\r\n\r\nThe question of the great Harvey becomes thus easily answered. \"Why is not\r\nthe fetus in the womb suffocated for want of air, when it remains there\r\neven to the tenth month without respiration: yet if it be born in the\r\nseventh or eighth month, and has once respired, it becomes immediately\r\nsuffocated for want of air, if its respiration be obstructed?\"\r\n\r\nFor further information on this subject, the reader is referred to the\r\nTentamen Medicum of Dr. Jeffray, printed at Edinburgh in 1786. And it is\r\nhoped that Dr. French will some time give his theses on this subject to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSECT.

The ingenious Dr. Hartley in his work on man, and some other\r\nphilosophers, have been of opinion, that our immortal part acquires during\r\nthis life certain habits of action or of sentiment, which become for ever\r\nindissoluble, continuing after death in a future state of existence; and\r\nadd, that if these habits are of the malevolent kind, they must render the\r\npossessor miserable even in heaven. I would apply this ingenious idea to\r\nthe generation or production of the embryon, or new animal, which partakes\r\nso much of the form and propensities of the parent.\r\n\r\nOwing to the imperfection of language the offspring is termed a _new_\r\nanimal, but is in truth a branch or elongation of the parent; since a part\r\nof the embryon-animal is, or was, a part of the parent; and therefore in\r\nstrict language it cannot be said to be entirely _new_ at the time of its\r\nproduction; and therefore it may retain some of the habits of the\r\nparent-system.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest period of its existence the embryon, as secreted from the\r\nblood of the male, would seem to consist of a living filament with certain\r\ncapabilities of irritation, sensation, volition, and association; and also\r\nwith some acquired habits or propensities peculiar to the parent: the\r\nformer of these are in common with other animals; the latter seem to\r\ndistinguish or produce the kind of animal, whether man or quadruped, with\r\nthe similarity of feature or form to the parent. It is difficult to be\r\nconceived, that a living entity can be separated or produced from the blood\r\nby the action of a gland; and which shall afterwards become an animal\r\nsimilar to that in whose vessels it is formed; even though we should\r\nsuppose with some modern theorists, that the blood is alive; yet every\r\nother hypothesis concerning generation rests on principles still more\r\ndifficult to our comprehension.\r\n\r\nAt the time of procreation this speck of entity is received into an\r\nappropriated nidus, in which it must acquire two circumstances necessary to\r\nits life and growth; one of these is food or sustenance, which is to be\r\nreceived by the absorbent mouths of its vessels; and the other is that part\r\nof atmospherical air, or of water, which by the new chemistry is termed\r\noxygene, and which affects the blood by passing through the coats of the\r\nvessels which contain it. The fluid surrounding the embryon in its new\r\nhabitation, which is called liquor amnii, supplies it with nourishment; and\r\nas some air cannot but be introduced into the uterus along with a new\r\nembryon, it would seem that this same fluid would for a short time, suppose\r\nfor a few hours, supply likewise a sufficient quantity of the oxygene for\r\nits immediate existence.\r\n\r\nOn this account the vegetable impregnation of aquatic plants is performed\r\nin the air; and it is probable that the honey-cup or nectary of vegetables\r\nrequires to be open to the air, that the anthers and stigmas of the flower\r\nmay have food of a more oxygenated kind than the common vegetable\r\nsap-juice.\r\n\r\nOn the introduction of this primordium of entity into the uterus the\r\nirritation of the liquor amnii, which surrounds it, excites the absorbent\r\nmouths of the new vessels into action; they drink up a part of it, and a\r\npleasurable sensation accompanies this new action; at the same time the\r\nchemical affinity of the oxygene acts through the vessels of the rubescent\r\nblood; and a previous want, or disagreeable sensation, is relieved by this\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAs the want of this oxygenation of the blood is perpetual, (as appears from\r\nthe incessant necessity of breathing by lungs or gills,) the vessels become\r\nextended by the efforts of pain or desire to seek this necessary object of\r\noxygenation, and to remove the disagreeable sensation, which that want\r\noccasions. At the same time new particles of matter are absorbed, or\r\napplied to these extended vessels, and they become permanently elongated,\r\nas the fluid in contact with them soon loses the oxygenous part, which it\r\nat first possessed, which was owing to the introduction of air along with\r\nthe embryon. These new blood-vessels approach the sides of the uterus, and\r\npenetrate with their fine terminations into the vessels of the mother; or\r\nadhere to them, acquiring oxygene through their coats from the passing\r\ncurrents of the arterial blood of the mother. See Sect. XXXVIII. 2.\r\n\r\nThis attachment of the placental vessels to the internal side of the uterus\r\nby their own proper efforts appears further illustrated by the many\r\ninstances of extra-uterine fetuses, which have thus attached or inserted\r\ntheir vessels into the peritoneum; or on the viscera, exactly in the same\r\nmanner as they naturally insert or attach them to the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe absorbent vessels of the embryon continue to drink up nourishment from\r\nthe fluid in which they swim, or liquor amnii; and which at first needs no\r\nprevious digestive preparation; but which, when the whole apparatus of\r\ndigestion becomes complete, is swallowed by the mouth into the stomach, and\r\nbeing mixed with saliva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and mucus\r\nof the intestines, becomes digested, and leaves a recrement, which produces\r\nthe first feces of the infant, called meconium.\r\n\r\nThe liquor amnii is secreted into the uterus, as the fetus requires it, and\r\nmay probably be produced by the irritation of the fetus as an extraneous\r\nbody; since a similar fluid is acquired from the peritoneum in cases of\r\nextra-uterine gestation. The young caterpillars of the gadfly placed in the\r\nskins of cows, and the young of the ichneumon-fly placed in the backs of\r\nthe caterpillars on cabbages, seem to produce their nourishment by their\r\nirritating the sides of their nidus. A vegetable secretion and concretion\r\nis thus produced on oak-leaves by the gall-insect, and by the cynips in the\r\nbedeguar of the rose; and by the young grasshopper on many plants, by which\r\nthe animal surrounds itself with froth. But in no circumstance is\r\nextra-uterine gestation so exactly resembled as by the eggs of a fly, which\r\nare deposited in the frontal sinus of sheep and calves. These eggs float in\r\nsome ounces of fluid collected in a thin pellicle or hydatide. This bag of\r\nfluid compresses the optic nerve on one side, by which the vision being\r\nless distinct in that eye, the animal turns in perpetual circles towards\r\nthe side affected, in order to get a more accurate view of objects; for the\r\nsame reason as in squinting the affected eye is turned away from the object\r\ncontemplated. Sheep in the warm months keep their noses close to the ground\r\nto prevent this fly from so readily getting into their nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe liquor amnii is secreted into the womb as it is required, not only in\r\nrespect to quantity, but, as the digestive powers of the fetus become\r\nformed, this fluid becomes of a different consistence and quality, till it\r\nis exchanged for milk after nativity. Haller. Physiol. V. 1. In the egg the\r\nwhite part, which is analogous to the liquor amnii of quadrupeds, consists\r\nof two distinct parts; one of which is more viscid, and probably more\r\ndifficult of digestion, and more nutritive than the other; and this latter\r\nis used in the last week of incubation. The yolk of the egg is a still\r\nstronger or more nutritive fluid, which is drawn up into the bowels of the\r\nchick just at its exclusion from the shell, and serves it for nourishment\r\nfor a day or two, till it is able to digest, and has learnt to choose the\r\nharder seeds or grains, which are to afford it sustenance. Nothing\r\nanalogous to this yolk is found in the fetus of lactiferous animals, as the\r\nmilk is another nutritive fluid ready prepared for the young progeny.\r\n\r\nThe yolk therefore is not necessary to the spawn of fish, the eggs of\r\ninsects, or for the seeds of vegetables; as their embryons have probably\r\ntheir food presented to them as soon as they are excluded from their\r\nshells, or have extended their roots. Whence it happens that some insects\r\nproduce a living progeny in the spring and summer, and eggs in the autumn;\r\nand some vegetables have living roots or buds produced in the place of\r\nseeds, as the polygonum viviparum, and magical onions. See Botanic Garden,\r\np. 11. art. anthoxanthum.\r\n\r\nThere seems however to be a reservoir of nutriment prepared for some seeds\r\nbesides their cotyledons or seed-leaves, which may be supposed in some\r\nmeasure analogous to the yolk of the egg. Such are the saccharine juices of\r\napples, grapes and other fruits, which supply nutrition to the seeds after\r\nthey fall on the ground. And such is the milky juice in the centre of the\r\ncocoa-nut, and part of the kernel of it; the same I suppose of all other\r\nmonocotyledon seeds, as of the palms, grasses, and lilies.\r\n\r\nII. 1. The process of generation is still involved in impenetrable\r\nobscurity, conjectures may nevertheless be formed concerning some of its\r\ncircumstances. First, the eggs of fish and frogs are impregnated, after\r\nthey leave the body of the female; because they are deposited in a fluid,\r\nand are not therefore covered with a hard shell. It is however remarkable,\r\nthat neither frogs nor fish will part with their spawn without the presence\r\nof the male; on which account female carp and gold-fish in small ponds,\r\nwhere there are no males, frequently die from the distention of their\r\ngrowing spawn. 2. The eggs of fowls, which are laid without being\r\nimpregnated, are seen to contain only the yolk and white, which are\r\nevidently the food or sustenance for the future chick. 3. As the\r\ncicatricula of these eggs is given by the cock, and is evidently the\r\nrudiment of the new animal; we may conclude, that the embryon is produced\r\nby the male, and the proper food and nidus by the female. For if the female\r\nbe supposed to form an equal part of the embryon, why should she form the\r\nwhole of the apparatus for nutriment and for oxygenation? the male in many\r\nanimals is larger, stronger, and digests more food than the female, and\r\ntherefore should contribute as much or more towards the reproduction of the\r\nspecies; but if he contributes only half the embryon and none of the\r\napparatus for sustenance and oxygenation, the division is unequal; the\r\nstrength of the male, and his consumption of food are too great for the\r\neffect, compared with that of the female, which is contrary to the usual\r\ncourse of nature.\r\n\r\nIn objection to this theory of generation it may be said, if the animalcula\r\nin femine, as seen by the microscope, be all of them rudiments of\r\nhomunculi, when but one of them can find a nidus, what a waste nature has\r\nmade of her productions? I do not assert that these moving particles,\r\nvisible by the microscope, are homunciones; perhaps they may be the\r\ncreatures of stagnation or putridity, or perhaps no creatures at all; but\r\nif they are supposed to be rudiments of homunculi, or embryons, such a\r\nprofusion of them corresponds with the general efforts of nature to provide\r\nfor the continuance of her species of animals. Every individual tree\r\nproduces innumerable seeds, and every individual fish innumerable spawn, in\r\nsuch inconceivable abundance as would in a short space of time crowd the\r\nearth and ocean with inhabitants; and these are much more perfect animals\r\nthan the animalcula in femine can be supposed to be, and perish in\r\nuncounted millions. This argument only shews, that the productions of\r\nnature are governed by general laws; and that by a wise superfluity of\r\nprovision she has ensured their continuance.\r\n\r\n2. That the embryon is secreted or produced by the male, and not by the\r\nconjunction of fluids from both male and female, appears from the analogy\r\nof vegetable seeds. In the large flowers, as the tulip, there is no\r\nsimilarity of apparatus between the anthers and the stigma: the seed is\r\nproduced according to the observations of Spallanzani long before the\r\nflowers open, and in consequence long before it can be impregnated, like\r\nthe egg in the pullet. And after the prolific dust is shed on the stigma,\r\nthe seed becomes coagulated in one point first, like the cicatricula of the\r\nimpregnated egg. See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note 38. Now in\r\nthese simple products of nature, if the female contributed to produce the\r\nnew embryon equally with the male, there would probably have been some\r\nvisible similarity of parts for this purpose, besides those necessary for\r\nthe nidus and sustenance of the new progeny. Besides in many flowers the\r\nmales are more numerous than the females, or than the separate uterine\r\ncells in their germs, which would shew, that the office of the male was at\r\nleast as important as that of the female; whereas if the female, besides\r\nproducing the egg or seed, was to produce an equal part of the embryon, the\r\noffice of reproduction would be unequally divided between them.\r\n\r\nAdd to this, that in the most simple kind of vegetable reproduction, I mean\r\nthe buds of trees, which are their viviparous offspring, the leaf is\r\nevidently the parent of the bud, which rises in its bosom, according to the\r\nobservation of Linnaeus. This leaf consists of absorbent vessels, and\r\npulmonary ones, to obtain its nutriment, and to impregnate it with oxygene.\r\nThis simple piece of living organization is also furnished with a power of\r\nreproduction; and as the new offspring is thus supported adhering to its\r\nfather, it needs no mother to supply it with a nidus, and nutriment, and\r\noxygenation; and hence no female leaf has existence.\r\n\r\nI conceive that the vessels between the bud and the leaf communicate or\r\ninosculate; and that the bud is thus served with vegetable blood, that is,\r\nwith both nutriment and oxygenation, till the death of the parent-leaf in\r\nautumn. And in this respect it differs from the fetus of viviparous\r\nanimals. Secondly, that then the bark-vessels belonging to the dead-leaf,\r\nand in which I suppose a kind of manna to have been deposited, become now\r\nthe placental vessels, if they may be so called, of the new bud. From the\r\nvernal sap thus produced of one sugar-maple-tree in New-York and in\r\nPennsylvania, five or six pounds of good sugar may be made annually without\r\ndestroying the tree. Account of maple-sugar by B. Rushes. London, Phillips.\r\n(See Botanic Garden, Part I. additional note on vegetable placentation.)\r\n\r\nThese vessels, when the warmth of the vernal sun hatches the young bud,\r\nserve it with a saccharine nutriment, till it acquires leaves of its own,\r\nand shoots a new system of absorbents down the bark and root of the tree,\r\njust as the farinaceous or oily matter in seeds, and the saccharine matter\r\nin fruits, serve their embryons with nutriment, till they acquire leaves\r\nand roots. This analogy is as forceable in so obscure a subject, as it is\r\ncurious, and may in large buds, as of the horse-chesnut, be almost seen by\r\nthe naked eye; if with a penknife the remaining rudiment of the last year's\r\nleaf, and of the new bud in its bosom, be cut away slice by slice. The\r\nseven ribs of the last year's leaf will be seen to have arisen from the\r\npith in seven distinct points making a curve; and the new bud to have been\r\nproduced in their centre, and to have pierced the alburnum and cortex, and\r\ngrown without the assistance of a mother. A similar process may be seen on\r\ndissecting a tulip-root in winter; the leaves, which inclosed the last\r\nyear's flower-stalk, were not necessary for the flower; but each of these\r\nwas the father of a new bud, which may be now found at its base; and which,\r\nas it adheres to the parent, required no mother.\r\n\r\nThis paternal offspring of vegetables, I mean their buds and bulbs, is\r\nattended with a very curious circumstance; and that is, that they exactly\r\nresemble their parents, as is observable in grafting fruit-trees, and in\r\npropagating flower-roots; whereas the seminal offspring of plants, being\r\nsupplied with nutriment by the mother, is liable to perpetual variation.\r\nThus also in the vegetable class dioicia, where the male flowers are\r\nproduced on one tree, and the female ones on another; the buds of the male\r\ntrees uniformly produce either male flowers, or other buds similar to\r\nthemselves; and the buds of the female trees produce either female flowers,\r\nor other buds similar to themselves; whereas the seeds of these trees\r\nproduce either male or female plants. From this analogy of the production\r\nof vegetable buds without a mother, I contend that the mother does not\r\ncontribute to the formation of the living ens in animal generation, but is\r\nnecessary only for supplying its nutriment and oxygenation.\r\n\r\nThere is another vegetable fact published by M. Koelreuter, which he calls\r\n\"a complete metamorphosis of one natural species of plants into another,\"\r\nwhich shews, that in seeds as well as in buds, the embryon proceeds from\r\nthe male parent, though the form of the subsequent mature plant is in part\r\ndependant on the female. M. Koelreuter impregnated a stigma of the\r\nnicotiana rustica with the farina of the nicotiana paniculata, and obtained\r\nprolific seeds from it. With the plants which sprung from these seeds, he\r\nrepeated the experiment, impregnating them with the farina of the nicotiana\r\npaniculata. As the mule plants which he thus produced were prolific, he\r\ncontinued to impregnate them for many generations with the farina of the\r\nnicotiana paniculata, and they became more and more like the male parent,\r\ntill he at length obtained six plants in every respect perfectly similar to\r\nthe nicotiana paniculata; and in no respect resembling their female parent\r\nthe nicotiana rustica. _Blumenbach_ on Generation.\r\n\r\n3. It is probable that the insects, which are said to require but one\r\nimpregnation for six generations, as the aphis (see Amenit. Academ.)\r\nproduce their progeny in the manner above described, that is, without a\r\nmother, and not without a father; and thus experience a lucina sine\r\nconcubitu. Those who have attended to the habits of the polypus, which is\r\nfound in the stagnant water of our ditches in July, affirm, that the young\r\nones branch out from the side of the parent like the buds of trees, and\r\nafter a time separate themselves from them. This is so analogous to the\r\nmanner in which the buds of trees appear to be produced, that these polypi\r\nmay be considered as all male animals, producing embryons, which require no\r\nmother to supply them with a nidus, or with nutriment, and oxygenation.\r\n\r\nThis lateral or lineal generation of plants, not only obtains in the buds\r\nof trees, which continue to adhere to them, but is beautifully seen in the\r\nwires of knot-grass, polygonum aviculare, and in those of strawberries,\r\nfragaria vesca. In these an elongated creeping bud is protruded, and, where\r\nit touches the ground, takes root, and produces a new plant derived from\r\nits father, from which it acquires both nutriment and oxygenation; and in\r\nconsequence needs no maternal apparatus for these purposes. In viviparous\r\nflowers, as those of allium magicum, and polygonum viviparum, the anthers\r\nand the stigmas become effete and perish; and the lateral or paternal\r\noffspring succeeds instead of seeds, which adhere till they are\r\nsufficiently mature, and then fall upon the ground, and take root like\r\nother bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe lateral production of plants by wires, while each new plant is thus\r\nchained to its parent, and continues to put forth another and another, as\r\nthe wire creeps onward on the ground, is exactly resembled by the\r\ntape-worm, or tænia, so often found in the bowels, stretching itself in a\r\nchain quite from the stomach to the rectum. Linnæus asserts, \"that it grows\r\nold at one extremity, while it continues to generate young ones at the\r\nother, proceeding ad infinitum, like a root of grass. The separate joints\r\nare called gourd-worms, and propagate new joints like the parent without\r\nend, each joint being furnished with its proper mouth, and organs of\r\ndigestion.\" Systema naturæ. Vermes tenia. In this animal there evidently\r\nappears a power of reproduction without any maternal apparatus for the\r\npurpose of supplying nutriment and oxygenation to the embryon, as it\r\nremains attached to its father till its maturity. The volvox globator,\r\nwhich is a transparent animal, is said by Linnæus to bear within it sons\r\nand grand-sons to the fifth generation. These are probably living fetuses,\r\nproduced by the father, of different degrees of maturity, to be detruded at\r\ndifferent periods of time, like the unimpregnated eggs of various sizes,\r\nwhich are found in poultry; and as they are produced without any known\r\ncopulation, contribute to evince, that the living embryon in other orders\r\nof animals is formed by the male-parent, and not by the mother, as one\r\nparent has the power to produce it.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the reproduction of animals from a single living filament of\r\ntheir fathers, appears to have been shadowed or allegorized in the curious\r\naccount in sacred writ of the formation of Eve from a rib of Adam.\r\n\r\nFrom all these analogies I conclude, that the embryon is produced solely by\r\nthe male, and that the female supplies it with a proper nidus, with\r\nsustenance, and with oxygenation; and that the idea of the semen of the\r\nmale constituting only a stimulus to the egg of the female, exciting it\r\ninto life, (as held by some philosophers) has no support from experiment or\r\nanalogy.\r\n\r\nIII. 1. Many ingenious philosophers have found so great difficulty in\r\nconceiving the manner of the reproduction of animals, that they have\r\nsupposed all the numerous progeny, to have existed in miniature in the\r\nanimal originally created; and that these infinitely minute forms are only\r\nevolved or distended, as the embryon increases in the womb. This idea,\r\nbesides its being unsupported by any analogy we are acquainted with,\r\nascribes a greater tenuity to organized matter, than we can readily admit;\r\nas these included embryons are supposed each of them to consist of the\r\nvarious and complicate parts of animal bodies: they must possess a much\r\ngreater degree of minuteness, than that which was ascribed to the devils\r\nthat tempted St. Anthony; of whom 20,000 were said to have been able to\r\ndance a saraband on the point of the finest needle without incommoding each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n2. Others have supposed, that all the parts of the embryon are formed in\r\nthe male, previous to its being deposited in the egg or uterus; and that it\r\nis then only to have its parts evolved or distended as mentioned above; but\r\nthis is only to get rid of one difficulty by proposing another equally\r\nincomprehensible: they found it difficult to conceive, how the embryon\r\ncould be formed in the uterus or egg, and therefore wished it to be formed\r\nbefore it came thither. In answer to both these doctrines it may be\r\nobserved, 1st, that some animals, as the crab-fish, can reproduce a whole\r\nlimb, as a leg which has been broken off; others, as worms and snails, can\r\nreproduce a head, or a tail, when either of them has been cut away; and\r\nthat hence in these animals at least a part can be formed anew, which\r\ncannot be supposed to have existed previously in miniature.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are new parts or new vessels produced in many diseases, as\r\non the cornea of the eye in ophthalmy, in wens and cancers, which cannot be\r\nsupposed to have had a prototype or original miniature in the embryon.\r\n\r\nThirdly, how could mule-animals be produced, which partake of the forms of\r\nboth the parents, if the original embryon was a miniature existing in the\r\nsemen of the male parent? if an embryon of the male ass was only expanded,\r\nno resemblance to the mare could exist in the mule.\r\n\r\nThis mistaken idea of the extension of parts seems to have had its rise\r\nfrom the mature man resembling the general form of the fetus; and from\r\nthence it was believed, that the parts of the fetus were distended into the\r\nman; whereas they have increased 100 times in weight, as well as 100 times\r\nin size; now no one will call the additional 99 parts a distention of the\r\noriginal one part in respect to weight. Thus the uterus during pregnancy is\r\ngreatly enlarged in thickness and solidity as well as in capacity, and\r\nhence must have acquired this additional size by accretion of new parts,\r\nnot by an extension of the old ones; the familiar act of blowing up the\r\nbladder of an animal recently slaughtered has led our imaginations to apply\r\nthis idea of distention to the increase of size from natural growth; which\r\nhowever must be owing to the apposition of new parts; as it is evinced from\r\nthe increase of weight along with the increase of dimension; and is even\r\nvisible to our eyes in the elongation of our hair from the colour of its\r\nends; or when it has been dyed on the head; and in the growth of our nails\r\nfrom the specks sometimes observable on them; and in the increase of the\r\nwhite crescent at their roots, and in the growth of new flesh in wounds,\r\nwhich consists of new nerves as well as of new blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n3. Lastly, Mr. Buffon has with great ingenuity imagined the existence of\r\ncertain organic particles, which are supposed to be partly alive, and\r\npartly mechanic springs. The latter of these were discovered by Mr. Needham\r\nin the milt or male organ of a species of cuttle fish, called calmar; the\r\nformer, or living animalcula, are found in both male and female secretions,\r\nin the infusions of seeds, as of pepper, in the jelly of roasted veal, and\r\nin all other animal and vegetable substances. These organic particles he\r\nsupposes to exist in the spermatic fluids of both sexes, and that they are\r\nderived thither from every part of the body, and must therefore resemble,\r\nas he supposes, the parts from whence they are derived. These organic\r\nparticles he believes to be in constant activity, till they become mixed in\r\nthe womb, and then they instantly join and produce an embryon or fetus\r\nsimilar to the two parents.\r\n\r\nMany objections might be adduced to this fanciful theory, I shall only\r\nmention two. First, that it is analogous to no known animal laws. And\r\nsecondly, that as these fluids, replete with organic particles derived both\r\nfrom the male and female organs, are supposed to be similar; there is no\r\nreason why the mother should not produce a female embryon without the\r\nassistance of the male, and realize the lucina sine concubitu.\r\n\r\nIV. 1. I conceive the primordium, or rudiment of the embryon, as secreted\r\nfrom the blood of the parent, to consist of a simple living filament as a\r\nmuscular fibre; which I suppose to be an extremity of a nerve of\r\nloco-motion, as a fibre of the retina is an extremity of a nerve of\r\nsensation; as for instance one of the fibrils, which compose the mouth of\r\nan absorbent vessel; I suppose this living filament, of whatever form it\r\nmay be, whether sphere, cube, or cylinder, to be endued with the capability\r\nof being excited into action by certain kinds of stimulus. By the stimulus\r\nof the surrounding fluid, in which it is received from the male, it may\r\nbend into a ring; and thus form the beginning of a tube. Such moving\r\nfilaments, and such rings, are described by those, who have attended to\r\nmicroscopic animalcula. This living ring may now embrace or absorb a\r\nnutritive particle of the fluid, in which it swims; and by drawing it into\r\nits pores, or joining it by compression to its extremities, may increase\r\nits own length or crassitude; and by degrees the living ring may become a\r\nliving tube.\r\n\r\n2. With this new organization, or accretion of parts, new kinds of\r\nirritability may commence; for so long as there was but one living organ,\r\nit could only be supposed to possess irritability; since sensibility may be\r\nconceived to be an extension of the effect of irritability over the rest of\r\nthe system. These new kinds of irritability and of sensibility in\r\nconsequence of new organization, appear from variety of facts in the more\r\nmature animal; thus the formation of the testes, and consequent secretion\r\nof the semen, occasion the passion of lust; the lungs must be previously\r\nformed before their exertions to obtain fresh air can exist; the throat or\r\noesophagus must be formed previous to the sensation or appetites of hunger\r\nand thirst; one of which seems to reside at the upper end, and the other at\r\nthe lower end of that canal.\r\n\r\nThus also the glans penis, when it is distended with blood, acquires a new\r\nsensibility, and a new appetency. The same occurs to the nipples of the\r\nbreasts of female animals, when they are distended with blood, they acquire\r\nthe new appetency of giving milk. So inflamed tendons and membranes, and\r\neven bones, acquire new sensations; and the parts of mutilated animals, as\r\nof wounded snails, and polypi, and crabs, are reproduced; and at the same\r\ntime acquire sensations adapted to their situations. Thus when the head of\r\na snail is reproduced after decollation with a sharp rasor, those curious\r\ntelescopic eyes are also reproduced, and acquire their sensibility to\r\nlight, as well as their adapted muscles for retraction on the approach of\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nWith every new change, therefore, of organic form, or addition of organic\r\nparts, I suppose a new kind of irritability or of sensibility to be\r\nproduced; such varieties of irritability or of sensibility exist in our\r\nadult state in the glands; every one of which is furnished with an\r\nirritability, or a taste, or appetency, and a consequent mode of action\r\npeculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nIn this manner I conceive the vessels of the jaws to produce those of the\r\nteeth, those of the fingers to produce the nails, those of the skin to\r\nproduce the hair; in the same manner as afterwards about the age of puberty\r\nthe beard and other great changes in the form of the body, and disposition\r\nof the mind, are produced in consequence of the new secretion of semen; for\r\nif the animal is deprived of this secretion those changes do not take\r\nplace. These changes I conceive to be formed not by elongation or\r\ndistention of primeval stamina, but by apposition of parts; as the mature\r\ncrab-fish, when deprived of a limb, in a certain space of time has power to\r\nregenerate it; and the tadpole puts forth its feet long after its exclusion\r\nfrom the spawn; and the caterpillar in changing into a butterfly acquires a\r\nnew form, with new powers, new sensations, and new desires.\r\n\r\nThe natural history of butterflies, and moths, and beetles, and gnats, is\r\nfull of curiosity; some of them pass many months, and others even years, in\r\ntheir caterpillar or grub state; they then rest many weeks without food,\r\nsuspended in the air, buried in the earth, or submersed in water; and\r\nchange themselves during this time into an animal apparently of a different\r\nnature; the stomachs of some of them, which before digested vegetable\r\nleaves or roots, now only digest honey; they have acquired wings for the\r\npurpose of seeking this new food, and a long proboscis to collect it from\r\nflowers, and I suppose a sense of smell to detect the secret places in\r\nflowers, where it is formed. The moths, which fly by night, have a much\r\nlonger proboscis rolled up under their chins like a watch spring; which\r\nthey extend to collect the honey from flowers in their sleeping state; when\r\nthey are closed, and the nectaries in consequence more difficult to be\r\nplundered. The beetle kind are furnished with an external covering of a\r\nhard material to their wings, that they may occasionally again make holes\r\nin the earth, in which they passed the former state of their existence.\r\n\r\nBut what most of all distinguishes these new animals is, that they are new\r\nfurnished with the powers of reproduction; and that they now differ from\r\neach other in sex, which does not appear in their caterpillar or grub\r\nstate. In some of them the change from a caterpillar into a butterfly or\r\nmoth seems to be accomplished for the sole purpose of their propagation;\r\nsince they immediately die after this is finished, and take no food in the\r\ninterim, as the silk-worm in this climate; though it is possible, it might\r\ntake honey as food, if it was presented to it. For in general it would\r\nseem, that food of a more stimulating kind, the honey of vegetables instead\r\nof their leaves, was necessary for the purpose of the seminal reproduction\r\nof these animals, exactly similar to what happens in vegetables; in these\r\nthe juices of the earth are sufficient for their purpose of reproduction by\r\nbuds or bulbs; in which the new plant seems to be formed by irritative\r\nmotions, like the growth of their other parts, as their leaves or roots;\r\nbut for the purpose of seminal or amatorial reproduction, where sensation\r\nis required, a more stimulating food becomes necessary for the anther, and\r\nstigma; and this food is honey; as explained in Sect. XIII. on Vegetable\r\nAnimation.\r\n\r\nThe gnat and the tadpole resemble each other in their change from natant\r\nanimals with gills into aerial animals with lungs; and in their change of\r\nthe element in which they live; and probably of the food, with which they\r\nare supported; and lastly, with their acquiring in their new state the\r\ndifference of sex, and the organs of seminal or amatorial reproduction.\r\nWhile the polypus, who is their companion in their former state of life,\r\nnot being allowed to change his form and element, can only propagate like\r\nvegetable buds by the same kind of irritative motions, which produces the\r\ngrowth of his own body, without the seminal or amatorial propagation, which\r\nrequires sensation; and which in gnats and tadpoles seems to require a\r\nchange both of food and of respiration.\r\n\r\nFrom hence I conclude, that with the acquisition of new parts, new\r\nsensations, and new desires, as well as new powers, are produced; and this\r\nby accretion to the old ones, and not by distention of them. And finally,\r\nthat the most essential parts of the system, as the brain for the purpose\r\nof distributing the power of life, and the placenta for the purpose of\r\noxygenating the blood, and the additional absorbent vessels for the purpose\r\nof acquiring aliment, are first formed by the irritations above mentioned,\r\nand by the pleasurable sensations attending those irritations, and by the\r\nexertions in consequence of painful sensations, similar to those of hunger\r\nand suffocation. After these an apparatus of limbs for future uses, or for\r\nthe purpose of moving the body in its present natant state, and of lungs\r\nfor future respiration, and of testes for future reproduction, are formed\r\nby the irritations and sensations, and consequent exertions of the parts\r\npreviously existing, and to which the new parts are to be attached.\r\n\r\n3. In confirmation of these ideas it may be observed, that all the parts of\r\nthe body endeavour to grow, or to make additional parts to themselves\r\nthroughout our lives; but are restrained by the parts immediately\r\ncontaining them; thus, if the skin be taken away, the fleshy parts beneath\r\nsoon shoot out new granulations, called by the vulgar proud flesh. If the\r\nperiosteum be removed, a similar growth commences from the bone. Now in the\r\ncase of the imperfect embryon, the containing or confining parts are not\r\nyet supposed to be formed, and hence there is nothing to restrain its\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n4. By the parts of the embryon being thus produced by new apportions, many\r\nphenomena both of animal and vegetable productions receive an easier\r\nexplanation; such as that many fetuses are deficient at the extremities, as\r\nin a finger or a toe, or in the end of the tongue, or in what is called a\r\nhare-lip with deficiency of the palate. For if there should be a deficiency\r\nin the quantity of the first nutritive particles laid up in the egg for the\r\nreception of the first living filament, the extreme parts, as being last\r\nformed, must shew this deficiency by their being imperfect.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the growth of the embryon accords also with the production of\r\nsome monstrous births, which consist of a duplicature of the limbs, as\r\nchickens with four legs; which could not occur, if the fetus was formed by\r\nthe distention of an original stamen, or miniature. For if there should be\r\na superfluity of the first nutritive particles laid up in the egg for the\r\nfirst living filament; it is easy to conceive, that a duplicature of some\r\nparts may be formed. And that such superfluous nourishment sometimes\r\nexists, is evinced by the double yolks in some eggs, which I suppose were\r\nthus formed previous to their impregnation by the exuberant nutriment of\r\nthe hen.\r\n\r\nThis idea is confirmed by the analogy of the monsters in the vegetable\r\nworld also; in which a duplicate or triplicate production of various parts\r\nof the flower is observable, as a triple nectary in some columbines, and a\r\ntriple petal in some primroses; and which are supposed to be produced by\r\nabundant nourishment.\r\n\r\n5. If the embryon be received into a fluid, whose stimulus is different in\r\nsome degree from the natural, as in the production of mule-animals, the new\r\nirritabilities or sensibilities acquired by the increasing or growing\r\norganized parts may differ, and thence produce parts not similar to the\r\nfather, but of a kind belonging in part to the mother; and thus, though the\r\noriginal stamen or living ens was derived totally from the father, yet new\r\nirritabilities or sensibilities being excited, a change of form\r\ncorresponding with them will be produced. Nor could the production of mules\r\nexist, if the stamen or miniature of all the parts of the embryon is\r\npreviously formed in the male semen, and is only distended by nourishment\r\nin the female uterus. Whereas this difficulty ceases, if the embryon be\r\nsupposed to consist of a living filament, which acquires or makes new parts\r\nwith new irritabilities, as it advances in its growth.\r\n\r\nThe form, solidity, and colour, of the particles of nutriment laid up for\r\nthe reception of the first living filament, as well as their peculiar kind\r\nof stimulus, may contribute to produce a difference in the form, solidity,\r\nand colour of the fetus, so as to resemble the mother, as it advances in\r\nlife. This also may especially happen during the first state of the\r\nexistence of the embryon, before it has acquired organs, which can change\r\nthese first nutritive particles, as explained in No. 5. 2. of this Section.\r\nAnd as these nutritive particles are supposed to be similar to those, which\r\nare formed for her own nutrition, it follows that the fetus should so far\r\nresemble the mother.\r\n\r\nThis explains, why hereditary diseases may be derived either from the male\r\nor female parent, as well as the peculiar form of either of their bodies.\r\nSome of these hereditary diseases are simply owing to a deficient activity\r\nof a part of the system, as of the absorbent vessels, which open into the\r\ncells or cavities of the body, and thus occasion dropsies. Others are at\r\nthe same time owing to an increase of sensation, as in scrophula and\r\nconsumption; in these the obstruction of the fluids is first caused by the\r\ninirritability of the vessels, and the inflammation and ulcers which\r\nsucceed, are caused by the consequent increase of sensation in the\r\nobstructed part. Other hereditary diseases, as the epilepsy, and other\r\nconvulsions, consist in too great voluntary exertions in consequence of\r\ndisagreeable sensation in some particular diseased part. Now as the pains,\r\nwhich occasion these convulsions, are owing to defect of the action of the\r\ndiseased part, as shewn in Sect. XXXIV. it is plain, that all these\r\nhereditary diseases may have their origin either from defective\r\nirritability derived from the father, or from deficiency of the stimulus of\r\nthe nutriment derived from the mother. In either case the effect would be\r\nsimilar; as a scrophulous race is frequently produced among the poor from\r\nthe deficient stimulus of bad diet, or of hunger; and among the rich, by a\r\ndeficient irritability from their having been long accustomed to too great\r\nstimulus, as of vinous spirit.\r\n\r\n6. From this account of reproduction it appears, that all animals have a\r\nsimilar origin, viz. from a single living filament; and that the difference\r\nof their forms and qualities has arisen only from the different\r\nirritabilities and sensibilities, or voluntarities, or associabilities, of\r\nthis original living filament; and perhaps in some degree from the\r\ndifferent forms of the particles of the fluids, by which it has been at\r\nfirst stimulated into activity. And that from hence, as Linnæus has\r\nconjectured in respect to the vegetable world, it is not impossible, but\r\nthe great variety of species of animals, which now tenant the earth, may\r\nhave had their origin from the mixture of a few natural orders. And that\r\nthose animal and vegetable mules, which could continue their species, have\r\ndone so, and constitute the numerous families of animals and vegetables\r\nwhich now exist; and that those mules, which were produced with imperfect\r\norgans of generation, perished without reproduction, according to the\r\nobservation of Aristotle; and are the animals, which we now call mules. See\r\nBotanic Garden, Part II. Note on Dianthus.\r\n\r\nSuch a promiscuous intercourse of animals is said to exist at this day in\r\nNew South Wales by Captain Hunter. And that not only amongst the quadrupeds\r\nand birds of different kinds, but even amongst the fish, and, as he\r\nbelieves, amongst the vegetables. He speaks of an animal between the\r\nopossum and the kangaroo, from the size of a sheep to that of a rat. Many\r\nfish seemed to partake of the shark; some with a shark's head and\r\nshoulders, and the hind part of a shark; others with a shark's head and the\r\nbody of a mullet; and some with a shark's head and the flat body of a\r\nsting-ray. Many birds partake of the parrot; some have the head, neck, and\r\nbill of a parrot, with long straight feet and legs; others with legs and\r\nfeet of a parrot, with head and neck of a sea gull. Voyage to South Wales\r\nby Captain John Hunter, p. 68.\r\n\r\n7. All animals therefore, I contend, have a similar cause of their\r\norganization, originating from a single living filament, endued indeed with\r\ndifferent kinds of irritabilities and sensibilities, or of animal\r\nappetencies; which exist in every gland, and in every moving organ of the\r\nbody, and are as essential to living organization as chemical affinities\r\nare to certain combinations of inanimate matter.\r\n\r\nIf I might be indulged to make a simile in a philosophical work, I should\r\nsay, that the animal appetencies are not only perhaps less numerous\r\noriginally than the chemical affinities; but that like these latter, they\r\nchange with every new combination; thus vital air and azote, when combined,\r\nproduce nitrous acid; which now acquires the property of dissolving silver;\r\nso with every new additional part to the embryon, as of the throat or\r\nlungs, I suppose a new animal appetency to be produced.\r\n\r\nIn this early formation of the embryon from the irritabilities,\r\nsensibilities, and associabilities, and consequent appetencies, the faculty\r\nof volition can scarcely be supposed to have had its birth. For about what\r\ncan the fetus deliberate, when it has no choice of objects? But in the more\r\nadvanced state of the fetus, it evidently possesses volition; as it\r\nfrequently changes its attitude, though it seems to sleep the greatest part\r\nof its time; and afterwards the power of volition contributes to change or\r\nalter many parts of the body during its growth to manhood, by our early\r\nmodes of exertion in the various departments of life. All these faculties\r\nthen constitute the vis fabricatrix, and the vis conservatrix, as well as\r\nthe vis medicatrix of nature, so much spoken of, but so little understood\r\nby philosophers.\r\n\r\n8. When we revolve in our minds, first, the great changes, which we see\r\nnaturally produced in animals after their nativity, as in the production of\r\nthe butterfly with painted wings from the crawling caterpillar; or of the\r\nrespiring frog from the subnatant tadpole; from the feminine boy to the\r\nbearded man, and from the infant girl to the lactescent woman; both which\r\nchanges may be prevented by certain mutilations of the glands necessary to\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when we think over the great changes introduced into various\r\nanimals by artificial or accidental cultivation, as in horses, which we\r\nhave exercised for the different purposes of strength or swiftness, in\r\ncarrying burthens or in running races; or in dogs, which have been\r\ncultivated for strength and courage, as the bull-dog; or for acuteness of\r\nhis sense or smell, as the hound and spaniel; or for the swiftness of his\r\nfoot, as the greyhound; or for his swimming in the water, or for drawing\r\nsnow-sledges, as the rough-haired dogs of the north; or lastly, as a\r\nplay-dog for children, as the lap-dog; with the changes of the forms of the\r\ncattle, which have been domesticated from the greatest antiquity, as\r\ncamels, and sheep; which have undergone so total a transformation, that we\r\nare now ignorant from what species of wild animals they had their origin.\r\nAdd to these the great changes of shape and colour, which we daily see\r\nproduced in smaller animals from our domestication of them, as rabbits, or\r\npigeons; or from the difference of climates and even of seasons; thus the\r\nsheep of warm climates are covered with hair instead of wool; and the hares\r\nand partridges of the latitudes, which are long buried in snow, become\r\nwhite during the winter months; add to these the various changes produced\r\nin the forms of mankind, by their early modes of exertion; or by the\r\ndiseases occasioned by their habits of life; both of which became\r\nhereditary, and that through many generations. Those who labour at the\r\nanvil, the oar, or the loom, as well as those who carry sedan-chairs, or\r\nwho have been educated to dance upon the rope, are distinguishable by the\r\nshape of their limbs; and the diseases occasioned by intoxication deform\r\nthe countenance with leprous eruptions, or the body with tumid viscera, or\r\nthe joints with knots and distortions.\r\n\r\nThirdly, when we enumerate the great changes produced in the species of\r\nanimals before their nativity; these are such as resemble the form or\r\ncolour of their parents, which have been altered by the cultivation or\r\naccidents above related, and are thus continued to their posterity. Or they\r\nare changes produced by the mixture of species as in mules; or changes\r\nproduced probably by the exuberance of nourishment supplied to the fetus,\r\nas in monstrous births with additional limbs; many of these enormities of\r\nshape are propagated, and continued as a variety at least, if not as a new\r\nspecies of animal. I have seen a breed of cats with an additional claw on\r\nevery foot; of poultry also with an additional claw, and with wings to\r\ntheir feet; and of others without rumps. Mr. Buffon mentions a breed of\r\ndogs without tails, which are common at Rome and at Naples, which he\r\nsupposes to have been produced by a custom long established of cutting\r\ntheir tails close off. There are many kinds of pigeons, admired for their\r\npeculiarities, which are monsters thus produced and propagated. And to\r\nthese must be added, the changes produced by the imagination of the male\r\nparent, as will be treated of more at large in No. VI. of this Section.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider all these changes of animal form, and innumerable others,\r\nwhich may be collected from the books of natural history; we cannot but be\r\nconvinced, that the fetus or embryon is formed by apposition of new parts,\r\nand not by the distention of a primordial nest of germs, included one\r\nwithin another, like the cups of a conjurer.\r\n\r\nFourthly, when we revolve in our minds the great similarity of structure,\r\nwhich obtains in all the warm-blooded animals, as well quadrupeds, birds,\r\nand amphibious animals, as in mankind; from the mouse and bat to the\r\nelephant and whale; one is led to conclude, that they have alike been\r\nproduced from a similar living filament. In some this filament in its\r\nadvance to maturity has acquired hands and fingers, with a fine sense of\r\ntouch, as in mankind. In others it has acquired claws or talons, as in\r\ntygers and eagles. In others, toes with an intervening web, or membrane, as\r\nin seals and geese. In others it has acquired cloven hoofs, as in cows and\r\nswine; and whole hoofs in others, as in the horse. While in the bird kind\r\nthis original living filament has put forth wings instead of arms or legs,\r\nand feathers instead of hair. In some it has protruded horns on the\r\nforehead instead of teeth in the fore part of the upper jaw; in others\r\ntushes instead of horns; and in others beaks instead of either. And all\r\nthis exactly as is daily seen in the transmutations of the tadpole, which\r\nacquires legs and lungs, when he wants them; and loses his tail, when it is\r\nno longer of service to him.\r\n\r\nFifthly, from their first rudiment, or primordium, to the termination of\r\ntheir lives, all animals undergo perpetual transformations; which are in\r\npart produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and\r\naversions, of their pleasures and their pains, or of irritations, or of\r\nassociations; and many of these acquired forms or propensities are\r\ntransmitted to their posterity. See Sect. XXXI. 1.\r\n\r\nAs air and water are supplied to animals in sufficient profusion, the three\r\ngreat objects of desire, which have changed the forms of many animals by\r\ntheir exertions to gratify them, are those of lust, hunger, and security. A\r\ngreat want of one part of the animal world has consisted in the desire of\r\nthe exclusive possession of the females; and these have acquired weapons to\r\ncombat each other for this purpose, as the very thick, shield-like, horny\r\nskin on the shoulder of the boar is a defence only against animals of his\r\nown species, who strike obliquely upwards, nor are his tushes for other\r\npurposes, except to defend himself, as he is not naturally a carnivorous\r\nanimal. So the horns of the stag are sharp to offend his adversary, but are\r\nbranched for the purpose of parrying or receiving the thrusts of horns\r\nsimilar to his own, and have therefore been formed for the purpose of\r\ncombating other stags for the exclusive possession of the females; who are\r\nobserved, like the ladies in the times of chivalry, to attend the car of\r\nthe victor.\r\n\r\nThe birds, which do not carry food to their young, and do not therefore\r\nmarry, are armed with spurs for the purpose of fighting for the exclusive\r\npossession of the females, as cocks and quails. It is certain that these\r\nweapons are not provided for their defence against other adversaries,\r\nbecause the females of these species are without this armour. The final\r\ncause of this contest amongst the males seems to be, that the strongest and\r\nmost active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nAnother great want consists in the means of procuring food, which has\r\ndiversified the forms of all species of animals. Thus the nose of the swine\r\nhas become hard for the purpose of turning up the soil in search of insects\r\nand of roots. The trunk of the elephant is an elongation of the nose for\r\nthe purpose of pulling down the branches of trees for his food, and for\r\ntaking up water without bending his knees. Beasts of prey have acquired\r\nstrong jaws or talons. Cattle have acquired a rough tongue and a rough\r\npalate to pull off the blades of grass, as cows and sheep. Some birds have\r\nacquired harder beaks to crack nuts, as the parrot. Others have acquired\r\nbeaks adapted to break the harder seeds, as sparrows. Others for the softer\r\nseeds of flowers, or the buds of trees, as the finches. Other birds have\r\nacquired long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of insects or\r\nroots, as woodcocks; and others broad ones to filtrate the water of lakes,\r\nand to retain aquatic insects. All which seem to have been gradually\r\nproduced during many generations by the perpetual endeavour of the\r\ncreatures to supply the want of food, and to have been delivered to their\r\nposterity with constant improvement of them for the purposes required.\r\n\r\nThe third great want amongst animals is that of security, which seems much\r\nto have diversified the forms of their bodies and the colour of them; these\r\nconsist in the means of escaping other animals more powerful than\r\nthemselves. Hence some animals have acquired wings instead of legs, as the\r\nsmaller birds, for the purpose of escape. Others great length of fin, or of\r\nmembrane, as the flying fish, and the bat. Others great swiftness of foot,\r\nas the hare. Others have acquired hard or armed shells, as the tortoise and\r\nthe echinus marinus.\r\n\r\nMr. Osbeck, a pupil of Linnæus, mentions the American frog fish, Lophius\r\nHistrio, which inhabits the large floating islands of sea-weed about the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and has fulcra resembling leaves, that the fishes of\r\nprey may mistake it for the sea-weed, which it inhabits. Voyage to China,\r\np. 113.\r\n\r\nThe contrivances for the purposes of security extend even to vegetables, as\r\nis seen in the wonderful and various means of their concealing or defending\r\ntheir honey from insects, and their seeds from birds. On the other hand\r\nswiftness of wing has been acquired by hawks and swallows to pursue their\r\nprey; and a proboscis of admirable structure has been acquired by the bee,\r\nthe moth, and the humming bird, for the purpose of plundering the nectaries\r\nof flowers. All which seem to have been formed by the original living\r\nfilament, excited into action by the necessities of the creatures, which\r\npossess them, and on which their existence depends.\r\n\r\nFrom thus meditating on the great similarity of the structure of the\r\nwarm-blooded animals, and at the same time of the great changes they\r\nundergo both before and after their nativity; and by considering in how\r\nminute a portion of time many of the changes of animals above described\r\nhave been produced; would it be too bold to imagine, that in the great\r\nlength of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages\r\nbefore the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to\r\nimagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living\r\nfilament, which THE GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality, with the power\r\nof acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by\r\nirritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing\r\nthe faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of\r\ndelivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world\r\nwithout end!\r\n\r\nSixthly, The cold-blooded animals, as the fish-tribes, which are furnished\r\nwith but one ventricle of the heart, and with gills instead of lungs, and\r\nwith fins instead of feet or wings, bear a great similarity to each other;\r\nbut they differ, nevertheless, so much in their general structure from the\r\nwarm-blooded animals, that it may not seem probable at first view, that the\r\nsame living filament could have given origin to this kingdom of animals, as\r\nto the former. Yet are there some creatures, which unite or partake of both\r\nthese orders of animation, as the whales and seals; and more particularly\r\nthe frog, who changes from an aquatic animal furnished with gills to an\r\naerial one furnished with lungs.\r\n\r\nThe numerous tribes of insects without wings, from the spider to the\r\nscorpion, from the flea to the lobster; or with wings, from the gnat and\r\nthe ant to the wasp and the dragon-fly, differ so totally from each other,\r\nand from the red-blooded classes above described, both in the forms of\r\ntheir bodies, and their modes of life; besides the organ of sense, which\r\nthey seem to possess in their antennæ or horns, to which it has been\r\nthought by some naturalists, that other creatures have nothing similar;\r\nthat it can scarcely be supposed that this nation of animals could have\r\nbeen produced by the same kind of living filament, as the red-blooded\r\nclasses above mentioned. And yet the changes which many of them undergo in\r\ntheir early state to that of their maturity, are as different, as one\r\nanimal can be from another. As those of the gnat, which passes his early\r\nstate in water, and then stretching out his new wings, and expanding his\r\nnew lungs, rises in the air; as of the caterpillar, and bee-nymph, which\r\nfeed on vegetable leaves or farina, and at length bursting from their\r\nself-formed graves, become beautiful winged inhabitants of the skies,\r\njourneying from flower to flower, and nourished by the ambrosial food of\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nThere is still another class of animals, which are termed vermes by\r\nLinnæus, which are without feet, or brain, and are hermaphrodites, as\r\nworms, leeches, snails, shell-fish, coralline insects, and sponges; which\r\npossess the simplest structure of all animals, and appear totally different\r\nfrom those already described. The simplicity of their structure, however,\r\ncan afford no argument against their having been produced from a living\r\nfilament as above contended.\r\n\r\nLast of all the various tribes of vegetables are to be enumerated amongst\r\nthe inferior orders of animals. Of these the anthers and stigmas have\r\nalready been shewn to possess some organs of sense, to be nourished by\r\nhoney, and to have the power of generation like insects, and have thence\r\nbeen announced amongst the animal kingdom in Sect. XIII. and to these must\r\nbe added the buds and bulbs which constitute the viviparous offspring of\r\nvegetation. The former I suppose to be beholden to a single living filament\r\nfor their seminal or amatorial procreation; and the latter to the same\r\ncause for their lateral or branching generation, which they possess in\r\ncommon with the polypus, tænia, and volvox; and the simplicity of which is\r\nan argument in favour of the similarity of its cause.\r\n\r\nLinnæus supposes, in the Introduction to his Natural Orders, that very few\r\nvegetables were at first created, and that their numbers were increased by\r\ntheir intermarriages, and adds, suadent hæc Creatoris leges a simplicibus\r\nad composita. Many other changes seem to have arisen in them by their\r\nperpetual contest for light and air above ground, and for food or moisture\r\nbeneath the soil. As noted in Botanic Garden, Part II. Note on Cuscuta.\r\nOther changes of vegetables from climate, or other causes, are remarked in\r\nthe Note on Curcuma in the same work. From these one might be led to\r\nimagine, that each plant at first consisted of a single bulb or flower to\r\neach root, as the gentianella and daisy; and that in the contest for air\r\nand light new buds grew on the old decaying flower stem, shooting down\r\ntheir elongated roots to the ground, and that in process of ages tall trees\r\nwere thus formed, and an individual bulb became a swarm of vegetables.\r\nOther plants, which in this contest for light and air were too slender to\r\nrise by their own strength, learned by degrees to adhere to their\r\nneighbours, either by putting forth roots like the ivy, or by tendrils like\r\nthe vine, or by spiral contortions like the honeysuckle; or by growing upon\r\nthem like the misleto, and taking nourishment from their barks; or by only\r\nlodging or adhering on them, and deriving nourishment from the air, as\r\ntillandsia.\r\n\r\nShall we then say that the vegetable living filament was originally\r\ndifferent from that of each tribe of animals above described? And that the\r\nproductive living filament of each of those tribes was different originally\r\nfrom the other? Or, as the earth and ocean were probably peopled with\r\nvegetable productions long before the existence of animals; and many\r\nfamilies of these animals long before other families of them, shall we\r\nconjecture that one and the same kind of living filaments is and has been\r\nthe cause of all organic life?\r\n\r\nThis idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world\r\naccords with the observations of some modern philosophers, who have\r\nsupposed that the continent of America has been raised out of the ocean at\r\na later period of time than the other three quarters of the globe, which\r\nthey deduce from the greater comparative heights of its mountains, and the\r\nconsequent greater coldness of its respective climates, and from the less\r\nsize and strength of its animals, as the tygers and allegators compared\r\nwith those of Asia or Africa. And lastly, from the less progress in the\r\nimprovements of the mind of its inhabitants in respect to voluntary\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the gradual formation and improvement of the animal world\r\nseems not to have been unknown to the ancient philosophers. Plato having\r\nprobably observed the reciprocal generation of inferior animals, as snails\r\nand worms, was of opinion, that mankind with all other animals were\r\noriginally hermaphrodites during the infancy of the world, and were in\r\nprocess of time separated into male and female. The breasts and teats of\r\nall male quadrupeds, to which no use can be now assigned, adds perhaps some\r\nshadow of probability to this opinion. Linnæus excepts the horse from the\r\nmale quadrupeds, who have teats; which might have shewn the earlier origin\r\nof his exigence; but Mr. J. Hunter asserts, that he has discovered the\r\nvestiges of them on his sheath, and has at the same time enriched natural\r\nhistory with a very curious fact concerning the male pigeon; at the time of\r\nhatching the eggs both the male and female pigeon undergo a great change in\r\ntheir crops; which thicken and become corrugated, and secrete a kind of\r\nmilky fluid, which coagulates, and with which alone they for a few days\r\nfeed their young, and afterwards feed them with this coagulated fluid mixed\r\nwith other food. How this resembles the breasts of female quadrupeds after\r\nthe production of their young! and how extraordinary, that the male should\r\nat this time give milk as well as the female! See Botanic Garden, Part II.\r\nNote on Curcuma.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. David Hume, in his posthumous works, places the powers of\r\ngeneration much above those of our boasted reason; and adds, that reason\r\ncan only make a machine, as a clock or a ship, but the power of generation\r\nmakes the maker of the machine; and probably from having observed, that the\r\ngreatest part of the earth has been formed out of organic recrements; as\r\nthe immense beds of limestone, chalk, marble, from the shells of fish; and\r\nthe extensive provinces of clay, sandstone, ironstone, coals, from\r\ndecomposed vegetables; all which have been first produced by generation, or\r\nby the secretions of organic life; he concludes that the world itself might\r\nhave been generated, rather than created; that is, it might have been\r\ngradually produced from very small beginnings, increasing by the activity\r\nof its inherent principles, rather than by a sudden evolution of the whole\r\nby the Almighty fire.--What a magnificent idea of the infinite power of THE\r\nGREAT ARCHITECT! THE CAUSE OF CAUSES! PARENT OF PARENTS! ENS ENTIUM!\r\n\r\nFor if we may compare infinities, it would seem to require a greater\r\ninfinity of power to cause the causes of effects, than to cause the effects\r\nthemselves. This idea is analogous to the improving excellence observable\r\nin every part of the creation; such as in the progressive increase of the\r\nsolid or habitable parts of the earth from water; and in the progressive\r\nincrease of the wisdom and happiness of its inhabitants; and is consonant\r\nto the idea of our present situation being a state of probation, which by\r\nour exertions we may improve, and are consequently responsible for our\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nV. 1. The efficient cause of the various colours of the eggs of birds, and\r\nof the air and feathers of animals, is a subject so curious, that I shall\r\nbeg to introduce it in this place. The colours of many animals seem adapted\r\nto their purposes of concealing themselves either to avoid danger, or to\r\nspring upon their prey. Thus the snake and wild cat, and leopard, are so\r\ncoloured as to resemble dark leaves and their lighter interstices; birds\r\nresemble the colour of the brown ground, or the green hedges, which they\r\nfrequent; and moths and butterflies are coloured like the flowers which\r\nthey rob of their honey. Many instances are mentioned of this kind in\r\nBotanic Garden, p. 2. Note on Rubia.\r\n\r\nThese colours have, however, in some instances another use, as the black\r\ndiverging area from the eyes of the swan; which, as his eyes are placed\r\nless prominent than those of other birds, for the convenience of putting\r\ndown his head under water, prevents the rays of light from being reflected\r\ninto his eye, and thus dazzling his sight, both in air and beneath the\r\nwater; which must have happened, if that surface had been white like the\r\nrest of his feathers.\r\n\r\nThere is a still more wonderful thing concerning these colours adapted to\r\nthe purpose of concealment; which is, that the eggs of birds are so\r\ncoloured as to resemble the colour of the adjacent objects and their\r\ninterfaces. The eggs of hedge-birds are greenish with dark spots; those of\r\ncrows and magpies, which are seen from beneath through wicker nests, are\r\nwhite with dark spots; and those of larks and partridges are russet or\r\nbrown, like their nests or situations.\r\n\r\nA thing still more astonishing is, that many animals in countries covered\r\nwith snow become white in winter, and are said to change their colour again\r\nin the warmer months, as bears, hares, and partridges. Our domesticated\r\nanimals lose their natural colours, and break into great variety, as\r\nhorses, dogs, pigeons. The final cause of these colours is easily\r\nunderstood, as they serve some purposes of the animal, but the efficient\r\ncause would seem almost beyond conjecture.\r\n\r\nFirst, the choroid coat of the eye, on which the semitransparent retina is\r\nexpanded, is of different colour in different animals; in those which feed\r\non grass it is green; from hence there would appear some connexion between\r\nthe colour of the choroid coat and of that constantly painted on the retina\r\nby the green grass. Now, when the ground becomes covered with snow, it\r\nwould seem, that that action of the retina, which is called whiteness,\r\nbeing constantly excited in the eye, may be gradually imitated by the\r\nextremities of the nerves of touch, or rete mucosum of the skin. And if it\r\nbe supposed, that the action of the retina in producing the perception of\r\nany colour consists in so disposing its own fibres or surface, as to\r\nreflect those coloured rays only, and transmit the others like\r\nsoap-bubbles; then that part of the retina, which gives us the perception\r\nof snow, must at that time be white; and that which gives us the perception\r\nof grass, must be green.\r\n\r\nThen if by the laws of imitation, as explained in Section XII. 3. 3. and\r\nXXXIX. 6. the extremities of the nerves of touch in the rete mucosum be\r\ninduced into similar action, the skin or feathers, or hair, may in like\r\nmanner so dispose their extreme fibres, as to reflect white; for it is\r\nevident, that all these parts were originally obedient to irritative\r\nmotions during their growth, and probably continue to be so; that those\r\nirritative motions are not liable in a healthy state to be succeeded by\r\nsensation; which however is no uncommon thing in their diseased state, or\r\nin their infant state, as in plica polonica, and in very young\r\npen-feathers, which are still full of blood.\r\n\r\nIt was shewn in Section XV. on the Production of Ideas, that the moving\r\norgan of sense in some circumstances resembled the object which produced\r\nthat motion. Hence it may be conceived, that the rete mucosum, which is the\r\nextremity of the nerves of touch, may by imitating the motions of the\r\nretina become coloured. And thus, like the fable of the camelion, all\r\nanimals may possess a tendency to be coloured somewhat like the colours\r\nthey most frequently inspect, and finally, that colours may be thus given\r\nto the egg-shell by the imagination of the female parent; which shell is\r\npreviously a mucous membrane, indued with irritability, without which it\r\ncould not circulate its fluids, and increase in its bulk. Nor is this more\r\nwonderful than that a single idea of imagination mould in an instant colour\r\nthe whole surface of the body of a bright scarlet, as in the blush of\r\nshame, though by a very different process. In this intricate subject\r\nnothing but loose analogical conjectures can be had, which may however lead\r\nto future discoveries; but certain it is that both the change of the colour\r\nof animals to white in the winters of snowy countries, and the spots on\r\nbirds eggs, must have some efficient cause; since the uniformity of their\r\nproduction shews it cannot arise from a fortuitous concurrence of\r\ncircumstances; and how is this efficient cause to be detected, or\r\nexplained, but from its analogy to other animal facts?\r\n\r\n2. The nutriment supplied by the female parent in viviparous animals to\r\ntheir young progeny may be divided into three kinds, corresponding with the\r\nage of the new creature. 1. The nutriment contained in the ovum as\r\npreviously prepared for the embryon in the ovary. 2. The liquor amnii\r\nprepared for the fetus in the uterus, and in which it swims; and lastly,\r\nthe milk prepared in the pectoral glands for the new born-child. There is\r\nreason to conclude that variety of changes may be produced in the new\r\nanimal from all these sources of nutriment, but particularly from the first\r\nof them..\r\n\r\nThe organs of digestion and of sanguification in adults, and afterwards\r\nthose of secretion, prepare or separate the particles proper for\r\nnourishment from other combinations of matter, or recombine them into new\r\nkinds of matter, proper to excite into action the filaments, which absorb\r\nor attract them by animal appetency. In this process we must attend not\r\nonly to the action of the living filament which receives a nutritive\r\nparticle to its bosom, but also to the kind of particle, in respect to\r\nform, or size, or colour, or hardness, which is thus previously prepared\r\nfor it by digestion, sanguification, and secretion. Now as the first\r\nfilament of entity cannot be furnished with the preparative organs above\r\nmentioned, the nutritive particles, which are at first to be received by\r\nit, are prepared by the mother; and deposited in the ovum ready for its\r\nreception. These nutritive particles must be supposed to differ in some\r\nrespects, when thus prepared by different animals. They may differ in size,\r\nsolidity, colour, and form; and yet may be sufficiently congenial to the\r\nliving filament, to which they are applied, as to excite its activity by\r\ntheir stimulus, and its animal appetency to receive them, and to combine\r\nthem with itself into organization.\r\n\r\nBy this first nutriment thus prepared for the embryon is not meant the\r\nliquor amnii, which is produced afterwards, nor the larger exterior parts\r\nof the white of the egg; but the fluid prepared, I suppose, in the ovary of\r\nviviparous animals, and that which immediately surrounds the cicatricula of\r\nan impregnated egg, and is visible to the eye in a boiled one.\r\n\r\nNow these ultimate particles of animal matter prepared by the glands of the\r\nmother may be supposed to resemble the similar ultimate particles, which\r\nwere prepared for her own nourishment; that is, to the ultimate particles\r\nof which her own organization consists. And that hence when these become\r\ncombined with a new embryon, which in its early state is not furnished with\r\nstomach, or glands, to alter them; that new embryon will bear some\r\nresemblance to the mother.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the origin of the compound forms of mules, which evidently\r\npartake of both parents, but principally of the male parent. In this\r\nproduction of chimeras the antients seem to have indulged their fancies,\r\nwhence the sphinxes, griffins, dragons, centaurs, and minotaurs, which are\r\nvanished from modern credulity.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, that in these unnatural conjunctions, when the nutriment\r\ndeposited by the female was so ill adapted to stimulate the living filament\r\nderived from the male into action, and to be received; or embraced by it,\r\nand combined with it into organization, as not to produce the organs\r\nnecessary to life, as the brain, or heart, or stomach, that no mule was\r\nproduced. Where all the parts necessary to life in these compound animals\r\nwere formed sufficiently perfect, except the parts of generation, those\r\nanimals were produced which are now called mules.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the organs of sexual generation, in contradistinction to\r\nthat by lateral buds, in vegetables, and in some animals, as the polypus,\r\nthe tænia, and the volvox, seems the chef d'oeuvre, the master-piece of\r\nnature; as appears from many flying insects, as in moths and butterflies,\r\nwho seem to undergo a general change of their forms solely for the purpose\r\nof sexual reproduction, and in all other animals this organ is not complete\r\ntill the maturity of the creature. Whence it happens that, in the\r\ncopulation of animals of different species, the parts necessary to life are\r\nfrequently completely formed; but those for the purpose of generation are\r\ndefective, as requiring a nicer organization; or more exact coincidence of\r\nthe particles of nutriment to the irritabilities or appetencies of the\r\noriginal living filament. Whereas those mules, where all the parts could be\r\nperfectly formed, may have been produced in early periods of time, and may\r\nhave added to the numbers of our various species of animals, as before\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nAs this production of mules is a constant effect from the conjunction of\r\ndifferent species of animals, those between the horse and the female ass\r\nalways resembling the horse more than the ass; and those, on the contrary,\r\nbetween the male ass and the mare, always resembling the ass more than the\r\nmare; it cannot be ascribed to the imagination of the male animal which\r\ncannot be supposed to operate so uniformly; but to the form of the first\r\nnutritive particles, and to their peculiar stimulus exciting the living\r\nfilament to select and combine them with itself. There is a similar\r\nuniformity of effect in respect to the colour of the progeny produced\r\nbetween a white man, and a black woman, which, if I am well informed, is\r\nalways of the mulatto kind, or a mixture of the two; which may perhaps be\r\nimputed to the peculiar form of the particles of nutriment supplied to the\r\nembryon by the mother at the early period of its existence, and their\r\npeculiar stimulus; as this effect, like that of the mule progeny above\r\ntreated of, is uniform and consistent, and cannot therefore be ascribed to\r\nthe imagination of either of the parents.\r\n\r\nDr. Thunberg observes, in his Journey to the Cape of Good Hope, that there\r\nare some families, which have descended from blacks in the female line for\r\nthree generations. The first generation proceeding from an European, who\r\nmarried a tawny slave, remains tawny, but approaches to a white complexion;\r\nbut the children of the third generation, mixed with Europeans, become\r\nquite white, and are often remarkably beautiful. V. i. p. 112.\r\n\r\nWhen the embryon has produced a placenta, and furnished itself with vessels\r\nfor selection of nutritious particles, and for oxygenation of them, no\r\ngreat change in its form or colour is likely to be produced by the\r\nparticles of sustenance it now takes from the fluid, in which it is\r\nimmersed; because it has now acquired organs to alter or new combine them.\r\nHence it continues to grow, whether this fluid, in which it swims, be\r\nformed by the uterus or by any other cavity of the body, as in\r\nextra-uterine gestation; and which would seem to be produced by the\r\nstimulus of the fetus on the sides of the cavity, where it is found, as\r\nmentioned before. And thirdly, there is still less reason to expect any\r\nunnatural change to happen to the child after its birth from the difference\r\nof the milk it now takes; because it has acquired a stomach, and lungs, and\r\nglands, of sufficient power to decompose and recombine the milk; and thus\r\nto prepare from it the various kinds of nutritious particles, which the\r\nappetencies of the various fibrils or nerves may require.\r\n\r\nFrom all this reasoning I would conclude, that though the imagination of\r\nthe female may be supposed to affect the embryon by producing a difference\r\nin its early nutriment; yet that no such power can affect it after it has\r\nobtained a placenta, and other organs; which may select or change the food,\r\nwhich is presented to it either in the liquor amnii, or in the milk. Now as\r\nthe eggs in pullets, like the seeds in vegetables, are produced gradually,\r\nlong before they are impregnated, it does not appear how any sudden effect\r\nof imagination of the mother at the time of impregnation can produce any\r\nconsiderable change in the nutriment already thus laid up for the expected\r\nor desired embryon. And that hence any changes of the embryon, except those\r\nuniform ones in the production of mules and mulattoes, more probably depend\r\non the imagination of the male parent. At the same time it seems manifest,\r\nthat those monstrous births, which consist in some deficiencies only, or\r\nsome redundancies of parts, originate from the deficiency or redundance of\r\nthe first nutriment prepared in the ovary, or in the part of the egg\r\nimmediately surrounding the cicatricula, as described above; and which\r\ncontinues some time to excite the first living filament into action, after\r\nthe simple animal is completed; or ceases to excite it, before the complete\r\nform is accomplished. The former of these circumstances is evinced by the\r\neggs with double yolks, which frequently happen to our domesticated\r\npoultry, and which, I believe, are so formed before impregnation, but which\r\nwould be well worth attending to, both before and after impregnation; as it\r\nis probable, something valuable on this subject might be learnt from them.\r\nThe latter circumstance, or that of deficiency of original nutriment, may\r\nbe deduced from reverse analogy.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, other kinds of monstrous births, which neither depend\r\non deficiency of parts, or supernumerary ones; nor are owing to the\r\nconjunction of animals of different species; but which appear to be new\r\nconformations, or new dispositions of parts in respect to each other, and\r\nwhich, like the variation of colours and forms of our domesticated animals,\r\nand probably the sexual parts of all animals, may depend on the imagination\r\nof the male parent, which we now come to consider.\r\n\r\nVI. 1. The nice actions of the extremities of our various glands are\r\nexhibited in their various productions, which are believed to be made by\r\nthe gland, and not previously to exist as such in the blood.\r\n\r\nThus the glands, which constitute the liver, make bile; those of the\r\nstomach make gastric acid; those beneath the jaw, saliva; those of the\r\nears, ear-wax; and the like. Every kind of gland must possess a peculiar\r\nirritability, and probably a sensibility, at the early state of its\r\nexistence; and must be furnished with a nerve of sense, or of motion, to\r\nperceive, and to select, and to combine the particles, which compose the\r\nfluid it secretes. And this nerve of sense which perceives the different\r\narticles which compose the blood, must at least be conceived to be as fine\r\nand subtile an organ, as the optic or auditory nerve, which perceive light\r\nor sound. See Sect. XIV. 9.\r\n\r\nBut in nothing is this nice action of the extremities of the blood-vessels\r\nso wonderful, as in the production of contagious matter. A small drop of\r\nvariolous contagion diffused in the blood, or perhaps only by being\r\ninserted beneath the cuticle, after a time, (as about a quarter of a\r\nlunation,) excites the extreme vessels of the skin into certain motions,\r\nwhich produce a similar contagious material, filling with it a thousand\r\npustules. So that by irritation, or by sensation in consequence of\r\nirritation, or by association of motions, a material is formed by the\r\nextremities of certain cutaneous vessels, exactly similar to the\r\nstimulating material, which caused the irritation, or consequent sensation,\r\nor association.\r\n\r\nMany glands of the body have their motions, and in consequence their\r\nsecreted fluids, affected by pleasurable or painful ideas, since they are\r\nin many instances influenced by sensitive associations, as well as by the\r\nirritations of the particles of the passing blood. Thus the idea of meat,\r\nexcited in the minds of hungry dogs, by their sense of vision, or of smell,\r\nincreases the discharge of saliva, both in quantity and viscidity; as is\r\nseen in its hanging down in threads from their mouths, as they stand round\r\na dinner-table. The sensations of pleasure, or of pain, of peculiar kinds,\r\nexcite in the same manner a great discharge of tears; which appear also to\r\nbe more saline at the time of their secretion, from their inflaming the\r\neyes and eye-lids. The paleness from fear, and the blush of shame, and of\r\njoy, are other instances of the effects of painful, or pleasurable\r\nsensations, on the extremities of the arterial system.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that the pleasurable sensation excited in the stomach by\r\nfood, as well as its irritation, contributes to excite into action the\r\ngastric glands, and to produce a greater secretion of their fluids. The\r\nsame probably occurs in the secretion of bile; that is, that the\r\npleasurable sensation excited in the stomach, affects this secretion by\r\nsensitive association, as well as by irritative association.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly it would seem, that all the glands in the body have their\r\nsecreted fluids affected, in quantity and quality, by the pleasurable or\r\npainful sensations, which produce or accompany those secretions. And that\r\nthe pleasurable sensations arising from these secretions may constitute the\r\nunnamed pleasure of exigence, which is contrary to what is meant by tedium\r\nvitæ, or ennui; and by which we sometimes feel ourselves happy, without\r\nbeing able to ascribe it to any mental cause, as after an agreeable meal,\r\nor in the beginning of intoxication.\r\n\r\nNow it would appear, that no secretion or excretion of fluid is attended\r\nwith so much agreeable sensation, as that of the semen; and it would thence\r\nfollow, that the glands, which perform this secretion, are more likely to\r\nbe much affected by their catenations with pleasurable sensations. This\r\ncircumstance is certain, that much more of this fluid is produced in a\r\ngiven time, when the object of its exclusion is agreeable to the mind.\r\n\r\n2. A forceable argument, which shews the necessity of pleasurable sensation\r\nto copulation, is, that the act cannot be performed without it; it is\r\neasily interrupted by the pain of fear or bashfulness; and no efforts of\r\nvolition or of irritation can effect this process, except such as induce\r\npleasurable ideas or sensations. See Sect. XXXIII. 1. 1.\r\n\r\nA curious analogical circumstance attending hermaphrodite insects, as\r\nsnails and worms, still further illustrates this theory; if the snail or\r\nworm could have impregnated itself, there might have been a saving of a\r\nlarge male apparatus; but as this is not so ordered by nature, but each\r\nsnail and worm reciprocally receives and gives impregnation, it appears,\r\nthat a pleasurable excitation seems also to have been required.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful circumstance of many insects being hermaphrodites, and at\r\nthe same time not having power to impregnate themselves, is attended to by\r\nDr. Lister, in his Exercitationes Anatom. de Limacibus, p. 145; who,\r\namongst many other final causes, which he adduces to account for it, adds,\r\nut tam tristibus et frigidis animalibus majori cum voluptate perficiatur\r\nvenus.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another final cause, to which this circumstance may be\r\nimputed: it was observed above, that vegetable buds and bulbs, which are\r\nproduced without a mother, are always exact resemblances of their parent;\r\nas appears in grafting fruit-trees, and in the flower-buds of the dioiceous\r\nplants, which are always of the same sex on the same tree; hence those\r\nhermaphrodite insects, if they could have produced young without a mother,\r\nwould not have been, capable of that change or improvement, which is seen\r\nin all other animals, and in those vegetables, which are procreated by the\r\nmale embryon received and nourished by the female. And it is hence\r\nprobable, that if vegetables could only have been produced by buds and\r\nbulbs, and not by sexual generation, that there would not at this time have\r\nexisted one thousandth part of their present number of species; which have\r\nprobably been originally mule-productions; nor could any kind of\r\nimprovement or change have happened to them, except by the difference of\r\nsoil or climate.\r\n\r\n3. I conclude, that the imagination of the male at the time of copulation,\r\nor at the time of the secretion of the semen, may so affect this secretion\r\nby irritative or sensitive association, as described in No. 5. 1. of this\r\nsection, as to cause the production of similarity of form and of features,\r\nwith the distinction of sex; as the motions of the chissel of the turner\r\nimitate or correspond with those of the ideas of the artist. It is not here\r\nto be understood, that the first living fibre, which is to form an animal,\r\nis produced with any similarity of form to the future animal; but with\r\npropensities, or appetences, which shall produce by accretion of parts the\r\nsimilarity of form, feature, or sex, corresponding to the imagination of\r\nthe father.\r\n\r\nOur ideas are movements of the nerves of sense, as of the optic nerve in\r\nrecollecting visible ideas, suppose of a triangular piece of ivory. The\r\nfine moving fibres of the retina act in a manner to which I give the name\r\nof white; and this action is confined to a defined part of it; to which\r\nfigure I give the name of triangle. And it is a preceding pleasurable\r\nsensation existing in my mind, which occasions me to produce this\r\nparticular motion of the retina, when no triangle is present. Now it is\r\nprobable, that the acting fibres of the ultimate terminations of the\r\nsecreting apertures of the vessels of the testes, are as fine as those of\r\nthe retina; and that they are liable to be thrown into that peculiar\r\naction, which marks the sex of the secreted embryon, by sympathy with the\r\npleasurable motions of the nerves of vision or of touch; that is, with\r\ncertain ideas of imagination. From hence it would appear, that the world\r\nhas long been mistaken in ascribing great power to the imagination of the\r\nfemale, whereas from this account of it, the real power of imagination, in\r\nthe act of generation, belongs solely to the male. See Sect. XII. 3. 3.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to this theory, that a man may be supposed to have in\r\nhis mind, the idea of the form and features of the female, rather than his\r\nown, and therefore there should be a greater number of female births. On\r\nthe contrary, the general idea of our own form occurs to every one almost\r\nperpetually, and is termed consciousness of our existence, and thus may\r\neffect, that the number of males surpasses that of females. See Sect. XV.\r\n3. 4. and XVIII. 13. And what further confirms this idea is, that the male\r\nchildren most frequently resemble the father in form, or feature, as well\r\nas in sex; and the female most frequently resemble the mother, in feature,\r\nand form, as well as in sex.\r\n\r\nIt may again be objected, if a female child sometimes resembles the father,\r\nand a male child the mother, the ideas of the father, at the time of\r\nprocreation, must suddenly change from himself to the mother, at the very\r\ninstant, when the embryon is secreted or formed. This difficulty ceases\r\nwhen we consider, that it is as easy to form an idea of feminine features\r\nwith male organs of reproduction, or of male features with female ones, as\r\nthe contrary; as we conceive the idea of a sphinx or mermaid as easily and\r\nas distinctly as of a woman. Add to this, that at the time of procreation\r\nthe idea of the male organs, and of the female features, are often both\r\nexcited at the same time, by contact, or by vision.\r\n\r\nI ask, in my turn, is the sex of the embryon produced by accident?\r\nCertainly whatever is produced has a cause; but when this cause is too\r\nminute for our comprehension, the effect is said in common language to\r\nhappen by chance, as in throwing a certain number on dice. Now what cause\r\ncan occasionally produce the male or female character of the embryon, but\r\nthe peculiar actions of those glands, which form the embryon? And what can\r\ninfluence or govern these actions of the gland, but its associations or\r\ncatenations with other sensitive motions? Nor is this more extraordinary,\r\nthan that the catenations of irritative motions with the apparent\r\nvibrations of objects at sea should produce sickness of the stomach; or\r\nthat a nauseous story should occasion vomiting.\r\n\r\n4. An argument, which evinces the effect of imagination on the first\r\nrudiment of the embryon, may be deduced from the production of some\r\npeculiar monsters. Such, for instance, as those which have two heads joined\r\nto one body, and those which have two bodies joined to one head; of which\r\nfrequent examples occur amongst our domesticated quadrupeds, and poultry.\r\nIt is absurd to suppose, that such forms could exist in primordial germs,\r\nas explained in No. IV. 4. of this section. Nor is it possible, that such\r\ndeformities could be produced by the growth of two embryons, or living\r\nfilaments; which should afterwards adhere together; as the head and tail\r\npart of different polypi are said to do (Blumenbach on Generation, Cadel,\r\nLondon); since in that case one embryon, or living filament, must have\r\nbegun to form one part first, and the other another part first. But such\r\nmonstrous conformations become less difficult to comprehend, when they are\r\nconsidered as an effect of the imagination, as before explained, on the\r\nliving filament at the time of its secretion; and that such duplicature of\r\nlimbs were produced by accretion of new parts, in consequence of\r\npropensities, or animal appetencies thus acquired from the male parent.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I can conceive, if a turkey-cock should behold a rabbit, or a\r\nfrog, at the time of procreation, that it might happen, that a forcible or\r\neven a pleasurable idea of the form of a quadruped might so occupy his\r\nimagination, as to cause a tendency in the nascent filament to resemble\r\nsuch a form, by the apposition of a duplicature of limbs. Experiments on\r\nthe production of mules and monsters would be worthy the attention of a\r\nSpallanzani, and might throw much light upon this subject, which at present\r\nmust be explained by conjectural analogies.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful effect of imagination, both in the male and female parent, is\r\nshewn in the production of a kind of milk in the crops both of the male and\r\nfemale pigeons after the birth of their young, as observed by Mr. Hunter,\r\nand mentioned before. To this should be added, that there are some\r\ninstances of men having had milk secreted in their breasts, and who have\r\ngiven suck to children, as recorded by Mr. Buffon. This effect of\r\nimagination, of both the male and female parent, seems to have been\r\nattended to in very early times; Jacob is said not only to have placed rods\r\nof trees, in part stripped of their bark, so as to appear spotted, but also\r\nto have placed spotted lambs before the flocks, at the time of their\r\ncopulation. Genesis, chap. xxx. verse 40.\r\n\r\n5. In respect to the imagination of the mother, it is difficult to\r\ncomprehend, how this can produce any alteration in the fetus, except by\r\naffecting the nutriment laid up for its first reception, as described in\r\nNo. V. 2. of this section, or by affecting the nourishment or oxygenation\r\nwith which she supplies it afterwards. Perpetual anxiety may probably\r\naffect the secretion of the liquor amnii into the uterus, as it enfeebles\r\nthe whole system; and sudden fear is a frequent cause of miscarriage; for\r\nfear, contrary to joy, decreases for a time the action of the extremities\r\nof the arterial system; hence sudden paleness succeeds, and a shrinking or\r\ncontraction of the vessels of the skin, and other membranes. By this\r\ncircumstance, I imagine, the terminations of the placental vessels are\r\ndetached from their adhesions, or insertions, into the membrane of the\r\nuterus; and the death of the child succeeds, and consequent miscarriage.\r\n\r\nOf this I recollect a remarkable instance, which could be ascribed to no\r\nother cause, and which I shall therefore relate in few words. A healthy\r\nyoung woman, about twenty years of age, had been about five months\r\npregnant, and going down into her cellar to draw some beer, was frighted by\r\na servant boy starting up from behind the barrel, where he had concealed\r\nhimself with design to alarm the maid-servant, for whom he mistook his\r\nmistress. She came with difficulty up stairs, began to flood immediately,\r\nand miscarried in a few hours. She has since borne several children, nor\r\never had any tendency to miscarry of any of them.\r\n\r\n6. In respect to the power of the imagination of the male over the form,\r\ncolour, and sex of the progeny, the following instances have fallen under\r\nmy observation, and may perhaps be found not very unfrequent, if they were\r\nmore attended to. I am acquainted with a gentleman, who has one child with\r\ndark hair and eyes, though his lady and himself have light hair and eyes;\r\nand their other four children are like their parents. On observing this\r\ndissimilarity of one child to the others he assured me, that he believed it\r\nwas his own imagination, that produced the difference; and related to me\r\nthe following story. He said, that when his lady lay in of her third child,\r\nhe became attached to a daughter of one of his inferior tenants, and\r\noffered her a bribe for her favours in vain; and afterwards a greater\r\nbribe, and was equally unsuccessful; that the form of this girl dwelt much\r\nin his mind for some weeks, and that the next child, which was the\r\ndark-ey'd young lady above mentioned, was exceedingly like, in both\r\nfeatures and colour, to the young woman who refused his addresses.\r\n\r\nTo this instance I must add, that I have known two families, in which, on\r\naccount of an intailed estate in expectation, a male heir was most eagerly\r\ndesired by the father; and on the contrary, girls were produced to the\r\nseventh in one, and to the ninth in another; and then they had each of them\r\na son. I conclude, that the great desire of a male heir by the father\r\nproduced rather a disagreeable than an agreeable sensation; and that his\r\nideas dwelt more on the fear of generating a female, than on the\r\npleasurable sensations or ideas of his own male form or organs at the time\r\nof copulation, or of the secretion of the semen; and that hence the idea of\r\nthe female character was more present to his mind than that of the male\r\none; till at length in despair of generating a male these ideas ceased, and\r\nthose of the male character presided at the genial hour.\r\n\r\n7. Hence I conclude, that the act of generation cannot exist without being\r\naccompanied with ideas, and that a man must have at that time either a\r\ngeneral idea of his own male form, or of the form of his male organs; or an\r\nidea of the female form, or of her organs; and that this marks the sex, and\r\nthe peculiar resemblances of the child to either parent. From whence it\r\nwould appear, that the phalli, which were hung round the necks of the Roman\r\nladies, or worn in their hair, might have effect in producing a greater\r\nproportion of male children; and that the calipædia, or art of begetting\r\nbeautiful children, and of procreating either males or females, may be\r\ntaught by affecting the imagination of the male-parent; that is, by the\r\nfine extremities of the seminal glands, imitating the actions of the organs\r\nof sense either of sight or touch. But the manner of accomplishing this\r\ncannot be unfolded with sufficient delicacy for the public eye; but may be\r\nworth the attention of those, who are seriously interested in the\r\nprocreation of a male or female child.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\nVII. 1. A certain quantity of nutritive particles are produced by the\r\nfemale parent before impregnation, which require no further digestion,\r\nsecretion, or oxygenation. Such are seen in the unimpregnated eggs of\r\nbirds, and in the unimpregnated seed-vessels of vegetables.\r\n\r\n2. A living filament is produced by the male, which being inserted amidst\r\nthese first nutritive particles, is stimulated into action by them; and in\r\nconsequence of this action, some of the nutritive particles are embraced,\r\nand added to the original living filament; in the same manner as common\r\nnutrition is performed in the adult animal.\r\n\r\n3. Then this new organization, or additional part, becomes stimulated by\r\nthe nutritive particles in its vicinity, and sensation is now superadded to\r\nirritation; and other particles are in consequence embraced, and added to\r\nthe living filament; as is seen in the new granulations of flesh in ulcers.\r\n\r\nBy the power of association, or by irritation, the parts already produced\r\ncontinue their motions, and new ones are added by sensation, as above\r\nmentioned; and lastly by volition, which last sensorial power is proved to\r\nexist in the fetus in its maturer age, because it has evidently periods of\r\nactivity and of sleeping; which last is another word for a temporary\r\nsuspension of volition.\r\n\r\nThe original living filament may be conceived to possess a power of\r\nrepulsing the particles applied to certain parts of it, as well as of\r\nembracing others, which stimulate other parts of it; as these powers exist\r\nin different parts of the mature animal; thus the mouth of every gland\r\nembraces the particles or fluid, which suits its appetency; and its\r\nexcretory duct repulses those particles, which are disagreeable to it.\r\n\r\n4. Thus the outline or miniature of the new animal is produced gradually,\r\nbut in no great length of time; because the original nutritive particles\r\nrequire no previous preparation by digestion, secretion, and oxygenation:\r\nbut require simply the selection and apposition, which is performed by the\r\nliving filament. Mr. Blumenbach says, that he possesses a human fetus of\r\nonly five weeks old, which is the size of a common bee, and has all the\r\nfeatures of the face, every finger, and every toe, complete; and in which\r\nthe organs of generation are distinctly seen. P. 76. In another fetus,\r\nwhose head was not larger than a pea, the whole of the basis of the skull\r\nwith all its depressions, apertures, and processes, were marked in the most\r\nsharp and distinct manner, though without any ossification. Ib.\r\n\r\n5. In some cases by the nutriment originally deposited by the mother the\r\nfilament acquires parts not exactly similar to those of the father, as in\r\nthe production of mules and mulattoes. In other cases, the deficiency of\r\nthis original nutriment causes deficiencies of the extreme parts of the\r\nfetus, which are last formed, as the fingers, toes, lips. In other cases, a\r\nduplicature of limbs are caused by the superabundance of this original\r\nnutritive fluid, as in the double yolks of eggs, and the chickens from them\r\nwith four legs and four wings. But the production of other monsters, as\r\nthose with two heads, or with parts placed in wrong situations, seems to\r\narise from the imagination of the father being in some manner imitated by\r\nthe extreme vessels of the seminal glands; as the colours of the spots on\r\neggs, and the change of the colour of the hair and feathers of animals by\r\ndomestication, may be caused in the same manner by the imagination of the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n6. The living filament is a part of the father, and has therefore certain\r\npropensities, or appetencies, which belong to him; which may have been\r\ngradually acquired during a million of generations, even from the infancy\r\nof the habitable earth; and which now possesses such properties, as would\r\nrender, by the apposition of nutritious particles, the new fetus exactly\r\nsimilar to the father; as occurs in the buds and bulbs of vegetables, and\r\nin the polypus, and tænia or tape-worm. But as the first nutriment is\r\nsupplied by the mother, and therefore resembles such nutritive particles,\r\nas have been used for her own nutriment or growth, the progeny takes in\r\npart of the likeness of the mother.\r\n\r\nOther similarity of the excitability, or of the form of the male parent,\r\nsuch as the broad or narrow shoulders, or such as constitute certain\r\nhereditary diseases, as scrophula, epilepsy, insanity, have their origin\r\nproduced in one or perhaps two generations; as in the progeny of those who\r\ndrink much vinous spirits; and those hereditary propensities cease again,\r\nas I have observed, if one or two sober generations succeed; otherwise the\r\nfamily becomes extinct.\r\n\r\nThis living filament from the father is also liable to have its\r\npropensities, or appetencies, altered at the time of its production by the\r\nimagination of the male parent; the extremities of the seminal glands\r\nimitating the motions of the organs of sense; and thus the sex of the\r\nembryon is produced; which may be thus made a male or a female by affecting\r\nthe imagination of the father at the time of impregnation. See Sect. XXXIX.\r\n6. 3. and 7.\r\n\r\n7. After the fetus is thus completely formed together with its umbilical\r\nvessels and placenta, it is now supplied with a different kind of food, as\r\nappears by the difference of consistency of the different parts of the\r\nwhite of the egg, and of the liquor amnii, for it has now acquired organs\r\nfor digestion or secretion, and for oxygenation, though they are as yet\r\nfeeble; which can in some degree change, as well as select, the nutritive\r\nparticles, which are now presented to it. But may yet be affected by the\r\ndeficiency of the quantity of nutrition supplied by the mother, or by the\r\ndegree of oxygenation supplied to its placenta by the maternal blood.\r\n\r\nThe augmentation of the complete fetus by additional particles of nutriment\r\nis not accomplished by distention only, but by apposition to every part\r\nboth external and internal; each of which acquires by animal appetencies\r\nthe new addition of the particles which it wants. And hence the enlarged\r\nparts are kept similar to their prototypes, and may be said to be extended;\r\nbut their extension must be conceived only as a necessary consequence of\r\nthe enlargement of all their parts by apposition of new particles.\r\n\r\nHence the new apposition of parts is not produced by capillary attraction,\r\nbecause the whole is extended; whereas capillary attraction would rather\r\ntend to bring the sides of flexible tubes together, and not to distend\r\nthem. Nor is it produced by chemical affinities, for then a solution of\r\ncontinuity would succeed, as when sugar is dissolved in water; but it is\r\nproduced by an animal process, which is the consequence of irritation, or\r\nsensation; and which may be termed animal appetency.\r\n\r\nThis is further evinced from experiments, which have been instituted to\r\nshew, that a living muscle of an animal body requires greater force to\r\nbreak it, than a similar muscle of a dead body. Which evinces, that besides\r\nthe attraction of cohesion, which all matter possesses, and besides the\r\nchemical attractions of affinities, which hold many bodies together, there\r\nis an animal adhesion, which adds vigour to these common laws of the\r\ninanimate world.\r\n\r\n8. At the nativity of the child it deposits the placenta or gills, and by\r\nexpanding its lungs acquires more plentiful oxygenation from the currents\r\nof air, which it must now continue perpetually to respire to the end of its\r\nlife; as it now quits the liquid element, in which it was produced, and\r\nlike the tadpole, when it changes into a frog, becomes an aerial animal.\r\n\r\n9. As the habitable parts of the earth have been, and continue to be,\r\nperpetually increasing by the production of sea-shells and corallines, and\r\nby the recrements of other animals, and vegetables; so from the beginning\r\nof the existence of this terraqueous globe, the animals, which inhabit it,\r\nhave constantly improved, and are still in a state of progressive\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the gradual generation of all things seems to have been as\r\nfamiliar to the ancient philosophers as to the modern ones; and to have\r\ngiven rise to the beautiful hieroglyphic figure of the [Greek: proton ôon],\r\nor first great egg, produced by NIGHT, that is, whose origin is involved in\r\nobscurity, and animated by [Greek: eros], that is, by DIVINE LOVE; from\r\nwhence proceeded all things which exist.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nVIII. 1. Cause and effect may be considered as the progression, or\r\nsuccessive motions, of the parts of the great system of Nature. The state\r\nof things at this moment is the effect of the state of things, which\r\nexisted in the preceding moment; and the cause of the state of things,\r\nwhich shall exist in the next moment.\r\n\r\nThese causes and effects may be more easily comprehended, if motion be\r\nconsidered as a change of the figure of a group of bodies, as proposed in\r\nSect. XIV. 2. 2. inasmuch as our ideas of visible or tangible objects are\r\nmore distinct, than our abstracted ideas of their motions. Now the change\r\nof the configuration of the system of nature at this moment must be an\r\neffect of the preceding configuration, for a change of configuration cannot\r\nexist without a previous configuration; and the proximate cause of every\r\neffect must immediately precede that effect. For example, a moving ivory\r\nball could not proceed onwards, unless it had previously began to proceed;\r\nor unless an impulse had been previously given it; which previous motion or\r\nimpulse constitutes a part of the last situation of things.\r\n\r\nAs the effects produced in this moment of time become causes in the next,\r\nwe may consider the progressive motions of objects as a chain of causes\r\nonly; whose first link proceeded from the great Creator, and which have\r\nexisted from the beginning of the created universe, and are perpetually\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\n2. These causes may be conveniently divided into two kinds, efficient and\r\ninert causes, according with the two kinds of entity supposed to exist in\r\nthe natural world, which may be termed matter and spirit, as proposed in\r\nSect. I. and further treated of in Sect. XIV. The efficient causes of\r\nmotion, or new configuration, consist either of the principle of general\r\ngravitation, which actuates the sun and planets; or of the principle of\r\nparticular gravitation, as in electricity, magnetism, heat; or of the\r\nprinciple of chemical affinity, as in combustion, fermentation,\r\ncombination; or of the principle of organic life, as in the contraction of\r\nvegetable and animal fibres. The inert causes of motion, or new\r\nconfiguration, consist of the parts of matter, which are introduced within\r\nthe spheres of activity of the principles above described. Thus, when an\r\napple falls on the ground, the principle of gravitation is the efficient\r\ncause, and the matter of the apple the inert cause. If a bar of iron be\r\napproximated to a magnet, it may be termed the inert cause of the motion,\r\nwhich brings these two bodies into contact; while the magnetic principle\r\nmay be termed the efficient cause. In the same manner the fibres, which\r\nconstitute the retina, may be called the inert cause of the motions of that\r\norgan in vision, while the sensorial power may be termed the efficient\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n3. Another more common distribution of the perpetual chain of causes and\r\neffects, which constitute the motions, or changing configurations, of the\r\nnatural world, is into active and passive. Thus, if a ball in motion\r\nimpinges against another ball at rest, and communicates its motion to it,\r\nthe former ball is said to act, and the latter to be acted upon. In this\r\nsense of the words a magnet is said to attract iron; and the prick of a\r\nspur to stimulate a horse into exertion; so that in this view of the works\r\nof nature all things may be said either simply to exist, or to exist as\r\ncauses, or to exist as effects; that is, to exist either in an active or\r\npassive state.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of objects, and their motions, or changes of position,\r\nhas been found so convenient for the purposes of common life, that on this\r\nfoundation rests the whole construction or theory of language. The names of\r\nthe things themselves are termed by grammarians Nouns, and their modes of\r\nexistence are termed Verbs. The nouns are divided into substantives, which\r\ndenote the principal things spoken of; and into adjectives, which denote\r\nsome circumstances, or less kinds of things, belonging to the former. The\r\nverbs are divided into three kinds, such as denote the existence of things\r\nsimply, as, to be; or their existence in an active state, as, to eat; or\r\ntheir existence in a passive state, as, to be eaten. Whence it appears,\r\nthat all languages consist only of nouns and verbs, with their\r\nabbreviations for the greater expedition of communicating our thoughts; as\r\nexplained in the ingenious work of Mr. Horne Tooke, who has unfolded by a\r\nsingle flash of light the whole theory of language, which had so long lain\r\nburied beneath the learned lumber of the schools. Diversions of Purley.\r\nJohnson. London.\r\n\r\n4. A third division of causes has been into proximate and remote; these\r\nhave been much spoken of by the writers on medical subjects, but without\r\nsufficient precision. If to proximate and remote causes we add proximate\r\nand remote effects, we shall include four links of the perpetual chain of\r\ncausation; which will be more convenient for the discussion of many\r\nphilosophical subjects.\r\n\r\nThus if a particle of chyle be applied to the mouth of a lacteal vessel, it\r\nmay be termed the remote cause of the motions of the fibres, which compose\r\nthe mouth of that lacteal vessel; the sensorial power is the proximate\r\ncause; the contraction of the fibres of the mouth of the vessel is the\r\nproximate effect; and their embracing the particle of chyle is the remote\r\neffect; and these four links of causation constitute absorption.\r\n\r\nThus when we attend to the rising sun, first the yellow rays of light\r\nstimulate the sensorial power residing in the extremities of the optic\r\nnerve, this is the remote cause. 2. The sensorial power is excited into a\r\nstate of activity, this is the proximate cause. 3. The fibrous extremities\r\nof the optic nerve are contracted, this is the proximate effect. 4. A\r\npleasurable or painful sensation is produced in consequence of the\r\ncontraction of these fibres of the optic nerve, this is the remote effect;\r\nand these four links of the chain of causation constitute the sensitive\r\nidea, or what is commonly termed the sensation of the rising sun.\r\n\r\n5. Other causes have been announced by medical writers under the names of\r\ncausa procatarctica, and causa proegumina, and causa sine quâ non. All\r\nwhich are links more or less distant of the chain of remote causes.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added the final cause, so called by many authors, which\r\nmeans the motive, for the accomplishment of which the preceding chain of\r\ncauses was put into action. The idea of a final cause, therefore, includes\r\nthat of a rational mind, which employs means to effect its purposes; thus\r\nthe desire of preserving himself from the pain of cold, which he has\r\nfrequently experienced, induces the savage to construct his hut; the fixing\r\nstakes into the ground for walls, branches of trees for rafters, and turf\r\nfor a cover, are a series of successive voluntary exertions; which are so\r\nmany means to produce a certain effect. This effect of preserving himself\r\nfrom cold, is termed the final cause; the construction of the hut is the\r\nremote effect; the action of the muscular fibres of the man, is the\r\nproximate effect; the volition, or activity of desire to preserve himself\r\nfrom cold, is the proximate cause; and the pain of cold, which excited that\r\ndesire, is the remote cause.\r\n\r\n6. This perpetual chain of causes and effects, whose first link is rivetted\r\nto the throne of GOD, divides itself into innumerable diverging branches,\r\nwhich, like the nerves arising from the brain, permeate the most minute and\r\nmost remote extremities of the system, diffusing motion and sensation to\r\nthe whole. As every cause is superior in power to the effect, which it has\r\nproduced, so our idea of the power of the Almighty Creator becomes more\r\nelevated and sublime, as we trace the operations of nature from cause to\r\ncause, climbing up the links of these chains of being, till we ascend to\r\nthe Great Source of all things.\r\n\r\nHence the modern discoveries in chemistry and in geology, by having traced\r\nthe causes of the combinations of bodies to remoter origins, as well as\r\nthose in astronomy, which dignify the present age, contribute to enlarge\r\nand amplify our ideas of the power of the Great First Cause. And had those\r\nancient philosophers, who contended that the world was formed from atoms,\r\nascribed their combinations to certain immutable properties received from\r\nthe hand of the Creator, such as general gravitation, chemical affinity, or\r\nanimal appetency, instead of ascribing them to a blind chance; the doctrine\r\nof atoms, as constituting or composing the material world by the variety of\r\ntheir combinations, so far from leading the mind to atheism, would\r\nstrengthen the demonstration of the existence of a Deity, as the first\r\ncause of all things; because the analogy resulting from our perpetual\r\nexperience of cause and effect would have thus been exemplified through\r\nuniversal nature.\r\n\r\n_The heavens declare the glory of _GOD_, and the firmament sheweth his\r\nhandywork!

Malebranche; but these minute phenomena\r\nof vision have yet been thought reducible to no theory, though many\r\nphilosophers have employed a considerable degree of attention upon them:\r\namong these are Dr. Jurin, at the end of Dr. Smith's Optics; M.

M. p. 215.\r\n\r\nI must here apprize the reader, that it is very difficult for different\r\npeople to give the same names to various shades of colours; whence, in the\r\nfollowing pages, something must be allowed, if on repeating the experiments\r\nthe colours here mentioned should not accurately correspond with his own\r\nnames of them.\r\n\r\nI. _Activity of the Retina in Vision._\r\n\r\nFrom the subsequent experiments it appears, that the retina is in an active\r\nnot in a passive state during the existence of these ocular spectra; and it\r\nis thence to be concluded, that all vision is owing to the activity of this\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n1. Place a piece of red silk, about an inch in diameter, as in plate 1, at\r\nSect. III. 1., on a sheet of white paper, in a strong light; look steadily\r\nupon it from about the distance of half a yard for a minute; then closing\r\nyour eyelids cover them with your hands, and a green spectrum will be seen\r\nin your eyes, resembling in form the piece of red silk: after some time,\r\nthis spectrum will disappear and shortly reappear; and this alternately\r\nthree or four times, if the experiment is well made, till at length it\r\nvanishes entirely.\r\n\r\n2. Place on a sheet of white paper a circular piece of blue silk, about\r\nfour inches in diameter, in the sunshine; cover the center of this with a\r\ncircular piece of yellow silk, about three inches in diameter; and the\r\ncenter of the yellow silk with a circle of pink silk, about two inches in\r\ndiameter; and the center of the pink silk with a circle of green silk,\r\nabout one inch in diameter; and the centre of this with a circle of indigo,\r\nabout half an inch in diameter; make a small speck with ink in the very\r\ncenter of the whole, as in plate 3, at Sect. III. 3. 6.; look steadily for\r\na minute on this central spot, and then closing your eyes, and applying\r\nyour hand at about an inch distance before them, so as to prevent too much\r\nor too little light from passing through the eyelids, you will see the most\r\nbeautiful circles of colours that imagination can conceive, which are most\r\nresembled by the colours occasioned by pouring a drop or two of oil on a\r\nstill lake in a bright day; but these circular irises of colours are not\r\nonly different from the colours of the silks above mentioned, but are at\r\nthe same time perpetually changing as long as they exist.\r\n\r\n3. When any one in the dark presses either corner of his eye with his\r\nfinger, and turns his eye away from his finger, he will see a circle of\r\ncolours like those in a peacock's tail: and a sudden flash of light is\r\nexcited in the eye by a stroke on it. (Newton's Opt. Q. 16.)\r\n\r\n4. When any one turns round rapidly on one foot, till he becomes dizzy, and\r\nfalls upon the ground, the spectra of the ambient objects continue to\r\npresent themselves in rotation, or appear to librate, and he seems to\r\nbehold them for some time still in motion.\r\n\r\nFrom all these experiments it appears, that the spectra in the eye are not\r\nowing to the mechanical impulse of light impressed on the retina, nor to\r\nits chemical combination with that organ, nor to the absorption and\r\nemission of light, as is observed in many bodies; for in all these cases\r\nthe spectra must either remain uniformly, or gradually diminish; and\r\nneither their alternate pretence and evanescence as in the first\r\nexperiment, nor the perpetual changes of their colours as in the second,\r\nnor the flash of light or colours in the pressed eye as in the third, nor\r\nthe rotation or libration of the spectra as in the fourth, could exist.\r\n\r\nIt is not absurd to conceive, that the retina may be stimulated into\r\nmotion, as well as the red and white muscles which form our limbs and\r\nvessels; since it consists of fibres, like those, intermixed with its\r\nmedullary substance. To evince this structure, the retina of an ox's eye\r\nwas suspended in a glass of warm water, and forcibly torn in a few places;\r\nthe edges of these parts appeared jagged and hairy, and did not contract,\r\nand become smooth like simple mucus, when it is distended till it breaks;\r\nwhich shews that it consists of fibres; and that its fibrous construction\r\nbecame still more distinct to the sight, by adding some caustic alkali to\r\nthe water, as the adhering mucus was first eroded, and the hair-like fibres\r\nremained floating in the vessel. Nor does the degree of transparency of the\r\nretina invalidate the evidence of its fibrous structure, since Leeuwenhoek\r\nhas shewn that the crystalline humour itself consists of fibres. (Arcana\r\nNaturæ, V. 1. p. 70.)\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that as the muscles have larger fibres intermixed with a\r\nsmaller quantity of nervous medulla, the organ of vision has a greater\r\nquantity of nervous medulla intermixed with smaller fibres; and it is\r\nprobable that the locomotive muscles, as well as the vascular ones, of\r\nmicroscopic animals have much greater tenuity than these of the retina.\r\n\r\nAnd besides the similar laws, which will be shewn in this paper to govern\r\nalike the actions of the retina and of the muscles, there are many other\r\nanalogies which exist between them. They are both originally excited into\r\naction by irritations, both are nearly in the same quantity of time, are\r\nalike strengthened or fatigued by exertion, are alike painful if excited\r\ninto action when they are in an inflamed state, are alike liable to\r\nparalysis, and to the torpor of old age.\r\n\r\nII. OF SPECTRA FROM DEFECT OF SENSIBILITY.\r\n\r\n    _The retina is not so easily excited into action by less irritation\r\n    after having been lately subjected to greater._\r\n\r\n1. When any one passes from the bright daylight into a darkened room, the\r\nirises of his eyes expand themselves to their utmost extent in a few\r\nseconds of time; but it is very long before the optic nerve, after having\r\nbeen stimulated by the greater light of the day, becomes sensible of the\r\nless degree of it in the room; and, if the room is not too obscure, the\r\nirises will again contract themselves in some degree, as the sensibility of\r\nthe retina returns.\r\n\r\n2. Place about half an inch square of white paper on a black hat, and\r\nlooking steadily on the center of it for a minute, remove your eyes to a\r\nsheet of white paper; and after a second or two a dark square will be seen\r\non the white paper, which will continue some time. A similar dark square\r\nwill be seen in the closed eye, if light be admitted through the eyelids.\r\n\r\nSo after looking at any luminous object of a small size, as at the sun, for\r\na short time, so as not much to fatigue the eyes, this part of the retina\r\nbecomes less sensible to smaller quantities of light; hence, when the eyes\r\nare turned on other less luminous parts of the sky, a dark spot is seen\r\nresembling the shape of the sun, or other luminous object which we last\r\nbeheld. This is the source of one kind of the dark-coloured _muscæ\r\nvolitantes_. If this dark spot lies above the center of the eye, we turn\r\nour eyes that way, expecting to bring it into the center of the eye, that\r\nwe may view it more distinctly; and in this case the dark spectrum seems to\r\nmove upwards. If the dark spectrum is found beneath the centre of the eye,\r\nwe pursue it from the same motive, and it seems to move downwards. This has\r\ngiven rise to various conjectures of something floating in the aqueous\r\nhumours of the eyes; but whoever, in attending to these spots, keeps his\r\neyes unmoved by looking steadily at the corner of a cloud, at the same time\r\nthat he observes the dark spectra, will be thoroughly convinced, that they\r\nhave no motion but what is given to them by the movement of our eyes in\r\npursuit of them. Sometimes the form of the spectrum, when it has been\r\nreceived from a circular luminous body, will become oblong; and sometimes\r\nit will be divided into two circular spectra, which is not owing to our\r\nchanging the angle made by the two optic axises, according to the distance\r\nof the clouds or other bodies to which the spectrum is supposed to be\r\ncontiguous, but to other causes mentioned in No. X. 3. of this section. The\r\napparent size of it will also be variable according to its supposed\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAs these spectra are more easily observable when our eyes are a little\r\nweakened by fatigue, it has frequently happened, that people of delicate\r\nconstitutions have been much alarmed at them, fearing a beginning decay of\r\ntheir sight, and have thence fallen into the hands of ignorant oculists;\r\nbut I believe they never are a prelude to any other disease of the eye, and\r\nthat it is from habit alone, and our want of attention to them, that we do\r\nnot see them on all objects every hour of our lives. But as the nerves of\r\nvery weak people lose their sensibility, in the same manner as their\r\nmuscles lose their activity, by a small time of exertion, it frequently\r\nhappens, that sick people in the extreme debility of fevers are perpetually\r\nemployed in picking something from the bed-clothes, occasioned by their\r\nmistaking the appearance of these _muscæ volitantes_ in their eyes.\r\nBenvenuto Celini, an Italian artist, a man of strong abilities, relates,\r\nthat having passed the whole night on a distant mountain with some\r\ncompanions and a conjurer, and performed many ceremonies to raise the\r\ndevil, on their return in the morning to Rome, and looking up when the sun\r\nbegan to rise, they saw numerous devils run on the tops of the houses, as\r\nthey passed along; so much were the spectra of their weakened eyes\r\nmagnified by fear, and made subservient to the purposes of fraud or\r\nsuperstition. (Life of Ben. Celini.)\r\n\r\n3. Place a square inch of white paper on a large piece of straw-coloured\r\nsilk; look steadily some time on the white paper, and then move the centre\r\nof your eyes on the silk, and a spectrum of the form of the paper will\r\nappear on the silk, of a deeper yellow than the other part of it: for the\r\ncentral part of the retina, having been some time exposed to the stimulus\r\nof a greater quantity of white light, is become less sensible to a smaller\r\nquantity of it, and therefore sees only the yellow rays in that part of the\r\nstraw-coloured silk.\r\n\r\nFacts similar to these are observable in other parts of our system: thus,\r\nif one hand be made warm, and the other exposed to the cold, and then both\r\nof them immersed in subtepid water, the water is perceived warm to one\r\nhand, and cold to the other; and we are not able to hear weak sounds for\r\nsome time after we have been exposed to loud ones; and we feel a chilliness\r\non coming into an atmosphere of temperate warmth, after having been some\r\ntime confined in a very warm room: and hence the stomach, and other organs\r\nof digestion, of those who have been habituated to the greater stimulus of\r\nspirituous liquor, are not excited into their due action by the less\r\nstimulus of common food alone; of which the immediate consequence is\r\nindigestion and hypochondriacism.\r\n\r\nIII. OF SPECTRA FROM EXCESS OF SENSIBILITY.\r\n\r\n    _The retina is more easily excited into action by greater irritation\r\n    after having been lately subjected to less._\r\n\r\n1. If the eyes are closed, and covered perfectly with a hat, for a minute\r\nor two, in a bright day; on removing the hat a red or crimson light is seen\r\nthrough the eyelids. In this experiment the retina, after being some time\r\nkept in the dark, becomes so sensible to a small quantity of light, as to\r\nperceive distinctly the greater quantity of red rays than of others which\r\npass through the eyelids. A similar coloured light is seen to pass through\r\nthe edges of the fingers, when the open hand is opposed to the flame of a\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\n2. If you look for some minutes steadily on a window in the beginning of\r\nthe evening twilight, or in a dark day, and then move your eyes a little,\r\nso that those parts of the retina, on which the dark frame-work of the\r\nwindow was delineated, may now fall on the glass part of it, many luminous\r\nlines, representing the frame-work, will appear to lie across the glass\r\npanes: for those parts of the retina, which were before least stimulated by\r\nthe dark frame-work, are now more sensible to light than the other parts of\r\nthe retina which were exposed to the more luminous parts of the window,\r\n\r\n3. Make with ink on white paper a very black spot, about half an inch in\r\ndiameter, with a tail about an inch in length, so as to represent a\r\ntadpole, as in plate 2, at Sect. III. 3. 3.; look steadily for a minute on\r\nthis spot, and, on moving the eye a little, the figure of the tadpole will\r\nbe seen on the white part of the paper, which figure of the tadpole will\r\nappear whiter or more luminous than the other parts of the white paper; for\r\nthe part of the retina on which the tadpole was delineated, is now more\r\nsensible to light, than the other parts of it, which were exposed to the\r\nwhite paper. This experiment is mentioned by Dr. Irwin, but is not by him\r\nascribed to the true cause, namely, the greater sensibility of that part of\r\nthe retina which has been exposed to the black spot, than of the other\r\nparts which had received the white field of paper, which is put beyond a\r\ndoubt by the next experiment.\r\n\r\n4. On closing the eyes after viewing the black spot on the white paper, as\r\nin the foregoing experiment, a red spot is seen of the form of the black\r\nspot: for that part of the retina, on which the black spot was delineated,\r\nbeing now more sensible to light than the other parts of it, which were\r\nexposed to the white paper, is capable of perceiving the red rays which\r\npenetrate the eyelids. If this experiment be made by the light of a tallow\r\ncandle, the spot will be yellow instead of red; for tallow candles abound\r\nmuch with yellow light, which passes in greater quantity and force through\r\nthe eyelids than blue tight; hence the difficulty of distinguishing blue\r\nand green by this kind of candle light. The colour of the spectrum may\r\npossibly vary in the daylight, according to the different colour of the\r\nmeridian or the morning or evening light.\r\n\r\nM. Beguelin, in the Berlin Memoires, V. II. 1771, observes, that, when he\r\nheld a book so that the sun shone upon his half-closed eyelids, the black\r\nletters, which he had long inspected, became red, which must have been thus\r\noccasioned. Those parts of the retina which had received for some time the\r\nblack letters, were so much more sensible than those parts which had been\r\nopposed to the white paper, that to the former the red light, which passed\r\nthrough the eyelids, was perceptible. There is a similar story told, I\r\nthink, in de Voltaire's Historical Works, of a Duke of Tuscany, who was\r\nplaying at dice with the general of a foreign army, and, believing he saw\r\nbloody spots upon the dice, portended dreadful events, and retired in\r\nconfusion. The observer, after looking for a minute on the black spots of a\r\ndie, and carelessly closing his eyes, on a bright day; would see the image\r\nof a die with red spots upon it, as above explained.\r\n\r\n5. On emerging from a dark cavern, where we have long continued, the light\r\nof a bright day becomes intolerable to the eye for a considerable time,\r\nowing to the excess of sensibility existing in the eye, after having been\r\nlong exposed to little or no stimulus. This occasions us immediately to\r\ncontract the iris to its smallest aperture, which becomes again gradually\r\ndilated, as the retina becomes accustomed to the greater stimulus of the\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nThe twinkling of a bright star, or of a distant candle in the night, is\r\nperhaps owing to the same cause. While we continue to look upon these\r\nluminous objects, their central parts gradually appear paler, owing to the\r\ndecreasing sensibility of the part of the retina exposed to their light;\r\nwhilst, at the same time, by the unsteadiness of the eye, the edges of them\r\nare perpetually falling on parts of the retina that were just before\r\nexposed to the darkness of the night, and therefore tenfold more sensible\r\nto light than the part on which the star or candle had been for some time\r\ndelineated. This pains the eye in a similar manner as when we come suddenly\r\nfrom a dark room into bright daylight, and gives the appearance of bright\r\nscintillations. Hence the stars twinkle most when the night is darkest, and\r\ndo not twinkle through telescopes, as observed by Musschenbroeck; and it\r\nwill afterwards be seen why this twinkling is sometimes of different\r\ncolours when the object is very bright, as Mr. Melvill observed in looking\r\nat Sirius. For the opinions of others on this subject, see Dr. Priestley's\r\nvaluable History of Light and Colours, p. 494.\r\n\r\nMany facts observable in the animal system are similar to these; as the hot\r\nglow occasioned by the usual warmth of the air, or our clothes, on coming\r\nout of a cold bath; the pain of the fingers on approaching the fire after\r\nhaving handled snow; and the inflamed heels from walking in snow. Hence\r\nthose who have been exposed to much cold have died on being brought to a\r\nfire, or their limbs have become so much inflamed as to mortify. Hence much\r\nfood or wine given suddenly to those who have almost perished by hunger has\r\ndestroyed them; for all the organs of the famished body are now become so\r\nmuch more irritable to the stimulus of food and wine, which they have long\r\nbeen deprived of, that inflammation is excited, which terminates in\r\ngangrene or fever.\r\n\r\nIV. OF DIRECT OCULAR SPECTRA.\r\n\r\n    _A quantity of stimulus somewhat greater than natural excites the\r\n    retina into spasmodic action, which ceases in a few seconds._\r\n\r\nA certain duration and energy of the stimulus of light and colours excites\r\nthe perfect action of the retina in vision; for very quick motions are\r\nimperceptible to us, as well as very slow ones, as the whirling of a top,\r\nor the shadow on a sun-dial. So perfect darkness does not affect the eye at\r\nall; and excess of light produces pain, not vision.\r\n\r\n1. When a fire-coal is whirled round in the dark, a lucid circle remains a\r\nconsiderable time in the eye; and that with so much vivacity of light, that\r\nit is mistaken for a continuance of the irritation of the object. In the\r\nsame manner, when a fiery meteor shoots across the night, it appears to\r\nleave a long lucid train behind it, part of which, and perhaps sometimes\r\nthe whole, is owing to the continuance of the action of the retina after\r\nhaving been thus vividly excited. This is beautifully illustrated by the\r\nfollowing experiment: fix a paper sail, three or four inches in diameter,\r\nand made like that of a smoke jack, on a tube of pasteboard; on looking\r\nthrough the tube at a distant prospect, some disjointed parts of it will be\r\nseen through the narrow intervals between the sails; but as the fly begins\r\nto revolve, these intervals appear larger; and when it revolves quicker,\r\nthe whole prospect is seen quite as distinct as if nothing intervened,\r\nthough less luminous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n2. Look through a dark tube, about half a yard long, at the area of a\r\nyellow circle of half an inch diameter, lying upon a blue area of double\r\nthat diameter, for half a minute; and on closing your eyes the colours of\r\nthe spectrum will appear similar to the two areas, as in fig. 3.; but if\r\nthe eye is kept too long upon them, the colours of the spectrum will be the\r\nreverse of those upon the paper, that is, the internal circle will become\r\nblue, and the external area yellow; hence some attention is required in\r\nmaking this experiment.\r\n\r\n3. Place the bright flame of a spermaceti candle before a black object in\r\nthe night; look steadily at it for a short time, till it is observed to\r\nbecome somewhat paler; and on closing the eyes, and covering them\r\ncarefully, but not so as to compress them, the image of the blazing candle\r\nwill continue distinctly to be visible.\r\n\r\n4. Look steadily, for a short time, at a window in a dark day, as in Exp.\r\n2. Sect. III. and then closing your eyes, and covering them with your\r\nhands, an exact delineation of the window remains for some time visible in\r\nthe eye. This experiment requires a little practice to make it succeed\r\nwell; since, if the eyes are fatigued by looking too long on the window, or\r\nthe day be too bright, the luminous parts of the window will appear dark in\r\nthe spectrum, and the dark parts of the frame-work will appear luminous, as\r\nin Exp. 2. Sect. III. And it is even difficult for many, who first try this\r\nexperiment, to perceive the spectrum at all; for any hurry of mind, or even\r\ntoo great attention to the spectrum itself, will disappoint them, till they\r\nhave had a little experience in attending to such small sensations.\r\n\r\nThe spectra described in this section, termed direct ocular spectra, are\r\nproduced without much fatigue of the eye; the irritation of the luminous\r\nobject being soon withdrawn, or its quantity of light being not so great as\r\nto produce any degree of uneasiness in the organ of vision; which\r\ndistinguishes them from the next class of ocular spectra, which are the\r\nconsequence of fatigue. These direct spectra are best observed in such\r\ncircumstances that no light, but what comes from the object, can fall upon\r\nthe eye; as in looking through a tube, of half a yard long, and an inch\r\nwide, at a yellow paper on the side of a room, the direct spectrum was\r\neasily produced on closing the eye without taking it from the tube; but if\r\nthe lateral light is admitted through the eyelids, or by throwing the\r\nspectrum on white paper, it becomes a reverse spectrum, as will be\r\nexplained below.\r\n\r\nThe other senses also retain for a time the impressions that have been made\r\nupon them, or the actions they have been excited into. So if a hard body is\r\npressed upon the palm of the hand, as is practised in tricks of\r\nlegerdemain, it is not easy to distinguish for a few seconds whether it\r\nremains or is removed; and tastes continue long to exist vividly in the\r\nmouth, as the smoke of tobacco, or the taste of gentian, after the sapid\r\nmaterial is withdrawn.\r\n\r\n    V. _A quantity of stimulus somewhat greater than the last mentioned\r\n    excites the retina into spasmodic action, which ceases and recurs\r\n    alternately._\r\n\r\n1. On looking for a time on the setting sun, so as not greatly to fatigue\r\nthe sight, a yellow spectrum is seen when the eyes are closed and covered,\r\nwhich continues for a time, and then disappears and recurs repeatedly\r\nbefore it entirely vanishes. This yellow spectrum of the sun when the\r\neyelids are opened becomes blue; and if it is made to fall on the green\r\ngrass, or on other coloured objects, it varies its own colour by an\r\nintermixture of theirs, as will be explained in another place.\r\n\r\n2. Place a lighted spermaceti candle in the night about one foot from your\r\neye, and look steadily on the centre of the flame, till your eye becomes\r\nmuch more fatigued than in Sect. IV. Exp. 3.; and on closing your eyes a\r\nreddish spectrum will be perceived, which will cease and return\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\nThe action of vomiting in like manner ceases, and is renewed by intervals,\r\nalthough the emetic drug is thrown up with the first effort: so after-pains\r\ncontinue some time after parturition; and the alternate pulsations of the\r\nheart of a viper are renewed for some time after it is cleared from its\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nVI. OF REVERSE OCULAR SPECTRA.\r\n\r\n    _The retina, after having been excited into action by a stimulus\r\n    somewhat greater them the last mentioned falls into opposite spasmodic\r\n    action._\r\n\r\nThe actions of every part of animal bodies may be advantageously compared\r\nwith each other. This strict analogy contributes much to the investigation\r\nof truth; while those looser analogies, which compare the phenomena of\r\nanimal life with those of chemistry or mechanics, only serve to mislead our\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nWhen any of our larger muscles have been in long or in violent action, and\r\ntheir antagonists have been at the same time extended, as soon as the\r\naction of the former ceases, the limb is stretched the contrary way for our\r\nease, and a pandiculation or yawning takes place.\r\n\r\nBy the following observations it appears, that a similar circumstance\r\nobtains in the organ of vision; after it has been fatigued by one kind of\r\naction, it spontaneously falls into the opposite kind.\r\n\r\n1. Place a piece of coloured silk, about an inch in diameter, on a sheet of\r\nwhite paper, about half a yard from your eyes; look steadily upon it for a\r\nminute; then remove your eyes upon another part of the white paper, and a\r\nspectrum will be seen of the form of the silk thus inspected, but of a\r\ncolour opposite to it. A spectrum nearly similar will appear if the eyes\r\nare closed, and the eyelids shaded by approaching the hand near them, so as\r\nto permit some, but to prevent too much light falling on them.\r\n\r\n  Red silk produced a green spectrum.\r\n  Green produced a red one.\r\n  Orange produced blue.\r\n  Blue produced orange.\r\n  Yellow produced violet.\r\n  Violet produced yellow.\r\n\r\nThat in these experiments the colours of the spectra are the reverse of the\r\ncolours which occasioned them, may be seen by examining the third figure in\r\nSir Isaac Newton's Optics, L. II. p. 1, where those thin laminæ of air,\r\nwhich reflected yellow, transmitted violet; those which reflected red,\r\ntransmitted a blue green; and so of the rest, agreeing with the experiments\r\nabove related.\r\n\r\n2. These reverse spectra are similar to a colour, formed by a combination\r\nof all the primary colours except that with which the eye has been fatigued\r\nin making the experiment: thus the reverse spectrum of red must be such a\r\ngreen as would be produced by a combination of all the other prismatic\r\ncolours. To evince this fact the following satisfactory experiment was\r\nmade. The prismatic colours were laid on a circular pasteboard wheel, about\r\nfour inches in diameter, in the proportions described in Dr. Priestley's\r\nHistory of Light and Colours, pl. 12. fig. 83. except that the red\r\ncompartment was entirely left out, and the others proportionably extended\r\nso as to complete the circle. Then, as the orange is a mixture of red and\r\nyellow, and as the violet is a mixture of red and indigo, it became\r\nnecessary to put yellow on the wheel instead of orange, and indigo instead\r\nof violet, that the experiment might more exactly quadrate with the theory\r\nit was designed to establish or confute; because in gaining a green\r\nspectrum from a red object, the eye is supposed to have become insensible\r\nto red light. This wheel, by means of an axis, was made to whirl like a\r\ntop; and on its being put in motion, a green colour was produced,\r\ncorresponding with great exactness to the reverse spectrum of red.\r\n\r\n3. In contemplating any one or these reverse spectra in the closed and\r\ncovered eye, it disappears and re-appears several times successively, till\r\nat length it entirely vanishes, like the direct spectra in Sect. V.; but\r\nwith this additional circumstance, that when the spectrum becomes faint or\r\nevanescent, it is instantly revived by removing the hand from before the\r\neyelids, so as to admit more light: because then not only the fatigued part\r\nof the retina is inclined spontaneously to fall into motions of a contrary\r\ndirection, but being still sensible to all other rays of light, except that\r\nwith which it was lately fatigued, is by these rays at the same time\r\nstimulated into those motions which form the reverse spectrum.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments there is reason to conclude, that the fatigued part\r\nof the retina throws itself into a contrary mode of action, like oscitation\r\nor pandiculation, as soon as the stimulus which has fatigued it is\r\nwithdrawn; and that it still remains sensible, that is, liable to be\r\nexcited into action by any other colours at the same time, except the\r\ncolour with which it has been fatigued.\r\n\r\n    VII. _The retina after having been excited into action by a stimulus\r\n    somewhat greater than the last mentioned falls into various successive\r\n    spasmodic actions._\r\n\r\n1. On looking at the meridian sun as long as the eyes can well bear its\r\nbrightness, the disk first becomes pale, with a luminous crescent, which\r\nseems to librate from one edge of it to the other, owing to the\r\nunsteadiness of the eye; then the whole phasis of the sun becomes blue,\r\nsurrounded with a white halo; and on closing the eyes, and covering them\r\nwith the hands, a yellow spectrum is seen, which in a little time changes\r\ninto a blue one.\r\n\r\nM. de la Hire observed, after looking at the bright sun, that the\r\nimpression in his eye first assumed a yellow appearance, and then green,\r\nand then blue; and wishes to ascribe these appearances to some affection of\r\nthe nerves. (Porterfield on the Eye, Vol. I. p. 313.)\r\n\r\n2. After looking steadily on about an inch square of pink silk, placed on\r\nwhite paper, in a bright sunshine, at the distance of a foot from my eyes,\r\nand closing and covering my eyelids, the spectrum of the silk was at first\r\na dark green, and the spectrum of the white paper became of a pink. The\r\nspectra then both disappeared; and then the internal spectrum was blue; and\r\nthen, after a second disappearance, became yellow, and lastly pink, whilst\r\nthe spectrum of the field varied into red and green.\r\n\r\nThese successions of different coloured spectra were not exactly the same\r\nin the different experiments, though observed, as near as could be, with\r\nthe same quantity of light, and other similar circumstances; owing, I\r\nsuppose, to trying too many experiments at a time; so that the eye was not\r\nquite free from the spectra of the colours which were previously attended\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe alternate exertions of the retina in the preceding section resembled\r\nthe oscitation or pandiculation of the muscles, as they were performed in\r\ndirections contrary to each other, and were the consequence of fatigue\r\nrather than of pain. And in this they differ from the successive dissimilar\r\nexertions of the retina, mentioned in this section, which resemble in\r\nminiature the more violent agitations of the limbs in convulsive diseases,\r\nas epilepsy, chorea S. Viti, and opisthotonos; all which diseases are\r\nperhaps, at first, the consequence of pain, and have their periods\r\nafterwards established by habit.\r\n\r\n    VIII. _The retina, after having been excited into action by a stimulus\r\n    somewhat greater than the last mentioned falls into a fixed spasmodic\r\n    action, which continues for some days._\r\n\r\n1. After having looked long at the meridian sun, in making some of the\r\npreceding experiments, till the disks faded into a pale blue, I frequently\r\nobserved a bright blue spectrum of the sun on other objects all the next\r\nand the succeeding day, which constantly occurred when I attended to it,\r\nand frequently when I did not previously attend to it. When I closed and\r\ncovered my eyes, this appeared of a dull yellow; and at other times mixed\r\nwith the colours of other objects on which it was thrown. It may be\r\nimagined, that this part of the retina was become insensible to white\r\nlight, and thence a bluish spectrum became visible on all luminous objects;\r\nbut as a yellowish spectrum was also seen in the closed and covered eye,\r\nthere can remain no doubt of this being the spectrum of the sun. A similar\r\nappearance was observed by M. Æpinus, which he acknowledges he could give\r\nno account of. (Nov. Com. Petrop. V. 10. p. 2. and 6.)\r\n\r\nThe locked jaw, and some cataleptic spasms, are resembled by this\r\nphenomenon; and from hence we may learn the danger to the eye by inspecting\r\nvery luminous objects too long a time.\r\n\r\nIX. _A quantity of stimulus greater than the preceding induces a temporary\r\nparalysis of the organ of vision._\r\n\r\n1. Place a circular piece of bright red silk, about half an inch in\r\ndiameter, on the middle of a sheet of white paper; lay them on the floor in\r\na bright sunshine, and fixing your eyes steadily on the center of the red\r\ncircle, for three or four minutes, at the distance of four or six feet from\r\nthe object, the red silk will gradually become paler, and finally cease to\r\nappear red at all.\r\n\r\n2. Similar to these are many other animal facts; as purges, opiates, and\r\neven poisons, and contagious matter, cease to stimulate our system, after\r\nwe have been habituated to their use. So some people sleep undisturbed by a\r\nclock, or even by a forge hammer in their neighbourhood: and not only\r\ncontinued irritations, but violent exertions of any kind, are succeeded by\r\ntemporary paralysis. The arm drops down after violent action, and continues\r\nfor a time useless; and it is probable, that those who have perished\r\nsuddenly in swimming, or in scating on the ice, have owed their deaths to\r\nthe paralysis, or extreme fatigue, which succeeds every violent and\r\ncontinued exertion.\r\n\r\nX. MISCELLANEOUS REMARKS.\r\n\r\nThere were some circumstances occurred in making these experiments, which\r\nwere liable to alter the results of them, and which I shall here mention\r\nfor the assistance of others, who may wish to repeat them.\r\n\r\n1. _Of direct and inverse spectra existing at the same time_; _of\r\nreciprocal direct spectra_; _of a combination of direct and inverse\r\nspectra_; _of a spectral halo_; _rules to pre-determine the colours of\r\nspectra_.\r\n\r\na. When an area, about six inches square, of bright pink Indian paper, had\r\nbeen viewed on an area, about a foot square, of white writing paper, the\r\ninternal spectrum in the closed eye was green, being the reverse spectrum\r\nof the pink paper; and the external spectrum was pink, being the direct\r\nspectrum of the pink paper. The same circumstance happened when the\r\ninternal area was white, and external one pink; that is, the internal\r\nspectrum was pink, and the external one green. All the same appearances\r\noccurred when the pink paper was laid on a black hat.\r\n\r\nb. When six inches square of deep violet polished paper was viewed on a\r\nfoot square of white writing paper, the internal spectrum was yellow, being\r\nthe reverse spectrum of the violet paper, and the external one was violet,\r\nbeing the direct spectrum of the violet paper.\r\n\r\nc. When six inches square of pink paper was viewed on a foot square of blue\r\npaper, the internal spectrum was blue, and the external spectrum was pink;\r\nthat is, the internal one was the direct spectrum of the external object,\r\nand the external one was the direct spectrum of the internal object,\r\ninstead of their being each the reverse spectrum of the objects they\r\nbelonged to.\r\n\r\nd. When six inches square of blue paper were viewed on a foot square of\r\nyellow paper, the interior spectrum became a brilliant yellow, and the\r\nexterior one a brilliant blue. The vivacity of the spectra was owing to\r\ntheir being excited both by the stimulus of the interior and exterior\r\nobjects; so that the interior yellow spectrum was both the reverse spectrum\r\nof the blue paper, and the direct one of the yellow paper; and the exterior\r\nblue spectrum was both the reverse spectrum of the yellow paper, and the\r\ndirect one of the blue paper.\r\n\r\ne. When the internal area was only a square half-inch of red paper, laid on\r\na square foot of dark violet paper, the internal spectrum was green, with a\r\nreddish-blue halo. When the red internal paper was two inches square, the\r\ninternal spectrum was a deeper green, and the external one redder. When the\r\ninternal paper was six inches square, the spectrum of it became blue, and\r\nthe spectrum of the external paper was red.\r\n\r\nf. When a square half-inch of blue paper was laid on a six-inch square of\r\nyellow paper, the spectrum of the central paper in the closed eye was\r\nyellow, incircled with a blue halo. On looking long on the meridian sun,\r\nthe disk fades into a pale blue surrounded with a whitish halo.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances, though they very much perplexed the experiments till\r\nthey were investigated, admit of a satisfactory explanation; for while the\r\nrays from the bright internal object in exp. a. fall with their full force\r\non the center of the retina, and, by fatiguing that part of it, induce the\r\nreverse spectrum, many scattered rays, from the same internal pink paper,\r\nfall on the more external parts of the retina, but not in such quantity as\r\nto occasion much fatigue, and hence induce the direct spectrum of the pink\r\ncolour in those parts of the eye. The same reverse and direct spectra occur\r\nfrom the violet paper in exp. b.: and in exp. c. the scattered rays from\r\nthe central pink paper produce a direct spectrum of this colour on the\r\nexternal parts of the eye, while the scattered rays from the external blue\r\npaper produce a direct spectrum of that colour on the central part of the\r\neye, instead of these parts of the retina falling reciprocally into their\r\nreverse spectra. In exp. d. the colours being the reverse of each other,\r\nthe scattered rays from the exterior object falling on the central parts of\r\nthe eye, and there exciting their direct spectrum, at the same time that\r\nthe retina was excited into a reverse spectrum by the central object, and\r\nthis direct and reverse spectrum being of similar colour, the superior\r\nbrilliancy of this spectrum was produced. In exp. e. the effect of various\r\nquantities of stimulus on the retina, from the different respective sizes\r\nof the internal and external areas, induced a spectrum of the internal area\r\nin the center of the eye, combined of the reverse spectrum of that internal\r\narea and the direct one of the external area, in various shades of colour,\r\nfrom a pale green to a deep blue, with similar changes in the spectrum of\r\nthe external area. For the same reasons, when an internal bright object was\r\nsmall, as in exp. f. instead of the whole of the spectrum of the external\r\nobject being reverse to the colour of the internal object, only a kind of\r\nhalo, or radiation of colour, similar to that of the internal object, was\r\nspread a little way on the external spectrum. For this internal blue area\r\nbeing so small, the scattered rays from it extended but a little way on the\r\nimage of the external area of yellow paper, and could therefore produce\r\nonly a blue halo round the yellow spectrum in the center.\r\n\r\nIf any one should suspect that the scattered rays from the exterior\r\ncoloured object do not intermix with the rays from the interior coloured\r\nobject, and thus affect the central part of the eye, let him look through\r\nan opake tube, about two feet in length, and an inch in diameter, at a\r\ncoloured wall of a room with one eye, and with the other eye naked; and he\r\nwill find, that by shutting out the lateral light, the area of the wall\r\nseen through a tube appears as if illuminated by the sunshine, compared\r\nwith the other parts of it; from whence arises the advantage of looking\r\nthrough a dark tube at distant paintings.\r\n\r\nHence we may safely deduce the following rules to determine before-hand the\r\ncolours of all spectra. 1. The direct spectrum without any lateral light is\r\nan evanescent representation of its object in the unfatigued eye. 2. With\r\nsome lateral light it becomes of a colour combined of the direct spectrum\r\nof the central object, and of the circumjacent objects, in proportion to\r\ntheir respective quantity and brilliancy. 3. The reverse spectrum without\r\nlateral light is a representation in the fatigued eye of the form of its\r\nobjects, with such a colour as would be produced by all the primary\r\ncolours, except that of the object. 4. With lateral light the colour is\r\ncompounded of the reverse spectrum of the central object, and the direct\r\nspectrum of the circumjacent objects, in proportion to their respective\r\nquantity and brilliancy.\r\n\r\n2. _Variation and vivacity of the spectra occasioned by extraneous light._\r\n\r\nThe reverse spectrum, as has been before explained, is similar to a colour,\r\nformed by a combination of all the primary colours, except that with which\r\nthe eye has been fatigued in making the experiment: so the reverse spectrum\r\nof red is such a green as would be produced by a combination of all the\r\nother prismatic colours. Now it must be observed, that this reverse\r\nspectrum of red is therefore the direct spectrum of a combination of all\r\nthe other prismatic colours, except the red; whence, on removing the eye\r\nfrom a piece of red silk to a sheet of white paper, the green spectrum,\r\nwhich is perceived, may either be called the reverse spectrum of the red\r\nsilk, or the direct spectrum of all the rays from the white paper, except\r\nthe red; for in truth it is both. Hence we see the reason why it is not\r\neasy to gain a direct spectrum of any coloured object in the day-time,\r\nwhere there is much lateral light, except of very bright objects, as of the\r\nsetting sun, or by looking through an opake tube; because the lateral\r\nexternal light falling also on the central part of the retina, contributes\r\nto induce the reverse spectrum, which is at the same time the direct\r\nspectrum of that lateral light, deducting only the colour of the central\r\nobject which we have been viewing. And for the same reason, it is difficult\r\nto gain the reverse spectrum, where there is no lateral light to contribute\r\nto its formation. Thus, in looking through an opake tube on a yellow wall,\r\nand closing my eye, without admitting any lateral light, the spectra were\r\nall at first yellow; but at length changed into blue. And on looking in the\r\nsame manner on red paper, I did at length get a green spectrum; but they\r\nwere all at first red ones: and the same after looking at a candle in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe reverse spectrum was formed with greater facility when the eye was\r\nthrown from the object on a sheet of white paper, or when light was\r\nadmitted through the closed eyelids; because not only the fatigued part of\r\nthe retina was inclined spontaneously to fall into motions of a contrary\r\ndirection; but being still sensible to all other rays of light except that\r\nwith which it was lately fatigued, was by these rays stimulated at the same\r\ntime into those motions which form the reverse spectrum. Hence, when, the\r\nreverse spectrum of any colour became faint, it was wonderfully revived by\r\nadmitting more light through the eyelids, by removing the hand from before\r\nthem: and hence, on covering the closed eyelids, the spectrum would often\r\ncease for a time, till the retina became sensible to the stimulus of the\r\nsmaller quantity of light, and then it recurred. Nor was the spectrum only\r\nchanged in vivacity, or in degree, by this admission of light through the\r\neyelids; but it frequently happened, after having viewed bright objects,\r\nthat the spectrum in the closed and covered eye was changed into a third\r\nspectrum, when light was admitted through the eyelids: which third spectrum\r\nwas composed of such colours as could pass through the eyelids, except\r\nthose of the object. Thus, when an area of half an inch diameter of pink\r\npaper was viewed on a sheet of white paper in the sunshine, the spectrum\r\nwith closed and covered eyes was green; but on removing the hands from\r\nbefore the closed eyelids, the spectrum became yellow, and returned\r\ninstantly again to green, as often as the hands were applied to cover the\r\neyelids, or removed from them: for the retina being now insensible to red\r\nlight, the yellow rays passing through the eyelids in greater quantity than\r\nthe other colours, induced a yellow spectrum; whereas if the spectrum was\r\nthrown on white paper, with the eyes open, it became only a lighter green.\r\n\r\nThough a certain quantity of light facilitates the formation of the reverse\r\nspectrum, a greater quantity prevents its formation, as the more powerful\r\nstimulus excites even the fatigued parts of the eye into action; otherwise\r\nwe should see the spectrum of the last viewed object as often as we turn\r\nour eyes. Hence the reverse spectra are best seen by gradually approaching\r\nthe hand near the closed eyelids to a certain distance only, which must be\r\nvaried with the brightness of the day, or the energy of the spectrum. Add\r\nto this, that all dark spectra, as black, blue, or green, if light be\r\nadmitted through the eyelids, after they have been some time covered, give\r\nreddish spectra, for the reasons given in Sect. III. Exp. 1.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances of the extraneous light coinciding with the\r\nspontaneous efforts of the fatigued retina to produce a reverse spectrum,\r\nas was observed before, it is not easy to gain a direct spectrum, except of\r\nobjects brighter than the ambient light; such as a candle in the night, the\r\nsetting sun, or viewing a bright object through an opake tube; and then the\r\nreverse spectrum is instantaneously produced by the admission of some\r\nexternal light; and is as instantly converted again to the direct spectrum\r\nby the exclusion of it. Thus, on looking at the setting sun, on closing the\r\neyes, and covering them, a yellow spectrum is seen, which is the direct\r\nspectrum of the setting sun; but on opening the eyes on the sky, the yellow\r\nspectrum is immediately changed into a blue one, which is the reverse\r\nspectrum of the yellow sun, or the direct spectrum of the blue sky, or a\r\ncombination of both. And this is again transformed into a yellow one on\r\nclosing the eyes, and so reciprocally, as quick as the motions of the\r\nopening and closing eyelids. Hence, when Mr. Melvill observed the\r\nscintillations of the star Sirius to be sometimes coloured, these were\r\nprobably the direct spectrum of the blue sky on the parts of the retina\r\nfatigued by the white light of the star. (Essays Physical and Literary, p.\r\n81. V. 2.)\r\n\r\nWhen a direct spectrum is thrown on colours darker than itself, it mixes\r\nwith them; as the yellow spectrum of the setting sun, thrown on the green\r\ngrass, becomes a greener yellow. But when a direct spectrum is thrown on\r\ncolours brighter than itself, it becomes instantly changed into the reverse\r\nspectrum, which mixes with those brighter colours. So the yellow spectrum\r\nof the setting sun thrown on the luminous sky becomes blue, and changes\r\nwith the colour or brightness of the clouds on which it appears. But the\r\nreverse spectrum mixes with every kind of colour on which it is thrown,\r\nwhether brighter than itself or not; thus the reverse spectrum, obtained by\r\nviewing a piece of yellow silk, when thrown on white paper, was a lucid\r\nblue green; when thrown on black Turkey leather, becomes a deep violet. And\r\nthe spectrum of blue silk, thrown on white paper, was a light yellow; on\r\nblack silk was an obscure orange; and, the blue spectrum, obtained from\r\norange-coloured silk, thrown on yellow, became a green.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the retina is thrown into activity or sensation by the\r\nstimulus of external colours, at the same time that it continues the\r\nactivity or sensation which forms the spectra; in the same manner as the\r\nprismatic colours, painted on a whirling top, are seen to mix together.\r\nWhen these colours of external objects are brighter than the direct\r\nspectrum which is thrown upon them, they change it into the reverse\r\nspectrum, like the admission of external light on a direct spectrum, as\r\nexplained above. When they are darker than the direct spectrum, they mix\r\nwith it, their weaker stimulus being inefficient to induce the reverse\r\nspectrum.\r\n\r\n3. _Variation of spectra in respect to number, and figure, and remission._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nWhen we look long and attentively at any object, the eye cannot always be\r\nkept entirely motionless; hence, on inspecting a circular area of red silk\r\nplaced on white paper, a lucid crescent or edge is seen to librate on one\r\nside or other of the red circle: for the exterior parts of the retina\r\nsometimes falling on the edge of the central silk, and sometimes on the\r\nwhite paper, are less fatigued with red light than the central part of the\r\nretina, which is constantly, exposed to it; and therefore, when they fall\r\non the edge of the red silk, they perceive it more vividly. Afterwards,\r\nwhen the eye becomes fatigued, a green spectrum in the form of a crescent\r\nis seen to librate on one side or other of the central circle, as by the\r\nunsteadiness of the eye a part of the fatigued retina falls on the white\r\npaper; and as by the increasing fatigue of the eye the central part of the\r\nsilk appears paler, the edge on which the unfatigued part of the retina\r\noccasionally falls will appear of a deeper red than the original silk,\r\nbecause it is compared with the pale internal part of it. M. de Buffon in\r\nmaking this experiment observed, that the red edge of the silk was not only\r\ndeeper coloured than the original silk; but, on his retreating a little\r\nfrom it, it became oblong, and at length divided into two, which must have\r\nbeen owing to his observing it either before or behind the point of\r\nintersection of the two optic axises. Thus, if a pen is held up before a\r\ndistant candle, when we look intensely at the pen two candles are seen\r\nbehind it; when we look intensely at the candle two pens are seen. If the\r\nsight be unsteady at the time of beholding the sun, even though one eye\r\nonly be used, many images of the sun will appear, or luminous lines, when\r\nthe eye is closed. And as some parts of these will be more vivid than\r\nothers, and some parts of them will be produced nearer the center of the\r\neye than others, these will disappear sooner than the others; and hence the\r\nnumber and shape of these spectra of the sun will continually vary, as long\r\nas they exist. The cause of some being more vivid than others, is the\r\nunsteadiness of the eye of the beholder, so that some parts of the retina\r\nhave been longer exposed to the sunbeams. That some parts of a complicated\r\nspectrum fade and return before other parts of it, the following experiment\r\nevinces. Draw three concentric circles; the external one an inch and a half\r\nin diameter, the middle one an inch, and the internal one half an inch;\r\ncolour the external and internal areas blue, and the remaining one yellow,\r\nas in Fig. 4.; after having looked about a minute on the center of these\r\ncircles, in a bright light, the spectrum of the external area appears first\r\nin the closed eye, then the middle area, and lastly the central one; and\r\nthen the central one disappears, and the others in inverted order. If\r\nconcentric circles of more colours are added, it produces the beautiful\r\never changing spectrum in Sect. I. Exp. 2.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it would seem, that the center of the eye produces quicker\r\nremissions of spectra, owing perhaps to its greater sensibility; that is,\r\nto its more energetic exertions. These remissions of spectra bear some\r\nanalogy to the tremors of the hands, and palpitations of the heart, of weak\r\npeople: and perhaps a criterion of the strength of any muscle or nerve may\r\nbe taken from the time it can be continued in exertion.\r\n\r\n4. _Variation of spectra in respect to brilliancy; the visibility of the\r\ncirculation of the blood in the eye._\r\n\r\n1. The meridian or evening light makes a difference in the colours of some\r\nspectra; for as the sun descends, the red rays, which are less refrangible\r\nby the convex atmosphere, abound in great quantity. Whence the spectrum of\r\nthe light parts of a window at this time, or early in the morning, is red;\r\nand becomes blue either a little later or earlier; and white in the\r\nmeridian day; and is also variable from the colour of the clouds or sky\r\nwhich are opposed to the window.\r\n\r\n2. All these experiments are liable to be confounded, if they are made too\r\nsoon after each other, as the remaining spectrum will mix with the new\r\nones. This is a very troublesome circumstance to painters, who are obliged\r\nto look long upon the same colour; and in particular to those whose eyes,\r\nfrom natural debility, cannot long, continue the same kind of exertion. For\r\nthe same reason, in making these experiments, the result becomes much\r\nvaried if the eyes, after viewing any object, are removed on other objects\r\nfor but an instant of time, before we close them to view the spectrum; for\r\nthe light from the object, of which we had only a transient view, in the\r\nvery time of closing our eyes acts as a stimulus on the fatigued retina;\r\nand for a time prevents the defined spectrum from appearing, or mixes its\r\nown spectrum with it. Whence, after the eyelids are closed, either a dark\r\nfield, or some unexpected colours, are beheld for a few seconds, before the\r\ndesired spectrum becomes distinctly visible.\r\n\r\n3. The length of time taken up in viewing an object, of which we are to\r\nobserve the spectrum, makes a great difference in the appearance of the\r\nspectrum, not only in its vivacity, but in its colour; as the direct\r\nspectrum of the central object, or of the circumjacent ones, and also the\r\nreverse spectra of both, with their various combinations, as well as the\r\ntime of their duration in the eye, and of their remissions or alternations,\r\ndepend upon the degree of fatigue the retina is subjected to. The Chevalier\r\nd'Arcy constructed a machine by which a coal of fire was whirled round in\r\nthe dark, and found, that when a luminous body made a revolution in eight\r\nthirds of time, it presented to the eye a complete circle of fire; from\r\nwhence he concludes, that the impression continues on the organ about the\r\nseventh part of a second. (Mem. de l'Acad. des Sc. 1765.) This, however, is\r\nonly to be considered as the shortest time of the duration of these direct\r\nspectra; since in the fatigued eye both the direct and reverse spectra,\r\nwith their intermissions, appear to take up many seconds of time, and seem\r\nvery variable in proportion to the circumstances of fatigue or energy.\r\n\r\n4. It sometimes happens, if the eyeballs have been rubbed hard with the\r\nfingers, that lucid sparks are seen in quick motion amidst the spectrum we\r\nare attending to. This is similar to the flashes of fire from a stroke on\r\nthe eye in fighting, and is resembled by the warmth and glow, which appears\r\nupon the skin after friction, and is probably owing to an acceleration of\r\nthe arterial blood into the vessels emptied by the previous pressure. By\r\nbeing accustomed to observe such small sensations in the eye, it is easy to\r\nsee the circulation of the blood in this organ. I have attended to this\r\nfrequently, when I have observed my eyes more than commonly sensible to\r\nother spectra. The circulation may be seen either in both eyes at a time,\r\nor only in one of them; for as a certain quantity of light is necessary to\r\nproduce this curious phenomenon, if one hand be brought nearer the closed\r\neyelids than the other, the circulation in that eye will for a time\r\ndisappear. For the easier viewing the circulation, it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to rub the eyes with a certain degree of force after they are\r\nclosed, and to hold the breath rather longer than is agreeable, which, by\r\naccumulating more blood in the eye, facilitates the experiment; but in\r\ngeneral it may be seen distinctly after having examined other spectra with\r\nyour back to the light, till the eyes become weary; then having covered\r\nyour closed eyelids for half a minute, till the spectrum is faded away\r\nwhich you were examining, turn your face to the light, and removing your\r\nhands from the eyelids, by and by again shade them a little, and the\r\ncirculation becomes curiously distinct. The streams of blood are however\r\ngenerally seen to unite, which shews it to be the venous circulation,\r\nowing, I suppose, to the greater opacity of the colour of the blood in\r\nthese vessels; for this venous circulation is also much more easily seen by\r\nthe microscope in the tail of a tadpole.\r\n\r\n5. _Variation of spectra in respect to distinctness and size; with a new\r\nway of magnifying objects._\r\n\r\n1. It was before observed, that when the two colours viewed together were\r\nopposite to each other, as yellow and blue, red and green, &c. according to\r\nthe table of reflections and transmissions of light in Sir Isaac Newton's\r\nOptics, B. II. Fig. 3. the spectra of those colours were of all others the\r\nmost brilliant, and best defined; because they were combined of the reverse\r\nspectrum of one colour, and of the direct spectrum of the other. Hence, in\r\nbooks printed with small types, or in the minute graduation of\r\nthermometers, or of clock-faces, which are to be seen at a distance, if the\r\nletters or figures are coloured with orange, and the ground with indigo; or\r\nthe letters with red, and the ground with green; or any other lucid colour\r\nis used for the letters, the spectrum of which is similar to the colour of\r\nthe ground; such letters will be seen much more distinctly, and with less\r\nconfusion, than in black or white: for as the spectrum of the letter is the\r\nsame colour with the ground on which they are seen, the unsteadiness of the\r\neye in long attending to them will not produce coloured lines by the edges\r\nof the letters, which is the principal cause of their confusion. The beauty\r\nof colours lying in vicinity to each other, whose spectra are thus\r\nreciprocally similar to each colour, is owing to this greater ease that the\r\neye experiences in beholding them distinctly; and it is probable, in the\r\norgan of hearing, a similar circumstance may constitute the pleasure of\r\nmelody. Sir Isaac Newton observes, that gold and indigo were agreeable when\r\nviewed together; and thinks there may be some analogy between the\r\nsensations of light and sound. (Optics, Qu. 14.)\r\n\r\nIn viewing the spectra of bright objects, as of an area of red silk of half\r\nan inch diameter on white paper, it is easy to magnify it to tenfold its\r\nsize: for if, when the spectrum is formed, you still keep your eye fixed on\r\nthe silk area, and remove it a few inches further from you, a green circle\r\nis seen round the red silk: for the angle now subtended by the silk is less\r\nthan it was when the spectrum was formed, but that of the spectrum\r\ncontinues the same, and our imagination places them at the same distance.\r\nThus when you view a spectrum on a sheet of white paper, if you approach\r\nthe paper to the eye, you may diminish it to a point; and if the paper is\r\nmade to recede from the eye, the spectrum will appear magnified in\r\nproportion to the distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nI was surprised, and agreeably amused, with the following experiment. I\r\ncovered a paper about four inches square with yellow, and with a pen filled\r\nwith a blue colour wrote upon the middle of it the word BANKS in capitals,\r\nas in Fig. 5, and sitting with my back to the sun, fixed my eyes for a\r\nminute exactly on the center of the letter N in the middle of the word;\r\nafter closing my eyes, and shading them somewhat with my hand, the word was\r\ndistinctly seen in the spectrum in yellow letters on a blue field; and\r\nthen, on opening my eyes on a yellowish wall at twenty feet distance, the\r\nmagnified name of BANKS appeared written on the wall in golden characters.\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIt was observed by the learned M. Sauvage (Nosol. Method. Cl. VIII. Ord.\r\ni.) that the pulsations of the optic artery might be perceived by looking\r\nattentively on a white wall well illuminated. A kind of net-work, darker\r\nthan the other parts of the wall, appears and vanishes alternately with\r\nevery pulsation. This change of the colour of the wall he well ascribes to\r\nthe compression of the retina by the diastole of the artery. The various\r\ncolours produced in the eye by the pressure of the finger, or by a stroke\r\non it, as mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton, seem likewise to originate from\r\nthe unequal pressure on various parts of the retina. Now as Sir Isaac\r\nNewton has shewn, that all the different colours are reflected or\r\ntransmitted by the laminæ of soap bubbles, or of air, according to their\r\ndifferent thickness or thinness, is it not probable, that the effect of the\r\nactivity of the retina may be to alter its thickness or thinness, so as\r\nbetter to adapt it to reflect or transmit the colours which stimulate it\r\ninto action? May not muscular fibres exist in the retina for this purpose,\r\nwhich may be less minute than the locomotive muscles of microscopic\r\nanimals? May not these muscular actions of the retina constitute the\r\nsensation of light and colours; and the voluntary repetitions of them, when\r\nthe object is withdrawn, constitute our memory of them? And lastly, may not\r\nthe laws of the sensations of light, here investigated, be applicable to\r\nall our other senses, and much contribute to elucidate many phenomena of\r\nanimal bodies both in their healthy and diseased state; and thus render\r\nthis investigation well worthy the attention of the physician, the\r\nmetaphysician, and the natural philosopher?\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1785.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Dum, Liber! astra petis volitans trepidantibus alis,\r\n    Irruis immemori, parvula gutta, mari.\r\n  Me quoque, me currente rotâ revolubilis ætas\r\n    Volverit in tenebras,--i, Liber, ipse sequor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINDEX TO THE SECTIONS OF PART FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  A.\r\n\r\n  Abortion from fear, xxxix. 6. 5.\r\n  Absorbent vessels, xxiii. 3. xxix. 1.\r\n  ---- regurgitate their fluids, xxix. 2.\r\n  ---- their valves, xxix. 2.\r\n  ---- communicate with vena portarum, xxvii. 2.\r\n  Absorption of solids, xxxiii. 3. 1. xxxvii.\r\n  ---- of fluids in anasarca, xxxv. 1. 3.\r\n  Accumulation of sensorial power, iv. 2. xii. 5. 2.\r\n  Activity of system too great, cure of, xii. 6.\r\n  ---- too small, cure of, xii. 7.\r\n  Age, old, xii. 3. 1. xxxvii. 4.\r\n  Ague-fit, xii. 7. 1. xxxii. 3. 4. xxxii. 9.\r\n  ---- how cured by bark, xii. 3. 4.\r\n  ---- periods, how occasioned, xii. 2. 3. xxxii. 3. 4.\r\n  Ague cakes, xxxii. 7. xxxii. 9.\r\n  Air, sense of fresh, xiv. 8.\r\n  ---- injures ulcers, xxviii. 2.\r\n  ---- injected into veins, xxxii. 5.\r\n  Alcohol deleterious, xxx. 3.\r\n  Alliterations, why agreeable, xxii. 2.\r\n  Aloes in lessened doses, xii. 3. 1.\r\n  American natives indolent, xxxi. 2.\r\n  ---- narrow shouldered, xxxi. 1.\r\n  Analogy intuitive, xvii. 3. 7.\r\n  Animals less liable to madness, xxxiii. 1.\r\n  ---- less liable to contagion, xxxiii. 1.\r\n  ---- how to teach, xxii. 3. 2.\r\n  ---- their similarity to each other, xxxix. 4. 8.\r\n  ---- their changes after nativity, xxxix. 4. 8.\r\n  ---- their changes before nativity, xxxix. 4. 8.\r\n  ---- less liable to contagious diseases, why, xxxiii. 1. 5.\r\n  ---- less liable to delirium and insanity, why, xxxiii. 1. 5.\r\n  ---- easier to preserve than to reproduce, xxxvii.\r\n  ---- food, distaste of, xxviii. 1.\r\n  ---- appetency, xxxix. 4. 7.\r\n  Antipathy, x. 2. 2.\r\n  Aphthæ, xxviii.\r\n  Apoplexy, xxxiv. 1. 7.\r\n  ---- not from deficient irritation, xxxii. 2. 1.\r\n  Appetites, xi. 2. 2. xiv. 8.\r\n  Architecture, xxii. 2. xvi. 10.\r\n  Arts, fine, xxii. 2.\r\n  Asparagus, its smell in urine, xxix.\r\n  Association defined, ii. 2. 11. iv. 7. v. 2.\r\n  ---- associate motions, x.\r\n  ---- stronger than irritative ones, xxiv. 2. 8.\r\n  ---- formed before nativity, xi. 3.\r\n  ---- with irritative ones, xxiv. 2. 8.\r\n  ---- with retrograde ones, xxv. 7. xxv. 10. xxv. 15.\r\n  ---- diseases from, xxxv.\r\n  Asthma, xviii. 15.\r\n  Attention, language of, xvi. 8. 6.\r\n  Atrophy, xxviii.\r\n  Aversion, origin of, xi. 2. 3.\r\n\r\n                  B.\r\n\r\n  Balance ourselves by vision, xx. 1.\r\n  Bandage increases absorption, xxxiii. 3. 2.\r\n  Barrenness, xxxvi. 2. 3.\r\n  Battement of sounds, xx. 7.\r\n  Bath, cold.
