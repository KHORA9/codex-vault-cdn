The former is characteristic of the imaginative\r\ntemperament, while the latter is analytical in its nature, and does\r\nnot rise above the level of the actual. Rightly pursued, these two\r\nways of searching out truth should supplement each other. The poet\r\nfinds in God the source of matter; the man of science traces matter up\r\nto God. Science is poetry inverted: the latter sees in the former\r\nconfirmation of its airiest flight; it is synthetic and creative,\r\nwhereas science dissects and analyzes. Obviously, the most spiritual\r\nconceptions should always maintain a basis in the world of fact, and\r\nthe greatest works of literary art, while taking their stand upon the\r\nsolid earth, have not feared to lift their heads to heaven. The\r\nhighest art is the union of both methods, but in recent times realism\r\nin an extreme form, led by Zola and Tolstoi, and followed with willing\r\nthough infirm footsteps by certain American writers, has attained a\r\nmarked prominence in literature, while romantic writers have suffered\r\na corresponding obscuration. It must be admitted that the influence of\r\nthe realists is not entirely detrimental; on the contrary, they have\r\nimported into literature a nicety of observation, a heedfulness of\r\nworkmanship, a mastery of technique, which have been greatly to its\r\nadvantage. Nevertheless, the novel of hard facts has failed to prove\r\nits claim to infallibility. Facts in themselves are impotent to\r\naccount for life. Every material fact is but the representative on the\r\nplane of sense of a corresponding truth on the spiritual plane. Spirit\r\nis the substance; fact the shadow only, and its whole claim to\r\nexistence lies in its relation to spirit. Bulwer declares in one of\r\nhis early productions that the Ideal is the only true Real.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of things a reaction from the depression of the\r\nrealistic school must take place. Indeed, it has already set in, even\r\nat the moment of the realists' apogee. A dozen years ago the author of\r\n\"John Inglesant,\" in a work of the finest art and most delicate\r\nspirituality, showed that the spell of the ideal had not lost its\r\nefficacy, and the books that he has written since then have confirmed\r\nand emphasized the impression produced by it. Meanwhile, Robert Louis\r\nStevenson and Rider Haggard have cultivated with striking success the\r\nromantic vein of fiction, and the former, at least, has acquired a\r\nmastery of technical detail which the realists themselves may envy. It\r\nis a little more than a year, too, since Rudyard Kipling startled the\r\nreading public with a series of tales of wonderful force and\r\nvividness; and whatever criticism may be applied to his work, it\r\nincontestably shows the dominance of a spiritual and romantic motive.\r\nThe realists, on the other hand, have added no notable recruits to\r\ntheir standard, and the leaders of the movement are losing rather than\r\ngaining in popularity. The spirit of the new age seems to be with the\r\nother party, and we may expect to see them enjoy a constantly widening\r\nvogue and influence.\r\n\r\nThe first practical problem which confronts the intending historian of\r\nan ideal, social, or political community is to determine the locality\r\nin which it shall be placed. It may have no geographical limitations,\r\nlike Plato's \"Republic,\" or Sir Philip Sidney's \"Arcadia.\" Swift, in\r\nhis \"Gulliver's Travels,\" appropriated the islands of the then unknown\r\nseas, and the late Mr. Percy Greg boldly steered into space and\r\nlocated a brilliant romance on the planet Mars. Mr. Haggard has placed\r\nthe scene of his romance \"She\" in the unexplored interior of Africa.\r\nAfter all, if imagination be our fellow-traveller, we might well\r\ndiscover El Dorados within easy reach of our own townships.\r\n\r\nOther writers, like Ignatius Donnelly and Edward Bellamy, have solved\r\nthe problem by anticipating the future. Anything will do, so that it\r\nbe well done. The real question is as to the writer's ability to\r\ninterest his readers with supposed experiences that may develop mind\r\nand heart almost as well as if real.\r\n\r\n\"The Goddess of Atvatabar,\" like the works already mentioned, is a\r\nproduction of imagination and sentiment, the scene of action being\r\nlaid in the interior of the earth. It is true that the notion has\r\nheretofore existed that the earth might be a hollow sphere. The early\r\ngeologists had a theory that the earth was a hollow globe, the shell\r\nbeing no thicker in proportion to its size than that of an egg. This\r\nidea was revived by Captain Symmes, with the addition of polar\r\nopenings. Jules Verne takes his readers, in one of his romances, to\r\nthe interior of a volcano, and Bulwer, in his \"Coming Race,\" has\r\nconstructed a world of underground caverns. Mr. Bradshaw, however, has\r\nswept aside each and all of these preliminary explorations, and has\r\nkindled the fires of an interior sun, revealing an interior world of\r\nstriking magnificence. In view of the fact that we live on an exterior\r\nworld, lit by an exterior sun, he has supposed the possibility of\r\nsimilar interior conditions, and the crudity of all former conceptions\r\nof a hollow earth will be made vividly apparent to the reader of the\r\npresent volume. \"The Goddess of Atvatabar\" paints a picture of a new\r\nworld, and the author must be credited with an original conception. He\r\nhas written out of his own heart and brain, without reference to or\r\ndependence upon the imaginings of others, and it is within the truth\r\nto say that in boldness of design, in wealth and ingenuity of detail,\r\nand in lofty purpose, he has not fallen below the highest standard\r\nthat has been erected by previous writers.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradshaw, in his capacity of idealist, has not only created a new\r\nworld, but has decorated it with the skill and conscientiousness of\r\nthe realist, and has achieved a work of art which may rightfully be\r\ntermed great. Jules Verne, in composing a similar story, would stop\r\nshort with a description of mere physical adventure, but in the\r\npresent work Mr. Bradshaw goes beyond the physical, and has created in\r\nconjunction therewith an interior world of the soul, illuminated with\r\nthe still more dazzling sun of ideal love in all its passion and\r\nbeauty. The story is refreshingly independent both in conception and\r\nmethod, and the insinuation, \"_Beati qui ante nos nostra dixerunt_,\"\r\ncannot be quoted against him. He has imagined and worked out the whole\r\nthing for himself, and he merits the full credit that belongs to a\r\ndiscoverer.\r\n\r\n\"The Goddess of Atvatabar\" is full of marvellous adventures on land\r\nand sea and in the aerial regions as well. It is not my purpose at\r\npresent to enumerate the surprising array of novel conceptions that\r\nwill charm the reader. The author, by the condition of his\r\nundertaking, has given _carte blanche_ to his imagination. He has\r\ncreated a complete society, with a complete environment suited to it.\r\nThe broadest generalization, no less than the minutest particulars,\r\nhave received careful attention, and the story is based upon a\r\nprofound understanding of the essential qualities of human nature, and\r\nis calculated to attain deserved celebrity. Among the subjects dear to\r\nthe idealist's heart, perhaps none finds greater favor than that which\r\ninvolves the conception of a new social and political order, and our\r\nauthor has elaborated this subject on fresh lines of thought, making\r\nhis material world enclose a realm of spiritual tenderness, even as\r\nthe body is the continent and sensible manifestation of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe forces, arts, and aspirations of the human soul are wrought into a\r\nsymmetrical fabric, exhibiting its ideal tendencies. The evident\r\npurpose of the writer is to stimulate the mind, by presenting to its\r\ncontemplation things that are marvellous, noble, and magnificent. He\r\nhas not hesitated to portray his own emotions as expressed by the\r\ncharacters in the book, and is evidently in hearty sympathy with\r\neverything that will produce elevation of the intellectual and\r\nemotional ideals.\r\n\r\nThe style in which the story is told is worthy of remark. In the\r\nbeginning, when events are occurring within the realm of things\r\nalready known or conceived of, he speaks in the matter-of-fact, honest\r\ntone of the modern explorer; so far as the language goes we might be\r\nreading the reports of an arctic voyage as recounted in the daily\r\nnewspaper; there is the same unpretentiousness and directness of\r\nphrase, the same attention to apparently commonplace detail, and the\r\nsame candid portrayal of wonder, hope, and fear. But when the\r\nstupendous descent into the interior world has been made, and we have\r\nbeen carried through the intermediary occurrences into the presence of\r\nthe beautiful goddess herself, the style rises to the level of the\r\nlofty theme and becomes harmoniously imaginative and poetic. The\r\nchange takes place so naturally and insensibly that no jarring\r\ncontrast is perceived; and a subdued sense of humor, making itself\r\nfelt at the proper moment, redeems the most daring flights of the work\r\nfrom the reproach of extravagance.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradshaw is especially to be commended for having the courage of\r\nhis imagination. He wastes no undue time on explanations, but\r\nproceeds promptly and fearlessly to set forth the point at issue.\r\nWhen, for example, it becomes necessary to introduce the new language\r\nspoken by the inhabitants of the interior world, we are brought in\r\nhalf a dozen paragraphs to an understanding of its characteristic\r\nfeatures, and proceed to the use of it without more ado. A more timid\r\nwriter would have misspent labor and ingenuity in dwelling upon a\r\nmatter which Mr. Bradshaw rightly perceived to be of no essential\r\nimportance; and we should have been wearied and delayed in arriving at\r\nthe really interesting scenes.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of the book is worthy of more serious notice. The\r\nreligion of the new race is based upon the worship of the human soul,\r\nwhose powers have been developed to a height unthought of by our\r\nsection of mankind, although on lines the commencement of which are\r\nalready within our view. The magical achievements of theosophy and\r\noccultism, as well as the ultimate achievements of orthodox science,\r\nare revealed in their most amazing manifestations, and with a sobriety\r\nand minuteness of treatment that fully satisfies what may be called\r\nthe transcendental reader. The whole philosophic and religious\r\nsituation is made to appear admirably plausible: but we are gradually\r\nbrought to perceive that there is a futility and a rottenness inherent\r\nin it all, and that for the Goddess of Atvatabar, lofty, wise, and\r\nimmaculate though she be, there is, nevertheless, a loftier and\r\nsublimer experience in store. The finest art of the book is shown\r\nhere: a deep is revealed underneath the deep, and the final outcome is\r\nin accord with the simplest as well as the profoundest religious\r\nperception.\r\n\r\nBut it would be useless to attempt longer to withhold the reader from\r\nthe marvellous journey that awaits him. A word of congratulation,\r\nhowever, is due in regard to the illustrations. They reach a level of\r\nexcellence rare even at this day; the artists have evidently been in\r\nthorough sympathy with the author, and have given to the eye what the\r\nlatter has presented to the understanding. A more lovable divinity\r\nthan that which confronts us on the golden throne it has seldom been\r\nour fortune to behold; and the designs of animal-plants are as\r\nremarkable as anything in modern illustrative art: they are entirely\r\nunique, and possess a value quite apart from their artistic grace.\r\n\r\nThe chief complaint I find to urge against the book is that it stops\r\nlong before my curiosity regarding the contents of the interior world\r\nis satisfied. There are several continents and islands yet to be heard\r\nfrom. But I am reassured by the termination of the story that there is\r\nnothing to prevent the hero from continuing his explorations; and I\r\nshall welcome the volume which contains the further points of his\r\nextraordinary and commendable enterprise.\r\n\r\n                                                    JULIAN HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GODDESS OF ATVATABAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA POLAR CATASTROPHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been asleep when a terrific noise awoke me. I rose up on my\r\ncouch in the cabin and gazed wildly around, dazed with the feeling\r\nthat something extraordinary had happened. By degrees becoming\r\nconscious of my surroundings, I saw Captain Wallace, Dr. Merryferry,\r\nAstronomer Starbottle, and Master-at-Arms Flathootly beside me.\r\n\r\n\"Commander White,\" said the captain, \"did you hear that roar?\"\r\n\r\n\"What roar?\" I replied. \"Where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you must have been asleep,\" said he, \"and yet the roar was\r\nenough to raise the dead. It seemed as if both earth and heaven were\r\nsplit open.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that hissing sound I hear?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"That, sir,\" said the doctor, \"is the sound of millions of flying\r\nsea-fowl frightened by the awful noise. The midnight sun is darkened\r\nwith the flight of so many birds. Surely, sir, you must have heard\r\nthat dreadful shriek. It froze the blood in our veins with horror.\"\r\n\r\nI began to understand that the _Polar King_ was safe, and that we were\r\nall still alive and well. But what could my officers mean by the\r\nterrible noise they talked about?\r\n\r\nI jumped out of bed saying, \"Gentlemen, I must investigate this whole\r\nbusiness. You say the _Polar King_ is safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure, sorr,\" said Flathootly, the master-at-arms, \"the ship lies\r\nstill anchored to the ice-fut where we put her this afthernoon. She's\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\nI at once went on deck. Sure enough the ship was as safe as if in\r\nharbor. Birds flew about in myriads, at times obscuring the sun, and\r\nnow and then we heard growling reverberations from distant icebergs,\r\nanswering back the fearful roar that had roused them from their polar\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe sea, that is to say the enormous ice-pack in which we lay, heaved\r\nand fell like an earthquake. It was evident that a catastrophe of no\r\ncommon character had happened.\r\n\r\nWhat was the cause that startled the polar midnight with such unwonted\r\ncommotion?\r\n\r\nSailors are very superstitious; with them every unknown sound is a cry\r\nof disaster. It was necessary to discover what had happened, lest the\r\ncourage of my men should give way and involve the whole expedition in\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nThe captain, although alarmed, was as brave as a lion, and as for\r\nFlathootly, he would follow me through fire and water like the brave\r\nIrishman that he was. The scientific staff were gentlemen of\r\neducation, and could be relied upon to show an example of bravery that\r\nwould keep the crew in good spirits.\r\n\r\n\"Do you remember the creek in the ice-foot we passed this morning,\"\r\nsaid the captain, \"the place where we shot the polar bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the roar that frightened us came from that locality. You\r\nremember all day we heard strange squealing sounds issuing from the\r\nice, as though it was being rent or split open by some subterranean\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire events of the day came to my mind in all their clearness. I\r\ndid remember the strange sounds the captain referred to. I thought\r\nthen that perhaps they had been caused by Professor Rackiron's shell\r\nof terrorite which he had fired at the southern face of the vast range\r\nof ice mountains that formed an impenetrable barrier to the pole. The\r\nmen were in need of a change of diet, and we thought the surest way of\r\ngetting the sea-fowl was to explode a shell among them. The face of\r\nthe ice cliffs was the home of innumerable birds peculiar to the\r\nArctic zone. There myriads of gulls, kittiwakes, murres, guillemots,\r\nand such like creatures, made the ice alive with feathered forms.\r\n\r\nThe terrorite gun was fired with ordinary powder, and although we\r\ncould approach no nearer the cliffs than five miles, on account of the\r\nsolid ice-foot, yet our chief gun was good for that distance.\r\n\r\nThe shell was fired and exploded high up on the face of the crags. The\r\neffect was startling. The explosion brought down tons of the frosty\r\nmarble. The debris fell like blocks of iron that rang with a piercing\r\ncry on the ice-bound breast of the ocean. Millions of sea-fowl of\r\nevery conceivable variety darkened the air. Their rushing wings\r\nsounded like the hissing of a tornado. Thousands were killed by the\r\nshock. A detachment of sailors under First Officer Renwick brought in\r\nheavy loads of dead fowl for a change of diet. The food, however,\r\nproved indigestible, and made the men ill.\r\n\r\nWe resolved, as soon as the sun had mounted the heavens from his\r\nmidnight declension, to retrace our course somewhat and discover the\r\ncause of the terrible outcry of the night. We had been sailing for\r\nweeks along the southern ice-foot that belonged to the interminable\r\nice hills which formed an effectual barrier to the pole. Day after day\r\nthe _Polar King_ had forced its way through a gigantic floe of\r\npiled-up ice blocks, floating cakes of ice, and along ridges of frozen\r\nenormity, cracked, broken, and piled together in endless confusion. We\r\nwere in quest of a northward passage out of the terrible ice prison\r\nthat surrounded us, but failed to discover the slightest opening. It\r\nhad become a question of abandoning our enterprise of discovering the\r\nNorth Pole and returning home again or abandoning the ship, and,\r\ntaking our dogs and sledges, brave the nameless terrors of the icy\r\nhills. Of course in such case the ship would be our base of supplies\r\nand of action in whatever expedition might be set on foot for polar\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nAbout six o'clock in the morning of the 20th of July we began to work\r\nthe ship around, to partially retrace our voyage. All hands were on\r\nthe lookout for any sign of such a catastrophe as might have caused\r\nthe midnight commotion. After travelling about ten miles we reached\r\nthe creek where the bear had been killed the day before. The man on\r\nthe lookout on the top-mast sung out:\r\n\r\n\"Creek bigger than yesterday!\"\r\n\r\nBefore we had time to examine the creek with our glasses he sung out:\r\n\r\n\"Mountains split in two!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, a dark blue gash ran up the hills to their very summit,\r\nand as soon as the ship came abreast of the creek we saw that the\r\nrange of frozen precipices had been riven apart, and a streak of dark\r\nblue water lay between, on which the ship might possibly reach the\r\npolar sea beyond.\r\n\r\nDare we venture into that inviting gulf?\r\n\r\nThe officers crowded around me. \"Well, gentlemen,\" said I, \"what do\r\nyou say, shall we try the passage?\"\r\n\r\n\"We only measure fifty feet on the beam, while the fissure is at least\r\none hundred feet wide; so we have plenty of room to work the ship,\"\r\nsaid the captain.\r\n\r\n\"But, captain,\" said I, \"if we find the width only fifty feet a few\r\nmiles from here, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must come back,\" said he, \"that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we cannot come back--suppose the walls of ice should begin to\r\nclose up again?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe they will,\" said Professor Goldrock, who was our\r\nnaturalist and was well informed in geology.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"to our certain knowledge this range of ice hills\r\nextends five hundred miles east and west of us. The sea is here over\r\none hundred and fifty fathoms deep. This barrier is simply a\r\ncongregation of icebergs, frozen into a continuous solid mass. It is\r\nquite certain that the mass is anchored to the bottom, so that it is\r\nnot free to come asunder and then simply close up again. My theory is\r\nthis: Right underneath us there is a range of submarine rocks or hills\r\nrunning north and south. Last night an earthquake lifted this\r\nsubmarine range, say, fifty feet above its former level. The enormous\r\nupward pressure split open the range of ice resting thereon, and,\r\nunless the mountains beneath us subside to their former level, these\r\nrent walls of ice will never come together again. The passage will\r\nbecome filled up with fresh ice in a few hours, so that in any case\r\nthere is no danger of the precipices crushing the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your opinion looks feasible,\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said he; \"you will see that the top of the crevasse is wider\r\nthan it is at the level of the water, one proof at least that my\r\ntheory is correct.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor was right; there was a perceptible increase in the width\r\nof the opening at the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I SIGNALLED THE ENGINEER FULL SPEED AHEAD, AND IN A\r\nSHORT TIME WE CROSSED THE ICE-FOOT AND ENTERED THE CHASM.]\r\n\r\nTo make ourselves still more sure we took soundings for a mile east\r\nand west of the chasm, and found the professor's theory of a submarine\r\nrange of hills correct. The water was shallowest right under the gap,\r\nand was very much deeper only a short distance on either side. I\r\nsaid to the officers and sailors: \"My men, are you willing to enter\r\nthis gap with a view of getting beyond the barrier for the sake of\r\nscience and fortune and the glory of the United States?\"\r\n\r\nThey gave a shout of assent that robbed the gulf of its terrors. I\r\nsignalled the engineer full speed ahead, and in a short time we\r\ncrossed the ice-foot and entered the chasm.\r\n\r\nIt could be nothing else but an upheaval of nature that caused the\r\nrent, as the distance was uniform between the walls however irregular\r\nthe windings made. And such walls! For a distance of twenty miles we\r\nsailed between smooth glistening precipices of palaeocrystic ice rising\r\ntwo hundred feet above the water. The opening remained perceptibly\r\nwider at the top than below.\r\n\r\nAfter a distance of twenty miles the height gradually decreased until\r\nwithin a distance of another fifty miles the ice sank to the level of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe sailors gave a shout of triumph which was echoed from the ramparts\r\nof ice. To our astonishment we found we had reached a mighty field of\r\nloose pack ice, while on the distant horizon were glimpses of blue\r\nsea!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF THE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Polar King_, in lat. 84', long. 151' 14\", had entered an ocean\r\ncovered with enormous ice-floes. What surprised us most was the fact\r\nthat we could make any headway whatever, and that the ice wasn't\r\nfrozen into one solid mass as every one expected. On the contrary,\r\nleads of open water reached in all directions, and up those leading\r\nnearest due north we joyfully sailed.\r\n\r\nMay the 10th was a memorable day in our voyage. On that day we\r\ncelebrated the double event of having reached the furthest north and\r\nof having discovered an open polar sea.\r\n\r\nSeated in the luxurious cabin of the ship, I mused on the origin of\r\nthis extraordinary expedition. It was certain, if my father were alive\r\nhe would fully approve of the use I was making of the wealth he had\r\nleft me. He was a man utterly without romance, a hard-headed man of\r\nfacts, which quality doubtless was the cause of his amassing so many\r\nmillions of dollars.\r\n\r\nMy father could appreciate the importance of theories, of enthusiastic\r\nideals, but he preferred others to act upon them. As for himself he\r\nwould say, \"I see no money in it for me.\" He believed that many\r\nenthusiastic theories were the germs of great fortunes, but he always\r\nsaid with a knowing smile, \"You know it is never safe to be a pioneer\r\nin anything. The pioneer usually gets killed in creating an\r\ninheritance for his successors.\" It was a selfish policy which arose\r\nfrom his financial experiences, that in proportion as a man was\r\nselfish he was successful.\r\n\r\nI was always of a totally different temperament to my father. I was\r\nromantic, idealistic. I loved the marvellous, the magnificent, the\r\nmiraculous and the mysterious, qualities that I inherited from my\r\nmother. I used to dream of exploring tropic islands, of visiting the\r\nlands of Europe and the Orient, and of haunting temples and tombs,\r\npalaces and pagodas. I wished to discover all that was weird and\r\nwonderful on the earth, so that my experiences would be a description\r\nof earth's girdle of gold, bringing within reach of the enslaved\r\nmultitudes of all nations ideas and experiences of surpassing novelty\r\nand grandeur that would refresh their parched souls. I longed to\r\nwhisper in the ear of the laborer at the wheel that the world was not\r\nwholly a blasted place, but that here and there oases made green its\r\nbarrenness. If he could not actually in person mingle with its joys,\r\nhis soul, that neither despot nor monopolist could chain, might spread\r\nits wings and feast on such delights as my journeyings might furnish.\r\n\r\nHow seldom do we realize our fondest desires! Just at the time of my\r\nfather's death the entire world was shocked with the news of the\r\nfailure of another Arctic expedition, sent out by the United States,\r\nto discover, if possible, the North Pole. The expedition leaving their\r\nship frozen up in Smith's Sound essayed to reach the pole by means of\r\na monster balloon and a favoring wind. The experiment might possibly\r\nhave succeeded had it not happened that the car of the balloon struck\r\nthe crest of an iceberg and dashed its occupants into a fearful\r\ncrevasse in the ice, where they miserably perished. This calamity\r\nbrought to recollection the ill-fated Sir John Franklin and _Jeanette_\r\nexpeditions; but, strange to say, in my mind at least, such disasters\r\nproduced no deterrent effect against the setting forth of still\r\nanother enterprise in Arctic research.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the expedition I refer to sailed from New York until the\r\nnews of its dreadful fate reached the country, I had been reading\r\nalmost every narrative of polar discovery. The consequence was I had\r\nawakened in my mind an enthusiasm to penetrate the sublime secret of\r\nthe pole. I longed to stand, as it were, on the roof of the world and\r\nsee beneath me the great globe revolve on its axis. There, where there\r\nis neither north, nor south, nor east, nor west, I could survey the\r\nfrozen realms of death. I would dare to stand on the very pole itself\r\nwith my few hardy companions, monarch of an empire of ice, on a spot\r\nthat never feels the life-sustaining revolutions of the earth. I knew\r\nthat on the equator, where all is light, life, and movement,\r\ncontinents and seas flash through space at the rate of one thousand\r\nmiles an hour, but on the pole the wheeling of the earth is as dead as\r\nthe desolation that surrounds it.\r\n\r\nI had conversed with Arctic navigators both in England and the United\r\nStates. Some believed the pole would never be discovered. Others,\r\nagain, declared their belief in an open polar sea. It was generally\r\nconceded that the Smith's Sound route was impracticable, and that the\r\nonly possible way to approach the pole was by the Behring Strait\r\nroute, that is, by following the 170th degree of west longitude north\r\nof Alaska.\r\n\r\nI thought it a strange fact that modern sailors, armed with all the\r\nresources of science and with the experience of numerous Arctic\r\nvoyages to guide them, could get only three degrees nearer the pole\r\nthan Henry Hudson did nearly three hundred years ago. That redoubtable\r\nseaman possessed neither the ships nor men of later voyagers nor the\r\nmany appliances of his successors to mitigate the intense cold, yet\r\nhis record in view of the facts of the case remains triumphant.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that my father died. He left me the bulk of his\r\nproperty under the following clause in his will:\r\n\r\n\"I hereby bequeath to my dear son, Lexington White, the real estate,\r\nstocks, bonds, shares, title-deeds, mortgages, and other securities\r\nthat I die possessed of, amounting at present market prices to over\r\nfive million dollars. I desire that my said son use this property for\r\nsome beneficent purpose, of use to his fellow-men, excepting what\r\nmoney may be necessary for his personal wants as a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nI could scarcely believe my father was so wealthy as to be able to\r\nleave me so large a fortune, but his natural secretiveness kept him\r\nfrom mentioning the amount of his gains, even to his own family. No\r\nsooner did I realize the extent of my wealth than I resolved to devote\r\nit to fitting out a private expedition with no less an object than to\r\ndiscover the North Pole myself. Of course I knew the undertaking was\r\nextremely hazardous and doubtful of success. It could hardly be\r\npossible that any private individual, however wealthy and daring,\r\ncould hope to succeed where all the resources of mighty nations had\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nStill, these same difficulties had a tremendous power of attracting\r\nfresh exploits on that fatal field. Who could say that even I alone\r\nmight not stumble upon success? In a word, I had made up my mind to\r\nset forth in a vessel strong and swift and manned by sailors\r\nexperienced in Arctic voyages, under my direct command. The expedition\r\nwould be kept a profound secret; I would leave New York ostensibly for\r\nAustralia, then, doubling Cape Horn, would make direct for Behring\r\nSea. If I failed, none would be the wiser; if I succeeded, what fame\r\nwould be mine!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBEGINNING THE VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI determined to build a vessel of such strength and equipment as could\r\nnot fail, with ordinary good fortune, to carry us through the greatest\r\ndangers in Arctic navigation. Short of being absolutely frozen in the\r\nice, I hoped to reach the pole itself, if there should be sufficient\r\nwater to float us. The vessel, which I named the _Polar King_,\r\nalthough small in size was very strong and compact. Her length was 150\r\nfeet and her width amidships 50 feet. Her frames and planking were\r\nmade of well-seasoned oak. The outer planking was sheathed in steel\r\nplates from four to six inches in thickness. This would protect us\r\nfrom the edges of the ancient ice that might otherwise cut into the\r\nplanking and so destroy the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe ship was armed as follows: A colossal terrorite gun that stood in\r\nthe centre of the deck, whose 250-pound shell of explosive terrorite\r\nwas fired by a charge of gunpowder without exploding the terrorite\r\nwhile leaving the gun. This was to destroy icebergs and heavy\r\npack-ice. A battery of twelve 100-pounder terrorite guns, with shells\r\nalso fired with powder. All shells would explode by percussion in\r\nstriking the object aimed at. A battery of six guns of the Gatling\r\ntype, to repel boarding parties in case we reached a hostile country.\r\nThere was also an armory of magazine rifles, revolvers, cutlasses,\r\netc., as well as 50 tons of gunpowder, terrorite, and revolver-rifle\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nThe ship was driven by steam, the triple-expansion engine being\r\n500-horse power and the rate of speed twenty-five miles an hour. By an\r\nimportant improvement on the steam engine, invented by myself, one ton\r\nof coal did the work of 50 tons without such improvement. The bunkers\r\nheld 250 tons of coal, which was thus equal to 12,500 tons in any\r\nother vessel. There was also an auxiliary engine for working the\r\npumps, electric dynamo, cargo, anchors, etc. One of the most useful\r\nfittings was the apparatus that both heated the ship and condensed the\r\nsea water for consumption on board ship, and for feeding the boilers.\r\n\r\nThe ship's company was as follows:\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.\r\n\r\nLexington White, Commander of the Expedition.\r\nCaptain, William Wallace.\r\nFirst Officer Renwick, Navigating Lieutenant.\r\nSecond Officer Austin, Captain of the terrorite gun.\r\nThird Officer Haddock, Captain of the main deck battery.\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC STAFF.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rackiron, Electrician and Inventor.\r\nProfessor Starbottle, Astronomer.\r\nProfessor Goldrock, Naturalist.\r\nDoctor Merryferry, Ship's Physician.\r\n\r\nPETTY OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nMaster-at-Arms Flathootly.\r\nFirst Engineer Douglass.\r\nSecond Engineer Anthoney.\r\nPilot Rowe.\r\nCarpenter Martin.\r\nPainter Hereward.\r\nBoatswain Dunbar.\r\n\r\nNinety-five able-bodied seamen, including mechanics, gunners,\r\ncooks, tailors, stokers, etc.\r\n\r\nTotal of ship's company, 110 souls.\r\n\r\nBelieving in the absolute certainty of discovering the pole and our\r\nconsequent fame, I had included in the ship's stores a special\r\ntriumphal outfit for both officers and sailors. This consisted of a\r\nViking helmet of polished brass surmounted by the figure of a\r\nsilver-plated polar bear, to be worn by both officers and sailors. For\r\nthe officers a uniform of navy-blue cloth was provided, consisting of\r\nfrock coat embroidered with a profusion of gold striping on shoulders\r\nand sleeves, and gold-striped pantaloons. For each sailor there was\r\nprovided a uniform consisting of outer navy-blue cloth jacket, with\r\ninner blue serge jacket, having the figure of a globe embroidered in\r\ngold on the breast of the latter, surmounted by the figure of a polar\r\nbear in silver. Each officer and sailor was armed with a cutlass\r\nhaving the figure of a polar bear in silver-plated brass surmounting\r\nthe hilt. This was the gala dress, but for every-day use the entire\r\ncompany was supplied with the usual Arctic outfit to withstand the\r\nterrible climate of high latitudes.\r\n\r\nForeseeing the necessity of pure air and freedom from damp\r\nsurroundings, I had the men's berths built on the spar deck, contrary\r\nto the usual custom. The spar deck was entirely covered by a hurricane\r\ndeck, thus giving complete protection from cold and the stormy weather\r\nwe would be sure to encounter on the voyage.\r\n\r\nOur only cargo consisted of provisions, ship's stores, ammunition,\r\ncoal, and a large stock of chemical batteries and a dynamo for\r\nfurnishing electricity to light the ship. We also shipped largely of\r\nmaterials to manufacture shells for the terrorite guns.\r\n\r\nThe list of stores included an ample supply of tea, coffee, canned\r\nmilk, butter, pickles, canned meats, flour, beans, peas, pork,\r\nmolasses, corn, onions, potatoes, cheese, prunes, pemmican, rice,\r\ncanned fowl, fish, pears, peaches, sugar, carrots, etc.\r\n\r\nThe refrigerator contained a large quantity of fresh beef, mutton,\r\nveal, etc. We brought no luxuries except a few barrels of rum for\r\nspecial occasion or accidents. Exposure and hard work will make the\r\nplainest food seem a banquet.\r\n\r\nThus fully equipped, the _Polar King_ quietly left the Atlantic Basin\r\nin Brooklyn, N. Y., ostensibly on a voyage to Australia. The\r\nnewspapers contained brief notices to the effect that Lexington White,\r\na gentleman of fortune, had left New York for a voyage to Australia\r\nand the Southern Ocean, via Cape Horn, and would be gone for two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWe left on New Year's Day, and had our first experience of a polar\r\npack in New York Bay, which was thickly covered with crowded ice.\r\nGaining the open water, we soon left the ice behind, and, after a\r\nmonth's steady steaming, entered the Straits of Magellan, having\r\ntouched at Monte Video for supplies and water.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Straits we entered the Pacific Ocean, steering north.\r\nTouching at Valparaiso, we sailed on without a break until we arrived\r\nat Sitka, Alaska, on the 1st of March.\r\n\r\nReceiving our final stores at Sitka, the vessel at once put to sea\r\nagain, and in a week reached Behring Strait and entered the Arctic\r\nOcean. I ordered the entire company to put on their Arctic clothing,\r\nconsisting of double suits of underclothing, three pairs of socks,\r\nordinary wool suits, over which were heavy furs, fur helmets,\r\nmoccasins and Labrador boots.\r\n\r\nAll through the Straits we had encountered ice, and after we had\r\nsailed two days in the Arctic Sea, a hurricane from the northwest\r\nsmote us, driving us eastward over the 165th parallel, north of\r\nAlaska. We were surrounded with whirlwinds of snow frozen as hard as\r\nhail. We experienced the benefit of having our decks covered with a\r\nsteel shell. There was plenty of room for the men to exercise on deck\r\nshielded from the pitiless storm that drove the snow like a storm of\r\ngravel before it. Exposure to such a blizzard meant frost-bite,\r\nperhaps death. The outside temperature was 40 below zero, the inside\r\ntemperature 40 above zero, cold enough to make the men digest an\r\nArctic diet.\r\n\r\nWe kept the prow of the ship to the storm, and every wave that washed\r\nover us made thicker our cuirass of ice. It was gratifying to note the\r\ncontrast between our comfortable quarters and the howling desolation\r\naround us.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the storm to subside we had leisure to speculate on\r\nthe chances of success in discovering the pole.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wallace had caused to be put up in each of our four cabins the\r\nfollowing tables of Arctic progress made since Hudson's voyage in\r\n1607:\r\n\r\nRECORD OF HIGHEST LATITUDES REACHED.\r\n\r\nHudson         80' 23\" in 1607\r\nPhipps         80' 48\" in 1773\r\nScoresby       81' 12\" in 1806\r\nPayer          82' 07\" in 1872\r\nMeyer          82' 09\" in 1871\r\nParry          82' 45\" in 1827\r\nAldrich        83' 07\" in 1876\r\nMarkham        83' 20\" in 1876\r\nLockwood       83' 24\" in 1883\r\n\r\n\"Does it not seem strange,\" said I, \"that nearly three hundred years\r\nof naval progress and inventive skill can produce no better record in\r\npolar discovery than this? With all our skill and experience we have\r\nonly distanced the heroic Hudson three degrees; that is one degree for\r\nevery hundred years. At this rate of progress the pole may be\r\ndiscovered in the year 2600.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a record of naval imbecility,\" said the captain; \"there is no\r\nreason why our expedition cannot at least touch the 85th degree. That\r\nwould be doing the work of two hundred years in as many days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not do the work of the next 700 years while we are at it?\" said\r\nProfessor Rackiron. \"Let us take the ship as far as we can go and then\r\nbundle our dogs and a few of the best men into the balloon and finish\r\na job that the biggest governments on earth are unable to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's precisely what we've come here for,\" said I, \"but we must have\r\nprudence as well as boldness, so as not to throw away our lives\r\nunnecessarily. In any case we will beat the record ere we return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOUR ADVENTURES IN THE POLAR SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm lasted four days. On its subsidence we discovered ourselves\r\ncompletely surrounded with ice. We were beset by a veritable polar\r\npack, brought down by the violence of the gale. The ice was covered\r\ndeeply with snow, which made a dazzling scene when lit by the\r\nbrilliant sun. We seemed transported to a new world. Far as the eye\r\ncould see huge masses of ice interposed with floe bergs of vast\r\ndimensions. The captain allowed the sailors to exercise themselves on\r\nthe solidly frozen snow. It was impossible to get any fresh meat, as\r\nthe pack, being of a temporary nature, had not yet become the home of\r\nbear, walrus, or seal.\r\n\r\nWe saw a water sky in the north, showing that there was open water in\r\nthat direction, but meantime we could do nothing but drift in the\r\nembrace of the ice in an easterly direction. In about a week the pack\r\nbegan to open and water lanes to appear. A more or less open channel\r\nappearing in a northeasterly direction, we got the ship warped around,\r\nand, getting up steam, drew slowly out of the pack.\r\n\r\nBirds began to appear and flocks of ducks and geese flew across our\r\ntrack, taking a westerly course. We were now in the latitude of\r\nWrangel Island, but in west longitude 165. We had the good fortune to\r\nsee a large bear floating on an isolated floe toward which we steered.\r\nI drew blood at the first shot, but Flathootly's rifle killed him. The\r\nsailors had fresh meat that day for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe day following we brought down some geese and elder ducks that\r\nsailed too near the ship. We followed the main leads in preference to\r\nforcing a passage due north, and when in lat. 78' long. 150' the watch\r\ncried out \"Land ahead!\" On the eastern horizon rose several peaks of\r\nmountains, and on approaching nearer we discovered a large island\r\nextending some thirty miles north and south. The ice-foot surrounding\r\nthe land was several miles in width, and bringing the ship alongside,\r\nthree-fourths of the sailors, accompanied by the entire dogs and\r\nsledges, started for the land on a hunting expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was a fortunate thing that we discovered the island, for, with our\r\nslow progress and monotonous confinement, the men were getting tired\r\nof their captivity and anxious for active exertion.\r\n\r\nThe sailors did not return until long after midnight, encouraged to\r\nstay out by the fact that it was the first night the sun remained\r\nentirely above the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was the 10th of April, or rather the morning of the 11th, when the\r\nsailors returned with three of the five sledges laden with the spoils\r\nof the chase. They had bagged a musk ox, a bear, an Arctic wolf, and\r\nsix hares--a good day's work. Grog was served all around in honor of\r\nthe midnight sun and the capture of fresh meat. We dressed the ox and\r\nbear, giving the offal as well as the wolf to the dogs, and revelled\r\nfor the next few days in the luxury of fresh meat.\r\n\r\nThe island not being marked on our charts, we took credit to ourselves\r\nas its discoverers, and took possession of the same in the name of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe captain proposed to the sailors to call it Lexington Island in\r\nhonor of their commander, and the men replied to his proposition with\r\nsuch a rousing cheer that I felt obliged to accept the distinction.\r\n\r\nFlathootly reported that there was a drove of musk oxen on the island,\r\nand before finally leaving it we organized a grand hunting expedition\r\nfor the benefit of all concerned.\r\n\r\nLeaving but five men, including the first officer and engineer, on\r\nboard to take care of the ship, I took charge of the hunt. After a\r\nrough-and-tumble scramble over the chaotic ice-foot, we reached the\r\nmainland in good shape, save that a dog broke its leg in the ice and\r\nhad to be shot. Its companions very feelingly gave it a decent burial\r\nin their stomachs.\r\n\r\nMounting an ice-covered hillock, we saw, two miles to the southeast in\r\na valley where grass and moss were visible, half a dozen musk oxen,\r\ndoubtless the entire herd. We adopted the plan of surrounding the\r\nherd, drawing as near the animals as possible without alarming them.\r\nSniffing danger in the southeasterly wind, the herd broke away to the\r\nnorthwest. The sailors jumped up and yelled, making the animals swerve\r\nto the north. A semi-circle of rifles was discharged at the unhappy\r\nbrutes. Two fell dead in their tracks and the remaining four, badly\r\nwounded, wheeled and made off in the opposite direction. The other\r\nwing of the sailors now had their innings as we fell flat and heard\r\nbullets fly over us. Three more animals fell, mortally wounded. A bull\r\ncalf, the only remnant of the herd on its legs, looked in wonder at\r\nthe sailor who despatched it with his revolver. The dogs held high\r\ncarnival for an hour or more on the slaughtered oxen. We packed the\r\nsledges with a carcass on each, and in due time regained the ship,\r\npleased with our day's work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SEMICIRCLE OF RIFLES WAS DISCHARGED AT THE UNHAPPY\r\nBRUTES, AND TWO FELL DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Lexington Island we steered almost due north through a vast\r\nopen pack. On the 1st of May we arrived in lat. 78' 30\" west long.\r\n155' 50\", our course having been determined by the lead of the lanes\r\nin the enormous drifts of ice. Here another storm overtook us,\r\ntravelling due east. We were once more beset, and drifted\r\nhelplessly for three days before the storm subsided. We found\r\nourselves in long. 150' again, in danger of being nipped. The wind,\r\nsuddenly drifting to the east, reopened the pack for us to our intense\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of some fine leads and favorable winds, we passed\r\nthrough leagues of ice, piled-up floes and floebergs, forming scenes\r\nof Arctic desolation beyond imagination to conceive. At last we\r\narrived at a place beyond which it was impossible to proceed. We had\r\nstruck against the gigantic barrier of what appeared to be an immense\r\ncontinent of ice, for a range of ice-clad hills lay only a few miles\r\nnorth of the _Polar King_. At last the sceptre of the Ice King waved\r\nover us with the command, \"Thus far and no further.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWE ENTER THE POLAR GULF.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the _Polar King_ penetrated what appeared an insurmountable\r\nobstacle, and the joyful proof that the hills did not belong to a\r\npolar continent, but were a continuous congregation of icebergs,\r\nfrozen in one solid mass, are already known to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe gallant ship continued to make rapid progress toward the open\r\nwater lying ahead of us. Mid-day found us in 84' 10\" north latitude\r\nand 150' west longitude. The sun remained in the sky as usual to add\r\nhis splendor to our day of deliverance and exultation.\r\n\r\nWe felt what it was to be wholly cut off from the outer world. The\r\nchances were that the passage in the ice would be frozen up solid\r\nagain soon after we had passed through it. Even with our dogs and\r\nsledges the chances were against our retreat southward.\r\n\r\nThe throbbing of the engine was the only sound that broke the\r\nstillness of the silent sea. The laugh of the sailors sounded hollow\r\nand strange, and seemed a reminder that with all our freedom we were\r\nprisoners of the ice, sailing where no ship had ever sailed nor human\r\neye gazed on such a sea of terror and beauty.\r\n\r\nHappily we were not the only beings that peopled the solitudes of the\r\npole. Flocks of gulls, geese, ptarmigan, and other Arctic fowls\r\nwheeled round us. They seemed almost human in their movements, and\r\nwere the links that bound us to the beating hearts far enough off then\r\nto be regretted by us.\r\n\r\nEvery man on board the vessel was absorbed in thought concerning our\r\nstrange position. The beyond? That was the momentous question that lay\r\nlike a load on every soul.\r\n\r\nWhile thinking of these things, Professor Starbottle inquired, if with\r\nsuch open water as we sailed in, how soon I expected to reach the\r\npole.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"we ought to be at the 85th parallel by this time.\r\nFive more degrees, or 300 miles, will reach it. The _Polar King_ will\r\ncover that distance easily in twenty hours. It is now 6 P.M.; at 2\r\nP.M. to-morrow, the 12th of May, we will reach the pole.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Starbottle shook his head deprecatingly. \"I am afraid,\r\ncommander,\" said he, \"we will never reach the pole.\"\r\n\r\nHis look, his voice, his manner, filled me with the idea that\r\nsomething dreadful was going to happen. My lips grew dry with a sudden\r\nexcitement, as I hastily inquired why he felt so sure we would never\r\nreach the object of our search.\r\n\r\n\"What time is it, commander?\" said he.\r\n\r\nI pulled forth my chronometer; it was just six o'clock.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said he, \"look at the sun. The sun has swung round to\r\nthe west, but hasn't fallen any.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the sun, which, sure enough, stood as high as at mid-day.\r\nI was paralyzed with a nameless dread. I stood rooted to the deck in\r\nanticipation of some dreadful horror.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" I gasped, \"what--what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said he, \"the sun is not going to fall again on this course.\r\nIt's we who are going to fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun will fall to its usual position at midnight,\" I stammered;\r\n\"wait--wait till midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun won't fall at midnight,\" said the professor. \"I am afraid to\r\ntell you why,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"In God's name,\" I shouted, \"tell me the meaning of this!\"\r\n\r\nI will never forget the feeling that crazed me as the professor said:\r\n\"I fear, commander, we are falling into the interior of the earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, sir!\" I shouted. \"It cannot be--we are sailing to the\r\nNorth Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait till midnight, commander,\" said he, shaking my hand.\r\n\r\nI took his hand and echoed his words--\"Wait till midnight.\" After a\r\npause I inquired if he had mentioned his extraordinary fears to any\r\none else.\r\n\r\n\"Not a soul,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"say nothing to anybody until midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, sir,\" said he, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe sailors evidently expected that something was going to happen on\r\naccount of the sun standing still in the heavens. They were gathered\r\nin groups on deck discussing the situation with bated breath. I\r\nnoticed them looking at me with wild eyes, like sheep cornered for\r\nexecution. The officers avoided calling my attention to the unusual\r\nsight, possibly divining I was already fully excited by it.\r\n\r\nNever was midnight looked for so eagerly by any mortal on earth as I\r\nawaited the dreadful hour that would either confirm or dispel my\r\nfears.\r\n\r\nMidnight came and the sun had not fallen in the sky! There he stood as\r\nhigh as at noonday, at least five degrees higher than his position\r\ntwenty-four hours before.\r\n\r\nProfessor Starbottle, approaching me, said: \"Commander, my\r\nprognostication was correct; you see the sun's elevation is unchanged\r\nsince mid-day. Now one of two things has happened--either the axis of\r\nthe earth has approached five degrees nearer the plane of its orbit\r\nsince mid-day or we are sailing down into a subterranean gulf! That\r\nthe former is impossible, mid-day to-day will disprove. If my theory\r\nof a subterranean sea is correct, the sun will fall below the horizon\r\nat mid-day, and our only light will be the earth-light of the opposite\r\nmouth of the gulf into which we are rapidly sinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor,\" said I, \"tell the officers and the scientific staff to\r\nmeet me at once in the cabin. This is a tremendous crisis!\"\r\n\r\nEre I could leave the deck the captain, officers, doctor, naturalist,\r\nProfessor Rackiron, and many of the crew surrounded me, all in a state\r\nof the greatest consternation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDAY BECOMES NIGHT AND NIGHT DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Commander,\" said Captain Wallace, \"I beg to report that the pole star\r\nhas suddenly fallen five degrees south from its position overhead, and\r\nthe sun has risen to his mid-day position in the sky! I fear we are\r\nsailing into a vast polar depression something greater than the\r\ndescription given in our geographies, that the earth is flattened at\r\nthe poles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really think, captain,\" I inquired, \"that we are sailing into\r\na hollow place around the pole?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I am sure of it,\" said he. \"Nothing else can explain the sudden\r\nmovement of the heavenly bodies. Remember, we have only passed the\r\n85th parallel but a few miles and ought to have the pole star right\r\noverhead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Starbottle has a theory,\" I said, \"that may account for the\r\nstrange phenomena we witness. Let these gentlemen hear your theory,\r\nprofessor.\"\r\n\r\nThe professor stated very deliberately what he had already\r\ncommunicated to me, viz.: that we were really descending to the\r\ninterior of the earth, that the bows of the ship were gradually\r\npointing to its centre, and that if the voyage were continued we would\r\nfind ourselves swallowed up in a vast polar gulf leading to God knows\r\nwhat infernal regions.\r\n\r\nThe terror inspired by the professor's words was plainly visible on\r\nevery face.\r\n\r\n\"Let us turn back!\" shouted some of the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion,\" said the captain, \"is that we have entered a polar\r\ndepression; it is impossible to think that the earth is a hollow shell\r\ninto which we may sail so easily as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I might venture a remark,\" said Pilot Rowe, \"I think Professor\r\nStarbottle is right. If the earth is a hollow shell having a\r\nsubterranean ocean, we can sail thereon bottom upward and masts\r\ndownward, just as easily as we sail on the surface of the ocean here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe an interior ocean an impossibility,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, sorr,\" said the master-at-arms, \"for what would keep\r\nthe ship sticking to the wather upside down?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TERROR INSPIRED BY THE PROFESSOR'S WORDS WAS\r\nPLAINLY VISIBLE ON EVERY FACE.]\r\n\r\n\"I don't say that the earth is absolutely a hollow sphere,\" said the\r\nprofessor, \"but I do say this, we are now sailing into a polar abyss,\r\nand if the sun disappears at noon to-day it will be because we have\r\nsailed far enough into the gulf to put the ocean over which we have\r\nsailed between us and that luminary. If the sun disappears at noon,\r\ndepend upon it we will never reach the pole, which will forever remain\r\nonly the ideal axis of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say,\" I inquired, \"that what men have called the pole\r\nis only the mouth of an enormous cavern, perhaps the vestibule of a\r\nsubterranean world?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely the theory I advance to account for this strange\r\nending of our voyage,\" said the professor.\r\n\r\nThe murmurs of excitement among the men again broke out into wild\r\ncries of \"Turn back the ship!\"\r\n\r\nI encouraged the men to calm themselves. \"As long as the ship is in no\r\nimmediate danger,\" said I, \"we can wait till noonday and see if the\r\nprofessor's opinion is supported by the behavior of the sun. If so, we\r\nwill then hold a council of all hands and decide on what course to\r\nfollow. Depart to your respective posts of duty until mid-day, when we\r\nwill decide on such action as will be for the good of all.\"\r\n\r\nThe men, terribly frightened, dispersed, leaving Captain Wallace,\r\nFirst Officer Renwick, Professors Starbottle, Goldrock, and Rackiron,\r\nthe doctor and myself together.\r\n\r\nDreadful as was the thought of quietly sinking into a polar gulf from\r\nwhich possibly there might be no escape, yet the bare possibility of\r\nreturning to tell the world of our tremendous discovery created a\r\ndesire to explore still further the abyss into which we had entered. I\r\nconfess that my first feeling of terror was rapidly giving way to a\r\npassion for discovery. What fearful secrets might not be held in the\r\ndarkness toward which we undoubtedly travelled! Would it be our\r\nfortune to pierce the darkness and silence of a polar cavern? When I\r\nthought of the natural terror of the sailors, I dared not think of our\r\nsailing further than mid-day, in case we had really entered an abyss.\r\n\r\n\"Commander,\" said Professor Starbottle, \"this is the most important\r\nday, or rather night, of the voyage. I propose we stay on deck and\r\nenjoy the sunlight as long as we can.\"\r\n\r\nOne glance at the sun sufficed to tell us the truth; he was rapidly\r\nfalling from the sky. At midnight he was 20 degrees and at 1 A.M.\r\nonly 18 degrees above the waste of waters.\r\n\r\nThis proved we were as rapidly taking leave of the glorious orb, on an\r\nexpedition fraught with the greatest peril and unknown possibilities\r\nof science, conquest, and commerce.\r\n\r\nBy a tacit consent we turned our attention to the scene around us. The\r\nwater was very free from ice, only here and there icebergs floated.\r\nThe diminished radiation of light produced a weird effect, growing\r\nmore spectral as the sun sank in the heavens.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goldrock pointed out a flock of geese actually flying ahead\r\nof us into the gulf, if gulf indeed it were. We considered this a good\r\nomen and took heart accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe captain pointed out a strange apparition in the north, but which\r\nwas really south of the pole, and discoverable with the glass. It\r\nappeared to be the limb of some rising planet between us and the sun\r\nthat seemed faintly illuminated by moonlight. Professor Starbottle\r\nsaid it was the opposite edge of the polar gulf that was about to\r\nenvelop us. It was illuminated by the earth-light reflected from the\r\nsame ocean on which the _Polar King_ floated.\r\n\r\nThe sun, as he swung round to the south, fell rapidly to the horizon,\r\nand at eight o'clock disappeared below the water. Was there ever a day\r\nin human experience as portentous as that? When did the sun set at 8\r\nA.M.in the Arctic summer, leaving the earth in darkness? We knew\r\nthen that Professor Starbottle's theory of a polar gulf was a truth\r\nbeyond question. It was a fearful fact!\r\n\r\nBut the grandest spectacle we had yet seen now lay before us. The\r\nopposite rapidly rising limb of the polar gulf, 500 miles away, was\r\nbrilliantly illuminated by the sun's rays far overhead, and its\r\nsplendid earth-light, twenty times brighter than moonlight, falling\r\nupon us, compensated for the sudden obliteration of the daylight.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-day, and our only light was the earth-light of the gulf.\r\nThere stood over us the still rising circular rim of the ocean,\r\nsparkling like an enormous jewel. It was a bewildering experience. In\r\nthe light of that distant ocean I assembled the men on deck and thus\r\naddressed them:\r\n\r\n\"My men, when we started on the present expedition you stipulated for\r\na voyage of discovery to the North Pole (if possible) and return to\r\nNew York again. The first part of the voyage is happily accomplished.\r\nWe alone of all the explorers who have essayed polar discovery have\r\nbeen rewarded with a sight of the pole. The mystery of the earth's\r\naxis is no longer a secret. Here before your eyes is the axis on which\r\nthe earth performs its daily revolution. The North Pole is an immense\r\ngulf 500 miles in diameter and of unknown depth. Within this gulf lies\r\nour ship, at least a hundred miles below the level of the outer ocean!\r\n\r\n\"The question we are now called upon to decide is this: Are we to\r\nremain satisfied with our present achievement, turn back the ship, and\r\ngo home without attempting to discover whither leads this enormous\r\ngulf? As far as the officers of the ship and the scientific staff are\r\nconcerned, as far as I myself am concerned, I am satisfied if we were\r\nonce back in New York again, our first thought would be to return\r\nhither, and, taking up the thread of our journey, endeavor to explore\r\nthe farthest recesses of the gulf.\"\r\n\r\nI was here interrupted by loud applause from the entire officers and\r\nmany of the men.\r\n\r\n\"This being so, why should we waste a journey to New York and back\r\nagain for nothing? Why not, with our good ship well armed and\r\nprovisioned, that has in safety carried us so far, why not, I say,\r\nproceed further, taking advantage of the only opportunity the ages of\r\ntime have ever offered to man to explore earth's profoundest secrets?\r\n\r\n\"Who knows what oceans, what continents, what nations, it may be of\r\nmen like ourselves, may not exist in a subterranean world? Who knows\r\nwhat gold, what silver, what precious stones are there piled perhaps\r\nmountains high? Are we to tamely throw aside the possibility of such\r\nglory on account of base fears, and, returning home, allow others to\r\nsnatch from our grasp the golden prize?\r\n\r\n\"My men, I cannot think you will do this. Our future lies entirely in\r\nyour hands. We cannot proceed further on our voyage without your\r\nassistance. I will not compel a single man to go further against his\r\nwill. I call for volunteers for the interior world! I am willing to\r\nlead you on; who will follow me?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWE DISCOVER THE INTERIOR WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers and sailors responded to my speech with ringing cheers.\r\nEvery man of them volunteered to stay by the ship and continue our\r\nvoyage down the gulf. Whatever malcontents there may have been among\r\nthe sailors, those, influenced by the prevailing enthusiasm, were\r\nafraid to exhibit any cowardice, and all were unanimous for further\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nI signalled our resolution by a discharge of three guns, which created\r\nthe most thrilling reverberations in the mysterious abyss.\r\n\r\nStarting the engine again, the prow of the _Polar King_ was pointed\r\ndirectly toward the darkness before us, toward the centre of the\r\nearth. We were determined to explore the hollow ocean to its further\r\nconfines, if our provisions held out until such a work would be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nWe hoped at midnight to obtain our last look at the sun, as we would\r\nthen be brought into the position of the opposite side of the watery\r\ncrater down which we sailed. At eleven o'clock the sun rose above the\r\nlimb of the gulf, which was now veiled in darkness. We were gladdened\r\nwith two hours of sunlight, the sun promptly setting at 1 A.M. of the\r\nnew day.\r\n\r\nWe continued our voyage in the semi-darkness, the prow of the vessel\r\nstill pointed to the centre of the earth, while the polar star shone\r\nin the outer heavens on the horizon directly over the rail of the\r\nvessel's stern.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear to us that we were dropping straight down into the\r\ninterior of the earth; on the contrary, we always seemed to float on a\r\nhorizontal sea, and the earth seemed to turn up toward us and the\r\npolar cavern to gradually engulf us. The sight we beheld that day was\r\ninexpressibly magnificent. Five hundred miles above us rose the crest\r\nof the circular polar sea. Its upper hemisphere glowed with the light\r\nof the unseen sun. We were surrounded by fifteen hundred miles of\r\nperpendicular ocean, crowned with a diadem of icebergs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THIS MOMENT A WILD CRY AROSE FROM THE SAILORS. WITH\r\nONE VOICE THEY SHOUTED, \"THE SUN! THE SUN!\"]\r\n\r\nGlorious as was the sight, the sailors were terribly apprehensive of\r\nnameless disasters in such monstrous surroundings. It was impossible\r\nfor them to understand how the ocean roof could remain suspended\r\nabove us like the vault of heaven. The idea of being able to sail down\r\na tubular ocean, the antechamber of some infernal world, was\r\nincomprehensible. We were traversing sea-built corridors, whose\r\noscillating floors and roof remained providentially apart to permit us\r\nto explore the mystery beyond.\r\n\r\nMid-day on the 13th of May brought no sight of the sun, but only a\r\ndeepening twilight, the dim reflection of the bright sky we had left\r\nbehind. The further we sailed into the gulf the less its diameter\r\ngrew. When we had penetrated the vast aperture some two hundred and\r\nfifty miles, we found the aerial diameter was reduced to about fifty\r\nmiles, thus forming a conical abyss. We were clearly sailing down a\r\ngigantic vortex or gulf of water, and we began to feel a diminishing\r\ngravity the further we approached the central abyss.\r\n\r\nThe cavernous sea was subject to enormous undulations, or tidal waves,\r\neither the result of storms in the interior of the earth or mighty\r\nadjustments of gravity between the interior and exterior oceans. As we\r\nwere lifted up upon the crest of an immense tidal wave several of the\r\nsailors, as well as the lookout, declared they had seen a flash of\r\nlight, in the direction of the centre of the earth!\r\n\r\nWe were all terribly excited at the news, and as the ship was lifted\r\non the crest of the next wave, we saw clearly an orb of flame that\r\nlighted up the circling undulations of water with the flush of dawn!\r\nWe were now between two spectral lights--the faint twilight of the\r\nouter sun and the intermittent dawn of some strange source of light in\r\nthe interior of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe sailors crowded to the top of both masts and stood upon\r\ncross-trees and rigging, wildly anxious to discover the meaning of the\r\nstrange light and whatever the view from the next crest of waters\r\nwould reveal.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think is the source of this strange illumination,\" I\r\ninquired of the captain, \"unless it is the radiance of fires in the\r\ncentre of the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"It comes from some definite element of fire,\" said the professor,\r\n\"the nature of which we will soon discover. It certainly does not\r\nbelong to the sun, nor can I attribute it to an aurora dependent on\r\nsolar agency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly,\" said Professor Rackiron, \"we are on the threshold of if\r\nnot the infernal regions at least a supplementary edition of the\r\nsame. We may be yet presented at court--the court of Mephistopheles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak idle words, professor,\" said I. \"On the eve of confronting\r\nunknown and perhaps terrible consequences you walk blindfold into the\r\ndesperate chances of our journey with a jest on your lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, commander,\" said he, \"I do not jest. Have not the ablest\r\ntheologians concurred in the statement that hell lies in the centre of\r\nthe earth, and that the lake of fire and brimstone there sends up its\r\nsmoke of torment? For aught we know this lurid light is the reflection\r\nof the infernal fires.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a wild cry arose from the sailors. With one voice they\r\nshouted:\r\n\r\n\"The sun! The sun! The sun!\"\r\n\r\nThe _Polar King_ had gained at last the highest horizon or vortex of\r\nwater, and there, before us, a splendid orb of light hung in the\r\ncentre of the earth, the source of the rosy flame that welcomed us\r\nthrough the sublime portal of the pole!\r\n\r\nAs soon as the astonishment consequent on discovering a sun in the\r\ninterior of the earth had somewhat subsided, we further discovered\r\nthat the earth was indeed a hollow sphere. It was now as far to the\r\ninterior as to the exterior surface, thus showing the shell of the\r\nearth to be at the pole at least 500 miles in thickness. We were half\r\nway to the interior sphere.\r\n\r\nProfessor Starbottle, who had been investigating the new world with\r\nhis glass, cried out: \"Commander, we are to be particularly\r\ncongratulated; the whole interior planet is covered with continents\r\nand oceans just like the outer sphere!\"\r\n\r\n\"We have discovered an El Dorado,\" said the captain, with enthusiasm;\r\n\"if we discover nothing else I will die happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The heaviest elements fall to the centre of all spheres,\" said\r\nProfessor Goldrock. \"I am certain we shall discover mountains of gold\r\nere we return.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we ought to salute our glorious discovery,\" said Professor\r\nRackiron. \"You see the infernal world isn't nearly so bad a place as\r\nwe thought it was.\"\r\n\r\nI ordered a salute of one hundred terrorite guns to be given in honor\r\nof our discovery, and the firing at once began. The echoed roaring of\r\nthe guns was indescribably grand. The trumpet-shaped caverns of water,\r\nboth before and behind us, multiplied the heavy reverberations until\r\nthe air of the gulf was rent with their thunder. The last explosion\r\nwas followed by long-drawn echoes of triumph that marked our\r\nintroduction to the interior world.\r\n\r\nStrange to say that on the very threshold of success there are men who\r\nsuddenly take fright at the new conditions that confront them. It\r\nappeared that Boatswain Dunbar and eleven sailors who had unwillingly\r\nsailed thus far refused to proceed further with the ship, being\r\nterrified at the discovery we had made. I could have obliged them to\r\nhave remained with us, but their reason being possibly affected, I saw\r\nthat their presence as malcontents might in time cause a mutiny, or at\r\nall events an ever-present, source of trouble. They were wildly\r\nanxious to leave the ship and return home; consequently I gave them\r\nliberty to depart. The largest boat was lowered, together with a mast\r\nand sails. I gave the command to Dunbar, and furnished the boat with\r\nample stores and plenty of clothing. I also gave them one-half of the\r\ndogs and two sledges for crossing the ice. When the men were finally\r\nseated Dunbar cast off the rope and steered for the outer sea. We gave\r\nthem a parting salute by firing a gun, and in a short time they were\r\nlost in the darkness of the gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEXTRAORDINARY LOSS OF WEIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thought that occurred to us after the excitement of\r\ndiscovery had somewhat subsided was that the interior of the earth was\r\nin all probability a habitable planet, possessing as it did a\r\nlife-giving luminary of its own, and our one object was to get into\r\nthe planet as quickly as possible. A continual breeze from the\r\ninterior ocean of air passed out of the gulf. Its temperature was much\r\nhigher than that of the sea on which we sailed, and it was only now\r\nthat we began to think of laying off our Arctic furs.\r\n\r\nA closer observation of the interior sun revealed the knowledge that\r\nit was a very luminous orb, producing a climate similar to that of the\r\ntropics or nearly so. As we entered the interior sphere the sun rose\r\nhigher and higher above us, until at last he stood vertically above\r\nour heads at a height of about 3,500 miles. We saw at once what novel\r\nconditions of life might exist under an earth-surrounded sun, casting\r\neverywhere perpendicular shadow, and neither rising nor setting, but\r\nstanding high in heaven, the lord of eternal day. We seemed to sail\r\nthe bottom of a huge bowl or spherical gulf, surrounded by oceans,\r\ncontinents, islands, and seas.\r\n\r\nA peculiar circumstance, first noticed immediately after arriving at\r\nthe centre of the gulf, was that each of us possessed a sense of\r\nphysical buoyancy, hitherto unfelt.\r\n\r\nFlathootly told me he felt like jumping over the mast in his\r\nnewly-found vigor of action, and the sailors began a series of antics\r\nquite foreign to their late stolid behavior. I felt myself possessed\r\nof a very elastic step and a similar desire to jump overboard and leap\r\nmiles out to sea. I felt that I could easily jump a distance of\r\nseveral miles.\r\n\r\nProfessor Starbottle explained this phenomenal activity by stating\r\nthat on the outer surface of the earth a man who weighs one hundred\r\nand fifty pounds, would weigh practically nothing on the interior\r\nsurface of an earth shell of any equal thickness throughout. But the\r\nfact that we did weigh something, and that the ship and ocean itself\r\nremained on the under surface of the world, proved that the shell of\r\nthe earth, naturally made thicker at the equator by reason of\r\ncentrifugal gravity than at the poles, has sufficient equatorial\r\nattraction to keep open the polar gulf. Besides this centrifugal\r\ngravity confers a certain degree of weight on all objects in the\r\ninterior sphere.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get a pair of scales,\" said Flathootly, \"an' see how light I am\r\nin weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind scales,\" said the professor, \"for the weights themselves\r\nhave lost weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm one hundred and seventy-five pounds to a feather,\" said\r\nFlathootly, \"an' I'll soon see if the weights are right or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"The weights are right enough,\" said the professor, \"and yet they are\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' how can a thing be roight and wrang at the same time, I'd loike\r\nto know? We'll thry the weights anyway,\" said the Irishman.\r\n\r\nSo saying, Flathootly got a little weighing machine on deck, and,\r\nstanding thereon, a sailor piled on the weights on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nHe shouted out: \"There now, do you see that? I'm wan hundred and\r\nsiventy-siven pounds, jist what I always was.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the professor, \"you don't seem to understand this\r\nmatter; the weights have lost weight equally with yourself, hence they\r\nstill appear to you as weighing one hundred and seventy-seven pounds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sorr,\" said Flathootly. \"If the weights have lost weight,\r\nthe chap that stole it was cute enough to put it back again before I\r\nweighed meself. Don't you see wid yer two eyes I'm still as heavy as\r\niver I was?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will require ocular demonstration that what I say is correct.\r\nHere, sir, let me weigh you with this instrument,\" said the professor.\r\n\r\nThe instrument referred to was a huge spring-balance with which it was\r\nproposed to weigh Flathootly. One end of it was fastened to the mast,\r\nand to the hook hanging from the other end the master-at-arms secured\r\nhimself. The hand on the dial plate moved a certain distance and\r\nstopped at seventeen pounds. The expression on the Irishman's face was\r\nsomething awful to behold.\r\n\r\n\"Does this machine tell the thruth?\" he inquired in a tearful voice.\r\n\r\nWe assured him it was absolutely correct. He only weighed seventeen\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, howly Mother of Mercy!\" yelled Flathootly. \"Consumption has me by\r\nthe back of the neck. I've lost a hundred and sixty pounds in three\r\ndays. Oh, sir, for the love of heaven, take me back to me mother. I'm\r\nkilt entoirely.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Flathootly could understand that his lightness\r\nof weight was due to the lesser-sized world he was continually\r\narriving upon, together with centrifugal gravity, and that we all\r\nsuffered from his affliction of being each \"less than half a man\" as\r\nhe termed it. The weighing of the weights wherewith he had weighed\r\nhimself proved conclusively that the depreciation in gravity applied\r\nequally to everything around us.\r\n\r\nThe extreme lightness of our bodies, and the fact that our muscles had\r\nbeen used to move about ten times our then weight, was the cause of\r\nour wonderful buoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe sailors began leaping from the ship to a large rock that rose out\r\nof the water about half a mile off. Their agility was marvellous, and\r\nFlathootly covered himself with glory in leaping over the ship\r\nhundreds of feet in the air and alighting on the same spot on deck\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTheir officers and scientific staff remained on deck as became their\r\ndignity, although tempted to try their agility like the sailors.\r\n\r\nFlathootly surprised us by leaping on a yardarm and exclaiming:\r\n\"Gintlemen, I tell ye what it is, I'm no weight at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you make that out?\" said the professor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Oi've been thinking,\" said he, \"that, as you say, we're in the\r\nmiddle of the two wurrlds. Now it stands to sense that the wan wurrld,\r\nI mane the sun up there, is pullin' us up an' the t'other wurrld is\r\npullin' us down, an' as both wurrlds is pulling aqually, why av corse\r\nwe don't amount to no weight at all. How could I turn fifteen\r\nsummersaults at wance if I was any weight? That shows yer weighing\r\nmachine is all wrang again.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you stand on the deck if you are no weight?\" inquired the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I'm only pressing me feet on the boards,\" said the Irishman;\r\n\"look here!\" So saying, he leaped from the yard and revolved in the\r\nair at least twenty times before alighting on the deck.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the professor, \"I'll explain why you only weigh seventeen\r\npounds as indicated by the spring-balance. We have sailed, down the\r\ngulf 500 miles, haven't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yis, sorr.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here we are sailing upside down on the inside roof of the\r\nworld----\"\r\n\r\n\"Sailin' upside down? Indeed, sorr, an' ye can't make me believe that,\r\nfor shure I'm shtandin' on me feet like yourself, head uppermost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, whether you believe it or not, we are sailing upside down, just\r\nas ships going to Australia sail upside down as compared with ships\r\nsailing the North Atlantic. But the point of gravity is this: Here we\r\nare surrounded on all sides by the shell of the earth, which attracts\r\nequally in all directions. Hence all objects in the interior world\r\nhave no weight as regards whatever thickness of the earth's shell\r\nsurrounds them. You see, weight is caused by an object having the\r\nworld on one side of it. Thus both the world and the object attract\r\neach other according to the density and distance apart. What we call a\r\npound weight is a mass of matter attracted by the earth on its surface\r\nwith a force equal to the weight of sixteen ounces. A pound weight on\r\nthe surface of the earth weighs sixteen ounces, and all the mighty\r\nvolume of our planet, with all its mountains, continents and seas,\r\nweighs only sixteen ounces on the surface of a pound weight. The earth\r\nmay still weigh many millions of tons as regards the sun, but as\r\nregards a pound weight it only weighs sixteen ounces.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is an illustration of Flathootly's mental calibre,\" said Captain\r\nWallace. \"He only believes what his brain can accommodate in the way\r\nof knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless the captain,\" said Flathootly, \"I'm shure his brain is as\r\nbig as mine any day in the week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued the astronomer, \"it seems to me that the substances\r\nof the earth, rocks, metals, and water, have, under the influence of\r\ncentrifugal gravity, massed themselves very thickly at the equator or\r\npoint of greatest motion, and stretch toward the poles in a\r\ngradually-lessening mass until the polar gulfs are reached. Thus the\r\nearth's shell resembles a musk-melon with the inside cleaned out.\"\r\n\r\n\"It makes me mouth wather to think of it,\" said Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, listen,\" said the astronomer; \"we are also under the influence\r\nof the earth's centrifugal motion, and wherever we are on the interior\r\nsurface we swing round our circle of latitude in twenty-four hours,\r\nand thus men, ship, and ocean are held up against the interior vault\r\nlike a boy being able to hold water in a vertical position at the\r\nbottom of the pail he swings round him at the end of a cord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, professor,\" I inquired, \"we will become heavier as\r\nwe approach the region of greatest motion under the equator?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" he replied, \"for the ocean around the poles has\r\nnaturally gravitated to the internal as well as to the external\r\nequator, to restore the equilibrium of gravity. The reason why a man\r\ndoes not weigh less on the external equator than at the poles,\r\nalthough flying around at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, is\r\nthat the deeper ocean, that is, the extra twenty-six miles that the\r\nearth is thicker on the equator, counterbalances by its attraction\r\nthe loss of weight due to the rapid centrifugal motion, and so\r\npreserves in all objects on the earth a uniform weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing,\" said Flathootly, \"is as clear as mud. I'm glad to\r\nknow, sorr, I haven't lost me entire constitution at all evints, an'\r\nif I can only carry home what weight I've got lift I'll make a fortune\r\nin a dime museum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nAFLOAT ON THE INTERIOR OCEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the _Polar King_ sped southward over the interior sea the wonders\r\nof the strange world we had discovered began to dawn upon us. The\r\ncolossal vault rose more and more above us and the sun threw his mild\r\nand vertical rays directly upon ship and sea, producing a most\r\ndelightful climate. The ocean had a temperature of 75 degrees Fahr.\r\nand the air 85 degrees. We were absolutely sailing upside down to an\r\ninhabitant of the outer sphere, yet we seemed to ourselves to be\r\nsailing naturally erect on the sea with the sun above us.\r\n\r\nOur first experience in the internal sphere was that of a sudden\r\nstorm. The sun grew dark and appeared like a disc of sombre gold. The\r\nocean was lashed by a furious hurricane into incredible mountains of\r\nwater. Every crest of the waves seemed a mass of yellow flame. The\r\ninternal heavens were rent open with gulfs of sulphur-colored fire,\r\nwhile the thunder reverberated with terrible concussions. The ship\r\nwould spin upon the water as though every wave were a whirlpool. A\r\ngolden-yellow phosphorescence covered the ocean. The water boiled in\r\nmaddening eddies of lemon-colored seas, while from the hurricane decks\r\nstreamed cataracts of saffron fire. The lightning, like streaks of\r\nmolten gold, hurled its burning darts into the sea. Everything bore\r\nthe glow of amber-colored fire. The sailors congratulated themselves\r\non the shelter provided by the deck overhead. The motion of the ship\r\nexceeded all former experiences, for it leaped and plunged in a\r\nterrific manner. It was a question whether we would survive the storm\r\nor not, so violent was the shaking up both ship and men received.\r\nFortunately, the loss of weight in everything, which was the cause of\r\nthe rapid motion, permitted no more damage than would be caused by a\r\nlesser storm on heavier objects.\r\n\r\nThe professor stated that he believed the tempest was occasioned by a\r\npolar tidal wave of air rushing into the interior sphere, to supply\r\nthe exhaustion caused by outgoing warm currents, owing perhaps to a\r\nperiodical overheating of the air by the internal sun. When a certain\r\nvolume of the air was expelled, so that it could no longer resist\r\nexternal pressure, then the external air rushed down the polar gulf,\r\ncreating by meeting warm outward-flowing currents cyclones such as we\r\nwere then experiencing.\r\n\r\nBy degrees the storm abated, the sea grew calm, the heavens above us\r\nbecame clearer, and the sun assumed the rose-color he first presented\r\nto our gaze, standing right in the zenith.\r\n\r\nThe only damage done to the crew was a few broken limbs and some\r\nsevere bruises. The ship had lost several spars, and one of her boats\r\nwas blown out of its lashings on deck and was lost.\r\n\r\nIt was a week since we had left the outer world, and what a change had\r\noccurred in that short space of time! The excitement had been so\r\nintense that not a man of us had slept during that period, and as for\r\nmeals, we had forgotten about them altogether.\r\n\r\nA general order was given the cooks to prepare a banquet to duly\r\ninaugurate our discovery of the new world. Both officers and men,\r\nincluding myself, sat down at the same table, where we satisfied the\r\ncravings of a week's hunger.\r\n\r\nI expressed my heartfelt pleasure in the safety of the crew and ship\r\nso far in making so tremendous a discovery. I relied on the courage\r\nand loyalty of the crew for still further explorations in the strange\r\nand mysterious planet we had discovered. I declared that those who\r\nshared the dangers of the expedition would also share in whatever\r\nreward fortune might bestow upon us.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say such sentiments were enthusiastically applauded.\r\n\r\nI praised my able coadjutor, Captain Wallace, without whose skilful\r\nseamanship not a soul of us could ever have reached that secret world.\r\n\"It was he,\" said I, \"who has guided us without a chart through five\r\nhundred miles of polar cavern to the realms of Pluto, to Plutusia, the\r\ninterior world. On him again we must depend for a safe exit when our\r\nexplorations are ended.\"\r\n\r\nFlathootly attempted to make a speech, but, like the rest of the\r\ncompany, fell asleep, and in less than half an hour afterward not a\r\nsoul remained awake, excepting Professor Starbottle and myself.\r\n\r\nWe both struggled against sleep long enough to take a survey of the\r\ninternal sphere. The _Polar King_ floated on the wide bosom of the sea\r\nunderneath the perpendicular sun that lit all Plutusia with its beams.\r\nWith our telescopes we discovered oceans, continents, mountain ranges,\r\nlakes, cities, railroads, ships, and buildings of all kinds spread\r\nlike an immense map on the concave vault of the earth overhead. It was\r\na sight that alone amply repaid us for the discovery of so sublime a\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nWe thought what a cry of joy would electrify both planets when through\r\nour instrumentality they first knew of each other's existence. We\r\nalone possessed the tremendous secret! Then, what possibilities of\r\ncommerce! What keen and glorious revelations of art! What unfolding of\r\nthe secrets of nature each world would find in the other! What\r\ninventions rival nations would discover in either world, and here for\r\nthe outer world what possible mountains of gold, what quarries of\r\njewels! What means of empire and joy and love! But such thoughts were\r\ntoo vast for wearied souls. We were stunned by such conceptions, and,\r\nyielding to nature, sank into a dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA VISIT FROM THE INHABITANTS OF PLUTUSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow long we slept it is impossible to say. We must have remained in\r\nslumber at least three days after the great excitement of our voyage\r\nso far. The direct cause of my awaking was a loud noise on deck, and\r\non coming up to learn the cause, I saw Flathootly shaking his fist at\r\ntwo strange flying men who hovered over the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Bad luck to ye,\" shouted Flathootly, \"if iver I get a grip of ye\r\nagain you won't sail away so swately after jabbin' me in the neck like\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Flathootly!\" I cried, \"what's the meaning of this? Were those men on\r\nboard ship? Had you hold of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Begorra, sorr,\" he replied, holding his hand over a slight wound in\r\nhis neck, \"I was slaping as swately as a child when I felt something\r\ntickling me nose. I got up to see what was the matther wid me, and\r\nsure enough found thim two rascals prowlin' about the deck. Whin they\r\nsaw me making a move they jumped back and roosted on the rail. I\r\nwanted to catch howlt of wan of thim as a curiosity and I goes up to\r\nthe short fellow, an' says I, quite honey like: 'Good-marnin', sorr!\r\nCould you give me a match to loight me pipe?' an' before the fellow\r\nhad time to know where he was I had howlt of him, wings an' all. Why,\r\nhe was as weak as wather, and I was knocking his head on the deck to\r\nkape him quiet, whin the other fellow let fly and stuck his spear in\r\nme neck, and whin I was trying to catch the second fellow the first\r\nfellow got away. Be jabers, the next time I get the grip on either of\r\nthim his mutton's cooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, Flathootly,\" said I, \"you will never catch either of them\r\nagain. Don't you see they have got wings and can fly wherever they\r\nlike beyond reach?\"\r\n\r\nThe two men that flew around the ship were strange beings. Their\r\ncomplexions were bright yellow and their hair black. They were not\r\nabove five and a half feet in height, but possessed athletic frames.\r\nTheir wings were long polished blades of metal of a gleaming white,\r\nlike gigantic oars, which were moved by some powerful force (possibly\r\nelectricity) quite independent of the body. Their aerial blades\r\nflashed and whirled in the sunlight with blinding rapidity. Their\r\nattire consisted of what appeared to be leather tights covering the\r\nlegs, of a pale yellow tint with crimson metallic embroidery. The\r\ndynamo and wings were fastened to a crimson jacket of unique shape\r\nthat supported the body in flight. Their heads were protected by white\r\nmetal helmets, and they wore tightly-fitting metal boots, reaching\r\nhalf way up to the knee, the metal being arranged in overlapping\r\nscales. Each flying man was armed with a spear and shields. The _tout\r\nensemble_ was a picture of agility and grace.\r\n\r\nThe sailors, now thoroughly awake, gave expression to loud\r\nexclamations of surprise at the sight of the two strange flying men\r\nwheeling around the ship overhead. Professor Starbottle thought that\r\nthe strangers must belong to some wealthy and civilized country, for\r\nmen in a savage state would be incapable of inventing such powers of\r\nflight and presenting so ornate an appearance.\r\n\r\n\"They are soldiers,\" said Professor Rackiron; \"see the spears and\r\nshields they wear.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're bloody pirates!\" said Flathootly. \"It was the long fellow\r\nthat stabbed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're all right,\" said the doctor to Flathootly. \"Thank your stars\r\nthe spear wasn't poisoned, or you would be a dead man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be the powers, I'll have that fellow yet,\" said the master-at-arms.\r\n\"I'm going to take a jump, and, be me sowl, wan of thim fellows 'll\r\nget left.\"\r\n\r\nThe strangers were now flying quite close to the ship, and Flathootly\r\nunexpectedly gave a tremendous spring into the air. He would have\r\ncaught one of the aerial men for certain, but they, having wings,\r\nfoiled him by simply moving out of the line of the Irishman's flight.\r\n\r\nFlathootly dropped into the sea about a quarter of a mile away, and\r\nwould probably have been drowned had it not been for the generosity of\r\nthe strangers themselves. One of the flying men, hastening to the\r\nrescue, caught him by the hair of the head and lifted him out of the\r\nwater. Flathootly caught the stranger by one of his legs and held on\r\nlike grim death. The flying man brought his burden right over the ship\r\nand attempted to drop Flathootly on deck, who shouted, \"I hev him,\r\nboys! I hev him! Catch howlt of us, some of you!\" Immediately a dozen\r\nsailors leaped up, and, grasping the winged man and his burden,\r\nbrought both successfully down to the deck.\r\n\r\nSeeing himself overpowered, the stranger submitted to his captivity\r\nwith as good a grace as possible. We removed his shield and spear,\r\nand, merely tying a rope to his leg to secure our prize, gave him the\r\nfreedom of the ship.\r\n\r\nHe sulked for a long time, and maintained an animated conversation\r\nwith his free companion in a language whose meaning none of us\r\nunderstood. He finally condescended to eat some of the food we set\r\nbefore him, and his companion came near enough to take a glass of\r\nwine from his captive brother and drink it with evident relish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE FLYING MEN CAUGHT FLATHOOTLY BY THE HAIR OF\r\nTHE HEAD, AND LIFTED HIM OUT OF THE WATER.]\r\n\r\nFlathootly was so far friendly disposed to his assailant as to offer\r\nhim a glass of ship's rum. The stranger to our surprise did not refuse\r\nit, but, putting the glass to his lips, quaffed its contents at a\r\nsingle draught. When he became more accustomed to his surroundings we\r\nventured to examine his curious equipment.\r\n\r\nUpon examination we found that the wings of our captive were simply\r\nlarge aerial oars, about four and a half feet in length and three feet\r\nwide at the widest part, tapering down to a few inches wide at the\r\ndynamo that moved them. Such small extent of surface evidently\r\nrequired an enormous force to propel a man in rapid flight. We found\r\nthe dynamo to consist of a central wheel made to revolve by the\r\nattraction of a vast occult force evolved from the contact of two\r\nmetals, one being of a vermilion color and the other of a bright green\r\ntint, that constituted the cell of the apparatus. No acid was\r\nrequired, nor did the contact of the metal produce any wasting of\r\ntheir substance. A colossal current of mysterious magnetism made the\r\nwheel revolve, the current being guided in its work by an automatic\r\ninsulation of one hemisphere of the wheel.\r\n\r\nI put one hand on the dynamo and made a gesture of inquiry with the\r\nother, whereupon our strange friend said, \"Nojmesedi!\" Was this the\r\nname of the new force we had discovered, or the name of the flying\r\napparatus as a whole? Before we could settle the point our friend\r\nbecame communicative, and, smiting his breast, said:\r\n\r\n\"Plothoy, wayleal ar Atvatabar!\"\r\n\r\nWith the right hand he pointed to a continent rising above us, its\r\nmighty features being clearly visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWE LEARN ATVATABARESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exclamation was a very puzzling phrase to us.\r\n\r\nProfessor Starbottle said: \"It appears to me, gentlemen, before we can\r\nmake any use of our prisoner we must first learn his language.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the stranger smote his breast, exclaiming: \"Plothoy, wayleal ar\r\nAtvatabar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of all the lingoes I iver heard,\" said Flathootly, \"this is the\r\nworst case yet. It bates Irish, which is the toughest langwidge to\r\nlarn undher the sun. What langwidge do you call that, sorr?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Goldrock, besides being a naturalist, was an adept in\r\nlanguage. He stated that our captive appeared to be either a soldier\r\nor courier or coast-guard of his country, which was evidently\r\nindicated by the last word, Atvatabar. \"Let us take for granted,\" said\r\nhe, \"that 'Plothoy' is his name and 'Atvatabar' his country. We have\r\nleft the two words 'wayleal ar.' Now the pronunciation and grouping of\r\nthe letters leads me to think that the words resemble the English\r\nlanguage more nearly than any other tongue. The word 'wayleal' has the\r\nsame number of letters as 'soldier' and 'courier,' and I note that the\r\nfourth and last letters are identical in both 'courier' and 'wayleal.'\r\nOn the supposition that both words are identical we might compare them\r\nthus:\r\n\r\nc is w\r\no \" a\r\nu \" y\r\nr \" l\r\ni \" e\r\ne \" i or a\r\nr \" l\r\n\r\nThe word 'wayleil' or 'wayleal' means to us leal or strong--by the\r\nway, a very good name for a soldier.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment our mysterious friend yelled out:\r\n\r\n\"Plothoy, wayleal ar Atvatabar, em Bilbimtesirol!\"\r\n\r\n\"Kape quiet, me boy,\" said Flathootly, \"and we'll soon find out all\r\nabout you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather let him talk away,\" said the professor, \"and we'll find out\r\nwho he is much quicker. You see he has given us two new words this\r\ntime, the words 'em Bilbimtesirol.' Now an idea strikes me--let us\r\ntranspose the biggest word thus:\r\n\r\nb is p\r\ni \" e\r\nl \" r\r\nb \" p\r\ni \" e\r\nm \" n\r\nt \" d\r\ne \" i\r\ns \" c\r\ni \" u\r\nr \" l\r\no \" a\r\nl \" r\r\n\r\nHere we have the word 'perpendicular.' What does 'Bilbimtesirol' as\r\n'perpendicular' mean? It may mean that the interior planet is lit by a\r\nperpendicular sun, and that we are in a land of perpendicular light and\r\nshadow. See how the shadow, of every man surrounds his boots! Now,\r\ngranting 'wayleal' means 'courier' and 'Bilbimtesirol' 'perpendicular,' we\r\nhave a clue to the language of Atvatabar. It seems to me to be a\r\nmiraculous transposition of the English language thus:\r\n\r\na is o\r\nb \" p\r\nc \" s or k\r\nd \" t\r\ne \" i or a\r\nf \" f or v\r\ng \" j\r\nh \" oh\r\ni \" e\r\nj \" g\r\nk \" c\r\nl \" r\r\nm \" n\r\nn \" m\r\no \" a\r\np \" b\r\nq \" v\r\nr \" l\r\ns \" c or s\r\nt \" d\r\nu \" ij\r\nv \" qu\r\nw \" y c or s\r\nx \" z\r\ny \" u or i\r\nz \" x\r\n\r\nAccording to this transposition our friend means, 'Plothoy courier of\r\nAtvatabar, in Bilbimtesirol.' Let us see if we can so understand him.\"\r\nSo saying, the professor approached and said:\r\n\r\n\"Ec wayl moni Plothoy?\" (Is your name Plothoy?)\r\n\r\n\"Wic cel, ni moni ec Plothoy\" (Yes, sir, my name is Plothoy), promptly\r\nreplied the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said the professor; \"that's glorious! We understand each other\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nI congratulated the professor on his brilliant discovery. It was\r\nmagnificent! We could now converse with our prisoner on any subject we\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nWe had the key in our hands that would unlock the wonders of Plutusia,\r\nor rather Bilbimtesirol, the interior world.\r\n\r\nFlathootly turned a dozen summersaults in the air to express his\r\ndelight. The sailors spun upon the deck, and threw each other into the\r\nair like jugglers playing with balls, in pure excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Ec Atvatabar dofi moni ar wail saimtle?\" (Is Atvatabar the name of\r\nyour country?) inquired the professor of Plothoy.\r\n\r\n\"E on o wayleal ar Fec Nogicdi, Cemj Aldemegry Bhoolmakar ar\r\nAtvatabar\" (I am a wayleal of his majesty King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar of\r\nAtvatabar), said Plothoy.\r\n\r\nAtvatabar, then, was a kingdom. We should go there certainly and see\r\nKing Bhoolmakar and his people. But where was this mysterious country?\r\n\r\n\"Yohili ec Atvatabar?\" we asked of Plothoy.\r\n\r\n\"Dohili!\" he replied, pointing to a continent in the southwest. The\r\nsouthwest in the interior world, it should be stated, corresponds to\r\nthe southeast on the outer earth. Atvatabar, then, lay underneath the\r\nAtlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Yohod ec dohi moni ar dohi miolicd gliod sedi?\" (What is the name of\r\nthe nearest great city?) we asked.\r\n\r\n\"Kioram,\" replied Plothoy. \"Dohili ed ec fequi ohymtlit neric tyi\r\ncaydoh docd.\" (There it is, five hundred miles due southeast.)\r\n\r\nWe looked in the direction indicated with our glasses and plainly saw\r\nthe white marble buildings of a large city not three degrees above the\r\nplane of our position. Further off, in the haze of distance, a mighty\r\ncontinent unrolled its landscapes, until it was merged in the\r\nbrightness of the sunlight above us.\r\n\r\nAll this time Plothoy's companion circumnavigated the ship on his\r\nswift wings. We inquired his name.\r\n\r\n\"Lecholt,\" said Plothoy, \"omt ohi orca ec o wayleal.\" (And he also is\r\na wayleal.)\r\n\r\n\"What is the name of the sun above us?\" we inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Swang,\" said Plothoy.\r\n\r\nGood! we would sail direct to Kioram, the principal port of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nI assured Plothoy that as long as he was detained by us he would\r\nreceive the greatest consideration at our hands. We would do him no\r\ninjury, but, on the contrary, amply reward him for his services. He\r\ncould understand that, being strangers in an unknown world, it was\r\nabsolutely necessary for us to have a pilot, or guide, not merely to\r\nadvise how to direct the ship, but to inform us regarding the laws,\r\nmanners, and customs of the people we proposed visiting, that we might\r\naccommodate ourselves to such novel experiences as we were certain to\r\nundergo. We told him we had come to Bilbimtesirol as pioneers of the\r\nouter planet, as heralds of the intercourse that would undoubtedly\r\ntake place between two worlds separated for ages until now. We assured\r\nPlothoy how indebted we were to him for the information he had already\r\ngiven, and his great importance to us in a voyage that would affect\r\nthe interests of thousands of millions of men ought to reconcile him\r\nto his brief captivity. We could not afford to lose him, and therefore\r\nasked him to remain with us for the remainder of the voyage, and on\r\nreaching Kioram we would give him his liberty.\r\n\r\nThese words, with the treatment he was receiving, completely\r\nreconciled Plothoy, who called Lecholt to come down on deck beside\r\nhim. His companion obeyed, and presently the two strangers sat on the\r\nrail of the vessel engaged in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\nPresently Plothoy said that his companion Lecholt would go forward in\r\nadvance of the ship to inform the king of our coming, that due\r\npreparations be made for our reception. This was an admirable\r\nsuggestion, and accordingly we despatched Lecholt with a message of\r\nprofound respect for King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar, saying that the\r\ncommander of the _Polar King_ with his officers and retinue would do\r\nthemselves the honor of visiting his majesty and people as soon as the\r\n_Polar King_ would reach Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nPoising himself for a moment on his wings, Lecholt saluted us with his\r\nsword and immediately swept away in the direction of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWE ARRIVE AT KIORAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the time of departure of Lecholt and our arrival at Kioram we\r\nkept Plothoy as busy as possible answering our questions.\r\n\r\nWe found that all the soldiers of the king were known as wayleals, and\r\nthat all were equipped with magnetic wings. The wings were worked by a\r\nlittle dynamo supplied by magnicity. A single cell, six cubic inches\r\nin size, produced a current both enormously powerful and constant. I\r\ncould recollect no cell in the outer world of the same size so\r\npowerful, hence here was an inventive discovery of the first\r\nimportance. The cell was composed of two metals, terrelium, a\r\nvermilion metal found only in Atvatabar, and aquelium, a bright green\r\nmetal elaborated from the waters of the internal ocean, which metals\r\nsimply placed in contact, without the addition of an acid or alkaline\r\nsalt, generated a powerful current. Both cell and dynamo were strapped\r\nto the back by a strong leathern jacket, which also supported the\r\nsoldier in flight. The weight of a man being only fifteen pounds on\r\nthe surface of the interior earth, and no weight at all fifty miles\r\nabove it, prevented any fatigue being experienced from flight. It was\r\nthe easiest of all methods of locomotion, and eminently suited to the\r\ninhabitants of such a world as Bilbimtesirol.\r\n\r\nPlothoy informed us that the government of Atvatabar was an elective\r\nmonarchy. The king and nobles were elected for life and no title was\r\nhereditary. There was a legislative assembly founded on the popular\r\nwill called the Borodemy. The king's palace and Borodemy were situated\r\nin Calnogor, the capital city of the realm, which lay five hundred\r\nmiles inland and communicated with Kioram by a sacred railroad, as\r\nwell as by aerial ship.\r\n\r\nThe largest building in Calnogor was the Bormidophia, or pantheon,\r\nwhere the worship of the gods was held. The only living object of\r\nworship was the Lady Lyone, the Supreme Goddess of Atvatabar. There\r\nwere different kinds of golden gods worshipped, or symbols that\r\nrepresented the inventive forces, art, and spiritual power.\r\n\r\nThe king was head of the army and navy and the people were divided\r\ninto several classes of nobles and common people. The Atvatabarese\r\nwere very wealthy, gold being as common as iron in the outer world.\r\nThey were a peaceful people, and Atvatabar being itself an immense\r\nisland continent, lying far from any other land, there had been no\r\nwars with any external nation, nor even civil war, for over a hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of newspapers, and the most wonderful inventions had\r\nbeen in use for ages. Railroads, pneumatic tubes, telegraphs,\r\ntelephones, phonographs, electric lights, rain makers, seaboots,\r\nmarine railroads, flying machines, megaphones, velocipedes without\r\nwheels, aerophers, etc., were quite common, not to speak of such\r\ninventions as sowing, reaping, sewing, bootblacking and knitting\r\nmachines. Of course printing, weaving, and such like machines had been\r\nin use since the dawn of history. Strange to say they had no steam\r\nengines, and terrorite and gunpowder were unknown. Their great source\r\nof power was magnicity, generated by the two powerful metals terrelium\r\nand aquelium, and compressed air their explosive force.\r\n\r\nAs we approached this wonderful country we noticed a number of\r\nsplendid ships coming to meet us. Plated with gold and fully rigged,\r\nthey presented a beautiful appearance. They were each propelled by\r\nmagnicity. Plothoy said they were the fleet of Atvatabar coming to\r\nwelcome us. The royal navy was in command of Admiral Jolar, who had\r\nnever yet seen active service, but was a worthy representative of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nOur rapid steaming in the direction of the fleet, which as rapidly\r\napproached us, soon brought the _Polar King_ within range of their\r\nguns. Plothoy was set free, as we then knew all about Atvatabar\r\nnecessary to know prior to seeing the admiral, who could give us more\r\ndefinite information.\r\n\r\nA roar of guns saluted us from at least one hundred vessels. There was\r\nno smoke, the guns being discharged by compressed air. Each vessel\r\nbore the flag of Atvatabar, a pink-colored disc surrounded by a circle\r\nof green on a violet field. The disc represented the sun above us, the\r\ngreen circle Atvatabar, and the violet field the surrounding sea. From\r\nthe peak of the _Polar King_ the American flag floated, the first flag\r\nof the outer sphere that was ever unrolled in the air of the interior\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe ships approached us in double column and presented an appearance\r\nof the utmost grandeur. It was evident we were the discoverers of a\r\npowerful and opulent country, and not a barbarous land. Here were\r\ncivilization and courtesy, and, not to be outdone in these qualities,\r\nI ordered a salute from our terrorite guns. The explosive shells\r\ndischarged by gunpowder into the sea sent up columns of water and foam\r\nall around us to an astonishing height, and it took a considerable\r\ntime for the sea to subside, the gravity of the water being only\r\none-tenth that of the external ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Atvatabarese must have been greatly astonished at the explosions,\r\nas Plothoy informed us that no such weapon as ours formed part of the\r\narmament of the Atvatabar navy.\r\n\r\nThe fleet ceased firing, and presently a gayly-decorated magnic launch\r\nshot off from the flagship, bearing two officers in brilliant\r\nuniforms. Plothoy, as the boat approached us, said the officers were\r\nAdmiral Jolar of the fleet and Koshnili, Grand Minister of the\r\ngovernment. The boat came alongside the _Polar King_, and, lowering a\r\ngangway, the illustrious visitors came on board.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Jolar was arrayed in an olive-green coat, decorated with\r\noverlapping scales of gold embroidery, and olive-green trousers with\r\nan outer stripe similarly decorated. The uniform of Koshnili, the\r\nGrand Minister, was of electric-blue cloth covered with serpentine\r\nbands of gold embroidery, radiating downward. A small but brilliant\r\nretinue accompanied each official. As the distinguished visitors\r\nstepped on deck, the entire fleet saluted us with a second roar of\r\nguns. Plothoy announced their names and dignities. Being able to greet\r\ntheir excellencies in their own language greatly astonished them.\r\n\r\nI learned from the admiral that the Grand Minister Koshnili was sent\r\nby his majesty, King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar, as a special envoy to bid\r\nus welcome in the name of the king and people of Atvatabar. The story\r\ntold by Lecholt had been proclaimed by royal authority throughout the\r\ncountry, and the day of our arrival in Calnogor, the metropolis, was\r\nto be observed as a national holiday.\r\n\r\nA brilliant programme of entertainment had been devised, calculated to\r\ndo us infinite honor. I conferred on Admiral Jolar the title of\r\nHonorary Commander of the _Polar King_, and on Koshnili that of\r\nHonorary Captain.\r\n\r\nThe admiral said that both he and Koshnili would remain on our ship\r\nuntil we arrived in the city of Kioram.\r\n\r\nThe admiral, by signalling from the _Polar King_, put his navy into a\r\nseries of brilliant evolutions. A curious feature was the fact that\r\neach sailor possessed wings, was in fact a wayleal, like Plothoy. The\r\nsailors, wing-jackets or fletyemings, as they were called, of one\r\nvessel, would rise like a swarm of bees and settle on another vessel.\r\nThe evolutions made in this way were both majestic and surprising.\r\n\r\nThe entire fletyemings of each squadron on either side of us were\r\ndrawn up in battle array in the space between the ships and fought\r\neach other in mock battle with spears, while the ships discharged\r\ntheir guns at each other.\r\n\r\nWe reached the harbor of Kioram, in which the royal navy anchored in\r\ndouble column. The _Polar King_ sailed slowly down the imperial avenue\r\nof ships amid the thunder of guns and the cheers of fletyemings.\r\n\r\nThe sun shone gloriously as we stepped from the deck of the ship upon\r\nthe white marble city wharf. Everything was new, strange, and\r\nsplendid. We were received by Governor Ladalmir, of Kioram, the\r\ncommandant of the fort, and his staff, Captains Pra and Nototherboc.\r\nBeyond the notables a vast crowd of Atvatabarese cheered us\r\nvociferously, while the guns of the fort, on a commanding height,\r\nroared their welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMARCHING IN TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a blaze of excitement in the streets of Kioram when our\r\nprocession appeared on the grand boulevard leading from the harbor to\r\nthe fortress, some four miles in length. We presented a strange\r\nappearance not only to the people of the city, but to ourselves as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nPrior to our appearance before the people we were obliged to adjust\r\nourselves to the motion of an immense walking machine, the product of\r\nthe inventive skill of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ladalmir explained that the cavalry of Atvatabar were mounted\r\non such locomotive machines, built on the plan of immense ostriches,\r\ncalled bockhockids. They were forty feet in height from toe to head,\r\nthe saddle being thirty feet from the ground. The iron muscles of legs\r\nand body, moved by a powerful magnic motor inside the body of the\r\nmonster, acted on bones of hollow steel. Each machine was operated by\r\nthe dynamo in the body, which was adjusted to act or remain inert, as\r\nrequired, when riding the structure. A switch in front of the saddle\r\nset the bockhockid in motion or brought it to rest again. It was\r\nsimply a gigantic velocipede without wheels. \"We'll ride the bastes,\"\r\nsaid Flathootly, with suppressed excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can accommodate yourselves to ride such a machine?\"\r\nsaid the governor. \"You will find it, after a little practice, an\r\nimposing method of travel.\"\r\n\r\nWe were assembled in a spacious court that surrounded the private dock\r\nof the king. Into this dock the _Polar King_ had been brought for\r\ngreater safety and also to facilitate popular inspection. I determined\r\nthat both officers and sailors should equally take part in the honors\r\nof our reception, and I informed the governor that we would like to\r\nsee first how the machines were worked.\r\n\r\nAt a signal from the governor, Captains Pra and Nototherboc\r\ndisappeared and presently returned to the court-yard mounted on two\r\ngigantic bockhockids, on which they curvetted and swept around in\r\ngallant style.\r\n\r\nWe were both astonished and delighted at the performance. It was\r\nmarvellous to see such agility and obedience to the wish of the rider\r\non such ungainly monsters. The sailors were only too anxious to mount\r\nsuch helter-skelters as the machine ostriches of Atvatabar. The stride\r\nmade by each bird was over forty feet, and nothing on earth could\r\novertake such coursers in full flight.\r\n\r\nThe governor, proud of his two-legged horses, as he called them, grew\r\neloquent in their behalf.\r\n\r\n\"Consider an army of men,\" said he, \"mounted on such machines. How\r\nswift! How formidable! What a terrible combat when two such armies\r\nmeet, armed with their magnic spears! What display of prodigious\r\nagility! What breathless swerving to and fro! What fearful fleetness\r\nof pursuer and pursued! Aided as we are by the almost total absence of\r\ngravity, our inventors have produced a means of locomotion for\r\nindividual men second only to the flying motor. We possess, also,\r\nflying bockhockids who are our cavalry in aerial warfare.\"\r\n\r\nThe enraptured sailors were only too anxious to mount the enormous\r\nbirds and sally forth to electrify the city. Ninety-eight bockhockids\r\nwere required to mount the entire company. This number was brought\r\ninto the court-yard by a detachment of soldiers who nimbly unseated\r\nthemselves and slid down the smooth legs of the birds to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I say, yer honor,\" said Flathootly to the governor, \"have you any\r\ninsurance companies in this counthry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, certainly,\" replied the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Then I want to inshure my loife if I have to mount a baste loike\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll see that you are amply compensated for any injuries you may\r\nsustain by falling off the machine,\" said the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Sorr, is yer word as good as yer bond?\" inquired Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Well thin, sorr, gimme yer bond,\" said Flathootly.\r\n\r\nThe governor duly put his signature to a statement that Flathootly\r\nshould be compensated for any injuries received in consequence of his\r\nriding the bockhockid. Flathootly carefully deposited the document in\r\na little satchel he carried in his breast, and thereupon, sailor\r\nfashion, climbed up the leg of the machine and seated himself on the\r\ngold-embroidered saddle-cloth.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the sailors got seated on their machines, the entire\r\ncompany forming an imposing phalanx. I found it quite easy to balance\r\nmyself on the two-legged monsters in consequence of the large base\r\ngiven each leg by the outspreading toes.\r\n\r\nWhile the sailors were getting seated a military band, composed of\r\nfifty musicians, each mounted on a bockhockid, played the March of\r\nAtvatabar in soul-stirring strains.\r\n\r\nThe word of command being given, the great doors of the court-yard\r\nwere flung open and forth issued the musicians with banners flying.\r\nThen followed the seamen of the _Polar King_, led by the governor,\r\nKoshnili and myself.\r\n\r\nThe excited populace cheered a hearty welcome. A brigade of five\r\nthousand bockhockids fell into line as an escort of honor. The\r\never-shining sun lent a brilliant effect to the pageant. Our\r\ncomplexions were lighter than those of the Atvatabarese, who were\r\nuniversally of a golden-yellow tint, and it was surprising to see how\r\nfair the people appeared, considering that they lived in a land where\r\nthe sun never sets. None had a complexion darker than a rich\r\nchocolate-brown color. This was accounted for by the fact that the\r\nlight of Swang was not half as intense as that of the outer sun in the\r\ntropics. The diminutive size of the luminary counterbalanced its\r\nproximity to the surrounding planet. The light that fell upon\r\nAtvatabar was warm, genial, glowing, and rosy, imparting to life a\r\ndelightful sensation. As the procession advanced we saw splendid\r\nemporiums of trade chiselled of white marble, crowded roof and window\r\nwith dense masses of people. On either side of the fine boulevard\r\nleading to the palace the people were jammed into an immovable mass\r\nand were wild with enthusiasm. The roadway was lined with trees that\r\nseemed like magnolias, oranges, and oleanders.\r\n\r\n\"Now this is something loike a recipshon,\" said Flathootly. \"I'm well\r\nplazed wid it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am delighted to know that your honor thinks so highly of our\r\nefforts to please you,\" said the governor.\r\n\r\nFlathootly turned round and shouted to the sailors, \"Remimber, me\r\nbhoys, we will hev a grand feast at the ind of the performance.\" As he\r\nspoke, he unfortunately touched the switch starting the bockhockid\r\ninto a gallop, and in a moment the machine dashed furiously forward,\r\nrunning into the musicians, knocking down some of the other\r\nbockhockids, scattering others in all directions, and then flying\r\nahead amid the roars of the people. Flathootly was thrown off his\r\nseat, but in falling to the ground managed to get hold of the\r\nbockhockid's leg at the knee-joint, to which he clung with the energy\r\nof despair. A squad of police, who also rode bockhockids, dashed after\r\nthe flying Flathootly, and one of them got hold of the switch on the\r\nback of the machine and so brought it to a standstill.\r\n\r\nFlathootly was terrified, but uninjured. His first concern was to see\r\nif his \"insurance\" was safe. He found the document still in his\r\nbreast, and this being so, was induced to remount his steed. \"I hope\r\nyour honor has met with no accident?\" said the governor, riding up.\r\n\r\n\"As long as I've yer honor's handwritin' I'm all right,\" said\r\nFlathootly. \"If I break me leg what odds, so long as I'm insured?\"\r\n\r\nThe scattered musicians were assembled in order again and the\r\nprocession continued its way toward the palace. There were on all\r\nsides evidences of wealth, culture, and refinement. Every building was\r\nconstructed of chiselled marble.\r\n\r\nThe fortress and palace of Kioram stood in a large square, occupying\r\nthe most commanding position in the city. From the fort could be seen\r\nthe white shores and surrounding sea of Atvatabar. The harbor was\r\nsurrounded with white stone piers lined with the commerce of the\r\nkingdom. The charm of the scene was largely lost on Flathootly and the\r\nsailors, who cared more for the material benefit of their reception\r\nthan for its ideal beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE MOUNTED POLICE GOT HOLD OF THE SWITCH ON THE\r\nBACK OF THE BOCKHOCKID, AND BROUGHT IT TO A STANDSTILL.]\r\n\r\nThe procession arrived at a pillared archway leading underneath the\r\nsolid walls of the fortress. These walls were fully one hundred feet\r\nin height and fifty feet in thickness. The top of the walls consisted\r\nof a level circular roadway, whereon a guard of bockhockids constantly\r\nswept around with amazing swiftness.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight grotesque in the extreme. The flying wayleals looked\r\nlike a race between enormous ostriches with a wild confusion of legs\r\non the lofty ramparts.\r\n\r\n\"Flying divils let loose,\" was the subdued remark of Flathootly.\r\n\r\nThere was a gay time in the banqueting hall of the palace. We were\r\nroyally feasted, and for wine we drank squang, the choicest wine of\r\nAtvatabar.\r\n\r\nThe governor informed us that our appearance in the interior world had\r\nbeen heralded all over the country, and strange speculations had been\r\nmade as to what world or country we belonged to. \"We know, of course,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that you do not belong to any race of men in our sphere, and\r\nthis makes public curiosity all the greater concerning you. What\r\ncountry do you come from?\" said he, addressing Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"Oi'm from the United States, the foinest counthry on the outside of\r\nthe world; but I was born in Tipperary,\" said Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the governor, \"I should be delighted to visit your\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might be gettin' frightened, sorr, at the dark ivery noight,\"\r\nsaid Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"What is the night?\" said the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Och, and have ye lived to be a gray-haired man and don't know that\r\nit's dark at noight whin the sun jumps round to the other soide of the\r\nwurrld?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's never dark here,\" said the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Thrue for you, but it ought to be. How can a Christian slape wid the\r\nsun shinin' all the toime?\" rejoined the Irishman.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can sleep here in the sunshine,\" said the governor, \"as well\r\nas inside the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it iver rain here?\" said Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"But little,\" replied the governor; \"not more than six inches of rain\r\nfalls in a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bedad, you ought to be in Oireland to see it rain. There you'd git\r\nsoaked to your heart's content. An' tell me how do you grow your\r\ncabbages without rain?\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the governor, \"rain is produced by firing into the air\r\nballs of solid gas so intensely cold that in turning to the gaseous\r\nform they condense in rain the invisible vapor in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bedad, that's what they do in our country,\" said Flathootly, \"only\r\nthey explode shells of dynamite in the air. Can you tell me,\" he\r\nadded, \"have you got tides in the say here?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have never been able to discover what force it is that lifts the\r\nsea so regularly,\" said the governor. \"We call it the breathing of the\r\nocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure any schoolboy knows it's the moon that does it,\" replied\r\nFlathootly.\r\n\r\n\"The moon?\" queried the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of coorse it's the moon on the other side of the wurrld that\r\nlifts up the wather both inside and out. Ye're wake in geography not\r\nto know that,\" said Flathootly.\r\n\r\nThe governor looked at me for verification of this astonishing story.\r\n\"Where is that wonderful moon,\" he inquired, \"that I hear of? Where is\r\nthe surface of the earth that slopes away out of sight?\" Just then the\r\nbell sounded its message that called the people to rest, and the\r\nbanqueting came to an end. We were forthwith shown to the private\r\napartments allotted to us in the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY TO CALNOGOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in Kioram a temple dedicated to the god Rakamadeva, or\r\nSacred Locomotive, which was one of the many gods worshipped by the\r\nAtvatabarese. It belonged to the gods embraced in the category of\r\n\"gods of invention,\" and its motive power was magnicity, the same\r\nforce that propelled the flying men. It was a powerful structure built\r\nof solid gold, platinum, terrelium, aquelium, and plutulium, and\r\nalloys of the most precious and heaviest of metals, and was both car\r\nand locomotive, and was hung over a single elevated rail that\r\nsupported it, the weight resting on six wheels in front and six\r\nbehind, all concealed by the body of the car.\r\n\r\nThe battery consisted of one hundred cells of terrelium and aquelium\r\nthat developed a gigantic force. The six driving wheels at either end\r\nof the car were of immense size, and the tires were hollowed out with\r\na semi-circular groove that fitted upon the high rounded rail. On this\r\nrail rested the entire weight of the car, which oscillated as it\r\nrushed. The end of each projecting head was inlaid with an enormous\r\nruby, and the framework of the god was enriched in numerous places\r\nwith precious stones. The sacred locomotive had as attendants\r\ntwenty-four priests, clad in flowing vestures of orange and aloe-green\r\nsilk (the royal colors), arranged in alternate stripes of great width,\r\ntypical of a green earth and golden sky.\r\n\r\nRoyal and privileged travellers were alone permitted to harness the\r\ngod, and by command of the king we were to enter Calnogor by means of\r\nthe sacred courier.\r\n\r\nThe route to the temple led through a different part of the city than\r\nthat traversed by us when going to the governor's palace. We had\r\nleisure to observe more particularly the architecture and the\r\nappearance of the streets through which we passed. The roadway\r\neverywhere was one solid block of white marble, and emporiums and\r\ndwellings were built of the same material.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have sculptured the city out of a mountain of white\r\nmarble,\" I said to the governor, who rode his bockhockid alongside\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n\"That is, indeed, the fact,\" replied the governor. \"The entire city\r\nhas been laboriously hewn from an immense mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in building your houses, you laid the foundation with the roof,\r\nand built them downward until you arrived at the level of the street,\"\r\nI said.\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely so,\" said he. \"Our streets are simply ornamental\r\nchasms cut in the solid rock. Both roadway and building are composed\r\nof the same stone. One stone has built the entire city.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised at the idea of the stupendous labor involved in\r\ncarving a city containing half a million of inhabitants, but,\r\nconsidering that a man could easily lift a block of stone weighing\r\nhalf a ton in the outer sphere, I saw that even so prodigious a task\r\nas chiselling Kioram might well be accomplished. It was a new\r\nsensation to bound on a bockhockid over the smoothly carved pavement,\r\nwhere once stood the mighty heart of a mountain of stone. All the\r\nbuildings along the route were wonderfully sculptured. There seemed no\r\nend to the floriated mouldings, pillars and other decorations in\r\nrelief, wrought in a strange order of art that was most captivating.\r\n\r\nAs for ourselves, we must have presented an interesting procession.\r\nOur Viking helmets of polished brass gleamed in the sunlight like\r\ngold. The emblazoned bear thereon was a symbol to the Atvatabarese of\r\na species of divinity that protected us as beings of another world.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at the temple of the sacred locomotive, and were received\r\nby the winged priests in charge. Dismounting amid the sound of music,\r\na procession was formed, the priests leading the way along a wide\r\nhallway that terminated in the temple of the god.\r\n\r\nThe god Rakamadeva was a glorious sight. On a causeway of marble\r\nflanked with steps on either side stood that object of magnic life and\r\nbeauty in a blaze of metals and jewels worthy the praise of the\r\npriests, in itself a royal palace.\r\n\r\nThis automobile car in shape seemed a compound of the back of a turtle\r\nand a Siamese temple, and was of extraordinary magnificence. Both\r\nfront and rear tapered down to the solid platinum framework of the\r\nwheels, that extended beyond the car at both ends, the projections\r\nsimulating the heads of monsters that held each between their jaws one\r\nhundred cells of triple metal, which developed a tremendous force.\r\n\r\nThe priests chanted the following ode to the sacred locomotive:\r\n\r\n\"Glorious annihilator of time and space, lord of distance, imperial\r\ncourier.\r\n\r\n\"Hail, swift and sublime man-created god, hail colossal and bright\r\nwheel!\r\n\r\n\"Thy wheels adamant, thy frame platinum, thy cells terrelium,\r\naquelium!\r\n\r\n\"Thou art lightning shivering on the metals, thy breathless flights\r\naffright Atvatabar!\r\n\r\n\"The affluence of life animates thy form, that flashes through valleys\r\nand on mountains high!\r\n\r\n\"The forests roar as thou goest past, the gorge echoes thy thunder!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SACRED LOCOMOTIVE STORMED THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHTS WITH\r\nITS AUDACIOUS TREAD.]\r\n\r\n\"Thy savage wheels ravage space. Convulsed with life, thy tireless\r\nform devours the heights of heaven!\r\n\r\n\"Labor and glory and terror leap as thy thundering feet go by; thy\r\naxles burn with the steady sweep, till on wings of fire they fly!\"\r\n\r\nThe four-and-twenty priests formed a guard of honor as we\r\nreverentially entered the car. On our side of the god were seated\r\nGovernor Ladalmir, Admiral Jolar and staff, myself and officers of the\r\n_Polar King_, including the scientific staff. The other side contained\r\nthe sailors under command of Flathootly, master-at-arms, escorted by\r\nCaptains Pra and Nototherboc.\r\n\r\nThe priests were distributed around the outside of the car, holding on\r\nto golden hand-rails. A priest seated on a throne in front moved a\r\nswitch, and, with a roar of music, the god leaped upon the metals. The\r\nwonderful lightness of the car allowed us to attain a tremendous\r\nspeed. The mightiest curves were taken at a single breath. The silken\r\nrobes of the priests flashed in the wind.\r\n\r\nThe car vibrated with a thousand tremors. In the wide windows of thick\r\nglass were framed rapid phantasmagoria of landscapes, as the flying\r\npanorama unrolled itself. There were visions of interminable prairies,\r\nover which we swept, a blinding flash, leaving a low, spreading cloud\r\nof dust on the rails to mark our flight.\r\n\r\nWe plunged into tunnels of darkness, where the warm air roared with\r\nthe echoes of the delirious wheels. The cry of the caverns saluted us\r\nlike the shouts of unknown monsters dwelling in the heart of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe sacred locomotive was an element of life, as it shot from the\r\ntunnels and bounded up curving mountain heights through pastures of\r\ndelightful flowers. With wheels prevailed upon by the tension of the\r\ninvincible fluid, the monster swerved not before the proudest\r\nprecipice. It stormed the heights with its audacious tread, flinging\r\nitself on the mountain pass, a marvel of power and intrepidity, and\r\nknown as the devourer of distance.\r\n\r\nIn five hours we had traversed five hundred miles, the distance from\r\nKioram to Calnogor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOUR RECEPTION BY THE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sacred locomotive swept through a noble archway into a palace\r\ngarden, a part of the king's palace in Calnogor. The railway terminal\r\nwas a wide marble platform, or causeway, surrounded by a sea of\r\ntropical flowers. The priests had already alighted, and stood in\r\ndouble file to receive us. Through a sculptured archway a herald\r\napproached us, blowing a trumpet and announcing the coming of his\r\nroyal majesty, King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nWe alighted, and I had the sailors drawn up in an imposing column on\r\nthe platform, every man grasping his sword. Even the remotest walls of\r\nthe garden were lined with wayleals, and military music added to the\r\nsplendor of the scene.\r\n\r\nPresently a stately figure approached us. It was his majesty\r\naccompanied by her majesty, Queen Toplissy. Koshnili whispered that it\r\nwas a special honor that the king and queen should greet us even\r\nbefore we entered the palace. The king was tall and erect in bearing\r\nand his complexion was the color of old gold. His hair, as well as his\r\nclosely-trimmed beard and mustache, were of a serpent-green tint. He\r\nwore a dome-shaped crown of gold, surmounted by a blazing ruby. His\r\ndress was a cloth of gold, light as gossamer, that swathed his form\r\nafter the manner of our Eastern potentates. His boots of\r\ngold-lacquered leather were covered with emeralds and curiously turned\r\nup at the toes. Queen Toplissy was a handsome lady, rather heavy in\r\nphysique, of an orange-yellow complexion, with bright copper-bronze\r\nhair, and her unclad arms wore a profusion of bracelets and armlets of\r\nvarious metals. Her crown was also of gold surmounted by a blazing\r\nsapphire. Her robes were of white silk embroidered with broad bands of\r\norange and arranged in innumerable folds. Her boots were incrusted\r\nwith sapphires. All this I saw at a momentary glance as Koshnili led\r\nme forward to his majesty. I was announced as \"His Excellency,\r\nLexington White, commander of the _Polar King_, the discoverer of the\r\nPolar Gulf, and the first inhabitant of the outer world who had ever\r\nreached Bilbimtesirol and Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\nThe king embraced me and I kissed the hand of her majesty. The\r\nofficers and sailors received their due share of royal attention. We\r\nwere the objects of unbounded curiosity on the part of the royal\r\nretinue.\r\n\r\nAmid a salute of guns and music we passed through the archway that\r\nformed the boundary between the palace gardens and the court of the\r\nholy locomotive, and saw the palace of King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\nIt was a high, conical building, twenty stories in height. Each story\r\nwas surrounded by a row of windows decorated with pillars. Colossal\r\nlions of gold stood on the entrance towers, their claws formed of\r\nstraps of gold running down the walls and riveted to the lower tiers\r\nof stone, giving the impression that they held together the whole\r\nstructure beneath. The style of architecture was an absolutely new\r\norder. It was neither Hindoo, Egyptian, Greek, nor Gothic, but there\r\nwas a flavor of all four styles in the weirdly-carved circular walls\r\nand roofs. The palace was surrounded by a spacious court, enclosed by\r\ncloistered walls. Flowers bloomed in immense square-shaped vases of\r\nstone supported on diminutive square pillars. A tank of crystal water,\r\non each side of which broad wide steps led down into the cool wave,\r\nlay in the centre of the court. The tank was fed by a wide rivulet of\r\nrippling water that ran along a chiselled bed in the marble floor of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nThe entire scene was a picture of glorious and blessed repose. The\r\nsculptor had covered the base and frieze of the walls with a profusion\r\nof ornament in high relief. Imagination and art had produced scenes\r\nthat created a profound impression. A dramatic calmness held lion and\r\nelephant, serpent and eagle, wayleal and bockhockid, youth and maiden,\r\nin glorious embrace.\r\n\r\nThe banquet given by the king in our honor in the topmost story of the\r\npalace was both delicious and satisfying. All the fertility of\r\nAtvatabar ministered to our delight. Strange meats and fruits were\r\nmusic to the body, as art and music were meats and wine to the soul.\r\n\r\nI sat beside his majesty at the feast, while Koshnili sat at my right\r\nhand. Admiral Jolar sat beside the queen, and on her majesty's right\r\nsat Captain Wallace. The professors and other officers, as well as a\r\nnumber of noblemen and state officers, also sat at the royal table.\r\nAt another table sat the sailors, accompanied by the officers of the\r\nking's household.\r\n\r\nWe had again an opportunity of tasting the squang of Atvatabar, which\r\nwas of a finer brand than that served at the table of Governor\r\nLadalmir. It added a new joy to life to taste such royal wine.\r\n\r\nHis majesty, seated on his throne at the feast, raised a glass of\r\nsquang and said: \"I drink in welcome to our illustrious guest, His\r\nExcellency, Lexington White, commander of the _Polar King_ and\r\ndiscoverer of Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\nThe company rising, shouted, \"Welcome to His Excellency, Lexington\r\nWhite, commander of the _Polar King_,\" and drank of their glasses in\r\nmy honor.\r\n\r\nIn acknowledgment of this great compliment I rose and proposed the\r\nhealths of the king and queen. I said: \"I drink to the healths of\r\ntheir royal majesties, King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar and Queen Toplissy of\r\nAtvatabar, to whom be lifelong peace and prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nThe company honored this sentiment by acclamation and drinking goblets\r\nof wine. This constituted the preliminaries of our interview.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said his majesty, \"we are extremely anxious to learn all about\r\nthe manners and customs of the people of the outer world. Tell us of\r\nthese people, their laws, religions, and modes of government.\"\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the king's request I spoke of America and its nations\r\nfounded on the idea of self-sovereignty, and of Europe with its\r\nsovereigns and subjects. I spoke of Egypt and India as types of a\r\ncolossal past, of the United States and Great Britain as types of a\r\ncolossal present, and of Africa the continent of the colossal future.\r\nI informed the king that the genius of Asia, of the Eastern world, ran\r\nto poetry and art without science, while that of the Western world\r\ndeveloped science and invention without poetry and art.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the king, who was intensely interested. \"Atvatabar has\r\nboth science and art, invention and poetry. Our wise rulers have been\r\never mindful of the equal charms of science and sentiment in educating\r\nour people.\"\r\n\r\nI assured his majesty that we were no less anxious to learn all about\r\nthe institutions of Atvatabar than he was regarding the external\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KING EMBRACED ME, AND I KISSED THE HAND OF HER\r\nMAJESTY.]\r\n\r\n\"Atvatabar,\" said the king, \"is a monarchy formed on the will of the\r\npeople. While the throne is inalienably secured to the king for life,\r\nthe government is vested in a legislative chamber, called Borodemy.\r\nThis legislative assembly is also our house of nobles, consisting of\r\none thousand members divided into three classes. To be once elected to\r\nthe Borodemy entitles the representative to receive the title of\r\nBoiroon for life only; at the expiration of five years, the term of\r\neach assembly, a member, if again elected, receives the title of\r\nJangoon; if again elected the highest title is Goiloor. No one can be\r\nelected more than three times, and Goiloor is a title which but few\r\nattain, owing to the limited number of legislators who are three times\r\nelected to the Borodemy. The president of the assembly is always a\r\nGoiloor, as only a member of the highest caste is nominated for the\r\npresidency. He is also chief minister of state. His council, which is\r\nthe government, includes the chief officer of each branch of\r\ngovernment, as well as a royal representative. Thus Atvatabar is an\r\nabsolute democracy, ornamented and ruled by those men whom a generous\r\nnation loves to honor for distinguished merit employed in the public\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE KING UNFOLDS THE GRANDEUR OF ATVATABAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty,\" I said, \"informs us that Atvatabar possesses science\r\nand art, invention and poetry. These matters interest us quite as much\r\nas your civil and military constitution. We will feel grateful if your\r\nmajesty will inform us more particularly regarding the condition of\r\nthose great forces for the development of the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the king; \"the government and the protection of\r\nsociety, although matters of the utmost importance, are always much\r\ninferior to the glory they defend. Mere police duties can never rank\r\nwith the sovereignty of mind over matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" said I, \"the barricade is ever inferior to the\r\npalace, and the treasure house to the heaps of gold within it. But,\r\nyour majesty, in what way does mind triumph over matter in your\r\nrealm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the king, \"we worship the human soul under a thousand\r\nforms, arranged in three great circles of deities. The first circle\r\ncontains the gods of invention, that is, the practical forms by which\r\nideas rule the physical world, and also the composite forms of the\r\ninventors themselves. The second circle contains the gods of art, and\r\nthe third circle the spiritual gods of sorcery, magic and love. What\r\ngods do you people of the outer world worship?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my own country,\" I replied, \"a great many people worship one God,\r\nthe Creator of the universe. Many of these only nominally worship God,\r\nbut in reality worship gold, while a still greater number worship gold\r\nwithout pretence of worshipping anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the king, \"gold is your god. Our god is the aggregated\r\nuniversal human soul worshipped under its various manifestations, both\r\nreal and ideal. This universal human soul forms the one supreme god\r\nHarikar, whom we worship in the person of a living woman, the Supreme\r\nGoddess Lyone. The great generic symbol of our faith is the golden\r\nthrone of the gods in the Bormidophia, whereon sits Lyone, the supreme\r\ngoddess, the representative of Harikar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harikar is then your supreme deity?\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Greatest, for he embraces all other gods,\" said the king. \"But the\r\ngreatest individual god is the Supreme Goddess, the symbol of the Holy\r\nSoul.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a strange desire to learn everything about so singular a\r\ndivinity as Lyone. It was a weird, awful, yet terribly entrancing\r\nthought, that amid a thousand gods of dead and silent gold one only\r\nshould be alive, and that one a beautiful woman. Was it possible that\r\na live goddess could exist, and be both young and handsome? I was\r\nanxious to ask a thousand questions concerning this mysterious being,\r\nbut it seemed a sacrilege to ask them. Was it possible for her to\r\ncontinue worthy of worship, a human being, intoxicated, as she must\r\nbe, by the ceaseless adoration of millions? In other words, can a\r\nwoman be a veritable goddess and live? These ideas rushed through my\r\nsoul like quicksilver. My brain reeled with this discovery of the\r\nsecret of Atvatabar! What to me were its never-setting sun, its want\r\nof gravity, its flying wayleals and bockhockids, its sculptured\r\ncities, its sacred locomotive, its miracles of mechanism and art,\r\ncompared to a real live goddess with warm blood and a beating heart!\r\nNo wonder the discovery thrilled me! I felt like embracing his majesty\r\nfor the information, so simply given, that filled me with delight!\r\n\r\nMy companions were also greatly excited at the story of the king, and\r\nit was with difficulty I could appear interested in the further\r\ninformation he so graciously imparted to us. What were mines of gold\r\nto this? But I strove outwardly to appear calm. I felt I must listen\r\nfurther to the story of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\n\"Our other deities,\" continued the king, \"are the ideal inventors and\r\ntheir inventions. These give man empire over nature. All those who\r\nhave given man power of flight, who multiply his power to run, those\r\nwho multiply the power of the eye to see, the hand to labor or to\r\nsmite, the voice or pen to transmit ideas to great distances and to\r\ngreat multitudes, stand in the pantheon in ideal grandeur. There are\r\nthe lords of labor, the deities of space and time. They are those gods\r\nthat breathe the breath of life into unborn ideas, and lo! from brain\r\nand hand spring the creatures of their will.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers and sailors were listening to the discourse of the king\r\nwith rapt attention. We were anxious to learn as much as possible\r\nabout this strange religion of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\n\"We also worship art and ideal artists,\" continued the king, \"the\r\nsoul-developers, who work for noble and humane ideas expressed in\r\ntheir most beautiful garb; the builders of earthly palaces for the\r\nsoul in literature, music, manners, painting, dancing, sculpture,\r\ndecoration, tapestry and architecture which are represented by ideal\r\nstatues composed from groups of living artists. These in their ideal\r\nor collective perfection are the gods who counteract the evils of an\r\narid and mechanical civilization by arousing feeling, imagination,\r\ntruth, beauty, tenderness, patriotism and faith in the souls of their\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n\"The spiritual forces are typified by a goddess, the incarnation of\r\nspirit power, of romantic, ideal, hopeless love. Her ministers are the\r\npriests of sorcery, necromancy, magic, theosophy, mesmerism,\r\nspiritualism and other kindred spiritual powers. These perform\r\nmiracles, create matter, and impart life to dead bodies. The souls of\r\nher priests and priestesses have the power to leave the body at will,\r\nand to achieve a present Nirvana of one hundred years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nGNAPHISTHASIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day following our arrival in Calnogor his majesty the king had\r\nprojected for us a journey to the palace of art at Gnaphisthasia,\r\nwhich stood on the slope of a mountain in a rich valley lying one\r\nhundred miles southwest of Calnogor. The palace itself was surrounded\r\nby high walls of massive porcelain, beautifully adorned with sculpture\r\nmouldings, and midway on each side massive gateways, each formed of\r\nrounded cones, rising to a great height and covered with sculptured\r\nforms, between which the porcelain wall was pierced with fretted\r\narabesque, running high above the arched opening beneath. Once within\r\nthe gorgeous gateway, the porcelain walls of Gnaphisthasia stood\r\nbefore the enraptured eyes more than a mile in length and half a mile\r\nin depth, a many-colored dream of imposing magnificence covered with\r\nthe work of sculptors. The principal part of the wall was of a\r\ngreenish-white vitrification, finely diversified by horizontal\r\nfriezes, with arabesques in red and green, purple and yellow,\r\nlavender, sea-green, blue and silver and pale rose and deep gray, all\r\nseparated by wide bands of greenish-white stone.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the buildings stood a semi-circle of massive conical\r\ntowers, gleaming like enormous jewels and connected by sculptured\r\nwalls. The four corners of the palace were also groups of towers, all\r\nthe various groups being connected with the rectangular walls that\r\nwere decorated with arcades and balconies.\r\n\r\nHere in this splendid abode were poets and painters, musicians,\r\nsculptors and architects, dancers, weavers of fabrics, ceramists,\r\njewellers, engravers, enamellers, artists in lacquer, carvers,\r\ndesigners and workers in glass and metal, pearl and ivory and the\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PROCESSION OF PRIESTS AND PRIESTESSES PASSED DOWN THE\r\nLIVING AISLES, BEARING TROPHIES OF ART.]\r\n\r\nIn an immense chamber of the palace a _fete_ was being held. On either\r\nside a double range of massive porcelain pillars supported the roof,\r\nwhich covered this grand sanctuary of art like an immense vitrified\r\njewel. The floor of the court was formed of polished wood of a deep\r\nrose color that emitted a rich, heavy perfume. Wood of a brilliant\r\ngreen, with interlacing arabesques of red, formed the border of the\r\nfloor. At the further end of the court stood three thrones, being\r\ncomposed, respectively, of terrelium, aquelium, and plutulium, the\r\nthree most precious metals. On the threefold throne sat Yermoul, lord\r\nof art, his majesty the king, and myself. In ample recesses amid the\r\npillars stood the devotees of art, while the centre of the court was\r\nfilled with the musicians. A procession of priests and priestesses\r\npassed down the living aisles, clad in the most gorgeous fabrics of\r\nsilk spun by gigantic spiders, and they bore singly trophies of art,\r\nor moved in groups, supporting golden litters carrying piled-up\r\ntreasures of dazzling splendor.\r\n\r\nFirst came a band of priestesses bearing fan-like ensigns of carved\r\nwood and fretwork, and panels filled with silks, rare brocades and\r\nembroideries. Then came priests bearing heavy vases and urns of gold,\r\nterrelium, aquelium, plutulium, silver, and alloys of precious bronze.\r\nThen followed others bearing litters piled with vases and figures\r\ncarved from solid pearl, or fashioned in precious metals. Cups,\r\nplates, vases in endless shapes, designs and colors went past, piled\r\nhigh on golden litters, looking like gardens of tropic flowers. Rare\r\nlaces made of threads spun from the precious metals of Atvatabar,\r\nmosaics, ivories, art forgings, costly enamels, decorative\r\nbas-reliefs, implements of war, agriculture and commerce, magnic\r\nspears and daggers, with shaft and handle encrusted with grotesque\r\ncarvings in metallic alloys. These alloys took the forms of figures,\r\nanimals and emblems, having the strangest colorings, like the hilts\r\nand scabbards of Japanese swords carved in shakudo and shibuichi.\r\nThere were exhibited vases of cinnabar, vases wondrously carved from\r\ntea-rose, coral-red, pearl-gray, ashes-of-roses, mustard-yellow,\r\napple-green, pistache and crushed-strawberry colored metals. There\r\nwere also splendid crowns, flowers, animals, birds, and fishes, carved\r\nfrom precious kragon, an imperial stone harder than the diamond and of\r\na pale rose-pink color. Every object was as perfect as though modelled\r\nin wax.\r\n\r\nThrough all this decorative movement there was something more than\r\ndecoration understood as mere ornamentation--there was the keenest\r\nevidence of soul movement on the part of the artist. The music\r\ngloriously celebrated the passions of love, ambition and triumph that\r\nhad filled the souls of the artists when engaged in their incomparable\r\nlabors, and pealed forth that serene life of the spirit as symbolized\r\nin the perfect works of art exhibited, wherein were sealed in eternal\r\nmagnificence fragments of the souls that had created them.\r\n\r\nBetween the pauses of the music an organ-megaphone shouted forth in\r\nmusically-stentorian tones the words that had been impressed on its\r\ncylinders in praise of art. The five thousand priests and priestesses\r\nof art had simultaneously shouted their art ritual down five thousand\r\ntubes, which were all focussed into a single tube of large calibre.\r\nThe multitudinous sound of their voices had been indelibly impressed\r\non this phonograph-megaphone that now yielded up the sentiments\r\nimpressed upon it, its tones being that of a vast multitude,\r\nre-enforced by the vibrating music of an organ, which was a part of\r\nthe megaphone. These were the passages repeated by the instrument with\r\na startling splendor of sound:\r\n\r\n     THE MESSAGE OF THE MEGAPHONE.\r\n\r\n                    I.\r\n\r\n     To define art is to define life.\r\n\r\n                   II.\r\n\r\n     Art is a language that describes the souls of things.\r\n\r\n                  III.\r\n\r\n     Art in nature is the expression of life; in art it is life\r\n     itself.\r\n\r\n                   IV.\r\n\r\n     Art is too subtle a quality to be defined by the formula of\r\n     the critic. It is greater than all of the definitions that\r\n     have tried to grasp it.\r\n\r\n                    V.\r\n\r\n     Art is the glowing focus from which radiate thought,\r\n     imagination and feeling, gifted with the power of utterance.\r\n\r\n                   VI.\r\n\r\n     True art is generous, passionate, earnest, vivid,\r\n     enthusiastic. So also is the true artist.\r\n\r\n                  VII.\r\n\r\n     To satisfy the far-reaching longing of the spirit, art makes\r\n     things more glorious than they are. It is the perfect\r\n     expression of a perfect environment.\r\n\r\n                 VIII.\r\n\r\n     To mould his symbols with the same life that fills his\r\n     conception of the idea is the supreme effort of the artist.\r\n\r\n                   IX.\r\n\r\n     As nature from the coarse soil produces flowers, so also the\r\n     artist from every-day life produces the subtle sweets of\r\n     art.\r\n\r\n                    X.\r\n\r\n     Art that is simply utility is not sufficiently decorative to\r\n     delight every nerve of feeling in the soul. To feed these,\r\n     many flavors of form and color are necessary, and hence the\r\n     necessity of art.\r\n\r\n                   XI.\r\n\r\n     Where do emotion and imagination begin in art? Where do\r\n     spirit and flesh unite in a living creature?\r\n\r\n                  XII.\r\n\r\n     The artist is a creator. He breathes into dull matter the\r\n     breath of art, and it thenceforth contains a living soul.\r\n\r\n                 XIII.\r\n\r\n     Poetry and art make life splendid without science, which is\r\n     the cold investigation of that which was once thrilled with\r\n     the passion of life. Invention makes life splendid without\r\n     poetry and art. By whom will the glorious union of art and\r\n     science be consummated?\r\n\r\n                  XIV.\r\n\r\n     What is the world we live in? It is for the most part a\r\n     collection of souls hidebound with treachery and\r\n     selfishness; of souls covered with a slag from which have\r\n     departed the fires of love and passion and delight. Such\r\n     incinerated _aliases_ of their former selves are your\r\n     judges, oh, artists!\r\n\r\n                   XV.\r\n\r\n     Art is a green oasis in an arid and mechanical civilization.\r\n     It creates an earthly home for the soul, for those wounded\r\n     by the riot of trade, the weariness of labor, the fierce\r\n     struggle for gold, and the deadly environment of rushing\r\n     travel, blasted pavements and the withering disappointments\r\n     of life.\r\n\r\n                  XVI.\r\n\r\n     Where is that artist that can sway imagination, create\r\n     emotion, lift the banner of a high ideal, give the soul a\r\n     keener appreciation of beauty, add to the mind, strength and\r\n     grace, cause the brain to develop new nerves of feeling and\r\n     newer cells of thought, that we may salute him as genius?\r\n\r\n                 XVII.\r\n\r\n     Art is the emotion within made splendid by imagination that\r\n     clothes everything with perfection. Like color it dwells\r\n     only in the soul, but the cause of the sensation is without.\r\n     In all art, the artist seeks to reproduce the cause of his\r\n     ecstasy, that he may communicate to others a similar\r\n     delight. He is like a god, he always gives but never\r\n     receives, for fame, not money, is his recompense.\r\n\r\n                XVIII.\r\n\r\n     Given a soul that can feel sublimely, that can respond to\r\n     beauty and feel thrilled with the joy of existence, that can\r\n     feel the burden of anguish, that can appreciate the humors\r\n     and absurdities of life, and given the power to adequately\r\n     represent the knowledge, truth, understanding and conviction\r\n     of these impressions in fitting symbols, vitalized by\r\n     imagination and emotion, then have we both poet and artist.\r\n\r\n                  XIX.\r\n\r\n     The soul in such inspired moments takes the form of\r\n     sculptured arabesques, or flowers, or resembles the refluent\r\n     sea, full of incredible shapes and symbols. It accompanies\r\n     the march of thought, the profusive swell of emotion, is\r\n     capable of pain and ecstasy, and seeks to be fed with those\r\n     delightful symbols of its life which we call art, the most\r\n     priceless of earthly possessions.\r\n\r\n                   XX.\r\n\r\n     Four things are necessary for art, viz.: idea, sentiment,\r\n     imagination and manipulative skill. After these comes\r\n     prestige, or the applause of the world, to crown the work.\r\n\r\n                  XXI.\r\n\r\n     The art decorator is a type of all art workmen. See him\r\n     about to manipulate a plastic ornament on the wall. The\r\n     plaster resembles his idea; its plastic qualities his\r\n     sentiment, or emotion; the style of ornament into which it\r\n     is to be moulded resembles his imagination, and the power of\r\n     the artist to successfully and triumphantly embody in the\r\n     finished ornament the living, breathing idea that fills him\r\n     is his manipulative skill. Any work of art, if perfect in\r\n     itself, still remains unfinished until the world comes along\r\n     and applauds.\r\n\r\n                 XXII.\r\n\r\n     The age wants the artist. It wants imagination, originality,\r\n     inspiration, ideality. It requires fertile, dreaming souls,\r\n     to create ideal breadth.\r\n\r\n     It requires an earthly Nirvana wherein one may escape a\r\n     selfish, barbarous, pitiless world. There is a great dearth\r\n     of the coinage of the soul. We want artists to explain the\r\n     souls of things, not their mechanical construction, but the\r\n     unseen secret of their purposes, their unspeakable\r\n     existence. We want heart-expanding triumphs to counteract\r\n     the withering influences of life. If a soul is entranced\r\n     with man or nature, we also want to feel his fascination, to\r\n     be penetrated with his rapture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe megaphone ceased its musical vociferation, which formed a\r\nspiritual exercise for the souls assembled before us. I felt entranced\r\nand lifted up to a plane of splendid life hitherto unknown in my\r\nexperience. I began to understand that art, after all, is the one\r\nthing in our terrestrial life worth striving for, in fact our only\r\npossession. For is it not the transmission of the soul to outer\r\nmatter, whose savagery may be thus charmed and subdued to become a\r\nsatisfactory spiritual environment?\r\n\r\nFollowing the procession of artists came beautiful, wondrously-arrayed\r\ndancers, whose evolutions made the brain dizzy with delight. Fair\r\npriests and priestesses of art formed upon the floor of the palace\r\ndecorative arabesques of scrolls and interlacements of living bodies,\r\nthe color of their garments mingling in perfectly harmonious hues,\r\nbeautiful beyond comparison. Their ceaseless evolutions were made to\r\nthe measure of perfect music. Panels and bands of living decorations\r\nwere framed and transformed like the magical changes of the\r\nkaleidoscope. At last Yermoul, the Lord of Art, waved his wand, and\r\nthe dancers stood transfixed, a garden of ecstatic color like a\r\nPersian carpet, wonderfully designed and vividly emblazoned. It was a\r\nscene of royal magnificence. These priests and priestesses were the\r\nart workers of Gnaphisthasia, who had so finely exhibited their\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nFollowing the rhythmic movements of the art workers came poets,\r\npainters, sculptors, whose works lifted the soul to higher planes of\r\nbeing. These in their trophies of art recited or exhibited gave the\r\nsoul imagination and sentiment, lifting it almost to the enraptured\r\nheight of worship, adoration and love.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the ceremonies we were entertained by Yermoul, Lord of\r\nArt, at a banquet, at which music and song and the dancing of\r\nvoluptuous priestesses made hearts thrill with delight. Bidding\r\nfarewell at last to the Lord of Art and his priests and priestesses,\r\nhis majesty, myself and our company returned by the sacred locomotive\r\nto Calnogor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY TO THE BORMIDOPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palace bell announced the beginning of a new day in Calnogor. I\r\nhad not slept during the hours of rest, excited as I was by our visit\r\nto Gnaphisthasia and the strange customs of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nKoshnili arrived soon after the bell had sounded to inform me that the\r\nking had commanded his royal army to be assembled in the great square\r\nbeyond the palace walls to escort us to the Bormidophia, where a\r\nsolemn act of worship would be performed before the throne of the\r\ngods. This was a most delightful message, as nothing on earth could\r\nplease me better than to witness the glories of the Bormidophia.\r\n\r\nThe army under the command of Prince Coltonobory, the brother of the\r\nking, commander-in-chief, consisted of 250,000 wayleals, or flying\r\nsoldiers, and 50,000 bockhockids, or flying cavalry. There was also a\r\ndetachment of 10,000 fletyemings, or sailors of the royal navy. These\r\nwere drawn up in review in a vast square before the royal palace.\r\n\r\nSuperb bockhockids conveyed us the four miles to the Bormidophia in\r\nthe centre of the city.\r\n\r\nThe king and queen, both of whom wore crowns blazing with jewels, sat\r\nwith Koshnili and myself in the first palanquin of bockhockids. The\r\nhigh officers of the government and nobles of the Borodemy, together\r\nwith the officers and sailors of the _Polar King_, were distributed\r\namong the other stately litters.\r\n\r\nThe route to the pantheon was lined with palaces. An immense\r\npopulation thronged either side of the roadway. A review of the army\r\ntook place _en route_. The wayleals first rose into an enormous\r\nflying column, which subsided into whirling domes and afterward broke\r\nup into a dozen living globes, that appeared to roll one after another\r\non the ground. These were dissolved into a solid army marching on foot\r\nfor a time. Then as if by magic the entire mass of men rose into\r\nspiral columns which dissolved into vast rings inextricably involved\r\nwith each other. It was a sight unique and bewildering.\r\n\r\nBehind the wayleals, fifty thousand bockhockids kept up their steady\r\nmarch. The people shouted with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nA mimic battle took place in the air above us. Ten thousand wayleals\r\nfought on either side, brilliant in many-colored uniforms. Finally, a\r\nrainbow arch of flying men spanned the entrance to the great square of\r\nthe Bormidophia, or pantheon. Amid the thunder of guns and music, the\r\nentire company alighted at the doors of the pantheon, which consisted\r\nof an immense circular pile of buildings over a mile in circumference.\r\nThe interior revealed a scene of surpassing magnificence. Endless\r\ntiers of seats were arranged in terraces that, rising above each\r\nother, traversed the wide sweep of the amphitheatre. The entire\r\npantheon with its adjacent palaces and colonnades was sculptured out\r\nof a hill of green marble. The exterior walls, rising 200 feet, were\r\ncrowned with a lofty dome of enamelled glass, through which the light\r\nof the sun streamed in myriad colors on the sea of worshippers\r\nbeneath. The walls of the pantheon, both exteriorly and interiorly,\r\nwere sculptured with immense reliefs, the trophies of invention and\r\nart, as well as the magical symbols of spiritual forces.\r\n\r\nThe lowest circle of the amphitheatre reached down one hundred feet\r\nbelow the level of the outer pavement, and the royal seat was on a\r\nlevel with the ground and fifty feet below the top of the far-famed\r\ngolden throne of the gods, that stood in the centre of the immense\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nOur entrance was the signal for welcoming music and a suppressed\r\nmurmur of excitement from the myriads of worshippers that sat both\r\nabove and below us. The amphitheatre contained not less than 50,000\r\npeople. The moment their majesties were seated, a roar of artillery\r\nshook the earth. The forthcoming grand act of worship was evidently\r\ninstituted in our honor, for we were the observed of all eyes in that\r\nvast concourse of people.\r\n\r\nA dozen choirs, possessed of all kinds of beautiful instruments,\r\ncaressed the ear with their melodious songs. There was no dim\r\nreligious light; everything was open-eyed beneath that splendid dome.\r\nSuddenly a cloud of flying priests and priestesses seated themselves\r\non a pyramid formed of terraces of solid silver fifty feet in height\r\nthat supported the miraculous throne. They at once began to sing with\r\nsuch force and pathos as to dissolve the multitude into a hush of\r\nbreathless silence.\r\n\r\nThen an immense bell of bronze filled the pantheon with a sonorous\r\nmoan. Twelve thrilling tones made souls tremble and heads bow down.\r\nWith the last vibration there rose from the crown of the throne of the\r\ngods a living woman, nude to the waist, having a broad belt of gold\r\nstudded with gems clasping her figure, from which fell to her feet a\r\ngarment of aquelium lace wrought with magical symbols.\r\n\r\nShe was a girl of peerless development; her arms were long and softly\r\nmoulded, her breasts firm and splendid. The color of her complexion\r\nand flesh was of soft mat gold, like that of golden fruit, and a\r\nperceptible flush warmed her cheeks. Her profile was perfect, being\r\nboth proud and tender in outline. Her hair was a heavy glossy mass, of\r\na pale sapphire-blue color, that fell in a waving cloud around her\r\nshoulders. Her whole figure bore an infinitely gracious expression,\r\nthe result of possessing a tender and sympathetic soul.\r\n\r\nOn her head was a tiara of terrelium, the vermilion metal, studded\r\nwith gems, on her neck she wore a necklace of emerald-green sapphires,\r\nwhile on either wrist were broad gold bracelets, having a magnificent\r\nblue sapphire on each.\r\n\r\nShe was Lyone, the Supreme Goddess of Atvatabar, the representative of\r\nHarikar, the Holy Soul; Queen of Magicians; Mother of Sorcerers, and\r\nPrincess of Arjeels.\r\n\r\nStanding erect for a moment, as if to assure the vast congregation of\r\nher presence, she then slowly sat down on a broad divan of aloe-green\r\nsilk velvet, holding in her right hand the terrelium sceptre of\r\nspiritual sovereignty, whose head bore two hearts formed of flaming\r\nrubies.\r\n\r\nI was entranced with the appearance of the divine girl, the object of\r\nthe adoration of Atvatabar. Every feature of her face was carved with\r\na full and ripe roundness, exhibiting repose and power. Her eyes,\r\nlarge and blue and lustrous, were sorcery itself. There was in them an\r\nunutterable tenderness, a divine hospitality, the result of vast pride\r\nand still vaster sympathy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE THRONE SAT THE SUPREME GODDESS, LYONE, THE\r\nREPRESENTATIVE OF HARIKAR, THE HOLY SOUL.]\r\n\r\nAll at once she gazed at me! I felt filled with a fever of delicious\r\ndelight, of intoxicating adoration. I could then understand the\r\ndevotion of Atvatabar, of hearts slain by eyes that were conquering\r\nswords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE THRONE OF THE GODS, CALNOGOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe throne of the gods was the most famous institution in Atvatabar.\r\nIt was the cynosure of every eye, the object of all adoration, the\r\ntabernacle of all that was splendid in art, science and spiritual\r\nperfection. The great institutions of Egyplosis, the college of ten\r\nthousand soul-worshippers, the palace of Gnaphisthasia, with its five\r\nthousand poets, artists, musicians, dancers, architects, and weavers\r\nof glorious cloths, and the establishments for training the youth of\r\nthe country in mechanical skill, were but the outlying powers that\r\nlent glory to the throne itself. It was the standard of virtue, of\r\nsoul, of genius, skill and art. It was the triune symbol of body, mind\r\nand spirit. It was the undying voice of Atvatabar proclaiming the\r\ngrandeur of soul development; that pleasure, rightly guarded, may be\r\nvirtue. The religion of Harikar in a word was this, that the Nirvana,\r\nor blessedness promised the followers of the supernatural creeds of\r\nthe outer world, after death was to be enjoyed in the body in earthly\r\nlife without the trouble of dying to gain it. This was a comfortable\r\nstate of things, if only possible of accomplishment, and such a creed\r\nof necessity included the doctrine that the physical death of the body\r\nwas the end of all individuality, the soul thereafter losing all\r\npersonality in the great ocean of existence.\r\n\r\nThe throne of the gods was a cone of solid gold one hundred feet in\r\nheight, divided into three parts for the various castes of gods, or\r\nsymbols of science, art and spirituality. The structure was a circular\r\nsolid cone of gold, shaped somewhat in the form of a heart. It was\r\nindeed the golden heart of Atvatabar, proclaiming that sentiment and\r\nscience should go hand in hand; that in all affairs of life the heart\r\nshould be an important factor. The lower section, or scientific\r\npantheon, possessed bas-reliefs of models or symbols of the more\r\nimportant inventions. This section was forty feet in height and\r\nseventy-two feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe images of the gods themselves surmounting the lowest part of the\r\nthrone were in reality composite man-gods, that is to say, each figure\r\nwas a statue, life size, of the resultant of the statues of all the\r\nimportant developers of each invention and was thus obtained:\r\n\r\nAs soon as any prominent inventor or developer of an invention died,\r\nthe government secured a plaster cast of his body, if such had not\r\nbeen made prior to death, and this was preserved for years in a\r\nspecial museum. When twenty or more casts of various developers of any\r\none invention had been accumulated these were placed on a horizontal\r\nwheel, which revolved in front of a photographic camera, and thus the\r\ncomposite outline of the future god was obtained. As many outlines\r\nwere procured as there were eighths of inches in the circumference of\r\nthe largest cast, and from the collective pictures the ideal cast was\r\nmade by the sculptor. The cast once perfected, and afterward draped,\r\nwas reproduced in solid gold and placed with appropriate ceremonies on\r\na pedestal on the throne itself. In like manner the gods of the arts,\r\npoetry, painting, etc., were created, as also the priests of Harikar,\r\nthe Holy Soul.\r\n\r\nThe reliefs, or symbols of mechanical art, were originally cast on the\r\nthrone itself. These included the electric engine and locomotive,\r\nelectric healer, telephone, telegraph, the electric ship, elevator,\r\nprinting press, cotton gin, weaving loom, typesetting machine,\r\nwell-boring apparatus, telescope, flying machines (individual and\r\ncollective), bockhockid, sewing machine, photographic camera, reaping\r\nmachine, paper-making and wall-paper printing machine, phonograph,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis department of the throne being the largest, was significant of\r\nthe material supremacy of the mechanical arts in the nation. Science\r\nitself was a god named Triporus, fashioned like a winged snake, so\r\ncalled because it was said he could worm his way through the pores of\r\nmatter so as to discover the secrets therein. This god seemed a\r\ncompound of our ancient Sphinx, or science, and Daedalus, or mechanical\r\nskill, but with an entirely new meaning added to both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THRONE OF THE GODS WAS INDEED THE GOLDEN HEART OF\r\nATVATABAR, THE TRIUNE SYMBOL OF BODY, MIND AND SPIRIT.]\r\n\r\nThe second or intermediate section of the throne was devoted to the\r\ngods of art and their attributes. It was sixty feet in its largest\r\ndiameter, and twenty-four feet in height. It possessed also two\r\nsections, the upper containing the statues of Aidblis, or Poetry;\r\nDimborne, or Painting; Brecdil, or Sculpture; Swenge, or Music;\r\nTilono, or Drama; Timpango, or Dancing; Olshodesdil, or Architecture,\r\netc., etc. In the lower section there were tableaux cast in high\r\nrelief illustrating the qualities of the soul developed by art, viz.:\r\nOmodrilon, or Imagination; Diandarn, or Emotion; Samadoan, or\r\nConscience; Voedli, or Faith; Lentilmid, or Tenderness; Delidoa, or\r\nTruth, etc.\r\n\r\nThe final section or tapering apex of the throne was thirty feet in\r\ngreatest width and thirty-six feet in height. It contained a throne\r\nand three divisions. The lowest division contained the gods Hielano,\r\nor Magic; Bishano, or Sorcery; Nidialano, or Astrology; Padomano, or\r\nSoothsaying, etc.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate division contained the gods Niano, or Witchcraft;\r\nRedohano, or Wizardry; Oxemano, or Diablerie; Biccano, or the Oracle;\r\nAmano, or Seership; Kielano, or Augury; Tocderano, or Prophecy;\r\nJiracano, or Geomancy; Jocdilano, or Necromancy, etc.\r\n\r\nThe third division contained the gods Orphitano, or Conjuration;\r\nOrielano, or Divination; Pridano, or Clairvoyance; Cideshano, or\r\nElectro-biology; Omdohlopano, or Theosophy; Bischanamano, or\r\nSpiritualism, etc.\r\n\r\nThe climax of all was the throne of the goddess. It was a seat of\r\naloe-green velvet that, revolving slowly in the centre of the\r\nsupporting throne, presented the goddess to every section of the vast\r\naudience. Thus seated, the goddess radiated an Orient splendor,\r\nherself a blaze of beauty and the focus of every eye. The music of an\r\nintroductory opera warbled its soft strains with breathless execution.\r\nIt seemed the carolling of a thousand nightingales, mingling with the\r\nmusical crying of silver trumpets and the clear electric chiming of\r\ngolden bells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE WORSHIP OF LYONE, SUPREME GODDESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worship of the goddess began with the appearance on a revolving\r\nstage between the nearest worshippers and the base of the throne\r\nitself of a veritable forest of trees about one hundred feet in width.\r\nThere were trees like magnolias, oaks, elms and others splendid in\r\nfoliage, and amid these there was an undergrowth of beds of the most\r\nbrilliant flowers.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of the magicians and sorcerers!\r\n\r\nThere were thickets of camellias and rhododendrons, amid which bloomed\r\nflowers like scarlet geraniums, primroses, violets and poppies. What\r\nappeared to be apple, peach, cherry and hawthorn trees, all in full\r\nbloom, tossed their white and pink foam of flowers.\r\n\r\nThey were real trees and flowers, made to exist for a time by the\r\nsorcery of the masters of spirit power. They had never before known\r\nthe outer air. The priests of Harikar had made them, and would\r\ndissipate them as living bodies are dissipated by death.\r\n\r\nA sacred opera was chanted by the priests of invention, art, and\r\nspirituality, on their terraces of silver above the trees and flowers.\r\nAs the music continued, groups of singers would at times sweep forth\r\non wings and float in wheeling circles around the throne. Their\r\ndelightful choruses swelling upward were like draughts of rich wine,\r\nkeen and intoxicating. The priests and spiritual powers marching\r\nbeneath filled the vast building with broad recitatives, full of\r\nvividly descriptive passages and finely contrasted measures, until the\r\nsoul seemed melted in a sea of bliss.\r\n\r\nThe throne was bathed and caressed by a blue vapor of incense, while\r\nfrom the great dome above, filled with figures formed of enamelled\r\nglass, there streamed lights of all mysterious colors, that\r\nilluminated its gleaming sides and lit up the amphitheatre with\r\nineffable effects.\r\n\r\nA warm, rosy beam, falling perpendicularly, enveloped the goddess like\r\na robe of transparent tissue. She sat, a living statue, the joy of\r\nevery heart, the embodiment of a hopeless love that kept the\r\nworshipper in a fever of delicious unrest. Wherever the eye wandered,\r\nit always came back to the goddess; whatever the soul thought, its\r\nlast thought was of her.\r\n\r\nAmid a tempest of music and the thundering song of two hundred\r\nthousand voices repeating a litany of love, the throne itself began to\r\nrevolve upon the silver cone that supported it. A fresh rapture took\r\npossession of the multitude.\r\n\r\nIn the soul of the goddess what must have been the joy of being\r\nsurrounded by such an ocean of adoring love?\r\n\r\nAs I mused on the scene, I thought of the Coliseum at Rome raised to\r\nthe glory of barbaric force, of empire founded on the blood of its\r\nvictims, and, being such, has necessarily passed away, becoming a heap\r\nof ruins.\r\n\r\nHere, thought I, is a temple founded on a nobler idea, the glory of\r\nthe human soul, its ingenuity, art, and spiritual forces.\r\n\r\nMany in the outer world would say it was an idolatrous attempt on the\r\npart of the creature to usurp the throne of its Creator. Yet it was\r\nstrangely like the religion of such people themselves. There, as here,\r\nI thought, is the same worship of gold, the same dependence on the\r\nmaterial products of man's invention, the same worship of art, the\r\nsame idolatry of each other's souls between the sexes. There is this\r\ndifference, however: in the outer world men pretend that they worship\r\nsomething else other than such objects; here they have the honesty to\r\nsay what they do actually worship.\r\n\r\nApart from the idea of attempting to realize a friendship that can\r\nonly exist in a realm that knows neither interest, fortune, time,\r\nambition, temper, nor sensual love, their idolatry had one splendid\r\ntruth to unfold, viz., the necessity of a soul for an arid and\r\nmechanical civilization. \"Every intellect shall enfold a soul\" was\r\ntheir motto, and there was this sanity in their creed that sentiment\r\nwas the breath of its life. Science abhors sentiment; it is the cold\r\ninvestigation of that which once thrilled with the passion of life.\r\n\r\nWhile the singing continued, a band of neophytes of occult force\r\nperformed marvellous feats of magic, led by the Grand Sorcerer,\r\nCharka, chief of the magicians of Harikar. The people sat enraptured\r\nas miracle after miracle was performed. At the waving of fans by the\r\nadepts, plants issued from the hands of every god of gold, clothing\r\nthe throne in one endless wreath of brilliant crimson blossoms and\r\ngreen foliage. The fans again waved and that crimson mass of flowers\r\nturned to a pale green, while again the green foliage changed to a\r\nvermilion color. The throne appeared like one enormous Bougainvillea\r\nglabra, whose leaves are flowers.\r\n\r\nAgain the fans were waved and the flowers changed to bloom all\r\nsnowy-white, while the foliage became blue.\r\n\r\nThe adepts disappeared at a given signal and thereupon entered another\r\nband of beautiful girl adepts, who seated themselves, each body in a\r\ncrouched mass with flowing drapery, around the base of the throne.\r\nThese priestesses were in a state of catalepsy. The ego, or soul, in\r\neach case had been separated from the body, which floated in a state\r\nof apparent death. They had so developed their will by thinking\r\nenormous thoughts, yearning for spiritual power, that they could\r\nsuspend the functions of the body and give all their existence to the\r\nsoul. Thus hypnotized, it was stated their souls were floating freely\r\nin the dome above, in blessed converse, and that their reincarnation\r\nwould afterward take place.\r\n\r\nThe organ rolled a blessed monotone, with variations exquisitely\r\nsweet. The light in the dome faded perceptibly by the magical\r\nshadowing of its windows until the rapt audience sat in complete\r\ndarkness. A circle of electric lights burned around the goddess on the\r\ntop of the throne, illuminating her figure. The lights faintly lit up\r\nthe dome, and presently appeared as nude spectres the fifty souls of\r\nthe priestesses who crouched beneath.\r\n\r\nThe organ, re-enforced with the wailing of a hundred violins, produced\r\na storm of the most delirious music, while the souls flashed with a\r\nstrange phosphorescence like a circle of fire. They wheeled with their\r\narms extended horizontally, each aura lying at an angle of forty-five\r\ndegrees with the horizon. Then, with hands clasping each other's feet,\r\nthey became a vertical circle like the wheel of fortune, and thus went\r\nround and round. Again, they revolved in a circle faces downward, with\r\narms and hands stretched in an attitude of worship, forming for the\r\ngoddess a wreath of souls. Presently each soul sought its own body\r\nfloating beneath. The bodies expanding themselves absorbed each its\r\nown soul. With the returning light of the outer sun the forest beneath\r\nthe throne had disappeared and the circular stage was occupied by a\r\nband of sorcerers--each having balls of jelly of various colors\r\nfloating before him. At the command of the grand sorcerer the balls\r\nwould transform themselves into strange animals resembling cats, dogs,\r\nmonkeys, serpents, geese, wolves, and eagles. This was a tableau\r\nrepresenting man's supremacy over inferior life.\r\n\r\nA company of twin souls of the greatest beauty and splendor of raiment\r\ntook possession of the circular platform beneath the throne and\r\nthereupon danced in rhythmic circles wonderfully entrancing and\r\ninvolved, chanting, in harmony with the movement of their bodies, the\r\nfollowing hymn to Lyone:\r\n\r\n                 TO LYONE.\r\n\r\n                    I.\r\n\r\n    Oh goddess, oh deity glorious,\r\n        With golden wan face, and the bloom\r\n    Of spirit and figure victorious!\r\n        Oh jewel that lighteneth gloom,\r\n    Men call thee the soul of a lover,\r\n        Invested with purest of clay,\r\n    A chrysalis, eager to hover\r\n        And fly from thy prison away!\r\n\r\n                    II.\r\n\r\n    A nautilus, blown on the tide-lave;\r\n        So naked a pearl and so pure,\r\n    Or coral, that sucks from the sea wave\r\n        Those marbles that ever endure!\r\n    Thus float on the ocean of being,\r\n        Or fathom its deep-flowing sea,\r\n    That feeling, believing, and seeing\r\n        Thy glory, will worshipped be!\r\n\r\n                    III.\r\n\r\n    With sense of the body made captive,\r\n        While that of the soul is complete.\r\n    For love of pure being, receptive,\r\n        So blessed, extravagant, sweet.\r\n    Oh victim, thy joys are Meresa's,\r\n        Who died on the bosom Divine.\r\n    Her madness of rapture appeases\r\n        The hunger of soul that is thine!\r\n\r\n                    IV.\r\n\r\n    Inflammable impulse of beauty,\r\n        The breath of whose ardor is grief;\r\n    The God, in fulfilment of duty,\r\n        Hath stamped thee in highest relief!\r\n    From pots of auriferous metal,\r\n        Made pure by the torment of flame,\r\n    He pressed thee in fearful begettal,\r\n        A coinage too perfect for shame.\r\n\r\n                    V.\r\n\r\n    He made thee, most splendid, a flower,\r\n        A heavy sweet rose, to unfold\r\n    Some petals immortal, and shower\r\n        Their fragrance on earth frozen cold.\r\n    Oh golden-hued rose, in such fashion,\r\n        By the love of the world thou art sought\r\n    Thus flushed with the triumph of passion\r\n        Or pale with the splendor of thought!\r\n\r\n                    VI.\r\n\r\n    Oh soul, that inhales from the blossom\r\n        Delight in the rapture of breath,\r\n    A goddess aflame with her passion,\r\n        Ere beauty is wedded to death!\r\n    Oh virginal soul of the fountain,\r\n        Alive with the water of Youth,\r\n    All these, on the golden high mountain,\r\n        Thou dwellest, the image of Truth!\r\n\r\nWhat followed was an intoxicating medley of dancing, song and magic.\r\nCircles of the fairest girls, arrayed in the most ravishing costumes,\r\nmade the brain whirl with their gyrations. The oblation to the dancing\r\ngods wound up the performance, and the chorus of a thousand voices\r\nblended with the triumph of drums and explosions from musical\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nThe incomparable girl goddess then rose to her feet and waved the\r\nblessing of Harikar over the multitude. The girdle of gold that clung\r\nto her figure blazed with a thousand jewels. Her tiara sparkled with\r\nenormous diamonds that were blue as sapphires, amber as topazes, green\r\nas emeralds and red as rubies. Accompanied by the wailing of music,\r\nthe chant of megaphones, and the song of the enraptured people, she\r\nsank into the heart of the throne, glorious as she rose, herself its\r\nmost precious jewel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nAN AUDIENCE WITH THE SUPREME GODDESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palace of Tanje, situated about fifty miles from Calnogor, was the\r\nmetropolitan palace of the supreme goddess. It was sculptured out of a\r\nhill of white marble, as were also its walls, enclosing a garden a\r\nsquare mile in extent.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the programme prepared by his majesty, King\r\nAldemegry Bhoolmakar, we were to be received by her holiness Lyone in\r\nher palace at Tanje. The thought of meeting the adorable figure that\r\ncrowned the throne of the gods filled me with keenest delight.\r\n\r\nI seemed about to visit, not a human being like myself, but a\r\nveritable deity. What honor, what pleasure, it would be to speak to\r\nher face to face, heart to heart. Disguise it as I might, a feeling\r\nfor the goddess was being awakened in my soul. Was it the adoration of\r\nthe worshipper, or was it the dawn of a sacrilegious passion?\r\n\r\nIt seemed a monstrous idea for any one to love in the ordinary meaning\r\nof the term a being so high and holy. I could only worship her afar\r\noff, like any adoring citizen of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nHis majesty the king, together with Chief Minister Koshnili,\r\nCommander-in-Chief Coltonobory, Admiral Jolar and other dignitaries of\r\nthe kingdom, did us the honor to escort us to Tanje.\r\n\r\nThe method of travel between Calnogor and Tanje was by means of the\r\npneumatic tube, also a deity of invention. This consisted of a smooth\r\ntube six feet in diameter that curved over the country in a sinuous\r\nline, being supported on pillars at a height of twenty feet above the\r\nground. A decorative car of gold ornamented in enamelled colors rode\r\nthe crest of the tube, being connected with the piston inside. The car\r\nwas steadied between rails on either side and swept over the earth\r\nwith inconceivable rapidity. The distance from Calnogor to Tanje was\r\ntraversed in thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nA feeling of awe overcame the sailors as we approached the abode of\r\nthe living symbol of the Holy Soul.\r\n\r\nThe palace was a noble pile of masonry as it glittered in the\r\nperpendicular sunlight. It stood two stories in height and was\r\nsurmounted by a flattened central dome of colored glass, the ribs of\r\nthe dome being of solid gold. The lower story was surrounded by a\r\ncolonnade of pillars carved in the most grotesque shapes imaginable.\r\nThe grand entrance on the north side was constructed of alternating\r\npillars of platinum and gold, all three feet in thickness. From the\r\ntowers brilliant banners, emblazoned with the figure of the throne of\r\nthe gods, floated on the wind.\r\n\r\nThe apartments of the grand chamberlain were on the north side of the\r\npalace, where the pneumatic car was provided with a depot for the use\r\nof travellers.\r\n\r\nCleperelyum, the grand chamberlain, clad in white robes like an Arab\r\nchief, received us in the name of the goddess with marked deference\r\nand courtesy.\r\n\r\nA guard of honor consisting of a thousand wayleals was drawn up around\r\nthe palace. The audience chamber was a rectangular court in the centre\r\nof the building, whose ceiling was the roof of the palace itself,\r\nsurmounted by the dome peculiar to the palaces of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nThe hall leading to the presence chamber was lined with the priests\r\nand priestesses from Egyplosis in attendance on the goddess.\r\n\r\nLed by the grand chamberlain, we arrived at the golden doors of the\r\naudience chamber, which were opened by the servitors of the palace.\r\nWith trembling exultation I saw at the further end of the spacious\r\napartment a royal seat of violet velvet whereon sat Lyone, the supreme\r\ngoddess of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nAs my eyes rested upon the goddess she appeared still more divine than\r\nbefore. It seemed an unhallowed act that rough sailors should venture\r\ninto such spiritual precincts. We were awe-struck with the presence\r\nbefore us. As the grand chamberlain called out our names, we bowed low\r\nto that majestic spirit that seemed much more a deity than human\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HER HOLINESS OFFERED BOTH HIS MAJESTY THE KING AND\r\nMYSELF HER HAND TO KISS.]\r\n\r\nHer holiness greeted us with marked favor and offered both his majesty\r\nthe king and myself her hand to kiss. The high officials and my\r\nofficers and sailors were obliged to remain standing during the\r\naudience, according to the etiquette of the holy palace. His majesty\r\nthe king and myself were allowed to seat ourselves on an elevated dais\r\nbefore the goddess. When thus seated, I had leisure to observe that\r\nshe was arrayed in a single garment of quivering pale green silk, that\r\ncaressed every curve of her matchless figure and spread in myriad\r\nfolds about her limbs and feet. On her head she wore a model of the\r\njarcal, or bird of yearning, fashioned in precious terrelium. She wore\r\nalso a jewelled belt of gold. The breast was embroidered with a golden\r\nemblem of the throne of the gods, the sacred ensign of Atvatabar. On\r\nher neck were circles of rich rose pearls whose light gleamed soft on\r\nthe green lustre of her attire. On her head was the tiara of the\r\ngoddess, the triple crown of Harikar.\r\n\r\nHer holiness had an air of girlish frankness combined with royal\r\ndignity. She was so youthful that she could not have been more than\r\ntwenty years old. She possessed a charming presence and a clear and\r\nmusical voice. Her eyes were large and blue, and her finely-formed\r\nlips, like blood-red anemones, contrasted finely with the pale golden\r\nhue of her complexion.\r\n\r\nHer features combined the witchery of a houri with the strength of\r\nintellect. They were sculptured and illuminated by a grandly-developed\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nThe odor of a high and steadfast virtue surrounded her. It was not the\r\nvirtue of the ascetic, but rather that strength of soul that could\r\ntriumph over temptation, that loved fair lights, fine raiment, sweet\r\ncolors, and all the gladness and beauty of life.\r\n\r\nIn her soft right hand she bore a rod of divination, the spiritual\r\nsceptre of Atvatabar. On either side of her stood a twin soul in fond\r\nembrace as a guard of love.\r\n\r\nThe audience chamber was in itself a dream of grandeur and beauty.\r\nFrom the rose-tinted glass of the dome overhead a light soft and warm\r\nbathed all beneath with a peculiar sweetness. The lower part of the\r\nwalls resembled the cloisters of a mosque. Behind pillars of solid\r\nsilver a corridor ran all around the chamber. Here an artistic group\r\nof singers, clad in classic robes in soft colors, perambulated,\r\nsinging as they went a refrain of penetrating sweetness. The audience\r\nlistened with the deepest respect to the singing and to our\r\nconversation with the goddess. In the assembly were all the notables\r\nof the kingdom, poets, artists, musicians, inventors, sculptors, etc.,\r\nas well as royal and sacerdotal officers.\r\n\r\nThe singing of the choir, that moved like an apparition of spirits in\r\nthe dim cloisters, seemed to embody our thoughts and feelings. For\r\nmyself the divine song was a draught of joy. It was a breath of\r\nverdure, of flowers and fruits, of a warm and serene atmosphere made\r\nperfect by the presence of a peerless incarnation of man's universal\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE GODDESS LEARNS THE STORY OF THE OUTER WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHer holiness was pleased to say how honored she was by receiving us.\r\nOur advent in Atvatabar had created a profound impression upon the\r\npeople, and she was no less curious to see us and learn from our own\r\nlips the story of the outer world. She was greatly interested in\r\ncomparing the stalwart figures of our sailors with the less vigorous\r\nframes of the Atvatabarese. It could not be expected that men who\r\nhandled objects and carried themselves in a land where gravity was\r\nreduced to a minimum could be so vigorous as men who belonged to a\r\nland of enormous gravity, whose resistance to human activity developed\r\ngreat strength of bone and muscle.\r\n\r\nI informed her holiness regarding the geography, climate and peoples\r\nof the outer sphere. I gave her an account of the chief nations of the\r\nworld from Japan to the United States. I spoke of Africa, Australia,\r\nand the Pacific islands. I spoke of Adam and Eve, of the Deluge, of\r\nAssyria and Egypt. Then I described the glory of Greece and the\r\ngrandeur of Rome. I spoke of Caesar and Hannibal, Cleopatra and\r\nAntony. I spoke of Columbus, Galileo, Michael Angelo, Faraday, Dante,\r\nand Shakespeare. I described how art reigned in one kingdom or country\r\nand invention in another, and that the soul or spiritual nature was as\r\nyet a rare development.\r\n\r\n\"You tell me,\" said the goddess, \"that Greece could chisel a statue,\r\nbut could not invent a magnic engine, and that your own country, rich\r\nin machinery, is barren in art. This tells me the outer world is yet\r\nin a state of chaos and has not yet reached the development of\r\nAtvatabar. We have passed through all those stages. At first we were\r\nbarbarous, then, as time produced order, art began to flourish. The\r\nartist, in his desire to glorify the few, lost sight of the misery of\r\nthe many. Then came the reign of invention, of science, giving power\r\nto the meanest citizen. As democracy triumphed art was despised, and\r\na ribald press jeered at the sacred names of poet and priest. By\r\ndegrees, as the pride and power of the wealthy few were curbed and the\r\ncondition of the masses raised to a more uniform and juster level,\r\nuniversal prosperity, growing rapidly richer, produced a fusion of art\r\nand progress. The physical man made powerful by science and the soul\r\ndeveloped by art naturally produced the result of spiritual freedom.\r\nThe enfranchised soul became free to explore the mysteries of nature\r\nand obtain a mastery over the occult forces residing therein.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the outer sphere,\" I informed the goddess, \"there has also existed\r\nin all ages an ardent longing for spiritual power over matter. But\r\nthis power, which in many periods of history was really obtained, had\r\nbeen purchased by putting in practice the severest austerities of the\r\nbody. Force of soul was the price of subjugation of passion and the\r\nvarious appetites of the body. The fakirs, yogis, jugglers, and adepts\r\nof India; the magicians, sorcerers and astrologers of Mesopotamia and\r\nEgypt; the alchemists, cabalists, and wizards of the middle ages, and\r\nthe theosophists, spiritualists, clairvoyants, and mesmerists of the\r\npresent time, were members of the same fraternity who have obtained\r\ntheir psychological powers from a study and practice of mystic\r\nphilosophy or magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say that the outer-world magicians derived their powers of soul\r\nfrom abnegation of the body,\" said the goddess. \"Now the soul priests\r\nof Atvatabar can do quite as wonderful things, I dare say, as your\r\nmagicians, and they have never practised austerities, but, on the\r\ncontrary, have developed the body as well as the soul. In the worship\r\nof the gods of science and invention, art and spirituality, both body,\r\nmind, and soul are exercised to their utmost capability. In all stages\r\nthere is exultance, exercise, development. But I am deeply interested\r\nin your remarks. Tell me just what the principles of the worshippers\r\nof your Harikar are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spiritual culture in the outer world,\" I explained, \"is obtained by a\r\nvariety of religious beliefs, but the belief that most nearly\r\nresembles that of Atvatabar is that of the soul-worshippers, who deny\r\nthe existence of any power beyond the human soul, teaching that it is\r\nonly by our own inward light that we can rise to higher planes and\r\nreach at last to Nirvana, or passive blessedness. This inward light\r\ncan only be truly followed by self-obliteration, fastings, penances,\r\nand repression of desires and appetites of all kinds, carried on\r\nthrough an endless series of reincarnations. The final blessedness is\r\na beatific absorption into the ocean of existence which pervades the\r\nuniverse.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a different creed to that of Harikar in Atvatabar,\" said the\r\ngoddess, \"which is worship of body, mind, and soul. We believe with\r\nyour Greeks in perfection of body and also with your Hindoos in\r\nperfection of soul. We re-enforce the powers of body and mind by\r\nscience and invention, and the soul powers by art and spiritual love.\r\nWe believe in magic and sorcery. Our religion is a state of ecstatic\r\njoy, chiefly found in the cultured friendship of counterpart souls,\r\nwho form complete circles with each other. Enduring youth is the\r\nconsummate flower of civilization. With us it lasts one hundred years,\r\nbeginning with our twentieth birthday. There is no long and crucial\r\nstage of bodily abstinence from the good things of life; there is only\r\nabstinence from evil, from vice, selfishness, and unholy desire. Our\r\nreligion is the trinity of body, mind, and spirit, in their utmost\r\ndevelopment. Such is the faith of Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\n\"And such a faith,\" I replied, \"with such a deity as your holiness,\r\nmust profoundly sway the hearts of your people.\"\r\n\r\nThe goddess was a woman of intuition. Almost before I was aware of it\r\nmyself she evidently discovered a sentiment underlying my words. She\r\npaused a moment, and before I could question her further regarding the\r\npeculiar creed of Atvatabar, said: \"We will discuss these things more\r\nfully hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nAt a signal from the goddess the trumpets rang a blast announcing the\r\naudience at an end. With the summons music uttered a divine throbbing\r\nthroughout the chamber, while the singers marched and sang gloriously\r\nin the cloisters.\r\n\r\nAs I sat, my soul swimming in a sea of ecstasy born of the blessed\r\nenvironment, I felt possessed of splendors and powers hitherto unknown\r\nand unfelt. A thrill of joy made hearts tremble beneath the crystal\r\ndome. It was a new lesson in art's mysterious peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GARDEN OF TANJE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA series of banquets and other entertainments followed each other\r\nduring our stay at the palace of Tanje. The goddess had held frequent\r\ninterviews with the professors and myself regarding the external\r\nsphere, and had examined our maps and charts with the greatest\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nHis majesty did not take nearly so much interest in our revelations as\r\nthe goddess, being inert and prosaic in character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lilasure.]\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day of our stay at the palace of Tanje I\r\nreceived a visit from the grand chamberlain Cleperelyum, with a\r\ncommand from the goddess to meet her in her boudoir. Cleperelyum led\r\nme to the sacred apartment, which, when I entered, was vacant. The\r\nwalls were models of decorative architecture, the panels being filled\r\nwith silk tapestry of a pale yellow-green hue, the mouldings being\r\nivory-white. The panelled frieze was filled with figures in violet and\r\ngold, and sea-green upholstery covered couch and divan, while the\r\ndraperies were silks of cream and blue. It was a luxurious retreat.\r\nThe carpet was a silk rug, soft as a bed of rose leaves, with a broad\r\nborder in tones of green, violet and white.\r\n\r\nPresently the goddess entered with a winning smile on her features.\r\nShe was arrayed in a dress of soft violet silk, that, apparently, had\r\nno other garment beneath, so perfect was the revelation of her figure.\r\nBeneath the figure it fell to the ground in a thousand folds, like a\r\nwave of smooth water bursting into foaming rapids. Round her neck was\r\na garland of lustrous yellow pearls. On her head she wore a tiara of\r\nmuch smaller dimensions than that worn on public occasions. Her pose\r\nwas upright as an arrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Laburnul.]\r\n\r\nI rose and bowed profoundly, and the goddess also bowing, requested me\r\nto be seated.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent for you,\" said she, \"to learn more about your country and\r\nto talk with you about ours. I am consumed with curiosity regarding\r\nthe external world.\" \"Your holiness,\" I replied, \"permit me to say\r\nthat your graceful condescension exceeds, if possible, your splendor.\r\nI am truly bewildered at the vastness of my good fortune in\r\ndiscovering a country ruled by so glorious a goddess.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I also,\" said the goddess, \"have learned that Bilbimtesirol is\r\nnot the universe, but a very small portion thereof indeed. I am\r\nintensely interested in your accounts of the outer world. I am\r\noverpowered with the thought that the exterior surface of the planet\r\nis peopled with beings like ourselves, and that civilization,\r\ngovernment, religion, art, manufacture, and social life are so greatly\r\ndeveloped beneath a still more glorious sun than ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it never occur to your astronomers,\" I inquired, \"that human\r\nactivity might also pervade the outer sphere?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Green Gazzle of Glockett Gozzle.]\r\n\r\n\"Our astronomers,\" said the goddess, \"have long since decided that the\r\nconditions of climate on the exterior planet were too severe to allow\r\nhuman life to exist. They are aware that a great luminary gave the\r\nouter earth light by day, for our most daring aerial voyagers have\r\nfrequently caught a glimpse of its light seen through the polar gulf.\r\nThey argued that the equatorial regions were too hot, and the polar\r\nregions too cold, to support life, consequently the outer earth was a\r\nbarren waste as desolate and uninhabited as your own satellite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would your holiness like to visit the exterior earth?\" I boldly\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"If duty did not prevent me,\" she replied, \"I would love to visit\r\nthose far-off strange lands and peoples and see your sun and moon and\r\nall the stars!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the goddess I first learned the precise location of Atvatabar.\r\nLying exactly underneath the Atlantic Ocean it stretched east and west\r\nsome two thousand miles, surrounded by the interior sea. There were\r\nother continents in Bilbimtesirol which we had already dimly seen\r\nspread upon the concave walls of the world around us.\r\n\r\n\"You must come to see both Egyplosis and Arjeels,\" said her holiness,\r\n\"but before you leave Tanje you must see my garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a little paradise!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go and see it now,\" she said, and, so saying, arose with a\r\ngracious gesture and led me out of the apartment.\r\n\r\nI accompanied her holiness down the terrace leading to the lovely\r\nretreat. Curving walks led between banks of flowers of all hues.\r\nThere were avenues of tall shrubs not unlike rhododendrons, with the\r\nsame magnificent bloom. Other plants, such as the firesweet, displayed\r\na blinding wealth of yellow flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jeerloons.]\r\n\r\nThe goddess led the way to the conservatory in the garden wherein were\r\ntreasured strange and beautiful flowers and zoophytes illustrative of\r\nthe gradual evolution of animals from plants, a scientific faith that\r\nheld sway in Atvatabar. The goddess showed me a beautiful plant with\r\nlarge fan-shaped leaves from whose edges hung a fringe of heavy roses;\r\nlong trailing garlands of clustering star-shaped flowers sprang from\r\nthe same roots. The plant was a perfect bower of bliss, and while\r\ncalled the laburnul, might with greater propriety be styled the rose\r\nof paradise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Jeerloon.]\r\n\r\nAnother fern-like plant was in reality a bird flower, called the\r\nlilasure. It had the head and breast of a bird, from whose back grew\r\nroots and four small feathers resembling those of the peacock. Its\r\ntail resembled two large fronds of a fern, which served the animal for\r\nwings, for by their aid it flew through the air.\r\n\r\nThere was also a flock of strange green-feathered creatures,\r\nresembling buzzards, called green gazzles, on whose heads grew\r\nsun-flowers. On either side, beneath their wings, were the plant roots\r\nby means of which they still sucked nourishment from the soil, as\r\ntheir bills were not yet perfectly developed. They belonged to a\r\nlocality on the south coast of Atvatabar known as Glockett Gozzle.\r\n\r\nThe lillipoutum was another wonderful creature, half-plant half-bird.\r\nIt represented the animal almost entirely evolved from the plant\r\nstage. A wreath of rootlets adorned the neck, but the most conspicuous\r\nfeatures were the stork-like legs that terminated in roots with\r\nradiations like encrinital stems. The bird fed itself like a plant by\r\nsimply thrusting its root-legs into the soft ooze of lake bottoms and\r\nslimy banks of rivers. Its tail was also a root possessing great\r\nabsorptive powers. In shape the bird resembled a flamingo, and its\r\nfeathers were of an old-rose color, mottled with lichen-green. A\r\nbeard-like radiation of roots decorated its head, and its bill was\r\nextremely delicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lillipoutum.]\r\n\r\nSuch wonders as these intensified the glamor of the interior world. I\r\nwas fast becoming bewildered with the intoxication of an environment\r\nof strange, abnormal creatures--unlike anything I had ever seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe goddess regarded her pets with the greatest interest, and was\r\npleased at being the first to acquaint me with such living wonders of\r\nAtvatabar.\r\n\r\n\"Your holiness,\" I said, \"these creatures are so wonderful that unless\r\nI had actually seen them it would be impossible for me to believe in\r\ntheir existence.\" As I spoke, two strange bat-like forms flew toward\r\nus; they were flying orchids, known as jeerloons, with heart-shaped\r\nfaces and arms terminating in wire-like claws. Their wing projections\r\nwere bristling with suckers like the rays of a starfish. Altogether\r\nthey were weird, uncanny creatures. The goddess caught one of them in\r\nher hands, and laughed at my excitement. \"They will haunt you in your\r\ndreams,\" she exclaimed, \"poor, pretty things!\"\r\n\r\n\"But now,\" she added, \"let me show you a plant that is fast becoming\r\na brood of animals, both root and flower. It is the jugdul. Still\r\nrooted in the soil, strange faces are swelling in the mould, while the\r\nflower is a leaf surmounted by a weird, small head, the nasal organ of\r\nwhich is a ponderous proboscis. We do not know as yet what kind of\r\nanimal life will evolve from the plant, but the botanists and\r\nphysiologists of Atvatabar are agreed that at least two new species of\r\nanimals will be developed when the evolution of the zoophyte is\r\ncomplete.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Jugdul.]\r\n\r\nI assured her holiness that I considered myself the most favored of\r\nmen to be permitted to visit the sanctuary wherein the occult\r\ntransmigration of life was being manifested. It was a rare experience!\r\n\r\nJust then the goddess directed my attention to a flying root\r\nresembling a humming-bird. It was the far-famed jalloast, the\r\nsemi-evolved humming-bird of Atvatabar. Other similar beings,\r\nhalf-root, half-bird, were seen perched in a bower of tree-ferns,\r\nwhose waxy green fronds fell like an emerald cascade about the\r\njalloasts.\r\n\r\nFrom porcelain boxes suspended along the roof of the conservatory a\r\nperfect forest of strange plants depended, a species of zoophyte known\r\nas the yarp-happy, which seemed to be a combination of ape and\r\nflower. Its peculiarly weird, ape-like face was covered with a hood,\r\nand from the open mouth of each animal the tongue protruded. From the\r\nneck of the animal three long leaves radiated, the two lower leaves in\r\neach case terminating in claw-like extremities, which gave a weird\r\nexpression to the zoophyte.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Yarphappy.]\r\n\r\nRight underneath these strange beings, there grew an immense quantity\r\nof spotted pouch-shaped plants, each having the head of a cat growing\r\nabove the pouch. This peculiar zoophyte was known as the gasternowl.\r\nFrom either side of the junction of the cat-like head with the pouch\r\nradiated two speckled leaves. The tips of the ears terminated in\r\nfrond-like plumes, and a peculiar plume like a crest surmounted the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nA strange root known as the crocosus was developed into a perfect\r\nanimal that crawled with four legs upon the floor. The animal was not\r\nunlike the lizard, or a diminutive crocodile, with an immensely long\r\nneck, which it held erect. The neck terminated in a bulbous head, with\r\nan open, bill-shaped mouth, not unlike the mouth of a pelican, while\r\nright below the jaws there grew a root-like appendage, that coiled\r\naround the neck. The animal possessed a root-like tail, and was a most\r\ninteresting creature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Jalloast.]\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the wonders of the conservatory of plant\r\ntransmigration at Tanje would be impossible. I saw the jardil (or\r\nlove-pouch), an orchid resembling a pouch, with the face of a child\r\ngrowing therein, from which radiated rootlets and jabots of spiral\r\nfronds. I also saw the redoubtable blocus, an animal resembling a\r\njerboa, or kangaroo, whose only trace of plant existence was a few\r\nrootlets growing out of its back. The funny-fenny, or clowngrass, was\r\na weed with veritable goblins growing on the stems. The goblins had\r\nlong noses and wore high hats and lace collars, but were otherwise but\r\nplants with absorbent roots. They were so grotesque that I began to\r\nthink that nature was laughing at me quite as much as I laughed at\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWhen leaving the conservatory I heard a chorus of tender voices like a\r\nband of spirits singing, whereupon the goddess directed my attention\r\nto a cluster of fairy girls that, like flowers, were growing upon the\r\nstem of a plant. It was a peculiarity of these fairy creatures to\r\nsing every time their goddess passed by, her spiritual atmosphere\r\nquickening them into conscious life and song. I was fairly dazzled\r\nwith such a tribute of love to my gracious companion, and were the\r\nfairy flowers not sacred things I would have borne them away to\r\nexhibit such a trophy to the outer world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Gasternowl.]\r\n\r\nThis wonderful plant seemed more like the production of spirit power\r\nindulging in a weird fantasy of imagination, rather than an evolution\r\nof nature. It was a new experience to me to hear the little creatures\r\nsing in a tender chorus of adoration to the goddess and dance\r\ngleefully upon their stems. My guide fondled the strange creatures\r\nwith her own fair fingers, and they seemed to me the greatest wonder I\r\nhad yet beheld in Atvatabar.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" said the goddess, \"are gleroserals, and I would gladly give\r\nyou a spray were it not that removal from their tender habitat would\r\nkill them. But here is a flower, half-bird, half-plant, that I will\r\nsend you in a proper cage if you care for it.\" The zoophyte referred\r\nto was another bird plant that flew around the conservatory possessing\r\nthe head and body of an eagle, the wings of a butterfly and the tail\r\nof a plant. The plant-like appendage was composed of long beautiful\r\nsprays of graceful foliage, not unlike pine branches, that were curved\r\ninto sinuous forms as the animal flew. It was known as the eaglon, and\r\nwas without legs. I thanked the goddess for her precious gift,\r\nwhereupon we left the conservatory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Crocosus.]\r\n\r\nWandering through thickets of roses whose burning blossoms swooned\r\nupon their stems, we came upon a thick carpet of verdure that\r\nsurrounded a hidden lake of clear, cool water. The rocky basin of the\r\nlake had been sculptured by human hands. Its margin was in outline a\r\nbold pear-shaped curve, that also curved upon itself, formed by an\r\nimmense chiselling of the fundamental rock. In a little harbor of cut\r\nrock lay a pleasure boat, a curiously-wrought shell of silver that was\r\npropelled by magnicity. The goddess entered the boat, bidding me\r\nfollow her. We sat together on an ample couch in the stern of the boat\r\nunderneath a silver canopy. Touching a button, the boat moved swiftly\r\nover the water. It was a scene of rapture! Gazing into the depths of\r\nthe water I saw the bottom of the lake sculptured in immense masses of\r\nflowers of stone, like the roof of a Gothic cathedral, but a hundred\r\ntimes more luxuriant. Around and above us rose heights of blessedness\r\nfilled with all the thousand ecstasies of leaf and flower. An islet\r\nbore a little pagoda that stood in the eternal noon a pillared jewel\r\nof stone, silent and beautiful. It was half concealed with festoons of\r\ncreeping plants whose flowers were great globes of crimson, yellow and\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nThere was around me--paradise, and beside me--ecstasy!\r\n\r\n\"You are pleased with my garden?\" said the goddess.\r\n\r\n\"This must be the garden of Hesperides that our poets write of,\" I\r\nreplied. \"Here at last I have found the ideal life.\"\r\n\r\nThe goddess reclined on the couch in an attitude of luxurious grace.\r\nHer every gesture was at once heroic and beautiful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Jardil, or Love-Pouch.]\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what your poets say of nature, life and love,\" said she; \"do\r\nthey ever sing the delights of hopeless love?\"\r\n\r\nAs the goddess uttered this last question I felt within me a strange\r\ndelight. There sat beside me, floating on that mysterious wave, the\r\nidol of a great nation, the deity of its universal faith, a divinity\r\nof power, glory and beauty, laying aside spiritual empire to become\r\nthe companion of a simple explorer of the internal world, her\r\ndiscoverer and her friend, by a most happy chance of fortune.\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts swiftly ran through my brain, and before I had time\r\nto reply, music, soft, weird, intensely intoxicating, was blown from\r\namong the tempestuous bloom of the paradises. The melody seemed the\r\nholiest thrill of hearts communing in the rapture of love! To explain\r\nthe sweetness of the moment is impossible--the goddess was so alluring\r\nand serene. She kept her own emotions in the background as the result\r\nof a proud devotion to duty, and yet I felt swathed with a soul that\r\nseemed to have found an opportunity worthy the expression of its life.\r\n\r\nA situation so daring, yet so tender, required an equally daring and\r\nreverent soul to meet it. I felt all its surpassing loveliness.\r\n\r\n\"Our poets,\" I replied, \"have written of love in all its phases,\r\ndescribing the most spiritual passions as well as the most lustful. In\r\npoetry love may be any phase of love, but the reality is a compound of\r\nlust and spirituality, being rooted both in body and soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do your people,\" said the goddess, \"never differentiate lust and love\r\nand obtain in real life only a spiritual romantic love such as we do\r\nin Atvatabar?\"\r\n\r\n\"We believe, your holiness,\" I replied, \"that such a love as you refer\r\nto is only to be found in a spiritual state and is the secret of\r\ndisembodied blessedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must see Egyplosis,\" said she, \"ere you depart from us, and there\r\nlearn the possibility of ideal love in actual life.\"\r\n\r\n\"To discover such a joy,\" I replied, \"will repay my journey to\r\nAtvatabar a thousandfold.\"\r\n\r\nWe alighted from the boat on a rocky margin of the lake that led into\r\na labyrinth of flowers. Here we wandered at will, discovering at every\r\nstep new delights. Lyone was not only a goddess, but also the fond\r\nincarnation of a comrade soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY TO EGYPLOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever did time pass so rapidly or so happily as the days spent in the\r\npalace of the goddess. Although I met Lyone at the daily banquets and\r\nat our scientific discussions with the astronomers, naturalists,\r\nchemists, geologists, physicians and philosophers of Atvatabar, yet\r\nneither by look nor gesture did she betray the slightest memory of\r\nthat ravishing scene in her garden only a few days before.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I asked myself, Was it possible that that calm and\r\ncrowned goddess of the pantheon was a being that could feel thrilled\r\nwith ordinary human ecstasy? Would I, most daring of men, ever be\r\npermitted to kiss that far-off mouth divine, and not be slain by one\r\ndreadful glance of contempt?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Blocus.]\r\n\r\nOur discussions terminated in an invitation by the goddess to\r\naccompany her in her aerial yacht, the _Aeropher_, to Egyplosis,\r\nwhither, according to the sacred calendar, she must proceed to take\r\npart in the ceremony of the installation of a twin soul. Her holiness,\r\ntheir majesties the king and queen, myself and officers of the _Polar\r\nKing_, together with the chief minister Koshnili, the military, civil\r\nand naval officers, the poets, savants, artists, and musicians of\r\nAtvatabar, would sail in the yacht of the goddess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Funny-Fenny, or Clowngrass.]\r\n\r\nA host of lesser dignitaries, including the sailors of the _Polar\r\nKing_ under command of Flathootly, would follow us in another yacht,\r\ncalled the _Fletyeming_. Each yacht had its own priest-captain,\r\nofficers and crew of aerial navigators.\r\n\r\nEach yacht consisted of a deck of fine woven cane, compact as steel,\r\nwoven with great skill, with cabins, staterooms, etc., of the same\r\nmaterial erected thereon, and high bamboo bulwarks to prevent the\r\nvoyagers falling off the deck.\r\n\r\nThe propelling apparatus consisted of two large wheels, having\r\nnumerous aerial fans that alternately beat backward and cut through\r\nthe air as they oscillated on their axes. The wheels were supplemented\r\nby aeroplanes, resembling huge outspreading wings, inclined at an\r\nangle, so that their forward rush upon the air supported the ship.\r\nThey revolved with great rapidity, being driven by the accumulated\r\nforce of a thousand magnic batteries, composed of dry metallic cells,\r\nespecially designed for aerial navigation. Very little force was\r\nrequired to keep the vessel buoyed up in the air, owing to the\r\ndiminished gravity.\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that the rarer metals terrelium and aquelium\r\ndeveloped in contact, without salts or acids, enormous currents of\r\nmagnicity without polarization or the development of gases. These\r\nmetallic cells would run without attention or maintenance exerting\r\nmagnic action, and could be stopped or started at any time without\r\ncorrosion of metals or loss of energy, like the electric batteries on\r\nthe outer sphere, but infinitely more powerful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Gleroseral.]\r\n\r\nAerial navigation was one of the great institutions of Atvatabar, and\r\nthe goddess' yacht was only one of many thousand aerial ships that\r\ncarried passengers, mails and light freight to and from every part of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nOn such a machine as this we purposed travelling a distance of one\r\nthousand miles.\r\n\r\nFive hundred miles west of Calnogor lay a range of lofty mountains,\r\nwhose peaks pierced the upper strata of cold air. This region was the\r\nbreeding-place of fearful storms that occasionally vexed the otherwise\r\nplacid climate of the country.\r\n\r\nWestward of the mountains, an elevated prairie or tableland extended\r\nfor five hundred miles further, broken here and there into crevasses\r\nand canyons, the beds of mighty rivers. Beyond the prairie an irregular\r\nagglomeration of mountains and valleys stretched five hundred miles\r\nfurther until the ocean was reached which formed the western boundary\r\nof Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nEgyplosis, or the sacred palace, stood on an island in a lake lying in\r\na romantic valley of the central plateau, one thousand miles west of\r\nCalnogor. This was the destination of the _Aeropher_, the goddess\r\nmaking a special visitation to the palace of hopeless love.\r\n\r\nNo journey could have begun with better auspices than ours. We soared\r\nup the grand divide, underneath the brilliant sun, which threw the\r\nmoving shadow of the ship on the earth beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Eaglon.]\r\n\r\nCaptain Lavornal, the inventor of the _Aeropher_, was resolved to\r\noutdo all former records in aerial navigation, and accordingly drove\r\nthe _Aeropher_ at a speed of eighty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe captain explained to me that he was using the wheels simply to\r\nlift the ship over the mountains. Once over these the wheels that were\r\nbeing used to lift the ship would thus propel her, when her normal\r\nspeed of two hundred miles an hour would be reached.\r\n\r\nLyone was in a particularly happy mood. \"I like aerial travelling so\r\nmuch,\" said she, \"because it is the nearest mechanical approach to the\r\nnature of the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"What relation to the soul can the ship possibly possess?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you see,\" said she, \"that our travelling approaches nearer\r\nto that of the spiritual state than any other mode? We can at will\r\nsweep up into heaven or descend to earth. We are independent of\r\nobstacles. Rivers and roads, mountains and seas have no terrors for\r\nus. Then the infinite daring of it all--oh! it is to me delightful.\"\r\n\r\nHigher and yet higher mounted the ship up the steeps of the continent\r\nuntil we plunged into a grisly pass. On either side the huge shoulders\r\nof the mountains lifted up forests of pines and cedars, whose colossal\r\ntrunks seemed the gateways of a new world. The ship indeed possessed\r\nsome of the attributes of a soul. It could plunge us into sublimity or\r\ndeath, lift up to the very sun itself, or, like a disembodied soul,\r\nskim the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe mountains once crossed, we swept down their declivities toward the\r\nprairies with tremendous speed. The propellers seemed powerful enough\r\nto control the ship in the fiercest storm. The inner world lay spread\r\nout beneath us like a map in relief. There was a strange absence of\r\nshadow caused by a perpendicular sun that realized the climate of\r\nDante,\r\n\r\n     \"A land whereon no shadow falls.\"\r\n\r\nYet as the _Aeropher_ swept onward her shadow could be seen drifting\r\nover cornfields, miles of rustling wheat and pastures where the cattle\r\nstarted and fled from the apparition in the sky.\r\n\r\nWe were admiring the beauty of the panorama beneath, when the sky\r\nbecame suddenly overcast with clouds, obscuring the light of the sun.\r\nThis was so unexpected an occurrence that Lyone and myself looked at\r\neach other in alarm.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lavornal exclaimed: \"Your holiness, I apprehend these clouds\r\nare the couriers of a hurricane!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that we shall be overtaken by the storm?\" asked Lyone.\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly,\" said the captain, \"and I tremble lest anything\r\nshould happen to your holiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear for me,\" said Lyone; \"even a storm is not\r\ninsurmountable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I descend, your holiness, or keep to our course?\" inquired the\r\ncaptain with some trepidation.\r\n\r\n\"Keep to your course,\" replied Lyone.\r\n\r\nJust then a hollow booming was heard, and then a fierce explosion in\r\nwhich the darkened sky became enveloped in a sheet of flame.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the cyclone struck the ship!\r\n\r\nSome of the terrified voyagers shrieked and others remained silent,\r\nbut all held tightly on to the nearest thing they could get hold of.\r\n\r\nThe ship lay at an angle of forty-five degrees from the plane of the\r\nrotating storm, having been caught by the wind with a fearful shock,\r\nsnapping several of the cables that bound cabins and decks together.\r\nStrangely enough, the ship did not become a wreck, but was blown out\r\nof its course, the toy of the wind. We lost sight of the other ship\r\ncontaining the sailors, and could certainly only care for ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe cyclone proved to be a storm five hundred miles in diameter. The\r\ncurrents of air most remote from the centre did not sweep round in the\r\nsame uniform plane. The entire circumference of wind was composed of\r\ntwo enormous waves each seven hundred and fifty miles in length and\r\nfour miles in perpendicular height. It was as if the rings of Saturn\r\nhad suddenly assumed a vertical as well as a spinning motion, and both\r\nmovements of the storm produced an appalling splendor of flight\r\nhitherto unknown to human sensation. Can the _Aeropher_ survive the\r\nroaring storm? was the thought of every heart. Bravery was of no avail\r\nwith the destroying force that had so suddenly overwhelmed us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nESCAPING FROM THE CYCLONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship, lifting her prow, would spring into the sky upon the bosom\r\nof the whirling waste of air. The sun was completely obscured by dense\r\nmasses of flying clouds and we were deluged with torrents of water.\r\nThe terror of the situation obliterated all thoughts of country or\r\nhome or friends. All worldly consciousness had evaporated from the\r\npale beings that in despair held on to the ship for life or death.\r\n\r\nThe ravages of the storm on the earth beneath could be heard with\r\nstartling distinctness. We heard at times the roaring of forests and\r\nsaw the shrieking, whirling branches in every earth-illuminating flash\r\nof lightning.\r\n\r\nThe goddess stood holding on to the outer rail of the deck, the\r\nincarnation of courage. She had risen to meet the danger at its worst.\r\n\r\nThe _Aeropher_ having risen to an enormous height, being thrown\r\ncompletely out of the tempest as if shot from a catapult, turned to\r\ndescend again. It flew downward like an arrow, filling every soul,\r\nsave perhaps that of Lyone, with fear. All were resigned for death;\r\nthere could be no escape from the destruction that threatened us.\r\n\r\nAll this time the centre of the storm had been travelling to the\r\nsoutheast, or about forty-five degrees out of our proper course.\r\nSuddenly the ship shot downward from the southeastern limb of the\r\nstorm, which almost reached the earth at this point. Gazing below, we\r\ndiscovered a fearful chasm in the face of the earth toward which we\r\nwere rapidly flying. It was the canyon of the river Savagil, a\r\nmerciless abyss ten thousand feet in depth.\r\n\r\nFrightful as was the scene, it might yet prove our salvation if the\r\nship could escape colliding with the precipitous walls. Were there no\r\nabyss we would certainly be dashed to pieces on the earth itself.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the ship heeled over fifty degrees, flinging its living\r\nfreight violently against the houses on deck and the lower rail. But\r\nwe were saved! One side of the deck grazed the precipice as it plunged\r\ninto the canyon. We had passed through the danger before knowing what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nLyone was stunned, but safe, the captain had a dislocated wrist, and\r\nothers had broken limbs, but none was fatally hurt.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible experience.\r\n\r\nAs the canyon of the river led in a northeasterly direction we did not\r\nemerge from the shelter it gave us to seek fresh conflict with the\r\ncyclone, but kept flying between the formidable walls. We soon knew by\r\nthe returning sunlight and the silver clouds that the hurricane had\r\ndied away.\r\n\r\nThe damage done to the _Aeropher_ was quickly repaired. The ceaseless\r\nhumming of the fans revolving on axles of hollow steel lulled our\r\nsenses once more into dreamy repose.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Lyone, \"this is life. I feel as though I were a bird or\r\ndisembodied spirit. This aerial navigation is the realization of those\r\naspirations of men that they might like birds possess the sky. Some\r\nhave wished to enjoy submarine travel, to explore those frightful\r\nabysses of ocean where sea-monsters dwell; to behold the conflict of\r\nsharks in their native element, to see the swordfish bury his spear in\r\nthe colossal whale. I prefer this upper sphere of sunlight and the\r\ndome of forests, mountains, and valleys of the dear old earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said I; \"the world into which we are born is our true\r\nhabitat.\"\r\n\r\nThe walls of the canyon grew wider apart until we floated in a valley\r\ntwo miles wide. The meadow land below us was carpeted with grass and\r\ncovered with clumps of forest trees, down the middle of which ran the\r\nriver, green and swift. The walls of the valley here rose twelve\r\nthousand feet in perpendicular height, prodigies of stone, stained in\r\nbarbaric colors by the brushes of the ages. Here and there triumphant\r\ncataracts flashed from the heights and fell in torrents of foam to the\r\nvalley below. Sometimes a tributary of the river dashed furiously\r\nfrom the battlements above us into the abyss, flinging clouds of spray\r\non the tops of the trees beneath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GODDESS STOOD HOLDING THE OUTER RAIL OF THE DECK,\r\nTHE INCARNATION OF COURAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe _Aeropher_ maintained a uniform height of five thousand feet,\r\nsufficiently high to give us the exultation of a bird, yet\r\nsufficiently deep to allow the sublimity of the scene to fully impress\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe musicians, who had hitherto remained in abeyance, now broke the\r\nsilence of our progress with a swelling refrain. The music rolled\r\nechoing from granite to jasper walls in strains of divine pathos. We\r\nseemed to sail through the fabled realms of enchantment. In that\r\nlittle moving heaven, ceremony was dissolved into a thrilling\r\nfriendship; the harmonious surroundings created a closer union of\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nAbove where I sat with Lyone there floated a flag of yellow silk a\r\nhundred feet in length. As it floated on the wind it assumed a varying\r\nseries of poetic shapes, very beautiful to witness.\r\n\r\nSometimes there was a long sinuous fold, then a number of rippling\r\nwaves, then a second fold only shorter than the first, then more\r\nrippling waves. It was a symbol of the soul and of the goddess, and\r\nrepresented the fascination and poetry that belongs to the adepts of\r\nHarikar. Its folds changed momentarily. At times there would be one\r\nlarge central curve like a Moorish arch, flanked on either side by a\r\nnumber of lesser arches. Again the flag streamed in throbbing waves,\r\nfrequently blown by an intense breath of wind straight as a spear,\r\ncrackling and shivering like a soul in pain. It responded not only to\r\nthe motion of the ship, but had an independent life of its own.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" said Lyone, \"that the spiritual part of our creed is but\r\nthe development of this independent life of the soul. The spiritual\r\nnature responds to the opportunity worthy of its recognition.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is but the mechanical law of cause and effect,\" I ventured;\r\n\"where does self-sacrifice come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not quite understand,\" she replied; \"self-sacrifice is the first\r\nlaw of the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I mean,\" I said, \"is this--having discovered your counterpart,\r\ndo you adore despite the circumstances of fortune?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly,\" she replied; \"there is the divinest self-sacrifice\r\non both sides as far as the fortunes of each will permit. Ideally, the\r\nsacrifice is unlimited, but practically is limited as to time,\r\nopportunity and other circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the counterpart soul loved in spite of disparity of circumstances,\r\nor is an equality of circumstances, such as rank, wealth and\r\nnationality, etc., a factor in the case?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Outward circumstances have nothing whatever to do with the matter,\"\r\nsaid Lyone. \"Friends, wealth, rank, everything is thrown aside in\r\nfavor of the inward circumstance that the two souls are one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I urged, \"you expose your spiritual creed to very violent\r\nshocks at times. The king of to-day may be a beggar to-morrow, and,\r\nbesides, one or both of two souls may before they have known each\r\nother have been freighted with lifelong responsibilities. How, then,\r\ndo you prevent a catastrophe to some one?\"\r\n\r\n\"I admit,\" she said, \"that as far as the every-day world is concerned,\r\nthere are serious difficulties to contend with. But we avoid these by\r\ncreating a little world of our own, exclusively for the cultivation of\r\nthe spiritual soul. Just as some people apply themselves to physical\r\nculture to become athletes and show how grand the physical man may\r\nbecome, so we set apart a number of people as soul-priests to develop\r\nspirituality, or power over themselves and others and power over\r\nmatter. It was for this object that Egyplosis was founded, to form a\r\nfitting environment for those who have achieved the ideal life. This\r\nlife fully ripened, with its fresh and glorious enjoyment, can be\r\nmaintained for a hundred years without diminution or loss of ecstasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you mean that, after living one hundred years, beginning with\r\nyour twentieth birthday, you are still only commencing your\r\ntwenty-first year?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what I mean,\" said Lyone. \"I myself have lived ten\r\nyears of Nirvana, and am yet only twenty years old.\"\r\n\r\nI could well believe that such glorious freshness and beauty as hers\r\nwas quite as young as she had represented it; but it was a strange\r\nidea--this achievement of an earthly Nirvana.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in the independent life of the soul after death?\" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that, as our bodies when they die become reabsorbed into\r\nthe bosom of nature, to become in part or whole reincarnated in other\r\nforms of life, so also our souls are reabsorbed into the great ocean\r\nof existence, to also dwell, in time, wholly or in part in some other\r\nform of life or love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE BANQUET ON THE AERIAL SHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe saloon, which was also the _salle a manger_, was situated in the\r\ncentre of the ship. Thus the entire travellers could assemble together\r\nwithout disturbing the centre of gravity of the structure.\r\n\r\nThe saloon was composed of woven cane, and ornamented with a dado of\r\nsage-green silk, on which were embroidered storks, pheasants and\r\neagles flying through space. An elongated table, also of wicker work,\r\ncontained a sumptuous repast.\r\n\r\nThe goddess congratulated the guests on their safety, which proved\r\nthat the skill that produced the _Aeropher_ had successfully grappled\r\nwith the difficult problem of aerial navigation.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the _Aeropher_ said it was the apex of mechanical\r\nskill. Invention had raised humanity from the depths of slavery,\r\nignorance, and weakness to a height of empire undreamed of in earlier\r\nages. Such material greatness expands the soul with godlike\r\nattributes. The ideal, inventive soul, the typical soul, was a god.\r\n\r\nThe poet said that the _Aeropher_ was the symbol of that kind of\r\npoetry in which energy and art were in equipoise. It glorified\r\nmechanical skill. It had been prophesied that as civilization advanced\r\npoetry would decline. There was a period in the history of Atvatabar\r\nin which matters of taste, imagination and intellectual emotion had\r\nbeen utterly neglected by a universal preference for scientific and\r\nmechanical pursuits. The country was overrun with reasoners, debaters,\r\nmetaphysicians, scientists and mechanical artists, but there were no\r\npoets. Such mechanical civilization was unfavorable to their\r\ndevelopment. The founding of such institutions as the art palace of\r\nGnaphisthasia and the spiritual palace of Egyplosis had grafted on\r\ntheir modern life the soul life of more ancient times, until\r\nsoul-worship had become the universal religion.\r\n\r\nThe goddess said that the aerial ship was the symbol of an ideal and\r\npassionate temperament resolved on discovering new spheres of\r\nspiritual beauty, so as to spiritualize the race. Such a soul ought to\r\nbe free to surround itself with that atmosphere from which it absorbs\r\nlife. It must choose its own weapons and armor, so as to be adequately\r\nequipped for the battle. In its eagerness to climb on discovering\r\nwings it must be accompanied by its own retinue of spirits, by\r\nenthusiastic and lasting friendships so consoling to its nature. Such\r\nwas the idea of Egyplosis.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lavornal at this point stated that when the company regained\r\nthe deck he would put the rotating wheel, placed at the stern of the\r\nship, in motion, so as to produce the combination of a revolving as\r\nwell as an onward flight.\r\n\r\n\"These wheels,\" said he, \"will spin us around, and by means of our\r\ndouble rudder we produce both vertical and lateral undulations, which,\r\ncombined with the rotary movement of the deck, will produce a\r\ndelirious sensation. All the abandon of great and strong birds are\r\nours. We can imitate the sonorous sweep of the seemorgh, who plunges\r\nwith supreme majesty in the abyss of air.\"\r\n\r\n\"These elaborations of flight,\" said Lyone, \"are not pursued merely\r\nfor physical pleasure, but in a mysterious way they are the moulders\r\nof the soul itself. That essence, re-enforced with such subtle and\r\npowerful enthusiasm, develops sensibility and assumes a grandeur and\r\necstasy unknown to those who merely travel on the earth. Each gesture\r\nof flight is a stride nearer omnipotence, an attribute more godlike by\r\nreason of its supremacy over those obstacles that crush and\r\noverwhelm.\"\r\n\r\nI shared the same seat with Lyone at the prow of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe scenery had in our absence developed into more marked grandeur.\r\nUnder the spell of an eternal morning, of such light as poets only\r\ndream of, there rose on either side of us consummate rocks and\r\ncataracts that signalled heaven. The swinging pillars of incredible\r\nstreams leaped thousands of feet into the gulf beneath. They charmed\r\nus like glittering serpents. The gorge, the rocks, the cataracts, the\r\nheavens of the earth above us were a prodigal feast to which nature\r\nhad bidden us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEN THE SHIP ROSE AGAIN TOWARD THE MAMMOTH ROCKS,\r\nADORNED WITH THE TAPESTRIES OF FALLING WAVE.]\r\n\r\nAs we explored the depths of the gulf the _Aeropher_ assumed an\r\nundulating motion. For several miles the vessel kept descending,\r\nuntil we swept through an overwhelming jungle of wild flowers. There\r\nwere acres of roses riotous in bloom, there was the trailing of wild\r\npeas sweet as honey, the blue of larkspurs, the fragrance of musk\r\nflowers, and the swaying cups of scarlet poppies.\r\n\r\nThen the ship rose again toward the mammoth rocks that shimmered in\r\nthe sunlight adorned with the tapestries of falling wave. Still upward\r\nwe rose into the spell-bound sky, feeding on the savage sweets of\r\nnature, the rhythm of the golden cliffs, the echoes of the waterfalls.\r\nWe were the associates of mighty pines that on the Theban peaks spread\r\nincomparable solaces for mind and heart. Then, as we descended from\r\nour extreme altitude, we began also to revolve with a splendid sweep\r\nof motion, until the landscape swam around us like a dream.\r\n\r\nIt was a delirious phantasy of airy clouds, fluttering leaves, songs\r\nof birds, milky avalanches, balsamic forests, and the awe-inspiring\r\nsilences of revolving walls!\r\n\r\nThe intoxication of such wheeling flight filled us with a strange joy.\r\nOur journey became wistful, eager, breathless. We became poets, and\r\nthe soul of a poet is a chameleon that takes its glow and color from\r\nthe surrounding infection. The motion that bore us in daring circles\r\nproduced a euthanasia of mind and an exaltation of soul. The jugglery\r\nof flight under such conditions produced a Nirvana of soul and a\r\nDharana of body. An exquisitely sweet whirlwind of emotion swept\r\nthrough I know not how many souls on the _Aeropher_, but certainly\r\nthrough the souls of Lyone and myself.\r\n\r\nWe both flew round and round like birds in intoxicating converse.\r\nDuring the progress of the flight, intellect, will and memory\r\nslumbered. I was deprived of the use of all external faculties, while\r\nthose of the soul were correspondingly increased. Imagination and\r\nemotion were excited with rapturous energy. Lyone's eyes sparkled with\r\na celestial joy. She was again the goddess in her ecstasy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nWE REACH EGYPLOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I recovered my every-day senses the revolving motion of the\r\n_Aeropher_ had ceased and our flight was confined to an undulating\r\nmovement. I was holding the hand of the goddess, who had been in a\r\nhyperaesthetic condition herself during the gyrations of the ship, and\r\nwhen feeling her senses leaving her she had involuntarily grasped my\r\nhand. Our souls had been the recipients of the same rapturous joy.\r\n\r\nWhen we were once more ourselves, Lyone was anxious to know something\r\nof the character of the women of the outer world. I talked to her\r\nabout such women as resembled herself in spiritual fervor.\r\n\r\nI described the Egyptian legend of Isis, the goddess of love, of life,\r\nof nature. I told her of St. Theresa, that blessed visionary, whose\r\nsoul frequently experienced those voluptuous sensations, such as might\r\nbe experienced when expiring in raptures on the bosom of God. I spoke\r\nalso of pearly Eve, to whom, ere she had eaten of the fatal fruit,\r\nevery moment was a delight, every blossom a wilderness of sweets. I\r\nspoke of Cleopatra, the haughty daughter of the Nile, the fervor of\r\nwhose passion thickened into lust and death.\r\n\r\nMy story was interrupted by the arrival of the captain, who said:\r\n\"Your holiness, we will reach Egyplosis in an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"So soon,\" murmured the goddess.\r\n\r\n\"Is it the pleasure of your holiness that we alight at the private\r\nsanctuary or at the grand gate?\" inquired the captain.\r\n\r\n\"At the grand gate, of course,\" said the goddess; \"we must give our\r\nfriends a royal welcome.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain bowed in obedience and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe charms of our journey grew more and more interesting. In addition\r\nto the delights of discovery, I felt the rising ambition of a great\r\njoy in connection with Lyone. It was a daring thought, that I might\r\npossibly partake of a glorious _camaraderie_ with the goddess, but\r\nwhen I thought that no stranger could possibly share a heart that\r\nbelonged only to her own people, only to Atvatabar, I felt that Lyone\r\nwas very far off indeed.\r\n\r\nIn a land where spiritual love was the prerogative of the priestly\r\ncaste, strictly limited to the members of that caste, any priestly\r\ncondescension or favor given to those outside the pale of the\r\npriesthood could have no meaning and was forbidden under penalty of\r\ndeath. Of course human nature is liable to err always, and it came to\r\npass that the records of the legal tribunals of Atvatabar proved that\r\nmany departures in soul fellowship took place between the most loyal\r\ninmates of Egyplosis and the outer inhabitants. The punishment for\r\nsuch offence to the most sacred law of Atvatabar, although terrible,\r\nwas powerless to prevent such _mesalliances_ of souls.\r\n\r\nI knew that a spark of what might prove a mighty conflagration was\r\nalready kindled in the bosom of the goddess. It thrilled me to know\r\nit, but only as the laws and customs of this strange country became\r\nknown to me did I realize the tremendous risk in Lyone allowing her\r\nheart to betray any kinship, however remote, with mine. The greater\r\nthe dignity, the greater the offence. The crime was sacrilege, and the\r\npunishment was death by the magnic fluid.\r\n\r\nThe goddess already belonged to her faith. She was love's\r\n_religieuse_. It was a cruel thing to seek her love when I knew it\r\nwould perhaps bring her to an untimely end and stamp her name with\r\neverlasting disgrace. On the other hand, if the goddess, knowing much\r\nbetter than I the result of loving one not only outside of the sacred\r\ncaste, but an \"outer barbarian\" as well, was brave enough to incur\r\neven the risk of death on behalf of her love, would I be so cowardly\r\nas not to follow her supreme soul even to martyrdom itself? And it\r\nmight be that we might even raise a following large enough to defeat\r\nour enemies, and end in a greater triumph than either of us ever yet\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts that filled me when the aerial ship suddenly\r\nshot out of the chasm in which we had so long travelled and emerged\r\nupon the wide circular basin of the mountains about one hundred miles\r\nin diameter. In the centre of the high valley lay an immense lake, in\r\nwhose centre stood a large island, everywhere visible from the shores,\r\nwhereon stood the sacred palace of Egyplosis, the many-templed college\r\nof souls. We saw its pale green, gleaming walls rising from a tropical\r\nforest of dark green trees. Its gold and crystal domes reflected the\r\nsunlight dazzlingly, making the palace plainly visible all over that\r\nwide valley.\r\n\r\nEgyplosis was a little city composed of an immense quadrangle, the\r\nsupernal palace together with the subterranean infernal palace. The\r\nsupernal palace was of enormous dimensions, being a square mile in\r\nextent, and was composed of over a hundred temples and palaces rising\r\nhigh in the air, the chief seat of soul worship in Atvatabar, and the\r\nhome of twice ten thousand priests and priestesses.\r\n\r\nThe infernal palace consisted of one hundred subterranean temples and\r\nlabyrinths, all sculptured, like the supernal palace, out of the\r\nliving rock, and situated directly underneath it.\r\n\r\nOur course lay in a direct line across the noble valley. It was the\r\nmost diversified part of the country we had yet crossed, being broken\r\nup into hills and valleys, glens and precipices, fields and forests,\r\nlakes, islands and gardens, all composing a region of bewildering\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe emotions awakened by my near approach to this strange place were\r\nkeen and exciting. Now for the first time in history its mystery was\r\nabout to be disclosed to alien eyes from the outer world.\r\n\r\nSoon after entering the park we saw, some fifty miles to the north,\r\nthe ship containing the sailors rapidly approaching Egyplosis. It had\r\nalso escaped destruction by the cyclone, having doubtless followed us\r\ndown the canyon we sought refuge in.\r\n\r\nIt was a new sensation to float bird-like over the enchanted fields in\r\nthis most mysterious of worlds, toward a spot that has no prototype on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nA multitude of domes and crenelated walls grew into immense\r\nproportions beneath the boundless light. Egyplosis possessed in its\r\npalaces the enchanted calm of Hindoo and Greek architecture, together\r\nwith the thrilling ecstasy of Gothic shrines. Blended with these\r\nprecious qualities there was a poetic generalization of the mighty\r\nactivities of modern civilization. It was the home of spiritual and\r\nphysical empire.\r\n\r\nI wondered greatly what Eleusinian mysteries its courts contained. I\r\nwas indeed another Hercules visiting the realms of Pluto and the\r\ngarden of Proserpine in quest of the immortal fruits of knowledge.\r\nWould I be successful in my quest, and bear back to the outer world\r\nsome magical secret its nations would be glad to know?\r\n\r\nFinally, we saw the clear and marvellous palace close at hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYONE WAS BORNE ON A LITTER FROM THE AERIAL SHIP TO THE\r\nPALACE.]\r\n\r\nA hundred banners floated from its walls, and music from an army of\r\nneophytes on its towers saluted us.\r\n\r\nThe _Aeropher_ swept over the lake, and, reaching the island, alighted\r\non a marble causeway leading to the grand entrance of the palace. A\r\nthousand wayleals stood ranged on either side as a guard of honor. We\r\nhad left the forest that largely covers the island, and on either hand\r\nstretched gardens of rainbow-colored flowers, and here and there\r\nfountains sparkled in the sunny air.\r\n\r\nLyone seemed the impersonation of divine loveliness as she was borne\r\nin a litter from the aerial ship to the palace. On her head sparkled\r\nthe bird of yearning, typical of hopeless love.\r\n\r\nThe high priest Hushnoly and the priestess Zooly-Soase of the supernal\r\npalace and the grand sorcerer Charka and the grand sorceress Thoubool\r\nof the infernal palace, surrounded by the chief priests and\r\npriestesses, magicians, sorcerers, wizards, theosophists,\r\nspiritualists, etc., gave us a royal welcome, and were jubilant at the\r\nreturn of the supreme goddess to Egyplosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND TEMPLE OF HARIKAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve of the most handsome priests and priestesses constituted the\r\nguard of twin-souls in waiting to the goddess, and these escorted her\r\ninto the grand court of the temple palace. Over a gigantic archway\r\nwere sculptured the words \"Dya Pateis omt Ami Cair,\" which meant \"Two\r\nBodies and One Soul.\" This was the motto of Egyplosis, the expression\r\nof ideal friendship and indicative of a system of life the reverse of\r\nthat of the outer world of Atvatabar, which had for its motto, \"One\r\nBody and Two Souls.\"\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the supernal palace was of amazing proportions and\r\nsolid grandeur. Its aggregation of temples was sculptured out of one\r\nmighty block of pale green marble. The vast quadrangle seemed a\r\ntempest of imagination and art, whose temples, terraces and towers\r\nwere the expression of the infinite souls that formed them. The color\r\nof the stone was beautifully relieved by broad bands of the vermilion\r\nmetal terrelium, that plated the walls with several parallel friezes,\r\nwhich lent an amazing splendor to the scene, and made us feel as\r\nthough we were entering some palace of eternity, where magnificence\r\nhas no end.\r\n\r\nWe had no time to examine the marvels spread before our delighted\r\neyes, for, on the conclusion of our reception by the great officers of\r\nthe palace, we were conducted to chambers set apart for our use, to\r\nrest and refresh ourselves to witness the exercises attending the\r\ninstallation of a twin-soul on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe chief temple at Egyplosis was interiorly of semi-circular shape,\r\nlike a Greek theatre, five hundred feet in width. It was covered like\r\nthe pantheon with a sculptured roof and dome of many-colored glass.\r\nThe roof was one hundred and thirty feet above the lowest tier of\r\nseats beneath or one hundred feet above the level of the highest seats\r\nbeneath. The walls were laboriously sculptured dado and field and\r\nfrieze, with bas-reliefs of the same character as the golden throne of\r\nthe gods that stood at the centre of the semi-circle.\r\n\r\nThe dado was thirty-two feet in height, on which were carved the\r\nemblems of every possible machine, implement or invention that\r\nconferred supremacy over nature in idealized grandeur. Battles of\r\nflying wayleals and races of bockhockids were carved in grand\r\nconfusion. It was a splendid reunion of science and art.\r\n\r\nHigher up the field space, which was fifty feet in height, was broken\r\nby a gallery or cloister behind a tier of splendid pillars, themselves\r\ncarved with the emblems of art. The hidden wall, as well as those\r\nportions above and below the cloister between dado and frieze, were\r\ncovered with endless representations of the creations of art. Heroic\r\neurythmic figures representing poetry, music, painting, architecture,\r\netc., formed a mighty symposium.\r\n\r\nHighest of all, the enormous frieze, fully sixteen feet in width, was\r\none mighty band of solid terrelium. This had been cast in plates\r\nhaving sculptured symbols in high relief of the sublime emblems of\r\nHarikar, and portrayed scenes from the idealities and mysteries of\r\nEgyplosis.\r\n\r\nThere were represented the fine and perfect figures of magicians in\r\nthe midst of their incantations, of sorcerers raising souls to life\r\nagain; there were visions of the sorcery of love in all its moods, and\r\nof the rapt practices of twin-souls generating a creative force in\r\nbatteries of spirit power.\r\n\r\nAbove all rose the dome whose lights were fadeless. The pavement of\r\nthe temple had been chiselled in the form of a longitudinal hollow\r\nbasin, containing a series of wide terraces of polished stone, whereon\r\nwere placed divans of the richest upholstery. In each divan sat a\r\nwinged twin-soul, priest and priestess, the devotees of hopeless love.\r\nOn the throne itself sat Lyone, the supreme goddess, in the semi-nude\r\nsplendor of the pantheon, arranged with tiara and jewelled belt and\r\nflowing skirt of sea-green aquelium lace. She made a picture divinely\r\nentrancing and noble. Supporting the throne was an immense pedestal of\r\npolished marble, fully one hundred feet in diameter and twenty feet in\r\nheight, which stood upon a wide and elevated pavement of solid silver,\r\nwhereon the priests and priestesses officiated in the services to the\r\ngoddess. On crimson couches sat their majesties the king and queen of\r\nAtvatabar, together with the great officers of the realm. Next to the\r\nroyal group myself and the officers and seamen of the _Polar King_\r\noccupied seats of honor. Behind, around and above us, filling the\r\nimmense temple, rose the concave mass of twin-souls numbering ten\r\nthousand individuals, each seated with counterpart soul.\r\n\r\nAs I gazed on those happy terraces of life, youth, love and beauty, I\r\nfelt exhilarated with the sensations the scene gave rise to.\r\n\r\nThe garments of both priests and priestesses were fashioned in a style\r\nsomewhat resembling the decorative dresses seen on Greek and Japanese\r\nvases, yet wholly original in design. In many cases the priestesses\r\nwere swathed in transparent tissues that revealed figures like pale\r\nolive gold within.\r\n\r\nThe grand sorcerer Charka and the grand sorceress Thoubool occupied a\r\nconspicuous divan upholstered with cloth of gold. The sorceress was a\r\ngrand beauty, neither blond nor brunette, but her complexion would,\r\nchameleon-like, change from a rosy white to a clear golden hue. Her\r\nhair was bright copper, gleaming like strands of metal. Her eyes\r\nchanged color incessantly, being successively blue and black.\r\n\r\nHer robe was a pale green silk, bound at the waist with a heavy\r\ncincture of gold. She wore a necklace of many-colored gems.\r\n\r\nThe grand sorcerer wore a robe of moss-green velvet embroidered with\r\nappliqued white silk lace, resembling lotus bloom. Both wore diadems\r\nof emeralds. Other twin-souls were arrayed in equally splendid attire,\r\nand seated on couches whose upholstery accentuated or harmonized with\r\ntheir fair occupants. Whatever the color selected, I observed that\r\neach twin-soul priest and priestess wore robes of a consanguineous\r\nhue, however the individual stuffs might vary in texture or quality. I\r\nalso observed that in no case were the laws of taste in color\r\nviolated, and unerring instinct had guided every priest and priestess\r\nin achieving the most piquant harmonies of color. With garments in\r\nsimultaneous contrast each twin-soul sat on a couch upholstered in\r\nfabrics in pure contrast of color.\r\n\r\nHow I wished some great painter of the outer world could transfer to\r\ncanvas that conflagration of beauty.\r\n\r\nSeveral twin-souls, with garments that seemed beaten gold, reclined on\r\nblack velvet couches beside us. On an immense divan of white velvet\r\nnear by sat a group of priests and priestesses arrayed in stuffs that\r\nwere the strangest tones of purple, brown, violet, green, and red. A\r\ntwin-soul in golden maize sat on a dark purple couch. A twin-soul in\r\necru sat on a salmon-colored couch, while a twin-soul in myosotis blue\r\nreposed on a couch of the color of Australian gold. Celibates and\r\nvestals in russet robes luxuriated on couches of magnolia green.\r\n\r\nIt was evident their artists possessed a happy skill in creating such\r\nharmonies of costume. Sculptor, upholsterer and _couturiere_ formed\r\nthe trinity of genius that wrought marvels of form and color.\r\n\r\nHarikar, the Holy Soul, was the deity, who was symbolized by the\r\ngoddess, and ministered to by such a retinue of souls. No doubt\r\nHarikar was mightily pleased at such a tribute of wealth, love and\r\nbeauty. As far as an individual could appreciate such splendor, I must\r\ntestify it was an eminently thrilling oblation.\r\n\r\nThe votaries themselves were no solitary ascetics who practised heroic\r\nmortifications to obtain dominion over life or nature. Instead of the\r\npale devotee who in other creed cultivates the desire to get away from\r\nall things earthly, and whose every effort is to extinguish pleasure\r\nin life, every theopath of Harikar cultivated a Greek perfection of\r\nbody, as well as a Gothic intensity of soul. By what powerful\r\nincantation were the priests of Egyplosis able to overcome the law of\r\nthe outer world, that all joy must be paid for in pain, and that the\r\njoy was nearly always too dear at the price given?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE INSTALLATION OF A TWIN-SOUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sacred musicians of the temple surrounded the throne in solid\r\ncircles each arrayed in lordly attire.\r\n\r\nThey flourished instruments of gold, that rang out music of such depth\r\nand clearness of tone as to melt every soul in that vast audience into\r\none thrilling whole. The sounding song was the incarnation of all\r\nthings majestic and glorious. In its breathless measures were born the\r\nspirits of conquest, pride, inspiration, love and sympathy. The\r\nthrilling climax was wrought of passages eloquent of love, tenderness,\r\nreverence, joy, adoration and poetry.\r\n\r\nAgain, with the music becoming more refined, a choir of singers in the\r\nhigh cloister in the walls sang as they walked a refrain of purifying\r\nsweetness. It was a wail of fidelity and love, and both song and music\r\nmoved in perfect accord.\r\n\r\nThereafter music alone was heard, when the high priest Hushnoly, and\r\nthe high priestess Zooly-Soase stood before us on the silver pavement\r\nbeneath the throne.\r\n\r\nThe blue-black hair of the high priestess fell around her olive face\r\nand shoulders like a cloud of darkness. She wore a robe of coral-red\r\nsilken gossamer, that with its foldings shivered like quicksilver,\r\nrevealing a figure of olive marble beneath. Her shoulders, arms and\r\nbreasts, soft and heavy in mould, were dimly seen beneath their coral\r\nveil. Her profile was perfect. Her eyes were jewels of swart fire. Her\r\neyebrows made perfect arches above them, enhancing the beauty of her\r\nface. Her mouth was fine and tender, and her lips red with kisses. The\r\nhigh priest, whose noble features were olive-green in hue, wore a\r\nsplendid opaque silk burnous of camellia-red, of heavier texture than\r\nthat of the priestess. He wore boots of scarlet lacquered leather.\r\nBoth wore diadems of kragon, the precious stone.\r\n\r\nA stone altar curiously carved, on which stood a green bronze turtle\r\nof large size, occupied one side of the front of the pavement. The\r\nturtle held its head stretched upward, and through its open mouth a\r\nthin stream of blue smoke ascended. On the wide flat back of the\r\nturtle lay an open volume, the sacred book of Egyplosis.\r\n\r\nThe priest and priestess stood beside the altar, each reading an\r\nalternate stanza from the ritual of the goddess. While reading, the\r\npriests with loud voice followed the intoning of the high priest, and\r\nthe priestesses that of the high priestess, as follows:\r\n\r\n               THE RITUAL OF HOPELESS LOVE.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     Harikar is the supreme soul, and the goddess Lyone his\r\n     supreme incarnation. Equally free from asceticism and\r\n     indulgence, she treads the golden path.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Let us joyfully obey our adorable goddess, who commands us\r\n     in all manner of spiritual joys; let us follow her glorious\r\n     example, preserving purity of heart and life.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     Let us adore a cupid agonized, worshipping the goddess of\r\n     hopeless, tender, romantic love. Let us, with our\r\n     counterparts, the most lovely of maidens, become twin-souls\r\n     for evermore.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Let us love the shapely and active youths, the young men of\r\n     soul and intellect, likewise those of courage and daring,\r\n     whose hearts and minds are in complete unity.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     Let us add splendor of body to greatness of soul. May we\r\n     excel in the chase, the dance and the race. Let us drink\r\n     ambrosial wine, and eat the juiciest of meats, and clothe\r\n     ourselves with the finest and strongest of tissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRIEST AND PRIESTESS STOOD BESIDE THE ALTAR, EACH\r\nREADING AN ALTERNATE STANZA FROM THE RITUAL OF THE GODDESS.]\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Let us have a beautiful companionship with our counterpart\r\n     souls. Let us rejoice in the sun, in the free winds of the\r\n     sky, in the glory of flowers, in the pride of horses and\r\n     elephants richly caparisoned. Let us treasure jewels. Let us\r\n     possess emeralds, turquoises, diamonds and rubies. Let us\r\n     array ourselves with marvellous stuffs, dyed with the\r\n     richest colorings.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     Let us here in search of the ideal find an ever-increasing\r\n     Nirvana of blessedness. Goddess of souls, lead us to imagine\r\n     higher and holier exaltations; keener and more blessed\r\n     raptures!\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Sweet mother of souls! teach us to cultivate consoling\r\n     friendships with sympathetic hearts. Give us longings for\r\n     the utmost depths of love and tenderness; let us possess\r\n     fervid and impassioned souls.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     Let us create a paradise wherein life is one long\r\n     intoxication of love, beauty and soul-culture, found in the\r\n     fascinating converse of soul with soul and intellect with\r\n     intellect.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     May rapturous energies spring from hopeless loves! May the\r\n     yearning for inaccessible pleasures fill us with blessed\r\n     extravagance and holy madness.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     May we, firmly poised on virtue, become possessed of noble,\r\n     delicate, enormous souls. May the meeting of spirit with\r\n     spirit be too ecstatic for words to express. May vows be\r\n     written in each other's hearts. May the jewelled ring bind\r\n     soul and soul, and in the commingled life may the holy\r\n     compact be known, that a perfect circle of souls has been\r\n     consummated.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Secure by our compact and our vows from tasting of the\r\n     forbidden fruit, may we always possess the happy\r\n     intemperance of never-satiated souls.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     May the sorcery of love procure for us the shuddering\r\n     sensibility of sorrow, without its agony, as we possess the\r\n     perfect delight of day without the cold and lugubrious\r\n     shadows of the night.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Contact with life begets love, and love begets sensation,\r\n     and sensation desire, but reason and culture control desire\r\n     and so preserve the endless sweetness of our joy.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     The real mortal, the ideal divine. The real awakens desire,\r\n     the ideal feeds it. The real is the maimed, the halt and the\r\n     blind; it is the sepulchre of faith; the poor, the tawdry,\r\n     the miserable, it is the measure of our imperfect attainment\r\n     of the ideal.\r\n\r\n     The ideal is the supreme made possible by love and charity.\r\n     It is wide as imagination, perfect as love, calm as death.\r\n     It is the unchangeable and the immortal.\r\n\r\n     The real with its disappointments is soul shattering, but\r\n     the ideal is perennial life.\r\n\r\n     The more inaccessible the pleasure, the keener the delight\r\n     in its pursuit.\r\n\r\n     In love, accessibility is death.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     By losing the real we obtain the ideal. What others strive\r\n     for we possess. Praise to Harikar for the most glorious of\r\n     men, for precious viands, odoriferous wines, rare and costly\r\n     jewels, marvellous stuffs, and the hundred temples and\r\n     gardens of Egyplosis! Praise to Harikar for our counterpart\r\n     souls!\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n     Praise to Harikar for the loveliest of women, noble,\r\n     cultured and tender, with whom Nirvana is ecstasy.\r\n\r\n                         PRIESTESSES.\r\n\r\n     Nirvana is the consummate gift of Harikar, the one\r\n     everlasting sweetness!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the intonation of the ritual, the twin-souls put into practice\r\nthe manifestations of those endearments prayed for, and which they\r\ncertainly seemed to possess.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire congregation, priest and priestess, enfolded in\r\neach other's arms, swayed caressingly together and rapturously kissed\r\neach other. The fondest sighs were heard amid the recitations, and the\r\nfaces of lover and beloved were flushed the color of rosy flame. A\r\ntempest of restrained passion shook the entire congregation.\r\n\r\nWhat wonder, that, ruled by such a faith, each twin-soul splendidly\r\napparelled, in such an edifice, should grow rich and strange, bold and\r\ndelicate, and exhibit the intemperance of emotion excited by\r\nsensations so multiplied and extreme? I then saw a new meaning in the\r\ngrandeur and efflorescence of the sculptures of the temple. I saw in\r\nthe profuse decorations, in the arabesques so fantastically entangled\r\nand unrolled, a manifestation of the delicate sensibility that created\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNot only were real or natural objects idealized in art, but also\r\nconventional art, or the record of what nature suggests, as well as\r\nhow she appears, to the soul of the artist. And what must have been\r\nthe infinite wealth of suggestion to such souls as these to account\r\nfor such mouldings and traceries on wall and roof, and such wealth of\r\ncolor in attire, reflected and duplicated in the jewelled windows of\r\nthe dome. Here were souls fitted by nature and art to fuse and create\r\nthe suggestions of nature into shapes of eternal beauty. These\r\nflamboyant shapes and mystical colors presuppose the strange\r\nilluminations that had pierced tender and extravagant hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE INSTALLATION OF A TWIN-SOUL (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile priest and priestess were folded with mutual emotion two of the\r\nloveliest souls took the place of the high priest and priestess on the\r\nsilver pavement. The girl was young and tender, golden white in\r\ncomplexion with crimson lips. Her figure was swathed in a vermilion\r\nrobe, on the breast of which was embroidered in outline a sea-green\r\nsun whose swaying rays reached the furthest parts of her garment. Her\r\npale blue hair was crowned with a chaplet of daffodils. The youth wore\r\na robe of scarlet silk embroidered with a golden sun similar in design\r\nto that of the priestess. His pose was singularly noble. These two\r\nsouls were about to become priest and priestess, and, after having\r\ntaken the vows of hopeless love in presence of the goddess, high\r\npriest and priestess and congregation of twin-souls, they sang the\r\nfollowing anthem, accompanied by a wailing storm of music from several\r\nhundred violins, entitled:\r\n\r\n                  THE TWIN-SOUL.\r\n\r\n                     PRIEST.\r\n\r\n    Love is a heated furnace that devours\r\n    The thickest ice; love is a sweet moist wind\r\n    That cools the fevered desert with its balm.\r\n    There is no rain nor heat, yea, even snow\r\n    Is warm and rosy to ideal souls\r\n    That shudder in life's sweetest ecstasies.\r\n    If love, that makes ideal life, that dwells\r\n    In fragrant silences, makes green the grass,\r\n    And far more tender the diviner flowers,\r\n    It surely makes both bold and delicate\r\n    The warm superiority of flesh\r\n    Of that strange, sacred soul that dwells with mine.\r\n\r\n    The clear, yet golden whiteness of the form\r\n    That shines through pale green diaphane,\r\n    Showing its pliant beauty, is the dress\r\n    Of that rapt soul that is all tenderness.\r\n    Her brow is crowned with wistful daffodils,\r\n    Making her fair face fairer, and her eyes\r\n    Are clouded sapphires; yea, her perfect lips\r\n    (Whereon my soul will dwell for evermore)\r\n    Clear blood-red rubies! The sweet hand holds\r\n    Red poppies and blue lotus, and the soft\r\n    And sulphur blossomed wind flower. If such dress\r\n    Enshrine a soul as perfect, if the curves\r\n    That make her form voluptuous describe\r\n    The splendor of her soul (and this I know),\r\n    Love has no purer temple, nor more sweet!\r\n\r\nThe priest had sung alone so far, and now both priest and priestess\r\njoined their voices in a marvellous song. Wilder, sweeter and more\r\nintense, the violins stormed and wailed pathetic whirlwinds of\r\necstasy. At times their insufferable moans caught the excited hearts\r\nof the audience, and twin-souls in their passion would rise on their\r\nwings and, revolving, sweep around the amphitheatre locked in each\r\nother's arms.\r\n\r\n                PRIEST AND PRIESTESS.\r\n\r\n    Sharper than pain, we love, and the caress,\r\n    Keener than torment, overmaddens us!\r\n    There is no fasting when our feverish lips\r\n    Meet in the shock that strikes the spirit dumb\r\n    With swooning raptures! The dilated soul,\r\n    Intemperate with the enormous moan\r\n    Of passion, would outleap the strenuous will.\r\n    The flesh, transfigured with the crisis, reels,\r\n    Stretches the chain of duty and would leap\r\n    To grasp the tempting and forbidden fruit,\r\n    Were not that virtue is our comrade now.\r\n\r\n    We lift our eager faces to the sun\r\n    And feast on life and in each other's souls\r\n    Luxuriate, confounded with delight.\r\n    For us no mouldy cloister waits its prey,\r\n    Nor cave of darkness, where existence mourns\r\n    And dies beneath its scourgings. We have made\r\n    Our grim novitiate with reality.\r\n    Have known its agony, for we were born\r\n    So eminent for rapture, that the pain\r\n    All men inherit desolated us\r\n    And spread a living terror in our souls;\r\n    So that through clouds of everlasting woe\r\n    Scarce came the gleam of gladness or of love,\r\n    And earth was pitiless, and brutal souls\r\n    Who cannot feel there ruled. Oh, the wide world,\r\n    Degraded by ignoble brutishness,\r\n    Could yield no tendernesses infinite\r\n    For we who feed on rapture. Thus it was\r\n    Our souls on meeting, in the thrilling kiss\r\n    Were fused in indissoluble embrace;\r\n    We who were famished, in ideal love\r\n    Found sustenance and passed from death to life!\r\n\r\nThe song was perfect. The strange, fresh accents of the singers, so\r\nfull of love and passion, melted every heart in the temple with their\r\necstasy. One might hear such measures without thought of lapse of time\r\nor of worldly concerns. Ah! if one could hear such melody\r\nforevermore!\r\n\r\nWith a burst of dramatic joy the singing of the last stanza revealed\r\nwhole worlds of rapture.\r\n\r\n    Reincarnated in an earthly heaven,\r\n    Now have we reached Nirvana, now\r\n    Above us open the wide gulfs of joy,\r\n    And luminous and glorious round us blow\r\n    Millions of flowers; while afar there shines\r\n    The mighty splendor of the exhaustless sea!\r\n    We dwell in breathless joys, thrilled through and through\r\n    With majesty and sweetness; we have grown\r\n    Athletes of joy in our Agapemone:\r\n    Eager and breathless, we have found at last\r\n    The fount of youth, the magical Arjeels;\r\n    Fruits of organic gold amid the leaves\r\n    Sparkle, and around our island home\r\n    Are spread the veritable golden sands\r\n    Whereon our happy feet tread evermore!\r\n\r\nThe singers disappeared, and in their places a hundred\r\nwondrously-arrayed figures moved in the dance of pure being on the\r\nsilver pavement. Lithe as leopards, with unclad limbs and feet, priest\r\nand priestess danced all the ecstasies of Egyplosis. The dancers were\r\nso young, so fresh, so tender, so beautiful, and so innocent, that it\r\nwas a supreme joy to behold them. Rapture grew universal and lovers\r\ncried with hysterical shudderings. The rainbow-colored throng, moving\r\nto the music of the golden instruments, flashed upon the pavement like\r\njoy taking possession of the world!\r\n\r\nI felt intensely sad for Lyone, who sat like a statue of golden\r\nmarble, gazing on the abyss of joy beneath. Had the goddess no lover\r\nto press her to his heart amid the universal rapture? Alas! the\r\nimmense dignity of her position and the unalterable laws of Atvatabar\r\nalike prevented any single soul from feeding the intense hunger that\r\nconsumed her.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the dancers, the unseen choir in the cloisters began to\r\nsing a new opera of love, and the strains of an \"Ave, Lyone, bona\r\ndea,\" stole upon the senses like the bewildering sighs of angels,\r\nmaking one ache with delight. A story of romantic love once more\r\nsculptured the faces of priest and priestess with angelic beauty, as\r\nit rose on wings of song and swept in delightful moans upon the carven\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nIt was a memorable scene, one never to be forgotten! The hieroglyphic\r\nwalls, carved in high relief with the instruments of empire, the dome\r\nwith its ten thousand fadeless lights, the terraces of twin-souls\r\nradiant with delight, the marvellous dancers, the superb music that\r\nseemed to shake the heart of the solid stone that enclosed us, and\r\nhigh over all the supreme goddess in whose honor all this adoration\r\nwas made, seated in bliss on the throne of the gods--such was the\r\nsituation at that moment.\r\n\r\nIt was a monstrous and a splendid joy!\r\n\r\nSuddenly a roar of invincible music issued from gigantic tubes that\r\npierced the body of the throne itself with fresh and warlike\r\nexplosions of melody. I was filled with a maddening delight, until\r\nconsciousness could hardly bear the strain any longer. I cried aloud,\r\namid a Chimborazo of song, a hundred-cratered Popocatapetl of sweet\r\nstrains. The audience, enraptured with the climax, became an inferno\r\nof passion, laughter tears and felicity!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY OF EGYPLOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palace of the goddess at Egyplosis was a component part of the\r\nvast quadrangle known as the supernal palace. The view therefrom\r\nembraced the wide inner garden of the entire palace of temples,\r\ndiscovering jungles of shrubs and flowers of all imaginable hues,\r\ninterspersed with lakes sleeping in their marble basins like enormous\r\njewels. Fountains of solid silver gushed forth a brilliant foam of\r\nwaters amid the embowering foliage, and there glad priests, in the\r\nsociety of priestesses sweeter than the flowers themselves, dreamed\r\nlife away in enthusiastic peace. Surrounding all was the high and\r\nglorious palace, forming a background, on the design of which\r\nimagination and art had been entirely exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe scene the day following the Ritual of the installation of a\r\ntwin-soul in the temple of Egyplosis was a boudoir in the palace of\r\nthe goddess. It was a large apartment, whose walls were hung with\r\npanels of rose-colored velvet, embroidered with gray-green silk\r\nfoliage. In one large tapestry, the hands of loving priestesses had\r\nembroidered a scene in the garden of Egyplosis. On a dais, upon a\r\ncouch of soft red silk upholstery sat Lyone, swathed in draperies of\r\nshrimp pink and pale peacock green, embroidered with ivory-white silk.\r\nA large terra-cotta silk rug, whose only ornament was an elaborate\r\nborder, covered the floor. The goddess wore a belt of aquelium\r\nserpents having tulips in their mouths. Heavy terrelium bracelets\r\nadorned her wrists, and she wore a diminutive tiara on her head.\r\n\r\nI sat on a luxurious seat, the sole guest of the goddess. I was\r\nrapidly learning from the divinity the mystery of Egyplosis. I was\r\nespecially anxious to find out how the jewel of one hundred years of\r\nyouth could be grafted into the ordinary existence. An idea so\r\nsplendid seemed to be the germ of earthly immortality. We were\r\ndiscussing the subject of hopeless love, and I asked her if she\r\nconsidered life and love were the same element.\r\n\r\n\"Life and love are synonymous,\" she replied. \"By love I mean the\r\nspiritual, ideal, romantic passion that is hopeless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"but does not the idea of inaccessibility create a\r\nworthless desire, that is, a desire for something that is forbidden or\r\nunattainable? The majority of men, I think, will prefer an every-day\r\nlove with all its risks and imperfections to the shadowy ghost of a\r\nhopeless love. The hopeful love does no violence to nature such as is\r\ncontemplated by the hopeless sentiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hardly understand me,\" said she; \"the pleasure we aspire to is\r\nsuperior to any physical delight, and is an end in itself. It is\r\nromantic love, that blooms like a single flower in the crevices of a\r\nvolcano. It is the quintessence of existence, the rarest wine of life,\r\nthe expressed sweetness of difficulty and repression and\r\nlong-suffering, the choicest holiday of the soul. We are willing to\r\npay the price of hopelessness to taste such nectar. In the every-day\r\nworld such joy only rarely exists. Interest, indulgence, ambition,\r\nfortune, time, temper and marriage destroy it. Youth, captivated by a\r\nbeautiful face or a winning smile, thinks it has discovered its true\r\ncounterpart, and so takes possession of the prize. It finds afterward\r\nit was mistaken, and all its life thenceforth becomes miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I replied, \"if the world at large had discovered that your\r\ntheory of love was the true one, it would long since have acted on\r\nits discovery and put no destroying restraint or obligation on so\r\nprecious a possession. But the world found that a thousand accidents\r\nwould infallibly open the eyes of both parties to the fact that they\r\npossessed but few qualities in common, or in counterpart, and with\r\nsuch knowledge of good and evil they would infallibly separate. Hence\r\nthe foundation of society would be torn asunder and the rising\r\ngeneration of helpless children become orphaned of home, the very\r\nbulwark of life. Society must have assurances that people do not get\r\nmarried simply as an experiment, but are willing to honorably\r\nundertake the mutual sacrifices their act carries with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already admitted,\" said she, \"that the joy of spiritual love\r\nhardly ever exists in its virgin force in the every-day world. I admit\r\nthat the necessary regulations of society, although they tend to\r\ndestroy it, must be enforced. The Atvatabar nation rests on the\r\nmarriage idea. At one time in our history the people strove for ideal\r\nlove and overthrew the ordinary marriage yoke without the restraint of\r\nreason. Law and order disappeared and social chaos reigned. The land\r\nwas filled with the wailings of orphans whose parents had deserted\r\nthem, and men and women formed new associates every day. Unbridled\r\nlicense devastated the country. Our lawgivers re-established the law\r\nof marriage as being the only law suitable to mankind. Man in the\r\naggregate had not developed to a state in which the consummation of\r\nmarriage could be dispensed with. Yet there were many among those who\r\nhad advocated ideal love worthy of their theory. Although married to\r\neach other, they had remained celibates. For these Egyplosis was\r\nfounded, for the study and practice of what is really a higher\r\ndevelopment of human nature and in itself an unquestionable good. It\r\nis the most powerful element in the production of creative energy of\r\nsoul and personal beauty. As you will have observed, all our devotees\r\nare singularly beautiful in form and feature and possess spirit power\r\nto a high degree.\"\r\n\r\nAs the goddess spoke a few threads of her bright blue hair had strayed\r\nacross her face. Her beautiful eyes flashed with a royalty of truth,\r\ntenderness, magnetism, and feeling. She was the living illustration of\r\nher claims for Egyplosis.\r\n\r\n\"What you say,\" I replied, \"illustrates that ordinary marriage, with\r\nall its limitations and, infelicities, is absolutely necessary for the\r\nwell-being of society. Marriage is simply the application of reason\r\nand morality to blind, passionate nature. The home circle is the\r\norigin of nationality, progress, and wealth. Ideal love, wrested from\r\nthe dragon of difficulty, is, I think, but rarely tasted in so real,\r\nso practical an institution. This is the experience of the nations of\r\nthe outer world, and how much better for man that it is so? A roadway\r\nin proportion to its rhythm of undulation becomes useless, hindering\r\ntravel rather than accelerating it. So also with love. When settled in\r\nthe calm security of marriage the mind is freed from the romantic\r\nextravagance, the torture, the delight of hopeless sentiment. Thus men\r\nare free to devote themselves to the more serious purposes of life and\r\nachieve wealth and fame for themselves and their families. I am,\r\nnevertheless, curious to see how your institution is conducted, for\r\nhopeless love seems to me one of the most disquieting things in life.\r\nIts victims, happy and unhappy, resisting passion with regret or\r\nyielding with remorse, are ever on the rack of torture. They resemble\r\nthe devotees of certain idols, who pierce themselves with cruel hooks\r\nand swing aloft in honor of their god. It may be pleasure, but not one\r\nin a thousand will ever achieve that degree of soul exaltation and\r\nphysical abnegation to think it so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet not one in a thousand, not one in a hundred thousand lives in\r\nEgyplosis,\" said the goddess.\r\n\r\n\"The men who achieve anything,\" I continued, \"good and great in the world,\r\nthe men who build empires, discover ideas, who both rule and populate\r\nnations, are all rewarded by a hopeful love. It is only a hopeless love\r\nthat sets up its mirage of false and never-to-be-obtained joys. Hence, I\r\nask you the question, What of Egyplosis?\"\r\n\r\nThe goddess smiled at my controversial attitude, \"It is the old\r\nquestion,\" she replied, \"of conventionalism _versus_ art, of economic\r\ninstitutions _versus_ nature and life. Just as we endeavor to rescue\r\nspontaneous invention and originality from the disease of the\r\ntasteless and laborious productions of a mechanical civilization, so\r\nwe labor to create an earthly home for the soul in a world where\r\nsuperficial necessities will stifle it out of existence. There was a\r\ntime in the history of Atvatabar when people talked of art and love,\r\nboth of which did not exist. The octopus of commercial, mechanical and\r\neconomical life had strangled the soul and all its attributes. Men\r\nfought for treaties of commerce, treaties of marriage, deeds of\r\nproperty, and all the while acted in defiance of their obligations.\r\nThey cheated each other, lied to each other, deserted each other\r\nincessantly. Love had taken wings and fled. Art had lost its language\r\nand its cunning. Life was no longer illuminated with splendid ideals.\r\nIt was no longer arrayed in the fair and fascinating garments that\r\nonly the soul can weave. History was no longer glorified by paintings\r\nand sculptured reliefs. Religion was no longer symbolized in the\r\nsolemn magnificence of architecture, or sculptured shrines of gods.\r\nArticles of daily use were made solely to make a profit, and the\r\nwidespread use of machinery was destroying the art, the soul, the pure\r\nlife of the people. A paternal government, seeing the tyranny of\r\ncommercialism and the possible extinction of the soul itself, has\r\nwisely, in the spirit of patriarchal hospitality, established the art\r\ninstitution of Gnaphisthasia and the religious institution of\r\nEgyplosis, for soul development in harmony with the high destiny of\r\nmankind. Harikar, or developed soul, is the natural sequence of the\r\ndevelopment of the soul and intellect, achieving the supreme virtue of\r\nspiritual perfection, or dominion of the passions of the body and the\r\nforces of nature. Love was the one great end of our religion, for life\r\nis love.\"\r\n\r\n\"I value your creed,\" I continued, \"to the fullest extent. I value the\r\nidea that every intellect shall enfold a soul. You practise the\r\ndoctrine that hopeless love is that phase of the passion that contains\r\nthe most delirious possibilities of joy, yet, allow me to ask, have\r\nyou never discovered that there may be disappointments for even such\r\nguarded emotions as yours? Are your neophytes perfectly happy? We\r\nfind, in the outer world at least, that no state or condition in life\r\nis perfectly pleasurable. Their joys die of their own _ennui_ if for\r\nno other cause. We find happiness like a flower; it has its period of\r\nbloom and decay. The more intoxicating the beauty the shorter its\r\nlife. Happiness long continued grows common, fades and dies. Then\r\nagain the human soul is always in a fever of unrest. It always thinks\r\nwhat is beyond its reach is liberty. As one of our poets has expressed\r\nit:\r\n\r\n                    \"'Oh, give me liberty!\r\n    For even were a paradise itself my prison,\r\n    Still would I long to leap the crystal walls!'\"\r\n\r\nAs I spoke I saw that the goddess was an eager listener to my words.\r\nWas it possible that she might have an idea that even Egyplosis might\r\nindeed be a prison? But, then, her position, her vows, recalled to her\r\nthe fact that she was love's _religieuse_, an indissoluble part of the\r\ntemple of love itself.\r\n\r\nThe goddess replied, that sometimes impatient spirits had entered the\r\npalace, but any incorrigible cases of insubordination were either\r\nimprisoned in the fortress beneath the palace or were expelled into\r\nthe outer world. The neophytes entered the temple college while under\r\ntwenty years of age. Each soul, thereafter mingling freely with five\r\nthousand of the opposite sex, chooses in a month its counterpart for\r\nlife, thus forming a complete circle. The choice must be approved by a\r\ncouncil of \"Soul Inquisitors\" who, before the lifelong union is made,\r\nsee that both possess all the elements that will produce a high, holy\r\nand pure blending of thought, feeling, emotion, joys spiritual and\r\nintellectual, whose every breath will be an ecstasy, and at the same\r\ntime possess reverence for each other and the power of resistance to\r\npassion and are able to walk in the pure path.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think,\" I replied, \"that the temptation being ever\r\npresent, the struggle in the soul must in time exhaust and enfeeble\r\nthe moral powers, producing disastrous consequences?\"\r\n\r\nBefore the goddess could reply, a terrible commotion was heard in the\r\npalace garden. The shrieks of a woman mingled with the loud voices of\r\nmen were heard in furious clamor, and one of the royal guards entered\r\nthe palace chamber in breathless haste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE SIN OF A TWIN-SOUL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your holiness,\" said the captain of the sacred guard, as he entered\r\nthe apartment, \"the twin-soul Ardsolus and Merga has sinned against\r\nthe laws and religion of Egyplosis. I crave permission to bring the\r\nguilty pair before the goddess with the evidence of their guilt.\"\r\n\r\nThe goddess, answering quickly, ordered the priest and priestess to be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe captain thereupon commanded his wayleals to bring the prisoners\r\ninto the audience chamber.\r\n\r\nShrinking between her guards, the priestess Merga appeared bearing in\r\nher arms a lovely babe, a rosy duplicate of herself. Following her\r\ncame the priest Ardsolus, also a prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe priestess was the picture of petite girlish beauty. Her delicate\r\nrose complexion was flushed with a feeling of shame, and her handsome\r\nhazel eyes, dilated with vexation and sorrow, were filled with tears.\r\n\r\nHer lover was tall, straight and athletic, with a proud, fine-cut\r\nface. The down of manhood was just showing itself on his upper lip.\r\n\r\n\"I feel sorry for you both,\" said the goddess; \"did you weary of the\r\njoys of Egyplosis?\"\r\n\r\nArdsolus threw back over his shoulder a falling fold of his white\r\nbournous and, drawing himself proudly up, replied: \"Yes, your\r\nholiness, our life here is imprisonment. We have grown weary of its\r\nrestraint and are eager to return to the outer world with all its\r\ncares and freedom.\"\r\n\r\nThe chamberlain at this moment announced the arrival of the high\r\npriest Hushnoly, the secular, as well as the sacred governor of\r\nEgyplosis, and the high priestess Zooly-Soase, who both entered the\r\npresence chamber. Hushnoly, saluting the goddess, announced that he\r\nhad come in search of the erring twin-soul. The high priest was\r\nastonished beyond expression at finding sin and shame in so glorious a\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nAddressing the weeping girl, he said: \"Do you know, my child, how\r\nunfortunate you have been? You have committed the unpardonable sin in\r\nthe temple of hopeless love. Did you not think of your lifelong vows\r\nof celibacy and of the deep and tender joy of romantic love?\"\r\n\r\nMerga only replied by clasping her babe still closer to her breast and\r\nbathing it with her tears.\r\n\r\n\"What excuse do you offer for your crime against yourself, your\r\nreligion and your fellow-priests?\" demanded the high, priest of\r\nArdsolus.\r\n\r\n\"Your highness,\" said the youth, \"we have, after due experience of our\r\nvows, arrived at the conclusion that such vows are a violation of\r\nnature. Everything here bids us love, but the artificial system under\r\nwhich we have lived arbitrarily draws a line and says, thus far and no\r\nfurther. Your system may suit disembodied spirits, if such exist, but\r\nnot beings of flesh and blood. It is an outrage on nature. We desire\r\nto leave Egyplosis and return to the common ways of men. We may be\r\nthere unfortunate, but we will be free. This rarified atmosphere\r\nstifles us.\"\r\n\r\nThe high priest was horrified. Never before had a twin-soul been so\r\nsinful, so contumacious. It revealed a state of things too terrible to\r\ncontemplate! If such conduct became contagious, it meant the ruin of\r\nEgyplosis.\r\n\r\nI could detect, however, in the sight of the goddess a certain\r\nsympathy for the prisoners which, perhaps, it would just then be very\r\nimpolitic for her to reveal. It was clear that beneath all this ideal\r\njoy lay a slumbering volcano of passion that only awaited a favorable\r\nmoment for a fierce outbreak. The laws of this strange faith seemed\r\nnot to have contemplated that to avoid temptation is the only security\r\nof moral strength, and that to seek temptation is to paralyze the\r\nmoral fibres of the soul. The high priest grew pale with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware of the enormity of your offence?\" said he to the\r\ndefiant youth. \"For a moment of sinful delight you destroy your\r\ninterregnum of a hundred years of blessedness, and you, each of you,\r\nhave delivered a blow at earthly immortality. The success of our\r\nreligious system is proven by the fact that we have already lengthened\r\nthe life of our hierophants one hundred years, or twice the duration\r\nof life in the outer world of Bilbimtesirol. This is the last of many\r\noutbreaks of _malfeasance_ to vows made in deliberation, and a fresh\r\nexhibition of treason in the sacred college of souls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you this,\" said the youth in reply, \"you are slumbering on the\r\nedge of a volcano. There are thousands of twin-souls ready to cast off\r\nthis yoke. They only await a leader to break out in open revolt!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, we will take care that you are not their leader; we shall\r\nsuppress you, as we have all similar cases, in the cells of the\r\nfortress. Neither Egyplosis nor Atvatabar will hear of your crime. His\r\nmajesty the king will, I have no doubt, acquiesce in the wisdom of\r\nsuch sentence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The punishment is no greater than the crime,\" said the high\r\npriestess. \"I despair of Egyplosis if such crimes become frequent.\r\nWhat will our goddess think, what will Atvatabar think of our holy\r\ntemple when its own priests, the sacred devotees of Harikar, the\r\nministers of the supreme goddess and teachers of the people in their\r\nholy religion, are found traitors? Will the government support\r\nrebellious and sinful souls in every luxury for the senses, with every\r\npossible means for developing and achieving spiritual mastery over the\r\nphysical world, on the sole condition of hopeless love? It will not.\r\nHence, I say, this disobedience must be quenched in the spark, or it\r\nwill break out in ruin to our whole religious institution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your punishment,\" said the high priest, \"unless you will repent of\r\nyour misdeed, give up possession of your offspring, and live ever\r\nafterward as holy priests of hopeless love, will be separate and\r\nsolitary confinement for life in the fortress. You will both be simply\r\nobliterated from the world.\"\r\n\r\nAs the high priest uttered these words the mother-priestess gave a cry\r\nof terror, and, grasping her infant convulsively, gazed with an\r\nappealing glance at the goddess.\r\n\r\n\"We refuse to live as hypocrites,\" said the youth; \"we are no longer\r\ntwin-souls--we are man and wife and demand to be set free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you, each of you,\" said the goddess, \"renounce that obedience\r\nthat makes you factors of deities? Will you dethrone ideal love? Will\r\nyou throw away palaces and gardens and flowers? Will you forswear the\r\ndelight of the companionship of twin-souls?\"\r\n\r\n\"We wish to be set free, your holiness,\" said the youth with firm, set\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"Do you no longer value the secrets of magic and sorcery? Do you\r\nrenounce initiation into the secrets of nature to possess creative\r\nforce to taste the elixir of life, the secret of the transformation of\r\nmetals, and, above all, the blessedness of Nirvana? Knowing that love\r\ndies in possession do you desire to step forth from paradise into a\r\nhard, cold, realistic world, where every experience is a spear driven\r\ninto the flesh?\"\r\n\r\n\"We dare our fate!\" replied the youth. \"We ask you, goddess, to set us\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will bring you both before the spiritual council,\" said Hushnoly,\r\n\"and, as you are aware, the sentence of the council as provided by the\r\nconstitution of Egyplosis will be that you, each of you, be imprisoned\r\nin separate cells for life, and the child removed and cared for in a\r\ndistant part of the kingdom. You will henceforth be obliterated from\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nThe lovers convulsively embraced each other, the beautiful Merga\r\nweeping bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"We will accept the punishment,\" said Ardsolus, \"because we will give\r\ncourage to the many twin-souls already imprisoned and also to those\r\nwho as ardently desire freedom as ourselves. They will never forget\r\nthat we are fighting their battle against a monstrous wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guards, remove the prisoners,\" said the high priest.\r\n\r\n\"Can nothing that I may say mitigate their punishment?\" said the\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\n\"Your holiness is aware,\" said Hushnoly, \"that the laws of Egyplosis\r\nadmit of no other interpretation than that prescribed for such a case\r\nas this. The foundation of the religion of Atvatabar must be preserved\r\nat any cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I urge for mercy,\" said the goddess, who honored the prisoners with\r\nher tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR'S OPINION OF EGYPLOSIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy experiences in Egyplosis were teaching me that even the most\r\nperfect human organizations contain the elements of decay and death.\r\nThe human soul at variance with its own physical condition was hardly\r\nthe best ideal of a god. Here was happiness piled upon happiness, yet\r\nthe recipients thereof were not happy. Disappointments and suffering\r\nare natural to man because life is supported on difficulty, and a\r\nlong-continued happiness is the sure forerunner of disaster. The\r\nreaction of misery lies somewhere concealed from the eye of happiness,\r\nand if it does not at once show itself, it will later on. Even in\r\nwell-guarded happiness, if one single pleasure be omitted, we\r\nexperience more regret at its absence than pleasure over the bounties\r\nwe enjoy. Hence, a large proportion of twin-souls were not wholly in\r\nlove with their life in the temple of souls, however enamored they\r\nwere of each other. Almost absolute freedom of action, freedom from\r\ncare, physical and mental exercises, soul development, the practice of\r\nmagic, the most alluring investigation of mental and spiritual themes,\r\nthe study and practice of art in all its forms, and the investigation\r\nof inventive mechanism; a palace to live in, with vast galleries of\r\npaintings and sculptures, salons for music, and schools of science,\r\nlibraries filled with the rarest works of history, literature and\r\npoetry, and, most precious of all, the daily dalliance with\r\ncounterpart souls, could not make these people happy. The one thing\r\ndenied, which any reasonable man would say was simply the price paid\r\nfor all this glory, was considered the greatest of all misfortunes.\r\nThe imagination has a strange habit of passing lightly over happiness\r\npossessed and settling down upon a little thing beyond reach and\r\nexaggerating it to the utmost.\r\n\r\nThe imprisonment of Ardsolus and Merga created a profound sensation\r\namong the ten thousand inmates of the palace. Sentiment was divided so\r\nmuch that two political parties were formed--those who believed the\r\nerring lovers had met a just fate, and those who thought the system at\r\nfault in providing no means of immediate escape, when to reside in the\r\npalace became imprisonment and a living death to certain souls. The\r\nlatter party was composed of the more youthful section of the\r\npriesthood, who sympathized with the unfortunate lovers. These latter\r\nwould have got up a demonstration in their favor did not the stern\r\nrules of Egyplosis suppress any such outbursts of popular feeling.\r\n\r\nOn the day following the imprisonment of the erring twin-soul, the\r\nquestion was being discussed in the apartments occupied by the\r\nofficers of the _Polar King_ and myself. We had been lodged in a noble\r\nbuilding not far from the palace of the goddess, while the sailors\r\nwere quartered in the fortress of Egyplosis, in company with the\r\nwayleals of the palace itself.\r\n\r\n\"Your opinion of Egyplosis has possibly undergone a change since the\r\nday of our reception,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"I suppose the longer we stay here the more exact will\r\nbe our knowledge of this peculiar institution.\"\r\n\r\nI had considered Egyplosis as a successful institution for developing\r\nthe human soul. Certainly Harikar with his beloved attributes required\r\na fit home for his complete development.\r\n\r\nI had praised their oasis of love, of refinement, of rest, and of\r\nbeauty, and even ventured to assert that such a paradise was the\r\noutcome of the love and purity of twin-souls. I forgot in my\r\nenthusiasm the possibility of the soul being satiated with pleasure,\r\nthat life is a warfare ever seeking but never gaining repose, and that\r\nwe are led more by our passions and illusions than our judgment. I\r\nforgot that while man resists pain he always yields to pleasure. I\r\nforgot that he was created for difficulty, which is the oxygen that\r\nfeeds the flame of endeavor, and that difficulty alone can develop\r\nefforts which pleasure so easily destroys.\r\n\r\n\"I am of the opinion,\" said the doctor, \"that this institution is\r\nfounded on a perversion of human nature. This so-called hopeless love\r\nis, as we have just had proof, one of the most disturbing elements in\r\nlife. Its victims resemble Tantalus, who, though steeped to the lips\r\nin water, can never drink. They are the unhappy devotees of an idol,\r\nand, like the Hindoos, stick into their sides the hooks of a cruel\r\npassion and swing aloft in torture to the applause of an admiring\r\ncrowd.\"\r\n\r\n\"You evidently do not reverence hopeless love?\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I consider Egyplosis,\" he continued, \"but a nervous asylum on a large\r\nscale. This nervous temperament, with its hysterical raptures and\r\ntears, its painful sensibility, its exalted spiritualism and\r\nirresistible sympathy, departs so far from the steady temperate sphere\r\nof action that can alone sustain alike the pleasures and\r\ndisappointments of life as to become the object of pity. These are the\r\nmarks of a mental disease. Ultra-romantic ideas and whimsical and\r\nunaccountable tastes are attributes of this temperament. It is a kind\r\nof insanity, not the insanity proceeding from hopeless mental\r\naberration, but founded on a systematic train of ideas born in a\r\nheated enthusiasm. It may lead, however, to hopeless insanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said the astronomer, \"you are taking a very cold-blooded\r\nview of the subject. You seem not to have discovered that the life\r\nhere is ideal. From what you say one would think that love is a\r\nspecies of insanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is precisely my idea,\" replied the doctor. \"Haven't you observed\r\nhow foolishly people act when in love? All ordinary human prudence and\r\njudgment are thrown aside. Love pares the claws and pulls the teeth of\r\nman as a rational animal. Love is supreme folly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the astronomer, \"the climate of this country has\r\nsomething to do with the present institution. You see that the sun\r\nhere never sets, and, were it not for his diminutive size, would\r\ninfallibly turn the entire interior world into a desert, such as the\r\nmoon is at present, where the outer sun's heat falls for fourteen days\r\non the one spot without intermission, completely blasting her\r\nterritories. The mild yet incessant heat of Swang creates a fervor of\r\nblood and a romance of temperament unknown in lands possessing night,\r\nhence the practices of Egyplosis are a natural result of climatic\r\nconditions. The appetite for ideal love has been created by the\r\nclimate, and the religion of the country very naturally responds to\r\nthe craving of such appetite. Who knows what excesses might not obtain\r\nif no such restraint were imposed on the most gallant youth of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the naturalist, \"that the proper thing to do would be\r\nto have their people imitate the conduct of Jacob of old and Rachel.\r\nJacob worshipped ideal love in the person of Rachel for seven years\r\nand then married, her. If our commander would only propose such a\r\nscheme to the supreme goddess it might possibly be favorably\r\nconsidered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you really suppose,\" said I, \"that I possess any influence with\r\nthe goddess, or that any recommendation of mine would be able to\r\nchange the constitution of Atvatabar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said he, \"if you will allow me to make the remark, I\r\nthink the supreme goddess takes quite as much interest in you as you\r\ndo in her, and would treat your opinions with great respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think more than I have ever dared to think,\" I replied, \"and your\r\nthought savors of sacrilege. The goddess belongs to her faith, her\r\ncountry. To prefer an individual soul is to dethrone herself as\r\ngoddess and meet a painful death.\"\r\n\r\n\"In any case, whatever happens, you can rely on the fidelity of your\r\nfollowers,\" said the naturalist.\r\n\r\nThe subject was fast becoming embarrassing and I merely said:\r\n\"Gentlemen, I am assured of your fidelity; so please let us dismiss\r\nthe subject.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour for rest having been sounded, I sought my couch, but not to\r\nsleep. The remarks made by my companions, emphasized by my growing\r\nfondness for the goddess, set me to thinking what the end would be of\r\nour discovery of Atvatabar. I wondered if Lyone was not, as sung by\r\nher devotees,\r\n\r\n    \"A chrysalis eager to hover\r\n     And fly from her prison away.\"\r\n\r\nCould it be that the goddess might possibly, if an occasion worthy of\r\nsuch a step presented itself, fly from Egyplosis, renounce her throne,\r\nher crown, her sublime office of supreme goddess of Harikar, and with\r\nme retire to some far-off country, braving in the meantime the almost\r\ncertain prospect of death. For her sake I felt I could meet any\r\nsituation, however terrible, but for my sake would she throw aside her\r\nunparalleled dignities? Even if in trying to escape we outflew in my\r\nown vessel their ships of war, we could never escape the ubiquitous\r\nwayleals, the magnic-winged troops that could fight equally well on\r\nland or sea.\r\n\r\nBah! I said, such a dream is idiotic. When I thought of the splendor\r\nof the position that she would be obliged to renounce for the sake of\r\nher love for the passing stranger, and of the awful penalties that\r\nawaited transgression in one so exalted, I considered that no craving\r\nof passion should dare to resist such difficulties.\r\n\r\nHere duty was resistance. Nowhere is man exonerated from the penalty\r\nof having to pay a price for his possessions, and even possession\r\nitself is not happiness. Better, I said to myself, to depart in peace\r\nthan encourage the goddess in a desperate enterprise, if indeed she\r\nhad any such desires as my vanity attributed to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nLYONE'S CONFESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day I again met the goddess in the same magnificent\r\napartment in her palace. She was in a contemplative mood. A white robe\r\nof the finest silk enveloped her, showing to full advantage her superb\r\nfigure. Her silky, shadowed eyes shone with a mild translucent light.\r\nThe ripe beauty of her face was somewhat pale, for some tearful memory\r\npossessed her. Over her shoulders fell the torrent of her hair, while\r\non her brow gleamed a diminutive diadem whose central part was\r\nfashioned like the throne of the gods. She wore a heavy necklace of\r\nshrimp-pink pearls.\r\n\r\nAs we reposed on wide, luxurious couches a maiden of rare beauty\r\nbrought us dishes of curiously-prepared meats and wine of the finest\r\nvintage in flagons of gold. From distant cloisters came wafted the\r\nechoes of singing priestesses breathing their intoxicating Amens.\r\n\r\nLyone had been reciting her past soul experiences, now and then\r\npausing as the story would grow more sacred. To me the revelations of\r\nthe goddess were of breathless interest. I dare not urge her too\r\nforcibly, fearing to break the spell of her confessional mood.\r\n\r\nShe was pleased to say that my advent in Egyplosis had revived the\r\npast as no other event of late times had done. She was willing to\r\nrecall the sweet experiences of her early life, prior to her elevation\r\nto the throne of the goddess.\r\n\r\nI knew she was in that mood when confession to a kindred soul is most\r\nconsoling to the heart. I urged her to continue the story.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she continued, \"my parents, who were people of importance in\r\nCalnogor, had destined me for marriage and the outer world, but before\r\nI even knew of Egyplosis I had a day dream. I saw with my waking eyes\r\nthis temple-palace as one might see it in a picture, splendid as the\r\nreality. I saw myself with a youth of noble aspect standing in a court\r\nof the garden, and his arm was around me. He was tall and shapely as a\r\npalm tree and was all tenderness and devotion. The picture vanished,\r\nyet its influence remained. It utterly transformed me from the\r\nundreaming girl that I was to a soul active and ardent, already\r\nexperienced in what life really was. I learned that the mystery of\r\nlife was love, and longed for spiritual companionship with an inmate\r\nof Egyplosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the dream fulfilled as you expected it would be?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly as I anticipated,\" said Lyone. \"I entered Egyplosis in spite\r\nof the earnest desire of my people to remain in the outer world and\r\nlead a life of barren conventionality.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you not learned,\" I inquired, \"that it was impossible to overleap\r\nthe purposes of nature without paying a penalty therefor, that ideal\r\npassion will in time give way to the commonplace, just as water\r\nfollows the law of gravity?\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew nothing but that ideal love might be eternal. It is the\r\npassion that makes a goddess human and the mortal divine. Within a\r\nmonth after entering the temple walls I discovered the very reality of\r\nthe image I had seen years before. He was my twin-soul, my lover, my\r\ngod. At our first meeting we simultaneously burst into tears. It was\r\nan ecstasy in which the body did not participate to any marked extent,\r\nbut belonged purely to the region of the soul. We accepted the vows\r\nmade at the installation of a twin-soul and became a completed\r\ncircle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Being the goddess,\" I said, \"your lover must have died?\"\r\n\r\n\"He died some years ago,\" she said, \"and on his death, by reason of my\r\nwidowhood, my gifts, my spirituality, my love and my beauty, I was\r\nelevated to the throne of the gods when vacant, and was worshipped as\r\nsupreme goddess of the faith. It is utterly against our laws for a\r\ngoddess to choose another counterpart; she is supposed to belong only\r\nto Harikar, the ideal soul whom also she symbolizes; hence I am\r\nobliged to dwell largely alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You doubtless regret the loss of your earthly counterpart?\" I urged.\r\n\r\n\"Regret it! Ah, that was life!\" she said, \"for my soul then knew what\r\nspiritual freedom means. I experienced ecstatic agonies, bliss was\r\npain and pain paradise. I flew as a bird full of anguish, bearing\r\ntreasures of love and tears. I desired self-sacrifice, I wanted to\r\nsmile on every one, to help every one. I loved life; I had no fear of\r\ndeath. My capacity for rapture seemed to expand continually. Every\r\nscene I gazed upon trembled in a new blaze of delight. Thoughts, like\r\nlightning, rent open new worlds of passion and tenderness, wherein I\r\nmoved as a goddess peerless and supreme. But when the tomb closed upon\r\nmy heart of hearts I begged them to lay me by his side and seal the\r\ndoor upon us forever. The glory of life had departed, and day after\r\nday I swooned upon the sarcophagus that held my treasure, my life.\"\r\n\r\nLyone was unusually excited, and to divert her attention from the past\r\nI spoke of the present, of her proud position as supreme goddess of\r\nAtvatabar.\r\n\r\n\"How does it affect you,\" I exclaimed, \"to be the recipient of such\r\nadoration as you receive as goddess?\"\r\n\r\n\"At first it was soul maddening,\" she replied; \"I thought I should\r\nnever be able to sustain such adoration. My soul, blinded and\r\nbewildered by the incense of song and prayer, seemed unable to bear\r\nthe intoxication. Even yet, as I sit upon the throne of the gods,\r\nfantastic, astonishing emotions thrill me into swooning away. Oh, it\r\nis incomparably glorious to hear around you those earthquake surges of\r\nprayer, to see souls quivering with adoring love. I feel at times as\r\nthough I were the cone of a volcano radiating fire and flame into a\r\nburning sky!\r\n\r\n\"Then, again, I smile, and feel as I smile that I have power over life\r\nand death--oh, you do not know what love is--you do not know its\r\ntremendous power until you feel its splendid flame breathed from ten\r\nthousand souls clasping your shrieking soul in a blood-crimson\r\nembrace! If thoughts be things it makes me a creator. If thoughts can\r\nchisel matter, then I am gracious in face and figure. Men say my flesh\r\nis smooth as marble, soft as velvet, and bright as gold, even as the\r\nforms of our priests and priestesses are sculptured and colored by the\r\nthoughts of love.\r\n\r\n\"Only a goddess knows such thoughts as hers that burn in the soul like\r\nfluid gold. Imagination fills me at times with vast and phantasmal\r\nsplendors. Adoration glorifies me like light raining on the palms and\r\npalaces. I see shapes of burning sweetness, and the air around me is\r\nladen with the caresses of heavy, strange perfumes. Unclothed\r\nraptures, exquisitely soft and tender, surround me, like heaven\r\nopening its wings of flame upon the world. Happy voices, ringing in\r\nthe sensuous arcades of music, fall on my ears, the blown spray of\r\nimmortal friendships.\r\n\r\n\"Yet, is it not strange that all these delights, violent and glorious\r\nas they are, do not wholly satisfy the soul? I continually long for\r\nsomething sweeter yet. It seems the greater the joy the more enormous\r\nthe capacity, and no joy completely fills the ever-expanding soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think,\" said I, \"that even the rapture of a goddess is not wholly\r\nadequate to create a feeling of repletion of satisfaction in a soul\r\nsuch as yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is contrary to our laws to think so, yet at times I know I could\r\nforego even the throne of the gods itself for the pure and intimate\r\nlove of a counterpart soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not so desirous of the human soul in its collective form as\r\nyou are of individual soul wholly yours?\" I ventured, shaken with a\r\nquivering thrill.\r\n\r\n\"The soul ever seeks that which is beyond and individual,\" said Lyone;\r\n\"having once loved the individual soul, I know what such holy rapture\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the difficulties to be surmounted in your quest of a\r\ncounterpart soul?\" I inquired, with a secret delight.\r\n\r\n\"The sacrilege of a goddess becoming attached to the individual to the\r\nexclusion of all other individuals. The goddess-elect must have been\r\na novitiate and priestess of Egyplosis and the survivor of her\r\ncounterpart soul. Her experiences as a noble and pure priestess,\r\ntogether with special beauty and popularity, are the conditions for\r\nthe peerless office of supreme goddess and incarnation of Harikar. By\r\nher vows she can never again become the exclusive possession of any\r\none soul. She belongs to Harikar, the universal soul.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the punishment for renunciation of your office and\r\nattachment to another soul?\"\r\n\r\n\"A shameful death by magnicity for the twin-soul. No goddess can\r\nresign her office. No goddess can seek a lover and live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even an ideal affinity?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, even ideal affinities who forget themselves are punished with\r\nlifelong imprisonment, and their names blotted out of the priesthood\r\nas though they were dead,\" said Lyone.\r\n\r\n\"Are there many such transgressors of their vows in Egyplosis?\" I\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"There are, I believe, some five hundred twin-souls at present immured\r\nin the dungeons,\" said Lyone.\r\n\r\n\"Poor souls!\" I murmured, \"their apostasy was but their reformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I often think of them,\" said Lyone, \"but I know I can never liberate\r\nthem except by my own successful apostasy. And yet when all else is\r\npeaceful and happy, or at least appears so, why should I become the\r\nleader of an insurrection that would precipitate a hundred times more\r\nmisery on the nation, to say nothing of the possibility of defeat?\"\r\n\r\nI saw that a crisis had come to Lyone, a tremendous debate agitated\r\nher soul. I forebore treading further on the sacred ground. She, with\r\ntrue delicacy, was striving to hide the intensity of her proud unrest.\r\nI felt that in time she would have the courage to take the irrevocable\r\nstep that led to freedom or death.\r\n\r\nAs I sat devouring every word spoken by Lyone I felt a strange power\r\nsurrounding me, an emanation of the soul of my beloved friend. I\r\nresisted for a long time a sacrilegious desire to fling myself at her\r\nfeet and clasp her in my arms. I thought of her supreme dignity, her\r\nlove for her faith and her people, and I knew one cold glance from her\r\neyes would pierce me through and through like a sword. The more I\r\nthought of my position at that moment the more amazed I became at\r\nthe audacity that led me to ever think of claiming the soul of the\r\ngoddess as mine, much less my encouragement of an enterprise so\r\ndesperate as we had already assuredly embarked upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HER KISS WAS A BLINDING WHIRLWIND OF FLAME AND TEARS!\r\nIT WAS THE PROCLAMATION OF WAR UPON ATVATABAR. THENCEFORTH WE BECAME A\r\nNEW AND FORMIDABLE TWIN-SOUL.]\r\n\r\nAs I gazed in adoration at the splendid soul before me the scene\r\nthrough the open windows seemed to grow more ideal. There was a new\r\nglory in the gardens around me, a finer flashing of fountains in the\r\nsunlight, and a bolder chiselling of palaces and temples. Beyond and\r\nabove there wheeled the roof of the world, with its still more\r\nprodigious forests and mountains and a wider expanse of gleaming seas.\r\n\r\nI sprang forward with a cry of joy, falling at the feet of the\r\ngoddess. I encircled her figure with my arms and held up my face to\r\nhers. Her kiss was a blinding whirlwind of flame and tears! Its\r\nsilence was irresistible entreaty. It dissolved all other interests\r\nlike fire melting stubborn steel. It was the proclamation of war upon\r\nAtvatabar! It was the destruction of a unique civilization with all\r\nits appurtenances of hopeless love. It was love defying death.\r\nThenceforward we became a new and formidable twin-soul!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nOUR VISIT TO THE INFERNAL PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe infernal palace was a congregation of subterranean rock-hewn\r\ntemples under the spiritual control of the grand sorcerer Charka and\r\nthe grand sorceress Zooly-Soase.\r\n\r\nThe grand sorcerer's dominion was directly underneath the supernal\r\npalace of Egyplosis. An ornate pagoda of stone covered the entrance to\r\nthe underground palace. The descent was by means of a wide gradient of\r\npolished marble, and there was also an elevator car, beautifully\r\ndecorated with electro-plated sheets of gold and lit by electricity,\r\nwhich was the most rapid means of descent to the pavement beneath, a\r\ndistance of two hundred and fifty feet. The procession of twin-souls\r\nand attendants, who carried Lyone and myself in a splendid litter of\r\ngold, entered the palace by means of the inclined marble highway whose\r\nsculptured walls were radiant with electric light. The many temples of\r\nthe underground palace were devoted to the most occult worship of\r\nHarikar. There was an immense central edifice whose roof, supported by\r\nlofty columns, and sculptured in fantastic beauty, rose two hundred\r\nfeet above the pavement. Here electric suns lit up what was merely the\r\nvestibule of a hundred temples all hewn from the same pale green\r\nmarble, the aquelium floors glimmering like a fathomless sea.\r\n\r\nAs we entered this splendid abode of sorcery, we were received by the\r\naugust officials of the sanctuary. The grand sorcerer Charka was a man\r\nof imperial presence, gracious and subtle. His flesh was of the hue of\r\nsilver bronze and he possessed noble features. His hair was blue and\r\nhis blue beard was trimmed into a rounded semi-circle on his chin,\r\nwhile his mustache spread nobly on either side of his lips. He wore a\r\nrobe of emerald blue silk, embroidered with silver flowers. The grand\r\nsorceress, Thoubool who accompanied him, possessed the complexion of a\r\npearl, was arrayed in a robe of celestial blue silk, and, like the\r\ngrand sorcerer, wore a diadem of rubies.\r\n\r\nOur reception was extremely gracious, the grand sorcerer saying he\r\nfelt highly honored with our visit.\r\n\r\nAs we passed down the palace pavement, an immense bell opened its\r\nmouth of gaunt and glorious bronze. Soft explosions of music swept in\r\nthrilling moans through temple and cloister, the echoing walls\r\nresounding with ritournels of enthusiastic peace. As if inspired with\r\npassion, I could hear the bell swing and roll on its delirious pivot\r\nuttering its deep-sounding fantasy.\r\n\r\nI saw, illuminating the sculptured archway of each temple on either\r\nside of us, the name thereof in letters of incandescent light. I saw\r\nthe names Amano, Biccano, Demano, Hirlano, Kilano, Pridano, Redolano,\r\nEcthyano, Oxemano, Jiracano, Oirelano, Orphitano, Cedeshano, Padomano,\r\nJocdilano, Nidialano, Bischomano, Omdolopano and many others,\r\nindicating the various departments of soul development to which each\r\ntemple was dedicated.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer waved his wand and suddenly a band of priestesses\r\nappeared on the pavement moving in strange and fantastic measures.\r\nTheir attire consisted of low-cut circles of bright and beautiful\r\nstuffs with short skirts, having in front of each a sheaf of heavy\r\nfolds that expanded and fell as the dancer moved. All wore jewels and\r\nrings of precious metals on wrists and ankles. Their faces, perfect in\r\nfeature, were pale rose in color but marvellously delicate. Ranging\r\nthemselves on either side of the immense aisle, they formed a\r\ndelightful guard of honor for the grand sorcerer and his retinue.\r\n\r\nThey were not only souls, but the materializations of souls, that\r\ndanced and sang as when on earth. They were souls of former\r\npriestesses reincarnated by the sorcerer and who vanished when we\r\nreached the entrance to the temple of the labyrinth. It certainly was\r\na delicate and superexcited imagination that wrought the splendid\r\narchway through which we passed into the grotto garden beyond. Neither\r\nGreek nor Moor, Hindoo nor Goth ever conceived such arabesques as were\r\nsculptured on the walls of the entrance to the holy of holies.\r\n\r\nIn the garden, hewn from the solid stone, were interminable thickets\r\nand hedges enclosing labyrinthine walks. There were open spaces in\r\nwhich stood veritable trees with strangest leaf and flower, branch and\r\nstem delicately chiselled from the solid rock. There were also acres\r\nof grass and flowers, wonderful creations of art. There were rose\r\nbushes, heavy with their eternal bloom, the flowers stained crimson as\r\nin life and the leaves their varying gradations of green.\r\n\r\nFruit trees, with pale pink flowers and leaves light and dark green,\r\nstood amid the green grass that never waved in the breeze. An\r\nimmovable streamlet ran down its bed of carved irregularities between\r\nflowery banks and underneath a bridge formed of a single arch.\r\n\r\nI looked up expecting to see the sky, but my gaze met the solid\r\nheavens of stone, and I knew again I was in a cavern. The feeling was\r\nsomewhat suffocating. The garden was lit by an electric sun in the\r\ncentre of the roof two hundred feet overhead. The pathway, wide enough\r\nfor six people abreast, led by labyrinthine dells to the pagoda of the\r\nsorcerer, which stood in the centre of the garden. The mazes of the\r\npathway were so numerous that none save the initiated, when once in\r\nthe labyrinth, could find their way out again.\r\n\r\nIt was a weird experience to find myself walking between the master\r\ntwin-souls of that subterranean paradise, exploring its many\r\nmysteries.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in due time at the entrance to a mighty temple at the\r\nfurther side of the labyrinth, whose bronze door suddenly opened to\r\nreceive us, and the sorcerer bade me enter.\r\n\r\nPassing through a pillared porch we entered a wide and lofty space\r\nlit by tall windows and a roof of many-colored domes of glass that\r\nthrew wonderful lights on the polished aquelium floors of the\r\nbuilding. The light that shone through window and dome was produced by\r\nmyriads of electric incandescent lamps that glowed in recesses of the\r\nrock behind each window. This was the inmost shrine of the sorcerer.\r\n\r\nAs I walked toward the centre of the mysterious temple the sorcerer\r\ninquired if creative magic was cultivated on the outer sphere.\r\n\r\nI informed the sorcerer that necromancy, divination, magic,\r\nclairvoyance, esotericism, and theosophy were things known and\r\npractised in many countries. \"But,\" I added, \"the idea there is that\r\nof self-abnegation and miracles are only to be performed by ascetics\r\nwho practise the most rigid austerities. Men who desire to possess\r\noccult power live in complete solitude, subjecting themselves to cruel\r\nmortifications. They abstain from all fellowship with their kind, they\r\ntry to live even without food. They absolutely mourn existence,\r\navoiding all contact with everything earthly. They hope by renouncing\r\nall the actions of life to enter more and more into the spiritual\r\nexistence. They believe they can build up an enormous soul out of the\r\nruins of the body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you find that such a method produces a high development of\r\ncreative power, love, justice, conscience, truth, temperance, order,\r\nand benevolence?\" said the grand sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say,\" I replied, \"that the devotees to whom I refer are\r\nconspicuous for those qualities, certainly not for a highly active\r\nstate of such qualities. Their abnegation develops fanaticism, which\r\nis intemperance itself, and fills them with hate toward those outside\r\ntheir creed. The starvation of every appetite of pleasure withers up\r\nthe appreciation for every form of human delight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what virtues are derived from ascetic practices?\" inquired the\r\nsorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"Certain virtues of a negative order,\" I replied. \"The adepts claim to\r\nhave power to create and transport matter; a claim which reliable\r\nhistory does not, except in a few cases, recognize, and in a very\r\nlimited sense they have power to separate the soul from the body.\r\nWhile the body remains in a comatose state, the soul traverses space,\r\nholds consultation with similar souls, and returns to its mansion in\r\nthe body again.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LABYRINTH WAS A SUBTERRANEAN GARDEN, WHOSE TREES\r\nAND FLOWERS WERE CHISELED OUT OF THE LIVING ROCK.]\r\n\r\n\"Your magicians,\" said the sorcerer, \"weaken or kill the body without\r\nimparting corresponding power to the soul. Now we of Atvatabar believe\r\nthat the body should be developed equally with the soul. We believe\r\nthat contact with the noblest and best of earthly things develops\r\npower and beauty. We feed both body and soul on the perfection of\r\nthings, that both may thereby absorb perfection.\r\n\r\n\"In the brilliant activities of the supernal palace, and in the golden\r\ncalm of the infernal palace, priest and priestess, as twin souls,\r\nnaturally intermingle in the enjoyment of a long Nirvana of ecstasy.\r\nWe have not only the occult power to perform miracles like the\r\nascetics of the outer sphere, but the soul possesses an enormous\r\ndevelopment of every noble quality without which our golden century is\r\nimpossible. We are able by means of our baths of life to obtain a\r\nhundred years of glorious youth, during which period age and decay of\r\nthe body is suspended. Our devotees when they arrive at the age of\r\ntwenty years, when youth is fully developed, begin their Nirvana of\r\nblessedness and love. They do not grow older during these years. The\r\neye is as bright, the pulse as bounding, the heart as lively, the\r\ncomplexion as pure and lovely, the feelings as fresh, at the end of\r\nthe interregnum as at its commencement. Then when the golden century\r\nis exhausted, the body begins to be twenty-one years old.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that a man who has lived one hundred and thirty years is\r\nbut thirty years old?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely,\" said the sorcerer; \"why should we call a period age in\r\nwhich there is no change?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do all souls live until their century of youth is accomplished?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not all souls. Many die of accident or in consequence of sin. With\r\nsome, Nirvana consists of but a single day's felicity, with others a\r\nmonth, or a year, up to a hundred years. It is the ideal for which we\r\nstrive, and there is no reason why the body should not live one\r\nthousand years as well as one hundred, when vitality becomes more\r\ndeveloped.\"\r\n\r\nI was astonished at the remarks of the sorcerer, and yet I remembered\r\nthe case of Adam, Noah, and Methusaleh. I told him that men on the\r\nouter sphere had lived almost one thousand years.\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure they never practised the austerities of the ascetic\r\nlife you have just mentioned. They must have enjoyed life always\r\nturning their faces to the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think one hundred years a great step toward immortality,\" I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"At twenty years the body is developed, but even a hundred thousand\r\nyears will not develop the soul. Think of the development involved in\r\nhaving power over disease and death, power to create substantialities\r\nof matter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you create matter?\" I inquired breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"I will show you what we can do,\" replied the sorcerer; \"if you will\r\nfollow me.\"\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer led the way to seats upon a platform of silver, on which\r\nstood in terrific grandeur the figure of a hehorrent, or dragon of\r\ngold, whose eyes were blazing rubies. He stood before the dragon, at\r\nleast twenty feet above the pavement of the palace.\r\n\r\nPresently the sorcerer shouted with a loud voice, \"My host! my host!\"\r\nand at once several thousand twin souls thronged into the immense\r\ntemple, dancing with naked feet on the polished aquelium pavement.\r\nBeneath the monster miles of wire were wound in a coil, and to the\r\nwire were attached twenty thousand fine wires of terrelium, each wire\r\nterminating in a terrelium wand. These wires were held one each by\r\npriest and priestess, who began to move in a strange dance on the\r\npavement and sing an anthem to Harikar. As they moved more and more\r\nrapidly the clamor of bells arose, and explosions of sound, like\r\nbullets rained upon drums, shook the building. In the semi-darkness\r\nthe body of the hehorrent seemed to quiver, and, as I gazed, lo! a\r\nshower of blazing jewels issued from its mouth. There were emeralds,\r\ndiamonds, sapphires, and rubies flung upon the pavement, scintillating\r\nwith fire the colors of the stones themselves!\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer, waving his terrelium wand, shouted, \"Hold! It is\r\nenough!\" and the seance was at an end. He received the jewels that had\r\nbeen collected by his hierophants, and descending, offered me a\r\nsplendid ruby as large as a hen's egg. I looked at him with awe, as I\r\nfelt its size and weight. He simply said, \"These jewels have been\r\ncreated by spirit power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you,\" I gasped, with a feeling of mingled exultance and fear, \"do\r\nyou create matter?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AS I GAZED, LO! A SHOWER OF BLAZING JEWELS ISSUED FROM\r\nTHE MOUTH OF THE HEHORRENT.]\r\n\r\n\"The abnegation of hopeless love is the source of the spirit power\r\nby which we create matter such as this,\" replied the sorcerer. \"The\r\ntwin-soul is the cell that generates the creative force.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you create other matter than jewels?\" I eagerly inquired.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer gazed at Lyone for a moment, who had been strangely\r\nsilent in the presence of her most powerful spiritual coadjutor, and\r\nthen replied: \"Yes, we can create all things if necessary. We can, for\r\nexample, create islands in the sea, with mountains, forests, lakes,\r\nvalleys, winding walks and thickets of flowers, palaces and pagodas.\"\r\n\r\nI was breathless with excitement at such a reply. \"Oh, that I could\r\nsee such an island,\" I rejoined, \"and tread, if but for a single hour,\r\nits ecstatic shores!\"\r\n\r\n\"You can both see it and walk upon it, if the goddess so wills it,\"\r\nreplied the sorcerer. \"What is the command of your holiness?\" he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"I would like the commander to see Arjeels, if your priests and\r\npriestesses are willing to perform the necessarily arduous ritual\r\ninvolved in its creation,\" replied Lyone.\r\n\r\n\"My hierophants,\" replied the sorcerer, \"are only too happy to serve\r\ntheir goddess at all times, and I will at once command them to prepare\r\nto execute the ritual for creating the magical island of Arjeels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your devotion,\" said Lyone, \"fills me with the purest joy.\"\r\n\r\nAs we conversed, the large ruby I held in my hand had grown\r\nconsiderably less in size, as though the elements of which it was\r\ncomposed had to a degree evaporated as unseen gases, so that in a\r\nshort time the jewel might wholly disappear. The sorcerer,\r\nanticipating an inquiry as to its disappearance, stated that all\r\nobjects created by spirit power could only be maintained in their full\r\nmaterial splendor so long as they were sustained by the power that\r\ngave them birth. The creations were not additions to already existing\r\nelements; they were simply focalizations of matter from the elements\r\nof the surrounding world, held together by the force that withdrew\r\nthem from their normal habitat as long as the spirit power remains\r\nsupplied. The jewels would in a few hours cease to exist, because they\r\nwere not enfolded with the power that produced them.\r\n\r\n\"As to your magical island,\" said I, addressing Lyone, one of whose\r\ntitles was Princess of Arjeels, \"where is your principality situated?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is located anywhere in the wide sea,\" said Lyone.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say,\" said I, \"that Arjeels is not a real, veritable\r\nisland of the ocean, but only a ghostly island, a mirage that retreats\r\nas we approach it, a phantasy of the imagination?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arjeels is a real island, with real rocks and waterfalls, lakes and\r\nforests, birds and flowers. There is a real palace, and all the\r\nappurtenances of an ideal life. All this is a materialization of the\r\nideal desires.\"\r\n\r\nI was astonished at her reply. \"Once called into being,\" I inquired,\r\n\"how long can the island exist?\"\r\n\r\n\"So long as the twin-souls support it by never-ceasing ecstasy, so\r\nlong as they perform their magical dances on the aquelium floor of the\r\ntemple of the dragon, holding in their hands the terrelium wands. Once\r\nthe island becomes materialized it requires thousands of twin-souls to\r\nsustain and preserve its reality, and it only vanishes when the\r\ntwin-souls are utterly weary of their ecstasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when the twin-souls grow weary of their joys, what becomes of the\r\nisland and its glories?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"We can preserve the island for a long time,\" said the sorcerer, \"by\r\nhaving fresh dancers take the place of those that are exhausted, but\r\nafter the lapse of a month, or longer, when all are utterly vanquished\r\nwith fatigue, the spirit power becomes exhausted and the island\r\ndisappears upon the sea.\"\r\n\r\nI rose and enthusiastically grasped the sorcerer by the hand. \"Ah,\r\ndear sorcerer,\" said I, \"will you show me this magical island?\"\r\n\r\n\"The command of the Princess of Arjeels,\" he replied, \"will be\r\nobeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nARJEELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was full of impatience to witness the creation of the magical\r\nisland, where with Lyone I might find ideal delight. It was necessary,\r\nhowever, for the grand sorcerer to make ample arrangements, not only\r\nfor the generation of sufficient spirit force to create the island,\r\nbut also a force sufficient for its continuance for an indefinite\r\nlength of time. It was absolutely necessary that there should be a\r\nreserve force of ten thousand twin-souls to take the places of the\r\noriginal legion of souls, when they would become weary of their\r\necstatic labors. Only once before had Arjeels been created, and it was\r\nthought a most wonderful thing that the sorcerer could preserve its\r\nexistence for a single day. Now it was contemplated to sustain the\r\nisland for months, and this required a continuous as well as a lavish\r\nexpenditure of spirit power.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer had enlisted his full quota of twin-souls, and prepared\r\nthem for their heroic duty. The terrelium wand held by each soul was\r\nconnected with the wires of a helic having immense coils of terrelium,\r\nthat held by a rampant hehorrent of gold, formed an immense spiritual\r\nbattery in the centre of another subterranean temple. Wires led from\r\nthe battery underground across Atvatabar to the city of Mylosis, on\r\nthe seacoast most remote from Kioram, a thousand miles from Egyplosis.\r\nThe sorcerer announced a few days after the visit to the infernal\r\npalace that he was ready to accompany us to Mylosis, whither the\r\nqueen's golden yacht had been sent to meet us.\r\n\r\nThe aerial yacht of the goddess flew swiftly over Atvatabar, bearing\r\nthe precious Lyone, the grand sorcerer Charka, and myself to the far\r\nseacoast, the first stage in our journey.\r\n\r\nThe brightly flashing seas, the rose-colored sun, and the transcendent\r\nconcave of the earth encompassing us, with the near tropical splendor\r\nof the country, made a scene of long remembered joy. But these\r\nobjects, so glorious in themselves, were made still more splendid by\r\nthe love that reigned in the souls that contemplated them.\r\n\r\nIn due time we reached Mylosis, where we found the royal yacht and a\r\nreverent crowd of people awaiting us.\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer lost no time in connecting the subterranean wires with a\r\ncable of terrelium on board the yacht, and, this being done, we\r\nimmediately set out to sea, followed by a crowd of pleasure ships,\r\nconveying a host of people anxious to witness the miracle about to be\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nWe anchored the yacht at a distance of fifty miles from the coast. The\r\ngrand sorcerer, surrounded by his acolytes, held in his hand a thick\r\nrod of terrelium, the extreme end of the cable, whose further\r\nextremity was connected with the battery in the Temple of\r\nReincarnation at Egyplosis. An exchange of messages along the wire\r\ninformed us that the ten thousand twin-souls had already begun their\r\ndance of Pure Being upon the pavement of the greater temple.\r\nImmediately a stream of flame leaped from the end of the rod, like\r\nwater spouting from a tube under enormous pressure.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the sorcerer, \"by virtue of the spirit power in this\r\ncable, what I will to exist, will exist. I will that the magical\r\nisland of Arjeels shall rise above the waves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish the island,\" said Lyone, \"to have an elevation of five\r\nthousand feet in the centre, and at an elevation of four thousand feet\r\nfill a crater of the mountain with a lake of cool water surrounded by\r\naerial gardens, and on the shore place a palace of rose-colored\r\nmarble, luxuriously furnished, with servants to wait upon us. All else\r\nmay be according to your own fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"As your majesty wishes,\" replied the sorcerer, and as he spoke, a\r\nhigh mountain rose instantly from the sea a mile away, creating\r\nenormous waves, that threatened the safety of the yacht and the\r\ncongregated vessels. A feeling of awe silenced the host of spectators.\r\n\r\nInstantly, as quickly as the sorcerer moved his wand, the mountains\r\nbecame clothed with forests, and high up on the shoulder of the\r\ncentral peak appeared a palace of rose-colored marble, whose\r\nsupernatural architecture seemed a celestial dream. The island was\r\nthirty miles in length and about fifteen in width. From immense\r\ncliffs, foaming waterfalls flung themselves downward to the sea.\r\nDazzled with their blinding beauty, we saw ravines engorged with\r\nflowers. In green and glorious blessedness the island lay before us,\r\ncomplete, like an enormous emerald in a setting of blue sea. We were\r\nso awe-struck with the labors of the sorcerer, that it seemed a\r\nsacrilege to set foot on the miraculous shores of Arjeels.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from the sorcerer, the captain of the yacht fired one\r\nhundred guns, and the vessel moved toward the romantic island. We came\r\nclose up to a white marble wharf, and Lyone and myself alighted upon\r\nthe sacred retreat. Everything seemed so natural, that we could\r\nscarcely believe the solid rock to be sustained by self-sacrificing\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"BY VIRTUE OF THE SPIRIT POWER IN THIS CABLE,\" SAID THE\r\nSORCERER, \"I WILL THAT THE MAGICAL ISLAND OF ARJEELS SHALL RISE ABOVE\r\nTHE WAVES.\"]\r\n\r\nThe adorable sorcerer remained on board the vessel, as it was\r\nimpossible for him to leave his post of duty for a moment, while the\r\ndazed yet happy inhabitants of Mylosis departed homeward in their\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that when the spirit power that sustained the island\r\nwould become exhausted, owing to the utter weariness of the\r\ntwin-souls, the firing of a gun on board the yacht would be a signal\r\nthat Arjeels would disappear from upon the sea.\r\n\r\nThe moment both Lyone and myself stepped upon the magical soil we felt\r\nan instantaneous increase of health and vigor. We did not at first use\r\nour magnic wings for flight, but walked along paths that wound around\r\nthe beach of golden sand, shaded by towering palms.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining for a time on the margin of the sea we rose on our\r\nwings, and, like birds, encircled the island, rising ever higher until\r\nwe alighted before the palace created for Lyone, a gem of the rosiest\r\nmarble, covered with a dome of gold that flashed around it the light\r\nof the sun. The architecture was broad and heavy with splendid\r\ncarvings, and surrounded by a pillared portico. The palace stood on\r\nthe shore of a beautiful sheet of cool water; elsewhere its shores\r\nwere thickly clothed with tropic foliage and aerial gardens of the\r\ngreatest beauty.\r\n\r\nWe had reached at last the holy of holies of ideal attainment, a\r\nretreat of bewildering beauty. The weird and splendid proportions of\r\nthe palace, with its domes and towers ornamented with sculptured\r\narabesques, rising from the soft waters of the lake, a veritable\r\nFountain of Youth, all surrounded by the green and gleaming forest and\r\ngardens without end, filled our souls with a new rapture. Everything\r\nwas so perfect and peaceful, so rich with life and beauty, so fresh\r\nand sparkling, so unspeakably happy, that I said, \"This is the end of\r\nall toil and ambition, this is the perfect flower of life. Here is the\r\nlake of immortality, and here the fabled gardens of the Hesperides.\"\r\n\r\nRayoulb, the chamberlain of the palace, and his acolytes, who received\r\nus, were also the product of spirit power, the reincarnation of former\r\ninmates of Egyplosis. They awaited us before the palace, announcing a\r\nfeast had already been prepared for us.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the palace revealed new wonders. Wide and lofty\r\nchambers were hung, some with woven and painted tapestries, and some\r\nplated with sheets of gold, illuminated by electricity with\r\nmany-colored designs in precious metal. Others were decorated with\r\ntender and brilliant frescoes, in which the transparent plaster seemed\r\nto hold in its depths the tones of gold, of ultramarine and vermilion,\r\nin fabulous scenes. Woven and painted tapestries clothed the walls of\r\nstill other chambers, representing in entrancing colors the most\r\noccult mysteries of Egyplosis. The banqueting chamber had a dome of\r\nenamelled glass, that softened the light with many a caressing color.\r\nPorcelain vases, gorgeous in depth and richness of color, containing\r\nplants of the richest bloom, added to the apartment their decorative\r\ngrace. There were also an art gallery, a library, and a museum of\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the palace a square cloistered arcade surrounded a\r\nmarble court. In the centre of the court lay a square pool of crystal\r\nwater, whose basin had been chiselled out of the solid rock. The pool\r\nwas fed by a wide water-fall falling down a precipice on the pavement.\r\nHere also were several pagodas containing chimes of bells and large\r\noblong vases of stone filled with blooming flowers.\r\n\r\nAmid such splendor I began to realize that love has the power of\r\nspiritualizing all things, of interfusing them with its own rapture.\r\nUnder its flame all colors brighten, all movement becomes divine, all\r\nlabor seems holy. The sea attains a deeper blue, the shores a brighter\r\ngreen, the beloved one becomes more beautiful, more delicate and\r\nsupernatural. Love, indeed, is an ultramarine and ultramontane joy!\r\n\r\n\"This delight,\" said Lyone as she lay in her boudoir, plunged in\r\ndelicious blessedness, \"fills my soul with universal peace. Hitherto\r\npained with the chagrin of life, I welcome this unwonted repose. Oh, I\r\nam supremely happy!\"\r\n\r\n\"This expedition,\" I replied, \"is not to observe the transit of Venus,\r\nbut the possession of Venus, to weigh each other's souls and read the\r\npoetry written in every fold of the heart. It would be the perfection\r\nof life if such reality of the ideal could surround us forever, but in\r\na world where the worm doth conquer, where the storm wastes the flower\r\nand herb, such felicity is purchased only by the sacrifice of\r\nourselves or of others. But while it lasts let us prize its ineffable\r\njoy. Hitherto,\" I continued, \"philosophy has said that if we do not\r\nwant to be undeceived we should never visit the haunts of\r\nimagination, for the fruits thereof are ashes, but we will create a\r\nnew philosophy, that will assert that the haunts of imagination are\r\nideally real, that the veritable Fountain of Youth has been\r\ndiscovered, that Eldorado may be won.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day found us floating on the lake before, the palace in\r\na beautiful magnic boat. Musicians occupied a pagoda overlooking the\r\nlake, and made the air sweet with their music. The lake seemed to fill\r\nthe crater of an extinct volcano, and miles away on its further shore\r\nrose the lofty precipices of a mountain crest. It was most delightful\r\nto float on its profound wave, at an elevation of four thousand feet,\r\nand yet see the sea beneath us, and we surrounded with all the glory\r\nof the interior world.\r\n\r\nBirds, gorgeous as humming-birds, resplendent in burnished hues of\r\npurple, garnet, and green, would flash amid the flowers, or chase each\r\nother over the water. As for ourselves, we no longer feared our own\r\nholiest emotions. Our deepest feelings were then in the foreground.\r\nThe mysterious carmine on the palpitating lips of Lyone was the symbol\r\nof a warm, delicate, superexcited soul.\r\n\r\nLyone grew day by day more and more beautiful. She resembled the color\r\nof a deep and mysterious gold. I crowned her brow with flowers and\r\nwreathed her azure hair with wistful daffodils.\r\n\r\nAnother day we rode on soul-created horses to discover the odoriferous\r\nretreats of the island. The pathways wound through flowery ravines,\r\nthat looked out upon the sea. The sweet cool air that filled the\r\nsplendid gloom of the palm woods seemed the essence of gladness. What\r\nglorious vistas opened amid the luminous green of the forest! The\r\nmurmur of music filled the infinite ways of the island as our\r\ncavalcade wound round its peerless hills or plunged into its abysses\r\nof flowers. The spell of an ideal land was upon us, and we experienced\r\nsensations hitherto unfelt in life.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Lyone, \"is the ideal climate. Everything has become\r\ntransfigured; even the light of the sun is softer and more blessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the goddess of Atvatabar,\" I replied, \"has become more delicate,\r\nmore supernatural, and more holy.\"\r\n\r\nThe island was one vast garden of tropical fruits and flowers, without\r\nthe malaria of decay. Everywhere nature, carefully assisted by art,\r\nassumed the rarest beauty. Everything that savored of ruin and decay\r\nwas non-existent. There were no wild or poisonous animals. No deadly\r\nserpent was coiled upon the branches, nor did poisonous insects crawl\r\non leaf or flower. Forests of trees of a strange tropical vegetation\r\nabounded. There were the fruha, resembling dates; the caspariba,\r\nresembling bananas; the dulra, resembling limes; the jackle,\r\nresembling lemons; the congol, resembling oranges; the velicac,\r\nresembling bread-fruits; the persar, resembling custard apples; the\r\nphyorbal, resembling cocoanuts; the gersin, resembling mangosteens;\r\nthe huflar, resembling coffee; the solru, resembling plums; and\r\npresuveet, or tamarinds lining the route. Fruits such as the troupac,\r\nor citron; dewan, or guava; orogor, or mango; and ryeshmush, or\r\nplantain gleamed amid the embowering foliage, and gardens of squangs\r\nand the pineapples, aloes, nutmeg, cloves and spices of Atvatabar,\r\nwere on every hand.\r\n\r\nOne day, when floating on the lake, we heard with surprise and\r\ninfinite sadness the discharge of a gun, the signal that the island\r\nwas at an end. Spreading our wings, we awaited the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a roar of thunder startled us, and Arjeels, with its majestic\r\ncliffs, its green forests and rivers of flowers, fell in one\r\ndissolving crash, and faded from sight. The lake and boat fell from\r\nbeneath us so rapidly, that we would have fallen headlong into the sea\r\nhad not our wings saved us. There flowed where the island had stood a\r\ncircular wave rushing to a focus. There was an upward spouting pillar\r\nof foam, and all again was placid sea!\r\n\r\nWe flew downward to where the yacht awaited us, and alighting on\r\nboard, soon reached Mylosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nA REVELATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas for the brevity of earthly joys! The noble priests and\r\npriestesses had made a heroic effort to sustain Arjeels, but a month's\r\nincessant labors had quite exhausted their powers, and the glorious\r\nisland vanished, with all its ideal sweetness. As if to intensify our\r\nsadness, when we reached Egyplosis again, we found the high priest\r\nHushnoly, impatiently awaiting our return to secretly report the\r\nproceedings of a late council of the king and government, held in the\r\ncouncil chamber of Egyplosis.\r\n\r\nI knew by the appearance of Hushnoly that something unusual had\r\nhappened. He hesitated to unfold his secret until requested to do so\r\nby the goddess.\r\n\r\n\"It is a serious business,\" said Hushnoly, \"and I have been\r\ncommissioned by his majesty to know the full meaning of the step both\r\nyour holiness and his excellency are about to take, and see if there\r\nis no possibility of averting the terrible calamity, that overhangs\r\nEgyplosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Lyone to the high priest, \"what the council has been\r\ndiscussing, and what it has determined upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your holiness,\" said he, \"I should inform you that Koshnili, as chief\r\nminister of Atvatabar, has received a report from his winged spies,\r\ncharged with the duty of watching the movements of his excellency and\r\nretinue ever since their arrival in Atvatabar. His duty made it\r\nnecessary to discover the real object of the illustrious strangers in\r\nvisiting our country, and consequently their actions have been\r\ncarefully watched and reported.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of course,\" said I, \"my constant association with the supreme\r\ngoddess, has led Koshnili to suspect me of designs inimical to the\r\nwelfare of the kingdom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to the report made by Koshnili,\" replied Hushnoly, who\r\nunrolled a document he held in his hand, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_To His Majesty_, KING ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR, _of Atvatabar,\r\n     greeting_: Your faithful minister begs to report that his\r\n     private wayleals have followed his excellency, the alien\r\n     commander, Lexington White, and followers from their arrival\r\n     in Kioram until their reception at Egyplosis. The\r\n     illustrious strangers, after landing on our soil, travelled\r\n     by sacred locomotive from Kioram to Calnogor, and were there\r\n     the guests of your majesty, after which they attended a\r\n     feast of worship to the supreme goddess in the Bormidophia.\r\n     The illustrious strangers were then received by her holiness\r\n     in her palace of Tanje. While lingering here my wayleals,\r\n     from the ramparts of the palace, saw his excellency the\r\n     alien commander, in company with her holiness, enter the\r\n     silver pleasure boat. Their long-continued interview in the\r\n     palace garden testified that a mutual affinity had drawn the\r\n     illustrious personages together. From later observation my\r\n     faithful wayleals are convinced that in the palace garden of\r\n     Tanje was begun the awful possibility of a twin soul of our\r\n     deity, and the alien commander, and the consequent apostasy\r\n     of the supreme goddess, and her renunciation of Harikar.\r\n\r\n     \"My faithful wayleals further report that while travelling\r\n     on the aerial ship from Calnogor to Egyplosis, they obtained\r\n     further evidence of the consummation of a deific and alien\r\n     twin soul. The principals sat apart from all others, on a\r\n     seat at the prow of the vessel, and the report of their\r\n     conversation will justify your majesty in believing that a\r\n     sacrilegious twin soul already exists in defiance of civil\r\n     and religious law, her holiness and the alien commander\r\n     being the illustrious components.\r\n\r\n     \"Awaiting the further commands of your majesty, I remain,\r\n     with profound veneration,\r\n\r\n                   \"Your majesty's faithful servant,\r\n\r\n                                              \"KOSHNILI.\"\r\n\r\nI gasped for breath at hearing so brutal a dissection of our hearts. I\r\nwas thunderstruck. I could only ask Hushnoly what he had to say on the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"That you love each other, I need not ask,\" said he; \"that may be\r\ntaken for granted. But I might ask, do you each of you fully recognize\r\nthe position you stand in? Do you know that your conduct menaces the\r\nthrone of the gods itself? I can understand the violence of love for a\r\nhuman soul in the breast of the goddess, but what of her renunciation\r\nof Harikar?\"\r\n\r\n\"If not already convinced,\" I said, \"I think her holiness will soon\r\nsee that all this monstrous system of hopeless love is tottering on\r\nits throne. It is an artificial society, that must in time, of its own\r\naccord, crumble to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"His majesty,\" said the high priest, \"has departed with his retinue to\r\nCalnogor, and has called a council of the government to consider the\r\nsituation. He held that the rank of the individuals who have offended\r\nagainst the sacred code of Atvatabar, and the monstrous impiety of the\r\noffence itself, constitutes a subject worthy of the most serious\r\nconsideration of the government. His majesty was extremely angry on\r\nhearing the report of Koshnili. He characterized your excellency's\r\nconduct as unworthy of the hospitality you had received, and as\r\ninvolving the ruin of both the supreme goddess and yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Koshnili say when presenting the report?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Koshnili said that the affections of their beloved goddess had been\r\nwithdrawn from their only legitimate object, Harikar himself, and had\r\nbeen appropriated not even by a holy priest of the temple, not even by\r\nan ordinary citizen, but worse than all, by an infidel, a heathen, an\r\nadventurer and a stranger, emanating from some _terra incognita_ that\r\nmight, owing to the fatal discovery of Atvatabar, one day send its\r\nhordes to ravage the country with fire and sword. The council,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"knew the penalty for such treachery and abuse of\r\nhospitality on the part of a desperate and fanatical stranger, as well\r\nas such apostasy on the part of the goddess. He demanded the immediate\r\narrest of the guilty parties. The king had sufficient evidence to\r\nconvict and execute both individuals by reason of their high treason\r\nagainst both the government and faith of Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the king approve of Koshnili's demand?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"His majesty,\" said Hushnoly, \"said that a matter of such importance\r\nrequired the greatest circumspection. Her holiness was known to be the\r\nmost pious and popular supreme goddess that had ever sat on the throne\r\nof the gods, and although it was evident she had insulted Harikar,\r\nstill if the quiet expulsion of the strangers from Atvatabar soil\r\nwould prevent further disgrace of their faith and country, he would\r\nprefer to issue a decree of expulsion, rather than a decree for the\r\narrest of both commander and goddess. To reduce the possible calamity\r\nnow overhanging the nation to the least possible proportions, it would\r\nbe necessary to act at once, rather than to await the development of\r\nmore complete evidence of affection between the guilty parties.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Jolar deprecated the violent measures advocated by Koshnili,\r\nand supported the idea of the king, to quietly expel the strangers. He\r\nsaid that if the decree of expulsion were intrusted to him, he would\r\nsee that it was carried into effect without delay. The council could\r\nrely on the royal fleet doing its duty.\r\n\r\nKoshnili was angry at his idea of immediate arrest not being acted\r\nupon. \"Suppose these strangers,\" he said, \"refuse to leave, and being\r\nwarned by your royal mandate so fortify themselves by stirring up an\r\ninsurrection in favor of her holiness, that might possibly defeat the\r\nroyal arms, and, in the end, we ourselves be sacrificed by our present\r\ntimid vacillation. The crisis is a serious one and demands a desperate\r\nremedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Governor Ladalmir,\" said Hushnoly, \"rebutted the arguments of\r\nKoshnili. He pointed out that the laws of hospitality demanded that\r\nthe strangers should receive consideration at the hands of the king,\r\neven if guilty. They might receive fair warning to depart, after\r\nwhich, if the commander prove contumacious, more stringent measures\r\ncould be taken. Should the commander, in defiance of the royal\r\nmandate, endeavor to consolidate his affection for her holiness, doing\r\nfurther sacrilege to our faith, ecclesiastical law has the remedy of\r\ndeath for those who would dare dethrone our faith, and lead our\r\nbeloved goddess to take the irrevocable step of abandonment of her\r\nsupreme office. After considerable discussion, it was decided to act\r\non the suggestion of his majesty the king, that without bringing the\r\nmatter before the Borodemy, a decree of expulsion be handed Admiral\r\nJolar, for execution on the parties to be expelled from the kingdom.\r\nThe decree is already in the hands of Admiral Jolar for delivery to\r\nyour excellency.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nLYONE'S MANIFESTO TO KING AND PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask your holiness,\" said the high priest, \"if you will really\r\ntake so determined a step as that indicated by the action of the royal\r\ncouncil? The thought of such a thing strikes me dumb with fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hushnoly,\" said Lyone, \"I have ever found you faithful to my\r\ninterests, and I will now confide in you my purposes. You are a man of\r\nwisdom, calm and conservative, and can rest happy in the possession of\r\nyour counterpart soul. Your character has become moulded by your long\r\nnovitiate until you have become a part of the institution itself. To\r\nthink of any other state of things is to you an impossibility. On\r\nthousands of souls here, your inflexible laws have only developed a\r\nrebellious energy that will some day utterly destroy the fabric of\r\nEgyplosis. The true union of souls is not artificial restraint and the\r\npresent calmness is only the pause that preludes the explosion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you, supreme goddess, indeed desire to leave us forever? Will\r\nyou profane your holy office? Will you despoil the temple of ideal\r\nlove?\" said Hushnoly, with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"You think it monstrous,\" said Lyone, \"that I should desire to uproot\r\nprinciples so fixed and permanent. You can judge, then, how fierce\r\nmust be the passion that causes me to antagonize duty consecrated by\r\nthe ties and memories of my holy office.\"\r\n\r\n\"To break away from a responsibility so supreme,\" I said, \"argues\r\nalone an extraordinary force. Your very system creates just such a\r\nlove as this. Here souls are required to meet in rapture, and yet to\r\nstand balanced, as it were, on the thin edge of naked swords, and fall\r\nneither this way nor that. The development of a purely romantic love\r\neffeminates the race. The example of Egyplosis if carried out\r\nuniversally would obliterate the nation in one generation. The nation\r\nis wiser than its creed. Let us therefore choose the wiser path.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the dream of your noble parents,\" said Hushnoly to Lyone, \"to\r\nsee you supreme goddess of Egyplosis. When you obtained this peerless\r\nhonor they died. Your mother, dying, implored you to remember your\r\nvows, and to be ever true to your high office. 'Love only duty,' was\r\nher last sigh. If you love aught else, there is but a cruel death for\r\nyou, and your memory will be an everlasting disgrace. Will you, the\r\nideal of hopeless love, be the first to prove faithless?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say is true,\" I said, replying for Lyone, \"but what is duty?\r\nLyone not only owes a duty to her office, but also to herself. Her\r\nduty to herself is to rise up and break down this monstrous\r\nenvironment that chains down her soul, and her duty to these ten\r\nthousand souls is to tell them that an institution that constantly\r\nantagonizes nature is immoral. Here refined souls,\" I continued, \"seek\r\nthe cloister, not for peace, but for ecstatic anguish. They love and\r\nweep, and thus agitated they grow at once weak and violent, and can\r\nnever accommodate themselves to the serious purposes of life. Thus\r\nsacrificed on the altar of a false god, weary of a life of barren\r\nblessedness, you will discover, if you but seriously inquire into it,\r\nthat this palace is purely a prison for thousands of noble souls.\"\r\n\r\nAs I spoke, Hushnoly clasped his head with his hands and groaned.\r\n\"With the downfall of Egyplosis,\" he murmured, \"farewell delights,\r\nfarewell tendernesses, farewell mystical, chivalrous love!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not be so dejected,\" said Lyone; \"your imagination gives you but a\r\ncapricious view of the future, which will be even nobler than the\r\npast.\"\r\n\r\nThe high priest could hear no more, and left us seized with affright\r\nas to the future, and mourning the anticipated downfall of Egyplosis.\r\n\r\nLyone, far from exhibiting fear, grew enthusiastic over our projected\r\n_coup d'etat_, that would certainly, if successful, create an organic\r\nchange in the constitution of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe discussed the situation at length, and determined to leave\r\nEgyplosis for Calnogor forthwith.\r\n\r\nI could in some measure appreciate the struggle undergone by Lyone\r\nnecessary to sever her forever from so ineffable a retreat. But\r\npassion was stronger than environment, and it was duly announced that\r\nthe supreme goddess and the commander of the _Polar King_ and their\r\nimmediate followers would leave for Calnogor forthwith.\r\n\r\nOur departure from Egyplosis was attended with impressive ceremonies,\r\nour journey to Calnogor being made in the aerial ship of the goddess.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at Tanje we discovered that the king and government had\r\nheld their council unknown to the people. We did not think it\r\nexpedient either, just then, to make public the determination of the\r\ngoddess. I ordered my officers and sailors to Kioram forthwith to take\r\ncommand of the _Polar King_. My instructions to Captain Wallace were\r\nto have the ship fully supplied with stores, and remove her from the\r\nbasin where she lay into the outer harbor of Kioram, and there await\r\nfurther orders. After a considerable period of inactivity the ship's\r\ncompany were nothing loath to get on board again with the prospect of\r\nanother voyage. I confided to the officers the possibility of our\r\nbeing engaged in hostile operations, and ordered the ship to be put\r\nin fighting trim without delay. The officers and men were tendered the\r\ndignity of riding to Kioram in the sacred locomotive, and their\r\ndeparture was made amid the enthusiasm of the populace.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I remained at the palace of Tanje, the residence of the\r\ngoddess, to assist Lyone in preparing her manifesto to the people.\r\n\r\nIt was a painful crisis for her, who was the symbol of ideal love, to\r\nbe the first to renounce its delights for the sake of an every-day\r\nunion with a beloved soul.\r\n\r\nFor days her decision trembled in the balance. Her avowal of being led\r\ncaptive by human love would be a national catastrophe. She trembled\r\nfor her ten thousand devotees in Egyplosis. It seemed a cruel and\r\nheartless trampling under foot of throbbing hearts that were thrilling\r\nwith faith in their goddess. When I saw Lyone prepared to abandon\r\nEgyplosis for my sake, when I knew she would forever resign that\r\nsplendid throne swept by whirlwinds of adoration, for the sake of\r\nbeing clasped to my heart, when I saw her risk even life itself for\r\nthe simple love of one adoring heart, I then knew what love really\r\nwas. It was, as Dante says,\r\n\r\n    \"Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,\r\n     Exhaustless riches and unmeasured bliss.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the decision was made. Lyone had decided that the ideal love\r\nof Egyplosis was only suited to disembodied spirits, and not for those\r\nbreathing elements of matter that are unable to exist in the spiritual\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe following was the text of her manifesto to the king, Borodemy and\r\npeople:\r\n\r\n        \"_The Avowal of_ LYONE, _Supreme Goddess of Atvatabar, Holy\r\n          Ruler of the palaces, Supernal and Infernal, of Egyplosis,\r\n          Queen of Magicians, Mother of Sorcerers, Princess of\r\n          Arjeels, etc., etc., to His Most Excellent Majesty_ KING\r\n          ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR _and the People of Atvatabar_.\r\n\r\n     \"The supreme goddess presents her respectful salutations,\r\n     and desires to inform his majesty the king and the people\r\n     that her ardent soul, sensitive to the tender feelings of\r\n     human affection, desires to live no longer without a\r\n     counterpart soul. The love of ten thousand souls does not\r\n     satisfy the craving for the love of but one soul. She has\r\n     been told to love Harikar the unseen. She reaches out her\r\n     lips, but they do not meet with love's delirious kisses. Her\r\n     heart, withering within her because of soul loneliness, has\r\n     taught her to seek liberty, to love the soul of her choice.\r\n\r\n     \"She resigns her seat on the throne of the gods, as goddess,\r\n     having discovered her counterpart soul.\r\n\r\n     \"She hopes that reform and not destruction will guide the\r\n     king and his ministers in dealing with Egyplosis at this\r\n     crisis.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at her palace of Tanje in this, the eleventh year of\r\n     her deification as supreme goddess.\r\n\r\n                                                     LYONE.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorial fell upon the people like a shell of terrorite. No one\r\nhad ever suspected the crisis was so real. The king had lulled himself\r\nwith the belief that, as my sailors had already departed to embark on\r\nthe _Polar King_, I would possibly quietly follow them, and leave the\r\ncountry without his having the trouble of even asking me to go. The\r\nmessage of the goddess, however, opened his eyes to the true state of\r\nthings, and I forthwith received the following decree from his\r\nmajesty, at the hands of Jolar, admiral of the royal fleet:\r\n\r\n         \"ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR, _King of Atvatabar, to His Excellency\r\n          Lexington White, Commander of the ship Polar King, etc.,\r\n          etc., greeting_:\r\n\r\n     \"It having come to our knowledge that you, the said\r\n     Lexington White, have conceived an affection for the sacred\r\n     person of our illustrious supreme goddess, Lyone, spouse of\r\n     Harikar, holy ruler of Egyplosis, mother of sorcerers, etc.,\r\n     in defiance of our holy faith and laws of this our realm,\r\n     and furthermore it having come to our knowledge that the\r\n     said supreme goddess has so far forgotten her holy duty as\r\n     to reciprocate your affection, be it known to you that the\r\n     penalty prescribed by the laws of this our realm for your\r\n     heinous offence (which is sacrilegious treason) is death by\r\n     magnicity, for both guilty persons.\r\n\r\n     \"To inform you of the law and the penalty for your crime,\r\n     and to give you an opportunity of renouncing your affection\r\n     for our supreme goddess, and for your immediate departure\r\n     from the soil of Atvatabar, we send you this our decree,\r\n     commanding you as follows: That you forthwith renounce your\r\n     treasonable affection, love and interest in the personality\r\n     of said supreme goddess. That you embark, together with your\r\n     officers and seamen, on board your ship, the _Polar King_,\r\n     within one week from date hereof, and forever leave our\r\n     realm of Atvatabar and the surrounding seas thereof. You\r\n     must not again return to this our realm in any manner\r\n     whatsoever, or send messengers, or correspond or conspire\r\n     with any inhabitant thereof, particularly with our said\r\n     supreme goddess, under penalty of death, both for yourself\r\n     and for your entire crew.\r\n\r\n     \"Given at our palace in Calnogor, in this fifty-sixth year\r\n     of our reign.\r\n\r\n                                      \"ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR,\r\n\r\n                                          \"_King of Atvatabar_.\"\r\n\r\nI received the document from the hands of the admiral with deep\r\nrespect, and requested him to assure his majesty King Aldemegry\r\nBhoolmakar of my profound regard and deep gratitude for the hospitable\r\nreception we had received from his majesty and his people during our\r\nstay in the glorious kingdom of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nI stated that we were at present in the act of leaving their country\r\non a voyage of further discovery, but could not say that we would not\r\nagain return to Atvatabar. We should be most happy to obey the command\r\nof the king, but should we receive a message to return from the\r\nsupreme goddess ere we left the interior world, we might possibly\r\nreturn, notwithstanding the royal command, and brave the wrath of his\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the admiral, \"it would be my duty to prevent you\r\nfrom landing on Atvatabar soil; and should you succeed in eluding the\r\nvigilance of the fleet, your apprehension and that of your people by\r\nhis majesty's wayleals would mean the execution of your entire party.\r\nWe are a proud nation, and our army and navy are invincible.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked the admiral for his well-meant warning, whereupon he\r\nwithdrew from the palace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE CRISIS IN ATVATABAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manifesto of Lyone had precipitated an historic crisis in\r\nAtvatabar. The king awaited my leaving the country with the utmost\r\nimpatience. He made every effort to prevent the news from reaching the\r\npublic, hoping that when I took my departure the goddess would be\r\namenable to the laws of the realm, and the faith be thus preserved.\r\n\r\nThe more that Lyone and myself discussed the situation, the more\r\napparent it appeared that we could not now draw back from the position\r\nwe had taken. It was absolutely necessary to provide a following in\r\ncase the government attempted arrest, or the execution of either or\r\nboth of us. Trusty messengers were despatched to the high priest,\r\nHushnoly, the grand sorcerer, Charka, the lord of art, Yermoul, and\r\nthe other friends of Lyone, informing them of the step she had taken,\r\nand asking their support in case any violence were offered her.\r\n\r\nI advised Lyone to have her agents collect and transmit to Kioram all\r\nmunitions of war. Some of the royal wayleals were armed with spears,\r\nand others with swords and shields. All battles were fought in the\r\nair, by reason of the wayleals being able to fly, as their movement on\r\nwings was more rapid than movement on foot.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the ordinary spear of the king's wayleals was very\r\neffective, by reason of its discharging a magnetic current into the\r\nbody, causing instant death. With a view of arming the army of the\r\ngoddess with a more potent weapon than magnic spears, I quietly had\r\nagents purchase for immediate transmission to Kioram vast quantities\r\nof iron, and the material for making gunpowder, which happily existed\r\nin great abundance in Atvatabar. My idea was to start a manufactory\r\nfor firearms, which were unknown to the interior world, and arm every\r\nman with a magazine rifle--a portable mitrailleuse, in fact.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in discussing the plan of defence with Lyone the crisis\r\nwas precipitated by the press of the country finding out the _coup\r\nd'etat_ of the goddess. With a view of placing the government in the\r\nmost favorable light before the people, the chief organ of the king,\r\n_The Calnogor Jossidi_, published a fierce editorial condemning the\r\naction of the goddess, and reviling what it was pleased to call \"the\r\ncontumacious invader and despoiler of Atvatabar.\" The article ran\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n                 \"IMPIOUS SACRILEGE!\r\n                \"ASTOUNDING APOSTASY!\r\n   \"THE SUPREME GODDESS REFUSES FURTHER WORSHIP, AND HAS\r\n       DEGRADED HERSELF BY SEEKING MARRIAGE WITH AN\r\n                     ALIEN LOVER!\r\n       \"WHAT IS FAITH, IF DECEIT BE OUR DEITY?\r\n\r\n     \"The sweet, the noble, the pure, the exalted worship of holy\r\n     love, and of its hitherto most perfect symbol, the Goddess\r\n     Lyone, is threatened with extinction, if it be not entirely\r\n     destroyed. That sweet and perishable affection that fills\r\n     the breasts of lovers, which has been for ages conserved,\r\n     expanded, and wrought into an enduring fabric of religion in\r\n     the sacred temple of Egyplosis, is about to utterly perish\r\n     by a mad act of apostasy on the part of the deity herself.\r\n     Whither now will tender and faithful hearts turn to find a\r\n     refuge for all that makes the life glorious? Our ideal soul\r\n     has sunk into degradation! She has flung herself from her\r\n     proud and happy throne, wounding our faith with impious\r\n     sacrilege!\r\n\r\n     \"Never before in the history of the world has the treachery\r\n     of a goddess been manifest; we have had occasion hitherto\r\n     only to mourn the apostasy of the worshipper. Now what\r\n     avails our worship, if the object of our adoration fails us\r\n     in the hour of need? Who is to console the bereavement of\r\n     millions, when their consoler has hopelessly abandoned them?\r\n     We say to both his majesty the king and government, follow\r\n     the iconoclasts with the sword of justice; no punishment is\r\n     too severe for such perfidious workers of iniquity! Death on\r\n     the magnic scaffold is the penalty for the infatuation of\r\n     the goddess and her atheistic lover! Wanting both men and\r\n     money, the standard of revolt will be brought down by the\r\n     first blow, and his majesty's troops can be relied upon to\r\n     bring the rebels to swift justice. Let them be covered with\r\n     eternal infamy who will support this fearful apostasy!\"\r\n\r\nIt became necessary for Lyone to publish the following manifesto to\r\nthe nation, stating briefly the reasons that led to her renunciation\r\nof Harikar, to become the apostle of a new creed of one body and one\r\nsoul:\r\n\r\n     \"LYONE, _who has been until now Supreme Goddess of the faith\r\n     of Harikar, to her faithful people, greeting_:\r\n\r\n     \"I, who have been exalted to the high seat of honor on the\r\n     throne of the gods, as the incarnation of the supreme soul,\r\n     having received divine honors at your hands, desire at this\r\n     crisis to make known to you the nature of the reform I seek\r\n     to establish in the faith and worship of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not seek to annihilate your faith, with all its tender\r\n     and memorable qualities. I simply seek to reform such\r\n     religion, making it more natural, more holy. All things that\r\n     exist do change; if they do not rise to greater glory, they\r\n     must sink to profounder shame. I, who have been your goddess\r\n     during a long and blessed Nirvana, know how much you love\r\n     me. I know that round my throne a tempest of passion has\r\n     swept for years, filling me with its ecstasy. But I hasten\r\n     to tell you that the delights of Egyplosis have been\r\n     purchased at a fearful price. The sacrifices of its priests\r\n     and priestesses have proved to me that even the retreat of\r\n     ideal love can be as inexorably cruel as the outer world. So\r\n     harassing have been these sacrifices that some could not\r\n     bear their burden, and at this moment five hundred twin\r\n     souls are confined in the dungeons of Egyplosis because they\r\n     transgressed the vows of their novitiate. Of what avail are\r\n     tender, chivalrous delights, if nature, if reason, be\r\n     outraged in producing them?\r\n\r\n     \"Those who have remained steadfast to their vows, have grown\r\n     sickly and morbid, feeding too long on fantastic ecstasies.\r\n     Despondent and unreal in mind, delicate and nervous in body,\r\n     they only appear rich and radiant in some brief ceremonial,\r\n     while their every-day life is shuddering, tearful, and\r\n     unstable, and utterly unfit to cope with the struggle of\r\n     ordinary existence.\r\n\r\n     \"Therefore it is that one moment of pleasure is purchased by\r\n     whole days of pain, and the oscillation between such\r\n     extremes racks and ruins the dearest souls.\r\n\r\n     \"The motto of the new faith for Egyplosis, 'One Body and One\r\n     Soul,' founded on the ordinary marriage rite, will restore\r\n     to priest and priestess the steady and temperate possession\r\n     of their souls which gives society that virile force\r\n     necessary to its very existence.\r\n\r\n     \"By the memory of our mutual love, I claim the support of my\r\n     faithful priests and priestesses, worshippers and people, in\r\n     the coming struggle.\r\n\r\n                                                         \"LYONE.\"\r\n\r\nThe manifesto of the goddess, published in all the papers of the\r\nkingdom, created a profound sensation. It was the first discovery to\r\nmillions that their religion had been weighed and found wanting.\r\nAlthough many were aware of its excesses, they saw that, despite every\r\nregulation, the hornet was in possession of Hesperides, prepared to\r\nsting the hand that reached for the golden fruit.\r\n\r\nThey learned that passion led to agonized exaltation, and that the\r\nmoral fibres of the soul became paralyzed by fierce temptation and\r\ninordinate spiritual delights. They saw that restraint of rapture and\r\na more natural basis for the fellowship of the sexes were reforms\r\nimperatively needed, if the religion of Atvatabar were to remain an\r\nelevating and purifying force. Their creed must be reformed, both in\r\nfaith and practice, and who so capable of introducing such a reform as\r\nLyone herself?\r\n\r\nThe power of the deep-rooted conservatism of those who had nothing to\r\ngain by the change, the fear of the merchants that civil war meant\r\ntheir financial ruin, of a king jealous of his authority, and of the\r\nsupremacy of existing laws, were the forces that would oppose the\r\npower of the goddess to carry out her reforms.\r\n\r\nI began to accuse myself of being entirely responsible for all this\r\ndisturbance in a peaceful country. Had I never discovered Atvatabar,\r\nLyone might never have desired to disturb the existing order of\r\nthings, but would have remained an agonized and crowned goddess,\r\nwedded only to Harikar, in a temple of eternal celibacy.\r\n\r\nI knew, however, that all this was changed. I knew it by her sighs at\r\nour first meeting in the garden of Tanje, which, to remember, again\r\nand again made me thrill and shudder with joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nMY DEPARTURE FROM THE PALACE OF TANJE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe week of grace allowed me to leave Atvatabar had already expired\r\nere it had seriously occurred to me to actually leave the palace. The\r\ncommotion in the nation consequent on the publication of the manifesto\r\nof king and goddess was so great, and the necessity of advising Lyone\r\nin the crisis so urgent, that I did not take leave of her until the\r\ntime for my departure was exhausted. One thing that made me somewhat\r\ncareless of arousing the royal danger was that the _Polar King_ with\r\nher terrorite guns could command Kioram in spite of the royal fleet,\r\nalthough it numbered one hundred vessels. Fortunately the royal fleet\r\nhad not yet learned the use of gunpowder, their guns being discharged\r\nwith compressed air.\r\n\r\nA despatch from Captain Wallace stated that the ship was lying in the\r\nouter harbor, well equipped either for a long voyage or probable\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nWith the view of allaying the excitement of the people, the king\r\npublished a statement that the alien commander and his retinue had\r\nbeen ordered to leave forthwith. As for Lyone, the crisis had in no\r\nwise terrified her; she felt assured, however, that \"the beginning of\r\nthe end had come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not afraid of lifelong imprisonment or death in case your\r\ncause has no supporters?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"They can do me no harm,\" she replied, \"for the entire priesthood of\r\nEgyplosis, the Art Palace of Gnaphisthasia, and thousands of\r\nsympathizers among the people themselves, will rally to my flag when\r\nthe hour of danger comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can depend on my operations at sea,\" said I, \"in your behalf.\r\nAlthough I have but a single vessel, I will fight the entire fleet of\r\nAtvatabar. One shell of terrorite has more power than a thousand of\r\ntheir guns. I will destroy Kioram, if need be, to bring the king to\r\nsubmission.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Lyone, I drew up a plan of campaign for the coming\r\nstruggle. Hushnoly, the high priest, although conservative as regards\r\nthe affairs of the priesthood, was really a trusty friend of the\r\ngoddess, and would assist the grand sorcerer in commanding a wing of\r\nthe sacred army.\r\n\r\nThe liberated priests and priestesses would fight like lions for the\r\ncause for which they had been imprisoned. The palace of Gnaphisthasia\r\nwould also furnish its battalions, led by Yermoul, lord of art. Then,\r\namong the fifty millions of people there were perhaps twenty millions\r\nin favor of reform, who would contribute a large army in support of\r\nLyone.\r\n\r\n\"It is by no means certain that a civil war will take place, even to\r\nsecure the proposed reform,\" said Lyone. \"The people may leave it to\r\nthe Borodemy and the law to settle the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what would be the result in such a case?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I persisted in my demands, and no insurrection took place,\"\r\nsaid Lyone, \"the king might put me to death as the simplest way of\r\nending the matter, and appoint another goddess in Egyplosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will never hurt a hair of your head while I live: I swear it!\"\r\nsaid I, with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\nLyone smiled at my enthusiasm, and refused to permit me to linger\r\nlonger with her. We understood each other perfectly. I saw that when\r\nLyone had once made up her mind on a certain course, there could be no\r\nretreat. She cared not any longer for a dead throne, for even the\r\nworship of the multitude could not feed her famished heart. She must\r\nhave a beloved soul, consecrated to herself alone, between whom would\r\nvibrate the music of great thoughts and tender emotions.\r\n\r\nLyone had declared war upon hopeless love. This was a necessary\r\nconsequence of her altered position. Egyplosis, founded on a brilliant\r\ntheory, had in practice become a prison, and she must open the doors\r\nto let its prisoners free.\r\n\r\nJust as I was leaving the palace I received a message from Hushnoly\r\nstating that the king had secretly ordered my arrest, and to be\r\ncircumspect if I wished to reach Kioram free.\r\n\r\nAttended by a guard of bockhockids faithful to Lyone I set out for\r\nKioram, taking a circuitous road to avoid Calnogor. I had been\r\ninformed by Hushnoly that mobs of excited and bloodthirsty wayleals\r\nwere flying about the metropolis, shouting \"Death to the foreigners!\"\r\nMounted on a magnificent, majestic steed of great power, I led my\r\nlittle band at a furious pace. The bockhockids with each stride of the\r\nleg covered a distance of sixty feet, and could travel easily seventy\r\nmiles an hour without appearing to run very quickly.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour's travelling brought us abreast of Calnogor, and soon\r\nafterward I heard shots fired and the noise of a conflict. Making an\r\naerial _detour_, I discovered a combat between a dozen wayleals on the\r\none side and a crowd of wayleals on the other. I noticed that as fast\r\nas the individuals of the larger body were fired at by a weapon in the\r\nhands of the smaller company they at once became lifeless, either\r\nfalling to the ground or hanging limp in the air supported by their\r\nstill vibrating wings. Being intensely curious to see the wayleals\r\nusing revolvers, I ventured with my men nearer the _melee_, and coming\r\nnear the flying warriors, I discovered to my surprise and horror that\r\nthe smaller band of flying men was a company of my own sailors, led by\r\nFlathootly, fighting back to back a swarming mass of wayleals.\r\n\r\nThe brave fellows fought like lions. No sooner did a wayleal approach\r\na sailor with his deadly spear than he was shot. My men, fighting such\r\nfearful odds, for the enemy numbered several hundreds, could not long\r\nmaintain so unequal a combat, notwithstanding the superiority of their\r\nweapons. It was only a question of time when their ammunition would be\r\nexhausted, and their spears would then be their only weapon, and I had\r\nevidently arrived in time to relieve them. Flathootly was shouting to\r\nthe enemy, \"Shtand back, or Oi'll shoot yez!\" when I approached. The\r\nsailors cheered to see me flying to their relief, and at that moment\r\nthe enemy, recognizing in me the very man they wanted, swarmed around\r\nto prevent my escape. My bockhockids drew their spears, and the\r\nsailors used their revolvers freely, and forming a flying ring,\r\neffectually protected me from the onslaught of the king's wayleals. I\r\nrallied my entire company, who received the rush of the wayleals with\r\na discharge of revolvers and magnic spears, by means of which we\r\nkilled several. Again and again the enemy fell upon us with renewed\r\nfury, shouting their war-cry of \"Bhoolmakar!\" They evidently meant to\r\nharass us until re-enforced by a detachment of the royal troops strong\r\nenough to capture us.\r\n\r\nA wayleal, in an unguarded moment, struck me on the shoulder,\r\nfortunately with only one point of his spear, drawing blood.\r\nFlathootly, who saw the blow, emptied his revolver in his breast, and\r\nhe fell to earth a dead man. I was surprised that the enemy had not\r\nalready annihilated my men, for, notwithstanding their fear of the\r\nsailors' revolvers, three of the sailors had been killed. It was\r\nterrible news to think of my brave fellows being slaughtered, but I\r\nwas determined to have revenge. I singled out Gossody, the leader of\r\nthe wayleals, and rushing forward on my bockhockid, aimed at his head\r\nwith my revolver, and instantly killed him. The death of their leader\r\nparalyzed the wayleals for a time. Before they could recover from\r\ntheir surprise, we killed a number of them. The enemy, once more\r\nrallying, made a fresh attack. They hoped to either kill or capture us\r\nby sheer force of superior numbers. We killed dozens of them, but at a\r\nfearful cost. Six of the bockhockids and three more of our own sailors\r\nbit the dust. It was quite evident that it would be only a question of\r\ntime before we would be completely annihilated. I saw that it was\r\nnecessary for us to reach Kioram without further fighting. We could\r\nnot afford to risk the life of another man, even to gain a complete\r\nvictory. I therefore ordered a flying retreat. The bockhockids were\r\narranged in a circle, in the midst of which flew our sailors. We\r\nstruck out for Kioram with the speed of the wind, pursued by an\r\never-increasing horde of wayleals thirsting for our blood. Such was\r\nour speed of motion that the thrusts of the enemy were ineffectual. It\r\nwas a magnificent sight to see the giant machines, like flying cranes,\r\ndevouring distance with their wings, each ridden by a winged warrior.\r\nWearied and exhausted with our fight, and still longer period of\r\nflight, it was a welcome sight to see beneath us the city of Kioram,\r\nand the _Polar King_ riding at anchor in the outer harbor, beyond\r\nwhich lay the royal navy of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nWhen within sight of the city the enemy unexpectedly gave up the\r\nchase, and did not follow us further. We soon gained the ship, and in\r\na short time our bockhockids decorated the masts and rigging. The\r\nstory of my imprisonment and the massacre of the six sailors of the\r\nforce sent to escort me to Kioram was soon told, and a more determined\r\ncrew never trod the deck of ship of war. We would teach Bhoolmakar a\r\nlesson he would never forget!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nWE ARE ATTACKED BY THE ENEMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Wallace and the entire ship's company were overjoyed at my\r\nescape from the clutches of the enemy. The loss of six of our brave\r\nsailors was a terrible calamity in any case, but still more so in view\r\nof the impending attack by the enemy's navy.\r\n\r\nWe had a good stock of gunpowder on board, and the ship's mechanics\r\nunder Professor Rackiron began the construction of a series of machine\r\nguns, each weapon having one hundred rifled barrels arranged in\r\ncircles around the central tube. Twenty-five of these guns were\r\nconstructed. To each tube was fitted a magazine, with automatic\r\nattachment, so that one man could handle each weapon, that would throw\r\nfive hundred balls with each charge of the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe fletyemings of the royal navy possessed the advantage of numbers\r\nand ships, so that it was necessary for us to have the advantage in\r\npoint of arms. Our monster terrorite gun and the terrorite battery\r\ngave us also an immense advantage over the gunpowder batteries of the\r\nenemy. Thus equipped, we were more than a match for any ten ships of\r\nthe enemy. But when we saw one hundred vessels, the smallest of which\r\nwas as large as our own, and many twice our size, bearing down upon us\r\nin battle array, we felt our chances of escape, not to mention\r\nvictory, were hardly worth calculating.\r\n\r\nIt was a splendid scene for a naval battle. The harbor of Kioram was a\r\nbay fully fifty miles in diameter, and here lay the royal fleet, whose\r\nhulls of gleaming gold shone on the blue water, while beyond rose the\r\nbrilliant whiteness of the sculptured city.\r\n\r\nCaptain Wallace had the ship ready for action. Every soul knew it was\r\na life-and-death struggle. The sailors knew that success meant wealth\r\nbeyond the dreams of avarice. For myself, the prize was something more\r\nworthy of our desperate courage--it was the priceless Lyone, possessed\r\nof a divine personality. Her life, like my own, hung in the balance.\r\nShould I win the battle, we would win each other. Should I fail to\r\nconquer, there was but one kind of defeat, and that was death.\r\n\r\nEvery man stood at his post in silence. Flathootly had command of a\r\ncompany of sailors. Professor Rackiron superintended our chief arm of\r\ndefence, the terrorite guns--weapons, like our revolvers, fortunately\r\nunknown in Atvatabar. We had a large quantity of explosive terrorite\r\non board, in the shape of shells for our guns. The shells contained\r\neach the equivalent of 100 pounds of terrorite--that is to say, they\r\nwould each weigh 100 pounds on the outer earth, while the shells of\r\nthe giant gun weighed 250 pounds each. The iron hurricane-deck, that\r\ndid us such service in the polar climate, was put up overhead, as a\r\nprotection from the onslaught of a boarding crew.\r\n\r\nThe ships of the enemy advanced proudly in a double line of battle. On\r\nthe peak of each floated the ensign of Atvatabar, a red sun surrounded\r\nby a wide circle of green, on a blue field.\r\n\r\nOn the _Polar King_ floated the flag of the goddess, a figure of the\r\nthrone of the gods in gold, on a purple ground.\r\n\r\nWhen but a mile off, we could see the guns on every ship pointed and\r\nready for the attack. The enemy suddenly broke into the form of a\r\nsemi-circle. It was the design of Admiral Jolar to surround us and\r\ncapture or destroy the _Polar King_ by sheer force of numbers. We\r\nallowed the formation to proceed, until the entire navy of Atvatabar\r\nsurrounded us in an enormous circle.\r\n\r\nHaving executed this manoeuvre, a boat put away from the admiral's\r\nship and approached us. In a short time it reached our vessel, and the\r\ncaptain of the admiral's ship, with several officers, came on board.\r\n\r\nThe captain demanded my unconditional surrender, \"in the name of his\r\nmajesty King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar of Atvatabar.\" I had been declared\r\n\"an enemy of the country, a violator of its most sacred laws, a\r\nheretic in active destruction of its holy faith, and a fugitive from\r\njustice.\" The captain, as the emissary of the admiral, demanded the\r\nimmediate surrender of myself and entire company.\r\n\r\nI asked my men if they were prepared to surrender themselves to the\r\nenemy. Their fearful shout of \"Never!\" disturbed the silence of the\r\nsea, and must have been heard by the distant enemy.\r\n\r\n\"You hear the reply of my men,\" I said to the captain. \"Tell your\r\nadmiral that the commander of the _Polar King_ declines to\r\nsurrender.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the captain, \"we will open fire upon you at once. We mean\r\nto have you dead or alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give the admiral my compliments,\" said I, \"and tell him to open the\r\nfight as soon as he likes.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain and his staff rapidly disappeared, and we knew that the\r\nfight was certain. The officers had no sooner reached the admiral's\r\nship than a report was heard; and a ball of metal crashed upon the\r\nhurricane-deck overhead, tearing a large hole in it, and then plunged\r\ninto the sea. This was the signal of war. Before we could reply, the\r\n_Polar King_ was the target of a general bombardment from all points\r\nof the compass. The balls that struck us were of different kinds of\r\nmetal--lead, zinc, iron, and even gold. Although the range of their\r\nguns was accurate, yet, owing to the loss of gravity, the shots had\r\nbut little effect on the plating of the vessel. Some of the sailors\r\nwere severely wounded by being struck in the limbs with the large\r\nmissiles hurled upon us, and I saw that if the enemy couldn't sink the\r\n_Polar King_ they could at least kill us, which was even worse.\r\n\r\nI gave orders to Professor Rackiron to train the giant gun on the\r\nadmiral's vessel. The discharge was accompanied by a slight flash,\r\nwithout smoke, and we saw the deadly messenger make its aerial flight\r\nstraight toward the admiral's vessel. It entered the water right in\r\nfront of the ship, and in another instant an extraordinary scene was\r\nwitnessed. The ship, in company with a vast volume of water, sprang\r\ninto the air to a great height, with an immense hole blown in the\r\nbottom of the hull. Falling again, she sank with all of the crew who\r\ndid not manage to fly clear of her rigging. After the vessel\r\ndisappeared, the last of the waterspout fell upon the boiling sea.\r\n\r\nIt was a great surprise to the enemy to see their best ship destroyed\r\nat a single blow. The effect of our shot completely paralyzed the foe\r\nfor the moment, for every vessel ceased firing at us. At first it was\r\nthought that the admiral had gone down with his vessel, and until a\r\nnew admiral was in command the battle would be suspended.\r\n\r\nDuring the confusion we ran the _Polar King_ through the breach made\r\nin the circle of the enemy, keeping his ships on one side of us. I\r\ndetermined to try the tactics of rapid movement, with the steady\r\ndischarge of the terrorite gun, hoping to destroy a ship at every\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHIP IN COMPANY WITH A VAST VOLUME OF WATER SPRANG\r\nINTO THE AIR TO A GREAT HEIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that Admiral Jolar was still alive, he having escaped\r\nfrom his ship in mid air, with his staff and a number of fletyemings,\r\nby means of their electric wings. He had alighted on the ship of the\r\nrear admiral, where he hoisted the pennant of the admiral.\r\n\r\nThe enemy was now thoroughly alive to the necessity of destroying or\r\ncapturing us. I saw it was a mistake in allowing ourselves to be\r\nsurrounded in a bay only fifty miles wide. To fight so many ships\r\nrequired ample sea-room, to avoid the possibility of being captured.\r\n\r\nThe admiral sent ten ships to guard the mouth of the bay. It was a\r\nsatisfaction to know that the torpedo was also unknown in Atvatabar,\r\nelse our career would have been cut short. The _Polar King_, running\r\ntwenty-five miles an hour, was followed by the enemy's fleet, which,\r\nalthough slower in movement, had the advantage in numbers and could\r\npossibly drive us upon the shore. After sailing as far east as we\r\ncared to go, the _Polar King_ lay to, awaiting a renewal of the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal fleet formed a wide semi-circle a mile off, and reopened its\r\nguns upon us. An unlucky shot struck one of our seamen and cut off his\r\nhead. A perfect storm of shot rained upon us, so destroying our\r\nhurricane-deck that it was no longer of any protection to us. The\r\nenemy, encouraged by their success, closed in upon us. What we feared\r\nmost of all was an attack by the wing-jackets, against whom neither\r\nour heavy guns nor superior speed would much avail.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rackiron aimed the giant gun right in the centre of the\r\nenemy's line of battle. The shell struck the middle ship and exploded.\r\nAll three vessels were scattered half a mile apart, and made complete\r\nwrecks. The _Polar King_ darted forward to pass through the breach\r\nmade in the enemy's line. We found this a matter of difficulty, for\r\nthe enemy, seeing our move, closed the gap in front of us. The ships\r\nahead would have barred the way, but to prevent their doing so, we\r\nthrew a shell of terrorite over the bow of the ship into the water.\r\nThe sea rose on either side fully half a mile into the air, in solid\r\npillars of water. In the confusion, we burst through the ranks of the\r\nenemy and were once more in open water.\r\n\r\nThe admiral must have been exasperated at our escape. He followed us\r\nas before, in close rank, firing as he came. We now saw that he was\r\nabout to change his mode of attack, for, hovering in the air, a\r\nrapidly-growing swarm of fletyemings were preparing to give us a\r\nhand-to-hand combat. Each vessel furnished a certain contingent to the\r\nattacking force, until the aerial battalion numbered about five\r\nthousand men. Our position seemed hopeless. What could less than\r\neighty men do against a host of ten thousand? At close quarters our\r\nterrorite guns would be useless.\r\n\r\nWith loud yells the fletyemings swept down upon us. Fearing our guns,\r\nthey kept open rank and spread around the ship. Aiming at the densest\r\npart of the enemy, we destroyed about five hundred of them, but,\r\nquickly rallying again, they were upon us.\r\n\r\nWe were ready for them. Our battery of twelve terrorite guns,\r\nincluding the magazine guns and musketry, rang out a terrible\r\ndischarge. Under the withering fire and fearful explosions our foes\r\nfell back, and the sea around was strewn with dead and wounded bodies.\r\nLuckily for us, the only weapons possessed by the enemy were their\r\nmagnic spears. The wing-jackets, rallying again, swarmed upon the\r\nrigging and covered the ship like a cloud of vultures. Ere we could\r\nagain discharge our guns, several of our men were beaten down by sheer\r\nforce of numbers. They made splendid use of their deadly spears. The\r\nship's crew, re-attacked between the discharges of the guns, were many\r\nof them stunned and killed--the enemy after each discharge renewing\r\nthe attack, being constantly re-enforced from the fleet. It was\r\npossible that we would be conquered by the fearful odds against us.\r\n\r\nOur ability to keep up a fire from our guns grew more and more\r\ndifficult, owing to the incessant attacks of the enemy and the vast\r\naccumulation of their dead bodies on deck. The spears of our foes were\r\nmore formidable weapons than we had supposed, for their touch was\r\ndeath. It was evident, notwithstanding the carnage, that our men would\r\nbe obliged to surrender, owing to sheer exhaustion. As soon as a\r\nwing-jacket dropped from the ranks of the enemy another took his\r\nplace; our guns covered the sea with their dead bodies. The admiral\r\nwas determined to conquer us at any cost, for he rightly surmised our\r\nvictory would be a terrible blow to Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nTo remove ourselves as far from the fleet as possible, I directed the\r\nship at full speed ahead for the outer water. The ten ships that lay\r\nacross the entrance to the harbor would have to be destroyed,\r\nnotwithstanding the ceaseless attack of the fletyemings, who followed\r\nour every movement. We acted solely on the defensive, and managed,\r\nwhile repelling the most furious onslaughts, to throw overboard the\r\ndead bodies of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of constant fighting we managed to get the terrorite guns\r\ninto position again, and when within a mile of the blockade fired the\r\nentire battery into it. Our shells sank every vessel they struck and\r\nbroke several others from their moorings. Several more shots destroyed\r\nthe remaining vessels, but only leaving their crews like a swarm of\r\nhornets free to attack us, This, however, was a minor matter compared\r\nwith possessing the freedom of the outer sea. We rushed over the spot\r\nwhere the ships had been anchored, and soon left the pursuing fleet\r\nfar behind.\r\n\r\nThe wing-jackets, re-enforced by the crews of the blockading fleet,\r\nrenewed their attack. Having learned the terrible power of our\r\nmagazine guns, they contented themselves with making attacks on\r\nunguarded points. But fifty sailors were thus engaged, while the\r\nremainder of the ship's crew, including the officers, worked the guns\r\nwith a will, The revolvers of the enemy disabled us considerably, but\r\nby firing our magazine guns in every direction we kept the ranks of\r\nthe flying enemy pretty well thinned out.\r\n\r\nOur tactics were to keep the foe divided, if possible, and destroy the\r\nattacking force in detail. So long as the sailors could stand by their\r\nguns we were safe. We could outstrip the fleet in speed, thus reducing\r\nthe chances of our immediate antagonists being re-enforced, for those\r\nwho at first attacked us melted rapidly before the withering fire of\r\nour batteries.\r\n\r\nFinding themselves unable to secure the ship, even with such enormous\r\nsacrifice of life, the fletyemings suddenly retreated to the fleet,\r\nleaving us free to rest ourselves and look after the wounded.\r\n\r\nThe terrible strain of the fight had utterly exhausted the sailors,\r\nwho had fought for fifty consecutive hours, without rest or\r\nrefreshment. We tumbled overboard the dead bodies of the enemy who had\r\nfallen upon the deck, and buried eight of our own sailors who had been\r\nalso killed. Several men were wounded about the head and neck with\r\nspear-thrusts that had failed to kill, but none seriously. Captain\r\nWallace got an ugly wound in his neck, but it was not sufficient to\r\nkeep him from duty. Flathootly, in slaying a fletyeming, received a\r\nwound in the hand that required the attention of the doctor. Professor\r\nRackiron and Astronomer Starbottle passed through the fight unscathed,\r\nwhile Professor Goldrock suffered from a broken leg. Our helmets,\r\nprovided originally for triumphal purposes, had proved of the greatest\r\npossible value, and saved many a life on board the _Polar King_.\r\n\r\nAll this time we lay in full view of both the enemy's fleet and the\r\nentire kingdom. It seemed to us a strange thing that the admiral did\r\nnot continue the fight with his reserve of fletyemings, who could\r\neasily outstrip the ship in their flight. He still possessed thousands\r\nof wing-jackets who had never been engaged in actual conflict, who\r\nmight have relieved their exhausted comrades and in time have forced\r\nus to surrender.\r\n\r\nWas the supine conduct of the admiral caused by a panic at our power\r\nof havoc or, did he think my retreat to sea really an effort to escape\r\nthe country?\r\n\r\nIf his truce was caused by a belief that he was unable to cope with us\r\nhe might have called the wayleals of the king to his assistance, but\r\npossibly the pride of the service prevented an alliance with the army\r\nfor naval conquest, more particularly where the naval forces\r\noutnumbered the enemy two hundred to one.\r\n\r\nThe scene of battle lay in full view of the entire nation, just as the\r\nkingdom lay in full view of ourselves. The nearer inhabitants could\r\nsee the movements of the ships and the sailors, and the progress of\r\nthe battle, so far, was known to every one. If the impression was\r\nfavorable to the _Polar King_, doubtless there would be a\r\ndemonstration in favor of the goddess; if not, it would be because the\r\ncapture of our ship was considered certain.\r\n\r\nWe lay to, at a distance of ten miles from the enemy's fleet, awaiting\r\nthe renewal of hostilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nVICTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enemy, finding we were not disposed to leave Atvatabar, began to\r\nmove down upon us once more in battle array. The royal fleet consisted\r\nof seventy ships, the former thirty having been either sunk or\r\ndisabled by us. As for ourselves, the hurricane-deck, masts and\r\nrigging had been hammered to pieces, but the hull was sound, the\r\nsailors enthusiastic, and the terrorite guns unharmed and our spears\r\ninvincible.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy approached us their ships began to move wider apart, with\r\na view no doubt of circumnavigating us, and then close in upon the\r\n_Polar King_ as before. Another squeeze of this kind might prove\r\nfatal, consequently our plan was to keep the enemy at a safe distance\r\nand on one side of us, and destroy his ships one by one with our guns\r\nwhile out of range of his fire, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe admiral did us the favor of keeping around his ship half a dozen\r\nvessels by way of protection, and in this manner drew near. We were\r\ndetermined to bring the engagement to a close as soon as possible by\r\nstriking the enemy a terrible blow. As soon as their vessels drew\r\nwithin range we struck the central group with a shell from the giant\r\ngun. The explosion worked a tremendous havoc among the congregated\r\nvessels, but without waiting to learn its full effect I ordered twenty\r\nshells to be fired into the central mass in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThe result was appalling. The great want of gravity caused a vast\r\nirregular mountain of ships and water to be piled high in the air. We\r\ncould hear the shrieks of drowning and dismembered fletyemings.\r\nVolumes of water shot to tremendous heights, became detached from the\r\nmain mass, and floated in the air for a time in liquid globes.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before the whirl of wrecked ships and angry water,\r\nfilled with perhaps thousands of wing-jackets, subsided to the level\r\nof the ocean again. The ships sank beneath the water, on which floated\r\nhundreds of dead bodies. Those fletyemings who had escaped accident or\r\ndeath, headed by Admiral Jolar, who was still alive, formed themselves\r\ninto a compact mass as they hovered over the scene of the disaster for\r\na final hand-to-hand attack. Re-enforced by thousands of fletyemings\r\nfrom the then unharmed vessels, they approached with yells of\r\n\"Bhoolmakar!\" Finding their ships useless, they were determined to\r\nfling themselves in heroic sacrifice upon us in such numbers as to\r\ncrush us.\r\n\r\nThis was precisely their most dangerous form of attack, but we could\r\nonly await their coming. As the living mass of men approached we\r\nsaluted them with another discharge of shells, which exploded in the\r\nvery heart of the unfortunate host. The carnage was dreadful, and\r\nhundreds of dead bodies fell into the sea. Admiral Jolar was killed,\r\nand without their leader the fletyemings became demoralized. Ere they\r\ncould rally again, we were about to fire another round of shells, when\r\nRear Admiral Gerolio, with a few fletyemings, left the main mass under\r\na flag of truce and approached us.\r\n\r\nWe were nothing loath to receive their message. Alighting on deck, the\r\nrear admiral informed me that owing to the loss of their admiral they\r\nwere disposed to cease fighting provided I would leave the country\r\nforthwith.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"you wish to report that you defeated us by driving us\r\nfrom the country?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall report that it was a mutual cessation of hostilities,\" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\"It has cost us too much to give up the fight now,\" I said. \"One of us\r\nmust surrender.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you surrender, then, to His Majesty Aldemegry Bhoolmakar, King of\r\nAtvatabar?\" eagerly inquired the rear admiral.\r\n\r\n\"Do you surrender to Her Majesty Lyone, Queen of Atvatabar?\" I\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"We make no such surrender,\" said he, very much surprised to know that\r\nLyone had been proclaimed queen. \"If we cannot conquer you by force of\r\narms we have ships enough to starve you into submission.\"\r\n\r\n\"We care nothing for your ships,\" I replied, \"we will destroy them one\r\nby one.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may sink our ships,\" said the rear admiral, \"but you will never\r\nconquer our fletyemings. We will begin a hand-to-hand conflict that\r\nwill not cease until you and your entire crew are killed or are our\r\nprisoners.\"\r\n\r\n\"The truce is at an end,\" I replied. \"Return to your ships\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nThe rear-admiral and his staff rose on their wings, and in a short\r\ntime regained the cloud of naval warriors that hung in the air half a\r\nmile away.\r\n\r\nDuring the truce the ships of the enemy had drawn nearer and at once\r\nopened fire upon us.\r\n\r\nA well-aimed shot struck us under the water-line, penetrating our\r\narmor, and going clean through the side of the vessel. The central\r\ncompartment rapidly filled with water. It was a fatal blow, for\r\nalthough the fore and aft compartments would keep the ship from\r\nsinking, yet it soon put out our boiler fires and left us a helpless\r\nhulk upon the water. The main deck, containing our terrorite guns, was\r\non a level with the water, and a quantity of terrorite and gunpowder\r\nrendered useless. We were in a terrible position, for our small stock\r\nof available ammunition would be soon exhausted. The enemy soon\r\ndiscovered the effect of their blow, and closed around us like\r\nvultures hastening to their prey. We suffered a terrible bombardment,\r\nthat killed more of our men, and finally the fletyemings closed around\r\nus in swarms to annihilate us.\r\n\r\nResolved to sell our lives dearly, we received them with a discharge\r\nof our magazine guns. They quickly rallied and renewed their attack,\r\nbut as long as our ammunition lasted were afraid to come to close\r\nquarters. At last we drew our revolvers and the hand-to-hand conflict\r\nbegan. Some of the sailors used their cutlasses with good effect. We\r\nhad proof that the magnetic spears in close quarters were terrible\r\nweapons. As I saw my men falling around me I felt that the game was\r\nup. I thought of Lyone, and the thought would not let me surrender. I\r\nwas already wounded in the shoulder and body, and stunned, while the\r\nenemy was swarming in greater numbers than ever. Must we surrender?\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at that moment, a shell came screaming through the air and\r\nexploded above the ship, right among the wayleals, killing twenty or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMerciful heavens! Can the enemy, after all, fire shells at us? But why\r\nuse them when the fight is practically over, and why fire them among\r\nhis own wayleals? Another and another shell exploded among the\r\nwayleals around us, and finally a regular tornado of them exploded all\r\naround the _Polar King_, putting the enemy completely to flight.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the air was cleared around us, I saw to my intense\r\nastonishment two friendly vessels, one of which bore the flag of the\r\nUnited States and the other the flag of England, firing shells at the\r\nenemy. I then knew the cause of our deliverance, and shouted for joy.\r\nMy men--all that were alive--rose and cheered our comrades from the\r\nouter world! The excitement was overpowering! We could only, amid\r\ntears of joy, salute them and signal them to keep up the fight. We\r\nwere saved!\r\n\r\nA well-aimed shot from the Englishman sank still another vessel. This\r\nfresh disaster received from the strangers seemed to completely\r\nunnerve the enemy, for, strange to say, every ship afloat struck its\r\ncolors in surrender! It was well that the rear-admiral did so, for it\r\nwould have been only a question of time until his whole fleet would\r\nhave been destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe fletyemings retreated to their ships, and in a short time the\r\ngold-plated ship of Rear-Admiral Gerolio, under the flag of truce,\r\ncame alongside our vessel. The rear-admiral and his staff came on\r\nboard, and delivered up his sword in token of surrender.\r\n\r\n\"You surrender to me as admiral of Her Majesty Lyone, Queen of\r\nAtvatabar?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said the rear-admiral, \"and am willing to devote my services\r\nto the cause of her majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will your fletyemings as well as yourself swear allegiance to Queen\r\nLyone and her cause?\"\r\n\r\n\"We swear it!\" yelled the fletyemings of the rear-admiral's ship, and,\r\nat a signal from their leader, the flag of the new queen took the\r\nplace of the flag of his deposed majesty, King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the entire fleet exhibited the flag of her holiness as the\r\nsymbol of their new allegiance. This was a gratifying victory, as it\r\nprocured for our cause more than sixty fully manned vessels of war and\r\ntwenty-five thousand fletyemings.\r\n\r\nLyone was mistress of the seas!\r\n\r\n\"How came you to surrender at this juncture?\" I inquired of the\r\nrear-admiral.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" he replied, \"we have already lost more men and ships than\r\nif we had been engaged with an enemy similarly armed and having as\r\nmany vessels as ourselves, and when the strange vessels came to your\r\nassistance we saw it was useless to prolong the fight. We saw that\r\nwith your terrible weapons you were invincible. You can destroy us and\r\nwe cannot destroy you, therefore I concluded, as rear-admiral of the\r\nfleet and successor to Admiral Jolar, who was killed in battle, that\r\nit was throwing life away to continue the fight. I saw, furthermore,\r\nthat with you as the champion of the goddess her cause would succeed,\r\nand I wanted to be the first to render homage to her majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have acted well,\" I replied, \"and to reward your action, I now,\r\nin the name of her majesty, appoint and proclaim you rear-admiral of\r\nthe fleet of Lyone, Queen of Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received with frantic cheers by the sailors of\r\nboth vessels.\r\n\r\nNow that I was master of the sea, I intended to immediately extend my\r\noperations to the cause of the queen on land, and assuming the dignity\r\nof admiral, appointed Captain Wallace of the _Polar King_ also\r\nrear-admiral of the fleet.\r\n\r\nThis announcement was received with the firing of guns and tremendous\r\ncheers.\r\n\r\n\"Rear-Admiral Wallace, Rear-Admiral Gerolio, and myself,\" I said to\r\nthe sailors, \"will determine the question of who will become the\r\nremaining high naval officers, and now that the battle is over, let us\r\nsee that our wounded are properly cared for and all ships afloat put\r\nin proper repair.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious victory!\r\n\r\nAll this time the two cruisers who so fortunately arrived in time to\r\nturn the tide of battle in our favor were rapidly approaching us,\r\nfiring guns in honor of our victory. I acknowledged their arrival, as\r\nwell as their valuable services, by having the royal fleet drawn up in\r\ndouble file, between which lay the _Polar King_, and ordering every\r\nvessel to give the strangers a salute of one hundred guns.\r\n\r\nMy anxiety to learn more of our allies was so great that I despatched\r\ntwo of my most active wing-jackets to the strange vessels to procure\r\naccurate information concerning them and their object in visiting the\r\ninterior world. The wayleals returned with the information that the\r\nvessels were the United States ship of discovery _Mercury_, commanded\r\nby Captain Adams, and the English ship of discovery _Aurora Borealis_,\r\ncommanded by Sir John Forbes. Both were fitted out by their respective\r\ngovernments to explore the interior world consequent on the report of\r\nBoatswain Dunbar and Seaman Henderson, the only survivors of the\r\ntwelve men who left the _Polar King_ when in the Polar Gulf. The\r\nrespective commanders, officers and men of the incoming vessels were\r\ndelighted to know that the _Polar King_ was not only safe, but had\r\ndiscovered Atvatabar, and that its commander was at present king of\r\nthe realm. This was the substance of the despatches sent me by Captain\r\nAdams and Commander Forbes, and addressed, \"To Lexington White, Esq.,\r\nCommander of the _Polar King_.\" Captain Adams stated that Boatswain\r\nDunbar was on board his vessel as pilot, accompanied by Seaman\r\nHenderson.\r\n\r\nOwing to the waterlogged condition of the _Polar King_, we could only\r\nwait the arrival of the vessels. When near at hand, a simultaneous\r\nsalute of guns reverberated upon the sea, which must have been heard\r\nin all Atvatabar. Amid the smoke and noise of the roaring guns, steam\r\nlaunches had put off from the _Mercury_ and _Aurora Borealis_, and in\r\na very short time the commanders of both vessels stood upon the deck\r\nof the _Polar King_, accompanied by their respective officers. I\r\nembraced Captain Adams and Commander Forbes, and introduced the\r\nstrangers to Rear-Admiral Wallace, Rear-Admiral Gerolio and staff, who\r\nwere no less delighted and surprised than myself to receive visitors\r\nfrom the outer world. When the commanders reached the deck of the\r\n_Polar King_ the cheers of the American and British sailors, mingled\r\nwith the shouts of our fletyemings, made a soul-stirring scene.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I was already beginning to think the outer world a more or\r\nless mythical place, and thought the doctrine of reincarnation had an\r\nillustration or proof in myself. After all, the outer world really\r\nexisted, and, strange as it seemed to the Atvatabarese, there was\r\nreally an outer sun and live beings like themselves, only physically\r\nmore vigorous.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to set out at once for Kioram, as the _Polar King_\r\nwas in a sinking condition.\r\n\r\nEvery man had been either killed or wounded. We made a total loss of\r\nsixty men, including the ten who left the ship in the Polar Gulf, thus\r\nmaking the entire company of the _Polar King_ but fifty souls.\r\n\r\nAs for the ship, her plating was burst apart in many places and full\r\nof started bolts, caused by missiles of the enemy. The central\r\ncompartment was filled with water, and the masts, sails, smoke-stack\r\nand hurricane-deck were practically destroyed.\r\n\r\nMany of the guns were not struck once in the entire fight, and were\r\nready for active service any moment. The terrorite battery was\r\npartially submerged, but still in good condition.\r\n\r\nCaptain Adams and Sir John Forbes both craved the honor of towing the\r\n_Polar King_ into port, to which I willingly assented.\r\n\r\nAs admiral, I at once assumed command of the fleet, which I ordered to\r\nmake sail for Kioram without delay. The fleet fell behind in good\r\norder, and followed the _Polar King_, bearing the victorious flag of\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEWS OF ATVATABAR IN THE OUTER WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Atvatabar lay before us like a continent drawn upon a\r\nmap, or, rather, upon the interior surface of a sphere or globe,\r\neverywhere visible to the naked eye. Its green forests, its impressive\r\nmountains, its rushing rivers, its white and many-colored cities, its\r\nwide-stretching shores, fringed with the foam of an azure sea, lay\r\nbefore the astonished eyes of our visitors.\r\n\r\nWhen within a few miles of the city, Governor Ladalmir, accompanied by\r\nCaptains Pra and Nototherboc, advanced to meet us in a large magnetic\r\nyacht, bearing the flag of Lyone. The governor hastened to inform us\r\nthat, in view of our victory, the city of Kioram had declared its\r\nallegiance to the cause of Lyone, and invited myself and officers of\r\nthe fleet, as well as our distinguished allies from the outer world,\r\nto a banquet in the fortress of Kioram. This news gave me great\r\nsatisfaction, as the city would be a splendid base of military\r\noperations. The officers and seamen of the _Mercury_ and _Aurora\r\nBorealis_ created quite as great a sensation in the streets of Kioram\r\nas did the victorious sailors of the _Polar King_.\r\n\r\nLanding on _terra firma_, Governor Ladalmir took the opportunity of\r\nshowing our guests the beauty of his bockhockids, who formed a guard\r\nof honor to the fortress, where we were all royally received.\r\n\r\nThe two captains, together with their officers and sailors, were\r\nastonished at the multitude of strange objects shown them. Captain\r\nAdams would not remain satisfied until he was accoutred with a dynamo\r\nand a pair of magnic wings, with which all the sailors and soldiers of\r\nAtvatabar were supplied as part of their uniform. He was shown how\r\nthe battery of metals gave motion to the dynamo, which in turn acted\r\non the steel levers connected with the ribs of the wings. Although the\r\nworthy captain was of considerable weight, yet his astonishment at\r\nbeing able to skim through the air like a swallow was great. No sooner\r\ndid he touch the button than all his preconceived notions of\r\nlocomotion were destroyed, and he gasped with fear at his own\r\nprodigious motion. The two facts of unfailing movement of wings and\r\nexceptional buoyancy of body soon made him a fearless rider of the\r\nwind. He alighted on the earth with the greatest enthusiasm over the\r\nsuccess of his experiment.\r\n\r\nThe magnic spear was another surprise for our guests. Sir John Forbes\r\nwas astonished at my being able to fight the fletyemings so long,\r\narmed as they were by so potent a weapon of death. He would certainly\r\nrecommend its use in the British army and navy on his return to\r\nEngland. Our allies were surprised at everything they saw,\r\nparticularly at the rapid movements of the fletyemings or wing-jackets\r\nof the royal navy. They thought it an extraordinary thing the sailors\r\nshould fly by magnic wings.\r\n\r\nAfter the banquet Captain Adams, who was a fine type of an American\r\nseaman, bold, alert and courageous, gave us an account of how both the\r\nUnited States and England came to send ships into the interior world.\r\nIt appeared that the story of Boatswain Dunbar first published in the\r\nNew York papers, that the _Polar King_ had sailed down the Polar Gulf\r\n_en route_ to an interior world, had created a tremendous sensation on\r\nthe outer sphere, and all civilized nations immediately fitted out\r\nvessels of discovery to follow up the _Polar King_ and make\r\ndiscoveries for the benefit of their respective governments. So far as\r\nany one knew, only two vessels had succeeded in entering the interior\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThe recital of Captain Adams was frequently interrupted by Sir John\r\nForbes, the British captain, a courageous officer, who possessed all\r\nthe stately dignity of his race. He stated that since the discovery of\r\nAmerica by Columbus no other event had awakened such unbounded\r\nenthusiasm as the discovery of a polar gulf and an interior world.\r\n\r\n\"I am most of all interested at present,\" said I, \"in the story of how\r\nDunbar reached civilization again after parting with us. I forgive\r\nyou, Dunbar,\" I continued, addressing him, \"for your mutinous conduct,\r\nand now let us hear the story of your adventures in the Polar Sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admiral,\" said Dunbar, \"had we known the terrible hardships we would\r\nhave to endure in making our way home, chiefly on foot and at the same\r\ntime burdened with the boat, we would never have left the ship. But\r\nyou must thank me for the presence of the two ships that are here\r\nto-day and for the fame you already enjoy in the outer world.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's something tremendous,\" said Captain Adams.\r\n\r\n\"How did your geographers receive the news of the interior world?\" I\r\ninquired of Sir John Forbes.\r\n\r\n\"I need not say that the English geographers, in common with the\r\nentire nation, were greatly excited at the news. The Royal\r\nGeographical Society have already made you an honorary member, and it\r\nwas actually proposed at one of the meetings that the government\r\nshould proclaim a special holiday as a day of rejoicing for so great a\r\ndiscovery. This would certainly have been done but for the fact that\r\nthe story rested entirely on the testimony of two sailors, and that\r\nany public rejoicing should be postponed until the story of the\r\nsailors would be verified by a special expedition sent from England.\r\nOf course, many people think that Dunbar's story is a fable or a\r\nhallucination that he himself believes in. On the other hand, hundreds\r\nof professional and amateur astronomers and geographers are proving by\r\nmathematics that the earth must be a hollow sphere, and the story of\r\nthe open poles an entirely physical possibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people of the United States,\" said Captain Adams, \"are almost\r\nunanimous in the belief that the interior world is a veritable\r\nreality, and it only requires a return of my ship to convince every\r\none that Dunbar's story falls very short of the glorious reality.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no man more famous to-day than Lexington White, Admiral of\r\nAtvatabar!\" said Sir John Forbes.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, gentlemen, for your kind words,\" said I; \"and now for\r\nDunbar's story.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, admiral,\" said Captain Adams, \"that if I were to read you\r\nthe article containing Dunbar's story written by a special\r\ncommissioner of the New York _Western Hemisphere_, who was the first\r\nto interview Dunbar at Sitka, on learning of his arrival there, it\r\nwould be perhaps the best narration of his perilous adventures.\" As\r\nthe captain spoke he drew a copy of the _Western Hemisphere_ from his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" I replied, \"let us hear what the press said about\r\nDunbar and his adventures.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Captain Adams read the New York _Western Hemisphere's_\r\naccount of Dunbar's adventures, as follows:\r\n\r\n                   \"AN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY!\r\n\r\n        \"THE NORTH POLE FOUND TO BE AN ENORMOUS CAVERN,\r\n                LEADING TO A SUBTERRANEAN WORLD!\r\n\r\n      \"THE EARTH PROVES TO BE A HOLLOW SHELL ONE THOUSAND\r\n           MILES IN THICKNESS, LIT BY AN INTERIOR SUN!\r\n\r\n     \"OCEANS AND CONTINENTS, ISLANDS AND CITIES SPREAD UPON\r\n             THE ROOF OF THE INTERIOR SPHERE!\r\n\r\n      \"BOATSWAIN DUNBAR AND SEAMAN HENDERSON, OF THE 'POLAR\r\n       KING,' HAVING DESERTED THE SHIP AS SHE WAS ENTERING\r\n           PLUTUSIA, HAVE ARRIVED AT SITKA, ALASKA,\r\n            IN A DESPERATE CONDITION, AND HAVE\r\n              BEEN INTERVIEWED BY A 'WESTERN\r\n                 HEMISPHERE' COMMISSIONER.\r\n\r\n        \"THEY SAY LEXINGTON WHITE, COMMANDER OF THE 'POLAR\r\n           KING,' IS AT PRESENT SAILING UNDERNEATH CANADA\r\n                     ON AN INTERIOR SEA!\r\n\r\n        \"TREMENDOUS POSSIBILITIES FOR SCIENCE AND COMMERCE!\r\n\r\n           \"THE FABLED REALMS OF PLUTO NO LONGER A MYTH!\r\n\r\n            \"GOLD! GOLD! BEYOND THE DREAMS OF MADNESS!\r\n\r\n\"The story of the discovery of Plutusia and the Polar Gulf, as told by\r\nthe two shipwrecked survivors of the mutineers of the _Polar King_ now\r\nat Sitka, Alaska, to the _Western Hemisphere_, will form an epoch in\r\nthe history of the world. The renown of Columbus and Magellan is\r\novershadowed by the glory of Lexington White, a citizen of the United\r\nStates, who fitted out a ship for polar discovery, and, taking the\r\ncommand himself, has unravelled the mystery of the North Pole,\r\ndiscovered the Polar Gulf and the interior world.\r\n\r\n\"Having penetrated the Polar Gulf about three hundred miles, and\r\nhaving discovered the interior sun, a fear seized on a number of the\r\nsailors, among whom were Boatswain Dunbar and his companion,\r\nHenderson, who are the only survivors of twelve men who left the\r\n_Polar King_ in an open boat to return home again, and to whose safe\r\narrival in Sitka the world is indebted for news of the important\r\ndiscoveries that had been made.\r\n\r\n\"Dunbar and Henderson arrived in Sitka in a very forlorn condition,\r\nalmost starved to death and utterly exhausted with their terrible\r\njourney homeward. They seem to forget largely the incidents of the\r\njourney outward in the _Polar King_, but have a very clear\r\nrecollection of their own individual experiences in returning to\r\ncivilization again. Dunbar, with his eleven associates and the\r\nEsquimaux dogs, were no sooner cut adrift from the _Polar King_ than\r\nthey began to realize their terrible position. Borne on the breast of\r\nthe immense tidal wave that vibrated up and down the polar cavern,\r\nthey were tossed helplessly to and fro, now flung almost out of its\r\nmouth and again sucked back into its midnight recesses. They floated\r\nfor days in the gigantic tunnel of water that threatened to collapse\r\nany moment and overwhelm them. They would fain have returned to the\r\nship, but the breeze blowing out of the cavern wafted them far from\r\ntheir comrades, and they therefore bent all their energies to the task\r\nof getting home again. The light of the polar summer that lit the\r\nmouth of the gulf was their guide that led them back to the old\r\nfamiliar world.\r\n\r\n\"Happily for the adventurers, the direction of the wind continued\r\nfavorable to their voyage. They made about a hundred miles a day, and\r\nin five days reached the edge of the outer ocean. Here again the\r\ngrandeur of the scene appalled them. Let the reader imagine a little\r\nboat carrying twelve souls out of that monstrous cavern five hundred\r\nmiles in diameter. Think of fifteen hundred miles of ocean forming the\r\nmouth of the world that shone in the Arctic sunlight like molten\r\nsilver surrounding an abyss of darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Dunbar and his companions had no sooner emerged from the gulf and\r\nseen once more the light of the sun--our own sun--than they wept for\r\njoy. But again, when they thought of the terrible barrier of ice they\r\nhad to cross again they began to wish they had remained with the\r\n_Polar King_. Thus man fluctuates between this or that impulse, as he\r\nis moved.\r\n\r\n\"'I say, captain,' said Walker, one of the men, 'don't you think it\r\nabout as safe to go back and find the ship as to run the chance of\r\nbeing frozen to death on the ice?'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said Dunbar, 'when we left the ship everybody knew it was for\r\ngood. Our shipmates have chosen their course, as we chose ours, and\r\nit's too late to go back now. As likely as not she may have struck a\r\nrock and has gone to the bottom by this time.'\r\n\r\n\"As the boat cleared the cavern the sea fell down before them, until\r\nat noonday the sun itself was visible, a joyful proof that they had at\r\nlast gained the normal surface of the earth again.\r\n\r\n\"When three days out of the gulf, the weather grew suddenly colder,\r\nand the sky became obscured with clouds, completely hiding the sun\r\nfrom sight. A furious snow-storm overtook the voyagers, who, benumbed\r\nwith cold, wished they were only back again under the hurricane-deck\r\nof the _Polar King_. Fortunately, the wind blew steadily toward the\r\nArctic Circle, bringing them nearer home, but such was the anxiety and\r\nsuffering caused by insufficient protection from the inclement climate\r\nthat they cared not whither they drifted, so long as they could keep\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n\"By the help of a little oil-stove they boiled their coffee under a\r\nsail, which, spread horizontally above them, in some measure kept the\r\nsnow from burying them alive.\r\n\r\n\"The storm spent its fury in twenty-four hours, and when the air grew\r\nclear again they were saluted with the sight of that enormous ridge of\r\nice through which the _Polar King_ found a passage a month before. The\r\nice was heaped up with the purest snow in places twenty feet in depth.\r\nThousands of icy peaks and pinnacles, as far as the eye could reach,\r\npierced the sky. Under other conditions the sight would have been\r\nsublime, but to men frozen and famished with insufficient food it was\r\na scene of terror.\r\n\r\n\"The icy range was flanked by an ice-foot varying from thirty to sixty\r\nmiles in width, and from four to fifty feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\"Here was the problem that confronted Dunbar--he had to travel over at\r\nleast thirty miles of icy splinters over an ice-foot whose surface was\r\nbroken into every possible contortion of crystallization. There were\r\nmounds, hummocks, caverns, crevasses, ridges and gulfs of the hardest\r\nand oldest ice. Then when this barrier was crossed there was the icy\r\nbackbone of the whole system, five hundred to a thousand feet in\r\nheight, to be crossed, as there was no lane or opening to be\r\ndiscovered through so formidable a range of ice mountains. Even if he\r\nsucceeded in crossing the same, there would certainly be an\r\nice-foot of perhaps greater dimensions than the one before him to\r\ncross, and that might prove to be only a valley of ice leading to\r\nother and still more inaccessible cliffs to be surmounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WE SLOWLY DRAGGED OURSELVES ACROSS THE RANGE OF ICY\r\nPEAKS.]\r\n\r\n\"'This is no place to die in,' said Dunbar, 'and so, boys, we've got\r\nto hustle if we ever expect to get home.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ay, ay, sir,' said his companions, but when they reached the ice\r\nthey found that having remained in a cramped position for a month in\r\nthe boat had incapacitated them for walking.\r\n\r\n\"It was also found that Walker's feet and those of four other sailors\r\nhad been frostbitten, and that they were totally unable to be of any\r\nservice to themselves or the others.\r\n\r\n\"The outlook was mournful in the extreme. The only thing that cheered\r\nthem was the constant sunlight, and even that consolation would depart\r\nin another month, and if in the mean time they did not get away from\r\nthe ice, hunger and the awful desolation of a polar winter would\r\nterminate their existence.\r\n\r\n\"There was no chance of starting on their journey until they got\r\naccustomed to the use of their limbs, and so they built a hut of\r\nblocks of ice, which were solidly frozen together by a few buckets\r\nfull of sea water thrown over them.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs were glad to get on the ice again, and scampered about\r\ntotally oblivious of the fact that the supply of pork was getting very\r\nlow, and unless they got some fresh meat very soon they would be\r\nobliged to feed on each other.\r\n\r\n\"They remained a fortnight in their Arctic abode exercising themselves\r\nby cutting a passage in the ice. During this time four of the sailors\r\ndied. Finally the remainder, packing everything into the boat, yoked\r\nthe dogs thereto, and started in anything but hopeful spirits on their\r\narduous journey.\r\n\r\n\"It was found that Walker had to be carried along, but he did not long\r\ncontinue a burden to his associates, for on the fourth day of the\r\nmarch he died, and was buried in the snow. It was a toilsome journey.\r\nAlmost every foot of the way required to be hewn out of ice as hard as\r\nadamant.\r\n\r\n\"The dogs suffered greatly from insufficient food and tireless\r\nexertion. Several died from complete exhaustion, and were greedily\r\ndevoured by their fellows.\r\n\r\n\"After desperate exertions, Dunbar and his company, now reduced to\r\nseven souls, gained the crest of the ice range and had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing open water not twenty miles away. It took some\r\ntime to discover the best route for a descent, but at last they\r\nreached the level of the ice-foot beyond, and struck for open sea. A\r\nfortunate capture of several seals re-enforced their almost exhausted\r\nsupply of provisions.\r\n\r\n\"Dunbar cared nothing about latitude or longitude or scientific\r\ninformation in such a desperate fight for life. It was a joyful moment\r\nwhen he and his companions launched their boat safe into the sea again\r\nafter the incredible toil of dragging it forty miles across the\r\nsplintered ice peaks and the terrible ice-foot north and south of the\r\npaleocrystic mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Dunbar hoisted his sail, abandoning the few dogs who yet remained\r\nalive, and with his unhappy companions steered for Behring Strait,\r\nfirst making for the coast of Alaska that faces the desolation of the\r\nArctic seas.\r\n\r\n\"It would be impossible to describe the horrors of that lonely voyage.\r\nThe terrible struggle with five hundred miles of ice-floes, with\r\nsnow-storms that piled the snow high upon the voyagers, and the\r\nferocious cold, proved too much for five of the seven sailors, and one\r\nby one the poor fellows died, and were thrown overboard.\r\n\r\n\"Only two men--Dunbar and a sailor named Henderson--emerged from the\r\nArctic Sea, arriving in six months from the time they left the ship,\r\nin Sitka, Alaska.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGES OF THE \"MERCURY\" AND THE \"AURORA BOREALIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was a most fortunate thing that any of the men could live until\r\nthey reached civilization,\" I said, when Captain Adams had finished\r\nhis reading of Dunbar's story in the paper.\r\n\r\n\"It was solely due to that fact that we are here at present, admiral,\"\r\nreplied Captain Adams. \"No sooner was the story published than the\r\ngreatest possible excitement arose both in America and Europe. The\r\nUnited States and Britain felt chagrined that a private citizen had\r\nbeen able to achieve what the greatest nations on earth, with\r\nunlimited men and money, were unable to accomplish. To satisfy popular\r\nclamor the United States, Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany,\r\nItaly and Spain each fitted out separate expeditions to follow in the\r\nwake of the _Polar King_. These were manned with former Arctic\r\nnavigators, and were in each case commissioned and fitted out\r\nregardless of cost to explore the interior world and lay the\r\nfoundation of future conquest and commerce. The Secretary of the\r\nUnited States Navy, at Washington, sent for Dunbar and Henderson, and\r\nforthwith employed both as pilots for the _Mercury_ expedition under\r\nmy command.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did the English people receive the news?\" I inquired of Sir John\r\nForbes.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to say, admiral,\" he replied, \"that the story of the\r\n_Polar King_ was the sole topic of conversation for weeks throughout\r\nthe United Kingdom. The Royal Geographical Society, the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society, and the Travellers' Club, all sent special\r\ndeputations to the government, asking for the fitting out of a ship to\r\nundertake British research, which might possibly accompany the United\r\nStates vessel having the pilots Dunbar and Henderson on board, and\r\nthus partake of the advantage these guides would naturally give the\r\nUnited States vessel.\r\n\r\n\"The British Government,\" continued Sir John, with a smile in his eye,\r\n\"saw at once that British interests in the interior world must be\r\nprotected at all hazards, and gave the Lords of the Admiralty full\r\npower to act.\r\n\r\n\"My fame as an Arctic navigator and as the discoverer of the bones of\r\nthe great Irish Arctic hero, Montgomery, and those of his men, in a\r\ncabin on Prince Albert's Island, caused the Lords of the Admiralty to\r\nplace at my command the frigate _Aurora Borealis_, manned by\r\nexperienced Arctic sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Negotiations were opened with the United States Government, whereby\r\nthe _Aurora Borealis_, by proceeding up the northwest passage along\r\nthe route followed by the Montgomery expedition, might meet the\r\n_Mercury_, who would enter the Arctic Sea by way of Behring Strait. It\r\nwas arranged, as Captain Adams is aware, that each vessel should\r\nproceed direct to latitude 75 N., longitude 140 W., and there await\r\nthe other vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Captain Adams, \"for my instructions were of the\r\nsame nature. The _Mercury_ was fitted out in Brooklyn Navy Yard, and\r\nas soon as her complement of two hundred and fifty officers,\r\nexplorers, scientists, press correspondents and seamen was enrolled,\r\nand her stores fully shipped, I was instructed to proceed by way of\r\nthe Nicaragua Canal to San Francisco for further orders and stores.\r\nLeaving San Francisco I next touched Victoria, B.C., and finally at\r\nSitka, Alaska, for final orders. The entire winter had been consumed\r\nin getting ready, and by May 1 I cleared for Behring Strait, steering\r\nstraight for the rendezvous in the Arctic Sea where we had arranged to\r\nmeet by June 1. I was first on the spot, and had the good fortune of\r\nonly having to wait a week before we sighted the _Aurora Borealis_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" said Sir John, \"began the real work of the voyage. All had\r\nbeen plain sailing so far, but it was clearly impossible for any\r\nvessel to reach the Polar Gulf unless a lead was discovered in the ice\r\nbarrier similar to that so fortunately discovered by the _Polar King_.\r\nIt was here that the services of Dunbar as pilot came into\r\nrequisition. Captain Adams had got him to mark on the chart as near as\r\npossible the location of the chasm in the ice mountain discovered by\r\nthe _Polar King_. That once rediscovered, we could succeed in\r\nfollowing the _Polar King_; but should we fail in our quest, all\r\nfurther progress would be impossible. I often said to Captain Adams\r\nthat I considered Lexington White as one of the most fortunate of men.\r\nIt was nothing short of the miraculous that you should discover a\r\nnewly-rent passage through the barrier of ice that for ages has\r\nguarded the sublime secret of the pole. Only once in all the eternity\r\nof the past did the gate of that thrilling Arctic zone open itself to\r\nhumanity, and by a miracle of fortune you were on the spot at the\r\nright moment, ready to enter that open door. That fact alone emblazons\r\nyou with glory. But to my story. How were we to discover the same or a\r\nsimilar lead to the north? On the mere chance of discovering such a\r\npassage both vessels had encountered the dangers and terrors of the\r\nArctic desolations. Dunbar located the chasm in latitude 78.6 N.,\r\nlongitude 125 W., and thither we sailed.\r\n\r\n\"As for the expeditions sent out by the other governments of Europe,\r\njealous of American prowess, we have not seen or heard of any of them.\r\nTheir vessels followed the direction of the Gulf Stream, and the\r\ninstructions given their commanders were to first make Spitzbergen,\r\nand thence proceed due north, and if possible find there a passage to\r\nthe pole. For ourselves, I will let Captain Adams tell how we got\r\nthrough the ice barrier.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Captain Adams, \"is a simple enough story, but the actual\r\nexperiences were not so simple as the recital of them. We found that\r\nDunbar's estimate of the location of the passage was within fifty\r\nmiles of the exact spot. We found the passage after some days'\r\nsearching, about fifty miles beyond Dunbar's location on the chart.\r\nThe veritable passage was there, but, as was expected, instead of open\r\nwater there was a mass of solid ice of unknown thickness, but\r\nfortunately having a smooth surface.\r\n\r\n\"There was but one thing to do to overcome such an obstacle, and that\r\nwas to haul the ships on runners on top of the ice, right through the\r\ngap formed by nature in the icy barrier. Our labors in making such a\r\npassage were simply superhuman. Both crews were employed for more than\r\na week in sloping the ice-foot up which the vessels were to be\r\ndragged. Then an enormous cradle had to be constructed of massive\r\nbeams of wood securely bolted together, large and strong enough to\r\ncarry either vessel. There was fortunately lumber enough for this\r\npurpose, as among the stores of both ships timbers for building Arctic\r\nhuts had been included. The cradle was first secured to the hull of\r\nthe _Mercury_, and the crews of both vessels took hold of the ropes\r\nmade fast to her decks. She was drawn close to the ice, but utterly\r\nrefused to leave the water. We tried fixing anchors in the ice ahead,\r\nto which were attached a system of blocks and ropes. These\r\nsupplemented the strength of the men by the hoisting engine, but even\r\nthis was of no avail. We next rigged up a large drum, vertically over\r\nthe shaft of the propeller, and connected it therewith by means of\r\nright-angled cog-wheels. To this was fastened an immense cable, to the\r\nother end of which were attached the ropes rove through blocks held\r\nfirmly a quarter-of a mile ahead by thirty anchors imbedded in the\r\nice. We started the engines, and, sure enough, the bows of the vessel\r\nbegan to rise out of the water. The _Mercury_ would have been lifted\r\nhigh and dry on the ice were it not that at that moment several of the\r\nsmaller cables in the blocks snapped asunder, and thus our third\r\neffort failed. At this juncture, Sir John Forbes proposed to plant a\r\nfew more anchors in the ice, and through the additional blocks work a\r\ncable leading from the bows of the _Mercury_ to the stern of the\r\n_Aurora Borealis_. This being done, he would steam ahead off the ice\r\nand add the power of his ship to that of the _Mercury's_ engine, and\r\nthus relieve the strain on the _Mercury's_ cables. It was a capital\r\nidea, and we immediately put it into execution. The result was a\r\nperfect success. The combined energies of the English ship and her\r\ncrew, together with those of our own vessel and men, drew the\r\n_Mercury_ up the slide of ice, and placed her erect and dry upon the\r\nlevel surface of the lead. It was now comparatively easy work to draw\r\nthe ship along the ice. Her own engines were equal to the task; but it\r\nwas impossible for the _Mercury_ to go ahead, as, without her\r\nassistance, the _Aurora Borealis_ would be unable to leave the water.\r\nThen, again, there was only the material for but one cradle for both\r\nships. The difficulty was solved by cutting away one-fourth of the\r\ncradle from beneath both bow and stern of the _Mercury_, and, joining\r\nthese parts, we furnished the _Aurora Borealis_ with a sledge as large\r\nas that of our own ship, and strong enough to keep her in an upright\r\nposition while being dragged over the ice. After infinite trouble, and\r\nin obedience to the aggregated energies of the engines of both ships\r\nand the hauling of the combined crews, the English ship was drawn up\r\nupon the ice beside the American vessel. This double feat of skill and\r\ndetermination was duly saluted by a roar of guns and the cheers of the\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\n\"The ice proved so smooth and hard that the crews of each ship,\r\nassisted by the engines, were able to work their respective vessels in\r\ngood order through the entire chasm, a distance of seventy miles.\r\nArriving at the open floe beyond the northern ice-foot, we bevelled\r\noff the ice as before, and the ships were finally launched upon the\r\npolar sea.\"\r\n\r\nI congratulated Sir John Forbes and Captain Adams on their successful\r\nmanoeuvre, which resulted in getting their ships across the ice. It\r\nwas a feat of engineering skill rarely possible of accomplishment, and\r\nin their case nature had seconded their efforts by providing a smooth\r\nand solid floor to operate upon, otherwise all human endeavor would\r\nhave been fruitless.\r\n\r\n\"And now, gentlemen,\" I said, \"what do you say surprised you most in\r\nyour voyage hither from the ice barrier?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, admiral,\" said Captain Adams, \"that the grandest sight on\r\nearth is the full view of the Polar Gulf, with its suspended abyss of\r\nwaters surrounding the ship. The colossal flux and reflux of waters\r\nproduces a feeling of terrible sublimity. It is an awful scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that scene,\" said Sir John Forbes, \"belongs to the outer world.\r\nThis aspect of the interior world of Plutusia is ten thousand times\r\nmore magnificent. What grander glory ever fell on human eyes than this\r\nColosseum of oceans, continents, kingdoms, islands and seas spread\r\nupon the vast interior vault surrounding us, and all lit up by the\r\ninternal sun! The human imagination never conceived anything equal to\r\nthis. Here nature surpasses the wildest dreams of fancy. We are\r\nastounded with the splendor of such a world!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Sir John,\" said Captain Adams; \"this interior sphere\r\nsurpasses anything hitherto discovered in heaven or earth. And then to\r\nthink of its enormous riches! The royal fleet of Atvatabar, plated\r\nwith solid gold, proves the extraordinary profusion of the precious\r\nmetal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE ARREST OF LYONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the entertainment was at its height, we were surprised by one of\r\nthe guards informing us that a messenger had arrived at the fortress\r\nfrom Egyplosis, bearing for me a despatch of the utmost importance\r\nfrom the high priest Hushnoly.\r\n\r\nWe were all excitement at the news, and on opening the despatch, I\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_To His Excellency_ LEXINGTON WHITE, _Lord Admiral of\r\n     Atvatabar, Greeting_:\r\n\r\n     \"Your glorious victory over the royal fleet has awakened\r\n     popular excitement in favor of deposing His Majesty King\r\n     Aldemegry Bhoolmakar, and establishing our late beloved\r\n     goddess Lyone on the throne, as queen of Atvatabar.\r\n     Egyplosis has openly espoused the cause of Lyone, and the\r\n     sacred college of priests and priestesses have taken up arms\r\n     in favor of the goddess. His majesty, being resolved to\r\n     stamp out rebellion at any cost, has caused the arrest of\r\n     Lyone at her palace, Tanje, and has confined her in the\r\n     fortress Calnogor as hostage for the good behavior of the\r\n     people. He has threatened to put Lyone to death in case her\r\n     followers attempt any hostile demonstrations against the\r\n     king's authority. We of Egyplosis are committed to the\r\n     cause of Her Majesty Lyone, Queen of Atvatabar!\r\n\r\n                                                    HUSHNOLY.\"\r\n\r\nThis was most alarming news! While we had been feasting in inglorious\r\nease our queen had been arrested and imprisoned! The time for action\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nEre we could deliberate on the best course to pursue, a second message\r\nfrom Hushnoly arrived, stating that the king, hearing of the outbreak\r\nin Egyplosis, had ordered Coltonobory, the commander-in-chief, to\r\nproceed with his wayleals to Egyplosis, to capture Hushnoly and\r\ndisband his followers. This being an open declaration of war, had\r\nprecipitated a civil struggle, and the armies both of the king and\r\nqueen were being recruited with great excitement on both sides. As for\r\nKioram, that city had declared for our cause, and the governor was\r\noverjoyed to know that the victory of the _Polar King_ had resulted in\r\nthe entire fleet espousing the cause of Lyone.\r\n\r\nI questioned Governor Ladalmir on the strength and equipment of both\r\nthe king's forces and those willing to support Lyone, and the\r\nprobabilities of our cause being successful.\r\n\r\nHe informed me that the king already commanded an army of half a\r\nmillion men, composed two-thirds of wayleals and one-third\r\nbockhockids, or flying cavalry, armed with swords, shields and spears\r\nof deadly power. The adherents of Lyone numbered already one hundred\r\nthousand men, who had also proclaimed her queen of Atvatabar,\r\nincluding five thousand amazons from Egyplosis, who would fight for\r\ntheir late goddess to the death, all similarly armed.\r\n\r\n\"The future is doubtful,\" said the governor; \"but with your aid we may\r\nwell hope for success. I congratulate you on your splendid victory,\r\nwhich is already known throughout the kingdom, and will increase our\r\nforces to two hundred and fifty thousand men. It will cheer the heart\r\nof our late goddess to know that she also already possesses a powerful\r\nfleet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you consider the queen in any immediate danger at the hands of the\r\nking or government?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the governor, \"at the present stage of affairs it is\r\ndifficult to think that either king or Borodemy would dare to execute\r\nher majesty, even although it might be according to law. Yet, if\r\nalarmed at the partial destruction and defection of the fleet and the\r\ngrowing power of the queen's followers, the bloodthirsty king and\r\nfrightened government might possibly execute her, especially if they\r\nsaw no hope for themselves in the coming struggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said I, \"whether we fight or not, our queen is in very serious\r\ndanger of death?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I most fear,\" said the governor. \"As soon as I heard of\r\nthe imprisonment of her majesty I called a review of my garrison of\r\nwayleals and bockhockids, and asked them if they would espouse the\r\ncause of the queen, and to a man they swore allegiance thereto. I\r\nconceive the only way to secure respect for the queen is to make her\r\nfollowers as formidable as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Action,\" I added, \"is imperative. We must strike the king's army a\r\nfearful blow, to impress his majesty with respect for our power. The\r\nqueen must either be released by the king or we will release her\r\nourselves. There must be an immediate mobilization of the queen's\r\narmy, and preceding that, a council of war in the fortress of Kioram\r\nto appoint a commander-in-chief and generals of division. Governor\r\nLadalmir,\" I continued, \"I thank you in the name of Lyone for your\r\nallegiance. It is very gratifying to the fleet to know that it is\r\nspared the necessity of bombarding your beautiful city.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have pledged ourselves to support our queen, to whom be freedom\r\nand victory!\" said the governor.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay!\" said the captains, Pra and Nototherboc.\r\n\r\n\"The fleet, of course, will assist in defending the city,\" I said;\r\n\"and in addition to this duty will furnish a brigade of thirty\r\nthousand wing-jackets for active service in the interior. Now, in view\r\nof this, how many men can you spare from the garrison?\"\r\n\r\nThe governor replied that he could spare ten thousand wayleals, under\r\nthe command of Pra, and five thousand bockhockids, under command of\r\nNototherboc.\r\n\r\nI ordered Astronomer Starbottle, with Flathootly as escort, to depart\r\nat once for Egyplosis, and summon to Kioram High Priest Hushnoly and\r\nthe high priestess, Grand Sorcerer Charka and the grand sorceress,\r\ntogether with such a retinue of trusty officers as would be worthy of\r\nbeing made commanders in the coming struggle. After summoning\r\nEgyplosis, they were both to go to Gnaphisthasia and summon Yermoul,\r\nlord of art, and his trusty captains, also to Kioram, and return\r\nhither without delay. \"Choose each of you,\" I said, \"a pair of the\r\nstrongest wings, and arm yourselves with revolvers. You must at all\r\nhazards evade the enemy and carry out your mission with the greatest\r\npossible speed.\"\r\n\r\nAstronomer Starbottle and Flathootly were enthusiastic at being\r\nallowed to undertake so adventurous a journey. They immediately began\r\nto prepare for, an early departure.\r\n\r\n\"Might I inquire,\" said the governor, \"what you mean by revolvers?\"\r\n\r\nWe showed him the weapons by which we had resisted the onslaught of\r\nmyriads of wing-jackets, to the fatal force of which thousands had\r\nsuccumbed. He was astonished at the invention, and said if the army of\r\nthe queen were equipped with so formidable a weapon, King Aldemegry\r\nBhoolmakar would very easily be driven from his throne, and Lyone\r\nwould be truly Queen of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the fortress of Kioram should be immediately\r\nturned into an arsenal for the manufacture of spears and revolvers,\r\nfor the use of the wayleals and bockhockids of Lyone's army. The mines\r\nwhere the metal terrelium was worked and the factories where aquelium\r\nwas elaborated from the water of the ocean were to be seized, and vast\r\nquantities of these metals sent to Kioram for the use of the entire\r\narmy, to furnish a current for the deadly spears, to be made under the\r\nsuperintendence of Professor Rackiron.\r\n\r\nAstronomer Starbottle and the redoubtable Flathootly were equipped\r\nwith splendid sets of wings worked by cells of double power. Their\r\nmagnetic spears were far-reaching and carried a current of tremendous\r\nintensity, contact with which was immediate death.\r\n\r\n\"Be jabers,\" said Flathootly, \"the fellow that touches us will foind\r\nus hornets of the first magnitude. We'll give him a touch of the\r\ncholera morbus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I entrust the despatches in your hand, astronomer,\" said I, \"and with\r\nFlathootly as escort and body-guard, I hope you will both execute your\r\nmission and return safe to Kioram.\"\r\n\r\n\"Caution and despatch will be our watchwords,\" said the astronomer,\r\n\"and you are already assured of our fidelity.\"\r\n\r\n\"In addition to your duty as couriers to Egyplosis and Gnaphisthasia I\r\ndesire you,\" I said, \"to explore the upper atmosphere, with a view of\r\ndiscovering at what height centrifugal gravity ceases to operate on\r\nbodies, and, if possible, where gravity toward Swang begins to exert\r\nits force. I wish to choose an aerial battle-field, where there is no\r\ngravity, so that our wayleals may have absolute freedom of action.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have discovered a perceptible movement toward the sun at a height\r\nof fifty miles,\" said the governor; \"at that height our wayleals cease\r\nto revolve with the earth, and therefore have no weight--but your\r\nastronomer can easily verify this fact by his own experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think our couriers will receive opposition from the king's\r\nwayleals?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I would suggest their being disguised as the king's wayleals as a\r\nmeans of safety. If they travel as wayleals of her majesty they are\r\nliable to be captured.\"\r\n\r\nThe astronomer and Flathootly made the necessary disguise in their\r\nattire as a measure of safety, each donning a leathern cuirass, highly\r\ndecorated with white-metal helmet and boots, and packing a sufficient\r\nquantity of food in a portable trunk to supply them during the\r\njourney. They bade us good-by, soaring from the deck into the gulfs of\r\nair above Atvatabar, and directed their flight to Egyplosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF WAR IN KIORAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sensation produced by the defeat of the royal fleet, the\r\ndestruction of forty of the ships, and the defection of the remaining\r\nsixty vessels to the cause of Queen Lyone, shook the nation from its\r\ncentre to circumference. It appeared incredible that one ship could\r\ndestroy so many well-armed vessels. Our terrorite guns were considered\r\ndemon powers, and such was the consternation produced by their\r\nterrible energy that, were it possible for us to use such weapons in\r\naerial battle, their appearance would alone cause the royal army to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nColtonobory was confident he could soon suppress the insurrection by\r\nvirtue of his superior force.\r\n\r\nAs for his majesty, he was beside himself with rage at the loss of his\r\nfleet. Had Admiral Jolar been alive he would have answered for his\r\ndefeat with his life. The following royal proclamation testified to\r\nthe implacable wrath of the king:\r\n\r\n     \"_His Majesty_ KING ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR _of Atvatabar to\r\n     his faithful people_:\r\n\r\n     \"Know ye, my people of Atvatabar, that the desperate\r\n     barbarian who commands the alien ship, the _Polar King_, has\r\n     not only alienated the affections of the Goddess Lyone,\r\n     thereby insulting our holy religion and our laws, but has\r\n     destroyed forty of our ships of war, and induced the\r\n     remainder of our fleet to follow his fortunes, thereby\r\n     giving him power to destroy our commerce, blockade our\r\n     harbors, and burn our cities. His success has encouraged\r\n     many who have hitherto been our faithful subjects to flock\r\n     to his standard, and the terrors of treason and insurrection\r\n     devastate our beloved country.\r\n\r\n     \"What will be thought of Lyone, who was lately our beloved\r\n     and adored goddess, who has treasonably allowed herself to\r\n     be proclaimed Queen of Atvatabar, and who is the prime cause\r\n     of all this deluge of crime, treason and apostasy by\r\n     encouraging a heretical affection for a desperate criminal,\r\n     and who dares to abuse her holy office by seeking matrimony\r\n     with a murderer? It would be impossible for this cowardly\r\n     and desperate assassin to visit our country with such\r\n     destruction were it not that she who was our goddess\r\n     sympathizes with his inhuman and infernal work. She has only\r\n     to speak the word that she has no sympathy with such a\r\n     monster, and his power will be paralyzed in a moment, and\r\n     peace restored to our unhappy country. Will it be believed\r\n     that she absolutely refuses to disown such a viper, and even\r\n     boasts of his work, and that he will shortly set her free?\r\n\r\n     \"Our prisoner, she has disregarded our clemency in holding\r\n     back the sword of justice that hangs over her head. Her life\r\n     is already forfeited by her own actions. The monster of\r\n     insurrection and apostasy must be struck in its most vital\r\n     part. Orders have been given for a full conclave of the\r\n     Borodemy, to put our fallen goddess on trial forthwith, and\r\n     if found guilty to be immediately executed.\r\n\r\n     \"The commander-in-chief of the army, Coltonobory, has orders\r\n     to attack, pursue and put to death without mercy all rebels\r\n     in arms, and arrest all sympathizers with the rebel cause.\r\n\r\n     \"Given in our palace at Calnogor in the twenty-sixth year of\r\n     our reign.\r\n\r\n                      \"ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR, _King of Atvatabar_.\"\r\n\r\nThis proclamation revealed the desperate crisis matters had reached.\r\nThe bloodthirsty king had Lyone in his power, and unless a miracle\r\nhappened nothing could save her. The fact that the flag of the queen\r\nfloated above Kioram must have added enormously to the wrath of the\r\nking, and the supreme question with us then was how to save our queen\r\nfrom a cruel fate.\r\n\r\nWhile discussing this important subject with Governor Ladalmir and my\r\nown retinue, we were agreeably surprised to learn of the arrival of\r\nthe high priest and priestess and the grand sorcerer and sorceress\r\nfrom Egyplosis. Astronomer Starbottle and Flathootly had so far\r\nevidently succeeded in their mission.\r\n\r\nHushnoly reported that all Egyplosis was up in arms for the cause of\r\nthe queen. The priestesses had formed an amazonian legion of five\r\nthousand wayleals. These would be commanded by the high priestess\r\nZooly-Soase and the grand sorceress Thoubool in equal divisions. The\r\nsacred phalanx of priests of the spiritual palace would be under the\r\ncommand of the grand sorcerer, while Hushnoly would hold himself in\r\nreadiness for a special command.\r\n\r\nWhile praising the devotion of the twin-souls, a message by telegraph\r\nwas received from Gnaphisthasia, stating that the lord of art,\r\nYermoul, was on his way to Kioram. He would travel on the wing by a\r\ncircuitous route, to avoid contact with any of the king's wayleals.\r\nYermoul would be accompanied by the chief priests of poetry, painting,\r\nsculpture, music, decoration, architecture, and dancing.\r\n\r\nNo messenger had been sent to Grasnagallipas, high priest of the\r\npalace of inventions in Calnogor, as tidings had been received from\r\nthat quarter that the priests of invention, owing to their close\r\nconnection with the seat of government, had become bockhockids of the\r\nking. The defection of Grasnagallipas was a severe blow to our cause,\r\nas he was the greatest inventor in the kingdom, and master of ten\r\nthousand magnetic bockhockids, that machine being his own invention.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ladalmir said the crisis upon which we were to deliberate\r\ndemanded immediate action, and the first step to be taken was to\r\nappoint a commander-in-chief for the army of the queen. The victory\r\nachieved by the commander of the _Polar King_ in fighting the royal\r\nnavy single-handed, and his personal sympathy with her majesty,\r\npointed out his excellency, Lexington White, already lord admiral of\r\nthe fleet, as the man of all others fit to assume the supreme command\r\nof all operations directed against the royal army to secure the\r\nliberation of Lyone and the reformation of the religion of Atvatabar.\r\n\"I therefore,\" said he, \"nominate his excellency, Lexington White,\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army of the queen.\"\r\n\r\nThe governor's proposition was received with the wildest enthusiasm,\r\nand I gracefully accepted the high honor conferred upon me.\r\n\r\nHushnoly was appointed my assistant, under the title of supreme\r\ngeneral of the army, and the list of generals included the grand\r\nsorcerer Charka, the grand sorceress Thoubool, the high priestess\r\nZooly-Soase, the lord of art Yermoul, Governor Ladalmir, Generals Pra\r\nand Nototherboc. The chief priests of poetry, painting, music,\r\narchitecture and decoration, and Professors Rackiron, Goldrock and\r\nStarbottle, Dr. Merryferry and Flathootly were also created generals\r\nof the army, being at the same time relieved from service in the\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nRear-Admiral Wallace was promoted to full command of the fleet during\r\nmy absence therefrom, with the title of admiral.\r\n\r\nAs president of the council, I spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Supreme General Hushnoly and generals of the army of Her Majesty\r\nLyone, Queen of Atvatabar, you are aware of the nature of the crisis\r\nthat calls us together and the cause to which we devote our lives and\r\nfortunes. Our beloved queen, for whom we fight, is in the hands and at\r\nthe mercy of a cruel tyrant. We may hear of her death at any moment.\r\nSuch an event would crush our hopes and blast our cause beyond hope of\r\nrecovery. We must be both bold and prudent. We must concentrate our\r\nforces to withstand the onset of the enemy. A proclamation must be\r\nissued making Kioram, which is under the protection of the fleet, the\r\nheadquarters of the army and the rallying-ground for volunteers. Our\r\narsenal in the fortress will begin at once to make revolvers, under\r\nthe superintendence of General Rackiron, for the use of our wayleals.\r\nArmed with these, one hundred thousand wayleals will be equal to half\r\na million men without such weapons.\r\n\r\n\"We must strike a mighty blow as soon as possible for the sake of\r\nLyone, our queen. Once break the power of the king, and he will be\r\nglad to sue for peace by liberating our adored idol, the pride of\r\nAtvatabar.\"\r\n\r\nThese sentiments were applauded with impetuous excitement.\r\n\r\nHushnoly caused telegraphic despatches as to the proceedings of the\r\ncouncil to be sent to Egyplosis, Gnaphisthasia, and to sympathizers in\r\nCalnogor, calling on volunteers for the army of the queen to report\r\nthemselves at Kioram without delay.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Wallace was instructed to send vessels to various points on\r\nthe coast of Atvatabar, to receive volunteers and supplies and\r\ntransmit them to Kioram with all possible speed.\r\n\r\nThe mines of precious metals of the queen, situated on the northern\r\ncoast of the kingdom, and the materials for making guns, gunpowder and\r\nterrorite, were to be accumulated at Kioram without delay.\r\n\r\nProfessor Rackiron agreed, if furnished with men and materials, to\r\nturn out sufficient hand mitrailleuses to arm one hundred thousand\r\nwayleals in less than a month. He also proposed to furnish our\r\nwayleals with magnic spears, and to arm the legs of the bockhockids\r\nwith magnic toes, so that a company of the strange animals could rout\r\na legion of wayleals. We discovered that the materials for the\r\nmanufacture of terrorite existed in abundance in Atvatabar, and as the\r\nsecret of this substance was still ours, we were in a position to work\r\nfearful havoc on the enemy.\r\n\r\nBefore the council broke up the most encouraging news was received\r\nfrom our agents throughout the kingdom that the enrollment of\r\nvolunteers for our cause was proceeding with great rapidity, and a\r\nhundred thousand men would arrive in Kioram within a week from the\r\ndate of our proclamation. Hushnoly was appointed general of\r\nvolunteers, in addition to his rank as supreme general of the army.\r\nGeneral Yermoul and his colleagues would command the contingent from\r\nGnaphisthasia, consisting of fourteen thousand wayleals.\r\n\r\nWhile thus discussing the details of our army organization, Astronomer\r\nStarbottle and his body-guard, Flathootly, arrived at the fortress,\r\nhaving safely escaped all perils in making a very hazardous journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REPORT OF ASTRONOMER STARBOTTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI congratulated our couriers upon their safe return from a successful\r\nexpedition. The astronomer made the following report of his journey:\r\n\r\n\"Following our instructions to bear despatches to Egyplosis and\r\nGnaphisthasia, and at the same time make such astronomical and\r\nmeteorological observations as might be valuable to military\r\noperations in Atvatabar, we rose to a considerable height in the air\r\nafter leaving the _Polar King_. We were still under the influence of\r\nthe earth's revolution, moving with Atvatabar two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles an hour from east to west. We found the atmosphere of equal\r\ndensity, no matter how high we ascended, showing it to be a\r\ncontinuation of the denser strata of the outer air pressing into the\r\nearth by way of the open poles. It fills the hollow shell of the earth\r\nas an elastic ball, pressing equally on every part of the interior\r\nsurface. Notwithstanding its mobility, it partakes of the revolution\r\nof the earth, hence the particularly serene climate of Bilbimtesirol\r\nand the absence of trade-winds in the region of greatest motion, which\r\ncorresponds to the torrid zone of the outer sphere. The only winds are\r\nlocal disturbances, sometimes excessively violent, caused by the\r\nirregularities of the earth's surface and the consequent unequal\r\ndistribution of heat and cold. Besides the general serenity of the air\r\nthere are other reasons why the interior planet is really the only\r\ntrue world where human flight is a complete success.\r\n\r\n\"We found that at a height of fifty miles the gravity caused by\r\ncentrifugal motion is exactly counterbalanced by the attraction of the\r\ncentral sun overhead. At a height of sixty miles, if the wings remain\r\nmotionless, we perceptibly ascend with a slowly increasing motion\r\ntoward the sun, while the centrifugal gravity slowly lessens, owing to\r\nthe lesser circle of space traversed, the attraction of Swang as\r\ngradually increases, and nothing but the strength of our wings\r\nprevented our falling into the fires of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Our chief discovery was the fact that there exists a belt of air at a\r\ndistance of between fifty and sixty miles above the earth, extremely\r\ncold, in which there is no weight, and all objects therein float,\r\nindifferent to the presence of the sun above or earth beneath. We saw\r\na distant globe hanging in this region of very small size, and through\r\nthe glass we could see mountains, rivers and seas thereon, but no\r\ntraces of cities or human life.\r\n\r\n\"During our stay in this imponderable region Flathootly expressed his\r\nsatisfaction by grotesque evolutions. He would fly, moving his legs as\r\nif he were skating on ice, and again plunging as though he were diving\r\ninto the sea. Then he would fly upward feet foremost, as though he\r\nwere falling toward the sun.\r\n\r\n\"'Shure it's foine fun,' he said, 'to shtand upside down, flyin' an'\r\nlaughin' at the same toime.'\r\n\r\n\"'Take care,' I said, 'and don't fall upward.'\r\n\r\n\"'How can I fall upward when the ground's below me?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"'The earth below you has no attraction at this height,' I said; 'but\r\nthe sun is exerting its influence upon us. If we go any higher up\r\nwe'll be drawn into the fires of the sun and roasted alive.'\r\n\r\n\"'Be jabers, if that's so, I'll get down an' walk, an' you can fly\r\naround as much as you loike,' said Flathootly.\r\n\r\n\"'If you descend you'll be arrested and executed as a spy. Remember,\r\nwe're in an enemy's country,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'I'll tell you what I'll do then,' said he; 'now that I've got me\r\nsiven-leagued boots on, I'll jist go down an' jump from wan mountain\r\ntop to another.'\r\n\r\n\"Time would not permit us to stay longer in our high altitude,\r\nconsequently we stretched ourselves on the abyss of air and swept\r\ndownward to Egyplosis.\r\n\r\n\"'Our flight was exultant and swift. We soared over mighty ranges of\r\nmountains and swept into wide valleys with the ecstasy of birds. What\r\na splendid fact to communicate to the outer world--that man, denied\r\nfor untold ages the power of flight, may now inhabit a world of\r\nincomparable beauty, where it is easier to fly than to walk and a\r\nthousand times more enjoyable! The powers of the body and the raptures\r\nof the soul are not in themselves limited. It is simply a question of\r\nenvironment. No sooner do we inhabit a new environment than both body\r\nand soul expand themselves and fill the greater amplitude as easily as\r\nthat more restricted one. Give the world, weary with ennui, a fresh\r\njoy, and see how eager its enjoyment thereof, how voraciously it\r\nfeasts on the newly-found delight.\r\n\r\n\"We descended to the level of the mountain peaks, and, sure enough,\r\nFlathootly, taking his stand on a lofty crag, would flap his wings and\r\nsail to the next mountain like an albatross. When alighting on one of\r\nthe peaks he frightened an immense bird from its nest on a cliff. It\r\nwas the seemorgh, a bird of prey, as large as six eagles, with wings\r\nmeasuring twenty feet from tip to tip. It ferociously flew at\r\nFlathootly as he tried to escape it, and caught him with its claws,\r\nfastening its strong beak in the back of his neck.\r\n\r\n\"It was a perilous position for my companion.\r\n\r\n\"I flew to his rescue. He was badly frightened, and kept shouting,\r\n'Kill the baste!' The bird being on Flathootly's back, rendered him\r\npowerless to cope with it. Suddenly the bird let go its grip of his\r\nneck and took hold of his head in its claws, with the idea of carrying\r\nhim off to its eyrie. Coming behind the monster unseen, I managed by a\r\nwell-directed blow to transfix him with my magnic spear. The seemorgh,\r\nwith wide-distended wings and head falling limp on its breast, slowly\r\nrevolving, descended to the earth, the first enemy to fall on land at\r\nthe hands of the invader.\r\n\r\n\"Flathootly now avoided the mountains. He had a narrow escape, but,\r\nexcepting an ugly wound in his neck, was otherwise unscathed.\r\n\r\n\"We continued our flight to Egyplosis, dimly visible in the vault\r\nbefore us. We continued to traverse the inner curve of the planet,\r\nAtvatabar surrounding us on all sides except that part of the sphere\r\nabove us which was concealed by the brilliancy of Swang.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the uniform heat and density of the lower strata of air,\r\nevery mountain top was covered with foliage. We saw many mansions of\r\nthe Atvatabarese sculptured out of the solid rock and surrounded with\r\nnoble forests of tropical vegetation. We flapped our wings thirty\r\nmiles above Atvatabar, which lay, with its mountains, forests, lakes,\r\ncities, temples and dwellings, beneath us like a map.\r\n\r\n\"We had flown for six or eight hours when a feeling of hunger\r\nadmonished us to partake of food. The tin trunk, which was our\r\ncommissariat department, had been towed behind us by means of a rope\r\nduring the entire journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I MOUNTED THE TRUNK AND PROPOSED THE HEALTH OF HER\r\nMAJESTY, LYONE, QUEEN OF ATVATABAR.]\r\n\r\n\"'Flathootly,' said I, 'let us call a halt for refreshments.'\r\n\r\n\"'With all my heart,' said he; 'but how are we to howld the trunk up?'\r\n\r\n\"'Let us rise to the height of fifty miles again,' I replied, 'and\r\nthen it will stand on the air alone, like ourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"'You're a wise man, sorr,' said he. 'It's an illigant idea that we'll\r\nadopt immediately.'\r\n\r\n\"Accordingly, we were soon once more in the region of no weight, where\r\nwe stood in the air as on land, Flathootly on one side of the trunk\r\nand I on the other, to dine on its contents.\r\n\r\n\"Flathootly, opening the lid, brought forth some cold venison, which\r\nhe coolly laid on the air beside us, saying, 'Shtand there now till\r\nyou're wanted.' The venison quietly floated up against the side of the\r\ntrunk, that being the only force of gravity acting upon it. In like\r\nmanner he tossed around us a cold roast fowl, several varieties of\r\ncooked vegetables, and some rich puddings. He also produced several\r\nbottles of squang, the tokay of Atvatabar. These he flung downward,\r\nbut every bottle, after falling half a mile or so, slowly ascended,\r\nand the entire bottles came back to us in a close cluster, as though\r\nunwilling to leave us.\r\n\r\n\"It was a novel feast. We closed the lid of the trunk and spread a\r\nnapkin thereon, and at once began our repast. Flathootly rapidly\r\nsecured the floating dishes, and the food was demolished as easily as\r\nthough we stood on _terra firma_. I pulled a pudding off my back, and\r\nFlathootly took from his neck the knives and forks that had clustered\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\"The wine proved excellent. I mounted the trunk and proposed the\r\nhealth of Her Majesty Lyone, Queen of Atvatabar, and the empyrean rang\r\nwith the enthusiasm invoked by the toast.\r\n\r\n\"Flathootly proposed the health of our noble master, His Excellency\r\nLexington White, the conqueror of the fleet. The air once more echoed\r\nits response to our hurrahs.\r\n\r\n\"We might have rested, and even slept, on the impalpable air, but duty\r\nforbade us any such luxury. We repacked our trunk and proceeded\r\nstraight to Egyplosis, then but two hundred miles away. We arrived\r\nsafe, and, handing the high priest, Hushnoly, your despatch, hastened\r\non to the palace of art at Gnaphisthasia. We again succeeded in\r\neluding the vigilance of the king's wayleals, thanks to our speed and\r\ndisguise, and delivering your despatch to the grand priest of art\r\nYermoul, in Gnaphisthasia, returned forthwith to Kioram.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn less than a week, as measured by the time bells of Kioram, the\r\nships began to arrive with troops from various parts of the coast of\r\nAtvatabar, bringing volunteers for either branch of the service of her\r\nmajesty. In ten days one hundred thousand volunteers had arrived, and\r\nthese were quartered in the city, pending their equipment as wayleals\r\nand bockhockids. As might be expected, a great many were deserters\r\nfrom the royal army, and these were of great assistance in organizing\r\nthe troops, being already skilled in the tactics of aerial warfare.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rackiron had turned the entire fortress into an arsenal of\r\nwar. Fires blazed everywhere for forging guns and magnic spears, and a\r\nthousand hammers were shaping the limbs of bockhockids. The department\r\nfor making ammunition was busiest of all, furnishing the elements on\r\nwhose efficiency depended success or defeat.\r\n\r\nA vast quantity of hand mitrailleuses, or gigantic revolvers, were\r\nmade, and being of but little weight, these blew showers of bullets\r\nfrom magazines attached to the tubes. Each wayleal carried a thousand\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nThe cell in the case of the wayleals had to furnish a double current,\r\nviz., the current that moved the wings and the death-dealing current\r\nof the spear. For each bockhockid two powerful cells were necessary,\r\none for the rider and the other to work the bockhockid he rode or flew\r\nupon. The strongest cell was contained in the body of the mechanical\r\nbird, which moved both its wings and legs, and also furnished its\r\nclaws with a deadly current, so that when a detachment of bockhockids\r\ndashed into a mass of wayleals, legs foremost, the greatest possible\r\nhavoc could be made with the least possible risk to the mounted\r\nriders.\r\n\r\nThe object of having each cell separate in the case of the bockhockids\r\nwas apparent. In case a mounted wayleal got unhorsed he was able to\r\njoin the wayleals, or infantry, having the same equipment as they.\r\n\r\nOur superiority in arms when compared with the royal army, which\r\npossessed only magnic spears and shields, was apparent.\r\n\r\nOf course, the enemy also made the legs and claws of the bockhockids\r\nmagnic spears in themselves.\r\n\r\nIt seemed remarkable that a people so inventive, and who possessed the\r\nbest of all means for manufacturing firearms, should not have thought\r\nof a better device than their naval air guns. It was but a further\r\nillustration of the fact that the keenest minds are constantly\r\ncolor-blind to the simplest combinations visible to lookers-on while\r\nthey are pursuing their elaborate researches.\r\n\r\nBut the royal army, if inferior in arms, possessed the superiority of\r\nnumbers. It outnumbered us three to one.\r\n\r\nOur total forces consisted of 175,000 wayleals and 42,000 bockhockids,\r\nmaking a total of 217,000 troops, which included 5,000 amazons.\r\n\r\nWe at first expected a much larger army, believing the priests of\r\ninvention, under Grasnagallipas, would certainly espouse the cause of\r\nthe queen, but it was a terrible blow to our enthusiasm when we\r\nlearned that the priests of invention, making a total of 50,000\r\nwayleals, had joined the royal army and would fight against their late\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\nCalnogor being the headquarters of the royal army, it would have been\r\nparticularly dangerous for the priests of invention to have espoused\r\nour cause, surrounded as they were by the enormously more powerful\r\nenemy. To our loss, they had chosen to continue part of the army of\r\nthe king, which at the lowest computation numbered half a million men.\r\n\r\nThe king seemed strangely reluctant to begin the attack, although he\r\nknew the extent of our forces in Kioram. It was evident the protection\r\ngiven the city by the fleet allowed us to complete the arming and\r\ndrilling of our forces without molestation.\r\n\r\nSupreme General Hushnoly reported that, thanks to the indefatigable\r\nenergy of General Rackiron and his colleagues, Generals Starbottle,\r\nGoldrock and Flathootly, assisted by Generals Charka, Yermoul, Pra and\r\nNototherboc, he had been able to fully equip the wayleals with\r\nmitrailleuses, wings, electric spears and uniforms. The bockhockids,\r\nin addition, were mounted on mechanical birds that could either fly,\r\ntrot or walk with tremendous speed.\r\n\r\nI instructed Hushnoly to make his appointment of officers without\r\ndelay, as we might take the field any moment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rackiron informed us that he was hard at work on a portable\r\nterrorite gun for aerial warfare. He hoped to have a battery of these\r\nguns ready in time to decide the war in our favor. I thanked the\r\ngeneral for his extraordinary exertions, and informed him I felt sure\r\nof his success. With terrorite guns we would be invincible.\r\n\r\nOur spies, who had been despatched in all directions, informed us that\r\nthe royal army was in a state of activity not inferior to our own. A\r\ndaily review was being held in the air above Calnogor, and it was\r\ndiscovered that Coltonobory was about to make a descent on our ships,\r\nparticularly to seize the _Polar King_, and by thus silencing her\r\nguns, have Kioram and the army of the queen at his mercy. The plan was\r\napproved of by the king, and might be put in operation at any moment.\r\n\r\nThis was most important news, and we decided to take the initiative at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n\"We will attack the enemy even if he is a million strong,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Everything calls for an immediate advance,\" said Hushnoly.\r\n\r\nWe also learned from trusty couriers that Lyone had been brought\r\nbefore the Borodemy, and the legislative assembly in full conclave,\r\nafter hearing the evidence, had found her guilty of treason, impiety\r\nand sacrilege to her faith, of treason to the king, and had, by\r\nencouraging insurrection, caused her adherents to take up arms against\r\nboth king and law, thereby endangering the lives and property of the\r\ninhabitants of the kingdom. There was no one to recommend Lyone to\r\nmercy, and she was condemned to death. The king had already signed her\r\ndeath-warrant.\r\n\r\nShe might be executed any moment!\r\n\r\nIt was a dreadful crisis to contemplate. Our first duty was to save\r\nthe life of our queen at any sacrifice. I at once called a council of\r\nwar to consider this all-important question. We had only assembled\r\nwhen a royal courier arrived at the fortress with an important\r\ndespatch addressed, \"To His Excellency Lexington White,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Insurrectionary Army at Kioram.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nI VISIT LYONE IN CALNOGOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hastily opened the despatch, which read as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"His Majesty King Aldemegry Bhoolmakar of Atvatabar wishes\r\n     to inform His Excellency Lexington White, commander-in-chief\r\n     of the insurrectionary army mobilized in Kioram, that Her\r\n     Holiness Lyone, late Goddess of Atvatabar, has been tried\r\n     before a full conclave of the Borodemy on the charge of\r\n     sacrilege, apostasy, and insurrection. Her holiness has been\r\n     found guilty and is now under sentence of death. His\r\n     majesty, of merciful intent, wishes it to be known that he\r\n     will pardon her holiness on this condition, viz.: That the\r\n     insurrectionary army lays down its arms forthwith, and the\r\n     wayleals separate and depart to their respective abodes;\r\n     that his excellency, the commander-in-chief, and his\r\n     generals surrender themselves to his majesty as prisoners of\r\n     war, to be tried and punished as military law dictates. This\r\n     surrender to include that of the admiral of the fleet and\r\n     the ships under his command.\r\n\r\n     \"On no other condition whatever will mercy be extended to\r\n     her holiness, and should this offer be temporized with or\r\n     rejected nothing can save the late goddess from the sword of\r\n     justice.\r\n\r\n     \"Dictated at the palace in Calnogor, in the twenty-fifth\r\n     year of his majesty's reign.\r\n\r\n                                          \"ALDEMEGRY BHOOLMAKAR.\"\r\n\r\nThe king's communication was received with a sensation of contempt and\r\ndismay. The thought of surrender was in itself preposterous, but when\r\nwe thought that our rebellion would drive a sword into the heart of\r\nLyone, the awful idea struck us dumb with horror!\r\n\r\nThe king possessed our proudest and most precious soul as hostage, and\r\nhe was cowardly enough to sacrifice her as his most deadly blow to the\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was appalling.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we,\" I cried, \"continue the fight, now that we know it is our\r\nqueen we fight against, that it is our arms that will murder her?\"\r\n\r\n\"We certainly do not murder her,\" said Hushnoly; \"and yet this\r\nunexpected crisis paralyzes me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king will not dare to murder the queen,\" said the grand sorcerer;\r\n\"and if he does----\"\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer suddenly checked himself; the mere contemplation of such\r\nan event was overpowering, yet he seemed, of all others, the most\r\ncomposed. His eyes shone with a strange fire that I had not hitherto\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"I am satisfied,\" said Governor Ladalmir, \"that unless we lay down our\r\narms and submit ourselves to his mercy, which means death to every one\r\nhere, the fate of the queen is sealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said the high priestess Zooly-Soase, \"that his excellency,\r\nthe commander-in-chief, should, if possible, obtain an order from the\r\nking permitting him to visit her majesty, and advise her of the entire\r\nfacts of the situation, and then act as she commands. If she asks us\r\nto lay down our arms and surrender ourselves as the price of her\r\nliberty, there is none, I think, who would be so faithless as to\r\nrefuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said the grand sorceress, \"approve of your proposal. I am\r\nwilling to surrender myself to save the life of the late goddess.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all willing to sacrifice ourselves if need be!\" shouted the\r\nentire council with generous and chivalrous enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"I will go,\" said I, \"and see Lyone, as you propose, and upon her\r\ndecision will depend our future action.\"\r\n\r\nA courier was immediately despatched under a flag of truce to the\r\npalace at Calnogor, with the message that before his majesty's\r\ncommunication could be replied to, the commander-in-chief of the army\r\nof the late goddess desired to have an interview with her majesty, to\r\ndecide upon a final answer thereto, and to request a royal passport\r\nnot only admitting him to the presence of Lyone in the fortress at\r\nCalnogor, but also permitting his safe return to Kioram.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Hushnoly, \"the queen herself may be so confident in the\r\nsuccess of her cause that she will overlook any danger to herself. It\r\nwould be a signal success to save her without our own surrender, but\r\nthat is impossible until we defeat the royal army.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you, grand sorcerer?\" said I. \"Do you think my mission will\r\nbe successful as regards the life of Lyone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already foreseen this crisis,\" said he; \"but I believe the end\r\nwill be triumphant.\"\r\n\r\nHis majesty, in reply to my despatch, sent me a royal passport that\r\nadmitted me to the fortress to converse with Lyone, and which would\r\nprotect me until my return to Kioram.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her majesty,\" said the grand sorcerer, \"not to fear the king;\r\nthat we will save her, even should she nobly disdain to accept our\r\nsurrender for her life.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you propose to save her life in case she forfeits it?\" I\r\neagerly inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you,\" he replied, \"for occult knowledge can only be\r\napprehended by the initiated. Every great reform requires its martyr,\r\nand it may be that the queen will be our martyr, no matter what we\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nAn audible groan escaped from the lips of all. Was it possible that\r\neven should we surrender we could not save the life of our adorable\r\nleader, and that to surrender would involve all in a common ruin? Was\r\nthere ever in human history so great a crisis? I began to doubt the\r\nsorcerer's knowledge of the future. At the same time I felt that he\r\nalone could guide us in that hour of peril.\r\n\r\n\"Sorcerer,\" I cried, \"for the love of Lyone, for the glory of our\r\ncause, tell me what to do! What shall I say to the queen? How shall I\r\nadvise her to act for her own safety as well as ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not advise at all,\" said he. \"Let the queen act for herself, and\r\nthat will be the best solution of the difficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But should she insist on sacrificing herself, where would be our\r\ntriumph?\"\r\n\r\n\"The triumph will be assured,\" said he, \"although to win our cause\r\nwill require the greatest sacrifice to be made.\"\r\n\r\nI began to think that Lyone and the sorcerer understood each other,\r\nand that her life would in any case be saved from the violence of\r\ndeath; and, taking this hopeful view of the situation, I departed for\r\nCalnogor, escorted by Flathootly and the astronomer.\r\n\r\nAs we swept toward the metropolis of Atvatabar I wondered if I would\r\nbe permitted to make the journey in safety. Was the passport of the\r\nking but a _ruse de guerre_ to entrap me?\r\n\r\nI noticed here and there, as we neared the city, detachments of the\r\nroyal wayleals, some suspended in the air, and others being drilled\r\nin globular masses in anticipation of the coming struggle.\r\n\r\nWhen within ten miles of Calnogor a party of scouts intercepted us,\r\nwho demanded to see our passports. The leader examined the royal\r\ndecree with great minuteness, and only allowed us to proceed with\r\napparent reluctance. I had reason to fear treachery, as I had but\r\nlately fought my way out of the country.\r\n\r\nAt length arriving above the royal fortress, we rapidly descended to\r\nthe court-yard and inquired for the governor.\r\n\r\nWith what feelings of excitement I awaited my interview with Lyone! In\r\nwhat state would I find her, and how would she solve the riddle, a\r\ndestiny that seemed impossible of solution?\r\n\r\nThe governor, accompanied by his armed staff, approached me, declaring\r\nhow glad he was to be able to permit an interview with Lyone. His\r\nmanner was altogether too suspiciously cheerful, and his body-guard\r\nsurrounded us closely.\r\n\r\nI hastened to assure the governor that my visit was made under the\r\nprotection of the king, and showed him the royal decree. \"I have\r\ncome,\" I said, \"to have an interview with her majesty upon the crisis,\r\nand that being accomplished, the royal mandate will secure me a free\r\ndeparture to Kioram.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can certainly see the ex-goddess,\" said the governor, \"but you\r\nhave no right to address her as her majesty, for such a title is high\r\ntreason to their majesties, the king and queen of Atvatabar. As to\r\nyour being free to leave the fortress again, I must confer with his\r\nmajesty in that matter, as you are my prisoner until the king commands\r\nyour release.\"\r\n\r\nWas this a plot to capture me?\r\n\r\nI was too anxious to see Lyone to think of my own safety just then,\r\nand requested the governor to lead me at once to her apartments.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me,\" said the governor, leading the way into the fortress. We\r\npassed along corridor after corridor until we arrived at a heavy gate\r\nof bronze, which the governor himself unlocked. We thereupon entered a\r\nspacious antechamber, severely furnished with large oaken benches on\r\nthe marble floor.\r\n\r\nI requested Flathootly and the astronomer to remain in the antechamber\r\nwhile I passed through another door unlocked for me by the governor.\r\n\r\nI found myself alone in a spacious and finely decorated apartment, the\r\ngilded cage of Lyone. There were luxurious couches, and receptacles\r\nfor books, and painted tapestries on the walls, and in the centre of\r\nthe floor stood an aquarium, the home of strange animals and plants,\r\nfrom which rose a vase of gold that held a bouquet of the rarest\r\nflowers. The floor was covered with a semi-metallic carpet resembling\r\nlinoleum. I sat down to await the coming of Lyone.\r\n\r\nPresently the embroidered tapestry concealing the entrance to another\r\nchamber was moved aside, and the pale and breathless figure of Lyone\r\nstood before me. She came toward me, robed in a loose white silk gown.\r\nHer arms were outstretched, and her face wore an air of indescribable\r\nnobility and tenderness. I rushed forward and caught the glorious\r\nfigure in my arms. It was fitting that our holiest emotions should at\r\nfirst find expression in a mutual deluge of kisses and tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF LYONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the ecstasy of our meeting had somewhat subsided I informed Lyone\r\nof the dreadful crisis in our affairs. I pointed out that to save her\r\nlife the king required her army to disband itself, and her leaders to\r\ndeliver themselves up as rebels and insurrectionists, to receive\r\npunishment for their so-called offences.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, \"notwithstanding the fact that we can defeat the royal\r\narmy in pitched battle, yet to save your precious life we are willing\r\nto surrender ourselves to his majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think would life be worth to me,\" said Lyone, her\r\neyes flashing fire, \"with my dearest friends slain, my cause ruined,\r\nand my soul covered with the shame of remorse, defeat and the disgrace\r\nof having purchased my miserable life by the death of the noblest of\r\nsouls? I will go to the scaffold alone. You will conquer, and will\r\navenge my death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sweet goddess!\" I cried, \"you will not thus sacrifice yourself. What\r\nwill victory be worth if you, for whom we fight, are not our proudest\r\ntrophy? What avails the triumph of our cause if there remains no queen\r\nto possess the triumph? Your life is our life, your death our\r\ndestruction. With you to fight for, any company of leaders will be\r\nsuccessful. Let us surrender ourselves to make you free.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can never be,\" replied Lyone, \"that you must suffer, one hundred\r\nsouls for but one. I am that one, and the cause can more easily suffer\r\nthe loss of one soul than the loss of all. That the soul may again\r\npossess freedom is worthy many a martyr. I only regret I have but one\r\nlife to give for this blessed cause. I counsel you to depart and carry\r\non the war you have so bravely begun, and in your hour of triumph\r\nremember Lyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no cause if there is no Lyone,\" I pleaded. \"Do not be your\r\nown enemy; accept the condition of freedom so freely offered you, and\r\nperhaps even we may still find some means of escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king, I know,\" said Lyone, \"would much prefer your death to mine.\r\nHe is exasperated at the loss of the fleet, and that, too, at the\r\nhands of strangers. Nothing would give him greater joy, and nothing\r\nsuch fame in the eyes of the nation, than to put yourself and your\r\nsailors to death. My capture and your present visit are but the\r\nfulfilment of his plot to destroy you. He thinks you will never allow\r\nme to be sacrificed, and so hopes for your annihilation. But in this\r\nhe will be disappointed. In this terrible trial I have eaten my heart\r\nout. Without you, and without our faithful comrades, life would be\r\nless than worthless. This crisis can only be solved by heroic\r\nmeasures. I have decided for you all. Go!--go and avenge my death!\"\r\n\r\nI saw that Lyone had firmly steeled her soul for the sacrifice,\r\ntremendous at it was, and in the presence of such heroism it seemed\r\nsacrilege to again offer our less worthy lives for a life such as\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nBut a resolve so unsupportable agonized me. I clasped the divine girl\r\nin my arms in a transport of love and horror, and implored her again\r\nand again to accept life while it was offered her.\r\n\r\nWe stood beside the aquarium in the centre of the apartment, close to\r\nthe vase of gold filled with flowers. Lyone, in a dazed state, reached\r\nfor a flower, and in doing so touched the vase, and in a moment fell\r\ndead upon the floor!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYONE REACHED FOR A FLOWER AND IN DOING SO TOUCHED THE\r\nVASE AND IMMEDIATELY FELL DEAD UPON THE FLOOR!]\r\n\r\nI cannot dwell upon the horror of the scene. I rushed to the door\r\nof the apartment, and stood in the outer chamber, where waited my\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the fortress came forward to explain that I was his\r\nprisoner until he had heard from the king whether or not I should be\r\npermitted to leave the prison. I raised my spear, and with one blow\r\ntransfixed the dog at my feet. He never spoke again!\r\n\r\nThe taking off of the governor was accomplished with so little\r\ndisturbance that we passed through the body-guard, which was assembled\r\nin the outer corridor, without interference.\r\n\r\nThe situation was war!\r\n\r\nWas it really true that our hope was dead, that our jewel, the glory\r\nof our cause, was lying cold and lifeless in her prison?\r\n\r\nI was stunned with the first shock of the scene. I could only cry out,\r\nas though she were still alive, for her radiant soul to come and share\r\nour mutual bliss.\r\n\r\nBut when it clearly dawned upon me that the being for whose freedom I\r\nhad resolutely labored had become the victim of her murderers, that I\r\ncould never again enfold her beauty with my love, however ardent or\r\ntender, I was petrified with horror.\r\n\r\nMy immediate comrades, to whom I communicated the tidings, grew white\r\nwith the appalling news.\r\n\r\nThe one cry was, \"Could Lyone, the idol of her army, the goddess of\r\nher people, be indeed dead? Was the voice that could conjure such love\r\nand devotion hushed forever?\"\r\n\r\nLeaving a guard to watch over the body of the goddess, I set out for\r\nKioram.\r\n\r\nBarely escaping arrest at the hands of several wayleals, we arrived\r\nsafely at the fortress. It was our wings and spears, and not the\r\npassport of the king, that saved us.\r\n\r\nThe council in Kioram, on hearing of the death of the queen, grew\r\nexcited. The one desire in the hearts of all had been to save Lyone's\r\nlife--but, alas!\r\n\r\nI despatched a messenger to the king, charging him with the murder of\r\nthe queen, and stating that I should exact retribution at his hands\r\nfor the foul deed. I warned him not to do any injury to the person of\r\nher majesty, but deliver her dead body to the guard we would send, who\r\nwould convey it to Egyplosis.\r\n\r\n\"This is a wound that infuriates me,\" said the grand sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"It is the work of the jealous Koshnili and the murderous Bhoolmakar,\"\r\nsaid I; \"and dearly will they answer for it! I must return at once to\r\nCalnogor, and take charge of the body for honorable sepulture.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it better for your excellency to remain at the head of the\r\narmy,\" said the grand sorcerer, \"and allow me to undertake the removal\r\nof the body of the queen to Egyplosis. By keeping her death a secret\r\nfrom the army you will be able to defeat Coltonobory, and bring the\r\nking and Koshnili to justice. I shall delay the obsequies of the queen\r\nuntil victory is assured.\"\r\n\r\nI agreed to this proposition, being anxious to bring the king to\r\njustice, and thereupon relieved General Charka of his command of the\r\n21,000 bockhockids, giving him a guard of 100 wayleals, and requested\r\nhim to proceed at once to the fortress of Calnogor, and, demanding the\r\nbody of Lyone, bear it to Egyplosis for honorable sepulture.\r\n\r\nThe grand sorcerer, who had anticipated the refusal of Lyone to accept\r\nliberty at the price demanded, but did not apprehend her sudden death,\r\nhad, during my absence, assisted at completing the organization of the\r\narmy. I gave his command of the right wing of the army to Sir John\r\nForbes, Captain Adams accepting a subordinate command.\r\n\r\nSupreme General Hushnoly had fully armed the various battalions with\r\nmitrailleuses and electric spears, and had furnished all with electric\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nI instructed Hushnoly to mobilize the army at once and order an\r\nimmediate advance on Calnogor. All Kioram was alive with warlike\r\npreparations. The various generals and captains, accompanied by their\r\naides-de-camp, flew over the city, calling their troops to arms. Both\r\nwayleals and bockhockids, soaring into the air, formed themselves into\r\nimmense living globes, and in the hollow centre of each flew the\r\ncommanding general and his subordinate officers. In less than an hour\r\nthe entire army lay marshalled in the air, and Supreme General\r\nHushnoly called me to review our forces.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent sight. High over Kioram stretched a line of\r\nenormous spheres composed of wayleals and bockhockids arranged in the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n           THE ARMY OF HER MAJESTY QUEEN LYONE.\r\n\r\n      HIS EXCELLENCY LEXINGTON WHITE, _Commander-in-Chief_.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL SIR JOHN FORBES, commanding the right wing of 21,000\r\n     bockhockids, as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Legion of Art, commanded by General Yermoul.\r\nPhalanx of Poetry--Vice-Gen.

The\r\namazons were dressed similar to the priests of Egyplosis--that is, in\r\npale brown soft-leather tights, high boots emblazoned with scales of\r\nwhite metal, heavy spider-silk tunics, ornamented with beautiful\r\nembroidery and held close to the figure by a belt. The knapsack held\r\nthe magnic cell, dynamo and wings, and also furnished the current for\r\ntheir spears.\r\n\r\nAs each wayleal required ample space for the movement of his or her\r\nwings, it will be seen that each living globe was of immense size, and\r\nthe entire army became of enormous proportions as it lay stretched\r\nupon the air. I assumed supreme command as commander-in-chief, with\r\nFlathootly as special aide-de-camp, and gave orders for each globe to\r\ndouble up its wayleals, so that in each case there would be two\r\nglobes, the outer or fighting force and the interior or reserve force.\r\nIn the centre of each living shell was placed the commissariat\r\ndepartment and the medical, musical and commanding staffs.\r\n\r\nThe death of Lyone had been kept a secret. The bands of each army\r\nbegan to play the \"March of Lyone,\" and at the word of command the\r\nvast-flying mass of armed men moved grandly forward to Calnogor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF CALNOGOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong ere we reached Calnogor we discovered the royal army already\r\nmarshalled to meet us. It lay above the city in globes of wayleals and\r\nbockhockids still more prodigious than ours. It was composed of three\r\narmies, ranged one above the other, and each army being equal in\r\nnumbers to our own. Thus, forming a solid parallelogram of amazing\r\nmagnificence, the royal army awaited our onset. Its bockhockids,\r\nformed in ten globes of ten thousand in each, and led by\r\nGrasnagallipas, the lord of invention, were the flower of the army,\r\nand occupied a central position, where possibly they would do the\r\ngreatest damage to us. High overhead in a chair of state, supported by\r\ntwenty wayleals, sat Coltonobory, commander-in-chief of those immense\r\nlegions that were ready to do battle for the defeat of the cause of\r\ntheir late goddess and the honor of their king.\r\n\r\nThe sight of two such armies of winged gladiators sweeping toward each\r\nother in revolving globes was one of breathless interest. The\r\napproaching fight was a question of life or death to both combatants.\r\nDefeat to Aldemegry Bhoolmakar meant possibly the loss of crown and\r\nkingdom, and our defeat meant the annihilation of the party of reform\r\nand the cause of Lyone. We were eager to begin the fight without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nTo obtain greater freedom of action, I led the army up into the region\r\nwhere there was no gravity. The movement was followed by a similar\r\nmovement on the part of the royal armies, who rose like a swarm of\r\nlocusts to meet us. The noise of so many wings in motion was like that\r\nof a roaring storm, and formed an inspiring accompaniment to the music\r\nthat rang upon the sunlit air.\r\n\r\nHere, fifty miles above the white city beneath, both armies closed\r\nupon each other. There was a fearful yell of \"Bhoolmakar!\" answered by\r\nas loud a shout of \"Lyone!\"\r\n\r\nOur army was literally buried in the centre of the enemy. The\r\nimpetuous priests of Egyplosis and the no less eager priestesses\r\nperformed prodigies of valor.\r\n\r\nOur mitrailleuses were a complete surprise to the enemy. Thousands of\r\ntheir wayleals were killed ere they could deliver a blow with their\r\nspears.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable slaughter on both sides, but the enemy depended\r\nlargely on their magnic spears and shields, while we handled our guns\r\nwith terrible effect.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer army under Hushnoly suffered greatly by the\r\ndemoralization caused by the enemy's bockhockids under Grasnagallipas.\r\nThe terrible legs of those machines destroyed the military formation\r\nof our wayleals, producing a continuous panic, and permitting the\r\nenemy's wayleals to work a ghastly slaughter in their broken ranks. In\r\nrevenge our bockhockids with their more deadly weapons literally tore\r\ntheir globes to pieces. Notwithstanding our superior arms, the greater\r\nnumbers of the enemy made them a match for us.\r\n\r\nThe rushing of wings, the explosions of the machine guns, the clashing\r\nof spears and the yells of the combatants made a scene of infernal\r\nhorror. As the focus of battle swayed hither and thither, it left\r\nbehind a trail of blood, dead and wounded bodies, broken wings, spears\r\nand revolvers. The _debris_ of the battle simply floated out on the\r\nair, veritable clouds of disaster. Irregular masses of dead and\r\nwounded wayleals and broken bockhockids floated in heaps amid pools of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nThe enemy could only succeed by stabbing, whereas our wayleals were\r\nscorpions whose guns were fatal. With the points of their spears they\r\nmade great havoc in our battalions. But as long as our ammunition\r\nlasted their formations were immediately shrivelled up.\r\n\r\nColtonobory began to mass his army in the form of an immense\r\noutspreading hemisphere of the form of an open umbrella. His intention\r\nwas to enclose us on all sides, and so if possible devour us. I at\r\nonce ordered the army to take the form of a cone, each legion being a\r\nsegment thereof, whose apex was formed of bockhockids, and whose base\r\nwas wide circles of wayleals. With a blast of the trumpet I drove the\r\nentire army like an enormous javelin right through the heart of the\r\nfoe, tearing a yawning chasm, half a mile in diameter, in his ranks!\r\n\r\nWe lost fully two thousand men in this movement, and the foe over ten\r\nthousand in killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, paralyzed by the onset, became consolidated into three or\r\nfour immense globes. In front of these they placed their bockhockids,\r\nwhose monstrous limbs alone could keep our spears at a safe distance.\r\nIt was the intention of Coltonobory to ram us with the cohorts led by\r\nGrasnagallipas and his bockhockids.\r\n\r\nHastily re-forming our broken ranks as before, I ordered a flank\r\nmovement, rapid and decisive. Our bockhockids plunged into a\r\ntremendous mass of wayleals. Into the chasm thus made in the ranks of\r\nthe enemy General Zooly-Soase threw her amazons, protected on either\r\nside by the legion of priests of Egyplosis under Gerolio. The\r\npriestesses, whose spears were particularly long and powerful, did\r\nterrible execution. The enemy was for a time panic-stricken as the\r\nglorious girls made their successful onset. Their dramatic beauty and\r\nthe flash of their spears made a scene of imposing grandeur.\r\nColtonobory, recovering from his surprise, ordered his bockhockids to\r\nthe centre of the fight. To prevent the sacrifice of the priestesses\r\nby overwhelming odds I sent the bockhockids of art to their\r\nassistance. These swept to the rescue like a flight of eagles, and the\r\nempyrean echoed to the roar of the combat.\r\n\r\nThe fighting now became general. The sunlit heavens seemed filled with\r\nthe ferocity of war. The discharge of guns, the yells of wayleals, the\r\ntrumpet signals of the commanders, the crash of swords and spears, the\r\nceaseless motion of wings, and the long trail of dead and wounded\r\ncombatants that followed the fight like the _debris_ of a comet, was a\r\nsight but rarely beheld by human eyes.\r\n\r\nEach army seemed so equally balanced--the king's army had the\r\nadvantage in numbers and our own the advantage in weapons--that\r\nneither party could yet claim a victory. Further fighting seemed\r\nuseless until some new tactics were employed; therefore I gave orders\r\nfor a cessation of the battle, and caused flags of truce to be\r\nhoisted.\r\n\r\nBoth armies indeed required food and repose, and the wounded required\r\nimmediate attention. The enemy was no less anxious for a truce than\r\nourselves, consequently all fighting ceased and both armies withdrew.\r\nSeveral miles apart sentinels were placed on guard on outposts in the\r\natmosphere, and our wayleals threw themselves upon the air in various\r\nattitudes of repose.\r\n\r\nIn company with Generals Hushnoly, Ladalmir, Gerolio, Zooly-Soase,\r\nThoubool, Charka, Yermoul, Starbottle and Goldrock, I visited the\r\nscene of the battle.\r\n\r\nHow ghastly the realities of war! There floated irregular piles of\r\ndead and wounded bodies, from which poured many a trickling stream of\r\nruddy life, which formed immense cloud-pools of blood surrounding each\r\nghastly pile. The heaped-up masses of the dead would vibrate, as some\r\npoor suffocating wretch struggled in his last agonies. Dr. Merryferry\r\nand his assistants hastily took possession of the wounded, and\r\nministered to their necessities. Water was supplied them from the\r\nleathern bags of water that formed part of the commissariat supplies.\r\n\r\nI ordered a detachment of wayleals to separate the living from the\r\ndead, and bear the wounded to Kioram for immediate attention.\r\n\r\nThe saddest sight of all was a cluster of fifty beautiful priestesses,\r\nembracing one another in the long caress of death. They had been slain\r\nwith the magnic spears, so happily there were no gaping wounds from\r\nwhich the life-blood flowed. Ardsolus and Merga lay dead where the\r\nfight was hottest, both slain at once.\r\n\r\nThe dead and wounded twin-souls were sent to Egyplosis as quickly as\r\npossible, and the process of clearing the air of the havoc of war was\r\ncarried out both by the enemy and ourselves with the greatest\r\ndespatch.\r\n\r\nThe losses of the enemy were four times greater than ours, owing to\r\nthe tremendous execution done by our gigantic pistols. The royal\r\ntroops presented in ghastly groups every possible posture of the human\r\nbody that could be created by rage, pain, fear or madness.\r\n\r\nHow I wished some eloquent historian could have floated through that\r\nabyss of horror on distended wings, and, pen in hand, describe its\r\ndramatic desolation and terror. Clouds of vultures and the seemorgh\r\nwere devouring the dead bodies, and, as they fought for choice\r\nmorsels, flapped their wings in pools of gore. Many of the combatants,\r\nincluding some of my own sailors, were drowned in globes of blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nVICTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wayleals rested and slept outstretched upon the air close to the\r\nscene of battle. Not having any weight as regarded external objects,\r\nthey mutually attracted each other, and to obtain freedom and rest\r\nwithout being crushed together into suffocating masses of men, they\r\nwere formed into companies of one hundred each, with their feet\r\npressing against solid cylinders of spears. Mutual gravity was\r\nsufficient to hold them together, and each wayleal spread himself upon\r\nthe air, as upon a bed of down, enjoying luxurious repose.\r\n\r\nI had slept I know not how long, in company with the leaders of our\r\narmy, when I was awakened by Flathootly, who informed me that a trusty\r\nmessenger from Grasnagallipas, lord of invention and general of the\r\nking's bockhockids, desired to see me as bearer of an important\r\ndespatch from his master.\r\n\r\nThe messenger, saluting, handed me the following document:\r\n\r\n     \"_To His Excellency_ LEXINGTON WHITE, _Commander-in-Chief of\r\n     the Army of Queen Lyone, from Grasnagallipas, General of the\r\n     Royal Bockhockids, Greeting:_\r\n\r\n     \"General Grasnagallipas begs to report that he and his\r\n     bockhockids have ever been in sympathy with the late\r\n     goddess, but were prevented from espousing her cause by the\r\n     overwhelming presence of the royal army in Calnogor. To show\r\n     his detestation of the horrible act of criminal cowardice on\r\n     the part of his majesty, he offers his sword and command of\r\n     bockhockids to the cause of the late adorable goddess and\r\n     queen of Atvatabar, and on the acceptance of such assistance\r\n     by your excellency will at once leave the ranks of the royal\r\n     army and enter that of her late majesty, to fight for the\r\n     sacred cause and assist in punishing a perfidious king.\r\n\r\n                                                 GRASNAGALLIPAS.\"\r\n\r\nThe loss attending the withdrawal of the priests and priestesses to\r\nform a guard of honor to the illustrious dead was more than\r\ncompensated for by the re-enforcements under Grasnagallipas, to whom I\r\nsent a message of gracious acceptance of his services.\r\n\r\nThe army being fully aroused for conflict, had the satisfaction of\r\nwelcoming re-enforcements from two opposite directions, viz., the\r\nfifty thousand bockhockids under Grasnagallipas and the terrorite\r\nbattery under command of General Rackiron.\r\n\r\nAs was expected, the departure of the bravest general in the royal\r\narmy was the signal for a renewal of hostilities, and Coltonobory, mad\r\nat the serious defection of his troops, at once assumed the offensive.\r\nHe had received a large recruitment of wayleals, and felt as\r\nformidable as ever. His army swept down upon us with warlike music\r\nrolling like thunder, and cries of \"Bhoolmakar!\" The king himself,\r\nhaving dealt us his most terrible blow, was a witness to the onset of\r\nhis hosts. He sat aloft in a golden palanquin, borne on the shoulders\r\nof his followers, with a body-guard on either side.\r\n\r\nThe advance guard of the enemy consisted of several regiments, armed\r\nwith our own hand mitrailleuses, taken from prisoners. These did a\r\nterrible execution among our wayleals.\r\n\r\nGrasnagallipas, anxious to undo the injury he inflicted on us during\r\nthe first battle, and emulous of the prowess of our own forty thousand\r\nbockhockids, plunged headlong amid the foe, creating a panic wherever\r\nhis gigantic birds descended. He fought like a demon, neither asking\r\nnor giving quarter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rackiron, having got his terrorite battery in position, was\r\neager to check the advance of the enemy by saluting him with a few\r\naerial torpedoes. There was some delay incidental to the first actual\r\noperations of a hastily-constructed battery, but the daring ingenuity\r\nof the professor overcame every obstacle. Each gun, supported by fifty\r\nmen, possessed a solid foundation from which to direct its operations.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, though harassed by our bockhockids, had worked into the\r\ncentre of our army by sheer weight of numbers. Our wayleals, having\r\nexhausted their ammunition, had to fall back on their electric spears,\r\nand at times were obliged to retire in confusion. At this juncture a\r\nshell of terrorite exploded among the foe with thrilling effect,\r\ndestroying at least two hundred bockhockids.\r\n\r\nColtonobory, who evidently attributed the disaster to an explosion of\r\ngunpowder in his own ranks, closed up the broken columns and renewed\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THIS JUNCTURE, A SHELL OF TERRORITE EXPLODED AMONG\r\nTHE FOE WITH THRILLING EFFECT, DESTROYING AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED\r\nBOCKHOCKIDS.]\r\n\r\nThree explosions in rapid succession, right in the centre of the\r\nenemy, caused the greatest consternation, and produced a frightful\r\ngap, where but a moment before the air was thick with an armed host.\r\n\r\nGenerals Yermoul, Gerolio, Ladalmir and Grasnagallipas plunged with\r\ntheir bockhockids into the living cavern produced by the torpedoes,\r\nand with their spears mowed down thousands of the panic-stricken\r\nwayleals.\r\n\r\nAnother terrorite shell, thrown in the direction of the king,\r\ndestroyed a few hundred of his protectors and induced his majesty to\r\nseek safety in immediate flight.\r\n\r\nNot wishing to lose so important an enemy, I ordered General\r\nFlathootly and the second legion of fletyemings to start in hot\r\npursuit of the royal party and bring me back the king, dead or alive.\r\nFlathootly, delighted with his mission, started off at once in pursuit\r\nof Bhoolmakar.\r\n\r\nThe terrorite battery proved our most effective weapon in castigating\r\nthe enemy. I could not thank Professor Rackiron sufficiently for his\r\ngreat genius and mechanical skill in so rapidly perfecting his\r\nweapons, which were modelled on the plan of the guns belonging to the\r\n_Polar King_. Every discharge proved a blast of destruction to the\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nThe deadly missiles wrought a fearful slaughter, steadily decimating\r\nthe ranks of the royal army, which had no similar weapons with which\r\nto retaliate upon us.\r\n\r\nThe frightened hosts, constantly changing their focus, left behind\r\nthem vast heaps of the dead and wounded and globes of floating blood.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the first brigade of fletyemings, led by General\r\nStarbottle, in eagerly pursuing the enemy dashed through a pool of\r\nblood three feet in thickness, and every wayleal emerged dripping with\r\ngore.\r\n\r\nColtonobory, finding further resistance useless, at once surrendered\r\nhimself and his army to our mercy.\r\n\r\nMy brave wayleals, flushed with victory, saluted me with cries of\r\n\"Long live Lexington White, King of Atvatabar!\"\r\n\r\nBut what was success now without the one priceless soul to share my\r\ntriumph?\r\n\r\nDid ever glory so grand and defeat so terrible so mingle themselves in\r\nhuman experience?\r\n\r\nMy wayleals, now for the first time hearing of the death of their\r\nqueen, would have torn Coltonobory to pieces had I not protected him.\r\n\r\nI knew he was personally innocent, and my wayleals were already in\r\npursuit of the king.\r\n\r\nWe entered Calnogor in triumph. I heard on all sides a wail of\r\nlamentation for Lyone, mingled with applause for the conqueror.\r\n\r\nIt was a scene in which conquest and misery, rapture and failure, life\r\nand death, were indissolubly united.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nREINCARNATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grand sorcerer Charka and his guard had with reverend flight borne\r\nthe body of their goddess Lyone to the palace of souls, mourning the\r\ndeath of their adored, who had been so precious, so beautiful, so\r\nholy.\r\n\r\nThe high priestess and the grand sorceress, together with the priests\r\nand priestesses of Egyplosis, on hearing of the death of Lyone,\r\ndeparted at once for Egyplosis, to mourn the death of their goddess.\r\n\r\nLyone was dead!\r\n\r\nAh me! what was triumph then, without my soul of souls to share its\r\ndelights? The blessed cup of joy, quivering to the brim, was about to\r\ntouch my yearning lips when it was dashed aside by a treacherous hand.\r\nWell might the crownless Bhoolmakar laugh in whatever damnable retreat\r\nhe had retired to! His revenge was complete.\r\n\r\nOh, the pity of it! The young, the adorable, the divine soul who was\r\njust about to remount her throne to receive a purer adoration from her\r\npeople; she who was to be queen of Atvatabar, slain treacherously,\r\nwithin sight of the Bormidophia, wherein she had so long been\r\nworshipped.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me to remain longer on the field of battle. I\r\nwanted to fling myself on that once happy form and kiss her death-cold\r\nlips!\r\n\r\nI left Coltonobory and his surrendered army in the hands of the\r\nsupreme general Hushnoly, and started at once for Egyplosis. As my\r\nwings devoured the leagues of air I thought, was this the climax for\r\nwhich I fought? I flew along with none to share my torture. My heart\r\nwas rent wide open, and in my agony I rolled upon the air as I flew,\r\nfor brain and soul seemed an ocean of fire.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Egyplosis full of anguish. With quivering lips and\r\nburning tears I staggered into the portal that led to the subterranean\r\npalace where I knew my loved one was laid. I silently entered the\r\nmagnificent abode of the sorcerer, horror-stricken with despair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, beyond the labyrinth I heard a golden sound, the sound of\r\nthat blessed bell that once before rolled its waves of delight over my\r\nspirit. I stood leaning against a pillar, dissolved in its bewitching\r\nmoans, luxuriating in the Agapamone of music breathed from the\r\ndelirious bronze. I heard wafted from the mysterious temple the\r\nrefrain of thousands of voices chanting a ritual of love and peace.\r\nThe multitudinous sound seemed so soft and so thrilling, so powerful\r\nand so holy, that I was eager to know if such burden of love was the\r\nsorrowing passion of the twin-souls in honor of their dead goddess.\r\n\r\nI saw through the open doors of the temple a moving throng of\r\ntwin-souls, swaying in masses hither and thither, with naked feet on\r\nthe aquelium floor. On every forehead burned an electric star, giving\r\na spectral flush to the scene. That was the singing multitude I had\r\nheard, the hierophants of the holy soul.\r\n\r\nAs my eyes grew accustomed to the objects before me, I saw the\r\ninterior of the temple, on whose sculptured walls and roof roses woven\r\nof smouldering electric fires revealed their burning bloom. Wires of\r\nplatinum, terrelium, and aquelium had been woven into a filagree of\r\nroses, with leaves and stems made red hot by the electric current.\r\nHigh above the sculptured dado rose strange windows of illuminated\r\nglass, in colors sad and brilliant, made visible by thousands of\r\nelectric lights hidden in the sculptured recesses behind each window.\r\nThe subject of each jewelled pane was a tableau of reincarnation, in\r\nwhich the figures of sorcerers and magicians, robed in splendid\r\nattire, gave life to beings that had died.\r\n\r\nThe frieze was one continual blaze of color, formed also of enamelled\r\nglass emblazoned with life-sized processional figures and illuminated\r\nwith incandescent lights.\r\n\r\nIn a distant part of the temple, on a terrelium pedestal, I again saw\r\na monster of gold, with a terrible head and outstretched wings.\r\n\r\nAs I surveyed this stupendous figure, I discovered that it held in\r\nits fore paws an immense helix of terrelium wire, ten feet in length\r\nand nine feet in diameter. One end of the wire was joined to ten\r\nthousand wires, whose extremities, terminating in terrelium wands,\r\nwere held by the twin-souls. Each priest held a wand in his right\r\nhand, and each priestess a wand in her left, and their disengaged arms\r\nwere wound around one another's waists.\r\n\r\nThe other end of the voluminous wire forming the helix terminated in\r\nthe rivet of an enormous spring that held a circular rheotome close to\r\nthe circular mouth of the helix.\r\n\r\nOn a pedestal level with the upheld battery, reached by a spiral\r\nstairway, stood the grand sorcerer Charka, robed in tissues of white\r\nsilk and golden embroidery. An assistant priest turned a wheel that\r\nmoved a screw point toward the spring of the rheotome. The moment the\r\nscrew point touched the spring, the circular plate over the heart of\r\nthe helix began to vibrate audibly. Another turn of the screw, and a\r\nvital thrill filled the temple with its sonorous music.\r\n\r\nI then knew that all that mysterious structure with its terrelium\r\nwires was an immense spiritual battery, charged with the life and love\r\nof ten thousand souls. The vital fluid, generated in the yearnings of\r\nideal love, flooded the helix with its vitality and induced a\r\nmagnetism of life that made the rheotome vibrate with emotion, until\r\nthe whole temple shook with the thrilling sound.\r\n\r\nThe priests and priestesses sang their ritournels of passion and love,\r\nand the grand sorcerer waved his wand over the monster's head. It was\r\nthen the thought of Lyone filled my soul with a terrible yearning.\r\n\r\nWhere was her hapless body? Was this feast of passion that I beheld\r\nher obsequies, or could it be some occult incantation to raise her\r\nfrom the dead?\r\n\r\nThe thought fired my brain with madness! Oh, that it might be possible\r\nfor her to live again, if only for one hour, that she might hear of\r\nvictory! All at once I seemed to know that Lyone was laid in the heart\r\nof the helix held by the hehorrent. I knew, oh, I knew that the\r\nspectacle I beheld was the ceremony of reincarnation. I knew that the\r\ngoddess was being swathed with currents of life from her votaries. How\r\nI blessed those living batteries, so faithful in their glorious work!\r\nHow I blessed the adorable sorcerer who conducted this precious\r\nministry of life, who focussed the love of thrilling souls upon the\r\nperson of their goddess!\r\n\r\nI stood transfixed to the floor, watching with straining eyes those\r\nflamens of life perform their ritual of reincarnation. The air of the\r\ntemple grew warm as blood, and infinitely holy. Soft and piercing\r\nmusic rose from unseen chambers of the temple, which, mingling with\r\nthe blessed storm of life that beat upon the mouth of the helix,\r\nseemed to whirl away my senses.\r\n\r\nThe first circle of souls around the dragon comprised the votaries of\r\nBishano, or Sorcery; Hielano, or Magic; Nidialano, or Astrology;\r\nPadamano, or Soothsaying.\r\n\r\nThe second circle embraced the adepts of Niano, or Witchcraft;\r\nRedohano, or Wizardry; Biccano, or the Oracle; Kielano, or Augury;\r\nTocderano, or Prophecy; Jiracano, or Geomancy; Jocdilano, or\r\nNecromancy.\r\n\r\nThe third circle embraced the hierophants of Orphitano, or\r\nConjuration; Orielano, or Divination; Pridano, or Clairvoyance;\r\nEcthyano, or Mesmerism; Cideshano, or Electro-Biology; Omdolophano, or\r\nTheosophy; Bishanamano, or Spiritualism.\r\n\r\nHow shall I describe the spell of that hour? Glimmering figures, clad\r\nin robes of finest gossamer of the rarest colors, powderings and\r\nembroiderings, sang the songs of pained and enraptured sensibility.\r\n\r\nThey loved, they wept, they supplicated Harikar!\r\n\r\nI saw twin-souls embrace in infinite tenderness, and again with\r\necstatic enthusiasm. It was a sea of supernatural emotion. It was an\r\nabyss of affection, filled with a whirlwind of bold, delicate,\r\nenormous love.\r\n\r\nA _religieuse_ of Tocderano shouted, \"She will live again!\"\r\n\r\nA priest of Biccano sang, \"She will be born again of mystical,\r\nchivalrous love!\"\r\n\r\nAs the enraptured host sang of life and love, I felt a million\r\nexaggerations of the delicacies of emotion. I felt as though fanned\r\nwith warm winds blowing over wildernesses of flowers. I heard the\r\nmultiplied splendor of bells, roaring like the soft vociferations of\r\nfar-off tropic seas. I heard music ineffably tender and sublime,\r\nwailing its intoxicating melodies. I saw strange illuminations\r\ndissolve in never-ceasing explosions of color on the glorified\r\nwindows. I saw upon the floor endless arabesques of twin-souls,\r\nfantastically entangled and unrolled.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the temple shook with an explosion of sound that seemed the\r\nconcentrated madness of drums and organs and bells; the roaring of the\r\nrheotome grew deafeningly louder, mingling with a strange shivering\r\nsound, such as is produced by the suddenly transfixed wheels of a\r\nflying locomotive, tearing the metals into a hissing blaze. From the\r\nmouth of the hehorrent streamed a blaze of fire. I looked where the\r\nsorcerer stood----\r\n\r\nHeavens and earth! He was holding Lyone in his arms, alive from the\r\nliving battery! Lyone, the peerless soul of souls, alive once more and\r\ntriumphant over death!\r\n\r\nThe temple whirled around me rapid as fire, and I fell to the ground\r\ninsensible with joy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nLEXINGTON AND LYONE HAILED KING AND QUEEN OF ATVATABAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary scenes attending the reincarnation of Lyone had left\r\nme, when I returned to my senses, exhausted with emotion. It was\r\ngloriously true that she who was the Supreme Goddess, she who had\r\nsuffered death in the fortress of Calnogor, had been restored to life\r\nby the powerful necromancy of the sorcerer and his college of\r\ntwin-souls.\r\n\r\nI rushed forward in presence of the entire congregation and embraced\r\nin turn the radiant Lyone and the beloved Charka.\r\n\r\nI took her living figure in my arms. She was in a limp, tranquil\r\ncondition, yet happily alive. The happy priests and priestesses\r\nshouted with enthusiasm: \"Long live Lexington and Lyone, King and\r\nQueen of Atvatabar!\"\r\n\r\nIt was a blissful moment to us both. The future, that had lain under\r\nthe terrors of death, now smiled again. I gazed upon my beloved's face\r\nwith unspeakable tenderness. I saw that she smiled at me sweetly.\r\n\r\nHer apostasy was victorious, but who could have supposed that\r\nmartyrdom and reincarnation were the path to glory? She had exchanged\r\nthe crown of the goddess for that of a queen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAVENS AND EARTH! HE WAS HOLDING LYONE IN HIS ARMS,\r\nALIVE FROM THE LIVING BATTERY! LYONE, THE PEERLESS SOUL OF SOULS,\r\nALIVE ONCE MORE AND TRIUMPHANT OVER DEATH.]\r\n\r\nHanding my precious burden back to Charka again, I addressed the\r\ncongregation as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Priests and priestesses of Egyplosis, wayleals and amazons of the\r\nsacred and victorious army, I thank you from the depths of my heart\r\nfor your loyal salutation, but I particularly thank the grand sorcerer\r\nCharka, and you his hierophants, for your glorious restoration of her\r\nmajesty to life, king and crown, thus defeating the cowardly crime of\r\nthe ex-king. By reason of our victory, their majesties King Bhoolmakar\r\nand Queen Toplissy of Atvatabar are deposed from the throne, and his\r\nex-majesty, by reason of his great crime, is condemned to death.\r\n\r\n\"The causes that led to this revolution are already known to you. The\r\ntime was ripe for a reform in Egyplosis. Regulation and not\r\nsuppression will be our aim, and they who have helped us to this great\r\nconquest will not go unrewarded.\r\n\r\n\"After her tremendous experiences, the queen will require a season of\r\nabsolute rest to restore her to perfect health. I will intrust the\r\ntask of establishing a reform of Egyplosis in competent hands,\r\nassisted by a council of your own representatives. The present crisis\r\nis too overwhelmingly happy to permit me to say more to you. On\r\nanother occasion I will thank you more effectively.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was received with enthusiastic applause.\r\n\r\nOn a litter, supported by six twin-souls, Lyone was tenderly borne out\r\nof the temple. We departed amid joyful peans of music, our pathway\r\nbeing strewn with flowers. We reached the supernal palace, and saw\r\nfrom every roof floating the flag of Lyone, in token of our victory.\r\n\r\nIn her palace, on a couch of pale green velvet, lay the reincarnated\r\nform of Lyone, filled with a sense of luxurious rest. The experiences\r\nof the past few days demanded a period of profound repose. Her face\r\nwore a blessed and triumphant smile. She had paid with suffering for\r\nthat Nirvana of joy. With reincarnation, or rather resurrection, had\r\ncome a holier transfiguration of form and face. She was still too weak\r\nphysically to discuss at length the great changes that had come to her\r\nor to the history of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\nShe was the symbol of the more sensitive souls of humanity, who,\r\ncapable of intense suffering and delirious rapture, must needs\r\npurchase all their joys with heart-rending experiences. The culture\r\nthat comes from agony is our most priceless possession, and brings the\r\nsoul to every feast, as well as the body. The body, daily slain by\r\nsuffering, is resurrected with a purer flesh, and receives a\r\nreincarnated soul fitted for ideal delights. It has attained a\r\nmeasure of Nirvana. It anticipates immortality by reason of suffering\r\nand love. Lyone had more than all achieved an ideal existence. Before\r\nshe would be able to return again to the realities of the world, it\r\nwas necessary that time should be given her for physical and spiritual\r\ninvigoration.\r\n\r\n\"I feel neither pain nor fatigue,\" said Lyone; \"my senses seemed\r\ndrowned in a delicious rest. You tell me that I have been dead and\r\nbrought to life again, and although I have no sense of having passed\r\nthrough the agony, I must believe you. I remember touching a golden\r\nvase of flowers in my prison, and then all became a blank until I\r\nstood with the grand sorcerer in the temple of reincarnation.\"\r\n\r\n\"That vase you touched,\" said I, \"was connected with a powerful magnic\r\nbattery, which was placed in your apartment by the king's order, to\r\nkill you. Grasnagallipas, leader of the king's bockhockids, on\r\nlearning of his royal master's treachery, immediately transferred his\r\nallegiance and important command to our army, and was mainly\r\ninstrumental in securing the victory.\"\r\n\r\n\"So our cause has triumphed,\" said Lyone; \"and what has become of the\r\nking?\"\r\n\r\n\"The king,\" I replied, \"is king no more. I am King of Atvatabar and\r\nyou are my beloved queen.\"\r\n\r\nLyone turned aside her face and wept tears of joy.\r\n\r\n\"Our marriage,\" I added, \"will inaugurate the reign of a religion of\r\nwedded love, and you will sit with me as queen on the throne of\r\nAtvatabar.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be glorious,\" said Lyone, \"but I fear our marriage will\r\nalso end ideal love and sorcery, and the Nirvana of a hundred years,\r\nthe fairest products of Egyplosis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you see now,\" I said, \"that ideal joys in the world can only be\r\nbuilt on more extensive miseries? It would be a glorious thing to\r\nbuild houses of jewels, but so long as real jewels are so rare, we\r\nmust be content with rocks. Still, there are jewels, and in Atvatabar\r\nI learn they are much more abundant than on the outer planet;\r\ntherefore it might be proper for twin-souls to walk on love's\r\nenchanted ground for a brief though definite period.\"\r\n\r\nLyone had undergone transfiguration. Beautiful as a spirit, her figure\r\nseemed plastic porcelain. Death had made more luminous the splendid\r\nsculpture of her face. As she spoke, it seemed to me that we had\r\nclosed the door on the infelicitous experiences of actual life, and\r\nwere opening the gates of a more glorious day.\r\n\r\nI informed Lyone of the arrival of the two vessels from the outer\r\nworld, and of the great services of Captain Adams and Sir John Forbes\r\nin turning the tide of battle by sea in our favor. She was delighted\r\nat the prospect of meeting fresh visitors from the outer world, and in\r\ndue time Captain Adams and Sir John Forbes and their entire ships'\r\ncompanies stood before her who was delighted with the fuller\r\nacquaintance thus made with the people of the outer world. Both the\r\ncaptains and their officers realized her ideal of exotic manhood,\r\nwhich combined stalwart proportions with intellectual benignity of\r\nface.\r\n\r\nSir John Forbes was very complimentary in his praise of the grace and\r\nbeauty of Lyone and her associates among the priestesses of Egyplosis.\r\nHe considered Lyone to possess spiritual beauty to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. The wonderful pale-gold of her complexion was in marked\r\ncontrast to the old-gold complexion of the women of Atvatabar. He also\r\npraised the splendid beauty of Zooly-Soase and Thoubool, who were\r\nindeed magnificent women.\r\n\r\nMy success encouraged the strangers to consider that conquest in other\r\nrealms of Plutusia would be an easy accomplishment, especially if\r\narmed with such weapons as those possessed by the sailors of the\r\n_Polar King_. But even admitting superiority of weapons, they thought\r\nit a marvellous thing that one small vessel with but eighty men could\r\nconquer fifty millions of people.\r\n\r\nIn my own mind I thought it possible that the _Polar King_ might\r\nconquer still greater kingdoms, and that in time I might be Plutarch\r\nof Plutusia. But in such business one realm at a time is enough. I\r\nsuggested to our visitors that there were at least twenty realms, each\r\nas large as Atvatabar, in this interior planet, that would give them\r\nopportunity for adventure.\r\n\r\n\"We also wish,\" said I, \"both the United States and England to know\r\nthat our ports are open for commerce, and foreign trade is welcome to\r\nseek our shores. We have gold enough to enrich all comers from the\r\nouter world.\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes of our visitors and their officers glistened at this\r\nintelligence. And well they might, for Atvatabar was worth a thousand\r\nrealms like Golconda or Peru. We had wealth for literature and\r\nscience, art and commerce, which rightly used would make Atvatabar the\r\nwonder of the ages, a realm of palaces and temples, the fountain of\r\nwisdom, the mother of art, and its commerce would make both the earths\r\nrich beyond the dreams of fortune. I was determined that the royal\r\nmagnificence of the thrones of all time on either surface of the earth\r\nshould be outrivalled by the supreme glory of that of Atvatabar. I\r\nknew there was an inspiration to human endeavor that magnificence\r\nalone can give, and would use my wealth to advance the happiness of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nLyone being at last fully restored to health, we determined to delay\r\nno longer the important ceremonies of our royal marriage and\r\ncoronation, not only to complete our happiness, but to really\r\nestablish the government on a personal basis so agreeable to the\r\nwishes and customs of the people.\r\n\r\nLyone's aerial yacht was made ready for the journey to Calnogor. It\r\nwas large enough to carry the captains, officers, and men of the\r\n_Mercury_ and _Aurora Borealis_, the captain, officers, and men of the\r\n_Polar King_, as well as Lyone and myself and the great officers of\r\nstate and retinue. All being safely on board, I gave the signal for\r\nflight, and in a moment we were launched on the air with tremendous\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nOUR RECEPTION IN CALNOGOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal city of Calnogor never contained such splendor, such\r\nimportance of historic event, nor such a multitude of people, as on\r\nthe occasion of the triple event of our marriage, our coronation, and\r\nthe reception of the distinguished strangers from beyond the Polar\r\nGulf. How shall the glory of that day be described? What occult power\r\nmust animate the pen that must be at once the stylus of a poet, the\r\nbrush of a painter, and the wand of a magician, to do justice to the\r\nsplendid theme?\r\n\r\nThe entire army, composed of half a million wayleals, had come from\r\nCalnogor to Kioram to escort the aerial ship containing myself, Lyone,\r\nand the distinguished strangers, together with our retinue and the\r\nsailors from America and Great Britain. On either side of the ship the\r\narmy was massed in two equal hosts, waving a million of wings. Either\r\narmy was led by a phalanx of flying bockhockids, led by Yermoul and\r\nGrasnagallipas. A body-guard of wayleals bore fifty gigantic golden\r\nsceptres, being the ensigns of sovereignty over the fifty provinces of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nAll the way to Calnogor, five hundred miles distant, the army\r\nperformed the most incredible evolutions to the measured thunders of\r\nmusic. Its legions massed themselves in ever-whirling globes,\r\nundulating all along the line of flight like monstrous serpents.\r\n\r\nAgain, mighty cones of wayleals would stream from our yacht on both\r\nsides, upward and backward, like a blaze of comet splendor.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, globes of wayleals would surround us, globe within\r\nglobe flying alternately in different directions; and we seemed to\r\nmove on the centre of another earth.\r\n\r\nTo describe the endless flight and counter-flight, the concentration\r\nand radiation of the wayleals in grand review, would be impossible.\r\nCaptain Adams and Sir John Forbes were astounded at the extraordinary\r\nevolutions possible to winged men in a world where there is\r\npractically no gravity. The army moved in Daedalian march; it was at\r\ntimes sinuous with labyrinthic movement to the sound of drums and the\r\nroar of bugles. The wayleals formed arches and crowns, conchoidal\r\nconvolutions, zones and wheels, hemispheres and globes, cones and\r\npyramids. The yacht was clothed with sublime torsions, peristaltic\r\nsplendors, and immense radiations of living bodies. It was the\r\ngrandest movement of men ever seen on earth.\r\n\r\nWe were again completely surrounded by a single globe of wayleals, in\r\nthe centre of which moved the yacht with fearful speed. The globe\r\nmoved as fast as we, and the living shell obliterated both earth and\r\nsun from, sight. Then, with a roar of artillery, the globe exploded,\r\nand lo! before us the infinite golden dome of the Bormidophia, the\r\nmarble city of Calnogor, and dense multitudes of excited people!\r\n\r\nThe city was decorated with the conquering flag of Lyone and with\r\nflowers; and the inscriptions on the triumphal arches were: \"Long live\r\nLexington and Lyone, King and Queen of Atvatabar!\"\r\n\r\nThe entire army, augmented by the allegiance of the defeated king's\r\ntroops, headed by the supreme general Hushnoly, received us at the\r\nentrance to the city.\r\n\r\nPending the reconstruction of the government, law and order were being\r\nadministered by Hushnoly, assisted by a military council consisting of\r\nall the victorious leaders.\r\n\r\nThe festivities incidental to our entry into Calnogor and the public\r\nrejoicings over the reincarnation of Lyone lasted several days. I took\r\noccasion at a reception at the royal palace to confer suitable honors\r\nand rewards on my victorious generals. I created the supreme general\r\nHushnoly a noble of the first rank under the title of Goiloor, or Duke\r\nof Calnogor, and confirmed his authority as commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy, and Zooly-Soase was also created Goiloose of Calnogor. General\r\nGerolio was created Boiroon of Swerga, an inland city, and appointed\r\nvice-commander to Hushnoly. General Rackiron was made Goiloor of\r\nSwondab, and his appointment as general of the royal artillery was\r\nconfirmed. General Ladalmir was made Goiloor of Kioram and commandant\r\nof the fortress. General Yermoul, who retired from the army, was made\r\nGoiloor of Gnaphisthasia. The grand sorcerer Charka was made Goiloor,\r\nand the grand sorceress Goiloose of Egyplosis, while Grasnagallipas\r\nwas created Boiroon of Invention and General of the Royal Bockhockids.\r\n\r\nGeneral Starbottle was made Goiloor of Savasse, a province of the\r\nkingdom, and Prime Minister of the government. General Goldrock, who\r\nwas now fully recovered from his wounded leg, was made Royal Treasurer\r\nand Goiloor of Blindis, a distant city. Dr. Merryferry was made\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs; General Nototherboc, Minister of Naval\r\nAffairs; General Pra, Chief of Police; and General Flathootly,\r\nMinister of War.\r\n\r\nI assumed the title of \"His Majesty Lexington, King of Atvatabar,\" and\r\nLyone that of \"Her Majesty Lyone, Queen of Atvatabar,\" of equal\r\nauthority and dignity to myself.\r\n\r\nI issued a decree confirming all titles and dignities for the life of\r\nthe recipient only. As a man cannot transfer his character or\r\nabilities to his children, more especially the virtues that made him\r\nfamous, so neither could he transfer his titles or dignities to\r\nposterity; and a man who had no other claims to greatness than the\r\nplumes he had borrowed from his father, should be despised for\r\nstrutting in artificial glory.\r\n\r\nThe Borodemy was maintained, and no restriction of popular or\r\nconstitutional liberty already enjoyed by the people was permitted.\r\nAll titles given to men who were simply fortunate enough to receive a\r\nmajority of votes, making them representatives of the people in the\r\nBorodemy, were abolished, and men only were honored by virtue of great\r\nservices accomplished. All members of the Borodemy were paid liberal\r\nsalaries, on the principle that a prince had no more right to an\r\nappropriation from the public purse than a legislator. All public\r\nmeasures adopted by the Borodemy were subject to the veto of the Royal\r\nCouncil, composed of the king, queen, and actual members of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI need not say that the victory of Lyone over death and the fact of\r\nour army having conquered in battle gave us unlimited power. I was the\r\nsupreme lord of Atvatabar; but, nevertheless, in the hour of triumph I\r\ndetermined to use my power for the good of the people. The sensation\r\ncaused by the return of Lyone to life had stirred all Atvatabar with\r\nfeelings of the profoundest awe and loyalty. Vast crowds of people\r\ncame as pilgrims to see their queen and offer congratulations.\r\n\r\nHad the old creed, with its worship of Lyone and Harikar, not fallen\r\nwith the success of our arms, Lyone would undoubtedly have been\r\nworshipped anew as goddess more devotedly than ever; but the\r\nrevolution being founded on antagonism of the old faith to social\r\nwelfare and the laws of nature, a new creed must necessarily take its\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe new creed of one body and one soul was based on order, truth,\r\njustice, benevolence and temperance. This I styled the Remeliora, or\r\nbetter thing to that which had gone before. The new creed gave the\r\nsoul mastery of its feelings, and love was measured by a regular\r\nthrob. Souls becoming stronger and more masculine were the better able\r\nto bear the pulsations of joy and despair. They could sustain their\r\nemotions with a cordial enthusiasm, and passion, no longer a frantic\r\nflame, became a soft and abiding fire.\r\n\r\nI appointed the grand sorcerer Pontiff of Remeliorism, giving him\r\nauthority to formulate a code of ethics that all could adhere to. With\r\nsuch a code as a solid foundation, I hoped in time to establish a\r\npurer faith than that possessing only the human soul for its deity.\r\n\r\nNot many days after our coming to Calnogor, and while still engaged in\r\nsettling the government of the kingdom, we received a visit from\r\nHushnoly and Zooly-Soase. It was with feelings of pain that we heard\r\nthe object of the supreme general's visit.\r\n\r\nWith a voice softened with emotion Hushnoly told his story. In\r\ncarrying out the reforms at Egyplosis made necessary by the success of\r\nthe army of the late goddess, a great difficulty presented itself. It\r\nwas found that, notwithstanding the fact that all of the priests and\r\npriestesses had fought for Lyone and the new faith, as against the old\r\norder of things, nearly one-half of the twin-souls were still at heart\r\nas great devotees of Harikar and hopeless love as ever, while the\r\nremaining half had renounced the practices of Egyplosis in common with\r\ntheir queen. It was found impossible to change the faith of the entire\r\npriesthood in a moment, so to speak, and many still believed that the\r\nold faith possessed fruits of self-sacrifice, culture, spirit-power,\r\nand the ideal life, such as the new state of things would utterly\r\ndestroy. Hushnoly and the high priestess were in sympathy with the\r\nadherents of the ancient faith, and they too believed in sacrificing\r\nmarital rights for the sake of the ideal existence.\r\n\r\nThe revelation of such a spiritual revolt in Egyplosis, headed, too,\r\nby the man and woman who had sacrificed so much for the cause of Lyone\r\nand myself, revealed human nature in a new light, while it astounded\r\nus. I had foolishly supposed the supremacy of the sword could carry\r\ndominion into spiritual things, and that Egyplosis was wholly\r\nconverted to the new faith, to Remeliorism.\r\n\r\nThe situation was extremely painful.\r\n\r\n\"Supreme general and high priestess,\" I said, \"both her majesty Lyone\r\nand myself are greatly indebted to your courage and support in the\r\nlate struggle; a support heroically given us in spite of your own\r\nsecret faith. Is there no way by which you might be reconciled, both\r\nof you, to the new order of things?\"\r\n\r\n\"We fear not, your majesty,\" said Hushnoly.\r\n\r\n\"Will riches, will honors not tempt you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your majesty, we cannot be tempted,\" replied he.\r\n\r\n\"You are doubtless aware,\" I continued, \"that it would be impossible\r\nfor the government to recognize, much less give support to, a system\r\nof faith for the destruction of which the war was carried on. Much as\r\nwe love you, much as we love the priests and priestesses, we cannot\r\ngive allegiance to the old faith, We cannot, we dare not countenance\r\nyour creed. It will be therefore impossible for yourselves or your\r\npeople to remain at Egyplosis, which will be the chief shrine of the\r\nnew faith hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have already anticipated all this,\" said Hushnoly, \"and do not\r\npropose even to remain in Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where do you go to?\" said Lyone, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your majesty,\" replied he, \"we have determined to take\r\npossession of the sphere Hilar, one of the untenanted spheres above\r\nus, and there create an ideal world. Thus we will relieve your majesty\r\nof all embarrassment and remove any obstacle in the way of religious\r\nor political reform.\"\r\n\r\nI was bewildered by the reply of Hushnoly, as I had never before heard\r\nof any one desiring to dwell on the wandering sphere Hilar, and begged\r\nan explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Hilar, as your majesty is probably aware,\" said Hushnoly, \"is a\r\nsphere twenty-five miles in diameter that floats in space at a\r\ndistance of fifty miles from the surface of Atvatabar. It revolves on\r\nits own axis at the rate of a mile an hour, making a complete\r\nrevolution in seventy-five hours. It also revolves around Swang once\r\nduring a hundred aerial revolutions, or in one hundred of its days. It\r\nhas tropic, temperate, and frigid zones, with perpetual ice capping\r\nits poles. It contains one ocean of irregular outline and has one\r\ncontinent. The areas of land and water are about equal. There are two\r\nmountain ranges, turning from a given centre of upheaval and\r\ndetermining the configuration of the land. There are one hundred\r\nislands in the sea and a dozen rivers on the land. In fact, it seems\r\nto be a facsimile in climate, geologic, and physiographical conditions\r\nto the outer world you have come from; and on such a sphere we propose\r\nto build a new throne for Harikar, and seat thereon another goddess\r\nlike the virtuous and glorious Lyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Lyone, \"I know who that other goddess will be--she will be\r\nthe fair Zooly-Soase.\"\r\n\r\nThe high priestess blushed in her robe of crimson silk, making her\r\ngolden beauty superb and precious. As for Hushnoly, it was evident the\r\ndestiny of his counterpart soul was already fully anticipated. Her\r\nascension to the throne of a goddess would virtually make him ruler of\r\nHilar.\r\n\r\n\"We desire, your majesty,\" said he, \"to resign our titles and offices\r\nof high priest and priestess of Egyplosis and supreme general and\r\ngeneral of the amazons of the royal army of Atvatabar. Our only\r\nrequest is that we be allowed to depart to Hilar, together with such\r\nof the priests and priestesses of Harikar as are willing to follow us\r\nthither. Also, that all new converts to Harikar desirous of emigrating\r\nto our spiritual kingdom will be secured freedom of departure from\r\nAtvatabar for all time hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nI willingly granted Hushnoly and Zooly-Soase their request, and added:\r\n\"You both shall be promptly and liberally rewarded for the great\r\nservices rendered your king and queen in time of war, as well as\r\nrecompensed for past services to the country in Egyplosis and for loss\r\nof estate in Atvatabar.\"\r\n\r\nI promised to issue a royal decree embodying all of the aforesaid\r\nliberties and bounties in favor of Hushnoly and his fair consort and\r\ntheir followers. The late high priest and high priestess, with\r\ngrateful, cordial adieus, departed from the audience-chamber.\r\n\r\nI thereupon appointed General Rackiron the commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy in place of Hushnoly, with General Gerolio the vice-commander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMBINED CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE AND CORONATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of our marriage and coronation as king and queen of Atvatabar\r\nat length arrived. The scene in the Bormidophia was of surpassing\r\nmagnificence. For the first time in history Lyone sat before the\r\nthrone of the gods not as goddess, but as queen; and I, her compeer,\r\nas king sat beside her. Lyone was attired in a loosely-fitting robe of\r\nold-ivory silk, over which was an outer network of lace formed of\r\nthread of gold, the design being a golden sun on the breast, which,\r\nwith its long streaming rays, was held together by a golden cobweb\r\nthat covered the entire figure of the queen. She also wore her belt of\r\njewels. Beside her stood a page bearing her crown as Queen of\r\nAtvatabar. For myself I had caused to be made a knightly suit of\r\ngolden armor that shone mightily as I wore it on that eventful\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe priestesses of Egyplosis, taught by a priest of decorative art\r\nfrom Gnaphisthasia, had been for some time engaged in creating a\r\ntapestry of lace, wrought with a thread of heavy bullion gold, as a\r\nbridal gift to their queen. The design took the form of a winged\r\ntwin-soul in loving converse, in the centre, surrounded by\r\nAtvatabarese arabesque--all held together by a most poetic fancy of\r\nfloral scrolls and formed of gold thread lace work. This enormous\r\npiece of work was twelve feet in width, seventy-five feet in length,\r\nand four inches in thickness. The gold used in its marvellous\r\nintricacies weighed five tons. Such was the glorious piece of tapestry\r\nthat was hung over the side of the throne, and which, reaching\r\ndownward three-fourths of its height, concealed a considerable part of\r\nthe august structure.\r\n\r\nAround us swept the amphitheatre, filled with the leaders of the army\r\nand navy, the great officers of government, and the people of\r\nAtvatabar. Surrounding the base of the throne, sat those priests and\r\npriestesses of Egyplosis who had embraced the new faith of \"one body\r\nand one soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe pontiff Charka performed the marriage ceremony when the roar of\r\nguns had subsided. He performed his august duties sustained by the\r\nsplendors of music and the adoration of the people.\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou have this woman, Lyone, Queen of Atvatabar, to be thy wife\r\nuntil death, according to the customs of our people and not according\r\nto the customs of Egyplosis?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilt thou have this man, Lexington, King of Atvatabar, to be thy\r\nhusband until death, according to the new faith of 'one body and one\r\nsoul?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I will.\"\r\n\r\nThe deed was done. Around the throne swept a cyclone of twin-souls\r\nresolved on matrimony. In their bewildering flight they became radiant\r\nwith strange transformations of feeling and gesture, and their songs\r\nsymbolized the intensity of the great crisis that had arrived in the\r\nhistory of the nation.\r\n\r\nAll around the amphitheatre rose the enormous multitude, as one soul,\r\nshouting their joy. The guns of the fortress volleyed their thunders,\r\nand the first act of the great drama ended amid the shouting of armed\r\nhosts, the singing of twin-souls, and the hosannas of the multitude.\r\n\r\nThe second scene was perhaps still more impressive. The grand\r\nchamberlain of the palace Cleperelyum had put into his phonograph\r\nbeside us a coil containing the charter of coronation. Fitting a\r\nmegaphone to the phonograph, there issued the following proclamation\r\nfrom the instrument, like a blast of music:\r\n\r\n     _Charter of Coronation of Their Majesties_ LEXINGTON _and_\r\n     LYONE, _King and Queen of Atvatabar_.\r\n\r\n     The crown and throne of the realm of Atvatabar, heretofore\r\n     possessed in the persons of their ex-majesties King\r\n     Aldemegry Bhoolmakar and Queen Toplissy, being now declared\r\n     vacant by reason of the desertion, flight, deposition, and\r\n     defeat of said ex-majesties, and said crown and throne of\r\n     Atvatabar being now possessed, both by conquest and by will\r\n     of the people, in the persons of their majesties Lexington\r\n     and Lyone, King and Queen of Atvatabar, now, therefore, we,\r\n     the priests, nobles, statesmen, and commanders of army and\r\n     navy, as representatives of the people, do hereby confirm\r\n     said possession of the crown and throne of this realm, by\r\n     placing upon the head of Lexington and upon the head of\r\n     Lyone their respective crowns as King and Queen of\r\n     Atvatabar, and do hereby render both king and queen equal\r\n     loyalty, fealty, and homage, as the true and rightful\r\n     sovereigns of Atvatabar.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\nSTARBOTTLE, _Goiloor of Calnogor, First Minister of the Government_.\r\n\r\nCHARKA, _Pontiff of Remeliorism, Goiloor of Egyplosis_.\r\n\r\nTHOUBOOL, _Goiloose of Egyplosis_.\r\n\r\nRACKIRON, _Goiloor of Swondab, Commander-in-Chief of the Army_.\r\n\r\nWALLACE, _Admiral of the Fleet_.\r\n\r\nYERMOUL, _Lord of Art, Goiloor of Gnaphisthasia_.\r\n\r\nGRASNAGALLIPAS, _Commander-in-Chief of Bockhockids_.\r\n\r\nLADALMIR, _Goiloor of Kioram_.\r\n\r\nPRA, _Minister of Police_.\r\n\r\nNOTOTHERBOC, _Minister of Naval Affairs_.\r\n\r\nGOLDROCK, _Royal Treasurer_.\r\n\r\nDR. MERRYFERRY, _Minister of Foreign Affairs_.\r\n\r\nFLATHOOTLY, _Minister of War_.\r\n\r\nGEROLIO, _Vice-Commander of the Army_.\r\n\r\nCOLTONOBORY, _Vice-Commander of Bockhockids_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WE SAT THUS CROWNED AMID THE TREMENDOUS EXCITEMENT. THE\r\nPEOPLE SHOUTED \"LIFE, HEALTH, AND PROSPERITY, TO OUR SOVEREIGN LORD\r\nAND LADY, LEXINGTON AND LYONE, KING AND QUEEN OF ATVATABAR.\"]\r\n\r\nDuring the declamation of the megaphone the pontiff Charka raised the\r\ncrown to my head, while his consort Thoubool raised the crown of the\r\nqueen to Lyone's head. We sat thus crowned amid the tremendous\r\nexcitement. The guns of the fortress shook the Bormidophia with their\r\nexplosions. The people shouted: \"Life, health, and prosperity to our\r\nsovereign lord and lady, Lexington and Lyone, King and Queen of\r\nAtvatabar!\" Men heard no sweeter music than the coronation march\r\nexecuted by a thousand instruments. I realized as I sat with Lyone\r\nbeneath the throne of the gods a portion of that immeasurable feeling\r\nof being universally exalted, universally loved, universally adored.\r\nIt is true, the fervor of idolatry for Lyone had largely subsided, but\r\nin its stead came a more perfect loyalty of soul and body on the part\r\nof priest and priestess. Souls that had balanced themselves, as it\r\nwere, on the edge of a sword, once more stood on the solid earth.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of royalty, which kings born to the purple but rarely\r\nfeel, was ours. Our sudden good fortune unveiled to us the splendors\r\nof power, and riches, and honor. The people themselves, enchanted with\r\nthe product of their own abnegation, made their obeisance to us as to\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nLyone grew perceptibly paler with the intensity of her excitement; her\r\nbreast rose and fell more rapidly, as the soarings of song told her\r\nthat her supreme realization of life and fortune as goddess had not\r\nwholly died with her apostasy, but that a new life no less glorious\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, seated on the focus of human endeavor, it thrilled me\r\nto think what power of realization I possessed for things I had\r\nconsidered impossible and unattainable. I determined that art should\r\nsound the abysses of the inexpressible and bring from thence radiant\r\nsymbols of all things, clothed with imagination and emotion. Invention\r\nwould still further extend man's empire over matter. Soul-culture and\r\nspirit-power would be cultivated in a reformed Egyplosis. Lyone,\r\nmystical and divine, would ever rule queen of hearts with the sorcery\r\nof her beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF BHOOLMAKAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Flathootly, with his command of 10,000 fletyemings, who was\r\nordered to pursue and capture the ex-king Bhoolmakar, returned to\r\nCalnogor after a month's absence to report the death of King\r\nBhoolmakar and Koshnili, together with several hundred of their\r\nfollowers, and the capture of several thousand wayleals as prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt a special interview with the general I requested him to report the\r\nstory of his defeat of the king's troops and the death of the king.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yer majesty,\" said Flathootly, \"Oi must first of all\r\ncongratulate you on ascendin' the throne of the inimy. It was the\r\nshmartest bit of work Oi've seen iver since Oi lift the other\r\nwurruld.\"\r\n\r\n\"The troops behaved nobly,\" I said, \"but I am all anxiety to hear how\r\nyou captured the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, thin, yer majesty, Oi kim up to him at a place called Gapthis,\r\nabout 1,500 miles from here, away beyant on the wild say-shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he a large force with him?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Bedad an' he had. He had a body-guard of about 5,000 wayleals, but\r\nshure, we made short work of the flyin' sojers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell me exactly what happened,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Troth, an' Oi will, yer majesty; shure our flyin' sailors are darlin'\r\nfellows! We skirmished up to the inimy until we got him between us an'\r\nthe say an' thin we fell to. The bloody rascals tried to spear us, an'\r\ndid kill about a dozen or two of the bhoys, but we touched thim up\r\nlively wid our pitchforks, an' begorra they didn't loike that at all,\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\"A wee red-faced captain called out that they were goin' to fight for\r\ntheir king to the last. 'How long are ye goin' to last yerself,\r\nsonny?' says Oi, an' afore the words were out of me mouth somebody\r\nlaid the wee fellow out as nate as a funeral. Well, we fell upon thim\r\nfront an' rear, as the sayin' is, an' be jabers, Oi killed a man wid\r\nthe first blow.\r\n\r\n\"'Walk right into thim!' Oi shouted, an' there we wor, fightin' an'\r\nslashin' an' killin' wan another as if it wor a mere matther of\r\nbusiness. If the king's sojers flew up, why, we flew up too, an'\r\nchased thim down ag'in. It was loike a pandemonium of fightin' cocks.\r\n\r\n\"There was a big fellow who made a slash at me wid his sword, but Oi\r\nlifted him on me fork, an' he very nicely showed me the whites of his\r\neyes. The best part of the performance was ould Bhooly, who had\r\nhimself in the middle of his body-guard, an', waving a toy sword,\r\nasked his kind friends to kill us.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to make a long shtory short, the inimy being very badly beaten,\r\nthrew up their arms, an' we captured the entire lot, excipt about five\r\nhundred wayleals who flew away as fast as their heels cud carry thim.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did the king conduct himself when captured?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"He came up to me, an' bowin' very nicely, offered me his sword. He\r\nsaid he was glad to surrender to a brave gineral an' hoped Oi would\r\ngive him the honors of war.\r\n\r\n\"'Be jabers, Oi will that,' said Oi; 'but that'll be afther we thry ye\r\nby coort-martial. But where's Mrs. Bhooly?' says Oi.\r\n\r\n\"'Does your excellency mean her late majesty?' said Bhooly; 'if so, Oi\r\nregret to say the unhappy fate which has overtaken both myself and my\r\ncounthry prostrated her so much that she died.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, thin,' said Oi, 'where's that other conspirator, Koshnili?'\r\n\r\n\"'Oi am here, your excellency,' said he, steppin' forward an' handin'\r\nme his sword, 'an' Oi also surrender.'\r\n\r\n\"'You do well,' said Oi, 'to give up yer sword, for it saves me the\r\nthrouble of takin' it from you.\r\n\r\n\"'An' now, me rascals,' Oi said, 'we're goin' to save the throuble of\r\nlookin' afther you by thryin' you by coort-martial. Let the coort be\r\nformed,' said Oi, 'an' bring forth the prisoners.' The king's sojers\r\nwere disarmed, an' their wings taken off, an' were assimbled in a\r\ncircle undher guard. Bhooly an' Koshnili, undher a special guard,\r\nstood in the middle of the ring.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, bhoys,' said Oi, 'fair play an' no favor. Who has got a charge\r\nagin' the prisoners?' Wid that, wan of me min stepped forward an' said\r\nthat Bhooly an' Koshnili had organized resistance to a change of\r\ngovernment an' religion, thereby blockin' the wheels of reform, an'\r\nfurthermore had conspired to murdher, an', be jabers, did murdher, her\r\nholiness the goddess, of blessed memory, who, although alive ag'in,\r\nwas undoubtedly kilt.\r\n\r\n\"When Bhooly an' Koshnili heard that the goddess was alive ag'in their\r\nknees knocked together wid fear.\r\n\r\n\"'This is a terrible charge agin' ye both,' said Oi. 'Oi don't know\r\nwhich offince is the greatest--killin' a dacent goddess or blockin'\r\nthe wheels of reform; annyhow, the wan crime is as bad as the other.\r\nWho supports this charge?' Oi added in thunderin' tones.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ivery sojer on the spot volunteered to give evidence as to the\r\nblockin' of the wheels of reform, but nobody saw the murdher\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n\"'Now,' said Oi, addressin' the prisoners, 'did yez murdher the\r\ngoddess or did yez not? By yer sowls, tell the truth. Guilty or not\r\nguilty?'\r\n\r\n\"'Guilty,' said both prisoners.\r\n\r\n\"'Thin, by yer own mouths be ye condimned,' said Oi. 'The sintince of\r\nthis coort is that ye both be beheaded on the mortal spot.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, Flathootly,\" said I, \"that you rather exceeded your duty in\r\nso hastily condemning the prisoners. You should have brought them to\r\nCalnogor for proper trial and execution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shure, Oi knew that, but, to tell yer majesty the truth, it wudn't\r\nhave added to yer credit to have ordhered the execution of Bhooly, an'\r\nso Oi took the responsibility of the whole thing on meself. Oi made\r\nBhooly an' Koshnili kneel down, an' a sojer tied their hands behind\r\ntheir backs. Then Oi ordhered a wayleal to behead thim wid their own\r\nswords. Afther some hot work the heads av both murdherers rolled on\r\nthe ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you shoot them or kill them at once with your spears?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oi considered it too aisy a death for thim. Oi didn't want thim to\r\ndie widout knowin' they were gittin' hurt.\"\r\n\r\nI forgave Flathootly his too hasty execution of the ex-king, as he had\r\nundoubtedly saved me a very disagreeable duty, and the hasty taking\r\noff of his ex-majesty prevented any demonstration in his favor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I MADE BHOOLY AN' KOSHNILI KNEEL DOWN AN' A SOJER TIED\r\nTHEIR HANDS BEHIND THEIR BACKS. THEN I ORDHERED A WAYLEAL TO BEHEAD\r\nTHEM WID THEIR OWN SWORDS.]\r\n\r\nTo assure the people of my anxiety for a popular government, I issued\r\na proclamation ordering a general election, to create a new\r\nBorodemy in place of the assembly whose members had disappeared, or\r\nwere made prisoners of war, or were dead. In thus providing for a\r\nconstitutional government, I granted the nation not only all its\r\nancient privileges, but added new and more important measures of\r\npolitical liberty.\r\n\r\nAs the revenues of Atvatabar amounted to $8,000,000,000 per annum,\r\nthere was no danger of myself or comrades of the _Polar King_ falling\r\nshort of handsome revenues.\r\n\r\nThe re-establishment of the government, the reorganization of the\r\narmy, navy, and police, together with the care of the palaces of\r\nCalnogor and Tanje and the new ritual for the Bormidophia and\r\nEgyplosis, occupied my attention for a longer period than I at first\r\ncontemplated. While these things were being accomplished I gave a\r\ngrand public reception and royal banquet to Captain Adams and Sir John\r\nForbes and the officers and seamen of the ships _Mercury_ and _Aurora\r\nBorealis_, in acknowledgment of their great services to our cause. At\r\nthe same time I did not forget to give our friends a more solid proof\r\nof my gratitude in the shape of a large bounty in gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY CONCLUDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it is right that I should conclude the history of the conquest\r\nof Atvatabar with my being crowned king of the realm.\r\n\r\nI at once assumed my functions as ruler of Atvatabar. I was supreme\r\ncommander of the army and grand admiral of the fleet. In council with\r\nthe ministers of the government appointed by the Borodemy, I caused\r\nthe adoption of many beneficent laws, calculated to make my people\r\nprosperous and happy.\r\n\r\nHushnoly soon departed, with his retinue of twin-souls, to found a new\r\nEgyplosis on the sphere of Hilar, with Zooly-Soase as goddess. It was\r\nwith great grief that I parted with these beloved friends. Hushnoly\r\nand his flock were not to be persuaded that nature herself was hostile\r\nto their esoteric practices; so, to avoid antagonism, it was best that\r\nwe should part. I promised Hushnoly that, together with Lyone, I would\r\nvisit his globe some time in the future and see how his colony\r\nprogressed. He was an enthusiast who required a great many defeats\r\nfrom fortune before he could see the fatal defects of his social and\r\nreligious system.\r\n\r\nThe grand sorcerer, as the pontiff of Remeliorism, or the ethics of\r\nnature, achieved a triumph in restoring Egyplosis to the reign of\r\norder, truth, justice, benevolence, and temperance. In time I hoped to\r\nsee the Christian faith rule the souls of those who had so recently\r\nworshipped themselves under the guise of Harikar, the universal human\r\nsoul. I was anxious to see men and women possessing that serene poise\r\nof passion that alone can sustain virile action. Lyone herself was the\r\nfirst to be convinced that the human soul, with its limitations, its\r\nnarrowness, its impatience, its selfishness, its arrogance, its\r\ncruelty, was a very inferior deity. It was true that rare ideal joys\r\nmight be purchased for a brief time under the old _regime_, but they\r\nwere only purchased at an immense price, out of all proportion to the\r\nvalue received, and their possession produced a sickly sublimity\r\ntotally unfitting the soul for the practical duties of life.\r\n\r\nCaptain Adams and Sir John Forbes, excited at my good fortune,\r\ndeclared themselves anxious, with my consent, to explore the further\r\nhemisphere of the interior planet, in the interests of science,\r\ndiscovery, commerce, and possibly conquest. They were anxious to\r\ndiscover the continents that lie above and beyond Atvatabar,\r\nsurrounded by unknown Plutusian seas, and bear to their respective\r\ncountries some signal trophies of their daring and prowess in the\r\ninternal world.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that on their return to Kioram, the _Polar King_, with\r\nmyself and Lyone on board, should sail with the _Mercury_ and _Aurora\r\nBorealis_ for the United States. The sailing of the three vessels up\r\nNew York Bay would be a historic event, and great would be the\r\ncuriosity of the American people to see the Goddess of Atvatabar and\r\nour retinue of wayleals as proof of the existence of Bilbimtesirol,\r\nthe interior world.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my dear reader, we must part for the present. By a change of\r\nplans on the part of Captain Adams, the _Mercury_, the vessel that\r\nwill bear the manuscript of my adventures in the interior world, is\r\nalready waiting to start on her voyage. I regret that many strange\r\nthings have been left unsaid. Many extraordinary experiences have been\r\nomitted, because I am desirous that this brief history of the\r\nhappiness that befell me and my devoted sailors in Atvatabar should\r\nbe published without delay, to allay the natural curiosity excited in\r\nthe outer world by the story of our discovery of Plutusia.\r\n\r\nYou may possibly feel a desire to know the future fortunes of Queen\r\nLyone and myself in a part of the world hitherto undreamed of, and\r\nwhen I again address you I hope to describe our future experiences on\r\nthe throne of Atvatabar. We purpose to apply a liberal portion of the\r\nvast wealth of our kingdom to the pursuit of invention, art, and\r\nspirituality, preserving and enlarging the existing palaces of\r\ninvention and art and the palaces of Egyplosis as institutions for the\r\ndevelopment of the soul and its attributes of spirit power. It will be\r\nour purpose to extend to the utmost limits the empire of mind over\r\nmatter in developing invention. In art, we will, by means of its\r\nmanifold radiant symbols, reproduce every idea of the soul shaped by\r\nsentiment and imagination, and in sounding the abysses of the heart\r\nexpress what is considered the inexpressible.\r\n\r\nIn spirituality, the science and art of soul and its manifestations in\r\nthe body, and after the temporary or complete severance therefrom,\r\nwill be investigated on a much wider basis than ever before, and\r\nspirit power, apart from the worship of soul as deity, will be\r\ndeveloped and elaborated into an enduring force, possessing creative\r\nenergy. What boundless empire of life will not such ideas realize, and\r\nhow entrancing the story of such discoveries in the interior world of\r\nthe soul!\r\n\r\nI may also, dear reader, request you to accompany me to other\r\nundiscovered realms of Plutusia, where, according to report, exist\r\nfairy-lands, peopled with strange, fantastic races of men and women,\r\nas well as fabulous animals, with characteristics surpassing the\r\nwildest dreams of fancy.\r\n\r\nAs shown on the map of the interior world, which forms the\r\nfrontispiece of this volume, many more continents remain yet unknown\r\nto me, to explore which will be my ambition. If the rumors I have\r\nheard of semi-spiritual men and semi-human monsters that dwell in\r\ntropical environments, where mountains rise so high that there is no\r\nweight on their summits, and where torrents of water roll upward,\r\nsweeping away villages in their path; of rocks of gold suspended in\r\nthe air; of tribes dwelling on floating islands of jewels in the\r\nempyrean, and of a thousand still stranger places and peoples, where\r\nevery phantasy of the imagination can be produced in reality by spirit\r\npower, then, indeed, the story of my adventures will develop the soul\r\nof the age with a profound delight.\r\n\r\nI therefore bid adieu to you, dear reader, in the hope of meeting you\r\nagain, to feast you with these wonders. I hope to have you accompany\r\nme on the _Polar King_, which, after a season of repair and refitment,\r\nwill most assuredly be launched for a still more adventurous voyage on\r\nthe waters of the interior sea. How many books have been written on\r\nthe discovery of the western hemisphere by Columbus, while, as yet,\r\nbut one has been written about the interior sphere, a region not less\r\nimportant than the outer earth, whose geographical features are now\r\nfor the first time revealed to human eyes! What a wonder it would be\r\nif one could travel to the moon or the planet Mars and return to the\r\nearth to tell of all that he had seen or heard on those distant\r\nspheres! Here indeed is no less a miracle that for ages two vast\r\nplanets have existed each unknown to the other, although only a\r\nthousand miles apart, with the means of communication possessing but\r\nfew difficulties to be overcome. The mutual discovery of two such\r\nworlds has opened up a future for the human race that may well strike\r\none dumb with its splendor. It has conferred on the meanest individual\r\na glory, a birthright of the spirit, as vast as the proportions of the\r\ntwin-planet. I will not further anticipate the future, and for the\r\npresent will ask you to accept from Lyone and myself a courteous\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE LOVE LETTER.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Goddess of Atvatabar, by William R.
