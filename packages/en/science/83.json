The End\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTHE GUN CLUB\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the War of the Rebellion, a new and influential club was\r\nestablished in the city of Baltimore in the State of Maryland. It is\r\nwell known with what energy the taste for military matters became\r\ndeveloped among that nation of ship-owners, shopkeepers, and mechanics.\r\nSimple tradesmen jumped their counters to become extemporized captains,\r\ncolonels, and generals, without having ever passed the School of\r\nInstruction at West Point; nevertheless; they quickly rivaled their\r\ncompeers of the old continent, and, like them, carried off victories by\r\ndint of lavish expenditure in ammunition, money, and men.\r\n\r\nBut the point in which the Americans singularly distanced the Europeans\r\nwas in the science of _gunnery_. Not, indeed, that their weapons\r\nretained a higher degree of perfection than theirs, but that they\r\nexhibited unheard-of dimensions, and consequently attained hitherto\r\nunheard-of ranges. In point of grazing, plunging, oblique, or\r\nenfilading, or point-blank firing, the English, French, and Prussians\r\nhave nothing to learn; but their cannon, howitzers, and mortars are\r\nmere pocket-pistols compared with the formidable engines of the\r\nAmerican artillery.\r\n\r\nThis fact need surprise no one. The Yankees, the first mechanicians in\r\nthe world, are engineers—just as the Italians are musicians and the\r\nGermans metaphysicians—by right of birth. Nothing is more natural,\r\ntherefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to\r\nthe science of gunnery. Witness the marvels of Parrott, Dahlgren, and\r\nRodman. The Armstrong, Palliser, and Beaulieu guns were compelled to\r\nbow before their transatlantic rivals.\r\n\r\nNow when an American has an idea, he directly seeks a second American\r\nto share it. If there be three, they elect a president and two\r\nsecretaries. Given _four_, they name a keeper of records, and the\r\noffice is ready for work; _five_, they convene a general meeting, and\r\nthe club is fully constituted. So things were managed in Baltimore. The\r\ninventor of a new cannon associated himself with the caster and the\r\nborer. Thus was formed the nucleus of the “Gun Club.” In a single month\r\nafter its formation it numbered 1,833 effective members and 30,565\r\ncorresponding members.\r\n\r\nOne condition was imposed as a _sine quâ non_ upon every candidate for\r\nadmission into the association, and that was the condition of having\r\ndesigned, or (more or less) perfected a cannon; or, in default of a\r\ncannon, at least a firearm of some description. It may, however, be\r\nmentioned that mere inventors of revolvers, fire-shooting carbines, and\r\nsimilar small arms, met with little consideration. Artillerists always\r\ncommanded the chief place of favor.\r\n\r\nThe estimation in which these gentlemen were held, according to one of\r\nthe most scientific exponents of the Gun Club, was “proportional to the\r\nmasses of their guns, and in the direct ratio of the square of the\r\ndistances attained by their projectiles.”\r\n\r\nThe Gun Club once founded, it is easy to conceive the result of the\r\ninventive genius of the Americans. Their military weapons attained\r\ncolossal proportions, and their projectiles, exceeding the prescribed\r\nlimits, unfortunately occasionally cut in two some unoffending\r\npedestrians. These inventions, in fact, left far in the rear the timid\r\ninstruments of European artillery.\r\n\r\nIt is but fair to add that these Yankees, brave as they have ever\r\nproved themselves to be, did not confine themselves to theories and\r\nformulae, but that they paid heavily, _in propriâ personâ_, for their\r\ninventions. Among them were to be counted officers of all ranks, from\r\nlieutenants to generals; military men of every age, from those who were\r\njust making their _début_ in the profession of arms up to those who had\r\ngrown old in the gun-carriage. Many had found their rest on the field\r\nof battle whose names figured in the “Book of Honor” of the Gun Club;\r\nand of those who made good their return the greater proportion bore the\r\nmarks of their indisputable valor. Crutches, wooden legs, artificial\r\narms, steel hooks, caoutchouc jaws, silver craniums, platinum noses,\r\nwere all to be found in the collection; and it was calculated by the\r\ngreat statistician Pitcairn that throughout the Gun Club there was not\r\nquite one arm between four persons and two legs between six.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, these valiant artillerists took no particular account of\r\nthese little facts, and felt justly proud when the despatches of a\r\nbattle returned the number of victims at ten-fold the quantity of\r\nprojectiles expended.\r\n\r\nOne day, however—sad and melancholy day!—peace was signed between the\r\nsurvivors of the war; the thunder of the guns gradually ceased, the\r\nmortars were silent, the howitzers were muzzled for an indefinite\r\nperiod, the cannon, with muzzles depressed, were returned into the\r\narsenal, the shot were repiled, all bloody reminiscences were effaced;\r\nthe cotton-plants grew luxuriantly in the well-manured fields, all\r\nmourning garments were laid aside, together with grief; and the Gun\r\nClub was relegated to profound inactivity.\r\n\r\nSome few of the more advanced and inveterate theorists set themselves\r\nagain to work upon calculations regarding the laws of projectiles. They\r\nreverted invariably to gigantic shells and howitzers of unparalleled\r\ncaliber. Still in default of practical experience what was the value of\r\nmere theories? Consequently, the clubrooms became deserted, the\r\nservants dozed in the antechambers, the newspapers grew mouldy on the\r\ntables, sounds of snoring came from dark corners, and the members of\r\nthe Gun Club, erstwhile so noisy in their seances, were reduced to\r\nsilence by this disastrous peace and gave themselves up wholly to\r\ndreams of a Platonic kind of artillery.\r\n\r\n“This is horrible!” said Tom Hunter one evening, while rapidly\r\ncarbonizing his wooden legs in the fireplace of the smoking-room;\r\n“nothing to do! nothing to look forward to! what a loathsome existence!\r\nWhen again shall the guns arouse us in the morning with their\r\ndelightful reports?”\r\n\r\n“Those days are gone by,” said jolly Bilsby, trying to extend his\r\nmissing arms. “It was delightful once upon a time! One invented a gun,\r\nand hardly was it cast, when one hastened to try it in the face of the\r\nenemy! Then one returned to camp with a word of encouragement from\r\nSherman or a friendly shake of the hand from McClellan. But now the\r\ngenerals are gone back to their counters; and in place of projectiles,\r\nthey despatch bales of cotton. By Jove, the future of gunnery in\r\nAmerica is lost!”\r\n\r\n“Ay! and no war in prospect!” continued the famous James T. Maston,\r\nscratching with his steel hook his gutta-percha cranium. “Not a cloud\r\non the horizon! and that too at such a critical period in the progress\r\nof the science of artillery! Yes, gentlemen! I who address you have\r\nmyself this very morning perfected a model (plan, section, elevation,\r\netc.) of a mortar destined to change all the conditions of warfare!”\r\n\r\n“No! is it possible?” replied Tom Hunter, his thoughts reverting\r\ninvoluntarily to a former invention of the Hon. J. T. Maston, by which,\r\nat its first trial, he had succeeded in killing three hundred and\r\nthirty-seven people.\r\n\r\n“Fact!” replied he. “Still, what is the use of so many studies worked\r\nout, so many difficulties vanquished? It’s mere waste of time! The New\r\nWorld seems to have made up its mind to live in peace; and our\r\nbellicose _Tribune_ predicts some approaching catastrophes arising out\r\nof this scandalous increase of population.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” replied Colonel Blomsberry, “they are always struggling\r\nin Europe to maintain the principle of nationalities.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there might be some field for enterprise down there; and if they\r\nwould accept our services—”\r\n\r\n“What are you dreaming of?” screamed Bilsby; “work at gunnery for the\r\nbenefit of foreigners?”\r\n\r\n“That would be better than doing nothing here,” returned the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said J. T. Matson; “but still we need not dream of that\r\nexpedient.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” demanded the colonel.\r\n\r\n“Because their ideas of progress in the Old World are contrary to our\r\nAmerican habits of thought. Those fellows believe that one can’t become\r\na general without having served first as an ensign; which is as much as\r\nto say that one can’t point a gun without having first cast it\r\noneself!”\r\n\r\n“Ridiculous!” replied Tom Hunter, whittling with his bowie-knife the\r\narms of his easy chair; “but if that be the case there, all that is\r\nleft for us is to plant tobacco and distill whale-oil.”\r\n\r\n“What!” roared J. T. Maston, “shall we not employ these remaining years\r\nof our life in perfecting firearms? Shall there never be a fresh\r\nopportunity of trying the ranges of projectiles? Shall the air never\r\nagain be lighted with the glare of our guns? No international\r\ndifficulty ever arise to enable us to declare war against some\r\ntransatlantic power? Shall not the French sink one of our steamers, or\r\nthe English, in defiance of the rights of nations, hang a few of our\r\ncountrymen?”\r\n\r\n“No such luck,” replied Colonel Blomsberry; “nothing of the kind is\r\nlikely to happen; and even if it did, we should not profit by it.\r\nAmerican susceptibility is fast declining, and we are all going to the\r\ndogs.”\r\n\r\n“It is too true,” replied J. T. Maston, with fresh violence; “there are\r\na thousand grounds for fighting, and yet we don’t fight. We save up our\r\narms and legs for the benefit of nations who don’t know what to do with\r\nthem! But stop—without going out of one’s way to find a cause for\r\nwar—did not North America once belong to the English?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Tom Hunter, stamping his crutch with fury.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” replied J. T. Maston, “why should not England in her turn\r\nbelong to the Americans?”\r\n\r\n“It would be but just and fair,” returned Colonel Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n“Go and propose it to the President of the United States,” cried J. T.\r\nMaston, “and see how he will receive you.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” growled Bilsby between the four teeth which the war had left\r\nhim; “that will never do!”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” cried J. T. Maston, “he mustn’t count on my vote at the next\r\nelection!”\r\n\r\n“Nor on ours,” replied unanimously all the bellicose invalids.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile,” replied J. T. Maston, “allow me to say that, if I cannot\r\nget an opportunity to try my new mortars on a real field of battle, I\r\nshall say good-by to the members of the Gun Club, and go and bury\r\nmyself in the prairies of Arkansas!”\r\n\r\n“In that case we will accompany you,” cried the others.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this unfortunate condition, and the club was threatened\r\nwith approaching dissolution, when an unexpected circumstance occurred\r\nto prevent so deplorable a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow after this conversation every member of the association\r\nreceived a sealed circular couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE, October 3. The president of the Gun Club has the honor to\r\ninform his colleagues that, at the meeting of the 5th instant, he will\r\nbring before them a communication of an extremely interesting nature.\r\nHe requests, therefore, that they will make it convenient to attend in\r\naccordance with the present invitation. Very cordially, IMPEY\r\nBARBICANE, P.G.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nPRESIDENT BARBICANE’S COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of October, at eight p.m., a dense crowd pressed toward the\r\nsaloons of the Gun Club at No. 21 Union Square. All the members of the\r\nassociation resident in Baltimore attended the invitation of their\r\npresident. As regards the corresponding members, notices were delivered\r\nby hundreds throughout the streets of the city, and, large as was the\r\ngreat hall, it was quite inadequate to accommodate the crowd of\r\n_savants_. They overflowed into the adjoining rooms, down the narrow\r\npassages, into the outer courtyards. There they ran against the vulgar\r\nherd who pressed up to the doors, each struggling to reach the front\r\nranks, all eager to learn the nature of the important communication of\r\nPresident Barbicane; all pushing, squeezing, crushing with that perfect\r\nfreedom of action which is so peculiar to the masses when educated in\r\nideas of “self-government.”\r\n\r\nOn that evening a stranger who might have chanced to be in Baltimore\r\ncould not have gained admission for love or money into the great hall.\r\nThat was reserved exclusively for resident or corresponding members; no\r\none else could possibly have obtained a place; and the city magnates,\r\nmunicipal councilors, and “select men” were compelled to mingle with\r\nthe mere townspeople in order to catch stray bits of news from the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the vast hall presented a curious spectacle. Its immense\r\narea was singularly adapted to the purpose. Lofty pillars formed of\r\ncannon, superposed upon huge mortars as a base, supported the fine\r\nironwork of the arches, a perfect piece of cast-iron lacework. Trophies\r\nof blunderbuses, matchlocks, arquebuses, carbines, all kinds of\r\nfirearms, ancient and modern, were picturesquely interlaced against the\r\nwalls. The gas lit up in full glare myriads of revolvers grouped in the\r\nform of lustres, while groups of pistols, and candelabra formed of\r\nmuskets bound together, completed this magnificent display of\r\nbrilliance. Models of cannon, bronze castings, sights covered with\r\ndents, plates battered by the shots of the Gun Club, assortments of\r\nrammers and sponges, chaplets of shells, wreaths of projectiles,\r\ngarlands of howitzers—in short, all the apparatus of the artillerist,\r\nenchanted the eye by this wonderful arrangement and induced a kind of\r\nbelief that their real purpose was ornamental rather than deadly.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of the saloon the president, assisted by four\r\nsecretaries, occupied a large platform. His chair, supported by a\r\ncarved gun-carriage, was modeled upon the ponderous proportions of a\r\n32-inch mortar. It was pointed at an angle of ninety degrees, and\r\nsuspended upon truncheons, so that the president could balance himself\r\nupon it as upon a rocking-chair, a very agreeable fact in the very hot\r\nweather. Upon the table (a huge iron plate supported upon six\r\ncarronades) stood an inkstand of exquisite elegance, made of a\r\nbeautifully chased Spanish piece, and a sonnette, which, when required,\r\ncould give forth a report equal to that of a revolver. During violent\r\ndebates this novel kind of bell scarcely sufficed to drown the clamor\r\nof these excitable artillerists.\r\n\r\nIn front of the table benches arranged in zigzag form, like the\r\ncircumvallations of a retrenchment, formed a succession of bastions and\r\ncurtains set apart for the use of the members of the club; and on this\r\nespecial evening one might say, “All the world was on the ramparts.”\r\nThe president was sufficiently well known, however, for all to be\r\nassured that he would not put his colleagues to discomfort without some\r\nvery strong motive.\r\n\r\nImpey Barbicane was a man of forty years of age, calm, cold, austere;\r\nof a singularly serious and self-contained demeanor, punctual as a\r\nchronometer, of imperturbable temper and immovable character; by no\r\nmeans chivalrous, yet adventurous withal, and always bringing practical\r\nideas to bear upon the very rashest enterprises; an essentially New\r\nEnglander, a Northern colonist, a descendant of the old anti-Stuart\r\nRoundheads, and the implacable enemy of the gentlemen of the South,\r\nthose ancient cavaliers of the mother country. In a word, he was a\r\nYankee to the backbone.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had made a large fortune as a timber merchant. Being\r\nnominated director of artillery during the war, he proved himself\r\nfertile in invention. Bold in his conceptions, he contributed\r\npowerfully to the progress of that arm and gave an immense impetus to\r\nexperimental researches.\r\n\r\nHe was personage of the middle height, having, by a rare exception in\r\nthe Gun Club, all his limbs complete. His strongly marked features\r\nseemed drawn by square and rule; and if it be true that, in order to\r\njudge a man’s character one must look at his profile, Barbicane, so\r\nexamined, exhibited the most certain indications of energy, audacity,\r\nand _sang-froid_.\r\n\r\nAt this moment he was sitting in his armchair, silent, absorbed, lost\r\nin reflection, sheltered under his high-crowned hat—a kind of black\r\ncylinder which always seems firmly screwed upon the head of an\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nJust when the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck eight,\r\nBarbicane, as if he had been set in motion by a spring, raised himself\r\nup. A profound silence ensued, and the speaker, in a somewhat emphatic\r\ntone of voice, commenced as follows:\r\n\r\n“My brave, colleagues, too long already a paralyzing peace has plunged\r\nthe members of the Gun Club in deplorable inactivity. After a period of\r\nyears full of incidents we have been compelled to abandon our labors,\r\nand to stop short on the road of progress. I do not hesitate to state,\r\nbaldly, that any war which would recall us to arms would be welcome!”\r\n(_Tremendous applause!_) “But war, gentlemen, is impossible under\r\nexisting circumstances; and, however we may desire it, many years may\r\nelapse before our cannon shall again thunder in the field of battle. We\r\nmust make up our minds, then, to seek in another train of ideas some\r\nfield for the activity which we all pine for.”\r\n\r\nThe meeting felt that the president was now approaching the critical\r\npoint, and redoubled their attention accordingly.\r\n\r\n“For some months past, my brave colleagues,” continued Barbicane, “I\r\nhave been asking myself whether, while confining ourselves to our own\r\nparticular objects, we could not enter upon some grand experiment\r\nworthy of the nineteenth century; and whether the progress of artillery\r\nscience would not enable us to carry it out to a successful issue. I\r\nhave been considering, working, calculating; and the result of my\r\nstudies is the conviction that we are safe to succeed in an enterprise\r\nwhich to any other country would appear wholly impracticable. This\r\nproject, the result of long elaboration, is the object of my present\r\ncommunication. It is worthy of yourselves, worthy of the antecedents of\r\nthe Gun Club; and it cannot fail to make some noise in the world.”\r\n\r\nA thrill of excitement ran through the meeting.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, having by a rapid movement firmly fixed his hat upon his\r\nhead, calmly continued his harangue:\r\n\r\n“There is no one among you, my brave colleagues, who has not seen the\r\nMoon, or, at least, heard speak of it. Don’t be surprised if I am about\r\nto discourse to you regarding the Queen of the Night. It is perhaps\r\nreserved for us to become the Columbuses of this unknown world. Only\r\nenter into my plans, and second me with all your power, and I will lead\r\nyou to its conquest, and its name shall be added to those of the\r\nthirty-six states which compose this Great Union.”\r\n\r\n“Three cheers for the Moon!” roared the Gun Club, with one voice.\r\n\r\n“The moon, gentlemen, has been carefully studied,” continued Barbicane;\r\n“her mass, density, and weight; her constitution, motions, distance, as\r\nwell as her place in the solar system, have all been exactly\r\ndetermined. Selenographic charts have been constructed with a\r\nperfection which equals, if it does not even surpass, that of our\r\nterrestrial maps. Photography has given us proofs of the incomparable\r\nbeauty of our satellite; all is known regarding the moon which\r\nmathematical science, astronomy, geology, and optics can learn about\r\nher. But up to the present moment no direct communication has been\r\nestablished with her.”\r\n\r\nA violent movement of interest and surprise here greeted this remark of\r\nthe speaker.\r\n\r\n“Permit me,” he continued, “to recount to you briefly how certain\r\nardent spirits, starting on imaginary journeys, have penetrated the\r\nsecrets of our satellite. In the seventeenth century a certain David\r\nFabricius boasted of having seen with his own eyes the inhabitants of\r\nthe moon. In 1649 a Frenchman, one Jean Baudoin, published a ‘Journey\r\nperformed from the Earth to the Moon by Domingo Gonzalez,’ a Spanish\r\nadventurer. At the same period Cyrano de Bergerac published that\r\ncelebrated ‘Journeys in the Moon’ which met with such success in\r\nFrance. Somewhat later another Frenchman, named Fontenelle, wrote ‘The\r\nPlurality of Worlds,’ a _chef-d’œuvre_ of its time. About 1835 a small\r\ntreatise, translated from the _New York American_, related how Sir John\r\nHerschel, having been despatched to the Cape of Good Hope for the\r\npurpose of making there some astronomical calculations, had, by means\r\nof a telescope brought to perfection by means of internal lighting,\r\nreduced the apparent distance of the moon to eighty yards! He then\r\ndistinctly perceived caverns frequented by hippopotami, green mountains\r\nbordered by golden lace-work, sheep with horns of ivory, a white\r\nspecies of deer and inhabitants with membranous wings, like bats. This\r\n_brochure_, the work of an American named Locke, had a great sale. But,\r\nto bring this rapid sketch to a close, I will only add that a certain\r\nHans Pfaal, of Rotterdam, launching himself in a balloon filled with a\r\ngas extracted from nitrogen, thirty-seven times lighter than hydrogen,\r\nreached the moon after a passage of nineteen hours. This journey, like\r\nall previous ones, was purely imaginary; still, it was the work of a\r\npopular American author—I mean Edgar Poe!”\r\n\r\n“Cheers for Edgar Poe!” roared the assemblage, electrified by their\r\npresident’s words.\r\n\r\n“I have now enumerated,” said Barbicane, “the experiments which I call\r\npurely paper ones, and wholly insufficient to establish serious\r\nrelations with the Queen of the Night. Nevertheless, I am bound to add\r\nthat some practical geniuses have attempted to establish actual\r\ncommunication with her. Thus, a few days ago, a German geometrician\r\nproposed to send a scientific expedition to the steppes of Siberia.\r\nThere, on those vast plains, they were to describe enormous geometric\r\nfigures, drawn in characters of reflecting luminosity, among which was\r\nthe proposition regarding the ‘square of the hypothenuse,’ commonly\r\ncalled the ‘_Ass’s Bridge_’ by the French. ‘Every intelligent being,’\r\nsaid the geometrician, ‘must understand the scientific meaning of that\r\nfigure. The Selenites, do they exist, will respond by a similar figure;\r\nand, a communication being thus once established, it will be easy to\r\nform an alphabet which shall enable us to converse with the inhabitants\r\nof the moon.’ So spoke the German geometrician; but his project was\r\nnever put into practice, and up to the present day there is no bond in\r\nexistence between the Earth and her satellite. It is reserved for the\r\npractical genius of Americans to establish a communication with the\r\nsidereal world. The means of arriving thither are simple, easy,\r\ncertain, infallible—and that is the purpose of my present proposal.”\r\n\r\nA storm of acclamations greeted these words. There was not a single\r\nperson in the whole audience who was not overcome, carried away, lifted\r\nout of himself by the speaker’s words!\r\n\r\nLong-continued applause resounded from all sides.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had partially subsided, Barbicane resumed his\r\nspeech in a somewhat graver voice.\r\n\r\n“You know,” said he, “what progress artillery science has made during\r\nthe last few years, and what a degree of perfection firearms of every\r\nkind have reached. Moreover, you are well aware that, in general terms,\r\nthe resisting power of cannon and the expansive force of gunpowder are\r\npractically unlimited. Well! starting from this principle, I ask myself\r\nwhether, supposing sufficient apparatus could be obtained constructed\r\nupon the conditions of ascertained resistance, it might not be possible\r\nto project a shot up to the moon?”\r\n\r\nAt these words a murmur of amazement escaped from a thousand panting\r\nchests; then succeeded a moment of perfect silence, resembling that\r\nprofound stillness which precedes the bursting of a thunderstorm. In\r\npoint of fact, a thunderstorm did peal forth, but it was the thunder of\r\napplause, or cries, and of uproar which made the very hall tremble. The\r\npresident attempted to speak, but could not. It was fully ten minutes\r\nbefore he could make himself heard.\r\n\r\n“Suffer me to finish,” he calmly continued. “I have looked at the\r\nquestion in all its bearings, I have resolutely attacked it, and by\r\nincontrovertible calculations I find that a projectile endowed with an\r\ninitial velocity of 12,000 yards per second, and aimed at the moon,\r\nmust necessarily reach it. I have the honor, my brave colleagues, to\r\npropose a trial of this little experiment.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nEFFECT OF THE PRESIDENT’S COMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the effect produced by the last words of\r\nthe honorable president—the cries, the shouts, the succession of roars,\r\nhurrahs, and all the varied vociferations which the American language\r\nis capable of supplying. It was a scene of indescribable confusion and\r\nuproar. They shouted, they clapped, they stamped on the floor of the\r\nhall. All the weapons in the museum discharged at once could not have\r\nmore violently set in motion the waves of sound. One need not be\r\nsurprised at this. There are some cannoneers nearly as noisy as their\r\nown guns.\r\n\r\nBarbicane remained calm in the midst of this enthusiastic clamor;\r\nperhaps he was desirous of addressing a few more words to his\r\ncolleagues, for by his gestures he demanded silence, and his powerful\r\nalarum was worn out by its violent reports. No attention, however, was\r\npaid to his request. He was presently torn from his seat and passed\r\nfrom the hands of his faithful colleagues into the arms of a no less\r\nexcited crowd.\r\n\r\nNothing can astound an American. It has often been asserted that the\r\nword “impossible” is not a French one. People have evidently been\r\ndeceived by the dictionary. In America, all is easy, all is simple; and\r\nas for mechanical difficulties, they are overcome before they arise.\r\nBetween Barbicane’s proposition and its realization no true Yankee\r\nwould have allowed even the semblance of a difficulty to be possible. A\r\nthing with them is no sooner said than done.\r\n\r\nThe triumphal progress of the president continued throughout the\r\nevening. It was a regular torchlight procession. Irish, Germans,\r\nFrench, Scotch, all the heterogeneous units which make up the\r\npopulation of Maryland shouted in their respective vernaculars; and the\r\n“vivas,” “hurrahs,” and “bravos” were intermingled in inexpressible\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nJust at this crisis, as though she comprehended all this agitation\r\nregarding herself, the moon shone forth with serene splendor, eclipsing\r\nby her intense illumination all the surrounding lights. The Yankees all\r\nturned their gaze toward her resplendent orb, kissed their hands,\r\ncalled her by all kinds of endearing names. Between eight o’clock and\r\nmidnight one optician in Jones’-Fall Street made his fortune by the\r\nsale of opera-glasses.\r\n\r\nMidnight arrived, and the enthusiasm showed no signs of diminution. It\r\nspread equally among all classes of citizens—men of science,\r\nshopkeepers, merchants, porters, chair-men, as well as “greenhorns,”\r\nwere stirred in their innermost fibres. A national enterprise was at\r\nstake. The whole city, high and low, the quays bordering the Patapsco,\r\nthe ships lying in the basins, disgorged a crowd drunk with joy, gin,\r\nand whisky. Every one chattered, argued, discussed, disputed,\r\napplauded, from the gentleman lounging upon the barroom settee with his\r\ntumbler of sherry-cobbler before him down to the waterman who got drunk\r\nupon his “knock-me-down” in the dingy taverns of Fell Point.\r\n\r\nAbout two A.M., however, the excitement began to subside. President\r\nBarbicane reached his house, bruised, crushed, and squeezed almost to a\r\nmummy. Hercules could not have resisted a similar outbreak of\r\nenthusiasm. The crowd gradually deserted the squares and streets. The\r\nfour railways from Philadelphia and Washington, Harrisburg and\r\nWheeling, which converge at Baltimore, whirled away the heterogeneous\r\npopulation to the four corners of the United States, and the city\r\nsubsided into comparative tranquility.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, thanks to the telegraphic wires, five hundred\r\nnewspapers and journals, daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly, all\r\ntook up the question. They examined it under all its different aspects,\r\nphysical, meteorological, economical, or moral, up to its bearings on\r\npolitics or civilization. They debated whether the moon was a finished\r\nworld, or whether it was destined to undergo any further\r\ntransformation. Did it resemble the earth at the period when the latter\r\nwas destitute as yet of an atmosphere? What kind of spectacle would its\r\nhidden hemisphere present to our terrestrial spheroid? Granting that\r\nthe question at present was simply that of sending a projectile up to\r\nthe moon, every one must see that that involved the commencement of a\r\nseries of experiments. All must hope that some day America would\r\npenetrate the deepest secrets of that mysterious orb; and some even\r\nseemed to fear lest its conquest should not sensibly derange the\r\nequilibrium of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe project once under discussion, not a single paragraph suggested a\r\ndoubt of its realization. All the papers, pamphlets, reports—all the\r\njournals published by the scientific, literary, and religious societies\r\nenlarged upon its advantages; and the Society of Natural History of\r\nBoston, the Society of Science and Art of Albany, the Geographical and\r\nStatistical Society of New York, the Philosophical Society of\r\nPhiladelphia, and the Smithsonian of Washington sent innumerable\r\nletters of congratulation to the Gun Club, together with offers of\r\nimmediate assistance and money.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forward Impey Barbicane became one of the greatest\r\ncitizens of the United States, a kind of Washington of science. A\r\nsingle trait of feeling, taken from many others, will serve to show the\r\npoint which this homage of a whole people to a single individual\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nSome few days after this memorable meeting of the Gun Club, the manager\r\nof an English company announced, at the Baltimore theatre, the\r\nproduction of “Much ado about Nothing.” But the populace, seeing in\r\nthat title an allusion damaging to Barbicane’s project, broke into the\r\nauditorium, smashed the benches, and compelled the unlucky director to\r\nalter his playbill. Being a sensible man, he bowed to the public will\r\nand replaced the offending comedy by “As you like it”; and for many\r\nweeks he realized fabulous profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nREPLY FROM THE OBSERVATORY OF CAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane, however, lost not one moment amid all the enthusiasm of\r\nwhich he had become the object. His first care was to reassemble his\r\ncolleagues in the board-room of the Gun Club. There, after some\r\ndiscussion, it was agreed to consult the astronomers regarding the\r\nastronomical part of the enterprise. Their reply once ascertained, they\r\ncould then discuss the mechanical means, and nothing should be wanting\r\nto ensure the success of this great experiment.\r\n\r\nA note couched in precise terms, containing special interrogatories,\r\nwas then drawn up and addressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in\r\nMassachusetts. This city, where the first university of the United\r\nStates was founded, is justly celebrated for its astronomical staff.\r\nThere are to be found assembled all the most eminent men of science.\r\nHere is to be seen at work that powerful telescope which enabled Bond\r\nto resolve the nebula of Andromeda, and Clarke to discover the\r\nsatellite of Sirius. This celebrated institution fully justified on all\r\npoints the confidence reposed in it by the Gun Club. So, after two\r\ndays, the reply so impatiently awaited was placed in the hands of\r\nPresident Barbicane.\r\n\r\nIt was couched in the following terms:\r\n\r\n_The Director of the Cambridge Observatory to the President of the Gun\r\nClub at Baltimore._\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, October 7. On the receipt of your favor of the 6th instant,\r\naddressed to the Observatory of Cambridge in the name of the members of\r\nthe Baltimore Gun Club, our staff was immediately called together, and\r\nit was judged expedient to reply as follows:\r\n\r\nThe questions which have been proposed to it are these—\r\n\r\n“1. Is it possible to transmit a projectile up to the moon?\r\n\r\n“2. What is the exact distance which separates the earth from its\r\nsatellite?\r\n\r\n“3. What will be the period of transit of the projectile when endowed\r\nwith sufficient initial velocity? and, consequently, at what moment\r\nought it to be discharged in order that it may touch the moon at a\r\nparticular point?\r\n\r\n“4. At what precise moment will the moon present herself in the most\r\nfavorable position to be reached by the projectile?\r\n\r\n“5. What point in the heavens ought the cannon to be aimed at which is\r\nintended to discharge the projectile?\r\n\r\n“6. What place will the moon occupy in the heavens at the moment of the\r\nprojectile’s departure?”\r\n\r\nRegarding the _first_ question, “Is it possible to transmit a\r\nprojectile up to the moon?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—Yes; provided it possess an initial velocity of 12,000 yards\r\nper second; calculations prove that to be sufficient. In proportion as\r\nwe recede from the earth the action of gravitation diminishes in the\r\ninverse ratio of the square of the distance; that is to say, _at three\r\ntimes a given distance the action is nine times less._ Consequently,\r\nthe weight of a shot will decrease, and will become reduced to _zero_\r\nat the instant that the attraction of the moon exactly counterpoises\r\nthat of the earth; that is to say at 47/52 of its passage. At that\r\ninstant the projectile will have no weight whatever; and, if it passes\r\nthat point, it will fall into the moon by the sole effect of the lunar\r\nattraction. The _theoretical possibility_ of the experiment is\r\ntherefore absolutely demonstrated; its _success_ must depend upon the\r\npower of the engine employed.\r\n\r\nAs to the _second_ question, “What is the exact distance which\r\nseparates the earth from its satellite?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—The moon does not describe a _circle_ round the earth, but\r\nrather an _ellipse_, of which our earth occupies one of the _foci_; the\r\nconsequence, therefore, is, that at certain times it approaches nearer\r\nto, and at others it recedes farther from, the earth; in astronomical\r\nlanguage, it is at one time in _apogee_, at another in _perigee_. Now\r\nthe difference between its greatest and its least distance is too\r\nconsiderable to be left out of consideration. In point of fact, in its\r\napogee the moon is 247,552 miles, and in its perigee, 218,657 miles\r\nonly distant; a fact which makes a difference of 28,895 miles, or more\r\nthan one-ninth of the entire distance. The perigee distance, therefore,\r\nis that which ought to serve as the basis of all calculations.\r\n\r\nTo the _third_ question:—\r\n\r\n_Answer._—If the shot should preserve continuously its initial velocity\r\nof 12,000 yards per second, it would require little more than nine\r\nhours to reach its destination; but, inasmuch as that initial velocity\r\nwill be continually decreasing, it will occupy 300,000 seconds, that is\r\n83hrs. 20m. in reaching the point where the attraction of the earth and\r\nmoon will be _in equilibrio_. From this point it will fall into the\r\nmoon in 50,000 seconds, or 13hrs. 53m. 20sec. It will be desirable,\r\ntherefore, to discharge it 97hrs. 13m. 20sec. before the arrival of the\r\nmoon at the point aimed at.\r\n\r\nRegarding question _four_, “At what precise moment will the moon\r\npresent herself in the most favorable position, etc.?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—After what has been said above, it will be necessary, first\r\nof all, to choose the period when the moon will be in perigee, and\r\n_also_ the moment when she will be crossing the zenith, which latter\r\nevent will further diminish the entire distance by a length equal to\r\nthe radius of the earth, _i. e._ 3,919 miles; the result of which will\r\nbe that the final passage remaining to be accomplished will be 214,976\r\nmiles. But although the moon passes her perigee every month, she does\r\nnot reach the zenith always _at exactly the same moment_. She does not\r\nappear under these two conditions simultaneously, except at long\r\nintervals of time. It will be necessary, therefore, to wait for the\r\nmoment when her passage in perigee shall coincide with that in the\r\nzenith. Now, by a fortunate circumstance, on the 4th of December in the\r\nensuing year the moon _will_ present these two conditions. At midnight\r\nshe will be in perigee, that is, at her shortest distance from the\r\nearth, and at the same moment she will be crossing the zenith.\r\n\r\nOn the _fifth_ question, “At what point in the heavens ought the cannon\r\nto be aimed?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—The preceding remarks being admitted, the cannon ought to be\r\npointed to the zenith of the place. Its fire, therefore, will be\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the horizon; and the projectile will\r\nsoonest pass beyond the range of the terrestrial attraction. But, in\r\norder that the moon should reach the zenith of a given place, it is\r\nnecessary that the place should not exceed in latitude the declination\r\nof the luminary; in other words, it must be comprised within the\r\ndegrees 0° and 28° of lat. N. or S. In every other spot the fire must\r\nnecessarily be oblique, which would seriously militate against the\r\nsuccess of the experiment.\r\n\r\nAs to the _sixth_ question, “What place will the moon occupy in the\r\nheavens at the moment of the projectile’s departure?”\r\n\r\n_Answer._—At the moment when the projectile shall be discharged into\r\nspace, the moon, which travels daily forward 13° 10′ 35″, will be\r\ndistant from the zenith point by four times that quantity, _i. e._ by\r\n52° 41′ 20″, a space which corresponds to the path which she will\r\ndescribe during the entire journey of the projectile. But, inasmuch as\r\nit is equally necessary to take into account the deviation which the\r\nrotary motion of the earth will impart to the shot, and as the shot\r\ncannot reach the moon until after a deviation equal to 16 radii of the\r\nearth, which, calculated upon the moon’s orbit, are equal to about\r\neleven degrees, it becomes necessary to add these eleven degrees to\r\nthose which express the retardation of the moon just mentioned: that is\r\nto say, in round numbers, about sixty-four degrees. Consequently, at\r\nthe moment of firing the visual radius applied to the moon will\r\ndescribe, with the vertical line of the place, an angle of sixty-four\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThese are our answers to the questions proposed to the Observatory of\r\nCambridge by the members of the Gun Club:—\r\n\r\nTo sum up—\r\n\r\n1st. The cannon ought to be planted in a country situated between 0°\r\nand 28° of N. or S. lat.\r\n\r\n2nd. It ought to be pointed directly toward the zenith of the place.\r\n\r\n3rd. The projectile ought to be propelled with an initial velocity of\r\n12,000 yards per second.\r\n\r\n4th. It ought to be discharged at 10hrs. 46m. 40sec. of the 1st of\r\nDecember of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n5th. It will meet the moon four days after its discharge, precisely at\r\nmidnight on the 4th of December, at the moment of its transit across\r\nthe zenith.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Gun Club ought, therefore, without delay, to\r\ncommence the works necessary for such an experiment, and to be prepared\r\nto set to work at the moment determined upon; for, if they should\r\nsuffer this 4th of December to go by, they will not find the moon again\r\nunder the same conditions of perigee and of zenith until eighteen years\r\nand eleven days afterward.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Cambridge Observatory place themselves entirely at\r\ntheir disposal in respect of all questions of theoretical astronomy;\r\nand herewith add their congratulations to those of all the rest of\r\nAmerica. For the Astronomical Staff, J. M. BELFAST, _Director of the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nAn observer endued with an infinite range of vision, and placed in that\r\nunknown center around which the entire world revolves, might have\r\nbeheld myriads of atoms filling all space during the chaotic epoch of\r\nthe universe. Little by little, as ages went on, a change took place; a\r\ngeneral law of attraction manifested itself, to which the hitherto\r\nerrant atoms became obedient: these atoms combined together chemically\r\naccording to their affinities, formed themselves into molecules, and\r\ncomposed those nebulous masses with which the depths of the heavens are\r\nstrewed. These masses became immediately endued with a rotary motion\r\naround their own central point. This center, formed of indefinite\r\nmolecules, began to revolve around its own axis during its gradual\r\ncondensation; then, following the immutable laws of mechanics, in\r\nproportion as its bulk diminished by condensation, its rotary motion\r\nbecame accelerated, and these two effects continuing, the result was\r\nthe formation of one principal star, the center of the nebulous mass.\r\n\r\nBy attentively watching, the observer would then have perceived the\r\nother molecules of the mass, following the example of this central\r\nstar, become likewise condensed by gradually accelerated rotation, and\r\ngravitating round it in the shape of innumerable stars. Thus was formed\r\nthe _Nebulæ_, of which astronomers have reckoned up nearly 5,000.\r\n\r\nAmong these 5,000 nebulæ there is one which has received the name of\r\nthe Milky Way, and which contains eighteen millions of stars, each of\r\nwhich has become the center of a solar world.\r\n\r\nIf the observer had then specially directed his attention to one of the\r\nmore humble and less brilliant of these stellar bodies, a star of the\r\nfourth class, that which is arrogantly called the Sun, all the\r\nphenomena to which the formation of the Universe is to be ascribed\r\nwould have been successively fulfilled before his eyes. In fact, he\r\nwould have perceived this sun, as yet in the gaseous state, and\r\ncomposed of moving molecules, revolving round its axis in order to\r\naccomplish its work of concentration. This motion, faithful to the laws\r\nof mechanics, would have been accelerated with the diminution of its\r\nvolume; and a moment would have arrived when the centrifugal force\r\nwould have overpowered the centripetal, which causes the molecules all\r\nto tend toward the center.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon would now have passed before the observer’s eye, and\r\nthe molecules situated on the plane of the equator, escaping like a\r\nstone from a sling of which the cord had suddenly snapped, would have\r\nformed around the sun sundry concentric rings resembling that of\r\nSaturn. In their turn, again, these rings of cosmical matter, excited\r\nby a rotary motion about the central mass, would have been broken up\r\nand decomposed into secondary nebulosities, that is to say, into\r\nplanets. Similarly he would have observed these planets throw off one\r\nor more rings each, which became the origin of the secondary bodies\r\nwhich we call satellites.\r\n\r\nThus, then, advancing from atom to molecule, from molecule to nebulous\r\nmass, from that to principal star, from star to sun, from sun to\r\nplanet, and hence to satellite, we have the whole series of\r\ntransformations undergone by the heavenly bodies during the first days\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nNow, of those attendant bodies which the sun maintains in their\r\nelliptical orbits by the great law of gravitation, some few in turn\r\npossess satellites. Uranus has eight, Saturn eight, Jupiter four,\r\nNeptune possibly three, and the Earth one. This last, one of the least\r\nimportant of the entire solar system, we call the Moon; and it is she\r\nwhom the daring genius of the Americans professed their intention of\r\nconquering.\r\n\r\nThe moon, by her comparative proximity, and the constantly varying\r\nappearances produced by her several phases, has always occupied a\r\nconsiderable share of the attention of the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Thales of Miletus, in the fifth century B.C., down to\r\nthat of Copernicus in the fifteenth and Tycho Brahé in the sixteenth\r\ncentury A.D., observations have been from time to time carried on with\r\nmore or less correctness, until in the present day the altitudes of the\r\nlunar mountains have been determined with exactitude. Galileo explained\r\nthe phenomena of the lunar light produced during certain of her phases\r\nby the existence of mountains, to which he assigned a mean altitude of\r\n27,000 feet. After him Hévelius, an astronomer of Dantzic, reduced the\r\nhighest elevations to 15,000 feet; but the calculations of Riccioli\r\nbrought them up again to 21,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eighteenth century Herschel, armed with a powerful\r\ntelescope, considerably reduced the preceding measurements. He assigned\r\na height of 11,400 feet to the maximum elevations, and reduced the mean\r\nof the different altitudes to little more than 2,400 feet. But\r\nHerschel’s calculations were in their turn corrected by the\r\nobservations of Halley, Nasmyth, Bianchini, Gruithuysen, and others;\r\nbut it was reserved for the labors of Boeer and Maedler finally to\r\nsolve the question. They succeeded in measuring 1,905 different\r\nelevations, of which six exceed 15,000 feet, and twenty-two exceed\r\n14,400 feet. The highest summit of all towers to a height of 22,606\r\nfeet above the surface of the lunar disc. At the same period the\r\nexamination of the moon was completed. She appeared completely riddled\r\nwith craters, and her essentially volcanic character was apparent at\r\neach observation. By the absence of refraction in the rays of the\r\nplanets occulted by her we conclude that she is absolutely devoid of an\r\natmosphere. The absence of air entails the absence of water. It became,\r\ntherefore, manifest that the Selenites, to support life under such\r\nconditions, must possess a special organization of their own, must\r\ndiffer remarkably from the inhabitants of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt length, thanks to modern art, instruments of still higher perfection\r\nsearched the moon without intermission, not leaving a single point of\r\nher surface unexplored; and notwithstanding that her diameter measures\r\n2,150 miles, her surface equals the one-fifteenth part of that of our\r\nglobe, and her bulk the one-forty-ninth part of that of the terrestrial\r\nspheroid—not one of her secrets was able to escape the eyes of the\r\nastronomers; and these skillful men of science carried to an even\r\ngreater degree their prodigious observations.\r\n\r\nThus they remarked that, during full moon, the disc appeared scored in\r\ncertain parts with white lines; and, during the phases, with black. On\r\nprosecuting the study of these with still greater precision, they\r\nsucceeded in obtaining an exact account of the nature of these lines.\r\nThey were long and narrow furrows sunk between parallel ridges,\r\nbordering generally upon the edges of the craters. Their length varied\r\nbetween ten and 100 miles, and their width was about 1,600 yards.\r\nAstronomers called them chasms, but they could not get any further.\r\nWhether these chasms were the dried-up beds of ancient rivers or not\r\nthey were unable thoroughly to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, among others, hoped one day or other to determine this\r\ngeological question. They also undertook to examine the true nature of\r\nthat system of parallel ramparts discovered on the moon’s surface by\r\nGruithuysen, a learned professor of Munich, who considered them to be\r\n“a system of fortifications thrown up by the Selenitic engineers.”\r\nThese two points, yet obscure, as well as others, no doubt, could not\r\nbe definitely settled except by direct communication with the moon.\r\n\r\nRegarding the degree of intensity of its light, there was nothing more\r\nto learn on this point. It was known that it is 300,000 times weaker\r\nthan that of the sun, and that its heat has no appreciable effect upon\r\nthe thermometer. As to the phenomenon known as the “ashy light,” it is\r\nexplained naturally by the effect of the transmission of the solar rays\r\nfrom the earth to the moon, which give the appearance of completeness\r\nto the lunar disc, while it presents itself under the crescent form\r\nduring its first and last phases.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of knowledge acquired regarding the earth’s\r\nsatellite, which the Gun Club undertook to perfect in all its aspects,\r\ncosmographic, geological, political, and moral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nPERMISSIVE LIMITS OF IGNORANCE AND BELIEF IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of Barbicane’s proposition was to place upon the\r\norders of the day all the astronomical facts relative to the Queen of\r\nthe Night. Everybody set to work to study assiduously. One would have\r\nthought that the moon had just appeared for the first time, and that no\r\none had ever before caught a glimpse of her in the heavens. The papers\r\nrevived all the old anecdotes in which the “sun of the wolves” played a\r\npart; they recalled the influences which the ignorance of past ages\r\nascribed to her; in short, all America was seized with selenomania, or\r\nhad become moon-mad.\r\n\r\nThe scientific journals, for their part, dealt more especially with the\r\nquestions which touched upon the enterprise of the Gun Club. The letter\r\nof the Observatory of Cambridge was published by them, and commented\r\nupon with unreserved approval.\r\n\r\nUntil that time most people had been ignorant of the mode in which the\r\ndistance which separates the moon from the earth is calculated. They\r\ntook advantage of this fact to explain to them that this distance was\r\nobtained by measuring the parallax of the moon. The term parallax\r\nproving “caviare to the general,” they further explained that it meant\r\nthe angle formed by the inclination of two straight lines drawn from\r\neither extremity of the earth’s radius to the moon. On doubts being\r\nexpressed as to the correctness of this method, they immediately proved\r\nthat not only was the mean distance 234,347 miles, but that astronomers\r\ncould not possibly be in error in their estimate by more than seventy\r\nmiles either way.\r\n\r\nTo those who were not familiar with the motions of the moon, they\r\ndemonstrated that she possesses two distinct motions, the first being\r\nthat of rotation upon her axis, the second being that of revolution\r\nround the earth, accomplishing both together in an equal period of\r\ntime, that is to say, in twenty-seven and one-third days.\r\n\r\nThe motion of rotation is that which produces day and night on the\r\nsurface of the moon; save that there is only one day and one night in\r\nthe lunar month, each lasting three hundred and fifty-four and\r\none-third hours. But, happily for her, the face turned toward the\r\nterrestrial globe is illuminated by it with an intensity equal to that\r\nof fourteen moons. As to the other face, always invisible to us, it has\r\nof necessity three hundred and fifty-four hours of absolute night,\r\ntempered only by that “pale glimmer which falls upon it from the\r\nstars.”\r\n\r\nSome well-intentioned, but rather obstinate persons, could not at first\r\ncomprehend how, if the moon displays invariably the same face to the\r\nearth during her revolution, she can describe one turn round herself.\r\nTo such they answered, “Go into your dining-room, and walk round the\r\ntable in such a way as to always keep your face turned toward the\r\ncenter; by the time you will have achieved one complete round you will\r\nhave completed one turn around yourself, since your eye will have\r\ntraversed successively every point of the room. Well, then, the room is\r\nthe heavens, the table is the earth, and the moon is yourself.” And\r\nthey would go away delighted.\r\n\r\nSo, then the moon displays invariably the same face to the earth;\r\nnevertheless, to be quite exact, it is necessary to add that, in\r\nconsequence of certain fluctuations of north and south, and of west and\r\neast, termed her libration, she permits rather more than half, that is\r\nto say, five-sevenths, to be seen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ignoramuses came to understand as much as the director\r\nof the observatory himself knew, they began to worry themselves\r\nregarding her revolution round the earth, whereupon twenty scientific\r\nreviews immediately came to the rescue. They pointed out to them that\r\nthe firmament, with its infinitude of stars, may be considered as one\r\nvast dial-plate, upon which the moon travels, indicating the true time\r\nto all the inhabitants of the earth; that it is during this movement\r\nthat the Queen of Night exhibits her different phases; that the moon is\r\n_full_ when she is in _opposition_ with the sun, that is when the three\r\nbodies are on the same straight line, the earth occupying the center;\r\nthat she is _new_ when she is in _conjunction_ with the sun, that is,\r\nwhen she is between it and the earth; and, lastly that she is in her\r\n_first_ or _last_ quarter, when she makes with the sun and the earth an\r\nangle of which she herself occupies the apex.\r\n\r\nRegarding the altitude which the moon attains above the horizon, the\r\nletter of the Cambridge Observatory had said all that was to be said in\r\nthis respect. Every one knew that this altitude varies according to the\r\nlatitude of the observer. But the only zones of the globe in which the\r\nmoon passes the zenith, that is, the point directly over the head of\r\nthe spectator, are of necessity comprised between the twenty-eighth\r\nparallels and the equator. Hence the importance of the advice to try\r\nthe experiment upon some point of that part of the globe, in order that\r\nthe projectile might be discharged perpendicularly, and so the soonest\r\nescape the action of gravitation. This was an essential condition to\r\nthe success of the enterprise, and continued actively to engage the\r\npublic attention.\r\n\r\nRegarding the path described by the moon in her revolution round the\r\nearth, the Cambridge Observatory had demonstrated that this path is a\r\nre-entering curve, not a perfect circle, but an ellipse, of which the\r\nearth occupies one of the _foci_. It was also well understood that it\r\nis farthest removed from the earth during its _apogee_, and approaches\r\nmost nearly to it at its _perigee_.\r\n\r\nSuch was then the extent of knowledge possessed by every American on\r\nthe subject, and of which no one could decently profess ignorance.\r\nStill, while these principles were being rapidly disseminated many\r\nerrors and illusory fears proved less easy to eradicate.\r\n\r\nFor instance, some worthy persons maintained that the moon was an\r\nancient comet which, in describing its elongated orbit round the sun,\r\nhappened to pass near the earth, and became confined within her circle\r\nof attraction. These drawing-room astronomers professed to explain the\r\ncharred aspect of the moon—a disaster which they attributed to the\r\nintensity of the solar heat; only, on being reminded that comets have\r\nan atmosphere, and that the moon has little or none, they were fairly\r\nat a loss for a reply.\r\n\r\nOthers again, belonging to the doubting class, expressed certain fears\r\nas to the position of the moon. They had heard it said that, according\r\nto observations made in the time of the Caliphs, her revolution had\r\nbecome accelerated in a certain degree. Hence they concluded, logically\r\nenough, that an acceleration of motion ought to be accompanied by a\r\ncorresponding diminution in the distance separating the two bodies; and\r\nthat, supposing the double effect to be continued to infinity, the moon\r\nwould end by one day falling into the earth. However, they became\r\nreassured as to the fate of future generations on being apprised that,\r\naccording to the calculations of Laplace, this acceleration of motion\r\nis confined within very restricted limits, and that a proportional\r\ndiminution of speed will be certain to succeed it. So, then, the\r\nstability of the solar system would not be deranged in ages to come.\r\n\r\nThere remains but the third class, the superstitious. These worthies\r\nwere not content merely to rest in ignorance; they must know all about\r\nthings which had no existence whatever, and as to the moon, they had\r\nlong known all about her. One set regarded her disc as a polished\r\nmirror, by means of which people could see each other from different\r\npoints of the earth and interchange their thoughts. Another set\r\npretended that out of one thousand new moons that had been observed,\r\nnine hundred and fifty had been attended with remarkable disturbances,\r\nsuch as cataclysms, revolutions, earthquakes, the deluge, etc. Then\r\nthey believed in some mysterious influence exercised by her over human\r\ndestinies—that every Selenite was attached to some inhabitant of the\r\nearth by a tie of sympathy; they maintained that the entire vital\r\nsystem is subject to her control, etc. But in time the majority\r\nrenounced these vulgar errors, and espoused the true side of the\r\nquestion. As for the Yankees, they had no other ambition than to take\r\npossession of this new continent of the sky, and to plant upon the\r\nsummit of its highest elevation the star- spangled banner of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE HYMN OF THE CANNON-BALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Observatory of Cambridge in its memorable letter had treated the\r\nquestion from a purely astronomical point of view. The mechanical part\r\nstill remained.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane had, without loss of time, nominated a working\r\ncommittee of the Gun Club. The duty of this committee was to resolve\r\nthe three grand questions of the cannon, the projectile, and the\r\npowder. It was composed of four members of great technical knowledge,\r\nBarbicane (with a casting vote in case of equality), General Morgan,\r\nMajor Elphinstone, and J. T. Maston, to whom were confided the\r\nfunctions of secretary. On the 8th of October the committee met at the\r\nhouse of President Barbicane, 3 Republican Street. The meeting was\r\nopened by the president himself.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, “we have to resolve one of the most important\r\nproblems in the whole of the noble science of gunnery. It might appear,\r\nperhaps, the most logical course to devote our first meeting to the\r\ndiscussion of the engine to be employed. Nevertheless, after mature\r\nconsideration, it has appeared to me that the question of the\r\nprojectile must take precedence of that of the cannon, and that the\r\ndimensions of the latter must necessarily depend on those of the\r\nformer.”\r\n\r\n“Suffer me to say a word,” here broke in J. T. Maston. Permission\r\nhaving been granted, “Gentlemen,” said he with an inspired accent, “our\r\npresident is right in placing the question of the projectile above all\r\nothers. The ball we are about to discharge at the moon is our\r\nambassador to her, and I wish to consider it from a moral point of\r\nview. The cannon-ball, gentlemen, to my mind, is the most magnificent\r\nmanifestation of human power. If Providence has created the stars and\r\nthe planets, man has called the cannon-ball into existence. Let\r\nProvidence claim the swiftness of electricity and of light, of the\r\nstars, the comets, and the planets, of wind and sound—we claim to have\r\ninvented the swiftness of the cannon-ball, a hundred times superior to\r\nthat of the swiftest horses or railway train. How glorious will be the\r\nmoment when, infinitely exceeding all hitherto attained velocities, we\r\nshall launch our new projectile with the rapidity of seven miles a\r\nsecond! Shall it not, gentlemen—shall it not be received up there with\r\nthe honors due to a terrestrial ambassador?”\r\n\r\nOvercome with emotion the orator sat down and applied himself to a huge\r\nplate of sandwiches before him.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Barbicane, “let us quit the domain of poetry and come\r\ndirect to the question.”\r\n\r\n“By all means,” replied the members, each with his mouth full of\r\nsandwich.\r\n\r\n“The problem before us,” continued the president, “is how to\r\ncommunicate to a projectile a velocity of 12,000 yards per second. Let\r\nus at present examine the velocities hitherto attained. General Morgan\r\nwill be able to enlighten us on this point.”\r\n\r\n“And the more easily,” replied the general, “that during the war I was\r\na member of the committee of experiments. I may say, then, that the\r\n100-pounder Dahlgrens, which carried a distance of 5,000 yards,\r\nimpressed upon their projectile an initial velocity of 500 yards a\r\nsecond. The Rodman Columbiad threw a shot weighing half a ton a\r\ndistance of six miles, with a velocity of 800 yards per second—a result\r\nwhich Armstrong and Palisser have never obtained in England.”\r\n\r\n“This,” replied Barbicane, “is, I believe, the maximum velocity ever\r\nattained?”\r\n\r\n“It is so,” replied the general.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” groaned J. T. Maston, “if my mortar had not burst—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” quietly replied Barbicane, “but it did burst. We must take,\r\nthen, for our starting point, this velocity of 800 yards. We must\r\nincrease it twenty-fold. Now, reserving for another discussion the\r\nmeans of producing this velocity, I will call your attention to the\r\ndimensions which it will be proper to assign to the shot. You\r\nunderstand that we have nothing to do here with projectiles weighing at\r\nmost but half a ton.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” demanded the major.\r\n\r\n“Because the shot,” quickly replied J. T. Maston, “must be big enough\r\nto attract the attention of the inhabitants of the moon, if there are\r\nany?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Barbicane, “and for another reason more important\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\n“What mean you?” asked the major.\r\n\r\n“I mean that it is not enough to discharge a projectile, and then take\r\nno further notice of it; we must follow it throughout its course, up to\r\nthe moment when it shall reach its goal.”\r\n\r\n“What?” shouted the general and the major in great surprise.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied Barbicane composedly, “or our experiment would\r\nproduce no result.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” replied the major, “you will have to give this projectile\r\nenormous dimensions.”\r\n\r\n“No! Be so good as to listen. You know that optical instruments have\r\nacquired great perfection; with certain instruments we have succeeded\r\nin obtaining enlargements of 6,000 times and reducing the moon to\r\nwithin forty miles’ distance. Now, at this distance, any objects sixty\r\nfeet square would be perfectly visible.\r\n\r\n“If, then, the penetrative power of telescopes has not been further\r\nincreased, it is because that power detracts from their light; and the\r\nmoon, which is but a reflecting mirror, does not give back sufficient\r\nlight to enable us to perceive objects of lesser magnitude.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, what do you propose to do?” asked the general. “Would you\r\ngive your projectile a diameter of sixty feet?”\r\n\r\n“Not so.”\r\n\r\n“Do you intend, then, to increase the luminous power of the moon?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. If I can succeed in diminishing the density of the\r\natmosphere through which the moon’s light has to travel I shall have\r\nrendered her light more intense. To effect that object it will be\r\nenough to establish a telescope on some elevated mountain. That is what\r\nwe will do.”\r\n\r\n“I give it up,” answered the major. “You have such a way of simplifying\r\nthings. And what enlargement do you expect to obtain in this way?”\r\n\r\n“One of 48,000 times, which should bring the moon within an apparent\r\ndistance of five miles; and, in order to be visible, objects need not\r\nhave a diameter of more than nine feet.”\r\n\r\n“So, then,” cried J. T. Maston, “our projectile need not be more than\r\nnine feet in diameter.”\r\n\r\n“Let me observe, however,” interrupted Major Elphinstone, “this will\r\ninvolve a weight such as—”\r\n\r\n“My dear major,” replied Barbicane, “before discussing its weight\r\npermit me to enumerate some of the marvels which our ancestors have\r\nachieved in this respect. I don’t mean to pretend that the science of\r\ngunnery has not advanced, but it is as well to bear in mind that during\r\nthe middle ages they obtained results more surprising, I will venture\r\nto say, than ours. For instance, during the siege of Constantinople by\r\nMahomet II., in 1453, stone shot of 1,900 pounds weight were employed.\r\nAt Malta, in the time of the knights, there was a gun of the fortress\r\nof St. Elmo which threw a projectile weighing 2,500 pounds. And, now,\r\nwhat is the extent of what we have seen ourselves? Armstrong guns\r\ndischarging shot of 500 pounds, and the Rodman guns projectiles of half\r\na ton! It seems, then, that if projectiles have gained in range, they\r\nhave lost far more in weight. Now, if we turn our efforts in that\r\ndirection, we ought to arrive, with the progress on science, at ten\r\ntimes the weight of the shot of Mahomet II. and the Knights of Malta.”\r\n\r\n“Clearly,” replied the major; “but what metal do you calculate upon\r\nemploying?”\r\n\r\n“Simply cast iron,” said General Morgan.\r\n\r\n“But,” interrupted the major, “since the weight of a shot is\r\nproportionate to its volume, an iron ball of nine feet in diameter\r\nwould be of tremendous weight.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if it were solid, not if it were hollow.”\r\n\r\n“Hollow? then it would be a shell?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a shell,” replied Barbicane; “decidely it must be. A solid shot\r\nof 108 inches would weigh more than 200,000 pounds, a weight evidently\r\nfar too great. Still, as we must reserve a certain stability for our\r\nprojectile, I propose to give it a weight of 20,000 pounds.”\r\n\r\n“What, then, will be the thickness of the sides?” asked the major.\r\n\r\n“If we follow the usual proportion,” replied Morgan, “a diameter of 108\r\ninches would require sides of two feet thickness, or less.”\r\n\r\n“That would be too much,” replied Barbicane; “for you will observe that\r\nthe question is not that of a shot intended to pierce an iron plate; it\r\nwill suffice to give it sides strong enough to resist the pressure of\r\nthe gas. The problem, therefore, is this—What thickness ought a\r\ncast-iron shell to have in order not to weight more than 20,000 pounds?\r\nOur clever secretary will soon enlighten us upon this point.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing easier.” replied the worthy secretary of the committee; and,\r\nrapidly tracing a few algebraical formulae upon paper, among which _n_2\r\nand _x_2 frequently appeared, he presently said:\r\n\r\n“The sides will require a thickness of less than two inches.”\r\n\r\n“Will that be enough?” asked the major doubtfully.\r\n\r\n“Clearly not!” replied the president.\r\n\r\n“What is to be done, then?” said Elphinstone, with a puzzled air.\r\n\r\n“Employ another metal instead of iron.”\r\n\r\n“Copper?” said Morgan.\r\n\r\n“No! that would be too heavy. I have better than that to offer.”\r\n\r\n“What then?” asked the major.\r\n\r\n“Aluminum!” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Aluminum?” cried his three colleagues in chorus.\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably, my friends. This valuable metal possesses the\r\nwhiteness of silver, the indestructibility of gold, the tenacity of\r\niron, the fusibility of copper, the lightness of glass. It is easily\r\nwrought, is very widely distributed, forming the base of most of the\r\nrocks, is three times lighter than iron, and seems to have been created\r\nfor the express purpose of furnishing us with the material for our\r\nprojectile.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear president,” said the major, “is not the cost price of\r\naluminum extremely high?”\r\n\r\n“It was so at its first discovery, but it has fallen now to nine\r\ndollars a pound.”\r\n\r\n“But still, nine dollars a pound!” replied the major, who was not\r\nwilling readily to give in; “even that is an enormous price.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, my dear major; but not beyond our reach.”\r\n\r\n“What will the projectile weigh then?” asked Morgan.\r\n\r\n“Here is the result of my calculations,” replied Barbicane. “A shot of\r\n108 inches in diameter, and twelve inches in thickness, would weigh, in\r\ncast-iron, 67,440 pounds; cast in aluminum, its weight will be reduced\r\nto 19,250 pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” cried the major; “but do you know that, at nine dollars a\r\npound, this projectile will cost—”\r\n\r\n“One hundred and seventy-three thousand and fifty dollars ($173,050). I\r\nknow it quite well. But fear not, my friends; the money will not be\r\nwanting for our enterprise. I will answer for it. Now what say you to\r\naluminum, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“Adopted!” replied the three members of the committee. So ended the\r\nfirst meeting. The question of the projectile was definitely settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nHISTORY OF THE CANNON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolutions passed at the last meeting produced a great effect out\r\nof doors. Timid people took fright at the idea of a shot weighing\r\n20,000 pounds being launched into space; they asked what cannon could\r\never transmit a sufficient velocity to such a mighty mass. The minutes\r\nof the second meeting were destined triumphantly to answer such\r\nquestions. The following evening the discussion was renewed.\r\n\r\n“My dear colleagues,” said Barbicane, without further preamble, “the\r\nsubject now before us is the construction of the engine, its length,\r\nits composition, and its weight. It is probable that we shall end by\r\ngiving it gigantic dimensions; but however great may be the\r\ndifficulties in the way, our mechanical genius will readily surmount\r\nthem. Be good enough, then, to give me your attention, and do not\r\nhesitate to make objections at the close. I have no fear of them. The\r\nproblem before us is how to communicate an initial force of 12,000\r\nyards per second to a shell of 108 inches in diameter, weighing 20,000\r\npounds. Now when a projectile is launched into space, what happens to\r\nit? It is acted upon by three independent forces: the resistance of the\r\nair, the attraction of the earth, and the force of impulsion with which\r\nit is endowed. Let us examine these three forces. The resistance of the\r\nair is of little importance. The atmosphere of the earth does not\r\nexceed forty miles. Now, with the given rapidity, the projectile will\r\nhave traversed this in five seconds, and the period is too brief for\r\nthe resistance of the medium to be regarded otherwise than as\r\ninsignificant. Proceding, then, to the attraction of the earth, that\r\nis, the weight of the shell, we know that this weight will diminish in\r\nthe inverse ratio of the square of the distance. When a body left to\r\nitself falls to the surface of the earth, it falls five feet in the\r\nfirst second; and if the same body were removed 257,542 miles further\r\noff, in other words, to the distance of the moon, its fall would be\r\nreduced to about half a line in the first second. That is almost\r\nequivalent to a state of perfect rest. Our business, then, is to\r\novercome progressively this action of gravitation. The mode of\r\naccomplishing that is by the force of impulsion.”\r\n\r\n“There’s the difficulty,” broke in the major.\r\n\r\n“True,” replied the president; “but we will overcome that, for the\r\nforce of impulsion will depend on the length of the engine and the\r\npowder employed, the latter being limited only by the resisting power\r\nof the former. Our business, then, to-day is with the dimensions of the\r\ncannon.”\r\n\r\n“Now, up to the present time,” said Barbicane, “our longest guns have\r\nnot exceeded twenty-five feet in length. We shall therefore astonish\r\nthe world by the dimensions we shall be obliged to adopt. It must\r\nevidently be, then, a gun of great range, since the length of the piece\r\nwill increase the detention of the gas accumulated behind the\r\nprojectile; but there is no advantage in passing certain limits.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” said the major. “What is the rule in such a case?”\r\n\r\n“Ordinarily the length of a gun is twenty to twenty-five times the\r\ndiameter of the shot, and its weight two hundred and thirty-five to two\r\nhundred and forty times that of the shot.”\r\n\r\n“That is not enough,” cried J. T. Maston impetuously.\r\n\r\n“I agree with you, my good friend; and, in fact, following this\r\nproportion for a projectile nine feet in diameter, weighing 30,000\r\npounds, the gun would only have a length of two hundred and twenty-\r\nfive feet, and a weight of 7,200,000 pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Ridiculous!” rejoined Maston. “As well take a pistol.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too,” replied Barbicane; “that is why I propose to\r\nquadruple that length, and to construct a gun of nine hundred feet.”\r\n\r\nThe general and the major offered some objections; nevertheless, the\r\nproposition, actively supported by the secretary, was definitely\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Elphinstone, “what thickness must we give it?”\r\n\r\n“A thickness of six feet,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“You surely don’t think of mounting a mass like that upon a carriage?”\r\nasked the major.\r\n\r\n“It would be a superb idea, though,” said Maston.\r\n\r\n“But impracticable,” replied Barbicane. “No, I think of sinking this\r\nengine in the earth alone, binding it with hoops of wrought iron, and\r\nfinally surrounding it with a thick mass of masonry of stone and\r\ncement. The piece once cast, it must be bored with great precision, so\r\nas to preclude any possible windage. So there will be no loss whatever\r\nof gas, and all the expansive force of the powder will be employed in\r\nthe propulsion.”\r\n\r\n“One simple question,” said Elphinstone: “is our gun to be rifled?”\r\n\r\n“No, certainly not,” replied Barbicane; “we require an enormous initial\r\nvelocity; and you are well aware that a shot quits a rifled gun less\r\nrapidly than it does a smooth-bore.”\r\n\r\n“True,” rejoined the major.\r\n\r\nThe committee here adjourned for a few minutes to tea and sandwiches.\r\n\r\nOn the discussion being renewed, “Gentlemen,” said Barbicane, “we must\r\nnow take into consideration the metal to be employed. Our cannon must\r\nbe possessed of great tenacity, great hardness, be infusible by heat,\r\nindissoluble, and inoxidable by the corrosive action of acids.”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt about that,” replied the major; “and as we shall\r\nhave to employ an immense quantity of metal, we shall not be at a loss\r\nfor choice.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Morgan, “I propose the best alloy hitherto known,\r\nwhich consists of one hundred parts of copper, twelve of tin, and six\r\nof brass.”\r\n\r\n“I admit,” replied the president, “that this composition has yielded\r\nexcellent results, but in the present case it would be too expensive,\r\nand very difficult to work. I think, then, that we ought to adopt a\r\nmaterial excellent in its way and of low price, such as cast iron. What\r\nis your advice, major?”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” replied Elphinstone.\r\n\r\n“In fact,” continued Barbicane, “cast iron costs ten times less than\r\nbronze; it is easy to cast, it runs readily from the moulds of sand, it\r\nis easy of manipulation, it is at once economical of money and of time.\r\nIn addition, it is excellent as a material, and I well remember that\r\nduring the war, at the siege of Atlanta, some iron guns fired one\r\nthousand rounds at intervals of twenty minutes without injury.”\r\n\r\n“Cast iron is very brittle, though,” replied Morgan.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but it possesses great resistance. I will now ask our worthy\r\nsecretary to calculate the weight of a cast-iron gun with a bore of\r\nnine feet and a thickness of six feet of metal.”\r\n\r\n“In a moment,” replied Maston. Then, dashing off some algebraical\r\nformulae with marvelous facility, in a minute or two he declared the\r\nfollowing result:\r\n\r\n“The cannon will weigh 68,040 tons. And, at two cents a pound, it will\r\ncost—”\r\n\r\n“Two million five hundred and ten thousand seven hundred and one\r\ndollars.”\r\n\r\nMaston, the major, and the general regarded Barbicane with uneasy\r\nlooks.\r\n\r\n“Well, gentlemen,” replied the president, “I repeat what I said\r\nyesterday. Make yourselves easy; the millions will not be wanting.”\r\n\r\nWith this assurance of their president the committee separated, after\r\nhaving fixed their third meeting for the following evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE POWDERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere remained for consideration merely the question of powders. The\r\npublic awaited with interest its final decision. The size of the\r\nprojectile, the length of the cannon being settled, what would be the\r\nquantity of powder necessary to produce impulsion?\r\n\r\nIt is generally asserted that gunpowder was invented in the fourteenth\r\ncentury by the monk Schwartz, who paid for his grand discovery with his\r\nlife. It is, however, pretty well proved that this story ought to be\r\nranked among the legends of the middle ages. Gunpowder was not invented\r\nby any one; it was the lineal successor of the Greek fire, which, like\r\nitself, was composed of sulfur and saltpeter. Few persons are\r\nacquainted with the mechanical power of gunpowder. Now this is\r\nprecisely what is necessary to be understood in order to comprehend the\r\nimportance of the question submitted to the committee.\r\n\r\nA litre of gunpowder weighs about two pounds; during combustion it\r\nproduces 400 litres of gas. This gas, on being liberated and acted upon\r\nby temperature raised to 2,400 degrees, occupies a space of 4,000\r\nlitres: consequently the volume of powder is to the volume of gas\r\nproduced by its combustion as 1 to 4,000. One may judge, therefore, of\r\nthe tremendous pressure on this gas when compressed within a space\r\n4,000 times too confined. All this was, of course, well known to the\r\nmembers of the committee when they met on the following evening.\r\n\r\nThe first speaker on this occasion was Major Elphinstone, who had been\r\nthe director of the gunpowder factories during the war.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said this distinguished chemist, “I begin with some\r\nfigures which will serve as the basis of our calculation. The old\r\n24-pounder shot required for its discharge sixteen pounds of powder.”\r\n\r\n“You are certain of this amount?” broke in Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Quite certain,” replied the major. “The Armstrong cannon employs only\r\nseventy-five pounds of powder for a projectile of eight hundred pounds,\r\nand the Rodman Columbiad uses only one hundred and sixty pounds of\r\npowder to send its half ton shot a distance of six miles. These facts\r\ncannot be called in question, for I myself raised the point during the\r\ndepositions taken before the committee of artillery.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” said the general.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the major, “these figures go to prove that the quantity\r\nof powder is not increased with the weight of the shot; that is to say,\r\nif a 24-pounder shot requires sixteen pounds of powder;—in other words,\r\nif in ordinary guns we employ a quantity of powder equal to two-thirds\r\nof the weight of the projectile, this proportion is not constant.\r\nCalculate, and you will see that in place of three hundred and\r\nthirty-three pounds of powder, the quantity is reduced to no more than\r\none hundred and sixty pounds.”\r\n\r\n“What are you aiming at?” asked the president.\r\n\r\n“If you push your theory to extremes, my dear major,” said J. T.\r\nMaston, “you will get to this, that as soon as your shot becomes\r\nsufficiently heavy you will not require any powder at all.”\r\n\r\n“Our friend Maston is always at his jokes, even in serious matters,”\r\ncried the major; “but let him make his mind easy, I am going presently\r\nto propose gunpowder enough to satisfy his artillerist’s propensities.\r\nI only keep to statistical facts when I say that, during the war, and\r\nfor the very largest guns, the weight of the powder was reduced, as the\r\nresult of experience, to a tenth part of the weight of the shot.”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly correct,” said Morgan; “but before deciding the quantity of\r\npowder necessary to give the impulse, I think it would be as well—”\r\n\r\n“We shall have to employ a large-grained powder,” continued the major;\r\n“its combustion is more rapid than that of the small.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt about that,” replied Morgan; “but it is very destructive, and\r\nends by enlarging the bore of the pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Granted; but that which is injurious to a gun destined to perform long\r\nservice is not so to our Columbiad. We shall run no danger of an\r\nexplosion; and it is necessary that our powder should take fire\r\ninstantaneously in order that its mechanical effect may be complete.”\r\n\r\n“We must have,” said Maston, “several touch-holes, so as to fire it at\r\ndifferent points at the same time.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Elphinstone; “but that will render the working of\r\nthe piece more difficult. I return then to my large-grained powder,\r\nwhich removes those difficulties. In his Columbiad charges Rodman\r\nemployed a powder as large as chestnuts, made of willow charcoal,\r\nsimply dried in cast- iron pans. This powder was hard and glittering,\r\nleft no trace upon the hand, contained hydrogen and oxygen in large\r\nproportion, took fire instantaneously, and, though very destructive,\r\ndid not sensibly injure the mouth-piece.”\r\n\r\nUp to this point Barbicane had kept aloof from the discussion; he left\r\nthe others to speak while he himself listened; he had evidently got an\r\nidea. He now simply said, “Well, my friends, what quantity of powder do\r\nyou propose?”\r\n\r\nThe three members looked at one another.\r\n\r\n“Two hundred thousand pounds.” at last said Morgan.\r\n\r\n“Five hundred thousand,” added the major.\r\n\r\n“Eight hundred thousand,” screamed Maston.\r\n\r\nA moment of silence followed this triple proposal; it was at last\r\nbroken by the president.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he quietly said, “I start from this principle, that the\r\nresistance of a gun, constructed under the given conditions, is\r\nunlimited. I shall surprise our friend Maston, then, by stigmatizing\r\nhis calculations as timid; and I propose to double his 800,000 pounds\r\nof powder.”\r\n\r\n“Sixteen hundred thousand pounds?” shouted Maston, leaping from his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n“Just so.”\r\n\r\n“We shall have to come then to my ideal of a cannon half a mile long;\r\nfor you see 1,600,000 pounds will occupy a space of about 20,000 cubic\r\nfeet; and since the contents of your cannon do not exceed 54,000 cubic\r\nfeet, it would be half full; and the bore will not be more than long\r\nenough for the gas to communicate to the projectile sufficient\r\nimpulse.”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” said the president, “I hold to that quantity of powder.\r\nNow, 1,600,000 pounds of powder will create 6,000,000,000 litres of\r\ngas. Six thousand millions! You quite understand?”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done then?” said the general.\r\n\r\n“The thing is very simple; we must reduce this enormous quantity of\r\npowder, while preserving to it its mechanical power.”\r\n\r\n“Good; but by what means?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to tell you,” replied Barbicane quietly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is more easy than to reduce this mass to one quarter of its\r\nbulk. You know that curious cellular matter which constitutes the\r\nelementary tissues of vegetable? This substance is found quite pure in\r\nmany bodies, especially in cotton, which is nothing more than the down\r\nof the seeds of the cotton plant. Now cotton, combined with cold nitric\r\nacid, become transformed into a substance eminently insoluble,\r\ncombustible, and explosive. It was first discovered in 1832, by\r\nBraconnot, a French chemist, who called it xyloidine. In 1838 another\r\nFrenchman, Pelouze, investigated its different properties, and finally,\r\nin 1846, Schonbein, professor of chemistry at Bale, proposed its\r\nemployment for purposes of war. This powder, now called pyroxyle, or\r\nfulminating cotton, is prepared with great facility by simply plunging\r\ncotton for fifteen minutes in nitric acid, then washing it in water,\r\nthen drying it, and it is ready for use.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be more simple,” said Morgan.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, pyroxyle is unaltered by moisture—a valuable property to us,\r\ninasmuch as it would take several days to charge the cannon. It ignites\r\nat 170 degrees in place of 240, and its combustion is so rapid that one\r\nmay set light to it on the top of the ordinary powder, without the\r\nlatter having time to ignite.”\r\n\r\n“Perfect!” exclaimed the major.\r\n\r\n“Only it is more expensive.”\r\n\r\n“What matter?” cried J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“Finally, it imparts to projectiles a velocity four times superior to\r\nthat of gunpowder. I will even add, that if we mix it with one-eighth\r\nof its own weight of nitrate of potassium, its expansive force is again\r\nconsiderably augmented.”\r\n\r\n“Will that be necessary?” asked the major.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” replied Barbicane. “So, then, in place of 1,600,000\r\npounds of powder, we shall have but 400,000 pounds of fulminating\r\ncotton; and since we can, without danger, compress 500 pounds of cotton\r\ninto twenty-seven cubic feet, the whole quantity will not occupy a\r\nheight of more than 180 feet within the bore of the Columbiad. In this\r\nway the shot will have more than 700 feet of bore to traverse under a\r\nforce of 6,000,000,000 litres of gas before taking its flight toward\r\nthe moon.”\r\n\r\nAt this juncture J. T. Maston could not repress his emotion; he flung\r\nhimself into the arms of his friend with the violence of a projectile,\r\nand Barbicane would have been stove in if he had not been boom-proof.\r\n\r\nThis incident terminated the third meeting of the committee.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his bold colleagues, to whom nothing seemed impossible,\r\nhad succeeding in solving the complex problems of projectile, cannon,\r\nand powder. Their plan was drawn up, and it only remained to put it\r\ninto execution.\r\n\r\n“A mere matter of detail, a bagatelle,” said J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nONE ENEMY _v._ TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American public took a lively interest in the smallest details of\r\nthe enterprise of the Gun Club. It followed day by day the discussion\r\nof the committee. The most simple preparations for the great\r\nexperiment, the questions of figures which it involved, the mechanical\r\ndifficulties to be resolved—in one word, the entire plan of work—roused\r\nthe popular excitement to the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nThe purely scientific attraction was suddenly intensified by the\r\nfollowing incident:\r\n\r\nWe have seen what legions of admirers and friends Barbicane’s project\r\nhad rallied round its author. There was, however, one single individual\r\nalone in all the States of the Union who protested against the attempt\r\nof the Gun Club. He attacked it furiously on every opportunity, and\r\nhuman nature is such that Barbicane felt more keenly the opposition of\r\nthat one man than he did the applause of all the others. He was well\r\naware of the motive of this antipathy, the origin of this solitary\r\nenmity, the cause of its personality and old standing, and in what\r\nrivalry of self-love it had its rise.\r\n\r\nThis persevering enemy the president of the Gun Club had never seen.\r\nFortunate that it was so, for a meeting between the two men would\r\ncertainly have been attended with serious consequences. This rival was\r\na man of science, like Barbicane himself, of a fiery, daring, and\r\nviolent disposition; a pure Yankee. His name was Captain Nicholl; he\r\nlived at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nMost people are aware of the curious struggle which arose during the\r\nFederal war between the guns and armor of iron-plated ships. The result\r\nwas the entire reconstruction of the navy of both the continents; as\r\nthe one grew heavier, the other became thicker in proportion. The\r\nMerrimac, the Monitor, the Tennessee, the Weehawken discharged enormous\r\nprojectiles themselves, after having been armor-clad against the\r\nprojectiles of others. In fact they did to others that which they would\r\nnot they should do to them—that grand principle of immortality upon\r\nwhich rests the whole art of war.\r\n\r\nNow if Barbicane was a great founder of shot, Nicholl was a great\r\nforger of plates; the one cast night and day at Baltimore, the other\r\nforged day and night at Philadelphia. As soon as ever Barbicane\r\ninvented a new shot, Nicholl invented a new plate; each followed a\r\ncurrent of ideas essentially opposed to the other. Happily for these\r\ncitizens, so useful to their country, a distance of from fifty to sixty\r\nmiles separated them from one another, and they had never yet met.\r\nWhich of these two inventors had the advantage over the other it was\r\ndifficult to decide from the results obtained. By last accounts,\r\nhowever, it would seem that the armor-plate would in the end have to\r\ngive way to the shot; nevertheless, there were competent judges who had\r\ntheir doubts on the point.\r\n\r\nAt the last experiment the cylindro-conical projectiles of Barbicane\r\nstuck like so many pins in the Nicholl plates. On that day the\r\nPhiladelphia iron-forger then believed himself victorious, and could\r\nnot evince contempt enough for his rival; but when the other afterward\r\nsubstituted for conical shot simple 600-pound shells, at very moderate\r\nvelocity, the captain was obliged to give in. In fact, these\r\nprojectiles knocked his best metal plate to shivers.\r\n\r\nMatters were at this stage, and victory seemed to rest with the shot,\r\nwhen the war came to an end on the very day when Nicholl had completed\r\na new armor-plate of wrought steel. It was a masterpiece of its kind,\r\nand bid defiance to all the projectiles of the world. The captain had\r\nit conveyed to the Polygon at Washington, challenging the president of\r\nthe Gun Club to break it. Barbicane, peace having been declared,\r\ndeclined to try the experiment.\r\n\r\nNicholl, now furious, offered to expose his plate to the shock of any\r\nshot, solid, hollow, round, or conical. Refused by the president, who\r\ndid not choose to compromise his last success.\r\n\r\nNicholl, disgusted by this obstinacy, tried to tempt Barbicane by\r\noffering him every chance. He proposed to fix the plate within two\r\nhundred yards of the gun. Barbicane still obstinate in refusal. A\r\nhundred yards? Not even seventy-five!\r\n\r\n“At fifty then!” roared the captain through the newspapers. “At\r\ntwenty-five yards! and I’ll stand behind!”\r\n\r\nBarbicane returned for answer that, even if Captain Nicholl would be so\r\ngood as to stand in front, he would not fire any more.\r\n\r\nNicholl could not contain himself at this reply; threw out hints of\r\ncowardice; that a man who refused to fire a cannon-shot was pretty near\r\nbeing afraid of it; that artillerists who fight at six miles distance\r\nare substituting mathematical formulae for individual courage.\r\n\r\nTo these insinuations Barbicane returned no answer; perhaps he never\r\nheard of them, so absorbed was he in the calculations for his great\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nWhen his famous communication was made to the Gun Club, the captain’s\r\nwrath passed all bounds; with his intense jealousy was mingled a\r\nfeeling of absolute impotence. How was he to invent anything to beat\r\nthis 900-feet Columbiad? What armor-plate could ever resist a\r\nprojectile of 30,000 pounds weight? Overwhelmed at first under this\r\nviolent shock, he by and by recovered himself, and resolved to crush\r\nthe proposal by weight of his arguments.\r\n\r\nHe then violently attacked the labors of the Gun Club, published a\r\nnumber of letters in the newspapers, endeavored to prove Barbicane\r\nignorant of the first principles of gunnery. He maintained that it was\r\nabsolutely impossible to impress upon any body whatever a velocity of\r\n12,000 yards per second; that even with such a velocity a projectile of\r\nsuch a weight could not transcend the limits of the earth’s atmosphere.\r\nFurther still, even regarding the velocity to be acquired, and granting\r\nit to be sufficient, the shell could not resist the pressure of the gas\r\ndeveloped by the ignition of 1,600,000 pounds of powder; and supposing\r\nit to resist that pressure, it would be less able to support that\r\ntemperature; it would melt on quitting the Columbiad, and fall back in\r\na red-hot shower upon the heads of the imprudent spectators.\r\n\r\nBarbicane continued his work without regarding these attacks.\r\n\r\nNicholl then took up the question in its other aspects. Without\r\ntouching upon its uselessness in all points of view, he regarded the\r\nexperiment as fraught with extreme danger, both to the citizens, who\r\nmight sanction by their presence so reprehensible a spectacle, and also\r\nto the towns in the neighborhood of this deplorable cannon. He also\r\nobserved that if the projectile did not succeed in reaching its\r\ndestination (a result absolutely impossible), it must inevitably fall\r\nback upon the earth, and that the shock of such a mass, multiplied by\r\nthe square of its velocity, would seriously endanger every point of the\r\nglobe. Under the circumstances, therefore, and without interfering with\r\nthe rights of free citizens, it was a case for the intervention of\r\nGovernment, which ought not to endanger the safety of all for the\r\npleasure of one individual.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all his arguments, however, Captain Nicholl remained alone\r\nin his opinion. Nobody listened to him, and he did not succeed in\r\nalienating a single admirer from the president of the Gun Club. The\r\nlatter did not even take the pains to refute the arguments of his\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nNicholl, driven into his last entrenchments, and not able to fight\r\npersonally in the cause, resolved to fight with money. He published,\r\ntherefore, in the Richmond _Inquirer_ a series of wagers, conceived in\r\nthese terms, and on an increasing scale:\r\n\r\nNo. 1 ($1,000).—That the necessary funds for the experiment of the Gun\r\nClub will not be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 ($2,000).—That the operation of casting a cannon of 900 feet is\r\nimpracticable, and cannot possibly succeed.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 ($3,000).—That is it impossible to load the Columbiad, and that\r\nthe pyroxyle will take fire spontaneously under the pressure of the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 ($4,000).—That the Columbiad will burst at the first fire.\r\n\r\nNo. 5 ($5,000).—That the shot will not travel farther than six miles,\r\nand that it will fall back again a few seconds after its discharge.\r\n\r\nIt was an important sum, therefore, which the captain risked in his\r\ninvincible obstinacy. He had no less than $15,000 at stake.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the importance of the challenge, on the 19th of May he\r\nreceived a sealed packet containing the following superbly laconic\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n“BALTIMORE, October 19.\r\n”Done.\r\n”BARBICANE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nFLORIDA AND TEXAS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne question remained yet to be decided; it was necessary to choose a\r\nfavorable spot for the experiment. According to the advice of the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge, the gun must be fired perpendicularly to the\r\nplane of the horizon, that is to say, toward the zenith. Now the moon\r\ndoes not traverse the zenith, except in places situated between 0° and\r\n28° of latitude. It became, then, necessary to determine exactly that\r\nspot on the globe where the immense Columbiad should be cast.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October, at a general meeting of the Gun Club, Barbicane\r\nproduced a magnificent map of the United States. “Gentlemen,” said he,\r\nin opening the discussion, “I presume that we are all agreed that this\r\nexperiment cannot and ought not to be tried anywhere but within the\r\nlimits of the soil of the Union. Now, by good fortune, certain\r\nfrontiers of the United States extend downward as far as the 28th\r\nparallel of the north latitude. If you will cast your eye over this\r\nmap, you will see that we have at our disposal the whole of the\r\nsouthern portion of Texas and Florida.”\r\n\r\nIt was finally agreed, then, that the Columbiad must be cast on the\r\nsoil of either Texas or Florida. The result, however, of this decision\r\nwas to create a rivalry entirely without precedent between the\r\ndifferent towns of these two States.\r\n\r\nThe 28th parallel, on reaching the American coast, traverses the\r\npeninsula of Florida, dividing it into two nearly equal portions. Then,\r\nplunging into the Gulf of Mexico, it subtends the arc formed by the\r\ncoast of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; then skirting Texas, off\r\nwhich it cuts an angle, it continues its course over Mexico, crosses\r\nthe Sonora, Old California, and loses itself in the Pacific Ocean. It\r\nwas, therefore, only those portions of Texas and Florida which were\r\nsituated below this parallel which came within the prescribed\r\nconditions of latitude.\r\n\r\nFlorida, in its southern part, reckons no cities of importance; it is\r\nsimply studded with forts raised against the roving Indians. One\r\nsolitary town, Tampa Town, was able to put in a claim in favor of its\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIn Texas, on the contrary, the towns are much more numerous and\r\nimportant. Corpus Christi, in the county of Nueces, and all the cities\r\nsituated on the Rio Bravo, Laredo, Comalites, San Ignacio on the Web,\r\nRio Grande City on the Starr, Edinburgh in the Hidalgo, Santa Rita,\r\nElpanda, Brownsville in the Cameron, formed an imposing league against\r\nthe pretensions of Florida. So, scarcely was the decision known, when\r\nthe Texan and Floridan deputies arrived at Baltimore in an incredibly\r\nshort space of time. From that very moment President Barbicane and the\r\ninfluential members of the Gun Club were besieged day and night by\r\nformidable claims. If seven cities of Greece contended for the honor of\r\nhaving given birth to a Homer, here were two entire States threatening\r\nto come to blows about the question of a cannon.\r\n\r\nThe rival parties promenaded the streets with arms in their hands; and\r\nat every occasion of their meeting a collision was to be apprehended\r\nwhich might have been attended with disastrous results. Happily the\r\nprudence and address of President Barbicane averted the danger. These\r\npersonal demonstrations found a division in the newspapers of the\r\ndifferent States. The New York _Herald_ and the _Tribune_ supported\r\nTexas, while the _Times_ and the _American Review_ espoused the cause\r\nof the Floridan deputies. The members of the Gun Club could not decide\r\nto which to give the preference.\r\n\r\nTexas produced its array of twenty-six counties; Florida replied that\r\ntwelve counties were better than twenty-six in a country only one-sixth\r\npart of the size.\r\n\r\nTexas plumed itself upon its 330,000 natives; Florida, with a far\r\nsmaller territory, boasted of being much more densely populated with\r\n56,000.\r\n\r\nThe Texans, through the columns of the _Herald_ claimed that some\r\nregard should be had to a State which grew the best cotton in all\r\nAmerica, produced the best green oak for the service of the navy, and\r\ncontained the finest oil, besides iron mines, in which the yield was\r\nfifty per cent. of pure metal.\r\n\r\nTo this the _American Review_ replied that the soil of Florida,\r\nalthough not equally rich, afforded the best conditions for the\r\nmoulding and casting of the Columbiad, consisting as it did of sand and\r\nargillaceous earth.\r\n\r\n“That may be all very well,” replied the Texans; “but you must first\r\nget to this country. Now the communications with Florida are difficult,\r\nwhile the coast of Texas offers the bay of Galveston, which possesses a\r\ncircumference of fourteen leagues, and is capable of containing the\r\nnavies of the entire world!”\r\n\r\n“A pretty notion truly,” replied the papers in the interest of Florida,\r\n“that of Galveston bay _below the 29th parallel!_ Have we not got the\r\nbay of Espiritu Santo, opening precisely upon _the 28th degree_, and by\r\nwhich ships can reach Tampa Town by direct route?”\r\n\r\n“A fine bay; half choked with sand!”\r\n\r\n“Choked yourselves!” returned the others.\r\n\r\nThus the war went on for several days, when Florida endeavored to draw\r\nher adversary away on to fresh ground; and one morning the _Times_\r\nhinted that, the enterprise being essentially American, it ought not to\r\nbe attempted upon other than purely American territory.\r\n\r\nTo these words Texas retorted, “American! are we not as much so as you?\r\nWere not Texas and Florida both incorporated into the Union in 1845?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” replied the _Times_; “but we have belonged to the\r\nAmericans ever since 1820.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” returned the _Tribune_; “after having been Spaniards or English\r\nfor two hundred years, you were sold to the United States for five\r\nmillion dollars!”\r\n\r\n“Well! and why need we blush for that? Was not Louisiana bought from\r\nNapoleon in 1803 at the price of sixteen million dollars?”\r\n\r\n“Scandalous!” roared the Texas deputies. “A wretched little strip of\r\ncountry like Florida to dare to compare itself to Texas, who, in place\r\nof selling herself, asserted her own independence, drove out the\r\nMexicans in March 2, 1846, and declared herself a federal republic\r\nafter the victory gained by Samuel Houston, on the banks of the San\r\nJacinto, over the troops of Santa Anna!—a country, in fine, which\r\nvoluntarily annexed itself to the United States of America!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; because it was afraid of the Mexicans!” replied Florida.\r\n\r\n“Afraid!” From this moment the state of things became intolerable. A\r\nsanguinary encounter seemed daily imminent between the two parties in\r\nthe streets of Baltimore. It became necessary to keep an eye upon the\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane knew not which way to look. Notes, documents,\r\nletters full of menaces showered down upon his house. Which side ought\r\nhe to take? As regarded the appropriation of the soil, the facility of\r\ncommunication, the rapidity of transport, the claims of both States\r\nwere evenly balanced. As for political prepossessions, they had nothing\r\nto do with the question.\r\n\r\nThis dead block had existed for some little time, when Barbicane\r\nresolved to get rid of it all at once. He called a meeting of his\r\ncolleagues, and laid before them a proposition which, it will be seen,\r\nwas profoundly sagacious.\r\n\r\n“On carefully considering,” he said, “what is going on now between\r\nFlorida and Texas, it is clear that the same difficulties will recur\r\nwith all the towns of the favored State. The rivalry will descend from\r\nState to city, and so on downward. Now Texas possesses eleven towns\r\nwithin the prescribed conditions, which will further dispute the honor\r\nand create us new enemies, while Florida has only one. I go in,\r\ntherefore, for Florida and Tampa Town.”\r\n\r\nThis decision, on being made known, utterly crushed the Texan deputies.\r\nSeized with an indescribable fury, they addressed threatening letters\r\nto the different members of the Gun Club by name. The magistrates had\r\nbut one course to take, and they took it. They chartered a special\r\ntrain, forced the Texans into it whether they would or no; and they\r\nquitted the city with a speed of thirty miles an hour.\r\n\r\nQuickly, however, as they were despatched, they found time to hurl one\r\nlast and bitter sarcasm at their adversaries.\r\n\r\nAlluding to the extent of Florida, a mere peninsula confined between\r\ntwo seas, they pretended that it could never sustain the shock of the\r\ndischarge, and that it would “bust up” at the very first shot.\r\n\r\n“Very well, let it bust up!” replied the Floridans, with a brevity of\r\nthe days of ancient Sparta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nURBI ET ORBI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe astronomical, mechanical, and topographical difficulties resolved,\r\nfinally came the question of finance. The sum required was far too\r\ngreat for any individual, or even any single State, to provide the\r\nrequisite millions.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane undertook, despite of the matter being a purely\r\nAmerican affair, to render it one of universal interest, and to request\r\nthe financial co-operation of all peoples. It was, he maintained, the\r\nright and duty of the whole earth to interfere in the affairs of its\r\nsatellite. The subscription opened at Baltimore extended properly to\r\nthe whole world—_Urbi et orbi_.\r\n\r\nThis subscription was successful beyond all expectation;\r\nnotwithstanding that it was a question not of lending but of giving the\r\nmoney. It was a purely disinterested operation in the strictest sense\r\nof the term, and offered not the slightest chance of profit.\r\n\r\nThe effect, however, of Barbicane’s communication was not confined to\r\nthe frontiers of the United States; it crossed the Atlantic and\r\nPacific, invading simultaneously Asia and Europe, Africa and Oceanica.\r\nThe observatories of the Union placed themselves in immediate\r\ncommunication with those of foreign countries. Some, such as those of\r\nParis, Petersburg, Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Malta, Lisbon, Benares,\r\nMadras, and others, transmitted their good wishes; the rest maintained\r\na prudent silence, quietly awaiting the result. As for the observatory\r\nat Greenwich, seconded as it was by the twenty- two astronomical\r\nestablishments of Great Britain, it spoke plainly enough. It boldly\r\ndenied the possibility of success, and pronounced in favor of the\r\ntheories of Captain Nicholl. But this was nothing more than mere\r\nEnglish jealousy.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of October President Barbicane published a manifesto full of\r\nenthusiasm, in which he made an appeal to “all persons of good will\r\nupon the face of the earth.” This document, translated into all\r\nlanguages, met with immense success.\r\n\r\nSubscription lists were opened in all the principal cities of the\r\nUnion, with a central office at the Baltimore Bank, 9 Baltimore Street.\r\n\r\nIn addition, subscriptions were received at the following banks in the\r\ndifferent states of the two continents:\r\n\r\nAt Vienna, with S. M. de Rothschild.\r\nAt Petersburg, Stieglitz and Co.\r\nAt Paris, The Credit Mobilier.\r\nAt Stockholm, Tottie and Arfuredson.\r\nAt London, N. M. Rothschild and Son.\r\nAt Turin, Ardouin and Co.\r\nAt Berlin, Mendelssohn.\r\nAt Geneva, Lombard, Odier and Co.\r\nAt Constantinople, The Ottoman Bank.\r\nAt Brussels, J. Lambert.\r\nAt Madrid, Daniel Weisweller.\r\nAt Amsterdam, Netherlands Credit Co.\r\nAt Rome, Torlonia and Co.\r\nAt Lisbon, Lecesne.\r\nAt Copenhagen, Private Bank.\r\nAt Rio de Janeiro, Private Bank.\r\nAt Montevideo, Private Bank.\r\nAt Valparaiso and Lima, Thomas la Chambre and Co.\r\nAt Mexico, Martin Daran and Co.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after the manifesto of President Barbicane $4,000,000 were\r\npaid into the different towns of the Union. With such a balance the Gun\r\nClub might begin operations at once. But some days later advices were\r\nreceived to the effect that foreign subscriptions were being eagerly\r\ntaken up. Certain countries distinguished themselves by their\r\nliberality; others untied their purse-strings with less facility—a\r\nmatter of temperament. Figures are, however, more eloquent than words,\r\nand here is the official statement of the sums which were paid in to\r\nthe credit of the Gun Club at the close of the subscription.\r\n\r\nRussia paid in as her contingent the enormous sum of 368,733 roubles.\r\nNo one need be surprised at this, who bears in mind the scientific\r\ntaste of the Russians, and the impetus which they have given to\r\nastronomical studies—thanks to their numerous observatories.\r\n\r\nFrance began by deriding the pretensions of the Americans. The moon\r\nserved as a pretext for a thousand stale puns and a score of ballads,\r\nin which bad taste contested the palm with ignorance. But as formerly\r\nthe French paid before singing, so now they paid after having had their\r\nlaugh, and they subscribed for a sum of 1,253,930 francs. At that price\r\nthey had a right to enjoy themselves a little.\r\n\r\nAustria showed herself generous in the midst of her financial crisis.\r\nHer public contributions amounted to the sum of 216,000 florins—a\r\nperfect godsend.\r\n\r\nFifty-two thousand rix-dollars were the remittance of Sweden and\r\nNorway; the amount is large for the country, but it would undoubtedly\r\nhave been considerably increased had the subscription been opened in\r\nChristiana simultaneously with that at Stockholm. For some reason or\r\nother the Norwegians do not like to send their money to Sweden.\r\n\r\nPrussia, by a remittance of 250,000 thalers, testified her high\r\napproval of the enterprise.\r\n\r\nTurkey behaved generously; but she had a personal interest in the\r\nmatter. The moon, in fact, regulates the cycle of her years and her\r\nfast of Ramadan. She could not do less than give 1,372,640 piastres;\r\nand she gave them with an eagerness which denoted, however, some\r\npressure on the part of the government.\r\n\r\nBelgium distinguished herself among the second-rate states by a grant\r\nof 513,000 francs—about two centimes per head of her population.\r\n\r\nHolland and her colonies interested themselves to the extent of 110,000\r\nflorins, only demanding an allowance of five per cent. discount for\r\npaying ready money.\r\n\r\nDenmark, a little contracted in territory, gave nevertheless 9,000\r\nducats, proving her love for scientific experiments.\r\n\r\nThe Germanic Confederation pledged itself to 34,285 florins. It was\r\nimpossible to ask for more; besides, they would not have given it.\r\n\r\nThough very much crippled, Italy found 200,000 lire in the pockets of\r\nher people. If she had had Venetia she would have done better; but she\r\nhad not.\r\n\r\nThe States of the Church thought that they could not send less than\r\n7,040 Roman crowns; and Portugal carried her devotion to science as far\r\nas 30,000 cruzados. It was the widow’s mite—eighty-six piastres; but\r\nself-constituted empires are always rather short of money.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and fifty-seven francs, this was the modest contribution of\r\nSwitzerland to the American work. One must freely admit that she did\r\nnot see the practical side of the matter. It did not seem to her that\r\nthe mere despatch of a shot to the moon could possibly establish any\r\nrelation of affairs with her; and it did not seem prudent to her to\r\nembark her capital in so hazardous an enterprise. After all, perhaps\r\nshe was right.\r\n\r\nAs to Spain, she could not scrape together more than 110 reals. She\r\ngave as an excuse that she had her railways to finish. The truth is,\r\nthat science is not favorably regarded in that country, it is still in\r\na backward state; and moreover, certain Spaniards, not by any means the\r\nleast educated, did not form a correct estimate of the bulk of the\r\nprojectile compared with that of the moon. They feared that it would\r\ndisturb the established order of things. In that case it were better to\r\nkeep aloof; which they did to the tune of some reals.\r\n\r\nThere remained but England; and we know the contemptuous antipathy with\r\nwhich she received Barbicane’s proposition. The English have but one\r\nsoul for the whole twenty-six millions of inhabitants which Great\r\nBritain contains. They hinted that the enterprise of the Gun Club was\r\ncontrary to the “principle of non-intervention.” And they did not\r\nsubscribe a single farthing.\r\n\r\nAt this intimation the Gun Club merely shrugged its shoulders and\r\nreturned to its great work. When South America, that is to say, Peru,\r\nChili, Brazil, the provinces of La Plata and Columbia, had poured forth\r\ntheir quota into their hands, the sum of $300,000, it found itself in\r\npossession of a considerable capital, of which the following is a\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n     United States subscriptions, . . $4,000,000\r\n     Foreign subscriptions . . . . . . . $1,446,675\r\n                                                  ——————\r\n            Total, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $5,446,675\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the sum which the public poured into the treasury of the Gun\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nLet no one be surprised at the vastness of the amount. The work of\r\ncasting, boring, masonry, the transport of workmen, their establishment\r\nin an almost uninhabited country, the construction of furnaces and\r\nworkshops, the plant, the powder, the projectile, and incipient\r\nexpenses, would, according to the estimates, absorb nearly the whole.\r\nCertain cannon-shots in the Federal war cost one thousand dollars\r\napiece. This one of President Barbicane, unique in the annals of\r\ngunnery, might well cost five thousand times more.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October a contract was entered into with the manufactory\r\nat Coldspring, near New York, which during the war had furnished the\r\nlargest Parrott, cast-iron guns. It was stipulated between the\r\ncontracting parties that the manufactory of Coldspring should engage to\r\ntransport to Tampa Town, in southern Florida, the necessary materials\r\nfor casting the Columbiad. The work was bound to be completed at latest\r\nby the 15th of October following, and the cannon delivered in good\r\ncondition under penalty of a forfeit of one hundred dollars a day to\r\nthe moment when the moon should again present herself under the same\r\nconditions—that is to say, in eighteen years and eleven days.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of the workmen, their pay, and all the necessary details\r\nof the work, devolved upon the Coldspring Company.\r\n\r\nThis contract, executed in duplicate, was signed by Barbicane,\r\npresident of the Gun Club, of the one part, and T. Murchison director\r\nof the Coldspring manufactory, of the other, who thus executed the deed\r\non behalf of their respective principals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nSTONES HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the decision was arrived at by the Gun Club, to the disparagement\r\nof Texas, every one in America, where reading is a universal\r\nacquirement, set to work to study the geography of Florida. Never\r\nbefore had there been such a sale for works like “Bertram’s Travels in\r\nFlorida,” “Roman’s Natural History of East and West Florida,”\r\n“William’s Territory of Florida,” and “Cleland on the Cultivation of\r\nthe Sugar-Cane in Florida.” It became necessary to issue fresh editions\r\nof these works.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had something better to do than to read. He desired to see\r\nthings with his own eyes, and to mark the exact position of the\r\nproposed gun. So, without a moment’s loss of time, he placed at the\r\ndisposal of the Cambridge Observatory the funds necessary for the\r\nconstruction of a telescope, and entered into negotiations with the\r\nhouse of Breadwill and Co., of Albany, for the construction of an\r\naluminum projectile of the required size. He then quitted Baltimore,\r\naccompanied by J. T. Maston, Major Elphinstone, and the manager of the\r\nColdspring factory.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, the four fellow-travelers arrived at New Orleans.\r\nThere they immediately embarked on board the _Tampico_, a despatch-boat\r\nbelonging to the Federal navy, which the government had placed at their\r\ndisposal; and, getting up steam, the banks of Louisiana speedily\r\ndisappeared from sight.\r\n\r\nThe passage was not long. Two days after starting, the _Tampico_,\r\nhaving made four hundred and eighty miles, came in sight of the coast\r\nof Florida. On a nearer approach Barbicane found himself in view of a\r\nlow, flat country of somewhat barren aspect. After coasting along a\r\nseries of creeks abounding in lobsters and oysters, the _Tampico_\r\nentered the bay of Espiritu Santo, where she finally anchored in a\r\nsmall natural harbor, formed by the _embouchure_ of the River\r\nHillisborough, at seven P.M., on the 22d of October.\r\n\r\nOur four passengers disembarked at once. “Gentlemen,” said Barbicane,\r\n“we have no time to lose; tomorrow we must obtain horses, and proceed\r\nto reconnoiter the country.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane had scarcely set his foot on shore when three thousand of the\r\ninhabitants of Tampa Town came forth to meet him, an honor due to the\r\npresident who had signalized their country by his choice.\r\n\r\nDeclining, however, every kind of ovation, Barbicane ensconced himself\r\nin a room of the Franklin Hotel.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow some of the small horses of the Spanish breed, full of\r\nvigor and of fire, stood snorting under his windows; but instead of\r\nfour steeds, here were fifty, together with their riders. Barbicane\r\ndescended with his three fellow- travelers; and much astonished were\r\nthey all to find themselves in the midst of such a cavalcade. He\r\nremarked that every horseman carried a carbine slung across his\r\nshoulders and pistols in his holsters.\r\n\r\nOn expressing his surprise at these preparations, he was speedily\r\nenlightened by a young Floridan, who quietly said:\r\n\r\n“Sir, there are Seminoles there.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by Seminoles?”\r\n\r\n“Savages who scour the prairies. We thought it best, therefore, to\r\nescort you on your road.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” cried J. T. Maston, mounting his steed.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said the Floridan; “but it is true enough, nevertheless.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” answered Barbicane, “I thank you for your kind attention;\r\nbut it is time to be off.”\r\n\r\nIt was five A.M. when Barbicane and his party, quitting Tampa Town,\r\nmade their way along the coast in the direction of Alifia Creek. This\r\nlittle river falls into Hillisborough Bay twelve miles above Tampa\r\nTown. Barbicane and his escort coasted along its right bank to the\r\neastward. Soon the waves of the bay disappeared behind a bend of rising\r\nground, and the Floridan “champagne” alone offered itself to view.\r\n\r\nFlorida, discovered on Palm Sunday, in 1512, by Juan Ponce de Leon, was\r\noriginally named _Pascha Florida_. It little deserved that designation,\r\nwith its dry and parched coasts. But after some few miles of tract the\r\nnature of the soil gradually changes and the country shows itself\r\nworthy of the name. Cultivated plains soon appear, where are united all\r\nthe productions of the northern and tropical floras, terminating in\r\nprairies abounding with pineapples and yams, tobacco, rice,\r\ncotton-plants, and sugar-canes, which extend beyond reach of sight,\r\nflinging their riches broadcast with careless prodigality.\r\n\r\nBarbicane appeared highly pleased on observing the progressive\r\nelevation of the land; and in answer to a question of J. T. Maston,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“My worthy friend, we cannot do better than sink our Columbiad in these\r\nhigh grounds.”\r\n\r\n“To get nearer the moon, perhaps?” said the secretary of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly,” replied Barbicane, smiling; “do you not see that among\r\nthese elevated plateaus we shall have a much easier work of it? No\r\nstruggles with the water-springs, which will save us long expensive\r\ntubings; and we shall be working in daylight instead of down a deep and\r\nnarrow well. Our business, then, is to open our trenches upon ground\r\nsome hundreds of yards above the level of the sea.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir,” struck in Murchison, the engineer; “and, if I\r\nmistake not, we shall ere long find a suitable spot for our purpose.”\r\n\r\n“I wish we were at the first stroke of the pickaxe,” said the\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n“And I wish we were at the _last_,” cried J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\nAbout ten A.M. the little band had crossed a dozen miles. To fertile\r\nplains succeeded a region of forests. There perfumes of the most varied\r\nkinds mingled together in tropical profusion. These almost impenetrable\r\nforests were composed of pomegranates, orange-trees, citrons, figs,\r\nolives, apricots, bananas, huge vines, whose blossoms and fruits\r\nrivaled each other in color and perfume. Beneath the odorous shade of\r\nthese magnificent trees fluttered and warbled a little world of\r\nbrilliantly plumaged birds.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston and the major could not repress their admiration on\r\nfinding themselves in the presence of the glorious beauties of this\r\nwealth of nature. President Barbicane, however, less sensitive to these\r\nwonders, was in haste to press forward; the very luxuriance of the\r\ncountry was displeasing to him. They hastened onward, therefore, and\r\nwere compelled to ford several rivers, not without danger, for they\r\nwere infested with huge alligators from fifteen to eighteen feet long.\r\nMaston courageously menaced them with his steel hook, but he only\r\nsucceeded in frightening some pelicans and teal, while tall flamingos\r\nstared stupidly at the party.\r\n\r\nAt length these denizens of the swamps disappeared in their turn;\r\nsmaller trees became thinly scattered among less dense thickets—a few\r\nisolated groups detached in the midst of endless plains over which\r\nranged herds of startled deer.\r\n\r\n“At last,” cried Barbicane, rising in his stirrups, “here we are at the\r\nregion of pines!”\r\n\r\n“Yes! and of savages too,” replied the major.\r\n\r\nIn fact, some Seminoles had just came in sight upon the horizon; they\r\nrode violently backward and forward on their fleet horses, brandishing\r\ntheir spears or discharging their guns with a dull report. These\r\nhostile demonstrations, however, had no effect upon Barbicane and his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThey were then occupying the center of a rocky plain, which the sun\r\nscorched with its parching rays. This was formed by a considerable\r\nelevation of the soil, which seemed to offer to the members of the Gun\r\nClub all the conditions requisite for the construction of their\r\nColumbiad.\r\n\r\n“Halt!” said Barbicane, reining up. “Has this place any local\r\nappellation?”\r\n\r\n“It is called Stones Hill,” replied one of the Floridans.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, without saying a word, dismounted, seized his instruments,\r\nand began to note his position with extreme exactness. The little band,\r\ndrawn up in the rear, watched his proceedings in profound silence.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sun passed the meridian. Barbicane, after a few\r\nmoments, rapidly wrote down the result of his observations, and said:\r\n\r\n“This spot is situated eighteen hundred feet above the level of the\r\nsea, in 27° 7′ N. lat. and 5° 7′ W. long. of the meridian of\r\nWashington. It appears to me by its rocky and barren character to offer\r\nall the conditions requisite for our experiment. On that plain will be\r\nraised our magazines, workshops, furnaces, and workmen’s huts; and\r\nhere, from this very spot,” said he, stamping his foot on the summit of\r\nStones Hill, “hence shall our projectile take its flight into the\r\nregions of the Solar World.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nPICKAXE AND TROWEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same evening Barbicane and his companions returned to Tampa Town;\r\nand Murchison, the engineer, re-embarked on board the Tampico for New\r\nOrleans. His object was to enlist an army of workmen, and to collect\r\ntogether the greater part of the materials. The members of the Gun Club\r\nremained at Tampa Town, for the purpose of setting on foot the\r\npreliminary works by the aid of the people of the country.\r\n\r\nEight days after its departure, the Tampico returned into the bay of\r\nEspiritu Santo, with a whole flotilla of steamboats. Murchison had\r\nsucceeded in assembling together fifteen hundred artisans. Attracted by\r\nthe high pay and considerable bounties offered by the Gun Club, he had\r\nenlisted a choice legion of stokers, iron-founders, lime-burners,\r\nminers, brickmakers, and artisans of every trade, without distinction\r\nof color. As many of these people brought their families with them,\r\ntheir departure resembled a perfect emigration.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October, at ten o’clock in the morning, the troop\r\ndisembarked on the quays of Tampa Town; and one may imagine the\r\nactivity which pervaded that little town, whose population was thus\r\ndoubled in a single day.\r\n\r\nDuring the first few days they were busy discharging the cargo brought\r\nby the flotilla, the machines, and the rations, as well as a large\r\nnumber of huts constructed of iron plates, separately pieced and\r\nnumbered. At the same period Barbicane laid the first sleepers of a\r\nrailway fifteen miles in length, intended to unite Stones Hill with\r\nTampa Town. On the first of November Barbicane quitted Tampa Town with\r\na detachment of workmen; and on the following day the whole town of\r\nhuts was erected round Stones Hill. This they enclosed with palisades;\r\nand in respect of energy and activity, it might have been mistaken for\r\none of the great cities of the Union. Everything was placed under a\r\ncomplete system of discipline, and the works were commenced in most\r\nperfect order.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the soil having been carefully examined, by means of\r\nrepeated borings, the work of excavation was fixed for the 4th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nOn that day Barbicane called together his foremen and addressed them as\r\nfollows: “You are well aware, my friends, of the object with which I\r\nhave assembled you together in this wild part of Florida. Our business\r\nis to construct a cannon measuring nine feet in its interior diameter,\r\nsix feet thick, and with a stone revetment of nineteen and a half feet\r\nin thickness. We have, therefore, a well of sixty feet in diameter to\r\ndig down to a depth of nine hundred feet. This great work must be\r\ncompleted within eight months, so that you have 2,543,400 cubic feet of\r\nearth to excavate in 255 days; that is to say, in round numbers, 2,000\r\ncubic feet per day. That which would present no difficulty to a\r\nthousand navvies working in open country will be of course more\r\ntroublesome in a comparatively confined space. However, the thing must\r\nbe done, and I reckon for its accomplishment upon your courage as much\r\nas upon your skill.”\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock the next morning the first stroke of the pickaxe was\r\nstruck upon the soil of Florida; and from that moment that prince of\r\ntools was never inactive for one moment in the hands of the excavators.\r\nThe gangs relieved each other every three hours.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November fifty workmen commenced digging, in the very\r\ncenter of the enclosed space on the summit of Stones Hill, a circular\r\nhole sixty feet in diameter. The pickaxe first struck upon a kind of\r\nblack earth, six inches in thickness, which was speedily disposed of.\r\nTo this earth succeeded two feet of fine sand, which was carefully laid\r\naside as being valuable for serving the casting of the inner mould.\r\nAfter the sand appeared some compact white clay, resembling the chalk\r\nof Great Britain, which extended down to a depth of four feet. Then the\r\niron of the picks struck upon the hard bed of the soil; a kind of rock\r\nformed of petrified shells, very dry, very solid, and which the picks\r\ncould with difficulty penetrate. At this point the excavation exhibited\r\na depth of six and a half feet and the work of the masonry was begun.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the excavation they constructed a wheel of oak, a kind\r\nof circle strongly bolted together, and of immense strength. The center\r\nof this wooden disc was hollowed out to a diameter equal to the\r\nexterior diameter of the Columbiad. Upon this wheel rested the first\r\nlayers of the masonry, the stones of which were bound together by\r\nhydraulic cement, with irresistible tenacity. The workmen, after laying\r\nthe stones from the circumference to the center, were thus enclosed\r\nwithin a kind of well twenty-one feet in diameter. When this work was\r\naccomplished, the miners resumed their picks and cut away the rock from\r\nunderneath the wheel itself, taking care to support it as they advanced\r\nupon blocks of great thickness. At every two feet which the hole gained\r\nin depth they successively withdrew the blocks. The wheel then sank\r\nlittle by little, and with it the massive ring of masonry, on the upper\r\nbed of which the masons labored incessantly, always reserving some vent\r\nholes to permit the escape of gas during the operation of the casting.\r\n\r\nThis kind of work required on the part of the workmen extreme nicety\r\nand minute attention. More than one, in digging underneath the wheel,\r\nwas dangerously injured by the splinters of stone. But their ardor\r\nnever relaxed, night or day. By day they worked under the rays of the\r\nscorching sun; by night, under the gleam of the electric light. The\r\nsounds of the picks against the rock, the bursting of mines, the\r\ngrinding of the machines, the wreaths of smoke scattered through the\r\nair, traced around Stones Hill a circle of terror which the herds of\r\nbuffaloes and the war parties of the Seminoles never ventured to pass.\r\nNevertheless, the works advanced regularly, as the steam-cranes\r\nactively removed the rubbish. Of unexpected obstacles there was little\r\naccount; and with regard to foreseen difficulties, they were speedily\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of the first month the well had attained the depth\r\nassigned for that lapse of time, namely, 112 feet. This depth was\r\ndoubled in December, and trebled in January.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of February the workmen had to contend with a sheet of\r\nwater which made its way right across the outer soil. It became\r\nnecessary to employ very powerful pumps and compressed-air engines to\r\ndrain it off, so as to close up the orifice from whence it issued; just\r\nas one stops a leak on board ship. They at last succeeded in getting\r\nthe upper hand of these untoward streams; only, in consequence of the\r\nloosening of the soil, the wheel partly gave way, and a slight partial\r\nsettlement ensued. This accident cost the life of several workmen.\r\n\r\nNo fresh occurrence thenceforward arrested the progress of the\r\noperation; and on the tenth of June, twenty days before the expiration\r\nof the period fixed by Barbicane, the well, lined throughout with its\r\nfacing of stone, had attained the depth of 900 feet. At the bottom the\r\nmasonry rested upon a massive block measuring thirty feet in thickness,\r\nwhile on the upper portion it was level with the surrounding soil.\r\n\r\nPresident Barbicane and the members of the Gun Club warmly\r\ncongratulated their engineer Murchison; the cyclopean work had been\r\naccomplished with extraordinary rapidity.\r\n\r\nDuring these eight months Barbicane never quitted Stones Hill for a\r\nsingle instant. Keeping ever close by the work of excavation, he busied\r\nhimself incessantly with the welfare and health of his workpeople, and\r\nwas singularly fortunate in warding off the epidemics common to large\r\ncommunities of men, and so disastrous in those regions of the globe\r\nwhich are exposed to the influences of tropical climates.\r\n\r\nMany workmen, it is true, paid with their lives for the rashness\r\ninherent in these dangerous labors; but these mishaps are impossible to\r\nbe avoided, and they are classed among the details with which the\r\nAmericans trouble themselves but little. They have in fact more regard\r\nfor human nature in general than for the individual in particular.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Barbicane professed opposite principles to these, and put\r\nthem in force at every opportunity. So, thanks to his care, his\r\nintelligence, his useful intervention in all difficulties, his\r\nprodigious and humane sagacity, the average of accidents did not exceed\r\nthat of transatlantic countries, noted for their excessive\r\nprecautions—France, for instance, among others, where they reckon about\r\none accident for every two hundred thousand francs of work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nTHE FETE OF THE CASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the eight months which were employed in the work of excavation\r\nthe preparatory works of the casting had been carried on simultaneously\r\nwith extreme rapidity. A stranger arriving at Stones Hill would have\r\nbeen surprised at the spectacle offered to his view.\r\n\r\nAt 600 yards from the well, and circularly arranged around it as a\r\ncentral point, rose 1,200 reverberating ovens, each six feet in\r\ndiameter, and separated from each other by an interval of three feet.\r\nThe circumference occupied by these 1,200 ovens presented a length of\r\ntwo miles. Being all constructed on the same plan, each with its high\r\nquadrangular chimney, they produced a most singular effect.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that on their third meeting the committee had\r\ndecided to use cast iron for the Columbiad, and in particular the white\r\ndescription. This metal, in fact, is the most tenacious, the most\r\nductile, and the most malleable, and consequently suitable for all\r\nmoulding operations; and when smelted with pit coal, is of superior\r\nquality for all engineering works requiring great resisting power, such\r\nas cannon, steam boilers, hydraulic presses, and the like.\r\n\r\nCast iron, however, if subjected to only one single fusion, is rarely\r\nsufficiently homogeneous; and it requires a second fusion completely to\r\nrefine it by dispossessing it of its last earthly deposits. So long\r\nbefore being forwarded to Tampa Town, the iron ore, molten in the great\r\nfurnaces of Coldspring, and brought into contact with coal and silicium\r\nheated to a high temperature, was carburized and transformed into cast\r\niron. After this first operation, the metal was sent on to Stones Hill.\r\nThey had, however, to deal with 136,000,000 pounds of iron, a quantity\r\nfar too costly to send by railway. The cost of transport would have\r\nbeen double that of material. It appeared preferable to freight vessels\r\nat New York, and to load them with the iron in bars. This, however,\r\nrequired not less than sixty- eight vessels of 1,000 tons, a veritable\r\nfleet, which, quitting New York on the 3rd of May, on the 10th of the\r\nsame month ascended the Bay of Espiritu Santo, and discharged their\r\ncargoes, without dues, in the port at Tampa Town. Thence the iron was\r\ntransported by rail to Stones Hill, and about the middle of January\r\nthis enormous mass of metal was delivered at its destination.\r\n\r\nIt will easily be understood that 1,200 furnaces were not too many to\r\nmelt simultaneously these 60,000 tons of iron. Each of these furnaces\r\ncontained nearly 140,000 pounds weight of metal. They were all built\r\nafter the model of those which served for the casting of the Rodman\r\ngun; they were trapezoidal in shape, with a high elliptical arch. These\r\nfurnaces, constructed of fireproof brick, were especially adapted for\r\nburning pit coal, with a flat bottom upon which the iron bars were\r\nlaid. This bottom, inclined at an angle of 25 degrees, allowed the\r\nmetal to flow into the receiving troughs; and the 1,200 converging\r\ntrenches carried the molten metal down to the central well.\r\n\r\nThe day following that on which the works of the masonry and boring had\r\nbeen completed, Barbicane set to work upon the central mould. His\r\nobject now was to raise within the center of the well, and with a\r\ncoincident axis, a cylinder 900 feet high, and nine feet in diameter,\r\nwhich should exactly fill up the space reserved for the bore of the\r\nColumbiad. This cylinder was composed of a mixture of clay and sand,\r\nwith the addition of a little hay and straw. The space left between the\r\nmould and the masonry was intended to be filled up by the molten metal,\r\nwhich would thus form the walls six feet in thickness. This cylinder,\r\nin order to maintain its equilibrium, had to be bound by iron bands,\r\nand firmly fixed at certain intervals by cross-clamps fastened into the\r\nstone lining; after the castings these would be buried in the block of\r\nmetal, leaving no external projection.\r\n\r\nThis operation was completed on the 8th of July, and the run of the\r\nmetal was fixed for the following day.\r\n\r\n“This _fete_ of the casting will be a grand ceremony,” said J. T.\r\nMaston to his friend Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” said Barbicane; “but it will not be a public _fete_“\r\n\r\n“What! will you not open the gates of the enclosure to all comers?”\r\n\r\n“I must be very careful, Maston. The casting of the Columbiad is an\r\nextremely delicate, not to say a dangerous operation, and I should\r\nprefer its being done privately. At the discharge of the projectile, a\r\n_fete_ if you like—till then, no!”\r\n\r\nThe president was right. The operation involved unforeseen dangers,\r\nwhich a great influx of spectators would have hindered him from\r\naverting. It was necessary to preserve complete freedom of movement. No\r\none was admitted within the enclosure except a delegation of members of\r\nthe Gun Club, who had made the voyage to Tampa Town. Among these was\r\nthe brisk Bilsby, Tom Hunter, Colonel Blomsberry, Major Elphinstone,\r\nGeneral Morgan, and the rest of the lot to whom the casting of the\r\nColumbiad was a matter of personal interest. J. T. Maston became their\r\ncicerone. He omitted no point of detail; he conducted them throughout\r\nthe magazines, workshops, through the midst of the engines, and\r\ncompelled them to visit the whole 1,200 furnaces one after the other.\r\nAt the end of the twelve-hundredth visit they were pretty well knocked\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe casting was to take place at twelve o’clock precisely. The previous\r\nevening each furnace had been charged with 114,000 pounds weight of\r\nmetal in bars disposed cross-ways to each other, so as to allow the hot\r\nair to circulate freely between them. At daybreak the 1,200 chimneys\r\nvomited their torrents of flame into the air, and the ground was\r\nagitated with dull tremblings. As many pounds of metal as there were to\r\ncast, so many pounds of coal were there to burn. Thus there were 68,000\r\ntons of coal which projected in the face of the sun a thick curtain of\r\nsmoke. The heat soon became insupportable within the circle of\r\nfurnaces, the rumbling of which resembled the rolling of thunder. The\r\npowerful ventilators added their continuous blasts and saturated with\r\noxygen the glowing plates. The operation, to be successful, required to\r\nbe conducted with great rapidity. On a signal given by a cannon-shot\r\neach furnace was to give vent to the molten iron and completely to\r\nempty itself. These arrangements made, foremen and workmen waited the\r\npreconcerted moment with an impatience mingled with a certain amount of\r\nemotion. Not a soul remained within the enclosure. Each superintendent\r\ntook his post by the aperture of the run.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his colleagues, perched on a neighboring eminence,\r\nassisted at the operation. In front of them was a piece of artillery\r\nready to give fire on the signal from the engineer. Some minutes before\r\nmidday the first driblets of metal began to flow; the reservoirs filled\r\nlittle by little; and, by the time that the whole melting was\r\ncompletely accomplished, it was kept in abeyance for a few minutes in\r\norder to facilitate the separation of foreign substances.\r\n\r\nTwelve o’clock struck! A gunshot suddenly pealed forth and shot its\r\nflame into the air. Twelve hundred melting-troughs were simultaneously\r\nopened and twelve hundred fiery serpents crept toward the central well,\r\nunrolling their incandescent curves. There, down they plunged with a\r\nterrific noise into a depth of 900 feet. It was an exciting and a\r\nmagnificent spectacle. The ground trembled, while these molten waves,\r\nlaunching into the sky their wreaths of smoke, evaporated the moisture\r\nof the mould and hurled it upward through the vent-holes of the stone\r\nlining in the form of dense vapor-clouds. These artificial clouds\r\nunrolled their thick spirals to a height of 1,000 yards into the air. A\r\nsavage, wandering somewhere beyond the limits of the horizon, might\r\nhave believed that some new crater was forming in the bosom of Florida,\r\nalthough there was neither any eruption, nor typhoon, nor storm, nor\r\nstruggle of the elements, nor any of those terrible phenomena which\r\nnature is capable of producing. No, it was man alone who had produced\r\nthese reddish vapors, these gigantic flames worthy of a volcano itself,\r\nthese tremendous vibrations resembling the shock of an earthquake,\r\nthese reverberations rivaling those of hurricanes and storms; and it\r\nwas his hand which precipitated into an abyss, dug by himself, a whole\r\nNiagara of molten metal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nTHE COLUMBIAD\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the casting succeeded? They were reduced to mere conjecture. There\r\nwas indeed every reason to expect success, since the mould has absorbed\r\nthe entire mass of the molten metal; still some considerable time must\r\nelapse before they could arrive at any certainty upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe patience of the members of the Gun Club was sorely tried during\r\nthis period of time. But they could do nothing. J. T. Maston escaped\r\nroasting by a miracle. Fifteen days after the casting an immense column\r\nof smoke was still rising in the open sky and the ground burned the\r\nsoles of the feet within a radius of two hundred feet round the summit\r\nof Stones Hill. It was impossible to approach nearer. All they could do\r\nwas to wait with what patience they might.\r\n\r\n“Here we are at the 10th of August,” exclaimed J. T. Maston one\r\nmorning, “only four months to the 1st of December! We shall never be\r\nready in time!” Barbicane said nothing, but his silence covered serious\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nHowever, daily observations revealed a certain change going on in the\r\nstate of the ground. About the 15th of August the vapors ejected had\r\nsensibly diminished in intensity and thickness. Some days afterward the\r\nearth exhaled only a slight puff of smoke, the last breath of the\r\nmonster enclosed within its circle of stone. Little by little the belt\r\nof heat contracted, until on the 22nd of August, Barbicane, his\r\ncolleagues, and the engineer were enabled to set foot on the iron sheet\r\nwhich lay level upon the summit of Stones Hill.\r\n\r\n“At last!” exclaimed the president of the Gun Club, with an immense\r\nsigh of relief.\r\n\r\nThe work was resumed the same day. They proceeded at once to extract\r\nthe interior mould, for the purpose of clearing out the boring of the\r\npiece. Pickaxes and boring irons were set to work without intermission.\r\nThe clayey and sandy soils had acquired extreme hardness under the\r\naction of the heat; but, by the aid of the machines, the rubbish on\r\nbeing dug out was rapidly carted away on railway wagons; and such was\r\nthe ardor of the work, so persuasive the arguments of Barbicane’s\r\ndollars, that by the 3rd of September all traces of the mould had\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nImmediately the operation of boring was commenced; and by the aid of\r\npowerful machines, a few weeks later, the inner surface of the immense\r\ntube had been rendered perfectly cylindrical, and the bore of the piece\r\nhad acquired a thorough polish.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 22d of September, less than a twelvemonth after\r\nBarbicane’s original proposition, the enormous weapon, accurately\r\nbored, and exactly vertically pointed, was ready for work. There was\r\nonly the moon now to wait for; and they were pretty sure that she would\r\nnot fail in the rendezvous.\r\n\r\nThe ecstasy of J. T. Maston knew no bounds, and he narrowly escaped a\r\nfrightful fall while staring down the tube. But for the strong hand of\r\nColonel Blomsberry, the worthy secretary, like a modern Erostratus,\r\nwould have found his death in the depths of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nThe cannon was then finished; there was no possible doubt as to its\r\nperfect completion. So, on the 6th of October, Captain Nicholl opened\r\nan account between himself and President Barbicane, in which he debited\r\nhimself to the latter in the sum of two thousand dollars. One may\r\nbelieve that the captain’s wrath was increased to its highest point,\r\nand must have made him seriously ill. However, he had still three bets\r\nof three, four, and five thousand dollars, respectively; and if he\r\ngained two out of these, his position would not be very bad. But the\r\nmoney question did not enter into his calculations; it was the success\r\nof his rival in casting a cannon against which iron plates sixty feet\r\nthick would have been ineffectual, that dealt him a terrible blow.\r\n\r\nAfter the 23rd of September the enclosure of Stones hill was thrown\r\nopen to the public; and it will be easily imagined what was the\r\nconcourse of visitors to this spot! There was an incessant flow of\r\npeople to and from Tampa Town and the place, which resembled a\r\nprocession, or rather, in fact, a pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nIt was already clear to be seen that, on the day of the experiment\r\nitself, the aggregate of spectators would be counted by millions; for\r\nthey were already arriving from all parts of the earth upon this narrow\r\nstrip of promontory. Europe was emigrating to America.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, however, it must be confessed, the curiosity of the\r\nnumerous comers was but scantily gratified. Most had counted upon\r\nwitnessing the spectacle of the casting, and they were treated to\r\nnothing but smoke. This was sorry food for hungry eyes; but Barbicane\r\nwould admit no one to that operation. Then ensued grumbling,\r\ndiscontent, murmurs; they blamed the president, taxed him with\r\ndictatorial conduct. His proceedings were declared “un-American.” There\r\nwas very nearly a riot round Stones Hill; but Barbicane remained\r\ninflexible. When, however, the Columbiad was entirely finished, this\r\nstate of closed doors could no longer be maintained; besides it would\r\nhave been bad taste, and even imprudence, to affront the public\r\nfeeling. Barbicane, therefore, opened the enclosure to all comers; but,\r\ntrue to his practical disposition, he determined to coin money out of\r\nthe public curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt was something, indeed, to be enabled to contemplate this immense\r\nColumbiad; but to descend into its depths, this seemed to the Americans\r\nthe _ne plus ultra_ of earthly felicity. Consequently, there was not\r\none curious spectator who was not willing to give himself the treat of\r\nvisiting the interior of this great metallic abyss. Baskets suspended\r\nfrom steam-cranes permitted them to satisfy their curiosity. There was\r\na perfect mania. Women, children, old men, all made it a point of duty\r\nto penetrate the mysteries of the colossal gun. The fare for the\r\ndescent was fixed at five dollars per head; and despite this high\r\ncharge, during the two months which preceded the experiment, the influx\r\nof visitors enabled the Gun Club to pocket nearly five hundred thousand\r\ndollars!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the first visitors of the Columbiad were the\r\nmembers of the Gun Club. This privilege was justly reserved for that\r\nillustrious body. The ceremony took place on the 25th of September. A\r\nbasket of honor took down the president, J. T. Maston, Major\r\nElphinstone, General Morgan, Colonel Blomsberry, and other members of\r\nthe club, to the number of ten in all. How hot it was at the bottom of\r\nthat long tube of metal! They were half suffocated. But what delight!\r\nWhat ecstasy! A table had been laid with six covers on the massive\r\nstone which formed the bottom of the Columbiad, and lighted by a jet of\r\nelectric light resembling that of day itself. Numerous exquisite\r\ndishes, which seemed to descend from heaven, were placed successively\r\nbefore the guests, and the richest wines of France flowed in profusion\r\nduring this splendid repast, served nine hundred feet beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth!\r\n\r\nThe festival was animated, not to say somewhat noisy. Toasts flew\r\nbackward and forward. They drank to the earth and to her satellite, to\r\nthe Gun Club, the Union, the Moon, Diana, Phoebe, Selene, the “peaceful\r\ncourier of the night!” All the hurrahs, carried upward upon the\r\nsonorous waves of the immense acoustic tube, arrived with the sound of\r\nthunder at its mouth; and the multitude ranged round Stones Hill\r\nheartily united their shouts with those of the ten revelers hidden from\r\nview at the bottom of the gigantic Columbiad.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston was no longer master of himself. Whether he shouted or\r\ngesticulated, ate or drank most, would be a difficult matter to\r\ndetermine. At all events, he would not have given his place up for an\r\nempire, “not even if the cannon—loaded, primed, and fired at that very\r\nmoment—were to blow him in pieces into the planetary world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nA TELEGRAPHIC DISPATCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great works undertaken by the Gun Club had now virtually come to an\r\nend; and two months still remained before the day for the discharge of\r\nthe shot to the moon. To the general impatience these two months\r\nappeared as long as years! Hitherto the smallest details of the\r\noperation had been daily chronicled by the journals, which the public\r\ndevoured with eager eyes.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment a circumstance, the most unexpected, the most\r\nextraordinary and incredible, occurred to rouse afresh their panting\r\nspirits, and to throw every mind into a state of the most violent\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nOne day, the 30th of September, at 3:47 P.M., a telegram, transmitted\r\nby cable from Valentia (Ireland) to Newfoundland and the American\r\nMainland, arrived at the address of President Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe president tore open the envelope, read the dispatch, and, despite\r\nhis remarkable powers of self-control, his lips turned pale and his\r\neyes grew dim, on reading the twenty words of this telegram.\r\n\r\nHere is the text of the dispatch, which figures now in the archives of\r\nthe Gun Club:\r\n\r\nFRANCE, PARIS,\r\n30 September, 4 A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Barbicane, Tampa Town, Florida, United States.\r\n    Substitute for your spherical shell a cylindro-conical projectile.\r\n    I shall go inside. Shall arrive by steamer Atlanta.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHEL ARDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nTHE PASSENGER OF THE ATLANTA\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this astounding news, instead of flying through the electric wires,\r\nhad simply arrived by post in the ordinary sealed envelope, Barbicane\r\nwould not have hesitated a moment. He would have held his tongue about\r\nit, both as a measure of prudence, and in order not to have to\r\nreconsider his plans. This telegram might be a cover for some jest,\r\nespecially as it came from a Frenchman. What human being would ever\r\nhave conceived the idea of such a journey? and, if such a person really\r\nexisted, he must be an idiot, whom one would shut up in a lunatic ward,\r\nrather than within the walls of the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the dispatch, however, speedily became known; for the\r\ntelegraphic officials possessed but little discretion, and Michel\r\nArdan’s proposition ran at once throughout the several States of the\r\nUnion. Barbicane, had, therefore, no further motives for keeping\r\nsilence. Consequently, he called together such of his colleagues as\r\nwere at the moment in Tampa Town, and without any expression of his own\r\nopinions simply read to them the laconic text itself. It was received\r\nwith every possible variety of expressions of doubt, incredulity, and\r\nderision from every one, with the exception of J. T. Maston, who\r\nexclaimed, “It is a grand idea, however!”\r\n\r\nWhen Barbicane originally proposed to send a shot to the moon every one\r\nlooked upon the enterprise as simple and practicable enough—a mere\r\nquestion of gunnery; but when a person, professing to be a reasonable\r\nbeing, offered to take passage within the projectile, the whole thing\r\nbecame a farce, or, in plainer language a humbug.\r\n\r\nOne question, however, remained. Did such a being exist? This telegram\r\nflashed across the depths of the Atlantic, the designation of the\r\nvessel on board which he was to take his passage, the date assigned for\r\nhis speedy arrival, all combined to impart a certain character of\r\nreality to the proposal. They must get some clearer notion of the\r\nmatter. Scattered groups of inquirers at length condensed themselves\r\ninto a compact crowd, which made straight for the residence of\r\nPresident Barbicane. That worthy individual was keeping quiet with the\r\nintention of watching events as they arose. But he had forgotten to\r\ntake into account the public impatience; and it was with no pleasant\r\ncountenance that he watched the population of Tampa Town gathering\r\nunder his windows. The murmurs and vociferations below presently\r\nobliged him to appear. He came forward, therefore, and on silence being\r\nprocured, a citizen put point-blank to him the following question: “Is\r\nthe person mentioned in the telegram, under the name of Michel Ardan,\r\non his way here? Yes or no.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” replied Barbicane, “I know no more than you do.”\r\n\r\n“We must know,” roared the impatient voices.\r\n\r\n“Time will show,” calmly replied the president.\r\n\r\n“Time has no business to keep a whole country in suspense,” replied the\r\norator. “Have you altered the plans of the projectile according to the\r\nrequest of the telegram?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, gentlemen; but you are right! we must have better information\r\nto go by. The telegraph must complete its information.”\r\n\r\n“To the telegraph!” roared the crowd.\r\n\r\nBarbicane descended; and heading the immense assemblage, led the way to\r\nthe telegraph office. A few minutes later a telegram was dispatched to\r\nthe secretary of the underwriters at Liverpool, requesting answers to\r\nthe following queries:\r\n\r\n“About the ship Atlanta—when did she leave Europe? Had she on board a\r\nFrenchman named Michel Ardan?”\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterward Barbicane received information too exact to leave\r\nroom for the smallest remaining doubt.\r\n\r\n“The steamer Atlanta from Liverpool put to sea on the 2nd of October,\r\nbound for Tampa Town, having on board a Frenchman borne on the list of\r\npassengers by the name of Michel Ardan.”\r\n\r\nThat very evening he wrote to the house of Breadwill and Co.,\r\nrequesting them to suspend the casting of the projectile until the\r\nreceipt of further orders. On the 10th of October, at nine A.M., the\r\nsemaphores of the Bahama Canal signaled a thick smoke on the horizon.\r\nTwo hours later a large steamer exchanged signals with them. the name\r\nof the Atlanta flew at once over Tampa Town. At four o’clock the\r\nEnglish vessel entered the Bay of Espiritu Santo. At five it crossed\r\nthe passage of Hillisborough Bay at full steam. At six she cast anchor\r\nat Port Tampa. The anchor had scarcely caught the sandy bottom when\r\nfive hundred boats surrounded the Atlanta, and the steamer was taken by\r\nassault. Barbicane was the first to set foot on deck, and in a voice of\r\nwhich he vainly tried to conceal the emotion, called “Michel Ardan.”\r\n\r\n“Here!” replied an individual perched on the poop.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, with arms crossed, looked fixedly at the passenger of the\r\nAtlanta.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of about forty-two years of age, of large build, but\r\nslightly round-shouldered. His massive head momentarily shook a shock\r\nof reddish hair, which resembled a lion’s mane. His face was short with\r\na broad forehead, and furnished with a moustache as bristly as a cat’s,\r\nand little patches of yellowish whiskers upon full cheeks. Round,\r\nwildish eyes, slightly near-sighted, completed a physiognomy\r\nessentially feline. His nose was firmly shaped, his mouth particularly\r\nsweet in expression, high forehead, intelligent and furrowed with\r\nwrinkles like a newly-plowed field. The body was powerfully developed\r\nand firmly fixed upon long legs. Muscular arms, and a general air of\r\ndecision gave him the appearance of a hardy, jolly, companion. He was\r\ndressed in a suit of ample dimensions, loose neckerchief, open\r\nshirtcollar, disclosing a robust neck; his cuffs were invariably\r\nunbuttoned, through which appeared a pair of red hands.\r\n\r\nOn the bridge of the steamer, in the midst of the crowd, he bustled to\r\nand fro, never still for a moment, “dragging his anchors,” as the\r\nsailors say, gesticulating, making free with everybody, biting his\r\nnails with nervous avidity. He was one of those originals which nature\r\nsometimes invents in the freak of a moment, and of which she then\r\nbreaks the mould.\r\n\r\nAmong other peculiarities, this curiosity gave himself out for a\r\nsublime ignoramus, “like Shakespeare,” and professed supreme contempt\r\nfor all scientific men. Those “fellows,” as he called them, “are only\r\nfit to mark the points, while we play the game.” He was, in fact, a\r\nthorough Bohemian, adventurous, but not an adventurer; a hare-brained\r\nfellow, a kind of Icarus, only possessing relays of wings. For the\r\nrest, he was ever in scrapes, ending invariably by falling on his feet,\r\nlike those little figures which they sell for children’s toys. In a few\r\nwords, his motto was “I have my opinions,” and the love of the\r\nimpossible constituted his ruling passion.\r\n\r\nSuch was the passenger of the Atlanta, always excitable, as if boiling\r\nunder the action of some internal fire by the character of his physical\r\norganization. If ever two individuals offered a striking contrast to\r\neach other, these were certainly Michel Ardan and the Yankee Barbicane;\r\nboth, moreover, being equally enterprising and daring, each in his own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe scrutiny which the president of the Gun Club had instituted\r\nregarding this new rival was quickly interrupted by the shouts and\r\nhurrahs of the crowd. The cries became at last so uproarious, and the\r\npopular enthusiasm assumed so personal a form, that Michel Ardan, after\r\nhaving shaken hands some thousands of times, at the imminent risk of\r\nleaving his fingers behind him, was fain at last to make a bolt for his\r\ncabin.\r\n\r\nBarbicane followed him without uttering a word.\r\n\r\n“You are Barbicane, I suppose?” said Michel Ardan, in a tone of voice\r\nin which he would have addressed a friend of twenty years’ standing.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the president of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\n“All right! how d’ye do, Barbicane? how are you getting on—pretty well?\r\nthat’s right.”\r\n\r\n“So,” said Barbicane without further preliminary, “you are quite\r\ndetermined to go.”\r\n\r\n“Quite decided.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing will stop you?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. Have you modified your projectile according to my telegram.”\r\n\r\n“I waited for your arrival. But,” asked Barbicane again, “have you\r\ncarefully reflected?”\r\n\r\n“Reflected? have I any time to spare? I find an opportunity of making a\r\ntour in the moon, and I mean to profit by it. There is the whole gist\r\nof the matter.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane looked hard at this man who spoke so lightly of his project\r\nwith such complete absence of anxiety. “But, at least,” said he, “you\r\nhave some plans, some means of carrying your project into execution?”\r\n\r\n“Excellent, my dear Barbicane; only permit me to offer one remark: My\r\nwish is to tell my story once for all, to everybody, and then have done\r\nwith it; then there will be no need for recapitulation. So, if you have\r\nno objection, assemble your friends, colleagues, the whole town, all\r\nFlorida, all America if you like, and to-morrow I shall be ready to\r\nexplain my plans and answer any objections whatever that may be\r\nadvanced. You may rest assured I shall wait without stirring. Will that\r\nsuit you?”\r\n\r\n“All right,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\nSo saying, the president left the cabin and informed the crowd of the\r\nproposal of Michel Ardan. His words were received with clappings of\r\nhands and shouts of joy. They had removed all difficulties. To-morrow\r\nevery one would contemplate at his ease this European hero. However,\r\nsome of the spectators, more infatuated than the rest, would not leave\r\nthe deck of the Atlanta. They passed the night on board. Among others\r\nJ. T. Maston got his hook fixed in the combing of the poop, and it\r\npretty nearly required the capstan to get it out again.\r\n\r\n“He is a hero! a hero!” he cried, a theme of which he was never tired\r\nof ringing the changes; “and we are only like weak, silly women,\r\ncompared with this European!”\r\n\r\nAs to the president, after having suggested to the visitors it was time\r\nto retire, he re-entered the passenger’s cabin, and remained there till\r\nthe bell of the steamer made it midnight.\r\n\r\nBut then the two rivals in popularity shook hands heartily and parted\r\non terms of intimate friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nA MONSTER MEETING\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the following day Barbicane, fearing that indiscreet questions might\r\nbe put to Michel Ardan, was desirous of reducing the number of the\r\naudience to a few of the initiated, his own colleagues for instance. He\r\nmight as well have tried to check the Falls of Niagara! he was\r\ncompelled, therefore, to give up the idea, and let his new friend run\r\nthe chances of a public conference. The place chosen for this monster\r\nmeeting was a vast plain situated in the rear of the town. In a few\r\nhours, thanks to the help of the shipping in port, an immense roofing\r\nof canvas was stretched over the parched prairie, and protected it from\r\nthe burning rays of the sun. There three hundred thousand people braved\r\nfor many hours the stifling heat while awaiting the arrival of the\r\nFrenchman. Of this crowd of spectators a first set could both see and\r\nhear; a second set saw badly and heard nothing at all; and as for the\r\nthird, it could neither see nor hear anything at all. At three o’clock\r\nMichel Ardan made his appearance, accompanied by the principal members\r\nof the Gun Club. He was supported on his right by President Barbicane,\r\nand on his left by J. T. Maston, more radiant than the midday sun, and\r\nnearly as ruddy. Ardan mounted a platform, from the top of which his\r\nview extended over a sea of black hats.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited not the slightest embarrassment; he was just as gay,\r\nfamiliar, and pleasant as if he were at home. To the hurrahs which\r\ngreeted him he replied by a graceful bow; then, waving his hands to\r\nrequest silence, he spoke in perfectly correct English as follows:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, despite the very hot weather I request your patience for a\r\nshort time while I offer some explanations regarding the projects which\r\nseem to have so interested you. I am neither an orator nor a man of\r\nscience, and I had no idea of addressing you in public; but my friend\r\nBarbicane has told me that you would like to hear me, and I am quite at\r\nyour service. Listen to me, therefore, with your six hundred thousand\r\nears, and please excuse the faults of the speaker. Now pray do not\r\nforget that you see before you a perfect ignoramus whose ignorance goes\r\nso far that he cannot even understand the difficulties! It seemed to\r\nhim that it was a matter quite simple, natural, and easy to take one’s\r\nplace in a projectile and start for the moon! That journey must be\r\nundertaken sooner or later; and, as for the mode of locomotion adopted,\r\nit follows simply the law of progress. Man began by walking on\r\nall-fours; then, one fine day, on two feet; then in a carriage; then in\r\na stage-coach; and lastly by railway. Well, the projectile is the\r\nvehicle of the future, and the planets themselves are nothing else! Now\r\nsome of you, gentlemen, may imagine that the velocity we propose to\r\nimpart to it is extravagant. It is nothing of the kind. All the stars\r\nexceed it in rapidity, and the earth herself is at this moment carrying\r\nus round the sun at three times as rapid a rate, and yet she is a mere\r\nlounger on the way compared with many others of the planets! And her\r\nvelocity is constantly decreasing. Is it not evident, then, I ask you,\r\nthat there will some day appear velocities far greater than these, of\r\nwhich light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent?\r\n\r\n“Yes, gentlemen,” continued the orator, “in spite of the opinions of\r\ncertain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon\r\nthis globe, as within some magic circle which it must never outstep, we\r\nshall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the\r\nsame facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from\r\nLiverpool to New York! Distance is but a relative expression, and must\r\nend by being reduced to zero.”\r\n\r\nThe assembly, strongly predisposed as they were in favor of the French\r\nhero, were slightly staggered at this bold theory. Michel Ardan\r\nperceived the fact.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he continued with a pleasant smile, “you do not seem quite\r\nconvinced. Very good! Let us reason the matter out. Do you know how\r\nlong it would take for an express train to reach the moon? Three\r\nhundred days; no more! And what is that? The distance is no more than\r\nnine times the circumference of the earth; and there are no sailors or\r\ntravelers, of even moderate activity, who have not made longer journeys\r\nthan that in their lifetime. And now consider that I shall be only\r\nninety- seven hours on my journey. Ah! I see you are reckoning that the\r\nmoon is a long way off from the earth, and that one must think twice\r\nbefore making the experiment. What would you say, then, if we were\r\ntalking of going to Neptune, which revolves at a distance of more than\r\ntwo thousand seven hundred and twenty millions of miles from the sun!\r\nAnd yet what is that compared with the distance of the fixed stars,\r\nsome of which, such as Arcturus, are billions of miles distant from us?\r\nAnd then you talk of the distance which separates the planets from the\r\nsun! And there are people who affirm that such a thing as distance\r\nexists. Absurdity, folly, idiotic nonsense! Would you know what I think\r\nof our own solar universe? Shall I tell you my theory? It is very\r\nsimple! In my opinion the solar system is a solid homogeneous body; the\r\nplanets which compose it are in actual contact with each other; and\r\nwhatever space exists between them is nothing more than the space which\r\nseparates the molecules of the densest metal, such as silver, iron, or\r\nplatinum! I have the right, therefore, to affirm, and I repeat, with\r\nthe conviction which must penetrate all your minds, ‘Distance is but an\r\nempty name; distance does not really exist!’”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” cried one voice (need it be said it was that of J. T.\r\nMaston). “Distance does not exist!” And overcome by the energy of his\r\nmovements, he nearly fell from the platform to the ground. He just\r\nescaped a severe fall, which would have proved to him that distance was\r\nby no means an empty name.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” resumed the orator, “I repeat that the distance between\r\nthe earth and her satellite is a mere trifle, and undeserving of\r\nserious consideration. I am convinced that before twenty years are over\r\none-half of our earth will have paid a visit to the moon. Now, my\r\nworthy friends, if you have any question to put to me, you will, I\r\nfear, sadly embarrass a poor man like myself; still I will do my best\r\nto answer you.”\r\n\r\nUp to this point the president of the Gun Club had been satisfied with\r\nthe turn which the discussion had assumed. It became now, however,\r\ndesirable to divert Ardan from questions of a practical nature, with\r\nwhich he was doubtless far less conversant. Barbicane, therefore,\r\nhastened to get in a word, and began by asking his new friend whether\r\nhe thought that the moon and the planets were inhabited.\r\n\r\n“You put before me a great problem, my worthy president,” replied the\r\norator, smiling. “Still, men of great intelligence, such as Plutarch,\r\nSwedenborg, Bernardin de St. Pierre, and others have, if I mistake not,\r\npronounced in the affirmative. Looking at the question from the natural\r\nphilosopher’s point of view, I should say that nothing useless existed\r\nin the world; and, replying to your question by another, I should\r\nventure to assert, that if these worlds are habitable, they either are,\r\nhave been, or will be inhabited.”\r\n\r\n“No one could answer more logically or fairly,” replied the president.\r\n“The question then reverts to this: Are these worlds habitable? For my\r\nown part I believe they are.”\r\n\r\n“For myself, I feel certain of it,” said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless,” retorted one of the audience, “there are many arguments\r\nagainst the habitability of the worlds. The conditions of life must\r\nevidently be greatly modified upon the majority of them. To mention\r\nonly the planets, we should be either broiled alive in some, or frozen\r\nto death in others, according as they are more or less removed from the\r\nsun.”\r\n\r\n“I regret,” replied Michel Ardan, “that I have not the honor of\r\npersonally knowing my contradictor, for I would have attempted to\r\nanswer him. His objection has its merits, I admit; but I think we may\r\nsuccessfully combat it, as well as all others which affect the\r\nhabitability of other worlds. If I were a natural philosopher, I would\r\ntell him that if less of caloric were set in motion upon the planets\r\nwhich are nearest to the sun, and more, on the contrary, upon those\r\nwhich are farthest removed from it, this simple fact would alone\r\nsuffice to equalize the heat, and to render the temperature of those\r\nworlds supportable by beings organized like ourselves. If I were a\r\nnaturalist, I would tell him that, according to some illustrious men of\r\nscience, nature has furnished us with instances upon the earth of\r\nanimals existing under very varying conditions of life; that fish\r\nrespire in a medium fatal to other animals; that amphibious creatures\r\npossess a double existence very difficult of explanation; that certain\r\ndenizens of the seas maintain life at enormous depths, and there\r\nsupport a pressure equal to that of fifty or sixty atmospheres without\r\nbeing crushed; that several aquatic insects, insensible to temperature,\r\nare met with equally among boiling springs and in the frozen plains of\r\nthe Polar Sea; in fine, that we cannot help recognizing in nature a\r\ndiversity of means of operation oftentimes incomprehensible, but not\r\nthe less real. If I were a chemist, I would tell him that the\r\naerolites, bodies evidently formed exteriorly of our terrestrial globe,\r\nhave, upon analysis, revealed indisputable traces of carbon, a\r\nsubstance which owes its origin solely to organized beings, and which,\r\naccording to the experiments of Reichenbach, must necessarily itself\r\nhave been endued with animation. And lastly, were I a theologian, I\r\nwould tell him that the scheme of the Divine Redemption, according to\r\nSt. Paul, seems to be applicable, not merely to the earth, but to all\r\nthe celestial worlds. But, unfortunately, I am neither theologian, nor\r\nchemist, nor naturalist, nor philosopher; therefore, in my absolute\r\nignorance of the great laws which govern the universe, I confine myself\r\nto saying in reply, ‘I do not know whether the worlds are inhabited or\r\nnot: and since I do not know, I am going to see!’”\r\n\r\nWhether Michel Ardan’s antagonist hazarded any further arguments or not\r\nit is impossible to say, for the uproarious shouts of the crowd would\r\nnot allow any expression of opinion to gain a hearing. On silence being\r\nrestored, the triumphant orator contented himself with adding the\r\nfollowing remarks:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, you will observe that I have but slightly touched upon this\r\ngreat question. There is another altogether different line of argument\r\nin favor of the habitability of the stars, which I omit for the\r\npresent. I only desire to call attention to one point. To those who\r\nmaintain that the planets are _not_ inhabited one may reply: You might\r\nbe perfectly in the right, if you could only show that the earth is the\r\nbest possible world, in spite of what Voltaire has said. She has but\r\n_one_ satellite, while Jupiter, Uranus, Saturn, Neptune have each\r\nseveral, an advantage by no means to be despised. But that which\r\nrenders our own globe so uncomfortable is the inclination of its axis\r\nto the plane of its orbit. Hence the inequality of days and nights;\r\nhence the disagreeable diversity of the seasons. On the surface of our\r\nunhappy spheroid we are always either too hot or too cold; we are\r\nfrozen in winter, broiled in summer; it is the planet of rheumatism,\r\ncoughs, bronchitis; while on the surface of Jupiter, for example, where\r\nthe axis is but slightly inclined, the inhabitants may enjoy uniform\r\ntemperatures. It possesses zones of perpetual springs, summers,\r\nautumns, and winters; every Jovian may choose for himself what climate\r\nhe likes, and there spend the whole of his life in security from all\r\nvariations of temperature. You will, I am sure, readily admit this\r\nsuperiority of Jupiter over our own planet, to say nothing of his\r\nyears, which each equal twelve of ours! Under such auspices and such\r\nmarvelous conditions of existence, it appears to me that the\r\ninhabitants of so fortunate a world must be in every respect superior\r\nto ourselves. All we require, in order to attain such perfection, is\r\nthe mere trifle of having an axis of rotation less inclined to the\r\nplane of its orbit!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” roared an energetic voice, “let us unite our efforts, invent\r\nthe necessary machines, and rectify the earth’s axis!”\r\n\r\nA thunder of applause followed this proposal, the author of which was,\r\nof course, no other than J. T. Maston. And, in all probability, if the\r\ntruth must be told, if the Yankees could only have found a point of\r\napplication for it, they would have constructed a lever capable of\r\nraising the earth and rectifying its axis. It was just this deficiency\r\nwhich baffled these daring mechanicians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nATTACK AND RIPOSTE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the excitement had subsided, the following words were heard\r\nuttered in a strong and determined voice:\r\n\r\n“Now that the speaker has favored us with so much imagination, would he\r\nbe so good as to return to his subject, and give us a little practical\r\nview of the question?”\r\n\r\nAll eyes were directed toward the person who spoke. He was a little\r\ndried-up man, of an active figure, with an American “goatee” beard.\r\nProfiting by the different movements in the crowd, he had managed by\r\ndegrees to gain the front row of spectators. There, with arms crossed\r\nand stern gaze, he watched the hero of the meeting. After having put\r\nhis question he remained silent, and appeared to take no notice of the\r\nthousands of looks directed toward himself, nor of the murmur of\r\ndisapprobation excited by his words. Meeting at first with no reply, he\r\nrepeated his question with marked emphasis, adding, “We are here to\r\ntalk about the _moon_ and not about the _earth_.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, sir,” replied Michel Ardan; “the discussion has become\r\nirregular. We will return to the moon.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the unknown, “you pretend that our satellite is inhabited.\r\nVery good, but if Selenites do exist, that race of beings assuredly\r\nmust live without breathing, for—I warn you for your own sake—there is\r\nnot the smallest particle of air on the surface of the moon.”\r\n\r\nAt this remark Ardan pushed up his shock of red hair; he saw that he\r\nwas on the point of being involved in a struggle with this person upon\r\nthe very gist of the whole question. He looked sternly at him in his\r\nturn and said:\r\n\r\n“Oh! so there is no air in the moon? And pray, if you are so good, who\r\nventures to affirm that?\r\n\r\n“The men of science.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Really.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Michel, “pleasantry apart, I have a profound respect for\r\nmen of science who do possess science, but a profound contempt for men\r\nof science who do not.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know any who belong to the latter category?”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly. In France there are some who maintain that, mathematically,\r\na bird cannot possibly fly; and others who demonstrate theoretically\r\nthat fishes were never made to live in water.”\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to do with persons of that description, and I can\r\nquote, in support of my statement, names which you cannot refuse\r\ndeference to.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sir, you will sadly embarrass a poor ignorant, who, besides,\r\nasks nothing better than to learn.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then, do you introduce scientific questions if you have never\r\nstudied them?” asked the unknown somewhat coarsely.\r\n\r\n“For the reason that ‘he is always brave who never suspects danger.’ I\r\nknow nothing, it is true; but it is precisely my very weakness which\r\nconstitutes my strength.”\r\n\r\n“Your weakness amounts to folly,” retorted the unknown in a passion.\r\n\r\n“All the better,” replied our Frenchman, “if it carries me up to the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his colleagues devoured with their eyes the intruder who\r\nhad so boldly placed himself in antagonism to their enterprise. Nobody\r\nknew him, and the president, uneasy as to the result of so free a\r\ndiscussion, watched his new friend with some anxiety. The meeting began\r\nto be somewhat fidgety also, for the contest directed their attention\r\nto the dangers, if not the actual impossibilities, of the proposed\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Ardan’s antagonist, “there are many and incontrovertible\r\nreasons which prove the absence of an atmosphere in the moon. I might\r\nsay that, _a priori_, if one ever did exist, it must have been absorbed\r\nby the earth; but I prefer to bring forward indisputable facts.”\r\n\r\n“Bring them forward then, sir, as many as you please.”\r\n\r\n“You know,” said the stranger, “that when any luminous rays cross a\r\nmedium such as the air, they are deflected out of the straight line; in\r\nother words, they undergo refraction. Well! When stars are occulted by\r\nthe moon, their rays, on grazing the edge of her disc, exhibit not the\r\nleast deviation, nor offer the slightest indication of refraction. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that the moon cannot be surrounded by an\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n“In point of fact,” replied Ardan, “this is your chief, if not your\r\n_only_ argument; and a really scientific man might be puzzled to answer\r\nit. For myself, I will simply say that it is defective, because it\r\nassumes that the angular diameter of the moon has been completely\r\ndetermined, which is not the case. But let us proceed. Tell me, my dear\r\nsir, do you admit the existence of volcanoes on the moon’s surface?”\r\n\r\n“Extinct, yes! In activity, no!”\r\n\r\n“These volcanoes, however, were at one time in a state of activity?”\r\n\r\n“True, but, as they furnish themselves the oxygen necessary for\r\ncombustion, the mere fact of their eruption does not prove the presence\r\nof an atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed again, then; and let us set aside this class of arguments in\r\norder to come to direct observations. In 1715 the astronomers Louville\r\nand Halley, watching the eclipse of the 3rd of May, remarked some very\r\nextraordinary scintillations. These jets of light, rapid in nature, and\r\nof frequent recurrence, they attributed to thunderstorms generated in\r\nthe lunar atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“In 1715,” replied the unknown, “the astronomers Louville and Halley\r\nmistook for lunar phenomena some which were purely terrestrial, such as\r\nmeteoric or other bodies which are generated in our own atmosphere.\r\nThis was the scientific explanation at the time of the facts; and that\r\nis my answer now.”\r\n\r\n“On again, then,” replied Ardan; “Herschel, in 1787, observed a great\r\nnumber of luminous points on the moon’s surface, did he not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! but without offering any solution of them. Herschel himself never\r\ninferred from them the necessity of a lunar atmosphere. And I may add\r\nthat Baeer and Maedler, the two great authorities upon the moon, are\r\nquite agreed as to the entire absence of air on its surface.”\r\n\r\nA movement was here manifest among the assemblage, who appeared to be\r\ngrowing excited by the arguments of this singular personage.\r\n\r\n“Let us proceed,” replied Ardan, with perfect coolness, “and come to\r\none important fact. A skillful French astronomer, M. Laussedat, in\r\nwatching the eclipse of July 18, 1860, probed that the horns of the\r\nlunar crescent were rounded and truncated. Now, this appearance could\r\nonly have been produced by a deviation of the solar rays in traversing\r\nthe atmosphere of the moon. There is no other possible explanation of\r\nthe facts.”\r\n\r\n“But is this established as a fact?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely certain!”\r\n\r\nA counter-movement here took place in favor of the hero of the meeting,\r\nwhose opponent was now reduced to silence. Ardan resumed the\r\nconversation; and without exhibiting any exultation at the advantage he\r\nhad gained, simply said:\r\n\r\n“You see, then, my dear sir, we must not pronounce with absolute\r\npositiveness against the existence of an atmosphere in the moon. That\r\natmosphere is, probably, of extreme rarity; nevertheless at the present\r\nday science generally admits that it exists.”\r\n\r\n“Not in the mountains, at all events,” returned the unknown, unwilling\r\nto give in.\r\n\r\n“No! but at the bottom of the valleys, and not exceeding a few hundred\r\nfeet in height.”\r\n\r\n“In any case you will do well to take every precaution, for the air\r\nwill be terribly rarified.”\r\n\r\n“My good sir, there will always be enough for a solitary individual;\r\nbesides, once arrived up there, I shall do my best to economize, and\r\nnot to breathe except on grand occasions!”\r\n\r\nA tremendous roar of laughter rang in the ears of the mysterious\r\ninterlocutor, who glared fiercely round upon the assembly.\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Ardan, with a careless air, “since we are in accord\r\nregarding the presence of a certain atmosphere, we are forced to admit\r\nthe presence of a certain quantity of water. This is a happy\r\nconsequence for me. Moreover, my amiable contradictor, permit me to\r\nsubmit to you one further observation. We only know _one_ side of the\r\nmoon’s disc; and if there is but little air on the face presented to\r\nus, it is possible that there is plenty on the one turned away from\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“And for what reason?”\r\n\r\n“Because the moon, under the action of the earth’s attraction, has\r\nassumed the form of an egg, which we look at from the smaller end.\r\nHence it follows, by Hausen’s calculations, that its center of gravity\r\nis situated in the other hemisphere. Hence it results that the great\r\nmass of air and water must have been drawn away to the other face of\r\nour satellite during the first days of its creation.”\r\n\r\n“Pure fancies!” cried the unknown.\r\n\r\n“No! Pure theories! which are based upon the laws of mechanics, and it\r\nseems difficult to me to refute them. I appeal then to this meeting,\r\nand I put it to them whether life, such as exists upon the earth, is\r\npossible on the surface of the moon?”\r\n\r\nThree hundred thousand auditors at once applauded the proposition.\r\nArdan’s opponent tried to get in another word, but he could not obtain\r\na hearing. Cries and menaces fell upon him like hail.\r\n\r\n“Enough! enough!” cried some.\r\n\r\n“Drive the intruder off!” shouted others.\r\n\r\n“Turn him out!” roared the exasperated crowd.\r\n\r\nBut he, holding firmly on to the platform, did not budge an inch, and\r\nlet the storm pass on, which would soon have assumed formidable\r\nproportions, if Michel Ardan had not quieted it by a gesture. He was\r\ntoo chivalrous to abandon his opponent in an apparent extremity.\r\n\r\n“You wished to say a few more words?” he asked, in a pleasant voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a thousand; or rather, no, only one! If you persevere in your\r\nenterprise, you must be a—”\r\n\r\n“Very rash person! How can you treat me as such? me, who have demanded\r\na cylindro-conical projectile, in order to prevent turning round and\r\nround on my way like a squirrel?”\r\n\r\n“But, unhappy man, the dreadful recoil will smash you to pieces at your\r\nstarting.”\r\n\r\n“My dear contradictor, you have just put your finger upon the true and\r\nonly difficulty; nevertheless, I have too good an opinion of the\r\nindustrial genius of the Americans not to believe that they will\r\nsucceed in overcoming it.”\r\n\r\n“But the heat developed by the rapidity of the projectile in crossing\r\nthe strata of air?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! the walls are thick, and I shall soon have crossed the\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“But victuals and water?”\r\n\r\n“I have calculated for a twelvemonth’s supply, and I shall be only four\r\ndays on the journey.”\r\n\r\n“But for air to breathe on the road?”\r\n\r\n“I shall make it by a chemical process.”\r\n\r\n“But your fall on the moon, supposing you ever reach it?”\r\n\r\n“It will be six times less dangerous than a sudden fall upon the earth,\r\nbecause the weight will be only one-sixth as great on the surface of\r\nthe moon.”\r\n\r\n“Still it will be enough to smash you like glass!”\r\n\r\n“What is to prevent my retarding the shock by means of rockets\r\nconveniently placed, and lighted at the right moment?”\r\n\r\n“But after all, supposing all difficulties surmounted, all obstacles\r\nremoved, supposing everything combined to favor you, and granting that\r\nyou may arrive safe and sound in the moon, how will you come back?”\r\n\r\n“I am not coming back!”\r\n\r\nAt this reply, almost sublime in its very simplicity, the assembly\r\nbecame silent. But its silence was more eloquent than could have been\r\nits cries of enthusiasm. The unknown profited by the opportunity and\r\nonce more protested:\r\n\r\n“You will inevitably kill yourself!” he cried; “and your death will be\r\nthat of a madman, useless even to science!”\r\n\r\n“Go on, my dear unknown, for truly your prophecies are most agreeable!”\r\n\r\n“It really is too much!” cried Michel Ardan’s adversary. “I do not know\r\nwhy I should continue so frivolous a discussion! Please yourself about\r\nthis insane expedition! We need not trouble ourselves about you!”\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t stand upon ceremony!”\r\n\r\n“No! another person is responsible for your act.”\r\n\r\n“Who, may I ask?” demanded Michel Ardan in an imperious tone.\r\n\r\n“The ignoramus who organized this equally absurd and impossible\r\nexperiment!”\r\n\r\nThe attack was direct. Barbicane, ever since the interference of the\r\nunknown, had been making fearful efforts of self-control; now, however,\r\nseeing himself directly attacked, he could restrain himself no longer.\r\nHe rose suddenly, and was rushing upon the enemy who thus braved him to\r\nthe face, when all at once he found himself separated from him.\r\n\r\nThe platform was lifted by a hundred strong arms, and the president of\r\nthe Gun Club shared with Michel Ardan triumphal honors. The shield was\r\nheavy, but the bearers came in continuous relays, disputing,\r\nstruggling, even fighting among themselves in their eagerness to lend\r\ntheir shoulders to this demonstration.\r\n\r\nHowever, the unknown had not profited by the tumult to quit his post.\r\nBesides he could not have done it in the midst of that compact crowd.\r\nThere he held on in the front row with crossed arms, glaring at\r\nPresident Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the immense crowd continued at their highest pitch\r\nthroughout this triumphant march. Michel Ardan took it all with evident\r\npleasure. His face gleamed with delight. Several times the platform\r\nseemed seized with pitching and rolling like a weatherbeaten ship. But\r\nthe two heros of the meeting had good sea-legs. They never stumbled;\r\nand their vessel arrived without dues at the port of Tampa Town.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan managed fortunately to escape from the last embraces of\r\nhis vigorous admirers. He made for the Hotel Franklin, quickly gained\r\nhis chamber, and slid under the bedclothes, while an army of a hundred\r\nthousand men kept watch under his windows.\r\n\r\nDuring this time a scene, short, grave, and decisive, took place\r\nbetween the mysterious personage and the president of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, free at last, had gone straight at his adversary.\r\n\r\n“Come!” he said shortly.\r\n\r\nThe other followed him on the quay; and the two presently found\r\nthemselves alone at the entrance of an open wharf on Jones’ Fall.\r\n\r\nThe two enemies, still mutually unknown, gazed at each other.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Captain Nicholl!”\r\n\r\n“So I suspected. Hitherto chance has never thrown you in my way.”\r\n\r\n“I am come for that purpose.”\r\n\r\n“You have insulted me.”\r\n\r\n“Publicly!”\r\n\r\n“And you will answer to me for this insult?”\r\n\r\n“At this very moment.”\r\n\r\n“No! I desire that all that passes between us shall be secret. Their is\r\na wood situated three miles from Tampa, the wood of Skersnaw. Do you\r\nknow it?”\r\n\r\n“I know it.”\r\n\r\n“Will you be so good as to enter it to-morrow morning at five o’clock,\r\non one side?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! if you will enter at the other side at the same hour.”\r\n\r\n“And you will not forget your rifle?” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“No more than you will forget yours?” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\nThese words having been coldly spoken, the president of the Gun Club\r\nand the captain parted. Barbicane returned to his lodging; but instead\r\nof snatching a few hours of repose, he passed the night in endeavoring\r\nto discover a means of evading the recoil of the projectile, and\r\nresolving the difficult problem proposed by Michel Ardan during the\r\ndiscussion at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nHOW A FRENCHMAN MANAGES AN AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the contract of this duel was being discussed by the president\r\nand the captain—this dreadful, savage duel, in which each adversary\r\nbecame a man-hunter—Michel Ardan was resting from the fatigues of his\r\ntriumph. Resting is hardly an appropriate expression, for American beds\r\nrival marble or granite tables for hardness.\r\n\r\nArdan was sleeping, then, badly enough, tossing about between the\r\ncloths which served him for sheets, and he was dreaming of making a\r\nmore comfortable couch in his projectile when a frightful noise\r\ndisturbed his dreams. Thundering blows shook his door. They seemed to\r\nbe caused by some iron instrument. A great deal of loud talking was\r\ndistinguishable in this racket, which was rather too early in the\r\nmorning. “Open the door,” some one shrieked, “for heaven’s sake!” Ardan\r\nsaw no reason for complying with a demand so roughly expressed.\r\nHowever, he got up and opened the door just as it was giving way before\r\nthe blows of this determined visitor. The secretary of the Gun Club\r\nburst into the room. A bomb could not have made more noise or have\r\nentered the room with less ceremony.\r\n\r\n“Last night,” cried J. T. Maston, _ex abrupto_, “our president was\r\npublicly insulted during the meeting. He provoked his adversary, who is\r\nnone other than Captain Nicholl! They are fighting this morning in the\r\nwood of Skersnaw. I heard all the particulars from the mouth of\r\nBarbicane himself. If he is killed, then our scheme is at an end. We\r\nmust prevent his duel; and one man alone has enough influence over\r\nBarbicane to stop him, and that man is Michel Ardan.”\r\n\r\nWhile J. T. Maston was speaking, Michel Ardan, without interrupting\r\nhim, had hastily put on his clothes; and, in less than two minutes, the\r\ntwo friends were making for the suburbs of Tampa Town with rapid\r\nstrides.\r\n\r\nIt was during this walk that Maston told Ardan the state of the case.\r\nHe told him the real causes of the hostility between Barbicane and\r\nNicholl; how it was of old date, and why, thanks to unknown friends,\r\nthe president and the captain had, as yet, never met face to face. He\r\nadded that it arose simply from a rivalry between iron plates and shot,\r\nand, finally, that the scene at the meeting was only the\r\nlong-wished-for opportunity for Nicholl to pay off an old grudge.\r\n\r\nNothing is more dreadful than private duels in America. The two\r\nadversaries attack each other like wild beasts. Then it is that they\r\nmight well covet those wonderful properties of the Indians of the\r\nprairies—their quick intelligence, their ingenious cunning, their scent\r\nof the enemy. A single mistake, a moment’s hesitation, a single false\r\nstep may cause death. On these occasions Yankees are often accompanied\r\nby their dogs, and keep up the struggle for hours.\r\n\r\n“What demons you are!” cried Michel Ardan, when his companion had\r\ndepicted this scene to him with much energy.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we are,” replied J. T. modestly; “but we had better make haste.”\r\n\r\nThough Michel Ardan and he had crossed the plains still wet with dew,\r\nand had taken the shortest route over creeks and ricefields, they could\r\nnot reach Skersnaw in under five hours and a half.\r\n\r\nBarbicane must have passed the border half an hour ago.\r\n\r\nThere was an old bushman working there, occupied in selling fagots from\r\ntrees that had been leveled by his axe.\r\n\r\nMaston ran toward him, saying, “Have you seen a man go into the wood,\r\narmed with a rifle? Barbicane, the president, my best friend?”\r\n\r\nThe worthy secretary of the Gun Club thought that his president must be\r\nknown by all the world. But the bushman did not seem to understand him.\r\n\r\n“A hunter?” said Ardan.\r\n\r\n“A hunter? Yes,” replied the bushman.\r\n\r\n“Long ago?”\r\n\r\n“About an hour.”\r\n\r\n“Too late!” cried Maston.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard any gunshots?” asked Ardan.\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“Not one?”\r\n\r\n“Not one! that hunter did not look as if he knew how to hunt!”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done?” said Maston.\r\n\r\n“We must go into the wood, at the risk of getting a ball which is not\r\nintended for us.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Maston, in a tone which could not be mistaken, “I would\r\nrather have twenty balls in my own head than one in Barbicane’s.”\r\n\r\n“Forward, then,” said Ardan, pressing his companion’s hand.\r\n\r\nA few moments later the two friends had disappeared in the copse. It\r\nwas a dense thicket, in which rose huge cypresses, sycamores,\r\ntulip-trees, olives, tamarinds, oaks, and magnolias. These different\r\ntrees had interwoven their branches into an inextricable maze, through\r\nwhich the eye could not penetrate. Michel Ardan and Maston walked side\r\nby side in silence through the tall grass, cutting themselves a path\r\nthrough the strong creepers, casting curious glances on the bushes, and\r\nmomentarily expecting to hear the sound of rifles. As for the traces\r\nwhich Barbicane ought to have left of his passage through the wood,\r\nthere was not a vestige of them visible: so they followed the barely\r\nperceptible paths along which Indians had tracked some enemy, and which\r\nthe dense foliage darkly overshadowed.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour spent in vain pursuit the two stopped in intensified\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n“It must be all over,” said Maston, discouraged. “A man like Barbicane\r\nwould not dodge with his enemy, or ensnare him, would not even\r\nmaneuver! He is too open, too brave. He has gone straight ahead, right\r\ninto the danger, and doubtless far enough from the bushman for the wind\r\nto prevent his hearing the report of the rifles.”\r\n\r\n“But surely,” replied Michel Ardan, “since we entered the wood we\r\nshould have heard!”\r\n\r\n“And what if we came too late?” cried Maston in tones of despair.\r\n\r\nFor once Ardan had no reply to make, he and Maston resuming their walk\r\nin silence. From time to time, indeed, they raised great shouts,\r\ncalling alternately Barbicane and Nicholl, neither of whom, however,\r\nanswered their cries. Only the birds, awakened by the sound, flew past\r\nthem and disappeared among the branches, while some frightened deer\r\nfled precipitately before them.\r\n\r\nFor another hour their search was continued. The greater part of the\r\nwood had been explored. There was nothing to reveal the presence of the\r\ncombatants. The information of the bushman was after all doubtful, and\r\nArdan was about to propose their abandoning this useless pursuit, when\r\nall at once Maston stopped.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said he, “there is some one down there!”\r\n\r\n“Some one?” repeated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Yes; a man! He seems motionless. His rifle is not in his hands. What\r\ncan he be doing?”\r\n\r\n“But can you recognize him?” asked Ardan, whose short sight was of\r\nlittle use to him in such circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Yes! yes! He is turning toward us,” answered Maston.\r\n\r\n“And it is?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Nicholl!”\r\n\r\n“Nicholl?” cried Michel Ardan, feeling a terrible pang of grief.\r\n\r\n“Nicholl unarmed! He has, then, no longer any fear of his adversary!”\r\n\r\n“Let us go to him,” said Michel Ardan, “and find out the truth.”\r\n\r\nBut he and his companion had barely taken fifty steps, when they paused\r\nto examine the captain more attentively. They expected to find a\r\nbloodthirsty man, happy in his revenge.\r\n\r\nOn seeing him, they remained stupefied.\r\n\r\nA net, composed of very fine meshes, hung between two enormous\r\ntulip-trees, and in the midst of this snare, with its wings entangled,\r\nwas a poor little bird, uttering pitiful cries, while it vainly\r\nstruggled to escape. The bird-catcher who had laid this snare was no\r\nhuman being, but a venomous spider, peculiar to that country, as large\r\nas a pigeon’s egg, and armed with enormous claws. The hideous creature,\r\ninstead of rushing on its prey, had beaten a sudden retreat and taken\r\nrefuge in the upper branches of the tulip-tree, for a formidable enemy\r\nmenaced its stronghold.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was Nicholl, his gun on the ground, forgetful of danger,\r\ntrying if possible to save the victim from its cobweb prison. At last\r\nit was accomplished, and the little bird flew joyfully away and\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nNicholl lovingly watched its flight, when he heard these words\r\npronounced by a voice full of emotion:\r\n\r\n“You are indeed a brave man.”\r\n\r\nHe turned. Michel Ardan was before him, repeating in a different tone:\r\n\r\n“And a kindhearted one!”\r\n\r\n“Michel Ardan!” cried the captain. “Why are you here?”\r\n\r\n“To press your hand, Nicholl, and to prevent you from either killing\r\nBarbicane or being killed by him.”\r\n\r\n“Barbicane!” returned the captain. “I have been looking for him for the\r\nlast two hours in vain. Where is he hiding?”\r\n\r\n“Nicholl!” said Michel Ardan, “this is not courteous! we ought always\r\nto treat an adversary with respect; rest assureed if Barbicane is still\r\nalive we shall find him all the more easily; because if he has not,\r\nlike you, been amusing himself with freeing oppressed birds, he must be\r\nlooking for _you_. When we have found him, Michel Ardan tells you this,\r\nthere will be no duel between you.”\r\n\r\n“Between President Barbicane and myself,” gravely replied Nicholl,\r\n“there is a rivalry which the death of one of us—”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh!” said Ardan. “Brave fellows like you indeed! you shall not\r\nfight!”\r\n\r\n“I will fight, sir!”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said J. T. Maston, with much feeling, “I am a friend of the\r\npresident’s, his _alter ego_, his second self; if you really must kill\r\nsome one, _shoot me!_ it will do just as well!”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” Nicholl replied, seizing his rifle convulsively, “these jokes—”\r\n\r\n“Our friend Maston is not joking,” replied Ardan. “I fully understand\r\nhis idea of being killed himself in order to save his friend. But\r\nneither he nor Barbicane will fall before the balls of Captain Nicholl.\r\nIndeed I have so attractive a proposal to make to the two rivals, that\r\nboth will be eager to accept it.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Nicholl with manifest incredulity.\r\n\r\n“Patience!” exclaimed Ardan. “I can only reveal it in the presence of\r\nBarbicane.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go in search of him then!” cried the captain.\r\n\r\nThe three men started off at once; the captain having discharged his\r\nrifle threw it over his shoulder, and advanced in silence. Another half\r\nhour passed, and the pursuit was still fruitless. Maston was oppressed\r\nby sinister forebodings. He looked fiercely at Nicholl, asking himself\r\nwhether the captain’s vengeance had already been satisfied, and the\r\nunfortunate Barbicane, shot, was perhaps lying dead on some bloody\r\ntrack. The same thought seemed to occur to Ardan; and both were casting\r\ninquiring glances on Nicholl, when suddenly Maston paused.\r\n\r\nThe motionless figure of a man leaning against a gigantic catalpa\r\ntwenty feet off appeared, half-veiled by the foliage.\r\n\r\n“It is he!” said Maston.\r\n\r\nBarbicane never moved. Ardan looked at the captain, but he did not\r\nwince. Ardan went forward crying:\r\n\r\n“Barbicane! Barbicane!”\r\n\r\nNo answer! Ardan rushed toward his friend; but in the act of seizing\r\nhis arms, he stopped short and uttered a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, pencil in hand, was tracing geometrical figures in a\r\nmemorandum book, while his unloaded rifle lay beside him on the ground.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in his studies, Barbicane, in his turn forgetful of the duel,\r\nhad seen and heard nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Ardan took his hand, he looked up and stared at his visitor in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“Ah, it is you!” he cried at last. “I have found it, my friend, I have\r\nfound it!”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“My plan!”\r\n\r\n“What plan?”\r\n\r\n“The plan for countering the effect of the shock at the departure of\r\nthe projectile!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Michel Ardan, looking at the captain out of the corner\r\nof his eye.\r\n\r\n“Yes! water! simply water, which will act as a spring—ah! Maston,”\r\ncried Barbicane, “you here also?”\r\n\r\n“Himself,” replied Ardan; “and permit me to introduce to you at the\r\nsame time the worthy Captain Nicholl!”\r\n\r\n“Nicholl!” cried Barbicane, who jumped up at once. “Pardon me, captain,\r\nI had quite forgotten—I am ready!”\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan interfered, without giving the two enemies time to say\r\nanything more.\r\n\r\n“Thank heaven!” said he. “It is a happy thing that brave men like you\r\ntwo did not meet sooner! we should now have been mourning for one or\r\nother of you. But, thanks to Providence, which has interfered, there is\r\nnow no further cause for alarm. When one forgets one’s anger in\r\nmechanics or in cobwebs, it is a sign that the anger is not dangerous.”\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan then told the president how the captain had been found\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n“I put it to you now,” said he in conclusion, “are two such good\r\nfellows as you are made on purpose to smash each other’s skulls with\r\nshot?”\r\n\r\nThere was in “the situation” somewhat of the ridiculous, something\r\nquite unexpected; Michel Ardan saw this, and determined to effect a\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\n“My good friends,” said he, with his most bewitching smile, “this is\r\nnothing but a misunderstanding. Nothing more! well! to prove that it is\r\nall over between you, accept frankly the proposal I am going to make to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Make it,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Our friend Barbicane believes that his projectile will go straight to\r\nthe moon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly,” replied the president.\r\n\r\n“And our friend Nicholl is persuaded it will fall back upon the earth?”\r\n\r\n“I am certain of it,” cried the captain.\r\n\r\n“Good!” said Ardan. “I cannot pretend to make you agree; but I suggest\r\nthis: Go with me, and so see whether we are stopped on our journey.”\r\n\r\n“What?” exclaimed J. T. Maston, stupefied.\r\n\r\nThe two rivals, on this sudden proposal, looked steadily at each other.\r\nBarbicane waited for the captain’s answer. Nicholl watched for the\r\ndecision of the president.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Michel. “There is now no fear of the shock!”\r\n\r\n“Done!” cried Barbicane.\r\n\r\nBut quickly as he pronounced the word, he was not before Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! bravo! hip! hip! hurrah!” cried Michel, giving a hand to each\r\nof the late adversaries. “Now that it is all settled, my friends, allow\r\nme to treat you after French fashion. Let us be off to breakfast!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nTHE NEW CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThat same day all America heard of the affair of Captain Nicholl and\r\nPresident Barbicane, as well as its singular _denouement_. From that\r\nday forth, Michel Ardan had not one moment’s rest. Deputations from all\r\ncorners of the Union harassed him without cessation or intermission. He\r\nwas compelled to receive them all, whether he would or no. How many\r\nhands he shook, how many people he was “hail-fellow-well-met” with, it\r\nis impossible to guess! Such a triumphal result would have intoxicated\r\nany other man; but he managed to keep himself in a state of delightful\r\n_semi_-tipsiness.\r\n\r\nAmong the deputations of all kinds which assailed him, that of “The\r\nLunatics” were careful not to forget what they owed to the future\r\nconqueror of the moon. One day, certain of these poor people, so\r\nnumerous in America, came to call upon him, and requested permission to\r\nreturn with him to their native country.\r\n\r\n“Singular hallucination!” said he to Barbicane, after having dismissed\r\nthe deputation with promises to convey numbers of messages to friends\r\nin the moon. “Do you believe in the influence of the moon upon\r\ndistempers?”\r\n\r\n“Scarcely!”\r\n\r\n“No more do I, despite some remarkable recorded facts of history. For\r\ninstance, during an epidemic in 1693, a large number of persons died at\r\nthe very moment of an eclipse. The celebrated Bacon always fainted\r\nduring an eclipse. Charles VI relapsed six times into madness during\r\nthe year 1399, sometimes during the new, sometimes during the full\r\nmoon. Gall observed that insane persons underwent an accession of their\r\ndisorder twice in every month, at the epochs of new and full moon. In\r\nfact, numerous observations made upon fevers, somnambulisms, and other\r\nhuman maladies, seem to prove that the moon does exercise some\r\nmysterious influence upon man.”\r\n\r\n“But the how and the wherefore?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Well, I can only give you the answer which Arago borrowed from\r\nPlutarch, which is nineteen centuries old. ‘Perhaps the stories are not\r\ntrue!’”\r\n\r\nIn the height of his triumph, Michel Ardan had to encounter all the\r\nannoyances incidental to a man of celebrity. Managers of entertainments\r\nwanted to exhibit him. Barnum offered him a million dollars to make a\r\ntour of the United States in his show. As for his photographs, they\r\nwere sold of all size, and his portrait taken in every imaginable\r\nposture. More than half a million copies were disposed of in an\r\nincredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\nBut it was not only the men who paid him homage, but the women as well.\r\nHe might have married well a hundred times over, if he had been willing\r\nto settle in life. The old maids, in particular, of forty years and\r\nupward, and dry in proportion, devoured his photographs day and night.\r\nThey would have married him by hundreds, even if he had imposed upon\r\nthem the condition of accompanying him into space. He had, however, no\r\nintention of transplanting a race of Franco-Americans upon the surface\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nHe therefore declined all offers.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he could withdraw from these somewhat embarrassing\r\ndemonstrations, he went, accompanied by his friends, to pay a visit to\r\nthe Columbiad. He was highly gratified by his inspection, and made the\r\ndescent to the bottom of the tube of this gigantic machine which was\r\npresently to launch him to the regions of the moon. It is necessary\r\nhere to mention a proposal of J. T. Maston’s. When the secretary of the\r\nGun Club found that Barbicane and Nicholl accepted the proposal of\r\nMichel Ardan, he determined to join them, and make one of a smug party\r\nof four. So one day he determined to be admitted as one of the\r\ntravelers. Barbicane, pained at having to refuse him, gave him clearly\r\nto understand that the projectile could not possibly contain so many\r\npassengers. Maston, in despair, went in search of Michel Ardan, who\r\ncounseled him to resign himself to the situation, adding one or two\r\narguments _ad hominem_.\r\n\r\n“You see, old fellow,” he said, “you must not take what I say in bad\r\npart; but really, between ourselves, you are in too incomplete a\r\ncondition to appear in the moon!”\r\n\r\n“Incomplete?” shrieked the valiant invalid.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear fellow! imagine our meeting some of the inhabitants up\r\nthere! Would you like to give them such a melancholy notion of what\r\ngoes on down here? to teach them what war is, to inform them that we\r\nemploy our time chiefly in devouring each other, in smashing arms and\r\nlegs, and that too on a globe which is capable of supporting a hundred\r\nbillions of inhabitants, and which actually does contain nearly two\r\nhundred millions? Why, my worthy friend, we should have to turn you out\r\nof doors!”\r\n\r\n“But still, if you arrive there in pieces, you will be as incomplete as\r\nI am.”\r\n\r\n“Unquestionably,” replied Michel Ardan; “but we shall not.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, a preparatory experiment, tried on the 18th of October, had\r\nyielded the best results and caused the most well-grounded hopes of\r\nsuccess. Barbicane, desirous of obtaining some notion of the effect of\r\nthe shock at the moment of the projectile’s departure, had procured a\r\n38-inch mortar from the arsenal of Pensacola. He had this placed on the\r\nbank of Hillisborough Roads, in order that the shell might fall back\r\ninto the sea, and the shock be thereby destroyed. His object was to\r\nascertain the extent of the shock of departure, and not that of the\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nA hollow projectile had been prepared for this curious experiment. A\r\nthick padding fastened upon a kind of elastic network, made of the best\r\nsteel, lined the inside of the walls. It was a veritable _nest_ most\r\ncarefully wadded.\r\n\r\n“What a pity I can’t find room in there,” said J. T. Maston, regretting\r\nthat his height did not allow of his trying the adventure.\r\n\r\nWithin this shell were shut up a large cat, and a squirrel belonging to\r\nJ. T. Maston, and of which he was particularly fond. They were\r\ndesirous, however, of ascertaining how this little animal, least of all\r\nothers subject to giddiness, would endure this experimental voyage.\r\n\r\nThe mortar was charged with 160 pounds of powder, and the shell placed\r\nin the chamber. On being fired, the projectile rose with great\r\nvelocity, described a majestic parabola, attained a height of about a\r\nthousand feet, and with a graceful curve descended in the midst of the\r\nvessels that lay there at anchor.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment’s loss of time a small boat put off in the direction\r\nof its fall; some divers plunged into the water and attached ropes to\r\nthe handles of the shell, which was quickly dragged on board. Five\r\nminutes did not elapse between the moment of enclosing the animals and\r\nthat of unscrewing the coverlid of their prison.\r\n\r\nArdan, Barbicane, Maston, and Nicholl were present on board the boat,\r\nand assisted at the operation with an interest which may readily be\r\ncomprehended. Hardly had the shell been opened when the cat leaped out,\r\nslightly bruised, but full of life, and exhibiting no signs whatever of\r\nhaving made an aerial expedition. No trace, however, of the squirrel\r\ncould be discovered. The truth at last became apparent—the cat had\r\neaten its fellow-traveler!\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston grieved much for the loss of his poor squirrel, and\r\nproposed to add its case to that of other martyrs to science.\r\n\r\nAfter this experiment all hesitation, all fear disappeared. Besides,\r\nBarbicane’s plans would ensure greater perfection for his projectile,\r\nand go far to annihilate altogether the effects of the shock. Nothing\r\nnow remained but to go!\r\n\r\nTwo days later Michel Ardan received a message from the President of\r\nthe United States, an honor of which he showed himself especially\r\nsensible.\r\n\r\nAfter the example of his illustrious fellow-countryman, the Marquis de\r\nla Fayette, the government had decreed to him the title of “Citizen of\r\nthe United States of America.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHE PROJECTILE-VEHICLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the Columbiad the public interest centered in the\r\nprojectile itself, the vehicle which was destined to carry the three\r\nhardy adventurers into space.\r\n\r\nThe new plans had been sent to Breadwill and Co., of Albany, with the\r\nrequest for their speedy execution. The projectile was consequently\r\ncast on the 2nd of November, and immediately forwarded by the Eastern\r\nRailway to Stones Hill, which it reached without accident on the 10th\r\nof that month, where Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl were waiting\r\nimpatiently for it.\r\n\r\nThe projectile had now to be filled to the depth of three feet with a\r\nbed of water, intended to support a water-tight wooden disc, which\r\nworked easily within the walls of the projectile. It was upon this kind\r\nof raft that the travelers were to take their place. This body of water\r\nwas divided by horizontal partitions, which the shock of the departure\r\nwould have to break in succession. Then each sheet of the water, from\r\nthe lowest to the highest, running off into escape tubes toward the top\r\nof the projectile, constituted a kind of spring; and the wooden disc,\r\nsupplied with extremely powerful plugs, could not strike the lowest\r\nplate except after breaking successively the different partitions.\r\nUndoubtedly the travelers would still have to encounter a violent\r\nrecoil after the complete escapement of the water; but the first shock\r\nwould be almost entirely destroyed by this powerful spring. The upper\r\nparts of the walls were lined with a thick padding of leather, fastened\r\nupon springs of the best steel, behind which the escape tubes were\r\ncompletely concealed; thus all imaginable precautions had been taken\r\nfor averting the first shock; and if they did get crushed, they must,\r\nas Michel Ardan said, be made of very bad materials.\r\n\r\nThe entrance into this metallic tower was by a narrow aperture\r\ncontrived in the wall of the cone. This was hermetically closed by a\r\nplate of aluminum, fastened internally by powerful screw-pressure. The\r\ntravelers could therefore quit their prison at pleasure, as soon as\r\nthey should reach the moon.\r\n\r\nLight and view were given by means of four thick lenticular glass\r\nscuttles, two pierced in the circular wall itself, the third in the\r\nbottom, the fourth in the top. These scuttles then were protected\r\nagainst the shock of departure by plates let into solid grooves, which\r\ncould easily be opened outward by unscrewing them from the inside.\r\nReservoirs firmly fixed contained water and the necessary provisions;\r\nand fire and light were procurable by means of gas, contained in a\r\nspecial reservoir under a pressure of several atmospheres. They had\r\nonly to turn a tap, and for six hours the gas would light and warm this\r\ncomfortable vehicle.\r\n\r\nThere now remained only the question of air; for allowing for the\r\nconsumption of air by Barbicane, his two companions, and two dogs which\r\nhe proposed taking with him, it was necessary to renew the air of the\r\nprojectile. Now air consists principally of twenty-one parts of oxygen\r\nand seventy-nine of nitrogen. The lungs absorb the oxygen, which is\r\nindispensable for the support of life, and reject the nitrogen. The air\r\nexpired loses nearly five per cent. of the former and contains nearly\r\nan equal volume of carbonic acid, produced by the combustion of the\r\nelements of the blood. In an air-tight enclosure, then, after a certain\r\ntime, all the oxygen of the air will be replaced by the carbonic acid—a\r\ngas fatal to life. There were two things to be done then—first, to\r\nreplace the absorbed oxygen; secondly, to destroy the expired carbonic\r\nacid; both easy enough to do, by means of chlorate of potassium and\r\ncaustic potash. The former is a salt which appears under the form of\r\nwhite crystals; when raised to a temperature of 400 degrees it is\r\ntransformed into chlorure of potassium, and the oxygen which it\r\ncontains is entirely liberated. Now twenty-eight pounds of chlorate of\r\npotassium produces seven pounds of oxygen, or 2,400 litres—the quantity\r\nnecessary for the travelers during twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCaustic potash has a great affinity for carbonic acid; and it is\r\nsufficient to shake it in order for it to seize upon the acid and form\r\nbicarbonate of potassium. By these two means they would be enabled to\r\nrestore to the vitiated air its life- supporting properties.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to add that the experiments had hitherto been\r\nmade _in anima vili_. Whatever its scientific accuracy was, they were\r\nat present ignorant how it would answer with human beings. The honor of\r\nputting it to the proof was energetically claimed by J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“Since I am not to go,” said the brave artillerist, “I may at least\r\nlive for a week in the projectile.”\r\n\r\nIt would have been hard to refuse him; so they consented to his wish. A\r\nsufficient quantity of chlorate of potassium and of caustic potash was\r\nplaced at his disposal, together with provisions for eight days. And\r\nhaving shaken hands with his friends, on the 12th of November, at six\r\no’clock A.M., after strictly informing them not to open his prison\r\nbefore the 20th, at six o’clock P.M., he slid down the projectile, the\r\nplate of which was at once hermetically sealed. What did he do with\r\nhimself during that week? They could get no information. The thickness\r\nof the walls of the projectile prevented any sound reaching from the\r\ninside to the outside. On the 20th of November, at six P.M. exactly,\r\nthe plate was opened. The friends of J. T. Maston had been all along in\r\na state of much anxiety; but they were promptly reassured on hearing a\r\njolly voice shouting a boisterous hurrah.\r\n\r\nPresently afterward the secretary of the Gun Club appeared at the top\r\nof the cone in a triumphant attitude. He had grown fat!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nTHE TELESCOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October in the preceding year, after the close of the\r\nsubscription, the president of the Gun Club had credited the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge with the necessary sums for the construction\r\nof a gigantic optical instrument. This instrument was designed for the\r\npurpose of rendering visible on the surface of the moon any object\r\nexceeding nine feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the Gun Club essayed their great experiment, such\r\ninstruments had reached a high degree of perfection, and produced some\r\nmagnificent results. Two telescopes in particular, at this time, were\r\npossessed of remarkable power and of gigantic dimensions. The first,\r\nconstructed by Herschel, was thirty-six feet in length, and had an\r\nobject-glass of four feet six inches; it possessed a magnifying power\r\nof 6,000. The second was raised in Ireland, in Parsonstown Park, and\r\nbelongs to Lord Rosse. The length of this tube is forty-eight feet, and\r\nthe diameter of its object-glass six feet; it magnifies 6,400 times,\r\nand required an immense erection of brick work and masonry for the\r\npurpose of working it, its weight being twelve and a half tons.\r\n\r\nStill, despite these colossal dimensions, the actual enlargements\r\nscarcely exceeded 6,000 times in round numbers; consequently, the moon\r\nwas brought within no nearer an apparent distance than thirty-nine\r\nmiles; and objects of less than sixty feet in diameter, unless they\r\nwere of very considerable length, were still imperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, dealing with a projectile nine feet in diameter\r\nand fifteen feet long, it became necessary to bring the moon within an\r\napparent distance of five miles at most; and for that purpose to\r\nestablish a magnifying power of 48,000 times.\r\n\r\nSuch was the question proposed to the Observatory of Cambridge, There\r\nwas no lack of funds; the difficulty was purely one of construction.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable discussion as to the best form and principle of the\r\nproposed instrument the work was finally commenced. According to the\r\ncalculations of the Observatory of Cambridge, the tube of the new\r\nreflector would require to be 280 feet in length, and the object-glass\r\nsixteen feet in diameter. Colossal as these dimensions may appear, they\r\nwere diminutive in comparison with the 10,000 foot telescope proposed\r\nby the astronomer Hooke only a few years ago!\r\n\r\nRegarding the choice of locality, that matter was promptly determined.\r\nThe object was to select some lofty mountain, and there are not many of\r\nthese in the United States. In fact there are but two chains of\r\nmoderate elevation, between which runs the magnificent Mississippi, the\r\n“king of rivers” as these Republican Yankees delight to call it.\r\n\r\nEastwards rise the Appalachians, the very highest point of which, in\r\nNew Hampshire, does not exceed the very moderate altitude of 5,600\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOn the west, however, rise the Rocky Mountains, that immense range\r\nwhich, commencing at the Straights of Magellan, follows the western\r\ncoast of Southern America under the name of the Andes or the\r\nCordilleras, until it crosses the Isthmus of Panama, and runs up the\r\nwhole of North America to the very borders of the Polar Sea. The\r\nhighest elevation of this range still does not exceed 10,700 feet. With\r\nthis elevation, nevertheless, the Gun Club were compelled to be\r\ncontent, inasmuch as they had determined that both telescope and\r\nColumbiad should be erected within the limits of the Union. All the\r\nnecessary apparatus was consequently sent on to the summit of Long’s\r\nPeak, in the territory of Missouri.\r\n\r\nNeither pen nor language can describe the difficulties of all kinds\r\nwhich the American engineers had to surmount, of the prodigies of\r\ndaring and skill which they accomplished. They had to raise enormous\r\nstones, massive pieces of wrought iron, heavy corner-clamps and huge\r\nportions of cylinder, with an object-glass weighing nearly 30,000\r\npounds, above the line of perpetual snow for more than 10,000 feet in\r\nheight, after crossing desert prairies, impenetrable forests, fearful\r\nrapids, far from all centers of population, and in the midst of savage\r\nregions, in which every detail of life becomes an almost insoluble\r\nproblem. And yet, notwithstanding these innumerable obstacles, American\r\ngenius triumphed. In less than a year after the commencement of the\r\nworks, toward the close of September, the gigantic reflector rose into\r\nthe air to a height of 280 feet. It was raised by means of an enormous\r\niron crane; an ingenious mechanism allowed it to be easily worked\r\ntoward all the points of the heavens, and to follow the stars from the\r\none horizon to the other during their journey through the heavens.\r\n\r\nIt had cost $400,000. The first time it was directed toward the moon\r\nthe observers evinced both curiosity and anxiety. What were they about\r\nto discover in the field of this telescope which magnified objects\r\n48,000 times? Would they perceive peoples, herds of lunar animals,\r\ntowns, lakes, seas? No! there was nothing which science had not already\r\ndiscovered! and on all the points of its disc the volcanic nature of\r\nthe moon became determinable with the utmost precision.\r\n\r\nBut the telescope of the Rocky Mountains, before doing its duty to the\r\nGun Club, rendered immense services to astronomy. Thanks to its\r\npenetrative power, the depths of the heavens were sounded to the utmost\r\nextent; the apparent diameter of a great number of stars was accurately\r\nmeasured; and Mr. Clark, of the Cambridge staff, resolved the Crab\r\nnebula in Taurus, which the reflector of Lord Rosse had never been able\r\nto decompose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nFINAL DETAILS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the 22nd of November; the departure was to take place in ten\r\ndays. One operation alone remained to be accomplished to bring all to a\r\nhappy termination; an operation delicate and perilous, requiring\r\ninfinite precautions, and against the success of which Captain Nicholl\r\nhad laid his third bet. It was, in fact, nothing less than the loading\r\nof the Columbiad, and the introduction into it of 400,000 pounds of\r\ngun-cotton. Nicholl had thought, not perhaps without reason, that the\r\nhandling of such formidable quantities of pyroxyle would, in all\r\nprobability, involve a grave catastrophe; and at any rate, that this\r\nimmense mass of eminently inflammable matter would inevitably ignite\r\nwhen submitted to the pressure of the projectile.\r\n\r\nThere were indeed dangers accruing as before from the carelessness of\r\nthe Americans, but Barbicane had set his heart on success, and took all\r\npossible precautions. In the first place, he was very careful as to the\r\ntransportation of the gun-cotton to Stones Hill. He had it conveyed in\r\nsmall quantities, carefully packed in sealed cases. These were brought\r\nby rail from Tampa Town to the camp, and from thence were taken to the\r\nColumbiad by barefooted workmen, who deposited them in their places by\r\nmeans of cranes placed at the orifice of the cannon. No steam-engine\r\nwas permitted to work, and every fire was extinguished within two miles\r\nof the works.\r\n\r\nEven in November they feared to work by day, lest the sun’s rays acting\r\non the gun-cotton might lead to unhappy results. This led to their\r\nworking at night, by light produced in a vacuum by means of Ruhmkorff’s\r\napparatus, which threw an artificial brightness into the depths of the\r\nColumbiad. There the cartridges were arranged with the utmost\r\nregularity, connected by a metallic thread, destined to communicate to\r\nthem all simultaneously the electric spark, by which means this mass of\r\ngun-cotton was eventually to be ignited.\r\n\r\nBy the 28th of November eight hundred cartridges had been placed in the\r\nbottom of the Columbiad. So far the operation had been successful! But\r\nwhat confusion, what anxieties, what struggles were undergone by\r\nPresident Barbicane! In vain had he refused admission to Stones Hill;\r\nevery day the inquisitive neighbors scaled the palisades, some even\r\ncarrying their imprudence to the point of smoking while surrounded by\r\nbales of gun-cotton. Barbicane was in a perpetual state of alarm. J. T.\r\nMaston seconded him to the best of his ability, by giving vigorous\r\nchase to the intruders, and carefully picking up the still lighted\r\ncigar ends which the Yankees threw about. A somewhat difficult task!\r\nseeing that more than 300,000 persons were gathered round the\r\nenclosure. Michel Ardan had volunteered to superintend the transport of\r\nthe cartridges to the mouth of the Columbiad; but the president, having\r\nsurprised him with an enormous cigar in his mouth, while he was hunting\r\nout the rash spectators to whom he himself offered so dangerous an\r\nexample, saw that he could not trust this fearless smoker, and was\r\ntherefore obliged to mount a special guard over him.\r\n\r\nAt last, Providence being propitious, this wonderful loading came to a\r\nhappy termination, Captain Nicholl’s third bet being thus lost. It\r\nremained now to introduce the projectile into the Columbiad, and to\r\nplace it on its soft bed of gun-cotton.\r\n\r\nBut before doing this, all those things necessary for the journey had\r\nto be carefully arranged in the projectile vehicle. These necessaries\r\nwere numerous; and had Ardan been allowed to follow his own wishes,\r\nthere would have been no space remaining for the travelers. It is\r\nimpossible to conceive of half the things this charming Frenchman\r\nwished to convey to the moon. A veritable stock of useless trifles! But\r\nBarbicane interfered and refused admission to anything not absolutely\r\nneeded. Several thermometers, barometers, and telescopes were packed in\r\nthe instrument case.\r\n\r\nThe travelers being desirous of examing the moon carefully during their\r\nvoyage, in order to facilitate their studies, they took with them Boeer\r\nand Moeller’s excellent _Mappa Selenographica_, a masterpiece of\r\npatience and observation, which they hoped would enable them to\r\nidentify those physical features in the moon, with which they were\r\nacquainted. This map reproduced with scrupulous fidelity the smallest\r\ndetails of the lunar surface which faces the earth; the mountains,\r\nvalleys, craters, peaks, and ridges were all represented, with their\r\nexact dimensions, relative positions, and names; from the mountains\r\nDoerfel and Leibnitz on the eastern side of the disc, to the _Mare\r\nfrigoris_ of the North Pole.\r\n\r\nThey took also three rifles and three fowling-pieces, and a large\r\nquantity of balls, shot, and powder.\r\n\r\n“We cannot tell whom we shall have to deal with,” said Michel Ardan.\r\n“Men or beasts may possibly object to our visit. It is only wise to\r\ntake all precautions.”\r\n\r\nThese defensive weapons were accompanied by pickaxes, crowbars, saws,\r\nand other useful implements, not to mention clothing adapted to every\r\ntemperature, from that of polar regions to that of the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nArdan wished to convey a number of animals of different sorts, not\r\nindeed a pair of every known species, as he could not see the necessity\r\nof acclimatizing serpents, tigers, alligators, or any other noxious\r\nbeasts in the moon. “Nevertheless,” he said to Barbicane, “some\r\nvaluable and useful beasts, bullocks, cows, horses, and donkeys, would\r\nbear the journey very well, and would also be very useful to us.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say, my dear Ardan,” replied the president, “but our\r\nprojectile-vehicle is no Noah’s ark, from which it differs both in\r\ndimensions and object. Let us confine ourselves to possibilities.”\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged discussion, it was agreed that the travelers should\r\nrestrict themselves to a sporting-dog belonging to Nicholl, and to a\r\nlarge Newfoundland. Several packets of seeds were also included among\r\nthe necessaries. Michel Ardan, indeed, was anxious to add some sacks\r\nfull of earth to sow them in; as it was, he took a dozen shrubs\r\ncarefully wrapped up in straw to plant in the moon.\r\n\r\nThe important question of provisions still remained; it being necessary\r\nto provide against the possibility of their finding the moon absolutely\r\nbarren. Barbicane managed so successfully, that he supplied them with\r\nsufficient rations for a year. These consisted of preserved meats and\r\nvegetables, reduced by strong hydraulic pressure to the smallest\r\npossible dimensions. They were also supplied with brandy, and took\r\nwater enough for two months, being confident, from astronomical\r\nobservations, that there was no lack of water on the moon’s surface. As\r\nto provisions, doubtless the inhabitants of the _earth_ would find\r\nnourishment somewhere in the _moon_. Ardan never questioned this;\r\nindeed, had he done so, he would never have undertaken the journey.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” he said one day to his friends, “we shall not be completely\r\nabandoned by our terrestrial friends; they will take care not to forget\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed!” replied J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“Nothing would be simpler,” replied Ardan; “the Columbiad will be\r\nalways there. Well! whenever the moon is in a favorable condition as to\r\nthe zenith, if not to the perigee, that is to say about once a year,\r\ncould you not send us a shell packed with provisions, which we might\r\nexpect on some appointed day?”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! hurrah!” cried J. T. Matson; “what an ingenious fellow! what a\r\nsplendid idea! Indeed, my good friends, we shall not forget you!”\r\n\r\n“I shall reckon upon you! Then, you see, we shall receive news\r\nregularly from the earth, and we shall indeed be stupid if we hit upon\r\nno plan for communicating with our good friends here!”\r\n\r\nThese words inspired such confidence, that Michel Ardan carried all the\r\nGun Club with him in his enthusiasm. What he said seemed so simple and\r\nso easy, so sure of success, that none could be so sordidly attached to\r\nthis earth as to hesitate to follow the three travelers on their lunar\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nAll being ready at last, it remained to place the projectile in the\r\nColumbiad, an operation abundantly accompanied by dangers and\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThe enormous shell was conveyed to the summit of Stones Hill. There,\r\npowerful cranes raised it, and held it suspended over the mouth of the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful moment! What if the chains should break under its\r\nenormous weight? The sudden fall of such a body would inevitably cause\r\nthe gun-cotton to explode!\r\n\r\nFortunately this did not happen; and some hours later the\r\nprojectile-vehicle descended gently into the heart of the cannon and\r\nrested on its couch of pyroxyle, a veritable bed of explosive\r\neider-down. Its pressure had no result, other than the more effectual\r\nramming down of the charge in the Columbiad.\r\n\r\n“I have lost,” said the captain, who forthwith paid President Barbicane\r\nthe sum of three thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not wish to accept the money from one of his\r\nfellow-travelers, but gave way at last before the determination of\r\nNicholl, who wished before leaving the earth to fulfill all his\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Michel Ardan, “I have only one thing more to wish for you,\r\nmy brave captain.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“It is that you may lose your two other bets! Then we shall be sure not\r\nto be stopped on our journey!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nFIRE!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of December had arrived! the fatal day! for, if the\r\nprojectile were not discharged that very night at 10h. 48m. 40s. P.M.,\r\nmore than eighteen years must roll by before the moon would again\r\npresent herself under the same conditions of zenith and perigee.\r\n\r\nThe weather was magnificent. Despite the approach of winter, the sun\r\nshone brightly, and bathed in its radiant light that earth which three\r\nof its denizens were about to abandon for a new world.\r\n\r\nHow many persons lost their rest on the night which preceded this\r\nlong-expected day! All hearts beat with disquietude, save only the\r\nheart of Michel Ardan. That imperturbable personage came and went with\r\nhis habitual business-like air, while nothing whatever denoted that any\r\nunusual matter preoccupied his mind.\r\n\r\nAfter dawn, an innumerable multitude covered the prairie which extends,\r\nas far as the eye can reach, round Stones Hill. Every quarter of an\r\nhour the railway brought fresh accessions of sightseers; and, according\r\nto the statement of the Tampa Town _Observer_, not less than five\r\nmillions of spectators thronged the soil of Florida.\r\n\r\nFor a whole month previously, the mass of these persons had bivouacked\r\nround the enclosure, and laid the foundations for a town which was\r\nafterward called “Ardan’s Town.” The whole plain was covered with huts,\r\ncottages, and tents. Every nation under the sun was represented there;\r\nand every language might be heard spoken at the same time. It was a\r\nperfect Babel re-enacted. All the various classes of American society\r\nwere mingled together in terms of absolute equality. Bankers, farmers,\r\nsailors, cotton-planters, brokers, merchants, watermen, magistrates,\r\nelbowed each other in the most free-and-easy way. Louisiana Creoles\r\nfraternized with farmers from Indiana; Kentucky and Tennessee gentlemen\r\nand haughty Virginians conversed with trappers and the half-savages of\r\nthe lakes and butchers from Cincinnati. Broad-brimmed white hats and\r\nPanamas, blue-cotton trousers, light-colored stockings, cambric frills,\r\nwere all here displayed; while upon shirt-fronts, wristbands, and\r\nneckties, upon every finger, even upon the very ears, they wore an\r\nassortment of rings, shirt-pins, brooches, and trinkets, of which the\r\nvalue only equaled the execrable taste. Women, children, and servants,\r\nin equally expensive dress, surrounded their husbands, fathers, or\r\nmasters, who resembled the patriarchs of tribes in the midst of their\r\nimmense households.\r\n\r\nAt meal-times all fell to work upon the dishes peculiar to the Southern\r\nStates, and consumed with an appetite that threatened speedy exhaustion\r\nof the victualing powers of Florida, fricasseed frogs, stuffed monkey,\r\nfish chowder, underdone ’possum, and raccoon steaks. And as for the\r\nliquors which accompanied this indigestible repast! The shouts, the\r\nvociferations that resounded through the bars and taverns decorated\r\nwith glasses, tankards, and bottles of marvelous shape, mortars for\r\npounding sugar, and bundles of straws! “Mint-julep” roars one of the\r\nbarmen; “Claret sangaree!” shouts another; “Cocktail!” “Brandy-smash!”\r\n“Real mint-julep in the new style!” All these cries intermingled\r\nproduced a bewildering and deafening hubbub.\r\n\r\nBut on this day, 1st of December, such sounds were rare. No one thought\r\nof eating or drinking, and at four P.M. there were vast numbers of\r\nspectators who had not even taken their customary lunch! And, a still\r\nmore significant fact, even the national passion for play seemed\r\nquelled for the time under the general excitement of the hour.\r\n\r\nUp till nightfall, a dull, noiseless agitation, such as precedes great\r\ncatastrophes, ran through the anxious multitude. An indescribable\r\nuneasiness pervaded all minds, an indefinable sensation which oppressed\r\nthe heart. Every one wished it was over.\r\n\r\nHowever, about seven o’clock, the heavy silence was dissipated. The\r\nmoon rose above the horizon. Millions of hurrahs hailed her appearance.\r\nShe was punctual to the rendezvous, and shouts of welcome greeted her\r\non all sides, as her pale beams shone gracefully in the clear heavens.\r\nAt this moment the three intrepid travelers appeared. This was the\r\nsignal for renewed cries of still greater intensity. Instantly the vast\r\nassemblage, as with one accord, struck up the national hymn of the\r\nUnited States, and “Yankee Doodle,” sung by five million of hearty\r\nthroats, rose like a roaring tempest to the farthest limits of the\r\natmosphere. Then a profound silence reigned throughout the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman and the two Americans had by this time entered the\r\nenclosure reserved in the center of the multitude. They were\r\naccompanied by the members of the Gun Club, and by deputations sent\r\nfrom all the European Observatories. Barbicane, cool and collected, was\r\ngiving his final directions. Nicholl, with compressed lips, his arms\r\ncrossed behind his back, walked with a firm and measured step. Michel\r\nArdan, always easy, dressed in thorough traveler’s costume, leathern\r\ngaiters on his legs, pouch by his side, in loose velvet suit, cigar in\r\nmouth, was full of inexhaustible gayety, laughing, joking, playing\r\npranks with J. T. Maston. In one word, he was the thorough “Frenchman”\r\n(and worse, a “Parisian”) to the last moment.\r\n\r\nTen o’clock struck! The moment had arrived for taking their places in\r\nthe projectile! The necessary operations for the descent, and the\r\nsubsequent removal of the cranes and scaffolding that inclined over the\r\nmouth of the Columbiad, required a certain period of time.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had regulated his chronometer to the tenth part of a second\r\nby that of Murchison the engineer, who was charged with the duty of\r\nfiring the gun by means of an electric spark. Thus the travelers\r\nenclosed within the projectile were enabled to follow with their eyes\r\nthe impassive needle which marked the precise moment of their\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nThe moment had arrived for saying “good-by!” The scene was a touching\r\none. Despite his feverish gayety, even Michel Ardan was touched. J. T.\r\nMaston had found in his own dry eyes one ancient tear, which he had\r\ndoubtless reserved for the occasion. He dropped it on the forehead of\r\nhis dear president.\r\n\r\n“Can I not go?” he said, “there is still time!”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, old fellow!” replied Barbicane. A few moments later, the\r\nthree fellow-travelers had ensconced themselves in the projectile, and\r\nscrewed down the plate which covered the entrance-aperture. The mouth\r\nof the Columbiad, now completely disencumbered, was open entirely to\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nThe moon advanced upward in a heaven of the purest clearness,\r\noutshining in her passage the twinkling light of the stars. She passed\r\nover the constellation of the Twins, and was now nearing the halfway\r\npoint between the horizon and the zenith. A terrible silence weighed\r\nupon the entire scene! Not a breath of wind upon the earth! not a sound\r\nof breathing from the countless chests of the spectators! Their hearts\r\nseemed afraid to beat! All eyes were fixed upon the yawning mouth of\r\nthe Columbiad.\r\n\r\nMurchison followed with his eye the hand of his chronometer. It wanted\r\nscarce forty seconds to the moment of departure, but each second seemed\r\nto last an age! At the twentieth there was a general shudder, as it\r\noccurred to the minds of that vast assemblage that the bold travelers\r\nshut up within the projectile were also counting those terrible\r\nseconds. Some few cries here and there escaped the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Thirty-five!—thirty-six!—thirty-seven!—thirty-eight!—thirty-nine!—\r\nforty! FIRE!!!”\r\n\r\nInstantly Murchison pressed with his finger the key of the electric\r\nbattery, restored the current of the fluid, and discharged the spark\r\ninto the breech of the Columbiad.\r\n\r\nAn appalling unearthly report followed instantly, such as can be\r\ncompared to nothing whatever known, not even to the roar of thunder, or\r\nthe blast of volcanic explosions! No words can convey the slightest\r\nidea of the terrific sound! An immense spout of fire shot up from the\r\nbowels of the earth as from a crater. The earth heaved up, and with\r\ngreat difficulty some few spectators obtained a momentary glimpse of\r\nthe projectile victoriously cleaving the air in the midst of the fiery\r\nvapors!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nFOUL WEATHER\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when that pyramid of fire rose to a prodigious height\r\ninto the air, the glare of flame lit up the whole of Florida; and for a\r\nmoment day superseded night over a considerable extent of the country.\r\nThis immense canopy of fire was perceived at a distance of one hundred\r\nmiles out at sea, and more than one ship’s captain entered in his log\r\nthe appearance of this gigantic meteor.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the Columbiad was accompanied by a perfect earthquake.\r\nFlorida was shaken to its very depths. The gases of the powder,\r\nexpanded by heat, forced back the atmospheric strata with tremendous\r\nviolence, and this artificial hurricane rushed like a water-spout\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\nNot a single spectator remained on his feet! Men, women children, all\r\nlay prostrate like ears of corn under a tempest. There ensued a\r\nterrible tumult; a large number of persons were seriously injured. J.\r\nT. Maston, who, despite all dictates of prudence, had kept in advance\r\nof the mass, was pitched back 120 feet, shooting like a projectile over\r\nthe heads of his fellow-citizens. Three hundred thousand persons\r\nremained deaf for a time, and as though struck stupefied.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first effects were over, the injured, the deaf, and\r\nlastly, the crowd in general, woke up with frenzied cries. “Hurrah for\r\nArdan! Hurrah for Barbicane! Hurrah for Nicholl!” rose to the skies.\r\nThousands of persons, noses in air, armed with telescopes and\r\nrace-glasses, were questioning space, forgetting all contusions and\r\nemotions in the one idea of watching for the projectile. They looked in\r\nvain! It was no longer to be seen, and they were obliged to wait for\r\ntelegrams from Long’s Peak. The director of the Cambridge Observatory\r\nwas at his post on the Rocky Mountains; and to him, as a skillful and\r\npersevering astronomer, all observations had been confided.\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen phenomenon came in to subject the public impatience\r\nto a severe trial.\r\n\r\nThe weather, hitherto so fine, suddenly changed; the sky became heavy\r\nwith clouds. It could not have been otherwise after the terrible\r\nderangement of the atmospheric strata, and the dispersion of the\r\nenormous quantity of vapor arising from the combustion of 200,000\r\npounds of pyroxyle!\r\n\r\nOn the morrow the horizon was covered with clouds—a thick and\r\nimpenetrable curtain between earth and sky, which unhappily extended as\r\nfar as the Rocky Mountains. It was a fatality! But since man had chosen\r\nso to disturb the atmosphere, he was bound to accept the consequences\r\nof his experiment.\r\n\r\nSupposing, now, that the experiment had succeeded, the travelers having\r\nstarted on the 1st of December, at 10h. 46m. 40s. P.M., were due on the\r\n4th at 0h. P.M. at their destination. So that up to that time it would\r\nhave been very difficult after all to have observed, under such\r\nconditions, a body so small as the shell. Therefore they waited with\r\nwhat patience they might.\r\n\r\nFrom the 4th to the 6th of December inclusive, the weather remaining\r\nmuch the same in America, the great European instruments of Herschel,\r\nRosse, and Foucault, were constantly directed toward the moon, for the\r\nweather was then magnificent; but the comparative weakness of their\r\nglasses prevented any trustworthy observations being made.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th the sky seemed to lighten. They were in hopes now, but their\r\nhope was of but short duration, and at night again thick clouds hid the\r\nstarry vault from all eyes.\r\n\r\nMatters were now becoming serious, when on the 9th the sun reappeared\r\nfor an instant, as if for the purpose of teasing the Americans. It was\r\nreceived with hisses; and wounded, no doubt, by such a reception,\r\nshowed itself very sparing of its rays.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th, no change! J. T. Maston went nearly mad, and great fears\r\nwere entertained regarding the brain of this worthy individual, which\r\nhad hitherto been so well preserved within his gutta-percha cranium.\r\n\r\nBut on the 11th one of those inexplicable tempests peculiar to those\r\nintertropical regions was let loose in the atmosphere. A terrific east\r\nwind swept away the groups of clouds which had been so long gathering,\r\nand at night the semi-disc of the orb of night rode majestically amid\r\nthe soft constellations of the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nA NEW STAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very night, the startling news so impatiently awaited, burst like\r\na thunderbolt over the United States of the Union, and thence, darting\r\nacross the ocean, ran through all the telegraphic wires of the globe.\r\nThe projectile had been detected, thanks to the gigantic reflector of\r\nLong’s Peak! Here is the note received by the director of the\r\nObservatory of Cambridge. It contains the scientific conclusion\r\nregarding this great experiment of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nLONG’S PEAK, December 12. To the Officers of the Observatory of\r\nCambridge. The projectile discharged by the Columbiad at Stones Hill\r\nhas been detected by Messrs. Belfast and J. T. Maston, 12th of\r\nDecember, at 8:47 P.M., the moon having entered her last quarter. This\r\nprojectile has not arrived at its destination. It has passed by the\r\nside; but sufficiently near to be retained by the lunar attraction.\r\n\r\nThe rectilinear movement has thus become changed into a circular motion\r\nof extreme velocity, and it is now pursuing an elliptical orbit round\r\nthe moon, of which it has become a true satellite.\r\n\r\nThe elements of this new star we have as yet been unable to determine;\r\nwe do not yet know the velocity of its passage. The distance which\r\nseparates it from the surface of the moon may be estimated at about\r\n2,833 miles.\r\n\r\nHowever, two hypotheses come here into our consideration.\r\n\r\n1. Either the attraction of the moon will end by drawing them into\r\nitself, and the travelers will attain their destination; or,\r\n\r\n2. The projectile, following an immutable law, will continue to\r\ngravitate round the moon till the end of time.\r\n\r\nAt some future time, our observations will be able to determine this\r\npoint, but till then the experiment of the Gun Club can have no other\r\nresult than to have provided our solar system with a new star. J.\r\nBELFAST.\r\n\r\nTo how many questions did this unexpected _denouement_ give rise? What\r\nmysterious results was the future reserving for the investigation of\r\nscience? At all events, the names of Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel\r\nArdan were certain to be immortalized in the annals of astronomy!\r\n\r\nWhen the dispatch from Long’s Peak had once become known, there was but\r\none universal feeling of surprise and alarm. Was it possible to go to\r\nthe aid of these bold travelers? No! for they had placed themselves\r\nbeyond the pale of humanity, by crossing the limits imposed by the\r\nCreator on his earthly creatures. They had air enough for _two_ months;\r\nthey had victuals enough for _twelve;—but after that?_ There was only\r\none man who would not admit that the situation was desperate—he alone\r\nhad confidence; and that was their devoted friend J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\nBesides, he never let them get out of sight. His home was henceforth\r\nthe post at Long’s Peak; his horizon, the mirror of that immense\r\nreflector. As soon as the moon rose above the horizon, he immediately\r\ncaught her in the field of the telescope; he never let her go for an\r\ninstant out of his sight, and followed her assiduously in her course\r\nthrough the stellar spaces. He watched with untiring patience the\r\npassage of the projectile across her silvery disc, and really the\r\nworthy man remained in perpetual communication with his three friends,\r\nwhom he did not despair of seeing again some day.\r\n\r\n“Those three men,” said he, “have carried into space all the resources\r\nof art, science, and industry. With that, one can do anything; and you\r\nwill see that, some day, they will come out all right.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND THE MOON\r\n\r\nA SEQUEL TO\r\n\r\nFROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY CHAPTER\r\nTHE FIRST PART OF THIS WORK, AND SERVING AS A PREFACE TO THE SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the year 186-, the whole world was greatly excited by a\r\nscientific experiment unprecedented in the annals of science. The\r\nmembers of the Gun Club, a circle of artillerymen formed at Baltimore\r\nafter the American war, conceived the idea of putting themselves in\r\ncommunication with the moon!—yes, with the moon—by sending to her a\r\nprojectile. Their president, Barbicane, the promoter of the enterprise,\r\nhaving consulted the astronomers of the Cambridge Observatory upon the\r\nsubject, took all necessary means to ensure the success of this\r\nextraordinary enterprise, which had been declared practicable by the\r\nmajority of competent judges. After setting on foot a public\r\nsubscription, which realized nearly L1,200,000, they began the gigantic\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAccording to the advice forwarded from the members of the Observatory,\r\nthe gun destined to launch the projectile had to be fixed in a country\r\nsituated between the 0 and 28th degrees of north or south latitude, in\r\norder to aim at the moon when at the zenith; and its initiatory\r\nvelocity was fixed at twelve thousand yards to the second. Launched on\r\nthe 1st of December, at 10hrs. 46m. 40s. P.M., it ought to reach the\r\nmoon four days after its departure, that is on the 5th of December, at\r\nmidnight precisely, at the moment of her attaining her perigee, that is\r\nher nearest distance from the earth, which is exactly 86,410 leagues\r\n(French), or 238,833 miles mean distance (English).\r\n\r\nThe principal members of the Gun Club, President Barbicane, Major\r\nElphinstone, the secretary Joseph T. Maston, and other learned men,\r\nheld several meetings, at which the shape and composition of the\r\nprojectile were discussed, also the position and nature of the gun, and\r\nthe quality and quantity of powder to be used. It was decided: First,\r\nthat the projectile should be a shell made of aluminum with a diameter\r\nof 108 inches and a thickness of twelve inches to its walls; and should\r\nweigh 19,250 pounds. Second, that the gun should be a Columbiad cast in\r\niron, 900 feet long, and run perpendicularly into the earth. Third,\r\nthat the charge should contain 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton, which,\r\ngiving out six billions of litres of gas in rear of the projectile,\r\nwould easily carry it toward the orb of night.\r\n\r\nThese questions determined President Barbicane, assisted by Murchison\r\nthe engineer, to choose a spot situated in Florida, in 27° 7′ North\r\nlatitude, and 77° 3′ West (Greenwich) longitude. It was on this spot,\r\nafter stupendous labor, that the Columbiad was cast with full success.\r\nThings stood thus, when an incident took place which increased the\r\ninterest attached to this great enterprise a hundredfold.\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, an enthusiastic Parisian, as witty as he was bold, asked\r\nto be enclosed in the projectile, in order that he might reach the\r\nmoon, and reconnoiter this terrestrial satellite. The name of this\r\nintrepid adventurer was Michel Ardan. He landed in America, was\r\nreceived with enthusiasm, held meetings, saw himself carried in\r\ntriumph, reconciled President Barbicane to his mortal enemy, Captain\r\nNicholl, and, as a token of reconciliation, persuaded them both to\r\nstart with him in the projectile. The proposition being accepted, the\r\nshape of the projectile was slightly altered. It was made of a\r\ncylindro-conical form. This species of aerial car was lined with strong\r\nsprings and partitions to deaden the shock of departure. It was\r\nprovided with food for a year, water for some months, and gas for some\r\ndays. A self-acting apparatus supplied the three travelers with air to\r\nbreathe. At the same time, on one of the highest points of the Rocky\r\nMountains, the Gun Club had a gigantic telescope erected, in order that\r\nthey might be able to follow the course of the projectile through\r\nspace. All was then ready.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of November, at the hour fixed upon, from the midst of an\r\nextraordinary crowd of spectators, the departure took place, and for\r\nthe first time, three human beings quitted the terrestrial globe, and\r\nlaunched into inter-planetary space with almost a certainty of reaching\r\ntheir destination. These bold travelers, Michel Ardan, President\r\nBarbicane, and Captain Nicholl, ought to make the passage in\r\nninety-seven hours, thirteen minutes, and twenty seconds. Consequently,\r\ntheir arrival on the lunar disc could not take place until the 5th of\r\nDecember at twelve at night, at the exact moment when the moon should\r\nbe full, and not on the 4th, as some badly informed journalists had\r\nannounced.\r\n\r\nBut an unforeseen circumstance, viz., the detonation produced by the\r\nColumbiad, had the immediate effect of troubling the terrestrial\r\natmosphere, by accumulating a large quantity of vapor, a phenomenon\r\nwhich excited universal indignation, for the moon was hidden from the\r\neyes of the watchers for several nights.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Joseph T. Maston, the staunchest friend of the three\r\ntravelers, started for the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the Hon. J.\r\nBelfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, and reached the station\r\nof Long’s Peak, where the telescope was erected which brought the moon\r\nwithin an apparent distance of two leagues. The honorable secretary of\r\nthe Gun Club wished himself to observe the vehicle of his daring\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of the clouds in the atmosphere prevented all\r\nobservation on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th of December.\r\nIndeed it was thought that all observations would have to be put off to\r\nthe 3d of January in the following year; for the moon entering its last\r\nquarter on the 11th, would then only present an ever-decreasing portion\r\nof her disc, insufficient to allow of their following the course of the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nAt length, to the general satisfaction, a heavy storm cleared the\r\natmosphere on the night of the 11th and 12th of December, and the moon,\r\nwith half-illuminated disc, was plainly to be seen upon the black sky.\r\n\r\nThat very night a telegram was sent from the station of Long’s Peak by\r\nJoseph T. Maston and Belfast to the gentlemen of the Cambridge\r\nObservatory, announcing that on the 11th of December at 8h. 47m. P.M.,\r\nthe projectile launched by the Columbiad of Stones Hill had been\r\ndetected by Messrs. Belfast and Maston—that it had deviated from its\r\ncourse from some unknown cause, and had not reached its destination;\r\nbut that it had passed near enough to be retained by the lunar\r\nattraction; that its rectilinear movement had been changed to a\r\ncircular one, and that following an elliptical orbit round the star of\r\nnight it had become its satellite. The telegram added that the elements\r\nof this new star had not yet been calculated; and indeed three\r\nobservations made upon a star in three different positions are\r\nnecessary to determine these elements. Then it showed that the distance\r\nseparating the projectile from the lunar surface “might” be reckoned at\r\nabout 2,833 miles.\r\n\r\nIt ended with the double hypothesis: either the attraction of the moon\r\nwould draw it to herself, and the travelers thus attain their end; or\r\nthat the projectile, held in one immutable orbit, would gravitate\r\naround the lunar disc to all eternity.\r\n\r\nWith such alternatives, what would be the fate of the travelers?\r\nCertainly they had food for some time. But supposing they did succeed\r\nin their rash enterprise, how would they return? Could they ever\r\nreturn? Should they hear from them? These questions, debated by the\r\nmost learned pens of the day, strongly engrossed the public attention.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable here to make a remark which ought to be well considered\r\nby hasty observers. When a purely speculative discovery is announced to\r\nthe public, it cannot be done with too much prudence. No one is obliged\r\nto discover either a planet, a comet, or a satellite; and whoever makes\r\na mistake in such a case exposes himself justly to the derision of the\r\nmass. Far better is it to wait; and that is what the impatient Joseph\r\nT. Maston should have done before sending this telegram forth to the\r\nworld, which, according to his idea, told the whole result of the\r\nenterprise. Indeed this telegram contained two sorts of errors, as was\r\nproved eventually. First, errors of observation, concerning the\r\ndistance of the projectile from the surface of the moon, for on the\r\n11th of December it was impossible to see it; and what Joseph T. Maston\r\nhad seen, or thought he saw, could not have been the projectile of the\r\nColumbiad. Second, errors of theory on the fate in store for the said\r\nprojectile; for in making it a satellite of the moon, it was putting it\r\nin direct contradiction of all mechanical laws.\r\n\r\nOne single hypothesis of the observers of Long’s Peak could ever be\r\nrealized, that which foresaw the case of the travelers (if still alive)\r\nuniting their efforts with the lunar attraction to attain the surface\r\nof the disc.\r\n\r\nNow these men, as clever as they were daring, had survived the terrible\r\nshock consequent on their departure, and it is their journey in the\r\nprojectile car which is here related in its most dramatic as well as in\r\nits most singular details. This recital will destroy many illusions and\r\nsurmises; but it will give a true idea of the singular changes in store\r\nfor such an enterprise; it will bring out the scientific instincts of\r\nBarbicane, the industrious resources of Nicholl, and the audacious\r\nhumor of Michel Ardan. Besides this, it will prove that their worthy\r\nfriend, Joseph T. Maston, was wasting his time, while leaning over the\r\ngigantic telescope he watched the course of the moon through the starry\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTWENTY MINUTES PAST TEN TO FORTY-SEVEN MINUTES PAST TEN P. M.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs ten o’clock struck, Michel Ardan, Barbicane, and Nicholl, took leave\r\nof the numerous friends they were leaving on the earth. The two dogs,\r\ndestined to propagate the canine race on the lunar continents, were\r\nalready shut up in the projectile.\r\n\r\nThe three travelers approached the orifice of the enormous cast-iron\r\ntube, and a crane let them down to the conical top of the projectile.\r\nThere, an opening made for the purpose gave them access to the aluminum\r\ncar. The tackle belonging to the crane being hauled from outside, the\r\nmouth of the Columbiad was instantly disencumbered of its last\r\nsupports.\r\n\r\nNicholl, once introduced with his companions inside the projectile,\r\nbegan to close the opening by means of a strong plate, held in position\r\nby powerful screws. Other plates, closely fitted, covered the\r\nlenticular glasses, and the travelers, hermetically enclosed in their\r\nmetal prison, were plunged in profound darkness.\r\n\r\n“And now, my dear companions,” said Michel Ardan, “let us make\r\nourselves at home; I am a domesticated man and strong in housekeeping.\r\nWe are bound to make the best of our new lodgings, and make ourselves\r\ncomfortable. And first let us try and see a little. Gas was not\r\ninvented for moles.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the thoughtless fellow lit a match by striking it on the\r\nsole of his boot; and approached the burner fixed to the receptacle, in\r\nwhich the carbonized hydrogen, stored at high pressure, sufficed for\r\nthe lighting and warming of the projectile for a hundred and forty-four\r\nhours, or six days and six nights. The gas caught fire, and thus\r\nlighted the projectile looked like a comfortable room with thickly\r\npadded walls, furnished with a circular divan, and a roof rounded in\r\nthe shape of a dome.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan examined everything, and declared himself satisfied with\r\nhis installation.\r\n\r\n“It is a prison,” said he, “but a traveling prison; and, with the right\r\nof putting my nose to the window, I could well stand a lease of a\r\nhundred years. You smile, Barbicane. Have you any _arriere-pensee_? Do\r\nyou say to yourself, ‘This prison may be our tomb?’ Tomb, perhaps;\r\nstill I would not change it for Mahomet’s, which floats in space but\r\nnever advances an inch!”\r\n\r\nWhile Michel Ardan was speaking, Barbicane and Nicholl were making\r\ntheir last preparations.\r\n\r\nNicholl’s chronometer marked twenty minutes past ten P.M. when the\r\nthree travelers were finally enclosed in their projectile. This\r\nchronometer was set within the tenth of a second by that of Murchison\r\nthe engineer. Barbicane consulted it.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said he, “it is twenty minutes past ten. At forty- seven\r\nminutes past ten Murchison will launch the electric spark on the wire\r\nwhich communicates with the charge of the Columbiad. At that precise\r\nmoment we shall leave our spheroid. Thus we still have twenty-seven\r\nminutes to remain on the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-six minutes thirteen seconds,” replied the methodical Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Well!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, in a good-humored tone, “much may be\r\ndone in twenty-six minutes. The gravest questions of morals and\r\npolitics may be discussed, and even solved. Twenty-six minutes well\r\nemployed are worth more than twenty-six years in which nothing is done.\r\nSome seconds of a Pascal or a Newton are more precious than the whole\r\nexistence of a crowd of raw simpletons—”\r\n\r\n“And you conclude, then, you everlasting talker?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“I conclude that we have twenty-six minutes left,” replied Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-four only,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Well, twenty-four, if you like, my noble captain,” said Ardan;\r\n“twenty-four minutes in which to investigate—”\r\n\r\n“Michel,” said Barbicane, “during the passage we shall have plenty of\r\ntime to investigate the most difficult questions. For the present we\r\nmust occupy ourselves with our departure.”\r\n\r\n“Are we not ready?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but there are still some precautions to be taken, to deaden\r\nas much as possible the first shock.”\r\n\r\n“Have we not the water-cushions placed between the partition- breaks,\r\nwhose elasticity will sufficiently protect us?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so, Michel,” replied Barbicane gently, “but I am not sure.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, the joker!” exclaimed Michel Ardan. “He hopes!—He is not sure!—and\r\nhe waits for the moment when we are encased to make this deplorable\r\nadmission! I beg to be allowed to get out!”\r\n\r\n“And how?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said Michel Ardan, “it is not easy; we are in the train, and\r\nthe guard’s whistle will sound before twenty-four minutes are over.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the three travelers looked at each other. Then they\r\nbegan to examine the objects imprisoned with them.\r\n\r\n“Everything is in its place,” said Barbicane. “We have now to decide\r\nhow we can best place ourselves to resist the shock. Position cannot be\r\nan indifferent matter; and we must, as much as possible, prevent the\r\nrush of blood to the head.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Then,” replied Michel Ardan, ready to suit the action to the word,\r\n“let us put our heads down and our feet in the air, like the clowns in\r\nthe grand circus.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Barbicane, “let us stretch ourselves on our sides; we shall\r\nresist the shock better that way. Remember that, when the projectile\r\nstarts, it matters little whether we are in it or before it; it amounts\r\nto much the same thing.”\r\n\r\n“If it is only ‘much the same thing,’ I may cheer up,” said Michel\r\nArdan.\r\n\r\n“Do you approve of my idea, Nicholl?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Entirely,” replied the captain. “We’ve still thirteen minutes and a\r\nhalf.”\r\n\r\n“That Nicholl is not a man,” exclaimed Michel; “he is a chronometer\r\nwith seconds, an escape, and eight holes.”\r\n\r\nBut his companions were not listening; they were taking up their last\r\npositions with the most perfect coolness. They were like two methodical\r\ntravelers in a car, seeking to place themselves as comfortably as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWe might well ask ourselves of what materials are the hearts of these\r\nAmericans made, to whom the approach of the most frightful danger added\r\nno pulsation.\r\n\r\nThree thick and solidly-made couches had been placed in the projectile.\r\nNicholl and Barbicane placed them in the center of the disc forming the\r\nfloor. There the three travelers were to stretch themselves some\r\nmoments before their departure.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Ardan, not being able to keep still, turned in his\r\nnarrow prison like a wild beast in a cage, chatting with his friends,\r\nspeaking to the dogs Diana and Satellite, to whom, as may be seen, he\r\nhad given significant names.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Diana! Ah, Satellite!” he exclaimed, teasing them; “so you are\r\ngoing to show the moon-dogs the good habits of the dogs of the earth!\r\nThat will do honor to the canine race! If ever we do come down again, I\r\nwill bring a cross type of ‘moon-dogs,’ which will make a stir!”\r\n\r\n“If there _are_ dogs in the moon,” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“There are,” said Michel Ardan, “just as there are horses, cows,\r\ndonkeys, and chickens. I bet that we shall find chickens.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred dollars we shall find none!” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Done, my captain!” replied Ardan, clasping Nicholl’s hand. “But, by\r\nthe bye, you have already lost three bets with our president, as the\r\nnecessary funds for the enterprise have been found, as the operation of\r\ncasting has been successful, and lastly, as the Columbiad has been\r\nloaded without accident, six thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Nicholl. “Thirty-seven minutes six seconds past ten.”\r\n\r\n“It is understood, captain. Well, before another quarter of an hour you\r\nwill have to count nine thousand dollars to the president; four\r\nthousand because the Columbiad will not burst, and five thousand\r\nbecause the projectile will rise more than six miles in the air.”\r\n\r\n“I have the dollars,” replied Nicholl, slapping the pocket of this\r\ncoat. “I only ask to be allowed to pay.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Nicholl. I see that you are a man of method, which I could never\r\nbe; but indeed you have made a series of bets of very little advantage\r\nto yourself, allow me to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“And why?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Because, if you gain the first, the Columbiad will have burst, and the\r\nprojectile with it; and Barbicane will no longer be there to reimburse\r\nyour dollars.”\r\n\r\n“My stake is deposited at the bank in Baltimore,” replied Barbicane\r\nsimply; “and if Nicholl is not there, it will go to his heirs.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you practical men!” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “I admire you the more\r\nfor not being able to understand you.”\r\n\r\n“Forty-two minutes past ten!” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Only five minutes more!” answered Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Yes, five little minutes!” replied Michel Ardan; “and we are enclosed\r\nin a projectile, at the bottom of a gun 900 feet long! And under this\r\nprojectile are rammed 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton, which is equal to\r\n1,600,000 pounds of ordinary powder! And friend Murchison, with his\r\nchronometer in hand, his eye fixed on the needle, his finger on the\r\nelectric apparatus, is counting the seconds preparatory to launching us\r\ninto interplanetary space.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, Michel, enough!” said Barbicane, in a serious voice; “let us\r\nprepare. A few instants alone separate us from an eventful moment. One\r\nclasp of the hand, my friends.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, more moved than he wished to appear; and\r\nthe three bold companions were united in a last embrace.\r\n\r\n“God preserve us!” said the religious Barbicane.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan and Nicholl stretched themselves on the couches placed in\r\nthe center of the disc.\r\n\r\n“Forty-seven minutes past ten!” murmured the captain.\r\n\r\n“Twenty seconds more!” Barbicane quickly put out the gas and lay down\r\nby his companions, and the profound silence was only broken by the\r\nticking of the chronometer marking the seconds.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a dreadful shock was felt, and the projectile, under the force\r\nof six billions of litres of gas, developed by the combustion of\r\npyroxyle, mounted into space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE FIRST HALF-HOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? What effect had this frightful shock produced? Had\r\nthe ingenuity of the constructors of the projectile obtained any happy\r\nresult? Had the shock been deadened, thanks to the springs, the four\r\nplugs, the water-cushions, and the partition-breaks? Had they been able\r\nto subdue the frightful pressure of the initiatory speed of more than\r\n11,000 yards, which was enough to traverse Paris or New York in a\r\nsecond? This was evidently the question suggested to the thousand\r\nspectators of this moving scene. They forgot the aim of the journey,\r\nand thought only of the travelers. And if one of them—Joseph T. Maston\r\nfor example—could have cast one glimpse into the projectile, what would\r\nhe have seen?\r\n\r\nNothing then. The darkness was profound. But its cylindro- conical\r\npartitions had resisted wonderfully. Not a rent or a dent anywhere! The\r\nwonderful projectile was not even heated under the intense deflagration\r\nof the powder, nor liquefied, as they seemed to fear, in a shower of\r\naluminum.\r\n\r\nThe interior showed but little disorder; indeed, only a few objects had\r\nbeen violently thrown toward the roof; but the most important seemed\r\nnot to have suffered from the shock at all; their fixtures were intact.\r\n\r\nOn the movable disc, sunk down to the bottom by the smashing of the\r\npartition-breaks and the escape of the water, three bodies lay\r\napparently lifeless. Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan—did they\r\nstill breathe? or was the projectile nothing now but a metal coffin,\r\nbearing three corpses into space?\r\n\r\nSome minutes after the departure of the projectile, one of the bodies\r\nmoved, shook its arms, lifted its head, and finally succeeded in\r\ngetting on its knees. It was Michel Ardan. He felt himself all over,\r\ngave a sonorous “Hem!” and then said:\r\n\r\n“Michel Ardan is whole. How about the others?”\r\n\r\nThe courageous Frenchman tried to rise, but could not stand. His head\r\nswam, from the rush of blood; he was blind; he was a drunken man.\r\n\r\n“Bur-r!” said he. “It produces the same effect as two bottles of\r\nCorton, though perhaps less agreeable to swallow.” Then, passing his\r\nhand several times across his forehead and rubbing his temples, he\r\ncalled in a firm voice:\r\n\r\n“Nicholl! Barbicane!”\r\n\r\nHe waited anxiously. No answer; not even a sigh to show that the hearts\r\nof his companions were still beating. He called again. The same\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“The devil!” he exclaimed. “They look as if they had fallen from a\r\nfifth story on their heads. Bah!” he added, with that imperturbable\r\nconfidence which nothing could check, “if a Frenchman can get on his\r\nknees, two Americans ought to be able to get on their feet. But first\r\nlet us light up.”\r\n\r\nArdan felt the tide of life return by degrees. His blood became calm,\r\nand returned to its accustomed circulation. Another effort restored his\r\nequilibrium. He succeeded in rising, drew a match from his pocket, and\r\napproaching the burner lighted it. The receiver had not suffered at\r\nall. The gas had not escaped. Besides, the smell would have betrayed\r\nit; and in that case Michel Ardan could not have carried a lighted\r\nmatch with impunity through the space filled with hydrogen. The gas\r\nmixing with the air would have produced a detonating mixture, and the\r\nexplosion would have finished what the shock had perhaps begun. When\r\nthe burner was lit, Ardan leaned over the bodies of his companions:\r\nthey were lying one on the other, an inert mass, Nicholl above,\r\nBarbicane underneath.\r\n\r\nArdan lifted the captain, propped him up against the divan, and began\r\nto rub vigorously. This means, used with judgment, restored Nicholl,\r\nwho opened his eyes, and instantly recovering his presence of mind,\r\nseized Ardan’s hand and looked around him.\r\n\r\n“And Barbicane?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Each in turn,” replied Michel Ardan. “I began with you, Nicholl,\r\nbecause you were on the top. Now let us look to Barbicane.” Saying\r\nwhich, Ardan and Nicholl raised the president of the Gun Club and laid\r\nhim on the divan. He seemed to have suffered more than either of his\r\ncompanions; he was bleeding, but Nicholl was reassured by finding that\r\nthe hemorrhage came from a slight wound on the shoulder, a mere graze,\r\nwhich he bound up carefully.\r\n\r\nStill, Barbicane was a long time coming to himself, which frightened\r\nhis friends, who did not spare friction.\r\n\r\n“He breathes though,” said Nicholl, putting his ear to the chest of the\r\nwounded man.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Ardan, “he breathes like a man who has some notion of\r\nthat daily operation. Rub, Nicholl; let us rub harder.” And the two\r\nimprovised practitioners worked so hard and so well that Barbicane\r\nrecovered his senses. He opened his eyes, sat up, took his two friends\r\nby the hands, and his first words were—\r\n\r\n“Nicholl, are we moving?”\r\n\r\nNicholl and Ardan looked at each other; they had not yet troubled\r\nthemselves about the projectile; their first thought had been for the\r\ntraveler, not for the car.\r\n\r\n“Well, are we really moving?” repeated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Or quietly resting on the soil of Florida?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Or at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico?” added Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“What an idea!” exclaimed the president.\r\n\r\nAnd this double hypothesis suggested by his companions had the effect\r\nof recalling him to his senses. In any case they could not decide on\r\nthe position of the projectile. Its apparent immovability, and the want\r\nof communication with the outside, prevented them from solving the\r\nquestion. Perhaps the projectile was unwinding its course through\r\nspace. Perhaps after a short rise it had fallen upon the earth, or even\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico—a fall which the narrowness of the peninsula of\r\nFlorida would render not impossible.\r\n\r\nThe case was serious, the problem interesting, and one that must be\r\nsolved as soon as possible. Thus, highly excited, Barbicane’s moral\r\nenergy triumphed over physical weakness, and he rose to his feet. He\r\nlistened. Outside was perfect silence; but the thick padding was enough\r\nto intercept all sounds coming from the earth. But one circumstance\r\nstruck Barbicane, viz., that the temperature inside the projectile was\r\nsingularly high. The president drew a thermometer from its case and\r\nconsulted it. The instrument showed 81° Fahr.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he exclaimed, “yes, we are moving! This stifling heat,\r\npenetrating through the partitions of the projectile, is produced by\r\nits friction on the atmospheric strata. It will soon diminish, because\r\nwe are already floating in space, and after having nearly stifled, we\r\nshall have to suffer intense cold.\r\n\r\n“What!” said Michel Ardan. “According to your showing, Barbicane, we\r\nare already beyond the limits of the terrestrial atmosphere?”\r\n\r\n“Without a doubt, Michel. Listen to me. It is fifty-five minutes past\r\nten; we have been gone about eight minutes; and if our initiatory speed\r\nhas not been checked by the friction, six seconds would be enough for\r\nus to pass through the forty miles of atmosphere which surrounds the\r\nglobe.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied Nicholl; “but in what proportion do you estimate the\r\ndiminution of speed by friction?”\r\n\r\n“In the proportion of one-third, Nicholl. This diminution is\r\nconsiderable, but according to my calculations it is nothing less. If,\r\nthen, we had an initiatory speed of 12,000 yards, on leaving the\r\natmosphere this speed would be reduced to 9,165 yards. In any case we\r\nhave already passed through this interval, and—”\r\n\r\n“And then,” said Michel Ardan, “friend Nicholl has lost his two bets:\r\nfour thousand dollars because the Columbiad did not burst; five\r\nthousand dollars because the projectile has risen more than six miles.\r\nNow, Nicholl, pay up.”\r\n\r\n“Let us prove it first,” said the captain, “and we will pay afterward.\r\nIt is quite possible that Barbicane’s reasoning is correct, and that I\r\nhave lost my nine thousand dollars. But a new hypothesis presents\r\nitself to my mind, and it annuls the wager.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Barbicane quickly.\r\n\r\n“The hypothesis that, for some reason or other, fire was never set to\r\nthe powder, and we have not started at all.”\r\n\r\n“My goodness, captain,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “that hypothesis is not\r\nworthy of my brain! It cannot be a serious one. For have we not been\r\nhalf annihilated by the shock? Did I not recall you to life? Is not the\r\npresident’s shoulder still bleeding from the blow it has received?”\r\n\r\n“Granted,” replied Nicholl; “but one question.”\r\n\r\n“Well, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Did you hear the detonation, which certainly ought to be loud?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Ardan, much surprised; “certainly I did not hear the\r\ndetonation.”\r\n\r\n“And you, Barbicane?”\r\n\r\n“Nor I, either.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Well now,” murmured the president “why did we not hear the\r\ndetonation?”\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at each other with a disconcerted air. It was\r\nquite an inexplicable phenomenon. The projectile had started, and\r\nconsequently there must have been a detonation.\r\n\r\n“Let us first find out where we are,” said Barbicane, “and let down\r\nthis panel.”\r\n\r\nThis very simple operation was soon accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe nuts which held the bolts to the outer plates of the right-hand\r\nscuttle gave way under the pressure of the English wrench. These bolts\r\nwere pushed outside, and the buffers covered with India-rubber stopped\r\nup the holes which let them through. Immediately the outer plate fell\r\nback upon its hinges like a porthole, and the lenticular glass which\r\nclosed the scuttle appeared. A similar one was let into the thick\r\npartition on the opposite side of the projectile, another in the top of\r\nthe dome, and finally a fourth in the middle of the base. They could,\r\ntherefore, make observations in four different directions; the\r\nfirmament by the side and most direct windows, the earth or the moon by\r\nthe upper and under openings in the projectile.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his two companions immediately rushed to the uncovered\r\nwindow. But it was lit by no ray of light. Profound darkness surrounded\r\nthem, which, however, did not prevent the president from exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“No, my friends, we have not fallen back upon the earth; no, nor are we\r\nsubmerged in the Gulf of Mexico. Yes! we are mounting into space. See\r\nthose stars shining in the night, and that impenetrable darkness heaped\r\nup between the earth and us!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! hurrah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan and Nicholl in one voice.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this thick darkness proved that the projectile had left the\r\nearth, for the soil, brilliantly lit by the moon-beams would have been\r\nvisible to the travelers, if they had been lying on its surface. This\r\ndarkness also showed that the projectile had passed the atmospheric\r\nstrata, for the diffused light spread in the air would have been\r\nreflected on the metal walls, which reflection was wanting. This light\r\nwould have lit the window, and the window was dark. Doubt was no longer\r\npossible; the travelers had left the earth.\r\n\r\n“I have lost,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“I congratulate you,” replied Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Here are the nine thousand dollars,” said the captain, drawing a roll\r\nof paper dollars from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Will you have a receipt for it?” asked Barbicane, taking the sum.\r\n\r\n“If you do not mind,” answered Nicholl; “it is more business-like.”\r\n\r\nAnd coolly and seriously, as if he had been at his strong-box, the\r\npresident drew forth his notebook, tore out a blank leaf, wrote a\r\nproper receipt in pencil, dated and signed it with the usual\r\nflourish,[1] and gave it to the captain, who carefully placed it in his\r\npocketbook. Michel Ardan, taking off his hat, bowed to his two\r\ncompanions without speaking. So much formality under such circumstances\r\nleft him speechless. He had never before seen anything so “American.”\r\n\r\n [1] This is a purely French habit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis affair settled, Barbicane and Nicholl had returned to the window,\r\nand were watching the constellations. The stars looked like bright\r\npoints on the black sky. But from that side they could not see the orb\r\nof night, which, traveling from east to west, would rise by degrees\r\ntoward the zenith. Its absence drew the following remark from Ardan:\r\n\r\n“And the moon; will she perchance fail at our rendezvous?”\r\n\r\n“Do not alarm yourself,” said Barbicane; “our future globe is at its\r\npost, but we cannot see her from this side; let us open the other.”\r\n\r\n“As Barbicane was about leaving the window to open the opposite\r\nscuttle, his attention was attracted by the approach of a brilliant\r\nobject. It was an enormous disc, whose colossal dimension could not be\r\nestimated. Its face, which was turned to the earth, was very bright.\r\nOne might have thought it a small moon reflecting the light of the\r\nlarge one. She advanced with great speed, and seemed to describe an\r\norbit round the earth, which would intersect the passage of the\r\nprojectile. This body revolved upon its axis, and exhibited the\r\nphenomena of all celestial bodies abandoned in space.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “What is that? another projectile?”\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not answer. The appearance of this enormous body\r\nsurprised and troubled him. A collision was possible, and might be\r\nattended with deplorable results; either the projectile would deviate\r\nfrom its path, or a shock, breaking its impetus, might precipitate it\r\nto earth; or, lastly, it might be irresistibly drawn away by the\r\npowerful asteroid. The president caught at a glance the consequences of\r\nthese three hypotheses, either of which would, one way or the other,\r\nbring their experiment to an unsuccessful and fatal termination. His\r\ncompanions stood silently looking into space. The object grew rapidly\r\nas it approached them, and by an optical illusion the projectile seemed\r\nto be throwing itself before it.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “we shall run into one another!”\r\n\r\nInstinctively the travelers drew back. Their dread was great, but it\r\ndid not last many seconds. The asteroid passed several hundred yards\r\nfrom the projectile and disappeared, not so much from the rapidity of\r\nits course, as that its face being opposite the moon, it was suddenly\r\nmerged into the perfect darkness of space.\r\n\r\n“A happy journey to you,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, with a sigh of\r\nrelief. “Surely infinity of space is large enough for a poor little\r\nprojectile to walk through without fear. Now, what is this portentous\r\nglobe which nearly struck us?”\r\n\r\n“I know,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed! you know everything.”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Barbicane, “a simple meteorite, but an enormous one,\r\nwhich the attraction of the earth has retained as a satellite.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “the earth then has two moons\r\nlike Neptune?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friends, two moons, though it passes generally for having only\r\none; but this second moon is so small, and its speed so great, that the\r\ninhabitants of the earth cannot see it. It was by noticing disturbances\r\nthat a French astronomer, M. Petit, was able to determine the existence\r\nof this second satellite and calculate its elements. According to his\r\nobservations, this meteorite will accomplish its revolution around the\r\nearth in three hours and twenty minutes, which implies a wonderful rate\r\nof speed.”\r\n\r\n“Do all astronomers admit the existence of this satellite?” asked\r\nNicholl.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Barbicane; “but if, like us, they had met it, they could\r\nno longer doubt it. Indeed, I think that this meteorite, which, had it\r\nstruck the projectile, would have much embarrassed us, will give us the\r\nmeans of deciding what our position in space is.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Because its distance is known, and when we met it, we were exactly\r\nfour thousand six hundred and fifty miles from the surface of the\r\nterrestrial globe.”\r\n\r\n“More than two thousand French leagues,” exclaimed Michel Ardan. “That\r\nbeats the express trains of the pitiful globe called the earth.”\r\n\r\n“I should think so,” replied Nicholl, consulting his chronometer; “it\r\nis eleven o’clock, and it is only thirteen minutes since we left the\r\nAmerican continent.”\r\n\r\n“Only thirteen minutes?” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Nicholl; “and if our initiatory speed of twelve thousand\r\nyards has been kept up, we shall have made about twenty thousand miles\r\nin the hour.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very well, my friends,” said the president, “but the\r\ninsoluble question still remains. Why did we not hear the detonation of\r\nthe Columbiad?”\r\n\r\nFor want of an answer the conversation dropped, and Barbicane began\r\nthoughtfully to let down the shutter of the second side. He succeeded;\r\nand through the uncovered glass the moon filled the projectile with a\r\nbrilliant light. Nicholl, as an economical man, put out the gas, now\r\nuseless, and whose brilliancy prevented any observation of the\r\ninter-planetary space.\r\n\r\nThe lunar disc shone with wonderful purity. Her rays, no longer\r\nfiltered through the vapory atmosphere of the terrestrial globe, shone\r\nthrough the glass, filling the air in the interior of the projectile\r\nwith silvery reflections. The black curtain of the firmament in reality\r\nheightened the moon’s brilliancy, which in this void of ether\r\nunfavorable to diffusion did not eclipse the neighboring stars. The\r\nheavens, thus seen, presented quite a new aspect, and one which the\r\nhuman eye could never dream of. One may conceive the interest with\r\nwhich these bold men watched the orb of night, the great aim of their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nIn its motion the earth’s satellite was insensibly nearing the zenith,\r\nthe mathematical point which it ought to attain ninety-six hours later.\r\nHer mountains, her plains, every projection was as clearly discernible\r\nto their eyes as if they were observing it from some spot upon the\r\nearth; but its light was developed through space with wonderful\r\nintensity. The disc shone like a platinum mirror. Of the earth flying\r\nfrom under their feet, the travelers had lost all recollection.\r\n\r\nIt was captain Nicholl who first recalled their attention to the\r\nvanishing globe.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Michel Ardan, “do not let us be ungrateful to it. Since we\r\nare leaving our country, let our last looks be directed to it. I wish\r\nto see the earth once more before it is quite hidden from my eyes.”\r\n\r\nTo satisfy his companions, Barbicane began to uncover the window at the\r\nbottom of the projectile, which would allow them to observe the earth\r\ndirect. The disc, which the force of the projection had beaten down to\r\nthe base, was removed, not without difficulty. Its fragments, placed\r\ncarefully against a wall, might serve again upon occasion. Then a\r\ncircular gap appeared, nineteen inches in diameter, hollowed out of the\r\nlower part of the projectile. A glass cover, six inches thick and\r\nstrengthened with upper fastenings, closed it tightly. Beneath was\r\nfixed an aluminum plate, held in place by bolts. The screws being\r\nundone, and the bolts let go, the plate fell down, and visible\r\ncommunication was established between the interior and the exterior.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan knelt by the glass. It was cloudy, seemingly opaque.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he exclaimed, “and the earth?”\r\n\r\n“The earth?” said Barbicane. “There it is.”\r\n\r\n“What! that little thread; that silver crescent?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, Michel. In four days, when the moon will be full, at the\r\nvery time we shall reach it, the earth will be new, and will only\r\nappear to us as a slender crescent which will soon disappear, and for\r\nsome days will be enveloped in utter darkness.”\r\n\r\n“That the earth?” repeated Michel Ardan, looking with all his eyes at\r\nthe thin slip of his native planet.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by President Barbicane was correct. The earth,\r\nwith respect to the projectile, was entering its last phase. It was in\r\nits octant, and showed a crescent finely traced on the dark background\r\nof the sky. Its light, rendered bluish by the thick strata of the\r\natmosphere was less intense than that of the crescent moon, but it was\r\nof considerable dimensions, and looked like an enormous arch stretched\r\nacross the firmament. Some parts brilliantly lighted, especially on its\r\nconcave part, showed the presence of high mountains, often disappearing\r\nbehind thick spots, which are never seen on the lunar disc. They were\r\nrings of clouds placed concentrically round the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nWhile the travelers were trying to pierce the profound darkness, a\r\nbrilliant cluster of shooting stars burst upon their eyes. Hundreds of\r\nmeteorites, ignited by the friction of the atmosphere, irradiated the\r\nshadow of the luminous train, and lined the cloudy parts of the disc\r\nwith their fire. At this period the earth was in its perihelion, and\r\nthe month of December is so propitious to these shooting stars, that\r\nastronomers have counted as many as twenty-four thousand in an hour.\r\nBut Michel Ardan, disdaining scientific reasonings, preferred thinking\r\nthat the earth was thus saluting the departure of her three children\r\nwith her most brilliant fireworks.\r\n\r\nIndeed this was all they saw of the globe lost in the solar world,\r\nrising and setting to the great planets like a simple morning or\r\nevening star! This globe, where they had left all their affections, was\r\nnothing more than a fugitive crescent!\r\n\r\nLong did the three friends look without speaking, though united in\r\nheart, while the projectile sped onward with an ever-decreasing speed.\r\nThen an irresistible drowsiness crept over their brain. Was it\r\nweariness of body and mind? No doubt; for after the over-excitement of\r\nthose last hours passed upon earth, reaction was inevitable.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Nicholl, “since we must sleep, let us sleep.”\r\n\r\nAnd stretching themselves on their couches, they were all three soon in\r\na profound slumber.\r\n\r\nBut they had not forgotten themselves more than a quarter of an hour,\r\nwhen Barbicane sat up suddenly, and rousing his companions with a loud\r\nvoice, exclaimed—\r\n\r\n“I have found it!”\r\n\r\n“What have you found?” asked Michel Ardan, jumping from his bed.\r\n\r\n“The reason why we did not hear the detonation of the Columbiad.”\r\n\r\n“And it is—?” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Because our projectile traveled faster than the sound!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nTHEIR PLACE OF SHELTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThis curious but certainly correct explanation once given, the three\r\nfriends returned to their slumbers. Could they have found a calmer or\r\nmore peaceful spot to sleep in? On the earth, houses, towns, cottages,\r\nand country feel every shock given to the exterior of the globe. On\r\nsea, the vessels rocked by the waves are still in motion; in the air,\r\nthe balloon oscillates incessantly on the fluid strata of divers\r\ndensities. This projectile alone, floating in perfect space, in the\r\nmidst of perfect silence, offered perfect repose.\r\n\r\nThus the sleep of our adventurous travelers might have been\r\nindefinitely prolonged, if an unexpected noise had not awakened them at\r\nabout seven o’clock in the morning of the 2nd of December, eight hours\r\nafter their departure.\r\n\r\nThis noise was a very natural barking.\r\n\r\n“The dogs! it is the dogs!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, rising at once.\r\n\r\n“They are hungry,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” replied Michel, “we have forgotten them.”\r\n\r\n“Where are they?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThey looked and found one of the animals crouched under the divan.\r\nTerrified and shaken by the initiatory shock, it had remained in the\r\ncorner till its voice returned with the pangs of hunger. It was the\r\namiable Diana, still very confused, who crept out of her retreat,\r\nthough not without much persuasion, Michel Ardan encouraging her with\r\nmost gracious words.\r\n\r\n“Come, Diana,” said he: “come, my girl! thou whose destiny will be\r\nmarked in the cynegetic annals; thou whom the pagans would have given\r\nas companion to the god Anubis, and Christians as friend to St. Roch;\r\nthou who art rushing into interplanetary space, and wilt perhaps be the\r\nEve of all Selenite dogs! come, Diana, come here.”\r\n\r\nDiana, flattered or not, advanced by degrees, uttering plaintive cries.\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Barbicane: “I see Eve, but where is Adam?”\r\n\r\n“Adam?” replied Michel; “Adam cannot be far off; he is there somewhere;\r\nwe must call him. Satellite! here, Satellite!”\r\n\r\nBut Satellite did not appear. Diana would not leave off howling. They\r\nfound, however, that she was not bruised, and they gave her a pie,\r\nwhich silenced her complaints. As to Satellite, he seemed quite lost.\r\nThey had to hunt a long time before finding him in one of the upper\r\ncompartments of the projectile, whither some unaccountable shock must\r\nhave violently hurled him. The poor beast, much hurt, was in a piteous\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n“The devil!” said Michel.\r\n\r\nThey brought the unfortunate dog down with great care. Its skull had\r\nbeen broken against the roof, and it seemed unlikely that he could\r\nrecover from such a shock. Meanwhile, he was stretched comfortably on a\r\ncushion. Once there, he heaved a sigh.\r\n\r\n“We will take care of you,” said Michel; “we are responsible for your\r\nexistence. I would rather lose an arm than a paw of my poor Satellite.”\r\n\r\nSaying which, he offered some water to the wounded dog, who swallowed\r\nit with avidity.\r\n\r\nThis attention paid, the travelers watched the earth and the moon\r\nattentively. The earth was now only discernible by a cloudy disc ending\r\nin a crescent, rather more contracted than that of the previous\r\nevening; but its expanse was still enormous, compared with that of the\r\nmoon, which was approaching nearer and nearer to a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” said Michel Ardan, “I am really sorry that we did not start\r\nwhen the earth was full, that is to say, when our globe was in\r\nopposition to the sun.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Because we should have seen our continents and seas in a new light—the\r\nfirst resplendent under the solar rays, the latter cloudy as\r\nrepresented on some maps of the world. I should like to have seen those\r\npoles of the earth on which the eye of man has never yet rested.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” replied Barbicane; “but if the earth had been _full_, the\r\nmoon would have been _new_; that is to say, invisible, because of the\r\nrays of the sun. It is better for us to see the destination we wish to\r\nreach, than the point of departure.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, Barbicane,” replied Captain Nicholl; “and, besides,\r\nwhen we have reached the moon, we shall have time during the long lunar\r\nnights to consider at our leisure the globe on which our likenesses\r\nswarm.”\r\n\r\n“Our likenesses!” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “They are no more our\r\nlikenesses than the Selenites are! We inhabit a new world, peopled by\r\nourselves—the projectile! I am Barbicane’s likeness, and Barbicane is\r\nNicholl’s. Beyond us, around us, human nature is at an end, and we are\r\nthe only population of this microcosm until we become pure Selenites.”\r\n\r\n“In about eighty-eight hours,” replied the captain.\r\n\r\n“Which means to say?” asked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“That it is half-past eight,” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” retorted Michel; “then it is impossible for me to find\r\neven the shadow of a reason why we should not go to breakfast.”\r\n\r\nIndeed the inhabitants of the new star could not live without eating,\r\nand their stomachs were suffering from the imperious laws of hunger.\r\nMichel Ardan, as a Frenchman, was declared chief cook, an important\r\nfunction, which raised no rival. The gas gave sufficient heat for the\r\nculinary apparatus, and the provision box furnished the elements of\r\nthis first feast.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast began with three bowls of excellent soup, thanks to the\r\nliquefaction in hot water of those precious cakes of Liebig, prepared\r\nfrom the best parts of the ruminants of the Pampas. To the soup\r\nsucceeded some beefsteaks, compressed by an hydraulic press, as tender\r\nand succulent as if brought straight from the kitchen of an English\r\neating-house. Michel, who was imaginative, maintained that they were\r\neven “red.”\r\n\r\nPreserved vegetables (“fresher than nature,” said the amiable Michel)\r\nsucceeded the dish of meat; and was followed by some cups of tea with\r\nbread and butter, after the American fashion.\r\n\r\nThe beverage was declared exquisite, and was due to the infusion of the\r\nchoicest leaves, of which the emperor of Russia had given some chests\r\nfor the benefit of the travelers.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, to crown the repast, Ardan had brought out a fine bottle of\r\nNuits, which was found “by chance” in the provision-box. The three\r\nfriends drank to the union of the earth and her satellite.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if he had not already done enough for the generous wine which\r\nhe had distilled on the slopes of Burgundy, the sun chose to be part of\r\nthe party. At this moment the projectile emerged from the conical\r\nshadow cast by the terrestrial globe, and the rays of the radiant orb\r\nstruck the lower disc of the projectile direct occasioned by the angle\r\nwhich the moon’s orbit makes with that of the earth.\r\n\r\n“The sun!” exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“No doubt,” replied Barbicane; “I expected it.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Michel, “the conical shadow which the earth leaves in space\r\nextends beyond the moon?”\r\n\r\n“Far beyond it, if the atmospheric refraction is not taken into\r\nconsideration,” said Barbicane. “But when the moon is enveloped in this\r\nshadow, it is because the centers of the three stars, the sun, the\r\nearth, and the moon, are all in one and the same straight line. Then\r\nthe _nodes_ coincide with the _phases_ of the moon, and there is an\r\neclipse. If we had started when there was an eclipse of the moon, all\r\nour passage would have been in the shadow, which would have been a\r\npity.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because, though we are floating in space, our projectile, bathed in\r\nthe solar rays, will receive light and heat. It economizes the gas,\r\nwhich is in every respect a good economy.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, under these rays which no atmosphere can temper, either in\r\ntemperature or brilliancy, the projectile grew warm and bright, as if\r\nit had passed suddenly from winter to summer. The moon above, the sun\r\nbeneath, were inundating it with their fire.\r\n\r\n“It is pleasant here,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“I should think so,” said Michel Ardan. “With a little earth spread on\r\nour aluminum planet we should have green peas in twenty-four hours. I\r\nhave but one fear, which is that the walls of the projectile might\r\nmelt.”\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself, my worthy friend,” replied Barbicane; “the projectile\r\nwithstood a very much higher temperature than this as it slid through\r\nthe strata of the atmosphere. I should not be surprised if it did not\r\nlook like a meteor on fire to the eyes of the spectators in Florida.”\r\n\r\n“But then J. T. Maston will think we are roasted!”\r\n\r\n“What astonishes me,” said Barbicane, “is that we have not been. That\r\nwas a danger we had not provided for.”\r\n\r\n“I feared it,” said Nicholl simply.\r\n\r\n“And you never mentioned it, my sublime captain,” exclaimed Michel\r\nArdan, clasping his friend’s hand.\r\n\r\nBarbicane now began to settle himself in the projectile as if he was\r\nnever to leave it. One must remember that this aerial car had a base\r\nwith a _superficies_ of fifty-four square feet. Its height to the roof\r\nwas twelve feet. Carefully laid out in the inside, and little\r\nencumbered by instruments and traveling utensils, which each had their\r\nparticular place, it left the three travelers a certain freedom of\r\nmovement. The thick window inserted in the bottom could bear any amount\r\nof weight, and Barbicane and his companions walked upon it as if it\r\nwere solid plank; but the sun striking it directly with its rays lit\r\nthe interior of the projectile from beneath, thus producing singular\r\neffects of light.\r\n\r\nThey began by investigating the state of their store of water and\r\nprovisions, neither of which had suffered, thanks to the care taken to\r\ndeaden the shock. Their provisions were abundant, and plentiful enough\r\nto last the three travelers for more than a year. Barbicane wished to\r\nbe cautious, in case the projectile should land on a part of the moon\r\nwhich was utterly barren. As to water and the reserve of brandy, which\r\nconsisted of fifty gallons, there was only enough for two months; but\r\naccording to the last observations of astronomers, the moon had a low,\r\ndense, and thick atmosphere, at least in the deep valleys, and there\r\nsprings and streams could not fail. Thus, during their passage, and for\r\nthe first year of their settlement on the lunar continent, these\r\nadventurous explorers would suffer neither hunger nor thirst.\r\n\r\nNow about the air in the projectile. There, too, they were secure.\r\nReiset and Regnaut’s apparatus, intended for the production of oxygen,\r\nwas supplied with chlorate of potassium for two months. They\r\nnecessarily consumed a certain quantity of gas, for they were obliged\r\nto keep the producing substance at a temperature of above 400°. But\r\nthere again they were all safe. The apparatus only wanted a little\r\ncare. But it was not enough to renew the oxygen; they must absorb the\r\ncarbonic acid produced by expiration. During the last twelve hours the\r\natmosphere of the projectile had become charged with this deleterious\r\ngas. Nicholl discovered the state of the air by observing Diana panting\r\npainfully. The carbonic acid, by a phenomenon similar to that produced\r\nin the famous Grotto del Cane, had collected at the bottom of the\r\nprojectile owing to its weight. Poor Diana, with her head low, would\r\nsuffer before her masters from the presence of this gas. But Captain\r\nNicholl hastened to remedy this state of things, by placing on the\r\nfloor several receivers containing caustic potash, which he shook about\r\nfor a time, and this substance, greedy of carbonic acid, soon\r\ncompletely absorbed it, thus purifying the air.\r\n\r\nAn inventory of instruments was then begun. The thermometers and\r\nbarometers had resisted, all but one minimum thermometer, the glass of\r\nwhich was broken. An excellent aneroid was drawn from the wadded box\r\nwhich contained it and hung on the wall. Of course it was only affected\r\nby and marked the pressure of the air inside the projectile, but it\r\nalso showed the quantity of moisture which it contained. At that moment\r\nits needle oscillated between 25.24 and 25.08.\r\n\r\nIt was fine weather.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had also brought several compasses, which he found intact.\r\nOne must understand that under present conditions their needles were\r\nacting _wildly_, that is without any _constant_ direction. Indeed, at\r\nthe distance they were from the earth, the magnetic pole could have no\r\nperceptible action upon the apparatus; but the box placed on the lunar\r\ndisc might perhaps exhibit some strange phenomena. In any case it would\r\nbe interesting to see whether the earth’s satellite submitted like\r\nherself to its magnetic influence.\r\n\r\nA hypsometer to measure the height of the lunar mountains, a sextant to\r\ntake the height of the sun, glasses which would be useful as they\r\nneared the moon, all these instruments were carefully looked over, and\r\npronounced good in spite of the violent shock.\r\n\r\nAs to the pickaxes and different tools which were Nicholl’s especial\r\nchoice; as to the sacks of different kinds of grain and shrubs which\r\nMichel Ardan hoped to transplant into Selenite ground, they were stowed\r\naway in the upper part of the projectile. There was a sort of granary\r\nthere, loaded with things which the extravagant Frenchman had heaped\r\nup. What they were no one knew, and the good-tempered fellow did not\r\nexplain. Now and then he climbed up by cramp-irons riveted to the\r\nwalls, but kept the inspection to himself. He arranged and rearranged,\r\nhe plunged his hand rapidly into certain mysterious boxes, singing in\r\none of the falsest of voices an old French refrain to enliven the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nBarbicane observed with some interest that his guns and other arms had\r\nnot been damaged. These were important, because, heavily loaded, they\r\nwere to help lessen the fall of the projectile, when drawn by the lunar\r\nattraction (after having passed the point of neutral attraction) on to\r\nthe moon’s surface; a fall which ought to be six times less rapid than\r\nit would have been on the earth’s surface, thanks to the difference of\r\nbulk. The inspection ended with general satisfaction, when each\r\nreturned to watch space through the side windows and the lower glass\r\ncoverlid.\r\n\r\nThere was the same view. The whole extent of the celestial sphere\r\nswarmed with stars and constellations of wonderful purity, enough to\r\ndrive an astronomer out of his mind! On one side the sun, like the\r\nmouth of a lighted oven, a dazzling disc without a halo, standing out\r\non the dark background of the sky! On the other, the moon returning its\r\nfire by reflection, and apparently motionless in the midst of the\r\nstarry world. Then, a large spot seemingly nailed to the firmament,\r\nbordered by a silvery cord; it was the earth! Here and there nebulous\r\nmasses like large flakes of starry snow; and from the zenith to the\r\nnadir, an immense ring formed by an impalpable dust of stars, the\r\n“Milky Way,” in the midst of which the sun ranks only as a star of the\r\nfourth magnitude. The observers could not take their eyes from this\r\nnovel spectacle, of which no description could give an adequate idea.\r\nWhat reflections it suggested! What emotions hitherto unknown awoke in\r\ntheir souls! Barbicane wished to begin the relation of his journey\r\nwhile under its first impressions, and hour after hour took notes of\r\nall facts happening in the beginning of the enterprise. He wrote\r\nquietly, with his large square writing, in a business-like style.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Nicholl, the calculator, looked over the minutes of\r\ntheir passage, and worked out figures with unparalleled dexterity.\r\nMichel Ardan chatted first with Barbicane, who did not answer him, and\r\nthen with Nicholl, who did not hear him, with Diana, who understood\r\nnone of his theories, and lastly with himself, questioning and\r\nanswering, going and coming, busy with a thousand details; at one time\r\nbent over the lower glass, at another roosting in the heights of the\r\nprojectile, and always singing. In this microcosm he represented French\r\nloquacity and excitability, and we beg you to believe that they were\r\nwell represented. The day, or rather (for the expression is not\r\ncorrect) the lapse of twelve hours, which forms a day upon the earth,\r\nclosed with a plentiful supper carefully prepared. No accident of any\r\nnature had yet happened to shake the travelers’ confidence; so, full of\r\nhope, already sure of success, they slept peacefully, while the\r\nprojectile under an uniformly decreasing speed was crossing the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nA LITTLE ALGEBRA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed without incident. The word “night,” however, is\r\nscarcely applicable.\r\n\r\nThe position of the projectile with regard to the sun did not change.\r\nAstronomically, it was daylight on the lower part, and night on the\r\nupper; so when during this narrative these words are used, they\r\nrepresent the lapse of time between rising and setting of the sun upon\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe travelers’ sleep was rendered more peaceful by the projectile’s\r\nexcessive speed, for it seemed absolutely motionless. Not a motion\r\nbetrayed its onward course through space. The rate of progress, however\r\nrapid it might be, cannot produce any sensible effect on the human\r\nframe when it takes place in a vacuum, or when the mass of air\r\ncirculates with the body which is carried with it. What inhabitant of\r\nthe earth perceives its speed, which, however, is at the rate of 68,000\r\nmiles per hour? Motion under such conditions is “felt” no more than\r\nrepose; and when a body is in repose it will remain so as long as no\r\nstrange force displaces it; if moving, it will not stop unless an\r\nobstacle comes in its way. This indifference to motion or repose is\r\ncalled inertia.\r\n\r\nBarbicane and his companions might have believed themselves perfectly\r\nstationary, being shut up in the projectile; indeed, the effect would\r\nhave been the same if they had been on the outside of it. Had it not\r\nbeen for the moon, which was increasing above them, they might have\r\nsworn that they were floating in complete stagnation.\r\n\r\nThat morning, the 3rd of December, the travelers were awakened by a\r\njoyous but unexpected noise; it was the crowing of a cock which sounded\r\nthrough the car. Michel Ardan, who was the first on his feet, climbed\r\nto the top of the projectile, and shutting a box, the lid of which was\r\npartly open, said in a low voice, “Will you hold your tongue? That\r\ncreature will spoil my design!”\r\n\r\nBut Nicholl and Barbicane were awake.\r\n\r\n“A cock!” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Why no, my friends,” Michel answered quickly; “it was I who wished to\r\nawake you by this rural sound.” So saying, he gave vent to a splendid\r\ncock-a-doodledoo, which would have done honor to the proudest of\r\npoultry-yards.\r\n\r\nThe two Americans could not help laughing.\r\n\r\n“Fine talent that,” said Nicholl, looking suspiciously at his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Michel; “a joke in my country. It is very Gallic; they play\r\nthe cock so in the best society.”\r\n\r\nThen turning the conversation:\r\n\r\n“Barbicane, do you know what I have been thinking of all night?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered the president.\r\n\r\n“Of our Cambridge friends. You have already remarked that I am an\r\nignoramus in mathematical subjects; and it is impossible for me to find\r\nout how the savants of the observatory were able to calculate what\r\ninitiatory speed the projectile ought to have on leaving the Columbiad\r\nin order to attain the moon.”\r\n\r\n“You mean to say,” replied Barbicane, “to attain that neutral point\r\nwhere the terrestrial and lunar attractions are equal; for, starting\r\nfrom that point, situated about nine-tenths of the distance traveled\r\nover, the projectile would simply fall upon the moon, on account of its\r\nweight.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” said Michel; “but, once more; how could they calculate the\r\ninitiatory speed?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing can be easier,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“And you knew how to make that calculation?” asked Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly. Nicholl and I would have made it, if the observatory had\r\nnot saved us the trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, old Barbicane,” replied Michel; “they might have cut off my\r\nhead, beginning at my feet, before they could have made me solve that\r\nproblem.”\r\n\r\n“Because you do not know algebra,” answered Barbicane quietly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, there you are, you eaters of _x_1; you think you have said all\r\nwhen you have said ‘Algebra.’”\r\n\r\n“Michel,” said Barbicane, “can you use a forge without a hammer, or a\r\nplow without a plowshare?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, algebra is a tool, like the plow or the hammer, and a good tool\r\nto those who know how to use it.”\r\n\r\n“Seriously?”\r\n\r\n“Quite seriously.”\r\n\r\n“And can you use that tool in my presence?”\r\n\r\n“If it will interest you.”\r\n\r\n“And show me how they calculated the initiatory speed of our car?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my worthy friend; taking into consideration all the elements of\r\nthe problem, the distance from the center of the earth to the center of\r\nthe moon, of the radius of the earth, of its bulk, and of the bulk of\r\nthe moon, I can tell exactly what ought to be the initiatory speed of\r\nthe projectile, and that by a simple formula.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see.”\r\n\r\n“You shall see it; only I shall not give you the real course drawn by\r\nthe projectile between the moon and the earth in considering their\r\nmotion round the sun. No, I shall consider these two orbs as perfectly\r\nmotionless, which will answer all our purpose.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“Because it will be trying to solve the problem called ‘the problem of\r\nthe three bodies,’ for which the integral calculus is not yet far\r\nenough advanced.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Michel Ardan, in his sly tone, “mathematics have not said\r\ntheir last word?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps the Selenites have carried the integral calculus farther\r\nthan you have; and, by the bye, what is this ‘integral calculus?’”\r\n\r\n“It is a calculation the converse of the differential,” replied\r\nBarbicane seriously.\r\n\r\n“Much obliged; it is all very clear, no doubt.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued Barbicane, “a slip of paper and a bit of pencil,\r\nand before a half-hour is over I will have found the required formula.”\r\n\r\nHalf an hour had not elapsed before Barbicane, raising his head, showed\r\nMichel Ardan a page covered with algebraical signs, in which the\r\ngeneral formula for the solution was contained.\r\n\r\n“Well, and does Nicholl understand what that means?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, Michel,” replied the captain. “All these signs, which seem\r\ncabalistic to you, form the plainest, the clearest, and the most\r\nlogical language to those who know how to read it.”\r\n\r\n“And you pretend, Nicholl,” asked Michel, “that by means of these\r\nhieroglyphics, more incomprehensible than the Egyptian Ibis, you can\r\nfind what initiatory speed it was necessary to give the projectile?”\r\n\r\n“Incontestably,” replied Nicholl; “and even by this same formula I can\r\nalways tell you its speed at any point of its transit.”\r\n\r\n“On your word?”\r\n\r\n“On my word.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are as cunning as our president.”\r\n\r\n“No, Michel; the difficult part is what Barbicane has done; that is, to\r\nget an equation which shall satisfy all the conditions of the problem.\r\nThe remainder is only a question of arithmetic, requiring merely the\r\nknowledge of the four rules.”\r\n\r\n“That is something!” replied Michel Ardan, who for his life could not\r\ndo addition right, and who defined the rule as a Chinese puzzle, which\r\nallowed one to obtain all sorts of totals.\r\n\r\n“The expression _v_ zero, which you see in that equation, is the speed\r\nwhich the projectile will have on leaving the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Nicholl; “it is from that point that we must calculate\r\nthe velocity, since we know already that the velocity at departure was\r\nexactly one and a half times more than on leaving the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“I understand no more,” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“It is a very simple calculation,” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Not as simple as I am,” retorted Michel.\r\n\r\n“That means, that when our projectile reached the limits of the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere it had already lost one-third of its initiatory\r\nspeed.”\r\n\r\n“As much as that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend; merely by friction against the atmospheric strata. You\r\nunderstand that the faster it goes the more resistance it meets with\r\nfrom the air.”\r\n\r\n“That I admit,” answered Michel; “and I understand it, although your\r\nx’s and zero’s, and algebraic formula, are rattling in my head like\r\nnails in a bag.”\r\n\r\n“First effects of algebra,” replied Barbicane; “and now, to finish, we\r\nare going to prove the given number of these different expressions,\r\nthat is, work out their value.”\r\n\r\n“Finish me!” replied Michel.\r\n\r\nBarbicane took the paper, and began to make his calculations with great\r\nrapidity. Nicholl looked over and greedily read the work as it\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\n“That’s it! that’s it!” at last he cried.\r\n\r\n“Is it clear?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“It is written in letters of fire,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful fellows!” muttered Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand it at last?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Do I understand it?” cried Ardan; “my head is splitting with it.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Nicholl, “to find out the speed of the projectile when\r\nit leaves the atmosphere, we have only to calculate that.”\r\n\r\nThe captain, as a practical man equal to all difficulties, began to\r\nwrite with frightful rapidity. Divisions and multiplications grew under\r\nhis fingers; the figures were like hail on the white page. Barbicane\r\nwatched him, while Michel Ardan nursed a growing headache with both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“Very well?” asked Barbicane, after some minutes’ silence.\r\n\r\n“Well!” replied Nicholl; every calculation made, _v_ zero, that is to\r\nsay, the speed necessary for the projectile on leaving the atmosphere,\r\nto enable it to reach the equal point of attraction, ought to be—”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Twelve thousand yards.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Barbicane, starting; “you say—”\r\n\r\n“Twelve thousand yards.”\r\n\r\n“The devil!” cried the president, making a gesture of despair.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Michel Ardan, much surprised.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter! why, if at this moment our speed had already\r\ndiminished one-third by friction, the initiatory speed ought to have\r\nbeen—”\r\n\r\n“Seventeen thousand yards.”\r\n\r\n“And the Cambridge Observatory declared that twelve thousand yards was\r\nenough at starting; and our projectile, which only started with that\r\nspeed—”\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Well, it will not be enough.”\r\n\r\n“Good.”\r\n\r\n“We shall not be able to reach the neutral point.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!”\r\n\r\n“We shall not even get halfway.”\r\n\r\n“In the name of the projectile!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, jumping as if\r\nit was already on the point of striking the terrestrial globe.\r\n\r\n“And we shall fall back upon the earth!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nTHE COLD OF SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis revelation came like a thunderbolt. Who could have expected such\r\nan error in calculation? Barbicane would not believe it. Nicholl\r\nrevised his figures: they were exact. As to the formula which had\r\ndetermined them, they could not suspect its truth; it was evident that\r\nan initiatory velocity of seventeen thousand yards in the first second\r\nwas necessary to enable them to reach the neutral point.\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked at each other silently. There was no thought\r\nof breakfast. Barbicane, with clenched teeth, knitted brows, and hands\r\nclasped convulsively, was watching through the window. Nicholl had\r\ncrossed his arms, and was examining his calculations. Michel Ardan was\r\nmuttering:\r\n\r\n“That is just like these scientific men: they never do anything else. I\r\nwould give twenty pistoles if we could fall upon the Cambridge\r\nObservatory and crush it, together with the whole lot of dabblers in\r\nfigures which it contains.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a thought struck the captain, which he at once communicated to\r\nBarbicane.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said he; “it is seven o’clock in the morning; we have already\r\nbeen gone thirty-two hours; more than half our passage is over, and we\r\nare not falling that I am aware of.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane did not answer, but after a rapid glance at the captain, took\r\na pair of compasses wherewith to measure the angular distance of the\r\nterrestrial globe; then from the lower window he took an exact\r\nobservation, and noticed that the projectile was apparently stationary.\r\nThen rising and wiping his forehead, on which large drops of\r\nperspiration were standing, he put some figures on paper. Nicholl\r\nunderstood that the president was deducting from the terrestrial\r\ndiameter the projectile’s distance from the earth. He watched him\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n“No,” exclaimed Barbicane, after some moments, “no, we are not falling!\r\nno, we are already more than 50,000 leagues from the earth. We have\r\npassed the point at which the projectile would have stopped if its\r\nspeed had only been 12,000 yards at starting. We are still going up.”\r\n\r\n“That is evident,” replied Nicholl; “and we must conclude that our\r\ninitial speed, under the power of the 400,000 pounds of gun-cotton,\r\nmust have exceeded the required 12,000 yards. Now I can understand how,\r\nafter thirteen minutes only, we met the second satellite, which\r\ngravitates round the earth at more than 2,000 leagues’ distance.”\r\n\r\n“And this explanation is the more probable,” added Barbicane, “Because,\r\nin throwing off the water enclosed between its partition-breaks, the\r\nprojectile found itself lightened of a considerable weight.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my brave Nicholl, we are saved!”\r\n\r\n“Very well then,” said Michel Ardan quietly; “as we are safe, let us\r\nhave breakfast.”\r\n\r\nNicholl was not mistaken. The initial speed had been, very fortunately,\r\nmuch above that estimated by the Cambridge Observatory; but the\r\nCambridge Observatory had nevertheless made a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe travelers, recovered from this false alarm, breakfasted merrily. If\r\nthey ate a good deal, they talked more. Their confidence was greater\r\nafter than before “the incident of the algebra.”\r\n\r\n“Why should we not succeed?” said Michel Ardan; “why should we not\r\narrive safely? We are launched; we have no obstacle before us, no\r\nstones in the way; the road is open, more so than that of a ship\r\nbattling with the sea; more open than that of a balloon battling with\r\nthe wind; and if a ship can reach its destination, a balloon go where\r\nit pleases, why cannot our projectile attain its end and aim?”\r\n\r\n“It _will_ attain it,” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“If only to do honor to the Americans,” added Michel Ardan, “the only\r\npeople who could bring such an enterprise to a happy termination, and\r\nthe only one which could produce a President Barbicane. Ah, now we are\r\nno longer uneasy, I begin to think, What will become of us? We shall\r\nget right royally weary.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl made a gesture of denial.\r\n\r\n“But I have provided for the contingency, my friends,” replied Michel;\r\n“you have only to speak, and I have chess, draughts, cards, and\r\ndominoes at your disposal; nothing is wanting but a billiard-table.”\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Barbicane; “you brought away such trifles?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Michel, “and not only to distract ourselves, but\r\nalso with the laudable intention of endowing the Selenite smoking\r\ndivans with them.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Barbicane, “if the moon is inhabited, its inhabitants\r\nmust have appeared some thousands of years before those of the earth,\r\nfor we cannot doubt that their star is much older than ours. If then\r\nthese Selenites have existed their hundreds of thousands of years, and\r\nif their brain is of the same organization of the human brain, they\r\nhave already invented all that we have invented, and even what we may\r\ninvent in future ages. They have nothing to learn from _us_, and we\r\nhave everything to learn from _them_.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said Michel; “you believe that they have artists like Phidias,\r\nMichael Angelo, or Raphael?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Poets like Homer, Virgil, Milton, Lamartine, and Hugo?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“Philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant?”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt of it.”\r\n\r\n“Scientific men like Archimedes, Euclid, Pascal, Newton?”\r\n\r\n“I could swear it.”\r\n\r\n“Comic writers like Arnal, and photographers like—like Nadar?”\r\n\r\n“Certain.”\r\n\r\n“Then, friend Barbicane, if they are as strong as we are, and even\r\nstronger—these Selenites—why have they not tried to communicate with\r\nthe earth? why have they not launched a lunar projectile to our\r\nterrestrial regions?”\r\n\r\n“Who told you that they have never done so?” said Barbicane seriously.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” added Nicholl, “it would be easier for them than for us, for\r\ntwo reasons; first, because the attraction on the moon’s surface is six\r\ntimes less than on that of the earth, which would allow a projectile to\r\nrise more easily; secondly, because it would be enough to send such a\r\nprojectile only at 8,000 leagues instead of 80,000, which would require\r\nthe force of projection to be ten times less strong.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Michel, “I repeat it, why have they not done it?”\r\n\r\n“And I repeat,” said Barbicane; “who told you that they have not done\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“Thousands of years before man appeared on earth.”\r\n\r\n“And the projectile—where is the projectile? I demand to see the\r\nprojectile.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied Barbicane, “the sea covers five-sixths of our\r\nglobe. From that we may draw five good reasons for supposing that the\r\nlunar projectile, if ever launched, is now at the bottom of the\r\nAtlantic or the Pacific, unless it sped into some crevasse at that\r\nperiod when the crust of the earth was not yet hardened.”\r\n\r\n“Old Barbicane,” said Michel, “you have an answer for everything, and I\r\nbow before your wisdom. But there is one hypothesis that would suit me\r\nbetter than all the others, which is, the Selenites, being older than\r\nwe, are wiser, and have not invented gunpowder.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Diana joined in the conversation by a sonorous barking.\r\nShe was asking for her breakfast.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Michel Ardan, “in our discussion we have forgotten Diana and\r\nSatellite.”\r\n\r\nImmediately a good-sized pie was given to the dog, which devoured it\r\nhungrily.\r\n\r\n“Do you see, Barbicane,” said Michel, “we should have made a second\r\nNoah’s ark of this projectile, and borne with us to the moon a couple\r\nof every kind of domestic animal.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say; but room would have failed us.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Michel, “we might have squeezed a little.”\r\n\r\n“The fact is,” replied Nicholl, “that cows, bulls, and horses, and all\r\nruminants, would have been very useful on the lunar continent, but\r\nunfortunately the car could neither have been made a stable nor a\r\nshed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we might have at least brought a donkey, only a little donkey;\r\nthat courageous beast which old Silenus loved to mount. I love those\r\nold donkeys; they are the least favored animals in creation; they are\r\nnot only beaten while alive, but even after they are dead.”\r\n\r\n“How do you make that out?” asked Barbicane. “Why,” said Michel, “they\r\nmake their skins into drums.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at this ridiculous\r\nremark. But a cry from their merry companion stopped them. The latter\r\nwas leaning over the spot where Satellite lay. He rose, saying:\r\n\r\n“My good Satellite is no longer ill.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Michel, “he is dead! There,” added he, in a piteous\r\ntone, “that is embarrassing. I much fear, my poor Diana, that you will\r\nleave no progeny in the lunar regions!”\r\n\r\nIndeed the unfortunate Satellite had not survived its wound. It was\r\nquite dead. Michel Ardan looked at his friends with a rueful\r\ncountenance.\r\n\r\n“One question presents itself,” said Barbicane. “We cannot keep the\r\ndead body of this dog with us for the next forty-eight hours.”\r\n\r\n“No! certainly not,” replied Nicholl; “but our scuttles are fixed on\r\nhinges; they can be let down. We will open one, and throw the body out\r\ninto space.”\r\n\r\nThe president thought for some moments, and then said:\r\n\r\n“Yes, we must do so, but at the same time taking very great\r\nprecautions.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“For two reasons which you will understand,” answered Barbicane. “The\r\nfirst relates to the air shut up in the projectile, and of which we\r\nmust lose as little as possible.”\r\n\r\n“But we manufacture the air?”\r\n\r\n“Only in part. We make only the oxygen, my worthy Michel; and with\r\nregard to that, we must watch that the apparatus does not furnish the\r\noxygen in too great a quantity; for an excess would bring us very\r\nserious physiological troubles. But if we make the oxygen, we do not\r\nmake the azote, that medium which the lungs do not absorb, and which\r\nought to remain intact; and that azote will escape rapidly through the\r\nopen scuttles.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! the time for throwing out poor Satellite?” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“Agreed; but we must act quickly.”\r\n\r\n“And the second reason?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“The second reason is that we must not let the outer cold, which is\r\nexcessive, penetrate the projectile or we shall be frozen to death.”\r\n\r\n“But the sun?”\r\n\r\n“The sun warms our projectile, which absorbs its rays; but it does not\r\nwarm the vacuum in which we are floating at this moment. Where there is\r\nno air, there is no more heat than diffused light; and the same with\r\ndarkness; it is cold where the sun’s rays do not strike direct. This\r\ntemperature is only the temperature produced by the radiation of the\r\nstars; that is to say, what the terrestrial globe would undergo if the\r\nsun disappeared one day.”\r\n\r\n“Which is not to be feared,” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Who knows?” said Michel Ardan. “But, in admitting that the sun does\r\nnot go out, might it not happen that the earth might move away from\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“There!” said Barbicane, “there is Michel with his ideas.”\r\n\r\n“And,” continued Michel, “do we not know that in 1861 the earth passed\r\nthrough the tail of a comet? Or let us suppose a comet whose power of\r\nattraction is greater than that of the sun. The terrestrial orbit will\r\nbend toward the wandering star, and the earth, becoming its satellite,\r\nwill be drawn such a distance that the rays of the sun will have no\r\naction on its surface.”\r\n\r\n“That _might_ happen, indeed,” replied Barbicane, “but the consequences\r\nof such a displacement need not be so formidable as you suppose.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because the heat and cold would be equalized on our globe. It has been\r\ncalculated that, had our earth been carried along in its course by the\r\ncomet of 1861, at its perihelion, that is, its nearest approach to the\r\nsun, it would have undergone a heat 28,000 times greater than that of\r\nsummer. But this heat, which is sufficient to evaporate the waters,\r\nwould have formed a thick ring of cloud, which would have modified that\r\nexcessive temperature; hence the compensation between the cold of the\r\naphelion and the heat of the perihelion.”\r\n\r\n“At how many degrees,” asked Nicholl, “is the temperature of the\r\nplanetary spaces estimated?”\r\n\r\n“Formerly,” replied Barbicane, “it was greatly exagerated; but now,\r\nafter the calculations of Fourier, of the French Academy of Science, it\r\nis not supposed to exceed 60° Centigrade below zero.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Michel, “that’s nothing!”\r\n\r\n“It is very much,” replied Barbicane; “the temperature which was\r\nobserved in the polar regions, at Melville Island and Fort Reliance,\r\nthat is 76° Fahrenheit below zero.”\r\n\r\n“If I mistake not,” said Nicholl, “M. Pouillet, another savant,\r\nestimates the temperature of space at 250° Fahrenheit below zero. We\r\nshall, however, be able to verify these calculations for ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Not at present; because the solar rays, beating directly upon our\r\nthermometer, would give, on the contrary, a very high temperature. But,\r\nwhen we arrive in the moon, during its fifteen days of night at either\r\nface, we shall have leisure to make the experiment, for our satellite\r\nlies in a vacuum.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by a vacuum?” asked Michel. “Is it perfectly such?”\r\n\r\n“It is absolutely void of air.”\r\n\r\n“And is the air replaced by nothing whatever?”\r\n\r\n“By the ether only,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“And pray what is the ether?”\r\n\r\n“The ether, my friend, is an agglomeration of imponderable atoms,\r\nwhich, relatively to their dimensions, are as far removed from each\r\nother as the celestial bodies are in space. It is these atoms which, by\r\ntheir vibratory motion, produce both light and heat in the universe.”\r\n\r\nThey now proceeded to the burial of Satellite. They had merely to drop\r\nhim into space, in the same way that sailors drop a body into the sea;\r\nbut, as President Barbicane suggested, they must act quickly, so as to\r\nlose as little as possible of that air whose elasticity would rapidly\r\nhave spread it into space. The bolts of the right scuttle, the opening\r\nof which measured about twelve inches across, were carefully drawn,\r\nwhile Michel, quite grieved, prepared to launch his dog into space. The\r\nglass, raised by a powerful lever, which enabled it to overcome the\r\npressure of the inside air on the walls of the projectile, turned\r\nrapidly on its hinges, and Satellite was thrown out. Scarcely a\r\nparticle of air could have escaped, and the operation was so successful\r\nthat later on Barbicane did not fear to dispose of the rubbish which\r\nencumbered the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of December, when the travelers awoke after fifty-four\r\nhours’ journey, the chronometer marked five o’clock of the terrestrial\r\nmorning. In time it was just over five hours and forty minutes, half of\r\nthat assigned to their sojourn in the projectile; but they had already\r\naccomplished nearly seven-tenths of the way. This peculiarity was due\r\nto their regularly decreasing speed.\r\n\r\nNow when they observed the earth through the lower window, it looked\r\nlike nothing more than a dark spot, drowned in the solar rays. No more\r\ncrescent, no more cloudy light! The next day, at midnight, the earth\r\nwould be _new_, at the very moment when the moon would be full. Above,\r\nthe orb of night was nearing the line followed by the projectile, so as\r\nto meet it at the given hour. All around the black vault was studded\r\nwith brilliant points, which seemed to move slowly; but, at the great\r\ndistance they were from them, their relative size did not seem to\r\nchange. The sun and stars appeared exactly as they do to us upon earth.\r\nAs to the moon, she was considerably larger; but the travelers’\r\nglasses, not very powerful, did not allow them as yet to make any\r\nuseful observations upon her surface, or reconnoiter her\r\ntopographically or geologically.\r\n\r\nThus the time passed in never-ending conversations all about the moon.\r\nEach one brought forward his own contingent of particular facts;\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl always serious, Michel Ardan always enthusiastic.\r\nThe projectile, its situation, its direction, incidents which might\r\nhappen, the precautions necessitated by their fall on to the moon, were\r\ninexhaustible matters of conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs they were breakfasting, a question of Michel’s, relating to the\r\nprojectile, provoked rather a curious answer from Barbicane, which is\r\nworth repeating. Michel, supposing it to be roughly stopped, while\r\nstill under its formidable initial speed, wished to know what the\r\nconsequences of the stoppage would have been.\r\n\r\n“But,” said Barbicane, “I do not see how it could have been stopped.”\r\n\r\n“But let us suppose so,” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“It is an impossible supposition,” said the practical Barbicane;\r\n“unless that impulsive force had failed; but even then its speed would\r\ndiminish by degrees, and it would not have stopped suddenly.”\r\n\r\n“Admit that it had struck a body in space.”\r\n\r\n“What body?”\r\n\r\n“Why that enormous meteor which we met.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Nicholl, “the projectile would have been broken into a\r\nthousand pieces, and we with it.”\r\n\r\n“More than that,” replied Barbicane; “we should have been burned to\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n“Burned?” exclaimed Michel, “by Jove! I am sorry it did not happen,\r\n‘just to see.’”\r\n\r\n“And you would have seen,” replied Barbicane. “It is known now that\r\nheat is only a modification of motion. When water is warmed—that is to\r\nsay, when heat is added to it—its particles are set in motion.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Michel, “that is an ingenious theory!”\r\n\r\n“And a true one, my worthy friend; for it explains every phenomenon of\r\ncaloric. Heat is but the motion of atoms, a simple oscillation of the\r\nparticles of a body. When they apply the brake to a train, the train\r\ncomes to a stop; but what becomes of the motion which it had previously\r\npossessed? It is transformed into heat, and the brake becomes hot. Why\r\ndo they grease the axles of the wheels? To prevent their heating,\r\nbecause this heat would be generated by the motion which is thus lost\r\nby transformation.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand,” replied Michel, “perfectly. For example, when I\r\nhave run a long time, when I am swimming, when I am perspiring in large\r\ndrops, why am I obliged to stop? Simply because my motion is changed\r\ninto heat.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane could not help smiling at Michel’s reply; then, returning to\r\nhis theory, said:\r\n\r\n“Thus, in case of a shock, it would have been with our projectile as\r\nwith a ball which falls in a burning state after having struck the\r\nmetal plate; it is its motion which is turned into heat. Consequently I\r\naffirm that, if our projectile had struck the meteor, its speed thus\r\nsuddenly checked would have raised a heat great enough to turn it into\r\nvapor instantaneously.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” asked Nicholl, “what would happen if the earth’s motion were to\r\nstop suddenly?”\r\n\r\n“Her temperature would be raised to such a pitch,” said Barbicane,\r\n“that she would be at once reduced to vapor.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Michel, “that is a way of ending the earth which will\r\ngreatly simplify things.”\r\n\r\n“And if the earth fell upon the sun?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“According to calculation,” replied Barbicane, “the fall would develop\r\na heat equal to that produced by 16,000 globes of coal, each equal in\r\nbulk to our terrestrial globe.”\r\n\r\n“Good additional heat for the sun,” replied Michel Ardan, “of which the\r\ninhabitants of Uranus or Neptune would doubtless not complain; they\r\nmust be perished with cold on their planets.”\r\n\r\n“Thus, my friends,” said Barbicane, “all motion suddenly stopped\r\nproduces heat. And this theory allows us to infer that the heat of the\r\nsolar disc is fed by a hail of meteors falling incessantly on its\r\nsurface. They have even calculated—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” murmured Michel, “the figures are coming.”\r\n\r\n“They have even calculated,” continued the imperturbable Barbicane,\r\n“that the shock of each meteor on the sun ought to produce a heat equal\r\nto that of 4,000 masses of coal of an equal bulk.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the solar heat?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“It is equal to that produced by the combustion of a stratum of coal\r\nsurrounding the sun to a depth of forty-seven miles.”\r\n\r\n“And that heat—”\r\n\r\n“Would be able to boil two billions nine hundred millions of cubic\r\nmyriameters[2] of water.”\r\n\r\n [2] The myriameter is equal to rather more than 10,936 cubic yards\r\n English.\r\n\r\n\r\n“And it does not roast us!” exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Barbicane, “because the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs\r\nfour-tenths of the solar heat; besides, the quantity of heat\r\nintercepted by the earth is but a billionth part of the entire\r\nradiation.”\r\n\r\n“I see that all is for the best,” said Michel, “and that this\r\natmosphere is a useful invention; for it not only allows us to breathe,\r\nbut it prevents us from roasting.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Nicholl, “unfortunately, it will not be the same in the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said Michel, always hopeful. “If there are inhabitants, they\r\nmust breathe. If there are no longer any, they must have left enough\r\noxygen for three people, if only at the bottom of ravines, where its\r\nown weight will cause it to accumulate, and we will not climb the\r\nmountains; that is all.” And Michel, rising, went to look at the lunar\r\ndisc, which shone with intolerable brilliancy.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” said he, “it must be hot up there!”\r\n\r\n“Without considering,” replied Nicholl, “that the day lasts 360 hours!”\r\n\r\n“And to compensate that,” said Barbicane, “the nights have the same\r\nlength; and as heat is restored by radiation, their temperature can\r\nonly be that of the planetary space.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty country, that!” exclaimed Michel. “Never mind! I wish I was\r\nthere! Ah! my dear comrades, it will be rather curious to have the\r\nearth for our moon, to see it rise on the horizon, to recognize the\r\nshape of its continents, and to say to oneself, ‘There is America,\r\nthere is Europe;’ then to follow it when it is about to lose itself in\r\nthe sun’s rays! By the bye, Barbicane, have the Selenites eclipses?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, eclipses of the sun,” replied Barbicane, “when the centers of the\r\nthree orbs are on a line, the earth being in the middle. But they are\r\nonly partial, during which the earth, cast like a screen upon the solar\r\ndisc, allows the greater portion to be seen.”\r\n\r\n“And why,” asked Nicholl, “is there no total eclipse? Does not the cone\r\nof the shadow cast by the earth extend beyond the moon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if we do not take into consideration the refraction produced by\r\nthe terrestrial atmosphere. No, if we take that refraction into\r\nconsideration. Thus let <lower case delta> be the horizontal parallel,\r\nand _p_ the apparent semidiameter—”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Michel. “Do speak plainly, you man of algebra!”\r\n\r\n“Very well, replied Barbicane; “in popular language the mean distance\r\nfrom the moon to the earth being sixty terrestrial radii, the length of\r\nthe cone of the shadow, on account of refraction, is reduced to less\r\nthan forty-two radii. The result is that when there are eclipses, the\r\nmoon finds itself beyond the cone of pure shadow, and that the sun\r\nsends her its rays, not only from its edges, but also from its center.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Michel, in a merry tone, “why are there eclipses, when\r\nthere ought not to be any?”\r\n\r\n“Simply because the solar rays are weakened by this refraction, and the\r\natmosphere through which they pass extinguished the greater part of\r\nthem!”\r\n\r\n“That reason satisfies me,” replied Michel. “Besides we shall see when\r\nwe get there. Now, tell me, Barbicane, do you believe that the moon is\r\nan old comet?”\r\n\r\n“There’s an idea!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Michel, with an amiable swagger, “I have a few ideas of\r\nthat sort.”\r\n\r\n“But that idea does not spring from Michel,” answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I am a plagiarist.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt about it. According to the ancients, the Arcadians pretend\r\nthat their ancestors inhabited the earth before the moon became her\r\nsatellite. Starting from this fact, some scientific men have seen in\r\nthe moon a comet whose orbit will one day bring it so near to the earth\r\nthat it will be held there by its attraction.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any truth in this hypothesis?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” said Barbicane, “and the proof is, that the moon has\r\npreserved no trace of the gaseous envelope which always accompanies\r\ncomets.”\r\n\r\n“But,” continued Nicholl, “Before becoming the earth’s satellite, could\r\nnot the moon, when in her perihelion, pass so near the sun as by\r\nevaporation to get rid of all those gaseous substances?”\r\n\r\n“It is possible, friend Nicholl, but not probable.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because—Faith I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Michel, “what hundred of volumes we might make of all\r\nthat we do not know!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! indeed. What time is it?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Three o’clock,” answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“How time goes,” said Michel, “in the conversation of scientific men\r\nsuch as we are! Certainly, I feel I know too much! I feel that I am\r\nbecoming a well!”\r\n\r\nSaying which, Michel hoisted himself to the roof of the projectile, “to\r\nobserve the moon better,” he pretended. During this time his companions\r\nwere watching through the lower glass. Nothing new to note!\r\n\r\nWhen Michel Ardan came down, he went to the side scuttle; and suddenly\r\nthey heard an exclamation of surprise!\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThe president approached the window, and saw a sort of flattened sack\r\nfloating some yards from the projectile. This object seemed as\r\nmotionless as the projectile, and was consequently animated with the\r\nsame ascending movement.\r\n\r\n“What is that machine?” continued Michel Ardan. “Is it one of the\r\nbodies which our projectile keeps within its attraction, and which will\r\naccompany it to the moon?”\r\n\r\n“What astonishes me,” said Nicholl, “is that the specific weight of the\r\nbody, which is certainly less than that of the projectile, allows it to\r\nkeep so perfectly on a level with it.”\r\n\r\n“Nicholl,” replied Barbicane, after a moment’s reflection, “I do not\r\nknow what the object it, but I do know why it maintains our level.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“Because we are floating in space, my dear captain, and in space bodies\r\nfall or move (which is the same thing) with equal speed whatever be\r\ntheir weight or form; it is the air, which by its resistance creates\r\nthese differences in weight. When you create a vacuum in a tube, the\r\nobjects you send through it, grains of dust or grains of lead, fall\r\nwith the same rapidity. Here in space is the same cause and the same\r\neffect.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Nicholl, “and everything we throw out of the projectile\r\nwill accompany it until it reaches the moon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! fools that we are!” exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n“Why that expletive?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Because we might have filled the projectile with useful objects,\r\nbooks, instruments, tools, etc. We could have thrown them all out, and\r\nall would have followed in our train. But happy thought! Why cannot we\r\nwalk outside like the meteor? Why cannot we launch into space through\r\nthe scuttle? What enjoyment it would be to feel oneself thus suspended\r\nin ether, more favored than the birds who must use their wings to keep\r\nthemselves up!”\r\n\r\n“Granted,” said Barbicane, “but how to breathe?”\r\n\r\n“Hang the air, to fail so inopportunely!”\r\n\r\n“But if it did not fail, Michel, your density being less than that of\r\nthe projectile, you would soon be left behind.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must remain in our car?”\r\n\r\n“We must!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Michel, in a load voice.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter,” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“I know, I guess, what this pretended meteor is! It is no asteroid\r\nwhich is accompanying us! It is not a piece of a planet.”\r\n\r\n“What is it then?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“It is our unfortunate dog! It is Diana’s husband!”\r\n\r\nIndeed, this deformed, unrecognizable object, reduced to nothing, was\r\nthe body of Satellite, flattened like a bagpipe without wind, and ever\r\nmounting, mounting!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nA MOMENT OF INTOXICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThus a phenomenon, curious but explicable, was happening under these\r\nstrange conditions.\r\n\r\nEvery object thrown from the projectile would follow the same course\r\nand never stop until it did. There was a subject for conversation which\r\nthe whole evening could not exhaust.\r\n\r\nBesides, the excitement of the three travelers increased as they drew\r\nnear the end of their journey. They expected unforseen incidents, and\r\nnew phenomena; and nothing would have astonished them in the frame of\r\nmind they then were in. Their overexcited imagination went faster than\r\nthe projectile, whose speed was evidently diminishing, though\r\ninsensibly to themselves. But the moon grew larger to their eyes, and\r\nthey fancied if they stretched out their hands they could seize it.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 5th of November, at five in the morning, all three\r\nwere on foot. That day was to be the last of their journey, if all\r\ncalculations were true. That very night, at twelve o’clock, in eighteen\r\nhours, exactly at the full moon, they would reach its brilliant disc.\r\nThe next midnight would see that journey ended, the most extraordinary\r\nof ancient or modern times. Thus from the first of the morning, through\r\nthe scuttles silvered by its rays, they saluted the orb of night with a\r\nconfident and joyous hurrah.\r\n\r\nThe moon was advancing majestically along the starry firmament. A few\r\nmore degrees, and she would reach the exact point where her meeting\r\nwith the projectile was to take place.\r\n\r\nAccording to his own observations, Barbicane reckoned that they would\r\nland on her northern hemisphere, where stretch immense plains, and\r\nwhere mountains are rare. A favorable circumstance if, as they thought,\r\nthe lunar atmosphere was stored only in its depths.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” observed Michel Ardan, “a plain is easier to disembark upon\r\nthan a mountain. A Selenite, deposited in Europe on the summit of Mont\r\nBlanc, or in Asia on the top of the Himalayas, would not be quite in\r\nthe right place.”\r\n\r\n“And,” added Captain Nicholl, “on a flat ground, the projectile will\r\nremain motionless when it has once touched; whereas on a declivity it\r\nwould roll like an avalanche, and not being squirrels we should not\r\ncome out safe and sound. So it is all for the best.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the success of the audacious attempt no longer appeared\r\ndoubtful. But Barbicane was preoccupied with one thought; but not\r\nwishing to make his companions uneasy, he kept silence on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe direction the projectile was taking toward the moon’s northern\r\nhemisphere, showed that her course had been slightly altered. The\r\ndischarge, mathematically calculated, would carry the projectile to the\r\nvery center of the lunar disc. If it did not land there, there must\r\nhave been some deviation. What had caused it? Barbicane could neither\r\nimagine nor determine the importance of the deviation, for there were\r\nno points to go by.\r\n\r\nHe hoped, however, that it would have no other result than that of\r\nbringing them nearer the upper border of the moon, a region more\r\nsuitable for landing.\r\n\r\nWithout imparting his uneasiness to his companions, Barbicane contented\r\nhimself with constantly observing the moon, in order to see whether the\r\ncourse of the projectile would not be altered; for the situation would\r\nhave been terrible if it failed in its aim, and being carried beyond\r\nthe disc should be launched into interplanetary space. At that moment,\r\nthe moon, instead of appearing flat like a disc, showed its convexity.\r\nIf the sun’s rays had struck it obliquely, the shadow thrown would have\r\nbrought out the high mountains, which would have been clearly detached.\r\nThe eye might have gazed into the crater’s gaping abysses, and followed\r\nthe capricious fissures which wound through the immense plains. But all\r\nrelief was as yet leveled in intense brilliancy. They could scarcely\r\ndistinguish those large spots which give the moon the appearance of a\r\nhuman face.\r\n\r\n“Face, indeed!” said Michel Ardan; “but I am sorry for the amiable\r\nsister of Apollo. A very pitted face!”\r\n\r\nBut the travelers, now so near the end, were incessantly observing this\r\nnew world. They imagined themselves walking through its unknown\r\ncountries, climbing its highest peaks, descending into its lowest\r\ndepths. Here and there they fancied they saw vast seas, scarcely kept\r\ntogether under so rarefied an atmosphere, and water-courses emptying\r\nthe mountain tributaries. Leaning over the abyss, they hoped to catch\r\nsome sounds from that orb forever mute in the solitude of space. That\r\nlast day left them.\r\n\r\nThey took down the most trifling details. A vague uneasiness took\r\npossession of them as they neared the end. This uneasiness would have\r\nbeen doubled had they felt how their speed had decreased. It would have\r\nseemed to them quite insufficient to carry them to the end. It was\r\nbecause the projectile then “weighed” almost nothing. Its weight was\r\never decreasing, and would be entirely annihilated on that line where\r\nthe lunar and terrestrial attractions would neutralize each other.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of his preoccupation, Michel Ardan did not forget to\r\nprepare the morning repast with his accustomed punctuality. They ate\r\nwith a good appetite. Nothing was so excellent as the soup liquefied by\r\nthe heat of the gas; nothing better than the preserved meat. Some\r\nglasses of good French wine crowned the repast, causing Michel Ardan to\r\nremark that the lunar vines, warmed by that ardent sun, ought to\r\ndistill even more generous wines; that is, if they existed. In any\r\ncase, the far-seeing Frenchman had taken care not to forget in his\r\ncollection some precious cuttings of the Medoc and Cote d’Or, upon\r\nwhich he founded his hopes.\r\n\r\nReiset and Regnaut’s apparatus worked with great regularity. Not an\r\natom of carbonic acid resisted the potash; and as to the oxygen,\r\nCaptain Nicholl said “it was of the first quality.” The little watery\r\nvapor enclosed in the projectile mixing with the air tempered the\r\ndryness; and many apartments in London, Paris, or New York, and many\r\ntheaters, were certainly not in such a healthy condition.\r\n\r\nBut that it might act with regularity, the apparatus must be kept in\r\nperfect order; so each morning Michel visited the escape regulators,\r\ntried the taps, and regulated the heat of the gas by the pyrometer.\r\nEverything had gone well up to that time, and the travelers, imitating\r\nthe worthy Joseph T. Maston, began to acquire a degree of embonpoint\r\nwhich would have rendered them unrecognizable if their imprisonment had\r\nbeen prolonged to some months. In a word, they behaved like chickens in\r\na coop; they were getting fat.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the scuttle Barbicane saw the specter of the dog,\r\nand other divers objects which had been thrown from the projectile,\r\nobstinately following them. Diana howled lugubriously on seeing the\r\nremains of Satellite, which seemed as motionless as if they reposed on\r\nsolid earth.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my friends,” said Michel Ardan, “that if one of us had\r\nsuccumbed to the shock consequent on departure, we should have had a\r\ngreat deal of trouble to bury him? What am I saying? to _etherize_ him,\r\nas here ether takes the place of earth. You see the accusing body would\r\nhave followed us into space like a remorse.”\r\n\r\n“That would have been sad,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” continued Michel, “what I regret is not being able to take a walk\r\noutside. What voluptuousness to float amid this radiant ether, to bathe\r\noneself in it, to wrap oneself in the sun’s pure rays. If Barbicane had\r\nonly thought of furnishing us with a diving apparatus and an air-pump,\r\nI could have ventured out and assumed fanciful attitudes of feigned\r\nmonsters on the top of the projectile.”\r\n\r\n“Well, old Michel,” replied Barbicane, “you would not have made a\r\nfeigned monster long, for in spite of your diver’s dress, swollen by\r\nthe expansion of air within you, you would have burst like a shell, or\r\nrather like a balloon which has risen too high. So do not regret it,\r\nand do not forget this—as long as we float in space, all sentimental\r\nwalks beyond the projectile are forbidden.”\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan allowed himself to be convinced to a certain extent. He\r\nadmitted that the thing was difficult but not impossible, a word which\r\nhe never uttered.\r\n\r\nThe conversation passed from this subject to another, not failing him\r\nfor an instant. It seemed to the three friends as though, under present\r\nconditions, ideas shot up in their brains as leaves shoot at the first\r\nwarmth of spring. They felt bewildered. In the middle of the questions\r\nand answers which crossed each other, Nicholl put one question which\r\ndid not find an immediate solution.\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” said he; “it is all very well to go to the moon, but how\r\nto get back again?”\r\n\r\nHis two interlocutors looked surprised. One would have thought that\r\nthis possibility now occurred to them for the first time.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that, Nicholl?” asked Barbicane gravely.\r\n\r\n“To ask for means to leave a country,” added Michel, “When we have not\r\nyet arrived there, seems to me rather inopportune.”\r\n\r\n“I do not say that, wishing to draw back,” replied Nicholl; “but I\r\nrepeat my question, and I ask, ‘How shall we return?’”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing about it,” answered Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“And I,” said Michel, “if I had known how to return, I would never have\r\nstarted.”\r\n\r\n“There’s an answer!” cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“I quite approve of Michel’s words,” said Barbicane; “and add, that the\r\nquestion has no real interest. Later, when we think it is advisable to\r\nreturn, we will take counsel together. If the Columbiad is not there,\r\nthe projectile will be.”\r\n\r\n“That is a step certainly. A ball without a gun!”\r\n\r\n“The gun,” replied Barbicane, “can be manufactured. The powder can be\r\nmade. Neither metals, saltpeter, nor coal can fail in the depths of the\r\nmoon, and we need only go 8,000 leagues in order to fall upon the\r\nterrestrial globe by virtue of the mere laws of weight.”\r\n\r\n“Enough,” said Michel with animation. “Let it be no longer a question\r\nof returning: we have already entertained it too long. As to\r\ncommunicating with our former earthly colleagues, that will not be\r\ndifficult.”\r\n\r\n“And how?”\r\n\r\n“By means of meteors launched by lunar volcanoes.”\r\n\r\n“Well thought of, Michel,” said Barbicane in a convinced tone of voice.\r\n“Laplace has calculated that a force five times greater than that of\r\nour gun would suffice to send a meteor from the moon to the earth, and\r\nthere is not one volcano which has not a greater power of propulsion\r\nthan that.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” exclaimed Michel; “these meteors are handy postmen, and cost\r\nnothing. And how we shall be able to laugh at the post-office\r\nadministration! But now I think of it—”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of?”\r\n\r\n“A capital idea. Why did we not fasten a thread to our projectile, and\r\nwe could have exchanged telegrams with the earth?”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” answered Nicholl. “Do you consider the weight of a thread\r\n250,000 miles long nothing?”\r\n\r\n“As nothing. They could have trebled the Columbiad’s charge; they could\r\nhave quadrupled or quintupled it!” exclaimed Michel, with whom the verb\r\ntook a higher intonation each time.\r\n\r\n“There is but one little objection to make to your proposition,”\r\nreplied Barbicane, “which is that, during the rotary motion of the\r\nglobe, our thread would have wound itself round it like a chain on a\r\ncapstan, and that it would inevitably have brought us to the ground.”\r\n\r\n“By the thirty-nine stars of the Union!” said Michel, “I have nothing\r\nbut impracticable ideas to-day; ideas worthy of J. T. Maston. But I\r\nhave a notion that, if we do not return to earth, J. T. Maston will be\r\nable to come to us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he’ll come,” replied Barbicane; “he is a worthy and a courageous\r\ncomrade. Besides, what is easier? Is not the Columbiad still buried in\r\nthe soil of Florida? Is cotton and nitric acid wanted wherewith to\r\nmanufacture the pyroxyle? Will not the moon pass the zenith of Florida?\r\nIn eighteen years’ time will she not occupy exactly the same place as\r\nto-day?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Michel, “yes, Maston will come, and with him our\r\nfriends Elphinstone, Blomsberry, all the members of the Gun Club, and\r\nthey will be well received. And by and by they will run trains of\r\nprojectiles between the earth and the moon! Hurrah for J. T. Maston!”\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, if the Hon. J. T. Maston did not hear the hurrahs\r\nuttered in his honor, his ears at least tingled. What was he doing\r\nthen? Doubtless, posted in the Rocky Mountains, at the station of\r\nLong’s Peak, he was trying to find the invisible projectile gravitating\r\nin space. If he was thinking of his dear companions, we must allow that\r\nthey were not far behind him; and that, under the influence of a\r\nstrange excitement, they were devoting to him their best thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut whence this excitement, which was evidently growing upon the\r\ntenants of the projectile? Their sobriety could not be doubted. This\r\nstrange irritation of the brain, must it be attributed to the peculiar\r\ncircumstances under which they found themselves, to their proximity to\r\nthe orb of night, from which only a few hours separated them, to some\r\nsecret influence of the moon acting upon their nervous system? Their\r\nfaces were as rosy as if they had been exposed to the roaring flames of\r\nan oven; their voices resounded in loud accents; their words escaped\r\nlike a champagne cork driven out by carbonic acid; their gestures\r\nbecame annoying, they wanted so much room to perform them; and, strange\r\nto say, they none of them noticed this great tension of the mind.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Nicholl, in a short tone, “now that I do not know whether\r\nwe shall ever return from the moon, I want to know what we are going to\r\ndo there?”\r\n\r\n“What we are going to do there?” replied Barbicane, stamping with his\r\nfoot as if he was in a fencing saloon; “I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“You do not know!” exclaimed Michel, with a bellow which provoked a\r\nsonorous echo in the projectile.\r\n\r\n“No, I have not even thought about it,” retorted Barbicane, in the same\r\nloud tone.\r\n\r\n“Well, I know,” replied Michel.\r\n\r\n“Speak, then,” cried Nicholl, who could no longer contain the growling\r\nof his voice.\r\n\r\n“I shall speak if it suits me,” exclaimed Michel, seizing his\r\ncompanions’ arms with violence.\r\n\r\n“ _It must_ suit you,” said Barbicane, with an eye on fire and a\r\nthreatening hand. “It was you who drew us into this frightful journey,\r\nand we want to know what for.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the captain, “now that I do not know _where_ I am going, I\r\nwant to know _why_ I am going.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” exclaimed Michel, jumping a yard high, “why? To take possession\r\nof the moon in the name of the United States; to add a fortieth State\r\nto the Union; to colonize the lunar regions; to cultivate them, to\r\npeople them, to transport thither all the prodigies of art, of science,\r\nand industry; to civilize the Selenites, unless they are more civilized\r\nthan we are; and to constitute them a republic, if they are not already\r\none!”\r\n\r\n“And if there are no Selenites?” retorted Nicholl, who, under the\r\ninfluence of this unaccountable intoxication, was very contradictory.\r\n\r\n“Who said that there were no Selenites?” exclaimed Michel in a\r\nthreatening tone.\r\n\r\n“I do,” howled Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Michel, “do not repeat that insolence, or I will knock\r\nyour teeth down your throat!”\r\n\r\nThe two adversaries were going to fall upon each other, and the\r\nincoherent discussion threatened to merge into a fight, when Barbicane\r\nintervened with one bound.\r\n\r\n“Stop, miserable men,” said he, separating his two companions; “if\r\nthere are no Selenites, we will do without them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” exclaimed Michel, who was not particular; “yes, we will do\r\nwithout them. We have only to make Selenites. Down with the Selenites!”\r\n\r\n“The empire of the moon belongs to us,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Let us three constitute the republic.”\r\n\r\n“I will be the congress,” cried Michel.\r\n\r\n“And I the senate,” retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“And Barbicane, the president,” howled Michel.\r\n\r\n“Not a president elected by the nation,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Very well, a president elected by the congress,” cried Michel; “and as\r\nI am the congress, you are unanimously elected!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! for President Barbicane,” exclaimed Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Hip! hip! hip!” vociferated Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nThen the president and the senate struck up in a tremendous voice the\r\npopular song “Yankee Doodle,” while from the congress resounded the\r\nmasculine tones of the “Marseillaise.”\r\n\r\nThen they struck up a frantic dance, with maniacal gestures, idiotic\r\nstampings, and somersaults like those of the boneless clowns in the\r\ncircus. Diana, joining in the dance, and howling in her turn, jumped to\r\nthe top of the projectile. An unaccountable flapping of wings was then\r\nheard amid most fantastic cock-crows, while five or six hens fluttered\r\nlike bats against the walls.\r\n\r\nThen the three traveling companions, acted upon by some unaccountable\r\ninfluence above that of intoxication, inflamed by the air which had set\r\ntheir respiratory apparatus on fire, fell motionless to the bottom of\r\nthe projectile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nAT SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN LEAGUES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had happened? Whence the cause of this singular intoxication, the\r\nconsequences of which might have been very disastrous? A simple blunder\r\nof Michel’s, which, fortunately, Nicholl was able to correct in time.\r\n\r\nAfter a perfect swoon, which lasted some minutes, the captain,\r\nrecovering first, soon collected his scattered senses. Although he had\r\nbreakfasted only two hours before, he felt a gnawing hunger, as if he\r\nhad not eaten anything for several days. Everything about him, stomach\r\nand brain, were overexcited to the highest degree. He got up and\r\ndemanded from Michel a supplementary repast. Michel, utterly done up,\r\ndid not answer.\r\n\r\nNicholl then tried to prepare some tea destined to help the absorption\r\nof a dozen sandwiches. He first tried to get some fire, and struck a\r\nmatch sharply. What was his surprise to see the sulphur shine with so\r\nextraordinary a brilliancy as to be almost unbearable to the eye. From\r\nthe gas-burner which he lit rose a flame equal to a jet of electric\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nA revelation dawned on Nicholl’s mind. That intensity of light, the\r\nphysiological troubles which had arisen in him, the overexcitement of\r\nall his moral and quarrelsome faculties—he understood all.\r\n\r\n“The oxygen!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd leaning over the air apparatus, he saw that the tap was allowing\r\nthe colorless gas to escape freely, life-giving, but in its pure state\r\nproducing the gravest disorders in the system. Michel had blunderingly\r\nopened the tap of the apparatus to the full.\r\n\r\nNicholl hastened to stop the escape of oxygen with which the atmosphere\r\nwas saturated, which would have been the death of the travelers, not by\r\nsuffocation, but by combustion. An hour later, the air less charged\r\nwith it restored the lungs to their normal condition. By degrees the\r\nthree friends recovered from their intoxication; but they were obliged\r\nto sleep themselves sober over their oxygen as a drunkard does over his\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nWhen Michel learned his share of the responsibility of this incident,\r\nhe was not much disconcerted. This unexpected drunkenness broke the\r\nmonotony of the journey. Many foolish things had been said while under\r\nits influence, but also quickly forgotten.\r\n\r\n“And then,” added the merry Frenchman, “I am not sorry to have tasted a\r\nlittle of this heady gas. Do you know, my friends, that a curious\r\nestablishment might be founded with rooms of oxygen, where people whose\r\nsystem is weakened could for a few hours live a more active life. Fancy\r\nparties where the room was saturated with this heroic fluid, theaters\r\nwhere it should be kept at high pressure; what passion in the souls of\r\nthe actors and spectators! what fire, what enthusiasm! And if, instead\r\nof an assembly only a whole people could be saturated, what activity in\r\nits functions, what a supplement to life it would derive. From an\r\nexhausted nation they might make a great and strong one, and I know\r\nmore than one state in old Europe which ought to put itself under the\r\nregime of oxygen for the sake of its health!”\r\n\r\nMichel spoke with so much animation that one might have fancied that\r\nthe tap was still too open. But a few words from Barbicane soon\r\nshattered his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“That is all very well, friend Michel,” said he, “but will you inform\r\nus where these chickens came from which have mixed themselves up in our\r\nconcert?”\r\n\r\n“Those chickens?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, half a dozen chickens and a fine cock were walking about,\r\nflapping their wings and chattering.\r\n\r\n“Ah, the awkward things!” exclaimed Michel. “The oxygen has made them\r\nrevolt.”\r\n\r\n“But what do you want to do with these chickens?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“To acclimatize them in the moon, by Jove!”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you hide them?”\r\n\r\n“A joke, my worthy president, a simple joke, which has proved a\r\nmiserable failure. I wanted to set them free on the lunar continent,\r\nwithout saying anything. Oh, what would have been your amazement on\r\nseeing these earthly-winged animals pecking in your lunar fields!”\r\n\r\n“You rascal, you unmitigated rascal,” replied Barbicane, “you do not\r\nwant oxygen to mount to the head. You are always what we were under the\r\ninfluence of the gas; you are always foolish!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, who says that we were not wise then?” replied Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nAfter this philosophical reflection, the three friends set about\r\nrestoring the order of the projectile. Chickens and cock were\r\nreinstated in their coop. But while proceeding with this operation,\r\nBarbicane and his two companions had a most desired perception of a new\r\nphenomenon. From the moment of leaving the earth, their own weight,\r\nthat of the projectile, and the objects it enclosed, had been subject\r\nto an increasing diminution. If they could not prove this loss of the\r\nprojectile, a moment would arrive when it would be sensibly felt upon\r\nthemselves and the utensils and instruments they used.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that a scale would not show this loss; for the\r\nweight destined to weight the object would have lost exactly as much as\r\nthe object itself; but a spring steelyard for example, the tension of\r\nwhich was independent of the attraction, would have given a just\r\nestimate of this loss.\r\n\r\nWe know that the attraction, otherwise called the weight, is in\r\nproportion to the densities of the bodies, and inversely as the squares\r\nof the distances. Hence this effect: If the earth had been alone in\r\nspace, if the other celestial bodies had been suddenly annihilated, the\r\nprojectile, according to Newton’s laws, would weigh less as it got\r\nfarther from the earth, but without ever losing its weight entirely,\r\nfor the terrestrial attraction would always have made itself felt, at\r\nwhatever distance.\r\n\r\nBut, in reality, a time must come when the projectile would no longer\r\nbe subject to the law of weight, after allowing for the other celestial\r\nbodies whose effect could not be set down as zero. Indeed, the\r\nprojectile’s course was being traced between the earth and the moon. As\r\nit distanced the earth, the terrestrial attraction diminished: but the\r\nlunar attraction rose in proportion. There must come a point where\r\nthese two attractions would neutralize each other: the projectile would\r\npossess weight no longer. If the moon’s and the earth’s densities had\r\nbeen equal, this point would have been at an equal distance between the\r\ntwo orbs. But taking the different densities into consideration, it was\r\neasy to reckon that this point would be situated at 47/60ths of the\r\nwhole journey, _i.e._, at 78,514 leagues from the earth. At this point,\r\na body having no principle of speed or displacement in itself, would\r\nremain immovable forever, being attracted equally by both orbs, and not\r\nbeing drawn more toward one than toward the other.\r\n\r\nNow if the projectile’s impulsive force had been correctly calculated,\r\nit would attain this point without speed, having lost all trace of\r\nweight, as well as all the objects within it. What would happen then?\r\nThree hypotheses presented themselves.\r\n\r\n1. Either it would retain a certain amount of motion, and pass the\r\npoint of equal attraction, and fall upon the moon by virtue of the\r\nexcess of the lunar attraction over the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n2. Or, its speed failing, and unable to reach the point of equal\r\nattraction, it would fall upon the moon by virtue of the excess of the\r\nlunar attraction over the terrestrial.\r\n\r\n3. Or, lastly, animated with sufficient speed to enable it to reach the\r\nneutral point, but not sufficient to pass it, it would remain forever\r\nsuspended in that spot like the pretended tomb of Mahomet, between the\r\nzenith and the nadir.\r\n\r\nSuch was their situation; and Barbicane clearly explained the\r\nconsequences to his traveling companions, which greatly interested\r\nthem. But how should they know when the projectile had reached this\r\nneutral point situated at that distance, especially when neither\r\nthemselves, nor the objects enclosed in the projectile, would be any\r\nlonger subject to the laws of weight?\r\n\r\nUp to this time, the travelers, while admitting that this action was\r\nconstantly decreasing, had not yet become sensible to its total\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nBut that day, about eleven o’clock in the morning, Nicholl having\r\naccidentally let a glass slip from his hand, the glass, instead of\r\nfalling, remained suspended in the air.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “that is rather an amusing piece of\r\nnatural philosophy.”\r\n\r\nAnd immediately divers other objects, firearms and bottles, abandoned\r\nto themselves, held themselves up as by enchantment. Diana too, placed\r\nin space by Michel, reproduced, but without any trick, the wonderful\r\nsuspension practiced by Caston and Robert Houdin. Indeed the dog did\r\nnot seem to know that she was floating in air.\r\n\r\nThe three adventurous companions were surprised and stupefied, despite\r\ntheir scientific reasonings. They felt themselves being carried into\r\nthe domain of wonders! they felt that weight was really wanting to\r\ntheir bodies. If they stretched out their arms, they did not attempt to\r\nfall. Their heads shook on their shoulders. Their feet no longer clung\r\nto the floor of the projectile. They were like drunken men having no\r\nstability in themselves.\r\n\r\nFancy has depicted men without reflection, others without shadow. But\r\nhere reality, by the neutralizations of attractive forces, produced men\r\nin whom nothing had any weight, and who weighed nothing themselves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Michel, taking a spring, left the floor and remained suspended\r\nin the air, like Murillo’s monk of the _Cusine des Anges_.\r\n\r\nThe two friends joined him instantly, and all three formed a miraculous\r\n“Ascension” in the center of the projectile.\r\n\r\n“Is it to be believed? is it probable? is it possible?” exclaimed\r\nMichel; “and yet it is so. Ah! if Raphael had seen us thus, what an\r\n‘Assumption’ he would have thrown upon canvas!”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Assumption’ cannot last,” replied Barbicane. “If the projectile\r\npasses the neutral point, the lunar attraction will draw us to the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n“Then our feet will be upon the roof,” replied Michel.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Barbicane, “because the projectile’s center of gravity is\r\nvery low; it will only turn by degrees.”\r\n\r\n“Then all our portables will be upset from top to bottom, that is a\r\nfact.”\r\n\r\n“Calm yourself, Michel,” replied Nicholl; “no upset is to be feared;\r\nnot a thing will move, for the projectile’s evolution will be\r\nimperceptible.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” continued Barbicane; “and when it has passed the point of\r\nequal attraction, its base, being the heavier, will draw it\r\nperpendicularly to the moon; but, in order that this phenomenon should\r\ntake place, we must have passed the neutral line.”\r\n\r\n“Pass the neutral line,” cried Michel; “then let us do as the sailors\r\ndo when they cross the equator.”\r\n\r\nA slight side movement brought Michel back toward the padded side;\r\nthence he took a bottle and glasses, placed them “in space” before his\r\ncompanions, and, drinking merrily, they saluted the line with a triple\r\nhurrah. The influence of these attractions scarcely lasted an hour; the\r\ntravelers felt themselves insensibly drawn toward the floor, and\r\nBarbicane fancied that the conical end of the projectile was varying a\r\nlittle from its normal direction toward the moon. By an inverse motion\r\nthe base was approaching first; the lunar attraction was prevailing\r\nover the terrestrial; the fall toward the moon was beginning, almost\r\nimperceptibly as yet, but by degrees the attractive force would become\r\nstronger, the fall would be more decided, the projectile, drawn by its\r\nbase, would turn its cone to the earth, and fall with ever-increasing\r\nspeed on to the surface of the Selenite continent; their destination\r\nwould then be attained. Now nothing could prevent the success of their\r\nenterprise, and Nicholl and Michel Ardan shared Barbicane’s joy.\r\n\r\nThen they chatted of all the phenomena which had astonished them one\r\nafter the other, particularly the neutralization of the laws of weight.\r\nMichel Ardan, always enthusiastic, drew conclusions which were purely\r\nfanciful.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my worthy friends,” he exclaimed, “what progress we should make if\r\non earth we could throw off some of that weight, some of that chain\r\nwhich binds us to her; it would be the prisoner set at liberty; no more\r\nfatigue of either arms or legs. Or, if it is true that in order to fly\r\non the earth’s surface, to keep oneself suspended in the air merely by\r\nthe play of the muscles, there requires a strength a hundred and fifty\r\ntimes greater than that which we possess, a simple act of volition, a\r\ncaprice, would bear us into space, if attraction did not exist.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Nicholl, smiling; “if we could succeed in suppressing\r\nweight as they suppress pain by anaesthesia, that would change the face\r\nof modern society!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Michel, full of his subject, “destroy weight, and no more\r\nburdens!”\r\n\r\n“Well said,” replied Barbicane; “but if nothing had any weight, nothing\r\nwould keep in its place, not even your hat on your head, worthy Michel;\r\nnor your house, whose stones only adhere by weight; nor a boat, whose\r\nstability on the waves is only caused by weight; not even the ocean,\r\nwhose waves would no longer be equalized by terrestrial attraction; and\r\nlastly, not even the atmosphere, whose atoms, being no longer held in\r\ntheir places, would disperse in space!”\r\n\r\n“That is tiresome,” retorted Michel; “nothing like these matter-of-fact\r\npeople for bringing one back to the bare reality.”\r\n\r\n“But console yourself, Michel,” continued Barbicane, “for if no orb\r\nexists from whence all laws of weight are banished, you are at least\r\ngoing to visit one where it is much less than on the earth.”\r\n\r\n“The moon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the moon, on whose surface objects weigh six times less than on\r\nthe earth, a phenomenon easy to prove.”\r\n\r\n“And we shall feel it?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“Evidently, as two hundred pounds will only weigh thirty pounds on the\r\nsurface of the moon.”\r\n\r\n“And our muscular strength will not diminish?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; instead of jumping one yard high, you will rise eighteen\r\nfeet high.”\r\n\r\n“But we shall be regular Herculeses in the moon!” exclaimed Michel.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Nicholl; “for if the height of the Selenites is in\r\nproportion to the density of their globe, they will be scarcely a foot\r\nhigh.”\r\n\r\n“Lilliputians!” ejaculated Michel; “I shall play the part of Gulliver.\r\nWe are going to realize the fable of the giants. This is the advantage\r\nof leaving one’s own planet and over-running the solar world.”\r\n\r\n“One moment, Michel,” answered Barbicane; “if you wish to play the part\r\nof Gulliver, only visit the inferior planets, such as Mercury, Venus,\r\nor Mars, whose density is a little less than that of the earth; but do\r\nnot venture into the great planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune;\r\nfor there the order will be changed, and you will become Lilliputian.”\r\n\r\n“And in the sun?”\r\n\r\n“In the sun, if its density is thirteen hundred and twenty-four\r\nthousand times greater, and the attraction is twenty-seven times\r\ngreater than on the surface of our globe, keeping everything in\r\nproportion, the inhabitants ought to be at least two hundred feet\r\nhigh.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” exclaimed Michel; “I should be nothing more than a pigmy, a\r\nshrimp!”\r\n\r\n“Gulliver with the giants,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“And it would not be quite useless to carry some pieces of artillery to\r\ndefend oneself.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” replied Nicholl; “your projectiles would have no effect on the\r\nsun; they would fall back upon the earth after some minutes.”\r\n\r\n“That is a strong remark.”\r\n\r\n“It is certain,” replied Barbicane; “the attraction is so great on this\r\nenormous orb, that an object weighing 70,000 pounds on the earth would\r\nweigh but 1,920 pounds on the surface of the sun. If you were to fall\r\nupon it you would weigh—let me see—about 5,000 pounds, a weight which\r\nyou would never be able to raise again.”\r\n\r\n“The devil!” said Michel; “one would want a portable crane. However, we\r\nwill be satisfied with the moon for the present; there at least we\r\nshall cut a great figure. We will see about the sun by and by.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF A DEVIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane had now no fear of the issue of the journey, at least as far\r\nas the projectile’s impulsive force was concerned; its own speed would\r\ncarry it beyond the neutral line; it would certainly not return to\r\nearth; it would certainly not remain motionless on the line of\r\nattraction. One single hypothesis remained to be realized, the arrival\r\nof the projectile at its destination by the action of the lunar\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nIt was in reality a fall of 8,296 leagues on an orb, it is true, where\r\nweight could only be reckoned at one sixth of terrestrial weight; a\r\nformidable fall, nevertheless, and one against which every precaution\r\nmust be taken without delay.\r\n\r\nThese precautions were of two sorts, some to deaden the shock when the\r\nprojectile should touch the lunar soil, others to delay the fall, and\r\nconsequently make it less violent.\r\n\r\nTo deaden the shock, it was a pity that Barbicane was no longer able to\r\nemploy the means which had so ably weakened the shock at departure,\r\nthat is to say, by water used as springs and the partition breaks.\r\n\r\nThe partitions still existed, but water failed, for they could not use\r\ntheir reserve, which was precious, in case during the first days the\r\nliquid element should be found wanting on lunar soil.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed this reserve would have been quite insufficient for a\r\nspring. The layer of water stored in the projectile at the time of\r\nstarting upon their journey occupied no less than three feet in depth,\r\nand spread over a surface of not less than fifty-four square feet.\r\nBesides, the cistern did not contain one-fifth part of it; they must\r\ntherefore give up this efficient means of deadening the shock of\r\narrival. Happily, Barbicane, not content with employing water, had\r\nfurnished the movable disc with strong spring plugs, destined to lessen\r\nthe shock against the base after the breaking of the horizontal\r\npartitions. These plugs still existed; they had only to readjust them\r\nand replace the movable disc; every piece, easy to handle, as their\r\nweight was now scarcely felt, was quickly mounted.\r\n\r\nThe different pieces were fitted without trouble, it being only a\r\nmatter of bolts and screws; tools were not wanting, and soon the\r\nreinstated disc lay on steel plugs, like a table on its legs. One\r\ninconvenience resulted from the replacing of the disc, the lower window\r\nwas blocked up; thus it was impossible for the travelers to observe the\r\nmoon from that opening while they were being precipitated\r\nperpendicularly upon her; but they were obliged to give it up; even by\r\nthe side openings they could still see vast lunar regions, as an\r\naeronaut sees the earth from his car.\r\n\r\nThis replacing of the disc was at least an hour’s work. It was past\r\ntwelve when all preparations were finished. Barbicane took fresh\r\nobservations on the inclination of the projectile, but to his annoyance\r\nit had not turned over sufficiently for its fall; it seemed to take a\r\ncurve parallel to the lunar disc. The orb of night shone splendidly\r\ninto space, while opposite, the orb of day blazed with fire.\r\n\r\nTheir situation began to make them uneasy.\r\n\r\n“Are we reaching our destination?” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Let us act as if we were about reaching it,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“You are sceptical,” retorted Michel Ardan. “We shall arrive, and that,\r\ntoo, quicker than we like.”\r\n\r\nThis answer brought Barbicane back to his preparations, and he occupied\r\nhimself with placing the contrivances intended to break their descent.\r\nWe may remember the scene of the meeting held at Tampa Town, in\r\nFlorida, when Captain Nicholl came forward as Barbicane’s enemy and\r\nMichel Ardan’s adversary. To Captain Nicholl’s maintaining that the\r\nprojectile would smash like glass, Michel replied that he would break\r\ntheir fall by means of rockets properly placed.\r\n\r\nThus, powerful fireworks, taking their starting-point from the base and\r\nbursting outside, could, by producing a recoil, check to a certain\r\ndegree the projectile’s speed. These rockets were to burn in space, it\r\nis true; but oxygen would not fail them, for they could supply\r\nthemselves with it, like the lunar volcanoes, the burning of which has\r\nnever yet been stopped by the want of atmosphere round the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had accordingly supplied himself with these fireworks,\r\nenclosed in little steel guns, which could be screwed on to the base of\r\nthe projectile. Inside, these guns were flush with the bottom; outside,\r\nthey protruded about eighteen inches. There were twenty of them. An\r\nopening left in the disc allowed them to light the match with which\r\neach was provided. All the effect was felt outside. The burning mixture\r\nhad already been rammed into each gun. They had, then, nothing to do\r\nbut raise the metallic buffers fixed in the base, and replace them by\r\nthe guns, which fitted closely in their places.\r\n\r\nThis new work was finished about three o’clock, and after taking all\r\nthese precautions there remained but to wait. But the projectile was\r\nperceptibly nearing the moon, and evidently succumbed to her influence\r\nto a certain degree; though its own velocity also drew it in an oblique\r\ndirection. From these conflicting influences resulted a line which\r\nmight become a tangent. But it was certain that the projectile would\r\nnot fall directly on the moon; for its lower part, by reason of its\r\nweight, ought to be turned toward her.\r\n\r\nBarbicane’s uneasiness increased as he saw his projectile resist the\r\ninfluence of gravitation. The Unknown was opening before him, the\r\nUnknown in interplanetary space. The man of science thought he had\r\nforeseen the only three hypotheses possible—the return to the earth,\r\nthe return to the moon, or stagnation on the neutral line; and here a\r\nfourth hypothesis, big with all the terrors of the Infinite, surged up\r\ninopportunely. To face it without flinching, one must be a resolute\r\nsavant like Barbicane, a phlegmatic being like Nicholl, or an audacious\r\nadventurer like Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nConversation was started upon this subject. Other men would have\r\nconsidered the question from a practical point of view; they would have\r\nasked themselves whither their projectile carriage was carrying them.\r\nNot so with these; they sought for the cause which produced this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n“So we have become diverted from our route,” said Michel; “but why?”\r\n\r\n“I very much fear,” answered Nicholl, “that, in spite of all\r\nprecautions taken, the Columbiad was not fairly pointed. An error,\r\nhowever small, would be enough to throw us out of the moon’s\r\nattraction.”\r\n\r\n“Then they must have aimed badly?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“I do not think so,” replied Barbicane. “The perpendicularity of the\r\ngun was exact, its direction to the zenith of the spot incontestible;\r\nand the moon passing to the zenith of the spot, we ought to reach it at\r\nthe full. There is another reason, but it escapes me.”\r\n\r\n“Are we not arriving too late?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Too late?” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Nicholl. “The Cambridge Observatory’s note says that\r\nthe transit ought to be accomplished in ninety-seven hours thirteen\r\nminutes and twenty seconds; which means to say, that _sooner_ the moon\r\nwill _not_ be at the point indicated, and _later_ it will have passed\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“True,” replied Barbicane. “But we started the 1st of December, at\r\nthirteen minutes and twenty-five seconds to eleven at night; and we\r\nought to arrive on the 5th at midnight, at the exact moment when the\r\nmoon would be full; and we are now at the 5th of December. It is now\r\nhalf-past three in the evening; half-past eight ought to see us at the\r\nend of our journey. Why do we not arrive?”\r\n\r\n“Might it not be an excess of speed?” answered Nicholl; “for we know\r\nnow that its initial velocity was greater than they supposed.”\r\n\r\n“No! a hundred times, no!” replied Barbicane. “An excess of speed, if\r\nthe direction of the projectile had been right, would not have\r\nprevented us reaching the moon. No, there has been a deviation. We have\r\nbeen turned out of our course.”\r\n\r\n“By whom? by what?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Very well, then, Barbicane,” said Michel, “do you wish to know my\r\nopinion on the subject of finding out this deviation?”\r\n\r\n“Speak.”\r\n\r\n“I would not give half a dollar to know it. That we have deviated is a\r\nfact. Where we are going matters little; we shall soon see. Since we\r\nare being borne along in space we shall end by falling into some center\r\nof attraction or other.”\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan’s indifference did not content Barbicane. Not that he was\r\nuneasy about the future, but he wanted to know at any cost _why_ his\r\nprojectile had deviated.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile continued its course sideways to the moon, and with\r\nit the mass of things thrown out. Barbicane could even prove, by the\r\nelevations which served as landmarks upon the moon, which was only two\r\nthousand leagues distant, that its speed was becoming uniform—fresh\r\nproof that there was no fall. Its impulsive force still prevailed over\r\nthe lunar attraction, but the projectile’s course was certainly\r\nbringing it nearer to the moon, and they might hope that at a nearer\r\npoint the weight, predominating, would cause a decided fall.\r\n\r\nThe three friends, having nothing better to do, continued their\r\nobservations; but they could not yet determine the topographical\r\nposition of the satellite; every relief was leveled under the\r\nreflection of the solar rays.\r\n\r\nThey watched thus through the side windows until eight o’clock at\r\nnight. The moon had grown so large in their eyes that it filled half of\r\nthe firmament. The sun on one side, and the orb of night on the other,\r\nflooded the projectile with light.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Barbicane thought he could estimate the distance which\r\nseparated them from their aim at no more than 700 leagues. The speed of\r\nthe projectile seemed to him to be more than 200 yards, or about 170\r\nleagues a second. Under the centripetal force, the base of the\r\nprojectile tended toward the moon; but the centrifugal still prevailed;\r\nand it was probable that its rectilineal course would be changed to a\r\ncurve of some sort, the nature of which they could not at present\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nBarbicane was still seeking the solution of his insoluble problem.\r\nHours passed without any result. The projectile was evidently nearing\r\nthe moon, but it was also evident that it would never reach her. As to\r\nthe nearest distance at which it would pass her, that must be the\r\nresult of two forces, attraction and repulsion, affecting its motion.\r\n\r\n“I ask but one thing,” said Michel; “that we may pass near enough to\r\npenetrate her secrets.”\r\n\r\n“Cursed be the thing that has caused our projectile to deviate from its\r\ncourse,” cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\nAnd, as if a light had suddenly broken in upon his mind, Barbicane\r\nanswered, “Then cursed be the meteor which crossed our path.”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” exclaimed Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said Barbicane in a decided tone, “I mean that our deviation\r\nis owing solely to our meeting with this erring body.”\r\n\r\n“But it did not even brush us as it passed,” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“What does that matter? Its mass, compared to that of our projectile,\r\nwas enormous, and its attraction was enough to influence our course.”\r\n\r\n“So little?” cried Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Nicholl; but however little it might be,” replied Barbicane, “in\r\na distance of 84,000 leagues, it wanted no more to make us miss the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nTHE OBSERVERS OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nBarbicane had evidently hit upon the only plausible reason of this\r\ndeviation. However slight it might have been, it had sufficed to modify\r\nthe course of the projectile. It was a fatality. The bold attempt had\r\nmiscarried by a fortuitous circumstance; and unless by some exceptional\r\nevent, they could now never reach the moon’s disc.\r\n\r\nWould they pass near enough to be able to solve certain physical and\r\ngeological questions until then insoluble? This was the question, and\r\nthe only one, which occupied the minds of these bold travelers. As to\r\nthe fate in store for themselves, they did not even dream of it.\r\n\r\nBut what would become of them amid these infinite solitudes, these who\r\nwould soon want air? A few more days, and they would fall stifled in\r\nthis wandering projectile. But some days to these intrepid fellows was\r\na century; and they devoted all their time to observe that moon which\r\nthey no longer hoped to reach.\r\n\r\nThe distance which had then separated the projectile from the satellite\r\nwas estimated at about two hundred leagues. Under these conditions, as\r\nregards the visibility of the details of the disc, the travelers were\r\nfarther from the moon than are the inhabitants of earth with their\r\npowerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we know that the instrument mounted by Lord Rosse at\r\nParsonstown, which magnifies 6,500 times, brings the moon to within an\r\napparent distance of sixteen leagues. And more than that, with the\r\npowerful one set up at Long’s Peak, the orb of night, magnified 48,000\r\ntimes, is brought to within less than two leagues, and objects having a\r\ndiameter of thirty feet are seen very distinctly. So that, at this\r\ndistance, the topographical details of the moon, observed without\r\nglasses, could not be determined with precision. The eye caught the\r\nvast outline of those immense depressions inappropriately called\r\n“seas,” but they could not recognize their nature. The prominence of\r\nthe mountains disappeared under the splendid irradiation produced by\r\nthe reflection of the solar rays. The eye, dazzled as if it was leaning\r\nover a bath of molten silver, turned from it involuntarily; but the\r\noblong form of the orb was quite clear. It appeared like a gigantic\r\negg, with the small end turned toward the earth. Indeed the moon,\r\nliquid and pliable in the first days of its formation, was originally a\r\nperfect sphere; but being soon drawn within the attraction of the\r\nearth, it became elongated under the influence of gravitation. In\r\nbecoming a satellite, she lost her native purity of form; her center of\r\ngravity was in advance of the center of her figure; and from this fact\r\nsome savants draw the conclusion that the air and water had taken\r\nrefuge on the opposite surface of the moon, which is never seen from\r\nthe earth. This alteration in the primitive form of the satellite was\r\nonly perceptible for a few moments. The distance of the projectile from\r\nthe moon diminished very rapidly under its speed, though that was much\r\nless than its initial velocity—but eight or nine times greater than\r\nthat which propels our express trains. The oblique course of the\r\nprojectile, from its very obliquity, gave Michel Ardan some hopes of\r\nstriking the lunar disc at some point or other. He could not think that\r\nthey would never reach it. No! he could not believe it; and this\r\nopinion he often repeated. But Barbicane, who was a better judge,\r\nalways answered him with merciless logic.\r\n\r\n“No, Michel, no! We can only reach the moon by a fall, and we are not\r\nfalling. The centripetal force keeps us under the moon’s influence, but\r\nthe centrifugal force draws us irresistibly away from it.”\r\n\r\nThis was said in a tone which quenched Michel Ardan’s last hope.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the moon which the projectile was nearing was the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, that which the selenographic maps place below; for\r\nthese maps are generally drawn after the outline given by the glasses,\r\nand we know that they reverse the objects. Such was the _Mappa\r\nSelenographica_ of Boeer and Moedler which Barbicane consulted. This\r\nnorthern hemisphere presented vast plains, dotted with isolated\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the moon was full. At that precise moment the travelers\r\nshould have alighted upon it, if the mischievous meteor had not\r\ndiverted their course. The orb was exactly in the condition determined\r\nby the Cambridge Observatory. It was mathematically at its perigee, and\r\nat the zenith of the twenty-eighth parallel. An observer placed at the\r\nbottom of the enormous Columbiad, pointed perpendicularly to the\r\nhorizon, would have framed the moon in the mouth of the gun. A straight\r\nline drawn through the axis of the piece would have passed through the\r\ncenter of the orb of night. It is needless to say, that during the\r\nnight of the 5th-6th of December, the travelers took not an instant’s\r\nrest. Could they close their eyes when so near this new world? No! All\r\ntheir feelings were concentrated in one single thought:—See!\r\nRepresentatives of the earth, of humanity, past and present, all\r\ncentered in them! It is through their eyes that the human race look at\r\nthese lunar regions, and penetrate the secrets of their satellite! A\r\nstrange emotion filled their hearts as they went from one window to the\r\nother. Their observations, reproduced by Barbicane, were rigidly\r\ndetermined. To take them, they had glasses; to correct them, maps.\r\n\r\nAs regards the optical instruments at their disposal, they had\r\nexcellent marine glasses specially constructed for this journey. They\r\npossessed magnifying powers of 100. They would thus have brought the\r\nmoon to within a distance (apparent) of less than 2,000 leagues from\r\nthe earth. But then, at a distance which for three hours in the morning\r\ndid not exceed sixty-five miles, and in a medium free from all\r\natmospheric disturbances, these instruments could reduce the lunar\r\nsurface to within less than 1,500 yards!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nFANCY AND REALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n“Have you ever seen the moon?” asked a professor, ironically, of one of\r\nhis pupils.\r\n\r\n“No, sir!” replied the pupil, still more ironically, “but I must say I\r\nhave heard it spoken of.”\r\n\r\nIn one sense, the pupil’s witty answer might be given by a large\r\nmajority of sublunary beings. How many people have heard speak of the\r\nmoon who have never seen it—at least through a glass or a telescope!\r\nHow many have never examined the map of their satellite!\r\n\r\nIn looking at a selenographic map, one peculiarity strikes us. Contrary\r\nto the arrangement followed for that of the Earth and Mars, the\r\ncontinents occupy more particularly the southern hemisphere of the\r\nlunar globe. These continents do not show such decided, clear, and\r\nregular boundary lines as South America, Africa, and the Indian\r\npeninsula. Their angular, capricious, and deeply indented coasts are\r\nrich in gulfs and peninsulas. They remind one of the confusion in the\r\nislands of the Sound, where the land is excessively indented. If\r\nnavigation ever existed on the surface of the moon, it must have been\r\nwonderfully difficult and dangerous; and we may well pity the Selenite\r\nsailors and hydrographers; the former, when they came upon these\r\nperilous coasts, the latter when they took the soundings of its stormy\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nWe may also notice that, on the lunar sphere, the south pole is much\r\nmore continental than the north pole. On the latter, there is but one\r\nslight strip of land separated from other continents by vast seas.\r\nToward the south, continents clothe almost the whole of the hemisphere.\r\nIt is even possible that the Selenites have already planted the flag on\r\none of their poles, while Franklin, Ross, Kane, Dumont, d’Urville, and\r\nLambert have never yet been able to attain that unknown point of the\r\nterrestrial globe.\r\n\r\nAs to islands, they are numerous on the surface of the moon. Nearly all\r\noblong or circular, and as if traced with the compass, they seem to\r\nform one vast archipelago, equal to that charming group lying between\r\nGreece and Asia Minor, and which mythology in ancient times adorned\r\nwith most graceful legends. Involuntarily the names of Naxos, Tenedos,\r\nand Carpathos, rise before the mind, and we seek vainly for Ulysses’\r\nvessel or the “clipper” of the Argonauts. So at least it was in Michel\r\nArdan’s eyes. To him it was a Grecian archipelago that he saw on the\r\nmap. To the eyes of his matter-of-fact companions, the aspect of these\r\ncoasts recalled rather the parceled-out land of New Brunswick and Nova\r\nScotia, and where the Frenchman discovered traces of the heroes of\r\nfable, these Americans were marking the most favorable points for the\r\nestablishment of stores in the interests of lunar commerce and\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAfter wandering over these vast continents, the eye is attracted by the\r\nstill greater seas. Not only their formation, but their situation and\r\naspect remind one of the terrestrial oceans; but again, as on earth,\r\nthese seas occupy the greater portion of the globe. But in point of\r\nfact, these are not liquid spaces, but plains, the nature of which the\r\ntravelers hoped soon to determine. Astronomers, we must allow, have\r\ngraced these pretended seas with at least odd names, which science has\r\nrespected up to the present time. Michel Ardan was right when he\r\ncompared this map to a “Tendre card,” got up by a Scudary or a Cyrano\r\nde Bergerac. “Only,” said he, “it is no longer the sentimental card of\r\nthe seventeenth century, it is the card of life, very neatly divided\r\ninto two parts, one feminine, the other masculine; the right hemisphere\r\nfor woman, the left for man.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking thus, Michel made his prosaic companions shrug their\r\nshoulders. Barbicane and Nicholl looked upon the lunar map from a very\r\ndifferent point of view to that of their fantastic friend.\r\nNevertheless, their fantastic friend was a little in the right. Judge\r\nfor yourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the left hemisphere stretches the “Sea of Clouds,” where human\r\nreason is so often shipwrecked. Not far off lies the “Sea of Rains,”\r\nfed by all the fever of existence. Near this is the “Sea of Storms,”\r\nwhere man is ever fighting against his passions, which too often gain\r\nthe victory. Then, worn out by deceit, treasons, infidelity, and the\r\nwhole body of terrestrial misery, what does he find at the end of his\r\ncareer? that vast “Sea of Humors,” barely softened by some drops of the\r\nwaters from the “Gulf of Dew!” Clouds, rain, storms, and humors—does\r\nthe life of man contain aught but these? and is it not summed up in\r\nthese four words?\r\n\r\nThe right hemisphere, “dedicated to the ladies,” encloses smaller seas,\r\nwhose significant names contain every incident of a feminine existence.\r\nThere is the “Sea of Serenity,” over which the young girl bends; “The\r\nLake of Dreams,” reflecting a joyous future; “The Sea of Nectar,” with\r\nits waves of tenderness and breezes of love; “The Sea of Fruitfulness;”\r\n“The Sea of Crises;” then the “Sea of Vapors,” whose dimensions are\r\nperhaps a little too confined; and lastly, that vast “Sea of\r\nTranquillity,” in which every false passion, every useless dream, every\r\nunsatisfied desire is at length absorbed, and whose waves emerge\r\npeacefully into the “Lake of Death!”\r\n\r\nWhat a strange succession of names! What a singular division of the\r\nmoon’s two hemispheres, joined to one another like man and woman, and\r\nforming that sphere of life carried into space! And was not the\r\nfantastic Michel right in thus interpreting the fancies of the ancient\r\nastronomers? But while his imagination thus roved over “the seas,” his\r\ngrave companions were considering things more geographically. They were\r\nlearning this new world by heart. They were measuring angles and\r\ndiameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nOROGRAPHIC DETAILS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course taken by the projectile, as we have before remarked, was\r\nbearing it toward the moon’s northern hemisphere. The travelers were\r\nfar from the central point which they would have struck, had their\r\ncourse not been subject to an irremediable deviation. It was past\r\nmidnight; and Barbicane then estimated the distance at seven hundred\r\nand fifty miles, which was a little greater than the length of the\r\nlunar radius, and which would diminish as it advanced nearer to the\r\nNorth Pole. The projectile was then not at the altitude of the equator;\r\nbut across the tenth parallel, and from that latitude, carefully taken\r\non the map to the pole, Barbicane and his two companions were able to\r\nobserve the moon under the most favorable conditions. Indeed, by means\r\nof glasses, the above-named distance was reduced to little more than\r\nfourteen miles. The telescope of the Rocky Mountains brought the moon\r\nmuch nearer; but the terrestrial atmosphere singularly lessened its\r\npower. Thus Barbicane, posted in his projectile, with the glasses to\r\nhis eyes, could seize upon details which were almost imperceptible to\r\nearthly observers.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said the president, in a serious voice, “I do not know\r\nwhither we are going; I do not know if we shall ever see the\r\nterrestrial globe again. Nevertheless, let us proceed as if our work\r\nwould one day by useful to our fellow-men. Let us keep our minds free\r\nfrom every other consideration. We are astronomers; and this projectile\r\nis a room in the Cambridge University, carried into space. Let us make\r\nour observations!”\r\n\r\nThis said, work was begun with great exactness; and they faithfully\r\nreproduced the different aspects of the moon, at the different\r\ndistances which the projectile reached.\r\n\r\nAt the time that the projectile was as high as the tenth parallel,\r\nnorth latitude, it seemed rigidly to follow the twentieth degree, east\r\nlongitude. We must here make one important remark with regard to the\r\nmap by which they were taking observations. In the selenographical maps\r\nwhere, on account of the reversing of the objects by the glasses, the\r\nsouth is above and the north below, it would seem natural that, on\r\naccount of that inversion, the east should be to the left hand, and the\r\nwest to the right. But it is not so. If the map were turned upside\r\ndown, showing the moon as we see her, the east would be to the left,\r\nand the west to the right, contrary to that which exists on terrestrial\r\nmaps. The following is the reason of this anomaly. Observers in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere (say in Europe) see the moon in the south—according\r\nto them. When they take observations, they turn their backs to the\r\nnorth, the reverse position to that which they occupy when they study a\r\nterrestrial map. As they turn their backs to the north, the east is on\r\ntheir left, and the west to their right. To observers in the southern\r\nhemisphere (Patagonia for example), the moon’s west would be quite to\r\ntheir left, and the east to their right, as the south is behind them.\r\nSuch is the reason of the apparent reversing of these two cardinal\r\npoints, and we must bear it in mind in order to be able to follow\r\nPresident Barbicane’s observations.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Boeer and Moedler’s _Mappa Selenographica_, the\r\ntravelers were able at once to recognize that portion of the disc\r\nenclosed within the field of their glasses.\r\n\r\n“What are we looking at, at this moment?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“At the northern part of the ‘Sea of Clouds,’” answered Barbicane. “We\r\nare too far off to recognize its nature. Are these plains composed of\r\narid sand, as the first astronomer maintained? Or are they nothing but\r\nimmense forests, according to M. Warren de la Rue’s opinion, who gives\r\nthe moon an atmosphere, though a very low and a very dense one? That we\r\nshall know by and by. We must affirm nothing until we are in a position\r\nto do so.”\r\n\r\nThis “Sea of Clouds” is rather doubtfully marked out upon the maps. It\r\nis supposed that these vast plains are strewn with blocks of lava from\r\nthe neighboring volcanoes on its right, Ptolemy, Purbach, Arzachel. But\r\nthe projectile was advancing, and sensibly nearing it. Soon there\r\nappeared the heights which bound this sea at this northern limit.\r\nBefore them rose a mountain radiant with beauty, the top of which\r\nseemed lost in an eruption of solar rays.\r\n\r\n“That is—?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“Copernicus,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Let us see Copernicus.”\r\n\r\nThis mount, situated in 9° north latitude and 20° east longitude, rose\r\nto a height of 10,600 feet above the surface of the moon. It is quite\r\nvisible from the earth; and astronomers can study it with ease,\r\nparticularly during the phase between the last quarter and the new\r\nmoon, because then the shadows are thrown lengthways from east to west,\r\nallowing them to measure the heights.\r\n\r\nThis Copernicus forms the most important of the radiating system,\r\nsituated in the southern hemisphere, according to Tycho Brahé. It rises\r\nisolated like a gigantic lighthouse on that portion of the “Sea of\r\nClouds,” which is bounded by the “Sea of Tempests,” thus lighting by\r\nits splendid rays two oceans at a time. It was a sight without an\r\nequal, those long luminous trains, so dazzling in the full moon, and\r\nwhich, passing the boundary chain on the north, extends to the “Sea of\r\nRains.” At one o’clock of the terrestrial morning, the projectile, like\r\na balloon borne into space, overlooked the top of this superb mount.\r\nBarbicane could recognize perfectly its chief features. Copernicus is\r\ncomprised in the series of ringed mountains of the first order, in the\r\ndivision of great circles. Like Kepler and Aristarchus, which overlook\r\nthe “Ocean of Tempests,” sometimes it appeared like a brilliant point\r\nthrough the cloudy light, and was taken for a volcano in activity. But\r\nit is only an extinct one—like all on that side of the moon. Its\r\ncircumference showed a diameter of about twenty-two leagues. The\r\nglasses discovered traces of stratification produced by successive\r\neruptions, and the neighborhood was strewn with volcanic remains which\r\nstill choked some of the craters.\r\n\r\n“There exist,” said Barbicane, “several kinds of circles on the surface\r\nof the moon, and it is easy to see that Copernicus belongs to the\r\nradiating class. If we were nearer, we should see the cones bristling\r\non the inside, which in former times were so many fiery mouths. A\r\ncurious arrangement, and one without an exception on the lunar disc, is\r\nthat the interior surface of these circles is the reverse of the\r\nexterior, and contrary to the form taken by terrestrial craters. It\r\nfollows, then, that the general curve of the bottom of these circles\r\ngives a sphere of a smaller diameter than that of the moon.”\r\n\r\n“And why this peculiar disposition?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“We do not know,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“What splendid radiation!” said Michel. “One could hardly see a finer\r\nspectacle, I think.”\r\n\r\n“What would you say, then,” replied Barbicane, “if chance should bear\r\nus toward the southern hemisphere?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I should say that it was still more beautiful,” retorted Michel\r\nArdan.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the projectile hung perpendicularly over the circle. The\r\ncircumference of Copernicus formed almost a perfect circle, and its\r\nsteep escarpments were clearly defined. They could even distinguish a\r\nsecond ringed enclosure. Around spread a grayish plain, of a wild\r\naspect, on which every relief was marked in yellow. At the bottom of\r\nthe circle, as if enclosed in a jewel case, sparkled for one instant\r\ntwo or three eruptive cones, like enormous dazzling gems. Toward the\r\nnorth the escarpments were lowered by a depression which would probably\r\nhave given access to the interior of the crater.\r\n\r\nIn passing over the surrounding plains, Barbicane noticed a great\r\nnumber of less important mountains; and among others a little ringed\r\none called Guy Lussac, the breadth of which measured twelve miles.\r\n\r\nToward the south, the plain was very flat, without one elevation,\r\nwithout one projection. Toward the north, on the contrary, till where\r\nit was bounded by the “Sea of Storms,” it resembled a liquid surface\r\nagitated by a storm, of which the hills and hollows formed a succession\r\nof waves suddenly congealed. Over the whole of this, and in all\r\ndirections, lay the luminous lines, all converging to the summit of\r\nCopernicus.\r\n\r\nThe travelers discussed the origin of these strange rays; but they\r\ncould not determine their nature any more than terrestrial observers.\r\n\r\n“But why,” said Nicholl, “should not these rays be simply spurs of\r\nmountains which reflect more vividly the light of the sun?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Barbicane; “if it was so, under certain conditions of the\r\nmoon, these ridges would cast shadows, and they do not cast any.”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, these rays only appeared when the orb of day was in\r\nopposition to the moon, and disappeared as soon as its rays became\r\noblique.\r\n\r\n“But how have they endeavored to explain these lines of light?” asked\r\nMichel; “for I cannot believe that savants would ever be stranded for\r\nwant of an explanation.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Barbicane; “Herschel has put forward an opinion, but he\r\ndid not venture to affirm it.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind. What was the opinion?”\r\n\r\n“He thought that these rays might be streams of cooled lava which shone\r\nwhen the sun beat straight upon them. It may be so; but nothing can be\r\nless certain. Besides, if we pass nearer to Tycho, we shall be in a\r\nbetter position to find out the cause of this radiation.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my friends, what that plain, seen from the height we are\r\nat, resembles?” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Very well; with all those pieces of lava lengthened like rockets, it\r\nresembles an immense game of spelikans thrown pellmell. There wants but\r\nthe hook to pull them out one by one.”\r\n\r\n“Do be serious,” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Well, let us be serious,” replied Michel quietly; “and instead of\r\nspelikans, let us put bones. This plain, would then be nothing but an\r\nimmense cemetery, on which would repose the mortal remains of thousands\r\nof extinct generations. Do you prefer that high-flown comparison?”\r\n\r\n“One is as good as the other,” retorted Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“My word, you are difficult to please,” answered Michel.\r\n\r\n“My worthy friend,” continued the matter-of-fact Barbicane, “it matters\r\nbut little what it _resembles_, when we do not know what it _is_.”\r\n\r\n“Well answered,” exclaimed Michel. “That will teach me to reason with\r\nsavants.”\r\n\r\nBut the projectile continued to advance with almost uniform speed\r\naround the lunar disc. The travelers, we may easily imagine, did not\r\ndream of taking a moment’s rest. Every minute changed the landscape\r\nwhich fled from beneath their gaze. About half past one o’clock in the\r\nmorning, they caught a glimpse of the tops of another mountain.\r\nBarbicane, consulting his map, recognized Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\nIt was a ringed mountain nine thousand feet high, and one of those\r\ncircles so numerous on this satellite. With regard to this, Barbicane\r\nrelated Kepler’s singular opinion on the formation of circles.\r\nAccording to that celebrated mathematician, these crater-like cavities\r\nhad been dug by the hand of man.\r\n\r\n“For what purpose?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“For a very natural one,” replied Barbicane. “The Selenites might have\r\nundertaken these immense works and dug these enormous holes for a\r\nrefuge and shield from the solar rays which beat upon them during\r\nfifteen consecutive days.”\r\n\r\n“The Selenites are not fools,” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“A singular idea,” replied Nicholl; “but it is probable that Kepler did\r\nnot know the true dimensions of these circles, for the digging of them\r\nwould have been the work of giants quite impossible for the Selenites.”\r\n\r\n“Why? if weight on the moon’s surface is six times less than on the\r\nearth?” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“But if the Selenites are six times smaller?” retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“And if there are _no_ Selenites?” added Barbicane.\r\n\r\nThis put an end to the discussion.\r\n\r\nSoon Eratosthenes disappeared under the horizon without the projectile\r\nbeing sufficiently near to allow close observation. This mountain\r\nseparated the Apennines from the Carpathians. In the lunar orography\r\nthey have discerned some chains of mountains, which are chiefly\r\ndistributed over the northern hemisphere. Some, however, occupy certain\r\nportions of the southern hemisphere also.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock in the morning Barbicane found that they were above\r\nthe twentieth lunar parallel. The distance of the projectile from the\r\nmoon was not more than six hundred miles. Barbicane, now perceiving\r\nthat the projectile was steadily approaching the lunar disc, did not\r\ndespair; if not of reaching her, at least of discovering the secrets of\r\nher configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nLUNAR LANDSCAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past two in the morning, the projectile was over the thirteenth\r\nlunar parallel and at the effective distance of five hundred miles,\r\nreduced by the glasses to five. It still seemed impossible, however,\r\nthat it could ever touch any part of the disc. Its motive speed,\r\ncomparatively so moderate, was inexplicable to President Barbicane. At\r\nthat distance from the moon it must have been considerable, to enable\r\nit to bear up against her attraction. Here was a phenomenon the cause\r\nof which escaped them again. Besides, time failed them to investigate\r\nthe cause. All lunar relief was defiling under the eyes of the\r\ntravelers, and they would not lose a single detail.\r\n\r\nUnder the glasses the disc appeared at the distance of five miles. What\r\nwould an aeronaut, borne to this distance from the earth, distinguish\r\non its surface? We cannot say, since the greatest ascension has not\r\nbeen more than 25,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is an exact description of what Barbicane and his\r\ncompanions saw at this height. Large patches of different colors\r\nappeared on the disc. Selenographers are not agreed upon the nature of\r\nthese colors. There are several, and rather vividly marked. Julius\r\nSchmidt pretends that, if the terrestrial oceans were dried up, a\r\nSelenite observer could not distinguish on the globe a greater\r\ndiversity of shades between the oceans and the continental plains than\r\nthose on the moon present to a terrestrial observer. According to him,\r\nthe color common to the vast plains known by the name of “seas” is a\r\ndark gray mixed with green and brown. Some of the large craters present\r\nthe same appearance. Barbicane knew this opinion of the German\r\nselenographer, an opinion shared by Boeer and Moedler. Observation has\r\nproved that right was on their side, and not on that of some\r\nastronomers who admit the existence of only gray on the moon’s surface.\r\nIn some parts green was very distinct, such as springs, according to\r\nJulius Schmidt, from the seas of “Serenity and Humors.” Barbicane also\r\nnoticed large craters, without any interior cones, which shed a bluish\r\ntint similar to the reflection of a sheet of steel freshly polished.\r\nThese colors belonged really to the lunar disc, and did not result, as\r\nsome astronomers say, either from the imperfection in the objective of\r\nthe glasses or from the interposition of the terrestrial atmosphere.\r\n\r\nNot a doubt existed in Barbicane’s mind with regard to it, as he\r\nobserved it through space, and so could not commit any optical error.\r\nHe considered the establishment of this fact as an acquisition to\r\nscience. Now, were these shades of green, belonging to tropical\r\nvegetation, kept up by a low dense atmosphere? He could not yet say.\r\n\r\nFarther on, he noticed a reddish tint, quite defined. The same shade\r\nhad before been observed at the bottom of an isolated enclosure, known\r\nby the name of Lichtenburg’s circle, which is situated near the\r\nHercynian mountains, on the borders of the moon; but they could not\r\ntell the nature of it.\r\n\r\nThey were not more fortunate with regard to another peculiarity of the\r\ndisc, for they could not decide upon the cause of it.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan was watching near the president, when he noticed long\r\nwhite lines, vividly lighted up by the direct rays of the sun. It was a\r\nsuccession of luminous furrows, very different from the radiation of\r\nCopernicus not long before; they ran parallel with each other.\r\n\r\nMichel, with his usual readiness, hastened to exclaim:\r\n\r\n“Look there! cultivated fields!”\r\n\r\n“Cultivated fields!” replied Nicholl, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Plowed, at all events,” retorted Michel Ardan; “but what laborers\r\nthose Selenites must be, and what giant oxen they must harness to their\r\nplow to cut such furrows!”\r\n\r\n“They are not furrows,” said Barbicane; “they are _rifts_.”\r\n\r\n“Rifts? stuff!” replied Michel mildly; “but what do you mean by ‘rifts’\r\nin the scientific world?”\r\n\r\nBarbicane immediately enlightened his companion as to what he knew\r\nabout lunar rifts. He knew that they were a kind of furrow found on\r\nevery part of the disc which was not mountainous; that these furrows,\r\ngenerally isolated, measured from 400 to 500 leagues in length; that\r\ntheir breadth varied from 1,000 to 1,500 yards, and that their borders\r\nwere strictly parallel; but he knew nothing more either of their\r\nformation or their nature.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, through his glasses, observed these rifts with great\r\nattention. He noticed that their borders were formed of steep\r\ndeclivities; they were long parallel ramparts, and with some small\r\namount of imagination he might have admitted the existence of long\r\nlines of fortifications, raised by Selenite engineers. Of these\r\ndifferent rifts some were perfectly straight, as if cut by a line;\r\nothers were slightly curved, though still keeping their borders\r\nparallel; some crossed each other, some cut through craters; here they\r\nwound through ordinary cavities, such as Posidonius or Petavius; there\r\nthey wound through the seas, such as the “Sea of Serenity.”\r\n\r\nThese natural accidents naturally excited the imaginations of these\r\nterrestrial astronomers. The first observations had not discovered\r\nthese rifts. Neither Hévelius, Cassin, La Hire, nor Herschel seemed to\r\nhave known them. It was Schroeter who in 1789 first drew attention to\r\nthem. Others followed who studied them, as Pastorff, Gruithuysen,\r\nBoeer, and Moedler. At this time their number amounts to seventy; but,\r\nif they have been counted, their nature has not yet been determined;\r\nthey are certainly _not_ fortifications, any more than they are the\r\nancient beds of dried-up rivers; for, on one side, the waters, so\r\nslight on the moon’s surface, could never have worn such drains for\r\nthemselves; and, on the other, they often cross craters of great\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, allow that Michel Ardan had “an idea,” and that,\r\nwithout knowing it, he coincided in that respect with Julius Schmidt.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said he, “should not these unaccountable appearances be simply\r\nphenomena of vegetation?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Barbicane quickly.\r\n\r\n“Do not excite yourself, my worthy president,” replied Michel; “might\r\nit not be possible that the dark lines forming that bastion were rows\r\nof trees regularly placed?”\r\n\r\n“You stick to your vegetation, then?” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“I like,” retorted Michel Ardan, “to explain what you savants cannot\r\nexplain; at least my hypotheses has the advantage of indicating why\r\nthese rifts disappear, or seem to disappear, at certain seasons.”\r\n\r\n“And for what reason?”\r\n\r\n“For the reason that the trees become invisible when they lose their\r\nleaves, and visible again when they regain them.”\r\n\r\n“Your explanation is ingenious, my dear companion,” replied Barbicane,\r\n“but inadmissible.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because, so to speak, there are no seasons on the moon’s surface, and\r\nthat, consequently, the phenomena of vegetation of which you speak\r\ncannot occur.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the slight obliquity of the lunar axis keeps the sun at an\r\nalmost equal height in every latitude. Above the equatorial regions the\r\nradiant orb almost invariably occupies the zenith, and does not pass\r\nthe limits of the horizon in the polar regions; thus, according to each\r\nregion, there reigns a perpetual winter, spring, summer, or autumn, as\r\nin the planet Jupiter, whose axis is but little inclined upon its\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nWhat origin do they attribute to these rifts? That is a question\r\ndifficult to solve. They are certainly anterior to the formation of\r\ncraters and circles, for several have introduced themselves by breaking\r\nthrough their circular ramparts. Thus it may be that, contemporary with\r\nthe later geological epochs, they are due to the expansion of natural\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile had now attained the fortieth degree of lunar\r\nlatitude, at a distance not exceeding 40 miles. Through the glasses\r\nobjects appeared to be only four miles distant.\r\n\r\nAt this point, under their feet, rose Mount Helicon, 1,520 feet high,\r\nand round about the left rose moderate elevations, enclosing a small\r\nportion of the “Sea of Rains,” under the name of the Gulf of Iris. The\r\nterrestrial atmosphere would have to be one hundred and seventy times\r\nmore transparent than it is, to allow astronomers to make perfect\r\nobservations on the moon’s surface; but in the void in which the\r\nprojectile floated no fluid interposed itself between the eye of the\r\nobserver and the object observed. And more, Barbicane found himself\r\ncarried to a greater distance than the most powerful telescopes had\r\never done before, either that of Lord Rosse or that of the Rocky\r\nMountains. He was, therefore, under extremely favorable conditions for\r\nsolving that great question of the habitability of the moon; but the\r\nsolution still escaped him; he could distinguish nothing but desert\r\nbeds, immense plains, and toward the north, arid mountains. Not a work\r\nbetrayed the hand of man; not a ruin marked his course; not a group of\r\nanimals was to be seen indicating life, even in an inferior degree. In\r\nno part was there life, in no part was there an appearance of\r\nvegetation. Of the three kingdoms which share the terrestrial globe\r\nbetween them, one alone was represented on the lunar and that the\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed!” said Michel Ardan, a little out of countenance; “then you\r\nsee no one?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Nicholl; “up to this time, not a man, not an animal, not\r\na tree! After all, whether the atmosphere has taken refuge at the\r\nbottom of cavities, in the midst of the circles, or even on the\r\nopposite face of the moon, we cannot decide.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added Barbicane, “even to the most piercing eye a man cannot\r\nbe distinguished farther than three and a half miles off; so that, if\r\nthere are any Selenites, they can see our projectile, but we cannot see\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nToward four in the morning, at the height of the fiftieth parallel, the\r\ndistance was reduced to 300 miles. To the left ran a line of mountains\r\ncapriciously shaped, lying in the full light. To the right, on the\r\ncontrary, lay a black hollow resembling a vast well, unfathomable and\r\ngloomy, drilled into the lunar soil.\r\n\r\nThis hole was the “Black Lake”; it was Pluto, a deep circle which can\r\nbe conveniently studied from the earth, between the last quarter and\r\nthe new moon, when the shadows fall from west to east.\r\n\r\nThis black color is rarely met with on the surface of the satellite. As\r\nyet it has only been recognized in the depths of the circle of\r\nEndymion, to the east of the “Cold Sea,” in the northern hemisphere,\r\nand at the bottom of Grimaldi’s circle, on the equator, toward the\r\neastern border of the orb.\r\n\r\nPluto is an annular mountain, situated in 51° north latitude, and 9°\r\neast longitude. Its circuit is forty-seven miles long and thirty-two\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nBarbicane regretted that they were not passing directly above this vast\r\nopening. There was an abyss to fathom, perhaps some mysterious\r\nphenomenon to surprise; but the projectile’s course could not be\r\naltered. They must rigidly submit. They could not guide a balloon,\r\nstill less a projectile, when once enclosed within its walls. Toward\r\nfive in the morning the northern limits of the “Sea of Rains” was at\r\nlength passed. The mounts of Condamine and Fontenelle remained—one on\r\nthe right, the other on the left. That part of the disc beginning with\r\n60° was becoming quite mountainous. The glasses brought them to within\r\ntwo miles, less than that separating the summit of Mont Blanc from the\r\nlevel of the sea. The whole region was bristling with spikes and\r\ncircles. Toward the 60° Philolaus stood predominant at a height of\r\n5,550 feet with its elliptical crater, and seen from this distance, the\r\ndisc showed a very fantastical appearance. Landscapes were presented to\r\nthe eye under very different conditions from those on the earth, and\r\nalso very inferior to them.\r\n\r\nThe moon having no atmosphere, the consequences arising from the\r\nabsence of this gaseous envelope have already been shown. No twilight\r\non her surface; night following day and day following night with the\r\nsuddenness of a lamp which is extinguished or lighted amid profound\r\ndarkness—no transition from cold to heat, the temperature falling in an\r\ninstant from boiling point to the cold of space.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of this want of air is that absolute darkness\r\nreigns where the sun’s rays do not penetrate. That which on earth is\r\ncalled diffusion of light, that luminous matter which the air holds in\r\nsuspension, which creates the twilight and the daybreak, which produces\r\nthe _umbrae_ and _penumbrae_, and all the magic of _chiaro-oscuro_,\r\ndoes not exist on the moon. Hence the harshness of contrasts, which\r\nonly admit of two colors, black and white. If a Selenite were to shade\r\nhis eyes from the sun’s rays, the sky would seem absolutely black, and\r\nthe stars would shine to him as on the darkest night. Judge of the\r\nimpression produced on Barbicane and his three friends by this strange\r\nscene! Their eyes were confused. They could no longer grasp the\r\nrespective distances of the different plains. A lunar landscape without\r\nthe softening of the phenomena of _chiaro-oscuro_ could not be rendered\r\nby an earthly landscape painter; it would be spots of ink on a white\r\npage—nothing more.\r\n\r\nThis aspect was not altered even when the projectile, at the height of\r\n80°, was only separated from the moon by a distance of fifty miles; nor\r\neven when, at five in the morning, it passed at less than twenty-five\r\nmiles from the mountain of Gioja, a distance reduced by the glasses to\r\na quarter of a mile. It seemed as if the moon might be touched by the\r\nhand! It seemed impossible that, before long, the projectile would not\r\nstrike her, if only at the north pole, the brilliant arch of which was\r\nso distinctly visible on the black sky.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan wanted to open one of the scuttles and throw himself on to\r\nthe moon’s surface! A very useless attempt; for if the projectile could\r\nnot attain any point whatever of the satellite, Michel, carried along\r\nby its motion, could not attain it either.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, at six o’clock, the lunar pole appeared. The disc only\r\npresented to the travelers’ gaze one half brilliantly lit up, while the\r\nother disappeared in the darkness. Suddenly the projectile passed the\r\nline of demarcation between intense light and absolute darkness, and\r\nwas plunged in profound night!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nTHE NIGHT OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR HOURS AND A HALF\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when this phenomenon took place so rapidly, the\r\nprojectile was skirting the moon’s north pole at less than twenty-five\r\nmiles distance. Some seconds had sufficed to plunge it into the\r\nabsolute darkness of space. The transition was so sudden, without\r\nshade, without gradation of light, without attenuation of the luminous\r\nwaves, that the orb seemed to have been extinguished by a powerful\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n“Melted, disappeared!” Michel Ardan exclaimed, aghast.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was neither reflection nor shadow. Nothing more was to be\r\nseen of that disc, formerly so dazzling. The darkness was complete. and\r\nrendered even more so by the rays from the stars. It was “that\r\nblackness” in which the lunar nights are insteeped, which last three\r\nhundred and fifty-four hours and a half at each point of the disc, a\r\nlong night resulting from the equality of the translatory and rotary\r\nmovements of the moon. The projectile, immerged in the conical shadow\r\nof the satellite, experienced the action of the solar rays no more than\r\nany of its invisible points.\r\n\r\nIn the interior, the obscurity was complete. They could not see each\r\nother. Hence the necessity of dispelling the darkness. However desirous\r\nBarbicane might be to husband the gas, the reserve of which was small,\r\nhe was obliged to ask from it a fictitious light, an expensive\r\nbrilliancy which the sun then refused.\r\n\r\n“Devil take the radiant orb!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “which forces us\r\nto expend gas, instead of giving us his rays gratuitously.”\r\n\r\n“Do not let us accuse the sun,” said Nicholl, “it is not his fault, but\r\nthat of the moon, which has come and placed herself like a screen\r\nbetween us and it.”\r\n\r\n“It is the sun!” continued Michel.\r\n\r\n“It is the moon!” retorted Nicholl.\r\n\r\nAn idle dispute, which Barbicane put an end to by saying:\r\n\r\n“My friends, it is neither the fault of the sun nor of the moon; it is\r\nthe fault of the _projectile_, which, instead of rigidly following its\r\ncourse, has awkwardly missed it. To be more just, it is the fault of\r\nthat unfortunate meteor which has so deplorably altered our first\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied Michel Ardan, “as the matter is settled, let us have\r\nbreakfast. After a whole night of watching it is fair to build\r\nourselves up a little.”\r\n\r\nThis proposal meeting with no contradiction, Michel prepared the repast\r\nin a few minutes. But they ate for eating’s sake, they drank without\r\ntoasts, without hurrahs. The bold travelers being borne away into\r\ngloomy space, without their accustomed _cortege_ of rays, felt a vague\r\nuneasiness in their hearts. The “strange” shadow so dear to Victor\r\nHugo’s pen bound them on all sides. But they talked over the\r\ninterminable night of three hundred and fifty-four hours and a half,\r\nnearly fifteen days, which the law of physics has imposed on the\r\ninhabitants of the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane gave his friends some explanation of the causes and the\r\nconsequences of this curious phenomenon.\r\n\r\n“Curious indeed,” said they; “for, if each hemisphere of the moon is\r\ndeprived of solar light for fifteen days, that above which we now float\r\ndoes not even enjoy during its long night any view of the earth so\r\nbeautifully lit up. In a word she has no moon (applying this\r\ndesignation to our globe) but on one side of her disc. Now if this were\r\nthe case with the earth—if, for example, Europe never saw the moon, and\r\nshe was only visible at the antipodes, imagine to yourself the\r\nastonishment of a European on arriving in Australia.”\r\n\r\n“They would make the voyage for nothing but to see the moon!” replied\r\nMichel.\r\n\r\n“Very well!” continued Barbicane, “that astonishment is reserved for\r\nthe Selenites who inhabit the face of the moon opposite to the earth, a\r\nface which is ever invisible to our countrymen of the terrestrial\r\nglobe.”\r\n\r\n“And which we should have seen,” added Nicholl, “if we had arrived here\r\nwhen the moon was new, that is to say fifteen days later.”\r\n\r\n“I will add, to make amends,” continued Barbicane, “that the\r\ninhabitants of the visible face are singularly favored by nature, to\r\nthe detriment of their brethren on the invisible face. The latter, as\r\nyou see, have dark nights of 354 hours, without one single ray to break\r\nthe darkness. The other, on the contrary, when the sun which has given\r\nits light for fifteen days sinks below the horizon, see a splendid orb\r\nrise on the opposite horizon. It is the earth, which is thirteen times\r\ngreater than the diminutive moon that we know—the earth which developes\r\nitself at a diameter of two degrees, and which sheds a light thirteen\r\ntimes greater than that qualified by atmospheric strata—the earth which\r\nonly disappears at the moment when the sun reappears in its turn!”\r\n\r\n“Nicely worded!” said Michel, “slightly academical perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“It follows, then,” continued Barbicane, without knitting his brows,\r\n“that the visible face of the disc must be very agreeable to inhabit,\r\nsince it always looks on either the sun when the moon is full, or on\r\nthe earth when the moon is new.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Nicholl, “that advantage must be well compensated by the\r\ninsupportable heat which the light brings with it.”\r\n\r\n“The inconvenience, in that respect, is the same for the two faces, for\r\nthe earth’s light is evidently deprived of heat. But the invisible face\r\nis still more searched by the heat than the visible face. I say that\r\nfor _you_, Nicholl, because Michel will probably not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” continued Barbicane, “when the invisible face receives at the\r\nsame time light and heat from the sun, it is because the moon is new;\r\nthat is to say, she is situated between the sun and the earth. It\r\nfollows, then, considering the position which she occupies in\r\nopposition when full, that she is nearer to the sun by twice her\r\ndistance from the earth; and that distance may be estimated at the\r\ntwo-hundredth part of that which separates the sun from the earth, or\r\nin round numbers 400,000 miles. So that invisible face is so much\r\nnearer to the sun when she receives its rays.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” continued Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“One moment,” said Michel, interrupting his grave companion.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“I ask to be allowed to continue the explanation.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“To prove that I understand.”\r\n\r\n“Get along with you,” said Barbicane, smiling.\r\n\r\n“On the contrary,” said Michel, imitating the tone and gestures of the\r\npresident, “on the contrary, when the visible face of the moon is lit\r\nby the sun, it is because the moon is full, that is to say, opposite\r\nthe sun with regard to the earth. The distance separating it from the\r\nradiant orb is then increased in round numbers to 400,000 miles, and\r\nthe heat which she receives must be a little less.”\r\n\r\n“Very well said!” exclaimed Barbicane. “Do you know, Michel, that, for\r\nan amateur, you are intelligent.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Michel coolly, “we are all so on the Boulevard des\r\nItaliens.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane gravely grasped the hand of his amiable companion, and\r\ncontinued to enumerate the advantages reserved for the inhabitants of\r\nthe visible face.\r\n\r\nAmong others, he mentioned eclipses of the sun, which only take place\r\non this side of the lunar disc; since, in order that they may take\r\nplace, it is necessary for the moon to be _in opposition_. These\r\neclipses, caused by the interposition of the earth between the moon and\r\nthe sun, can last _two hours_; during which time, by reason of the rays\r\nrefracted by its atmosphere, the terrestrial globe can appear as\r\nnothing but a black point upon the sun.\r\n\r\n“So,” said Nicholl, “there is a hemisphere, that invisible hemisphere\r\nwhich is very ill supplied, very ill treated, by nature.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” replied Michel; “if we ever become Selenites, we will\r\ninhabit the visible face. I like the light.”\r\n\r\n“Unless, by any chance,” answered Nicholl, “the atmosphere should be\r\ncondensed on the other side, as certain astronomers pretend.”\r\n\r\n“That would be a consideration,” said Michel.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the observers returned to their post. They tried to see\r\nthrough the darkened scuttles by extinguishing all light in the\r\nprojectile; but not a luminous spark made its way through the darkness.\r\n\r\nOne inexplicable fact preoccupied Barbicane. Why, having passed within\r\nsuch a short distance of the moon—about twenty-five miles only—why the\r\nprojectile had not fallen? If its speed had been enormous, he could\r\nhave understood that the fall would not have taken place; but, with a\r\nrelatively moderate speed, that resistance to the moon’s attraction\r\ncould not be explained. Was the projectile under some foreign\r\ninfluence? Did some kind of body retain it in the ether? It was quite\r\nevident that it could never reach any point of the moon. Whither was it\r\ngoing? Was it going farther from, or nearing, the disc? Was it being\r\nborne in that profound darkness through the infinity of space? How\r\ncould they learn, how calculate, in the midst of this night? All these\r\nquestions made Barbicane uneasy, but he could not solve them.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the invisible orb was _there_, perhaps only some few miles\r\noff; but neither he nor his companions could see it. If there was any\r\nnoise on its surface, they could not hear it. Air, that medium of\r\nsound, was wanting to transmit the groanings of that moon which the\r\nArabic legends call “a man already half granite, and still breathing.”\r\n\r\nOne must allow that that was enough to aggravate the most patient\r\nobservers. It was just that unknown hemisphere which was stealing from\r\ntheir sight. That face which fifteen days sooner, or fifteen days\r\nlater, had been, or would be, splendidly illuminated by the solar rays,\r\nwas then being lost in utter darkness. In fifteen days where would the\r\nprojectile be? Who could say? Where would the chances of conflicting\r\nattractions have drawn it to? The disappointment of the travelers in\r\nthe midst of this utter darkness may be imagined. All observation of\r\nthe lunar disc was impossible. The constellations alone claimed all\r\ntheir attention; and we must allow that the astronomers Faye,\r\nCharconac, and Secchi, never found themselves in circumstances so\r\nfavorable for their observation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nothing could equal the splendor of this starry world, bathed\r\nin limpid ether. Its diamonds set in the heavenly vault sparkled\r\nmagnificently. The eye took in the firmament from the Southern Cross to\r\nthe North Star, those two constellations which in 12,000 years, by\r\nreason of the succession of equinoxes, will resign their part of the\r\npolar stars, the one to Canopus in the southern hemisphere, the other\r\nto Wega in the northern. Imagination loses itself in this sublime\r\nInfinity, amid which the projectile was gravitating, like a new star\r\ncreated by the hand of man. From a natural cause, these constellations\r\nshone with a soft luster; they did not twinkle, for there was no\r\natmosphere which, by the intervention of its layers unequally dense and\r\nof different degrees of humidity, produces this scintillation. These\r\nstars were soft eyes, looking out into the dark night, amid the silence\r\nof absolute space.\r\n\r\nLong did the travelers stand mute, watching the constellated firmament,\r\nupon which the moon, like a vast screen, made an enormous black hole.\r\nBut at length a painful sensation drew them from their watchings. This\r\nwas an intense cold, which soon covered the inside of the glass of the\r\nscuttles with a thick coating of ice. The sun was no longer warming the\r\nprojectile with its direct rays, and thus it was losing the heat stored\r\nup in its walls by degrees. This heat was rapidly evaporating into\r\nspace by radiation, and a considerably lower temperature was the\r\nresult. The humidity of the interior was changed into ice upon contact\r\nwith the glass, preventing all observation.\r\n\r\nNicholl consulted the thermometer, and saw that it had fallen to\r\nseventeen degrees (Centigrade) below zero.[3] So that, in spite of the\r\nmany reasons for economizing, Barbicane, after having begged light from\r\nthe gas, was also obliged to beg for heat. The projectile’s low\r\ntemperature was no longer endurable. Its tenants would have been frozen\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n [3] 1° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well!” observed Michel, “we cannot reasonably complain of the monotony\r\nof our journey! What variety we have had, at least in temperature. Now\r\nwe are blinded with light and saturated with heat, like the Indians of\r\nthe Pampas! now plunged into profound darkness, amid the cold, like the\r\nEsquimaux of the north pole. No, indeed! we have no right to complain;\r\nnature does wonders in our honor.”\r\n\r\n“But,” asked Nicholl, “what is the temperature outside?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly that of the planetary space,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Michel Ardan, “would not this be the time to make the\r\nexperiment which we dared not attempt when we were drowned in the sun’s\r\nrays?\r\n\r\n“It is now or never,” replied Barbicane, “for we are in a good position\r\nto verify the temperature of space, and see if Fourier or Pouillet’s\r\ncalculations are exact.”\r\n\r\n“In any case it is cold,” said Michel. “See! the steam of the interior\r\nis condensing on the glasses of the scuttles. If the fall continues,\r\nthe vapor of our breath will fall in snow around us.”\r\n\r\n“Let us prepare a thermometer,” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine that an ordinary thermometer would afford no result\r\nunder the circumstances in which this instrument was to be exposed. The\r\nmercury would have been frozen in its ball, as below 42° Fahrenheit\r\nbelow zero it is no longer liquid. But Barbicane had furnished himself\r\nwith a spirit thermometer on Wafferdin’s system, which gives the minima\r\nof excessively low temperatures.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the experiment, this instrument was compared with an\r\nordinary one, and then Barbicane prepared to use it.\r\n\r\n“How shall we set about it?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier,” replied Michel Ardan, who was never at a loss. “We\r\nopen the scuttle rapidly; throw out the instrument; it follows the\r\nprojectile with exemplary docility; and a quarter of an hour after,\r\ndraw it in.”\r\n\r\n“With the hand?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“With the hand,” replied Michel.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, my friend, do not expose yourself,” answered Barbicane,\r\n“for the hand that you draw in again will be nothing but a stump frozen\r\nand deformed by the frightful cold.”\r\n\r\n“Really!”\r\n\r\n“You will feel as if you had had a terrible burn, like that of iron at\r\na white heat; for whether the heat leaves our bodies briskly or enters\r\nbriskly, it is exactly the same thing. Besides, I am not at all certain\r\nthat the objects we have thrown out are still following us.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Because, if we are passing through an atmosphere of the slightest\r\ndensity, these objects will be retarded. Again, the darkness prevents\r\nour seeing if they still float around us. But in order not to expose\r\nourselves to the loss of our thermometer, we will fasten it, and we can\r\nthen more easily pull it back again.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane’s advice was followed. Through the scuttle rapidly opened,\r\nNicholl threw out the instrument, which was held by a short cord, so\r\nthat it might be more easily drawn up. The scuttle had not been opened\r\nmore than a second, but that second had sufficed to let in a most\r\nintense cold.\r\n\r\n“The devil!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “it is cold enough to freeze a\r\nwhite bear.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane waited until half an hour had elapsed, which was more than\r\ntime enough to allow the instrument to fall to the level of the\r\nsurrounding temperature. Then it was rapidly pulled in.\r\n\r\nBarbicane calculated the quantity of spirits of wine overflowed into\r\nthe little vial soldered to the lower part of the instrument, and said:\r\n\r\n“A hundred and forty degrees Centigrade[4] below zero!”\r\n\r\n [4] 218 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Pouillet was right and Fourier wrong. That was the undoubted\r\ntemperature of the starry space. Such is, perhaps, that of the lunar\r\ncontinents, when the orb of night has lost by radiation all the heat\r\nwhich fifteen days of sun have poured into her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nHYPERBOLA OR PARABOLA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may, perhaps, be astonished to find Barbicane and his companions so\r\nlittle occupied with the future reserved for them in their metal prison\r\nwhich was bearing them through the infinity of space. Instead of asking\r\nwhere they were going, they passed their time making experiments, as if\r\nthey had been quietly installed in their own study.\r\n\r\nWe might answer that men so strong-minded were above such\r\nanxieties—that they did not trouble themselves about such trifles—and\r\nthat they had something else to do than to occupy their minds with the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe truth was that they were not masters of their projectile; they\r\ncould neither check its course, nor alter its direction.\r\n\r\nA sailor can change the head of his ship as he pleases; an aeronaut can\r\ngive a vertical motion to his balloon. They, on the contrary, had no\r\npower over their vehicle. Every maneuver was forbidden. Hence the\r\ninclination to let things alone, or as the sailors say, “let her run.”\r\n\r\nWhere did they find themselves at this moment, at eight o’clock in the\r\nmorning of the day called upon the earth the 6th of December? Very\r\ncertainly in the neighborhood of the moon, and even near enough for her\r\nto look to them like an enormous black screen upon the firmament. As to\r\nthe distance which separated them, it was impossible to estimate it.\r\nThe projectile, held by some unaccountable force, had been within four\r\nmiles of grazing the satellite’s north pole.\r\n\r\nBut since entering the cone of shadow these last two hours, had the\r\ndistance increased or diminished? Every point of mark was wanting by\r\nwhich to estimate both the direction and the speed of the projectile.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was rapidly leaving the disc, so that it would soon quit the\r\npure shadow. Perhaps, again, on the other hand, it might be nearing it\r\nso much that in a short time it might strike some high point on the\r\ninvisible hemisphere, which would doubtlessly have ended the journey\r\nmuch to the detriment of the travelers.\r\n\r\nA discussion arose on this subject, and Michel Ardan, always ready with\r\nan explanation, gave it as his opinion that the projectile, held by the\r\nlunar attraction, would end by falling on the surface of the\r\nterrestrial globe like an aerolite.\r\n\r\n“First of all, my friend,” answered Barbicane, “every aerolite does not\r\nfall to the earth; it is only a small proportion which do so; and if we\r\nhad passed into an aerolite, it does not necessarily follow that we\r\nshould ever reach the surface of the moon.”\r\n\r\n“But how if we get near enough?” replied Michel.\r\n\r\n“Pure mistake,” replied Barbicane. “Have you not seen shooting stars\r\nrush through the sky by thousands at certain seasons?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, these stars, or rather corpuscles, only shine when they are\r\nheated by gliding over the atmospheric layers. Now, if they enter the\r\natmosphere, they pass at least within forty miles of the earth, but\r\nthey seldom fall upon it. The same with our projectile. It may approach\r\nvery near to the moon, and not yet fall upon it.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” asked Michel, “I shall be curious to know how our erring\r\nvehicle will act in space?”\r\n\r\n“I see but two hypotheses,” replied Barbicane, after some moments’\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\n“What are they?”\r\n\r\n“The projectile has the choice between two mathematical curves, and it\r\nwill follow one or the other according to the speed with which it is\r\nanimated, and which at this moment I cannot estimate.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Nicholl, “it will follow either a parabola or a hyperbola.”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied Barbicane. “With a certain speed it will assume the\r\nparabola, and with a greater the hyperbola.”\r\n\r\n“I like those grand words,” exclaimed Michel Ardan; “one knows directly\r\nwhat they mean. And pray what is your parabola, if you please?”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” answered the captain, “the parabola is a curve of the\r\nsecond order, the result of the section of a cone intersected by a\r\nplane parallel to one of the sides.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah!” said Michel, in a satisfied tone.\r\n\r\n“It is very nearly,” continued Nicholl, “the course described by a bomb\r\nlaunched from a mortar.”\r\n\r\n“Perfect! And the hyperbola?”\r\n\r\n“The hyperbola, Michel, is a curve of the second order, produced by the\r\nintersection of a conic surface and a plane parallel to its axis, and\r\nconstitutes two branches separated one from the other, both tending\r\nindefinitely in the two directions.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible!” exclaimed Michel Ardan in a serious tone, as if they\r\nhad told him of some serious event. “What I particularly like in your\r\ndefinition of the hyperbola (I was going to say hyperblague) is that it\r\nis still more obscure than the word you pretend to define.”\r\n\r\nNicholl and Barbicane cared little for Michel Ardan’s fun. They were\r\ndeep in a scientific discussion. What curve would the projectile\r\nfollow? was their hobby. One maintained the hyperbola, the other the\r\nparabola. They gave each other reasons bristling with _x_. Their\r\narguments were couched in language which made Michel jump. The\r\ndiscussion was hot, and neither would give up his chosen curve to his\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nThis scientific dispute lasted so long that it made Michel very\r\nimpatient.\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen cosines, will you cease to throw parabolas and\r\nhyperbolas at each other’s heads? I want to understand the only\r\ninteresting question in the whole affair. We shall follow one or the\r\nother of these curves? Good. But where will they lead us to?”\r\n\r\n“Nowhere,” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“How, nowhere?”\r\n\r\n“Evidently,” said Barbicane, “they are open curves, which may be\r\nprolonged indefinitely.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, savants!” cried Michel; “and what are either the one or the other\r\nto us from the moment we know that they equally lead us into infinite\r\nspace?”\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not forbear smiling. They had just been\r\ncreating “art for art’s sake.” Never had so idle a question been raised\r\nat such an inopportune moment. The sinister truth remained that,\r\nwhether hyperbolically or parabolically borne away, the projectile\r\nwould never again meet either the earth or the moon.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of these bold travelers in the immediate future? If\r\nthey did not die of hunger, if they did not die of thirst, in some\r\ndays, when the gas failed, they would die from want of air, unless the\r\ncold had killed them first. Still, important as it was to economize the\r\ngas, the excessive lowness of the surrounding temperature obliged them\r\nto consume a certain quantity. Strictly speaking, they could do without\r\nits _light_, but not without its _heat_. Fortunately the caloric\r\ngenerated by Reiset’s and Regnaut’s apparatus raised the temperature of\r\nthe interior of the projectile a little, and without much expenditure\r\nthey were able to keep it bearable.\r\n\r\nBut observations had now become very difficult. the dampness of the\r\nprojectile was condensed on the windows and congealed immediately. This\r\ncloudiness had to be dispersed continually. In any case they might hope\r\nto be able to discover some phenomena of the highest interest.\r\n\r\nBut up to this time the disc remained dumb and dark. It did not answer\r\nthe multiplicity of questions put by these ardent minds; a matter which\r\ndrew this reflection from Michel, apparently a just one:\r\n\r\n“If ever we begin this journey over again, we shall do well to choose\r\nthe time when the moon is at the full.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Nicholl, “that circumstance will be more favorable. I\r\nallow that the moon, immersed in the sun’s rays, will not be visible\r\nduring the transit, but instead we should see the earth, which would be\r\nfull. And what is more, if we were drawn round the moon, as at this\r\nmoment, we should at least have the advantage of seeing the invisible\r\npart of her disc magnificently lit.”\r\n\r\n“Well said, Nicholl,” replied Michel Ardan. “What do you think,\r\nBarbicane?”\r\n\r\n“I think this,” answered the grave president: “If ever we begin this\r\njourney again, we shall start at the same time and under the same\r\nconditions. Suppose we had attained our end, would it not have been\r\nbetter to have found continents in broad daylight than a country\r\nplunged in utter darkness? Would not our first installation have been\r\nmade under better circumstances? Yes, evidently. As to the invisible\r\nside, we could have visited it in our exploring expeditions on the\r\nlunar globe. So that the time of the full moon was well chosen. But we\r\nought to have arrived at the end; and in order to have so arrived, we\r\nought to have suffered no deviation on the road.”\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to say to that,” answered Michel Ardan. “Here is,\r\nhowever, a good opportunity lost of observing the other side of the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\nBut the projectile was now describing in the shadow that incalculable\r\ncourse which no sight-mark would allow them to ascertain. Had its\r\ndirection been altered, either by the influence of the lunar\r\nattraction, or by the action of some unknown star? Barbicane could not\r\nsay. But a change had taken place in the relative position of the\r\nvehicle; and Barbicane verified it about four in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe change consisted in this, that the base of the projectile had\r\nturned toward the moon’s surface, and was so held by a perpendicular\r\npassing through its axis. The attraction, that is to say the weight,\r\nhad brought about this alteration. The heaviest part of the projectile\r\ninclined toward the invisible disc as if it would fall upon it.\r\n\r\nWas it falling? Were the travelers attaining that much desired end? No.\r\nAnd the observation of a sign-point, quite inexplicable in itself,\r\nshowed Barbicane that his projectile was not nearing the moon, and that\r\nit had shifted by following an almost concentric curve.\r\n\r\nThis point of mark was a luminous brightness, which Nicholl sighted\r\nsuddenly, on the limit of the horizon formed by the black disc. This\r\npoint could not be confounded with a star. It was a reddish\r\nincandescence which increased by degrees, a decided proof that the\r\nprojectile was shifting toward it and not falling normally on the\r\nsurface of the moon.\r\n\r\n“A volcano! it is a volcano in action!” cried Nicholl; “a disemboweling\r\nof the interior fires of the moon! That world is not quite\r\nextinguished.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, an eruption,” replied Barbicane, who was carefully studying the\r\nphenomenon through his night glass. “What should it be, if not a\r\nvolcano?”\r\n\r\n“But, then,” said Michel Ardan, “in order to maintain that combustion,\r\nthere must be air. So the atmosphere does surround that part of the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” replied Barbicane, “but not necessarily.\r\n\r\nThe volcano, by the decomposition of certain substances, can provide\r\nits own oxygen, and thus throw flames into space. It seems to me that\r\nthe deflagration, by the intense brilliancy of the substances in\r\ncombustion, is produced in pure oxygen. We must not be in a hurry to\r\nproclaim the existence of a lunar atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nThe fiery mountain must have been situated about the 45° south latitude\r\non the invisible part of the disc; but, to Barbicane’s great\r\ndispleasure, the curve which the projectile was describing was taking\r\nit far from the point indicated by the eruption. Thus he could not\r\ndetermine its nature exactly. Half an hour after being sighted, this\r\nluminous point had disappeared behind the dark horizon; but the\r\nverification of this phenomenon was of considerable consequence in\r\ntheir selenographic studies. It proved that all heat had not yet\r\ndisappeared from the bowels of this globe; and where heat exists, who\r\ncan affirm that the vegetable kingdom, nay, even the animal kingdom\r\nitself, has not up to this time resisted all destructive influences?\r\nThe existence of this volcano in eruption, unmistakably seen by these\r\nearthly savants, would doubtless give rise to many theories favorable\r\nto the grave question of the habitability of the moon.\r\n\r\nBarbicane allowed himself to be carried away by these reflections. He\r\nforgot himself in a deep reverie in which the mysterious destiny of the\r\nlunar world was uppermost. He was seeking to combine together the facts\r\nobserved up to that time, when a new incident recalled him briskly to\r\nreality. This incident was more than a cosmical phenomenon; it was a\r\nthreatened danger, the consequence of which might be disastrous in the\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in the midst of the ether, in the profound darkness, an\r\nenormous mass appeared. It was like a moon, but an incandescent moon\r\nwhose brilliancy was all the more intolerable as it cut sharply on the\r\nfrightful darkness of space. This mass, of a circular form, threw a\r\nlight which filled the projectile. The forms of Barbicane, Nicholl, and\r\nMichel Ardan, bathed in its white sheets, assumed that livid spectral\r\nappearance which physicians produce with the fictitious light of\r\nalcohol impregnated with salt.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” cried Michel Ardan, “we are hideous. What is that\r\nill-conditioned moon?”\r\n\r\n“A meteor,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“A meteor burning in space?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThis shooting globe suddenly appearing in shadow at a distance of at\r\nmost 200 miles, ought, according to Barbicane, to have a diameter of\r\n2,000 yards. It advanced at a speed of about one mile and a half per\r\nsecond. It cut the projectile’s path and must reach it in some minutes.\r\nAs it approached it grew to enormous proportions.\r\n\r\nImagine, if possible, the situation of the travelers! It is impossible\r\nto describe it. In spite of their courage, their _sang-froid_, their\r\ncarelessness of danger, they were mute, motionless with stiffened\r\nlimbs, a prey to frightful terror. Their projectile, the course of\r\nwhich they could not alter, was rushing straight on this ignited mass,\r\nmore intense than the open mouth of an oven. It seemed as though they\r\nwere being precipitated toward an abyss of fire.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had seized the hands of his two companions, and all three\r\nlooked through their half-open eyelids upon that asteroid heated to a\r\nwhite heat. If thought was not destroyed within them, if their brains\r\nstill worked amid all this awe, they must have given themselves up for\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes after the sudden appearance of the meteor (to them two\r\ncenturies of anguish) the projectile seemed almost about to strike it,\r\nwhen the globe of fire burst like a bomb, but without making any noise\r\nin that void where sound, which is but the agitation of the layers of\r\nair, could not be generated.\r\n\r\nNicholl uttered a cry, and he and his companions rushed to the scuttle.\r\nWhat a sight! What pen can describe it? What palette is rich enough in\r\ncolors to reproduce so magnificent a spectacle?\r\n\r\nIt was like the opening of a crater, like the scattering of an immense\r\nconflagration. Thousands of luminous fragments lit up and irradiated\r\nspace with their fires. Every size, every color, was there\r\nintermingled. There were rays of yellow and pale yellow, red, green,\r\ngray—a crown of fireworks of all colors. Of the enormous and\r\nmuch-dreaded globe there remained nothing but these fragments carried\r\nin all directions, now become asteroids in their turn, some flaming\r\nlike a sword, some surrounded by a whitish cloud, and others leaving\r\nbehind them trains of brilliant cosmical dust.\r\n\r\nThese incandescent blocks crossed and struck each other, scattering\r\nstill smaller fragments, some of which struck the projectile. Its left\r\nscuttle was even cracked by a violent shock. It seemed to be floating\r\namid a hail of howitzer shells, the smallest of which might destroy it\r\ninstantly.\r\n\r\nThe light which saturated the ether was so wonderfully intense, that\r\nMichel, drawing Barbicane and Nicholl to his window, exclaimed, “The\r\ninvisible moon, visible at last!”\r\n\r\nAnd through a luminous emanation, which lasted some seconds, the whole\r\nthree caught a glimpse of that mysterious disc which the eye of man now\r\nsaw for the first time. What could they distinguish at a distance which\r\nthey could not estimate? Some lengthened bands along the disc, real\r\nclouds formed in the midst of a very confined atmosphere, from which\r\nemerged not only all the mountains, but also projections of less\r\nimportance; its circles, its yawning craters, as capriciously placed as\r\non the visible surface. Then immense spaces, no longer arid plains, but\r\nreal seas, oceans, widely distributed, reflecting on their liquid\r\nsurface all the dazzling magic of the fires of space; and, lastly, on\r\nthe surface of the continents, large dark masses, looking like immense\r\nforests under the rapid illumination of a brilliance.\r\n\r\nWas it an illusion, a mistake, an optical illusion? Could they give a\r\nscientific assent to an observation so superficially obtained? Dared\r\nthey pronounce upon the question of its habitability after so slight a\r\nglimpse of the invisible disc?\r\n\r\nBut the lightnings in space subsided by degrees; its accidental\r\nbrilliancy died away; the asteroids dispersed in different directions\r\nand were extinguished in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe ether returned to its accustomed darkness; the stars, eclipsed for\r\na moment, again twinkled in the firmament, and the disc, so hastily\r\ndiscerned, was again buried in impenetrable night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nTHE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe projectile had just escaped a terrible danger, and a very unforseen\r\none. Who would have thought of such an encounter with meteors? These\r\nerring bodies might create serious perils for the travelers. They were\r\nto them so many sandbanks upon that sea of ether which, less fortunate\r\nthan sailors, they could not escape. But did these adventurers complain\r\nof space? No, not since nature had given them the splendid sight of a\r\ncosmical meteor bursting from expansion, since this inimitable\r\nfirework, which no Ruggieri could imitate, had lit up for some seconds\r\nthe invisible glory of the moon. In that flash, continents, seas, and\r\nforests had become visible to them. Did an atmosphere, then, bring to\r\nthis unknown face its life-giving atoms? Questions still insoluble, and\r\nforever closed against human curiousity!\r\n\r\nIt was then half-past three in the afternoon. The projectile was\r\nfollowing its curvilinear direction round the moon. Had its course\r\nagain been altered by the meteor? It was to be feared so. But the\r\nprojectile must describe a curve unalterably determined by the laws of\r\nmechanical reasoning. Barbicane was inclined to believe that this curve\r\nwould be rather a parabola than a hyperbola. But admitting the\r\nparabola, the projectile must quickly have passed through the cone of\r\nshadow projected into space opposite the sun. This cone, indeed, is\r\nvery narrow, the angular diameter of the moon being so little when\r\ncompared with the diameter of the orb of day; and up to this time the\r\nprojectile had been floating in this deep shadow. Whatever had been its\r\nspeed (and it could not have been insignificant), its period of\r\noccultation continued. That was evident, but perhaps that would not\r\nhave been the case in a supposedly rigidly parabolical trajectory—a new\r\nproblem which tormented Barbicane’s brain, imprisoned as he was in a\r\ncircle of unknowns which he could not unravel.\r\n\r\nNeither of the travelers thought of taking an instant’s repose. Each\r\none watched for an unexpected fact, which might throw some new light on\r\ntheir uranographic studies. About five o’clock, Michel Ardan\r\ndistributed, under the name of dinner, some pieces of bread and cold\r\nmeat, which were quickly swallowed without either of them abandoning\r\ntheir scuttle, the glass of which was incessantly encrusted by the\r\ncondensation of vapor.\r\n\r\nAbout forty-five minutes past five in the evening, Nicholl, armed with\r\nhis glass, sighted toward the southern border of the moon, and in the\r\ndirection followed by the projectile, some bright points cut upon the\r\ndark shield of the sky. They looked like a succession of sharp points\r\nlengthened into a tremulous line. They were very bright. Such appeared\r\nthe terminal line of the moon when in one of her octants.\r\n\r\nThey could not be mistaken. It was no longer a simple meteor. This\r\nluminous ridge had neither color nor motion. Nor was it a volcano in\r\neruption. And Barbicane did not hesitate to pronounce upon it.\r\n\r\n“The sun!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“What! the sun?” answered Nicholl and Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friends, it is the radiant orb itself lighting up the summit\r\nof the mountains situated on the southern borders of the moon. We are\r\nevidently nearing the south pole.”\r\n\r\n“After having passed the north pole,” replied Michel. “We have made the\r\ncircuit of our satellite, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my good Michel.”\r\n\r\n“Then, no more hyperbolas, no more parabolas, no more open curves to\r\nfear?”\r\n\r\n“No, but a closed curve.”\r\n\r\n“Which is called—”\r\n\r\n“An ellipse. Instead of losing itself in interplanetary space, it is\r\nprobable that the projectile will describe an elliptical orbit around\r\nthe moon.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“And that it will become _her_ satellite.”\r\n\r\n“Moon of the moon!” cried Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“Only, I would have you observe, my worthy friend,” replied Barbicane,\r\n“that we are none the less lost for that.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in another manner, and much more pleasantly,” answered the\r\ncareless Frenchman with his most amiable smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nTYCHO\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six in the evening the projectile passed the south pole at less than\r\nforty miles off, a distance equal to that already reached at the north\r\npole. The elliptical curve was being rigidly carried out.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the travelers once more entered the blessed rays of the\r\nsun. They saw once more those stars which move slowly from east to\r\nwest. The radiant orb was saluted by a triple hurrah. With its light it\r\nalso sent heat, which soon pierced the metal walls. The glass resumed\r\nits accustomed appearance. The layers of ice melted as if by\r\nenchantment; and immediately, for economy’s sake, the gas was put out,\r\nthe air apparatus alone consuming its usual quantity.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Nicholl, “these rays of heat are good. With what impatience\r\nmust the Selenites wait the reappearance of the orb of day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Michel Ardan, “imbibing as it were the brilliant ether,\r\nlight and heat, all life is contained in them.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the bottom of the projectile deviated somewhat from the\r\nlunar surface, in order to follow the slightly lengthened elliptical\r\norbit. From this point, had the earth been at the full, Barbicane and\r\nhis companions could have seen it, but immersed in the sun’s\r\nirradiation she was quite invisible. Another spectacle attracted their\r\nattention, that of the southern part of the moon, brought by the\r\nglasses to within 450 yards. They did not again leave the scuttles, and\r\nnoted every detail of this fantastical continent.\r\n\r\nMounts Doerful and Leibnitz formed two separate groups very near the\r\nsouth pole. The first group extended from the pole to the eighty-fourth\r\nparallel, on the eastern part of the orb; the second occupied the\r\neastern border, extending from the 65° of latitude to the pole.\r\n\r\nOn their capriciously formed ridge appeared dazzling sheets, as\r\nmentioned by Pere Secchi. With more certainty than the illustrious\r\nRoman astronomer, Barbicane was enabled to recognize their nature.\r\n\r\n“They are snow,” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Snow?” repeated Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Nicholl, snow; the surface of which is deeply frozen. See how\r\nthey reflect the luminous rays. Cooled lava would never give out such\r\nintense reflection. There must then be water, there must be air on the\r\nmoon. As little as you please, but the fact can no longer be\r\ncontested.” No, it could not be. And if ever Barbicane should see the\r\nearth again, his notes will bear witness to this great fact in his\r\nselenographic observations.\r\n\r\nThese mountains of Doerful and Leibnitz rose in the midst of plains of\r\na medium extent, which were bounded by an indefinite succession of\r\ncircles and annular ramparts. These two chains are the only ones met\r\nwith in this region of circles. Comparatively but slightly marked, they\r\nthrow up here and there some sharp points, the highest summit of which\r\nattains an altitude of 24,600 feet.\r\n\r\nBut the projectile was high above all this landscape, and the\r\nprojections disappeared in the intense brilliancy of the disc. And to\r\nthe eyes of the travelers there reappeared that original aspect of the\r\nlunar landscapes, raw in tone, without gradation of colors, and without\r\ndegrees of shadow, roughly black and white, from the want of diffusion\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nBut the sight of this desolate world did not fail to captivate them by\r\nits very strangeness. They were moving over this region as if they had\r\nbeen borne on the breath of some storm, watching heights defile under\r\ntheir feet, piercing the cavities with their eyes, going down into the\r\nrifts, climbing the ramparts, sounding these mysterious holes, and\r\nleveling all cracks. But no trace of vegetation, no appearance of\r\ncities; nothing but stratification, beds of lava, overflowings polished\r\nlike immense mirrors, reflecting the sun’s rays with overpowering\r\nbrilliancy. Nothing belonging to a _living_ world—everything to a dead\r\nworld, where avalanches, rolling from the summits of the mountains,\r\nwould disperse noiselessly at the bottom of the abyss, retaining the\r\nmotion, but wanting the sound. In any case it was the image of death,\r\nwithout its being possible even to say that life had ever existed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan, however, thought he recognized a heap of ruins, to which\r\nhe drew Barbicane’s attention. It was about the 80th parallel, in 30°\r\nlongitude. This heap of stones, rather regularly placed, represented a\r\nvast fortress, overlooking a long rift, which in former days had served\r\nas a bed to the rivers of prehistorical times. Not far from that, rose\r\nto a height of 17,400 feet the annular mountain of Short, equal to the\r\nAsiatic Caucasus. Michel Ardan, with his accustomed ardor, maintained\r\n“the evidences” of his fortress. Beneath it he discerned the dismantled\r\nramparts of a town; here the still intact arch of a portico, there two\r\nor three columns lying under their base; farther on, a succession of\r\narches which must have supported the conduit of an aqueduct; in another\r\npart the sunken pillars of a gigantic bridge, run into the thickest\r\nparts of the rift. He distinguished all this, but with so much\r\nimagination in his glance, and through glasses so fantastical, that we\r\nmust mistrust his observation. But who could affirm, who would dare to\r\nsay, that the amiable fellow did not really see that which his two\r\ncompanions would not see?\r\n\r\nMoments were too precious to be sacrificed in idle discussion. The\r\nselenite city, whether imaginary or not, had already disappeared afar\r\noff. The distance of the projectile from the lunar disc was on the\r\nincrease, and the details of the soil were being lost in a confused\r\njumble. The reliefs, the circles, the craters, and the plains alone\r\nremained, and still showed their boundary lines distinctly. At this\r\nmoment, to the left, lay extended one of the finest circles of lunar\r\norography, one of the curiosities of this continent. It was Newton,\r\nwhich Barbicane recognized without trouble, by referring to the _Mappa\r\nSelenographica_.\r\n\r\nNewton is situated in exactly 77° south latitude, and 16° east\r\nlongitude. It forms an annular crater, the ramparts of which, rising to\r\na height of 21,300 feet, seemed to be impassable.\r\n\r\nBarbicane made his companions observe that the height of this mountain\r\nabove the surrounding plain was far from equaling the depth of its\r\ncrater. This enormous hole was beyond all measurement, and formed a\r\ngloomy abyss, the bottom of which the sun’s rays could never reach.\r\nThere, according to Humboldt, reigns utter darkness, which the light of\r\nthe sun and the earth cannot break. Mythologists could well have made\r\nit the mouth of hell.\r\n\r\n“Newton,” said Barbicane, “is the most perfect type of these annular\r\nmountains, of which the earth possesses no sample. They prove that the\r\nmoon’s formation, by means of cooling, is due to violent causes; for\r\nwhile, under the pressure of internal fires the reliefs rise to\r\nconsiderable height, the depths withdraw far below the lunar level.”\r\n\r\n“I do not dispute the fact,” replied Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nSome minutes after passing Newton, the projectile directly overlooked\r\nthe annular mountains of Moret. It skirted at some distance the summits\r\nof Blancanus, and at about half-past seven in the evening reached the\r\ncircle of Clavius.\r\n\r\nThis circle, one of the most remarkable of the disc, is situated in 58°\r\nsouth latitude, and 15° east longitude. Its height is estimated at\r\n22,950 feet. The travelers, at a distance of twenty-four miles (reduced\r\nto four by their glasses) could admire this vast crater in its\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\n“Terrestrial volcanoes,” said Barbicane, “are but mole-hills compared\r\nwith those of the moon. Measuring the old craters formed by the first\r\neruptions of Vesuvius and Etna, we find them little more than three\r\nmiles in breadth. In France the circle of Cantal measures six miles\r\nacross; at Ceyland the circle of the island is forty miles, which is\r\nconsidered the largest on the globe. What are these diameters against\r\nthat of Clavius, which we overlook at this moment?”\r\n\r\n“What is its breadth?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“It is 150 miles,” replied Barbicane. “This circle is certainly the\r\nmost important on the moon, but many others measure 150, 100, or 75\r\nmiles.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my friends,” exclaimed Michel, “can you picture to yourselves what\r\nthis now peaceful orb of night must have been when its craters, filled\r\nwith thunderings, vomited at the same time smoke and tongues of flame.\r\nWhat a wonderful spectacle then, and now what decay! This moon is\r\nnothing more than a thin carcase of fireworks, whose squibs, rockets,\r\nserpents, and suns, after a superb brilliancy, have left but sadly\r\nbroken cases. Who can say the cause, the reason, the motive force of\r\nthese cataclysms?”\r\n\r\nBarbicane was not listening to Michel Ardan; he was contemplating these\r\nramparts of Clavius, formed by large mountains spread over several\r\nmiles. At the bottom of the immense cavity burrowed hundreds of small\r\nextinguished craters, riddling the soil like a colander, and overlooked\r\nby a peak 15,000 feet high.\r\n\r\nAround the plain appeared desolate. Nothing so arid as these reliefs,\r\nnothing so sad as these ruins of mountains, and (if we may so express\r\nourselves) these fragments of peaks and mountains which strewed the\r\nsoil. The satellite seemed to have burst at this spot.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was still advancing, and this movement did not subside.\r\nCircles, craters, and uprooted mountains succeeded each other\r\nincessantly. No more plains; no more seas. A never ending Switzerland\r\nand Norway. And lastly, in the canter of this region of crevasses, the\r\nmost splendid mountain on the lunar disc, the dazzling Tycho, in which\r\nposterity will ever preserve the name of the illustrious Danish\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\nIn observing the full moon in a cloudless sky no one has failed to\r\nremark this brilliant point of the southern hemisphere. Michel Ardan\r\nused every metaphor that his imagination could supply to designate it\r\nby. To him this Tycho was a focus of light, a center of irradiation, a\r\ncrater vomiting rays. It was the tire of a brilliant wheel, an\r\n_asteria_ enclosing the disc with its silver tentacles, an enormous eye\r\nfilled with flames, a glory carved for Pluto’s head, a star launched by\r\nthe Creator’s hand, and crushed against the face of the moon!\r\n\r\nTycho forms such a concentration of light that the inhabitants of the\r\nearth can see it without glasses, though at a distance of 240,000\r\nmiles! Imagine, then, its intensity to the eye of observers placed at a\r\ndistance of only fifty miles! Seen through this pure ether, its\r\nbrilliancy was so intolerable that Barbicane and his friends were\r\nobliged to blacken their glasses with the gas smoke before they could\r\nbear the splendor. Then silent, scarcely uttering an interjection of\r\nadmiration, they gazed, they contemplated. All their feelings, all\r\ntheir impressions, were concentrated in that look, as under any violent\r\nemotion all life is concentrated at the heart.\r\n\r\nTycho belongs to the system of radiating mountains, like Aristarchus\r\nand Copernicus; but it is of all the most complete and decided, showing\r\nunquestionably the frightful volcanic action to which the formation of\r\nthe moon is due. Tycho is situated in 43° south latitude, and 12° east\r\nlongitude. Its center is occupied by a crater fifty miles broad. It\r\nassumes a slightly elliptical form, and is surrounded by an enclosure\r\nof annular ramparts, which on the east and west overlook the outer\r\nplain from a height of 15,000 feet. It is a group of Mont Blancs,\r\nplaced round one common center and crowned by radiating beams.\r\n\r\nWhat this incomparable mountain really is, with all the projections\r\nconverging toward it, and the interior excrescences of its crater,\r\nphotography itself could never represent. Indeed, it is during the full\r\nmoon that Tycho is seen in all its splendor. Then all shadows\r\ndisappear, the foreshortening of perspective disappears, and all proofs\r\nbecome white—a disagreeable fact: for this strange region would have\r\nbeen marvelous if reproduced with photographic exactness. It is but a\r\ngroup of hollows, craters, circles, a network of crests; then, as far\r\nas the eye could see, a whole volcanic network cast upon this encrusted\r\nsoil. One can then understand that the bubbles of this central eruption\r\nhave kept their first form. Crystallized by cooling, they have\r\nstereotyped that aspect which the moon formerly presented when under\r\nthe Plutonian forces.\r\n\r\nThe distance which separated the travelers from the annular summits of\r\nTycho was not so great but that they could catch the principal details.\r\nEven on the causeway forming the fortifications of Tycho, the mountains\r\nhanging on to the interior and exterior sloping flanks rose in stories\r\nlike gigantic terraces. They appeared to be higher by 300 or 400 feet\r\nto the west than to the east. No system of terrestrial encampment could\r\nequal these natural fortifications. A town built at the bottom of this\r\ncircular cavity would have been utterly inaccessible.\r\n\r\nInaccessible and wonderfully extended over this soil covered with\r\npicturesque projections! Indeed, nature had not left the bottom of this\r\ncrater flat and empty. It possessed its own peculiar orography, a\r\nmountainous system, making it a world in itself. The travelers could\r\ndistinguish clearly cones, central hills, remarkable positions of the\r\nsoil, naturally placed to receive the _chefs-d’œuvre_ of Selenite\r\narchitecture. There was marked out the place for a temple, here the\r\nground of a forum, on this spot the plan of a palace, in another the\r\nplateau for a citadel; the whole overlooked by a central mountain of\r\n1,500 feet. A vast circle, in which ancient Rome could have been held\r\nin its entirety ten times over.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, enthusiastic at the sight; “what a grand\r\ntown might be constructed within that ring of mountains! A quiet city,\r\na peaceful refuge, beyond all human misery. How calm and isolated those\r\nmisanthropes, those haters of humanity might live there, and all who\r\nhave a distaste for social life!”\r\n\r\n“All! It would be too small for them,” replied Barbicane simply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nGRAVE QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the projectile had passed the _enceinte_ of Tycho, and Barbicane\r\nand his two companions watched with scrupulous attention the brilliant\r\nrays which the celebrated mountain shed so curiously over the horizon.\r\n\r\nWhat was this radiant glory? What geological phenomenon had designed\r\nthese ardent beams? This question occupied Barbicane’s mind.\r\n\r\nUnder his eyes ran in all directions luminous furrows, raised at the\r\nedges and concave in the center, some twelve miles, others thirty miles\r\nbroad. These brilliant trains extended in some places to within 600\r\nmiles of Tycho, and seemed to cover, particularly toward the east, the\r\nnortheast and the north, the half of the southern hemisphere. One of\r\nthese jets extended as far as the circle of Neander, situated on the\r\n40th meridian. Another, by a slight curve, furrowed the “Sea of\r\nNectar,” breaking against the chain of Pyrenees, after a circuit of 800\r\nmiles. Others, toward the west, covered the “Sea of Clouds” and the\r\n“Sea of Humors” with a luminous network. What was the origin of these\r\nsparkling rays, which shone on the plains as well as on the reliefs, at\r\nwhatever height they might be? All started from a common center, the\r\ncrater of Tycho. They sprang from him. Herschel attributed their\r\nbrilliancy to currents of lava congealed by the cold; an opinion,\r\nhowever, which has not been generally adopted. Other astronomers have\r\nseen in these inexplicable rays a kind of moraines, rows of erratic\r\nblocks, which had been thrown up at the period of Tycho’s formation.\r\n\r\n“And why not?” asked Nicholl of Barbicane, who was relating and\r\nrejecting these different opinions.\r\n\r\n“Because the regularity of these luminous lines, and the violence\r\nnecessary to carry volcanic matter to such distances, is inexplicable.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! by Jove!” replied Michel Ardan, “it seems easy enough to me to\r\nexplain the origin of these rays.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” continued Michel. “It is enough to say that it is a vast\r\nstar, similar to that produced by a ball or a stone thrown at a square\r\nof glass!”\r\n\r\n“Well!” replied Barbicane, smiling. “And what hand would be powerful\r\nenough to throw a ball to give such a shock as that?”\r\n\r\n“The hand is not necessary,” answered Nicholl, not at all confounded;\r\n“and as to the stone, let us suppose it to be a comet.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! those much-abused comets!” exclaimed Barbicane. “My brave Michel,\r\nyour explanation is not bad; but your comet is useless. The shock which\r\nproduced that rent must have some from the inside of the star. A\r\nviolent contraction of the lunar crust, while cooling, might suffice to\r\nimprint this gigantic star.”\r\n\r\n“A contraction! something like a lunar stomach-ache.” said Michel\r\nArdan.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” added Barbicane, “this opinion is that of an English savant,\r\nNasmyth, and it seems to me to sufficiently explain the radiation of\r\nthese mountains.”\r\n\r\n“That Nasmyth was no fool!” replied Michel.\r\n\r\nLong did the travelers, whom such a sight could never weary, admire the\r\nsplendors of Tycho. Their projectile, saturated with luminous gleams in\r\nthe double irradiation of sun and moon, must have appeared like an\r\nincandescent globe. They had passed suddenly from excessive cold to\r\nintense heat. Nature was thus preparing them to become Selenites.\r\nBecome Selenites! That idea brought up once more the question of the\r\nhabitability of the moon. After what they had seen, could the travelers\r\nsolve it? Would they decide for or against it? Michel Ardan persuaded\r\nhis two friends to form an opinion, and asked them directly if they\r\nthought that men and animals were represented in the lunar world.\r\n\r\n“I think that we can answer,” said Barbicane; “but according to my idea\r\nthe question ought not to be put in that form. I ask it to be put\r\ndifferently.”\r\n\r\n“Put it your own way,” replied Michel.\r\n\r\n“Here it is,” continued Barbicane. “The problem is a double one, and\r\nrequires a double solution. Is the moon _habitable_? Has the moon ever\r\nbeen _inhabitable_?”\r\n\r\n“Good!” replied Nicholl. “First let us see whether the moon is\r\nhabitable.”\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, I know nothing about it,” answered Michel.\r\n\r\n“And I answer in the negative,” continued Barbicane. “In her actual\r\nstate, with her surrounding atmosphere certainly very much reduced, her\r\nseas for the most part dried up, her insufficient supply of water\r\nrestricted, vegetation, sudden alternations of cold and heat, her days\r\nand nights of 354 hours—the moon does not seem habitable to me, nor\r\ndoes she seem propitious to animal development, nor sufficient for the\r\nwants of existence as we understand it.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed,” replied Nicholl. “But is not the moon habitable for creatures\r\ndifferently organized from ourselves?”\r\n\r\n“That question is more difficult to answer, but I will try; and I ask\r\nNicholl if _motion_ appears to him to be a necessary result of _life_,\r\nwhatever be its organization?”\r\n\r\n“Without a doubt!” answered Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Then, my worthy companion, I would answer that we have observed the\r\nlunar continent at a distance of 500 yards at most, and that nothing\r\nseemed to us to move on the moon’s surface. The presence of any kind of\r\nlife would have been betrayed by its attendant marks, such as divers\r\nbuildings, and even by ruins. And what have we seen? Everywhere and\r\nalways the geological works of nature, never the work of man. If, then,\r\nthere exist representatives of the animal kingdom on the moon, they\r\nmust have fled to those unfathomable cavities which the eye cannot\r\nreach; which I cannot admit, for they must have left traces of their\r\npassage on those plains which the atmosphere must cover, however\r\nslightly raised it may be. These traces are nowhere visible. There\r\nremains but one hypothesis, that of a living race to which motion,\r\nwhich is life, is foreign.”\r\n\r\n“One might as well say, living creatures which do not live,” replied\r\nMichel.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” said Barbicane, “which for us has no meaning.”\r\n\r\n“Then we may form our opinion?” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” continued Michel Ardan, “the Scientific Commission\r\nassembled in the projectile of the Gun Club, after having founded their\r\nargument on facts recently observed, decide unanimously upon the\r\nquestion of the habitability of the moon—‘_No!_ the moon is not\r\nhabitable.’”\r\n\r\nThis decision was consigned by President Barbicane to his notebook,\r\nwhere the process of the sitting of the 6th of December may be seen.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Nicholl, “let us attack the second question, an\r\nindispensable complement of the first. I ask the honorable commission,\r\nif the moon is not habitable, has she ever been inhabited, Citizen\r\nBarbicane?”\r\n\r\n“My friends,” replied Barbicane, “I did not undertake this journey in\r\norder to form an opinion on the past habitability of our satellite; but\r\nI will add that our personal observations only confirm me in this\r\nopinion. I believe, indeed I affirm, that the moon has been inhabited\r\nby a human race organized like our own; that she has produced animals\r\nanatomically formed like the terrestrial animals: but I add that these\r\nraces, human and animal, have had their day, and are now forever\r\nextinct!”\r\n\r\n“Then,” asked Michel, “the moon must be older than the earth?”\r\n\r\n“No!” said Barbicane decidedly, “but a world which has grown old\r\nquicker, and whose formation and deformation have been more rapid.\r\nRelatively, the organizing force of matter has been much more violent\r\nin the interior of the moon than in the interior of the terrestrial\r\nglobe. The actual state of this cracked, twisted, and burst disc\r\nabundantly proves this. The moon and the earth were nothing but gaseous\r\nmasses originally. These gases have passed into a liquid state under\r\ndifferent influences, and the solid masses have been formed later. But\r\nmost certainly our sphere was still gaseous or liquid, when the moon\r\nwas solidified by cooling, and had become habitable.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Barbicane, “an atmosphere surrounded it, the waters\r\ncontained within this gaseous envelope could not evaporate. Under the\r\ninfluence of air, water, light, solar heat, and central heat,\r\nvegetation took possession of the continents prepared to receive it,\r\nand certainly life showed itself about this period, for nature does not\r\nexpend herself in vain; and a world so wonderfully formed for\r\nhabitation must necessarily be inhabited.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Nicholl, “many phenomena inherent in our satellite might\r\ncramp the expansion of the animal and vegetable kingdom. For example,\r\nits days and nights of 354 hours?”\r\n\r\n“At the terrestrial poles they last six months,” said Michel.\r\n\r\n“An argument of little value, since the poles are not inhabited.”\r\n\r\n“Let us observe, my friends,” continued Barbicane, “that if in the\r\nactual state of the moon its long nights and long days created\r\ndifferences of temperature insupportable to organization, it was not so\r\nat the historical period of time. The atmosphere enveloped the disc\r\nwith a fluid mantle; vapor deposited itself in the shape of clouds;\r\nthis natural screen tempered the ardor of the solar rays, and retained\r\nthe nocturnal radiation. Light, like heat, can diffuse itself in the\r\nair; hence an equality between the influences which no longer exists,\r\nnow that atmosphere has almost entirely disappeared. And now I am going\r\nto astonish you.”\r\n\r\n“Astonish us?” said Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“I firmly believe that at the period when the moon was inhabited, the\r\nnights and days did not last 354 hours!”\r\n\r\n“And why?” asked Nicholl quickly.\r\n\r\n“Because most probably then the rotary motion of the moon upon her axis\r\nwas not equal to her revolution, an equality which presents each part\r\nof her disc during fifteen days to the action of the solar rays.”\r\n\r\n“Granted,” replied Nicholl, “but why should not these two motions have\r\nbeen equal, as they are really so?”\r\n\r\n“Because that equality has only been determined by terrestrial\r\nattraction. And who can say that this attraction was powerful enough to\r\nalter the motion of the moon at that period when the earth was still\r\nfluid?”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied Nicholl; “and who can say that the moon has always\r\nbeen a satellite of the earth?”\r\n\r\n“And who can say,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “that the moon did not exist\r\nbefore the earth?”\r\n\r\nTheir imaginations carried them away into an indefinite field of\r\nhypothesis. Barbicane sought to restrain them.\r\n\r\n“Those speculations are too high,” said he; “problems utterly\r\ninsoluble. Do not let us enter upon them. Let us only admit the\r\ninsufficiency of the primordial attraction; and then by the inequality\r\nof the two motions of rotation and revolution, the days and nights\r\ncould have succeeded each other on the moon as they succeed each other\r\non the earth. Besides, even without these conditions, life was\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” asked Michel Ardan, “humanity has disappeared from the moon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Barbicane, “after having doubtless remained persistently\r\nfor millions of centuries; by degrees the atmosphere becoming rarefied,\r\nthe disc became uninhabitable, as the terrestrial globe will one day\r\nbecome by cooling.”\r\n\r\n“By cooling?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” replied Barbicane; “as the internal fires became\r\nextinguished, and the incandescent matter concentrated itself, the\r\nlunar crust cooled. By degrees the consequences of these phenomena\r\nshowed themselves in the disappearance of organized beings, and by the\r\ndisappearance of vegetation. Soon the atmosphere was rarefied, probably\r\nwithdrawn by terrestrial attraction; then aerial departure of\r\nrespirable air, and disappearance of water by means of evaporation. At\r\nthis period the moon becoming uninhabitable, was no longer inhabited.\r\nIt was a dead world, such as we see it to-day.”\r\n\r\n“And you say that the same fate is in store for the earth?”\r\n\r\n“Most probably.”\r\n\r\n“But when?”\r\n\r\n“When the cooling of its crust shall have made it uninhabitable.”\r\n\r\n“And have they calculated the time which our unfortunate sphere will\r\ntake to cool?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“And you know these calculations?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly.”\r\n\r\n“But speak, then, my clumsy savant,” exclaimed Michel Ardan, “for you\r\nmake me boil with impatience!”\r\n\r\n“Very well, my good Michel,” replied Barbicane quietly; “we know what\r\ndiminution of temperature the earth undergoes in the lapse of a\r\ncentury. And according to certain calculations, this mean temperature\r\nwill after a period of 400,000 years, be brought down to zero!”\r\n\r\n“Four hundred thousand years!” exclaimed Michel. “Ah! I breathe again.\r\nReally I was frightened to hear you; I imagined that we had not more\r\nthan 50,000 years to live.”\r\n\r\nBarbicane and Nicholl could not help laughing at their companion’s\r\nuneasiness. Then Nicholl, who wished to end the discussion, put the\r\nsecond question, which had just been considered again.\r\n\r\n“Has the moon been inhabited?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe answer was unanimously in the affirmative. But during this\r\ndiscussion, fruitful in somewhat hazardous theories, the projectile was\r\nrapidly leaving the moon: the lineaments faded away from the travelers’\r\neyes, mountains were confused in the distance; and of all the\r\nwonderful, strange, and fantastical form of the earth’s satellite,\r\nthere soon remained nothing but the imperishable remembrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nA STRUGGLE AGAINST THE IMPOSSIBLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time Barbicane and his companions looked silently and sadly\r\nupon that world which they had only seen from a distance, as Moses saw\r\nthe land of Canaan, and which they were leaving without a possibility\r\nof ever returning to it. The projectile’s position with regard to the\r\nmoon had altered, and the base was now turned to the earth.\r\n\r\nThis change, which Barbicane verified, did not fail to surprise them.\r\nIf the projectile was to gravitate round the satellite in an elliptical\r\norbit, why was not its heaviest part turned toward it, as the moon\r\nturns hers to the earth? That was a difficult point.\r\n\r\nIn watching the course of the projectile they could see that on leaving\r\nthe moon it followed a course analogous to that traced in approaching\r\nher. It was describing a very long ellipse, which would most likely\r\nextend to the point of equal attraction, where the influences of the\r\nearth and its satellite are neutralized.\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion which Barbicane very justly drew from facts\r\nalready observed, a conviction which his two friends shared with him.\r\n\r\n“And when arrived at this dead point, what will become of us?” asked\r\nMichel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know,” replied Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“But one can draw some hypotheses, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Two,” answered Barbicane; “either the projectile’s speed will be\r\ninsufficient, and it will remain forever immovable on this line of\r\ndouble attraction—”\r\n\r\n“I prefer the other hypothesis, whatever it may be,” interrupted\r\nMichel.\r\n\r\n“Or,” continued Barbicane, “its speed will be sufficient, and it will\r\ncontinue its elliptical course, to gravitate forever around the orb of\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“A revolution not at all consoling,” said Michel, “to pass to the state\r\nof humble servants to a moon whom we are accustomed to look upon as our\r\nown handmaid. So that is the fate in store for us?”\r\n\r\nNeither Barbicane nor Nicholl answered.\r\n\r\n“You do not answer,” continued Michel impatiently.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to answer,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing to try?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Barbicane. “Do you pretend to fight against the\r\nimpossible?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Do one Frenchman and two Americans shrink from such a word?”\r\n\r\n“But what would you do?”\r\n\r\n“Subdue this motion which is bearing us away.”\r\n\r\n“Subdue it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Michel, getting animated, “or else alter it, and\r\nemploy it to the accomplishment of our own ends.”\r\n\r\n“And how?”\r\n\r\n“That is your affair. If artillerymen are not masters of their\r\nprojectile they are not artillerymen. If the projectile is to command\r\nthe gunner, we had better ram the gunner into the gun. My faith! fine\r\nsavants! who do not know what is to become of us after inducing me—”\r\n\r\n“Inducing you!” cried Barbicane and Nicholl. “Inducing you! What do you\r\nmean by that?”\r\n\r\n“No recrimination,” said Michel. “I do not complain, the trip has\r\npleased me, and the projectile agrees with me; but let us do all that\r\nis humanly possible to do the fall somewhere, even if only on the\r\nmoon.”\r\n\r\n“We ask no better, my worthy Michel,” replied Barbicane, “but means\r\nfail us.”\r\n\r\n“We cannot alter the motion of the projectile?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Nor diminish its speed?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Not even by lightening it, as they lighten an overloaded vessel?”\r\n\r\n“What would you throw out?” said Nicholl. “We have no ballast on board;\r\nand indeed it seems to me that if lightened it would go much quicker.”\r\n\r\n“Slower.”\r\n\r\n“Quicker.”\r\n\r\n“Neither slower nor quicker,” said Barbicane, wishing to make his two\r\nfriends agree; “for we float is space, and must no longer consider\r\nspecific weight.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” cried Michel Ardan in a decided voice; “then their remains\r\nbut one thing to do.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Breakfast,” answered the cool, audacious Frenchman, who always brought\r\nup this solution at the most difficult juncture.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if this operation had no influence on the projectile’s\r\ncourse, it could at least be tried without inconvenience, and even with\r\nsuccess from a stomachic point of view. Certainly Michel had none but\r\ngood ideas.\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted then at two in the morning; the hour mattered little.\r\nMichel served his usual repast, crowned by a glorious bottle drawn from\r\nhis private cellar. If ideas did not crowd on their brains, we must\r\ndespair of the Chambertin of 1853. The repast finished, observation\r\nbegan again. Around the projectile, at an invariable distance, were the\r\nobjects which had been thrown out. Evidently, in its translatory motion\r\nround the moon, it had not passed through any atmosphere, for the\r\nspecific weight of these different objects would have checked their\r\nrelative speed.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the terrestrial sphere nothing was to be seen. The earth\r\nwas but a day old, having been new the night before at twelve; and two\r\ndays must elapse before its crescent, freed from the solar rays, would\r\nserve as a clock to the Selenites, as in its rotary movement each of\r\nits points after twenty-four hours repasses the same lunar meridian.\r\n\r\nOn the moon’s side the sight was different; the orb shone in all her\r\nsplendor amid innumerable constellations, whose purity could not be\r\ntroubled by her rays. On the disc, the plains were already returning to\r\nthe dark tint which is seen from the earth. The other part of the\r\nnimbus remained brilliant, and in the midst of this general brilliancy\r\nTycho shone prominently like a sun.\r\n\r\nBarbicane had no means of estimating the projectile’s speed, but\r\nreasoning showed that it must uniformly decrease, according to the laws\r\nof mechanical reasoning. Having admitted that the projectile was\r\ndescribing an orbit around the moon, this orbit must necessarily be\r\nelliptical; science proves that it must be so. No motive body\r\ncirculating round an attracting body fails in this law. Every orbit\r\ndescribed in space is elliptical. And why should the projectile of the\r\nGun Club escape this natural arrangement? In elliptical orbits, the\r\nattracting body always occupies one of the foci; so that at one moment\r\nthe satellite is nearer, and at another farther from the orb around\r\nwhich it gravitates. When the earth is nearest the sun she is in her\r\nperihelion; and in her aphelion at the farthest point. Speaking of the\r\nmoon, she is nearest to the earth in her perigee, and farthest from it\r\nin her apogee. To use analogous expressions, with which the\r\nastronomers’ language is enriched, if the projectile remains as a\r\nsatellite of the moon, we must say that it is in its “aposelene” at its\r\nfarthest point, and in its “periselene” at its nearest. In the latter\r\ncase, the projectile would attain its maximum of speed; and in the\r\nformer its minimum. It was evidently moving toward its aposelenitical\r\npoint; and Barbicane had reason to think that its speed would decrease\r\nup to this point, and then increase by degrees as it neared the moon.\r\nThis speed would even become _nil_, if this point joined that of equal\r\nattraction. Barbicane studied the consequences of these different\r\nsituations, and thinking what inference he could draw from them, when\r\nhe was roughly disturbed by a cry from Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” he exclaimed, “I must admit we are down-right simpletons!”\r\n\r\n“I do not say we are not,” replied Barbicane; “but why?”\r\n\r\n“Because we have a very simple means of checking this speed which is\r\nbearing us from the moon, and we do not use it!”\r\n\r\n“And what is the means?”\r\n\r\n“To use the recoil contained in our rockets.”\r\n\r\n“Done!” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“We have not used this force yet,” said Barbicane, “it is true, but we\r\nwill do so.”\r\n\r\n“When?” asked Michel.\r\n\r\n“When the time comes. Observe, my friends, that in the position\r\noccupied by the projectile, an oblique position with regard to the\r\nlunar disc, our rockets, in slightly altering its direction, might turn\r\nit from the moon instead of drawing it nearer?”\r\n\r\n“Just so,” replied Michel.\r\n\r\n“Let us wait, then. By some inexplicable influence, the projectile is\r\nturning its base toward the earth. It is probable that at the point of\r\nequal attraction, its conical cap will be directed rigidly toward the\r\nmoon; at that moment we may hope that its speed will be _nil_; then\r\nwill be the moment to act, and with the influence of our rockets we may\r\nperhaps provoke a fall directly on the surface of the lunar disc.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said Michel. “What we did not do, what we could not do on our\r\nfirst passage at the dead point, because the projectile was then\r\nendowed with too great a speed.”\r\n\r\n“Very well reasoned,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“Let us wait patiently,” continued Barbicane. “Putting every chance on\r\nour side, and after having so much despaired, I may say I think we\r\nshall gain our end.”\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was a signal for Michel Ardan’s hips and hurrahs. And\r\nnone of the audacious boobies remembered the question that they\r\nthemselves had solved in the negative. No! the moon is not inhabited;\r\nno! the moon is probably not habitable. And yet they were going to try\r\neverything to reach her.\r\n\r\nOne single question remained to be solved. At what precise moment the\r\nprojectile would reach the point of equal attraction, on which the\r\ntravelers must play their last card. In order to calculate this to\r\nwithin a few seconds, Barbicane had only to refer to his notes, and to\r\nreckon the different heights taken on the lunar parallels. Thus the\r\ntime necessary to travel over the distance between the dead point and\r\nthe south pole would be equal to the distance separating the north pole\r\nfrom the dead point. The hours representing the time traveled over were\r\ncarefully noted, and the calculation was easy. Barbicane found that\r\nthis point would be reached at one in the morning on the night of the\r\n7th-8th of December. So that, if nothing interfered with its course, it\r\nwould reach the given point in twenty-two hours.\r\n\r\nThe rockets had primarily been placed to check the fall of the\r\nprojectile upon the moon, and now they were going to employ them for a\r\ndirectly contrary purpose. In any case they were ready, and they had\r\nonly to wait for the moment to set fire to them.\r\n\r\n“Since there is nothing else to be done,” said Nicholl, “I make a\r\nproposition.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Barbicane.\r\n\r\n“I propose to go to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“What a motion!” exclaimed Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\n“It is forty hours since we closed our eyes,” said Nicholl. “Some hours\r\nof sleep will restore our strength.”\r\n\r\n“Never,” interrupted Michel.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued Nicholl, “every one to his taste; I shall go to\r\nsleep.” And stretching himself on the divan, he soon snored like a\r\nforty-eight pounder.\r\n\r\n“That Nicholl has a good deal of sense,” said Barbicane; “presently I\r\nshall follow his example.” Some moments after his continued bass\r\nsupported the captain’s baritone.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Michel Ardan, finding himself alone, “these practical\r\npeople have sometimes most opportune ideas.”\r\n\r\nAnd with his long legs stretched out, and his great arms folded under\r\nhis head, Michel slept in his turn.\r\n\r\nBut this sleep could be neither peaceful nor lasting, the minds of\r\nthese three men were too much occupied, and some hours after, about\r\nseven in the morning, all three were on foot at the same instant.\r\n\r\nThe projectile was still leaving the moon, and turning its conical part\r\nmore and more toward her.\r\n\r\nAn explicable phenomenon, but one which happily served Barbicane’s\r\nends.\r\n\r\nSeventeen hours more, and the moment for action would have arrived.\r\n\r\nThe day seemed long. However bold the travelers might be, they were\r\ngreatly impressed by the approach of that moment which would decide\r\nall—either precipitate their fall on to the moon, or forever chain them\r\nin an immutable orbit. They counted the hours as they passed too slow\r\nfor their wish; Barbicane and Nicholl were obstinately plunged in their\r\ncalculations, Michel going and coming between the narrow walls, and\r\nwatching that impassive moon with a longing eye.\r\n\r\nAt times recollections of the earth crossed their minds. They saw once\r\nmore their friends of the Gun Club, and the dearest of all, J. T.\r\nMaston. At that moment, the honorable secretary must be filling his\r\npost on the Rocky Mountains. If he could see the projectile through the\r\nglass of his gigantic telescope, what would he think? After seeing it\r\ndisappear behind the moon’s south pole, he would see them reappear by\r\nthe north pole! They must therefore be a satellite of a satellite! Had\r\nJ. T. Maston given this unexpected news to the world? Was this the\r\n_denouement_ of this great enterprise?\r\n\r\nBut the day passed without incident. The terrestrial midnight arrived.\r\nThe 8th of December was beginning. One hour more, and the point of\r\nequal attraction would be reached. What speed would then animate the\r\nprojectile? They could not estimate it. But no error could vitiate\r\nBarbicane’s calculations. At one in the morning this speed ought to be\r\nand would be _nil_.\r\n\r\nBesides, another phenomenon would mark the projectile’s stopping-point\r\non the neutral line. At that spot the two attractions, lunar and\r\nterrestrial, would be annulled. Objects would “weigh” no more. This\r\nsingular fact, which had surprised Barbicane and his companions so much\r\nin going, would be repeated on their return under the very same\r\nconditions. At this precise moment they must act.\r\n\r\nAlready the projectile’s conical top was sensibly turned toward the\r\nlunar disc, presented in such a way as to utilize the whole of the\r\nrecoil produced by the pressure of the rocket apparatus. The chances\r\nwere in favor of the travelers. If its speed was utterly annulled on\r\nthis dead point, a decided movement toward the moon would suffice,\r\nhowever slight, to determine its fall.\r\n\r\n“Five minutes to one,” said Nicholl.\r\n\r\n“All is ready,” replied Michel Ardan, directing a lighted match to the\r\nflame of the gas.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” said Barbicane, holding his chronometer in his hand.\r\n\r\nAt that moment weight had no effect. The travelers felt in themselves\r\nthe entire disappearance of it. They were very near the neutral point,\r\nif they did not touch it.\r\n\r\n“One o’clock,” said Barbicane.\r\n\r\nMichel Ardan applied the lighted match to a train in communication with\r\nthe rockets. No detonation was heard in the inside, for there was no\r\nair. But, through the scuttles, Barbicane saw a prolonged smoke, the\r\nflames of which were immediately extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe projectile sustained a certain shock, which was sensibly felt in\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\nThe three friends looked and listened without speaking, and scarcely\r\nbreathing. One might have heard the beating of their hearts amid this\r\nperfect silence.\r\n\r\n“Are we falling?” asked Michel Ardan, at length.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Nicholl, “since the bottom of the projectile is not turning\r\nto the lunar disc!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, Barbicane, quitting his scuttle, turned to his two\r\ncompanions. He was frightfully pale, his forehead wrinkled, and his\r\nlips contracted.\r\n\r\n“We are falling!” said he.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Michel Ardan, “on to the moon?”\r\n\r\n“On to the earth!”\r\n\r\n“The devil!” exclaimed Michel Ardan, adding philosophically, “well,\r\nwhen we came into this projectile we were very doubtful as to the ease\r\nwith which we should get out of it!”\r\n\r\nAnd now this fearful fall had begun. The speed retained had borne the\r\nprojectile beyond the dead point. The explosion of the rockets could\r\nnot divert its course. This speed in going had carried it over the\r\nneutral line, and in returning had done the same thing. The laws of\r\nphysics condemned it _to pass through every point which it had already\r\ngone through_. It was a terrible fall, from a height of 160,000 miles,\r\nand no springs to break it. According to the laws of gunnery, the\r\nprojectile must strike the earth with a speed equal to that with which\r\nit left the mouth of the Columbiad, a speed of 16,000 yards in the last\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nBut to give some figures of comparison, it has been reckoned that an\r\nobject thrown from the top of the towers of Notre Dame, the height of\r\nwhich is only 200 feet, will arrive on the pavement at a speed of 240\r\nmiles per hour. Here the projectile must strike the earth with a speed\r\nof 115,200 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n“We are lost!” said Michel coolly.\r\n\r\n“Very well! if we die,” answered Barbicane, with a sort of religious\r\nenthusiasm, “the results of our travels will be magnificently spread.\r\nIt is His own secret that God will tell us! In the other life the soul\r\nwill want to know nothing, either of machines or engines! It will be\r\nidentified with eternal wisdom!”\r\n\r\n“In fact,” interrupted Michel Ardan, “the whole of the other world may\r\nwell console us for the loss of that inferior orb called the moon!”\r\n\r\nBarbicane crossed his arms on his breast, with a motion of sublime\r\nresignation, saying at the same time:\r\n\r\n“The will of heaven be done!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nTHE SOUNDINGS OF THE SUSQUEHANNA\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, lieutenant, and our soundings?”\r\n\r\n“I think, sir, that the operation is nearing its completion,” replied\r\nLieutenant Bronsfield. “But who would have thought of finding such a\r\ndepth so near in shore, and only 200 miles from the American coast?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Bronsfield, there is a great depression,” said Captain\r\nBlomsberry. “In this spot there is a submarine valley worn by\r\nHumboldt’s current, which skirts the coast of America as far as the\r\nStraits of Magellan.”\r\n\r\n“These great depths,” continued the lieutenant, “are not favorable for\r\nlaying telegraphic cables. A level bottom, like that supporting the\r\nAmerican cable between Valentia and Newfoundland, is much better.”\r\n\r\n“I agree with you, Bronsfield. With your permission, lieutenant, where\r\nare we now?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, at this moment we have 3,508 fathoms of line out, and the ball\r\nwhich draws the sounding lead has not yet touched the bottom; for if\r\nso, it would have come up of itself.”\r\n\r\n“Brook’s apparatus is very ingenious,” said Captain Blomsberry; “it\r\ngives us very exact soundings.”\r\n\r\n“Touch!” cried at this moment one of the men at the forewheel, who was\r\nsuperintending the operation.\r\n\r\nThe captain and the lieutenant mounted the quarterdeck.\r\n\r\n“What depth have we?” asked the captain.\r\n\r\n“Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven fathoms,” replied the\r\nlieutenant, entering it in his notebook.\r\n\r\n“Well, Bronsfield,” said the captain, “I will take down the result. Now\r\nhaul in the sounding line. It will be the work of some hours. In that\r\ntime the engineer can light the furnaces, and we shall be ready to\r\nstart as soon as you have finished. It is ten o’clock, and with your\r\npermission, lieutenant, I will turn in.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, sir; do so!” replied the lieutenant obligingly.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the Susquehanna, as brave a man as need be, and the\r\nhumble servant of his officers, returned to his cabin, took a\r\nbrandy-grog, which earned for the steward no end of praise, and turned\r\nin, not without having complimented his servant upon his making beds,\r\nand slept a peaceful sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was then ten at night. The eleventh day of the month of December was\r\ndrawing to a close in a magnificent night.\r\n\r\nThe Susquehanna, a corvette of 500 horse-power, of the United States\r\nnavy, was occupied in taking soundings in the Pacific Ocean about 200\r\nmiles off the American coast, following that long peninsula which\r\nstretches down the coast of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe wind had dropped by degrees. There was no disturbance in the air.\r\nThe pennant hung motionless from the maintop-gallant- mast truck.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jonathan Blomsberry (cousin-german of Colonel Blomsberry, one\r\nof the most ardent supporters of the Gun Club, who had married an aunt\r\nof the captain and daughter of an honorable Kentucky merchant)—Captain\r\nBlomsberry could not have wished for finer weather in which to bring to\r\na close his delicate operations of sounding. His corvette had not even\r\nfelt the great tempest, which by sweeping away the groups of clouds on\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, had allowed them to observe the course of the\r\nfamous projectile.\r\n\r\nEverything went well, and with all the fervor of a Presbyterian, he did\r\nnot forget to thank heaven for it. The series of soundings taken by the\r\nSusquehanna, had for its aim the finding of a favorable spot for the\r\nlaying of a submarine cable to connect the Hawaiian Islands with the\r\ncoast of America.\r\n\r\nIt was a great undertaking, due to the instigation of a powerful\r\ncompany. Its managing director, the intelligent Cyrus Field, purposed\r\neven covering all the islands of Oceanica with a vast electrical\r\nnetwork, an immense enterprise, and one worthy of American genius.\r\n\r\nTo the corvette Susquehanna had been confided the first operations of\r\nsounding. It was on the night of the 11th-12th of December, she was in\r\nexactly 27° 7′ north latitude, and 41° 37′ west longitude, on the\r\nmeridian of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe moon, then in her last quarter, was beginning to rise above the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Captain Blomsberry, the lieutenant and some\r\nofficers were standing together on the poop. On the appearance of the\r\nmoon, their thoughts turned to that orb which the eyes of a whole\r\nhemisphere were contemplating. The best naval glasses could not have\r\ndiscovered the projectile wandering around its hemisphere, and yet all\r\nwere pointed toward that brilliant disc which millions of eyes were\r\nlooking at at the same moment.\r\n\r\n“They have been gone ten days,” said Lieutenant Bronsfield at last.\r\n“What has become of them?”\r\n\r\n“They have arrived, lieutenant,” exclaimed a young midshipman, “and\r\nthey are doing what all travelers do when they arrive in a new country,\r\ntaking a walk!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I am sure of that, if you tell me so, my young friend,” said\r\nLieutenant Bronsfield, smiling.\r\n\r\n“But,” continued another officer, “their arrival cannot be doubted. The\r\nprojectile was to reach the moon when full on the 5th at midnight. We\r\nare now at the 11th of December, which makes six days. And in six times\r\ntwenty-four hours, without darkness, one would have time to settle\r\ncomfortably. I fancy I see my brave countrymen encamped at the bottom\r\nof some valley, on the borders of a Selenite stream, near a projectile\r\nhalf-buried by its fall amid volcanic rubbish, Captain Nicholl\r\nbeginning his leveling operations, President Barbicane writing out his\r\nnotes, and Michel Ardan embalming the lunar solitudes with the perfume\r\nof his—”\r\n\r\n“Yes! it must be so, it is so!” exclaimed the young midshipman, worked\r\nup to a pitch of enthusiasm by this ideal description of his superior\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n“I should like to believe it,” replied the lieutenant, who was quite\r\nunmoved. “Unfortunately direct news from the lunar world is still\r\nwanting.”\r\n\r\n“Beg pardon, lieutenant,” said the midshipman, “but cannot President\r\nBarbicane write?”\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter greeted this answer.\r\n\r\n“No letters!” continued the young man quickly. “The postal\r\nadministration has something to see to there.”\r\n\r\n“Might it not be the telegraphic service that is at fault?” asked one\r\nof the officers ironically.\r\n\r\n“Not necessarily,” replied the midshipman, not at all confused. “But it\r\nis very easy to set up a graphic communication with the earth.”\r\n\r\n“And how?”\r\n\r\n“By means of the telescope at Long’s Peak. You know it brings the moon\r\nto within four miles of the Rocky Mountains, and that it shows objects\r\non its surface of only nine feet in diameter. Very well; let our\r\nindustrious friends construct a giant alphabet; let them write words\r\nthree fathoms long, and sentences three miles long, and then they can\r\nsend us news of themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe young midshipman, who had a certain amount of imagination, was\r\nloudly applauded; Lieutenant Bronsfield allowing that the idea was\r\npossible, but observing that if by these means they could receive news\r\nfrom the lunar world they could not send any from the terrestrial,\r\nunless the Selenites had instruments fit for taking distant\r\nobservations at their disposal.\r\n\r\n“Evidently,” said one of the officers; “but what has become of the\r\ntravelers? what they have done, what they have seen, that above all\r\nmust interest us. Besides, if the experiment has succeeded (which I do\r\nnot doubt), they will try it again. The Columbiad is still sunk in the\r\nsoil of Florida. It is now only a question of powder and shot; and\r\nevery time the moon is at her zenith a cargo of visitors may be sent to\r\nher.”\r\n\r\n“It is clear,” replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, “that J. T. Maston will\r\none day join his friends.”\r\n\r\n“If he will have me,” cried the midshipman, “I am ready!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! volunteers will not be wanting,” answered Bronsfield; “and if it\r\nwere allowed, half of the earth’s inhabitants would emigrate to the\r\nmoon!”\r\n\r\nThis conversation between the officers of the Susquehanna was kept up\r\nuntil nearly one in the morning. We cannot say what blundering systems\r\nwere broached, what inconsistent theories advanced by these bold\r\nspirits. Since Barbicane’s attempt, nothing seemed impossible to the\r\nAmericans. They had already designed an expedition, not only of\r\nsavants, but of a whole colony toward the Selenite borders, and a\r\ncomplete army, consisting of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, to\r\nconquer the lunar world.\r\n\r\nAt one in the morning, the hauling in of the sounding-line was not yet\r\ncompleted; 1,670 fathoms were still out, which would entail some hours’\r\nwork. According to the commander’s orders, the fires had been lighted,\r\nand steam was being got up. The Susquehanna could have started that\r\nvery instant.\r\n\r\nAt that moment (it was seventeen minutes past one in the morning)\r\nLieutenant Bronsfield was preparing to leave the watch and return to\r\nhis cabin, when his attention was attracted by a distant hissing noise.\r\nHis comrades and himself first thought that this hissing was caused by\r\nthe letting off of steam; but lifting their heads, they found that the\r\nnoise was produced in the highest regions of the air. They had not time\r\nto question each other before the hissing became frightfully intense,\r\nand suddenly there appeared to their dazzled eyes an enormous meteor,\r\nignited by the rapidity of its course and its friction through the\r\natmospheric strata.\r\n\r\nThis fiery mass grew larger to their eyes, and fell, with the noise of\r\nthunder, upon the bowsprit, which it smashed close to the stem, and\r\nburied itself in the waves with a deafening roar!\r\n\r\nA few feet nearer, and the Susquehanna would have foundered with all on\r\nboard!\r\n\r\nAt this instant Captain Blomsberry appeared, half-dressed, and rushing\r\non to the forecastle-deck, whither all the officers had hurried,\r\nexclaimed, “With your permission, gentlemen, what has happened?”\r\n\r\nAnd the midshipman, making himself as it were the echo of the body,\r\ncried, “Commander, it is ‘they’ come back again!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nJ. T. MASTON RECALLED\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is ‘they’ come back again!” the young midshipman had said, and\r\nevery one had understood him. No one doubted but that the meteor was\r\nthe projectile of the Gun Club. As to the travelers which it enclosed,\r\nopinions were divided regarding their fate.\r\n\r\n“They are dead!” said one.\r\n\r\n“They are alive!” said another; “the crater is deep, and the shock was\r\ndeadened.”\r\n\r\n“But they must have wanted air,” continued a third speaker; “they must\r\nhave died of suffocation.”\r\n\r\n“Burned!” replied a fourth; “the projectile was nothing but an\r\nincandescent mass as it crossed the atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“What does it matter!” they exclaimed unanimously; “living or dead, we\r\nmust pull them out!”\r\n\r\nBut Captain Blomsberry had assembled his officers, and “with their\r\npermission,” was holding a council. They must decide upon something to\r\nbe done immediately. The more hasty ones were for fishing up the\r\nprojectile. A difficult operation, though not an impossible one. But\r\nthe corvette had no proper machinery, which must be both fixed and\r\npowerful; so it was resolved that they should put in at the nearest\r\nport, and give information to the Gun Club of the projectile’s fall.\r\n\r\nThis determination was unanimous. The choice of the port had to be\r\ndiscussed. The neighboring coast had no anchorage on 27° latitude.\r\nHigher up, above the peninsula of Monterey, stands the important town\r\nfrom which it takes its name; but, seated on the borders of a perfect\r\ndesert, it was not connected with the interior by a network of\r\ntelegraphic wires, and electricity alone could spread these important\r\nnews fast enough.\r\n\r\nSome degrees above opened the bay of San Francisco. Through the capital\r\nof the gold country communication would be easy with the heart of the\r\nUnion. And in less than two days the Susquehanna, by putting on high\r\npressure, could arrive in that port. She must therefore start at once.\r\n\r\nThe fires were made up; they could set off immediately. Two thousand\r\nfathoms of line were still out, which Captain Blomsberry, not wishing\r\nto lose precious time in hauling in, resolved to cut.\r\n\r\n“we will fasten the end to a buoy,” said he, “and that buoy will show\r\nus the exact spot where the projectile fell.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” replied Lieutenant Bronsfield, “we have our situation\r\nexact—27° 7′ north latitude and 41° 37′ west longitude.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Mr. Bronsfield,” replied the captain, “now, with your\r\npermission, we will have the line cut.”\r\n\r\nA strong buoy, strengthened by a couple of spars, was thrown into the\r\nocean. The end of the rope was carefully lashed to it; and, left solely\r\nto the rise and fall of the billows, the buoy would not sensibly\r\ndeviate from the spot.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the engineer sent to inform the captain that steam was\r\nup and they could start, for which agreeable communication the captain\r\nthanked him. The course was then given north-northeast, and the\r\ncorvette, wearing, steered at full steam direct for San Francisco. It\r\nwas three in the morning.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty miles to cross; it was nothing for a good vessel\r\nlike the Susquehanna. In thirty-six hours she had covered that\r\ndistance; and on the 14th of December, at twenty-seven minutes past one\r\nat night, she entered the bay of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of a ship of the national navy arriving at full speed,\r\nwith her bowsprit broken, public curiosity was greatly roused. A dense\r\ncrowd soon assembled on the quay, waiting for them to disembark.\r\n\r\nAfter casting anchor, Captain Blomsberry and Lieutenant Bronsfield\r\nentered an eight-pared cutter, which soon brought them to land.\r\n\r\nThey jumped on to the quay.\r\n\r\n“The telegraph?” they asked, without answering one of the thousand\r\nquestions addressed to them.\r\n\r\nThe officer of the port conducted them to the telegraph office through\r\na concourse of spectators. Blomsberry and Bronsfield entered, while the\r\ncrowd crushed each other at the door.\r\n\r\nSome minutes later a fourfold telegram was sent out—the first to the\r\nNaval Secretary at Washington; the second to the vice-president of the\r\nGun Club, Baltimore; the third to the Hon. J. T. Maston, Long’s Peak,\r\nRocky Mountains; and the fourth to the sub-director of the Cambridge\r\nObservatory, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt was worded as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 20° 7′ north latitude, and 41° 37′ west longitude, on the 12th of\r\nDecember, at seventeen minutes past one in the morning, the projectile\r\nof the Columbiad fell into the Pacific. Send instructions.—BLOMSBERRY,\r\nCommander Susquehanna.\r\n\r\nFive minutes afterward the whole town of San Francisco learned the\r\nnews. Before six in the evening the different States of the Union had\r\nheard the great catastrophe; and after midnight, by the cable, the\r\nwhole of Europe knew the result of the great American experiment. We\r\nwill not attempt to picture the effect produced on the entire world by\r\nthat unexpected denouement.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the telegram the Naval Secretary telegraphed to the\r\nSusquehanna to wait in the bay of San Francisco without extinguishing\r\nher fires. Day and night she must be ready to put to sea.\r\n\r\nThe Cambridge observatory called a special meeting; and, with that\r\ncomposure which distinguishes learned bodies in general, peacefully\r\ndiscussed the scientific bearings of the question. At the Gun Club\r\nthere was an explosion. All the gunners were assembled. Vice-President\r\nthe Hon. Wilcome was in the act of reading the premature dispatch, in\r\nwhich J. T. Maston and Belfast announced that the projectile had just\r\nbeen seen in the gigantic reflector of Long’s Peak, and also that it\r\nwas held by lunar attraction, and was playing the part of under\r\nsatellite to the lunar world.\r\n\r\nWe know the truth on that point.\r\n\r\nBut on the arrival of Blomsberry’s dispatch, so decidely contradicting\r\nJ. T. Maston’s telegram, two parties were formed in the bosom of the\r\nGun Club. On one side were those who admitted the fall of the\r\nprojectile, and consequently the return of the travelers; on the other,\r\nthose who believed in the observations of Long’s Peak, concluded that\r\nthe commander of the Susquehanna had made a mistake. To the latter the\r\npretended projectile was nothing but a meteor! nothing but a meteor, a\r\nshooting globe, which in its fall had smashed the bows of the corvette.\r\nIt was difficult to answer this argument, for the speed with which it\r\nwas animated must have made observation very difficult. The commander\r\nof the Susquehanna and her officers might have made a mistake in all\r\ngood faith; one argument however, was in their favor, namely, that if\r\nthe projectile had fallen on the earth, its place of meeting with the\r\nterrestrial globe could only take place on this 27° north latitude, and\r\n(taking into consideration the time that had elapsed, and the rotary\r\nmotion of the earth) between the 41° and the 42° of west longitude. In\r\nany case, it was decided in the Gun Club that Blomsberry brothers,\r\nBilsby, and Major Elphinstone should go straight to San Francisco, and\r\nconsult as to the means of raising the projectile from the depths of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThese devoted men set off at once; and the railroad, which will soon\r\ncross the whole of Central America, took them as far as St. Louis,\r\nwhere the swift mail-coaches awaited them. Almost at the same moment in\r\nwhich the Secretary of Marine, the vice-president of the Gun Club, and\r\nthe sub-director of the Observatory received the dispatch from San\r\nFrancisco, the Honorable J. T. Maston was undergoing the greatest\r\nexcitement he had ever experienced in his life, an excitement which\r\neven the bursting of his pet gun, which had more than once nearly cost\r\nhim his life, had not caused him. We may remember that the secretary of\r\nthe Gun Club had started soon after the projectile (and almost as\r\nquickly) for the station on Long’s Peak, in the Rocky Mountains, J.\r\nBelfast, director of the Cambridge Observatory, accompanying him.\r\nArrived there, the two friends had installed themselves at once, never\r\nquitting the summit of their enormous telescope. We know that this\r\ngigantic instrument had been set up according to the reflecting system,\r\ncalled by the English “front view.” This arrangement subjected all\r\nobjects to but one reflection, making the view consequently much\r\nclearer; the result was that, when they were taking observation, J. T.\r\nMaston and Belfast were placed in the _upper_ part of the instrument\r\nand not in the lower, which they reached by a circular staircase, a\r\nmasterpiece of lightness, while below them opened a metal well\r\nterminated by the metallic mirror, which measured two hundred and\r\neighty feet in depth.\r\n\r\nIt was on a narrow platform placed above the telescope that the two\r\nsavants passed their existence, execrating the day which hid the moon\r\nfrom their eyes, and the clouds which obstinately veiled her during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was their delight when, after some days of waiting, on the\r\nnight of the 5th of December, they saw the vehicle which was bearing\r\ntheir friends into space! To this delight succeeded a great deception,\r\nwhen, trusting to a cursory observation, they launched their first\r\ntelegram to the world, erroneously affirming that the projectile had\r\nbecome a satellite of the moon, gravitating in an immutable orbit.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment it had never shown itself to their eyes—a\r\ndisappearance all the more easily explained, as it was then passing\r\nbehind the moon’s invisible disc; but when it was time for it to\r\nreappear on the visible disc, one may imagine the impatience of the\r\nfuming J. T. Maston and his not less impatient companion. Each minute\r\nof the night they thought they saw the projectile once more, and they\r\ndid not see it. Hence constant discussions and violent disputes between\r\nthem, Belfast affirming that the projectile could not be seen, J. T.\r\nMaston maintaining that “it had put his eyes out.”\r\n\r\n“It is the projectile!” repeated J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Belfast; “it is an avalanche detached from a lunar\r\nmountain.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we shall see it to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“No, we shall not see it any more. It is carried into space.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\nAnd at these moments, when contradictions rained like hail, the\r\nwell-known irritability of the secretary of the Gun Club constituted a\r\npermanent danger for the Honorable Belfast. The existence of these two\r\ntogether would soon have become impossible; but an unforseen event cut\r\nshort their everlasting discussions.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, from the 14th to the 15th of December, the two\r\nirreconcilable friends were busy observing the lunar disc, J. T. Maston\r\nabusing the learned Belfast as usual, who was by his side; the\r\nsecretary of the Gun Club maintaining for the thousandth time that he\r\nhad just seen the projectile, and adding that he could see Michel\r\nArdan’s face looking through one of the scuttles, at the same time\r\nenforcing his argument by a series of gestures which his formidable\r\nhook rendered very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Belfast’s servant appeared on the platform (it was ten\r\nat night) and gave him a dispatch. It was the commander of the\r\nSusquehanna’s telegram.\r\n\r\nBelfast tore the envelope and read, and uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n“What!” said J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“The projectile!”\r\n\r\n“Well!”\r\n\r\n“Has fallen to the earth!”\r\n\r\nAnother cry, this time a perfect howl, answered him. He turned toward\r\nJ. T. Maston. The unfortunate man, imprudently leaning over the metal\r\ntube, had disappeared in the immense telescope. A fall of two hundred\r\nand eighty feet! Belfast, dismayed, rushed to the orifice of the\r\nreflector.\r\n\r\nHe breathed. J. T. Maston, caught by his metal hook, was holding on by\r\none of the rings which bound the telescope together, uttering fearful\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nBelfast called. Help was brought, tackle was let down, and they hoisted\r\nup, not without some trouble, the imprudent secretary of the Gun Club.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared at the upper orifice without hurt.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said he, “if I had broken the mirror?”\r\n\r\n“You would have paid for it,” replied Belfast severely.\r\n\r\n“And that cursed projectile has fallen?” asked J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“Into the Pacific!”\r\n\r\n“Let us go!”\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour after the two savants were descending the\r\ndeclivity of the Rocky Mountains; and two days after, at the same time\r\nas their friends of the Gun Club, they arrived at San Francisco, having\r\nkilled five horses on the road.\r\n\r\nElphinstone, the brothers Blomsberry, and Bilsby rushed toward them on\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” they exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Fish up the projectile,” replied J. T. Maston, “and the sooner the\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nRECOVERED FROM THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spot where the projectile sank under the waves was exactly known;\r\nbut the machinery to grasp it and bring it to the surface of the ocean\r\nwas still wanting. It must first be invented, then made. American\r\nengineers could not be troubled with such trifles. The grappling-irons\r\nonce fixed, by their help they were sure to raise it in spite of its\r\nweight, which was lessened by the density of the liquid in which it was\r\nplunged.\r\n\r\nBut fishing-up the projectile was not the only thing to be thought of.\r\nThey must act promptly in the interest of the travelers. No one doubted\r\nthat they were still living.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” repeated J. T. Maston incessantly, whose confidence gained over\r\neverybody, “our friends are clever people, and they cannot have fallen\r\nlike simpletons. They are alive, quite alive; but we must make haste if\r\nwe wish to find them so. Food and water do not trouble me; they have\r\nenough for a long while. But air, air, that is what they will soon\r\nwant; so quick, quick!”\r\n\r\nAnd they did go quick. They fitted up the Susquehanna for her new\r\ndestination. Her powerful machinery was brought to bear upon the\r\nhauling-chains. The aluminum projectile only weighed 19,250 pounds, a\r\nweight very inferior to that of the transatlantic cable which had been\r\ndrawn up under similar conditions. The only difficulty was in fishing\r\nup a cylindro-conical projectile, the walls of which were so smooth as\r\nto offer no hold for the hooks. On that account Engineer Murchison\r\nhastened to San Francisco, and had some enormous grappling-irons fixed\r\non an automatic system, which would never let the projectile go if it\r\nonce succeeded in seizing it in its powerful claws. Diving-dresses were\r\nalso prepared, which through this impervious covering allowed the\r\ndivers to observe the bottom of the sea. He also had put on board an\r\napparatus of compressed air very cleverly designed. There were perfect\r\nchambers pierced with scuttles, which, with water let into certain\r\ncompartments, could draw it down into great depths. These apparatuses\r\nwere at San Francisco, where they had been used in the construction of\r\na submarine breakwater; and very fortunately it was so, for there was\r\nno time to construct any. But in spite of the perfection of the\r\nmachinery, in spite of the ingenuity of the savants entrusted with the\r\nuse of them, the success of the operation was far from being certain.\r\nHow great were the chances against them, the projectile being 20,000\r\nfeet under the water! And if even it was brought to the surface, how\r\nwould the travelers have borne the terrible shock which 20,000 feet of\r\nwater had perhaps not sufficiently broken? At any rate they must act\r\nquickly. J. T. Maston hurried the workmen day and night. He was ready\r\nto don the diving-dress himself, or try the air apparatus, in order to\r\nreconnoiter the situation of his courageous friends.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all the diligence displayed in preparing the different\r\nengines, in spite of the considerable sum placed at the disposal of the\r\nGun Club by the Government of the Union, five long days (five\r\ncenturies!) elapsed before the preparations were complete. During this\r\ntime public opinion was excited to the highest pitch. Telegrams were\r\nexchanged incessantly throughout the entire world by means of wires and\r\nelectric cables. The saving of Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel Ardan was\r\nan international affair. Every one who had subscribed to the Gun Club\r\nwas directly interested in the welfare of the travelers.\r\n\r\nAt length the hauling-chains, the air-chambers, and the automatic\r\ngrappling-irons were put on board. J. T. Maston, Engineer Murchison,\r\nand the delegates of the Gun Club, were already in their cabins. They\r\nhad but to start, which they did on the 21st of December, at eight\r\no’clock at night, the corvette meeting with a beautiful sea, a\r\nnortheasterly wind, and rather sharp cold. The whole population of San\r\nFrancisco was gathered on the quay, greatly excited but silent,\r\nreserving their hurrahs for the return. Steam was fully up, and the\r\nscrew of the Susquehanna carried them briskly out of the bay.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to relate the conversations on board between the\r\nofficers, sailors, and passengers. All these men had but one thought.\r\nAll these hearts beat under the same emotion. While they were hastening\r\nto help them, what were Barbicane and his companions doing? What had\r\nbecome of them? Were they able to attempt any bold maneuver to regain\r\ntheir liberty? None could say. The truth is that every attempt must\r\nhave failed! Immersed nearly four miles under the ocean, this metal\r\nprison defied every effort of its prisoners.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd inst., at eight in the morning, after a rapid passage, the\r\nSusquehanna was due at the fatal spot. They must wait till twelve to\r\ntake the reckoning exactly. The buoy to which the sounding line had\r\nbeen lashed had not yet been recognized.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, Captain Blomsberry, assisted by his officers who\r\nsuperintended the observations, took the reckoning in the presence of\r\nthe delegates of the Gun Club. Then there was a moment of anxiety. Her\r\nposition decided, the Susquehanna was found to be some minutes westward\r\nof the spot where the projectile had disappeared beneath the waves.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s course was then changed so as to reach this exact point.\r\n\r\nAt forty-seven minutes past twelve they reached the buoy; it was in\r\nperfect condition, and must have shifted but little.\r\n\r\n“At last!” exclaimed J. T. Maston.\r\n\r\n“Shall we begin?” asked Captain Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n“Without losing a second.”\r\n\r\nEvery precaution was taken to keep the corvette almost completely\r\nmotionless. Before trying to seize the projectile, Engineer Murchison\r\nwanted to find its exact position at the bottom of the ocean. The\r\nsubmarine apparatus destined for this expedition was supplied with air.\r\nThe working of these engines was not without danger, for at 20,000 feet\r\nbelow the surface of the water, and under such great pressure, they\r\nwere exposed to fracture, the consequences of which would be dreadful.\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston, the brothers Blomsberry, and Engineer Murchison, without\r\nheeding these dangers, took their places in the air-chamber. The\r\ncommander, posted on his bridge, superintended the operation, ready to\r\nstop or haul in the chains on the slightest signal. The screw had been\r\nshipped, and the whole power of the machinery collected on the capstan\r\nwould have quickly drawn the apparatus on board. The descent began at\r\ntwenty-five minutes past one at night, and the chamber, drawn under by\r\nthe reservoirs full of water, disappeared from the surface of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThe emotion of the officers and sailors on board was now divided\r\nbetween the prisoners in the projectile and the prisoners in the\r\nsubmarine apparatus. As to the latter, they forgot themselves, and,\r\nglued to the windows of the scuttles, attentively watched the liquid\r\nmass through which they were passing.\r\n\r\nThe descent was rapid. At seventeen minutes past two, J. T. Maston and\r\nhis companions had reached the bottom of the Pacific; but they saw\r\nnothing but an arid desert, no longer animated by either fauna or\r\nflora. By the light of their lamps, furnished with powerful reflectors,\r\nthey could see the dark beds of the ocean for a considerable extent of\r\nview, but the projectile was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe impatience of these bold divers cannot be described, and having an\r\nelectrical communication with the corvette, they made a signal already\r\nagreed upon, and for the space of a mile the Susquehanna moved their\r\nchamber along some yards above the bottom.\r\n\r\nThus they explored the whole submarine plain, deceived at every turn by\r\noptical illusions which almost broke their hearts. Here a rock, there a\r\nprojection from the ground, seemed to be the much-sought-for\r\nprojectile; but their mistake was soon discovered, and then they were\r\nin despair.\r\n\r\n“But where are they? where are they?” cried J. T. Maston. And the poor\r\nman called loudly upon Nicholl, Barbicane, and Michel Ardan, as if his\r\nunfortunate friends could either hear or answer him through such an\r\nimpenetrable medium! The search continued under these conditions until\r\nthe vitiated air compelled the divers to ascend.\r\n\r\nThe hauling in began about six in the evening, and was not ended before\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” said J. T. Maston, as he set foot on the bridge of the\r\ncorvette.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Captain Blomsberry.\r\n\r\n“And on another spot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nJ. T. Maston did not doubt of their final success, but his companions,\r\nno longer upheld by the excitement of the first hours, understood all\r\nthe difficulty of the enterprise. What seemed easy at San Francisco,\r\nseemed here in the wide ocean almost impossible. The chances of success\r\ndiminished in rapid proportion; and it was from chance alone that the\r\nmeeting with the projectile might be expected.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 24th, in spite of the fatigue of the previous day,\r\nthe operation was renewed. The corvette advanced some minutes to\r\nwestward, and the apparatus, provided with air, bore the same explorers\r\nto the depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe whole day passed in fruitless research; the bed of the sea was a\r\ndesert. The 25th brought no other result, nor the 26th.\r\n\r\nIt was disheartening. They thought of those unfortunates shut up in the\r\nprojectile for twenty-six days. Perhaps at that moment they were\r\nexperiencing the first approach of suffocation; that is, if they had\r\nescaped the dangers of their fall. The air was spent, and doubtless\r\nwith the air all their _morale_.\r\n\r\n“The air, possibly,” answered J. T. Maston resolutely, “but their\r\n_morale_ never!”\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, after two more days of search, all hope was gone. This\r\nprojectile was but an atom in the immensity of the ocean. They must\r\ngive up all idea of finding it.\r\n\r\nBut J. T. Maston would not hear of going away. He would not abandon the\r\nplace without at least discovering the tomb of his friends. But\r\nCommander Blomsberry could no longer persist, and in spite of the\r\nexclamations of the worthy secretary, was obliged to give the order to\r\nsail.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, at nine A.M., the Susquehanna, heading\r\nnortheast, resumed her course to the bay of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nIt was ten in the morning; the corvette was under half-steam, as it was\r\nregretting to leave the spot where the catastrophe had taken place,\r\nwhen a sailor, perched on the main-top-gallant crosstrees, watching the\r\nsea, cried suddenly:\r\n\r\n“A buoy on the lee bow!”\r\n\r\nThe officers looked in the direction indicated, and by the help of\r\ntheir glasses saw that the object signalled had the appearance of one\r\nof those buoys which are used to mark the passages of bays or rivers.\r\nBut, singularly to say, a flag floating on the wind surmounted its\r\ncone, which emerged five or six feet out of water. This buoy shone\r\nunder the rays of the sun as if it had been made of plates of silver.\r\nCommander Blomsberry, J. T. Maston, and the delegates of the Gun Club\r\nwere mounted on the bridge, examining this object straying at random on\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nAll looked with feverish anxiety, but in silence. None dared give\r\nexpression to the thoughts which came to the minds of all.\r\n\r\nThe corvette approached to within two cables’ lengths of the object.\r\n\r\nA shudder ran through the whole crew. That flag was the American flag!\r\n\r\nAt this moment a perfect howling was heard; it was the brave J. T.\r\nMaston who had just fallen all in a heap. Forgetting on the one hand\r\nthat his right arm had been replaced by an iron hook, and on the other\r\nthat a simple gutta-percha cap covered his brain-box, he had given\r\nhimself a formidable blow.\r\n\r\nThey hurried toward him, picked him up, restored him to life. And what\r\nwere his first words?\r\n\r\n“Ah! trebly brutes! quadruply idiots! quintuply boobies that we are!”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” exclaimed everyone around him.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Come, speak!”\r\n\r\n“It is, simpletons,” howled the terrible secretary, “it is that the\r\nprojectile only weighs 19,250 pounds!”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“And that it displaces twenty-eight tons, or in other words 56,000\r\npounds, and that consequently _it floats_!”\r\n\r\nAh! what stress the worthy man had laid on the verb “float!” And it was\r\ntrue! All, yes! all these savants had forgotten this fundamental law,\r\nnamely, that on account of its specific lightness, the projectile,\r\nafter having been drawn by its fall to the greatest depths of the\r\nocean, must naturally return to the surface. And now it was floating\r\nquietly at the mercy of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe boats were put to sea. J. T. Maston and his friends had rushed into\r\nthem! Excitement was at its height! Every heart beat loudly while they\r\nadvanced to the projectile. What did it contain? Living or dead?\r\n\r\nLiving, yes! living, at least unless death had struck Barbicane and his\r\ntwo friends since they had hoisted the flag. Profound silence reigned\r\non the boats. All were breathless. Eyes no longer saw. One of the\r\nscuttles of the projectile was open. Some pieces of glass remained in\r\nthe frame, showing that it had been broken. This scuttle was actually\r\nfive feet above the water.\r\n\r\nA boat came alongside, that of J. T. Maston, and J. T. Maston rushed to\r\nthe broken window.\r\n\r\nAt that moment they heard a clear and merry voice, the voice of Michel\r\nArdan, exclaiming in an accent of triumph:\r\n\r\n“White all, Barbicane, white all!”\r\n\r\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, and Nicholl were playing at dominoes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may remember the intense sympathy which had accompanied the\r\ntravelers on their departure. If at the beginning of the enterprise\r\nthey had excited such emotion both in the old and new world, with what\r\nenthusiasm would they be received on their return! The millions of\r\nspectators which had beset the peninsula of Florida, would they not\r\nrush to meet these sublime adventurers? Those legions of strangers,\r\nhurrying from all parts of the globe toward the American shores, would\r\nthey leave the Union without having seen Barbicane, Nicholl, and Michel\r\nArdan? No! and the ardent passion of the public was bound to respond\r\nworthily to the greatness of the enterprise. Human creatures who had\r\nleft the terrestrial sphere, and returned after this strange voyage\r\ninto celestial space, could not fail to be received as the prophet\r\nElias would be if he came back to earth. To see them first, and then to\r\nhear them, such was the universal longing.\r\n\r\nBarbicane, Michel Ardan, Nicholl, and the delegates of the Gun Club,\r\nreturning without delay to Baltimore, were received with indescribable\r\nenthusiasm. The notes of President Barbicane’s voyage were ready to be\r\ngiven to the public. The New York _Herald_ bought the manuscript at a\r\nprice not yet known, but which must have been very high. Indeed, during\r\nthe publication of “A Journey to the Moon,” the sale of this paper\r\namounted to five millions of copies. Three days after the return of the\r\ntravelers to the earth, the slightest detail of their expedition was\r\nknown. There remained nothing more but to see the heroes of this\r\nsuperhuman enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Barbicane and his friends round the moon had enabled\r\nthem to correct the many admitted theories regarding the terrestrial\r\nsatellite. These savants had observed _de visu_, and under particular\r\ncircumstances. They knew what systems should be rejected, what retained\r\nwith regard to the formation of that orb, its origin, its habitability.\r\nIts past, present, and future had even given up their last secrets. Who\r\ncould advance objections against conscientious observers, who at less\r\nthan twenty-four miles distance had marked that curious mountain of\r\nTycho, the strangest system of lunar orography? How answer those\r\nsavants whose sight had penetrated the abyss of Pluto’s circle? How\r\ncontradict those bold ones whom the chances of their enterprise had\r\nborne over that invisible face of the disc, which no human eye until\r\nthen had ever seen? It was now their turn to impose some limit on that\r\nselenographic science, which had reconstructed the lunar world as\r\nCuvier did the skeleton of a fossil, and say, “The moon _was_ this, a\r\nhabitable world, inhabited before the earth. The moon _is_ that, a\r\nworld uninhabitable, and now uninhabited.”\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the return of its most illustrious member and his two\r\ncompanions, the Gun Club decided upon giving a banquet, but a banquet\r\nworthy of the conquerors, worthy of the American people, and under such\r\nconditions that all the inhabitants of the Union could directly take\r\npart in it.\r\n\r\nAll the head lines of railroads in the States were joined by flying\r\nrails; and on all the platforms, lined with the same flags, and\r\ndecorated with the same ornaments, were tables laid and all served\r\nalike. At certain hours, successively calculated, marked by electric\r\nclocks which beat the seconds at the same time, the population were\r\ninvited to take their places at the banquet tables. For four days, from\r\nthe 5th to the 9th of January, the trains were stopped as they are on\r\nSundays on the railways of the United States, and every road was open.\r\nOne engine only at full speed, drawing a triumphal carriage, had the\r\nright of traveling for those four days on the railroads of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe engine was manned by a driver and a stoker, and bore, by special\r\nfavor, the Hon. J. T. Maston, secretary of the Gun Club. The carriage\r\nwas reserved for President Barbicane, Colonel Nicholl, and Michel\r\nArdan. At the whistle of the driver, amid the hurrahs, and all the\r\nadmiring vociferations of the American language, the train left the\r\nplatform of Baltimore. It traveled at a speed of one hundred and sixty\r\nmiles in the hour. But what was this speed compared with that which had\r\ncarried the three heroes from the mouth of the Columbiad?\r\n\r\nThus they sped from one town to the other, finding whole populations at\r\ntable on their road, saluting them with the same acclamations,\r\nlavishing the same bravos! They traveled in this way through the east\r\nof the Union, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine,\r\nand New Hampshire; the north and west by New York, Ohio, Michigan, and\r\nWisconsin; returning to the south by Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas,\r\nTexas, and Louisiana; they went to the southeast by Alabama and\r\nFlorida, going up by Georgia and the Carolinas, visiting the center by\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and Indiana, and, after quitting the\r\nWashington station, re-entered Baltimore, where for four days one would\r\nhave thought that the United States of America were seated at one\r\nimmense banquet, saluting them simultaneously with the same hurrahs!\r\nThe apotheosis was worthy of these three heroes whom fable would have\r\nplaced in the rank of demigods.\r\n\r\nAnd now will this attempt, unprecedented in the annals of travels, lead\r\nto any practical result? Will direct communication with the moon ever\r\nbe established? Will they ever lay the foundation of a traveling\r\nservice through the solar world? Will they go from one planet to\r\nanother, from Jupiter to Mercury, and after awhile from one star to\r\nanother, from the Polar to Sirius? Will this means of locomotion allow\r\nus to visit those suns which swarm in the firmament?\r\n\r\nTo such questions no answer can be given. But knowing the bold\r\ningenuity of the Anglo-Saxon race, no one would be astonished if the\r\nAmericans seek to make some use of President Barbicane’s attempt.\r\n\r\nThus, some time after the return of the travelers, the public received\r\nwith marked favor the announcement of a company, limited, with a\r\ncapital of a hundred million of dollars, divided into a hundred\r\nthousand shares of a thousand dollars each, under the name of the\r\n“National Company of Interstellary Communication.” President,\r\nBarbicane; vice-president, Captain Nicholl; secretary, J. T. Maston;\r\ndirector of movements, Michel Ardan.\r\n\r\nAnd as it is part of the American temperament to foresee everything in\r\nbusiness, even failure, the Honorable Harry Trolloppe, judge\r\ncommissioner, and Francis Drayton, magistrate, were nominated\r\nbeforehand!\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n******* Notes: Jules Verne’s “From the Earth to the Moon” and “A Trip\r\nAround It”\r\n\r\nI originally intended to “correct” some of the numbers in the book. For\r\nexample, page 207 has “thirteenth” where “thirtieth” would be more\r\nappropriate. Some of the densities and volumes and masses don’t match\r\nup. The business with the wrong exhaust velocity of the gun is also a\r\nbit confusing. The dates and times aren’t quite consistent throughout,\r\nalthough they are close enough that Verne must have been working from a\r\ntime-line. For example, I think he has the time for the fall back to\r\nearth exactly matching the time for the trip out. There are also\r\ninconsistent spellings, for example “aluminum” and “aluminium”. Some of\r\nthese annoyed me, in the sense of disturbing my reading; since the\r\nreader is reading for pleasure, the annoyance should be removed.\r\n\r\nAll cases of the British? spelling of aluminium have been changed to\r\nthe American spelling aluminum.\r\n\r\nI decided that the correction project was going to be a lot of trouble,\r\nand might be a perversion of the original work. I concentrated instead\r\non producing an accurate rendition of the text. However, if a French\r\nspeaker can find a French edition, it might be nice to see if the\r\ntranslators introduced errors. The measurements seem to have been\r\nconverted from metric without regard for significant figures.\r\nOccasional conversions are simply omitted, with “feet” inserted for\r\n“meters” without fixing the numbers. These might be safely recomputed\r\nwithout doing violence to the spirit of the original work. Whether one\r\nshould standardize the spelling of “aluminium” I don’t know.\r\n“Aluminium” has a certain charm. I don’t know what American or English\r\nusage was at the time. We might consider converting all the\r\ntemperatures to Fahrenheit. I suggest removing the page numbers,\r\nundoing all the hyphenation, and repackaging the lines at a length of\r\n(up to) 72 characters, with only occasional word breaks.\r\n\r\nPage #s and a full reformating has been done. Line widow/orphans have\r\nbeen painstakingly removed. Hypenated words at the end of lines have\r\nbeen eliminated to the best of my judgement.\r\n\r\nI think a table of units should be offered for the reader.\r\nmyriameter = 10 km\r\nfathom = 6 feet; league ~ 3 miles, but don’t know French usage in 1865.\r\npage 125 has perigee 86,410 leagues (French), or 238,833 miles <mean>\r\nWould be nice to know the currency conversions of the day.\r\n\r\nWe may criticize Verne for his errors, but the remarkable thing is how\r\nmuch he got right! I think this was the first engineering proposal for\r\nspace travel, using physics instead of magic. Verne deserves much of\r\nthe credit for inspiring the early rocket pioneers, and ultimately\r\ntoday’s space program. As “literary” history, I note that Heinlein’s\r\n“The Man Who Sold the Moon” borrows from it.\r\n\r\nadd conversion table for units. fathom, league, meter, mile, foot, C/F\r\ncontact publisher for translator information\r\nis perihelium {sic} a real word? maybe substitute perihelion?\r\n\r\nI have changed the one case of perihelium to the correct perihelion.\r\n\r\nThere’s an incorrect reference to Nov. 30 in the early part of book 2\r\nto fix [I read it over and left it there. Close enough for fiction, but\r\nI am sure they would have missed the moon by a lot.]\r\n\r\nDates were not fixed.\r\n\r\ninconsistent spelling of Palliser, Palisser\r\n\r\nThis only occurs twice in the book, so both are left in.\r\n\r\npyroxyle sometimes with xile\r\n\r\n‘yle’ ending was accepted by undisputed “majority rule”\r\n\r\naluminum and aluminium\r\n\r\nThe former accepted.\r\n\r\nmaybe 18000 instead of 17000 yards/sec?\r\n30th degree of lunar latitude instead of 13th?\r\nthere seems to be an inconsistency in the title for book 2\r\n\r\nNumbers, units, dates, times and math errors have NOT been changed.\r\n\r\nTypographic conventions in the book:\r\nThe book uses ligatures for ff fi fl ffi ffl; I have simply spelled\r\nthese out.\r\nChapter N is in italics.\r\nThe chapter titles are in small caps.\r\nThe first word of each chapter has an oversize capital, and the rest of\r\nthe word is in small caps. If the first word is two letters or less,\r\nthe second word is also in small caps.\r\nAM and PM are always in small caps, as A.M. or P.M.\r\n\r\nAll these have been changed to PG standards.\r\n\r\nMy typographic conventions:\r\nThere are a few lines longer than 80 character, usually because I have\r\ninserted a {sic phrase} in the line. I am using % as a line-break\r\ncharacter in these cases; the % and the following new-line should be\r\ndeleted. {correction} I have indicated some candidates for correction\r\nin braces.\r\n\r\nAll these were appreciated! and either corrected or ignored.\r\n\r\n_italics_ are marked with underbars\r\n\r\nThese are left in for the next proofer to turn into CAPS for PG.\r\n\r\n#SMALL CAPS# are enclosed in hash-marks\r\n#\r\n$ae $’e dollar-sign preceeds ligatures and accented characters.\r\nThe accent follows the $ and precedes the letter. I’ve tried to get ’\r\nand ‘ (as accents) right.\r\nI have used : as an accent marker for umlaut.\r\n\r\nAll are removed.\r\n\r\nI’ve used ‘ and ’ to enclose (recursive) quotes. Ascii has no provision\r\nfor distinguishable open and close doublequotes.\r\nThe book uses ligatures for ff fi fl ffi ffl; I have simply spelled\r\nthese out.\r\nL for British Pound.\r\n\r\nAll these conventions (except the circumflex) have been accepted.\r\n\r\nbold indicates a different typeface\r\n\r\nRemoved (only one case) and probably a printers error?\r\n\r\nδ indicates a non-ascii character, here the greek letter delta left in.",
