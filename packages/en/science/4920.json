A mere matter of news.” Suppose I use them in\r\nthe same sense:\r\n\r\nA mere matter of news: The first instalment of this fabulous novel was\r\nfeatured in Argosy-All-Story-Weekly for May 14, 1921. Described as a\r\n“different” serial, it was introduced by a cover by Modest Stein. In\r\nthe foreground was the profile of a girl of another dimension--ethereal,\r\nsensuous, the eternal feminine--the Nervina of the story. Filmy\r\ncrystalline earrings swept back over her bare shoulders. Dominating the\r\nbackground was a huge flaming yellow ball, like our Sun as seen from the\r\nhypothetical Vulcan--splotched with murky, mysterious globii vitonae.\r\nThere was an ancient quay, and emerging from the ultramarine waters\r\nabout it a silhouetted metropolis of spires, domes, and minarets. It was\r\n1921, and that generation thus received its first glimpse of the alien\r\nlandscape of The Blind Spot and the baroque beauty of an immortal woman\r\nof fantasy fiction.\r\n\r\nThe authors? Homer Eon Flint was already a reigning favourite with\r\npost-World-War-I enthusiasts of imaginative literature, who had eagerly\r\ndevoured his QUEEN OF LIFE and LORD OF DEATH, his KING OF CONSERVE\r\nISLAND and THE PLANETEER. Austin Hall was well known and popular for his\r\nALMOST IMMORTAL, REBEL SOUL, and INTO THE INFINITE.\r\n\r\nThen came this epoch-making collaboration. When Mary Gnaedinger launched\r\nFamous Fantastic Mysteries magazine she early presented THE BLIND SPOT,\r\nand printed it again in that magazine's companion Fantastic Novels.\r\nThese reprints are now collectors' items, almost unobtainable,\r\nand otherwise the story has long been out of print. Rumour says an\r\nunauthorised German version of THE BLIND SPOT, has been published in\r\nbook form. There is another book called THE BLIND SPOT, and also a\r\nmagazine story, and a major movie studio was to produce a film of the\r\nsame title. However, here is presented the only hard-cover version of\r\nthe only BLIND SPOT of consequence to lovers of fantasy.\r\n\r\nWho wrote the story? When I first looked into the question, as a 15 year\r\nold boy, Homer Eon Flint (he originally spelled his name with a “d”)\r\nwas already dead of a fall into a canyon. In 1949 his widow told me: “I\r\nthink Homer's father contributed that middle name”--the same name (with\r\nslightly different spelling) that the Irish poet George Russell took\r\nas his pen-name, which became known by its abbreviation AE. Mrs. Flindt\r\nsaid of Flint's father: “He was a very deep thinker, and enjoyed reading\r\nheavy material.” Like father, like son. “Homer always talked over his\r\nideas with me, and although I couldn't always follow his thoughts it\r\nseemed to help him to express them to another--it made some things come\r\nmore clearly to him.”\r\n\r\nFlint was a great admirer of H. G. Wells (this little\r\ngrandmother-schoolteacher told me) and had probably read all his works\r\nup to the time when he (Flint) died in 1924. He had read Doyle and\r\nHaggard, but: “Wells was his favourite--the real thinker.”\r\n\r\nFlint found a fellow-thinker in Austin Hall, whom he met in San\r\nJose, California, while working at a shop where shoes were repaired\r\nelectrically--“a rather new concept at the time.” Hall, learning that\r\nFlint lived in the same city, sought him out, and they became fast\r\nfriends. Each stimulated the other. As Hall told me twenty years ago of\r\nthe origin of THE BLIND SPOT:\r\n\r\n“One day after we had lunched together, I held my finger up in front of\r\none of my eyes and said: 'Homer, couldn't a story be written about that\r\nblind spot in the eye?' Not much was said about it at the time, but four\r\ndays later, again at lunch, I outlined the whole story to him. I wrote\r\nthe first eighteen chapters; Homer took up the tale as 'Hobart Fenton'\r\nand wrote the chapters about the house of miracles, the living death,\r\nthe rousing of Aradna's mind, and so forth, up to 'The Man from Space,'\r\nwhere once again I took over.”\r\n\r\nTo THE BLIND SPOT Hall contributed a great knowledge of history and\r\nanthropology, while Flint's fortes were physics and medicine. Both had a\r\ngreat fund of philosophy at their command.\r\n\r\nWhen I met Hall (about four years older than Flint) he was in his\r\nfifties: a devil-may-care old codger (old to a fifteen-year-old, that\r\nis) full of good humour and indulgence for a youthful admirer who had\r\njourneyed far to meet him. He casually referred to his 600 published\r\nstories, and I carried away the impression of one who resembled both\r\nin output and in looks that other fiction-factory of the time, Edgar\r\nWallace.\r\n\r\nFinally: Several years ago, before I knew anything about the present\r\nvolume, I had an unusual experience. (At that time I had no reason to\r\nthink THE BLIND SPOT would ever become available as a book, for the\r\nlocation of the heirs proved a Herculean task by itself; publishers had\r\nlong wanted to present this amazing novel but could not do so until I\r\nlocated Mrs. Mae Hall and Mrs. Mabel Flindt.) While, unfortunately, I\r\ndid not take careful notes at the time, the gist of the occurrence was\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nI visited a friend whose hobby (besides reading fantasy) was the\r\noccult, who volunteered to entertain me with automatic writing and\r\nthe ouija-board. Now, I share Lovecraft's scepticism towards the\r\nsupernatural, regarding it as at best a means of amusement. When the\r\nquestion arose of what spirits we should try to lure to our planchette,\r\nthe names of Lovecraft, Merritt, Hall, and Flint popped into my\r\npixilated mind. So I set my fingers on the wooden heart and, since my\r\nhost was also a Flint admirer, we asked about Flint's fatal accident.\r\nThe ouija spelled out:\r\n\r\nN-O A-C-C-I-D-E-N-T--R-O-B-B-E-R-Y\r\n\r\nThere followed something about being held up by a hitch-hiker. Then Hall\r\n(or at least some energy-source other than my own conscious mind) came\r\nthrough too, and when I asked if he had left any work behind he replied:\r\n\r\nY-E-S--T-H-E L-A-S-T G-O-D-L-I-N-G\r\n\r\nLater I asked his son about this (without revealing the title) and Javen\r\nHall told me of the story his father had been plotting when he died: THE\r\nHIDDEN EMPIRE, or THE CHILD OF THE SOUTHWIND. Whatever was pushing the\r\nplanchette failed to inform me that when I found Austin Hall's son and\r\nwidow, they would put into my hands an unknown, unpublished fantasy\r\nnovel by Hall: THE HOUSE OF DAWN! Some day it may appear in print.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile you are getting understandably impatient to explore that\r\nunknown realm of the Blind Spot. Be on your way, and bon voyage!\r\n\r\nFORREST J ACKERMAN, Beverley Hills, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\nPerhaps it were just as well to start at the beginning. A mere matter of\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nAll the world at the time knew the story; but for the benefit of those\r\nwho have forgotten I shall repeat it. I am merely giving it as I have\r\ntaken it from the papers with no elaboration and no opinion--a mere\r\nstatement of facts. It was a celebrated case at the time and stirred the\r\nworld to wonder. Indeed, it still is celebrated, though to the layman it\r\nis forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt has been labelled and indexed and filed away in the archives of the\r\nprofession. To those who wish to look it up it will be spoken of as one\r\nof the great unsolved mysteries of the century. A crime that leads two\r\nways, one into murder--sordid, cold and calculating; and the other into\r\nthe nebulous screen that thwarts us from the occult.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is the character of Dr. Holcomb that gives the latter. He was\r\na great man and a splendid thinker. That he should have been led into a\r\nmaze of cheap necromancy is, on the face, improbable. He had a wonderful\r\nmind. For years he had been battering down the scepticism that had\r\nbulwarked itself in the material.\r\n\r\nHe was a psychologist, and up to the day the greatest, perhaps, that we\r\nhave known. He had a way of going out before his fellows--it is the way\r\nof genius--and he had gone far, indeed, before them. If we would trust\r\nDr. Holcomb we have much to live for; our religion is not all hearsay\r\nand there is a great deal in science still unthought of. It is an\r\nunfortunate case; but there is much to be learned in the circumstance\r\nthat led the great doctor into the Blind Spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nRHAMDA AVEC\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a certain foggy morning in September, 1905, a tall man wearing a\r\nblack overcoat and bearing in one hand a small satchel of dark-reddish\r\nleather descended from a Geary Street tram at the foot of Market Street,\r\nSan Francisco. It was a damp morning; a mist was brooding over the city\r\nblurring all distinctness.\r\n\r\nThe man glanced about him; a tall man of trim lines and distinctness\r\nand a quick, decided step and bearing. In the shuffle of descending\r\npassengers he was outstanding, with a certain inborn grace that without\r\nthe blood will never come from training. Men noticed and women out of\r\ninstinct cast curious furtive glances and then turned away; which was\r\nnatural, inasmuch as the man was plainly old. But for all that many\r\nventured a second glance--and wondered.\r\n\r\nAn old man with the poise of twenty, a strange face of remarkable\r\nfeatures, swarthy, of an Eastern cast, perhaps Indian; whatever the\r\ncertainty of the man's age there was still a lingering suggestion\r\nof splendid youth. If one persisted in a third or fourth look this\r\nsuggestion took an almost certain tone, the man's age dwindled, years\r\ndropped from him, and the quizzical smile that played on the lips seemed\r\na foreboding of boyish laughter.\r\n\r\nWe say foreboding because in this case it is not mistaken diction.\r\nForeboding suggests coming evil; the laughter of boys is wholehearted.\r\nIt was merely that things were not exactly as they should be; it was not\r\nnatural that age should be so youthful. The fates were playing, and in\r\nthis case for once in the world's history their play was crosswise.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable case from the beginning and we are starting from\r\nfacts. The man crossed to the window of the Key Route ferry and\r\npurchased a ticket for Berkeley, after which, with the throng, he passed\r\nthe turnstile and on to the boat that was waiting. He took the lower\r\ndeck, not from choice, apparently, but more because the majority of his\r\nfellow passengers, being men, were bound in this direction. The same\r\nchance brought him to the cigar-stand. The men about him purchased\r\ncigars and cigarettes, and as is the habit of all smokers, strolled off\r\nwith delighted relish. The man watched them. Had anyone noticed his eyes\r\nhe would have noted a peculiar colour and a light of surprise. With the\r\nprim step that made him so distinctive he advanced to the news-stand.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me; but I would like to purchase one of those.” Though he spoke\r\nperfect English it was in a strange manner, after the fashion of one\r\nwho has found something that he has just learned how to use. At the\r\nsame time he made a suggestion with his tapered fingers indicating the\r\ntobacco in the case. The clerk looked up.\r\n\r\n“A cigar, sir? Yes, sir. What will it be?”\r\n\r\n“A cigar?” Again the strange articulation. “Ah, yes, that is it. Now\r\nI remember. And it has a little sister, the cigarette. I think I shall\r\ntake a cigarette, if--if--if you will show me how to use it.”\r\n\r\nIt was a strange request. The clerk was accustomed to all manner of\r\nmen and their brands of humour; he was about to answer in kind when he\r\nlooked up and into the man's eyes. He started.\r\n\r\n“You mean,” he asked, “that you have never seen a cigar or cigarette;\r\nthat you do not know how to use them? A man as old as you are.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger laughed. It was rather resentful, but for all that of a\r\nhearty taint of humour.\r\n\r\n“So old? Would you say that I am as old as that; if you will look\r\nagain--”\r\n\r\nThe young man did and what he beheld is something that he could not\r\nquite account for: the strange conviction of this remarkable man; of age\r\nmelting into youth, of an uncertain freshness, the smile, not of sixty,\r\nbut of twenty. The young man was not one to argue, whatever his wonder;\r\nhe was first of all a lad of business; he could merely acquiesce.\r\n\r\n“The first time! This is the first time you have ever seen a cigar or\r\ncigarette?”\r\n\r\nThe stranger nodded.\r\n\r\n“The first time. I have never beheld one of them before this morning. If\r\nyou will allow me?” He indicated a package. “I think I shall take one of\r\nthese.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk took up the package, opened the end, and shook out a single\r\ncigarette. The man lit it and, as the smoke poured out of his mouth,\r\nheld the cigarette tentatively in his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Like it?” It was the clerk who asked.\r\n\r\nThe other did not answer, his whole face was the expression of having\r\njust discovered one of the senses. He was a splendid man and, if the\r\nword may be employed of the sterner sex, one of beauty. His features\r\nwere even; that is to be noted, his nose chiselled straight and to\r\nperfection, the eyes of a peculiar sombreness and lustre almost burning,\r\nof a black of such intensity as to verge into red and to be devoid of\r\npupils, and yet, for all of that, of a glow and softness. After a moment\r\nhe turned to the clerk.\r\n\r\n“You are young, my lad.”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-one, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You are fortunate. You live in a wonderful age. It is as wonderful as\r\nyour tobacco. And you still have many great things before you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe man walked on to the forward part of the boat; leaving the youth,\r\nwho had been in a sort of daze, watching. But it was not for long. The\r\nwhole thing had been strange and to the lad almost inexplicable. The man\r\nwas not insane, he was certain; and he was just as sure that he had not\r\nbeen joking. From the start he had been taken by the man's refinement,\r\nintellect and education. He was positive that he had been sincere. Yet--\r\n\r\nThe ferry detective happened at that moment to be passing. The clerk\r\nmade an indication with his thumb.\r\n\r\n“That man yonder,” he spoke, “the one in black. Watch him.” Then he told\r\nhis story. The detective laughed and walked forward.\r\n\r\nIt was a most fortunate incident. It was a strange case. That mere act\r\nof the cigar clerk placed the police on the track and gave to the world\r\nthe only clue that it holds of the Blind Spot.\r\n\r\nThe detective had laughed at the lad's recital--almost any one had a\r\npatent for being queer--and if this gentleman had a whim for a certain\r\nbrand of humour that was his business. Nevertheless, he would stroll\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe man was not hard to distinguish; he was standing on the forward deck\r\nfacing the wind and peering through the mist at the grey, heavy heave of\r\nthe water. Alongside of them the dim shadow of a sister ferry screamed\r\nits way through the fogbank. That he was a landsman was evidenced by his\r\nway of standing; he was uncertain; at every heave of the boat he would\r\nshift sidewise. An unusually heavy roll caught him slightly off-balance\r\nand jostled him against the detective. The latter held up his hand and\r\ncaught him by the arm.\r\n\r\n“A bad morning,” spoke the officer. “B-r-r-r! Did you notice the Yerbe\r\nBuena yonder? She just grazed us. A bad morning.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger turned. As the detective caught the splendid face, the\r\nglowing eyes and the youthful smile, he started much as had done the\r\ncigar clerk. The same effect of the age melting into youth and--the\r\nofficer being much more accustomed to reading men--a queer sense of\r\nlatent and potent vision. The eyes were soft and receptive but for\r\nall that of the delicate strength and colour that comes from abnormal\r\nintellect. He noted the pupils, black, glowing, of great size, almost\r\nfilling the iris and the whole melting into intensity that verged into\r\nred. Either the man had been long without sleep or he was one of unusual\r\nintelligence and vitality.\r\n\r\n“A nasty morning,” repeated the officer.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Er, yes--did you say it was a nasty morning? Indeed, I do not know,\r\nsir. However, it is very interesting.”\r\n\r\n“Stranger in San Francisco?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes. At least, I have never seen it.”\r\n\r\n“H-m!” The detective was a bit nonplussed by the man's evident evasion.\r\n“Well, if you are a stranger I suppose it is up to me to come to\r\nthe defence of my city. This is one of Frisco's fogs. We have them\r\noccasionally. Sometimes they last for days. This one is a low one.\r\nIt will lift presently. Then you will see the sun. Have you ever seen\r\nFrisco's sun?”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir”--this same slow articulation--“I have never seen your sun\r\nnor any other.”\r\n\r\n“Hum!”\r\n\r\nIt was an answer altogether unexpected. Again the officer found himself\r\ngazing into the strange, refined face and wonderful eyes. The man was\r\nnot blind, of that he was certain. Neither was his voice harsh or testy.\r\nRather was it soft and polite, of one merely stating a fact. Yet how\r\ncould it be? He remembered the cigar clerk. Neither cigar nor sun! From\r\nwhat manner of land could the man come? A detective has a certain\r\ngift of intuition. Though on the face of it, outside of the man's\r\npersonality, there could be nothing to it but a joke, he chose to act\r\nupon the impulse. He pulled back the door which had been closed behind\r\nthem and re-entered the boat. When he returned the boat had arrived at\r\nthe pier.\r\n\r\n“You are going to Oakland?”\r\n\r\nIt was a chance question.\r\n\r\n“No, to Berkeley. I take a train here, I understand. Do all the trains\r\ngo to Berkeley?”\r\n\r\n“By no means. I am going to Berkeley myself. We can ride together. My\r\nname is Jerome. Albert Jerome.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks. Mine is Avec. Rhamda Avec. I am much obliged. Your company may\r\nbe instructive.”\r\n\r\nHe did not say more, but watched with unrestrained interest their\r\nmanoeuvre into the slip. A moment later they were marching with the\r\nothers down the gangways to the trains waiting. Just as they were seated\r\nand the electric train was pulling out of the pier the sun breaking\r\nthrough the mist blazed with splendid light through the cloud rifts. The\r\nstranger was next to the window where he could look out over the water\r\nand beyond at the citied shoreline, whose sea of housetops extended and\r\nrose to the peaks of the first foothills. The sun was just coming over\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nThe detective watched. There was sincerity in the man's actions. It was\r\nnot acting. When the light first broke he turned his eyes full into the\r\nradiance. It was the act of a child and, so it struck the officer, of\r\nthe same trust and simplicity--and likewise the same effect. He drew\r\naway quickly: for the moment blinded.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said. “It is so. This is the sun. Your sun is wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed it is,” returned the other. “But rather common. We see it every\r\nday. It's the whole works, but we get used to it. For myself I cannot\r\nsee anything strange in the 'sun's still shining.' You have been blind,\r\nMr. Avec? Pardon the question. But I must naturally infer. You say you\r\nhave never seen the sun. I suppose--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped because of the other's smile; somehow it seemed a very\r\nsuperior one, as if predicting a wealth of wisdom.\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Jerome,” he spoke, “I have never been blind in my life. I\r\nsay it is wonderful! It is glorious and past describing. So is it all,\r\nyour water, your boats, your ocean. But I see there is one thing even\r\nstranger still. It is yourselves. With all your greatness you are only\r\npart of your surroundings. Do you know what is your sun?”\r\n\r\n“Search me,” returned the officer. “I'm no astronomer. I understand they\r\ndon't know themselves. Fire, I suppose, and a hell of a hot one! But\r\nthere is one thing that I can tell.”\r\n\r\n“And this--”\r\n\r\n“Is the truth.”\r\n\r\nIf he meant it for insinuation it was ineffective. The other smiled\r\nkindly. In the fine effect of the delicate features, and most of all\r\nin the eyes was sincerity. In that face was the mark of genius--he felt\r\nit--and of a potent superior intelligence. Most of all did he note the\r\nbeauty and the soft, silky superlustre of the eyes.\r\n\r\nWe have the whole thing from Jerome, at least this part of it; and our\r\ninterest being retrospect is multiplied far above that of the detective.\r\nThe stranger had a certain call of character and of appearance, not\r\nto say magnetism. The officer felt himself almost believing and\r\nyet restraining himself into caution of unbelief. It was a remark\r\npreposterous on the face of it. What puzzled Jerome was the purpose;\r\nhe could think of nothing that would necessitate such statements and\r\nacting. He was certain that the man was sane.\r\n\r\nIn the light of what came after great stress has been laid by a certain\r\nclass upon this incident. We may say that we lean neither way. We have\r\nmerely given it in some detail because of that importance. We have\r\nyet no proof of the mystic and until it is proved, we must lean, like\r\nJerome, upon the cold material. We have the mystery, but, even at that,\r\nwe have not the certainty of murder.\r\n\r\nUnderstand, it was intuition that led Jerome into that memorable trip to\r\nBerkeley; he happened to be going off duty and was drawn to the man by\r\na chance incident and the fact of his personality. At this minute,\r\nhowever, he thought no more of him than as an eccentric, as some\r\nrefined, strange wonderful gentleman with a whim for his own brand of\r\nhumour. Only that could explain it. The man had an evident curiosity\r\nfor everything about him, the buildings, the street, the cars, and the\r\npeople. Frequently he would mutter: “Wonderful, wonderful, and all the\r\ntime we have never known it. Wonderful!”\r\n\r\nAs they drew into Lorin the officer ventured a question.\r\n\r\n“You have friends in Berkeley? I see you are a stranger. If I may\r\npresume, perhaps I may be of assistance?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, if--if--do you know of a Dr. Holcomb?”\r\n\r\n“You mean the professor. He lives on Dwight Way. At this time of the\r\nday you would be more apt to find him at the university. Is he expecting\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nIt was a blunt question and of course none of his business. Yet,\r\njust what another does not want him to know is ever the pursuit of a\r\ndetective. At the same time the subconscious flashing and wondering at\r\nthe name Rhamda Avec--surely neither Teutonic nor Sanskrit nor anything\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\n“Expecting me? Ah, yes. Pardon me if I speak slowly. I am not quite used\r\nto speech--yet. I see you are interested. After I see Dr. Holcomb I may\r\ntell you. However, it is very urgent that I see the doctor. He--well, I\r\nmay say that we have known each other a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Then you know him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in a way; though we have never met. He must be a great man. We\r\nhave much in common, your doctor and I; and we have a great deal to\r\ngive to your world. However, I would not recognise him should I see him.\r\nWould you by any chance--”\r\n\r\n“You mean would I be your guide? With pleasure. It just happens that I\r\nam on friendly terms with your friend Dr. Holcomb.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now to start in on another angle. There is hardly any necessity for\r\nintroducing Dr. Holcomb. All of us, at least, those who read, and, most\r\nof all, those of us who are interested in any manner of speculation,\r\nknew him quite well. He was the professor of philosophy at the\r\nUniversity of California: a great man and a good one, one of those fine\r\nacademic souls who, not only by their wisdom, but by their character,\r\nhave a way of stamping themselves upon generations; a speaker of the\r\nupstanding class, walking on his own feet and utterly fearless when it\r\ncame to dashing out on some startling philosophy that had not been borne\r\nup by his forebears.\r\n\r\nHe was original. He believed that the philosophies of the ages are but\r\nstepping stones, that the wisdom of the earth looked but to the future,\r\nand that the study of the classics, however essential, is but the ground\r\nwork for combining and working out the problems of the future. He was\r\nepigrammatic, terse, and gifted with a quaint humour, with which he\r\nwas apt, even when in the driest philosophy, to drive in and clinch his\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nBest of all, he was able to clothe the most abstract thoughts in\r\nlanguage so simple and concrete that he brought the deepest of all\r\nsubjects down to the scope of the commonest thinker. It is needless\r\nto say that he was 'copy.' The papers about the bay were ever and anon\r\nrunning some startling story of the professor.\r\n\r\nHad they stuck to the text it would all have been well; but a reporter\r\nis a reporter; in spite of the editors there were numerous little\r\nelaborations to pervert the context. A great man must be careful of his\r\nspeech. Dr. Holcomb was often busy refuting; he could not understand the\r\nneed of these little twistings of wisdom. It kept him in controversy;\r\nthe brothers of his profession often took him to task for these little\r\ndistorted scraps of philosophy. He did not like journalism. He had a way\r\nof consigning all writers and editors to the devil.\r\n\r\nWhich was vastly amusing to the reporters. Once they had him going they\r\npoised their pens in glee and began splashing their venomous ink. It was\r\ntragic; the great professor standing at bay to his tormentors. One and\r\nall they loved him and one and all they took delight in his torture. It\r\nwas a hard task for a reporter to get in at a lecture; and yet it was\r\noften the lot of the professor to find himself and his words featured in\r\nhis breakfast paper.\r\n\r\nOn the very day before this the doctor had come out with one of his\r\nterse startling statements. He had a way of inserting parenthetically\r\nsome of his scraps of wisdom. It was in an Ethics class. We quote his\r\nwords as near as possible:\r\n\r\n“Man, let me tell you, is egotistic. All our philosophy is based on ego.\r\nWe live threescore years and we balance it with all eternity. We are it.\r\nDid you ever stop and think of eternity? It is a rather long time.\r\nWhat right have we to say that life, which we assume to be everlasting,\r\nimmediately becomes restrospect once it passes out of the conscious\r\nindividuality which is allotted upon this earth? The trouble is\r\nourselves. We are five-sensed. We weigh everything! We so measure\r\neternity. Until we step out into other senses, which undoubtedly exist,\r\nwe shall never arrive at the conception of infinity. Now I am going to\r\nmake a rather startling announcement.\r\n\r\n“The past few years have promised a culmination which has been guessed\r\nat and yearned for since the beginning of time. It is within, and still\r\nwithout, the scope of metaphysics. Those of you who have attended my\r\nlectures have heard me call myself the material idealist. I am a\r\nmystic sensationalist. I believe that we can derive nothing from pure\r\ncontemplation. There is mystery and wonder in the veil of the\r\noccult. The earth, our life, is merely a vestibule of the universe.\r\nContemplation alone will hold us all as inapt and as impotent as the\r\nold Monks of Athos. We have mountains of literature behind us, all\r\ncontemplative, and whatever its wisdom, it has given us not one thing\r\noutside the abstract. From Plato down to the present our philosophy\r\nhas given us not one tangible proof, not one concrete fact which we can\r\nplace our hands on. We are virtually where we were originally; and we\r\ncan talk, talk, talk from now until the clap of doomsday.\r\n\r\n“What then?\r\n\r\n“My friends, philosophy must take a step sidewise. In this modern age\r\nyoung science, practical science, has grown up and far surpassed us. We\r\nmust go back to the beginning, forget our subjective musings and enter\r\nthe concrete. We are five-sensed, and in the nature of things we must\r\nbring the proof down into the concrete where we can understand it. Can\r\nwe pierce the nebulous screen that shuts us out of the occult? We have\r\ndoubted, laughed at ourselves and been laughed at; but the fact remains\r\nthat always we have persisted in the believing.\r\n\r\n“I have said that we shall never, never understand infinity while within\r\nthe limitations of our five senses. I repeat it. But that does not imply\r\nthat we shall never solve some of the mystery of life. The occult is not\r\nonly a supposition, but a fact. We have peopled it with terror, because,\r\nlike our forebears before Columbus, we have peopled it with imagination.\r\n\r\n“And now to my statement.\r\n\r\n“I have called myself the Material Idealist. I have adopted an entirely\r\nnew trend of philosophy. During the past years, unknown to you and\r\nunknown to my friends, I have allied myself with practical science. I\r\ndesired something concrete. While my colleagues and others were pounding\r\nout tomes of wonderful sophistry I have been pounding away at the screen\r\nof the occult. This is a proud moment. I have succeeded. Tomorrow I\r\nshall bring to you the fact and the substance. I have lifted up the\r\ncurtain and flooded it with the light of day. You shall have the fact\r\nfor your senses. Tomorrow I shall explain it all. I shall deliver my\r\ngreatest lecture; in which my whole Me has come to a focus. It is not\r\nspiritualism nor sophistry. It is concrete fact and common sense. The\r\nsubject of my lecture tomorrow will be: 'The Blind Spot.'”\r\n\r\nHere begins the second part of the mystery.\r\n\r\nWe know now that the great lecture was never delivered. Immediately the\r\nnews was scattered out of the class-room. It became common property.\r\nIt was spread over the country and was featured in all the great\r\nmetropolitan dailies. In the lecture-room next morning seats were at a\r\npremium; students, professors, instructors and all the prominent people\r\nwho could gain admission crowded into the hall; even the irrepressible\r\nreporters had stolen in to take down the greatest scoop of the century.\r\nThe place was jammed until even standing room was unthought of. The\r\ncrowd, dense and packed and physically uncomfortable, waited.\r\n\r\nThe minutes dragged by. It was a long, long wait. But at last the bell\r\nrang that ticked the hour. Every one was expectant. And then fifteen\r\nminutes passed by, twenty--the crowd settled down to waiting. At length\r\none of the colleagues stepped into the doctor's office and telephoned to\r\nhis home. His daughter answered.\r\n\r\n“Father? Why he left over two hours ago.”\r\n\r\n“About what time?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it was about seven-thirty. You know he was to deliver his lecture\r\ntoday on the Blind Spot. I wanted to hear it, but he told me I could\r\nhave it at home. He said he was to have a wonderful guest and I must\r\nmake ready to receive him. Isn't father there?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. Who was this guest? Did he say?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes! In a way. A most wonderful man. And he gave him a wonderful\r\nname, Rhamda Avec. I remember because it is so funny. I asked father if\r\nhe was Sanskrit; and he said he was much older than that. Just imagine!”\r\n\r\n“Did your father have his lecture with him?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. He glanced over it at breakfast. He told me he was going to\r\nstartle the world as it had never been since the day of Columbus.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And he was terribly impatient. He said he had to be at the college\r\nbefore eight to receive the great man. He was to deliver his lecture at\r\nten. And afterward he would have lunch at noon and he would give me the\r\nwhole story. I'm all impatience.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\nThen he came back and made the announcement that there was a little\r\ndelay; but that Dr. Holcomb would be there shortly. But he was not. At\r\ntwelve o'clock there were still some people waiting. At one o'clock the\r\nlast man had slipped out of the room--and wondered. In all the country\r\nthere was but one person who knew. That one was an obscure man who had\r\nyielded to a detective's intuition and had fallen inadvertently upon one\r\nof the greatest mysteries of modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n“NOW THERE ARE TWO”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story is unfortunately all too easily told. We go back\r\nto Jerome and his strange companion.\r\n\r\nAt Centre Street station they alighted and walked up to the university.\r\nUnder the Le Conte oaks they met the professor. He was trim and happy,\r\nhis short, well-built figure clothed in black, his snow-white whiskers\r\ntrimmed to the usual square crop and his pink skin glowing with splendid\r\nhealth. The fog had by this time lifted and the sun was just beginning\r\nto overcome the chilliness of the air. There was no necessity for an\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nThe two men apparently recognised each other at once. So we have it from\r\nthe detective. There was sincerity in the delight of their hand-clasp. A\r\nstrange pair, both of them with the distinction and poise that come\r\nfrom refinement and intellectual training; though in physique they were\r\nalmost opposite, there was still a strange, almost mutual, bond between\r\nthem. Dr. Holcomb was beaming.\r\n\r\n“At last!” he greeted. “At last! I was sure we could not fail. This, my\r\ndear Dr. Avec, is the greatest day since Columbus.”\r\n\r\nThe other took the hand.\r\n\r\n“So this is the great Dr. Holcomb. Yes, indeed, it is a great day;\r\nthough I know nothing about your Columbus. So far it has been simply\r\nwonderful. I can scarcely credit my senses. So near and yet so far. How\r\ncan it be? A dream? Are you sure, Dr. Holcomb?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Rhamda, I am sure that I am the happiest man that ever lived.\r\nIt is the culmination. I was certain we could not fail; though, of\r\ncourse, to me also it is an almost impossible climax of fact. I should\r\nnever have succeeded without your assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe other smiled.\r\n\r\n“That was of small account, my dear doctor. To yourself must go the\r\ncredit; to me the pleasure. Take your sun, for instance, I--but I have\r\nnot the language to tell you.”\r\n\r\nBut the doctor had gone in to abstraction.\r\n\r\n“A great day,” he was beaming. “A great day! What will the world say? It\r\nis proved.” Then suddenly: “You have eaten?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. You must allow me a bit of time. I thought of it; but I had\r\nnot quite the courage to venture.”\r\n\r\n“Then we shall eat,” said the other man. “Afterward we shall go up to\r\nthe lecture-room. Today I shall deliver my lecture on the Blind Spot.\r\nAnd when I am through you shall deliver the words that will astonish the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\nBut here it seems there was a hitch. The other shook his head kindly.\r\nIt was evident that while the doctor was the leader, the other was a\r\nco-worker who must be considered.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, professor, that you have promised a bit too much. I am not\r\nentirely free yet, you know. Two hours is the most that I can give you;\r\nand not entirely that. There are some details that may not be neglected.\r\nIt is a far venture and now that we have succeeded this far there is\r\nsurely no reason why we cannot go on. However, it is necessary that I\r\nreturn to the house on Chatterton Place. I have but slightly over an\r\nhour left.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor was plainly disappointed.\r\n\r\n“But the lecture?”\r\n\r\n“It means my life, professor, and the subsequent success of our\r\nexperiment. A few details, a few minutes. Perhaps if we hurry we can get\r\nback in time.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor glanced at his watch. “Twenty minutes for the train, twenty\r\nminutes for the boat, ten minutes; that's an hour, two hours. These\r\ndetails? Have you any idea how long, Rhamda?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not more than fifteen minutes.”\r\n\r\n“We have still two hours. Fifteen minutes; perhaps a little bit late.\r\nTell you what. I shall go with you. You can get on the boat.”\r\n\r\nWe have said that the detective had intuition. He had it still. Yet\r\nhe had no rational reason for suspecting either the professor or his\r\nstrange companion. Furthermore he had never heard of the Blind Spot\r\nin any way whatsoever; nor did he know a single thing of philosophy\r\nor anything else in Holcomb's teaching. He knew the doctor as a man\r\nof eminent standing and respectability. It was hardly natural that he\r\nshould suspect anything sinister to grow out of this meeting of two\r\nrefined scholars. He attached no great importance to the trend of their\r\nconversation. It was strange, to be sure; but he felt, no doubt, that\r\nliving in their own world they had a way and a language of their own. He\r\nwas no scholar.\r\n\r\nStill, he could think. The man Rhamda had made an assertion that he\r\ncould not quite uncover. It puzzled him. Something told him that for the\r\nsafety of his old friend it might be well for him to shadow the strange\r\npair to the city.\r\n\r\nWhen the next train pulled out for the pier the two scholars were\r\nseated in the forward part of the car. In the last seat was a man deeply\r\nimmersed in a morning paper.\r\n\r\nIt is rather unfortunate. In the natural delicacy of the situation\r\nJerome could not crowd too closely. He had no certainty of trouble; no\r\nproof whatever; he was known to the professor. The best he could do was\r\nto keep aloof and follow their movements. At the ferry building they\r\nhailed a taxi and started up Market Street. Jerome watched them. In\r\nanother moment he had another driver and was winding behind in their\r\nwheel tracks. The cab made straight for Chatterton Place. In front of a\r\nsubstantial two-story house it drew up. The two men alighted. Jerome's\r\ntaxi passed them.\r\n\r\nThey were then at the head of the steps; a woman of slender beauty\r\nwith a wonderful loose fold of black hair was talking. It seemed to the\r\ndetective that her voice was fearful, of a pregnant warning, that she\r\nwas protesting. Nevertheless, the old men entered and the door slammed\r\nbehind them. Jerome slipped from the taxi and spoke a few words to\r\nthe driver. A moment later the two men were holding the house under\r\nsurveillance.\r\n\r\nThey did not have long to wait. The man called Rhamda had asked for\r\nfifteen minutes. At the stroke of the second the front door re-opened.\r\nSomeone was laughing; a melodious enchanting laugh and feminine. A woman\r\nwas speaking. And then there were two forms in the doorway. A man and\r\na woman. The man was Rhamda Avec, tall, immaculate, black clad and\r\ndistinguished. The woman, Jerome was not certain that she was the\r\nsame who opened the door or not; she was even more beautiful. She\r\nwas laughing. Like her companion she was clad in black, a beautiful\r\nshimmering material which sparkled in the sun like the rarest silk.\r\nThe man glanced carelessly up and down the street for a moment. Then he\r\nassisted the lady down the steps and into the taxi. The door slammed;\r\nand before the detective could gather his scattered wits they were lost\r\nin the city.\r\n\r\nJerome was expecting the professor. Naturally when the door opened he\r\nlooked for the old gentleman and his companion. It was the doctor he was\r\nwatching, not the other. Though he had no rational reason for expecting\r\ntrouble he had still his hunch and his intuition. The man and woman\r\naroused suspicion; and likewise upset his calculation. He could not\r\nfollow them and stay with the professor. It was a moment for quick\r\ndecision. He wondered. Where was Dr. Holcomb? This was the day he was to\r\ndeliver his lecture on the Blind Spot. He had read the announcement in\r\nthe paper on the way back, together with certain comments by the editor.\r\nIn the lecture itself there was mystery. This strange one, Rhamda,\r\nwas mixed in the Blind Spot. Undoubtedly he was the essential fact and\r\nsubstance. Until now he had not scented tragedy. Why had Rhamda and the\r\nwoman come out together? Where was the professor?\r\n\r\nWhere indeed?\r\n\r\nAt the end of a half-hour Jerome ventured across the street. He noted\r\nthe number 288. Then he ascended the steps and clanged at the knocker.\r\nFrom the sounds that came from inside, the place was but partly\r\nfurnished. Hollow steps sounded down the hallway, shuffling, like weary\r\nbones dragging slippers. The door opened and an old woman, very old,\r\npeered out of the crack. She coughed. Though it was not a loud cough\r\nit seemed to the detective that it would be her last one; there was so\r\nlittle of her.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, but is Dr. Holcomb here?”\r\n\r\nThe old lady looked up at him. The eyes were of blank expressionless\r\nblue; she was in her dotage.\r\n\r\n“You mean--oh, yes, I think so, the old man with the white whiskers. He\r\nwas here a few minutes ago, with that other. But he just went out, sir,\r\nhe just went out.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don't think so. There was a man went out and a woman. But not Dr.\r\nHolcomb.”\r\n\r\n“A woman? There was no woman.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, there was a woman--a very beautiful one.”\r\n\r\nThe old lady dropped her hand. It was trembling.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear,” she was saying. “This makes two. This morning it was a man\r\nand now it is a woman, that makes two.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the man as he looked down in her eyes that he was looking\r\ninto great fear; she was so slight and frail and helpless and so old;\r\nsuch a fragile thing to bear burden and trouble. Her voice was cracked\r\nand just above a shrill whisper, almost uncanny. She kept repeating:\r\n\r\n“Now there are two. Now there are two. That makes two. This morning\r\nthere was one. Now there are two.”\r\n\r\nJerome could not understand. He pitied the old lady.\r\n\r\n“Did you say that Dr. Holcomb is here?”\r\n\r\nAgain she looked up: the same blank expression, she was evidently trying\r\nto gather her wits.\r\n\r\n“Two. A woman. Dr. Holcomb. Oh, yes, Dr. Holcomb. Won't you come in?”\r\n\r\nShe opened the door.\r\n\r\nJerome entered and took off his hat. Judicially he repeated the doctor's\r\nname to keep it in her mind. She closed the door carefully and touched\r\nhis arm. It seemed to him that she was terribly weak and tottering; her\r\nold eyes, however expressionless, were full of pitiful pleading. She was\r\nscarcely more than a shadow.\r\n\r\n“You are his son?”\r\n\r\nJerome lied; but he did it for a reason. “Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then come.”\r\n\r\nShe took him by the sleeve and led him to a room, then across it to a\r\ndoor in the side wall. Her step was slow and feeble; twice she stopped\r\nto sing the dirge of her wonder. “First a man and then a woman. Now\r\nthere is one. You are his son.” And twice she stopped and listened. “Do\r\nyou hear anything? A bell? I love to hear it: and then afterward I am\r\nafraid. Did you ever notice a bell? It always makes you think of church\r\nand the things that are holy. This is a beautiful bell--first--”\r\n\r\nEither the woman was without her reason or very nearly so: she was very\r\nfrail.\r\n\r\n“Come, mother, I know, first a bell, but Dr. Holcomb?”\r\n\r\nThe name brought her back again. For a moment she was blank trying to\r\nrecall her senses. And then she remembered. She pointed to the door.\r\n\r\n“In there--Dr. Holcomb. That's where they come. That's where they\r\ngo. Dr. Holcomb. The little old man with the beautiful whiskers. This\r\nmorning it was a man; now it is a woman. Now there are two. Oh, dear;\r\nperhaps we shall hear the bell.”\r\n\r\nJerome began to scent a tragedy. Certainly the old lady was uncanny; the\r\nhouse was bare and hollow; the scant furniture was threadbare with\r\nage and mildew; each sound was exaggerated and fearful, even their\r\nbreathing. He placed his hand on the knob and opened the door.\r\n\r\n“Now there are two. Now there are two.”\r\n\r\nThe room was empty. Not a bit of furniture; a blank, bare apartment with\r\nan old-fashioned high ceiling. Nothing else. Whatever the weirdness and\r\nadventure, Jerome was getting nowhere. The old lady was still clinging\r\nto his arm and still droning:\r\n\r\n“Now there are two. Now there are two. This morning a man; now a woman.\r\nNow there are two.”\r\n\r\n“Come, mother, come. This will not do. Perhaps--”\r\n\r\nBut just then the old lady's lean fingers clinched into his arm; her\r\neyes grew bright; her mouth opened and she stopped in the middle of her\r\ndrone. Jerome grew rigid. And no wonder. From the middle of the room\r\nnot ten feet away came the tone of a bell, a great silvery voluminous\r\nsound--and music. A church bell. Just one stroke, full toned, filling\r\nall the air till the whole room was choked with music. Then as suddenly\r\nit died out and faded into nothing. At the same time he felt the fingers\r\non his arm relax; and a heap was at his feet. He reached over. The life\r\nand intelligence that was so near the line was just crossing over the\r\nborder. The poor old lady! Here was a tragedy he could not understand.\r\nHe stooped over to assist her. He was trembling. As he did so he heard\r\nthe drone of her soul as it wafted to the shadow:\r\n\r\n“Now there are two.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGONE\r\n\r\n\r\nJerome was a strong man, of iron nerve, and well set against emotion;\r\nin the run of his experience he had been plumped into many startling\r\nsituations; but none like this. The croon of the old lady thrummed in\r\nhis ears with endless repetition. He picked her up tenderly and bore her\r\nto another room and placed her on a ragged sofa. There were still marks\r\non her face of former beauty. He wondered who she was and what had been\r\nher life to come to such an ending.\r\n\r\n“Now there are two,” the words were withering with oppression.\r\nSubconsciously he felt the load that crushed her spirit. It was as if\r\nthe burden had been shifted; he sensed the weight of an unaccountable\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nThe place was musty and ill-lighted. He looked about him, the dank,\r\nclose air was unwashed by daylight. A stray ray of sunshine filtering\r\nthrough the broken shutter slanted across the room and sought vainly\r\nto dispel the shadow. He thought of Dr. Holcomb and the old lady.\r\n“Now there are two.” Was it a double tragedy? First of all he must\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nThe place was of eleven rooms, six downstairs and five on the upper\r\nstory. With the exception of one broken chair there was no furniture\r\nupstairs; four of the rooms on the lower floor were partly furnished,\r\ntwo not at all. A rear room had evidently been to the old lady the\r\nwhole of her habitation, serving as a kitchen, bedroom, and living-room\r\ncombined. Except in this room there were no carpets what-ever. His steps\r\nsounded hollow and ghostly; the boards creaked and each time he opened\r\na door he was oppressed by the same gloom of dankness and stagnation.\r\nThere was no trace of Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the bell and sought vainly on both floors for anything\r\nthat would give him a clue to the sound. There was nothing. The only\r\nthing he heard was the echoing of his own creaking footsteps and the\r\nunceasing tune that dinned in his spirit, “Now there are two.”\r\n\r\nAt last he came to the door and looked out into the street. The sun\r\nwas shining and the life and pulse was rising from the city. It was\r\ndaylight; plain, healthy day. It was good to look at. On the threshold\r\nof the door he felt himself standing on the border of two worlds. What\r\nhad become of the doctor and who was the old lady; and lastly and just\r\nas important, who was the Rhamda and his beautiful companion?\r\n\r\nJerome telephoned to headquarters.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange case.\r\n\r\nAt the precise minute when his would-be auditors were beginning to\r\nfidget over his absence, the police of San Francisco had started the\r\nsearch for the great doctor. Jerome had followed his intuition. It had\r\nled him into a tragedy and he was ready to swear almost on his soul\r\nthat it was twofold. The prominence of the professor, together with his\r\nstartling announcement of the day previous and the world-wide comment\r\nthat it had aroused, elevated the case to a national interest.\r\n\r\nWhat was the Blind Spot? The world conjectured, and like the world has\r\nbeen since beginning, it scoffed and derided. Some there were, however,\r\nmen well up in the latest discoveries of science, who did not laugh.\r\nThey counselled forbearance; they would wait for the doctor and his\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\nThere was no lecture. In the teeth of our expectation came the startling\r\nword that the doctor had disappeared. Apparently when on the very verge\r\nof announcing his discovery he had been swallowed by the very force that\r\nhe had loosened. There was nothing in known science outside of optics,\r\nthat could in any way be blended with the Blind Spot. There were but two\r\nsolutions; either the professor had been a victim of a clever rogue, or\r\nhe had been overcome by the rashness of his own wisdom. At any rate, it\r\nwas known from that minute on as “THE BLIND SPOT.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is just as well to take up the findings of the police. The\r\npolice of course never entertained any suggestion of the occult. They\r\nare material; and were convinced from the start that the case had its\r\norigin in downright villainy. Man is complex; but being so, is oft\r\noverbalanced by evil Some genius had made a fool of the doctor.\r\n\r\nIn the first place a thorough search was made for the professor. The\r\nhouse at No. 288 Chatterton Place was ransacked from cellar to attic.\r\nThe records were gone over and it was found that the property had for\r\nsome time been vacant; that the real ownership was vested in a number of\r\nheirs scattered about the country.\r\n\r\nThe old lady had apparently been living on the place simply through\r\nsufferance. No one could find out who she was. A few tradesman in the\r\nvicinity had sold her some scant supplies and that was all. The stress\r\nthat Jerome placed upon her actions and words was; given its due\r\naccount. There were undoubtedly two villains; but there were two\r\nvictims. That the old lady was such as well as the professor no one has\r\ndoubted. The whole secret lay in the gentleman with the Eastern cast and\r\ncomplexion. Who was Rhamda Avec?\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the strangest part of the story. Ever, when we re-count\r\nthe tale, there is something to overturn the theories of the police.\r\nIt has become a sort of legend in San Francisco; one to be taken with\r\na grain of salt, to be sure, but for all that, one at which we may well\r\nwonder. Here the supporters of the professor's philosophy hold their\r\nstrongest point--if it is true. Of course we can venture no private\r\nopinion, never having been a witness. It is this:\r\n\r\nRhamda Avec is with us and in our city. His description and drawn\r\nlikeness have been published many times. There are those who aver that\r\nthey have seen him in reality of the flesh walking through the crowds of\r\nMarket Street.\r\n\r\nHe is easily distinguished, tall and distinctive, refined to a high\r\ndegree, and with the poise and alertness of a gentleman of reliance and\r\ncharacter. Women look twice and wonder; he is neither old nor young;\r\nwhen he smiles it is like youth breaking in laughter. And with him often\r\nis his beautiful companion.\r\n\r\nMen vouch for her beauty and swear that it is of the kind that drives to\r\ndistraction. She is fire and flesh and carnal--she is more than beauty.\r\nThere is allurement about her body; sylph-like, sinuous; the olive\r\ntint of her complexion, the wonderful glory of her hair and the glowing\r\nnight-black of her eyes. Men pause; she is of the superlative kind that\r\nrobs the reason, a supreme glory of passion and life and beauty, at\r\nwhose feet fools and wise men would slavishly frolic and folly. She\r\nseldom speaks, but those who have heard her say that it is like rippling\r\nwater, of gentleness and softness and of the mellow flow that comes from\r\nlove and passion and from beauty.\r\n\r\nOf course there is nothing out of the ordinary in their walking down the\r\nstreets. Anybody might do that. The wonder comes in the manner in which\r\nthey elude the police. They come and go in the broad, bright daylight.\r\nHundreds have seen them. They make no effort at concealment, nor\r\ndisguise. And yet no phantoms were ever more unreal than they to those\r\nwho seek them. Who are they? The officers have been summoned on many\r\noccasions; but each and every time in some manner or way they had\r\ncontrived to elude them. There are some who have consigned them to the\r\nlimbo of illusion. But we do not entirely agree.\r\n\r\nIn a case like this it is well to take into consideration the\r\nrespectability and character of those who have witnessed. Phantoms are\r\nnot corporeal; these two are flesh and blood. There is mystery about\r\nthem; but they are substance, the same as we are.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly:\r\n\r\nIf you will take the Key Route ferry some foggy morning you may see\r\nsomething to convince you. It must be foggy and the air must be grey and\r\ndrab and sombre. Take the lower deck. Perhaps you will see nothing. If\r\nnot try again; for they say you shall be rewarded. Watch the forward\r\npart of the boat; but do not leave the inner deck. The great Rhamda\r\nwatching the grey swirl of the water!\r\n\r\nHe stands alone, in his hands the case of reddish leather, his feet\r\nslightly apart and his face full of a great hungry wonder. Watch his\r\nfeatures: they are strong and aglow with a great and wondrous wisdom;\r\nmark if you see evil. And remember. Though he is like you he is\r\nsomething vastly different. He is flesh and blood; but perhaps the\r\nmaster of one of the greatest laws that man can attain to. He is the\r\nfact and the substance that was promised, but was not delivered by the\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nThis account has been largely taken from one of the Sunday editions of\r\nour papers. I do not agree with it entirely. Nevertheless, it will serve\r\nas an excellent foundation for my own adventures; and what is best of\r\nall, save labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Harry Wendel.\r\n\r\nI am an attorney and until recently boasted of a splendid practice and\r\nan excellent prospect for the future. I am still a young man; I have\r\nhad a good education and still have friends and admirers. Such being the\r\ncase, you no doubt wonder why I give a past reference to my practice and\r\nwhat the future might have held for me. Listen:\r\n\r\nI might as well start 'way back. I shall do it completely and go back to\r\nthe fast-receding time of childhood.\r\n\r\nThere is a recollection of childish disaster. I had been making\r\nstrenuous efforts to pull the tail out of the cat that I might use\r\nit for a feather duster. My desire was supreme logic. I could not\r\nunderstand objection; the cat resisted for certain utilitarian reasons\r\nof its own and my mother through humane sympathy. I had been scratched\r\nand spanked in addition: it was the first storm centre that I remember.\r\nI had been punished but not subdued. At the first opportunity, I stole\r\nout of the house and onto the lawn that stretched out to the pavement.\r\n\r\nI remember the day. The sun was shining, the sky was clear, and\r\neverything was green with springtime. For a minute I stood still and\r\nblinked in the sunlight. It was beautiful and soft and balmy; the\r\nworld at full exuberance; the buds upon the trees, the flowers, and the\r\nsongbirds singing. I could not understand it. It was so beautiful and\r\nsoft. My heart was still beating fiercely, still black with perversity\r\nand stricken rancour. The world had no right to be so. I hated with the\r\nfull rush of childish anger.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw.\r\n\r\nAcross the street coming over to meet me was a child of my age. He was\r\nfat and chubby, a mass of yellow curls and laughter; when he walked he\r\nheld his feet out at angles as is the manner of fat boys and his arms\r\naway from his body. I slid off the porch quietly. Here was something\r\nthat could suffer for the cat and my mother. At my rush he stopped in\r\nwonder. I remember his smiling face and my anger. In an instant I had\r\nhim by the hair and was biting with all the fury of vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nAt first he set up a great bawl for assistance. He could not understand;\r\nhe screamed and held his hands aloft to keep them out of my reach. Then\r\nhe tried to run away. But I had learned from the cat that had scratched\r\nme. I clung on, biting, tearing. The shrill of his scream was music: it\r\nwas conflict, sweet and delicious; it was strife, swift as instinct.\r\n\r\nAt last I stopped him; he ceased trying to get away and began to\r\nstruggle. It was better still; it was resistance. But he was stronger\r\nthan I; though I was quicker he managed to get my by the shoulders,\r\nto force me back, and finally to upset me. Then in the stolid way, and\r\nafter the manner of fat boys, he sat upon my chest. When our startled\r\nmothers came upon the scene they so found us--I upon my back, clinching\r\nmy teeth and threatening all the dire fates of childhood, and he waiting\r\neither for assistance or until my ire should retire sufficiently to\r\nallow him to release me in safety.\r\n\r\n“Who did it? Who started it?”\r\n\r\nThat I remember plainly.\r\n\r\n“Hobart, did you do this?” The fat boy backed off quietly and clung to\r\nhis mother; but he did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Hobart, did you start this?”\r\n\r\nStill no answer.\r\n\r\n“Harry, this was you; you started it. Didn't you try to hurt Hobart?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\nMy mother took me by the hand and drew me away.\r\n\r\n“He is a rascal, Mrs. Fenton, and has a temper like sin; but he will\r\ntell the truth, thank goodness.”\r\n\r\nI am telling this not for the mere relation, but by way of introduction.\r\nIt was my first meeting with Hobart Fenton. It is necessary that you\r\nknow us both and our characters. Our lives are so entwined and so\r\nrelated that without it you could not get the gist of the story. In\r\nthe afternoon I came across the street to play with Hobart. He met me\r\nsmiling. It was not in his healthy little soul to hold resentment. I was\r\neither all smiles or anger. I forgot as quickly as I battled. That night\r\nthere were two happy youngsters tucked into the bed and covers.\r\n\r\nSo we grew up; one with the other. We played as children do and fought\r\nas boys have done from the beginning. I shall say right now that the\r\nfights were mostly my fault. I started them one and all; and if every\r\nbattle had the same beginning it likewise had the same ending. The first\r\nfight was but the forerunner of all the others.\r\n\r\nPlease do not think hardly of Hobart. He is the kindest soul in the\r\nworld; there never was a truer lad nor a kinder heart. He was strong,\r\nhealthy, fat, and, like fat boys, forever laughing. He followed me\r\ninto trouble and when I was retreating he valiantly defended the rear.\r\nStronger, sturdier, and slower, he has been a sort of protector from the\r\nbeginning. I have called him the Rear Guard; and he does not resent it.\r\n\r\nI have always been in mischief, restless, and eager for anything that\r\nwould bring quick action; and when I got into deep water Hobart would\r\ncome along, pluck me out and pull me to shore and safety. Did you ever\r\nsee a great mastiff and a fox terrier running together? It is a homely\r\nillustration; but an apt one.\r\n\r\nWe were boys together, with our delights and troubles, joys and sorrows.\r\nI thought so much of Hobart that I did not shirk stooping to help him\r\ntake care of his baby sister. That is about the supreme sacrifice of\r\na boy's devotion. In after years, of course, he has laughed at me and\r\nswears I did it on purpose. I do not know, but I am willing to admit\r\nthat I think a whole lot of that sister.\r\n\r\nSide by side we grew up and into manhood. We went to school and\r\ninto college. Even as we were at odds in our physical builds and our\r\ndispositions, so were we in our studies. From the beginning Hobart has\r\nhad a mania for screws, bolts, nuts, and pistons. He is practical; he\r\nlikes mathematics; he can talk to you from the binomial theorem up\r\ninto Calculus; he is never so happy as when the air is buzzing with\r\na conversation charged with induction coils, alternating currents,\r\nor atomic energy. The whole swing and force of popular science is his\r\nkingdom. I will say for Hobart that he is just about in line to be king\r\nof it all. Today he is in South America, one of our greatest engineers.\r\nHe is bringing the water down from the Andes; and it is just about like\r\nthose strong shoulders and that good head to restore the land of the\r\nIncas.\r\n\r\nAbout myself? I went into the law. I enjoy an atmosphere of strife and\r\ncontention. I liked books and discussion and I thought that I would like\r\nthe law. On the advice of my elders I entered law college, and in due\r\ntime was admitted to practice. It was while studying to qualify that\r\nI first ran into philosophy. I was a lad to enjoy quick, pithy,\r\nepigrammatic statements. I have always favoured a man who hits from the\r\nshoulder. Professor Holcomb was a man of terse, heavy thinking; he spoke\r\nwhat he thought and he did not quibble. He favoured no one.\r\n\r\nI must confess that the old white-haired professor left his stamp upon\r\nme. I loved him like all the rest; though I was not above playing a\r\ntrick on the old fellow occasionally. Still he had a wit of his own and\r\nseldom came out second best, and when he lost out he could laugh like\r\nthe next one. I was deeply impressed by him. As I took course after\r\ncourse under him I was convinced that for all of his dry philosophy the\r\nold fellow had a trick up his sleeve; he had a way of expounding that\r\nwas rather startling; likewise, he had a scarcely concealed contempt for\r\nsome of the demigods of our old philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhat this trick was I could never uncover. I hung on and dug into great\r\ntomes of wisdom. I became interested and gradually took up with his\r\nspeculation; for all my love of action I found that I had a strong\r\nsubcurrent for the philosophical.\r\n\r\nNow I roomed with Hobart. When I would come home with some dry tome and\r\nwould lose myself in it by the hour he could not understand it. I was\r\npreparing for the law. He could see no advantage to be derived from this\r\ndigging into speculation. He was practical and unless he could drive a\r\nnail into a thing or at least dig into its chemical elements it was hard\r\nto get him interested.\r\n\r\n“Of what use is it, Harry? Why waste your brains? These old fogies have\r\nbeen pounding on the question for three thousand years. What have they\r\ngot? You could read all their literature from the pyramids down to the\r\npresent sky-scrapers and you wouldn't get enough practical wisdom to\r\ndrive a dump-cart.”\r\n\r\n“That's just it,” I answered. “I'm not hankering for a dump-cart.\r\nYou have an idea that all the wisdom in the world is locked up in the\r\nconcrete; unless a thing has wheels, pistons, some sort of combustion,\r\nor a chemical action you are not interested. What gives you the control\r\nover your machinery? Brains! But what makes the mind go?”\r\n\r\nHobart blinked. “Fine,” he answered. “Go on.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I answered, “that's what I am after.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “Great. Well, keep at it. It's your funeral, Harry. When you\r\nhave found, it let me know and I'll beat you to the patent.”\r\n\r\nWith that he turned to his desk and dug into one of his everlasting\r\nformulas. Just the same, next day when I entered Holcomb's lecture-room\r\nI was in for a surprise. My husky room-mate was in the seat beside me.\r\n\r\n“What's the big idea?” I asked. “Big idea is right, Harry,” he grinned.\r\n“Just thought I would beat you to it. Had a dickens of a time with\r\nDan Clark, of the engineering department. Told him I wanted to study\r\nphilosophy. The old boy put up a beautiful holler. Couldn't understand\r\nwhat an engineer would want with psychology or ethics. Neither could I\r\nuntil I got to thinking last night when I went to roost. Because a thing\r\nhas never been done is no reason why it never will be; is it, Harry?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not. I don't know just what you are driving at. Perhaps you\r\nintend to take your notes over to the machine shop and hammer out the\r\nSecret of the Absolute.”\r\n\r\nHe grinned.\r\n\r\n“Pretty wise head at that, Harry. What did you call it? The Secret of\r\nthe Absolute. Will remember that. I'm not much on phrases; but I'm sure\r\nthe strong boy with the hammer. You don't object to my sitting here\r\nbeside you; so that I, too, may drink in the little drops of wisdom?”\r\n\r\nIt was in this way that Hobart entered into the study of philosophy.\r\nWhen the class was over and we were going down the steps he patted me on\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n“That's not so bad, Harry. Not so bad. The old doctor is there; he's got\r\nthem going. Likewise little Hobart has got a big idea.”\r\n\r\nNow it happened that this was just about six weeks before Dr. Holcomb\r\nannounced his great lecture on the Blind Spot. It was not more than a\r\nweek after registration. In the time ensuing Fenton became just as\r\ngreat an enthusiast as myself. His idea, of course, was chimerical and\r\na blind; his main purpose was to get in with me where he could argue me\r\nout of my folly.\r\n\r\nHe wound up by being a convert of the professor.\r\n\r\nThen came the great day. The night of the announcement we had a long\r\ndiscussion. It was a deep question. For all of my faith in the professor\r\nI was hardly prepared for a thing like this. Strange to say I was the\r\nsceptic; and stranger still, it was Hobart who took the side of the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he said. “It merely comes down to this: you grant that a\r\nthing is possible and then you deny the possibility of a proof--outside\r\nof your abstract. That's good paradox, Harry; but almighty poor logic.\r\nIf it is so it certainly can be proven. There's not one reason in the\r\nworld why we can't have something concrete. The professor is right. I am\r\nwith him. He's the only professor in all the ages.”\r\n\r\nWell, it turned out as it did. It was a terrible blow to us all. Most\r\nof the world took it as a great murder or an equally great case of\r\nabduction. There were but few, even in the university, who embraced the\r\nside of the doctor. It was a case of villainy, of a couple of remarkably\r\nclever rogues and a trusting scholar.\r\n\r\nBut there was one whose faith was not diminished. He had been one of\r\nthe last to come under the influence of the doctor. He was practical and\r\nconcrete, and not at all attuned to philosophy; he had not the training\r\nfor deep dry thinking. He would not recede one whit. One day I caught\r\nhim sitting down with his head between his hands. I touched him on the\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“What's the deep study?” I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe looked up. By his eyes I could see that his thoughts had been far\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“What's the deep study?” I repeated.\r\n\r\n“I was just thinking, Harry; just thinking.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I was just thinking, Harry, that I would like to have about one hundred\r\nthousand dollars and about ten years' leisure.”\r\n\r\n“That's a nice thought,” I answered; “I could think that myself. What\r\nwould you do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Do? Why, there is just one thing that I would do if I had that much\r\nmoney. I would solve the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\nThis happened years ago while we were still in college. Many things have\r\noccurred since then. I am writing this on the verge of disaster. How\r\nlittle do we know! What was the idea that buzzed in the head of Hobart\r\nFenton? He is concrete, physical, fearless. He is in South America. I\r\nhave cabled to him and expect him as fast as steam can bring him. The\r\ngreat idea and discovery of the professor is a fact, not fiction. What\r\nis it? That I cannot answer. I have found it and I am a witness to its\r\npotency.\r\n\r\nSome law has been missed through the ages. It is inexorable and\r\ninsidious; it is concrete. Out of the unknown comes terror. Through the\r\nlove for the great professor I have pitted myself against it. From the\r\nbeginning it has been almost hopeless. I remember that last digression\r\nin ethics. “The mystery of the occult may be solved. We are five-sensed.\r\nWhen we bring the thing down to the concrete we may understand.”\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder at the Rhamda. Is he a man or a phantom? Does he\r\ncontrol the Blind Spot? Is he the substance and the proof that was\r\npromised by Dr. Holcomb? Through what process and what laws did the\r\nprofessor acquire even his partial control over the phenomena? Where\r\ndid the Rhamda and his beautiful companion come from? Who are they? And\r\nlastly--what was the idea that buzzed in the head of Hobart Fenton?\r\n\r\nWhen I look back now I wonder. I have never believed in fate. I do not\r\nbelieve in it now. Man is the master of his own destiny. We are cowards\r\nelse. Whatever is to be known we should know it. One's duty is ever to\r\none's fellows. Heads up and onward. I am not a brave man, perhaps, under\r\nclose analysis; but once I have given my word I shall keep it. I have\r\ndone my bit; my simple duty. Perhaps I have failed. In holding myself\r\nagainst the Blind Spot I have done no more than would have been done by\r\na million others. I have only one regret. Failure is seldom rewarded. I\r\nhad hoped that my life would be the last; I have a dim hope still. If I\r\nfail in the end, there must be still one more to follow.\r\n\r\nUnderstand I do not expect to die. It is the unknown that I am afraid\r\nof. I who thought that we knew so much have found it still so little.\r\nThere are so many laws in the weave of Cosmos that are still unguessed.\r\nWhat is this death that we are afraid of? What is life? Can we solve it?\r\nIs it permissible? What is the Blind Spot? If Hobart Fenton is right it\r\nhas nothing to do with death. If so, what is it?\r\n\r\nMy pen is weak. I am weary. I am waiting for Hobart. Perhaps I shall not\r\nlast. When he comes I want him to know my story. What he knows already\r\nwill not hurt repeating. It is well that man shall have it; it may be\r\nthat we shall both fail-there is no telling; but if we do the world can\r\nprofit by our blunders and guide itself--perhaps to the mastery of the\r\nphenomenon that controls the Blind Spot.\r\n\r\nI ask you to bear with me. If I make a few mistakes or I am a bit loose,\r\nremember the stress under which I am writing. I shall try to be plain so\r\nthat all may follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nCHICK WATSON\r\n\r\n\r\nNow to go back.\r\n\r\nIn due time we were both of us graduated from college. I went into the\r\nlaw and Hobart into engineering. We were both successful. There was\r\nnot a thing to foreshadow that either of us was to be jerked from his\r\nprofession. There was no adventure, but lots of work and reward in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was a bit more fortunate. I was in love and Hobart was still\r\na confirmed bachelor. It was a subject over which he was never done\r\njoking. It was not my fault. I was innocent. If the blame ran anywhere\r\nit would have to be placed upon that baby sister of his.\r\n\r\nIt happened as it happened since God first made the maiden. One autumn\r\nHobart and I started off for college. We left Charlotte at the gate a\r\ngirl of fifteen years and ten times as many angles. I pulled one of her\r\npigtails, kissed her, and told her I wanted her to get pretty. When we\r\ncame home next summer I went over to pull the other pigtail. I did not\r\npull it. I was met by the fairest young woman I had ever looked on. And\r\nI could not kiss her. Seriously, was I to blame?\r\n\r\nNow to the incident.\r\n\r\nIt was a night in September. Hobart had completed his affairs and had\r\nbooked passage to South America. He was to sail next morning. We had\r\ndinner that day with his family, and then came up to San Francisco for\r\na last and farewell bachelor night. We could take in the opera together,\r\nhave supper at our favourite cafe, and then turn in. It was a long hark\r\nback to our childhood; but for all that we were still boys together.\r\n\r\nI remember that night. It was our favourite opera--“Faust.” It was the\r\none piece that we could agree on. Looking back since, I have wondered at\r\nthe coincidence. The old myth of age to youth and the subcurrent of sin\r\nwith its stalking, laughing, subtle Mephistopheles. It is strange that\r\nwe should have gone to this one opera on this one evening. I recall\r\nour coming out of the theatre; our minds thrilling to the music and the\r\nsubtle weirdness of the theme.\r\n\r\nA fog had fallen--one of those thick, heavy, grey mists that sometimes\r\ncome upon us in September. Into its sombre depths the crowd disappeared\r\nlike shadows. The lights upon the streets blurred yellow. At the cold\r\nsheer contact we hesitated upon the pavement.\r\n\r\nI had on a light overcoat. Hobart, bound for the tropics, had no such\r\nprotection. It was cold and miserable, a chill wind stirring from the\r\nnorth was unusually cutting. Hobart raised his collar and dug his hands\r\ninto his pockets.\r\n\r\n“Brr,” he muttered; “brr, some coffee or some wine. Something.”\r\n\r\nThe sidewalks were wet and slippery, the mists settling under the lights\r\nhad the effect of drizzle. I touched Hobart's arm and we started across\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n“Brr is right,” I answered, “and some wine. Notice the shadows, like\r\nghosts.”\r\n\r\nWe were half across the street before he answered; then he stopped.\r\n\r\n“Ghosts! Did you say ghosts, Harry?” I noted a strange inflection in his\r\nvoice. He stood still and peered into the fog bank. His stop was sudden\r\nand suggestive. Just then a passing taxicab almost caught us and we\r\nwere compelled to dodge quickly. Hobart ducked out of the way and I\r\nside-stepped in another direction. We came up on the sidewalk. Again he\r\npeered into the shadow.\r\n\r\n“Confound that cab,” he was saying, “now we have gone and missed him.”\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat and then put it back on his head. His favourite\r\ntrick when bewildered. I looked up and down the street.\r\n\r\n“Didn't you see him? Harry! Didn't you see him? It was Rhamda Avec!”\r\n\r\nI had seen no one; that is to notice; I did not know the Rhamda. Neither\r\ndid he.\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda? You don't know him.”\r\n\r\nHobart was puzzled.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said; “I do not; but it was he, just as sure as I am a fat\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nI whistled. I recalled the tale that was now a legend. The man had an\r\naffinity for the fog mist. To come out of “Faust” and to run into the\r\nRhamda! What was the connection? For a moment we both stood still and\r\nwaited.\r\n\r\n“I wonder--” said Hobart. “I was just thinking about that fellow\r\ntonight. Strange! Well, let's get something hot--some coffee.”\r\n\r\nBut it had given us something for discussion. Certainly it was unusual.\r\nDuring the past few days I had been thinking of Dr. Holcomb; and for the\r\nlast few hours the tale had clung with reiterating persistence. Perhaps\r\nit was the weirdness and the tremulous intoxication of the music. I was\r\none of the vast majority who disbelieved it. Was it possible that it\r\nwas, after all, other than the film of fancy? There are times when we\r\nare receptive; at that moment I could have believed it.\r\n\r\nWe entered the cafe and chose a table slightly to the rear. It was\r\na contrast to the cold outside; the lights so bright, the glasses\r\nclinking, laughter and music. A few young people were dancing. I sat\r\ndown; in a moment the lightness and jollity had stirred my blood. Hobart\r\ntook a chair opposite. The place was full of beauty. In the back of my\r\nmind blurred the image of Rhamda. I had never seen him; but I had read\r\nthe description. I wondered absently at the persistence.\r\n\r\nI have said that I do not believe in fate. I repeat it. Man should\r\ncontrol his own destiny. A great man does. Perhaps that is it. I am not\r\ngreat. Certainly it was circumstance.\r\n\r\nIn the back part of the room at one of the tables was a young man\r\nsitting alone. Something caught my attention. Perhaps it was his\r\nlistlessness or the dreamy unconcern with which he watched the dancers;\r\nor it may have been the utter forlornness of his expression. I noted his\r\nunusual pallor and his cast of dissipation, also the continual working\r\nof his long, lean fingers. There are certain set fixtures in the night\r\nlife of any city. But this was not one. He was not an habitue. There was\r\na certain greatness to his loneliness and his isolation. I wondered.\r\n\r\nJust then he looked up. By a mere coincidence our eyes met. He smiled,\r\na weak smile and a forlorn one, and it seemed to me rather pitiful. Then\r\nas suddenly his glance wandered to the door behind me. Perhaps there\r\nwas something in my expression that caught Hobart's attention. He turned\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n“Say, Harry, who is that fellow? I know that face, I'm certain.”\r\n\r\n“Come to think I have seen him myself. I wonder--”\r\n\r\nThe young man looked up again. The same weary smile. He nodded. And\r\nagain he glanced over my shoulder toward the door. His face suddenly\r\nhardened.\r\n\r\n“He knows us at any rate,” I ventured.\r\n\r\nNow Hobart was sitting with his face toward the entrance. He could see\r\nanyone coming or going. Following the young man's glance he looked over\r\nmy shoulder. He suddenly reached over and took me by the forearm.\r\n\r\n“Don't look round,” he warned; “take it easy. As I said--on my honour as\r\na fat man.”\r\n\r\nThe very words foretold. I could not but risk a glance. Across the room\r\na man was coming down the aisle--a tall man, dark, and of a very decided\r\nmanner. I had read his description many times; I had seen his likeness\r\ndrawn by certain sketch artists of the city. They did not do him\r\njustice. He had a wonderful way and presence--you might say, magnetism.\r\nI noticed the furtive wondering glances that were cast, especially by\r\nthe women. He was a handsome man beyond denying, about the handsomest I\r\nhad ever seen. The same elusiveness.\r\n\r\nAt first I would have sworn him to be near sixty; the next minute I was\r\njust as certain of his youth. There was something about him that could\r\nnot be put to paper, be it strength, force or vitality; he was subtle.\r\nHis step was prim and distinctive, light as shadow, in one hand\r\nhe carried the red case that was so often mentioned. I breathed an\r\nexclamation.\r\n\r\nHobart nodded.\r\n\r\n“Am I a fat man? The famous Rhamda! What say! Ah, ha! He has business\r\nwith our wan friend yonder. See!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was so. He took a chair opposite the wan one. The young man\r\nstraightened. His face was even more familiar, but I could not place\r\nhim. His lips were set; in their grim line--determination; whatever his\r\nexhaustion there was still a will. Somehow one had a respect for this\r\nweak one; he was not a mere weakling. Yet I was not so sure that he\r\nwas not afraid of the Rhamda. He spoke to the waiter. The Rhamda began\r\ntalking. I noted the poise in his manner; it was not evil, rather was it\r\ncalm--and calculating. He made an indication. The young man drew back.\r\nHe smiled; it was feeble and weary, but for all of that disdainful.\r\nThough one had a pity for his forlornness, there was still an\r\nadmiration. The waiter brought glasses.\r\n\r\nThe young man swallowed his drink at a gulp, the other picked his up and\r\nsipped it. Again he made the indication. The youth dropped his hand upon\r\nthe table, a pale blue light followed the movement of his fingers. The\r\nolder man pointed. So that was their contention? A jewel? After all our\r\nphantom was material enough to desire possession; his solicitude was\r\ncalmness, but for all that aggression. I could sense a battle, but the\r\nyoung man turned the jewel to the palm side of his fingers; he shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda drew up. For a moment he waited. Was it for surrender? Once\r\nhe started to speak, but was cut short by the other. For all of his\r\nweakness there was spirit to the young man. He even laughed. The Rhamda\r\ndrew out a watch. He held up two fingers. I heard Hobart mumble.\r\n\r\n“Two minutes. Well, I'm betting on the young one. Too much soul. He's\r\nnot dead; just weary.”\r\n\r\nHe was right. At exactly one hundred and twenty seconds the Rhamda\r\nclosed his watch. He spoke something. Again the young man laughed.\r\nHe lit a cigarette; from the flicker and jerk of the flame he was\r\ntrembling. But he was still emphatic. The other rose from the table,\r\nwalked down the aisle and out of the building. The youth spread out both\r\narms and dropped his head upon the table.\r\n\r\nIt was a little drama enacted almost in silence. Hobart and I exchanged\r\nglances. The mere glimpse of the Rhamda had brought us both back to the\r\nBlind Spot. Was there any connection? Who was the young man with the\r\nlife sapped out? I had a recollection of a face strangely familiar.\r\nHobart interrupted my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“I'd give just about one leg for the gist of that conversation. That was\r\nthe Rhamda; but who is the other ghost?”\r\n\r\n“Do you think it has to do with the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“I don't think,” averred Hobart. “I know. Wonder what's the time.” He\r\nglanced at his watch. “Eleven thirty.”\r\n\r\nJust here the young man at the table raised up his head. The cigarette\r\nwas still between his fingers; he puffed lamely for a minute, taking a\r\ndull note of his surroundings. In the well of gaiety and laughter coming\r\nfrom all parts of the room his actions were out of place. He seemed\r\ndazed; unable to pull himself together. Suddenly he looked at us. He\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n“He certainly knows us,” I said. “I wonder--by George, he's coming\r\nover.”\r\n\r\nEven his step was feeble. There was exertion about every move of his\r\nbody, the wanness and effort of vanished vitality; he balanced himself\r\ncarefully. Slowly, slowly, line by line his features became familiar,\r\nthe underlines of another, the ghost of one departed. At first I could\r\nnot place him. He held himself up for breath. Who was he? Then it\r\nsuddenly came to me--back to the old days at college--an athlete, one of\r\nthe best of fellows, one of the sturdiest of men! He had come to this!\r\n\r\nHobart was before me.\r\n\r\n“By all the things that are holy!” he exclaimed. “Chick Watson! Here,\r\nhave a seat. In the name of Heavens, Chick! What on earth--”\r\n\r\nThe other dropped feebly into the chair. The body that had once been so\r\npowerful was a skeleton. His coat was a disguise of padding.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Hobart; hello, Harry,” he spoke in a whisper. “Not much like the\r\nold Chick, am I? First thing, I'll take some brandy.”\r\n\r\nIt was almost tragic. I glanced at Hobart and nodded to the waiter.\r\nCould it be Chick Watson? I had seen him a year before, hale, healthy,\r\nprosperous. And here he was--a wreck!\r\n\r\n“No,” he muttered, “I'm not sick--not sick. Lord, boys, it's good to\r\nmeet you. I just thought I would come out for this one last night, hear\r\nsome music, see a pretty face, perhaps meet a friend. But I am afraid--”\r\n He dropped off like one suddenly drifting into slumber.\r\n\r\n“Hustle that waiter,” I said to Hobart. “Hurry that brandy.”\r\n\r\nThe stimulant seemed to revive him. He lifted up suddenly. There was\r\nfear in his eyes; then on seeing himself among friends--relief. He\r\nturned to me.\r\n\r\n“Think I'm sick, don't you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“You certainly are,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm not.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment silence. I glanced at Hobart. Hobart nodded.\r\n\r\n“You're just about in line for a doctor, Chick, old boy,” I said. “I'm\r\ngoing to see that you have one. Bed for you, and the care of mother--”\r\n\r\nHe started; he seemed to jerk himself together.\r\n\r\n“That's it, Harry; that's what I wanted. It's so hard for me to think.\r\nMother, mother! That's why I came downtown. I wanted a friend. I have\r\nsomething for you to give to mother.”\r\n\r\n“Rats,” I said. “I'll take you to her. What are you talking about?”\r\n\r\nBut he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I wish that you were telling the truth, Harry. But it's no use--not\r\nafter tonight. All the doctors in the world could not save me. I'm not\r\nsick, boys, far from it.”\r\n\r\nHobart spoke up.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Chick? I have a suspicion. Am I right?”\r\n\r\nChick looked up; he closed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“All right, Hobart, what's your suspicion?”\r\n\r\nFenton leaned over. It seemed to me that he was peering into the other's\r\nsoul. He touched his forearm.\r\n\r\n“Chick, old boy, I think I know. But tell me. Am I right? It's the Blind\r\nSpot.”\r\n\r\nAt the words Watson opened his eyes; they were full of hope and wonder,\r\nfor a moment, and then, as suddenly of a great despair. His body went to\r\na heap. His voice was feeble.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “I am dying--of the Blind Spot”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE RING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible thing; death stalking out of the Blind Spot. We had\r\nalmost forgotten. It had been a story hitherto--a wonderful one to be\r\nsure, and one to arouse conjecture. I had never thought that we were to\r\nbe brought to its shivering contact. It was out of the occult; it had\r\nbeen so pronounced by the professor; a great secret of life holding out\r\na guerdon of death to its votaries. Witness Chick Watson, the type of\r\nhealthy, fighting manhood--come to this. He opened his eyes feebly; one\r\ncould see the light; the old spirit was there--fighting for life. What\r\nwas this struggle of soul and flesh? Why had the soul hung on? He made\r\nanother effort.\r\n\r\n“More drink,” he asked; “more drink. Anything to hold me together. I\r\nmust tell you. You must take my place and--and--fight the Blind Spot!\r\nPromise that--”\r\n\r\n“Order the drinks,” I told Hobart. “I see Dr. Hansen over there. Even if\r\nwe cannot save him we must hold him until we get his story.”\r\n\r\nI went and fetched Hansen over.\r\n\r\n“A strange case,” he murmured. “Pulse normal; not a trace of fever. Not\r\nsick, you say--” Hobart pointed to his head. “Ah, I see! I would suggest\r\nhome and a bed.”\r\n\r\nJust here Watson opened his eyes again. They rested first upon the\r\ndoctor, then upon myself, and finally upon the brandy. He took it up and\r\ndrank it with eagerness. It was his third one; it gave him a bit more\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“Didn't I tell you, boys, that there is not a doctor on earth that\r\ncan save me? Excuse me, doc. I am not sick. I told them. I am far past\r\nphysic; I have gone beyond medicine. All I ask is stimulant and life\r\nenough to tell my story.”\r\n\r\n“My boy,” asked the doctor kindly, “what ails you?”\r\n\r\nWatson smiled. He touched himself on the forehead.\r\n\r\n“Up here, doc. There are things in the world with which we may not\r\ntamper. I tried it. Somebody had to do it and somebody has to do it yet.\r\nYou remember Dr. Holcomb; he was a great man; he was after the secret of\r\nlife. He began it.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hansen started.\r\n\r\n“Lord!” he exclaimed, looking at us all; “you don't mean this man is\r\nmixed up in the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\nWe nodded. Watson smiled; again he dropped back into inertia; the speech\r\nhe had made was his longest yet; the brandy was coming into effect.\r\n\r\n“Give him brandy,” the doctor said; “it's as good as anything. It will\r\nhold him together and give him life for a while. Here.” He reached into\r\nhis pocket and flicked something into the glass. “That will help him.\r\nGentlemen, do you know what it means? I had always thought! I knew Dr.\r\nHolcomb! Crossing over the border! It may not be done! The secret of\r\nlife is impossible. Yet--”\r\n\r\nWatson opened his eyes again; his spirit seemed suddenly to flicker into\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\n“Who said it was impossible? Who said it? Gentlemen, it IS possible. Dr.\r\nHolcomb--pardon me. I do not wish to appear a sot; but this brandy is\r\nabout the only thing to hold me together. I have only a few hours left.”\r\n\r\nHe took the glass, and at one gulp downed the contents. I do not know\r\nwhat the doctor had dropped into it. Chick revived suddenly, and a\r\nstrange light blazed up in his eyes, like life rekindled.\r\n\r\n“Ah, now I am better. So?”\r\n\r\nHe turned to us all; then to the doctor.\r\n\r\n“So you say the secret of life is impossible?”\r\n\r\n“I--”\r\n\r\nChick smiled wanly. “May I ask you: what it is that has just flared up\r\nwithin me? I am weak, anaemic, fallen to pieces; my muscles have lost\r\nthe power to function, my blood runs cold, I have been more than two\r\nfeet over the border. And yet--a few drinks of brandy, of stimulants,\r\nand you have drawn me back, my heart beats strongly, for an hour. By\r\nmeans of drugs you have infused a new life--which of course is the\r\nold--and driven the material components of my body into correlation. You\r\nare successful for a time; so long as nature is with you; but all the\r\nwhile you are held aghast by the knowledge that the least flaw, the\r\nleast disarrangement, and you are beaten.\r\n\r\n“It is your business to hold this life or what you may. When it has\r\ngone your structures, your anatomy, your wonderful human machine is\r\nworthless. Where has it come from? Where has it gone? I have drunk four\r\nglasses of brandy; I have a lease of four short hours. Ordinarily it\r\nwould bring reaction; it is poison, to be sure; but it is driving back\r\nmy spirit, giving me life and strength enough to tell my story--in the\r\nmorning I shall be no more. By sequence I am a dead man already. Four\r\nglasses of brandy; they are speaking. Whence comes this affinity of\r\nsubstance and of shadow?”\r\n\r\nWe all of us listened, the doctor most of all. “Go on,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Can't you see?” repeated Watson. “There is affinity between substance\r\nand shadow; and therefore your spirit or shadow or what you will is\r\nconcrete, is in itself a substance. It is material just as much as you\r\nare. Because you do not see it is no proof that it is not substance.\r\nThat pot palm yonder does not see you; it is not blessed with eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at Watson; he spoke gently.\r\n\r\n“This is very old stuff, my boy, out of your abstract philosophy. No man\r\nknows the secret of life. Not even yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe light in Watson's eyes grew brighter, he straightened; he began\r\nslipping the ring from his finger.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered. “I don't. I have tried and it was like playing with\r\nlightning. I sought for life and it is giving me death. But there is one\r\nman living who has found it.”\r\n\r\n“And this man?”\r\n\r\n“Is Dr. Holcomb!”\r\n\r\nWe all of us started. We had every one given the doctor up as dead. The\r\nvery presence of Watson was tragedy. We did not doubt that he had been\r\nthrough some terrible experience. There are things in the world that may\r\nnot be unriddled. Some power, some sinister thing was reaching for his\r\nvitality. What did he know about the professor? Dr. Holcomb had been a\r\nlong time dead.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen. You must hear my story; I haven't long to tell it. However,\r\nbefore I start here is a proof for a beginning.”\r\n\r\nHe tossed the ring upon the table.\r\n\r\nIt was Hobart who picked it up. A beautiful stone, like a sapphire; blue\r\nbut uncut and of a strange pellucid transparency--a jewel undoubtedly;\r\nbut of a kind we have never seen. We all of us examined it, and were\r\nall, I am afraid, a bit disappointed. It was a stone and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWatson watched us. The waiter had brought more brandy, and Watson was\r\nsipping it, not because he liked it, he said, but just to keep himself\r\nat the proper lift.\r\n\r\n“You don't understand it, eh? You see nothing? Hobart, have you a match?\r\nThere, that's it; now give me the ring. See--” He struck the match and\r\nheld the flame against the jewel. “Gentlemen, there is no need for me\r\nto speak. The stone will give you a volume. It's not trickery, I assure\r\nyou, but fact. There, now, perfect. Doctor, you are the sceptic. Take a\r\nlook at the stone.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor picked it up casually and held it up before his eyes. At\r\nfirst he frowned; then came a look of incredulity; his chin dropped and\r\nhe rose in his chair.\r\n\r\n“My God,” he exclaimed, “the man's living! It--he--”\r\n\r\nBut Hobart and I had crowded over. The doctor held the ring so we could\r\nsee it. Inside the stone was Dr. Holcomb!\r\n\r\nIt was a strenuous moment, and the most incredible. We all of us\r\nknew the doctor. It was not a photograph, nor a likeness; but the man\r\nhimself. It was beyond all reason that he could be in the jewel; indeed\r\nthere was only the head visible; one could catch the expression of life,\r\nthe movements of the eyelids. Yet how could it be? What was it? It was\r\nHobart who spoke first.\r\n\r\n“Chick,” he asked, “what's the meaning? Were it not for my own eyes I\r\nwould call it impossible. It's absurd on the face. The doctor! Yet I can\r\nsee him--living. Where is he?”\r\n\r\nChick nodded.\r\n\r\n“That's the whole question. Where is he? I know and yet I know nothing.\r\nYou are now looking into the Blind Spot. The doctor sought the secret of\r\nlife--and found it. He was trapped by his own wisdom!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE NERVINA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment we were silent. The jewel reposed upon the table. What was\r\nthe secret of its phenomena? I could think of nothing in science that\r\nwould explain it. How had Watson come into its possession? What was the\r\ntale he had to tell? The lean, long finger that clutched for brandy!\r\nWhat force was this that had driven him to such a verge? He was\r\nresigned; though he was defiant he had already conceded his surrender.\r\nDr. Hansen spoke.\r\n\r\n“Watson,” he asked, “what do you know about the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\nWe all turned to Chick. Hobart ordered more brandy. The doctor's eyes\r\nwent to slits. I could not but wonder.\r\n\r\n“Chick,” I asked, “who is Rhamda Avec?”\r\n\r\nWatson turned.\r\n\r\n“You saw him a few minutes ago? You saw him with me? Let me ask you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “I saw him. Most people did. Is he invisible? Is he\r\nreally the phantom they say?”\r\n\r\nSomehow the mention of the name made him nervous; he looked cautiously\r\nabout the room.\r\n\r\n“That I don't know, Harry. It--If I can only get my wits together. Is he\r\na phantom? Yes, I think so. I can't understand him. At least, he has the\r\npowers we attribute to an apparition. He is strange and unaccountable.\r\nSometimes you see him, sometimes you don't. The first known of him was\r\non the day Professor Holcomb was to deliver his lecture on the Blind\r\nSpot. He was tracked, you know, to the very act. Then came in the\r\nNervina.”\r\n\r\n“And who is the Nervina?”\r\n\r\nWatson looked at me blankly.\r\n\r\n“The Nervina?” he asked, “The Nervina--what do you know about the\r\nNervina?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. You mentioned her just now.”\r\n\r\nHis mind seemed to ramble. He looked about the room rather fearfully.\r\nPerhaps he was afraid.\r\n\r\n“Did I mention her? I don't know, Harry, my wits are muddled. The\r\nNervina? She is a goddess. Never was and never will be woman. She loves;\r\nshe never hates, and still again she does not love. She is beautiful;\r\ntoo beautiful for man. I've quit trying.”\r\n\r\n“Is she Rhamda's wife?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes lit fire.\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“Do you love her?”\r\n\r\nHe went blank again; but at last he spoke slowly.\r\n\r\n“No, I don't love her. What's the use? She's not for me. I did; but I\r\nlearned better. I was after the professor--and the Blind Spot. She--”\r\n\r\nAgain that look of haunted pursuit. He glanced about the room. Whatever\r\nhad been his experience, it was plain that he had not given up. He held\r\nsomething and he held it still. What was it?\r\n\r\n“You say you didn't find the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“No, I did not find it.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any idea?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Harry,” he answered, “I am full of ideas. That's the trouble.\r\nI am near it. It's the cause of my present condition. I don't know just\r\nwhat it is nor where. A condition, or a combination of phenomena. You\r\nremember the lecture that was never delivered? Had the doctor spoken\r\nthat morning the world would have had a great fact. He had made a great\r\ndiscovery. It is a terrible thing.” He turned the ring so we could all\r\nsee it--beyond all doubt it was the doctor. “There he is--the professor.\r\nIf he could only speak. The secret of the ages. Just think what it\r\nmeans. Where is he? I have taken that jewel to the greatest lapidaries\r\nand they have one and all been startled. Then they all come to the same\r\nconclusion--trickery--Chinese or Hindu work, they say; most of them want\r\nto cut.”\r\n\r\n“Have you taken it to the police?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I would simply be laughed at.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever reported this Rhamda?”\r\n\r\n“A score of times. They have come and sought; but every time he has gone\r\nout--like a shadow. It's got to be an old story now. If you call them up\r\nand tell them they laugh.”\r\n\r\n“How do you account for it?”\r\n\r\n“I don't. I--I--I'm just dying.”\r\n\r\n“And not one member of the force--surely?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. There's one. You have heard of Jerome. Jerome followed the\r\nprofessor and the Rhamda to the house of the Blind Spot, as he calls it.\r\nHe's not a man to fool. He had eyes and he saw it. He will not leave it\r\ntill he's dead.”\r\n\r\n“But he did not see the Blind Spot, did he? How about trickery? Did it\r\never occur to you that the professor might have been murdered?”\r\n\r\n“Take a look at that, Harry. Does that look like murder? When you see\r\nthe man living?”\r\n\r\nWatson reached over and turned up the jewel.\r\n\r\nHere Hobart came in.\r\n\r\n“Just a minute, Chick. My wise friend here is an attorney. He's always\r\nthe first into everything, especially conversation. It's been my job\r\npulling Harry out of trouble. Just one question.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“Didn't you--er--keep company, as they say, with Bertha Holcomb while at\r\ncollege?”\r\n\r\nA kind look came into the man's eyes; he nodded; his whole face was soft\r\nand saddened.\r\n\r\n“I see. That naturally brought you to the Blind Spot. You are after her\r\nfather. Am I correct?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly.”\r\n\r\n“All right. Perhaps Bertha has taken you into some of her father's\r\nsecrets. He undoubtedly had data on this Blind Spot. Have you ever been\r\nable to locate it?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“I see. This Rhamda? Has he ever sought that data?”\r\n\r\n“Many, many times.”\r\n\r\n“Does he know you haven't got it?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“So. I understand. You hold the whip hand through your ignorance. Rhamda\r\nis your villain--and perhaps this Nervina? Who is she?”\r\n\r\n“A goddess.”\r\n\r\nHobart smiled.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” He laughed. “A goddess. Naturally! They all are. There are\r\nabout forty in this room at the present moment, my dear fellow. Watch\r\nthem dance!”\r\n\r\nNow I had picked up the ring. It just fitted the natural finger. I tried\r\nit on and looked into the jewel. The professor was growing dimmer. The\r\nmarvellous blue was returning, a hue of fascination; not the hot flash\r\nof the diamond, but the frozen light of the iceberg. It was frigid,\r\ncold, terrible, blue, alluring. To me at the moment it seemed alive and\r\npulselike. I could not account for it. I felt the lust for possession.\r\nPerhaps there was something in my face. Watson leaned over and touched\r\nme on the arm.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” he asked, “do you think you can stand up under the burden? Will\r\nyou take my place?”\r\n\r\nI looked into his eyes; in their black depths was almost entreaty. How\r\nhaunting they were, and beseeching.\r\n\r\n“Will you take my place?” he begged. “Are you willing to give up all\r\nthat God gives to the fortunate? Will you give up your practice? Will\r\nyou hold out to the end? Never surrender? Will--”\r\n\r\n“You mean will I take this ring?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. But you must know beforehand. It would be murder to give it to\r\nyou without the warning. Either your death or that of Dr. Holcomb. It is\r\nnot a simple jewel. It defies description. It takes a man to wear it.\r\nIt is subtle and of destruction; it eats like a canker; it destroys the\r\nbody; it frightens the soul--”\r\n\r\n“An ominous piece of finery,” I spoke. “Wherein--”\r\n\r\nBut Watson interrupted. There was appeal in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” he went on, “I am asking. Somebody has got to wear this ring.\r\nHe must be a man. He must be fearless; he must taunt the devil. It is\r\nhard work, I assure you. I cannot last much longer. You loved the old\r\ndoctor. If we get at this law we have done more for mankind than either\r\nof us may do with his profession. We must save the old professor. He\r\nis living and he is waiting. There are perils and forces that we do not\r\nknow of. The doctor went at it alone and fearless; he succumbed to his\r\nown wisdom. I have followed after, and I have been crushed down--perhaps\r\nby my ignorance. I am not afraid. But I don't want my work to die.\r\nSomebody has got to take it on and you are the man.”\r\n\r\nThey were all of them looking at me. I studied the wonderful blue\r\nand its light. The image of the great professor had dimmed almost\r\ncompletely. It was a sudden task and a great one. Here was a law; one of\r\nthe great secrets of Cosmos. What was it? Somehow the lure caught into\r\nmy vitals. I couldn't picture myself ever coming to the extremity of\r\nmy companion. Besides, it was a duty. I owed it to the old doctor. It\r\nseemed somehow that he was speaking. Though Watson did the talking I\r\ncould feel him calling. Would I be afraid? Besides, there was the jewel.\r\nIt was calling; already I could feel it burning into my spirit. I looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Do you take it, Harry?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“I do. God knows I am worthless enough. I'll take it up. It may give me\r\na chance to engage with this famous Rhamda.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful of Rhamda, Harry. And above all don't let him have the\r\nring.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because. Now listen. I'm not laying this absolutely, understand.\r\nNevertheless the facts all point in one direction. Hold the ring.\r\nSomewhere in that lustre lies a great secret; it controls the Blind\r\nSpot. The Rhamda himself may not take it off your finger. You are immune\r\nfrom violence. Only the ring itself may kill you.”\r\n\r\nHe coughed.\r\n\r\n“God knows,” he spoke, “it has killed me.”\r\n\r\nIt was rather ominous. The mere fact of that cough and his weakness was\r\nenough. One would come to this. He had warned me, and he had besought me\r\nwith the same voice as the warning.\r\n\r\n“But what is the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“Then you take the ring? What is the time? Twelve. Gentlemen--”\r\n\r\nNow here comes in one of the strange parts of my story--one that I\r\ncannot account for. Over the shoulder of Dr. Hansen I could watch the\r\ndoor. Whether it was the ring or not I do not know. At the time I did\r\nnot reason. I acted upon impulse. It was an act beyond good breeding. I\r\nhad never done such a thing before. I had never even seen the woman.\r\n\r\nThe woman? Why do I say it? She was never a woman--she was a girl--far,\r\nfar transcendent. It was the first time I had ever seen her--standing\r\nthere before the door. I had never beheld such beauty, such profile,\r\npoise--the witching, laughing, night-black of her eyes; the perfectly\r\nbridged nose and the red, red lips that smiled, it seemed to me, in\r\nsadness. She hesitated, and as if puzzled, lifted a jewelled hand to\r\nher raven mass of hair. To this minute I cannot account for my action,\r\nunless, perchance, it was the ring. Perhaps it was. Anyway I had risen.\r\n\r\nHow well do I remember.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that I had known her a long, long time. There was\r\nsomething about her that was not seduction; but far, far above it.\r\nSomewhere I had seen her, had known her. She was looking and she was\r\nwaiting for me. There was something about her that was super feminine. I\r\nthought it then, and I say it now.\r\n\r\nJust then her glance came my way. She smiled, and nodded; there was a\r\nnote of sadness in her voice.\r\n\r\n“Harry Wendel!”\r\n\r\nThere is no accounting for my action, nor my wonder; she knew me. Then\r\nit was true! I was not mistaken! Somewhere I had seen her. I felt a\r\nvague and dim rush of dreamy recollections. Ah, that was the answer! She\r\nwas a girl of dreams and phantoms. Even then I knew it; she was not\r\na woman; not as we conceive her; she was some materialisation out of\r\nHeaven. Why do I talk so? Ah! this strange beauty that is woman! From\r\nthe very first she held me in the thrall that has no explanation.\r\n\r\n“Do we dance?” she asked simply.\r\n\r\nThe next moment I had her in my arms and we were out among the dancers.\r\nThat my actions were queer and entirely out of reason never occurred\r\nto me. There was a call about her beautiful body and in her eyes that\r\nI could not answer. There was a fact between us, some strange bond\r\nthat was beyond even passion. I danced, and in an extreme emotion of\r\nhappiness. A girl out of the dreams and the ether--a sprig of life woven\r\nout of the moonbeams!\r\n\r\n“Do you know me?” she asked as we danced.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I answered, “and no. I have seen you; but I do not remember; you\r\ncome from the sunshine.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed prettily.\r\n\r\n“Do you always talk like this?”\r\n\r\n“You are out of my dreams,” I answered: “it is sufficient. But who are\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nShe held back her pretty head and looked at me; her lips drooped\r\nslightly at the corners, a sad smile, and tender, in the soft wonderful\r\ndepths of her eyes--a pity.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” she asked, “are you going to wear this ring?”\r\n\r\nSo that was it. The ring and the maiden. What was the bond? There was\r\nweirdness in its colour, almost cabalistic--a call out of the occult.\r\nThe strange beauty of the girl, her remarkable presence, and her\r\nconcern. Whoever and whatever she was her anxiety was not personal. In\r\nsome way she was woven up with this ring and poor Watson.\r\n\r\n“I think I shall,” I answered.\r\n\r\nAgain the strange querulous pity and hesitation; her eyes grew darker,\r\nalmost pleading.\r\n\r\n“You won't give it to me?”\r\n\r\nHow near I came to doing it I shall not tell. It would be hard to say\r\nit. I knew vaguely that she was playing; that I was the plaything. It is\r\nhard for a man to think of himself as being toyed with. She was certain;\r\nshe was confident of my weakness. It was resentment, perhaps, and pride\r\nof self that gave the answer.\r\n\r\n“I think I shall keep it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the danger, Harry? It is death to wear it. A thousand\r\nperils--”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall keep it. I like peril. You wish for the ring. If I keep it\r\nI may have you. This is the first time I have danced with the girl out\r\nof the moonbeams.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes snapped, and she stopped dancing. I don't think my words\r\ndispleased her. She was still a woman.\r\n\r\n“Is this final? You're a fine young man, Mr. Wendel. I know you. I\r\nstepped in to save you. You are playing with something stranger than the\r\nmoonbeams. No man may wear that ring and hold to life. Again, Harry, I\r\nask you; for your own sake.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment we passed Watson. He was watching; as our eyes glanced\r\nhe shook his head. Who was this girl? She was as beautiful as sin and as\r\ntender as a virgin. What interest had she in myself?\r\n\r\n“That's just the reason,” I laughed. “You are too interested. You are\r\ntoo beautiful to wear it. I am a man; I revel in trouble; you are a\r\ngirl. It would not be honourable to allow you to take it. I shall keep\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nShe had overreached herself, and she knew it. She bit her lip. But she\r\ntook it gracefully; so much so, in fact, that I thought she meant it.\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry,” she answered slowly. “I had hopes. It is terrible to look\r\nat Watson and then to think of you. It is, really”--a faint tremor ran\r\nthrough her body; her hand trembled--“it is terrible. You young men are\r\nso unafraid. It's too bad.”\r\n\r\nJust then the door was opened; outside I could see the bank of fog;\r\nsomeone passed. She turned a bit pale.\r\n\r\n“Excuse me. I must be going. Don't you see I'm sorry--”\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand--the same sad little smile. On the impulse of the\r\nmoment, unmindful of place, I drew it to my lips and kissed it. She was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nI returned to the table. The three men were watching me: Watson\r\nanalytically, the doctor with wonder, and Hobart with plain disgust.\r\nHobart spoke first.\r\n\r\n“Nice for sister Charlotte, eh, Harry?”\r\n\r\nI had not a word to say. In the full rush of the moment I knew that he\r\nwas right. It was all out of reason. I had no excuse outside of sheer\r\ninsanity--and dishonour. The doctor said nothing. It was only in\r\nWatson's face that there was a bit of understanding.\r\n\r\n“Hobart,” he said, “I have told you. It is not Harry's fault. It is the\r\nNervina. No man may resist her. She is beauty incarnate; she weaves\r\nwith the hearts of men, and she loves no one. It is the ring. She, the\r\nRhamda, the Blind Spot, and the ring. I have never been able to unravel\r\nthem. Please don't blame Harry. He went to her even as I. She has but\r\nto beckon. But he kept the ring. I watched them. This is but the\r\nbeginning.”\r\n\r\nBut Hobart muttered: “She's a beauty all right--a beauty. That's the\r\nrub. I know Harry--I know him as a brother, and I want him so in fact.\r\nBut I'd hate to trust that woman.”\r\n\r\nWatson smiled.\r\n\r\n“Never fear, Hobart, your sister is safe enough. The Nervina is not a\r\nwoman. She is not of the flesh.”\r\n\r\n“Brr,” said the doctor, “you give me the creeps.”\r\n\r\nWatson reached for the brandy; he nodded to the doctor.\r\n\r\n“Just a bit more of that stuff if you please. Whatever it is, on the\r\nlast night one has no fear of habit. There--Now, gentlemen, if you will\r\ncome with me, I shall take you to the house of the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n“NOW THERE ARE THREE”\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that night. When we stepped to the pavement the\r\nwhole world was shrouded. The heavy fog clung like depression; life\r\nwas gone out--a foreboding of gloom and disaster. It was cold, dank,\r\nmiserable; one shuddered instinctively and battered against the wall\r\nwith steaming columns of breath. Just outside the door we were detained.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Hansen?”\r\n\r\nSomeone stepped beside us.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Hansen?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“A message, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor made a gesture of impatience.\r\n\r\n“Bother!” he spoke. “Bother! A message. Nothing in the world would stop\r\nme! I cannot leave.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless he stepped back into the light.\r\n\r\n“Just a minute, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\nHe tore open the envelope. Then he looked up at the messenger and then\r\nat us. His face was startled--almost frightened.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “I am sorry. Not a thing in the world would detain\r\nme but this. I would go with you, but I may not. My duty as a physician.\r\nI had hopes.” He came over to me and spoke softly. “I am going to send\r\nyou one of the greatest specialists in the city in my stead. This young\r\nman should have attention. Have you the address?”\r\n\r\n“288 Chatterton Place,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Very well. I am sorry, very much disappointed. However, it is\r\nmy daughter, and I cannot do otherwise. Continue the brandy for a\r\nwhile--and this.” He slipped an envelope into my hand. “By that time Dr.\r\nHiggins will be with you.”\r\n\r\n“You think there is hope?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“There's always hope,” replied the doctor.\r\n\r\nI returned to my companions. They were walking slowly. It was work for\r\npoor Watson. He dragged on, leaning on Hobart's arm. But at last he gave\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “I can't make it. I'm too far gone. I had thought--Oh,\r\nwhat a lapse it has been! I am eighty years of age; one year ago I was\r\na boy. If only I had some more brandy. I have some at the house. We must\r\nmake that. I must show you; there I can give you the details.”\r\n\r\n“Hail a cab,” I said. “Here's one now.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we were before the House of the Blind Spot. It was a\r\ntwo storey drab affair, much like a thousand others, old-fashioned, and\r\nmight have been built in the early nineties. It had been outside of the\r\nfire limits of 1906, and so had survived the great disaster. Chatterton\r\nPlace is really a short street running lengthwise along the summit of\r\nthe hill. A flight of stone steps descended to the pavement.\r\n\r\nWatson straightened up with an effort.\r\n\r\n“This is the house,” he spoke. “I came here a year ago. I go away\r\ntonight. I had hoped to find it. I promised Bertha. I came alone. I had\r\nreasons to believe I had solved it. I found the Rhamda and the Nervina.\r\nI had iron will and courage--also strength. The Rhamda was never able\r\nto control me. My life is gone but not my will. Now I have left him\r\nanother. Do not surrender, Harry. It is a gruesome task; but hold on\r\nto the end. Help me up the steps. There now. Just wait a minute till I\r\nfetch a stimulant.”\r\n\r\nHe did not ring for a servant. That I noticed. Instead he groped about\r\nfor a key, unlocked the door and stumbled into a room. He fumbled for a\r\nminute among some glasses.\r\n\r\n“Will you switch on a light?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHobart struck a match; when he found it he pressed the switch.\r\n\r\nThe room in which we were standing was a large one, fairly well\r\nfurnished, and lined on two sides with bookshelves; in the centre was an\r\noak table cluttered with papers, a couple of chairs, and on one of them,\r\na heavy pipe, which, somehow, I did not think of as Watson's. He noticed\r\nmy look.\r\n\r\n“Jerome's,” he explained. “We live here--Jerome, the detective, and\r\nmyself. He has been here since the day of the doctor's disappearance. I\r\ncame here a year ago. He is in Nevada at present. That leaves me alone.\r\nYou will notice the books, mostly occult: partly mine, partly the\r\ndetective's. We have gone at it systematically from the beginning.\r\nWe have learned almost everything but what would help us. Mostly\r\nsophistry--and guesswork. Beats all how much ink has been wasted to say\r\nnothing. We were after the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“But what is it? Is it in this house?”\r\n\r\n“I can answer one part of your question,” he answered, “but not the\r\nother. It is here somewhere, in some place. Jerome is positive of that.\r\nYou remember the old lady? The one who died? Her actions were rather\r\npositive even if feeble. She led Jerome to this next room.” He turned\r\nand pointed; the door was open. I could see a sofa and a few chairs;\r\nthat was all.\r\n\r\n“It was in here. The bell. Jerome never gets tired of telling. A church\r\nbell. In the centre of the room. At first I didn't believe; but now I\r\naccept it all. I know, but what I know is by intuition.”\r\n\r\n“Sort of sixth sense?'\r\n\r\n“Yes. Or foresight.”\r\n\r\n“You never saw this bell nor found it? Never were able to arrive at an\r\nexplanation?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“How about the Rhamda? The Nervina? Do they come to this house?”\r\n\r\n“Not often.”\r\n\r\n“How do they come in? Through the window?”\r\n\r\nHe smiled rather sadly. “I don't know. At least they come. You shall see\r\nthem yourself. The Rhamda still has something to do with Dr. Holcomb.\r\nSomehow his very concern tells me the doctor is safe. Undoubtedly\r\nthe professor made a great discovery. But he was not alone. He had\r\na co-worker--the Rhamda. For reasons of his own the Rhamda wishes to\r\ncontrol the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“Then the professor is in this Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“We think so. At least it is our conjecture. We do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Then you don't think it trickery?”\r\n\r\n“No, hardly. Harry, you know better than that. Can you imagine the great\r\ndoctor the dupe of a mere trickster? The professor was a man of great\r\nscience and was blessed with an almighty sound head. But he had one\r\nweakness.”\r\n\r\nHobart spoke up.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Chick? I think I know what you mean. The old boy was\r\nhonest?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. He had been a scholar all his life. He taught ethics. He\r\nbelieved in right. He practised his creed. When he came to the crucial\r\nexperiment he found himself dealing with a rogue. The Rhamda helped him\r\njust so far; but once he had the professor in his power it was not his\r\npurpose to release him until he was secure of the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” I spoke. “The man is a villain. I think we can handle him.”\r\n\r\nBut Watson shook his head.\r\n\r\n“That's just it, Harry! The man! If he were a man I could have handled\r\nhim in short order. That's what I thought at first. Don't make any\r\nmistake. Don't try violence. That's the whole crux of the difficulty. If\r\nhe were only a man! Unfortunately, he is not.”\r\n\r\n“Not a man!” I exclaimed. “What do you mean? Then, what is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is a phantom.”\r\n\r\nI glanced at Hobart and caught his eye. Hobart believed him! The poor\r\npallid face of Watson, the athlete; there was nothing left to him but\r\nhis soul! I shall not forget Watson as he sat there, his lean, long\r\nfingers grasping the brandy glass, his eyes burning and his life holding\r\nback from the pit through sheer will and courage. Would I come to this?\r\nWould I have the strength to measure up to his standard?\r\n\r\nHobart broke the tension.\r\n\r\n“Chick's right. There is something in it, Harry. Not all the secrets of\r\nthe universe have been unlocked by any means. Now, Chick, about details.\r\nHave you any data--any notes?”\r\n\r\nWatson rose. I could see he was grateful.\r\n\r\n“You believe me, don't you, Hobart? It is good. I had hoped to find\r\nsomeone, and I found you two. Harry, remember what I have told you. Hold\r\nthe ring. You take my place. Whatever happens, stick out to the end. You\r\nhave Hobart here to help you. Now just a minute. The library is here;\r\nyou can look over my books. I shall return in a moment.”\r\n\r\nHe stepped out into the hall; we could hear his weary feet dragging down\r\nthe hallway--a hollow sound and a bit uncanny. Somehow my mind rambled\r\nback to that account I had read in the newspaper--Jerome's story--“Like\r\nweary bones dragging slippers.” And the old lady. Who was she? Why was\r\neveryone in this house pulled down to exhaustion--the words of the\r\nold lady, I could almost hear them; the dank air murmuring their\r\nrecollection. “Now there are two. Now there are two!”\r\n\r\n“What's the matter, Harry?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was frightened. I do not know. I looked around. The sound of\r\nWatson's footsteps had died away; there was a light in the back of the\r\nbuilding coming toward us.\r\n\r\n“Nothing! Only--damn this place, Hobart. Don't you notice it? It's\r\nenough to eat your heart out.”\r\n\r\n“Rather interesting,” said Hobart. It was too interesting for me. I\r\nstepped over to the shelves and looked at the titles. Sanskrit and\r\nGreek; German and French--the Vedas, Sir Oliver Lodge, Besant, Spinoza,\r\na conglomeration of all ages and tongues; a range of metaphysics that\r\nwas as wide as Babel, and about as enlightening. As Babel? Over my\r\nshoulders came the strangest sound of all, weak, piping, tremulous,\r\nfearful--“Now there are two. Now there are two.” My heart gave a fearful\r\nleap. “Soon there will be three! Soon--”\r\n\r\nI turned suddenly about. I had a fearful thought. I looked at Hobart.\r\nA strange, insidious fear clutched at me. Was the thought intrinsic? If\r\nnot, where had it come from? Three? I strained my ears to hear Watson's\r\nfootsteps. He was in the back part of the building. I must have some\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“I'm going to open the door, Hobart,” I spoke. “The front door, and look\r\nout into the street.”\r\n\r\n“Don't blame you much. Feel a bit that way myself. About time for Dr.\r\nHiggins. Here comes Chick again. Take a look outside and see if the doc\r\nis coming.”\r\n\r\nI opened the door and looked out into the dripping fog bank. What a pair\r\nof fools we were! We both knew it, and we were both seeking an excuse.\r\nIn the next room through the curtains I could see the weak form of\r\nWatson; he was bearing a light.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the light went out.\r\n\r\nI was at high tension; the mere fact of the light was nothing, but it\r\nmeant a world at that moment--a strange sound--a struggle--then the\r\nwords of Watson--Chick Watson's:\r\n\r\n“Harry! Harry! Hobart! Harry! Come here! It's the Blind Spot!”\r\n\r\nIt was in the next room. The despair of that call is unforgettable, like\r\nthat of one suddenly falling into space. Then the light dropped to the\r\nfloor. I could see the outlines of his figure and a weird, single string\r\nof incandescence. Hobart turned and I leaped. It was a blur, the form\r\nof a man melting into nothing. I sprang into the room, tearing down the\r\ncurtains. Hobart was on top of me. But we were too late. I could\r\nfeel the vibrancy of something uncanny as I rushed across the space\r\nintervening. Through my mind darted the thrill of terror. It had come\r\nsuddenly, and in climax. It was over before it had commenced. The light\r\nhad gone out. Only by the gleam from the other room could we make out\r\neach others' faces. The air was vibrant, magnetic. There was no Watson.\r\nBut we could hear his voice. Dim and fearful, coming down the corridors\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n“Hold that ring, Harry! Hold that ring!” Then the faint despair out of\r\nthe weary distance, faint, but a whole volume:\r\n\r\n“The Blind Spot!”\r\n\r\nIt was over as quickly as that. The whole thing climaxed into an\r\ninstant. It is difficult to describe. One cannot always analyse\r\nsensations. Mine, I am afraid, were muddled. A thousand insistent\r\nthoughts clashed through my brain. Horror, wonder, doubt! I have only\r\none persistent and predominating recollection. The old lady! I could\r\nalmost feel her coming out of the shadows. There was sadness and pity;\r\nout of the stillness and the corners. What had been the dirge of her\r\nsorrow?\r\n\r\n“NOW THERE ARE THREE!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nMAN OR PHANTOM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was Hobart who came to first. His voice was good to hear. It\r\nwas natural; it was sweet and human, but it was pregnant with\r\ndisappointment: “We are fools, Harry; we are fools!”\r\n\r\nBut I could only stare. I remember saying: “The Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Hobart, “the Blind Spot. But what is it? We saw him go.\r\nDid you see it?”\r\n\r\n“It gets me,” I answered. “He just vanished into space. It--” Frankly I\r\nwas afraid.\r\n\r\n“It tallies well with the reports. The old lady and Jerome. Remember?”\r\n\r\n“And the bell?” I looked about the room.\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Phenomena! Watson was right. I just wonder--but the bell?\r\nRemember the doctor? 'The greatest day since Columbus.' No, don't cross\r\nthe room, Harry, I'm a bit leery: A great discovery! I should say it\r\nwas. How do you account for it?”\r\n\r\n“Supernatural.”\r\n\r\nFenton shook his head.\r\n\r\n“By no means! It's the gateway to the universe--into Cosmos.” His eyes\r\nsparkled. “My Lord, Harry! Don't you see! Once we control it. The Blind\r\nSpot! What is beyond? We saw Chick Watson go. Before our eyes. Where did\r\nhe go to? It beats death itself.”\r\n\r\nI started across the room, but Hobart caught me with both arms: “No, no,\r\nno, Harry. My Lord! I don't want to lose you. No! You foolhardly little\r\ncuss--stand back!”\r\n\r\nHe threw me violently against the wall. The impact quite took my breath.\r\n\r\nOn the instant the old rush of temper surged up in me. From boyhood we\r\nhad these moments. Hobart settled himself and awaited the rush that he\r\nknew was coming. In his great, calm, brute strength there was still a\r\ngreatness of love.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” he was saying, “for the love of Heaven, listen to reason! Have\r\nwe got to have a knock-down and drag-out on this of all nights? Have I\r\ngot to lick you again? Do you want to roll into the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\nWhy did God curse me with such a temper? On such moments as this I could\r\nfeel something within me snapping. It was fury and unreason. How I loved\r\nhim! And yet we had fought a thousand times over just such provocation.\r\nOver his shoulders I could see the still open door that led into the\r\nstreet. A heavy form was looming through the opening; out of the corner\r\nof my eye I caught the lines of the form stepping out of the shadows--it\r\ncrossed the room and stood beside Hobart Fenton. It was Rhamda Avec!\r\n\r\nI leaped. The fury of a thousand conflicts--and the exultation. For the\r\nglory of such moments it is well worth dying. One minute flying through\r\nthe air--the old catapult tackle--and the next a crashing of bone\r\nand sinew. We rolled over, head on, and across the floor. Curses and\r\nexecrations; the deep bass voice of Hobart:\r\n\r\n“Hold him, Harry! Hold him! That's the way! Hold him! Hold him!”\r\n\r\nWe went crashing about the room. He was the slipperiest thing I had ever\r\nlaid hold of. But he was bone--bone and sinew; he was a man! I remember\r\nthe wild thrill of exultation at the discovery. It was battle! And\r\ndeath! The table went over, we went spinning against the wall, a crash\r\nof falling bookcases, books and broken glass, a scurry and a flying heap\r\nof legs and arms. He was wonderfully strong and active, like a panther.\r\nEach time I held him he would twist out like a cat, straighten, and\r\nthrow me out of hold. I clung on, fighting, striving for a grip, working\r\nfor the throat. He was a man--a man! I remembered that he must never get\r\naway. He must account for Watson.\r\n\r\nIn the first rush I was a madman. The mere force of my onslaught had\r\nborne him down. But in a moment he had recovered and was fighting\r\nsystematically. As much as he could he kept over on one side of me,\r\nalways forcing me toward the inner room where Watson had disappeared. In\r\nspite of my fury he eluded every effort that I made for a vital part. We\r\nrolled, fought, struck and struggled.\r\n\r\nI could hear Hobart's bass thundering: “Over! Over! Under! Look out! Now\r\nyou've got him! Harry! Harry! Look out! Hold him, for the love of Heaven\r\nI see his trick. That's his trick. The Blind Spot!”\r\n\r\nWe were rolled clear over, picked, heaved, shoved against the front\r\nwall. There were three! The great heaving bulk of Fenton; the fighting\r\ntiger between us; and myself! Surely such strength was not human; we\r\ncould not pin him; his quickness was uncanny; he would uncoil, twist\r\nhimself and throw us loose. Gradually he worked us away from the front\r\nwall and into the centre of the room.\r\n\r\nCould any mere man fight so? Hobart was as good as a ton; I was as much\r\nfor action. Slowly, slowly in spite of our efforts, he was working us\r\ntowards the Blind Spot. Confident of success, he was over, around, and\r\nin and under. In a spin of a second he went into the attack. He fairly\r\nbore us off our feet. We were on the last inch of our line; the stake\r\nwas--\r\n\r\nWhat was it? We all went down. A great volume of sound! We were inside\r\na bell! My whole head buzzed to music and a roar; the whir of a thousand\r\nvibrations; the inside of sound. I fell face downwards; the room went\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nWhat was it? How long I lay there I don't know. A dim light was burning.\r\nI was in a room. The ceiling overhead was worked in a grotesque pattern;\r\nI could not make it out. My clothes were in tatters and my hand was\r\ncovered with blood. Something warm was trickling down my face. What was\r\nit? The air was still and sodden. Who was this man beside me? And what\r\nwas this smell of roses?\r\n\r\nI lay still for a minute, thinking. Ah, yes! It came back. Watson--Chick\r\nWatson! The Blind Spot! The Rhamda and the bell!\r\n\r\nSurely it was a dream. How could all this be in one short night? It was\r\nlike a nightmare and impossible. I raised up on my elbow and looked at\r\nthe form beside me. It was Hobart Fenton. He was unconscious.\r\n\r\nFor a moment my mind was whirring; I was too weak and unsteady. I\r\ndropped back and wondered absently at the roses. Roses meant\r\nperfume, and perfume meant a woman. What could--something touched my\r\nface--something soft; it plucked tenderly at my tangled hair and drew it\r\naway from my forehead. It was the hand of a woman!\r\n\r\n“You poor, foolish boy! You foolish boy!”\r\n\r\nSomewhere I had heard that voice; it held a touch of sadness; it was\r\nfamiliar; it was soft and silken like music that might have been woven\r\nout of the moonbeams. Who was it that always made me think of moonbeams?\r\nI lay still, thinking.\r\n\r\n“He dared; he dared; he dared!” she was saying. “As if there were not\r\ntwo! He shall pay for this! Am I to be a plaything? You poor boy!”\r\n\r\nThen I remembered. I looked up. It was the Nervina. She was stooping\r\nover with my head against her. How beautiful her eyes were! In their\r\ndepths was a pathos and a tenderness that was past a woman's, the same\r\nslight droop at the corners of the mouth, and the wistfulness; her\r\nfeatures were relaxed like a mother's--a wondrous sweetness and pity.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” she asked, “where is Watson? Did he go?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“Into the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. What is the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\nShe ignored the question.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry” she answered. “So sorry. I would have saved him. And the\r\nRhamda; was he here, too?”\r\n\r\nI nodded. Her eyes flashed wickedly.\r\n\r\n“And--and you--tell me, did you fight with the Rhamda? You--”\r\n\r\n“It was Watson,” I interrupted. “This Rhamda is behind it all. He is the\r\nvillain. He can fight like a tiger; whoever he is he can fight.”\r\n\r\nShe frowned slightly; she shook her head.\r\n\r\n“You young men,” she said. “You young men! You are all alike! Why must\r\nit be? I am so sorry. And you fought with the Rhamda? You could not\r\novercome him, of course. But tell me, how could you resist him? What did\r\nyou do?”\r\n\r\nWhat did she mean? I had felt his flesh and muscle. He was a man. Why\r\ncould he not be conquered--not be resisted?\r\n\r\n“I don't understand,” I answered. “He is a man. I fought him. He was\r\nhere. Let him account for Watson. We fought alone at first, until\r\nhe tried to throw me into this Thing. Then Hobart stepped in. Once I\r\nthought we had him, but he was too slippery. He came near putting us\r\nboth in. I don't know. Something happened--a bell.”\r\n\r\nHer hand was on my arm, she clutched it tightly, she swallowed hard; in\r\nher eyes flashed the fire that I had noticed once before, the softness\r\ndied out, and their glint was almost terrible.\r\n\r\n“He! The bell saved you? He would dare to throw you into the Blind\r\nSpot!”\r\n\r\nI lay back. I was terribly weak and uncertain. This beautiful woman!\r\nWhat was her interest in myself?\r\n\r\n“Harry,” she spoke, “let me ask you. I am your friend. If you only knew!\r\nI would save you. It must not be. Will you give me the ring? If I could\r\nonly tell you! You must not have it. It is death--yes, worse than death.\r\nNo man may wear it.”\r\n\r\nSo that was it. Again and so soon I was to be tempted. Was her concern\r\nfeigned or real? Why did she call me Harry? Why did I not resent it? She\r\nwas wonderful; she was beautiful; she was pure. Was it merely a subtle\r\nact for the Rhamda? I could still hear Watson's voice ringing out of the\r\nBlind Spot; “Hold the ring! Hold the ring!” I could not be false to my\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“Tell me first,” I asked. “Who is this Rhamda? What is he? Is he a man?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nNot a man! I remembered Watson's words: “A phantom!” How could it be? At\r\nleast I would find out what I could.\r\n\r\n“Then tell me, what is he?”\r\n\r\n“She smiled faintly; again the elusive tenderness lingered about her\r\nlips, the wistful droop at the corners.\r\n\r\n“That I may not tell you, Harry. You couldn't understand. If only I\r\ncould.”\r\n\r\nCertainly I couldn't understand her evasion. I studied and watched\r\nher--her wondrous hair, the perfection of her throat, the curve of her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n“Then he is supernatural.”\r\n\r\n“No, not that, Harry. That would explain everything. One cannot go above\r\nNature. He is living just as you are.”\r\n\r\nI studied a moment.\r\n\r\n“Are you a woman?” I asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should not have asked it; she was so sad and beautiful,\r\nsomehow I could not doubt her sincerity. There was a burden at the\r\nback of her sadness, some great yearning unsatisfied, unattainable.\r\nShe dropped her head. The hand upon my arm quivered and clutched\r\nspasmodically; I caught the least sound of a sob. When I looked up her\r\neyes were wet and sparkling.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said. “Harry, why do you ask it? A woman! Harry, a woman! To\r\nlive and love and to be loved. What must it be? There is so much of life\r\nthat is sweet and pure. I love it--I love it! I can have everything\r\nbut the most exalted thing of all. I can live, see, enjoy, think, but I\r\ncannot have love. You knew it from the first. How did you know it? You\r\nsaid--Ah, it is true! I am out of the moonbeams.” She controlled herself\r\nsuddenly. “Excuse me,” she said simply. “But you can never understand.\r\nMay I have the ring?”\r\n\r\nIt was like a dream--her beauty, her voice, everything. But I could\r\nstill hear Watson. I was to be tempted, cajoled, flattered. What was\r\nthis story out of the moonbeams? Certainly she was the most beautiful\r\ngirl I had ever seen. Why had I asked such a question?\r\n\r\n“I shall keep the ring,” I answered.\r\n\r\nShe sighed. A strange weakness came over me; I was drowsy; I lapsed\r\nagain into unconsciousness; just as I was fading away I heard her\r\nspeaking: “I am so sorry!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nBAFFLED\r\n\r\n\r\nWas it a dream? The next I knew somebody was dousing water down my neck.\r\nIt was Hobart Fenton. “Lord,” he was saying, “I thought you were never\r\ncoming to. What hit us? You are pretty well cut up. That was some fight.\r\nThis Rhamda, who is he? Can you figure him out? Did you hear that bell?\r\nWhat was it?”\r\n\r\nI sat up. “Where is the Nervina?” I asked. “The who?” He was bewildered.\r\n“Oh, down at the cafe, I suppose. Thought you had forgotten her. Wasn't\r\nher mate enough? It might be healthy to forget his Nervina.”\r\n\r\nHe was a fine sight; his clothes were in ribbons; his plump figure was\r\nbreaking out at the seams. He regarded me critically.\r\n\r\n“What d'you think of the Blind Spot?” he asked. “Who is the Rhamda? He\r\nput us out pretty easily.”\r\n\r\n“But the girl?” I interrupted. “The girl? Confound it, the girl?”\r\n\r\nIt was sometime before I could make him understand; even then he refused\r\nto believe me.\r\n\r\n“It was all a dream,” he said; “all a dream.”\r\n\r\nBut I was certain.\r\n\r\nFenton began prodding about the room. I do not believe any apartment was\r\never so thoroughly ransacked. We even tore up the carpet. When we were\r\nthrough he sat in the midst of the debris and wiped his forehead.\r\n\r\n“It's no use, Harry--no use. We might have known better. It can't be\r\ndone. Yet you say you saw a string of incandescence.”\r\n\r\n“A single string; the form of Watson; a blur--then nothing,” I answered.\r\n\r\nHe thought. He quoted the professor:\r\n\r\n“'Out of the occult I shall bring you the proof and the substance. It\r\nwill be concrete--within the reach of your senses.' Isn't that what the\r\ndoctor said?”\r\n\r\n“Then you believe Professor Holcomb?”\r\n\r\n“Why not? Didn't we see it? I know a deal of material science; but\r\nnothing like this. I always had faith in Dr. Holcomb. After all, it's\r\nnot impossible. First we must go over the house thoroughly.”\r\n\r\nWe did. Most of all, we were interested in that bell. We did not think,\r\neither of us, that so much noise could come out of nothing. It was too\r\nmaterial. The other we could credit to the occult; but not the sound. It\r\nhad drowned our consciousness; perhaps it had saved us from the Rhamda.\r\nBut we found nothing. We went over the house systematically. It was much\r\nas it had been previously described, only now a bit more furnished. The\r\nsame dank, musty smell and the same suggestive silence. We returned to\r\nthe lower floor and the library. It was a sorry sight. We straightened\r\nup the shelves and returned the books to their places.\r\n\r\nIt was getting along toward morning. Hobart sailed at nine o'clock. We\r\nmust have new clothing and some coffee; likewise we must collect our\r\nwits. I had the ring, and had given my pledge to Watson. I was muddled.\r\nWe must get down to sane action. First of all we must return to our\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nThe fog had grown thicker; one could almost taste it. I couldn't\r\nsuppress a shudder. It was cold, dank, repressive. Neither of us spoke\r\na word on our way downtown. Hobart opened the door to our apartment; he\r\nturned on the lights.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we had hot, steaming cups of coffee. Still we did not\r\nspeak. Hobart sat in his chair, his elbows on the table and his head\r\nbetween his hands. My thoughts ran back to that day in college when he\r\nsaid “I was just thinking, Harry, if I had one hundred thousand dollars,\r\nI would solve the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\nThat was long ago. We had neither of us thought that we would come to\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I spoke, “have you got that hundred thousand dollars? You had an\r\nidea once.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up. “I've got it yet. I am not certain. It is merely a theory.\r\nBut it's not impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it?”\r\n\r\nHe took another drink of coffee and settled back in his chair.\r\n\r\n“It is energy, Harry--force. Nothing but energy--and Nature.”\r\n\r\n“Then it's not occult?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Certainly it is. I didn't say that. It is what the professor promised.\r\nSomething concrete for our senses. If the occult is, it can certainly be\r\nproven. The professor was right. It is energy, force, vibration. It has\r\na law. The old doctor was caught somehow. We must watch our step and\r\nsee that we aren't swallowed up also. Perhaps we shall go the way of\r\nWatson.”\r\n\r\nI shuddered.\r\n\r\n“I hope not. But explain. You speak in volumes. Come back to earth.”\r\n\r\n“That's easy, Harry. I can give you my theory in a few short words.\r\nYou've studied physiology, haven't you? Well, that's where you can get\r\nyour proof--or rather let me say my theory. What is the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“In optics?”\r\n\r\n“We'll forgo that,” he answered. “I refer to this one.”\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “I don't know. It was something I couldn't see. Watson\r\nwent out before our eyes. He was lost.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Do you get the point?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It is this. What you see is merely energy. Your eye is merely a\r\nmachine. It catches certain colours. Which in turn are merely rates of\r\nvibration. There is nothing to matter but force, Harry; if we could get\r\ndown deep enough and know a few laws, we could transmute it.”\r\n\r\n“What has it to do with the occult?”\r\n\r\n“Merely a fact. The eye machine catches only certain vibration speeds of\r\nenergy. There are undoubtedly any number of speeds; the eye cannot see\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“Then this would account for the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. A localised spot, a condition, a combination of phenomena,\r\nanything entering it becomes invisible.”\r\n\r\n“Where does it go to?”\r\n\r\n“That's it. Where? It's one of the things that man has been guessing at\r\ndown the ages. The professor is the first philosopher with sound sense.\r\nHe went after it. It's a pity he was trapped.”\r\n\r\n“By the Rhamda?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?”\r\n\r\nHobart smiled.\r\n\r\n“How do I know? Where did he come from? If we knew that, we would know\r\neverything. 'A phantom,' so Watson says. If so, it only strengthens\r\nour theory. It would make a man and matter only a part of creation.\r\nCertainly it would clear up a lot of doubts.”\r\n\r\n“And the ring?”\r\n\r\n“It controls the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“That's for us to find out.”\r\n\r\n“And Watson? He is in this land of doubt?”\r\n\r\n“At least he is in the Blind Spot. Let me try the ring.”\r\n\r\nHe struck a match.\r\n\r\nIt was much as it had been in the restaurant, only a bit more startling.\r\nThen the blue faded, the colour went out, and it became transparent. For\r\na moment. There was an effect of space and distance that I had not noted\r\nbefore, almost marvellous. If I could describe it at all, I would say\r\na crystal corridor of a vastness that can scarcely be imagined. It\r\nmade one dizzy, even in that bit of jewel: one lost proportion, it was\r\nheight, distance, space immeasurable. For an instant. Then the whole\r\nthing blurred and clouded. Something passed across the face; the\r\ntransparency turned to opaqueness, and then--two men. It was as sudden\r\nas a flash--the materialisation. There was no question. They were alive.\r\nWatson was with the professor.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange moment. Only an hour before one of them had been\r\nwith us. It was Watson, beyond a doubt. He was alive; one could almost\r\nbelieve him in the jewel. We had heard his story: “The screen of the\r\noccult; the curtain of shadow.” We had seen him go. There was an element\r\nof horror in the thing, and of fascination. The great professor! The\r\nfaithful Watson! Where had they gone?\r\n\r\nIt was not until the colour had come back and the blue had regained its\r\nlustre that either of us looked up. Could such a thing be unravelled?\r\nFenton turned the stone over thoughtfully. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n“In that jewel, Harry, lies the secret. I wish I knew a bit more about\r\nphysics, light, force, energy, vibration. We have got to know.”\r\n\r\n“Your theory?”\r\n\r\n“It still holds good.”\r\n\r\nI thought.\r\n\r\n“Let me get it clear, Hobart. You say that we catch only certain\r\nvibrations.”\r\n\r\n“That's it. Our eyes are instruments, nothing else. We can see light,\r\nbut we cannot hear it. We hear sound, but we cannot see it. Of course\r\nthey are not exactly parallel. But it serves the point. Let's go a\r\nbit further. The eye picks up certain vibrations. Light is nothing but\r\nenergy vibrating at a tremendous speed. It has to be just so high for\r\nthe eye to pick it up. A great deal we do not get. For instance, we can\r\nonly catch one-twelfth of the solar spectrum. Until recently we have\r\nbelieved only what we could see. Science has pulled us out of the rut.\r\nIt may pull us through the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“And beyond.”\r\n\r\nHobart held up his hands.\r\n\r\n“It is almost too much to believe. We have made a discovery. We must\r\nwatch our step. We must not lose. The work of Dr. Holcomb shall not go\r\nfor nothing.”\r\n\r\n“And the ring?”\r\n\r\nHe consulted his watch.\r\n\r\n“We have only a short time left. We must map our action. We have three\r\nthings to work on--the ring, the house, Bertha Holcomb. It's all up to\r\nyou, Harry. Find out all that is possible; but go slow. Trace down\r\nthat ring; find out everything that you can. Go and see Bertha Holcomb.\r\nPerhaps she can give you some data. Watson said no; but perhaps you may\r\nuncover it. Take the ring to a lapidary; but don't let him cut it. Last\r\nof all, and most important, buy the house of the Blind Spot. Draw on me.\r\nLet me pay half, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“I shall move into it,” I answered.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated a bit.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid of that,” he answered. “Well, if you wish. Only be careful.\r\nRemember I shall return just as soon as I can get loose. If you feel\r\nyourself slipping or anything happens, send me a cable.”\r\n\r\nThe hours passed all too quickly. When day came we had our breakfast\r\nand hurried down to the pier. It was hard to have him go. His last words\r\nwere like Hobart Fenton. He repeated the warning.\r\n\r\n“Watch your step, Harry; watch your step. Take things easy; be cautious.\r\nGet the house. Trace down the ring. Be sure of yourself. Keep me\r\ninformed. If you need me, cable. I'll come if I have to swim.”\r\n\r\nHis last words; and not a year ago. It seems now like a lifetime. As I\r\nstood upon the pier and watched the ship slipping into the water, I felt\r\nit coming upon me. It had grown steadily, a gloom and oppression not to\r\nbe thwarted; it is silent and subtle and past defining--like shadow. The\r\ngrey, heavy heave of the water; the great hull of the steamer backing\r\ninto the bay; the gloom of the fog bank. A few uncertain lines, the\r\nshrill of the siren, the mist settling; I was alone. It was isolation.\r\n\r\nI had been warned by Watson. But I had not guessed. At the moment\r\nI sensed it. It was the beginning. Out of my heart I could feel\r\nit--solitude.\r\n\r\nIn the great and populous city I was to be alone, in all its teeming\r\nlife I was to be a stranger. It has been almost a year--a year! It has\r\nbeen a lifetime. A breaking down of life!\r\n\r\nI have waited and fought and sought to conquer. One cannot fight against\r\nshadow. It is merciless and inexorable. There are secrets that may be\r\nlocked forever. It was my duty, my pledge to Watson, what I owed to the\r\nprofessor. I have hung on grimly; what the end will be I do not know. I\r\nhave cabled for Fenton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nA DEAL IN PROPERTY\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to return. There was work that I should do--much work if I was going\r\nafter the solution. In the first place, there was the house. I turned\r\nmy back to the waterfront and entered the city. The streets were packed,\r\nthe commerce of man jostled and threaded along the highways; there was\r\nlife and action, hope, ambition. It was what I had loved so well. Yet\r\nnow it was different.\r\n\r\nI realised it vaguely, and wondered. This feeling of aloofness? It was\r\nintrinsic, coming from within, like the withering of one's marrow. I\r\nlaughed at my foreboding; it was not natural; I tried to shake myself\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty with the records. In less than an hour I traced out\r\nthe owners, “an estate,” and had located the agent. It just so happened\r\nthat he was a man with whom I had some acquaintance. We were not long in\r\ncoming to business.\r\n\r\n“The house at No. 288 Chatterton Place?”\r\n\r\nI noticed that he was startled; there was a bit of wonder in his look--a\r\nquizzical alertness. He motioned me to a chair and closed the door.\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Mr. Wendel; sit down. H-m! The house at No. 288 Chatterton\r\nPlace? Did I hear you right?”\r\n\r\nAgain I noted the wonder; his manner was cautious and curious. I nodded.\r\n\r\n“Want to buy it or just lease it? Pardon me, but you are sort of a\r\nfriend. I would not like to lose your friendship for the sake of a mere\r\nsale. What is your--”\r\n\r\n“Just for a residence,” I insisted. “A place to live in.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Know anything about this place?”\r\n\r\n“Do you?”\r\n\r\nHe fumbled with some papers. For an agent he did not strike me as being\r\nvery solicitous for a commission.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “in a way, yes. A whole lot more than I'd like to. It\r\nall depends. One gets much from hearsay. What I know is mostly\r\nrumour.” He began marking with a pencil. “Of course I don't believe it.\r\nNevertheless I would hardly recommend it to a friend as a residence.”\r\n\r\n“And these rumours?”\r\n\r\nHe looked up; for a moment he studied; then:\r\n\r\n“Ever hear of the Blind Spot? Perhaps you remember Dr. Holcomb--in 1905,\r\nbefore the 'quake. It was a murder. The papers were full of it at the\r\ntime; since then it has been occasionally featured in the supplements. I\r\ndo not believe in the story; but I can trust to facts. The last seen of\r\nDr. Holcomb was in this house. It is called the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“Then you believe in the story?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked at me.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you know it, eh? No, I do not. It's all bunkum; reporters' work\r\nand exaggeration. If you like that kind of stuff, it's weird and\r\ninteresting. But it hurts property. The man was undoubtedly murdered.\r\nThe tale hangs over the house. It's impossible to dispose of the place.”\r\n\r\n“Then why not sell it to me?”\r\n\r\nHe dropped his pencil; he was a bit nervous.\r\n\r\n“A fair question, Mr. Wendel--a very fair question. Well, now, why don't\r\nI? Perhaps I shall. There's no telling. But I'd rather not. Do you know,\r\na year ago I would have jumped at an offer. Fact is, I did lease it--the\r\nlease ran out yesterday--to a man named Watson. I don't believe a thing\r\nin this nonsense; but what I have seen during the past year has tested\r\nmy nerve considerably.”\r\n\r\n“What about Watson?”\r\n\r\n“Watson? A year ago he came to see me in regard to this Chatterton\r\nproperty. Wanted to lease it. Was interested in the case of Dr. Holcomb;\r\nasked for a year's rental and the privilege of renewal. I don't know. I\r\ngave it to him; but when he drops in again I am going to fight almighty\r\nhard against letting him hold it longer.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Why, because I don't believe in murder. A year ago he came to\r\nme the healthiest and happiest man I ever saw; today he is a shadow. I\r\nwatched that boy go down. Understand, I don't believe a damn word I'm\r\nsaying; but I have seen it. It's that cursed house. I say no, when\r\nI reason; but it keeps on my nerves; it's on my conscience. It is\r\ninsidious. Every month when he came here I could see disintegration.\r\nIt's pitiful to see a young man stripped of life like that; forlorn,\r\nhopeless, gone. He has never told me what it is; but I have wondered. A\r\nbattle; some conflict with--there I go again. It's on my nerves, I tell\r\nyou, on my nerves. If this keeps up I'll burn it.”\r\n\r\nIt was a bit foreboding. Already I could feel the tugging at my heart\r\nthat had done for Watson. This man had watched my friend slipping into\r\nthe shadow; I had come to take his place.\r\n\r\n“Watson has gone,” I said simply; “and that's why I am here.”\r\n\r\nHe straightened up.\r\n\r\n“You know him then. He was not--”\r\n\r\n“He went last night; he has left the country. He was in very poor\r\nhealth. That's why I am here. I know very well the cloud that hangs over\r\nthe property; it is my sole reason for purchasing.”\r\n\r\n“You don't believe in this nonsense?”\r\n\r\nI smiled. Certainly the man was perverse in his agnosticism; he was\r\nstubborn in disbelief. It was on his nerves; on his conscience; he was\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n“I believe nothing,” I answered; “neither do I disbelieve. I know all\r\nthe story that has been told or written. I am a friend of Watson. You\r\nneed not scruple in making me out a bill of sale. It's my own funeral. I\r\nabide by the consequences.”\r\n\r\nHe gave a sigh of relief. After all, he was human. He had honour; but\r\nit was after the brand of Pontius Pilate. He wished nothing on his\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nArmed with the keys and the legal title, I took possession. In the\r\ndaylight it was much as it had been the night before. Once across its\r\nthreshold, one was in dank and furtive suppression; the air was heavy;\r\na mould of age had streaked the walls and gloomed the shadows. I put up\r\nall the curtains to let in the rush of sunlight, likewise I opened the\r\nwindows. If there is anything to beat down sin, it is the open measure\r\nof broad daylight.\r\n\r\nThe house was well situated; from the front windows one could look down\r\nthe street and out at the blue bay beyond the city. The fog had lifted\r\nand the sun was shining upon the water. I could make out the ferryboats,\r\nthe islands, and the long piers that lead to Oakland, and still farther\r\nbeyond the hills of Berkeley. It was a long time since those days in\r\ncollege. Under the shadow of those hills I had first met the old doctor.\r\nI was only a boy then.\r\n\r\nI turned into the building. Even the sound of my footsteps was foreign;\r\nthe whole place was pregnant with stillness and shadow; life was gone\r\nout. It was fearful; I felt the terror clutching upon me, a grimness\r\nthat may not be spoken; there was something breaking within me. I had\r\npledged myself for a year. Frankly I was afraid.\r\n\r\nBut I had given my word. I returned to my apartments and began that\r\nvery day the closing down of my practice. In a fortnight I had completed\r\neverything and had moved my things to the room of Chick Watson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nALBERT JEROME\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as soon as possible I hurried over to Berkeley. I went straight to\r\nthe bungalow on Dwight Way; I inquired for Miss Holcomb. She was a woman\r\nnow in her late twenties, decidedly pretty, a blonde, and of intelligent\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nComing on such an errand, I was at a loss just how to approach her. I\r\nnoted the little lines about the corners of her eyes, the sad droop of\r\nher pretty mouth. Plainly she was worried. As I was removing my hat she\r\ncaught sight of the ring upon my finger.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said; “then you come from Mr. Watson. How is Chick?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Watson”--I did not like lying, but I could not but feel for\r\nher; she had already lost her father--“Mr. Watson has gone on a trip\r\nup-country--with Jerome. He was not feeling well. He has left this ring\r\nwith me. I have come for a bit of information.”\r\n\r\nShe bit her lips; her mouth quivered.\r\n\r\n“Couldn't you get this from Mr. Watson? He knows about the stone. Didn't\r\nhe tell you? How did it come into your possession? What has happened?”\r\n\r\nHer voice was querulous and suspicious. I had endeavoured to deceive her\r\nfor her own sake; she had suffered enough already. I could not but wince\r\nat the pain in her eyes. She stood up.\r\n\r\n“Please, Mr. Wendel; don't be clumsy. Don't regard me as a mere baby.\r\nTell me what has happened to Chick. Please--”\r\n\r\nShe stopped in a flow of emotion. Tears came to her eyes; but she held\r\ncontrol. She sat down.\r\n\r\n“Tell me all, Mr. Wendel. It is what I expected.” She blinked to hold\r\nback her tears. “It is my fault. You wouldn't have the ring had nothing\r\nhappened. Tell me. I can be brave.”\r\n\r\nAnd brave she was--splendid. With the tug at my own heart I could\r\nunderstand her. What uncertainty and dread she must have been under! I\r\nhad been in it but a few days; already I could feel the weight. At no\r\ntime could I surmount the isolation; there was something going from\r\nme minute by minute. With the girl there could be no evasion; it were\r\nbetter that she have the truth. I made a clean breast of the whole\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n“And he told you no more about the ring?”\r\n\r\n“That is all,” I answered. “He would have told us much more,\r\nundoubtedly, had he not--”\r\n\r\n“You saw him go--you saw this thing?”\r\n\r\n“That is just it, Miss Holcomb. We saw nothing. One minute we were\r\nlooking at Chick, and the next at nothing. Hobart understood it better\r\nthan I. At least he forbade my crossing the room. There is a danger\r\npoint, a spot that may not be crossed. He threw me back. It was then\r\nthat the Rhamda came upon the scene.” She frowned slightly.\r\n\r\n“Tell me about the Nervina. When Chick spoke of her, I could always feel\r\njealous. Is she beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Most beautiful, the most wonderful girl I have ever seen, though I\r\nwould hardly class her as one to be jealous of. But she wants the ring.\r\nI've promised Watson, and of course I shall keep it. But I would like\r\nits history.”\r\n\r\n“I think I can give you some information there,” she answered. “The\r\nring, or rather the jewel, was given to father about twenty years ago by\r\na Mr. Kennedy. He had been a pupil of father's when father taught at a\r\nlocal school. He came here often to talk over old times. Father had the\r\njewel set in a ring; but he never wore it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“How did Watson come to link it up with the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“That, I think, was an accident. He was in college, you know, at the\r\ntime of father's disappearance. In fact, he was in the Ethics class.\r\nHe came here often, and during one of his visits I showed him the ring.\r\nThat was several years ago.”\r\n\r\n“I see.”\r\n\r\n“Well, about a year ago he was here again, and asked to see the jewel.\r\nWe were to be married, you understand; but I had always put it off\r\nbecause of father. Somehow I felt that he would return. It was in late\r\nsummer, about September; it was in the evening; it was getting dark. I\r\ngave Chick the ring, and stepped into the garden to cut some flowers. I\r\nremember that Chick struck a match in the parlour. When I came back he\r\nseemed to be excited.”\r\n\r\n“Did he ask you for the ring?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. He wanted to wear it. And he suddenly began to talk of father. It\r\nwas that night that he took it upon himself to find him.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Not before that night? Did he take the ring then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. We went to the opera. I remember it well, because that night was\r\nthe first time I ever knew Chick to be gloomy.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You know how jolly he always was. When we returned that night he\r\nwould scarcely say a word. I thought he was sick; but he said he was\r\nnot; said he just felt that way.”\r\n\r\n“I understand. And he kept getting glummer? Did you suspect the jewel?\r\nDid he ever tell you anything?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No. He told me nothing, except that he would find father. Of course, I\r\nbecame excited and wanted to know. But he insisted that I couldn't help;\r\nthat he had a clue, and that it might take time. From that night I saw\r\nvery little of him. He leased the house on Chatterton Place. He seemed\r\nto lose interest in myself; when he did come over he would act queerly.\r\nHe talked incoherently, and would often make rambling mention of a\r\nbeautiful girl called Nervina. You say it is the ring? Tell me, Mr.\r\nWendel, what is it? Has it really anything to do with father?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“I think it has, Miss Holcomb. And I can understand poor Chick. He is a\r\nvery brave man. It's a strange jewel and of terrible potency; that much\r\nI know. It devitalises; it destroys. I can feel it already. It covers\r\nlife with a fog of decay. The same solitude has come upon myself.\r\nNevertheless I am certain it has much to do with the Blind Spot. It is a\r\nkey of some sort. The very interest of the Rhamda and the Nervina tells\r\nus that. I think it was through this stone that your father made his\r\ndiscovery.”\r\n\r\nShe thought a moment.\r\n\r\n“Hadn't you better return it? While you still have health? If you keep\r\nit, it will be only one more.”\r\n\r\n“You forget, Miss Holcomb, my promise to Chick. I loved your father,\r\nand I was fond of Watson. It's a great secret and, if the professor is\r\nright, one which man has sought through the ages. I'd be a coward to\r\nforgo my duty. If I fail, I have another to take my place.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “it's horrible. First father; then Chick; now you; and\r\nafterwards it will be Mr. Fenton.”\r\n\r\n“It is our duty,” I returned. “One by one. Though we may fail, each one\r\nof us may pass a bit more on to his successor. In the end we win. It is\r\nthe way of man.”\r\n\r\nI had my way. She turned over all the data and notes that had been\r\nleft by the professor; but I never found a thing in them that could be\r\nconstrued to an advantage. My real quest was to trace down the jewel.\r\nThe man Kennedy's full name was, I learned, Budge Kennedy. He had lived\r\nin Oakland. It was late in the afternoon when I parted with Miss Holcomb\r\nand started for the city.\r\n\r\nI remember it well because of a little incident that occurred\r\nimmediately after our parting. I was just going down the steps when I\r\nlooked up one of the side streets. A few students were loitering here\r\nand there. But there was one who was not a student. I recognised him\r\ninstantly, and I wondered. It was the Rhamda. This was enough to make\r\nme suspicious. But there was one thing more. Farther up the street was\r\nanother figure.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down the steps the Rhamda moved, and his move was somehow\r\nduplicated by the other. In itself this was enough to clear up some of\r\nmy doubts concerning the phantom. His actions were too simple for an\r\napparition. Only a man would act like that, and a crude one. I didn't\r\nknow then the nerve of the Rhamda. There was no doubt that I was being\r\nshadowed.\r\n\r\nTo make certain, I took the by-streets and meandered by a devious route\r\nto the station. There was no question; one and two they followed. I knew\r\nthe Rhamda; but who was the other?\r\n\r\nAt the station we purchased tickets, and when the train pulled in I\r\nboarded a smoker. The other two took another coach--the stranger was a\r\nthick-set individual with a stubby, grey moustache. On the boat I didn't\r\nsee them; but at the ferry building I made a test to see that I was\r\nfollowed. I hailed a taxi and gave specific instructions to the driver.\r\n\r\n“Drive slowly,” I told him. “I think we shall be followed.”\r\n\r\nAnd I was right; in a few minutes there were two cars dogging our\r\nwheel-tracks. I had no doubt concerning the Rhamda; but I couldn't\r\nunderstand the other. At No. 288 Chatterton Place we stopped and I\r\nalighted. The Rhamda's car passed, then the other. Neither stopped. Both\r\ndisappeared round the corner. I took the numbers; then I went into the\r\nhouse. In about a half hour a car drew up at the curb. I stepped to\r\nthe window. It was the car that had tracked the Rhamda's. The stubby\r\nindividual stepped out; without ceremony he ran up the steps and opened\r\nthe door. It was a bit disconcerting, I think, for both. He was plain\r\nand blunt--and honest.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “where's Watson? Who are you? What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“That,” I answered, “is a question for both of us. Who are you, and what\r\ndo you want? Where is Watson?”\r\n\r\nJust then his eyes dropped and his glance fell and eyes widened.\r\n\r\n“My name is Jerome,” he said simply. “Has something happened to Watson?\r\nWho are you?”\r\n\r\nWe were standing in the library; I made an indication towards the other\r\nroom. “In there,” I said. “My name is Wendel.”\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat and ran the back of his hand across his forehead.\r\n\r\n“So that pair got him, too! I was afraid of them all the while. And I\r\nhad to be away. Do you know how they did it? What's the working of their\r\ngame? It's devilish and certainly clever. They played that boy for a\r\nyear; they knew they would get him in the end. So did I.\r\n\r\n“He was a fine lad, a fine lad. I knew this morning when I came down\r\nfrom Nevada that they had him. Found your duds. A stranger. House looked\r\nqueer. But I had hopes he might have gone over to see his girl. Just\r\nthought I'd wander over to Berkeley. Found that bird Rhamda under a palm\r\ntree watching the Holcomb bungalow. It was the first time I'd seen\r\nhim since that day things went amiss with the professor. In about ten\r\nminutes you came out. I stayed with him while he tracked you back here;\r\nI followed him back down town and lost him. Tell me about Watson.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down; during my recital he spoke not a word. He consumed one\r\ncigar after another; when I stopped for a moment he merely nodded his\r\nhead and waited until I continued. He was sturdy and frank, of an iron\r\nway and vast common sense. I liked him. When I had finished he remained\r\nsilent; his grief was of a solid kind! he had liked poor Watson.\r\n\r\n“I see,” he said. “It is as I thought. He told you more than he ever\r\ntold me.”\r\n\r\n“He never told you?”\r\n\r\n“Not much. He was a strange lad--about the loneliest one I've ever seen.\r\nThere was something about him from the very first that was not natural;\r\nI couldn't make him out. You say it is the ring. He always wore it.\r\nI laid it to this Rhamda. He was always meeting him. I could never\r\nunderstand it. Try as I would, I could not get a trace of the phantom.”\r\n\r\n“The phantom?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly. Would you call him human?” His grey eyes were flecked\r\nwith light. “Come now, Mr. Wendel, would you?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I answered, “I don't know. Not after what I have seen. But for\r\nall that, I have proof of his sinews. I am inclined to blend the\r\ntwo. There is a law somewhere, a very natural one. The Blind Spot is\r\nundoubtedly a combination of phenomena; it has a control. We do not know\r\nwhat it is, or where it leads to; neither do we know the motive of the\r\nRhamda. Who is he? If we knew that, we would know everything.”\r\n\r\n“And this ring?”\r\n\r\n“I shall wear it.”\r\n\r\n“Then God help you. I watched Watson. It's plain poison. You have a\r\nyear; but you had better count on half a year; the first six months\r\naren't so bad; but the last--it takes a man! Wendel, it takes a man!\r\nAlready you're eating your heart out. Oh, I know--you have opened the\r\nwindows; you want sunshine and air. In six months I shall have to fight\r\nto get one open. It gets into the soul; it is stagnation; you die by\r\ninches. Better give me the ring.”\r\n\r\n“This Budge Kennedy,” I evaded, “we must find him. We have time. One\r\nclue may lead us on. Tell me what you know of the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“Very easy,” he answered; “you have it all. I have been here a number of\r\nyears. You will remember I fell into the case through intuition. I never\r\nhad any definite proof, outside the professor's disappearance, the\r\nold lady, and that bell; unless perhaps it is the Rhamda. But from the\r\nbeginning I've been positive.\r\n\r\n“Taking that lecture in ethics as a starter, I built up my theory.\r\nAll the clues lead to this building. It's something that I cannot\r\nunderstand. It's out of the occult. It's a bit too much for me. I moved\r\ninto the place and waited. I've never forgotten that bell, nor that old\r\nlady. You and Fenton are the only ones who have seen the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\nI had a sudden thought.\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda! I have read that he has the manner of inherent goodness. Is\r\nit true? You have conversed with him. I haven't.”\r\n\r\n“He has. He didn't strike me as a villain. He's intrinsic, noble, out of\r\nself. I have often wondered.”\r\n\r\nI smiled. “Perhaps we are thinking the same thing. Is this it? The Blind\r\nSpot is a secret that man may not attain to. It is unknowable and akin\r\nto death. The Rhamda knows it. He couldn't head off the professor. He\r\nsimply employed Dr. Holcomb's wisdom to trap him; now that he has him\r\nsecure, he intends to hold him. It is for our own good.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Yet--”\r\n\r\n“Yet?”\r\n\r\n“He was very anxious to put you and Fenton into this very Spot.”\r\n\r\n“That is so. But may it not be that we, too, knew a bit too much?”\r\n\r\nHe couldn't answer that.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we were both of us convinced concerning the Rhamda. It was\r\nmerely a digression of thought, a conjecture. He might be good; but we\r\nwere both positive of his villainy. It was his motive, of course,\r\nthat weighed up his character; could we find that, we would uncover\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nA NEW ELEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nBudge Kennedy was not so easily found. There were many Kennedys. About\r\ntwo-thirds of Ireland had apparently migrated to San Francisco under\r\nthat name and had lodged in the directory. We went through the lists on\r\nboth sides of the bay, but found nothing; the old directories had mostly\r\nbeen destroyed by fire or had been thrown away as worthless; but at last\r\nwe unearthed one. In it we found the name of Budge Kennedy.\r\n\r\nHe had two sons--Patrick and Henry. One of these, Henry, we ran down in\r\nthe Mission. He was a great, red-headed, broad-shouldered Irishman. He\r\nwas just eating supper when we called; there were splotches of white\r\nplaster on his trousers.\r\n\r\nI came right to the point: “Do you know anything about this?” I held out\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\nHe took it in his fingers; his eyes popped. “What, that! Well, I guess\r\nI do! Where'd you get it?” He called out to the kitchen: “Say, Mollie,\r\ncome here. Here's the old man's jool!” He looked at me a bit fearfully.\r\n“You aren't wearing it?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Why? Well, I don't know exactly. I wouldn't wear it for a million\r\ndollars. It ain't a jool; it's a piece of the divil. The old man gave\r\nit to Dr. Holcomb--or sold it, I don't know which. He carried it in his\r\npocket once, and he came near dying.”\r\n\r\n“Unlucky?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, it ain't unlucky; it just rips your heart out. It would make you\r\nhate your grandmother. Lonesome! Lonesome! I've often heard the old man\r\ntalking.”\r\n\r\n“He sold it to Dr. Holcomb? Do you know why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes. 'Twas that the old doc had some scientific work. Dad told\r\nhim about his jool. One day he took it over to Berkeley. It was some\r\nkind of thing that the professor just wanted. He kept it. Dad made him\r\npromise not to wear it.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Did your father ever tell you where he got it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. He often spoke about that. The old man wasn't a plasterer,\r\nyou know--just a labourer. He was digging a basement. It was a funny\r\nbasement--a sort of blind cellar. There was a stone wall right across\r\nthe middle, and then there was a door of wood to look like stone. You\r\ncan go down into the back cellar, but not into the front. If you don't\r\nknow about the door, you'll never find it. Dad often spoke about that.\r\nHe was working in the back cellar when he found this. 'Twas sticking in\r\nsome blue clay.”\r\n\r\n“Where was this place? Do you remember?”\r\n\r\n“Sure. 'Twas in Chatterton Place. Pat and I was kids then; we took the\r\nold man's dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the number?”\r\n\r\n“It didn't have no number; but I know the place. 'Tis a two-story house,\r\nand was built in 'ninety-one.”\r\n\r\nI nodded. “And afterwards you moved to Oakland?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Did your father ever speak of the reason for this partition in the\r\ncellar?”\r\n\r\n“He never knew of one. It was none of his business. He was merely a\r\nlabourer, and did what he was paid for.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know who built it?”\r\n\r\n“Some old guy. He was a cranky cuss with side-whiskers. He used to wear\r\na stove-pipe hat. I think he was a chemist. Whenever he showed up he\r\nwould run us kids out of the building. I think he was a bachelor.”\r\n\r\nThis was all the information he could give, but it was a great deal.\r\nCertainly it was more than I had hoped for. The house had been built\r\nby a chemist; even in the construction there was mystery. I had never\r\nthought of a second cellar; when I had explored the building I had taken\r\nthe stone wall for granted. It was so with Jerome. It was the first\r\ndefinite clue that really brought us down to earth. What had this\r\nchemist to do with the phenomena?\r\n\r\nAfter all, behind everything was lurking the mind of man.\r\n\r\nWe hastened back to the house and into the cellar. By merely sounding\r\nalong the wall we discovered the door; it was cleverly constructed and\r\nfor a time defied our efforts; but Jerome got it open by means of a\r\njemmy and a pick. The outside was a clever piece of sham work shaped\r\nlike stone and smeared over with cement. In the dim light we had missed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe had high expectations. But we were disappointed. The space contained\r\nnothing; it was smeared with cobwebs and hairy mould; but outside of a\r\nfew empty bottles and the gloomy darkness there was nothing. We tapped\r\nthe walls and floor and ceiling. Beyond all doubt the place once held\r\na secret; if it held it still, it was cleverly hidden. After an hour or\r\ntwo of search we returned to the upper part of the building.\r\n\r\nJerome was not discouraged.\r\n\r\n“We're on the right track, Mr. Wendel; if we can only get started.\r\nI have an idea. The chemist--it was in 'ninety-one--that's more than\r\ntwenty years.”\r\n\r\n“What is your idea?”\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda. What is the first thing that strikes you? His age. With\r\neveryone that sees him it's the same. At first you take him for an old\r\nman; if you study him long enough, you are positive that he is in his\r\ntwenties. May he not be this chemist?”\r\n\r\n“What becomes of the doctor and his Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“The Blind Spot,” answered Jerome, “is merely a part of the chemistry.”\r\n\r\nNext day I hunted up a jeweller. I was careful to choose one with whom I\r\nwas acquainted. I asked for a private consultation. When we were alone I\r\ntook the ring from my finger.\r\n\r\n“Just an opinion,” I asked. “You know gems. Can you tell me anything\r\nabout this one?”\r\n\r\nHe picked it up casually, and turned it over; his mouth puckered. For a\r\nminute he studied.\r\n\r\n“That? Well, now.” He held it up. “Humph. Wait a minute.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a gem?”\r\n\r\n“I think it is. At first I thought I knew it right off; but now--wait a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nHe reached in the drawer for his glass. He held the stone up for some\r\nminutes. His face was a study; queer little wrinkles twisting from the\r\ncorners of his eyes told his wonder. He did not speak; merely turned\r\nthe stone round and round. At last he removed his glass and held up the\r\nring. He was quizzical.\r\n\r\n“Where did you get this?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“That is something I do not care to answer. I wish to know what it is.\r\nIs it a gem? If so, what kind?”\r\n\r\nHe thought a moment and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“I thought I knew every gem on earth. But I don't. This is a new one.\r\nIt is beautiful--just a moment.” He stepped to the door. In a moment\r\nanother man stepped in. The jeweller motioned towards the ring. The man\r\npicked it up and again came the examination. At last he laid the glass\r\nand ring both upon the table.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it, Henry?” asked the jeweller.\r\n\r\n“Not me,” answered the second one. “I never saw one like it.”\r\n\r\nIt was as Watson had said. No man had ever identified the jewel. The two\r\nmen were puzzled; they were interested. The jeweller turned to me.\r\n\r\n“Would you care to leave it with us for a bit; you have no objection to\r\nus taking it out of the ring?”\r\n\r\nI had not thought of that. I had business down the street. I consulted\r\nmy watch.\r\n\r\n“In half an hour I shall be back. Will that be enough time?”\r\n\r\n“I think so.”\r\n\r\nIt was an hour before I returned. The assistant was standing at the door\r\nof the office. He spoke something to the one inside and then made an\r\nindication to myself. He seemed excited; when I came closer I noted that\r\nhis face was full of wonder.\r\n\r\n“We've been waiting,” said he. “We didn't examine the stone; it wasn't\r\nnecessary. It is truly wonderful.” He was a short, squat man with a\r\nmassive forehead. “Just step inside.”\r\n\r\nInside the office the jeweller was sitting beside a table; he was\r\nleaning back in his chair; he had his hands clasped over his stomach. He\r\nwas gazing toward the ceiling; his face was a study, full of wonder and\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n“Well?” I asked.\r\n\r\nFor an answer he merely raised his finger, pointed towards the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“Up there,” he spoke. “Your jewel or whatever it is. A good thing we\r\nweren't in open air. 'Twould be going yet.”\r\n\r\nI looked up. Sure enough, against the ceiling was the gem. It was a bit\r\ndisconcerting, though I will confess that in the first moment I did not\r\ncatch the full significance.\r\n\r\nThe jeweller closed one eye and studied first myself and then the\r\nbeautiful thing against the ceiling.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of it?” he asked.\r\n\r\nReally I had not made anything; it was a bit of a shock; I hadn't\r\ngrasped the full impossibility. I didn't answer.\r\n\r\n“Don't you see, Mr. Wendel? Impossible! Contrary to nature! Lighter than\r\nair. We took it out of the ring and it shot out like a bullet. Thought\r\nI'd dropped it. Began looking on the floor. Couldn't find it; looked up\r\nand saw Reynolds, here, with his eyes popping out like marbles. He was\r\nlooking at the ceiling.”\r\n\r\nI thought for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Then it is not a gem?”\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Not if I'm a jeweller. Whoever heard of a\r\nstone without weight? It has no gravity, that is, apparently. I doubt\r\nwhether it is a substance. I don't know what it is.”\r\n\r\nIt was puzzling. I would have given a good deal just then for a few\r\nwords with Dr. Holcomb. The man, Kennedy, had kept it in his pocket.\r\nHow had he held it a prisoner? The professor had use for it in some\r\nscientific work! No wonder! Certainly it was not a jewel. What could it\r\nbe? It was solid. It was lighter than air. Could it be a substance? If\r\nnot; what is it?\r\n\r\n“What would you advise?”\r\n\r\nIn answer the jeweller reached for the telephone. He gave a number.\r\n\r\n“Hello. Say, is Ed there? This is Phil. Tell him to step to the phone.\r\nHello! Say, Ed, I want you to come over on the jump. Something to show\r\nyou. Too busy! No, you're not. Not for this. I'm going to teach you some\r\nchemistry. No; this is serious. What is it? I don't know. What's lighter\r\nthan air? Lots of things? Oh, I know. But what solid? That's why I'm\r\nasking. Come over. All right. At once.”\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\n“My brother,” he spoke. “It has passed beyond my province and into his.\r\nHe is a chemist. As an expert he may give you a real opinion.”\r\n\r\nSurely we needed one. It was against reason. It had taken me\r\ncompletely off my balance. I took a chair and joined the others in the\r\ncontemplation of the blue dot on the ceiling. We could speculate and\r\nconjecture; but there was not one of us deep enough even to start a\r\ntheory. Plainly it was what should not be. We had been taught physics\r\nand science; we had been drilled to fundamentals. If this thing could\r\nbe, then the foundations upon which we stood were shattered. But one\r\nlittle law! Back in my mind was buzzing the enigma of the Blind Spot.\r\nThey were woven together. Some law that had eluded the ken of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe chemist was a tall man with a hook nose and black eyes that clinched\r\nlike rivets. He was a bit impatient. He looked keenly at his brother.\r\n\r\n“Well, Phil, what is it?” He pulled out a watch, “I haven't much time.”\r\n\r\nThere was a contrast between them. The jeweller was fat and complacent.\r\nHe merely sat in his chair, his hand on his waistband and a stubby\r\nfinger elevated toward the jewel. He seemed to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n“You're a chemist, Ed. Here's a test for your wisdom. Can you explain\r\nthat? No, over here. Above your head. That jewel?”\r\n\r\nThe other looked up.\r\n\r\n“What's the idea? New notion for decoration? Or”?--a bit testily--“is\r\nthis a joke?” He was a serious man; his black eyes and the nose spoke\r\nhis character.\r\n\r\nThe jeweller laughed gently.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Ed--” Then he went into explanation; when he was through the\r\nchemist was twitching with excitement.\r\n\r\n“Get me a ladder. Here, let me get on the table; perhaps I can reach\r\nit. Sounds impossible, but if it's so, it's so; it must have an\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\nWithout ado and in spite of the protests of his brother he stepped upon\r\nthe polished surface of the table. He was a tall man; he could just\r\nbarely reach it with the tip of his finger. He could move it; but each\r\ntime it clung as to a magnet. After a minute of effort he gave it up.\r\nWhen he looked down he was a different man; his black eyes glowed with\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n“Can't make it,” he said. “Get a step-ladder. Strange!”\r\n\r\nWith the ladder it was easy. He plucked it off the ceiling. We pressed\r\nabout the table. The chemist turned it about with his fingers.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” he was saying. “It's a gem. Apparently. You say it has no\r\ngravity. It can't be. Whoop!” He let it slip out of his fingers. Again\r\nit popped on its way to the ceiling. He caught it with a deft movement\r\nof his hand. “The devil! Did you ever see! And a solid! Who owns this?”\r\n\r\nThat brought it back to me. I explained what I could of the manner of my\r\npossession.\r\n\r\n“I see. Very interesting. Something I've never\r\nseen--and--frankly--something strictly against what I've been taught.\r\nNevertheless, it's not impossible. We are witnesses at least. Would you\r\ncare if I take this over to the laboratory?”\r\n\r\nIt was a new complication. If it were not a jewel there was a chance of\r\nits being damaged. I was as anxious as he; but I had been warned as to\r\nits possession.\r\n\r\n“I shan't harm it. I'll see to that. I have suspicions and I'd like to\r\nverify them. A chemist doesn't blunder across such a thing every day. I\r\nam a chemist.” His eyes glistened.\r\n\r\n“Your suspicions?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“A new element.”\r\n\r\nThis gem. A new element. Perhaps that would explain the Blind Spot. It\r\nwas not exactly of earth. Everything had confirmed it.\r\n\r\n“You--A new element? How do you account for it? It defies your laws.\r\nMost of your elements are evolved through tedious process. This is\r\npicked up by chance.”\r\n\r\n“That is so. But there are still a thousand ways. A meteor, perhaps; a\r\nbit of cosmic dust--there are many shattered comets. Our chemistry\r\nis earthly. There are undoubtedly new elements that we don't know of.\r\nPerhaps in enormous proportion.”\r\n\r\nI let him have it. It was the only night I had been away from the ring.\r\nI may say that it is the only time I have been free from its isolation.\r\n\r\nWhen I called at his office next day I found he had merely confirmed his\r\nsuspicions. It defied analysis; there was no reaction. Under all tests\r\nit was a stranger. The whole science that had been built up to explain\r\neverything had here explained nothing. However there was one thing that\r\nhe had uncovered--heat. Perhaps I should say magnetism. It was cold to\r\nman. I have spoken about the icy blue of its colour. It was cold even to\r\nlook at. The chemist placed it in my hand.\r\n\r\n“Is it not so?”\r\n\r\nIt was. The minute it touched my palm I could sense the weird horror of\r\nthe isolation; the stone was cold. Just like a piece of ice.\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I had ever had it in direct contact with the\r\nflesh. Set in the ring its impulse had always been secondary.\r\n\r\n“You notice it? It is so with me. Now then. Just a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed a button. A young lady answered his ring; she glanced first\r\nat myself and then at the chemist.\r\n\r\n“Miss Mills, this is Mr. Wendel. He is the owner of the gem. Would you\r\ntake it in your hand? And please tell Mr. Wendel how it feels--”\r\n\r\nShe laughed; she was a bit perplexed.\r\n\r\n“I don't understand”--she turned to me--“we had the same dispute\r\nyesterday. See, Mr. White says that it's cold; but it is not. It is\r\nwarm; almost burning. All the other girls think just as I do.”\r\n\r\n“And all the men as I do,” averred the chemist, “even Mr. Wendel.”\r\n\r\n“Is it cold to you?” she asked. “Really--”\r\n\r\nIt was a turn I hadn't looked for. It was akin to life--this relation to\r\nsex. Could it account for the strange isolation and the weariness? I was\r\na witness to its potency. Watson! I could feel myself dragging under. I\r\nhad just one question:\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Miss Mills. Can you sense anything else; I mean beyond its\r\ntemperature?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled a bit. “I don't know what you mean exactly. It is a beautiful\r\nstone. I would like to have it.”\r\n\r\n“You think its possession would make you happy?”\r\n\r\nHer eyes sparkled.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she exclaimed. “I know it would! I can feel it!”\r\n\r\nIt was so. Whatever there was in the bit of sapphirine blue, it had\r\nlife. What was it? It had relation to sex. In the strict line of fact it\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen we were alone again I turned to the chemist.\r\n\r\n“Is there anything more you uncovered? Did you see anything in the\r\nstone?”\r\n\r\nHe frowned. “No. Nothing else. This magnetism is the only thing. Is\r\nthere anything more?”\r\n\r\nNow I hadn't said anything about its one great quality. He hadn't\r\nstumbled across the image of the two men. I couldn't understand it. I\r\ndidn't tell him. Perhaps I was wrong. Down inside me I sensed a subtle\r\nreason for secrecy. It is hard to explain. It was not perverseness; it\r\nwas a finer distinction; perhaps it was the influence of the gem. I took\r\nit back to the jeweller again and had it reset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nAGAIN THE NERVINA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that I began taking notes. There is something\r\npsychological to the Blind Spot, weird and touching on the spirit. I\r\nknow not what it is; but I can feel it. It impinges on to life. I can\r\nsense the ecstasy of horror. I am not afraid. Whatever it is that is\r\ndragging me down, it is not evil. My sensations are not normal.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of my successor, if there is to be one, I have made an\r\nelaborate detail of notes and comments. After all, the whole thing,\r\nwhen brought down to the end, must fall to the function of science.\r\nWhen Hobart arrives, whatever my fate, he will find a complete and\r\ncomprehensive record of my sensations. I shall keep it up to the end.\r\nSuch notes being dry and sometimes confusing I have purposely omitted\r\nthem from this narrative. But there are some things that must be\r\ngiven to the world. I shall pick out the salient parts and give them\r\nchronologically.\r\n\r\nJerome stayed with me. Rather I should say he spent the nights with me.\r\nMost of the time he was on the elusive trail of the Rhamda. From the\r\nminute of our conversation with Kennedy he held to one conviction. He\r\nwas positive of that chemist back in the nineties. He was certain of\r\nthe Rhamda. Whatever the weirdness of his theory it would certainly bear\r\ninvestigation. When he was not on the trail over the city he was at work\r\nin the cellar. Here we worked together.\r\n\r\nWe dug up the concrete floor and did a bit of mining. I was interested\r\nin the formation.\r\n\r\nFrom the words of Budge Kennedy the bit of jewel had been discovered at\r\nthe original excavation. We found the blue clay that he spoke of, but\r\nnothing else. Jerome dissected every bit of earth carefully. We have\r\nspent many hours in that cellar.\r\n\r\nBut most of the time I was alone. When not too worn with the loneliness\r\nand weariness I worked at my notes. It has been a hard task from the\r\nbeginning. Inertia, lack of energy! How much of our life is impulse!\r\nWhat is the secret that backs volition? It has been will--will-power\r\nfrom the beginning. I must thank my ancestors. Without the strength and\r\ncharacter built up through generations, I would have succumbed utterly.\r\n\r\nEven as it is I sometimes think I am wrong in following the dictates of\r\nWatson. If I were only sure. I have pledged my word and my honour. What\r\ndid he know? I need all the reserve of character to hold up against\r\nthe Nervina. From the beginning she has been my opponent. What is her\r\ninterest in the Blind Spot and myself? Who is she? I cannot think of\r\nher as evil. She is too beautiful, too tender; her concern is so real.\r\nSometimes I think of her as my protector, that it is she, and she alone\r\nwho holds back the power which would engulf me. Once she made a personal\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nJerome had gone. I was alone. I had dragged myself to the desk and my\r\nnotes and data. It was along toward spring and in the first shadows of\r\nthe early evening. I had turned on the lights. It was the first labour\r\nI had done for several days. I had a great deal of work before me. I\r\nhad begun sometime before to take down my temperature. I was careful of\r\neverything now, as much as I could be under the depression. So far I had\r\ndiscerned nothing that could be classed as pathological.\r\n\r\nThere is something subtle about the Nervina. She is much like the\r\nRhamda. Perhaps they are the same. I hear no sound, I have no notion of\r\na door or entrance. Watson had said of the Rhamda, “Sometimes you see\r\nhim, sometimes you don't.” It is so with the Nervina. I remember only\r\nmy working at the data and the sudden movement of a hand upon my desk--a\r\ngirl's hand. It was bewildering. I looked up.\r\n\r\nI had not seen her since that night. It was now eight months--did I not\r\nknow, I would have recorded them as years. Her expression was a bit more\r\nsad--and beautiful. The same wonderful glow of her eyes, night-black and\r\ntender; the softness that comes from passion, and love, and virtue. The\r\nsame wistful droop of the perfect mouth. What a wondrous mass of hair\r\nshe had! I dropped my pen. She took my hand. I could sense the thrill of\r\ncontact; cool and magnetic.\r\n\r\n“Harry!”\r\n\r\nShe said no more; I did not answer; I was too taken by surprise and\r\nwonder. I could feel her concern as I would a mother's. What was her\r\ninterest in myself? The contact of her hand sent a strange pulse through\r\nmy vitals; she was so beautiful. Could it be? Watson said he loved her.\r\nCould I blame him?\r\n\r\n“Harry,” she asked, “how long is it to continue?”\r\n\r\nSo that was it. Merely an envoy to accept surrender. I was worn utterly,\r\nweary of the world, lonely. But I hadn't given up. I had strength still,\r\nand will enough to hold out to the end. Perhaps I was wrong. If I gave\r\nher the ring? what then?\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” I answered, “that I must go on. I have given my word. It\r\nhas been much harder than I expected. This jewel? What has it to do with\r\nthe Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“It controls it.”\r\n\r\n“Does the Rhamda desire it?”\r\n\r\n“He does.”\r\n\r\n“Why doesn't he call for it personally? Why doesn't he make a clean\r\nbreast of it? It would be much easier. He knows and you know that I am\r\nafter Dr. Holcomb and Watson. I might even forego the secret. Would he\r\nrelease the doctor?”\r\n\r\n“No, Harry, he would not.”\r\n\r\n“I see. If I gave up the ring it would be merely for my personal safety.\r\nI am a coward--”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “don't say that. You must give the ring to me--not to\r\nthe Rhamda. He must not control the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n“What is the Blind Spot? Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Harry,” she spoke, “I cannot. It is not for you or any other mortal. It\r\nis a secret that should never have been uncovered. It might be the end.\r\nIn the hands of the Rhamda it would certainly be the end of mankind.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the Rhamda? Who are you? You are too beautiful to be merely\r\nwoman. Are you a spirit?”\r\n\r\nShe pressed my hand ever so slightly. “Do I feel like a spirit? I am\r\nmaterial as much as you are. We live, see--everything.”\r\n\r\n“But you are not of this world?”\r\n\r\nHer eyes grew sadder; a soft longing.\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, Harry, not exactly. It is a long story and a very strange\r\none. I may not tell you. It is for your own good. I am your friend”--her\r\neyes were moist--“I--don't you see? Oh, I would save you!”\r\n\r\nI did not doubt it. Somehow she was like a girl of dreams, pure as an\r\nangel; her wistfulness only deepened her beauty. It came like a shock\r\nat the moment. I could love this woman. She was--what was I thinking?\r\nMy guilty mind ran back to Charlotte. I had loved her since boyhood. I\r\nwould be a coward--then a wild fear. Perhaps of jealousy.\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda? Is he your husband? You are the same--”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she answered, “why do you say it?” Her eyes snapped and she grew\r\nrigid. “The Rhamda! My husband! If you only knew. I hate him! We are\r\nenemies. It was he who opened the Blind Spot. I am here because he is\r\nevil. To watch him. I love your world, I love it all. I would save it. I\r\nlove--”\r\n\r\nShe dropped her head. Whatever she was, she was not above sobbing.\r\n\r\nI touched her hair; it was of the softest texture I have ever seen;\r\nthe lustre was like all the beauty of night woven into silk. She loved,\r\nloved; I could love--I was on the point of surrender.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” I asked, “just one thing more. If I gave you this ring would\r\nyou save the doctor and Chick Watson?”\r\n\r\nShe raised her head; her eyes glistened; but she did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Would you?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “I cannot,” she answered. “That cannot be. I can\r\nonly save you for--for--Charlotte.”\r\n\r\nWas it vanity in myself? I don't know. It seemed to me that it was hard\r\nfor her to say it. Frankly, I loved her. I knew it. I loved Charlotte. I\r\nloved them both. But I held to my purpose.\r\n\r\n“Are the professor and Watson living?”\r\n\r\n“They are.”\r\n\r\n“Are they conscious?”\r\n\r\nShe nodded. “Harry,” she said, “I can tell you that. They are living and\r\nconscious. You have seen them. They have only one enemy--the Rhamda.\r\nBut they must never come out of the Blind Spot. I am their friend and\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nA sudden courage came upon me. I remembered my word to Watson. I had\r\nloved the old professor. I would save them. If necessary I would follow\r\nto the end. Either myself or Fenton. One of us would solve it!\r\n\r\n“I shall keep the ring,” I said. “I shall avenge them. Somehow,\r\nsomewhere, I feel that I shall do it. Even if I must follow--”\r\n\r\nShe straightened at that. Her eyes were frightened.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “why do you say it? It must not be! You would perish!\r\nYou shall not do it! I must save you. You must not go alone. Three--it\r\nmay not be. If you go, I go with you. Perhaps--oh, Harry!”\r\n\r\nShe dropped her head again; her body shook with her sobbing; plainly\r\nshe was a girl. No real man is ever himself in the presence of a woman's\r\ntears. I was again on the point of surrender. Suddenly she looked up.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” she spoke sadly, “I have just one thing to ask. You must see\r\nCharlotte. You must forget me; we can never--you love Charlotte. I have\r\nseen her; she's a beautiful girl. You haven't written. She is worried.\r\nRemember what you mean to her happiness. Will you go?”\r\n\r\nThat I could promise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I shall see Charlotte.”\r\n\r\nShe rose from her chair. I held her hand. Again, as in the restaurant, I\r\nlifted it to my lips. She flushed and drew it away. She bit her lip. Her\r\nbeauty was a kind I could not understand.\r\n\r\n“You must see Charlotte,” she said, “and you must do as she says.”\r\n\r\nWith that she was gone. There was a car waiting; the last I saw was its\r\nwinking tail-light dimming into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft alone, I began thinking of Charlotte. I loved her; of that I was\r\ncertain. I could not compare her with the Nervina. She was like myself,\r\nhuman. I had known her since boyhood. The other was out of the ether; my\r\nlove for her was something different; she was of dreams and moonbeams;\r\nthere was a film about her beauty, illusion; she was of spirit.\r\n\r\nI wrote a note to the detective and left it upon my desk. After that I\r\npacked a suitcase and hurried to the station. If I was going I would do\r\nit at once, I could not trust myself too far. This visit had been like\r\na breath of air; for the moment I was away from the isolation. The\r\nloneliness and the weariness! How I dreaded it! I was only free from\r\nit for a few moments. On the train it came back upon me and in a manner\r\nthat was startling.\r\n\r\nI had purchased my ticket. When the conductor came through he passed me.\r\nHe gathered tickets all about me; but he did not notice me. At first I\r\npaid no attention; but when he had gone through the car several times I\r\nheld up my ticket. He did not stop. It was not until I had touched him\r\nthat he gave me a bit of attention.\r\n\r\n“Where have you been sitting?” he asked.\r\n\r\nI pointed to the seat. He frowned slightly.\r\n\r\n“There?” he asked. “Did you say you were sitting in that seat? Where did\r\nyou get on?”\r\n\r\n“At Townsend.”\r\n\r\n“Queer,” he answered; he punched the ticket. “Queer. I passed that seat\r\nseveral times. It was empty!”\r\n\r\nEmpty! It was almost a shock. Could it be that my isolation was becoming\r\nphysical as well as mental? What was this gulf that was widening between\r\nmyself and my fellows?\r\n\r\nIt was the beginning of another phase. I have noticed it many times; on\r\nthe street, in public places, everywhere. I thread in and out among men.\r\nSometimes they see me, sometimes they don't. It is strange. I feel at\r\ntimes as though I might be vanishing out of the world!\r\n\r\nIt was late when I reached my old home; but the lights were still\r\nburning. My favourite dog, Queen, was on the veranda. As I came up the\r\nsteps she growled slightly, but on recognition went into a series of\r\ncircles about the porch. My father opened the door. I stepped inside. He\r\ntouched me on the shoulder, his jaw dropped.\r\n\r\n“Harry!” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nWas it as bad as that? How much meaning may be placed in a single\r\nintonation! I was weary to the point of exhaustion. The ride upon the\r\ntrain had been too much.\r\n\r\nMy mother came in. For some moments I was busy protesting my health.\r\nBut it was useless; it wasn't until I had partaken of a few of the old\r\nnostrums that I could placate her.\r\n\r\n“Work, work, work, my boy,” said my father, “nothing but work. It\r\nreally won't do. You're a shadow. You must take a vacation. Go to the\r\nmountains; forget your practice for a short time.”\r\n\r\nI didn't tell them. Why should I? I decided right then it was my own\r\nbattle. It was enough for me without casting the worry upon others. Yet\r\nI could not see Charlotte without calling on my parents.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible I crossed the street to the Fentons'. Someone had\r\nseen me in town. Charlotte was waiting. She was the same beautiful girl\r\nI had known so long; the blue eyes, the blonde, wavy mass of hair, the\r\nlaughing mouth and the gladness. But she was not glad now. It was\r\nalmost a repetition of what had happened at home, only here a bit more\r\npersonal. She clung to me almost in terror. I didn't realise I had gone\r\ndown so much. I knew my weariness; but I hadn't thought my appearance\r\nso dejected. I remembered Watson. He had been wan, pale, forlorn.\r\nAfter what brief explanation I could give, I proposed a stroll in the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nIt was a full moon; a wonderful night; we walked down the avenue under\r\nthe elm trees. Charlotte was beautiful, and worried; she clung to my\r\narm with the eagerness of possession. I could not but compare her\r\nwith Nervina. There was a contrast; Charlotte was fresh, tender,\r\naffectionate, the girl of my boyhood. I had known her all my life; there\r\nwas no doubt of our love.\r\n\r\nWho was the other? She was something higher, out of mystery, out of\r\nlife--almost--out of the moonbeams. I stopped and looked up. The great\r\nfull orb was shining. I didn't know that I spoke.\r\n\r\n“Harry,” asked Charlotte, “who is the Nervina?”\r\n\r\nHad I spoken?\r\n\r\n“What do you know about the Nervina?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“She has been to see me. She told me. She said you would be here\r\ntonight. I was waiting. She is very beautiful. I never saw anyone like\r\nher. She is wonderful!”\r\n\r\n“What did she say?”\r\n\r\n“She! Oh, Harry. Tell me. I have waited. Something has happened. Tell\r\nme. You have told me nothing. You are not like the old Harry.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about the Nervina. What did she say? Charlotte, tell me\r\neverything. Am I so much different from the old Harry?”\r\n\r\nShe clutched at my arm fearfully; she looked into my eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, “how can you say it? You haven't laughed once. You are\r\nmelancholy; you are pale, drawn, haggard. You keep muttering. You are\r\nnot the old Harry. Is it this Nervina? At first I thought she loved you;\r\nbut she does not. She wanted to know all about you, and about our love.\r\nShe was so interested. What is this danger?”\r\n\r\nI didn't answer.\r\n\r\n“You must tell me. This ring? She said that you must give it to me. What\r\nis it?” she insisted.\r\n\r\n“Did she ask that? She told you to take the ring? My dear,” I asked, “if\r\nit were the ring and it were so sinister would I be a man to give it to\r\nmy loved one?”\r\n\r\n“It would not hurt me.”\r\n\r\nBut I would not. Something warned me. It was a ruse to get it out of my\r\npossession. The whole thing was haunting, weird, ghostly. Always I could\r\nhear Watson. I still had a small quota of courage and will-power. I\r\nclung steadfastly to my purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad three hours. Poor Charlotte! I shall never forget it. It is\r\nthe hardest task on earth to deny one's loved one.\r\n\r\nShe had grown into my heart and into its possession. She clung to me\r\ntenderly, tearfully. I could not tell her. Her feminine instinct sensed\r\ndisaster. In spite of her tears I insisted. When I kissed her goodnight\r\nshe did not speak. But she looked up at me through her tears. It was the\r\nhardest thing of all for me to bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE SHEPHERD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the city next morning I took my dog. It was a strange\r\nwhim; but one which was to lead to a remarkable development. I have\r\nalways been a lover of dogs. I was lonely. There is a bond between a dog\r\nand his master. It goes beyond definition; it roots down into nature. I\r\nwas to learn much.\r\n\r\nShe was an Australian shepherd. She was of a tawny black and bob-tailed\r\nfrom birth.\r\n\r\nWhat is the power that lies behind instinct? How far does it go? I had\r\na notion that the dog would be outside the sinister clutch that was\r\ndragging me under.\r\n\r\nHappily Jerome was fond of dogs. He was reading. When I entered with\r\nQueen tugging at the chain he looked up. The dog recognised the heart\r\nof the man; when he stooped to pet her she moved her stub tail in an\r\neffusion of affectionate acceptance. Jerome had been reading Le Bon's\r\ntheory on the evolution of force. His researches after the mystery had\r\nled him into the depths of speculation; he had become quite a scholar.\r\nAfter our first greeting I unhooked the chain and let Queen have the\r\nfreedom of the house. I related what had happened. The detective closed\r\nthe book and sat down. The dog waited a bit for further petting; but\r\nmissing that she began sniffing about the room. There was nothing\r\nstrange about it of course. I myself paid not the slightest attention.\r\nBut the detective was watching. While I was telling my story he was\r\nfollowing every movement of the shepherd. Suddenly he held up one\r\nfinger. I turned.\r\n\r\nIt was Queen. A low growl, guttural and suspicious. She was standing\r\nabout a foot from the portieres that separated the library from the\r\nother room--where we had lost Watson, and where Jerome had had his\r\nexperience with the old lady. Tense and rigid, one forepaw held up\r\nstealthily, her stub tail erect and the hair along her back bristled.\r\nAgain the low growl. I caught Jerome's eyes. It was queer.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Queen?” I spoke.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my voice she wagged her tail and looked round, then\r\nstepped between the curtains. Just her head. She drew back; her lips\r\ndrawn from her teeth, snarling. She was rigid, alert, vitalised. Somehow\r\nit made me cold. She was a brave dog; she feared nothing. The detective\r\nstepped forward and pulled the curtains apart. The room was empty. We\r\nlooked into each other's faces. What is there to instinct? What is its\r\nrange? We could see nothing.\r\n\r\nBut not to the dog. Her eyes glowed. Hate, fear, terror, her whole body\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” I said. I stepped into the room. But I hadn't counted on the\r\ndog. With a yelp she was upon me, had me by the calf of the leg and was\r\ndrawing me back. She stepped in front of me; a low, guttural growl of\r\nwarning. But there was nothing in that room; of that we were certain.\r\n\r\n“Beats me,” said the detective. “How does she know? Wonder if she would\r\nstop me?” He stepped forward. It was merely a repetition. She caught\r\nhim by the trouser-leg and drew him back. She crowded us away from the\r\ncurtain. It was almost magnetic. We could see nothing, neither could we\r\nfeel; was it possible that the dog could see beyond us? The detective\r\nspoke first:\r\n\r\n“Take her out of the room. Put her in the hall; tie her up.”\r\n\r\n“What's the idea?”\r\n\r\n“Merely this; I am going to examine the room. No, I am not afraid. I'll\r\nbe mighty glad if it does catch me. Anything so long as I get results.”\r\n\r\nBut it did us no good. We examined the room many times that night; both\r\nof us. In the end there was nothing, only the weirdness and uncertainty\r\nand the magnetic undercurrent which we could feel, but could not fathom.\r\nWhen we called in the dog she stepped to the portieres and commenced her\r\nvigil. She crouched slightly behind the curtains, alert, ready, waiting,\r\nat her post of honour. From that moment she never left the spot except\r\nunder compulsion. We could hear her at all times of the night; the low\r\ngrowl, the snarl, the defiance.\r\n\r\nBut there was a great deal more that we were to learn from the dog. It\r\nwas Jerome who first called my attention. A small fact at the beginning;\r\nbut of a strange sequence. This time it was the ring. Queen had the\r\nhabit that is common to most dogs; she would lick my hand to show her\r\naffection. It was nothing in itself; but for one fact--she always chose\r\nthe left hand. It was the detective who first noticed it. Always and\r\nevery opportunity she would lick the jewel. We made a little test to try\r\nher. I would remove the ring from one hand to the other; then hold it\r\nbehind me. She would follow.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange fact; but of course not inexplicable. A scent or the\r\nattraction of taste might account for it. However, these little tests\r\nled to a rather remarkable discovery.\r\n\r\nOne night we had called the dog from her vigil. As usual she came to\r\nthe jewel; by chance I pressed the gem against her head. It was a mere\r\ntrifle; yet it was of consequence. A few minutes before I had dropped a\r\nhandkerchief on the opposite side of the room; I was just thinking about\r\npicking it up. It was only a small thing, yet it put us on the track\r\nof the gem's strangest potency. The dog walked to the handkerchief. She\r\nbrought it back in her mouth. At first I took it for a pure coincidence.\r\nI repeated the experiment with a book. The same result. I looked up at\r\nJerome.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter?” Then when I explained: “The dickens! Try it again.”\r\n\r\nOver and over again we repeated it, using different articles, pieces of\r\nwhich I was certain she didn't know the name. There was a strange bond\r\nbetween the gem and the intelligence, some strange force emanating from\r\nits lustre. On myself it was depressing; on the dog it was life itself.\r\nAt last Jerome had an inspiration.\r\n\r\n“Try the Rhamda,” he said; “think of him. Perhaps--”\r\n\r\nIt was most surprising. Certainly it was remarkable. It was too much\r\nlike intelligence; a bit too uncanny. At the instant of the thought the\r\ndog leaped backward.\r\n\r\nSuch a strange transformation; she was naturally gentle. In one\r\ninstant she had gone mad. Mad? Not in the literal interpretation; but\r\nfiguratively. She sprang back, snapping; her teeth bared, her hair\r\nbristled. Her nostrils drawn. With one bound she leaped between the\r\ncurtains.\r\n\r\nJerome jumped up. With an exclamation he drew the portieres. I was\r\nbehind him. The dog was standing at the edge of the room, bristling.\r\n\r\nThe room was empty. What did she see? What?\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. Though we were sure of nothing else we were\r\ncertain of the Rhamda. We could trust the canine's instinct. Every\r\nprevious experiment we had essayed had been crowned with success. We had\r\nhere a fact but no explanation. If we could only put things together and\r\nextract the law.\r\n\r\nIt was late when we retired. I could not sleep. The restlessness of the\r\ndog held back my slumber. She would growl sullenly, then stir about for\r\na new position; she was never quite still. I could picture her there\r\nin the library, behind the curtains, crouched, half resting, half\r\nslumbering, always watching. I would awaken in the night and listen; a\r\nlow guttural warning, a sullen whine--then stillness. It was the same\r\nwith my companion. We could never quite understand it. Perhaps we were a\r\nbit afraid.\r\n\r\nBut one can become accustomed to almost anything. It went on for many\r\nnights without anything happening, until one night.\r\n\r\nIt was dark, exceedingly dark, with neither moon nor starlight; one of\r\nthose nights of inky intenseness. I cannot say just exactly what woke\r\nme. The house was strangely silent and still; the air seemed stretched\r\nand laden. It was summer. Perhaps it was the heat. I only knew that I\r\nwoke suddenly and blinked in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIn the next room with the door open I could hear the heavy breathing\r\nof the detective. A heavy feeling lay against my heart. I had grown\r\naccustomed to dread and isolation; but this was different. Perhaps\r\nit was premonition. I do not know. And yet I was terribly sleepy; I\r\nremember that.\r\n\r\nI struck a match and looked at my watch on the bureau--twelve\r\nthirty-five. No sound--not even Queen--not even a rumble from the\r\nstreets. I lay back and dropped into slumber. Just as I drifted off to\r\nsleep I had a blurring fancy of sound, guttural, whining, fearful--then\r\nsuddenly drifting into incoherent rumbling phantasms--a dream. I awoke\r\nsuddenly. Someone was speaking. It was Jerome.\r\n\r\n“Harry!”\r\n\r\nI was frightened. It was like something clutching out of the darkness.\r\nI sat up. I didn't answer. It wasn't necessary. The incoherence of my\r\ndream had been external. The library was just below me. I could hear the\r\ndog pacing to and fro, and her snarling. Snarling? It was just that. It\r\nwas something to arouse terror.\r\n\r\nShe had never growled like that--I was positive, I could hear her\r\nsuddenly leap back from the curtains. She barked. Never before had she\r\ncome to that. Then a sudden lunge into the other room--a vicious series\r\nof snapping barks, yelps--pandemonium--I could picture her leaping--at\r\nwhat? Then suddenly I leaped out of bed. The barks grew faint, faint,\r\nfainter--into the distance.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness I couldn't find the switch. I bumped into Jerome. We\r\nwere lost in our confusion. It was a moment before we could find either\r\na match or a switch to turn on the lights. But at last--I shall not\r\nforget that moment; nor Jerome. He was rigid; one arm held\r\naloft, his eyes bulged out. The whole house was full of\r\nsound--full-toned--vibrant--magnetic. It was the bell.\r\n\r\nI jumped for the stairway, but not so quick as Jerome. With three bounds\r\nwe were in the library with the lights on. The sound was running down\r\nto silence. We tore down the curtains and rushed into the room. It was\r\nempty!\r\n\r\nThere was not even the dog. Queen had gone! In a vain rush of grief I\r\nbegan calling and whistling. It was an overwhelming moment. The poor,\r\nbrave shepherd. She had seen it and rushed into its face.\r\n\r\nIt was the last night I was to have Jerome. We sat up until daylight.\r\nFor the thousandth time we went over the house in detail, but there was\r\nnothing. Only the ring. At the suggestion of the detective I touched the\r\nmatch to the sapphire. It was the same. The colour diminishing, and the\r\ntranslucent corridors deepening into the distance; then the blur and the\r\ncoming of shadows--the men, Watson and the professor--and my dog.\r\n\r\nOf the men, only the heads showed; but the dog was full figure; she was\r\nsitting, apparently on a pedestal, her tongue was lolling out of her\r\nmouth and her face of that gentle intelligence which only the Australian\r\nshepherd is heir to. That is all--no more--nothing. If we had hoped to\r\ndiscover anything through her medium we were disappointed. Instead of\r\nclearing up, the whole thing had grown deeper.\r\n\r\nI have said that it was the last night I was to have Jerome. I didn't\r\nknow it then. Jerome went out early in the morning. I went to bed. I\r\nwas not afraid in the daylight. I was certain now that the danger was\r\nlocalised. As long as I kept out of that apartment I had nothing to\r\nfear. Nevertheless, the thing was magnetic. A subtle weirdness pervaded\r\nthe building. I did not sleep soundly. I was lonely; the isolation was\r\ncrowding on me. In the afternoon I stepped out on the streets.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of my experience with the conductor. On this day I had the\r\ncertainty of my isolation; it was startling. In the face of what I was\r\nand what I had seen it was almost terrifying. It was the first time\r\nI thought of sending for Hobart. I had thought I could hold out. The\r\ncomplete suddenness of the thing set me to thinking. I thought of\r\nWatson. It was the last phase, the feebleness, the wanness, the inertia!\r\nHe had been a far stronger man than I in the beginning.\r\n\r\nI must cable Fenton. While I had still an ego in the presence of men, I\r\nmust reach out for help. It was a strange thing and inexplicable. I was\r\nnot invisible. Don't think that. I simply did not individualise. Men\r\ndidn't notice me--till I spoke. As if I was imperceptibly losing the\r\nessence of self. I still had some hold on the world. While it remained I\r\nmust get word to Hobart. I did not delay. Straight to the office I went\r\nand paid for the cable.\r\n\r\nCANNOT HOLD OUT MUCH LONGER. COME AT ONCE.--HARRY.\r\n\r\nI was a bit ashamed. I had hoped. I had counted upon myself. I\r\nhad trusted in the full strength of my individuality. I had been\r\nhealthy--strong--full blooded. On the fullness of vitality one would\r\nlive forever. There is no tomorrow. It was not a year ago. I was eighty.\r\nIt had been so with Watson. What was this subtle thing that ate into\r\none's marrow? I had read of banshees, lemures and leprechauns; they were\r\nthe ghosts and the fairies of ignorance but they were not like this. It\r\nwas impersonal, hidden, inexorable. It was mystery. And I believed that\r\nit was Nature.\r\n\r\nI know it now. Even as I write I can sense the potency of the force\r\nabout me. Some law, some principle, some force that science has not\r\nuncovered.\r\n\r\nWhat is that law that shall bridge the chaos between the mystic and the\r\nsubstantial? I am standing on the bridge; and I cannot see it. What is\r\nthe great law that was discovered by Dr. Holcomb? Who is the Rhamda? Who\r\nis the Nervina?\r\n\r\nJerome has not returned. I cannot understand it. It has been a week. I\r\nam living on brandy--not much of anything else--I am waiting for Fenton.\r\nI have taken all my elaborations and notes and put them together.\r\nPerhaps I--\r\n\r\n(This is the last of the strange document left by Harry Wendel. The\r\nfollowing memorandum is written by Charlotte Fenton.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nCHARLOTTE'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know. It is hard to write after what has happened.\r\n\r\nHobart says that it is why I am to write it. It is to be a plain\r\nnarrative. Besides, he is very busy and cannot do it himself. There must\r\nbe some record. I shall do my best and hold out of my writing as much as\r\nI can of my emotion. I shall start with the Nervina.\r\n\r\nIt was the first I knew; the first warning. Looking back I cannot but\r\nwonder. No person I think who has ever seen the Nervina can do much\r\nelse; she is so beautiful! Beautiful? Why do I say it? I should be\r\njealous and I should hate her. Yet I do not. Why is it?\r\n\r\nIt was about eight months after Hobart had left for South America. I\r\nremember those eight months as the longest in my life; because of Harry.\r\nI am a girl and I like attention; all girls do. Ordinarily he would come\r\nover every fortnight at least. After Hobart had gone he came once only,\r\nand of course I resented the inattention.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that no business could be of enough importance if he\r\nreally loved me. Even his letters were few and far between. What he\r\nwrote were slow and weary and of an undertone that I could not fathom.\r\nI--loved Harry. I could not understand it. I had a thousand fearful\r\nthoughts and jealousies; but they were feminine and in no way\r\napproximated even the beginning of the truth. Inattention was not like\r\nHarry. It was not until the coming of the Nervina that I was afraid.\r\n\r\nAfraid? I will not say that--exactly. It was rather a suspicion, a queer\r\nundercurrent of wonder and doubt. The beauty of the girl, her interest\r\nin Harry and myself, her concern over this ring, put me a bit on guard.\r\nI wondered what this ring had to do with Harry Wendel.\r\n\r\nShe did not tell me in exact words or in literal explanation; but she\r\nmanaged to convey all too well a lurking impression of its sinister\r\npotency. It was something baleful, something the very essence of which\r\nwould break down the life of one who wore it. Harry had come into its\r\npossession by accident and she would save him. She had failed through\r\ndirect appeal. Now she had come to me. She did not say a word of the\r\nBlind Spot.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day came Harry. It was really a shock, though I had been\r\nwarned by the girl. He was not Harry at all, but another. His eyes were\r\ndim and they had lost their lustre; when they did show light at all,\r\nit was a kind that was a bit fearful. He was wan, worn, and shrunk to a\r\nshadow, as if he had gone through a long illness.\r\n\r\nHe said he had not been sick. He maintained that he was quite well\r\nphysically. And on his finger was the ring of which the girl had spoken.\r\nIts value must have been incalculable. Wherever he moved his hand its\r\nblue flame cut a path through the darkness. But he said nothing about\r\nit. I waited and wondered and was afraid. It was not until our walk\r\nunder the elm trees that it was mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt was a full moon; a wonderful, mellow moon of summer. He stopped\r\nsuddenly and gazed up at the orb above us. It seemed to me that his\r\nmind was wandering, he held me closely--tenderly. He was not at all\r\nlike Harry. There was a missing of self, of individuality; he spoke in\r\nabstractions.\r\n\r\n“The maiden of the moonbeams?” he said. “What can it mean?”\r\n\r\nAnd then I asked him. He has already told of our conversation. It was\r\nthe ring of which the Nervina had told me. It had to do with the Blind\r\nSpot--the great secret that had taken Dr. Holcomb. He would not give it\r\nto me. I worked hard, for even then I was not afraid of it. Something\r\ntold me--I must do it to save him. It was weird, and something I could\r\nnot understand--but I must do it for Harry.\r\n\r\nI failed. Though he was broken in every visible way there was one thing\r\nas strong as ever--his honour. He was not afraid; he had been the same\r\nin his boyhood. When we parted that night he kissed me. I shall never\r\nforget how long he looked into my eyes, nor his sadness. That is all.\r\nThe next morning he left for San Francisco.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the end. A message; abrupt and sudden. It was some time\r\nafter and put a period to my increasing stress and worry. It read:\r\n\r\nCITY OF PERU DOCKS TONIGHT AT EIGHT. MEET ME AT THE PIER. HOBART\r\nCOMING,--HARRY.\r\n\r\nIt was a short message and a bit twisted. In ordinary circumstances he\r\nwould have motored down and brought me back to greet Hobart. It was a\r\nbit strange that I should meet him at the pier. However, I had barely\r\ntime to get to the city if I hurried.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget that night.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when I reached San Francisco. I was a full twenty minutes\r\nearly at the pier. A few people were waiting. I looked about for Harry.\r\nHe was to meet me and I was certain that I would find him. But he was\r\nnot there. Of course there was still time. He was sure to be on hand to\r\ngreet Hobart.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I had a vague mistrust. Since that strange visit I had not\r\nbeen sure. Harry wasn't well. There was something to this mystery that\r\nhe had not told me. Why had he asked me to meet him at the pier? Why\r\ndidn't he come? When the boat docked and he was still missing I was\r\ndoubly worried.\r\n\r\nHobart came down the gangplank. He was great, strong, healthy, and it\r\nseemed to me in a terrible hurry. He scanned the faces hurriedly and ran\r\nover to me.\r\n\r\n“Where's Harry?” He kissed me and in the same breath repeated, “Where's\r\nHarry?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Hobart!” I exclaimed. “What's the matter with Harry? Tell me. It's\r\nsomething terrible!”\r\n\r\nHe was afraid. Plainly I could see that! There were lines of anxiety\r\nabout his eyes. He clutched me by the arm and drew me away.\r\n\r\n“He was to meet me here,” I said. “He didn't come. He was to meet me\r\nhere! Oh, Hobart, I saw him some time ago. He was--it was not Harry at\r\nall! Do you know anything about it?”\r\n\r\nFor a minute he stood still, looking at me. I had never seen Hobart\r\nfrightened; but at that moment there was that in his eyes which I could\r\nnot understand. He caught me by the arm and started out almost at a\r\nrun. There were many people and we dodged in and out among them. Hobart\r\ncarried a suitcase. He hailed a taxi.\r\n\r\nI don't know how I got into the car. It was a blur. I was frightened.\r\nSome terrible thing had occurred, and Hobart knew it. I remember a few\r\nwords spoken to the driver. “Speed, speed, no limit; never mind the\r\nlaw--and Chatterton Place!” After that the convulsive jerking over the\r\ncobbled streets, a climbing over hills and twisted corners. And Hobart\r\nat my side. “Faster--faster,” he was saying; “faster! My lord, was there\r\never a car so slow! Harry! Harry!” I could hear him breathing a prayer.\r\nAnother hill; the car turned and came suddenly to a stop! Hobart leaped\r\nout.\r\n\r\nA sombre two-storey house; a light burning in one of the windows, a dim\r\nlight, almost subdued and uncanny. I had never seen anything so lonely\r\nas that light; it was grey, uncertain, scarcely a flicker. Perhaps\r\nit was my nerves. I had scarcely strength to climb the steps. Hobart\r\ngrasped the knob and thrust open the door; I can never forget it.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to write. The whole thing! The room; the walls lined with\r\nbooks; the dim, pale light, the faded green carpet, and the man. Pale,\r\nworn, almost a shadow of his former self. Was it Harry Wendel? He had\r\naged forty years. He was stooped, withered, exhausted. A bottle\r\nof brandy on the desk before him. In his weak, thin hand an empty\r\nwineglass. The gem upon his finger glowed with a flame that was almost\r\nwicked; it was blue, burning, giving out sparkles of light--like a\r\ncolour out of hell. The path of its light was unholy--it was too much\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nWe both sprang forward. Hobart seized him by the shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Harry, old boy; Harry! Don't you know us? It's Hobart and Charlotte.”\r\n\r\nIt was terrible. He didn't seem to know. He looked right at us. But he\r\nspoke in abstractions.\r\n\r\n“Two,” he said. And he listened. “Two! Don't you hear it?” He caught\r\nHobart by the arm. “Now, listen. Two! No, it's three. Did I say three?\r\nCan't you hear? It's the old lady. She speaks out of the shadows. There!\r\nThere! Now, listen. She has been counting to me. Always she says three!\r\nSoon it will be four.”\r\n\r\nWhat did he mean? What was it about? Who was the old lady? I looked\r\nround. I saw no one. Hobart stooped over. Harry began slowly to\r\nrecognise us. It was as if his mind had wandered and was coming back\r\nfrom a far place. He spoke slowly; his words were incoherent and\r\nrambling.\r\n\r\n“Hobart,” he said; “you know her. She is the maiden out of the\r\nmoonbeams. The Rhamda, he is our enemy. Hobart, Charlotte. I know so\r\nmuch. I cannot tell you. You are two hours late. It's a strange thing. I\r\nhave found it and I think I know. It came suddenly. The discovery of the\r\ngreat professor. Why didn't you come two hours earlier? We might have\r\nconquered.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped his head upon his arms; then as suddenly he looked up. He\r\ndrew the ring from his finger.\r\n\r\n“Give it to Charlotte,” he said. “It won't hurt her. Don't touch it\r\nyourself. Had I only known. Watson didn't know--”\r\n\r\nHe straightened; he was tense, rigid, listening.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear anything? Listen! Can you hear? It's the old lady. There--”\r\n\r\nBut there was not a sound; only the rumble of the streets, the ticking\r\nof the clock, and our heart-beats. Again he went through the counting.\r\n\r\n“Hobart!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Harry.”\r\n\r\n“And Charlotte! The ring--ah, yet it was there, Keep it. Give it to no\r\none. Two hours ago we might have conquered. But I had to keep the ring.\r\nIt was too much, too powerful; a man may not wear it. Charlotte”--he\r\ntook my hand and ran the ring upon my finger. “Poor Charlotte. Here is\r\nthe ring. The most wonderful--”\r\n\r\nAgain he dropped over. He was weak--there was something going from him\r\nminute by minute.\r\n\r\n“Water,” he asked. “Hobart, some water.”\r\n\r\nIt was too pitiful. Harry, our Harry--come to a strait like this! Hobart\r\nrushed to another room with the tumbler. I could hear him fumbling. I\r\nstooped over Harry. But he held up his hand.\r\n\r\n“No, Charlotte, no. You must not. If--”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. Again the strange attention, as if he was listening to\r\nsomething far off in the distance; the pupils of his hollow, worn,\r\nlustreless eyes were pin-points. He stood on his feet rigid, quivering;\r\nthen he held up his hand. “Listen!”\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing. It was just as before; merely the murmuring of\r\nthe city night, and the clock ticking.\r\n\r\n“It's the dog! D'you hear her? And the old lady. Now listen, 'Two!\r\nNow there are two! Three! Three! Now there are three!' There--now.” He\r\nturned to me. “Can you hear it, Charlotte? No? How strange. Perhaps--”\r\n He pointed to the corner of the room. “That paper. Will you--”\r\n\r\nI shall always go over that moment. I have thought over it many times\r\nand have wondered at the sequence. Had I not stepped across the library,\r\nwhat would have happened?\r\n\r\nWhat was it.\r\n\r\nI had stooped to pick up the piece of paper. There came a queer,\r\ncracking, snapping sound, almost audible, I have a strange recollection\r\nof Harry standing up by the side of the desk--a flitting\r\nvision. An intuition of some terrible force. It was out of\r\nnothing--nowhere--approaching. I turned about. And I saw it--the dot of\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nBlue! That is what it was at first. Blue and burning, like the flame\r\nof a million jewels centred into a needlepoint. On the ceiling directly\r\nabove Harry's head. It was scintillating, coruscating, opalescent; but\r\nit was blue most of all. It was the colour of life and of death; it was\r\nburning, throbbing, concentrated. I tried to scream. But I was frozen\r\nwith horror. The dot changed colour and went to a dead-blue. It seemed\r\nto grow larger and to open. Then it turned to white and dropped like a\r\nstring of incandescence, touching Harry on the head.\r\n\r\nWhat was it? It was all so sudden. A door flung open and a swish of\r\nrushing silk. A woman! A beautiful girl! The Nervina! It was she!\r\n\r\nNever have I seen anyone like her. She was so beautiful. In her face all\r\nthe compassion a woman is heir to. For scarcely a second she stopped.\r\n\r\n“Charlotte,” she called. “Charlotte--oh, why didn't you save him! He\r\nloves you!” Then she turned to Harry. “It shall not be. He shall not go\r\nalone. I shall save him, even beyond--”\r\n\r\nWith that she rushed upon Harry. It was all done in an instant. Her arms\r\nwere outstretched to the dimming form of Harry and the incandescence.\r\nThe splendid impassioned girl. Their forms intermingled. A blur of her\r\nbeautiful body and Harry's wan, weary face. A flash of light, a thread\r\nof incandescence, a quiver--and they were gone.\r\n\r\nThe next I knew was the strong arms of my brother Hobart. He gave me the\r\nwater he had fetched for Harry. He was terribly upset, but very calm. He\r\nheld the glass up to my lips. He was speaking.\r\n\r\n“Don't worry. Don't worry. I know now. I think I know. I was just in\r\ntime to see them go. I heard the bell. Harry is safe. It is the Nervina.\r\nI shall get Harry. We'll solve the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nHOBART FENTON TAKES UP THE TALE\r\n\r\n\r\nRight here at the outset, I had better make a clean breast of something\r\nwhich the reader will very soon suspect, anyhow: I am a plain, unpoetic,\r\nblunt-speaking man, trained as a civil engineer, and in most respects\r\ntotally dissimilar from the man who wrote the first account of the Blind\r\nSpot.\r\n\r\nHarry had already touched upon this. He came of an artistic family. I\r\nthink he must have taken up law in the hope that the old saying would\r\nprove true: “The only certain thing about law is its uncertainty.” For\r\nhe dearly loved the mysterious, the unknowable; he liked uncertainty for\r\nits excitement: and it is a mighty good thing that he was honest, for he\r\nwould have made a highly dangerous crook.\r\n\r\nObserve that I use the past tense in referring to my old friend. I do\r\nthis in the interests of strict, scientific accuracy, to satisfy those\r\nwho would contend that, having utterly vanished from sight and sound of\r\nman, Harry Wendel is no more.\r\n\r\nBut in my own heart is the firm conviction that he is still very much\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of his astounding disappearance, my sister, Charlotte,\r\nand I made our way to an hotel; and despite the terrible nature of what\r\nhad happened, we managed to get a few hours rest. The following morning\r\nCharlotte declared herself quite strong enough to discuss the situation.\r\nWe lost no time.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that I had spent nearly the whole of the preceding\r\nyear in South America, putting through an irrigation scheme. Thus, I\r\nknew little of what had occurred in that interval. On the other hand,\r\nHarry and I had never seen fit to take Charlotte into our confidence as,\r\nI now see, we should have done.\r\n\r\nSo we fairly pounced upon the manuscript which Harry had left behind.\r\nAnd by the time we had finished reading it, I for one, had reached one\r\nsolid conclusion.\r\n\r\n“I'm convinced,” I said, “that the stranger--Rhamda Avec--is an\r\nout-and-out villain. Despite his agreeable ways, I think he was solely\r\nand deliberately to blame for Professor Holcomb's disappearance.\r\nConsequently, this Rhamda is, in himself, a very valuable clue as to\r\nHarry's present predicament.”\r\n\r\nReferring to Harry's notes, I pointed out the fact that, although Avec\r\nhad often been seen on the streets of San Francisco, yet the police had\r\nnever been able to lay hands on him. This seemed to indicate that\r\nthe man might possess the power of actually making himself visible or\r\ninvisible, at will.\r\n\r\n“Only”--I was careful to add--“understand, I don't rank him as a\r\nmagician, or sorcerer; nothing like that. I'd rather think that he's\r\nmerely in possession of a scientific secret, no more wonderful in\r\nitself than, say, wireless. He's merely got hold of it in advance of the\r\nothers; that's all.”\r\n\r\n“Then you think that the woman, too, is human?”\r\n\r\n“The Nervina?” I hesitated. “Perhaps you know more of this part of the\r\nthing than I do.”\r\n\r\n“I only know”--slowly--“that she came and told me that Harry was soon to\r\ncall. And somehow, I never felt jealous of her, Hobart.” Then she added:\r\n“At the same time, I can understand that Harry might--might have fallen\r\nin love with her. She--she was very beautiful.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte is a brave girl. She kept her voice as steady as my own.\r\n\r\nWe next discussed the disappearance of Chick Watson. These details are\r\nalready familiar to the reader of Harry's story; likewise what happened\r\nto Queen, his Australian shepherd. Like the other vanishings, it was\r\nfollowed by a single stroke on that prodigious, invisible bell--what\r\nHarry calls “The Bell of the Blind Spot.” And he has already mentioned\r\nmy opinion, that this phenomenon signifies the closing of the portal of\r\nthe unknown--the end of the special conditions which produce the bluish\r\nspot on the ceiling, the incandescent streak of light, and the vanishing\r\nof whoever falls into the affected region. The mere fact that no trace\r\nof the bell ever was found has not shaken my opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we reached the final disappearance, that which took away Harry.\r\nCharlotte contrived to keep her voice as resolute as before, as she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“He and the Nervina vanished together. I turned round just as she rushed\r\nin, crying out, 'I can't let you go alone! I'll save you, even beyond.'\r\nThat's all she said, before--it happened.”\r\n\r\n“You saw nothing of the Rhamda then?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nAnd we had neither seen nor heard of him since. Until we got in touch\r\nwith him, one important clue as to Harry's fate was out of our reach.\r\nThere remained to us just one thread of hope--the ring, which Charlotte\r\nwas now wearing on her finger.\r\n\r\nI lit a match and held it to the face of the gem. As happened many times\r\nbefore, the stone exhibited its most astounding quality. As soon as\r\nfaintly heated, the surface at first clouded, then cleared in a curious\r\nfashion, revealing a startling distinct, miniature likeness of the four\r\nwho had vanished into the Blind Spot.\r\n\r\nI make no attempt to explain this. Somehow or other, that stone\r\npossesses a telescopic quality which brings to a focus, right in front\r\nof the beholder's eyes, a tiny “close-up” of our vanished friends. Also,\r\nthe gem magnifies what it reveals, so that there is not the slightest\r\ndoubt that Dr. Holcomb, Chick Watson, Queen and Harry Wendel are\r\nactually reproduced--I shall not say, contained--in that gem. Neither\r\nshall I say that they are reflected; they are simply reproduced there.\r\n\r\nAlso, it should be understood that their images are living. Only the\r\nheads and shoulders of the men are to be seen; but there is animation\r\nof the features, such as cannot be mistaken. Granted that these four\r\nvanished in the Blind Spot--whatever that is--and granted that this ring\r\nis some inexplicable window or vestibule between that locality and this\r\ncommonplace world of ours, then, manifestly, it would seem that all four\r\nare still alive.\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it!” declared Charlotte, managing to smile, wistfully,\r\nat the living reproduction of her sweetheart. “And I think Harry did\r\nperfectly right, in handing it to me to keep.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Well, if for no other reason than because it behaves so differently\r\nwith me, than it did with him.\r\n\r\n“Hobart, I am inclined to think that this fact is very significant. If\r\nChick had only known of it, he wouldn't have insisted that Harry should\r\nwear it; and then--”\r\n\r\n“Can't be helped,” I interrupted quickly. “Chick didn't know; he was\r\nonly certain that someone--SOMEONE--must wear the ring; that it mustn't\r\npass out of the possession of humans. Moreover, much as Rhamda Avec may\r\ndesire it--and the Nervina, too--neither can secure it through the use\r\nof force. Nobody knows why.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte shivered. “I'm afraid there's something spooky about it, after\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the sort,” with a conviction that has never left me. “This\r\nring is a perfectly sound fact, as indisputable as the submarine.\r\nThere's nothing supernatural about it; for that matter, I personally\r\ndoubt if there's ANYTHING supernatural. Every phenomenon which seems,\r\nat first, so wonderful, becomes commonplace enough as soon as explained.\r\nIsn't it true that you yourself are already getting used to that ring?”\r\n\r\n“Ye--es,” reluctantly. “That is, partly. If only it were someone other\r\nthan Harry!”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” I hurried to say, “I only wanted to make it clear that\r\nwe haven't any witchcraft to deal with. This whole mystery will become\r\nplain as day, and that damned soon!”\r\n\r\n“You've got a theory?”--hopefully.\r\n\r\n“Several; that's the trouble!” I had to admit. “I don't know which is\r\nbest to follow out.--It may be a spiritualistic thing after all. Or\r\nit may fall under the head of 'abnormal psychology'. Nothing but\r\nhallucinations, in other words.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that won't do!”--evidently distressed. “I know what I saw! I'd\r\ndoubt my reason if I thought I'd only fancied it!”\r\n\r\n“So would I. Well, laying aside the spiritualistic theory, there remains\r\nthe possibility of some hitherto undiscovered scientific secret. And\r\nif the Rhamda is in possession of it, then the matter simmers down to a\r\nplain case of villainy.”\r\n\r\n“But how does he do it?”\r\n\r\n“That's the whole question. However, I'm sure of this”--I was fingering\r\nthe ring as I spoke. The reproduction of our friends had faded, now,\r\nleaving that dully glowing pale blue light once more. “This ring is\r\nabsolutely real; it's no hallucination. It performs as well in broad\r\ndaylight as in the night; no special conditions needed. It's neither a\r\nfraud nor an illusion.\r\n\r\n“In short, this ring is merely a phenomenon which science has not YET\r\nexplained! That it can and will be explained is strictly up to us! Once\r\nwe understand its peculiar properties, we can mighty soon rescue Harry!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was just then that a most extraordinary thing occurred. It\r\nhappened so very unexpectedly, so utterly without warning, that it makes\r\nme shaky to this day whenever I recall it.\r\n\r\nFrom the gem on Charlotte's finger--or rather, from the air surrounding\r\nthe ring--came an unmistakable sound. We saw nothing whatever; we only\r\nheard. And it was clear, as loud and as startling as though it had\r\noccurred right in the room where we were discussing the situation.\r\n\r\nIt was the sharp, joyous bark of a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF MIRACLES\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking back over what has just been written, I am sensible of a\r\nprofound gratitude. I am grateful, both because I have been given the\r\nprivilege of relating these events, and because I shall not have to\r\nleave this wilderness of facts for someone else to explain.\r\n\r\nReally, if I did not know that I shall have the pleasure of piecing\r\ntogether these phenomena and of setting my finger upon the comparatively\r\nsimple explanation; if I had to go away and leave this account\r\nunfinished, a mere collection of curiosity-provoking mysteries, I should\r\nnot speak at all. I should leave the whole affair for another to finish,\r\nas it ought to be finished.\r\n\r\nAll of which, it will soon appear, I am setting forth largely in order\r\nto brace and strengthen myself against what I must now relate.\r\n\r\nBefore resuming, however, I should mention one detail which Harry was\r\ntoo modest to mention. He was--or is--unusually good-looking. I don't\r\nmean to claim that he possessed any Greek-god beauty; such wouldn't gibe\r\nwith a height of five foot seven. No; his good looks were due to the\r\nsimple outward expression, through his features, of a certain noble\r\ninward quality which would have made the homeliest face attractive.\r\nSelfishness will spoil the handsomest features; unselfishness will\r\nglorify.\r\n\r\nMoreover, simply because he had given his word to Chick Watson that he\r\nwould wear the ring, Harry took upon himself the most dangerous task\r\nthat any man could assume, and he had lost. But had he known in advance\r\nexactly what was going to happen to him, he would have stuck to his\r\nword, anyhow. And since there was a sporting risk attached to it, since\r\nthe thing was not perfectly sure to end tragically, he probably enjoyed\r\nthe greater part of his experience.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not like that. Frankly, I'm an opportunist; essentially, a\r\npractical sort of fellow. I have a great admiration for idealists, but\r\na much greater admiration for results. For instance, I have seldom given\r\nmy word, even though the matter is unimportant; for I will cheerfully\r\nbreak my word if, later on, it should develop that the keeping of my\r\nword would do more harm than good.\r\n\r\nI realise perfectly well that it is dangerous ground to tread upon; yet\r\nI must refer the reader to what I have accomplished in this world, as\r\nproof that my philosophy is not as bad as it looks.\r\n\r\nI beg nobody's pardon for talking about myself so much at the outset.\r\nThis account will be utterly incomprehensible if I am not understood. My\r\nmethod of solving the Blind Spot mystery is, when analysed, merely the\r\nexpression of my personality. My sole idea has been to get RESULTS.\r\n\r\nAs Harry has put it, a proposition must be reduced to concrete form\r\nbefore I will have anything to do with it. If the Blind Spot had been\r\na totally occult affair, demanding that the investigation be conducted\r\nunder cover of darkness, surrounded by black velvet, crystal spheres and\r\nincense; demanding the aid of a clairvoyant or other “medium,” I should\r\nnever have gone near it. But as soon as the mystery began to manifest\r\nitself in terms that I could understand, appreciate and measure, then I\r\ntook interest.\r\n\r\nThat is why old Professor Holcomb appealed to me; he had proposed that\r\nwe prove the occult by physical means. “Reduce it to the scope of our\r\nfive senses,” he had said, in effect. From that moment on I was his\r\ndisciple.\r\n\r\nI have told of hearing that sharp, welcoming bark, emitted either from\r\nthe gem or from the air surrounding it. This event took place on the\r\nfront porch of the house at 288 Chatterton Place, as Charlotte and I sat\r\nthere talking it over. We had taken a suite at the hotel, but had come\r\nto the house of the Blind Spot in order to decide upon a course of\r\naction. And, in a way, that mysterious barking decided it for us.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the hotel, and gave notice that we would leave the next\r\nday. Next, we began to make preparations for moving into the Chatterton\r\nPlace dwelling.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, while in the midst of giving orders for furnishings and\r\nthe like, there at the hotel, I was called to the telephone. It was from\r\na point outside the building.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fenton?”--in a man's voice. And when I had assured him; “You have\r\nno reason to recognise my voice. I am--Rhamda Avec.”\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda! What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“To speak with your sister, Mr. Fenton.” Odd how very agreeable the\r\nman's tones! “Will you kindly call her to the telephone?”\r\n\r\nI saw no objection. However, when Charlotte came to my side I whispered\r\nfor her to keep the man waiting while I darted out into the corridor and\r\nslipped downstairs, where the girl at the switchboard put an instrument\r\ninto the circuit for me. Money talks. However--\r\n\r\n“My dear child,” the voice of Avec was saying, “you do me an injustice.\r\nI have nothing but your welfare at heart. I assure you that if anything\r\nshould happen to you and your brother while at Chatterton Place, it will\r\nbe through no fault of mine.\r\n\r\n“At the same time I can positively assure you that, if you stay away\r\nfrom there, no harm will come to either of you; absolutely none! I can\r\nguarantee that. Don't ask me why; but, if you value your safety, stay\r\nwhere you are, or go elsewhere, anywhere other than to the house in\r\nChatterton Place.”\r\n\r\n“I can hardly agree with you, Mr. Avec.” Plainly Charlotte was deeply\r\nimpressed with the man's sincerity and earnestness. “My brother's\r\njudgment is so much better than mine, that I--” and she paused\r\nregretfully.\r\n\r\n“I only wish,” with his remarkable gracefulness, “that your intuition\r\nwere as strong as your loyalty to your brother. If it were, you would\r\nknow that I speak the truth when I say that I have only your welfare at\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\n“I--I am sorry, Mr. Avec.”\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, there is one alternative,” even more agreeable than\r\nbefore. “If you prefer not to take my advice, but cling to your\r\nbrother's decision, you can still avoid the consequences of his\r\ndetermination to live in that house. As I say, I cannot prevent harm\r\nfrom befalling you, under present conditions; but these conditions\r\ncan be completely altered if you will make a single concession, Miss\r\nFenton.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” eagerly.\r\n\r\n“That you give me the ring!”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a very tense second. I wished I could see his peculiar,\r\nyoung-old face--the face with the inscrutable eyes; the face that urged,\r\nrather than inspired, both curiosity and confidence.\r\n\r\nThen he added:\r\n\r\n“I know why you wear it; I realise that the trinket carries some very\r\ntender associations. And I would never ask such a concession did I not\r\nknow, were your beloved here at this moment, he would endorse every word\r\nthat I say, and--”\r\n\r\n“Harry!” cried Charlotte, her voice shaking. “He would tell me to give\r\nit to you?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure of it! It is as though he, through me, were urging you to do\r\nthis!”\r\n\r\nFor some moments there was silence. Charlotte must have been\r\ntremendously impressed. It certainly was amazing the degree of\r\nconfidence that Avec's voice induced. I wouldn't have been greatly\r\nsurprised had my sister--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Avec,” came Charlotte's voice, hesitatingly, almost sorrowfully.\r\n“I--I would like to believe you; but--but Harry himself gave me the\r\nring, and I feel--oh, I'm sure that my brother would never agree to it!”\r\n\r\n“I understand.” Somehow the fellow managed to conceal any disappointment\r\nhe may have felt. He contrived to show only a deep sympathy for\r\nCharlotte as he finished: “If I find it possible to protect you, I\r\nshall, Miss Fenton.”\r\n\r\nAfter it was all over, and I returned to the rooms, Charlotte and\r\nI concluded that it might have been better had we made some sort of\r\ncompromise. If we had made a partial concession, he might have told us\r\nsomething of the mystery. We ought to have bargained. We decided that if\r\nhe made any attempt to carry out what I felt sure were merely a thinly\r\nveiled threat to punish us for keeping the gem, we must not only be\r\nready for whatever he might do, but try to trap and keep him as well.\r\n\r\nThat same day found us back at Chatterton Place. Inside, there was\r\naltogether too much evidence that the place had been bachelors'\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to clean up. We hired lots of help, and made a quick\r\nthorough job of both floors. The basement we left untouched. And the\r\nnext day we put a force of painters and decorators to work; whereby\r\nhangs the tale.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Fenton,” called the head painter, as he varnished the “trim” in the\r\nparlour, “I wish you'd come and see what to make of this.”\r\n\r\nI stepped into the front room. He was pointing to the long piece of\r\nfinish which spanned the doorway leading into the dining-room. And he\r\nindicated a spot almost in the exact middle, a spot covering a space\r\nabout five inches broad and as high as the width of the wood. In outline\r\nit was roughly octagonal.\r\n\r\n“I've been trying my best,” stated Johnson, “to varnish that spot for\r\nthe past five minutes. But I'll be darned if I can do it!”\r\n\r\nAnd he showed what he meant. Every other part of the door glistened\r\nwith freshly applied varnish; but the octagonal region remained dull, as\r\nthough no liquid had ever touched it. Johnson dipped his brush into the\r\ncan, and applied a liberal smear of the fluid to the place. Instantly\r\nthe stuff disappeared.\r\n\r\n“Blamed porous piece of wood,” eyeing me queerly. “Or--do you think it's\r\nmerely porous, Mr. Fenton?”\r\n\r\nFor answer I took a brush and repeatedly daubed the place. It was like\r\ndropping ink on a blotter. The wood sucked up the varnish as a desert\r\nmight suck up water.\r\n\r\n“There's about a quart of varnish in the wood already,” observed\r\nJohnson, as I stared and pondered. “Suppose we take it down and weigh\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nInside of a minute we had that piece of trim down from its place. First,\r\nI carefully examined the timber framework behind, expecting to see\r\ntraces of the varnish where, presumably, it had seeped through. There\r\nwas no sign. Then I inspected the reverse side of the finish, just\r\nbehind the peculiar spot. I thought I might see a region of wide open\r\npores in the grain of the pine. But the back looked exactly the same as\r\nthe front, with no difference in the grain at any place.\r\n\r\nPlacing the finish right side up, I proceeded to daub the spot some\r\nmore. There was no change in the results. At last I took the can, and\r\nwithout stopping, poured a quart and a half of the fluid into that\r\nparadoxical little area.\r\n\r\n“Well I'll be darned!”--very loudly from Johnson. But when I looked up I\r\nsaw his face was white, and his lips shaking.\r\n\r\nHis nerves were all a-jangle. To give his mind a rest, I sent him for a\r\nhatchet. When he came back his face had regained its colour. I directed\r\nhim to hold the pine upright, while I, with a single stroke, sank the\r\ntool into the end of the wood.\r\n\r\nIt split part way. A jerk, and the wood fell in two halves.\r\n\r\n“Well?” from Johnson, blankly.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly normal wood, apparently.” I had to admit that it was\r\nimpossible to distinguish the material which constituted the peculiar\r\nspot from that which surrounded it.\r\n\r\nI sent Johnson after more varnish. Also, I secured several other fluids,\r\nincluding water, milk, ink, and machine oil. And when the painter\r\nreturned we proceeded with a very thorough test indeed.\r\n\r\nPresently it became clear that we were dealing with a phenomenon of the\r\nBlind Spot. All told, we poured about nine pints of liquid into an area\r\nof about twenty square inches; all on the outer surface, for the\r\nsplit side would absorb nothing. And to all appearances we might have\r\ncontinued to pour indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later I went down into the basement to dispose of some\r\nrubbish. (Charlotte didn't know of this defection in our housekeeping.)\r\nIt was bright sunlight outside. Thanks to the basement windows, I needed\r\nno artificial luminant. And when my gaze rested upon the ground directly\r\nunder the parlour, I saw something there that I most certainly had never\r\nnoticed before.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the basement at 288 Chatterton Place never did possess\r\nanything worthy of special notice. Except for the partition which\r\nHarry Wendel and Jerome, the detective, were the first in years to\r\npenetrate--except for that secret doorway, there was nothing down there\r\nto attract attention. To be sure, there was a quantity of up-turned\r\nearth, the result of Jerome's vigorous efforts to see whether or not\r\nthere was any connection between the Blind Spot phenomena which he had\r\nwitnessed and the cellar. He had secured nothing but an appetite for all\r\nhis digging.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was still too dark for me to identify what I saw at once. I\r\nstood for a few moments, accustoming my eyes to the light. Except that\r\nthe thing gleamed oddly like a piece of glass, and that it possessed\r\na nearly circular outline about two feet across, I couldn't tell much\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nThen I stooped and examined it closely. At once I became conscious of a\r\nsmell which, somehow, I had hitherto not noticed. Small wonder; it\r\nwas as indescribable a smell as one could imagine. It seemed to be a\r\ncombination of several that are not generally combined.\r\n\r\nNext instant it flashed upon me that the predominating odour was a\r\nfamiliar one. I had been smelling it, in fact, all the morning.\r\n\r\nBut this did not prevent me from feeling very queer, indeed, as I\r\nrealised what lay before me. A curious chill passed around my shoulders,\r\nand I scarcely breathed.\r\n\r\nAt my feet lay a pool, composed of all the various liquids that had been\r\npoured, upstairs, into that baffling spot in the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nOUT OF THIN AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for the incident just related, when several pints of very real\r\nfluids were somehow “materialised” at a spot ten feet below where they\r\nhad vanished, nothing worth recording occurred during the first seven\r\ndays of our stay at Chatterton Place.\r\n\r\nSeemingly nothing was to come of the Rhamda's warning.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we succeeded, during that week, in working a complete\r\ntransformation of the old house. It became one of the brightest spots in\r\nSan Francisco. It cost a good deal of money, all told, but I could well\r\nafford it. I possessed the hundred thousand with which, I had promised\r\nmyself and Harry, I should solve the Blind Spot. That was what the money\r\nwas for.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day after the night of Harry's going, our household was\r\nincreased to three members. For it was then that Jerome returned from\r\nNevada, whence he had gone two weeks before on a case.\r\n\r\n“Not at all surprised,” he commented, when I told him of Harry's\r\ndisappearance. “Sorry I wasn't here. That crook, Rhamda Avec, in at the\r\nend?”\r\n\r\nHe gnawed stolidly at his cigar as I told him the story. Then, after\r\nbriefly approving what I had done to brighten the house, he announced:\r\n\r\n“Tell you what. I've got a little money out of that Nevada case; I'm\r\ngoing to take another vacation and see this thing through.”\r\n\r\nWe shook hands on this, and he moved right into his old room. I felt, in\r\nfact, mighty glad to have Jerome with us. Although he lacked a regular\r\nacademic training, he was fifteen years my senior, and because of\r\ncontact with a wide variety of people in his work, both well-informed\r\nand reserved in his judgment. He could not be stampeded; he had courage;\r\nand, above everything else, he had the burning curiosity of which Harry\r\nhas written.\r\n\r\nI was upstairs when he unpacked. And I noted among his belongings a\r\nlarge, rather heavy automatic pistol. He nodded when I asked if he was\r\nwilling to use it in this case.\r\n\r\n“Although”--unbuttoning his waistcoat--“I don't pin as much faith to\r\npistols as I used to.\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda is, I'm convinced, the very cleverest proposition that\r\never lived. He has means to handle practically anything in the way of\r\nresistance.” Jerome knew how the fellow had worsted Harry and me. “I\r\nshouldn't wonder if he can read the mind to some extent; he might be\r\nable to foresee that I was going to draw a gun, and beat me to it with\r\nsome new weapon of his own.”\r\n\r\nHaving unbuttoned his waistcoat, Jerome then displayed a curious\r\ncontrivance mounted upon his breast. It consisted of a broad metal\r\nplate, strapped across his shirt, and affixed to this plate was a\r\nflat-springed arrangement for firing, simultaneously, the contents of\r\na revolver cylinder. To show how it worked, Jerome removed the five\r\ncartridges and then faced me.\r\n\r\n“Tell me to throw up my hands,” directed he. I did so; his palms flew\r\ninto the air; and with a steely snap the mechanism was released.\r\n\r\nHad there been cartridges in it, I should have been riddled, for I\r\nstood right in front. And I shuddered as I noted the small straps around\r\nJerome's wrists, running up his sleeves, so disposed that the act of\r\nsurrendering meant instant death to him who might demand.\r\n\r\n“May not be ethical, Fenton”--quietly--“but it certainly is good sense\r\nto shoot first and explain later when you're handling a chap like Avec.\r\nBetter make preparations, too.”\r\n\r\nI objected. I pointed out what I have already mentioned; that, together\r\nwith the ring, the Rhamda offered our only clues to the Blind Spot.\r\nDestroy the man and we would destroy one of our two hopes of rescuing\r\nour friends from the unthinkable fate that had overtaken them.\r\n\r\n“No”--decisively. “We don't want to kill; we want to KEEP him. Bullets\r\nwon't do. I see no reason, however, why you shouldn't load that thing\r\nwith cartridges containing chemicals which would have an effect similar\r\nto that of a gas bomb. Once you can make him helpless, so that you can\r\nput those steel bracelets on him, we'll see how dangerous he is with his\r\nhands behind him!”\r\n\r\n“I get you”--thoughtfully. “I know a chemist who will make up\r\n'Paralysis' gas for me, in the form of gelatine capsules. Shoot 'em at\r\nthe Rhamda; burst upon striking. Safe enough for me, and yet put him out\r\nof business long enough to fit him with the jewellery.”\r\n\r\n“That's the idea.”\r\n\r\nBut I had other notions about handling the Rhamda. Being satisfied that\r\nmere strength and agility were valueless against him, I concluded that\r\nhe, likewise realising this, would be on the lookout for any possible\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if I hoped to keep the man, and force him to tell us what\r\nwe wanted to know, then I must make use of something other than physical\r\nmeans. Moreover, I gave him credit for an exceptional amount of insight.\r\nCall it super-instinct, or what you will, the fellow's intellect was\r\ntranscendental.\r\n\r\nOnce having decided that it must be a battle of wits I took a step which\r\nmay seem, at first, a little peculiar.\r\n\r\nI called upon a certain lady to whom I shall give the name of Clarke,\r\nsince that is not the correct one. I took her fully and frankly into my\r\nconfidence. It is the only way, when dealing with a practitioner. And\r\nsince, like most of my fellow citizens, she had heard something of\r\nthe come and go, elusive habits of our men, together with the Holcomb\r\naffair, it was easy for her to understand just what I wanted.\r\n\r\n“I see,” she mused. “You wish to be surrounded by an influence that will\r\nnot so much protect you, as vitalise and strengthen you whenever you\r\ncome in contact with Avec. It will be a simple matter. How far do\r\nyou wish to go?” And thus it was arranged, the plan calling for the\r\nco-operation of some twenty of her colleagues.\r\n\r\nMy fellow engineers may sneer, if they like. I know the usual notion:\r\nthat the “power of mind over matter” is all in the brain of the patient.\r\nThat the efforts of the practitioner are merely inductive, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut I think that the most sceptical will agree that I did quite right in\r\nseeking whatever support I could get before crossing swords with a man\r\nas keen as Avec.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, before an opportunity arrived to make use of the\r\nintellectual machinery which my money had started into operation,\r\nsomething occurred which almost threw the whole thing out of gear.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening after I had returned from Miss Clarke's office. Both\r\nCharlotte and I had a premonition, after supper, that things were going\r\nto happen. We all went into the parlour, sat down, and waited.\r\n\r\nPresently we started the gramophone. Jerome sat nearest the instrument,\r\nwhere he could without rising, lean over and change the records. And all\r\nthree of us recall that the selection being played at the moment was “I\r\nAm Climbing Mountains,” a sentimental little melody sung by a popular\r\ntenor. Certainly the piece was far from being melancholy, mysterious, or\r\notherwise likely to attract the occult.\r\n\r\nI remember that we played it twice, and it was just as the singer\r\nreached the beginning of the final chorus that Charlotte, who sat\r\nnearest the door, made a quick move and shivered, as though with cold.\r\n\r\nFrom where I sat, near the dining-room door, I could see through into\r\nthe hall. Charlotte's action made me think that the door might have\r\nbecome unlatched, allowing a draught to come through. Afterwards she\r\nsaid that she had felt something rather like a breeze pass her chair.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room stood a long, massive table, of conventional\r\nlibrary type. Overhead was a heavy, burnished copper fixture, from which\r\na cluster of electric bulbs threw their brilliance upward, so that the\r\nroom was evenly lighted with the diffused rays as reflected from the\r\nceiling. Thus, there were no shadows to confuse the problem.\r\n\r\nThe chorus of the song was almost through when I heard from the\r\ndirection of the table a faint sound, as though someone had drawn\r\nfingers lightly across the polished oak. I listened; the sound was not\r\nrepeated, at least not loud enough for me to catch it above the music.\r\nNext moment, however, the record came to an end; Jerome leaned forward\r\nto put on another, and Charlotte opened her mouth as though to suggest\r\nwhat the new selection might be. But she never said the words.\r\n\r\nIt began with a scintillating iridescence, up on the ceiling, not eight\r\nfeet from where I sat. As I looked the spot grew, and spread, and flared\r\nout. It was blue like the elusive blue of the gem; only, it was more\r\nlike flame--the flame of electrical apparatus.\r\n\r\nThen, down from that blinding radiance there crept, rather than dropped\r\na single thread of incandescence, vivid, with a tinge of the colour\r\nfrom which it had surged. Down it crept to the floor; it was like an\r\nirregular streak of lightning, hanging motionless between ceiling and\r\nfloor, just for the fraction of a second. All in total silence.\r\n\r\nAnd then the radiance vanished, disappeared, snuffed out as one might\r\nsnuff out a candle. And in its stead--\r\n\r\nThere appeared a fourth person in the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nTHE ROUSING OF A MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a girl. Not the Nervina. No; this girl was quite another person.\r\n\r\nEven now I find it curiously hard to describe her. For me to say that\r\nshe was the picture of innocence, of purity, and of youth, is still to\r\nleave unsaid the secret of her loveliness.\r\n\r\nFor this stranger, coming out of the thin air into our midst, held me\r\nwith a glorious fascination. From the first I felt no misgivings, such\r\nas Harry confesses he experienced when he fell under the Nervina's\r\ncharm. I knew as I watched the stranger's wondering, puzzled features,\r\nthat I had never before seen anyone so lovely, so attractive, and so\r\nutterly beyond suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that I noted her amazingly delicate complexion, fair\r\nas her hair was golden; her deep blue eyes, round face, and the girlish\r\nsupple figure; or her robe-like garments of very soft, white material.\r\nFor she commenced almost instantly to talk.\r\n\r\nBut we understood only with the greatest of difficulty. She spoke as\r\nmight one who, after living in perfect solitude for a score of years, is\r\nsuddenly called upon to use language. And I remembered that Rhamda Avec\r\nhad told Jerome that he had only BEGUN the use of language.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” was her first remark, in the sweetest voice conceivable.\r\nBut there was both fear and anxiety in her manner. “How--did\r\nI--get--here?”\r\n\r\n“You came out of the Blind Spot!” I spoke, jerking out the words\r\nnervously and, as I saw, too rapidly. I repeated them more slowly. But\r\nshe did not comprehend.\r\n\r\n“The--Blind--Spot,” she pondered. “What--is that?”\r\n\r\nNext instant, before I could think to warn her, the room trembled with\r\nthe terrific clang of the Blind Spot bell. Just one overwhelming peal;\r\nno more. At the same time there came a revival of the luminous spot in\r\nthe ceiling. But, with the last tones of the bell, the spot faded to\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThe girl was pitifully frightened. I sprang to my feet and steadied her\r\nwith one hand--something that I had not dared to do as long as the Spot\r\nremained open. The touch of my fingers, as she swayed, had the effect of\r\nbringing her to herself. She listened intelligently to what I said.\r\n\r\n“The Blind Spot”--speaking with the utmost care--“is the name we have\r\ngiven to a certain mystery. It is always marked by the sound you have\r\njust heard; that bell always rings when the phenomenon is at an end.”\r\n\r\n“And--the--phenomenon,” uttering the word with difficulty, “what is\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“You,” I returned. “Up till now three human beings have disappeared into\r\nwhat we call the Blind Spot. You are the first to be seen coming out of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Hobart,” interrupted Charlotte, coming to my side. “Let me.”\r\n\r\nI stepped back, and Charlotte quietly passed an arm round the girl's\r\nwaist. Together they stepped over to Charlotte's chair.\r\n\r\nI noted the odd way in which the newcomer walked, unsteadily,\r\nuncertainly, like a child taking its first steps. I glanced at Jerome,\r\nwondering if this tallied with what he recalled of the Rhamda; and he\r\ngave a short nod.\r\n\r\n“Don't be frightened,” said Charlotte softly, “we are your friends. In\r\na way we have been expecting you, and we shall see to it that no harm\r\ncomes to you.\r\n\r\n“Which would you prefer--to ask questions, or to answer them?”\r\n\r\n“I”--the girl hesitated--“I--hardly--know. Perhaps--you had--better--ask\r\nsomething first.”\r\n\r\n“Good. Do you remember where you came from? Can you recall the events\r\njust prior to your arrival here?”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked helplessly from the one to the other of us. She seemed\r\nto be searching for some clue. Finally she shook her head in a hopeless,\r\ndespairing fashion.\r\n\r\n“I can't remember,” speaking with a shade less difficulty. “The last\r\nthing--I recall is--seeing--you three--staring--at me.”\r\n\r\nThis was a poser. To think, a person who, before our very eyes, had\r\nmaterialised out of the Blind Spot, was unable to tell us anything about\r\nit!\r\n\r\nStill this lack of memory might be only a temporary condition,\r\nbrought on by the special conditions under which she had emerged; an\r\nafter-effect, as it were, of the semi-electrical phenomena. And it\r\nturned out that I was right.\r\n\r\n“Then,” suggested Charlotte, “suppose you ask us something.”\r\n\r\nThe girl's eyes stopped roving and rested definitely, steadily, upon my\r\nown. And she spoke; still a little hesitantly:\r\n\r\n“Who are you? What is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Name?” taken wholly by surprise. “Ah--it is Hobart Fenton.\r\nAnd”--automatically--“this is my sister Charlotte. The gentleman over\r\nthere is Mr. Jerome.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to know you, Hobart,” with perfect simplicity and apparent\r\npleasure; “and you, Charlotte,” passing an arm round my sister's neck;\r\n“and you--Mister.” Evidently she thought the title of “mister” to be\r\nJerome's first name.\r\n\r\nThen she went on to say, her eyes coming back to mine:\r\n\r\n“Why do you look at me that way, Hobart?”\r\n\r\nJust like that! I felt my cheeks go hot and cold by turns. For a moment\r\nI was helpless; then I made up my mind to be just as frank and candid as\r\nshe.\r\n\r\n“Because you're so good to look at!” I blurted out. “I never appreciated\r\nmy eyesight as I do right now!”\r\n\r\n“I am glad,” she returned, simply and absolutely without a trace\r\nof confusion or resentment. “I know that I rather like to look at\r\nyou--too.”\r\n\r\nAnother stunned silence. And this time I didn't notice any change in the\r\ntemperature of my face; I was too busily engaged in searching the depths\r\nof those warm blue eyes.\r\n\r\nShe didn't blush, or even drop her eyes. She smiled, however, a gentle,\r\ntremulous smile that showed some deep feeling behind her unwavering\r\ngaze.\r\n\r\nI recovered myself with a start, drew my chair up in front of her and\r\ntook both her hands firmly in mine. Whereupon my resolution nearly\r\ndeserted me. How warm and soft, and altogether adorable they were. I\r\ndrew a long breath and began:\r\n\r\n“My dear--By the way, what is your name?”\r\n\r\n“I”--regretfully, after a moment's thought--“I don't know, Hobart.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” as though the fact was commonplace. “We will have to provide\r\nyou with a name. Any suggestions?”\r\n\r\nCharlotte hesitated only a second. “Let's call her Ariadne; it was\r\nHarry's mother's name.”\r\n\r\n“That's so; fine! Do you like the name--Ariadne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” both pleased and relieved. At the same time she looked oddly\r\npuzzled, and I could see her lips moving silently as she repeated the\r\nname to herself.\r\n\r\nNot for an instant did I let go of those wonderful fingers. “What I\r\nwant you to know, Ariadne, is that you have come into a world that is,\r\nperhaps, more or less like the one that you have just left. For all\r\nI know it is one and the same world, only, in some fashion not yet\r\nunderstood, you may have transported yourself to this place. Perhaps\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n“Now, we call this a room, a part of the house. Outside is a street.\r\nThat street is one of hundreds in a vast city, which consists of\r\na multitude of such houses together with other and vastly larger\r\nstructures. And these structures all rest upon a solid material which we\r\ncall the ground or earth.\r\n\r\n“The fact that you understand our language indicates that either you\r\nhave fallen heir to a body and a brain which are thoroughly in tune with\r\nours, or else--and please understand that we know very little of this\r\nmystery--or else your own body has somehow become translated into a\r\ncondition which answers the same purpose.\r\n\r\n“At any rate, you ought to comprehend what I mean by the term 'earth.'\r\nDo you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” brightly. “I seem to understand everything you say, Hobart.”\r\n\r\n“Then there is a corresponding picture in your mind to each thought I\r\nhave given you?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” not so positively.\r\n\r\n“Well,” hoping that I could make it clear, “this earth is formed in a\r\nhuge globe, part of which is covered by another material, which we term\r\nwater. And the portions which are not so covered, and are capable of\r\nsupporting the structures which constitute the city, we call by still\r\nanother name. Can you supply that name?”\r\n\r\n“Continents,” without hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Fine!” This was a starter anyhow. “We'll soon have your memory working!\r\n\r\n“However, what I really began to say is this; each of these\r\ncontinents--and they are several in number--is inhabited by people more\r\nor less like ourselves. There is a vast number, all told. Each is either\r\nmale or female, like ourselves--you seem to take this for granted,\r\nhowever--and you will find them all exceedingly interesting.\r\n\r\n“Now, in all fairness,” letting go her hands at last “you must\r\nunderstand that there are, among the people whom you have yet to see,\r\ngreat numbers who are far more--well, attractive, than I am.\r\n\r\n“And you must know,” even taking my gaze away, “that not all persons are\r\nas friendly as we. You will find some who are antagonistic to you, and\r\nlikely to take advantage of--well, your unsophisticated viewpoint. In\r\nshort”--desperately--“you must learn right away not to accept people\r\nwithout question; you must form the habit of reserving judgment, of\r\nwaiting until you have more facts, before reaching an opinion of others.\r\n\r\n“You must do this as a matter of self-protection, and in the interests\r\nof your greatest welfare.”\r\n\r\nAnd I stopped.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to be thinking over what I said. In the end she observed:\r\n“This seems reasonable. I feel sure that wherever I came from such\r\nadvice would have fitted.\r\n\r\n“However”--smiling at me in a manner to which I can give no description\r\nother than affectionate--“I have no doubts about you, Hobart. I know you\r\nare absolutely all right.”\r\n\r\nAnd before I could recover from the bliss into which her statement threw\r\nme, she turned to Charlotte with “You too, Charlotte; I know I can trust\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nBut when she looked at Jerome she commented: “I can trust you, Mister,\r\ntoo; almost as much, but not quite. If you didn't suspect me I could\r\ntrust you completely.”\r\n\r\nJerome went white. He spoke for the first time since the girl's coming.\r\n\r\n“How--how did you know that I suspected you?”\r\n\r\n“I can't explain; I don't know myself.” Then wistfully: “I wish you\r\nwould stop suspecting me, Mister. I have nothing to conceal from you.”\r\n\r\n“I know it!” Jerome burst out, excitedly, apologetically. “I know it\r\nnow! You're all right, I'm satisfied of that from now on!”\r\n\r\nShe sighed in pure pleasure. And she offered one hand to Jerome. He took\r\nit as though it were a humming-bird's egg, and turned almost purple. At\r\nthe same time the honest, fervid manliness which backed the detective's\r\nprofessional nature shone through for the first time in my knowledge of\r\nhim. From that moment his devotion to the girl was as absolute as that\r\nof the fondest father who ever lived.\r\n\r\nWell, no need to detail all that was said during the next hour. Bit by\r\nbit we added to the girl's knowledge of the world into which she had\r\nemerged, and bit by bit there unfolded in her mind a corresponding image\r\nof the world from which she had come. And when, for an experiment, we\r\ntook her out on the front porch and showed her the stars, we were fairly\r\namazed at the thoughts they aroused.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she cried, in sheer rapture. “I know what those are!” By now she\r\nwas speaking fairly well. “They are stars!” Then: “They don't look the\r\nsame. They're not outlined in the same way as I know. But they can't be\r\nanything else!”\r\n\r\nNOT OUTLINED THE SAME. I took this to be a very significant fact. What\r\ndid it mean?\r\n\r\n“Look”--showing her the constellation Leo, on the ecliptic, and\r\ntherefore visible to both the northern and southern hemispheres--“do you\r\nrecognise that?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” decisively. “That is, the arrangement; but not the appearance of\r\nthe separate stars.”\r\n\r\nAnd we found this to be true of the entire sky. Nothing was entirely\r\nfamiliar to her; yet, she assured us, the stars could be nothing else.\r\nHer previous knowledge told her this without explaining why, and without\r\na hint as to the reason for the dissimilarity.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” said I, speaking half to myself, “that she has come\r\nfrom another planet?”\r\n\r\nFor we know that the sky, as seen from any of the eight planets in this\r\nsolar system, would present practically the same appearance; but if\r\nviewed from a planet belonging to any other star-sun, the constellations\r\nwould be more or less altered in their arrangement, because of the\r\nvast distance involved. As for the difference in the appearance of the\r\nindividual stars, that might be accounted for by a dissimilarity in the\r\nchemical make-up of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n“Ariadne, it may be you've come from another world!”\r\n\r\n“No,” seemingly quite conscious that she was contradicting me. For that\r\nmatter there wasn't anything offensive about her kind of frankness. “No,\r\nHobart. I feel too much at home to have come from any other world than\r\nthis one.”\r\n\r\nTemporarily I was floored. How could she, so ignorant of other matters,\r\nfeel so sure of this? There was no explaining it.\r\n\r\nWe went back into the house. As it happened, my eye struck first the\r\ngramophone. And it seemed a good idea to test her knowledge with this.\r\n\r\n“Is this apparatus familiar to you?”\r\n\r\n“No. What is it for?”\r\n\r\n“Do you understand what is meant by the term 'music'?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” with instant pleasure. “This is music.” She proceeded, without\r\nthe slightest self-consciousness, to sing in a sweet clear soprano, and\r\ntreated us to the chorus of “I Am Climbing Mountains!”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!” gasped Charlotte. “What can it mean?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the explanation evaded me. Then I reasoned: “She must\r\nhave a sub-conscious memory of what was being played just before she\r\nmaterialised.”\r\n\r\nAnd to prove this I picked out an instrumental piece which we had not\r\nplayed all the evening. It was the finale of the overture to “Faust”; a\r\nselection, by the way, which was a great favourite of Harry's and is one\r\nof mine. Ariadne listened in silence to the end.\r\n\r\n“I seem to have heard something like it before,” she decided slowly.\r\n“The melody, not the--the instrumentation. But it reminds me of\r\nsomething that I like very much.” Whereupon she began to sing for us.\r\nBut this time her voice was stronger and more dramatic; and as for the\r\ncomposition--all I can say is it had a wild, fierce ring to it, like\r\n“Men of Harlech”; only the notes did not correspond to the chromatic\r\nscale. SHE SANG IN AN ENTIRELY NEW MUSICAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n“By George!” when she had done. “Now we HAVE got something! For the\r\nfirst time, we've heard some genuine, unadulterated Blind Spot stuff!”\r\n\r\n“You mean,” from Charlotte, excitedly, “that she has finally recovered\r\nher memory?”\r\n\r\nIt was the girl herself who answered. She shot to her feet, and her face\r\nbecame transfigured with a wonderful joy. At the same time she blinked\r\nhurriedly, as though to shut off a sight that staggered her.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I remember!”--she almost sobbed in her delight--“it is all plain\r\nto me, now! I know who I am!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE RHAMDA AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nI could have yelled for joy. We were about to learn something of the\r\nBlind Spot--something that might help us to save Harry, and Chick, and\r\nthe professor!\r\n\r\nAriadne seemed to know that a great deal depended upon what she was\r\nabout to tell us. She deliberately sat down, and rested her chin upon\r\nher hand, as though determining upon the best way of telling something\r\nvery difficult to express.\r\n\r\nAs for Charlotte, Jerry, and myself, we managed somehow to restrain our\r\ncuriosity enough to keep silence. But we could not help glancing more or\r\nless wonderingly at our visitor. Presently I realised this, and got up\r\nand walked quietly about, as though intent upon a problem of my own.\r\n\r\nWhich was true enough. I had come to a very startling conclusion--I,\r\nHobart Fenton, had fallen in love!\r\n\r\nWhat was more, this affection of the heart had come to me, a very strong\r\nman, just as an affection of the lungs is said to strike such men--all\r\nof a sudden and hard. One moment I had been a sturdy, independent soul,\r\nintent upon scientific investigation, the only symptoms of sentimental\r\npotentialities being my perfectly normal love for my sister and for my\r\nold friend. Then, before my very eyes, I had been smitten thus!\r\n\r\nAnd the worst part of it was, I found myself ENJOYING the sensation. It\r\nmade not the slightest difference to me that I had fallen in love with\r\na girl who was only a step removed from a wraith. Mysteriously she had\r\ncome to me; as mysteriously she might depart. I had yet to know from\r\nwhat sort of country she had come!\r\n\r\nBut that made no difference. She was HERE, in the same house with me;\r\nI had held her hands; and I knew her to be very, very real indeed just\r\nthen. And when I considered the possibility of her disappearing just as\r\ninexplicably as she had come--well, my face went cold, I admit. But at\r\nthe same time I felt sure of this much--I should never love any other\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe thought left me sober. I paused in my pacing and looked at her. As\r\nthough in answer to my gaze she glanced up and smiled so affectionately\r\nthat it was all I could do to keep from leaping forward and taking her\r\nright into my arms.\r\n\r\nI turned hastily, and to cover my confusion I began to hum a strain from\r\nthe part of “Faust” to which I have referred. I hummed it through, and\r\nwas beginning again, when I was startled to hear this from the girl:\r\n“Oh, then you are Hobart!”\r\n\r\nI wheeled, to see her face filled with a wonderful light.\r\n\r\n“Hobart,” she repeated, as one might repeat the name of a very dear one.\r\n“That--that music you were humming! Why, I heard Harry Wendel humming\r\nthat yesterday!”\r\n\r\nI suppose we looked very stupid, the three of us, so dumbfounded that we\r\ncould do nothing but gape incredulously at that extraordinary creature\r\nand her equally extraordinary utterance. She immediately did her best to\r\natone for her sensation.\r\n\r\n“I'm not sure that I can make it clear,” she said, smiling dubiously,\r\n“but if you will use your imaginations and try to fill in the gaps in\r\nwhat I say you may get a fair idea of the place I have come from, and\r\nwhere Harry is.”\r\n\r\nWe leaned forward, intensely alert. I shall never forget the pitiful\r\neagerness in poor Charlotte's face. It meant more to her, perhaps, than\r\nto anyone else.\r\n\r\nAt the precise instant I heard a sound, off in the breakfast room. It\r\nseemed to be a subdued knocking, or rather a pounding at the door.\r\n\r\nFrowning at the interruption, I stepped through the dining-room into\r\nthe breakfast room, where the sounds came from. And I was not a little\r\npuzzled to note that the door to the basement was receiving the blows.\r\n\r\nNow I had been the last to visit the basement and had locked the\r\ndoor--from force of habit, I suppose--leaving the key in the lock.\r\nIt was still there. And there is but one way to enter that basement:\r\nthrough this one door, and no other.\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” I called out peremptorily. No answer; only a repetition of\r\nthe pounds.\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”--louder.\r\n\r\n“Open this door, quick!” cane a muffled reply.\r\n\r\nThe voice was unrecognisable. I stood and thought quickly; then shouted:\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, until I get a key!”\r\n\r\nI motioned to Charlotte. She tip-toed to my side. I whispered something\r\nin her ear; and she slipped off into the kitchen, there to phone Miss\r\nClarke and warn her to notify her colleagues at once. And so, as I\r\nunlocked the door, I was fortified by the knowledge that I would be\r\nassisted by the combined mind-force of a score of highly developed\r\nintellects.\r\n\r\nI was little surprised, a second later, to see that the intruder was\r\nRhamda Avec. What reason to expect anyone else?\r\n\r\n“How did you get down there?” I demanded. “Don't you realise that you\r\nare liable to arrest for trespass?”\r\n\r\nI said it merely to start conversation but it served only to bring a\r\nslight smile to the face of this professed friend of ours, for whom we\r\nfelt nothing but distrust and fear.\r\n\r\n“Let us not waste time in trivialities, Fenton,” he rejoined gently. He\r\nbrushed a fleck of cobweb from his coat. “By this time you ought to know\r\nthat you cannot deal with me in any ordinary fashion.”\r\n\r\nI made no comment as, without asking my leave or awaiting an invitation,\r\nhe stepped through into the dining-room and thence into the parlour. I\r\nfollowed, half tempted to strike him down from behind, but restrained\r\nmore by the fact that I must spare him than from any compunctions.\r\nSeemingly he knew this as well as I, he was serenely at ease.\r\n\r\nAnd thus he stood before Jerome and Ariadne. The detective made a single\r\nexclamation, and furtively shifted his coat sleeves. He was getting that\r\ninfernal breast gun into action. As for Ariadne, she stared at the new\r\narrival as though astonished at first.\r\n\r\nWhen Charlotte returned, a moment later, she showed only mild surprise.\r\nShe quietly took her chair and as quietly moved her hand so that the gem\r\nshone in full view of our visitor.\r\n\r\nBut he gave her and the stone only a single glance, and then rested his\r\neyes upon our new friend. To my anxiety, Ariadne was gazing fixedly at\r\nhim now, her expression combining both agitation and a vague fear.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been due entirely to his unusual appearance; for\r\nthere was no denying that this grey-haired yet young-faced man with the\r\ndistinguished, courteous bearing, looked even younger that night than\r\never before. No; the girl's concern was deeper, more acute. I felt an\r\nunaccountable alarm.\r\n\r\nFrom Ariadne to me the Rhamda glanced, then back again; and a quick\r\nsatisfied smile came to his mouth. He gave an almost imperceptible nod.\r\nAnd, keeping his gaze fixed upon her eyes, he remarked carelessly:\r\n\r\n“Which of these chairs shall I sit in, Fenton?”\r\n\r\n“This one,” I replied instantly, pointing to the one I had just quit.\r\n\r\nSmiling, he selected a chair a few feet away.\r\n\r\nWhereupon I congratulated myself. The man feared me, then; yet he ranked\r\nmy mentality no higher than that! In other words, remarkably clever\r\nthough he might be, and as yet unthwarted, he could by no means be\r\ncalled omnipotent.\r\n\r\n“For your benefit, Mr. Jerome, let me say that I phoned Miss Fenton and\r\nher brother a few days ago, and urged them to give up their notion of\r\noccupying this house or of attempting to solve the mystery that you\r\nare already acquainted with. And I prophesied, Mr. Jerome, that their\r\nrefusal to accept my advice would be followed by events that would\r\njustify me.\r\n\r\n“They refused, as you know; and I am here tonight to make a final plea,\r\nso that they may escape the consequences of their wilfulness.”\r\n\r\n“You're a crook! And the more I see of you, Avec, the more easily I can\r\nunderstand why they turned you down!”\r\n\r\n“So you too, are prejudiced against me. I cannot understand this. My\r\nmotives are quite above question, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Really!” I observed sarcastically. I stole a glance at Ariadne; her\r\neyes were still riveted, in a rapt yet half-fearful abstraction, upon\r\nthe face of the Rhamda. It was time I took her attention away.\r\n\r\nI called her name. She did not move her head, or reply. I said it\r\nlouder: “Ariadne!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, Hobart?”--very softly.\r\n\r\n“Ariadne, this gentleman possesses a great deal of knowledge of the\r\nlocality from which you came. We are interested in him, because we feel\r\nsure that, if he chose to, he could tell us something about our friends\r\nwho--about Harry Wendel.” Why not lay the cards plainly on the table?\r\nThe Rhamda must be aware of it all, anyhow. “And as this man has said,\r\nhe has tried to prevent us from solving the mystery. It occurs to me,\r\nAriadne, that you might recognise this man. But apparently--”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head just perceptibly. I proceeded:\r\n\r\n“He is pleased to call his warning a prophecy; but we feel that a threat\r\nis a threat. What he really wants is that ring.”\r\n\r\nAriadne had already, earlier in the hour, given the gem several curious\r\nglances. Now she stirred and sighed, and was about to turn her eyes\r\nfrom the Rhamda to the ring when he spoke again; this time in a voice as\r\nsharp as a steel blade:\r\n\r\n“I do not enjoy being misunderstood, much less being misrepresented, Mr.\r\nFenton. At the same time, since you have seen fit to brand me in such\r\nuncomplimentary terms, suppose I state what I have to say very bluntly,\r\nso that there may be no mistake about it. If you do not either quit this\r\nhouse, or give up the ring--NOW--you will surely regret it the rest of\r\nyour lives!”\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of my eye I saw Jerome moving slowly in his chair, so\r\nthat he could face directly towards the Rhamda. His hands were ready for\r\nthe swift, upward jerk which, I knew, would stifle our caller.\r\n\r\nAs for my sister, she merely turned the ring so that the gem no longer\r\nfaced the Rhamda; and with the other hand she reached out and grasped\r\nAriadne's firmly.\r\n\r\nAvec sat with his two hands clasping the arms of his chair. His fingers\r\ndrummed nervously but lightly on the wood. And then, suddenly, they\r\nstopped their motion.\r\n\r\n“Your answer, Fenton,” in his usual gentle voice. “I can give you no\r\nmore time,” I did not need to consult Charlotte or Jerome. I knew what\r\nthey would have said.\r\n\r\n“You are welcome to my answer. It is--no!”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke the last word my gaze was fixed on the Rhamda's eyes. He, on\r\nthe other hand, was looking towards Ariadne. And at the very instant an\r\nexpression, as of alarm and sorrow, swept into the man's face.\r\n\r\nMy glance jumped to Ariadne. Her eyes were closed, her face suffused;\r\nshe seemed to be suffocating. She gave a queer little sound, half gasp\r\nand half cry.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously Jerome's hands shot into the air. The room shivered\r\nwith the stunning report of his breast gun. And every pellet struck the\r\nRhamda and burst.\r\n\r\nA look of intense astonishment came into his face. He gave Jerome a\r\nfleeting glance, almost of admiration; then his nostrils contracted with\r\npain as the gas attacked his lungs.\r\n\r\nAnother second, and each of us were reeling with the fumes. Jerome\r\nstarted toward the window, to raise it, then sank back into his chair.\r\nAnd when he turned round--\r\n\r\nHe and I and Charlotte saw an extraordinary thing. Instead of succumbing\r\nto the gas, Rhamda Avec somehow recovered himself. And while the rest\r\nof us remained still too numbed to move or speak, he found power to do\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n“I warned you plainly, Fenton,” as though nothing in particular had\r\nhappened. “And now see what you have brought upon the poor child!”\r\n\r\nI could only roll my head stupidly, to stare at Ariadne's now senseless\r\nform.\r\n\r\n“As usual, Fenton, you will blame me for it. I cannot help that. But it\r\nmay still be possible for you to repent of your folly and escape your\r\nfate. You are playing with terrible forces. If you do repent, just\r\nfollow these instructions”--laying a card on the table--“and I will see\r\nwhat I can do for you. I wish you all good night.”\r\n\r\nAnd with that, pausing only to make a courtly bow to Charlotte, Rhamda\r\nAvec turned and walked deliberately, dignifiedly from the room, while\r\nthe two men and a woman stared helplessly after him and allowed him to\r\ngo in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE LIVING DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fresh air had revived us somewhat, we first of all\r\nexamined Ariadne. She still lay unconscious, very pale, and alarmingly\r\nlimp. I picked her up and carried her into the next room, where\r\nthere was a sofa, while Jerome went for water and Charlotte brought\r\nsmelling-salts.\r\n\r\nNeither of these had any effect. Ariadne seemed to be scarcely\r\nbreathing; her heart beat only faintly, and there was no response to\r\nsuch other methods as friction, slapping, or pinching of fingernails.\r\n\r\n“We had better call a doctor,” decided Charlotte promptly, and went to\r\nthe phone.\r\n\r\nI picked up the card which the Rhamda had left. It contained simply his\r\nname, together with one other word--the name of a morning newspaper.\r\nEvidently he meant for us to insert an advertisement as soon as we were\r\nready to capitulate.\r\n\r\n“Not yet!” the three of us decided, after talking it over. And we waited\r\nas patiently as we could during the fifteen minutes that elapsed before\r\nthe telephoning got results.\r\n\r\nIt brought Dr. Hansen, who, it may be remembered, was closely identified\r\nwith the Chick Watson disappearance. He made a rapid but very careful\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n“It has all the appearance of a mild electric shock. What caused it,\r\nFenton?”\r\n\r\nI told him. His eyes narrowed when I mentioned Avec, then widened in\r\nastonishment and incredulity as I related the man's inexplicable effect\r\nupon the girl, and his strange immunity to the poison gas. But the\r\ndoctor asked nothing further about our situation, proceeding at once to\r\napply several restoratives. All were without result. As a final resort,\r\nhe even rigged up an electrical connection, making use of some coils\r\nwhich I had upstairs, and endeavoured to arouse the girl in that\r\nfashion. Still without result.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, Hansen!” I finally burst out, when he stood back, apparently\r\nbaffled. “She's simply GOT to be revived! We can't allow her to succumb\r\nto that scoundrel's power, whatever it is!”\r\n\r\n“Why not a blood transfusion?” I asked eagerly, as an idea came to me.\r\n“I'm in perfect condition. What about it? Go to it, doc!”\r\n\r\nHe slowly shook his head. And beyond a single searching glance into\r\nmy eyes, wherein he must have read something more than I had said, he\r\nregretfully replied:\r\n\r\n“This is a case for a specialist, Fenton. Everything considered, I\r\nshould say that she is suffering from a purely mental condition; but\r\nwhether it had a physical or a psychic origin, I can't say.”\r\n\r\nIn short, he did not feel safe about going ahead with any really heroic\r\nmeasures until a brain specialist was called in.\r\n\r\nI had a good deal of confidence in Hansen. And what he said sounded\r\nreasonable. So we agreed to his calling in a Dr. Higgins--the same man,\r\nin fact, who was too late in reaching the house to save Chick on that\r\nmemorable night a year before.\r\n\r\nHis examination was swift and convincingly competent. He went over the\r\nsame ground that Hansen had covered, took the blood pressure and other\r\ninstrumental data, and asked us several questions regarding Ariadne's\r\nmentality as we knew it. Scarcely stopping to think it over, Higgins\r\ndecided:\r\n\r\n“The young woman is suffering from a temporary dissociation of brain\r\ncentres. Her cerebrum does not co-act with her cerebellum. In other\r\nwords, her conscious mind, for lack of means to express itself, is for\r\nthe time being dormant as in sleep.\r\n\r\n“But it is not like ordinary sleep. Such is induced by fatigue of the\r\nnerve channels. This young woman's condition is produced by shock; and\r\nsince there was no physical violence, we must conclude that the shock\r\nwas psychic.\r\n\r\n“In that case, the condition will last until one of two things occurs;\r\neither she must be similarly shocked back into sensibility--and I can't\r\nsee how this can happen, Fenton, unless you can secure the co-operation\r\nof the man to whom you attribute the matter--or she must lie that way\r\nindefinitely.”\r\n\r\n“Indefinitely!” I exclaimed, sensing something ominous. “You mean--”\r\n\r\n“That there is no known method of reviving a patient in such a\r\ncondition. It might be called psychic catalepsy. To speak plainly,\r\nFenton, unless this man revives her, she will remain unconscious until\r\nher death.”\r\n\r\nI shuddered. What horrible thing had come into our lives to afflict us\r\nwith so dreadful a prospect?\r\n\r\n“Is--is there no hope, Dr. Higgins?”\r\n\r\n“Very little”--gently but decisively. “All I can assure you is that she\r\nwill not die immediately. From the general state of her health, she will\r\nlive at least seventy-two hours. After that--you must be prepared for\r\nthe worst at any moment.”\r\n\r\nI turned away quickly, so that he could not see my face. What an awful\r\nsituation! Unless we could somehow lay hands on the Rhamda--\r\n\r\nI hunted up Jerome. I said:\r\n\r\n“Jerry, the thing is plainly up to you and me. Higgins gives us three\r\ndays. Day after tomorrow morning, if we haven't got results by that\r\ntime, we've got to give in and put that ad in the paper. But I\r\ndon't mean to give in, Jerry! Not until I've exhausted every other\r\npossibility!”\r\n\r\n“What're you going to do?” he asked thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“Work on that ring. I was a fool not to get busy sooner. As for the\r\nrest, that's up to you! You've got to get yourself on the Rhamda's trail\r\nas soon as you can, and camp there! The first chance you get, ransack\r\nhis room and belongings, and bring me every bit of data you find.\r\nBetween him and the ring, the truth ought to come out.”\r\n\r\n“All right. But don't forget that--” pointing to the unexplained spot\r\non the wood of the doorway. “You've got a mighty important clue there,\r\nwaiting for you to analyse it.”\r\n\r\nAnd he went and got his hat, and left the house. His final remark was\r\nthat we wouldn't see him back until he had something to report about our\r\nman.\r\n\r\nFive o'clock the next morning found my sister and me out of our beds and\r\ndesperately busy. She spent a good deal of time, of course in caring for\r\nAriadne. The poor girl showed no improvement at all; and we got scant\r\nencouragement from the fact that she looked no worse.\r\n\r\nNot a sound escaped her lips; her eyes remained closed; she gave no sign\r\nof life, save her barely perceptible breathing. It made me sick at heart\r\njust to look at her; so near, and yet so fearfully far away.\r\n\r\nBut when Charlotte could spare any time she gave me considerable help in\r\nwhat I was trying to do. One great service she was rendering has already\r\nbeen made clear: she wore the ring constantly, thus relieving me of\r\nthe anxiety of caring for it. I was very cautious not to have it in my\r\npossession for more than a few minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nMy first move was to set down, in orderly fashion, the list of the gem's\r\nattributes. I grouped together the fluctuating nature of its pale blue\r\ncolour, its power of reproducing those who had gone into the Blind Spot,\r\nits combination of perfect solidity with extreme lightness; its quality\r\nof coldness to the touch of a male, and warmth to that of a female; and\r\nfinally its ability to induct--I think this is the right term--to induct\r\nsounds out of the unknown. This last quality might be called spasmodic\r\nor accidental, whereas the others were permanent and constant.\r\n\r\nNow, to this list I presently was able to add that the gem possessed no\r\nradioactive properties that I could detect with the usual means. It was\r\nonly when I began dabbling in chemistry that I learned things.\r\n\r\nBy placing the gem inside a glass bell, and exhausting as much air as\r\npossible from around it, the way was cleared for introducing other forms\r\nof gases. Whereupon I discovered this:\r\n\r\nThe stone will absorb any given quantity of hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nIn this respect it behaves analogously to that curious place on\r\nthe door-frame. Only, it absorbs gas, no liquid; and not any gas,\r\neither--none but hydrogen.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously this gem cannot truly absorb so much material, in the\r\nsense of retaining it as well. The simple test of weighing it afterwards\r\nproves this; for its weight remains the same in any circumstances.\r\n\r\nMoreover, unlike the liquids which I poured into the wood and saw\r\nafterwards in the basement, the gas does not escape back into the air. I\r\nkept it under the Dell long enough to be sure of that. No; that hydrogen\r\nis, manifestly, translated into the Blind Spot.\r\n\r\nLearning nothing further about the gem at that time, I proceeded to\r\ninvestigate the trim of the door. I began by trying to find out the\r\nprecise thickness of that liquid-absorbing layer.\r\n\r\nTo do this I scraped off the “skin” of the air-darkened wood. This layer\r\nwas .02 of an inch thick. And--that was the total amount of the active\r\nmaterial!\r\n\r\nI put these scrapings through a long list of experiments. They told\r\nme nothing valuable. I learned only one detail worth mentioning; if a\r\nfragment of the scrapings be brought near to the Holcomb gem--say, to\r\nwithin two inches--the scrapings will burst into flame. It is merely\r\na bright, pinkish flare, like that made by smokeless rifle-powder. No\r\nashes remain. After that we took care not to bring the ring near the\r\nremaining material on the board.\r\n\r\nAll this occurred on the first day after Ariadne was stricken. Jerome\r\nphoned to say that he had engaged the services of a dozen private\r\ndetectives, and expected to get wind of the Rhamda any hour. Both Dr.\r\nHansen and Dr. Higgins called twice, without being able to detect any\r\nchange for the better or otherwise in their patient.\r\n\r\nThat evening Charlotte and I concluded that we could not hold out any\r\nlonger. We must give in to the Rhamda. I phoned for a messenger, and\r\nsent an advertisement to the newspaper which Avec had indicated.\r\n\r\nThe thing was done. We had capitulated.\r\n\r\nThe next development would be another and triumphant call from the\r\nRhamda, and this time we would have to give up the gem to him if we were\r\nto save Ariadne.\r\n\r\nThe game was up.\r\n\r\nBut instead of taking the matter philosophically, I worried about it all\r\nnight. I told myself again and again that I was foolish to think about\r\nsomething that couldn't be helped. Why not forget it, and go to sleep?\r\n\r\nBut somehow I couldn't. I lay wide awake till long past midnight,\r\nfinding myself growing more and more nervous. At last, such was the\r\ntension of it all, I got up and dressed. It was then about one-thirty,\r\nand I stepped out on the street for a walk.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later I returned, my lungs full of fresh air, hoping that I\r\ncould now sleep. It was only a hope. Never have I felt wider awake than\r\nI did then.\r\n\r\nOnce more--about three--I took another stroll outside. I seemed\r\nabsolutely tireless.\r\n\r\nEach time that I had turned back home I seemed to feel stronger than\r\never, more wakeful. Finally I dropped the idea altogether, went to the\r\nhouse, and left a note for Charlotte, then walked down to the waterfront\r\nand watched some ships taking advantage of the tide. Anything to pass\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened, that, about eight o'clock--breakfast time at 288\r\nChatterton Place--I returned to the house, and sat down at the table\r\nwith Charlotte. First, however, I opened the morning paper to read our\r\nlittle ad.\r\n\r\nIt was not there. It had not been printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nAT THE ELEVENTH HOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nI dropped the paper in dismay. Charlotte looked up, startled, gave me a\r\nsingle look, and turned pale,\r\n\r\n“What--what's the matter?” she stammered fearfully.\r\n\r\nI showed her. Then I ran to the phone. In a few seconds I was talking to\r\nthe very man who had taken the note from the messenger the day before.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I handed it in along with the rest,” he replied to my excited\r\nquery. Then--“Wait a minute,” said he; and a moment later added: “Say,\r\nMr. Fenton, I've made a mistake! Here's the darned ad on the counter; it\r\nmust have slipped under the blotter.”\r\n\r\nI went back and told Charlotte. We stared at one another blankly. Why\r\nin the name of all that was baffling had our ad “slipped” under that\r\nblotter? And what were we to do?\r\n\r\nThis was the second day!\r\n\r\nWell, we did what we could. We arranged for the insertion of the same\r\nnotice in each of the three afternoon papers. There would still be time\r\nfor the Rhamda to act, if he saw it.\r\n\r\nThe hours dragged by. Never did time pass more slowly; and yet, I\r\nbegrudged every one. So much for being absolutely helpless.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o'clock the next morning--that is to say, today; I am writing\r\nthis the same evening--the front door bell rang. Charlotte answered and\r\nin a moment came back with a card. It read:\r\n\r\nSIR HENRY HODGES\r\n\r\nI nearly upset the table in my excitement. I ran into the hall. Who\r\nwouldn't? Sir Henry Hodges! The English scientist about whom the whole\r\nworld was talking! The most gifted investigator of the day; the most\r\nwidely informed; of all men on the face of the globe, the best equipped,\r\nmentally, to explore the unknown! Without the slightest formality I\r\ngrabbed his hand and shook it until he smiled at my enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“My dear Sir Henry,” I told him, “I'm immensely glad to see you! The\r\ntruth is, I've been hoping you'd be interested in our case; but I didn't\r\nhave the nerve to bother you with it!”\r\n\r\n“And I,” he admitted in his quiet way, “have been longing to take a hand\r\nin it, ever since I first heard of Professor Holcomb's disappearance.\r\nDidn't like to offer myself; understood that the matter had been hushed\r\nup and--”\r\n\r\n“For the very simple reason,” I explained, “that there was nothing to be\r\ngained by publicity. If we had given the public the facts, we would have\r\nbeen swamped with volunteers to help us. I didn't know whom to confide\r\nin, Sir Henry; couldn't make up my mind. I only knew that one such man\r\nas yourself was just what I needed.”\r\n\r\nHe overlooked the compliment, and pulled out the newspaper from his\r\npocket. “Bought this a few minutes ago. Saw your ad, and jumped to the\r\nconclusion that matters had reached an acute stage. Let me have the\r\nwhole story, my boy, as briefly as you can.”\r\n\r\nHe already knew the published details. Also, he seemed to be\r\nacquainted--in some manner which puzzled me--with much that had not been\r\nprinted. I sketched the affair as quickly as I could, making it clear\r\nthat we were face to face with a crisis. When I wound up by saying that\r\nit was Dr. Higgins who gave Ariadne three days, ending about midnight,\r\nin which she might recover if we could secure Rhamda Avec, he said\r\nkindly:\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid you made a mistake, my boy, in not seeking some help. The\r\ngame has reached a point where you cannot have too many brains on your\r\nside. Time is short for reinforcements!”\r\n\r\nHe heartily approved of my course in enlisting the aid of Miss Clarke\r\nand her colleagues. “That is the sort of thing you need! People with\r\nmentality; plenty of intellectual force!” And he went on to make\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nAs a result, within an hour and a half our house was sheltering five\r\nmore persons.\r\n\r\nMiss Clarke has already been introduced. She was easily one of the ten\r\nmost advanced practitioners in her line. And she had the advantage of\r\na curiosity that was interested in everything odd, even though she\r\nlabelled it “non-existent.” She said it helped her faith in the real\r\ntruths to be conversant with the unreal.\r\n\r\nDr. Malloy was from the university, an out-and-out materialist, a\r\npsychologist who made life interesting for those who agreed with William\r\nJames. His investigations of abnormal psychology are world-acknowledged.\r\n\r\nMme. Le Fabre, we afterwards learned, had come from Versailles\r\nespecially to investigate the matter that was bothering us. She\r\npossessed no mediumistic properties of her own but was a staunch\r\nproponent of spiritualism, believing firmly in immortality and the\r\nomnipotence of “translated” souls.\r\n\r\nProfessor Herold is most widely known as the inventor of certain\r\napparatus connected with wireless. But he is also considered the West's\r\nmost advanced student of electrical and radio-active subjects.\r\n\r\nI was enormously glad to have this man's expert, high-tension knowledge\r\nright on tap.\r\n\r\nThe remaining member of the quintet which Sir Henry advised me to summon\r\nrequires a little explanation. Also, I am obliged to give him a name\r\nnot his own; for it is not often that brigadier-generals of the United\r\nStates army can openly lend their names to anything so far removed\r\napparently from militarism as the searching of the occult.\r\n\r\nYet we knew that this man possessed a power that few scientists have\r\ndeveloped; the power of co-ordination, of handling and balancing great\r\nfacts and forces, and of deciding promptly how best to meet any given\r\nsituation. Not that we looked for anything militaristic out of the Blind\r\nSpot; far from it. We merely knew not what to expect, which was exactly\r\nwhy we wanted to have him with us; his type of mind is, perhaps, the\r\nmost solidly comforting sort that any mystery-bound person can have at\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nBy the time these five had gathered, Jerome had neither returned\r\nnor telephoned. There was not the slightest trace of Rhamda Avec; no\r\nguessing as to whether he had seen the ad. It was then one o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon. Only six hours ago! It doesn't seem possible.\r\n\r\nSo there were eight of us--three women and five men--who went upstairs\r\nand quietly inspected the all but lifeless form of Ariadne and\r\nafterwards gathered in the library below.\r\n\r\nAll were thoroughly familiar with the situation. Miss Clarke calmly\r\ncommented to the effect that the entire Blind Spot affair was due wholly\r\nand simply to the cumulative effects of so many, many subjects; the\r\nresult, in other words, of error.\r\n\r\nDr. Malloy was equally outspoken in his announcement that he proposed\r\nto deal with the matter from the standpoint of psychic aberration. He\r\nmentioned dissociated personalities, group hypnosis, and so on. But he\r\ndeclared that he was open to conviction, and anxious to get any and all\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nSir Henry had a good deal of difficulty in getting Mme. Le Fabre to\r\ncommit herself. Probably she felt that, since Sir Henry had gone on\r\nrecord as being doubtful of the spiritistic explanation of psychic\r\nphenomena, she might get into a controversy with him. But in the end\r\nshe stated that she expected to find our little mystery simply a novel\r\nvariation on what was so familiar to her.\r\n\r\nAs might be supposed, General Hume had no opinion. He merely expressed\r\nhimself as being prepared to accept any sound theory, or portions of\r\nsuch theories as might be advanced, and arrive at a workable conclusion\r\ntherefrom. Which was exactly what we wanted of him.\r\n\r\nOf them all, Professor Herold showed the most enthusiasm. Perhaps this\r\nwas because, despite his attainments, he is still young. At any rate, he\r\nmade it clear that he was fully prepared to learn something entirely new\r\nin science. And he was almost eager to adjust his previous notions and\r\nfacts to the new discoveries.\r\n\r\nWhen all these various viewpoints had been cleared up, and we felt that\r\nwe understood each other, it was inevitable that we should look to Sir\r\nHenry to state his position. This one man combined a large amount of the\r\nvarious, specialised abilities for which the others were noted, and they\r\nall knew and respected him accordingly. Had he stood and theorised half\r\nthe afternoon, they would willingly have sat and listened. But instead\r\nhe glanced at his watch, and observed:\r\n\r\n“To me, the most important development of all was hearing the sound of a\r\ndog's bark coming from the ring. As I recall the details, the sound was\r\nemitted just after the gem had been submitted to considerable handling,\r\nfrom Miss Fenton's fingers to her brother's and back again. In other\r\nwords, it was subjected to a mixture of opposing animal magnetisms.\r\nSuppose we experiment further with it now.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte slipped the gem from her finger and passed it around. Each of\r\nus held it for a second or two; after which Charlotte clasped the ring\r\ntightly in her palm, while we all joined hands.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, broad daylight; the hour, shortly after one.\r\nScarcely had our hands completed the circuit than something happened.\r\n\r\nFrom out of Charlotte's closed hand there issued an entirely new sound.\r\nAt first it was so faint and fragmentary that only two of us heard it.\r\nThen it became stronger and more continuous, and presently we were all\r\ngazing at each other in wonderment.\r\n\r\nFor the sound was that of footsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nDIRECT FROM PARADISE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound was not like that of the walking of the human. Nor was it such\r\nas an animal would make. It was neither a thud nor a pattering, but more\r\nlike a scratching shuffle, such as reminded me of nothing that I had\r\never heard before.\r\n\r\nNext moment, however, there came another sort of sound, plainly audible\r\nabove the footsteps. This was a thin, musical chuckle which ended in a\r\ndeep, but faint, organ-like throb. It happened only once.\r\n\r\nImmediately it was followed by a steady clicking, such as might be made\r\nby gently striking a stick against the pavement; only sharper. This\r\nlasted a minute, during which the other sounds ceased.\r\n\r\nOnce more the footsteps. They were not very loud, but in the stillness\r\nof that room they all but resounded.\r\n\r\nPresently Charlotte could stand it no longer. She placed the ring on the\r\ntable, where it continued to emit those unplaceable sounds.\r\n\r\n“Well! Do--do you people,” stammered Dr. Malloy, “do you people all hear\r\nTHAT?”\r\n\r\nMiss Clarke's face was rather pale. But her mouth was firm. “It is\r\nnothing,” said she, with theosophical positiveness. “You must not\r\nbelieve it--it is not the truth of--”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” interrupted Sir Henry, “but this isn't something to argue\r\nabout! It is a reality; and the sooner we all admit it, the better.\r\nThere is a living creature of some kind making that sound!”\r\n\r\n“It is the spirit of some two-footed creature,” asserted Mme. Le Fabre,\r\nplainly at her ease. She was on familiar ground now. “If only we had a\r\nmedium!”\r\n\r\nAbruptly the sounds left the vicinity of the ring. At first we could\r\nnot locate their new position. Then Herold declared that they came\r\nfrom under the table; and presently we were all gathered on the floor,\r\nlistening to those odd little sounds, while the ring remained thirty\r\ninches above, on the top of the table!\r\n\r\nIt may be that the thing, whatever it was, did not care for such a\r\ncrowd. For shortly the shuffling ceased. And for a while we stared and\r\nlistened, scarcely breathing, trying to locate the new position.\r\n\r\nFinally we went back to our chairs. We had heard nothing further.\r\nNevertheless, we continued to keep silence, with our ears alert for\r\nanything more.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” whispered Charlotte all of a sudden. “Did you hear that?” And\r\nshe looked up toward the ceiling.\r\n\r\nIn a moment I caught the sound. It was exceedingly faint, like the\r\ndistant thrumming of a zither. Only it was a single note, which did\r\nnot rise and fall, although there seemed a continual variation in its\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly the other sounds came again, down under the table. This\r\ntime we remained in our seats and simply listened. And presently Sir\r\nHenry, referring to the ring, made this suggestion:\r\n\r\n“Suppose we seal it up, and see whether it inducts the sound then as\r\nwell as when exposed.”\r\n\r\nThis appealed to Herold very strongly; the others were agreeable; so I\r\nran upstairs to my room and secured a small screw-top metal canister,\r\nwhich I knew to be airtight. It was necessary to remove the stone from\r\nthe ring, in order to get it into the opening in the can. Presently this\r\nwas done; and while our invisible visitor continued his scratchy little\r\nwalking as before, I screwed the top of the can down as tightly as I\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nInstantly the footsteps halted.\r\n\r\nI unscrewed the top a trifle. As instantly the stepping was resumed.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Herold. “It's a question of radioactivity, then! Remember Le\r\nBon's experiments, Sir Henry?”\r\n\r\nBut Miss Clarke was sorely mystified by this simple matter, and herself\r\nrepeated the experiments. Equally puzzled was Mme. Le Fabre. According\r\nto her theory, a spirit wouldn't mind a little thing like a metal box.\r\nOf them all, Dr. Malloy was the least disturbed; so decidedly so that\r\nGeneral Hume eyed him quizzically.\r\n\r\n“Fine bunch of hallucinations, doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Almost commonplace,” retorted Malloy.\r\n\r\nPresently I mentioned that the Rhamda had come from the basement on the\r\nnight that Ariadne had materialised; and I showed that the only possible\r\nroute into the cellar was through the locked door in the breakfast\r\nroom, since the windows were all too small, and there was no other door.\r\nQuery: How had the Rhamda got there? Immediately they all became alert.\r\nAs Herold said:\r\n\r\n“One thing or the other is true; either there is something downstairs\r\nwhich has escaped you, Fenton, or else Avec is able to materialise in\r\nany place he chooses. Let's look!”\r\n\r\nWe all went down except Charlotte, who went upstairs to stay with\r\nAriadne. By turns, each of us held the ring. And as we unlocked the\r\nbasement door we noted that the invisible, walking creature had reached\r\nthere before us.\r\n\r\nDown the steps went those unseen little feet, jumping from one step to\r\nthe next just ahead of us all the way. When within three or four steps\r\nof the bottom, the creature made one leap do for them all.\r\n\r\nI had previously run an extension cord down into the basement, and both\r\ncompartments could now be lighted by powerful electric lamps. We gave\r\nthe place a quick examination.\r\n\r\n“What's all this newly turned earth mean?” inquired Sir Henry, pointing\r\nto the result of Jerome's efforts a few months before. And I explained\r\nhow he and Harry, on the chance the basement might contain some clue\r\nas to the localisation of the Blind Spot, had dug without result in the\r\nbluish clay.\r\n\r\nSir Henry picked up the spade, which had never been moved from where\r\nJerome had dropped it. And while I went on to tell about the pool of\r\nliquids, which for some unknown reason had not seeped into the soil\r\nsince forming there, the Englishman proceeded to dig vigorously into the\r\nheap I had mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe rest of us watched him thoughtfully. We remembered that Jerome's\r\ndigging had been done after Queen's disappearance. And the dog had\r\nvanished in the rear room, the one in which Chick and Dr. Holcomb had\r\nlast been seen. Now, when Jerome had dug the clay from the basement\r\nunder this, the dining-room, he had thrown it through the once concealed\r\nopening in the partition; had thrown the clay, that is, in a small heap\r\nunder the library. And--after Jerome had done this the phenomena had\r\noccurred in the library, not in the dining-room.\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” ejaculated General Hume, as I pointed this out. “This may be\r\nsomething more, you know, that mere coincidence!”\r\n\r\nSir Henry said nothing, but continued his spading. He paid attention to\r\nnothing save the heap that Jerome had formed. And with each spadeful he\r\nbent over and examined the clay very carefully.\r\n\r\nMiss Clarke and Mme. Le Fabre both remained very calm about it all.\r\nEach from her own viewpoint regarded the work as more or less a waste of\r\ntime. But I noticed that they did not take their eyes from the spade.\r\n\r\nSir Henry stopped to rest. “Let me,” offered Herold; and went on as the\r\nEnglishman had done, holding up each spadeful for inspection. And it was\r\nthus that we made a strange discovery.\r\n\r\nWe all saw it at the same time. Embedded in the bluish earth was a\r\nsmall, egg-shaped piece of light-coloured stone. And protruding from its\r\nupper surface was a tiny, blood-red pebble, no bigger than a good-sized\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nHerold thrust the point of his spade under the stone, to lift it up.\r\nWhereupon he gave a queer exclamation.\r\n\r\n“Well, that's funny!” holding the stone up in front of us. “That little\r\nthing's as heavy as--as--it's HEAVIER than lead!”\r\n\r\nSir Henry picked the stone off the spade. Immediately the material\r\ncrumbled in his hands, as though rotting, so that it left only the\r\nsmall, red pebble intact. Sir Henry weighed this thoughtfully in his\r\npalm, then without a word handed it around.\r\n\r\nWe all wondered at the pebble. It was most astonishingly heavy. As I\r\nsay, it was no bigger than a fair-sized shot, yet it was vastly heavier.\r\n\r\nAfterward we weighed it, upstairs, and found that the trifle weighed\r\nover half a pound. Considering its very small bulk, this worked out to\r\nbe a specific gravity of 192.6 or almost ten times as heavy as the same\r\nbulk of pure gold. And gold is heavy.\r\n\r\nInevitably we saw that there must be some connection between this\r\nunprecedentedly heavy speck of material and that lighter-than-air gem\r\nof mystery. For the time being we were careful to keep the two apart. As\r\nfor the unexplained footsteps, they were still slightly audible, as the\r\ninvisible creatures moved around the cellar.\r\n\r\nAt last we turned to go. I let the others lead the way. Thus I was\r\nthe last to approach the steps; and it was at that moment that I felt\r\nsomething brush against my foot.\r\n\r\nI stooped down. My hands collided with the thing that had touched me.\r\nAnd I found myself clutching--\r\n\r\nSomething invisible--something which, in that brilliant light, showed\r\nabsolutely nothing to my eyes. But my hands told me I was grasping a\r\nvery real thing, as real as my fingers themselves.\r\n\r\nI made some sort of incoherent exclamation. The others turned and peered\r\nat me.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” came Herold's excited voice.\r\n\r\n“I don't know!” I gasped. “Come here.”\r\n\r\nBut Sir Henry was the first to reach me. Next instant he, too, was\r\nfingering the tiny, unseen object. And such was his iron nerve and\r\nsuperior self-control, he identified it almost at once.\r\n\r\n“By the lord!”--softly. “Why, it's a small bird! Come here.”\r\n\r\nAnother second and they were all there. I was glad enough of it; for,\r\nlike a flash, with an unexpectedness that startles me even now as I\r\nthink of it--\r\n\r\nThe thing became visible. Right in my grasp, a little fluttering bird\r\ncame to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nSOLVED\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a tiny thing, and most amazingly beautiful. It could not have\r\nstood as high as a canary; and had its feathers been made of gleaming\r\nsilver they could not have been lovelier. And its black-plumed head, and\r\nlong, blossom-like tail, were such as no man on earth ever set eyes on.\r\n\r\nLike a flash it was gone. Not more than a half a second was this\r\nenchanting apparition visible to us. Before we could discern any more\r\nthan I have mentioned, it not only vanished but it ceased to make any\r\nsounds whatever. And each of us drew a long breath, as one might after\r\nbeing given a glimpse of an angel.\r\n\r\nRight now, five or six hours after the events I have just described, it\r\nis very easy for me to smile at my emotions of the time. How startled\r\nand mystified I was! And--why not confess it?--just a trifle afraid.\r\nWhy? Because I didn't understand! Merely that.\r\n\r\nAt this moment I sit in my laboratory upstairs in that house, rejoicing\r\nin having reached the end of the mystery. For the enigma of the Blind\r\nSpot is no more. I have solved it!\r\n\r\nNow twenty feet away, in another room, lies Ariadne. Already there is\r\na faint trace of colour in her cheeks, and her heart is beating more\r\nstrongly. Another hour, says Dr. Higgins, and she will be restored to\r\nus!\r\n\r\nThe time is seven p.m. I didn't sleep at all last night; I haven't slept\r\nsince. For the past five hours we have been working steadily on the\r\nmystery, ever since our finding that little, red pebble in the basement.\r\nThe last three hours of the time I have been treating Ariadne, using\r\nmeans which our discoveries indicated. And in order to keep awake I have\r\nbeen dictating this account to a stenographer.\r\n\r\nThis young lady, a Miss Dibble, is downstairs, where her typewriter will\r\nnot bother. Yes, put that down, too, Miss Dibble; I want people to know\r\neverything! She has a telephone clamped to her ears, and I am talking\r\ninto a microphone which is fixed to a stand on my desk.\r\n\r\nOn that desk are four switches. All are of the four-way two-pole type;\r\nand from them run several wires, some going to one end of the room,\r\nwhere they are attached to the Holcomb gem. Others, running to the\r\nopposite end, making contact with the tiny heavy stone we found in the\r\nbasement. Other wires run from the switches to lead bands around my\r\nwrists. Also, between switches are several connections--one circuit\r\ncontaining an amplifying apparatus. By throwing these switches in\r\nvarious combinations, I can secure any given alteration of forces, and\r\ndirect them where I choose.\r\n\r\nFor there are two other wires. These run from my own lead bracelets to\r\nanother room; a pair clamped around the wrists of Ariadne.\r\n\r\nFor I, Hobart Fenton, am now a living, human transforming station. I am\r\nconverting the power of the Infinite into the Energy of Life. And I am\r\ntransmitting that power directly out of the ether, as conduced through\r\nthese two marvellous stones, back into the nervous system of the girl I\r\nlove. Another hour, and she will Exist!\r\n\r\nIt was all so very simple, now that I understand it. And yet--well, an\r\nabsolutely new thing is always very hard to put into words.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I must acknowledge the enormous help which I have had\r\nfrom my friends: Miss Clarke, Mme. Le Fabre, General Hume, Dr. Malloy,\r\nand Herold. These people are still in the house with me; I think they\r\nare eating supper. I've already had mine. Really, I can't take much\r\ncredit to myself for what I have found out. The others supplied most of\r\nthe facts. I merely happened to fit them together; and, because of my\r\nrelationship to the problem, am now doing the heroic end of the work.\r\n\r\nAs for Harry--he and Dr. Holcomb, Chick Watson and even the dog--I shall\r\nhave them out of the Blind Spot inside of twelve hours. All I need is\r\na little rest. I'll go straight to bed as soon as I finish reviving\r\nAriadne; and when I wake up, we'll see who's who, friend Rhamda!\r\n\r\nI'm too exuberant to hold myself down to the job of telling what I've\r\ndiscovered. But it's got to be done. Here goes!\r\n\r\nI practically took my life in my hands when I first made connection.\r\nHowever, I observed the precaution of rigging up a primary connection\r\ndirect from the ring to the pebble, running the wire along the floor\r\nsome distance away from where I sat. No ill effects when I ventured into\r\nthe line of force; so I began to experiment with the switches.\r\n\r\nThat precautionary circuit was Herold's idea. His, also, the amplifying\r\napparatus. The mental attitude was Miss Clarke's, modified by Dr.\r\nMalloy. The lead bracelets were Mme. Le Fabre's suggestion; they\r\nwork fine. Sir Henry was the one who pointed out the advantage of the\r\nmicrophone I am using. If my hands become paralysed I can easily call\r\nfor help to my side.\r\n\r\nWell, the first connection I tried resulted in nothing. Perfectly blank.\r\nThen I tried another and another, meanwhile continually adjusting the\r\namplifier; and as a result I am now able, at will, to do either or all\r\nof the following:\r\n\r\n(1) I can induct sounds from the Blind Spot; (2) I can induct light, or\r\nvisibility; or (3) any given object or person, in toto.\r\n\r\nAnd now to tell how. No, I'm just sleepy, not weak.\r\n\r\nLet's see; where was I? Oh, yes; those connections. They've got to be\r\ndone just right, with the proper tension in the coils, and the correct\r\nmental attitude, to harmonise. I wish I wasn't so tired!\r\n\r\nOne moment! No, no; I'm all right. I--Queer! By Jove, that's a funny\r\nthing just now! I must have got an inducted current from another wire,\r\nmixed with these! And--I got a glimpse into the Blind Spot!\r\n\r\nA great--No; it's a--What a terrific crowd! Wonder what they're all--By\r\nJove, it's--Good Lord, it's he! And Chick! No, I'm not wandering! I'm\r\nhaving the experience of my life!\r\n\r\nNow--THAT'S the boy! Don't let 'em bluff you! Good! Good! Tell 'em where\r\nto head in! That's the boy! Rub it in! I don't know what you're up to,\r\nbut I'm with you!\r\n\r\nEr--there's a big crowd of ugly looking chaps there, and I can't make it\r\nout--Just a moment--a moment. What does it mean, anyway? Just--I--\r\n\r\nDANGER, by Heaven! THAT'S what it means!\r\n\r\nNo; I'm all right. The--thing came to an end, abruptly. That's all;\r\neverything normal again; the room just the same as it was a moment ago.\r\nHello! I seem to have started something! The wire down on the floor has\r\ncommenced to hum! Oh, I've got my eye on it, and if anything--\r\n\r\nMiss Dibble! Tell Herold to come! On the run! Quick! Did you? Good!\r\ndon't stop writing! I--\r\n\r\nThere's Chick! CHICK! How did you get here? What? YOU CAN'T SEE ME!\r\nWhy--\r\n\r\nChick! Listen! Listen, man! I've gone into the Blind Spot! Write this\r\ndown! The connection--\r\n\r\nThat's Herold! Herold, this is Chick Watson! Listen, now, you\r\ntwo! The--the--I can hardly--it's from No. 4 to--to--to the\r\nring--then--coil--\r\n\r\nBoth switches, Chick! Ah! I've--\r\n\r\nNOTE BY MISS L. DIBBLE.--Just as Mr. Fenton made the concluding remark\r\nas above, there came a loud crash, followed by the voice of Mr. Herold.\r\nThen, there came a very loud clang from a bell; just one stroke. After\r\nwhich I caught Mr. Fenton's voice:\r\n\r\n“Herold--Chick can tell you what IT wants us to do--”\r\n\r\nAnd with that, his voice trailed off into nothing, and died away. As for\r\nMr. Fenton himself, I am informed that he has utterly disappeared; and\r\nin his stead there now exists a man who is known to Dr. Hansen as Chick\r\nWatson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAN FROM SPACE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore starting the conclusion of the Blind Spot mystery it may be\r\njust as well for the two publicists who are bringing it to the press to\r\nfollow Hobart Fenton's example and go into a bit of explanation.\r\n\r\nThe two men who wrote the first two parts were participants, and\r\nnecessarily writing almost in the present tense. While they could give\r\nan accurate and vivid account of their feelings and experiences, they\r\ncould only guess at what lay in the future, at the events that would\r\nunravel it all.\r\n\r\nBut the present writers have the advantage of working, of seeing, of\r\nweighing in the retrospect. They know just where they are going.\r\n\r\nThe coming of Chick Watson brought new perspective. Hitherto we had been\r\nlooking into the darkness. Whatever had been caught in the focus of the\r\nSpot had become lost to our five senses.\r\n\r\nYet, facts are facts. It was no mere trickery that had caught Dr.\r\nHolcomb in the beginning. One by one, men of the highest standards and\r\ncharacter had been either victims or witness to its reality and power.\r\n\r\nSo the coming of Watson may well be set down as one of the deciding\r\nmoments of history. He who had been the victim a year before was\r\nreturning through the very Spot that had engulfed him. He was the herald\r\nof the great unknown, an ambassador of the infinite itself.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that of all the inmates of the house, Dr. Hansen\r\nwas the only one who had a personal acquaintance with Watson. One year\r\nbefore the doctor had seen him a shadow--wasted, worn, exhausted. He had\r\ntalked with him on that memorable night in the cafe. Well he remembered\r\nthe incident, and the subject of that strange conversation--the secret\r\nof life that had been discovered by the missing Dr. Holcomb. And Dr.\r\nHansen had pondered it often since.\r\n\r\nWhat was the force that was pulsing through the Blind Spot? It had\r\nreached out on the earth, and had plucked up youth as well as wisdom.\r\nTHIS was the first time it had ever given up that which it had taken!\r\n\r\nIt was Watson, sure enough; but it was not the man he had known one year\r\nbefore. Except for the basic features Hansen would not have recognized\r\nhim; the shadow was gone, the pallor, the touch of death. He was hale\r\nand radiant; his skin had the pink glow of alert fitness; except for\r\nbeing dazed, he appeared perfectly natural. In the tense moment of his\r\narrival the little group waited in silence. What had he to tell them?\r\n\r\nBut he did not see them at first. He groped about blindly, moving slowly\r\nand holding his hands before him. His face was calm and settled; its\r\nlines told decision. There was not a question in any mind present but\r\nthat the man had come for a purpose.\r\n\r\nWhy could he not see? Perhaps the light was too dim. Some one thought to\r\nturn on the extra lights.\r\n\r\nIt brought the first word from Watson. He threw up both arms before his\r\nface; like one shutting out the lightning.\r\n\r\n“Don't!” he begged. “Don't! Shut off the lights; you will blind me!\r\nPlease; please! Darken the room!”\r\n\r\nSir Henry sprang to the switch. Instantly the place went to shadow;\r\nthere was just enough light from the moon to distinguish the several\r\nforms grouped in the middle of the room. Dr. Hansen proffered a chair.\r\n\r\n“Thank you! Ah! Dr. Hansen! You are here--I had thought--This is much\r\nbetter! I can see fairly well now. You came very near to blinding me\r\npermanently! You didn't know. It's the transition.” Then: “And yet--of\r\ncourse! It's the moon! THE MOON!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. There was a strange wistfulness in the last word. And\r\nsuddenly he rose to his feet. He turned in gladness, as though to drink\r\nin the mellow flow of the radiance.\r\n\r\n“The moon! Gentlemen--doctor--who are these people? This is the house\r\nof the Blind Spot! And it is the moon--the good old earth! And San\r\nFrancisco!”\r\n\r\nHe stopped again. There was a bit of indecision and of wonder mixed\r\nwith his gladness. The stillness was only broken by the scarcely audible\r\nvoice of Mme. Le Fabre.\r\n\r\n“Now we KNOW! It is proven. The sceptics have always asked why the\r\nspirits work only in the half light. We know now.”\r\n\r\nWatson looked to Dr. Hansen. “Who is this lady? Who are these others?”\r\n\r\n“Can you see them?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly. It is the lady in the corner; she thinks--”\r\n\r\n“That you are a spirit!”\r\n\r\nWatson laughed. “I a spirit? Try me and see!”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” asserted Mme. Le Fabre. “You are out of the Blind Spot. I\r\nknow; it will prove everything!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; the Spot.” Watson hesitated. Again the indecision. There was\r\nsomething latent that he could not recall; though conscious, part of his\r\nmind was still in the apparent fog that lingers back into slumber.\r\n\r\n“I don't understand,” he spoke. “Who are you?”\r\n\r\nIt was Sir Henry this time. “Mr. Watson, we are a sort of committee.\r\nThis is the house at 288 Chatterton Place. We are after the great secret\r\nthat was discovered by Dr. Holcomb. We were summoned by Hobart Fenton.”\r\n\r\nConsciousness is an enigma. Hitherto Watson had been almost inert;\r\nhis actions and manner of speech had been mechanical. That it was the\r\nnatural result of the strange force that had thrown him out, no one\r\ndoubted. The mention of Hobart Fenton jerked him into the full vigour of\r\nwide-awake thinking; he straightened himself.\r\n\r\n“Hobart! Hobart Fenton! Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“That we do not know,” answered Sir Henry. “He was here a moment ago. It\r\nis almost too impossible for belief. Perhaps you can tell us.”\r\n\r\n“You mean--”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. Into the Blind Spot. One and the other; your coming was\r\ncoincident with his going!”\r\n\r\nChick raised up. Even in that faint light they could appreciate the full\r\nvigour of his splendid form. He was even more of an athlete than in his\r\ncollege days, before the Blind Spot took him. And when he realised what\r\nSir Henry had said he held up one magnificent arm, almost in the manner\r\nof benediction:\r\n\r\n“Hobart has gone through? Thank Heaven for that!”\r\n\r\nIt was a puzzle. True, in that little group there was represented the\r\naccumulated wisdom of human effort. With the possible exception of the\r\ngeneral, there was not a sceptic among them. They were ready to explain\r\nalmost anything--but this.\r\n\r\nIn the natural weakness of futility they had come to associate the\r\naspect of death or terror with the Blind Spot. Yet, here was Watson!\r\nWatson, alive and strong; he was the reverse of what they had\r\nsubconsciously expected.\r\n\r\n“What is this Blind Spot?” inquired Sir Henry evenly. “And what do you\r\nmean by giving thanks that Fenton has gone into it?”\r\n\r\n“Not now. Not one word of explanation until--What time is it?” Watson\r\nbroke off to demand.\r\n\r\nThey told him. He began to talk rapidly, with amazing force and\r\ndecision, and in a manner whose sincerity left no chance for doubt.\r\n\r\n“Then we have five hours! Not one second to lose. Do what I say, and\r\nanswer my questions!” Then: “We must not fail; one slip, and the whole\r\nworld will be engulfed--in the unknown! Turn on the lights.”\r\n\r\nThere was that in the personality and the vehemence of the man that\r\nprecluded opposition. Out of the Blind Spot had come a dynamic quality,\r\nalong with the man; a quickening influence that made Watson swift, sure,\r\nand positive. Somehow they knew it was a moment of Destiny.\r\n\r\nWatson went on:\r\n\r\n“First, did Hobart Fenton open the Spot? Or was it a period? By 'period'\r\nI mean, did it open by chance, as it did when it caught Harry and me?\r\nJust what did Hobart do? Tell me!”\r\n\r\nIt was a singular question. How could they answer it? However, Dr.\r\nMalloy related as much as he knew of what Hobart had done; his wires\r\nand apparatus were now merely a tangled mass of fused metals. Nothing\r\nremained intact but the blue gem and the red pebble.\r\n\r\n“I see. And this pebble: you found it by digging in the cellar, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n\r\nHow did he know that? Dr. Hansen brought that curiously heavy little\r\nstone and laid it in Watson's hand. The newcomer touched it with his\r\nfinger, and for a brief moment he studied it. Then he looked up.\r\n\r\n“It's the small one,” he stated. “And you found it in the cellar. It was\r\nvery fortunate; the opening of the Spot was perhaps a little more than\r\nhalf chance. But it was wonderfully lucky. It let me out. And with the\r\nhelp of God and our own courage we may open it again, long enough to\r\nrescue Hobart, Harry, and Dr. Holcomb. Then--we must break the chain--we\r\nmust destroy the revelation; we must close the Spot forever!”\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that they couldn't understand what he meant. Dr. Hansen\r\nthought to cut in with a practical question:\r\n\r\n“My dear Chick, what's inside the Spot? We want to know!”\r\n\r\nBut it was not Watson who answered. It was Mme. Le Fabre.\r\n\r\n“Spirits, of course.”\r\n\r\nWatson gave a sudden laugh. This time he answered:\r\n\r\n“My dear lady, if you know what I know, and what Dr. Holcomb has\r\ndiscovered, you would ask YOURSELF a question or so. Possibly you\r\nyourself are a spirit!”\r\n\r\n“What!” she gasped. “I--a spirit!”\r\n\r\n“Exactly. But there is no time for questions. Afterwards--not now. Five\r\nhours, and we must--”\r\n\r\nSomeone came to the door. It was Jerome. At the sight of Watson he\r\nstopped, clutching the stub of his cigar between his teeth. His grey\r\neyes took in the other's form from head to shoe leather.\r\n\r\n“Back?” he inquired. “What did you find out, Watson? They must have fed\r\nyou well over yonder!”\r\n\r\nAnd Jerome pointed toward the ceiling with his thumb. It wasn't in his\r\ndour nature to give way to enthusiasm; this was merely his manner of\r\nwelcome. Watson smiled.\r\n\r\n“The eats were all right, Jerome, but not all the company. You're just\r\nthe man I want. We have little time; none to spare for talk. Are you in\r\ntouch with Bertha Holcomb?”\r\n\r\nThe detective nodded.\r\n\r\nWatson took the chair that Fenton had so strangely vacated and reached\r\nfor paper and pencil. Once or twice he stopped to draw a line, but\r\nmostly he was calculating. He referred constantly to a paper he took\r\nfrom his pocket. When he was through he spread his palm over what he had\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n“Jerome!”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You are no longer connected with headquarters, I presume. But--can you\r\nget men?”\r\n\r\n“If need be.”\r\n\r\n“You will need them!” Just then Watson noticed the uniform of General\r\nHume. “Jerome, can you give this officer a bodyguard?”\r\n\r\nIt was both unusual and lightning-sudden. Nevertheless, there was\r\nsomething in Watson's manner that called for no challenge; something\r\nthat would have brooked no refusal. And the general, although a sceptic,\r\nwas acting solely from force of habit when he objected:\r\n\r\n“It seems to me, Watson, that you--”\r\n\r\nThose who were present are not likely to forget it. Some men are born,\r\nsome rise, to the occasion; but Watson was both. He was clear-cut,\r\ndominant, inexorable. He levelled his pencil at the general.\r\n\r\n“It SEEMS to you! General, let me ask you: If your country's safety were\r\nat stake, would you hesitate to throw reinforcements into the breach?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly.”\r\n\r\n“All right. It's settled. Take care of your red tape AFTERWARDS.”\r\n\r\nHe wheeled to the detective. “Jerome, this is a sketch of the\r\ncompartments of Dr. Holcomb's safe. Not the large one in his house, but\r\nthe small one in his laboratory. Go straight to Dwight Way. Give this\r\nnote,” indicating another paper, “to Bertha Holcomb. Tell her that her\r\nfather is safe, and that I am out of the Blind Spot. Tell her you have\r\ncome to open the laboratory safe. I've written down the combination. If\r\nit doesn't work use explosives; there's nothing inside which force can\r\nharm. In the compartment marked 'X' you will find a small particle about\r\nthe size of a pea, wrapped in tin-foil, and locked in a small metal box.\r\nYou will have to break the box. As for the contents, once you see the\r\nstone you can't mistake it; it will weigh about six pounds. Get it, and\r\nguard it with your life!”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\nJerome put Watson's instructions in his wallet, at the same time\r\nglancing about the room.\r\n\r\n“Where is Fenton?” he asked.\r\n\r\nIt was Watson who answered. He gave us the first news that had ever come\r\nfrom the Blind Spot. He spoke with firm deliberation, as though in full\r\nrealisation of the sensation:\r\n\r\n“Hobart Fenton has gone through the Blind Spot. Just now he is right\r\nhere in this room.”\r\n\r\nSir Henry jumped.\r\n\r\n“In this room! Is that what you said, Watson?”\r\n\r\nThe other ignored him.\r\n\r\n“Jerome, you haven't a minute to lose! You and the general; bring that\r\nstone back to this house at ANY cost! Hurry!”\r\n\r\nIn another moment Jerome and Hume were gone. And few people, that day,\r\nsuspected the purport of that body of silent men who crossed over the\r\nBay of San Francisco. They were grim, and trusted, and under secret\r\norders. They had a mission, did they but know it, as important as any\r\nin history. But they knew only that they were to guard Jerome and the\r\ngeneral at all hazards. One peculiarly heavy stone, “the size of a pea”!\r\nHow are we ever to calculate its value?\r\n\r\nAs for the group remaining with Watson, not one of them ever dreamed\r\nthat any danger might come out of the Blind Spot. Its manifestations had\r\nbeen local and mostly negative. No; the main incentive of their interest\r\nhad been simply curiosity.\r\n\r\nBut apparently Watson was above them all. He paid no further attention\r\nto them for a while; he bent at Fenton's desk and worked swiftly. At\r\nlength he thrust his papers aside.\r\n\r\n“I want to see that cellar,” he announced. “That is, the point where you\r\nfound that red pebble!”\r\n\r\nDown in the basement, Sir Henry gave the details. When he came to\r\nmention the various liquids which Fenton had poured into the woodwork\r\nupstairs Watson examined the pool intently.\r\n\r\n“Quite so. They would come out here--naturally.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally!”\r\n\r\nSir Henry could not understand. His perplexity was reflected in the\r\nfaces of Herold, the two physicians, Dr. Malloy, Miss Clarke, and Mme.\r\nLe Fabre--and Charlotte spoke for them all:\r\n\r\n“Can't you explain, Mr. Watson? The woodwork had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith the cellar. There was the floor between, just as you see it now.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally,” Watson repeated. “It could be no other place! It was on its\r\nway to the other side, but it could go only half-way. Simply a matter\r\nof focus, you know. I beg pardon; you must hold your curiosity a little\r\nlonger.”\r\n\r\nHe began measuring. First he located the line across the floorjoists\r\noverhead, where rested the partition separating the dining-room from\r\nthe parlour. Finding the middle of this line, he dropped an improvised\r\nplumb-line to the ground; and from this spot as centre, using a string\r\nabout ten feet long, he described a circle on the earth. Then, referring\r\nto his calculations, he proceeded to locate several points with small\r\nstakes pressed into the soil. Then he checked them off and nodded.\r\n\r\n“It's even better than the professor thought. His theory is all but\r\nproven. If Jerome and Hume can deliver the other stone without accident,\r\nwe can save those now inside the Spot.” Then, very solemnly: “But we\r\nface a heavy task. It will be another Thermopylae. We must hold the gate\r\nagainst an occult Xerxes, together with all his horde.”\r\n\r\n“The hosts of the dead!” exclaimed Mme. Le Fabre.\r\n\r\n“No; the living! Just give me time, Madame, and you will see something\r\nhitherto undreamed of. As for your theory--tomorrow you may doubt\r\nwhether you are living or dead! In other words, Dr. Holcomb has\r\ncertainly proved the occult by material means. He has done it with a\r\nvengeance. In so doing he has left us in doubt as to ourselves; and\r\nunless he discovers the missing factor within the next few hours we are\r\ngoing to be in the anomalous position of knowing plenty about the next\r\nworld, but nothing about ourselves.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. He must have known that their curiosity could not hold out\r\nmuch longer. He said:\r\n\r\n“Now, just one thing more, friends, and I can tell you everything, while\r\nwe are waiting for Jerome and the general to return. But first I must\r\nsee the one who preceded me out of the spot.”\r\n\r\n“Ariadne!” from Charlotte, in wonder.\r\n\r\n“Ariadne!” exclaimed Watson. He was both puzzled and amazed. “Did you\r\ncall her--Ariadne?”\r\n\r\n“She is upstairs,” cut in Dr. Higgins.\r\n\r\n“I must see her!”\r\n\r\nA minute or two later they stood in the room where the girl lay. The\r\ncoverlet was thrown back somewhat revealing the bare left arm and\r\nshoulder, and the delicately beautiful face upon the pillow. Her golden\r\nhair was spread out in riotous profusion. The other hand was just\r\nprotruding from the coverlet, and displayed a faint red mark, showing\r\nwhere Hobart's bracelet had been fastened at the moment he disappeared.\r\n\r\nCharlotte stepped over and laid her hand against the girl's cheek.\r\n“Isn't she wonderful!” she murmured.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Higgins looked to Watson.\r\n\r\n“Do you know her?”\r\n\r\nThe other nodded. He stooped over and listened to her breathing. His\r\nmanner was that of reverence and admiration. He touched her hand.\r\n\r\n“I see how it must have happened. Precisely what I experienced, only--”\r\n Then: “You call her Ariadne?”\r\n\r\n“We had to call her something,” replied Charlotte. “And the name--it\r\njust came, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps. Anyhow, it was a remarkably good guess. Her true name is the\r\nAradna.”\r\n\r\n“THE Aradna? Who--what is she?”\r\n\r\n“Just that: the Aradna. She is one of the factors that may save us.\r\nAnd on earth we would call her queen.” Then, without waiting for the\r\ninevitable question, Watson said:\r\n\r\n“Your professional judgment will soon come to the supreme test, Dr.\r\nHiggins. She is simply numbed and dazed from coming through the Spot.”\r\n Charlotte had already described to him the girl's arrival. “The mystery\r\nis that she was permitted an hour of rationality before this came upon\r\nher. I wonder if Hobart's vitality had anything to do with it?”--half to\r\nhimself. “As for the Rhamda”--he smiled--“he is merely interested in\r\nthe Spot; that is all. He would never harm the Aradna; he had nothing\r\nwhatever to do with her condition. We were mistaken about the man.\r\nAnyway, it is the Spot of Life that interests us now.”\r\n\r\n“The Spot of Life,” repeated Sir Henry. “Is that--”\r\n\r\n“Yes; the Blind Spot, as it is known from the other side. It overtops\r\nall your sciences, embraces every cult, and lies at the base of all\r\ntruth. It is--it is everything.”\r\n\r\n“Explain!”\r\n\r\nWatson turned to the head upon the pillow. He ventured to touch the\r\ncheek, with a trace of tenderness in his action and of wistfulness near\r\nto reverence. It was not love; it was rather as one might touch a fairy.\r\nIn both spirit and substance she was truly of another world. Watson gave\r\na soft sigh and looked up at the Englishman.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can explain. Now that I know she is well, I shall tell you all\r\nI know from the beginning. It's certainly your turn to ask questions.\r\nI may not be able to tell you all that you want to know; but at least I\r\nknow more than any other person this side of the Spot. Let us go down to\r\nthe library.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at a clock. “We have nearly five hours remaining. Our test\r\nwill come when we open the Spot. We must not only open it, but we must\r\nclose it at all costs.”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the lower hall. At the front door Watson paused and\r\nturned to the others.\r\n\r\n“Just a moment. We may fail tonight. In case we do, I would like one\r\nlast look at my own world--at San Francisco.”\r\n\r\nHe opened the door. The rest hung back; though they could not\r\nunderstand, they could sense, vaguely, the emotion of this strange man\r\nof brave adventure. The scene, the setting, the beauty, were all akin\r\nto the moment. Watson, stood bareheaded, looking down at the blinking\r\nlights of the city of the Argonauts. The moon in a starlit sky was\r\ndrifting through a ragged lace of cloud. And over it all was a momentary\r\nhush, as though the man's emotion had called for it.\r\n\r\nNo one spoke. At last Watson closed the door. And there was just the\r\ntrace of tears in his eyes as he spoke:\r\n\r\n“Now my friends--” And led the way into the parlour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE OCCULT WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\n“In telling what I know,” began Watson, “I shall use a bit of a preface.\r\nIt's necessary, in a way, if you are to understand me; besides, it will\r\ngive you the advantage of looking into the Blind Spot with the clear\r\neyes of reason. I intend to tell all, to omit nothing. My purpose in\r\ndoing this is that, in case we should fail tonight, you will be able to\r\ngive my account to the world.”\r\n\r\nIt was a strange introduction. His listeners exchanged thoughtful\r\nglances. But they all affirmed, and Sir Henry hitched his chair almost\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n“All right, Mr. Watson. Please proceed.”\r\n\r\n“To begin with,” said Watson, “I assume that you all know of Dr.\r\nHolcomb's announcement concerning the Blind Spot. You remember that he\r\npromised to solve the occult; how he foretold that he would prove it not\r\nby immaterial but by the very material means; that he would produce the\r\nfact and the substance.\r\n\r\n“Now, the professor had promised to deliver something far greater than\r\nhe had thought it to be. At the same time, what he knew of the\r\nBlind Spot was part conjecture and part fact. Like his forebears and\r\ncontemporaries, he looked upon man as the real being.\r\n\r\n“But it's a question, now, as to which is reality and which is not.\r\nThere is not a branch of philosophy that looks upon the question in that\r\nlight. Bishop Berkeley came near and he has been followed by others; but\r\nthey all have been deceived by their own sophistry. However, except for\r\nthe grossest materialists, all thinkers take cognizance of a hereafter.\r\n\r\n“No one dreamed of a Blind Spot and what it may lead to, what it might\r\ncontain. We are five-sensed; we interpret the universe by the measure of\r\nfive yardsticks. Yet, the Blind Spot takes even those away; the more we\r\nknow, it seems, the less certain we are of ourselves. As I said to Mme.\r\nLe Fabre, it is a difficult question to determine, after all, just who\r\nare the ghosts. At any rate, I KNOW”--and he paused for effect--“I know\r\nthat there are uncounted millions who look upon us and our workings as\r\nentirely supernatural!\r\n\r\n“Remember that what I have to tell you is just as real as your own lives\r\nhave been since babyhood.\r\n\r\n“It was slightly over a year ago that my last night on the earth\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n“I had gone out for the evening, in the forlorn hope of meeting a\r\nfriend, of having some slight taste of pleasure before the end came.\r\n\r\n“For several days I had been labouring under a sort of premonition,\r\nknowing that my life was slowly seeping away and that my vitality was\r\nslipping, bit by bit, to what I thought must be death. Had I then known\r\nwhat I know now, I could have saved myself. But if I had done it, if I\r\nhad saved myself, we would never have found Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it was the same fate that led me to Harry, that night. I don't\r\nknow. Nevertheless, if there is any truth in what I have learned on\r\nthe other side of the Blind Spot, it would seem that there is something\r\nhigher than mere fate. I had never believed in luck; but when everything\r\nworks out to a fraction of a breath, one ceases to be sceptical on the\r\nquestion of destiny and chance. _I_ say, everything that happened that\r\nnight was FORCED from the other side. In short, my giving that ring to\r\nHarry was simply a link in the chain of circumstances. It just had to\r\nbe; the PROPHECY would not have had it otherwise.”\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to explain what he meant by the word “prophecy,” Watson\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n“That's what makes it puzzling. I have never been able to understand\r\nhow every bit has dovetailed with such exactness. We--you and I--are\r\ncertainly not supernatural; and yet, on the other side of the Spot, the\r\nproof is overwhelmingly convincing.\r\n\r\n“I was very weak that night. So weak that it is difficult for me to\r\nremember. The last I recollect was my going to the back of the house;\r\nto the kitchen, I think. I had a light in my hands. The boys were in the\r\nfront room, waiting. One of them had opened a door some yards away from\r\nwhere I stood.\r\n\r\n“Coming as it did, on the instant, it is difficult to describe. But I\r\nknew it instinctively for what it was: the dot of blue on the ceiling,\r\nand the string of light. Then, a sensation of falling, like dropping\r\ninto space itself. It is hard to describe the horrifying terror of\r\nplunging head on from an immense height to a plain at a vastly lower\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n“And that's all that I remember--from this side.” [Footnote: NOTE.--In\r\njustice to Mr. Watson, the present writers have thought it best at this\r\nstage to transpose the story from the first to the third person. Any\r\nnarrative, unless it is negative in its material, is hard to give in\r\nthe first person; for where the narrator has played an active, positive\r\npart, he must either curb himself or fall under the slur of braggadocio.\r\nYet, the world wants the details exactly as they happened; hence the\r\ntransposition. EDITORS.]\r\n\r\nWatson opened his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was light and a sense of great pain. There was a\r\npressure at the back of the eyeballs, a poignant sensation not unlike\r\na knife-thrust; that, and a sudden fear of madness, of drivelling\r\nhelplessness.\r\n\r\nThe abrupt return of consciousness in such a condition is not easy to\r\nimagine. After all he had gone through, this strange sequel must have\r\nbeen terribly puzzling to him. He was a man of good education, well\r\nversed in psychology; in the first rush of consciousness he tried, as\r\nbest he could, to weigh himself up in the balance of aberration. And it\r\nwas this very fact that gave him his reassurance; for it told him that\r\nhe could think, could reason, could count on a mind in full function.\r\n\r\nBut he could not see. The pain in his eyeballs was blinding. There was\r\nnothing he could distinguish; everything was woven together, a mere\r\nblaze of wonderful, iridescent, blazing coloration.\r\n\r\nBut if he could not see, he could feel. The pain was excruciating.\r\nHe closed his eyes and fell to thinking, curiously enough, that the\r\nexperience was similar to what he had gone through when upon learning to\r\nswim, he had first opened his eyes under the water. It had been under\r\na blazing sun. The pain and the colour--it was much the same, only\r\nintensified.\r\n\r\nThen he knew that he was very tired. The mere effort of that one thought\r\nhad cost him vitality. He dropped back into unconsciousness, such as\r\nwas more insensibility than slumber. He had strange dreams, of people\r\nwalking, of women, and of many voices. It was blurred and indistinct,\r\nyet somehow not unreal. Then, after an unguessable length of time--he\r\nawoke.\r\n\r\nHe was much stronger. The lapse may have been very long; he could not\r\nknow. But the pain in his eyes was gone; and he ventured to open the\r\nlids again in the face of the light that had been so baffling. This time\r\nhe could see; not distinctly, but still enough to assure him of reality.\r\nBy closing his eyes at intervals he was able to rest them and to\r\naccustom them gradually to the new degree of light. And after a bit he\r\ncould see plainly.\r\n\r\nHe was on a cot, and in a room almost totally different from any that\r\nhe had ever seen before. The colour of the walls, even, was dissimilar;\r\nlikewise the ceiling. It was white, in a way, and yet unlike it; neither\r\ndid it resemble any of the various tints; to give it a name that he\r\nafterward learned--alna--implies but little. It was utterly new to him.\r\n\r\nApparently he was alone. The room was not large; about the size of an\r\nordinary bedroom. And after the first novelty of the unplaceable colour\r\nhad worn off he began to take stock of his own person.\r\n\r\nFirst, he was covered by the finest of bed clothing, thick but\r\nexceedingly light. There was no counterpane, but two blankets and two\r\nsheets; and none of them corresponded to any colour or material he had\r\never known. He only knew that their tints were light rather than dark.\r\n\r\nNext, he moved his hands out from under the coverings, and held them up\r\nbefore his eyes. He was immensely puzzled. He naturally expected to see\r\nthe worn, emaciated hands which had been his on that dramatic night; but\r\nthe ones before him were plump, normal, of a healthy pink. The wrists\r\nlikewise were in perfect condition, also his arms. He could not account\r\nfor this sudden return to health, of the vigour he had known before he\r\nbegan to wear the ring. He lay back pondering.\r\n\r\nPresently he fell to examining his clothes. There were two garments made\r\nof a silk-like textile, rather heavy as to weight, but exceedingly soft\r\nas to touch. They were slightly darker than the bed clothing. In a way\r\nthey were much like pyjamas, except that both were designed to be merely\r\nslipped into place, without buttons or draw-strings. That is, they were\r\ntailored to fit snugly over the shoulders and waist, while loose enough\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThen he noticed the walls of the room. They were after a simple,\r\nsymmetrical style; coved--to use an architectural expression--or curved,\r\nwhere the corner would come with a radius much larger than common,\r\namounting to four or five feet; so that a person of ordinary height\r\ncould not stand close to the wall without stooping. Where the coved\r\nportion flowed into the perpendicular of the wall there was a broad\r\nmoulding, like a plate rail, which acted as a support for the hanging\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nWatson counted four of these pictures. Instinctively he felt that they\r\nmight give him a valuable clue as to his whereabouts. For, while his\r\nmind had cleared enough for him to feel sure that he had truly come\r\nthrough the Spot, he knew nothing more. Where was he? What would the\r\npictures tell?\r\n\r\nThe first was directly before his eyes. In size perhaps two by three\r\nfeet, with its greater length horizontal, it was more of a landscape\r\nthan a portrait. And Watson's eagerness for the subject itself made him\r\nforget to note whether the work was mechanically or manually executed.\r\n\r\nFor it revealed a girl--about ten or twelve--very slightly draped,\r\nenjoying a wild romp with a most extraordinary creature. It was this\r\nanimal that made the picture amazing; there was no subtle significance\r\nin the scene--there was nothing remarkable about the technique. The\r\nwhole interest, for Watson, was in the animal.\r\n\r\nIt was a deer; perfect and beautiful, but cast in a Lilliputian mould.\r\nIt stood barely a foot high, the most delicate thing he had ever looked\r\nupon. Mature in every detail of its proportion, the dainty hoofs, the\r\nfragile legs, smooth-coated body, and small, wide-antlered head--a\r\nminiature eight-pointer--made such a vision as might come to the dreams\r\nof a hunter.\r\n\r\nChick rose up in bed, in order to examine it more closely. Immediately\r\nhe fell back again slightly dizzy. He closed his eyes.\r\n\r\nShortly he began examining the other pictures. Two of these were\r\nsimple flower studies. Watson scarcely knew which puzzled him most; the\r\nblossoms or their containers. For the vases were like large-sized loving\r\ncups, broad as to body, and provided with a handle on either side. Their\r\ncolours were unfamiliar. As for the blossoms--in one study the blooms\r\nwere a half-dozen in number, and more like Shasta daisies than anything\r\nelse. But their colour was totally unlike, while they possessed wide,\r\nstriped stamens that gave the flowers an identity all their own. In\r\nthe other vase were several varieties, and every one absolutely\r\nunrecognisable.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the room was something fairly familiar. At\r\nfirst glance it seemed a simple basket of kittens, done in black and\r\nwhite--something like crayon, and yet resembling sepia. Alongside the\r\nbasket, however, was a spoon, one end resting on the edge of a saucer.\r\nAnd it was the size of the spoon that commanded Chick's attention;\r\nrather, the size of the kittens, any one of which could have curled up\r\ncomfortably in the bowl of the spoon! Judging relatively, if it were an\r\nordinary tablespoon, then the kittens were smaller than the smallest of\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nChick gave it up. Presently he began speculating about the time. He\r\ndecided that, whatever the hour might be, it was still daylight. In one\r\nwall of the room was a large, oval window, of a material which may as\r\nwell be called glass, frosted, so as to permit no view of what might lie\r\noutside. But it allowed plenty of light to enter.\r\n\r\nCut in the opposite wall was a doorway, hung with a curtain instead of\r\na door. This curtain was a gauzy material, but its maroonlike shade\r\ncompletely hid all view of whatever lay beyond.\r\n\r\nChick waited and listened. Hitherto he had not heard a sound. There was\r\nnot even that subtle, mixed hum from the distance that we are accustomed\r\nto associate with silence. He felt certain that he was inside the Blind\r\nSpot; but as to just where that locality might lie, he knew as little\r\nas before. He knew only that he in a building of some sort. Where, and\r\nwhat, was the building?\r\n\r\nJust then he noticed a cord dangling from the ceiling. It came down to\r\nwithin six inches of his head. He gave it a pull.\r\n\r\nWhereupon he heard a faint, musical jangling in the distance. He tried\r\nto analyse the sound. It was not bell-like; perhaps the word “tinkling”\r\n would serve better. Provisionally, Chick placed the key at middle D.\r\n\r\nA moment later he heard steps outside the curtain. They were very soft\r\nand light and deliberate; and almost at the same instant a delicate\r\nwhite hand moved the curtain aside.\r\n\r\nIt was a woman. Chick lay back and wondered. Although not beautiful she\r\nwas very good to look at, with large blue eyes of a deep tenderness and\r\nsympathy, even features, and a wonderful fold of rich brown hair held in\r\nplace by a satiny net.\r\n\r\nShe started when she saw Chick's wide open eyes; then smiled, a motherly\r\nsmile and compassionate. She was dressed in a manner at once becoming\r\nand odd, to one unaccustomed, in a gown that draped the entire figure,\r\nyet left the right arm and shoulder bare. Chick noticed that arm\r\nespecially; it was white as marble, moulded full, and laced with fine\r\nblue veins. He had never seen an arm like that. Nor such a woman. She\r\nmight have been forty.\r\n\r\nShe came over to the bed and placed a hand on Chick's forehead. Again\r\nshe smiled, and nodded.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel?” she asked.\r\n\r\nNow this is a strange thing; Watson could not account for it. For,\r\nalthough she did not speak English, yet he could understand her quite\r\nwell. At the moment it seemed perfectly obvious; afterward, the fact\r\nbecame amazing.\r\n\r\nHe answered in the same way, his thoughts directing his lips. And he\r\nfound that as long as he made no conscious attempt to select the words\r\nfor his thought, he could speak unhesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“Where am I?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled indulgently, but did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Is this the--Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“The Blind Spot! I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“Your nurse. Perhaps,” soothingly, “you would like to talk to the\r\nRhamda.”\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The Rhamda Geos.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nTHE PLUNGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woman left him. For a while Chick reflected upon what she had said.\r\nIn full rush of returning vigour his mind was working clearly and with\r\nanalytical exactness.\r\n\r\nFor the first time he noticed a heaviness in the air, overladen,\r\npregnant. He became aware of a strange, undercurrent of life; of an\r\nexceedingly faint, insistent sound, pulse-like and rhythmical, like the\r\nbreathing undertones of multitudes. He was a city man, and accustomed\r\nto the murmuring throbs of a metropolitan heart. But this was very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nPresently, amid the strangeness, he could distinguish the tinkle of\r\nelfin bells, almost imperceptible, but musical. The whole air was laden\r\nwith a subdued music, lined, as it were, with a golden vibrancy of\r\ntintinnabulary cadence--distant, subdued, hardly more than a whisper,\r\nyet part of the air itself.\r\n\r\nIt gave him the feeling that he was in a dream. In the realms of\r\nthe subconscious he had heard just such sounds--exotic and\r\nunearthly--fleeting and evanescent.\r\n\r\nThe notion of dreams threw his mind into sudden alertness. In an instant\r\nhe was thinking systematically, and in the definite realisation of his\r\nplight.\r\n\r\nThe woman had spoken of “the Rhamda.” True, she had added a qualifying\r\n“Geos,” but that did not matter. Whether Geos or Avec, it was still the\r\nRhamda. By this time Watson was convinced that the word indicated some\r\nsort of title--whether doctor, or lord, or professor, was not important.\r\nWhat interested Chick was identity. If he could solve that he could get\r\nat the crux of the Blind Spot.\r\n\r\nHe thought quickly. Apparently, it was Rhamda Avec who had trapped Dr.\r\nHolcomb. Why? What had been the man's motive? Watson could not say.\r\nHe only knew the ethics of the deed was shaded with the subtleness\r\nof villainy. That behind it all was a purpose, a directing force and\r\nintelligence that was inexorable and irresistible.\r\n\r\nOne other thing he knew; the Rhamda Avec came out of the region in which\r\nhe, Watson, now found himself. Rather, he could have come from nowhere\r\nelse. And Watson could feel certain that somewhere, somehow, he would\r\nfind Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\nIn that moment Watson determined upon his future course of action. He\r\ndecided to state nothing, intimate nothing, either by word or deed, that\r\nmight in any manner incriminate or endanger the professor. It was for\r\nhim to learn everything possible and to do all he could to gain his\r\npoints, without giving a particle of information in return. He must play\r\na lone hand and a cautious one--until he found Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\nThe fact of his position didn't appall him. Somehow, it had just the\r\nopposite effect. Perhaps it was because his strength had come back, and\r\nhad brought with it the buoyancy that is natural to health. He could\r\nsense the vitality that surrounded him, poised, potential, waiting only\r\nthe proper attitude on his part to become an active force. Something\r\ntremendous had happened to him, to make him feel like that. He was ready\r\nfor anything.\r\n\r\nFive minutes passed. Watson was alert and ready when the woman returned,\r\ntogether with a companion. She smiled kindly, and announced:\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda Geos.”\r\n\r\nAt first Chick was startled. There was a resemblance to Rhamda Avec\r\nthat ran almost to counterpart. The same refinement and elegance, the\r\nfleeting suggestion of youth, the evident age mingled with the same\r\nathletic ease and grace of carriage. Only he was somewhat shorter. The\r\neyes were almost identical, with the peculiar quality of the iris and\r\npupil that suggested, somehow, a culture inherited out of the centuries.\r\nHe was dressed in a black robe, such as would befit a scholar.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and held out a hand. Watson noted the firm clasp, and the\r\ncold thrill of magnetism.\r\n\r\n“You wish to speak with me?”\r\n\r\nThe voice was soft and modulated, resonant, of a tone as rich as bronze.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Where am I--sir?”\r\n\r\n“You do not know?”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Watson that there was real astonishment in the man's eyes.\r\nAs yet it had not come to Chick that he himself might be just as much\r\na mystery as the other. The only question in his mind at the moment was\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n“Is this the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“The Blind Spot!”--with the same lack of comprehension that the woman\r\nhad shown. “I do not understand you.”\r\n\r\n“Well, how did I get here?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as to that, you were found in the Temple of the Leaf. You were\r\nlying unconscious on the floor.”\r\n\r\n“A temple! How did I get there, sir? Do you know?”\r\n\r\n“We only know that a moment before there was nothing; next\r\ninstant--you.”\r\n\r\nWatson thought. There was a subconscious sound that still lingered in\r\nhis memory; a sound full-toned, flooding, enveloping. Was there any\r\nconnection--\r\n\r\n“'The Temple of the Leaf,' you call it, sir. I seem to remember having\r\nheard a bell. Is there such a thing in that temple?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda Geos smiled, his eyes brightening. “It is sometimes called\r\nthe Temple of the Bell.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” A pause, and Watson asked, “Where is this temple? And is this room\r\na part of the building?”\r\n\r\n“No. You are in the Sar-Amenive Hospital, an institution of the\r\nRhamdas.”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamdas! So there were several of them. A sort of society, perhaps.\r\n\r\n“In San Francisco?”\r\n\r\n“No. San Francisco! Again I fail to understand. This locality is known\r\nas the Mahovisal.”\r\n\r\n“The Mahovisal!” Watson thought in silence for a moment. He noted the\r\nextremely keen interest of the Rhamda, the ultra-intelligent flicker of\r\nthe eyes, the light of query and critical analysis. “You call this the\r\nMahovisal, sir? What is it: town, world or institution?”\r\n\r\nThe other smiled again. The lines about his sensitive mouth were\r\nsusceptible of various interpretations: emotion, or condescension, or\r\nthe satisfying feeling that comes from the simple vindication of some\r\ninner conviction. His whole manner was that of interest and respectful\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\n“You have never heard of the Mahovisal? Never?”\r\n\r\n“Not until this minute,” answered Watson.\r\n\r\n“You have no knowledge of anything before? Do you know WHO YOU ARE?”\r\n\r\n“I”--Watson hesitated, wondering whether he had best withhold this\r\ninformation. He decided to chance the truth. “My name is Chick Watson. I\r\nam--an American.”\r\n\r\n“An American?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda pronounced the word with a roll of the “r” that sounded more\r\nlike the Chinese “Mellican” than anything else. It was evident that\r\nthe sounds were totally unfamiliar to him. And his manner was a bit\r\nindefinite, doubtful, yet weighted with care, as he slowly repeated the\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n“An American? Once more I don't understand. I have never heard the word,\r\nmy dear sir. You are neither D'Hartian nor Kospian; although there are\r\nsome--materialists for the most part--who contend that you are just as\r\nany one else. That is--a man.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I am,” returned Watson, utterly confounded. He did not know\r\nwhat to say. He had never heard of a Kospian or a D'Hartian, nor of the\r\nMahovisal. It made things difficult; he couldn't get started. Most of\r\nall, he wanted information; and, instead, he was being questioned. The\r\nbest he could do was to equivocate.\r\n\r\nAs for the Rhamda, he frowned. Apparently his eager interest had been\r\ndashed with disappointment. But only slightly, as Watson could see; the\r\nman was of such culture and intellect as to have perfect control over\r\nhis emotions. In his balance and poise he was very like Avec, and he had\r\nthe same pleasing manner.\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” he began, “if you are really a man, then you can tell me\r\nsomething of great importance.”\r\n\r\n“I” Chick retorted, “can tell you nothing until you first let me know\r\njust where I stand!”\r\n\r\nCertainly there was a lack of common ground. Until one of them supplied\r\nit, there could be no headway. Watson realised that his whole future\r\nmight revolve about the axis of his next words.\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda thought a moment, dubiously, like one who has had a pet\r\ntheory damaged, though not shattered. Suddenly he spoke to the woman.\r\n\r\n“Open the portal,” said he.\r\n\r\nShe stepped to the oval window, touched a latch, and swung the pane\r\nhorizontally upon two pivots. Immediately the room was flooded with a\r\nstrange effulgence, amber-like, soft and mellow, as real sunshine.\r\n\r\nBut it was NOT real sunshine!\r\n\r\nThe window was set in a rather thick wall, beyond which Watson could\r\nsee a royal sapphiric sky, flecked with white and purple and\r\namethyst-threaded clouds poised above a great amber sleeping sun.\r\n\r\nIt was the sun that challenged attention. It was so mild, and yet so\r\nutterly beyond what might be expected. In diameter it would have made\r\nsix of the one Watson had known; in the blue distance, touching the rim\r\nof the horizon, it looked exactly like a huge golden plate set edgewise\r\non the end of the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd--he could look straight at it without blinking!\r\n\r\nHis thoughts ran back to the first account of the Rhamda. The man had\r\nlooked straight at the sun and had been blinded. This accounted for\r\nit! The man had been accustomed to this huge, soft-glowing beauty. An\r\namberous sun, deep yellow, sleeping; could it be, after all, dreamland?\r\n\r\nBut there were other things: the myriad tintinnabulations of these\r\nmicroscopic bells, never ceasing, musically throbbing; and now, the\r\nexotic delight of the softest of perfumes, an air barely tinted with\r\nviolet and rose, and the breath of woodland wild flowers. He could\r\nnot comprehend it. He looked at the purple clouds above the lotus sun,\r\nhardly believing, and deeply in doubt.\r\n\r\nA great white bird dived suddenly out of the heavens and flew into\r\nthe focus of his vision. In all the tales of his boyhood, of large and\r\nbeautiful rocs and other birds, he had come across nothing like this.\r\nFrom the perspective it must have measured a full three hundred feet\r\nfrom tip to tip; it was shaped like a swan and flew like an eagle, with\r\nmagnificent, lazy sweeps of the wings; while its plumage was as white as\r\nthe snow, new fallen on the mountains. And right behind it, in pursuit,\r\nhurtled a huge black thing, fully as large and just as swift; a\r\ntremendous black crow, so black that its sides gave off a greenish\r\nshimmer.\r\n\r\nJust then the woman closed the window. It was as well; Watson was only\r\nhuman, and he could hide his curiosity just so long and no longer. He\r\nturned to the Rhamda.\r\n\r\nThe man nodded. “I thought so,” said he with satisfaction, as one might\r\nwho has proven a pet and previous theory.\r\n\r\nWatson tried from another angle.\r\n\r\n“Just who do you think I am, sir?”\r\n\r\nThe other smiled as before. “It is not what I may think,” he replied:\r\n“but what I know. You are the proof that was promised us by the great\r\nRhamda Avec. You are--THE FACT AND THE SUBSTANCE!”\r\n\r\nHe waited for Watson's answer. Stupefaction delayed it. After a moment\r\nthe Rhamda continued:\r\n\r\n“Is it not so? Am I not right? You are surely out of the occult, my dear\r\nsir. You are a spirit!”\r\n\r\nIt took Chick wholly by surprise. He had been ready to deal with\r\nanything--but this. It was unreal, weird, impossible. And yet, why not?\r\nThe professor had set out to remove forever the screen that had hitherto\r\nshrouded the shadow: but what had he revealed? What had the Spot\r\ndisclosed? Unreality or REALITY? Which is which?\r\n\r\nIn the inspiration of the moment, Chick saw that he had reached the\r\ncrossroads of the occult. There was no time to think; there was time\r\nonly for a plunge. And, like all strong men, Watson chose the deeper\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the Rhamda Geos.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he quietly. “I--am a spirit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nUP FOR BREATH\r\n\r\n\r\nRhamda Geos, instead of showing the concern and uneasiness that most\r\nmen would show in the presence of an avowed ghost, evinced nothing but\r\na deep and reverent happiness. He took Watson's hand almost shyly. And\r\nwhile his manner was not effusive, it had the warmth that comes from the\r\nheart of a scholar.\r\n\r\n“As a Rhamda,” he declared, “I must commend myself for being the first\r\nto speak to you. And I must congratulate you, my dear sir, on having\r\nfallen, not into the hands of Bar Senestro, but into those of my own\r\nkind. It is a proof of the prophecy, and a vindication of the wisdom of\r\nthe Ten Thousand.\r\n\r\n“I bid you welcome to the Thomahlia, and I offer you my services, as\r\nguide and sponsor.”\r\n\r\nChick did not reply at once. The chance he had taken was one of those\r\nrare decisions that come to genius; the whole balance of his fate might\r\nswing upon his sudden impulse. Not that he had any compunction; but he\r\nfelt that it tied him down. It restricted him. Certainly almost any role\r\nwould be easier than that of a spirit.\r\n\r\nHe didn't feel like a ghost. He wondered just how a ghost would act,\r\nanyhow. What was more, he could not understand such a queer assumption\r\non the Rhamda's part. Why had he seemed to WANT Chick a ghost? Watson\r\nwas natural, human, embodied, just like the Rhamda. This was scarcely\r\nhis idea of a phantom's life. Most certainly, the two of them were men,\r\nnothing else; if one was a wraith, so was the other. But--how to account\r\nfor it?\r\n\r\nAgain he thought of Rhamda Avec. The words of Geos, “The Fact and the\r\nSubstance,” had been exactly synonymous with what had been said of Avec\r\nby Dr. Holcomb, “The proof of the occult.”\r\n\r\nWas it indeed possible that these two great ones, from opposite poles,\r\nhad actually torn away the veil of the shadow? And was this the place\r\nwhere he, Watson, must pose as a spirit, if he were to be accepted as\r\ngenuine?\r\n\r\nThe thought was a shock. He must play the same part here that the Rhamda\r\nhad played on the other side of the Spot; but he would have to do\r\nit without the guiding wisdom of Avec. Besides, there was something\r\nsinister in the unknown force that had engulfed so strong a mind as the\r\nprofessor's; for while Watson's fate had been of his own seeking, that\r\nof the doctor smacked too much of treachery.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the Rhamda Geos with a new question:\r\n\r\n“This Rhamda Avec--was he a man like yourself?”\r\n\r\nThe other brightened again, and asked in return:\r\n\r\n“Then you have seen him!”\r\n\r\n“I--I do not know,” answered Watson, caught off his guard. “But the name\r\nis familiar. I don't remember well. My mind is vague and confused. I\r\nrecall a world, a wonderful world it was from which I came, and a great\r\nmany people. But I can't place myself; I hardly--let me see--”\r\n\r\nThe other nodded sympathetic approval.\r\n\r\n“I understand. Don't exert yourself. It is hardly to be expected that\r\none forced out of the occult could come among us with his faculties\r\nunimpaired. We have had many communications with your world, and have\r\nalways been frustrated by this one gulf which may not be crossed. When\r\nreal thought gets across the border, it is often indefinite,\r\nsometimes mere drivel. Such answers as come from the void are usually\r\ndisappointing, no matter how expert our mediums may be in communicating\r\nwith the dead.”\r\n\r\n“The dead! Did you say--the dead?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; the dead. Are you not of the dead?”\r\n\r\nWatson shook his head emphatically.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely not! Not where I came from. We are all very much alive!”\r\n\r\nThe other watched him curiously, his great eyes glowing with enthusiasm;\r\nthe enthusiasm of the born seeker of the truth.\r\n\r\n“You don't mean,” he asked, “that you have the same passions that we\r\nhave here in life?”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” said Watson, “that we hate, love, swear; we are good and we\r\nare evil; and we play games and go fishing.”\r\n\r\nGeos rubbed his hands in a dignified sort of glee. What had been said\r\ncoincided, apparently, with another of his pet theories.\r\n\r\n“It is splendid,” he exulted, “splendid! And just in line with my\r\nthesis. You shall tell it before the Council of the Rhamdas. It will be\r\nthe greatest day since the speaking of the Jarados!”\r\n\r\nWatson wondered just who this Jarados might be; but for the moment he\r\nwent back to the previous question.\r\n\r\n“This Rhamda Avec: you were about to tell me about him. Let me have as\r\nmuch as I can understand, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! The great Rhamda Avec. Perhaps you may recall him when your\r\nmind clears a little more. My dear sir, he is, or was, the chief of the\r\nRhamdas of all the Thomahlia.”\r\n\r\n“What is the 'Thomahlia'?”\r\n\r\n“The Thomahlia! Why, it is called the world; our name for the world.\r\nIt comprises, physically, land, water and air; politically, it embraces\r\nD'Hartia, Kospia and a few minor nations.”\r\n\r\n“Who are the Rhamdas?”\r\n\r\n“They are the heads of--of the Thomahlia; not the nominal nor\r\npolitical nor religious heads--they are neither judicial, executive nor\r\nlegislative; but the real heads, still above. They might be called the\r\nsupreme college of wisdom, of science and of research. Also, they are\r\nthe keepers of the bell and its temple, and the interpreters of the\r\nProphecy of the Jarados.”\r\n\r\n“I see. You are a sort of priesthood.”\r\n\r\n“No. The priesthood is below us. The priests take what orders we choose\r\nto give, and are purely--”\r\n\r\n“Superstitious?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda's eyes snapped, just a trifle.\r\n\r\n“Not at all, my dear sir! They are good, sincere men. Only, not being\r\nintellectually adept enough to be admitted to the real secrets, the real\r\nknowledge, they give to all things a provisional explanation based upon\r\na settled policy. Not being Rhamdas, they are simply not aware that\r\neverything has an exact and absolute explanation.”\r\n\r\n“In other words,” put in Watson, “they are scientists; they have not\r\nlifted themselves up to the plane of inquisitive doubt.”\r\n\r\nStill the Rhamda shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Not quite that, either, my dear sir. Those below us are not ignorant;\r\nthey are merely nearer to the level of the masses than we are. In fact,\r\nthey are the people's rulers; these priests and other similar classes.\r\nBut we, the Rhamdas, are the rulers of the rulers. We differ from them\r\nin that we have no material ends to subserve. Being at the top, with no\r\nmotive save justice and advancement, our judgments are never questioned,\r\nand for the same reason, seldom passed.\r\n\r\n“But we are far above the plane of doubt that you speak of; we passed\r\nout of it long ago. That is the first stage of true science; afterwards\r\ncomes the higher levels where all things have a reason; ethics,\r\ninspiration, thought, emotion--”\r\n\r\n“And--the judgment of the Jarados?”\r\n\r\nWatson could not have told why he said it. It was impulse, and the\r\nimpromptu suggestion of a half-thought. But the effect of his words upon\r\nthe Rhamda and the nurse told him that, inadvertently, he had struck a\r\nkeynote. Both started, especially the woman. Watson took note of this\r\nin particular, because of the ingrained acceptance of the feminine in\r\nmatter of belief.\r\n\r\n“What do you know?” was her eager interruption. “You have seen the\r\nJarados?”\r\n\r\nAs for the Rhamda, he looked at Watson with shrewd, calculating eyes.\r\nBut they were still filled with wonder.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell us?” he asked. “Try and think!”\r\n\r\nChick knew that he had gained a point. He had been dealt a trump\r\ncard; but he was too clever to play it at once. He was on his own\r\nresponsibility and was carrying a load that required the finest\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\n“I really do not know,” he said. “I--I must have time to think. Coming\r\nacross the border that way you must give me time. You were telling me\r\nabout the Rhamdas in general; now tell me about Avec in particular.”\r\n\r\nGeos nodded as though he could understand the fog that beclouded\r\nWatson's mind.\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda Avec is, or was, the wisest of them all; the head and the\r\nchief, and by far the most able. Few beside his own fellows knew it,\r\nhowever; another than he was the nominal head, and officiated for\r\nhim whenever necessary. Avec had little social intercourse; he was a\r\nprodigious student.\r\n\r\n“We are a body of learned men, you understand, and we stand at the\r\npeak of all that has been discovered through hundreds upon hundreds\r\nof centuries, so that at the present day we are the culmination of the\r\ncombined effort and thought of man since the beginning of time. Each\r\ngeneration of Rhamdas must be greater than the one preceding. When I die\r\nand pass on to your world I must leave something new and worth-while\r\nto my successor; some thought, wisdom, or deed that may be of use to\r\nmankind. I cannot be a Rhamda else. We are a set of supreme priests, who\r\nserve man at the shrine of intelligence, not of dogma.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we are not to be judged too highly. All research, when it\r\nsteps forward must go haltingly; there are many paths into the unknown\r\nthat look like the real one. Hence, we have among us various schools of\r\nthought, and each following a different trail.\r\n\r\n“I myself am a spiritist. I believe that we can, and often have,\r\ncommunicated with your world at various times. There are others who do\r\nnot grant it; there are Rhamdas who are inclined to lean more to the\r\nmaterialist's side of things, who rely entirely, when it comes to\r\nquestions of this kind, upon their faith in the teachings of the\r\nJarados. There are some, too, who believe in the value of speculation,\r\nand who contend that only through contemplation can man lift himself to\r\nthe full fruits of realisation. At the head of us all--the Rhamda Avec!”\r\n\r\n“What was his belief?”\r\n\r\n“Let us say he believed ALL. He was eclectic. He held that we were\r\nall of us a bit right, and each of us a whole lot wrong. It was his\r\ncontention, however, that there was not one thing that could not be\r\nproven; that the secret of life, while undoubtedly a secret in every\r\nsense of the word, is still very concrete, it could be proven!”\r\n\r\nWatson nodded. He remembered hearing another man make just such a\r\nstatement--Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\n“For years he worked in private,” went on Geos. “We never knew just what\r\nhe was doing; until, one day, he called us together and delivered his\r\nlecture.”\r\n\r\n“His lecture?”\r\n\r\n“Rather, his prophecy. For it was all that. Not that he spoke at great\r\nlength; it was but a talk. He announced that he believed the time had\r\ncome to prove the occult. That it could be done, and done only through\r\nconcrete, material means; and that whatever existed, certainly could be\r\ndemonstrated. He was going to pull aside the curtain that had hitherto\r\ncut off the shadow.\r\n\r\n“'I am going to prove the occult,' he said. 'In three days I shall\r\nreturn with the fact and the substance. And then I propose to deliver my\r\ngreatest lecture, my final thesis, in which my whole life shall come\r\nto a focus. I shall bring the proof for your eyes and ears, for your\r\nfingers to explore and be satisfied. You shall behold the living truth.”\r\n\r\n“'And the subject of my lecture--the subject of my lecture will be The\r\nSpot of Life.'”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nTHROUGH UNKNOWN WATERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SPOT of Life! And the subject of Dr. Holcomb's lecture, promised but\r\nnever delivered, had been announced as--The Blind SPOT!\r\n\r\nTo Watson it was fairly astounding to discover that the two--Holcomb\r\nand Avec--had reached simultaneously for the curtain of the shadow. The\r\nprofessor had said that it would be “the greatest day since Columbus.”\r\n And so it had proven, did the world but know it.\r\n\r\n“And--the Rhamda Avec never returned?” asked Chick.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But he sent back something within three days?” Watson was thinking,\r\nof course, of the doctor who had disappeared on the day which, Jerome\r\noverheard the Rhamda to say, was the last of his stay.\r\n\r\nBut Geos did not reply. Why, Chick could not guess. He thought it best\r\nnot to press the question; in good time, if he went at it carefully,\r\nhe could gain his end with safety. At the moment he must not arouse\r\nsuspicion. He chose another query.\r\n\r\n“Did Avec go alone?”\r\n\r\n“No. The Nervina went with him. Rather, she followed within a few\r\nhours.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\nIt was out before Watson could think. The Rhamda looked up suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Then you have seen the Nervina! You know her?”\r\n\r\nChick lied. It was not his intention, just at present, to tie himself\r\ndown to anything that might prove compromising or restraining.\r\n\r\n“The name is--familiar. Who is this Nervina?”\r\n\r\n“She is one of the queens. I thought--My dear sir, she is one of the\r\nqueens of Thomahlia, half Kospian, half D'Hartian; of the first royal\r\nline running through from the day of the Jarados.”\r\n\r\nChick cogitated for a moment. Then, taking an entirely new tack:\r\n\r\n“You say the Rhamda and this Nervina, independently, solved the mystery\r\nof the Spot of Life, I believe you call it. And that Spot leads,\r\napparently, into the occult?”\r\n\r\n“Apparently, if not positively. It was the wisdom of Avec, mostly. He\r\nhad been in communication with your world by means of his own discovery\r\nand application. It was all in line with the prophecy.\r\n\r\n“Since he and the Nervina left, the people of the world have been in a\r\nstate of ferment. For it was foretold that in the last days we would\r\nget in communication with the other side; that some would come and some\r\nwould go. For example, your own coming was foretold by the Jarados,\r\nalmost to the hour and minute.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was fortuitous,” spoke Watson. “It was NOT the wisdom and\r\nscience of Avec, in my case.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. However, it is proof that the Rhamdas have fulfilled their\r\nduty. We knew of the Spot of Life, all the while; it was to be closed\r\nuntil we, through the effort of our intellect and virtues, could lift\r\nourselves up to the plane of the world beyond us--your world. It could\r\nnot be opened by ourselves alone, however. The Rhamda Avec had first\r\nto get in touch with your side, before he could apply the laws he had\r\ndiscovered.”\r\n\r\nSomehow, Chick admired this Rhamda. Men of his type could form but one\r\nkind of priesthood: exalted, and devoted to the advance of intelligence.\r\nIf Rhamda Avec were of the same sort, then he was a man to be looked up\r\nto, not to hate. As for the Jarados--Watson could not make out who he\r\nhad been; a prophet or teacher, seemingly, looming out of the past and\r\nreverenced from antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe Blind Spot became a shade less sinister. Already Watson had the\r\nTemple of the Leaf, or Bell, the Rhamdas and their philosophy, the great\r\namber sun, the huge birds, the musical cadence of the perfumed air, and\r\nthe counter-announcement of Rhamda Avec to weigh against the work and\r\nwords of Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\nThe world of the Blind Spot!\r\n\r\nAs if in reaction from the unaccustomed train of thought, Watson\r\nsuddenly became conscious of extreme hunger. He gave an uneasy glance\r\nround, a glance which the Rhamda Geos smilingly interpreted. At a word\r\nthe woman left the room and returned with a crimson garment, like a\r\nbath-robe. When Chick had donned it and a pair of silken slippers, Geos\r\nbade him follow.\r\n\r\nThey stepped out into the corridor.\r\n\r\nThis was formed and coloured much as the room they had quitted; and it\r\nled to another apartment, much larger--about fifty feet across--coloured\r\na deep, cool green. Its ceiling, coved like the other, seemed made of\r\nsome self-radiating substance from which came both light and heat. Four\r\nor five tables, looking like ebony work, were arranged along the side\r\nwalls. When they were seated at one of these, the Rhamda placed his\r\nfingers on some round alna-white buttons ranged along the edge of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n“In your world,” he apologised, “our clumsy service would doubtless\r\namuse you; but it is the best we have been able to devise so far.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed the button. Instantly, without the slightest sound or\r\nanything else to betray just how the thing had been accomplished,\r\nthe table was covered with golden dishes, heaped with food, and two\r\nflagon-like goblets, full to the brim with a dark, greenish liquid that\r\ngave off an aroma almost exhilarating; not alcoholic, but something just\r\nabove that. The Rhamda, disregarding or not noticing Watson's gasp\r\nof wonder, lifted his goblet in the manner of the host in health and\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\n“You may drink it,” he offered, “without fear. It is not liquor--if I\r\nmay use a word which I believe to be current in your world. I may add\r\nthat it is one of the best things that we shall be able to offer you\r\nwhile you are with us.”\r\n\r\nIndeed it wasn't liquor. Watson took a sip; and he made a mental note\r\nthat if all things in the Thomahlia were on a par with this, then he\r\ncertainly was in a world far above his own. For the one sip was enough\r\nto send a thrill through his veins, a thrill not unlike the ecstasy\r\nof supreme music--a sparkling exuberance, leaving the mind clear and\r\nscintillating, glorified to the quick thinking of genius.\r\n\r\nLater Watson experienced no reaction such as would have come from\r\ndrinking alcohol or any other drug.\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest meal ever eaten by Watson. The food was very\r\nsavoury, and perfectly cooked and served. Only one dish reminded him of\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n“You have meats?” he asked. “This looks like flesh.”\r\n\r\nGeos shook his head. “No. Do you have flesh to eat, on the other side?\r\nWe make all our food.”\r\n\r\nMAKE food. Watson thought best simply to answer the question:\r\n\r\n“As I remember it, Rhamda Geos, we had a sort of meat called beef--the\r\nflesh of certain animals.”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda was intensely interested. “Are they large? Some interpret the\r\nJarados to that effect. Tell me, are they like this?” And he pulled a\r\nsilver whistle from his pocket and, placing it to his lips, blew two\r\nshort, shrill notes.\r\n\r\nImmediately a peculiar patter sounded down the corridor; a ka-tuck,\r\nka-tuck, ka-tuck, not unlike galloping hoof-beats. Before Watson could\r\ndo any surmising a little bundle of shining black, rounded the entrance\r\nto the room and ran up to them. Geos picked it up.\r\n\r\nIt was a horse. A horse, beautifully formed, perfect as an Arab, and not\r\nmore than nine inches high!\r\n\r\nNow, Chick had been in the Blind Spot, conscious, but a short while. He\r\nknew that he was in the precise position that Rhamda Avec had occupied\r\nthat morning on the ferry-boat. Chick recalled the pictures of the\r\nLilliputian deer and the miniature kittens; yet he was immensely\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nThe little fellow began to neigh, a tiny, ridiculous sound as compared\r\nwith the blast of a normal-sized horse, and began to paw for the edge of\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“What does he want?”\r\n\r\n“A drink. They will do anything for it.” Geos pressed a button, and in\r\na moment he had another goblet. This he held before the little stallion,\r\nwho thrust his head in above his nostrils and drank as greedily as a\r\nPercheron weighing a ton. Watson stroked his sides; the mane was like\r\nspun silk, he felt the legs symmetrical, perfectly shaped, not as large\r\nabove the fetlocks as an ordinary pencil.\r\n\r\n“Are they all of this size?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; all of them. Why do you ask?”\r\n\r\n“Because”--seeing no harm in telling this--“as I remember them, a horse\r\non the other side would make a thousand of this one. People ride them.”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda nodded.\r\n\r\n“So it is told in the books of Jarados. We had such beasts, once,\r\nourselves. We would have them still, but for the brutality and stupidity\r\nof our ancestors. It is the one great sin of the Thomahlia. Once we had\r\nanimals, great and small, and all the blessings of Nature; we had horses\r\nand, I think, what you call beef; a thousand other creatures that were\r\nfood and help and companions to man. And for the good they had done our\r\nancestors destroyed them!”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“It was neglect, unthinking and selfish. A time came when our\r\ncivilisation made it possible to live without other creatures. When\r\nmachinery came into vogue we put aside the animals as useless; those we\r\nhad no further use for we denied the right to reproduce. The game of the\r\nforest was hunted down with powerful weapons of destruction; all went,\r\nin a century or two; everything that could be killed. And with them went\r\nthe age of our highest art, that age of domesticated animals.\r\n\r\n“Our greatest paintings, our noblest sculpture, came from that age; all\r\nthe priceless relics that we call classic. And in its stead we had the\r\nmechanical age. Man likewise became a mechanism, emotionless, with no\r\ntaste for Nature. Meat was made synthetically, and so was milk.”\r\n\r\n“You don't mean to say they did not preserve cows for the sake of their\r\nmilk?”\r\n\r\n“No; that kind of milk became old-fashioned; men regarded it as\r\nunsanitary, fit only for the calves. What they wanted was something\r\nchemically pure; they waged war on bacteria, microbes, and Nature\r\nin general; a cow was merely a relic whose product was always an\r\nuncertainty. With no reason for the meat and no use for the milk, our\r\nvegetarians and our purists gradually eliminated them altogether. It\r\nwas a strange age; utilitarian, scientific, selfish; it was then headed\r\nstraight for destruction.”\r\n\r\nAnd he went on to relate how men began to lose the power of emotion;\r\nthere were no dependent beasts to leaven his nature with the salt of\r\nkindness; he thought only of his own aggrandisement. He became like his\r\nmachine, a fine thing of perfectly correlated parts, but with no higher\r\nnature, no soul, no feeling; he was less than a brute. The animals\r\ndisappeared one by one, passing through the channel of death, into the\r\nworld beyond the Spot of Life, leaving behind only these tiny survivors,\r\nplaythings, kept in existence longer than all others because of a mere\r\nfad.\r\n\r\n“Does your spiritism include animals as well as men?”\r\n\r\n“Naturally; everything that is endowed with life.”\r\n\r\n“I see. Let me ask you: why didn't the Rhamdas interfere and put a stop\r\nto this wanton sacrilege against Nature?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda smiled. “You forget,” replied he, “that these events belong\r\nfar in the past. At that time the Rhamdas were not. It was even before\r\nthe coming of the Jarados.”\r\n\r\nWatson asked no more questions for a while. He wanted to think. How\r\ncould this man Rhamda Geos, if indeed he were a man, accept him, Watson,\r\nas a spirit? Solid flesh was not exactly in line with his idea of the\r\nunearthly. How to explain it? He had to go back to Holcomb again. The\r\ndoctor had accepted without question Avec's naturalness, his body,\r\nhis appetite. Reasonably enough, Geos, with some smattering of his\r\nsuperior's wisdom, should accept Watson in the same way.\r\n\r\nAnd then, the Jarados: at every moment his name had cropped up. Who was\r\nhe? So far he had heard no word that might be construed as a clue.\r\nThe great point, just now, was that the Rhamda Geos accepted him as a\r\nspirit, as the fact and substance promised by Avec. But--where was the\r\ndoctor?\r\n\r\nChick ventured this question:\r\n\r\n“My coming was foretold by the Rhamda Avec, I understand. Is this in\r\naccord with the words of the Jarados?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda looked up expectantly and spoke with evident anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Can you tell me anything about the Jarados?”\r\n\r\n“Let us forgo that,” side-stepped Watson. “Possibly I can tell you\r\nmuch that you would like to know. What I want to know is, just how well\r\nprepared you are to receive me?”\r\n\r\n“Then you come from the Jarados!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“What do you know about him?”\r\n\r\n“This: someone should have preceded me! The fact and the substance-you\r\nwere to have it inside three days! It has been several hundred times the\r\nspace allotted! Is it not so?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda's eyes were pin-pointed with eagerness.\r\n\r\n“Then it IS true! You are from the Jarados! You know the great Rhamda\r\nAvec--you have seen him!”\r\n\r\n“I have,” declared Watson.\r\n\r\n“In the other world? You can remember?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” again committing himself. “I have seen Avec--in another world.\r\nBut tell me, before we go on I would have an answer to my question: did\r\nanyone precede me?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nWatson was nonplussed, but he concealed the fact.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure?”\r\n\r\n“Quite, my dear sir. The Spot of Life was watched continually from the\r\nmoment the Rhamda left us.”\r\n\r\n“You mean, he and the Nervina?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so; she followed him after an interval of a few hours.”\r\n\r\n“I know. But you say that no one came out ahead of me. Who was it that\r\nguarded this--this Spot of Life? The Rhamdas?”\r\n\r\n“They and the Bars.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! And who are the Bars?”\r\n\r\n“The military priesthood. They are the Mahovisal, and of the Temple of\r\nthe Bell. They are led by the great Bar Senestro.”\r\n\r\n“And there were times when these Bars, led by this Senestro, held guard\r\nover the Spot of Life?” To this Geos nodded; and Watson went on: “And\r\nwho is this great Senestro?”\r\n\r\n“He is the chief of the Bars, and a prince of D'Hartia. He is the\r\naffianced of the two queens, the Aradna and the Nervina.”\r\n\r\n“The TWO of them?”\r\n\r\nWhereupon Watson learned something rather peculiar. It seemed that the\r\nprinces of D'Hartia had always married the queens. This Senestro had had\r\na brother, but he died. And in such an event it was the iron custom\r\nthat the surviving brother marry both queens. It had happened only once\r\nbefore in all history; but the precedent was unbreakable.\r\n\r\n“Then, there is nothing against it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; except, perhaps the prophecy of the Jarados. We now know--the\r\nwhole world knows--that we are fast approaching the Day of Life.”\r\n\r\n“Of course; the Day of Life.” Watson decided upon another chance shot.\r\n“It has to do with the marriage of the two queens!”\r\n\r\n“You DO know!” cried the Rhamda joyously. “Tell me!”\r\n\r\n“No; it is I who am asking the questions.”\r\n\r\nWatson's mind was working like lightning. Whether it was the influence\r\nof the strange drink, or the equally strange influence of ordinary\r\ninspiration, he was never more self-assured in his life. It seemed a day\r\nfor taking long chances.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” he inquired, “what has the Day of Life to do with the two\r\nqueens and their betrothal?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda throttled his eagerness. “It is one of the obscure points of\r\nthe prophecy. There are some scholars who hold that such a problem as\r\nthis presages the coming of the end and the advent of the chosen. But\r\nothers oppose this interpretation, for reasons purely material: for if\r\nthe Bar Senestro should marry both queens it would make him the sole\r\nruler of the Thomahlia. Only once before have we had a single ruler; for\r\ncenturies upon centuries we have had two queens; one of the D'Hartians,\r\nand the other of the Kospians, enthroned here in the Mahovisal.”\r\n\r\nWatson would have liked to learn far more. But the time seemed one for\r\naction on his part; bold action, and positive.\r\n\r\n“Rhamda Geos--I do not know what is your version of the prophecy. But\r\nyou are positive that no one preceded me out of the Spot?”\r\n\r\n“I am. Why do you persist?”\r\n\r\n“Because”--speaking slowly and with the greatest care--“because there\r\nwas one greater than I, who came before me!”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda rose excitedly to his feet, and then sank back into his chair\r\nagain. In his eyes was nothing save eagerness, wonder and respect. He\r\nleaned forward.\r\n\r\n“Who was it? Who was he?”\r\n\r\nWatson's voice was steady as stone.\r\n\r\n“The great Jarados himself!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nA LONG WAY FROM SHORE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more Watson had taken the kind of chance he preferred--a slender\r\none. He took the chance that these people, however occult and advanced\r\nthey might be, were still human enough to build their prophecy out of an\r\nold foundation. If he were right, then the person of the Jarados would\r\nbe inviolable. If the professor were prisoner, held somewhere in secret,\r\nand it got noised about that he was the true prophet returned--it would\r\nnot only give Holcomb immense prestige, but at the same time render the\r\nposition of his captors untenable.\r\n\r\nChick needed no great discernment to see that he had touched a vital\r\nspot. The philosophy of the Rhamdas was firmly bound up with spiritism;\r\nthey had gone far in science, and had passed out of mere belief into\r\nthe deeper, finer understanding that went behind the shadow for proof.\r\nCertainly Watson inwardly rejoiced to see Rhamda Geos incredulous,\r\nhis keen face whitening like that of one who has just heard sacrilege\r\nuttered--to see Geos rise in his place, grip the table tightly, and hear\r\nhim exclaim:\r\n\r\n“The Jarados! Did you say--the Jarados? He has come amongst us, and we\r\nhave not known? You are perfectly sure of this?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” stated Watson, and met the other's keen scrutiny without\r\nflinching.\r\n\r\nWould the game work? At least it promised action; and now that he had\r\nthe old feeling of himself he was anxious to get under way. Any feeling\r\nof fear was gone now. He calmly nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is so. But sit down. I have still a bit more to tell you.”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda resumed his seat. Clearly, his reverence had been greatly\r\naugmented in the past few seconds. From that time on there was a marked\r\ndifference in his manner; and his speech, when he addressed Chick,\r\ncontained the expression “my lord”--an expression that Watson found it\r\neasy enough to become accustomed to.\r\n\r\n“Did you doubt, Rhamda Geos, that I came from the Jarados?”\r\n\r\n“We did not doubt. We were certain.”\r\n\r\n“I see. You were not expecting the Jarados.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, my lord. The coming of the Jarados shall be close to the Day\r\nof the Judgment. But it could not be so soon; there were to be signs and\r\nportents. We were to solve the problem first; we were to know the reason\r\nof the shadow and the why of the spirit. The wisdom of the Rhamda Avec\r\ntold that the day approaches; he had opened the Spot of Life and gone\r\nthrough it; but he had NOT sent the fact and the substance.” Watson\r\nsmiled. There was just enough superstition, it seemed, beneath all the\r\nRhamda's wisdom to make him tractable. However, Chick asked:\r\n\r\n“Tell me: as a learned man, as a Rhamda, do you believe in the prophecy\r\nimplicitly?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord. I am a spiritist; and if spiritism is truth, then the\r\nJarados was genuine, and his prophecy is true. After all, my lord, it is\r\nnot a case of legend, but of history. The Jarados came at a time of\r\nhigh civilisation, when men would see and understand him; he gave us his\r\nteaching in records, and imposed his laws upon the Thomahlia. Then he\r\ndeparted--through the Spot of Life.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Rhamda Geos went on to say that the teachings of the Jarados had\r\nbeen moral as well as intellectual. Moreover, after he had formulated\r\nhis laws, he wrote out his judgment.\r\n\r\n“What was that?”\r\n\r\n“An exhortation, my lord, that we were to give proof of our appreciation\r\nof intelligence. We were to use it, and to prove ourselves worthy of\r\nit by lifting ourselves up to the level of the Spot of Life. In other\r\nwords, the spot would be opened when, and only when, we had learned the\r\nsecrets of the occult, and--had opened the Spot ourselves!”\r\n\r\nWatson thought he understood partly. He asked:\r\n\r\n“And that is why you doubt me?”\r\n\r\n“You, my lord? Not so! You were found in the Temple of the Bell and\r\nLeaf; not on the Spot itself, to be sure, but on the floor of the\r\ntemple. You were, both in your person and in your dress, of another\r\nworld; you had been promised by the Rhamda Avec; and, in a sense, you\r\nwere a part of the prophecy. We accepted you!”\r\n\r\n“But I speak your language. Account for that, Geos.”\r\n\r\n“It need not be accounted for, my lord. We accept it as fact. The\r\naffinity of spirit would not be bound by the limitation of artificial\r\nspeech. That you should talk the Thomahlia language is no more strange\r\nthan that Rhamda Avec, when he passed into your world, should speak your\r\ntongue.”\r\n\r\n“We call our language English,” supplied Watson. “It is the tongue of\r\nthe Jarados and of myself.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me of the Jarados, my lord!” with renewed eagerness. “In the other\r\nworld--what is he?”\r\n\r\nIt was Chick's opportunity. By telling the simple truth about Dr.\r\nHolcomb he would enhance himself in the eyes of Rhamda Geas.\r\n\r\n“In the other world--we call it America--the Jaradas is a Rhamda much\r\nlike yourself, the head and chief of many Rhamdas sitting in a great\r\ninstitution devoted to intelligence. It is called the University of\r\nCalifornia.”\r\n\r\n“And this California; what is it, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“A name,” returned Chick. “Immediately on the other side of the Spot is\r\na region called California.”\r\n\r\n“The promised land, my lord!”\r\n\r\n“The promised land indeed. There are some who call it paradise, even\r\nthere.” And for good measure he proceeded to tell much of his own land,\r\nof the woods, the rivers, the cities, animals, mountains, the sky, the\r\nmoon, and the sun. When he came to the sun he explained that no man\r\ndared to look at it continuously with the bare eyes. Its great heat and\r\nsplendour astounded Geos.\r\n\r\nConcerning himself he nonchalantly stated that he was the fiance of\r\nHolcomb's daughter; that is, son-in-law-to-be of the prophet Jarados;\r\nthat he was sort of Junior Rhamda. He declared that he had come from\r\nthe occult Rhamdas, through the other side of the Spot, in search of\r\nthe Jarados who had gone before. As to his blankness up to now, and his\r\nperplexity--he was but a Junior; and the Spot had naturally benumbed his\r\nsenses. Even now, he apologised, it was difficult to know and to recall\r\neverything clearly.\r\n\r\nThrough it all the Rhamda Geos Listened in something like awe. He\r\nwas hearing of wonders never before guessed in the Thomahlia. As the\r\nprospective son-in-law of the Jarados, Watson automatically lifted\r\nhimself to a supreme height, so great that, could he only hold himself\r\nup to it, he would have a prestige second only to that of the prophet\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden he thought of a question. It gripped him with dread,\r\nthe dread of the unknown. The question was one of TIME. “How long have I\r\nbeen here, Rhamda Geos?”\r\n\r\n“Over eleven months, by our system of reckoning. You were found on the\r\nfloor of the temple three hundred and fifty-seven days ago; you were\r\nin a lifeless condition; you must have been there some hours, my lord,\r\nbefore we discovered you.”\r\n\r\n“Eleven months!” It had seemed but that many minutes. “And I was\r\nunconscious--”\r\n\r\n“All the time, my lord. Had we caught you immediately upon your\r\ncoming, we could have brought you around within three days, but in the\r\ncircumstances it was impossible to restore you before we did. You have\r\nbeen under the care of the greatest specialists in all Thomahlia.”\r\n\r\nGeos himself had been one of these. “The council of Rhamdas went into\r\nspecial session, my lord, immediately after your materialisation, and\r\nhas been sitting almost continually since. And now that you are revived,\r\nthey are waiting in person for you to show yourself.\r\n\r\n“They accept you. They do not know who you are, my lord; none of us has\r\nguessed even a part of the truth. The entire council awaits!”\r\n\r\nBut Chick wanted more. Besides, he looked at his clothing.\r\n\r\n“I would have my own garments, Geos; also, whatever else was found on my\r\nperson.”\r\n\r\nFor Watson was thinking of a small but powerful pistol, an automatic,\r\nthat he had carried on the night when he fell through the Blind Spot.\r\nThis question of materiality was still a puzzle; if he himself had\r\nsurvived there was a chance that the firearm had done the same. It might\r\nand it might not preclude the occult. Anyway, he treasured the thought\r\nof that automatic; with it in his possession he would not be bare-handed\r\nin case of emergency.\r\n\r\nThey returned to the room in which Chick had awakened. The Rhamda left\r\nhim. A few moments later he came back with a squad of men. Chick noted\r\ntheir discipline, movement, and uniforms, and classed them as soldiers.\r\nTwo men were stationed outside the door--one, a stout, dark individual\r\nin a blue uniform; and the other a lithe, athletic chap, blond and\r\nblue-eyed, wearing a bright crimson dress. Chick instinctively preferred\r\nboth man and garb in crimson; there was a touch of honour, of lightness\r\nand strength that just suited him. The other was dark, heavy and\r\nsinister.\r\n\r\nBoth wore sandals, and upon their heads curious shakos, made of the\r\nfinest down, not fur. Both displayed a heavy silken braid looped from\r\none shoulder. Each carried a spear-like weapon, of some shining black\r\nmaterial, straight-tapered to a needle-point; but no other arms.\r\n\r\nWatson pointed to the two uniforms.\r\n\r\n“What is the significance, Geos?”\r\n\r\n“One is from the queen, my lord; the other from Bar Senestro. The blue\r\nis the cloth of the Bars; the red, that of the queens. The Bar and the\r\nqueen send this bodyguard with their respective compliments.”\r\n\r\nChick took the bundle that Geos had brought, and proceeded to don his\r\nown clothes, finding deep satisfaction in the fact that they had arrived\r\nas intact as he. He felt carefully in his hip pocket; the automatic\r\nwas still there, likewise the extra magazine of cartridges that he had\r\ncarried about with him on that night.\r\n\r\nIn his other pockets he found two packets of cigarettes, a pouch of\r\ntobacco, some papers, a few coins, a little money and two photographs,\r\none of Bertha and the other of her father. Not a thing had been\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nHe announced himself ready.\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda conducted him down the corridor, which he found to be lined\r\nwith guards; red on one side, blue on the other. These men fell in\r\nbehind in two parallel files, one of the one colour and one of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt was a building of great size. The corridors were long and high, all\r\nwith the wide-coved ceiling, and of colours that melted from one shade\r\nto another as they turned, not corners, but curves. Apparently each\r\ncolour had its own suggestive reason. Such rooms as Chick could look\r\ninto were uniformly large, beautiful, and distinctly lighted.\r\n\r\nThe guard moved in silent rhythm; the chief sound was that made by\r\nWatson's leather-heeled shoes, drowning out, for once, the everlasting\r\ntinkling undertone of those unseen fairy-bells; that running cadence,\r\nnever ceasing, silver, liquid, like the soul of sound.\r\n\r\nThough Watson walked with head erect, he had eyes for every little thing\r\nhe passed. He noted the material of the structure and tried to name it;\r\nneither plaster nor stone, the walls were highly polished and, somehow\r\nor other, capable of emitting perfume--light and wholesome, not heavy\r\nand oppressive. And in dark passages the walls glowed.\r\n\r\nThe corridor widened, and with a graceful curve opened upon a wide\r\nstairway that descended, or rather sank--to use Watson's own words\r\nfor the feeling--into the depths of the building. To the right of one\r\nlanding was a large window reaching to the floor; its panes were clear\r\nand not frosted as had been the others.\r\n\r\nChick got his first glimpse here of what lay outside--an iridescent\r\nlandscape, at first view astonishingly like an ocean of opals; for it\r\nwas of many hues, red and purple and milky white, splashed violantin\r\nblue and fluorescence--a maze and shimmer of dancing, joyful colours,\r\nwhirring in an uncertainty of polychromatic harmony. Such was his first\r\nfleeting impression.\r\n\r\nAt the next landing he looked closer. It was not unlike a monster\r\nbowl of bubbles; the same illusion of movement, the same delicacy\r\nand witchery of colour, only here the sensation was not that of\r\ndecomposition but of life; of flowers, delicate as the rainbow, tenuous,\r\nsinuous, breathing--weaving in a serpentine maze of daedalian hues; long\r\ntendrils of orchidian beauty, lifting, weaving, drooping--a vast sea of\r\nequatorial bloom; but--no trees.\r\n\r\n“This is our landscape,” spoke the Rhamda. “According to the Jarados, it\r\nis not like that of the next world--your world, my lord. After you meet\r\nthe Rhamdas, I shall take you into the Mahovisal for a closer view of it\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nThey reached the bottom of the stairway. Chick noted the architecture in\r\nthe entrance-way at this point; the seeming solidness of structure, as\r\nif the whole had been chiselled, not built. The vestibule was really\r\na hall, domed and high, large enough to shelter a hundred. Like the\r\ncorridor outside Chick's room, it was lined with a row each of red and\r\nblue uniformed guards.\r\n\r\nInvariably the one belonged to the blond, lithe, quick-feeling type,\r\nthe others heavy, sturdy, formidable. The extremities of the two lines\r\nconverged on an oval-topped doorway, very large, having above it a\r\ndesign conventionalised from the three-leafed clover. One leaf was\r\nscarlet, one blue, the other green.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. The guards halted. Geos stepped aside with a bow, and\r\nWatson strode forward into the presence of the Council of the Rhamdas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE BAR SENESTRO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a critical moment for Chick. Out of the impulse of his inner\r\nnature he had chosen the odds that he must now uphold against the\r\ncombined wisdom of these intellectuals. He was alone, with no one\r\nto guide him save Geos, who undoubtedly was his friend, but who as\r\nundoubtedly would desert him upon the slightest inkling of imposture.\r\n\r\nHe found himself in a great, round room, or rather an oval one, domed at\r\nthe top but tinted in a far more beautiful colouring--lazuli blue. The\r\nwalls were cut by long, narrow windows reaching far up into the sweep\r\nwhere the side melted into the ceiling. The material of the windows was\r\nof the same translucent substance already noted, but slightly tinged\r\nwith green, so that they shed a soft light, cooled and quiet, over the\r\nwhole assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the wall opposite the doorway was a large replica of the clover-leaf\r\ndesign outside, even more gem-like in brilliance; its three colours\r\nwoven into a trinity almost of flame. Whether the light was artificial\r\nor intrinsic, Chick could not say. The floor of the place accommodated\r\nsome three hundred tables, of the library type, and the same number\r\nof men bearing the distinguished stamp of the Rhamda. All were\r\nsmooth-shaven, comparatively tall, and possessing the same aesthetic\r\nmanner which impressed one with the notion of inherited, inherent\r\nculture. The entire hall had the atmosphere of learning, justice and the\r\nsupreme tribunal.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Watson felt weak and uncertain. He could hold up against\r\nGeos and Avec, but in the face of such an array he wasn't so sure. There\r\nwas but one thing to encourage him; the faces into which he looked. All\r\nwere full of wonder and reverence.\r\n\r\nThen he looked about him more carefully. He had come out upon a wide\r\nplatform, or rostrum. He now noticed that he was flanked on either side\r\nby thrones--two of them; they seemed made of golden amber. The one on\r\nthe right was occupied by a man, the other by a woman. In the pause that\r\nwas vouchsafed him Chick took note of these two, and wondered.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the man was not a Rhamda. The jewelled semi-armour\r\nthat he wore was more significant than the dignified garb of the\r\nIntellectuals; at the same time, his accoutrements cheapened him, by\r\ncontrast. He was executive, princely, with the bearing that comes of\r\nworldly ambitions and attainments; a man strangely handsome, vital,\r\nathletic; curling hair, dark, quick eyes and even features; except\r\nonly for the mouth he might have been taken as a model of the Greek\r\nAlexander.\r\n\r\nThe clothes he wore were classic, as was everything else about him, even\r\nto his sandals, his bare arms and his jewelled breastplate.\r\n\r\nWatson had studied history. He had a quick impression of a composite--of\r\ngenius, cruelty and sensuality. Here was one with three strong natures,\r\na sort of Nero, Caligula and Alexander combined: the sensuality of the\r\nfirst, the cruelty of the second, and the instinctive fire and greatness\r\nof the immortal Macedonian. The man was smiling; not an amused smile,\r\nbut one of interest, humorous tolerance.\r\n\r\nWhen their eyes met, Chick caught the magnetic current of personality,\r\nthe same sense of illusiveness that he and Harry Wendel had noted in\r\nthe Nervina; only here it was negative, resisting instead of aiding.\r\nA number of the blue guard surrounded the throne, their faces dark,\r\nstrong, and of unconquerable resolution, though slow to think.\r\n\r\nOn the other throne was a girl. Chick had heard enough from the Geos to\r\nguess her identity: one of the queens, the Aradna; frail, delicate, a\r\nblue-eyed maiden, with a waving mass of straw-gold hair hanging loosely\r\nabout her shoulders. She too was classically attired, although there\r\nwere touches of modernity here and there in the arrangement of ribbons;\r\nthe garment matched her guards' crimson, and was draped about her\r\nshoulders so as to leave one bare, together with that arm. Across her\r\nforehead was a band of dark-blue gems, and she wore no other jewels.\r\n\r\nShe was not more than seventeen or eighteen, with eyes like bluebells,\r\nlips as red as poppies, features that danced with delight and laughter\r\nand all the innocence that one would associate with elfin royalty.\r\nInstinctively Chick compared her with the Nervina.\r\n\r\nThe senior queen had the subtle magnetism, the uncountable fascination,\r\nthe poise and decision that held and dictated all things to her fancy.\r\n\r\nNot so the Aradna. Hers was the strength of simplicity, the frank, open\r\ndelight of the maiden, and at the same time all the charm and suggestion\r\nof coming womanhood. When she caught Watson's eye she smiled; a smile\r\nfree and unrestrained, out of an open, happy heart. She made a remark\r\nto one of her guards, who nodded a reply after the manner of a friend,\r\nrather than a courtier.\r\n\r\nWatson turned to the Geos, who stood somewhat to one side, and a little\r\nto the rear.\r\n\r\n“The Aradna?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. The queen of D'Hartia. The man on the other side is the Bar\r\nSenestro.”\r\n\r\nWhatever feeling Chick entertained for the one was offset by what he\r\nfelt for the other. He was between two forces; his instinct warned him\r\nof the Bar, sceptical, powerful, ruthless, a man to be reckoned with;\r\nbut his better nature went out to the young queen.\r\n\r\nAt a motion from Geos, the whole assembly of Rhamdas stood up. The\r\naction was both dignified and reverent. Though Chick was, in their eyes,\r\na miracle, there was no unseemly staring nor jarring of curiosity; all\r\nwas quietness, ease, poise; the only sound was that of the constant\r\nsubtle music of those invisible bells.\r\n\r\nRhamda Geos began speaking. At the same time he placed a friendly hand\r\non Watson's shoulder, a signal for every other Rhamda to resume his\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n“The Fact and the Substance, my brothers.”\r\n\r\nGeos paused as he made use of the ultra-significant phrase. And then,\r\nin a few rapid sentences, he ran over the synopsis of that affair,\r\nbeginning with some philosophy and other details that Watson could only\r\nhalf understand, making frequent allusions to the Jarados and other\r\nwriters of prophecy; then he made some mention of his own particular\r\nbrand of spiritism and its stand on materialisation. This he followed\r\nwith an account of the finding of Watson in the temple, his long sleep\r\nand ultimate reviving. At greater length he repeated the gist of their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nNot until then was there a stir among the Rhamdas. Chick glanced over at\r\nthe Aradna. She was listening eagerly, her chin cupped in her hand,\r\nher blue eyes full of interest and wonder, and natural, unfeigned,\r\nchild-like delight.\r\n\r\nThen the Bar caught Chick's glance; the newcomer felt the cold chill of\r\ncalculation, the cynical weight of the sceptic, and a queer foreboding\r\nof the future; no light glance, but one like fire and ice and iron.\r\nHe wondered at the man's beauty and genius, and at his emotional\r\npreponderance manifest even here before the Rhamdas.\r\n\r\nThe Geos went on. His words, now, were simple and direct. Watson felt\r\nhimself almost deified by that reverent manner. The Rhamdas listened\r\nwith visibly growing interest; the Aradna leaned slightly forward; even\r\nthe Bar dropped his interest in Watson to pay closer attention to the\r\nspeaker. For Geos had come to the Jarados; he was an orator as well as\r\na mystic, and he was advancing Chick's words with all the skill of a\r\nmaster of language, ascending effect--climax--the Jarados had come among\r\nthem, and--They had missed him!\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was silence, then a rustle of general comment. Chick\r\nwatched the Rhamdas, leaning over to whisper to each other. Could he\r\nstand up against them?\r\n\r\nBut none of them spoke. After the first murmur of comment they lapsed\r\ninto silence again. It was the Bar Senestro who broke the tension.\r\n\r\n“May I ask, Rhamda Geos, why you make such an assertion? What proof have\r\nyou, to begin with, that this man,” indicating Watson with a nod, “is\r\nnot merely one of ourselves: a D'Hartian or a Kospian?”\r\n\r\nThe Geos replied instantly: “You know the manner of his discovery, Bar\r\nSenestro. Have you not eyes?” Geos seemed to think he had said the last\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” rejoined the Bar good-humouredly. “I have very good eyes,\r\nRhamda Geos. Likewise I have a mind to reason with; but my imagination,\r\nI fear, is defective. What I behold is just such a creature as myself;\r\nnot otherwise. How hold you that this one is proof out of the occult?”\r\n\r\n“You are sceptical,” returned the Rhamda, evenly. “Even as you behold\r\nhim, you are full of doubt. But do you not recall the words of the great\r\nAvec? Do you not know the Prophecy of the Jarados?”\r\n\r\n“Truly, Geos; I remember them both. Especially the writing on the wall\r\nof the temple. Does not the prophet himself say: 'And behold, in the\r\nlast days there shall come among ye--the false ones. Them ye shall\r\nslay'?”\r\n\r\n“All very true, Bar Senestro. But you well know--we all know--that the\r\ntrue prophecy was to be fulfilled when the Spot was opened. Did not the\r\nfulfilment begin when the Avec and the Nervina passed through to the\r\nother side?”\r\n\r\n“The fulfilment, Geos? Perhaps it was the sign of the coming of\r\nimpostors! The end may not be until ALL the conditions are complied\r\nwith!”\r\n\r\nBut at this moment Aradna saw fit to speak.\r\n\r\n“Senestro, would you condemn this one without allowing him a word in his\r\nown defence? Is it fair? Besides, he does not look like an impostor to\r\nme. I like his face. Perhaps he is one of the chosen!”\r\n\r\nAt the last word the Bar frowned. His glance shifted suddenly to Watson,\r\na swift look of ice-cold calculation.\r\n\r\n“Very, very true, O Aradna. I, too, would have him speak in his own\r\nbehalf. Let him amuse us with his tongue. What would your majesty care\r\nto hear, O Aradna, from this phantom?”\r\n\r\nThe words were of biting satire. Chick wheeled upon the Bar. Their eyes\r\nclashed; an encounter not altogether to Watson's credit. He was a bit\r\nunsteady, a trifle uncertain of his power. He had calculated on the\r\nsuperstition of the Rhamdas to hold him up until he caught his footing,\r\nand this unexpected scepticism was disconcerting. However, he was no\r\ncoward; the feeling passed away almost at once. He strode straight up to\r\nthe throne of the Bar; and once more he spoke from sheer impulse:\r\n\r\n“The Aradna has spoken true, O Senestro, or sinister, or whatever you\r\nmay be called. I demand fair hearing! It is my due; for I have come from\r\nanother world. I follow--the Jarados!”\r\n\r\nIf Watson had supposed that he had taken the Bar's measure, he was\r\nmistaken. The prince's eyes suddenly glinted with a fierce pleasure.\r\nLike a flash his antagonism shifted to something astonishingly like\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n“Well spoken! Incidentally, you are well made and sound looking,\r\nstranger.”\r\n\r\n“Passably,” replied Watson. “I do not care to discuss my appearance,\r\nhowever. I am certainly no more ill-favoured than some others.”\r\n\r\n“And impertinent,” continued the other, quite without malice. “Do you\r\nknow anything about the Bar, to whom you speak so saucily?”\r\n\r\n“I know that you have intimated that I may be an impostor. You have done\r\nthis, after hearing what the learned Rhamda Geos has said. You know the\r\nfacts; you know that I have come from the Jarados. I--”\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't Watson's words that held the Bar's attention. Chick's\r\nstraight, well-knit form, his quick-trained actions, overbalanced\r\nthe question of the prophet in the mind of the man on the throne. His\r\ndelight was self-evident.\r\n\r\n“Truly you are soundly built, stranger; you are made of iron and\r\nwhipcord, finely formed, quick and alert.” He threw a word to one of his\r\nheavy-faced attendants, then suddenly stood up and descended from his\r\nthrone. He came up and stood beside Watson.\r\n\r\nChick straightened. The prince was an inch the taller; his bare arms\r\nlong-muscled, lithe, powerful; under the pink skin Chick could see the\r\ndelicate, cat-like play of strength and vitality. He sensed the strength\r\nof the man, his quick, eager, instinctive glance, his panther-like step\r\nand certainty of graceful movement.\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” spoke the Bar, “indeed you ARE an athlete! What is your\r\nnationality--Kospian?”\r\n\r\n“Neither Kospian nor D'Hartian; I am an American. True, there are some\r\nwho have said that I am built like a man; I pride myself that I can\r\nconduct myself like one.”\r\n\r\n“And speak impertinently.” Still in the best of humour, the prince\r\ncoolly reached out and felt Watson's biceps. His eyes became still\r\nbrighter. If not an admirer of decorum, he could appreciate firm flesh.\r\n“Sirra! You ARE strong! Answer me--do you know anything about games of\r\nviolence?”\r\n\r\n“Several. Anything you choose.”\r\n\r\nBut the prince shook his head. “Not so. I claim no unfair advantage; you\r\nare well met, and opportune. Let it be a contest of your own choosing.\r\nThe greater honour to myself, the victor!”\r\n\r\nBut the little queen saw fit to interfere.\r\n\r\n“Senestro, is this the code of the Bar? Is not your proposal unseemly to\r\nso great a guest? Restrain your eagerness for strength and for muscle!\r\nYou have preferred charges against this man; now you would hurl your\r\nbody as well. Remember, I am the queen; I can command it of you.”\r\n\r\nThe Senestro bowed.\r\n\r\n“Your wishes are my law, O Aradna.” Then, turning to Watson: “I am\r\nover-eager, stranger. You are the best-built man I have seen for many\r\na circle. But I shall best you.” He paced to his throne and resumed his\r\nseat. “Let him tell us his tale. I repeat, Geos, that for all his beauty\r\nthis one is an impostor. When he has spoken I shall confute him. I ask\r\nonly that in the end he be turned over to me.”\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the Thomahlia was blest with odd rulers. If the Bar\r\nSenestro was a priest, he was clearly still more of a soldier. The fiery\r\nchallenge of the man struck an answering chord in Watson; he knew the\r\ntime must come when he should weigh himself up against this Alexander,\r\nand it was anything but displeasing to him.\r\n\r\n“What must I say and do?” he asked the Rhamda Geos. “What do they want\r\nme to tell them?”\r\n\r\n“Just what you have told me: tell them of the Nervina, and of the Rhamda\r\nAvec. The prince is a man of the world, but from the Rhamdas you will\r\nhave justice.”\r\n\r\nWhereat Chick addressed the Intellectuals. They seemed accustomed to the\r\noutbursts of the handsome Bar, and were now waiting complacently. In\r\na few words Watson described the Nervina and Avec; their appearance,\r\nmanners--everything. Fortunately he did not have to dissemble. When he\r\nhad finished there was a faint murmur of approval.\r\n\r\n“It is proven,” declared the girl queen. “It is truly my cousin, the\r\nNervina. I knew not the Rhamda, but from your faces it must have been\r\nhe, Senestro, what say you to this?”\r\n\r\nBut the Bar was totally unconvinced.\r\n\r\n“All this is childish. Did I not say he is of our world--D'Hartian or\r\nKospian, or some other? Does not all Thomahlia know of the Nervina? Few\r\nhave seen the Rhamda Avec, but what of it? Some have. What this stranger\r\nsays proves nothing at all. I say, give him a test.”\r\n\r\n“The test?” from Geos, in a hushed tone.\r\n\r\n“Just that. There is none who knows the likeness of the Jarados; none\r\nbut the absent Avec. None among us has ever seen his image. It is a\r\nsecret to all save the High Rhamda. Yet, in cases like this, well may\r\nthe Leaf be opened.”\r\n\r\nWatson, wondering what was meant, listened closely to the prince as he\r\ncontinued: “It is written that there are times when all may see. Surely\r\nthis is such a time.\r\n\r\n“Now let this stranger describe the Jarados. He says that he had seen\r\nhim; that he is the Prophet's prospective son-in-law. Good! Let him\r\ndescribe the Jarados to us!\r\n\r\n“Then open the Leaf! If he speaks true, we shall know him to be from the\r\nJarados. If he fail, then I shall claim him for purposes of my own.”\r\n\r\nWhatever the motives of the Senestro, he surely had the genius of quick\r\ndecision. Watson knew that the moment had come to test his luck to the\r\nuttermost. There was but one thing to do; he did it. He said to the\r\nRhamda Geos, in a tone of the utmost indifference:\r\n\r\n“I am willing.”\r\n\r\nGeos was distinctively relieved, “It is good, my lord. Tell us in simple\r\nwords. Describe the Jarados just as you have seen him, just as you would\r\nhave us see him. Afterwards we shall open the Leaf.” And in a lower\r\ntone: “If you speak accurately I shall be vindicated, my lord. I doubt\r\nnot that you are a better man than the prince; but place your reliance\r\nin the Truth; it will be one more proof of the occult, and of the Day\r\napproaching.”\r\n\r\nWhich is all that Watson told. But first he breathed a prayer to One who\r\nis above all things occult or physical. He did not understand where he\r\nwas nor how he had got there; he only knew that his fate was hanging on\r\na toss of chance.\r\n\r\nHe faced the Rhamdas without flinching; and half closing his eyes and\r\nspeaking very clearly, he searched his memory for what he recalled of\r\nthe old professor. He tried to describe him just as he had appeared that\r\nday in the ethics class, when he made the great announcement; the trim,\r\nstubby figure of Professor Holcomb, the pink, healthy skin, the wise,\r\ngrey, kindly eyes, and the close-cropped, pure white beard: all, just as\r\nChick had known him. One chance in millions; he took it.\r\n\r\n“That is the Jarados as I have seen him; a short, elderly, wise, BEARDED\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nThere was not a breath or a murmur in comment. All hung upon his words;\r\nthere was not a sound in the room as he ceased speaking, only the throb\r\nof his own heart and the subtle pounding of caution in his veins. He had\r\nspoken. If only there might be a resemblance!\r\n\r\nThe Geos stepped forward a pace. “It is well said. If the truth has been\r\nspoken, there shall be room for no dispute. It shall be known throughout\r\nall Thomahlia that the Chosen of the Jarados has spoken. Let the Leaf be\r\nopened!”\r\n\r\nChick never knew just what happened, much less how it was accomplished.\r\nHe knew only that a black, opaque wave ran up the long windows, shutting\r\noff the light, so that instantly the darkness of night enveloped\r\neverything, blotting out all that maze of colour; it was the blackness\r\nof the void. Then came a tiny light, a mere dot of flame, over on the\r\nopposite wall; a pin-point of light it was, seemingly coming out of\r\na vast distance like an approaching star, growing gradually larger,\r\nspreading out into a screen of radiance that presently was flashing\r\nwith intrinsic life. The corruscation grew brighter; little tufts of\r\nbrilliance shot out with all the stabbing suddenness of shooting stars.\r\nTo Chick it was exactly as though some god were pushing his way through\r\nand out of fire. In the end the flame burst asunder, diminished into a\r\nreceding circle and sputtered out.\r\n\r\nAnd in the place of the strange light there appeared the illuminated\r\nfigure of a man. Leaning forward, Chick rubbed his eyes and looked\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt was the bust of Professor Holcomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nTHE PERFECT IMPOSTOR\r\n\r\n\r\nChick gasped. Of all that assemblage--Rhamdas, guards, the occupants\r\nof the two thrones--he himself was the most astounded. Was the great\r\nprofessor in actual fact the true Jarados? If not, how explain this\r\nmiracle? But if he were, how to explain the duality, the identity?\r\nSurely, it could not be sheer chance!\r\n\r\nFortunately for Chick, it was dark. All eyes were fixed on the trim\r\nfigure which occupied the space of the clover-leaf on the rear wall.\r\nExcept for Chick's strangled gasp, there was only the hushed silence of\r\nreverence, deep and impressive.\r\n\r\nThen another dot appeared. From its position, Watson took it to come\r\nfrom another leaf of the clover; another light approaching out of the\r\nvoid and cutting through the blackness exactly as the first had come.\r\nIt grew and spread until it had filled the whole leaf; then, again\r\nthe bursting of the flare, the diminishing of the light, and its\r\ndisappearance in a thin rim at the edge. And this time there was\r\nrevealed--\r\n\r\nA handsome brown-haired DOG.\r\n\r\nWatson of course, could not understand. The silence held; he could feel\r\nthe Rhamda Geos at his side, and hear him murmur something which, in\r\nitself, was quite unintelligible:\r\n\r\n“The four-footed one! The call to humility, sacrifice, and\r\nunselfishness! The four-footed one!”\r\n\r\nThat was all. It was a shaggy shepherd dog, with a pointed nose and one\r\near cocked up and the other down, very wisely inquisitive. Chick had\r\nseen similar dogs many times, but he could not account for this one;\r\ncertainly not in such a place. What had it to do with the Jarados?\r\n\r\nStill the darkness. It gave him a chance to think. He wondered, rapidly,\r\nhow he could link up such a creature with his description of the\r\nJarados. What could be the purpose of a canine in occult philosophy? Or,\r\nwas the whole thing, after all, mere blundering chance?\r\n\r\nThis is what bothered Chick. He did not know how to adjust himself;\r\nlife, place, sequence, were all out of order. Until he could gather\r\nexact data, he must trust to intuition as before.\r\n\r\nThe two pictures vanished simultaneously. Down came the black waves from\r\nthe windows, gradually, and in a moment the room was once more flooded\r\nwith that mellow radiance. The Rhamda Geos stepped forward as a murmur\r\nof awed approval arose from the assembly. There was no applause. One\r\ndoes not applaud the miraculous. The Geos took his hand.\r\n\r\n“It is proven!” he declared. Then, to the Rhamdas: “Is there any\r\nquestion, my brothers?”\r\n\r\nBut no word came from the floor. Seemingly superstition had triumphed\r\nover all else. The men of learning turned none but reverent faces toward\r\nWatson.\r\n\r\nHe forebore to glance at the Bar Senestro. Despite the triumph he\r\nwas apprehensive of the princes's keen genius. An agnostic is seldom\r\nconverted by what could be explained away as mere coincidence. Moreover,\r\nas it ultimately appeared, the Bar now had more than one reason for\r\nantagonising the man who claimed to be the professor's prospective\r\nson-in-law.\r\n\r\n“Is there any question?” repeated Rhamda Geos.\r\n\r\nBut to the surprise of Chick, it came from the queen. She was standing\r\nbefore her throne now. Around her waist a girdle of satin revealed the\r\ntender frailty of her figure. She gave Watson a close scrutiny, and then\r\naddressed the Geos:\r\n\r\n“I want to put one question, Rhamda. The stranger seems to be a goodly\r\nyoung man. He has come from the Jarados. Tell me, is he truly of the\r\nchosen?”\r\n\r\nBut a clear, derisive laugh from the opposite throne interrupted the\r\nanswer. The Bar stood up, his black eyes dancing with mocking laughter.\r\n\r\n“The chosen, O Aradna? The chosen? Do not allow yourself to be tricked\r\nby a little thing! I myself have been chosen by the inherited law of the\r\nThomahlia!” Then to Chick: “I see, Sir Phantom, that our futures are to\r\nbe intertwined with interest!”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“No? Very good; if you are really come out of superstition, then I shall\r\nteach you the value of materiality. You are well made and handsome,\r\nlikewise courageous. May the time soon come when you can put your mettle\r\nto the test in a fair conflict!”\r\n\r\n“It is your own saying, O Senestro!” warned Geos. “You must abide by my\r\nLord's reply.”\r\n\r\n“True; and I shall abide. I know nothing of black magic, or any other.\r\nBut I care not. I know only that I cannot accept this stranger as a\r\nspirit. I have felt his muscles, and I know his strength; they are a\r\nman's, and a Thomahlian's.”\r\n\r\n“Then you do not abide?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do. That is, I do not claim him. He has won his freedom. But\r\nas for endorsing him--no, not until he has given further proof. Let him\r\ncome to the Spot of Life. Let him take the ordeal. Let him qualify on\r\nthe Day of the Prophet.”\r\n\r\n“My lord, do you accept?”\r\n\r\nWatson had no idea what the “ordeal” might be, nor what might be the\r\nsignificance of the day. But he could not very well refuse. He spoke as\r\nlightly as he could.\r\n\r\n“Of course. I accept anything.” Then, addressing the prince: “One word,\r\nO Senestro.”\r\n\r\n“Speak up, Sir Phantom!”\r\n\r\n“Bar Senestro--what have you done with the Jarados?”\r\n\r\nAn instant's stunned silence greeted this stab. It was broken by the\r\nprince.\r\n\r\n“The Jarados!” His voice was unruffled. “What know I of the Jarados?”\r\n\r\n“Take care! You have seen him--you know his power!”\r\n\r\n“You have a courageous sort of impertinence!”\r\n\r\n“I have determination and knowledge! Bar Senestro, I have come for the\r\nJarados!” Chick paused for effect. “Now what think you? Am I of the\r\nchosen?”\r\n\r\nHe had meant it as a deliberate taunt, and so it was taken. The Bar shot\r\nto his feet. Not that he was angered; his straight, handsome form was\r\nkingly, and for all his impulsiveness there was a certain real majesty\r\nabout his every pose.\r\n\r\n“You are of the chosen. It is well; you have given spice to the taunt!\r\nI would not have it otherwise. Forget not your courage on the Day of the\r\nProphet!”\r\n\r\nWith that he stepped gracefully, superbly from the dais beneath\r\nhis throne. He bowed to the Aradna, to Geos, to Chick and to the\r\nassembly--and was gone. The blue guard followed in silence.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the ordeal was soon done. Nothing more was said about the\r\nJarados, nor of what the Bar Senestro had brought up. There were a few\r\nquestions about the world he had quit, questions which put no strain\r\nupon his imagination to answer. He was out of the deep water for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nWhen the assembly dissolved Chick was conducted back to the apartments\r\nupstairs. Not to his old room, however, but to an adjoining suite, a\r\nmagnificent place--that would have done honour to a prince. But Chick\r\nscarcely noted the beauty of the place. His attention flew at once to\r\nsomething for which he longed--an immense globe.\r\n\r\nChick spun it around eagerly upon its axis. The first thing that he\r\nlooked for was San Francisco--or, rather, North America. If he was on\r\nthe earth he wanted to know it! Surely the oceans and continents would\r\nnot change.\r\n\r\nBut he was doomed to disappointment. There was not a familiar detail.\r\nOutside of a network of curved lines indicating latitude and longitude,\r\nand the accustomed tilt of the polar axis, the globe was totally\r\nstrange! So strange that Chick could not decide which was water and\r\nwhich land.\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of puzzling Chick ran across a yellow patch marked with\r\nsome strange characters which, upon examination, were translated in some\r\nunknown manner within his subconscious mind, to “D'Hartia.” Another was\r\nlettered “Kospia.”\r\n\r\nAssuming that these were land--and there were a few other, smaller ones,\r\nof the same shade--then the land area covered approximately three-fifths\r\nof the globe. Inferentially the green remainder, or two-fifths, was the\r\nwater or ocean covered area. Such a proportion was nearly the precise\r\nreverse of that obtaining on the earth. Chick puzzled over other strange\r\nnames--H'Alara, Mal Somnal, Bloudou San, and the like. Not one name or\r\noutline that he could place!\r\n\r\nHow could he make his discovery fit with the words of Dr. Holcomb, and\r\nwith what philosophy he knew? Somehow there was too much life, too much\r\nreality, to fit in with any spiritistic hypothesis. He was surrounded by\r\nreal matter, atomic, molecular, cellular. He was certain that if he were\r\nput to it he could prove right here every law from those put forth by\r\nNewton to the present.\r\n\r\nIt was still the material universe; that was certain. Therefor it was\r\nequally certain that the doctor had made a most prodigious discovery.\r\nBut--what was it? What was the law that had fallen out of the Blind\r\nSpot?\r\n\r\nHe gave it up, and stepped to one of the suite's numerous windows.\r\nThey were all provided with clear glass. Now was his opportunity for an\r\nuninterrupted, leisurely survey of the world about him.\r\n\r\nAs before, he noted the maze of splendid, dazzling opalescence, all the\r\ncolours of the spectrum blending, weaving, vibrant, like a vast plain\r\nof smooth, Gargantuan jewels. Then he made out innumerable round domes,\r\nspread out in rows and in curves, without seeming order or system;\r\nBUILDINGS, every roof a perfect gleaming dome, its surface fairly alive\r\nwith the reflected light of that amazing sun. Of such was the landscape\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAs before, he could hear the incessant undertone of vague music, of\r\nrhythmical, shimmering and whispering sound. And the whole air was laden\r\nwith the hint of sweet scents; tinged with the perfume of attar and\r\nmyrrh--of a most delicate ambrosia.\r\n\r\nHe opened the window.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stood still, the air bathing his face, the unknown\r\nfragrance filling his nostrils. The whole world seemed thrumming with\r\nthat hitherto faint quiver of sound. Now it was resonant and strong,\r\nthough still only an undertone. He looked below him; as he did so,\r\nsomething dropped from the side of the window opening--a long, delicate\r\ntendril, sinuous and alive. It touched his face, and then--It drooped,\r\ndrooped like a wounded thing. He reached out his hand and plucked it,\r\nwondering. And he found, at its tip, a floating crimson blossom as\r\ndelicate as the frailest cobweb, so inconceivably delicate that it\r\nwilted and crumbled at the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nChick thrust his head out of the window. The whole building, from ground\r\nto dome, was covered--waving, moving, tenuous, a maze of colour--with\r\norchids!\r\n\r\nHe had never dreamed of anything so beautiful, or so splendid.\r\nEverywhere these orchids; to give them the name nearest to the unknown\r\none. As far as he could see, living beauty!\r\n\r\nAnd then he noticed something stranger still.\r\n\r\nFrom the petals and the foliage about him, little clouds of colour\r\nwafted up, like mists of perfume, forever rising and intermittently\r\nsettling. It was mysteriously harmonious, continuous--like life itself.\r\nChick looked closer, and listened. And then he knew.\r\n\r\nThese mists were clouds of tiny, multi-coloured insects.\r\n\r\nHe looked down farther, into the streets. They were teeming with life,\r\nwith motion. He was in a city whose size made it a true metropolis.\r\nAll the buildings were large, and, although of unfamiliar architecture,\r\nundeniably of a refined, advanced art. Without exception, their roofs\r\nwere domed. Hence the effect of a sea of bubbles.\r\n\r\nDirectly below, straight down from his window, was a very broad street.\r\nFrom it at varying angles ran a number of intersecting avenues. The\r\nheight of his window was great--he looked very closely, and made out\r\ntwo lines of colour lining and outlining the street surrounding the\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nOn the one side the line was blue, on the other crimson; they were\r\nguards. And where the various avenues intersected cables must have\r\nbeen stretched; for these streets were packed and jammed with a surging\r\nmultitude, which the guards seemed engaged in holding back. As far up\r\nthe avenues as Chick could see, the seething mass of fellow creatures\r\nextended, a gently pulsing vari-coloured potential commotion.\r\n\r\nAs he looked one of the packed streets broke into confusion. He could\r\nsee the guards wheeling and running into formation; from behind, other\r\nplatoons rushed up reinforcements. The great crowd was rolling forward,\r\nbreaking on the edge of the spear-armed guards like the surf of a\r\nrolling sea.\r\n\r\nChick had a sudden thought. Were they not looking up at his window? He\r\ncould glimpse arms uplifted and hands pointed. Even the guards, those\r\nheld in reserve, looked up. Then--such was the distance--the rumble of\r\nthe mob reached his ears; at the same time, spreading like a grass fire,\r\nthe commotion broke out in another street, to another and another, until\r\nthe air was filled with the new undertone of countless human tongues.\r\n\r\nChick was fascinated. The thing was over-strange. While he looked and\r\nlistened the whole scene turned to conflict; the voice of the throng\r\nbecame ominous. The guards still held the cables, still beat back the\r\npopulace. Could they hold out, wondered Chick idly; and what was it all\r\nabout?\r\n\r\nSomething touched his shoulder. He wheeled. One of the tall,\r\nred-uniformed guards was standing beside him. Watson instinctively drew\r\nback, and as he did so the other stepped forward, touched the snap, and\r\nclosed the window.\r\n\r\n“What's the idea? I was just getting interested!”\r\n\r\nThe soldier nodded pleasantly, respectfully--reverently.\r\n\r\n“Orders from below, my lord. Were you to remain at that window it would\r\ntake all the guards in the Mahovisal to keep back the Thomahlians.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Chick was astonished.\r\n\r\n“There are a million pilgrims in the city, my lord, who have waited\r\nmonths for just one glimpse of you.”\r\n\r\nWatson considered. This was a new and a dazing aspect of the affair.\r\nEvidently the expression on his face told the soldier that some\r\nexplanation would not be amiss.\r\n\r\n“The pilgrims are almost innumerable, my lord. They are all of the one\r\ngreat faith. They are, my lord, the true believers, the believers in the\r\nDay.”\r\n\r\nThe Day! Instantly Watson recalled Senestro's use of the expression. He\r\nsensed a valuable clue. He caught and held the soldier's eye.\r\n\r\n“Tell me,” commanded Chick. “What is this Day of which you speak!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nAN ALLY, AND SOLID GROUND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldier replied unhesitatingly: “It is the Day of Life, my lord.\r\nOthers call it the 'first of the Sixteen Days.' Still others, simply the\r\nDay of the Prophet, or Jarados.”\r\n\r\n“When will it be?”\r\n\r\n“Soon. It is but two days hence. And with the going down of the sun on\r\nthat day the Fulfilment is to begin, and the Life is to come. Hence the\r\ncrowd below, my lord; yet they are nothing compared with the crowds that\r\ntoday are pressing their way from all D'Hartia and Kospia towards the\r\nMahovisal.”\r\n\r\n“All because of the Day?”\r\n\r\n“And to see YOU, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“All believers in the Jarados?”\r\n\r\n“All truly; but they do not all believe in your lordship. There are\r\nmany sects, including the Bars, that consider you an imposter; but the\r\nrest--perhaps the most--believe you the Herald of the Day. All want to\r\nsee you, for whatever motive.”\r\n\r\n“These Bars; who are they?”\r\n\r\n“The military priesthood, my lord. As priests they teach a literal\r\ninterpretation of the prophecy; as soldiers they maintain their own\r\naggrandisement. To be more specific, my lord, it is they who accuse you\r\nof being one of the false ones.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is written in the prophecy, my lord, that we may expect\r\nimpostors, and that we are to slay them.”\r\n\r\n“Then this coming contest with the Senestro--” beginning to sense the\r\ndrift of things.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord; it will be a physical contest, in which the best man\r\ndestroys the other!”\r\n\r\nThe guard was a tall, finely made and truly handsome chap of perhaps\r\nthirty-five. Watson liked the clear blue of his eyes and the openness\r\nof his manner. At the same time he felt that he was being weighed and\r\nbalanced.\r\n\r\n“My lord is not afraid?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! I was just thinking--when does this kill take place?”\r\n\r\n“Two days hence, my lord; on the first of the Sixteen Sacred Days.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus Chick found a staunch friend. The soldier's name, he learned,\r\nwas “the Jan Lucar.” He was supreme in command of the royal guards; and\r\nChick soon came to feel that the man would as cheerfully lay down his\r\nlife for him, Watson, as for the queen herself. All told, Chick was able\r\nto store away in his memory a few very important facts:\r\n\r\nFirst, that the Aradna did not like the Senestro.\r\n\r\nSecond, that the Jan Lucar hated the great Bar because of the prince's\r\nambition to wed the queen and her cousin, the Nervina; also because of\r\nhis selfish, autocratic ways.\r\n\r\nNext, that were the Nervina on hand she would thwart the Senestro; for\r\nshe was a very learned woman, as advanced as the Rhamda Avec himself.\r\nBut that she was a queen first and a scholar afterwards; her motive in\r\ngoing through the Blind Spot was to take care of the political welfare\r\nof her people, her purposes were as high as Rhamda Avec's, but partook\r\nof statesmanship rather than spirituality.\r\n\r\nFinally, that the Rhamdas were perfectly willing for the coming contest\r\nto take place, on the evening of the Day of the Prophet, in the Temple\r\nof the Bell and Leaf.\r\n\r\n“Jan Lucar,” Watson felt prompted to say, “you need have no fear as to\r\nthe outcome of the ordeal, whatever it may be. With your faith in me,\r\nI cannot fail. For the present, I need books, papers, scientific data.\r\nMoreover, I want to see the outside of this building.”\r\n\r\nThe guardsman bowed. “The data is possible, my lord, but as to leaving\r\nthe building--I must consult the queen and the Rhamda Geos first.”\r\n\r\n“But I said MUST” Watson dared to say. “I must go out into your world,\r\nsee your cities, your lands, rivers, mountains, before I do aught else.\r\nI must be sure!”\r\n\r\nThe other bowed again. He was visibly impressed.\r\n\r\n“What you ask, my lord, is full of danger. You must not be seen in\r\nthe streets--yet. Untold bloodshed would ensue inevitably. To half the\r\nThomahlians you are sacred, and to the other half an impostor. I repeat,\r\nmy lord, that I must see the Geos and the queen.”\r\n\r\nAnother bow and the Jan disappeared, to return in a few moments with the\r\nGeos.\r\n\r\n“The Jan has told me, my lord, that you would go out.”\r\n\r\n“If possible. I want to see your world.”\r\n\r\n“I think it can be arranged. Is your lordship ready to go?”\r\n\r\n“Presently.” Watson laid a hand on the big globe he had already puzzled\r\nover. “This represents the Thomahlia?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“How long is your day, Geos?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty-four hours.”\r\n\r\n“I mean, how many revolutions in one circuit of the sun, in one\r\nyear-circle?”\r\n\r\nAs he uttered the question Chick held his breath. It had suddenly struck\r\nhim that he had touched an extremely definite point. The answer might\r\nPLACE him!\r\n\r\n“You mean, my lord, how long is a circle in term of days?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred and sixty-five and a fraction, my lord.”\r\n\r\nWatson was dumbfounded. Could there be, in all the universe, another\r\nworld with precisely the same revolution period? But he could not afford\r\nto show his concern. He said:\r\n\r\n“Tell me, have you a moon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; it has a cycle of about twenty-eight days.”\r\n\r\nWatson drew a deep breath. Inconceivable though it appeared, he was\r\nstill on his own earth. For a moment he pondered, wondering if he had\r\nbeen caught up in tangle of time-displacement. Could it be that, instead\r\nof living in the present, he had somehow become entangled in the past or\r\nin the future?\r\n\r\nIf so--and by now he was so accustomed to the unusual that he considered\r\nthis staggering possibility with equanimity--if the time coefficient was\r\nat fault, then how to account for the picture of the professor, in that\r\nleaf? Had they both been the victims of a ghastly cosmic joke?\r\n\r\nThere was but one way to find out.\r\n\r\n“Come! Lead the way, Geos; let us take a look at your world!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nLOOKING DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently the three men were standing at the door of a vast room, one\r\nentire side of which was wide open to the outer air. It was filled by a\r\nnumber of queer, shining objects. At first glance Chick took them to be\r\nimmense beetles.\r\n\r\nThe Jan Lucar spoke to the Geos:\r\n\r\n“We had best take the June Bug of the Rhamda Avec.”\r\n\r\nWatson thought it best to say nothing, show nothing. The Jan ran up to\r\none of the glistening affairs, and without the slightest noise he spun\r\nit gracefully around, running it out into the centre of the mosaic\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“I presume,” apologised the Geos, “that you have much finer aircraft in\r\nyour world.”\r\n\r\nAircraft! Watson was all eagerness. He saw that the June Bug was about\r\nten feet high, with a bunchy, buglike body. On closer scrutiny he could\r\nmake out the outlines of wings folded tight against the sides. As for\r\nthe material, it must have been metal, to use a term which does not\r\nexplain very much, after all. In every respect the machine was a\r\nduplicate of some great insect, except that instead of legs it had\r\nwell-braced rollers.\r\n\r\n“How does it operate?” Watson wanted to know. “That is, what power do\r\nyou use, and how do you apply it?”\r\n\r\nThe Jan Lucar threw back a plate. Watson looked inside, and saw a mass\r\nof fine spider-web threads, softer than the tips of rabbit's hair, all\r\nradiating from a central grey object about the size of a pea. Chick\r\nreached out to touch this thing with his finger.\r\n\r\nBut the Geos, like a flash, caught him by the shoulder and pulled him\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, my lord!” he exclaimed. “But you must not touch it!\r\nYou--even you, would be annihilated!” Then to the Lucar: “Very well.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon the other did something in front of the craft; touched a\r\nlever, perhaps. Instantly the grey, spidery hairs turned to a dull red.\r\n\r\n“Now you may touch it,” said the Geos.\r\n\r\nBut Chick's desire had vanished. Instead he ventured a question:\r\n\r\n“All very interesting, but where is your machinery?”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda was slightly amused. He smiled a little. “You must give us a\r\nlittle credit, my lord. We must seem backward to you, but we have passed\r\nbeyond reliance upon simple machines. That little grey pellet is, of\r\ncourse, our motive force; it is a highly refined mineral, which we mine\r\nin vast quantity. It has been in use for centuries. As for the hair-like\r\nweb, that is our idea of a transmission.”\r\n\r\nWatson hoped that he did not look as uncomprehending as he felt. The\r\nother continued:\r\n\r\n“In aerial locomotion we are content to imitate life as much as\r\npossible. We long ago discarded engines and propellers, and instead\r\ntried to duplicate the muscular and nervous systems of the birds and\r\ninsects. We fly exactly as they do; our motive force is intrinsic. In\r\nsome respects, we have improved upon life.”\r\n\r\n“But it is still only a machine, Geos.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, my lord; only a machine. Anything without the life\r\nprinciple must remain so.”\r\n\r\nThe Jan Lucar pressed another catch, allowing another plate to lower\r\nand thereby disclose a glazed door, which opened into a cosy apartment\r\nfitted with wicker chairs, and large enough for four persons. There\r\nwas some sort of control gear, which the Jan Lucar explained was not\r\nconnected directly with the flying and steering members, but indirectly\r\nthrough the membranes of the web-like system. It was uncannily similar\r\nto the nervous connections of the cerebellum with the various parts of\r\nthe anatomy of an insect.\r\n\r\n“Does it travel very fast?”\r\n\r\n“We think so, my lord. This is the private machine of the Rhamda Avec.\r\nIt is rather small, but the swiftest machine in the Thomahlia.”\r\n\r\nThey entered the compartment, Watson took his seat beside the Geos,\r\nwhile the soldier sat forward next to the control elements. He laid\r\nhis hands on certain levers; next instant, the machine was gliding\r\nnoiselessly over the mosaic, on to a short incline and thence, with ever\r\nincreasing speed, toward and through the open side of the room.\r\n\r\nThe slides had all been thrown back; the compartment was enclosed only\r\nin glass. Watson could get a clear view, and he was amazed at the\r\nspeed of the craft. Before he could think they were out in mid-air and\r\nascending skyward. Travelling on a steep slant, there was no vibration,\r\nno mechanical noise; scarcely the suggestion of movement, except for the\r\nmuffled swish of the air.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the receding city below him, Chick could have imagined\r\nhimself sitting in a house while a windstorm tore by. He felt no change\r\nin temperature or any other ill effects; the cabin was fully enclosed,\r\nand heated by some invisible means. In short, ideal flight: for\r\ninstance, the seats were swung on gimbals, so that no matter at\r\nwhat angle the craft might fly, the passengers would maintain level\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nBelow stretched the Mahovisal--a mighty city of domes and plazas, and,\r\nwidely scattered, a few minarets. At the southern end there was a vast,\r\nsquare plaza, covering thousands of acres. Toward it, on two sides,\r\nconverged scores of streets; they stretched away from it like the ribs\r\nof a giant fan. On the remaining two sides there was a tremendously\r\nlarge building with a V-shaped front, opening on the square. The play\r\nof opal light on its many-bubbled roof resembled the glimmer from a vast\r\npearl.\r\n\r\nIn the air above the city an uncountable number of very small objects\r\ndarted hither and thither like sparkling fireflies. It was difficult to\r\nrealise that they, too, were aircraft.\r\n\r\nTo the west lay an immense expanse of silver, melting smoothly into the\r\nhorizon. Watson took it to be the Thomahlian ocean. Then he looked up at\r\nthe sky directly above him, and breathed a quick exclamation.\r\n\r\nIt was a single, small object, perfectly white, dropping out of the\r\namethyst. Tiny at first, amost instantly it assumed a proportion nearly\r\ncolossal--a great bird, white as the breast of the snowdrift, swooping\r\nwith the grace of the eagle and the speed of the wind. It was so very\r\nlarge that it seemed, to Chick, that if all the other birds he had\r\never known were gathered together into one they would still be as the\r\nswallow. Down, down it came in a tremendous spiral, until it gracefully\r\nalighted in a splash of molten colour on the bosom of the silver sea.\r\nFor a moment it was lost in a shower of water jewels--and then lay\r\nstill, a swan upon the ocean.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Geos?”\r\n\r\n“The Kospian Limited, my lord. One of our great airships--a fast one, we\r\nconsider it.”\r\n\r\n“It must accommodate a good many people, Rhamda.”\r\n\r\n“About nine thousand.”\r\n\r\n“You say it comes from Kospia. How far away is that?”\r\n\r\n“About six thousand miles. It is an eight-hour run, with one stop. Just\r\nnow the service is every fifteen minutes. They are coming, of course,\r\nfor the Day of the Prophet.”\r\n\r\nWatson continued to watch the great airship, noting the swarm of smaller\r\ncraft that came out from the Mahovisal to greet it, until the Jan Lucar\r\nsuddenly altered the course. They stopped climbing, and struck out on a\r\nhorizontal level. It left the Mahovisal behind them, a shimmering spot\r\nof fire beside the gleaming sea. They were travelling eastwards. The\r\nlandscape below was level and unvaried, of a greenish hue, and much\r\nlike that of Chick's own earth in the early spring-time--a vast expanse,\r\nlevel and sometimes dotted with opalescent towns and cities. Ribbons of\r\nsilver cut through the plain at intervals, crookedly lazy and winding,\r\nindicating a drainage from north to south or vice versa. Looking back to\r\nthe west, he could see the great, golden sun, poised as he had seen it\r\nthat morning, a huge amber plate on the rim of the world. It was sunset.\r\n\r\nThen Chick looked straight ahead. Far in the distance a great wall\r\nloomed skyward to a terrific height. So vast was it and so remote, at\r\nfirst it had escaped the eye altogether. An incredibly high range\r\nof mountains, glowing with a faint rose blush under the touch of the\r\nsetting sun. Against the sky were many peaks, each of them tipped with\r\ncurious and sparkling diamond-like corruscations. As Chick continued to\r\ngaze the rose began to purple.\r\n\r\nThe Jan Lucar put the craft to another upward climb. So high were they\r\nnow that the Thomahlia below was totally lost from view; it was but\r\na maze of lurking shadows. The sun was only a gash of amber--it was\r\ntwilight down on the ground. And Watson watched the black line of the\r\nThomahlian shadow climb the purple heights before him until only the\r\nhighest crests and the jewelled crags flashed in the sun's last rays.\r\nThen, one by one, they flickered out; and all was darkness.\r\n\r\nStill they ascended. Watson became uneasy, sitting there in the night.\r\n\r\n“Where are we going?”\r\n\r\n“To the Carbon Regions, my lord. It is one of the sights of the\r\nThomahlia.”\r\n\r\n“On top of those mountains?”\r\n\r\n“Beyond, my lord.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon, to Chick's growing amazement, the Geos went on to state that\r\ncarbon of all sorts was extremely common throughout their world. The\r\nsame forces that had formed coal so generously upon the earth had thrown\r\nup, almost as lavishly, huge quantities of pure diamond. The material\r\nwas of all colours, as diamonds run, and considered of small value; for\r\nevery day purposes they preferred substances of more sombre hues. They\r\nused it, it seemed, to build houses with.\r\n\r\n“But how do they cut it?”\r\n\r\n“Very easily. The material which drives this craft--Ilodium--will cut it\r\nlike butter.”\r\n\r\nLater, Watson understood. He watched as the craft continued to climb;\r\nthe Jan Lucar was steering without the aid of any outside lights\r\nwhatever, there being only a small light illuminating his instruments.\r\nChick presently turned his gaze outside again; whereupon he got another\r\njolt.\r\n\r\nHe saw a NEGATIVE sky!\r\n\r\nAt first he thought his eyes the victims of an illusion; then he looked\r\ncloser. And he saw that it was true; instead of the familiar starry\r\npoints of light against a velvet background, the arrangement was\r\njust the reverse. Every constellation was in its place, just as Chick\r\nremembered it from the earth; but instead of stars there were jet-black\r\nspots upon a faint, grey background.\r\n\r\nThe whole sky was one huge Milky Way, except for the black spots. And\r\nfrom it all there shone just about as much total light as from the\r\nheavens he had known.\r\n\r\nOf all he experienced, this was the most disturbing. It seemed totally\r\nagainst all reason; for he knew the stars to be great incandescent\r\nglobes in space. How explain that they were here represented in reverse,\r\ntheir brilliance scattered and diffused over the surrounding sky,\r\nleaving points of blackness instead? Afterward he learned that the\r\npeculiar chemical constituency of the atmosphere was solely responsible\r\nfor the inversion of the usual order of things.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden the Jan Lucar switched the craft to a level. He held up\r\none hand and pointed.\r\n\r\n“Look, my lord, and the Rhamda! Look!”\r\n\r\nBoth men rose from their seats, the better to stare past the soldier.\r\nStraight ahead, where had been one of the corruscating peaks, a streak\r\nof blue fire shot skyward, a column of light miles high, differing\r\nfrom the beams of a searchlight in that the rays were WAVY, serpentine,\r\ninstead of straight. It was weirdly beautiful. Geos caught his breath;\r\nhe leaned forward and touched the Jan Lucar.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” he said in an awed tone. “Wait a moment. It has never come\r\nbefore, but we can expect it now.” And even as he spoke, something\r\nwonderful happened.\r\n\r\nFrom the base of the column two other streaks, one red and the other\r\nbright green, cut out through the blackness on either side. The three\r\nstreams started from the same point; they made a sort of trident, red,\r\ngreen, and blue--twisting, alive--strangely impressive, suggestive of\r\ngrandeur and omnipotence--holy.\r\n\r\nAgain the Rhamda spoke. “Wait!” said he. “Wait!”\r\n\r\nThey were barely moving now. Watson watched and wondered. The three\r\nstreams of light ran up and up, as though they would pierce the heavens;\r\nthe eye could not follow their ends. All in utter silence, nothing but\r\nthose beams of glorified light, their reality a hint of power, of life\r\nand wisdom--of the certainty of things. Plainly it had a tremendous\r\nsignificance in the minds of the Geos and the Lucar.\r\n\r\nThen came the climax. Slowly, but somehow inexorably, like the laws of\r\nlife itself, and somewhere at a prodigious height above the earth, the\r\nthree outer ends of the red and the green and the blue spread out\r\nand flared back upon themselves and one another, until their combined\r\nbrilliance bridged a great rainbow across the sky. Blending into all\r\nthe colours of the prism, the bow became--for a moment--pregnant with\r\nan overpowering beauty, symbolical, portentous of something stupendous\r\nabout to come out of the unknown to the Thomahlians. And next--\r\n\r\nThe bow began to move, to swirl, and to change in shape and colour. The\r\nthree great rivers of light billowed and expanded and rounded into a new\r\nform. Then they burst--into a vast, three-leafed clover--blue and red\r\nand green!\r\n\r\nAnd Watson caught the startled words of the Geos:\r\n\r\n“The Sign of the Jarados!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE FROM THE VOID\r\n\r\n\r\nEven while that inexplicable heavenly pageant still burned against the\r\nheavens, something else took place, a thing of much greater importance\r\nto Chick. And, it happened right before his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the front of the car was a dial, slightly raised above the level of\r\nthe various controlling instruments. And all of a sudden this dial, a\r\nsmall affair about six inches across, broke into light and life.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a white blaze that covered the whole disc; then the\r\nwhiteness abruptly gave way to a flood of colour, which resolved itself\r\ninto a perfect miniature of the tri-coloured cloverleaf in the sky\r\nahead. Chick saw, however that the positions of the red and green were\r\njust the obverse of what glowed in the distance; and then he heard the\r\nvoice, strong and distinct, speaking with a slight metallic twang as\r\nfrom a microphone hidden in that little, blazing, coloured leaf:\r\n\r\n“Listen, ye who have ears to listen!”\r\n\r\nIt was said in the Thomahlian tongue. The Geos breathed:\r\n\r\n“The voice of the Prophet Jarados!”\r\n\r\nBut the next moment the unseen speaker began in another language--clear,\r\nsilver, musical--in English, and in a voice that Chick recognised!\r\n\r\n“Chick! You have done well, my boy. Your courage and your intuition may\r\nlead us out. Follow the prophecy to the letter, Chick; it MUST come\r\nto pass, exactly as it is written! Don't fail to read it, there on the\r\nwalls of the Temple of the Bell, when you encounter the Bar Senestro on\r\nthe Day of the Prophet!\r\n\r\n“I have discovered many things, my boy, but I am not omnipotent. Your\r\ncoming has made possible my last hope that I may return to my own kind,\r\nand take with me the secrets of life. You have done right to trust your\r\ninstinct; have no fear, yet remember that if you--if we--make one false\r\nstep we are lost.\r\n\r\n“Finally, if you should succeed in your contest with the Senestro, I\r\nshall send for you; but if you fail, I know how to die.\r\n\r\n“Return at once to the Mahovisal. Don't cross into the Region of Carbon.\r\nTake care how you go back; the Bars are waiting. But you can put full\r\nconfidence in the Rhamdas.”\r\n\r\nThen the speaker dropped the language of the earth and used the\r\nThomahlian tongue again: “It is I who speak--I, the Prophet; the Prophet\r\nJarados!”\r\n\r\nAll in the voice of Dr. Holcomb.\r\n\r\nThe blazing leaf faded into blackness, and the talking ceased. Chick was\r\nglad of the darkness; the whole thing was like magic, and too good\r\nto believe. The first actual words from the missing professor! Each\r\nsyllable was frozen into Watson's memory.\r\n\r\nThe Geos was clutching his arm.\r\n\r\n“Did you understand, my lord? We heard the voice of the prophet! What\r\ndid he say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand. He used his own language--my language. And he\r\nsaid”--taking the reins firmly into his hands--“he said that we must\r\nreturn to the Thomahlia. And we must beware of the Bars.”\r\n\r\nThere was no thought of questioning him. Without waiting the Geos'\r\ncommand, the Jan Lucar began putting the craft about. Watson glanced at\r\nthe sky; the great spectacle was gone; and he demanded of the soldier:\r\n\r\n“How can we get back? How do we find our way?”\r\n\r\nFor there was no visible light save the strange, fitful glow from\r\nthat uncanny sky to guide them; no lights from the inky carpet of the\r\nThomahlia, lights such as one would expect for the benefit of fliers.\r\nBut the soldier touched a button, and instantly another and larger dial\r\nwas illumined above the instruments.\r\n\r\nIt revealed a map or chart of a vast portion of the Thomahlia. On the\r\nfarther edge there appeared an area coloured to represent water, and\r\nadjoining this area was a square spot labeled “The Mahovisal.” And about\r\nmidway from this point to the near edge of the dial a red dot hung,\r\nmoving slowly over the chart.\r\n\r\n“The red dot, my lord, indicates our position,” explained the Jan. “In\r\nthat manner we know at all times where we are located, and which way we\r\nare flying. We shall arrive in the Mahovisal shortly.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the craft was gaining speed, and soon was travelling at\r\nan even greater rate than before. The red dot began to crawl at an\r\nastonishing speed. Of course, they had the benefit of the pull of\r\ngravity, now; apparently they would make the journey in a few minutes.\r\nBut incredible though the speed might be, there was nothing but the red\r\ndot to show it.\r\n\r\nThe Geos felt like talking. “My lord, the sign is conclusive. It is a\r\nmarvel, such as only the prophet could possibly have produced; with all\r\nour science we could not duplicate such splendour. Only once before has\r\nthe Thomahlia seen it.”\r\n\r\nAlready they were near enough to the surface to make out the clustered,\r\nblinking lights of the towns on the plain below. Ahead of them queer\r\nstreamers of pale rays thrust through the darkness. Watson recognised\r\nthem as the beams of the far-distant searchlights; and then and there\r\nhe gave thanks for one thing, at least, in which the Thomahlians had\r\nseemingly progressed no further than the people of the earth.\r\n\r\nComing a little nearer, Chick made out a number of bright, glittering,\r\ninsect-like objects, revealed by these searchlights. The Jan Lucar said:\r\n\r\n“The Bars, my lord. They are waiting; and they will head us off if they\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“The work of Senestro, I suppose. I thought he claimed to some honour.”\r\n\r\n“It is not the prince's work, my lord,” replied the soldier. “His\r\nD'Hartian and Kospian followers, some of them, have no scruples as to\r\nhow they might slay the 'false one', as they think you.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” hazarded Watson, “suppose I WERE the false one?”\r\n\r\nBoth the Geos and the Jan smiled. But the Rhamda's voice was very sure\r\nas he replied:\r\n\r\n“If you were false, my lord, I would slay you myself.”\r\n\r\nThey were very near the Mahovisal now. Below was the unmistakable\r\nopalescence, somehow produced by powerful illumination, as intense as\r\nsunlight itself. The red dot was almost above the black square on the\r\nlighted chart. And directly ahead, the air was becoming alive with the\r\nbeam-revealed aircraft. How could they get by in safety?\r\n\r\nBut Chick did not know the Jan Lucar. The soldier said:\r\n\r\n“My lord is not uneasy?”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” with unconcern. “Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because I propose something daring. I am free to admit, my lord, that\r\nwere the Geos and I alone, I should not attempt it. But not even the\r\nBars,” with magnificent confidence, “can stand before us now! We have\r\nhad the proof of the Jarados, and we know that no matter what the odds,\r\nhe will carry us through.”\r\n\r\n“What are you going to do?”\r\n\r\n“I propose to shoot it, my lord.” And without explaining the Jan asked\r\nthe Geos: “Are you agreeable? The June Bug will hold; the prophet will\r\nprotect us.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” returned the Rhamda. “There is nothing to fear, now, for those\r\nwho are in the company of the chosen.”\r\n\r\nWatson wondering watched the Jan as he tilted the nose of the June Bug\r\nand began to climb at an all but perpendicular angle straight into the\r\nheavens. Mile after mile, in less than as many minutes, they hurtled\r\ntowards the zenith, so that the lights of the city dimmed until only\r\nthe searching shafts could be seen. Chick began to guess what they\r\nwere going to do; that the Jan Lucar was nearly as reckless as he was\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nAt last the soldier brought the craft to a level. They soared along\r\nhorizontally for a while; the Jan kept his eye fixed on the red dot. And\r\nwhen it was directly above the black square he stated:\r\n\r\n“It is considered a perilous feat, my lord. We are going to drop. If we\r\nmake it from this height, not only will we break all records, but will\r\nhave proved the June Bug the superior in this respect, as she is in\r\nspeed. It is our only chance in any circumstances, but with the Jarados\r\nat our side, we need not fear that the craft will stand the strain. We\r\nshall go through them like stone; before they know it we shall be in the\r\ndrome--in less than a minute.”\r\n\r\n“From this height?” Chick concealed a shudder behind a fair show of\r\nscepticism. “A minute is not much time.”\r\n\r\n“Does my lord fear the drop?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I? I have in mind the June Bug; she might be set afire\r\nthrough friction, in dropping so quickly through the air.” Watson had a\r\nvivid picture of a blazing meteorite, containing the charred bodies of\r\nthree men, dropping out of--\r\n\r\n“My lord need not be concerned with that,” the Jan assured him. “The\r\nshell of the car is provided with a number of tiny pores, through\r\nwhich a heat-resisting fluid will be pumped during the manoeuvre. The\r\ntemperature may be raised a little, but no more.\r\n\r\n“You see this plug,” touching a hitherto unused knob among the\r\ninstruments. “By pulling that out, the mechanism of the craft is\r\nautomatically adjusted to care for every phase of the descent. Nothing\r\nelse remains to be done, after removing that plug, save to watch the red\r\ndot and prepare to step out upon the floor of our starting-place.”\r\n\r\n“Has the thing ever been done before?” Watson was sparring for time\r\nwhile he gathered his nerve.\r\n\r\n“I myself have seen it, my lord. The June Bug has been sent up many\r\ntimes, weighted with ballast; the plug was abstracted by clockwork; and\r\nin fifty-eight seconds she returned through the open end of the drone,\r\nwithout a hitch. It was beautiful. I have always envied her that plunge.\r\nAnd now I shall have the chance, with the hand of the Jarados as my\r\nguide and protector!”\r\n\r\nChick had just time to reflect that, if by any chance he got through\r\nwith this, he ought to be able to pass any test conceivable. He ought\r\nto be able to get away with anything. He started to murmur a prayer; but\r\nbefore he could finish, the Jan Lucar leaned over the dial-map for the\r\nlast time, saw that the red dot was now exactly central over the square\r\nthat represented the city, and unhesitatingly jerked out the plug.\r\n\r\nOf what happened next Watson remembered but little. The bottom seemed to\r\nhave dropped out of the universe. He was conscious of a crushing blur\r\nof immensity, of a silent thundering within him--then mental chaos and a\r\nstunned oblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nWHO IS THE JARADOS?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was all over. Chick opened his eyes to see the Jan throwing open the\r\nplate on the side of the compartment. Neither the soldier nor the Rhamda\r\nseemed to have noted Chick's daze. As for the Jan, his blue eyes were\r\ndancing with dare-devilry.\r\n\r\n“That's what I call living!” he grinned. “They can keep on looking for\r\nthe June Bug all night!”\r\n\r\nChick looked out. They were inside the great room from which they had\r\nstarted; the trip was over; the plunge had been made in safety. Chick\r\ntook a long breath, and held out a hand.\r\n\r\n“A man after my own heart, Jan Lucar. I foresee that we may have great\r\nsport with the Senestro.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, my lord,” cheerfully. “The presumptuous usurper! I only wish I\r\ncould kill him, instead of you.”\r\n\r\n“You are not the only one,” commented the Rhamda. “Half of the Rhamdas\r\nwould cheerfully act as the chosen one's proxy.”\r\n\r\nAnd so ended the events of Chick Watson's first day beyond the Blind\r\nSpot, his first day on the Thomahlia; that is, disregarding the previous\r\nmonths of unconsciousness. He had good reason to pass a sleepless night\r\nin legitimate worry for the outcome of it all; but instead he slept the\r\nsound sleep of exhaustion, awakening the next morning much refreshed.\r\n\r\nHe reminded himself, first of all, that today was the one immediately\r\npreceding that of his test--the Day of the Prophet. He had only a little\r\nmore than twenty-four hours to prepare. What was the best and wisest\r\nproceeding?\r\n\r\nHe called for the Geos. He told him what data he wanted. The Rhamda said\r\nthat he could find everything in a library in that building, and inside\r\na half-hour he returned with a pile of manuscripts.\r\n\r\nLeft to himself, Chick found that he now had data relating to all the\r\nsciences, to religion, to education and political history and the law.\r\nThe chronology of the Thomahlians, Chick found, dates back no less than\r\nfifteen thousand years. An abiding civilisation of that antiquity, it\r\nneed not be said, presented somewhat different aspects from what is\r\nknown on the earth.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the Jarados had come miraculously. That is, he had come\r\nout of the unknown, through a channel which he himself later termed the\r\nSpot of Life.\r\n\r\nHe had taught a religion of enlightenment, embracing intelligence,\r\nlove, virtue, and the higher ethics such as are inherent in all great\r\nphilosophies. But he did not call himself a religionist. That was the\r\nqueer point. He said that he had come to teach an advanced philosophy of\r\nlife; and he expressly stated that his teachings were absolute only to a\r\nlimited extent.\r\n\r\n“Man must seek and find,” was one of his epigrams; “and if he find no\r\nmore truths, then he will find lies.” Which was merely a negative way of\r\nsaying that some of his philosophy was only provisional.\r\n\r\nBut on some points he was adamant. He had arrived at a time when the\r\nunthinking, self-glorifying Thomahlians had all but exterminated the\r\nlower orders of creation. The Jarados sought to remove the handicap\r\nwhich the people had set upon themselves, and gave them, in the place\r\nof kindness which they had forgotten, how to use, a burning desire for\r\na positive knowledge, where before had been only blind faith. Also, he\r\ntaught good-fellowship, as a means to this end. He taught beauty, love,\r\nand laughter, the three great cleansers of humanity. And yet, through it\r\nall--\r\n\r\nThe Jarados was a mystic.\r\n\r\nHe studied life after a manner of his own. He was a stickler for getting\r\ndown to the very heart of things, for prodding around among causes until\r\nhe found the cause itself. And thus he learned the secret of the occult.\r\n\r\nFor so he taught. And presently the Jarados was recognized as an\r\nauthority on what the Thomahlia called “the next world.” Only he showed\r\nthat death, instead of being an ushering into a void, was merely a\r\ntranslation onto another plane of life, a higher plane and a more\r\nglorious one. In short, a thing to be desired and attained, not to be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThis put the Spot of Life on an entirely different basis. No longer\r\nwas it a fearsome thing. The Jarados elevated death to the plane of\r\nmotherhood--something to glory in. And Chick gathered that his famous\r\nprophecy--which he had yet to read, where it hung on the wall of the\r\ntemple--gave every detail of the Jarados' profound convictions and\r\nteachings regarding the mystery of the next life.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes a curious thing. As Chick read these details, he became\r\nmore and more conscious of--what shall it be called?--the presence of\r\nsomeone or something beside him, above and all about him, watching his\r\nevery movement. He could not get away from the feeling, although it was\r\nbroad daylight, and he was seemingly quite alone in the room. Chick was\r\nnot frightened; but he could have sworn that a very real personality was\r\nenveloping his own as he read.\r\n\r\nEvery word, somehow, reminded him of the miraculous sequence of facts\r\nas he knew them; the unerring accuracy with which he, quite unthinkingly\r\nand almost without volition, had solved problem after problem, although\r\nthe chances were totally against him. He became more and more convinced\r\nthat he himself had practically no control over his affairs; that he\r\nwas in the hands of an irresistible Fate; and that--he could not help\r\nit--his good angel was none other than the prophet who, almost ninety\r\ncenturies ago, had lived and taught upon the Thomahlia, and in the end\r\nhad returned to the unknown.\r\n\r\nBut how could such a thing be? Watson did not even know where he was!\r\nSmall wonder that, again and again, he felt the need of assurance. He\r\nasked for the Jan Lucar.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” began Chick without preamble, “you accept me, Jan\r\nLucar; do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“You conceive me to be out of the spiritual world, and yet flesh and\r\nblood like yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” with flat conviction.\r\n\r\nThat settled it. Watson decided to find out something he had not had\r\ntime to locate in the library.\r\n\r\n“The Rhamda may have told you, Jan Lucar, that I am here to seek the\r\nJarados. Now, I suspect the Senestro. Can you imagine what he has done\r\nto the prophet?”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” remonstrated the other, “daring as the Bar might be, he could\r\ndo nothing to the Jarados. He would not dare.”\r\n\r\n“Then he is afraid to run counter to the prophecy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord; that is, its literal interpretation. He is opposed only\r\nto the broader version as held by such liberals as the Rhamda Avec. The\r\nBars are always warning the people against the false one.”\r\n\r\n“And the Senestro is at their head,” mused Chick aloud. “This brother of\r\nhis who died--usually there are two such princes and chiefs?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“And the Senestro plans to marry both queens, according to the custom!”\r\n\r\n“My lord”--and the Jan suddenly snapped erect--“the Bar will do\r\nexceedingly well if he succeeds in marrying one of them! Certainly he\r\nshall never have the Aradna--not while I live and can fight!”\r\n\r\n“Good! How about the Nervina?”\r\n\r\n“He'll do well to find her first!”\r\n\r\n“True enough. What would you say was his code of honour?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, the Senestro actually has no code. He believes in nothing. He\r\nis so constituted, mentally and morally, that he cares for and trusts in\r\nnone but himself. He is a sceptic pure and simple; he cares nothing for\r\nthe Jarados and his teachings. He is an opportunist seeking for power,\r\nwicked, lustful, cruel--”\r\n\r\n“But a good sportsman!”\r\n\r\n“In what way, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Didn't he allow me the choice of combat?”\r\n\r\nThe Jan laughed, but his handsome face could not hide his contempt.\r\n\r\n“It is ever so with a champion, my lord. He has never been defeated in\r\na matter of physical prowess. It would be far more to his glory to\r\novercome you in combat of your own selection. It will be spectacular--he\r\nknows the value of dramatic climax--and he would kill you in a moment,\r\nbefore a million Thomahlians.”\r\n\r\n“It's a nice way to die,” said Watson. “You must grant that much.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know of any nice way to die, my lord. But it is a good way of\r\nliving--to kill the Bar Senestro. I would that I could have the honour.”\r\n\r\n“How does it come that the Rhamdas, superintellectual as they are,\r\ncan consent to such a contest? Is it not degrading, to their way of\r\nthinking? It smacks of barbarism.”\r\n\r\n“They do not look upon it in that light, my lord. Our civilisation has\r\npassed beyond snobbery. Of course there was a time, centuries ago when\r\nwe were taught that any physical contest was brutal. But that was before\r\nwe knew better.”\r\n\r\n“You don't believe it now?”\r\n\r\n“By no means, my lord. The most wonderful physical thing in the\r\nThomahlia is the human body. We do not hide it. We admire beauty,\r\nstrength, prowess. The live body is above all art; it is the work of God\r\nhimself; art is but an imitation. And there is nothing so splendid as\r\na physical contest--the lightning correlation of mind and body. It is a\r\npicture of life.”\r\n\r\n“Do the Rhamdas think this?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly. A Rhamda is always first an athlete.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Perfection, my lord. A perfect mind does not always dwell in a perfect\r\nbody, but they strive for it as much as possible. The first test of a\r\nRhamda is his body. After he passes that he must take the mental test.”\r\n\r\n“Mental?”\r\n\r\n“Moral first. The most rigid, perhaps of all; he must be a man above\r\nsuspicion. The honour of a Rhamda must never be questioned. He must\r\nbe upright and absolutely unselfish. He must be broad-minded,\r\nhuman, lovable, and a leader of men. After that, my lord, comes the\r\nintellectual test.”\r\n\r\n“He must be a learned man?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, your lordship. There are many very learned men who could\r\nnot be Rhamdas; and there are many who have had no learning at all\r\nwho eventually were admitted. The qualifications are intellectual,\r\nnot educational; the mind is put to a rigid test. It is examined for\r\nalertness, perception, memory, reason, emotion, and control. There is no\r\ngreater honour in all the Thomahlia.”\r\n\r\n“And they are all athletes?”\r\n\r\n“Every one, my lord. In all the world there is no finer body of men, I\r\nmyself would hesitate before entering a match with even the old Rhamda\r\nGeos.”\r\n\r\n“How about the Rhamda Avec?”\r\n\r\n“Nor he, either; in the gymnasium he was always the superior, just as he\r\ntopped all others morally and mentally.”\r\n\r\nDid this explain the Avec's physical prowess, on the one hand, and the\r\nfact that he would not stoop to take that ring by force, on the other?\r\n\r\n“Just one more thing, Jan Lucar. You have absolutely no fear that I may\r\nfail tomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Not the slightest, my lord. You cannot fail!”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I have already said--because you are from the Jarados.”\r\n\r\nAnd Chick, facing the greatest experience of his life, submerged in a\r\nsea wherein only a few islands of fact were visible, had to be content\r\nwith this: his only friends were those who were firmly convinced of\r\nsomething which, he knew only too well, was a flat fraud! All this\r\nbacking was based upon a misled faith.\r\n\r\nNo, not quite. Was there not that strange feeling that the Jarados\r\nhimself was at his back? And had he not found that the prophet had\r\nbeen real? Did he not feel, as positively as he felt anything, that the\r\nJarados was still a reality?\r\n\r\nChick went to bed that night with a light heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF THE BELL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was hard for Chick to remember all the details of that great day.\r\nThroughout all the morning and afternoon he remained in his apartments.\r\nBreakfast over, the Rhamdas told him his part in certain ceremonies,\r\nsuch as need not be detailed here. They were very solicitous as to\r\nhis food and comfort, and as to his feelings and anticipations. His\r\nnonchalance pleased them greatly. Afterward he had a bath and rub-down.\r\n\r\nA combat to the death, was it to be? Suits me, thought Watson. He was\r\nnever in finer form.\r\n\r\nThe Jan Lucar was particularly interested. He pinched and stroked\r\nChick's muscles with the caressing pride of a connoisseur. Watson\r\nstepped out of the fountain bath in all the vigour of health. He\r\nplayfully reached out for the Lucar and tripped him up. He sought to\r\nlearn just what the Thomahlians knew in the art of self-defence.\r\n\r\nThe brief struggle that ensued taught him that he need expect no easy\r\nconquest. The Jan was quick, active and the possessor of a science\r\npeculiarly effective. The Thomahlians did not box in the manner of the\r\nAnglo-Saxons; their mode was peculiar. Chick foresaw that he would\r\nbe compelled to combine the methods of three kinds of combat: boxing,\r\nju-jitsu, and the good old catch-as-catch-can wrestling. If the Senestro\r\nwere superior to the Jan, he would have a time indeed. Though Watson\r\nconquered, he could not but concede that the Jan was not only clever but\r\nscientific to an oily, bewildering degree. The Lucar paused.\r\n\r\n“Enough, my lord! You are a man indeed. Do not overdo; save yourself for\r\nthe Senestro.”\r\n\r\nClothes were brought, and Chick taken back to his apartment. The time\r\npassed with Rhamdas constantly at his side.\r\n\r\nThe Geos was not present, nor the little queen. Chick sought permission\r\nto sit by the window--permission that was granted after the guards had\r\nplaced screens that would withhold any view from outside, yet permit\r\nChick to look out.\r\n\r\nAs far as he could see, the avenues were packed with people. Only, this\r\ntime the centres of the streets were clear; on the curbs he could see\r\nthe opposing lines of the blue and crimson, holding back the waiting\r\nthousands. In the distance he could hear chimes, faint but distinct,\r\nlike silver bells tinkling over water.\r\n\r\nAt intervals rose strange choruses of weird, holy music. The full sweep\r\nof the city's domes and minarets was spread out before him. From eaves\r\nto basements the rolling luxuriance of orchidian beauty; banners, music,\r\nparade; a day of pageant, pomp, and fulfilment.\r\n\r\nHe could catch the excitement in the air, the strange, laden\r\nundercurrent of spiritual salvation-something esoteric, undefinable, the\r\necstasy of a million souls pulsing to the throb of a supreme moment. He\r\ndrew back, someone had touched him.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\nIt was one of the Rhamdas. He had in his hand a small metal clover, of\r\nthe design of the Jarados.\r\n\r\n“What do I do?” asked Watson.\r\n\r\n“This,” said the Rhamda, “was sent to you by one of the Bars.”\r\n\r\n“By a Bar! What does it mean?”\r\n\r\nThe other shook his head. “It was sent to you by one who wished it to be\r\nknown by us that he is your friend, even though a Bar.”\r\n\r\nJust then Watson noted something sticking out of the edge of one of the\r\nclover leaves. He pulled it out. It was a piece of paper. On it were\r\nscrawled words IN ENGLISH.\r\n\r\nThe writing was pencil script, done in a poor hand and ill-spelled, but\r\nstill English. Chick read:\r\n\r\n“Be of good cheer; there ain't a one in this world that can top a lad\r\nfrom Frisco. And it's Pat MacPherson that says it. Yer the finest laddie\r\nthat ever got beyond the old Witch of Endor. You and me, if we hold on,\r\nis just about goin' to play hell with the haythen. Hold on and fight\r\nlike the divil! Remember that Pat is with ye!\r\n\r\n“We're both spooks.\r\n\r\n“PAT MACPHERSON”\r\n\r\nSaid Watson: “Who gave you this? Did you see the man?”\r\n\r\n“It was sent up my lord. The man was a high Bar in the Senestro's\r\nguard.”\r\n\r\nWatson could not understand this. Was it possible that there were others\r\nin this mysterious region besides himself? At any rate, he wasn't wholly\r\nalone. He felt that he could count upon the Irishman--or was this\r\nfellow Scotch? Anyhow, such a man would find the quick means of wit at a\r\ncrucial moment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Watson noted a queer feeling of emptiness. He looked out of the\r\nwindow. The music had ceased, and the incessant hum of the throngs had\r\ndeadened to silence. It was suspended, awesome, threatening. At the same\r\ntime, the Jan Lucar came to attention, at the opposite door stood the\r\nRhamda Geos, black clad, surrounded by a group of his fellows.\r\n\r\n“Come, my lord,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe crimson guard fell in behind Watson, the black-gowned took their\r\nplaces ahead, and the Jan Lucar and the Geos walked on either side. They\r\nstepped out into the corridor. By the indicator of a vertical clock,\r\nChick noted that it was nine. He did not know the day of the year other\r\nthan from the Thomahlian calendar; but he knew that it was close to\r\nsunset. He did not ask where they were going; there was no need. The\r\nvery solemnity of his companions told him more than their answers would\r\nhave. In a moment they were in the streets.\r\n\r\nWatson had thought that they would be taken by aircraft, or that\r\nthey would pass through the building. He did not know that it was a\r\nconcession to the Bar Senestro; that the Senestro was but playing a bit\r\nof psychology that is often practised by lesser champions. If Watson's\r\nnerve was not broken it was simply because of the iron indifference of\r\nconfident health. Chick had never been defeated. He had no fear. He was\r\nfar more curious as to the scenes and events about him than he was of\r\nthe outcome. He was hoping for some incident that would link itself up\r\ninto explanation.\r\n\r\nAt the door a curious car of graceful lines was waiting, an odd affair\r\nthat might be classed as a cross between a bird and a gondola, streaming\r\nwith colours and of magnificent workmanship and design. On the deck of\r\nthis the three men took their places; on the one side the Rhamda Geos,\r\ntall, sombre, immaculate; on the other, the magnificent Jan Lucar in the\r\ngorgeous crimson uniform, gold-braided and studded with jewels; on his\r\nhead he wore the shako of purple down, and by his side a peculiar black\r\nweapon which he wore much in the manner of a sword.\r\n\r\nIn the centre, Watson--bareheaded, his torso bare and his arms naked.\r\nHe had been given a pair of soft sandals, and a short suit, whose one\r\nredeeming feature in his eyes was a pocket into which he had thrust the\r\nautomatic that he valued so much. It was more like a picture of Rome\r\nthan anything else. Whatever the civilisation of the Thomahlians, their\r\nritual in Watson's eyes smacked still of barbarism.\r\n\r\nBut he was intensely interested in all about him. The avenues were\r\nlarge. On either side the guards were drawn up eight deep, holding back\r\nthe multitude that pressed and jostled with the insistence of curiosity.\r\nHe looked into the myriad faces; about him, splendid features, of\r\nintelligent man and women.\r\n\r\nNot one face suggested the hideous; the women were especially beautiful,\r\nand, from what he could see, finely formed and graceful. Many of them\r\nsmiled; he could hear the curious buzz of conjecturing whispers. Some\r\nwere indifferent, while others, from the expression of their faces, were\r\nopenly hostile.\r\n\r\nChick was in the middle of a procession, the Rhamdas marching before and\r\nthe crimson guard bringing up the rear. A special guard: the inner one,\r\nRhamdas, the outer one of crimson surrounding them all.\r\n\r\nThe car started. There was no trace of friction; it was noiseless,\r\nautomatic. Chick could only conjecture as to its mechanism. The black\r\ncolumn of Rhamdas moved ahead rhythmically, with the swing of solemn\r\ngrandeur. For some minutes they marched through the streets of the\r\nMahovisal. There was no cheering; it was a holy, awesome occasion. Chick\r\ncould sense the undercurrent of the staring thousands, the reverence\r\nand the piety. It was the Day of the Prophet. They were staring at a\r\nmiracle.\r\n\r\nThe column turned a corner. For the first time Watson was staggered by\r\nsheer immensity; for the first time he felt what it might be to see with\r\nthe eyes of an insect. Had he been an ant looking up at the columns\r\nof Karnak, he would still have been out of proportion. It was immense,\r\ncolossal, beyond man. It was of the omnipotent--the pillared portal of\r\nthe Temple of the Bell.\r\n\r\nSuch a building a genius might dream of, in a moment of unhampered,\r\ninspired imagination. It was stupendous. The pillars were hexagonal\r\nin shape, and in diameter each of about the size of an ordinary house.\r\nDropping from an immense height, it seemed as if they had originally\r\npoured out in the form of molten metal from immense bell-like flares\r\nthat fell from the vaulted architrave. Such was the design.\r\n\r\nChick got the impression that the top of the structure, somehow, was\r\nnot supported by the foundation, but rather the reverse--the floor was\r\nsuspended from the ceiling. It was the work of the Titans--so high\r\nand stupendous that at the first instant Watson felt numb with\r\ninsignificance. What chance had he against men of such colossal\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nHow large the building was he could not see. The Gargantuan facade\r\nitself was enough to smother comprehension. It was laid out in the\r\nform of a triangle, one end of which was open towards the city; the\r\ntwo sections of the facade met under a huge, arched opening--the door\r\nitself. Watson recognised the structure as the one he had seen from\r\nthe June Bug on the outskirts of the Mahovisal. The enormous plaza was\r\npacked with people, leaving only a narrow lane for the procession; and\r\nas far back as Chick could see crowds in the streets converged towards\r\nthis vast space. Their numbers were incalculable.\r\n\r\nThe car stopped. The guards, both crimson and blue, formed a twenty-fold\r\ncordon. Watson could feel the suspended breath of the waiting multitude.\r\nThe three men stepped out--the Geos first, then the Jan Lucar, and\r\nWatson last. Chick caught the Lucar's eye; it was confident; the man was\r\nspringing with vigour, jovial in spite of the moment.\r\n\r\nThey passed between two of the huge pillars, and under the giant arch.\r\nFor a few minutes they walked through what seemed, to Chick, a perfect\r\nmaze of those titanic columns. And every foot was marked by the lines of\r\ncrimson and blue, flanking either side.\r\n\r\nAn immense sea of people rose high into the forest of pillars as far as\r\nhis eye could reach. He had never been in such a concourse of humanity.\r\n\r\nThey passed through an inner arch, a smaller and lower one, into what\r\nChick guessed was the temple proper. And if Chick had thought the\r\nanteroom stupendous, he saw that a new word, one which went beyond all\r\nprevious experience, was needed to describe what he now saw.\r\n\r\nIt was almost too immense to be grasped in its entirety. Gone was the\r\nmaze of columns; instead, far, far away to the right and to the left,\r\nstood single rows of herculean pillars. There were but seven on a side,\r\nseparated by great distances; and between them stretched a space so\r\nimmense, so incredibly vast, that a small city could have been housed\r\nwithin it. And over it all was not the open sky, but a ceiling of such\r\nterrific grandeur that Chick almost halted the procession while he\r\ngazed.\r\n\r\nFor that ceiling was the under side of a cloud, a grey-black, forbidding\r\nthundercloud. And the fourteen pillars, seven on either side, were\r\nprodigious waterspouts, monster spirals of the hue of storm, with\r\nflaring sweeps at top and bottom that welded roof and floor into one\r\nterrific whole. Sheer from side to side stretched that portentous level\r\ncloud; it was a span of an epoch; and on either side it was rooted in\r\nthose awful columns, seemingly alive, as though ready at any instant to\r\nsuck up the earth into the infinite.\r\n\r\nBy downright will-power Watson tore his attention away and directed it\r\nupon the other features of that unprecedented interior. It was lighted,\r\napparently, by great windows behind the fourteen pillars; windows\r\ntoo far to be distinguishable. And the light revealed, directly ahead\r\nsomething that Chick at first thought to be a cascade of black water.\r\nIt leaped out of the rear wall of the temple, and at its crest it\r\nwas bordered with walls of solid silver, cut across and designed with\r\nscrolls of gold and gem work; walls that swooped down and ended with two\r\nhuge green columns at the base of that fantastic fall.\r\n\r\nAs they approached a swarm of tiny bronze objects, silver winged,\r\nfluttered out through the temple--tiny birds, smaller than swallows,\r\nbeautiful and swift-winged, elusive. They were without number; in a\r\nmoment the air of the temple was alive with flitting, darting spots of\r\nglinting colour.\r\n\r\nThen Chick saw that there were two people sitting high on the crest\r\nof that cascade. Wondering, Chick and the rest marched on through the\r\nsilent crowd; all standing with bared heads and bated breaths. The\r\nworshipping Thomahlians filled every inch of that enormous place. Only\r\na narrow lane permitted the procession to pass towards that puzzling,\r\nsilent, black waterfall.\r\n\r\nThey were almost at its base when Chick saw the vanguard of the Rhamdas\r\nunhesitatingly stride straight against the torrent, and then mount upon\r\nit. Up they marched; and Chick knew that the black water was black jade,\r\nand that the two people at its crest were seated upon a landing at the\r\ntop of the grandest stairway he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nUp went the Rhamdas deploying to right and left against the silver\r\nwalls. The crimson and blue uniformed guards remained behind, lining\r\nthe lane through the throng. At the foot of the steps Chick stopped and\r\nlooked around, and again he felt numb at the sheer vastness of it all.\r\n\r\nFor he was looking back now at the portal through which the procession\r\nhad marched; a portal now closed; and above it, covering a great expanse\r\nof that wall and extending up almost into the brooding cloud above, was\r\nspread a mighty replica of the tri-coloured Sign of the Jarados.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Chick felt the full significance of symbolism.\r\nWhereas before it had been but an incident of adventure, now it was the\r\nsymbol of mystic revelation. It was not only the motif for all other\r\ndecoration upon the walls and minor elements of the temple; it was the\r\nemblem of the trinity, deep, holy, significant of the mystery of\r\nthe universe and the hereafter. There was something deeper than mere\r\nfatalism; behind all was the fact-rooted faith of a civilisation.\r\n\r\nBut at that moment, as Chick paused with one foot on the bottom step of\r\nthe flight, something happened that sent quivers of joy and confidence\r\nall through him. Someone was talking--talking in English!\r\n\r\nChick looked. The speaker was a man in the blue garb of the Senestro's\r\nguard. He was standing at the end of the line nearest the stair, and\r\nslightly in front of his fellows. Like the rest, he was holding his\r\nweapon, a black, needled-pointed sword, at the salute. Chick gave him\r\nonly a glance, then had the presence of mind to look elsewhere as a man\r\nsaid, in a low, guarded voice:\r\n\r\n“Y' air right, me lad; don't look at me. I know what ye're thinkin'. But\r\nshe ain't as bad as she looks! Keep yer heart clear; never fear. You an'\r\nme can lick all Thomahlia! Go straight up them stairs, an' stand that\r\nblackguard Senestro on his 'ead, just like y'd do in Frisco!”\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Watson, intent upon the great three-leafed clover.\r\nHe used the same low, cautious tone the other had employed. “Who are\r\nyou, friend?”\r\n\r\n“Pat MacPherson, of course,” was the answer. “An' Oi've said a plenty.\r\nNow, go aboot your business.”\r\n\r\nWatson did not quibble. There was no time to learn more. He did not wish\r\nit to be noticed; yet he could not hide it from the Jan Lucar and the\r\nRhamda Geos, who were still at his side. They had heard that tongue\r\nbefore. The looks they exchanged told, however, that they were gratified\r\nrather than displeased by the interruption. Certainly all feelings of\r\ndepression left Chick, and he ascended the stairs with a glad heart and\r\na resilient stride that could not but be noticed.\r\n\r\nHe was ready for the Senestro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nTHE PROPHECY\r\n\r\n\r\nReaching the top of the jade steps, Chick found the landing to be a\r\ngreat dais, nearly a hundred feet across. On the right and left this\r\ndais was hedged in by the silver walls, on each of which was hung a\r\nhuge, golden scrollwork. These scrolls bore legends, which for the\r\nmoment Chick ignored. At the rear of the dais was a large object like a\r\nbronze bell.\r\n\r\nThe floor was of the usual mosaic, except in the centre, where there\r\nwas a plain, circular design. Chick took careful note of this, a circle\r\nabout twenty feet across, as white and unbroken as a bed of frozen snow.\r\nWhether it was stone or not he could not determine. All around its edge\r\nwas a gap that separated it from the dais, a gap several inches across.\r\nChick turned to Geos:\r\n\r\n“The Spot of Life?”\r\n\r\n“Even so. It is the strangest thing in all the Thomahlia, my lord. Can\r\nyou feel it?”\r\n\r\nFor Watson had reached out with his toe and touched the white surface.\r\nHe drew it back suddenly.\r\n\r\n“It has a feeling,” he replied, “that I cannot describe. It is cold, and\r\nyet it is not. Perhaps it is my own magnetism.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! It is well, my lord!”\r\n\r\nWhat the Rhamda meant by that Chick could not tell. He was interested\r\nin the odd white substance. It was as smooth as glass, although at\r\nintervals there were faint, almost imperceptible, dark lines, like the\r\nfinest scratches in old ivory. Yet the whiteness was not dazzling. Again\r\nWatson touched it with his foot, and noted the inexplicable feeling of\r\nexhilaration. In the moment of absorption he quite forgot the concourse\r\nabout him. He knew that he was now standing on the crux of the Blind\r\nSpot.\r\n\r\nBut in a minute he turned. The dais was a sort of nave, with one end\r\nopen to the stairway. Seated on his left was the frail Aradna, occupying\r\na small throne-like chair of some translucent green material. On the\r\nright sat the Bar Senestro, in a chair differing only in that its colour\r\nwas a bright blue. In the centre of the dais stood a third chair--a\r\ncrimson one--empty.\r\n\r\nThe Senestro stood up. He was royally clad, his breast gleaming with\r\njewels. He was certainly handsome; he had the carriage of confident\r\nroyalty. There was no fear in this man, no uncertainty, no weakness.\r\nIf confidence were a thing of strength, the Senestro was already the\r\nvictor. In his heart Chick secretly admired him.\r\n\r\nBut just then the Aradna stood up, She made an indication to Watson. He\r\nstepped over to the queen. She sat down again.\r\n\r\n“I want to give you my benediction, stranger lord. Are you sure of\r\nyourself? Can you overcome the Senestro?”\r\n\r\n“I am certain,” spoke Watson. “It is for the queen, O Aradna. I know\r\nnothing of the prophecy; but I will fight for you!”\r\n\r\nShe blushed and cast a furtive look in the direction of the Senestro.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” she spoke. “The outcome will have a double\r\ninterpretation--the spiritual one of the prophecy, and the earthly,\r\nmaterial one that concerns myself. If you conquer, my lord, I am freed.\r\nI would not marry the Senestro; I love him not. I would abide by the\r\nprophet, and await the chosen.” She hesitated. “What do you know of the\r\nchosen, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, O Aradna.”\r\n\r\n“Has not the Rhamda Geos told you?”\r\n\r\n“Partly, but not fully. There is something that he is withholding.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely. And now--will you kneel, my lord?”\r\n\r\nWatson knelt. The queen held out her hand. Behind him Chick could hear\r\na deep murmur from the assembled multitudes. Just what was the\r\nsignificance of that sound he did not know; nor did he care. It was\r\nenough for him that he was to fight for this delicately beautiful\r\nmaiden. He would let the prophecy take care of itself.\r\n\r\nBesides these three on the dais there were only the Rhamda Geos and\r\nthe Jan Lucar. These two remained on the edge nearest the body of the\r\ntemple, the edge at the crest of the stair. The empty chair remained so.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Chick remembered the warning of Dr. Holcomb: “Read the words of\r\nthe Prophet.” And he took advantage of the breathing-spell to peruse the\r\nlegends on the great golden scrolls:\r\n\r\nTHE PROPHECY OF THE JARADOS\r\n\r\nBehold! When the day is at hand, prepare ye!\r\n\r\nFor, when that day cometh, ye shall have signs and portents from the\r\nworld beyond. Wisdom cometh out of life, and life walketh out of wisdom.\r\nYea, in the manner of life and of spirit ye shall have them, and of\r\nsubstance even like unto you yourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that we shall be on guard.\r\nBy these signs ye shall know them; even by the truths I have taught\r\nthee. The way of life is an open door; wisdom and virtue are its keys.\r\nAnd when the intelligence shall be lifted to the plane above--then shalt\r\nthou know!\r\n\r\nMark ye well the Spot of Life! He that openeth it is the precursor of\r\njudgment. Mark him well!\r\n\r\nAnd thus shall the last days come to pass. See that ye are worthy, O\r\nwise ones! For behold in those last days there shall come among ye--\r\n\r\nThe chosen of a line of kings. First there shall be one, and then there\r\nshall be two; and the two shall stay but the one shall return.\r\n\r\nThe false ones. Them ye shall slay!\r\n\r\nThe four footed: The call to humility, sacrifice and devotion, whom ye\r\nshall hold in reverence even as you hold me, the Jarados.\r\n\r\nAnd on the last day of all--I, the Jarados!\r\n\r\nBeware ye of sacrilege! Lest I take from ye all that I have given ye,\r\nand the day be postponed--beware ye of sacrilege!\r\n\r\nAnd if the false ones cometh not, ye shall know that I have held them.\r\nKnow ye the day!\r\n\r\nSixteen days from the day of the prophet, shall come the day of the\r\njudgment; and the way shall be opened, on the last day, the sixteenth\r\nday of the Jarados.\r\n\r\nHearken to the words of the Jarados, the prophet and mouthpiece of\r\nthe infinite intelligence, ruler of justice, peace, and love! So be it\r\nforever!\r\n\r\nChick read it a second time. Like all prophecies, it was somewhat\r\nDelphic; but he could get the general drift. In that golden script he\r\nwas looking into the heart of all Thomahlia--into its greatness, its\r\nculture, its civilisation itself. It was the soul of the Blind Spot, the\r\nreason and the wherefore of all about him.\r\n\r\nHe heard someone step up behind him, and he turned. It was the Senestro,\r\ngoing over the words of the prophecy.\r\n\r\n“Can you read it, Sir Phantom?” asked the handsome Bar. His black eyes\r\nwere twinkling with delight. “Have you read it all?”\r\n\r\nHe put a hand on Chick's shoulder. It was a careless act, almost\r\nfriendly. Either he had the heart of a devil or the chivalry of a\r\npaladin. He pointed to a line:\r\n\r\n“'The false ones. Them ye shall slay.'”\r\n\r\n“And if I were the false one, you would slay me?” asked Watson.\r\n\r\n“Aye, truly!” answered the splendid prince. “You are well made and\r\ngood to look upon. I shall hold you in my arms; I shall hear your bones\r\ncrack; it shall be sweeter music than that of the temple pheasants,\r\nwho never sing but for the Jarados. I shall slay you upon the Spot, Sir\r\nPhantom!”\r\n\r\nWatson turned on his heel. The ethics of the Senestro were not of his\r\nown code. He was not afraid; he stood beside the Jan Lucar and gazed out\r\ninto the body of the temple. As far as he could see, under and past the\r\nfourteen great pillars and right up to the far wall, the floor was a\r\nvast carpet of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt was become dark. Presently a new kind of light began to glow far\r\noverhead, gradually increasing in strength until the whole place was\r\nsuffused with a sun-like illumination. The Rhamda Geos began to speak.\r\n\r\n“In the last day, in the Day of Life. We have the substance of\r\nourselves, and the words of the prophet. The Jarados has written his\r\nprophecy in letters of gold, for all to see. 'The false ones. Them ye\r\nshall slay.' It is the will of the Rhamdas that the great Bar Senestro\r\nshall try the proof of the occult. On this, the first of the Sixteen\r\nDays, the test shall be--on the Spot of Life!”\r\n\r\nHe turned away. The Bar Senestro stripped off his jewels, his\r\nsemi-armour, and stood clad in the manner of Watson. They advanced and\r\nmet in the centre of the dais, two athletes, lithe, strong, handsome,\r\ntheir muscles aquiver with vitality and their skins silken with health.\r\nChampions of two worlds, to wrestle for truth!\r\n\r\nA low murmur arose, increasing until it filled the whole coliseum. The\r\nsilver-bronze pheasants flitted above the heads of all, flashing like\r\nfragments of the spirit of light. And all of a sudden--\r\n\r\nOne of them fluttered down and lit on Watson's shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe murmur of the throng dropped to a dead silence. Next moment\r\na stranger thing happened. The little creature broke forth in\r\nfull-throated song.\r\n\r\nWatson instantly remembered the words of the Bar Senestro: “They sing\r\nbut for the Jarados.” He quietly reached up and caught the songster\r\nin his hand, and he held it up to the astonished crowd. Still the song\r\ncontinued. Chick held him an instant longer, and then gave him a toss\r\nhigh into the air. He shot across the temple, a streak of melody,\r\nsilver, dulcet, to the far corner of the giant building.\r\n\r\nBut the thing did not jar the Senestro.\r\n\r\n“Well done, Sir Phantom! Anyhow, 'tis your last play! I would not have\r\nit otherwise. I hope you can die as prettily! Are you ready?”\r\n\r\n“Ready? What for?” retorted Watson. “Why, should I trouble myself with\r\npreparations?”\r\n\r\nBut the Rhamda Geos had now come to his side.\r\n\r\n“Do your best, my lord. I regret only that it must be to the death.\r\nIt is the first death contest in the Thomahlia for a thousand circles\r\n(years). But the Senestro has challenged the prophecy. Prove that you\r\nare not a false one! My heart is with you.”\r\n\r\nIt was a good word at a needed moment. Watson stepped over onto the\r\ncircular Spot of Life.\r\n\r\nThey were both barefooted. Evidently the Thomahlians fought in the old,\r\nclassic manner. The stone under Watson's feet was cool and invigorating.\r\nHe could sense anew that quiver of magnetism and strength. It sent a\r\nthrill through his whole body, like the subtle quickening of life. He\r\nfelt vital, joyous, confident.\r\n\r\nThe Senestro was smiling, his eyes flashing with anticipation. His\r\nmuscled body was a network of soft movement. His step was catlike.\r\n\r\n“What will it be?” inquired Watson. “Name your choice of destruction.”\r\n\r\nBut the Bar shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Not so, Sir Phantom. You shall choose the manner of your death, not I.\r\nParticular I am not, nor selfish.”\r\n\r\n“Make it wrestling, then,” in his most off-hand manner. He was a good\r\nwrestler, and scientific.\r\n\r\n“Good. Are you ready?”\r\n\r\n“Quite.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Sir Phantom. I shall walk to the edge of the Spot and turn\r\naround. I would take no unfair advantage. Now!”\r\n\r\nChick turned at the same moment and strode to his edge. He turned,\r\nand it happened; just what, Chick never knew. He remembered seeing his\r\nopponent turn slowly about, and in the next split second he was spinning\r\nin the clutch of a tiger. Even before they struck the stone, Chick could\r\nfeel the Senestro reaching for a death-hold.\r\n\r\nAnd in that one second Watson knew that he was in the grip of his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nHis mind functioned like lightning. His legs and arms flashed for the\r\ncounterhold that would save him. They struck the Spot and rolled over\r\nand over. Chick caught his hold, but the Senestro broke it almost\r\ninstantly. Yet it had saved him; for a minute they spun around like a\r\npair of whirligigs. Watson kept on the defensive. He had not the speed\r\nand skill of the other. It was no mere test to touch his shoulders;\r\nit was a fight to the death; he was at a disadvantage. He worked\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nWhen a man fights for his life he becomes superhuman. Watson was put to\r\nsomething more than his skill; the sheer spirit of the Bar broke hold\r\nafter hold; he was like lightning, panther-like, subtle, vicious. Time\r\nafter time he spun Chick out of his defense and bore him down into\r\na hold of death. And each time Chick somehow wriggled out, and saved\r\nhimself by a new hold. The struggle became a blur--muscle, legs, the\r\nlust for killing--and hatred. Twice Watson essayed the offensive; first\r\nhe got a hammer lock, and then a half-Nelson. The Bar broke both holds\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nWhatever Chick knew of wrestling, the Senestro knew just a bit more. It\r\nwas a whirling mass of legs and bodies in continuous convulsion,\r\nsilent except for the terrible panting of the men, and the low, stifled\r\nexclamations of the onlookers.\r\n\r\nAnd then--\r\n\r\nWatson grew weak. He tried once more. They spun to their feet. But\r\nbefore he could act the Senestro had caught him in the same flying rush\r\nas in the beginning, and had whirled him off his feet. And when he came\r\ndown the Bar had an unbreakable hold.\r\n\r\nChick struggled in vain. The Bar tightened his grip. A spasm of pain\r\nshot through Chick's torso; he could feel his bones giving way. His\r\nstrength was gone; he could see death. Another moment would have been\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nBut something happened. The Senestro miraculously let go his hold. Chick\r\nfelt something soft brush against his cheek. He heard a queer snapping,\r\nand shouts of wonder, and a dreadful choking sound from the Bar. He\r\nraised dizzily on one arm. His eyes cleared a bit.\r\n\r\nThe great Bar was on his back; and at his throat was a snarling\r\nthing--the creature that Chick had seen in the clover leaf of the\r\nJarados.\r\n\r\nIt was a living dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII.  PAT MACPHERSON'S STORY\r\n\r\nTo Watson it was all a blur. He was too weak and too broken to remember\r\ndistinctly. He was conscious only of an uproar, of a torrent of\r\nmultitudinous sound. And then--the deep, enveloping tone of a bell.\r\n\r\nSome time, somewhere, Chick had heard that bell before. In his present\r\ncondition his memory refused to serve him. He was covered with blood; he\r\ntried to rise, to crawl to this snarling animal that was throttling the\r\nSenestro. But something seemed to snap within him, and all went black.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes again all had changed. He was lying on a couch\r\nwith a number of people about. It was a minute before he recognized the\r\nJan Lucar, then the Geos, and lastly the nurse whom he had first seen\r\nwhen he awoke in the Blind Spot. Evidently he was in the hands of his\r\nfriends, although there was a new one, a red-headed man, clad in the\r\nblue uniform of a high Bar.\r\n\r\nHe sat up. The nurse held a goblet of the green liquid to his lips. The\r\nBar in blue turned.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” he said. “Give him some of the liquor; it will do him good. It\r\nwill put the old energy back in his bones.”\r\n\r\nThe voice rang oddly familiar in Watson's ears. The words were\r\nThomahlian; not until Chick had drained his glass did he comprehend\r\ntheir significance.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Bar with the red hair grinned.\r\n\r\n“Whist, me lad,” using Chick's own tongue. “Get rid of these\r\nThomahlians. 'Tis a square game we're playin', but we're takin' no\r\nchances. Get 'em out of the way so we kin talk.”\r\n\r\nWatson turned to the others. He made the request in his adopted tongue.\r\nThey bowed, reverently, and withdrew.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” Chick asked again.\r\n\r\n“Oi'm Pat MacPherson.”\r\n\r\n“How did you get here?”\r\n\r\nThe other sat on the edge of the bed. “Faith, how kin Oi tell ye? 'Twas\r\na drink, sor; a new kind av a high-ball, th' trickery av a friend an'\r\nth' ould Witch av Endor put togither.”\r\n\r\nObviously Watson did not understand. The stranger continued: “Faith,\r\nsor, an' no more do Oi. There's no one as does, 'cept th' ould doc\r\nhisself.”\r\n\r\n“The old doc! You mean Dr. Holcomb?”\r\n\r\nWatson sat up in his bed. “Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“In a safe place, me lad. Dinna fear for th' doctor. 'Twas him as saved\r\nye--him an' your humble sarvant, Pat MacPherson, bedad.”\r\n\r\n“He--and you--saved me?”\r\n\r\n“Aye--there on th' Spot of Life. A bit of a thrick as th' ould doc dug\r\noot o' his wisdom. Sure, she dinna work jist loike he said it, but 'twas\r\na plenty t' oopset th' pretty Senestro!”\r\n\r\nWatson asked, “What became of the Senestro?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, they pulled him oot. Th' wee doggie jist aboot had him done for.\r\nBedad, she's a good pup!”\r\n\r\n“What kind of a dog?”\r\n\r\n“A foine wan, sor, wit a bit stub av a tail. An' she's that intelligent,\r\nshe kin jist about talk Frinch. Th' Thomahlians all called her th'\r\nFour-footed, an' if they kape on, they'll jist aboot make her th' Pope.”\r\n\r\nWatson was still thick headed. “I don't understand!”\r\n\r\n“Nor I laddie. But th' ould doc does. He's got a foine head for figgers;\r\nand' he's that scientific, he kin make iron oot o' rainbows.”\r\n\r\n“Iron out of--what?”\r\n\r\n“Rainbows, sor. Faith, 'tis meself thot's seen it. And he's been\r\nwatchin' over ye ever since ye came. 'Twas hisself, lad, that put it\r\ninto your head t' call him th' Jarados.”\r\n\r\n“You don't mean to say that the professor put those impulses into my\r\nhead!”\r\n\r\n“Aye, laddie; you said it. He kin build up a man's thoughts just\r\nlike you or me kin pile oop lumber. 'Tis that deep he is wit' th'\r\ncalculations!”\r\n\r\nWatson tried to think. There was just one superlative question now. He\r\nput it.\r\n\r\n“I dinna know if he's th' Jarados,” was the reply. “But if so be not,\r\nthen he's his twin brother, sure enough.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldna say that, though there's them as think so. But if it be\r\nanybody as is holdin' him, 'tis the Senestro an' his gang o' guards.”\r\n\r\nWatson looked at the other's uniform, at the purple shako on his\r\nhead, the jewelled weapon at his side, and the Jaradic leaf on his\r\nshoulder--insignia of a Bar of the highest rank.\r\n\r\n“How does it come that you're a Bar, and a high one at that?”\r\n\r\nThe other grinned again. He took off his shako and ran his hand through\r\nhis mop of red hair.\r\n\r\n“'Tis aither th' luck of th' Irish, me lad, or of th' Scotch. Oi don't\r\nken which--Oi'm haff each--but mostly 'tis th' virtoo av me bonny red\r\nhair.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because, leastways, in th' Thomahlia, there's always a dhrop av royalty\r\nin th' red-headed. Me bonnie top-knot has made me a fortune. Ye see,\r\n'tis th' mark av th' royal Bars themselves; no ithers have it.”\r\n\r\nWatson said: “If you have come from Dr. Holcomb, then you must have a\r\nmessage from him to me.”\r\n\r\n“Ye've said it; you an' me, an' a few Rhamdas, an' mebbe th' wee queen\r\nis goin' t' take a flight in th' June Bug. We're goin' afther th' ould\r\ndoc; an' ye kin bet there'll be as pretty a scrap as ever ye looked\r\non. An' afther thot's all over, we're goin' t' take anither kind of a\r\nflight--into good old Frisco.”\r\n\r\nChick instantly asked Pat if he knew where San Francisco might be.\r\n\r\n“Faith, 'tis only th' ould doc knows, laddie. But when we git there,\r\n'tis Pat MacPherson that's a goin' for Toddy Maloney.”\r\n\r\n“I don't know that name.”\r\n\r\n“Bedad, I do. Him it was thot give me th' dhrink.”\r\n\r\n“What drink?”\r\n\r\nTh' dhrink thot done it. Twas a new kind av cocktail. Ye see, I'd jist\r\ngot back from Melbourne, an' I was takin' in th' lights that noight,\r\naisy like, whin I come t' Toddy's place. I orders a dhrink av whuskey.\r\n\r\n“'Whist, Pat,' says he, 'ye don't want whuskey; 'twill make ye dhrunk.\r\nWhy don't ye take somethin' green, like th' Irish?'\r\n\r\n“'Green,” says I. ''Tis a foine colour. I dinna fear anything thot comes\r\nfra' a bottle. Pass'er oot!'\r\n\r\n“An' thot he did. 'Twas 'creme de menthay' on th' bottle. 'An',' says\r\nhe, ''Twon't make ye dhrunk.' But he was a liar, beggin' yer pardin.\r\n\r\n“For by an' by Oi see his head a growin' larger an' larger, until Oi\r\ncouldn't see annything but a few loights on th' cailing, an' a few\r\npeople on th' edges, loike. An' afther thot Oi wint oot, an' walked\r\ntill Oi come to a hill. An' there was a moon, an' a ould hoose standin'\r\nstill, which th' moon was not. So Oi stood still to watch it, but bein'\r\ntired an' weary an' not havin' got rid o' me sea-legs, Oi sat me doon\r\non th' steps av th' hoose for a bit av a rest, an' t' watch th' moon,\r\nthinkin' mebbe she'd stand still by an' by.\r\n\r\n“Well, sor, Oi hadn't been there more'n three 'r four minits, whin th'\r\ndoor opened, an' oot steps a little ould lady, aboot th' littlest an'\r\nouldest Oi iver see in 'Frisco.\r\n\r\n“'Good avenin', Mother Machree,' says Oi, touchin' me hat.\r\n\r\n“'Mother Machree!' says she, an' gives me a sharp look. Also she sniffs.\r\n'Ye poor man,' says she. 'Ye'll catch yer death o' cold, out here. Ye\r\nbetter coom in an' lie on me sofy.'\r\n\r\n“Now, sor, how was Oi to ken, bein' a sailor an' ingorant? She was only\r\na ould lady, an' withered. How was Oi to ken thot she was th' ould Witch\r\no' Endor?”\r\n\r\nWatson's memory was at work on what he knew of the house at Chatterton\r\nPlace, especially regarding its occupants at the beginning of the Blind\r\nSpot mystery. The Bar's old remark caught his attention.\r\n\r\n“The Witch of Endor?”\r\n\r\n“Aye; thot she were. Whin Oi woke up, there was nary a hoose at all, nor\r\nth' ould lady, nor Toddy Maloney's, nor 'Frisco. 'Twas a strange place I\r\nwas, sor; a church loike St. Peter's, only bigger, th' same bein' harrd\r\nto belaive. An' th' columns looked loike waterspoots, an' th' sky above\r\nwas full av clouds, the same bein' jest aboot ready to break into hell\r\nan' tempest. But ye've been there yerself, sor.\r\n\r\n“Well, here was a man beside me, dressed in a kilt. An' he spakes a\r\nstrange language, although Oi could undershtand; and' he says, says he:\r\n\r\n“'My lord,' was what he says.\r\n\r\n“'My lord!' says Oi. 'Oi dinna ken what ye mane at all, at all.'\r\n\r\n“'Are ye not a Bar?' says he.\r\n\r\n“'Thot Oi am not!' says Oi, spakin' good English, so's to be sure he'd\r\nunderstand. 'Oi'm Pat MacPherson.'\r\n\r\n“But he couldn' ken. Thin we left th' temple an' wint out into the\r\nstreet. An' a great crowd of people came aroun' an' began shoutin'. By\r\nan' by we wint into anither buildin'.\r\n\r\n“'For why sh'd iverybody look at me whin we crossed th' street jest\r\nnoo?' I asked.\r\n\r\n“'Tis y'r clothes,' says he.\r\n\r\n“Now, Oi don't enjoy pooblicity, sor; wherefore th' wily Scotch in me\r\ntold me what to do, an' th' Irish part of me did it. I stood him on his\r\nhead, an' took his clothes off an' put them on meself. An' then no one\r\nnoticed me. Thot is, until Oi took me hat off.”\r\n\r\n“You mean, that shako?”\r\n\r\n“Yis; th' blaemd heavy thing--'tis made o' blue feathers. Well, whin it\r\ngot so hot it made me scalp sweat, Oi took it off; an' then they called\r\nme--'My lord' an' 'your worship,' jest loike Oi were a king.\r\n\r\n“'Pray God,' says Oi, 'that me head dinna get bald.'\r\n\r\n“Well, sor, Oi had a toime that was fit for th' Irish. Oi did iverything\r\n'cept git drunk; there was nothin' to git drunk with. But afther a while\r\nI ran across anither, wit' jest as red hair as I had. He was a foine\r\nman, av coorse, an' all surrounded by blue guards. He took me into a\r\nroom himself an' begin askin' questions.\r\n\r\n“An' I lied, sor. Av coorse, 'twas lucky thot Oi had me Scotch larnin'\r\nan' caution to guide me; but whin Oi spoke, Oi wisely let th' Irishman\r\ndo all th' talkin'. An' th' great Bar liked me.\r\n\r\n“'Verily,' says he, most solemnly, 'thou art of th' royal Bars!' An' he\r\nmade me a high officer, he did.”\r\n\r\n“Was he the Bar Senestro?” asked Watson.\r\n\r\n“Nay; 'twas a far better man--Senestro's brother, that died not long\r\nafter. When Oi saw th' Senestro, Oi had sinse enough to kape me mouth\r\nshut. An' now Oi'm a high Bar--next to th' Senestro hisself! What's\r\nmore, sor, there's no one alive kens th' truth but yerself an' th' ould\r\ndoctor.”\r\n\r\nIt was a queer story, but in the light of all that had gone before,\r\nwonderfully convincing. Watson began to see light breaking through the\r\ndarkness. “Now there are two,” the old lady at 288 Chatterton Place\r\nhad said to Jerome, when the detective came looking for the vanished\r\nprofessor. Had she referred to Holcomb and MacPherson? Two had gone\r\nthrough the Blind Spot, and two had come out--the Rhamda Avec and the\r\nNervina. “Now there are two,” she had said.\r\n\r\n“Tell me a little more about Holcomb, Pat!”\r\n\r\n“'Tis a short story. Oi can't tell ye much, owin' to orders from the\r\nold gent hisself. He came shortly after th' death of the first Bar,\r\nSenestro's brother. Seems there was some rumpus aboot th' old Rhamda\r\nAvec, which same Oi always kept away from--him as was goin' to prove th'\r\nspirits! Annyhow, we was guardin' th' temple awaitin' th' spook as was\r\npromised. An' thot's how we got th' ould doc.\r\n\r\n“But th' Rhamdas niver saw him. Th' Senestro double-crossed 'em, an'\r\nslipped th' doctor oop to th' Palace av Light.”\r\n\r\n“The Palace of--what?”\r\n\r\n“The Palace av light, sor. Tis th' home av th' Jarados. 'twas held\r\nalways holy by th' Thomahlians; no man dared go within miles av it;\r\nsince the Jarados was here, t'ousands of years ago, no one at all has\r\nbeen inside av it.\r\n\r\n“But the Senestro knew that th' doctor was th' real Jarados, at least he\r\nt'ought so; an' he wasna afraid o' him. He's na coward, th' Senestro.\r\nHe put th' doctor in th' Jarados' home! Only th' Prophecy worries him at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nAt last Watson was touching firm ground. Things were beginning to link\r\nup--the Senestro, the professor, the Prophecy of the Jarados.\r\n\r\n“Well, sor, we Bars have kept th' ould doctor prisoner there iver since\r\nhe come, wit' none save me to give him a wee bit word av comfort. But it\r\ndinna hurt th' old gent. Whin he finds all them balls an' rainbows an'\r\neddicated secrets, he forgets iverything else; he's contint wit 'his\r\ndiscovery. 'Tis th' wise head th' doctor has; an' Oi make no doobt he's\r\nth' real Jarados.”\r\n\r\nThe red-haired man went on to say that the professor knew of Chick's\r\ncoming from the beginning. He immediately called in MacPherson and gave\r\nhim some orders, or rather directions, which the Irishman could not\r\nunderstand. He knew only that he was to go to the Temple of the Leaf and\r\nthere touch certain objects in a certain way; also, he was to arrange to\r\nget near Chick, and give him a word of cheer.\r\n\r\n“But it dinna work as he said it, sor; he had expected to catch th'\r\nSenestro. Instead, 'twas th' dog got th' Bar. A foine pup, sor; she\r\nsaved yer loife.”\r\n\r\n“Where's the dog now?”\r\n\r\n“She's on th' Spot av Life, sor. She willna leave it. Tis a strange\r\nthing to see how she clings to it. Th' Rhamdas only come near enough to\r\nfeed her.”\r\n\r\nThus Chick learned that, as soon as he got well, he and MacPherson were\r\nto seek the doctor, and help him to get away with the secrets he had\r\nfound, the truths behind the mystery of the Spot.\r\n\r\n“An' 'tis a glorious fight there'll be, lad. Th' Senestro's a game wan;\r\nhe'll not give up, an' he'll not let go th' doctor till he has to.”\r\n\r\nThis was not unwelcome news to Chick. A battle was to his liking.\r\nIt reminded him of the automatic pistol which he still had in his\r\npocket--the gun he had not thought to use in his desperate struggle with\r\nthe Bar Senestro.\r\n\r\n“Pat,” said he, with a sudden inspriation, “when you came through, did\r\nyou have a firearm?”\r\n\r\nMacPherson reached into his pocket and silently produced a thirty-two\r\ncalibre pistol, of another make than Chick's but using the same\r\nammunition. From another pocket he drew out a package carefully bound\r\nwith thread. He unrolled the contents. It was an old clay pipe!\r\n\r\n“Oi came through,” he stated plaintively, “wit' two guns; an' nary a bit\r\nav powder for ayther!”\r\n\r\nChick smiled. He searched his own pockets. First he handed over his\r\nextra magazine full of cartridges, and then a full package of smoking\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\n“Wirra, wirra!” shouted MacPherson. “Faith, an' there's powder for\r\nboth!” His hands shook as he hurried to cram the old pipe full of\r\ntobacco. The cartridges could wait. He struck a light and gave a deep\r\nsigh of content as he began to puff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\nTHE HOME OF THE JARADOS\r\n\r\n\r\nChick had been grievously hurt in the contest with the Senestro, but\r\nthanks to the Rhamdas he came round rapidly. It was a matter of less\r\nthan a week.\r\n\r\nThings were coming to a climax; Chick needed no lynx's eye to see\r\nthat the die had been cast between the Bars and the Rhamdas. Soon the\r\nSenestro must make a bold move, or else release the professor.\r\n\r\nChick had not long to wait. It came one evening. Once again he found\r\nhimself in the June Bug, accompanied by the Geos, the Jan Lucar,\r\nand--the little Aradna herself. Their departure was swift and secret.\r\n\r\nThis time Watson was not worried over height, or any other sensation of\r\nflight. The doctor's safety alone was of moment. He said to the Rhamda:\r\n\r\n“Are we alone? Where is the Bar MacPherson?”\r\n\r\n“He is somewhere near; we are not alone, my lord. Several other machines\r\nare flying nearby also; they carry many of the Rhamdas and the crimson\r\nguard of the queen. The MacPherson will arrive first. We are going\r\nstraight to the Palace of Light, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Are we to storm the place?” thinking of the fight MacPherson had\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord. Many shall die; but it cannot be helped. We must free the\r\nJarados, although we commit sacrilege.”\r\n\r\n“But--the Senestro?”\r\n\r\n“That depends, my lord. We know not just what may be done.” He gave no\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThey had climbed to a tremendous height. The indicator showed that they\r\nwere bearing east. The darkness was modified only by the faint glow from\r\nthat star-dusted sky. Looking down, Chick could see nothing whatever.\r\nHis companions kept silence; only the Aradna, sitting forward by the\r\nside of Jan Lucar showed any perturbation. They climbed higher and\r\nhigher still, until it seemed that they must leave the Thomahlia\r\naltogether. Always the course was eastward. At last the Jan said to the\r\nGeos:\r\n\r\n“We are now over the Region of Carbon, sir. Shall I risk the light? His\r\nlordship might like to see.”\r\n\r\n“Follow your own judgment.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” exclaimed the Aradna; “do it by all means! There is nothing so\r\nwonderful as that!”\r\n\r\nThe Jan touched a small lever. Instantly a shaft of light cut down\r\nthrough the blackness. Far, far below it ended in a patch on the ground.\r\nWatson eagerly followed its movements as it searched from side to side,\r\nseeking he knew not what. And then--\r\n\r\nThere was a flash of inverted lightning, a flame of white fire, a\r\nblinding, stabbing scintillation of a million coruscations. Watson\r\nclapped a hand to his eyes, to cut off the sight. It was stunning.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Carbon,” answered the Geos, calmly.\r\n\r\n“Carbon! You mean--diamond?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord. So it interests you? I did not know. Later you shall see\r\nit under more favourable conditions.” Then, to the Jan: “Enough.”\r\n\r\nOnce again they were in darkness. For some minutes silence was again the\r\nrule. Watson watched the red dot moving across the indicator, noting its\r\napproach to a three cornered figure on one edge. Suddenly there appeared\r\nanother dot; then another, and another. Some came from below, others\r\nfrom above; presently there were a score moving in close formation.\r\n\r\n“They are all here,” said the Jan to the Geos.\r\n\r\nThe other nodded, and explained to Chick: “It's the Rhamdas and the\r\nCrimson guards. The MacPherson is just ahead. We shall arrive in three\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nAnd after a pause he stated that the ensuing combat would mark the\r\nfirst spilling of blood between the Bars and the Rhamdas. At a pinch the\r\nSenestro might even kill the Jarados, to gain his ends. “His wish is his\r\nonly law, my lord.”\r\n\r\nThe red dots began to descend toward the three-cornered figure. One\r\nminute passed, and another; then one more, and the June Bug landed.\r\n\r\nWith scarcely a sound the Lucar brought the craft to a full stop. In a\r\nmoment he was assisting the Aradna to alight. As for the Geos, he took\r\nfrom the machine two objects, which he held out to the Aradna and to\r\nChick.\r\n\r\n“Put these on. The rest of us fight as we are.”\r\n\r\nThey were cloaks, made of a soft, light, malleable glass, or something\r\nlike it. Watson asked what they were for.\r\n\r\n“For a purpose known only to the Jarados, my lord. There are only two of\r\nthese robes. With them he left directions which indicated plainly they\r\nare for your lordship and the Aradna.”\r\n\r\nWondering, Chick helped the Aradna don her garment and then slipped\r\ninto his own. Nevertheless, he pinned more faith in the automatic in his\r\npocket. He did not make use of the hood which was intended to cover his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” spoke the queen. She reached over and extended the hood\r\ntill it protected his skull. “Please wear it that way, for my sake.\r\nNothing must happen to you now!”\r\n\r\nChick obeyed with only an inward demur. What puzzled him most was the\r\nisolation. Seemingly they were quite alone; there was nothing, no one,\r\nto oppose them.\r\n\r\nBut he had merely taken something for granted. He, being from the earth,\r\nhad assumed that strife meant noise. It was only when the Aradna caught\r\nhim by the arm, and whispered for him to listen, that he understood.\r\n\r\nIt was like a breeze, that sound. To be more precise, it was like the\r\nheavy passage of breath, almost uninterrupted, coming from all about\r\nthem. And presently Chick caught a queer odour.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he breathed in the Aradna's ear.\r\n\r\n“It is death,” she answered. “Cannot you hear them--the deherers?”\r\n\r\nShe did not explain; but Watson knew that he was in the midst of\r\na battle which was fought with noiseless and terribly efficient\r\nweapons--so efficient that there were no wounded to give voice to pain.\r\nBefore he could ask a question a familiar voice sounded out of the\r\ndarkness at his side.\r\n\r\n“Where is the Geos?”\r\n\r\n“Here, Bar MacPherson,” answered the Rhamda.\r\n\r\n“Good! It is well you came, sir. We were discovered a few minutes ago;\r\nalready we have lost many men. Just give us the lights, so that we\r\ncan get at them! It is a waste of men, with the advantage all on their\r\nside.”\r\n\r\nThen, lapsing into English for Chick's benefit: “'Tis welcome ye are!\r\nIvery mon helps, how.”\r\n\r\n“What are these sounds? You say they are fighting?”\r\n\r\n“'Tis the deherers ye hear, lad. They fight with silent guns. Don't let\r\n'em hit ye, or ye'll be a pink pool in the twinklin' of yer eyelid. 'Tis\r\nno joke.\r\n\r\n“Are they more powerful than firearms?”\r\n\r\n“I dinna say, lad. But they're th' devil's own weapon for fightin'.”\r\n\r\nChick did not answer--he had heard a low command from the Geos. Next\r\ninstant the space before them was illuminated by clear white light, in\r\nthe form of a circle--bright as day. In the centre shimmered an object\r\nlike a mist of blue flame, a nimbus of dazzling, actinic lightning.\r\nThere was no sign of man or life, no suggestion of sound--nothing but\r\nthe nimbus, and the brilliant space about it. The whole phenomenon\r\nmeasured perhaps three hundred feet across.\r\n\r\nThey were in darkness. Chick took a step forward, but he was held back\r\nby MacPherson.\r\n\r\n“Nay, lad; would ye be dyin' so soon? 'Tis fearful quick. See--”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish. A red line of soldiers had rushed straight out of the\r\nblackness into the circle of light. It seemed that they were charging\r\nthe nimbus. They were stooping now, discharging their queer weapons;\r\nabout three hundred of them--an inspiring sight. They charged in\r\ndetermined silence.\r\n\r\nThen--Watson blinked. The line disappeared; the thing was like a\r\nmiracle. It took time for Chick to realise that he was looking upon\r\nthe “pink death” MacPherson had warned him against--the work of the\r\ndeherers, whatever the word meant. For where had been a column of\r\ngallant guards there was now only a broad stream of pink liquid\r\ntrickling over the ground. It was annihilation itself--too quick to\r\nbe horrible--inexorable and instantaneous. Chick involuntarily placed\r\nhimself in front of the Aradna.\r\n\r\n“The blue thing in the middle,” observed the Irishman, coolly, “is th'\r\nPalace av Light; 'tis held by th' Senestro jest now. An' all we got to\r\ndo is get th' ould doc out.”\r\n\r\n“But I see no building!”\r\n\r\n“'Tis there jest the same. Ye'll see it whin th' doctor gits time off\r\nhis rainbows. 'Tis absent-minded he gets when he's on a problem, which\r\nsame is mostly always, sor. We stay roight here till he gets ready to\r\ndrop on th' Senestro.”\r\n\r\nWatson waited. He knew enough now to cling to the shadow, there with\r\nMacPherson, the Geos, and the Aradna. In the centre of the great\r\nlight-circle the nimbus of blue stood out like a vibrating haze, while\r\nall about, in the darkness, could be heard the weird sound made by the\r\npassage of life.\r\n\r\n“When will the Jarados act?” inquired the Geos of the Irishman. But he\r\ngot no reply. MacPherson spoke to Watson: “Get yer gun ready, lad; get\r\nyer gun ready! Look--'tis th' ould boy himself, now! I wonder what the\r\nSenestro thinks of that?”\r\n\r\nFor the nimbus had suddenly dissolved, and in its place there appeared\r\none of the quaintest, yet most beautiful buildings that Watson had ever\r\nseen. It was a three-cornered structure, low-set, and of unspeakably\r\ndazzling magnificence; a building carved and chiselled from solid\r\ncarbon. Chick momentarily forgot the doctor.\r\n\r\nIn front of it stood a line of Blue Guards, headed by the Senestro.\r\nTheir confusion showed that something altogether unexpected had\r\nhappened. They were ducking here and there, seemingly bewildered by the\r\nsudden vanishing of that protecting blue dazzle. The Senestro was trying\r\nto restore order; and in a moment he succeeded. He led the way toward a\r\nlow, triangular platform, at the entrance--a single white door--to the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nPat MacPherson's automatic flashed and barked. Next instant Watson\r\nwas in action. The Bar next to the Senestro staggered, then collapsed\r\nagainst his chieftain. Another rolled against his feet, causing him\r\nto stumble; an act that probably saved his life, for the platform in a\r\nsecond was covered with writhing, bleeding, dying Bars.\r\n\r\nThe Senestro managed to reach the doorway. MacPherson cursed.\r\n\r\n“Come on!” he yelled to Watson. “Well git him alive!” Watson remembered\r\nlittle of that rush. There stood the great Bar at the doorway,\r\nsurrounded by his dying and panic-stricken men. The cloak given Chick by\r\nthe Geos impeded his progress; with a quick movement he threw it off and\r\nran unprotected alongside the Irishman. The Blue guards saw them coming;\r\nthey levelled their weapons. But before they could discharge them they\r\nmet the same fate as had the Reds. A tremor in the air, and they were\r\ngone, leaving only a pink pool on the ground.\r\n\r\nSenestro alone remained untouched. He was about to open the white door;\r\nfor a second he posed, defiant and handsome. Then the great Bar ducked\r\nswiftly and almost with the same motion dodged into the building. Chick\r\nand Pat were right after him.\r\n\r\nInside was darkness. Chick ran head on against the side wall; turning,\r\nhe bumped into another. The sudden transition from brilliance\r\nto blackness was overwhelming. He stopped and felt about\r\ncarefully--momentarily blind. What if the Senestro found him now?\r\n\r\nHe called MacPherson's name. There was no reply. He tried to feel his\r\nway along, finding the wall irregular, jagged, sharp cornered. But the\r\nway must lead somewhere. He reached a turn in the passage; it was\r\nstill too dark for him to see anything. He proceeded more cautiously,\r\nwondering at those craggy walls. And then--\r\n\r\nChick slapped his hands to his eyes. It was as if he had been shot into\r\nthe core of the sun--the obsidian darkness flashed into light--a light\r\nbeyond all enduring. Chick staggered, and cried in pain. And yet, reason\r\ntold him just what it was, just what had happened. It was the carbon; he\r\nwas in the heart of the diamond; the Senestro had led him on and on, and\r\nthen--had flashed some intense light upon the vast jewel. Watson knew\r\nthe terrible helplessness of the blind. His end had come!\r\n\r\nAnd so it seemed. Next instant someone came up to him--someone he could\r\nhear if he could not see. It was the Senestro.\r\n\r\n“Hail, Sir Phantom! Pardon my abrupt manner of welcome. I suppose you\r\nhave come for the Jarados?” And he laughed, a laugh full of mockery and\r\ntriumph. “Perhaps you think I intend to kill you?”\r\n\r\nWatson said no word. He had been outwitted. He awaited the end. But the\r\nSenestro saw fit to say, with an irony that told how sure he was:\r\n\r\n“However, I am opposed to killing in cold blood. Open your eyes, Sir\r\nPhantom! I will give you time--a fair chance. What do you say--shall we\r\nmatch weapon against weapon?”\r\n\r\nWatson slowly opened his eyes. The blinding light had dimmed to a soft\r\nglow. They were in a sort of gallery whose length was uncertain;\r\nbetween him and the outlet, about ten feet away, stood the confident,\r\never-smiling Bar.\r\n\r\n“You or I,” said he, jauntily. “Are you ready to try it? I have given\r\nyou a fair chance!”\r\n\r\nHe raised his dagger-like weapon, as though aiming it. At the same\r\ninstant Chick pulled the trigger from the hip, snap aim.\r\n\r\nThe gun was empty.\r\n\r\nAnother second, and Watson would have been like those spots of colour\r\non the ground outside. He breathed a prayer to his Maker. The Senestro's\r\nweapon was in line with his throat.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be. There came a flash and a stunning report; the\r\ndeherer clattered against the wall, and the Senestro clutched a stinging\r\nhand. He was staring in surprise at something behind Chick--something\r\nthat made him turn and dart out of sight.\r\n\r\nChick wheeled.\r\n\r\nRight behind him stood the familiar form of the Jan Lucar; and a few\r\nfeet beyond, a figure from which came a clear, cool, nonchalant voice;\r\n\r\n“I would have killed that fellow, Chick, but he's too damned handsome.\r\nI'm going to save him for a specimen.”\r\n\r\nWatson peered closer. He gave a gasp, half of amazement, half of\r\ndelight. For the words were in English, and the voice--\r\n\r\nIt was Harry Wendel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\n\r\nDR. HOLCOMB'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there was the least doubt in Chick's mind that this was really Harry,\r\nit was dispelled by the sight of the person who the next moment stepped\r\nup to his side. It was none other than the Nervina.\r\n\r\n“Harry Wendel!” gasped Watson. It was too good to be true!\r\n\r\n“Surest thing you know, Chick. It's me, alive and kicking!” as they\r\ngrabbed one another.\r\n\r\n“How did you get here?”\r\n\r\n“Search me! Ask the lady; I'm just a creature of circumstance. I merely\r\nact; she does all the thinking.”\r\n\r\nThe Nervina smiled and nodded. Her eyes were just as wonderful as\r\nChick remembered them, full of elusiveness, of the moonbeam's light, of\r\nwitchery past understanding.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she affirmed. “You see, Mr. Watson, it is the will of the\r\nProphet. Harry is of the Chosen. We have come for the great Dr.\r\nHolcomb--for the Jarados!”\r\n\r\nAnd she led the way. Watson followed in silent wonder; behind him came\r\nthe Geos and the rest, quiet and reverent. The soft glow still held, so\r\nthat they seemed to be walking through the walls of cold fire. At the\r\nend of the passage they came to a door.\r\n\r\nThe Nervina touched three unmarked spots on the walls. The door opened.\r\nThe queen stood aside, and motioned for Chick and Harry to enter.\r\n\r\nIt was a long room, pear-shaped, and fitted up like the most elaborate\r\nsort of laboratory. And at the far end, seated in the midst of a strange\r\narray of crystals, retorts and unfamiliar apparatus, was a man whom the\r\ntwo instantly recognised.\r\n\r\nIt was the missing professor, looking just as they remembered him from\r\nthe days when they sat in his class in Berkeley. There was the same trim\r\nfigure, the same healthy cheeks, pleasant eyes and close-cropped\r\nwhite beard. Always there had been something imperturbable about the\r\ndoctor--he had that poise and equanimity which is ever the balance of\r\nsound judgment. Neither Chick nor Harry expected any rush of emotion,\r\nand they were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nHolcomb rose to his feet, revealing on the table before him a queer,\r\ndancing light which he had been studying. He touched something; the\r\nlight vanished, and simultaneously there came an unnameable change in\r\nthe appearance of certain of those puzzling crystals. The doctor stepped\r\nforward, hand extended, smiling; surely he did not look or act like a\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” spoke he; “at last! Chick Watson and Harry Wendel! You're\r\nvery welcome. Was it a long journey?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes twinkled in the old way. He didn't wait for their replies. He\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n“Have we solved the Blind Spot? It seems that my pupils never desert me.\r\nLet me ask: have you solved the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\n“We've solved nothing, professor. What we have come for is, first,\r\nyourself; and second, for the secrets you have found. It is for us to\r\nask--what is the Blind Spot?”\r\n\r\nThe professor shook his head.\r\n\r\n“You were always a poor guesser, Mr. Wendel. Perhaps Chick, now--”\r\n\r\n“Put me down as unprepared,” answered Chick. “I'm like Harry--I want to\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps there are a lot of us in the same fix,” laughed Holcomb. “We,\r\nwho know more than any men who ever lived, want to know still more! It\r\nmay be, after all, that we know very little; even though we have solved\r\nthe problem.” His eyes twinkled again, aggravatingly.\r\n\r\n“Tell us, then!” from Harry, on impulse as always. “What is the Blind\r\nSpot?”\r\n\r\nBut Holcomb shook his head. “Not just now, Harry; we have company.”\r\n The Geos and the Jan had entered. “Besides, I am not quite ready. There\r\nremain several tangles to be unravelled.”\r\n\r\nAs he shook hands with the Geos, he spoke in the Thomahlian tongue. “You\r\nare more than welcome.”\r\n\r\nThe Rhamda bent low in reverence and awe. His voice was hushed. He\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n“Art thou the Jarados, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” stated the doctor. “I am he; I am the Jarados!”\r\n\r\nIt was a stagger for both young men. Neither could reconcile the great\r\nprofessor of his schooldays with this strange, philosophic prophet of\r\nthe occult Thomahlians. What was the connection? What was the fate that\r\nwas leading, urging, compelling it all?\r\n\r\n“Professor, you will pardon our eagerness. Both Harry and I have had\r\nadventures, without understanding what it was all about. Can't you\r\nexplain? Where are we? And--why?” And then:\r\n\r\n“Your lecture on the Blind Spot! You promised it to us--can you deliver\r\nit now?”\r\n\r\nThe professor smiled his acknowledgement.\r\n\r\n“Part of it,” he said; “enough to answer your questions to some extent.\r\nHad I stayed in Berkeley I could have delivered it all, but”--and he\r\nlaughed--“I know a whole lot more, now; and, paradoxically, I know far\r\nless! First let me speak to the Geos.” He learned that the struggle\r\noutside had terminated successfully for the Rhamda and his men. All was\r\nquiet. The Senestro had made his escape in safety back to the Mahovisal.\r\nThe doctor ordered that he was not to be molested.\r\n\r\nThe Geos and the others left the room, escorting the Aradna, who was\r\ntoo exhausted for further experiences. There remained with the doctor,\r\nChick, Harry, and the Nervina.\r\n\r\n“I will reduce that lecture to synopsis form,” began the professor. “I\r\nshall tell you all that I know, up to this moment. First, however, let\r\nme show you something.”\r\n\r\nHe indicated the table from which he had risen. Chief among the objects\r\non its top were fragments of minerals, some familiar, some strange.\r\nAbove and on all sides were the crystal globes or, at least, what Chick\r\nnamed as such--erected upon as many tripods. One of these the professor\r\nmoved toward the table.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously a tiny dot appeared on a small metal plate in the centre\r\nof the table. At first almost invisible, it grew, after a minute or so,\r\nto a definite bit of matter.\r\n\r\nThe professor moved the tripod away. Nearby crystals, inside of\r\nwhich some dull lights had leaped into momentary being, subsided into\r\nquiescence. And the three observers looked again and again at the solid\r\nfragment of material that had grown before their eyes on that table.\r\n\r\nSomething had been made out of nothing!\r\n\r\nThe doctor picked it up and held it unconcernedly in his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Can anybody tell me,” asked he, “what this is?”\r\n\r\nThere was no answer. The professor tossed the thing back on the table.\r\nIt gave forth a sharp, metallic sound.\r\n\r\n“You are looking at ether,” spoke he. “It is the ether itself--nothing\r\nelse. You call it matter; others would call it iron; but those are\r\nmerely names. I call it ether in motion--materialised force-coherent\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\n“Like everything else in the universe it answers to a law. It has its\r\nreason--there is no such thing as chance. Do you follow? That fragment\r\nis simply a principle, allowed to manifest itself through a natural law!\r\n\r\n“Try to follow me. All is out of the ether--all! Variety in matter is\r\nsimply a question of varying degrees of electronic activity, depending\r\nupon a number of ratios. Life itself, as well as materiality and force,\r\ncomes out of the all-pervading ether.\r\n\r\n“This object here,” touching the crystal, “is merely a conductor. It\r\npicks up the ether and sends it through a set degree of vibrational\r\nactivity. Result? It makes iron!\r\n\r\n“If you wish you may go back to our twentieth century for a parallel--by\r\nwhich I mean, electricity. It is gathered crudely; but the time will\r\ncome when it will be picked up out of the air in precisely the same\r\nmanner that men pick hydrocarbons out of petroleum, or as I sift the\r\ndesired quality of ether through that globe.\r\n\r\n“This, I am convinced, is one of the fundamental secrets of the Blind\r\nSpot. Is there any question?”\r\n\r\nWendel managed to put one.\r\n\r\n“You said, 'back in the twentieth century.' Is it a question of time\r\ndisplacement, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Suppose we forgo that point at present. You will note, however, that\r\nthe Thomahlian world is certainly far in advance of our own.”\r\n\r\n“Professor,” asked Watson, “is it the occult?”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” brightening; “now we are getting back to the old point. However,\r\nwhat is the occult?” He paused; then--“Did it ever occur to you, that\r\nthe occult might prove to be the real world, proving that life we have\r\nknown to be merely a shadow?”\r\n\r\nSilence greeted this. The professor went on:\r\n\r\n“Let me ask you: Are you living in a real world now, or an unreal one?”\r\n There was no response. “It is, of course, a reality; just as truly as if\r\nyou were in San Francisco. So,” very distinctly, “perhaps it is merely a\r\nquestion of viewpoint, as to which is the occult!”\r\n\r\n“Just what we want to know,” from Harry.\r\n\r\n“And that,” tossing up his hands, “is exactly what I cannot tell you.\r\nI have found out many things, but I cannot be sure. I left certainty in\r\nBerkeley.\r\n\r\n“Today I feel that there is some great fate, some unknown force that\r\ndefies analysis, defies all attempts at resolution--a force that is\r\ndriving me through the role of the Jarados. We are all a part of the\r\nProphecy!\r\n\r\n“We must wait for the last day for our answer. That Prophecy must and\r\nwill be fulfilled. And on that day we shall have the key to the Blind\r\nSpot--we shall know the where of the occult.”\r\n\r\nHe took a sip from a tumbler of the familiar green fluid.\r\n\r\n“Now that I have told you this much, I am going back to the beginning.\r\nI, too, have had adventures.\r\n\r\n“How did I come to discover the Blind Spot?\r\n\r\n“It was about one year prior to my last lecture at the university. At\r\nthe time I had been doing much psychic-research work, all of which you\r\nknow. And out of it I had adduced some peculiar theories. For example:\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly there is such a thing as a spirit world. If all the mediums\r\nbut one were dishonest, and that one produced the results that couldn't\r\nbe explained away by psychology, then we must admit the existence of\r\nanother world.\r\n\r\n“But reason tells us that there is nothing but reality; that if there\r\nwere a spirit world it must be just as real, just as substantial as\r\nour own. Moreover--somewhere, somehow, here must be a definite point of\r\ncontact!\r\n\r\n“That was approximately my theory. Of course I had no idea how close I\r\nhad come to a great truth. To some extent it was pure guesswork.\r\n\r\n“Then, one day Budge Kennedy brought me the blue stone. He told me its\r\nhistory, and he maintained that it was lighter than air, which of course\r\nI disbelieved until I took it out of the ring and saw for myself.\r\n\r\n“I went at once to the house at 288 Chatterton Place. There I found an\r\nold lady who had lived in the house for some time. I asked to see the\r\ncellar where the stone had been unearthed. Understand, I had no idea of\r\nthe great discovery I was about to make; I merely wanted to see. And I\r\nfound something almost as impossible as the blue stone itself-a\r\ngreen one, heavier than any known mineral, answering to no known\r\nclassification but of an entirely new element. It was no larger than a\r\npea, but of incredible weight.\r\n\r\n“Coming upstairs I found the old lady a bit perturbed. I had told her my\r\nname; she had recognised me as well.\r\n\r\n“'Come with me,' she said.\r\n\r\n“With that she opened a door. She was very old and very uncertain; yet\r\nshe was scarcely afraid.\r\n\r\n“'In there,” she said, and pointed through the door.\r\n\r\n“I entered an ordinary room, furnished as a parlour. There was a sofa, a\r\ntable, a few chairs; little else.\r\n\r\n“'What do you mean?' I asked.\r\n\r\n“'The man!'\r\n\r\n“'The man! What man?”\r\n\r\n“'Oh!' she exclaimed, 'he came here one night when the moon was shining.\r\nHe sat down on the doorstep. He was just the kind of a lad that's in\r\nneed of a mother. So I asked him to lie on the sofa. He was tired, you\r\nsee, and--I once had a son of my own.'\r\n\r\n“She stopped, and it was a moment before she continued. I could feel the\r\npressure of her hand on my arm, pitiful, beseeching.\r\n\r\n“'So I took him in there. In there; see? On that sofa. I saw it! They\r\ntook him! Oh, sir; it was terrible!'\r\n\r\n“She was weird, uncanny, strangely interesting.\r\n\r\n“'He just lay down there. I was standing by the door when--they took\r\nhim! I couldn't understand, sir. I saw the blue light; and the moon--it\r\nwas gone. And then--' She looked up at me again and whispered: 'And then\r\nI heard a bell--a very beautiful bell--a church bell, sir? But you know,\r\ndon't you? You are the great Dr. Holcomb. That's why you went into the\r\ncellar, wasn't it? Because you know!'\r\n\r\n“Her manner as much as her story, impressed me. I said:\r\n\r\n“'I must give this room a careful examination. Would you be good enough\r\nto leave me to myself?'\r\n\r\n“She closed the door after her. I had the green stone in my hand; it was\r\nvery heavy, and I placed it on one of the chairs. The blue stone I\r\nstill held. At the moment I hadn't the least notion of what was about to\r\nhappen; it was all accident, from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n“All of a sudden the room disappeared! That is, the side wall; I was not\r\nlooking at the dingy old wallpaper, but out through and into an immense\r\nbuilding, dim, vast and immeasurable.\r\n\r\n“Directly in front of me was a white substance like a stone of snow.\r\nUpon this substance was seated a man, about my own age, as nearly as I\r\ncould make out. He looked up just as I noted him.\r\n\r\n“Our recognition was mutual. Immediately he made a sign with one hand.\r\nAnd at once I took a step forward; I thought he had motioned. It was all\r\nso real and natural. Though his features were dim he could not have been\r\nmore than ten feet distant. But, at that very instant, when I made that\r\none step, the whole thing vanished.\r\n\r\n“I was still in the room at Chatterton Place!\r\n\r\n“That's what started it all. Had this occurred to any one else in the\r\nworld I should have labelled it an unaccountable illusion. But it had\r\nhappened to me.\r\n\r\n“I had my theory; between the spiritual and the material there must be a\r\npoint of contact. And--I had found it! I had discovered the road to\r\nthe Indies, to the Occult, to all that other men call unknowable. And I\r\ncalled it--\r\n\r\n“The Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\n\r\nTHE ARADNA\r\n\r\n\r\nThus had the professor got into actual touch with the occult--by sheer\r\naccident. Up to that time it had been only a hypothesis; now it was a\r\nfact. Next step was to open up direct communication.\r\n\r\n“That was difficult. To begin with, I worked to repeat the phenomena\r\nI had seen, getting some haphazard results from the start. My purpose\r\nthroughout was to exchange intelligent comment with the individual I had\r\nbeheld on that snow-stone within the Spot; and in the end I succeeded.\r\n\r\n“He gave me fairly explicit warning as to when the Blind Spot should\r\nopen, not only to the eye, but in its entirety, as it had done for the\r\nyoung man of whom the old lady had told me. We agreed through signs that\r\nhe would come through first.\r\n\r\n“Understand, up to the instant of his actual arrival, I didn't know just\r\nwhat he was like. I had to be content with his sign-talk, by which he\r\nassured me he was a real man, material, of life and the living.\r\n\r\n“I made my announcement. You know most of what followed. The Rhamda\r\ncame to Berkeley; together we returned to Chatterton Place, for it\r\nwas imperative that we hold the Spot open or at least maintain the\r\nphenomenon at such a point that we could reopen it at will. Both of us\r\nwere guessing.\r\n\r\n“Neither of us knew, at the time, just how long the Rhamda could endure\r\nour atmosphere. He had risked his life to come through; it was no more\r\nthan fair that I should accede to his caution and insure him a safe\r\nreturn to his own world.\r\n\r\n“But things went wrong. It was ignorance as much as accident. At\r\nChatterton Place I was caught in the Blind Spot, and without a particle\r\nof preparation was tossed into the Thomahlia.\r\n\r\n“When I came through, the Nervina went out. Thus I found myself in this\r\nstrange place with no one to guide me. And unfortunately, or rather,\r\nfortunately, I fell into the hands of the Bar Senestro.\r\n\r\n“Now, for all that he is a sceptic, the Senestro is a brave man; and\r\nlike many another unbeliever, he has a sense of humour. My coming had\r\nbeen promised by Avec; so he knew that somehow I was a part of the\r\nProphecy--the prophecy which, for reasons of his own, he did not want\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n“So he isolated me here in the house of the Jarados. A bold sort of\r\nhumor, I call it--to defy the Prophecy in the very spot where it was\r\nwritten!\r\n\r\n“But it was fortunate. I was in the house of the old prophet, with its\r\nstores of wisdom, secrets, raw elements and means for applying the laws\r\nof nature. All that I hitherto had only guessed at, I now had at my\r\ndisposal: libraries, laboratories, everything. I was a recluse with no\r\ninterruptions and perfect facility for study.\r\n\r\n“First of all I went into their philosophy. Then into their science,\r\nand afterwards into their history. Whereupon I made a rather startling\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n“Apparently I AM THE JARADOS.\r\n\r\n“For my coming had been foretold almost to the hour. As I went on with\r\nthe research I found many other points that seemed familiar. Plainly\r\nthere was something that had led me into the Spot; and most certainly it\r\nwas not mere chance. I became convinced that not merely my own destiny,\r\nbut a higher, a transcendental fate was at stake.\r\n\r\n“In the course of time I became certain of this. Meanwhile I mastered\r\nmost of the secrets of this palace--the wisdom of the ancient Jarados.\r\nThough a prisoner, I was the happiest of men--which I still remain. The\r\nBars kept close watch over me, constantly changing their guard. And it\r\nwas on one of those occasions that I found MacPherson.\r\n\r\n“Well, after MacPherson's coming I was pretty much my own master.\r\nI induced the Senestro to allow MacPherson to remain as a constant\r\nbodyguard. But I never told Pat what was what, except that some day we\r\nshould extricate ourselves.\r\n\r\n“You may wonder why I did not open the Spot.\r\n\r\n“There were several reasons: First, in the nature of the phenomenon it\r\nmust be opened only on the earth side, except on rare occasions when\r\ncertain conditions are peculiarly favourable. That's why the Rhamda Avec\r\ncould not do it alone; I know now that I should have imparted to him\r\ncertain technicalities. I possessed two of the keys then; now, I know\r\nthere are three.\r\n\r\n“And I have learned that each of these is a sinister thing.\r\n\r\n“The blue stone, for instance, is life, and it is male. Rather a\r\nsweeping and ambiguous statement; but you will comprehend it in the end.\r\nWere a man to wear it it would kill him, in time; but a woman can wear\r\nit with impunity.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will appreciate that statement better if you note what I\r\nhave just done through the medium of that crystal. The blue gem is an\r\ninductor of the ether; in a sense, it is one of the anchors of the Spot\r\nof Life, or the Blind Spot--whatever we want to call it--the Spot of\r\nContact.\r\n\r\n“The other two particles--the red and the green one--are respectively\r\nthe Soul and the Material. Or, let us say, the etheric embryos of these\r\nessentials.\r\n\r\n“The three stones constitute an eternal trinity.\r\n\r\n“As for the substance of the Spot itself, that I cannot tell, just yet.\r\nBut I do know that the whole truth will come out clear in the fulfilment\r\nof the Prophecy. I am convinced that it has translated Watson, and now\r\nHarry Wendel and the Nervina.”\r\n\r\n“Can you control it?” asked Chick.\r\n\r\n“To a limited extent. I have been able to watch you ever since your\r\ncoming. You did not know about Harry, but I saw him come--in the arms of\r\nthe Nervina.”\r\n\r\nThe Nervina nodded.\r\n\r\n“It is so. I knew the Senestro. I was afraid that Harry would fall into\r\nhis hands. I had previously endeavoured to have him give the jewel to\r\nCharlotte Fenton. I didn't trust the great Bar--”\r\n\r\nHarry interrupted, “Only because of her distrust of the Senestro did she\r\ndecide to come through the Blind Spot with me. She knew what to do. As\r\nsoon as we got here, she bundled me off, privately nursed me back to\r\nhealth if not strength, and when the time came rushed me up here at the\r\nlast second to be in at the finish.”\r\n\r\nWatson thought of the dog, Queen. She also had come through just in time\r\nto save his life. Did Harry know anything about her? When Wendel had\r\nrelated what he knew, Chick commented:\r\n\r\n“It's almighty strange, Harry. Everything works out to fit in exactly\r\nwith that confounded Prophecy. Perhaps that accounts for your affinity\r\nfor the Nervina; it is something beyond your control, or hers. We'll\r\nhave to wait and see.”\r\n\r\nThere was not long to wait. The days passed. The palace was full of\r\nRhamdas, summoned by Dr. Holcomb, who, as the Jarados himself, was now\r\nissuing orders concerning the great day, the last of the sixteen days,\r\nnow very close at hand; the day which the Rhamdas constantly alluded to\r\nas “the Day of Judgment.”\r\n\r\nThe Senestro went unmolested. Returning to the Mahovisal, he worked now\r\nto further the truths of the Prophecy.\r\n\r\nStill the millions continued to descend upon the Mahovisal. Coming from\r\nthe furthermost parts of the Thomahlia, the pilgrims' aircraft kept the\r\nair above the city constantly alive. There were days such as no man had\r\never known. Even the Rhamdas, trained to composure, gave evidence of the\r\nstrain. The atmosphere was tense, charged with expectancy and hope. A\r\nwhole world was coming to what it conceived as its judgment, and its\r\nend. And--the Spot of Life was the Blind Spot!\r\n\r\nAt last the doctor summoned the two young men. It was night, and the\r\nJune Bug was waiting. This time the Geos himself was at the controls.\r\n\r\n“We are going to the Mahovisal,” spoke the doctor--“to the Temple of\r\nthe Bell and Leaf. There is still something I must know before the\r\nJudgment.” He was speaking English. “If we can bring the Prophecy\r\nto pass just so far, and no farther, we shall be able to extricate\r\nourselves nicely. Anyway, I think we shall not return to the Palace of\r\nLight.”\r\n\r\nHe held a black leather case in his hand. He touched it with a finger.\r\n\r\n“If this little case and its contents get through the Blind Spot it\r\nwill advance civilisation--our civilisation--about a thousand-fold. So\r\nremember: Whatever happens to me, be sure and remember this case! It\r\nmust go through the Spot!”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but took his seat beside the Geos. The young men took\r\nthe rear seats. In a short time they had crossed the great range of\r\nmountains and were hovering over the Mahovisal.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound. Though the city was packed with untold millions, the\r\ntension was such that scarcely a murmur came out of the metropolis. The\r\nair was magnetic, charged, strained close to the breaking point; above\r\nall, the reverence for the Last Day, and the hope, rising, accumulating,\r\nto the final supreme moment.\r\n\r\nFor the Sixteenth Day was now only forty-eight hours removed.\r\n\r\nBoth Chick and Harry realised that their lives were at stake; the doctor\r\nhad made that clear. In the last minute, in the final crisis, they must\r\ncrowd their way through the Blind Spot. Only the professor knew how it\r\nwas to be done.\r\n\r\nAt the temple they found the Nervina and the Aradna waiting. The Jan\r\nLucar was with them. The Geos had secured entrance by a side door. From\r\nit they could look out, themselves unobserved, over the entire building\r\nand upon the Spot of Life. The place was packed--thousands upon\r\nthousands of people, standing in silent awe and worship, one and all\r\ngazing toward the all-important Spot. There was no sound save the\r\nwhisper of multitudinous breathing.\r\n\r\nSaid Harry to Chick:\r\n\r\n“I see Queen up there!”\r\n\r\nHarry circled the group, and bounded up the great stairs. In a moment\r\nhe was patting his dog's head. She looked up and wagged her tail to show\r\nher pleasure. But she was not effusive. Somehow she wasn't just like his\r\nold shepherd. She glanced at him, and then out at the concourse below,\r\nand lolled her tongue expectantly. Then she settled back into her place\r\nand resumed watch--exactly as any of her kind would have held guard over\r\na band of sheep.\r\n\r\nThe dog was serious. Afterward, Wendel said he had a dim notion that she\r\nwas no longer a dog at all, but a mere instrument in the hand of Fate.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter, old girl?” he asked. “Don't you like 'em?”\r\n\r\nFor answer she gave a low whine. She looked up again, and out into the\r\nthrong; she repeated the whine, with a little whimper at the end.\r\n\r\nHarry returned to the others. Nothing was said of what he had done. At\r\nonce the Geos led the group through a small, half-hidden door, beyond\r\nwhich was a narrow, winding stairway of chocolate-coloured stone. The\r\nGeos halted.\r\n\r\n“Dost wish the building emptied, O Jarados?”\r\n\r\n“I do. When we come back from under the Spot of Life, we should have the\r\nplace to ourselves.”\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the two queens the Rhamda returned to the main body of\r\nthe temple. Dr. Holcomb, Harry and Chick were left to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe professor took out a notebook. In it was traced a map, or chart,\r\ntogether with several notations.\r\n\r\n“The three of us,” said he, “are going to take a look at the under side\r\nof the Blind Spot. This stairway leads into a secret chamber inside the\r\nfoundations of the great stair; and according to this data I found in\r\nthe palace, together with some calculations of my own, we ought to find\r\nsome of the secrets of the Spot.”\r\n\r\nHe led the way up the steps. At the top of the flight they came to a\r\nblank, blue wall. There was no sign of a door, but in the front of the\r\nwall stood a low platform, in the centre of which was set a strange, red\r\nstone. The professor consulted his chart, then opened his black case.\r\nFrom it he took another stone, red like the other, but not so intense.\r\nThis he touched to the first, and waited.\r\n\r\nInside a minute a light sprang up from the contact. Immediately Harry\r\nand Chick beheld something they had not seen on the wall--a knob, or\r\nbutton. The doctor pulled sharply on it. Instantly a door opened in the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThey passed into another room. It was not a large place--about thirty\r\nfeet across, perhaps, stone-walled and with a low ceiling. From all\r\nsides a soft, intrinsic glow was given off. There were no furnishings.\r\n\r\nBut in the centre of the ceiling, occupying almost all the space\r\noverhead, a snow-white substance hung as if suspended. Were it not\r\nfor its colour and its size, it might have been likened to an immense,\r\nhorizontal grindstone hung in mid-air, with apparently nothing to hold\r\nit there. Around its side they could make out a narrow gap between\r\nit and the ceiling. And directly along its lower edge was a series of\r\nsmall, fiery jewels inset, and of the order and colour of the sign of\r\nthe Jarados--red, blue and green, alternating.\r\n\r\nThe professor produced an electric torch and held it up to show that the\r\ngap between the stone and the ceiling was unbroken at any point. Then he\r\ncounted the jewels on the lower edge. Chick made out twenty-four. Three\r\nwere missing from their sockets--all told, then, there should have been\r\ntwenty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe doctor noted the positions of the three empty sockets and, drawing\r\na tapeline from his pocket, proceeded to measure the distances from each\r\nof the three--they were widely separated round the circle--from each\r\nother. Then he turned to Chick and Harry.\r\n\r\n“Do you know where we are?”\r\n\r\n“Under the Spot of Life,” it was easy to answer.\r\n\r\n“You are in San Francisco!”\r\n\r\n“Not in--in--” Chick hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Exactly. This is 288 Chatterton Place--the house of the Blind\r\nSpot.” He paused for them to digest this. Then, “Harry--did you say\r\nHobart Fenton was with you on that last night?”\r\n\r\n“Hobart and his sister, Charlotte. I remember their coming at the last\r\nminute. They were too late, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe professor nodded.\r\n\r\n“Well, Harry, the chances are that Hobart is not more than twenty\r\nfeet away at the present moment. Charlotte may be sitting right\r\nthere”--pointing to a spot at Harry's side--“this very instant. And\r\nthere may be many others.\r\n\r\n“No doubt they are working hard to solve the mystery. Unfortunately the\r\nbest they can do is to guess. We hold the key. That is--I should correct\r\nthat statement--we hold the knowledge, and they hold the keys.”\r\n\r\n“The keys?” Harry wanted to know more.\r\n\r\nThe professor pointed to the three empty sockets in the great white\r\nstone above their heads. “These three missing stones are the keys.\r\nUntil they are reset we cannot control the Spot. I had found two of\r\nthem before I came through. I take it that both of you remember the blue\r\none?”\r\n\r\n“I think,” agreed Chick, “that neither of us is ever likely to forget\r\nit! Eh, Harry?”\r\n\r\nThe professor smiled. He was holding the light up to the snow-stone,\r\nat a spot that would have been the point of intersection had lines been\r\ndrawn from the three missing gems, and the resulting triangle centred.\r\nHe held his hand up to the substance. It was slightly rough at that\r\npoint, as though it had been frozen.\r\n\r\nThen he ran his fingers across the surrounding surface.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he exclaimed. “I thought so! That helps considerably. Chick--put\r\nyour hand up here. What do you feel?”\r\n\r\n“Rough,” said Chick, feeling the intersection point. “Slightly so, but\r\ncold and--and magnetic.”\r\n\r\n“Now feel here.”\r\n\r\n“Cool and magnetic, doctor; but smooth. What does it prove?”\r\n\r\n“Let's see; do you understand the term 'electrolysis'? Good. Well,\r\nthere should be another clue--not similar, but supplementary, or rather,\r\ncomplementary--on the earth side. Perhaps one of you found it while you\r\nlived in that house.” The professor eyed both men anxiously. “Did either\r\nof you find a stain, or anything of that sort, on the walls, ceiling, or\r\nfloor of any room there?”\r\n\r\nBoth shook their heads.\r\n\r\n“Well, there ought to be,” frowned the doctor. “I am positive that,\r\nshould we return now, we could locate some such phenomenon. From this\r\nside it is very easy to account for; it's simply the disintegrating\r\neffect of the current, constantly impinging at the point of contact or\r\nthe intersection. Having acted on this side, it must have left some mark\r\non the other.”\r\n\r\nWatson was still running his hand over the snow-stone. Once before, when\r\nhe had stood barefooted in the contest with the Senestro, he had noted\r\nits cold magnetism.\r\n\r\n“What is this substance, professor?”\r\n\r\n“That, I have not been able to discover. I would call it neutral\r\nelement, for want of a more exact term; something that touches both\r\naspects of the spectrum.”\r\n\r\n“Both aspects of the spectrum?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; as nearly as the limitations of my vocabulary will permit. If you\r\nrecall, I showed you a simple experiment the other day in the palace.\r\nBy means of an inductor I drew out the iron principle from the ether and\r\nbuilt up the metal. Only it was not precisely iron but its Thomahlian\r\nequivalent. Had you been on the earth side you would have seen nothing\r\nat all, not even myself. I was on the wrong aspect of the spectrum.\r\n\r\n“Also, you see here the Jaradic colours--the crimson, green and\r\nblue--the shades between, the iridescence and the shadows. Had you\r\nbeen on the other side you wouldn't have seen one of them; they are not\r\nprecisely our own colours, but their equivalents on this side of the\r\nSpot.\r\n\r\n“In the final analysis, as I said before, it gets down to ether, to\r\nspeed and vibration--and still at last to the perceptive limitations of\r\nour own earthly five senses. Just stop and consider how limited we are!\r\nOnly five senses--why, even insects have six. Then consider that all\r\nmatter, when we get to the bottom of it, is differentiated and condensed\r\nether, focused into various mathematical arrangements, as numberless as\r\nthe particles of the universe. Of these our five senses pick out a very\r\nsmall proportion indeed.\r\n\r\n“This is one way to account for the Blind Spot. It may be merely\r\nanother phase of the spectrum--not simply the unexplored regions of the\r\ninfra-red or the ultra-violet, but a region co-existent with what we\r\nnormally apprehend, and making itself manifest through apertures in what\r\nwe, with our extremely limited sense-grasp, think to be a continuous\r\nspectrum. I throw out the idea mainly as a suggestion. It is not\r\nnecessarily the true explanation.\r\n\r\n“Let us go a bit farther. Remember, we are still upon the earth. And\r\nthat we are still in San Francisco, although all the while we are also\r\nin the Mahovisal. This is 288 Chatterton Place, and at the same time\r\nit is the Temple of the Bell. It might be a hundred or a thousand other\r\nplaces just as well, too, if my hypothesis is correct; which we shall\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n“Now, what does this mean? Simply this, gentlemen, that we five-sensed\r\npeople have failed to grasp the true meaning of the word 'Infinity.' We\r\nlook out toward the stars, fancying that only in unlimited space can we\r\nfind the infinite. We little suspect we ourselves are infinity! It is\r\nonly our five senses that make us finite.\r\n\r\n“As soon as we grasp this the so-called spiritual realm becomes a very\r\nsubstantial fact. We begin to apprehend the occult. Our five-sensed\r\nworld is merely a highly specialized phase of infinity. Material or\r\nspiritual--it is all the same. That's why we look on the Thomahlians as\r\noccult, and why they consider us in the same light.\r\n\r\n“It is strictly a question of sense perception and limitations, which\r\ncan be covered by the word, 'viewpoint.' Viewpoint--that is all it\r\namounts to.\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing as unreality; but there is most certainly such a\r\nthing as relativity, and all life is real.\r\n\r\n“Of course I knew nothing of this until the discovery of the Blind Spot.\r\nIt will, I think, prove to be one of the greatest events in history. It\r\nwill silence the sceptics, and form a bulwark for all religion. And it\r\nwill make us all appreciate our Creator the more.”\r\n\r\nThe professor stopped. For some moments there was silence.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do now?” asked Harry.\r\n\r\nBut the professor chose not to answer. With his tape he began taking a\r\nfresh series of measurements, with reference to the empty sockets and\r\none particularly brilliant red gem, which seemed to be “number one” in\r\nthe circle. From time to time the doctor jotted down the results and\r\nmade short calculations. Presently he said: “That ought to be enough.\r\nNow suppose we--”\r\n\r\nAt that instant something happened. Harry Wendel caught him by the\r\nshoulder. He pointed to the suspended stone.\r\n\r\nIt was moving!\r\n\r\nIt was revolving, almost imperceptibly, like some vast wheel turning\r\non its axis. So slowly did it rotate, the motion would have escaped\r\nattention were it not for the gems and their brilliance.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it came to a stop, short and quick, as though it had dropped\r\ninto a notch. And from above they heard the deep, solemn clang of the\r\ntemple bell.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Harry, startled. “Who moved the stone?”\r\n\r\n“Can it be,” flashed Chick, “that Hobart Fenton has found the keys?”\r\n\r\n“That remains to be seen!” from the doctor. “Come--we must find out what\r\nhas happened!”\r\n\r\nWithin a minute they knew. As they came out of the private door on the\r\nnow emptied floor of the great temple, they saw the senior queen, the\r\nNervina, coming down the great stairway from the Spot of Life.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” called Harry, apprehensively.\r\n\r\n“The Aradna!” she replied. Her voice was curiously strained. “Something\r\nhappened, and--she has fallen through the Spot!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\n\r\nOUT OF THE OCCULT\r\n\r\n\r\n“HOW DID IT HAPPEN?”\r\n\r\n“I scarcely know. We went up to play with the dog. It was unwilling to\r\nleave the place, and Aradna teasingly tried to push her off on to the\r\nsteps. She succeeded, but--well, it was all over that quick. The Aradna\r\nwas gone!”\r\n\r\nBut the Spot had by this time lost a good deal of its terror. Knowing\r\nwhat was on the other side, and who, made a great difference. As the\r\ndoctor said later in a private consultation with Chick and Harry:\r\n\r\n“It's not so bad. That is, if Hobart Fenton is at work there. I think\r\nhe is. Really, I only regret that we didn't know of this beforehand; we\r\ncould have sent a message through to him.”\r\n\r\nAnd the professor went on to explain what he meant. At the time he\r\nspoke, it was twenty-four hours after the Aradna's going; another\r\ntwenty-four hours would see the evening of the Last Day--the sixteenth\r\nof the sacred Days of Life--what the Rhamdas alluded to as “the Day of\r\nJudgment.” And the Mahovisal was a seething mass of humanity, all bent\r\nupon seeing the fulfillment of their highest hopes.\r\n\r\n“Bear in mind that if the Spot should not open at the last moment, you\r\nand I are done for. We will be self-condemned 'False Ones'; our lives\r\nwill not last one minute after midnight tomorrow night if we fail to get\r\nthrough!\r\n\r\n“That Prophecy means EVERYTHING to the Thomahlians. There was a time\r\nwhen they accepted it on faith; now it is an intellectual conviction\r\nwith every last one of them. And one and all look forward to a new and\r\nglorious life beyond the Spot--in the occult world--our world!\r\n\r\n“Now, the ticklish part of the job will be to open the Spot just long\r\nenough to permit us to get through, yet prevent the whole Prophecy from\r\ncoming to pass. We've got to get through, together with that black case\r\nof mine, and then shut the door in the face of all Thomahlia!”\r\n\r\nNothing more was said on the subject until late the following afternoon,\r\nas the doctor, Harry, and Chick sat down to a light meal. They ate much\r\nas if nothing whatever was in the wind. From where they sat, in one part\r\nof a wing of the temple, they could look out into the crowded streets,\r\nin which were packed untold numbers of pilgrims, all pressing towards\r\nthe great square plaza in front of the temple. No guards were to be\r\nseen; the solemnity of the occasion was sufficient to keep order. But\r\nthe terrific potentiality of that semi-fanatical host did not cause the\r\ndoctor's voice to change one iota.\r\n\r\n“There is no telling what may happen,” he said. “For my own part I shall\r\nnot venture near the Spot of Life until just at the end. I shall remain\r\nin the chamber underneath.\r\n\r\n“But you two ought to show yourselves immediately after sundown. Certain\r\nancient writings indicate it. You, and the Nervina, will have to mount\r\nthe stair to the Spot, and remain in sight until midnight--until the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n“So we must be prepared for accidents.” He took some papers from his\r\npocket, and selected two, and gave one to each of his pupils. “Here are\r\nthe details of what must be done. In case only one of us gets through,\r\nit will be enough.”\r\n\r\n“But--how can these be of any use, on such short notice?” Harry asked.\r\n\r\n“Cudgel your brains a bit, gentlemen,” he chided good-humouredly. “You\r\nwill soon see my drift. This is one of those occasions when the psychic\r\nelements involved are such that, without doubt, it were best if you\r\nreacted naturally to whatever may happen.\r\n\r\n“Now you will note that I have made a drawing of the Blind Spot region;\r\nalso certain calculations which will explain themselves.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, I have written out the combination to my laboratory safe in\r\nmy house in Berkeley. The green stone is there. Bertha will help, as\r\nsoon as she understands that it is my wish; no explanation will be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n“You may leave the rest to me, young gentlemen. Act as through you\r\nhad no notion that I was down below the Spot. I shall be merely\r\nexperimenting a bit with that circle of jewels, to see if the phenomena\r\nwhich affected the Aradna cannot be repeated. I fancy it was not mere\r\naccident, but rather the working of a 'period.'”\r\n\r\nHe said no more about this, except to comment that he hoped to get into\r\ndirect communication with Hobart Fenton before midnight should arrive.\r\nHowever, he did say, in an irrelevant sort of manner:\r\n\r\n“Oh, by the way--do either of you happen to recall which direction the\r\nhouse at Chatterton Place faces?”\r\n\r\n“North,” replied Harry and Chick, almost in the same breath.\r\n\r\n“Ah yes. Well, the temple faces south. Can you remember that?”\r\n\r\nThey thought they could. The rest of the meal was eaten without any\r\ndiscussion. Just as they arose, however, the doctor observed:\r\n\r\n“It may be that Hobart Fenton has got to come through. I wish I\r\nknew more about his mentality; it's largely a question of psychic\r\ninfluence--the combined, resultant force of the three material gems, and\r\nthe three degrees of psychic vibration as put forth by him and you two.\r\nWe shall see.\r\n\r\n“Something happened today--the Geos told me about it--which may link up\r\nHobart very definitely. It was about one o'clock when one of the temple\r\npheasants began to behave very queerly up on the great stair. It had\r\nbeen walking around on the snow-stone, and flying a bit; then it started\r\nto hop down the steps.\r\n\r\n“About sixteen steps down, Geos says the pheasant stopped and began\r\nto flutter frantically, as though some unseen person were holding it.\r\nSuddenly it vanished, and as suddenly reappeared again. It flew off,\r\nunharmed. I can't quite account for it, but--well, we'll see!”\r\n\r\nHe spoke no more, but led the way out into the entrance to the wing.\r\nThere they waited only a moment or two, before the Nervina and her\r\nretinue arrived. Without delay a start was made for the great black\r\nstairway.\r\n\r\nThe doctor alone remained behind.\r\n\r\nThere was a guard-lined lane through the crowd, allowing the Nervina and\r\nthe rest access to the foot of the steps. Reaching that point she paused\r\nfor a look around.\r\n\r\nThe sun had just gone down; the artificial lights of the temple had not\r\nyet been turned on. Overhead, the great storm-cloud hung portentously,\r\neven more ominous than in the brighter light. The huge waterspout\r\ncolumns, the terrific size of the auditorium, were none the less\r\nimpressive for the incalculable horde that filled every bit of floor\r\nspace. At the front of the building the archway gave a glimpse of the\r\nvastly greater throng waiting outside.\r\n\r\nBut all was quiet, with the silence of reverence and supreme\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nThe long flight of stairs was lined on either side, from bottom to\r\ntop, with the Rhamdas. On the landing there stood only two of the three\r\nchairs that Chick had seen on the previous occasion. The green one had\r\nbeen brought down and placed in the centre of an open spot just at the\r\nfoot of the stairs.\r\n\r\nIn this chair sat the Bar Senestro. Deployed about him, at a respectful\r\ndistance, was a semi-circle of the Bars, many hundreds in number. Behind\r\nthe Bars, separating them from the crowds at their backs, were grouped\r\nthe crimson and blue guardsmen. Among them, no doubt, were the Jan Lucar\r\nand the MacPherson, but Chick could locate neither.\r\n\r\nThe Nervina, taking Harry's arm, ascended the steps. Chick followed,\r\nwith the Rhamda Geos at his side. At the top of the flight the Nervina\r\nwas escorted to one of the chairs, while Chick placed the Geos in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt left the two Californians on their feet, to move around to whatever\r\nextent seemed commensurate with dignity. Chick drew Harry aside.\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose,” said Chick, indicating the handsome, confident\r\nfigure in the chair at the base of the stairs--“what do you suppose\r\nfriend Senestro is thinking about?”\r\n\r\nHarry frowned. “You know him better than I do. You don't think he has\r\nreformed?”\r\n\r\n“Not on your life; not the Bar. He's merely adjusted his plans to the\r\nnew situation. He sees that the Prophecy is likely to be fulfilled; so,\r\nhe counts on being the first to get through, after the Nervina. Then,\r\nwhether the rest of the Thomahlia follows or not--he calls himself the\r\ndivinely appointed leader now, I understand--he will get through and\r\nmarry the two Queens anyhow!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because the crowd was so terrifically large. Or, there\r\nmay have been something in the destiny of things that would not permit\r\nthe chief actors to feel nervous. Certain it is that neither of the two\r\nmen experienced the least stage fright. Had they been on display before\r\na crowd one-tenth the size, anywhere else, both would have been ill at\r\nease. This was different--enormously so.\r\n\r\nNo longer was there any circulation in the crowd. People remained in\r\ntheir places now, just as they expected the end to find them. Chick\r\nand Harry marvelled at their composure, strangely in contrast with\r\nthe ceaseless activities of the temple pheasants darting everywhere\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Harry remarked:\r\n\r\n“I've got an idea, Chick! It's this: How does the professor expect to\r\nsend a message to Hobart?” Chick could not guess.\r\n\r\nBut already Harry had taken his sheet of instructions from his pocket,\r\nand was rolling it into a compact pellet. Then he went to Queen, and\r\nwith a ribbon borrowed from the Nervina, tied the message tightly to the\r\ndog's collar.\r\n\r\n“Hobart will be certain to see it,” said he. “I wonder if the doctor's\r\nfigured it out yet?”\r\n\r\n“He's playing with a tremendous force,” observed Chick, thoughtfully.\r\nHe reached out and touched the snow-stone with his foot, just as he had\r\ndone before, and fancied that he could feel that electric thrill even\r\nthrough the leather of his shoes. “Still, it's worth any risk he may\r\nbe taking down in that chamber. If only he could send Queen through!\r\nHobart--”\r\n\r\nHe never finished the sentence. He staggered, thrown off his balance by\r\nreason of the fact that he had been resting the weight of one foot on\r\nthe stone and--it moved!\r\n\r\nMoved--shifted about its axis, just as it had done forty-eight hours\r\npreviously, when the Aradna had dropped through.\r\n\r\nAnd Chick had only a flash of a second for a glimpse of the startled\r\nfaces of Harry, the Nervina and the Geos, the huge multitude below the\r\nstair, Queen on the other side, and the fateful Prophecy on the walls\r\nabove him, before--\r\n\r\nA figure came into existence at his side. It was that of a powerfully\r\nbuilt man, on whose wrists were curious red circles. And Chick shouted\r\nin a great voice:\r\n\r\n“Hobart!”\r\n\r\nAnd then came blackness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\n\r\nTHE LAST LEAF\r\n\r\n\r\nWatson's story was now completed. During the entire recital his auditors\r\nhad spoken scarcely a word. It had been marvellous--almost a revelation.\r\nWith the possible exception of Sir Henry Hodges, not one had expected\r\nthat it would measure up to this. For the whole thing backed up\r\nHolcomb's original proposition:\r\n\r\n“The Occult is concrete.”\r\n\r\nCertainly, if what Watson had told them was true, then Infinity had been\r\nsquared by itself. Not only was there an infinity that we might look up\r\nto through the stars, but there was another just as great, co-existent,\r\nhere upon the earth. The occult became not only possible, but unlimited.\r\n\r\nThe next few minutes would prove whether or not he had told the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was now close to midnight.\r\n\r\nJerome and General Hume had returned from Berkeley. Their quest had been\r\nsuccessful; Watson now had the missing green stone. A number of soldiers\r\nwere stationed about the house. Watson noted these men when he had\r\nfinished his account, and said:\r\n\r\n“Good. We may need them, although I hope not. Fortunately the Spot is\r\nsmall, and a few of us can hold it against a good many. What we must do\r\nis to extricate our friends and close it. Afterward we may have time for\r\nmore leisurely investigation. But we must remember, above all things,\r\nthat black case of Professor Holcomb's! It holds the secrets.\r\n\r\n“Now I must ask you all to step out of this room. This library, you\r\nknow, is the Blind Spot.”\r\n\r\nHe directed them to take positions along the balustrade of the stairway,\r\nout in the hall--through the wide archway, where they could have a clear\r\nview, yet be safe.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious test. With nothing but his mathematics and his drawing\r\nto go by, Watson was about to set the three stones in their invisible\r\nsockets. He spread the map out carefully, likewise his calculations;\r\nthey gave him, on this floor, the precise positions that he charted\r\non the earth of the cellar. A glance toward the front of the\r\nhouse--north--then a little measuring, three chalk-marks on the carpet,\r\nand he was ready for the final move.\r\n\r\nHe took the fateful ring and with a penknife pried up the prongs that\r\nheld the stone. As it popped out he caught it with one hand. Then he\r\nlooked at the row of wondering faces along the stair.\r\n\r\n“I think it will work,” he said. “But, remember--don't come near! I\r\nshall get out as best I can myself; don't try to save me.”\r\n\r\nWith that he held the jewel on the first of the three chalk-marks on the\r\ncircumference of the great circle. He held it tight against the carpet\r\nand then let go. Up it flashed about one foot--and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound. Next Watson took the red stone. With it, the process\r\nwas inverted. Instead of holding it to the floor he raised it as high as\r\nhe could reach, directly above the second mark. Then he let it drop.\r\n\r\nIt did not reach the floor. It fell a little more than halfway, and\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe third stone, the green one, was still remaining. Watson took it to\r\nthe third and final mark on the circle, taking care to keep outside the\r\ncircumference that marked the Spot. This mark was directly in front of\r\nthe archway. He turned to them.\r\n\r\n“Watch carefully,” he spoke. “I do not know what has transpired in the\r\ntemple during the past few hours. Be ready for ANYTHING. All of you!”\r\n\r\nHe dropped the stone.\r\n\r\nWith the same motion he dodged out into the hall.\r\n\r\nThough there was no sound there was something that every one felt--a\r\nsibilant undertone and cold vibration--a tense flash of magnetism. Then\r\nthe dot of blue--a string of incandescence; just as had been spoken.\r\n\r\nThe Blind Spot was opening.\r\n\r\nWatson silently warned the others to remain where they were and\r\nhimself crowded back against the stair. And as he did so, someone came\r\nnoiselessly down the steps from the floor above, passed unnoticed behind\r\nthe watchers and thence across into the hall.\r\n\r\nIt was a slender, frail figure in white--the Aradna, walking like one in\r\nthe grip of a higher will. Before they could make a move she had stepped\r\ninto the Blind Spot, under the dot of blue, and into a string of light.\r\nAnd then--she was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was as swift as a guess. It was inexorable and unseen; and being\r\nunseen, close akin to terror. The group watched and waited, scarcely\r\nbreathing. What would happen next?\r\n\r\nThere came a sudden, jarring click--like the tapping of iron. And next\r\ninstant--\r\n\r\nThe Spot opened to human sight.\r\n\r\nThe library at 288 Chatterton Place was gone. Instead, the people on\r\nthe stairs were gazing down from the Spot of Life, straight into the\r\ncolossal Temple of the Jarados.\r\n\r\nIt was as Chick had described it--immense--beyond conception. Through\r\nthe great doors and out into the plaza beyond was gathered all\r\nThomahlia, reverent, like those waiting for the crack of doom.\r\n\r\nAbove the horde, high on the opposite wall, stood out the monster Clover\r\nLeaf of the Jarados; three-coloured--blazing like liquid fire; it was\r\nominous with real life.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the whole concourse rippled with commotion. Arms were\r\nuplifted; one and all pointed towards the dais. They, too were looking\r\nthrough the Spot. Then the multitude began to move.\r\n\r\nIt heaved and surged and rolled toward the centre. The guards were\r\npressed in upon the Bars, the Bars upon the Rhamda-lined stair. There\r\nwas no resisting that flood of humanity. On and up it came, sweeping\r\neverything before it.\r\n\r\nDirectly in the foreground lay the snow-stone. On its centre stood\r\nthe dog Queen, crouching, waiting, bristling. By her side Harry Wendel\r\ncrouched on one knee, as if awaiting the signal. Behind him, the\r\nNervina, supporting the awakening Aradna. And in front of all, the\r\npowerful bulk of Hobart Fenton, standing squarely at the head of the\r\nstair, ready to grapple the first to reach the landing.\r\n\r\nBut most important of all, there stood the doctor himself. He was at the\r\nNervina's side; in his hand, the case of priceless data. He was gazing\r\nthrough the Spot and making a signal of some kind to Watson, whereupon\r\nthe latter leaped to the edge of the unseen circle.\r\n\r\nSomething had gone wrong. The Spot was not fully open. Nothing but sight\r\ncould get through.\r\n\r\nYet there was no time for anything. Up the stairs came the Bars, leading\r\nand being pressed forward by the horde. At their head dashed the Bar\r\nSenestro, handsome as Alexander. Hobart stepped forward to meet him, but\r\nthe doctor stopped him with a word.\r\n\r\nOnly a few seconds elapsed between death and salvation. Again Dr.\r\nHolcomb signed to Watson; not a sound came through. Watson hesitated.\r\n\r\nThe dog Queen shot to her feet. Then the Senestro, out-distancing all\r\nthe rest and dodging Hobart, had leaped upon the dais.\r\n\r\nUpon the wall across the temple the great Leaf of the Jarados stood out\r\nlike sinister fire. It pulsed and vibrated--alive. The top petal--the\r\nblue one--suddenly broke into a seething wave of flame.\r\n\r\nStill Watson held back. He could not understand what Holcomb meant.\r\n\r\nQueen waited only until the Senestro set foot on the dais. She crouched,\r\nthen leaped.\r\n\r\nIt was done.\r\n\r\nWith a lightning shift of his nimble feet, the high-tempered Bar\r\nkicked the shepherd in the side. Caught at full leap, she was knocked\r\ncompletely over and fell upon the snow-stone.\r\n\r\nIt was the Sacrilege!\r\n\r\nEven the Bars beyond the Senestro stopped in horror. The Four-Footed\r\nOne--sacred to the Jarados--it was she who had been touched! Had the\r\nSenestro undone all on the Spot of Judgment, What would be the end?\r\n\r\nFenton acted. He caught the Senestro before he could get his balance and\r\nwith a mighty heave hurled him over the side of the stair. A second, and\r\nit was over.\r\n\r\nAnother second was the last. For the great Leaf of the Jarados had\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nThe green and red stood still; but out of the blue came a dazzling\r\nlight, a powerful beam; so brilliant, it seemed solid. It shot across\r\nthe whole sweep of the temple and touched the Prophecy. Over the golden\r\nscrolls it traced its marvellous colour, until it came to the lines:\r\n\r\n  Beware ye of sacrilege! Lest I take from ye all that I\r\n  have given ye, and the day be postponed--beware ye of\r\n  sacrilege!\r\n\r\nFor a moment the strange light stood still, so that the checked millions\r\nmight read. Then it turned upon the dais.\r\n\r\nThere it spread, and hovered over the group, until it seemed to work\r\nthem together--the Nervina to Harry, the Aradna to Hobart. Not one of\r\nthem knew what it was; they obeyed by impulse--it was their destiny; the\r\nChosen, and the queens.\r\n\r\nThe light stopped at the foot of Dr. Holcomb. Then the strangest thing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nOut of the light--or rather, from where it bathed the snowstone--came a\r\nman; a man much like Holcomb, bearded and short and kindly.\r\n\r\nHe was the real Jarados!\r\n\r\nUnhesitatingly the professor stepped up beside him. Then followed Hobart\r\nand the Aradna, Harry and the Nervina, and lastly, from the crowd of\r\nBars, MacPherson. The whole concourse in the temple stopped in awe and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nOnly for a second. Then the Jarados and all at his side--were gone.\r\n\r\nAnd upon the snow-stone there stood a sword of living flame.\r\n\r\nIt stood there for just a breath, exactly where the group had been.\r\n\r\nAnd it was gone.\r\n\r\nThat was all.\r\n\r\nNo; not quite all. For when the Blind Spot closed that night at 288\r\nChatterton Place, there came once more the deep, solemn peal of the Bell\r\nof the Jarados.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNACCOUNTABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWere this account merely a work of fiction, it would harmonise things so\r\nas to have no unaccountables in it. As it is, the present writers will\r\nhave to make this quite clear:\r\n\r\nIt is not known why the Rhamda Avec failed to show himself at the\r\ncrucial moment. Perhaps he could have changed everything. We can only\r\nsurmise; he has not been seen or heard from since.\r\n\r\nWhich also is true of Mr. Chick Watson. He disappeared immediately after\r\nthe closing of the Spot, saying that he was going to Bertha Holcomb's\r\nhome. No trace has been found of either to date. Doubtless the reader\r\nhas noted advertisement in the papers, appealing to the authorities to\r\nreport any one of Watson's description applying for a marriage licence.\r\n\r\nAs for his two friends, Wendel and Fenton, together with the Aradna and\r\nthe Nervina, they and MacPherson and the doctor absolutely vanished from\r\nall the knowledge, either of the Thomahlia or the earth. The Jarados\r\nalone can tell of them.\r\n\r\nMme. Le Fabre, however, feels that she can explain the matter\r\nsatisfactorily. Abridged, her theory runs:\r\n\r\n“There is but one way to explore the Occult. That way is to die.\r\n\r\n“For all that we were so strongly impressed with the reality of\r\nMr. Watson, I am firmly convinced that he was simply a spirit; that\r\neverything we saw was spirit manifestation.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Holcomb and all the rest have simply gone on to another plane. We\r\nshall never see them again. They are dead; no other explanation will\r\nhold. They are spirits.”\r\n\r\nGiving this version to the public strictly for what it is worth, the\r\npresent writers feel it only right to submit the conclusions reached\r\nby Dr. Malloy and concurred in by Drs. Higgins and Hansen, also, with\r\nreservations, by Professor Herold and by Miss Clarke.\r\n\r\n“To a certain extent, and up to a certain point, it is possible\r\nto account for the astonishing case of the Blind Spot by means of\r\nwell-known psychological principles. Hallucinations will cover a great\r\ndeal of ground.\r\n\r\n“But we feel that our personal experiences, in witnessing the interior\r\nof the Thomahlia cannot be thus explained away. Our accounts tally too\r\nexactly; and we are not subject to group hypnosis.\r\n\r\n“To explain this we believe a new hypothesis is called for. We submit\r\nthat what we saw was not unreal. Assuming that a thing is real or\r\nunreal, and can never be in a third state which is neither one nor the\r\nother, then we should have to insist that what we saw was REAL.\r\n\r\n“We stand ready and prepared to accept any theory which will fit all\r\nfacts, not merely a portion.”\r\n\r\nAgain refraining from any comment we pass on to the more exhaustive\r\nopinion of Sir Henry Hodges. Inasmuch as this seems to coincide very\r\nclosely with the hypothesis of Professor Holcomb, and as the reputation\r\nof Sir Henry is a thing of weight, we are quoting him almost verbatim:\r\n\r\n“There is a well-known experiment in chemistry, wherein equal quantities\r\nof water and alcohol are mixed. Let us say, a pint of each. Now, the\r\nresulting mixture ought to be a quart; but it is not. It is somewhat\r\nless than a quart.\r\n\r\n“Strange, indeed, to the novice, but a commonplace to every student of\r\nthe subject. It is strange only that, except for Dr. Holcomb and\r\nthis man Avec, science has overlooked the stupendous significance and\r\nsuggestion of this particular fact.\r\n\r\n“Now, consider another well-known fact: No matter how you try you cannot\r\nprevent gravity from acting. It will pull every object down, regardless\r\nof how you try to screen it from the earth.\r\n\r\n“Why? Because gravity penetrates all things. Again, why? Why should\r\ngravity penetrate all things?\r\n\r\n“The answer is, because gravity is a function of the ether. And the\r\nether is an imponderable substance, so impalpable that it passes right\r\nthrough all solids as though they were not there.\r\n\r\n“These are two highly suggestive points. They show us, first, that two\r\nsubstances can exist within the space formerly thought to be completely\r\nfilled by one. Second, they show that ALL substances are porous to the\r\nether.\r\n\r\n“Very well. Bear in mind that we know nothing whatever directly about\r\nthe ether; our knowledge is all indirect. Therefore--\r\n\r\n“It may be that there is more than one ether!\r\n\r\n“Conceive what this means. If there were another ether, how could we\r\nbecome aware of it? Only through the medium of some such phenomenon as\r\nthe Blind Spot; not through ordinary channels. For the ordinary channels\r\nare microscopes and test-tubes, every one of which, when traced to the\r\nultimate, is simply a concrete expression of THE ONE ETHER WE KNOW!\r\n\r\n“In the nature of the case our five senses could never apprehend a\r\nsecond ether.\r\n\r\n“Yet, knowing what we do about the structure of the atom, of electronic\r\nactivity, of quantels, we must admit that there is a huge, unoccupied\r\nspace--that is, we can't see that it is occupied--in and between the\r\ninterstices of the atom.\r\n\r\n“It is in the region, mingled and intertwined with the electrons which\r\nmake up the world we know so well, that--in my opinion--the Thomahlian\r\nworld exists. It is actually coexistent with our own. It is here, and\r\nso are we. At this very instant, at any given spot, there can be,\r\nand almost certainly is, more than one solid object--two systems of\r\nmateriality, two systems of life, two systems of death. And if two, why,\r\nthen, perhaps there are even more!\r\n\r\n“Holcomb is right. We are Infinity. Only our five senses make us\r\nfinite.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte Fenton does not indulge in speculation. She seems to bear up\r\nwonderfully well in the face of Harry Wendel's affinity for the\r\nNervina, and also in the face of her brother's disappearance. And she\r\nphilosophically states:\r\n\r\n“When Columbus returned from his search for the East Indies, he\r\ntriumphantly announced that he had found what he sought.\r\n\r\n“He was mistaken. He had found something else--America.\r\n\r\n“It may be that we are all mistaken. It may be that something entirely\r\ndifferent from what any one has suspected has been found. Time will\r\ntell. I am willing to wait.”\r\n\r\nTo make it complete, it is felt that the following statement of General\r\nHume is not only essential, but convincing to the last degree.\r\n\r\n“My view regarding this mystery is simply this: I have eyes, and I\r\nhave seen. I don't know whether the actors were living or dead. I am\r\nno scientist; I have no theory. I only know. And I will swear to what I\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\n“I am a soldier. The two men who are bringing this to press have shown\r\nme their copy.\r\n\r\n“It is correct.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Blind Spot, by Austin Hall and Homer Eon Flint",
