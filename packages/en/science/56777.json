Historians\r\nas a rule have devoted small space to consideration of material; in\r\nparticular, the story of the revolutionary changes in naval material\r\nwhich took place during the nineteenth century has never been placed\r\nbefore the public in convenient form. In the attempt to supply such a\r\ndescription I have taken the liberty, as an engineer, of treating of\r\nnaval material as a whole; tracing, as well as my technical knowledge\r\npermits, the progress of all the three principal elements--ship, gun,\r\nengine--and their interdependence. The result, faulty and incomplete\r\nas it is, may nevertheless be of considerable service, it is hoped,\r\nin clarifying the work of the historians and bridging the gap which\r\ndivides the classic histories from our modern text-books.\r\n\r\nI have considered our modern navy to begin with the “Admiral” class of\r\nbattleship, about the year 1880.\r\n\r\nMy respectful thanks are due to the heads of three Admiralty\r\ndepartments: Captain R. H. Crooke, C.B., lately Director of Naval\r\nOrdnance; Engineer Vice-Admiral Sir George Goodwin, K.C.B., LL.D.,\r\nEngineer-in-Chief of the Fleet; and Sir Eustace T. D’Eyncourt, K.C.B.,\r\nDirector of Naval Construction; for their unofficial approval. I wish\r\nto acknowledge my indebtedness to the officials of the Admiralty\r\nand the R.U.S.I. libraries, for their invariable kindness; to the\r\nDirectors of the British and S. Kensington Museums, for permission to\r\nreproduce pictures in their possession; to Mr. A. W. Johns, C.B.E.,\r\nAssistant Director of Naval Construction, Engineer Commander E. C.\r\nSmith, O.B.E., R.N., Mr. H. W. Dickinson, of the S. Kensington Museum,\r\nMr. Edward Fraser, and Sir George Hadcock, F.R.S., R.A., of Elswick,\r\nfor various help and criticism; and especially to Mr. L. G. Carr\r\nLaughton, of the Admiralty library, of whose advice and knowledge I\r\nhave often availed myself, and to whose encouragement the completion of\r\nthe work has been largely due.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to state that the whole of the book is written and\r\npublished on my own responsibility, and that it is in no manner or\r\ndegree an official publication.\r\n\r\n            F. L. R.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n     I.

Few are the writers who have dealt with it, and, for\r\nreasons which will appear, few of those have written in the English\r\nlanguage. Such books as treat of it are too cumbrous and technical\r\nfor easy reading; they are not written in the modern style; by the\r\nfrequent digressions of their authors on matters of general history,\r\nhigh politics, battles, economics, commerce, and even sport, they\r\nbear witness to the difficulties of the task and the complexity of\r\nthe subject. The history of naval architecture still remains to be\r\nwritten. In the meantime the student will find the monumental _Marine\r\nArchitecture_, of Charnock, and the smaller _Naval Architecture_, of\r\nFincham, invaluable fields of inquiry; among the historians the works\r\nof Nicolas, Laughton, Corbett and Oppenheim, will furnish him with the\r\nmaterials for the complete story of the evolution up to the end of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe following pages give a sketch, drawn chiefly from these authors,\r\nof the progress of the timber-built sailing ship and of the principal\r\ninfluences which guided the evolution. Lessons may still be drawn from\r\nthis history, it is suggested, which even in the altered circumstances\r\nof to-day may be of value in some other application. One lesson,\r\nlong unlearnt, the great blunder of two centuries, lies clearly on\r\nthe surface. The evidence will show how, by our long neglect of the\r\nscience of naval architecture, the British navy fought frequently at\r\nan unnecessary disadvantage; but it will also show how, masters of the\r\nart of shipbuilding, we gave our fleets such a superiority in strength\r\nand seaworthiness as almost to neutralize the defects inherent in their\r\ngeneral design.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nBefore the fourteenth century the sailing ship, i.e. the ship in which\r\nsails were used as the chief motive power, could not compete in battle\r\non equal terms with the oar-driven vessel; both in the Mediterranean\r\nand in Northern waters the oar-driven galley possessed advantages of\r\nspeed and handiness which relegated the heavy, high-built and capacious\r\nsailing ship to the position of a mere transport or victualler. The\r\nfighting ships were the galleys: long speedy vessels with fine lines\r\nand low freeboard, propelled by rowers and fought by soldiers clad in\r\nmail and armed with swords and lances. Sails were carried, but only as\r\nsecondary power, for use when the galleys ran before the wind.\r\n\r\nSea tactics consisted in ramming and boarding; the vessels were\r\ndesigned accordingly. The royal galleys of King Henry III, which formed\r\nthe fighting fleet of Hubert de Burgh, are described as having each\r\ntwo tiers of oars, with platforms along each side over the heads of\r\nthe rowers, on which the soldiers stood. Hung on the bulwarks in front\r\nof them were their shields. From the gaudily painted mast pennons and\r\nbanners floated on the wind; a large square cotton sail, embroidered\r\nwith the royal arms, was triced to the yard. The masthead was crowned\r\nwith a circular “top,” a repository for bricks and iron bars wherewith\r\nto bilge an enemy vessel. At both ends of the galley were raised\r\nplatforms or “castles” filled with picked soldiery, who during the\r\napproach to action would pour brass-winged arrows into the enemy and\r\nwho, when the enemy had been grappled, leaped aboard. From mechanical\r\nengines low down in the waist large stones would be projected, and, if\r\non the windy side, quicklime would be thrown, and other “instruments\r\nof annoyance.” The galleys were lightly built, and carried no pumps.\r\nIt was no uncommon sight, we are told, to see half the knights baling,\r\nwhile the others fought hand-to-hand with the enemy.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1300 the size and utility of ships had made considerable\r\nadvance. Two masts were given them, each supported by a few shrouds\r\nand carrying a single large square sail; neither masts nor sails were\r\nyet subdivided, but the sails could be enlarged by having one or more\r\n“bonnets” laced to their lower part. Of the two masts the taller, the\r\nforemast, raked considerably over the bows, and both were surmounted by\r\ntops, with flagstaff and streamers. A central rudder appeared in this\r\ncentury, in place of the paddle fixed to the quarter, and a rudimentary\r\nbowsprit. The largest _cogs_, as they were now called, were of 250 tons\r\nburthen. When hired of merchants for war service, they were converted\r\nby the addition of fore-, aft-, and top-castles, built high so as to\r\novertop, if possible, the enemy. The war vessels were at this time\r\nlavishly decorated; the sails were silk, dyed red or embroidered with\r\narmorial designs, the tops and stages were aflame with banners and\r\npennons, the masts and yards were gilt. Large sums of money were spent\r\nby the knights in beautifying their ships.\r\n\r\nBut in this century two great inventions brought to a close an epoch\r\nin warship construction. Gunpowder and the mariner’s compass were\r\ndiscovered. Cannon were adapted to ships in place of the mechanical\r\nengines which had formerly been carried, and by aid of the compass,\r\nhoused in its wood-pegged bittacle in the steerage, vessels began\r\nto venture out of touch with land and sail with a new security the\r\nuncharted ocean.\r\n\r\nThe effect of each of these two discoveries was the same: a growth in\r\nthe size, strength, and capacity of ships, a decline in the use of\r\noars and a greater reliance on sails. High sides were required against\r\nthe waves, stouter timbers to support the weight of ordnance, more\r\ncapacious holds for the stowage of the ballast, food, and cordage which\r\nwould be needed for a long sea voyage. The galley, with its low flush\r\ndeck and outward-sloping sides was ill adapted for the new conditions;\r\na new construction was seen to be needed. Two new types were evolved,\r\none in the Mediterranean and one, more gradually, in Atlantic waters.\r\n\r\nEven before the Christian era there had been a distinct differentiation\r\nbetween the ships of the Mediterranean and those of the Atlantic\r\nseaboard. The latter, as shown by Nicolas’ quotation from Cæsar, were\r\nmore strongly built than the Roman galleys, with flatter bottoms, to\r\n“adapt them to the shallows and to sustain without danger the ebbing\r\nof the tide,” and with prows and sterns “very high and erect, to\r\nbear the hugeness of the waves”: properties which, even before the\r\nadvent of fire artillery, conferred on them important advantages.[1]\r\nNevertheless, complete differentiation did not obtain until after the\r\ndiscovery of gunpowder and the mariner’s needle. Before that time the\r\nvessels used by the Northern nations in war were of the galley type,\r\nbuilt by themselves or, after the Crusades had revealed the superiority\r\nof the Mediterranean powers in warship design, hired not infrequently\r\nfrom Venetians or from Genoese. The Genoese were the chief naval\r\nmercenaries of Europe at this age: “Genoese were vice-admirals to the\r\nEnglish king, and Genoese galleys fought for the French at Sluys.”\r\n\r\nThe new type evolved in the Mediterranean was the _galleasse_. For\r\ncenturies, as we have seen, large sailing ships had been used for\r\ncommerce, both in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. With the\r\ninevitable increase in size brought about by the adoption of cannon,\r\nand by the desire for greater sea-keeping qualities, resort was now\r\nhad by the Genoese and Venetians to sails in war vessels as a means\r\nof propulsion of equal importance with oars. Thus an uncomfortable\r\ncompromise was effected between oars and sails; both were provided. The\r\ngalleasse was originally a large decked galley, with three pole masts\r\nfor its lateen sails, and with cannon spaced at intervals along its\r\nsides above the rowers. In form it differed little from the galley,\r\nbut in the disposition of its armament it was entirely different; it\r\nrepresented the first stage in the evolution of the broadside fighting\r\nship.\r\n\r\nBut the galleasse, though it might meet the requirements of\r\nMediterranean warfare, was almost as unsuited as the galley to\r\nAtlantic conditions. Accordingly the warship underwent a separate and\r\nindependent development at the hands of the Atlantic nations. Forsaking\r\nthe galley, they took the lofty, strong and capacious sailing merchant\r\nship as the basis of a new type, and from the lumbering carrack and\r\ncaravel and dromon they evolved the vessel which eventually became\r\nknown as the _galleon_. A distinctive naval architecture, Gothic rather\r\nthan Byzantine in character, was thus founded on the Atlantic seaboard.\r\nThe oar was entirely superseded by the sail. The ships were high, and\r\ntheir sides, instead of falling out like those of galleys, were curved\r\ninwards so as to “tumble home” above the water-line: an arrangement\r\nwhich protected the ordnance, added to the strength of the vessels,\r\nand tended to render them steadier gun-platforms. The top-castles were\r\nretained on the masts, but the end-castles disappeared, or rather,\r\nwere incorporated into the structure of the lofty bow and stern, to\r\nprovide accommodation for officers, and cover for the crew. The _voile\r\nlatine_ gave way to the _voile quarrée_. In place of the large lateen\r\nsails carried by galley and galleasse, were smaller sails and courses,\r\nsquare, more easily manipulated and allowing of greater variation in\r\ndisposition and effective area, to suit the conditions of weather and\r\nthe trim of the ship.\r\n\r\nThroughout the fifteenth century the sailing ship developed. “While\r\nin the first quarter,” writes Mr. Oppenheim of English shipping, “we\r\nfind that men-of-war possess, at the most, two masts and two sails,\r\ncarry three or four guns, and one or two rudimentary bowsprits, at\r\nthe close of the same century they are three- or four-masters, with\r\ntopmasts and topsails, bowsprit and spritsail, and conforming to the\r\ncharacteristics of the type which remained generally constant for more\r\nthan two centuries.” The English mariner had by this time acquired his\r\nhonourable reputation. In merchant ships he carried Bordeaux wine,\r\nthe casks of which became the unit for measurement of their tunnage;\r\neven in winter months, we are told, he braved the Bay with pilgrims on\r\ntour to the shrine of St. James of Compostella. Large royal ships of\r\nover 1000 tons burthen were built, in the early part of the century,\r\nin English yards. As builders the Normans seem at this time to have\r\nexcelled.[2] But the most wonderful development of the science of\r\nseamanship in all its branches took place in the Peninsula. Largely\r\nthrough the inspiration of one man the greatest efforts of Spain and\r\nPortugal were directed to the cult of navigation and geography, the\r\nimprovement of shipbuilding, and the discovery of new and distant\r\nlands and oceans. A brilliant impetus was given to the study of ship\r\nconstruction by the voyages of Columbus, the Cabots, Vasco di Gama, and\r\nother intrepid spirits who, by aid of the compass, braved the moral and\r\nphysical terrors of far-distant voyages--“fighting immensity with a\r\nneedle.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nWith the development of artillery the value of the sailing ship for\r\nsea warfare came gradually to view. Naval tactics suffered a complete\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nUntil the early days of the sixteenth century sea-fights had been\r\nland-fights in character; ships came as quickly as possible to close\r\nquarters, grappled or charged one another, cut rigging, and essayed to\r\nboard. The sailor was subservient to the soldier. The gun, represented\r\nin the main by serpentines, periers, murderers, and other quick-firing\r\npieces, was primarily a defensive armament, for the defence, firstly,\r\nof the entire ship, or, in the event of the waist being captured, of\r\nthe fortified end citadels or castles. “These castles, which in vessels\r\nespecially constructed for war came to take the form of a forecastle\r\nand a half-deck, were made musket-proof; and being closed athwartship\r\nwith similarly protected bulkheads, known as ‘cubbridge-heads,’ were\r\nimpenetrable to boarders; while at the same time, by means of loopholes\r\nand quick-firing pieces in-board, they could enfilade the waist with\r\nmusketry and murdering shot. Thus a ship of the English pattern, at any\r\nrate, could rarely be held even if boarders entered, until her ‘cage\r\nworks’ or protected castles were destroyed by gunfire.”[3] The ship\r\nitself, being deep-waisted and built with an exaggerated sheer upwards\r\ntoward bow and stem, had no continuous deck: the decks were laid on\r\nvarious levels, rising from the waist by steps to the two citadels,\r\nan arrangement which did not contribute, as a flush-deck would have\r\ndone, to the longitudinal strength of the vessel, and which was found\r\ninconvenient for the working and transport of ordnance of the heavier\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nKing Henry VIII, in his efforts to possess fighting ships superior\r\nto those of Spain, France and Scotland, raised not only artillery\r\nbut ships themselves to a different rôle. As he personally urged the\r\nmanufacture of ordnance in this country by the subsidizing of foreign\r\ntalent, so he sought to improve the design of his ships by inviting\r\nItalian shipwrights to come to England and apply their knowledge to\r\nthe royal vessels. Dockyards were founded at Woolwich, Deptford, and\r\nPortsmouth. Large ships were laid down, several were rebuilt, with many\r\nimprovements embodied in them: chief of these being a new artillery\r\narmament. The king had seized the advantages of the sailing ship with\r\nbroadside fire. “The development of broadside fire,” says Sir Julian\r\nCorbett, “was a question of gunnery, of naval architecture, and of\r\nseamanship. With Henry’s introduction of heavy guns on board his larger\r\nvessels, however, the true note had been struck, and by the end of his\r\nreign the first two arts had made great strides. Guns of all patterns\r\nand sizes were being cast in England, both in bronze and iron, which\r\nwere little inferior to those Nelson fought with.” The result of the\r\nking’s efforts was seen in the ships laid down in the last years\r\nof his reign. The frontispiece of Mr. Oppenheim’s _History of the\r\nAdministration of the Royal Navy_ is a picture of one of these, the\r\n_Tiger_, a four-masted flush-decked vessel, with no sheer, little top\r\nhamper, a long tier of ordnance on the gun deck, and with a beak-head\r\nending in a spur: one of a class “which shows a very great advance on\r\nanything before afloat and indicates a steady progression towards the\r\nmodern type.”\r\n\r\nIn short, a reversion to a smaller and seaworthier type took place. The\r\nlarge, unstable and unwieldy “great ship,” such as the _Henry Grace\r\ná Dieu_, built on the Spanish model, with lofty ends overweighted\r\nwith small ordnance, was not effective. A new invention, attributed\r\nto Descharges of Brest in 1501, viz. the adaptation of portholes to\r\nordnance along the sides of a ship, perhaps suggested a better form.\r\nAs the century advanced, as new and far-distant countries appeared on\r\nthe map, the arts of seamanship and gunnery continuously improved;\r\nnaval architecture made a corresponding progress. For sea fighting the\r\nhigh-charged and imposing “great ship” gave place to a more perfected\r\ntype--the galleon. “It was the development of the galleon,” insists the\r\nhistorian, “which changed the naval art from its medieval to its modern\r\nstate.” The galley, eminently suited to the Mediterranean, where winds\r\nwere light and slave labour abundant, was found to be increasingly\r\nunsuitable for Atlantic warfare; the galley was in danger of being\r\nrammed, in any wind, by a strong, quick-turning sailing ship, and\r\nsuffered from having nearly all its artillery in the bows; moreover,\r\n“the galley service was always repugnant to our national temperament.”\r\nThe galleasse, the hybrid between the oar-driven galley and the sailing\r\nship, suffered from all the disadvantages of the compromise. The\r\ngreat ship had now proved to be cumbrous and expensive, crank and\r\nunseaworthy, leewardly and unmanageable in even a moderate breeze.\r\n\r\nThe galleon therefore became the type favoured by the English navy.\r\nWhereas the merchant ship was short in proportion to its beam, the\r\ngalleon was built long, with a length equal to three times its breadth.\r\nIt had also a long flat floor like a galley, and was of lower freeboard\r\nthan a round-ship. “It was also like a galley flush-decked, and would\r\nseem always to have had the half-deck carried across the waist so as to\r\nmake one flush-deck with the old forecastle. In the larger types the\r\nquarter-deck was also carried flush from stem to stem, so that latterly\r\nat any rate a true galleon had at least two decks and sometimes three.\r\nOn the upper deck in the earlier types were erected both fore and aft\r\nhigh-castles as in a galleasse, but usually on curved lines, which\r\ngave the hull of the old-fashioned galleons the appearance of a half\r\nmoon.”[4] The depth of hold at the waist was only about two-fifths the\r\nbeam. Its artillery was light but effective, being composed of light\r\nmuzzle loaders, a mean between the man-killers and the heavy bombards\r\nof an earlier day. Its masts and spars were made heavy and large sail\r\narea was given it, for speed and quick manœuvring were the essential\r\nqualities which it was hoped to oppose to the lumbering, high-charged\r\nships of Spain. Victory was to be sought by a skilful combination of\r\nseamanship and gunnery, rapid fire being poured into an enemy at a\r\nconvenient range and bearing. “Plenty of room and a stand-off fight”\r\nsufficiently defines the sea tactics of the new era.\r\n\r\nThroughout the reign of Elizabeth the galleon still remained the\r\nfavourite type, though opinion differed, and continued to differ\r\nthrough the two following centuries, as to the degree to which it\r\nwas desirable to “build lofty.” The Hawkins family of Plymouth\r\nshipowners carried a great influence in the councils of the navy.\r\nSir John Hawkins, whose experience of shipbuilding and seamanship\r\nrendered him a man of importance, was the author of improvements in\r\nthis respect, as in so many others; “the first Elizabethan men-of-war,\r\nthe fastest sailers and best sea-boats then afloat, were built to his\r\nplans; and from the time of his appointment as Treasurer of the Navy\r\ndates the change to the relatively low and long type that made the\r\nEnglish ships so much more handy than their Spanish antagonists.”[5]\r\nHis kinsman, Sir Richard, on the other hand, preferred large and\r\nhigh-charged ships, “not only for their moral effect on the enemy, but\r\nfor their superiority in boarding and the heavier ordnance and larger\r\ncrews they would carry. Two decks and a half he considers to be the\r\nleast a great ship should have, and was of opinion that the fashion\r\nfor galleasse-built ships--or, as he calls them, ‘race’ ships--in\r\npreference to those ‘lofty-built’ had been pushed too far.”[6] Ships\r\nwith large cage-works had an advantage, he maintained, in affording\r\ncover for the crew and positions for quick-firing batteries; his\r\nopponents argued that the weight of top-hamper saved by their abolition\r\ncould be put with better advantage into a heavy artillery.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the fast, low-lying ships carried the day. War came\r\nwith Spain, and there was soon work to show what the English ships\r\ncould do. The _Armada Papers_[7] light up for us, by the fitful glare\r\nof the cressets of Hawkins and Co., the preparation of the fleet at\r\nPlymouth, and show us what state of efficiency the royal ships were\r\nin. “The _Hope_ and _Nonpariel_ are both graved, tallowed, and this\r\ntide into the road again,” writes William Hawkins to his brother. “We\r\ntrim one side of every ship by night and the other side by day, so\r\nthat we end the three great-ships in three days this spring. The ships\r\nsit aground so strongly, and are so staunch as if they were made of a\r\nwhole tree. The doing of it is very chargeable, for that it is done by\r\ntorchlight and cressets, and in an extreme gale of wind, which consumes\r\npitch, tallow, and firs abundantly.” Not only the few royal ships, but\r\nthe whole of the force which lies in the Sound is tuned for the fight.\r\n“For Mr. Hawkins’ bargain,” writes the Commander-in-Chief to Lord\r\nBurghley, “this much I will say: I have been aboard of every ship that\r\ngoeth out with me, and in every place where any may creep, and there is\r\nnever a one of them that knows what a leak means. I do thank God that\r\nthey be in the estate they be in.” The Spanish ships prove to be in a\r\nvery different condition. High-charged and leewardly, poorly rigged\r\nand lightly gunned, they are so hammered and raked by Lord Howard’s\r\nwell-found fleet that, when bad weather ultimately comes, they are in\r\nno condition to combat the elements. With masts and rigging shattered,\r\nwater-casks smashed, no anchors; short-handed and leaking like sieves,\r\nthey are hounded northwards to a disaster unparalleled in naval history.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before tracing its evolution through the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, let us glance at the warship as it existed at the\r\nend of the Elizabethan era, and note its chief constructive features.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nAthwart a keel of large squared timbers, scarphed together and forming\r\nwith a massive inner keelson the principal member or backbone, were\r\nlaid the curved frames or ribs which, bolted to each other and to\r\nthe keel with iron bolts washered and clinched, gave to the hull its\r\ntransverse strength and form. These frames were held together, as they\r\ncurved upward from the ground or floor level, by thick longitudinal\r\nwales, worked externally along the frames at convenient heights, and\r\ncurved so as to suit the degree of sheer desired.\r\n\r\nAt the fore end the wales and frames converged to the centre-line and\r\nthe keel was prolonged upward to meet them in a curve or compassing\r\ntimber, forming the bow or stem: to the beauty and shapeliness of\r\nwhich, with its projecting beak-head, the builder devoted much of his\r\nattention and skill. At the other end the frames and wales converged\r\nto a square and lofty stern. The stern post was a massive timber\r\nfastened to the keel and sloping somewhat aft from the vertical, and\r\nfrom it rose two fashion-pieces “like a pair of great horns,” which\r\nformed, with the horizontal arch and transom timbers, the framework of\r\nthe stern. When the frames had been built up to the requisite height\r\nthe upper ends of each opposite pair were joined across by horizontal\r\nbeams, which were secured to them by means of brackets or knees; such\r\nbeams were worked at the level of the main and other decks, and served\r\nto support them when laid. Joined by its beams, each pair of frames\r\nthus formed a closed structure: a combination of members which was to\r\nresist crushing and deformation, the blows of the sea, the stresses\r\nof gunfire, the forces due to the weight of the guns and the vessel\r\nitself, and especially the forces thrown on it when the vessel was\r\naground or on a careen. The rigidity of this combination was enhanced\r\nby the fitting of pillars which were placed vertically over the keelson\r\nto support each beam at its middle. And sometimes the lower pillars\r\nwere supplemented by sloping struts, worked from the curve of the\r\nframes up to the middle of each beam above.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of a ship thus formed, built with well-seasoned timber,\r\nwas left standing on the stocks “in frame” for a considerable period,\r\nsometimes for years, exposed to the open weather. On it eventually\r\na skin of planks was fastened, secured by wood trenails split and\r\nexpanded by soft-wood wedges, both internally and externally; and\r\ninside the ship, to reinforce the frames and in line with them, timbers\r\nknown as “riders” were worked. On the beams the decks were laid: the\r\norlop below the water-line level, and above it, at a height suitable\r\nfor the ordnance, the main or gun deck; above that the upper deck,\r\non the ends of which were reared the poop (sometimes a half-deck,\r\nextending from the stern to the mainmast, sometimes on that a\r\nquarter-deck, over the steerage) and the forecastle.\r\n\r\nSuch, very briefly, was the mode of ship construction. The resulting\r\nstructure, when caulked and swelled by sea-water, presented a\r\nwater-tight and serviceable vessel. Timber provided, for ships up to a\r\ncertain size, a suitable material. It afforded strength and buoyancy,\r\nand elasticity sufficient to obviate local strains and to spread the\r\nstresses due to lading, grounding, careening, or the actions of the\r\nwind and sea. The different parts of the ship’s frame gave mutual\r\nsupport, and the pressure of the fluid on the exterior of the hull\r\ntended, by constraining the component parts, to preserve the vessel.[8]\r\n\r\nBut the timber-built ship possessed an inherent weakness. Metal plates\r\nor girders can be bolted or riveted together so efficiently as to\r\nleave the joints between them almost as strong as the sections of the\r\nplates or girders themselves. Not so wood beams. However skilfully\r\nthey might be joined, their joints were necessarily weaker than all\r\nother sections: “it was then, and still is, impracticable to develop\r\nthe full strength in end connections between wooden members.”[9]\r\nThe softness of the wood was an additional source of weakness. Two\r\nbeams fastened together by iron bolts might form initially a close\r\nand rigid joint; but if, under the action of alternating or racking\r\nstresses, they became loosened even in a minute degree, the tendency\r\nto become still looser increased: the wood gradually yielded under\r\nthe bolt washers, the bolts no longer held rigidly, “the very fact\r\nthat wood and iron were dissimilar materials tended to hasten the\r\ndisintegration of the structure.” With planking a similar effect\r\nobtained. Trenails, expanded by wedges and planed off flush with the\r\nplanks which they held together, had only shearing strength; if once\r\nthey were loosened they had little power to prevent the planks from\r\nopening further. These weaknesses were recognised. To minimize their\r\neffects the butts of frames, decks, and side planking, were arranged\r\nso that no two neighbouring butts lay in the same line. But in spite\r\nof the most painstaking craftsmanship, the size of the wooden ship\r\nwas limited by its inability to withstand a high degree of stress.\r\nAs sizes increased extraordinary endeavours were made to meet the\r\nhogging and sagging strains, to prevent cambering of the hull, and to\r\nstiffen it longitudinally and circumferentially. Enormous masses of\r\ntimber were worked into the internal structure in the form of riders,\r\npillars, standards, and shores, “the whole of which had an appearance\r\nof great strength, but which in fact, from its weight and injudicious\r\ncombinations, was useless, if not injurious.”[10] Which did, in fact,\r\nclog the ship and usurp the space required for stowage.\r\n\r\nAs for the masts, experience fixed their number, size and position.\r\nIn the earlier ships, as we have seen, four and sometimes five masts\r\nwere fitted, after the Mediterranean style. But later this number was\r\nreduced to three. Of these the foremast was the most important, and it\r\nwas stepped directly over the fore-foot of the vessel, the main and\r\nmizzen being pitched to suit. Their height varied with the service and\r\ntype of ship. Taunt masts, like those carried by the Flemish ships,\r\nwere best for sailing on a wind, for with them narrow sails could be\r\nused which could be set at a sharp angle with the keel; but short masts\r\nand broad yards were favoured by English mariners, as bringing less\r\nstrain on a vessel’s sides and rigging and as being less likely to\r\nproduce a state of dangerous instability. The masts were short, very\r\nthick, and heavily shrouded; the standing rigging was led to channels\r\nand deadeyes on the outside of the bulwarks. The bowsprits were large\r\nand “steved” upward at a large angle with the horizontal; spritsails\r\nand spritsail topsails were set on them, of use mainly when sailing\r\nbefore a wind, yet retaining their place in our navy till, half-way\r\nthrough the eighteenth century, the introduction of the fore-and-aft\r\njib brought about an improvement and in so doing affected the whole\r\ndisposition of mastage.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the masting of the old ships is notable: the manner in\r\nwhich the various masts were raked. In the _Sea-Man’s Dictionary_[11]\r\nthe _trim_ of a ship was defined as, “the condition, as to draught,\r\nstaying of masts, slackness of shrouds, etc., in which a ship goes\r\nbest.” For a given set of conditions there was a certain rake of\r\nmasts, a certain position of the centre of wind-pressure against the\r\nsails, which, when discovered, gave to the vessel its finest sailing\r\nqualities. The knowledge of this adjustment constituted no small part\r\nof the great art of seamanship. In the king’s ships a high proficiency\r\nwas attained in it; merchantmen sailed under more diverse conditions\r\nand showed, it appears, a lower level of scientific inquiry. “Next to\r\nmen of war (whose daily practice it is) the Scotch men are the best\r\nin the world to find out the trym of a ship, for they will never be\r\nquiet, but try her all ways, and if there be any goodness in her, they\r\ncan make her go.” Generally, the effect of raking the masts aft was to\r\nmake the vessel fly up into the wind, and vice versa; in ships with\r\nhigh-built sterns, especially, it was necessary to have the head-sails\r\nset well forward, to keep them out of the wind. To allow the masts to\r\nbe raked as desired their heels were pared away, and wedges of suitable\r\nthickness were driven between them and the “partners.”\r\n\r\nMany other factors contributed to affect, in a manner always subtle\r\nand frequently inexplicable, the sailing qualities of a ship. The form\r\nof the body, the position of masts and the setting up of the rigging,\r\nthe disposition of weights, the angle of the yards, the conditions of\r\nstability, all had their effect on the vessel’s motion, and therefore\r\non her speed through the water. Free water in a ship’s bilge, for\r\nexample, had an effect on her degree of stiffness, and from this cause\r\nher speed was not easily predictable. Charnock relates how, in the\r\ncolonial wars of the late eighteenth century, an American vessel, the\r\n_Hancock_, was captured after an unprecedented chase, solely because\r\nher commander, injudiciously supposing that by lightening his ship he\r\nwould enhance her swiftness, pumped water out of her. It was noticed,\r\nagain, that in certain circumstances the speed of a ship increased when\r\nthe crew turned into their hammocks.\r\n\r\nThe lines of the ship were drawn without reference to any science\r\nof naval architecture, and merely by instinct and the accumulated\r\nexperience of the builder; the laws of stability and of fluid\r\nresistance were at this time unknown. Experience indicated the\r\ndesirability of a short keel, to make the ship turn quickly; of an\r\nample rake forward from keel to beak-head--“more than a third the\r\nlength of the keel, commonly,” says Sir Henry Manwayring, for, “a great\r\nrake forward gives a ship good way and makes her keep a good wind, but\r\nif she have not a full bow it will make her pitch mightily into a head\r\nsea.... The longer a ship’s rake is, the fuller must be the bow”; of\r\na fine run aft, so as to let the water flow strongly and swiftly to\r\nthe rudder and make the ship steer and sail well; of a narrow rudder,\r\nso as not to hold much dead water when the helm was over,--yet, “if a\r\nship have a fat quarter, she will require a broad rudder.” The correct\r\nformation of the bow was recognised as of the greatest importance,\r\nand the most difficult compromise in the design of a ship. A bow too\r\nbluff offered much resistance to motion through the water; on the other\r\nhand, too sharp a bow lacked buoyancy, and, from the great weight of\r\nmastage, headsails, anchors, etc., which it had to support, caused a\r\nvessel to pitch badly in a head sea. “If the bow be too broad,” wrote\r\nCaptain John Smith, in his _Sea Man’s Grammar_, “she will seldom carry\r\na bone in her mouth, or cut a feather, that is, to make a foam before\r\nher: where a well-bowed ship so swiftly presseth the water as that it\r\nfoameth, and in the dark night sparkleth like fire.”\r\n\r\nGenerally, a vessel built with fine lines lacked end support,\r\nand tended to become arched or camber-keeled, while its stowage\r\ncapacity was inconveniently small. The ship’s sides were made with a\r\nconsiderable degree of tumble-home above the water-line; though this,\r\nagain, was a point of compromise and much argument. For while a reduced\r\nbreadth of deck tended to give the hull more girder strength and to\r\ndiminish the racking effect on it of heavy ordnance, yet this feature\r\nat the same time, by reducing the angle at which the shrouds could be\r\nset, augmented the stresses which were thrown on shrouds and bulwarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nWith the seventeenth century a new age of scientific speculation\r\nopened, and, under the personal encouragement of the Stuart kings, the\r\nart and mystery of shipbuilding received an illumination which was of\r\ngreat value to the royal armaments.\r\n\r\nThe early interest of James I in his navy is signalized by his grant\r\nof a charter to the corporation of shipwrights: a corporation whose\r\nshort-lived story is told by the editor of _The Autobiography of\r\nPhineas Pett_, recently published.[12] Before the sixteenth century, he\r\ntells us, no special trade was recognized for the building of warships,\r\nas distinct from traders. But in the early Tudor days, when, owing to\r\nthe introduction of the new artillery the war vessel began to diverge\r\nin general design from the merchant ship, certain master shipwrights\r\nhad been subsidized by the king for the building and repair of the\r\nroyal vessels. The position of these officials was one of importance,\r\ntheir duties and privileges were extensive. The office was often\r\nhereditary. Thus, the royal patent granted to one James Baker in 1538\r\ndescended, with the accumulated lore and secrets of his profession, to\r\nhis son Mathew Baker in 1572. And that granted to Peter Pett in 1558\r\ndescended to Joseph Pett in 1590. But as shipping grew and shipbuilding\r\nbecame more complex and widely distributed, the need for some central\r\nauthority, which could regulate practice and standardize procedure,\r\nbecame increasingly felt. Accordingly a petition was presented. In 1605\r\nthe king granted a charter incorporating the master shipwrights of\r\nEngland as one body corporate and politic, for the good regulation of\r\nshipbuilding of all descriptions. In 1612 another charter was sealed,\r\ngiving increased power to the confraternity: with instruction that\r\nit was to examine each new ship to see that it was properly built,\r\n“with two orlops at convenient distances, strong to carry ordnance\r\naloft and alow, with her forecastle and half-deck close for fight.”\r\nShipwrights’ Hall, as the corporation was called, surveyed and reported\r\non tonnage and workmanship, and gave advice, when sought, to the\r\nlord high admiral. In the course of time its prestige declined. With\r\nthe Commonwealth it grew into disuse, and by 1690 it was altogether\r\nextinct. For nearly a century the guild had struggled in vain to fulfil\r\nthe intentions of its founders.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished of the master shipwrights of this period was\r\nPhineas Pett, sometime master of arts at Emmanuel College, Cambridge,\r\nwho in 1612 succeeded old Mathew Baker as Master of the guild.\r\nPett, who to a practical knowledge of design and construction added\r\nconsiderable sea experience, rose far above his contemporaries, most\r\nof whom were little more than mere carpenters, ignorant of many of\r\nthe principles which are now accepted as governing ship design, and\r\nthemselves governed almost entirely by tradition and blind precedent.\r\nScience was still in its veriest infancy. The progress of ship design\r\nwas still by the tentative and costly method of full-scale experience;\r\nnot till the beginning of the nineteenth century, when new forces and\r\nmaterials had been discovered which in the end spelt the decline and\r\nsupersession of the sailing ship, did science sufficiently direct the\r\nlines on which large sailing ships should be built.\r\n\r\nBy his bold deviation from established usage, says Fincham, Mr. Pett\r\nestablished his fame and advanced the interest and power of the British\r\nnavy. Before reviewing his handiwork, however, it will be convenient to\r\nnote the main directions in which improvement was at this period sought.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Manwayring, an acquaintance for whom Pett designed and\r\nbuilt a pinnace in the year 1616, wrote at this time _The Sea-Man’s\r\nDictionary_. In the early years of the century were also written two\r\ntreatises which, though not printed till a later date, had great\r\neffect in creating an interest in naval matters: Sir Walter Raleigh’s\r\n_Observations on the Navy_ and _Invention of Shipping_. In the former\r\npaper Sir Walter laid down the six requisites of a good ship: viz.\r\nthat she should be strongly built, swift, stout-sided, carry out her\r\nguns in all weathers, lie-to in a gale easily, and stay well. For the\r\nattainment of these qualities he specified certain structural features:\r\na long run forward, to make her sail well; a long bearing floor and\r\na “tumble home” above water from the lower edge of the ports, for\r\nstoutness and for stiffness sufficient to enable her to carry her lower\r\nordnance (which must lie four feet clear above water) in all weathers.\r\n“It is a special observation,” he wrote, “that all ships sharp before,\r\nthat want a long floor, will fall roughly into the sea and take in\r\nwater over head and ears. So will all narrow quartered ships sink\r\nafter the tail. The high charging of ships it is that brings them all\r\nill qualities.” In the latter paper he recapitulated the various\r\nimprovements in material of which he had himself been witness; from\r\nwhich for its interest we quote the following extract. “The striking\r\nof the topmast (a wonderful great ease to great ships both at sea and\r\nin harbour) hath been devised, together with the chain pump ... the\r\nbonnet and the drabler. We have fallen into consideration of the length\r\nof cables, and by it we resist the malice of the greatest winds that\r\ncan blow, witness our small Milbrook men of Cornwall, that ride it out\r\nat anchor, half seas over between England and Ireland, all the winter\r\nquarter.... For true it is, that the length of the cable is the life of\r\nthe ship in all extremities. We carry our ordnance better than we were\r\nwont, because our nether overloops are raised commonly from the water,\r\nto wit, between the lower part of the port and the sea. We have also\r\nraised our second decks and given more vent thereby to our ordnance,\r\ntying on our nether overloop. We have added cross pillars in our royal\r\nships to strengthen them, which be fastened from the kelson to the\r\nbeams of the second deck. We have given longer floors to our ships than\r\nin elder times, and better bearing under water, whereby they never fall\r\ninto the sea after the head and shake the whole body, nor sink stern,\r\nnor stoop upon a wind, by which the breaking loose of our ordnance or\r\nthe not use of them, with many other discommodities are avoided....\r\nAnd to say the truth a miserable shame and dishonour it were for our\r\nshipwrights, if they did not exceed all other in the setting up of our\r\nroyal ships, the errors of other nations being far more excusable than\r\nours.” Sir Walter was inaccurate in attributing all the improvements\r\nenumerated to his own generation; bonnets, for instance, were in use\r\nlong before his day. Nevertheless his paper constitutes one of the most\r\nimportant contributions to the history of naval architecture in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the century, too, evidence as to the shortcomings\r\nof contemporary naval construction was furnished by a fierce critic,\r\nCaptain Waymouth. He proclaimed that English shipwrights built only\r\nby uncertain traditional precepts and observations; that none of them\r\ncould build two ships alike or predict with accuracy their draught\r\nof water; that all their ships were crank, leewardly--“a great\r\ndisadvantage in a fight”--difficult to steer and sail, too deep in\r\nthe water, of less capacity than the Hollanders, and so badly built\r\nand designed as frequently to require “furring,” or reinforcing by\r\nextra planking. He advocated building ships longer, broader, with\r\nlonger floors so as to reduce their draught, and snugger in respect of\r\nupper works. And though he failed on trial to translate his ideas into\r\nsuccessful performance, his criticisms are accepted by historians as\r\nbeing probably well-founded.\r\n\r\nThe opinions expressed by the above writers[13] indicate for us\r\nin general terms the chief particulars in which the ships of this\r\nperiod fell short of naval requirements. They were designed without\r\nknowledge of the laws governing the strength of materials, stability,\r\nand the motion of bodies through water; they were built without\r\nadequate supervision, frequently of green timber badly scarphed or cut\r\nacross the grain, and were overburdened with ordnance. Their holds\r\nwere cumbered with large quantities of shingle ballast which tended\r\nto clog the limber-holes of the bilge and rot the frames and floor\r\ntimbers; while the stowage space amidships was further usurped by the\r\ncook-rooms, which were placed on the shingle, and which, by the heat\r\nradiated from their brick sides, did damage to the timbers and seams\r\nin their vicinity. Vessels were rarely sheathed. Though John Hawkins\r\nhad devised a system of sheathing by a veneer of planking nailed over\r\na layer of hair and tar, it was only to ships going on special service\r\nin seas where the worm was active that sheathing was applied. Sheathing\r\npossessed, then, some significance. In 1620, for instance, the Venetian\r\nambassador reported to his government the discovery that some of our\r\nships were being sheathed, and from this fact deduced an impending\r\nexpedition to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWith the navy in the depths of neglect and with shipbuilding in the\r\nstate described, Phineas Pett began to impose his permanent mark on\r\ndesign and construction. The mechanism by which he secured his results,\r\nthe calculations and methods and rules used by him, were veiled in\r\nprofound secrecy, in accordance with the traditions of his profession.\r\nHe began by new-building old ships of the Elizabethan time, giving\r\nthem an improved form so far as practicable. His friend and patron\r\nwas the young Prince Henry, for whom in 1607 he made a model which\r\nthe king greatly admired. And shortly after this, in the face of much\r\njealousy on the part of his rivals, he laid down by command a new\r\ngreat ship--the _Prince Royal_, of 1187 tons, with a breadth of 43 feet\r\nand a keel length of 115 feet, double-built and sumptuously adorned, in\r\nall respects the finest ship that had ever been built in England. She\r\ncarried no less than fifty-five guns, her general proportions were of a\r\nunity, and her strength was of a superiority, far in advance of current\r\npractice. In strength especially she marked an advance which yielded\r\nbenefit later, in the wars with Holland. She was double planked, “a\r\ncharge which was not formerly thought upon, and all the butt-heads were\r\ndouble-bolted with iron bolts.”\r\n\r\nBut how difficult a matter it was for a builder to depart from\r\ntradition, is shown from Pett’s account of the inquisition to which he\r\nwas subjected in connection with the building of this famous ship. His\r\nrivals took advantage of the “Commission of Enquiry into the abuses of\r\nthe navy,” of 1608, to indict him for bad design, bad building, and\r\npeculation. So much hard swearing took place on both sides that at last\r\nKing James himself decided to act as judge, and at Woolwich, with the\r\nwretched Phineas on his knees before him, opened his court of inquiry.\r\n“Much time,” says the diarist, “was spent in dispute of proportions,\r\ncomparing my present frame with former precedents and dimensions of the\r\nbest ships, for length, breadth, depth, floor, and other circumstances.\r\nOne point of proportion was mainly insisted upon and with much violence\r\nand eagerness urged on both sides, which was the square of the ship’s\r\nflat in the midships, they affirming constantly upon their oath it was\r\nfull thirteen feet, we as constantly insisting that it was but eleven\r\nfoot eight inches.” In the end the king called in a mathematician and\r\nhad the controversy settled by actual measurement. None of the charges\r\nbrought against him being sustained, Phineas was acquitted and restored\r\nonce more to royal favour, to his own delight and to that of his\r\nyouthful patron, Prince Henry.\r\n\r\nThe _Prince Royal_ marks a new epoch in ship design. She was such a\r\ndeparture from all previous forms that she made the fame of Phineas\r\nPett secure. She became, indeed, the parent or type of all future\r\nwarships down to the beginning of the nineteenth century; for (says\r\nCharnock), were the profuse ornaments removed, her contour, or general\r\nappearance, would not so materially differ from that of the modern\r\nvessel of the same size as to render her an uncommon sight, or a ship\r\nin which mariners would hesitate to take the sea. In her a final\r\ndeparture was made from the archaic form imposed on fighting ships by\r\ntradition. The picture Charnock gives of her is of a highly ornamented\r\nbut low and flush-decked vessel armed to the ends with two tiers of\r\nheavy guns. The projecting beak-head, a relic from the galley days\r\nwhich had been so prominent a feature of Tudor construction, has\r\nalmost disappeared: the bow curves gracefully upward to a lion close\r\nunder the bowsprit. The wales have little sheer; the stern is compact\r\nand well supported, with beautiful lines. The quarter galleries are\r\nlong, and are incorporated in the structure in a curious manner:\r\nin the form of indented, tower-like projections, with ornamented\r\ninterspaces. The whole picture gives evidence of stout scantlings and\r\ninvaluable solidity. Although in many respects the _Prince Royal_\r\nwas a masterpiece she was primitive in the variety of her armament.\r\nOn the lower deck she carried two cannon-petro, six demi-cannon,\r\ntwelve culverins; on her upper deck eighteen demi-culverins; and\r\non quarter-deck and poop a number of sakers and port-pieces. Also,\r\nunfortunately, she was built of green timber, so her life was short.\r\n\r\nIn building a ship of unprecedented burthen Pett had the support of\r\na large public opinion. The advantages attaching to large size were\r\nby this time generally appreciated: in the case of fighting ships, in\r\nrespect of strength, artillery force, and sea endurance, in the case\r\nof merchant ships, in respect of carrying capacity and economy of\r\ncrew. The growth in the size of merchant shipping during the reign was\r\nindeed remarkable. Trade followed the flag, and the Jacobean merchant\r\nmade haste to profit by the conquests of the Elizabethan adventurer.\r\nFor a short while after the war with Spain our mercantile marine was\r\nstagnant; at the accession of James I only small vessels of less than\r\na hundred tons were being built, and English merchants were having\r\nstrange recourse to the hiring of foreigners. But this state of\r\nthings did not last for long. The story of the success of the Earl of\r\nCumberland and his 800-ton _Scourge of Malice_, and the sight of the\r\ngreat Portuguese carrack captured in 1592, are said to have stimulated\r\nthe merchants of London to possess themselves of vessels fit for the\r\nEastern trade. It is said, again, that the appearance of two large\r\nDutch ships in the Thames supplied the sudden impulse to build big.\r\nBe that as it may, “the idea spread like wild-fire.” Larger ships\r\nwere laid down, and by the end of the reign the country possessed a\r\nconsiderable fleet of ships of 500 tons and above. In one instance,\r\nat least, the pendulum swung too far, and experience soon exposed the\r\ndisadvantages of excessive dimensions: the reduction in strength, the\r\nunhandiness in shallow waters, the almost impossibility of graving and\r\nbreaming, the risking in a single bottom of too great a venture. The\r\n_Trades Increase_, built for the new East India Company in 1605 by\r\nWilliam Burrell and launched by the king at Deptford, was of no less\r\nthan 1,100 tons burthen. On her first voyage to Java she was lost by\r\nfire, and no more ships of her size were ordered by the Company.\r\n\r\nWith the expansion of merchant shipping and with the recognition of\r\nartillery as the main instrument of naval warfare fighting ships made\r\na corresponding advance in size. The Commission of Reform of 1618,\r\non whose report the subsequent reorganization of the Navy was based,\r\nheld that the primacy of the big gun had at last been established.\r\n“Experience teacheth,” the Commissioners recorded, “how sea-fights\r\nin these days come seldom to boarding, or to great execution of\r\nbows, arrows, small shot and the sword, but are chiefly performed\r\nby the great artillery breaking down masts, yards, tearing, raking,\r\nand bilging the ships, wherein the great advantage of His Majesty’s\r\nnavy must carefully be maintained by appointing such a proportion of\r\nordnance to each ship as the vessel will bear.” They recognized the\r\nextravagance of small ships, and advised that in future the royal\r\nnavy should consist of a nucleus of about thirty large ships, which\r\nwith the merchant fleet should form one complete service; royal ships\r\nof over 800 tons; great ships of over 600 tons; middling ships of\r\nabout 450 tons. They also formulated the chief requirements of naval\r\nconstruction in considerable detail. This pontifical pronouncement\r\non ship dimensions was doubtless of value in connection with the\r\ncontemporary project to which their work had reference; nevertheless it\r\nformed a dangerous precedent for future administrations. It shackled\r\nthe genius of the shipbuilder. It degraded design. The ship, especially\r\nthe timber-built sailing warship, was essentially a compromise between\r\na number of conflicting elements. To obtain full value from his skill\r\nthe designer required as free as possible a choice of means to his end;\r\nand any over-drawing of the specification, or surplusage of data beyond\r\nthe barest requirements, tended to tie his hands and render impossible\r\na satisfactory design. It was this over-specifying of dimensions in\r\nthe interests of standardization which, as we shall presently see,\r\nstultified shipbuilding in England not only in the seventeenth but\r\nthroughout the whole of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut the report of 1618 was doubtless of great value as a guidance for\r\nthe building of the new Stuart navy. “The manner of building, which\r\nin ships of war is of greatest importance, because therein consists\r\nboth their sailing and force. The ships that can sail best can take or\r\nleave (as they say), and use all advantages the winds and seas afford;\r\nand their mould, in the judgment of men of best skill, both dead and\r\nalive, should have the length treble the breadth, and the breadth in\r\nlike proportion to the depth, but not to draw above 16 foot of water\r\nbecause deeper ships are seldom good sailers.... They must be somewhat\r\nsnug built, without double galleries and too lofty upper works, which\r\novercharge many ships and make them loom fair, but not work well at\r\nsea.” As for the strengthening of the royal ships the Commissioners\r\nsubscribed to the manner of building approved by “our late worthy\r\nprince”: “first, in making three orlops, whereof the lowest being two\r\nfeet under water, both strengtheneth the ship, and though her sides be\r\nshot through, keepeth it from bilging by shot and giveth easier means\r\nto find and stop the leaks. Second, in carrying their orlops whole\r\nfloored throughout from end to end. Third, in laying the second orlop\r\nat such convenient height that the ports may bear out the whole fire of\r\nordnance in all seas and weathers. Fourth, in placing the cook-rooms\r\nin the forecastle, as other ships of war do, because being in the\r\nmidships, and in the hold, the smoke and heat so search every corner\r\nand seam, that they make the oakum spew out, and the ships leaky,\r\nand some decay; besides, the best room for stowage of victualling is\r\nthereby so taken up, that transporters must be hired for every voyage\r\nof any time; and, which is worst, when all the weight must be cast\r\nbefore and abaft, and the ships are left empty and light in the midst,\r\nit makes them apt to sway in the back, as the _Guardland_ and divers\r\nothers have done.”\r\n\r\nThe ships built under the regulations of the Commissioners were\r\ncertainly an improvement on earlier ships in many respects, but in\r\none element of power they proved to be deficient, namely, in speed.\r\nThe stoutly built, full-bodied, lumbering English two-deckers were\r\nout-sailed and out-manœuvred, it was noticed, by the relatively light\r\nand fine-lined Hollanders. Moreover our smaller ships were known to\r\nbe no match in speed for the Dunkirk privateers which at this time\r\ninfested the seas. A new type was seen to be necessary. The existing\r\ndifferentiation of warships into rates or classes was insufficient. For\r\nthe line of battle there must be ships in which force of artillery was\r\nthe predominant quality; but for other duties there must also be ships\r\nin which speed, and not force, was the distinguishing note. From this\r\nnecessity was evolved the _frigate_.\r\n\r\nSoon after the accession of Charles I an attempt was made to establish\r\nthe new type by building small vessels on the model of the largest,\r\nminiatures which it was hoped would prove good sailors and capable,\r\nalthough square-sailed, of sailing near a wind. The Ten Whelps were\r\nlaid down: flush-decked three-masted vessels of 200 tons, 62 feet long\r\non the keel and 25 feet in breadth. They were not a success. It was\r\nleft for Dunkirk, “the smartest dockyard in Europe,” to found the new\r\nmodel. In imitation of a captured Dunkirk privateer our first frigate\r\nwas built in 1646 by Peter, son of Phineas Pett, and her success was\r\nsuch that he had the achievement recorded on his tomb. The _Constant\r\nWarwick_ was 85 feet in keel-length, 26 feet 5 inches in breadth,\r\nof 315 tons burden and 32 guns. She was “an incomparable sailer.”\r\nBefore the first Dutch war was over she had taken as much money from\r\nprivateers as would have completely laden her.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the prestige of his name was sufficient to give\r\nPeter Pett a freedom from interference in his design which was not\r\naccorded less distinguished shipbuilders. In ’45 Andrews Burrell, in\r\na remonstance addressed to Parliament, protested, “For the love of\r\nheaven let not the shipwrights that are to build them [three frigates\r\nfor special service] be misled by those that would, but cannot, direct\r\nthem, which error hath been very hurtful to the navy heretofore.” By\r\nthe interference of Sir John Pennington, he asserted, the builders\r\nof the Ten Whelps were so misled that they proved sluggish and\r\nunserviceable. “Let no rules be given the shipwrights more than their\r\ntonnage, with the number and weight of their ordnance, and that the\r\nnumber and weight of their ordnance may be suitable to the burden of\r\neach frigate.”\r\n\r\nKing Charles, whose personal interest in the royal navy equalled that\r\nof his father, favoured the tendency to enlarge the tonnage and the\r\nindividual power of his fighting ships. The _Prince Royal_ displayed\r\nthe advantages of size. The Dutch people, jealous of the interference\r\nwith their eastern trade, were known to be building large ships. Across\r\nthe channel an ambitious and all-powerful minister was envisaging\r\nthe possession of a navy in which an inferiority in numbers might be\r\nneutralized by the superiority of the unit. In France a vessel of 1400\r\ntons had been laid down. Charles determined to take up the challenge,\r\nobtaining the money by hook or by crook wherewith to build a greater.\r\nIn the year 1634 the decision was made. A model of a great three-decker\r\nmounting a hundred and four guns was presented to him by Phineas Pett,\r\nand shortly afterwards the master of the shipwrights received the royal\r\ncommand to build a ship, and to proceed in person to the forests of\r\nDurham to select the thickstuff, knee timber, and planking requisite\r\nfor the task.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the building of such a prodigious vessel appeared from\r\ndifferent quarters. Great ships, in the opinion of Sir Walter Raleigh,\r\nwere “of marvellous charge and fearful cumber.” The cost of so large a\r\nship must needs be great, for not only the whole cost, but the cost per\r\nton, increased with the size of the vessel; so wasteful a process was\r\nthe building of a great ship, indeed, that it was not unusual to build\r\na small ship simultaneously, out of the timber discarded: a practice\r\nknown as “building a small ship out of a great one’s chips.” Ships\r\nof the greatest size, again, were “of little service, less nimble,\r\nless mainable, and very seldom employed.” Nor was it believed that so\r\nlarge a vessel as that projected could be built. Trinity House, when\r\nthey heard of the design, uttered a formal protest. Such a ship, they\r\nargued, would be too big for service, and unsafe from her enormous\r\nsize. To carry such a number of pieces she must be a three-decker, and\r\nto build a serviceable three-decker was beyond the art or wit of man;\r\nif the lower tier were too low they would be useless in a sea, if at 5\r\nor 5½ feet above the water-line then the third tier would be so high\r\nas to endanger the ship. In spite of this protest the new ship was\r\nlaid down, and nearly two years later, in the autumn of ’37, she was\r\nlaunched at Woolwich, “the pride and glory of the Caroline navy.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sovereign of the Seas_, the _Sovereign_, or the _Royal Sovereign_,\r\nas she was called by successive governments, was another great advance\r\nin size and solidity on all preceding construction, and was the\r\nmasterpiece of Phineas Pett. Her length by the keel was 128 feet,\r\nher main breadth 48 feet, her overall length 232 feet. She had three\r\nflush decks and a forecastle, a half-deck, a quarter-deck, and a\r\nroundhouse. Her armament showed an approach to symmetry; the lower\r\ntier consisted of cannon and demi-cannon, the middle tier of culverins\r\nand demi-culverins. In one respect she was less advanced than Pett’s\r\nearlier effort, the _Prince Royal_, in that she had an old-fashioned\r\nbeakhead, low hawses and a low and exposed forecastle. In general\r\nform she was extolled by all, and bore witness to the genius of her\r\ndesigner. No better form, said a later critic and constructor[14] after\r\nmaking an analysis of her lines--no better form could have been devised\r\nfor a ship built (according to the prevailing customs of the times)\r\nso high out of water and so overloaded with ornaments. The king took\r\na personal pride in her, and during her construction visited Woolwich\r\nand “seriously perused all the ship within board.” For him an elaborate\r\ndescription was written which, quoted at length by various writers,\r\nserves to show the extent to which mere decoration contributed to the\r\ncost of a royal ship. Two pictures of the vessel are reproduced by\r\nCharnock, of such obvious disparity that they serve to show (as the\r\nauthor observes) to what a degree artists may differ in the presentment\r\nof the same vessel. They confirm, besides, the profuseness of the\r\nornamentation which was massed on her--the trophies, angels, emblems,\r\nmouldings--which made her the occasion of loud complaints against\r\nship-money, and “a miracle of black and gold.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sovereign of the Seas_ had a distinguished career. When cut down\r\na deck she proved to be an exceptionally serviceable unit, taking part\r\nin all the great actions of the Dutch wars and crowning her work at La\r\nHogue, where she engaged, crippled, and forced to fly for shallow water\r\nthe great _Soleil Royal_, 104, the French flagship. At length, when\r\nlaid up at Chatham in 1696 in order to be rebuilt, she was set on fire\r\nby negligence and destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nBy the outbreak of the first Dutch war the modern ideas introduced\r\nby Phineas Pett had received a general embodiment in the navy. Blake\r\nfound to his hand ships well suited to the intended warfare, nor was\r\nhe much concerned to add either to their number or their magnitude.\r\nOnly in one feature did the new vessels built show any difference from\r\nolder construction: their depth in hold was reduced, probably to render\r\nthem more suitable for work among the shallow waters of the coast of\r\nHolland.[15] In other important respects improvement had preceded the\r\nopening of hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe lofty stern with which it had been the custom to endow the sailing\r\nship was a feature which had survived from ancient times. In the\r\ngalley, whose armament was concentrated in the bows, the after part\r\nwas not devoted to military fittings, but was appropriated chiefly to\r\nthe accommodation of the officers. So it was in the galleon or sailing\r\nship. With the desire and need for increased accommodation the extra\r\nspace was obtained by prolonging aft the broad horizontal lines of the\r\nvessel and terminating them in a square frame. To give more space,\r\nquarter galleries were then added, outside the vessel. Then extra tiers\r\nof cabins were added, also with quarter galleries, each storey, as in\r\nthe case of domestic architecture, projecting over that beneath it,\r\nand the whole forming, with its surmounting taffrails, lanterns and\r\nornaments, an excessively weighty and top-heavy structure. Similarly,\r\nat the fore end of the ship there remained the survival of the ancient\r\nforecastle.\r\n\r\nWith the acceptance of artillery as the medium for battle, with the\r\ndecay of boarding tactics and the decline in value of small man-killing\r\nfirearms, close-fights and end-castles, the lofty forecastles and\r\nsterns ceased to possess much of their special value. The arguments\r\nof Sir Richard Hawkins’ day in favour of large cage-works no longer\r\nheld; nor could the preference of some shipbuilders for high sterns, as\r\nallowing a quick sheer and thereby contributing to the girder strength\r\nof the hull, be considered sufficient to justify their retention. The\r\nstern galleries held a great deal of wind and tended to rot the decks\r\nin their vicinity; their weight put a strain upon the supporting keel;\r\nbut, chiefly, the danger of their taking fire in action induced the\r\nauthorities to cut them down. For similar reasons the forecastles were\r\nattacked. But there was strong opposition to their elimination, because\r\nof the cover which they afforded in a fight. In 1652 the _Phœnix_,\r\none of the finest frigates in the service, was taken by a Dutch ship,\r\n“having no forecastle for her men to retire to.” In the second Dutch\r\nwar experience confirmed their usefulness. “All the world,” wrote Mr.\r\nSecretary Pepys in his diary for the 4th July, 1666, “now sees the use\r\nof forecastles for the shelter of men.”\r\n\r\nNo general increase in the size of our ships took place till toward the\r\nend of the third Dutch war. Until that time the navy of France was a\r\nnegligible quantity; in 1664, it is said, the only war-vessel at Brest\r\nwas one old fireship. The Dutch, our only strong opponents, fought in\r\nships not unlike our own, stout, buoyant vessels mounting from 24 to\r\n60 guns, and of from 300 to 1200 tons burden. Geography had a curious\r\ninfluence on their construction. Owing to the shallowness of their\r\ncoasts the Hollanders built their ships with less draught and flatter\r\nfloors than those of other countries; from which policy they derived\r\nadvantages of a greater carrying capacity and, in pursuit, an ability\r\nto retreat among the shallows; but on account of which they suffered a\r\nserious handicap in the hour of action, when, faced by English ships\r\nbuilt of superior material and with finer bottoms which enabled them to\r\nhold a better wind, they were weathered and out-fought.[16]\r\n\r\nThere was no apparent advantage, therefore, in augmenting the size of\r\nour ships. Improvement was sought, rather, from a further unification\r\nof the calibres of the guns, and from an increase in the number\r\ncarried. Their characteristics of shortness and large bore were such as\r\nto make them well-suited to the form of battle now favoured by English\r\nleaders--the close-quarter action.\r\n\r\nIn solidity of construction the English ships compared favourably with\r\nthose of the Dutch. The thick scantlings introduced by Phineas Pett\r\nnow proved of great value; the wood itself, tough English oak, was\r\nunequalled by any other timber. English oak was the best, as Fuller\r\nnoted. Even the Dutch had built some of their ships of it; while other\r\ncountries frequently built of inferior fir, the splinters of which\r\nkilled more than were hit by hostile cannon balls. To what was the\r\nsuperiority of the English timber due? To the soil and climate of\r\nthis favoured country. Under the influence of successions of warmth\r\nand cold, of rain and sunshine, frost and wind, all in a degree most\r\nfavourable for alternate growth and consolidation, the English oak\r\nattained an unrivalled strength and durability. Trees planted in\r\nforests, where mutual protection was afforded from wind and cold,\r\ngrew rapidly, but were inferior in quality to trees planted in small\r\nparcels or along the hedgerows; these latter, slow-growing and tough,\r\nfelled “at the wane of the moon and in the deep of winter,” supplied\r\nthe thickstuff, knees, and planking for generations of our royal ships.\r\nTheir endurance was frequently remarkable. The bottom timbers would\r\nlast for fifty or sixty years, but the upper works, which were subject\r\nto alternations of heat and cold, dryness and moisture, decayed in a\r\nmuch shorter space of time. The _Royal William_ is quoted by Charnock\r\nas a case in point. This first rate ship was launched in the year\r\n1719, and never received any material repair until 1757. A few years\r\nlater she was cut down to a third rate of 80 guns. Participating in\r\nall the sea wars of the time, she was surveyed in 1785 and converted\r\ninto a guardship, which post she filled till early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.[17]\r\n\r\nMuch attention, as we have noted, was given in this scientifically\r\nminded Stuart age to the form of body best suited to motion through\r\nwater, but the efforts to improve design were largely misdirected.\r\nMany of our ships were unsatisfactory, not only from their slowness\r\nbut because they were crank or tender-sided, and unable to bear out\r\ntheir lower guns or even to carry a stout sail. They were so clogged\r\nwith timbers internally that they could not carry the victuals and\r\nstores necessary for long voyages; and vessels built by contract were\r\noften found to be carelessly put together, of green, unseasoned, and\r\nunsuitable timber.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration the mantle of the Petts descended on a master\r\nshipwright of Portsmouth, who became an authoritative exponent of ship\r\ndesign, and to whose ability several improvements were due. “Another\r\ngreat step and improvement to our navy,” recorded Mr. Pepys in 1665,\r\n“put in practice by Sir Anthony Deane, was effected in the _Warspight_\r\nand _Defiance_, which were to carry six months’ provisions, and their\r\nguns four and a half feet from the water.” In the same diary for 19th\r\nMay of the following year occurs the following characteristic note:\r\n“Mr. Deane did discourse about his ship the _Rupert_, which succeeds\r\nso well, as he has got great honour by it; and I some, by recommending\r\nhim. The king, duke, and every body, say it is the best ship that was\r\never built. And then he fell to explain to me the manner of casting\r\nthe draught of water which a ship will draw, beforehand, which is a\r\nsecret the king and all admire in him; and he is the first that hath\r\ncome to any certainty beforehand of foretelling the draught of water\r\nof a ship, before she is launched.” The calculations used by Sir\r\nAnthony Deane to forecast the draught of a projected ship might win him\r\napplause among the philosophers; but the scoffer at theory was able to\r\npoint to considerable achievements wrought by men who made no pretence\r\nof any knowledge of science. In 1668 the _Royal Charles_, 110, was\r\nlaunched at Deptford. “She was built,” wrote Evelyn, “by old Shish, a\r\nplain, honest carpenter, master builder of this dock, but one who can\r\ngive little account of his art by discourse, and is hardly capable of\r\nreading.”\r\n\r\nThe interest of Charles II in naval architecture may be gathered from\r\na letter written by him in 1673: “I am very glad that the _Charles_\r\ndoes so well; a girdling this winter, when she comes in, will make her\r\nthe best ship in England: the next summer, if you try the two sloops\r\nthat were built at Woolwich that have my invention in them, they will\r\noutsail any of the French sloops. Sir Samuel Morland has now another\r\nfancy about weighing anchors; and the resident of Venice has made a\r\nmodel also to the same purpose.”\r\n\r\nTo girdle a ship, was to fasten planks along her sides some two or\r\nthree strakes above and below the water-line; this had the effect\r\nof adding to her beam and thereby rendering her stiffer under sail.\r\nIncessant girdling seems to have been necessary at this period,\r\nto counter the defective conditions in which English ships were\r\ndesigned, built, and sent to sea. Ships were consistently restricted\r\nin beam, in compliance with the faulty “establishments,” and under a\r\nmistaken notion that narrowness, in itself, directly contributed to\r\nspeed. “Length,” says Charnock, “was the only dimension regarded as\r\nindispensably necessary, by the ancients for their galleys and by the\r\nmoderns for galleons. Breadth was not considered, or if considered was\r\naccepted as a necessary evil.” Pepys remarked, “that the builders of\r\nEngland, before 1673, had not well considered that breadth only will\r\nmake a stiff ship.” It was an inquiry ordered by Sir Richard Haddock\r\nin 1684 which brought to light the fulness of the fallacy; ships were\r\nsubsequently made broader, and experience showed that a good breadth\r\nwas beneficial, not only for stability but for speed and sea-keeping\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nBut even if a ship were built initially broad enough, the continual\r\naddition of armament and top-hamper to which she was often subjected\r\nhad the effect eventually of impairing her stability. In such a case\r\nthere were two remedies: to ballast or to girdle. The former expedient\r\nwas objectionable, as it involved an increase both of displacement and\r\nof draught. Girdling was therefore generally practised. By this means\r\nthe vessel was made stiffer, her buoyancy was improved, and her sides\r\nwere also rendered less penetrable between wind and water. Even if,\r\nwhen thus girdled, she proved to be less stiff than the enemy this was\r\nnot altogether a disadvantage: she formed a steadier gun-platform, her\r\nsides were less strained by the sea and, because her rolling was less\r\nviolent, her topmasts were less liable to be sprung. But sufficient\r\nstiffness was necessary to allow of her lowest and heaviest tier of\r\nguns being fought in moderate weather; and for this reason alone,\r\ngirdling was preferable to ballasting, in that the former tended to\r\nkeep the guns high out of water while the latter brought them nearer\r\nthe water-line.\r\n\r\nAlthough rigidly restricted in dimensions, ships put to sea in these\r\ndays under such varying conditions that it was difficult indeed to\r\nforetell whether a vessel were seaworthy or not. A commissioner of\r\nJames the Second’s reign complained bitterly of the injudicious\r\nmanagement whereby “many a fast sailing ship have come to lose that\r\nproperty, by being over-masted, over-rigged, over-gunned (as the\r\n_Constant Warwick_, from 26 guns and an incomparable sailer, to 46\r\nguns and a slug), over-manned (_vide_ all the old ships built in\r\nthe parliament time now left), over-built (_vide_ the _Ruby_ and\r\n_Assurance_), and having great taffrails and galleries, etc., to the\r\nmaking many formerly a stiff, now a tender-sided ship, bringing thereby\r\ntheir head and tuck to lie too low in the water.”\r\n\r\nIn spite of these strictures it must be remembered that our ships\r\nhad qualities which, brought into action by brave crews and resolute\r\nleaders, served the nation well in the day of battle. In no naval\r\nwar, perhaps, did superiority of material exert such a consistent and\r\npreponderating effect as in the seventeenth century wars between this\r\ncountry and Holland.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of the English leaders involved close-quarter fighting. The\r\nmaterial, both guns and ships, certainly favoured these tactics; though\r\nto what extent tactics dictated the form of the material, or material\r\nreacted on tactics, it may be difficult to decide. In one respect\r\ntactics undoubtedly directed the evolution of the material: while\r\nthe Dutch employed a “gregarious system” of mutual support of their\r\nvessels by others of various force, fighting in groups and throwing in\r\nfireships as opportunity offered, the English always sought to match\r\nindividual ships.[18] Forming in line ahead--a formation, said to\r\nhave been first used by Tromp, which enabled our vessels to avoid the\r\nfireships--they came to close quarters in a series of duels in which\r\nthe strength and prowess of each individual ship was its only means of\r\nvictory. The success of this plan caused the Dutch to imitate it. The\r\nsize of their ships rapidly grew; their weakest units were discarded.\r\nThree-deckers were laid down, at first carrying only 76 guns, but\r\nlater, after the peace of 1674, as large as the British first rates.\r\nBut by that time the critical battles had been lost and won. And the\r\nsuccess of the British is ascribed, in Derrick’s memoirs, chiefly to\r\nthe superior size of our ships, “an advantage which all the skill of\r\nthe Dutch could not compensate.”\r\n\r\nWith the institution of the line of battle a need arose for a symmetry\r\nbetween ships which had never before existed. From this arose, not only\r\nthat more complete differentiation of force[19] which lasted through\r\nthe following century, but a still more stringent ruling of dimensions\r\naccording to “establishments,” which ruling, injudiciously applied,\r\nwas henceforth to exercise so harmful an effect on English naval\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace of 1674 the navy sank into inefficiency. The French\r\nnavy, on the other hand, ascended in power with an extraordinary\r\nrapidity. By 1681 it had expanded so much under the fostering care of\r\nM. Colbert that it comprised no fewer than one hundred and fifteen\r\nships of the line. In design, as apart from construction, French ships\r\nwere superior to ours. In size especially they had an advantage, being\r\nuniversally larger than British ships of the same artillery force: an\r\nadvantage based on the law, known to our own shipbuilders but never\r\napplied, that _the greater the dimensions of a ship, relatively to\r\nthe weight she has to carry, the better she will sail_. So superior\r\nwere some French ships which visited Spithead seen to be, that in\r\nimitation of them Sir Anthony Deane was ordered to design and build the\r\n_Harwich_; and from the plans of this ship nine others were ordered\r\nby parliament, the class constituting the greatest advance in naval\r\narchitecture of that time. But this departure from precedent had\r\nlittle effect. In dimensions as compared with tonnage we continued\r\nparsimonious. In the face of French experience we cramped our ships to\r\nthe requirements of the faulty “establishments”; and until the end of\r\nthe century no increase in size took place except in the case of some\r\nships laid down in the year 1682, when the threat of a war with Louis\r\nXIV not improbably caused them to be constructed on a more extensive\r\nscale than had ever before been in practice.\r\n\r\nIn another respect our ships were inferior in design to those of our\r\nchief rivals: in the extreme degree of “tumble home” given to their\r\nsides. Adhering to ancient practice in this particular, in order to\r\nobtain advantages which have already been mentioned, we suffered\r\nincreasingly serious disadvantages. The sides of our ships were so\r\nconvex that, when sailing on a wind, every wave was guided upward to\r\nthe upper deck, thereby keeping the crew continually wet. The deck\r\nspace required for the efficient working of the sails was contracted.\r\nMoreover, ships having this high degree of convexity were more easily\r\noverset than were wall-sided ships. This exaggerated convexity had a\r\nstriking effect on one feature of our construction, viz. the manner in\r\nwhich we affixed the chain-plates, to which the shrouds were secured,\r\nin a low position on the curve of the hull; while Holland and France\r\nraised them to a more convenient height--over the upper tier of guns,\r\nin their two-decked ships.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the horizontal lines of our ships were (in the\r\nabsence of science) cleverly moulded. The after lines in particular\r\nwere well suited for supporting the stern and at the same time allowing\r\na free run of water to the rudder; other nations, overlooking the\r\nimportance of this part of the vessel, adhered to the old-fashioned\r\nsquare tuck and stern which was a chief but unappreciated factor of the\r\nresistance to the passage of the vessel through water.\r\n\r\nWhen war actually broke out in 1689 the balance of material between\r\nEnglish and French was much the same in character as it had been\r\nbetween English and Dutch. Our fleet was once more in a seaworthy and\r\nefficient condition. Our guns were generally shorter and of larger bore\r\nthan those of the French; our ships were narrower and less able to bear\r\nout their ordnance, but their sides were thicker, and better able to\r\nwithstand the racket of gun fire. Once more, at La Hogue, the British\r\nsquadrons showed that they possessed the offensive and defensive\r\nqualities which favoured victory in close-quarter fighting; and the end\r\nof the century found the prestige of the navy at a level as high as\r\nthat to which Cromwell and Blake had brought it.\r\n\r\nIn the decade which ended in 1689 the navy had passed, on its\r\nadministrative side, “from the lowest state of impotence to the most\r\nadvanced step towards a lasting and solid prosperity.” In Pepys’ rare\r\nlittle _Memoirs_ the story of this dramatic change is told. We read\r\nhow, after five years’ governance by the commission charged by the\r\nking with the whole office of the Lord High Admiral, the navy found\r\nitself rotten to the core; how in ’85 the king resolved to take up its\r\nmanagement again, helped by his royal brother; how he sent for Mr.\r\nPepys; how at his instigation new, honest, and energetic Commissioners\r\nwere appointed, including among them the reluctant Sir Anthony Deane;\r\nhow Mr. Pepys himself strove to reorganize, how new regulations were\r\nintroduced, sea stores established, finances checked, malpractices\r\nexposed, the navy restored both in spirit and material.\r\n\r\nMr. Pepys claimed to prove that integrity and general knowledge were\r\ninsufficient, if unaccompanied by vigour, assiduity, affection,\r\nstrictness of discipline and method, for the successful conduct of a\r\nnavy; and that by the strenuous conjunction of zeal, honesty, good\r\nhusbandry and method, and not least by the employment of technical\r\nknowledge, the Royal Navy had been rendered efficient once again.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from an Essay on the Navy, printed in 1702, is\r\nhere quoted for its general significance:\r\n\r\n    “The cannon (nearly 10,000 brass and iron) are for nature and\r\n    make according to the former disposition and manner of our\r\n    mariners’ fighting (whose custom was to fight board and board,\r\n    yard-arm and yard-arm, through and through, as they termed it,\r\n    and not at a distance in the line, and a like, which practice\r\n    till of late our seniors say they were strangers to), they are\r\n    therefore much shorter and of larger bore than the French,\r\n    with whom to fight at a distance is very disadvantageous, as\r\n    has been observed in several fights of late, their balls or\r\n    bullets flying over our ships before ours could reach them by a\r\n    mile....” etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn Laputa, early in the eighteenth century, the people were so\r\nengrossed in the mathematics that the constant study of abstruse\r\nproblems had a strange and distorting effect on the whole life of the\r\nisland. Their houses were built according to such refined instructions\r\nas caused their workmen to make perpetual mistakes; their clothes were\r\ncut (and often incorrectly) by mathematical calculation; the very\r\nviands on their tables were carved into rhomboids, cycloids, cones,\r\nparallelograms, and other mathematical figures!\r\n\r\nTo most Englishmen of that time any attempt to apply science to\r\nshipbuilding must have appeared as far-fetched and grotesque as these\r\npractices of the Laputans. Ship design was still an art, veiled in\r\nmystery, its votaries guided only by blind lore and groping along\r\nan increasingly difficult path by processes of trial and error. The\r\nmethods of applied science were as yet unknown. The builder was often a\r\nmere carpenter, ignorant of mathematics and even of the use of simple\r\nplans; the savant in his quiet study and the seaman on the perilous\r\nseas lived in worlds apart from each other and from him, and could not\r\ncollaborate. Such speculative principles as the shipbuilder possessed\r\nwere almost wholly erroneous; no single curve or dimension of a ship,\r\nit is said, was founded on a rational principle. Everything was by\r\ntradition or authority. Knowledge had not yet coalesced in books.\r\nMen kept such secrets as they had in manuscript, and their want of\r\nknowledge was covered by silence and mystery. Preposterous theories\r\nwere maintained by the most able men and facts were denied or perverted\r\nso as to square with them. “Forgetful of the road pointed out by Lord\r\nBacon, who opposed a legitimate induction from well-established facts\r\nto hypothesis founded on specious conjectures, and too hastily giving\r\nup as hopeless the attainment of a theory combining experiment with\r\nestablished scientific principles, they have contented themselves with\r\ningeniously inventing _mechanical methods_ of forming the designs\r\nof ships’ bodies of arcs of circles, others of ellipses, parabolas,\r\ncatenaries--which they thought to possess some peculiar virtue and\r\nwhich they investigated with the minutest mathematical accuracy. So\r\nthey became possessed of a System. And, armed with this, they despised\r\nall rivals without one; and, trusting to it, rejected all the benefits\r\nof experiment and of sea experience.”[20]\r\n\r\nThe intervention of the philosophers had not had any appreciable\r\neffect. Sir William Petty had indeed projected a great work on the\r\ntheory of shipbuilding; he had carried out model experiments in tanks,\r\nand had invented a double-keeled vessel which, by its performances on\r\npassage between Holyhead and Dublin, had drawn public attention to his\r\ntheories.[21] In his discourse before the Royal Society on Duplicate\r\nProportions, he had opened out new and complex considerations for the\r\nshipbuilder; inviting him to forsake his golden rule, or Rule of Three,\r\nand apply the law _x varies as y²_ to numerous problems in connection\r\nwith his craft. But it could soon be shown, by a reference to current\r\npractice, that this new law could not be rigidly applied. And the\r\nshipbuilder, realizing his own limitations and jealous of sharing\r\nhis professional mysteries with mathematicians and philosophers, was\r\nwilling to laugh the new theories out of court.\r\n\r\nAgain, of what practical use had been the discovery of the “solid\r\nof least resistance” or of that “cono-cuneus” which Dr. Wallis had\r\ninvestigated with a view to its application to the bows of a ship? A\r\nfinal blow to the scientists was given when the _Royal Katherine_,\r\na three-decker of 80 guns, designed by the council of the Royal\r\nSociety, was found so deficient in stability that it was deemed\r\nnecessary to girdle her. Old Shish had beaten Sir Isaac Newton and\r\nall the professors! The impossibility of applying abstract scientific\r\nprinciples to so complex a machine as a sailing ship, moving in\r\nelements so variable as air and water, was patent to everyone. The\r\nattitude of the professional may be judged from the resigned language\r\nof William Sutherland, a shipwright of Portsmouth and Deptford Yards,\r\nwho in 1711 published his _Ship-builder’s Assistant_:\r\n\r\n“Though some of our preceding Master Builders have proposed length as\r\nexpedient to increase motion, yet it has seldom answered; much extra\r\ntimber is required to make them equally strong. Besides, if the solid\r\nof least resistance be a blunt-headed solid, extreme length will be\r\nuseless to make cutting bodies.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in connection with the dimensions of masts:\r\n\r\n“Though several writers say, that the velocities are the square roots\r\nof the power that drives or draws the body; from which it should be a\r\nquadruple sail to cause double swiftness. Hence, unless the fashion is\r\nadapted to the magnitude of the ship, all our Art can only be allowed\r\nnotional, and the safest way of building and equipping will be to go\r\nto precedent, if there be any to be found. But this is a superfluous\r\ncaution, since ’tis very customary, that let a ship be fitted never so\r\nwell by one hand, it will not suit the temper of another. Besides, the\r\nproper business of a shipwright is counted an very vulgar imploy, and\r\nwhich a man of very indifferent qualifications may be master of.”\r\n\r\nScience was, in short, discredited. The corporation of shipwrights had\r\ndisappeared, not long surviving the fall of the house of Stuart. No\r\nmaster-builder had succeeded the Petts and the Deanes having sufficient\r\ninfluence and erudition to expose the faulty system under which\r\nwarships were now built, English shipbuilding had once more become a\r\ncraft governed entirely by precedent and the regulations. The professor\r\nwas routed, and the practical man said in his heart, There is no\r\nknowing what salt water likes.\r\n\r\nYet the science of naval architecture was at the dawn. Not in this\r\ncountry, but in France, in the early part of the eighteenth century,\r\nresearch and inquiry received such encouragement from the State that it\r\nconferred on their fleets a superiority of design which they retained\r\nfor long: a superiority which enabled them, in the _guerre de course_\r\nwhich was developed after La Hogue under the intrepid leadership of men\r\nlike Jean Bart, Forbin, and Duguay-Trouin, to strike us some shrewd\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nWe propose to summarize as briefly as possible the principal events\r\nwhich mark the evolution of the scientific side of naval architecture.\r\n\r\nA mere enumeration of the names and works of the men who chiefly\r\ncontributed to the discovery of the true natural principles underlying\r\nthe performance of sailing ships would suffice to show the debt owed\r\nby the world to French effort, and the tardiness with which this\r\ncountry faced the intellectual problems involved. In the year 1681 a\r\nseries of conferences was held at Paris on the question of placing the\r\noperations of naval architecture on a stable scientific basis; but\r\nbefore that date, in 1673, Father Pardies, a Jesuit, had published the\r\nresults of his attempts to calculate the resistance of bodies moving\r\nin fluids with varying velocities. In ’93 the Chevalier Renaud and\r\nChristian Huyghens were engaged in public controversy on the merits\r\nand deficiencies of Pardies’ laws. In ’96 James Bernouilli entered\r\nthe lists on Huyghen’s side, and in the following year a remarkable\r\nwork appeared from the pen of another Jesuit, Paul Hoste, professor of\r\nmathematics at Toulon. Father Hoste, having noticed the frequency with\r\nwhich vessels of that time required girdling, had put the question,\r\nwhy they should not be built initially with the form which they had\r\nwhen ultimately girdled. The replies given him being unsatisfactory,\r\nthe professor investigated a whole series of problems: the relation\r\nbetween speed and resistance, the effect of form on resistance,\r\nstability, stowage, the properties affecting pitching, and the best\r\nform of bow. Though incorrect in much of his theory, he had admittedly\r\na great influence on later research. He was followed, in 1714, by\r\nJohn Bernouilli, professor at Basle, whose investigations were purely\r\ntheoretical. And then, a few years later, M. Bouguer made his great\r\ndiscovery of the _metacentre_, that all-important point in space whose\r\nposition in a ship, relatively to its centre of gravity, marks with\r\nprecision the nature of the vessel’s stability.\r\n\r\nA treatise by Euler, entitled _Scientia Navalis_, was published\r\nin 1749, and a little later, stimulated by prizes offered by the\r\nSociété Royale des Sciences, Don G. Juan in Spain, Euler in Russia,\r\nand Daniel Bernouilli in Germany, all published the results of their\r\ninvestigations into the forces acting on a rolling ship. Euler’s\r\ncontribution was especially valuable. Treating the ship as a pendulum\r\nhe laid down two definite rules for the guidance of shipbuilders, (1),\r\nnot to remove the parts of a ship too far from the longitudinal axis,\r\n(2), to make the most distant parts as light as possible.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the discoveries of the mathematicians had had little\r\npractical effect on shipping. The abstruse form in which new truths\r\nwere published, and the lack of education of the shipbuilders,\r\nprevented that mutual collaboration which was necessary if the art of\r\nshipbuilding was to benefit by the advances of science. Soon after\r\n1750, however, a succession of able men, possessed of imagination and\r\ninitiative, led inquiry into practical channels, and by actual trial\r\nproved, incidentally, that much of the accepted theory was faulty. The\r\nChevalier de Borda, a naval captain and a member of the Academy of\r\nSciences, investigated with models the resistance of fluids to motion\r\nthrough them, and enunciated laws which shook confidence in current\r\nbeliefs. The result was a commission from the government to three\r\neminent men, M. D’Alembert, the Marquis Condorcet and the Abbé Bossut,\r\nto report on and continue de Borda’s investigations. The report, read\r\nby the Abbé before the Academy in 1776, confirmed generally de Borda’s\r\ntheories, and revealed new problems--in particular, the alteration in\r\nshape of the free water surface and the effect of wave resistance,\r\nthe latter of which was ultimately to be solved in this country by\r\nMr. W. Froude--that required investigation. The circumstances of this\r\ncommission illustrate the enlightened interest of the State in the\r\nadvancement of knowledge, significant testimony to which was paid\r\nby Abbé Bossut. “M. Turgot,” he said of the Comptroller-General of\r\nFinances, who took responsibility for it, “who is not only an admirer\r\nof the sciences, but has pursued the study of them himself amidst his\r\nnumerous important official functions, approved of our intentions, and\r\ngranted every requisite for prosecuting them.”\r\n\r\nIn the same year curious and important discoveries were made by M.\r\nRomme, professor of navigation at La Rochelle. In an endeavour to find\r\nthe form of ship body which would give good stability in conjunction\r\nwith small resistance, he ascertained the importance of the “run” or\r\nafter part. Hitherto the form of bow had absorbed attention to the\r\nalmost entire exclusion of the form of run, except in so far as it\r\nhad been shaped to allow water to flow freely to the rudder. M. Romme\r\ncalled in aid methods which are now approved as scientific, but which\r\nwere then conspicuously novel: he experimented by comparative trials\r\nbetween models in which all variable features except one had been\r\ncarefully eliminated. He was rewarded by some new discoveries. By\r\nfixing the length and successively varying the curvature of different\r\nparts of his models he laid bare an important paradox. While at\r\nlow speeds the resistance was least when a sharp end was in front\r\nand a blunt end in rear, at higher speeds the opposite obtained.\r\nThis accounted for a great deal of the contradictions of previous\r\ninvestigators. M. Romme went further: the curves by which the bow\r\nof a ship was connected with her middle body, hitherto looked on as\r\nall-important, were shown to be relatively immaterial. He astonished\r\nthe world of science by proving that, given certain conditions, the\r\nresistance upon an arc of a curve is the same as that upon the chord of\r\nthis arc. His deductions were proved by commissions to be well founded.\r\nExperience confirmed that the form of the bow curve did not much\r\ninfluence the resistance experienced in passing through water; on the\r\nother hand the form of the run was shown to have a far greater effect\r\nthan had hitherto been suspected.\r\n\r\nIn the year before M. Romme published the results of his experiments a\r\ntreatise appeared, full of empirical rules and shrewd reasoning, by one\r\nof the greatest naval architects, Henry de Chapman, chief constructor\r\nof the Swedish navy, an Anglo-Swede who came of an old shipbuilding\r\nfamily of Deptford. Chapman was a most gifted shipbuilder. Though his\r\nformulæ were empirical, they were founded on careful observation and\r\ninduction, and his name ranks with those of Phineas Pett and Anthony\r\nDeane in the history of naval architecture.\r\n\r\nNothing, so far, had come from English writers. “The only English\r\ntreatise on shipbuilding that can lay any claim to a scientific\r\ncharacter was published by Mungo Murray in 1754; and he, though his\r\nconduct was irreproachable, lived and died a working shipwright in\r\nDeptford dockyard.”[22] But indifference was at last giving place to\r\ninterest. Inspired by the formation of the Society of Arts in 1753\r\n(which Society was itself inspired by the recognition, on the part of\r\nthe founder, of the value of prizes and rewards in improving our breed\r\nof racehorses) a London bookseller named Sewell succeeded in 1791 in\r\nforming a Society for the Improvement of Naval Architecture. “Impressed\r\nwith the many grave complaints which reached him as to the inferiority\r\nof our warships as compared with those of France and Spain,” he gained\r\nthe interest of Lord Barham and other influential men. A meeting was\r\nheld at which it was decided, as something of a novelty, that the\r\ntheory and art of shipbuilding were subjects of national importance;\r\nthat a radical deficiency in knowledge of the same existed; and that\r\nthe most effective remedy was a focussing of the wisdom of the country\r\non this matter by the institution of the above Society.[23]\r\n\r\nFor a time the society flourished. A learned paper by Atwood before the\r\nRoyal Society, on the stability of a rolling ship, proved that this\r\ncountry was not wholly destitute of mathematical talent. An interesting\r\nseries of experiments was carried out for it by Colonel Beaufoy, a\r\ndevoted student who had made his first experiments on water resistance\r\nbefore he was fifteen years old. It appears that his attention was\r\nfirst drawn to the subject by hearing an eminent mathematician state\r\none evening that a cone drawn through water base foremost experienced\r\nless resistance than with its apex foremost; and it was said that\r\nsailors always took a mast in tow by the heel. The paradox excited\r\nyoung Beaufoy’s curiosity. Before bedtime, with the assistance of a\r\nneighbouring turner, he was making experiments in one of the coolers in\r\nhis father’s brew-house, a large bunch of counting-house keys being put\r\ninto requisition as a motive power. Though the society was dissolved in\r\n1799 Beaufoy continued to pursue this subject with unabated zeal until\r\nhis death. In one direction, especially, he did good work. Attracted by\r\nthe frequency with which North Sea fishing vessels, fitted with wells\r\nfor carrying the fish, foundered at sea, he showed experimentally the\r\nloss of stability involved in carrying open tanks of water. He also\r\ndemonstrated to English builders by means of models that Bouguer’s\r\ndiagram of metacentric stability was of great practical value, even for\r\nlarge angles of heel. “His experiments,” says Mr. Johns, “should take\r\nan important place in the history of stability of ships.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nWe now revert to the beginning of the eighteenth century. In the\r\ndesultory warfare which was carried on during the reign of Queen\r\nAnne events occurred to demonstrate the superiority in design of the\r\nFrench warship over its English opponent of the same nominal force.\r\nOne in particular, an expedition under Count Forbin which was intended\r\nto cover a descent on the Scotch coast in favour of the Pretender,\r\n“showed, even in failure, that in material France held a lead on us.”\r\nChased back to its ports from the latitude of Edinburgh by larger\r\nEnglish forces, Forbin’s squadron proved a superiority over all our\r\nships, both in speed and seaworthiness. In weather which disabled many\r\nof our vessels the French squadron arrived home with the loss of only\r\nthree--and these all English built.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time the capture by us of a 60-gun ship, the _Maure_,\r\nof extraordinarily large dimensions for her rate, showed the direction\r\nin which French design differed from our own. The recapture, not long\r\nafterwards, of the _Pembroke_, which was now found to carry only fifty,\r\ninstead of her original number of sixty-four guns, corroborated (says\r\nCharnock) the direction in which improvement was sought and found.\r\n\r\nBut for some time the lesson remained unlearnt. For a number of years\r\nthe inferiority of our design was an accepted fact; “every action won\r\nby British valour was a stigma to British science.” Throughout the\r\nwhole of this century we set no value on scientific principles as\r\napplied to naval architecture, and were content to remain copyists.\r\nAlthough before the advent of the Napoleonic wars we had thus\r\nendeavoured to reduce their balance of advantage, yet even so the\r\nFrench still maintained an absolute superiority in design. In the\r\nfirst half of the century this superiority was especially conspicuous;\r\nand, in conjunction with an inferiority of seamanship and workmanship\r\nwhich in the end more than neutralized all its advantages, it was the\r\ncause of the disreputable incongruities which Charnock has depicted\r\nin his well-known epigram: _Very few ships captured by the enemy from\r\nthe British have ever continued long the property of their possessors.\r\nIf it has so happened, that one of them, being in company with others\r\nof French construction, has ever fallen in with any English squadron,\r\nthat ship, almost without exception, has been among those captured,\r\nand most frequently the first which has fallen. On the other hand, the\r\nrecapture of any ship from the British, which was originally French, is\r\na circumstance extremely uncommon. Captured French ships were sought\r\nfor as the best commands, which not infrequently were the means of\r\nrecapturing captured English vessels._\r\n\r\nVery seldom was our failure to overhaul the speedy Frenchman attributed\r\nto inferiority of design; nearly always to the fortuitous circumstance\r\nthat we were foul-bottomed and the enemy clean; which may have been\r\nsometimes true, but which was evidently a partial and inaccurate\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nWe have already made mention of the periodic “establishments” of\r\ndimensions to which ships built for the royal navy were made to\r\nconform. The first of these, after the rules laid down by the\r\ncommissioners of James I, was decreed in 1655, when Blake was\r\norganizing a new standard navy. In 1677 dimensions were established for\r\nships of 100, 90, and 70 guns, but were exceeded in the case of those\r\nships which were actually built; and in ’91 a revised establishment for\r\nall classes, very similar to those which previously governed practice,\r\nappeared. In 1706 a new establishment was decreed, a compromise between\r\nthe ideas of the Surveyor and the master shipwrights, in which the\r\ndimensions of each class were slightly increased. The dimensions still\r\nremained small compared with those of all foreign ships, however, and\r\nstill “all superior faculties of sailing were attributed to the mere\r\nlength of the vessel itself, without any but trivial regard to shape or\r\nform of bottom.” Assuming that the ships built under this establishment\r\nderived some slight advantage over earlier construction on account of\r\ntheir augmented tonnage, yet this was nullified when, in 1716, the\r\nforce of their armament was raised. As the work of a committee presided\r\nover by Admiral Byng, a new establishment of guns was ordered, a change\r\nbeing made in calibres but not in numbers:--\r\n\r\nFirst and second rates, instead of carrying 32-pounders on the lower,\r\n18-pounders on the main, and 9-pounders on the upper deck, were ordered\r\nto carry, 42-pounders (or 32-pounders) on the lower, 24-pounders\r\non the main, and 12-pounders on the upper deck. Eighty-gun ships,\r\ninstead of carrying 24-pounders on the lower, 12-pounders on the main,\r\nand 6-pounders on the upper deck, were ordered to carry 32-pounders\r\non the lower, 12-pounders on the main, and 6-pounders on the upper\r\ndeck. Seventy-gun ships, which in the previous century had carried\r\n18-pounders on their main, and 9-pounders on their upper deck, and\r\nwhich during the reign of Queen Anne had carried 24-pounders and\r\n9-pounders, were now ordered to carry 24-pounders and 12-pounders. And\r\nso on with the smaller rates.\r\n\r\nIn 1719 a new establishment for ships was decreed, the dimensions\r\nslightly exceeding those of 1706, but being totally insufficient\r\nfor satisfactory construction. In ’32 and ’41 attempts were made to\r\nformulate new rules; but the master shipwrights seem to have been loth\r\nto accept the lesson which the French enemy was teaching them, and\r\nhesitated to recommend any radical departure from traditional practice.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1745, general complaint of the inferiority of our\r\nships in size and scantlings forced improvement on the authorities.\r\nSpain, who had joined France in war against us, possessed ships which\r\nexceeded in size even French ships of the same rate. The capture in\r\n1740 of a Spanish 70-gun ship, the _Princessa_, by three of our ships,\r\nnominally of equal force with herself but of far inferior dimensions\r\nand scantlings, is said to have been the chief cause of the new reform.\r\nTheir lordships of the Admiralty, surveying naval construction in\r\nthis country, noted that our royal ships were weak and crank, while\r\nthose of other nations went upright. There was no uniform standard\r\nof size, ships of the same class were of different dimensions, the\r\nexisting establishment was not adhered to. They therefore decided on a\r\nnew establishment, based on the latest armament of guns; which should\r\nresult in ships which would carry their lower tier six feet above the\r\nwater, and four months’ provisions.\r\n\r\nThe new standard was of little avail, for the same error made some\r\nthirty years previously was now repeated: with the augmentation of the\r\nship dimensions the armament was also raised in calibre. The first\r\nrates were ordered to carry the 42-pounder (which had before been\r\noptional) on their lower deck; the 90-gun ships, 12-pounders on their\r\nupper decks; the eighties, 18-pounders and 9-pounders instead of 12’s\r\nand 6’s; the seventies, which were only two hundred tons in excess of\r\nthe former establishment, 32-pounders and 18-pounders, instead of 24’s\r\nand 12’s. “The ships, therefore, built by this establishment proved, in\r\ngeneral, very crank and bad sea-boats.”[24]\r\n\r\nThis establishment was, in point of fact, little adhered to. The war\r\nwith France during the years 1744-8 repeatedly revealed the defective\r\nnature of our ship design. Experience pointed to the necessity either\r\nof reduced gun-weights or of larger ships. Able administrators were\r\nnow willing, under the inspiration of such names as Hawke and Anson,\r\nto initiate improvements. Our naval architecture at last took benefit,\r\nthough still by slow and cautious degrees, from foreign experience.\r\nSome time was necessary for results to show themselves; not only were\r\nnew decisions slowly formed, but the rate of building was deliberately\r\nslow. The _Royal George_, for instance, described as “the first\r\nattempt towards emancipation from the former servitude,” was ten years\r\nbuilding. But, when war broke out again in 1756, the improvements\r\nalready embodied in the newest construction proved of considerable\r\nbenefit. The establishment of ’45 was given the credit. “The ships\r\nbuilt by the establishment of 1745,” says Derrick in his Memoirs, “were\r\nfound to carry their guns well, and were stiff ships, but they were\r\nformed too full in their after part; and in the war which took place\r\nin 1756, or a little before, some further improvements in the draughts\r\nwere therefore adopted, and the dimensions of the ships were also\r\nfurther increased.”\r\n\r\nTo meet the advances in French construction a new classification\r\nof rates took place, with French captured ships as models. The\r\ncapture of the _Foudroyant_, for instance, in 1758, provided us with\r\nthe form and dimensions of a splendid two-decked 84-gun ship. Our\r\n80-gun three-deckers were thereupon abolished, and no three-decker\r\nwas thenceforth built with fewer than 90 guns. The capture of the\r\n_Invincible_, in 1757, gave us a valuable model for a 74-gun ship, a\r\nrate highly esteemed, which bore the brunt of most of this century’s\r\nwarfare.[25] From her was copied the _Triumph_, and other experimental\r\n74’s, with dimensions varying from those of the _Invincible_, were\r\nat this time laid down. All 50-gun ships had already dropped out of\r\nthe line of battle; they were now followed by the 60’s. No more 60\r\nor 70-gun ships were built; their places were taken by 64’s and 74’s\r\nrespectively, of relatively large size and displacement.\r\n\r\nNor was improvement confined to form and dimensions. Attention was now\r\npaid to material. New rules were made for the cutting and seasoning\r\nof timber, and for its economical use. Sheathing was tried; in 1761\r\nthe frigate _Alarm_ was sheathed in copper for service in the West\r\nIndies, where the worm was active. The copper was found to keep clean\r\nthe hull, but at the expense of the iron fastenings; so when, in ’83,\r\ncopper sheathing became general, an order was issued for all new royal\r\nships to be copper fastened up to the water-line: an order beneficial\r\non another count, since even without the presence of copper sheathing,\r\niron bolts had always been liable to corrosion from the acids contained\r\nin the oak timbers. Ventilation was also studied, more for its effects\r\non the hull timbers than on the health of the crews. The scantlings\r\nof all ships were strengthened. Taffrails and quarter-pieces were\r\nreduced in size, and the weight thus saved was devoted to strengthening\r\nthe sterns and reinforcing the deck supports; additional knees and\r\nfastenings were provided throughout the structure. Moreover, towards\r\nthe middle of the century the formation of the sails was gradually\r\naltered, first in the smaller rates and afterwards in the larger ships.\r\nThe old-fashioned spritsail, which had been of greatest effect when\r\ngoing free, but which had also been used with the wind abeam by the\r\nawkward expedient of topping up its yard, gave place in our navy to the\r\nfore and aft jib, which could be used with the wind before the beam.\r\nLater the lateen sail on the mizzen gave place to a spanker hung from a\r\ngaff or half-yard. These alterations had a general effect on the size\r\nand position of masts and sails.\r\n\r\nThe order of 1745 was virtually the last of those rule-of-thumb\r\nestablishments which had imposed rigorous maximum limits of length,\r\nbeam and draught in conjunction with an equally rigorous minimum of\r\narmament weight, and which had been a glaring example of the evil\r\neffects of standardization when unscientifically and unsuitably\r\napplied. The East India service, the contract-built ships of which\r\nwere designed by architects untrammelled by the rules which cramped\r\nand distorted the official architecture, provided the clearest proof\r\nthat the King’s ships were, as a whole, of poor design. Naval opinion\r\nconfirmed it.[26]\r\n\r\nFor further evidence that it was the system and not the men at fault,\r\nwe may note Charnock’s statement that, given a free hand, Englishmen\r\nproved themselves better shipbuilders than foreigners. “It stamps\r\nno inconsiderable degree of splendour on the opinion which even the\r\narrogance of Spain felt itself compelled to hold in regard to the\r\nsuperior practical knowledge possessed by the British shipwrights in\r\nthe construction and art of putting a vessel together, when brought in\r\ncomparison with that of their own people. The builders in all the royal\r\ndockyards and arsenals, the Havanna excepted, were Britons.”\r\n\r\nHow many, we may wonder, of the ships shattered by Lord Nelson at\r\nTrafalgar were constructed by our countrymen? The _Victory_, which was\r\nto bear his flag, was laid down (we may note in passing) in the year\r\n1759: she was 186 feet in length on the gun-deck, 52 feet broad, and of\r\n2,162 tons burthen.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 the American war broke out. The colonists, who possessed a\r\nsmall but efficient frigate navy, were joined soon afterwards by\r\nFrance, and then by Spain, and Holland. Lord Rodney acknowledged the\r\nsuperiority of the French in speed, who, though his ships were equally\r\nclean with theirs, yet had the power daily to bring on an action. The\r\nwar proved a rough test for our honest but unscientific construction.\r\n“In 1778, assailed by numerous enemies, England put forth all her\r\nnaval strength. Powerful fleets had to be found simultaneously for the\r\nChannel, the North Sea, the East Indies, America, and the West Indies.\r\nFive years of such warfare proved exhausting, the ships on paying off\r\nin 1783 were in a terrible state of decay. Several foundered returning\r\nhome, owing to their ill-construction and rickety condition; their\r\niron bolts broke with the working, and the ships were mere bundles of\r\nboards. All this was owing to want of a better system of building, such\r\nas has since been brought to such perfection by Sir R. Seppings.”[27]\r\n\r\nAfter the peace the size of the French ships continued to increase, and\r\nevery effort was made to improve their design; but they were weak both\r\nin construction and material. Large three-deckers were once more built;\r\nthe _Commerce de Marseille_, 120, was of such extraordinary dimensions\r\nthat English critics thought that “size had now reached its ultimatum.”\r\nIn 1786 the French abolished the use of shingle as ballast; it created\r\na damp vapour between decks and gave a high centre of gravity. Iron\r\nballast had been tried in the frigate _Iphigène_ with great success.\r\n“She was very easy in a sea when under her courses; her extremities\r\nwere not overloaded with cannon; she mounted only 13 guns a side,\r\nwhereas she had room for 15. She was the best sea boat, and fastest\r\nsailing ship, perhaps, ever built. Her length was more than four times\r\nher breadth.”[28]\r\n\r\nIn England, as witnessed by the formation of the Society for the\r\nImprovement of Naval Architecture, feeling was widespread at this time\r\nthat something was lacking in our methods of ship construction. The\r\nnavy was in process of reorganization by a great administrator. In\r\n1784 Sir Charles Middleton created an establishment of naval stores.\r\nHe took under consideration shortly afterwards the growing scarcity of\r\ntimber and its more economical use. And in the course of his inquiry\r\nviews were expressed on naval shipbuilding which had an influence on\r\nsubsequent practice.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which ships were built for the East India Company\r\nwere far more scientific than those obtaining in the royal dockyards.\r\nThe timber was more carefully picked, and better seasoned. The hulls\r\nwere laid up under cover and well aired; they stood in frame for six\r\nmonths, and then, when the planks had been tacked on, they stood again,\r\nand no tree-nails were driven till all moisture had been dried out of\r\nthe timber. In design they were in many ways superior; in fact, they\r\nwere reputed the best and safest vessels in Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. Gabriel Snodgrass, the Company’s surveyor, under whose supervision,\r\nit was claimed, 989 ships had been built and repaired between the\r\nyears 1757 and 1794, only one of which had been lost at sea, gave\r\nilluminating evidence. “I am of opinion,” he said, “that all the ships\r\nof the navy are too short, from ten to thirty feet according to their\r\nrates, And if ships in future were to be built so much larger as to\r\nadmit of an additional timber between every port, and also if the\r\nforemost and aftermost gun-ports were placed a greater distance from\r\nthe extremities, they would be stronger and safer, have more room for\r\nfighting their guns, and, I am persuaded, would be found to answer\r\nevery other purpose much better than the present ships. The foremasts\r\nof all ships are placed too far forward; the ships are too lofty abaft,\r\nand too low in midships; they would be much better and safer, if their\r\nforecastles and quarter-decks were joined together; for if they carry\r\ntwo, three, or four tiers of guns, forward and abaft, they certainly\r\nought to carry the same in midships, as it is an absurdity to load the\r\nextremities with more weight of metal than the midships. No ships,\r\nhowever small, that have forecastles and quarter-decks, should go to\r\nsea with deep waists: they certainly ought to have flush upper decks.”\r\n\r\nShips of the navy, he considered, were too weak; they had plenty of\r\ntimber, but were deficient in iron fastenings, brackets, and standards.\r\nKnees should be of iron, which was lighter, cheaper, and stronger\r\nthan wood. The bottoms of all navy ships were too thin; the wales and\r\ninside stuff too thick. He particularly recommended diagonal braces\r\nfrom keelson to gun-deck clamps: six or eight pairs of these, secured\r\nwith iron knees or straps, should prevent ships from straining as\r\nthey did. He would reduce the tumble-home given to the topsides, and\r\nthus add to the strength both of hulls and masts; he would abolish\r\nquarter-galleries and give less rake to the sterns. Finally, he would\r\ndesign ships so as to require a minimum of compass timber; make no\r\nuse of oak where he could substitute fir or elm with propriety; and\r\nhave all timbers cut as nearly to the square as possible, to conserve\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nHis evidence, ending in a recommendation to the government to improve\r\nthe status of the naval shipwrights, has been handed down as a\r\nremarkable exposition of sound knowledge and good sense. The proposals\r\nwere beneficial, so far as they went, but they did not go far enough:\r\nthe whole system on which the hull timbers were disposed was wrong. The\r\ncontinuous increase in the size of ships was gradually exposing their\r\nweakness. And though in the next century a more scientific disposition\r\nwas to be adopted, for some years yet construction continued on the\r\nancient lines.[29]\r\n\r\nThe great wars with France, which broke out in the year 1792, found\r\nus adding both to the length and to the scantlings of our new ships.\r\nThree years before, the Admiralty had ordered two 110-gun ships to\r\nbe built, of 2332 tons burthen. One of them, the _Hibernia_, not\r\nfinished till the year 1805, was made more than eleven feet longer\r\nthan originally intended. Both of these ships were established with\r\n32-pounder guns for their main deck.[30] The unwieldy 42-pounder, used\r\non the lower decks of first and second-rate ships, was now displaced,\r\nin most ships, by the more rapidly worked 32-pounder. Lord Keppel\r\nhad tried, also, to substitute 32-pounders for 24-pounders on the\r\nmain deck of the _Victory_ and other ships in commission, so as to\r\nestablish them generally; but they were found too heavy on trial. He\r\nreplaced 6-pounders by 12-pounders, however, on the quarter-decks and\r\nforecastles. Carronades were now making their appearance. In excellence\r\nof material and honesty of workmanship our fleets were pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nThe value of large dimensions was by this time discerned; where\r\npossible extra length was given to ships building and those under\r\nrepair. Size still increased. The great _Commerce de Marseille_,\r\nbrought home a prize by Lord Hood in ’94, was forthwith matched by the\r\n_Caledonia_, which, ordered in this year but not completed until 1810,\r\nwas the greatest ship which had ever been built in this country. Still,\r\nside by side with news of world-shaking victories, came evidence of\r\nour ships’ inferiority in design. Not only the French, but the Spanish\r\ndockyards, produced vessels which could often outsail ours. Four large\r\nprizes taken at the battle off Cape St. Vincent surprised their new\r\nowners: “under their jury-masts, and poorly manned as they necessarily\r\nwere, they beat all the English ships working into the Tagus.”[31]\r\n\r\nAs the great wars went on, Britain deployed a constantly increasing\r\nnaval force. Prizes went to swell the number of ships put in\r\ncommission. “Mr. Pitt was foremost in getting every possible ship\r\nto sea; and under this pressure rotten old ships were doubled and\r\ncross-braced and otherwise strengthened and rendered fully adequate to\r\ntemporary service. Trafalgar followed, and the efforts of the civil\r\ndepartments were rewarded.”[32]\r\n\r\nWe have made little mention, in the foregoing pages, of the actual\r\ntonnage or dimensions of ships, for the reason that the figures\r\nwould be for the most part unreliable or misleading in import.\r\nThe basis on which tonnage was measured was constantly changing.\r\nIt was difficult to obtain accurate measurements of the principal\r\ndimensions; length, especially, was an indeterminate dimension, and,\r\nin the days when a large fore and aft rake was given, the length\r\nof keel gave no indication of the over-all length. Even if the\r\nover-all dimensions could be accurately measured, they gave small\r\ninformation as to the form of the hull: the fullness or fineness of\r\nthe lines, the form of the bow-curves and tuck, the position of the\r\nsection of maximum breadth, both longitudinally and relatively to\r\nthe water-line--proportions on which the sailing qualities of a ship\r\nlargely depended. In the seventeenth century the tonnage figures\r\nwere generally untrustworthy; the _Sovereign_ was quoted by three\r\ndifferent authorities as being of 1141, 1637, and 1556 tons burthen.\r\nIn the eighteenth century tonnage and dimensions possessed greater\r\ncomparative value. We confine ourselves to quoting the following\r\ntable of typical dimensions, taken from Charnock, showing the gradual\r\nexpansion which took place in the hundred years which have just been\r\nreviewed.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+----------+-------+-------+------+-------\r\n      Establishment    |  Length  |  Keel |Breadth| Depth|Tonnage\r\n                       |(gun-deck)|       |       |      |\r\n  ---------------------+----------+-------+-------+------+-------\r\n  1706 }               |  171′ 9″ |139′ 7″| 49′ 3″|19′ 6″| 1809\r\n  1719 } 100-gun ships |  175′ 0″ |140′ 7″| 50′ 3″|20′ 1″| 1883\r\n  1745 }               |  178′ 0″ |145′ 2″| 52′ 0″|21′ 6″| 2091\r\n  _Commerce de         |          |       |       |      |\r\n    Marseille_ (120)   |  208′ 4″ |172′ 0″| 54′ 9″|25′ ½″| 2747\r\n  _Caledonia_ (120)    |  205′ 0″ |170′ 9″| 53′ 8″|23′ 2″| 2616\r\n  ---------------------+----------+-------+-------+------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe slow progress of naval architecture up to the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, an advance the rate of which may be gauged from the fact that,\r\nexcept for sheathing and pumps, no important improvement was patented\r\nbetween the years 1618 and 1800, has been characterized as consisting\r\nmainly of approximations to the successive forms and arrangements\r\nof Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French ships, all of which had\r\nbeen in their turn superior to ours. Until the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the “bigotry of old practice” had effectually opposed any\r\nradical improvement, even though such improvement had been operating\r\nfor years in foreign navies and were brought continually before the\r\neyes of our professionals, embodied in captured prizes. In his _Naval\r\nDevelopment of the Century_ Sir Nathaniel Barnaby has drawn attention\r\nto the remarkable similarity which existed between the _Caledonia_\r\nof the early nineteenth, and the old _Sovereign_ of the seventeenth\r\ncentury: “Almost the only things of note were the reduction in height\r\nabove water, forward and aft, and a slight increase in dimensions. The\r\nproportion between length and breadth had undergone but little change.\r\nThere was almost the same arrangement of decks and ports; the same\r\nthin boarding in front of the forecastle; the same mode of framing\r\nthe stern, the same disposition of the outside planking in lines\r\ncrossing the sheer of the ports; nearly the same rig; the same external\r\nrudder-head, with a hole in the stern to admit the tiller; and probably\r\nthe same mode of framing the hull. For the ships of 1810 had no\r\ndiagonal framing of wood or iron, but the old massive vertical riders;\r\nno shelf or waterway to connect the beams with the sides; no fillings\r\nabove the floor-head; and no dowels in the frames. Ships were still\r\nmoored by hempen cables, and still carried immense stores of water in\r\nwooden casks.”\r\n\r\nTo Sir Robert Seppings was due the series of innovations in\r\nconstructional method which placed shipbuilding on a relatively\r\nscientific basis and thereby rendered it capable of meeting the\r\nincreasing demands involved in the growing size and force of warships.\r\nHis scheme, some elements of which had already been tested in H.M.\r\nships, was described in a paper read before the Royal Society in 1814.\r\nIn the briefest language we will attempt to explain it.\r\n\r\nIn the theory of structures, a jointed figure formed of four straight\r\nsides is known as a _deficient_ frame, since it has not a sufficient\r\nnumber of members to keep it in stable equilibrium under any system of\r\nloading. A triangle, on the other hand, is a _perfect_ frame, since it\r\nhas enough, and not more than enough, members to keep it in equilibrium\r\nhowever it may be loaded.\r\n\r\nThe hull of a timber-built ship consisted of a number of rigidly\r\njointed frames or cells, some lying in horizontal, some in vertical,\r\nand some in intermediate planes: the unit cell being a quadrilateral,\r\nwhose sides were formed by the frames and vertical riders and by the\r\nplanks, wales, and horizontal riders. Practically all the materials\r\ncomposing the fabric of a ship were disposed either in planes parallel\r\nto the plane of the keel or in planes at right angles to it. And up\r\nto the end of the Napoleonic wars our ships, without appreciable\r\nexception, were built on this primitive quadrilateral system. The\r\nsystem was essentially weak. All warships showed a tendency to\r\narch or hog--to become convex upwards, in the direction of their\r\nlength--owing to the fact that the support which they derived from\r\nthe water was relatively greater amidships than in the neighbourhood\r\nof their extremities. In the old days when ships were short in length\r\nthis tendency was small, or, if appreciable, a remedy was found in\r\nworking into the structures additional longitudinal and transverse\r\nriders, until the holds were not infrequently clogged with timber.\r\nBut as ships increased in length, the forces tending to “break the\r\nsheer” of a ship and arch its keel increased in greater ratio than\r\nthe ship’s power of resistance to the distortion; and by the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century, in spite of the aid of iron knees, stronger\r\nfastenings, and improved material generally, the essential weakness\r\nof our mode of construction had been gradually exposed. The _Victory_\r\nherself suffered from arching. The extremities of a 74-gun ship dropped\r\nsix inches, sometimes, when she entered the water from the stocks. A\r\nsimilar tendency to hog took place also across the breadth of a ship,\r\noccasioned by the dead weight of her guns. When rolling in heavy\r\nweather the momentum of her top weights caused large racking stresses\r\nto be thrown on the joints between the frames and the deck-beams. The\r\nbiographer of Admiral Symonds quotes Captain Brenton as follows: “I\r\nremember very well, when I was a midshipman in a 64-gun ship coming\r\nhome from India, cracking nuts by the working of the ship. We put them\r\nin under the knees, as she rolled one way, and snatched them out as she\r\nrolled back again.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING DISTORTION OF FRAMES UNDER LOAD]\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks it will be clear that a new method of construction\r\nwhich, by substituting the triangle for the rectangle, prevented the\r\ndistortion of a ship’s hull under the stresses of hogging and sagging,\r\nwould constitute an important innovation: even more important if, in\r\naddition, the new method resulted in a large economy of material. Such\r\na system Sir Robert Seppings introduced. Treating the hull as a girder\r\nliable to bend, he disposed the timbers to the best advantage to resist\r\ndeformation. The rectangular system, wherein frames and riders formed\r\nrectangular cells with no other power of resisting distortion into\r\nrhomboids than that derived from the rigidity of the joints, had been\r\nproved inefficient; just as a common field gate would be inefficient,\r\nand would easily distort, if built up solely of vertical and horizontal\r\ntimbers without any diagonal brace to make it a rigid figure. He solved\r\nthe problem with the triangle. By bracing each quadrilateral cell with\r\na diagonal timber he thereby divided it into two rigid and immovable\r\ntriangles, and thus made the whole ship rigid. The quadrilateral, when\r\nbraced, was known as a _trussed frame_. All the chief frames in the\r\nships he trussed; and since all bending took place from the centre of\r\nthe ship downwards to its ends, he made the trussed frames symmetrical\r\nabout the centre: the diagonals sloped forward in the after body, and\r\naft in the fore body, so as to resist the arching by extension. The\r\ntruss frame was embodied, not only in the lower part of the vessel\r\n(where its effect in resisting longitudinal bending was comparatively\r\nsmall), but in the more nearly vertical planes, and even in the\r\ntopsides between the gun-ports (where it was most effective). Its use\r\nwas estimated to result in the saving of nearly two hundred oak trees\r\nin the building of a 74-gun ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM REPRESENTING A SHIP WITH TRUSSED FRAMES]\r\n\r\nThis was one element of Seppings’ system. The others were: the\r\nfilling in of the spaces between the ground frames of the ship, so\r\nas to oppose with a continuous mass of timber the tendency of the\r\nlower parts to compress longitudinally, and to form a thick and solid\r\nbottom; the omission of the interior planking below the orlop clamps;\r\nthe connection of the beams with the frames by means of shelf-pieces,\r\nwaterways, and side binding-strakes to the deck; and the laying of the\r\ndecks diagonally.\r\n\r\nIn two other important respects Seppings improved on previous\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nAt Trafalgar the _Victory_, during her end-on approach to the enemy\r\nline, was raked, and her old-fashioned forecastle, with its thin\r\nflat-fronted bulkhead rising above the low head, was riddled and\r\nsplintered. This and similar experiences led to the introduction by the\r\nSurveyor of an improved bow, formed by prolonging the topsides to meet\r\nin a high curved stem, which not only deflected raking shot, but also\r\nconsolidated the bow into a strong wedge-shaped structure supporting a\r\nlofty bowsprit, and capable of being armed to give ahead fire from a\r\nnumber of guns.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the weakness of ships’ sterns was remedied. The broad flat\r\noverhanging stern which had been given to our ships throughout the\r\neighteenth century was not only structurally, but defensively weak.\r\nIn many actions, but notably in Admiral Cornwallis’ fighting retreat\r\nfrom the French in 1795, the weakness of our stern fire had been\r\nseverely felt; and, especially in view of the possible adaptation of\r\nsteam to ship propulsion, at this time foreshadowed, the desirability\r\nof an improvement was evident. Seppings abolished the flat stern in\r\nall new two- and three-deckers, substituting sterns circular (as seen\r\nfrom above), more compactly embodied, and having ports and embrasures\r\nin them for guns capable of fire along divergent radii. The circular\r\nstern gave place, after a few years, to an elliptical stern, which\r\npresented a more graceful appearance and afforded increased protection\r\nto the rudder-head. “The principal curves visible in it,” it was said,\r\n“harmonize so well with the sheer lines of the ship, that she appears\r\nto float lightly and easily upon the water.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the opening years of the new century important advances were made,\r\ntoo, in the organization of the royal dockyards. The interests of naval\r\narchitecture were served notably by Sir Samuel Bentham, brother of the\r\nfamous jurist and an ex-shipwright, who acquired honours in Russia and\r\nreturned to England to be Civil Architect and Engineer to the navy.\r\nBentham became a courageous Commissioner, and did much to stamp out\r\nabuses and to encourage efficiency; he was instrumental in checking\r\nthe sale of stores, in abolishing “chips,” in introducing steam pumps,\r\nblock machinery, and dry dock caissons, in improving the methods of\r\nbuilding ships and of mounting carronades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut still naval architecture, considered either as an art or as a\r\nscience, was stagnant. As a class the Surveyors were men of very\r\nrestricted education--“there is scarcely a name on the list of any\r\neminence as a designer or a writer.” Those who ordered ships at\r\nthe Board were “busy politicians, or amateurs without a knowledge\r\nof science, or sailors too impatient of innovation to regard\r\nimprovements.” In no other profession, perhaps, were theory and\r\npractice so out of sympathy with each other. The native art of the\r\nbuilder was numbed and shackled, by the restrictions imposed upon him\r\nas to tonnage and dimensions; the study of ship form, with a view to\r\nanalysing the forces under which sailing ships moved by wind through\r\nwater and to discovering the laws which those forces obeyed, was\r\nstill mainly an academic pastime of the Society for Improving Naval\r\nArchitecture, and outside the province of the naval authorities. Our\r\nships were still formed on no rational principle. Captured French ships\r\nserved as models to be copied. Often our builders would make fanciful\r\nvariations from the originals--a little more sheer, a little more\r\nbeam, etc. etc.--and as often they spoiled their copies. Whenever they\r\nfollowed closely the forms and features of the originals they succeeded\r\nin producing vessels which were pronounced to be among the best ships\r\nin the navy.\r\n\r\nWith this state of affairs, it is no matter for surprise that much of\r\nthe new construction of the period was of small value. “Sir Joseph\r\nYorke produced a set of corvettes, longer and narrower than brigs, none\r\nof which answered; and they were sold out of the service. Then came the\r\n‘Forty Thieves,’ a small class of 74’s; but in justice to the designer,\r\nSir H. Peake (who copied them from a French ship), it must be added\r\nthat his lines were altered by the Navy Board, and the vessels were\r\ncontract-built. Lord Melville built half a dozen ‘fir frigates,’ which\r\nneither sailed nor stood under canvas. The 22-gun and 28-gun donkey\r\nfrigates ‘could neither fight nor run away’; it was dangerous to be on\r\nboard them; and the bad sailing of such vessels was the chief cause of\r\nour ill success in the American War. The old 10-gun brigs, or ‘floating\r\ncoffins,’ as they were significantly styled, were equally dangerous and\r\nunsightly. They had no room to fight their guns; no air between decks,\r\nwhich were only five feet high; extra provisions and stores were piled\r\nabove hatches; and the fastest of them sailed no more than eight or\r\nnine knots.”[33]\r\n\r\nThe merchant service was in even worse plight. The tonnage rules had\r\nhad a deplorable effect upon merchant shipping. The ancient method\r\nof assessing a ship’s burthen was by measuring the product of its\r\nlength and breadth and depth, and dividing this by a constant number,\r\nwhich varied, at different periods, from 100 to 94. Early in the\r\neighteenth century, however, a simplification was innocently made:\r\nthe depth of the average ship being half the beam, a new formula was\r\napproved--length multiplied by half the square of the beam, divided by\r\n94.[34] The result might have been anticipated. Dues being paid only on\r\nthe length and breadth, vessels were given great depth of hold, full\r\nlines, and narrow beam. Absolved by the convoy system from trusting to\r\ntheir own speed for self-protection, English merchantmen became slugs:\r\nflat-bottomed, wall-sided boxes, monstrosities of marine architecture\r\nof which it was said that they were ‘built by the mile and served out\r\nby the yard.’\r\n\r\nTo raise the skill and status of our builders, the Committee of Naval\r\nRevision of 1806 presided over by Lord Barham advised the establishment\r\nof an official school, in which the more highly gifted apprentices\r\nmight study the science involved in naval architecture. In 1811 the\r\nschool was opened at Portsmouth, with Dr. Inman, a senior wrangler, as\r\npresident. Ships were designed by Dr. Inman and his pupils excellent in\r\nmany respects, and generally on an equality with those of the Surveyor\r\nand the master shipwrights. Yet still they were very imperfect. The\r\nofficial designs were hampered, not only by the hereditary prejudices\r\nand dogmas and by the cautious timidity of the builders themselves, but\r\nby the restrictions still imposed by the Navy Board, who insisted on\r\na certain specified armament in combination with a totally inadequate\r\nspecified tonnage: who laid down incompatible conditions, in short,\r\nunder which genius itself must fail of producing a satisfactory result.\r\n\r\nThe chains were broken in 1832.\r\n\r\nIn that year, when the whole administration of the navy was in process\r\nof reorganization, the office of Surveyor was offered to and accepted\r\nby a naval officer, Captain W. Symonds, R.N.: accepted by him on the\r\ncondition that he should be given a free hand in design and allowed to\r\ndecide himself of what tonnage and dimensions every ship should be. Sir\r\nRobert Seppings was superannuated. The school of naval architecture\r\nwas abolished. The sensation produced was powerful. “Except on matters\r\nof religion,” said Sir James Graham, when the appointment was being\r\ndebated in the House of Commons some years afterwards, “I do not\r\nknow any difference of opinion which has been attended with so much\r\nbitterness--so much anger--so much resentment, as the merits of Sir W.\r\nSymonds and the virtues of his ships.”\r\n\r\nThese violent differences and resentments have long since been\r\ncomposed, and Sir William Symonds has been accorded the position due\r\nto him in the history of naval architecture. His opponents, those who\r\nhad resented his appointment as against the best interests of the\r\nservice, rejoiced that he had freed ship design from the traditional\r\nrestrictions under which it had stagnated; his chief admirers were\r\nled in the course of time to agree in the desirability of having\r\nas Surveyor a man thoroughly grounded in the scientific principles\r\nunderlying the motion of bodies through water, their stability in\r\nwater, and all the forces acting on a ship at sea.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1821 Lieutenant Symonds, while holding an appointment at\r\nMalta, had designed and built for himself a yacht which he called\r\n_Nancy Dawson_. Yachting had at this date become a national sport, and\r\nthe interest of influential patrons in sailing matches was already\r\nacting as a stimulus to the study of ship form. The chief cause of\r\nthe beneficial reaction from the indifference of former generations,\r\nsays his biographer, was the establishment of the Yacht Club, after\r\nthe peace of 1815, and the interest which men of rank and fortune\r\nhenceforth took in shipbuilding, and in procuring the best native\r\nmodels.[35] So great was the success of the _Nancy Dawson_, that (in\r\nhis own words) he was led to believe that he had hit upon a secret in\r\nnaval architecture; while experiments on other sailing boats seemed to\r\nconfirm him in his principles. Great breadth of beam and extraordinary\r\nsharpness--in fact, what was described as “a peg-top section”--were\r\nthe characteristic features of his system, with a careful attention to\r\nstowage, the stand of the masts, and the cut and setting of the sails.\r\n\r\n“Upon this most slender basis was the whole fabric of Sir William’s\r\nsubsequent career built. The yacht gained him the notice of noblemen\r\nand others, then followed a pamphlet on naval architecture (in which\r\nthe defects of existing ships were pointed out, and great breadth of\r\nbeam and rise of floor advocated); then came a promise from the First\r\nLord of the Admiralty, Lord Melville, that he should build a sloop of\r\nwar on his plans, which he did, the vessel being called the _Columbine_\r\n(promotion intervening); then further patronage from the Duke of\r\nPortland and the Duke of Clarence, the latter of whom, when he became\r\nLord High Admiral, ordered him to lay down a 40-gun frigate (promotion\r\nagain intervening); then the building of the _Pantaloon_, 10-gun brig,\r\nfor the Duke of Portland, from whom the Admiralty purchased her; then\r\nthe patronage of that most mischievous civilian First Lord, Sir J.\r\nGraham; then the order for the _Vernon_, 50-gun frigate; and then, in\r\n’32, the Surveyorship of the Navy.”[36]\r\n\r\nTo Sir Edward Reed and other shipbuilding officers the appointment of\r\nthis brilliant amateur to the supreme control of the department seemed\r\nan act of war, not only on professional architects, but upon naval\r\narchitecture itself. They admitted the success of the Symondite ships\r\nin speed and certain sailing qualities, but denied the correctness\r\nof his principles and strenuously resisted his innovations. A great\r\nbreadth of beam was particularly objectionable to the scientific\r\nbuilder; not only did it imply a large resistance to the passage of\r\nthe ship through water, but it contributed to an excess in metacentric\r\nheight, abnormal stiffness, and an uneasy motion. “For a time his\r\nopinions triumphed; but after a while the principles expounded by his\r\nsubordinates (Creuze, Chatfield, and Read) were accepted as correct,\r\nwhile not a single feature of Sir William’s system of construction\r\nis retained, except certain practical improvements which he\r\nintroduced.”[37]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ‘Victoria’\r\n  Breadth = 59′ 2″\r\n  Length = 204′\r\n\r\n  ‘Caledonia’\r\n  Breadth = 53′ 6″\r\n  Length = 205′\r\n\r\nFig: 1.\r\n\r\n  ‘Vernon’\r\n  Breadth = 52′\r\n  Length = 176′\r\n\r\n  ‘Barham’\r\n  Breadth = 47′ 10″\r\n  Length = 173′ 8″\r\n\r\nFig: 2.\r\n\r\nTYPICAL SECTIONS OF “SYMONDITE” AND CONTEMPORARY SHIPS]\r\n\r\nNevertheless his opponents, as before remarked, freely acknowledged\r\nthe value of his services to the country, especially in breaking down\r\nthe restrictions which had hitherto been imposed on constructors in\r\nrespect of dimensions. His biographer pays tribute to the intuitive\r\ngenius which enabled him to tell at a glance the trim required for\r\na sailing ship, and to sketch out, as a brilliant impromptu, the\r\nbest form of hull. But were these efforts entirely spontaneous? Were\r\nthey not the reward of hidden and persistent work, observation, and\r\ncalculation, carried out for years by the young officer who never\r\nlet a sailing ship come near him without contriving to board her and\r\nascertain her principal properties and dimensions? Here, surely, is\r\nthe undramatic but praiseworthy method by which he attained success: a\r\nmethod, essentially scientific, which enabled its user, even without\r\nknowledge of other important principles governing ship design, to\r\nperform a national service in revolutionizing our methods of naval\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nUnder the control of Sir William Symonds the improvement in the form\r\nand qualities of our ships, begun under the surveyorship of Sir\r\nRobert Seppings, continued to progress. Ship dimensions increased,\r\nand now bore a more correct relation to the dead-weight of armament,\r\nstores, and crew, which they had to carry. All classes from cutters\r\nto first-rates carried a more generous beam, and gained by the\r\nnovel feature. Sounder rules were devised, partly as the result of\r\na succession of sailing trials, for the pitching of masts and the\r\nmethods of stowing. In short, naval architecture entered upon a new and\r\npromising era. Foreign observers recorded the progress made. Instead of\r\nbeing servile imitations of the products of French and Spanish models\r\nthe vessels which flew the English flag became objects of admiration to\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TUDOR SHIP OF PERIOD 1540-50\r\n\r\nFrom a Cottonian MS. in the British Museum]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SMOOTH-BORE GUN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the question of the date at which the discovery of gunpowder took\r\nplace writers have held the most divergent views. The opinion of the\r\nmajority has been that its properties were known in the remote ages\r\nof antiquity, and this opinion has been formed and confirmed by the\r\naccounts given of its origin by most of the medieval writers. The\r\nChinese claim to have known it long before the Christian era. And from\r\nhints in classical literature, and on the broad ground of probability,\r\nit has been inferred by some authorities that the explosive properties\r\nof gunpowder were known to the ancients. The wonderful property of\r\nsaltpetre, they argue, must certainly have been known to the wise\r\nmen of old: its extraordinary combustive power when mixed with other\r\nsubstances. Melted alone over a hot fire saltpetre does not burn; but\r\nif a pinch of some other substance is added, a violent flame results.\r\nIn many fortuitous circumstances, they say, saltpetre must have been\r\nfound in contact with that other essential ingredient of gunpowder,\r\ncharcoal. And such a circumstance has been pictured by one writer as\r\noccurring when camp fires, lit upon soil impregnated with nitre (like\r\nthat in parts of India), were rekindled; the charred wood converted\r\ninto charcoal forming with the nitre a slightly explosive mixture.\r\n\r\nOther investigators maintain that gunpowder, which claims a spurious\r\nantiquity, is really an invention of the Middle Ages. Incendiary\r\ncompositions--Greek fire, and other substances based on the properties\r\nof quicklime, naphtha, phosphorus, etc.--were undoubtedly known to\r\nthe ancient world. But explosive compositions, based on saltpetre\r\nas the principal ingredient, were certainly not known in all their\r\nfearful power. The silence of history on the subject of the projection\r\nof missiles by explosive material, says a recent authority,[38] is\r\neloquent; the absence of its terminology from such languages as Chinese\r\nand Arabic, conclusive.\r\n\r\nWhichever of the two views may be correct it is certain that a\r\nknowledge of gunpowder was possessed by the great alchemist, Roger\r\nBacon, who in A.D. 1249 committed to paper an account of its\r\nproperties.[39] To Berthold the Black Friar is given the credit for\r\nits application to military ends; whom legend, in an impish mood, has\r\nhoisted with his own discovery.\r\n\r\nIn a learned work on the early days of artillery an English writer has\r\ndescribed the difficulties encountered in tracing the first stages\r\nof the evolution of guns and gunpowder. Confusion was caused by the\r\nfact that, after gunpowder had been introduced, military engines were\r\nstill known by the same generic names as those borne in pre-gunpowder\r\ndays. No contemporary pictures of guns could be discovered. The loose\r\nstatements of historians, the license of poets, and the anachronisms\r\nof the illuminators of the medieval MSS., all tended to lead the\r\ninvestigator astray and to make his task more difficult. The statements\r\nof the historians are indeed whole hemispheres and centuries apart;\r\nas for poets, our own Milton assigned the invention of artillery to\r\nthe devil himself; and “from the illuminators we should gain such\r\ninformation as, that Gideon used field pieces on wheeled carriages\r\nwith shafts, when he fought against the Midianites, as in a MS. in the\r\nBritish Museum.”[40]\r\n\r\nOf all the clues which throw light on the origin of artillery the most\r\nimportant yet discovered lies in some MSS. belonging to the city of\r\nGhent. After a list of municipal officers for the year 1313 occurs the\r\nentry: “Item, in this year the use of bussen was first discovered in\r\nGermany by a monk.” And there is evidence that in the following year\r\n“guns” were manufactured in Ghent and exported to England.[41] The same\r\ncentury was to witness a wonderful development of the new-found power.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that the first application of gunpowder to warlike\r\npurposes should have been, not only to strike terror by violent\r\nexplosion and thus obtain an important moral effect, but to project\r\nthe missiles already in military use: arrows and ponderous stones. Two\r\ndistinct types of artillery were thus foreshadowed. The first took the\r\nform of a dart-throwing pot or vase, a narrow-necked vessel from which,\r\nin imitation of the cross-bow, stout metal-winged arrows were fired;\r\nwhile, for projecting stones of great size and weight in imitation of\r\nthe ancient siege-machines, large clumsy pieces made of several strips\r\nof iron fitted together lengthways and then hooped with iron rings were\r\neventually developed.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the fourteenth century the guns manufactured were\r\nof the former type. In _The Origin of Artillery_ a reproduction is\r\ngiven of an illuminated MS. belonging to Christ Church, Oxford, dated\r\n1326, showing an arrow-throwing vase: the earliest picture of a gun\r\nwhich is known. And, from a French document quoted by Brackenbury, it\r\nappears that in 1338 there was in the marine arsenal at Rouen an iron\r\nfire-arm--_pot de fer_--which was provided with bolts (“carreaux,” or\r\nquarrels) made of iron and feathered.\r\n\r\nBut the unsuitability of the arrow for use in conjunction with\r\ngunpowder as a propellant was, even at this date, realized. There was\r\nobvious difficulty in preventing the powder gases from escaping through\r\nthe windage space between the arrow-shafts and the neck of the vase,\r\neven with the aid of leather collars. So the arrow almost immediately\r\nevolved into a stone or metal sphere; the narrow neck of the vase\r\nincreased to the full diameter of the vessel. And as early as 1326,\r\nthe date of the picture of the arrow-throwing vase, cannon of brass,\r\nwith iron balls, were being made at Florence for the defence of the\r\ncommune. The use of the new weapons quickly spread. By 1344 the cannon\r\nis mentioned by Petrach as “an infernal instrument of wood, which\r\nsome think invented by Archimedes,” yet “only lately so rare as to be\r\nlooked on as a great miracle; now, ... it has become as common as any\r\nother kind of weapon.” By 1412, according to unquestionable testimony\r\nsupplied by public documents, cannon were employed in English ships:\r\nbreech-loading guns with removable chambers.[42]\r\n\r\nIn 1346 Edward III fought Cressy. Whether or no cannon were used in\r\nthis decisive battle has been a matter of considerable controversy.\r\nAccording to Villani, an old Florentine chronicler who gave an account\r\nof the campaign, they were; but no mention of them was made by\r\nFroissart, who wrote some years later. The silence of Froissart has\r\nbeen attributed, however, to a desire to avoid offending our court by\r\nimplying that the victory was due to other than the prowess of the\r\nPrince of Wales; or tainting our success with any mention of “devilish\r\nmachines which were universally regarded as destructive to valour\r\nand honour and the whole institution of chivalry.” Though English\r\nchronicles contain no mention of gunpowder till some years after\r\nCressy, yet evidence exists that artillery--“gunnis cum sagittis et\r\npellotis”--was extensively used in this campaign. “But the powder was\r\nof so feeble a nature and the cannon so small, that the effect of a few\r\nof them, fired only a few times, could not have been very noticeable\r\ncompared with the flights of arrows.”[43]\r\n\r\nCannon in the first half of the fourteenth century were indeed feeble\r\nweapons compared with the huge mechanical engines of the period;\r\nyet their moral effect was very great and their physical effect by\r\nno means negligible. They were destructive of chivalry, in a quite\r\nliteral sense. The value of cavalry as an arm was greatly reduced by\r\ntheir adoption in the field. They took from the horseman cased in\r\ncomplete armour all the advantage he possessed over other troops.\r\nInstead of forming the nucleus of the fighting strength of an army,\r\nthe armour-clad nobles and their mounted retinues became somewhat of\r\nan encumbrance, and a change in the composition and strength of armies\r\nfrom this time ensued. Tournaments went out of fashion, chivalry\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nAgainst material, cannon proved even more effective. As the\r\narrow-throwing gun gradually disappeared, giving place to small\r\ncylindrical cannon firing lead and iron balls, other ordnance, designed\r\nfor projecting large stones against the gates and walls of forts and\r\ncastles, grew rapidly to an enormous size. Made usually of forged\r\niron bars welded and strengthened circumferentially by coils of iron\r\nribbon or rope, and using a weak gunpowder, these giant “bombards”\r\nbegan to play an important part in land warfare, especially in those\r\ninternecine wars which were constantly being waged in Flanders and\r\nin Northern Italy. Two peoples were conspicuous at this period for\r\ntheir wealth, culture, and energy: the Lombards and the Flemings. The\r\nformer, by their contact with the East, had drawn into their hands\r\nmost of the commerce of Europe; the latter, welded together in the\r\nHanseatic League, were in the van of northern civilization. It was in\r\nItaly, probably, that cannon were first employed, and in Italy where\r\nthey developed most rapidly. Their use had an immediate effect on land\r\nwarfare; the defensive value of masonry was suddenly depreciated, and\r\ntown-gate, fort, and campanile, which had for centuries defied the old\r\nmechanical engines, could no longer be considered impregnable.[44]\r\n\r\nIn the following century the development of the bombard continued. The\r\nLombards cast them in bronze, adorned them with elaborate mouldings\r\nand furnished their ends with swellings like capstan-heads, of equal\r\ndiameter, to facilitate rolling and parbuckling. In the hands of the\r\nFlemish artisans this type reached a remarkable degree of perfection in\r\na famous bombard called “Dulle Griete,” which was made at Ghent about\r\nA.D. 1430. The bombard of Ghent consists of two parts, a larger part to\r\nform the barrel for the stone sphere of 25 inches diameter, a smaller\r\npart, of much thicker metal, to form the chamber in which the powder\r\ncharge is placed. These two parts are screwed together, screw threads\r\nbeing formed on a boss on the front end of the chamber and in a hole in\r\nthe rear end of the barrel. This is thought to be the piece described\r\nby Froissart as “une bombarde merveilleusement grande, laquelle avoit\r\ncinquante trois pouces de bec, et jetoit carreaux merveilleusement\r\ngrands et gros et pesants; et quand cette bombarde descliquoit, on\r\nl’ouoit par jour bien de cinq lieues loin, et par nuit de dix; et\r\nmenoit si grand’ noise au descliquer, que il sembloit que tous les\r\ndiables d’enfer fussent au chemin.”\r\n\r\nA fine example of the built-up bombard is “Mons Meg,” the piece which\r\nnow lies at Edinburgh Castle, and which was made at Mons about A.D.\r\n1460: formed of longitudinal wrought-iron bars welded and hooped\r\ncircumferentially, of 20 inches in the bore, and designed to fire a\r\nstone ball of over three hundred pounds’ weight.\r\n\r\nIt was in the hands of the Turks, then at the zenith of their power,\r\nthat medieval ordnance achieved its greatest development, and it is\r\nthought probable that Flemish pieces served as the model on which the\r\nOttoman artillery was based. The siege of Constantinople, in the year\r\n1453, was notable for “the reunion which it presented of ancient and\r\nmodern artillery--catapults, cannon, bullets, battering rams, gunpowder\r\nand Greek fire.” And it was especially notable from the power of the\r\nmodern artillery there assembled, an artillery which represented\r\na climax of size and military value. Gibbon has given us a vivid\r\ndescription of the Ottoman ordnance and its capabilities. “Mahomet\r\nstudied with peculiar care the recent and tremendous discovery of the\r\nLatins; and his artillery surpassed whatever had yet appeared in the\r\nworld. A founder of cannon, a Hungarian, a deserter from the Greek\r\nservice, was liberally entertained by the Sultan. On his assurance a\r\nfoundry was established at Adrianople; the metal was prepared; and at\r\nthe end of three months Urban produced a piece of brass ordnance of\r\nstupendous and almost incredible magnitude; a measure of twelve palms\r\nis assigned to the bore; and the stone bullet weighs above six hundred\r\npounds. A trial was held, a proclamation having warned the populace.\r\nThe explosion was enormous and was heard one hundred furlongs off, and\r\nthe ball, by the force of the gunpowder, was hurled above a mile.”\r\n\r\n“A stranger as I am to the art of destruction,” continues the\r\nhistorian--who, we may note in passing, had been through his courses\r\nat Hilsea and was a major in the Hants Militia--“I can discern that\r\nthe modern improvements of artillery prefer the number of pieces to\r\nthe weight of metal; the quickness of fire to the sound, or even\r\nthe consequence, of a single explosion. Yet I dare not reject the\r\npositive and unanimous evidence of contemporary writers; nor can it\r\nseem improbable that the first artists, in their rude and ambitious\r\nefforts, should have transgressed the standard of moderation.... The\r\ngreat cannon, flanked by two fellows of almost equal size, was set up.\r\nFourteen batteries thundered at once against the walls, one of which\r\ncontained 130 guns! Under a master who counted the minutes, firing\r\ncould take place seven times in a day.”\r\n\r\nInteresting corroboration of Gibbon’s account has since been\r\ndiscovered in a MS. by a contemporary Greek writer, found at\r\nConstantinople in the year 1870.[45] According to this chronicler the\r\ncannon are actually cast on the field of action. Mahomet summons the\r\ngunmakers and discourses with them on the kind of ordnance required\r\nto beat down the walls of the city. They reply that larger cannon are\r\nnecessary than any they possess; and they suggest melting down the\r\npieces available to form others of sufficient size and power. The\r\nSultan commands the thing to be done. Quantities of plastic clay are\r\nkneaded, linen and hemp and threads being mixed with it to stiffen it\r\nfor forming gigantic moulds. Furnaces are erected, and charged with\r\ncopper and tin. Bellows are worked for three days and three nights, and\r\nthen, the metal being ready, the molten mass is poured. Within sight\r\nof the beleaguered city huge cannon are cast which, placed on wooden\r\nsleepers on the ground with their butts supported to prevent recoil\r\ndischarge stones weighing nearly 700 pounds against the walls.\r\n\r\nBut there is no need of documentary evidence to attest the power of\r\nthe Ottoman artillery of this period; cannon built on the above model\r\nhave guarded the Dardanelles for centuries, and, what is more, have\r\nproved sufficiently effective in modern engagements. In 1807 Sir John\r\nDuckworth’s squadron was struck repeatedly by stones of enormous\r\nweight, discharged from these cannon in an attempt to prevent its\r\npassage. And it is known that some of them were made shortly after\r\nthe taking of Constantinople. These cannon, says General Lefroy, were\r\ncast on their faces, “the dead-head being left at the breech-end and\r\nhewn off with axes, probably while the metal was hot.” In one of them\r\nbrought home to England “the axe marks are plain; similar marks may be\r\nobserved on other early guns which have the breech cut off square.” The\r\nsimilarity of design between this Turkish gun and the Flemish bombards\r\nis too close to be accidental; their construction is of peculiar\r\ninterest and has the main features in common. “The external form of the\r\ngun is a cylinder, the muzzle being as large as the breech; but either\r\nhalf is relieved by a boldly projecting moulding at each end, which\r\nis divided transversely by sixteen cross-bars into as many recesses:\r\nthus serving to give a purchase to the levers used in screwing the two\r\nparts together.” How the screw threads were cut is not known, but “we\r\ncan suppose that moulding pieces were first cut in wood and nicely\r\nfitted and then applied to the clay moulds.” The charge of powder used\r\nwith this type of piece was as much as a hundredweight. In spite of the\r\nweakness of the squib-like powder its physical and moral effect was\r\nundoubtedly important. “Thus inconceivable and incredible,” writes the\r\nchronicler of 1467, “is the nature of this machine. The ancient princes\r\nand generals did not possess and had no knowledge of such a thing....\r\nIt is a new invention of the Germans or of the Kelts made about one\r\nhundred and fifty years ago, or a little more. It is an ingenious and\r\nhappy discovery, especially the powder, which is a composition made\r\nof saltpetre, of sulphur, of charcoals, and of herbs, from the which\r\ncomposition is generated a dry hot gas....”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TURKISH BRONZE CANNON\r\n\r\nFrom Lloyd and Hadcock’s _Artillery_]\r\n\r\nThe founding of these enormous cannon on the field of action is in\r\nitself a tribute to the energy and resourcefulness of the nation who\r\nhave been described as being, at that time, the finest engineers in the\r\nworld. Of the effectiveness of the Ottoman artillery there is evidence\r\nin the results achieved. Constantinople fell to the giant bombards. And\r\nin the early part of the following century Rhodes, the last outpost\r\nof the Knights, fell to the same great power. The invention of the\r\nChristians[46] was, in fact, the weapon which gave supremacy to the\r\nInfidel in the eastern part of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the evolution of artillery was taking a new direction.\r\nThe large and relatively feeble ordnance of the Turks was, in the\r\ncircumstances, not entirely unsuitable for the purpose for which it\r\nwas intended: the smashing of masonry and the breaching of gates and\r\nwalls. The maximum of effect was obtained from a missile of enormous\r\nmass projected with a low velocity. Nevertheless its disadvantages were\r\nobvious. Large cannon cast in bronze were necessarily of great expense\r\nand weight, their discharges were few and far between, they wore\r\nrapidly and were thus short-lived, and they possessed the dangerous\r\nproperty of becoming brittle when heated. An increase in power and a\r\nreduction in weight were required for the achievement of a portable\r\nartillery, and the progress of mechanical science pointed to wrought\r\niron as the material of which such an artillery might be made.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of iron in small quantities from ferruginous ore was\r\na comparatively simple operation, even in primitive times. With the\r\naid of bellows and a plentiful supply of wood charcoal the smith was\r\nable to make his furnace yield small masses of metallic iron of the\r\npurest quality. This iron, wrought on an anvil, could be drawn out\r\ninto plate or bar as desired, the resulting metal being, by reason of\r\nthe purity of the charcoal used in its extraction, of great toughness,\r\nhomogeneity, and strength. In Spain and Italy were mines which had\r\nlong been famed for their iron. In England the Roman had made good use\r\nof the metal found in the Sussex mines, and all through the middle\r\nages the wealds of Kent and Sussex were the centres of the English\r\niron trade. In the fourteenth century improved methods came into use;\r\nthe adoption of water-power for driving the bellows, for crushing the\r\ncharcoal, and for operating the tilt-hammers, had its effect on the\r\ndevelopment of the iron-smelting industry; higher temperatures obtained\r\nand larger masses of ore could now be treated; the iron, produced in\r\nlarger quantities by improved methods, was perhaps purer and stronger\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nIn wrought iron, then, a material was available which almost alone\r\nwas suitable for the manufacture of the more portable sorts of gun.\r\nBy its use guns could be made strong enough, without being of an\r\nexcessive weight, to withstand the increasing stresses thrown on them,\r\nfirst, by the use of iron bullets instead of stone, and secondly, by\r\nthe discovery of an improved gunpowder. Artillery underwent a dual\r\ndevelopment. On the one hand, for use with the weak cannon powder,\r\nwas the large stone-throwing ordnance, made of cast bronze or of\r\nhooped bars of iron; on the other, for use with iron shot and a\r\nstronger propellant, were various denominations of small portable and\r\nsemi-portable wrought-iron guns. These two distinct types developed\r\nside by side until the middle of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe use of iron and lead balls, the superiority of which over balls of\r\nstone had doubtless been manifested in former centuries in connection\r\nwith the projection of Greek fire, was practised by the Florentines\r\nsoon after the invention of guns themselves. The discovery of “corned”\r\ngunpowder took place a century later.\r\n\r\nIn its original form gunpowder possessed many disadvantages as a\r\npropellant. Ground into a fine powder, and composed in the first\r\ninstance of almost equal proportions of saltpetre, sulphur, and\r\ncharcoal, it was peculiarly liable to accidental explosion, so that\r\nfrequently the charcoal was kept separate from the other ingredients\r\nand mixed just prior to use. If kept mixed it easily disintegrated,\r\nin the shaking of transport, into three strata, the charcoal coming\r\nto the top and the sulphur sinking to the bottom. It was intensely\r\nhygroscopic, and quickly fouled the barrels of the pieces in which it\r\nwas used. But, most important of all, the efficiency of its combustion\r\ndepended to an inconvenient degree upon the density with which, after\r\nbeing ladled into the gun, it was rammed home. The greatest care had\r\nto be exercised in ramming. If pressed into too dense a mass the\r\npowder largely lost its explosive character; the flame which ignited\r\nthe portion nearest the vent could not spread through the mass with\r\nsufficient speed; it quietly petered out. If rammed too loosely, on the\r\nother hand, the explosive effect was also lost. A great gain ensued\r\ntherefore when, in place of the fine or “serpentine” powder, corned\r\npowder came to be used, about the middle of the fifteenth century. In\r\nthis form the powder was damped and worked into grains, crushed to the\r\nrequisite size and sieved for uniformity. These grains were finally\r\nglazed to prevent deterioration from the effects of damp; and the\r\nresulting powder proved stronger and more efficient in every way than\r\nthe same mixture in its more primitive form.\r\n\r\nSome time was to elapse before guns could be cast of sufficient\r\nstrength to withstand the force of corned powder. “Chemistry had outrun\r\nmetallurgy.” The larger species of ordnance were restricted to the\r\nuse of serpentine powder until the middle of the sixteenth century.\r\nNevertheless, cast ordnance as well as the lighter forged iron guns\r\nwere developed continuously for service in the field. Named after\r\nbirds and reptiles and clumsily cast of such shapes and weights as\r\npleased the founders’ fancy, they were of use chiefly in demolishing\r\nby attrition the gates and walls of forts and cities. From the battle\r\nof Cressy onward, first in huge carts and then on their own wheeled\r\ncarriages, they rumble across the pages of European history.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nAt sea the evolution of ordnance had to conform, of course, to the\r\nprogress of naval architecture and the changing nature of the warfare.\r\nIn the Mediterranean, where the oar-propelled galley remained for\r\ncenturies the typical fighting ship, the bombard was planted in the\r\nbows, shackled to a deck-carriage upon the centre line, to give ahead\r\nfire and to supplement the effects of a powerful ram. As the galley\r\ndeveloped, the main central gun became flanked by other bow-chasers;\r\nwhile on the beams and poop light wrought-iron breech-loading swivel\r\nguns formed a secondary armament whose double function was to repel\r\nboarders and to overawe its own slave-crew. In the Atlantic, where\r\nthe typical fighting vessel was the lofty sailing ship, the same\r\ntwo different types of armament had vogue. But in this case their\r\ndistribution was different; the sailing ship, with no recourse to oars\r\nfor manœuvring, could not always ensure an end-on attack or defence,\r\nand had to arm herself against an enemy from any quarter. Her freedom\r\nfrom oars, her height, and the invention of the porthole, enabled\r\nthe early “great ship” to mount a sufficiently distributed all-round\r\narmament. While her sides were pierced for ponderous bombards, her\r\npoop and forecastle bristled with the same light secondary armament\r\nas figured in the Mediterranean galley. This artillery was almost\r\nentirely for defence. Before Elizabethan days (as we have already\r\nnoted) sea battles were nothing more than hand-to-hand fights; the\r\nattacking vessel was laid alongside its enemy, sails were furled, and\r\nboarding took place. If, after being swept by spherical shot from\r\nthe bombards and showers of stones and dice from the mortars and\r\nperiers, the boarders could carry the waist of the defending ship,\r\nthey still had to capture the barricaded forecastle and poop, from\r\nwhose rails a multitude of the smaller ordnance--port-pieces, fowlers,\r\nserpentines--were trained upon them and behind whose bulkheads crossbow\r\nand harquebuss were plied against them in concealment.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century witnessed the greatest strides in the evolution\r\nof sea ordnance. In the Mediterranean the decisive effect of gunfire,\r\nproved in the sea fight off Prevesa in the year 1538, was confirmed\r\nby the victory of the Christians over the Turks at Lepanto in 1571.\r\nIn the Atlantic England began her long preparation for securing a sea\r\nsupremacy and, under the masterful eye of King Henry VIII, adapted\r\nmore and more powerful guns for service in the royal ships. Of the\r\nprofessional interest which the King took in the development of\r\nordnance there is ample evidence. At the royal word French and Flemish\r\ngunfounders were induced to come to England to teach the technique of\r\ntheir craft, and to this puissant prince the Italian savant, Tartaglia,\r\ndedicated his classic treatise on the Art of Shooting. England now\r\nlearnt to found, not only bronze, but _cast-iron_ cannon. “Although,”\r\nsays Grose, “artillery was used from the time of King Edward III and\r\npurchased from abroad by all our successive Kings, it seems extremely\r\nstrange, that none of our workmen attempted to cast them, till the\r\nreign of King Henry VIII, when in 1521, according to Stowe, or 1535\r\n(Camden says), great brass ordnance, as canons and culverins, were\r\nfirst cast in England by one John Owen, they formerly having been\r\nmade in other countries.” And from Stowe’s Chronicle he quotes the\r\nfollowing: “The King minding wars with France, made great preparations\r\nand provision, as well of munitions and artillery as also of brass\r\nordnance; amongst which at that time one Peter Bawd, a Frenchman born,\r\na gun-founder or maker of great ordnance, and one other alien, called\r\nPeter Van Collen, a gunsmith, both the King’s feedmen, conferred\r\ntogether, devised and caused to be made, certain mortar pieces, being\r\nat the mouth from 11 inches, unto 19 inches wide; for the use whereof,\r\nthe said Peter and Peter caused to be made certain hollow shot of\r\ncast yron, stuffed with fire-works, or wild-fire; whereof the bigger\r\nsort for the same had screws of yron to receive a match to carry fire\r\nkindled, that the fire-work might be set on fire to break in small\r\npieces the same hollow shot, whereof the smallest piece hitting any\r\nman, would kill or spoil him. And after the King’s return from Bullen,\r\nthe said Peter Bawd by himself in the first year of Edward VI did also\r\nmake certain ordnance of cast yron of diverse sorts and forms, as\r\nfawconets, falcons, minions, sakers and other pieces.”[47] The casting\r\nof iron guns in Germany has been traced back as far as the fourteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAccording to another account the first English cast-iron guns were\r\nmade at Buxted, in Sussex, by one Ralph Hogge in 1543. Peter Bawd,\r\nthe French founder, was an assistant who had come to this country to\r\nteach him the method. But it seems that his connection with Hogge was\r\nnot of long duration; for, “John Johnson, covenant servant to the said\r\nP. Bawd, succeeded and exceeded his master in this his art of casting\r\nordnance, making them cleaner and to better proportion. And his son,\r\nThomas Johnson, a special workman, in and before the year 1595 made\r\n42 cast pieces of great ordnance of iron, for the Earl of Cumberland,\r\nweighing 6000 pounds, or three tons a-piece.”[48]\r\n\r\nThe advance made in the power of King Henry’s sea ordnance is\r\nunmistakably shown from trustworthy documents. There is a continuous\r\nprogress during the reign, and ships which were rebuilt subsequently\r\ncarried an armament entirely different from that which they\r\noriginally had. The _Sovereign_, for instance, built about the\r\nyear 1488, originally carried one hundred and eighty guns, mostly\r\nsmall serpentines. As rebuilt in A.D. 1509 she carried an armament\r\nwhich included four curtalls, three demi-curtalls, three culverins,\r\ntwo falcons, and eleven heavy iron guns. From an inventory of the\r\narmament of the _Henry Grace à Dieu_, of 1514, it appears[49] that\r\nthat historic ship was then armed with a miscellaneous collection of\r\npieces, comprising 122 iron serpentines, 12 “grete yron gonnes of oone\r\nmakyng and bygnes,” 12 ditto “that come owt of fflaunders,” all with\r\nseparate chambers; 2 “grete Spanish peces of yron of oone sorte,”\r\nwith chambers; 18 “stone gonnes apon Trotill wheles,” with chambers;\r\n“ffawcons of Brasse apon Trotill wheles”; one “grete bumberde of Brasse\r\napon iiij trotill wheles”; two “grete culverynes of Brasse apon unshodd\r\nwheles”; as well as a “grete curtalle of Brasse upon iiij wheles,” a\r\nsling, vice pieces, and serpentines of brass on wheels shod with iron.\r\nRebuilt at a later date the _Henry_ carried a different armament,\r\nwhich included brass cannons, demi-cannons, culverins, demi-culverins,\r\nsakers, and cannon-periers.\r\n\r\nThe transition of armament is plainly marked for us in the case of\r\nthe _Mary Rose_, rebuilt in 1536, which nine years later came to an\r\nuntimely end off Brading. At the time of her oversetting she carried,\r\nin fact, both types of ordnance. In the Rotunda at Woolwich are to be\r\nseen some of the guns recovered from her wreck: a built-up wrought-iron\r\nbreech-loading stone-throwing gun on its baulk-of-timber carriage,\r\nidentical in character with a serpentine illustrated in Napoleon III’s\r\n_Études sur l’Artillerie_ as having been taken by the Swiss from\r\nCharles the Bold in A.D. 1476; and a bronze cannon royal (with John\r\nOwen’s name on it), demi-cannon, culverin, and culverin-bastard, all\r\nof them finished specimens of the founder’s art, and of an offensive,\r\ninstead of a merely defensive, value. “The system,” says Mr. Oppenheim\r\nof this growth of artillery armament, “was extended as the reign\r\nprogressed, and in 1546 we find comparatively small ships like the\r\n_Grand Mistress_ carrying two demi-cannon and five culverins, the\r\n_Swallow_ one demi-cannon and two demi-culverins, out of a total of\r\neight heavy guns; the _Anne Galant_ four culverins, one curtall, and\r\ntwo demi-culverins,” etc. etc.\r\n\r\nWhat were the dimensions of the various pieces? It is difficult to\r\ngive an exact answer. Owing to the continuous development of ordnance\r\nthroughout the century the pieces increased in size while they retained\r\ntheir class-names, and there is a wide variation between the table of\r\nordnance of Tartaglia, for instance, compiled in 1537, and those drawn\r\nup by English authors at the beginning of the seventeenth century.\r\nBriefly, we may note that pieces could be grouped in four classes:\r\nviz. cannons, culverins, periers, and mortars. The cannons were large\r\nin calibre and of medium length; the culverins were of great length,\r\nto give them high ranging power; the periers, or stone-throwers,\r\nwere a sort of howitzer; and the mortars, named probably from the\r\napothecary’s utensil to which they bore a resemblance, were squat\r\npieces used for projecting stones or iron balls at a high elevation.\r\nThe old stone-throwing serpentine was a gun weighing about 260 pounds,\r\nwhich fired a stone “as big as a swan’s egg.” The curtall, or curtlow\r\nwas (according to Mr. Oppenheim) a heavy gun of some 3000 pounds,\r\nhitherto only used as a siege-piece on land; “courtaulx” are mentioned\r\nby Napoleon III as having been, in A.D. 1498, fifty-pounders weighing\r\n5500 livres. The slings were large breech-loaders, probably of the\r\nperier class.\r\n\r\nWith the adoption of a more powerful armament not only did the old\r\npieces disappear, but a simplification of calibres ensued. France led\r\nthe way in the standardizing of calibres; about the year 1550 the\r\nFrench king Henri II introduced his six “calibres of France.” In the\r\nEnglish navy at this period several types were discarded, and a limit\r\nwas set to the size of the largest ship gun. “The report drawn up\r\nin 1559 tells us that there were 264 brass and 48 iron guns, all of\r\ncalibres down to falconets, on board the ships, and 48 brass and 8 iron\r\nin store.... The heaviest piece used on shipboard was the culverin of\r\n4500 lbs.; throwing a 17⅓ lb. ball with an extreme range of 2500 paces;\r\nthe next the demi-cannon weighing 4000 lbs. with a 30⅓ lb. ball and\r\nrange of 1700 paces; then the demi-culverin of 3400 lbs., a 9⅓ lb. ball\r\nand 2500 paces; and the cannon petroe, or perier, of 3000 lbs., 24¼-lb.\r\nball and 1600 paces. There were also sakers, minions, and falconets,\r\nbut culverins and demi-culverins were the most useful and became the\r\nfavourite ship guns. A contemporary wrote, ‘the founders never cast\r\nthem so exactly but that they differ two or three cwt. in a piece,’ and\r\nin a paper of 1564 the average weights of culverins, demi-culverins,\r\nand cannon periers are respectively 3300 lbs., 2500 lbs., and 2000\r\nlbs.”[50]\r\n\r\nSo far, cast iron had not come into general use. The large iron guns\r\nwere built up like the early Flemish bombards; the demi-cannons and\r\nculverins were all of brass. At the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign\r\nthere seems to have been an attempt to replace the expensive brass by\r\nthe cheaper cast iron, but later there was a reversion to brass, and\r\nit was not until the following century that cast iron was generally\r\nrecognized as a material for heavy ordnance, and then only for the\r\nheaviest types. Some technical considerations may help to indicate the\r\nchief factors which determined the material and the dimensions of the\r\nElizabethan ordnance.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1628, Robert Norton, in his book _The Gunner_, refers as\r\nfollows to the early Tudor ordnance. “Gun-founders about 100 or 150\r\nyears past,” he says, “did use to cast ordnance more poor, weak, and\r\nmuch slenderer fortified than now, both here and in foreign parts:\r\nalso the rather because saltpetre being either ill or not refined,\r\ntheir sulphur unclarified, their coals not of good wood, or else ill\r\nburnt, making therewith also their powder evilly receipted, slenderly\r\nwrought, and altogether uncorned, made it prove to be but weak (in\r\nrespect of the corned powder used now-a-days), wherefore they also\r\nmade their ordnance then accordingly (that is much weaker than now).\r\nFor the powder now being double or treble more than it was in force of\r\nrarification and quickness, requireth likewise to encrease the metal\r\ntwice or thrice more than before for each piece.” And, in fact, the\r\nweight of cannon increased in the period mentioned from eighty to two\r\nhundred times, the weight of culverins from a hundred to three hundred\r\ntimes, the weight of their shot. The slender large-bore built-up guns\r\nof the _Henry Grace à Dieu_ could only be used with a weak slow-burning\r\npowder. At the same time this slow-burning powder required, for its\r\ncomplete combustion, a great length of gun. These guns, such of them as\r\nwere breech-loaders, must have suffered from the leakage of gas at the\r\njoints of their primitive chambers; in the case of the smaller pieces a\r\nserious inefficiency was the excessive windage allowed between shot and\r\ngun. Until the end of the sixteenth century the windage bore no direct\r\nrelation to the diameter of the shot or bore of the gun: it was a fixed\r\namount, one quarter of an inch. The effect, therefore, of the leakage\r\nof powder gases past the shot, the loss in efficiency of discharge, was\r\ngreatest in the smallest guns.\r\n\r\nThe lines along which improvement lay were those which were taken.\r\nFirst, an elimination of the smallest guns. Second, a return to muzzle\r\nloading. Third, a strengthening of the powder by corning. Fourth, a\r\nfurther fortifying and a general augmenting of the weight of the cast\r\npieces, which had the double effect of giving the necessary strength\r\nto meet the stronger powders coming into use,[51] and of giving the\r\nextra mass required to minimize the violence of their recoil. Cast\r\niron could not yet compete with well-found brass for the guns required.\r\nDemi-cannon proved too unwieldy, and as Elizabeth’s reign progressed,\r\ngave place more and more to the long-ranging culverins, demi-culverins,\r\nand sakers, “which strained a ship less, were served more quickly\r\nand by fewer men, and permitted a heavier broadside in the same deck\r\nspace.”[52] As powder grew stronger the conditions improved; smaller\r\ncharges were necessary, windage had less effect, and, owing to the\r\nquicker combustion, it was possible to shorten the pieces without\r\ndetracting seriously from their ranging power; and this was done in\r\nthe Queen’s Navy, the guns being thereby made lighter and more easily\r\nmanipulated, while at the same time their projecting muzzles were less\r\nliable to entangle and interfere with the tackles of the sails.[53]\r\n\r\nThe substitution of the powerful, safe, and easily manipulated\r\ndemi-cannon and the long-ranging culverin and demi-culverin in place\r\nof the old chambered ordnance of the first half of the century made\r\npossible a new form of naval warfare. The cannon at last became,\r\nin the hands of the Elizabethan seaman, the chief instrument of\r\nbattle. Off-fighting was now feasible: a mode of action which largely\r\nneutralized the effects of an enemy’s superiority in size of ship or\r\nnumber of men, and which gave full scope and advantage to superior\r\nseamanship. Though no high standard of gunnery efficiency was then\r\npossible, yet it was the great superiority of the English gunfire,\r\nprincipally from the demi-culverins, the sakers, and the minions,\r\nover that of Spain, which conduced more than any other factor to the\r\ndispersal and subsequent flight of the Invincible Armada. The gun was\r\nthe weapon on which the English seaman had learnt to rely. It was the\r\ngun, plied with rapidity just out of pistol-shot of his lofty ships,\r\nwhich in the year 1588 harassed and put to confusion the Spaniard, the\r\nhaughty fighter who still maintained a quixotic contempt for the use of\r\ncannon and esteemed artillery “an ignoble arm.”[54] What a volume of\r\nfire was poured against him may be seen from a letter written by the\r\nadmiral, Lord Howard of Effingham: “All the world,” he writes, “never\r\nsaw such a force as theirs was; and some Spaniards that we have taken,\r\nthat were in the fight at Lepanto, do say that the worst of our four\r\nfights that we have had with them did exceed far the fight they had\r\nthere; and they say that at some of our fights we had twenty times as\r\nmuch great shot plied as they had there.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the founding of guns in cast iron had made progress. Cast\r\niron was cheap, and of a greater hardness and endurance than bronze,\r\nbut more like to crack and fly and endanger the crew, and requiring an\r\nenormous expenditure of wood-charcoal for its production. The use of\r\nmineral coal for iron smelting was not discovered until the following\r\ncentury, and even then, because of the opposition of the vested\r\ninterests, it was long before it displaced the use of timber. In the\r\nTudor times the iron and brass foundries were nearly all in the wooded\r\nsouth of England. The rivers of Sussex and Kent had for centuries\r\nbeen dammed to form hammer-ponds, and the sound of the tilt-hammers\r\nwas heard throughout these counties. To such an extent were the\r\nforests depleted of wood to form fuel for the Wealden foundries, that\r\nserious inroads were made on the available supplies of shipbuilding\r\ntimber; legislation was required in Elizabeth’s reign to prevent the\r\ncharcoal-burner from robbing the shipwright of his raw material.\r\n\r\nGun-founding, even in bronze, was still a somewhat primitive art.\r\nBut, once taught, the English founders soon excelled their teachers;\r\nand Norton’s eulogy, and the records of foreign efforts to obtain\r\npossession of English pieces, bear witness to the superiority of our\r\nworkmen. The products of the most famous founders of that time in\r\nEurope were very imperfect. “Some of their pieces (and not a few)\r\nare bored awry, their soul not lying in the midst of the body of\r\nmetal; some are crooked in their chase, others of unequal bores, some\r\ntoo light towards the breech turn their mouths downwards in their\r\ndischarge, and so endanger their own vawmures and defences; others\r\nare too heavy also in their breach, by placing the trunnions too much\r\nafterwards, that coynes can hardly be drawn.... Some are come forth\r\nof the furnace spongey, or full of honeycombs and flaws, by reason\r\nthat the metal runneth not fine, or that the moulds are not thoroughly\r\ndryed, or well nealed.... Yet thus much I dare say to the due\r\ncommendations of our English gunfounders, that the ordnance which they\r\nof late years have cast, as well for neatness, as also for reasonable\r\nbestowing and disposing of the metal, they have far excelled all the\r\nformer and foreign aforementioned founders.” Norton, a land gunner, was\r\nhere referring to brass ordnance, alone used on shore.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting witness to the success of the English\r\ngunfounders is Sir Walter Raleigh, who in his _Discourses_ rebuked the\r\ndetestable covetousness of those licensed to sell ordnance abroad. So\r\ngreat was the number of pieces exported, that all other nations were\r\nequipped with good English artillery for ships and forts and coast\r\ndefence. “Without which,” he remarks, “the Spanish King durst not have\r\ndismounted so many pieces of brass in Naples and elsewhere, therewith\r\nto arm his great fleet in ’88. But it was directly proved in the lower\r\nhouse of parliament of Queen Elizabeth, that there were landed in\r\nNaples above 140 culverins English.... It is lamentable that so many\r\nhave been transported into Spain.”\r\n\r\nIn 1589 Lord Buckhurst wrote to the justices of Lewes Rape, complaining\r\nof their neglect in permitting the surreptitious export of ordnance.\r\n“Their lordships do see the little regard the owners of furnaces and\r\nthe makers of these pieces have of their bonds, and how it importeth\r\nthe state that the enemy of her Majesty should not be furnished out of\r\nthe land with ordnance to annoy us.”\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, in short, that some of the Armada’s cannon had\r\nbeen moulded and poured on English soil.\r\n\r\nThe imperfection of the sixteenth-century foundry products may\r\nbe gauged from Bourne’s evidence that the use of cartridges was\r\ninconvenient because, on account of honeycombs and flaws, “you shall\r\nscant get the cartridge home unto the bottom of the piece.” On the\r\nother hand loading by ladle was still considered dangerous. In his\r\n_Art of Gunnery_, of 1627, Thos. Smith, soldier, of Berwick-on-Tweed,\r\nwarns the gunner always to stand to one side of the mouth of the piece\r\nwhen thrusting home the ladle; otherwise, the charge being ignited by\r\nsmouldering débris in the cavities of the metal, it takes fire and\r\nkills the loader--“as happened in Anno 1573 at the siege of Edinborough\r\nCastle, to two experienced gunners.”[55] At about the same date\r\nas Smith’s book was written, Sir H. Manwayring, in _The Sea-Man’s\r\nDictionary_, described the “arming” of cross-bar shot: i.e. the binding\r\nthem with oakum, yarn, or cloth, to prevent their ends from catching\r\nhold in any flaws during their passage through the gun, which might\r\nbreak it.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nUnder the Stuart kings a continuous development of ship armament took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis development was not always in the right direction. The Commission\r\nof Reform of the year 1618 recorded, as we have already seen, the\r\nimportance of artillery in naval warfare, but owing to the absence\r\nof all system it was long before the principle found effective\r\napplication. Owing to divided authority, or to a lack of unity in the\r\nconception of the fighting ship, a tendency to excess in the number and\r\nweight of guns continued to be noticeable, an excess which was to react\r\nunfavourably on the performances of our ships both in the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nProgress was made in the classification of pieces and in the reduction\r\nof the number of different types carried; a change was also made in\r\nthe forms of the guns, in order to enhance the fighting value of the\r\ngun armament in certain circumstances. The great guns were made still\r\nshorter than before; the quicker-burning powders now in use allowed\r\nthis to be done. By which expedient the ratio between gun-weight\r\nand weight-of-metal-thrown was reduced; more guns could be carried\r\nfor a given weight of metal; they could be more easily manipulated;\r\nand if they were of small ranging power they yet possessed a power\r\nof penetration sufficient for close-quarter fighting. Moreover, the\r\nreduction in length enabled an increase in calibre to be made; and this\r\nwas one of the factors which led to the reintroduction of larger types\r\nthan had formerly been considered suitable: the cannon-serpentine, the\r\ncannon, and even the cannon-royal, with its sixty-six pound shot and\r\nits eight thousand pounds of metal.[56]\r\n\r\nIn the Dutch Wars the preponderance in the size and weight of the\r\nunit shot lay with the English ships, and was in itself undoubtedly\r\na great advantage in their favour; though complaints were made of\r\nthe great weight and clumsiness of the pieces, “which caused much of\r\nthe straining and rolling at sea.” Writing of naval ordnance in the\r\nyear 1690, Sir Cloudesley Shovell recorded that, “our lower-deck guns\r\nare too big and the tackles ill fitted with blocks, which makes them\r\nwork heavy; the Dutch who have light guns have lignum vitæ sheaves.\r\nThe Dutch guns are seldom larger than twenty-four pounders.” By this\r\ntime, it will be noted, the more scientific nomenclature had come into\r\nvogue; the cannon-petro was now known as the 24-pounder, and the heavy\r\nlower-deck guns referred to were the old bastard-cannons, known since\r\nthe reorganization of the Commonwealth navy as 42-pounders.\r\n\r\nThe founding of guns continued to be, throughout the seventeenth\r\ncentury, an affair of private enterprise. Proof was carried out under\r\nthe supervision of the Board of Ordnance.\r\n\r\nIn 1619 a decree was issued that gun-founding was to be confined\r\nto Kent and Sussex, that guns were to be landed at or shipped from\r\nthe Tower Wharf only, and that East Smithfield was to be the one\r\nmarket-place for their sale or purchase. Guns could be proved only\r\nin Ratcliff fields, and all pieces were to have on them at least two\r\nletters of the founder’s name, with the year and the weight of the gun.\r\nExportation was illegal; nevertheless the illicit traffic went on just\r\nas in Elizabeth’s time. The royal forts themselves were turned into\r\nmarts for these and other unlawful transactions, and Upnor Castle is\r\ndescribed as having been “a staple of stolen goods, a den of thieves, a\r\nvent for the transport of ordnance.”[57]\r\n\r\nIn later years proof took place at other government grounds, all\r\nwithin the London area. In Moorfields, according to Stowe, was the\r\nArtillery Yard, “whereunto the gunners of the Tower do weekly repair;\r\nand there, levelling certain brass pieces of great artillery against\r\na butt of earth made for that purpose, they discharge them for their\r\nexercise.”[58] Spitalfields also had its artillery butts. “Where\r\nLiverpool-street Station now stands the Tower gunners of Elizabeth’s\r\nday had their yard, and there discharged great pieces of artillery for\r\nexercise, while throughout the seventeenth century guns were both cast\r\nand tested in the vicinity, as Gun-street, Fort-street, and Artillery\r\nLane hard by serve to remind us. Finsbury Field, levelled for an\r\narchery ground in 1498, passed from the London archers to the London\r\ngunners, and, as the Honourable Artillery Company’s Ground, survives to\r\ncarry on the long traditions of the spot.”[59]\r\n\r\nUnder the Commonwealth progress was made in the quality of gunpowder,\r\nand improved methods were introduced of testing it for strength\r\nand uniformity. This advance had its effect on the guns. Failures\r\nwere frequent, and, in spite of improved founding, pieces had to be\r\nmade heavier than before; cast iron in particular was found unequal\r\nto withstanding the stresses caused by the improved powders, and\r\nthis metal came into such disfavour that a whole century elapsed\r\nbefore it was again accepted as suitable by both naval and military\r\nartillerists. Founding in bronze had undergone improvement. Malthus, an\r\nEnglishman who had risen in the French service to be Director of their\r\nArtillery,[60] mentions in his _Pratique de la Guerre_, as evidence of\r\nthis improvement, the fact that in breaking up old pieces lumps of free\r\ntin and copper were frequently discovered, whereas in the case of new\r\nguns the metal was invariably found well-mixed.\r\n\r\nSomewhere between the years 1665 and 1680--presumably later than\r\n1667--the proof of ordnance was transferred from Moorfields to the\r\nnaval depôt at Woolwich, and the nerves of the metropolis were no\r\nlonger shaken by the roar of pieces loaded with powder charges equal,\r\nfor proof, to one-and-a-half times the weight of the shots themselves.\r\nA proof-master and “his Majesty’s founder of brass and iron ordnance”\r\nwere instituted to supervise and advise the various contractors. The\r\nState did not at first take over the work of casting its own guns. But\r\nin 1716 an event occurred which brought about the formation of the\r\nRoyal Gun Factory, and the manufacture of both land and sea ordnance\r\nby the state. A disastrous accident occurred in the City of London. It\r\nhappened that, after the peace of Utrecht in 1713, the guns captured by\r\nMarlborough from the French had been exhibited outside the Moorfields\r\nfoundry. Three years later they were still there, and, the national\r\nordnance being much depleted by the late wars, it was resolved to\r\nrecast these pieces and so utilise their metal. On the appointed date a\r\nlarge concourse of the public attended to witness the operation. Late\r\nat night the metal was poured. A big explosion ensued, owing to the use\r\nof damp moulds, and a number of people were killed and injured.\r\n\r\nTo avoid a recurrence of such an accident it was decided that the\r\ngovernment should possess a brass foundry of their own. The services of\r\nan able foreigner, Andrew Schalk of Douai, were sought, and the Royal\r\nFoundry at Woolwich was established with Schalk as master founder. The\r\nchange was a complete success, and Schalk held the position for the\r\nnext sixty years. Some of his guns, cast in the year 1742, were raised\r\nfrom the “Royal George” in 1840.[61]\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the eighteenth century the processes of gunnery had\r\nbeen placed for the first time on a scientific foundation; by whom, and\r\nin what manner, we shall describe in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThe design of guns had by this time become subject to more scientific\r\nconsideration than had hitherto been bestowed, and their manufacture\r\nhad been improved by the Swiss invention of the boring machine, which\r\nenabled them to be cast solid instead of being cast hollow on a core.\r\nIron guns came more and more into favour as the century progressed,\r\nespecially for naval use. The cost of iron was only one-eighth that of\r\nbrass. The art of casting iron in homogeneous masses had by this time\r\nmade progress, and though hitherto it had been the custom to make iron\r\nordnance of great thickness and weight, repeated trial proved that they\r\ncould be made lighter, if required, without undue loss of strength, and\r\nthat in action they outlasted brass ordnance, which cracked, bent at\r\nthe muzzle, and wore out at the vent. A well-made iron gun was almost\r\nindestructible. At the siege of Belleisle, in the Seven Years’ War, the\r\nbrass guns soon wore out, and had to be replaced by iron ship guns;\r\nand it was long, indeed, before a suitable brass was discovered, which\r\nwould withstand the repeated fire of large charges without losing its\r\ntin-element and degenerating into a spongy and craterous material.\r\nMuller, in his _Treatise of Artillery_, of 1768, described how he had\r\nseen cast iron at the Carron works so tough that “it would flatten\r\nand tear like brass”; and advocated iron guns of a new and light\r\nconstruction to replace Schalk’s brass guns forming the armament of the\r\n_Royal George_, and give a saving in weight of over a hundred and sixty\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRENCH TWENTY-FOUR-POUNDER WITH SPHERICAL CHAMBER\r\n\r\nFrom St. Remy’s _Mémoires_]\r\n\r\nIn respect of design, the newly acquired knowledge of the true\r\nprinciples governing internal ballistics began gradually, in the\r\nlatter part of the century, to show its effect. Hitherto, ever since\r\ngunpowder had been in military use, pieces had been cast in masses\r\nof varying size and shape and ornamented to please the fancy of the\r\nfounder. Cannon had been made with double or triple reinforces of\r\nmetal, so that their exterior surface was stepped longitudinally from\r\nmuzzle to breech. Experience probably pointed out on many occasions\r\nthe bad design of a piece whose sections showed sudden alterations in\r\nshape; but it was not till after the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nthat this consideration was discussed by a professional. “Since powder\r\nacts uniformly and not by starts it is hard to judge from whence this\r\nridiculous custom has arisen.... There should be no breakings in the\r\nmetal.” The piece, continues Muller, should be of cylindrical bore, and\r\nits outer contour should be a curve slightly concave, corresponding\r\npresumably to the curve of the powder pressure. But as this curve would\r\nbe difficult to find, he recommends a sloping straight line from breech\r\nto muzzle as sufficiently exact for practical purposes.\r\n\r\nInnumerable experiments were made in the first half of this century\r\nwith a view to improving the efficiency of combustion in guns, and\r\nmuch argument centred round such subjects as the shape of the chamber\r\nand the position of the vent. In France pieces were adopted having\r\nspherical chambers: it being proved that, with the charge concentrated\r\nin a spherical cavity, as much power could be obtained as from a larger\r\nand heavier flush-chambered gun. But such pieces were dangerous. Not\r\nonly was their recoil so violent as to break their carriages, but\r\nmany good gunners lost their arms while charging chambers in which\r\nsmouldering debris lay hidden. The spherical chamber was abandoned.[62]\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the design and manufacture of guns has now entered\r\nthe scientific stage. Art there still is, but it lies below the\r\nsurface. The old “vain ornaments” preserved by tradition are thrown\r\naway: the scrolls, mouldings, and excrescences which broke the surface\r\nof the metal; the ogees, fillets, and astragals which ran riot over the\r\nproducts of some foundries; the muzzle swells which by their weight\r\ncaused the chase to droop; the grotesque cascabels. All mouldings, said\r\nMuller, should be as plain and simple as possible; the trunnions should\r\nbe on the axis of the piece; the windage of all types of guns should be\r\nsmaller, and there should be more moderation in the charges used.\r\n\r\nIn time all these improvements came. The smooth-bore gun, strengthened\r\nand simplified, preserved its establishment in the navy far into the\r\nnineteenth century, as will later appear. For the present we must\r\nconfine ourselves to noting that, in the final stages of its evolution\r\nit received improvement in form from two distinguished artillerists\r\nwhose influence was progressive in the whole realm of gunnery: Generals\r\nCongreve[63] and Blomefield.[64] There is yet another eminent officer\r\nof this period to whom the navy owes a debt incalculable: Who can\r\nassess the value of the work done by General Sir Howard Douglas in his\r\nclassic treatise on Naval Gunnery?\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing survey of the evolution of heavy ordnance we now\r\nappend a few notes on the evolution of the material of purely land\r\nartillery: from which it will be seen that, while the intensive\r\ncompetition of great armies resulted in much of this latter evolution\r\noriginating among the continental powers, the share of this country in\r\ninitiating improvement was, in the latter years, by no means negligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIt will be noted by the student of European history as significant,\r\nthat superiority of artillery material has almost invariably marched\r\nwith national power. Thus in the past the evolution of artillery has\r\nbeen the monopoly of no one nation; it has been progressed by each in\r\nturn; each in turn has attained superiority, and each has contributed\r\nsomething of importance to it, in the day of its greatness.\r\n\r\nTwo ancient and preventable practices seem to have operated in chief\r\nmeasure to retard the progressive development of a mobile land\r\nartillery: first, the custom of setting the trunnions of a gun at\r\nan appreciable distance below the horizontal plane of the gun-axis;\r\nsecond, the custom of making small pieces relatively longer than those\r\nof larger calibre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From Binning’s _A Light to the Art of Gunnery_, A.D.\r\n1689]\r\n\r\nThe first guns had no trunnions. To obtain the requisite angle of\r\nelevation the piece was laid in a dug-out trunk or carriage and this\r\ncarriage was set on trestles; in which manner, it appears, the English\r\nat the siege of Orleans in A.D. 1428 “threw into the town from their\r\nbombards large numbers of stones which, flying over the walls, smashed\r\nin the roofs of houses.”[65] During the fifteenth century trunnions\r\ncame into use, and the carriages were mounted on wheels. In his\r\n_Introduction of Artillery into Switzerland_ a French writer, Colonel\r\nMassé, has given an account of the early evolution of an artillery\r\nof position, as used by the Swiss and their enemies in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The huge siege bombards, possessed by most of the great\r\ncities at the end of the fourteenth century, were too cumbrous for\r\ntransport. Built up of welded and coiled iron, and therefore without\r\ntrunnions, they were replaced, toward A.D. 1443, by lighter pieces\r\non wheeled carriages. And before the Burgundian War “coulevrines de\r\ncampagne” were being cast in Switzerland, of bronze, with trunnions\r\nto give each piece an elevation independently of its carriage. Relics\r\nare still preserved which show the gun-trunnion in its early stages,\r\nas embodied in the Burgundian artillery of Charles the Bold. The\r\nfirst method of obtaining elevation for the gun was by hinges or\r\ntrunnions on the front of the carriage or trunk, in combination with\r\na curved rack erected on the trail for supporting the rear end. Then\r\nthe trunk disappeared; the trunnions were cast on the gun, whose\r\ncascabel was supported by a cross-pin between the flanks of the trail;\r\nand then the cross-pin was made removable, and a series of holes was\r\nprovided for its reception, to give the elevation desired. At first\r\nthese trunnions were cast level with the gun axis; in Napoleon III’s\r\ntreatise on artillery is a picture of a trunnion gun taken by the\r\nSwiss from Charles the Bold in 1476, and another of a cannon of Louis\r\nXI, cast in 1478, and in both cases the trunnions are level with the\r\ngun axis. But pieces cast later almost invariably had their trunnions\r\nset on a level with the bottom of the bore; partly, perhaps, for the\r\ninsignificant reason given by Norton--that “lying somewhat under the\r\nconcave cylinder of the bore they will the better support the great\r\nweight”--but primarily to ensure a downward pressure on the quoin or\r\ntrail when discharge took place. The effect of this trivial alteration\r\nwas enormous. The impulse of the recoil was given a moment about the\r\ntrunnion axis which, as the force of powders increased, produced an\r\nincreasingly great downward pressure on the trail. Carriages, though\r\nmade of massive scantlings, frequently broke; nor was it till the\r\nlatter half of the eighteenth century that the cause was removed, the\r\ntrunnions being raised nearer the axes of the guns and the carriages\r\nbeing thereby relieved of the excessive cross-strains which they had\r\nborne for nearly three hundred years. Muller, in his Artillery, refers\r\nto the “absurd method” of placing the trunnions so low and, in the year\r\n1768, points out the advantages to be gained by raising them. “Writers\r\ndo not appear to have had any idea,” says Favé, “of the effect which\r\nthe position of the trunnions had on the stressing of the carriage.”\r\nScharnhorst the Prussian gives as an important advantage to be gained\r\nby raising the trunnions, the larger wheels which could be employed\r\nwithout adding to the height of the gun above the ground.\r\n\r\nProgress was also checked by the great length given to the smaller\r\nvarieties of cannon. With the fine powder of the Middle Ages a great\r\nlength of barrel was necessary to ensure complete combustion, and such\r\nprimitive observations as were made all seemed to prove that, the\r\nlonger the barrel the greater the range. But with the introduction of\r\ncorned powder a reduction in length should have been possible. No such\r\nchange was made. Tradition had consecrated long guns, and official\r\nstandardization of types afterwards helped to oppose any innovation in\r\nthis respect until the eighteenth century, with few exceptions.\r\n\r\nTo Charles V of Spain belongs the credit for the first systematic\r\nclassification of guns. In his hands artillery had, for the first time,\r\nbecome an efficient instrument of battle in land campaigns, and all\r\nEurope saw that, in his batteries of bronze trunnion-guns, on wheeled\r\ncarriages, firing cast-iron balls against foe or crumbling masonry, a\r\nnew power had arisen.[66] The emperor, experiencing the inconvenience\r\nof a multiplicity of types and calibres, sought to simplify his\r\nmaterial. Accordingly, in the year 1544 or shortly before, he approved\r\nseven models to which all pieces in use throughout the vast possessions\r\nof the Spanish monarchy were thenceforth to conform. These seven types\r\ncomprised a cannon (a 40-pounder), a cannon-moyen (24-pounder), two\r\n12-pounder culverins, two 6-pounder culverins, and a 3-pounder falcon.\r\n\r\nThe French soon improved on Charles’ example. The oldest patterns\r\nof their cannon, according to a table given by St. Remy in his\r\n_Mémoires_, were of a uniform length of ten feet. In A.D. 1550 Henri II\r\nissued an edict restricting the number of different calibres to six,\r\nnamed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Canon, a 33-pounder, 10½ feet long, weighing 5200 livres, drawn by\r\n        21 horses.\r\n\r\n    Grande coulevrine, a 15-pounder, 11 feet long, weighing 4000\r\n        livres, drawn by 17 horses.\r\n\r\n    Coulevrine bâtarde, a 7-pounder, 9 feet long, weighing 2500 livres,\r\n        drawn by 11 horses.\r\n\r\n    Coulevrine moyenne, a 2-pounder, 8½ feet long, weighing 1200\r\n        livres, drawn by 4 horses.\r\n\r\n    Faucon, a 1-pounder, 7½ feet long, weighing 700 livres, drawn by 3\r\n        horses.\r\n\r\n    Fauconneau, a ¾-pounder, 7 feet long, weighing 410 livres, drawn by\r\n        2 horses.\r\n\r\nThese dimensions are only a rough approximation. In the year 1584 two\r\nother types, found useful by the Spaniards in the Low Countries, were\r\nincluded--a 12- and a 24-pounder.\r\n\r\nThe relatively greater lengths of the small pieces will be noted. As\r\nit was with the French, so it was with other nations, and the list of\r\nItalian ordnance given in Tartaglia’s _Art of Shooting_ shows a general\r\nresemblance to that of Henri II. The desire for a maximum of ranging\r\npower, and the necessity of making the smaller pieces long enough to\r\nenter the embrasures of fortifications, and strong enough to fire\r\nmany more rounds than those of the largest size, tended to cause an\r\naugmentation in their size and weight; difficulties of transport had an\r\neffect in imposing a limit of weight on the largest guns which in the\r\ncase of the smaller pieces did not operate to the same degree.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the French possessed, from 1550 onwards, an organized\r\nartillery suitable for transport on campaigns. The six calibres were\r\nmounted on wheeled carriages, horse-drawn, from which they could be\r\nfired; they were moved, muzzles foremost, with their ponderous trails\r\ndragging on the ground in rear.\r\n\r\nAt that point French artillery remained, or with little advance beyond\r\nit, until the middle of the eighteenth century. In the Germanic states,\r\non the other hand, important progress was made: by the end of the\r\nsixteenth century shorter pieces, shell-fire from mortars, and the use\r\nof elevated fire for varying ranges, had been adopted. But the chief\r\ncentre of artillery progress at the end of the sixteenth century was\r\nthe Low Countries, then in the thick of their warfare with Spain. “In\r\ntheir glorious struggle for independence their artillery contrived to\r\navail itself of the latest and best theory and practice, to employ\r\ncannons and carriages of simplicity and uniformity; and it has endowed\r\nthe art of war with two inventions of the first order--the hand-grenade\r\nand the bomb.”[67]\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the seventeenth century the genius of Gustavus\r\nAdolphus gave a new value to land ordnance. He made it mobile. He\r\ndivided his artillery into two categories, Siege and Field, and for the\r\nlatter devised the famous light “leather guns” which, operating in mass\r\non certain points, had an important effect on the issue of battles.\r\nBut after his death at Lützen in 1632 the effort to attain mobility\r\nrelaxed; an increase in the strength of powders at this time rendered\r\nthe possibility still more remote; and it was not until the following\r\ncentury that the Prussians, under Frederick the Great, evolved a\r\nsatisfactory light artillery. Both in Prussia and in Austria great\r\nefforts were made, in the middle of the eighteenth century, to evolve\r\na mobile and efficient ordnance. The Seven Years’ War found the former\r\nstate experimenting with pieces varying in weight between eighty and a\r\nhundred and fifty times the weight of their ball; and in 1762 a certain\r\nFrench observer, who was destined to become famous as one of the great\r\nartillery reformers of all time, wrote letters from Vienna describing\r\nthe fine qualities of the Austrian service: with its pieces all sixteen\r\ncalibres in length, all 115 times their balls in weight, all bored to\r\ntheir true nominal dimensions, and firing accurately spherical balls\r\nof correct size, with a small windage and a powder-charge of less than\r\none-third the weight of the shot.\r\n\r\nIn the years immediately following the close of the Seven Years’\r\nWar the lessons learned at Vienna were translated into practice in\r\nFrance. By 1765 Gribeauval had begun his reorganization of the French\r\nmaterial. In order to obtain mobility he made new models of 12, 8, and\r\n4-pounders, very plain, unchambered pieces, each eighteen calibres\r\nin length, 150 times its own shot in weight, and firing well-fitting\r\nballs with unprecedented precision, with powder-charges of one-third\r\nthe weight of the balls. Limbers, in the form of small-trucked bogies,\r\nhad been in occasional use ever since the sixteenth century. Gribeauval\r\nintroduced large-wheeled limbers, and dragged his 12-pounders by six,\r\nhis 8- and 4-pounders by four horses. From the number of horses, as\r\ncompared with that of the edict of Henri II, one can measure the\r\nprogress made in two centuries. The whole of Gribeauval’s material\r\nwas designed to afford rapid transport and rapid and accurate fire;\r\ninterchangeability of wheels and other parts formed a novel and\r\nimportant element of the standardization which he accomplished. Iron\r\naxle-trees, cartridges (used with effect by Gustavus in the preceding\r\ncentury), elevating screws, tangent scales, and other improvements were\r\nadopted under his authority. But, “Gribeauval could not force on France\r\nthe two great inventions of the century--the limber-box and the Horse\r\nArtillery.”[68]\r\n\r\nThe horse, or flying, artillery, designed to be attached to, and\r\nsupported by, cavalry, as field or foot artillery was attached to\r\ninfantry, was a Prussian invention. It was adopted by France after the\r\noutbreak of the Revolution, and almost simultaneously it appeared in\r\nthe British army.[69]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the century all the great Powers had adopted Gribeauval’s\r\nsystem in most of its important parts: notably in the grouping of\r\nartillery into the three categories--siege, field, and coast defence.\r\nProgress continued. In the opening years of the next century a\r\nnew competitor among the Powers began to attract attention by its\r\nproficiency. “In the first campaigns of the Revolution the English\r\nartillery showed itself less advanced than that of several other\r\npowers. But so well did it succeed in ameliorating its condition that\r\nwhen it reappeared on the Continent to take an active part in the\r\nPeninsular War it was seen to be itself worthy in its turn to serve as\r\na model.”\r\n\r\nThis is the tribute paid by Colonel Favé.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from his further remarks that the English artillery\r\nsurprised its adversaries, not only by its superior mobility, but\r\nby the effectiveness of its innovations, two of which, especially,\r\nproved to be inventions of the first order--Shrapnel’s projectiles and\r\nCongreve’s war-rockets. France recognized the high efficiency of its\r\nopponent artillery, and some years later adopted a material embodying\r\nsome of its most important features. Experiments were made, and\r\ncomparative trials carried out, with modified English and modified\r\nGribeauval equipments. The former were preferred, and a new series of\r\ndesigns was introduced and approved: this becoming known as “the system\r\nof 1827.”\r\n\r\nThree years later war experience led to investigations in France\r\nwhich caused a revolution in artillery material. In a few years’ time\r\nsmooth-bore cannon were being converted to rifles, for use both on land\r\nand sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE STEAM ENGINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greatest of the world’s inventions appear to have had a very casual\r\nbirth. So much an affair of chance has been their first manifestation,\r\nthat science has not been called in aid; no law can be discerned which\r\nmight govern the time and sequence of their coming; they seem to have\r\nbeen stumbled on, unpedigreed offspring of accident and time. A monk of\r\nMetz discovers gunpowder. “Surely,” says Fuller, “ingenuity may seem\r\ntransposed, and to have crossed her hands, when about the same time\r\na soldier found out printing.” “It should seem,” writes Lord Bacon,\r\n“that hitherto men are rather beholden to a wild goat for surgery, or\r\nto a nightingale for music, or to the ibis for some part of physic, or\r\nto the pot-lid that flew open for artillery, or generally to chance,\r\nor anything else, than to logic for the invention of the Arts and\r\nSciences.” So it seemed. And in due time the legend of the pot-lid\r\nwas woven round the unfortunate Marquis of Worcester, who, tradition\r\nhad it, made the discovery of the steam engine by observation of the\r\nstew-pot in which, when confined a prisoner in the Tower, he was\r\nengaged in cooking his dinner. At a later date and in another form the\r\nstory was connected with James Watt.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the story of the discovery of the steam engine is far more\r\ninspiring. The history of the application of steam to human use is\r\nalmost the history of science itself; the stages of its development are\r\nclearly marked for us; and the large succession of these stages, and\r\nthe calibre of the minds which contributed to the achievement of the\r\nperfected steam engine, are some measure of the essential complexity\r\nof what is to-day regarded as a comparatively simple machine. For the\r\nsteam engine was not the gift of any particular genius or generation;\r\nit did not leap from any one man’s brain. Some of the greatest names\r\nin the history of human knowledge can claim a share in its discovery.\r\nFrom philosopher to scientist, from scientist to engineer the grand\r\nidea was carried on, gradually taking more and more concrete form,\r\nuntil finally, in an age when by the diffusion of knowledge the labours\r\nof all three were for the first time co-ordinated, it was brought\r\nto maturity. A new force of nature was harnessed which wrought a\r\nrevolution in the civilized world.\r\n\r\nAn attempt is made in this chapter to chronicle the circumstances under\r\nwhich the successive developments of the steam engine took place. The\r\nprogress of the scientific ideas which led up to the discovery of the\r\npower of steam is traced. The claims of the various inventors chiefly\r\nassociated with the steam engine are set forth in some detail, not for\r\nthe difficult and invidious task of assessing their relative merits,\r\nbut because by the light of these claims and altercations it may be\r\npossible to discern, in each case, where the merit lay and to what\r\nstage each novelty of idea or detail properly belonged. From this point\r\nof view, it is thought, the recital of circumstances which hitherto\r\nhave been thought so trivial as to be scarcely worthy of record, may be\r\nof some suggestive value. The result of the investigation is to make\r\nclear the scientific importance of the steam engine: the steam engine\r\nregarded, not as the familiar drudge and commonplace servant of to-day,\r\nbut in all its dignity of a thermodynamic machine, that scientific\r\ndevice which embodied so much of the natural philosophy of the age\r\nwhich first unveiled it--the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nBefore the Christian era steam had been used to do mechanical work.\r\nIn a treatise, _Pneumatica_, written by Hero of Alexandria about 130\r\nB.C., mention is made of a primitive reaction turbine, which functioned\r\nby the reactionary force of steam jets thrown off tangentially from\r\nthe periphery of a wheel. In the same work another form of heat-engine\r\nis described: an apparatus in which, by the expansion from heating of\r\nair contained in a spherical vessel, water was expelled from the same\r\nvessel to a bucket, where by its weight it gave motion mysteriously\r\nto the doors of temples. And evidence exists that in these two forms\r\nheat engines were used in later centuries for such trivial purposes as\r\nthe blowing of organs and the turning of spits. But except in these\r\ntwo primitive forms no progress is recorded for seventeen centuries\r\nafter the date of Hero’s book. The story of the evolution of steam as a\r\nmotive force really begins, with the story of modern science itself, at\r\nthe end of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nWith the great revival of learning which took place in Southern Europe\r\nin the latter part of the fifteenth century new light came to be thrown\r\non the classical philosophies which still ruled men’s minds, and modern\r\nscience was born. New views on natural phenomena began to irradiate,\r\nand, sweeping aside the myths and traditions which surrounded and\r\nstifled them, the votaries of the “new science” began to formulate\r\nopinions of the boldest and most unorthodox description.[70] The true\r\nlaws of the equilibrium of fluids, discovered originally by Archimedes,\r\nwere rediscovered by Stevinus. By the end of the sixteenth century the\r\nnature of the physical universe was become a pursuit of the wisest men.\r\nTo Galileo himself was due, perhaps, the first distinct conception of\r\nthe power of steam or any other gas to do mechanical work; for “he,\r\nthe Archimedes of his age, first clearly grasped the idea of force as\r\na mechanical agent, and extended to the external world the conception\r\nof the invariability of the relation between cause and effect.”[71]\r\nTo his brilliant pupil Torricelli the questioning world was indebted\r\nfor the experiments which showed the true nature of the atmosphere,\r\nand for the theory he proclaimed that the atmosphere by its own weight\r\nexerted its fluid pressure--a theory which Pascal soon confirmed by the\r\nfamous ascent of his barometer up the Puy-de-Dôme, which demonstrated\r\nthat the pressure supporting his column of mercury grew less as the\r\nascent proceeded. Giovanni della Porta, in a treatise on pneumatics\r\npublished in the year 1601, had already made two suggestions of the\r\nfirst importance. Discussing Hero’s door-opening apparatus, della\r\nPorta showed that steam might be substituted for air as the expanding\r\nmedium, and that, by condensing steam in a closed vessel, water might\r\nbe sucked up from a lower level by virtue of the vacuum so formed. And\r\na few years later, in 1615, Solomon de Caus, a French engineer, had\r\ncome to England with a scheme almost identical with della Porta’s, and\r\nactually constructed a plant which forced up water to a height by means\r\nof steam. Shortly afterwards the “new science” received an accession of\r\ninterest from the invention, by Otto von Guericke of Magdeburg, of a\r\nsuction pump by which the atmospheric air could be abstracted from a\r\nclosed vessel.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of this century the learned of all European countries had\r\nbeen attracted by the knowledge gained of the material universe. In\r\nEngland the secrets of science were attacked with enthusiasm under the\r\nnew strategy of Lord Bacon, enunciated in his _Novum Organum_. The new\r\nphilosophy was patronised by royalty itself, and studied by a company\r\nof brilliant men of whom the leading physicist was Robert Boyle, soon\r\nfamous for his law connecting the volumes and the pressures of gases.\r\nIn France, too, a great enthusiasm for science took birth. A group of\r\nmen, of whom the most eminent was Christian Huyghens, banded themselves\r\ntogether to further scientific inquiry into the phenomena of nature\r\nand to demolish the reigning myths and fallacies: they also working\r\nadmittedly by the experimental method of Bacon.\r\n\r\nThe time was ripe, however, for wider recognition of these scientists\r\nand the grand object of their labours. Within a short time the two\r\ngroups were both given the charter of their respective countries;\r\nin France they were enrolled as the Royal Academy of Sciences; in\r\nEngland, as the Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge. In\r\nother countries societies of a similar kind were formed, but their\r\ninfluence was not comparable with that exerted by the societies of\r\nLondon and Paris. Between these two a correspondence was started which\r\nafterwards developed into one of the most famous of publications:\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_. In England, especially, the Royal\r\nSociety served from its inception as a focus for all the great minds\r\nof the day, and in time brought together such men as Newton, Wren,\r\nHooke, Wallis, Boyle--not to mention his majesty King Charles himself;\r\nwho, with the best intentions, could not always take seriously the\r\nspeculations of the savants. “Gresham College he mightily laughed at,”\r\nnoted Mr. Pepys in his diary for the first of February, 1663, “for\r\nspending time only in weighing of ayre, and doing nothing else since\r\nthey sat.” A year later Pepys was himself admitted a member of the\r\ndistinguished company, and found it “a most acceptable thing to hear\r\ntheir discourse, and see their experiments, which were this day on\r\nfire, and how it goes out in a place where the air is not free, and\r\nsooner out in a place where the ayre is exhausted, which they showed by\r\nan engine on purpose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn the year 1663, just after the formation of the Royal Society, a\r\nsmall book was published by the Marquis of Worcester, _A Century of the\r\nNames and Scantlings of such Inventions as he had tried and perfected_.\r\n\r\nOf these inventions one, the sixty-eighth, is thus described:\r\n\r\n“An admirable and most forcible way to drive up water by fire, not by\r\ndrawing or sucking it upwards, for that must be as the Philosopher\r\ncalleth it, _Intra sphæram activitatis_, which is but at such a\r\ndistance. But this way hath no bounder, if the vessels be strong\r\nenough; for I have taken a piece of a whole cannon, whereof the end\r\nwas burst, and filled it three-quarters full of water, stopping and\r\nscrewing up the broken end, as also the touch-hole; and making a\r\nconstant fire under it, within twenty-four hours it burst and made a\r\ngreat crack. So that having a way to make my vessels, so that they are\r\nstrengthened by the force within them, and the one to fill after the\r\nother; I have seen the water run like a constant fountain-stream forty\r\nfoot high; one vessel of water rarified by fire driveth up forty of\r\ncold water. And a man that tends the work is but to turn two cocks,\r\nthat one vessel of water being consumed, another begins to force and\r\nrefill with cold water, and so successfully, the fire being tended\r\nand kept constant, which the selfsame person may likewise abundantly\r\nperform in the interim between the necessity of turning the said cocks.”\r\n\r\nOn this evidence the claim is made that the marquis was the original\r\ninventor of the steam engine. Is he at all entitled to the honour? The\r\nwhole affair is still surrounded with mystery. It is known that he was\r\nan enthusiastic student of physical science, and that for years he had\r\nworking for him a Dutch mechanic, Caspar Kaltoff; it seems certain\r\nthat he actually made a water-pumping engine worked by steam, of whose\r\nvalue he was so impressed that he promised to leave the drawings of\r\nit to Gresham College and intended to have a model of it buried with\r\nhim.[72] But neither model nor drawings has ever yet been traced. And,\r\nconsidering the social influence of the inventor and the importance\r\nof the invention, the silence of his contemporaries on the discovery\r\nis strange and inexplicable. He received a patent for some form of\r\nwater-pumping engine. Distinguished visitors came to Vauxhall to see\r\nhis engine at work. He numbered among his acquaintances Sir Jonas\r\nMoore, Sir Samuel Morland, Flamstead and Evelyn: probably Mr. Pepys,\r\nSir W. Petty, and others of the group of eminent men of his time who\r\nwere interested in natural science. Yet no trace of his inventions has\r\ncome down to us. His _Century_ was admittedly compiled from memory--“my\r\nformer notes being lost”--and perhaps it was designedly obscure;\r\nscience was at that time a hobby of the cultured few, and scientific\r\nmen loved to mystify each other by the exhibition, without explanation,\r\nof paradoxes and toys of their own construction. The marquis, it will\r\nbe agreed, left valuable hints to later investigators. Whether his\r\nclaim to have invented the steam engine is sufficiently substantiated,\r\nwe leave to the opinion of the interested reader, who will find most\r\nof the evidence on this subject in Dirck’s _Life of the Marquis of\r\nWorcester_.\r\n\r\nThe power of steam to drive water from a lower to a higher level had\r\nbeen shown by Solomon de Caus,[73] who, in his work, _Les Raisons des\r\nForces Mouvantes_, published in A.D. 1615, had described a hot-water\r\nfountain operated by heating water in a globe. In Van Etten’s\r\n_Récreation Mathematique_ of 1629 was an experiment, described fifty\r\nyears later by Nathaniel Nye in his _Art of Gunnery_ as a “merry\r\nconceit,” showing how the force of steam could be used to discharge a\r\ncannon. As the century advanced the ornamental was gradually superseded\r\nby the utilitarian; the usefulness of steam for draining fens, pumping\r\nout mines, was realized; and applications for patents to cover the use\r\nof new and carefully guarded inventions began to appear.\r\n\r\nGunpowder as a medium was a strong competitor of steam. In 1661 King\r\nCharles granted to Sir Samuel Morland, his master of mechanics, “for\r\nthe space of fourteen years, to have the sole making and use of a new\r\ninvention of a certain engine lately found out and devised by him, for\r\nthe raising of water out of any mines, pits, or other places, to any\r\nreasonable height, and by the force of air and powder conjointly.”\r\nWhat form the engine took is not known; whether the gunpowder was\r\nused to produce a gaseous pressure by which the work was done, or\r\nwhether its function was to displace air and thus cause a vacuum as\r\nits gases cooled. In France, too, efforts were made at this time to\r\nproduce a gunpowder engine. In 1678 a Jean de Hautefeuille raised\r\nwater by gunpowder, but authorities differ as to whether he employed\r\na piston--which were then in use as applied to pumps--or whether he\r\nburned the powder so that the gases came in actual contact with the\r\nwater. In the following year an important advance was made. Huyghens\r\nconstructed an engine having a piston and cylinder, in which gunpowder\r\nwas used to form a vacuum, the atmospheric pressure providing the\r\npositive force to produce motion; and in 1680 he communicated to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences a paper entitled, “A new motive power by means of\r\ngunpowder and air.”\r\n\r\nBut it was to his brilliant pupil, Denis Papin, that we are indebted\r\nfor a further step in the materialization of the steam engine. Papin\r\nsuggested the use of steam for gunpowder.\r\n\r\nIn 1680 Papin, who like Solomon de Caus had brought his scientific\r\nconceptions to England in the hope of their furtherance, was admitted\r\non the recommendation of Boyle to a fellowship of the Royal Society.\r\nAfter a short absence he returned to London in ’84 and filled for a\r\ntime the post of curator to the society, meeting, doubtless, in that\r\ncapacity the leading scientists of the day and coming in touch with all\r\nthe practical efforts of English inventors. During his stay here he\r\nworked with enthusiasm at the production of a prime mover, and when he\r\nleft in ’87 for a mathematical professorship in Germany he continued\r\nthere his researches and experienced repeated failures. In a paper\r\npublished in ’88 he showed a clear conception of a reciprocating engine\r\nactuated by atmospheric pressure, and in ’90 he suggested for the first\r\ntime the use of steam for forming the vacuum required. As water, he\r\nwrote, has elasticity when fire has changed it into vapour, and as\r\ncold will condense it again, it should be possible to make engines\r\nin which, by the use of heat, water would provide the vacuum which\r\ngunpowder had failed to give. This memorable announcement gave a clear\r\ndirection to the future development of the heat engine. Steam was the\r\nmedium best suited for utilizing the expansive power of heat generated\r\nby the combustion of fuel; steam was the medium which, by its expansive\r\nand contractile properties, could be made to impart a movement _de va\r\net vient_ to a piston. Though Papin did not succeed in putting his idea\r\ninto practical form his conception was of great value, and he must be\r\ncounted as one of the principal contributors to the early development\r\nof the steam engine. His life was an accumulation of apparent failures\r\nending in abject poverty. To-day he is honoured by France as the\r\ninventor of the steam engine, and at Blois a statue has been erected\r\nand a street named to his memory.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the century an effective engine had been produced, in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn 1698 Thomas Savery, a Devonshire man, obtained a patent for “a new\r\ninvention for raising of water and occasioning motion to all sorts of\r\nmillwork by the impellent force of fire.” Before the king at Hampton\r\nCourt a model of this invention was displayed, and the importance of\r\nthe new discovery was soon realized by the landed classes; for in the\r\nfollowing year an act of parliament was passed for the encouragement\r\nof the inventor and for his protection in the development of what, it\r\nwas recognized, was likely to prove of great use to the public. In the\r\nsame year Savery published a pamphlet called _The Miner’s Friend_, and\r\nrepublished it, with additions, in 1702. This pamphlet contained a full\r\nand clear description of his engine; but significance has been attached\r\nto the omission from it of any claim that it embodied a new idea. The\r\nomission may be accidental.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine, shown in the accompanying illustration, was simply\r\na pump, whose cycle of operations was as follows. Steam, admitted\r\ninto the top of a closed vessel containing water and acting directly\r\nagainst the water, forced it through a pipe to a level higher than\r\nthe vessel itself. Then, the vessel being chilled and the steam in it\r\nthereby condensed, more water was sucked into the vessel from a lower\r\nlevel to fill the vacuum thus formed; this water was expelled by steam\r\nin the same way as before, cocks being manipulated, and, eventually,\r\nself-acting valves being placed, so as to prevent the water from\r\nreturning by the way it came. Two chambers were used, operating\r\nalternately.\r\n\r\nFor this achievement Savery is by many regarded as the first and\r\ntrue inventor. He certainly was the first to make the steam engine a\r\ncommercial success, and up and down the country it was extensively used\r\nfor pumping water and for draining mines. By others Savery was regarded\r\nas a copyist; and indeed it is difficult to say how far originality\r\nshould be assigned him. The marquis too had claimed to raise water; his\r\nengine had evidently acted with a pair of displacement-chambers, from\r\neach of which alternately water was forced by steam while the other\r\nvessel was filling. And if he did not specify or appreciate the effect\r\nof the contractile force of the steam when condensed, yet in this\r\nrespect both inventors had been anticipated by Giovanni della Porta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steam from Boiler.\r\n\r\nSAVERY’S ENGINE]\r\n\r\nThe marquis had a violent champion in Dr. Desaguliers, who in his\r\n_Experimental Philosophy_, published in 1743, imputed disreputable\r\nconduct to the later inventor. “Captain Savery,” said the doctor,\r\n“having read the Marquis of Worcester’s book, was the first who put\r\ninto practice the raising of water by fire. His engine will easily\r\nappear to have been taken from the Marquis of Worcester; though Captain\r\nSavery denied it, and the better to conceal the matter, bought all the\r\nMarquis of Worcester’s books that he could purchase in Pater-Noster\r\nRow and elsewhere, and burned them in the presence of the gentleman\r\nhis friend, who told me this. He said that he found out the power of\r\nsteam by chance, and invented the following story to persuade people to\r\nbelieve it, viz. that having drunk a flask of Florence at a tavern, and\r\nthrown the empty flask upon the fire, he called for a bason of water to\r\nwash his hands, and perceiving that the little wine left in the flask\r\nhad filled the flask with steam, he took the flask by the neck and\r\nplunged the mouth of it under the surface of the water in the bason,\r\nand the water in the bason was immediately driven up into the flask by\r\nthe pressure of the air. Now, he never made such an experiment then,\r\nnor designedly afterwards, which I shall thus prove,” etc. etc.\r\n\r\nOther writers saw no good reason for depriving the captain of the title\r\nof inventor. With reference to the book-burning allegation, the only\r\nevidence tending to substantiate it lay in the fact that the book “on\r\na sudden became very scarce, and but few copies of it were afterwards\r\nseen, and then only in the libraries of the curious.”[74] It has been\r\nremarked, also, that Desaguliers was himself to some extent a rival\r\nclaimant, several improvements, such as the substitution of jet for the\r\noriginal surface condensation being due to him; and that this fact gave\r\na palpable bias to his testimony on the work of others.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the claims of Savery have been upheld, as against\r\nthose of the marquis, by a writer who argued, not only that the engine\r\nof the marquis had never passed the experimental stage, but that no\r\ncounter-claim was made by his successors at the time Savery produced\r\nhis engine and obtained his patent. “Although a patent for ninety-nine\r\nyears (from 1663 to 1762) was granted the marquis, yet Captain Savery\r\nand his successors under his patents which extended for thirty-five\r\nyears (from 1698 to 1733) compelled every user of Newcomen’s and other\r\nsteam engines to submit to the most grinding terms and no one attempted\r\nto plead that Savery’s patents were invalidated by the Marquis of\r\nWorcester’s prior patents.”[75]\r\n\r\nBy the admirers of Papin it has been claimed that it was from him that\r\nSavery received his idea. “After having minutely compared Savery’s\r\nmachine,” says a biographer of Papin, “one arrives at the conviction\r\nthat _Savery discovered nothing_. He had borrowed from Solomon de Caus\r\nthe use of steam as a motive force, perfected by the addition of a\r\nsecond chamber; from Papin, the condensation of the steam.... And as\r\nfor the piston, borrowed ten years later by Newcomen, that was wholly\r\nPapin’s.”[76]\r\n\r\nSuppose it true; even so, his countrymen would always think great\r\ncredit attaches to Savery for his achievement.\r\n\r\nHis engine, though used extensively for lifting water through small\r\ndistances, was exceedingly wasteful of fuel, nor could it be used\r\nconveniently for pumping out mines or for other purposes in which a\r\nlarge lift was required. The lift or “head” was directly proportional\r\nto the steam pressure. Efforts to improve the lift by augmenting the\r\nsteam pressure resulted in endless accidents and discouragement; the\r\nsolder of the engine melted when steam of a higher pressure was used,\r\nthe joints blew open and the chambers burst.\r\n\r\nLiving at Dartmouth, within some fifteen miles of Savery’s home, were\r\ntwo men, Newcomen, an ironmonger, and Cawley, a glazier. These two had,\r\ndoubtless, every opportunity of seeing Savery’s engine at work. They\r\nappreciated its limitations and defects, and, undertaking the task of\r\nimproving it, they so transformed the steam engine that within a short\r\ntime their design had almost entirely superseded the more primitive\r\nform. Here, too, it might be said that they invented nothing. The merit\r\nof their new machine consisted in the achievement in practical form\r\nof ideas which hitherto had had scarcely more than an academic value.\r\nThe labours of others gave them valuable aid. Newcomen, it is certain,\r\ncould claim considerable knowledge of science, and though little is\r\nknown of his personality there is evidence that he had pursued for\r\nyears the object which he now achieved. He knew of the previous forms\r\nof piston engine which had been invented. He had probably read a\r\ntranslation, published in the _Philosophical Transactions_, of Papin’s\r\nproposal for an atmospheric engine with a vacuum produced by the\r\ncondensation of steam. He obtained from Savery the idea of a separate\r\nboiler, and other details. And where Papin had failed, Newcomen and\r\nhis partner succeeded. Their Atmospheric Steam Engine, as it was\r\naptly called, was produced in the year 1705, and at once proved its\r\nsuperiority over the old “Miner’s Friend.” It had assumed an entirely\r\nnew form. In a large-bore vertical cylinder a brass piston was fitted,\r\nwith a leather flap round its edge and a layer of water standing on\r\nit to form a seal against the passage of steam or air. The top of the\r\ncylinder was open to the atmosphere, the bottom was connected by a pipe\r\nwith a spherical boiler. The piston was suspended by a chain to one end\r\nof an overhanging timber beam, which was mounted on a brick structure\r\nso as to be capable of oscillating on a gudgeon or axis at its middle.\r\nOne end of this beam was vertically over the piston; at the other\r\nend was the bucket of a water-pump, also attached to a crosspiece or\r\n“horse-head,” by means of a chain or rod. The whole machine formed a\r\nhuge structure like a pair of scales, one of which (the water-pump) was\r\nloaded with weights so as to be slightly heavier than the other (the\r\nsteam engine).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWCOMEN’S ENGINE]\r\n\r\nTo work it, steam was generated in the boiler at a pressure slightly\r\ngreater than atmospheric. By the opening of a cock steam was admitted\r\nto the cylinder, below the piston, which was initially at rest in its\r\nhighest position. The steam having filled the cylinder and expelled\r\nnearly all the air, the cock was shut and the cylinder was chilled by\r\nan external spray of cold water. Whereupon, as soon as the steam in\r\nthe cylinder began to condense, the piston, forced down by the now\r\nunbalanced atmospheric pressure above it, began to descend. As soon as\r\nit had completed its downward stroke steam was again admitted beneath\r\nthe piston, and, the pressure on the two sides of the piston becoming\r\nequal, the piston began to move up again to its original position. And\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nThis was the original Newcomen engine. Even in this primitive form it\r\nfar surpassed Savery’s in economy of fuel and in safety. It had, too,\r\nfar greater flexibility in the manner in which its power could be\r\napplied; it could be used not only to lift a certain volume of water\r\nthrough a relatively small height, but a smaller volume through a\r\ngreater height: which was a desideratum in the case of deep mines like\r\nthose of Cornwall. In 1720 an engine was erected at Wheal Fortune mine\r\nhaving a cylinder nearly four feet in diameter and drawing water, at\r\nfifteen strokes a minute, from a depth of 180 feet.\r\n\r\nYet it was apparent that the engine was in many respects inefficient.\r\nThe cocks, for instance, which controlled the motion of the piston\r\nhad to be opened and shut by a man. Sometimes he let the piston rise\r\ntoo far, in fact, right out of the cylinder; sometimes he let it down\r\ntoo fast, so as to damage the engine. Again, the external spraying\r\nof the cylinder at every stroke to induce condensation of the steam\r\nwithin was an obviously clumsy and primitive operation. It was not long\r\nbefore external spraying gave place to internal cooling of the steam\r\nby the injection of water; this method being discovered, it is said,\r\nas the result of a leaky piston allowing its sealing water to pass,\r\nyet giving unaccountably good results. The difficulties with the cocks\r\nwere overcome by the laziness or initiative of a youth named Humphrey\r\nPotter, who attached some strings and catches to the cocks of an engine\r\nwhich he was employed to work at Wolverhampton.[77]\r\n\r\nWith these improvements the engine remained practically without\r\nalteration for the next forty years. Its greatest sphere of usefulness\r\nwas in the northern coalfields, where cheap and abundant fuel was close\r\nat hand. In Cornwall, until by special legislation the duty on seaborne\r\ncoal was remitted when used for Newcomen’s engine, the cost of fuel\r\nproved a great obstacle to its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn 1764 James Watt, an instrument maker employed on work for Glasgow\r\nCollege, was given the task of repairing a working model of a Newcomen\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nA man of serious and philosophical mind, an intimate friend of\r\nProfessor Robison, the physicist, and acquainted with the famous\r\nDr. Black of Edinburgh, then in the thick of his researches on\r\nthe phenomena of latent heat, Watt often discussed with these two\r\nscientists the possibility of improving the steam engine; which\r\napparatus was still only employed for the purpose of pumping water,\r\nand which was so clumsy and so wasteful of fuel as to be comparatively\r\nlittle used. To this end he was induced to try some experiments on\r\nthe production and condensation of steam. The results of these, and\r\na knowledge of the newly discovered phenomenon of latent heat,[78]\r\nconvinced him that the existing cycle of operations in the engine was\r\nfundamentally inefficient, and that improvement was to be sought in the\r\nengine itself rather than in the boiler, which was the element which\r\nwas receiving most attention from contemporary investigators.\r\n\r\nIn particular, he clearly discerned the thermal inefficiency of the\r\nNewcomen engine: the waste of heat involved in alternately heating\r\nand cooling the large metal cylinder, which absorbed such immense\r\nquantities of fuel. Watt’s first idea was, to lag the cylinder in wood\r\nso as to prevent all outward radiation. But the result of a trial of\r\na lagged cylinder was disappointing. A gain was certainly obtained\r\nin that the steam, when admitted to the cylinder, did not require to\r\nraise by partial condensation the temperature of the walls; it exerted\r\nits expansive force at once and the piston rose. But on the other hand\r\nmuch greater difficulty was experienced in condensing it when a vacuum\r\nwas required, for the down stroke. Moreover it was observed that an\r\nincrease in the amount of injection water only made matters worse.\r\n\r\nWatt was faced with a dilemma, and he overcame it by a series of\r\nstudies in the properties of steam which constitute, perhaps, the\r\nhighest achievement of this workman-philosopher.\r\n\r\nOut of all his experiments two conclusions were drawn by him; first,\r\nthat the lower the temperature of condensation of steam the more\r\nperfect the vacuum thereby formed; second, that the temperature of\r\nthe cylinder should be as nearly as possible equal to that of the\r\nsteam admitted to it. In Newcomen’s engine these two conditions\r\nwere obviously incompatible, and the problem was,--how could they\r\nbe reconciled? Early in 1765, while walking one Sunday afternoon in\r\nGlasgow Green the idea flashed upon him of condensing the steam in a\r\nseparate vessel. The steam was generated in a separate vessel, why not\r\nproduce the vacuum separately? With a view to trying this effect he\r\nplaced a hollow air-tight chest beneath the steam cylinder, connected\r\nwith it by a pipe having a stop-cock in it. This new or lower vessel\r\nwas immersed in a cistern of cold water. Upon trial being made, it\r\nwas found that by this simple contrivance as perfect a vacuum as\r\ndesired was produced; the speed of the engine was greatly increased,\r\nthe expenditure of fuel radically reduced, the walls of the steam\r\ncylinder were maintained at a high and constant temperature, and the\r\nwhole arrangement promised great success. The new vessel Watt called a\r\nCondenser.\r\n\r\nFresh difficulties now arose. As the engine worked, the condenser\r\ngradually filled with the condensed steam and had to be emptied\r\nperiodically. The water in which it was immersed became so hot, by\r\nabsorbing the heat of the steam, that it frequently required changing.\r\nWatt promptly called in aid two new auxiliaries, two organs whose\r\nmotion was derived from the main beam of the engine: the Air Pump\r\nand the Circulating Pump. By these expedients the action of the\r\ncondenser was rendered satisfactory, and an engine resulted which had a\r\nfuel-consumption less than half that of Newcomen’s engine.\r\n\r\nMuch, he saw, yet remained to be done to obtain economical expenditure\r\nof steam. In particular the open-topped cylinder, whose walls were\r\nchilled at every descent of the piston by contact with atmospheric air,\r\nwas an obvious source of inefficiency. He therefore determined not\r\nto expose the walls to the atmosphere at all, but to enclose all the\r\nspace above the piston; and, thinking thus, he conceived the idea of\r\nreplacing the air above the piston by steam, an equally powerful agent.\r\nThe cylinder he proposed to maintain at a constant high temperature by\r\nmeans of a layer of hot steam with which he encased it, which he called\r\na steam jacket. And so the atmospheric engine as left by Newcomen\r\nevolved into the _single-acting steam engine_ of Watt;--an engine in\r\nwhich steam was still used below the piston, only to displace air\r\nand provide a vacuized space for the downward motion of the piston;\r\nbut in which steam now acted positively above the piston, in lieu\r\nof atmospheric air, to drive it down. It was still a sufficiently\r\nprimitive form of prime mover. The piston was still lifted by the\r\ncounterweight at the other end of the timber cross-beam; the engine had\r\nnot yet developed the organs necessary for producing a satisfactory\r\nrotary motion. This step was shortly to follow.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 Watt obtained his patent for the “double impulse,” as it\r\nwas called; and by this step, by the transition from a single- to a\r\ndouble-acting engine, the possibilities of such machines for every\r\nvariety of application first came into general view. This stage of\r\nthe development showed to the full the ingenuity of Watt’s mechanical\r\nmind. By the invention of the slide-valve he distributed steam to\r\nthe top and to the bottom of the cylinder, and in appropriate phase\r\nwith these actions opened the two ends to the condenser; so that the\r\npiston was actuated positively and by an equal force on both up and\r\ndown strokes. The chain by which the piston had been suspended was no\r\nlonger adequate; it was replaced by a rod. A straight-line motion was\r\nrequired for the top end of the rod; so he formed a rack, to gear with\r\nthe circular end or horse-head of the beam. But this noisy mechanism\r\nwas soon superseded by another contrivance, the beautifully simple\r\n“parallel motion,” in which two circular motions are combined to\r\nproduce one which is rectilinear. This was patented in ’84.\r\n\r\nFour years before this, that ancient mechanism the crank and connecting\r\nrod had been applied, together with a flywheel, to transform the\r\nreciprocating motion of a steam engine into a rotary motion; and the\r\nnon-possession of this invention of James Pickard’s proved for a time a\r\nstumbling-block to Watt in his further development of his engine. Watt\r\nwould have nothing to do with it. By now he had joined his fortunes\r\nwith those of Mr. Boulton, of Soho, Birmingham, a man of great business\r\nability, in conjunction with whom he was engaged in constructing\r\nengines in large numbers to suit the varying conditions of the mines in\r\nCornwall and the North. Considerable ingenuity was expended by him in\r\ntrying to circumvent the troublesome crank of Pickard, and many devices\r\nwere produced, the most noteworthy being the “sun-and-planet wheels,”\r\nwhich enabled him with some sacrifice of simplicity to obtain the\r\nrotary motion desired.\r\n\r\nWatt seemed to be borne along by the momentum of his own discoveries;\r\nevery inquiry yielded him valuable reward. For some time he had studied\r\nthe possibility of reducing the violence with which the piston, now\r\npositively steam-driven on both sides, came to the end of its stroke.\r\nThis problem led him to the discovery of the advantage of using steam\r\nexpansively: of cutting off the inflow of steam before the piston had\r\ntravelled more than a fraction of its stroke, and letting its inherent\r\nelastic force impel it through the remainder of its journey, the\r\nsteam meanwhile expanding and thus exerting a continuously decreasing\r\nforce. Later came the throttle valve, and the centrifugal governor for\r\ncontrolling the speed of rotating engines; there was no end to his\r\ningenuity. And so complete was his inquiry into the possible sources\r\nof improvement of the steam engine, that he even considered means of\r\nregulating the force which the piston exerted on the crank throughout\r\nits working stroke, a force which was compounded of the steam pressure\r\nitself and of the mass-acceleration of the piston and other moving\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nAnother cardinal invention followed: the Indicator. The principle of\r\nthe indicator is now applied to every form and kind of piston engine.\r\nIt is a reproduction on a small scale of the essential part of the\r\nengine itself; a small piston, held by a spring and moving in a\r\ncylinder connected by a pipe with the cylinder of the engine itself,\r\nshows by the degree of compression imparted to the spring the gaseous\r\npressure actually present at any moment in the engine cylinder. By\r\nrecording the position of the indicator piston on a paper wrapped round\r\na rotating drum whose motion represents the motion of the engine’s\r\npiston, a diagram is obtained which by its area measures the work done\r\nby the steam during the stroke of the engine.\r\n\r\nThis instrument was designed by Watt to give his firm some standard\r\nof work which would serve as a basis for the power of each engine,\r\non which to charge their customers; their engines being sold by the\r\nhorse-power. But its usefulness far exceeded the immediate purpose\r\nfor which it was produced. Its diagram, to the eye of an expert,\r\ngave valuable information in respect of the setting of the valves,\r\nthe tightness of the piston, the dryness of the steam, the degree of\r\nvacuum in the condenser, and, generally, of the state of efficiency of\r\nthe engine. “It would be difficult to exaggerate the part which this\r\nlittle instrument has played in the evolution of the steam engine. The\r\neminently philosophic notion of an indicator diagram is fundamental\r\nin the theory of thermodynamics; the instrument itself is to the steam\r\nengineer what the stethoscope is to the physician, and more, for with\r\nit he not only diagnoses the ailments of a faulty machine, whether in\r\none or another of its organs, but gauges its power in health.”[79]\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the evolution of the steam engine up to the time\r\nwhen it was first adapted to the propulsion of war-vessels. There we\r\nmust leave it. In a later chapter we shall consider the evolution of\r\nthe propelling machinery in its relation, especially, to the military\r\nqualities of ships. A few observations will be sufficient to illustrate\r\nthe conditions, as to design, practice, and material, under which the\r\nsteam engine made its appearance in the royal navy.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Watt all improvement of steam machinery was\r\nstrenuously opposed by the combined force of prejudice and vested\r\ninterest. The great Watt himself had set his face against the use\r\nof high-pressure steam, and, such was the lingering force of his\r\nauthority, years passed before the general public gave assent to the\r\nadvances made by his talented successors--Hornblower, Woolf, Evans,\r\nand Trevithick. Before the end of the eighteenth century the first\r\nsteps had been made to use the force of steam for driving ships.\r\nBefore Trafalgar was fought steam engines had made their appearance\r\nin the royal dockyards. Then there was a pause; and many years passed\r\nby before steam propulsion was admitted to be a necessity for certain\r\nclasses of war-vessels.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of the state of design and practice as it\r\nexisted on ship-board in the year of Queen Victoria’s accession is\r\ngiven by Commander Robert Otway, R.N., in his treatise on _Steam\r\nNavigation_. Low-pressure principles are still in vogue; steam is\r\ngenerated still, at a pressure not exceeding three pounds per square\r\ninch, in rectangular boilers of various forms according to the fancy\r\nof the maker, scarcely two being alike. The engines are also of\r\nvarying forms, every size, variety, and power being deemed suitable\r\nfor similar vessels. They are amazingly ponderous: weigh about twelve\r\nhundredweight, and the boilers eight hundredweight, to the horsepower.\r\nThe engines of all makers exhibit the greatest variations in the\r\nrelative dimensions of their various parts: one firm embodies a massive\r\nframe and light moving rods and shafts, another adopts massive rods and\r\nshafts, and supports them within the lightest framework. The author\r\nadvocates a correct design and a “total dispensation of all superfluous\r\nornament.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONNECTING ROD\r\n\r\nFrom Otway]\r\n\r\nAlready, however, following the example of the Cornish mines, the\r\nbuilders of steam vessels were at this time beginning to adopt\r\nhigh-pressure steam, generated at a pressure of ten to fifteen pounds\r\nper square inch in cylindrical boilers, and working expansively--“doing\r\nwork in the cylinder by its elasticity alone”--before returning to\r\nthe jet condenser. This improvement, strenuously opposed by orthodox\r\nengineers as being unsafe for ship practice, was introduced first\r\ninto the Packet Establishment at Falmouth, and then, tardily, into\r\nGovernment steamers. It gave a gain in economy measured by the saving\r\nof “thousands of bushels of coal per month.” Steam engines working\r\non the low-pressure system used from nine to twelve pounds of coal\r\nper hour, for each horse-power. These engines were carried in vessels\r\n“built on the scantling of 10-ton brigs,” of great draught and of\r\nsuch small coal capacity--about 35 tons, on an average--that when\r\nproceeding out of home waters “they were burthened with, at the least,\r\nfour days’ more fuel, _on their decks_ (top hamper), in addition to\r\nthat which already filled up their coal-boxes below.” Boilers emitted\r\nblack clouds of smoke at sea. In harbour the paddle-wheels had to be\r\nturned daily, if but a few float-boards only, by the united force of\r\nthe crew. “Coaling ship” was carried out with the help of convicts from\r\nthe hulks:--“pampered delinquents,” observes the author, “whose very\r\nmovements are characteristic of their moral dispositions--being thieves\r\nof time; for their whole day’s duty is not worth an hour’s purchase.”\r\n\r\nIn these unattractive circumstances the steam engine, most wonderful\r\ncontrivance of the brain and hand of man, presented itself for\r\nembodiment in the navy, by the personnel of which it was regarded, not\r\nwithout reason, as an unmitigated evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n“NEW PRINCIPLES OF GUNNERY”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have traced the smooth-bore cannon through the successive stages\r\nof its evolution. It is now proposed to give, in the form of a\r\nbiographical sketch, an account of the inception of scientific methods\r\nas applied to its use, and at the same time to pay some tribute to the\r\nmemory of the man who laid the foundations deep and true of the science\r\nof modern gunnery. One man was destined to develop, almost unaided, the\r\nprinciples of gunnery as they are known to-day. This man was a young\r\nQuaker of the eighteenth century, Benjamin Robins.\r\n\r\nFor a variety of reasons his fame and services seem never to have been\r\nsufficiently recognized or acknowledged by his own countrymen. To many\r\nhis name is altogether unknown. To some it is associated solely with\r\nthe discovery of the ballistic pendulum: the ingenious instrument\r\nby which, until the advent of electrical apparatus, the velocities\r\nof bullets and cannon balls could be measured with a high degree of\r\naccuracy. But the ballistic pendulum was, as we shall see, only one\r\nmanifestation of his great originating power. The following notes will\r\nshow to what a high place Robins attained among contemporary thinkers;\r\nand demonstrate the extent to which, by happy combination of pure\r\nreason and experiment, he influenced the development of artillery\r\nand fire-arms. His _New Principles of Gunnery_ constituted a great\r\ndiscovery, simple and surprisingly complete. In this work he had not\r\nmerely to extend or improve upon the inventive work of others; his\r\nfirst task was to expose age-long absurdities and demolish all existing\r\ntheories; and only then could he replace them by true principles\r\nfounded on correct mathematical reasoning and confirmed by unwearying\r\nexperiment with a borrowed cannon or a “good Tower musquet.”\r\n\r\nDown to the time of Robins, gunnery was still held to be an art\r\nand a mystery. The gunner, that honest and godly man,[80] learned\r\nin arithmetic and astronomy, was master of a terrible craft;--his\r\nsaltpetre gathered, it was said, from within vaults, tombs, and other\r\ndesolate places;--his touchwood made from old toadstools dried over a\r\nsmoky fire;--himself working unscathed only by grace of St. Barbara,\r\nthe protectress of all artillerymen. The efficiency of his practice\r\ndepended overwhelmingly on his own knowledge and on the skill with\r\nwhich he mixed and adjusted his materials. No item in his system was of\r\nsealed pattern; every element varied between the widest limits. There\r\nwere no range-tables. His shots varied in size according to the time\r\nthey happened to have been in service, to the degree of rusting and\r\nflaking which they had suffered, and to their initial variations in\r\nmanufacture. His piece might be bored taper; if so, and if smaller at\r\nthe breech end than at the muzzle, there was a good chance of some shot\r\nbeing rammed short of the powder, leaving an air space, so that the\r\ngun might burst on discharge; if smaller at the muzzle end the initial\r\nwindage would be too great, perhaps, to allow of efficient discharge\r\nof any shot which could be entered. There was always danger to be\r\napprehended from cracks and flaws.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest of mysteries was that in which the flight of\r\nprojectiles was shrouded. At this point gunnery touched one of the\r\noldest and one of the main aspects of natural philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe Greek philosophers failed, we are told, in spite of their great\r\nmental subtlety, to arrive at any true conception of the laws governing\r\nthe motion of bodies. It was left to the period of the revival of\r\nlearning which followed the Middle Ages to produce ideas which were\r\nin partial conformity with the truth. Galileo and his contemporaries\r\nevolved the theory of the parabolic motion of falling bodies and\r\nconfirmed this brilliant discovery by experiment. Tartaglia sought\r\nto apply it to the motion of balls projected from cannon, but was\r\nheld up by the opposing facts: the initial part of the trajectory was\r\nseen to be a straight line in actual practice, and even, perhaps,\r\nto have an upward curvature. So new hypotheses were called in aid,\r\nand the path of projectiles was assumed to consist of three separate\r\nmotions: the _motus violentus_, the _motus mixtus_, and the _motus\r\nnaturalis_. During the _motus violentus_ the path of the spherical\r\nprojectile was assumed to be straight--and this fallacy, we may note in\r\npassing, gave rise to the erroneous term “point blank,” to designate\r\nthe distance to which the shot would travel before gravity began to\r\noperate; during the _motus naturalis_ the ball was assumed to fall\r\nalong a steep parabola; and during the _motus mixtus_, the path of the\r\ntrajectory near its summit, the motion was assumed to be a blend of\r\nthe other two. This theory, though entirely wrong, fitted in well with\r\npractical observation; the trajectory of a spherical shot was actually\r\nof this form described. But in many respects it had far-reaching\r\nand undesirable consequences. Not only did it give rise to the\r\nmisconception of the _point en blanc_; it tended to emphasize the value\r\nof heavy charges and high muzzle velocities while at the same time\r\nobscuring other important considerations affecting range.\r\n\r\nSo the gunner was primed with a false theory of the trajectory.\r\nBut even this could not be relied on as constant in operation. The\r\nranging of his shot was supposed to be affected by the nature of\r\nthe intervening ground; shot were thought to range short, for some\r\nmysterious reason, when fired over water or across valleys, and the\r\ngunner had to correct, as best he could, for the extra-gravitational\r\nattraction which water and valleys possessed. In addition to all these\r\nbewilderments there was the error produced by the fact that the gun\r\nitself was thicker at the breech than at the muzzle, so that the “line\r\nof metal” sight was not parallel with the bore: a discrepancy which\r\nto the lay mind, and not infrequently to the gunner himself, was a\r\nperpetual stumbling-block.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, in these conditions, the cannon remained a\r\nsingularly inefficient weapon. Imperfectly bored; discharging a ball of\r\niron or lead whose diameter was so much less than its own bore that the\r\nprojectile bounded along it and issued from the muzzle in a direction\r\noften wildly divergent from that in which the piece had been laid;\r\non land it attained its effects by virtue of the size of the target\r\nattacked, or by use of the _ricochet_; at sea it seldom flung its shot\r\nat a distant ship, except for the purpose of dismasting, but, aided by\r\ntactics, dealt its powerful blows at close quarters, double-shotted and\r\ncharged lavishly, with terrible effect. It was then that it was most\r\nefficient.\r\n\r\nNor is it surprising that, in an atmosphere of ignorance as to the true\r\nprinciples governing the combustion of gunpowder and the motion of\r\nprojectiles, false “systems” flourished. The records of actual firing\r\nresults were almost non-existent. Practitioners and mathematicians,\r\nsearching for the law which would give the true trajectories of cannon\r\nballs, found that the results of their own experience would not square\r\nwith any tried combination of mathematical curves. They either gave up\r\nthe search for a solution, or pretended a knowledge which they were\r\nunwilling to reveal.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn the year 1707 Robins was born at Bath. Studious and delicate in\r\nchildhood, he gave early proof of an unusual mathematical ability, and\r\nthe advice of influential friends who had seen a display of his talents\r\nsoon confirmed his careful parents in the choice of a profession for\r\nhim: the teaching of mathematics. Little, indeed, did the devout Quaker\r\ncouple dream, when the young Benjamin took coach for London with this\r\nobject in view, that their son was destined soon to be the first\r\nartillerist in Europe.\r\n\r\nThat the choice of a profession was a wise one soon became evident.\r\nHe was persuaded to study the great scientific writers of all\r\nages--Archimedes, Huyghens, Slusius, Sir James Gregory and Sir Isaac\r\nNewton; and these, says his biographer, he readily understood without\r\nany assistance. His advance was extraordinarily rapid. When only\r\nfifteen years old he aimed so high as to confute the redoubtable John\r\nBernouilli on the collision of bodies. His friends were already the\r\nleading mathematicians of the day, and there were many who took a\r\nstrong interest in the brilliant and attractive lad. He certainly was\r\ngifted with qualities making for success; for, we are told, “besides\r\nhis acquaintance with divers parts of learning, there was in him, to an\r\ningenuous aspect, joined an activity of temper, together with a great\r\nfacility in expressing his thoughts with clearness, brevity, strength,\r\nand elegance.”\r\n\r\nRobins’ mind was of too practical a bent, however, to allow him to stay\r\nfaithful to pure mathematics; his restless energy required another\r\noutlet. Hence he was led to consider those “mechanic arts” that\r\ndepended on mathematical principles: bridge building, the construction\r\nof mills, the draining of fens and the making of harbours. After a\r\nwhile, taking up the controversial pen again, he wrote and published\r\npapers by which a great reputation gradually accrued. In 1735 he\r\nblew to pieces, with a _Discourse on Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of\r\nFluxions_, a treatise written against the mathematicians by the\r\nBishop of Cloyne. And shortly after followed further abstruse and\r\ncontroversial studies: on M. Euler’s Treatise on Motion, on Dr. Smith’s\r\nSystem of Optics, and on Dr. Jurin’s Distinct and Indistinct Vision.\r\n\r\nHis command of language now attracted the attention of certain\r\ninfluential gentlemen who, deploring the waste of such talent on\r\nmathematical subjects, persuaded their young acquaintance to try his\r\nhand at the writing of political pamphlets: party politics being at\r\nthat time the absorbing occupation of the population of these islands.\r\nHis success was great; his writings were much admired. And--significant\r\nof the country and the age--friendships and acquaintances were formed\r\nby the pamphleteer which were later to be of great value to the rising\r\nscientist.\r\n\r\nThis phase of his activities, fortunately, did not last long. Kindling\r\nthe lamp of science once more, he now started on the quest which was to\r\nmake him famous.\r\n\r\nFor thoughtful men of all ages, as we have already noted, the flight\r\nof bodies through air had had an absorbing interest. The subject was\r\none of perennial disputation. The vagaries of projectiles, the laws\r\ngoverning the discharge of balls from cannon, could not fail to arouse\r\nthe curiosity of an enthusiast like Robins, and he now set himself\r\nin earnest to discover them by an examination of existing data, by\r\npure reason, and by actual experiment. Perusal of such books as had\r\nbeen written on the subject soon convinced him of the shallowness of\r\nexisting theories. Of the English authors scarcely any two agreed\r\nwith one another, and all of them carped at Tartaglia, the Italian\r\nscientist who in the classic book of the sixteenth century tried to\r\nuphold Galileo’s theory of parabolic motion as applied to military\r\nprojectiles. But what struck Robins most forcibly about all their\r\nwritings was the almost entire absence of trial and experiment by which\r\nto confirm their dogmatical assertions. This absence of any appeal to\r\nexperiment was certainly not confined to treatises on gunnery; it was\r\na conspicuous feature of most of the classical attempts to advance\r\nthe knowledge of physical science. Yet the flight of projectiles was\r\na problem which lent itself with ease to that inductive method of\r\ndiscovering its laws through a careful accumulation of facts. This work\r\nhad not been done. Of all the native writers upon gunnery only four\r\nhad ventured out of two dimensions; only four had troubled to measure\r\ndefinite ranges. All four asserted the general proposition that the\r\nmotion of bodies was parabolic. Only one noticed that practice did\r\nnot support this theory, and he, with misapplied ingenuity, called in\r\naid the traditional hypothesis of a violent, a crooked, and a natural\r\nmotion. Which wrong hypothesis enabled him, since he could choose for\r\nhimself the point at which the straight motion ceased, to square all\r\nhis results with his precious theory.\r\n\r\nLeaving the books of the practitioners, Robins had more to learn\r\nfrom the great circle of mathematicians who in the first part of\r\nthe eighteenth century lent a lustre to European science. The\r\nold hypotheses were fast being discarded by them. Newton, in his\r\n_Principia_, had investigated the laws of resistance of bodies to\r\nmotion through the air under gravity, by dropping balls from the\r\ncupola of St. Paul’s Cathedral; and he believed that the trajectory of\r\na cannon ball differed from the parabola by but a small extent. The\r\nproblem was at this time under general discussion on the Continent; and\r\nled to a collision between the English and the German mathematicians,\r\nNewton and Leibnitz being the two protagonists.[81] But, whatever the\r\nmerits or outcome of the controversy, one thing seems certain. None\r\nof the great men of the day understood the very great accession of\r\nresistance which a fast-travelling body encountered in cleaving the\r\nair, or realized the extent to which the trajectory was affected by\r\nthis opposing force. It was in fact universally believed and stated,\r\nthat “_in the case of large shot of metal, whose weight many times\r\nsurpasses that of air, and whose force is very great, the resistance\r\nof air is scarcely discernible, and as such may, in all computations\r\nconcerning the ranges of great and weighty bombs, be very safely\r\nneglected_.”[82]\r\n\r\nIn 1743 Robins’ _New Principles of Gunnery_ was read before the Royal\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nIn a short but comprehensive paper which dealt with both internal and\r\nexternal ballistics, with the operation of the propellant in the gun\r\nand with the subsequent flight of the projectile, the author enunciated\r\na series of propositions which, founded on known laws of physics and\r\nsustained by actual experiment, reduced to simple and calculable\r\nphenomena the mysteries and anomalies of the art of shooting with great\r\nguns. He showed the nature of the combustion of gunpowder, and how to\r\nmeasure the force of the elastic fluid derived from it. He showed, by a\r\ncurve drawn with the gun axis as a base, the variation of pressure in\r\nthe gun as the fluid expanded, and the work done on the ball thereby.\r\nProducing his ballistic pendulum he showed how, by firing a bullet of\r\nknown weight into a pendulum of known weight, the velocity of impact\r\ncould be directly ascertained. This was obviously a very important\r\ndiscovery. For an accurate measurement of the “muzzle velocity” of the\r\nbullet discharged from any given piece of ordnance was, and still is,\r\nthe solution and key to many another problem in connection with it:\r\nfor instance, the effect of such variable factors as the charge, the\r\nwindage or the length of gun. In fact, as the author claimed, there\r\nfollowed from the theory thus set out a whole host of deductions of\r\nthe greatest consequence to the world’s knowledge of gunnery. Then,\r\nfollowing the projected bullet in its flight, he proceeded to tell of\r\nthe continuous retardation to which it was subject owing to the air’s\r\nresistance. He found, he said, that this resistance was vastly greater\r\nthan had been anticipated. It certainly was not a negligible quantity.\r\nThe resistance of the air to a twenty-four pound cannon ball, fired\r\nwith its battering charge of sixteen pounds of powder, was no less\r\nthan twenty-four times the weight of the ball when it first issued\r\nfrom the piece: a force which sufficiently confuted the theory that\r\nthe trajectory was a parabola, as it would have been if the shot were\r\nfired in vacuo. It was neither a parabola, nor nearly a parabola. In\r\ntruth it was not a plane curve at all. For under the great force of\r\nthe air’s resistance, added to that of gravity, a ball (he explained)\r\nhas frequently a double curvature. Instead of travelling in one\r\nvertical plane it actually takes an incurvated line sometimes to right,\r\nsometimes to left, of the original plane of departure. And the cause of\r\nthis departure he ascribed to a whirling motion acquired by the ball\r\nabout an axis during its passage through the gun.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the paper provoked considerable discussion among the\r\nlearned Fellows, who found themselves presented with a series of the\r\nmost novel and unorthodox assertions, not in the form of speculations,\r\nbut as exact solutions to problems which had been hitherto unsolved;\r\nand these were presented in the clearest language and were fortified\r\nby experiments so careful and so consistent in their results as to\r\nleave small room for doubt as to the certainty of the author’s theory.\r\nOf special interest both to savants and artillerists must have been\r\nhis account of “a most extraordinary and astonishing increase in the\r\nresistance of the air which occurs when the velocity comes to be that\r\nof between eleven and twelve hundred feet in one second of time”: a\r\nvelocity, as he observed, which is equal to that at which sounds are\r\npropagated in air. He suggested that perhaps the air, not making its\r\nvibrations with sufficient speed to return immediately to the space\r\nleft in the rear of the ball, left a vacuum behind it which augmented\r\nthe resistance to its flight. His statement on the deflection of balls,\r\ntoo, excited much comment. And, in order to convince his friends of the\r\nreality of this phenomenon, which, though Sir Isaac Newton had himself\r\ntaken note of it in the case of tennis balls, had never been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated, Robins arranged an ocular demonstration.\r\n\r\nOne summer afternoon the experiments took place in a shady grove in\r\nthe Charterhouse garden. Screens--“of finest tissue paper”--were set\r\nup at intervals of fifty feet, and a common musket bored for an ounce\r\nball was firmly fixed in a vice so as to fire through the screens. By\r\nrepeated discharges the various deflections from the original plane of\r\ndeparture were clearly shown; some of the balls whirled to the right,\r\nsome to the left of the vertical plane in which the musket lay. But not\r\nonly was the fact of this deflection established to the satisfaction\r\nof the visitors. A simple but dramatic proof was afforded them of the\r\ncorrectness of Robins’ surmise that the cause was the whirling of the\r\nball in flight. A musket-barrel was bent so that its last three or\r\nfour inches pointed to the left of the original plane of flight. The\r\nball when fired would then be expected to be thrown to the left of\r\nthe original plane. But, said Robins, since in passing through the\r\nbent part the ball would be forced to roll upon the right-hand side\r\nof the barrel; and as thereby the left side of the ball would turn up\r\nagainst the air, and would increase the resistance on that side; then,\r\nnotwithstanding the bend of the piece to the left, the bullet itself\r\nmight incurvate towards the right. “And this, upon trial, did most\r\nremarkably happen.”[83]\r\n\r\nRobins by now had gained a European reputation. Mathematical\r\ncontroversy and experiments in gunnery continued to occupy his time\r\nand absorb his energies, and it was not long before he was again at\r\nthe rostrum of the Royal Society, uttering his eloquent prediction as\r\nto the future of rifled guns. Speaking with all the emphasis at his\r\ncommand he urged on his hearers the importance of applying rifling\r\nnot only to fire-arms but to heavy ordnance. That State, he said,\r\nwhich first comprehended the advantages of rifled pieces; which first\r\nfacilitated their construction and armed its armies with them; would\r\nby them acquire a superiority which would perhaps fall little short\r\nof the wonderful effects formerly produced by the first appearance of\r\nfire-arms. His words had little or no effect. Mechanical science was\r\nnot then equal to the task. A whole century was to elapse before rifled\r\nordnance came into general use. The genius of Whitworth was required to\r\nenable the workshops of the world to cope with its refined construction.\r\n\r\nAnother subject which attracted Robins’ attention at this time was\r\nfortification, the sister art of gunnery, which now had a vogue as a\r\nresult of the great continental wars. He was evidently regarded as an\r\nauthority on the subject, for we find him, in 1747, invited by the\r\nPrince of Orange to assist in the defence of Berghen-op-Zoom, then\r\ninvested and shortly afterwards taken by the French.\r\n\r\nNow befell an incident which, besides being a testimony to the\r\nversatility of his genius, proved to be of great consequence to him in\r\nhis study of artillery. In 1740 Mr. Anson (by this time Lord Anson,\r\nand at the head of the Admiralty) had set out on his famous voyage to\r\ncircumnavigate the world. For some time after his return the public\r\nhad looked forward to an authentic account, on the writing of which\r\nthe chaplain of the _Centurion_, Mr. Richard Walter, was known to be\r\nengaged. Mr. Walter had collected, in the form of a journal, a mass\r\nof material in connection with the incidents of the voyage. But on\r\na review of this it was decided that the whole should be rewritten\r\nin narrative form by a writer of repute. Robins was approached, and\r\naccepted the commission. The material of the chaplain’s journal was\r\nworked up by him into a narrative, and the book was published in 1748.\r\n“It was an immediate success; four large editions were sold in less\r\nthan a year; and it was translated, with its stirring accounts of\r\nperils and successes, into nearly all the languages in Europe.” Robins’\r\nname did not appear in it, and his share in the authorship is to this\r\nday a subject of literary discussion.\r\n\r\nThe acquaintance with Lord Anson thus formed was of great benefit to\r\nhim, not only in securing for him the means of varied experiment with\r\nall types of guns in use in the royal navy, but by the encouragement\r\nwhich his lordship gave him to publish his opinions even when they\r\nwere in conflict with the orthodox professional opinion of the day.\r\nTo this encouragement was due the publication in 1747 of a pamphlet\r\nentitled, _A Proposal for increasing the strength of the British\r\nNavy, by changing all guns from 18-pounders downwards into others of\r\nequal weight but of a greater bore_; a paper which, indirectly, had\r\nconsiderable influence on the development of sea ordnance. In the\r\nintroduction to this paper the author explains that its subject-matter\r\nis the result of the speculations and experiments of earlier years;\r\nand he describes the incident which at the later date induced its\r\npublication. It appears that at the capture of the _Mars_, man-of-war,\r\na manuscript was discovered on board which contained the results and\r\nconclusions of some important gunnery trials which the French had been\r\ncarrying out. This manuscript, being shown to Robins by Lord Anson,\r\nwas found to contain strong confirmation of his own views both as to\r\nthe best proportions of guns and the most efficient powder-charges\r\nfor the same. He had not published these before, he plaintively\r\nexplains, because, “not being regularly initiated into the profession\r\nof artillery, he would be considered a visionary speculatist.” But\r\nfortified by the French MS. he no longer hesitated to submit his\r\nproposal to the public.\r\n\r\nBriefly, the paper is an argument for a more efficient disposition\r\nof metal in ordnance. Robins states his case in language simple and\r\nconcise. Large shot, he says, have naturally great advantages in\r\nranging power over small shot; in sea fighting the size of the hole\r\nthey make and their increased power of penetration gives them a greatly\r\nenhanced value. Hence the endeavour made in all cases to arm a vessel\r\nwith the largest cannon she can with safety bear. And hence the\r\nnecessity for so disposing the weight of metal in a ship’s ordnance to\r\nthe best advantage; all metal not usefully employed in contributing to\r\nthe strength of the pieces being not only useless but prejudicial to\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to prove (not very convincingly, it must be admitted)\r\nthat there is a law of comparison to which the dimensions of all guns\r\nshould conform, and by which their weights could be calculated. For\r\nevery pound of bullet there should be allowed a certain weight of metal\r\nfor the gun. So, taking the service 32-pounder as having the correct\r\nproportions, the weight and size of every other piece can be found\r\nfrom this standard. He observes, however, that in actual practice the\r\nsmaller the gun, the greater its relative weight; the 6-pounder, for\r\nexample, weighs at least eighteen hundredweight, when by the rule it\r\nshould weigh ten. The proposal is therefore to utilize the redundant\r\nweight of metal by increasing the calibre of the smaller guns. At the\r\nsame time it is proposed to limit the stress imposed on all guns by\r\nreducing the powder-charge to one-third the weight of the bullet, for\r\nall calibres; this smaller charge being almost as efficient for ranging\r\nas the larger charges used, and infinitely less dangerous to the gun.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the pamphlet came at an opportune moment. A new\r\nspirit was dawning in the navy, a new enthusiasm and search for\r\nefficiency were abroad, which in the next half-century were to be\r\nrewarded by a succession of well-earned and decisive victories.\r\nInterest in the proposed change in armament was widespread, both in and\r\noutside the royal service. And a significant commentary on the proposed\r\nregulation of powder-charges was supplied, this very year, by Admiral\r\nHawke, who reported that in the fight off Ushant all the breechings\r\nof his lower-deck guns broke with the repeated violence of recoil,\r\nobliging him to shoot ahead of his opponent while new breechings were\r\nbeing seized.\r\n\r\nSome time was to elapse before the arguments of Robins gave signs of\r\nbearing fruit. Experiments carried out at Woolwich in the seventies\r\nby Dr. Hutton with all the facilities ensured by the patronage of a\r\nducal master-general of ordnance merely extended and confirmed Robins’\r\nown results. In ’79 the carronade made its appearance, to attest in\r\ndramatic fashion the value, at any rate for defensive work, of a large\r\nball, a small charge, and an unusually small windage. As offensive\r\narmament it represented, of course, the _reductio ad absurdum_ of the\r\nprinciples enunciated by Robins; its dominant feature of a ball of\r\nmaximum volume projected with a minimum velocity was, in the words of\r\nan American authority, “manifestly as great an error as the minima\r\nmasses and the maxima velocities of the long gun system, to which the\r\ncarronade was thus directly opposed.” Nevertheless, the carronade\r\n(whose history we deal with in a later chapter) did excellent work.\r\nMounted upon the upper decks and forecastles of merchantmen and the\r\nsmaller classes of warships, it emphasized, by the powerful and often\r\nunexpected blows which it planted in the ribs of such adversaries\r\nas ventured within its range, the comparative inefficiency of the\r\nsmaller types of long gun with which our ships of war were armed.\r\nTo the clearest-sighted of our naval captains the relative merits\r\nand defects of the carronade and the small long gun were evidently\r\nclear. In the year 1780 we find Kempenfelt advocating, in a letter\r\nto Sir Charles Middleton, a weapon with a little more length and\r\nweight than a carronade: something between it and a long gun. Robins’\r\narguments against the still prevalent types of small pieces have proved\r\nconvincing to him, and he transcribes the whole of the _Proposal_ for\r\nthe consideration of his superior. “Here you have, sir,” he writes,\r\n“the opinion of the ablest artillery officer in England at that time,\r\nand perhaps in Europe.”\r\n\r\nOnce more the versatile and gifted pen was called in aid of politics.\r\nIn 1749 he was persuaded to write what his biographer describes as a\r\nmasterpiece of its kind: _An apology for the unfortunate affair at\r\nPreston-Pans in Scotland_.[84] But soon an opening worthier of his\r\ntalents presented itself. The East India Company, whose forts in India\r\nwere as yet ill-adapted for defence, required the services of an expert\r\nin military fortification. An offer was made, and, as Engineer-General\r\nto the Company, Robins left England for the East at the end of ’49,\r\nto the great sorrow of all his acquaintance. They were not to see him\r\nagain. In the summer of the following year he died of a fever, pen in\r\nhand, at work upon his plans in the service of the Company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo ended a short, a brilliant, and a very honourable career. Benjamin\r\nRobins possessed in an exceptional degree the power, inherent in so\r\nmany of his countrymen, of applying the truths of science to practical\r\nends. An individualist deriving inspiration from the great masters of\r\nthe past, he followed the bent of his enthusiasms in whatever direction\r\nit might lead him, till ultimately his talents found expression in a\r\nfield undreamed of by himself or by his early friends. In the realm of\r\ngunnery he was an amateur of genius. Partly for that reason, perhaps,\r\nhis views do not appear to have been considered as authoritative by\r\nour own professionals; the prophet had more honour in Berlin, Paris\r\nand Washington. Speaking of the rifle, the true principle of which was\r\nadmittedly established by him, the American artillerist Dahlgren wrote\r\nin 1856: “The surprizing neglect which seemed to attend his labours was\r\nin nothing more conspicuous than in the history of this weapon. Now\r\nthat whole armies are to wield the rifled musket with its conical shot,\r\none is surprized at the time which was permitted to elapse since that\r\nable experimenter so memorably expressed his convictions before the\r\nRoyal Society, in 1746.”\r\n\r\nOf the value of his work to the nation there is now no doubt. Of\r\nthe man himself an entertaining picture is given in his biography,\r\npublished, together with his principal papers, by Dr. Hutton, from\r\nwhich many of the foregoing notes have been taken. Among other eminent\r\nmen who have given their life and labours to the public service, and\r\nwhose efforts in building up the past greatness of England have been\r\ngenerously acknowledged, let us not forget to honour that distinguished\r\ncivilian, Benjamin Robins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TUDOR SHIPS UNDER SAIL\r\n\r\nFrom the same MS. as plate facing page 60]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CARRONADE\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the monthly meeting of the Carron Company, a Scotch iron-founding\r\nand shipping firm, which was held in December, 1778, the manager\r\ninformed the board that, in order to provide armament for some of the\r\nCompany’s sailing packets, he had constructed a very light species\r\nof gun, resembling a cohorn, which was much approved by many people\r\nwho had come on purpose to inspect it. So favourable, indeed, was\r\nthe impression given by the inspection of this weapon that, with the\r\ncompany’s permission, he could receive a great many orders for them.\r\nWhereon it was resolved to authorize the manufacture of the new species\r\nin quantity; and to call all such guns as should be made by them of\r\nthis nature, Carronades.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances in which the carronade first came into\r\nuse. And the following advertisement, appearing in Edinburgh shortly\r\nafterwards, sufficiently explains the incentive for exploiting the new\r\ntype of ordnance, and the reason of its popularity among shipowners,\r\npassengers and crews. “To sail March 5, 1779, the _Glasgow_,\r\nRobert Paterson master, mounting fourteen twelve-pounders, and men\r\nanswerable.... N.B.--The Carron vessels are fitted out in the most\r\ncomplete manner for defence at a very considerable expense, and are\r\nwell provided with small arms. All mariners, recruiting parties,\r\nsoldiers upon furlow, and all other steerage passengers who have been\r\naccustomed to the use of fire-arms, and who will engage in defending\r\nthemselves, will be accommodated with their passage to and from London,\r\nupon satisfying the masters for their provisions, which in no instance\r\nshall exceed 10s. 6d. sterling. The Carron vessels sail regularly as\r\nusual, without waiting for the convoy.”\r\n\r\nThe carronade was a very short, light, carriage gun of relatively\r\nlarge bore, made to take a standard size of long-gun shot and project\r\nit, by means of a small charge of powder, against an enemy at close\r\nrange. Its proprietors soon found a market for the produce of their\r\nfoundry, not only for merchant ships but for men-of-war. The reputation\r\nof the new ordnance quickly spread; carronades found a place almost\r\nimmediately among the orthodox armament of the greater number of our\r\nfighting ships; and kept their place till, after a chequered career of\r\nhalf a century, during which they contributed both to victory and to\r\ndefeat, they were finally discarded from the sea service.\r\n\r\nThe story of the carronade begins some little time before the meeting\r\nof the Carron board in the year 1778. It will be remembered that in\r\n1747 Mr. Benjamin Robins had advocated, in a much-talked-of paper,\r\nan increase in the calibre of warships’ guns at the expense of their\r\nranging power, and that in support of his argument he had drawn\r\nattention to two features of ship actions--first, that the great\r\nmajority of duels were fought at close quarters; secondly, that the\r\ndestructive effect of a cannon-ball against an enemy’s hull depended\r\nlargely on the external dimensions of the ball, the larger of two balls\r\nproducing an effect altogether out of proportion to the mere difference\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nHowever invalid may have been the arguments founded on these\r\nassertions--and that there was a serious flaw in them time was to\r\nshow--there could be no doubt that, so far as considerations of defence\r\nwere concerned, the conclusions reached were of important value. In\r\nthe case of a merchant packet defending herself from boarding by a\r\nprivateer, for example, a light, short-ranging gun throwing a large\r\nball would give far more effective protection than a small-calibre\r\nlong gun. And if, moreover, the former involved a dead weight less\r\nthan a quarter, and a personnel less than half, of that involved\r\nby the latter, the consideration of its superiority in action was\r\nstrongly reinforced, in the opinion of shipowners and masters, by\r\nless advertised considerations of weight, space, and equipment--very\r\nimportant in their relation to the speed and convenience of the vessel,\r\nand hence to all concerned.\r\n\r\nSo the arguments of Robins, though propounded solely with reference to\r\nwarships, yet applied with special force to the defensive armament of\r\nmerchant ships. A conception of this fact led a very able artillerist,\r\nGeneral Robert Melville, to propose, in 1774, a short eight-inch gun\r\nweighing only thirty-one hundredweight yet firing a nicely fitting\r\nsixty-eight pound ball with a charge of only five and a half pounds of\r\npowder. This piece he induced the Carron company to cast, appropriately\r\nnaming it a Smasher. Of all the carronades the Smasher was the\r\nprototype. It possessed the special attributes of the carronades in the\r\nsuperlative degree; the carronade was a reproduction, to a convenient\r\nscale, of the Smasher. That General Melville was the prime inventor\r\nof the new type, has been placed beyond doubt by the inscription on\r\na model subsequently presented to him by the Carron Company. The\r\ninscription runs: “Gift of the Carron Company to Lieut.-General\r\nMelville, inventor of the Smashers and lesser carronades for solid,\r\nship, shell, and carcass shot, etc. First used against French ships in\r\n1779.”[85]\r\n\r\nIn almost every respect the Smasher was the antithesis of the long\r\ngun: the advantages of the one were founded on the shortcomings of\r\nthe other. For instance, the smallness of the long gun’s ball was a\r\nfeature which, as ships’ sides came to be made stronger and thicker,\r\nrendered the smaller calibres of long guns of a diminishing value as\r\noffensive armament. It was becoming increasingly difficult to sink a\r\nship by gunfire. The round hole made near the enemy’s water-line was\r\ninsufficient in size to have a decisive effect; the fibres of the\r\ntimber closed round the entering shot and, swelled by sea-water, half\r\nclosed the hole, leaving the carpenter an easy task to plug the inboard\r\nend of it. The large and irregular hole made by a Smasher, on the other\r\nhand, the ragged and splintered opening caused by the crashing of the\r\nlarge ball against the frames and timbers, was quite likely to be the\r\ncause of a foundering. Again, the high velocity of the long gun’s ball,\r\nwhile giving it range and considerable penetrative power, was actually\r\na disadvantage when at close quarters with an enemy. The maximum effect\r\nwas gained, as every gunner knew, when the ball had just sufficient\r\nmomentum to enable it to penetrate an opponent’s timbers. The result of\r\na high velocity was often to make a clean hole through a ship without\r\nmaking a splinter or causing her to heel at all. Hence the practice of\r\ndouble-shotting: a system of two units which, as we have just seen,\r\nwas less likely to prove effective than a system of a larger single\r\nunit. On the other hand the Smasher vaunted its low muzzle velocity. As\r\nfor the relative powder charges, that of the long gun was wastefully\r\nlarge and inefficient, while that of the Smasher was small and very\r\neffective. It was in this respect, perhaps, that the Smasher showed\r\nitself to the greatest advantage. And as this feature exerted from\r\nthe first an important influence on all other types of ordnance, we\r\nwill examine in some detail the means by which its high efficiency was\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nApart from the inefficiency inherent in the small-ball-and-big-velocity\r\nsystem the long gun laboured under mechanical disadvantages from which\r\nits squat competitor was happily free. In the eighteenth century the\r\nstate of workshop practice was so primitive as to render impossible any\r\nfine measurements of material. Until the time of Whitworth the true\r\nplane surface, the true cylinder and the true sphere were unattainable\r\nin practice. For this reason a considerable clearance had to be\r\nprovided between round shot and the bores of the guns for which they\r\nwere intended; in other words, the inaccuracies which existed in the\r\ndimensions of guns and shots necessitated the provision of a certain\r\n“windage.” But other considerations had also to be taken into account.\r\nThe varying temperatures at which shot might require to be used; the\r\nfouling of gun-bores by burnt powder; the effect of wear and rust on\r\nboth shot and bore, and especially the effect of rust on the shot\r\ncarried in ships of war (at first enlarged by the rust and then, the\r\nrust flaking or being beaten off with hammers, reduced in size)--all\r\nthese factors combined to exact such disproportionate windage that, in\r\nthe best conditions, from one-quarter to one-third of the force of the\r\npowder was altogether lost, while, in the worst conditions, as much as\r\none-half of the propulsive force of the powder escaped unused. Not only\r\nwas a large charge required, therefore, but the range and aim of the\r\nloosely fitting shot was often incorrect and incalculable; the motion\r\nof the shot was detrimental to the surface of the bore and the life of\r\nthe gun; while the recoil was so boisterous as sometimes to dismount\r\nand disable the gun, injure the crew, and even endanger the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the Smasher, by eliminating this obvious deficiency of\r\nthe long gun, gave to his weapon not only a direct advantage due to the\r\nhigher efficiency of the powder-charge, but also several collateral\r\nadvantages arising from it, such as, economy of powder, ease of recoil,\r\nand small stresses upon the mounting and its supporting structure.\r\n\r\nIt had been laid down by Dr. Hutton in 1775, as one of the chief\r\nresults of the systematic experiments carried out by him at Woolwich\r\nin extension of the inquiries originated by Robins, that if only the\r\nwindage of guns could be reduced very important advantages would\r\naccrue; among others, a saving of at least one-third of the standard\r\ncharges of powder would result. General Melville determined to give the\r\nSmasher the very minimum of windage necessary to prevent accident. The\r\nshortness of the bore favoured such a reduction. The large diameter,\r\nthough at first it might appear to render necessary a correspondingly\r\nlarge windage, was actually an advantage from this point of view.\r\nFor, instead of adhering to the orthodox practice with long guns, of\r\nmaking the windage roughly proportional to the diameter of the bore, he\r\ngave the Smasher a windage less than that of a much smaller long gun,\r\narguing that though a certain mechanical clearance was necessary, yet\r\nthe amount of this clearance was in no way dependent on the diameter\r\nof the shot or piece. The large size of the Smasher acted therefore to\r\nits advantage. The windage space through which the powder gases could\r\nescape was very small in relation to the area of the large ball on\r\nwhich they did useful work.\r\n\r\nBut this divergence from the standard practice would appear to\r\nnecessitate the provision of special ammunition for use with the\r\nSmasher: the nicely fitting sixty-eight pound ball would require to\r\nbe specially made for it? And this would surely militate against\r\nthe general adoption of the Smasher in the public service? No such\r\ndifficulty confronted the inventor. For, curiously enough, the\r\nprinciple on which the dimensions of gun-bores and shot were fixed\r\nwas the reverse of the principle which obtains to-day. Instead of the\r\ndiameter of the _gun_ being of the nominal dimension and the diameter\r\nof the shot being equal to that of the gun minus the windage, the\r\ndiameter of the _shot_ was the datum from which the amount of the\r\nwindage and the calibre of the gun were determined.\r\n\r\nSo, the size of the shot being fixed, a reduction of windage was\r\nobtainable in a new design of gun by boring it to a smaller than the\r\nstandard diameter. And this was what the inventor of the Smasher\r\ndid. The large ball, in combination with the restricted windage and\r\nthe small charge of powder, gave the Smasher ballistic results far\r\nsuperior, relatively, to those obtained with the long gun. Its lack of\r\nranging power was admitted. But for close action it was claimed that it\r\nwould prove an invaluable weapon, especially in the defence of merchant\r\nships.[86] Not only would its large ball make such holes in the light\r\nhull of an enemy privateer as would break through his beams and frames\r\nand perhaps send all hands to the pumps; but, projected with just\r\nsufficient velocity to carry it through an opponent’s timbers, it would\r\nthereby produce a maximum of splintering effect and put out of action\r\nguns, their crews, and perhaps the vessel itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nOn the lines of the Smasher the “lesser carronades,” more convenient in\r\nsize and more easily worked, were cast, and quickly made a reputation\r\nin merchant shipping. The Smasher itself was offered to the admiralty,\r\nbut was never fitted in a royal ship; though trials were carried\r\nout with it later with hollow or cored shot, to ascertain how these\r\nlighter balls compared in action with the solid 68-pounders. Meanwhile\r\nthe Carron Company found a large market for the lighter patterns of\r\ncarronade; the 24, 18, and 12-pounders were sold in large numbers to\r\nprivate ships and letters-of-marque, and to some of the frigates and\r\nsmaller ships of the royal navy. The progress of the new ordnance was\r\nwatched with interest by the board of admiralty. In 1779 we have Sir\r\nCharles Douglas writing to Sir Charles Middleton in full accord with\r\nhis views on the desirability of mounting Carron 12-pounders on the\r\npoop of the _Duke_, and suggesting 24-pounders, three a side, upon\r\nher quarter-deck. To the same distinguished correspondent Captain\r\nKempenfelt writes, deploring that no trials have yet been made with\r\ncarronades. Shortly afterwards the navy board discusses the 68-pound\r\nSmasher and desires the master-general of ordnance to make experiment\r\nwith it. A scale is drawn up by the navy board, moreover, and\r\nsanctioned by the admiralty, for arming different rates with 18-and\r\n12-pounder carronades. The larger classes of ships, the first, second,\r\nand third rates, have their quarter-decks already filled with guns; but\r\naccommodation is found for a couple of carronades on the forecastles,\r\nand for half a dozen on the poop, which for nearly a century past has\r\nserved chiefly as a roof for the captain’s cabin. This is now timbered\r\nup and given three pairs of ports, making a total of eight ports\r\nfor the reception of carronades. In the case of smaller ships less\r\ndifficulty is experienced. Ports are readily cut in their forecastles\r\nand quarter-decks, and in some cases their poops are barricaded, to\r\ngive accommodation for from four to a dozen carronades.[87]\r\n\r\nThe new weapon found its way into most of our smaller ships, not always\r\nand solely as an addition to the existing long-gun armament, for use\r\nin special circumstances, but in many cases in lieu of the long guns\r\nof the establishment. The saving in weight and space gained by this\r\nsubstitution made the carronade especially popular in the smaller\r\nclasses of frigate, the sloops, and brigs; many of which became almost\r\nentirely armed with the type. The weak feature of the carronade, which\r\nin the end was to prove fatal to it--its feeble range and penetrating\r\npower--was generally overlooked, or accepted as being more than\r\ncompensated for by its many obvious advantages. The carronade, it was\r\nsaid by many, was the weapon specially suited to the favourite tactics\r\nof the British navy--a yard-arm action.\r\n\r\nThere were others, however, who were inclined to emphasize the\r\ndisability under which the carronade would lie if the enemy could\r\ncontrive to avoid closing and keep just out of range. And on this\r\ntopic, the relative merits of long gun and carronade as armament\r\nfor the smaller ships, discussion among naval men was frequent and\r\nemphatic. The king’s service was divided into two schools. The\r\nadvocates of long guns could quote many a case where, especially in\r\nchase, the superior range of the long gun had helped to win the day.\r\nThe advocates of the carronade replied with recent and conclusive\r\nexamples of victories won by short-gun ships which had been able to\r\nget to grips and quickly neutralize the advantages of a superior enemy\r\narmed with long guns. When challenged with the argument that, since\r\nthe advantages of the carronade entirely disappear at long ranges it\r\nis essential that ships armed with them should be exceptionally fast\r\nsailers, they replied, that the very lightness of a carronade armament\r\nwould, other things being equal, give ships so armed the property\r\nrequired. As for out-ranging, they were even ready to back their\r\ncarronades in that respect, if only they were well charged with powder.\r\nIt was a matter of faith with many that, in spite of Dr. Hutton’s\r\npublished proof to the contrary, a considerable increase of range could\r\nbe obtained by the expedient of shortening the gun’s recoil; so that in\r\nchase it was a common procedure to lash the breechings of carronades to\r\nthe ship’s timbers, to prevent recoil and to help the shot upon its way.\r\n\r\nAt first mechanical difficulties occurred in the fitting of the new\r\ncarronade mountings which, though not due to any defect inherent in\r\nthe equipments, nevertheless placed them under suspicion in certain\r\nquarters. Though the prototype had trunnions like a gun, the carronades\r\nafterwards cast were attached by lugs to wooden slides which recoiled\r\non slotted carriages pivoted to the ship’s side timbers, the slide\r\nbeing secured to the carriage by a vertical bolt which passed down\r\nthrough the slot. The recoil was limited by breechings; but as these\r\nstretched continuously the bolt eventually brought up with a blow\r\nagainst the end of the slot in the carriage: the bolt broke, and\r\nthe carronade was disabled. This happened at Praya Bay, where the\r\ncarronades broke their beds, owing to slack breechings, after a few\r\nrounds. Captains complained, too, that the fire of the carronades was a\r\ndanger to the shrouds and rigging.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CARRONADE]\r\n\r\nIn spite of these views the popularity of the new ordnance increased so\r\nrapidly that in January, 1781, there were, according to the historian\r\nJames, 429 ships in the royal navy which mounted carronades. On the\r\nmerits of these weapons opinion was still very much divided. The board\r\nof ordnance was against their adoption; the navy board gave them a mild\r\napproval. In practice considerable discretion appears to have been\r\ngranted to the commanders of ships in deciding what armament they\r\nshould actually carry.[88] But the uncertainty of official opinion\r\ngave rise to a surprising anomaly: _the carronade, although officially\r\ncountenanced, was not recognized as part of the orthodox armament of a\r\nship_. What was the cause of this is not now clear. It has been said\r\nin explanation, that the carronade formed too fluctuating a basis on\r\nwhich to rate a ship’s force; that a long-gun basis afforded a key to\r\nthe stores and complement of a ship, whereas carronades had little\r\neffect on either complement or stores; or that it may have been merely\r\ninertia on the part of the navy board. Whatever the cause, the ignoring\r\nof the carronade, in all official quotations of ships’ armaments, led\r\nto great uncertainty and confusion in estimating the relative force of\r\nour own and other navies, to suggestions of deception on the part of\r\nantagonists, to the bickering of historians and the bewilderment of the\r\nrespective peoples. This extraordinary circumstance, that carronades\r\nwith all their alleged advantages were not thought worthy to be ranked\r\namong the long guns of a ship, is commented on at length by James.\r\n“Whether,” he says, “they equalled in calibre the heaviest of these\r\nguns, added to their number a full third, or to their power a full\r\nhalf, still they remained as mere a blank in the ship’s nominal, or\r\nrated force, as the muskets in the arm-chest. On the other hand, the\r\naddition of a single pair of guns of the old construction, to a ship’s\r\narmament, removed her at once to a higher class and gave her, how novel\r\nor inconvenient soever, a new denomination.”\r\n\r\nWhile the products of the Carron firm were gaining unexpected success\r\nin the defence of merchant shipping, their value in ships of the line\r\nwas not to remain long in doubt. Some of the heavier carronades had\r\nbeen mounted in the _Formidable_, _Duke_, and other ships, and their\r\npresence had a material effect in Admiral Rodney’s action of April,\r\n1782. As had been generally recognized, the carronade was especially\r\nsuited to the British aims and methods of attack--the destruction of\r\nthe enemy by a yard-arm action. To the French, whose strategy and\r\nmethods were fundamentally different, its value was less apparent. So\r\nthat for long this country reaped alone the benefit of its invention;\r\nuntil in somewhat half-hearted way France gradually adopted it, and\r\nthen mostly in the smaller sizes, and more apparently with a view to\r\ndefence than for offensive purposes. In the action with de Grasse the\r\ncarronades of the British fleet operated, in the opening stages, as an\r\nadditional incentive to the enemy to avoid close quarters. And later,\r\nat the in-fighting, their weight of metal contributed in no small\r\ndegree to the superiority of fire which finally forced him to surrender.\r\n\r\nIt was later in this same year that the carronade won its most dramatic\r\nvictory as armament of a small ship. In order to give a thorough trial\r\nto the system the navy board had ordered the _Rainbow_, an old 44, to\r\nbe experimentally armed with large carronades, some of which were of\r\nas large a calibre as the original Smasher; by which her broadside\r\nweight of metal was almost quadrupled. Thus armed she put to sea and\r\none day fell in with the French frigate _Hébé_, armed with 18-pounder\r\nlong guns. Luring her enemy to a close-quarter combat, the _Rainbow_\r\nsuddenly poured into the Frenchman the whole weight of her broadside.\r\nThe resistance was short, the _Hébé_ surrendered, and proved to be a\r\nprize of exceptional value as a model for frigate design. The capture\r\nwas quoted as convincing proof of the value of a carronade armament,\r\nand the type continued from this time to grow in popularity, until the\r\ntermination of the war in 1783 put a stop to further experiments with\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThroughout the long war which broke out ten years later the carronade\r\nplayed a considerable part in the succession of duels and actions which\r\nhad their climax off Trafalgar. It was now generally adopted as a\r\nsecondary form of armament, captains being permitted, upon application,\r\nto vary at discretion the proportion of long-gun to carronade armament\r\nwhich they wished to carry. In the smaller classes especially, a\r\npreponderance of carronades was frequently accepted; the accession\r\nof force caused by the substitution of small carronades for 6-and\r\n9-pounder long guns in brigs and sloops could hardly be disputed. In\r\nships-of-the-line the larger sizes continued in favour. The French now\r\nbenefited, too, by their adoption; on more than one occasion their\r\npoop and forecastle carronades, loaded with langrage, played havoc\r\nwith our personnel. Spaniards and Dutchmen did not carry them. How far\r\ntheir absence contributed to their defeats it is not now to inquire;\r\nbut how the tide of battle would have been affected by them--if the\r\nDutch fleet, for instance, had carried them at Camperdown--may be a not\r\nunprofitable speculation.\r\n\r\nEarly in the war the carronade system was to score its greatest\r\ndefensive triumph, and this, by a happy coincidence, in the hands of\r\nthe old _Rainbow’s_ commander.\r\n\r\nThe _Glatton_, one of a few East Indiamen which had been bought by the\r\nadmiralty, was fitted out in 1795 as a ship of war, and left Sheerness\r\nin the summer of the following year under the command of Captain Henry\r\nTrollope to join a squadron in the North Sea. At her commander’s\r\nrequest she was armed with carronades exclusively. She was without\r\nahead or astern fire, without a single long bow or stern chaser; she\r\ncarried 68-pounder carronades along her sides, whose muzzles were so\r\nlarge that they almost filled the small port-holes of the converted\r\nIndiaman and prevented more than a small traverse. Off the Flanders\r\ncoast she fell in one night with six French frigates, a brig-corvette,\r\nand a cutter; and at ten o’clock a close action began. The _Glatton_\r\nwas engaged by her antagonists on both sides, her yard-arms almost\r\ntouching those of the enemy. She proved to be a very dangerous foe.\r\nHer carronades, skilfully pointed and served by supply parties who\r\nworked port and starboard pieces alternately, poured out their heavy\r\nmissiles at point-blank range. So heavy was her fire that one by one\r\nthe frigates had to haul off, severely damaged, and the _Glatton_ was\r\nleft at last to spend the night repairing her rigging unmolested, but\r\nin the expectation that the French commodore would renew the attack in\r\nthe morning. To her surprise no action was offered. The blows of the\r\n68-pounders had done their work. Followed by the _Glatton_ with a “brag\r\ncountenance,” the enemy retired with his squadron in the direction of\r\nFlushing.\r\n\r\nThe action had more than one lesson to teach, however, and no more\r\nships, except small craft, were armed after this upon the model of the\r\n_Glatton_.\r\n\r\nWe must at this point mention an experiment made in the year 1796,\r\nat the instance of Sir Samuel Bentham, in the mounting of carronades\r\non a non-recoil system. Sir Samuel, who in the service of Russia had\r\narmed long-boats and other craft with ordnance thus mounted, produced\r\narguments before the navy board for attaching carronades rigidly to\r\nships’ timbers; so as to allow of no other recoil than that resulting\r\nfrom the elasticity of the carriage and the materials connecting it\r\nto the ship. The ordnance board reported against the new idea. Sir\r\nSamuel pointed out that the idea was not new. Both the largest and the\r\nsmallest pieces used on board ship (viz. the mortar and the swivel)\r\nhad always been mounted on the principle of non-recoil. He showed\r\nhow bad was the principle of first allowing a gun and its slide or\r\ncarriage to generate momentum in recoil and then of attempting to\r\nabsorb that momentum in the small stretch of a breeching-rope. He\r\nargued that a rifle held at the shoulder is not allowed to recoil: if\r\nit is, the rifleman smarts for it. He instanced the lashing of guns\r\nfast to the ship, especially in chase, for the purpose of making them\r\ncarry farther. No; the novelty consisted in preparing suitable and\r\nappropriate fastenings for intermediate sizes of guns between the\r\nmortar and the swivel. The adoption of his proposal, he contended,\r\nwould result in smaller guns’ crews, quicker loading, and greater\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these arguments certain sloops designed by him were\r\narmed on this principle; and in other cases, notably in the case\r\nof the boats used at the siege of Acre, the carronades and smaller\r\ntypes of long gun were successfully mounted and worked without recoil\r\nby attaching their carriages to vertical fir posts, built into the\r\nhull structures to serve as front pivots. But, generally, the system\r\nwas found to be impracticable. The pivots successfully withstood\r\nthe stresses of carronades fired with normal charges of powder; no\r\npermanent injury resulted to the elastic hull structures over which the\r\nblows were spread. But the factor of safety allowed by this arrangement\r\nwas insufficient to cover the wild use of ordnance in emergencies.\r\nThe regulation of charges and the prevention of double-shotting was\r\ndifficult in action, and pieces were liable to be over-charged in the\r\nexcitement of battle in a way which Sir Samuel Bentham had failed to\r\nrealize. Pivots were broken, ships’ structures strained, and the whole\r\nsystem found ill-adapted for warship requirements.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the war of 1812 that the fatal weakness of the\r\ncarronade, as primary armament, was fully revealed. The Americans had\r\nnot developed the carronade policy to the same extent as ourselves,\r\nfor transatlantic opinion was never at this period enamoured of the\r\nshort-range gun. Their well-built merchant ships, unhampered by tonnage\r\nrules or by the convoy system which had taken so much of the stamina\r\nfrom British shipping, were accustomed to trust to their speed and\r\ngood seamanship to keep an enemy at a distance. Their frigates, built\r\nunder less pedantic restrictions as to size and weight, were generally\r\nswifter, stouter and more heavily armed than ours. And, though they\r\nincluded carronades among their armament, these were not generally in\r\nso large a proportion as in our ships, and in part were represented\r\nby a superior type--the colombiad, a hybrid weapon of proportions\r\nintermediate between the carronade and the long gun. Our ships often\r\ndepended heavily upon the carronade element of their armament.\r\nExperience was soon to confirm what foresight might, surely, have\r\ndeduced: namely, that when pitted against an enemy who could choose his\r\nrange and shoot with tolerable accuracy the carronade would find itself\r\nin certain circumstances reduced to absolute impotence.\r\n\r\nThis was to be the fate and predicament of our ships on Lakes Erie and\r\nOntario, in face of the Americans. “I found it impossible to bring\r\nthem to close action,” the English commodore reported. “We remained in\r\nthis mortifying situation five hours, having only six guns in all the\r\nsquadron that would reach the enemy, not a carronade being fired.” The\r\nsame lesson was to be enforced shortly afterwards on the Americans.\r\nOne of their frigates, the _Essex_, armed almost exclusively with\r\ncarronades, was fought by an English ship, the _Phœbe_, armed with\r\nlong guns. The _Essex_, it should be noted, possessed the quality\r\nessential for a carronade armament, namely, superior speed. But the\r\n_Phœbe_ fell in with her in circumstances when, owing to damage, her\r\nsuperior speed could not be utilized. The captain of the _Phœbe_ was\r\nable to choose the range at which the action should be fought. He kept\r\nat a “respectful distance”: within range of his own long guns and out\r\nof range of his opponent’s carronades. Both sides fought well, but the\r\nresult was a foregone conclusion. The _Essex_, disabled and on fire,\r\nhad to surrender. From that time the carronade was discredited. For\r\nsome years after the peace it found a place in the armament of all\r\nclasses of British ships, but it was a fallen favourite. The French\r\ncommission which visited this country in 1835 reported that, although\r\nstill accounted part of the regular armament of older ships, the\r\ncarronade was being replaced to a great extent by light long guns in\r\nnewer construction. Opinion certainly hardened more and more against\r\nthe type, and, gradually falling into disuse, it was at last altogether\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThere was a feature of the carronade, however, which if it had been\r\nexploited might have made the story of the carronade much longer:\r\nmight, in fact, have made the carronade the starting-point of the\r\ngreat evolution which ordnance was to undergo in the second quarter\r\nof the nineteenth century. We refer to the large area of its bore, as\r\nrendering it specially suitable for the projection of hollow spheres\r\ncharged with powder or combustibles: in short, for shells. Although,\r\nas shown by the inscription on the model presented to him, General\r\nMelville’s invention covered the use of shell and carcass shot, yet\r\nthere was no general appreciation in this country, at the time of\r\nits invention, of the possibilities which the new weapon presented\r\nfor throwing charges of explosive or combustible matter against the\r\nhulls of ships. Empty hollow shot were tried in the original Smasher\r\nfor comparison against solid shot, in case the latter might prove\r\ntoo heavy;--and these, as was pointed out by an eminent writer on\r\nartillery,[89] possessed in an accentuated degree all the disadvantages\r\nof the carronade system, their adoption being tantamount to a reversion\r\nto the long-exploded granite shot of the medieval ordnance--but the\r\nuse of _filled_ shell in connection with carronades does not appear\r\nto have been seriously considered. The disadvantages of filled shell\r\nas compared with solid shot were fairly obvious; their inferiority in\r\nrange, in penetrative power, in accuracy of flight, their inability to\r\nstand double-shotting or battering charges--all these were capable of\r\nproof or demonstration. Their destructive effect, both explosive and\r\nincendiary, as compared with that of uncharged shot, was surprisingly\r\nunder-estimated. Had it been otherwise, the carronade principle would\r\nhave led naturally to the introduction of the shell gun. “The redeeming\r\ntrait in the project of General Melville,” wrote Dahlgren, “the\r\nredeeming trait which, if properly appreciated and developed, might\r\nhave anticipated the Paixhans system by half a century, was hardly\r\nthought of. The use of shells was, at best, little more than a vague\r\nconception; its formidable powers unrealized, unnoticed, were doomed to\r\nlie dormant for nearly half a century after the carronade was invented,\r\ndespite the evidence of actual trial and service.”\r\n\r\nIn other respects the carronade did good service in the development\r\nof naval gunnery. Its introduction raised (as we have seen) the whole\r\nquestion of windage and its effects, and was productive of general\r\nimprovement in the reduction and regulation of the windage in all types\r\nof gun. By it the advantages of quick firing were clearly demonstrated.\r\nAnd by its adoption in the ship-of-the-line it contributed largely to\r\nbring about that approach to uniformity of calibre which was so marked\r\na feature of the armament schemes of the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TRUCK CARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the small truck, _trochos_, or wheel on which it ran, the\r\nfour-wheeled carriage which served for centuries as a mounting for the\r\nlong guns of fighting ships has come to be known as a truck carriage:\r\nthe gun, with trunnions cast upon it, as a truck gun.\r\n\r\nArtillery being from the first an affair common, in almost all\r\nrespects, to land and to sea service, and being applied to ships as\r\nthe result of its prior development on land, it would be expected that\r\nnaval practice should in its evolution follow in the wake of that on\r\nland. And so it has, in the main, until the time of the Crimean War;\r\nsince when, completely revolutionizing and in turn revolutionized by\r\nthe rapid development of naval architecture and material, it has by far\r\nsurpassed land practice both in variety and power. But while the wooden\r\nship imposed its limitations no branch of affairs, perhaps, appeared to\r\nbe more conservative in its practice than naval gunnery. No material\r\nseemed less subject to change, no service less inclined to draw\r\nlessons from war experience. And in recent years the truck carriage\r\nhas often been taken as typifying the great lack of progress in all\r\nnaval material which existed between the sixteenth and the nineteenth\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nWhether there was in fact so great a stagnation as is commonly\r\nsupposed, and to what causes such as existed may have been due, we may\r\ndiscern from an examination of the truck carriage itself and of its\r\ndevelopment from the earliest known forms of naval gun mounting.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe first large ordnance to be used on land, having as its object\r\nthe breaching of walls and gates and the reduction of fortresses,\r\nwas mounted solidly in the ground in a way which would have been\r\nimpracticable on board a ship at sea. In time, as the energy of\r\ndischarge increased, this method of embedding the gun in soil grew\r\ndangerous: a certain recoil was necessary to absorb and carry off the\r\nlarge stresses which would otherwise have shattered the piece. In time,\r\ntoo, as the power of explosives and the strength of guns increased,\r\ntheir size diminished; cannon, as we have seen, became more portable.\r\nNo longer embedded in earth or fixed on ponderous trestles, they were\r\ntransported from place to place on wheeled carriages. And on these\r\ncarriages, massive enough to stand the shock of discharge and well\r\nadapted to allow a certain measure of recoil, the land ordnance were\r\nfired with a tolerable degree of safety.\r\n\r\nBoth of these methods were followed in principle when guns came to be\r\nused at sea.\r\n\r\nIn the early Mediterranean galley the cannon was mounted in a wooden\r\ntrough placed fore and aft on the deck in the bow of the vessel. The\r\ntrough was secured to the deck. In rear of the cannon’s breech and in\r\ncontact with it was a massive bitt of timber, worked vertically, which\r\ntook the force of the recoil. Later, as force of powder increased, this\r\nnon-recoil system of mounting ordnance failed. The cannon had to be\r\ngiven a certain length of free recoil in order that, by the generation\r\nof momentum, the energy which would otherwise be transmitted to the\r\nship in the form of a powerful blow might be safely diverted and more\r\ngradually absorbed. Hence free recoil was allowed within certain\r\nlimits, the cannon being secured with ropes or chains.\r\n\r\nBut, as had doubtless been found already with land ordnance, the\r\nviolence of recoil depended largely upon the mass of the recoiling\r\npiece; for any given conditions of discharge the heavier the gun, the\r\nless violent was its recoil. It was a natural expedient, then, to make\r\nthe recoiling mass as large as possible. And this could be effected,\r\nwithout the addition of useless and undesirable extra deadweight, by\r\nmaking the wooden trough itself partake of the recoil. The cannon was\r\ntherefore lashed solidly to the trough, and both gun and trough were\r\nleft free to recoil in the desired direction. The primitive mounting\r\nhelped, in short, by augmenting the weight of the recoiling mass, to\r\ngive a quiet recoil and some degree of control over the piece.\r\n\r\nLater, this trough or baulk of timber performed an additional function\r\nwhen used as a mounting for a certain form of gun. When the piece was\r\na breech-loader--like those recovered from the wreck of the _Mary\r\nRose_--the trough had at its rear end a massive flange projecting\r\nupwards, forming the rear working face for the wedge which secured the\r\nremovable breech chamber to the gun. “The shot and wadde being first\r\nput into the chase,” wrote Norton in 1628, “then is the chamber to be\r\nfirmly wedged into the tayle of the chase and carriage.” The mounting\r\nwas, in fact, an integral part of the gun. In the 8-inch breech-loading\r\nequipment of the _Mary Rose_ which lies in the museum of the Royal\r\nUnited Service Institution in Whitehall there is evidence of two small\r\nrear wheels. Most of these early ship carriages had two wheels, but\r\nfor the more powerful muzzle-loaders introduced toward the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century, four came into favour. With four wheels our\r\ntimber baulk has become a primitive form of the truck carriage of the\r\nsucceeding centuries.[90]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the truck carriage may more properly be regarded as a\r\nderivative of the wheeled mounting on which, as we have seen, land\r\nordnance came eventually to be worked. The ship being a floating\r\nfort, the mode of mounting the guns would be that in vogue in forts\r\nand garrisons ashore, and the land pieces and their massive carriages\r\nwould be transferred, without modification, for use on shipboard. How\r\ndifferent the conditions under which they worked! The great cannon,\r\nwhose weight and high-wheeled carriages were positive advantages\r\nwhen firing from land emplacements, suitably inclined, were found to\r\nwork at great disadvantage under sea conditions. Their great weight\r\nstrained the decks that bore them, and their wheeled carriages proved\r\ndifficult to control and even dangerous in any weather which caused\r\na rolling or pitching of the gun platform. With the introduction of\r\nportholes their unfitness for ship work was doubtless emphasized;\r\nthere was neither height nor deck-space enough to accommodate them\r\nbetween decks. Hence the necessity for a form of carriage suitable\r\nfor the special conditions of sea service, as well as for a size of\r\ngun which would be within the capacity of a ship’s crew to work. In\r\nthe early Tudor ships the forms of mounting were various: guns were\r\nmounted on two or four-wheeled carriages, or sometimes, especially the\r\nlarge bombards, upon “scaffolds” of timber.[91] By Elizabeth’s reign\r\nthe limit had been set to the size of the gun; the demi-cannon had\r\nbeen found to be the heaviest piece which could be safely mounted,\r\ntraversed, and discharged. This and the smaller guns which were plied\r\nwith such effect against the Spanish Armada were mounted on low,\r\nwheeled, wooden carriages which were the crude models from which the\r\ntruck carriage, the finished article of the nineteenth century, was\r\nsubsequently evolved. Even then the carriages had parts which were\r\nsimilar and similarly named to those of the later truck carriage; they\r\nhad trunnion-plates and sockets, capsquares, beds, quoins, axle-trees,\r\nand trucks.[92] On them the various pieces--the demi-cannons, the\r\nculverins, the basilisks and sakers--were worked by the nimble and\r\niron-sinewed seamen; run out by tackles through their ports, and\r\ntraversed by handspikes. Loaded and primed and laboriously fired by\r\nmeans of spluttering linstocks, the guns recoiled upon discharge to a\r\nlength and in a direction which could not be accurately predicted. The\r\nsmaller guns, at any rate, had no breechings to restrain them: these\r\nropes being only used for the purpose of securing the guns at sea, and\r\nchiefly in foul weather.[93]\r\n\r\nOn the whole these low sea carriages appear to have proved\r\nsatisfactory, and their continued use is evidence that they were\r\nconsidered superior to those of the land service pattern. “The fashion\r\nof those carriages we use at sea,” wrote Sir Henry Manwayring in 1625,\r\n“are much better than those of the land; yet the Venetians and others\r\nuse the other in their shipping.” In essentials the carriage remained\r\nthe same from Elizabeth to Victoria. Surviving many attempts at its\r\nsupercession in favour of mechanically complicated forms of mounting,\r\nit kept its place in naval favour for a surprising length of time;\r\nchallenging with its primitive simplicity all the elaborate mechanisms\r\nwhich pitted themselves against it.\r\n\r\nAn illuminating passage from Sir Jonas Moore’s treatise on artillery,\r\nwritten in 1689 and copied from the _Hydrographie_ of the Abbé\r\nFournier, shows at a glance the manner in which the armament of small\r\nMediterranean craft of that period was disposed, and the method on\r\nwhich the guns were mounted. “At sea the ordnance are mounted upon\r\nsmall carriages, and upon four and sometimes two low wheels without any\r\niron work. Each galley carries ordinarily nine pieces of ordnance in\r\nits prow or chase, of which the greatest, and that which delivers his\r\nshot just over the very stem, and lies just in the middle, is called\r\nthe Corsiere or ‘cannon of course’ or ‘chase cannon,’ which in time\r\nof fight doth the most effectual service. It carries generally a shot\r\nof thirty-three or forty pounds weight, and are generally very long\r\npieces. It recoils all along the middle of the galley to the mast,\r\nwhere they place some soft substance to hinder its farther recoil, that\r\nit might not endamage the mast. Next to this Corsiere are placed two\r\nMinions on each side, which carries a five or six-pound ball; and next\r\nto these are the Petrieroes, which are loaded with stone-shot to shoot\r\nnear at hand. Thirdly, there are some small pieces, which are open\r\nat the breech, and called Petrieroes a Braga, and are charged with a\r\nmoveable chamber loaded with base and bar shot, to murder near at hand.\r\nAnd the furthest from the Corsiere are the Harquebuss a Croc, which are\r\ncharged with small cross-bar shot, to cut sails and rigging. All these\r\nsmall pieces are mounted on strong pins of iron having rings, in which\r\nare placed the trunnions with a socket, so that they are easily turned\r\nto any quarter.\r\n\r\n“All the guns are mounted upon wheels and carriages; moreover the\r\nPetrieroes, which are planted in the forecastle and quarter to defend\r\nthe prow and stern, are mounted upon strong pins of iron without any\r\nreverse; the greatest pieces of battery are planted the lowest, just\r\nabove the surface of the water, the smallest in the waist and steerage,\r\nand with the Petrieroes in quarter-deck and forecastle. Upon the sea,\r\nto load great ordnance they never load with a ladle, but make use\r\nof cartridges, as well for expedition as security in not firing the\r\npowder, which in time of fight is in a continual motion.”\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a consideration of the truck carriage in detail there\r\nis an important circumstance to be noted with regard to the conditions\r\nunder which its design and supply to the naval service were regulated.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that, during almost the whole of what may be\r\ncalled the truck carriage era, the arming of ships with ordnance,\r\nthe supply of the requisite guns and their carriages, the design of\r\nthe guns and their mode of mounting, was no part of a naval officer’s\r\naffair. The Board of Ordnance had control both of land and of sea\r\nartillery. From the death of Sir William Wynter onwards the mastership\r\nof the ordnance by sea was absorbed into the mastership of the ordnance\r\nby land. From this arrangement, as may be imagined, many inconveniences\r\narose, and many efforts were made at various times to disjoin the\r\noffices and to place the armament of ships under naval control. For,\r\napart from the fact that at an early date the ordnance office acquired\r\n“an unenviable reputation for sloth and incapacity,”[94] the interests\r\nof the sea service were almost bound to suffer under such a system. And\r\nin fact the inconvenience suffered by the navy, through the delays and\r\nfriction resulting from the system whereby all dealings with guns and\r\ntheir mountings and ammunition were the work of military officials,\r\nwas notorious. The anomalous arrangement survived, in spite of the\r\nefforts of reformers, till far into the nineteenth century. Probably\r\nthe Board of Ordnance argued honestly against reintroducing a dual\r\ncontrol for land and sea artillery material. They had, at any rate,\r\nstrong interests in favour of the status quo. For, writing in the\r\nyear 1660, Sir William Slingsby noted regretfully that “the masters\r\nof the ordnance of England, having been ever since of great quality\r\nand interest, would never suffer such a collop to be cut out of their\r\nemployment.”\r\n\r\nThe arming of ships, therefore, apart from the original assignment of\r\nthe armament, remained in the province of the military authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nAn examination of the design of the perfected truck carriage and a\r\nglance at the records of its performances in action show that the\r\nadvocates of rival gun mountings were not altogether incorrect in their\r\ncontention that the manner in which the broadside armament of our ships\r\nwas mounted was wrong in principle and unsatisfactory in actual detail.\r\nThe many defects of the truck carriage were indeed only too obvious.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the breechings were so reeved that the force\r\nsustained by them in opposition to the recoil of the gun tended\r\ninevitably to cause the piece to jump. The reaction of the breeching\r\nacted along lines below the level of the gun-axis; the breeching\r\ntherefore exerted a lifting force which, instead of pressing down\r\nall of the four trucks upon the deck and thus deadening the recoil,\r\ntended to raise the fore trucks in the air and reduce the friction\r\nof the carriage upon the deck. The larger the gun and the higher the\r\ngun-axis above the trucks, the greater was this tendency of the gun\r\nto lift and overturn. If the rear trucks, about which the gun and\r\ncarriage tended to revolve, had been set at some distance in rear of\r\nthe centre of gravity of the equipment, it would have been rendered\r\nthereby more stable. But space did not permit of this. And actually\r\nthey were so placed that, when discharge was most violent, the weight\r\nof the equipment was scarcely sufficient to oppose effectively the\r\ntendency to jump. Again, the anchoring of the breeching to two points\r\nin the ship’s frames, one on either side of the gun, was wrong and\r\nliable to have serious consequences. For with this arrangement not only\r\nhad the breeching to be continuously “middled” as the gun shifted its\r\nbearing, but even when accurately adjusted the “legs” of the breeching\r\nbore an unequal strain when the gun was fired off the beam. In other\r\nwords, the horizontal angles subtended between the gun-axis, when off\r\nthe beam, and the two lines of the breeching were unequal; one side of\r\nthe breeching took more of the blow of gunfire than the other; and not\r\ninfrequently the gun carriage was thrown round violently out of the\r\nline of recoil, with damage to the equipment and injury to the crew.\r\n\r\nThe design of the carriage was in no way influenced, apparently, by a\r\ndesire to obtain a minimum area of port opening in combination with a\r\nmaximum traverse of the gun. For the broad span of the front part of\r\nthe carriage soon caused the gun to be “wooded” when slewed off the\r\nbeam. And a further disadvantage of this broad span was in the effect\r\nit had of automatically bringing the gun right abeam every time it was\r\nhauled out after loading: the front span of the carriage coming square\r\nwith the timbers of the port-sill.\r\n\r\nAs for the system of recoil, while the recoiling of the carriage with\r\nthe gun had an advantage in reducing the stresses brought on the hull\r\nstructure, yet this arrangement had the correlative disadvantage that\r\nthe carriage as well as the gun had to be hauled out again. And, as\r\nregards safety, it is a matter for surprise that the system of chocking\r\nrecoil by means of large ropes--of absorbing the momentum of a heavy\r\ngun and its carriage in a distance corresponding to the stretch of\r\nthe breechings under their suddenly applied load--was not far more\r\ninjurious than experience proved to be the case. Even so, the results\r\nobtained from it were far from satisfactory. “It is a lamentable\r\ntruth”--we quote Sir William Congreve, writing in 1811--“that numbers\r\nof men are constantly maimed, one way or another, by the recoiling of\r\nthe heavy ordnance used on board ships of war. Most of the damage is\r\ndone by the random recoil of the carriage which, moving with the gun\r\nalong no certain path, is much affected by the motion of the vessel and\r\nthe inequalities of the deck. It is difficult to know, within a few\r\nfeet, to where the carriage will come, and the greatest watchfulness\r\nis necessary on all hands to prevent accidents.” This refers, observe,\r\nto the truck gun under control. How terrible an uncontrolled gun could\r\nbe, may be read in the pages of Victor Hugo’s _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_,\r\nof which romance the breaking loose of a piece on the gun-deck of a\r\nfrigate forms a central incident. It was conjectured that the old\r\n_Victory_, Admiral Balchen’s flagship which went down off the Casquets\r\nin 1744, “mouse and man,” was lost through the breaking loose of her\r\ngreat guns in a gale.[95]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TRUCK GUN]\r\n\r\nThe accessories of the truck carriage were a source of frequent\r\naccident. The attachment of breechings and tackles to the ship’s side\r\noften involved disablement in action, the numerous bolts being driven\r\nin as missiles among the crew, who were also in danger of having their\r\nlimbs caught up in the maze of ropes and trappings with which the deck\r\nround the gun was encumbered. Considered as a mechanism the whole\r\ngun-equipment was a rude and primitive affair; the clumsy carriage\r\nrun out to battery by laborious tackles, the cast-iron gun laid by\r\na simple wedge, the whole equipment traversed by prising round with\r\nhandspikes--by exactly the same process, it has been remarked, as that\r\nby which the savage moved a log in the beginning of the world.\r\n\r\n_Why, then, did the truck carriage maintain its long supremacy?_\r\n\r\nThe answer is, that with all its acknowledged defects it had merits\r\nwhich universally recommended it, while its successive rivals exhibited\r\ndefects or disadvantages sufficient to prevent their adoption to its\r\nown exclusion. It was a case, in fact, of the survival of the fittest.\r\nAnd if we examine its various features in the light of the records\r\nof its performances in action (the truck carriage appears in the\r\nbackground of most of our naval letters and biographies), we shall\r\nunderstand why it was not easily displaced from favour with generation\r\nafter generation of our officers and seamen.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the truck carriage, a simple structure of resilient\r\nelm, with bed, cheek-plates, and trunnions strongly fitted together and\r\nsecured by iron bolts, was better adapted than any other form for the\r\nprevention of excessive stresses, resulting from the shock of recoil,\r\non either gun or ship’s structure. By the expedient of allowing the\r\nwhole gun equipment to recoil freely across the deck, by allowing the\r\nenergy of recoil to assume the form of kinetic energy given to the\r\ngun and carriage, the violent reactionary stresses due to the sudden\r\ncombustion of the gunpowder were safely diverted from the ship’s\r\nstructure, which was thus relieved of nearly the whole of the firing\r\nstresses. Moreover, by allowing the gun to recoil readily under the\r\ninfluence of the powder-gases the gun itself was saved from excessive\r\nstresses which would otherwise have shattered it. From this point of\r\nview the weight of the carriage, relatively to that of the gun, was of\r\nconsiderable importance. If the carriage had been at all too heavy it\r\nwould not have yielded sufficiently under the blow of the gun, and,\r\nhowsoever strongly made, would eventually have been destroyed, if it\r\nhad not by its inertia caused the gun to break; if too light, the\r\nviolence of the recoil would have torn loose the breechings. Actually,\r\nand as the result of a process of trial-and-error continuously\r\ncarried on, the weight of the finally evolved elm carriage was so\r\nnicely adapted to that of its gun that a recoil of the most suitable\r\nproportions was generally obtained, a free yet not too boisterous\r\nrun back. This, of course, upon an even keel. Conditions varied when\r\nthe guns were at sea upon a moving platform. With the ship heeled\r\nunder a strong wind the weather guns were often fired with difficulty\r\nowing to the violence of the recoil. On the other hand the listing of\r\nthe ship when attacking an enemy from windward favoured the lee guns\r\nby providing a natural ramp up which they smoothly recoiled and down\r\nwhich they ran by gravity to battery, as in a shore emplacement. Of\r\nwhich advantage, as we know, British sea tactics made full use at every\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nIt was strong, simple, and self-contained. Metal carriages, whose\r\nclaims were periodically under examination, proved brittle, too rigid,\r\nheavy, and dangerous from their liability to splinter. Gunslides,\r\ntraverses, or structures laid on the deck to form a definite path for\r\nthe recoil of the gun (such as the Swedish ships of Chapman’s time, for\r\nexample, carried) were disliked on account of their complication, the\r\ndeck-space occupied, and the difficulty which their use entailed of\r\nkeeping the deck under the gun dry and free from rotting; though beds\r\nlaid so as to raise the guns to the level of the ports were sometimes\r\nfitted, and were indeed a necessity in the earlier days owing to the\r\nlarge sheer and camber given to the decks. The use of compressors, or\r\nof adjustable friction devices, in any form, for limiting the recoil,\r\nwas objected to on account of the possibilities which they presented\r\nfor accident owing to the forgetfulness of an excited crew. The truck\r\ncarriage, being self-contained and independent of external adjustment,\r\nwas safe in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe four wood trucks were of the correct form and size to give the\r\nresults required. The resistance of a truck to rolling depends largely\r\nupon the relative diameters of itself and its axle. It was thus\r\npossible, by making gun-carriage trucks of small diameter and their\r\naxles relatively large, to obtain the following effect: on gunfire\r\nthe carriage started from rest suddenly, the trucks skidding on the\r\ndeck without rotating and thus checking by their friction the first\r\nviolent motion of recoil; during the latter phase of the recoil the\r\ntrucks rotated, and the carriage ran smoothly back until checked by the\r\nbreechings.\r\n\r\nThe friction of the trucks on the deck was also affected, however,\r\nby another feature of the design: the position of the trunnions\r\nrelatively to the axis of the gun. How important was this position as\r\ninfluencing the history of land artillery, we have already seen. Truck\r\nguns were nearly always “quarter-hung,” or cast with their trunnions\r\nslightly below their axis, so as to cause the breech to exert a\r\ndownward pressure on firing, and thus augment the friction of the rear\r\ntrucks on the deck and check the recoil. The position of the trunnions\r\nwas studied from yet another point of view: namely, to give the minimum\r\nof jump to the gun and ensure a smooth start to the recoil. With this\r\nobject they were so placed that the two ends of the gun were not\r\nequally balanced about the trunnion axis, but a preponderance of about\r\none-twentieth of the weight of the gun was given to the breech-end,\r\nthus bringing a slight pressure, due to deadweight alone, upon the\r\nquoin.\r\n\r\nAs for this quoin or primitive wedge by which the gun was roughly laid,\r\nthis had a great advantage over the screw (which gained a footing, as\r\nan alternative, when the carronade came into use) in that it allowed\r\nof rapid changes of elevation of the gun. Hence, though the quoin was\r\nliable to jump from its bed on gunfire and do injury to the crew, it\r\nkept its place as an accessory almost as long as the truck carriage\r\nitself survived.\r\n\r\nThere was one advantage possessed by the truck carriage which was\r\nperhaps the most important of all: its superior transportability.\r\nThe gun equipment was easily transferable, and what this meant to\r\nthe seaman may be gathered from the accounts of the way in which, in\r\nsailing-ship days, ships’ armaments were continually being shifted.\r\nThe armament, we have noted, was not embodied, as it is to-day, as an\r\nintegral part of the design of the ship. The guns and their carriages\r\nwere in the nature of stock articles, which could be changed in size,\r\nnumber and position according to the whim of the captain or the service\r\nof the ship. And there was every reason why all parties concerned, and\r\nespecially the ordnance people, should tend to standardize the forms of\r\nguns and carriages, to keep them self-contained and as independent as\r\npossible of the special requirements of individual ships or positions.\r\nThe shifting of guns was constantly going on in a commissioned ship.\r\nAt sea they were lashed against the sides so as to leave as clear\r\na deck as possible. In chase a shifting of guns, among other heavy\r\nweights, was resorted to in order that the vessel should not lose\r\nway by plunging heavily. If she set sail on a long voyage some of the\r\nguns were struck down into the hold, to stiffen her and give her an\r\nincreased stability. And on her return to harbour the guns might be\r\nremoved for examination and repair by the ordnance officials, the ship\r\nbeing laid alongside a sheer hulk for the purpose. In the days before\r\nthe sheathing of ships’ bottoms was successfully practised, and in\r\nthe absence of docks, it was constantly necessary to careen ships for\r\nthe repair of their ground-timbers, for the cleaning of their sides\r\nand the caulking of their seams. This, again, necessitated a shifting\r\nor complete removal of most of their stores and ordnance. Great\r\nadvantages were offered, therefore, from having gun-carriages compact,\r\nself-contained, and capable of being quickly removed from one place to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nHaving inspected the truck carriage in some detail, let us now briefly\r\nglance at the development of its use which took place in the last\r\nhundred years of its service, between the middle of the eighteenth and\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe stream of improvement in naval gunnery began to flow strongly under\r\nthe administration of Lord Anson. New methods of firing, experiments\r\nwith priming tubes to replace the primitive powder horns and trains\r\nof vent powder, and gun locks to replace the dangerous and unreliable\r\nslow match and linstock,[96] were under trial in the fleets commanded\r\nby Admiral Hawke, but with results not altogether satisfactory.\r\nThe locks supplied were lacking in mechanical precision, and the\r\ntubes--“very pernicious things” they were voted--were apt to fly out\r\nand wound the men. But that the unsatisfactory results obtained were\r\nnot due to defects inherent in the new devices was soon clearly proved.\r\nTwenty years later an eminent gunnery officer, Sir Charles Douglas,\r\nby perseverance and an enthusiastic attention to mechanical detail,\r\nsucceeded in making both locks and priming tubes a practical success,\r\ngreatly enhancing by their aid the rate and effectiveness of fire of\r\nthe great guns. Flint-locks of his own design he bought and fitted\r\nto the guns of his ship at his private expense. Flannel-bottomed\r\ncartridges, to replace the parchment-covered cartridges which had\r\ncaused so much fouling, and goose-quill priming tubes, were provided\r\nby him, and to him is certainly due the credit for initiating the\r\nseries of improvements in material which, trivial as they may seem in\r\ndetail, yet in the aggregate had the effect of placing our gunnery at a\r\nrelatively high level in the ensuing wars.\r\n\r\nIn addition to introducing improvements in methods of firing, Sir\r\nCharles Douglas did much to improve the efficiency of the truck\r\ncarriages themselves. On his appointment to the _Duke_ in 1779 he at\r\nonce began to put his schemes in hand. To ease the recoil of the guns\r\nand to save their breechings he devised and fitted steel springs in\r\nsome way to the latter; with such surprising good effect (he reported)\r\nthat even with a restricted length of recoil no breeching, not even\r\nthat of a 32-pounder weather gun double-shotted and fired over a\r\nslippery deck, was ever known to break. The recoil he further eased by\r\nloading the truck carriage with shot, which he slung on it, thereby\r\naugmenting the recoiling mass. He also proposed and tried another\r\napparatus having the same effect: suspended weights, secured to the\r\ncarriage by ropes reeved through fairleads, which on recoil the gun was\r\nmade to lift. Which weights also had an effect in helping to run the\r\ngun out again which he calculated to be equal to that of two extra men\r\non the tackles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the principal improvements due to Sir Charles Douglas were\r\nthose which had as their object the firing of ships’ guns on other\r\nbearings than right abeam. He realized the importance of possessing a\r\nlarge arc of training for his guns; and with this object he cleared\r\naway all possible obstructions on the gun decks of the _Duke_, removing\r\nand modifying knees, standards and pillars to allow his guns to be\r\npointed a full four points before and abaft the beam: a degree of\r\nobliquity hitherto unknown in the navy for broadside armament. To\r\ntraverse the carriages quickly to the required line of bearing he had\r\neyebolts fitted in line between the guns for attachment to the tackles;\r\nand to shorten and control the recoil and thus allow of firing on an\r\nextreme bearing in a confined space, and also to improve the rate of\r\nfire, he shod the carriage-trucks with wedges designed to act as drags.\r\n“We now dare to fire our guns without running them out,” he wrote to\r\nLord Barham, “and so as to admit of the ports being shut, with certain\r\nimpunity, even to the obliquity of three points before or abaft the\r\nbeam. A wedge properly adapted is placed behind each truck, to make up\r\nfor the reduction of space to recoil in, in firing to windward or in\r\nrolling weather. The gun first ascends the wedges by rotation, and when\r\nstopped, performs the remainder of her recoil as a sledge, so feebly\r\nas scarce to bring her breeching tight. The bottoms of the wedges, to\r\naugment their friction against the deck, are pinked, tarred, and rubbed\r\nwith very rough sand or with coarse coal dust. This method has also, I\r\nhear, been adopted in the _Union_.”\r\n\r\nIt was also adopted in the _Formidable_, in which ship Sir Charles\r\nfought as first captain to Admiral Rodney in the great fight which\r\ntook place three years after the above was written. At the Battle\r\nof the Saints not a single goose-quill failed in the _Formidable_,\r\nnor did a gun require to be wormed so long as the flannel-bottomed\r\ncartridges held out. Of the hundred and twenty-six locks fitted in\r\nthe _Duke_, only one failed; with this exception a single Kentish\r\nblack flint served for each gun throughout the whole engagement. The\r\noblique fire which our ships were enabled to employ so shattered the\r\nenemy by the unexpectedly rapid and concentrated fire poured into him,\r\nthat victory was not left long in doubt; the toll of his killed and\r\nwounded was enormous. The _Duke_, it was reckoned, fired twice as many\r\neffective shots as would have been possible under the old system. The\r\n_Formidable_ reported that two, and sometimes three, broadsides were\r\nfired at every passing Frenchman before he could bring a gun to bear in\r\nreply.[97] If all the ships of the fleet, it was said, had been able to\r\nuse their guns as they were used in these two, very few of the enemy\r\nwould have escaped. The advantage accruing to the British fleets from\r\nthe improvements initiated and developed by Sir Charles Douglas and\r\nother captains of his time was palpable and undisputed. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that the total effect produced by all these developments in\r\ngunnery material, both in this action and in those of the following\r\nwar, may have been insufficiently emphasized by historians?\r\n\r\nIt is to the war which broke out with the United States of America\r\nin 1812 that we must turn to see the truck equipment working at\r\nits highest point of efficiency. By this time the advantage of\r\ngun-sights[98] for giving accuracy of aim has been seized by a few\r\nindividual officers, and sights of various patterns have been fitted\r\nby enthusiasts. No official encouragement is given, however, to\r\nexperiments with sights and scales and disparting devices, and once\r\nagain it is left to private initiative and expense to make a further\r\nadvance toward efficiency. Applications for gun-sights are rejected\r\nduring the war on the ground that these novelties are “not according to\r\nthe regulation of the Service.”[99]\r\n\r\nThese are the circumstances in which a certain vessel in the royal navy\r\nexhibits such a superiority in gunnery over her contemporaries as to\r\nrender her conspicuous at the time and, for several decades afterwards,\r\nthe accepted model by which all such as care may measure themselves.\r\n\r\nThe _Shannon_, nominally a 38-gun frigate, carried twenty-eight\r\n18-pounder long guns on her gun deck and fourteen carronades,\r\n32-pounders, upon her quarter-deck and forecastle; in addition to four\r\nlong 9-pounders. She was commanded by Captain Philip Broke, whose fame\r\nas a gallant commander is secure for all time but whose attainments in\r\nthe realm of gunnery have been less widely appreciated. Captain Broke,\r\npossessing a keen insight into the possibilities of the _Shannon’s_\r\narmament, set himself to organize, from the first day of his ship’s\r\nmemorable commission, her crew and material for the day of battle.\r\nNo other ship of the time was so highly organized. For all the guns\r\nsighting arrangements were provided by him. To each gun-carriage\r\nside-scales of his own design were attached, marked with a scale of\r\ndegrees and showing by means of a plumb-bob the actual heel of the\r\nship; so that every gun could be laid by word of command at any desired\r\nangle of elevation. For giving all guns a correct bearing a circle was\r\ninscribed on the deck round every gun-port, degrees being represented\r\nby grooves cut in the planks and inlaid with white putty; by which\r\ndevice concentration of fire of a whole battery was rendered possible,\r\nthe sheer of the ship being compensated for by cutting down the\r\ncarriages and adjusting them with spirit-levels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHOD OF GUN-EXERCISE IN H.M.S. “SHANNON”\r\n\r\nFrom a pamphlet by Captain S. J. Pechell, R.N.]\r\n\r\nBeside these improvements applied to his material--steps which seem\r\nsimple and obvious to-day, but which were far-sighted strides in\r\n1812--the training of his personnel was a matter to which he paid\r\nunremitting attention. His gunners were carefully taught the mysteries\r\nof the dispart. Gun drill was made as realistic as possible and prizes\r\nwere given out of his private purse for the winners of the various\r\ncompetitions. Often a beef cask, with a piece of canvas four feet\r\nsquare attached to it, was thrown overboard as a target, the ship\r\nbeing laid to some three hundred yards away from it. The captain’s log\r\nwas full of such entries as: “Seamen at target,” “fixed and corrected\r\nnine-pounder sights,” “mids at target and carronade,” “swivels in\r\nmaintop,” “practised with musket,” “exercised at the great guns,” etc.\r\netc. Systematic instruction in working the guns, fixing sights and\r\nreading scales, was carried out. And a method of practising gun-laying,\r\nwhich later came to be used in other ships from the example set by the\r\n_Shannon_, is illustrated by the accompanying sketch. A gun was taken\r\nonto the quarter-deck and secured; a spar was placed in its muzzle with\r\na handspike lashed across it; and then two men surged the gun by means\r\nof the handspike to imitate the rolling of the ship, while the captain\r\nof the gun, crouching behind it, looked along his line of sight for the\r\ntarget (a disc placed in the forepart of the ship) and threw in the\r\nquoin when he had taken aim.\r\n\r\nWith such a training did the captain of the _Shannon_ prepare for the\r\nduel which fortune was to give him with the _Chesapeake_. The pick\r\nof the British fleets was to meet an American of average efficiency.\r\nSuperiority of gunnery would have decided that famous action in favour\r\nof the former, it may safely be said, whatever the conditions in which\r\nit had been fought. At long range the deliberate and practised aim\r\nof the _Shannon’s_ 18-pounders would have overborne even the good\r\nindividual shooting of an American crew. At night or in foggy weather\r\nor in a choppy sea the _Shannon’s_ arrangements for firing on a given\r\nbearing and at a given elevation would have given her the superiority.\r\nAs it happened, the combined and correct fire at pistol range, of\r\nlong gun and carronade--the long gun, double-shotted, searching the\r\n_Chesapeake’s_ decks with ball and grape, the carronade splintering her\r\nlight fir-lined sides and spreading death and destruction among the\r\ncrew--quickly secured a victory, and showed the naval world the value\r\nof high ideals in the technique of gunnery.\r\n\r\nIn the _Shannon_ we have the high-water mark of smooth-bore gunnery.\r\nFrom that time onward, in spite of the precedents which her captain\r\ncreated, little appears to have been done in the way of extending his\r\nmethods or of applying his improvements to the armament of the navy\r\ngenerally. As a consequence, relatively to the continuously improving\r\ndefensive efficiency of the ships themselves there was an actual\r\ndecline in the efficiency of the truck gun after the American War: a\r\ndecline which culminated in Navarino. It was a time when “new-fangled\r\nnotions,” developments of method and material, were viewed with strong\r\nsuspicion, even with resentment, by many of the most influential of\r\nnaval officers. In the case of the truck gun, strong prejudices reacted\r\nagainst the general introduction of such refinements as had admittedly\r\nbeen found effective in exceptional cases, and the demand still went\r\nup for everything in connection with gunnery to be “coarsely simple.”\r\nTo many it doubtless seemed impolitic, to say the least, that anything\r\nshould be done in the way of mechanical development which would have\r\nthe effect of substituting pure skill for the physical force and\r\nendurance, in the exertion of which the British seaman so obviously\r\nexcelled. The truck gun was merely the rough medium by which this\r\nphysical superiority gained the desired end, and it had been proved\r\nwell suited to the English genius. Nothing more was asked than a rough\r\nequality of weapons. The arguments used against such finesse in gunnery\r\nas that used by the commander of the _Shannon_ were much the same, it\r\nmay be imagined, as those used at an earlier date (and with better\r\nreason) to prohibit the use of the mechanically worked crossbow in\r\nfavour of the simple longbow, strung by the athletic arm of the English\r\narcher.\r\n\r\nThat little was done for years to improve the truck gun equipment, is\r\nevident from a letter, written in 1825 by Captain S. J. Pechell and\r\naddressed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean squadron,\r\ndeploring the defective equipment of ships’ guns. Even at this date,\r\nit appears, few of the guns were properly disparted, few had sights\r\nor scales fitted to them. No arrangements had yet been generally\r\nadapted for permitting horizontal, or what Captain Broke had called\r\n“blindfold” firing; or for laying all the guns together by word of\r\ncommand. The truck carriages still gave insufficient depression,\r\npreventing a ship from firing her weather guns at point-blank when\r\nlisted more than four degrees. The quantity of powder and shot allowed\r\nfor exercise only amounted to one shot for each captain of a gun in\r\nseven months. No instruction was given in sighting or fixing sights, no\r\nsystem of instruction in principles was followed. And once again, as\r\nin the seventeenth century, the disadvantage under which naval gunnery\r\nlaboured by reason of the dual control in all matters pertaining to the\r\nordnance was strongly felt. “It is singular,” wrote Captain Pechell,\r\n“that the arming of a ship is the only part of her equipment which has\r\nnot the superintendence of a Naval Officer. We have no sea Officer at\r\nthe Ordnance to arrange and decide upon the proper equipment of Ships\r\nof War; or to carry into effect any improvement which experience might\r\nsuggest. It is in this way that everything relating to the Ordnance\r\non board a Man of War has remained nearly in the same state for the\r\nlast thirty years; and is the only department (I mean the naval part\r\nof it) that has not profited by experience or encouraged Officers\r\nto communicate information. Much might be done now that the Marine\r\nArtillery are stationed at Portsmouth. At present it is not even\r\ngenerally known that a manual exercise exists.... If some such system\r\nwere adopted, we should no longer consider the length of an action at\r\nits principal merit; the _Chesapeake_ was beat in eleven minutes!”\r\n\r\nCaptain Pechell was a firm believer in the desirability of developing\r\nto its utmost British material. He had an enthusiastic belief,\r\nmoreover, in the possibilities of his personnel; and stated his\r\nconviction that officers were only too anxious to be given the chance\r\nof instruction, prophesying an emulation among them and as great a\r\ndesire to be distinguished “in gunnery as in Seamanship.” His advocacy\r\nof a system of gunnery training bore fruit later in the establishment\r\nof the _Excellent_ at Portsmouth. The scheme for the development of a\r\ncorps of scientific naval officers, which had been foreshadowed by Sir\r\nHoward Douglas in his classic treatise on Naval Gunnery and which was\r\nformulated later in detail by Captain Pechell, was one of the reforms\r\nbrought to maturity by Sir James Graham in the year 1832.\r\n\r\nThrough all the subsequent changes of armament up to the Crimean War,\r\nfrom solid shot to shell-fire, the truck carriage maintained its place\r\nof favour. In 1811 Colonel (afterwards Sir William) Congreve had\r\npublished a treatise demonstrating the defects of the truck carriage\r\nand proposing in its place a far more scientific and ingenious form of\r\nmounting. It lacked, however, some of the characteristics which, as we\r\nhave seen, gave value to the old truck carriage. Except where special\r\nconditions gave additional value to its rival, the truck carriage\r\nkept its place. In 1820 an iron carriage was tried officially, for\r\n24-pounders, but gave unsatisfactory results. In 1829 the Marshall\r\ncarriage was tried, offering important advantages over the standard\r\npattern. Its main feature was a narrow fore-carriage separate from the\r\nrecoiling rear portion, this fore-carriage being pivoted to a socket in\r\nthe centre of the gun-port. But still the truck carriage survived the\r\nvery favourable reports given on its latest rival.\r\n\r\nAs concentration of fire became developed new fittings such as\r\ndirecting bars, breast chocks and training racers made their appearance\r\nand were embodied in its design. As the power of guns and the energy\r\nrequiring to be absorbed on recoil increased, the rear trucks\r\ndisappeared and gave place, in the two-truck Marsilly carriage, to\r\nflat chocks which by the friction of their broad surfaces against the\r\ndeck helped more than trucks to deaden the motion of the carriage.\r\nThe quoin, perfected by the addition of a graduated scale marked\r\nto show the elevation corresponding to each of its positions, gave\r\nplace at length to various mechanical forms of elevating gear. The\r\nelm body was replaced by iron plates bolted and riveted together. And\r\nthen at length, with the continuous growth of gun-energy, the forces\r\nof recoil became so great that the ordinary carriage constrained by\r\nrope breechings could no longer cope with them. The friction of wood\r\nrear-chocks against the deck was replaced by the friction of vertical\r\niron plates, attached to the carriage, against similar plates attached\r\nto a slide interposed between carriage and deck, and automatically\r\ncompressed: the invention, it is said, of Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy. The\r\ntruck carriage, as it had been known for centuries, had at last been\r\nleft behind in the evolution of naval artillery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the advent of modern gun mountings the old anomaly of the divided\r\nresponsibility of War Office and Admiralty became unbearable; the\r\nnecessity for a close adaptation of each gun to its ship-position,\r\nfor careful co-ordination of the work of artillerist, engineer and\r\nshipbuilder, produced a crisis which had important effects on future\r\nnaval administration. A single paragraph will suffice to show the\r\nposition as it presented itself in the early ’sixties. “There were a\r\nthousand points of possible collision,” wrote the biographer of Captain\r\nCooper Key, the captain of the _Excellent_, “as it became more and more\r\ncertain that gun carriages, instead of being loose movable structures\r\ncapable of being used in any port, were henceforth to be fixed in the\r\nparticular port which was adapted for them, with special pivoting bolts\r\nand deck racers--all part of the ship’s structure. Where the War Office\r\nwork began and the Controller’s ended in these cases, no one knew, but\r\nthe captain of the _Excellent_ came in as one interfering between a\r\nmarried pair, and was misunderstood and condemned on both sides.”\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the solution was found. Captain Cooper Key was appointed to the\r\nAdmiralty as Director-General of Naval Ordnance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SHELL GUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief function of land artillery in its earlier days was the\r\ndestruction of material. The huge engines of the ancients were of\r\nvalue in effecting from a safe distance what the tortoise and the\r\nbattering-ram could only do at close quarters: the breaching of\r\nwalls and the battering-in of gates, doors and bulwarks. After the\r\ninvention of gunpowder the use of artillery remained, we have seen,\r\nsubstantially the same. Apart from the moral effect on horse and man of\r\nthe “monstrous roare of noise” when in defence, the offensive object of\r\nordnance was almost entirely the breaching of the enemy’s works. The\r\nguns were literally “pieces of battery,” doing their slow work by the\r\nmomentum of their large projectiles.\r\n\r\nThus considered, artillery was not a very effective instrument.\r\nAnd, just as in earlier times it had been sought to supplement mere\r\nimpact by other effects--by the throwing into besieged fortresses of\r\nquicklime, for instance, “dead horses and other carrion,”--so, after\r\nthe arrival of gunpowder, endeavour was made to substitute incendiarism\r\nor explosion for the relatively ineffective method of impact. The use\r\nof grenades, hand-thrown, was discovered. And then followed, as a\r\nmatter of course, their adaptation to the mortars already in use for\r\nthe projection of stones and other solid material. These mortars, as in\r\nthe case of the early cannon, were at first made of an inconveniently\r\nlarge size; and, also as in the case of cannon, they came later to\r\nbe cast of more moderate proportions to facilitate their transport\r\nand thus render them more serviceable for operations in the field.\r\nArtillery was now devoting its attention to the personnel. The result\r\nof this evolution was the howitzer, a weapon whose value to land armies\r\nwas greatly enhanced by the discovery, by Marshal Vauban at the end\r\nof the seventeenth century, of the efficacy of the _ricochet_. Under\r\nthis system the fuzed bomb or grenade, instead of being projected\r\nfrom a mortar set at a high elevation, to describe a lofty and almost\r\nparabolic trajectory, was discharged from a howitzer at a sufficiently\r\nlow elevation to cause it to strike the ground some distance short of\r\nits objective, whence it proceeded, leaping and finally rolling along\r\nthe ground till it came to its target, where it exploded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo far shell fire had developed on land. In sea warfare the solid\r\ncannon ball remained the orthodox missile; the use of explosive or\r\nincendiary shells was deemed so dangerous a practice as to forbid\r\nits acceptance by the great maritime powers, save in exceptional\r\ncases, until the nineteenth century. Toward the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury serious consideration was given, by France especially, to the\r\npossibilities of shell fire. Frenchmen felt restless and dissatisfied\r\nwith the conditions in which they were waging war with England. Sea\r\nordnance, which in the past had wrought so much by the destruction\r\nof personnel, was becoming increasingly impotent, not only against\r\npersonnel but against ships themselves. Trafalgar came as a proof\r\nof this, when not a single ship was sunk by gunfire. Sea fighting\r\nwas again resolving itself into a straightforward physical struggle\r\nbetween the guns’ crews of the opposing fleets, in which struggle\r\nthe victory went by attrition to the side which plied its guns with\r\nthe greatest rapidity and perseverance. Élan, enthusiasm, science,\r\nthe mental alertness of the individual, were bound to be overborne\r\nin such a case by superior endurance, physique, coolness, and sound\r\nworkmanship. Both sides had a profound belief in the superiority of\r\ntheir personnel in hand-to-hand conflict. Where fighting was, as in\r\nthe earliest days of the rival navies, “man to man, lance to lance,\r\narrow to arrow, stone to stone,” success depended entirely upon\r\ncourage and physical strength; and in such cases, says Nicolas, the\r\nEnglish were almost always victorious. If, stated a French writer, sea\r\nactions could be decided by hand-to-hand combat the arms of France\r\nwould triumph. But sea fights were in fact almost solely a matter of\r\nartillery. If only the conditions of battle could be altered; if only\r\nthe forces of incendiarism or explosion could be summoned to put the\r\nenemy ships-of-the-line in jeopardy, a short cut to victory might be\r\nfound or, at any rate, the superiority of England in material might be\r\nseriously depreciated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome time was to elapse, however, before France was to see even the\r\npartial consummation of this fervent desire.\r\n\r\nWhile the use of grenades, bombs, carcasses and other explosive\r\nand incendiary missiles had been recognized on land for centuries,\r\nan event occurred in the year 1788 which, coming to the ears of\r\nEurope, should have had considerable effect in turning the thoughts\r\nof artillerists to the possibilities of their use at sea. In that\r\nyear, some sixty-five years before the action off Sinope, a Deptford\r\nshipwright who had risen to high service under the Russian government\r\nfitted out for his employers a flotilla of long-boats for an attack\r\nupon a Turkish squadron. These long-boats Sir Samuel Bentham--he was\r\nthe ex-shipwright--armed with brass ordnance mounted on his favourite\r\nnon-recoil system, and for them he requisitioned a large supply of\r\nshells, carcasses and solid shot. At the mouth of the Liman river in\r\nthe Sea of Azov the Russians, with these insignificant war vessels,\r\nattacked a very superior force of Turkish ships, and gained a complete\r\nvictory. The effect of the shells, fired at close range into the\r\nTurkish ships, was startling and impressive. Great holes were torn in\r\nthe sides of the vessels, and fires were started which, in a favouring\r\nmedium of dry timber and paint and pitch, rapidly spread and caused the\r\nsquadron’s destruction.\r\n\r\nNo evidence can be quoted, it must be admitted, to show that\r\ncontemporary opinion realized how portentous was this sea action;\r\nno stress is laid on the event in histories relating to that time.\r\nNor does another event which occurred at this period appear to have\r\ncaused the notice it deserved: the firing, at the suggestion of a\r\nCaptain Mercier, 35th Regiment, of mortar shells from the British\r\nlong 24-pounders, from Gibraltar into the Spanish lines.[100] Nor\r\nwas Lieutenant Shrapnel’s contemporaneous invention,[101] of a\r\nshell containing case shot explodable by a small bursting charge,\r\ndeveloped or the possible adaptation of its use for sea warfare fully\r\nappreciated. Or, if authority did discern the eventual effect of these\r\ninnovations, a wholesome dread of their extension and development\r\nin naval warfare appears to have dictated a policy of calculated\r\nconservatism in respect of them, a suppression of all ideas and\r\nexperiments which had in view any intensifying or improvement of\r\nour artillery methods. “So long as foreign powers did not innovate\r\nby improving their guns, by extending the use of carronades and,\r\nabove all, by projecting shells horizontally from shipping; so long\r\nit was our interest not to set the example of any improvement in\r\nnaval ordnance--the value of our immense material might otherwise be\r\ndepreciated. Many of the defects which were known to exist, so long\r\nas they were common to all navies, operated to the advantage of Great\r\nBritain.”[102]\r\n\r\nApart from this consideration, however, it is remarkable how small a\r\nvalue was set by English opinion, even at a late date, upon explosive\r\nas compared with solid projectiles. The obvious disadvantages of\r\nhollow spherical shell--their smaller range, more devious flight and\r\nless penetrative power--were emphasized; their admittedly greater\r\ndestructive effect (even taking into account the small bursting charges\r\ndeemed suitable for use with them) was rated at a surprisingly low\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThe French, on the other hand, showed great eagerness to explore the\r\npossibilities of shell fire in fighting ships. Addicted to science,\r\nthey searched unceasingly throughout the revolutionary wars for some\r\ndevelopment of naval material which would neutralize the obvious\r\nand ever-increasing superiority of the British navy under existing\r\nconditions, even if it might not actually incline the balance of\r\npower in their favour. To this end they courted the use of incendiary\r\nprojectiles. Our own authorities, partly from a lively apprehension\r\nof the danger believed to be inherent in their carriage and use in\r\nwooden ships and partly from a feeling of moral revulsion against\r\nthe employment of what they genuinely believed to be an unfair and\r\nunchivalrous agency, limited the use of fuzed shells, carcasses and\r\nother fireworks as much as possible to small bomb vessels of special\r\nconstruction--and inferior morals. But in ships-of-the-line the use\r\nof such missiles was strongly deprecated by naval opinion, and even\r\nthe use of hand-grenades in the tops was forbidden by some captains.\r\nTime justified this cautious attitude. The French suffered for the\r\nprecipitancy with which they adopted inflammatory agents; fires and\r\nexplosions were frequent in their fleets; the history of their navy in\r\nthese wars--“la longue et funeste guerre de la Révolution”--is lit up\r\nfrom time to time with the conflagrations of their finest ships, prey\r\nto the improperly controlled chemical forces of their own adoption. One\r\nexample alone need be cited: the _Orient_ at the battle of the Nile.\r\nEven if the French flagship was not set on fire by their direct agency,\r\nsmall doubt exists that the spread of the fire which broke out in her\r\nwas accelerated by the presence of the combustibles which, in common\r\nwith most of the French ships, she carried. Throughout the wars fuzed\r\nshells, carcasses, stinkpots, port-fires, proved far more terrible to\r\nfriend than foe. And the foe doubtless felt confirmed and fortified in\r\nhis opinions that such substances were quite unsuitable for carriage\r\nin warships. As to the ethics of explosives even the French themselves\r\nseem to have been doubtful. For, shortly after the battle in Aboukir\r\nBay, some of their officers accused an English captain of having been\r\nso “unfair” as to use shells: an audacious manœuvre on their part,\r\nfor, on some of the shells in question being produced and the gunner\r\nquestioned as to whence they came, “to the confusion of the accusers,\r\nhe related that they were found on board the _Spartiate_, one of the\r\nships captured on the first of August!”[103]\r\n\r\nContinuous trials were carried out in France with shells fired\r\nfrom guns. In 1798, following a series of successful experiments,\r\ntrials were prosecuted at Meudon by a special commission, who caused\r\n24-and 36-pound shells to be fired at a target representing a\r\nship-of-the-line, at ranges of 400 and 600 yards. The results were\r\nimpressive, and the report rendered to Bonaparte such as to confirm\r\nhis personal conviction in the value of shell fire. Less than a year\r\nlater, we may note in passing, the Consul was himself the target of\r\nshell fire: being subjected, at the siege of Acre, to the unpleasant\r\nattentions of a 68-pounder carronade from the English fleet. In 1804,\r\nwith the avowed object of keeping our cruisers at a distance, he had\r\nlong howitzers cast and placed for the defence of Toulon and other\r\nports. And hardly a year passed but some trial was made of horizontal\r\nfire of shells from guns and mortars.\r\n\r\nOf the two great maritime powers, Britain had contributed more,\r\nperhaps, towards the building up by actual practice of the system of\r\nartillery which was shortly to come into vogue. Shell fire from mortars\r\nhad been used with far more effect by her forces than by those of her\r\ngreat enemy. The invention of the carronade was in itself almost a\r\nsolution; and, though it did not lead directly to the shell gun, yet\r\nit undoubtedly induced the weapon which most strongly resembled it:\r\nthe medium ship-gun, as designed by Congreve and Blomefield, which was\r\nsomething between the carronade and the long gun, and which for a time\r\nwas mounted in our two-decked ships for the purpose of preserving unity\r\nof calibre.\r\n\r\nBut the French, free from the bias against change of method and\r\nmaterial which operated in this country, seized on the possibilities\r\nof existing elements, and combined them in such a way as to form a\r\ncomplete solution of the shell-fire problem. To General Paixhans,\r\nthe eminent officer of artillery, the credit for this solution is\r\nundoubtedly due.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe experiments of M. Paixhans, carried out in order to confirm the\r\ntheories on which his new system was founded, extended over several\r\nyears and resulted in the publication of two books--the _Nouvelle Force\r\nMaritime et Artillerie_, 1822, and _Expériences faites sur une Arme\r\nNouvelle_, 1825.\r\n\r\nIn these works[104] the author developed in detail the scheme of ship\r\narmament which was to win adoption, in the course of time, in the\r\nFrench navy; whereby our own authorities were also gradually forced to\r\nabandon methods and standards of force by which the British navy had\r\ngrown great. Two principles formed the basis of this scheme:--(1) unity\r\nof calibre, embodying the maximum simplification of means; (2) shell\r\nfire, embodying the maximum augmentation of effect.\r\n\r\nOn these two principles M. Paixhans reared and elaborated in minutest\r\ndetail the revolutionary system with which his name is associated.\r\nNo new element or discovery was necessary for giving effect to his\r\ndesigns. Indeed he expressly disclaimed having introduced any novelty:\r\n“Nous n’avons donc rien inventé, rien innové, et presque rien changé;\r\nnous avons seulement réuni des élémens épars, auxquels il suffisait\r\nde donner, avec un peu d’attention, la grandeur et les proportions\r\nconvenables, pour atteindre le but important que nous étions proposé.”\r\nIt may be said, in fact, that unity of calibre had been an ideal sought\r\nfor years before M. Paixhans’ time; while shell fire, the New Arm of\r\n1822, was almost the logical consequence of Robins’ discoveries in\r\nthe principles of gunnery, extended as they were by the researches\r\nof Doctors Hutton and Gregory. In particular, mention is made by M.\r\nPaixhans himself of two of the results brought out by Dr. Hutton’s\r\nexperiments: one, that the length of the bore of a gun has but a\r\nsmall effect upon the range of its projectile, the range varying as\r\nthe fifth root of the length; two, that the muzzle velocity may be\r\nconsidered to be independent of the weight of the gun.\r\n\r\nAs to the lack of novelty of shell fire on ship-board, M. Paixhans\r\ngives a significant extract from French naval annals. In 1690, it\r\nappears, a M. Deschiens had invented a means of firing bombs from long\r\nguns horizontally, instead of parabolically as from mortars. This\r\nsecret was of great use to him; for, falling in with four English ships\r\nat sea, he so surprised them by this new invention that, fearful of\r\nbeing set on fire, they drew off and did not attempt to renew battle.\r\nThis same French captain at a later date attacked two Dutch ships more\r\nthan a match for him, and, by means of these horizontally fired bombs,\r\nsank one and disabled the other. But M. Deschiens died and his secret\r\nwith him; though, as M. Paixhans remarks, this “secret” would have been\r\neasy to find if anyone had looked for it.\r\n\r\nA whole chapter of _The Genuine Use and Effects of the Gunne_, written\r\nby Robert Anderson and published at London in 1674, concerns “the\r\nshooting of Granados out of Long Gunnes.”\r\n\r\nBriefly, the grand idea of M. Paixhans consisted in the establishment\r\nof a fleet of steam vessels armed with guns designed to project\r\ncharged shells horizontally at considerable velocities. But as this\r\nconsummation could only be attained by degrees, he proposed that in\r\nthe meantime the existing French fleet should be re-armed in such a\r\nway as to give to each ship a maximum of force combined with unity of\r\ncalibre. This part of his scheme was applicable to solid shot (_boulets\r\nmassifs_) as well as to shell (_boulets creux_). But the former he\r\nconsidered too ineffectual for use in future sea engagements. Although\r\nthey might be the most suitable projectiles for the destruction of land\r\nworks, the breaching of ramparts and the battering of stone walls,\r\nyet hollow shot, filled with powder and other combustible material,\r\nwere far better adapted to rend and set fire to defences of wood,\r\nimpregnated with tar, and, in time of action, replete with every\r\nspecies of inflammable substance, and crowded with combatants. No, M.\r\nPaixhans hoped to make solid shots entirely obsolete, by adopting,\r\nin combination with small steam vessels, or, for the present, in\r\ncombination with the existing fleets of sailing ships, an ordnance\r\nspecially dedicated to shell fire, and to shell fire alone. By its\r\nmeans the enormous superiority of Great Britain would be effectually\r\neliminated, or transferred into the hands of France; her material\r\nwould be rendered suddenly obsolete, her maritime power would shrivel;\r\nand the power of France would be augmented to such a degree that the\r\ndefeat of these islands might at last be encompassed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the amiable intention of M. Paixhans.\r\n\r\nThe arguments which he employed in favour of his revolutionary\r\nproposals are of sufficient interest and importance, perhaps, to merit\r\nconsideration. The past histories of the two navies showed, he argued,\r\nthat the introduction of improvement or of innovation into either navy\r\nwas shortly afterwards followed by its introduction into the other;\r\nso that there was never any important change in the relative naval\r\nstrength of the two nations. It followed, therefore, that the only\r\nmeans by which power could be wrested from the possessor of it, must be\r\nsuch a change of system as would render useless the existing means by\r\nwhich that power was sustained. How could this be accomplished? Foreign\r\nnations had always felt the innate strength of England, residing in the\r\nrace of splendid seamen (a highly specialized profession) who formed\r\nso great a part of her population. France especially had felt her own\r\nweakness in not possessing a reserve, a nursery of seamen, such as\r\nEngland had. If only seamanship could be discounted----! M. Paixhans\r\nproceeded to show that the coming of the steamer was itself an event\r\nwhich would go a long way to discount a superiority in seamanship. The\r\naccursed English “devil boat,”[105] which had begun to spread its pall\r\nof smoke over all the northern waters, might be, in truth, a potent\r\nfriend to France. Steam vessels required only a small and unskilled\r\npersonnel to man them, instead of prime seamen. Steam vessels could\r\nalways outstrip sailing ships, and thus could choose their own range\r\nand accept or decline battle as occasion required. Moreover, the\r\neffect of shell fire would be to upset completely the balance of power\r\nexisting between big ships and little ships, as such. Instead of size\r\nbeing a measure of power, it would be a measure of vulnerability. The\r\nlarger the ship the more she would be endangered. Costly three-deckers\r\nwould cease to exist, and in their place small steam vessels, fast\r\nand heavily armed, easily manœuvred and perhaps encased in armour,\r\nwould hold power. Thus the great obstacle to the acquirement by France\r\nof a large naval force--the necessity for a numerous and experienced\r\npersonnel--would be easily removed. In short, the adoption of his\r\nscheme would in any case be most favourable to France. Even if it were\r\nsimultaneously adopted by Great Britain its adoption would at least\r\nensure that in future the naval power of the two states would be in\r\nproportion to the strength of their _whole_ population, instead of only\r\nthat part of it familiarized with maritime affairs.\r\n\r\nConsidering first the conversion of the existing French navy, he\r\nexamined and enlarged upon the various inefficiencies inherent in\r\nthe usual disposition of ship armaments; in the manner in which the\r\nunit and the number of units of artillery force were selected for any\r\nindividual design of ship; in the variety of the units, and in the\r\nlack of system observed in the various proportions between the gun,\r\nthe charge and the projectile. He observed that the constant tendency\r\nof development, both in the French and in the English navy, was in\r\nthe replacing of smaller by greater calibres, by which process the\r\ndiversity of calibres was diminished and the effective force of the\r\narmament increased. Continuing this process, it appeared that the\r\nideal armament would be reached, the maximum degree of force would\r\nbe attained, when unity of calibre was achieved. When the calibre\r\nof the largest-sized cannon carried on the principal gun deck of\r\nships-of-the-line was adopted as the sole calibre used, the maximum\r\nof force would be attained: the greatest possible destructive effect\r\ncombined with the greatest possible simplification of means. These\r\nremarks applied equally to a solid shot and to a shell gun armament. If\r\nfor some reason it were decided not to adopt shell fire, nevertheless\r\nit would be of advantage to re-arm the French sailing fleets on this\r\nprinciple, with guns of one calibre.\r\n\r\nM. Paixhans proposed as the unit the French 36-pounder. He explained\r\nthe advantages to be derived from arming existing ships-of-the-line\r\nwith 36-pounders all of the same calibre but of different weights on\r\nthe respective decks. The guns on different decks would take different\r\ncharges and would therefore project the shot with different muzzle\r\nvelocities. They would be disposed, the heaviest on the lower deck;\r\na lighter type (reamed out from 24-pounders) on the main deck; still\r\nlighter guns on the upper deck, and 36-pounder carronades on the\r\nquarter-deck and forecastle would complete the armament.\r\n\r\nThe employment of solid shot was not favoured by him, however, and\r\nhe claimed the results of various trials as showing the superior\r\noffensive value of shells, when compared with solid shot. Comparing a\r\nsolid shot and a shell of the same external dimensions discharged with\r\nthe same muzzle velocity, the former, he said, had only the advantage\r\nin superior range and penetrative power. The latter, while having a\r\nrange greater than those at which sea actions were invariably fought\r\nand sufficient penetrative power to effect a lodgment in a ship’s\r\ntimbers, required less powder to propel it, a lighter and therefore\r\nmore rapidly worked gun from which to discharge it, and it had a\r\ndestructive effect enormously greater than that of the solid ball.\r\n\r\nThe complete proposal therefore involved the adoption of shell guns\r\nexclusively, new guns being made and old guns being reamed out as\r\nnecessary to enable each ship to carry pieces of one calibre alone. The\r\ncalibre proposed as unit was the long French 48-pounder. And, as an\r\nexample of the way in which M. Paixhans would convert armaments, the\r\ncase of the French 74-gun ship is here taken. This, with an existing\r\narmament of:--\r\n\r\n  28 36-pounders,\r\n  30 18-pounders,\r\n  14 6-pounders,\r\n  14 6-pounder carronades,\r\n\r\na total of 86 pieces throwing 2250 pounds of solid shot, he would\r\nconvert into a ship armed with:--\r\n\r\n  28 48-pounders (reamed from 36-pounders),\r\n  30 48-pounders (of same weight as 18-pounders),\r\n  28 48-pounder carronades;\r\n\r\neighty-six pieces throwing 3010 pounds of charged shell weighing 35\r\npounds each.\r\n\r\nFor the new shell gun he proposed a design of iron howitzer in which\r\nthe distribution of metal was so adjusted as to give a sufficient\r\nfactor of safety at every section, while at the same time allowing\r\nthe total weight of the piece to be reduced to a minimum. This\r\n_canon-à-bombe_ was to be mounted on a stable form of carriage, made\r\nwithout trucks but fitted with running-out rollers and directing bars\r\nto control the line of fire and the direction of recoil.\r\n\r\nTo those who were inclined to regard with feelings of horror this new\r\nuse of explosive missiles, this progress in the art of destruction,\r\nthe inventor put the question, whether experience had not proved\r\nthat the perfection of arms had not had the effect of making warfare\r\nactually less bloody; whether it was not a fact worth consideration,\r\nthat, while in days of old the destruction and loss of life in battles\r\nwas enormous, the loss of English seamen by gunfire in the numerous\r\ncombats of three long and bitter wars of recent times amounted to\r\nless than five thousand killed. And would not, therefore, further\r\ndevelopment of arms be a positive benefit to humanity?[106]\r\n\r\nOne other feature was put forward to complete this scheme of\r\nre-armament, the importance of which it is unnecessary to emphasize.\r\nM. Paixhans explored the possibility, by the sacrifice of a tier or\r\nmore of guns, of rendering all classes of ships invulnerable by casing\r\ntheir sides with iron plates. Although rejected at the time, and as\r\nthe result of trials which he himself carried out, this suggestion was\r\ndestined to be carried into effect in startling fashion some thirty\r\nyears later: with what consequences to naval architecture we shall\r\npresently see. In connection with the scheme of re-armament outlined\r\nby M. Paixhans in 1822 the suggestion was important in that there was\r\nimplied in it an admission of one of the two weak features of the\r\ninventor’s system. The shell gun would lose its superiority over the\r\nshot gun, and might indeed be reduced to absolute impotence if, in\r\nimitation of France, the enemy also cased his ships of war with iron.\r\nThe solid shot gun would once again have the advantage; in fact, that\r\nvery equilibrium of relative values which M. Paixhans was endeavouring\r\nto destroy would once more obtain between the navies of the two rival\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, presumably, and because the shell gun system\r\ncontained, though in a less degree, the disability inherent in the\r\ncarronade system--inferior ranging power, enabling a clever opponent\r\narmed with long solid shot guns to fight at a range which was too great\r\nfor shell--the Paixhans scheme was not adopted in its entirety by the\r\nFrench government of the time. But the principle of unity of calibre\r\nwas acclaimed and approved almost immediately, applied to solid shot\r\nguns. The French 30-pounder was chosen as the unit. In 1829 guns of\r\nthis calibre, made on several different models to suit the various\r\ndecks and classes of ship, were mounted in their fleets.[107]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime M. Paixhans had made further progress toward perfecting\r\nthe details of his shell gun system. A _canon-obusier_ of 80 pounds\r\nwas made to his design, a chambered howitzer of the same weight\r\n(about 72 hundredweight) as the French 36-pounder truck gun and of 22\r\ncentimetres calibre. This was designed to project a hollow shell of\r\nthe same size as the French 80-pound solid shot, but weighing, when\r\nits cavity was filled with a charge of 4 pounds of powder, 56 pounds\r\nFrench (62½ pounds English). The shell gun itself was of a distinctive\r\nshape. The characteristics of short chase, large bore, a chamber, a\r\nsmall propelling charge, and a scientific elimination of all useless\r\nmetal, resulted in a form of ordnance quite different from that of the\r\nlong-accepted smooth-bore cannon. It was easily recognizable by its\r\nstraight muzzle, smooth lines and the absence of the usual ornaments\r\nand reinforcing rings. When, eventually, the New Arm was adopted by\r\nother powers, their shell guns too, though independently evolved, were\r\nfound to exhibit the same external features: the features of what came\r\nto be known universally as a “Paixhans gun.”\r\n\r\nThe terrific effect of charged shell, fired from this form of gun\r\nwith sufficient velocity to find a lodgment in a ship’s timbers, was\r\ndemonstrated at Brest in 1821 and 1824; in the latter trials the target\r\nbeing a frigate, the _Pacificateur_, moored in the roadstead. High\r\nrange and accurate shooting were obtained. The incendiary effect of\r\nthe shell was prodigious: so impressive, indeed, that in spite of a\r\nstrong opinion in the French navy against further carriage of bombs in\r\nships-of-the-line, the Commission recommended “that _canons-à-bombe_ be\r\nadopted, even in ships-of-the-line, but in small numbers.”\r\n\r\nBut though the principle of the shell gun was accepted by experts,\r\npublic opinion was not yet ready for the change. The Commission had\r\nshown a sage circumspection in regard to the extent of the change\r\nproposed; but public opinion was not yet satisfied that the new arm\r\nwas sufficiently safe. The scheme suffered a long postponement. In the\r\nmeantime several further trials were held. The design of the piece\r\nwas again modified; a larger chamber was arranged and a support was\r\ncast, at the commencement of the chase, for carrying a sight. Tests _à\r\noutrance_ were made to find what maximum charge such a shell gun would\r\nsafely stand; and at last, in 1837, the principle of shell fire was\r\naccepted by the government, the Paixhans gun being assigned a place\r\nin the prescribed armament of the fleets of France. To the impairment\r\nof the unity-of-calibre principle, lately achieved, shell guns of 22\r\ncentimetres were admitted as part-armament of ships the greater number\r\nof whose pieces were 30-pounders firing solid shot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAIXHANS GUN]\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn England the arguments in favour of a new and more scientific\r\nadjustment of ship armament had not until this date been clearly\r\nformulated. Of the tendency to a single calibre there certainly had\r\nbeen many demonstrations in the last decades of the eighteenth century:\r\na tendency favoured by the replacement of the smaller long guns of the\r\nfleet by carronades. Sir Howard Douglas, in his _Naval Gunnery_, the\r\nfirst edition of which was published in 1820, had demonstrated the\r\nadvantages of large calibre, the inefficiency of random broadsides, and\r\nthe high importance of the deliberate aim of single guns. And in 1825,\r\nbefore the French began to remodel their ordnance, Colonel Munro, of\r\nthe Royal Artillery, submitted his project to the naval authorities\r\nof arming our ships solely with 32-pounders, of different classes and\r\nweights to suit the various circumstances. But no radical revision\r\nof armament was made in the British navy until some years after the\r\nFrench had made the great stride of 1829, already described.\r\n\r\nUnity of calibre, then, was no novel idea on the part of M. Paixhans.\r\n“No project,” says Dahlgren--“no project has proved more attractive to\r\nnaval men than that of having a uniform calibre throughout the entire\r\nfleet. It has been proposed from time to time without success, until\r\nadopted for the French navy in 1829.\r\n\r\n“In the promptness with which the example was followed by England and\r\nthe United States, may be recognized the general convictions of the\r\nprofession in regard to the serious mischief inseparable from the chaos\r\nof calibres that prevailed, and the urgent necessity for some measure\r\nthat would simplify the complex economy of naval ordnance.\r\n\r\n“In a three-decker might be witnessed the extreme phase of the evil:\r\nlong 32-pounders, 18-pounders, and carronades, requiring three sizes of\r\nshot and four classes of full charge, with as many reduces as caprice\r\nmight suggest. All this variety of supply was to be distinguished and\r\nselected in the magazines and shot-lockers--circulated with perfect\r\nexactness in the confusion and obscurity of the lower passages, to\r\na particular hatchway, then up to the deck where was placed the\r\ngun for which each charge or shot was designed: and this was to be\r\naccomplished, not with the composure, deliberation, and attention\r\nthat the nature of the operation itself demanded, but amid all the\r\nexcitement and hot haste of battle.”[108]\r\n\r\nThe plans of M. Paixhans, in particular those for the adoption of shell\r\nfire on a large scale, were viewed with much misgiving in this country.\r\nBut, as already noted, Great Britain moved very cautiously in the\r\ncounter-measures which she took in view of the policy then under review\r\nin France. It is probable that the publication, in 1828, of a memoir\r\nby Captain F. A. Hastings, R.N., commanding the Greek steam vessel\r\nof war _Karteria_, had great effect in encouraging the authorities\r\nto countenance shell fire. From this memoir it appears that Captain\r\nHastings was led, by arguments similar to those which influenced M.\r\nPaixhans, to consider the possibilities of discharging at an enemy\r\nsomething more devastating in effect than the solid sphere of iron\r\nin general use. His navy was inferior in numbers to possible rivals;\r\nhe expressed the opinion that this inferiority might be nullified by\r\nthe use of shell, but he “got well laughed at for his pains.” Soon\r\nafterwards, however, he came across Paixhans’ work. Acting on his\r\nideas, he applied shell fire with great success in action, and at once\r\nbecame an enthusiastic advocate of the new arm. One great objection\r\nto its adoption he almost laid to rest: the increased danger due to\r\nthe carriage of shells. He denied that there was any increased danger.\r\nOn the contrary, he considered charged shells less dangerous than\r\npowder in cartridges, if properly packed. They were less dangerous,\r\nhe argued, because their use involved bigger and therefore fewer guns\r\nthan an ordinary ship would carry. Therefore there was less confusion\r\nin action, less jostling, more working spaces, and fewer cartridges and\r\nprojectiles to be handled. In support of his opinion he could point to\r\nan entire absence of accidents during his commission in the _Karteria_.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 a general increase of calibre was obtained by the inexpensive\r\nexpedient of boring out guns to their next larger calibre; in which\r\noperation the opportunity was taken to arrange for a reduced allowance\r\nof windage for the guns thus altered, and thus to secure a double gain,\r\nof increased calibre and improved discharge. Experiments were made\r\nwith shell fire _à la Paixhans_. Tentative designs of shell gun were\r\nproduced by the ordnance department, and guns of 8-inch, 10-inch and\r\n12-inch calibre were made; one of which, an 8-inch, mounted in H.M.S.\r\n_Phœnix_, made very effective shooting at San Sebastian in the year ’36\r\nand gave thereby an advertisement to shell fire.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 1837, came the French decision to adopt a shell gun\r\narmament generally.\r\n\r\nThe result was a complete and corresponding reorganization of British\r\nship armament.[109] By 1839, the authorities being at last convinced\r\nof the necessity of meeting the French innovations with similar\r\ninnovations on our part, Colonel Munro’s proposal of 1825 had been\r\nadopted, and various classes of ship were equipped with six different\r\npatterns of 32-pounder long gun. With these were associated, in small\r\nnumbers, 8-inch shell guns of fifty-three and sixty-five hundredweight.\r\nThus this country by a single move countered the two moves made\r\nby France in ’29 and ’37 respectively, and denied to M. Paixhans,\r\nfor a while at any rate, any considerable change in the relative\r\nstrength of the two navies. As in the French navy, shell fire was only\r\nintroduced as an auxiliary to the solid shot. Thus the great ideal\r\nof unity-of-calibre, so long sought and at last almost attained, was\r\nfound incompatible with the other ideal, shell fire; and was therefore\r\nsacrificed. No doubt was felt, at this time, as to the necessity for\r\ntwo types of gun. The superior power of shells was dreaded, suspected,\r\nhalf-acknowledged; but the superior range and penetration of solid shot\r\nfired from long guns made the latter indispensable to ships’ equipment.\r\nSo shell and large-bore shot guns were mounted in ships side by side.\r\nOld guns and carronades were “scrapped” in large numbers to give\r\nplace to the new ordnance; and an official announcement was made, in\r\njustification of the Admiralty policy, that “the changes were not made\r\nuntil they had been adopted by foreign powers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nShell fire was at last accepted. The perils associated with the\r\ncarriage of shells in wooden ships were found to have been exaggerated;\r\nexperience soon confirmed that, if special precautions were taken, no\r\ndanger was inherent in their use.\r\n\r\nEven after its introduction into our fleets the shell gun was regarded\r\nby many as of doubtful value. For some years previously the opponents\r\nof shells had agitated the question of a compromise: viz. the use of\r\nhollow shot uncharged, instead of solid balls. And when M. Paixhans\r\nhad published his great scheme they had held that more advantages\r\nwould have been offered by it if he had stopped short at charging the\r\nshot with powder, and had advocated merely hollow shot, which by their\r\nlarger size would give the advantages of heavier calibre. But the\r\nargument for hollow shot was finally demolished in 1837 by a writer\r\nwhose views carried great influence. Incorrectly attributing to M.\r\nPaixhans himself the proposal to use them, Captain Simmons, R.A. proved\r\nclearly and conclusively their comparative uselessness. The adoption\r\nof hollow shot, he showed,[110] would be tantamount to a reversion\r\nto the use of stone or granite projectiles; it mattered little, for\r\npractical purposes, what the projectile be formed of, so that its\r\ndensity be what was desired: whether hollow iron or solid granite.\r\nExcept the Turks, who still guarded the Dardanelles with granite-firing\r\ncannon, all nations had abandoned granite in favour of the heaviest\r\nmetals, and no one questioned the vast improvement thereby obtained,\r\n“except the inventors of the carronade and the promoters of this same\r\nsystem, improved by M. Paixhans.” As a matter of fact the carronade was\r\ndesigned for the special circumstances in which hollow shot were not\r\nwithout value. And M. Paixhans, as we know, never intended to forego\r\nthe use of a charge of powder in the cavity of his _boulet creux_.\r\nBut the arguments of Simmons sufficed to kill the advocacy of hollow,\r\nuncharged shot.\r\n\r\nDoubt was cast, too, on the capacity of the shell gun to project its\r\nshells to a sufficient range and with sufficient striking velocity in\r\naction. In the case of the first shell guns cast, a strict limitation\r\nhad to be placed on the powder-charges which could safely be used;\r\nand this involved a limitation of range, apart from the reduction\r\ndue to the lower specific gravity of the projectile. Both French and\r\nEnglish shell guns suffered in this respect. For this reason they had\r\nbeen deemed by the French specially suited for use in steam vessels,\r\nwhich could by their locomotive power attain the desired range. But,\r\nit was said, steam gives the power of avoiding, as well as of closing\r\nto action; and steam, it was foreseen, was a giant which would one day\r\nhaul even ships-of-the-line into position for battle. Might not future\r\nactions be fought at considerable ranges? And for close-quarter work,\r\ncould not our powerful long guns, double-shotted, be used with greater\r\neffect than shell guns?\r\n\r\nThen, again, the flight of shells was not nearly so certain as that of\r\nsolid shot. The effects of eccentricity, which in the case of solid\r\nshot had always militated against accurate shooting, were in the case\r\nof shells considerably enhanced. The varying thickness of the shell,\r\nthe lack of homogeneity of the metal, the presence of the protruding\r\nfuze, all tended to produce eccentricity and give a bias. The centre\r\nof gravity of a shell was seldom at its centre of figure; and this\r\neccentricity was the cause of deviations in flight, in range and\r\ndirection, which made the trajectory of a shell not easily predictable.\r\nSavants and artillerists, both here and in other countries, discussed\r\nfor years these deviations, and on the relationship between range and\r\neccentricity numbers of trials were made and theories were propounded.\r\nWhich is the more strange, seeing that Robins had placed on record\r\nan almost complete solution. Briefly, the effect of eccentricity may\r\nbe explained as follows. Just as a stick held vertically by a thread\r\nreceives, when struck at a point in it other than the centre of\r\npercussion, a tendency to motion not only of translation but also of\r\nrotation round that centre of percussion; so a spherical shell whose\r\ncentre of gravity lies away from its centre of figure receives, from\r\nthe pressure of the powder gases acting at its centre of figure, a\r\nrotary motion about its centre of gravity in addition to a motion along\r\nthe bore. If the centre of gravity lies below the centre of figure this\r\nrotary motion is in such a direction that, as the shell approaches the\r\nmuzzle, points on its upper surface are moving towards the muzzle,\r\npoints on the lower part are moving inwards. And this rotation,\r\nmaintained during flight, has the effect--as was demonstrated by Robins\r\nwith the musket ball--of giving the sphere a vertical deviation in a\r\ndownward direction; i.e. of reducing its range.\r\n\r\nIt follows, then, that an artificial increase of range could be\r\nobtained by placing the sphere with its centre of gravity _above_\r\nthe centre of figure? This is precisely what was done; and by many a\r\nmeasured eccentricity was considered a desideratum, as giving a higher\r\nrange than could be obtained without it. With such a system, however,\r\nthe deviations still remained large and flights still more irregular.\r\nAnd the best opinion held that the most satisfactory solution lay\r\nin reducing the errors of flight as far as possible by the use of\r\nperfectly concentric shells. This ideal was difficult of attainment.\r\nSir Howard Douglas has described at length experiments with shells\r\nthe axis of whose eccentricity was found by floating them in mercury:\r\nexperiments which revealed that not one shell in a hundred of those\r\nsupplied was perfectly balanced. For this reason misgiving was felt as\r\nto the effectiveness of shell fire when carried out at considerable\r\nranges against solid shot, and efforts were continuously made to\r\ncorrect all shell before issue.\r\n\r\nNor were the Americans inclined to view the shell gun with much favour;\r\nremembering, doubtless, what they owed to their long and powerful guns\r\nwhen they were opposed to our light guns and carronades in the war of\r\n’12 and ’13. America was more cautious even than this country. But in\r\n’41 the 8-inch shell gun appeared in American ships as an auxiliary\r\nto the long guns: four or so on each gun deck. And four years later\r\nthe types of guns in their ships were limited to 8-inch shell guns, in\r\ncombination with 32-pounder long guns of various patterns; in fact,\r\ntheir system of armament was assimilated to that of the French and\r\nBritish.\r\n\r\nWhatever the relative value of shell and solid shot might be,\r\nexperience showed that increase in size favoured the former. Though\r\nmedium-sized solid shot might be more efficient than medium-sized\r\nshells, yet it was widely accepted that large solid shot would probably\r\nbe of less value than large shell. Strong tendencies were at work,\r\nmaking for such increase in the size of artillery. It was in 1837 that\r\na writer already quoted showed the direction in which the arguments of\r\nM. Paixhans were leading. Citing Sir Howard Douglas on the advantages\r\nof large calibre and the inefficiency of random broadsides, Captain\r\nSimmons put forward the argument that, if these statements were\r\naccepted, it followed that all ships of war should be armed with a\r\nfew long guns of the maximum calibre and giving the maximum muzzle\r\nenergy which the ship could safely carry, with other guns on other\r\ndecks of the same calibre but of varying weight and range. “Instead of\r\ndetermining the armament of a ship from the length of her decks and\r\ncrowding as many guns together as possible; determining the number\r\nby the extent of the battery, and subjecting their nature to their\r\nnumber--making, in fact, the weight and type of gun depend, not on the\r\nservice demanded, but on the quotient arising from dividing the total\r\ndeck-weight by the number, previously fixed on; it might be safer to\r\nplace on board a few of the most powerful guns which her construction\r\nwould admit, and then regulate the total number carried by their\r\naggregate weight--making the _number_ and not the _nature_ of the guns\r\ndepend on what is inevitably fixed: the capacity of the vessel?”\r\n\r\nThe English writer went farther than M. Paixhans had gone. His argument\r\nforeshadowed the evolution which was so largely influenced by the\r\ncoming of the steam vessel, with its large paddle-wheels and small\r\ncrew, and with its deck space necessitating the concentration of its\r\narmament into a few guns of the largest calibre; it foreshadowed the\r\nsupersession of the broadside by the pivot gun, and the enormous\r\nexpansion in the size of ordnance which took place after the Crimean\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the shell gun was at this partial stage when the\r\nCrimean War broke out. In 1854 both types of projectiles were still\r\nstruggling for ascendancy, though large shell guns were by this time\r\nacknowledged as the superior armament for steam vessels. Both friend\r\nand foe were now literally “stormed at by shot and shell”--of which\r\nthe shell proved on the whole the more effective missile. No decisive\r\nsuperiority could be claimed, however, by one type over the other; and,\r\nas we shall see later in surveying the evolution of the ironclad, it\r\nwas only gradually that the inherent superiority of the shell gun came\r\nto be recognized.\r\n\r\nSoon after the close of the war a new step in the evolution of armament\r\nmade its supremacy decisive. The rifled cannon at last materialized.\r\nThe cylinder superseded the sphere. The increase in volume gained by\r\nthe adoption of this form of projectile, and the enhanced range and\r\nstriking velocity which it was possible to impart to it, set all doubts\r\nat rest as to the military value of the _Arme Nouvelle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _SPEAKER_, A SECOND-RATE OF THE COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\nFrom Fincham’s _Naval Architecture_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RIFLED GUN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the evolution of smooth-bore ordnance owed little if anything to\r\nthe prior development of small arms, the evolution of rifled ordnance\r\nwhich took place in the middle of the nineteenth century followed\r\nclosely on that of rifling as applied to the musket. Experience\r\nwith the rifled musket supplied the information necessary for the\r\napplication of rifling on the larger scale. In tracing the development\r\nof rifled ordnance, therefore, the development of the rifled musket\r\nmust first be considered: the two evolutions are historically linked\r\ntogether. In this chapter an endeavour is made to trace these two\r\nevolutions in their natural sequence, and to describe the circumstances\r\nin which each took place, the objects aimed at, the difficulties\r\nencountered and the results achieved. We shall see how the smooth-bore\r\nmusket was replaced by the rifle firing a spherical ball; how the\r\nspherical ball gave place, in the course of time, to an elongated\r\nbullet; and how, when the elongated bullet had been evolved, the\r\nprinciple of the rifle was extended to field and to heavy ordnance. A\r\ncomplete survey of the whole process can be obtained only by stepping\r\nback, past the days of the primitive rifled fire-arm, to the age when\r\nthe longbow was still “the surety, safeguard, and continual defence\r\nof this realm of England and an inestimable dread and terror to the\r\nenemies of the same.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe might of England, avouches the historian, stood upon archers. The\r\nprowess of the archer, the dreadful precision of the longbow, and the\r\nathletic arm by which it was strung, form the constant and animated\r\ntheme of ancient British story. In battle and the chase, we are told,\r\nthe power of the archers always prevailed, and the attainment of that\r\npower was an object of incessant anxiety, in all ranks of people,\r\nfrom their earliest infancy. The longbow was thus, as described in\r\nthe above-quoted act of Henry VIII, a continual defence of the realm.\r\nOver all other countries England had this advantage, that against the\r\nexigencies of war she had, not only her race of splendid seamen, but\r\narmies of the most skilful archers in the world. In peace she was thus\r\nwell prepared. Good use was made by legislation to maintain the skill\r\nand stimulate the ardour of the bowmen, and the statute book bears\r\nwitness, reign after reign, to the importance attached to archery from\r\nits military aspect. At one time every man between the ages of fifteen\r\nand sixty had to possess a bow equal in length to his own height. Every\r\ntownship had to maintain its butts, each saint’s day had its shooting\r\ncompetition. The churchyard yew gave its wood for staves, the geese on\r\nthe green their best wing feathers; and a goose’s head was the orthodox\r\nand inconspicuous target. No man under the age of twenty-four was\r\nallowed to shoot at any standing mark, and none over that age at any\r\nmark of eleven score yards or under. Restraint was laid on the exercise\r\nof sports which might interfere with archery, and when the mechanically\r\nstrung crossbow was introduced its use was forbidden except under\r\nspecial conditions.[111] Honours and prizes were awarded the best\r\nmarksmen. The range and accuracy achieved by them was without doubt\r\nprodigious. Much of their power lay in their strength of arm; but one\r\nof the chief secrets of their craft lay in the way in which they set\r\ntheir arrow-feathers at the requisite angle to give the arrows a spin\r\nwhich would ensure a long, a true and a steady flight.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of gunpowder the shooting competitions declined. An\r\nembargo was put on fire-arms; instead of being pressed to possess\r\nthem the people were forbidden their use except under conditions. The\r\nmilitary character became a separate order in society. Encouragement\r\nwas no longer given to the individual to own and master the unwieldy\r\nfire-arm. The English peasant, enthusiasm evaporating as his skill\r\ndeclined, no longer gave the State the military value which his\r\nforefathers possessed. The clumsy mechanism of the English musket, the\r\nuncertainty of its action (especially in wet weather), its slow rate\r\nof fire, its gross inaccuracy, and its inability to penetrate armour\r\nunder all conditions, were factors which kept fire-arms for long years\r\nin disfavour in this country.\r\n\r\nAbroad, on the other hand, the development of fire-arms was actually\r\nencouraged and skill in their use patronised. The rivalry which already\r\nexisted with bow and arrow was extended to the new medium, and in\r\nSweden and Switzerland, Germany and France, shooting competitions\r\ncontinued in vogue and proficiency with musket and arquebus was\r\nhonoured and substantially rewarded. In Switzerland and Southern\r\nGermany especially, shooting was very popular. The character of the\r\npeople, their skill in making delicate mechanisms, the nature of the\r\ncountry, all tended to promote an interest in musketry which did not\r\nexist among our own people. As a result England has little to claim in\r\nthe early stages of the development of portable fire-arms.\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries smooth-bore weapons\r\nfiring spherical lead balls were the only kind known and used. But in\r\nthe early part of the sixteenth century a development took place which\r\nwas to prove of the first importance to fire-arms; which was to make\r\nthe primitive weapon in the course of time “the most beautiful, and at\r\nthe same time the most deadly instrument of warfare ever devised by the\r\ningenuity of man.” The value of rifling was discovered.\r\n\r\nHow, when, or where this discovery was first made, appears to have\r\ndefied the researches of investigators. As to the manner in which\r\nthe development took place and the effects which it was intended to\r\nproduce by its means there is an assortment of evidence; and this is so\r\nvarious and so interesting as bearing on the action of the rifle and\r\nits evolution, that we reproduce it in some detail. On one point there\r\nappears to be small doubt: _The earliest rifling had no twist in it_.\r\n\r\n“It seems to have been generally accepted by writers on the subject,”\r\nsays the author of _The Book of the Rifle_, “that the earliest\r\nbarrels had straight grooves, the object of which was to give a space\r\ninto which the fouling of previous shots might stow itself without\r\nobstructing the process of loading with a well-fitting ball, and that\r\nspiral grooving was merely an accidental variation of this, afterwards\r\nfound to possess special advantages.” Nevertheless, he himself inclines\r\nto the opinion that the straight groove was not necessarily a prior\r\nform of the spiral. The collections in museums contain examples of\r\nspiral grooving older than the oldest straight-grooved barrels. In any\r\ncase, it is antecedently more probable, he considers, that the spiral\r\ngrooving was not a variation of the straight groove, but that it was “a\r\ndeliberate attempt to find a means of giving to the bullet the spiral\r\nspin which was well known as having a steadying effect on the javelin,\r\nor on the arrow or bolt discharged from the bow.”[112]\r\n\r\nBut in this view he is in a minority. Whereas the invention of helical\r\ngrooving is generally attributed to Augustin Kutter, a gunmaker of\r\nNuremburg who died in A.D. 1630, straight grooving had been known\r\nsince 1480, and is ascribed to one Gaspard Zöllner, a gunmaker of\r\nVienna. “Smooth-bore guns,” says Schmidt,[113] “had the disadvantage of\r\nfouling, and with the poor powder could only be recharged by leaving a\r\ncomparatively large space between the ball and the barrel. This windage\r\nprejudiced straight shooting. To overcome this deficiency the practice\r\nwas adopted of cutting grooves, more or less numerous, in the barrel,\r\nand in wrapping the ball in a rag greased with suet. In this way the\r\nwindage was reduced, and as the greased rag cleaned the barrel, the\r\nweapon could be recharged for a large number of rounds. At first these\r\ngrooves were made straight.”\r\n\r\nA theory propounded in a well-known treatise published in the year\r\n1808, entitled _Scloppetaria_, was to the effect that grooving had its\r\norigin in the habit which the early huntsman had of gnawing or biting\r\nthe balls before putting them into the piece, with a view to causing\r\nthe wound inflicted by them to be rendered more severe. This habit gave\r\nrise to the idea that the barrel itself might be made to do the work\r\nof jagging or indenting the bullet. “These grooved or sulcated barrels\r\nappear to be of great antiquity, and are said to have existed in Russia\r\nlong before their introduction among the civilized nations of the\r\nsouth.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Hans Busk, straight grooving was adopted for the reason\r\ngiven by Schmidt: i.e., purely for the purpose of facilitating loading,\r\nand for assisting to dislodge the products of combustion left in the\r\nbore. “No doubt the adoption of this plan was calculated to increase\r\nthe efficiency and accuracy of the arm from the steadiness it imparted\r\nto the bullet in its passage through the barrel.”\r\n\r\nAnd that is a view which, it is suggested, might be expanded to give a\r\nmotive or combination of motives which may well have operated to induce\r\nthe early gunmakers to cut grooves in their musket-barrels. Thus: the\r\nvariations in the flight of spherical lead balls fired from smooth-bore\r\nguns were chiefly due (though these causes were not clearly appreciated\r\ntill a much later date) to the incalculable effect of windage and to\r\nthe varying axis about which spin took place. If by any means windage\r\ncould be reduced, and if the ball could be made to assume a central\r\nposition in the bore and spin about a definite axis in its flight, a\r\nlarge increase in accuracy would be attained. Suppose, for instance, a\r\nsingle groove or gutter were filed along the barrel parallel with its\r\naxis. The effect surely would be, by creating a rush of powder-gases\r\nalong this groove, to cause the ball, under the tangential impulse of\r\nthe gases, to rotate always in the same plane as it passed through the\r\nbore. And thus by the cutting of this single groove a uniformity of\r\nflight of the ball would be attained which was unattainable without the\r\ngroove. The same effect, in fact, was produced by Robins when he bent\r\nthe musket barrel. He demonstrated that the result was to make the ball\r\nroll on a definite part of the barrel and thus to deviate during flight\r\nin a definite direction. He might have shewn, as another result of his\r\nexperiment, that by giving the ball a uniform spin he had endowed it\r\nwith a regularity of flight, or accuracy, many times greater than it\r\nbefore possessed.\r\n\r\nOr suppose that, instead of one groove, two or more grooves were filed\r\nin the same way. While the above advantage derived from the single\r\ngroove would be less fully obtained, another would result. By providing\r\na space on each side into which fouling might spread, and into which\r\nthe plastic metal of the ball might be intruded by the pressure of the\r\nramrod, their presence would certainly allow of a tight-fitting ball\r\nbeing used. The loss in efficiency of discharge due to friction between\r\nball and barrel would be more than compensated for by the annihilation\r\nof windage.[114]\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that the grooves were augmented in number until they\r\nbecame a series of triangular serrations all round the interior of\r\nthe barrel. The value of this formation might lie, not so much in the\r\ngrooves, as in the ends or points of the serrations which supported the\r\nball and held it in a central position on the true axis of the gun. In\r\nshort, the prime idea of the gunmaker may have been, not so much the\r\nprovision of grooves, as the provision of internal ribs for holding the\r\nball truly in the musket.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause or motive which led to its adoption, the rifling\r\nof musket barrels became a common practice in the sixteenth century.\r\nTwo significant quotations will suffice to show the period of the\r\ninvention. The first is an edict issued by the Swiss Government in 1563:\r\n\r\n    “For the last few years the art of cutting grooves in the\r\n    chambers of the guns has been introduced with the object of\r\n    increasing the accuracy of fire; the disadvantage resulting\r\n    therefrom to the common marksmen has sown discord among them.\r\n    In ordinary shooting matches marksmen are therefore forbidden\r\n    under a penalty of £10 to provide themselves with rifled arms.\r\n    Everyone is nevertheless permitted to rifle his military weapon\r\n    and to compete with marksmen armed with similar weapons for\r\n    special prizes.”[115]\r\n\r\nThe second is a recipe from a book by Sir Hugh Plat, written in 1594.\r\n\r\n    “How to make a pistol whose barrel is two feet in length to\r\n    deliver a bullet point blank at eight score. A pistol of the\r\n    aforesaid length and being of petronel bore, or a bore higher,\r\n    having eight gutters somewhat deep in the inside of the barrel,\r\n    and the bullet a thought bigger than the bore, and is rammed\r\n    in at the first three or four inches at the least, and after\r\n    driven down with the skowring-stick, will deliver his bullet at\r\n    such distance.”\r\n\r\nSo at some date not long after that at which straight grooving was put\r\ninto common practice, the evolution of the rifle made a further advance\r\nby the introduction of spiral grooving. This gave all the advantages\r\nof the straight grooving, and in addition, spin in a definite plane to\r\na definite degree; so that it entirely superseded straight grooving\r\nin all countries where fire-arms were in common use. Experience\r\namply confirmed the superiority of the twisted rifling. With the\r\naccession of accuracy the skill of the marksman naturally increased,\r\nenthusiasm grew, and the shooting competitions gained in popularity and\r\nimportance. “Le goût de tir des armes rayées de précision est poussé\r\njusqu’à la passion: passion qui excite l’amour-propre en ne laissant\r\npas à la maladresse l’excuse si facile de l’imperfection inévitable de\r\nl’arme à canon lisse.”[116]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULLET MOULD]\r\n\r\nYet in spite of improvements the rifled musket remained unrecognized\r\nas a military weapon for another two hundred years. Its use was\r\nconfined to sporting purposes; though far less in common use than the\r\nsmooth-bore it became, for its increased accuracy, the favourite weapon\r\nof the deer-stalker and the chamois hunter. In England it was little\r\nknown before the nineteenth century; and when, in 1746, Robins made his\r\nfamous prophecy, the possibilities inherent in rifled fire-arms, even\r\nsuch as were then in existence, were unrealized by the people of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that it was only in increased accuracy of flight that\r\nthe rifled gun had a superiority over the smooth-bore; no increase in\r\nranging power was possessed by it. And yet this claim is constantly\r\nmade by old writers, that, probably (as they say) owing to the fact\r\nthat increased resistance of the ball to initial motion gave time for\r\nall the charge to be thoroughly ignited, the rifled gun carried further\r\nthan the smooth-bore. As a fact, the contrary was true; other things\r\nbeing equal, the range of the rifle was actually less than that of the\r\nsmooth-bore. The explanation of the paradox was given by Robins. “It is\r\nnot surprising,” he said, “that those habituated to the use of rifled\r\npieces gave way to prepossessions like these; for they found that with\r\nthem they could fire at a mark with tolerable success, though it were\r\nplaced at three or four times the distance to which the ordinary pieces\r\nwere supposed to reach: and therefore as they were ignorant of the true\r\ncause of this variation ... it was not unnatural for them to imagine,\r\nthat the superiority in the effect of rifled pieces was owing either to\r\na more violent impulse at first, or to a more easy passage through the\r\nair.” The true value of the spiral grooving resided, of course, in the\r\nspinning motion which it gave the ball. By making this spin uniform two\r\nvariable factors determining the trajectory were thereby transformed\r\ninto constants: first, the effect just mentioned, the influence of the\r\nvarying resistance of the air on the parts of the ball which met it at\r\ndifferent speeds, some parts moving forward relatively to its centre\r\nand some parts retreating; secondly, the effect of eccentricity of mass\r\nand irregularity of exterior surface, which were both almost nullified\r\nby the rotation. The importance of this second effect may not at first\r\nsight be apparent. It must be remembered, however, that the balls used\r\nin those days were of the roughest description; cast in hand moulds,\r\n“drawn” in cooling to such an extent that in a large proportion an\r\nactual cavity was left in their interior, which could be revealed only\r\nby cutting them open; their burrs removed with pincers, their surface\r\nrough and broken, their shape distorted by the ramrod’s blows.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the rifle in accuracy was generally admitted; and\r\nthis advantage not only counterbalanced such deficiency in ranging\r\npower as may have accrued from the use of grooving, but actually led\r\nto a general but mistaken belief that the rifle carried farther than\r\nthe smooth-bore. The reverse was the case. Moreover, it was not safe to\r\nuse with a rifle the very large charges of powder which could be used\r\nwith safety with a smooth-bore musket. On account of the resistance to\r\nmotion of the ball which had been forced by ramrod, sometimes even by\r\nmallet, down the grooved barrel of the rifle, high chamber pressures\r\nresulted, and not infrequently the barrels burst. Hence in spite of the\r\nthicker metal of which they were generally made, rifles could only be\r\nused with moderate charges, and so could not compete on equal terms, in\r\nthis respect, with the smooth-bores for superiority of range.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the eighteenth century events occurred which drew\r\nattention to the utility of the rifle for military purposes. In spite\r\nof its slow rate of fire--to load it carefully took from one and a\r\nhalf to two minutes--it showed itself to be a very effective weapon\r\nin the hands of French tirailleurs, Swiss, Austrian, and Tyrolese\r\n_Jägers_, Hottentots and American Indians. In the War of Independence\r\nthe superior accuracy of their rifles, and their capacity for hitting\r\nat ranges beyond the 200 yards which were about the limit of the\r\nsmooth-bore musket, placed the American backwoodsmen at such an\r\nadvantage over the British troops that riflemen were recruited on the\r\nContinent and sent across the Atlantic to counter them. New military\r\ntactics came into vogue at this time, their inception influenced by the\r\ngradual improvement in fire-arms and artillery. Bodies of riflemen,\r\n“a light erratic force concealing itself with facility and forming an\r\nambuscade at will,” were formed in the continental armies to act in\r\nconcert with the masses of infantry as skirmishers or sharp-shooters,\r\ntheir object being to surprise and demoralize the enemy by the accuracy\r\nof their long-range shooting. Rifles were now looked on, too, as the\r\nnatural counterpart of the now flying or horse artillery, “which,\r\nfrom the rapidity of its motions, the execution of cannon-shot in all\r\nsituations, appears to be the effects of little less than magic.”[117]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIFLEMAN PRESENTING\r\n\r\n(From Ezekiel Baker’s _Rifled Guns_, A.D. 1813.)]\r\n\r\nIn 1800 a rifle corps was raised by the British government from the old\r\n95th Regiment. As the result of competitive trials the rifle made by\r\nEzekiel Baker, a gunmaker of Whitechapel, was adopted: taking spherical\r\nballs of twenty to the pound, and having a barrel 30 inches long,\r\nrifled with two grooves twisted one-quarter of a turn. This degree of\r\ntwist was certainly much less than that used in French, German and\r\nAmerican rifles, which as a rule had three-quarters or a whole turn in\r\nthem; but Baker found that so great a twist caused stripping of the\r\nballs; so, as the accuracy of the lower twist was as great as that of\r\nthe higher up to a range of 300 yards, and as it required a relatively\r\nsmaller charge, gave smaller chamber pressures and caused less fouling\r\nof the barrel than its competitors, it was accepted. There was a strong\r\nopinion at the time in favour of the larger twist as universally used\r\nby the more expert foreign marksmen; and this opinion was justified by\r\nexperience.[118] The quarter-turn twist might give sufficient accuracy\r\nat low ranges, but as the skill of the riflemen increased longer ranges\r\nwere attempted; and then it was found that sufficient accuracy was\r\nunattainable with the approved weapon. Rifles having a larger twist\r\nwere therefore made by rival gunmakers and, the results of shooting\r\nmatches giving incontestable evidence of their superiority, a demand\r\narose for their supply to the army riflemen. Accordingly in 1839 the\r\nBrunswick rifle was adopted for the British army. The new weapon had\r\ntwo deep grooves twisted a whole turn in the length of the barrel,\r\nin which grooves studs, cast on the ball and designed to prevent\r\nstripping, were made to engage.\r\n\r\nThis was the last stage of the evolution of the rifle firing a\r\nspherical ball. So long as the spherical ball was retained, spiral\r\ngrooving offered relatively small advantages over straight grooving;\r\nstraight grooving offered small advantages over the best smooth-bore\r\nmuskets. The tedious loading of these rifles and the inefficiency of\r\nthe system by which windage was eliminated by the force of ramming, are\r\nsufficiently set forth by the various writers on early fire arms; and\r\nthere is small wonder that the value of rifles as military weapons was\r\nseriously questioned by the highest professional opinion of the time.\r\nThe charge of powder had to be carefully varied according to the state\r\nof the weather and the foulness of the piece. Care had to be taken\r\nthat all the grains of the charge poured into it went to the breech\r\nend and did not stick to the sides of the barrel. Patches of leather\r\nor fustian were carried, in which the ball was wrapped on loading, to\r\nabsorb windage, lubricate the rifling, and prevent the “leading” of\r\nthe barrel and the wear which would ensue if a naked ball were used.\r\n“Place the ball,” says Ezekiel Baker, “upon the greased patch with the\r\nneck or castable, where it is cut off from the moulds, downwards, as\r\ngenerally there is a small hole or cavity in it, which would gather\r\nthe air in its flight.” The ball, a good tight fit, had to be rammed,\r\nin its surrounding patch, right down to the powder: for, if not rammed\r\nproperly home, an air-space would be left and the barrel would perhaps\r\nburst on discharge; at the least, would give an inaccurate flight to\r\nthe ball. If the barrel were at all worn, double or treble patches were\r\nnecessary. To loosen the filth which collected in the barrel, and which\r\nsometimes prevented the ball from being either rammed or withdrawn,\r\nwater had to be poured down; not infrequently urine was used.\r\n\r\nAll sizes and shapes of groove were given to the early rifle, and\r\ntheir number depended largely upon caprice or superstition. Seven,\r\nfor instance, was a number frequently chosen on account of its mystic\r\nproperties; in _Scloppetaria_ an attempt is made to prove that an\r\nodd number has an advantage over an even. So, also, various degrees\r\nof twist were used. But in respect of this the evolution followed a\r\ndefinite course. The pitch of the twist necessarily bore a certain\r\nrelationship to muzzle velocity. With the earliest rifles a fairly\r\nrapid twist was given, being rendered possible by the small muzzle\r\nvelocities employed, and indeed being rendered necessary to ensure\r\nstability to the flight of the ball. Then, with the endeavours made, at\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century, to use higher charges and thereby\r\nto extend their range, higher muzzle velocities came into use, and the\r\ndanger of stripping was then only prevented by the use of low twists.\r\nSpecial devices enabled a return to be made, in the Brunswick and other\r\npatterns, to the more rapid twists originally used.\r\n\r\nWhatever devices were adopted to prevent stripping, however perfect\r\nthe design and material of the equipment employed, two factors stood\r\nin the way of any further advance in the evolution of the rifle firing\r\nthe spherical ball. First, the unsuitability of the sphere itself\r\nfor projection through a resisting medium, by reason of the large\r\nsurface which it offered to the air’s resistance and the relatively\r\nsmall mass by means of which it could maintain its flight. Second, the\r\ngyroscopic action of the spinning sphere, which limited its effective\r\nrange in a manner which was probably unrealized until after it had\r\nbeen completely superseded. The sphere, unlike the elongated bullet,\r\nwhich always keeps its axis approximately tangential to its trajectory,\r\nmaintained throughout flight its spin on its original axis. This did\r\nnot matter much when ranges were short and trajectories flat; but as\r\ngreater ranges and loftier trajectories came into use the effect on\r\naccuracy of aim became very important. During its descent through the\r\nlatter part of the trajectory the rifle ball rotated in a plane no\r\nlonger normal to its direction of flight; “it tended more and more to\r\nroll upon the air, and deviated considerably.”[119]\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe old Brown Bess, the ¾-inch smooth-bore musket which our armies\r\ncarried at Waterloo, in the Peninsula, and even at the Crimea,\r\ndiffered in no great respect from the muskets borne by British troops\r\nat Ramillies, whose inefficiency was such that it was seriously\r\nquestioned whether, without the invention of the bayonet, they would\r\nhave permanently superseded the crossbow of the Middle Ages. The\r\ninefficiency of Brown Bess was indeed remarkable. Its standard of\r\naccuracy was so low that a trained marksman could only depend on\r\nputting one shot in twenty into an eighteen-foot square target at two\r\nhundred yards, at which range it was supposed to be effective. Its\r\nwindage was so great that bullets flew wild from the muzzle; and it\r\nis not very surprising that, armed with such a weapon, our infantry\r\nshould often have been impelled “to resort to the strong and certain\r\nthrust of the bayonet, rather than rely for their safety on the chance\r\nperformances of the clumsy and capricious Brown Bess.” Writers on\r\nfire-arms are able to give dozens of tragic and laughable instances\r\nof its erratic shooting. In the Kaffir war, for example, our troops\r\nhad to expend no fewer than eighty thousand rounds to kill or cripple\r\nsome twenty-five naked savages. After Waterloo a musket was sent down\r\nto Woolwich, to ascertain whether its ball would penetrate a French\r\ncuirass at two hundred yards’ range. The cuirass was mounted on a\r\npole, the musket aligned and held firmly in a vice; but it was found\r\nimpossible to secure a hit until, at last, a random shot fired by one\r\nof the officers present did take effect! Nevertheless, Brown Bess\r\nremained in favour for a number of years after Waterloo. It had a flat\r\nand raking trajectory, owing to the very high muzzle velocity imparted\r\nto it by the large charge of powder used; from its great windage it\r\nloaded easily; and, although rather too heavy for long marches, it was\r\nstrong enough to bear any amount of hard usage.[120]\r\n\r\nSo long as the rifle used a spherical ball it could not claim to rival\r\nBrown Bess for general service. As soon as the elongated projectile\r\nwas developed the supersession of the smooth-bore was a matter of\r\ntime alone. It is strange, however, in view of the enthusiasm of the\r\nVictorian rifleman and the ease with which the fire-arm lent itself\r\nto novel experiments, that the evolution of the elongated projectile\r\ncovered so long a period as it did.\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that cylindrical bars and shot had often been fired\r\nfrom ordnance, it was known that Benjamin Robins himself had tried the\r\nexperiment of firing egg-shaped projectiles from a rifle with a certain\r\namount of success. The inefficiency of the loose sphere, in the case\r\nof the smooth-bore, and of the tightly rammed sphere, in the case of\r\nthe rifle, were both recognized in the early days of the century. And,\r\nwhile no solution could be found, the problem was generally agreed to\r\nbe: how to drop the projectile loosely down the barrel, and tighten it\r\nso as to absorb the windage when already there.\r\n\r\nTwo or three English inventors made proposals. In 1823 a Captain\r\nNorton, of the 34th Regiment, submitted an elongated projectile with\r\na base hollowed out in such a way as to expand automatically when the\r\npressure of the powder-gas came on it, and thus seal the bore. The\r\nidea came to him from an examination of the arrow used by the natives\r\nof Southern India with their blow-tube: an examination which revealed\r\nthat the base of the arrow was formed of elastic lotus-pith, which by\r\nits expansion against the cylindrical surface of the tube prevented the\r\nescape of air past it. In 1836 Mr. Greener submitted a pointed bullet\r\nhaving a cylindrical cavity in its base in which a conical plug was\r\nfixed, expanding the base by a wedging action when under the pressure\r\nof the powder gases.[121] Had either of these ideas been considered\r\nwith the attention which it deserved, the development of the rifle\r\nin this country might have been more rapid than it was. “By blindly\r\nrejecting both of these inventions the authorities deprived England of\r\nthe honour of having initiated the greatest improvement in small arms.”\r\n\r\nIt was in France that the elongated projectile waged an eventually\r\nsuccessful struggle against the spherical ball, its ancient rival.\r\nThe French, troubled by the superiority of their Arab enemies in\r\nshooting at long range, founded a School of Musketry at Vincennes. In\r\n1828 Captain Delvigne, a distinguished staff officer of that school,\r\nestablished the two main principles on which all succeeding inventors\r\nwere obliged to rely: one, that in muzzle-loading rifles the projectile\r\nmust slip down the barrel with a certain windage, so as to admit of\r\neasy loading; two, that only elongated projectiles were suited to\r\nmodern rifles.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to these two conclusions Delvigne had made important\r\nefforts to render the spherical ball as efficient as possible. He\r\nhad, in particular, proposed to make that part of the barrel near the\r\nbreech which formed the powder-chamber of slightly smaller diameter\r\nthan the rest of the barrel; so that a spherical ball, rammed down\r\non it, became indented against its ledge and flattened sufficiently\r\nto fill the rifling grooves. By this device quick loading was\r\nobtained and the accuracy of aim, it was found, was doubled. Certain\r\npractical disadvantages, however, were associated with it: the chamber\r\nfouled rapidly, and the ball was frequently distorted and jagged\r\nby over-ramming. So in ’33 the Delvigne system, as it was called,\r\nwas modified by the wrapping of the ball in a greased patch and the\r\nattaching of the patch to a “sabot” or wad of wood which was interposed\r\nbetween the ball and the shoulders of the powder-chamber. Rifles thus\r\nloaded did good work in Algeria in ’38.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Delvigne, admittedly inspired by the writings of\r\nRobins, was urging on the authorities the superiority of the elongated\r\nball. He was insistent on the advantages which would accrue from\r\naugmenting the mass of the projectile while at the same time making\r\nit present to the air during flight its smallest surface. The shape\r\nhe proposed was that of the present-day rifle bullet, considerably\r\nshortened: a bullet with a flat base, cylindrical sides and ogival\r\nhead, somewhat resembling the form which had been proposed by Sir\r\nIsaac Newton as a “solid of least resistance.” After a succession of\r\ndisappointments and refusals, the inventor had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing his bullet accepted. Its advantages over the spherical ball\r\nhad been made manifest on the proving-ground. It was accepted in\r\ncombination with the _carabine à tige_, a rifle invented by a Colonel\r\nThouvenin, in which the Delvigne shouldered chamber was replaced by a\r\nsmall central pillar or anvil, projecting from the breech-end of the\r\nbore, against which the bullet was rammed. The powder, when poured into\r\nthe barrel, collected in the annular space around the pillar. By this\r\narrangement the necessity for the sabot was obviated and the charge of\r\npowder, protected by the pillar, was not in danger of being crushed\r\nor mealed. In ’46 the new bullet proved its high accuracy and ranging\r\npower on active service in Algeria. But the pillar was found liable to\r\nbend and distort; and the difficulty in keeping the space round it free\r\nfrom fouling proved to be another of its inherent disadvantages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “CARABINE À TIGE”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINIÉ BULLET]\r\n\r\nAnd then, in 49 the Minié compound bullet, self-expanding, of the same\r\nshape as the Delvigne and utilizing the same principle of an expansive\r\nbore as that embodied in Greener’s bullet, was produced. The full value\r\nof the rifle was at last obtained. By virtue of the elongated bullet\r\nthe mass of the projectile could be increased to a large extent without\r\nany increase in the cross-sectional area exposed to air resistance.\r\nWith such a projectile, impelled by a charge whose combustive effect\r\ncould be accurately gauged owing to the absence of all windage losses,\r\ngreat speed and accuracy were possible. As to power, the only limit\r\nimposed was the strength of the barrel and the capacity of the marksman\r\nto withstand the reactionary blow due to the projectile’s momentum.\r\nBut now, not only was rifling advantageous: with the elongated bullet\r\nrifling was an absolute necessity. “Rotation,” it was said, “is the\r\nsoul of the bullet.” Rotation was necessary to impart stability, and to\r\nkeep the projectile, by virtue of the initial spin acquired, true in\r\nits flight throughout the whole trajectory.\r\n\r\nIn England, where the two-grooved Brunswick still marked the limit\r\nof development, the discovery of the Minié weapon and its powers\r\noccasioned misgiving and surprise.[122] In ’51 some Minié rifles were\r\npurchased and issued, as a temporary expedient, to our army. And,\r\ninterest in the question now becoming general,[123] it was resolved\r\nto take under government control the future manufacture of military\r\nsmall arms. A commission of officers visited America for the purpose\r\nof inspecting the ingenious tools and appliances known to be employed\r\nthere in the manufacture of rifles; and the features of the various\r\nEuropean and American weapons were seriously studied. A government\r\nfactory was established at Enfield, and with the products of this\r\nfactory certain of our regiments were armed for service when the\r\nCrimean War broke out. The Enfield rifle, as it was called, combined\r\nthe best features of the Minié with those of other types. It had a\r\nthree-grooved barrel with a half-turn twist in its length of 39 inches.\r\nIt was .577 inch in the bore, and fired a bullet whose recessed base\r\nwas filled with a boxwood instead of an iron cup or plug.\r\n\r\nThe nation soon obtained value from the new development. The efficiency\r\nof the Enfield rifle at the Alma and at Inkerman was attested by the\r\ncorrespondent of _The Times_, who reported that “it smote the enemy\r\nlike a destroying angel.” Three years later the Indian Mutiny afforded\r\na still more conclusive proof of the value of this weapon. Though,\r\nfrom the greased cartridges which were used, it served as one of the\r\npretexts for the mutiny, it proved in the sequel a powerful military\r\ninstrument, and demonstrated both to friend and foe its superiority\r\nover the smooth-bore musket with which the rebels were armed. In\r\nfact, with the adoption of the Enfield rifle, England found herself\r\nin advance even of France; the French, partly perhaps from motives\r\nof economy, partly from a desire for symmetry, had retained in their\r\nMinié rifle the same calibre as that of their old smooth-bore: indeed,\r\nthe greater part of the French army rifles were merely converted\r\nsmooth-bores. In the Enfield a wise reduction of calibre had been\r\nmade; whereby, while the weight of the rifle was reduced, its strength\r\nand the size of the permissible charges, and therefore the range and\r\npenetrating power of the projectile were all considerably augmented.\r\n\r\nHaving once gained the lead, England now took another rapid move\r\nforward in the development of the rifle. Though the new standards set\r\nby the Enfield were high, expert opinion aimed at something still\r\nhigher; the Enfield gave variations in range and direction which could\r\nnot be accounted for by errors in manufacture, nor did the range and\r\npenetrative power of the bullet come up to expectations. In these\r\ncircumstances the government sought the advice of a man whose name was\r\ndestined to loom large in the story of the subsequent development of\r\nordnance: Mr. Whitworth. Mr. Whitworth was described as the greatest\r\nmechanical genius in Europe at that time. Certain it is that, although\r\nin the realm of ordnance his name may have been overshadowed to a\r\ncertain extent by that of his great rival, yet on the broad ground of\r\nthe influence his inventions exerted on the progress of mechanical\r\nscience generally, his fame now grows with time. He it was who first\r\nswept away the medieval conception of measurement which hitherto had\r\nobtained in factories and workshops, and introduced a scientific\r\nprecision into the manufacture of machines and mechanisms. The true\r\nplane surface, as we know it to-day, was unattained before his time;\r\nand his contemporaries marvelled at plates of metal prepared by him of\r\nso true a surface that, by their mere adhesion, one could be lifted by\r\nmeans of the other. The micrometer was a similar revelation. Men whose\r\nminimum of size had hitherto been the thickness of a chalk-line or a\r\nsimple fraction of an inch, were taught by him to measure the inch\r\nto its ten-thousandth part, and even to gauge the expansion of a rod\r\ncaused by the warmth imparted by the contact of a finger.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who made modern artillery possible. To Mr. Whitworth,\r\nwho knew nothing himself of guns or of gun-making, the government went\r\nfor advice on the shortcomings of the Enfield rifle. At their request\r\nhe promptly began an analytical inquiry into the principles underlying\r\nthe action of rifles and the flight of their projectiles, resolved\r\nand urged to discover the secret of the very partial success so far\r\nattained. The results of this inquiry, published in ’57, had a great\r\ninfluence on the future of rifled fire-arms and ordnance. Briefly, he\r\ndiscovered that the amount of twist hitherto given to the rifling of\r\ngun-barrels had been wholly insufficient to maintain the projectile\r\nin its true direction during flight; the weight of the projectile,\r\nrelatively to its diameter, had been insufficient to give it the\r\nnecessary momentum to sustain its velocity against the resistance\r\nof the air; lastly, the accuracy of manufacture of rifles had been\r\ninadequate to the ensuring of a good fit of the bullet in the bore. To\r\nprove the truth of these assertions a Whitworth rifle was produced by\r\nhim which gave better results than any other hitherto made. The form\r\nof rifling which the inventor adopted was considered objectionable,\r\nand the rifle itself, with its polygonal barrel, was not approved by\r\nthe authorities; but, instead, the valuable results of Whitworth’s\r\nexperiments were embodied in the Enfield, to its obvious improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITWORTH RIFLE BULLET]\r\n\r\nThe muzzle-loading rifle had now reached the limit of its development.\r\nThe rifle was the accepted arm of all the great military powers. But\r\nin the case of one of them, Prussia, the principle of breech-loading\r\nwas already in favour, and it was not long before the progress in\r\nmechanical science enabled this principle to prove its superiority\r\nover the ancient principle of muzzle-loading. Although in the Prussian\r\nneedle-gun great difficulties were encountered; although in service its\r\nreputation suffered from such defects as the rusting of the needles\r\nwhich pierced the percussion cartridges, the failure of springs, the\r\nescape of gases at the breech; yet it was recognized that none of these\r\ndefects was necessarily inherent in the breech-loading system, and its\r\nmerits were admitted. With the breech-loader a greater rapidity of fire\r\nwas always attainable, there was less difficulty in preventing fouling,\r\nand, above all, there was the certainty that the powder-charge would be\r\nfired to its last effective grain.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 breech-loading rifles were recommended for the British army,\r\nand shortly afterwards they were introduced in the form of converted\r\nEnfields.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the development of field ordnance stimulated the\r\ndevelopment of the rifle. In turn the attainment of superior range\r\nand accuracy by rifled small arms led directly to a corresponding\r\ndevelopment of field ordnance, designed to recover the loss of its\r\nascendancy. In France, where the logical consequences of the progress\r\nin small arms were officially noted on several occasions, Napoleon\r\nIII, himself an authority on artillery, took the initiative to restore\r\nfield ordnance to its former relative position. It was in the Crimean\r\nWar that the enhanced effects of rifle regiments were first seriously\r\nfelt. Convinced by the protraction of the operations before Sebastopol\r\nof the inadequacy of smooth-bore guns, the Emperor caused bronze pieces\r\nto be rifled, and these, being sent to Algeria on active service, gave\r\nconclusive proof of their increased efficiency. On report of which, all\r\nthe bronze field pieces in the French army were rifled in accordance\r\nwith the plans which a M. Treuille de Beaulieu had submitted in 1842,\r\nviz. with six shallow rounded grooves in which engaged zinc studs\r\ncarried on two bands formed on the cylindrical projectile. The gain in\r\npower obtained by rifling ordnance was greater even than that obtained\r\nfrom rifling as applied to small arms. For not only did rifling confer\r\nthe advantages of a more massive projectile more suitably shaped for\r\nflight through a resisting medium, but it allowed a large increase\r\nin the number of balls which could be discharged in the form of case\r\nor shrapnel, and a large increase in the powder-charge which could\r\nbe carried inside a common shell. An advantage was also gained in\r\nrespect of that important detail, the fusee or fuze; the rotation of\r\nthe projectile about a definite axis made it possible to use fuses\r\nwhose action depended on one definite part of the projectile coming\r\nfirst in contact with the ground or target.[124] All these advantages\r\nwere found to be present in the French field pieces when rifled on the\r\nabove plan. “And thus,” said an English writer, “at slight expense\r\nbut too late for use in the Crimean War, France was put in possession\r\nof an artillery which, consuming its usual powder and using either\r\nround ball or elongated projectiles, proved of immense value in the war\r\nagainst Austria in 1856, when, at Magenta and at Solferino, the case\r\nshot from their rifled field-pieces ploughed through the distant masses\r\nof opposing infantry and decimated the cavalry as they formed for the\r\nattack.”[125]\r\n\r\nIn England an almost simultaneous development took place, but on\r\nentirely different lines. Let us tell it in the words of Sir Emerson\r\nTennant:\r\n\r\n“The fate of the battle of Inkerman in November, 1854, was decided\r\nby two eighteen-pounder guns which by almost superhuman efforts were\r\ngot up late into the field, and these, by their superior range, were\r\neffectual in silencing the Russian fire. Mr. William Armstrong was\r\namongst those who perceived that another such emergency could only be\r\nmet by imparting to field-guns the accuracy and range of the rifle; and\r\nthat the impediment of weight must be removed by substituting forged\r\ninstead of cast-iron guns. With his earliest design for the realization\r\nof this conception, he waited on the Secretary for War in December,\r\n1854, to propose the enlargement of the rifle musket to the standard of\r\na field gun, and to substitute elongated projectiles of lead instead\r\nof balls of cast iron. Encouraged by the Duke of Newcastle, he put\r\ntogether his first wrought-iron gun in the spring of 1855.”[126]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of this gun marked a new era in ordnance. Repeated\r\ntrials followed its completion; with the result that in 1858 the\r\nArmstrong gun was officially adopted for service in the field,--the\r\nepoch-making Armstrong gun: a tube made of wrought-iron bar coiled in\r\na closed helix and welded at a white heat into a solid mass; turned\r\nto a true cylinder and reinforced by outer tubes shrunk on to it;\r\nrifled with a large number of grooves; breech-loading, a powerful screw\r\nholding a sliding vent-piece tightly against the face of the breech;\r\nfiring a lead-coated projectile in whose plastic covering the rifling\r\nengaged as soon as it started its passage through the bore; and mounted\r\non a field-carriage in such a way that the gun could recoil up an\r\ninclined slide and return by gravity, and in such a way that its motion\r\nboth for elevating and for traversing was under the accurate control\r\ngiven by screw gearing.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Armstrong gun at once revolutionized artillery\r\npractice and material in this country. The sum of all the improvements\r\nembodied in it was so great that existing material scarcely bore\r\ncomparison with it. Its accuracy as compared with that of the\r\nsmooth-bore field piece which it displaced was stated in parliament to\r\nbe in the ratio of fifty-seven to one. And the effect of its inventor’s\r\nachievement was, “that from being the rudest of weapons, artillery has\r\nbeen advanced to be nearly on a par mechanically with the steam engine\r\nor the power-loom; and it differs as essentially from the old cast-iron\r\ntube dignified with the name of a gun, as the railway train of the\r\npresent day differs from the stagecoach of our forefathers.”[127] A\r\nrevolutionary invention it certainly was. Yet, like most revolutionary\r\ninventions, it relied for its grand effect more on the aggregate\r\neffect of the small improvements in its various elements than on the\r\nmaterialization of some new-born idea. The building up of guns in coils\r\nwas not a new discovery, polygroove rifling was already in use abroad,\r\nbreech-loading, lead-coated projectiles, elevating screws--all had\r\nbeen known for years. Nor does this fact detract in the least from the\r\nfame of Mr. Armstrong in this connection. His greatness lay, surely,\r\nin the insight and initiative with which he made use of known forms\r\nand combinations, summoning to his aid the new powers placed at his\r\ndisposal by Whitworth, Nasmyth, Bessemer and their contemporaries in\r\norder to evolve a system incomparably superior to anything hitherto\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nIn England, too, an independent development was at the same time taking\r\nplace in yet another direction. Mr. Whitworth, having satisfactorily\r\nestablished the principles governing the design of rifles, felt\r\nconfident of extending them to field and heavy ordnance. Adhering to\r\nthe muzzle-loading principle and to his hexagonal form of rifling he\r\nmanufactured, between the years 1854 and 1857, several guns which\r\nfired projectiles of from six to twenty-four pounds’ weight with\r\ngreat accuracy and to ranges greater than any yet attained. Events\r\noccurred which caused him to be given every encouragement by the\r\ngovernment. The attitude of the French in these years was suspicious\r\nand unfriendly. Schemes of invasion were openly discussed in their\r\npress, and war vessels of various types equipped with armour plate\r\nwere designed and actually built. Reports of their plans, following\r\nclosely on the exposures of the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny,\r\nrendered the country increasingly restless and apprehensive as to the\r\nvalue of our offensive and defensive armaments. And then, although the\r\nnew Armstrong gun was acclaimed as eminently suited for service in the\r\nfield, doubts had been cast as to whether the principles of its design\r\ncould be applied satisfactorily to the heaviest ordnance. Other rifled\r\nartillery had certainly failed to give the results expected from it.\r\nThe Lancaster rifled gun, a muzzle-loading gun with a twisted bore of\r\na slightly oval section, had failed lamentably at the Crimea owing\r\nto the tendency, according to one account, of the oval projectile to\r\nwedge itself against the slightly larger oval of the bore; according to\r\nanother account, owing to the flames from the powder gases penetrating\r\nthe interior of the welded shells which had been supplied for it. The\r\nbreech-loading ordnance of Cavalli had failed the Italians. In Sweden\r\nseveral accidents had occurred with Wahrendorf’s breech-loading pieces.\r\nThe French system, which had been copied by the majority of the powers,\r\nwas that which appeared to be giving the least unsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances every encouragement was given Mr. Whitworth to\r\ndevelop ordnance on his own lines. In ’58 a committee on rifled guns\r\nwas appointed by parliament to examine and report on the relative\r\nmerits of the various systems in use. The committee quickly set to\r\nwork. No difficulty was found in eliminating all but two, on which\r\nattention was soon concentrated: the Armstrong and the Whitworth.\r\nThe result of the final investigation was a report in favour of the\r\nArmstrong gun, which, as we have already seen, was adopted in the same\r\nyear for field service. Mr. Armstrong, who had handed over his rights\r\nin the gun for the benefit of the nation, was knighted and his services\r\nwere subsidized for the improvement of rifled ordnance generally. The\r\ntitle of “Engineer to the War Department” was conferred on him, and\r\nlater he received the further appointment of “Superintendent of the\r\nRoyal Gun Factory” at Woolwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe revolution in field guns was closely followed by a corresponding\r\nrevolution in heavy ordnance. The experience of the Crimean War proved\r\ntwo things: that the development of the shell gun necessitated the\r\nprovision of armour to protect the flanks of warships; and that the\r\ndevelopment of armour necessitated a heavy ordnance of a greater power\r\nthan existing smooth-bore cannon. The shell gun, in fact, induced a\r\nrifled ordnance.\r\n\r\nThe French, who had already found a cheap and sufficiently effective\r\nrifled field artillery in the conversion of their smooth-bores on the\r\nde Beaulieu principle, merely had to extend this conversion to their\r\nheavier pieces. By 1860 they had converted their 30- and 50-pounder\r\ncannon in this way, thus enabling them to be used for the discharge of\r\neither spherical or elongated projectiles.\r\n\r\nBritain, on the other hand, found herself committed to an entirely\r\nnew and experimental system which could not be applied to existing\r\nordnance; a large outlay of money was thereby involved for new plant\r\nand guns; our vast establishment of smooth-bore cast-iron cannon was\r\nin danger of being reduced to scrap material. At the same time doubts\r\nwere expressed whether this new system, whose success as applied to\r\nmedium pieces was generally admitted, would be found satisfactory\r\nwhen applied to the largest size of ordnance. It was natural, then,\r\nthat great interest should be centred in what was regarded as a less\r\nexperimental alternative to the Armstrong system, in case the latter\r\nfailed. The results obtained by Mr. Whitworth in the manufacture\r\nof solid cannon, rifled hexagonally, muzzle-loading and capable of\r\nfiring hexagonal bolts or, in emergency, spherical balls, were such\r\nas to give promise of competing successfully with those obtained from\r\nthe ordnance officially patronized. To the public the simplicity of\r\nhis system strongly appealed. Mr. Whitworth himself, far from being\r\ndeterred by the decision given in favour of his rival, was now an\r\nenthusiastic exponent of the constructive principles which he had\r\nmade his own. Trial succeeded trial, piece after piece was made and\r\ntested to destruction. By 1860 a very successful ordnance was evolved\r\nat Manchester by him: guns made of homogeneous iron, forged in large\r\nmasses, and formed of cylindrical tubes forced one over another by\r\nmeans of a known hydraulic pressure--not, as in the Armstrong system,\r\nby heating and shrinking. And on the sands at Southport a series of\r\npublic trials were carried out with these guns, the results of which\r\nproved a great advertisement for the Whitworth system. The accuracy of\r\nflight of the projectiles was unprecedented, and all records in ranging\r\npower were broken by one of the pieces, a 3-pounder, which threw a shot\r\nto a distance of 9,688 yards![128]\r\n\r\nEven if the new Whitworth system were adopted, the utilization of the\r\nold smooth-bore cannon which formed the existing national armament\r\nof ships and fortresses was not secured. Neither the Armstrong nor\r\nthe Whitworth system provided an expedient for converting to rifled\r\nordnance the thousands of cast-iron guns in which the defence of the\r\ncountry was invested. Efforts were therefore made to reinforce the\r\nold pieces so that, when rifled, they would be sufficiently strong to\r\nwithstand the greater stresses entailed. Greater stresses in the metal,\r\ndue to higher chamber pressures of the powder gases, were almost a\r\nnecessary concomitant of rifling. For, apart from the increase in the\r\nsize and mass of the projectile and its greater initial resistance\r\nto motion, pressures tended to increase in a greater ratio than the\r\nsize of the pieces themselves; the mass of the projectile increased\r\nas the cube, the propulsive force of the gases as the square, of the\r\ndiameter of the bore; hence to attain a given velocity, the larger the\r\nbore the higher the pressure required to propel it with a given type\r\nof powder,--other things being equal. No limit, therefore, could be\r\nassigned to the strength and power required of heavy ordnance. Moreover\r\na struggle had begun in ’59, with the building of the _Gloire_ and\r\n_Warrior_, which was already foreshadowing tremendous developments both\r\nof guns and of armour.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of America in this connection were not encouraging.\r\nThe civil war served as an incentive to the Americans to rifle all\r\ntheir large calibre guns as quickly as possible. In ’62 large numbers\r\nof cast-iron cannon were rifled and reinforced by external hoops of\r\niron. The results were deplorable. A great number of pieces burst; and\r\nexperience made it clear that “a gun made up of a single homogeneous\r\ncasting soon reaches a limit of resistance to internal pressure beyond\r\nwhich the addition of extra metal has little or no effect.” Two\r\nimprovements must be mentioned as having more than a passing effect on\r\nthe progress of ordnance in America: first, the adoption of compressed\r\nand perforated powder which, by prolonging the combustion period,\r\ncaused a more even distribution of stresses over all sections of the\r\nbarrel; second, the casting of guns hollow and the chilling of their\r\ninteriors, so as to form on the inside of the piece a hardened stratum\r\non which the outer parts of the casting contracted as they slowly\r\ncooled, thus giving it support. But in spite of these inventions it\r\nbecame apparent that cast iron was in its nature unsuited as a material\r\nfor rifled ordnance.\r\n\r\nIn England a safer method of conversion was followed. Guns were bored\r\nout, on a scheme proposed in ’63 by Major Palliser, and accurately\r\nturned tubes of coiled wrought iron were fitted in them, which\r\nwere afterwards rifled. The resulting pieces consisted, then, of a\r\nwrought-iron inner tube, supported by a surrounding cast-iron jacket\r\nagainst which, on firing, the inner tube expanded. Thus converted, the\r\nold smooth-bores were enabled to develop an energy far in excess of\r\ntheir original limit, and so to prolong for some years their period of\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the cast-iron guns was seen to be only a temporary\r\nexpedient. Just as the smooth-bore cannon, after a last effort\r\nto overcome iron plates with spherical solid shot of the largest\r\ncalibre, withdrew from the competition; so, as the thickness of\r\narmour increased, the converted cast-iron cannon, with its special\r\narmour-piercing shot of chilled iron, soon reached the limit of its\r\npower and gave place to the rifled artillery of wrought iron or steel.\r\n\r\nAnd now, rifled ordnance having definitely supplanted the smooth-bore,\r\na new struggle arose between the various systems of gunmaking, and\r\nmore especially between the two rival methods of loading: by the\r\nbreech and by the muzzle. The prognostications of those who had\r\ndoubted whether the latter method was suitable for large ordnance were\r\nseen to be partially justified. Other nations had already relapsed\r\ninto muzzle-loading, impressed by the complexity and weakness of the\r\nbreech-loading systems of Cavalli, Wahrendorf and other inventors.\r\nBesides ourselves only the Prussians, the originators of the\r\nbreech-loading rifled musket in its modern form, continued to trust in\r\nbreech-loading ordnance. The Italians, following the example of the\r\nFrench and Americans, abandoned the system. “Thus,” said an English\r\nauthority in ’62, “while, after more than four centuries of trial,\r\nother nations were giving up the moveable breech, ... we are still\r\ngoing from plan to plan in the hope of effecting what will, even if\r\nsuccessful in closing the breech, be scarcely safe with the heavy\r\ncharges necessary for smashing armour plates.”[129]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, ’63, the committee appointed to carry out the\r\ncompetitive trials between Whitworth and Armstrong guns, reported that\r\nthe many-grooved system of rifling, with its lead-coated projectiles\r\nand complicated breech-loading arrangements, entailing the use of tin\r\ncaps for obturation and lubricators for the rifling grooves, was far\r\ninferior for the general purposes of war to both of the muzzle-loading\r\nsystems tried. This view received early and practical confirmation\r\nfrom a report sent to the Admiralty by Vice-Admiral Sir Augustus\r\nKuper, after the bombardment of Kagosima. In that action several\r\naccidents occurred owing to the Armstrong guns being fired with their\r\nbreech-blocks not properly screwed up. The guns were accordingly\r\nwithdrawn from service and replaced by muzzle-loaders. In 1864 England\r\nreverted definitely to muzzle-loading ordnance, which, in the face of\r\nviolent controversy and in spite of the gradual reconversion of her\r\nrivals to the breech-loading principle, she maintained for the next\r\nfifteen years. Whitworth’s system was adopted in the main, but the\r\nhexagonal form of bore and projectile was avoided. Studded projectiles\r\nwere approved, the pieces being rifled with a few broad shallow grooves\r\nnot unlike those used by the French. England at last possessed a\r\nmuzzle-loading sea ordnance, characterized by ease and rapidity of\r\nloading, accuracy, cheapness, and capacity for firing, in emergency,\r\nspherical shot as well as rifled projectiles.\r\n\r\nWhat was the effect of this retrogression upon the status of our naval\r\narmaments?\r\n\r\nIt seems frequently to have been held that, in view of the eventual\r\nvictory of the breech-loading gun, the policy of reverting to\r\nmuzzle-loading was wrong, and that this country was thereby placed at\r\na serious disadvantage to her rivals. Several good reasons existed,\r\nhowever, for the preference given to muzzle-loading ordnance at that\r\ntime. The accidents with removable breeches had been numerous and\r\ndemoralizing. Muzzle-loading guns, besides the advantages which they\r\npossessed of strength, solidity and simplicity of construction, offered\r\nimportant advantages in ease and rapidity of loading--particularly\r\nin the case of turret or barbette guns, where “outside loading” was\r\na great convenience. On the other hand the principal deficiency of\r\nthe muzzle-loader, namely, the large windage required with studded\r\nprojectiles, was now eliminated by the invention of the cupped “gas\r\ncheck,” a copper disc attached to the rear of the projectile which, on\r\ndischarge, expanded automatically and sealed the bore.\r\n\r\nExpert opinion confirmed the wisdom of the government policy.\r\nExperience, in the Franco-Prussian war and elsewhere, confirmed the\r\nviews of the experts. “Reviewing the action of the artillerists who\r\ndecided to adopt muzzle-loaders, with the greater experience we now\r\npossess it seems that they were right in their decision at the time it\r\nwas first made; but there was too much hesitation in coming back to\r\nbreech-loaders when new discoveries and great progress in powder quite\r\naltered conditions.”[130] In fact, once having abandoned the disparaged\r\nsystem, the country was with difficulty persuaded by the professionals\r\nto retrace its steps. In the end, ordnance followed small arms; the\r\nresearches of Captain Noble at Elswick proved conclusively to the world\r\nat large the necessity for a reversion to breech-loading; and in 1880\r\nthe muzzle-loading gun was finally superseded by a greatly improved\r\nform of breech-loader.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the state of knowledge and the conditions under which ordnance\r\nwas manufactured were certainly altered from those of ’64. The struggle\r\nbetween guns and armour begun with the _Gloire_ and _Warrior_ had\r\ncontinued. In the presence of the new powers of mechanical science,\r\nartillerists and shipbuilders had sought to plumb the possibilities of\r\noffensive and defensive elements in warship design. Guns influenced\r\narmour, armour reacted on guns; both revolutionized contemporary naval\r\narchitecture. It was in the effort to aggrandize the power of guns\r\nthat Noble discovered that, with the existing powders and with the\r\nshort muzzle-loading gun, a natural limit of power was soon reached.\r\nBetter results could only be obtained, he showed, by the adoption of\r\nslow-burning powder and a longer gun; by the avoidance of the sudden\r\nhigh chamber pressure which resulted from the small-grained powder,\r\nand the substitution for it of a chamber pressure which would rise\r\ngradually to a safe maximum and then suffer only a gradual reduction as\r\nthe gases expanded behind the moving projectile. The work done by the\r\ngases on the projectile could by this means be enormously increased.\r\nBut, for this result, larger powder-charges were required; and these\r\nlarger charges of slow-burning powder were found to require much\r\nlarger chambers than those embodied in existing guns; in short, the\r\nnew conditions called for a new shape of gun. Long guns, having powder\r\nchambers of larger diameter than that of the bore, were necessary, and\r\nthese could not conveniently be made muzzle-loading.\r\n\r\nSo a return to the breech-loading ordnance became inevitable, and the\r\nchange was made. The old Armstrong moveable vent-piece was avoided,\r\nhowever, in the new designs; of the two alternative breech-closing\r\nsystems in use, viz. the wedge system of Krupp and the “interrupted\r\nscrew” system of the French, the latter was adopted. A steel tube,\r\nrifled on the polygroove system, formed the body of the piece, and this\r\nwas strengthened by hoops of iron or steel shrunk on its exterior. The\r\nnew gun yielded a very great increase of power. Muzzle-loading guns\r\nwere at once displaced, in the projected programme of new battleships,\r\nfor the new type of ordnance, and a further series of revolutionary\r\nchanges in ship armament at once took place. Other nations had already\r\naugmented the length and power of their guns. By the adoption of the\r\nimproved breech-loading ordnance, Great Britain, who for the last few\r\nyears had been falling behind her rivals, not only drew level with them\r\nbut definitely took the lead in the power of her heavy ordnance: a lead\r\nwhich from that time to this she has successfully maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPROPELLING MACHINERY\r\n\r\n\r\nNo aspect of old naval warfare is so difficult for the modern reader\r\nto visualize, perhaps, as that which displays the essential weakness\r\nof the sailing warship: its impotence in a calm. It was a creature\r\nrequiring for its activities two elements, air and water. Ruffle the\r\nsea with a breeze, and the sailing ship had power of motion towards\r\nmost of the points of the compass; withdraw the winds, and she lay\r\nglued to the smooth water or rolling dangerously in the heavy swell,\r\nwithout power either of turning or translation. For centuries this\r\nweakness told heavily against her and in favour of the oar-propelled\r\nvessel, particularly in certain latitudes. Through many years, indeed,\r\nthe two types held ascendancy each in its own waters; in the smooth\r\nstretches of the Mediterranean the oar-driven galley, light, swift,\r\nand using its sharp ram or bow-cannon as chief means of offence or\r\ndefence, was a deadly danger to the becalmed sailing ship; in the\r\nrougher north Atlantic the sailing ship, strong, heavy, capacious,\r\nand armed for attack and defence only along its sides, proved far\r\ntoo fast and powerful for the oar-driven rival. Progress--increase\r\nof size, improvement in artillery, the development of the science of\r\nnavigation--favoured the sailing ship, so that there came at last the\r\nday when, even in the Mediterranean, she attained ascendancy over the\r\ngalley. But always there was this inherent weakness: in a dead calm\r\nthe sailing ship lay open to attack from a quarter where her defence\r\nlay bare. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, perhaps, she could move\r\nsufficiently to beat off her attacker by bringing her broadsides\r\nto bear. The hundredth, she lay at the mercy of her adversary, who\r\ncould, by choosing his range and quarter of attack, make her temporary\r\ninferiority the occasion of defeat. For this military reason many\r\nattempts were made to supplement sails with oars. But oars and sails\r\nwere incompatible. They were often, seen together in early times,\r\nbut with progress the use of one became more and more irreconcilable\r\nwith the use of the other. The Tudor galleasse, though possessing\r\nin our northern waters many advantages over the galley type, had\r\nthe defects inherent in the compromise, and gave place in a short\r\ntime to the high-charged “great ship” propelled by sails alone. The\r\nsailing ship was by that time strong and powerful enough to risk the\r\none-in-a-hundred chance of being attacked by oared galleys in a stark\r\ncalm. It was only when the first steam vessels plied English waters\r\nthat the old weakness became apparent again. It was then seriously\r\nurged that the ship-of-the-line should carry oars once more, against\r\nthe attack of small steamers converging on her from a weakly defended\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIP AND GALLEY\r\n\r\n(From Tartagliá’s _Arte of Shooting_, English Ed., A.D. 1588.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe oar was in many ways an objectionable form of power. It was very\r\nvulnerable, its presence made manœuvring at close quarters risky and\r\ndifficult; and apart from the necessity, on which the galley service\r\nwas based, of a large supply of slave-labour for working them, oars and\r\nthe rowers absorbed a large proportion of the available inboard space,\r\nto the detriment both of artillery and merchandise.\r\n\r\nMany attempts were therefore made, not only to substitute animals for\r\nmen, for the work of propulsion, but to apply power in a manner more\r\nsuitable than by the primitive method of levers: oars or sweeps. The\r\npaddlewheel was thought of at a very early date; a Roman army is said\r\nto have been transported into Sicily by boats propelled by wheels moved\r\nby oxen, and in many old military treatises the substitution of wheels\r\nfor oars is mentioned.[131] In 1588 Ramelli, engineer-in-ordinary to\r\nthe French king, published a book in which was sketched an amphibious\r\nvehicle propelled by hand-worked paddlewheels: “une sorte de canot\r\nautomobile blindé et percé de meurtrières pour les arquesbusiers.”\r\nIn 1619 Torelli, Governor of Malta, fitted a ship with paddles, and\r\nin it passed through the Straits of Messina against the tide. But\r\nRichelieu, to whom he offered his invention, was not impressed with\r\nits value.[132] Before this, Blasco de Garoy, a Spanish captain, had\r\nexhibited to the Emperor Charles V, in 1543, an engine by which ships\r\nof the largest size could be propelled in a calm: an arrangement of\r\nhand-operated paddlewheels.\r\n\r\nIn Bourne’s _Inventions and Devices_, published in 1578, is the first\r\nmention of paddlewheels (so far as we know) in any English book. By\r\nthe placing of certain wheels on the outside of the boat, he says, and\r\n“so turning the wheels by some provision,” the boat may be made to go.\r\nAnd then he proceeds to mention the inversion of the paddlewheel, or\r\nthe paddlewheel which is driven, as distinguished from the paddlewheel\r\nwhich drives. “They make a watermill in a boat, for when that it rideth\r\nat an anker, the tide or stream will turn the wheels with great force,\r\nand these mills are used in France,” etc. It is possible, indeed, that\r\nthis was the prior form, and that the earliest paddlewheel was a mill\r\nand not primarily a means of propelling the vessel.\r\n\r\nEarly in the seventeenth century the mechanical sciences began to\r\ndevelop rapidly and as the century advanced the flood of patents for\r\nthe propulsion of ships increased. “To make boats, ships, and barges\r\nto go against the wind and tide”; “the drawing and working of barges\r\nand other vessels without the use of horses”; “for making vessels to\r\nnavigate in a straight line with all winds though contrary”; these\r\nare some of the patents granted, the details of which are not known.\r\nAt last the ingenious Marquis of Worcester, who in 1663 was granted a\r\npatent for his steam engine, also obtained a patent for an invention\r\nfor propelling a vessel against wind and stream. It has sometimes been\r\ninferred that this invention was connected in some way with the steam\r\nengine, and the claim has been made that the Marquis was one of the\r\nfirst authors of steam propulsion. This is not so. Contained in the\r\ndescription of the ship-propelling invention are two statements which\r\ndispose completely of the theory that steam was the motive force;\r\nfirst, that the “force of the wind or stream causeth its (the engine’s)\r\nmotion”; secondly, that “the more rapid the stream, the faster it (the\r\nvessel) advances against it.” From this it appears that the Marquis\r\nintended to utilize the watermill as described by Bourne. From a study\r\nof the description of the apparatus it has been concluded that “a\r\nrope fastened at one end up the stream, and at the other to the axis\r\nof waterwheels lying across the boat, and dipping into the water so\r\nas to be turned by the wheels, would fulfil the conditions proposed\r\nof advancing the boat faster, the more rapid the stream; and when at\r\nanchor such wheels might have been applied to other purposes.”[133] If\r\nthis reconstruction is correct, the scope of the propelling device was\r\nvery limited.\r\n\r\nIn Bushnell’s _Compleat Shipwright_, published in 1678, a proposal\r\nwas made for working oars by pivoting them at the vessel’s side and\r\nconnecting their inboard ends by longitudinal rods operated by cranks\r\ngeared to a centre-line capstan. But the disadvantages of oars so\r\nused must have been apparent, and there is no evidence that this\r\ninvention was ever put into practice. The obvious alternative was\r\nthe paddlewheel, and though that device had been known and used in a\r\nprimitive form long before the seventeenth century, it was continually\r\nbeing reinvented (especially in the ’nineties) and tried by inventors\r\nin various countries. Denis Papin turned his original mind to the\r\nsolution of this problem. A paper on the subject written by him in\r\nGermany in 1690 is of interest. Discussing the use of oars from ships’\r\nsides he notes that, “Common oars could not be conveniently used in\r\nthis way, and it would be necessary to use for this purpose those of\r\na rotary construction, such as I remember to have seen at London.\r\nThey were affixed to a machine made by direction of Prince Rupert,\r\nand were set in motion by horses, so as to produce a much greater\r\nvelocity than could be given by sixteen watermen to the Royal Barge.”\r\nPapin, who had suggested the atmospheric steam engine, also suggested\r\nthe possible application of steam to propulsion. But it was left to\r\nothers to achieve what he had to propose. His talent, it has been\r\nsaid, lay rather in speculations on ingenious combinations, than in\r\nthe mechanical power of carrying them into execution on a great scale.\r\nIn 1708 he laid before the Royal Society, accompanied by a letter of\r\nrecommendation from Leibnitz, a definite proposal for a boat “to be\r\nmoved with oars by heat ... by an engine after the manner that has\r\nbeen practised at Cassel.” What form this engine was to take, and how\r\nthe power was to be transmitted to the oars, is still a matter of\r\nconjecture. Only this is known, that the proposal was considered in\r\ndetail by the president, Sir Isaac Newton, and that on his advice no\r\nfurther action was taken.[134]\r\n\r\nIn France it has been widely claimed that Papin actually engined a\r\nboat and propelled it over the waters of the Weser by the force of\r\nsteam. His biographer states that on the 24th September, 1707, Papin\r\n“embarquait sur le premier bateau à vapeur toute sa fortune.”[135]\r\nBut the statement is not correct. The misconception, like that which\r\nassigned to the Marquis of Worcester the invention of a steam-propelled\r\nvessel, was doubtless due to the fact that the inventor was known to\r\nbe engaged in the study of the steam engine and of ship-propelling\r\nmechanism. The two things, though distinct in themselves, were readily\r\ncombined in the minds of his admirers. It is generally agreed to-day,\r\nwe think, even by his own countrymen, that Papin, though he may claim\r\nthe honour of having first suggested the application of steam to ship\r\npropulsion, never himself achieved a practical success.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Savery in England had produced his successful engine.\r\nIn his case, too, the claim has been made that he first proposed steam\r\npropulsion for ships. But in his _Miner’s Friend_ this able mechanician\r\nshowed that he recognized the limited application of his steam engine.\r\n“I believe,” he says, “it may be made very _useful_ to ships, but I\r\ndare not meddle with that matter; and leave it to the judgment of those\r\nwho are the best judges of maritime affairs.” But in propulsion by\r\nhand-operated paddlewheels Savery was an enthusiastic believer. In 1698\r\nhe had published, in a book bearing the title, “_Navigation Improv’d:\r\nOr the Art of Rowing Ships of all Rates, in Calms, with a more easy,\r\nswift, and steady Motion than Oars can_,” a description of a mechanism\r\nconsisting of paddlewheels formed of oars fitted radially to drumheads\r\nwhich were mounted on the two ends of an iron bar placed horizontally\r\nacross the ship. This bar was geared by mortice wheels with another\r\nbar mounted vertically as the axis of a capstan; rotation of the\r\ncapstan was thus transmitted to the paddlewheels. Savery fitted this\r\nmechanism to a wherry and carried out successful trials on the Thames\r\nbefore thousands of people. But the Navy Board would not consider it.\r\nThey had incurred a loss, it appeared, on a horse tow-vessel which had\r\nbeen in use at Chatham a few years previously: a vessel which towed\r\nthe greatest ships with the help of four, six, or eight horses, and\r\nwhich, incidentally, may have influenced Savery in adopting the term\r\n“horse power” as the unit of work for his steam engine. The sanguine\r\ninventor made great efforts to interest the authorities, but without\r\navail; the Surveyor rejected the proposal. So in an angry mood Savery\r\npublished his book, with a description of his mechanism and an account\r\nof his efforts to interest the authorities, to show how one man’s\r\nhumour had obstructed his engine. “You see, Reader, what to trust to,”\r\nhe concluded, “though you have found out an improvement as great to\r\nshipping as turning to windward, or the compass; unless you can sit\r\nround the green table in Crutched Friars, your invention is damned of\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\nThe first detailed scheme for applying steam-power to ship propulsion\r\nwas contained in the patent of Jonathan Hulls, in 1736. Though great\r\ncredit is generally given to this inventor (who has even been dubbed\r\nthe father of steam navigation), it does not appear that in reality\r\nhe contributed much to the advancement of the problem; which was,\r\nindeed, still waiting on the development of the steam engine. Hulls’\r\nnotion, explained in a pamphlet which he published in 1737, was to\r\nconnect the piston of a Newcomen engine by a rope gearing with some\r\nwheels mounted in the waist of the vessel, which wheels oscillated as\r\nthe piston moved up and down. These wheels were in turn connected by\r\nrope gearing with a large fan-wheel mounted in a frame rigged out over\r\nthe vessel’s stern, the fans in their lowest position dipping into\r\nthe water. The oscillating motion of the inboard wheels was converted\r\ninto a continuous ahead motion of the fan-wheel by means of a ratchet.\r\nWith this machinery he designed to tow ships in harbours and rivers.\r\nIt must, however, be remarked that the invention was never more than\r\na paper project; and that if Hulls had tried to translate his ideas\r\ninto three dimensions he would have encountered, in all probability,\r\ninsuperable practical difficulties. One very original suggestion of\r\nhis certainly deserves notice; as a special case he proposed that when\r\nthe tow-boat was used in shallow rivers two cranks, fitted to the axis\r\nof his driving wheels, should operate two long poles of sufficient\r\nlength to reach the bottom of the river; these trailing poles, moving\r\nalternately forward, would propel the vessel. Here is an early\r\napplication of the crank. But in this case it will be noted that the\r\ncrank is driven, and that it converts a rotary into a reciprocating\r\nmotion; in short, it is an inversion of the driving crank which, as\r\napplied to the steam engine, was not invented till some years later.\r\n\r\nAs before remarked, the whole problem of steam propulsion waited upon\r\nthe development of the steam engine. In the meantime the application of\r\nconvenient forms of man power received considerable study, especially\r\nin France. In Bouguer’s _Traité du Navire_ the problem was investigated\r\nof propulsion by blades or panels, hinged, and folding when not in\r\nuse against the vessel’s sides; and in 1753 the prize offered by the\r\nAcademy of Sciences for an essay on the subject was won by Daniel\r\nBernouilli, for a plan on those lines. Euler proposed paddlewheels on a\r\ntransverse shaft geared like Savery’s, by mortice wheels to a multiple\r\ncapstan. Variations of this method were proposed by other writers and\r\ninventors, and some of the best intellects in France attacked the\r\nproblem. But nothing definite resulted. The most valuable result of\r\nthe discussion was the conclusion drawn by M. Gautier, a professor of\r\nmathematics at Nancy, that the strength of the crew was not sufficient\r\nto give any great velocity to a ship. He proposed, therefore, as the\r\nonly means of attaining that object, the employment of a steam engine,\r\nand pointed out several ways in which it might be applied to produce a\r\nrotary motion.[136]\r\n\r\nIn the course of time the problem marched forward to a solution. The\r\nfirst great improvement in the steam engine which rendered it adaptable\r\nto marine use was the invention by Watt of the “double impulse”;\r\nthe second, Pickard’s invention of the crank and connecting-rod. By\r\nvirtue of these two developments the steam engine was made capable of\r\nimparting to a shaft a continuous rotary motion without the medium of\r\nnoisy, brittle or inefficient gearing. As soon as engines having this\r\npower were placed on the public market attempts were made to mount\r\nthem in boats and larger vessels; steam navigation was discerned as a\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nOf the many efforts which were made at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury to apply steam power to the propulsion of ships a striking\r\nfeature is their complete independence from each other and from the\r\nresults of prior experience and research. Little information is\r\navailable as to the results of various experiments which were known\r\nto be carried on in France at this time, and, with all respect, it is\r\nimprobable that they contributed in any way to the subsequent evolution\r\nof the steam vessel. The Abbé Darnal in 1781, M. de Jouffroi in 1782,\r\nand M. Desblancs in 1802 and 1803, proposed or constructed steamboats.\r\nM. de Jouffroi is said to have made several successful attempts on the\r\nSaone at Lyons; but the intervention of the Revolution put an end to\r\nhis undertakings.\r\n\r\nIn Britain a successful attempt to apply the steam engine to the\r\npaddlewheel was made in 1788. In that year three men, combining\r\ninitiative, financial resource, and a large measure of engineering\r\ningenuity, proved the possibility of steam propulsion in an experiment\r\nsingularly complete and of singularly little effect on subsequent\r\nprogress. In the summer of ’87 a wealthy and inventive banker, Mr.\r\nPatrick Miller of Dalswinton, Edinburgh, had been making experiments\r\nin the Firth of Forth with a double vessel of his own invention, sixty\r\nfeet long, which, when wind failed for sailing, was set in motion by\r\ntwo paddlewheels. These paddlewheels were fitted between the two hulls\r\nof the vessel and were worked by men, by means of a geared capstan.\r\nMiller believed that a boat furnished with paddlewheels and worked\r\nmanually would be of great advantage for working in shallow rivers\r\nand canals. But the result of a sailing race between his boat and a\r\ncustom-house wherry of Leith, in which his own sails were supplemented\r\nby the labours of four men at the wheels, convinced him that manpower\r\nwas insufficient. His sons’ tutor, a Mr. Taylor, suggested the\r\napplication of a steam engine. And being acquainted with an engineer\r\nnamed Symington, Taylor prevailed on his patron to engage him to mount\r\na one-horse-power engine in a double pleasure boat, upon the lake\r\nat Dalswinton. The experiment was a complete success. “The vessel\r\nmoved delightfully, and notwithstanding the smallness of the cylinder\r\n(4 inches diameter), at the rate of 5 miles an hour. After amusing\r\nourselves a few days the engine was removed and carried into the house,\r\nwhere it remained as a piece of ornamental furniture for a number of\r\nyears.”[137] Determined to pursue the experiment, Miller ordered a\r\nreplica of the original engine on a larger scale, and this engine, with\r\na cylinder of 18 inches diameter, was erected at Carron and fitted to\r\na larger boat. This also was successful. But no further trials were\r\nmade after ’89; for Patrick Miller, who had spent a large sum in order\r\nto establish the feasibility of the invention, decided to close his\r\ninvestigations, and to turn to other pursuits.\r\n\r\nNo further attempt was made in Great Britain until 1801, when Lord\r\nDundas engaged Symington to make a series of experiments on the\r\nsubstitution of steam power for horse towage of barges on the Forth and\r\nClyde canal: experiments which resulted in the _Charlotte Dundas_. In\r\nthis celebrated vessel a double-acting Watt engine, with its 22-inch\r\ndiameter cylinder mounted horizontally on the deck, actuated, through\r\na simple connecting-rod and a crank with a 4-foot throw, a paddlewheel\r\nwhich was carried in a centre-line recess at the stern. In March, ’03,\r\nSymington in the _Charlotte Dundas_ towed two 70-ton vessels nineteen\r\nmiles against a strong head wind in six hours. Success seemed assured\r\nto him. His reputation was already high, and now an invitation came\r\nfrom the Duke of Bridgewater for eight similar tow-boats to ply on\r\nhis canal. But the inventor’s hopes were disappointed. The Duke died\r\nsuddenly, and the governing body of the Forth and Clyde canal vetoed\r\nthe further use of steam vessels for fear of the damage the waves might\r\ncause the banks. Other bodies took the same view, and thus came to an\r\nend an important passage in the history of steam navigation. It is\r\nremarkable, considering the efforts which had been made by inventors\r\nfrom the sixteenth century onwards to improve on oar-propulsion for\r\nmilitary purposes, that Miller, Symington, and their friends do not\r\nseem to have envisaged any use for steamboats other than as tugs on\r\ncanals. It is remarkable that in the presence of this initial success\r\nneither the government nor the public showed any realization of the\r\npossibilities which it unfolded; that no attempt was made by commercial\r\nenterprise--even if, in the realm of naval strategy, such an innovation\r\nwas regarded as impolitic or impracticable[138]--to develop its\r\nadvantages and to secure an undisputed lead in the new application of\r\nsteam power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE “CHARLOTTE DUNDAS”\r\n\r\n(From Fincham.)]\r\n\r\nIt was in America that the most persistent and continuous development\r\ntook place, quite independently of efforts elsewhere and almost\r\ncontemporaneously with those above described. America, whose\r\ngeographical conditions made water transport relatively far more\r\nimportant than it was in Great Britain, lent a ready ear to the schemes\r\nof inventors. In 1784 James Rumsey, and shortly afterwards John Fitch,\r\nhad already laid plans before General Washington for the propulsion of\r\nboats by steam.\r\n\r\nJohn Fitch, whose original idea was a steamboat propelled by means\r\nof an endless chain of flat boards, afterwards experimented with\r\nan arrangement, “borrowed no doubt from the action of Indians in a\r\ncanoe,” of paddles held vertically in frames mounted along the sides\r\nof the boat and operated by cranks. In 1786 a boat thus equipped made\r\na successful trial on the Delaware, and in the following year a larger\r\nboat, fitted with a horizontal double-acting engine with a 12-inch\r\ncylinder and a 3-foot stroke, giving motion to six paddles on each\r\nside, was publicly tried on the same river. The speed attained was\r\nvery small. At last in 1790, still protected by a patent which granted\r\nhim a temporary monopoly in steamboat building, Fitch succeeded in\r\nbuilding a boat which was an undisputed mechanical success. Discarding\r\nthe paddle-frame and adopting a beam engine to drive paddle-boards\r\nat the stern, he produced a steamboat which, after being tested and\r\ncredited with eight knots’ speed on a measured mile in front of Water\r\nStreet, Philadelphia, in the presence of the governor and council\r\nof Pennsylvania, ran two or three thousand miles as a passenger\r\nboat on the Delaware before being dismantled. It was a considerable\r\nachievement. But the excessive weight and space absorbed by the\r\nmachinery prevented the boat from being a financial success; and, after\r\na journey to France, then distracted by the Revolution, Fitch returned\r\nhome to America and ended his days a disappointed and a broken man.\r\nNevertheless, the work he did was of service to others. He proved that\r\nthe ponderous nature of the machinery was the greatest obstacle to\r\nthe propulsion of small craft by steam, and from his failure deduced\r\nthe conclusion, on which later inventors were able to build, that the\r\nsolution of the problem lay in the _scale_: that, “it would be much\r\neasier to carry a first-rate man-of-war by steam at an equal rate than\r\na small boat.”[139]\r\n\r\nJames Rumsey, a Virginian, carried out in 1775 the first practical\r\ntrials of water-jet propulsion, a small boat of his plying the Potomac\r\nat a small speed by means of a steam pump which sucked in water at the\r\nbow and threw it out at the stern. But as he felt himself obstructed\r\nin further experiments by the patent rights which had been given his\r\nrival Fitch he came to England; where, financed by a wealthy compatriot\r\nand aided by James Watt himself, he produced in ’93 a boat which on the\r\nThames attained a speed of over four knots. Unfortunately Rumsey died\r\nin the middle of his experiments.\r\n\r\nAn individual of extraordinary qualities had now turned his attention\r\nto the problem of steam propulsion. In that same year a young American\r\nartist, Robert Fulton, who had come to England to work under the\r\nguidance of his countryman Benjamin West, wrote to Lord Stanhope\r\ninforming him of a plan which he had formed for moving ships by steam.\r\nLord Stanhope, well known as a scientific inventor, had recently been\r\nexperimenting with a vessel fitted with a 12-horse-power engine of\r\nBoulton and Watt’s working a propeller which operated like the foot of\r\nan aquatic bird. A correspondence ensued. Fulton, whose self-confidence\r\nequalled his originality, illustrated by drawings and diagrams his\r\nideas on the subject. At first, he said, he thought of applying the\r\nforce of an engine to an oar or paddle which, hinged on the counter\r\nat the stern, by a reciprocating motion would urge the vessel ahead.\r\nBut on experimenting with a clockwork model he found that, though the\r\nboat sprang forward, the return stroke of the paddle interfered with\r\nthe continuity of the motion. “I then endeavoured,” he wrote, “to give\r\nit a circular motion, which I effected by applying two paddles on an\r\naxis. Then the boat moved by jerks; there was too great a space between\r\nthe strokes. I then applied three paddles, forming an equilateral\r\ntriangle to which I gave a circular motion.” These paddles he proposed\r\nto place in cast-iron wheels one on each side of the boat and mounted\r\non the same shaft at some height over the waterline, so that each wheel\r\nwould “answer as a fly and brace to the perpendicular oars.” And he\r\nstated that he found, from his experiments with models, that three or\r\nsix oars gave better results than any other number. From which it is\r\nclear that the paddlewheel was evolved by Fulton from the simple paddle\r\nindependently of suggestion received from previous inventors.\r\n\r\nSome time was to elapse before the results of his experiments were\r\nutilized. Attracted by the boom in canal construction then in vogue\r\nFulton devoted his mind to that subject; though in this connection\r\nthe idea of steam-propelled boats still occupied him, as is shown\r\nby a letter he wrote in ’94 to Messrs. Boulton and Watt, asking for\r\nan estimate of costs and dimensions of “an engine with a rotative\r\nmovement of the purchase of 3 or 4 horses which is designed to be\r\nplaced in a boat.” From England he went to Paris, to try his fortune at\r\nhalf a dozen projects. In ’98 he was experimenting on the Seine with a\r\nscrew propeller--“a fly of four parts similar to that of a smoke-jack,”\r\nwhich gave promising results. This screw propeller, however, was as yet\r\nunrecognized as the propulsive medium of the future. It had already\r\nbeen patented in England by Bramah in 1785--“a wheel with inclined\r\nfans, or wings, similar to the fly of a smoke-jack or the vertical\r\nsails of a windmill”; and, hand-operated, it had actually been used\r\nin America in 1776 by Bushnell in connection with his submarine. But\r\nin 1802 Fulton had decided against the screw, and in favour of the\r\npaddlewheel.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that an introduction to an influential\r\ncompatriot, himself an experimenter in steam propulsion, gave Fulton\r\nthe opportunity to display his talents to their mutual advantage.\r\nChancellor Livingston, U.S. Minister to France, was aware of the\r\nenormous advantages which would accrue to America (and to the happy\r\ninventor) if steam propulsion could be achieved economically. With\r\nFulton’s aid he decided on building an experimental steam vessel\r\nin France, with a view to transferring to America for commercial\r\nenterprise the perfected results of their labour. A partnership was\r\nformed, the work proceeded; but the experimental steamboat, whose\r\nscantlings were unequal to supporting the weight of the 8-horsepower\r\nmachinery placed on board, sank at her moorings in a storm. A second\r\nboat, stronger and bigger, attained complete success. Fulton promptly\r\nwrote to Messrs. Boulton and Watt asking them to export to America a\r\n24-horse-power engine complete with all accessories, in accordance\r\nwith his sketches; and with a brass air-pump suitable for working in\r\nsalt water. Then, going himself to England, he visited Messrs. Boulton\r\nand Watt and gleaned what information he could as to the properties\r\nof their machinery; studied the newly published results of Colonel\r\nBeaufoy’s experiments on ship form and fluid resistance; and journeyed\r\nto Scotland to visit Symington and see the famous _Charlotte Dundas_.\r\n\r\nArmed with this knowledge, with all the experience of Rumsey and Fitch,\r\nand with the data from his own trials, Fulton brought to a successful\r\nsolution the problem of steam propulsion on a commercial scale. It\r\nhas been remarked that there was no element in the _Clermont_ or her\r\nsuccessors so original in conception that it would entitle Fulton to\r\nbe regarded as the inventor of steam navigation. Nor did he himself\r\nclaim to be such. He was successful in fitting together the elements,\r\nthe inventions of others. Science is measurement, and Fulton applied\r\nhis data and measured with great insight, adapting his elements in the\r\nright manner and proportion to form an efficient whole. “He was the\r\nfirst to treat the elementary factors in steamship design--dimensions,\r\nform, horse-power, speed, etc.--in a scientific spirit; to him belongs\r\nthe credit of having coupled the boat and engine as a working unit.”\r\nFrom Fitch he had learned the economy of size, and the advantages of\r\nenlarging the scale of operations; from Beaufoy, the importance of a\r\nfair underwater form, with a sharp bow and stern. From Symington, who\r\ngenerously took him for a trip in the _Charlotte Dundas_, he could\r\nnot fail to have gleaned much practical advice and information; it is\r\nremarkable, in this connection, that, after a sight of Symington’s\r\nhorizontal cylinder with its simple connecting-rod drive to the\r\nstern wheel, he should have adhered to the vertical cylinder and the\r\nbell-crank or beam for the transmission of the force: an initial\r\ndivergence which was perpetuated, and which became the hall-mark\r\ndistinguishing American from English practice for some years to come.\r\nMost of his knowledge he gained by his activities in England, and many\r\nwriters have contested a claim--which so far as is known was never\r\nmade by him--to the invention of the steamship. His achievements were\r\nwell defined and legitimately executed, and the remarkable insight and\r\ninitiative which he displayed in adapting the labours of others to\r\nserve his own utilitarian ends cannot, surely, deserve the opprobrium\r\ncast on them by some of the nineteenth-century writers. Prometheus,\r\nit is said, stole fire from heaven. Fulton bought his in the open\r\nmarket; obtaining his engine in Soho and his boiler in Smithfield\r\nhe transported them across the Atlantic, and in 1807 produced the\r\n_Clermont_.\r\n\r\nThe _Clermont_, a flat-bottomed wall-sided craft 166 feet in length and\r\nonly 18 feet in beam, steamed at a speed of five knots from New York\r\nto Albany, in August, 1807; to the surprise of thousands of spectators\r\nwho knew her as “Fulton’s folly,” and whose shouts of derision gave\r\nplace to silence, and then to a chorus of applause and congratulation.\r\nMany of the inhabitants of the banks of the Hudson had never heard\r\neven of an engine, much less of a steamboat. “A monster moving on the\r\nwaters, defying the winds and tide, and breathing flames and smoke!\r\nThe first steamboat used dry pine wood for fuel, which sends forth a\r\ncolumn of ignited vapour many feet above the flue, and, whenever the\r\nfire is stirred, a galaxy of sparks fly off which, in the night, have\r\na very brilliant and beautiful appearance.”[140] The _Clermont_ was\r\nfollowed by others, each an improvement on the last; until in 1816,\r\nso rapid was the process of evolution, the _Chancellor Livingston_\r\nwas built, ship-shaped, with figure-head and fine bows, faired sides\r\nand tapering stern, with engines of 75-horse-power and with promenade\r\ndecks and accommodation for 120 passengers. Certain characteristics\r\nnow showed themselves in all American construction. The engines were\r\nmounted with cylinders vertical, their rods actuating large overhead\r\nbeams which transmitted the force of the steam to the paddlewheels.\r\nThe boats were made very broad to give the necessary stability, the\r\nmachinery being carried high; and to reduce their underwater resistance\r\nas much as possible their bodies were made full near the water-line and\r\nlean below. For the same reason, and since the principal weights were\r\nconcentrated amidships, fine forward and after bodies were given them;\r\na rising floor, and a deep draught if necessary. The position of the\r\npaddlewheels was limited by that of the engine. Experience showed that\r\nwhere two paddles on each side were used their relative position had to\r\nbe adjusted nicely, otherwise the rear paddles, acting on accelerated\r\nwater, might actually be a disadvantage. Much difficulty was caused\r\nwith accidents to paddles; on the Mississippi the wheels were generally\r\nmounted astern, where they were protected from floating logs of timber.\r\nIn some cases double hulls were built, with the paddlewheels between\r\nthem; but owing to the rush of water on which they acted these wheels\r\nwere not very efficient.[141]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _COMET_ OF 1812\r\n\r\nFrom an oil painting in the South Kensington Museum]\r\n\r\nFulton had so far built steam vessels only for commercial traffic. He\r\nnow came near to revolutionizing naval warfare with them. In 1813, in\r\nthe middle of the war with this country, he presented to the President\r\nhis plan for a steam-propelled armoured warship for coast defence, a\r\ndesign of an invulnerable vessel of thirty guns, twin-hulled, with a\r\n120-horse-power engine in one hull, a boiler in the other, and a single\r\npaddlewheel in a space between the two; double-ended, flat-bottomed,\r\nand protected by a belt of solid timber 58 inches thick. Her armament\r\nwas to consist, in addition to thirty 32-pounders, of submarine guns\r\nor columbiads, carried at each end and firing 100-pound projectiles\r\nbelow the water-line. Named the _Demologos_, this monstrous vessel was\r\nnearly completed when the war came to an end. It was too late for use.\r\nThe treaty of Ghent being signed, interest in armaments immediately\r\nevaporated. Nevertheless, in the following year a trial of the\r\n_Demologos_ was carried out, which showed that a speed of five and a\r\nhalf knots could be attained with her. The _Demologos_, now renamed the\r\n_Fulton_, served no useful purpose. She was laid up in Brooklyn Navy\r\nYard, and many years elapsed before steam war vessels were built again\r\nin America.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn the meantime progress had been made on this side of the Atlantic.\r\nStimulated by Fulton’s commercial successes, Thomas Bell of Helensburgh\r\nbuilt in 1812 a vessel of thirty tons’ burden named the _Comet_,\r\nsuccessfully propelled by a 3-horse-power engine which worked a\r\npaddlewheel on each beam. This “handsome vessel” was intended to ply\r\nbetween Glasgow and Greenock, to sail by the power of wind, air, and\r\nsteam; and so it did, with fair financial success, with a square sail\r\ntriced to the top of a tall smoke-stack: the first passenger steamer\r\nto ply in European waters. Shortly afterwards steam vessels were built\r\nwhich pushed out to the open sea. In 1815 the _Argyle_, built on the\r\nClyde and renamed _Thames_ on being purchased by a London company, made\r\na voyage from Greenock to London which was the subject of much comment.\r\nOn making the Cornish coast after a stormy run south, boats were seen\r\nby those on board making towards her with all possible speed in the\r\nbelief that she was on fire! All the rocks commanding St. Ives were\r\ncovered with spectators as she entered the harbour, and the aspect of\r\nthe vessel, we are told, “appeared to occasion as much surprise amongst\r\nthe inhabitants, as the ships of Captain Cook must have produced on\r\nhis first appearance among the islands of the South Seas.” Next day\r\nthe _Thames_, her 9-foot paddlewheels driven by a 16-horse-power\r\nengine, reached Plymouth, where the crews of all the vessels in the\r\nSound filled the rigging, and the harbour-master was “struck with\r\nastonishment.” From Plymouth she steamed to Portsmouth, making the\r\npassage in twenty-three hours. So great was the swarm of vessels that\r\ncrowded round her, that the port admiral was asked to send a guard\r\nto preserve order. She steamed into harbour, with wind and tide, at\r\nfrom twelve to fourteen knots. A court-martial was sitting in the\r\n_Gladiator_ frigate, but the whole court except the president adjourned\r\nto inspect the strange visitor. Next day the port admiral sent off a\r\nguard and band; and soon afterwards he followed, accompanied by three\r\nadmirals, eighteen post captains, and a large number of ladies.[142]\r\n\r\nThe success of the _Thames_ led to the immediate building of other\r\nand larger steamers. In ’17 the son of James Watt purchased a 94-foot\r\nboat, the _Caledonia_, fitted her with 28-horse-power machinery\r\ndriving 10-foot paddlewheels, and for a pleasure trip proceeded in\r\nher up the Rhine as far as Coblentz. From this time onwards steam\r\nnavigation for commercial purposes progressed rapidly. In 1818 a\r\nsteamboat made regular voyages at sea; the _Rob Roy_, 90 tons, built\r\nby Denny of Dumbarton, with engines of 30 horse-power made by Napier,\r\nplied regularly between Holyhead and Dublin. In the same year the\r\n_Savannah_, a ship of 350 tons’ burden built and fitted with auxiliary\r\nsteam machinery at New York, crossed the Atlantic, partly under steam;\r\nher paddlewheels with their cast-iron frame and axletree successfully\r\nwithstanding heavy weather. In ’21 the postmaster-general introduced a\r\nsteam service for the mails at Dover and Holyhead; and in the following\r\nyear there were steamboats running between London and Leith, and other\r\nseaports. The experience of the Holyhead packets was of special value,\r\nas it proved that steam vessels could go to sea in weather which would\r\nkeep sailing vessels in harbour. Soon after this the question was\r\nraised of employing steam power to shorten the passage between England\r\nand the East, as well as of the navigation by steam of the great\r\nIndian rivers. Steam superseded sails in the government mail service\r\nbetween Falmouth, Malta and Corfu; everywhere commercial enterprise\r\nwas planning new lines of steamships and new possibilities of ocean\r\ntravel. In ’25 a barque belonging to Mr. Pelham, afterwards Earl of\r\nYarborough, was fitted with steam machinery as an auxiliary and made\r\nthe voyage to India. The plash of the paddlewheel was then heard for\r\nthe first time in Oriental waters.\r\n\r\nBy this time the great question of steam as applied to naval ends had\r\narrived to agitate the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nIn ’22 M. Paixhans discharged his revolutionary treatise at the\r\nFrench nation, advocating, with a wealth of argument, a navy of\r\nsteam-propelled warships armed with a few shell guns. Six years later\r\na warning echo reverberated through Whitehall. Captain Sir John Ross\r\npublished a volume on “Steam Navigation, with a System of the Naval\r\nTactics peculiar to it,” in which, though his name was not mentioned,\r\nthe arguments of M. Paixhans were set forth from an opposite point\r\nof view. The two books, starting with the same arguments, arrived\r\nat diametrically opposite conclusions. While Paixhans claimed that\r\nsteam power offered important advantages to France, the English\r\nwriter reached the gratifying conclusion that the change which steam\r\nwould effect in naval affairs might be rendered favourable to this\r\ncountry. For coast defence alone steam vessels would be invaluable. The\r\ncolonies would be safer from piracy. Passages, at present difficult\r\nor dangerous, would be made with speed and safety. Incidentally, an\r\nentirely new system of tactics would be evolved by the coming of steam;\r\neach ship-of-the-line would be escorted by a steam vessel, to tow her\r\ninto position, and concentration of force would be obtained by such\r\nmeans as, harnessing two steamers to one sailing ship, so as to tow one\r\nhalf of the fleet to a position of vantage over the enemy. After the\r\nmain action the steamers would themselves attack each other; and so on.\r\nBoth French and English writers agreed that there would be a reversion\r\nto the ancient warfare of the galleys; the steamer, whose paddlewheels\r\nlent themselves readily to a pivot gun armament and to great powers of\r\nmanœuvring, would always attack like a bull, facing the enemy, its bows\r\npresenting one or more large and well-protected cannon. Sir John Ross\r\nregarded the steamer, however, essentially as an auxiliary. M. Paixhans\r\ntook a more sanguine view. “At this moment,” he wrote in May, ’22,\r\n“the English admiralty are building two steam vessels, each of thirty\r\nhorsepower, one at Portsmouth and one at Plymouth, for tugging sailing\r\nships held up by contrary winds. They commence by being the servitors\r\nof the ships-of-the-line; but it is their destiny to become their\r\nmasters.”[143]\r\n\r\nBut the views of Sir John Ross did not find favour at the Admiralty.\r\nIn the presence of the revolution the authorities continued to steer\r\na policy of passive resistance to all changes and methods which might\r\nhave the effect of depreciating existing naval material; and Lord\r\nMelville himself penned, as a reply to the Colonial Office to a request\r\nfor a steam mail service between two Mediterranean ports, the principle\r\nwhich guided the Board. They felt it their bounden duty (he wrote in\r\n1828) to discourage, to the utmost of their ability, the employment\r\nof steam vessels, as they considered that the introduction of steam\r\nwas calculated to strike a fatal blow at the naval supremacy of the\r\nEmpire.[144][145]\r\n\r\nSo far, then, new methods of propulsion had not been greeted with\r\nenthusiasm. Yet to the First Lord himself was due the utilization of\r\nsteam for minor purposes in the navy. In spite of the non-success\r\nof Lord Stanhope’s experimental “ambi-navigator” ship in 1795, Lord\r\nMelville in 1815 caused the three-masted schooner _Congo_, designed\r\nfor a surveying expedition to the river of that name, to be fitted\r\nwith paddlewheels and machinery by Boulton and Watt, expressly to\r\ntry it in a ship-of-war. This machinery was so large and ponderous\r\nthat, not only did it usurp one-third of the space aboard the ship,\r\nbut brought her down so deep as only to give four knots through the\r\nwater. It was all removed again before she sailed, and sent to Chatham\r\nfor use in the dockyard. In the following year we find Mr. Brunel in\r\ncorrespondence with his lordship on the question of steam navigation.\r\nBrunel wrote quoting evidence to the effect that paddlewheels could be\r\nmade of sufficient strength and stiffness to withstand the violence of\r\nseas and gales; to which Lord Melville replied that the Board deemed\r\nit unnecessary to enter, at that time, into the question of steam\r\nnavigation generally, but desired his views on the application of steam\r\nto the towing of ships-of-war out of harbour against contrary winds\r\nand tides: which would be a matter of great advantage to his Majesty’s\r\nservice. Brunel answered recommending that the steamer _Regent_, plying\r\nbetween Margate and London, be chartered during the winter and employed\r\non this work, as a particular experiment.\r\n\r\n“From this period may be dated the introduction of steam navigation\r\ninto the English navy. Lord Melville was now so fully convinced of the\r\ngreat utility which the naval service would derive from it, that he\r\nordered a small vessel to be built at Deptford, by Mr. Oliver Lang, to\r\nbe called the _Comet_, of the burthen of 238 tons, and to have engines\r\nof 80 horse-power. She was built accordingly and ready for sea in\r\n1822.”[146] As a matter of fact, the first steamer actually brought\r\ninto H.M. service was the _Monkey_, built at Rotherhithe in 1821; and\r\nshe was followed by the more powerful _Sprightly_, built at Blackwall\r\nby Messrs. Wigram and Green in ’23. Gradually the use of these\r\npaddlewheel tugs extended, their tonnage and horse-power increased, and\r\nthe Surveyor of the Navy and his master shipwrights began to divert\r\ntheir talents to a consideration of the small steamers.\r\n\r\nFor the reason stated by Lord Melville, steamers were at this time\r\ntolerated only for towing and other subsidiary duties; authority poured\r\ncold water on the idea of utilizing them as ships-of-war; and if steam\r\ncould have been dispensed with altogether, everyone would have been the\r\nbetter pleased.\r\n\r\nEven at this period the idea of using manual labour, applied in an\r\neffective manner, for towing and bringing into position sailing\r\nwarships had not been altogether abandoned. In 1802 the transport\r\n_Doncaster_ had been propelled at a slow speed in Malta harbour by the\r\ninvention of a Mr. Shorter: a screw propeller rigged over the stern.\r\nIn 1820 experiments were made at Portsmouth with paddlewheels manually\r\nworked, and in ’29 Captain C. Napier took his ship _Galatea_ out of\r\nPortsmouth Harbour by use of paddlewheels geared to winches which\r\nwere worked by the crew. One hundred and thirty men were able to give\r\nher a speed of 2½ knots, while the full crew of a hundred and ninety\r\nproduced a speed of three. After this doubtful success another trial\r\nwas held--a race between the _Galatea_, propelled by paddles, and\r\nthe _Briton_, towed by boats--which _Galatea_ won. Captain Napier’s\r\npaddlewheels afterwards did good work for his ship in other quarters\r\nof the world.[147] Nothing resulted, however, from his initiative\r\nin this connection; only was emphasized the enormous superiority of\r\nsteam-propelled vessels as tugs, in which capacity they had already\r\nmade their appearance, and from which they were destined to evolve, in\r\nthe next decade, into fighting vessels of considerable force.\r\n\r\nBy 1830 steam navigation had made significant strides along the\r\nlines of commercial development. In that year a service of steam\r\nmail boats started to run at regular intervals between Falmouth and\r\nCorfu, covering the distance in about one-fourth of the time which\r\nhad been taken by the sailing packets; a Dutch government steamer,\r\nthe _Curaçoa_, built in England, had since ’27 been running between\r\nHolland and the East Indies; and already the Indian Government had\r\nbuilt an armed steamer, designed as the forerunner of others which were\r\nto connect Bombay with Suez and thus to place India in more direct\r\ncommunication with England.\r\n\r\nThe navy was still represented only by paddle-tugs. With a change\r\nof administration, however, came a change in Admiralty policy. The\r\nnew Board took a distinctly progressive view. It was agreed that,\r\nif foreign powers initiated the building of steam war-vessels, this\r\ncountry must build as well, and not only as well but better: a policy\r\ntersely summed up by Admiral Sir T. M. Hardy in his saying, “Happen\r\nwhat will, England must take the lead.” Certain objections to steam\r\nvessels as naval units which had hitherto held a vogue were now seen\r\nto be ill-founded or baseless. In particular it was discovered, not\r\nwithout surprise to many, that steamers could be manœuvred without\r\ndifficulty. A paddlewheel steamer, the _Medea_, gained her commander\r\nconsiderable credit from the skill with which she was navigated from\r\nthe Thames into the basin at Woolwich dockyard, which proved that\r\nsteamers could be steered and manœuvred better than sailing ships.\r\nIn ’33 the construction of steamers was placed in the hands of the\r\nSurveyor.[148]\r\n\r\nBut small progress was made. One reason alleged was that the shape of\r\nhull which the Surveyor had made peculiarly his own was ill-adapted for\r\nsteam machinery. “Nothing more unpropitious,” observed a later writer,\r\n“for Sir William Symond’s mode of construction than the introduction of\r\nsteam can be conceived. His sharp bottoms were the very worst possible\r\nfor the reception of engines; his broad beam and short length the most\r\nunfavourable qualities that could be devised for steam propulsion. As\r\nmuch as he could, he adhered to his principles.... Rather than yield\r\nto the demands of the new power, he sacrificed the armaments of his\r\nvessels, kept down the size of their engines, and recklessly exposed\r\nthe machinery to shot should they go into action.”[149] There doubtless\r\nwas something in this criticism. And yet, as we have seen, experience\r\nin America led to a form of hull for paddle steamers in many respects\r\napproaching that condemned as being favoured by the Surveyor!\r\n\r\nAnother and more valid reason for the slow progress made lay in the\r\ninherent unsuitability of the paddlewheel steamer as a substitute\r\nfor the large sailing warship. Not only did the paddlewheels offer a\r\nlarge and vulnerable surface to destruction by enemy shot, but the\r\nwheels and their machinery could not be embodied in a ship design\r\nwithout interference with its sails and sailing qualities and, still\r\nmore, without serious sacrifice of broadside armament. The machinery\r\nmonopolized a large section of the midship space, the huge wheels\r\ncovered the sides and interfered with the training of those guns for\r\nwhich room remained. The problem of arming steam-vessels was novel and\r\ndifficult of solution. The guns must be few and therefore powerful.\r\nHence it appeared that paddlewheel steamers, notwithstanding the\r\nadvantages they possessed of speed and certainty of motion, could only\r\nsustain a small concentrated armament, consisting of the heaviest\r\nand most powerful ordnance: guns of large calibre, which possessed\r\nlarge power of offence at ranges where the broadside cannon would be\r\ndeprived of much of their efficiency. Hence in ’31 a 10-inch shell gun\r\nof 84 hundredweight was expressly designed and cast for this purpose;\r\nand all the classes of steamers in early use in the navy were armed\r\nwith it until, in ’41, it was displaced by the 68-pounder pivot gun,\r\nwhich then became the principal pivot gun of the service. Thus the\r\ndevelopment of paddlewheel machinery reacted on the development of\r\nartillery. The steamer was a stimulus to the development of large\r\nordnance worked on the pivot system. And this form of armament in\r\nturn influenced the form of the ship. The main weights--those of the\r\npropelling machinery--were already concentrated in the waist of the\r\nvessel, and it was now possible so to place the few pivot guns that the\r\nends of the vessel were left very lightly loaded. Thus it was possible\r\nto give unprecedentedly fine lines to the new steamers, a sharp and\r\nlengthened bow and a well-tapered run: an improved form of body by\r\nthe use of which high speeds were obtained. In the case of commercial\r\nsteamships the advantages of fine lines had already been recognized,\r\nand their designers had been free to give them a form which would allow\r\nof a high speed being attained; but in the case of war vessels designed\r\nto carry a broadside armament the limitations imposed by the heavily\r\nweighted ends had hitherto prevented other than bluff bows and sterns\r\nbeing given them. But now the subject of ship form came under general\r\nconsideration, and the new conditions led to a more serious study of\r\nthe laws governing the motion of bodies through water.\r\n\r\nYear after year the size of steamers grew.[150] And as with size the\r\ncost of construction and maintenance increased, the question pressed\r\nitself more and more clearly--what was the naval utility of such\r\nexpensive and lightly armed vessels? Numerous attempts were made to\r\nproduce a form of paddlewheel steamer which would carry a broadside\r\narmament comparable with that which a sailing vessel of the same\r\nburthen would bear. In 1843 the _Penelope_, 46 guns, was cut in\r\nhalves at Chatham and lengthened by the addition of about 65 feet, in\r\nwhich space engines of 650 horse-power were installed. But the extra\r\ndisplacement failed to compensate for the weight of the machinery;\r\nthe altered vessel drew more water than had been anticipated and,\r\nthough various alterations were made to minimize the effects of this,\r\nthe experiment was not a success and was not repeated. In ’45 a steam\r\nfrigate called the _Odin_ was built by order of the Board. “The results\r\naimed at in constructing this ship were--capability of carrying\r\nbroadside armament; diminished rolling, in comparison with any war\r\nsteamers then built; and less draught of water in relation to the size.\r\nThese objects were accomplished; but as the position of the machinery\r\nand boilers is partially above the water-line, and the propellers\r\nare exposed to danger in broadside fighting, the ship is necessarily\r\nimperfect in these two conditions, as well as in the position of the\r\nsails; for in this case the proper place of the mainmast was occupied\r\nby the boilers, and consequently the centre of effort of the wind on\r\nthe sails is in a wrong place.”[151] In the same year the _Sidon_ was\r\nlaid down, the design being on the lines of the _Odin_ but modified in\r\naccordance with the ideas of Sir Charles Napier: with greater depth of\r\nhold and with machinery below the water-line. Iron tanks were placed in\r\nthe hold for carrying the coals; by filling these with water when empty\r\nthe steamer was kept at a more or less constant draught, a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance to the efficient working of the paddlewheels.\r\nIn other respects, however, the _Sidon_ was unsatisfactory. She was so\r\ncrank that the addition of ballast and a modification of her armament\r\nwere necessary. Her engines were cramped, her boilers of insufficient\r\npower and of unsuitable design, and her coal capacity too small to give\r\nher a useful radius of action. For the attainment of all the properties\r\nspecified it was subsequently calculated and shown that a much larger\r\ndisplacement was necessary. Just as Fitch had discovered and Fulton\r\nhad discerned, increase in scale reduced many of the difficulties\r\nencountered in designing heavily weighted steam vessels. Hence the\r\nsuccess of the _Terrible_. In the case of the _Terrible_, a large\r\npaddlewheel frigate of 1,850 tons and 800 horse-power built in 1845, it\r\nwas clear that an increase of size had given a partial solution to the\r\nproblem of designing a war-vessel with heavy and spacious propelling\r\nmachinery, with adequate armament, and with full sail-power and all the\r\nproperties of a sailing ship.\r\n\r\nStill the steam war-vessel was not satisfactory. Her machinery usurped\r\nthe weight and space required for armament, her cumbrous paddlewheels\r\nwere far too exposed to damage by shot or shell. And how to surmount\r\nthese difficulties and reconcile the conflicting requirements of\r\nartillery and motive power, was a problem which cost the country years\r\nof unsuccessful experiments and millions of money. “It was,” said\r\nDahlgren, “the riddle of the day.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe problem was solved by the adoption of the screw propeller.\r\n\r\nSince Archimedes’ day the screw had been known in the form of a pump,\r\nand in two familiar objects--the smoke-jack and the windmill--the\r\nprinciple of the driven screw had been for centuries widely employed.\r\nIn connection with ship propulsion the screw appears to have been tried\r\nat an early date, like the Marquis of Worcester’s water-wheel, in the\r\nform of a mill. Among the machines and inventions approved by the\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences of Paris between the years 1727 and 1731 is\r\none described as a screw, suspended in a framework between two boats,\r\nwhich when acted upon by the current was intended to warp the vessels\r\nupstream, the motion of the screw being transmitted to a winch barrel\r\non which a tow-rope was wound. But so far as is known no attempt had\r\nbeen made at this date to use the screw directly as a propeller. In\r\n1768 its use in this form was suggested in a work entitled _Théorie de\r\nla Vis d’Archimede_.[152] And shortly after, as we have already seen,\r\nBramah in England and Bushnell in America had patented, and the latter\r\nhad actually put into use, the screw as a means of propelling vessels\r\nthrough water. We have seen, too, that Fulton successfully adapted\r\nthe screw propeller, on a small scale, in one of his experimental\r\nsteamboats. Sporadic attempts were made in the early days of the\r\nnineteenth century both in this country and in America to drive ships\r\nby means of screws, both manually and by the medium of steam, some of\r\nwhich were attended with a certain measure of success.[153] Yet some\r\ntime was to elapse before screw propulsion gained recognition. Doubt\r\nas to the efficiency of a screw’s action, ignorance as to the shape\r\nof the vessel required and as to the best position for the propeller,\r\ndifficulty in accommodating the early long-stroke steam engine to drive\r\ndirect an under-water propeller shaft; inertia, prejudice and vested\r\ninterest, all seem to have played a part in delaying the adoption of\r\nwhat, when it did come, was acknowledged to be the only suitable form\r\nof steam propulsion for war vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETTIT SMITH’S PROPELLER]\r\n\r\nIn 1825 a premium was offered by the Admiralty for the best plan\r\nof propelling vessels without paddlewheels; and a plan proposed by\r\nCommander S. Brown, R.N., was deemed sufficiently promising for trial:\r\na two-bladed screw propeller placed at the bow of a vessel and actuated\r\nby a 12-horsepower engine. But though exhibiting advantages this form\r\nof the invention did not survive.\r\n\r\nThe history of the screw-propeller may be said to date from 1836. In\r\nthat year two capable inventors obtained patents: Mr. Francis Pettit\r\nSmith and Captain Ericsson. So little attention had, up to that time,\r\nbeen given to the subject that the two proposals “were presented to the\r\npublic in the character of novelties, and as such they were regarded\r\nby the few who had curiosity enough to look at them.” Smith’s patents\r\nwere for the application of the screw to propel steam vessels by\r\nfixing it in a recess or open space formed in the deadwood; and, says\r\nFincham, “the striking and peculiar merit of Mr. Smith’s plan appears\r\nto consist, _chiefly_, in his having chosen the right position for it\r\nto work in.” Trials were carried out with Smith’s propeller in a 6-ton\r\nboat on the City and Paddington canal, and then between Blackwall and\r\nFolkestone, with encouraging success; the boat, encountering heavy\r\nweather off the Foreland, demonstrated the advantage derived from\r\nthe absence of paddlewheels, and showed the new form of propelling\r\nmachinery to place no limitations on her qualities as a sailing vessel.\r\nShe returned to Blackwall, having run over 400 miles at a mean speed of\r\n8 knots.\r\n\r\nCaptain Ericsson, a Swedish army officer who had come to London and\r\nestablished himself as a civil engineer, had a contemporary success\r\nwith a boat fitted with two large-bladed propellers each 5 feet 3\r\ninches in diameter. So successful was he, indeed, that he invited the\r\nBoard of Admiralty to take a trip in tow of his novel craft; a trip\r\nwhich had important and unexpected results on the subsequent progress\r\nof steam navigation. One summer day in ’37 the Admiralty barge, in\r\nwhich were the Surveyor and three other members of the Board, was towed\r\nby Ericsson’s screw steamer from Somerset House to Limehouse and back\r\nat a speed of 10 knots. The demonstration was a complete success, and\r\nthe inventor anticipated some further patronage of his invention. But\r\nto his chagrin nothing was asked of him, and to his amazement he was\r\nsubsequently informed that the proposal to propel warships by means\r\nof a screw had been pronounced impracticable. Never, perhaps, in the\r\nwhole history of mechanical progress has so signally wrong a decision\r\nbeen made, never has expert opinion been so mistaken. Engineers and\r\nshipbuilders all failed to realize the possibilities of the screw.\r\nThe naval authorities who, in the face of their personal experience,\r\ndismissed the project as impracticable (owing to some anticipated\r\ndifficulties in steering ships fitted with screws) merely expressed the\r\nunanimous opinion of the time. “The engineering corps of the empire\r\nwere arrayed in opposition to it, alleging that it was constructed on\r\nerroneous principles, and full of practical defects, and regarding\r\nits failure as too certain to authorize any speculations even of\r\nits success. The plan was specially submitted to many distinguished\r\nengineers, and was publicly discussed in the scientific journals; and\r\nthere was no one but the inventor who refused to acquiesce in the truth\r\nof the numerous demonstrations, proving the vast loss of mechanical\r\npower which must attend this proposed substitute for the old-fashioned\r\npaddlewheel.”[154] Yet in five years’ time steamers designed for\r\npaddlewheels were being converted to carry screws, and a great\r\nscrew-propelled liner, the _Great Britain_, had been launched for the\r\nAtlantic traffic!\r\n\r\nIt was in America, we have seen, that progress in steam navigation\r\nwas of the greatest interest to the public, and it was by Americans\r\nthat the disabilities of the paddlewheel were most keenly appreciated.\r\nTwo witnesses of the trial of Ericsson’s boat saw and admitted the\r\nadvantages of the new method: Mr. Ogden, an engineer who had been U.S.\r\nconsul at Liverpool for some years, and Captain Stockton, U.S.N. The\r\nlatter appreciated the military advantages of screw propulsion and was\r\nsoon its enthusiastic advocate. Under his influence and encouragement\r\nEricsson threw up his engagements in London and went to America. “We’ll\r\nmake your name ring on the Delaware,” said Captain Stockton to him at a\r\ndinner in his honour given at Greenwich. The prediction was fulfilled.\r\nIn the course of time Ericsson saw his propeller applied on a large\r\nscale, not only to mercantile craft but in the American navy. Early in\r\n’37 Captain Stockton had ordered an iron vessel to be built by Messrs.\r\nLaird, of Birkenhead, and fitted with a screw. In the following year\r\nshe was launched, and in the spring of ’40, after giving demonstration\r\non the Thames of the great towing power of her propeller, she left for\r\nAmerica for service as a tug on the big rivers. On this work one of the\r\ngreat advantages of the screw was realized: the immunity with which the\r\nscrew vessel could work in drift ice, when paddlewheel steamers were\r\nperforce laid up.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, fortunately, Pettit Smith’s successes had not been\r\nwithout their effect on opinion in this country. A company was formed\r\nto exploit the screw, and a vessel, the _Archimedes_, was built amid\r\na strange chorus of detraction, opposition and ridicule. She made her\r\ntrials in October, ’39. Her propeller was at first in the form of a\r\ncomplete convolution of a helical screw of 8-foot pitch and of 5 foot 9\r\ninches diameter; but subsequently this blade was replaced by two, each\r\nof which formed half a convolution, with the two halves set at right\r\nangles to one another. Comparative trials were ordered by the Admiralty\r\nin the following year to test the merits of the _Archimedes’_ screw as\r\ncompared with the ordinary paddlewheels applied to her Majesty’s mail\r\npackets on the Dover station. The results were inconclusive.[155] But\r\na subsequent voyage round the coasts of Great Britain, during which\r\nthe machinery of the _Archimedes_ was laid open to the inspection of\r\nthe general public, and a later voyage from Plymouth to Oporto which\r\nrecreated a new record for a steam passage, went far to establish in\r\npublic estimation the merits of the new propeller. But generally the\r\ninvention was discouraged. Prejudice and vested interests, rather than\r\na reasoned conservation, seem to have operated to oppose its progress.\r\n“A striking instance of prevailing disinclination to the screw\r\npropeller was shown on the issue of a new edition of the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_, in which the article on steam navigation contained no\r\nnotice whatever of the subject.”\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all prepossessions against it the screw had won a\r\ndecisive victory over its rival. So striking were the results recorded\r\nby the _Archimedes_, that a decision was made in December, 1840, to\r\nchange the _Great Britain_, an Atlantic liner then under construction,\r\nfrom paddlewheel to screw propulsion. In two ways she was a gigantic\r\nexperiment: she was the first large ship to be built of iron, and it\r\nwas now proposed to fit her with a screw. Mr. Brunel took all the\r\nresponsibility for advising the adoption of both these revolutionary\r\nfeatures; the result was a splendid testimony to his scientific\r\njudgment, boldness of enterprise, and “confident reliance on deductions\r\nfrom facts ascertained on a small scale.”\r\n\r\nBefore the completion of the _Great Britain_ the Admiralty had\r\ninitiated experiments which were to furnish important information as\r\nto the power and efficiency of the screw propeller in its various\r\nforms, and to settle beyond cavil the question of its superiority over\r\nthe paddlewheel for the propulsion of warships. The sloop _Rattler_,\r\n888 tons and 200 horsepower, was fitted with screw machinery. Several\r\nforms of screw were tried during the winter of 1843-4. First the\r\nscrew as used in the _Archimedes_ was fitted: a screw of 9-foot\r\ndiameter, 11-foot pitch, and of 5½ feet length, consisting of two\r\nhalf-convolutions of a blade upon its axis. Then a screw was tried\r\nof the same diameter and pitch but of only 4-foot length; and then\r\nthe length was again reduced to 3 feet. The effect of cutting down\r\nthe length was to give an increase of efficiency.[156] The screw was\r\nagain shortened by 2 feet, and finally to 1 foot 3 inches; with each\r\nreduction in length the slip diminished and the propulsive efficiency\r\nincreased. Various other forms of screws were tried, and it was shown\r\nthat Pettit Smith’s short two-bladed propeller was on the whole the\r\nmost efficient.\r\n\r\nThe best form of screw having been determined, it still remained to\r\ncompare the screw propeller with the paddlewheel. Accordingly the\r\n_Alecto_, a paddlewheel sloop of similar lines to the _Rattler_, was\r\nselected as the protagonist of the older form of propulsion, while\r\nthe _Rattler_ herself represented the screw. Naval opinion was still\r\ncompletely divided on the great question, while in the competing sloops\r\nthe utmost emulation existed, each captain advocating his own type of\r\npropeller. The speed trials took place, and showed the _Rattler_ to\r\nhave an undoubted advantage. The paddlewheel, however, laid claim to\r\na superiority in towing power. So a further competition was ordered,\r\nas realistic as any, perhaps, in the history of applied science:\r\nnothing less than a tug-of-war between Paddle and Screw, those two\r\ncontending forms of steam propulsion! Lashed stern to stern and both\r\nsteaming ahead full power, one evening in the spring of ’45 the two\r\nsteamers struggled for mastery. And as _Rattler_ slowly but surely\r\npulled over _Alecto_, the question which had been for years so hotly\r\ndebated was settled; the superiority of the screw was demonstrated.\r\nWith the adoption of the screw the problem of disposing the armament\r\nwas settled. The broadsides and the spaces between decks were once\r\nmore free to the guns along the entire length; moreover the action of\r\nthe screw was in complete harmony with that of the sails. With the\r\nscrew as an auxiliary to sail power, and subsequently with the screw\r\nas sole means of propulsion, a change came over the character of the\r\npivot armament. Whereas with the paddlewheel the pivot gun was the\r\nchief means of offence, when the screw was introduced the broadside\r\nwas restored, and though the heavy pivot guns were retained (steam and\r\nthe pivot gun had become associated ideas), yet by their comparatively\r\nlimited numbers they became a subordinate element in the total armament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _RATTLER_ VERSUS _ALECTO_\r\n\r\nFrom an aquatint in the South Kensington Museum]\r\n\r\nExternal affairs now lent a spur to screw propulsion. In ’44 the\r\nFrench navy came under the reforming power of the ambitious Prince de\r\nJoinville, and from this year onwards the attitude of France to this\r\ncountry became increasingly hostile and menacing. The thoughts of\r\nthe French were turned toward their navy. No sooner had de Joinville\r\nbeen placed in command than schemes of invasion were bruited in this\r\ncountry; and the public viewed with some alarm the altered problems of\r\ndefence imposed on our fleets by the presence in the enemy’s ports of a\r\nsteam-propelled navy. Sanguine French patriots sought to profit by the\r\nadvent of the new power. A pamphlet appeared in Paris claiming to prove\r\nthat the establishment of steam navigation afforded France the very\r\nmeans by which she could regain her former level of naval strength. The\r\nwriter, using the same arguments as Colonel Paixhans had used in ’22,\r\nreviewed the effect of steam power on the rival navies, and pointed to\r\nthe Duke of Wellington’s warnings in parliament of the defencelessness\r\nof the English coasts and to his statement that if Napoleon had\r\npossessed steam power he would have achieved invasion. These cries of\r\nalarm, said the writer, should trace for France her line of policy. She\r\nshould emulate the wise development of steam propulsion as practised\r\nby Great Britain. “We think, England acts; we discuss theories, she\r\npursues application. She creates with activity a redoubtable steam\r\nforce and reduces the number of her sailing ships, whose impotence\r\nshe recognizes.... Sailing vessels have lost their main power; the\r\nemployment of steamers has reduced them to the subaltern position\r\nof the siege artillery in a land army.” The writer praised English\r\npolicy in the matter of steam development: its wise caution, its\r\nreasoned continuity. There had admittedly been some costly deceptions.\r\nNevertheless the method was to be commended, and France should proceed\r\nin a similar manner: by a succession of sample units while steam was\r\nstill in the experimental stage, by far-sighted single strides, and\r\nthen by bold and rapid construction of a steam navy which would compete\r\non more even terms with that of her hereditary rival.[157]\r\n\r\nFaced with the probability that our rivals would pursue some such\r\nprogressive and challenging policy as outlined by the pamphleteer, the\r\nAdmiralty acted rapidly. Before the _Rattler_ trials were complete a\r\ndecision was made favourable to the screw propeller, and an order was\r\nmade for its wide application to warships built and building. It was\r\nresolved, on the advice of Sir Charles Napier, that the screw should\r\nbe regarded solely as an auxiliary to, and in no way as in competition\r\nwith, sail power. The _Arrogant_ was laid down, the first frigate\r\nbuilt for auxiliary steam power; and screws driven by engines of small\r\nhorse-power were subsequently fitted to other ships with varying\r\ndegrees of success.\r\n\r\nTwo important features were specified for all: the machinery was\r\nrequired to be wholly below the water-line, and the screw had to\r\nbe unshippable. Engines were now required for Block Ships and for\r\nsea-going vessels. So the principal engineers of the country were\r\ncalled together and were asked to produce engines in accordance with\r\nthe bare requirements given them. A variety of designs resulted. From\r\nthe experience obtained with this machinery two important conclusions\r\nwere quickly drawn: firstly, that gearing might be altogether dispensed\r\nwith; secondly, that no complex contrivance was necessary for altering\r\nthe pitch to enable engines to work advantageously under varying\r\nconditions, the efficiency of the screw varying very little whether\r\npart of the ship’s velocity were due to sail power or whether it were\r\nwholly due to the screw.[158]\r\n\r\nAnd here it may not be amiss to note, in relation to a nation’s\r\nfighting power, the significant position assumed by naval material.\r\nIn land warfare a rude measure of force could always be obtained by\r\na mere counting of heads. At sea man was in future to act, almost\r\nentirely, through the medium of the machine.\r\n\r\nHowever we may have deserved the eulogy of the French writer in\r\nrespect of developing the paddlewheel war steamer, the development\r\nof screw propulsion in the next decade was marked by a succession of\r\nfailures and a large outlay of money on useless conversions and on new\r\nconstruction of poor fighting value, most of which could have been\r\navoided. Had our methods been less tentative and more truly scientific\r\nthe gain would have been undoubtedly very great; we should have laid\r\nour plans on a firmer basis and arrived at our end, full screw power,\r\nby a far less circuitous route than that actually taken. In this\r\nrespect France had the advantage of us.\r\n\r\nAlthough a decision had been made to maintain the full sail power of\r\nour ships and install screw machinery only as an auxiliary motive\r\npower, attempts were naturally made to augment so far as possible the\r\npower exerted by the screw; and within a short time new ships were\r\nbeing fitted with machinery of high power, in an endeavour to make the\r\nscrew a primary means of propulsion. The results were disappointing. As\r\nthe power increased difficulties thickened. The weight of the machinery\r\ngrew to be excessive, the economy of the comparatively fast-running and\r\nshort-stroke engines proved to be low, and the propulsive efficiency of\r\nthe screws themselves grew unaccountably smaller and smaller. So poor\r\nwere the results obtained, indeed, that in the case of a certain ship\r\nit was demonstrated that, by taking out the high-power machinery and\r\nsubstituting smaller engines an actual gain in speed was obtained, with\r\nthe reduced displacement. The first screw ship in which an attempt was\r\nmade to obtain full power with the screw was the _Dauntless_, of 1846.\r\nAlthough a frigate of beautiful lines she was considered a comparative\r\nfailure. It was agreed that, equipped with paddlewheels and armed with\r\nguns of larger calibre, she would have constituted a faster and more\r\npowerful warship than, with her 580-horse-power engines, her 10 knots\r\nof speed, and her 32-pounder guns, she actually was.\r\n\r\nPart of the trouble was due to the unsuitability of our ships’ lines\r\nfor screw propulsion. It has already been noted that, owing to the\r\ncarriage of heavy weights at their extremities, war vessels were always\r\ngiven very full bows and sterns. In the case of the _Rattler_, whose\r\nrecords served as a criterion for later designs of screw ships, the\r\nlines of the stern were unusually fine: partly, no doubt, in imitation\r\nof the _Archimedes_. Also, since it had been necessary to allow\r\nspace enough for a long screw to be carried (a screw of a complete\r\nconvolution was thought possible) the _Rattler’s_ short screw as\r\nfinally adopted worked at some distance aft of the deadwood, and thus\r\nsuffered no retarding influence from it when under way. But in the case\r\nof later ships these advantages did not obtain. They were built with\r\nthe usual “square tuck,” a bluff form of stern which prevented a free\r\nflow of water into the space ahead of the propeller and thus detracted\r\nfrom its efficiency. It was not appreciated at this time that, for\r\nefficient action, the screw propeller demands to be supplied with a\r\nbody of unbroken, non-eddying water for it to act upon, which with the\r\nsquare-cut stern is not obtained. At low speeds, and in the ship to\r\nwhich the screw was fitted as an auxiliary, the effect of the square\r\ntuck was not marked. But as power and speed increased its effect became\r\nmore and more evident; the increase in power gave no proportionate\r\nincrease in speed; and many, ignorant of the cause, surmised that there\r\nwas a limit to the power which could be transmitted by a screw and that\r\nthis limit had already been reached. The inefficiency of the square\r\ntuck was exposed by trials carried out in H.M.S. _Dwarf_ at Chatham. As\r\na result of these, future new and converted ships were given as fine a\r\nstern as possible.\r\n\r\nFor several years, however, the policy of the Admiralty remained the\r\nsame: the screw was regarded solely as an auxiliary. The French, on the\r\nother hand, took a less compromising line of action. After waiting for\r\nsome time and watching our long series of experiments, they convened\r\nin 1849 a grand _Enquête Parliamentaire_: a commission which, primed\r\nwith the latest information as to British naval material, was to\r\ndecide on what basis of size, number, armament and means of propulsion\r\nfuture French warships should be built. For two years the commission\r\nsat sifting evidence. And then it recommended screw propulsion of the\r\nhighest power for all new ships, as well as the conversion of some\r\nexisting classes to auxiliary screw power. England had fitted her\r\nships with screws capable of giving them small speed; France must fit\r\nhers with screws of greater power. Speed, said the commission, is\r\nan element of power. Superior speed is the only means by which the\r\nEnglish can be fought with a good chance of success. Sails must be\r\nsecondary, therefore, and full reliance must be placed on the screw.\r\nThe recommendations of the commission were duly realized. In the\r\nfollowing years a powerful force of fast screw battleships, frigates,\r\ntransports, and despatch boats was constructed which by ’58 had brought\r\nthe aggregate of the horse-power of the French fleet almost to a level\r\nwith that of England.\r\n\r\nWhen the Crimean War brought the two navies together as allies in\r\n’54 the full effect of the new policy of the French had not yet been\r\nmade apparent. Some apprehension existed in this country as to the\r\nadequacy and efficiency of our navy, when compared directly with that\r\nof France. But from then onwards this country became aware of the\r\nincreasing hostility of the French public and government; speeches\r\nwere made, and letters appeared in the press of both countries, which\r\ntended to fan the flames of fear and suspicion.[159] It was not till\r\n’58, however, that general attention was drawn to the great strides\r\nwhich the French navy had made in recent years, and to the skilful\r\nway in which its position, relative to that of its great rival, had\r\nbeen improved. An article entitled “The Navies of England and France”\r\nappeared in the _Conversations Lexicon_ of Leipsic, and caused a great\r\nsensation. Reprinted in book form, with a long analysis and with a\r\nmass of information about the French, English and other navies and\r\narsenals,[160] this notorious article brought apprehension to a head.\r\nThough written by no friendly critic, it was in most respects an\r\naccurate presentment of the respective navies and of their condition.\r\nThe analysis of Hans Busk, while ostensibly exposing its bias and its\r\ninaccuracies, in effect confirmed the main contentions of the German\r\narticle; in addition his book gave in spectacular columns a summary of\r\nthe units of the rival navies, which gave food for thought. The article\r\nitself professed to show how much France had benefited by the bold\r\nand scientific manner in which she had handled the problem of naval\r\nconstruction since the coming of steam. Other factors were discussed,\r\nthe forms of ships, the Paixhans system of armament, problems of\r\nmanning and of education; but the factor which had caused the greatest\r\naccession of strength to France, by her wise divergence from the\r\nEnglish policy, was (according to the critic) steam propulsion. In the\r\ncase of paddlewheel steamers England, by her unscientific and ruinous\r\nexperiments, had squandered millions of money and produced a series of\r\ncrank and inefficient war vessels. In the case of screw ships England’s\r\nwaste of exertions and money was even more surprising; the building of\r\nnew ships and the conversion of others was carried out at an enormous\r\ncost with many galling disappointments. The French, on the other hand,\r\ntook longer to consider the principle of the screw, but then, when\r\ntheir more scientific constructors had completed their investigations\r\nand analysed the new power, they acted thoroughly and without delay.\r\nFrom all of which the German critic inferred that England had good\r\nreason to watch with anxious eye the significant development of\r\nstrength on the part of her neighbours across the Channel. “We\r\nmust pronounce,” he concluded, “that with a nearly equal amount of\r\n_matériel_, the French navy surpasses the English in capacity and in\r\ncommand of men. France need feel no hesitation in placing herself in\r\ncomparison with England.... Never was the policy of England so yielding\r\nand considerate towards France as at the present day. And then, with\r\nrespect to the vexed question of the invasion, it is certain that\r\nNapoleon III has the means of effecting it with greater ease and far\r\ngreater chance of success than his uncle.”\r\n\r\nThe means was steam power. But the much-talked-of invasion was never\r\nto be attempted. Other events intervened, other developments took\r\nplace, which reduced the tension between the two great naval powers and\r\nremoved for an indefinite time the danger, which the Leipsic article\r\ndisinterestedly pointed out, of war under novel and unprecedentedly\r\nterrible conditions: with shell guns and wooden unarmoured steam\r\nwarships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE IRONCLAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1860 marks the most dramatic, swift, and far-reaching change\r\nwhich has ever befallen war material: the supersession of the wooden\r\nship-of-the-line by the modern battleship in its earliest form. What\r\nwere the causes, suddenly realized or acknowledged, which impelled this\r\nrevolutionary change, and what were the circumstances which moulded\r\nthe new form of naval construction? This final chapter will attempt to\r\nshow. Before descending to a detailed examination of this evolution,\r\nhowever, let us trace out the most striking features of the transition;\r\ntheir measure of accuracy can be estimated by the light of the\r\nsubsequent narration of progress.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, we remark that, potentially, from the time\r\nwhen shell-throwing ordnance was introduced into the French, and then\r\nas a counter-measure into our own fleet, unarmoured wooden ships were\r\ndoomed. Strange it seems that so long a time elapsed before this fact\r\nwas realized; though it is true that with spherical shells and small\r\nexplosive charges the destructive effects of shell fire were not\r\ngreatly superior to those of solid shot, that fuzes were unreliable,\r\nthat trials of artillery against material were rarely resorted to,\r\nand that, moreover, no opportunity occurred between 1822 and the\r\noutbreak of the Crimean War to demonstrate in actual sea-fighting such\r\nsuperiority as actually existed. Implicit trust was placed in our\r\nfine sailing ships. So long as solid shot were used, indeed, these\r\ntimber-built ships were admirably suited for the line of battle;\r\nas size and strength increased and as our methods of construction\r\nimproved the ship gained an increasing advantage over the gun, defence\r\nincreasingly mastered attack, to such a degree that by the end of the\r\nlong wars with France the ship-of-the-line had become almost unsinkable\r\nby gun-fire. But so soon as shell guns were established--even with\r\nspherical shells fired from smooth-bore ordnance--wooden ships\r\nloomed easy targets for destruction. For a long time this disquieting\r\nconclusion was ignored or boldly denied; expert opinion with sagacity\r\nturned a blind eye to the portentous evidence presented to it of the\r\npower of shell. War came, but even then the full possibilities of shell\r\nfire were not developed. Enough proof was given, however, to show that\r\nin the special circumstances of that war unarmoured ships were of small\r\nvalue against shell fire. Armour was accordingly requisitioned, and,\r\nsome few years after the war, was applied to seagoing warships.\r\n\r\nAnother development now took place. At this period when disruptive and\r\nincendiary shell was proving itself a more powerful agent than solid\r\nshot of equal size, both shell and shot gained an enhanced value from\r\nthe application of rifling to ordnance; moreover, ordnance itself was\r\ndeveloping so quickly that each year saw an appreciable increase in\r\nthe unit of artillery force. This variation in the unit profoundly\r\naffected naval architecture. No longer was there a unit of standard\r\nand unchanging value, which, when multiplied by a certain number,\r\nconveyed a measure of a ship’s offensive power. No longer was the size\r\nof a ship a rough measure of its fighting strength; by concentrating\r\npower in a few guns, offensive strength could be correspondingly\r\nconcentrated, if desired, in a small vessel. On the other hand, in\r\nview of the sudden accession of offensive strength, the defensive\r\ncapacities of a ship remaining as before, it was now true that size had\r\nbecome an element of danger, diminutiveness of safety. Hence warships,\r\nwhich had for centuries triumphed in the moral and physical effect of\r\ntheir height and size, suddenly sought to shrink, to render themselves\r\ninconspicuous, to take the first step towards total invisibility.\r\n\r\nAn effect of the same development--of the increasing size of the unit\r\ngun, and therefore of the decreasing number of units which a ship could\r\ncarry--was the mounting of every big gun so as to command as large an\r\narc of fire as possible.\r\n\r\nAs the final development we note that the steam engine, in endowing the\r\nwarship with motions far more variable, certain and controlled than\r\nthose of the sailing ship, called forth tactical ideas quite different,\r\nin many respects, from those which governed sea actions in the canvas\r\nperiod. The warship itself is the embodiment of tactical ideas. Hence\r\nthe design of the steam-propelled warship evolved along a different\r\nline from that of the sailing ship.\r\n\r\nBy the effect and interaction of these developments a complete\r\nrevolution was compassed in naval architecture; by the progress of\r\nartillery and the steam engine, and by the improvement in mechanical\r\nprocesses in general, an entirely new unit of naval force was evolved\r\nfrom the old sailing ship: the mastless, turreted ironclad of the late\r\n’sixties, the precursor of the modern battleship.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the shell gun given proofs of its destructive powers than\r\nexperiments on the penetrative power of projectiles began to assume\r\nimportance, and as early as 1838 trials were being made at Portsmouth\r\nagainst a hulk, the result of which, confirming the experiments made\r\nby the French with the _Pacificateur_ some sixteen years previously,\r\ndemonstrated the far-reaching effects of explosive shell against a\r\nship’s side-timbers. Four years later the prime minister was apprised\r\nfrom New York that the Americans had discovered a suitable and adequate\r\nprotection for ships’ sides; iron plates of three-eighths of an inch\r\nin thickness, riveted together to form a compound 6-inch plate, were\r\nalleged to have been found ball-proof. On receipt of which intelligence\r\nthe Admiralty instructed Sir Thomas Hastings, captain of the\r\n_Excellent_, to confirm or disprove by actual trial. Trial was made,\r\nbut it was reported that no protection was afforded by such plates\r\nagainst the fire of 8-inch shell or 32-pounder shot, even at 200 yards’\r\nrange. No defensive remedy could be devised against shell fire, and the\r\nonly counter-measures deemed practical were of an offensive nature,\r\nviz. to mount shell guns as powerful as those of the enemy, and to keep\r\nhim at a distance by the employment of large and far-ranging solid-shot\r\nordnance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime iron, which was not acceptable as a protection, had\r\nbeen accepted as a constructive material for ships. For some years it\r\nhad been increasingly used for mercantile shipping with satisfactory\r\nresults. The scarcity of timber and its cost, as well as the positive\r\nadvantages to be obtained from the use of the much stronger and more\r\nplentiful material, had decided the Admiralty in ’43 to build iron\r\nwarships. Some small vessels were built and, in spite of adverse\r\ncriticism and alarming prediction, acquitted themselves admirably on\r\nservice. In ’46 it was resolved, however, to put iron to the test\r\nof artillery. An iron steamboat, the _Ruby_, was used as a target\r\nby the _Excellent_ gunners, and the results were unfavourable; the\r\nstopping power of the thin metal was small, and the balls which went\r\nclean through the near side wrought extensive damage on the opposite\r\nplates. In ’49 trials were made with stouter plates with more promising\r\nresults: a report favourable to iron as a protection for topsides was\r\nmade. But in ’51, as the result of elaborate trials made against a\r\n“mock up” of the side of the _Simoon_, the previous conclusions were\r\nreversed. Iron was condemned altogether as unsuitable for ships of war.\r\n“The shot and shell,” reported Captain Chads, “on striking are shivered\r\ninto innumerable pieces, passing on as a cloud of langrage with great\r\nvelocity,” and working great destruction among the crew. Nor was a\r\ncombination of wood and iron any better. In fact the report claimed\r\nthat, as regards the suitability or the unsuitability of iron, these\r\nexperiments might be deemed to set the question at rest. The experience\r\nof the French had apparently been somewhat similar to our own. In both\r\ncountries the use of iron for warships received a sudden check and,\r\nin England at any rate, the idea of unarmoured wood was once again\r\naccepted. In both countries the opinion was widely held that iron was\r\nunsuitable either for construction or protection, and that the view of\r\nGeneral Paixhans, that vessels might be made proof even against shells\r\nby being “cuirassées en fer,” was preposterous and impracticable.[161]\r\n\r\nPotentially, as it now seems, wooden sailing ships were so weak in\r\ndefensive qualities that the new artillery, if only it could be\r\nadequately protected, had them at its mercy. Actually it required the\r\nrude test of war to establish the unpalatable truth. In November,\r\n1853, such proof was given. At Sinope a squadron of Turkish frigates\r\narmed with solid-shot guns was almost blown out of the water by shell\r\nfire from a powerful Russian squadron; the latter were practically\r\nuninjured, while the Turkish fleet was set on fire and a terrible\r\nmortality inflicted among the crews in a short time. General Paixhans,\r\nwho had lived to see his invention fulfil in actual warfare his early\r\npredictions, was able to emphasize, in the columns of the official\r\n_Moniteur_, the arguments against large ships and the advantages which\r\nwould accrue to France especially by the subdivision of force and the\r\nsubstitution of small protected steamers armed with heavy guns for the\r\nexisting wooden ships-of-the-line. The concentrated fire of a few such\r\nsteamers would overpower the radiating fire of the largest three-decker.\r\n\r\nThe type of naval warfare imposed on the allies in the Crimean War lent\r\nspecial force to Paixhans’ arguments. For the attack of fortresses\r\nand coasts whose waters were exceptionally shallow it was at any rate\r\nclear that the orthodox form of warship, unarmoured, of large size\r\nand of deep draught, was of very limited value. Some special form was\r\nnecessary; France made a rapid decision. Napoleon III issued an order\r\nfor the construction of a flotilla of floating batteries, light-draught\r\nvessels capable of carrying heavy shell guns and of being covered with\r\niron armour strong enough to resist not only solid shot but the effects\r\nof explosive shell.\r\n\r\nThe idea of armouring ships was, of course, not novel. Armour of sorts\r\nhad been utilized from antiquity; in the days when the shields of the\r\nmen-at-arms were ranged along the bulwarks of the war galleys; in\r\nthe Tudor days when the waists of ships were protected by high elm\r\n“blinders,” and when Andrea Doria’s carrack was so sheathed with lead\r\nand bolted with brass that “it was impossible to sink her though all\r\nthe artillery of a fleet were fired against her.” In the eighteenth\r\ncentury the French themselves had attempted to clothe floating\r\nbatteries with armour, not indeed against shells but against red-hot\r\nshot. In 1782 they had devised, for the attack on Gibraltar, six wooden\r\nfloating batteries which, with their armament, were protected by a\r\nbelt of sand enclosed in cork and kept moist with sea water. But this\r\nexperience had been disastrous. The sand-drenching apparatus failed to\r\nact, and the batteries were almost totally destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nBut now, although experiments with iron-plated ships had been the\r\nreverse of satisfactory, data were to hand which showed that, if used\r\nin sufficient thickness, iron plates _were_ capable of withstanding\r\nthe disruptive effects of shell. At Vincennes trials had been made,\r\nbetween 1851 and 1854, with various thicknesses and dispositions of\r\niron; with plates four to five and a half inches thick, with compound\r\nplates, and with plates supported on a hard wood lining eighteen\r\ninches thick; of all of which the thick simple plates had proved the\r\nmost effective. So the five floating batteries ordered for work in the\r\nCrimea were covered with 4-inch iron plates backed by a thick lining.\r\nSixty-four feet long, 42 feet in beam, drawing about 18 feet of water,\r\narmed with sixteen 56-pounder shell guns and equipped with auxiliary\r\nsteam machinery for manœuvring, their construction was hastened with\r\nall possible speed. By October, ’55, three of them, the _Dévastation_,\r\n_Tonnante_, and _Lave_, had joined the allied flags, and on the 17th of\r\nthat month they took a principal part in the bombardment of Kinburn.\r\nTheir success was complete. Although repeatedly hit their iron plates\r\nwere only dented by the Russian shot and shell. “Everything,” reported\r\nthe French commander-in-chief, “may be expected from these formidable\r\nengines of war.” Once again the arguments of Paixhans for armoured war\r\nvessels had been justified; the experience gained with iron armour at\r\nKinburn confirmed that gained with shell guns at Sinope. France at once\r\nproceeded to apply these lessons to the improvement of her navy proper.\r\n\r\nIn England, on the other hand, no great impression was created either\r\nby shells or by iron protection. A comfortable faith in our fleets of\r\ntimber-built ships persisted; and, with regard to policy, as it had\r\nbeen with shell guns, and with steam propulsion, so it appeared to be\r\nwith armour; the national desire was to avoid for as long a time as\r\npossible all change which would have the effect of depreciating the\r\nvalue of our well-tried material. At the same time it is remarkable\r\nhow small an effect was conveyed to expert opinion, both here and in\r\nAmerica, by the events of the Crimean War. In the years immediately\r\nfollowing the war some notable technical works were published:\r\nDahlgren’s _Shell and Shell Guns_, Read’s _Modifications to Ships of\r\nthe Royal Navy_, Grantham’s _Iron Shipbuilding_, Sir Howard Douglas’\r\n_Naval Warfare with Steam_, and Hans Busk’s _Navies of the World_. From\r\nthese works and from the press and parliamentary discussions of the day\r\nit is evident that, outside France, the impressions created were vague\r\nand conflicting. The main lesson conveyed was the great tactical value\r\nof steam propulsion. The reports laid no emphasis on shells, and so\r\nscanty was the information concerning them that it was very difficult\r\nto appraise their value. Their effect at Sinope was disguised by the\r\noverwhelming superiority of the Russian force, which rendered the\r\nresult of the action a foregone conclusion; on another occasion (at\r\nSebastopol) shells fired at long range were reported to have failed to\r\npenetrate or embed themselves in a ship’s timbers. Commander Dahlgren\r\nwas uncertain, in the absence of fuller information, whether shells had\r\njustified their advocates or not. Nor was Grantham impressed by the\r\nFrench floating batteries. “One only of these vessels,” he incorrectly\r\nsays, “was thus engaged, but then not under circumstances that gave any\r\ngood proof of their efficiency, as the fire was distant and not very\r\nheavy.”\r\n\r\nSo no violent change in our naval material followed as the immediate\r\nresult of the war. Only in the matter of light-draught gunboats and\r\nbatteries tardy action was forced on the authorities by public opinion.\r\nAlthough iron had been condemned for warship construction iron ships\r\nhad been built in the years preceding the war in considerable numbers\r\nfor foreign governments; the firms of Laird and Scott Russell had\r\nbuilt in 1850 powerful light-draught gunboats for Russia, and in the\r\nsame year Russia had ordered from a Thames firm an iron gunboat whose\r\nnovel design had been brought to the notice of the Admiralty. But these\r\ncraft were intended for the defence of shallow waters, and nothing\r\nanalogous to them was considered necessary for the British navy. The\r\nexigencies of the war demonstrated in the course of time the value of\r\nthese light-draught vessels. Still there was long hesitation; though\r\nthe French government pressed on us their advantages, and presented\r\nour minister with the plans of their own floating batteries. The\r\ndisappointment of the Baltic expedition, however, and the realization\r\nthat the powerful British fleet which in the summer of ’54 had set\r\nout to reduce Cronstadt had done nothing but prove the inherent\r\nunsuitability of large ships-of-the-line for the attack of fortresses\r\nin shallow waters, gave rise to a loud demand in the press that\r\ngunboats should be built. Several were accordingly laid down. The first\r\nof these were found to be too deep, but others of lighter draught\r\nwere designed and by the autumn of ’55 sixteen were ready; and these,\r\ntogether with some dockyard lighters which had been fitted as mortar\r\nvessels, joined a flotilla of French floating batteries in the Baltic\r\nand effectually bombarded Sveaborg. As the war progressed the value of\r\nironclad gunboats became more fully appreciated. A large number was\r\nordered, but most of them were only completed in time to fire a grand\r\nsalute in honour of the proclamation of peace.[162]\r\n\r\nApart from the building of these gunboats innovation was avoided.\r\nUnarmoured wooden ships, equipped with a mixed armament of shot and\r\nshell guns, continued to be launched and passed into commission,\r\nand it was only after France had constructed, at Toulon in ’58, an\r\niron-encased frigate, that England unwillingly followed suit, convinced\r\nat last that a reconstruction of her materials could no longer be\r\naverted.\r\n\r\n_La Gloire_, the iron-belted frigate, was the direct result of the\r\nlessons gained from the floating batteries in the Russian war. After\r\nKinburn the French naval authorities took up the study of how to apply\r\narmour to sea-going ships. Was it possible to embody in a fighting unit\r\nsea-going capacity, high speed, great offensive power, in addition to\r\nthe defensive qualities possessed by the slow, unwieldy batteries?\r\nCould such a weight as iron armour would entail be embodied in a ship\r\ndesign without loss of other important qualities? It was concluded\r\nthat, while it would be impossible to cover the sides completely, it\r\nwould be possible to protect the surfaces near the water-line, under\r\ncover of which all the ships’ vital parts could be secreted. A great\r\nincrease in defensive power would thus be obtained. Before developing a\r\nplan in detail it was decided to carry out further armour trials, and\r\nsolid iron plates of 4½ inches thickness were fired at with English\r\n68-pounders and French 50-pounders, with solid balls and with charged\r\nshells. The results were satisfactory, so these plates were adopted as\r\nthe standard of armour protection. To the design of M. Dupuy de Lôme\r\nthe first ironclad frigate was constructed from a fine two-decked ship,\r\nthe _Napoleon_, which was cut down, lengthened, and armoured from stem\r\nto stern. The result was the celebrated _Gloire_. She was followed\r\nshortly afterwards by two sister vessels. And then, in order to obtain\r\na direct comparison between timber-built and iron ships, an armoured\r\n_iron_ frigate, the _Couronne_, was also built. The three wooden ships\r\nwere given a complete belt round the water-line of 4½ inches of iron;\r\nthe _Couronne_ had compound armour--3-inch and 1½-inch iron plates\r\nseparated from each other and from the iron stem-plating by wood lining\r\n6 inches in thickness. The armament of all four frigates consisted of\r\nthirty-six 50-pounder shell guns, carried low. They were given yacht\r\nmasts and equipped with propelling machinery designed to give them 12\r\nknots speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe naval position of England at this time was the reverse of\r\nsatisfactory. Comparing the material resources of the two great\r\nmaritime rivals, it came to be noted with surprise that France, taking\r\nadvantage of the development of steam propulsion during the decade,\r\nhad actually drawn level with England in the numbers of steam warships\r\navailable and in their aggregate motive horse-power. The French had\r\nsubmitted to great financial outlay on account of their navy. In this\r\ncountry a reaction, following the large and partially ineffective\r\nexpenditure incurred in the Crimean War, had dried up the sources of\r\nsupplies and stunted constructional development; there was little to\r\nshow for the money spent on such works as the enlargement of docks\r\nand on the extensive new factories and docks established at Sheerness\r\nand Keyham. Apprehension was widespread when the intelligence of the\r\nbuilding of the iron-sided ships was received, and this apprehension\r\ndeveloped when whispers reached Westminster of a huge prospective\r\nprogramme meditated by France. To allay the panic a parliamentary\r\ncommittee was formed to inquire into the relative strength of the two\r\nnavies; and their report, published in January, 1859, made bad reading.\r\nComparing the steam navies--for, the committee reported, sailing ships\r\ncould not be opposed to steamships with any chance of success--France\r\nand England each had afloat the same number of line-of-battle ships,\r\nviz. twenty-nine; and as regards frigates France had thirty-four to\r\nEngland’s twenty-six! This did not include the four _frégates blindées_\r\nlaid down by France, which would be substitutes for line-of-battle\r\nships, which were being built with the scantling of three-deckers,\r\nand which were to be armed with thirty-six heavy guns, most of them\r\n50-pounders throwing an 80-pound hollow percussion shell. “So convinced\r\ndo naval men seem to be in France,” note the committee, “of the\r\nirresistible qualities of these ships, that they are of opinion that\r\nno more ships-of-the-line will be laid down, and that in ten years\r\nthat class of vessel will have become obsolete.” The position is bad\r\nenough; yet so bewildered are our experts by the radical developments\r\nof the rival navy, so difficult appears the problem of countering the\r\nFrench designs by any new and well-studied procedure, that all that the\r\ncommittee can recommend is the accelerated conversion of our remaining\r\nsailing ships to steam. The committee realize that naval architecture,\r\nand still more naval artillery, is in a state of transition, and that\r\nthe late invention of Armstrong’s gun “may possibly affect even the\r\nsize and structure of ships of war.”\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, however, for a country desirous of maintaining its\r\nmaritime supremacy to wait upon perfection in the manner implied as\r\nthe policy of the parliamentary committee. Some drastic and immediate\r\naction was necessary, to redress the advantage accruing to France from\r\nthe possession of the _Gloire_ and her sister frigates. Such action was\r\nduly taken; but before proceeding to examine this action it will be\r\nnecessary to revert for a moment to a consideration of iron. We have\r\nalready sketched the evolution of iron as a protective covering for\r\nwarships; we must now glance back and briefly trace its progress as a\r\nconstructive material.\r\n\r\nIron vessels had appeared on the canals of England in the latter part\r\nof the eighteenth century. In 1815 a pleasure boat of that material\r\nhad sailed on the River Mersey, attracting crowds of people whose\r\ncredulity had been severely strained by the statement that an iron ship\r\nwould float. Admiral Napier had manifested an early interest in iron\r\nships; in 1820, in partnership with a Mr. Manby, he had constructed\r\nthe first iron steamer, the _Aaron Manby_, and navigated it from\r\nLondon up the Seine to Paris, where in ’22 it attracted considerable\r\nattention. From this date onwards iron vessels increased in number.\r\nIn ’39 the _Nemesis_ and _Phlegethon_ were built by Mr. Laird for the\r\nEast India Company, and in the China war of ’42 these gunboats played\r\na conspicuous and significant part. The grounding of the _Nemesis_ in\r\n’40 on the rocks of Scilly afforded early evidence of the value of\r\nwatertight bulkheads (a Chinese invention) when embodied in an iron\r\nhull.\r\n\r\nAs the size of ships increased, the disabilities attaching to the use\r\nof timber became more and more evident. Though braced internally by\r\nan elaborate system of iron straps, knees, and nutted bolts in iron\r\nor copper, the large timber-built ship, considered as a structure,\r\nwas fundamentally weak; in fact the presence of the straps and ties\r\ncontributed in no small degree to its inability to withstand continuous\r\nstress. The fastenings did not accord with the materials which they\r\nfastened together, and the wood was relatively so soft that when a\r\nsevere strain arose a general yielding took place, the boltheads\r\nsinking into the wood and causing it to give way to the pressure thrown\r\nlocally upon it. As tonnage increased the metal fastenings grew more\r\nand more conspicuous, the ship became a composite structure of wood\r\nand iron, with the result that uniformity of elasticity and strength\r\nwas lost and the stresses, instead of being distributed throughout\r\nthe structure, tended to become localized at certain points. “The\r\nmetallic fastenings of a timber-built ship act to accelerate her\r\ndestruction so soon as the close connection of the several parts is at\r\nall diminished.” So in 1840 wrote Augustin Creuze, a graduate of the\r\ndisbanded school of naval architecture and one of the most gifted and\r\neminent men of his profession at that day.\r\n\r\nIron ships, on the other hand, were found to be well adapted to\r\nwithstand the racking stresses, the localized loads and the vibrations\r\nwhich were introduced by steam machinery; they were lighter than\r\nwooden ships, more capacious, more easily shaped to give the fine\r\nlines necessary for speed, cheaper and immeasurably stronger. In\r\ncourse of time the objections to them gradually vanished; by aid of\r\nthe scientists the derangement of their compasses was overcome, the\r\ndangers from lightning were obviated, and the extent of the fouling to\r\nwhich their surfaces were liable was kept within limits. In course of\r\ntime, in spite of natural preference and vested interest, and since\r\nthe advantages of iron were confirmed by continuous experience, wood\r\nbecame almost entirely superseded by the metal for large mercantile\r\nconstruction. But in the case of warships, as we have seen, insuperable\r\nobjections seemed to prohibit the change of material. No sooner had a\r\nstep been taken by the Admiralty, in the ordering of a group of iron\r\npaddlewheel frigates in ’43, than an outcry arose; the wooden walls\r\nof England were in danger, the opponents of iron declared, and iron\r\nships were wholly unsuitable for warlike purposes. More were ordered in\r\n’46. Sir Charles Napier, whose opinion naturally carried great weight\r\nwith the public, led the opposition, and when, in ’49, the artillery\r\ntrial demonstrated the dangerous effects of shot and shell on thin iron\r\nplates, the advocates of iron were fain to admit the error of their\r\nopinions. The iron frigates were struck from the establishment and\r\ntransformed--such of them as were completed--into unarmed transports.\r\n\r\nAs experience with iron ships accumulated, the feeling grew in\r\ncertain quarters that the artillery trials, the results of which had\r\nbeen claimed as being decisive proof of the unsuitability of iron\r\nfor warships, might not have been the last word upon the subject.\r\nThe events of the Crimean War tended to emphasize the doubt and\r\nuncertainty. A few there were who saw in that war clear proofs of the\r\nsuperiority of iron over wood; who argued that, though iron had proved\r\nto be dangerous in the form of thin plates in certain circumstances,\r\nyet it had shown itself to be impervious both to shot and shell, and\r\nindeed an indispensable defence in certain circumstances when applied\r\nin sufficient thickness; that thicker plates than those condemned as\r\ndangerous might therefore prove to be a great protection against shell\r\nfire; and that, even as regards thin plates, the splintering effect of\r\nshell against these was small, from all accounts, compared with the\r\n_incendiary_ effect of shell against timber. And in what other respects\r\nwere the advantages of iron contested?\r\n\r\nBut, acting upon expert advice and influence, doubtless, by the\r\nremembrance of the _Birkenhead_ and _Simoon_ fiasco, the government\r\nstill felt unable to sanction the use of iron, and it was not until\r\nnews of the laying down of the _Gloire_ reached England that a decision\r\nwas made to adopt the new material, both as armour and for the hulls of\r\nwarships.\r\n\r\nThe high protagonist of timber-built ships, it was shortly afterwards\r\nrevealed, was Sir Howard Douglas: the most strenuous advocate of iron\r\nwas John Scott Russell. For years, it appeared, Sir Howard had been\r\nthe influential and successful adviser of the government against the\r\nadoption of iron. “I was consulted by Sir Robert Peel,” he wrote\r\nin 1860, “on his accession to the government, as to the use and\r\nefficiency of a certain half-dozen iron frigates, two of which were\r\nfinished, and four constructing by contract. I stated in reply that\r\nvessels wholly constructed of iron were utterly unfit for all the\r\npurposes of war, whether armed or as transports for the conveyance of\r\ntroops.” In the same paper he stated the arguments on which he had\r\ntendered this advice; and these arguments appeared so fallacious,\r\nand the facts on which they were based so disputable, as to seem to\r\ncall for some reply from the builders of iron ships. Sir Howard had\r\ncertainly strayed far from science in his unsupported statements\r\nas to the calamitous effects of iron if used for warships; and\r\nunfortunately he had allowed himself to stigmatize the _Great Eastern_,\r\nas representative of iron ships generally, as “an awful roller,” and\r\nas never having attained anything like her calculated speed. Scott\r\nRussell made a violent reply. “After establishing that Sir H. Douglas’s\r\nconclusions are the reverse of the truth,” he began, “I shall proceed\r\nto establish that the future navy of England must be an iron navy. That\r\nits construction must be founded on facts and principles, which Sir H.\r\nDouglas’s writings ignore, and his deductions contradict; and I believe\r\nI shall prove that if iron ships had been introduced at the time\r\nwhen Sir Howard says he sedulously and systematically opposed their\r\nintroduction, the money which has been spent on a wooden fleet about to\r\nbecome valueless would have given England a fleet greatly more powerful\r\nthan the combined navies of the world.”[163]\r\n\r\nIt may be conceded that in this public argument Scott Russell had the\r\nadvantage: the architect of the _Great Eastern_ had little difficulty\r\nin confuting the views of the artillerist. But by this time the\r\nbattle between wood and iron had been fought and won. The Board of\r\nAdmiralty, influenced by the arguments of Scott Russell and their own\r\nconstructors, and in the presence of gigantic achievements in the form\r\nof iron-built liners, felt unable to agree with Sir Howard in his\r\ncontinued advocacy of timber; Sir John Pakington expressed his personal\r\ndoubts to him in a correspondence. Expert opinion, naval officers and\r\narchitects, leaned more and more in the direction of the new material,\r\nand, early in 1859, the decision was made to build an armoured frigate\r\n_of iron_. It was a momentous decision. The “wooden walls” had crumbled\r\nat last, and iron had won acceptance as alone able to cope with the\r\nnew forces brought into existence by the progress of artillery and\r\nsteam machinery. The opponents of iron could not sustain for long their\r\narguments in favour of timber; experience was accumulating against\r\nthem, and it was necessary to accept defeat. Chief among them was Sir\r\nHoward Douglas. There is, surely, something pathetic in the episode of\r\nhis long-continued struggle against radical change; something tragic in\r\nthe spectacle of this scientist, whose labours had done more, perhaps,\r\nthan any other man’s for the efficiency of the nineteenth-century navy,\r\nin his old age casting the great weight of his influence unwittingly\r\nagainst the navy’s interest? How gamely the old general fought for\r\nhis convictions is told us by his biographer, who with a natural\r\nwarmth denounced the fierce criticism which Scott Russell had directed\r\nagainst a veteran of eighty-five winters, devoting his last hours to\r\nthe service of his country. “His resistance to armour ships bore him\r\ndown, his arguments met with unbelief, or elicited taunts, and ceased\r\nto influence the public. ‘All that I have said about armour ships will\r\nprove correct,’ he remarked, twenty-four hours before his death, toward\r\nthe end of ’61. ‘How little do they know of the undeveloped power of\r\nartillery!’”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIn June, 1859, some months before the launching of the _Gloire_, the\r\nreply was given: the _Warrior_ was laid down. Up to this time the\r\ninitiative, in the slow evolution of naval material, had rested mainly\r\nwith France. From this moment England, having taken up the challenge,\r\nassumed the initiative and its responsibilities; and from now onwards,\r\nin spite of false moves, failures, and ineffective expenditures of\r\nmoney and labour, she regained more and more surely the preponderance\r\nin naval strength which she had possessed of old. At last a scientific\r\nera of naval architecture had opened. Up to this time the design and\r\nconstruction of warships had been treated as a mere craft: a craft\r\nhampered, moreover, by absence of method, reluctance to adopt new\r\nviews, limitations as to size, interference and ever-varying decisions\r\nas to such factors as the extent of sail-power or the number of guns\r\nto be carried. By the official acceptance of scientific methods this\r\nwas largely changed. By the raising of the old office of Surveyor to\r\nthe dignity of Controller of the Navy, by the institution of a new\r\nschool of naval architecture to take the place of that suppressed\r\nin 1832 (whose most eminent graduates, fittingly enough, were the\r\nchief witnesses against the debased state and management of naval\r\nconstruction as it was prior to 1860), by utilizing the services of\r\nmen trained in mathematics, the effect on naval architecture soon\r\nbecame apparent. Originality had scope, forethought and cleverness had\r\nfull play; men of considerable technical knowledge were pressed into\r\nservice, who proved well able to cope with the new developments.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this new orientation was the _Warrior_. It is usual to\r\nthink of her as similar to the _Gloire_; like her she was designed to\r\nresist the 68-pounder unit of artillery, like her she carried a belt of\r\niron armour 4½ inches thick, and was equipped with steam machinery to\r\ngive her a high speed. Yet in important respects she differed from her\r\nFrench rival.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _WARRIOR_\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph in the possession of Dr. Oscar Parkes, O.B.E.]\r\n\r\nFirstly, her size in relation to her armament caused general surprise.\r\nAdmittedly the policy of restricting dimensions, pursued with such\r\nrigour from the seventeenth to the beginning of the nineteenth century,\r\nhad operated to the detriment of our naval construction; admittedly\r\nthe long and fine-shaped sailing vessels built during recent years\r\nwere greatly superior to those of the older models; yet no reason\r\npresented itself for building a ship, of armament equal to that of the\r\n5000-ton French frigate, which would displace over 9000 tons. Were not\r\ncost and tonnage directly related, and was there some real necessity\r\nforcing us to build ships of so large a size? Was it true that the\r\nbasins at Portsmouth would require to be enlarged to take such a ship,\r\nand that her draught would be such that she could only be docked\r\nat certain tides? The question was debated vigorously by the Board\r\nitself. Three considerations, according to an authoritative statement\r\nmade to parliament, prompted the decision to depart widely from the\r\ndesign adopted by the French: considerations one or more of which have\r\ninfluenced all subsequent construction in this country. Firstly, the\r\nworld-wide duties of the British navy demanded a type of ship capable\r\nof making long and distant voyages either with steam or sail: in\r\nshort, a fully rigged ship, a good sailer, and at the same time one\r\nwith sufficient carrying capacity to enable her to keep the seas for\r\na long time. Secondly, to ensure good sailing qualities and to avoid\r\na defect which had been experienced in our own ships fitted with\r\nheavy pivot guns, and which was predicted in the case of the _Gloire_,\r\nthe extremities must be as lightly loaded as possible, and not weighed\r\ndown with heavy armour. Thirdly--and this was more or less special to\r\nthe period--since artillery was already in a state of rapid transition\r\nto higher power, any protective armour approved must sooner or later\r\nbe insufficient and require to be augmented. These conditions, and the\r\nadvantages which increase of length were known to give in reducing\r\nthe propeller power necessary to obtain a certain speed, governed the\r\nspecifications to which the _Warrior_ was built. She was given a length\r\nof 380 feet, machinery for a speed of nearly 14 knots, full canvas,\r\ntelescopic funnels, and waterline armour over her central parts: the\r\nends being left unarmoured, but subdivided by watertight compartments.\r\nOf her forty-eight smooth-bore guns, twenty-six were behind armour and\r\ntwelve were outside of the protective belt; the remaining ten were\r\nmounted on the upper deck, also without protection.\r\n\r\nIn another respect the _Warrior_ bore witness to the foresight of\r\nthe Board. Hidden behind, and altogether disguised by, the shapely\r\nbow with its surmounting figure-head, was a stout iron ram-stem,\r\nworked to the knee and side-plates of the bow: an inconspicuous but\r\nsignificant feature. Ever since steamers had been established in the\r\nnavy the possibilities of ramming had been discussed. The revolution\r\nin tactics resulting from the introduction of steam as motive power\r\nhad been examined by authorities such as Bowles and Moorson, Douglas,\r\nDahlgren and Labrousse, and all of them saw in the new conditions an\r\nopening for the use of the ram. In ’44 Captain Labrousse had suggested\r\nstrengthening the bows of wooden ships for this purpose, and in England\r\nAdmiral Sartorius had become the advocate of a special type of warship\r\nbuilt expressly to ram. The circumstances of the naval warfare of the\r\nCrimea, in which slow-moving steamers operated in restricted waters,\r\nhad displayed to naval men the advantages to be obtained from actual\r\ncollision--from the use of their ship itself as a projectile against\r\nthe enemy’s hull. In the case of the _Warrior_ an additional argument\r\nwas now to hand for providing a ram. The use of iron as armour had\r\nrestored the equilibrium between defence and attack which had been\r\ndisturbed by the adoption of shell fire; nay more, it had actually\r\nturned the scale against artillery, the 68-pounder being unable to\r\npenetrate the armour of the ship in which it was carried. For this\r\nreason, that for the moment armour had the ascendancy over the gun, a\r\nram was considered to be necessary as an additional means of offence;\r\nand a ram was accordingly embodied in the _Warrior_, to the strength of\r\nwhich her converging iron-plate structure aptly contributed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, leaving the _Warrior_ for a moment, it will be convenient to\r\nglance ahead and note the part played by the ram and the value set upon\r\nit in connection with later types of warships.\r\n\r\nIn 1860 no doubt was felt but that ramming would play a very important\r\npart in future warfare. The experiences of the American Civil War\r\nof ’62 seemed to supply a perfect confirmation of this opinion. “We\r\nfought the _Merrimac_ for more than three hours this forenoon,” wrote\r\nthe engineer of the _Monitor_ to John Ericsson, “and sent her back\r\nto Norfolk in a sinking condition. Ironclad against ironclad, we\r\nmanœuvred about the bay here (Hampton Roads), and went at each other\r\nwith mutual fierceness.... We were struck twenty-two times, the pilot\r\nhouse twice, the turret nine times, the side armour eight times, deck\r\nthree times.... She tried to run us down and sink us, as she did the\r\n_Cumberland_ yesterday, but she got the worst of it. Her bow passed\r\nover our deck, and our sharp upper-edged side cut through the light\r\niron shoe upon her stem, and well into her oak. She will not try that\r\nagain. She gave us a tremendous thump but did not injure us in the\r\nleast.... The turret is a splendid structure....”\r\n\r\nOn the preceding day the iron-covered _Merrimac_ had sunk the wooden\r\nsailing ship _Cumberland_ by ram alone, without the aid of artillery,\r\nthe shots from her victim’s guns glancing off her iron casing “like\r\nhailstones off a tin roof.” She had then opened on the wooden\r\n_Congress_ with shell fire, and in a short time the crowded decks of\r\nthat ship had been reduced to a shambles. Then she had fought the\r\ninconclusive duel with the armoured _Monitor_. What lessons were at\r\nlength driven home by these three single actions! What a novel warfare\r\ndid they not foretell! The helplessness of the wooden ship when\r\nattacked by an ironclad was apparent, the terrific effects of shell\r\nfire were once again conclusively proved. The value of thick armour was\r\nonce more shown, but, above all, the power of the ram, the new _arme\r\nblanche_ of sea warfare, seemed to be indisputably demonstrated. On\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic a revision of values took place: the wooden\r\nnavies of the world sank into insignificance, the _Warrior_ and her\r\ntype were seen to be the main support and measure of each nation’s\r\nnaval power. “The man who goes into action in a wooden ship is a fool,”\r\nSir John Hay was quoted as saying, “and the man who sends him there\r\nis a villain.” The ocean-sceptre of Britain was broken, thought an\r\nAmerican writer forgetful of the limitations of monitors, by the blow\r\nwhich crushed the sides of the _Cumberland_ and _Congress_.\r\n\r\nFour years later the battle of Lissa, in which the ironclad squadrons\r\nof Austria and Italy were engaged with one another, gave confirmation\r\nthat the lessons of Hampton Roads were also applicable to blue-water\r\nactions. “Full speed. Ironclads rush against the enemy and sink him,”\r\nwas the signal made by the Austrian admiral, Tegetthof. The ram was\r\nhis chief weapon of offence, the gun being a useful auxiliary in\r\ngaining him the victory; gunfire, by disabling the steering gear of the\r\n_Ré d’Italia_, making her an easy prey for the ram of his flagship,\r\n_Ferdinand Max_.\r\n\r\nOf all the factors influencing the evolution of naval material, the\r\nexperiences and records of actual warfare are naturally considered\r\nto carry the greatest weight in council: they are, indeed, the only\r\ndata whose acceptance is indisputable. The claims and achievements\r\nput forward in time of peace, however their excellence may have been\r\nattested by the most realistic experiments, are all referred to\r\nactual war for trial, and are accepted only in so far as they fit\r\nin with war experience. But sea actions between ironclads have been\r\nfew and far between. It has been the more difficult, therefore, to\r\ndraw from them the true lessons conveyed; the fixed points have been\r\ninsufficient in number, so to speak, to allow of the true curve of\r\nprogress being traced. Not only has this insufficiency been evident,\r\nbut the restriction in the area of war experience has had another\r\nharmful effect, in that undue weight has been given to each individual\r\nexperience. Difficult as it always is to strip each experience of its\r\nspecial circumstances and deduce from it the correct conclusion, errors\r\nhave undoubtedly been made; and these errors have had a prominence\r\nwhich would not have been theirs if the number of experiences had been\r\ngreater. On the other hand, an altogether insufficient weight has\r\ncommonly been given to the experiences of peace-time.\r\n\r\nThese remarks find one application in the ram, and in the value placed\r\nupon it in the ’sixties and ’seventies. During this period artillery\r\nwas undergoing a continuous and rapid improvement, eventually turning\r\nthe scales against defensive armour; steam power was expanding and\r\nthe manœuvring capacities of ships were being extended, so as to make\r\nramming an operation more and more difficult to perform. Yet faith in\r\nthe ram grew rather than decreased, influenced almost entirely by the\r\nevidence of the two sea-actions.\r\n\r\nWhat was the actual experience of ramming gained in peace-time? In ’68\r\nAdmiral Warden, commanding the Channel Fleet, reported: “So long as\r\na ship has good way on her, and a good command of steam to increase\r\nher speed at pleasure, that ship cannot be what is called ‘rammed’;\r\nshe cannot even be struck to any purpose so long as she has room,\r\nand is properly handled. The use of ships as rams, it appears to me,\r\nwill only be called into play after an action has commenced, when\r\nships, of necessity, are reduced to a low rate of speed--probably\r\ntheir lowest.” As time progressed the chances of ramming certainly\r\ngrew less. Yet Lissa and Hampton Roads continued to influence opinion\r\nto such a degree, as to lead to a glorification of ram tactics; in\r\nthe press, and in the technical institutions which had now come into\r\nbeing, the ram retained a lustre which it no longer deserved. So long\r\nas artillery was feeble and gunnery of low efficiency, and so long as\r\nspeeds of ships were slow and manœuvring power restricted, the ram was\r\nof great potential value. As these conditions changed, the value of\r\nthe ram declined. But for a time it was actually in question which of\r\nthe two forms of power, the steam engine or the gun, would ultimately\r\nexert the greater influence as a weapon in action. The subject of a\r\nPrize Essay for 1872 was, “The Manœuvres and System of Tactics which\r\nFleets of Ships should adopt, to develop the powers of the Ram, Heavy\r\nArtillery, Torpedoes, etc., in an action in the open sea”; and it was\r\nthe opinion of the prize-winner, Commander G. H. Noel, that the ram\r\nwas at that time fast supplanting the gun in importance. “The serious\r\npart of a future naval attack,” wrote Captain Colomb, in _Lessons\r\nfrom Lissa_, “does not appear to be the guns, but the rams.” And the\r\nFrench Admiral Touchard described the ram as “the principal weapon in\r\nnaval combats--the _ultima ratio_ of maritime warfare.” “There is a\r\nnew warfare,” said Scott Russell in 1870. “It is no longer, Lay her\r\nalongside, but, Give her the stem, which will be the order of battle.”\r\nAnd he predicted fleets of high-speed vessels, equipped with powerful\r\nrams and twin-screw engines, in which both guns and armour were merely\r\nof secondary importance. And writers on tactics discerned future\r\nsquadrons in action charging each other after the manner of heavy\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of artillery falsified these expectations. With the\r\ngrowing advantage of artillery over the defence, and with the coming of\r\nthe torpedo, fighting ranges increased and the use of the ram declined.\r\nWith greater speeds and greater ranges the possibility of ramming\r\nbecame (as might be deduced mathematically) a diminishing ratio; before\r\nthe end of the century it was sufficiently clear, and was confirmed by\r\nactual warfare, that the ram formed but a very secondary factor of a\r\nwarship’s offensive power. But for some years ramming, and “bows-on”\r\nfighting in which ramming was intended to play an important part,\r\ninfluenced to a great extent the designs of warships.\r\n\r\nSo much for the ram, first fitted in the _Warrior_. In her sister\r\nship the ram was less pronounced and, before Hampton Roads had drawn\r\nattention to its possibilities, it was even in question to renounce\r\nit altogether. In the case of the _Warrior_ the heavy figure-head\r\nso overhung the ram that many were dubious whether the latter would\r\nseriously damage an enemy; and, moreover, the wisdom of driving a fully\r\nrigged ship against another vessel, and risking the dismantling of\r\nher masts and rigging, was widely doubted. In other respects, except\r\nfor her armour belt and for the material of which she was built, that\r\nvessel was not radically different from her predecessors; the first of\r\niron-built ironclads was a handsome screw frigate not unlike previous\r\nBritish ships of her type, from whom she was lineally descended.\r\n\r\nAlthough on the whole she was a conspicuous success, it was soon\r\napparent that the great length of the _Warrior_ tended to make her\r\ndifficult to manœuvre: in fact, made her deficient in that very\r\nquality--handiness--which was indispensable to her effective use as\r\na ram. And this unhandiness was accentuated in the _Minotaur_ class\r\nwhich was begun in 1861. These ships were given a belt an inch thicker\r\nthan that of the _Warrior_, and, partial protection being considered\r\nobjectionable, especially as leaving exposed the steering gear and a\r\nportion of the gun armament, the belt was made continuous over the\r\nwhole length of the ship. This length, owing to the extra weight of\r\nthe armour, was 400 feet: 20 feet greater than that of the _Warrior_\r\nand a hundred greater than that of the longest timber-built ships. At\r\nfirst, five masts were fitted, in order to obtain a large sail-area\r\nwhile at the same time keeping the size of each sail within desirable\r\nlimits; but these were afterwards reduced to three. Sail power and\r\nsteam machinery were seen to be an imperfect combination in so large\r\na vessel. The _Minotaur_ class proved to be costly, unhandy and\r\nvulnerable ships, and signalled a return to smaller dimensions. It was\r\nfound possible to design ships equally fast and equally well armed and\r\nprotected, by the use of fuller lines and less length and an increased\r\nengine power. “Increased manœuvring power and reduction in prime cost,”\r\nwrote the designer of the new type, “more than make amends for the\r\nmoderate addition to the steam power.”[164]\r\n\r\nHere we may briefly note the conversion of the timber-built fleet. In\r\n’57 Captain Moorsom had submitted a scheme of cutting down ships to\r\na short height above the water-line and using the weight thus gained\r\nto provide an armour belt. Sir Charles Napier had advocated a similar\r\npolicy in parliament. As soon as the necessity for armour was accepted\r\nthis policy was adopted; not only were the resources of the private\r\nship-yards bent to the building of a fleet of new iron warships, but\r\nthe best of the old navy was metamorphized in the royal dockyards by\r\nthe process of the _razee_: the cutting down of two-deckers and their\r\nconversion into iron-belted frigates. By these exertions France was\r\nsoon outstripped in the struggle. For a long time she clung to wooden\r\nships, though in ’62 she adopted iron for upper works; and of such\r\nships, of wooden bottoms but of iron above the water-line, she built a\r\nfleet “possessing only one possible merit--uniformity; which the new\r\nEnglish construction lacked.” The combination of heavy steam machinery\r\nand wooden hulls was the cause of continuous difficulties; the growth\r\nof artillery rendered the ships obsolete almost before they were built.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nBy the time the _Warrior_ and her sister ships were afloat the great\r\nstruggle between armour and artillery was well in progress. It was\r\na struggle which was to lead to unsuspected developments in naval\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, and in the presence of the new iron-built ironclads,\r\nthe gun was at its lowest point of effectiveness. But rifling had\r\nconferred new powers on it, and the greatest efforts were being put\r\nforth to improve its position. As it grew rapidly in size and power,\r\nnaval experts were faced with a succession of problems of extraordinary\r\ndifficulty. Two things were in question: both the type and the\r\ndisposition of gun best suited for a warship’s armament.\r\n\r\nWith regard to type, the adoption of armour inevitably gave a set-back\r\nto the value of the shell gun. Shells, which would rend and set on\r\nfire a wooden ship, would not pierce armour or inflame iron plates; of\r\nwhich facts Hampton Roads afforded a demonstration. It seemed clear\r\nalso from that incident, to experts in this country and in France,\r\nthat no extension of the Paixhans principle was likely to compete with\r\narmour in the future. The system of shell fire of General Paixhans,\r\nlike the shot system of the inventor of the carronade, had relied on\r\nlow muzzle velocities and curved trajectories, to effect its purpose.\r\nHis shells were for lodgment rather than penetration, and did not\r\ngain their effect by their kinetic energy; and in view of this their\r\ninventor had himself conceived the use of iron armour as the very means\r\nwhereby they might be countered. Nevertheless the Americans had been\r\nstrongly attracted by the Paixhans principle, and with their Dahlgrens\r\nand Columbiads had extended it in practice to embrace the use of guns\r\nof the largest calibres. The action between the _Monitor_ and the\r\n_Merrimac_ did nothing to shake their faith in this class of ordnance.\r\nSubsequent experiments appeared to confirm the national predilection;\r\nand one of their writers, in giving credit to the navy chiefs for\r\nadhering to the principle of the large smooth-bore gun, recorded that\r\nthe small-bore-and-high-velocity theory had received its quietus by\r\nthe utter demolition of a 6-inch plate by a ball from a 15-inch gun at\r\nWashington in February, 1864.[165] In France and England it was held,\r\nand held rightly, that high velocities were necessary for the attack of\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nIf shell guns were of small value, what was suitable? Were the old\r\nspherical solid shot still capable of beating the defence? A serious\r\neffort was made in this country to bring them to do it. The Armstrong\r\nrifled breech-loading guns recently adopted had been proving defective\r\nand indifferent on service; a return was wisely made to muzzle-loading;\r\nand it was in question also to revert to spherical shot and shell.\r\nSpherical shot of hardest steel were tried by the _Excellent_, in the\r\nhope that they would penetrate 4½-inch plates. Experimental guns were\r\nalso made, in 1864, to discharge 100-pound balls with charges of 25\r\npounds of powder; guns so heavy (6½ tons) that it was doubted at the\r\ntime whether they could be efficiently worked on the broadside of a\r\nrolling ship. Should not increased power be obtained by persevering\r\nwith rifled guns? The advantages possessed by the rifled gun in ranging\r\npower, accuracy, capacity of shell, were admitted; nevertheless the\r\nnavy as a whole favoured the smooth-bore, with its simplicity, rapidity\r\nof fire, strength, and greater initial velocity, and thought that, at\r\nclose ranges, the 100-pounder 6½-ton smooth-bore gun was the best and\r\nmost suitable weapon for the service. But the rifled gun was advancing\r\nrapidly. “By May, 1864, the 7-inch muzzle-loading rifled shunt gun of\r\n6½ tons had been tried in the _Excellent_, and had a good deal shaken\r\nthe position of the smooth-bore. Captain Key reported that it was more\r\nthan equal to naval requirements.... It was admirably adapted for the\r\nnaval service.”[166] This fired a projectile 115 pounds in weight. By\r\nJune of the following year the target of 9-inch plate representing the\r\nside of the _Hercules_ had beaten the latest Armstrong achievement, a\r\n12½-ton 300-pounder. And on this pretext, and judging the defensive\r\npower of the whole ship by the defensive power of the thickest patch of\r\nits armour, a still more powerful gun was demanded for the navy by the\r\ninventor and by the press: a 25-ton 600-pounder.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly the power of ordnance grew. It has been observed that of\r\nthis feverish evolution of armour and artillery the circumstances\r\nwere doubly remarkable. Firstly, no foreign pressure existed which\r\ncalled for such overleaping and experimental advances. The Americans\r\nstill clung to their smooth-bore system; the French, who like us had\r\nadopted breech-loading guns, retained the system in their service and\r\nsuffered for some years from its continuous inefficiency. Secondly,\r\nthe navy was itself “unwillingly dragged into the cul-de-sac of\r\nexperimental construction induced by the clamour of public opinion.”\r\nThe type, the size of the gun which was to be embodied in our latest\r\nwarships, was decided mainly by forces outside the navy, and changed\r\nfrom year to year. Naval architecture changed with it. The adoption\r\nof the succession of increasingly powerful rifled guns set experts at\r\ntheir wit’s ends devising warships suitable for carrying them; entailed\r\ncontinuous alterations both in the armaments of new ships and in the\r\ndesign of the new ships themselves; but also, as it happened, had the\r\neffect of giving this country a mastery over naval material which it\r\nhas never since surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe type having been decided for each individual vessel, there remained\r\nthe question of the disposition of the armament.\r\n\r\nTwo main considerations guided the evolution of the ironclads of\r\nthis period in respect of the disposition of their guns: one mainly\r\ntactical, the other mainly constructive. It appears probable that, from\r\nthe date of Trafalgar onward, the limitations of merely broadside fire\r\nhad been realized; that the end-on attack, such as had obtained in the\r\nsupreme actions fought by Nelson and Rodney, had shown the weakness\r\nof the broadside ship in ahead fire and had made obvious the anomaly\r\nthat, in all ships-of-the-line, the course of the ship, the direction\r\nin which the attack was made, was the very direction in which gunfire\r\nwas least powerful, if not altogether non-existent. With the coming of\r\nsteam and the consequent growth of the ram and ramming tactics, this\r\nanomaly was more and more apparent; and from the _Warrior_ onwards\r\neach new type presented an enhanced effort to provide, particularly,\r\nahead fire. The growth of the gun materially assisted this effort.\r\nAhead fire increased, between the years 1860 and 1880, from zero to a\r\nlarge proportion of the total fire. The broadside ship was for a time\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe constructive consideration was the requirement of a protected\r\narmament capable of the maximum effective fire in all directions. In\r\nthe first half of the century an increased effectiveness had been\r\nobtained, with the old-fashioned truck guns, by adaptation of the ports\r\nor by use of specially designed carriages, to permit of as large an arc\r\nof training as possible. Even so the arc through which guns could be\r\nfired was small, and in the case of the 68-pounder of the _Warrior_ was\r\nonly thirty degrees before and abaft the beam. The demand for greater\r\nutility was emphasized when, with the increase in size of the unit gun,\r\nthe number of pieces carried by each ship was diminished.\r\n\r\nHow, then, having regard to these two considerations, should a\r\nwarship’s guns be disposed? Various methods were adopted. In the first\r\ninstance, it was seen to be possible to augment the ahead fire of a\r\nship, and to give a wide sweep of training to some of her guns, by\r\nindenting the sides; by so shaping the ship’s side-plating as to allow\r\nguns mounted in the forward part to fire in the direction of the ship’s\r\nlongitudinal axis. At first, slight use was made of this method: with\r\nthe fine lines given to iron ships it appeared practicable in only a\r\nsmall degree. Moreover, it was objected to as causing a “funnelling”\r\neffect to the path of fragments of enemy shell or shot; it was found\r\nthat shrapnel shell, fired at indented embrasures at Shoebury, broke\r\nup, and the number of balls which entered the portholes was ten times\r\nthe number which entered similar portholes on a straight side. But,\r\nafter the _Minotaur_ class, less length and greater beam were given\r\nto ships, and recessed ports and indented sides therefore became more\r\nfeasible.\r\n\r\nAs guns increased in weight and individual importance the advantages\r\nof concentration became apparent. It was now undoubtedly desirable\r\nto protect _all_ the guns; yet, if they had been strung out along\r\nthe whole length of the ship, the weight, both of the guns and their\r\nprotective armour, would prove to be an excessive burden to the ship.\r\nHence the advantage of the _central battery_. By concentrating the guns\r\ninto a central area, an armoured box amidships, the weight of armour\r\nnecessary to protect them could be kept within reasonable limits,\r\nprotection was afforded not only to the guns but to the vital parts\r\nof the ship, while at the same time the extremities were left lightly\r\nloaded. The complete water-line belt of armour was retained, but,\r\nboth in the French and in the English navy, the system of complete\r\nprotection as embodied in the _Gloire_ and _Warrior_ was given up.\r\n\r\nThis device of the central battery was at first used solely for\r\nbroadside guns. But the desire for ahead fire from behind armour soon\r\ncaused the adaptation of the battery to allow it. Ports were cut in\r\nthe two transverse bulkheads, the ship’s sides were indented, suitable\r\ngun-mountings were provided whereby some of the battery guns could be\r\nshifted from one porthole to another; and in this way it was secured\r\nthat a fair proportion of the armament could be fired either on the\r\nbeam or parallel with the keel-line of the ship. A power of offence was\r\ngiven in all directions, and no “point of impunity” existed.\r\n\r\nIngenious were the arrangements resorted to, to obtain the maximum\r\neffect from the new medium-sized artillery which superseded the\r\noriginal truck-guns of the _Warrior_ and former warships. The armoured\r\nboxes, instead of being made with their sides respectively parallel,\r\nand at right angles, to the sides of the ship, were sometimes set\r\ndiagonally, with their sides at forty-five degrees with fore-and-aft.\r\nSometimes they were octagonal, sometimes with curved bulkheads,\r\nsometimes two batteries were superposed one on the other; but always\r\nthe desire was to utilize each gun over as large as possible an arc\r\nof fire, and always the tendency was to augment the ahead fire. The\r\ncentral battery formed a powerful citadel covering the whole beam\r\nof the ship amidships. The guns of this citadel, by the power of\r\nmanœuvring given by the adoption of twin-screw propelling machinery,\r\ncould, it was argued, be brought to bear in any direction desired. Of\r\nall directions, “right ahead” was considered to be of the greatest\r\nimportance. End-on fighting, it was assumed, would always be resorted\r\nto in future; and it was the power of keeping the ship end-on to the\r\nenemy which was the great military advantage conferred by twin screws.\r\n\r\nA further step in the direction of giving to each gun a large arc of\r\nfire was taken in the introduction of the sponson. By means of this\r\ncircular platform, projecting from the vessel’s side, a gun could be\r\ncarried so as to fire through an arc of 180 degrees. The same system\r\nobtained largely in the French ships of this period; by mounting guns\r\nin overhung circular turntables, one at each corner of the central\r\nbattery _en caponière_, a large effective arc was obtained for them.\r\n\r\nOnly one step more was necessary: that which would allow each gun to\r\ncommand the whole sweep of the horizon, and to be available for duty\r\nupon either beam and any bearing: the adoption of the _centre-line\r\nturret_. But before tracing the evolution of the turret, let us\r\nrecapitulate the typical ships built between 1860 and 1873 which\r\ncomposed our central-battery fleet.\r\n\r\nThe germ of the central-battery idea may be seen, perhaps, in the\r\nbelted _Minotaur_, in which, in order to allow the chase guns to be\r\nfought from behind armour, a transverse armour bulkhead was worked, at\r\na distance of some 25 feet aft of the bow. Had foreign influence not\r\nexerted itself it may be supposed with reason that from the _Minotaur_\r\nthe central battery would have been evolved. However this may be, the\r\nevolution was hastened by French initiative; for in each of the two\r\nwooden ships _Magenta_ and _Solferino_, laid down in ’59, was found a\r\ncomplete two-decked central battery whose whole depth was faced with\r\narmour for the protection of fifty-two 5-ton cannon, the rest of the\r\nship’s water-line being protected by an armour belt much narrower than\r\nthat of the _Gloire_. In imitation of this plan our own designs were\r\nprepared; and gradually, and only by a series of steps, we achieved\r\nwhat our rivals had obtained in a single stride.\r\n\r\nIn ’63 Sir Edward Reed, at that time Mr. Reed, one of the graduates of\r\nthe school which in ’48 had been established at Portsmouth Dockyard,\r\nwas appointed to the office of Chief Constructor of the Navy. Possessed\r\nof broad and original views and gifted to an unusual degree in the arts\r\nof exposition and argument, he made himself responsible for designs of\r\nwarships differing widely from their large and unwieldy precursors. The\r\nfirst of these was the _Bellerophon_, a short and easily manœuvred,\r\nfully rigged belt-and-battery ship, carrying ten 12-ton Armstrong guns\r\nfor broadside fire in the battery, and two 6-ton guns for ahead fire\r\nin a small armoured battery in the bows. Not only in the disposition\r\nof her armament was the _Bellerophon_ different from all former ships.\r\nShe was a radical departure from existing practice in many important\r\nrespects. Constructionally, she was built on a new “bracket-frame”\r\nsystem designed to give great girder strength for small expenditure of\r\nweight, already in vogue for mercantile shipping. The use of watertight\r\ncompartments was extended as a defence against an enemy ram, the system\r\nof double bottoms was extended as a consequence of the introduction of\r\nthe torpedo. A powerful ram was carried, but the bow took a new form;\r\na U- instead of a V-section was adopted in order to give buoyancy\r\nand thus minimize the tendency to plunge which was inherent in a\r\nfine-bowed ship; the section near the water-line being fined away so\r\nas to form a cut-water. Steel was largely used instead of iron, with\r\na consequent saving of weight. A novel trim was given her--six feet\r\nby the stern--to give a deep immersion for the powerful screw and to\r\nassist the ship in turning quickly on her heel under the action of\r\nthe balanced rudder; an adjustment which experience showed to have a\r\ndetrimental effect on the propulsive efficiency.\r\n\r\nNext came the _Enterprise_, a still smaller ship. In the _Bellerophon_,\r\nas we have seen, there was no bow fire possible from the central\r\nbattery; in the _Enterprise_ this was obtained by piercing the\r\nathwartship bulkheads of the battery with ports, and substituting\r\nmovable for fixed bulwarks. The same arrangement was developed in the\r\n_Pallas_ and _Penelope_, in which ships the arc of fire of the corner\r\nguns of the battery was further extended by the device of indented\r\nsides. Then came the _Hercules_, generally like the _Bellerophon_ but\r\nwith indented sides and, as a novelty, alternative ports in the battery\r\narmour by means of which the corner guns could be trained, on revolving\r\nplatforms, to fire either on the beam or nearly in line with the keel;\r\na system which presented an obvious disadvantage in requiring twelve\r\nports for eight guns. In the _Kaiser_ class, designed by Sir Edward\r\nReed shortly afterwards for the German government, this disadvantage\r\nwas obviated by the expedient of forming ports in facets of the battery\r\nset at forty-five degrees with the keel-line, and by muzzle-pivoting\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nBoth in the _Bellerophon_ and the _Hercules_ axial fire had only been\r\nobtained by the provision of special batteries, at the bow and stern,\r\nof partially protected guns. Now, this accumulation of weight at the\r\nextremities was a feature viewed with disfavour by naval opinion;\r\nmoreover, these bow batteries did not meet the ever-growing demand\r\nfor a considerable ahead fire. So in the _Sultan_, which carried a\r\ncentral-battery armament similar to that of the _Hercules_, an upper\r\ndeck armoured battery was embodied, superposed on the after end of\r\nthe main deck battery and carrying guns which gave both astern and\r\nbeam fire; while, for bow fire, two 12-ton guns were mounted in the\r\nforecastle, but without any protection.\r\n\r\nThe central-battery system had now to sustain the greatest attack that\r\nhad yet been made upon it by the advocates of centre-line turrets. The\r\nposition of the central-battery school was already somewhat shaken;\r\nordnance had grown to a weight and power which justified the main\r\nargument of the turret advocates; Lissa had just shown the importance\r\nof being able to concentrate on any one bearing a maximum of offensive\r\npower. Controversy raged hotly on the relative merits of turret and\r\ncentral battery.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Admiralty in ’68 determined to consider both\r\ntypes, with a view to embodying the best arrangement in the new class\r\nof vessels then projected. The principal shipbuilders of the country\r\nwere invited to compete, and were presented with specifications for\r\na first-class warship so widely drawn as to leave them the greatest\r\nlatitude in design. Of the seven designs submitted, three were of the\r\ncentral-battery type, three were turret ships, and one a compound of\r\nthe two. After comparison with an Admiralty design produced by Sir\r\nEdward Reed, it was decided to adopt this in preference to those of\r\nthe private firms, and to build a whole class of six ships to it. The\r\nresult was the _Audacious_ class--of which the best-remembered are\r\nthe _Iron Duke_ and the ill-fated _Vanguard_. In this class a strong\r\nall-round fire was obtained by arranging two central batteries of the\r\nsame size, one on the main and one on the upper deck. The main deck\r\nbattery had only broadside ports for its six 12-ton guns, each gun\r\ntraining thirty degrees before and abaft the beam; the upper deck\r\nbattery had four guns of the same calibre mounted at ports cut in\r\narmour facets at forty-five degrees with the keel-line, and training\r\nthrough ninety degrees. To allow axial fire from these guns the upper\r\nbattery was made to project slightly, sponson fashion, over the sides\r\nof the ship, and the bulwarks forward and aft of the battery were set\r\nslightly back toward the centre line to enable the guns to fire past\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA final stage in the evolution of the central-battery ship was attained\r\nin the _Alexandra_, laid down in ’72. The type had proved tenacious\r\nof life, and, for masted vessels, still held its own up to this point\r\nagainst the turret system. The design for the _Alexandra_ gave as\r\ncomplete an all-round fire as was attainable in a central-battery\r\nironclad; for the first time, it was said, we really had a masted ship\r\nwith satisfactory all-round fire. Generally like the _Audacious_ class,\r\nthe _Alexandra_ possessed an advantage in that the two forward guns of\r\nthe upper deck battery were 25 ton instead of 18 ton, and in having,\r\nin addition to the six broadside guns of the main deck battery, two\r\nadditional 18-ton guns mounted so as to be capable of firing nearly\r\nahead and on the beam as well. Designed to fulfil the requirements of\r\n“end-on” fighting, she made a heavy sacrifice of broadside fire to\r\nobtain a maximum of bow fire; and at a later date, when a different\r\nvaluation had come to be placed on axial fire, this sacrifice was\r\nnoted against her. “She could only take her place at a disadvantage in\r\nany form of battle which was suited to the armaments of the ironclads\r\nthat had gone before her.”[167] Nevertheless she was a formidable\r\nvessel. Defensively, too, she was pronounced to be conspicuously\r\nsuccessful; her armour belt, which attained a thickness of 12 inches\r\nat the water-line amidships, was carried down at the bow to cover and\r\nstrengthen the stem, and to protect the vessel from a raking fire. For\r\nthe protection of the stern against a raking fire, an armour bulkhead\r\nwas worked across the after part, extending to a depth of 6 feet below\r\nthe water-line.\r\n\r\nThe _Alexandra_ was the last of the purely “central battery”\r\nships.[168] By the time she was launched experience had set the seal of\r\napproval on another type, to the evolution of which we must now revert.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace to its source the invention of the armoured\r\ngun-turret. The inventive Ericsson is said to have envisaged at an\r\nearly age the idea of a protected gun carried on a mobile raft, “an\r\nidea probably inspired by his river-rafts in Sweden”; and it is known\r\nthat at a later date he planned in detail a primitive monitor, the\r\ndesign of which at the outbreak of the Crimean War he offered to\r\nNapoleon III. Perhaps the idea, which M. Paixhans first developed in\r\npublic, of applying iron armour to a sea-going ship, induced the idea\r\nof a pivot-gun protected by an armour shield. A protected armament\r\nwas found, as we have seen, in the French batteries built for the\r\nassault of Kinburn: the armoured vessel and the armoured gun were first\r\nembodied in the same unit; and though these units were the first to be\r\ntried in actual war, yet some years previously, in 1842 or thereabouts,\r\na Mr. Stevens of New York had proposed and made an armoured floating\r\nbattery. But in neither of these instances was the gun in a turret.\r\nThe turret idea, like so many other inventions, had an independent\r\ndevelopment in Europe and in America. In each case war supplied the\r\nincentive. In America, in ’62, Ericsson himself produced in a national\r\nemergency the _Monitor_, the low, shallow-draft armoured vessel\r\ncarrying two 11-inch Dahlgren guns in a steam-rotated turret which\r\nserved to counter the Southern _Merrimac_, the rasée with the fixed\r\npenthouse armour roof over its guns which the Confederates had built by\r\nthe light of French experience.\r\n\r\nThe _Monitor_, both in design and in the circumstances of its\r\nproduction, was a great achievement; its success gave sanction to the\r\nrevolving turret as a form of structure by means of which a big gun\r\ncould be carried and trained. Nevertheless it is doubtful whether it\r\ninfluenced to an appreciable degree the evolution of the sea-going\r\nturret ship on this side of the Atlantic. Already, when the _Monitor_\r\nfought her action with the _Merrimac_, the turret had been adopted in\r\ncoast-defence ships ordered for European powers; and, dramatic though\r\nit was, the incident of Hampton Roads afforded merely a confirmation\r\nof the effectiveness of the turret form of gun mounting. It was to an\r\nepisode of the Crimean War that the development of the sea-going turret\r\nship was directly due.\r\n\r\nIn the Sea of Azov, in the spring of 1855, Commander Cowper Coles, of\r\nH.M. steamer _Stromboli_, constructed in a single night, of barrels,\r\nspars and boards, a raft capable of bearing heavy artillery, which he\r\nnamed the _Lady Nancy_; by means of which he brought within range and\r\ndestroyed by shell fire the Russian stores at Taganrog.\r\n\r\nThe naval operations of this war had drawn general attention to the\r\nspecial problems in connection with the navigation of shallow waters by\r\nvessels with a heavy armament, and Commander Coles’ exploit immediately\r\nexcited official interest. Models of armed rafts were submitted by him\r\nfor Admiralty inspection, and shortly afterwards he was himself ordered\r\nhome to give advice upon the requirements of this form of construction:\r\nin connection with which the necessity for armour protection for the\r\ngun or guns was a point early insisted on by him. In that same year he\r\nsketched a design for a belted shallow-draught vessel for the attack of\r\nstationary forts which he equipped with guns of the heaviest pattern,\r\neach working in a fixed hemispherical shield. From the fixed shield\r\nto a revolving turret was a small step. In a short time Commander\r\nColes made himself the enthusiastic exponent of armour-protected guns,\r\nmounted in cupolas or turrets on or near the centre-line of a ship so\r\nas to give a command over nearly the whole sweep of the horizon. By\r\nsuch a system, he argued, a vessel could be endowed with a concentrated\r\noffensive power on any bearing unapproachable by broadside armament,\r\nhowever designed; all guns were effective on almost any bearing without\r\ndiverting the ship, their force required no evolution to elicit,\r\nexisting as it did when the ship was at anchor, in dry dock or on a\r\nconstant course. The height of the turrets gave them a plunging fire,\r\nan effect particularly useful now that ships’ sides were armoured and\r\ntheir decks alone remained penetrable.\r\n\r\nHis advocacy of the turret system, aided by the technical assistance\r\nof Mr. Brunel, made a deep impression on a large section of the public\r\nand gained the interest of the Prince Consort. He did not profess the\r\ntechnical knowledge of a shipbuilder or designer; but in his insistence\r\non the advantages to be derived from the method of mounting guns on the\r\ncentre-line he wielded arguments of great natural force, and enlisted\r\nin his favour the professional sympathies of eminent builders and naval\r\nmen. In 1860 he produced before the newly founded Institution of Naval\r\nArchitects a plan of a sea-going ship carrying nine turrets, seven on\r\nthe centre-line and two off-set so as to allow ahead fire from three\r\nturrets. In the following year he wrote to the Admiralty undertaking\r\nto prove that a vessel could be built on his principle of armament\r\n100 feet shorter than the _Warrior_ and in all military respects her\r\nsuperior: “I will guarantee to disable and capture her in an hour; she\r\nshall draw four foot less water, require only half the crew, and cost\r\nthe country for building at least £100,000 less. I am ready to stand or\r\nfall on these assertions.”\r\n\r\nSuch a pronouncement could not be lightly passed over. Moreover,\r\ncoast-defence vessels embodying the turret system--light-draught\r\nvessels characterized by small tonnage, small cost and indifferent\r\nsea-going qualities, in combination with massive protection and a large\r\noffensive armament--were already being built by the private firms of\r\nthis country for various foreign powers. In ’61, for instance, Denmark\r\nhad ordered the _Rolf Krake_, a turret gunboat carrying a 4½-inch belt\r\nand four 68-pounder guns, a pair in each of two armoured turrets; which\r\nthree years later proved her value in action against a nominally\r\nsuperior force. Prussia had ordered her first ironclad, a turret\r\nship. Holland, Italy, Brazil, Russia--all were known to be purchasing\r\ncoast-defence vessels of the turret type. And two sea-going turret\r\nships which had been ordered by the American Confederates, and which\r\nwere building in this country--the _Wyvern_ and _Scorpion_--had been\r\nseized and purchased by our government.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances the Admiralty, though there was a preponderance\r\nof official opinion against the idea, resolved to countenance the\r\nturret system and give it a trial. The _Royal Sovereign_ was cut down\r\nfrom a three-decker of 120 guns, armoured with a 5½-inch belt and a\r\n1-inch deck, and equipped with four turrets carrying a total of five\r\n12½-ton guns--two in the foremost and one in the remaining turrets. At\r\nthe same time the _Prince Albert_, also a four-turret ship, was laid\r\ndown by the firm of Samuda to an Admiralty order. These ships were\r\na distinct success so far as the armament was concerned. They were\r\ncertainly not ocean-going ships. There were many faults and undesirable\r\nfeatures to be found in them. But the disposition of the armament was\r\nfound satisfactory, and the captain of the _Royal Sovereign_ reported\r\nmost favourably of his ship, describing her as the most formidable\r\nman-of-war; “her handiness, speed, weight of broadside, and the small\r\ntarget she offers, increase tenfold her powers of assault and retreat.”\r\n\r\nTime, and the progress of artillery, were on the side of Captain Cowper\r\nColes. He saw, and the Admiralty advisers felt, that although it was\r\npossible to work existing guns on the broadside, yet increase in the\r\nsize and weight of guns would sooner or later necessitate the mounting\r\nof them on accurately balanced turntables secured by central pivots\r\non the centre-line. Only by such a method could the largest gun be\r\nworked and the full weight of metal be poured, as required, on either\r\nbroadside. In fact the turret, the original object of which was purely\r\ndefensive, was now regarded from a quite different point of view: as a\r\nconvenient device by which guns of the highest calibre could be carried\r\nand worked. Was complicated machinery objected to? The common winch,\r\nthe rack and pinion, were in constant use on every railway turntable,\r\nnor had the American turrets ever failed in action or caused a loss\r\nof confidence in their reliability. Reliance upon a central pivot was\r\ndisliked? Yet the pivot was already in use for holding the broadside\r\nguns of our ironclads--a mere bolt 4 inches in diameter and itself\r\nexposed to gunfire.[169]\r\n\r\nThe Admiralty constructors were insistent on the practical difficulties\r\nwhich lay in the way of designing a satisfactory sea-going turret ship.\r\nThe advantages which had been claimed for turrets were obvious, said\r\nSir Edward Reed; the larger and heavier the individual gun, the greater\r\nthe gain of mounting it in a turret. But enthusiastic advocates of\r\nthis method lost sight of the fact that turrets were incompatible with\r\nmasts and sails, and with the forecastle and high freeboard necessary\r\nfor good sea-going qualities. At that time, 1865, it was possible to\r\nprotect and work eight of the largest guns, mounted on the broadside,\r\nwith as little expenditure of weight as would be required to mount four\r\nof the guns two in a turret on the centre-line; while in the latter\r\ncase they could only fire in two different directions at the same time,\r\nwhereas in the former they could fire in eight.\r\n\r\nIn order to allow both sides in the controversy to come to grips with\r\nthe practical difficulties, a committee was formed at the Admiralty in\r\nMay, ’65, and Captain Coles was asked to produce a turret-ship design\r\nby the aid of a draughtsman and with the drawings of the _Pallas_ for\r\nguidance. His design, a vessel showing two 600-pounders each mounted\r\nin a centre-line cupola, was not considered suitable. So the Board\r\nresolved to build a ship to Sir Edward Reed’s design--a fully rigged\r\nand masted, high-freeboard ship, with an armour belt and protected bow\r\nand stern batteries, and with two centre-line turrets amidships mounted\r\nover a central battery, each carrying two 25-ton 600-pounder guns. This\r\nwas the _Monarch_. She was the first truly ocean-going turret ship,\r\nand her performances at sea in ’69 in company with central-battery\r\nships like the _Bellerophon_ and _Hercules_ proved her to be a valuable\r\nand efficient unit; by this experiment it was demonstrated, said Mr.\r\nBrassey, “that it was practicable to design a thoroughly seaworthy\r\nturret ship, although for sea-going purposes a central battery presents\r\ngreat advantages over the turret system.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Captain Coles had protested vigorously against the\r\ndesign of the _Monarch_ as representative of his system. The plan was\r\nnot his; the turrets were mounted so high that there was a large area\r\nto protect and the ship, unlike the low-freeboard ships of his own\r\ndesign, presented a large target. But his chief objection was, that\r\nthe presence of a forecastle and an armoured bow battery annihilated\r\nthe whole advantage of turret guns by preventing ahead fire from them.\r\nAfter protracted negotiations he obtained Admiralty permission to have\r\na ship built to satisfy his own views and independently of criticism\r\nfrom Admiralty officials. In ’69 the _Captain_, built by Messrs. Laird\r\nto his drawings, was launched at Birkenhead. The _Captain_, although\r\ngenerally similar to the _Monarch_ (the growth of artillery limited\r\nthe number of the turrets to two), differed from her in one important\r\nrespect: her designed freeboard was only 8 feet as compared with 14;\r\nand, by some error in calculation, this dimension proved to be only\r\n6 feet when the vessel was in sea-going trim. This low freeboard,\r\nin conjunction with her large sail-area, produced a condition of\r\ninstability at large angles of heel which led to disaster and sealed\r\nthe doom of the fully rigged turret ship.\r\n\r\nEven in the _Captain_ ahead fire was not found possible. In the\r\noriginal plans she had the low freeboard favoured by her designer;\r\nbut in the later plans poops and forecastles were added to give the\r\nnecessary sea-going qualities, and ahead fire was thereby sacrificed.\r\nComplete mastage was given her: iron masts in the form of tripods\r\nto avoid the use of shrouds and to give as clear an arc of fire as\r\npossible. The rigging was all stopped short at, and worked from, a\r\nnarrow flying deck which was built above the turrets. This flying deck\r\nprovided a working space for the crew, who in a moderately rough sea\r\nwould not be able to make use of the low upper deck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE _MONARCH_\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by Symonds, Portsmouth]\r\n\r\nOn the night of September 6th, 1870, the _Captain_ capsized in a heavy\r\nsea off C. Finisterre. In St. Paul’s Cathedral the memorial brass,\r\nerected in commemoration of this disaster, records that the _Captain_\r\nwas built in deference to public opinion expressed in parliament and\r\nthrough other channels, and in opposition to the views and opinions of\r\nthe Controller and his department; and that the evidence all tended to\r\nshow that they generally disapproved of her construction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of combining the turret system with a full rig of masts\r\nand sails had for a long time been recognized. Some eighteen months\r\nbefore the loss of the _Captain_, the Admiralty, in the presence of the\r\nincreasing efficiency of steam machinery, had decided to construct a\r\nmastless sea-going turret ship.\r\n\r\nAmerican experience greatly influenced this decision. In America, where\r\nthe principle of machinery for propulsion and for working the guns had\r\nbeen accepted with a greater readiness than in Europe, the line of\r\ndevelopment had been more direct. From the original _Monitor_ a whole\r\nseries of derivatives had been produced, and from coast-defence vessels\r\nof a single turret advance had been made to ocean-going mastless\r\nturret ships of low freeboard, carrying the largest smooth-bore guns.\r\nThese ocean monitors, lacking though they did some features which were\r\nconsidered indispensable in British warships, yet exerted an undoubted\r\ninfluence upon our own construction. Weakly designed in many respects,\r\nwith small fuel capacity, and unsteady as gun platforms, they were\r\nregarded by some writers as the true progenitors of the class of\r\nwarship which now superseded the masted vessels of the ’sixties.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the naval architect henceforth was greatly simplified.\r\nMasts and sails, which had in the past proved such an embarrassment,\r\nwere now frankly abandoned, with the result that a thousand\r\ndifficulties which had beset the designer of the turret ship were swept\r\naway. No longer had the stability curve to conform to the conflicting\r\nrequirements of the sailing vessel and the gun platform. The large\r\nweight gained by dispensing with masts and sails could be embodied as\r\nan addition to the armament or to the fuel carried. The single screw,\r\nwhich in the case of a ship intended to use sails had been almost a\r\nnecessity, could be replaced by twin screws of greater power; and the\r\nchange would remove the liability of complete disablement, and give a\r\nnumber of constructive advantages which it is unnecessary to enumerate.\r\nIndeed, it may be said conversely, that the adoption of twin screws\r\nso improved the reliability of the propelling machinery as to make\r\npracticable the abandonment of masts and sails.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1869, the _Devastation_ was commenced. Designed by Sir\r\nEdward Reed, she “forestalled, rather than profited by, the dreadful\r\nlesson of the _Captain_ and by her success gave proof of the judgment\r\nand initiative of the Board and their adviser.” Sir Edward Reed had\r\nrecognized, more fully than his critics, the conflicting elements\r\ninherent in the rigged turret ship. And it is significant that, just\r\nat a time when the assured success of the _Monarch_ must have been a\r\ngratification to her designer, he should record: “My clear and strong\r\nconviction at the moment of writing these lines [March 31st, 1869] is\r\nthat no satisfactorily designed turret ship with rigging has yet been\r\nbuilt, or even laid down.”\r\n\r\nThe _Devastation_ design was a development of those of some previous\r\nmastless turret ships, the _Cerberus_, the _Hotspur_, and the\r\n_Glatton_ class, which had embodied Sir Edward Reed’s ideas as to the\r\nrequirements of coast-service vessels. At first given four 25-ton\r\nguns, the _Devastation_ was ultimately armed with four M.L. guns each\r\nweighing 35 tons and carried in turrets on the centre-line, one at\r\neach end of a central breastwork, 150 feet in length, built round the\r\nfunnels.\r\n\r\nThis central breastwork, raised above the upper deck and armoured along\r\nits sides with 10-inch steel, supported the two turrets and enabled\r\nthe guns to be carried at a desirable height above the water-line. The\r\nupper deck itself was low. The sides, up to its level, were protected\r\nby a complete belt of armour 8 inches in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of masts and rigging had a striking effect on the design.\r\nCompared with the _Monarch_, of nearly the same tonnage, she carried\r\nheavier guns, double the weight of armour, double the amount of fuel,\r\nand required little more than half the crew to work her.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the _Captain_, confirming the doubts which experts had\r\nexpressed as to the seaworthiness of rigged turret ships, caused an\r\nalarm for the safety of all turret ships, built and building. In\r\nthe public mind, in consequence of the reported shortcomings of the\r\nAmerican monitors and the known deficiencies of our coast-defence\r\nvessels, the belief was growing that the turret system was inherently\r\nunsafe. It was believed, also, that mastless ships, having no spread of\r\nsail to steady their motion, would be liable to excessive and dangerous\r\nrolling. To allay the uneasiness as to the safety of the _Devastation_\r\nand her type a Committee on Designs was formed. The Committee, composed\r\nof some of the most eminent of naval architects and officers, made a\r\nreport in the spring of ’71 which, though it met with considerable\r\nopposition from one school, nevertheless “formed the groundwork upon\r\nwhich the English Admiralty determined to construct their policy for\r\nthe future.” The Committee pronounced altogether against fully rigged\r\nships for the line of battle; it was impossible, in their opinion, to\r\ncombine in the same vessel great offensive and defensive power and\r\na full spread of canvas. They considered the _Devastation_ class as\r\nthe most suitable type of armoured ship for future service, and found\r\nthem to have sufficient stability for safety and to be in almost all\r\nrespects a satisfactory design of warship. As regards the _Devastation_\r\nherself they recommended some minor alterations, the effect of\r\nwhich was to improve the stability of the ship and to give greater\r\naccommodation for the crew. The main alteration consisted in the\r\ncarrying up of the ship’s sides amidships to the level of the central\r\nbreastwork, and in continuing the breastwork deck outward to the sides,\r\nto form unarmoured side superstructures.\r\n\r\nBesides the _Devastation_, two others of the type were laid down\r\nshortly afterwards, the _Thunderer_ and the _Dreadnought_. The three\r\nships differed from each other slightly in dimensions, but embodied\r\nthe same characteristic features. Of chief interest is the transition\r\nof the unarmoured side superstructures, in the _Devastation_, to\r\nan armoured central battery of the same width as the ship, in\r\nthe _Dreadnought_. The influence of Sir Edward Reed, who had now\r\ngiven place to Mr. Nathaniel Barnaby as Chief Constructor at the\r\nAdmiralty, was apparent in this evolution. In ’73 he stated publicly\r\nhis objections to the carrying up of the _Devastation’s_ sides, and\r\npictured a shell entering the unarmoured superstructure and blowing\r\nup all the light iron structure in front of the guns. The result\r\nwas seen in the _Dreadnought_, in which the breastwork was made a\r\ncontinuation of the ship’s side and armoured. More freeboard was also\r\ngiven to the forecastle and the after deck than was found in the\r\n_Devastation_ and _Thunderer_, with the desire to make the vessel drier\r\nand more comfortable; and, owing to the height at which the turrets\r\nwere carried, this was found possible without restricting the arcs\r\nof fire of the guns. The movement from the monitor type toward the\r\nmodern battleship in respect of freeboard is clearly traced in these\r\nthree ships of the _Devastation_ class. Low freeboard, in spite of its\r\neffect in rendering inconspicuous the ship in which it was embodied,\r\nwas gradually being abandoned. High freeboard was foreshadowed for\r\nfuture ships. The loss of the _Captain_ had led to a serious study, by\r\nnaval architects and mathematicians, of the stability of warships at\r\nlarge angles of rolling, and the advantages of high freeboard were by\r\nthis time widely appreciated. High freeboard not only made a ship more\r\nhabitable; by the form of stability curve it gave it allowed a vessel’s\r\nbeam to be reduced with safety, and thereby contributed to a steadier\r\nand more easily propelled ship than would have been obtained without it.\r\n\r\nIn other respects these three ships show the lines along which progress\r\nwas being made. In the turrets of the _Devastation_ the twin 35-ton\r\nguns had been loaded and worked by hand; but in the forward turret\r\nof the _Thunderer_ the new hydraulic system of Messrs. Armstrong was\r\napplied with success to two 38-ton 12-inch guns; and this system was\r\nadopted for both turrets of the _Dreadnought_. The guns were loaded\r\nexternally, the turrets being revolved by steam, after firing, till\r\nthe guns were on the requisite bearing; they were then depressed by\r\nhydraulic power, and the 700-pound projectiles were rammed into their\r\nmuzzles by a telescopic hydraulic rammer. In 1879 an accident occurred\r\nin the _Thunderer_ which helped, it is said, to hasten the return to\r\nbreech-loading guns. Simultaneous firing was being carried out; one\r\nof the guns missed fire without anyone either inside or outside the\r\nturret being aware of it. The guns were loaded again, and, on being\r\ndischarged, one of them burst. Such double-loading, it was clearly\r\nseen, would not have obtained with breech-loading guns.\r\n\r\nThe _Devastation_ had twin screws driven by independent engines, but\r\nthese were non-compound engines of the trunk type working with a\r\nmaximum steam pressure of 30 lbs. per square inch. In the _Dreadnought_\r\nan advance had been made to compound the three-cylinder vertical\r\nengines, working with 60 lbs. per square inch in engine-rooms divided\r\nby a longitudinal watertight bulkhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the battleship was being forced along at a hot pace\r\nby the evolution of artillery. No sooner had the mastless turret ship\r\nreceived the sanction of the Committee on Designs as the standard\r\ntype for warfare of the immediate future, than a sudden increase in\r\nthe power of guns necessitated the consideration of new principles and\r\nbrought into being a new type.\r\n\r\nSo far, defence had managed to compete fairly successfully with\r\noffence; the naval architect, by devoting as much as 25 per cent of the\r\ntotal of a ship’s weight to protective armour, had been able to keep\r\nlevel with the artillerist. But it was clear that he could not follow\r\nmuch further, by the existing methods. Armour could not be thickened\r\nindefinitely. Penetrable armour was no better than none; worse, in\r\nfact, since it was a superfluity, and in a ship a superfluity was\r\ndoubly wasteful, implying a loss of strength in some other direction.\r\nArmour might have to go altogether? It seemed that, after all, the\r\npredictions of Sir Howard Douglas might well come true; that, just as\r\ngunpowder had forced the foot soldier, after burdening him with an\r\never-increasing weight, to dispense altogether with body-armour, so\r\nrifled artillery would render ship armour increasingly ineffectual and,\r\neventually, an altogether useless encumbrance.\r\n\r\nThe advance in artillery took place in connection with Italian\r\nconstruction. In 1872 Italy laid down the _Duilio_, and a year later\r\nthe _Dandolo_, two mastless turret ships of a novel class, engined by\r\nPenn and Maudsley, and equipped with two diagonally placed turrets each\r\ndesigned to carry two 60-ton Armstrong guns; guns which were afterwards\r\nchanged to 100-ton guns of 17¾ inches bore. In the same ships the\r\nItalians introduced a solution of the armour difficulty. They abandoned\r\nvertical armour altogether, except for a very thick belt over the\r\ncentral portion of each vessel which was to protect the vital machinery\r\nand the gun turrets.\r\n\r\nThe reply to these was the _Inflexible_, laid down in ’74.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how, in the last of the _Devastation_ class,\r\nthe central armoured breastwork was widened to the full beam of the\r\nship. It had been proposed by Mr. Barnaby to take advantage of this\r\narrangement to off-set the two turrets of the _Dreadnought_ at a\r\ndistance each side of the centre line of the ship, so as to allow\r\na powerful ahead fire. Although not then approved, this suggestion\r\nwas embodied in the _Inflexible_ as her most distinctive feature. In\r\nthis, however, she was forestalled by the Italians. Her two turrets,\r\neach weighing 750 tons, were carried diagonally on a central armoured\r\ncitadel plated with compound armour of a maximum thickness of 24\r\ninches. Forward and aft of this citadel the unarmoured ends were\r\nbuilt flush with it, and along the centre line was built, the whole\r\nlength of the ship, a narrow superstructure. This superstructure did\r\nnot contribute anything to her stability; nor was such contribution\r\nneeded in view of the comparatively high freeboard. But it rendered\r\nunnecessary a flying deck such as had been fitted in the _Devastation_\r\nclass, and provided accommodation for the crew, without restricting to\r\nany appreciable degree the arcs of fire of the big guns.\r\n\r\nThe _Inflexible_ was of over 11,000 tons displacement, the heaviest\r\nand most powerful warship that had ever been built. She was 320 feet\r\nin length and 75 feet broad at the water-line; this unprecedented beam\r\nbeing required, in spite of the high freeboard, on account of the\r\nheight at which the turrets were carried. Nevertheless, so improved\r\nwas her propulsive efficiency as compared with that of former ships,\r\nso great the gain resulting from Mr. Froude’s historic researches on\r\nship form and the action of propellers, that a speed of 15 knots was\r\nobtained at a relatively small expense in horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe idea of sails was not yet altogether dead. In deference to a strong\r\nnaval opinion she was originally designed to carry two pole masts,\r\nwith sails for steadying her motion in a seaway and as a standby in\r\nthe event of her propelling machinery being disabled. But this scheme\r\nwas modified owing to the possibility of falling masts and rigging\r\ninterfering with the working of guns and screw in action. It was\r\ndecided that she should be brig-rigged for peace service; and that,\r\non an anticipation of war, she should be docked to allow the cruising\r\nmasts to be removed and replaced by two short iron masts without yards\r\nfor signalling and for carrying crows’ nests.\r\n\r\nBut it was in the bold abandonment of armour for the ends of the ship\r\nand its concentration on the sides of the citadel that the _Inflexible_\r\ndesign was most freely criticized. Armour, except in the form of an\r\nunder-water protective deck, was not used at all forward and aft of the\r\ncitadel. The ends of the ship were left unprotected, but subdivided;\r\nthe compartments near the water-line formed watertight tanks filled\r\nwith coals, stores, or--next to the side of the ship--cork. This\r\ncriticism was directed from two directions.\r\n\r\nTo many naval men the attempt to beat the gun by adding to the\r\nthickness of the armour was a game no longer worth the candle. The\r\npoint of view, moreover, that the defensive power of a ship was\r\naccurately represented by the defensive power of an armour patch upon\r\nits side was condemned as altogether too partial and theoretical. The\r\nsame fallacy was abroad in respect of guns. “Men were apt to think\r\nand speak as if the mounting of a single excessively heavy gun in a\r\nship would make her exceptionally powerful, no matter what number of\r\npowerful, but still less powerful, guns were displaced to make room for\r\nit. The targets and guns at Shoeburyness were held to be real measures\r\nof the defensive and offensive powers of ships.”[170]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, experience was at this time bringing to light the\r\ninefficiency of heavy naval artillery. In ’71 a paper by Captain Colomb\r\nattracted attention, in which he analysed the effective gun power of\r\nthe _Monarch_, and showed, by the light of experiments carried out by\r\nher against a rock off Vigo in company with _Captain_ and _Hercules_,\r\nthat “in six minutes from the opening of her fire on the sister ship at\r\n1000 yards, she will have fired twelve shot, of which one will have hit\r\nand another may have glanced, and it remains an even chance whether the\r\nsingle hit will have penetrated the enemy’s armour.” In the following\r\nsummer Mr. Barnaby was himself impressed with the difficulty which the\r\n_Hotspur_ experienced in hitting the turret of the _Glatton_ at a range\r\nof 200 yards in the smooth water of Portland Harbour: an experiment\r\nwhich, while confirming confidence in the reliability of a turret and\r\nits power to withstand shock, led him to question whether we were wise\r\nto put so much weight into the protection of turrets, and whether it\r\nmight not be a better plan to stint armour on guns in order to add to\r\ntheir number and power.\r\n\r\nFrom another direction the criticism was more directly effective.\r\nIn ’75 Sir Edward Reed, now a private member of parliament, made a\r\npronouncement on his return from a visit to Italy in the following\r\nwords: “The Italian ships _Duilio_ and _Dandolo_ are exposed, in my\r\nopinion, beyond all doubt or question, to speedy destruction. I fear\r\nI can only express my apprehension that the Italians are pursuing a\r\ntotally wrong course, and one which is likely to result in disaster.”\r\nThe Italian Minister of Marine indignantly refuted the assertion,\r\nbased as it must have been (he said) on incomplete information; and\r\nthe construction of the _Duilio_ and the _Dandolo_ proceeded. But the\r\nremarks of the ex-Chief Constructor applied with equal force to the\r\n_Inflexible_; and in the following session he stated as much in the\r\nHouse of Commons. It was possible, he insisted, that in an action the\r\ncork and stores which filled the unarmoured ends of the _Inflexible_\r\nmight be shot away, and the ends riddled and water-logged; and that in\r\nsuch an event the citadel, though intact, would not have sufficient\r\nstability to save the ship from capsizing.\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Admiralty was to the effect that Sir Edward Reed had\r\nassumed an extreme case, and that such a complete destruction as he\r\nhad envisaged was, even if possible, never likely to occur in a naval\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe effect of both statements was to cause widespread anxiety in the\r\npublic mind, and a lamentable loss of confidence in the projected\r\nwarship. A decision was therefore made to appoint another Committee, of\r\nunquestioned eminence and freedom from bias, to investigate and report\r\non the _Inflexible_ design. In due course the Committee reported. They\r\nconfirmed in a long statement the Admiralty point of view that the\r\ncomplete penetration and water-logging of the unarmoured ends of the\r\nship, and the blowing out of the whole of the stores and the cork by\r\nthe action of shell fire, was a very highly improbable contingency;\r\nthey found that the ship, if reduced to the extremest limit of\r\ninstability likely to occur, viz. with her ends completely riddled\r\nand water-logged, but with the stores and cork remaining and adding\r\nbuoyancy, would still possess a sufficient reserve both of buoyancy and\r\nof stability; and, balancing the vulnerability of the citadel with its\r\n24-inch armour and the destructibility of the unarmoured ends, they\r\ncame to the conclusion that the unarmoured ends were as well able as\r\nthe armoured citadel to bear the part assigned to them in encountering\r\nthe risks of naval warfare, and that therefore a just balance had been\r\nmaintained in the design, so that out of a given set of conditions a\r\ngood result had been obtained. Except that a recommendation was made\r\nthat the system of cork chambers should be extended, no structural\r\nalteration from the existing design was proposed.\r\n\r\nThe _Inflexible_ was followed by its smaller derivatives, the _Ajax_\r\nand _Agamemnon_, _Colossus_ and _Edinburgh_, and by the _Conqueror_, an\r\nimproved _Rupert_, with a single turret. Movement was in the direction\r\nof smaller displacements and less armour; construction was influenced\r\nat this time more by Italian than by French practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nAll through this transitional decade, 1870-80, experience and various\r\nnew developments were imperceptibly causing a gradual change of\r\nopinion as to what constituted the best type of battleship. At no\r\nperiod, perhaps, was the warship more obviously a compromise, at no\r\ntime were the limitations of size and weight more keenly felt. So many\r\nconsiderations interacted with one another, so conflicting were the\r\nclaims made of the naval architect, that it appeared indeed almost\r\nimpossible to embody them in a satisfactory design. (And yet nothing is\r\nmore remarkable than the unanimity with which designers, given certain\r\nconditions, arrived at the same final result: the _Duilio_ and the\r\n_Inflexible_ are a case in point.) Whatever the design might be, it\r\nwas open to powerful criticism. And the chief part of this criticism\r\nwas directed, as we have seen, against the use and disposition of the\r\narmour.\r\n\r\nIn ’73 Mr. Barnaby had questioned the wisdom of expending a large\r\nweight in the protection of turrets. Three years later Commander Noel,\r\nin a Prize Essay, was advocating unarmoured batteries, with a view\r\nto multiplying the number of battery guns, utilizing for offence the\r\nweight thus saved. In ’73 Mr. Barnaby had argued that the stinting of\r\narmour on the hull in order to thicken it on the battery would drive\r\nthe enemy to multiply his light and medium machine-guns. Within a few\r\nyears warships were bristling with Gatling and Gardner, Nordenfelt and\r\nHotchkiss guns, which by their presence gave a new value to armour,\r\nhowever thin. Mr. Froude, too, in his experiments in connection with\r\nthe _Inflexible_, brought into prominence the advantage which thin\r\narmour on a ship’s ends conferred on her stability. The idea of\r\nsubstituting cellular construction for armour was proving attractive.\r\nWhile the French continued to favour the complete water-line belt,\r\nthe Italians went to the limit in the _Italia_ and _Lepanto_, in\r\nwhich the water-line was left entirely unprotected by side armour.\r\nSuch armour as was carried was embodied in the form of a protective\r\ndeck, a feature found above water and in conjunction with a side belt\r\nin our _Devastation_ class, and under water and without side armour\r\nin the _Inflexible_ and smaller contemporary ships. The protective\r\ndeck, which covered the vitals of a ship and deflected shot and shell\r\nfrom its surface, was a device which found increasing favour with\r\nnaval architects. It was advocated by the Committee on Designs in\r\n’71 as possessing important advantages over a similar weight of side\r\narmour. If placed at some distance below water it formed the roof of\r\na submerged hull structure which was immune from damage by gun-fire,\r\nthe sides of this hull being protected sufficiently by sea-water. If,\r\nas was subsequently done, the protective deck were placed at a small\r\ndistance above water, and if the sides of it were bent down so as to\r\nmeet the ship’s sides at a distance below water beyond which a shot was\r\nunlikely to penetrate, the deck offered other advantages: the vital\r\nmachinery, though now partly above water, was still protected, the\r\nsloping parts of the deck being able to deflect shots which would have\r\npenetrated a much thicker vertical plate; moreover, if the ship’s sides\r\nwere riddled in action, the protective deck still preserved a large\r\nportion of the water-line area intact, and thereby secured her lateral\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nThe ram was still in favour, but opinion was slowly changing as to the\r\nnecessity for bow-fire. “It is my impression,” wrote Commander Noel in\r\n’76, “that too great a value was attached by some of the authorities,\r\ntwo or three years ago, to bow-fire; and that the manœuvring of a fleet\r\nin action will be more for the purpose of using the ram effectually,\r\nand the guns in broadsides on passing the enemy.” The firing of the\r\nheavy guns in the approach to ram was considered undesirable, owing\r\nto the obscuring of the scene by smoke. In short, bow-fire was not of\r\nprimary importance, and the disposition of armament which sought to\r\nobtain a concentration of bow-fire at the expense of broadside fire was\r\nbased on a false principle. Commander Noel advocated a broadside ship,\r\nof moderate tonnage, with an unarmoured battery of moderate-size guns,\r\nwith an armour belt round her water-line of 10-inch armour tapering\r\nto 5 inches forward and aft, and backed by wood and coal. Watertight\r\nsubdivisions he proposed as a defence against the ram and the torpedo.\r\n\r\nAs the decade progressed the navy and naval affairs were less and less\r\na subject of public interest. The design of warships continued to be\r\ndiscussed by a small circle, but the Board, alive to the transitional\r\nnature of the citadel ships, and under the influence of a national\r\nmovement for retrenchment and economy, had almost ceased to build. In\r\nthe three years ’76, ’77, and ’78 England laid down only two armoured\r\nbattleships, while France laid down a dozen. In ’78 four foreign ships\r\nbuilding in this country were hastily purchased on a Vote of Credit.\r\nBut by 1880 the French armoured navy was once more equal in strength to\r\nthat of England.\r\n\r\nThe gun, by its rapid evolution, was blocking design. The long debates\r\nover sails and steam had been settled; it was now the achievement of\r\npowerful breech-loading guns of large and small calibre which threw\r\nall existing ideas of warship design into the melting-pot. It became\r\nknown that the French at last possessed efficient breech-loading\r\nguns; and artillerists showed that, in spite of the inconvenience of\r\nlong-barrelled guns in ships, long barrels and slow-burning powder\r\nwere necessary if greater powers were to be developed, and that our\r\nshort-barrelled muzzle-loaders were already becoming obsolete. In the\r\nsummer of ’79 public interest was aroused by the arrival at Spithead of\r\nsome Chinese gunboats built by the firm of Armstrong. These gunboats\r\neach carried two 12-ton breech-loading guns mounted on centre pivots,\r\none forward and one aft: guns so powerful and efficient compared with\r\nany mounted in the Royal Navy, that the possibilities of the diminutive\r\ncraft were instantly appreciated. The contest between B.L. and M.L.\r\nwas approaching a climax. The 100-ton M.L. gun was undergoing proof at\r\nWoolwich. In August a committee of naval officers visited Germany to\r\nwitness and report upon the trials of Krupp’s new breech-loaders, and\r\nthese trials, and those of Armstrong in this country, confirmed the\r\nformidable character of the new ordnance. Armour was also improving\r\nits power; compound armour (of combined steel and iron) was found to\r\npossess unexpected powers of resistance to penetration.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo, moreover, in its growing efficiency was now beginning\r\nto have an effect, not only on the details of ship design, but on\r\nthe whole nature of naval warfare. The influence of the torpedo in\r\nits various forms had been appreciated in the early days of the\r\ndecade.[171] The catastrophic but, happily, fictitious Battle of\r\nDorking, fought in the pages of _Blackwood’s Magazine_ in 1871, had\r\nbeen preceded by a naval action in which all but one of our fine\r\nironclads had been sunk by torpedoes in attempting to ram the French\r\nfleet. The moral was obvious. From that time onwards the potential\r\neffect of the torpedo was seen to be very great. The ram seemed at last\r\nto have found a check. And it appeared that, in combating the ram, the\r\ntorpedo had once more given the primacy to the fast-improving gun.\r\nBroadside actions of the old type, carried on at high range and speed,\r\nwere predicted.[172]\r\n\r\nIn 1880 a new type of battleship was evolved of sufficient permanence\r\nto form the basis of whole classes of future ships.\r\n\r\nAn intimate account of the genesis of the _Collingwood_ design is given\r\nus by the biographer of Sir Cooper Key, to illustrate the manner in\r\nwhich that prescient administrator succeeded in forecasting the trend\r\nof future construction. In ’66, he says, Captain Key had put on paper a\r\nrésumé of his ideas on warship design which was clearly several years\r\nin advance of current opinion. Briefly, he had maintained that the\r\nspecifications for our first-class battleships of the future should be\r\ndrawn to cover the following features so far as possible:--moderate\r\nspeed, small length and great handiness; perfect protection for vital\r\nparts and a complete water-line belt, rather than protection for\r\npersonnel and above-water structure; a main-deck armament of broadside\r\nguns of medium calibre amidships, and of lighter calibre towards the\r\nends, in combination with an upper-deck armament of four large guns\r\nin two unarmoured barbettes, one mounted before the foremast and\r\none abaft the mizzen-mast; no sails. But for some years no approach\r\nwas made to this ideal ship of Captain Key’s; the ideas it embodied\r\nwere antagonistic to those held by the great majority of his brother\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n“In 1878 there had been laid down by the French, at Toulon, a ship\r\ncalled the _Caiman_. She was 278 feet long, and had a speed of 14½\r\nknots. She carried a single 42-cm. breech-loading rifled gun at the\r\nbow, and another at the stern, each mounted _en barbette_, and she\r\nfurther carried on each broadside, between the barbettes, two 10-cm.\r\nguns, besides machine-guns. She was heavily armoured by a water-line\r\nbelt 19½ inches thick amidships, and tapering in thickness towards bow\r\nand stern. The middle part of the ship, between the barbettes, was\r\nfurther protected by a steel deck 2·8 inches thick. Evidently, there\r\nwas in this ship some approach to that general ideal which had been\r\nin Sir Cooper Key’s mind in 1866--not, however, more than this. She\r\ngave a sort of hint to the constructors at the Admiralty, and, before\r\nSir Cooper Key joined the Board, a new design, based indeed on the\r\n_Caiman’s_ hint, but yet differing widely from her, and, by as much as\r\nshe differed, approaching more nearly to Sir Cooper Key’s ideal, was in\r\nprocess of completion there. The ship was the _Collingwood_.”\r\n\r\nThe _Collingwood_ was of 9150 tons displacement, 325 feet in length, 68\r\nfeet in breadth, and 15·7 knots speed. There was in her, for the first\r\ntime in the navy, that particular disposition of guns which Captain Key\r\nhad recommended in ’66: two guns at bow, two at stern, on turntables,\r\nand a strong broadside armament between them. In the end the adoption\r\nof a breech-loading system led to a larger barbette and a smaller\r\nbattery armament: to 43-ton guns at bow and stern and only 6-inch guns\r\non the broadsides; and in this way the final design differed more than\r\ndid the original from the ’66 ideal. “The bow and stern guns were\r\nprotected by barbette and other armour, but Key had required that\r\nsome protection should be given to the turntables and the machinery\r\nfor working them. Hydraulics had greatly increased the quantity and\r\nimportance of this machinery, and as by its means the crews of the\r\nguns were very much diminished, we can imagine the admiral concurring\r\nin the change as a natural development of his principle. So we can\r\nunderstand him as now definitely concurring in the abandonment of sail\r\npower for first-class battleships.” In ’78 he had flown his flag in the\r\n_Thunderer_ at sea, and he had then experienced the reliability of the\r\ngun machinery and the difficulties attendant on the manœuvring of a\r\nmodern fleet under sail.\r\n\r\nBoth in armament and in disposition of armour the _Collingwood_ was a\r\ngreat but a natural advance on the citadel ships of the _Inflexible_\r\ntype. The symmetrical placing of the big gun turntables, one forward\r\nand one aft, proclaimed the advent of new tactical ideas--the\r\nrecognition of the battleship as a unit which must take its place in\r\nthe line with others, and the rejection of “end-on” methods of fighting\r\nwhich involved a concentration of bow-fire. The provision of the\r\npowerful secondary armament was a tribute to the growing efficiency\r\nof French torpedo craft, while at the same time serving, offensively,\r\nto force an enemy to protect himself against it: to spread his armour\r\nover as large a surface as possible in the attempt to preserve his\r\nstability in a protracted action. The concentration of armour on the\r\nfixed barbettes and on a partial belt over the central portion of the\r\nship was in accordance with the _Inflexible_ arrangement. But, in\r\nconsequence of the strictures which had been passed on that vessel\r\nand on the exposure of her large unprotected ends, the _Collingwood_\r\nwas given a longer belt, though not so thick. Fifty-four per cent of\r\nher length was covered with 18-inch compound armour, as compared with\r\n42 per cent, and 24-inch armour, in the former ship. Although this\r\nlonger belt appeared to confer greater longitudinal stability on the\r\nship, its narrowness was such that it was of doubtful efficacy, as Sir\r\nEdward Reed was not slow to point out. So narrow was this belt, so big\r\nstill remained the unarmoured ends, that the slight sinkage caused by\r\ntheir filling would bring the whole of the armour belt, he said, under\r\nwater. Thus all the advantage arising from a longer citadel was more\r\nthan destroyed by this lowering of the armour, and, so great was the\r\nconsequent danger of the vessel capsizing, that he hesitated to regard\r\nthe _Collingwood_ as an armoured ship.\r\n\r\nThe _Collingwood_ was laid down in July, 1880. But what was there to\r\nshow that her design would be in any degree permanent? Was it safe to\r\nconsider it sufficiently satisfactory to form the master-pattern for a\r\nnumber of new ships, urgently required?\r\n\r\nFor a short time there was uncertainty. “The French type, where there\r\nwere isolated armoured barbette towers generally containing single\r\nheavy guns placed at the ends and sides of the ships upon the upper\r\ndeck, with broadside batteries of lighter guns, entirely unprotected\r\nby armour, upon the deck below, did not commend itself to the English\r\nnaval mind, yet, in the sort of despair which possessed us, the new\r\nBoard turned somewhat towards the French system. The _Warspite_ and\r\n_Impérieuse_ were laid down in 1881, and were again a new departure in\r\nBritish design.... It was intended to adhere to sail power in these\r\nnew types, and it was only after they were approaching completion that\r\nthe utter incongruity of the proposal was realized, and sail power was\r\ngiven up in the last of the armoured ships to which it was attempted to\r\napply it.”\r\n\r\nBut the Admiralty still wished, without alarming the public, to regain\r\nas soon as possible a safe balance of armoured construction over that\r\nof France. “There was no design before the Board which was more likely\r\nto perpetuate itself than that of the unlaunched _Collingwood_. Suppose\r\na bold policy were adopted? Suppose it were assumed that the time had\r\ncome when diversities of type were to cease, would it be made less\r\nlikely by the frank abandonment of sail power?”\r\n\r\nThe bold step was taken. Four more ships to the _Collingwood_ design\r\nwere laid down in ’82, the five being thereafter spoken of as the\r\n“Admiral” class. “At the time, little note was taken of this very\r\ngreat step in advance. Even at this day it is scarcely remembered\r\nthat this is the step which made possible, and led up to, our\r\npresent great battle fleet, and that never before had so many as\r\nfive first-class ironclads of a definite type been on the stocks\r\ntogether.... In the Admiral class there was the definite parting with\r\nsail power, the rejection of the tactical ideas brought to a climax\r\nin the _Inflexible_, and, above all, the definite adoption of the\r\nlong-barrelled breech-loading rifled gun. Without question, we must say\r\nthat we owe the Admiral class, and all that has followed, in great part\r\nto the enterprising and yet well-balanced mind that then governed the\r\nnaval part of the Council at Whitehall.”\r\n\r\n\r\n§\r\n\r\nAt this point in the evolution of the ironclad it is convenient to\r\nbring our survey to an end. The _Collingwood_ marks the final return\r\n(with one or two notorious exceptions) to the truly broadside ship,\r\nthe ship with armament symmetrically disposed fore and aft, intended\r\nto fight with others in the line. From the Admiral class onwards the\r\nmodern battleship evolved for years along a continuous and clearly\r\ndefined curve of progression. It only remains to close this brief and\r\nnecessarily superficial historical sketch with a few remarks upon the\r\nclassification of warships.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the types of ironclads which superseded each other in direct\r\nsuccession, no mention has been made of other than those which formed\r\nin their time the chief units of naval force. Other war-vessels there\r\nwere, of course, subsidiary to the main fighting force, whose value and\r\nfunctions we now briefly indicate.\r\n\r\nSo long as sails remained the sole motive power, warships retained the\r\nsame classification as they had received in the seventeenth century.\r\n“Up to the time of the Dutch Wars,” says Admiral Colomb, “ships were\r\nboth ‘royal’ and of private contribution; of all sorts and sizes\r\nand ‘rates.’ Fighting was therefore promiscuous. Fleets sailed in\r\nthe form of half-moons, or all heaped together and, except for the\r\nstruggle to get the weather gage, there were no tactics. Actions were\r\ngeneral.” Then, in order to protect their fleets from the fire ship,\r\nthe Dutch first introduced the Line of Battle: “in which formation\r\nit was easy for a fleet to leeward to open out so as to let a fire\r\nship drift harmlessly through.” And so the efficacy of the fire ship\r\nwas destroyed. “But now, with a Line, each ship had a definite place\r\nwhich she could not quit. Hence the diversities in sizes began to be\r\neliminated. The weakest ships, which might find themselves opposite\r\nthe strongest, were dropped for ships ‘fit to lie in the line,’ i.e.\r\nfor what were afterwards called ‘line-of-battle ships.’ These ships\r\nwould be individually as powerful as possible, only subject to the\r\nobjection of putting too many eggs in one basket. Uniformity would thus\r\nbe attained. The fleet of line ships, however, required look-outs or\r\nscouts, which could keep the seas and attend, yet out-sail, the fleet.\r\nHence the heavy frigate. Lastly, there was the much lighter attendant\r\non commerce (either by way of attack or defence), the light cruiser.”\r\n\r\nAlthough this differentiation of types was based ostensibly upon\r\ndisplacement or tonnage, in reality it was formed on a more scientific\r\nbasis. Admiral Sir George Elliot demonstrated, in 1867, that the real\r\nbasis was not a rule of size, but a _law of safety_, similar to that\r\nwhich operates in the natural world; a law so important that it should\r\nunder no circumstances be disregarded. He showed that sailing ships\r\nconformed to this law. He showed that the reduction of a vessel’s\r\nsize, for instance, endowed her with smaller draught and an increased\r\nspeed; that the dispensing with one quality automatically gave another\r\nin compensation; and that thus the weakly armed vessel always possessed\r\nthe means, if not to fight, to escape from capture.[173]\r\n\r\nWith the coming of steam and armour, all this was changed. Size had\r\nnow no inherent disability; on the contrary, the larger the ship the\r\ngreater the horse-power which could be carried in her, the greater her\r\nprobable speed and sea endurance. The small ship had no advantages.\r\nThe old classification had clearly broken down. The first ironclads,\r\nthe _Warrior_ and her successors, although of frigate form, belonged\r\nto no particular class; they were of a special type intended to cope\r\nwith the most powerful ships afloat or projected; and subsequent ships\r\nwere designed with the same end in view. These ships being faster as\r\nwell as more powerful than those of a smaller size, there was no object\r\nin attempting to build others of a frigate class for the purpose of\r\noutsailing them.\r\n\r\nAs material developed, and as the warship became more and more\r\nobviously a compromise between conflicting qualities, differentiation\r\nof types was once more seen to be necessary. Attempts were made to\r\nclassify on the bases of displacement, material, defensive and motive\r\npower, service, system of armament. In the end British construction\r\ndivided itself into two categories: armoured and unarmoured vessels.\r\nAnd each of these categories was subdivided into classes of ships\r\nanalogous to those of the old sailing ships.\r\n\r\nBut, during the transitional period 1860 to 1880, when armour and\r\niron ships, steam engines, rifled guns, and fish torpedoes, were all\r\nin their infancy and subject to the most rapid development, no such\r\nclassification was recognized. The circumstances of the Crimean War,\r\nwith the adoption of armour and the sudden and enormous growth in the\r\nunit of artillery force which took place soon afterwards, led to the\r\nfirst differentiation of ironclads, into ocean-going and coast-defence\r\nvessels. We have already noted this fact. We have seen how, especially\r\nto the lesser Powers, the turreted monitor appeared to offer an\r\neconomical and effective form of naval force; and we have noted how, in\r\nAmerica, the evolution proceeded in the opposite direction, viz. from\r\ncoast-defence monitor to ocean-going turret ship. This differentiation\r\nprevailed for many years. It prevailed even in the British navy, in\r\nspite of its being in full opposition to the offensive principle on\r\nwhich that navy had always based its policy.\r\n\r\nLater, although convinced that in any war involving this country and\r\nits colonies the chief combats must be fought in European waters, naval\r\nopinion saw the necessity for a type of ship designed primarily for the\r\ndefence and attack of commerce: a speedy, lightly armed and protected\r\ntype capable of overhauling and injuring a weaker, or of escaping from\r\na more powerful enemy. The American War of ’62, in which no general sea\r\naction was fought, gave the impulse to the construction of the type\r\nwhich eventually became known as the _cruiser_. Vessels were built in\r\n’63 expressly to overtake Confederate vessels and drive from the seas\r\nthe Southern mercantile marine. These vessels were to annihilate the\r\nenemy’s commerce without being drawn themselves to take part in an\r\nengagement, unless in very favourable circumstances. Several such ships\r\nwere built. The first, the _Idaho_, was a complete failure; the next\r\nattempt was little more successful; and those subsequently constructed,\r\nthe _Wampanoag_ class, the finest ships of the type which existed at\r\nthe close of the war, which were designed for 17 knots and to carry\r\nsixteen 10- or 11-inch smooth-bore cast-iron guns on the broadside and\r\na revolving 60-pounder rifle in the bows, suffered from miscalculations\r\nin design and from the weakness peculiar to long and heavily weighted\r\ntimber-built ships. “These pioneers of the type,” says Brassey, “were\r\nfollowed, both in England and in France, by vessels believed by the\r\nbuilders of their respective countries to be better adapted for the\r\nwork for which they were designed.”\r\n\r\nAt first England and France had built and appropriated small ironclads\r\nto this secondary service; in France the _Belliqueuse_, in England\r\nthe _Pallas_, were designed to this end. But in ’66 the first ship of\r\nthe cruiser type was built for the British navy: the _Inconstant_,\r\nof Sir Edward Reed’s design, an iron-built, fine-lined vessel with a\r\nspeed of 16 knots and a large coal capacity. She was followed by the\r\ncorvettes _Active_ and _Volage_, and then, in ’73, by the _Shah_ and\r\n_Raleigh_. Experience with the early cruisers showed the advantages\r\nof large displacement. “The greater number of the American corvettes\r\nhad now been launched. A trial of one of them showed that the high\r\nhopes which had been entertained of their performance were fallacious.\r\nIt now appeared no longer necessary that the English corvettes\r\nshould possess such extraordinary power and speed, qualities which\r\nnecessarily required very large displacements. The Admiralty, however,\r\nstill believing in the wisdom of the policy which they had previously\r\nadopted, decided to follow a totally different course from that which\r\nall other navies had been compelled by financial considerations to\r\nfollow. So far from diminishing the size of their ships, increased\r\ndisplacement was given to the new designs.”[174] Full sail power was\r\nstill required, for the high-power steam engine used by the cruiser for\r\nfighting purposes was most uneconomical. The _Raleigh_, for instance,\r\nburned her six hundred tons of coal in less than 36 hours, at full\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nBut after the _Raleigh_ came a slight reaction. With a view to economy\r\na smaller type of vessel was designed, the smallest possible vessel\r\nwhich could be contrived which would possess a covered-in gun deck\r\nin combination with other features considered essential in a frigate\r\nclass; the result was the _Boadicea_ or the _Bacchante_ class. In the\r\nlate ’seventies size again increased, and the _Iris_ and _Mercury_,\r\nunsheathed vessels of steel, with coal-protection for their water-line\r\nand extended watertight subdivision of the hull, were laid down.\r\n\r\nFrom the unarmoured, unprotected cruiser was in time evolved, by the\r\ncompetition of units, the armoured cruiser. Russia led the way. Her\r\n_General-Admiral_, the first belted cruiser, was built to compete with\r\nthe _Raleigh_ and _Boadicea_. Then England designed the _Shannon_,\r\npartially belted and with protective deck and coal protection, to\r\noutmatch her. Eventually the cleavage came, and the cruisers were\r\nthemselves divided into two or more classes, in accordance with their\r\nduties, size and fitness for the line of battle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the development of torpedo craft this is not the place to write;\r\nalthough the torpedo was fast growing in efficiency and importance, it\r\nhad not, before 1880, become the centre and cause of a special craft\r\nand a special system for its employment in action. But after that\r\ndate the creation of torpedo flotillas began to exercise a marked and\r\ncontinuous effect upon the evolution of the ironclad. The fish-torpedo,\r\nimproving at a phenomenal rate in the first years of its development,\r\nand at first esteemed as of defensive value and as a counter to the\r\nram, became, after 1880, an offensive weapon of the first importance.\r\nThe ram, already suspected of being placed too high in popular\r\nestimation, suffered a decline; the danger of its use in action was\r\nemphasized by naval officers, whose opinion alone was decisive: its\r\nuse, as an eminent tactician explained, reduced the chances of battle\r\nto a mere toss-up, since there was “only half a ship’s length between\r\nramming and being rammed.” The gun developed in power, in range, and\r\naccuracy; but not (up to the end of the century) at so great a rate\r\nas its rival, the torpedo. The steam engine affected all weapons\r\nby its continuous development. It depressed the ram, enhanced the\r\nimportance of the gun, and endowed the torpedo with a large accession\r\nof potential value in placing it, in its special fast sea-going craft,\r\nwithin reach of the battleship; moreover, it enabled the cruiser to\r\nregain its old supremacy of speed over the line-of-battle unit. Armour,\r\nquick-firing guns, secondary armament, watertight construction, net\r\ndefence, all influenced the development of the various types. But it\r\nwas the torpedo, borne into action by the high-speed steam engine,\r\nwhich had the greatest effect on naval types in the last two decades of\r\nthe century, and which at one time bid fair to cause a constructional\r\nrevolution as great as that of 1860. The torpedo, according to a\r\nschool of French enthusiasts, had destroyed the ironclad battleship\r\nand dealt a heavy blow at English sea power by paving the way for an\r\ninexpensive navy designed for a _guerre de course_. The ironclad was\r\ndead, they cried, and might as well be placed in the Louvre museum\r\nalong with the old three-deckers! In Italy and Germany, too, the\r\nlogic of facts seemed to point to a vast depreciation in the power of\r\nexisting navies: the fate of the expensive ironclad seemed assured, in\r\nthe presence of small, fast, sea going torpedo-boats. Still, it was\r\nnoticed, England laid down battleships. True; this was quite in keeping\r\nwith her machiavellian policy. Had she not resisted--“not blindly, but\r\nwith a profound clairvoyance”--all the inventions of the century? Had\r\nshe not successfully baulked the development of Fulton’s mines, steam\r\nnavigation, the shell gun, and the ironclad itself? And, now that steam\r\nhad made the blockade impossible and the torpedo had attacked the\r\nironclad effectually, making sea-supremacy an empty term, could not\r\nthe British Empire be destroyed by taking the choice of weapons out of\r\nEngland’s hands?\r\n\r\nThe prospect was alluring. Yet the ironclad survived the menace\r\nand remained the standard unit of naval power. Expensive, designed\r\nwith several aims and essentially complex,--a compromise, like man\r\nhimself,--it could not be replaced by a number of small, cheap,\r\nuni-functional vessels, each constructed for one sole and special\r\npurpose, without loss of efficiency and concentration of power.\r\nNor could it be supplanted by a type which, like the sea-going\r\ntorpedo-boat, could only count on an ascendancy over it in certain\r\nmoments of its own choosing--for example, at night-time or in a fog. To\r\nevery novel species of attack the ironclad proved superior, calling to\r\nits aid the appropriate defensive measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Sir Harry Nicolas: _History of the Royal Navy_.\r\n\r\n[2] The greatest authoritative works on ancient and medieval shipping,\r\nit should be mentioned, are the _Archéologie Navale_ and the _Glossaire\r\nNautique_ of M.

By the end of the\r\ncentury the manufacture had evidently improved in this country. “Some\r\ndo make excellent good corn powder, so fine, that the corns thereof are\r\nlike thime seed,” wrote Thos. Smith in his _Art of Gunnery_, A.D. 1600.\r\n\r\n[52] Oppenheim.\r\n\r\n[53] Bourne: _The Art of Shooting in Great Ordnance_, 1587.\r\n\r\n[54] Sir J. K. Laughton: _Armada Papers, N.R.S._\r\n\r\n[55] Smith demolished, to his own satisfaction, a theory current\r\nthat some molecular movement of the metal took place at the moment\r\nof gunfire. “I asked the opinion of a soldier, who for a trespass\r\ncommitted was enjoined to ride the canon, who confidently affirmed, he\r\ncould perceive no quivering of the metal of the piece, but that the air\r\nwhich issued out of the mouth and touch-hole of the piece did somewhat\r\nastonish and shake him.”\r\n\r\n[56] The advantages of large calibres had been appreciated in the\r\nprevious century. Sir Richard Hawkins, in his _Observations_, printed\r\nin 1593, compares the armament of his own ships with that of his\r\nSpanish opponents, and says: “Although their artillery were larger,\r\nweightier, and many more than ours, and in truth did pierce with\r\ngreater violence; yet ours being of greater bore, and carrying a\r\nweightier and greater shot, was of more importance and of better effect\r\nfor sinking and spoiling.”\r\n\r\n[57] Oppenheim.\r\n\r\n[58] A significant view of the attitude of these professionals toward\r\nany innovation in gunnery material is afforded by the entry of Mr.\r\nPepys in his diary for the 17th April, 1669.\r\n\r\n[59] An anonymous writer in the _Pall Mall Gazette_.\r\n\r\n[60] Le Sieur Malthus, gentil-homme Anglois, Commissaire Général des\r\nFeux et Artifices de l’Artillerie de France, Capitaine General des\r\nSappes et Mines d’icelle & Ingeniéur és Armées du Roy, published his\r\n_Pratique de la Guerre_ in 1668. This notable but almost-forgotten\r\nartillerist introduced the use of mortars and bombs into France, in\r\n1637. He was killed by a musket ball at the siege of Gravelines, as he\r\nelevated himself above the rampart of a trench in order to watch the\r\neffect of a bomb (St. Remy: _Mémoires_).\r\n\r\n[61] This account is taken from _Historical Notes on Woolwich_, Lieut.\r\nGrover, R.E. (Proc. R.A.I., Vol. VI).\r\n\r\n[62] Le Blond: _Traité de l’Artillerie_, 1743.\r\n\r\n[63] Lieut.-Gen. Sir William Congreve, Bart., was, as Captain Congreve,\r\nappointed in 1783 to the control of the Royal Laboratory at Woolwich.\r\nSent in ’79 to Plymouth, to examine the gunpowders of H.M. ships in\r\nconsequence of the complaints of Admiral Barington, he found only\r\nfour serviceable barrels in the whole fleet. The gross frauds then\r\nbrought to light led to the formation of the Government establishment\r\nat Waltham Abbey. His son was the inventor of the Congreve sight and\r\nrocket.\r\n\r\n[64] Gen. Sir Thomas Blomefield, Bart., who started his service\r\ncareer as a midshipman, commanded a bomb vessel under Rodney at the\r\nbombardment of Havre in 1759, and was present at Quiberon. After varied\r\nservice abroad he was appointed, in 1780, Inspector of Artillery and\r\nof the Brass Foundry. “Never was the need of military supervision\r\nover military manufactures more apparent than at this period. The\r\nguns supplied to the naval and military forces had degenerated to the\r\nlowest point in quality. Bursts were of frequent occurrence, and would\r\ndoubtless have been much more frequent if the roguery of contractors in\r\ngunpowder had not kept pace with the roguery of contractors in guns....\r\nFrom this period dates the high character of British cast iron and\r\nbrass ordnance.”\r\n\r\n[65] Favé.\r\n\r\n[66] The author of the _Études sur l’Artillerie_ places emphasis on\r\nthe importance of the substitution of cast iron for stone projectiles,\r\nas augmenting the power of artillery. Stone balls broke to pieces on\r\nimpact with masonry, and were of small destructive power except when\r\nin large mass, as projected from the largest bombards. He claims the\r\nintroduction of iron shot, the use of trunnions for elevating, and the\r\nstandardization of calibres, for the French artillery of Charles VIII,\r\nwho in 1495 descended on Italy.\r\n\r\n[67] Favé.\r\n\r\n[68] Lieut.-Col.

The Marquis was being conducted through the prison of the\r\nBicêtre in Paris when his attention was attracted by the screams of\r\nan old madman who had made a wonderful discovery of the power of\r\nsteam, and who had so importuned Cardinal Richelieu that he had been\r\nincarcerated as a nuisance.\r\n\r\n“This person,” said the insolvent Lord Worcester after conversing with\r\nhim, “is no madman; and in my country, instead of shutting him up, they\r\nwould heap riches upon him. In this prison you have buried the greatest\r\ngenius of your age.”\r\n\r\nThe fable, and its exposure by a French writer, M.

The\r\niconoclast has not been successful. The evidence that the first engines\r\nwere hand-controlled is very general (see Galloway’s _Steam Engine and\r\nIts Inventors_).\r\n\r\n[78] At this time the corpuscular theory of heat still held the field.\r\n“Caloric,” or the matter of heat, was supposed to be a substance which\r\ncould be imparted to or abstracted from a body, which had the property\r\nof augmenting its bulk, but not its weight, by setting its particles at\r\na greater or less distance from one another.\r\n\r\n[79] _Encycl. Brit._, Eleventh Edition.\r\n\r\n[80] A text-book published a few years before Robins’ birth (Binnings’\r\n_Light to the Art of Gunnery_, 1689) told how a certain profane and\r\ngodless gunner, Cornelius Slime, was carried off by the devil before\r\nthe eyes of the astonished onlookers!\r\n\r\n[81] Whewell: _Hist. of the Inductive Sciences_.\r\n\r\n[82] Dr. Halley: _Phil. Trans._, 1686.\r\n\r\n[83] How strange and almost incredible this phenomenon appeared to\r\npeople long after Robins’ time, may be seen from the manner in which\r\nEzekiel Baker, one of the principal London gunmakers and the contractor\r\nwho supplied the rifles with which the Rifle Brigade was equipped in\r\nthe year 1800, poured gentle sarcasm on the account of this experiment.\r\nIn his book on _Rifle Guns_, published in 1825, he can only assign the\r\ncause of the deflection to “some peculiar enchantment in the air.”\r\n“Or,” he continues, “with all my practice I have yet much to learn in\r\nguns, and the effects of powder and wind upon the ball in its flight.”\r\n\r\n[84] Of the superstitious awe with which an iron field-piece was\r\nregarded by the highlanders in ’45, and of its small material value in\r\nthe field, a note will be found in the appendices to Scott’s _Waverley_.\r\n\r\n[85] Mr. Patrick Miller, who is mentioned in a later chapter as\r\nbuilder of the first successful steam-propelled vessel, was also an\r\nenthusiastic artillerist. In a memorandum to the Select Committee of\r\nthe House of Commons, appointed in 1824 to consider the claims of\r\nvarious inventors of steam-vessels, a Mr. Taylor gave the following\r\nevidence: “I found him (Mr. Miller) a gentleman of great patriotism,\r\ngenerosity, and philanthropy; and at the same time of a very\r\nspeculative turn of mind. Before I knew him (1785) he had gone through\r\na very long and expensive course of experiments upon artillery of which\r\nthe carronade was the result.”\r\n\r\n[86] On April 20th, 1669, Mr. Pepys recorded in his diary a\r\nvisit to “the Old Artillery-ground near the Spitalfields” to see\r\na new gun “which, from the shortness and bigness, they do call\r\nPunchinello.” Tried against a gun of double its own length, weight,\r\nand powder-charge, Punchinello shot truer to a mark and was easier\r\nto manage and had no greater recoil--to the great regret of the old\r\ngunners and officers of the ordnance that were there.\r\n\r\nThe gallant inventor offered Mr. Pepys a share in the profits; there\r\nseemed great promise that the king would favour it for naval use.\r\n“And,” adds Pepys, “no doubt but it will be of profit to merchantmen\r\nand others to have guns of the same form at half the charge.”\r\n\r\n[87] James: _Naval History_.\r\n\r\n[88] The carrying of _sham_ guns among their armament was not unknown\r\nin the case of vessels which boasted a reputation for their superior\r\nspeed and sailing qualities (vide _Bentham Papers_).\r\n\r\n[89] Captain Simmons, R.A.\r\n\r\n[90] The carriage thus formed out of a baulk or trunk appears to have\r\nbeen known as a trunk carriage. Norton describes the cannon-periers as\r\nbeing mounted on “trunk carriages provided with four trucks.”\r\n\r\n[91] Oppenheim.\r\n\r\n[92] It was evidently a practice at this period to vary the diameter\r\nof the trucks to suit the ship’s structure and the height of the\r\ngun-ports. “Be careful,” says Bourne in 1587, “that the trucks be not\r\ntoo high, for if the trucks be too high, then it will keep the carriage\r\nthat it will not go close against the ship’s side.... And the truck\r\nbeing very high, it is not a small thing under a truck that will stay\r\nit, etc. etc. And also, if that the truck be too high, it will cause\r\nthe piece to have the greater reverse or recoil. Therefore, the lower\r\nthat the trucks be, it is the better.”\r\n\r\nBourne also mentions, in the same book, the _Art of Shooting in Great\r\nOrdnance_, as a curious invention of a “high Dutchman” a gun mounting\r\nso devised as to allow the piece to rotate through 180° about its\r\ntrunnions for loading.\r\n\r\n[93] Manwayring: _Sea-Man’s Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n[94] Oppenheim.\r\n\r\n[95] Hutchinson: _Naval Architecture_.\r\n\r\n[96] In the margin of the copy of _The Art of Gunnery_, Thos. Smith,\r\nA.D. 1600, in the library of the R.U.S.I. in Whitehall, is the\r\nfollowing note, written in legible seventeenth-century script: “Some\r\nmake a device to discharge at a distance by a long string, fixed to a\r\ndevice like a cock for a gun with a flint or like a musket cock with a\r\nmatch.”\r\n\r\nIn the same work are instructions as to firing in a wind, when the\r\ntrain of powder might be blown from the vent before the linstock could\r\nbe applied. The gunner was to form a clay rampart, a sort of tinker’s\r\ndam, on the metal of the piece on the windward side of the touch-hole.\r\n\r\n[97] On this Sir John Laughton remarked: “The exercise, so born,\r\ncontinued as long as the old men-of-war and the old guns--‘Ships\r\npassing on opposite tacks; three rounds of quick firing’” (_Barham\r\nPapers_, N.R. Soc.).\r\n\r\n[98] A form of sight for use with ordnance was described by Nathaniel\r\nNye, in his _Art of Gunnery_, of 1674. It consisted of a lute-string\r\nand a movable bead, with a scale opposite the latter graduated in\r\ndegrees and inches.\r\n\r\n[99] In Lloyd and Hadcock’s _Artillery_ an extract from a letter\r\nwritten in 1801 by Lord Nelson relative to a proposal to use gun-sights\r\nat sea is given. The letter is unfavourable to the invention on the\r\nground that, as ships should always be at such close quarters with\r\ntheir enemies that missing becomes impossible, such appliances would be\r\nsuperfluous. But in this connection the observation is made that, with\r\nthe degree of accuracy of guns up to the nineteenth century a rough\r\n“line of metal” aim was probably all that was justified, in the matter\r\nof sighting. In other words, with one element of the system (the gun)\r\nso very inaccurate, nothing was to be gained by increasing the accuracy\r\nof another element (the sight) to a disproportionate degree. With\r\nincreasing accuracy of the gun, increasing accuracy of sight was called\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n[100] In Vol. IV of the _Proceedings of the Royal Artillery\r\nInstitution_, in an article by General Lefroy, an order is quoted\r\nshowing that trials were made of firing shells horizontally by the\r\nRoyal Artillery in Canada in 1776. The author also shows that the\r\ntrials made by the French in 1784-6 were brought to the notice of Lord\r\nNelson.\r\n\r\nIn Vol. V is the following extract: “Experiments were made on\r\nActon Common in 1760, to fire coehorn and royal shells from 12-and\r\n24-pounders, in order to be applied to the sea service; but as the\r\nshells were found frequently to burst in the guns, it was thought too\r\nhazardous to introduce them on board ships of war.”\r\n\r\n[101] The first public demonstration was given by Lieut. Shrapnel,\r\nR.A., before the G.O.C., Gibraltar, in the year 1787.\r\n\r\n[102] Simmons: _Effect of Heavy Ordnance_, 1837.\r\n\r\n[103] James: _Naval History_.\r\n\r\n[104] A short review of both books is given in the _Papers on Naval\r\nArchitecture_, edited by Morgan and Creuze, 1829.\r\n\r\n[105] See Hugo’s _Toilers of the Sea_.\r\n\r\n[106] “As for guns,” wrote Fuller in his _Worthies of England_,\r\ncomparing the relative merits of the inventions of printing and\r\ngunpowder, “it cannot be denied, that though most behold them as\r\ninstruments of cruelty; partly, because subjecting valour to chance;\r\npartly, because guns give no quarter (which the sword sometimes doth);\r\nyet it will appear that, since their invention, Victory hath not stood\r\nso long a neuter, and hath been determined with the loss of fewer\r\nlives.”\r\n\r\n[107] At a later date this reduction in number of types of ordnance was\r\nextended to cover land artillery. In ’62 the French brought down the\r\nnumber of different calibres to four: one for the field, one for the\r\nsiege, and two (the 30-and 50-pounders) for the navy.\r\n\r\n[108] Dahlgren: _Shells and Shell-Guns_, 1856.\r\n\r\n[109] By this time Denmark, Holland, Russia and Sweden had all\r\nrecognized the possibilities of shell guns, and had adopted them in\r\ngreater or less degree. By this time, too, France actually possessed\r\nmore steam war-vessels than we had ourselves.\r\n\r\n[110] Simmons: _Effects of Heavy Ordnance_.\r\n\r\n[111] The crossbow was looked upon as a weapon unworthy of a brave\r\nman; a prejudice which afterwards prevailed with respect to fire-arms\r\n(Hallam: _Middle Ages_).\r\n\r\n[112] The Hon.

Fremantle: _The Book of the Rifle_.\r\n\r\n[113] _Le Développement des Armes à Feu_, 1870.\r\n\r\n[114] In this aspect of the origin of the grooves there is a curious\r\nanalogy between the rifle-barrel and the drill used in machine tools.\r\nIn the primitive drill the shank is appreciably less in diameter than\r\nthe hole cut by the drill, so that the drillings can easily work their\r\nway out of the hole. When, however, it was desired to make the shank\r\nalmost of the same diameter as the hole, so as to form a guide, it was\r\nnecessary to flute it with two grooves or more to allow the drillings\r\nto get away. In the course of its evolution these grooves became spiral.\r\n\r\n[115] Quoted in _The Book of the Rifle_ from Schmidt’s _Armes à Feu\r\nPortatives_, 1889.\r\n\r\n[116] Delvigne: _Notice historique des armes rayées_.\r\n\r\n[117] Beaufoy: _Scloppetaria_.\r\n\r\n[118] A paragraph in Beaufoy’s _Scloppetaria_ (1808) shows the complete\r\nmisconception under which its author laboured as to the function of\r\nrifling. Just as the air turns a windmill or a shuttlecock (he says),\r\nso, after an indented ball quits its rifled barrel the air, forced\r\nspirally along its grooves, will cause the ball to turn. In short, he\r\nregarded the spiral grooves of a barrel as being of no further utility,\r\nwith respect to the generating of the rotary motion, than as an easy\r\nway of giving the ball the requisite indentations.\r\n\r\n[119] Fremantle: _The Book of the Rifle_.\r\n\r\n[120] Captain A. Walker: _The Rifle_, 1864.\r\n\r\n[121] At the beginning of the century Ezekiel Baker had noted that “a\r\nwadding in the shape of an acorn cup placed on the powder, and the ball\r\nput on the top of the cup, will expand the cup and fill the bore--and\r\nof course the windage will be much diminished.”\r\n\r\n[122] Mention must be made of an important prior development of the\r\nelongated bullet which had been carried out by General Jacob in India,\r\nquite independently of French research. General Jacob conducted, in an\r\naltogether scientific manner, experiments the successful results of\r\nwhich were communicated by him to the home government on more than one\r\noccasion. The importance of his discoveries remained unrecognized, and\r\nthe value of his improvements was lost to this country.\r\n\r\n[123] In military circles the possibilities of the invasion of this\r\ncountry had for some time been under discussion, in view of the\r\nincreasingly aggressive temper of the French. Interest in national\r\ndefence became general with the warning letter of the Duke of\r\nWellington which appeared in _The Times_ on the 9th January, 1847. In\r\n’51 was held the Great Exhibition, and for a time opinion was less\r\nagitated. The Exhibition, it was thought and hoped by numbers of\r\npeople, would inaugurate the millennium.\r\n\r\n[124] This advantage of the rifled gun hod been fully appreciated\r\nby Captain Norton. As early as 1832 he had conducted trials with\r\none-pounder rifled cannon, to confirm his belief that the projectile\r\nwould maintain its rotation during flight and hit the target\r\npoint-first (_Journal of R.U.S.I._, 1837).\r\n\r\n[125] Commander R. A. E.

This book gives in detail the\r\ncontroversy which arose between the advocates of the Armstrong and the\r\nWhitworth systems.\r\n\r\n[127] _Edinburgh Review_, 1859. Quoted by Sir E. Tennant.\r\n\r\n[128] The sudden and extraordinary development of rifled ordnance\r\nwhich now took place had a revolutionary effect not only on naval\r\narchitecture and gunnery but on land fortification. In ’59 Sir William\r\nArmstrong, giving evidence before a committee appointed by the War\r\nSecretary, stated that he could attain with a specially constructed\r\ngun a range of five miles. The statement made a sensation; for in the\r\npresence of such a gun most of the existing defences of our dockyards\r\nand depots were almost useless. A Commission on National Defence\r\nwas formed. It reported that new fortifications were necessary for\r\nour principal arsenals, the fleet alone being insufficient for the\r\ndefence of ports. “The introduction of steam,” stated the report, “may\r\noperate to our disadvantage in diminishing to some extent the value of\r\nsuperior seamanship; the practice of firing shells horizontally, and\r\nthe enormous extent to which the power and accuracy of aim of artillery\r\nhave been increased, lead to the conclusion that after an action even\r\na victorious fleet would be more seriously crippled and therefore a\r\nlonger time unfit for service.” Thus the command of the Channel might\r\nbe temporarily lost. As steam facilitated invasion, the immediate\r\nfortification of vital points on the South Coast was considered\r\nnecessary. In short, faith in the mobile fleet was temporarily\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the Commission were carried out almost in their\r\nentirety. In the case of Portsmouth, for instance, the reinforcement of\r\nthe Hilsea Lines, decided on only two years previously, was suspended\r\nin favour of a defence of far greater radius--a circle of forts some of\r\nwhich were designed to prevent an enemy from gaining possession, from\r\nthe land side, of Portsdown Hill, a ridge less than five miles from the\r\nDockyard and therefore a position from which, with the new artillery,\r\nthe Dockyard could be bombarded. A similar girdle of defences was given\r\nto Plymouth.\r\n\r\n[129] Commander R. A. E.

A\r\ngenerous tribute has been paid him by a friend whose name is honoured\r\nin our naval annals: “I was unwearied,” says John Clerk of Eldin in\r\nthe preface of his Essay on Naval Tactics, published in 1804, “in\r\nmy attention to the many valuable experiments of the ingenious and\r\nliberal-minded Mr. Patrick Miller of Dalswinton; to whom, whether in\r\nshipbuilding or in constructing artillery, both musketry and great\r\nguns, his country is more indebted than has hitherto been properly\r\nacknowledged.”\r\n\r\n[139] Dickinson: _Robert Fulton, Engineer and Artist_.\r\n\r\n[140] Colden: _Life of Fulton_.\r\n\r\n[141] _M.

Paixhans’ argument. At that date\r\nit was still the all-but-universal opinion in foreign countries that\r\nthe introduction of steam had rendered superiority in seamanship\r\nof comparatively little importance in naval warfare. Sir Howard\r\nDouglas showed that English superiority had spread to machine design,\r\nconstruction and manipulation, and that if this country chose to exert\r\nitself it could maintain its lead.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note that not one of these three writers emphasises\r\nthe main disability under which France has actually suffered, viz. the\r\nunsuitability of French coal as warship fuel and the distance of her\r\niron and coal mines from her chief shipbuilding centres.\r\n\r\n[144] Briggs: _Naval Administrations_.\r\n\r\n[145] A steam paddle-boat, named the _Lord Melville_ in honour of the\r\ndescendant of Charlotte Dundas, was then plying regularly between\r\nLondon Bridge and Calais.\r\n\r\n[146] _Memoirs of Sir John Barrow, Bart._\r\n\r\n[147] Williams: _Life of Sir Charles Napier_.\r\n\r\n[148] In 1835 a new department, of Royal Naval Engineers, was formed:\r\nto consist of technically trained men to manage the machinery of steam\r\nvessels. A uniform button was designed for them, and they were given\r\nthe rank of Warrant Officers. Up to this time the machinery had been\r\nin charge of men who, for the most part, were “mere labourers”; and,\r\ncommanding officers being ignorant of mechanical engineering, extensive\r\nfraud and waste had been practised, especially in connection with the\r\nrefitting of vessels by contractors (Otway: _Steam Navigation_).\r\n\r\n[149] Reed: _On the Modifications to H.M. Ships in the XIXth century_.\r\n\r\n[150] The strategic value of steam power in warfare was first\r\ndemonstrated by Lord John Hay in ’30. In the operations on the North\r\nCoast of Spain “the opportune arrival of a reinforcement of fifteen\r\nhundred fresh troops from Santander, by one steamer alone, despatched\r\nthe previous day from San Sebastian, a distance of a hundred miles,\r\nfor that express purpose, gave a decisive and important turn to the\r\ntransactions of that day” (Otway: _Steam Navigation_).\r\n\r\n[151] Fincham.\r\n\r\n[152] The author of this work, M. Paucton, in addition to discussing\r\nthe possibility of replacing the oar by the screw, threw out the\r\nsuggestion of its use for aerial flight. “Je sçais qu’on ne peut guère\r\nmanquer de faire rire, en voulant donner des aîles à un homme. Je sçais\r\nque plusieurs personnes, qui out osé prendre l’effor dans les airs,\r\nn’ont pas eu un meilleur succès que l’imprudent Icare.” Nevertheless,\r\nit is incontestable that a man can lift more than his weight. And if he\r\nwere to employ his full force on a machine which could act on air as\r\ndoes the screw, it would lift him by its aid through the air as it will\r\npropel him through the water.\r\n\r\nM. Paucton hastened to calm the incredulous reader by assuring him with\r\nan affectation of levity that he was not really serious. “Il est permis\r\nde s’égayer quelquefois.”\r\n\r\n[153] A full account of these is given in Bourne’s _Treatise on the\r\nScrew Propeller_.\r\n\r\n[154] Weale: _Papers on Engineering_.\r\n\r\n[155] The _Archimedes_, with a 3-foot stroke engine which worked at\r\n27 strokes per minute, was run against the _Widgeon_, the fastest\r\npaddlewheel steamer on the Dover station. Two points of importance\r\nwere noted by the Admiralty representatives with reference to the\r\npropelling machinery of the _Archimedes_: the objectionable noise made\r\nby the spur-wheels, and their liability to damage and derangement. As,\r\nhowever, Mr. Smith proposed to obviate this objection “by substituting\r\nspiral gearing in lieu of the cogs” the representatives did not lay\r\nstress on these disadvantages.\r\n\r\n[156] A similar paradox was accidentally revealed in the case of the\r\npaddlewheel. It was at first thought that, the broader the floats the\r\ngreater would be the pull. A certain steam vessel, however, being found\r\nto have too much beam to allow her to pass into a lock, was altered by\r\nhaving her floats and paddle-boxes made narrower. It was found that her\r\nspeed had thereby been improved (Otway).\r\n\r\n[157] Note sur l’État des Forces Navales de la France, 1844.\r\n\r\n[158] Parliamentary Report on Screw Propulsion in H.M. Navy, 1850.\r\n\r\n[159] Sir Howard Douglas was instrumental in bringing to the notice\r\nof the Government the aggressive aims implied by the _Enquête\r\nParlementaire_: His notes were printed confidentially in ’53 at the\r\npress of the Foreign Office.

For instance of successful organization, Messrs. Penn\r\nof Greenwich contracted to build eighty sets of main engines in\r\nthree months--a proposition ridiculed as impossible. By the rapid\r\ndistribution of duplicate patterns throughout the country the resources\r\nof all the greatest firms were utilized, and the contract was fulfilled\r\nalmost to the day!\r\n\r\nSome seven or eight years later, when the building of ironclads was\r\nbeing debated in parliament, the government was able to recall this\r\nachievement as an argument for not building too many ships of a new and\r\nprobably transitional type. If we liked, it was said, we could soon\r\nproduce a fleet of ironclads far greater than all the other Powers of\r\nEurope besides.\r\n\r\n[163] J. Scott Russell: _The Fleet of the Future: Iron or Wood?_ 1861.\r\n\r\n[164] Reed: _Our Ironclad Ships_.\r\n\r\n[165] Boynton: _The Navies of England, France, America, and Russia._\r\nNew York, ’65.\r\n\r\n[166] Colomb: _Memoirs of Sir Cooper Key_.\r\n\r\n[167] Colomb: _Memoirs of Sir Cooper Key_.\r\n\r\n[168] In parenthesis, for she is of no special interest as a type, we\r\nmay note here the _Temeraire_, built at Chatham and completed in 1877:\r\na compromise between the central-battery and the turret ship. Generally\r\nlike the _Alexandra_ in disposition of armament, she carried in\r\naddition, in order to give all-round fire, two open barbettes, one at\r\neach end of the upper deck, each containing a 25-ton gun hydraulically\r\noperated.\r\n\r\n[169] The freedom of the _Royal Sovereign’s_ turrets from any liability\r\nto jam was demonstrated at Portsmouth by subjecting them to the impact\r\nof projectiles fired from the 12-ton guns of the _Bellerophon_.\r\n\r\n[170] Colomb: _Memoirs of Sir Cooper Key_.\r\n\r\n[171] Hitherto the torpedo had been used in warfare only in the form\r\nof a stationary mine, or motion had been given to it either by letting\r\nit drift on a tide or by attaching it rigidly to the bow of a vessel.\r\nAfter the American Civil War, in which conflict three-fourths of the\r\nships disabled or destroyed were so disposed of by torpedoes, efforts\r\nwere made to give motion to it, either by towing or by self-propulsion.\r\nIn ’69 Commander Harvey, R.N., brought to the notice of the Admiralty\r\nhis invention of a torpedo or sea kite which was so shaped that, when\r\nlaunched from the deck of a steamer and towed by a wire, it diverged\r\nfrom the steamer’s track and stood away at an angle of 45°. It could be\r\nexploded either electrically or by contact. The possibilities of this\r\nweapon were illustrated in a volume published in ’71, one picture of\r\nwhich showed luridly “an ironclad fleet surprised at sea by a squadron\r\nof torpedo craft armed with Harvey’s sea torpedoes.”\r\n\r\nThe towed torpedo was overshadowed by the fish or self-propelled\r\ntorpedo. In ’70 Mr. Whitehead came to England and, prosecuting\r\nexperiments under the eyes of naval officers, with a 16-inch torpedo\r\nsuccessfully sank an old corvette anchored in the Medway at 136 yards’\r\nrange.

predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\nArchaic spellings have not been changed; the spelling of non-English\r\nwords has not been changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\r\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.\r\n\r\nPages with Plate-illustrations included printer’s information regarding\r\nthe pages the plates should face. That information has been removed in\r\nthis eBook, as those illustrations are positioned as close as possible\r\nto those pages.\r\n\r\nThe spelling and grammar of French text has been reproduced here as it\r\nwas printed in the original book.\r\n\r\nThe publication information of a few citations was italicized, but as\r\nthat is not the style in most of the book, those words and dates are\r\nshown here unitalicized.\r\n\r\nFootnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been collected and\r\nplaced just before the Index of this eBook.\r\n\r\nIndex not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.\r\n\r\nPage 5: “tunnage” was printed that way and is in the Index, but the\r\nother pages to which the Index entry refers spell the word as “tonnage”.\r\n\r\nPage 23: “remonstance” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 47: “to their rates, And” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 72: “the King’s feedmen” was printed that way, probably should be\r\n“freedmen”.\r\n\r\nPage 265: “Give her the stem” was printed that way.",
