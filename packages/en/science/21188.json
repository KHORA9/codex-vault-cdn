I want to start soon--\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen here!\" broke in Ned Newton. \"If you're thinking of going to Mars\r\nor the moon, just count me out! I've gone with you to many strange\r\nplaces and have never kicked. But this--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, young fellow!\" interrupted the youthful inventor with an\r\namused chuckle. \"I've nothing like that in mind YET! All I want to do\r\nis show you my new 'space eye.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Newton, Tom's Chum]\r\n\r\n\"Can't say as I like that word 'yet,'\" Ned muttered darkly. \"But I'll\r\ntake a look at your new jigger if you'll promise not to shoot me through\r\nspace in a rocket or cannon-ball!\"\r\n\r\n\"Word of honor I won't,\" promised Tom, crossing his heart with mock\r\nsolemnity. \"Well, here we are.\"\r\n\r\nThe two boys had reached the laboratory, a small building at the rear\r\nof the spacious lawn surrounding Tom's father's home and close to the\r\nextensive work of the Swift Manufacturing Company at Shopton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Crossed His Heart]\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet these shelves have more scientific apparatus on 'em than any\r\nother shelves in the world,\" remarked Ned, as his chum opened the door.\r\n\r\nVarious cabinets containing hundreds of chemicals stood about. Against\r\none wall was a huge transformer, from which the youthful scientist,\r\nTom Swift, could draw almost any kind of electric current he might\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Entered the Laboratory]\r\n\r\n\"Here goes!\" said the young inventor.\r\n\r\nHe rolled back a small rug in the middle of the floor to expose a\r\nmassive steel trap door. This he unlocked by twirling the dial of a\r\ncomplicated mechanism. Some years before Tom had constructed beneath his\r\nlaboratory an impregnable chamber to safeguard his secret plans. He\r\ncalled it his Chest of Secrets, and guarded it well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Rolled Back a Small Rug]\r\n\r\nEven Ned Newton, Tom's closest friend and business associate, did not\r\nknow the entire contents of the massive vault. Only Tom and his father\r\nwere aware of all the inventions concealed there.\r\n\r\n\"Some of these inventions must not be known to the world in its present\r\nstate,\" the elder man had said.\r\n\r\nOne of them was the terrible electric death-ray, capable of destroying\r\nanything in its path. Only if the United States should be invaded by\r\nan enemy power, would this be revealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: There Was a Death Ray]\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said Tom, joining his chum after a few minutes spent in\r\nthe vault.\r\n\r\nHe was carrying a small wooden box which he placed on the desk and\r\nopened. If Ned, as he leaned over eagerly, expected to see anything\r\nastonishing he was disappointed. Resting on the velvet lining was simply\r\na round disk of a greenish substance perhaps six inches in diameter.\r\nThis was mounted in a gleaming metal ring from the edges of which there\r\nprojected five electric binding posts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Was Carrying a Wooden Box]\r\n\r\n\"Funny kind of an eye,\" observed Ned. \"You can't even see through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll soon see through it, all right,\" retorted Tom, laying the disk\r\non his desk and connecting four dry cells to the binding posts. He\r\nplaced a small rheostat in the circuit so that the strength of the\r\ncurrent might be regulated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Disk Was Mounted in a Metal Ring]\r\n\r\nSlowly he moved the little handle over the graduated dial. A minute\r\npassed during which, so far as Ned could see, nothing happened. Without\r\nwarning the green crystal suddenly glowed brightly for a fraction of a\r\nsecond, then could not be seen at all. The polished ring of metal in\r\nwhich it had been mounted alone remained.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone!\" cried Ned in bewilderment. \"I can see your desk top right\r\nthrough where it was!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" smiled the inventor, \"it's still there as you'll find if you try\r\nto poke your finger through the metal ring.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"It's Gone!\" Cried Ned]\r\n\r\nA trifle gingerly his chum extended his hand toward the circle of metal.\r\nThough Tom had assured him that the little disk was still in place, Ned\r\nwas unable to repress a start when his finger touched a cool, polished\r\nsurface which his eyes told him could not be there.\r\n\r\n\"Say, that's wonderful!\" he exclaimed, staring at the invisible\r\nsubstance with awe. \"That stuff must be a hundred times more transparent\r\nthan the finest plate glass!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: His Finger Touched the Cool Surface]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and more,\" said Tom. \"But that's not the most wonderful feature of\r\nthe new substance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's difficult to explain. Even now I know very little about it.\r\nI can tell you WHAT it can do, but the WHY is still as much of a mystery\r\nas ever. Briefly, this new element, or maybe it's a compound, I'm not\r\nsure which, reacts in a very strange manner to light. Let me show you.\r\nThat'll beat any long-winded theory I could spout.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"That's Wonderful!\" He Exclaimed]\r\n\r\nGoing to the door, Tom called in his giant servant Koku, who once had\r\nbeen a prince in his own far-off savage land, before Tom Swift had\r\nbrought him to Shopton.\r\n\r\n\"What want, Master?\" came a deep-toned reply, as the huge dark-skinned\r\nman, who stood a trifle over eight feet in height, entered.\r\n\r\n\"Just carry outside that telescope there in the corner,\" requested\r\nTom, pointing to the instrument. \"Better be careful; it's a bit heavy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom's Giant Servant Koku]\r\n\r\n\"Not heavy for Koku,\" boomed the giant. \"Liftum in one hand!\"\r\n\r\nThough it was not a large instrument as telescopes go, this one, with\r\nthe massive iron pier upon which it was mounted, weighed not far from\r\nfour hundred pounds. When Koku clamped his mighty hand about the stand\r\nhe seemed to lift it as easily as a boy might raise a baseball bat or\r\na golf club.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Koku Lifted It Easily]\r\n\r\n\"I'll never get used to his strength,\" murmured Ned as the boys followed\r\nthe giant through the laboratory door, Tom carrying his marvelous green\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\n\"He is a big boy, for fair,\" laughed Tom. \"Lucky for our prize-fighters\r\nhe hasn't gone into the ring.\"\r\n\r\nAfter carefully placing the telescope where the inventor directed, Koku\r\nreturned to the bench under a near-by apple tree where it was his wont\r\nto rest when he was not needed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Carried the Green Disk]\r\n\r\n\"Now what, Tom?\" questioned Ned. \"Surely you're not expecting to see\r\nstars in broad daylight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, though it could be done,\" returned Tom, pointing the instrument\r\ntoward the crest of a wooded hill several miles distant from Shopton.\r\n\"Now we're ready. Take a peek.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Ned, peering into the eyepiece, \"all I see are a few\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Take a Peek,\" Invited Tom]\r\n\r\n\"Just stand by,\" directed his friend, clamping his green disk over the\r\nfront lens, or objective, of the telescope and turning on the current.\r\nAs before, the green stuff seemed to vanish. \"Now, look again,\" he said.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Ned put his eye to the instrument than he gave a start.\r\n\"It's magic!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, that hill seems as if it were right\r\nhere and the view is much brighter. I can see every leaf on the trees\r\nand--yes! even a bird's nest and the little birds in it!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"It's Magic!\" He Exclaimed]\r\n\r\n\"Now maybe you have an idea as to how I propose to discover the secret\r\nof life on the planets,\" responded Tom calmly.\r\n\r\n\"The secret? What do you mean? Surely you don't expect to see men on\r\nMars!\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean to build a telescope with a space eye big enough and powerful\r\nenough to do it!\" The young inventor's face lit up with a strange light.\r\n\"It's the greatest thing yet, Ned!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"What Do You Mean?\" Asked Ned]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSUSPICIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ned dubiously, \"if you can do it. Oh, I'll admit that your\r\ninvention improves a telescope marvelously. But to see life on another\r\nworld, millions of miles away--well, that sounds like a pretty tall\r\norder even for you, Tom Swift!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"That Sounds Like a Tall Order!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Let's go back in the lab and I'll tell you more about the project.\"\r\n\r\nTom directed Koku to carry the telescope inside. As the three walked\r\nback, the giant suddenly gave a yell.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Master!\"\r\n\r\nWith that the servant let go the big instrument, placing it with a thud\r\nnone too gently on the hard ground. In a bound he was off. Tom and Ned\r\ncaught a glimpse of someone just disappearing around the edge of the\r\nbuilding. Had the stranger sneaked into the laboratory while Koku's\r\nback was turned?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Koku Bounded Off]\r\n\r\n\"I hope the space eye isn't smashed!\" exclaimed Tom, examining the\r\ninstrument. \"Or the telescope lens.\"\r\n\r\nAnxiously Ned waited as his chum detached the green disk and held it up.\r\n\r\n\"I--I guess it's O.K.,\" said Tom at length. \"I'll test it in the lab and\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I Hope the Space Eye Isn't Smashed!\"]\r\n\r\nAt this moment Koku reappeared, saying the intruder had vanished.\r\nMoreover, he was very contrite about having handled the telescope\r\nroughly. In a few seconds the fears of the three vanished. Put to the\r\nelectric test, the disk was found to be all right.\r\n\r\n\"Who do you suppose was sneaking around here?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"No telling,\" replied Tom. \"But nothing seems to be missing,\" he added,\r\nglancing around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Nothing Seems to Be Missing.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I hope you're right,\" said Ned. \"Now tell me more about this green\r\ndisk. How did you happen to discover the stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"As to just what it is,\" replied the other slowly, \"I'm not sure yet.\r\nWhen I analyzed it, I found a substance absolutely new to chemistry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it?\" asked Ned.\r\n\r\n\"I scraped it from that meteorite down in Koku's country in South\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nNed whistled. \"Ever since we found that thing which we called a planet\r\nstone, you've been discovering all sorts of things about it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I Scraped It From a Meteorite.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Right now I hope to revolutionize the field of astronomy with it,\" said\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me more about this wonderful green substance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be a new compound or it may be an unknown element. Anyway, in\r\nexperimenting with it I found that heat and electricity both change the\r\nstuff. The former has an apparently permanent effect, while an electric\r\ncurrent, as you saw, alters it only temporarily.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Heat and Electricity Change It.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you make a big disk? Then you could have tested your theory\r\nright away,\" stated Ned Newton.\r\n\r\n\"For two good reasons,\" replied Tom, opening a drawer and taking out a\r\nsmall vial filled with yellow powder. \"I wasn't sure it would improve a\r\ntelescope for one thing, and this is the other.\" He handed the bottle to\r\nNed. \"This is all I have on hand of the new stuff.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"This Is All I Have.\"]\r\n\r\n\"'X,'\" murmured Ned, reading the label. \"But this powder isn't green.\r\nAnd why the X?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the stuff is melted and then cooled it changes color,\" explained\r\nTom. \"As for the X, if you remember your algebra you know that letter\r\nstands for the unknown quantity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too bad you can't make a huge green disk.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"This Powder Isn't Green!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that,\" smiled his friend. \"I'll soon have plenty of\r\nthe powder. You haven't forgotten how the natives of Giant Land feared\r\nthe meteorite and insisted that we take it away. It seems, however, that\r\nwe got but a small piece of it. Evidently when it struck the ground the\r\nthing split, the heavier portion burying itself deep in the earth while\r\nthe part we found remained near the surface.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"An Earthquake Caused the Upheaval.\"]\r\n\r\n\"About six weeks ago Koku got a letter from his brother, King Amo of\r\nGiant Land, telling of an earthquake which caused the upheaval of the\r\nhuge stone. His people think we are great magicians or else witch\r\ndoctors, and Amo wrote begging us to take the meteorite from his land.\r\nOf course, I was only too glad to oblige 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you plan going to South America--\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my passport, but I'm glad to hear that!\" exclaimed a voice from\r\nthe open doorway. \"It seems as if I'm just in time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Damon!\" cried both boys together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Mr. Damon!\" Cried Both Boys]\r\n\r\nA jolly-looking, rather portly gentleman entered, swinging his cane\r\nexcitedly. Tom and Ned gave him a warm welcome, for he was a friend of\r\nlong standing and had accompanied them on many an expedition to remote\r\nquarters of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" invited Tom. \"Sit down, Mr. Damon, and tell us the news.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was it you were so tickled to hear just now?\" added Ned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Come in and Tell us the News!\"]\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you,\" said the rather eccentric man, for once forgetting to\r\nbless something. \"I'm in trouble, boys, and I need your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know we'll do anything we can, Mr. Damon,\" Tom assured him. \"Just\r\nwhat is the difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife,\" said the caller glumly. \"She's the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'm in Trouble, Boys.\"]\r\n\r\nOn hearing this both boys experienced no little difficulty in keeping\r\ntheir faces straight. Although Mrs. Damon was a fine woman in many ways,\r\nshe was inclined to be very domineering where her husband was\r\nconcerned. Ever since Tom Swift had rescued the man from a band of\r\nkidnapers, Mrs. Damon had had a great liking for the youthful scientist.\r\nYet she felt that her husband should remain quietly at home with her and\r\nnot go off on any wild trips, as the good lady called them.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see--well, suppose you explain,\" suggested Tom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Bless My Headache Pills!\"]\r\n\r\n\"My wife wants me to go on a week-end house party with her next Friday\r\nand I detest 'em. Bless my headache pills, but it's enough to drive a\r\nman distracted. Now, I heard you boys talking about South America as I\r\ncame in and I want to go along!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Damon, if we were going South you know I'd be only too\r\npleased to have you a member of the party. But Ned and I were merely\r\ntalking about a shipment of freight I'm expecting from Giant Land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Koku's country?\" asked Mr. Damon, somewhat astonished. \"I thought\r\nAmbolata was still unknown to commerce. Bless my bill-of-lading, if the\r\nworld isn't moving faster than I thought!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Some Freight From Giant Land]\r\n\r\nTom smiled. \"I had to arrange for an expedition through the consular\r\noffice at Buenos Aires to get what I want. It seems we didn't receive\r\nall of that strange meteorite even with the help of your magic wig.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Smiled and Explained]\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Damon had to laugh when he recalled the ludicrous situation\r\nin which he had been placed in the jungles of South America. Surrounded\r\nby savages, he had absent-mindedly taken off his wig, thereby\r\nfrightening the simple natives half out of their wits. They had thought\r\nhe could scalp himself at will. Nevertheless, this action had saved the\r\nlives of Tom Swift and his party, ultimately enabling them to escape\r\nwhen the giants turned against them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Thought He Could Scalp Himself]\r\n\r\n\"Ah, those were the days, Tom,\" sighed the eccentric man, \"those were\r\nthe days! Even if you're not going off to the wilds, maybe you might\r\ngive me some kind of a job here so that my wife can't drag me off to\r\nthat house party. I feel it in my very bones that old Hiram Leatherby\r\nwill be there and he ALWAYS singles me out to talk about his fossil\r\ncollection!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can sympathize with you,\" muttered Ned. \"Mr. Leatherby used to be a\r\ndirector in the bank where I worked before Tom made me his business\r\nmanager, and I've often thought he was a bit fossilized himself!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'll See What Can Be Done.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Damon, I'll see what can be done,\" promised Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" came an enthusiastic exclamation. \"Bless my cup of tea, I'm\r\ncounting on you!\"\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, why don't you go up to the house and have our\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Baggert, make you a cup of tea? Stop in the library\r\nand see Dad. He's been working too hard lately on his electrical book\r\nand he needs company.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Stop in and See Dad.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I will, Tom. Your father is a mighty fine man. Oh, my goodness! Bless\r\nmy poor memory, Tom, but I had some news for you. Good or bad I don't\r\nknow, but I feel uneasy about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell us what it is,\" suggested the young inventor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Two Men Called on Me.\"]\r\n\r\n\"It's a rather odd thing. You see, last evening I was reading my paper\r\non the porch when two men called on me. Said they were long-lost\r\nrelatives--cousins, or something of the sort--just back from a stay in\r\nSouth Africa. They seemed nice enough fellows, but bless my family tree,\r\nI had never heard of 'em! At any rate, they seemed to know a good deal\r\nabout the Damon family and so I asked them to dinner. What got me\r\nthinking something might not be right was the way those chaps tried to\r\npump me about you, Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pump you?\" asked young Swift, a puzzled look on his face. \"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Glass,\" said the eccentric character promptly. \"Some kind of glass.\r\nBless my windshield-wiper, what was it? Oh, yes! Flexible glass, that\r\nwas it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"They Tried to Pump Me.\"]\r\n\r\nTom and Ned exchanged startled glances. For many months experiments\r\ndirected toward the production of a glass as bendable as rubber had been\r\ngoing forward in the Swift plant. Every possible precaution had been\r\ntaken to cloak the work in deepest secrecy, yet somewhere evidently a\r\nleak had developed among Tom's employees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom and Ned Exchanged Glances]\r\n\r\n\"Are these men still at your home, Mr. Damon?\" asked Ned, a worried look\r\non his face.\r\n\r\n\"No, they left after dinner. Mr. Brown said they had some important\r\nbusiness up state. Is this glass business some new invention, Tom?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope it will be. So far my experiments haven't turned out\r\nsuccessfully. But I can't understand how anyone outside our plant could\r\nhave known about them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"They Left After Dinner.\"]\r\n\r\nMr. Damon could tell little more about his self-styled relatives.\r\nAfter giving a description of the two men he took his leave. The boys\r\nwere rather worried about the information he had brought along.\r\n\r\n\"It's not so much the glass,\" said Tom, \"for we don't know if it will be\r\na success. What bothers me is the idea of there being a traitor in the\r\nshops. I thought we had weeded out all unscrupulous employees.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Described the Two Men]\r\n\r\n\"The Apex Glass Works are located in Portville,\" said Ned, struck with\r\nan idea, \"fifty miles north of here. Mr. Damon's visitors claimed to\r\nhave business up state. To my mind that's more than a coincidence,\r\nespecially since the Apex people would give their back teeth to get hold\r\nof your formula, Tom!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"That's More Than Coincidence.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAN ACCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think you're letting your imagination run away with you, Ned,\"\r\ngrinned Tom. \"I know Mr. Stern, the president of Apex, very well, and\r\nI'm positive that he wouldn't stand for any underhanded tactics.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I Know Mr. Stern,\" Grinned Tom]\r\n\r\n\"I hope you're right,\" said his business manager. \"But you know better\r\nthan anyone else how unscrupulous gangs have tried to steal your\r\ninventions. At first it was Happy Harry the tramp, and the last was\r\nDoctor Bane. No telling how many thugs were after you and your father in\r\nbetween. You'd be wise to get some extra guards.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think Koku is well able to handle any intruder,\" declared Tom\r\nconfidently. \"Besides, I think you're getting excited over nothing. You\r\nknow Mr. Damon is inclined to make mountains out of molehills.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Koku Is Able to Handle Anyone.\"]\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well,\" persisted his friend stubbornly, \"but just\r\nsuppose Mr. Damon is right in his suspicions? It'd be too late then to\r\ndo anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, old man. My Chest of Secrets will hold its contents secure\r\nagainst any burglar's attack. Now it's late. You'd better stay to\r\ndinner. Afterward, if you care to and have no other date, we can talk\r\nover some unfinished business.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chest Would Guard the Secrets]\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Tom. I'll be glad to spend the evening with you.\"\r\n\r\nLocking up the laboratory, the two boys walked leisurely through the\r\nwarm June twilight toward the big white house. Low in the sky hung the\r\nsilvery crescent of the new moon, while almost overhead Mars glowed\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\n\"There's our goal, Ned,\" murmured Tom, pointing to the red planet. \"I\r\nfeel sure that our meteorite came from that far-off world!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"There's Our Goal, Ned.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Granting that it did come from another planet,\" objected Ned, \"I don't\r\nget the reason why you're so sure it came from Mars. There are nine\r\nplanets circling the sun, including the earth. Ruling out the sun, it\r\nseems to me that there is but one chance in eight that you are right.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Nine Planets Circle the Sun.\"]\r\n\r\n\"If it were simply a matter of chance, there'd be a lot of weight behind\r\nyour argument, Ned. But a lot of other factors enter the problem. I\r\nshould say that the only planets where life as we know it might exist\r\nare Mars and Venus. The latter I ruled out, for astronomers have found\r\nthat it is forever covered thickly with dense clouds. Thus the\r\ninhabitants, if any, must be ignorant of any world but their own.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have people on the planets got to do with the question, anyhow?\"\r\nasked Ned. \"Huge chunks of metal break off of any heavenly body and go\r\nhurtling through space. The inhabitants don't throw them off!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chunks of Metal Rushing Through Space]\r\n\r\n\"But our meteor was no ordinary one as we have proved already,\" replied\r\nTom. \"I firmly believe that someone on another planet deliberately fired\r\nthat missile into space, hoping it would reach this world. Since\r\nscientists agree that Mars probably is inhabited by a highly intelligent\r\nrace, that planet is a reasonable guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" whistled Ned. \"Such ideas are beyond me.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Someone on Another Planet Fired the Missile.\"]\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking, the boys reached the Swift residence. The\r\nyoung inventor's father had built the handsome white house many years\r\nbefore his son was born. Beyond were the several buildings where the\r\ninventions of Tom Swift and his father, Barton Swift, were manufactured.\r\n\r\nOf recent years the latter had not been active, but had put the affairs\r\nin the hands of his capable son Tom, ably assisted by Ned Newton. The\r\nolder man now spent most of his time writing scientific books and\r\narticles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Boys Reached the Swift Residence]\r\n\r\nThe boys washed as quickly as possible so as not to delay dinner, for\r\nboth possessed healthy appetites. Joining Mr. Swift in the library, they\r\nfound him and Mr. Damon deep in a game of chess.\r\n\r\n\"Check!\" cried Tom's father triumphantly, moving his king. \"Got you\r\nagain, Damon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my pawns and castles!\" exclaimed the eccentric gentleman. \"You've\r\nwon three straight games!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Swift, Tom's Father]\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Dad!\" said Tom suddenly. \"I see you're up to your old tricks!\"\r\nIn spite of his bantering tone the young inventor was pleased that his\r\nfather was relaxing in a friendly game.\r\n\r\n\"Your father shouldn't be in the amateur class any more, Tom!\" Mr. Damon\r\ngrumbled playfully. \"Bless my trophy cup, but I'm afraid to play with\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\n\"Better luck next time,\" consoled Mr. Swift, a twinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\nMr. Damon left, refusing an invitation to dinner and saying that he\r\nhad to take his car to a garage for a minor repair job before starting\r\nfor his home in Waterford, a near-by town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Hello, Dad,\" Said Tom]\r\n\r\n\"How goes it with you, son?\" asked Mr. Swift when Tom returned from\r\nseeing his guest to the door. \"Your new space eye, as you call it--is it\r\nworking out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, Dad, but wait until I get the big model built!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Saw Mr. Damon to the Door]\r\n\r\n\"Genmens, dinnah am serbed!\" An old negro thrust his white-fringed\r\nhead through the library door. \"An' it sho' am good!\" Eradicate Sampson,\r\nso-called for his work in younger days of eradicating dirt from the\r\nhomes of Shopton, had been attached to the Swift household for many\r\nyears and now regarded himself as one of the family.\r\n\r\nAs they sat at table the conversation of the three turned naturally to\r\nTom's latest invention. Mr. Swift had not heard yet all Tom's ideas of\r\nthe proposed telescope and was full of eager questions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eradicate Sampson]\r\n\r\n\"Just how long do you think it will take to make your big disk, son?\"\r\nasked Mr. Swift. \"That is, if you find any more of the new material.\"\r\n\r\n\"The meteorite is already on board a north-bound freight steamer,\"\r\nanswered Tom, \"and ought to get here within the next ten days. It'll\r\nrequire at least three weeks to extract all the X and cast it into\r\nshape. Taking everything into consideration, I should say it will be\r\nat least six weeks before we can test the device. The matter depends\r\nentirely on finding a lot of X in the planet stone. But I'm sure I\r\nshall.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Meteorite Is Northbound!\"]\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the boys went over to the main office of the Swift\r\nConstruction Company to clear up a number of routine business matters\r\nwhich required Tom's personal attention. He had postponed them for a\r\nwhile to give more time to his new experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Boys Went to the Main Office]\r\n\r\n\"Now, young fellow, I'm not letting you get away until you've looked\r\nover these papers!\" declared Ned, pretending to threaten his chum with a\r\nyardstick. \"I've been after you for a week about 'em!\"\r\n\r\nTom dodged and pretended to be scared. \"You're right, though,\" he\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nThe two worked rapidly. Within an hour the seemingly endless stack of\r\ndocuments had shrunk to a few letters and bills. Just as Ned was\r\nreaching for one of them the telephone rang in the outer office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Two Worked Rapidly]\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it, Tom,\" his chum said.\r\n\r\n\"Sit still,\" replied the young inventor. \"I'll switch it to my private\r\nphone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom Swift speaking,\" he said into the mouthpiece a moment later. \"Oh,\r\nhello, Mrs. Damon. What's that? But I don't understand. No, there must\r\nbe some mistake!\" A loud click sounded in the receiver and Tom jerked\r\nthe instrument from his ear.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Ned, noting his friend's serious face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Jerked the Instrument From His Ear]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Damon's been hurt in an auto accident. For some reason his wife is\r\nblaming it on me! Come, we must get to the hospital at once!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Mr. Damon's Been Hurt!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA MURDEROUS ATTEMPT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You drive, Tom,\" said Ned, for they had come from the Swift home in his\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n\"O.K., and hang onto your hat!\"\r\n\r\nTom Swift had once driven a fast racing auto of his own design and Ned\r\nknew his chum could get the most out of his roadster. In a few seconds\r\nthe little car reached the gate of the works, where the watchman halted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Hang on to Your Hat.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, an' 'tiz you agin, Misther Swift,\" said Malligan. \"Sure, an' I\r\nwouldn't have stopped yez but me orders is to inspect iveryone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did right, Pat,\" commended Tom, shifting gears. \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe Shopton Hospital was located a couple of miles from the Swift plant.\r\nUnder the young scientist's guidance the roadster reached its entrance\r\nwithin a few minutes. At the information desk the boys were informed\r\nwhere Mr. Damon had been taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Reached the Hospital]\r\n\r\n\"Room 302, Mr. Swift. Doctor Chilton is with him now.\"\r\n\r\nJust as the boys reached Room 302 the physician came out. Tom was glad\r\nto note that the man was smiling.\r\n\r\n\"How is he, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"How Is He, Doctor?\"]\r\n\r\n\"Hello, boys. Mr. Damon will be as good as new in a week or so. Barring\r\na sprained wrist his injuries are trifling--a few bruises and a slight\r\ncut. From the way he's blessing everything in the place no one would\r\nthink he was hurt in the least!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm relieved,\" said Tom. \"May we see him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go right in. He'll be glad to have some company. But don't stay too\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless my operating table, if it isn't Tom and Ned!\" exclaimed Mr.\r\nDamon, seeing his visitors enter. The eccentric gentleman was propped\r\nup in bed by several pillows. His left arm was in a sling and around his\r\nhead was a big bandage. \"You two got here almost as quickly as I did.\r\nBut I'm glad they didn't have to carry you in!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Damon Was Propped up in Bed]\r\n\r\n\"Your wife phoned me the news,\" explained Tom. \"We're mighty glad you\r\nweren't injured badly. Tell us how it happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"It all occurred so suddenly that I hardly know myself. But I know one\r\nthing!\" Mr. Damon seemed very indignant. \"The scoundrels deliberately\r\nran into my car!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The Scoundrels Ran into My Car!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Did you get their license number?\" inquired Ned Newton. \"If you did,\r\nI'll call the police!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I couldn't see it in the dark. But I know the villains well enough.\r\nThey were my two so-called relatives that I told you about--Jones and\r\nBrown! It was spite work for my refusal to tell 'em about your glass!\"\r\n\r\nTom now saw the reason why Mrs. Damon was blaming him for the accident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"My Two So-Called Relatives.\"]\r\n\r\n\"We'll notify the authorities and also do a little detective work\r\nourselves,\" he said. \"We must leave now because the doctor wants you to\r\nget some rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back again, boys. At any rate, I've escaped that house party!\"\r\n\r\nAfter reporting the accident at the local police station, Tom and Ned\r\nvisited all the garages and repair shops in the little town in an\r\nattempt to learn if any damaged machine had been brought in. They met\r\nwith no success, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Visited All the Garages]\r\n\r\n\"Guess their bus wasn't hurt much,\" commented Ned as they left the last\r\nplace. \"We might as well give up for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"The police will be on the job. Unless the two men hid the car somewhere\r\nit's sure to be found. The teletype will flash the word all through the\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\nThe following morning the Police Chief telephoned Tom to tell him that\r\nno trace of the mysterious Jones and Brown could be discovered, nor\r\nhad any witness to the accident been located.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Police Chief Called Tom]\r\n\r\nLater Ned went to the hospital where he found Mr. Damon much improved\r\nand able to sit up in a wheel chair. After a visit with him he attended\r\nto some business at the bank. On returning to the Swift plant, he found\r\nTom busy with his green disk, which once more was clamped to the little\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Damon is a lot better,\" Ned reported, watching his friend's work\r\ncuriously. \"When I left him he was blessing his hat and coat, so I\r\nsuppose he's eager to get out of the hospital.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Damon Was Much Improved]\r\n\r\n\"That's great,\" said Tom. \"I knew he was getting along all right. I was\r\ntoo busy to go with you so I called Doctor Chilton. He told me that the\r\nX-ray showed no broken bones, but our friend must remain under\r\nobservation for a few days more.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've changed the wiring on the disk, haven't you?\" asked Ned, who\r\nknew a little about electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I Want to Try Alternating Current.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I want to try alternating current instead of direct and see if doing so\r\nwon't improve it. Dad suggested that. What is it, Koku?\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy bringum letter for Master. Say must put name on book.\" The man held\r\nout an envelope and pad.\r\n\r\n\"It's a radiogram. Sign for me, Ned, will you?\"\r\n\r\nTom ripped open the envelope and glanced over the message.\r\n\r\n\"Bad news?\" asked his chum, seeing a changed expression on the\r\ninventor's face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Ripped Open the Envelope]\r\n\r\n\"I should say so. Here, read it yourself. We might just as well forget\r\nthe whole telescope idea, that's how bad it is!\"\r\n\r\nNed took the sheet, which Tom had crumpled, spread it out on the desk,\r\nand read as follows:\r\n\r\n   \"Regret inform you was compelled to jettison your cargo last night in\r\n   bad storm to save ship. Approximate location four miles due east Port\r\n   Baracoa, Cuba. Salvage boat take position at apex isosceles triangle\r\n   27.6 degrees with lighthouse and summit hill a mile to the south.\"\r\n\r\n   \"(Signed) A. Mawson,\r\n   Captain S.S. Perry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Was Compelled to Jettison Your Cargo.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Say, Tom, that IS tough, having your meteorite thrown overboard!\"\r\nexclaimed Ned, rereading the message. \"All your work wasted and your\r\nmarvelous invention junked--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\" broke in the young scientist grimly as he grabbed the\r\ntelephone from his desk. \"Hello, operator, get me long distance,\r\nplease.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Grabbed the Telephone]\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Ned excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"Get divers,\" replied Tom as he waited. \"I'm going to recover that\r\nmeteorite or know the reason--Oh, hello! Yes. I want the main office of\r\nthe Neptune Salvage Company in New York City. No, I haven't the address.\r\nYes, I'll hold the line.\r\n\r\n\"These people are experts,\" he told his chum while waiting for his\r\ncall to be put through. \"If the stone isn't in too deep water they'll be\r\nable to raise it if anyone can.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'm Going to Recover the Meteorite.\"]\r\n\r\n\"But how can they ever find it? Seems to me it'll be like hunting for\r\nthe proverbial needle in a haystack, only more so!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite that bad. Captain Mawson gives what seem to be pretty\r\ncomplete directions. You might try getting any further data the man may\r\nhave.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Captain Mawson Gave Directions.\"]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Tom, as he learned in the next two hours, the\r\nNeptune Company and other salvage concerns he called were very busy and\r\ncould not spare a barge of the required size. Moreover, Ned could get no\r\nmore information, when he finally contacted the freighter, than her\r\ncommander had given already.\r\n\r\n\"Why doan yo' tak' yo' submarine boat down dere, Massa Tom?\" asked\r\nEradicate as he served luncheon to the young inventor, his father and\r\nNed. \"Ah 'members we once got some treasure off'n de bottom ob de sea\r\ndat way.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eradicate Served Luncheon]\r\n\r\n\"I did think of that, Rad,\" answered Tom a bit wearily, \"but my ship\r\nisn't big enough to raise such a great weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so, son,\" said the elder Swift, \"if you can't get the use of a\r\nlarge salvage craft you will have to give up your project; is that\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, Dad, and I surely hate to think of it. But I'm not going\r\nto give up, even if I have to bring men and equipment from the Pacific\r\ncoast!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'm Not Going to Give Up!\"]\r\n\r\n\"That'd be mighty expensive,\" objected Ned. In his capacity as the\r\nSwifts' business manager, he had earned the nickname \"watchdog of the\r\ntreasury.\" \"Why not wait until some local firm can take the job?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too risky. You see, ocean currents or some submarine upheaval might\r\nshift the big stone so great a distance that we could never find it.\r\nDon't forget that to the best of our knowledge the meteorite is the only\r\nsource of X on earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Ocean Currents Might Shift the Stone.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Hmm,\" frowned Mr. Swift. \"I used to know an old fellow very well who\r\nwas in the diving business. Met him when we built the submarine\r\n'Advance'--you boys remember her--but I can't seem to recall his name.\r\nLet me see--Ha! I have it! Britten! That's it, John Britten, the best\r\nsalvage man on the coast!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he's busy too,\" said Ned, \"as all the others seem to be.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Maybe He's Busy, Too.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied the elderly scientist, \"because he's retired.\r\nYet I believe he'll undertake the job if I ask him as I once did him a\r\ngreat favor. His salvaging outfit is in Florida, but he lives on\r\nDelaware Bay. I'll phone him at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's great, Dad!\" cried Tom, his face lighting up with renewed hope.\r\n\"Tell him I'll bring him here by plane tomorrow. We can talk things over\r\nand start for Florida from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll go,\" said Mr. Swift a few minutes later, turning away from the\r\ntelephone with a smile. \"Said he'll be tickled to get back in\r\nharness.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"He'll Go,\" Said Mr. Swift]\r\n\r\n\"Thanks a million, Dad! You've saved the day!\"\r\n\r\nThe following morning the boys hurried out to the Swift private airport\r\nto oversee the fueling of the huge plane Tom had decided to take. At\r\nfirst he had thought of making the trip in his small two-seated racer,\r\nsince it was the fastest craft in the hangar. Realizing, however, that\r\nCaptain Britten might want to bring along considerable baggage, the\r\nyoung inventor had told Ned he felt it best to go in his flying boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Fueled the Huge Plane]\r\n\r\nThe \"Winged Arrow,\" in which Tom once had made a memorable rescue flight\r\nto Iceland, was equipped now with a retractable landing gear as well as\r\nwith pontoons, enabling the craft to descend on both land and water.\r\nSuddenly Tom became very excited as he looked at the hydroplane.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Ned!\" he cried. \"Can you beat that!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Look, Ned,\" Tom Cried]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIN PERIL\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon inspection, it was found that three half-inch holes had been\r\ndrilled into each pontoon. It was evident that only an enemy of Tom or\r\nof the Swift Company could have done such a thing.\r\n\r\n\"Ned, that proves it!\" declared the young inventor gloomily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three Holes in Each Pontoon]\r\n\r\n\"Proves what?\" Ned asked.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see? It all ties in with Mr. Damon's so-called relatives, and\r\ntheir knowledge of my formula for a bendable glass. Someone in our shops\r\nis a traitor--or worse!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has a damaged hydroplane to do with that?\" objected Ned.\r\n\r\n\"If we had landed on water with these damaged pontoons, we'd have\r\ndrowned most likely,\" replied Tom. \"That would have suited the\r\nvillains who want my formula, and no one would have been the wiser as\r\nto what caused the accident.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We'd Have Been Drowned!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Admitting you're right, the thing's a pretty serious mess,\" said Ned.\r\n\"But of course crooked people will go to long lengths for money, and if\r\nyour formula is a good one, it certainly will bring a lot of money to\r\nsomeone or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that something is going to be the Swift Company!\" declared Tom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"It's a Pretty Serious Mess.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Since we can't take off in the hydroplane today,\" said Ned, \"let's go\r\nback to the office. I suppose it'll require some time to patch up those\r\nholes.\"\r\n\r\nTom immediately sent for one of his skilled mechanics, a man whom he\r\nknew to be trustworthy. He set the fellow to work welding patches over\r\nthe holes. After cautioning his employee to maintain strict silence, he\r\nand Ned drove away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Welded Patches Over the Holes]\r\n\r\n\"Don't say anything to Dad about this,\" warned Tom as the two left the\r\nfield. \"It would only worry him and could do no good. You and I must\r\nwork out this mess by ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAfter dinner that evening Tom went to his private laboratory to check\r\nthe thermostat controlling the temperature of the annealing oven in\r\nwhich his batch of new glass was being slowly cooled. Then he spent some\r\ntime at his desk over certain intricate formulas. The room was in\r\nsemi-darkness, lighted only by a shaded reading lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Checked the Thermostat]\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's that,\" yawned the young inventor at length, locking up his\r\ndesk. \"Guess I'd better put the valuable disk back in the vault before I\r\ngo home,\" he decided, switching on the ceiling lights and glancing\r\ntoward the corner where Koku had placed the telescope.\r\n\r\nWith a start he saw that his invention was gone!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: His Invention Was Gone]\r\n\r\nQuickly examining the instrument, he found that the green disk had been\r\njerked roughly from its clamps by someone who evidently had been in\r\ntoo great a hurry to bother unscrewing the bolts which had held it in\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" suddenly boomed a deep voice. Tom became aware of a commotion\r\noutside the laboratory. \"You no get 'way fum me! How you like 'nother\r\nknock on top head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't hit me again!\" whined someone. \"I won't try to escape!\"\r\n\r\nTom flung open the door and saw his giant servant dragging a man up\r\nthe steps. A feeling of tremendous relief swept over young Swift as he\r\ndiscovered his precious green disk in Koku's left hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Koku Was Dragging a Man]\r\n\r\n\"Ha, Master Tom! Catchum bad mans tryin' to sneak through gate! See\r\ngreen thing stick out of pocket and grabbum--bringum here. Want me\r\nhittum again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please don't let him hurt me, Mr. Swift,\" snivelled the man. \"He hit me\r\nan awful blow back there.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Want Me Hittum Again?\"]\r\n\r\n\"You had it coming to you,\" retorted Tom sternly. \"Besides, you're not\r\nhurt very much. Koku, bring him in here. You certainly did a good piece\r\nof work when you nabbed this fellow. Take him into the office and we'll\r\nhave a word or two with him before I call the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't talkin',\" muttered the man, shifting uncomfortably and looking\r\nrather uneasily at the giant. \"You ain't got nothin' on me. I just found\r\nthat chunk of green glass in the field.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"You Ain't Got Nothin' on Me.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Don't lie to me, unless you want to be mussed up some more,\" said Tom\r\ngrimly, glancing at Koku. \"I think I'll just take a look through your\r\npockets. Perhaps you found a few other little things when you broke in\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the menacing eye of the giant, the man submitted sullenly to the\r\nsearch. There was nothing in his clothes to identify him. Apparently he\r\nhad stolen nothing else from the laboratory. He refused to answer any\r\nquestions, however. Tom gave up and summoned the police by telephone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Searched the Man]\r\n\r\n\"O Master, here other thing in man's pocket!\" exclaimed Koku, after the\r\nthief had been carted away to jail. \"It stuck to round green thing when\r\nI yank away from um.\" He handed Tom a bit of pasteboard from which the\r\nlower third had been torn.\r\n\r\n\"It's a business card of the Apex Glass Works with the representative's\r\nname ripped off!\" exclaimed young Swift aloud. Then to himself he added,\r\n\"I wonder? Maybe Ned was right after all and they ARE after my formula\r\nfor bendable glass!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Business Card]\r\n\r\nTom immediately called the home of Mr. Stern, head of the glass works,\r\nto whom he related the occurrence. The executive was shocked and very\r\nindignant at the thought of there being a criminal among his employees\r\nand promised to investigate thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you don't think I had anything to do with this, Mr. Swift!\" the\r\nman exclaimed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Executive Was Shocked]\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least, sir. But if you turn up any clues, I hope you'll let\r\nme know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I most assuredly will. You may count on my help.\"\r\n\r\nAn early hour next day found Tom and Ned flying south over the sandy\r\ncoast of New Jersey. Every inch of the \"Winged Arrow\" had been\r\nthoroughly inspected, but no other signs of damage had been discovered.\r\nEven so, the young business manager sat a bit uneasily in his seat as he\r\npeered out anxiously at the broad wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom and Ned Flew South]\r\n\r\n\"Afraid they'll drop off, old man?\" grinned Tom. \"Don't worry. We\r\nX-rayed 'em and no struts have been filed nor any time-bombs planted!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh, I was just looking at the weather,\" grunted Ned indignantly. He\r\nwas secretly relieved, for he had been pondering how easily a charge of\r\ndynamite could have been secreted aboard ship. \"How soon do you think\r\nwe'll reach Delaware Bay?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Was Uneasy]\r\n\r\n\"Within the next twenty minutes,\" answered his chum, glancing at the\r\ninstrument board. \"Mr. Britten is to meet us at a dock near Lewes.\"\r\n\r\nLess than half an hour later the pontoons of the \"Winged Arrow\" were\r\nplowing through the waters of Delaware Bay toward a near-by pier. A\r\nwharf attendant caught the line Ned threw him and the ship was moored\r\nsecurely to a stout post.\r\n\r\nAs Tom and his companion climbed up, a grizzled-looking old man hailed\r\nthem in a voice that seemed well able to travel from quarterdeck to\r\nfo'c'sle even in the teeth of a hurricane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Plane Plowed Through the Waters]\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy there!\" he bellowed, though scarcely twenty feet away. \"Are you\r\nyoung Swift and company?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right you are. Captain Britten, I take it?\"\r\n\r\nVastly flattered by the title, the red-faced old seaman warmly shook\r\nhands with the boys. \"Correct ye are, me lad. Your good father tells\r\nme you need a bit o' salvagin' done an' I'm the man as'll do it proper!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Britten, the Grizzled Old Man]\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Captain!\" said Tom. \"That's exactly what my father said.\r\nAnd now, have you your equipment handy? If it's not too heavy we can\r\nload it aboard the plane right away. Oh, and I want to introduce my good\r\nfriend here, Ned Newton.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I Want to Introduce My Friend.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Glad to meet ye, shipmate! As for my salvagin' outfit, it's aboard\r\nship. We'll pick up my old barge, the 'Elizabeth B.,' but I calls her\r\nthe 'Betsy B.,' at Key West, where I keeps her anchored. She's in a\r\nmanner o' speakin' my winter home.\" Captain Britten picked up a huge,\r\nbattered old suitcase. \"If your flyin' machine is ready, so am I!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was obviously a trifle eccentric, but both boys were warmly\r\nattracted to him by his sincere and friendly manner. Besides, as Tom\r\nnoted, there was a certain air of competence about him, as if he was\r\nwell able to tackle and solve the hardest of problems in his line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Captain Britten Carried His Suitcase]\r\n\r\n\"Let's go, then!\" proposed Ned, motioning to the attendant to cast off\r\nand handing him a coin at the same time.\r\n\r\nListening to a number of quaint seafaring expressions from old Captain\r\nBritten, who was starting his first voyage into the upper air, Tom sent\r\nthe big craft roaring above the smooth water toward Shopton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Sent the Big Craft Roaring]\r\n\r\n\"How do you like flying, Captain Britten?\" Ned asked. \"Ever been up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess it's all right,\" rumbled the salvaging expert, looking\r\ndown at the sea dubiously. \"But to tell you the truth, I'm more at home\r\nON the water than OVER it!\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time the nose of the \"Winged Arrow\" turned inland as Tom set\r\nhis course direct for home. When they were nearing Shopton, the young\r\ninventor, intending to come down on solid ground, grasped the device\r\nwhich lowered the landing wheels. It seemed to work very stiffly, he\r\nthought, so he leaned over farther to exert more force. Suddenly there\r\ncame a snapping noise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Plane Turned Inland]\r\n\r\n\"What's up, Tom?\" called Ned, hearing the noise and seeing his chum\r\nfumbling with the now useless mechanism.\r\n\r\n\"Landing gear out of commission. But there's no need to worry as we can\r\ndescend on Lake Carlopa easily with the pontoons.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Landing Gear out of Commission.\"]\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" exclaimed Ned Newton, banging his fist on the instrument\r\npanel. \"Ten to one this is the work of the same scoundrel who bored\r\nholes in the floats. If I could get my hands on--\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you'll be in a condition to do so,\" cut in Tom in an oddly\r\nstrained voice. \"Take a look at the fuel gauge.\"\r\n\r\n\"It--it says zero! But that's impossible. We saw the tanks filled last\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Look at the Fuel Gauge.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Sure, and when we took off this morning the gauge showed they were\r\nstill full. Someone tampered with the pointer of the instrument and all\r\nbut drained the gas containers when they wrecked the landing gear. Just\r\nnow you dislodged the jammed needle when you struck the instrument board\r\nwith your fist.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we're in a pretty bad way, eh, Tom?\" asked Captain Britten calmly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We're in a Pretty Bad Way?\"]\r\n\r\n\"I'll say,\" replied young Swift grimly. \"We can't hope to reach\r\nCarlopa and there is nothing beneath us now but thick woodland. No\r\nquestion about it. A crack-up is the next thing on the program!\"\r\n\r\nAs he finished speaking, the starboard motor emitted a groaning cough\r\nand stopped. The port engine might run for another five minutes or it\r\nmight give out within the next five seconds!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Starboard Engine Stopped]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTOM DRUGGED!\r\n\r\n\r\nTom had headed the ship up at a steep angle so as to get as much\r\naltitude as possible before the other motor should stop. But he knew in\r\nhis heart that he could not hope to glide so heavy a plane as far as the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Headed the Ship Up]\r\n\r\nIn some surprise Ned observed that Captain Britten was fumbling with\r\nthe straps about his big, old-fashioned valise. Young Newton wondered\r\nwhat the elderly man was looking for so intensely.\r\n\r\n\"Ahoy there, Tom Swift!\" boomed the old diver, straightening up with a\r\nbottle in his hand. \"I've got a drop o' gasoline here that may help ye!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I've Got a Drop of Gasoline.\"]\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" gasped the pilot. Turning, he saw the quart bottle.\r\nAlready the remaining engine was dying of thirst. \"Quick, Ned!\" he\r\nordered, snatching the container. \"Take the controls and hold the ship\r\nlevel.\"\r\n\r\nFive seconds later the inventor was creeping out along one wing toward\r\nthe intake valve of the port gas tank. Their hearts almost in their\r\nmouths, his companions watched his hazardous progress. In spite of the\r\nclutching hand of the wind and the quavering of the ship under Ned's\r\ninexpert guidance, Tom managed to reach his goal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Crept Along One Wing]\r\n\r\nRemoving the cap with no little difficulty, he dumped the precious\r\ndrops of gasoline into the tank. In a few moments he got back to the\r\ncabin. As he closed the door the laboring engine once more resumed its\r\nfull-throated roar.\r\n\r\n\"Lad, you've got what it takes!\" rumbled Captain Britten, shaking Tom's\r\nhand approvingly. \"You're a mighty brave young fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean YOU had what it takes,\" laughed the inventor, taking over the\r\ncontrols preparatory to landing on Carlopa. \"Without that extra bit of\r\ngas we'd be piled up in a tree by now!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Emptied the Precious Drops]\r\n\r\nThe quart of fuel was just sufficient to carry the ship safely down to\r\nthe lake's surface at a point about three miles from the town.\r\nFortunately one of Tom's friends was sailing near-by in his cat-boat and\r\ngladly offered to take the three over to the Swift dock, which jutted\r\nout from the grounds behind Tom's home.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-afternoon before the \"Winged Arrow\" was towed across to the\r\ndock and her tanks refilled with high-test gasoline. While this was\r\nbeing done, Tom and Ned went to the home of Mr. Damon to ask if he would\r\nlike to accompany them to the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Saw a Friend]\r\n\r\nThe man was found to be sitting in an easy chair on his front porch,\r\nwhere he spent much time, now that he was home from the hospital.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Went to See Mr. Damon]\r\n\r\n\"Bless my parachute, I'd like nothing better than to make the trip!\" he\r\nsaid a trifle wistfully. \"To tell you the truth, though,\" his voice\r\nsank to a whisper, \"between the doctors and Mrs. Damon I'll be lucky if\r\nI'm allowed to walk around the block alone for some time to come!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's too bad, Mr. Damon. We were counting on you.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We Were Counting on You.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Bless my fishing tackle, Tom, I'm sorry too. But tell me! How did\r\nCaptain Britten happen to be carrying a quart of gasoline in his\r\nsatchel?\" asked the eccentric gentleman after he had been told of the\r\nairplane's narrow escape.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it strange myself,\" said Tom, \"but he claimed he always\r\ncarries some with him to remove grease spots from his clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! He must be quite a character. I suppose aboard a salvage boat folks\r\nget their clothes pretty dirty, at that.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the boys returned home it was decided that they and Mr. Britten\r\nwould set out for Florida the next morning. In the meantime, the\r\nelderly diver telegraphed his caretaker to get the \"Betsy B.\" in order\r\nand arrange to hire a tug-boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Planned to Start the Next Day]\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon Tom called his chum on the phone. \"Can you spare\r\nme a few minutes?\" he asked. \"Think I'm going to have something\r\ninteresting to show you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be right over,\" replied Ned. \"Where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the lab.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later young Newton had joined his friend. \"What's up?\"\r\nhe asked Tom as he entered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"What's up?\" Asked Ned]\r\n\r\nTom had discovered that his bendable glass mixture had cooled to a\r\ncritical temperature, making it necessary to remove it from the furnace\r\nat once lest it be ruined. In a small secret chamber beneath his private\r\nlaboratory he had set up a sort of miniature glass works which would\r\nhave astonished any ordinary glass worker, for the young inventor had\r\ndevised an entirely new method of procedure. As to its outcome, well,\r\neven to its inventor that feature remained in doubt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Miniature Glass Works]\r\n\r\n\"Do you think it'll work, Tom?\" asked Ned Newton anxiously as he\r\nfollowed the youthful scientist down the stairs. \"Your experiments have\r\ncost a mint of money already--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't croak,\" chuckled Tom. \"I've a few pennies left, haven't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't have so very many after you finish with your new telescope\r\nidea,\" declared Ned grimly. \"And THAT certainly won't bring in any\r\ndividends.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Followed Tom]\r\n\r\n\"Nor is it intended to,\" said Tom a bit sharply. \"There is, you know,\r\nsuch a thing as pursuing knowledge for its own sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry. You ought to know, though, that I'm thinking only of your\r\ninterests, not of mine,\" he said as they reached the room below.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, old man!\" Tom clapped Ned warmly on the back. \"Don't feel\r\nfor a minute that I don't appreciate everything you've done for me. To\r\ntell you the truth, I'm as worried about this new glass as you are.\r\nThat's why I jumped on you. Let's forget it!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Forgive Me, Old Man!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Right!\"\r\n\r\nThe two were standing now before the cylindrical furnace containing the\r\nmixture of silicates and other ingredients from which Tom Swift hoped\r\nwould emerge a glass as flexible as rubber and as strong as steel. The\r\nthermometer on the front stood at twenty-one degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Looked at the Thermometer]\r\n\r\n\"She's just right,\" muttered the inventor, consulting a complicated\r\nchart hanging on the wall. \"Now we'll see!\"\r\n\r\nThe asbestos-coated door clanged open. Tom drew out a shallow tray, the\r\ncontents of which were buried in a black powder.\r\n\r\n\"Charcoal!\" he explained, setting the pan on a table. \"It prevents any\r\nrapid temperature change. Even common glass must be cooled slowly or it\r\nbecomes as brittle as peanut candy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Drew out a Shallow Tray]\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a wooden rod Tom pulled out a glass bar about ten\r\ninches long and an inch thick. After picking it up carefully he examined\r\nit closely. In no way did the object appear different from ordinary\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here goes!\" said the inventor and forthwith bent the bar into the\r\nshape of a horseshoe!\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" yelled Ned, clapping his friend on the back. \"You've done it\r\nagain, Tom Swift!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Bent the Glass]\r\n\r\n\"Don't crow too soon. Perhaps it won't bend back again. If a rod of\r\ncopper is annealed in a certain way it can be bent ONCE like rubber but\r\nthen the crystal breaks up and it becomes as rigid as ever. Maybe this\r\nglass will act the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then try it! Don't keep me in suspense!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Tom had been tantalizing his business manager, or maybe he\r\nreally was doubtful about the flexibility of the bar. At any rate, when\r\nhe applied pressure he did not seem surprised when the glass became\r\nstraight again. Then he proceeded actually to tie a knot in it, so\r\nbendable was the new substance!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Glass Became Straight Again]\r\n\r\n\"This will revolutionize the glass industry!\" declared Ned, noting that\r\neven the blows of a heavy sledge-hammer failed even so much as to crack\r\nthe rod.\r\n\r\n\"It's not half as wonderful as that other kind of glass,\" said Tom,\r\ndreamily.\r\n\r\n\"Your glass eye, d'you mean?\" chuckled Ned in high good humor. In his\r\nmind he could already see fat profits for the company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Heavy Hammer Did Not Crack It]\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you a pair of black eyes if you make another bad joke!\"\r\nlaughed Tom, giving his chum a playful push. \"But seriously, I'm mighty\r\nwell pleased with this stuff; it turned out better than I dared hope.\r\nYou know, I got the idea for bendable glass while I was trying to figure\r\nout a way to make a huge telescope mirror. That was before we found the\r\nmeteorite.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I suppose you'll go back to the glass mirror if you can't find\r\nthe big stone so you can make the large green disk.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'm Well Pleased With This.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's what I'll have to do if the salvage attempt fails. But I'm\r\nsure we'll succeed.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Britten had been given a room at the Swift home. When the boys\r\ngot there they found their guest and Tom's father deep in a game of\r\nchess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Two Men Were Playing Chess]\r\n\r\n\"Well, son,\" laughed Mr. Swift, \"I've met my match at last. John Britten\r\nhas beaten me three straight games! But don't tell Damon about it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't, Dad,\" grinned Tom. \"What do you think of this?\" He handed his\r\nfather the bar of bendable glass.\r\n\r\n\"What do I think of it? Why, it looks like a glass rod, that's all I can\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then watch!\" Tom took the bar and deftly twisted it into the shape of a\r\nfat pretzel.\r\n\r\n\"You've done it, son!\" cried Mr. Swift. \"And to think I told you such\r\na thing was impossible! Congratulations!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"What Do You Think of This?\"]\r\n\r\nAt dinner that evening the conversation turned mainly to the projected\r\nflight to the West Indies. It was decided to start the next day at\r\nsunrise, as Captain Britten had received word from Florida that his\r\nbarge had been made ready. A tug was getting up steam to haul it to the\r\nCuban coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Congratulations!\" Cried Mr. Swift]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Damon can't go with us, Dad,\" said Tom. \"His wife won't let him! By\r\nthe way,\" he added with a laugh, \"she was looking up the names of all\r\nhis relatives--Mr. Damon said she was glad of the excuse to do so!--but\r\nshe could find none named Jones or Brown. So that definitely proves\r\nthose two fellows were fakes and that they merely pretended relationship\r\nin order to pump him about my work.\"\r\n\r\nAfter supper Ned went to his home to pack a suitcase, for he was to\r\nspend the night at the Swifts' to be on hand for the early start that\r\nwas being planned. Tom spent the evening in his office studying the\r\nlatest available data on diving operations, and plotting the route over\r\nwhich the party would travel to the coast of Cuba.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Packed His Suitcase]\r\n\r\nImmersed in his work, he at first paid but little attention to a\r\npeculiar odor that gradually was pervading the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized that something was wrong; a strange buzzing filled\r\nhis ears and the lights seemed to be growing dim. He started to get\r\nup, but instead fell across his desk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Something Was Wrong]\r\n\r\nAs Tom lay there motionless, a window opened noiselessly. Stealthily a\r\nmasked figure climbed in. After a hasty glance around the room, the\r\nintruder hastened to the desk and leaned over the unconscious youth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Masked Figure Entered]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDEEP SEA DIVING\r\n\r\n\r\nSwiftly the masked man took a bunch of keys from Tom's pocket. With a\r\ndirectness that indicated familiarity with the place, he went straight\r\nto the rug covering the entrance to the secret vault. Throwing this\r\naside, he unlocked the trap door and quietly raised it. The\r\ncombination lock, which gave warning if tampered with, had not been set\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Unlocked the Trap Door]\r\n\r\nNow the intruder very carefully draped the rug over the door in such a\r\nway that it would spread itself as before when the trap should be closed\r\nfrom below. Two minutes later Tom was alone in the office, which\r\nappeared exactly as it had before he was rendered unconscious. Yet there\r\ncrouched in the vault a hidden spy whose purpose was as sinister as his\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Draped the Rug Over the Door]\r\n\r\n\"Mist' Swift, Massa Tom ain' come back fum de office yit,\" announced Rad\r\nSampson as he placed the elderly inventor's nightly glass of hot milk on\r\nthe library table. \"I wuz jest up t' his room to ax him suffin' an' he\r\nwuzn't dar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess the boy is working a bit late tonight. But you sound a\r\ntrifle anxious, Eradicate. Do you think anything is wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh--Oh, no suh. No suh,\" mumbled the old Negro. \"I jest wondered ef\r\nyo'd seen him. Good night, suh! Good night!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Massa Tom Ain' Back Fum de Office.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Good night, Rad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mustn't worry ole Mist' Swift,\" the servant muttered to himself as he\r\nshuffled back to the kitchen. \"But Massa Tom tole me hisself he gwine t'\r\nbaid early 'cause he gotta git up befo' sunrise.\r\n\r\n\"Look hyah, Koku,\" he went on when he got to the kitchen. \"Quit stuffin'\r\ndat 'ar pie an' go out an' see ef Massa Tom all right. He ought t' have\r\nbin in de house long sence. I'se skeered mebbe some villains mought've\r\ncotched him!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"See Ef Massa Tom All Right.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Whoo!\" growled the giant, jumping up so quickly that his big,\r\nspecially-built chair crashed over. \"Where um war-club? Me fixum!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doan make sich a racket, yo' big lummox! Yo' want to skeer ol' Mist'\r\nSwift? Heah, take mah rollin'-pin.\"\r\n\r\nClutching the rolling pin as a \"war-club,\" Koku started through the\r\ndarkness toward Tom's private laboratory. Following him at a discreet\r\ndistance came old Rad Sampson, who had armed himself with a big\r\nbutcher knife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rad Followed]\r\n\r\n\"Dar's a light in de office, big boy,\" whispered the Negro. \"Be keerful,\r\nnow!\"\r\n\r\nThe giant merely grunted, crept up to the window and peered within. His\r\ngreat height enabled him to do so easily. \"Come,\" he said finally,\r\nturning toward the door. \"We go in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whut de matter?\" demanded Eradicate, struggling to keep up with his\r\ncompanion. \"Am suffin' wrong? Mah goodness!\" he cried a moment later\r\nin the office. \"Po' Massa Tom done been killed! Look at him a-layin'\r\ndere!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Giant Peered in the Window]\r\n\r\n\"Him no dead!\" rumbled Koku, leaning over his master. \"Him heart still\r\nbeatum. Him need fresh air.\" Gently he picked Tom up and carried him\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"I'll git a doctah!\" exclaimed the old colored man. \"Dey's a phone in\r\nheah.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Him No Dead!\" Rumbled Koku]\r\n\r\nBefore the physician could be reached, the beneficial effects of the\r\ncool night air had brought the young inventor back to consciousness. At\r\nfirst he could not recall what had happened and was not a little\r\nastonished to find himself lying on the grass.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is the matter, Koku?\" he demanded, pressing his hand\r\nto his aching head. \"What am I doing out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master out, get knockum,\" said the giant. \"We find you on desk. Rad\r\ncallum medicine man now.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"What Am I Doing Here?\"]\r\n\r\n\"A doctor? No, I'm all right. Tell him to cancel the call.\" Tom\r\nmanaged to struggle to his feet. \"I remember now! Some kind of gas must\r\nhave been used on me. But I must see to the office. Maybe I've been\r\nrobbed.\"\r\n\r\nLeaning heavily on the giant's arm, Tom walked as fast as he could into\r\nthe laboratory. At first glance everything seemed to be in order, and to\r\nhis relief he found the vault was locked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Vault Was Locked]\r\n\r\nThe young inventor did not know that a key was missing from his ring,\r\nnor, as he twirled the dial of the combination-lock, did he realize that\r\na slender lever had been severed from below, thus rendering useless the\r\nintricate mechanism.\r\n\r\n\"Who done dis to you', Massa Tom?\" asked Rad.\r\n\r\n\"Wish I knew. Anyhow, there's been no damage done except to me! My\r\nhead's splitting, so I must get to bed. Koku, stay on guard here from\r\nnow on until I return from Cuba. And get several of the men to relieve\r\nyou. Another thing: I don't want either of you to mention this affair to\r\nanyone. Dad would hear about it and worry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Koku, Stay on Guard Here.\"]\r\n\r\n\"If I catchum fella I breakum in little bits!\" cried Koku fiercely. He\r\nshook the rolling-pin vigorously. \"Better him stay 'way fum me!\"\r\n\r\nTom awoke the next morning little the worse for his experience. Thanks\r\nto a rugged constitution, he had been able to throw off the ill effects\r\nof the poisonous fumes which had overcome him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Better Him Stay 'Way Fum Me!\"]\r\n\r\n\"I can't make it out, Ned,\" he said as the boys stood watching the\r\nmechanics warm up the engines of the big seaplane. \"Nothing is missing.\r\nWhoever did the job didn't even rob me, and I had a good deal of cash in\r\nmy wallet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe nobody made an attempt on you or your property at all, Tom,\" Ned\r\nremarked slowly.\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean? I certainly was knocked out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I know that. But couldn't some sort of gas have seeped into your\r\noffice from your adjoining laboratory? A bottle of acid might have\r\ncracked, or--\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Mechanics Warmed up the Engines]\r\n\r\n\"Nothing like that happened. I'm positive, because the same thought\r\nstruck me. I made a careful inspection this morning. Everything was in\r\nperfect order.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly is strange,\" said Ned. \"It looks as if some enemy is\r\ncamping on your trail, Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll have a hard time picking up that same trail in a few minutes,\"\r\nchuckled the inventor. \"Here come Captain Britten and Dad. I guess we\r\ncan take off soon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A Bottle of Acid Might Have Cracked.\"]\r\n\r\n\"So your sea-goin' air-yacht is ready to cast off, is she?\" asked the\r\nold diver. \"Well, when ye haul in the gangplank, so to speak, I'll be\r\naboard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care of yourself, son,\" said Barton Swift, shaking Tom's hand. \"I\r\nhope you will be successful in your attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, Dad. And thanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doan git et up by no sharks or allygators!\" cautioned Rad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Take Care of Yourself, Son.\"]\r\n\r\nThe mechanics had finished their work and were seen climbing down from\r\nthe fuselage. The passengers took their places in the roomy cabin while\r\nTom seated himself behind the controls.\r\n\r\nAfter running a critical eye over the score of instruments he reached\r\nfor the throttle and clutched the wheel tighter. The intermittent\r\ncoughing of the powerful motors changed to a deafening roar, and the\r\nhuge ship lumbered off down the long field, gathering speed every\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Sat Behind the Controls]\r\n\r\n\"We're off!\" cried Ned, waving at the already distant figures left\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"And we'll bring home the meteorite!\" muttered Tom to himself as the\r\n\"Winged Arrow\" glided smoothly toward the clouds lining the southern\r\nhorizon. \"For I'm going to make the most wonderful telescope the world\r\nhas ever known!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We're off!\" Cried Ned]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTRAPPED BY A SEA MONSTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This is travelin' in style, all right,\" approvingly remarked Captain\r\nBritten, looking about the comfortably appointed cabin and sniffing the\r\nappetizing odor of lamb chops on the electric grill. When necessary, Ned\r\nNewton could cook an impromptu meal. He really was rather proud of his\r\nability.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Cooked Some Lamb Chops]\r\n\r\nAs the amateur chef placed the meal on a small, collapsible table, Tom\r\nannounced that they were now flying over the state of Georgia. \"We\r\nshould reach Key West about three P.M.,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe ship droned steadily onward. At two o'clock in the afternoon they\r\nwere passing near a large city. \"Miami,\" declared Ned, who had been\r\nporing over a chart. \"Airplanes go to many parts of South America from\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Miami,\" Declared Ned]\r\n\r\nTom sent the \"Winged Arrow\" lower and lower. Finally he leveled off at\r\nan altitude of about five hundred feet above the blue sea. Here the full\r\nforce of the fierce subtropical sun began to make itself felt.\r\n\r\nThe travelers, fresh from the comparatively cool northern summer, made\r\nhaste to open all the air vents in the plane. Then they changed into\r\nwhite linen suits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Changed into Linen Suits]\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Tom, mopping his brow. \"I've traveled in the jungles\r\nof Africa but have never felt hotter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it's the ship, my boy. You see, the dark metal hull fairly soaks up\r\nthe sun, an' that's why we're a bit uncomfortable,\" said Captain\r\nBritten. \"Once we land, you'll think the climate fine!\"\r\n\r\nShortly afterward they flew over a grim-looking American battleship. It\r\ngreeted them with a hoarse blast of her whistle as the flying boat shot\r\nby at the rate of two hundred miles an hour. On either side tiny\r\nislands, or cays, appeared, then vanished as if by magic. Finally a blue\r\nblur straight ahead began to loom even larger, and in a few minutes the\r\n\"Winged Arrow\" landed in the harbor of Key West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Flew Over a Battleship]\r\n\r\n\"Half-past three,\" said Tom, glancing at the clock on the instrument\r\npanel. \"A slow passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fast as I'd want to make it,\" declared Captain Britten. \"A steamer'd\r\nhave taken a good many hours where we needed only minutes. There's the\r\nold 'Betsy B.' tied to her pier, so let's get over to her!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In the Harbor at Key West]\r\n\r\nThe idling engines were speeded up and the flying boat moved slowly\r\nacross the harbor. A tug with smoke curling from her single thick funnel\r\nlay near the broad-beamed barge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Tug Lay Near the Barge]\r\n\r\nOver the stern of the latter several grinning Negroes leaned. Their\r\nancestors might have been stricken dumb at sight of the great sky craft\r\ntying up to their ship, but these darkies were familiar with daily\r\npassage of planes bound for South America and showed but little\r\nastonishment. In a liquid Spanish-English patois they bade the whites\r\nwelcome. All of them were old retainers of Captain Britten.\r\n\r\nAs the elderly man had said, the old barge had served as winter quarters\r\nfor him during the past years. In consequence, he had had her little\r\ncabins fitted up more luxuriously than is customary on such vessels.\r\nTom and Ned were given one far more comfortable than they had expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cabins Were Comfortable]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the afternoon was taken up with inspection of the ship, the\r\narrangements for the safe-keeping of the \"Winged Arrow,\" and the laying\r\nof plans. Immediately after the hydroplane had been moored to a small\r\npier owned by Captain Britten, the tug-boat chugged out into the Gulf of\r\nMexico at the rate of ten knots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tug Chugged out into the Gulf]\r\n\r\n\"I'd say we should reach the spot some time tomorrow afternoon,\" said\r\nTom after studying the chart. \"It's just under two hundred miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we'll get your meteorite for you!\" predicted the old salvage man\r\nconfidently. \"Lucky the captain of that freighter 'Perry' took a bearing\r\non the lighthouse at Port Baracoa; otherwise it would be like lookin'\r\nfor a boll weevil in a bale o' cotton!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Studied the Charts]\r\n\r\nRuiz, the coal-black cook, served a good supper at sundown. Shortly\r\nafterward the boys went to their bunks, for both were tired after the\r\nlong flight. Then too, Tom was still feeling the effects of the gas\r\ninhaled the previous night.\r\n\r\nNext morning found the \"Betsy B.\" wallowing through a smooth sea a few\r\nmiles off the east coast of Cuba. Under the supervision of Captain\r\nBritten, several of the crew were busy oiling the huge winch,\r\noverhauling steel cables, and seeing to a dozen other minor but\r\nimportant details. Altogether, it was a busy scene that met the eyes\r\nof Tom and Ned when they emerged on deck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Crew Was Busy]\r\n\r\n\"Your father was right, I think,\" said Ned. \"You certainly have a\r\ncompetent man. See how the crew jump at his word!\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree,\" said Tom with satisfaction. \"But me for breakfast! This sea\r\nair surely gives a fellow a good appetite.\"\r\n\r\nA head wind coupled with a rising sea combined to hold back the tug and\r\nher rather clumsy tow as the day waned. Occasional heavy rain squalls\r\nmade the deck of the barge a rather uncomfortable place, so the boys\r\nstayed in the main cabin and discussed plans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Head Winds Held Back the Tug]\r\n\r\n\"I think the rainy season must be at its height,\" groaned Ned at last as\r\nhe and Tom sat sweltering. \"Maybe we'll be cooped up here for the whole\r\nvoyage.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rain Kept the Boys in Their Cabins]\r\n\r\n\"Not me,\" declared the young inventor with a laugh. \"Since when have you\r\ngrown afraid of a little rain? By afternoon we ought to be near the\r\nspot where Captain Mawson jettisoned the meteorite and then we'll begin\r\nto get busy, weather or no weather!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope the thing will be worth all our trouble,\" said Ned a bit\r\ncrossly. \"Perhaps we won't even be able to find it. What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're just suffering from a touch of 'mal de mer'!\" teased Tom,\r\nrefusing to consider his chum's gloomy remarks.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a bit seasick!\" protested Ned indignantly. \"I just think\r\nwe're on a wild goose chase, that's all!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'm Not Seasick,\" Protested Ned]\r\n\r\n\"Wait and see.\"\r\n\r\nEvening drew nigh, and the sudden tropical night fell. On the Cuban\r\ncoast lights went on, dominated by the intermittent glare of a powerful\r\nbeacon many miles ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Baracoa Light,\" announced Captain Britten, seeing this. \"We will lay\r\noff-shore till morning and begin our work tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Captain Pointed to the Beacon]\r\n\r\nIt spoke well for Tom Swift's nerves that he slept soundly, despite\r\nhis great interest in the morrow's activities. During the night the sea\r\nabated and the rain ceased. Dawn broke with a brilliance to be seen only\r\nin tropical lands.\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the spot in the sea beneath which the meteorite lay,\r\nit was necessary to get the barge into a position corresponding to the\r\napex of an isosceles triangle in relation to the lighthouse tower and\r\nthe peak of a small hill near by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Made Some Observations]\r\n\r\nCaptain Britten and Tom, sextants in hand, made repeated observations.\r\nNed stood by the telephone connecting the tug and her tow, transmitting\r\nto the former's captain the navigation directions. Finally the barge was\r\nsupposed to be exactly where the freighter had thrown overboard the big\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n\"We may have to look around a little, though,\" remarked Tom as Captain\r\nBritten ordered the tug halted and anchors lowered. \"In the big storm\r\nCaptain Mawson might have made a mistake in his reckoning.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chart Showed the Depth of the Water]\r\n\r\nThe water was about three hundred feet deep here, the Hydrographic\r\nOffice charts showed. When Ned learned this, he looked serious.\r\n\r\n\"The record depth attained by a diver is only 204 feet!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"At least, that's what I read in an encyclopedia.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess you're referring to James Hooper, who reached that depth off the\r\nSouth American coast some years ago,\" smiled Tom Swift. \"But since\r\nthen diving-dress has undergone considerable improvement, eh, Captain\r\nBritten?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Boom Was Swung Overside]\r\n\r\n\"That's right. I have on board several of the newest type suits.\r\nBesides, I use native divers, men who, even without protection, can\r\ndescend to almost unbelievable distances.\"\r\n\r\nQuickly a boom was swung out overside. From it hung several pulleys to\r\nwhich was attached a narrow steel platform. Presently three tall\r\nNegroes carried out of the storeroom grotesque-looking diving suits\r\nwhich weighed over two hundred and fifty pounds apiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Shuffled Across the Deck]\r\n\r\nCaptain Britten spoke in Spanish to one of them, then the fellow began\r\nputting on the weird uniform. It made him look like a visitor from\r\nanother world. The tremendous weight of his garb prevented him from\r\nmoving at more than a slow shuffle across the deck, strong though he\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Trail of Bubbles]\r\n\r\nA section of the railing had been removed to allow access to the\r\ndangling metal platform upon which the diver stepped. The boom swung out\r\nand the drum of the winch began unrolling. In a few seconds only a trail\r\nof vanishing bubbles marked the spot where the Negro had gone into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take him to reach bottom?\" asked Ned, peering overside\r\nin fascination.\r\n\r\n\"About forty minutes,\" replied Captain Britten. \"A diver must be\r\nlowered and raised gradually in order to avoid the terrible\r\nafter-effects of a sudden change in pressure. At three hundred feet the\r\npressure is more than eighteen thousand pounds per square foot!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Held His Watch to His Ear]\r\n\r\nTime dragged on. Down, down rolled the heavy cable supporting the diver.\r\nFinally Tom held his watch to his ear, as though he were afraid it might\r\nhave stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's still running,\" laughed Ned a little nervously as he observed\r\nhis chum's action. \"Only five more minutes, Tom!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Reported a Good Sandy Bottom]\r\n\r\nAt last a bell tinkled and Captain Britten grabbed up the telephone\r\ninstrument which connected barge and diver. For a few seconds he\r\nlistened, then replied briefly in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Alvarez is down,\" he said to Tom as he hung up the receiver. \"He\r\nreports a good, sandy bottom but no sight yet of the meteorite. At any\r\nrate, there's no danger of it having sunk in an oozy bottom.\"\r\n\r\nTen minutes later the phone buzzed again, this time with a request\r\nthat the ship be moved a little east and that Manuel, Alvarez's mate, be\r\nsent down to help. This was done, and another telephone instrument was\r\nplugged in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manuel Was to Go Down]\r\n\r\nTom, who understood a little Spanish, stood by to hear the report of the\r\nsecond diver. Both lines were now kept open continuously.\r\n\r\nFinally Manuel reached bottom, saying that he had contacted Alvarez. For\r\nsome minutes nothing came through either telephone but the sound of\r\nthe submerged men's breathing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Something Has Gone Wrong!]\r\n\r\n\"I see something, Señor! A rock--'que grande'!\" came to Tom's ears\r\nsuddenly. \"It must indeed be that which the Señor seeks. But, Santa\r\nMaria! there is something else--!\" Manuel's voice broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Britten! Can you hear your man?\" shouted Tom after his repeated\r\nattempts to renew, the connection had failed.\r\n\r\n\"No! I can hear only a muffled groaning. Something has gone wrong.\r\nThat's sure!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Stop, Señor!\" Screamed the Engineer]\r\n\r\n\"Pull 'em up quick, then!\" advised Ned.\r\n\r\nThis seemed good advice, so the auxiliary engine was started and the\r\nwinches began turning slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Señor!\" suddenly screamed the native engineer, waving his arms\r\nexcitedly and cutting off the steam. \"The drums turn--si--but the cables\r\ndo not rise. Something has caught the men!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loose the Winches]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA ROBBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Loose the winches a little!\" ordered Captain Britten sharply. \"The\r\nair-hoses are strained almost to the breaking point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Si,\" mumbled the engineer, easing off the brake a trifle.\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble, in your opinion, Captain?\" asked Tom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Engineer Eased the Brake]\r\n\r\n\"Hard to say, young fellow,\" came the worried reply. \"What I'm afraid of\r\nis that a huge octopus or some such monster has attacked the poor\r\ndivers. Whatever it is, I fear it's the end for 'em, as there's not\r\nanother diver aboard and we can't haul the men up for fear of breakin'\r\ntheir air-lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you another diving suit?\" asked Tom rapidly. \"I've had\r\nconsiderable experience in undersea work and can't let those boys drown\r\nwithout trying to help 'em!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'm Afraid It Is an Octopus!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Can you do it, lad? Yes, I've a brand-new outfit aboard that's of the\r\nlatest type. But what'll I say to your father if anything happens to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad wouldn't want me to stand back at a time like this,\" rejoined the\r\nyoung inventor. \"I sent these men down and it's up to me to see they get\r\nback safely!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Tom!\" cried Ned. \"What of the octopus? You may be trapped too, and\r\nnot save Manuel and Alvarez either!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"It's up to Me!\"]\r\n\r\n\"You forget, or maybe you didn't know, that I brought my electric rifle\r\nwith me. That'll polish off any devil-fish I'm likely to meet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least let me go too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't but one suit,\" said Captain Britten. \"Now, Tom Swift, if you're\r\nready, here's the suit.\"\r\n\r\n\"All set,\" said the young inventor calmly. He began to remove his outer\r\nclothing. \"Ned, please bring up my rifle.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the young scientist had been helped into the massively\r\narmored suit, Ned was back on deck carrying a peculiar-looking gun.\r\nUnlike other weapons, this one could discharge a bolt of electricity\r\nwhich would slay the largest animal or merely tickle a baby, according\r\nto the adjustment. Tom set it to its highest power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Helped Tom into the Suit]\r\n\r\n\"Good luck!\" cried Ned as the heavy helmet was lowered into place.\r\n\r\nTom attempted to wave in reply but the gear was too weighty. Later, when\r\nhe got into the depths, the buoyant effect of the water would enable\r\nhim to move more freely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Carried a Peculiar Gun]\r\n\r\nClutching his gun in his armored hand, Tom crept slowly on to the\r\nplatform suspended over the sea. As it was lowered to the water he got a\r\nlast glimpse of Ned Newton's face staring down at him.\r\n\r\nThe young business manager paced the deck of the barge, at every step\r\nreproaching himself for allowing his chum to undertake so hazardous a\r\nventure. As his watch told him that Tom must be nearing the bottom he\r\nseated himself by the switchboard, headphones clamped over his ears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Crept Slowly to the Platform]\r\n\r\n\"Ground floor,\" announced Tom at last. \"Pretty dark down here. I'll\r\nswitch on my flash. Now--by George!\"\r\n\r\nNed heard a muffled silence.\r\n\r\n\"Tom! Tom!\" he shouted frantically. \"What's happened? Are you all\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly ten minutes Ned crouched by the instrument trying to get in\r\ntouch with his friend. Just as he was giving up hope he heard a weak\r\nvoice gasp:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Ground Floor,\" Announced Tom]\r\n\r\n\"Not so loud, old man! You've nearly broken my ear-drums. Everything's\r\nunder control!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurray!\" shouted Ned. \"He's found 'em, Captain Britten!\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy!\" protested Tom from the depths. \"Don't shout like that so near\r\nthe phone! Yes, the men are O.K. A big fish had 'em--don't know what it\r\nwas, as I never heard of anything like it. But a couple of shots from\r\nthe rifle killed it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A Big Fish Had 'Em!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Tell Captain Britten to send down some heavy chains. We've found the\r\nmeteorite!\"\r\n\r\nThe now jubilant crew, who had feared their companions lost, scurried\r\nabout. In a few minutes the stout chain was snaking its way down through\r\nthe blue-green ocean.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me they're taking a mighty long time about it,\" said Ned to\r\nCaptain Britten after an hour had passed with no word from the three\r\ndivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Chain Snaked Its Way Down]\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" agreed the other. \"Working at that depth it's decidedly\r\nunsafe to stay below so long. I'll warn Tom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't be done!\" was that young man's decisive answer to the old salvage\r\nexpert's warning. \"This is a tougher job than I thought, for the bottom\r\nof the stone seems to be sinking slowly. If we can't finish our job now\r\nI'm afraid we'll lose our prize. But don't worry. We ought to be through\r\nin another twenty minutes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"This Is a Tough Job.\"]\r\n\r\nThe twenty minutes passed, and another like period was nearly run\r\nthrough before Tom announced himself and the other two ready to come to\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the dreaded \"bends,\" an affliction suffered by divers drawn to\r\nthe surface too rapidly, they made their ascent as slowly as their\r\ndescent. Thus it was that the great meteorite reached the top long\r\nbefore Tom and the two natives did.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Made Their Ascent Slowly]\r\n\r\n\"What in the name o' tarnation did he want with that?\" demanded\r\nCaptain Britten as the giant stone was lowered cautiously to the deck.\r\nWeighing many tons, it had tilted the barge far over to one side as the\r\npowerful derrick drew it up. \"It looks like some old rock a man might\r\npick up 'most any place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom Swift usually has a good reason for everything he does,\" smiled\r\nNed noncommittally. \"I'm no scientist, but he is, so perhaps he wants to\r\nexperiment with this stone from another planet.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Powerful Derrick Drew It Up]\r\n\r\nAt last the three divers reached the surface and were hauled rapidly\r\nup to the deck of the barge. All of them appeared exhausted, but Tom's\r\neyes expressed the greatest satisfaction when he saw the meteorite\r\nsafely aboard.\r\n\r\nAt his request the tug was put under way and the \"Betsy B.\" started back\r\nto her home port in Key West. During the trip Tom managed to cut from\r\nthe meteorite a fifty-pound chunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Cut off a Large Chunk]\r\n\r\n\"I'm very eager to see if this stone contains more X,\" he explained to\r\nNed, \"so I'm planning to fly straight home with this sample to analyze\r\nit. I want you to put the rest of the meteorite on a fast freight train\r\nand travel north with it.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting when the dock at Key West was reached. Tom waited no\r\nlonger than was necessary to take on a supply of gasoline for the\r\n\"Winged Arrow.\" He paid Captain Britten a generous fee and added a bonus\r\nfor the divers who had helped him. Then with a hasty good-bye the\r\nexcited young inventor roared off in the gathering darkness toward his\r\ndistant home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Paid Captain Britten]\r\n\r\nAfter an uneventful flight he reached Shopton at about half-past one the\r\nfollowing morning. The wheels of the plane had barely stopped turning\r\nwhen the tall figure of Koku came rushing out of the shadows of the\r\nhangar to greet his master.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Koku Came Rushing Out]\r\n\r\n\"You're right on the job!\" exclaimed Tom, climbing stiffly from the\r\ncabin. \"How is everything?\"\r\n\r\n\"All thing good!\" declared the giant, grinning to see the young inventor\r\nback. \"Catchum skystone?\"\r\n\r\n\"We caught it, all right. You might tote this sample of it over to the\r\nlab.\" Tom handed his servant the segment he had chiseled from the main\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n\"Master knows 'bout secret cave under lab'tory?\" questioned the giant as\r\nthe two walked across the field in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Tote This Sample to the Lab.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Cave? Oh, you mean the vault?\" asked Tom, who had been thinking of\r\nother matters.\r\n\r\n\"Night you go 'way in sky-bird, Koku watch. Koku hear bell go\r\nting-ting-ting!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tom was paying strict attention.\r\n\r\n\"Great Scott! D'you mean to say someone broke into my Chest of Secrets?\r\nTell me about it quickly!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Paid Strict Attention]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSUCCESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Me tell!\" said Koku. \"Hear bell, know bad mans hide in cave. I creep up\r\nan' watch!\" His dramatic pause might have seemed funny at any other time\r\nbut Tom was badly worried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Swift Was Worried]\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up!\" commanded the young inventor sharply, grabbing the giant's\r\narm. \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing happen US,\" answered Koku. \"Plenty happen HIM! I catchum fella,\r\ncrawl up fum cave, knockum out, callum policemans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good boy! You rate a new suit for that. You can tell the tailor to make\r\nit as loud as you like!\"\r\n\r\nNothing could have pleased the simple giant more, for he loved to dress\r\nup in gaudy clothes, a trait left over from his savage life before the\r\nyoung inventor had brought him to America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I Catchum Fella!\"]\r\n\r\nToo excited to sleep, Tom Swift went straight to his office and called\r\nthe police station. The desk sergeant verified what Koku had said and\r\nasked the young scientist to come down and prefer charges.\r\n\r\nAs he was about to leave he saw on top of his accumulated mail a letter\r\nfrom the Apex Glass Works. It was from Mr. Stern. The man advised Tom\r\nthat he suspected two discharged workmen as the pair who had attempted\r\nto rob him. Photographs were enclosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photographs Were Enclosed]\r\n\r\n\"That he, Master!\" suddenly boomed Koku, who had been gazing at the\r\nphotos. \"That man steal green glass thing I ketch back!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, I believe you're right!\" declared Tom. \"This picture most\r\ncertainly resembles the fellow you dragged in here. Come on, you and I\r\nwill go over to the jail and check up.\"\r\n\r\nLate as the hour was, the two took out a car and hastened over to the\r\ncounty prison. No sooner had the sleepy officer on duty conducted them\r\nback to the prisoner's cell than Tom immediately recognized the man as\r\nthe one Koku had captured with the green disk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They Drove to the County Prison]\r\n\r\nEager to get off as lightly as possible, the fellow, who had been a\r\nconfidential clerk in the main offices of the glass works, made a full\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\n\"It was Hammer who got me into this, Mr. Swift,\" whined Anton. \"He\r\noverheard Mr. Stern talking about your experiments with bendable\r\nglass. He said you'd surely succeed and that the invention would be\r\nworth a fortune. So we decided to steal your formula. I've got a sick\r\nwife, Mr. Swift--\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hammer Overheard Mr. Stern]\r\n\r\n\"A pack of lies!\" roughly interrupted the policeman. \"He's a single man,\r\nMr. Swift, and has a police record to boot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, hold him. And I hope you will catch his confederate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry. The boys'll bring him in!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"He Has a Police Record.\"]\r\n\r\nAlthough the hour was late, Tom decided to return to the laboratory\r\nand inspect the vault. There had been a certain sly expression in\r\nAnton's eyes which had vaguely disturbed the inventor. It was as if the\r\nman were holding something back and grinning over it.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes Tom's feeling was proven correct, for the formula\r\ndealing with the flexible glass was gone! Koku, when questioned,\r\nadmitted that he had seen some papers drop from Anton's pocket when he\r\nhad seized him just outside the laboratory, but the simple giant had\r\npaid no attention to them. There followed a frantic search with a\r\nflashlight by Tom but there was no trace of the missing documents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Formula Was Gone]\r\n\r\n\"They couldn't have blown away!\" he declared. \"They were clipped\r\ntogether by a special heavy binder. Somebody must have picked them up!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Made a Frantic Search]\r\n\r\nWhen Tom visited Anton in jail the next day, the fellow denied loudly\r\nthat he had taken anything. The police promised to redouble their\r\nefforts to capture Hammer. With that assurance the inventor was forced\r\nto content himself.\r\n\r\nThe next few days Tom was so busy that he gave only an occasional\r\nthought to his loss. Analysis of the sample cut from the meteorite\r\nshowed that it was even richer than he had hoped in the new substance,\r\nX. Immediately he telegraphed a large science supply house for huge\r\nflasks, beakers, retorts and other paraphernalia necessary to extract\r\nand refine the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sample Was Rich in X]\r\n\r\nThis done, he arranged for the loan of a large refracting telescope from\r\na near-by observatory to be used in conjunction with the big green disk\r\nhe proposed to make. Professor Standish of the college was so interested\r\nin the project that Tom invited him to the forthcoming test.\r\n\r\nWork was begun on an improvised observatory to be erected on a mountain\r\nin the Adirondacks. This would place the telescope above most of the\r\nblurring effects of the dense, lower atmosphere, filled as it is with\r\nsmoke and dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Work Was Begun on the Observatory]\r\n\r\nNed Newton wired that the meteorite had been safely placed on a fast\r\nfreight train. He added that he was traveling in the caboose of the same\r\ntrain by special arrangement with the road officials. Tom met his chum\r\nat the station.\r\n\r\n\"How do you like riding in style?\" he teased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ned Traveled in the Caboose]\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" grunted Ned. \"I'll take a plane next time.\"\r\n\r\nA huge truck transported the planet stone to the shops of the Swift\r\nConstruction Company. One of the buildings had been cleared of all other\r\nwork, and in it a very large furnace had been erected to cast the green\r\ndisk. Powerful mechanisms crushed the meteorite to a fine powder which\r\nwas dissolved by strong acids, then separated into its various\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Meteorite Was Crushed]\r\n\r\n\"The furnace will have to be enlarged!\" declared Tom. \"I had planned\r\nto make a disk twenty feet long but there is so much X that we can\r\neasily make it thirty-five feet. There'll still be several hundred\r\npounds left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not use it all and make the biggest 'scope you can?\" suggested Ned\r\nNewton.\r\n\r\n\"I believe this will be large enough. Besides, I have an idea that the X\r\nhas other and even more remarkable powers. I don't want to use it all up\r\nin this device.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We Can Make a Larger Disk!\"]\r\n\r\nA gang of men had been employed to clear a trail up the side of the\r\nmountain in the Adirondacks and construct a road to the summit as none\r\never had been made to the spot Tom intended to use. A specially large\r\nmotor truck was built to carry first the telescope, then the giant green\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\nIt may well be supposed that all these preparations ran into money. Many\r\na groan did Ned give when he studied the mounting cost sheets. Tom,\r\nhowever, was deaf to all his chum's protestations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Special Truck Was Built]\r\n\r\n\"I had hoped your new bendable glass would more than repay the cost of\r\nyour telescope,\" grumbled Ned. \"That's gone, and it looks to me as\r\nthough everything else'll go too. The Swift Construction Company will\r\nsoon be bankrupt, Tom Swift, if you don't slow down!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, my flexible glass is gone? Why, I've had an\r\napplication on file in the Patent Office for several months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, for Pete's sake, why didn't you tell me? Here I've been\r\nworrying my head off for nothing!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"You'll Be Bankrupt!\" Warned Ned]\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, old man. But you know I've had a lot on my mind. However, we\r\nmust get back the papers, for the thief can make things pretty\r\nuncomfortable if he chooses to.\"\r\n\r\nAs Tom had found out, X would be useful only in an absolutely pure\r\nstate. To refine it to the proper degree was a painfully slow process,\r\ntaking in this case a full six weeks. While his chemists labored away\r\nunder the young inventor's supervision, everything else had been made\r\nready. At last the new element was prepared. The tons of yellow powder\r\nwere dumped into the heated furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: His Chemists Worked Away]\r\n\r\nThree days later the stuff had cooled sufficiently for an inspection to\r\nbe made. A traveling crane slowly hoisted the massive iron lid of the\r\nelectric furnace. Tom climbed a ladder and peered down.\r\n\r\n\"It's perfect!\" he shouted a moment later. Mr. Damon and Barton Swift\r\nwere standing anxiously with Ned and the workmen to hear the verdict.\r\nAt the young inventor's words the group gave a cheer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Peered Down at the Disk]\r\n\r\n\"Bless my stars and planets!\" cried Mr. Damon, capering about like a\r\nboy. \"I can hardly wait till you have your big glass set up!\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be long now,\" promised Tom, much pleased himself.\r\n\r\nWhile the giant disk was being given a final electrical treatment, the\r\nyouthful inventor was called to the police station. The fugitive crook,\r\nHammer, had finally been nabbed, still with the formula for the\r\nbendable glass in his possession. Tom was glad to get this back, even\r\nthough patent proceedings were under way, for anyone holding the papers\r\ncould have instituted a costly legal contest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hammer Had Been Nabbed]\r\n\r\nAt last the time arrived when the great disk was wrapped in hundreds of\r\nbales of cotton, suspended on racks and loaded onto the great truck. Tom\r\ninsisted upon riding with his precious creation. The rest of his party,\r\nincluding his father, Ned Newton, Mr. Damon, Professor Standish, Koku\r\nand Rad, traveled by train to the foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Disk Was Loaded on the Truck]\r\n\r\n\"Massa Tom gonna look about six scrillion miles froo space,\" confided\r\nEradicate Sampson to Koku. The old Negro leaned heavily upon the massive\r\narm of his huge companion. \"He see wonderful things!\"\r\n\r\n\"He sure make big medicine!\" declared the giant, for once agreeing with\r\nhis old rival. He had only the vaguest idea about what his master was\r\nattempting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Koku and Rad Went Along]\r\n\r\nWhen the entire group assembled on top the mountain there was a sudden\r\nhush. The sun had set in a fiery glow that presaged a clear night, and\r\nnow darkness overtook the expectant onlookers.\r\n\r\nAt last Tom stepped to the giant telescope and adjusted it upon the\r\nplanet Mars. He electrified the immense disk, which glowed, then could\r\nnot be seen at all.\r\n\r\nLooking through the eyepiece, the young inventor stood as though\r\ntransfixed. One minute! Two!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tom Stepped to the Telescope]\r\n\r\n\"Tom! How does it work?\" asked Ned finally, unable to restrain himself\r\nany longer.\r\n\r\n\"Look for yourself!\" cried Tom, turning from the instrument. His face\r\nwore an expression of awe.\r\n\r\nNed quickly took his place.\r\n\r\n\"Marvelous!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBefore his eyes were revealed a great city, nearly seventy-five million\r\nmiles distant!\r\n\r\nPeculiar people surged along the avenues, weird aircraft thronged the\r\nupper atmosphere, and gigantic buildings and palaces dotted the place.\r\nAll on far-distant Mars!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He Saw a Gigantic City]\r\n\r\nAs each one in Tom's party saw the wonderful sight, he in turn\r\ncongratulated the youthful inventor in his own way. Ned grasped his\r\nchum's hand but could say nothing. Mr. Damon blessed the distant stars.\r\nKoku and Rad fell upon their knees. Into the eyes of Barton Swift came\r\ntears as he said:\r\n\r\n\"Tom, my son, you have performed the greatest miracle of the Age!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"You Have Performed a Miracle!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead These INTERESTING BOOKS Too!\r\n\r\nAirplanes!--War!--Superscience!\r\n\r\nTOM SWIFT and His Giant Telescope\r\n\r\nMANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN and the Midnight Monster\r\n\r\nMEN WITH WINGS: Thrilling Story of Flyers\r\n\r\nTAILSPIN TOMMY and the Sky Bandits\r\n\r\nCaptain Frank Hawks, Famous AIR ACE, and the League of Twelve\r\n\r\nPAT NELSON, Ace of Test Pilots\r\n\r\nMAC OF THE MARINES in War-Torn China\r\n\r\nBARNEY BAXTER in the Air With the Eagle Squadron\r\n\r\nBUCK ROGERS, 25th Century A.D., in the War With the Planet Venus\r\n\r\nFLASH GORDON in the Forest Kingdom of Mongo\r\n\r\nSKYROADS, with Clipper Williams of the Flying Legion\r\n\r\nDON WINSLOW of the Navy vs. the Scorpion Gang\r\n\r\nRead These THRILLING BOOKS Too!\r\n\r\nCowboys!--Indians!--Horses!\r\n\r\nTHE LONE RANGER and the Red Renegades (With Silver and Tonto)\r\n\r\nJARAGU, Indian Boy of the Jungle (Rex Beach)\r\n\r\nTIM McCOY on the Tomahawk Trail\r\n\r\nBUCK JONES in the Rock Creek Cattle War\r\n\r\nTOM MIX and the Hoard of Montezuma\r\n\r\nKEN MAYNARD in Western Justice\r\n\r\nBRONC PEELER, the Lone Cowboy\r\n\r\nFLAME BOY and the INDIANS' SECRET\r\n\r\nTEX THORNE Comes out of the West\r\n\r\nThe TEXAS KID\r\n\r\nGUNS in the Roaring West\r\n\r\nKING of the ROYAL MOUNTED Gets His Man (Zane Grey)\r\n\r\nRead These EXCITING BOOKS Too!\r\n\r\nMysteries!--Thrills!--Adventures!\r\n\r\nThe PHANTOM and the Sign of the Skull\r\n\r\nTERRY and the Pirates and the Giant's Vengeance\r\n\r\nJANE ARDEN and the Vanished Princess\r\n\r\nMYRA NORTH, Special Nurse, and Foreign Spies\r\n\r\nLittle ORPHAN ANNIE and the Mysterious Shoemaker\r\n\r\nTARZAN'S Revenge (Edgar Rice Burroughs)\r\n\r\nKAY DARCY and the Mystery Hideout\r\n\r\nBlaze Brandon With the FOREIGN LEGION\r\n\r\nLittle ANNIE ROONEY on the Highway to Adventure\r\n\r\nMARY LEE and the Indian Bead Mystery\r\n\r\nWASH TUBBS and Capt.
