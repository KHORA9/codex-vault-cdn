How far we may have\r\nsucceeded in this latter object, remains to be judged by others; we are\r\nhowever satisfied with having made the attempt, and we hope that abler\r\npencils than our own, may engage in the prosecution of this most desirable\r\nobject; for it is only by the publication of original matter, that a check\r\ncan be given to the increasing number of compilations and multiplied copies\r\nof \"ill-shaped\" figures, by which error is perpetuated, and science\r\nretarded.\r\n\r\nThe only original work that has appeared in this country similar to our\r\nown, is the Zoological Miscellany by Dr. Leach, which, as it was\r\ndiscontinued after the third volume, it may be presumed was unsuccessful:\r\nalthough little can be said of many of the figures in the early volumes,\r\nthose in the latter are much to be praised, and the whole are original; the\r\ndescriptions also abound with details highly interesting to the scientific\r\nworld, for which indeed the learned author principally intended it;\r\nnevertheless it is a question, whether science in the end would not have\r\nbeen equally, and perhaps more advanced, had this work been more adapted to\r\ngeneral readers. Instruction in these days of refinement must be made easy,\r\npalatable, and enticing; the eye must be pleased, while the understanding\r\nis improved, and Wisdom in her simple dignified garb will often be deserted\r\nfor Ignorance, decked out in the glittering trappings of Folly.\r\n\r\nThe _Naturalist's Miscellany_ conducted by Dr. Shaw, in its miscellaneous\r\nnature also resembled the present work, and reached to the extent of\r\ntwenty-four volumes. What an invaluable fund of information these might\r\nhave contained had their contents been original! Unfortunately, however,\r\nthe exceptions are so few, that the whole may be termed a loose\r\ncompilation, the descriptions being mostly given in as few words as\r\npossible, and the figures not only copied from wretched representations\r\nfound in old authors, but often coloured from their descriptions only! It\r\nis indeed lamentable that the Author, whose talents and abilities were\r\nunquestionable, should have exerted them so little, and thus have descended\r\nto the rank of a voluminous compiler, for little better can be said of the\r\nGeneral Zoology, begun and continued under his name: little original matter\r\ncan there be found, excepting in the latter volumes, yet even in these no\r\nnotice whatever is taken of the immense number of new species discovered in\r\nAfrica by Le Vaillant, and long ago published in the _Oiseaux d'Afrique_:\r\nthe engravings also are in like manner copied from old prints, enlarged or\r\ndiminished as occasion offers, without even a regard to the selection of\r\nthe best. It may be as well to observe in this place, that a great number\r\nof generic distinctions have been made in the two last volumes; which, as\r\nthey have not been followed by any of the great and acknowledged Zoologists\r\non the Continent, and appear to us in many instances trivial and\r\nunnecessary, will not be adopted in this work.\r\n\r\nIt will be unnecessary to point out with regard to the scientific\r\narrangement, that we have avowedly adopted the principles of the modern\r\nclassification; which the strict followers of Linnaeus (in this country\r\nalone) have so long, but so ineffectually opposed. The first has been\r\ndesignated as the natural, and the other the artificial system; and,\r\nwithout entering into a critical disquisition on these definitions, it will\r\nbe sufficient to observe, that by the Artificial System we bend nature to\r\nconform to certain arbitrary principles, which we lay down and to which we\r\ninsist all her productions known and unknown will conform; while in the\r\nNatural method, we endeavour by tracing her modifications, to adapt our\r\nsystem to that which appears to regulate her operations. In the one we give\r\nlaws, in the other receive them; by the first we are taught to believe that\r\nthe highest attainment of the science, is that of ascertaining the name of\r\nan object in our Museum, or of giving a new one; we record it in our\r\nfavourite system as a grammarian enters a new word in his dictionary, and\r\nthere the matter terminates. Where the artificial system ends, the natural\r\nbegins; for we then proceed to the investigation of affinities founded on\r\nanatomical construction, economy, and geographic distribution; our\r\nattention ceases to be confined to individuals, and extends to large\r\ngroups; general facts enable us to draw general conclusions, till the mind\r\nbegins faintly to discern a vast and mighty plan, by which the zones of the\r\nearth are peopled by their own respective races of animate beings; blending\r\ntheir confines unto each other with divine harmony, beauty, and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThat these inquiries and results have had a most wonderful effect on the\r\nnatural sciences of late years, is abundantly evident. Geology, a subject\r\nhardly thought of in this country a few years ago, is now found to be a\r\nscience of the first importance; with this, however, Conchology is so\r\nintimately connected, that without a certain knowledge of it, the geologist\r\nis frequently unable to prosecute inquiries of the most interesting nature;\r\nand there is little doubt but that Botany has been raised to the rank it\r\nnow so justly holds, solely because its natural system has been more\r\ngenerally studied and advocated in this country, than that of any other\r\nbranch of Natural History. In this science at least, we possess a\r\nsuperiority which our continental neighbours cannot dispute; and the name\r\nof Brown will be enrolled in the brightest page of our philosophic\r\ninquirers.\r\n\r\nThat the prejudiced adherence to the strict Linnaean system, has been the\r\nprimary cause why Zoology has been more neglected with us than on the\r\nContinent, will admit of little doubt; for by shutting the door to all\r\nfurther improvement, it has impressed the generality of our countrymen with\r\nan idea, that the highest object of the Naturalist was to label the\r\ncontents of a museum, and to arrange stuffed animals, like quaint patterns\r\nof old china, in glass cases: to thinking minds no less than to the vulgar,\r\nthis idea has produced a feeling of contempt and ridicule, and very few of\r\nthose qualified by nature for accurate investigation and philosophic\r\nreasoning, have been induced to make the science a study; and thus from\r\nsuch an unfortunate prejudice, to use the words of a powerful writer of the\r\npresent day, \"some future historian of the progress of human knowledge,\r\nwill have to state that England, till within the few last years, stood\r\nstill at the bottom of the steps where Linnaeus had left her; while her\r\nneighbours were advancing rapidly towards the entrance of the temple[1].\"\r\n\r\nFinally--Linnaeus to a comprehensive genius united indefatigable industry;\r\nyet he could not see and study those innumerable productions that have been\r\ndiscovered since his death: in proportion as our knowledge of objects\r\nincreases, so must our systems change, until the natural one is fully\r\ndeveloped; and the question simply comes to this, Whether the Linnaean\r\nmethod should be upheld as a solitary exception to the mutability of human\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nThe sun of truth must however finally prevail, and there is every reason to\r\nthink it has already broke, and will gradually disperse these mists of\r\nprejudice. It is however much to be regretted, that our public institutions\r\nare wholly inadequate to facilitate not only the advancement of students,\r\nbut the researches of those who are already engaged in prosecuting their\r\ninquiries: in Scotland alone are founded any Professorships of Natural\r\nHistory, and the establishment of our National Museum (in this branch only)\r\nis confessedly difficult: materials for study are more necessary in this\r\nscience than any other; yet the public Institutions and libraries of the\r\nmetropolis, \"rich and rare\" in every other department of knowledge, in most\r\ninstances are deficient in this of the most elementary books; setting aside\r\nthose of illustration, which, from being unavoidably expensive and within\r\nthe reach of few purchasers, are more particularly adapted for such general\r\nrepositories of learning. The protracted ill-health of its noble possessor,\r\nwas the cause no doubt of the Banksian magnificent library being left\r\ndeficient in several of the latest continental works; and that of the\r\nBritish Museum I have reason to think is still more defective. To the\r\nhonour however of the keepers of the Bodleian and Radcliffe Libraries, it\r\nshould be mentioned, that no pains or expense have been spared to render\r\nthem as perfect in this branch as possible; and we have been told that the\r\nlatter particularly is the most magnificent in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe shall now as briefly as possible advert to the contents of this volume.\r\n\r\nIn the Ornithological department the systems of Cuvier and Temminck have\r\nmostly superseded all others: as a whole, we give a decided preference to\r\nthe latter, as being more natural, though it may be doubted if the generic\r\ndistinctions are not too few, while those of Cuvier are too many: both\r\nhowever can be considered only as sketches, subject to improvement--as\r\nnatural affinities are more studied.\r\n\r\nRegarding that part of our work which relates to Entomology, we have given\r\na decided preference to the Lepidoptera, for the simple reason that this\r\norder has received less attention from all writers, concerning their real\r\ncharacters and affinities, than any other; indeed they have been most\r\nunaccountably neglected even by Latreille, the great founder of the modern\r\nschool: we have therefore thought it necessary to propose in this\r\ndepartment many new genera, and only have to regret that their definitions\r\ncould not be made more perfect without the destruction of the specimens,\r\nfrequently not our own, and which therefore was unattainable: a more\r\nextended knowledge of the natural affinities existing in this tribe, will\r\nalone confirm or annul the propriety of these distinctions.\r\n\r\nIn _Conchology_ many of the genera long established on the Continent, but\r\nnew to our own collectors, have been characterized and illustrated, as well\r\nas specific distinctions defined between shells hitherto considered as\r\nvarieties; and here it must be observed that so much latitude has been\r\ngiven to the meaning of the term _variety_, that in its general acceptation\r\nits definition becomes impossible: our own idea of its true meaning is, a\r\nshell possessing one or more characters which are changeable and uncertain,\r\nand which consequently will not serve as indications by which it may\r\ninfallibly be distinguished from all others; _variety_ depends on local\r\ncircumstances, and affects the size, colour, and greater or less\r\ndevelopment of the same modification of structure; a _species_ is\r\npermanent, its structure always the same though more or less developed,\r\nproducing and perpetuating its kind, and depending on formation,\r\ndiscernible in youth, and matured in age: we cannot therefore comprehend\r\nthe contradictory term of _permanent varieties_ in a state of nature\r\n(though such occur in domesticated animals), which some authors have used,\r\nand which has led to, in many instances, the most erroneous conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is lamentable to see the opposition which is still made by our own\r\nwriters against all the modern improvements; yet although Linnaean\r\nIntroductions to Conchology are constantly issuing from the press, the\r\ndesire of being acquainted with a more natural and intelligible\r\nclassification has already appeared; and as we are frequently questioned on\r\nthe subject, we cannot in this place do better than refer the young student\r\nto the valuable article on Conchology contained in the late supplement to\r\nthe _Encyclopedia Britannica_, the perusal of which will convey more solid\r\ninformation, and less perplexity, than all the Introductions our\r\nbooksellers can boast of.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the quotations or synonyms, it should be observed that we\r\nhave in most instances limited them only to original works, all doubtful\r\nones have been rejected, and such only given as have been actually\r\nconsulted; indeed to this latter cause must be attributed the occasional\r\nomission of some, existing in books we had not the immediate power of\r\nconsulting; our own library is not small; but the difficulty and expense of\r\nprocuring all the new continental publications, and the impossibility of\r\nmeeting with them at our public libraries[2], may have sometimes led us\r\ninto error, and unintentionally to have passed over the discoveries of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWith the few additions contained in the Appendix we shall now conclude;\r\ntrusting that in the remarks drawn from us by the present state of the\r\nscience in this country, our zeal for truth will not give us an appearance\r\nof want of candour or of vanity. The truth of our remarks on the labours of\r\nothers, every one at all acquainted with the subject can inquire into, and\r\neither acknowledge or disprove: we neither deprecate nor despise criticism:\r\nan author who presumes to instruct others, should have his pretensions\r\npublicly canvassed, his merits admitted, or his deficiency exposed; no one\r\nis more sensible than we are that our own pretensions chiefly consist in\r\nhaving set an example for others more able to follow: and if we have in any\r\nway advocated the cause of truth and science, our object will be attained,\r\nand we shall then gladly retire in the shade.\r\n\r\n  LONDON,\r\n  Sept. 15, 1821.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF BOOKS REFERRED TO.\r\n\r\n    _Bruguire, Encycl.

There\r\nis a wide difference between naturalists who compile, and form their\r\ntheories from books, and those who study nature, and think for themselves;\r\nand nothing will result from the first but mischief to the science, and\r\nperplexity to the student.\r\n\r\nOur figure is from a specimen brought from Demerara by C.

My\r\nfriend Dr. Leach, with his usual liberality, permitted me to draw the\r\naccompanying figure of it at the British Museum, where it is now deposited.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been taken near Nice in the Mediterranean, adhering to a\r\nsounding-line, in very deep water; a very singular locality, since nearly\r\nall the Mitres have generally been supposed to inhabit the tropical seas,\r\nor at least far from the coasts of Europe. It should, however, be remarked,\r\nthat _Cypraea lurida_, an Asiatic shell, I have found on the shores of\r\nGreece: and C. Ulysses, in his travels in the kingdom of Naples, enumerates\r\nseveral shells as inhabiting the warm shores of the Tarentine Bay, which\r\nare generally known only as natives of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. These\r\nfacts, with many others, prove the physical distribution of _Molluscae_ to\r\nbe less decidedly marked than almost any other class of animals.\r\n\r\nThis genus is included with that of _Voluta_ by Linnaeus and our own\r\nwriters, although long ago justly separated by the continental zoologists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 4\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBULIMUS melastomus.\r\n\r\n_Blackmouthed Bulimus._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Testa ovalis, vel oblongo-ovalis.

The generic characters above given will\r\ndistinguish them as peculiar to the tropics, and principally those of South\r\nAmerica; one or two species only being found in Africa, and five or six\r\ninhabiting India.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt this is the _Pap. Statira_ of Cramer; it is found only in\r\nBrazil, and has been erroneously considered by Godart and Latreille as a\r\nvariety of _C. Jugurthina_, an Indian insect, and which in fact is not in\r\nitself a species, being no other than the female of _C. Alcmeone_, as an\r\nattentive examination of a vast number of both, collected in Java by Dr.\r\nHorsfield, enabled me to ascertain.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary prolongation of the last joint of the palpi, and the\r\nwhite borderless spots beneath, which are never silvered, will distinguish\r\nthis species through all the variations; in the ground colour of its wings,\r\nwhich in no two specimens are exactly alike, and one before me is nearly\r\nwhite; the lesser snowy dot is sometimes very obscure, and often wanting;\r\nbut the prolongation of the palpi is even expressed in Cramer's figure\r\nabove quoted.\r\n\r\nI have examined about a dozen specimens, mostly captured by myself, and all\r\nhave been females; and I strongly suspect future and more decided\r\nobservations will prove _C. Evadne_ to be the other sex: it has the palpi\r\nlengthened, though in a less degree; and the articulations of the antennae\r\nin both insects will be found somewhat thickened at their termination when\r\nviewed under a magnifier, a peculiarity I have seen in no other species;\r\nand although I have examined near thirty specimens of _C. Evadne_, they\r\nhave invariably proved to be males.\r\n\r\nThe palpi in this insect will be found at variance with the generic\r\ncharacter now given; a striking proof that in a natural system no single\r\npart can be taken as an unerring criterion for generic distinction, without\r\nmaking it eventually an artificial one. The _Colias Drya_ of Fabricius has\r\nthe same formation of palpi, but is a totally different insect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 6\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCOLIAS Leachiana.\r\n\r\n_Leachian Colias._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _C. alis subrotundatis, integris, virescenti-albidis, anticis supra\r\n    fulvis, margine punctoque medio nigris, singulis subtus macula centrali\r\n    ferruginea._ Encycl.

E. Leach, of the British Museum, whose talents are too well\r\nknown to need any eulogium in this place.\r\n\r\nIt appears to inhabit both the northern and southern extremities of Brazil;\r\nfor I have seen it in a box sent from Para, and my specimens were captured\r\nin Minas Geraes by my friend Dr. Langsdorff. It is, however, a rare\r\nspecies; for I have only seen seven or eight specimens, and they were all\r\nmales: the female, when found, will probably differ as remarkably as in\r\nmost of this genus.\r\n\r\nThe opaque spot on the inferior wings above is very large; but the tuft of\r\nhair corresponding beneath the superior wings, is entirely wanting. It\r\nshould be likewise observed, that although this insect in every outward\r\nrespect resembles a genuine _Colias_ (the type of which may be _C. Ebule_),\r\nit differs very materially in the terminal appendages of the abdomen; the\r\nlast joint being the shortest, and scarcely pointed; and the hook, instead\r\nof being concealed beneath this segment, is exserted beyond it, and met by\r\ntwo others, one at the base of each lateral valve: these valves are also\r\nmuch shorter, ovate, and not attenuated, although ending in an incurved\r\nhook. In the present ignorance in which a true knowledge of the Lepidoptera\r\nis involved, it is impossible to say how far these dissimilarities may\r\npoint out natural groups; it is therefore of the highest importance to the\r\nscience such facts should be noticed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 7\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCARDUELIS cucullata.\r\n\r\n_Hooded Seed-eater._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Rostrum breve, validum, conicum, rectissimum; mandibulis\r\n    subaequalibus; apice immarginato, recto, acuto; mandibula superiore\r\n    culmine convexa; inferiore basi marginis angulata, utrinque subtusque\r\n    convexa._\r\n\r\nTypus Genericus _Fringilla Canaria_.

The base of the shell is more deeply and distinctly striated;\r\nboth the lips are much thickened, tumid, white, and highly polished;\r\nterminating above in obtuse points on the second spiral whorl, leaving a\r\nnarrow ascending channel between; the inside of the aperture is a fine\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nInhabits the Indian seas, but is not common.\r\n\r\nBy some unaccountable oversight, Mr. Dillwyn has very well described this\r\nshell, but under the name and supposition of its being the _S. marginatus_\r\nof Linnaeus; though a few pages after he brings all the true synonyms\r\nreferring to his shell, under a description purporting to be that of _S.\r\nminimus_, but which in reality is more applicable to our next species. Why\r\nthis writer should doubt the correctness of Gmelin, Chemnitz, &c.\r\nrespecting the true _S. marginatus_ of Linnaeus, does not appear,\r\nparticularly as he has substituted for it a well known species. I have\r\nlittle doubt myself they all mean one and the same shell, which is nothing\r\nmore than a scarce variety of _S. accinctus_, now before me, with which\r\nLinnaeus's original description pretty well agrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTROMBUS variabilis.\r\n\r\n_Variable Strombus--upper figure._\r\n\r\n    _S. testa nodose plicata, spira striis nullis; labio interiore\r\n    simplice, exteriore reflecto, intra laevi, supra leviter lobato._\r\n\r\n    Shell with nodulous plaits, the spire not striated.

In the\r\npresent insect the posterior and exterior margins are of equal length,\r\ngiving a narrow appearance to the wings, much resembling some of the true\r\n_Papilionidae_; but in _P. Jairus_, these wings are much broader, more\r\nobtuse, and the length of the posterior margin much greater; other minor\r\ndifferences exist in the colouring and markings. My valued friend A. H.\r\nHaworth, Esq., F.L.S., &c. possesses a fine pair of the true _P. Jairus_ in\r\nhis rich and extensive collection; and the liberality with which it is\r\nconstantly and freely opened to me, deserves my warmest thanks.\r\n\r\nFrom these two species I have formed the present genus, the characters of\r\nwhich will distinguish it from that of _Haetera_ (Fabr.), a scanty genus\r\nconfined to South America; and this seems to occupy its place in India:\r\nboth will come in the natural family of _Hipparchidae_. Only one specimen\r\n(a male) exists in Dr. Horsfield's collections; I could not therefore\r\ndissect the mouth, &c. On the inner borders of the inferior wings is a\r\nlengthened tuft of fine hairs: the _anus_ beneath has on each side an\r\nobtuse lengthened process, partially attached, and which appears to supply\r\nthe place of the lateral valves. It is represented on a sprig of\r\n\r\nGAERTNERA _racemosa_,\r\n\r\nwhich, although differing slightly from the figure of Dr. Roxburgh's\r\nCoromandel Plants, p. 19. t. 18, Dr. Horsfield considers as the same plant.\r\nThe Javanese name is _Kakas_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 12\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGOBIUS Suerii.\r\n\r\n_Suerian Goby._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Caput parvum.

The construction of the bill in all these birds will be found\r\nprecisely the same, though more or less developed in each division, and\r\neven in the species; it thus becomes impossible to draw the line of\r\ndemarcation without refining too much on generic distinctions. Their bills,\r\nalthough so broad, are by no means stout; thus enabling them to prey with\r\ngreater readiness on the _Lepidoptera_ and other large winged insects with\r\nsoft bodies; while the long stiff bristles at the base of the bill seem\r\nintended to confine the resistance their prey would otherwise make by their\r\nwings. The illustrious Cuvier has well observed, that the true Flycatchers\r\nhave the bill longer, narrowed, less compressed, and the tip but slightly\r\nbent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 14\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPICUS rubiginosus.\r\n\r\n_Brown Woodpecker._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Rostrum polyedrum, rectum, in apicem compressum, cuneatum, attenuatum.\r\n    Nares basales, ovales, patulae, plumis angustis recumbentibus tectae.\r\n    Lingua longissima, jaculatoria, apice sagittato.

The posterior margin in the wings of the male is sinuated; in the\r\nfemale it is nearly straight; the underside of the wings in both sexes is\r\nthe same; the anterior pair reddish-brown, paler in the middle; the tip and\r\nposterior margin whitish: inferior wings reddish-orange towards the inner\r\nmargin, with an obsolete central curved band of the same, and a black dot\r\nat the base of the inferior wings. The head, palpi, and thorax are margined\r\nwith orange, less conspicuous in the female.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the genus _Hesperia_ of Latreille (under which the present\r\ninsect would come) is little more than what was known of _Scarabaeus_\r\ntwenty years ago; nor has Fabricius even noticed one half of the species\r\nfigured by Cramer.

The\r\npresent bird is nearly the smallest of its family: I found it only once in\r\nthe interior of Bahia in Brazil, where it must be very rare, or frequent to\r\nparticular districts only.

Although in the construction of their bills they perfectly\r\nresemble the Swallows, their wings are not formed for long or rapid flight;\r\nand their feet are much stronger, and calculated for searching among\r\nbranches for their food, in which situations I have frequently seen them.\r\nThe term \"_pedes ambulatorii_,\" or walking-feet, is applied too generally,\r\nand should be confined to the gallinaceous and Pigeon tribes.\r\n\r\nThis genus was formed by Count Hoffmansegg, and the present is the smallest\r\nspecies known: our figure is of the male bird. Total length about five\r\ninches and a half. The bill from the angle to the tip measures seven lines;\r\nbut from the nostrils only three lines and a half. The middle of the body,\r\nvent, and under tail-covers in the male are pure white; in the female\r\nyellowish, with a line of olive-green down the middle of each shaft; the\r\nquills, wing-covers, and tail-feathers are black, margined in the male with\r\nblue, and in the female with green: the tail is slightly forked. The\r\nnostrils round and bare; the base of the bill has a few weak setaceous\r\nhairs. The legs resemble the true Chatterers, having the outer toe rather\r\nlonger than the inner, and attached to the base of the middle.\r\n\r\nThis is a scarce bird, apparently not hitherto described; I met with it\r\nonly three times in Bahia; but it appears more frequent in the southern\r\nprovinces of Brazil, specimens having been sent me from Minas Geralis and\r\nRio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 22\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTERIAS Elvina.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Antennae breves, clava subtruncata, compressa.

The true\r\nfemale I have never seen; I suspect it will want the gibbous curve on the\r\nhinder wings of the male, which sex is, indeed, not common, and is\r\ngenerally much smaller, and sometimes half the size only, of the figure.\r\n\r\n_Papilio Nicippe_ of Cramer (tab. 210. fig.

A very perfect one exists in my father's collection which\r\nmeasures only two inches one line long: it differs slightly in wanting the\r\nlower white band and its inferior border: there is also an additional small\r\nplait between the second and third, a variation not uncommon in the\r\nLinnaean Volutes, and which lessens the importance of this character as a\r\nspecific distinction.\r\n\r\nIt is unfigured, and I believe undescribed, unless perhaps in Solander's\r\nMSS. In its small state it may have been overlooked as one of the numerous\r\nvarieties of _M. vulpecula_; but the sharp angulated plaitings, the\r\ncancellated base, and the numerous faintly-grooved lines on the spire, as\r\nwell as the more slender and lengthened form, will at once distinguish it:\r\nits colours also are very striking and dissimilar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 24\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCONOELIX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Testa coniformis; spira brevissima; labium exterius simplex; columella\r\n    plicata; apertura linearis, angusta, spira longior._\r\n\r\nTypus Genericus _Conoelix lineatus_.

Their bills seem formed for swallowing their food\r\nmore in an entire state, similar to the Herons. In each of these genera one\r\nspecies exists with only three toes, a remarkable circumstance, which in an\r\nartificial system would endanger their being united in a separate genus;\r\nbut which, from the remarkable smallness of the inner toe in all the other\r\nspecies, cannot I apprehend point out any peculiarity either in their habit\r\nor economy: and this opinion I find is likewise entertained by Professor\r\nTemminck.\r\n\r\nTotal length seven inches and a quarter. Bill from the gape two inches one\r\nline, the upper mandible rather longest, and both with a slight appearance\r\nof a notch; the colour black. All the upper plumage, as well as the sides\r\nof the head, ears, and stripe beyond, fine ultramarine blue, more vivid on\r\nthe rump and tail-covers, and duller on the tail, wing-covers, and lesser\r\nquill-margins; front blackish; from the nostrils to the eye a whitish line,\r\nand from the ears on each side the neck a whitish stripe, which almost\r\nforms a collar round the nape. Quill-feathers sooty black. All the under\r\nparts orange ferrugineous; throat and belly nearly white. Tail very short,\r\nnearly hid by the upper covers. Feet red, claws black. The inner fore-toe\r\nwanting, but a slight rudiment of it exists in my specimen.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, I find this bird is figured and described in a\r\nbeautiful work commenced by Lewin on the birds of New Holland, which Mr.\r\nBrown, the learned possessor of the Banksian library, pointed out to me. I\r\nbelieve but a few copies are known. Lewin observes, \"it inhabits heads of\r\nrivers, visiting dead trees, from the branches of which it darts on its\r\nprey in the water beneath, and is sometimes completely immersed by the\r\nvelocity of its descent.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Latham has very well described it, but quite overlooked the\r\nconstruction of the feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 27\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHALCYON collaris.\r\n\r\n_Collared Crabeater._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Rostrum longissimum, rectum, validum, ad basin latius quam altius,\r\n    lateribus tetragonis; mandibula superiore rectissima, ad basin\r\n    rotundata; inferiore carinata, recurvata, margine superioris inferiorem\r\n    obtegente.

One of them (the _Alcedo Senegalensis_ of\r\nLatham) is known to feed on crabs, the breaking and disjointing of which\r\nthis structure seems admirably calculated to accomplish; and although some\r\nauthors mention insects also as their food, I apprehend it is only in the\r\nabsence of other larger prey more suited to the construction of their\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nTotal length eight inches and a half. Bill two inches three lines from the\r\ngape, and one inch three quarters from the nostrils; upper mandible and\r\nmargin and lip of the lower, black, the rest yellowish-white. The general\r\nplumage above is pale and changeable greenish-blue, the green predominating\r\non the scapulars, head and tail; the upper part of the neck is crossed by a\r\nwhite collar, separated from the green of the head by a narrow margin of\r\nblack, which passes on the ear-feathers round the nape; a narrow whitish\r\nline runs from the nostrils to the eyebrows, and another very short one is\r\nbeneath the eye; the whole of the under plumage white. Quills black edged\r\nwith blue, the second, third and fourth equal and longest. Wings four\r\ninches and a quarter. Tail even, near three inches long, above blue-green,\r\nbeneath black. Feet dusky; middle and outer claws much longer than the leg.\r\n\r\nInhabits Java and other parts of India, and is I believe unfigured. The\r\nline at the bottom of the plate is on the scale of an inch.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, Temminck's new edition of the _Manuel\r\nd'Ornithologie_ has just reached me, in which I perceive he has continued\r\nthe birds of this genus under that of _Alcedo_, observing that their\r\nplumage is always shining, and that he can find no characters for their\r\ngeographic distribution: yet, notwithstanding the opinion of this eminent\r\nornithologist, a close attention will I believe prove, first, that no\r\nspecies of Linnaean _Alcedo_ bearing the characters of _Halcyon_ have yet\r\nbeen discovered as natives of America; and secondly, that species of\r\ngenuine _Alcedo_ will be found with plumage quite devoid of any bright or\r\nshining colours. One or two exist in my own cabinet, but to which I cannot\r\nnow refer.\r\n\r\nThe situation of _Halcyon_ will be between _Alcedo_ and _Dacelo_; from the\r\nlast of which it is distinguished by its perfectly straight, acute, and\r\nentire upper mandible, which, on the contrary, in _Dacelo_ is notched, the\r\ntip bent and obtuse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 28\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHESPERIA Haworthiana.\r\n\r\n_Haworth's Hesperia._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Antennae mediocres vel elongatae, rectae, graciles; clava\r\n    subterminali, brevi, crassata, cylindracea; unco abrupto, brevi,\r\n    acuminato.

The simple characters\r\npeculiar in a greater or less degree to all, will readily distinguish them;\r\nand I apprehend most of the species of the first division (which includes\r\nthe present) will be found to inhabit only the African continent, while\r\n_Bulla virginea_ and the smaller shells placed in the second division are\r\nfound principally in the new world; where also two or three gigantic\r\nspecies of _Bulimus_ occupy the place of the larger African _Achatinae_.\r\n\r\nOf these, the shell now figured is one of the rarest, and has hitherto been\r\noverlooked as a variety of the Linnaean _Bulla Achatina_; the colour of\r\nboth is subject to much variation; but this will be found at best a most\r\nindecisive and vague character for specific distinction when unaccompanied\r\nby others more important and connected with the formation of shells. I have\r\ntherefore not hesitated in making this a distinct species, from having had\r\nthe means of examining at different times near twenty specimens, all of\r\nwhich presented the following characters. Spire of five whorls, the last or\r\nterminal one very small and flattened; the apex obtuse; the suture\r\ndepressed, as if flattened on the shell, and margined by one or sometimes\r\ntwo indented lines, parallel, and at the top of each whorl. In the colour\r\nof its mouth it varies in sometimes having a tinge of rose-colour at the\r\nbase and top of the spire, but the mouth is more generally white. The body\r\nwhorl is more or less ventricose; the outer lip is a little reflected, and\r\nthe whole shell, when full grown, much thicker and heavier than any of the\r\nother species. The epidermis is yellowish-brown, beneath which the shell is\r\nnearly white, beautifully marked with broad remote stripes of chesnut, with\r\nothers more slender (and sometimes broken into spots) between. I have\r\nanother specimen which agrees tolerably with Lister's figure in being more\r\nthan usually ventricose, and which I think is accidental. The only constant\r\nvariety appears to be that figured by Knorr, ii. tab. 3. fig. 1. having the\r\nspire entirely rose-colour.\r\n\r\nThe marginal line and the correct number of whorls in the spire are well\r\nexpressed in the figures of Lister, Gualtieri and Knorr. The first of these\r\nfigures is accidentally more ventricose; the second, like all the other\r\nfigures of Gualtieri, is defective at the apex; and Knorr's I suspect has\r\nbeen outrageously coloured from the real pink-mouthed _Achatina_.\r\n\r\nIt inhabits the coast of Guinea; and I am informed the animal is eaten by\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 31\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPHIBALURA cristata.\r\n\r\n_Crested Shortbill._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    (_Phibalura_ Vieillot.)\r\n\r\n    _Rostrum brevissimum, trigonum, latius quam altum; mandibula superiore\r\n    culmine subcurvata carinata; inferiore recta; utrisque marginatis.\r\n    Nares basales, simplices, subrotundae, plumulis densis incumbentibus in\r\n    totum obtectae.

Yeates,\r\nof the Dingle near Liverpool, who received it from South America. Its\r\ngeneral habit clearly points it out as belonging to the _Baccavorae_ or\r\nBerryeaters, apparently connecting the genera _Procnias_ and _Pipra_, where\r\nTemminck with much judgement has also placed it, in the new edition of his\r\n_Manuel d'Ornithologie_ just received, and before reading which I had\r\nconsidered the genus as unpublished.\r\n\r\nThe total length is nine inches, of which the tail occupies four and a\r\nhalf. The bill is whitish, and is remarkably short, measuring only three\r\nlines from the nostrils to the tip, but three quarters of an inch from the\r\nangle of the mouth, which opens just under the eye: the plumage is\r\nsingularly variegated: the crown of the head is furnished with a crest,\r\nwhich, when not elevated, is scarcely seen, and appears a deep glossy black\r\nmixed with grey and rufous; but when erected it is very conspicuous, and\r\nall the feathers are bright rufous tipt more or less with black; the upper\r\nsides of the head grey, the lower part and ears deep-black; the neck above\r\nis greyish-white, with blackish transverse lines: the back, scapulars, rump\r\nand tail-covers are varied transversely with olive, shining black, and\r\nbright yellow, each feather being olive at the base, black in the middle,\r\nand yellow at the tip. Beneath the feathers of the chin and part of the\r\nthroat are somewhat lengthened, semi-setaceous, and of a bright yellow; the\r\nneck and breast are white, with two transverse lines of deep black on each\r\nfeather; these lines diminish, and are broken into spots on the body, and\r\nnearly disappear on the vent: the edges of the breast-feathers are tipt\r\nwith yellow, which colour increases downwards on the vent and tail-covers,\r\nwhich latter are entirely yellow. The wings are four inches long, uniform\r\ndeep black with a blue gloss, much pointed, and calculated for rapid\r\nflight. Tail the same colour, the exterior basal margins olive: all the\r\nfeathers are narrow, pointed, and gradually lengthening, the middle pair\r\nbeing two inches three quarters longer than the outer pair, which exceed\r\nthose next them by an inch. The feet are very pale yellow, and\r\nthree-quarters of an inch from the knee to the claws, the three foremost of\r\nwhich are equally connected together (though slightly) nearly as far as the\r\nfirst joint; the outer and inner toes equal, and rather shorter than the\r\nhind-toe: claws slender and much compressed.\r\n\r\nWhether this species is the same as the one mentioned by Temminck as\r\nexisting in the French Museum under the name of _P. flavirostris_, it is\r\nquite impossible to say, as the description of that bird has never been\r\npublished. This leads me to notice a custom several naturalists of the\r\npresent day have lately adopted, of publishing names, and names only, of\r\nnew or undescribed animals, which they then wish to be considered as\r\npermanently fixed, and as having thus secured to themselves all the merit\r\nof first describing. Now this at best is but a surreptitious path to fame,\r\nand in many instances bears the appearance of originating in a petty\r\nvanity, quite beneath the dignity of true science: it is easily fixing a\r\nname to an object which we have not before seen, or suspect may be new,\r\nwithout the trouble of investigating authors and comparing synonyms: the\r\nname may remain, but if it should afterwards be discovered as hasty and\r\nerroneous, its author is in no way amenable to the opinions and criticisms\r\nof others, for they cannot discover such mistakes when no clue is given\r\nthem beyond a name, which may frequently be applicable to half a dozen\r\nspecies. If, on the other hand, the object is really new, the scientific\r\nworld is still in the dark, for without a description the name conveys\r\nnothing. Besides this, it has a tendency to deprive those writers of their\r\nwell-earned merit, who undergo the laborious but necessary investigation of\r\nbooks, the examining and comparing of specimens, and the construction of\r\nsound characters previous to their publishing a new addition to the great\r\nvolume of Nature. Against this _scientific monopoly_ a stand should be\r\nmade, and all names either of families, genera, or species should be\r\ntotally rejected, unless their meaning is clearly defined. Let those who\r\nrun the race, receive the wreath; and not let it be snatched from the\r\nwinning-post by another, who jumps from behind and claims it as his own.\r\n\r\nOn a careful examination of my specimen, I find the nostrils are not\r\ncovered by a membrane, as observed by Temminck, but are open, obliquely and\r\novately round, and a narrow rim round the margin. That excellent\r\nornithologist likewise remarks that the first and second quill-feathers are\r\nthe longest; but my bird (which, however, is in full plumage) has the first\r\nand third of equal length and shorter than the second, which is longest.\r\nThese nice distinctions lead me to suppose the species from which his\r\ngeneric character was taken, is distinct from this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 32\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPSARIS Cuvierii.\r\n\r\n_Cuvier's Psaris._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _Rostrum validum, crassum, conicum, basi rotundatum, versus apicem\r\n    leviter compressum, culmine convexo non carinato; mandibulis\r\n    emarginatis, superiore apice adunco.

Bill blueish, three quarters of an\r\ninch from the angle of the mouth, and four-tenths from the nostrils, which\r\nare ovately round, rather large, and simple, being entirely devoid of an\r\nexternal membrane, but the base is partially covered with small thick-set,\r\nshort, setaceous feathers; between the eye and base of the bill are a few\r\nweak and short hairs; the upper part of the head, as far as the nape, is\r\ncapped by deep-black, having a blueish gloss: between the nostrils and the\r\neye, as well as on the chin and throat, the colour is white, which changes\r\nto a pale cinereous grey on the sides of the head and round the neck; the\r\nears at their base and margin of the eye tinged with yellow; the rest of\r\nthe upper plumage yellowish-olive. The under plumage on the lower part of\r\nthe neck and breast, the sides, and the inner wing-covers are clear yellow,\r\nand from that to the vent white.

I have not\r\nseen more than twelve or fourteen species, and these were all from\r\ndifferent parts of South America, to which I have no doubt the genus is\r\nexclusively confined. The club of their antennae is very thick, obtuse, and\r\nwithout any terminal hook. The bright red at the end of the abdomen\r\n(improperly called by Fabricius the tail) is most conspicuous in the\r\nfemale, which is also larger and having the wings more obtuse, of which the\r\nupper and under surfaces are both alike.\r\n\r\nThe insects of this family fly with amazing rapidity (as is shown by the\r\nthickness of their thorax, and the sharpness in the make of their wings),\r\ngenerally frequenting openings of thick woods and alighting on leaves where\r\nthe sun strikes: I seldom saw them on flowers. Their wings when at rest are\r\nhalf expanded in a horizontal direction. Their metamorphosis is unknown.\r\n\r\nThis individual species is scarce in the northern parts of Brazil, but\r\ncommon in the southern provinces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 34\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCOLIAS Godartiana.\r\n\r\n_Godart's Colias._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _C.

The whole\r\nshell is very finely marked with longitudinal striae, and the colouring\r\nbetter seen than described: the buff tinge at the base is occasioned by the\r\nremaining epidermis.\r\n\r\nThis shell belongs to the second division of the genus _Achatina_ as\r\nmentioned at Plate 30, having the aperture much shorter than the spire and\r\nthe base nearly entire. _Bulla virginea_ of Linn. seems to connect the two\r\ndivisions, having the lengthened spire of one and the truncated base of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 37\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPROCNIAS cucullata.\r\n\r\n_Hooded Berry-eater._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 21.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _P. corpore, collo, pectore nigro cucullata; tergo fusco, alis caudaque\r\n    nigris; tegminum apice, pectoris lateribus, et corpore subtus flavis;\r\n    capite subcristato._\r\n\r\n    Head, neck and fore-part of the breast hooded with black; back brown,\r\n    wings and tail black; tip of the wing-covers, sides of the breast and\r\n    body beneath yellow; head subcrested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am indebted for this new bird to Miss E.

In this, the lower half of the inner lip, or\r\nmore properly the pillar, is nearly straight; the base entire, or without\r\nany notch or truncated appearance: whereas in the true _A. fasciata_, the\r\ninner lip at the base is very much curved inward, and notched before it\r\njoins the outer lip. The mouth is also short and broad: whereas in this it\r\nis much more oblong, and the base round.

The strict followers of Linnaeus, by thus\r\nrejecting generic distinctions, which at once convey a definite idea of\r\nform and structure, contribute to render systematic arrangement less\r\nexpressive of ideas than the common nomenclature of our sale catalogues: a\r\nstriking proof of the pertinacity with which we cherish those particular\r\ndoctrines we first imbibed, although an unbiassed reasoning and an\r\nattentive observance of nature would convince us of their fallacy.\r\n\r\nThe great Linnaeus, at the time he formed that system which laid the\r\nfoundation of systematic nomenclature, had not the materials for gathering\r\nand combining those natural genera which the immense discoveries made since\r\nhis death have given us a knowledge of. He accordingly arranged those few\r\nshells known to him, in large, and for the most part natural, groups. That\r\nof _Voluta_ I consider as one of these last (excepting the first division);\r\nbut the great accession of species now known, and which is still\r\nincreasing, has long ago induced the principal Continental writers to\r\ndivide this very extensive family into the following genera: _Marginella_\r\n(Date shells), _Oliva_ (Olives), _Mitra_ (Mitres), _Turbinellus_ (Turnip\r\nshells), _Voluta_ (Volutes), ...; all possessing not only clear but natural\r\ncharacters; inasmuch as, by such an arrangement, those interesting links\r\nand ramifications that connect this family with the _Bullae_, _Cones_,\r\n_Cowries_, _Murices_, and other genera, can be traced; and which perhaps\r\naffords the most fascinating and intellectual source of contemplation and\r\nstudy the science can bestow.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of this species will distinguish it among this numerous and\r\nintricate family. The basal suture is deeply channeled; those on the spire\r\ncovered by the polished callosity which spreads from the inner lip.\r\n\r\nMr. Dillwyn has adopted the unpublished name of Solander, although the\r\nshell had long ago been described and named by Martini and Lamarck.

Mr. Stephens has copied this error into\r\n\"General Zoology;\" and his description of this bird, as well as numberless\r\nothers, seems merely an abridgement or alteration of Latham's; a practice\r\nhighly detrimental to science; for, when an original description cannot be\r\nobtained, it is much better, and safer, to copy without disguise that of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nHow far all the birds included by Temminck in this genus really belong to\r\nit, admits of very great doubt; I have therefore constructed the generic\r\ncharacter from those birds of New Holland only which Lewin, who founded the\r\ngenus, must have had before him.\r\n\r\nTotal length seven inches and a half; bill seven-tenths, the frontal\r\nfeathers advancing half its length to the nostrils; those of the ears are\r\nlengthened, but the yellow tuft behind them is much more so; the feathers\r\nof the chin are small, thick-set, and ending in fine setaceous hairs curved\r\noutwards; the breast and body pale brownish-yellow.

When Professor Temminck was in England, I showed him the\r\nmanuscript description and drawing which I had then made: he assured me he\r\nhad never seen the bird before, otherwise than in Bullock's museum. A short\r\ntime after, my account of it was published. I observe, however, that in the\r\nnew edition of his Manuel he gives this name to a new bird of his own: no\r\ndescription however follows, and it is therefore impossible to say if the\r\nProfessor intends it for this identical species.\r\n\r\nWe must postpone any further observations on this family, and conclude by\r\ngiving the original description above alluded to.\r\n\r\nTotal length twelve inches, of which the bill in extreme length measures\r\nthree. It is much curved, and more attenuated than any of the Aracaris,\r\nbeing thickest at the base; from which it narrows to a sharp point at the\r\ntip. The upper part is convex, and somewhat thickened; the sides are\r\ncompressed, and the upper mandible has two broad slightly indented grooves\r\non each side: the base has a few transverse wrinkles, and the serratures\r\ndeep and unequal. The lower mandible half the depth of the upper, the sides\r\nconcave, and the teeth less. The colour (in the dried bird) black; the base\r\nof the lower and the upper half of the superior mandible rufous, the base\r\nwith a whitish marginal line. The nostrils are more lateral than usual,\r\nbeing placed in a line with the eye; the orbits naked and reddish brown,\r\nthe feathers encircling which (particularly beneath the eye) are vivid\r\ncerulean blue. The whole upper plumage is parrot green, paler beneath, with\r\na gloss of golden yellow on the cheeks and sides: throat dusky white. Wings\r\nshort, five inches long, and rounded; inner shafts of the quills black,\r\nmargined with whiteish. Tail cuneated, green, four inches and a half long,\r\nthe four middle feathers equal.

A question naturally arises, why\r\nthe bills of these birds should be so monstrously out of proportion, and\r\nwhat possible use they can be applied to. The elucidation of these\r\nquestions is highly interesting, and calls for the most accurate\r\nobservations to be made in their native regions. It will be sufficient for\r\nthe present, however, to point out, with regard to the Linnaean Toucans,\r\nthat the accurate observations and anatomical knowledge of my valued friend\r\nDr. Traill, F.R.S.E., of Liverpool, have clearly proved that an immense\r\nnumber of nerves and fibres fill the cavity of these bills, all connected\r\nwith the organs of smelling, which are in the highest state of development.\r\nA short notice on this subject will be found in the Linnaean Transactions;\r\nbut as my learned friend is pursuing his inquiries further on the subject,\r\nI shall for the present confine my remarks to the individual here\r\nillustrated, observing that no birds are so little understood, even in\r\nregard to the species, as these.\r\n\r\nThe indefatigable Edwards appears the first who noticed this bird. His\r\ndescription, though in the quaint style of the day, is clear and\r\ncomprehensive; and his figure strengthens it, both being made from the\r\nliving bird. Yet Dr. Latham has quite overlooked it as a variety of another\r\nspecies; and Dr. Shaw, although he copies Edwards's account, gives\r\nreferences which belong to other birds. It is not in the costly work of Le\r\nVaillant, and indeed seems (from its excessive rarity) to have escaped the\r\nnotice of all modern ornithologists. The perfect bill of the bird is,\r\nhowever, in my possession, minutely agreeing with Edwards's account; and\r\nalso an original sketch in oil of another individual, by an unknown artist,\r\nwith a note stating it was done from the life at Exeter 'Change. All these\r\ntestimonies put the existence of the bird beyond any doubt.\r\n\r\nHaving seen only the bill, which is well described by Edwards, I shall\r\nclose this article with such part of his description as appears necessary.\r\n\r\n\"The bill is very large, compressed sideways, having _a sharp ridge along\r\nthe upper part_; the upper mandible is green, with a long triangular spot\r\nof yellow colour on each side, and the ridge on the upper part yellow; the\r\nlower mandible is blue, with a shade of green in the middle, the point is\r\nred, it hath about five faint dusky bars, which cross the joinings of the\r\ntwo mandibles. The iris of the eye is a fair green colour; round the eye is\r\na broad space of naked skin of a violet colour: the throat and breast are\r\nof a bright yellow, below which is a bar of scarlet feathers; the covert\r\nfeathers of the tail are white above, beneath of a bright red; the legs and\r\nfeet are all of a blue or violet colour.\" Edwards says it was brought from\r\nJamaica, but doubts its being rather a native of the continent: he says\r\nthey are very rarely brought home alive.\r\n\r\nThe bill is full six inches long, and the whole figure on the same scale,\r\nboth in this and in Edwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 46\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBULIMUS citrinus,\r\n\r\n_Citron Bulimus._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 4.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _B. testa obovata; spira conica, in medio sub-crassata, apertura\r\n    longiore: spira anfractibus 6 in suturam depressis; labio exteriore\r\n    basi subcontracto; umbilico subclauso._\r\n\r\n    Shell obovate; spire conic, slightly thickened in the middle, longer\r\n    than the aperture, and of six volutions depressed on the suture;\r\n    outer-lip slightly contracted at the base; umbilicus nearly closed.\r\n\r\n    Bulimus citrinus, _var._ B. _Bruguiere Encycl.

As far as my own observation\r\ngoes, I have found that the thickened spire, the depression of the whorls\r\non the suture, and the narrowness or contraction of the mouth at the base,\r\nafford the only constant characters; for, in regard to colour and the\r\nsituation of the mouth, both appear subject to great variation, the latter\r\nbeing as often reversed as regular. Martini's is the only figure that can\r\nbe safely quoted for this variety.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mrs. Bolton, of Storr's-hall, Windermere, for the loan of\r\nthis and several other rare shells: it formerly belonged to Mr. Jennings,\r\nand appears an old shell, being heavy in proportion, the umbilicus thickly\r\nclosed up, and the outer-lip very thick. Another I have seen at Mrs.\r\nMawe's, and one is in the British Museum: but the finest specimen in colour\r\nand preservation is in the possession of my friend W. J. Broderip, Esq., of\r\nLincoln's-Inn: from this it seems the spiral whorls are finely and\r\ndelicately marked by transverse elevated striae, while those on the basal\r\nvolution are striated transversely, though in a less regular manner.\r\n\r\nBruguiere mentions that this species is generally found in the South\r\nAmerican islands, Cayenne, and Guiana.\r\n\r\nMr. Dillwyn has given the new name of _aurea_ to this shell, in addition to\r\nthe five others under which different authors have described it. Such\r\nchanging of names and multiplication of synonyms, without strong reasons,\r\nare very objectionable. I have retained that of _Bruguiere_, as being the\r\nonly author who has placed it in its proper genus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 47\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBULIMUS citrinus (_var_. perversu).\r\n\r\n_Reverse, banded Citron Bulimus._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 4.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 46.\r\n\r\n    SYNONYMS.\r\n\r\n    _Martini, vol._ 9. _tab._ 934 & 5. _Knorr_, 4. _tab._ 28. _fig._ 4, 5.\r\n    (bad.)\r\n\r\n    Bulimus citrinus, _var._ B. _Bruguiere_, 314. 27.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA fine pair of this beautiful and rare variety is in the collection of Mr.\r\nC.

The regular convexity of the whorls, not in any\r\ndegree compressed at the suture, the want of that thickened appearance on\r\nthe spire, and of the contraction at the base of the mouth (all which\r\ncharacters I have found in the varieties of _B. citrinus_ to be constant),\r\nafford a specific distinction which future observations must confirm or\r\nannul. Bruguiere notices a variety of _B. citrinus_ which is entirely\r\nyellow, a most beautiful specimen of which is in the British Museum, and\r\nwhich possesses (as well as the excellent figure of Gualtieri) all the\r\nspecific characters I have given to _B. citrinus_, but not of the present\r\nshell.

This, together\r\nwith its excessive rarity, and the opportunity of giving original figures,\r\nhas induced me to include it in this work, although it exists both in those\r\nof Martini and Martyn above quoted. I have neither seen nor heard of\r\nspecimens being in any other collection, besides the two above noticed; and\r\nwhich no doubt were collected by their late lamented possessor on some of\r\nthe South Sea islands.

I discovered however three or four of both sexes,\r\nvarying in size, in Mr. Haworth's cabinet, and the perfect similarity in\r\ncolour of the female with the other sex is very striking: it wants of\r\ncourse the little tuft of hair and opaque spot within the borders of the\r\nwings, so generally found in the male _Coliadae_.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions of _Colias Pyrene_ as a species rest on the areola of the\r\nanterior wings being considerably larger in proportion than in the others\r\nallied to it, thus making the black dot (which is always placed at the\r\nouter extremity of the areola) much nearer the tip than the base: these\r\nwings are also more sharply trigonal (in the male), and have only the\r\nslightest appearance of a black margin; the hinder wings are also perfectly\r\nentire, and not obtusely undulated as in those insects, and the sexes not\r\ndiffering in colour. Like most of the insects of this genus, the ocellate\r\nspots beneath vary considerably; sometimes they are silvery, at other times\r\nnot; the anal valves in the male are short and obtuse, and the wings in the\r\nfemale not so sharply pointed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 52\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCOLIAS argante.\r\n\r\n_Orange Colias._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 5.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _C.

I have had the\r\nsame opinion communicated to me by my friend Dr. Langsdorff, whose long\r\nresidence and observations in Brazil render his opinion of no small\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nAs both insects are well known, and their distinctions given in the\r\nspecific character, it will be only necessary to observe, that the under\r\nsurfaces of the wings in both sexes vary much both in the density of the\r\nminute dots, and short undulated stripes that spread over their surface;\r\nand that the silvery spots in some males are strongly marked, and in others\r\nquite obsolete: there is, in very fine individuals of this sex, a faint\r\nbloom of pink spread on the orange of the upper surface, which heightens\r\nthe vivid yet chaste beauty of the insect. The females are not so common.

Minor\r\ndifferences exist, in the mouth of this always being pink, the inner lip\r\nwhite, and the outer lip but slightly lobed (or cut out) above: in _S.\r\nLuhuanus_ the mouth is deep scarlet, inner lip black and highly polished,\r\nand the outer lip deeply notched above; the two former characters, indeed,\r\nbegin to show themselves at a very early growth of the shell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTROMBUS Persicus.\r\n\r\n_Persian Strombus__--middle figures._\r\n\r\n    _S. testa sub-coniformi, brevi; spira conica, aequali; labio exteriore\r\n    prominente, supra sinuato, intus glabro; interiore polito, albo._\r\n\r\n    Shell somewhat coniform, short; spire conic, equal.

Mr. Jennings had it\r\ncleaned, and in so doing many of the delicate transverse striae were\r\npartially obliterated, and the sharp ridges on the longitudinal ribs worn\r\ndown, as indeed was apparent from a drawing Captain L. had made of the\r\nshell previous to this unmerciful cleaning. It however still remains a very\r\nfine shell, and is now in the cabinet of Mrs. Bolton, of Storr's-hall, to\r\nwhom I am obliged for the opportunity of now publishing it.\r\n\r\nThe figure and specific character will sufficiently point out its\r\ndistinctions. The body-whorl is smooth, but strongly granulated at the\r\nbase; the spire delicately striated between the ribs; the two last whorls\r\nbefore the apex are close, thick, and somewhat papillary; the apex itself\r\nsmall and sharp.

Modern writers have, however, retained nearly all these in the\r\ngenus as left by Linnaeus; and this method for the present is more\r\ndesirable than that of creating a multiplicity of genera. Dr. Turton, in\r\nhis very useful Conchological Dictionary, enumerates thirteen species as\r\nfound on the British coast, including the _Solen Novacula_ of Montagu,\r\nwhich the Doctor suspects is not truly a species. The original specimens\r\nwhich Montagu described I have carefully inspected at the British Museum,\r\nand have no doubt in my own mind they are in reality no other than _S.\r\nSiliqua_ with one of the cardinal teeth broken off; a circumstance which,\r\nfrom their fragility, frequently happens, even in opening the recent shell.\r\n\r\n_Solen ambiguus_ was first described by Lamarck, who says it is from North\r\nAmerica. Two or three specimens are in my possession; but it is a rare\r\nspecies, much thicker, and with larger teeth than any other; the epidermis\r\nis pale-brown, and in some parts obliquely lineated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 56\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRAMPHASTOS vitellinus.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur-and-white-breasted Toucan._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 45.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _R. niger, gula flavo-aurantia; lateribus auribusque albis; fascia\r\n    pectorali tegminibusque rubris; rostro nigro fascia basali caerulea,\r\n    culmine subcurvato convexo, lateribus incrassatis._\r\n\r\n    Black; throat yellowish-orange; the sides and ears white; pectoral bar\r\n    and tail-covers red; bill black, with a blue basal belt, the top convex\r\n    and but slightly curved, the sides thickened.\r\n\r\n    R. vitellinus. _Illiger_ ----\r\n\r\n    Le Pignancoin. _Vaill. pl._ 7.\r\n\r\n    _Var._?

Tucanus_ in having the bill\r\nless curved, the top convex and obscure pink, not flat and blue. The belt\r\nat the base is always vivid blue (grey in the dead bird), not, as in _R.\r\nTucanus_, of a rich yellow. This I have never met with in Brazil; the other\r\nis common from lat. 8 to 23deg S. A drawing from the live bird by the late\r\nSydenham Edwards (obligingly lent me by Lord Stanley) confirms others I\r\nhave seen as to the colour of the bill, orbits, &c. It varies, however, in\r\nthat of the throat, breadth of the red band, and in the tail-covers. A\r\nspecimen I possess being somewhat larger, the breast is nearly white, and\r\nthe upper tail-covers sulphur. In young birds the white on the sides is\r\ntinged with grey. I am inclined to consider the _Grand Toucan a ventre\r\nrouge_ of Vaillant as a mere variety, having the red pectoral bar very\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nIn general size it is rather larger than the Brazilian Toucan.

It appertains to the Linnaean genus _Sphinx_,\r\nwhich can be viewed (from the immense diversity and great number of the\r\nspecies) only as a family containing many and striking natural genera: in\r\nmodern arrangement it is most nearly allied to the _Sesiae_ of Fabricius,\r\nfrom which, as it strikingly differs in the formation of the palpi and\r\nantennae, I have separated it.\r\n\r\nI have named this insect to commemorate the exertions of Mr. Abbott, well\r\nknown as having furnished the materials for that beautiful work the\r\nLepidopterous Insects of Georgia, edited by Sir James Edward Smith. And\r\nfrom the unpublished drawings of this zealous collector, the larva and pupa\r\nhave been figured. Mr. Abbott writes that it is a rare species in Georgia,\r\nand feeds on the grape. The female differs not in colour from the male,\r\nwhich is here represented.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPl. 61\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTAMYRIS Nurscia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERIC CHARACTER.--See Pl. 33.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n    _T. alis nigris, anticis supra fascia centrali rufescente, infra\r\n    punctis duobus ad basim albidis; posticis infra caesiis, cinereis, basi\r\n    nigris linea obsoleta albida; margine nigro._\r\n\r\n    Wings black; anterior above with a central reddish band, and two white\r\n    basal dots beneath; posterior beneath grey and cinereous; base black\r\n    with an obsolete white line; margin black.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe marginal fringe of the lower wings in this species has a few white dots\r\nbetween the nerves, and the upper surface is sprinkled or powdered in the\r\nmiddle with blueish-green atoms; on the under surface of the anterior wings\r\nthe lower part of the band is orange, the upper bright rufous; and within\r\nthe black margin of the posterior wings is a large blueish spot, and two or\r\nthree whitish dots on the sides of the thorax.

S. MacLeay, Esq. M.A. of Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. London, 1819. A work which for acuteness of reasoning and\r\nprofound research, has never been equalled either in this, or perhaps in\r\nany other country.\r\n\r\n[2] It is truly grievous in those which are privileged to possess\r\nthemselves of the works of their countrymen, however expensive, at free\r\ncost, and thus to inflict a ruinous fine on authors. Thus--National\r\nInstitutions, founded for the encouragement of learning, are made to\r\noppress and impoverish its followers.\r\n\r\n[3] Were it necessary at this time of day to point out the unnatural\r\nseparation of shells intimately connected with each other, which the\r\nLinnaean arrangement presents, it would be sufficient to observe, that the\r\ngenus _Bulimus_ is formed of shells scattered in the old genera of _Turbo_,\r\n_Helix_, and _Bulla_: thus we see in Mr. Dillwyn's Catalogue, the large\r\npink-mouthed African land-snail put in the same genus with our English\r\n_Bulla lignaria_, and _aperta_; the one inhabiting the depths of forests,\r\nand the others the depths of ocean!",
