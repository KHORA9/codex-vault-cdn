Smith, Ph.D._\r\n\r\n_Author of \"Skylark of Space\" and \"Skylark Three\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpacehounds of IPC\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A good many of us, who are now certain beyond a doubt that space\r\n    travel will forever remain in the realm of the impossible, probably\r\n    would, if a rocket that were shot to the moon, for instance, did\r\n    arrive, and perhaps return to give proof of its safe arrival on our\r\n    satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blase, twentieth\r\n    century manner. Dr. Smith, that phenomenal writer of classic\r\n    scientific fiction, seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of\r\n    the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the\r\n    reader to feel, after finishing \"Spacehounds of IPC,\" that travel\r\n    in the great spaces is not already an established fact. Dr. Smith,\r\n    as a professional chemist, is kept fairly busy. As a writer, he is\r\n    satisfied with nothing less than perfection. For that reason, a\r\n    masterpiece from his pen has become almost an annual event. We know\r\n    you will like \"Spacehounds\" even better than the \"Skylark\" series._\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrated by WESSO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe IPV _Arcturus_ Sets Out for Mars\r\n\r\n\r\nA narrow football of steel, the Interplanetary Vessel _Arcturus_ stood\r\nupright in her berth in the dock like an egg in its cup. A hundred feet\r\nacross and a hundred and seventy feet deep was that gigantic bowl, its\r\nwalls supported by the structural steel and concrete of the dock and\r\nlined with hard-packed bumper-layers of hemp and fibre. High into the\r\nair extended the upper half of the ship of space--a sullen gray expanse\r\nof fifty-inch hardened steel armor, curving smoothly upward to a needle\r\nprow. Countless hundred of fine vertical scratches marred every inch\r\nof her surface, and here and there the stubborn metal was grooved and\r\nscored to a depth of inches--each scratch and score the record of an\r\nattempt of some wandering cosmic body to argue the right-of-way with\r\nthe stupendous mass of that man-made cruiser of the void.\r\n\r\nA burly young man made his way through the throng about the entrance,\r\nnodded unconcernedly to the gatekeeper, and joined the stream of\r\npassengers flowing through the triple doors of the double air-lock\r\nand down a corridor to the center of the vessel. However, instead of\r\nentering one of the elevators which were whisking the passengers up to\r\ntheir staterooms in the upper half of the enormous football, he in some\r\nway caused an opening to appear in an apparently blank steel wall and\r\nstepped through it into the control room.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Breck!\" the burly one called, as he strode up to the instrument-desk\r\nof the chief pilot and tossed his bag carelessly into a corner. \"Behold\r\nyour computer in the flesh! What's all this howl and fuss about poor\r\ncomputation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Steve!\" The chief pilot smiled as he shook hands cordially.\r\n\"Glad to see you again--but don't try to kid the old man. I'm simple\r\nenough to believe almost anything, but some things just aren't being\r\ndone. We have been yelling, and yelling hard, for trained computers\r\never since they started riding us about every one centimeter change in\r\nacceleration, but I know that you're no more an I-P computer than I am\r\na Digger Indian. They don't shoot sparrows with coast-defense guns!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the compliment, Breck, but I'm your computer for this trip,\r\nanyway. Newton, the good old egg, knows what you fellows are up against\r\nand is going to do something about it, if he has to lick all the rest of\r\nthe directors to do it. He knew that I was loose for a couple of weeks\r\nand asked me to come along this trip to see what I could see. I'm to\r\ncheck the observatory data--they don't know I'm aboard--take the peaks\r\nand valleys off your acceleration curve, if possible, and report to\r\nNewton just what I find out and what I think should be done about it.\r\nHow early am I?\" While the newcomer was talking, he had stripped the\r\ncovers from a precise scale model of the solar system and from a large\r\nand complicated calculating machine and had set to work without a wasted\r\nmotion or instant--scaling off upon the model the positions of the\r\nvarious check-stations and setting up long and involved integrals and\r\nequations upon the calculator.\r\n\r\nThe older man studied the broad back of the younger, bent over his\r\ncomputations, and a tender, almost fatherly smile came over his careworn\r\nface as he replied:\r\n\r\n\"Early? You? Just like you always were--plus fifteen seconds on the\r\ndeadline. The final dope is due right now.\" He plugged the automatic\r\nrecorder and speaker into a circuit marked \"Observatory,\" waited until\r\na tiny light above the plug flashed green, and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"IPV _Arcturus_; Breckenridge, Chief Pilot; trip number forty-three\r\ntwenty-nine. Ready for final supplementary route and flight data, Tellus\r\nto Mars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meteoric swarms still too numerous for safe travel along the scheduled\r\nroute,\" came promptly from the speaker. \"You must stay further away from\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic. The ether will be clear for you along route\r\nE2-P6-W41-K3-R19-S7-M14. You will hold a constant acceleration of 981.27\r\ncentimeters between initial and final check stations. Your take-off\r\nwill be practically unobstructed, but you will have to use the utmost\r\ncaution in landing upon Mars, because in order to avoid a weightless\r\ndetour and a loss of thirty-one minutes, you must pass very close\r\nto both the Martian satellites. To do so safely you must pass the\r\nlast meteorological station, M14, on schedule time plus or minus five\r\nseconds, at scheduled velocity plus or minus ten meters, with exactly\r\nthe given negative acceleration of 981.27 centimeters, and exactly upon\r\nthe pilot ray M14 will have set for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x.\" Breckenridge studied his triplex chronometer intently, then\r\nunplugged and glanced around the control room, in various parts of which\r\nhalf a dozen assistants were loafing at their stations.\r\n\r\n\"Control and power check-out--Hipe!\" he barked. \"Driving converters and\r\nprojectors!\"\r\n\r\nThe first assistant scanned his meters narrowly as he swung a\r\nmulti-point switch in a flashing arc. \"Converter efficiency 100,\r\nprojector reactivity 100; on each of numbers one to forty-five\r\ninclusive. All x.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dirigible projectors!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTwo more gleaming switches leaped from point to point. \"Converter\r\nefficiency 100, projector reactivity 100, dirigibility 100, on each of\r\nnumbers one to thirty-two, inclusive, of upper band; and numbers one to\r\nthirty-two, inclusive, of lower band. All x.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gyroscopes!\"\r\n\r\n\"35,000. Drivers in equilibrium at ten degrees plus. All x.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upper lights and lookout plates!\"\r\n\r\nThe second assistant was galvanized into activity, and upon a screen\r\nbefore him there appeared a view as though he were looking directly\r\nupward from the prow of the great vessel. The air above them was full of\r\naircraft of all shapes and sizes, and occasionally the image of one of\r\nthat flying horde flared into violet splendor upon the screen as it was\r\ncaught in the mighty, roving beam of one of the twelve ultra-light\r\nprojectors under test.\r\n\r\n\"Upper lights and lookout plates--all x,\" the second assistant reported,\r\nand other assistants came to attention as the check-out went on.\r\n\r\n\"Lower lights and lookout plates!\"\r\n\r\n\"All x,\" was the report, after each of the twelve ultra-lights of the\r\nstern had swung around in its supporting brackets, illuminating every\r\nrecess of the dark depths of the bottom well of the berth and throwing\r\nthe picture upon another screen in lurid violet relief.\r\n\r\n\"Lateral and vertical detectors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Laterals XP2710--all x. Verticals AJ4290--all x.\"\r\n\r\n\"Receptors!\"\r\n\r\n\"15,270 kilofranks--all x.\"\r\n\r\n\"Accumulators!\"\r\n\r\n\"700,000 kilofrank-hours--all x.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus checked and tested every function of his department,\r\nBreckenridge plugged into \"Captain,\" and when the green light went on:\r\n\r\n\"Chief pilot check-out--all x,\" he reported briefly.\r\n\r\n\"All x,\" acknowledged the speaker, and the chief pilot unplugged.\r\nFifteen minutes remained, during which time one department head after\r\nanother would report to the captain of the liner that everything in his\r\ncharge was ready for the stupendous flight.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Steve?\" Breckenridge turned to the computer. \"How do you check\r\nacceleration and power with the observatory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so good, old bean,\" the younger man frowned in thought. \"They\r\nfigure like astronomers, not navigators. They've made no allowances for\r\nanything, not even the reversal--and I figure four thousands for that\r\nand for minor detours. Then there's check station errors....\"\r\n\r\n\"Check-station errors! Why, they're always right--that's what they're\r\nfor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't fool yourself--they've got troubles of their own, the same as\r\nanybody else. In fact, from a study of the charts of the last few weeks,\r\nI'm pretty sure that E2 is at least four thousand kilometers this side\r\nof where he thinks he is, that W41 is ten or twelve thousand beyond his\r\nstation, and that they've both got a lateral displacement that's simply\r\nfierce. I'm going to check up, and argue with them about it as we pass.\r\nThen there's another thing--they figure to only two places, and we've\r\ngot to have the third place almost solid if we expect to get a smooth\r\ncurve. A hundredth of a centimeter of acceleration means a lot on a long\r\ntrip when they're holding us as close as they are doing now. We'll ride\r\nthis trip on 981.286 centimeters--with our scheduled mass, that means\r\nthirty six points of four seven kilofranks _plus_ equilibrium power. All\r\nset to go,\" the computer stated, as he changed, by fractions of arc, the\r\ncourse-plotters of the automatic integrating goniometer.\r\n\r\n\"You're the doctor--but I'm glad it's you that'll have to explain to the\r\nobservatory,\" and Breckenridge set his exceedingly delicate excess power\r\npotentiometer exactly upon the indicated figure. \"Well, we've got a few\r\nminutes left for a chin-chin before we lift her off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's all this commotion about? Dish out the low-down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's like this, Steve. We pilots are having one sweet\r\ntime--we're being growled at on every trip. The management squawks if\r\nwe're thirty seconds plus or minus at the terminals, and the passenger\r\ndepartment squalls if we change acceleration five centimeters total en\r\nroute--claims it upsets the dainty customers and loses business for\r\nthe road. They're tightening up on us all the time. A couple of years\r\nago, you remember, it didn't make any difference what we did with the\r\nacceleration as long as we checked in somewhere near zero time--we used\r\nto spin 'em dizzy when we reversed at the half-way station--but that\r\nkind of stuff doesn't go any more. We've got to hold the acceleration\r\nconstant and close to normal, got to hold our schedule on zero, _plus_\r\nor _minus_ ten seconds, and yet we've got to make any detours they\r\ntell us to, such as this seven-million kilometer thing they handed\r\nus just now. To make things worse, we've got to take orders at every\r\ncheck-station, and yet _we_ get the blame for everything that happens\r\nas a consequence of obeying those orders! Of course, I know as well\r\nas you do that it's rotten technique to change acceleration at every\r\ncheck-station; but we've told 'em over and over that we can't do any\r\nbetter until they put a real computer on every ship and tell the\r\ncheck-stations to report meteorites and other obstructions to us and\r\nthen to let us alone. So you'd better recommend us some computers!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're getting rotten computation, that's a sure thing, and I don't\r\nblame you pilots for yelling, but I don't believe that you've got the\r\nright answer. I can't help but think that the astronomers are lying down\r\non the job. They are so sure that you pilots are to blame that it hasn't\r\noccurred to them to check up on themselves very carefully. However,\r\nwe'll know pretty quick, and then we'll take steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so--but say, Steve, I'm worried about using that much plus\r\nequilibrium power. Remember, we've got to hit M14 in absolutely good\r\nshape, or plenty heads will drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say they will. I know just how the passengers will howl if we\r\nhold them weightless for half an hour, waiting for those two moons to get\r\nout of the way, and I know just what the manager will do if we check in\r\nminus thirty-one minutes. Wow! He'll swell up and bust, sure. But don't\r\nworry, Breck--if we don't check in all right, anybody can have my head\r\nthat wants it, and I'm taking full responsibility, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome to it.\" Breckenridge shrugged and turned the\r\nconversation into a lighter vein. \"Speaking of weightlessness,\r\nit's funny how many weight-fiends there are in the world, isn't\r\nit? You'd think the passengers would enjoy a little weightlessness\r\noccasionally--especially the fat ones--but they don't. But say, while\r\nI think of it, how come you were here and loose to make this check-up?\r\nI thought you were out with the other two of the Big Three, solving\r\nall the mysteries of the Universe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had to stay in this last trip--been doing some work on the ether,\r\nforce-field theory, and other advanced stuff that I had to go to Mars\r\nand Venus to get. Just got back last week. As for solving mysteries,\r\nlaugh while you can, old hyena. You and a lot of other dim bulbs think\r\nthat Roeser's Rays are the last word--that there's nothing left to\r\ndiscover--are going to get jarred loose from your hinges one of these\r\ndays. When I came in nine months ago they were hot on the trail of\r\nsomething big, and I'll bet they bring it in....\"\r\n\r\nOut upon the dock an insistent siren blared a crescendo and diminuendo\r\nblast of sound, and two minutes remained. In every stateroom and in\r\nevery lounge and saloon speakers sounded a warning:\r\n\r\n\"For a short time, while we are pulling clear of the gravitational field\r\nof the Earth, walking will be somewhat difficult, as everything on board\r\nwill apparently increase in weight by about one-fifth of its present\r\namount. Please remain seated, or move about with caution. In about an\r\nhour weight will gradually return to normal. We start in one minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hipe!\" barked the chief pilot as a flaring purple light sprang into\r\nbeing upon his board, and the assistants came to attention at their\r\nstations. \"Seconds! Four! Three! Two! One! LIFT!\" He touched a\r\nbutton and a set of plunger switches drove home, releasing into the\r\nforty-five enormous driving projectors the equilibrium power--the\r\nfifteen-thousand-and-odd kilofranks of energy that exactly\r\ncounterbalanced the pull of gravity upon the mass of the cruiser.\r\nSimultaneously there was added from the potentiometer, already set\r\nto the exact figure given by the computer, the _plus_-equilibrium\r\npower--which would not be changed throughout the journey if the ideal\r\nacceleration curve were to be registered upon the recorders--and the\r\nimmense mass of the cruiser of the void wafted vertically upward at a\r\nlow and constant velocity. The bellowing, shrieking siren had cleared\r\nthe air magically of the swarm of aircraft in her path, and quietly,\r\ncalmly, majestically, the _Arcturus_ floated upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBreckenridge, sixty seconds after the initial lift, actuated the system\r\nof magnetic relays which would gradually cut in the precisely measured\r\n\"starting power,\" which it would be necessary to employ for sixty-nine\r\nminutes--for, without the acceleration given by this additional power,\r\nthey would lose many precious hours of time in covering merely the\r\nfew thousands of miles during which Earth's attraction would operate\r\npowerfully against their progress.\r\n\r\nFaster and faster the great cruiser shot upward as more and more of the\r\nstarting power was released, and heavier and heavier the passengers\r\nfelt themselves become. Soon the full calculated power was on and the\r\nacceleration became constant. Weight no longer increased, but remained\r\nconstant at a value of plus twenty three and six-tenths percent. For a\r\nfew moments there had been uneasy stomachs among the passengers--perhaps\r\na few of the first-trippers had been made ill--but it was not much worse\r\nthan riding in a high-speed elevator, particularly since there was no\r\nchange from positive to negative acceleration such as is experienced in\r\nexpress elevators.\r\n\r\nThe computer, his calculations complete, watched the pilot with\r\ninterest, for, accustomed as he was to traversing the depths of space,\r\nthere was a never-failing thrill to his scientific mind in the delicacy\r\nand precision of the work which Breckenridge was doing--work which could\r\nbe done only by a man who had had long training in the profession and\r\nwho was possessed of instantaneous nervous reaction and of the highest\r\ndegree of manual dexterity and control. Under his right and left hands\r\nwere the double-series potentiometers actuating the variable-speed\r\ndrives of the flight-angle directors in the hour and declination ranges;\r\nbefore his eyes was the finely marked micrometer screen upon which the\r\nguiding goniometer threw its needle-point of light; powerful optical\r\nsystems of prisms and lenses revealed to his sight the director-angles,\r\ndown to fractional seconds of arc. It was the task of the chief pilot\r\nto hold the screened image of the cross-hairs of the two directors in\r\nsuch position relative to the ever-moving point of light as to hold the\r\nmighty vessel precisely upon its course, in spite of the complex system\r\nof forces acting upon it.\r\n\r\nFor almost an hour Breckenridge sat motionless, his eyes flashing from\r\nmicrometer screen to signal panel, his sensitive fingers moving the\r\npotentiometers through minute arcs because of what he saw upon the\r\nscreen and in instantaneous response to the flashing, multi-colored\r\nlights and tinkling signals of his board. Finally, far from earth, the\r\nmoon's attraction and other perturbing forces comparatively slight, the\r\nsignals no longer sounded and the point of light ceased its irregular\r\nmotion, becoming almost stationary. The chief pilot brought both\r\ncross-hairs directly upon the brilliant point, which for some time they\r\nhad been approaching more and more nearly, adjusted the photo-cells\r\nand amplifiers which would hold them immovably upon it, and at the\r\ncalculated second of time, cut out the starting power by means of\r\nanother set of automatically timed relays. When only the regular driving\r\npower was left, and the acceleration had been checked and found to be\r\nexactly the designated value of 981.286 centimeters, he stood up and\r\nheaved a profound sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Steve, that's over with--we're on our way. I'm always glad when\r\nthis part of it is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a ticklish job, no fooling--even for an expert,\" the mathematician\r\nagreed. \"No wonder the astronomers think you birds are the ones who are\r\ngumming up their dope. Well, it's about time to plug in on E2. Here's\r\nwhere the fireworks start!\" He closed the connections which transferred\r\nthe central portion of the upper lookout screen to a small micrometer\r\nscreen at Breckenridge's desk and plugged it into the first\r\ncheck-station. Instantly a point of red light, surrounded by a vivid\r\norange circle, appeared upon the screen, low down and to the left of\r\ncenter, and the timing galvanometer showed a wide positive deflection.\r\n\r\n\"Hashed again!\" growled Breckenridge. \"I must be losing my grip,\r\nI guess. I put everything I had on that sight, and missed it ten\r\ndivisions. I think I'll turn in my badge--I've cocked our perfect curve\r\nalready, before we got to the first check-station!\" His hands moved\r\ntoward the controls, to correct their course and acceleration.\r\n\r\n\"As you were--hold everything! Lay off those controls!\" snapped the\r\ncomputer. \"There's something screwy, just as I thought--and it isn't\r\nyou, either. I'm no pilot, of course, but I do know good compensation\r\nwhen I see it, and if you weren't compensating that point I never saw it\r\ndone. Besides, with your skill and my figures I know darn well that we\r\naren't off more than a tenth of one division. He's cuckoo! Don't call\r\nhim--let him start it, and refer him to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--I'll be only too glad to pass the buck. But I still think,\r\nSteve, that you're playing with dynamite. Who ever heard of an\r\nastronomer being wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd be surprised,\" grinned the physicist, \"Since this fuss has\r\njust started, nobody has tried to find out whether they were wrong\r\nor not....\"\r\n\r\n\"IPV _Arcturus_, attention!\" came from the speaker curtly.\r\n\r\n\"IPV _Arcturus_, Breckenridge,\" from the chief pilot.\r\n\r\n\"You have been on my ray almost a minute. Why are you not correcting\r\ncourse and acceleration?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Stevens is computing us and has full control of course and\r\nacceleration,\" replied Breckenridge. \"He will answer you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am changing neither course nor acceleration because you are not\r\nin position,\" declared Stevens, crisply, \"Please give me your present\r\nsupposed location, and your latest precision goniometer bearings on the\r\nsun, the moon, Mars, Venus, and your Tellurian reference limb, with\r\nexact time of observations, gyroscope zero-planes, and goniometer\r\nfactors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Correct at once or I shall report you to the Observatory,\" E2 answered\r\nloftily, paying no attention to the demand for proof of position.\r\n\r\n\"Be sure you do that, guy--and while you're at it report that your\r\nstation hasn't taken a precision bearing in a month. Report that you've\r\nbeen muddling along on radio loop bearings, and that you don't know\r\nwhere you are, within seven thousand kilometers. And speaking of\r\nreporting--I know already that a lot of you astronomical guessers\r\nhave only the faintest possible idea of where you really are, _plus_,\r\n_minus_, or lateral; and if you don't get yourselves straightened out\r\nbefore we get to W41, I'm going to make a report on my own account that\r\nwill jar some of you birds loose from your upper teeth!\" He unplugged\r\nwith a vicious jerk, and turned to the pilot with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"Guess that'll hold him for a while, won't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll report us, sure,\" remonstrated Breckenridge. The older man was\r\nplainly ill at ease at this open defiance of the supposedly infallible\r\ncheck-stations.\r\n\r\n\"Not that baby,\" returned the computer confidently. \"I'll bet you a\r\nsmall farm against a plugged nickel that right now he's working his\r\ngoniometer so hard that it's pivots are getting hot. He'll sneak back\r\ninto position as soon as he can calculate his results, and pretend he's\r\nalways been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"The others will be all right, then, probably, by the time we get to\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, no--you're unusually dumb today, Breck. He won't tell anybody\r\nanything--he doesn't want to be the only goat, does he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see. How could you dope this out, with only the recorder charts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I know the kind of stuff you pilots are--and those humps are\r\naltogether too big to be accounted for by anything I know about you.\r\nAnother thing--the next station, P6, I think is keeping himself all x.\r\nIf so, when you corrected for E2, which was wrong, it'd throw you all\r\noff on P6, which was right, and so on--a bad hump at almost every\r\ncheck-station. See?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrue to prediction, the pilot ray of P6 came in almost upon the exact\r\ncenter of the micrometer screen, and Breckenridge smiled in relief as he\r\nbegan really to enjoy the trip.\r\n\r\n\"How do we check on chronometers?\" asked P6 when Stevens had been\r\nintroduced. \"By my time you seem to be about two and a half seconds\r\n_plus_?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--two points four seconds plus--we're riding on 981.286\r\ncentimeters, to allow for the reversal and for minor detours. Bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this may have been coincidence, Breck, but we'll find out pretty\r\nquick now,\" the computer remarked when the flying vessel was nearing\r\nthe third check-station. \"Unless I'm all out of control we'll check in\r\nalmost fourteen seconds minus on W41, and we may not even find him on\r\nthe center block of the screen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he plugged in W41 was on the block, but was in the extreme upper\r\nright corner. They checked in thirteen and eight-tenths seconds minus on\r\nthe station, and a fiery dialogue ensued when the computer questioned\r\nthe accuracy of the location of the station and refused point-blank to\r\ncorrect his course.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Breck, old onion, that tears it,\" Stevens declared as he\r\nunplugged. \"No use going any further on these bum reference points.\r\nI'm going to report to Newton--he'll rock the Observatory on its\r\nfoundations!\" He plugged into the telegraph room. \"Have you got a free\r\nhigh-power wave?... Please put me on Newton, in the main office.\"\r\n\r\nMoving lights flashed and flickered for an instant upon the communicator\r\nscreen, settling down into a white glow which soon resolved itself into\r\nthe likeness of a keen-eyed, gray-haired man, seated at his desk in the\r\nremote office of the Interplanetary Corporation. Newton smiled as he\r\nrecognized the likeness of Stevens upon his own screen, and greeted him\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\n\"Have you started your investigation, Doctor Stevens?\"\r\n\r\n\"Started it? I've finished it!\" and Stevens tersely reported what he\r\nhad learned, concluding: \"So you see, you don't need special computers\r\non these ships any more than a hen needs teeth. You've got all the\r\ncomputers you need, in the observatories--all you've got to do is make\r\nthem work at their trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"The piloting was all x, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely--our curve so far is exactly flat ever since we cut\r\noff the starting power. Of course, all the pilots can't be as good as\r\nBreckenridge, but give them good computation and good check points and\r\nyou shouldn't get any humps higher than about half a centimeter.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll get both, from now on,\" the director assured him. \"Thanks. If\r\nyour work for the trip is done, you might show my little girl, Nadia,\r\naround the _Arcturus_. She's never been out before, and will be\r\ninterested. Would you mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad to, Mr. Newton--I'll be a regular uncle to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks again, Operator, I'll speak to Captain King, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pipe down that guff, you unlicked cub, or I'll crown you with a\r\nproof-bar!\" the chief pilot growled, as soon as Stevens had unplugged.\r\n\r\n\"You and who else?\" retorted the computer, cheerfully. \"Pipe down\r\nyourself, guy--if you weren't so darn dumb and didn't have such a\r\ncomplex, you'd know that you're the crack pilot of the outfit and\r\nwouldn't care who else knew it.\" Stevens carefully covered and put away\r\nthe calculating machine and other apparatus he had been using and turned\r\nagain to the pilot.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know Newton had any kids, especially little ones, or I'd have\r\ngot acquainted with them long ago. Of course I don't know him very well,\r\nsince I never was around the office much, but the old tiger goes over\r\nbig with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm--m. Think you'll enjoy playing nursemaid all the rest of the trip?\"\r\nBreckenridge asked caustically, but with an enigmatic smile.\r\n\r\n\"Think so? I _know_ so!\" replied Stevens, positively. \"I always did\r\nlike kids, and they always did like me--we fall for each other like ten\r\nthousand bricks falling down a well. Why, a kid--_any_ kid--and I team\r\nup just like grace and poise.... What's gnawing on you anyway, to make\r\nyou turn Cheshire cat all of a sudden? By the looks of that grin I'd\r\nsay you had swallowed a canary of mine some way or other; but darned if\r\nI know that I've lost any,\" and he stared at his friend suspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"To borrow your own phrase, Steve, 'You'd be surprised,'\" and\r\nBreckenridge, though making no effort to conceal his amusement, would\r\nsay no more.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the door opened, and through it there stepped a\r\ngrizzled four-striper. Almost hidden behind his massive form there was\r\na girl, who ran up to Breckenridge and seized both his hands, her eyes\r\nsparkling.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Breckie, you old darling! I knew that if we both kept after\r\nhim long enough Dad would let me ride with you sometime. Isn't this\r\n_gorgeous_?\"\r\n\r\nStevens was glad indeed that the girl's enthusiastic greeting of the\r\npilot was giving him time to recover from his shock, for Director\r\nNewton's \"little girl, Nadia\" was not precisely what he had led himself\r\nto expect. Little she might be, particularly when compared with the\r\ngiant frame of Captain King, or with Steve's own five-feet-eleven of\r\nstature and the hundred and ninety pounds of rawhide and whalebone that\r\nwas his body, but child she certainly was not. Her thick, fair hair,\r\ncut in the square bob that was the mode of the moment, indicated that\r\nNature had intended her to be a creamy blonde, but as she turned to be\r\nintroduced to him, Stevens received another surprise--for she was one\r\nof those rare, but exceedingly attractive beings, a natural blonde with\r\nbrown eyes and black eyebrows. Sun and wind had tanned her satin skin\r\nto a smooth and even shade of brown, and every movement of her lithe and\r\nsupple body bespoke to the discerning mind a rigidly-trained physique.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Stevens, you haven't met Miss Newton, I hear,\" the captain\r\nintroduced them informally. \"All the officers who are not actually tied\r\ndown at their posts are anxious to do the honors of the vessel, but as\r\nI have received direct orders from the owners, I am turning her over to\r\nyou--you are to show her around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Captain, I won't mutiny a bit against such an order. I'm mighty\r\nglad to know you, Miss Newton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard a lot about you, Doctor. Dad and Breckie here are always\r\ntalking about the Big Three--what you have done and what you are going\r\nto do. I want to meet Doctor Brandon and Doctor Westfall, too,\" and her\r\nhand met his in a firm and friendly clasp. She turned to the captain,\r\nand Stevens, noticing that the pilot, with a quizzical expression, was\r\nabout to say something, silenced him with a fierce aside.\r\n\r\n\"Clam it, ape, or I'll climb up you like a squirrel!\" he hissed, and the\r\ngrinning Breckenridge nodded assent to this demand for silence\r\nconcerning children and nursemaids.\r\n\r\n\"Since you've never been out, Miss Newton, you'll want to see the whole\r\nworks,\" Stevens addressed the girl. \"Where do you want to begin? Shall\r\nwe start at the top and work down?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right with me,\" she agreed, and fell into step beside him. She was\r\ndressed in dove-gray from head to foot--toque, blouse, breeches, heavy\r\nstockings, and shoes were of the one shade of smooth, lustrous silk; and\r\nas they strolled together down the passage-way, the effortless ease and\r\nperfect poise of her carriage called aloud to every hard-schooled fibre\r\nof his own highly-trained being.\r\n\r\n\"We're a lot alike you and I--do you know it?\" he asked, abruptly and\r\nunconventionally.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I've felt it, too,\" she replied frankly, and studied him without\r\naffectation. \"It has just come to me what it is. We're both in fine\r\ncondition and in hard training. You're an athlete of some kind, and I'm\r\nsure you're a star--I ought to recognize you, but I'm ashamed to say I\r\ndon't. What do you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course--Stevens, the great Olympic high and fancy diver! I would\r\n_never_ have connected our own Doctor Stevens, the eminent mathematical\r\nphysicist, with the King of the Springboard. Say, ever since I quit\r\nbeing afraid of the water I've had a yen to do that two-and-a-half twist\r\nof yours, but I never met anybody who knew it well enough to teach it\r\nto me, and I've almost broken my back forty times trying to learn it\r\nalone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got you, now, too--American and British Womens' golf champion.\r\nShake!\" and the two shook hands vigorously, in mutual congratulation.\r\n\"Tell you what--I'll give you some pointers on diving, and you can show\r\nme how to make a golf ball behave. Next to Norman Brandon, I've got\r\nthe most vicious hook in captivity--and Norm can't help himself. He's\r\nleft-handed, you know, and, being a southpaw, he's naturally wild. He\r\nslices all his woods and hooks all his irons. I'm consistent, anyway--I\r\nhook everything, even my putts.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bargain! What do you shoot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty dubby. Usually in the middle eighties--none of us play much,\r\nbeing out in space most of the time, you know--sometimes, when my hook\r\nis going particularly well, I go up into the nineties.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll lick that hook,\" she promised, as they entered an elevator and\r\nwere borne upward, toward the prow of the great interplanetary cruiser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n----But Does Not Arrive\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All out--we climb the rest of the way on foot,\" Stevens told his\r\ncompanion, as the elevator stopped at the uppermost passenger floor.\r\nThey walked across the small circular hall and the guard on duty came\r\nto attention and saluted as they approached him.\r\n\r\n\"I have orders to pass you and Miss Newton, sir. Do you know all the\r\ncombinations?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know this good old tub better than the men that built her--I helped\r\ncalculate her,\" Stevens replied, as he stepped up to an apparently blank\r\nwall of steel and deftly manipulated an almost invisible dial set flush\r\nwith its surface. \"This is to keep the passengers where they belong,\" he\r\nexplained, as a section of the wall swung backward in a short arc and\r\nslid smoothly aside. \"We will now proceed to see what makes it tick.\"\r\n\r\nLadder after ladder of steel they climbed, and bulkhead after bulkhead\r\nopened at Stevens's knowing touch. At each floor the mathematician\r\nexplained to the girl the operation of the machinery there automatically\r\nat work--devices for heating and cooling, devices for circulating,\r\nmaintaining, and purifying the air and the water--in short, all the\r\ncomplex mechanism necessary for the comfort and convenience of the human\r\ncargo of the liner.\r\n\r\nSoon they entered the conical top compartment, a room scarcely fifteen\r\nfeet in diameter, tapering sharply upward to a hollow point some\r\ntwenty feet above them. The true shape of the room, however, was not\r\nimmediately apparent, because of the enormous latticed beams and\r\ngirders which braced the walls in every direction. The air glowed\r\nwith the violet light of the twelve great ultra-light projectors, like\r\nsearchlights with three-foot lenses, which lined the wall. The floor\r\nbeneath their feet was not a level steel platform, but seemed to be\r\ncomposed of many lenticular sections of dull blue alloy.\r\n\r\n\"We are standing upon the upper lookout lenses, aren't we?\" asked the\r\ngirl. \"Is that perfectly all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. They're so hard that nothing can scratch them, and of course\r\nRoeser's Rays go right through our bodies, or any ordinary substance,\r\nlike a bullet through a hole in a Swiss cheese. Even those lenses\r\nwouldn't deflect them if they weren't solid fields of force.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, one of the ultra-lights flashed around in a short, quick\r\narc, and the girl saw that instead of the fierce glare she had expected,\r\nit emitted only a soft violet light. Nevertheless she dodged\r\ninvoluntarily and Stevens touched her arm reassuringly.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Miss Newton--they're as harmless as mice. They hardly ever have\r\nto swing past the vertical, and even if one shines right through you you\r\ncan look it right in the eye as long as you want to--it can't hurt you\r\na bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No ultra-violet at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever. Just a color--one of the many remaining crudities of our\r\nultra-light vision. A lot of good men are studying this thing of direct\r\nvision, though, and it won't be long before we have a system that will\r\nreally work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's all perfectly wonderful!\" she breathed. \"Just think of\r\ntraveling in comfort through empty space, and of actually seeing through\r\nseamless steel walls, without even a sign of a window! How can such\r\nthings be possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to go pretty well back,\" he warned, \"and any adequate\r\nexplanation is bound to be fairly deep wading in spots. How technical\r\ncan you stand it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can go down with you middling deep--I took a lot of general science,\r\nand physics through advanced mechanics. Of course, I didn't get into any\r\nsuch highly specialized stuff as sub-electronics or Roeser's Rays, but\r\nif you start drowning me, I'll yell.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's fine--you can get the idea all x, with that to go on. Let's sit\r\ndown here on this girder. Roeser didn't do it all, by any means, even\r\nthough he got credit for it--he merely helped the Martians do it. The\r\nwhole thing started, of course, when Goddard shot his first rocket to\r\nthe moon, and was intensified when Roeser so perfected his short waves\r\nthat signals were exchanged with Mars--signals that neither side could\r\nmake any sense out of. Goddard's pupils and followers made bigger and\r\nbetter rockets, and finally got one that could land safely upon Mars.\r\nRoeser, who was a mighty keen bird, was one of the first voyagers, and\r\nhe didn't come back--he stayed there, living in a space-suit for three\r\nor four years, and got a brand-new education. Martian science always\r\nwas hot, you know, but they were impractical. They were desperately\r\nhard up for water and air, and while they had a lot of wonderful\r\nideas and theories, they couldn't overcome the practical technical\r\ndifficulties in the way of making their ideas work. Now putting other\r\npeoples' ideas to work was Roeser's long suit--don't think that I'm\r\nbelittling Roeser at all, either, for he was a brave and far-sighted\r\nman, was no mean scientist, and was certainly one of the best organizers\r\nand synchronizers the world has ever known--and since Martian and\r\nTellurian science complemented each other, so that one filled in the\r\ngaps of the other, it wasn't long until fleets of space-freighters were\r\nbringing in air and water from Venus, which had more of both than she\r\nneeded or wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Having done all he could for the Martians and having learned most of\r\nthe stuff he wanted to know, Roeser came back to Tellus and organized\r\nInterplanetary, with scientists and engineers on all three planets,\r\nand set to work to improve the whole system, for the vessels they used\r\nthen were dangerous--regular mankillers, in fact. At about this same\r\ntime Roeser and the Interplanetary Corporation had a big part in the\r\nunification of the world into one nation, so that wars could no longer\r\ninterfere with progress.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"With this introduction I can get down to fundamentals. Molecules are\r\nparticles of the first order, and vibrations of the first order include\r\nsound, light, heat, electricity, radio, and so on. Second order,\r\natoms--extremely short vibrations, such as hard X-rays. Third order,\r\nelectrons and protons, with their accompanying Millikan, or cosmic,\r\nrays. Fourth order, sub-electrons and sub-protons. These, in the\r\nmaterial aspect, are supposed to be the particles of the fourth order,\r\nand in the energy aspect they are known as Roeser's Rays. That is, these\r\nfourth-order rays and particles seem to partake of the nature of both\r\nenergy and matter. Following me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right behind you,\" she assured him. She had been listening intently,\r\nher wide-spaced brown eyes fastened upon his face.\r\n\r\n\"Since these Roeser's Rays, or particles or rays of the fourth order,\r\nseem to be both matter and energy, and since the rays can be converted\r\ninto what is supposed to be the particles, they have been thought to be\r\nthe things from which both electrons and protons were built. Therefore,\r\neverybody except Norman Brandon has supposed them the ultimate units of\r\ncreation, so that it would be useless to try to go any further....\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we were taught that they _are_ the ultimate units!\" she protested.\r\n\r\n\"I know you were--but we really don't know anything, except what we\r\nhave learned empirically, even about our driving forces. What is called\r\nthe fourth-order particle is absolutely unknown, since nobody has been\r\nable to detect it, to say nothing of determining its velocity or other\r\nproperties. It has been assumed to have the velocity of light only\r\nbecause that hypothesis does not conflict with observational data. I'm\r\ngoing to give you the generally accepted idea, since we have nothing\r\ndefinite to offer in its place, but I warn you that that idea is very\r\nprobably wrong. There's a lot of deep stuff down there hasn't been dug\r\nup yet. In fact, Brandon thinks that the product of conversion isn't\r\nwhat we think it is, at all--that the actual fundamental unit and the\r\nprimary mechanism of the transformation lie somewhere below the fourth\r\norder, and possibly even below the level of the ether--but we haven't\r\nbeen able to find a point of attack yet that will let us get in\r\nanywhere. However, I'm getting 'way ahead of our subject. To get back to\r\nit, energy can be converted into something that acts like matter through\r\nRoeser's Rays, and that is the empirical fact underlying the drive of\r\nour space-ships, as well as that of almost all other vehicles on all\r\nthree planets. Power is generated by the great waterfalls of Tellus and\r\nVenus--water's mighty scarce on Mars, of course, so most of our plants\r\nthere use fuel--and is transmitted on light beams, by means of powerful\r\nfields of force to the receptors, wherever they may be. The individual\r\ntransmitting fields and receptors are really simply matched-frequency\r\nunits, each matching the electrical characteristics of some particular\r\nand unique beam of force. This beam is composed of Roeser's Rays, in\r\ntheir energy aspect. It took a long time to work out this tight-beam\r\ntransmission of power, but it was fairly simple after they got it.\"\r\n\r\nHe took out a voluminous notebook, at the sight of which Nadia smiled.\r\n\r\n\"A computer might forget to dress, but you'd never catch one without a\r\nfull magazine pencil and a lot of blank paper,\" he grinned in reply and\r\nwent on, writing as he talked.\r\n\r\n\"For any given frequency, _f_, and phase angle, _theta_, you integrate,\r\nbetween limits zero and _pi_ divided by two, sine theta d....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold it--I'm sinking!\" Nadia exclaimed. \"I don't integrate at all\r\nunless it is absolutely necessary. As long as you stick to general\r\nscience, I'm right on your heels, but please lay off of integrations\r\nand all that--most especially stay away from those terrible electrical\r\nintegrations. I always did think that they were the most poisonous kind\r\nknown. I want only a general idea--that's all that I can understand,\r\nanyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I forgot--guess I was getting in deeper than is necessary,\r\nespecially since this whole thing of beam transmission is pretty crude\r\nyet and is bound to change a lot before long. There is so much loss\r\nthat when we get more than a few hundred million kilometers away from\r\na power-plant we lose reception entirely. But to get going again,\r\nthe receptors receive the beam and from them the power is sent to the\r\naccumulators, where it is stored. These accumulators are an outgrowth\r\nof the storage battery. The theory of the accumulator is....\"\r\n\r\n\"Lay off the theory, please!\" the listener interrupted. \"I understand\r\nperfectly without it. Energy is stored in the accumulators--you put it\r\nin and take it out. That's all that is necessary.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to give you some of the theory--but, after all, it wouldn't\r\nadd much to your understanding of the working of things, and it might\r\nmix you up, as some of it is pretty deep stuff. Then, too, it would\r\ntake a lot of time, and the rest of your friends would squawk if I\r\nkept you here indefinitely. From the accumulators, then, the power\r\nis fed to the converters, each of which is backed by a projector.\r\nThe converters simply change the aspect of the rays, from the\r\nenergy aspect to the material aspect. As soon as this is done, the\r\nhighly-charged particles--or whatever they are--thus formed are\r\nrepelled by the terrific stationary force maintained in the projector\r\nbacking the converter. Each particle departs with a velocity supposed\r\nto be that of light, and the recoil upon the projector drives the\r\nvessel, or car, or whatever it is attached to. Still with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Struggling a little, but my nose is still above the surface. These\r\nparticles, being so infinitesimally small that they cannot even be\r\ndetected, go right through any substance without any effect--they are\r\nnot even harmful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Now we are in position to go ahead with the lights, detectors,\r\nand so on. The energy aspect of the rays you can best understand as\r\nsimply a vibration in the ether--an extremely high frequency one.\r\nWhile not rigidly scientific, that is close enough for you and me.\r\nNobody knows what the stuff really is, and it cannot be explained or\r\ndemonstrated by any model or concept in three-dimensional space. Its\r\nphysical-mathematical interpretation, the only way in which it can be\r\ngrasped at all, requires sixteen coordinates in four dimensions, and\r\nI don't suppose you'd care to go into that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say I wouldn't!\" she exclaimed, feelingly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway, by the use of suitable fields of force it can be used\r\nas a carrier wave. Most of this stuff of the fields of force--how to\r\ncarry the modulation up and down through all the frequency changes\r\nnecessary--was figured out by the Martians ages ago. Used as a pure\r\ncarrier wave, with a sender and a receiver at each end, it isn't so\r\nbad--that's why our communicator and radio systems work as well as they\r\ndo. They are pretty good, really, but the ultra-light vision system\r\nis something else again. Sending the heterodyned wave through steel\r\nis easy, but breaking it up, so as to view an object and return the\r\nimpulses, was an awful job and one that isn't half done yet. We see\r\nthings, after a fashion and at a distance of a few kilometers, by\r\nsending an almost parallel wave from a twin-projector to disintegrate\r\nand double back the viewing wave. That's the way the lookout plates and\r\nlenses work, all over the ship--from the master-screens in the control\r\nroom to the plates of the staterooms and lifeboats and the viewing-areas\r\nof the promenades. But the whole system is a rotten makeshift, and....\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute!\" exclaimed the girl. \"I and everybody else have been\r\nthinking that everything is absolutely perfect; and yet every single\r\nthing you have talked about, you have ended up by describing as\r\n'unknown,' 'rudimentary,' 'temporary,' or a 'makeshift.' You speak as\r\nthough the entire system were a poor thing that will have to do until\r\nsomething better has been found, and that nobody knows anything about\r\nanything! How do you get that way?\"\r\n\r\n\"By working with Brandon and Westfall. Those birds have got real brains\r\nand they're on the track of something that will, in all probability, be\r\nas far ahead of Roeser's Rays as our present system is ahead of the\r\nscience of the seventeenth century.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" she looked at him in astonishment. \"Tell me about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't be done,\" he refused. \"I don't know much about it--even they\r\ndidn't know any too much about some of it when I had to come in. And\r\nwhat little I do know I can't tell, because it isn't mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're working with them, aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in the sense that a small boy helps his father build a house.\r\nThey're the brains--I simply do some figuring that they don't want to\r\nwaste time doing.\"\r\n\r\nNadia, having no belief whatever in his modest disclaimer, but in secret\r\ngreatly pleased by his attitude, replied:\r\n\r\n\"Of course you couldn't say anything about an unfinished project--I\r\nshouldn't have asked. Where do we go from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down the lining of the hull, outside the passengers' quarters to the\r\nupper dirigible projectors,\" and he led the way down a series of steep\r\nsteel stairways, through bulkheads and partitions of steel. \"One thing\r\nI forgot to tell you about--the detectors. They're worked on the same\r\nprinciple as the lights, and are just about as efficient. Instead, of\r\nlight, though, they send out cones of electromagnetic waves, which set\r\nup induced currents in any conductor encountered beyond our own shell.\r\nSince all dangerous meteorites have been shown to contain conducting\r\nmaterial, that is enough to locate them, for radio finders automatically\r\ndetermine the direction, distance, and magnitude of the disturbance, and\r\nswing a light on it. That was what happened when that light swung toward\r\nus, back there in the prow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any of those life-boats, that I've heard discussed so much\r\nlately, near here?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of 'em--here's one right here,\" and at the next landing he opened\r\na vacuum-insulated steel door, snapped on a light, and waved his hand.\r\n\"You can't see much of it from here, but it's a complete space-ship\r\nin itself, capable of maintaining a dozen or fifteen persons during\r\na two-weeks' cruise in space.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why isn't it a good idea to retain them? Accidents are still possible,\r\nare they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, and there is no question of doing away with them entirely.\r\nModern ships, however, have only enough of them to take care of the\r\nlargest number of persons ever to be carried by the vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has the _Arcturus_ more than she needs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say she has, and more of everything else, except room for\r\npay-load.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard them talking about junking her. I think it's a shame.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I, in a way--you see, I helped design her and her sister-ship,\r\nthe _Sirius_, which Brandon and Westfall are using as a floating\r\nlaboratory. But times change, and the inefficient must go. She's a good\r\nold tub, but she was built when everybody was afraid of space, and we\r\nhad to put every safety factor into her that we could think of. As a\r\nresult, she is four times as heavy as she should be, and that takes a\r\nlot of extra power. Her skin is too thick. She has too many batteries of\r\naccumulators, too many life-boats, too many bulkheads and air-breaks,\r\ntoo many and too much of everything. She is so built that if she should\r\nbreak up out in space, nobody would die if they lived through the\r\nshock--there are so many bulkheads, air-breaks, and life-boats that\r\nno matter how many pieces she broke up into, the survivors would find\r\nthemselves in something able to navigate. That excessive construction\r\nis no longer necessary. Modern ships carry ten times the pay-load on\r\none-quarter of the power that this old battle-wagon uses. Even though\r\nshe's only four years old, she's a relic of the days when we used to\r\nslam through on the ecliptic route, right through all the meteoric\r\nstuff that is always there--trusting to heavy armor to ward off\r\nanything too small for the observers and detectors to locate. Now, with\r\nthe observatories and check-stations out in space, fairly light armor\r\nis sufficient, as we route ourselves well away from the ecliptic and so\r\nmiss all the heavy stuff. So, badly as I hate to see her go there, the\r\nold tub is bound for the junk-yard.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few more flights of stairs brought them to the upper band of dirigible\r\nprojectors, which encircled the hull outside the passengers' quarters,\r\nsome sixty feet below the prow. They were heavy, search-light-like\r\naffairs mounted upon massive universal bearings, free to turn in any\r\ndirection, and each having its converter nestling inside its prodigious\r\nfield of force. Stevens explained that these projectors were used in\r\nturning the vessel and in dodging meteorites when necessary, and they\r\nwent on through another almost invisible door into a hall and took an\r\nelevator down to the main corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've seen it, Miss Newton,\" Stevens said regretfully, as he\r\nled her toward the captain's office. \"The lower half is full of heavy\r\nstuff--accumulators, machinery, driving projectors, and such junk, so\r\nthat the center of gravity is below the center of action of the driving\r\nprojectors. That makes stable flight possible. It's all more or less\r\nlike what we've just seen, and I don't suppose you want to miss the\r\ndance--anyway, a lot of people want to dance with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you just as soon show me through the lower half as dance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather, lots!\"\r\n\r\n\"So would I. I can dance any time, and I want to see everything.\r\nLet's go!\"\r\n\r\nDown they went, past battery after battery of accumulators; climbing\r\nover and around the ever-increasing number of huge steel girders and\r\nbracers; through mazes of heavily insulated wiring and conduits; past\r\nmass after mass of automatic machinery which Stevens explained to his\r\neager listener. They inspected one of the great driving projectors,\r\nwhich, built rigidly parallel to the axis of the ship and held immovably\r\nin place by enormous trusses of steel, revealed neither to the eye nor\r\nto the ear any sign of the terrific force it was exerting. Still lower\r\nthey went, until the girl had been shown everything, even down to the\r\nbottom ultra-lights and stern braces.\r\n\r\n\"Tired?\" Stevens asked, as the inspection was completed.\r\n\r\n\"Not very. It's been quite a climb, but I've had a wonderful time.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I,\" he declared, positively. \"I know what--we'll crawl up into\r\none of these stern lifeboats and make us a cup of coffee before we climb\r\nback. With me?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Way ahead of you!\" Nadia accepted the invitation enthusiastically,\r\nand they made their way to the nearest of the miniature space-cruisers.\r\nHere, although no emergency had been encountered in all the four years\r\nof the vessel's life, they found everything in readiness, and the two\r\nsoon had prepared and eaten a hearty luncheon.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can't think of any more excuses for monopolizing you, Miss\r\nNewton, so I suppose I'll have to take you back. Believe me, I've\r\nenjoyed this more than you can realize--I've....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off and listened, every nerve taut. \"What was that?\" he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"What was what? I didn't hear anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Something screwy somewhere! I felt a vibration, and anything that'd\r\nmake this mountain of steel even quiver must have given us one\r\ngosh-awful nudge. There's another!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl, painfully tense, felt only a barely perceptible tremor, but\r\nthe computer, knowing far better than she the inconceivable strength and\r\nmass of that enormous structure of solidly braced hardened steel, sprang\r\ninto action. Leaping to the small dirigible look-out plate, he turned on\r\nthe power and swung it upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Great suffering snakes!\" he ejaculated, then stood mute, for the\r\nplate revealed a terrible sight. The entire nose of the gigantic craft\r\nhad been sheared off in two immense slices as though clipped off by a\r\ngigantic sword, and even as they stared, fascinated, at the sight, the\r\nsevered slices were drifting slowly away. Swinging the view along the\r\nplane of cleavage, Stevens made out a relatively tiny ball of metal,\r\nonly fifty feet or so in diameter, at a distance of perhaps a mile.\r\nFrom this ball there shot a blinding plane of light, and the _Arcturus_\r\nfell apart at the midsection, the lower half separating clean from\r\nthe upper portion, which held the passengers. Leaving the upper half\r\nintact, the attacker began slicing the lower, driving half into thin,\r\ndisk-shaped sections. As that incandescent plane of destruction made\r\nits first flashing cut through the body of the _Arcturus_, accompanied\r\nby an additional pyrotechnic display of severed and short-circuited\r\nhigh-tension leads, Stevens and Nadia suddenly found themselves floating\r\nweightless in the air of the room. Still gripping the controls of the\r\nlook-out plate, Stevens caught the white-faced girl with one hand, drew\r\nher down beside him, and held her motionless while his keen mind flashed\r\nover all the possibilities of the situation and planned his course\r\nof action.\r\n\r\n\"They're apparently slicing us pretty evenly, and by the looks of\r\nthings, one cut is coming right about here,\" he explained rapidly, as\r\nhe found a flashlight and drew his companion through the door and along\r\na narrow passage. Soon he opened another door and led her into a tiny\r\ncompartment so low that they could not stand upright--a mere cubicle of\r\nsteel. Carefully closing the door, he fingered dials upon each of the\r\nwalls of the cell, then folded himself up into a comfortable position,\r\ninstructed Nadia to do the same, and snapped off the light.\r\n\r\n\"Please leave it on,\" the shaken girl asked. \"It's so ghastly!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better save it, Nadia,\" he advised, pressing her arm reassuringly,\r\n\"it's the only light we've got, and we may need it worse later on--its\r\nlife is limited, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Later on? Do you think we'll need anything--later on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure! Of course they may get us, Nadia, but this little tertiary\r\nair-break is a mighty small target for them to hit. And if they miss us,\r\nas I think they will, there's a larger room opening off each wall of\r\nthis one--at least one of which will certainly be left intact. From any\r\none of those rooms we can reach a life-boat. Of course, it's a little\r\ntoo much to expect that any one of the life-boats will be left whole,\r\nbut they're bulkheaded, too, you know, so that we can be sure of finding\r\nsomething able to navigate--providing we can make our get-away. Believe\r\nme, ace, I'm sure glad we're aboard the old _Arcturus_ right now, with\r\nall her safety-devices, instead of on one of the modern liners. We'd be\r\nsunk right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I felt sunk enough for a minute--I'm feeling better now, though, since\r\nyou are taking it so calmly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--why not? A man's not dead until his heart stops beating, you\r\nknow--our turn'll come next, when they let up a little.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they change the width of their slices, and hit this cubby,\r\nsmall as it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"It'd be just too bad,\" he shrugged. \"In that case, we'd never know\r\nwhat hit us, so it's no good worrying about it. But say, we might do\r\nsomething at that, if they didn't hit us square. I can move fairly fast,\r\nand might be able to get a door open before the loss of pressure seals\r\nit. We'll light the flash ... here, you hold it, so that I can have both\r\nhands free. Put both arms around me, just under the arms, and stick to\r\nme like a porous plaster, because if I have to move at all, I'll have\r\nto jump like chain lightning. Shine the beam right over there, so it'll\r\nreflect and light up all the dials at once. There ... hold on tight!\r\nHere they come!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, a jarring shudder shook one side of their hiding-place,\r\nthen, a moment later, the phenomenon was repeated, but with much less\r\nforce, upon the other side. Stevens sighed with relief, took the light,\r\nand extinguished it.\r\n\r\n\"Missed us clean!\" he exulted. \"Now, if they don't find us, we're all\r\nset.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can they possibly find us? I seem to be always worried about the\r\nwrong things, but I should think that their finding us would be the\r\nleast of our troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't judge their vision system by ours--they've got everything,\r\napparently. However, their apparatus may not be delicate enough to spot\r\nus in a space this small when their projectors flash through it, as they\r\nprobably will. Then, too, there's a couple of other big items in our\r\nfavor--nobody else is in the entire lower half, since all this machinery\r\ndown here is either automatic or else controlled from up above, so they\r\nwon't be expecting to see anybody when they get down this far; and we\r\naren't at all conspicuous. We're both dressed in gray--your clothes in\r\nparticular are almost exactly the color of this armor-plate--so\r\naltogether we stand a good chance of being missed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing whatever--wish we could sleep for a couple of hours, but of\r\ncourse there's no hope of that. Stretch out here, like that--you can't\r\nrest folded up like an accordion--and I'll lie down diagonally across\r\nthe room. There's just room for me that way. That's one advantage of\r\nweightlessness--you can lie down standing on your head, and go to sleep\r\nand like it. But I forgot--you've never been weightless before, have\r\nyou? Does it make you sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much, now, except that I feel awfully weird inside. I was\r\nhorribly dizzy and nauseated at first, but it's going away.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"That's good--it makes lots of people pretty sick. In fact, some folks\r\nget awfully sick and can't seem to get used to it at all. It's the\r\ncanals in the inner ear that do most of it, you know. However, if you're\r\nas well as that already, you'll be a regular spacehound in half an hour.\r\nI've been weightless for weeks at a stretch, out in the _Sirius_, and\r\nnow I've got so I really like it. Here, we'd better keep in touch.\"\r\nHe found her hand and tucked it under his arm. \"Stabilize our positions\r\nmore, besides keeping us from getting too lonesome, here in the dark,\"\r\nhe concluded, in a matter-of-fact voice.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for saying 'us'--but you would, wouldn't you?\" and a wave of\r\nadmiration went through her for the real and chivalrous manhood of the\r\nman with whom she had been forced by circumstances to cast her lot.\r\n\"How long must we stay here?\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as the air lasts, and I'd like to stay here longer than that.\r\nWe don't want to move around any more than we absolutely have to until\r\ntheir rays are off of us, and we have no way of knowing how long that\r\nwill be. Also, we'd better keep still. I don't know what kind of an\r\naudio system they've got, but there's no use taking unnecessary\r\nchances.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--I'm an oyster's little sister,\" and for many minutes the\r\ntwo remained motionless and silent. Now and then Nadia twitched and\r\nstarted at some vague real or imaginary sound--now and then her fingers\r\ntightened upon his biceps--and he pressed her hand with his great arm in\r\nreassurance and understanding. Once a wall of their cell resounded under\r\nthe impact of a fierce blow and Stevens instantly threw his arm around\r\nthe girl, twisting himself between her and the threatened wall, ready\r\nfor any emergency. But nothing more happened; the door remained closed,\r\nthe cell stayed bottle-tight, and time wore slowly on. All too soon the\r\nunmistakable symptoms of breathing an unfit atmosphere made themselves\r\napparent and Stevens, after testing each of the doors, drew the girl\r\ninto a larger room, where they breathed deeply of the fresh, cool air.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know that this room was whole?\" asked Nadia. \"We might have\r\nstepped out into space, mightn't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; if this room had lost its tightness, the door wouldn't have opened.\r\nThey won't open if there's a difference of one kilogram pressure on the\r\ntwo sides. That's how I knew that the room we were in at first was cut\r\nin two--the door into that air-break wouldn't move.\"\r\n\r\n\"What comes next?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know exactly what to do--we'd better hold a little council of\r\nwar. They may have gone...\" Stevens broke off as the structure began\r\nto move, and they settled down upon what had been one of the side-walls.\r\nGreater and greater became the acceleration, until their apparent weight\r\nwas almost as much as it would have been upon the Earth, at which point\r\nit became constant. \"... but they haven't,\" he continued the interrupted\r\nsentence. \"This seems to be a capture and seizure, as well as an attack,\r\nso we'll have to take the risk of looking at them. Besides, it's getting\r\ncold in here. One or two of the adjoining cells have apparently been\r\nruptured and we're radiating our heat out into space, so we'll have to\r\nget into a life-boat or freeze. I'll go pick out the best one. Wonder\r\nif I'd better take you with me, or hide you and come back after you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that--I'm coming with you,\" Nadia declared, positively.\r\n\r\n\"Just as well, probably,\" he assented, and they set out. A thorough\r\nexploration of all the tight connecting cells revealed that not a\r\nlifeboat within their reach remained intact, but that habitable and\r\nnavigable portions of three such craft were available. Selecting the\r\nmost completely equipped of these, they took up their residence therein\r\nby entering it and closing the massive insulating door. Stevens\r\ndisconnected all the lights save one, and so shielded that one before\r\nturning it on that it merely lightened the utter darkness into a\r\nsemi-permeable gloom. He then stepped up to the lookout plate, and with\r\nhis hand upon the control, pondered long the possible consequences of\r\nwhat he wished to do.\r\n\r\n\"What harm would it do to take just a little peek?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--that's the dickens of it. Maybe none, and then again,\r\nmaybe a lot. You see, we don't know who or what we are up against. The\r\nonly thing we know is that they've got us beat a hundred ways, and we've\r\ngot to act accordingly. We've got to chance it sometime, though, if we\r\ncan ever get away, so we might as well do it now. I'll put it on very\r\nshort range first, and see what we can see. By the small number of cells\r\nwe've got here I'm afraid they've split us up lengthwise, too--so that\r\ninstead of having a whole slice of the old watermelon to live in, we've\r\ngot only about a sixth of one--shaped about like a piece of restaurant\r\npie. One thing I can do, though. I'll turn on the communicator receiver\r\nand put it on full coverage--maybe we can hear something useful.\"\r\n\r\nPutting a little power upon the visiray plate, he moved the point of\r\nprojection a short distance from their hiding-place, so that the plate\r\nshowed a view of the wreckage. The upper half of the vessel was still\r\nintact, the lower half a jumble of sharply-cut fragments. From each of\r\nthe larger pieces a brilliant ray of tangible force stretched outward.\r\nSuddenly their receiver sounded behind them, as the high-powered\r\ntransmitter in the telegraph room tried to notify headquarters of\r\ntheir plight.\r\n\r\n\"_Arcturus_ attacked and cut up being taken tow....\"\r\n\r\nRapidly as the message was uttered the transmitter died with a rattle\r\nin the middle of a word, and Nadia looked at Stevens with foreboding in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n\"They've got something, that's one thing sure, to be able to neutralize\r\nour communicator beams that way,\" he admitted. \"Not so good--we'll have\r\nto play this close to our vests, girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you just trying to cheer me up, or do you really think we have a\r\nchance?\" she demanded. \"I want to know just where we stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming clean with you, no kidding. If we can get away, we'll be all\r\nx, because I'll bet a farm that by this time Brandon's got everything\r\nthose birds have, and maybe more. They beat us to it, that's all. I'm\r\nkind of afraid, though, that getting away isn't going to be quite as\r\nsimple as shooting fish down a well.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFar ahead of them a port opened, a lifeboat shot out at its full power,\r\nand again their receiver tried to burst into sound, but it was a vain\r\nattempt. The sound died before one complete word could be uttered, and\r\nthe lifeboat, its power completely neutralized by the rays of the tiny\r\ncraft of the enemy, floated gently back toward the mass of its parent\r\nand accompanied it in its headlong flight. Several more lifeboats made\r\nthe attempt, as the courageous officers of the _Arcturus_, some of\r\nwhom had apparently succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the captors,\r\nlaunched the little shells from various ports; but as each boat issued,\r\nits power was neutralized and it found itself dragged helplessly along\r\nin the grip of one of those mysterious, brilliant rays of force. At\r\nleast one hidden officer must have been watching the fruitless efforts,\r\nfor the next lifeboat to issue made no attempt, either to talk or to\r\nflee, but from it there flamed out into space a concentrated beam of\r\ndestruction--the terrible ray of annihilation, against which no known\r\nsubstance could endure for a moment; the ray which had definitely\r\noutlawed war. But even that frightful weapon was useless--it spent\r\nits force harmlessly upon an impalpable, invisible barrier, a hundred\r\nyards from its source, and the bold lifeboat disappeared in one blinding\r\nexplosion of incandescence as the captor showed its real power in\r\nretaliation. Stevens, jaw hard-set, leaped from the screen, then brought\r\nhimself up so quickly that he skated across the smooth steel floor.\r\nShutting off the lookout plate, he led the half-fainting girl across\r\nthe room to a comfortable seat and sat down beside her--raging, but\r\nthoughtful. Nadia soon recovered.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you acting so contrary to your nature--is it because of _me_?\"\r\nshe demanded. \"A dozen times I've seen you start to do something and\r\nthen change your mind. I _will not_ be a load on you nor hinder you in\r\nanything you want to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told your father I'd look after you, and I'm going to do it,\" he\r\nreplied, indirectly. \"I would do it anyway, of course--even if you are\r\nten or twelve years older than I thought you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Dad never has realized that I'm more than eight years old. I\r\nsee--you were going out there and be slaughtered?\" He flushed, but made\r\nno reply. \"In that case I'm glad I'm here--that would have been silly.\r\nI think we'd better hold that council of war you mentioned a while ago,\r\ndon't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I need a smoke--do you indulge?\"\r\n\r\n\"No thanks. I tried it a few times at school, but never liked it.\"\r\n\r\nHe searched his pockets, bringing to light an unopened package and a\r\ntattered remnant which proved to contain one dilapidated cigarette.\r\nHe studied it thoughtfully. \"I'll smoke this wreck,\" he decided, \"while\r\nit's still smokable. We'll save the rest of them--I'm afraid it'll be\r\na long time between smokes. Well, let's confer!\"\r\n\r\n\"This will have to be a one-sided conference. I don't imagine that any\r\nof my ideas will prove particularly helpful. You talk and I'll listen.\r\n\r\n\"You can't tell what ideas may be useful--chip in any time you feel the\r\nurge. Here's the dope, as I see it. They're highly intelligent creatures\r\nand are in all probability neither Martians nor Venerians. If any of\r\nthem had any such stuff as that, some of us would have known about it\r\nand, besides, I don't believe they would have used it in just that way.\r\nMercury is not habitable, at least for organic beings; and we have never\r\nseen any sign of any other kind of inhabitants who could work with\r\nmetals and rays. They're probably from Jupiter, although possibly from\r\nfurther away. I say Jupiter, because I would think, judging from the\r\nsmall size of the ship, that it may still be in the experimental stage,\r\nso that they probably didn't come from any further away than Jupiter.\r\nThen, too, if they were very numerous, somebody would have sighted one\r\nbefore. I'd give my left leg and four fingers for one good look at the\r\ninside of that ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you take it, then? You never even looked toward it, after\r\nthat one first glimpse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say I didn't--the reason being that they may have automatic\r\ndetectors, and as I have suggested before, our system of vision is so\r\ncrude that its use could be detected with a clothesline or a basket\r\nfull of scrap iron. But to resume: Their aim is to capture, not destroy,\r\nsince they haven't killed anybody except the one crew that attacked\r\nthem. Apparently they want to study us or something. However, they don't\r\nintend that any of us shall get away, nor even send out a word of what\r\nhas happened to us. Therefore it looks as though our best bet is to hide\r\nnow, and try to sneak away on them after a while--direct methods won't\r\nwork. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"You sound lucid. Is there any possibility of getting back, though, if\r\nwe got anywhere near Jupiter? It's so far away!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a long stretch from Jupiter to any of the planets where we have\r\npower-plants, all right--particularly now, when Mars and Tellus are\r\nsubtending an angle of something more than ninety degrees at the sun,\r\nand Venus is between the two, while Jupiter is clear across the sun from\r\nall three of them. Even when Jupiter is in mean opposition to Mars, it\r\nis still some five hundred and fifty million kilometers away, so you\r\ncan form some idea as to how far it is from our nearest planet now.\r\nNo, if we expect to get back under our own power, we've got to break away\r\npretty quick--these lifeboats have very little accumulator capacity, and\r\nthe receptors are useless above about three hundred million\r\nkilometers....\"\r\n\r\n\"But it'll take us a long time to go that far, won't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very. Our own ships, using only the acceleration of gravity, and\r\nboth plus and minus at that, make the better than four hundred million\r\nkilometers of the long route to Mars in five days. These birds are using\r\nalmost that much acceleration, and I don't see how they do it. They must\r\nhave a tractor ray. Brandon claimed that such a thing was theoretically\r\npossible, but Westfall and I couldn't see it. We ragged him about it a\r\nlot--and he was right. I thought, of course, they'd drift with us, but\r\nthey are using power steadily. They've got _some_ system!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they could be using intra-atomic energy? We were taught that it\r\nwas impossible, but you've shattered a lot of my knowledge today.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't want to say definitely that it is absolutely impossible,\r\nbut the deeper we go into that line, the more unlikely intra-atomic\r\nenergy power-plants become. No, they've got a real power-transmission\r\nsystem--one that can hold a tight beam together a lot farther than\r\nanything we have been able to develop, that's all. Well, we've given\r\nthem quite a lot of time to get over any suspicion of us, let's see\r\nif we can sneak away from them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy short and infrequent applications of power to the dirigible\r\nprojectors of the life-boat, Stevens slowly shifted the position of\r\nthe fragment which bore their craft until it was well clear of the\r\nother components of the mass of wreckage. He then exerted a very small\r\nretarding force, so that their bit would lag behind the procession, as\r\nthough it had accidently been separated. But the crew of the captor was\r\nalert, and no sooner did a clear space show itself between them and the\r\nmass than a ray picked them up and herded them back into place. Stevens\r\nthen nudged other pieces so that they fell out, only to see them also\r\nrounded up. Hour after hour he kept trying--doing nothing sufficiently\r\nenergetic to create any suspicion, but attempting everything he could\r\nthink of that offered any chance of escape from the clutches of their\r\ncaptors. Immovable at the plate, his hands upon the controls, he\r\nperformed every insidious maneuver his agile brain could devise, but\r\nhe could not succeed in separating their vehicle from its fellows.\r\nFinally, after a last attempt, which was foiled as easily as were its\r\npredecessors, he shut off his controls and turned to his companion\r\nwith a grin.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think I could get away with it--they're keen, that gang--but\r\nI had to keep at it as long as it would have done us any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it do us any good now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit--we're going so fast that we couldn't stop--we're out of even\r\nradio range of our closest power-plant. We'll have to put off any more\r\nattempts until they slow us down. They're fairly close to at least one\r\nof the moons of Jupiter, we'll have our best chance--so good, in fact,\r\nthat I really think we can make it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what good would that do us, if we couldn't get back?\" Dire\r\nforeboding showed in her glorious eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of things not tried yet, girl, and we'll try them all. First, we\r\nget away. Second, we try to get in touch with Norman Brandon....\"\r\n\r\n\"How? No known radio will carry half that far.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I think that a radio as yet unknown may be able to--and there\r\nis a bare possibility that I'll be able to communicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh wonderful--that lifts a frightful load off my mind,\" she breathed.\r\n\r\n\"But just a minute--I said I'd come clean with you, and I will. The odds\r\nare all against us, no matter what we do. If that unknown radio won't\r\nwork--and it probably won't--there are several other things we can try,\r\nbut they're all pretty slim chances. Even if we get away, it'll probably\r\nbe about the same thing as though you were to be marooned on a desert\r\nisland without any tools, and with your rescue depending upon your\r\nability to build a high-powered radio station with which to call to\r\na mainland for help. However, if we don't try to get away, our only\r\nalternative is letting them know we're here, and joining our friends\r\nin captivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then what?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know as much as I do. Imprisonment and restraint, certain; death,\r\npossible; return to Earth, almost certainly impossible--life as guests,\r\nhighly improbable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm with you, Steve, all the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's time to spring off--we've both been awake better than fifty\r\nhours. Personally, I'm all in, and you're so near dead that you're a\r\nphysical wreck. We'll get us a bite of supper and turn in.\"\r\n\r\nAn appetizing supper was prepared from the abundant stores and each\r\nate a heartier meal than either would have believed possible. Stevens\r\nconsidered his unopened package of cigarettes, then regretfully put it\r\nback into his pocket still unopened and turned to Nadia.\r\n\r\n\"Well, little fellow, it's time to shove off, and then some. You might\r\nas well sleep here, and I'll go in there. If anything scares you, yell.\r\nGood-night, old trapper!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Steve.\" Nadia flushed, and her brown eyes and black\r\neyebrows, in comparison with her golden-blond hair, lent her face a\r\nquizzical, elfin expression that far belied her feelings as she stared\r\nstraight into his eyes. \"I've never even been away from the Earth\r\nbefore, and with all this happening I'm simply scared to death. I've\r\nbeen trying to hide it, but I couldn't stand it alone, and we're going\r\nto be together too long and too close for senseless conventions to\r\naffect us. There's two bunks over there--why don't you sleep in one\r\nof them?\"\r\n\r\nHe returned her steadfast gaze for a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n\"All x with me, Nadia,\" he answered, keeping out of his voice all\r\nsigns of the tenderness he felt for her, and of his very real admiration\r\nfor her straightforward conduct in a terrifying situation. \"You trust\r\nme, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Trust_ you! Don't be silly--I know you! I know you, and I know Brandon\r\nand Westfall--I know what you've done, and exactly the kind of men you\r\nare. _Trust_ you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, old golf-shootist,\" and promises were made and received\r\nin a clasp from which Nadia's right hand, strong as it was, emerged\r\nslightly damaged.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, what is your first name, fellow-traveller?\" she asked in\r\nlighter vein. \"Nobody, not even Dad or Breckie, ever seems to call you\r\nanything but 'Steve' when they talk about you.\" She was amazed at the\r\neffect of her innocent question, for Stevens flushed to his hair and\r\nspluttered.\r\n\r\n\"It's _Percy_!\" He finally, snorted. \"Percival Van Schravendyck Stevens.\r\nWouldn't that tear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I think Percival's a real nice name!\"\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" he hissed in burlesque style. \"Young woman, I have revealed\r\nto you a secret known to but few living creatures. On your life, keep\r\nit inviolate!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well, if you insist. Good-night--Steve!\" and she gave him a\r\nradiant and honest smile: the first smile he had seen since the moment\r\nof the attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCastaways Upon Ganymede\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon awakening, the man's first care was to instruct the girl in the\r\noperation of the projectors, so that she could keep the heavily-armored\r\nedge of their small section, which she had promptly christened \"The\r\nForlorn Hope,\" between them and the grinding, clashing mass of wreckage,\r\nand thus, if it should become necessary, protect the relatively frail\r\ninner portions of their craft from damage.\r\n\r\n\"Keep an eye on things for a while, Nadia,\" he instructed, as soon as\r\nshe could handle the controls, \"and don't use any more power than is\r\nabsolutely necessary. We'll need it all, and besides, they can probably\r\ndetect anything we can use. There's probably enough leakage from the\r\nruptured accumulator cells to mask quite a little emission, but don't\r\nuse much. I'm going to see what I can do about making this whole wedge\r\nnavigable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not just launch what's left of this lifeboat? It's space-worthy,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it's too small. Two or three of the big dirigible projectors\r\nof the lower band are on the rim of this piece-of-pie-shaped section\r\nwe're riding, I think. If so, and if enough batteries of accumulators\r\nare left intact to give them anywhere nearly full power, we can get an\r\nacceleration that will make a lifeboat look sick. Those main dirigibles,\r\nyou know, are able to swing the whole mass of the _Arcturus_, and what\r\nthey'll do to this one chunk of it--we've got only a few thousand tons\r\nof mass in this piece--will be something pretty. Also, having the metal\r\nmay save us months of time in mining it.\"\r\n\r\nHe found the projectors, repaired or cut out the damaged accumulator\r\ncells, and reconnected them through the controls of the lifeboat.\r\nHe moved into the \"engine-room\" the airtanks, stores, and equipment\r\nfrom all the other fragments which, by means of a space-suit, he could\r\nreach without too much difficulty. From the battery rooms of those\r\nfragments--open shelves, after being sliced open by the shearing ray--he\r\nhelped himself to banks of accumulator cells from the enormous driving\r\nbatteries of the ill-fated _Arcturus_, bolting them down and connecting\r\nthem solidly until almost every compartment of their craft was one mass\r\nof stored-up energy.\r\n\r\nDays fled like hours, so furiously busy were they in preparing their\r\npeculiar vessel for a cruise of indefinite duration. Stevens cut himself\r\nshort on sleep and snatched his meals in passing; and Nadia, when not\r\nbusy at her own tasks of observing, housekeeping, and doing what little\r\npiloting was required, was rapidly learning to wield most effectively\r\nthe spanner and pliers of the mechanic and electrician.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid our time is getting short, Steve,\" she announced, after\r\nmaking an observation. \"It looks as though we're getting wherever it\r\nis we're going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've got only two more jobs to do, but they're the hardest of the\r\nlot. It is Jupiter, or can you tell yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jupiter or one of its satellites, I think, from the point where they\r\nreversed their power. Here's the observation you told me to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like Jupiter,\" he agreed, after he had rapidly checked her\r\nfigures. \"We'll pass very close to one of those two satellites--probably\r\nGanymede--which is fine for our scheme. All four of the major satellites\r\nhave water and atmosphere, but Ganymede, being largest, is best for our\r\npurposes. We've got a couple of days yet--just about time to finish up.\r\nLet's get going--you know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Steve, I'm afraid of it. It's too dangerous--isn't there some other\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\n\"None that I can see. The close watch they're keeping on every bit of\r\nthis junk makes it our only chance for a get-away. I'm pretty sure I\r\ncan do it--but if I should happen to get nipped, just use enough power\r\nto let them know you're here, and you won't be any worse off than if\r\nI hadn't tried to pull off this stunt.\"\r\n\r\nHe donned a space-suit, filled a looped belt with tools, picked up a\r\nportable power-drill, and stepped into the tiny air-lock. Nadia deftly\r\nguided their segment against one of the larger fragments and held it\r\nthere with a gentle, steady pressure, while Stevens, a light cable\r\npaying out behind him, clambered carefully over the wreckage, brought\r\nhis drill into play, and disappeared inside the huge wedge. In less than\r\nan hour he returned without mishap and reported to the glowing girl.\r\n\r\n\"Just like shooting fish down a well! Most of the accumulator cells were\r\ntight, and installing the relays wasn't a bad job at all. Believe me,\r\ngirl, there'll be junk filling all the space between here and Saturn\r\nwhen we touch them off!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful, Steve!\" Nadia exclaimed. \"It won't be so bad seeing you go\r\ninto the others, now that you have this one all rigged up.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAround and around the mass of wreckage they crept, and in each of the\r\nlarger sections Stevens connected up the enormous fixed or dirigible\r\nprojectors to whatever accumulator cells were available through\r\nsensitive relays, all of which he could close by means of one radio\r\nimpulse. The long and dangerous task done, he stood at the lookout\r\nplate, studying the huge disk which had been the upper portion of the\r\nlower half of the _Arcturus_ and frowning in thought. Nadia reached over\r\nhis shoulder and switched off the plate.\r\n\r\n\"Nix on that second job, big fellow!\" she declared. \"They aren't really\r\nnecessary, and you're altogether too apt to be killed trying to get\r\nthem. It's too ghastly--I won't stand for your trying it, so that\r\nends it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have them, really,\" he protested. \"With those special\r\ntools, cutting torches, and all the stuff, we'd be sitting pretty.\r\nWe'll lose weeks of time by not having them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll just have to lose it, then. You can't get 'em, any more than\r\na baby can get the moon, so stop crying about it,\" she went over the\r\nfamiliar argument for the twentieth time. \"That stuff up there is all\r\ngrinding together like cakes of ice in a floe; the particular section\r\nyou want is in plain sight of whoever is on watch; and those tools and\r\nthings are altogether too heavy to handle. You're a husky brute, I know,\r\nbut even you couldn't begin to handle them, even if you had good going.\r\nI couldn't help you very much, even if you'd let me try; and the fact\r\nthat you so positively refuse to let me come along shows how dangerous\r\nyou know the attempt is bound to be. You'd probably never even get up\r\nthere alive, to say nothing of getting back here. No, Steve, that's out\r\nlike a light.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sure wish they'd left us weightless for a while, sometime, if only\r\nfor an hour or two,\" he mourned.\r\n\r\n\"But they didn't!\" she retorted, practically. \"So we're just out of luck\r\nto that extent. Our time is about up, too. It's time you worked us back\r\nto the tail end of this procession--or rather, the head end, since we're\r\ntraveling 'down' now.\"\r\n\r\nStevens took the controls and slowly worked along the outer edge of the\r\nmass, down toward its extremity. Nadia put one hand upon his shoulder\r\nand he glanced around.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Steve. We have a perfectly wonderful chance as it is, and we've\r\ngone so far with our scheme together that it would be a crying shame not\r\nto be able to go through with it. I'd hate like sin to have to surrender\r\nto them now, and that's all I could do if anything should become of you.\r\nBesides...\" her voice died away into silence.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, you're right,\" he hastily replied, dodging the implication of\r\nthat unfinished sentence. \"I couldn't figure out anything that looked\r\nparticularly feasible anyway--that's why I didn't try it. We'll pass\r\nit up.\"\r\n\r\nSoon they arrived at their objective and maintained a position well in\r\nthe van, but not sufficiently far ahead of the rest to call forth a\r\nrestraining ray from their captors. Already strongly affected by the\r\ngravitational pull of the mass of the satellite, many of the smaller\r\nportions of the wreck, not directly held by the tractors, began to\r\nseparate from the main mass. As each bit left its place another beam\r\nleaped out, until it became apparent that no more were available, and\r\nStevens strapped the girl and himself down before two lookout plates.\r\n\r\n\"Now for it, Nadia!\" he exclaimed, and simultaneously threw on the power\r\nof his own projectors and sent out the radio impulse which closed the\r\nrelays he had so carefully set. They were thrown against the restraining\r\nstraps savagely and held there by an enormous weight as the gigantic\r\ndirigible projectors shot their fragment of the wreck away from the\r\ncomparatively slight force which had been acting upon it, but they\r\nbraced themselves and strained their muscles in order to watch what\r\nwas happening. As the relays in the various fragments closed, the\r\nmassed power of the accumulators was shorted dead across the converters\r\nand projectors instead of being fed into them gradually through the\r\ncontrols of the pilot, with a result comparable to that of the explosion\r\nof an ammunition dump. Most of the masses, whose projectors were fed\r\nby comparatively few accumulator cells, darted away entirely with a\r\nstupendous acceleration. A few of them, however, received the unimpeded\r\nflow of complete batteries. Those projectors tore loose from even\r\ntheir massive supports and crashed through anything opposing them like\r\na huge, armor-piercing projectile. It was a spectacle to stagger the\r\nimagination, and Stevens grinned as he turned to the girl, who was\r\nstaring in wide-eyed amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ace, I think they're busy enough now so that it'll be safe\r\nto take that long-wanted look at their controls,\" and he flashed\r\nthe twin beams of his lookout light out beyond the upper half of the\r\n_Arcturus_--only to see them stop abruptly in mid-space. Even the\r\nextremely short carrier-wave of Roeser's Rays could not go through the\r\ninvisible barrier thrown out by the tiny, but powerful globe of space.\r\n\r\n\"No penetration?\" Nadia asked.\r\n\r\n\"Flattened them out cold. 'However,' as the fox once remarked about the\r\ngrapes, 'I'll bet they're sour, anyway.' We'll have some stuff of our\r\nown, one of these days. I sure hope the fireworks we started back there\r\nkeep those birds amused until we get out of sight, because if I use much\r\nmore power on these projectors we may not have juice enough left to stop\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're using enough now to suit me--I'm so heavy I can hardly lift\r\na finger!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better lift 'em! You must watch what's going on back there while\r\nI navigate around this moon.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x, chief.... They've got their hands full, apparently. Those rays\r\nare shooting around all over the sky. It looks as though they were\r\ntrying to capture four or five things at once with each one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! Tell me when the moon cuts them off.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the awful acceleration they were using, which constantly increased\r\nthe terrific velocity with which they had been traveling when they made\r\ngood their escape, it was not long until they had placed the satellite\r\nbetween them and the enemy; then Stevens cut down and reversed his\r\npower. Such was their speed, however, that a long detour was necessary\r\nin order to reduce it to a safe landing rate. As soon as this could be\r\ndone, Stevens headed for the morning zone and dropped the \"Hope\" rapidly\r\ntoward the surface of that new, strange world. Details could not be\r\ndistinguished at first because of an all-enshrouding layer of cloud, but\r\nthe rising sun dispelled the mist, and when they had descended to within\r\na few thousand feet of the surface, their vision was unobstructed.\r\nImmediately below them the terrain was mountainous and heavily wooded;\r\nwhile far to the east the rays of a small, pale sun glinted upon a vast\r\nbody of water. No signs of habitation were visible as far as the eye\r\ncould reach.\r\n\r\n\"Now to pick out a location for our power-plant. We must have a\r\nwaterfall for power, a good place to hide our ship from observation, and\r\nI'd like to have a little seam of coal. We can use wood if we have to,\r\nbut I think we can find some coal. This is all sedimentary rock--it\r\nlooks a lot like the country along the North Fork of the Flathead, in\r\nMontana. There are a lot of coal outcrops, usually, in such topography\r\nas this is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want to hide in a hurry, though, don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not particularly, I think. If they had missed us at all, they would\r\nhave had us long ago, and with all the damage we did with those\r\nprojectors they won't be surprised at one piece being missing--I imagine\r\nthey lost a good many.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they'll know that somebody caused all that disturbance. Won't they\r\nhunt for us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe, and maybe not--no telling what they'll do. However, by the time\r\nthey can land and get checked up and ready to hunt for us, we'll be a\r\nmighty small needle, well hidden in a good big haystack.\"\r\n\r\nFor several hours they roamed over the mountainous region at high\r\nvelocity, seeking the best possible location, and finally they found\r\none that was almost ideal--a narrow canyon overhung with heavy trees,\r\nopening into a wide, deep gorge upon a level with its floor. A mighty\r\nwaterfall cascaded into the gorge just above the canyon, and here\r\nand there could be seen black outcrops which Stevens, after a close\r\nscrutiny, declared to be coal. He deftly guided their cumbersome wedge\r\nof steel into the retreat, allowed it to settle gently to the ground,\r\nand shut off the power.\r\n\r\n\"Well, little fellow-conspirator against the peace and dignity of the\r\nJovians, I don't know just where we are, but wherever it is, we're here.\r\nWe got away clean, and as long as we don't use any high-tension stuff or\r\nanything else that they can trace, I think we're as safe as money in a\r\nbank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that I ought to be scared to death, Steve, but I'm not--I'm\r\njust too thrilled for words,\" Nadia answered, and the eager sparkle in\r\nher eyes bore out her words. \"Can we go out now? How about air? Shall we\r\nwear suits or go out as we are? Have you got a weapon of any kind? Hurry\r\nup--let's do something!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pipe down, ace! Remember that we don't know any more about anything\r\naround here than a pig does about Sunday, and conduct yourself\r\naccordingly. Take it easy. I'm surprised at the gravity here. This is\r\ncertainly Ganymede, and it has a diameter of only about fifty seven\r\nhundred kilometers. If I remember correctly, Damoiseau estimated its\r\nmass at about three one-hundredths that of the Earth, which would make\r\nits surface gravity about one-sixth. However, it is actually almost a\r\nhalf, as you see by this spring-balance here. Therefore it is quite a\r\nlittle more massive than has been....\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it? Let's go places and do things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm yourself, Ginger, you've got lots of time--we'll be here for quite\r\na while, I'm afraid. We can't go out until we analyze the air--we're\r\nsure lucky there's as much as there is. I'm not exactly the world's\r\nforemost chemist, but fortunately an air-analysis isn't much of a job\r\nwith the apparatus we carry.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Nadia controlled her impatience as best she could, Stevens\r\nmanipulated the bulbs and pipettes of the gas apparatus.\r\n\r\n\"Pressure, fifty-two centimeters--more than I dared hope for--and\r\nanalysis all x, I believe. Oxygen concentration a little high, but\r\nnot much.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't have to wear the space-suits, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless I missed something in the analysis. The pressure corresponds\r\nto our own at a height of about three thousand meters, which we can get\r\nused to without too much trouble. Good thing, too. I brought along all\r\nthe air I could get hold of, but as I told you back there, if we had to\r\ndepend on it altogether, we might be out of luck. I'm going to pump some\r\nof our air back into a cylinder to equalize our pressure--don't want\r\nto waste any of it until we're sure the outside air suits us without\r\ntreatment.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the pressure inside had been gradually reduced to that outside and\r\nthey had become accustomed to breathing the rarefied medium, Stevens\r\nopened the airlock and the outside doors, and for some time cautiously\r\nsniffed the atmosphere of the satellite. He could detect nothing harmful\r\nor unusual in it--it was apparently the same as earthly air--and he\r\nbecame jubilant.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Nadia--luck is perched right on our banner. Freedom, air, water,\r\npower, and coal! Now as you suggested, we'll go places and do things!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose it's safe?\" Her first eagerness to explore their surroundings\r\nhad abated noticeably. \"You aren't armed, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and I don't believe that there was a gun of any kind aboard the\r\n_Arcturus_. That kind of thing went out quite a while ago, you know.\r\nWe'll take a look, anyway--we've got to find out about that coal before\r\nwe decide to settle down here. Remember this half-gravity stuff, and\r\ncontrol your leg-muscles accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nLeaping lightly to the ground, they saw that the severed section of\r\nfifty-inch armor, which was the rim of their conveyance, almost blocked\r\nthe entrance to the narrow canyon which they had selected for their\r\nretreat. Upon one side that wall of steel actually touched the almost\r\nperpendicular wall or rock; upon the other side there was left only a\r\nnarrow passage. They stepped through it, so that they could see the\r\nwaterfall and the gorge, and stopped silent. The sun, now fairly high,\r\nwas in no sense the familiar orb of day, but was a pale, insipid thing,\r\nonly one-fifth the diameter of the sun to which they were accustomed,\r\nand which could almost be studied with the unshielded eye. From their\r\nfeet a grassy meadow a few hundred feet wide sloped gently down to the\r\nriver, from whose farther bank a precipice sprang upward for perhaps\r\na thousand feet--merging into towering hills whose rugged grandeur was\r\nreminiscent of the topography of the moon. At their backs the wall of\r\nthe gorge was steep, but not precipitous, and was covered with shrubs\r\nand trees--some of which leaned out over the little canyon, completely\r\nscreening it, and among whose branches birds could now and then be seen\r\nflitting about. In that direction no mountains were visible, indicating\r\nthat upon their side of the river there was an upland plateau or bench.\r\nTo their right the river, the gorge, and the strip of meadow extended\r\nfor a mile or more, then curved away and were lost to sight. To their\r\nleft, almost too close for comfort, was the stupendous cataract,\r\ntowering above them to a terror-inspiring height. Nadia studied it\r\nwith awe, which changed to puzzled wonder.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with it, Steve? It looks like a picture in slow\r\nmotion, like the kind they take of your dives--or am I seeing things?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's really slow, compared to what we're used to. Remember that\r\none-half gravity stuff!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's right, but it certainly does look funny. It gives me the\r\ncreeps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get used to it pretty quick--just as you'll get used to all the\r\nrest of the things having only half their earthly weight and falling\r\nonly half as fast as they ought to when you drop them. Well, I don't see\r\nanything that looks dangerous yet--let's go up toward the falls a few\r\nmeters and prospect that outcrop.\"\r\n\r\nWith a few brisk strokes of an improvised shovel he cleared the outcrop\r\nof detritus and broke off several samples of the black substance, with\r\nwhich they went back to the \"Forlorn Hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's real coal,\" Stevens announced after a series of tests. \"I've seen\r\nbetter, but on the other hand, there's lots worse. It'll make good gas,\r\nand a kind of a coke. Not so hot, but it'll do. Now we'd better get\r\norganized old partner, for a long campaign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead and organize--I'm only the cheap help in this enterprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheap help! You're apt to be the life of the party. Can you make and\r\nshoot a bow and arrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say I can--I've belonged to an archery club for five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did I tell you? You're a life saver! Here's the dope--we've got\r\nto save our own supplies as much as possible until we know exactly what\r\nwe're up against, and to do that, we've got to live off the country.\r\nI'll fake up something to knock over some of those birds and small game,\r\nthen we can make real bow-strings and feathered arrows and I'll forge\r\nsome steel arrow-heads while you're making yourself a real bow. We'd\r\nbetter make me about a hundred-pound war bow, too....\"\r\n\r\n\"A _hundred_!\" interrupted Nadia. \"That's a lot of bow, big boy--think\r\nyou can bend it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd be surprised,\" he grinned. \"I'm not quite like Robin Hood--I've\r\nbeen known to miss a finger-thick wand at a hundred paces--but I'm not\r\nexactly a beginner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course--I should have known by your language that you're an\r\narcher, otherwise you'd never have used such an old-fashioned word as\r\n'pounds.' I shoot a thirty-five-pound bow ordinarily, but for game I\r\nshould have the heaviest one I can hold accurately--about a forty-five,\r\nprobably.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x. And as soon as I can I'll make us a couple of suits of fairly\r\nheavy steel armor, so that we'll have real protection if we should need\r\nit. You see, we don't know what we are apt to run up against out here.\r\nThen, with that much done, it'll be up to you to provide, since I'll\r\nhave to work tooth and nail at the forges. You'll have to bring home the\r\nbacon, do the cooking and so on, and see what you can find along the\r\nline of edible roots, grains, fruits, and what-not. Sort of reverse the\r\nIndian idea--you be the hunter and I'll keep the home fires burning.\r\nCan do?\"\r\n\r\n\"What it takes to do that, I've got,\" Nadia assured him, her eyes\r\nsparkling. \"Have you your job planned out as well and as fittingly as\r\nyou have mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then some. We've got just two methods of getting away from\r\nhere--one is to get in touch with Brandon, so that he'll come after us;\r\nthe other is to recharge our accumulators and try to make it under our\r\nown power. Either course will need power and lots of it....\"\r\n\r\n\"I never thought of going back in the 'Hope.' Suppose we could?\"\r\n\r\n\"About as doubtful as the radio--I think that I could build a pair of\r\nmatched-frequency auto-dirigible transmitter and receptor units, such as\r\nare necessary for space-ships fed by stationary power-plants, but after\r\nI got them built, they'd take us less than half way there. Then we'd\r\nhave only what power we can carry, and I hate even to think of what\r\nprobably would happen to us. We'd certainly have to drift for months\r\nbefore we could get close enough to any of our plants to radio for help,\r\nand we'd be taking awful chances. You see, we'd have to take a very\r\npeculiar orbit, and if we should miss connections passing the inner\r\nplanets, what the sun would do to us at the closest point and where\r\nwhat's left of us would go on the back-swing, would be just too bad!\r\nBesides, if we can get hold of the _Sirius_, they'll come loaded for\r\nbear, and we may be able to do something about the rest of the folks\r\nout here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" breathed the girl. \"Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could!\r\nI thought, of course, they'd all be....\" her voice died away.\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily--there's always a chance. That's why I'm trying the\r\nultra-radio first. However, either course will take lots of power,\r\nso the first thing I've got to do is to build a power plant. I'm\r\ngoing to run a penstock up those falls, and put in a turbine, driving\r\na high-tension alternator. Then, while I'm trying to build the\r\nultra-radio, I'll be charging our accumulators, so that no time will\r\nbe lost in case the radio fails. If it does fail--and remember I'm not\r\ncounting on its working--of course I'll tackle the transmission and\r\nreceptor units before we start out to drift it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say it easy, Steve, but how can you build all those things, with\r\nnothing to work with?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's going to be a real job--I'm not try to kid you into thinking it'll\r\nbe either easy or quick. Here's the way everything will go. Before I can\r\neven lay the first length of the penstock, I've got to have the pipe--to\r\nmake which I've got to have flat steel--to get which I'll have to cut\r\nsome of the partitions out of this ship of ours--to do which I'll have\r\nto have a cutting torch--to make which I'll have to forge nozzles out of\r\nblock metal and to run which I'll have to have gas--to get which I'll\r\nhave to mine coal and build a gas-plant--to do which....\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, Steve, are you going back to the Stone Age? I never\r\nthought of half those things. Why, it's impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite, guy. Things could be a lot worse--that's why I brought along\r\nthe whole 'Forlorn Hope,' instead of just the lifeboat. As it is, we've\r\ngot several thousand tons of spare steel and lots of copper. We've got\r\nordinary tools and a few light motors, blowers, and such stuff. That\r\ngives me a great big start--I won't have to mine the ores and smelt the\r\nmetals, as would have been necessary otherwise. However, it'll be plenty\r\nbad. I'll have to start out in a pretty crude fashion, and for some of\r\nthe stuff I'll need I'll have to make, not only the machine that makes\r\nthe part I want, but also the machine that makes the machine that\r\nmakes the machine that makes it--and so on, just how far down the line,\r\nI haven't dared to think.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be a regular jack-of-all-trades, to think you can get away\r\nwith such a program as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am--nothing else but. You see, while most of my school training\r\nwas in advanced physics and mathematics, I worked my way through by\r\ncomputing and designing, and I've done a lot of truck-horse labor of\r\nvarious kinds besides. I can calculate and design almost anything, and\r\nI can make a pretty good stab at translating a design into fabricated\r\nmaterial. I wouldn't wonder if Brandon's ultra-radio would stop me,\r\nsince nobody had even started to build one when I saw him last--but I\r\nhelped compute it, know the forces involved as well as he did at that\r\ntime, and it so happens that I know more about the design of coils and\r\nfields of force than I do about anything else. So I may be able to work\r\nit out eventually. It isn't going to be not knowing how that will hold\r\nme up--it'll be the lack of something that I can't build.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's where you will go back and back and back, as you said about\r\nbuilding the penstock?\"\r\n\r\n\"Back and back is right, if I can find all the necessary raw\r\nmaterials--that's what's probably going to put a lot of monkey-wrenches\r\ninto the machinery.\" And Stevens went to work upon a weapon of offense,\r\nfashioning a crude, but powerful bow from a strip of spring steel strung\r\nwith heavy wire.\r\n\r\n\"How about arrows? Shall I go see if I can hit a bird with a rock, for\r\nfeathers, and see if I can find something to make arrows out of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet--anyway, I'd bet on the birds! I'm going to use pieces of this\r\nlight brace-rod off the accumulator cells for arrows. They won't fly\r\ntrue, of course, but with their mass I can give them enough projectile\r\nforce to kill any small animal they hit, no matter how they hit it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter many misses, he finally bagged a small animal, something like\r\na rabbit and something like a kangaroo, and a couple of round-bodied,\r\nplump birds, almost as large as domestic hens. These they dressed,\r\nwith considerable distaste and a noticeable lack of skill.\r\n\r\n\"We'll get used to it pretty quick, Diana--also more expert,\" he said\r\nwhen the task was done. \"We now have raw material for bow-strings and\r\nclothes, as well as food.\"\r\n\r\n\"The word 'raw' being heavily accented,\" Nadia declared, with a grimace.\r\n\"But how do we know that they're good to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to eat 'em and see,\" he grinned. \"I don't imagine that any\r\nflesh is really poisonous, and we'll have to arrive at the ones we like\r\nbest by a process of trial and error. Well, here's your job--I'll get\r\nbusy on mine. Don't go more than a few hundred meters away and yell if\r\nyou get into a jam.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a couple of questions I want to ask you. What makes it so\r\nwarm here, when the sun's so far away and Jupiter isn't supposed to be\r\nradiating any heat? And how about time? It's twelve hours by my watch\r\nsince sunrise this morning, and it's still shining.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for heat, I've been wondering about that. It must be due to internal\r\nheat, because even though Jupiter may be warm, or even hot, it certainly\r\nisn't radiating much, since it has a temperature of minus two hundred at\r\nthe visible surface, which, of course, is the top of the atmosphere. Our\r\nheat here is probably caused by radioactivity--that's the most modern\r\ndope, I believe. As for time, it looks as though our days were something\r\nbetter than thirty hours long, instead of twenty-four. Of course I'll\r\nkeep the chronometer going on I-P time, since we'll probably need it in\r\nworking out observations; but we might as well let our watches run down\r\nand work, eat, and sleep by the sun--not much sense in trying to keep\r\nTellurian time here, as I see it. Check?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x. I'll have supper ready for you at sunset. 'Bye!\"\r\n\r\nA few evenings later, when Stevens came in after his long day's work,\r\nhe was surprised to see Nadia dressed in a suit of brown coveralls and\r\nhigh-laced moccasins.\r\n\r\n\"How do I look?\" she asked, pirouetting gayly.\r\n\r\n\"Neat, but not gaudy,\" he approved. \"That's good mole-skin--smooth,\r\nsoft, and tough. Where'd you make the raise? I didn't know we had\r\nanything like that on board. What did you do for thread? You look like\r\na million dollars--you sure did a good job of fitting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had to have something--what with all the thorns and brush, there was\r\nalmost more of me exposed than covered, and I was getting scratched up\r\nsomething fierce. So I ripped up one of the space-suits, and found out\r\nthat there's enough cloth, fur, and leather in one of them to make six\r\nordinary suits, and thread by the kilometer. I was awfully glad to see\r\nall that thread--I had an idea that I'd have to unravel my stockings or\r\nsomething, but I didn't. Your clothes are getting pretty tacky, too, and\r\nyou're getting all burned with those hot coals and things. I'm going to\r\nbuild you a suit out of leather for your blacksmithing activities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine business, ace! Then we can save what's left of our civilized\r\nclothes for the return trip. What do we eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"The eternal question of the hungry laboring man! I've got a roasted\r\nbongo, a fried filamaloo bird, and a boiled warple for the meat dishes.\r\nFor vegetables, mashed hikoderms and pimola greens. Neocorn bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Translate that, please, into terms of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Translate it yourself, after you eat it. I changed the system on you\r\ntoday. I've named all the things, so it'll be easier to keep track of\r\nthose we like and the ones we don't.\"\r\n\r\nWith appetites sharp-set by long hours of hard labor they ate heartily;\r\nthen, in the deepening twilight, they sat and talked in comradely\r\nfashion while Stevens smoked one precious cigarette.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not long until Nadia had her work well in hand. Game was\r\nplentiful, and the fertile valley and the neighboring upland yielded\r\npeculiar, but savory vegetable foods in variety and abundance; so that\r\nsoon she was able to spend some time with Stevens, helping him as much\r\nas she could. Thus she came to realize the true magnitude of the task he\r\nfaced and the real seriousness of their position.\r\n\r\nAs Stevens had admitted before the work was started, he had known that\r\nhe had set himself a gigantic task, but he had not permitted himself to\r\nfollow, step by step, the difficulties that he knew awaited him. Now,\r\nas the days stretched into weeks and on into months, he was forced to\r\ntake every laborious step, and it was borne in upon him just how nearly\r\nimpossible that Herculean labor was to prove--just how dependent any\r\ngiven earthly activity is upon a vast number of others. Here he was\r\nalone--everything he needed must be manufactured by his own hands, from\r\nits original sources. He had known that progress would be slow and he\r\nhad been prepared for that; but he had not pictured, even to himself,\r\nhalf of the maddening setbacks which occurred time after time because\r\nof the crudity of the tools and equipment he was forced to use. All too\r\noften a machine or part, the product of many hours of grueling labor,\r\nwould fail because of the lack of some insignificant thing--some item\r\nso common as to be taken for granted in all terrestrial shops, but\r\nimpossible of fabrication with the means at his disposal. At such times\r\nhe would set his grim jaw a trifle harder, go back one step farther\r\ntoward the Stone Age, and begin all over again--to find the necessary\r\nraw material or a possible substitute, and then to build the apparatus\r\nand machinery necessary to produce the part he required. Thus the\r\nheart-breaking task progressed, and Nadia watched her co-laborer become\r\nleaner and harder and more desperate day by day, unable in any way to\r\nlighten his fearful load.\r\n\r\nIn the brief period of rest following a noonday meal, Stevens lay prone\r\nupon the warm, fragrant grass beside the \"Forlorn Hope,\" but it was\r\nevident to Nadia that he was not resting. His burned and blistered hands\r\nwere locked savagely behind his head, his eyes were closed too tightly,\r\nand every tense line of his body was eloquent of a strain even more\r\nmental than physical. She studied him for minutes, her fine eyes\r\nclouded, then sat down beside him and put her hand upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"I want to talk to you a minute, Steve,\" she said gently.\r\n\r\n\"All x, little fellow--but it might be just as well if you didn't touch\r\nme. You see, I'm getting so rabid that I can't trust myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what I want to talk to you about.\" A fiery blush burned\r\nthrough her deep tan, but her low, clear voice did not falter and her\r\neyes held his unflinchingly. \"I know you better than you know yourself,\r\nas I've said before. You are killing yourself, but it isn't the work,\r\nfrightfully hard and disheartening as it is, that is doing it--it's\r\nyour anxiety for me and the uncertainty of everything. You haven't been\r\nable to rest because you have been raging and fuming so at unavoidable\r\nconditions--you have been fighting _facts_. And it's all _so_ useless,\r\nSteve, between you and me--everything would check out on zero if we'd\r\njust come out into the open.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's gaunt frame seemed to stiffen even more rigidly.\r\n\r\n\"You've said altogether too much or else only half enough, Nadia. You\r\nknow, of course, that I've loved you ever since I got really to know\r\nyou--and that didn't take long. You know that I love you and you know\r\nhow I love you--with the real love that a man can feel for only one\r\nwoman and only once in his life; and you know exactly what we're up\r\nagainst. Now that _does_ tear it--wide open!\" he finished bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"No, it doesn't, at all,\" she replied, steadily. \"Of course I know that\r\nyou love me, and I glory in it; and since you don't seem to realize\r\nthat I love you in exactly the same way, I'll tell you so. Love you!\r\nGood heavens, Steve, I never dreamed that such a man as you are really\r\nexisted! But you're fighting too many things at once, and they're\r\nkilling you. And they're mostly imaginary, at that. Can't you see that\r\nthere's no need of uncertainty between you and me? That there is no need\r\nof you driving yourself to desperation on my account? Whatever must be\r\nis all x with me, Steve. If you can build everything you need, all well\r\nand good. We'll be engaged until then, and our love will be open and\r\nsweet. If worst comes to worst, so that we can neither communicate with\r\nBrandon and Westfall nor leave here under our own power--even that is\r\nnothing to kill ourselves about. And yes, I do know exactly what we\r\nare facing. I have been prepared for it ever since I first saw what a\r\nperfectly impossible thing you are attempting. You are trying to go from\r\nalmost the Age of Bronze clear up to year-after-next in a month or two.\r\nNot one man in a million could have done as much in his lifetime as you\r\nhave done in the last few weeks, and I do not see how even you, with\r\nwhat little you have to work with, can possibly build such things as\r\npower-plants, transmitters, and ultra-radio stations. But what of\r\nit? For the day that it becomes clear that we are to remain here\r\nindefinitely; that day we will marry each other here, before God.\r\nLook around at this beautiful country. Could there be a finer world\r\nupon which to found a new race? When we decided to cut loose from the\r\n_Arcturus_ I told you that I was with you all the way, and now I'll\r\nrepeat it, with a lot more meaning. No matter what it's like, Steve, no\r\nmatter where it leads to, I'm with you--_to--the--end--of--the--road_.\r\nHere or upon Earth or anywhere in the Universe. I am yours for life and\r\nfor eternity.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking, the grim, strained lines upon Stevens' face\r\nhad disappeared, and as she fell silent he straightened up and gently,\r\ntenderly, reverently he took her lithe body into his arms.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, sweetheart--everything _will_ check out on zero, to\r\nnineteen decimals.\" He was a man transfigured. \"I've been fighting\r\nwindmills and I've been scared sick--but how was I to think that a\r\nwonder-girl like you could ever love a mutt like me? You certainly are\r\nthe gamest little partner a man ever had. You're the world's straightest\r\nshooter, ace--you're a square brick if there ever was one. Your sheer\r\nnerve in being willing to go the whole route makes me love you more than\r\never, if such a thing can be possible, and it certainly puts a new face\r\non the whole cock-eyed Universe for me. However, I don't believe it\r\nwill come to that. After what you've just said, I sure will lick that\r\njob, regardless of how many different factories it takes to make one\r\narmature--I'll show that mess of scrap-iron what kind of trees make\r\nshingles!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl still in his arms, he rose to his feet and released her slowly,\r\nreluctantly, unwilling ever to let her go. Then he shook himself, as\r\nthough an overwhelming burden had been lifted from his shoulders, and\r\nlaughed happily.\r\n\r\n\"See this cigarette?\" he went on lightly. \"The Last of the Mohicans.\r\nI'm going to smoke it in honor of our engagement.\" He drew the fragrant\r\nsmoke deep into his lungs and frowned at her in mock seriousness.\r\n\r\n\"This would be a nice world to live on, of course, but the jobs here\r\nare too darn steady. It also seems to be somewhat lacking in modern\r\nconveniences, such as steel-mills and machine tools. Then, too, it is\r\njust a trifle too far from the Royal and Ancient for you really to enjoy\r\nliving here permanently, and besides, I can't get my favorite brand\r\nof cigarettes around here. Therefore, after due deliberation, I don't\r\nbelieve we'll take the place--we'll go back to Tellus. Kiss me just once\r\nmore ace, and I'll make that job think a cyclone has struck it right on\r\nthe center of impact. Like Samuel Weller, or whoever it was, I'm clear\r\nfull of 'wigor, wim, and witality'!\"\r\n\r\nThe specified kiss and several others duly delivered he strode blithely\r\naway, and the little canyon resounded with the blows of his heavy sledge\r\nas he attacked with renewed spirit the great forging, white-hot from his\r\nsoak-pit, which was to become the shaft of his turbo-alternator. Nadia\r\nwatched him for a moment, her very heart in her eyes, then picked up her\r\nspanner and went after more steel, breathing a long and tremulous, but\r\nsupremely happy sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGanymedean Life\r\n\r\n\r\nSlow, hard, and disheartening as the work had been at first, Stevens\r\nhad never slackened his pace, and after a time, as his facilities\r\nincreased, the exasperating setbacks decreased in number and severity\r\nand his progress became faster and faster. Large as the \"Forlorn Hope\"\r\nwas, space was soon at a premium, for their peculiarly-shaped craft\r\nbecame a veritable factory, housing a variety of machinery and\r\nequipment unknown in any single earthly industrial plant. Nothing\r\nwas ornamental--everything was stripped to its barest fundamental\r\nnecessities--but every working part functioned with a smooth precision\r\nto delight the senses of any good mechanic.\r\n\r\nIn a cavern under the falls was the great turbine, to be full-fed by the\r\ncrude but tight penstock which clung to the wall of the gorge, angling\r\nup to the brink of that stupendous cataract. Bedded down upon solid\r\nrock there was a high-tension alternator capable of absorbing the entire\r\noutput of the mighty turbine. This turbo-alternator was connected to\r\na set of converters from which the energy would flow along three great\r\ncopper cables--the receptors of the lifeboats being altogether too small\r\nto carry the load--to the now completely exhausted accumulators of the\r\n\"Forlorn Hope.\" All high-tension apparatus was shielded and grounded,\r\nso that no stray impulses could reveal to the possible detectors of\r\nthe Jovians the presence of this foreign power plant. Housings, frames,\r\nspiders, all stationary parts were rough, crude and massive; but\r\nbearings, shafts, armatures, all moving parts, were of a polished\r\nand finished accuracy and balance that promised months and years of\r\ntrouble-free operation. Everything ready for the test, Stevens took off\r\nhis frayed and torn leather coveralls and moccasins and climbed nimbly\r\nup the penstock. He never walked down. Opening the head-gate, he poised\r\nsharply upon its extremity and took off in a perfect swan-dive; floating\r\nunconcernedly down toward that boiling maelstrom two hundred feel below.\r\nHe struck the water with a sharp, smooth \"slup!\" and raced ashore,\r\nseizing his suit as he ran toward the turbo-alternator. It was running\r\nsmoothly, and, knowing that everything was tight at the receiving end,\r\nhe lingered about the power plant until he was assured that nothing\r\nwould go wrong and that his home manufactured lubricating oil and grease\r\nwould keep those massive bearings cool.\r\n\r\nHunger assailed him, and glancing at the sun, he noted that it was well\r\npast dinner-time.\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"The boss just loves to wait meals--she'll\r\nburn me up for this!\"\r\n\r\nHe ran lightly toward \"home,\" eager to tell his sweetheart that the\r\nlong awaited moment had arrived--that power was now flowing into their\r\naccumulators.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Diana of the silver bow!\" he called. \"How come you no blow the\r\ndinner bell? Power's on--come give it a look!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer to his hail, and Stevens paused in shocked\r\namazement. He knew that never of her own volition would she be out so\r\nlate--Nadia was gone! A rapid tour of inspection quickly confirmed that\r\nwhich he already knew only too well. Forgotten was his hunger, forgotten\r\nthe power plant, forgotten everything except the fact that his Nadia,\r\nthe buoyant spirit in whom centered his Universe, was lost or ... he\r\ncould not complete the thought, even to himself.\r\n\r\nSwiftly he came to a decision and threw off his suit, revealing the\r\nbody of a Hercules--a body ready for any demand he could put upon it.\r\nAlways in hard training, months of grinding physical labor and of heavy\r\neating had built him up to a point at which he would scarcely have\r\nrecognized himself, could he have glanced into a mirror. Mighty but\r\npliable muscles writhed and swelled under his clear skin as he darted\r\nhere and there, selecting equipment for what lay ahead of him. He donned\r\nthe heavily armored space-suit which they had prepared months before,\r\nwhile they were still suspicious of possible attack. It was covered with\r\nheavy steel at every point, and the lenses of the helmet, already of\r\nunbreakable glass, had been re-enforced with thick steel bars. Tank and\r\nvalves supplied air at normal pressure, so that his powerful body could\r\nfunction at full efficiency, not handicapped by the lighter atmosphere\r\nof Ganymede. The sleeves terminated in steel-protected rubber wristlets\r\nwhich left his hands free, yet sheltered from attack--wristlets tight\r\nenough to maintain the difference in pressure, yet not tight enough\r\nto cut off the circulation. He took up his mighty war-bow and the full\r\nquiver of heavy arrows--full-feathered and pointed with savagely barbed,\r\ntearing heads of forged steel--and slipped into their sheaths the long\r\nand heavy razor-sharp sword and the double-edged dirk, which he had\r\nmade and ground long since for he knew not what emergency, and whose\r\nbell-shaped hilts of steel further protected his hands and wrists.\r\nThus equipped, he had approximately his normal earthly weight; a fact\r\nwhich would operate to his advantage, rather than otherwise, in case\r\nof possible combat. With one last look around the \"Forlorn Hope,\" whose\r\nevery fitting spoke to him of the beloved mistress who was gone, he\r\nfilled a container with water and cooked food and opened the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It won't be long now; now it won't be long.\" Nadia caroled happily,\r\nbuckling on her pack straps and taking up bow and arrows for her daily\r\nhunt. \"I never thought that he could do it, but what it takes to do\r\nthings, he's got lots of,\" she continued to improvise the song as she\r\nleft the \"Hope\" with its multitudinous devices whose very variety was\r\na never-failing delight to her; showing as it did the sheer ability of\r\nthe man, whose brain and hands had almost finished a next-to-impossible\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nThrough the canyon and up a well-worn trail she climbed, and soon came\r\nout upon the sparsely timbered bench that was her hunting grounds. Upon\r\nthis day, however, she was full of happy anticipation and her mind was\r\neverywhere except upon her work. She was thinking of Stevens, of their\r\nlove, of the power which he might turn on that very day, and of the\r\npossible rescue for which she had hitherto scarcely dared to hope.\r\nThus it was that she walked miles beyond her usual limits without\r\nhaving loosed an arrow, and she was surprised when she glanced up at\r\nthe sun to see that half the morning was gone and that she was almost\r\nto the foothills, beyond which rose a towering range of mountains.\r\n\r\n\"Snap out of it, girl!\" she reprimanded herself. \"Go on wool-gathering\r\nlike this and your man will go hungry--and he'll break you right off\r\nat the ankles!\" She became again the huntress, and soon saw an animal\r\nbrowsing steadily along the base of a hill. It was a six-legged,\r\ndeer-like creature, much larger than anything she had as yet seen. But\r\nit was meat and her time was short, therefore she crept within range\r\nand loosed an arrow with the full power of her hunting bow. Unfamiliar\r\nas she was with the anatomy of the peculiar creature, the arrow did\r\nnot kill. The \"hexaped,\" as she instantly named it, sped away and she\r\nleaped after it. She, like her companion, had developed amazingly in\r\nmusculature, and few indeed were the denizens of Ganymede, who could\r\nequal her speed upon that small globe, with its feeble gravitational\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nUp the foothills it darted. Beyond the hills and deep into a valley\r\nbetween two towering peaks the chase continued before Nadia's third\r\narrow brought the animal down. Bending over the game, she became\r\nconscious of a strange but wonderful sweet perfume and glanced up,\r\nto see something which she certainly had not noticed when the hexaped\r\nhad fallen. It was an enormous flower, at least a foot in diameter and\r\nindescribably beautiful in its crimson and golden splendor. Almost level\r\nwith her head the gorgeous blossom waved upon its heavy stem; based\r\nby a massive cluster of enormous, smooth, dark green leaves. Entranced\r\nby this unexpected and marvelous floral display, Nadia breathed deeply\r\nof the inviting fragrance--and collapsed senseless upon the ground.\r\nThereupon the weird plant moved over toward her, and the thick leaves\r\nbegan to enfold her knees. This carnivorous thing, however, did not like\r\nthe heavy cloth of her suit and turned to the hexaped. It thrust several\r\nof its leaves into the wounds upon the carcass and fed, while two other\r\nleaves rasped together, sending out a piercing call.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the sound the underbrush crackled, and through it and upon\r\nthe scene there crashed a vegetable-animal nightmare--the parent of the\r\nrelatively tiny thing whose perfume had disabled the girl.\r\n\r\nIts huge and gorgeous blossom was supported by a long, flexible,\r\nwrithing stem, and its base was composed of many and highly specialized\r\nleaves. There were saws and spears and mighty, but sinuous tendrils;\r\nthere were slender shoots which seemed to possess some sense of\r\nperception; there was the massive tractor base composed of extensible\r\nleaves which by their contraction and expansion propelled the mass along\r\nthe ground. Parent and child fell upon the hexaped and soon bones and\r\nhair were all that remained The slender shoots then wandered about the\r\nunconscious girl in her strange covering, and as a couple of powerful\r\ntendrils coiled about her and raised her into the air over the monstrous\r\nbase of the thing, its rudimentary brain could almost be perceived\r\nworking as it sluggishly realized that, now full fed, it should carry\r\nthis other victim along, to feed its other offspring when they should\r\nreturn to its side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarely outside the door of the \"Forlorn Hope\" Stevens whirled about\r\nwith a bitter imprecation. He had already lost time needlessly--with a\r\nlookout plate he could cover more ground in ten minutes than he could\r\ncover afoot in a week. He flipped on the power and shot the violet beam\r\nout over the plateau to the district where he knew Nadia was wont to\r\nhunt. Not finding her there, he swung the beam in an ever widening\r\ncircle around that district. Finally he saw a few freshly broken twigs,\r\nand scanned the scene with care. He soon found the trail of fresh\r\nblood which marked the path of the flight of the hexaped, and with the\r\npeculiar maneuverability of the device he was using, it was not long\r\nuntil he was studying the scene where the encounter had taken place.\r\nHe gasped when he saw the bones and perceived three of Nadia's arrows,\r\nbut soon saw that the skeleton was not human and was reassured. Casting\r\nabout in every direction, he found Nadia's bow, and saw a peculiar,\r\nfreshly trampled path leading from the kill, past the bow, down the\r\nvalley. He could not understand the spoor, but it was easily followed,\r\nand he shot the beam along it at headlong speed until he came up with\r\nthe monstrous creature that was making it--until he saw what burden that\r\norganism was carrying.\r\n\r\nHe leaped to the controls of the lifeboat, then dropped his hand. While\r\nthe stream of power now flowing was ample to operate the lookout plates,\r\nyet it would be many hours before the accumulator cells would be in\r\ncondition to drive the craft even that short distance.\r\n\r\n\"It'll take over an hour to get there--here's hoping I can check in all\r\nx,\" he muttered savagely, as he took careful note of the location and\r\ndirection of the creature's trail and set off at a fast jog-trot.\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous flower's first warning that all was not well was\r\nreceived when Stevens' steel-shod feet landed squarely upon its base\r\nand one sweeping cut of his sword lopped off the malignant blossom and\r\nsevered the two tendrils that still held the unconscious Nadia. With a\r\nquick heave of his shoulder, he tossed her lightly backward into the\r\nsmooth-beaten track the creature had made and tried to leap away--but\r\nthe instant he had consumed in rescuing the girl had been enough for the\r\nthing to seize him, and he found himself battling for his very life. No\r\nsoft-leaved infant this, but a full-grown monster, well equipped with\r\nmighty weapons of offense and defense. Well it was for the struggling\r\nman that he was encased in armor steel as those saw-edged, hard-spiked\r\nleaves drove against him with crushing force; well it was for him that\r\nhe had his own independent air supply, so that that deadly perfume\r\neddied ineffective about his helmeted head! Hard and fiercely driven as\r\nthose terrible thorns were, they could do no more than dent his heavy\r\narmor. His powerful left arm, driving the double-razor-edged dirk in\r\nshort, resistless arcs, managed to keep the snaky tendrils from coiling\r\nabout his right arm, which was wielding the heavy, trenchant sword.\r\nEvery time that mighty blade descended it cleaved its length through\r\nsnapping spikes and impotently grinding leaves; but more than once\r\na flailing tendril coiled about his neck armor and held his helmet\r\nimmovable as though in a vise, while those frightful, grinding saws\r\nsought to rip their way through the glass to the living creature inside\r\nthe peculiar metal housing. Dirk and saber and magnificent physique\r\nfinally triumphed, but it was not until each leaf was literally severed\r\nfrom every other leaf that the outlandish organism gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNadia had been tossed out into pure air, beyond the zone of the\r\nstupefying perfume, and she recovered her senses in time to see the\r\nfinish of the battle. Stevens, assured that his foe was _hors du\r\ncombat_, turned toward the spot where he had thrown Nadia's body. He saw\r\nthat she was unharmed, and sprang toward her in relief. He was surprised\r\nbeyond measure, however, to see her run away at a pace he could not hope\r\nto equal, encumbered as he was; motioning frantically at him the while\r\nto keep away from her. He stopped, astounded, and started to unscrew his\r\nhelmet, whereupon she dashed back toward him, signaling him emphatically\r\nto leave his armor exactly as it was. He stood still and stared at her,\r\nan exasperated question large upon his face, until she made clear to\r\nhim that he was to follow her at a safe distance, then she set off at a\r\nrapid walk. She led him back to where the hexaped had fallen, where she\r\nretrieved her bow and arrows; then, keeping a sharp lookout upon all\r\nsides, she went on to a small stream of water. She made the dumbfounded\r\nman go out into the middle of the creek and lie down and roll over\r\nin the water, approaching him sniffing cautiously between immersions.\r\nShe made him continue the bathing until she could detect not even the\r\nslightest trace of the sweet, but noxious fragrance of that peculiarly\r\nterrible form of Ganymedean life. Only then did she allow him to remove\r\nhis helmet, so that she could give him the greeting for which they both\r\nhad longed and tell him what it was all about.\r\n\r\n\"So that's it, ace!\" he exclaimed, still holding her tightly in his iron\r\nembrace. \"Great balls of fire! I thought maybe you were still a little\r\ncuckoo. Anaesthetic perfume, huh? Hot stuff, I'd say--no wonder you\r\nbit--I would, too. It's lucky for us I was air-tight--we'd both be\r\nfee....\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!\" she interrupted him sharply, \"Forget it--don't ever even\r\nthink of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"All x, ace. It's out like the well known light. What to do? It's\r\ngetting darker than a hat, and we're a long way from home. Don't know\r\nwhether I could find my way back in the dark or not; and just between\r\nyou and me, I'm not particularly keen on night travel in these parts\r\nafter what's just happened. Are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else but,\" she assured him, fervently. \"I'd lots rather stay\r\nhungry until tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No need of that--I've brought along enough supper for both of us. I'm\r\nhungry as a wolf, too, now that I have time to think of it. We'll eat\r\nand den up somewhere--or climb a tree. Those wampuses probably can't\r\nclimb trees!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a nice little cave back there about a hundred meters. We'll\r\npretend it's the Ritz,\" and they soon had a merry fire blazing in front\r\nof the retreat. There they ate of the provisions Stevens had brought.\r\nThen, while the man rolled up boulders before the narrow entrance of\r\nthe cave, Nadia gathered leaves and made a soft bed upon its warm,\r\ndry floor.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, lover,\" and the girl, untroubled and secure now that\r\nStevens was at her side, was almost instantly asleep; but the man was\r\nnot sleepy. He thought of the power plant, even now sending its terrific\r\nstream of energy into his accumulators. He thought of the ultra\r\nradio--where could he get all the materials needed? He thought of his\r\nfriends, wondering whether or not they would receive his message. He\r\nthought of Breckenridge and the other human beings who had been aboard\r\nthe _Arcturus_, wondering poignantly as to their fate. He thought of\r\nNewton and of his own people, who had certainly given them up for dead\r\nlong since.\r\n\r\nBut above all he thought of the beautiful, steel-true companion lying\r\nthere asleep at his mailed feet, and he gazed down at her, his heart in\r\nhis eyes. The firelight shone through the chinks between the boulders,\r\ncasting a flickering ruddy light throughout the little cavern. Nadia lay\r\nthere her head pillowed upon one strong, brown little hand. Her lips\r\nwere red and sweetly curved, her cheek was smooth and firm as so much\r\nbrown velvet. She was literally aglow with sheer beauty and with perfect\r\nhealth; and the man reflected, as he studied her hungrily, that this\r\nwild life certainly had agreed with her--she was becoming more\r\nsurpassingly beautiful with every passing day.\r\n\r\n\"You little trump--you wonderful, lovely, square little brick!\" he\r\nbreathed silently, and bent over to touch her cheek lightly with his\r\nlips. Slight as the caress was, it disturbed her, and even in her sleep\r\nher subconscious mind sent out an exploring hand, to touch her Steve and\r\nthus be reassured. He pressed her hand and she settled back comfortably,\r\nwith a long, deep breath; and he stretched his iron-clad length beside\r\nher and closed his eyes, firmly resolved not to waste a minute of this\r\nwonderful night in sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened them an instant later, it was broad daylight, the\r\nboulders had been rolled away, the fragrance of roasting meat permeated\r\nthe atmosphere, and Nadia was making a deafening clamor, beating his\r\nsteel breastplate lustily with the flat of his huge saber.\r\n\r\n\"Daylight in the swamp, you sleeper!\" she exclaimed. \"Roll out or roll\r\nup! Come and get it, before I throw it away!\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have been kind of tired,\" he said sheepishly, when he saw that\r\nshe had shot a bird and had cooked breakfast for them both while he had\r\nbeen buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Peculiar, too, isn't it?\" Nadia asked, pointedly. \"You only did\r\nabout ten days' work yesterday in ten minutes, swinging this frightful\r\nsnickersnee of yours. Why, you played with it as though it were a\r\nknitting-needle, and when I wanted to wake you up with it, I could\r\nhardly lift it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thought you didn't want that subject even mentioned?\" he tried to steer\r\nthe talk away from his prowess with the broadsword.\r\n\r\n\"That was yesterday,\" airily. \"Besides, I don't mind talking about\r\nyou--it's thinking about us being ... you know ... that I can't stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x, ace. I get you right. Let's eat.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, they started down the valley, Stevens carrying his\r\nhelmet under his arm. Hardly had they started however, than Nadia's keen\r\neyes saw a movement through the trees, and, she stopped and pointed.\r\nStevens looked once, then hand in hand they dashed back to their cave.\r\n\r\n\"We'll pile up some of the boulders and you lie low,\" he instructed her\r\nas he screwed on his helmet. She snapped open his face-plate.\r\n\r\n\"But what about you? Aren't you coming in, too?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Can't--they'd surround us and starve us out. I'm safe in this\r\narmor--thank Heaven we made it as solid as we did--and I'll fight 'em in\r\nthe open. I'll show 'em what the bear did to the buckwheat!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I guess, but I wish I had my armor, too,\" she mourned as he\r\nsnapped shut his plate and walled her into the cave with the same great\r\nrocks he had used the night before. Then, Nadia safe from attack, he\r\ndrew his quiver of war-arrows into position over his shoulder, placed\r\none at the ready on his bow-string and turned to face the horde of\r\nthings rushing up the valley toward him. Wild animals he had supposed\r\nthem, but as he stood firm and raised his weapon shrill whistles\r\nsounded in the throng, and he gasped as he realized that those frightful\r\ncreatures must be intelligent beings, for not only did they signal\r\nto each other, but he saw that they were armed with bows and arrows,\r\nspears, and slings!\r\n\r\nSix-limbed creatures they were, of a purplish-red color, with huge,\r\ntricornigerous heads and with staring, green, phosphorescent eyes. Two\r\nof the six limbs were always legs, two always arms; the intermediate\r\ntwo, due to a mid-section jointing of the six-foot-long, almost\r\ncylindrical body, could be used at will as either legs or arms. Now, out\r\nof range, as they supposed, they halted and gathered about one who was\r\napparently their leader; some standing erect and waving four hands while\r\nshaking their horns savagely in Stevens' direction, others trotting\r\naround on four legs, busily gathering stones of suitable size for their\r\nvicious slings.\r\n\r\nToo far away to use their own weapons and facing only one small\r\nfour-limbed creature, they considered their game already in the bag, but\r\nthey had no comprehension of earthly muscles, nor any understanding of\r\nthe power and range of a hundred-pound bow driving a steel-headed war\r\narrow. Thus, while they were arguing, Stevens took the offensive, and\r\na cruelly barbed steel war-head tore completely through the body of\r\ntheir leader and mortally wounded the creature next beyond him. Though\r\nsurprised, they were not to be frightened off, but with wild, shrill\r\nscreams rushed to the attack. Stevens had no ammunition to waste, and\r\nevery time that mighty bow twanged a yard-long arrow transfixed at least\r\none of the red horde--and a body through which had torn one of those\r\nghastly, hand-forged arrow-heads was of very little use thereafter.\r\nAccurately-sped arrows splintered harmlessly against the re-enforced\r\nwindows of his helmet and against the steel guards protecting his hands.\r\nHe was almost deafened by the din as the stone missiles of the slingers\r\nrebounded from his reverberating shell of steel, but he fired carefully,\r\nsteadily, and powerfully until his last arrow had been loosed. Then,\r\nthe wicked dirk in his left hand and the long and heavy saber weaving\r\na circular path of brilliance in the sun, he stepped forward a couple\r\nof paces to meet the attackers. For a few moments nothing could stand\r\nbefore that fiercely driven blade--severed heads, limbs, and fragments\r\nof torsos literally filled the air, but sheer weight of numbers\r\nbore him down. As he fell, he saw the white shaft of one of Nadia's\r\nhunting-arrows flash past his helmet and bury itself to the flock in\r\nthe body of one of the horde above him. Nadia knew that her arrows could\r\nnot harm her lover, and through a chink between two boulders she was\r\nshooting into the thickest of the mob speeding her light arrows with\r\nthe full power of her bow.\r\n\r\nThough down, the savages soon discovered that Stevens was not out. In\r\nsuch close quarters he could not use his sword, but the fourteen-inch\r\nblade of the dirk, needle-pointed as it was and with two razor-sharp,\r\nserrated cutting edges, was itself no mean weapon, and time after time\r\nhe drove it deep, taking life at every thrust. Four more red monsters\r\nthrew themselves upon the prostrate man, but not sufficiently versed in\r\narmor to seek out its joints, their fierce short spear thrusts did no\r\ndamage. Presently four more corpses lay still and Stevens, with his,\r\nto them incredible, earthly strength, was once more upon his feet in\r\nspite of their utmost efforts to pinion his mighty limbs, and was again\r\nswinging his devastating weapon. Half their force lying upon the field,\r\nwiped out by a small, but invincible and apparently invulnerable being,\r\nthe remainder broke and ran, pursued by Stevens to the point where the\r\nred monsters had first halted. He recovered his arrows and returned to\r\nthe cave, opening his face-plate as he came.\r\n\r\n\"All x, sweetheart?\" he asked, rolling away the boulders. \"Didn't get\r\nanything through to you, did they?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they didn't even realize that I was taking part in the battle, I\r\nguess. Did they hurt you while they had you down? I was scared to death\r\nfor a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the old armor held. One of them must have gnawed on my ankle\r\nsome, between the greave and the heel-plate, but he couldn't quite get\r\nthrough. 'Sa darn small opening there, too--must have bent my foot\r\n'way around to get in at all. Have to tighten that joint up a little,\r\nI guess. I'll bet I've got a black spot and blue spot there the size of\r\nmy hand--maybe it's only the size of yours, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't die of that, probably. Heavens, Steve, that cleaver of yours\r\nis a frightful thing in action! Suppose it's safe for us to go home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely--right now is the best chance we'll ever have, and something\r\ntells me that we'd better make it snappy. They'll be back, and next time\r\nthey won't be so easy to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x, then--hold me, Steve, I can't stand the sight of that---let\r\nalone wade through it. I'm going to faint or something, sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you were!\" he snapped. \"You aren't going to pass out now that it's\r\nall over! It's a pretty ghastly mess, I know, but shut your eyes and\r\nI'll carry you out of sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't we out of sight of that place yet?\" she demanded after a time.\r\n\r\n\"I have been for quite a while,\" he confessed, \"but you're sitting\r\npretty, aren't you? And you aren't very heavy--not here on Ganymede,\r\nanyway!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Put me down!\" she commanded. \"After that crack I won't play with you\r\nany more at all--I'll pick up my marbles and go home!\"\r\n\r\nHe released her and they hurried hack toward their waterfall, keeping\r\nwary eyes sharp-set for danger in any form, animal or vegetable. On the\r\nway back across the foothills Stevens shot another hexaped, and upon the\r\nplateau above the river Nadia bagged several birds and small animals,\r\nbut it was not until they were actually in their own little canyon that\r\ntheir rapid pace slackened and their vigilance relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"After this, ace, we hunt together and we go back to wearing armor while\r\nwe're hunting. It scared me out of a year's growth when you checked\r\nup missing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sure do, Steve,\" she concurred emphatically. \"I'm not going to get\r\nmore than a meter away from you from now on. What do you suppose those\r\nhorrible things are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those flowers aren't like anything Tellus ever saw, so we have no basis\r\nof comparison. They may be a development of a flycatching plant, or they\r\nmay be a link between the animal and the vegetable kingdom. However,\r\nwe don't intend to study 'em, so let's forget 'em. Those animals were\r\nundoubtedly intelligent beings; they probably are a race of savages of\r\nthis satellite.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the really civilized races are probably....\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily--there may well be different types, each struggling\r\ntoward civilization. They certainly are on Venus, and they once were on\r\nMars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why haven't we seen anything like that before, in all these months?\r\nThings have been so calm and peaceful that we thought we had the whole\r\nworld to ourselves, as far as danger or men were concerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"We never saw them before because we never went where they lived--you\r\nwere a long ways from your usual stamping-grounds, you know. That\r\nanimal-vegetable flower is probably a high-altitude organism, living\r\nin the mountains and never coming as low as we are down here. As for\r\nthe savages--whatever they are--they probably never come within five\r\nkilometers of the falls. Many primitive peoples think that waterfalls\r\nare inhabited by demons, and maybe these folks are afflicted the same\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know much about our new world yet, do we?\"\r\n\r\n\"We sure don't--and I'm not particularly keen on finding out much more\r\nabout it until we get organized for trouble, either. Well, here we\r\nare--just like getting back home to see the 'Hope,' isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It _is_ home, and will be until we get one of our own on earth,\" and\r\nafter Stevens had read his meters, learning with satisfaction that the\r\nfull current was still flowing into the accumulators, he began to cut\r\nup the meat.\r\n\r\n\"Now that you've got the power-plant running at last, what next?\" asked\r\nNadia, piling the cuts in the freezer.\r\n\r\n\"Brandon's ultra-radio comes next, but it's got more angles to it than\r\na cubist's picture of a set of prisms; so many that I don't know where\r\nto begin. There, that job's done--let's sit down and I'll talk at you\r\nawhile. Maybe between us we can figure out where to start. I've got\r\neverything to build it lined up except for the tube, but that's got me\r\nstopped cold. You see, fields of force are all right in most places, but\r\nI've got to have one tube, and it's got to have the hardest possible\r\nvacuum. That means a mercury-vapor super pump. Mercury is absolutely\r\nthe only thing that will do the trick and the mercury is one thing\r\nthat is conspicuous by its absence in these parts. So are tungsten for\r\nfilaments, tantalum for plates, and platinum for leads; and I haven't\r\nfound anything that I can use as a getter, either--a metal, you know, to\r\nflash inside the tube to clean up the last traces of atmosphere in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't suppose that such a simple thing as a radio tube could hold\r\nyou up, after the perfectly unbelievable things that you have done\r\nalready--but I see now how it could. Of course, the tubes in our\r\nreceiver over there are too small?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are only receiver and communicator tubes, and I need a\r\nhigh-power transmitting tube--a fifty-kilowatter, at least. I'd give\r\nmy left leg to the knee joint for one of those big water-cooled,\r\nsixty-kilowatt ten-nineteens right now--it would save us a lot of\r\ngrief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you could break up those tubes and use the plates and so on?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought of that, but it won't work--there isn't half enough metal\r\nin the lot, and the filaments in particular are so tiny that I couldn't\r\npossibly work them over into a big one. Then, too, we haven't got\r\nmany spare tubes, and if I smash the ones we're using, I put our\r\ncommunicators out of business for good, so that we can't yell for help\r\nif we have to drift home--and I still don't get any mercury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to tell me there's no mercury on this whole planet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly; but I do mean that I haven't been able to find any, and\r\nthat it's probably darned scarce. And since all the other metals I want\r\nworst are also very dense and of high atomic weight, they're probably\r\nmighty scarce here, too. Why? Because we're on a satellite, and no\r\nmatter what hypothesis you accept for the origin of satellites, you come\r\nto the same conclusion--that heavy metals are either absent or most\r\nawfully scarce and buried deep down toward the center. There are lots of\r\nheavy metals in Jupiter somewhere, but we probably couldn't find them.\r\nJupiter's atmosphere is one mass of fog, and we couldn't see, since we\r\nhaven't got an infra-red transformer. I could build one, in time, but\r\nit would take quite a while--and we couldn't work on Jupiter, anyway,\r\nbecause of its gravity and probably because of its atmosphere. And even\r\nif we could work there, we don't want to spend the rest of our lives\r\nprospecting for mercury.\" Stevens fell silent, brow wrinkled in thought.\r\n\r\n\"You mean, dear, that we're...\" Nadia broke off, the sentence\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, no! There's lots of things not tried yet, and we can always set\r\nout to drift it. I was thinking only of building the tube. And I'm\r\ntrying to think ... say, Nadia, what do you know about Cantrell's\r\nComet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing, except that I remember reading in the newspapers that it\r\nwas peculiar for something or other. But what has Cantrell's Comet got\r\nto do with the high cost of living--or with radio tubes? Have you gone\r\ncuckoo all of a sudden?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be surprised!\" Stevens grinned at her puzzled expression.\r\n\"Cantrell's Comet is one of Jupiter's comet family and is peculiar in\r\nbeing the most massive one known to science. It was hardly known until\r\nafter they built those thousand-foot reflectors on the Moon, where the\r\nseeing is always perfect, but it has been studied a lot since then.\r\nIts nucleus is small, but extremely heavy--it seems to have an average\r\ndensity of somewhere around sixteen. There's platinum and everything\r\nelse that's heavy there, girl! They ought to be there in such quantity\r\nthat even such a volunteer chemist as I am could find them!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Steve!\" A look of alarm flashed over Nadia's face, then\r\ndisappeared as rapidly as it had come into being. \"But of course, comets\r\naren't really dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure not. A comet's tail, which so many people are afraid of as being\r\npoison gas, is almost a perfect vacuum, even at its thickest, and we'd\r\nhave to wear space-suits anyway. And speaking of vacuum ... whoopee!\r\nWe don't need mercury any more than a goldfish needs a gas-mask. When\r\nwe get Mr. Tube done, we'll take him out into space, leaving his mouth\r\nopen, and very shortly he'll be as empty as a flapper's skull. Then\r\nwe'll seal him up, flash him out, come back here, and start spilling\r\nour troubles into Brandon's shell-like ear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful, Steve! You do get an idea occasionally, don't you? But how\r\ndo we get out there? Where is this Cantrell's Comet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, exactly--there's one rub. Another is that I haven't\r\neven started the transmitter and receptor units. But we've got some\r\nfield-generators here on board that I can use, so it won't be so bad.\r\nAnd our comet is in this part of the solar system somewhere fairly\r\nclose. Wish we had an Ephemeris, a couple of I-P solar charts, and\r\na real telescope.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't do much without an Ephemeris, I should think. It's a good\r\nthing you kept the chronometers going. You know the I-P time, day, and\r\ndates, anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to do without some things, that's all,\" and the man stared\r\nabsently at the steel wall. \"I remember something about its orbit, since\r\nit is one thing that all I-P vessels have to steer clear of. Think I can\r\nfigure it close enough so that we'll be able to find it in our little\r\ntelescope, or even on our plate, since we'll be out of this atmosphere.\r\nAnd it might not be a bad idea for us to get away, anyway. I'm afraid of\r\nthose folks on that space-ship, whoever they were, and they must live\r\naround here somewhere. Cantrell's Comet swings about fifty million\r\nkilometers outside Jupiter's orbit at aphelion--close enough for us to\r\nreach, and yet probably too far for them to find us easily. By the time\r\nwe get back here, they probably will have quit looking for us, if they\r\nlook at all. Then too, I expect these savages to follow us up. What say,\r\nlittle ace--do we try it or do we stay here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know best, Steve. As I said before, I'm with you from now on, in\r\nwhatever you think best to do. I know that you think it best to go out\r\nthere. Therefore, so do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, finally, \"I'd better get busy, then--there's a lot to\r\ndo before we can start. The radio doesn't come next, after all--the\r\ntransmitter and receptor units come ahead of it. They won't mean\r\nwasted labor, in any event, since we'll have to have them in case the\r\nradio fails. You'd better lay in a lot of supplies while I'm working\r\non that stuff, but don't go out of sight, and yell like fury if\r\nyou see anything. We'd both better wear full armor every time we go\r\nout-of-doors--unless I'm all out of control we aren't done with those\r\nsavages yet. Even though they may be afraid of the demons of the falls,\r\nI think they'll have at least one more try at us.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Nadia brought in meat and vegetables and stored them away,\r\nStevens attacked the problem of constructing the pair of tight-beam,\r\nauto-dirigible transmitter and receptor units which would connect his\r\ngreat turbo-alternator to the accumulators of their craft, wherever it\r\nmight be in space. From the force-field generators of the \"Forlorn Hope\"\r\nhe selected the two most suitable for his purpose, tuned them to the\r\nexact frequency he required, and around them built a complex system of\r\ncondensers and coils.\r\n\r\nDay after day passed. Their larder was full, the receptor was finished,\r\nand the beam transmitter was almost ready to attach to the\r\nturbo-alternator before the calm was broken.\r\n\r\n\"Steve!\" Nadia shrieked. Glancing idly into the communicator plate, she\r\nhad been perfunctorily surveying the surrounding territory. \"They're\r\ncoming! Thousands of them! They're all over the bench up there, and just\r\nsimply pouring down the hills and up the valley!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish they'd waited a few hours longer--we'd have been gone. However,\r\nwe're just about ready for them,\" he commented grimly, as he stared over\r\nher shoulder into the communicator plate. \"We'll make a lot of those\r\nIndians wish that they had stayed at home with their papooses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got all those rays and things fixed up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as many as I'd like to have. You see, I don't know the composition\r\nof the I-P ray, since it is outlawed to everybody except the police.\r\nOf course I could have found out from Brandon, but never paid any\r\nattention to it. I've got some nice ultra-violet, though, and a short-wave\r\noscillatory that'll cook an elephant to a cinder in about eight seconds.\r\nWe'll keep them amused, no fooling! Glad we had time to cover our open\r\nsides, and it looks as though that meteorite armor we put over the\r\nprojectors may be mighty useful, too.\"\r\n\r\nOn and on the savages came, massed in formations showing some signs of\r\nrude discipline. This time there was neither shrieking nor yelling; the\r\nweird creatures advanced silently and methodically. Here and there were\r\nmassed groups of hundreds, dragging behind them engines which Stevens\r\nstudied with interest.\r\n\r\n\"Hm ... m ... m. Catapults,\" he mused. \"You were right, girl of my\r\ndreams--armor and bows and arrows wouldn't help us much right now.\r\nThey're going to throw rocks at us that'll have both mass and momentum.\r\nWith those things they can cave in our side-armor, and might even dent\r\nour roof. When one of those projectiles hits, we want to know where it\r\nain't, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nStevens cast off the heavily-insulated plug connecting the power plant\r\nleads to his now almost fully charged accumulators, strapped himself and\r\nNadia into place at the controls, and waited, staring into the plate.\r\nCatapult after catapult was dragged to the lip of the little canyon,\r\nuntil six of them bore upon the target. The huge stranded springs of\r\nhair, fiber, and sinew were wound up to the limit, and enormous masses\r\nof rock were toilsomely rolled upon the platforms. Each \"gunner\" seized\r\nhis trip, and as the leader shrieked his signal the six ponderous masses\r\nof metalliferous rock heaved into the air as one. But they did not\r\nstrike their objective, for as the signal was given, Stevens shot\r\npower into his projectors. The \"Forlorn Hope\" leaped out of the canyon\r\nand high into the air over the open meadow, just as the six great\r\nprojectiles crashed into the ground upon the spot which, an instant\r\nbefore, she had occupied.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRudimentary discipline forgotten, the horde rushed down into the canyon\r\nand the valley, in full clamor of their barbaric urgings. Horns and\r\narms tossed fiercely, savage noises rent the air, and arrows splintered\r\nharmlessly upon steel plate as the mystified and maddened warriors upon\r\nthe plain below gave vent to their outraged feelings.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Nadia! A whole gang of them are smelling around that power plug.\r\nPretty soon somebody's going to touch a hot spot, and when he does,\r\nwe'll cut loose on the rest of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe huge insulating plug, housing the ends of the three great cables\r\nleading to the converters of the turbo-alternator, lay innocently upon\r\nthe ground, its three yawning holes invitingly open to savage arms. The\r\nchief, who had been inspecting the power-plant, walked along the triplex\r\nlead and joined his followers at its terminus. Pointing with his horns,\r\nhe jabbered orders and three red monsters, one at each cable, bent to\r\nlift the plug, while the leader himself thrust an arm into each of the\r\nthree contact holes. There was a flash of searing flame and the reeking\r\nsmoke of burning flesh--those three arms had taken the terrific no-load\r\nvoltage of the three-phase converter system, and the full power of the\r\nalternator had been shorted directly to ground through the comparatively\r\nsmall resistance of his body.\r\n\r\nStevens had poised the \"Forlorn Hope\" edgewise in mid-air, so that\r\nthe gleaming, heavily armored parabolic reflectors of his projectors,\r\nmounted upon the leading edge of the fortress, covered the scene below.\r\nAs the charred corpse of the savage chieftain dropped to the ground,\r\nit seemed to the six-limbed creatures that the demons of the falls had\r\nindeed been annoyed beyond endurance by their intrusion; for, as if in\r\nresponse to the flash of fire from the power plug, that structure so\r\npeculiarly and so stolidly hanging in the air came plunging down toward\r\nthem. From it there reached down twin fans of death and destruction: one\r\nflaming and almost invisibly incandescent violet which tore at the eyes\r\nand excruciatingly disintegrated brain and nervous tissues; the other\r\ndully glowing an equally invisible red, at the touch of which body\r\ntemperature soared to lethal heights and foliage burst cracklingly into\r\nspontaneous flame.\r\n\r\nIn their massed hundreds, the savages dropped where they stood, life\r\nrived away by the torturing ultra-violet, burned away by the blast\r\nof pure heat, or consumed by the conflagrations that raged instantly\r\nwherever that wide-sweeping fan encountered combustible material.\r\nIn the face of power supernatural they lost all thought of attack or of\r\nconquest, and sought only and madly to escape. Weapons were thrown away,\r\nthe catapults were abandoned, and, every man for himself, the mob fled\r\nin wildest disorder, each striving to put as much distance as possible\r\nbetween himself and that place of dread mystery, the waterfall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess that'll hold 'em for a while,\" Stevens dropped their\r\ncraft back into its original quarters in the canyon. \"Whether they ever\r\nbelieved before that this falls was inhabited by devils or not, they\r\nthink so now. I'll bet that it will be six hundred Jovian years before\r\nany of them ever come within a hundred kilometers of it again. I'm glad\r\nof it, too, because they'll let our power plant alone now. Well, let's\r\nget going--we've got to make things hum for a while!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why all the rush? You just said that we have scared them away for\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"The savages, yes, but not those others. We've just turned loose enough\r\nradiation to affect detectors all over the system, and it's up to us to\r\nget this beam projector set up, get away from here, and get our power\r\nshut off before they can trace us. Snap it up, ace!\"\r\n\r\nThe transmitter unit was installed at the converters, the cable was torn\r\nout, and, having broken the last material link between it and Ganymede,\r\nStevens hurled the \"Forlorn Hope\" out into space, using the highest\r\nacceleration Nadia could endure. Hour after hour the massive wedge of\r\nsteel bored outward, away from Jupiter; hour after hour Stevens' anxious\r\neyes scanned his instruments; hour after hour hope mounted and relief\r\ntook the place of anxiety as the screens remained blank throughout every\r\ninquiring thrust into the empty ether. But they knew they would have to\r\nkeep sharp vigilance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Continuing a Thrilling New Serial of Interplanetary Life and Travel\r\nby Edward E. Smith, Ph.D._\r\n\r\n_Author of \"Skylark of Space,\" and \"Skylark Three\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpacehounds of IPC\r\n\r\n\r\n    _One of the most fascinating mysteries of the heavens is the comet.\r\n    It goes through space, gets near enough to the earth to be seen,\r\n    and then goes off and disappears in celestial distance. Often it\r\n    has a hyperbolic orbit, which would make it impossible to come back.\r\n    Yet it may return--apparently contradicting the geometry of conic\r\n    sections. This only goes to prove once more that it is risky to say\r\n    anything is impossible--even that our hero of this story manages\r\n    beautifully, with the aid of Cantrell's Comet, to avoid complete\r\n    annihilation while stranded in interstellar space._\r\n\r\n    _Read \"what went before\" and then continue the second instalment._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Went Before:\r\n\r\n    The Interplanetary Vessel Arcturus sets out for Mars, with\r\n    Breckenridge as chief pilot, carrying on board, besides its\r\n    regular crew and some passengers, the famous Dr. Stevens,\r\n    designer of space ships and computer. He checks computations\r\n    made by astronomers stationed in floating observatories, and\r\n    after he has located any trouble and suggests a plan for\r\n    minimizing the hazards of the trip from the earth to Mars,\r\n    he reports his findings and suggestions to Mr. Newton, chief\r\n    of the Interplanetary Corporation.\r\n\r\n    Stevens then takes Nadia, Mr. Newton's beautiful young daughter,\r\n    on a specially conducted sight-seeing tour of the Arcturus and\r\n    thoroughly explains to her all of the works of the vessel. Nadia\r\n    has herself had a good science education. While they are down at\r\n    the bottom of the ship--nearing the end of their tour--Stevens\r\n    feels a barely perceptible movement of the vessel from its course.\r\n    When he turns on the visiplate, he is horrified to find that a\r\n    mysterious ray of unparalleled power has neatly sliced the Arcturus\r\n    in several places.\r\n\r\n    Nadia and Stevens are completely separated from the rest of the\r\n    crew and passengers of the ship, so they get into a lifeboat,\r\n    which is equipped for a limited amount of space travel. Despite\r\n    the strict and apparently effective vigilance of the enemy\r\n    destroyer, Stevens and Nadia make their getaway in the lifeboat,\r\n    which they aptly call \"Forlorn Hope,\" and finally make a safe\r\n    landing on Ganymede, where Stevens plans to build a power-plant\r\n    and a radio transmitter, to enable him to communicate with the\r\n    earth or with the IPV Sirius, which is used by Westfall and Brandon\r\n    (two of the world's best scientists) as a floating laboratory.\r\n\r\n    With the very scant apparatus and material available, Stevens\r\n    sets to work on his power plant. Just as they have it completed\r\n    and ready to start for Cantrell's Comet, where Stevens believes\r\n    he can obtain the necessary metal for his giant transmitting\r\n    tube, they experience a close call with carnivorous plants on the\r\n    satellite and later with savage inhabitants, which precipitates\r\n    their trip to the comet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCantrell's Comet\r\n\r\n\r\nFar out in space, Jupiter, a tiny moon and its satellites mere\r\npin-points of light, Stevens turned to his companion with a grin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nadia, old golf-shootist, here's where we turn spacehounds again.\r\nHope you like it better this time, because I'm afraid that we'll have to\r\nstay weightless for quite a while.\" He slowly throttled down the mighty\r\nflow of power, and watched the conflicting emotions play over Nadia's\r\nface in her purely personal battle against the sickening sensations\r\ncaused by the decrease in their acceleration.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry as the dickens, sweetheart,\" he went on, tenderly, and the\r\ngrin disappeared. \"Wish I could take it for you, but....\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are times when we've got to fight our own battles and bury\r\nour own dead,\" she interrupted, gamely. \"Cut off the rest of that power!\r\nI'm _not_ going to be sick--I _won't_ be a--what do you spacehounds call\r\nus poor earth-bound dubs who can't stand weightlessness--weight-fiends,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but you aren't....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I'm not, and I'm not going to be one, either! I'm all x,\r\nSteve--it's not so bad now, really. I held myself together that time,\r\nanyway, and I feel lots better now. Have you found Cantrell's Comet yet?\r\nAnd why so sure all of a sudden that they can't find us? That power beam\r\nstill connects us to Ganymede, doesn't it? Maybe they can trace it.\"\r\n\r\n\"At-a-girl, ace!\" he cheered. \"I'll tell the world you're no\r\nweight-fiend--you're a spacehound right. Most first-trippers, at this\r\nstage of the game, wouldn't be caring a whoop whether school kept or\r\nnot, and here you're taking an interest in all kinds of things already.\r\nYou'll do, girl of my heart--no fooling!\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe, and maybe you're trying to kid somebody,\" she returned, eyeing\r\nhim intently. \"Or maybe you just don't want to answer those questions\r\nI asked you a minute ago.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _At the bottom of a shaft a section of the rocky wall\r\nswung aside, revealing the yawning black mouth of a horizontal tunnel.\r\nAt intervals upon its roof there winked into being almost invisible\r\npoints of light. Along that line of lights the life-boats felt their\r\nway, coming finally into a huge cavern...._]\r\n\r\n\"No, that's straight data, right on zero across the panel,\" he assured\r\nher. \"And as for your questions, they're easy. No, I haven't looked for\r\nthe comet yet, because we'll have to drift for a couple of days before\r\nwe'll be anywhere near where I think it is. No, they can't trace us,\r\nbecause there is now nothing to trace, unless they can detect the\r\nslight power we are using in our lights and so on--which possibility is\r\nvanishingly small. Potentially, our beam still exists, but since we are\r\ndrawing no power, it has no actual present existence. See?\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh-uh,\" she dissented. \"I can't say that I can quite understand how\r\na beam can exist potentially and yet not be there actually enough to\r\ntrace. Why, a thing has to be actual or not exist at all--you can't\r\npossibly have something that is nothing. It doesn't make sense. But\r\nlay off those integrations of yours, please,\" as now armed with a\r\nslate-pencil, Stevens began to draw a diagram upon a four-foot sheet of\r\nsmooth slate. \"You know that your brand of math is over my head like a\r\ncircus tent, so we'll let it lie. I'll take your word for it. Steve--if\r\nyou're satisfied, it's all x with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can straighten you out a little, by analogy. Here's a rough\r\nsketch of a cylinder, with shade and shadow. You've had descriptive\r\ngeometry, of course, and so know that a shadow, being simply a\r\nprojection of a material object upon a plane, is a two-dimensional\r\nthing--or rather, a two-dimensional concept. Now take the shade, which\r\nis, of course, this entire figure here, between the cylinder casting\r\nthe shadow and the plane of projection. You simply imagine that there\r\nis a point source of light at your point of projection: it isn't really\r\nthere. The shade, then, of which I am drawing a picture, has only a\r\npotential existence. You know exactly where it is, you can draw it, you\r\ncan define it, compute it, and work with it--but still it doesn't exist;\r\nthere is absolutely nothing to differentiate it from any other volume of\r\nair, and it cannot be detected by any physical or mechanical means. If,\r\nhowever, you place a light at the point of projection, the shade becomes\r\nactual and can be detected optically. By a sufficient stretch of the\r\nimagination, you might compare our beam to that shade. When we turn our\r\npower on, the beam is actual; it is a stream of tangible force, and as\r\nsuch can be detected electrically. When our switches here are open,\r\nhowever, it exists only potentially. There is no motion in the ether,\r\nnothing whatever to indicate that a beam had ever actually existed\r\nthere. With me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Floundering pretty badly, but I see it after a fashion. You physicists\r\nare peculiar freaks--where we ordinary mortals see actual, solid,\r\nheavy objects, you see only empty space with a few electrons and things\r\nfloating around in it; and yet where we see only empty space, you can\r\nsee things 'potentially' that may never exist at all. You'll be the\r\ndeath of me yet, Steve! But I'm wasting a lot of time. What do we do\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"We get busy on the big tube. You might warm up the annealing oven and\r\nmelt me that pot of glass, while I get busy on the filament supports,\r\nplate brackets, and so on.\" Both fell to work with a will, and hours\r\npassed rapidly and almost silently, so intent was each upon his own\r\ntasks.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Steve.\" Nadia broke the long silence. \"The pyrometer's on the\r\nred, and the oven's hot,\" and the man left his bench. Taking up a long\r\npaddle and an even longer blowpipe, he skimmed the melt to a dazzlingly\r\nbright surface and deftly formed a bubble.\r\n\r\n\"I just love to talk at you when you've got your mouth full of a\r\nblowpipe.\" Nadia eyed him impishly and tucked her feet beneath her,\r\npoised weightless as she was. \"I've got you foul now--I can say anything\r\nI want to, and you can't talk back, because your bubble will lose its\r\nshape if you do. Oh, isn't that a beauty! I never saw you blow anything\r\nthat big before,\" and she fell silent, watching intently.\r\n\r\nSlowly there was being drawn from the pot a huge, tapering bulb of hot,\r\nglistening glass, its cross-section at the molten surface varying as\r\nStevens changed the rate of draw or the volume of air blown through the\r\npipe. Soon that section narrowed sharply. The glass-blower waved his\r\nhand and Nadia severed the form neatly with a glowing wire, just above\r\nthe fluid surface of the glass remaining in the pot. Pendant from the\r\nblowpipe, the bulb was placed over the hot-bench, where Stevens, now\r\nbegoggled, begloved, and armed with a welding torch, proceeded to fuse\r\ninto the still, almost plastic, glass sundry necks, side-tubes, supports\r\nand other attachments of peculiar pattern. Finally the partially\r\nassembled tube was placed in the annealing oven, where it would remain\r\nat a high and constant temperature until its filaments, grids, and\r\nplates had been installed. Eventually, in that same oven, it would be\r\nallowed to cool slowly and uniformly over a period of days.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus were performed many other tasks which are ordinarily done either\r\nby automatic machinery or by highly skilled specialists in labor--for\r\nthese two, thrown upon their own resources, had long since learned how\r\nmuch specialization may be represented by the most commonplace article.\r\nWhenever they needed a thing they did not have--which happened every\r\nday--they had either to make it or else, failing in that, to go back and\r\nbuild something that would enable them to manufacture the required item.\r\nSuch setbacks had become so numerous as to be expected as part of the\r\nday's work; they no longer caused exasperation or annoyance. For two\r\ndays the two jacks-of-all-trades worked at many lines and with many\r\nmaterials before Stevens called a halt.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Nadia. It's time for us to stop tinkering and turn into\r\nastronomers. We've been out for fifty I-P hours, and we'd better begin\r\nlooking around for our heap of scrap metal,\" and, the girl at the\r\ncommunicator plate and Stevens at their one small telescope, they began\r\nto search the black, star-jeweled heavens for Cantrell's Comet.\r\n\r\n\"According to my figures, it ought to be about four hours right\r\nascension, and something like plus twenty degrees declination. My\r\nfigures aren't accurate, though, since I'm working purely from memory,\r\nso we'd better cover everything from Aldebaran to the Pleiades.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the directions will change as we go along, won't they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless we pass it, because we're heading pretty nearly straight at\r\nit, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see anything interesting thereabouts except stars. Will it have\r\nmuch tail?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little--it's close to aphelion, you know, and a comet doesn't have\r\nmuch of a tail so far away from the sun. Hope it's got some of its tail\r\nleft, though, or we may miss it entirely.\"\r\n\r\nHours passed, during which the two observers peered intently into their\r\ninstruments, then Stevens left the telescope and went over to his slate.\r\n\r\n\"Looks bad, ace--we should have spotted it before this. Time to eat,\r\ntoo. You'd better....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look here, quick!\" Nadia interrupted. \"Here's something! Yes, it\r\n_is_ a comet, and quite close--it's got a little bit of a dim tail.\"\r\n\r\nStevens leaped to the communicator plate, and, blond head pressed close\r\nto brown, the two wayfarers studied the faint image of the wanderer of\r\nthe void.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, I just _know_ it is!\" Nadia declared. \"Steve, as a computer,\r\nyou're a blinding flash and a deafening report!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--missed it only about half a million kilometers or so,\" he\r\nreplied, grinning, \"and I'd fire a whole flock of I-P check stations\r\nfor being four thousand off. However, I could have done worse--I could\r\neasily have forgotten all the data on it, instead of only half of it.\"\r\nHe applied a normal negative acceleration, and Nadia heaved a profound\r\nsigh of relief as her weight returned to her and her body again became\r\nmanageable by the ordinary automatic and involuntary muscles.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I am a kind of a weight-fiend at that, Steve--this is much\r\nbetter!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody denies that weight is more convenient at times; but you're a\r\nspacehound just the same--you'll like it after a while,\" he prophesied.\r\n\r\nStevens took careful observations upon the celestial body, altered his\r\ncourse sharply, then, after a measured time interval, again made careful\r\nreadings.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, all x,\" he announced, after completing his calculations, and\r\nhe reduced their negative acceleration by a third. \"There--we'll be just\r\nabout traveling with it when we get there,\" he said. \"Now, little K. P.\r\nof my bosom, our supper's been on minus time for hours. What say we\r\nshake it up?\"\r\n\r\n\"I check you to nineteen decimals,\" and the two were soon attacking the\r\nsavory Ganymedean goulash which Nadia had put in the cooker many hours\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Should we both go to sleep, Steve, or should one of us watch it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sleep, by all means. There's no meteoric stuff out here, and we won't\r\narrive before ten o'clock tomorrow, I-P time,\" and, tired out by the\r\nevents of the long day, man and maid sought their beds and plunged into\r\ndreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nWhile they slept, the \"Forlorn Hope\" drove on through the void at a\r\nterrific but constantly decreasing velocity; and far off to one side,\r\nplunging along a line making a sharp angle with their own course, there\r\nloomed larger and larger the masses which made up the nucleus of\r\nCantrell's Comet.\r\n\r\nUpon awakening, Stevens' first thought was for the comet, and he\r\nobserved it carefully before he aroused Nadia, who hurried into the\r\ncontrol room. Looming large in the shortened range of the plate, their\r\nobjective hurtled onward in its eternal course, its enormous velocity\r\nbetrayed only by the rapidity with which it sped past the incredibly\r\nbrilliant background of infinitely distant stars. Apparently it was\r\na wild jumble of separate fragments; a conglomerate, heterogeneous\r\naggregation of rough and jagged masses varying in size from grains of\r\nsand up to enormous chunks, which upon Earth would have weighed millions\r\nof tons. Pervading the whole nucleus, a slow, indefinite movement was\r\nperceptible--a vague writhing and creeping of individual components\r\nworking and slipping past and around each other as they all rushed\r\nforward in obedience to the immutable cosmic law of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, isn't that wonderful!\" Nadia breathed. \"Think of actually going to\r\nvisit a comet! It sort of scares me, Steve--it's so creepy and crawly\r\nlooking. We're awfully close, aren't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very. We'd probably have lots of time to eat breakfast. But just\r\nto be on the safe side, maybe I'd better camp here at the board, and you\r\nbring me over something to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x, Chief!\" and Stevens ate, one eye upon the screen, watching\r\nclosely the ever-increasing bulk of the comet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor many minutes he swung the _Forlorn Hope_ in a wide curve approaching\r\nthe mountain of metal ever and ever more nearly, then turned to the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Hold everything, Nadia--power's going off in a minute!\" He shut off the\r\nbeam; then, noting that they were traveling a trifle faster than the\r\ncomet, he applied a small voltage to one dirigible projector. Darting\r\nthe beam here and there, he so corrected their flight that they were\r\nprecisely stationary in relation to the comet. He then opened his\r\nswitches, and the _Forlorn Hope_ hurtled on. Apparently motionless, it\r\nwas now a part of Cantrell's Comet, traveling in a stupendous, elongated\r\nellipse about the Master of our Solar System, the Sun.\r\n\r\n\"There, ace, who said anything about weight-fiends? I was watching you,\r\nand you never turned a hair that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's right--I never even thought about it--I was so busy\r\nstudying that thing out there! I suppose I've got used to it already?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--you're one of us now. I knew you would be. Well, let's go places\r\nand do things! You'd better put on a suit, too, so you can stand in the\r\nair-lock and handle the line.\"\r\n\r\nThey donned the heavily insulated, heated suits, and Stevens snapped the\r\nlocking plugs of the drag line into their sockets upon the helmets.\r\n\r\n\"Hear me?\" he asked. \"Sound-disks all x?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the radio--all x?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tested your tanks and heaters--they're all x. But you'll have to\r\ntest....\"\r\n\r\n\"I know the ritual by heart, Steve. It's been in every show in the\r\ncountry for the last year, but I didn't know you had to go through it\r\nevery time you went out-of-doors! Halves, number one all x, two all x,\r\nthree all x....\"\r\n\r\n\"Quit it!\" he snapped. \"You aren't testing those valves! That check-up\r\nis no joke, guy. These suits are complicated affairs, and some parts\r\nare apt to get out of order. You see, a thing to give you fresh air at\r\nnormal pressure and to keep you warm in absolute space can't be either\r\nsimple or fool-proof. They've worked on them for years, but they're\r\npretty crude yet. They're tricky, and if one goes sour on you, out in\r\nspace, it's just too bad--you're lucky to get back alive. A lot of men\r\nare still out there somewhere because of the sloppy check-ups.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Scuse it, please--I'll be good,\" and the careful checking and testing\r\nof every vital part of the space-suits went on.\r\n\r\nSatisfied at last that the armor was spaceworthy, Stevens picked up the\r\ncoils of drag-line, built of a non-metallic fiber which could retain its\r\nflexibility and strength in the bitter cold of outer space, and led the\r\ngirl into the air-lock.\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Steve! It's perfectly stupendous, and grinding around worse\r\nthan the wreckage of the _Arcturus_ was when I wouldn't let you climb\r\nup it--why, I thought comets were _little_, and hardly massive at all!\"\r\nexclaimed the girl.\r\n\r\n\"This is little, compared to any regular planet or satellite or even to\r\nthe asteroids. There's only a few cubic kilometers of matter there, and,\r\nas I said before, it's a decidedly unusual comet. You know the game?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got it--and believe me, I'll yank you back here a lot faster than\r\nyou can jump over there if any one of those lumps starts to fall on you!\r\nIs this drag line long enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I've got a hundred meters here, and it's only fifty meters over\r\nthere to where I'm going. So long,\" and with a light thrust of his feet,\r\nhe dove head foremost across the intervening space, a heavy pike held\r\nout ahead of him. Straight as a bullet he floated toward his objective,\r\na jagged chunk many yards in diameter, taking the shock of his landing\r\nby sliding along the pike-handle as its head struck the mass.\r\n\r\nThen, bracing his feet against one lump, he pushed against its neighbor,\r\nand under that steady pressure the enormous masses moved apart and kept\r\non moving, grinding among their fellows. Over and around them Stevens\r\nsprang, always watching his line of retreat as well as that of his\r\nadvance, until his exploring pike struck a lump of apparently solid\r\nmetal. Hooking the fragment toward him, he thrust savagely with his\r\nweapon and was reassured--that object was not only metal, but it was\r\nmetal so hard that his pike-head of space-tempered alloy steel did not\r\nmake an impression upon its surface. Turning on his helmet light he\r\nswung his heavy hammer repeatedly but could not break off even a small\r\nfragment.\r\n\r\n\"Found something, Steve?\" Nadia's voice came clearly in his ears.\r\n\r\n\"I'll say I have! A hunk of solid, non-magnetic metal about the size of\r\nan office desk. I can't break off any of it, so I guess we'll have to\r\ngrab the whole chunk.\"\r\n\r\nHe hitched the end of his cable around the nugget, made sure that the\r\nloops would not slip, and then, as Nadia tightened the line, he shoved\r\nmightily.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Nadia, she's coming! Pull in my drag line as I said over there,\r\nand I'll help you land her.\"\r\n\r\nInside the _Forlorn Hope_ the mass of metal was urged into the shop,\r\nwhere Stevens clamped it immovably to the steel floor, before he took\r\noff his space-suit.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's getting covered with snow, and the whole room is getting\r\npositively _cold_!\" Nadia exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Anything that comes in from space is cold, even if it's been out\r\nonly a few minutes, and that hunk of stuff has been out for nobody knows\r\nhow many million years. It didn't get much heat from the sun except\r\nat perihelion, you know, so it's probably somewhere around minus two\r\nhundred and sixty degrees now. I'll have to throw a heater on it for\r\nhalf an hour before we can touch it. And since this is more or less new\r\nstuff to you, I'll caution you--don't try to touch anything that has\r\njust come in. That hammer or pike would freeze your hand instantly, even\r\nthough they've been out only a little while. Before you touch anything,\r\nblow on it, like this, see? If your breath freezes solid on it, like\r\nthat, don't touch it--it's cold.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnder the infra-beams of the heater, the mass of the metal was brought\r\nto room temperature and Stevens attacked it with his machine tools.\r\nBit by bit the stubborn material was torn from the lump. Through heavy\r\ngoggles he watched the incandescent mass in a refractory crucible, in\r\nthe heart of the induction furnace.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think you've got--what you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It wasn't iron--it wouldn't hold a magnet. It's royal\r\nmetal of some kind, I think. Base metals mostly melt at around fifteen\r\nhundred, and that crucible is still dry as a bone at better than\r\nseventeen.\"\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to separate out the tantalum and the others you want\r\nfrom the ones that you don't want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid that I'm not going to, very well,\" replied Stevens, with a\r\nwry grimace. \"What I don't know about metallurgy would fill a library,\r\nand I'm probably the world's worst chemist. However, by a series of\r\nsuccessive liquations, I hope to separate out fractions that I can\r\nuse. Platinum melts somewhere around seventeen-fifty, tantalum about\r\ntwenty-nine hundred, and tungsten not until 'way up around thirty-three,\r\nor four hundred--and that, by the way, means lots of grief. Of course,\r\neach fraction will probably be an alloy of one kind or another, but\r\nI think maybe I'll be able to make them do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But mayn't that whole chunk be a pure metal?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's conceivable, but not probable. There, she's beginning to separate\r\nat just below eighteen hundred! Platinum group coming out now, I\r\nthink--platinum, rhodium, iridium, and that gang, you know. While I'm\r\ndoing this, you might be getting those five coils into exact resonance,\r\nif you want to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I want to,\" and Nadia made her way across to the short-wave\r\noscillator and set to work.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so, bent over her delicate task, she began to twitch\r\nuneasily, then shrugged her shoulders impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"What's the idea of staring at me so?\" she broke out suddenly. \"How do\r\nyou expect me to tune these things up if you....\" She stopped abruptly,\r\nmouth open in amazement, as she turned toward Stevens. He had not been\r\nlooking at her, but he turned a surprised face from his own task at the\r\nsound of her voice. \"Excuse me, please, Steve. I don't know what's the\r\nmatter with me--must be getting jumpy, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish that was all, but it isn't!\" Face suddenly grim and hard,\r\nStevens leaped to the communicator plate and shot the beam out into\r\nspace. \"There's an answer, but that isn't it. You're a fine-tuned\r\ninstrument yourself, ace, and you've detected something.... I thought\r\nso! There's the answer--the guy that was looking at you!\"\r\n\r\nPlainly there was revealed upon the plate a small, spherical space-ship,\r\nvery like the one that had attacked and destroyed the _Arcturus_. After\r\nNadia had taken one glance at it, Stevens shut off the power and leaped\r\nout into the shop. He closed all the bulkhead doors and air-break\r\nopenings, then closed and secured the massive insulating door of the\r\nlifeboat in which they had made their headquarters. Then, after they\r\nhad again put on the space-suits they had taken off such a short time\r\nbefore, he extinguished all the lights and hooded the communicator\r\nscreen before he ventured again to glance out into the void.\r\n\r\n\"If I had a brain in my head, instead of the pint of bean soup I've got\r\nup there, we'd have worn these when they cut up the _Arcturus_, and\r\nsaved us a lot of mental wear and tear,\" he remarked. \"They were right\r\nthere in the lockers all the time, and I knew it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we got away, anyway. You couldn't be expected to think of\r\neverything at once. We didn't have much time, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I should have thought of anything as obvious as that, anyway.\r\nWonder how they found us? Did they detect us, or did they come out\r\nto this comet after metal, same as we did, and find us accidentally?\r\nHowever, it all works out the same--they're apparently out to get us.\r\nI'm afraid this is going to be a whole lot like a rabbit fighting back\r\nat a man with a gun; but we'll sure try to nibble us off a lunch while\r\nthey're getting a square meal ... here they come!\"\r\n\r\nThe enemy sphere launched its flaming plane of force, and the _Forlorn\r\nHope_ shuddered in every plate and member as its apex was severed\r\ncleanly under the impact. Instantly Stevens hurled his only weapons.\r\nFlaming ultra-violet and dully glowing infra-red, the twin beams lashed\r\nout; but their utmost force was of slight moment to the enormous power\r\ndriving the enemy screens. Two circular spots of cherry red in space\r\nwere the only results of Stevens' attack, and the next fierce cut\r\nsheared away the two projectors and, incidentally, a full half of the\r\nfifty-inch armor of the leading edge.\r\n\r\n\"Then we're checking out now?\" Nadia asked quietly, as the man's hands\r\ndropped from his useless controls. \"I'm sorrier than I can say, lover.\r\nBut at least, I'm glad that I can go out with you,\" and her glorious\r\neyes were shining with unshed tears.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe, but snap out of it, girl--our hearts are still beating! We're\r\nnot dead yet, and maybe we won't be. Perhaps they want to capture us\r\nalive, as they did before; if so, we may be able to hide out on them\r\nsomewhere and pull off another escape. Things don't look very bright, I\r\nknow, but we're not checking out until our numbers are actually run up!\"\r\n\r\nHe hooked a hand under her belt as the shocks came closer, and stood\r\ntense and ready. The lancing plane cut through one end of their control\r\nroom, and Stevens leaped with his companion toward the new-made opening;\r\nwhile the air shrieked outward into space and their suits bulged\r\nsuddenly with the abrupt increase in pressure differential. While they\r\nwere in midflight, the frightful blade of destruction cleaved its way\r\nthrough the control board and through the spot upon which they had been\r\nstanding a moment before. As they passed the severed edge, en route into\r\nopen spare, Stevens seized a metal brace and clung there, every nerve\r\ntaut.\r\n\r\n\"Something funny here, Nadia,\" he said after a little, in a low tone.\r\n\"They should have made one more cut, to make us absolutely blind and\r\nhelpless. As it is, they've clipped off all our projectors, so we can't\r\nmove, but I think we've got the whole control compartment of number two\r\nlifeboat untouched. If so, we can look around, anyway. Let's go!\"\r\n\r\nFloating without effort from fragment to fragment, they made their way\r\ntoward the section of their cruiser as yet undamaged. They found an\r\nairlock in working order, and were soon in the second lifeboat, where\r\nStevens hastily turned on a communicator and peered out into space.\r\n\r\n\"There they are! There's another stranger out there, too. They're\r\nfighting with her, now--that's probably why they didn't polish us off.\"\r\nSteel-braced, clumsy helmets touching, the two Terrestrials stared\r\nspell-bound into the plate; watching while the insensately vicious\r\nintelligences within the sphere brought its every force to bear upon\r\nanother and larger sphere which was now so close as to be plainly\r\nvisible. Like a gigantic drop of quicksilver this second globe\r\nappeared--its smooth and highly-polished surface one enormous, perfect,\r\nspherical mirror. Watching tensely, they saw flash out that frightful\r\nplane of seething energy, with the effects of which they were all too\r\nfamiliar, and saw it strike full upon the dazzling ball.\r\n\r\n\"This is awful, ace!\" Stevens groaned. \"They haven't got ray-screens,\r\neither, and without them they don't stand a chance. No possible\r\nsubstance can stand up under that beam. When they get done and turn back\r\nto us, we'll have to dive back to where we were.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut that brilliant mirror was not as vulnerable as Stevens had supposed.\r\nThe plane of force struck and clung, but could not penetrate it. Broken\r\nup into myriads of scintillating crystals of light, intersecting,\r\nmulti-colored rays, and cascading flares of sparkling energy, the beam\r\nwas reflected, thrown back, hurled away on all sides into space in\r\ncoruscating, blinding torrents. And neither was the monster globe\r\ninoffensive. The straining watchers saw a port open suddenly, emit a\r\nflame-erupting something, and close as rapidly as it had opened. That\r\nsomething was a projectile, its propelling rockets fiercely aflame; as\r\nsmoothly brilliant as its mother-ship and seemingly as impervious to the\r\nlethal beams of the common foe. Detected almost instantly as it was, it\r\nreceived the full power of the savage attack. The hitherto irresistible\r\nplane of force beat upon it; ultra-violet, infra-red, and heat rays\r\nenveloped it; there were hurled against it all the forces known to the\r\nscientific minds within that fiendishly destructive sphere.\r\n\r\nFinally, only a scant few hundreds of yards from its goal, the\r\nprotective mirror was punctured and the freight of high explosive let\r\ngo, with a silent, but nevertheless terrific, detonation. But now\r\nanother torpedo was on its way, and another, and another; boring on\r\nruthlessly toward the smaller sphere. Fighting simultaneously three\r\ntorpedos and the giant globe, the enemy began dodging, darting hither\r\nand thither with a stupendous acceleration; but the tiny pursuers could\r\nnot be shaken off. At every dodge and turn, steering rockets burst into\r\nfurious activity and the projectiles rushed ever nearer. Knowing that\r\nshe had at last encountered a superior force, the sphere turned in\r\nmad flight; but, prodigious as was her acceleration, the torpedoes\r\nwere faster and all three of them struck her at once. There ensued\r\nan explosion veritably space-racking in its intensity; a flash of\r\nincandescent brilliance that seemed to fill all space, subsiding into\r\na vast volume of tenuous gas which, feebly glowing, flowed about and\r\nattached itself to Cantrell's Comet. And in the space where had been\r\nthe enemy sphere, there was nothing.\r\n\r\nA slow-creeping pale blue rod of tangible force reached out from the\r\ngreat sphere, touched the wreckage of the _Forlorn Hope_, and pulled;\r\ngently, but with enormous power.\r\n\r\n\"Tractor beams again!\" exclaimed Stevens, still at the plate.\r\n\"Everybody's got 'em but us, it seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we can't fight a bit any more, can we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance--bows and arrows wouldn't do us much good. However, we may\r\nnot need 'em. Since they fought that other crew, and haven't blown us\r\nup, they aren't active enemies of ours, and may be friendly. I haven't\r\nany idea who or what they are, since even our communicator ray can't get\r\nthrough that mirror, but it looks as though our best bet is to act\r\npeaceable and see if we can't talk to them in some way. Right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right.\" They stepped out into the airlock, from which they saw that\r\nthe great sphere had halted only a few yards from them, and that an\r\nindistinct figure stood in an open door, waving to them an unmistakable\r\ninvitation to enter the strange vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we, Steve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Might as well. They've got us foul, and can take us if they want us.\r\nAnyway, we'll need at least a week to fix us up any kind of driving\r\npower, so we can't run--and we probably couldn't get away from those\r\nfolks if we had all our power. They haven't blown us up, and they could\r\nhave done it easily enough. Besides, they act friendly, so we'd better\r\nmeet them half way. Dive!\"\r\n\r\nFloating toward the open doorway, they were met by another rod of force,\r\nbrought gently into the airlock, and supported upright beside the being\r\nwho had invited them to visit him. Apparently an empty space-suit stood\r\nthere; a peculiarly-fitted suit of some partially transparent, flexible,\r\nglass-like material; towering fully a foot over the head of the tall\r\nTerrestrial. Closer inspection, however, revealed that there was\r\nsomething inside that suit--a shadowy, weirdly-transparent being,\r\nstaring at them with large, black eyes. The door clanged shut behind\r\nthem; they heard the faint hiss of inrushing air, and the inner door\r\nopened; but their enveloping suits remained stretched almost as tightly\r\nas ever. They felt the floor lurch beneath their feet, and a little\r\nweight was granted them as the space-ship got under way. Stevens waved\r\nhis arms vigorously at the stranger, pointing backward toward where he\r\nsupposed their own craft to be. The latter waved an arm reassuringly,\r\npressed a contact, and a section of the wall suddenly became\r\ntransparent. Through it Stevens saw with satisfaction that the _Forlorn\r\nHope_ was not being abandoned; in the grip of powerful tractor beams,\r\nevery fragment of the wreckage was following close behind them in their\r\nflight through space.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStevens and Nadia followed their guide along a corridor, through several\r\ndoors, and into a large room, which at first glance seemed empty, but\r\nin which several of the peculiarly transparent people of the craft were\r\nlying about upon cushions. They were undoubtedly human--but what humans!\r\nTall and reedy they were, with enormous barrel chests, topped by heads\r\nwhich, though really large, appeared insignificant because of the\r\nprodigious chests and because of the huge, sail-like, flapping ears.\r\nTheir skins were a strikingly, livid, pale blue, absolutely devoid of\r\nhair; and their lidless eyes, without a sign of iris, were chillingly\r\nhorrible in their stark contrast of enormous, glaring black pupil and\r\nghastly, transparent blue eyeball.\r\n\r\nAs the two Terrestrials entered the room, the beings struggled to their\r\nfeet and hurried laboriously away. Soon one of them returned, dressed in\r\nan insulating suit, and carrying three sets of head harnesses, connected\r\nby multiplex cables to a large box which he placed upon the floor.\r\nHe handed the headsets to the first officer, who in turn placed two of\r\nthem at the feet of the Terrestrials, indicating to them that they were\r\nto follow his example in placing them upon their heads, outside the\r\nhelmets. They did so, and even through the almost perfect insulation,\r\nand in spite of the powerful heaters of their suits, they felt a touch\r\nof frightful cold. The stranger turned a dial, and the two wanderers\r\nfrom Earth were instantly in full mental communication with Barkovis,\r\nthe commander of a space-ship of Titan, the sixth satellite of Saturn!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be ... say, what is this, anyway?\" Steve exclaimed\r\ninvoluntarily, and Nadia smiled as Barkovis answered with a thought,\r\nclearer than any spoken words.\r\n\r\n\"It is a thought-exchanger. I do not know its fundamental mechanism,\r\nsince we did not invent it and since I have had little time to study\r\nit. The apparatus, practically as you see it here, was discovered but a\r\nshort time ago, in a small, rocket-propelled space-ship which we found\r\nsome distance outside of the orbit of Jupiter. Its source of power had\r\nbeen destroyed by the cold of outer space, but re-powering it was, of\r\ncourse, a small matter. The crew of the vessel were all dead. They\r\nwere, however, of human stock, and of a type adapted for life upon\r\na satellite. I deduce, from your compact structure, your enormous\r\natmospheric pressure, and your, to us, unbelievably high body\r\ntemperature, that you must be planet-dwellers. I suppose that you\r\nare natives of Jupiter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite.\" Stevens had in a measure recovered from his stunned\r\nsurprise. \"We are from Tellus, the third planet,\" and he revealed\r\nrapidly the events leading up to their present situation, concluding:\r\n\"The people in the other sphere were, we believe, natives of Jupiter or\r\nof one of the satellites. We know nothing of them, since we could not\r\nlook through their screens. You rescued us from them; do you not know\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Our visirays also were stopped by their screens of force--screens\r\nentirely foreign to our science. This is the first time that any\r\nvessel from our Saturnian system has ever succeeded in reaching the\r\nneighborhood of Jupiter. We came in peace, but they attacked us at sight\r\nand we were obliged to destroy them. Now we must hurry back to Titan,\r\nfor two reasons. First, because we are already at the extreme limit\r\nof our power range and Jupiter is getting further and further away\r\nfrom Saturn. Second because our mirrors, which we had thought perfect\r\nreflectors of all frequencies possible of generation, are not perfect.\r\nEnough of those forces came through the mirrors to volatilize half our\r\ncrew, and in a few minutes more none of us would have been left alive.\r\nWhy, in some places our very atmosphere became almost hot enough to melt\r\nwater! If another of those vessels should attack us, in all probability\r\nwe should all be lost. Therefore we are leaving as rapidly as is\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are taking the pieces of our ship along--we do not want to encumber\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no encumbrance, since we have ample supplies of power. In fact,\r\nwe are now employing the highest acceleration we Titanians can endure\r\nfor any length of time.\"\r\n\r\nStevens pondered long, forgetting that his thoughts were plain as print\r\nto the Titanian commander. Thank Heaven these strangers had sense enough\r\nto be friendly--all intelligent races should be friends, for mutual\r\nadvancement. But it was a mighty long stretch to Saturn and this\r\nacceleration wasn't so much. How long would it take to get there? Could\r\nthey get back? Wouldn't they save time by casting themselves adrift,\r\nmaking the repairs most urgently needed, and going back to Ganymede\r\nunder their own power? But would they have enough power left in the\r\nwreck to get even that far? And how about the big tube? He was\r\ninterrupted by an insistent thought from Barkovis.\r\n\r\n\"You will save time, Stevens, by coming with us to Titan. There we shall\r\naid you in repairing your vessel and in completing your transmitting\r\ntube, in which we shall be deeply interested. Our power plants shall\r\nsupply you with energy for your return journey until you are close\r\nenough to Jupiter to recover your own beam. You are tired. I would\r\nsuggest that you rest--that you sleep long and peacefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be handling the _Forlorn Hope_ without any trouble--the\r\npieces aren't grinding at all. We'd better live there, hadn't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes that would be best, for all of us. You could not live a minute here\r\nwithout your suits; and, efficiently insulated as those suits are, yet\r\nyour incandescent body temperature makes our rooms unbearably hot--so\r\nhot that any of us must wear a space-suit while in the same room with\r\nyou, to avoid being burned to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"The incandescently hot\" Terrestrials were wafted into the open airlock\r\nof their lifeboat upon a wand of force, and soon had prepared a long\r\noverdue supper, over which Stevens cast his infectious, boyish grin at\r\nNadia.\r\n\r\n\"Sweetheart, you are undoubtedly a 'warm number,' and you have often\r\nremarked that I 'burn you up.' Nevertheless I think that we were both\r\nconsiderably surprised to discover that we are both hot enough actually\r\nto consume persons unfortunate enough to be confined in the same room\r\nwith us!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're funny, Steve--like a crutch,\" she rebuked him, but smiled back,\r\nan elusive dimple playing in one lovely brown cheek. \"Looking right\r\nthrough anybody is too ghastly for words, but I think they're perfectly\r\nall x, anyway, in spite of their being so hideous and so cold-blooded!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA Frigid Civilization\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Percival Van Schravendyck Stevens!\" Nadia strode purposely into\r\nStevens' room and seized him by the shoulder. \"Are you going to sleep\r\nall the way to Saturn? You answered me when I pounded on the partition\r\nwith a hammer, but I don't believe that you woke up at all. Get up,\r\nyou--breakfast will be all spoiled directly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\" Stevens opened one sluggish eye; then, as the full force of the\r\ninsult penetrated his consciousness, he came wide awake. \"Lay off those\r\nnames, ace, or you'll find yourself walking back home!\" he threatened.\r\n\r\n\"All x by me!\" she retorted. \"I might as well go home if you're going\r\nto sleep _all_ the time!\" and she widened her expressive eyes at him\r\nimpishly as she danced blithely back into the control room. As she went\r\nout she slammed his door with a resounding clang, and Stevens pried\r\nhimself out of his bunk one joint at a time, dressed, and made himself\r\npresentable.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh!\" he yawned mightily as he joined the girl at breakfast. \"I don't\r\nknow when I've had such a gorgeous sleep. How do you get by on so\r\nlittle?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't. I sleep a lot, but I do it every night, instead of working for\r\nfour days and nights on end and then trying to make up all those four\r\nnights' sleep at once. I'm going to break you of that, too, Steve, if\r\nit's the last thing I ever do.\"\r\n\r\n\"There might be certain advantages in it, at that,\" he conceded, \"but\r\nsometimes you've got to do work when it's got to be done, instead of\r\njust between sleeps. However, I'll try to do better. Certainly it is\r\na wonderful relief to get out of that mess, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say it is! But I wish that those folks were more like people.\r\nThey're nice, I think, really, but they're so ... so ... well, so\r\nghastly that it simply gives me the blue shivers just to look at one\r\nof them!\"\r\n\r\n\"They're pretty gruesome, no fooling,\" he agreed, \"but you get used to\r\nthings like that. I just about threw a fit the first time I ever saw\r\na Martian, and the Venerians are even worse in some ways--they're so\r\nclammy and dead-looking--but now I've got real friends on both planets.\r\nOne thing, though, gives me the pip. I read a story a while ago--the\r\nlatest best-seller thing of Thornton's named 'Interstellar Slush' or\r\nsome such tr....\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleophora--An Interstellar Romance,\" she corrected him. \"I thought it\r\nwas wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't. It's fundamentally unsound. Look at our nearest neighbors,\r\nwho probably came from the same original stock we did. A Tellurian\r\ncan admire, respect, or like a Venerian, yes. But for _loving_ one of\r\nthem--wow! Beauty is purely relative, you know. For instance, I think\r\nthat you are the most perfectly beautiful thing I ever saw; but no\r\nVenerian would think so. Far from it. Any Martian that hadn't seen many\r\nof us would have to go rest his eyes after taking one good look at\r\nyou. Considering what love means, it doesn't stand to reason that any\r\nTellurian woman could possibly fall in love with any man not of her own\r\nbreed. Any writer is wrong who indulges in interplanetary love affairs\r\nand mad passions. They simply don't exist. They _can't_ exist--they're\r\nagainst all human instincts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interplanetary--in this solar system--yes. But the Dacrovos were just\r\nlike us, only nicer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what gives me the pip. If our own cousins of the same solar\r\nsystem are so repulsive to us, how would we be affected by entirely\r\nalien forms of intelligence?\"\r\n\r\n\"May be you're right, of course--but you may be wrong, too,\" she\r\ninsisted. \"The Universe is big enough, so that people like the Dacrovos\r\nmay possibly exist in it somewhere. May be the Big Three will discover a\r\nmeans of interstellar travel--then I'll get to see them myself, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and _if_ we do, and _if_ you ever see any such people, I'll bet\r\nthat the sight of them will make your hair curl right up into a ball,\r\ntoo! But about Barkovis--remember how diplomatic the thoughts were that\r\nhe sent us? He described our structure as being 'compact,' but I got the\r\nundertone of his real thoughts, as well. Didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, now that you mention it, I did. He really thought that we were\r\nwhite-hot, under-sized, overpowered, warty, hairy, hideously opaque and\r\ngenerally repulsive little monstrosities--thoroughly unpleasant and\r\ndistasteful. But he was friendly, just the same. Heavens, Steve! Do you\r\nsuppose that he read our real thoughts, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure he did; but he is intelligent enough to make allowances, the same\r\nas we are doing. He isn't any more insulted than we are. He knows that\r\nsuch feelings are ingrained and cannot be changed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, they experienced a new sensation. For the first time in\r\nmonths they had nothing to do! Used as they were to being surrounded by\r\npressing tasks, they enjoyed their holiday immensely for a few hours.\r\nSitting idly at the communicator plate, they scanned the sparkling\r\nheavens with keen interest. Beneath them Jupiter was a brilliant\r\ncrescent not far from the sun in appearance, which latter had already\r\ngrown perceptibly smaller and less bright. Above them, and to their\r\nright, Saturn shone refulgently, his spectacular rings plainly visible.\r\nAll about them were the glories of the firmament, which never fail to\r\nawe the most seasoned observer. But idleness soon became irksome to\r\nthose two active spirits, and Stevens prowled restlessly about their\r\nnarrow quarters.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to go to work before I go dippy,\" he soon declared. \"They've\r\ngot lots of power, and we can rig up a transmitter unit to send it over\r\nhere to our receptor. Then I can start welding the old _Hope_ together\r\nwithout waiting until we get to Titan to start it. Think I'll signal\r\nBarkovis to come over, and see what he thinks about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Titanian commander approved the idea, and the transmitting field was\r\nquickly installed. Nadia insisted that she, too, needed to work, and\r\nthat she was altogether too good a mechanic to waste; therefore the two\r\nagain labored mightily together, day after day. But the girl limited\r\nrigidly their hours of work to those of the working day; and evening\r\nafter evening Barkovis visited with them for hours. Dressed in his heavy\r\nspace-suit and supported by a tractor beam well out of range of what\r\nseemed to him terrific heat radiated by the bodies of the Terrestrials,\r\nhe floated along unconcernedly; while over the multiplex cable of the\r\nthought-exchanger he conversed with the man and woman seated just inside\r\nthe open outer door of their air-lock. The Titanian's appetite for\r\ninformation was insatiable--particularly did he relish everything\r\npertaining to the earth and to the other inner planets, forever barred\r\nto him and to his kind. In return Stevens and Nadia came gradually to\r\nknow the story of the humanity of Titan.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad beyond measure to have known you,\" Barkovis mused, one night.\r\n\"Your existence proves that there is truth in mythology, as some of\r\nus have always believed. Your visit to Titan will create a furor in\r\nscientific circles, for you are impossibility incarnate--personifications\r\nof the preposterous. In you, wildest fancy had become commonplace.\r\nAccording to many of our scientists, it is utterly impossible for you\r\nto exist. Yet you say, and it must be, that there are millions upon\r\nmillions of similar beings. Think of it! Venerians, Tellurians,\r\nMartians, the satellite dwellers of the lost space-ship, and us--so\r\nsimilar mentally, yet physically how different!\"\r\n\r\n\"But where does the mythology come in?\" thought Nadia.\r\n\r\n\"We have unthinkably ancient legends which say that once Titan was\r\nextremely hot, and that our remote ancestors were beings of fire, in\r\nwhose veins ran molten water instead of blood. Since our recorded\r\nhistory goes back some tens of thousands of Saturnian years, and since\r\nin that long period there has been no measurable change in us, few\r\nof us have believed in the legends at all. They have been thought the\r\nsurviving figments of a barbarous, prehistoric worship of the sun.\r\nHowever, such a condition is not in conflict with the known facts of\r\ncosmogony, and since there actually exists such a humanity as yours--a\r\nhumanity whose bodily tissues actually _are_ composed largely of molten\r\nwater--those ancient legends must indeed have been based upon truth.\r\n\r\n\"What an evolution! Century after century of slowly decreasing\r\ntemperature--one continuous struggle to adapt the physique to a\r\nconstantly changing environment. First they must have tried to maintain\r\ntheir high temperature by covering and heating their cities.--Then,\r\nas vegetation died, they must have bred into their plants the ability\r\nto use as sap purely chemical liquids, such as our present natural\r\nfluids--which also may have been partly synthetic then--instead of the\r\nmolten water to which they had been accustomed. They must have modified\r\nsimilarly the outer atmosphere; must have made it more reactive, to\r\ncompensate for the lowered temperature at which metabolism must take\r\nplace. As Titan grew colder and colder they probably dug their cities\r\ndeeper and ever deeper; until humanity came finally to realize that it\r\nmust itself change completely or perish utterly.\r\n\r\n\"Then we may picture them as aiding evolution in changing their body\r\nchemistry. For thousands, and thousands of years there must have gone\r\non the gradual adaptation of blood stream and tissue to more and more\r\nvolatile liquids, and to lower and still lower temperatures. This must\r\nhave continued until Titan arrived at the condition which has now\r\nobtained for ages--a condition of thermal equilibrium with space upon\r\none hand and upon the other the sun, which changes appreciably only in\r\nmillions upon millions of years. In equilibrium at last--with our bodily\r\nand atmospheric temperatures finally constant at their present values,\r\nwhich seem as low to you as yours appear high to us. Truly, an evolution\r\nastounding to contemplate!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about power?\" asked Stevens. \"You seem to have all you want,\r\nand yet it doesn't stand to reason that there could be very much\r\ngenerated upon a satellite so old and so cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right. For ages there has been but little power produced\r\nupon Titan. Many cycles ago, however, our scientists had developed\r\nrocket-driven space-ships, with which they explored our neighboring\r\nsatellites, and even Saturn itself. It is from power plants upon Saturn\r\nthat we draw energy. Their construction was difficult in the extreme,\r\nsince the pioneers had to work in braces because of the enormous force\r\nof gravity. Then, too, they had to be protected from the overwhelming\r\npressure and poisonous qualities of the air, and insulated from a\r\ntemperature far above the melting point of water. In such awful heat,\r\nof course, our customary building material, water, could not be\r\nemployed....\"\r\n\r\n\"But all our instruments have indicated that Saturn is _cold_!\" Stevens\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Its surface temperature, as read from afar, would be low,\" conceded\r\nBarkovis, \"but the actual surface of the planet is extremely hot, and\r\nis highly volcanic. Practically none of its heat is radiated because of\r\nthe great density and depth of its atmosphere, which extends for many\r\nhundreds of your kilometers. It required many thousands of lives and\r\nmany years of time to build and install those automatic power plants,\r\nbut once they were in operation, we were assured of power for many tens\r\nof thousands of years to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our system of power transmission is more or less like yours, but we\r\nhaven't anything like your range. Suppose you'd be willing to teach me\r\nthe computation of your fields?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we shall be glad to give you the formulae. Being an older race, it\r\nis perhaps natural that we should have developed certain refinements as\r\nyet unknown to you. But I am, I perceived, detaining you from your time\r\nof rest--goodbye,\" and Barkovis was wafted back toward his mirrored\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of this chemical solution blood of theirs, Steve?\"\r\nasked Nadia, watching the placidly floating form of the Titanian\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"Not much. I may have mentioned before that there are one or two, or\r\nperhaps even three men who are better chemists than I am. I gathered\r\nthat it is something like a polyhydric alcohol and something like a\r\nsubstituted hydrocarbon, and yet different from either in that it\r\ncontains flourin in loose combination. I think it is something that our\r\nTellurian chemists haven't got yet; but they've got so many organic\r\ncompounds now that they may have synthesized it, at that. You see,\r\nTitan's atmosphere isn't nearly as dense as ours, but what there is\r\nof it is pure dynamite. Ours is a little oxygen, mixed with a lot of\r\ninert ingredients. Theirs is oxygen, heavily laced with flourin. It's\r\n_reactive_, no fooling! However, something pretty violent must be\r\nnecessary to carry on body reactions at such a temperature as theirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably; but I know even less about that kind of thing than you do.\r\nFunny, isn't it, the way he thinks 'water' when he means ice, and always\r\nthinks of our real water as being molten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Reasonable enough when you think about it. Temperature differences are\r\nlogarithmic, you know, not arithmetic--the effective difference between\r\nhis body temperature and ours is perhaps even greater than that between\r\nours and that of melted iron. We never think of iron as being a liquid,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, too. Well, good night, Steve dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Bye, little queen of space--see you at breakfast,\" and the _Forlorn\r\nHope_ became dark and silent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDay after day the brilliant sphere flew toward distant Saturn, with the\r\nwreckage of the _Forlorn Hope_ in tow. Piece by piece that wreckage was\r\nbrought together and held in place by the Titanian tractors; and slowly\r\nbut steadily, under Stevens' terrific welding projector, the stubborn\r\nsteel flowed together, once more to become a seamless, spaceworthy\r\nstructure. And Nadia, the electrician, followed close behind the welder.\r\nWielding torch, pliers and spanner with practised hand, she repaired or\r\ncut out of circuit the damaged accumulator cells and reunited the ends\r\nof each severed power lead. Understanding Nadia's work thoroughly, the\r\nTitanians were not particularly interested in it; but whenever Stevens\r\nmade his way along an outside seam, he had a large and thrillingly\r\nhorrified gallery. Everyone who could possibly secure permission to\r\nleave the sphere did so, each upon his own pencil of force, and went\r\nover to watch the welder. They did not come close to him--to venture\r\nwithin fifty feet of that slow moving spot of scintillating brilliance,\r\neven in a space-suit, meant death--but, poised around him in space, they\r\nwatched with shuddering, incredulous amazement, the monstrous human\r\nbeing in whose veins ran molten water instead of blood; whose body was\r\nalready so fiercely hot that it could exist unharmed while working\r\npractically without protection, upon _liquefied_ metal!\r\n\r\nFinally the welding was done. The insulating space was evacuated and\r\nheld its vacuum--outer and inner shells were bottle-tight. The two\r\nmechanics heaved deep sighs of relief as they discarded their cumbersome\r\narmor and began to repair what few of their machine tools had been\r\ndamaged by the slashing plane of force which had so neatly sliced the\r\n_Forlorn Hope_ into sections.\r\n\r\n\"Say, big fellow, you're the guy that slings the ink, ain't you?\" Nadia\r\nextinguished her torch and swaggered up to Stevens, hands on hips, her\r\nwalk an exaggerated roll. \"Write me out a long walk. This job's all\r\nplayed out, so I think I'll get me a good job on Titan. I said give me\r\nmy time, you big stiff!\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't say nothing!\" growled Stevens in his deepest bass, playing\r\nup to her lead as he always did. \"Bounce back, cub, you've struck a\r\nrubber fence! You signed on for duration and you'll stick--see?\"\r\n\r\nArm in arm they went over to the nearest communicator plate. Flipping\r\nthe switch, Stevens turned the dial and Titan shone upon the screen; so\r\nclose, that it no longer resembled a moon, but was a world toward which\r\nthey were falling with an immense velocity.\r\n\r\n\"Not close enough to make out much detail yet--let's take another\r\nlook at Saturn,\" and Stevens projected the visiray beam out toward the\r\nmighty planet. It was now an enormous full moon, almost five degrees in\r\napparent diameter,[1] its visible surface an expanse of what they knew\r\nto be billowing cloud, shining brilliantly white in the pale sunlight,\r\nbroken only by a dark equatorial band.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The moon subtends an angle of about one-half of a degree.]\r\n\r\n\"Those rings were _such_ a gorgeous spectacle a little while ago!\" Nadia\r\nmourned. \"It's a shame that Titan has to be right in their plane, isn't\r\nit? Think of living this close to one of the most wonderful sights in\r\nthe Solar System, and never being able to see it. Think they know what\r\nthey're missing, Steve?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to ask Barkovis,\" Stevens replied. He swung the communicator\r\nbeam back toward Titan, and Nadia shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's hideous!\" she exclaimed. \"I thought that it would improve as\r\nwe got closer, but the plainer we can see it, the worse it gets. Just to\r\nthink of human beings, even such cold-blooded ones as those over there,\r\nliving upon such a horrible moon and _liking_ it, gives me the blue\r\nshivers!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's pretty bleak, no fooling,\" he admitted, and peered through the\r\neyepiece of the visiray telescope, studying minutely the forbidding\r\nsurface of the satellite they were so rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\nLarger and larger it loomed, a cratered, jagged globe of desolation\r\nindescribable; of sheer, bitter cold incarnate and palpable; of stark,\r\nsharp contrasts. Gigantic craters, in whose yawning depths no spark of\r\nwarmth had been generated for countless cycles of time, were surrounded\r\nby vast plains eroded to the dead level of a windless sea. Every lofty\r\nobject cast a sharply outlined shade of impenetrable blackness, beside\r\nwhich the weak light of the sun became a dazzling glare. The ground was\r\neither a brilliant white or an intense black, unrelieved by half-tones.\r\n\r\n\"I can't hand it much, either, Nadia, but it's all in the way you've\r\nbeen brought up, you know. This is home to them, and just to look at\r\nTellus would give them the pip. Ha! Here's something you'll like, even\r\nif it does look so cold that it makes me feel like hugging a couple of\r\nheater coils. It's Barkovis' city the one we're heading for, I think.\r\nIt's close enough now so that we can get it on the plate,\" and he set\r\nthe communicator beam upon the metropolis of Titan.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't see a thing, Steve--where and what is it?\" They were\r\ndropping vertically downward toward the center of a vast plain of white,\r\nfeatureless and desolate; and Nadia stared in disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"You'll see directly--it's too good to spoil by telling you what to look\r\nfor or wh....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there it is!\" she cried. \"It _is_ beautiful, Steve, but how\r\nfrightfully, utterly cold!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA flash of prismatic color had caught the girl's eye, and, one\r\ntransparent structure thus revealed to her sight, there had burst into\r\nview a city of crystal. Low buildings of hexagonal shape, arranged\r\nin irregularly variant hexagonal patterns, extended mile upon mile.\r\nFrom the roofs of the structures lacy spires soared heavenward;\r\ninter-connected by long, slim cantilever bridges whose prodigious\r\nspans seemed out of all proportion to the gossamer delicacy of their\r\nconstruction. Buildings, spires, and bridges formed fantastic\r\ngeometrical designs, at which Nadia exclaimed in delight.\r\n\r\n\"I've just thought of what that reminds me of--it's snowflakes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--I knew it was something familiar. Snowflakes--no two are ever\r\nexactly alike, and yet every one is symmetrical and hexagonal. We're\r\ngoing to land on the public square--see the crowds? Let's put on our\r\nsuits and go out.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Forlorn Hope_ lay in a hexagonal park, and near it the Titanian\r\nglobe had also come to rest. All about the little plot towered the\r\nglittering buildings of crystal, and in its center played a fountain;\r\na series of clear and sparkling cascades of liquid jewels. Under foot\r\nthere spread a thick, soft carpet of whitely brilliant vegetation.\r\nThrongs of the grotesque citizens of Titania were massed to greet the\r\nspace-ships; throngs clustering close about the globular vessel, but\r\nmaintaining a respectful distance from the fiercely radiant Terrestrial\r\nwedge. All were shouting greetings and congratulations--shouts which\r\nStevens found as intelligible as his own native tongue.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I can understand every word they say, Steve!\" Nadia exclaimed, in\r\nsurprise. \"How come, do you suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can, too. Don't know--must be from using that thought telephone of\r\ntheirs so much, I guess. Here comes Barkovis--I'll ask him.\"\r\n\r\nThe Titanian commander had been in earnest conversation with a group of\r\nfellow-creatures and was now walking toward the Terrestrials, carrying\r\nthe multiple headsets. Placing them upon the white sward, he backed\r\naway, motioning the two visitors to pick them up.\r\n\r\n\"It may not be necessary, Barkovis,\" Stevens said, slowly and clearly.\r\n\"We do not know why, but we can understand what your people are saying,\r\nand it may be that you can now understand us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I can understand your English perfectly. A surprising\r\ndevelopment, but perhaps, after all, one that should have been expected,\r\nfrom the very nature of the device we have been using. I wanted to tell\r\nyou that I have just received grave news, which makes it impossible for\r\nus to help you immediately, as I promised. While we were gone, one of\r\nour two power-plants upon Saturn failed. In consequence, Titan's power\r\nhas been cut to a minimum, since maintaining our beam at that great\r\ndistance required a large fraction of the output of the other plant.\r\nBecause of this lack, the Sedlor walls were weakened to such a point\r\nthat in spite of the Guardian's assurances, I think trouble is\r\ninevitable. At all events, it is of the utmost importance that we begin\r\nrepairing the damaged unit, for that is to be a task indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it will take time,\" agreed Stevens, remembering what the\r\nTitanian captain had told him concerning the construction of those\r\nplants--generators which had been in continuous and automatic operation\r\nfor thousands of Saturnian years.\r\n\r\n\"It will take more than time--it will take lives,\" replied Barkovis,\r\ngravely. \"Scores, perhaps hundreds, of us will never again breathe the\r\nclear, pure air of Titan. In spite of all precaution and all possible\r\nbracing and insulation, man after man after man will be crushed by\r\nhis own weight, volatilized by the awful heat, poisoned by the foul\r\natmosphere, or will burst into unthinkable flames at the touch of some\r\nflying spark from the inconceivably hot metals with which we shall have\r\nto work. A horrible fate, but we shall not lack for volunteers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure not; and of course you yourself would go. And I never thought of\r\nthe effect a spark would have on you--your tissues would probably be\r\nwildly inflammable. But say, I just had a thought. Just how hot is the\r\nair at those plants and just what is the actual pressure?\"\r\n\r\n\"According to the records, the temperature is some forty of your\r\ncentigrade degrees above the melting-point of water, and the pressure\r\nis not far short of two of your meters of mercury. I find it almost\r\nimpossible to think of mercury as a liquid, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"You find it impossible, since you use it as a metal, for wires in coils\r\nand so on. But plus forty, while pretty warm, isn't impossible, by any\r\nmeans; and we could stand double our air pressure for quite a while.\r\nBoth my partner and I are pretty fair mechanics and we've got quite a\r\nline of machine tools, such as you could not possibly have here. We'll\r\ngive it a whirl, since we owe you something already. Lead us to it,\r\nace--but wait a minute! We can't see through the fog, so couldn't find\r\nthe plants, and probably your wiring diagrams would explode if I touched\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never thought of your helping us,\" mused Barkovis. \"The idea of any\r\nliving being existing in that inferno has always been unthinkable, but\r\nthe difficulties you mention are slight. We have already built in our\r\nvessel communicators similar to yours, and radio sets. With these we can\r\nguide you and explain the plants to you as you work, and our tractor\r\nbeams will be of assistance to you in moving heavy objects, even at such\r\ndistances from the surface as we Titanians shall have to maintain. If\r\nyou will set out a flask of your atmosphere, we will analyze it, for the\r\nthought has come to me that perhaps, being planet-dwellers yourselves,\r\nthe air of Saturn might not be as poisonous to you as it is to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a thought, too,\" and, the news broadcast, it was not long until\r\nthe two ships leaped into the air, to the accompaniment of the cheers\r\nand plaudits of a watching multitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a wide curve they sped toward Saturn. Passing so close to the\r\nenormous rings that the individual meteoric fragments could almost be\r\nseen with the unaided eye, they flashed on and on, slowing down long\r\nbefore they approached the upper surface of the envelope of cloud.\r\nThe spherical space-ship stopped and Stevens, staring into his useless\r\nscreen, drove the _Forlorn Hope_ downward mile after mile, solely under\r\nBarkovis' direction, changing course and power from time to time as the\r\nTitanian's voice came from the speaker at his elbow. Slower and slower\r\nbecame the descent, until finally, almost upon the broad, flat roof\r\nof the power-plant, Stevens saw it in his plate. Breathing deeply in\r\nrelief, he dropped quickly down upon a flat pavement, neutralized his\r\ncontrols, and turned to Nadia.\r\n\r\n\"Well, old golf-shootist, we're here at last--now we'll go out and see\r\nwhat's gone screwy with the works. Remember that gravity is about double\r\nnormal here, and conduct yourself accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's supposed to be only about nine-tenths,\" she objected.\r\n\r\n\"That's at the outer surface of the atmosphere,\" he replied. \"And it's\r\n_some_ atmosphere--not like the thin layer we've got on Tellus.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the airlock, and Stevens admitted air until their\r\nsuits began to collapse. Then, face-plate valves cracked, he sniffed\r\ncautiously, finally opening his helmet wide. Nadia followed suit and\r\nthe man laughed as she wrinkled her nose in disgust as two faint, but\r\nunmistakable odors smote her olfactory nerves.\r\n\r\n\"I never cared particularly for hydrogen sulphide and sulphur dioxide,\r\neither,\" he assured her, \"but they aren't strong enough to hurt us in\r\nthe short time we'll be here. Those Titanian chemists know their stuff,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the outer valves slowly, then opened the door and they stepped\r\ndown upon the smooth, solid floor, which Stevens examined carefully.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so, from his story. Solid platinum! This whole plant is\r\nbuilt of platinum, iridium, and noble alloys--the only substances known\r\nthat will literally last forever. Believe me, ace of my bosom, I don't\r\nwonder that it cost them lives to build it--with their conditions, I\r\ndon't see how they ever got it built at all.\"\r\n\r\nBefore them rose an immense, flat-topped cone of metal, upon the top of\r\nwhich was situated the power plant. Twelve massive pillars supported a\r\nflat roof, but permitted the air to circulate freely throughout the one\r\ngreat room which housed the machinery. They climbed a flight of stairs,\r\npassed between two pillars, and stared about them. There was no noise,\r\nno motion--there was nothing that _could_ move. Twelve enormous masses\r\nof metallic checkerwork, covered with wide cooling fins, almost filled\r\nthe vast hall. From the center of each mass great leads extended out\r\ninto a clear space in the middle of the room, there uniting in mid-air\r\nto form one enormous bus-bar. This bar, thicker than a man's body, had\r\noriginally curved upward to the base of an immense parabolic structure\r\nof latticed bars. Now, however, it was broken in midspan and the two\r\nends bent toward the floor. Above their heads, a jagged hole gaped in\r\nthe heavy metal of the roof, and a similar hole had been torn in the\r\nfloor. The bar had been broken and these holes had been made by some\r\nheavy body, probably a meteorite, falling with terrific velocity.\r\n\r\n\"This is it, all right,\" Stevens spoke to distant Barkovis. \"Sure\r\nthere's nothing on this beam? If it should be hot and I should short\r\ncircuit or bridge it with my body, it would be just too bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have made sure that nothing is connected to it,\" the Titanian\r\nassured him. \"Do you think you can do anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely. We've got jacks that'll bend heavier stuff than that, and\r\nafter we get it straightened the welding will be easy, but I'll have\r\nto have some metal. Shall I cut a piece off the pavement outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will not be necessary. You will find ample stores of spare metal\r\npiled at the base of each pillar.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x. Now we'll get the jack, Nadia,\" and they went back to their\r\nvessel, finding that upon Saturn, their combined strength was barely\r\nsufficient to drag the heavy tool along the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Stand aside, please. We will place it for you,\" a calm voice sounded in\r\ntheir ears, and a pale blue tractor beam picked the massive jack lightly\r\nfrom the floor, and as lightly lifted it to its place beneath the broken\r\nbus-bar and held it there while Stevens piled blocks and plates of\r\nplatinum beneath its base.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here's where I peel down as far as the law allows. This is going\r\nto be real work, girl--no fooling. It'd help a lot if this outfit were\r\nsending out a few thousand kilo-franks instead of standing idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"How would that help?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a heat-engine, you know--works by absorbing heat. The cold air\r\nsinks--I imagine it pretty nearly blows a gale down the side of this\r\ncone when it's working--and hot air rushes in to take its place. I could\r\nuse a little cool breeze right now,\" and Stevens, stripped to the waist,\r\nbent to the lever of the powerful hydraulic jack.\r\n\r\nBeads of sweat gathered upon his broad back, uniting to form tiny\r\nrivulets, and the girl became highly concerned about him.\r\n\r\n\"Let me help you, Steve--I'm pretty husky, too, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure you are, ace, but this is a job for a truck-horse, not a\r\ntenderly-nurtured maiden of the upper classes. You can help, though, by\r\nbreaking out that welding outfit and getting it ready while I'm doing\r\nthis bending to prepare for the welding.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the urge of that mighty jack the ends of the broken bus-bar rose\r\ninto place, while far off in space the Titanians clustered about their\r\nvisiray screens, watching, in almost unbelieving amazement, the\r\nsupernatural being who labored in that reeking inferno of heat and\r\npoisonous vapor--who labored almost naked and entirely unprotected,\r\nrefreshing himself from time to time with drafts of molten water!\r\n\r\n\"All x, Barkovis--that's high, I guess.\" Stevens flipped perspiration\r\nfrom his hot forehead with a wet finger and straightened his weary back.\r\n\"Now you can put this jack away where we had it. Then you might trundle\r\nme over enough of that spare metal to fill up this hole, and I'll put on\r\nmy suit and goggles and practice welding on this floor and the roof, to\r\nget the feel of the metal before I tackle the bar.\"\r\n\r\nThe hole in the floor was filled with scrap and soon sparks were flying\r\nwildly as the searing beam of Stevens' welding projector bit viciously\r\ninto the stubborn alloy of noble metals; fashioning a smooth, solid\r\nfloor where the yawning aperture had been. Then, lifted with his tools\r\nand plates to the roof, the man repaired that hole also.\r\n\r\n\"Now I know enough about it to do a good job on the bar,\" he decided,\r\nand brick after brick of alloy was fused into the crack, until only a\r\nsmoothly rounded bulge betrayed that a break had ever existed in that\r\nmighty rod of metal.\r\n\r\n\"Give 'em the signal to draw power, and see if that's all that was the\r\nmatter,\" Stevens instructed, as he relaxed in the grateful coolness of\r\ntheir control room. \"Whew, that was a warm job, Nadia--and this air of\r\nours does smell good!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It was a horrible job, and I'm glad it's done,\" she declared. \"But say,\r\nSteve, that thing looks as little like a power-plant as anything I can\r\nimagine. How does it work? You said that it worked on heat, but I don't\r\nquite see how. But don't draw diagrams and _please_ don't integrate!\"\r\n\r\n\"No ordinary plant such as we use could run for centuries\r\nwithout attention,\" he replied. \"This is a highly advanced\r\nheat-engine--something like a thermo-couple, you know. This whole thing\r\nis simply the hot end, connected to the cold end on Titan by a beam\r\ninstead of wires. When it's working, this metal must cool off something\r\nfierce. That's what the checkerwork and fins are for--so that it can\r\nabsorb the maximum amount of heat from the current of hot, moist air\r\nI spoke about. It's a sweet system--we'll have to rig up one between\r\nTellus and the moon. Or even between the Equator and the Arctic Circle\r\nthere'd be enough thermal differential to give us a million kilofranks.\r\nWe haven't got the all x signal yet, but it's working--look at it sweat\r\nas it cools down!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say it's sweating--the water is simply streaming off it!\" In their\r\nplate they saw that moisture was already beginning to condense upon the\r\nheat-absorber: moisture running down the fins in streams and creeping\r\nover the dull metal floor in sluggish sheets; moisture which, turning\r\ninto ice in the colder interior of the checkerwork, again became fluid\r\nat the inrush of hot, wet Saturnian air.\r\n\r\n\"There's the signal--all x, Barkovis? By the way it's condensing water,\r\nit seems to be functioning again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfect!\" came the Titanian's enthusiastic reply, \"You two\r\nplanet-dwellers have done more in three short hours than the entire\r\nforce of Titan could have accomplished in months. You have earned, and\r\nshall receive, the highest....\"\r\n\r\n\"As you were, ace!\" Stevens interrupted, embarrassed. \"This job was just\r\nlike shooting fish down a well, for us. Since you saved our lives, we\r\nowe you a lot yet. We're coming out--straight up!\"\r\n\r\nThe _Forlorn Hope_ shot upward, through mile after mile of steaming fog,\r\nuntil at last she broke through into the light, clear outer atmosphere.\r\nStevens located the Titanian space-ship, and the two vessels once more\r\nhurtling together through the ether toward Titan, he turned to his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Take the controls, will you, Nadia? Think I'll finish up the tube. I\r\nbrought along a piece of platinum from the power plant, and something\r\nthat I think is tantalum from Barkovis' description of it. With those\r\nand the fractions we melted out, I think I can make everything we'll\r\nneed.\"\r\n\r\nNow that he had comparatively pure metal with which to work, drawing\r\nthe leads and filaments was relatively a simple task. Working over\r\nthe hot-bench with torch and welding projector, he made short work of\r\nrunning the leads through the almost plastic glass of the great tube and\r\nof sealing them in place. The plates and grids presented more serious\r\nproblems; but they were solved and, long before Titan was reached, the\r\ntube was out in space, supported by a Titanian tractor beam between the\r\ntwo vessels. Stevens came into the shop, holding a modified McLeod gauge\r\nwhich he had just taken from the interior of the tube. When it had come\r\nto equilibrium, he read it carefully and yelled.\r\n\r\n\"Eureka, little fellow! She's down to where I can't read it, even on\r\nthis big gauge--so hard that it won't need flashing--harder than any\r\nvacuum I ever got on Tellus, even with a Rodebush-Michalek super-pump!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about occluded and absorbed gas in the filaments and so on when\r\nthey heat up?\" demanded Nadia, practically.\r\n\r\n\"All gone, ace. I out-gassed 'em plenty out there--seven times, almost\r\nto fusion. There isn't enough gas left in the whole thing to make a deep\r\nbreath for a microbe.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up his welding projector and a beam carried him back to the\r\ntube. There, in the practically absolute vacuum of space, the last\r\nopenings in the glass were sealed, and man and great transmitting tube\r\nwere wafted lightly back into the Terrestrial cruiser.\r\n\r\nHour after hour mirrored Titanian sphere and crude-fashioned terrestrial\r\nwedge bored serenely on through space, and it was not until Titan loomed\r\nlarge beneath them that the calm was broken by an insistent call from\r\nTitan to the sphere.\r\n\r\n\"Barkodar, attention! Barkodar, attention!\" screamed from the speakers,\r\nand they heard Barkovis acknowledge the call.\r\n\r\n\"The Sedlor have broken through and are marching upon Titania. The order\r\nhas gone out for immediate mobilization of every unit.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's that word 'Sedlor' again--what are they, anyway, Steve?\"\r\ndemanded Nadia.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I was going to ask him when he sprung it on us first, but\r\nhe was pretty busy then and I haven't thought of it since. Something\r\npretty serious, though--they've jumped their acceleration almost to\r\nTellurian gravity, and none of them can live through much of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tellurians?\" came the voice of Barkovis from the speaker. \"We have\r\njust....\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--we were on your wave and heard it,\" interrupted Stevens. \"We're\r\nwith you. What are those Sedlor, anyway? Maybe we can help you dope out\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps--but whatever you do, do not use your heat-projector. That\r\nwould start a conflagration raging over the whole country, and we shall\r\nhave enough to do without fighting fire. But it may be that you have\r\nother weapons, of which we are ignorant, and I can use a little time in\r\nexplanation before we arrive. The Sedlor are a form of life, something\r\nlike your...\" he paused, searching through his scanty store of Earthly\r\nknowledge, then went on, doubtfully, \"perhaps some thing like your\r\ninsects. They developed a sort of intelligence, and because of their\r\nfecundity, adapted themselves to their environment as readily as did\r\nman; and for ages they threatened man's supremacy upon Titan. They\r\ndevoured vegetation, crops, animals, and mankind. After a world-wide\r\ncampaign, however, they were finally exterminated, save in the\r\nneighborhood of one great volcanic crater, which they so honeycombed\r\nthat it is almost impregnable. All around that district we have erected\r\nbarriers of force, maintained by a corps of men known as 'Guardians of\r\nthe Sedlor.' These barriers extend so far into the ground and so high\r\ninto the air that the Sedlor can neither burrow beneath them nor fly\r\nover them. They were being advanced as rapidly as possible, and in a\r\nfew more years the insects would have been destroyed completely--but\r\nnow they are again at large. They have probably developed an armor or\r\na natural resistance greater than the Guardians thought possible, so\r\nthat when the walls were weakened, they came through in their millions,\r\nunderground and undetected. They are now attacking our nearest city--the\r\none you know, and which you have called Titania.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you use--those high-explosive bombs?\"\r\n\r\n\"The bombs were developed principally for use against them, but proved\r\nworse than useless, for we found that when a Sedlor was blown to pieces,\r\neach piece forthwith developed into a new, complete creature. Our most\r\nefficient weapons are our heat rays--not yours remember--and poison gas.\r\nI must prepare our arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would our heat-ray actually set them afire, Steve?\" Nadia asked, as the\r\nplate went blank.\r\n\r\n\"I'll say it would. I'll show you what heat means to them--showing\r\nyou will be plainer than any amount of explanation,\" and he shot the\r\nvisiray beam down toward the city of Titania. Into a low-lying building\r\nit went, and Nadia saw a Titanian foundry in full operation. Men clad\r\nin asbestos armor were charging, tending, and tapping great electric\r\nfurnaces and crucibles; shrinking back and turning their armored heads\r\naway as the hissing, smoking melt crackled into the molds from their\r\nlong-handled ladles. Nadia studied the foundry for a moment, interested,\r\nbut unimpressed.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's hot there--foundries always _are_ hot,\" she argued.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you haven't got the idea yet.\" Stevens turned again to the\r\ncontrols, following the sphere toward what was evidently a line of\r\nbattle. \"That stuff that they are melting and casting and that is so\r\nhot, is not metal, but _ice!_ Remember that the vital fluid of all life\r\nhere, animal and vegetable, corresponding to our water, is probably\r\nmore inflammable than gasoline. If they can't work on ice-water without\r\nwearing suits of five-ply asbestos, what would a real heat-ray do to\r\nthem? It'd be about like our taking a dive into the sun!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ice_!\" she exclaimed. \"Oh of course--but you couldn't really believe\r\na thing like that without seeing it, could you? Oh, Steve--how utterly\r\nhorrible!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"Barkodar\" had dropped down into a line of sister ships, and had\r\ngone into action in midair against a veritable swarm of foes. Winged\r\ncentipedes they were--centipedes fully six feet long, hurling themselves\r\nalong the ground and through the air in furious hordes. From the flying\r\nglobes emanated pale beams of force, at the touch of which the Sedlor\r\ndisappeared in puffs of vapor. Upon the ground huge tractors and trucks,\r\nmanned by masked soldiery, mounted mighty reflectors projecting the same\r\nlethal beam. From globes and tanks there sounded a drumming roar and\r\nsmall capsules broke in thousands among the foe; emitting a red cloud of\r\ngas in which the centipedes shriveled and died. But for each one that\r\nwas destroyed two came up from holes in the ground and the battle-line\r\nfell back toward Titania, back toward a long line of derrick-like\r\nstructures which were sinking force-rods into the ground in furious\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\nStevens flashed on his ultra-violet projector and swung it into the\r\nthickest ranks of the enemy. In the beam many of the monsters died,\r\nbut the Terrestrial ray was impotent compared with the weapons of the\r\nTitanians, and Stevens, snapping off the beam with a bitter imprecation,\r\nshot the visiray out toward the bare, black cone of the extinct volcano\r\nand studied it with care.\r\n\r\n\"Barkovis, I've got a thought!\" he snapped into the microphone. \"Their\r\nstronghold is in that mountain, and there's millions of them in there\r\nyet, coming out along their tunnels. They've got all the vegetation\r\neaten away for miles, so there's nothing much left there to spread a\r\nfire if I go to work on that hill, and, I'll probably melt enough water\r\nto put out most of the fires I start. Detail me a couple of ships to\r\ndrop your fire-foam bombs on any little blazes that may spread, and I'll\r\ngive them so much to worry about at home, that they'll forget all about\r\nTitania.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Forlorn Hope_ darted toward the crater, followed closely by two of\r\nthe dazzling globes. They circled the mountain until Stevens found a\r\nfavorable point of attack--a stupendous vertical cliff of mingled rock\r\nand crystal, upon the base of which he trained his terrific infra-red\r\nprojector.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to draw a lot of power,\" he warned the Titanians then. \"I'm\r\ngiving this gun everything she'll take.\"\r\n\r\nHe drove the massive switches in, and as that dull red beam struck the\r\ncliff's base there was made evident the awful effect of a concentrated\r\nbeam of real and pure heat upon such an utterly frigid world. Vast\r\ncolumns of fire roared aloft, helping Stevens, melting and destroying\r\nthe very ground as the bodies of the Sedlor in that gigantic ant-heap\r\nburst into flames. Clouds of superheated steam roared upward, condensing\r\ninto a hot rain which descended in destructive torrents upon the\r\nfastnesses of the centipedes. As the raging beam ate deeper and deeper\r\ninto the base of the cliff, the mountain itself began to disintegrate;\r\nblock after gigantic block breaking off and crashing down into the\r\nflaming, boiling, seething cauldron which was the apex of that ravening\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nHour after hour Stevens drove his intolerable weapon into the great\r\nmountain, teeming with Sedlorean life; and hour after hour a group of\r\nTitanian spheres stood by, deluging the surrounding plain with a flood\r\nof heavy fumes, through which the holocaust could not spread for lack of\r\noxygen. Not until the mountain was gone--not until in its stead there\r\nlay a furiously boiling lake, its flaming surface hundreds of feet below\r\nthe level of the plain--did Stevens open his power circuits and point\r\nthe deformed prow of the _Forlorn Hope_ toward Titania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Return to Ganymede\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Must you go back to Ganymede?\" Barkovis asked, slowly and\r\nthoughtfully. He was sitting upon a crystal bench beside the fountain,\r\ntalking with Stevens, who, dressed in his bulging space-suit, stood near\r\nan airlock of the _Forlorn Hope_. \"It seems a shame that you should face\r\nagain those unknown, monstrous creatures who so inexcusably attacked us\r\nboth without provocation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so keen on it myself, but I can't see any other way out of it,\"\r\nthe Terrestrial replied. \"We left a lot of our equipment there, you\r\nknow; and even if I should build duplicates here, it wouldn't do us any\r\ngood. These ten-nineteens are the most powerful transmitting tubes known\r\nwhen we left Tellus, but even their fields, dense as they are, can't\r\nhold an ultra-beam together much farther than about six astronomical\r\nunits. So you see we can't possibly reach our friends from here with\r\nthis tube; and your system of beam transmission won't hold anything\r\ntogether even that far, and won't work on any wave shorter than Roeser's\r\nRays. We may run into some more of those little spheres, though, and I\r\ndon't like the prospect. I wonder if we couldn't plate a layer of that\r\nmirror of yours upon the _Hope_ and carry along a few of those bombs? By\r\nthe way, what is that explosive--or is it something beyond Tellurian\r\nchemistry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Its structure should be clear to you, although you probably could not\r\nprepare it upon Tellus because of your high temperature. It is nothing\r\nbut nitrogen--twenty-six atoms of nitrogen combined to form one molecule\r\nof what you would call--N-twenty-six?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" Stevens whistled. \"Crystalline, pentavalent nitrogen--no wonder\r\nit's violent!\"\r\n\r\n\"We could, of course, cover your vessel with the mirror, but I am afraid\r\nthat it would prove of little value. The plates are so hot that it would\r\nsoon volatilize.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily,\" argued Stevens. \"We could live in number one\r\nlife-boat, and shut off the heat everywhere else. The life-boats are\r\ninsulated from the structure proper, and the inner and outer walls of\r\nthe structure are insulated from each other. With only the headquarters\r\nlifeboat warm, the outer wall could be held pretty close to zero\r\nabsolute.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true. The bombs, of course, are controlled by radio, and\r\ntherefore may be attached to the outer wall of your vessel. We shall be\r\nglad to do these small things for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe heaters of the _Forlorn Hope_ were shut off, and as soon as the\r\nouter shell had cooled to Titanian temperature, a corps of mechanics set\r\nto work. A machine very like a concrete mixer was rolled up beside the\r\nsteel vessel, and into its capacious maw were dumped boxes and barrels\r\nof dry ingredients and many cans of sparkling liquid. The resultant\r\npaste was pumped upon the steel plating in a sluggish, viscid stream,\r\nwhich spread out into a thick and uniform coating beneath the flying\r\nrollers of the skilled Titanian workmen. As it hardened, the paste\r\nsmoothed magically into the perfect mirror which covered the\r\nspace-vessels of the satellite; and a full dozen of the mirror explosive\r\nbombs of this strange people were hung in the racks already provided.\r\n\r\n\"Once again I must caution you concerning those torpedoes,\" Barkovis\r\nwarned Stevens. \"If you use them all, very well, but do not try to take\r\neven one of them into any region where it is very hot, for it will\r\nexplode and demolish your vessel. If you do not use them, destroy them\r\nbefore you descend into the hot atmosphere of Ganymede. The mirror will\r\nvolatilize harmlessly at the temperature of melting mercury, but the\r\ntorpedoes must be destroyed. Once more, Tellurians, we thank you for\r\nwhat you have done, and wish you well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks a lot for _your_ help--we still owe you something,\" replied\r\nStevens. \"If either of your power-plants go sour on you again, or if\r\nyou need any more built, be sure to let us know--you can come close\r\nenough to the inner planets now on your own beam to talk to us on the\r\nultra-communicator. We'll be glad to help you any way we can--and we may\r\ncall on you for help again. Goodbye, Barkovis--goodbye, all Titania!\"\r\n\r\nHe made his way through the bitterly cold shop into the control-room of\r\ntheir lifeboat, and while he was divesting himself of his heavy suit,\r\nNadia lifted the _Forlorn Hope_ into the blue-green sky of Titan,\r\naccompanied by an escort of the mirrored globes. Well clear of the\r\natmosphere of the satellite, the terrestrial cruiser shot forward at\r\nnormal acceleration, while the Titanian vessels halted and wove a\r\npattern of blue and golden rays in salute to the departing guests.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Nadia, we're off--on a long trek, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Said Wun Long Hop, the Chinese pee-lo,\" Nadia agreed. \"Sure\r\neverything's all x, big boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"To nineteen decimals,\" he declared. \"You couldn't squeeze another frank\r\ninto our accumulators with a proof-bar, and since they're sending us all\r\nthe power we want to draw, we won't need to touch our batteries or tap\r\nour own beam until we're almost to Jupiter. To cap the climax, what it\r\ntakes to make big medicine on those spherical friends of ours, we've\r\ngot. We're not sitting on top of the world, ace--we've perched exactly\r\nat the apex of the entire universe!\"\r\n\r\n\"How long is it going to take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know. Haven't figured it yet, but it'll be _beaucoup_ days,\" and\r\nthe two wanderers from far-distant Earth settled down to the routine of\r\na long and uneventful journey.\r\n\r\nThey gave Saturn and his spectacular rings a wide berth and sped on,\r\nwith ever-increasing velocity. Past the outer satellites, on and on,\r\nthe good ship _Forlorn Hope_ flew into the black-and-brilliant depths of\r\ninterplanetary space. Saturn was an ever-diminishing disk beneath them:\r\nabove them was Jupiter's thin crescent, growing ever larger and more\r\nbright, and the Monarch of the Solar System, remaining almost stationary\r\nday after day, increasing steadily in apparent diameter and in\r\nbrilliance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the voyage from Titan to Ganymede was long, it was not\r\nmonotonous, for there was much work to be done in the designing and\r\nfabrication of the various units which were to comprise the ultra-radio\r\ntransmitting station. In the various compartments of the _Forlorn Hope_\r\nthere were sundry small motors, blowers, coils, condensers, force-field\r\ngenerators, and other items which Stevens could use with little or no\r\nalteration; but for the most part he had to build everything himself.\r\nThus it was that time passed quickly; so quickly that Jupiter loomed\r\nlarge and the Saturnian beam of power began to attenuate almost before\r\nthe Terrestrials realized that their journey was drawing to an end.\r\n\r\n\"Our beam's falling apart fast,\" Stevens read his meters carefully, then\r\nswung his communicator beam toward Jupiter. \"We aren't getting quite\r\nenough power to hold our acceleration at normal--think I'll cut now,\r\nwhile we're still drawing enough to let the Titanians know we're off\r\ntheir beam. We've got lots of power of our own now; and we're getting\r\npretty close to enemy territory, so they may locate that heavy beam.\r\nHave you found Ganymede yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it will be on the other side of Jupiter by the time we get there.\r\nShall I detour, or put on a little more negative and wait for it to come\r\naround to this side?\"\r\n\r\n\"Better wait, I think. The farther away we stay from Jupiter and the\r\nmajor satellites, the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--it's on. Suppose we'd better start standing watches, in case\r\nsome of them show up?\"\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" he dissented. \"I've been afraid to put out our\r\nelectromagnetic detectors, as they could surely trace them in use.\r\nWithout them, we couldn't spot an enemy ship even if we were looking\r\nright at it, except by accident; since they won't be lighted up and\r\nit's awfully hard to see anything out here, anyway. We probably won't\r\nknow they're within a million kilometers until they put a beam on us.\r\nBarkovis says that this mirror will reflect any beam they can use, and\r\nI've already got a set of photo-cells in circuit to ring an alarm at\r\nthe first flash off of our mirror plating. I'd like to get in the first\r\nlicks myself, but I haven't been able to dope out any way of doing it.\r\nSo you might as well sleep in your own room, as usual, and I'll camp\r\nhere right under the panel until we get to Ganymede. There's a couple\r\nof little things I just thought of, though, that may help some; and\r\nI'm going to do 'em right now.\"\r\n\r\nPutting on his space-suit, he picked up a power drill and went out into\r\nthe bitter cold of the outer structure. There he attacked the inner\r\nwall of their vessel, and the carefully established inter-wall vacuum\r\ndisappeared in a screaming hiss of air as the tempered point bit through\r\nplate after plate.\r\n\r\n\"What's the idea, Steve?\" Nadia asked, when he had re-entered the\r\ncontrol room. \"Now you'll have all that pumping to do over again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Protection for the mirrors,\" he explained. \"You see, they aren't\r\nperfect reflectors. There's a little absorption, so that some stuff\r\ncomes through. Not much, of course; but enough to kill some of those\r\nTitanians and almost enough to ruin their ship got through in about ten\r\nminutes, and only one enemy was dealing it out. We can stand more than\r\nthey could, of course, but the mirror itself won't stand much more heat\r\nthan it was absorbing then. But with air in those spaces instead of\r\nvacuum, and with the whole mass of the _Hope_, except this one lifeboat,\r\nas cold as it is, I figure that there'll be enough conduction and\r\nconvection through them to keep the outer wall and the mirror cold--cool\r\nenough, at least, to hold the mirror on for an hour. If only one ship\r\ntackles us, it won't be bad--but I figure that if there's only one,\r\nwe're lucky.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStevens' fears were only too well grounded, for during the \"evening\" of\r\nthe following day, while he was carefully scanning the heavens for some\r\nsign of enemy craft, the alarm bell over his head burst into its brazen\r\nclamor. Instantly he shot out the detectors and ultra-lights and saw not\r\none, but six of the deadly globes--almost upon them, at point-blank\r\nrange! One was already playing a beam of force upon the _Forlorn Hope_,\r\nand the other five went into action immediately upon feeling the\r\ndetector impulses and perceiving that the weapon of their sister ship\r\nhad encountered an unusual resistance in the material of that peculiarly\r\nmirrored wedge. As those terrific forces struck her, the terrestrial\r\ncruiser became a vast pyrotechnic set piece, a dazzling fountain of\r\ncoruscant brilliance: for the mirror held. The enemy beams shot back\r\nupon themselves and rebounded in all directions, in the same spectacular\r\nexhibition of frenzied incandescence which had marked the resistance of\r\nthe Titanian sphere to a similar attack.\r\n\r\nBut Stevens was not idle. In the instant of launching his detectors,\r\nas fast as he could work the trips, four of the frightful nitrogen\r\nbombs of Titan--all that he could handle at once--shot out into space,\r\ntheir rocket-tubes flaring viciously. The enemy detectors of course\r\nlocated the flying torpedoes immediately, but, contemptuous of material\r\nprojectiles, the spheres made no attempt to dodge, but merely lashed out\r\nupon them with their ravening rays. So close was the range that they\r\nhad no time to avoid the radio-directed bombs after discovering that\r\ntheir beams were useless against the unknown protective covering of\r\nthose mirrored shells. There were four practically simultaneous\r\ndetonations--silent, but terrific explosions as the pent-up internal\r\nenergy of solid pentavalent nitrogen was instantaneously released--and\r\nthe four insensately murderous spheres disappeared into jagged fragments\r\nof wreckage, flying wildly away from the centers of explosion. One great\r\nmass of riven and twisted metal was blown directly upon the fifth globe,\r\nand Nadia stared in horrified fascination at the silent crash as the\r\nentire side of the ship crumpled inward like a shell of cardboard under\r\nthe awful impact. That vessel was probably out of action, but Stevens\r\nwas taking no chances. As soon as he had clamped a pale blue tractor rod\r\nupon the sixth and last of the enemy fleet, he drove a torpedo through\r\nthe gaping wall and into the interior of the helpless war-vessel. There\r\nhe exploded it, and the awful charge, detonated in that confined space,\r\nliterally tore the globular space-ship to bits.\r\n\r\n\"We'll show these jaspers what kind of trees make shingles!\" he gritted\r\nbetween clenched teeth; and his eyes, hard now as gray iron, fairly\r\nemitted sparks as he launched four torpedoes upon the sole remaining\r\nglobe of the squadron of the void. \"I've had a lot of curiosity to know\r\njust what kind of unnatural monstrosities can possibly have such\r\nfiendish dispositions as they've got--but beasts, men or devils, they'll\r\nfind they've grabbed something this time they can't let go of,\" and\r\nfierce blasts of energy ripped from the exhausts as he drove his\r\nmissiles, at their highest possible acceleration, toward the captive\r\nsphere so savagely struggling at the extremity of his tractor beam.\r\n\r\nBut that one remaining vessel was to prove no such easy victim as had\r\nits sister ships. Being six to one, and supposedly invincible, the\r\nsquadron had been overconfident and had attacked carelessly, with only\r\nits crippling slicing beams instead of its more deadly weapons of total\r\ndestruction; and so fierce and hard had been Stevens' counter-attack\r\nthat five of its numbers had been destroyed before they realized what\r\npowerful armament was mounted by that apparently crude, helpless,\r\nand innocuous wedge. The sixth, however, was fully warned, and every\r\nresource at the command of its hellish crew was now being directed\r\nagainst the _Forlorn Hope_.\r\n\r\nSheets, cones, and gigantic rods of force flashed and crackled. Space\r\nwas filled with silent, devastating tongues of flame. The _Forlorn\r\nHope_ was dragged about erratically as the sphere tried to dodge those\r\nhurtling torpedoes; tried to break away from the hawser of energy\r\nanchoring her so solidly to her opponent. But the linkage held, and\r\ncloser and closer Stevens drove the fourfold menace of his frightful\r\ndirigible bombs. Pressor beams beat upon them in vain. Hard driven as\r\nthose pushers were, they could find no footing, but were reflected at\r\nmany angles by that untouchable mirror and their utmost force scarcely\r\nimpeded the progress of the rocket-propelled missiles. Comparatively\r\nsmall as the projectiles were, however, they soon felt the effects of\r\nthe prodigious beams of heat enveloping them, and torpedo after torpedo\r\nexploded harmlessly in space as their mirrors warmed up and volatilized.\r\nBut for each bomb that was lost, Stevens launched another, and each one\r\ncame closer to its objective than had its predecessor.\r\n\r\nMade desperate by the failure of his every beam, the enemy commander\r\nthought to use material projectiles himself--weapons abandoned long\r\nsince by his race as antiquated and inefficient, but a few of which were\r\nstill carried by the older types of vessels. One such shell was found\r\nand launched--but in the instant of its launching Stevens' foremost bomb\r\nstruck its mark and exploded. So close were the other three bombs, that\r\nthey also let go at the shock; and the warlike sphere, hemmed in by four\r\ncenters of explosions, flew apart--literally pulverized. Its projectile,\r\nso barely discharged, did not explode--it was loaded with material which\r\ncould be detonated only by the warhead upon impact or by a radio signal.\r\nIt was, however, deflected markedly from its course by the force of the\r\nblast, so that instead of striking the _Forlorn Hope_ in direct central\r\nimpact, its head merely touched the apex of the mirror-plated wedge.\r\nThat touch was enough. There was another appalling concussion, another\r\nblinding glare, and the entire front quarter of the terrestrial vessel\r\nhad gone to join the shattered globes.\r\n\r\nBetween the point of explosion and the lifeboats there had been many\r\nchannels of insulation, many bulkheads, many air-breaks, and compartment\r\nafter compartment of accumulator cells. These had borne the brunt of the\r\nexplosion, so that the control room was unharmed, and Stevens swung his\r\ncommunicator rapidly through the damaged portions of the vessels.\r\n\r\n\"How badly are we hurt, Steve--can we make it to Ganymede?\"\r\n\r\nNadia was quietly staring over his shoulder into the plate, studying\r\nwith him the pictures of destruction there portrayed as he flashed the\r\nprojector from compartment to compartment.\r\n\r\n\"We're hurt--no fooling--but it might have been a lot worse,\" he\r\nreplied, as he completed the survey. \"We've lost about all of our\r\naccumulators, but we can land on our own beam, and landing power is all\r\nwe want, I think. You see, we're drifting straight for where Ganymede\r\nwill be, and we'd better cut out every bit of power we're using, even\r\nthe heaters, until we get there. This lifeboat will hold heat for quite\r\na while, and I'd rather get pretty cold than meet any more of that gang.\r\nI figured eight hours just before they met us, and we were just about\r\ndrifting then. I think it is safe to say seven hours blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can't they detect us anyway? They may have sent out a call, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we aren't using any power for anything, their electromagnetics are\r\nthe only things we'll register on, and they're mighty short-range\r\nfinders. Even if they should get that close to us, they'll probably\r\nthink we're meteoric, since we'll be dead to their other instruments.\r\nLuckily we've got lots of air, so the chemical purifiers can handle it\r\nwithout power. I'll shut off everything and we'll drift it. Couldn't do\r\nmuch of anything, anyway--even our shop out there won't hold air. But we\r\ncan have light. We've got acetylene emergency lamps, you know, and we\r\ndon't need to economize on oxygen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we'd better run in the dark. Remember what you told me about\r\ntheir possible visirays, and that you've got only two bombs left.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x; that would be better. If I forget it, remind me to blow up those\r\nbefore we hit the atmosphere of Ganymede, will you?\" He opened all the\r\npower switches, and, every source of ethereal vibrations cut off, the\r\n_Forlorn Hope_ drifted slowly on, now appearing forlorn indeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeven hours dragged past: seven age-long hours during which the two sat\r\ntense, expecting they knew not what, talking only at intervals and in\r\nsubdued tones. Stevens then snapped on the communicator beam just long\r\nenough to take an observation upon Ganymede. Several such brief glimpses\r\nwere taken; then, after a warning word to his companion, he sent out and\r\nexploded the nitrogen bombs. He then threw on the power, and the vessel\r\nleaped toward the satellite under full acceleration. Close to the\r\natmosphere it slanted downward in a screaming, fifteen-hundred-mile\r\ndrive; and soon the mangled wedge dropped down into the little canyon,\r\nwhich for so long had been \"home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, colonel, home again!\" Stevens exulted as he neutralized the\r\ncontrols. \"There's that falls, our power plant, the catapults, 'n'\r\neverything. Now, unless something interrupts us again; we'll run up\r\nour radio tower and give Brandon the long yell.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much more have you got to do before you can start sending?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an awful lot. Everything built--all I've got to do is assemble\r\nit. I should be able to do it easily in a week. Hope nothing else\r\nhappens--if I drag you into any more such messes as those we've just\r\nbeen getting out of by the skin of our teeth, I'll begin to wish that\r\nwe had started out at first to drift it back to Tellus in the _Hope_.\r\nLet's see how much time we've got. We should start shooting one day\r\nafter an eclipse, so that we'll have five days to send. You see, we\r\ndon't want to point our beam too close to Jupiter or to any of the large\r\nsatellites, because the enemy might live there and might intercept it.\r\nWe had an eclipse yesterday--so one week from today, at sunrise, I\r\nstart shooting.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Earth's an evening star now; you can't see it in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to aim at Tellus. I'm shooting at Brandon, and he's never\r\nthere for more than a week or two at a stretch. They're prowling around\r\nout in space somewhere almost all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how can you possibly hope to hit them?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be quite a job of hunting, but not as bad as you might think.\r\nThey probably aren't much, if any, outside the orbit of Mars, and\r\nthey usually stay within a couple of million kilometers or so of the\r\nEcliptic, so we'll start at the sun and shoot our beam in a spiral\r\nto cover that field. We ought to be able to hit them inside of twelve\r\nhours, but if we don't, we'll widen our spiral and keep on trying until\r\nwe do hit them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heavens, Steve! Are you planning on telegraphing steadily for days at\r\na time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, but not by hand, of course--I'll have an automatic sender and\r\nautomatic pointers.\"\r\n\r\nStevens had at his command a very complete machine-shop, he had an ample\r\nsupply of power, and all that remained for him to do was to assemble the\r\nparts which he had built during the long journey from Titan to Ganymede.\r\nTherefore, at sunrise of the designated day, he was ready, and, with\r\nNadia hanging breathless over his shoulder, he closed the switch, a\r\ntoothed wheel engaged a delicate interrupter, and a light sounder began\r\nits strident chatter.\r\n\r\n\"Ganymede point oh four seven ganymede point oh four seven ganymede\r\npoint oh four seven...\" endlessly the message was poured out into the\r\nether, carried by a tight beam of ultra-vibrations and driven by forces\r\nsufficient to propel it well beyond the opposite limits of the orbit\r\nof Mars.\r\n\r\n\"What does it say? I can't read code.\"\r\n\r\nStevens translated the brief message, but Nadia remained unimpressed.\r\n\r\n\"But it doesn't say anything!\" she protested. \"It isn't addressed to\r\nanybody, it isn't signed--it doesn't tell anybody anything about\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all there, ace. You see, since the beam is moving sidewise very\r\nrapidly at that range and we're shooting at a small target, the message\r\nhas to be very short or they won't get it all while the beam's on\r\n'em--it isn't as though we were broadcasting. It doesn't need any\r\naddress, because nobody but the _Sirius_ can receive it--except possibly\r\nthe Jovians. They'll know who's sending it without any signature. It\r\ntells them that Ganymede wants to receive a message on the ultra-band\r\ncentering on forty-seven thousandths. Isn't that enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe. But suppose some of them live right here on Ganymede--you'll\r\nbe shooting right through the ground all night--or suppose that even if\r\nthey don't live here, that they can find our beam some way? Or suppose\r\nthat Brandon hasn't got his machine built yet, or suppose that it isn't\r\nturned on when our beam passes them, or suppose they're asleep then?\r\nA lot of things might happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so many, ace--your first objection is the only one that hasn't got\r\nmore holes in it than a sieve, so I'll take it first. Since our beam is\r\nonly a meter in diameter here and doesn't spread much in the first few\r\nmillion kilometers, the chance of direct reception by the enemy, even\r\nif they do live here on Ganymede, is infinitesimally small. But I don't\r\nbelieve that they live here--at least, they certainly didn't land on\r\nthis satellite. As you suggest, however, it is conceivable that they may\r\nhave detector screens delicate enough to locate our beam at a distance;\r\nbut since in all probability that means a distance of hundreds of\r\nthousands of kilometers, I think it highly improbable. We've got to take\r\nthe same risk anyway, no matter what we do, whenever we start to use any\r\nkind of driving power, so there's no use worrying about it. As for your\r\nlast two objections, I know Brandon and I know Westfall. Brandon will\r\nhave receivers built that will take in any wave possible of propagation,\r\nand Westfall, the cautious old egg, will have them running twenty-four\r\nhours a day, with automatic recorders, finders, and everything else that\r\nBrandon can invent--and believe me, sweetheart, that's a lot of stuff!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's wonderful, the way you three men are,\" replied Nadia thoughtfully,\r\nreading between the lines of Stevens' utterance. \"They knew that you\r\nwere on the _Arcturus_, of course--and they knew that if you were alive\r\nyou'd manage in some way to get in touch with them. And you, away out\r\nhere after all this time, are superbly confident that they are expecting\r\na call from you. That, I think, is one of the finest things I ever heard\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're two of the world's best--absolutely.\" Nadia looked at him,\r\nsurprised, for he had not seen anything complimentary to himself in her\r\nremark. \"Wait until you meet them. They're men, Nadia--real men. And\r\nspeaking of meeting them--please try to keep on loving me after you meet\r\nNorm Brandon, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a simp!\" her brown eyes met his steadily. \"You didn't mean\r\nthat--you didn't even say it, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Back it comes, sweetheart! But knowing myself and knowing those\r\ntwo....\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop it! If Norman Brandon or Quincy Westfall had been here instead\r\nof you, or both of them together, we'd have been here from now on--we\r\nwouldn't even have gotten away from the Jovians!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Now it's your turn to back water, guy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe, a little--if both of them were here, they ought to equal\r\nyou in some things. Brandon says himself that he and Westfall together\r\nmake one scientist--Dad says he says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to believe everything you hear. Neither of them will\r\nadmit that he knows anything or can do anything--that's the way they\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dad has told me a lot about them--how they've always been together\r\never since their undergraduate days. How they studied together all over\r\nthe world, even after they'd been given all the degrees loose. How\r\nthey even went to the other planets to study--to Mars, where they had\r\nto live in space-suits all the time, and to Venus, where they had to\r\ntake ultra-violet treatments every day to keep alive. How they learned\r\neverything that everybody else knew and then went out into space to find\r\nout things that nobody else ever dreamed of. How you came to join them,\r\nand what you three have done since. They're fine, of course--but they\r\naren't _you_,\" she concluded passionately.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank Heaven! I know you love me, Nadia, just as I love you--you\r\nknow I never doubted it. But you'll like them, really. They're a\r\nwonderful team. Brandon's a big brute, you know--fully five centimeters\r\ntaller than I am, and he weighs close to a hundred kilograms--and no\r\nlard, either. He's wild, impetuous, always jumping at conclusions and\r\nworking out theories that seem absolutely ridiculous, but they're\r\nusually sound, even though impractical. Westfall's the practical\r\nmember--he makes Norm pipe down, pins him down to facts, and makes it\r\npossible to put his hunches and wild flashes of genius into workable\r\nform. Quince is a....\"\r\n\r\n\"Now _you_ pipe down! I've heard you rave _so_ much about those two--I'd\r\nlots rather rave about you, and with more reason. I wish that sounder\r\nwould start sounding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our first message hasn't gone half way yet. It takes about forty\r\nminutes for the impulse to get to where I think they are, so that even\r\nif they got the first one and answered it instantly, it would be eighty\r\nminutes before we'd get it. I sort of expect an answer late tonight, but\r\nI won't be disappointed if it takes a week to locate them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" declared the girl, and indeed, very little work was done that\r\nday by either of the castaways.\r\n\r\nSlowly the day wore on, and the receiving sounder remained silent.\r\nSupper was eaten as the sun dropped low and disappeared, but they felt\r\nno desire to sleep. Instead, they went out in front of the steel wall,\r\nwhere Stevens built a small campfire. Leaning back against the wall of\r\ntheir vessel, they fell into companionable silence, which was suddenly\r\nbroken by Stevens.\r\n\r\n\"Nadia, I just had a thought. I'll bet four dollars I've wasted a lot of\r\ntime. They'll certainly have automatic relays on Tellus, to save me the\r\ntrouble of hunting for them, but like an idiot I never thought of it\r\nuntil just this minute, in spite of the speech I made you about them.\r\nI'm going to change those directors right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's quite a job, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, only a few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do it in the morning; you've done enough for one day--maybe you've hit\r\nthem already, any way.\"\r\n\r\nThey again became silent, watching Jupiter, an enormous moon some seven\r\ndegrees in apparent diameter.\r\n\r\n\"Steve, I simply can't get used to such a prodigious moon! Look at the\r\nstripes, and look at that perfectly incredible....\"\r\n\r\nA gong sounded and they both jumped to their feet and raced madly into\r\nthe _Hope_. The ultra-receiver had come to life and the sounder was\r\nchattering insanely--someone was sending with terrific speed, but with\r\nperfect definition and spacing.\r\n\r\n\"That's Brandon's fist--I'd know his style anywhere,\" Stevens shouted,\r\nas he seized notebook and pencil.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me what it says, quick, Steve!\" Nadia implored.\r\n\r\n\"Can't talk--read it!\" Stevens snapped. His hand was flying over the\r\npaper, racing to keep up with the screaming sounder.\r\n\r\n\"...ymede all x stevens ganymede all x stevens ganymede all x placing\r\nand will keep sirius on plane between you and tellus circle fifteen\r\nforty north going tellus first send full data spreading beam to\r\ncover circle fifteen forty quince suggests possibility this message\r\nintercepted and translated personally I think such translation\r\nimpossible and that he is wilder than a hawk but just in case they\r\nshould be supernaturally intelligent....\"\r\n\r\nStevens stopped abruptly and stared at the vociferous sounder.\r\n\r\n\"Don't stop to listen--keep on writing!\" commanded Nadia.\r\n\r\n\"Can't,\" replied the puzzled mathematician. \"It doesn't make sense. It\r\nsounds intelligent--it's made up of real symbols of some kind or other,\r\nbut they don't mean a thing to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I see--he's sending mush on purpose. Read the last phrase!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sure--'mush' is right,\" and with no perceptible break the signals\r\nagain became intelligible.\r\n\r\n\"... if they can translate that they are better scholars than we are\r\nsigning off until hear from you brandon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sounder died abruptly into silence and Nadia sobbed convulsively\r\nas she threw herself into Stevens' arms. The long strain over, the\r\nterrible uncertainty at last dispelled, they were both incoherent for\r\na minute--Nadia glorifying the exploits of her lover, Stevens crediting\r\nthe girl herself and his two fellow-scientists with whatever success had\r\nbeen achieved. A measure of self-control regained, Stevens cut off his\r\nautomatic sender, changed the adjustments of his directors and cut in\r\nhis manually operated sending key.\r\n\r\n\"What waves are you using, anyway?\" asked Nadia, curiously. \"They must\r\nbe even more penetrating than Roeser's Rays, to have such a range, and\r\nRoeser's Rays go right through a planet without even slowing up.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're of the same order as Roeser's--that is, they're sub-electronic\r\nwaves of the fourth order--but they're very much shorter, and hence more\r\npenetrating. In fact, they're the shortest waves yet known, so short\r\nthat Roeser never even suspected their existence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose there's a Jovian space-ship out there somewhere that intercepts\r\nour beams. Couldn't they locate us from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe, and maybe not--we'll just have to take a chance on that. That\r\ngoes right back to what we were talking about this morning. They might\r\nbe anywhere, so the chance of hitting one is very small. It isn't like\r\nhitting the _Sirius_, because we knew within pretty narrow limits where\r\nto look for her, and even at that we had to hunt for her for half a day\r\nbefore we hit her. We're probably safe, but even if they should have\r\nlocated us, we'll probably be able to hide somewhere until the _Sirius_\r\ngets here. Well, the quicker I get busy sending the dope, the sooner\r\nthey can get started.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them to be sure and bring me all my clothes they can find,\r\na gallon of perfume, a barrel of powder, and a carload of Delray's\r\nFantasie chocolates--I've been a savage so long that I want to wallow\r\nin luxury for a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do that--and I want some real cigarettes!\"\r\n\r\nStevens first sent a terse, but complete account of everything that had\r\nhappened to the _Arcturus_, and a brief summary of what he and Nadia\r\nhad done since the cutting up of the IPV. The narrative finished, he\r\nlaunched into a prolonged and detailed scientific discussion of the\r\nenemy and their offensive and defensive weapons. He dwelt precisely and\r\nat length upon the functioning of everything he had seen. Though during\r\nthe long months of their isolation he had been too busy to do any actual\r\nwork upon the weapons of the supposed Jovians, yet his keen mind had\r\nevolved many mathematical and physical deductions, hypotheses, and\r\ntheories, and these he sent out to the _Sirius_, concluding:\r\n\r\n\"There's all the dope I can give you. Figure it out, and don't come at\r\nall until you can come loaded for bear; they're bad medicine. Call us\r\noccasionally, to keep us informed as to when to expect you, but don't\r\ncall too often. We don't want them locating you, and if they should\r\nlocate us through your ray or ours, it would be just too bad. So-long.\r\nStevens and Newton.\"\r\n\r\nNadia had insisted upon staying up and had been brewing pot after pot\r\nof her substitutes for coffee while he sat at the key; and it was\r\nalmost daylight when he finally shut off the power and arose, his\r\nright arm practically paralyzed from the unaccustomed strain of hours\r\nof telegraphing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sweetheart, that's that!\" he exclaimed in relief. \"Brandon and\r\nWestfall are on the job. Nothing to do now but wait, and study up on our\r\nown account on those Jovians' rays. This has been one long day for us,\r\nthough, little ace, and I suggest that we sleep for about a week!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCallisto to the Rescue\r\n\r\n\r\nAll humanity of Callisto, the fourth major satellite of Jupiter,\r\nhad for many years been waging a desperate and apparently hopeless\r\ndefense against invading hordes of six-limbed beings. Every city and\r\ntown had long since been reduced to level fields of lava by the rays\r\nof the invaders. Every building and every trace of human civilization\r\nhad long since disappeared from the surface of the satellite. Far\r\nbelow the surface lay the city of Zbardk, the largest of the few\r\nremaining strongholds of the human race. At one portal of the city a\r\ntorpedo-shaped, stubby-winged rocket plane rested in the carriage of a\r\ncatapult. Near it the captain addressed briefly the six men normally\r\ncomposing his crew.\r\n\r\n\"Men, you already know that our cruise today is not an ordinary patrol.\r\nWe are to go to One, there to destroy a base of the hexans. We have\r\nperhaps one chance in ten thousand of returning. Therefore I am taking\r\nonly one man--barely enough to operate the plane. Volunteers step one\r\npace forward.\"\r\n\r\nThe six stepped forward as one man, and a smile came over the worn\r\nface of their leader as he watched them draw lots for the privilege of\r\naccompanying him to probable death. The two men entered the body of the\r\ntorpedo, sealed the openings and waited.\r\n\r\n\"Free exits?\" snapped the Captain of the Portal, and twelve keen-eyed\r\nobservers studied minutely screens and instrument panels connected to\r\nthe powerful automatic lookout stations beneath the rims of the widely\r\nseparated volcanic craters from which their craft could issue into\r\nCallisto's somber night.\r\n\r\n\"No hexan radiation can be detected from Exit Eight,\" came the report.\r\nThe Captain of the Portal raised an arm in warning, threw in the guides,\r\nand the two passengers were hurled violently backward, deep into their\r\ncushioned seats, as the catapult shot their plane down the runway. As\r\nthe catapult's force was spent automatic trips upon the undercarriage\r\nactuated the propelling rockets and mile after mile, with rapidly\r\nmounting velocity, the plane sped through the tube. As the exit was\r\napproached, the tunnel described a long vertical curve, so that when the\r\nopening into the shaft of the crater was reached and the undercarriage\r\nwas automatically detached, the vessel was projected almost vertically\r\nupward. Such was its velocity and so powerful was the liquid propellant\r\nof its rocket motors, that the eye could not follow the flight of the\r\nwarship as it tore through the thin layer of the atmosphere and hurled\r\nitself out into the depths of space.\r\n\r\n\"Did we get away?\" asked the captain, hands upon his controls and eyes\r\nupon his moving chart of space.\r\n\r\n\"I believe so, sir,\" answered the other officer, at the screens of the\r\nsix periscopic devices which covered the full sphere of vision. \"No\r\nreports from the rim, and all screens blank.\" Once more a vessel had\r\nissued from the jealously secret city of Zbardk without betraying its\r\nexistence to the hated and feared hexans.\r\n\r\nFor a time the terrific rocket motors continued the deafening roar of\r\ntheir continuous explosions, then, the desired velocity having been\r\nattained, they were cut out and for hours the good ship \"Bzark\" hurtled\r\non through the void at an enormous but constant speed toward the distant\r\nworld of One, which it was destined never to reach.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Czuv! Hexan radiation, coordinates twenty two, fourteen, area\r\nsix!\" cried the observer, and the commander swung his own telescopic\r\nfinder into the indicated region. His hands played over course and\r\ndistance plotters for a brief minute, and he stared at his results in\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of a hexan traveling that way before,\" he frowned.\r\n\"Constant negative acceleration and in a straight line. He must think\r\nthat we have been cleared out of the ether. Almost parallel to us and\r\nnot much faster--even at this long range, it is an easy kill unless\r\nhe starts dodging, as usual.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he snapped a switch and from a port under the starboard\r\nwing there shot out into space a small package of concentrated\r\ndestruction--a rocket-propelled, radio-controlled torpedo. The rockets\r\nof the tiny missile were flaming, but that flame was visible only from\r\nthe rear and no radio beam was upon it. Czuv had given it precisely the\r\ndirection and acceleration necessary to make it meet the hexan sphere\r\nin central impact, provided that sphere maintained its course and\r\nacceleration unchanged.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I direct the torpedo in the case the hexan shifts?\" asked the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\"I think not. They can, of course, detect any wave at almost any\r\ndistance, and at the first sign of radioactivity they would locate and\r\ndestroy the bomb. They also, in all probability, would destroy us. I\r\nwould not hesitate to attack them on that account alone, but we must\r\nremember that we are upon a more important mission than attacking one\r\nhexan ship. We are far out of range of their electromagnetic detectors,\r\nand our torpedo will have such a velocity that they will have no time to\r\nprotect themselves against it after detection. Unless they shift in the\r\nnext few seconds, they are lost. This is the most perfect shot I ever\r\nhad at one of them, but one shot is all I dare risk--we must not betray\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCourse, lookout, and rank forgotten, the little crew of two stared\r\ninto the narrow field of vision, set at its maximum magnification. The\r\ninstruments showed that the enemy vessel was staying upon its original\r\ncourse. Very soon the torpedo came within range of the detectors of the\r\nhexans. But as Captain Czuv had foretold, the detection was a fraction\r\nof a second too late, rapidly as their screens responded, and the two\r\nmen of Zbardk uttered together a short, fierce cry of joy as a brilliant\r\nflash of light announced the annihilation of the hexan vessel.\r\n\r\n\"But hold!\" The observer stared into his screen. \"Upon that same line,\r\nbut now at constant velocity, there is still a very faint radiation,\r\nof a pattern I have never seen before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think ... I believe ...\" the captain was studying the pattern,\r\npuzzled. \"It must be low frequency, low-tension electricity, which is\r\nnever used, so far as I know. It may be some new engine of destruction,\r\nwhich the hexan was towing at such a distance that the explosion of our\r\ntorpedo did not destroy it. Since there are no signs of hexan activity\r\nand since it will not take much fuel, we shall investigate that\r\nradiation.\"\r\n\r\nTail and port-side rockets burst into roaring activity and soon the\r\nplane was cautiously approaching the mass of wreckage, which had been\r\nthe IPV _Arcturus_.\r\n\r\n\"Human beings, although of some foreign species!\" exclaimed the captain,\r\nas his vision-ray swept through the undamaged upper portion of the great\r\nliner and came to rest upon Captain King at his desk.\r\n\r\nAlthough the upper ultra-lights of the Terrestrial vessel had been\r\ncut away by the hexan plane of force, jury lights had been rigged,\r\nand the two commanders were soon trying to communicate with each\r\nother. Intelligible conversation was, of course, impossible, but King\r\nsoon realized that the visitors were not enemies. At their pantomimed\r\nsuggestion he put on a space-suit and wafted himself over to the airlock\r\nof the Callistonian warplane. Inside the central compartment, the\r\nstrangers placed over his helmet a heavily wired harness, and he found\r\nhimself instantly in full mental communication with the Callistonian\r\ncommander. For several minutes they stood silent, exchanging thoughts\r\nwith a rapidity impossible in any language; then, dressed in\r\nspace-suits, both leaped lightly across the narrow gap into the still\r\nopen outer lock of the terrestrial liner. King watched Czuv narrowly\r\nafter the pressure began to collapse his suit, but the stranger made\r\nno sign of distress. He had been right in his assurance that the extra\r\npressure would scarcely inconvenience him. King tore off his helmet,\r\nissued a brief order, and soon every speaker in the _Arcturus_\r\nannounced:\r\n\r\n\"All passengers and all members of the crew except lookouts on duty will\r\nassemble immediately in Saloon Three to discuss a possible immediate\r\nrescue.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject being one of paramount interest, it was a matter of minutes\r\nuntil the full complement of two hundred men and women were in the main\r\nsaloon, clinging to hastily rigged hand lines, closely packed before the\r\nraised platform upon which were King and Czuv, wired together with the\r\npeculiar Callistonian harness. To most of the passengers, familiar with\r\nthe humanity of three planets, the appearance of the stranger brought\r\nno surprise; but many of them stared in undisguised amazement at his\r\nchildish body, his pale, almost colorless skin, his small, weak legs and\r\narms, and his massive head.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" Captain King opened the meeting. \"I introduce to\r\nyou Captain Czuv, of the scout cruiser _Bzarvk_, of the only human race\r\nnow living upon the fourth large satellite of Jupiter, which satellite\r\nwe know as Callisto. I am avoiding their own names as much as possible,\r\nbecause they are almost unpronounceable in English or Interplanetarian.\r\nThis device that you see connecting us is a Callistonian thought\r\ntransformer, by means of which any two intelligent beings can converse\r\nwithout language. Our situation is peculiar, and in order that you may\r\nunderstand fully what lies ahead of us, the captain will now speak to\r\nyou, through me--that is, what follows will be spoken by Captain Czuv,\r\nof the _Bzarvk_, but he will be using my vocal organs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends from distant Tellus,\" King's voice went on, almost without a\r\nbreak, \"I greet you. I am glad, for your sake as well as our own, that\r\nyour vessel was able to destroy the hexan ship holding you captive, and\r\nwhose crew would have killed you all as soon as they had landed your\r\nvessel and had read your minds. I regret bitterly that we can do so\r\nlittle for you, for only the representatives of a human civilization\r\nbeing exterminated by a race of highly intelligent monsters can fully\r\nrealize how desirable it is for all the various races of humanity to\r\nassist and support each other. In order that you may understand the\r\nsituation, it is necessary that I delve at some length into ancient\r\nhistory, but we have ample time. In about ...\" he broke off, realizing\r\nthat the two races had no thought in common in the measure of time.\r\n\r\n\"One-half time of rotation of Great Planet upon axis?\" flashed from\r\nCzuv's brain, and \"About five hours,\" King's mind flashed back.\r\n\r\n\"It will be about five hours before any steps can be taken, so that I\r\nfeel justified in using a brief period for explanation. In the evolution\r\nof the various forms of life upon Callisto, two genera developed\r\nintelligence far ahead of all others. One genus was the human, as you\r\nand I; the other the hexan. This creature, happily unknown to you of the\r\nplanets nearer our common sun, is the product of an entirely different\r\nevolution. It is a six-limbed animal, with a brain equal to our own--one\r\nperhaps in some ways superior to our own. They have nothing in common\r\nwith humanity, however; they have few of our traits and fewer of our\r\nmental processes. Even we who have fought them so long can scarcely\r\ncomprehend the chambers of horror that are their minds. Even were I able\r\nto paint a sufficiently vivid picture with words, you of Earth could not\r\nbegin to understand their utter ruthlessness and inhumanity, even among\r\nthemselves. You would believe that I was lying, or that my viewpoint was\r\nwarped. I can say only that I hope most sincerely that none of you will\r\never get better acquainted with them.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Ages ago, then, the human and the hexan developed upon all four of the\r\nmajor satellites of the Great Planet, which you know as Jupiter, and\r\nupon the north polar region of Jupiter itself. By what means the two\r\nraces came into being upon worlds so widely separated in space we know\r\nnot--we only know it to be the fact. Human life, however, could not long\r\nendure upon Jupiter. The various human races, after many attempts to\r\nmeet conditions of life there by variations in type fell before the\r\nhexans; who, although very small in size upon the planet, thrived there\r\namazingly. Upon the three outer satellites humanity triumphed, and many\r\nhundreds of cycles ago the hexans of those satellites were wiped out,\r\nsave for an occasional tribe of savages of low intelligence who lived in\r\nvarious undesirable portions of the three worlds. For ages then there\r\nwas peace upon Callisto. Here is the picture at that time--upon Jupiter\r\nthe hexans; upon Io hexans and humans, waging a ceaseless and relentless\r\nwar of mutual extermination; upon the three outer satellites humanity in\r\nundisturbed and unthreatened peace. Five worlds, each ignorant of life\r\nupon any other.\r\n\r\n\"As I have said, the hexans of Jupiter were, and are, diabolically\r\nintelligent. Driven probably by their desire to see what lay beyond\r\ntheir atmosphere of eternal cloud, to the penetration of which their\r\neyesight was attuned, they developed the space-ship; and effected a\r\nsafe landing, first upon the barren, airless moonlet nearest them, and\r\nthen upon fruitful Io. There they made common cause with the hexans\r\nagainst the humans, and in space of time Ionian humanity ceased to exist.\r\nMuch traffic and interbreeding followed between the hexans of Jupiter\r\nand those of Io, resulting in time in a race intermediate in size\r\nbetween the parent stocks and equally at home in the widely variant air\r\npressures and gravities of planet and satellite. Soon their astronomical\r\ninstruments revealed the cities of Europa to their gaze, and as soon\r\nas they discovered that the civilization of Europa was human, they\r\ndestroyed it utterly, with the insatiable blood lust that is their\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime the human civilizations of Ganymede and Callisto had\r\nalso developed instruments of power. Observing the cities upon the other\r\nsatellites, many scientists studied intensively the problem of space\r\nnavigation, and finally there was some commerce between the two outer\r\nsatellites at favorable times. Finally, vessels were also sent to Io\r\nand to Europa, but none of them returned. Knowing then what to expect,\r\nGanymede and Callisto joined forces and prepared for war. But our\r\nscience, so long attuned to the arts of peace, had fallen behind\r\nlamentably in the devising of more and ever more deadly instruments\r\nof destruction. Ganymede fell, and in her fall we read our own doom.\r\nAbandoning our cities, we built anew underground. Profiting from lessons\r\nlearned full bloodily upon Ganymede, we resolved to prolong the\r\nexistence of the human race as long as possible.\r\n\r\n\"The hexans were, and are masters of the physical science. They\r\ncommand the spectrum in a way undreamed of. Their detectors reveal\r\netheric disturbances at unbelievable distances, and they have at their\r\nbeck and call forces of staggering magnitude. Therefore in our cities\r\nis no electricity save that which is wired, shielded, and grounded;\r\nno broadcast radio; no source whatever of etheric disturbances save\r\nlight--and our walls are fields of force which we believe to be\r\nimpenetrable to any searching frequency capable of being generated.\r\nNow I am able to picture to you the present.\r\n\r\n\"We are the last representatives of the human race in the Jovian\r\nplanetary system. Our every trace upon the surface has been obliterated.\r\nWe are hiding in our holes in the ground, coming out at night by stealth\r\nso that our burrows shall not be revealed to the hexans. We are fighting\r\nfor time in which our scientists may learn the secrets of power--and\r\nfearing, each new day, that the enemy may have so perfected their\r\nsystems of rays that they will be able to detect us and destroy us, even\r\nin our underground and heavily shielded retreats, by means of forces\r\neven more incomprehensible than those they are now employing.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, friends, you see how little we are able to do for you, we\r\na race fighting for our very existence and doomed to extinction save\r\nfor a miracle. We cannot take you to Callisto, for it is besieged by the\r\nhexans and the driving forces of your lifeboats, practically broadcast\r\nas they are, would be detected and we should all be destroyed long\r\nbefore we could reach safety. Captain King and I have pondered long and\r\nhave been able to see only one course of action. We are drifting at\r\nconstant velocity, using no power, and with all save the most vitally\r\nnecessary machinery at rest. Thus only may we hope to avoid detection\r\nduring the next two hours.\r\n\r\n\"Our present course will take us very close to Europa, which the hexans\r\nbelieve to be like Ganymede, entirely devoid of civilized life. Its\r\noriginal humanity was totally destroyed, and all its civilized hexans\r\nare finding shelter from our torpedoes upon Jupiter until we of Callisto\r\nshall likewise have been annihilated. The temperature of Europa will\r\nsuit you. Its atmosphere, while less dense than that to which you are\r\naccustomed, will adequately support your life. If we are not detected\r\nin the course of the next few hours we can probably land upon Europa in\r\nsafety, since its neighborhood is guarded but loosely. In fact, we have\r\na city there, as yet unsuspected by the hexans, in which our scientists\r\nwill continue to labor after Callisto's civilization shall have\r\ndisappeared. We think that it will be safe to use your power for the\r\nshort time necessary to effect a landing. We shall land in a cavern,\r\nin a crater already in communication with our city. In that cavern,\r\ninstructed and aided by some of us, you will build a rocket vessel--no\r\nrays can be used because of the hexans--in which you will be able to\r\ntravel to a region close enough to your earth so that you can call for\r\nhelp. You will not be able to carry enough fuel to land there--in fact,\r\nnearly all the journey will have to be made without power, traveling\r\nfreely in a highly elongated orbit around the sun--but if you escape the\r\nhexans, you should be able to reach home safely, in time. It is for the\r\nconsideration of this plan that this meeting has been called.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Just one question,\" Breckenridge spoke. \"The hexans are intelligent.\r\nWhy are they leaving Europa and Ganymede so unguarded that human beings\r\ncan move back there and that we can land there, all undetected?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will answer that question myself,\" replied King. \"Captain Czuv did\r\nnot quite do justice to his own people. It is true that they are being\r\nconquered, but for every human life that is taken, a thousand hexans\r\ndie, and for every human ship that is lost, twenty hexan vessels are\r\nannihilated in return. While the hexans are masters of rays, the\r\nhumans are equally masters of explosives and of mechanisms. They can\r\nhit a perfect score upon any target in free space whose course and\r\nacceleration can be determined, at any range up to five thousand\r\nkilometers, and they have explosives thousands of times as powerful as\r\nany known to us. Ray screens are effective only against rays, and the\r\nhexans cannot destroy anything they cannot see before it strikes them.\r\nSo it is that all the hexan vessels except those necessary to protect\r\ntheir own strongholds, are being concentrated against Callisto. They\r\ncannot spare vessels to guard uselessly the abandoned satellites.\r\nBecause of the enormously high gravity of Jupiter the hexans there are\r\nsafe from human attack save for ineffectual long-range bombardment, but\r\nIo is being attacked constantly and it is probable that in a few more\r\nyears Io also will be an abandoned world. Some of you may have received\r\nthe impressions that the hexans are to triumph immediately, but such an\r\nidea is wrong. The humans can, and will, hold out for a hundred years or\r\nmore unless the enemy perfects a destructive ray of the type referred\r\nto. Even then, I think that our human cousins will hold out a long time.\r\nThey are able men, fighters all, and their underground cities are\r\nbeautifully protected.\"\r\n\r\nThere was little argument. Most of the auditors could understand that\r\nthe suggested course was the best one possible. The remainder were\r\nso stunned by the unbelievable events of the attack that they had no\r\ninitiative, but were willing to follow wherever the more valiant spirits\r\nled. It was decided that no attempt should be made to salvage any\r\nportion of the _Arcturus_, since any such attempt would be fraught with\r\ndanger and since the wreckage would be of little value. The new vessel\r\nwas to be rocket driven and was to be built of Callistonian alloys.\r\nPersonal belongings were moved into lifeboats, doors were closed, and\r\nthere ensued a painful period of waiting and suspense.\r\n\r\nThe stated hour was reached without event--no hexan scout had come\r\nclose enough to them to detect the low-tension radiation of the vital\r\nmachinery of the _Arcturus_, cut as it was to the irreducible minimum\r\nand quite effectively grounded as it was by the enormous mass of her\r\nshielding armor. At a signal from Captain Czuv the pilot of each\r\nlifeboat shot his tiny craft out into space and took his allotted place\r\nin the formation following closely behind the _Bzarvk_, flying toward\r\nEuropa, now so large in the field of vision that she resembled more a\r\nworld than a moon. Captain King, in the Callistonian vessel, transmitted\r\nto Breckenridge the route and flight data given him by the navigator of\r\nthe winged craft. The chief pilot, flying \"point,\" in turn relayed more\r\ndetailed instructions to the less experienced pilots of the other\r\nlifeboats.\r\n\r\nSoon the surface of Europa lay beneath them; a rugged, cratered, and\r\ntorn topography of mighty ranges of volcanic mountains. Most of the\r\ncraters were cold and lifeless; but here and there a plume of smoke\r\nand steam betrayed the presence of vast, quiescent forces. Straight\r\ndown one of those gigantic lifeless shafts the fleet of space craft\r\ndropped--straight down a full two miles before the landing signal was\r\ngiven. At the bottom of the shaft a section of the rocky wall swung\r\naside, revealing the yawning black mouth of a horizontal tunnel. At\r\nintervals upon its roof there winked into being almost invisible points\r\nof light. Along that line of lights the lifeboats felt their way, coming\r\nfinally into a huge cavern, against one sheer metal wall of which they\r\nparked in an orderly row. Roll was called, and the terrestrials walked,\r\nas well as they could in the feeble gravity of the satellite, across the\r\nvast chamber and into a conveyance somewhat resembling a railway coach,\r\nwhich darted away as soon as the doors were shut. For hundreds of miles\r\nthat strange tunnel extended, and as the car shot along door after door\r\nof natural rock opened before it, and closed as soon as it had sped\r\nthrough. In spite of the high velocity of the vehicle, it required\r\nalmost two hours to complete the journey. Finally, however, it slowed\r\nto a halt and the Terrestrial visitors disembarked at a portal of the\r\nEuropan city of the Callistonians.\r\n\r\n\"Attention!\" barked Captain King. \"The name of this city, as nearly as\r\nI can come to it in English, is _WRUZK_. 'Roosk' comes fairly close to\r\nit and is easier to pronounce. We must finish our trip in small cars,\r\nholding ten persons each. We shall assemble again in the building in\r\nwhich we have been assigned quarters. The driver of each car will lead\r\nhis passengers to the council room in which we shall meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what's the use--this is horrible, horrible--we might as well die!\"\r\na nervous woman shrieked, and fainted.\r\n\r\n\"Such a feeling is, perhaps, natural,\" King went on, after the woman had\r\nbeen revived and quiet had been restored, \"but please control it as much\r\nas possible. We are alive and well, and will be able to return to Tellus\r\neventually. Please remember that these people are putting themselves\r\nto much trouble and inconvenience to help us, desperate as their own\r\nsituation is, and conduct yourselves accordingly.\"\r\n\r\nThe rebuke had its effect, and with no further protest the company\r\nboarded the small cars, which shot through an opening in the wall and\r\ninto a street of that strange subterranean city. Breckenridge, in the\r\nlast car to leave the portal, studied his surroundings with interest as\r\nhis conveyance darted through the gateway. More or less a fatalist by\r\nnature and an adventurer, of course, since no other type existed among\r\nthe older spacehounds of the IPC, he was intensely interested in every\r\nnew phase of their experience, and was no whit dismayed or frightened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe found himself seated in a narrow canoe of metal, immediately behind\r\nthe pilot, who sat at a small control panel in the bow. Propelled by\r\nelectromagnetic fields above a single rail, upon lightly touching and\r\nnoiseless wheels, the terrestrial pilot saw with keen appreciation the\r\nmanner in which switch after switch ahead of them obeyed the impulses\r\nsent ahead from the speeding car. The streets were narrow and filled\r\nwith monorails; pedestrians pursued their courses upon walks attached\r\nto the walls of the buildings, far above the level of the streets. The\r\nwalls were themselves peculiar, rising as they did stark, unbroken,\r\nwindowless expanses of metal, merging into and supporting a massive\r\nroof of the same silvery metal. Walls and roof alike reflected a soft,\r\nyet intense, white light. Soon a sliding switch ahead of them shot in\r\nand simultaneously an opening appeared in the blank metal wall of a\r\nbuilding. Through the opening the street-car flew, and as the pilot\r\nslowed the canoe to a halt, the door slid smoothly shut behind them.\r\nParking the car beside a row of its fellows, the Callistonian driver\r\nindicated that the Terrestrials were to follow him and led the way into\r\na large hall. There the others from the _Arcturus_ were assembled,\r\nfacing Captain King, who was standing upon a table.\r\n\r\n\"Fellow travelers,\" King addressed them, \"our course of action has\r\nbeen decided. There are two hundred three of us. There will be twenty\r\nsections of ten persons, each section being in charge of one of the\r\nofficers of the _Arcturus_. Doctor Penfield, our surgeon, a man whose\r\nintelligence, fairness, and integrity are unquestioned, will be in\r\nsupreme command. His power and authority will be absolute, limited only\r\nby the Callistonian Council. He will work in harmony with the engineer,\r\nwho is to direct the entire project of building the new vessel. Each of\r\nyou will be expected to do whatever he can--the work you will be asked\r\nto do will be well within your powers, and you will each have ample\r\nleisure for recreation, study, and amusement, of all of which you will\r\nfind unsuspected stores in this underground community. You will each\r\nbe registered and studied by physicians, surgeons, and psychologists;\r\nand each of you will have prescribed for him the exact diet that is\r\nnecessary for his best development. You will find this diet somewhat\r\nmonotonous, compared to our normal fare of natural products, since it\r\nis wholly synthetic; but that is one of the minor drawbacks that must\r\nbe endured. Chief Pilot Breckenridge and I will not be with you. In\r\nsome small and partial recompense for what they are doing for us all,\r\nhe and I are going with Captain Czuv to Callisto, there to see whether\r\nor not we can aid them in any way in the fight against the hexans. One\r\nlast word--Doctor Penfield's rulings will be the products of his own\r\nwell-ordered mind after consultation and agreement with the Council of\r\nthis city, and will be for the best good of all. I do not anticipate any\r\nrefusal to cooperate with him. If, however, such refusal should occur,\r\nplease remember that he is a despot with absolute power, and that anyone\r\nobstructing the program by refusing to follow his suggestions will spend\r\nthe rest of his time here in confinement and will go back to Tellus in\r\nirons, if at all. In case Chief Pilot Breckenridge and I should not see\r\nyou again, we bid you goodbye and wish you a safe voyage--but we expect\r\nto go back with you.\"\r\n\r\nBrief farewells were said and captain and pilot accompanied Czuv to one\r\nof the little street-cars. Out of the building it dashed and down the\r\ncrowded but noiseless thoroughfare to the portal. Signal lights flashed\r\nbriefly there and they did not stop, but tore on through the portal and\r\nthe tunnel, with increasing speed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't have to transfer to a big car, then?\" asked Breckenridge.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" King made answer. \"Small cars can travel these tubes as well as\r\nthe large ones, and on much less power. In the city the wheels touch\r\nthe rails lightly, not for support, but to make contacts through which\r\ntraffic signals are sent and received. In the tunnels the wheels do\r\nnot touch at all, as signaling is unnecessary--the tunnels being used\r\ninfrequently and by but one vehicle at a time. No trolleys, tracks, or\r\nwires are visible, you notice. Everything is hidden from any possible\r\nvisiray of the hexans.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about their power?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand it very well--hardly at all, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite simple.\" To the surprise of both Terrestrials, Czuv was\r\nspeaking English, but with a strong and very peculiar accent; slighting\r\nall the vowels and accenting heavily the consonant sounds. \"The car no\r\nlonger requires my attention, so I am now free to converse. You are\r\nsurprised at my knowing your language? You will speak mine after a few\r\nmore applications of the thought exchanger. I am speaking with a vile\r\naccent, of course, but that is merely because my vocal organs are\r\nnot accustomed to making vowel sounds. Our power is obtained by the\r\ncombustion of gases in highly efficient turbines. It is transmitted and\r\nused as direct current, our generator and motors being so constructed\r\nthat they can produce no etheric disturbances capable of penetrating\r\nthe shielding walls of our city. The city was built close to deposits\r\nof coal, oil, and gas of sufficient amount to support our life for\r\nthousands of years; for from these deposits come power, food, clothing,\r\nand all the other necessities and luxuries of our lives. Strong fans\r\ndraw air from various extinct craters, force it through ventilating\r\nducts into every room and recess of the city, and exhaust it into the\r\nshaft of a quiescent volcano, in whose gaseous outflow any trace of our\r\nactivities is, of course, imperceptible. For obvious reasons no rockets\r\nor combustion motors are used in the city proper.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus Captain Czuv explained to the Terrestrials his own mode of life,\r\nand received from them in turn full information concerning Earthly life,\r\nactivity, and science. Long they talked, and it was almost time to slow\r\ndown for the journey's end when the Callistonian brought the conversation\r\nback to their immediate concerns.\r\n\r\n\"My lieutenant and I were upon a mission of some importance, but it is\r\nmore important to take you to Callisto, for there may be many things\r\nin which you can help us. Not in rays--we know all the vibrations you\r\nhave mentioned and several others. The enemy, however, is supreme\r\nin that field, and until our scientists have succeeded in developing\r\nray-screens, such as are used by the hexans, it would be suicidal to\r\nuse rays at all. Such screens necessitate the projection of pure, yet\r\ndirigible, forces--you do not have them upon your planet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, and so far as I know such screens are also unknown upon Mars and\r\nVenus, with whose inhabitants we are friendly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of all the planets should be friendly; the solar\r\nsystem should be linked together in intercourse for common advancement.\r\nBut that is not to be. The hexans will eventually triumph here, and a\r\nJovian system peopled by hexans will have no intercourse with any human\r\ncivilization save that of internecine war. We, of Callisto, have only\r\none hope--or is it really a hope? In the South Polar country of Jupiter,\r\nthere dwells a race of beings implacably hostile to the hexans. They\r\nseem to invade the country of the hexans frequently, even though they\r\nare apparently repulsed each time. Our emissaries to the South Polar\r\ncountry, however, have never returned--those beings, whatever they\r\nare, if not actively inimical, certainly are not friendly toward us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing of their nature?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, since our electrical instruments are not sufficiently\r\nsensitive to give us more than a general idea of what is transpiring\r\nthere, and vision is practically useless in that eternal fog. We know,\r\nhowever, that they are far advanced in science, and we are thankful\r\nindeed that none of their frightful flying fortresses have been launched\r\nagainst us. They apparently are not interested in the satellites, and it\r\nis no doubt due to their unintentional assistance that we have survived\r\nas long as we have.\"\r\n\r\nIn the cavern at last, the three men boarded the Callistonian\r\nspace-plane and were shot up the crater's shaft. The voyage to\r\nCallisto was uneventful, even uninteresting save at its termination.\r\nThe _Bzarvk_, coated every inch as it was with a dull, dead black,\r\ncompletely absorptive outer coating, entered the thin layer of\r\nCallisto's atmosphere in darkest night, with all rockets dead, with not\r\na light showing, and with no apparatus of any kind functioning. Utterly\r\ninvisible and undetectable, she dove downward, and not until she was\r\nwell below the crater's rim did the forward rockets burst into furious\r\nlife. Then the Terrestrials understood another reason for the immense\r\ndepth of those shafts other than that of protection from the detectors\r\nof the enemy--all that distance was necessary to overcome the velocity\r\nof their free fall without employing a negative acceleration greater\r\nthan the frail Callistonian bodies could endure. From the cavern at the\r\nfoot of the shaft, a regulation tunnel extended to the Callistonian city\r\nof Zbardk. Portal and city were very like Wruszk, upon distant Europa,\r\nand soon the terrestrial captain and pilot were in conference with the\r\nCouncil of Callisto.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMonths of Earthly time dragged slowly past, months during which King and\r\nBreckenridge studied intensively the offensive and defensive systems\r\nof Callisto without finding any particular in which they could improve\r\nthem to any considerable degree. Captain Czuv and his warplane still\r\nsurvived, and it was while the Callistonian commander was visiting his\r\nterrestrial guests, that King voiced the discontent that had long\r\naffected both men.\r\n\r\n\"We're both tired of doing nothing, Czuv. We have been of little real\r\nbenefit, and we have decided that your ideas of us are all wrong. We are\r\nconvinced that our personal horsepower can be of vastly more use to you\r\nthan our brain-power, which doesn't amount to much. Your whole present\r\npolicy is one of hiding and sniping. I think that I know why, but I want\r\nto be sure. Your vessels carry lots of fuel--why can the hexans outrun\r\nyou?\" Thus did King put his problem.\r\n\r\n\"They can stand enormously higher accelerations than we can. The very\r\nstrongest of us loses consciousness at an acceleration of twenty-five\r\nmeters per second per second, no matter how he is braced, and that\r\nis only a little greater than the normal gravity of our enemies upon\r\nJupiter. Their vessels at highest power develop an acceleration of\r\nthirty-five meters, and the hexans themselves can stand much more than\r\neven that high figure,\" replied Czuv.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so. Assume that you traveled at forty-five. Would it disable\r\nyou permanently, or would you recover as soon as it was lowered?\"\r\n\r\n\"We would recover promptly, unless the exposure had been unduly\r\nprolonged. Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said King, \"I can stand an acceleration of fifty-four meters\r\nfor two hours, and Breckenridge here tests fifty two meters. I can\r\nnavigate anything, and Breckenridge can observe as well as any of your\r\nown men. Build a plane to accelerate at forty-five meters and we will\r\nblow those hexans out of the ether. You will have to revive and do the\r\nshooting, however--your gunnery is entirely beyond us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is an idea of promise, and one that had not occurred to any of\r\nus,\" Czuv replied and work was begun at once upon the new flyer.\r\n\r\nWhen the super-plane was ready for its maiden voyage, its crew of three\r\nstudied it as it lay in the catapult at the portal. Dead black as were\r\nall the warplanes, its body was twice as large as that of the ordinary\r\nvessel, its wings were even more stubby, and its accommodations had been\r\ncut to a minimum to make room for the enormous stores of fuel necessary\r\nto drive the greatly increased battery of rocket motors and for the\r\nextra supply of torpedoes carried. Waving to the group of soldiers and\r\ncitizens gathered to witness the take-off of the new dreadnought of\r\nspace, the three men entered the cramped operating compartment, strapped\r\nthemselves into their seats, and were shot away. As usual the driving\r\nrockets were cut off well below the rim of the shaft, and the vessel\r\nrose in a long and graceful curve, invisible in the night. Such was its\r\ninitial velocity and so slight was the force of gravity of the satellite\r\nthat they were many hundreds of miles from the exit before they began to\r\ndescend, and Breckenridge studied his screens narrowly for signs of\r\nhexan activity.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to try one of your long-range shots when we find one of\r\nthem?\" the pilot asked Czuv.\r\n\r\n\"No, it would be useless. Between deflection by air-currents and the\r\ndodging of the enemy vessels, our effective range is shortened to a few\r\nkilometers, and their beams are deadly at that distance. No, our best\r\ncourse is to follow the original plan--to lure them out into space at\r\nuniform acceleration, where we can destroy them easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" and Breckenridge turned to King, who was frowning at his\r\ncontrols. \"How does she work on a dead stick, Chief?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maneuverability about minus ten at this speed and in this air.\r\nShe'd have to have at least fifteen hundred kilometers an hour to be\r\nresponsive out here. See anything yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet ... wait a minute! Yes, there's one now--P-12 on area five.\r\nGive us all the X10 and W27 you can, without using power--we want to\r\nedge over close enough so that she can't help but see us when we start\r\nthe rockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be sure and stay well out of range. I'm giving her all she'll take, but\r\nshe won't take much. With these wings she has the gliding angle of a\r\nkitchen sink.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--I'm watching the range, close. Wish we had instruments like\r\nthese on the IPV's. We'll have to install some when we get back. All x!\r\nGive her the gun--level and dead ahead!\"\r\n\r\nHalf the battery of rockets burst into their stuttering, explosive roar\r\nof power and the vessel darted away in headlong flight.\r\n\r\n\"He sees us and is after us--turn her straight up!\"\r\n\r\nA searing, coruscating finger of flame leaped toward them, but their\r\ncalculations had been sound--the hexan was harmless at that extreme\r\nrange. King, under the pilot's direction, kept the plane at a safe\r\ndistance from the sphere while the satellite grew smaller and smaller\r\nbehind them and Czuv lapsed quietly into unconsciousness.\r\n\r\n\"He's been out for quite a while. Far enough?\" asked King.\r\n\r\n\"All x now, I guess--don't believe they can see the flash from here.\r\nCut!\"\r\n\r\nThe rockets died abruptly and a blast from the side ports threw\r\nthe plane out of the beam--and once out of it, beyond range of the\r\nelectromagnetic detectors as they were their coating of absolute black\r\nrendered the craft safe from observation. One dirigible rocket remained\r\nin action, its exhaust hidden from the enemy by the body of the vessel,\r\nand Captain Czuv soon recovered his senses.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful, gentlemen!\" he exclaimed, as he manipulated the delicate\r\ncontrols of his gunnery panel. \"This is the first time in history that\r\na Callistonian vessel has escaped from a hexan by speed alone.\"\r\n\r\nAn instantaneously extinguished flare of incandescence marked the\r\npassing of the hexan sphere into nothingness, and the cruiser shot back\r\ntoward Callisto in search of more prey. It was all too plentiful, and\r\ntwenty times the drama was reenacted before approaching day made it\r\nnecessary for Czuv to take the controls and dive the vessel into the\r\nwestermost landing-shaft of Zbardk. A rousing and enthusiastic welcome\r\nawaited them, and joy spread rapidly when their success became known.\r\n\r\n\"Now we know what to do, and we had better do it immediately, before\r\nthey get our system figured out and increase their own power.\" King\r\nreported to the Council. \"You might send a couple of ships to Europa and\r\nbring back as many of the Tellurian officers as want to come and can be\r\nspared from the work there. They all test above forty-five meters, and\r\nthey can learn this stuff in short order. While they're coming, your\r\nengineers can be building more ships like this one.\"\r\n\r\nThe new vessel did not make another voyage until nine sister ships\r\nwere ready and manned, each with two Terrestrial officers and one\r\nCallistonian gunner. All ten took to the ether at once, and the hexan\r\nfleet melted away like frost-crystals before a summer sun. A few weeks\r\nof carnage and destruction and not a hexan was within range of the\r\ndetectors of Callisto--they were gone!\r\n\r\n\"This is the first time in years that Callisto's air has been free of\r\nthe hexans,\" Czuv said, thoughtfully. \"With your help we have reduced\r\ntheir strength to a fraction of what it was, but they have not given up.\r\nThey will return, with a higher acceleration than even you Terrestrials,\r\npowerful as you are, can stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly they will, but you will be no worse off than you were\r\nbefore--you can return to your own highly effective tactics.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are infinitely better off for your help. You have given us a new\r\nlease on life....\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off as a flaring light sprang into being upon the portal board\r\nand the observer of Exit One made his report--there was a hexan vessel\r\nin the air, location 425 over VJ-42.\r\n\r\n\"There's one left! Let us get him! No, he's ours!\" Confused shouts arose\r\nfrom the bull-pen; but the original superplane was at the top of the\r\ncall-board and accordingly King, Breckenridge, and Czuv embarked upon\r\nan expedition more hazardous far than they had supposed--an expedition\r\nwhose every feature was relayed to those in the portal by the automatic\r\nlookouts upon the rims and which was ended before a single supporting\r\nCallistonian plane could be launched.\r\n\r\nFor the enemy vessel was not the last of the low-powered hexan vessels,\r\nas everyone had supposed--it was the first of the high-powered craft,\r\narriving long before its appearance was expected. Before its terrific\r\nacceleration and savage onslaught, the superplane might as well have\r\nbeen stationary and unarmed. After his long dive downward, King could\r\nnot even leave the atmosphere--the hexan was upon them within a few\r\nseconds, even though the stupendous battery of rockets, full driven,\r\nhad roared almost instantly into desperate action. Bomb after bomb\r\nBreckenridge hurled, with full radio control, fighting with every\r\nresource at his command, but in vain. The frightful torpedoes were\r\nannihilated in mid-flight; and nose, tail-assembly, and wings were\r\nsheared neatly from the warplane by a sizzling plane of force. Side\r\nrockets and torpedo tubes were likewise sliced away and the helpless\r\nbody of the Callistonian cruiser, falling like a plummet, was caught and\r\nheld by a tractor ray. Captor and captive settled toward the ground.\r\n\r\n\"This is a signal honor,\" observed Captain Czuv when he had revived. \"It\r\nhas been many, many cycles since they have taken Callistonians captive.\r\nThey kill us at every opportunity. Is it your custom to destroy\r\nyourselves in a situation such as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not. While we live there is hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not ours. Unless they have made enormous strides in psychological\r\nmechanisms, they cannot tear from our minds any secrets we really wish\r\nto keep. That is useless,\" he went on, as King lifted a hand-weapon.\r\n\"You will have no opportunity whatever to use it,\" and he was right.\r\n\r\nA searing beam of energy drove them out of the vessel, then\r\nelectromagnetic waves burned every metallic object out of their\r\npossession. Burning rays herded them into the hexan sphere and into\r\na small room, whose door clanged shut behind them.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, two are humans of a strange breed!\" a snarling voice barked\r\nfrom the wall, in the Callistonian language. \"Our deductions were\r\naccurate, as usual--it is to the humans of Planet Three, whose bodies\r\nare a trifle less puny than those of the humanity of the satellites,\r\nthat we owe our recent reverses. However, those reverses were merely\r\ntemporary--humanity, no matter what its breed, shall very shortly\r\ndisappear from the satellites. Now, you scum of the Solar System, you\r\nshall be permitted to witness an entrancing spectacle on the way to our\r\nheadquarters, where all your knowledge is to be taken from you before\r\nyou die, lingeringly and horribly. There is a strange space-vessel\r\nnearing us probably searching for the one we took and which you dogs of\r\nCallisto must have been fortunate enough to take from us before we could\r\nstudy and kill its human cargo. Watch its destruction and cringe--and\r\nknow, in your suffering, that the more you suffer, the greater shall be\r\nour enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that,\" King acknowledged. As all three prisoners stared at\r\nthe wall-screen, upon which was pictured a huge football of scarred grey\r\nsteel, Czuv was amazed to see the faces of Breckenridge and King light\r\nup with fierce smiles of pleasure and anticipation.\r\n\r\n\"You dissemble well,\" remarked the Callistonian. \"That will rob them of\r\nmuch pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll get robbed of more than that,\" King returned. \"This is too\r\ngood to keep, and since they cannot understand English, I'll tell you\r\nsomething. I told you about Stevens. He apparently wasn't killed, as\r\nwe thought. He must have escaped, and there is the result. That ship\r\nthere is far from innocent--her being so far out of range of any of our\r\npower-plants proves that. That vessel is the _Sirius_--the research\r\nlaboratory of the IPC--the Inter-Planetary Corporation! It carries the\r\ngreatest scientific minds of three of the inner planets, and it is\r\nloaded with pure poison or it wouldn't be here. Oh, you hexans, what you\r\nhave got coming to you!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding a Thrilling New Serial of Interplanetary Life and Travel by\r\nEdward E. Smith, Ph.D._\r\n\r\n_Author of \"Skylark of Space,\" and \"Skylark Three\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nSpacehounds of IPC\r\n\r\n    _The question of rays--their expanding power for good and evil--is\r\n    receiving increasing attention from scientists. The x-ray has been\r\n    found to be very beneficial, given in certain quantities, but\r\n    extremely inimical to health, and even fatal, if too much exposure\r\n    is given. The powers of the cosmic rays have not been fully\r\n    discovered as yet. And there is no reason to doubt the theory that\r\n    there may be found still more destructive and powerful rays. Even\r\n    wars are becoming a more dangerous plaything for nations of our\r\n    world--to say nothing of other possible enemies from other parts\r\n    of our universe. Stevens and Nadia Newton meet with thrilling\r\n    experiences galore in this concluding instalment._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Went Before:\r\n\r\n    The Interplanetary Vessel _Arcturus_ sets out for Mars, with\r\n    Breckenridge as chief pilot, carrying on board, besides its\r\n    regular crew and some passengers, the famous Dr. Stevens,\r\n    designer of space ships and computer. He checks computations\r\n    made by astronomers stationed in floating observatories, and\r\n    after he has located any trouble and suggests a plan for\r\n    minimizing the hazards of the trip from the earth to Mars he\r\n    reports his findings and suggestions to Mr. Newton, chief of\r\n    the Interplanetary Corporation.\r\n\r\n    Stevens then takes Nadia, Mr. Newton's beautiful young daughter,\r\n    on a specially conducted sight-seeing tour of the _Arcturus_\r\n    and thoroughly explains to her all of the works of the vessel.\r\n    Nadia has herself had a good science education. While they\r\n    are down at the bottom of the ship--nearing the end of their\r\n    tour--Stevens feels a barely perceptible movement of the vessel\r\n    from its course. When he turns on the visiplate, he is horrified\r\n    to find that a mysterious ray of unparalleled power has neatly\r\n    sliced the _Arcturus_ in several places.\r\n\r\n    Nadia and Stevens are completely separated from the rest of the\r\n    crew and passengers of the ship, so they get into a lifeboat,\r\n    which is equipped for a limited amount of space travel. Despite\r\n    the strict and apparently effective vigilance of the enemy\r\n    destroyer, Stevens and Nadia make their getaway in the lifeboat,\r\n    which they aptly call \"Forlorn Hope,\" and finally make a safe\r\n    landing on Ganymede, where Stevens almost completes a power-plant\r\n    and a radio transmitter, to enable him to communicate with the\r\n    earth or with the IPV _Sirius_, which is used by Westfall and\r\n    Brandon (two of the world's best scientists) as a floating\r\n    laboratory.\r\n\r\n    They start for Cantrell's Comet, where Stevens acquires the\r\n    necessary material for his giant transmitting tube, heads back\r\n    to Ganymede, when their ship is cut, top and bottom, by a strong\r\n    ray-beam. Stevens and Nadia soon find that the other ship is\r\n    manned by friendly beings from Saturn. Together they plan against\r\n    their common foes--the Hexans--who are enemies of the universe.\r\n    After helping the Saturnians to repair their power plant, they\r\n    start back to Ganymede, aided by their new friends from the\r\n    frigid civilization. Finally, however, Stevens succeeds in\r\n    connecting, by radio, with the _Sirius_ and his scientist friends\r\n    on board it, who rush to the aid of the two castaways. It is\r\n    while the castaways are captives of the Hexans that help looms\r\n    near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe _Sirius_ Takes a Hand\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Sirius_ loafed along through the ether at normal acceleration\r\njust outside the orbit of Mars and a million miles north of the\r\necliptic plane. In the control room, which had been transformed into a\r\nbewilderingly complete laboratory, Norman Brandon strode up and down,\r\nwaving his arms, his unruly black hair on end, addressing savagely his\r\nfriend and fellow-scientist, who sat unmoved and at ease.\r\n\r\n\"For cat's sake, Quince, let's get busy! They're outside somewhere,\r\nsince the police have scoured every cubic kilometer within range of\r\nthe power plants without finding a trace of them. We've got the power\r\nquestion licked right now--with these fields we can draw sixty thousand\r\nkilofranks from cosmic radiation, which is lots more than we'll ever\r\nneed. We haven't drawn a frank from a plant in a month, and we've had to\r\ncut our field strength down to a whisper to keep from burning out our\r\naccumulators. We can hunt as far as Neptune easy--we can go to Alpha\r\nCentauri if we want to. This thing of piffling and monkeying around\r\nhere's pulling my cork, and for the ten thousand four hundred and sixty\r\nseventh time I say _let's prowl_ and _prowl now_! In fact, I'm getting\r\nso sick of sticking around doing nothing that I'm going out anyway, if\r\nI have to go alone in a lifeboat!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The flying fortresses were finally wrenched from the\r\nground and hurled upward._]\r\n\r\nImpetuous and violent as Brandon had always been, never before had he\r\ngone to such lengths as to suggest a disruption of the partnership;\r\nand Westfall, knowing that Brandon, in his most violent moments, never\r\nthreatened idly, thought long before he replied.\r\n\r\n\"You will not go alone, of course. If you insist upon going without\r\nfurther preparation I will go too, no matter how foolish I think such\r\na course to be. We have power, it is true, but in all other respects we\r\nare in no condition to meet an opponent having command of such resources\r\nas must certainly be possessed by those who attacked the _Arcturus_.\r\nOur detectors are inefficient, our system of vision is crude, to say\r\nthe least, and many other things are still in the experimental stage.\r\nWe have not the slightest idea whom or what we may encounter. It is all\r\ntoo probable that we would simply be throwing away uselessly the lives of\r\nmore good men. It is also foolish from a general viewpoint, for as you\r\nalready know, we and our assistants happen to be in better position to\r\nstudy these things than is any one else at the present time. However,\r\nI will compromise with you. We can learn much in a month if you will\r\nreally try, instead of wasting time in fuming around the ship and\r\nindulging in these idiotic tantrums. If you will buckle down and really\r\nstudy the problems confronting us for thirty days, we will set out at\r\nthe end of that time, ready or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x. I hate to do it, but we've been together too long to bust it\r\nup now,\" and Brandon turned toward his bench. Scarcely had he reached\r\nit when a series of dots and dashes roared from an amplifier. Both men\r\nleaped for the receiver which had so unexpectedly burst into sound,\r\nreaching it just as it relapsed into silence, and from the tape of the\r\nrecorder they read the brief message.\r\n\r\n\"...h four seven ganymede point oh four seve....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's Steve!\" yelled Brandon. \"Nobody else could build an\r\nultra-sender! Direction?\"\r\n\r\n\"No need of calculating distance or direction. Ganymede is the third\r\nmajor satellite of Jupiter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Of course, Quince--never thought of that. Dope enough--point oh\r\nfour seven.\"\r\n\r\nAs Stevens had told Nadia, the message was completely informing to those\r\nfor whom it was intended, and soon Brandon's answer was flying toward\r\nthe distant satellite. He then started to call the officers of the\r\nInterplanetary Corporation, but was restrained by his conservative\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n\"It would be better to wait a while, Norman. In a few hours we will know\r\nwhat to tell them.\"\r\n\r\nAt high acceleration the _Sirius_ drove toward the Jupiter-Earth-North\r\nplane, and Brandon calculated from his own bearings and from the current\r\nissue of the \"Ephemeris\" the time at which Stevens' reply should be\r\nreceived. Two minutes before that time he was pacing up and down in\r\nfront of the ultra-receiver, and fifteen seconds after it he snapped:\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Perce, get busy! Shake a leg!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, Norman; give him a few minutes' leeway, at least,\" said\r\nWestfall, with amused tolerance. \"Even if your calculations are that\r\naccurate--which of course they are,\" he added hastily at a stormy glance\r\nfrom hot black eyes, \"since we received that message direct, instead of\r\nthrough one of our relay stations, Stevens probably has been throwing\r\nit around for hours or perhaps days, looking for us, and the shock of\r\nhearing from us at last might well have put him out of control for a\r\nminute or two.\"\r\n\r\nThe carrier wave hissed into the receiver, forestalling Brandon's fiery\r\nreply, followed closely by the code signals they had been expecting. As\r\nsoon as the story had been told, and while Brandon was absorbed in the\r\nscientific addenda of Stevens, Westfall thoughtfully called up Newton,\r\nNadia's father.\r\n\r\n\"Nadia is alive, free, safe, well, and happy,\" he shot out without\r\npreliminary or greeting, as soon as the now lined features of the\r\ndirector showed upon the communicator screen, and the careworn\r\ncountenance smoothed magically into the keen face of the fighting Newton\r\nof old, as Westfall recounted rapidly the tale of the castaways.\r\n\r\n\"They apparently have not suffered in any way,\" he concluded. \"All that\r\nStevens wants is some cigarettes, and your daughter's needs, while\r\nsomewhat more numerous than his, seem to be only clothes, powder,\r\nperfume, and candy. Therefore we need not worry about them. The fate of\r\nthe others is still unknown, but there seems to be a slight possibility\r\nthat some of them may yet be rescued. You may release as much or as\r\nlittle of this story as may seem desirable. Stevens is still sending\r\ndata of a highly technical nature. We shall arrive there at 21:32 next\r\nTuesday.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn due time the message from Ganymede ended and Brandon, with many pages\r\nof his notebook crammed with figures and equations, snapped off the\r\npower of the receiver and turned to his bench. Gone was the storming,\r\nimpetuous rebel; his body was ruled solely by the precise and insatiable\r\nbrain of the research scientist.\r\n\r\n\"He's great, that kid Perce! When I see him, I'm going to kiss him\r\non both cheeks. He's got enough dope on them to hang them higher than\r\nFranklin's kite, and we'll nail those jaspers to the cross or I'm a\r\npolyp! He's crazier than a loon in most of his hunches, but he's filled\r\nfour of our biggest gaps. There is such a thing, as a ray-screen, you\r\nkill-joy, and there are also lifting or tractor rays--two things I've\r\nbeen trying to dope out and that you've been giving me the Bronx cheer\r\non. The Titanians have had a tractor ray for ages--he sent me complete\r\ndope on it--and the Jovians have got them both. We'll have them in three\r\ndays, and it ought to be fairly simple to dope out the opposite of a\r\ntractor, too--a pusher or presser beam. Say, round up the gang, will\r\nyou, while I'm licking some of this stuff into shape for you to tear\r\napart? Where are Venus and Mars? Um ... m ... m. Tell Alcantro and\r\nFedanzo to come over here pronto--give 'em a special if necessary. We'll\r\npick up Dol Kenor and Pyraz Amonar on the way--no, get them to Tellus,\r\ntoo. Then we'll get action quicker. Those four are all I want--get\r\nanybody else you want to come along.\"\r\n\r\nHis hands playing over the keys of an enormous calculating machine,\r\nBrandon was instantly immersed in a profound mathematico-physical\r\nproblem; deaf and blind to everything about him. Westfall, knowing well\r\nthat far-reaching results would follow Brandon's characteristic attack,\r\nsat down at the controls of the communicator. He first called Mars, the\r\nhome planet of Alcantro and Fedanzo, the foremost force-field experts of\r\nthree planets; and was assured in no uncertain terms that those rulers\r\nof rays were ready and anxious to follow wherever Brandon and Westfall\r\nmight lead. Thence to Venus, where Dol Kenor, the electrical wizard,\r\nand Pyraz Amonar, the master of mechanism, also readily agreed to\r\naccompany the expedition. He then called the General-in-Chief of the\r\nInterplanetary Police, requesting a detail of two hundred picked men\r\nfor the hazardous venture. These most important calls out of the way,\r\nhe was busy for over an hour giving long-distance instructions so that\r\neverything would be in readiness for the servicing of the immense\r\nspace-cruiser the following Tuesday night.\r\n\r\nHaving guarded against everything his cautious and far-seeing mind\r\ncould envisage, he went over to Brandon's desk and sat down, smoking\r\ncontemplatively until the idea had been roughed out in mathematical\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the rough draft of the ray screen, Quince. We generate a blanket\r\nfrequency, impressed upon the ultra carrier wave. That's old stuff, of\r\ncourse. Here's the novelty, in equation 59. With two fields of force,\r\nset up from data 27 to 43, it will be possible actually to project a\r\npure force of such a nature that it will react to de-heterodyne the\r\nblanketing frequency at any predetermined distance. That, of course,\r\nsets up a barrier against any frequency of the blanketed band.\r\nIncidentally, an extension of the same idea will enable us to see\r\nanywhere we want to look--calculate a retransmitting field.\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing at a time, please. That screen may be possible, but\r\nthose fields will never generate it. Look at datum 31, in which your\r\nassumptions are unsound. In order to make any solution at all possible\r\nyou have assumed cosine squared theta negligible. Mathematically, it is\r\nof course vanishingly small compared to the first power of the cosine,\r\nbut fields of that type must be _exact_, and your neglect of the square\r\nis indefensible. Since you cannot integrate with the squared term in\r\nplace, your whole solution fails.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily. We'll go back to 29, and put in sine squared theta\r\nminus one equal to z sub four. That gives us a coversed sine in 30,\r\nand then we integrate....\"\r\n\r\nThus the argument raged, and all the assistants whose work was not\r\ntoo pressing gathered around unobtrusively, for it was from just such\r\nfierce discussions as this that the ultra-radio and other epoch-making\r\ndiscoveries had come into being. Yard after yard of calculator paper\r\nwas filled with equations and computations. Weirdly shaped curves\r\nwere drawn, with arguments at every point--arguments hot and violent\r\nfrom Brandon, from Westfall cold and precise, backed by lightning\r\ncalculations and with facts and diagrams culled from the many abstruse\r\nworks of reference, which by this time literally covered the bench and\r\noverflowed upon the floor.\r\n\r\nIt was in this work that the strikingly different temperaments and\r\nabilities of the two scientists were revealed. Brandon never stood\r\nstill, but walked around jerkily, chewing savagely the stem of an\r\nancient and reeking pipe, gesticulating vigorously, the while his keen\r\nand agile mind was finding a way over, around, or through the apparently\r\ninsuperable obstacles which beset their path; by means of mathematical\r\nand physical improvisations, which no one not inspired by sheer genius\r\ncould have evolved. Westfall, seated quietly at the calculator,\r\nmercilessly shredded Brandon's theories to ribbons, pointing out their\r\nmany flaws with his cold, incisive reasoning and with rapid calculations\r\nof the many factors involved. Then Brandon would find a remedy for each\r\nweakness in turn and, when Westfall could no longer find a single flaw\r\nin the structure, they would toss the completed problem upon a table\r\nand attack the next one with unabated zeal. Brandon, in his light\r\nremark that the two made one real scientist, had far understated\r\nthe case--those two brains, each so powerful and each so perfectly\r\ncomplementing the other, comprised the master-scientist who was to\r\nrevolutionize science completely in a few short years.\r\n\r\nTo such good purpose did they labor that the calculations were\r\npractically finished by the time they reached the earth. There the ship\r\nwas serviced with a celerity that spoke volumes for the importance of\r\nher mission--even the _Aldebaran_, the dazzlingly gold-plated queen of\r\nthe fleet, waited unattended and disregarded on minus time while the\r\nentire force of the Interplanetary Corporation concentrated upon the\r\nbattle-scarred old hulk of the _Sirius_. Brandon was surprised when he\r\nsaw the two companies of police, but characteristically accepted without\r\nquestion the wisdom of any decision of his friend, and cordially greeted\r\nInspector-General Crowninshield, only a year or so older than himself,\r\nbut already in charge of a Division.\r\n\r\n\"Keen-looking bunch, Crown. Lot of different outfits--volunteers for\r\nspecial duty from the whole Tellurian force?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Everybody wanted to go, and there threatened to be trouble over\r\nthe selection, so we picked the highest ratings from the whole Service.\r\nIf there ever was such a thing as a picked force, we shall have it\r\nwith us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What d'you mean, 'us'? You aren't going, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Try to keep me from it! The names of all five of us I-G's were put in\r\na hat, and I was lucky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you may come in handy, at that,\" Brandon conceded. \"And here's\r\nthe big boss himself. Hi, Chief!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, Brandon! Ho, Westfall!\" Newton, Chairman of the Board of Directors\r\nof the IPC, shook hands with the two scientists. \"Your Martians and\r\nVenerians are in Lounge Fifteen. I suppose that you have a lot of things\r\nto thrash out, so you may as well start now. Everything is being\r\nattended to--I'll take charge now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You going along, too?\" asked Brandon.\r\n\r\n\"Going along, _too_? I'm _running_ this cruise!\" Newton declared. \"I may\r\ntake advice from you on some things and from Crowninshield on others,\r\nbut I am in charge!\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--it's a relief, at that,\" and Brandon and Westfall went to join\r\ntheir fellow-scientists in the designated room of the space-cruiser.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast was there as the representatives of three worlds\r\nmet! All six men were of the same original stock or of a similar\r\nevolution--science has not, even yet, decided the question definitely.\r\nTheir minds were very much alike, but their respective environments had\r\nso variantly developed their bodily structures that to outward seeming\r\nthey had but little in common.\r\n\r\nThrough countless thousands of generations the Martians had become\r\nacclimated to a planet having little air, less water, and characterized\r\nby abrupt transitions from searing heat to bitter cold: from\r\nblinding light to almost impenetrable darkness. Eight feet tall\r\nand correspondingly massive, they could barely stand against the\r\ngravitational force of the Earth, almost three times as great as that\r\nof Mars, but the two Martian scientists struggled to their feet as the\r\nTerrestrials entered.\r\n\r\n\"As you were, fellows--lie down again and take it easy.\" Brandon\r\nsuggested in the common Interplanetarian tongue. \"We'll be away from\r\nhere very soon, then we can ease off.\"\r\n\r\n\"We greet our friends standing as long as we can stand,\" and, towering\r\na full two feet above Brandon's own six-feet-two, Alcantro and Fedanzo\r\nin turn engulfed his comparatively tiny hand in a thick-shelled paw\r\nand lifted briefly the inner lids of quadruply-shielded eyes. For the\r\nMartian skin is not like ours. It is of incredible thickness; dry,\r\npliable, rubbery, and utterly without sensation: heavily lined with\r\nfat and filled throughout its volume with tiny air-cells which make\r\nit an almost perfect non-conductor of heat and which prevent absolutely\r\nthe evaporation of the precious moisture of the body. For the same\r\nreasons their huge and cat-like eyes are never exposed, but look\r\nthrough sealed, clear windows of membrane, over which may be drawn at\r\nwill one or all of four pairs of lids--lids transparent, insensible,\r\nnon-freezable, air-spaced insulators. Even the air they exhale carries\r\nfrom their bodies a minimum of the all-important heat and moisture,\r\nfor the passages of their nostrils do not lead directly to the lungs,\r\nas do ours. They are merely the intakes for a tortuous system of\r\ntubes comprising a veritable heat-exchanger, so that the air finally\r\nexpelled is in almost perfect equilibrium with the incoming supply\r\nin temperature and in moisture content. A grayish tan in color, naked\r\nand hairless--though now, out of deference to Terrestrial conventions,\r\nwearing light robes of silk--indifferent alike to any extreme of heat or\r\ncold, light or darkness: such were the two forbidding beings who arose\r\nto greet their Terrestrial friends, then again reclined.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that you have been given to drink?\" Westfall made sure that\r\nthey had been tendered the highest hospitality of Mars.\r\n\r\n\"We have drunk full deeply, thanks; and it was not really necessary,\r\nfor we drank scarcely three weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\nBrandon and Westfall turned then and greeted the two Venerians,\r\nas different from the Martians as they were from the Terrestrials.\r\nOf earthly stature, form, and strength, yet each was encased in a\r\nspace-suit stretched like a drum-head, and would live therein or in\r\nthe special Venerian rooms of the vessel as long as the journey should\r\nendure. For the atmosphere of Venus is more than twice as dense as ours,\r\nis practically saturated with water-vapor, carries an extremely high\r\nconcentration of carbon dioxide, and in their suits and rooms is held\r\nat a temperature of one hundred and ten degrees Fahrenheit. The lenses\r\nof their helmets were of heavy, yellowish-red composition, protecting\r\ntheir dead-white skins and red eyes from all actinic rays--for the\r\nVenerian lives upon the bottom of an everlasting sea of fog and his\r\nthin epidermis, utterly without pigmentation, burns and blisters as\r\nfrightfully at the least exposure to actinic light as does ours at\r\nthe touch of a red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nOut in space at last, cruising idly with the acceleration set at a point\r\nbearable for the Martians, Westfall called the meeting to order and\r\noutlined the situation facing them. Brandon then handed around folios of\r\npapers, upon which the Venerians turned the invisible infra-red beams of\r\nthe illuminators upon their helmets, thus flooding them with the \"light\"\r\nto which their retinas were most responsive.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the data,\" Brandon began. \"As you see from Sheet 1, we can\r\nalready draw any amount of power we shall need from cosmic radiation\r\nalone....\"\r\n\r\n\"Perpetual motion--ridiculous!\" snapped from the sending disk upon the\r\nhelmet of the master of mechanism.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, Amonar,\" put in his fellow Venerian, \"any more than\r\na turbo-generator at the foot of a waterfall is perpetual motion.\r\nThose radiations originate we know not where, probably as a result\r\nof intra-atomic reactions. The fields of force of our hosts merely\r\nintercept these radiations, as a water-driven turbine intercepts the\r\nwater. We merely use a portion of their energy before permitting\r\nthem to go on, to we know not what end. Truly you have made a notable\r\nachievement in science, Tellurian friends, and we congratulate you upon\r\nits accomplishment. Please proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon the following sheets are described the forces employed by the\r\nJovians, as we shall call them until we find out who or what they really\r\nare. We will discuss these forces later. For each force we have already\r\ncalculated a screen, and we have also calculated various other forces of\r\nour own, with which we hope to arm ourselves before we reach Ganymede.\r\nThe problems facing us are complex, since there are some nine thousand\r\nforcebands of the order in which we are working, each differing from all\r\nthe others as much as torque differs from tension, or as much as red\r\ndiffers from green. Therefore we have appealed to you for help, knowing\r\nthat we could do but little alone. Alcantro and Fedanzo will supervise\r\nthe construction of the generators of the various fields from these\r\ncalculations. Dol Kenor will correlate power and electricity to and\r\nwith the fields. Westfall and I will help work out the theoretical\r\ndifficulties as they arise. Pyraz Amonar, who can devise and build a\r\nmachine to perform any conceivable mechanical task, will help us all\r\nin the many mechanical difficulties we shall certainly encounter.\r\nDiscussion of any point is now in order.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStep by step and equation after equation the calculations and plans\r\nwere gone over, until every detail was clear in each mind. Then the men\r\nbent to their tasks; behind them not only the extraordinarily complete\r\nfacilities of that gigantic workshop which was the _Sirius_; but also\r\nthe full power of the detachment of police--the very cream of the young\r\nmanhood of the planet. Week after toilsome week the unremitting labor\r\nwent on, and little by little the massive cruiser of the void became\r\nendowed with an offensive and defensive armament incredible. An armament\r\nconceived in the fertile and daring brain of a sheer genius, guided only\r\nby the knowledge that such things were already in existence somewhere;\r\nreduced to working theory by a precise, mathematical logician;\r\ntranslated into fields of force by the greatest known experts; powered\r\nby the indefatigable efforts of an electrical wizard; made possible by\r\nthe artful mechanical devices of the greatest inventor that three worlds\r\nhad ever known! Thus it was that they approached Ganymede, ready, with\r\nblanketing screens full out, save for one narrow working band, and\r\nwith a keen-eyed observer at every plate. When even the hyper-critical\r\nWestfall was convinced that their preparations were as complete as they\r\ncould be made with the limited information at hand, Brandon directed a\r\nbeam upon the satellite and tapped off a brief message:\r\n\r\n\"stevens ganymede will arrive in about ten hours direct carrier beam\r\ntoward sun we can detect it and will follow it to wherever you are\r\nsirius.\"\r\n\r\n\"ipv sirius,\" came the reply, \"everything here, all x glad to see you\r\nthanks newton and stevens.\"\r\n\r\nBrandon, at the controls, scanning his screens narrowly, dropped the\r\nvessel down to within a mile or two of the point of origin of Stevens'\r\ncarrier beam without incident; then spoke to Westfall, at his side, with\r\na grin.\r\n\r\n\"Nice layout the kid's got down there, Quince. It's too bad--don't look\r\nlike we're going to get any action for our money a-tall. 'Sa shame,\r\ntoo--what's the use of wasting it, now that we've got it all made?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not done yet,\" cautioned Westfall, and even as he spoke an alarm\r\nbell burst into strident clamor--one of their far-flung detector screens\r\nwas telling the world that it had encountered a dangerous frequency.\r\nThe new ultra-lights flared instantly along the line automatically laid\r\ndown by the detector, and upon the closely ruled micrometer screen of\r\nBrandon's desk there glowed in natural color the image of a globular\r\nspace-ship, approaching them with terrific speed.\r\n\r\n\"Men all stationed, of course, Crown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stationed and ready.\" Crowninshield, phones at his ears and microphone\r\nat his lips, was staring intently into his own plate.\r\n\r\n\"Kinda think I'll do most of it from here, but you can't always tell. If\r\nthey get inside my guard you all know what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x.\"\r\n\r\nExpecting another such hollow victory as the other Hexan vessel had won\r\nover the defenseless _Arcturus_, the small stranger flashed nearer and\r\nnearer that huge and featureless football of armor steel. Within range,\r\nshe launched her flaming plane of energy, but this time that Jovian\r\nsheet of force did not encounter unprotected and non-resisting steel.\r\nUpon the outer ray-screen, flaming white into incandescent defense,\r\nthe furious bolt spent itself, and in the instant of the launching of\r\nthe searing blade of flame, Brandon had gone into action. Switch after\r\nswitch drove home, and one after another those frightful fields of\r\nforce, those products of the mightiest minds of three planets, were\r\nhurled out against the tiny Jovian sphere. Driven as they were by the\r\nmillions upon millions of horsepower stored in the accumulators of the\r\n_Sirius_ they formed a coruscating spherical shell of intolerable energy\r\nall around the enemy vessel, but even their prodigious force was held\r\nat bay by the powerful defensive screens of the smaller space-ship.\r\nBut attack the Jovian could not, every resource at her command being\r\nnecessary to fend off the terrific counter-attack of her intended prey,\r\nand she turned in flight. Small and agile as she was, the enormous\r\nmass of the _Sirius_ precluded any possibility of maneuvering with\r\nthe Jovian, but Brandon had no intention of maneuvering. Rapid as\r\nthe motions of the stranger were and frantic as was her dodging, the\r\nterrific forces of the tractor beams of the Interplanetary Vessel\r\nheld her in an unbreakable grip, and although she dragged the massive\r\n_Sirius_ hither and thither, she could not escape.\r\n\r\n\"Hm ... m ... m,\" mused Brandon. \"We seem to be getting nowhere fast.\r\nHow much power we using, Mac, and how much have we got coming in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Output eighty-five thousand kilofranks,\" replied MacDonald, the first\r\nassistant. \"Intake forty-nine thousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so good--can't hold out forever at that rate. Shove out the\r\nreceptor screens to the limit and drive 'em. They figure a top of sixty\r\nthousand, but we ought to pick up a little extra from that blaze out\r\nthere. Drive 'em full out or up to sixty-five, whichever comes first.\r\nCan't seem to crush his screens, so I guess we'll have to try something\r\nelse,\" and a thoughtful expression came over his face as he slowly\r\nextended his hand toward another switch, with a questioning glance at\r\nWestfall.\r\n\r\n\"Better not do that yet, Norman. Use that only as a last resort, after\r\neverything else has failed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah--I'm scared to death of trying it, and it isn't necessary yet. He\r\nmust have an open slit somewhere to work through, just as we have. I'll\r\nfeel around for it a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any way of hetrodyning the new visiray upon the exploring\r\nfrequency?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hm ... m.... Never thought of that--it would be nice, too....\r\nI think we can do it, too. Watch 'em, Quince, and holler if they start\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nHe abandoned his desk and established the necessary connections between\r\nthe visiray apparatus and the controls of his board. There was a fierce\r\nviolet-white glare from the plate as he closed the switch, and he leaped\r\nback with his hands over his eyes, temporarily blinded.\r\n\r\n\"Wow, that's hot stuff!\" he exclaimed. \"It works, all x, to the queen's\r\ntaste,\" as he donned his heavy ray-goggles and resumed his place.\r\n\r\nAfter making certain that the visiray was precisely synchronized and\r\nphased with the searching frequency, he built up the power of that\r\nbeam until it was using twenty thousand kilofranks. Then, by delicately\r\nmanipulating the variable condensers and inductances of his sensitive\r\nshunting relay circuits, he slowly shifted that frightful rod of energy\r\nfrom frequency to frequency, staring into the brilliant blankness of his\r\nmicrometer screen as he did so. After a few minutes of search the screen\r\ndarkened somewhat, revealing the image of the Jovian globe. Brandon\r\ninstantly shifted into that one channel the entire power of his attack;\r\nsteadying the controls to bring the sphere of the Jovians into the\r\nsharpest possible focus, knowing that he had found the open slit and\r\nthat through it there was pouring upon the enemy the full power of his\r\nterrible weapon.\r\n\r\nIn the fraction of a second before the Jovians could detect the attack\r\nand close the slit, he saw a portion of the wall of their vessel flare\r\ninto white heat and literally explode outward in puffs and gouts of\r\nflaming, molten metal and of incandescent gases. But the thrust, savage\r\nas it was, had not been fatal and the enemy countered instantly. Now\r\nthat the crushing force of the full-coverage attack was lessened for a\r\nmoment, through another slit there poured a beam of energy equal to the\r\nTerrestrials' own--a beam of such intense power that the outer screen\r\nof the _Sirius_ flared from red through the spectrum, to and beyond the\r\nviolet, and went black in less than a second, and the inner screen had\r\nalmost gone down before Brandon's lightning hands could restore the\r\ncomplete coverage that so effectively blanketed the forces of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're back to the _status quo_,\" announced Brandon, calmly. \"It's\r\na good gag they didn't have time to locate our working slit--if they had\r\npushed that stuff through our open channel, we'd have gotten frizzled up\r\nsome around the edges. As it was, we got the edge on that exchange--take\r\nit from your Uncle Dudley, Quince, that bird knows that he's been\r\nnudged!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain he searched the entire band for an opening, but could find none.\r\nThe enemy had apparently retired into a tightly closed shell of energy.\r\nThe small vessel no longer struggled, nor even moved, but was merely\r\nresisting passively.\r\n\r\n\"Not an open channel, not even one for him to work through--he can't\r\nwiggle. Well, that won't get him anything. We're so much bigger than\r\nhe is, that we can outlast him and will get him some time, since he's\r\nbound to run out of power before we do. I don't believe he can receive\r\nanything, sealed up as he is, and he can't have accumulators enough more\r\nefficient than ours to make up the difference, can he, Quince?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite possible. For instance, although we have never heard of any\r\nprogress being made along such lines, it has been pointed out repeatedly\r\nthat synthesis of a radio-active element of very high atomic weight\r\nwould theoretically yield an almost perfect accumulator--one many\r\nthousands of times as efficient as ours in mass-to-energy ratio. Then,\r\ntoo, you realize, of course, that there is a bare possibility that\r\nintra-atomic energy may not be absolutely impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nix on that, Quince. I'll stand for a lot, but not for that last idea!\r\nIt's hard to say that anything's impossible, of course, except things\r\nmade so by definition or by being contrary to observational facts, but\r\nthe best work shows that intra-atomic energy is just about as impossible\r\nas anything can well be. It has been shown pretty conclusively that all\r\nordinary matter is already in its most stable state, so that work must\r\nbe done upon any ordinary atom to decompose it. Besides, if he had\r\neither radioactive accumulators or intra-atomic energy, he would have\r\ncut us up long ago. Nope, the answer is that he's probably yelled for\r\nhelp and is trying to hold out until it gets here,\" was Brandon's\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\n\"What can we do about it?\" asked Quince.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know yet. I do know, though, that we aren't half as ready for\r\ntrouble as I thought we were. There's a dozen things I want to do that\r\nI can't because we haven't got the stuff. Don't say 'I told you so,'\r\neither--I know you did! You're the champion ground-and-lofty thinker of\r\nthe century. Alcantro!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here!\"\r\n\r\n\"Round up the gang, will you, and figure me out a screen and a set of\r\nmeters that will indicate an open band? We lose too much time feeling\r\naround anyhow, and we're too apt to take one on the chin while we're\r\ndoing it. Also, you ought to make it so it'll shoot a jolt into the\r\nopening, while you're at it,\" said Brandon.\r\n\r\n\"We shall begin at once,\" and the massive Martian as he replied, stepped\r\nover to the calculating machine.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Quince, we can't do much to him this way--he's crawled into a\r\nhole and pulled the hole in after him. Gosh, I wish we had more stuff!\"\r\n\r\n\"After all, we have everything whose necessity and practicability could\r\nhave been foreseen in the light of our information. We can, of course,\r\ngo further.\"\r\n\r\n\"You chirped it! But we can't let things ride this way or we'll get our\r\nhair singed. We'll have to decorate him with the grand slam, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it seems as though the time for emergency measures has arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put everything on the center of the band?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is probably the best frequency to use in a case of this kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't control, so we'll push him down close to the ground before\r\nwe go to work on him--so we don't have so far to fall if anything goes\r\nscrewy with the works. Here's hoping nothing gives away!\"\r\n\r\nThe _Sirius_, almost against the flaming screens of the Jovian, and both\r\nvessels very close to the surface of the satellite, Brandon tested the\r\npower leads briefly, adjusted dials and coils, then touched the button\r\nwhich actuated the relays--relays which in turn drove home the gigantic\r\nswitches that launched a fearsome and as yet untried weapon. Instantly\r\nreleased, the full seven hundred thousand kilofranks of their stupendous\r\nbatteries of accumulators drove into the middle frequency of the\r\nattacking band, and Brandon's heart was in his mouth as he stared into\r\nthe plate to see what would happen. He saw! Everything in the _Sirius_\r\nheld fast, and under the impact of the inconceivable plane of force, the\r\nscreens of the enemy vessel flared instantly into an even more intense\r\nincandescence and in that same fleeting instant went down, and all\r\ndefenses vanished as the metal sphere fell apart into two halves, as\r\nwould an apple under the full blow of a broad-axe.\r\n\r\nBrandon quickly shut off his power and stared in relief into the central\r\ncompartment of the globular ship of space, now laid open, and saw there\r\nfigures, one or two of which were moving weakly. As he looked, one of\r\nthese feebly attempted to raise a peculiar, tubular something toward a\r\nhelplessly fettered body. Even as Brandon snatched away the threatening\r\nweapon with a beam of force, he recognized the captive.\r\n\r\n\"Great Cat, there's Breckenridge!\" he gasped, and directed a lifting\r\nbeam upon the bound and unconscious prisoner. Rapidly, but carefully, he\r\nwas brought through the double airlock and into the control room, where\r\nhis shackles were cut away and where he soon revived under vigorous and\r\nskilful treatment.\r\n\r\n\"Any more of you in there? Did I hit any of you with that beam?\"\r\ndemanded Brandon, intensely, as soon as Breckenridge showed signs of\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n\"King's in there somewhere, and there's a Callistonian human being that\r\nyou mustn't kill,\" the chief pilot replied, weakly and with great effort\r\nin every word. \"Don't believe that you hit anybody direct, but the shock\r\nwas pretty bad.\" Having delivered his message, he lay back, exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"All x. Crown, give me a squad....\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your life!\" barked the general. \"This is my job and I'll do it\r\nmyself. Your job is fighting the _Sirius_--stay with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in seven thousand years--I'm in on this, too,\" Brandon protested,\r\nbut was decisively overruled by Newton.\r\n\r\n\"You belong right here at this board, since no one else can handle it\r\nthe way you can. Stay here!\" he commanded.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" grudgingly assented the physicist, and held the _Sirius_\r\nupright, with her needle-sharp stern buried a few feet deep in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHe watched the wreckage jealously while Crowninshield and forty helmeted\r\nmen issued from the service door in the lower ultra-light compartment\r\nand advanced upon the two halves of the enemy vessel. As no hostile\r\ndemonstrations ensued, scaling ladders were quickly placed and with\r\nweapons at the alert the police boarded the hemispheres, manacled the\r\nstill helpless beings visible, and, after laying down a fog of\r\nstupefying gas, vanished into compartments beyond the metal partitions.\r\nAfter a short time they reappeared and climbed down the scaling ladders,\r\ncarrying several inert forms, and Brandon spoke into his transmitter.\r\n\r\n\"King all x, Crowninshield?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so. Not being in the control room he was not as badly shocked\r\nby the passage of the beam as were Breckenridge and those you saw. The\r\nthings in the other rooms were about ready to fight, so we gave them a\r\nlittle whiff of tritylamin, but Captain King will be as good as ever in\r\na few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine business!\" The police entered the _Sirius_, the service doors\r\nclanged shut, and Brandon turned to Westfall.\r\n\r\n\"While they're coming up, I guess I'll pick up Perce and Miss Newton.\r\nWe'd better get them aboard and beat it, while we're all in one piece!\"\r\n\r\nBut even before he could send out the exploring beam of his\r\ncommunicator, the voice of Stevens came from the receiver.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Brandon and Westfall! We've watched the whole show.\r\nCongratulations, fellows! Welcome to Ganymede! You are in our\r\nvalley--we're upstream from you about three hundred meters; just below\r\nthe falls, on the meadow side.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x,\" Brandon acknowledged. \"We saw you. Come on out where we can\r\npick you up. We've got to get away from here, and get away fast!\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll carry off the pieces of that ship, too, Quince--we may be able to\r\nget a lot of pointers from it,\" and Brandon swung mighty tractor beams\r\nupon the severed halves of the Jovian vessel, then extended a couple of\r\nsmaller rays to meet the two little figures racing across the smooth\r\ngreen meadow toward the _Sirius_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAmong Friends at Last\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time for the landing of the _Sirius_ was drawing near, and the\r\ncastaways upon Ganymede had donned their only suits of earthly clothing,\r\ninstead of the makeshifts of mole-skin, canvas, and leather they had\r\nbeen wearing so long. Thorns and underbrush had pierced and torn their\r\nonce natty outing costumes, and sparks and flying drops of molten metal\r\nfrom Stevens' first crude forges had burned in them many gaping holes.\r\n\r\n\"I did the best I could with them, Steve, but they look pretty crumby,\"\r\nNadia wrinkled her nose as she studied the anything but invisible seams,\r\ndarns, and staring patches everywhere so evident, both in her own\r\napparel of gray silk and in the heavy whipcord clothing of her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"You did a great job, considering what you had to work with,\" he\r\nreassured her. \"Besides, who cares about a few patches? I feel a lot\r\nmore civilized in my own clothes, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well ... yes,\" she admitted. \"They're silk, anyway, even if they don't\r\nlook like much, and I'm just reveling in the feel of them next to me\r\nafter the horrible, rough, scratchy things I've been wearing. See\r\nanything yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet.\" Stevens had been scanning the heavens with a pair of\r\nbinoculars. \"That doesn't mean much, though, as they'll be just about in\r\nthe sun and they'll be coming like a scared dog. Might as well put away\r\nthese glasses--we probably won't be able to see them until they're right\r\non top of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we take with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know--nothing, probably, since they must have a campaign already\r\nmapped out. I'd like to salvage a lot of this junk, but I'm afraid we\r\nwon't be able to. I'm going to take my bow and arrows, though, aren't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely! That's one thing that's better than anything I ever had on\r\nEarth. This bow of mine is perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"There they are! Three rousing cheers! Say, but that old hulk looks good\r\nto me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't she, though!\" cried Nadia, vibrant with excitement. \"You know,\r\nSteve. I've hardly dared really to believe it until this very minute. Oh\r\nlook! What's that?\"\r\n\r\nThe _Sirius_ had stopped in midair and they could see, far in the\r\ndistance, the tiny sphere of the Jovians, rushing to the attack.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how horrible!\" cried the girl, her voice breaking. \"I'm afraid,\r\nSteve....\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't be, ace. I've told you they won't go off half-cocked as\r\nlong as Westfall is on the job. They're ready for anything, or they\r\nwouldn't be here--but just the same I wish that they had that Titanian\r\nmirror and a couple of those bombs!\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment more the Jovian plane of force was launched, the powerful\r\nray-screens flared into white-hot, sparkling defense, and the battle was\r\non. Held spell-bound as the castaways were by that spectacular duel, yet\r\nStevens' trained mind warned him of the perils of their position.\r\n\r\n\"Grab your bow and we'll beat it!\" and he rapidly led her away from the\r\nsteel structures to an open hillside, well away from any projection,\r\ntree, or sharp point of rock. \"If that keeps up very long, we're going\r\nto see some real fireworks, and I don't know whether there will be\r\nenough left of our plant here to salvage or not. Everything is grounded,\r\nof course, but I don't believe that ordinary grounds will amount to much\r\nagainst what's coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _are_ you talking about?\" demanded Nadia.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he replied, pointing, and as he spoke, a terrific bolt of\r\nlightning launched itself from the incandescent screen of the Jovian\r\nvessel upon their slender ultra-radio tower, which subsided instantly\r\ninto a confused mass of molten and twisted metal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the power of the beams was increased and as the combatants drew\r\nnearer and nearer the ground, the lightning display grew ever more\r\nviolent. Well below the canyon as the warring vessels were, the\r\npower-plant and penstock did not suffer at all and only a few discharges\r\nstruck the _Forlorn Hope_--discharges which were carried easily to\r\nground by the enormous thickness of her armor--but every prominent\r\nobject for hundreds of yards below the _Hope_ was literally blasted out\r\nof existence. Radio tower, directors and fittings; trees, shrubs, sharp\r\npoints of rock--all were struck again and again; fused, destroyed,\r\nutterly obliterated by the inconceivable energy being dissipated by\r\nthose impregnable screens of force. Even almost flat upon the ground as\r\nthe spectators were, each individual hair upon their heads strove\r\nfiercely to stand erect, so heavily charged was the very air. Stevens'\r\narm was blue for days, such was Nadia's grip upon it, and she herself\r\ncould scarcely breathe in that mighty arm's constriction--but each was\r\nconscious only of that incredibly violent struggle, of that duel to the\r\ndeath being waged there before their eyes with those frightful weapons,\r\nhitherto unknown to man. They saw the _Sirius_ triumphant, and Stevens\r\nled the dancing girl back into their dwelling of steel.\r\n\r\n\"Danger's all over now. Radio's gone, but we should fret a lot about\r\nthat. It has done its stuff--we can use the communicators. And now,\r\nsweetheart, I'm going to kiss you--for the first time in seven\r\nlifetimes.\"\r\n\r\nLocked in each other's arms, they watched the scene until Stevens\r\nthought it time to send his message. Then, running hand in hand toward\r\nthe huge space-cruiser, they were snatched apart and drawn up toward the\r\ndouble airlocks of the main entrance. Pressure gradually brought up to\r\nnormal, they were ushered into the control room, where Nadia glanced\r\naround quickly and almost took her father off his feet by her\r\ntempestuous rush into his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Daddy darling. I just knew you'd come along! I haven't seen\r\nyou for a million years!\" she exclaimed, rapturously. \"And Bill,\r\ntoo--wonderful!\" as she fervently embraced a young man wearing the\r\nuniform of a lieutenant of Interplanetary Police. \"Ouch, Bill--you're\r\nbreaking all my ribs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you cracked three of mine. Maybe you don't know how husky you\r\nare, but you've got a squeeze like a full grown boa constrictor!\" He\r\nheld her off at arms' length and studied her with admiration. \"Gee,\r\nit's fine to see you again, Sis. You're looking great, too--I think\r\nI'll bring my girl out here to live. You always were a knockout, but\r\nnow you're the loveliest thing I ever saw!\"\r\n\r\nHe made his way through the group surrounding Stevens, while Nadia and\r\nher father talked earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Bill Newton. Thanks,\" he said, simply, holding out his hand, which\r\nwas taken in a bone-crushing grip.\r\n\r\n\"Bring him over here, Bill!\" Nadia called before Stevens could find\r\na reply.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how to say anything, Stevens,\" the officer continued, in\r\nembarrassment, as the two men turned to obey the summons. \"She's a good\r\nkid, and we think a lot of her. We'd about given her up. We.... She....\r\nOh, rats, what's the use? You know what I mean. You're there, Stevens,\r\nlike a....\"\r\n\r\n\"Clam it, ace!\" Stevens interrupted. \"I get you, to nineteen decimals.\r\nAnd you don't half know just what a good kid she really is. She's the\r\nreason we're here--we were down pretty close to bed-rock for a while,\r\nshe stood up when I wilted. She's got everything. She....\"\r\n\r\n\"Clam it yourself, Steve! Don't believe a word of it, Dad and Bill.\r\n_Wilt_!\" Nadia's voice dripped scorn. \"Why, he di....\"\r\n\r\n\"Please!\" Newton's voice was somewhat husky as he silenced the clamor of\r\nthe three young people, all talking at once. \"I will not embarrass you\r\nfurther by trying to say something that no words can express. You told\r\nme that you would take care of her, and I learn that you have done so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did what I could, but most of the credit belongs to her, no matter\r\nwhat she says,\" Stevens insisted. \"Anyway, sir, here she is; alive, well\r\nand ... unharmed,\" and his eyes bore unflinchingly the piercing gaze of\r\nthe older man, who was reassured and pleased by what he read therein.\r\n\"One thing I want to say right now, though, that may make you feel like\r\ncanceling the welcome. I loved Nadia even before the _Arcturus_ was\r\nattacked, and since then, coming to know her as I have, the feeling\r\nhasn't lessened any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nadia has already told me all about you two,\" said her father, \"and the\r\nwelcome stands. If you could take care of her as well as you have done\r\nsince you left the _Arcturus_, I have no doubt of your ability to take\r\ncare of her for life. We have been examining the work you have done\r\nhere, son, and the more I saw of it the more amazed I became that you\r\ncould have succeeded as you did. We are deeply indebted.... Just a\r\nminute! There's my call--I'm wanted in Fifteen. I'll see you again\r\ndirectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Norm!\" Stevens further relieved the surcharged atmosphere.\r\n\"As soon as you and Quince can leave those controls come over and see us,\r\nwill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x--coming up!\" sounded Brandon's deep and pleasant bass, and the\r\ntwo rescuers, who had tactfully avoided the family reunion, came over\r\nand greeted the third of their triumvirate.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, Perce--you look fit.\" Brandon ran an expert hand over Stevens'\r\narm and shoulder. \"Looks as if he might last a round or two, doesn't\r\nhe, Quince?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are looking fine, Steve. Neither of you appear any the worse for\r\nyour experiences. So this is Nadia? We have heard of you, Miss Newton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that, knowing Dad,\" she replied. \"Thanks, both of you, for\r\ndigging us out. I've heard about you two, and I'm going to kiss you\r\nboth.\"\r\n\r\nWestfall, the silent and reserved, was taken aback, but Brandon met her\r\nmore than half-way.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Nadia--payment in full received and hereby acknowledged,\" he\r\nlaughed, as he allowed her feet to return to the floor. \"Even if it was\r\nsome stout lads from Mars and Venus that did all the work we'll take the\r\nreward--especially since Alcantro and Fedanzo couldn't feel even such a\r\nhigh-voltage salute as that one was, and I can't picture you kissing a\r\nVenerian even if you could get to him. Whenever you get lost again, be\r\nsure to let us know, now that you've got our address. If I know Perce at\r\nall, you've heard of us 'til you're sick of it and us--it's a weakness\r\nof his--talking too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's no such th....\" began Nadia, but broke off as an aide came up\r\nand saluted smartly.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, but General Crowninshield requests that Doctor Brandon,\r\nDoctor Westfall, and Doctor Stevens join the council in Lounge Fifteen\r\nas soon as convenient.\" He saluted again and turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's right, folks--we've got to take a lot of steps, fast--see\r\nyou later,\" and Brandon, taking each of the other two by an arm, marched\r\nthem away toward the designated assembly room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere, already seated at a long table, were Czuv, King, and\r\nBreckenridge, all fully recovered, engaged in earnest conversation with\r\nNewton and Crowninshield. Alcantro and Fedanzo, the Martian scientists,\r\nwere listening intently, as were the two Venerians Dol Kenor and Pyraz\r\nAmonar. The eyes of the three newcomers, however, did not linger upon\r\nthe group at the table, but were irresistibly drawn to one corner of the\r\nroom, where six creatures lay in the heaviest manacles afforded by the\r\nstores of the Interplanetary Police. Not only were they manacled, but\r\neach was facing a ray-projector, held by a soldier whose expression\r\nshowed plainly that he would rather press the lethal contact than not.\r\n\r\n\"Oh--those the things we're fighting?\" Brandon stopped at the threshold\r\nand stared intently at the captive hexans. Goggling green eyes glaring\r\nvenomously, they were lying quiet, but tense; mighty muscles ready to\r\nburst into berserk activity should the attention of a guard waver for\r\na single instant.\r\n\r\nBut little more than half as large as the savage creatures with whom\r\nStevens had fought in the mountain glade upon Ganymede, the hexans\r\nresembled those aborigines only as civilized men might resemble gigantic\r\nprimordial savages of our own Earth. Brandon's gaze went from short,\r\npowerful legs up a round, red body to the enormous, freakish double pair\r\nof shoulders, with its peculiar universal jointing. From the double\r\nshoulders sprang four limbs, the front pair of which were undoubtedly\r\narms, terminating in large, but fairly normal, hands. The intermediate\r\nlimbs were longer than the legs and were much more powerful than the\r\narms, and ended in members that were very evidently feet and hands\r\ncombined. What in a human being would be the back of the hand was the\r\nsole of the foot--when walking upon that foot the long and dexterous\r\nthumb and fingers were curled up, out of the way and protected from\r\ninjury, in the palm of the hand. From the monstrous shoulders there\r\nrose a rather long and very flexible, yet massive and columnar neck,\r\nsupporting a head neither human nor bestial--a head utterly unknown to\r\nTerrestrial history or experience. The massive cranium bespoke a highly\r\ndeveloped and intelligent brain, as did the three large and expressive,\r\npeculiar, triangular eyes. The three sensitive ears were very long,\r\nerect, and sharply pointed. Each was set immediately above an eye, one\r\nupon each side of the head and one in front. Each ear was independently\r\nand instantly movable in any direction, to catch the faintest sound.\r\nThe head, like the body and limbs, was entirely devoid of hair. The\r\nhorns, so prominent in the savages Stevens had seen, were in this highly\r\nintelligent race but vestigial--three small, sharp, black protuberances\r\nonly an inch in length, one surmounting each ear, outlining the lofty\r\nforehead. The nose occupied almost the whole middle of the face and was\r\nnot really a nose--it developed into a small and active proboscis. The\r\nchin was receding almost to the point of disappearance, so that the\r\nmouth, with its multiple rows of small, sharp, gleaming-white teeth, was\r\nalmost hidden under the face instead of being a part of it. Such were\r\nthe hexans, at whom the Big Three stared in undisguised amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Attention, please!\" Newton called the meeting to order. \"We have\r\nlearned that all the passengers of the _Arcturus_, and all the crew save\r\nthree, are alive and safe for the time being. Most of them are upon the\r\nsatellite Europa. However, I understand that we are not yet sufficiently\r\nwell armed to withstand such an attack in force as will certainly\r\ndevelop when we move to rescue them. This seems to be a war of applied\r\nphysics--Doctor Brandon, as spokesman for the Scientific forces of the\r\nexpedition, what are your suggestions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anticipating an attack in response to signals probably sent out by the\r\nenemy,\" replied Brandon. \"I headed directly south immediately. We are\r\nnow well south the ecliptic, and are traveling at considerably more than\r\nfull Martian acceleration. Before making any suggestions, I should like\r\nto hear from Captain Czuv, who is more familiar than we are with the\r\ncommon enemy. Are they apt to follow us: can they detect us if we should\r\ndrift at constant velocity; and can we search the brains of the\r\nprisoners with his Callistonian thought-exchanger, if he should build\r\none with our help?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they are close enough to us to overtake us without too much lost\r\ntime, they will certainly attack us,\" Czuv answered at a nod from\r\nNewton. \"Ordinarily they would pursue us to the limits of the Solar\r\nSystem if necessary, but since they have suffered reverses of late and\r\ncannot spare any vessels, they will probably not pursue us far. Yes,\r\nthey can detect us, even without the driving rays, since this vessel\r\nuses much low-tension, low-frequency electricity in its automatic\r\nmachinery, lights, and so on. No; our thought-transformer cannot take\r\nthoughts by force, and the hexans will exchange no ideas with us. They\r\nare implacable and deadly foes of all humanity, irrespective of planet\r\nor race. Mercy is to them unknown--they neither give nor take quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can bear him out in that,\" Crowninshield interposed grimly. \"The\r\nfirst one to recover snapped our ordinary handcuffs like so much thread\r\nand literally tore four men to pieces before the rest of us could ray\r\nhim. Will you need me longer, Director Newton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not. General. Captain Czuv, you have made no headway with\r\nthem?\" asked the Director.\r\n\r\n\"None whatever, as I foretold. They understand me thoroughly, since two\r\nof them speak my own tongue, but nothing that they have said can ever\r\nbe repeated here. I knew from the first that all such attempts would be\r\nfruitless, but I have tried--and failed. I suggest what I suggested at\r\nfirst--put them to death, here and now, as they lie there, for most\r\nassuredly they will in some way contrive to take toll of lives of your\r\nown humanity if you allow them to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right,\" said Newton, \"but neither the General nor myself\r\ncan give the order for their death, since Interplanetary law does not\r\ncountenance such summary action. However, the guards are fully warned of\r\nthe peril, and will ray every prisoner at the first sign of unruliness.\r\nGeneral Crowninshield, you may remove the prisoners and deal with them\r\nin accordance with....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPandemonium reigned. At Crowninshield's signal for the guards to leave\r\nthe room with their captives, all six had strained furiously at their\r\nbonds and three of them had broken free in a flash, throwing themselves\r\nupon the guards with unthinkable ferocity. Stevens, seeing a\r\nray-projector in a hand of one of the prisoners, hurled his heavy chair\r\ninstantly and with terrific force. The projector flew into the air,\r\nshattered and useless, while the hexan was knocked into a corner by the\r\nmomentum of the massive projectile and lay there, stunned and broken.\r\nBrandon, likewise reacting instantaneously, had bent over and seized\r\na leg of the table, bracing his knee against the corner. With a mighty\r\nlunge of his powerful body he wrenched out the support and with a\r\ncontinuation of the same motion, he brought the jagged oak head of his\r\nterrible club down full upon the crown of the second hexan, who had\r\nalready torn one guard apart and was leaping toward Czuv, his hereditary\r\nfoe. In midflight he was dashed to the floor, his head a shapeless,\r\npulpy mass, and Brandon, bludgeon again aloft, strode deeper into the\r\nfray. For a brief moment searing lethal beams probed here and there,\r\nchains clanked and snapped, once more that ponderous and irresistible\r\noaken mace fell like the hammer of Thor, again spattering brains and\r\nblood abroad as it descended--then again came silence. The six erstwhile\r\nprisoners lay dead, but they had taken five of the guards with\r\nthem--literally dismembered, hideously torn limb from limb by the\r\nsuperhuman, incredible physical strength and utter ferocity of the\r\nhexans.\r\n\r\nBy common consent the meeting was adjourned to another room, for the\r\nbusiness in hand could not be postponed.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Czuv was right--we Tellurians could not believe in the\r\nexistence of such a race without the evidence of our own senses.\" Newton\r\nreopened the meeting. \"From this time on we take no prisoners. Doctor\r\nBrandon, you may resume.\"\r\n\r\n\"The detectors and lookouts will give ample warning of any attack, and\r\nDoctor Westfall has suggested that we should have all possible facts\r\nat hand before we try to decide upon a course of action. We should like\r\nto hear the full reports of Captain King, Captain Czuv, Chief Pilot\r\nBreckenridge, and Doctor Stevens.\"\r\n\r\nThe four men told their stories tersely and rapidly, while the others\r\nlistened in deep attention. As the last speaker sat down, Newton again\r\nturned to Brandon, who silently jerked his head at Westfall, knowing his\r\nown inadequacy in such a situation--realizing that here was needed\r\nWestfall's cold and methodical thinking.\r\n\r\n\"Director Newton and gentlemen,\" Westfall spoke calmly and precisely.\r\n\"We have much to do before we can meet the hexans upon equal terms.\r\nWe have many new fields of force and rays to develop, of whose nature\r\nand necessity Doctor Brandon is already aware. Then, too, we must\r\nrecalculate our visirays so that we can operate at greater range and\r\nefficiency. We must also examine the hexan space-ship which is towing,\r\nto do which it will be desirable to drift at constant velocity for a\r\ntime. In it we may find instruments or devices as yet unknown to us.\r\nIt also occurs to me that since this is an Interplanetary Police problem\r\nof the first magnitude, we should at once get in touch with Police\r\nHeadquarters, so that the Peace Fleet can be armed as we ourselves are,\r\nor shall be, armed; for a large and highly efficient fleet will be\r\nnecessary to do that which must be done. It is, of course, a foregone\r\nconclusion that Interplanetary humanity will support the humanity of\r\nCallisto against the hexans.\r\n\r\n\"It is also self-evident that we must stay here and rescue the\r\nTellurians now upon Europa and Callisto, but we are not yet in position\r\nto decide just how that rescue is to be accomplished. Four courses are\r\napparently open to us. First, to attempt it as soon as we shall have\r\nstrengthened our armament as much as is now possible. That would invite\r\na massed attack, and in my opinion would be foolish--probably suicidal.\r\nSecond, to stand by at a distance until the rocket-ship is launched,\r\nthen to escort it back to the Earth. Third, to aid the Callistonians as\r\nmuch as possible while awaiting the completion of the rocket-vessel.\r\nFourth, and perhaps the most feasible and quickest, it may be possible\r\nfor the Callistonian rocket-ships to bring out fellow-Tellurians, a few\r\nat a time, to us here out in space, since they are apparently able to\r\ncome and go at will. However, I would recommend that we make no plans\r\nfor the rescue as yet--there is little use in attempting to deal with an\r\never-changing situation until we are ready to act forthwith. I suggest\r\nthat we strengthen our offensive and defensive armament first, then\r\nsecure information as to the exact status of affairs, both upon Callisto\r\nand upon Europa. Then, ready to act, we will do at once whatever seems\r\ncalled for by the situation then obtaining.\"\r\n\r\n\"The program as outlined seems eminently sensible. Are there any\r\ncomments or suggestions?\" None having been offered, Director Newton\r\nadjourned the meeting and each man attacked his particular problem.\r\n\r\nTrue to Czuv's prediction the hexans did not deem it worthwhile to\r\npursue the Terrestrial vessel, so obviously and so earnestly fleeing\r\nfrom them, and shortly, the acceleration was cut off, to render possible\r\na thorough study of the two halves of the spherical warship of the\r\nenemy. Scientists donned space-suits and studied every feature of\r\nthe strange vessel, while mechanics dismantled and transferred to the\r\n_Sirius_ every device and instrument of interest. One or two novel and\r\nuseful applications of rays and forces were found, their visirays and\r\ncommunicators in particular being of a high degree of efficiency; but\r\nupon the whole the science of the hexans was found to be inferior to\r\nthat now known to the scientists of Interplanetary's flying laboratory.\r\nBrandon studied the hexan power-system most carefully, and, everything\r\nin readiness and after a long talk with Westfall, he called a general\r\nconference in the control-room.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, we have done about everything we can do for the time being.\r\nBy combining the best features of the visirays and communicators of\r\nthe hexans with our own newly-perfected devices, we now have a really\r\nexcellent system of communication. Our friends from Mars and Venus\r\nhave so altered and enlarged our force-controls that our offensive\r\nand defensive fields, rays, and screens leave little to be desired.\r\nIn power we are far ahead of the enemy. They apparently know nothing\r\nof the possibilities of cosmic radiation, but depend upon tight-beam\r\ntransmission from their own power-plants--which transmission they have\r\nperfected to a point far beyond anything reached by us of the three\r\nplanets. They do not use accumulators, and therefore their dissipation\r\nis limited to their maximum reception, which is about seventy thousand\r\nkilofranks. Since we can dissipate ten times that amount of energy, we\r\ncould withstand, for a short time, the simultaneous attacks of ten of\r\ntheir vessels. Eleven or more of them, however, would be able to crush\r\nour defensive screens--and Captain Czuv has seen as many as a hundred of\r\ntheir space-ships in one formation. Furthermore, since they have several\r\ntimes our maximum acceleration, they could concentrate quickly upon any\r\ndesired point. We could not escape them by flight if they really set out\r\nto overtake us, which they certainly will do if we again venture into\r\ntheir territory. Therefore it is clear that we cannot subject ourselves\r\nto any attack in force and it follows that we cannot do much of anything\r\nuntil the police fleet of some five hundred vessels can be re-armed and\r\ncan join us near Callisto. This will require several months at best.\r\nAs you already know, it has been decided that we should not return to\r\nany of the minor planets, as to do so might invite a hexan attack upon\r\nour police fleet which is as yet unprepared. We are now heading for\r\nUranus, in the hope that such a course will distract the attention of\r\nthe hexans from Tellus, even though they probably already know that we\r\nare Tellurians. Our new communicator ray will reach any member of the\r\nJovian system from this point. It has been decided that it is safe to\r\nuse it, since it employs an almost absolutely tight beam of very small\r\ndiameter, and since we know that that one hexan vessel, at least, had\r\nno apparatus sufficiently sensitive to detect a beam of that nature.\r\nWe will therefore now get in touch with the Callistonians and with our\r\nown people.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBrandon seated himself before the communicator screen, and while the\r\nothers packed themselves closely around his stool, he snapped on the\r\nvisiray and turned the dials which directed that invisible, immensely\r\ncomplex beam through space. The screen was apparently in itself a coign\r\nof vantage, flying through space with the velocity of light, and the\r\nwatchers gasped involuntarily and drew themselves together, as with that\r\nunthinkable speed they flashed down toward the surface of Callisto.\r\nSo realistic was the impression that they themselves were hurtling\r\nthrough the void, that they could scarcely reason themselves into\r\nbelieving their positive knowledge that the impending collision was\r\nnot an actual happening! Reducing the velocity of the projection\r\nabruptly as it approached the satellite, Brandon flashed it down into\r\na crater indicated by Czuv, and along a tunnel to the city of Zbardk,\r\nwhere the Callistonian captain held a long conversation with the Council\r\nof the nation. Frowning in thought, he turned to Newton and spoke\r\nseriously and slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after the loss of our super-plane, with the supposed death\r\nof King, Breckenridge, and myself, the other Tellurian officers were\r\nreturned to Europa, since even they could be of no assistance to us\r\nCallistonians in our struggle against the new, high-acceleration vessels\r\nof the hexans. The present situation is much more serious than I would\r\nhave believed possible. The last vessel going to visit Wruszk, our city\r\nupon Europa, was caught and destroyed by the hexans, and for many weeks\r\nno ship or message has come from there to Callisto. In spite of the fact\r\nthat the hexan fleet is smaller than ever before, they are guarding\r\nEuropa very closely. It is feared that they may have found and destroyed\r\nour city there--an expedition is even now about to set out in a\r\ndesperate attempt to learn the fate of our fellows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the rays of the lifeboats were detected in landing?\" asked\r\nBrandon. \"That might have given them a clue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly; but it is equally possible that our own men became careless\r\nin the operation of one of our own vessels. Having been unmolested so\r\nlong, they might have relaxed their vigilance. We may never know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell 'em to cancel the expedition--we'll shoot the visiray over\r\nthere right now and find out all about it. We'll let them know pretty\r\nquickly. Also, you might tell them that you've got complete plans and\r\nspecifications for all the weapons that the hexans have, and a couple\r\nbesides, and that the quicker they shoot a ship out here after you, the\r\nsooner they can get to building some stuff to blow those hexans clear\r\nout of space!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the work of only a few moments to drive the visiray projection\r\nto Europa, where Czuv, to the great relief of all, found that the hexans\r\nhad not yet discovered either Wruszk or the Terrestrial workings.\r\nAll Europan humanity, fully aware of the hexan investment, was\r\nexerting every possible precaution against discovery by the enemy.\r\nThis information was duly flashed to the Council of Callisto, and the\r\nprojection was then hurled across the intervening reaches of space and\r\ninto the cavern in which was being built the enormous rocket-ship in\r\nwhich the Terrestrial refugees were to attempt the long voyage back\r\nto their own distant planet.\r\n\r\nIt took some little time to convince Doctor Penfield that there had\r\nbeen projected into the empty air of his little sanctum an absolutely\r\ninvisible and impalpable structure of pure force capable of receiving\r\nand transmitting voice and vision. Once convinced of the reality of the\r\nphenomenon, however, the speaker beside Brandon's communicator screen\r\nfairly rattled under the fervor of his greeting, so great was his\r\npleasure at the arrival of the expedition of relief and in knowing that\r\nKing and Breckenridge, whom they had, of course, given up for dead, were\r\naboard the Interplanetary vessel.\r\n\r\nPenfield reported that the work upon the great rocket-ship was\r\nprogressing satisfactorily, although slowly, since it was so much larger\r\nthan any vessel theretofore constructed by the Callistonians. Newton,\r\nin turn, informed the autocrat of the stranded Terrestrials as to the\r\n_status quo_ of the rescuing party.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, because of the hexan blockade, you cannot take us off until\r\nthey have been wiped out, which will be several months at best,\" the\r\nsurgeon said, slowly, and a shadow came over his face as he spoke.\r\n\"Well, what can't be cured....\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble with the personnel?\" King broke in sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Personnel, yes; but not trouble in the sense you mean--we have had\r\nnone of that. It is only that there are four more of us now than there\r\nwere....\"\r\n\r\n\"Huh? How come?\" demanded Brandon, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Four babies have been born to us here so far, and several more are\r\ncoming. They are the ones I'm worried about. Most normal adults can\r\nstand it here without any serious effects, but this thin atmosphere and\r\nweak gravity are certain to result in abnormal development of children.\r\nHowever, there may be another way out of it. Are you using normal\r\nacceleration, or have you Martians aboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both,\" replied Brandon. \"We are carrying two inhabitants of Mars,\r\nbut Alcantro and Fedanzo are not ordinary Martians. They have been in\r\nconstant training ever since we left Tellus, and now they can stand as\r\nhigh an acceleration as a weak Tellurian. We're riding at normal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! As you already know, there has been no communication of late\r\nbetween here and Callisto. It had already been decided, however, that\r\none more voyage must be risked, in order to bring back material which\r\nis most urgently needed. Since the vessel will leave here light and is\r\nlarge enough to carry about thirty passengers on a short trip with some\r\ncrowding, the Council will probably approve of having it carry some of\r\nour passengers out to the _Sirius_--especially now, since a vessel must\r\nvisit you, anyway, to get Captain Czuv and the specifications of the new\r\narmament. All these things can be done with one vessel in one trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds fine!\" boomed King. \"It will give me a chance to get back\r\nthere where I belong, too. Whom are you sending out?\"\r\n\r\n\"The seven couples who either have babies already or who will have them\r\nin the next few months; and some of our young who aren't standing the\r\ngaff any too well. You won't be in the red very deeply on the deal,\r\neither--while two or three of the passengers I am sending you will\r\ncertainly be a nuisance; anybody could use, anywhere, such men as\r\nCommander Sanderson and Lieut...\"\r\n\r\n\"Sanderson!\" interrupted King. \"Why, he wasn't--when did _he_ get\r\nmarried?\"\r\n\r\n\"The day after we arrived here,\" replied the surgeon. \"His fiancee was\r\naboard the _Arcturus_, and when they found out how long we would have\r\nto be here, they very sensibly decided not to wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there any others?\" demanded Nadia, who, standing between Stevens\r\nand her father, had been an interested listener.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of them! Fourteen of our young women passengers have married\r\nhere upon Europa. A few married fellow-passengers, but most of them\r\npicked out officers of the _Arcturus_. You'll find your staff made up\r\npretty largely of benedicts now, King! We've been here a year, you know,\r\nand time will tell! Young Commander Sanderson's a fine baby--he'll be a\r\ncredit to the IPC some day, if we can get him aboard the _Sirius_, where\r\nhe can get a good start. We could give our babies normal air pressure\r\nhere by building special rooms, but we cannot give them the normal\r\nacceleration necessary to develop their muscles properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'd better snap over to Callisto and take this up with the\r\nCouncil,\" Brandon put in. \"I don't imagine that there will be any\r\nobjections, so you might as well get your ship gassed up and\r\nloaded--we'll be back here with the okay in about a minute and a half.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith Brandon at the controls and with Czuv at the communicator plate,\r\nthe projection flashed toward distant Callisto and the group melted\r\naway, each man going about his interrupted task.\r\n\r\n\"Daddy, take us somewhere--I want to talk to you,\" Nadia spoke to her\r\nfather, and the director led her and Stevens to his own room.\r\n\r\n\"All x, daughter; out with it!\" and he bent upon her a quizzical glance,\r\nunder which a fiery blush burned from her throat to her forehead.\r\n\r\n\"Dad, I've been thinking a lot since you rescued us, and what we've just\r\nheard has given me the nerve to say it. Steve, of course, wouldn't dare\r\nsuggest such a thing until we're safely back on Earth, so I will.\" Her\r\ndeep brown eyes held his steadily. \"All those girls got married--why,\r\nsome of them have babies already--and Steve and I have waited for each\r\nother _so_ long, daddy! And _none_ of them love each other the way we\r\ndo. Do they, Steve?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how they could, sir; and that goes straight across the\r\npanel,\" and he bore unflinchingly the piercing gaze of the older man\r\nas his right arm encircled the girl and held her close.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why not?\" A sudden smile transformed Newton's stern visage.\r\n\"There are three chaplains with the police--a Methodist minister,\r\na Catholic priest, and a Jewish rabbi. Also, we have on board two\r\nfull-fledged I-P captains, either of whom is authorized to tie\r\nmatrimonial knots. The means are not lacking--if you're both sure of\r\nyourselves?\" and all levity disappeared as he studied the two young\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are sure,\" he continued after a moment \"just as her mother and\r\nI were--and are. It is too bad that she cannot be here with you, but it\r\nmay be a long time before we can return to Tellus, and you have indeed\r\nwaited long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh thanks, Daddy, you're just a perfectly wonderful old darling!\" Nadia\r\nexclaimed, as she threw her arms rapturously around his neck. \"And this\r\nisn't a warship at all--you know perfectly well that it's a research\r\nlaboratory, and that as soon as the Navy gets here, you won't let it\r\nfight a bit more, because such scientists can't be allowed to risk\r\nthemselves! And also, you're forgetting that whole flock of women and\r\nbabies that are coming out here just as fast as they can get themselves\r\nready. So get going, daddy old dear, and let's do things! Steve's a\r\nQuaker and we're Presbyterians, so none of the chaplains will do at all.\r\nBesides, I promised Captain King ages ago that he could marry me, so go\r\nget him and we'll do it now. Bill can be my bridesmaid, you'll give me\r\naway, and Steve can have the other two of his Big Three for best men.\r\nI'm off to hunt up the flimsiest, fussiest white dress I can find in my\r\ntrunks. Let's go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Newton.\" Stevens spoke thoughtfully as Nadia darted away. \"You said\r\nsomething about her mother, I didn't want to say anything to raise false\r\nhopes while she was here, but I've got an idea. Let's meet in Brandon's\r\nroom instead of here. We can send code to Tellus easily enough on our\r\nultrawave, and we may be able to fake up something on vision.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the Big Three were in Brandon's private study;\r\nstaring intently into a screen of ground glass upon which played\r\nflickering, flashing lights, while the black-haired physicist\r\nmanipulated micrometer dials in infinitesimal arcs.\r\n\r\n\"Once more, Mac,\" Brandon directed. \"Pretty nearly had them that time.\r\nWe're stretching this projector about six hundred percent, but we've got\r\nto make this connection. Can't you give me just a little more voltage on\r\nthose secondaries?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can _not_!\" the voice of the first assistant snapped from the\r\nspeaker. \"I'm overloading now so badly that some of my plates are\r\ngetting hot--if I hold this voltage much longer, the whole secondary\r\nbank of tubes is going out. All x--you're on zero!\"\r\n\r\n\"All x!\" Flashing and waning, the lights upon the screen formed\r\nfleeting, shifting, nebulous images of a relay station upon distant\r\nEarth; but the utmost power of the transmitting fields could neither\r\nsteady the image nor hold it.\r\n\r\n\"Back off, Mac,\" Brandon instructed. \"I'm afraid we can't hold 'em\r\ndirect--no use blowing a bank of tubes. We'll try relaying through\r\nMars--we can hold them there, I think. It will muss up reception some,\r\nbut it will probably be better than direct, at that. Point oh five three\r\nsix ... all x--shoot!\"\r\n\r\nBrandon's relay station upon Mars was finally raised and held, and\r\na corps of keenly interested engineers there made short work of the\r\nEarth-Mars linkage. Soon the screen glowed with the picture of the\r\ntransmitter-room of the Terrestrial station, and while the three men\r\nwere waiting for Mrs. Newton to be called to her own television set,\r\nthe door behind them opened. Nadia and her escorts entered the room--but\r\nStevens' eyes saw only the entrancing vision of loveliness that was his\r\nbride. Dressed in a clinging white gown of shimmering silk, her hair a\r\ngolden blond corona, sweetly curved lips slightly parted and wide eyes\r\neloquent, she paused momentarily as Stevens came to his feet and stared\r\nat her, his very heart in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You never saw me in a dress before--do you like me, Steve?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Like_ you! You're beautiful!\" and gray eyes and brown, deep with\r\nwonder and with love, met and held as, unheeding the presence of their\r\nfriends, they went into each other's arms in a coalescence as inevitable\r\nand as final as Fate itself.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Nadia old dear!\" and \"Daughter, from what I can see of my\r\nson-in-law, I believe that he may do,\" came together from the speaker.\r\nNadia tore herself from Stevens' embrace, to see upon the lambent screen\r\nthe happily smiling faces of her mother and sister.\r\n\r\n\"Mother! Claire! Oh, you three wonder-workers!\" She addressed\r\nsimultaneously the distant Terrestrials and the scientists at her side,\r\nwhile broken exclamations, punctuated by ominous, crackling snaps, came\r\nfrom the laboring amplifier.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt,\" MacDonald's voice broke in, \"but you'll have to\r\nhurry it up. Alcantro and Fedanzo are doing their best, but every plate\r\nin my secondary bank's red hot, and you could fry an egg on any one of\r\nmy transformers. Even my primary tubes are running hot. She won't hold\r\ntogether five minutes longer!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain King opened his book, and in that small steel room, unadorned\r\nsave for stack upon stack of bookcases, the brief but solemn ceremony\r\njoining two young lives was read--its solemnity only intensified by its\r\nunique accompaniment. For from Brandon at the primary controls, through\r\nthe power-room of the _Sirius_ and the relay-station upon Mars, to the\r\nimmense Interplanetary transmitter upon Earth, the greatest radio and\r\ntelevision engineers of two planets were fighting overdriven equipment,\r\ntrying to hold an almost impossible connection, in order that Nadia\r\nNewton's mother and sister might be present at her wedding, hundreds of\r\nmillions of miles distant in space!\r\n\r\n\"I pronounce you man and wife. Whom God hath joined, let no man put\r\nasunder.\" The sacred old ritual ended and Captain King picked up\r\nthe bride in his great arms as though she were a baby, kissed her\r\nvigorously, and set her down in front of the transmitter. In the midst\r\nof the joyous confusion that ensued a tearing, rattling crash came from\r\nthe speaker and the screen went blank.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" lamented MacDonald from the power room. \"I knew they'd blow!\r\nThere goes my whole secondary bank--eight perfectly good ten-nineteens\r\nall shot to....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad, but it couldn't be helped; they went for a good cause,\"\r\ninterrupted Brandon. \"I'll come down and help clean up the mess.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving the bridal party, he made his way rapidly to the power room,\r\nwhere he found MacDonald and the two Martians inspecting the smoking\r\nremains of what had been the secondary bank of their powerful\r\nultra-transmitter. Spare parts in abundance were on hand, and it was\r\nnot long until the damaged section was apparently as good as new.\r\n\r\n\"Now to try her out,\" Brandon announced. \"We want to give her a good\r\nworkout, but there's no use trying the I-P stations any more--they're\r\naltogether too hard to handle at this range. Czuv said something about\r\nan unknown race of monstrosities at the south pole of Jupiter--let's try\r\nit on them for a while.\"\r\n\r\nHe flung the field of force out into space, as responsive to his will\r\nas a well-trained horse, and guided it toward the southern limb of that\r\ngigantic world. Down and down the projection plunged, through mile after\r\nmile of reeking, steaming fog, impenetrable to earthly eyes. Finally it\r\ncame to rest upon the surface, hundreds of feet deep in a lush, dank,\r\ntropical jungle, and Brandon plugged into the Venerian room.\r\n\r\n\"Kenor? We've got a lot of use for you, if you can come down here for a\r\nwhile. Thanks a lot.\" He turned to the Martians. \"Luckily, we've got a\r\ncouple of infra-red transformers aboard, so we won't have to build one.\r\nYou fellows might break one out and shunt it onto this circuit while Dol\r\nKenor is hunting up something for us to look at.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, old Infra-Eyes!\" he went on, as the Venerian scientist waddled into\r\nthe room in his bulging space-suit. \"We've got something here that's\r\nright down your alley. Want to see what you can see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, a beautiful scene!\" exclaimed Dol Kenor, after one glance into the\r\nplate. \"It is indeed a relief, after all this coldness and glare, to\r\nsee such a soft, warm landscape--even though I have never expected to\r\nbehold quite such a violent bit of jungle,\" and under his guidance the\r\nprojection flashed over hundreds of miles of territory. To the eyes of\r\nthe Terrestrials the screen revealed only a blank, amorphous grayness,\r\nthrough which at times there shot lines and masses of vague and\r\nmeaningless form; but the Venerian was very evidently seeing and\r\nenjoying many and diverse scenes.\r\n\r\n\"There, I think, is what you wish to see first,\" he announced, as he\r\nfinally steadied the controls, and Brandon cut in upon the shunting\r\nscreen the infra-red transformer. This device, developed long before to\r\nrender possible the use of Terrestrial eyes in the opaque atmosphere of\r\nVenus, stepped up the fog-piercing long waves into the frequencies of\r\nlight capable of affecting the earthly retina. Instantly the dull gray\r\nblank of the shunting screen became transformed into a clear and\r\ncolorful picture of the great city of the Jovians of the South.\r\n\r\n\"Great Cat!\" Brandon exclaimed. \"Flying fortresses is right! They're in\r\nwar formation, too, or I'm a polyp! We've got to watch this, Mac, all\r\nof it, and watch it close--it's apt to have a big bearing on what we'll\r\nhave to do, before they get done. Better we rig up another set, and put\r\na relay of observers on this job!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe Vorkul-Hexan War\r\n\r\n\r\nVorkulia, the city of the Vorkuls, was an immense seven-pointed\r\nstar. At its center, directly upon the south pole of Jupiter, rose a\r\ntremendous shaft--its cross-section likewise a tapering seven-pointed\r\nstar--which housed the directing intelligence of the nation. Radiating\r\nfrom the seven cardinal points of the building were short lanes leading\r\nto star-shaped open plots, from which in turn branched out ways to other\r\nstellate areas; ways reaching, after many such steps, to the towering\r\ninner walls of the metropolis. The outer walls, still loftier and even\r\nmore massive ramparts of sullen gray-green metal, formed a seamless,\r\njointless barrier against an utterly indescribable foe; a barrier whose\r\nouter faces radiated constantly a searing, coruscating green emanation.\r\nMetal alone could not long have barred that voracious and implacably\r\nrelentless enemy, but against that lethal green emanation even that\r\nravening Jovian jungle could not prevail, but fell back, impotent.\r\nWrithing and crawling, loathesomely palpitant with an unspeakable\r\nexuberance of foul and repellent vigor, possible only to such\r\nmeteorological conditions as obtained there, it threw its most\r\nhideously prolific growths against that radiant wall in vain.\r\n\r\nThe short, zig-zag lanes, the ways, and the seven-pointed areas\r\nwere paved with a greenish glass. This pavement was intended solely\r\nto prevent vegetable growth and carried no traffic whatever, since few\r\nindeed of the Vorkuls have ever been earth-bound and all traffic was in\r\nthe air. The principal purpose of the openings was to separate, and\r\nthus to render accessible by air, the mighty buildings which, level\r\nupon level, towered upward, with airships hovering at or anchored to\r\ndoorways and entrances at every level. Buildings, entrances, everything\r\nvisible--all replicated, reiterated, repeated infinite variations in\r\nthe one theme, that of the septenate stelliform.\r\n\r\nColor ran riot; masses varied from immense blocks of awe-inspiring\r\ngrandeur to delicate tracery of sheerest gossamer; lights flamed and\r\nflared in wide bands and in narrow, flashing pencils--but in all,\r\nthrough all, over all, and dominating all was the Seven-Pointed Star.\r\n\r\nIn and almost filling the space, at least a mile in width,\r\nbetween the inner and the outer walls were huge, seven-sided\r\nstructures--featureless, squat, forbidding heptagons of dull green\r\nmetal. No thing living was to be seen in that space. Its pavement was\r\nof solid metal and immensely thick, and that metal, as well as that of\r\nthe walls, was burned and blackened and seared as though by numberless\r\nexposures to intolerable flame. In a lower compartment of one of these\r\nenormous heptagons Vortel Kromodeor, First Projector Officer, rested\r\nbefore a gigantic and complex instrument board. He was at ease--his huge\r\nwings folded, his sinuous length coiled comfortably in slack loops about\r\ntwo horizontal bars. But at least one enormous, extensible eye was\r\nalways pointed toward the board, always was at least one nimble and\r\nbat-like ear cocked attentively in the direction of the signal panel.\r\n\r\nA whistling, shrieking ululation rent the air and the officer's coils\r\ntightened as he reared a few feet of his length upright, shooting out\r\nhalf a dozen tentacular arms to various switches and controls upon his\r\nboard, while throughout the great heptagon, hundreds of other Vorkuls\r\nsprang to attention at their assigned posts of duty. As the howling wail\r\ncame to a climax in a blast of sound Kromodeor threw over a lever, as\r\ndid every other projector officer in every other heptagon, and there was\r\nmade plain to any observer the reason for the burns and scars in the\r\ntortured space between the lofty inner and outer walls of Vorkulia.\r\nFor these heptagons were the monstrous flying fortresses which Czuv\r\nhad occasionally seen from afar, as they went upon some unusual errand\r\nabove the Jovian banks of mist, and which Brandon was soon to see in\r\nhis visiray screen. The seared and disfigured metal of the pavement\r\nand walls was made so by the release of the furious blasts of energy\r\nnecessary to raise those untold thousands of tons of mass against the\r\nattraction of Jupiter, more than two and a half times the gravity of our\r\nown world! Vast volumes of flaming energy shrieked from the ports. Wave\r\nupon wave, flooding the heptagons, it dashed back and forth upon the\r\nheavy metal between the walls. As more and more of the inconceivable\r\npower of those Titanic generators was unleashed, it boiled forth in\r\na devastating flood which, striking the walls, rebounded and leaped\r\nvertically far above even those mighty ramparts. Even the enormous\r\nthickness of the highly conducting metal could not absorb all the\r\nenergy of that intolerable blast, and immediately beneath the ports new\r\nseven-pointed areas of disfigurement appeared as those terrific flying\r\nfortresses were finally wrenched from the ground and hurled upward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHigh in the air, another signal wailed up and down a peculiar scale of\r\nsound and the mighty host of vessels formed smoothly into symmetrical\r\ngroups of seven. Each group then moved with mathematical precision into\r\nits allotted position in a complex geometrical formation--a gigantic,\r\nseven-ribbed, duplex cone in space. The flagship flew at the apex of\r\nthis stupendous formation; behind, and protected by, the full power\r\nof the other floating citadels of the forty-nine groups of seven.\r\nDue north, the amazing armada sped in rigorous alignment, flying along\r\na predetermined meridian--due north!\r\n\r\nAt the end of his watch Kromodeor relinquished his board to the officer\r\nrelieving him and shot into the air, propelled by the straightening of\r\nthe powerful coils of his snake-like body and tail. Wings half spread,\r\nlateral and vertical ruddering fins outthrust, he soared across the room\r\ntoward a low opening. Just before they struck the wall upon either side\r\nof the doorway the great wings snapped shut, the fins retracted, and the\r\nlong and heavy body struck the floor of the passage without a jar. With\r\na wriggling, serpentine motion he sped like a vibrant arrow along the\r\nhall and into a wardroom. There, after a brief glance around the room,\r\nhe coiled up beside a fellow officer who, with one eye, was negligently\r\nreading a scroll held in three or four hands; while with another eye,\r\npoised upon its slender pedicle, he watched a moving picture upon a\r\ntelevision screen.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Kromodeor,\" Wixill, Chief Power Officer[2] greeted the newcomer\r\nin the wailing, hissing language of the Vorkuls. He tossed the scroll\r\ninto the air, where it instantly rolled into a tight cylinder and shot\r\ninto an opening in the wall of the room. \"Glad to see you. Books and\r\nshows are all right on practice cruises, but I can't seem to work up\r\nmuch enthusiasm about such things now.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In order to avoid all unnecessary strain upon the memory of\r\nthe reader, all titles, etc., have been given in the closest possible\r\nEnglish equivalent, instead of in an attempted transliteration of the\r\nforeign word. This particular officer has no counterpart upon Tellurian\r\nvessels. He is the second in command of a Vorkulian fortress, his\r\nfunction being to supervise all expenditure of power.--E. E. S.]\r\n\r\nKromodeor elevated an eye and studied the screen, upon which, to the\r\naccompaniment of whistling, shrieking sound, whirled and gyrated an\r\ninterlacing group of serpentine forms.\r\n\r\n\"A good show, Wixill,\" the projector officer replied, \"but nothing to\r\nhold the attention of men engaged in what we are doing. Think of it!\r\nAfter twenty years of preparation--two long lifetimes--and for the first\r\ntime in our history, we are actually going to war!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of it at length. It is disgusting. Compelled to traffic\r\nwith an alien form of life! Were it not to end in the extinction of\r\nthose unspeakable hexans, it would be futile to the point of silliness.\r\nI cannot understand them at all. There is ample room upon this planet\r\nfor all of us. Our races combined are not using one seven-thousandth\r\nof its surface. You would think that they would shun all strangers.\r\nYet for ages have they attacked us, refusing to let us alone, until\r\nfinally they forced us to prepare means for their destruction. They\r\nseem as senselessly savage as the jungle growths, and, but for their\r\nvery evident intelligence, one would class them as such. You would\r\nthink that, being intelligent and being alien to us, they would not\r\nhave anything to do with us in any way, peacefully or otherwise.\r\nHowever, their intrusions and depredations are about to end.\"\r\n\r\n\"They certainly are. Vorkulia has endured much--too much--but I am glad\r\nthat our forefathers did not decide to exterminate them sooner. If they\r\nhad, we could not have been doing this now.\"\r\n\r\n\"There speaks the rashness of youth, Kromodeor. It is a violation of all\r\nour instincts to have any commerce with outsiders, as you will learn as\r\nsoon as you see one of them. Then, too, we will lose heavily. Since we\r\nhave studied their armaments so long, and have subjected every phase of\r\nthe situation to statistical analysis, it is certain that we are to\r\nsucceed--but you also know at what cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two-sevenths of our force, with a probable error of one in seven,\"\r\nreplied the younger Vorkul. \"And because that figure cannot be improved\r\nwithin the next seven years and because of the exceptional weakness of\r\nthe hexans due to their unexpectedly great losses upon Callisto, we are\r\nattacking at this time. Their spherical vessels are nothing, of course.\r\nIt is in the reduction of the city that we will lose men and vessels.\r\nBut at that, each of us has five chances in seven of returning, which is\r\ngood enough odds--much better than we had in that last expedition into\r\nthe jungle. But by the Mighty Seven, I shall make myself wrap around one\r\nhexan, for my brother's sake,\" and his coils tightened unconsciously.\r\n\"Hideous, repulsive monstrosities! Creatures so horrible should not\r\nbe allowed to live--they should have been tossed over the wall to\r\nthe jungle ages ago!\" Kromodeor curled out an eye as he spoke, and\r\ncomplacently surveyed the writhing cylinder of sinuous, supple power\r\nthat was his own body.\r\n\r\n\"Better avoid contact work with them if possible,\" cautioned Wixill.\r\n\"You might not be able to unwrap, and to touch one of them is almost\r\nunthinkable. Speaking of wrapping, you know that they are putting on the\r\nfinals of the contact work in the star this evening. Let's watch them.\"\r\n\r\nThey slid to the floor and wriggled away in perfect \"step\"--undulating\r\nalong in such nice synchronism that their adjacent sides, only a few\r\ninches apart, formed two waving rigidly parallel lines. Deep in the\r\nlower part of the fortress they entered a large assembly room, provided\r\nwith a raised platform in the center and having hundreds of short,\r\nupright posts in lieu of chairs; most of which were already taken by\r\nspectators. The two officers curled their tails comfortably around two\r\nof the vacant pillars, elevated their heads to a convenient level of\r\nsight and directed each an eye or two upon the stage. This was, of\r\ncourse, heptagonal. Its sides, like those of the mighty flying forts\r\nthemselves, were not straight, but angled inward sufficiently to make\r\nthe platform a seven-pointed star. The edge was outlined by a low rail,\r\nand bulwark and floor were padded with thick layers of a hard but smooth\r\nand yielding fabric.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this star-shaped ring two young Vorkuls were contending for the\r\nchampionship of the fleet in a contest that seemed to combine most of\r\nthe features of wrestling, boxing, and bar-room brawling, with no holds\r\nbarred. Four hands of each of the creatures held heavy leather billies,\r\nand could be used only in striking with those weapons, the remaining\r\nhands being left free to employ as the owner saw fit. Since the sport\r\nwas not intended to be lethal, however, the eyes and other highly\r\nvulnerable parts were protected by metal masks, and the wing ribs\r\nwere similarly guarded by leathern shields. The guiding fins, being\r\ncomparatively small and extremely tough, required no protection.\r\n\r\n\"We're just in time,\" Kromodeor whistled. \"The main bout is nicely on.\r\nSee anyone from the flagship? I might stake a couple of korpels that\r\nSintris will paint the symbol upon his wing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of their men seem to be across the star,\" Wixill replied, and both\r\nbeings fell silent, absorbed in the struggle going on in the ring.\r\n\r\nIt was a contest well worth watching. Wing crashed against mighty wing\r\nand the lithe, hard bodies snapped and curled this way and that, almost\r\nfaster than the eye could follow, in quest of advantageous holds. Above\r\nthe shrieking wails of the crowd could be heard the smacks and thuds of\r\nthe eight flying clubs as they struck against the leather shields or\r\nagainst tough and scaly hides. For minutes the conflict raged, with no\r\nadvantage apparent. Now the fighters were flat upon the floor of the\r\nstar, now dozens of feet in the air above it, as one or the other sought\r\nto gain a height from which to plunge downward upon his opponent; but\r\nboth stayed upon or over the star--to leave its boundaries was to lose\r\ndisgracefully.\r\n\r\nThen, high in air, the visiting warrior thought that he saw an opening\r\nand grappled. Wings crashed in fierce blows, hands gripped and furiously\r\nwrenched. Two powerful bodies, tapering smoothly down to equally\r\npowerful tails, corkscrewed around each other viciously, winding up into\r\nsomething resembling tightly twisted lamp cord; and the two Vorkuls,\r\neach helpless, fell to the mat with a crash. Fast as was Zerexi, the\r\ngladiator from the flagship, Sintris was the merest trifle faster.\r\nLike the straightening of a twisted spring of tempered steel that long\r\nbody uncoiled as they struck the floor, and up under those shielding\r\nwings--an infinitesimal fraction of a second slow in interposing--that\r\nlithe tail sped. Two lightning loops flashed around the neck of the\r\nvisitor and tightened inexorably. Desperately the victim fought to break\r\nthat terrible strangle hold, but every maneuver was countered as soon\r\nas it was begun. Beating wings, under whose frightful blows the very air\r\nquivered, were met and parried by wings equally capable. Hands and clubs\r\nwere of no avail against that corded cable of sinew, and Sintris, his\r\nhead retracted between his wings and his own hands reenforcing that\r\nimpregnable covering over his head and neck, threw all his power into\r\nhis tail--tightening, with terrific, rippling surges, that already\r\nthrottling band about the throat of his opponent. Only one result was\r\npossible. Soon Zerexi lay quiet, and a violet beam of light flared from\r\na torch at the ringside, bathing both contenders. At the flash the\r\nwinner disengaged himself from the loser, and stood by until the latter\r\nhad recovered the use of his paralyzed muscles. The two combatants then\r\ntouched wing tips in salute and flew away together, over the heads of\r\nthe crowd; plunging into a doorway and disappearing as the two officers\r\nuncoiled from their \"seats\" and wriggled out into the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Fine piece of contact work,\" said Wixill, thoughtfully. \"I'm glad that\r\nSintris won, but I did not expect him to win so easily. Zerexi shouldn't\r\nhave gone into a knot so early against such a fast man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" argued Kromodeor. \"His big mistake was in that\r\nsecond body check. If he had blocked the sixth arm with his fifth, taken\r\nout the fourth and second with his third, and then gone in with....\" and\r\nso, quite like two early experts after a good boxing match, the friends\r\nargued the fine points of the contest long after they had reached their\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nDay after day the vast duplex cone of Vorkulian fortresses sped\r\ntoward the north pole of the great planet, with a high and constant\r\nvelocity. Day after day the complex geometrical figure in space remained\r\nunchanged, no unit deviating measurably from its precise place in the\r\nformation. Over rapacious jungles, over geysers spouting hot water,\r\nover sullenly steaming rivers and seas, over boiling lakes of mud, and\r\nhigh over gigantic volcanoes, in uninterrupted eruptions of cataclysmic\r\nviolence, the Vorkulian phalanx flew--straight north. The equatorial\r\nregions, considerably hotter than the poles, were traversed with\r\npractically no change in scenery--it was a world of steaming fog,\r\nof jungle, of hot water, of boiling, spurting mud, and of volcanoes.\r\nNot of such mild and sporadic volcanic outbreaks as we of green Terra\r\nknow, but of gigantic primordial volcanoes, in terrifyingly continuous\r\nperformances of frightful intensity. Due north the Vorkulian spearhead\r\nwas hurled, before the rigorous geometrical alignment was altered.\r\n\r\n\"All captains, attention!\" Finally, in a high latitude, the flagship\r\nsent out final instructions. \"The hexans have detected us and our long\r\nrange observers report that they are coming to meet us in force. We will\r\nnow go into the whirl, and proceed with the maneuvers exactly as they\r\nhave been planned. Whirl!\"\r\n\r\nAt the command, each vessel began to pursue a tortuous spiral path.\r\nEach group of seven circled slowly about its own axis, as though each\r\nstructure were attached rigidly to a radius rod, and at the same time\r\nspiraled around the line of advance in such fashion that the whole\r\ngigantic cone, wide open maw to the fore, seemed to be boring its way\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky again!\" Kromodeor, in the wardroom, turned to Wixill as the two\r\nprepared to take their respective watches. \"It looks as though the first\r\naction would come while we're on duty. I've got just one favor to ask,\r\nif you have to economize on power, let Number One alone, will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of that,\" Wixill hissed, with the Vorkulian equivalent of a\r\nchuckle. \"We have abundance of power for all of your projector officers.\r\nBut don't waste any of it, or I'll cut you down five ratings!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome. When I shine old Number One on any hexan work, one\r\nflash is all we'll take. See you at supper,\" and, leaving his superior\r\nat the door of the power room, Kromodeor wriggled away to his station\r\nupon the parallel horizontal bars before his panel.\r\n\r\nMaking sure that his tail coils were so firmly clamped that no possible\r\nlurch or shock could throw him out of position, he set an eye toward\r\neach of his sighting screens, even though he knew that it would be long\r\nbefore those comparatively short range instruments would show anything\r\nexcept friendly vessels. Then, ready for any emergency, he scanned his\r\none \"live\" screen--the one upon which were being flashed the pictures\r\nand reports secured by the high-powered instruments of the observers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the terrific acceleration employed by the hexan spheres, it\r\nwas not long until the leading squadron of fighting globes neared\r\nthe Vorkulian war-cone. This advance guard was composed of the new,\r\nhigh-acceleration vessels. Their crews, with the innate blood-lust\r\nand savagery of their breed, had not even entertained the thought of\r\naccommodating their swifter pace to that of the main body of the fleet.\r\nThese vast, slow-moving structures were no more to be feared than those\r\nsimilar ones whose visits they had been repulsing for twenty long\r\nJovian years--by the time the slower spheres could arrive upon the scene\r\nthere would be nothing left for them to do. Therefore, few in number\r\nas were the vessels of the vanguard, they rushed to the attack. In one\r\nblinding salvo they launched their supposedly irresistible planes of\r\nforce--dazzling, scintillating planes under whose fierce power the\r\nstudying, questing, scouting fortresses previously encountered had fled\r\nback southward; cut, beaten, and crippled. These spiraling monsters,\r\nhowever, did not pause or waver in their stolidly ordered motion.\r\nAs the hexan planes of force flashed out, the dull green metal walls\r\nbroke into a sparkling green radiance, against which the Titanic\r\nbolts spent themselves in vain. Then there leaped out from the weird\r\nbrilliance of the walls of the fortresses great shafts of pale green\r\nluminescence--tractor ray after gigantic tractor ray, which seized\r\nupon the hexan spheres and drew them ruthlessly into the yawning\r\nopen end of that gigantic cone.\r\n\r\nThen, in each group of seven, similar great streamers of energy reached\r\nout from fortress to fortress, until each group was welded into one\r\nmighty unit by twenty-one such bands of force. The unit formed, a ray\r\nfrom each of its seven component structures seized upon a designated\r\nsphere, and under the combined power of those seven tractors, the\r\nluckless globe was literally snapped into the center of mass of the\r\nVorkulian unit. There seven dully gleaming red pressor rays leaped upon\r\nit, backed by all the power of seven gigantic fortresses, held rigidly\r\nin formation by the unimaginable mass of the structures and by their\r\ntwenty-one prodigious tractor beams. Under that awful impact, the\r\nscreens and walls of the hexan spheres were exactly as effective as so\r\nmany structures of the most tenuous vapor. The red glare of the vortex\r\nof those beams was lightened momentarily by a flash of brighter color,\r\nand through the foggy atmosphere there may have flamed briefly a drop or\r\ntwo of metal that was only liquefied. The red and green beams snapped\r\nout, the peculiar radiance died from the metal walls, and the gigantic\r\nduplex cone of the Vorkuls bored serenely northward--as little marked or\r\naffected by the episode as is a darting swift who, having snapped up a\r\nchance insect in full flight, darts on.\r\n\r\n\"Great Cat!\" Far off in space, Brandon turned from his visiray screen\r\nand wiped his brow. \"Czuv certainly chirped it, Perce, when he called\r\nthose things flying fortresses. But who, what, why, and how? We didn't\r\nsee any apparatus that looked capable of generating or handling those\r\nbeams--and of course, when they got started, their screens cut us\r\noff at the pockets. Wish we could have made some sense out of their\r\nlanguage--like to know a few of their ideas--find out whether we can't\r\nget on terms with them some way or other. Funny-looking wampuses, but\r\nthey've got real brains--their think-tanks are very evidently full of\r\nbubbles. If they have it in mind to take us on next, old son, it'll be\r\njust ... too ... bad!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then some,\" agreed Stevens. \"They've got something--no fooling. It\r\nlooks like the hexans are going to get theirs, good and plenty, pretty\r\nsoon--and then what? I'd give my left lung and four front teeth for one\r\nlong look at their controls in action.\"\r\n\r\n\"You and me both--it's funny, the way those green ray-screens stick to\r\nthe walls, instead of being spherical, as you'd expect ... should think\r\nthey'd _have_ to radiate from a center, and so be spherical,\" Brandon\r\ncogitated. \"However, we've got nothing corkscrewy enough to go through\r\nthem, so we'll have to stand by. We'll stay inside whenever possible,\r\nlook on from outside when we must, but all the time picking up whatever\r\ninformation we can. In the meantime, now that we've got our passengers,\r\nold Doctor Westfall prescribes something that he says is good for what\r\nails us. Distance--lots of distance, straight out from the sun--and\r\nI wouldn't wonder if we'd better take his prescription.\"\r\n\r\nThe two Terrestrial observers relapsed into silence, staring into\r\ntheir visiray plates, searching throughout the enormous volume of one\r\nof those great fortresses in another attempt to solve the mystery of the\r\ngeneration and propagation of the incredible manifestations of energy\r\nwhich they had just witnessed. Scarcely had the search begun, however,\r\nwhen the visirays were again cut off sharply--the rapidly advancing main\r\nfleet of the hexans had arrived and the scintillant Vorkulian screens\r\nwere again in place.\r\n\r\nTrue to hexan nature, training and tradition, the fleet, hundreds\r\nstrong, rushed savagely to the attack. Above, below, and around the\r\nfar-flung cone the furious globes dashed, attacking every Vorkulian\r\ncraft viciously with every resource at their command; with every weapon\r\nknown to their diabolically destructive race. Planes of force stabbed\r\nand slashed, concentrated beams of annihilation flared fiercely through\r\nthe reeking atmosphere, gigantic aerial bombs and torpedoes were hurled\r\nwith full radio control against the unwelcome visitor--with no effect.\r\nBound together in groups of seven by the mighty, pale-green bands of\r\nforce, the Vorkulian units sailed calmly northward, spiraling along with\r\nnot the slightest change in formation or velocity. The frightful planes\r\nand beams of immeasurable power simply spent themselves harmlessly\r\nagainst those sparklingly radiant green walls--seemingly as absorbent\r\nto energy as a sponge is to water, since the eye could not detect any\r\nchange in the appearance of the screens, under even the fiercest blasts\r\nof the hexan projectors. Bombs, torpedoes, and all material projectiles\r\nwere equally futile--they exploded harmlessly in the air far from their\r\nobjectives, or disappeared at the touch of one of those dark, dull-red\r\npressor rays. And swiftly, but calmly and methodically as at a Vorkulian\r\npractice drill, the heptagons were destroying the hexan fleet. Seven\r\nmighty green tractors would lash out, seize an attacking sphere, and\r\nsnap it into the center of mass of the unit of seven. There would be a\r\nbrief flash of dull red, a still briefer flare of incandescence, and the\r\nimpalpable magnets would leap out to seize another of the doomed globes.\r\nIt was only a matter of moments until not a hexan vessel remained; and\r\nthe Vorkulian juggernaut spiraled onward, now at full acceleration,\r\ntoward the hexan stronghold dimly visible far ahead of them--a vast\r\ncity built around Jupiter's northern pole.\r\n\r\nAt the controls of his projector, Kromodeor spun a dial with a\r\nmany-fingered, flexible hand and spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Wixill, I am being watched again--I can feel very plainly that strange\r\nintelligence watching everything I do. Have the tracers located him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they haven't been able to synchronize with his wave yet. Either\r\nhe is using a most minute pencil or, what is more probable, he is on a\r\nfrequency which we do not ordinarily use. However, I agree with you that\r\nit is not a malignant intelligence. All of us have felt it, and none of\r\nus senses enmity. Therefore, it is not a hexan--it may be one of those\r\nstrange creatures of the satellites, who are, of course, perfectly\r\nharmless.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harmless, but unpleasant,\" returned Kromodeor. \"When we get back I'm\r\ngoing to find his beam myself and send a discharge along it that will\r\nend his spying upon me. I do not....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA wailing signal interrupted the conversation and every Vorkul in\r\nthe vast fleet coiled even more tightly about his bars, for the real\r\nbattle was about to begin. The city of the hexans lay before them,\r\nall her gigantic forces mustered to repel the first real invasion of\r\nher long and warlike history. Mile after mile it extended, an orderly\r\nlabyrinth of spherical buildings arranged in vast interlocking series\r\nof concentric circles--a city of such size that only a small part of it\r\nwas visible, even to the infra-red vision of the Vorkulians. Apparently\r\nthe city was unprotected, having not even a wall. Outward from the low,\r\nrounded houses of the city's edge there reached a wide and verdant\r\nplain, which was separated from the jungle by a narrow moat of\r\nshimmering liquid--a liquid of such dire potency that across it,\r\neven those frightful growths could neither leap nor creep.\r\n\r\nBut as the Vorkulian phalanx approached--now shooting forward and\r\nupward with maximum acceleration, screaming bolts of energy flaming out\r\nfor miles behind each heptagon as the full power of its generators was\r\nunleashed--it was made clear that the homeland of the hexans was far\r\nfrom unprotected. The verdant plain disappeared in a blast of radiance,\r\nrevealing a transparent surface, through which could be seen masses of\r\nmachinery filling level below level, deep into the ground as far as the\r\neye could reach; and from the bright liquid of the girdling moat there\r\nshot vertically upward a coruscantly refulgent band of intense yellow\r\nluminescence. These were the hexan defences, heretofore invulnerable and\r\ninvincible. Against them any ordinary warcraft, equipped with ordinary\r\nweapons of offense, would have been as pitifully impotent as a naked\r\nbaby attacking a battleship. But now those defenses were being\r\nchallenged by no ordinary craft; it had taken the mightiest intellects\r\nof Vorkulia two long lifetimes to evolve the awful engine of destruction\r\nwhich was hurling itself forward and upward with an already terrific and\r\nconstantly increasing speed.\r\n\r\nOnward and upward flashed the gigantic duplex cone, its entire whirling\r\nmass laced and latticed together--into one mammoth unit by green tractor\r\nbeams and red pressors. These tension and compression members, of\r\nunheard-of power, made of the whole fleet of three hundred forty-three\r\nfortresses a single stupendous structure--a structure with all the\r\nstrength and symmetry of a cantilever truss! Straight through that wall\r\nof yellow vibrations the vast truss drove, green walls flaming blue\r\ndefiance as the absorbers overloaded; its doubly braced tip rearing\r\nupward, into and beyond the vertical as it shot through that searing\r\nyellow wall. Simultaneously from each heptagon there flamed downward a\r\ngreen shaft of radiance, so that the whole immense circle of the cone's\r\nmouth was one solid tractor beam, fastening upon and holding in an\r\nunbreakable grip mile upon mile of the hexan earthworks.\r\n\r\nPractically irresistible force and supposedly immovable object!\r\nEvery loose article in every heptagon had long since been stored in\r\nits individual shockproof compartment, and now every Vorkul coiled his\r\nentire body in fierce clasp about mighty horizontal bars: for the entire\r\nkinetic energy of the untold millions of tons of mass comprising the\r\ncone, at the terrific measure of its highest possible velocity, was\r\nto be hurled upon those unbreakable linkages of force which bound\r\nthe trussed aggregation of Vorkulian fortresses to the deeply buried\r\nintrenchments of the hexans. The gigantic composite tractor beam snapped\r\non and held. Inconceivably powerful as that beam was, it stretched a\r\ntrifle under the incomprehensible momentum of those prodigious masses\r\nof metal, almost halted in their terrific flight. But the war-cone was\r\nnot quite halted; the calculations of the Vorkulian scientists had been\r\naccurate. No possible artificial structure, and but few natural ones--in\r\npractice maneuvers entire mountains had been lifted and hurled for miles\r\nthrough the air--could have withstood the incredible violence of that\r\nlunging, twisting, upheaving impact. Lifted bodily by that impalpable\r\nhawser of force and cruelly wrenched and twisted by its enormous couple\r\nof angular momentum, the hexan works came up out of the ground as a\r\nwaterpipe comes up in the teeth of a power shovel. The ground trembled\r\nand rocked and boulders, fragments of concrete masonry, and masses of\r\nmetal flew in all directions as that city-encircling conduit of\r\ndiabolical machinery was torn from its bed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA portion of that conduit fully thirty miles in length was in the air,\r\na twisted, flaming inferno of wrecked generators, exploding ammunition,\r\nand broken and short-circuited high-tension leads before the hexans\r\ncould themselves cut it and thus save the remainder of their\r\nfortifications. With resounding crashes, the structure parted at the\r\nweakened points, the furious upheaval stopped and, the tractor beams\r\nshut off, the shattered, smoking, erupting mass of wreckage fell in\r\nclashing, grinding ruin upon the city.\r\n\r\nThe enormous duplex cone of the Vorkuls did not attempt to repeat the\r\nmaneuver, but divided into two single cones, one of which darted toward\r\neach point of rupture. There, upon the broken and unprotected ends of\r\nthe hexan cordon, their points of attack lay: theirs the task to eat\r\nalong that annular fortress, no matter what the opposition might bring\r\nto bear--to channel in its place a furrow of devastation until the two\r\ncones, their work complete, should meet at the opposite edge of the\r\ncity. Then what was left of the cones would separate into individual\r\nheptagons, which would so systematically blast every hexan thing into\r\nnothingness as to make certain that never again would they resume their\r\ninsensate attacks upon the Vorkuls. Having counted the cost and being\r\ngrimly ready to pay it, the implacable attackers hurled themselves upon\r\ntheir objectives.\r\n\r\nHere were no feeble spheres of space, commanding only the limited\r\nenergies transmitted to their small receptors through the ether. Instead\r\nthere were all the offensive and defensive weapons developed by hundreds\r\nof generations of warrior-scientists; wielding all the incalculable\r\npower capable of being produced by the massed generators of a mighty\r\nnation. But for the breach opened in the circle by the irresistible\r\nsurprise attack, they would have been invulnerable, and, hampered as\r\nthey were by the defenseless ends of what should have been an endless\r\nring, the hexans took heavy toll.\r\n\r\nThe heptagons, massive and solidly braced as they were, and anchored by\r\ntractor rays as well, shuddered and trembled throughout their mighty\r\nframes under the impact of fiercely driven pressor beams. Sullenly\r\nradiant green wall-screens flared brighter and brighter as the Vorkulian\r\nabsorbers and dissipators, mighty as they were, continued more and more\r\nto overload; for there were being directed against them beams from the\r\nentire remaining circumference of the stronghold. Every deadly frequency\r\nand emanation known to the fiendish hexan intellect, backed by the full\r\npower of the city, was poured out against the invaders in sizzling\r\nshrieking bars, bands, and planes of frenzied incandescence. Nor was\r\nvibratory destruction alone. Armor-piercing projectiles of enormous\r\nsize and weight were hurled--diamond-hard, drill-headed projectiles\r\nwhich clung and bored upon impact. High-explosive shells, canisters of\r\ngas, and the frightful aerial bombs and radio-dirigible torpedoes of\r\nhighly scientific war--all were thrown with lavish hand, as fast as\r\nthe projectors could be served. But thrust for thrust, ray for ray,\r\nprojectile for massive projectile, the Brobdingnagian creations of\r\nthe Vorkuls gave back to the hexans.\r\n\r\nThe material lining of the ghastly moat was the only substance capable\r\nof resisting the action of its contents, and now, that lining destroyed\r\nby the uprooting of the fortress, that corrosive, brilliantly mobile\r\nliquid cascaded down in to the trough and added its hellish contribution\r\nto the furious scene. For whatever that devouring fluid touched flared\r\ninto yellow flame, gave off clouds of lurid, strangling vapor, and\r\ndisappeared. But through yellow haze, through blasting frequencies,\r\nthrough clouds of poisonous gas, through rain of metal and through\r\nstorm of explosive the two cones ground implacably onward, their every\r\noffensive weapon centered upon the fast-receding exposed ends of the\r\nhexan fortress. Their bombs and torpedoes ripped and tore into the\r\nstructure beneath the invulnerable shield and exploded, demolishing\r\nand hurling aside like straws, the walls, projectors, hexads and vast\r\nmountains of earth. Their terrible rays bored in, softening, fusing,\r\nvolatilizing metal, short-circuiting connections, destroying life\r\nfar ahead of the point of attack; and, drawn along by the relentlessly\r\ncreeping composite tractor beam, there progressed around the circumference\r\nof the hexan city two veritable Saturnalia of destruction--uninterrupted,\r\ncataclysmic detonations of sound and sizzling, shrieking, multi-colored\r\ndisplays of pyrotechnic incandescence combining to form a spectacle\r\nof violence incredible.\r\n\r\nBut the heptagons could not absorb nor radiate indefinitely those\r\ntorrents of energy, and soon one greenishly incandescent screen went\r\ndown. Giant shells pierced the green metal walls, giant beams of force\r\nfused and consumed them. Faster and faster the huge heptagon became a\r\nshapeless, flowing mass, its metal dripping away in flaming gouts of\r\nbrilliance; then it disappeared utterly in one terrific blast as some\r\nprobing enemy ray reached a vital part. The cone did not pause nor\r\nwaver. Many of its component units would go down, but it would go\r\non--and on and on until every hexan trace had disappeared or until\r\nthe last Vorkulian heptagon had been annihilated.\r\n\r\nIn one of the lowermost heptagons, one bearing the full brunt of the\r\nhexan armament, Kromodeor reared upright as his projector controls\r\nwent dead beneath his hands. Finding his communicator screens likewise\r\nlifeless, he slipped to the floor and wriggled to the room of the Chief\r\nPower Officer, where he found Wixill idly fingering his controls.\r\n\r\n\"Are we out?\" asked Kromodeor, tersely.\r\n\r\n\"All done,\" the Chief Power Officer calmly replied. \"We have power left,\r\nbut we cannot use it, as they have crushed our screens and are fusing\r\nour outer walls. Two out of seven chances, and we drew one of them. We\r\nare still working on the infra band, over across on the Second's board,\r\nbut we won't last long....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the mighty fabric lurched under them, and only their quick\r\nand powerful tails, darting in lightning loops about the bars, saved\r\nthem from being battered to death against the walls as the heptagon was\r\nhurled end over end by a stupendous force. With a splintering crash it\r\ncame to rest upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how that happened? They should have rayed us out or exploded\r\nus,\" Kromodeor pondered. The Vorkuls, with their inhumanly powerful,\r\nsinuous bodies, were scarcely affected by the shock of that frightful\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\"They must have had a whole battery of pressors on us when our greens\r\nwent out--they threw us half-way across the city, almost into the gate\r\nwe made first,\" Wixill replied, studying the situation of the vessel in\r\nthe one small screen still in action. \"We aren't hurt very badly--only a\r\nfew holes that they are starting to weld already. When the absorber and\r\ndissipator crews get them cooled down enough so that we can use power\r\nagain, we'll go back.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were not to resume their place in the attack. Through the\r\nholes in the still-glowing walls, hexan soldiery were leaping in\r\nsteady streams, fighting with the utmost savagery of their bloodthirsty\r\nnatures, urged on by the desperation born of the knowledge of imminent\r\ndefeat and total destruction. Hand-weapons roared, flashed, and\r\nsparkled; heavy bars crashed and thudded against crunching bones;\r\nmighty bodies and tails whipped crushingly about six-limbed forms which\r\nwrenched and tore with monstrously powerful hands and claws. Fiercely\r\nand valiantly the Vorkuls fought, but they were outnumbered by hundreds\r\nand only one outcome was possible.\r\n\r\nKromodeor was one of the last to go down. Weapons long since exhausted,\r\nhe unwrapped his deadly coils from about a dead hexan and darted toward\r\na storeroom, only to be cut off by a horde of enemies. Throwing himself\r\ndown a vertical shaft, he flew toward a tiny projector-locker, in the\r\nlowermost part of one of the great star's points, the hexans in hot\r\npursuit. He wrenched the door open, and even while searing planes of\r\nforce were riddling his body, he trained the frightful weapon he had\r\nsought. He pressed the contact, and bursts of intolerable flame swept\r\nthe entire passage clear of life. Weakly he struggled to go out into the\r\naisle, but his muscles refused to do the bidding of his will and he lay\r\nthere, twitching feebly.\r\n\r\nIn the power room of the heptagon a hexan officer turned fiercely to\r\nanother, who was offering advice.\r\n\r\n\"Vorkuls? Bah!\" he snarled, viciously. \"Our race is finished. Die we\r\nmust, but we shall take with us the one enemy, who above all others\r\nneeds destruction!\" and he hurled the captured Vorkulian fortress into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nAs the heptagon lurched upward, the massive door of a lower projector\r\nlocker clanged shut and Kromodeor collapsed in a corner, his\r\nconsciousness blotted out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Well, that certainly tears it! That's a ... I....\" Stevens' ready\r\nvocabulary failed him and he turned to Brandon, who was still staring\r\nnarrow-eyed into the plate, watching the destruction of the hexan city.\r\n\r\n\"They've got something, all right--you've got to hand it to them,\"\r\nBrandon replied. \"And we thought we knew something about forces and\r\nphysical phenomena in general. Those birds have forgotten more than we\r\never will know. Just one of those things could take the whole I-P fleet,\r\narmed as we are now, any morning before breakfast, just for setting-up\r\nexercises. We've got to do something about it--but what?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's okay--whatever you say. There may be an out somewhere, but I don't\r\nsee it,\" and Stevens' gloomy tone matched his words.\r\n\r\nHighly trained scientists both, they had been watching that which\r\ntranscended all the science of the inner planets and knew themselves\r\noutclassed immeasurably.\r\n\r\n\"Only one thing to do, as I see it,\" Brandon cogitated. \"That's to keep\r\non going straight out, the way we're headed now. We'd better call a\r\ncouncil of war, to dope out a line of action.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe Citadel in Space\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the first time in many days Brandon and Westfall sat at dinner in\r\nthe main dining room of the _Sirius_. They were enjoying greatly the\r\nunaccustomed pleasure of a leisurely, formal meal; but still their\r\ntalk concerned the projection of pure forces instead of subjects more\r\nappropriate to the table; still their eyes paid more attention to\r\ndiagrams drawn upon scraps of paper than to the diners about them.\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you, Quince, you're full of little red ants, clear to the\r\nneck!\" Brandon snorted, as Westfall waved one of his arguments aside.\r\n\"You must have had help to get that far off--no one man could possibly\r\nbe as wrong as you are. Why, those fields absolutely will....\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Quincy! Hi, Norman!\" a merry voice interrupted. \"Still fighting as\r\nusual, I see! What kind of knights are you, anyway, to rescue us poor\r\ndamsels in distress, and then never even know that we're alive?\" A tall,\r\nwillowy brunette had seen the two physicists as she entered the saloon,\r\nand came over to their table, a hand outstretched to each in cordial\r\ngreeting.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, Verna!\" both men exclaimed, and came to their feet as they welcomed\r\nthe smiling, graceful newcomer.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down here, Verna--we have hardly started,\" Westfall invited, and\r\nBrandon looked at the girl in assumed surprise as she seated herself in\r\nthe proffered chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Verna, it's like this....\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"That's enough!\" she broke in. \"That phrase always was your introduction\r\nto one of the world's greatest brainstorms. But I know that this is the\r\nfirst time you have had time even to eat like civilized beings, so I'll\r\nforgive you this once. Why all the registering of amazement, Norman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm astonished that you aren't being monopolized by some husband or\r\nother. Surely the officers of the _Arcturus_ weren't so dumb that they'd\r\nstand for your still being Verna _Pickering_, were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not dumb, Norman, no. Far from it. But I'm still working for my\r\nM. R. S. degree, and I haven't succeeded in snaring it yet. You'd be\r\nsurprised at how cagy those officers got after a few of them had been\r\ncaptured. But they are just like any other hunted game, I suppose--the\r\nantelopes that survive get pretty wild, you know,\" she concluded,\r\nplaintively.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that certainly is one tough break for a poor little girl,\"\r\nBrandon sympathized. \"Quince, our little Nell, here, hasn't been done\r\nright by. I'm bashful and you're a woman-hater, but between us, some\r\nway, we've simply got to take steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might take longer steps than you think,\" Verna laughed, her\r\nregular, white teeth and vivid coloring emphasized by her olive skin\r\nand her startling hair, black as Brandon's own. \"Perhaps I would like\r\na scientist better than an I-P officer, anyway. The more I think of it,\r\nthe surer I am that Nadia Newton had the right idea. I believe that\r\nI'll catch me a physicist, too--either of you would do quite nicely,\r\nI think,\" and she studied the two men carefully.\r\n\r\nWestfall, the methodical and precise, had never been able to defend\r\nhimself against Verna Pickering's badinage, but Brandon's ready tongue\r\ntook up the challenge.\r\n\r\n\"Verna, if you really decided to get any living man he wouldn't stand a\r\nchance in the world,\" he declared. \"If you've already made up your mind\r\nthat I'm your meat, I'll come down like Davy Crockett's coon. But if\r\neither of us will do, that'll give us each a fifty-fifty chance to\r\nescape your toils. What say we play a game of freeze-out to decide it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine, Norman! When shall we play?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, between Wednesday and Thursday, any week you say,\" and the two\r\nfenced on, banteringly but skilfully, with Westfall an appreciative and\r\nunembarrassed listener.\r\n\r\nDinner over, Brandon and Westfall went back to the control room, where\r\nthey found Stevens already seated at one of the master screens.\r\n\r\n\"All x, Perce?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x. The observers report no registrations during the last two\r\nwatches,\" and the three fell into discussion. Long they talked, studying\r\nevery angle of the situation confronting them; until suddenly a speaker\r\nrattled furiously and an enormous, staring eye filled both master\r\nplates. Brandon's hand flashed to a switch, but the image disappeared\r\neven before he could establish the full-coverage ray screen.\r\n\r\n\"I'm on the upper band--take the lower!\" he snapped, but Stevens'\r\nprojector was already in action. Trained minds all, they knew that some\r\nintelligence had traced them, and all realized that it was of the utmost\r\nimportance to know what and where that intelligence was. Stevens found\r\nthe probing frequency in his range and they flashed their own beam along\r\nit, encountering finally one of the monstrous Vorkulian fortresses, far\r\nfrom Jupiter and almost directly between them and the planet! Its wall\r\nscreens were in operation, and no frequency at their command could\r\npenetrate that neutralizing blanket of vibrations.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of an eye was that--ever see anything like it, Perce?\"\r\nBrandon demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so, though of course we got only an awfully short flash\r\nof it. It didn't look like the periscopic eyes that those flying snakes\r\nhad--looked more like a hexan eye, don't you think? Couldn't very well\r\nbe hexan, though, in that kind of a ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think so, either. Maybe it's a purely mechanical affair that they\r\nuse for observing. Anyway, old sons, I don't like the looks of things at\r\nall. Quince, you're the brains of this outfit--shift the massive old\r\nintellect into high and tell us what to do.\"\r\n\r\nWestfall, staring into the eyepiece of the filar micrometer, finished\r\nmeasuring the apparent size of the heptagon before he turned toward\r\nStevens and Brandon.\r\n\r\n\"It is hard to decide upon a course of action, since anything that we\r\ndo may prove to be wrong,\" he said, slowly. \"However, I do not see that\r\nthis latest development can operate to change the plan we have already\r\nadopted; that of running away, straight out from the sun. We may have\r\nto increase our acceleration to the highest value the women and babies\r\ncan stand. A series of observations of our pursuer will, of course, be\r\nnecessary to decide that point. It would be useless to go to Titan,\r\nfor they would be powerless to help us. We could not hold their mirror\r\nupon either the _Sirius_ or their torpedoes against such forces as that\r\nfortress has at her command. Then, too, we might well be bringing down\r\nupon them an enemy who would destroy much of their world before he could\r\nbe stopped. Both Uranus and Neptune are approximately upon our present\r\ncourse. Do the Titanians know anything of either of them, Steve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing,\" the computer replied. \"They can't get nearly as far as\r\nUranus on their power beam--it's all they can do to make Jupiter. They\r\nseem to think, though, that one or more of the satellites of Uranus or\r\nNeptune may be inhabited by beings similar to themselves, only perhaps\r\neven more so. But considering the difference between what we found on\r\nthe Jovian satellites and on Titan, I'd say that anything might be out\r\nthere--on Uranus, Neptune, their satellites, or anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cancel Uranus, and double that for Neptune,\" Brandon commanded.\r\n\"Realize how far away they are?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right, too,\" agreed Stevens. \"Before we got there, with any\r\nacceleration we can use now, this whole mess will be cleaned up, one way\r\nor the other.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWestfall completed the series of observations and calculated his\r\nresults. Then, with a grave face, he went to consult the medical\r\nofficers. The women, children, and the two Martian scientists were sent\r\nto the sick-bay and the acceleration was raised slowly to twenty meters\r\nper second per second, above which point the physicians declared they\r\nshould not go unless it became absolutely necessary. Then the scientists\r\nmet again--met without Alcantro and Fedanzo, who lay helpless upon\r\nnarrow hospital bunks, unable even to lift their massive arms.\r\n\r\nWhile Westfall made another series of precise measurements of the\r\nsuper-dreadnought of space so earnestly pursuing them, Brandon stumbled\r\nheavily about the room, hands jammed deep into pockets, eyes unseeing\r\nemitting clouds of smoke from his villainously reeking pipe. The\r\nVenetians, lacking Brandon's physical strength and by nature quieter of\r\ndisposition, sat motionless; keen minds hard at work. Stevens sat at the\r\ncalculating machine, absently setting up and knocking down weird and\r\nmeaningless integrals, while he also concentrated upon the problem\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"They are still gaining, but comparatively slowly,\" Westfall finally\r\nreported. \"They seem to be....\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case we may be all x,\" Brandon interrupted, brandishing his\r\npipe vigorously. \"We know that they're on a beam--apparently we're the\r\nonly ones hereabouts having cosmic power. If we can keep away from them\r\nuntil their beam attenuates, we can whittle 'em down to our size and\r\nthen take them, no matter how much accumulator capacity they've got.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can we keep away from them that long?\" asked Dol Kenor, pointedly;\r\nand his fellow Venerian also had a question to propound:\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be preferable to lead them in a wide circle, back to a\r\nrendezvous with the Space Fleet, which will probably be ready by the\r\ntime of meeting?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that that would be useless,\" Westfall frowned in thought.\r\n\"Given power, that fortress could destroy the entire Fleet almost as\r\neasily as she could wipe out the _Sirius_ alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kenor's right.\" Stevens spoke up from the calculator. \"You're getting\r\ntoo far ahead of the situation. We aren't apt to keep ahead of them long\r\nenough to do much leading anywhere. The Titanians can hold a beam\r\ntogether from Saturn to Jupiter--why can't these snake-folks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Several reasons,\" Brandon argued stubbornly. \"First place, look at the\r\nmass of that thing, and remember that the heavier the beam the harder\r\nit is to hold it together. Second, there's no evidence that they wander\r\naround much in space. If their beams are designed principally for travel\r\nupon Jupiter, why should they have any extraordinary range? I say they\r\ncan't hold that beam forever. We've got a good long lead, and in spite\r\nof their higher acceleration, I think we'll be able to keep out of range\r\nof their heavy stuff. If so, we'll trace a circle--only one a good deal\r\nbigger than the one Amonar suggested--and meet the fleet at a point\r\nwhere that enemy ship will be about out of power.\"\r\n\r\nThus for hours the scientists argued, agreeing upon nothing, while\r\nthe Vorkulian fortress crept ever closer. At the end of three days of\r\nthe mad flight, the pursuing space ship was in plain sight, covering\r\nhundreds of divisions of the micrometer screens. But now the size of\r\nthe images was increasing with extreme slowness, and the scientists\r\nof the _Sirius_ watched with strained attention the edges of those\r\nglowing green pictures. Finally, when the pictured edges were about\r\nto cease moving across the finely-ruled lines, Brandon cut down his\r\nown acceleration a trifle, and kept on decreasing it at such a rate\r\nthat the heptagon still crept up, foot by foot.\r\n\r\n\"Hey what's the big idea?\" Stevens demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Coax 'em along. If we run away from them they'll probably reverse power\r\nand go back home, won't they? Their beam is falling apart fast, but\r\nthey're still getting so much stuff along it that we couldn't do a thing\r\nto stop them. If they think that we're losing power even faster than\r\nthey are, though, they'll keep after us until their beam's so thin that\r\nthey'll just be able to stop on it. Then they'll reverse or else go onto\r\ntheir accumulators--reverse, probably, since they'll be a long ways from\r\nhome by that time. We'll reverse, too, and keep just out of range. Then,\r\nwhen we both have stopped and are about to start back, their beam will\r\nbe at its minimum and we'll go to work on 'em--foot, horse, and marines.\r\nNobody can run us as ragged as they've been doing and get away with it\r\nas long as I'm conscious and stand a chance in the world of hanging one\r\nonto their chins in retaliation. I've got a hunch. If it works, we can\r\ntake those birds alone, and take 'em so they'll _stay_ took. We might as\r\nwell break up--this is going to be an ordinary job of piloting for a few\r\ndays, I think. I'm going up and work with the Martians on that hunch.\r\nYou fellows work out any ideas you want to. Watch 'em close, Mac. Keep\r\nkidding 'em along, but don't let them get close enough to puncture us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverything worked out practically as Brandon had foretold, and a few\r\ndays later, their acceleration somewhat less than terrestrial gravity,\r\nhe called another meeting in the control room. He came in grinning from\r\near to ear, accompanied by the two Martians, and seated himself at his\r\ncomplex power panel.\r\n\r\n\"Now watch the professor closely, gentlemen,\" he invited. \"He is going\r\nto cut that beam.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't,\" protested Pyraz Amonar.\r\n\r\n\"I know you can't, ordinarily, when a beam is tight and solid. But\r\nthat beam's as loose as ashes right now. I told you I had a hunch, and\r\nAlcantro and Fedanzo worked out the right answer for me. If I can cut\r\nit, Quince, and if their screens go down for a minute, shoot your\r\nvisiray into them and see what you can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"All x. How much power are you going to draw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty--it figures a little better than four hundred thousand\r\nkilofranks. I'll draw it all from the accumulators, so as not to\r\ndisturb you fellows on the cosmic intake. We don't care if we do run the\r\nbatteries down some, but I don't want to hold that load on the bus-bars\r\nvery long. However, if my hunch is right, I won't be on that beam five\r\nminutes before it's cut from Jupiter--and I'll bet you four dollars that\r\nyou won't see the original crew in that fort when you get into it.\"\r\n\r\nHe set upper and lower bands of dirigible projectors to apply a\r\npowerful sidewise thrust, and the _Sirius_ darted off her course.\r\nFlashing a minute pencil behind the huge heptagon, Brandon manipulated\r\nhis tuning circuits until a brilliant spot in space showed him that he\r\nwas approaching resonance with the heptagon's power beam. Micrometer\r\ndials were then engaged and the delicate tuning continued until the\r\nmeters gave evidence that the two beams were precisely synchronized and\r\nexactly opposite in phase. Four plunger switches closed, that tiny pilot\r\nray became an enormous rod of force, and as those two gigantic beams met\r\nin exact opposition and neutralized each other, a solid wall of blinding\r\nbrilliance appeared in the empty ether behind the Vorkulian fortress. As\r\nthat dazzling wall sprang into being, the sparkling green protection\r\ndied from the walls of the heptagon.\r\n\r\n\"Go to it, Quince!\" Brandon yelled, but the suggestion was entirely\r\nsuperfluous. Even before the wall-screen had died, Westfall's beam was\r\ntrying to get through it, and when the visiray revealed the interior of\r\nthe heptagon, the quiet and methodical physicist was shaken from his\r\nhabitual calm.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they aren't the winged monsters at all--they're _hexans_!\"\r\nhe exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Sure they are.\" Brandon did not even turn his heavily-goggled eyes\r\nfrom the blazing blankness of his own screen. \"That was my hunch. Those\r\nsnakes went about things in a business-like fashion. They didn't strike\r\nme as being folks who would pull off such a wild stunt as trying to\r\nchase us clear out of the solar system, but a gang of hexans would do\r\njust that. Some of them must have captured that ship and, already having\r\nit in their cock-eyed brains that we were back of what happened on\r\nCallisto, they decided to bump us off if it was the last thing they ever\r\ndid. That's what I'd do myself, if I were a hexan. Now I'll tell you\r\nwhat's happening back at the home power plant of that ship and what's\r\ngoing to happen next. I'm kicking up a horrible row out there with my\r\ninterference, and a lot of instruments at the other end of that beam\r\nmust be cutting up all kinds of didoes, right now. They'll check up on\r\nthat ship with the expedition, by radio and what-not, and when they find\r\nout that it's clear out here--chop! Didn't get to see much, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they must have switched over to their accumulators almost\r\ninstantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but if they've got accumulator capacity enough to hold off our\r\nentire cosmic intake and get back to Jupiter besides, I'm a polyp! We're\r\ngoing to take that ship, fellows, and learn a lot of stuff we never\r\ndreamed of before. Ha! There goes his beam--pay me the four, Quince.\"\r\n\r\nThe dazzling wall of incandescence had blinked out without warning, and\r\nBrandon's beam bored on through space, unimpeded. He shut it off and\r\nturned to his fellows with a grin--a grin which disappeared instantly\r\nas a thought struck him and he leaped back to his board.\r\n\r\n\"Sound the high-acceleration warning quick, Perce!\" he snapped, and\r\ndrove in switch after switch.\r\n\r\n\"Cosmic intake's gone down to zero!\" exclaimed MacDonald, as the\r\n_Sirius_ leaped away.\r\n\r\n\"Had to cut it--they might shoot a jolt through that band. Just thought\r\nof something. Maybe unnecessary, but no harm done if ... it's necessary,\r\nall x--we're taking a sweet kissing right now. You see, even though\r\nwe're at pretty long range, they've got some horrible projectors, and\r\nthey were evidently mad enough to waste some power taking a good, solid\r\nflash at us--and if we hadn't been expecting it, that flash would have\r\nbeen a bountiful sufficiency, believe me--Great Cat! Look at that\r\nmeter--and I've had to throw in number ten shunt! The outer screen is\r\ndrawing five hundred and forty thousand!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey stared at the meter in amazement. It was incredible, even after\r\nthey had seen those heptagons in action, that at such extreme range\r\nany offensive beam could be driven with such unthinkable power--power\r\nrequiring for its neutralization almost the full output of the\r\nprodigious batteries of accumulators carried by the _Sirius_! Yet for\r\nfive, ten, fifteen, twenty minutes that beam drove furiously against\r\ntheir straining screens, and even Brandon's face grew tense and hard\r\nas that frightful attack continued. At the end of twenty-two minutes,\r\nhowever, the pointer of the meter snapped back to the pin and every\r\nman there breathed an explosive sigh of relief--the almost unbearable\r\nbombardment was over; the screen was drawing only its maintenance load.\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" Brandon shouted. \"I thought for a minute they were going to hang\r\nto us until we cracked, even if it meant that they'd have to freeze to\r\ndeath out here themselves!\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have meant that, too, don't you think?\" asked Stevens.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine so--don't see how they could possibly have enough power left\r\nto get back to Jupiter if they shine that thing on us much longer. Of\r\ncourse, the more power they waste on us, the quicker we can take them;\r\nbut I don't want much more of that beam, I'll tell the world--I just\r\nabout had heart failure before they cut off!\"\r\n\r\nThe massive heptagon was now drifting back toward Jupiter at constant\r\nvelocity. The hexans were apparently hoarding jealously their remaining\r\npower, for their wall screens did not flash on at the touch of the\r\nvisiray. Through unresisting metal the probing Terrestrial beams sped,\r\nand the scientists studied minutely every detail of the Vorkulian\r\narmament; while the regular observers began to make a detailed\r\nphotographic survey of every room and compartment of the great fortress.\r\nMuch of the instrumentation and machinery was familiar, but some of it\r\nwas so strange that study was useless--days of personal inspection and\r\nexperiment, perhaps complete dismantling, would be necessary to reveal\r\nthe secrets hidden within those peculiar mechanisms.\r\n\r\n\"They're trying to save all the power they can--think I'll make them\r\nspend some more,\" Brandon remarked, and directed against the heptagon a\r\nheavy destructive beam. \"We don't want them to get back to Jupiter until\r\nafter we've boarded them and found out everything we want to know. Come\r\nhere, Quince--what do you make of this?\"\r\n\r\nBoth men stared at the heptagon, frankly puzzled; for the screens of the\r\nstrange vessel did not radiate, nor did the material of the walls yield\r\nunder the terrible force of the beam. The destructive ray simply struck\r\nthat dull green surface and vanished--disappeared without a trace, as a\r\ntiny stream of water disappears into a partially-soaked sponge.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what you are doing?\" asked Westfall, after a few minutes'\r\nthought. \"I believe that you are charging their accumulators at the rate\r\nof,\" he glanced at a meter, \"exactly thirty-one thousand five hundred\r\nkilofranks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Cat!\" Brandon's hand flashed to a switch and the beam expired.\r\n\"But they can't just simply grab it and store it, Quince--it's\r\nimpossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"The word 'impossible' in that connection, coming from you, has a queer\r\nsound,\" Westfall said pointedly and Brandon actually blushed.\r\n\r\n\"That's right, too--we have got pretty much the same idea in our cosmic\r\nintake fields, but we didn't carry things half as far as they have done.\r\nHuh! They're flashing us again ... but those thin little beams don't\r\nmean anything. They're just trying to make us feed them some more, I\r\nguess. But we've got to hold them back some way--wonder if they can\r\nabsorb a tractor field?\"\r\n\r\nThe hexans had lashed out a few times with their lighter weapons,\r\nbut, finding the _Sirius_ unresponsive, had soon shut them off and were\r\nstolidly plunging along toward Jupiter. Brandon flung out a tractor rod\r\nand threw the mass of his cruiser upon it as it locked into those sullen\r\ngreen walls. But as soon as the enemy felt its drag, their screens\r\nflared white, and the massive Terrestrial space-ship quivered in every\r\nmember as that terrific cable of force was snapped.\r\n\r\n\"They apparently cannot store up the energy of a tractor,\" commented\r\nWestfall, \"but you will observe that they have no difficulty in\r\nradiating when they care to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those two ideas didn't pan out so heavy. There's lots of things not\r\ntried yet, though. Our next best bet is to get around in front of him\r\nand push back. If they wiggle away from more than fifty percent of a\r\npressor, they're really good.\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot maneuvered the _Sirius_ into line, directly between Jupiter\r\nand the pentagon; and as the driving projectors went into action,\r\nBrandon drove a mighty pressor field along their axis, squarely into the\r\ncenter of mass of the Vorkulian fortress. For a moment it held solidly,\r\nthen, as the screens of the enemy went into action, it rebounded and\r\nglanced off in sparkling, cascading torrents. But the hexans, with all\r\ntheir twisting and turning, could not present to that prodigious beam of\r\nforce any angle sufficiently obtuse to rob it of half its power, and the\r\ndriving projectors of the pentagon again burst into activity as the\r\nbackward-pushing mass of the _Sirius_ made itself felt. In a short time,\r\nhowever, the wall-screens were again cut off--apparently more power was\r\nrequired to drive them than they were able to deflect.\r\n\r\nAlthough even the enormous tonnage of the Terrestrial cruiser was\r\ninsignificant in comparison with the veritable mountain of metal to\r\nwhich she was opposed, so that the fiercest thrust of her driving\r\nprojectors did not greatly affect the monster's progress; yet Brandon\r\nand his cohorts were well content.\r\n\r\n\"It's a long trip back to where they came from, and since they wanted\r\nto drift all the way, I think they'll be out of power before they get\r\nthere,\" Brandon summed up the situation. \"We aren't losing any power,\r\neither, since we are using only a part of our cosmic intake.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few hours the struggle had settled down to a routine matter--the\r\n_Sirius_ being pushed backward steadily against the full drive of her\r\nevery projector, contesting stubbornly every mile of space traversed.\r\nAssured that the regular pilots and lookouts were fully capable\r\nof handling the vessel, the scientists were about to resume their\r\ninterrupted tasks when one of the photographers called them over to look\r\nat something he had discovered in one of the lowermost and smallest\r\ncompartments of the heptagon. All crowded around the screens, and saw\r\npictured there the winged, snake-like form of one of the original crew\r\nof the Vorkulian vessel!\r\n\r\n\"Dead?\" Brandon asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied the photographer. \"He is twitching a little once in\r\na while, but you see, he's pretty badly cut up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see he is ... he must have a lot of vitality to have lasted this\r\nlong--may be he'll live through it yet. Hold him on the plate, and get\r\nhis exact measurements.\" He turned to the communicator. \"Doctor von\r\nSteiffel? Can you come down to the control room a minute? We may want\r\nyou to operate upon one of these South Jovians after a while.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Himmel! Es ... ist ... der...._\" The great surgeon, bearded and\r\nmassive, stared into the plate, and in his surprise started to speak\r\nin his native German. He paused, his long, powerful fingers tracing the\r\nlikeness of the Vorkul upon the plate, then went on: \"I would like very\r\nmuch to operate, but, not understanding our intentions, he would, of\r\ncourse, struggle. And when that body struggles--_schrecklichkeit_!\" and\r\nhe waved his arms in a pantomime of wholesale destruction.\r\n\r\n\"I thought of that--that's why I am talking to you now instead of when\r\nwe get to him, two or three days from now. We'll give you his exact\r\nmeasurements, and a crew of mechanics will, under your direction, sink\r\nholes in the steel floor and install steel bands heavy enough to hold\r\nhim rigid, from tailfins to wing-tips. We'll hold him there until we can\r\nmake him understand that we're friends. It is of the utmost importance\r\nto save that creature's life if possible; because we do not want one of\r\ntheir fortresses launched against us--and in any event, it will not do\r\nus any harm to have a friend in the City of the South.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right. I will also have prepared some kind of a space-suit in which\r\nhe can be brought from his vessel to ours,\" and the surgeon took the\r\nmeasurements and went to see that the \"operating table\" and suit were\r\nmade ready for Kromodeor, the sorely wounded Vorkul.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was not long until the projectors of the heptagon went out and\r\nshe lay inert in space, power completely exhausted. Knowing that the\r\nscreens of the enemy would absorb any ordinary ray, the scientists had\r\ncalculated the most condensed beam they could possibly project, a beam\r\nwhich, their figures showed, should be able to puncture those screens by\r\nsheer mass action--puncture them practically instantaneously, before the\r\nabsorbers could react. To that end they had arranged their circuits to\r\nhurl seven hundred sixty-five thousand kilofranks--the entire power of\r\ntheir massed accumulators and their highest possible cosmic intake--in\r\none tiny bar of superlative density, less than one meter in diameter!\r\nEverything ready, Brandon shot in prodigious switches that launched that\r\nbolt--a bolt so vehement, so inconceivably intense, that it seemed\r\nfairly to blast the very ether out of existence as it tore its way along\r\nits carefully predetermined line. The intention was to destroy all the\r\ncontrol panels of the absorber screens; parts so vital that without them\r\nthe great vessel would be helpless, and yet items which the Terrestrials\r\ncould reconstruct quite readily from their photographs and drawings.\r\n\r\nAs that irresistible bolt touched the Vorkulian wall-screen, the spot\r\nof contact flared instantaneously through the spectrum and into the\r\nblack beyond the violet as that screen overloaded locally. Fast as it\r\nresponded and highly conductive though it was, it could not handle that\r\nfrightfully concentrated load. In the same fleeting instant of time\r\nevery molecule of substance in that beam's path flashed into tenuous\r\nvapor--no conceivable material could resist or impede that stabbing\r\nstiletto of energy--and the main control panel of the Vorkulian\r\nwall-screen system vanished. Time after time, as rapidly as he could\r\nsight his beam and operate his switches, Brandon drove his needle of\r\nannihilation through the fortress, destroying the secondary controls.\r\nThen, the walls unresisting, he cut in the vastly larger, but infinitely\r\nless powerful, I-P ray, and with it systematically riddled the immense\r\nheptagon. Out through the gaping holes in the outer walls rushed the\r\ndense atmosphere of Jupiter, and the hexans in their massed hundreds\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nThe _Sirius_ was brought up beside the heptagon, so that her main\r\nair-lock was against one of the yawning holes in the green metal wall\r\nof the enemy. There she was anchored by tractor beams, and the two\r\nhundred picked men of the I-P police, in full space equipment, prepared\r\nto board the gigantic fortress of the void. Brandon sat tense at his\r\ncontrols, ready to send his beam ahead of the troopers against any\r\nhexans that might survive in some as yet unpunctured compartment.\r\nGeneral Crowninshield sat beside the physicist at an auxiliary board,\r\nphones at ears and four infra-red visiray plates ranged in front of him;\r\nready through light or darkness to direct and oversee the attack, no\r\nmatter where it might lead or how widely separated the platoons might\r\nbecome before the citadel was taken.\r\n\r\nThe space-line men--the engineers of weightless combat--led the van,\r\nprotected by the projectors of their fellows. Theirs the task to set up\r\nways of rope, along which the others could advance. Power drills bit\r\nsavagely into metal, making holes to receive the expanding eyebolts;\r\ngrappling hooks seized fast every protuberance and corner; points of\r\nlittle stress were supported by powerful suction cups; and at intervals\r\nwere strung beam-fed lanterns, illuminating brilliantly the line of\r\nmarch. Through compartments and down corridors they went, bridging the\r\nmany gaps in the metal through which Brandon's beams had blasted their\r\nway; guided by Crowninshield along the shortest feasible path toward the\r\nlittle projector room in which Kromodeor, the wounded Vorkul, lay. There\r\nwere so many chambers and compartments in the heptagon that it had, of\r\ncourse, been impossible to puncture them all, and in some of the tight\r\nrooms were groups of hexans, anxious to do battle. But the general's eye\r\nled his men, and if such a room lay before them, Brandon's frightful\r\nbeam entered it first--and where that beam entered, life departed.\r\n\r\nBut the hexans were really intelligent, as has been said. They had had\r\ntime to prepare for what they knew awaited them, and they were rendered\r\nutterly desperate by the knowledge that, no matter what might happen,\r\ntheir course was run. Their power was gone, and even if the present\r\nenemy should be driven off, they would float idly in space until they\r\ndied of cold; or, more probably, hurtling toward Jupiter as they were,\r\nthey would plunge to certain death upon its surface as soon as they came\r\nwithin its powerful gravitational field. Therefore some fifty of the\r\ncreatures, who had had space experience in their spherical vessels,\r\nhad spent the preceding days in manufacturing space equipment. Let the\r\nweight-fiends plan upon detonating magazines of explosives, upon laying\r\nmines calculated to destroy the invaders, even the vessel itself and\r\nall within it. Let them plan upon any other such idle schemes, which\r\nwere certain to be foreseen and guarded against by the space-hardened\r\nveterans who undoubtedly moaned that all-powerful and vengeful football\r\nof scarred gray metal. Space-fighters were they, and as space-fighters\r\nwould they die; taking with them to their own inevitable death a full\r\nquota of the enemy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus it came about that the head of the column of police had scarcely\r\npassed a certain door, when in the room behind it there began to\r\nassemble the half-hundred spacehounds of the hexans. When the vanguard\r\nhad approached that room, Crowninshield had inspected it thoroughly with\r\nhis infra-red beams. He had found it punctured and airless, devoid of\r\nlife or of lethal devices, and had passed on. But now the space-suited\r\nwarriors of the horde, guided in their hiding by their own visirays,\r\nwere massing there. When the center of the I-P column reached that door,\r\nit burst open. There boiled out into the corridor, into the very midst\r\nof the police, fifty demoniacal hexans, fighting with Berserk fury,\r\nruled by but one impulse--to kill.\r\n\r\nHand-weapons flashed viciously, tearing at steel armor and at bulging\r\nspace-suits. Space-hooks bit and tore. Pikes and lances were driven with\r\nthe full power of brawny arms. Here and there could be seen trooper and\r\nhexan, locked together in fierce embrace far from any hand-line--six\r\nlimbs against four, all ten plied with abandon in mortal, hand-to-hand,\r\nfoot-to-foot combat.\r\n\r\n\"Give way!\" yelled Crowninshield into the ears of his men. \"Epstein,\r\nback! LeFevre, advance! Get out of block ten--give us a chance to use\r\na beam!\"\r\n\r\nAs the police fell back out of the designated section of the corridor,\r\nBrandon's beam tore through it, filling it from floor to ceiling with\r\na volume of intolerable energy. In that energy walls, doorway, and\r\nspace-lines, as well as most of the hexans, vanished utterly. But the\r\nbeam could not be used again. Every surviving enemy had hurled himself\r\nfrantically into the thickest ranks of the police and the battle raged\r\nfiercer than ever. It did not last long. The ends of the column had\r\nalready closed in. The police filled the corridor and overflowed into\r\nthe yawning chasm cut by the annihilating ray. Outnumbered, surrounded\r\nupon all sides, above, and below by the Terrestrials, the hexans fought\r\nwith mad desperation to the last man--and to the last man died. And even\r\nthough in lieu of their own highly efficient space-armor they had fought\r\nin weak, crude, and hastily improvised space-suits, which were pitifully\r\ninferior to the ray resistant, heavy steel armor of the I-P forces,\r\nnevertheless the enormous strength and utter savagery of the hexans had\r\ntaken toll; and when the advance was resumed, it was with extra lookouts\r\nscanning the entire neighborhood of the line of march.\r\n\r\nSince the troops had entered the fortress as close to their goal as\r\npossible, it was not long until the leading platoon reached the door\r\nbehind which Kromodeor lay. Tools and cylinders of air were brought up,\r\nand the engineers quickly fitted pressure bulkheads across the corridor.\r\nThere was a screaming hiss from the valves, the atmosphere in that\r\nwalled-off space became dense, and mechanics attacked with their power\r\ndrills the door of the projector room. It opened, and four husky\r\norderlies rapidly but gently encased the long body of the Vorkul in the\r\nspace-suit built especially to receive it. As that monstrous form in\r\nits weirdly bulging envelope was guided through the air-locks into the\r\n_Sirius_, Crowninshield barked orders into his transmitter and the\r\npolice reformed. They would now systematically scour the fortress, to\r\nwipe out any hexans that might still be in hiding; to discover and\r\ndestroy any possible traps or infernal machines which the enemy might\r\nhave planted for their undoing.\r\n\r\nAssured that the real danger to the _Sirius_ was over and that his\r\npresence was no longer necessary, Brandon turned his controls over to an\r\nassistant and went up to the Venerian rooms, where von Steiffel and his\r\nstaff were to operate upon the Vorkul. There, in the dense, hot air, but\r\nlittle different now from the atmosphere of Jupiter, Kromodeor lay;\r\nbolted down to the solid steel of the floor by means of padded steel\r\nstraps. So heavy were the bands that he could not possibly break even\r\none of them; so closely were they spaced that he could scarcely have\r\nmoved a muscle had he tried. But he did not try--so near death was he\r\nthat his mighty muscles did not even quiver at the trenchant bite of the\r\nsurgeon's tools. Von Steiffel and his aides, meticulously covered with\r\nsterile gowns, hoods, and gloves, worked in most rigidly aseptic style;\r\ndeftly and rapidly closing the ghastly wounds inflicted by the weapons\r\nof the hexans.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Brandon,\" the surgeon grunted as he straightened up, the work\r\ncompleted. \"I did not use much antiseptic on him. Because of possible\r\ndifferences in blood chemistry and in ignorance of his native bacteria,\r\nI depended almost wholly upon asepsis and his natural resistance. It is\r\na good thing that we did not have to use an anaesthetic. He is in bad\r\nshape, but if we can feed him successfully, he may pull through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feed him? I never thought of that. What d'you suppose he eats?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea that it is something highly concentrated, from his\r\nanatomy. I shall try giving him sugar, milk chocolate, something of\r\nthe kind. First I shall try maple syrup. Being a liquid, it is easily\r\nadministered, and its penetrating odor also may be a help.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA can of the liquid was brought in and to the amazement of the\r\nTerrestrials, the long, delicate antennae of the Vorkul began to twitch\r\nas soon as the can was opened. Motioning hastily for silence, von\r\nSteiffel filled a bowl and placed it upon the floor beneath Kromodeor's\r\ngrotesque nose. The twitching increased, until finally one dull, glazed\r\neye brightened somewhat and curled slowly out upon its slender pedicle,\r\ntoward the dish. His mouth opened sluggishly and a long, red tongue\r\nreached out, but as his perceptions quickened, he became conscious of\r\nthe strangers near him. The mouth snapped shut, the eye retracted, and\r\nheaving, rippling surges traversed that powerful body as he struggled\r\nmadly against the unbreakable shackles of steel binding him to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"_Ach, kindlein_!\" The surgeon bent anxiously over that grotesque but\r\nfrightened head; soothing, polysyllabic German crooning from his bearded\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"Here, let's try this--I'm good on it,\" Stevens suggested, bringing up\r\nthe Callistonian thought exchanger. All three men donned headsets, and\r\nsent wave after wave of friendly and soothing thoughts toward that\r\nfrantic and terrified brain.\r\n\r\n\"He's got his brain shut up like a clam!\" Brandon snorted. \"Open up,\r\nguy--we aren't going to hurt you! We're the best friends you've got,\r\nif you only knew it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Himmel, und he iss himself killing!\" moaned von Steiffel.\r\n\r\n\"One more chance that might work,\" and Brandon stepped over to the\r\ncommunicator, demanding that Verna Pickering be brought at once. She\r\ncame in as soon as the air-locks would permit, and the physicist\r\nwelcomed her eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"This fellow's fighting so he's tearing himself to pieces. We can't make\r\nhim receive a thought, and von Steiffel's afraid to use an anaesthetic.\r\nNow it's barely possible that he may understand hexan. I thought you\r\nwasted time learning any of it, but maybe you didn't--see if you can\r\nmake him understand that we're friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl flinched and shrank back involuntarily, but forced herself to\r\napproach that awful head. Bending over, she repeated over and over one\r\nharsh, barking syllable. The effect of that word was magical. Instantly\r\nKromodeor ceased struggling, an eye curled out, and that long, supple\r\ntongue flashed down and into the syrup. Not until the last sticky trace\r\nhad been licked from the bowl did his attention wander from the food.\r\nThen the eye, sparkling brightly now, was raised toward the girl.\r\nSimultaneously four other eyes arose, one directed at each of the men\r\nand the other surveying his bonds and the room in which he was. Then the\r\nVorkul spoke, but his whistling, hissing manner of speech so garbled\r\nthe barking sounds of the hexan words he was attempting to utter, that\r\nVerna's slight knowledge of the language was of no use. She therefore\r\nput on one of the headsets, motioning the men to do the same, and\r\napproached Kromodeor with the other, repeating the hexan word of\r\nfriendly import. This time the Vorkul's brain was not sealed against\r\nthe visitors and thoughts began to flow.\r\n\r\n\"You've used those things a lot,\" Brandon turned to Stevens in a quick\r\naside. \"Can you hide your thoughts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--why?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I can think of is that power system of theirs, and he'd know what\r\nwe were going to do, sure. And I'd better be getting at it anyway. So\r\nyou can wipe that off your mind with a clear conscience--the rest of us\r\nwill get everything they've got there. Your job's to get everything you\r\ncan out of this bird's brain. All x?\"\r\n\r\n\"All x.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you didn't put yours on!\" Verna exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't think I'll have time. If I get started talking to him now,\r\nI'd be here from now on, and I've got a lot of work to do. Steve can\r\ntalk to him for me--see you later,\" and Brandon was gone.\r\n\r\nHe went directly to the Vorkulian fortress, bare now of hexan life and\r\ndevoid of hexan snares and traps. There he and his fellows labored day\r\nafter day learning every secret of every item of armament and equipment\r\naboard the heptagon.\r\n\r\n\"Did you finish up today, Norm?\" asked Stevens one evening. \"Kromodeor's\r\ncoming to life fast. He's able to wiggle around a little now, and is\r\ninsisting that we take off the one chain we keep on him and let him use\r\na plate, to call his people.\"\r\n\r\n\"All washed up. Guess I'll go in and talk to him--you all say he's such\r\nan egg. With this stuff off my mind I can hide it well enough. By the\r\nway, what does he eat?\" And the two friends set out for the Venerian\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n\"Anything that's sweet, apparently, with just enough milk to furnish a\r\nlittle protein. Won't eat meat or vegetables at all--von Steiffel says\r\nthey haven't got much of a digestive tract, and I know that they haven't\r\ngot any teeth. He's already eaten most all the syrup we had on board,\r\nall of the milk chocolate, and a lot of the sugar. But none of us can\r\nget any kind of a raise out of him at all--not even Nadia, when she fed\r\nhim a whole box of chocolates.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I mean what does he eat when he's home?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be a sort of syrup, made from the juices of jungle plants,\r\nwhich they drag in on automatic conveyors and process on automatic\r\nmachinery. But he's a funny mutt--hard to get. Some of his thoughts are\r\nlucid enough, but others we can't make out at all--they are so foreign\r\nto all human nature that they simply do not register as thoughts at all.\r\nOne funny thing, he isn't the least bit curious about anything. He\r\ndoesn't want to examine anything, doesn't ask us any questions, and\r\nwon't tell us anything about anything, so that all we know about him we\r\nfound out purely by accident. For instance, they like games and sports,\r\nand seem to have families. They also have love, liking, and respect for\r\nothers of their own race--but they seem to have no emotions whatever for\r\noutsiders. They're utterly inhuman--I can't describe it--you'll have to\r\nget it for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you find out about the Callistonians who went to see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Negatively, yes. They never arrived. They probably couldn't see in the\r\nfog and must have missed the city. If they tried to land in that jungle,\r\nit was just too bad!\"\r\n\r\n\"That would account for everything. So they're strictly neutral, eh?\r\nWell, I'll tell him 'hi,' anyway.\" Now in the sickroom, Brandon picked\r\nup the headset and sent out a wave of cheery greeting.\r\n\r\nTo his amazement, the mind of the Vorkul was utterly unresponsive\r\nto his thoughts. Not disdainful, not inimical; not appreciative, nor\r\nfriendly--simply indifferent to a degree unknown and incomprehensible to\r\nany human mind. He sent Brandon only one message, which came clear and\r\ncoldly emotionless.\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to talk to you. Tell the hairy doctor that I am now\r\nstrong enough to be allowed to go to the communicator screen. That is\r\nall.\" The Vorkul's mind again became an oblivious maze of unintelligible\r\nthoughts. Not deliberately were Kromodeor's thoughts hidden; he was\r\nconstitutionally unable to interest himself in the thoughts or things of\r\nany alien intelligence.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that for that.\" A puzzled, thoughtful look came over Brandon's\r\nface as he called von Steiffel. \"A queer duck, if there ever was one.\r\nHowever, their ship will never bother us, that's one good thing; and\r\nI think we've got about everything of theirs that we want, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nThe surgeon, after a careful examination of his patient, unlocked the\r\nheavy collar with which he had been restraining the over-anxious Vorkul,\r\nand supported him lightly at the communicator panel. As surely as though\r\nhe had used those controls for years Kromodeor shot the visiray beam out\r\ninto space. One hand upon each of the several dials and one eye upon\r\neach meter, it was a matter only of seconds for him to get in touch with\r\nVorkulia. To the Terrestrials the screen was a gray and foggy blank; but\r\nthe manifest excitement shrieking and whistling from the speaker in\r\nresponse to Kromodeor's signals made it plain that his message was being\r\nreceived with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"They are coming,\" the Vorkul thought, and lay back, exhausted.\r\n\r\n\"Just as well that they're comin' out here, at that,\" Brandon commented.\r\n\"We couldn't begin to handle that structure anywhere near Jupiter--in\r\nfact, we wouldn't want to get very close ourselves, with passengers\r\naboard.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the power of the Vorkulian vessels that in less than twenty\r\nhours another heptagon slowed to a halt beside the _Sirius_ and two of\r\nits crew were wafted aboard.\r\n\r\nThey were ushered into the Venerian room, where they talked briefly with\r\ntheir wounded fellow before they dressed him in a space-suit, which\r\nthey filled with air to their own pressure. Then all three were lifted\r\nlightly into the air, and without a word or a sign were borne through\r\nthe air-locks of the vessel, and into an opening in the wall of the\r\nrescuing heptagon. A green tractor beam reached out, seizing the\r\nderelict, and both structures darted away at such a pace that in a few\r\nminutes they had disappeared in the black depths of space.\r\n\r\n\"Well--that, as I may have remarked before, is indisputably and\r\nconclusively that.\" Brandon broke the surprised, almost stunned, silence\r\nthat followed the unceremonious departure of the visitors. \"I don't know\r\nwhether to feel relieved at the knowledge that they won't bother us, or\r\nwhether to get mad because they won't have anything to do with us.\"\r\n\r\nHe sent the \"All x\" signal to the pilot and the _Sirius_, once more at\r\nthe acceleration of Terrestrial gravity, again bored on through space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSpacehounds Triumphant\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that the hexan threat that had so long oppressed the humanity of the\r\n_Sirius_ was lifted, that dull gray football of armor steel was filled\r\nwith relief and rejoicing as the pilot laid his course for Europa.\r\nLounges and saloons resounded with noise as police, passengers, and such\r\nof the crew as were at liberty made merry. The control room, in which\r\nwere grouped the leaders of the expedition and the scientists, was\r\norderly enough, but a noticeable undertone of gladness had replaced the\r\ntense air it had known so long.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, men!\" Nadia Stevens and Verna Pickering, arms around each other's\r\nwaists, entered the room and saluted the group gaily before they became\r\na part of it.\r\n\r\n\"'Smatter, girls--tired of dancing already?\" asked Brandon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no--we could dance from now on,\" Verna assured him. \"But you see,\r\nNadia hadn't seen that husband of hers for fifteen minutes, and was\r\ngetting lonesome. Being afraid of all you men, she wanted me to come\r\nalong for moral support. The real reason I came, though,\" and she\r\nnarrowed her expressive eyes and lowered her voice mysteriously, \"is\r\nthat you two physicists are here. I want to study my chosen victims a\r\nlittle longer before I decide over which of you to cast the spell of\r\nmy fatal charm.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you can't do that,\" he objected, vigorously. \"Quince and I are\r\ngoing to settle that ourselves some day--by shooting dice, or maybe each\r\nother, or....\" he broke off, listening to an animated conversation going\r\non behind them.\r\n\r\n\"... just simply outrageous!\" Nadia was exclaiming. \"Here we saved his\r\nlife, and I fed him a lot of my candy, and we went to all the trouble of\r\nbringing their ship back here almost to Jupiter for them, and then they\r\nsimply dashed off without a word of thanks or anything! And he always\r\nacted as though he never wanted to see or hear of any of us again, ever!\r\nWhy, they don't _think_ straight--as Norman would say it, they're _full_\r\nof little red _ants_! Why, they aren't even _human_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure not.\" Brandon turned to the flushed speaker. \"They couldn't be,\r\nhardly, with their make-up. But is it absolutely necessary that all\r\nintelligent beings should possess such an emotion as gratitude? Such a\r\nbeing without it does seem funny to us, but I can't see that its lack\r\nnecessarily implies anything particularly important. Keep still a\r\nminute,\" he went on, as Nadia tried to interrupt him, \"and listen to\r\nsome real wisdom. Quince, _you_ tell 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are, of course, very highly developed and extremely intelligent;\r\nbut it should not be surprising that intelligence should manifest\r\nitself in ways quite baffling to us human beings, whose minds work so\r\ndifferently. They are, however ... well, peculiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _won't_ keep still!\" Nadia burst out, at the first opportunity.\r\n\"I don't want to talk about those hideous things any more, anyway.\r\nCome on, Steve, let's go up and dance!\"\r\n\r\nCrowninshield turned to Verna, with the obvious intention of leading\r\nher away, but Brandon interposed.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Crown, but this lady is conducting a highly important\r\npsychological research, so your purely social claims will have to wait\r\nuntil after the scientific work is done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why narrow the field of investigation?\" laughed the girl. \"I'd rather\r\nwiden it, myself--I might prefer a general, even to a physicist!\"\r\n\r\nThey went up to the main saloon and joined the melee there, and after\r\none dance with Verna--all he could claim in that crowd of\r\nmen--Crowninshield turned to Brandon.\r\n\r\n\"You two seem to know Miss Pickering extraordinarily well. Would I be\r\nstepping on your toes if I give her a play?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear ether as far as we're concerned.\" Brandon shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\"She's been kicking around under foot ever since she was knee high to a\r\nduck--we gave her her first lessons on a slide rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be dumb, Norman. That woman's a knock-out--a riot--a regular\r\ntri-planet call-out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she's all x, as far as that goes. She's a good little scout,\r\ntoo--not half as dumb as she acts--and she's one of the squarest little\r\naces that ever waved a plume; but as for _playing_ her--too much like\r\nour kid sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good--me for her!\" and they made their way back down to the control\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nStevens, after his one dance with Nadia, had already returned. Brandon\r\nand Crowninshield found him seated at the calculating machine,\r\ncontinuing a problem which already filled several pages of his notebook.\r\n\r\n\"'Smatter, Steve? So glad to see a calculator and some paper that you\r\ncan't let them alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly--just had a thought a day or so ago. Been computing the\r\norbit of the wreckage of the _Arcturus_ around Jupiter. Think we should\r\nsalvage it--the upper half, at least. It was left intact, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"H ... m ... m. That would be nice, all right. Dope enough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got the direction solid, from my own observations; the velocity's a\r\npretty rough approximation though. But after allowing for my probable\r\nerror, it figures an ellipse of low eccentricity, between the orbits of\r\nIo and Europa. Its period is short--about two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it wonderful to have a brain?\" Brandon addressed the room at\r\nlarge. \"The kid's clever. Nobody else would have thought of it, except\r\nmaybe Westfall. Let's see your figures. Um ... m ... m. According to\r\nthat, we're within an hour of it, right now.\" He turned to the pilot and\r\nsketched rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Get on this line here, please, and decelerate, so that the stuff'll\r\ncatch up with us, and pass the word to the lookouts. Stevens and I will\r\ntake the bow plates.\r\n\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" he went on to Stevens, as they took their places\r\nat main and auxiliary ultra-banks. \"Lot of plunder in that ship.\r\nInstruments, boats, and equipment worth millions, besides most of the\r\njunk of the passengers--clothes, trunks, trinkets, and what-not. You're\r\nthere, bucko!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Chief,\" ... and they fell silent, watching the instruments\r\ncarefully, and from time to time making computations from the readings\r\nof the acceleration and flight meters.\r\n\r\n\"There she is!\" An alarm bell had finally sounded, the ultra-lights had\r\nflared out into space, and upon both screens there shone out images of\r\nthe closely clustered wreckage of the _Arcturus_. But both men were more\r\ninterested just then in the mathematics of the recovery than in the\r\nvessel itself.\r\n\r\n\"Missed it eight minutes of time and eleven divisions on the scale,\"\r\nreported Stevens. \"Not so good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad either--I've seen worse computation.\" Thus lightly was\r\ndismissed a mathematical feat which, a few years earlier, before the\r\ndays of I-P computers, would have been deemed worthy of publication in\r\n\"The Philosophical Magazine.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDirector Newton was called in, and it was decided that the many small\r\nfragments of the vessel were not worth saving; that its upper half\r\nwas all that they should attempt to tow the enormous distance back to\r\nTellus. The pace of the _Sirius_ was adjusted to that of the floating\r\nmasses, and tractor beams were clamped upon the undamaged portion of the\r\nderelict, and upon the two slices from the nose of the craft. A couple\r\nof the larger fragments of wreckage were also taken, to furnish metal\r\nfor the repairs which would be necessary. Acceleration was brought\r\nslowly up to normal, and the battle-scarred cruiser of the void, with\r\nher heavy burden of inert metal, resumed her interrupted voyage toward\r\nEuropa; the satellite upon which the passengers and crew of the\r\nill-fated _Arcturus_ had been so long immured. On she bored through the\r\nether, detector screens full out and greenly scintillant Vorkulian\r\nwall-screens outlining her football shape in weird and ghastly light;\r\nunafraid now of any possible surviving space-craft of the hexans.\r\n\r\nBut if the hexans detected her, they made no sign. Perhaps their fleet\r\nhad been destroyed utterly; perhaps it had been impressed upon even\r\ntheir fierce minds that those sparkling green screens were not to be\r\nmolested with impunity! The satellite was reached without event and down\r\ninto the crater landing shaft the two enormous masses of metal dropped.\r\n\r\nCallisto's foremost citizens were on hand to welcome the Terrestrial\r\nrescuers, and revelry reigned supreme in that deeply buried Europan\r\ncommunity. All humanity celebrated. The Callistonians rejoiced because\r\nthey were now freed from the age-old oppression of the hexan hordes;\r\nbecause they could once more extend their civilization over the Jovian\r\nsatellites and live again their normal lives upon the surface of those\r\nsmall worlds.\r\n\r\nThe Terrestrials were almost equally enthusiastic in the reunion that\r\nmarked the end of the long imprisonment of the refugees.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hull of the _Arcturus_ had been warmed sufficiently to\r\npermit inspection, its original passengers were allowed to visit it\r\nbriefly, to examine and to reclaim their belongings. Of course, some\r\ndamage had been done by the cold of interplanetary space, but in general\r\neverything was as they had left it. Stevens and Nadia were among the\r\nfirst permitted aboard. They went first to the control room, where\r\nStevens found his bag still lying behind Breckenridge's desk, where he\r\nhad thrown it when he first boarded the vessel. Then they made their\r\nway up to Nadia's stateroom, which they found in meticulous order and\r\nspotless in its cleanliness--there is neither dust nor dirt in space.\r\nNadia glanced about the formal little room and laughed up at her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"Funny, isn't it, sweetheart, how little we know what to expect? Just\r\nthink how surprised I would have been, when I left this room, if I had\r\nbeen told that I would have a husband before I got back to it!\"\r\n\r\nBreckenridge's first thought was for his precious triplex automatic\r\nchronometer, which he found, of course, \"way off\"--six and three-tenths\r\nseconds fast. Having corrected the timepiece from that of the _Sirius_,\r\nhe immersed himself in the other delicate instruments of his\r\ndepartment--and he was easy to find from that time on.\r\n\r\nOvercrowded as the _Sirius_ already was, it was decided that the\r\noriginal complement of the _Arcturus_ should occupy their former\r\nquarters aboard her during the return trip. To this end, corps of\r\nmechanics set to work upon the salvaged hulk. Heavy metal work was no\r\nnovelty to the Callistonian engineers and mechanics, and the _Sirius_\r\nalso was well equipped with metal-working machines and men. Thus the\r\nprow was welded; armored, insulating air-breaks were built along the\r\nstern, which was the plane of hexan cleavage, electrical connections\r\nwere restored; and lastly, a set of the great Vorkulian wall-screen\r\ngenerators, absorbers, and dissipators was installed, with sufficient\r\naccumulator capacity for their operation. Director Newton studied this\r\ninstallation in silence for some time, then went in search of Brandon.\r\n\r\n\"I hadn't considered the possibility of being attacked again\r\nbetween here and Tellus, but there's always the chance,\" he admitted.\r\n\"If you think that there is any danger, we will crowd them all into the\r\n_Sirius_. It will not be at all comfortable, but it will be better than\r\nhaving any more of us killed.\"\r\n\r\n\"With that outfit they'll be as safe as we will,\" the scientist assured\r\nhim. \"They can stand as much grief as we can. We'll do the fighting for\r\nthe whole outfit from here, and anything we meet will have to take us\r\nbefore they can touch them. So they had better ride it there, where\r\nthey'll have passengers' accommodations and be comfortable. As to\r\ndanger, I don't know what to expect. They may all be gone and they may\r\nnot. We're going to expect trouble every meter of the way in, though,\r\nand be ready for it.\"\r\n\r\nEverything ready and thoroughly tested, and stream of power flowing\r\ninto the _Arcturus_ from the cosmic receptors of her sister ship, the\r\npassengers and their new possessions were moved into their former\r\nquarters. There was a brief ceremony of farewell, the doors of the\r\nairlocks were closed, the careful check-out was gone through, and the\r\ndriving projectors of the _Sirius_ lifted both great vessels up the\r\nshaft, slowly and easily. And after them, as long as they could be seen,\r\nstared the thousands of Callistonians who thronged the great shaft's\r\nfloor. Many of the spectators were not, strictly speaking, Callistonians\r\nat all. They were really Europans, born and reared in that hidden city\r\nwhich was to have been the last stronghold of Callisto's civilization.\r\nIn that throng were hundreds who had never before seen the light of the\r\nsun nor any of the glories of the firmament, hundreds to whom that brief\r\nglimpse was a foretaste of the free and glorious life which was soon to\r\nbe theirs.\r\n\r\nUp and up mounted that powerful tug-boat of space, with her heavy barge,\r\nfalling smoothly upward at normal acceleration. Below her first Europa,\r\nthen mighty Jupiter, became moons growing smaller and smaller. In their\r\nstateroom Nadia's supple waist writhed in the curve of Stevens' arm as\r\nshe turned and looked up at him with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, big fellow, how does it feel to be out of a job? Or are you going\r\nover there every day on a tractor beam to work, as Norman suggested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on your sweet young life!\" he exclaimed. \"Norm thought he was\r\nkidding somebody, but it registered zero. It gives me the pip to loaf\r\naround when there's a lot of work to do, but this is entirely different.\r\nNothing's driving us now, and a fellow's entitled to at least one\r\nhoneymoon during his life. And what a honeymoon this is going to be,\r\nlittle spacehound of my heart! Nothing to do but love you all the way\r\nfrom here to Tellus! Whoopee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's a couple of other things to do,\" she reminded him gaily.\r\n\"You've got to smoke a lot of good cigarettes, I must eat a lot of\r\nDelray's chocolates, and we both really should catch up on eating fancy\r\ncooking. Speaking of eating, isn't that the second call for dinner? It\r\n_is_!\" and they went along the narrow hall toward the elevator. To these\r\ntwo the long journey was to seem all too short.\r\n\r\nLong though the voyage was, it was uneventful. The occupants of the\r\ntwo vessels were in constant touch with each other by means of the\r\ncommunicators, and there was also much visiting back and forth in\r\nperson. Stevens and Nadia came often to the _Sirius_, and were\r\naccompanied frequently by Verna Pickering, who claimed anew her ancient\r\nright of \"kicking around under foot,\" wherever Brandon and Westfall\r\nmight chance to be--and at such times General Crowninshield was\r\npractically certain to appear. And upon days when the beautiful brunette\r\ndid not appear, the commandant generally found it necessary to inspect\r\nin person something in the _Arcturus_.\r\n\r\nDay after day passed, and even the new and ultra-powerful detector\r\nscreens of the _Sirius_ remained unresponsive and cold. Day after day\r\nthe plates before the doubled lookouts and observers remained blank.\r\nPower flowed smoothly and unfailingly into the cosmic receptors, and\r\nthe products of conversion were discharged with equal smoothness and\r\nregularity from the forty-five gigantic driving projectors. The tractor\r\nbeam held its heavy burden easily and the generators functioned\r\nperfectly. And finally a planet began to loom up in the stern lookout\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nVerna, the irrepressible, was in the control room of the _Sirius_,\r\nquarreling adroitly with Brandon and deftly flirting with Crowninshield.\r\nGlancing into the control screen she saw the planet in its end block,\r\nthen studied the instruments briefly.\r\n\r\n\"We're heading for _Mars_!\" she declared with conviction. \"I thought\r\nit looked that way yesterday, but supposed it must be only apparent--a\r\ntrick of piloting or something about the orbit. I thought of course you\r\nwere taking us back home--but you can't _possibly_ get to Tellus on any\r\nsuch course as this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure not,\" Brandon replied easily. \"Certainly it's Mars. Isn't that\r\nwhere the _Arcturus_ started out for? Whoever said we were going to\r\nTellus? Of course, if any of the passengers want to go right back the\r\nIPC will undoubtedly furnish transportation _gratis_. But paste this in\r\nyour hat, Verna, for future reference--when spacehounds start out to go\r\nanywhere they _go_ there, even if they have to spend a year or so on\r\nminus time to do it!\"\r\n\r\nCloser and closer they approached the red planet, swinging around in a\r\nwide arc in order to make their course coincide exactly with the pilot\r\nray of check station M14, which was now precisely in its scheduled\r\nlocation in space. At the chief pilot's desk in the control room of the\r\n_Arcturus_, Breckenridge checked in with the station, then calculated\r\nrapidly the instant of their touching the specially-built bumper\r\nplatforms of spring steel, hemp, and fiber which awaited them upon the\r\nMartian dock of the Interplanetary Corporation. Within range of the\r\nterminal, he plugged into it, waited until the tiny light flashed its\r\ngreen message of attention, and reported.\r\n\r\n\"IPV _Arcturus_; Breckenridge, Chief Pilot; trip number forty-three\r\ntwenty-nine. Checking in--four hundred forty-six days, fifteen hours,\r\neleven minutes, thirty-eight and seven-tenths seconds minus!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: This etext was produced from Amazing Stories July,\r\nAugust and September 1931.
