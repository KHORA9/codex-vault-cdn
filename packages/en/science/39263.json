H. Pickering in Jamaica, make\r\nthe value of sunlight 540,000 times that of moonlight. This makes the\r\nsun's \"stellar magnitude\" minus 26·83, and that of moonlight minus 12·5.\r\nProf. Pickering finds that the light of the full moon is equal to 100,000\r\nstars of zero magnitude. He finds that the moon's \"albedo\" is about\r\n0·0909; or in other words, the moon reflects about one-tenth of the light\r\nwhich falls on it from the sun. He also finds that the light of the full\r\nmoon is about twelve times the light of the half moon: a curious and\r\nrather unexpected result.\r\n\r\nM. C. Fabry found that during the total eclipse of the sun on August 30,\r\n1905, the light of the corona at a distance of five minutes of arc from\r\nthe sun's limit, and in the vicinity of the sun's equator, was about 720\r\ncandle-power. Comparing this with the intrinsic light of the full moon\r\n(2600 candle-power) we have the ratio of 0·28 to 1. He finds that the\r\nlight of the sun in the zenith, and at its mean distance from the earth,\r\nis 100,000 times greater than the light of a \"decimal candle\" placed at a\r\ndistance of one metre from the eye.[1] He also finds that sunlight is\r\nequal to 60,000 million times the light of Vega. This would make the sun's\r\n\"stellar magnitude\" minus 26·7, which does not differ much from Prof.\r\nPickering's result, given above, and is probably not far from the truth.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments made in 1906 at Moscow, Prof. Ceraski found that the\r\nlight of the sun's limb is only 31·4 to 38·4 times brighter than the\r\nillumination of the earth's atmosphere very near the limb. This is a very\r\nunexpected result; and considering the comparative faintness of the sun's\r\ncorona during a total eclipse, it is not surprising that all attempts to\r\nphotograph it without an eclipse have hitherto failed.[2]\r\n\r\nFrom Paschen's investigations on the heat of the sun's surface, he finds a\r\nresult of 5961° (absolute), \"assuming that the sun is a perfectly black\r\nbody.\"[3] Schuster finds that \"There is a stratum near the sun's surface\r\nhaving an average temperature of approximately 5500° C., to which about\r\n0·3 of the sun's radiation is due. The remaining portion of the radiation\r\nhas an intensity equal to that due to a black body having a temperature of\r\nabout 6700° C.\" The above results agree fairly well with those found by\r\nthe late Dr. W. E. Wilson.[4] The assumption of the sun being \"a black\r\nbody\" seems a curious paradox; but the simple meaning of the statement is\r\nthat the sun is assumed to act as a radiator as _if it were a perfectly\r\nblack body heated to the high temperature given above_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Langley, the sun's photosphere is 5000 times brighter\r\nthan the molten metal in a \"Bessemer convertor.\"[5]\r\n\r\nObservations of the sun even with small telescopes and protected by dark\r\nglasses are very dangerous to the eyesight. Galileo blinded himself in\r\nthis way; Sir William Herschel lost one of his eyes; and some modern\r\nobservers have also suffered. The present writer had a narrow escape from\r\npermanent injury while observing the transit of Venus, in 1874, in India,\r\nthe dark screen before the eyepiece of a 3-inch telescope having\r\nblistered--that is, partially fused during the observation. Mr. Cooper,\r\nMarkree Castle, Ireland, in observing the sun, used a \"drum\" of alum water\r\nand dark spectacles, and found this sufficient protection against the\r\nglare in using his large refracting telescope of 13·3-inches aperture.\r\n\r\nProf. Mitchell, of Columbia University (U.S.A.), finds that lines due to\r\nthe recently discovered atmospherical gases argon and neon are present in\r\nthe spectrum of the sun's chromosphere. The evidence for the existence of\r\nkrypton and xenon is, however, inconclusive. Prof. Mitchell suggests that\r\nthese gases may possibly have reached the earth's atmosphere from the sun.\r\nThis would agree with the theory advanced by Arrhenius that \"ionised\r\nparticles are constantly being repulsed by the pressure of light, and thus\r\njourney from one sun to another.\"[6]\r\n\r\nProf. Young in 1870, and Dr. Kreusler in June, 1904, observed the helium\r\nline D_{3} as a _dark_ line \"in the spectrum of the region about a\r\nsun-spot.\"[7] This famous line, from which helium was originally\r\ndiscovered in the sun, and by which it was long afterwards detected in\r\nterrestrial minerals, usually appears as a _bright_ line in the spectrum\r\nof the solar chromosphere and \"prominences.\" It has also been seen _dark_\r\nby Mr. Buss in sun-spot regions.[8]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of sun-spots was claimed by Hariotte, in 1610, and by\r\nGalileo, Fabricius, and Scheiner, in 1611. The latter wrote 800 pages on\r\nthem, and thought they were small planets revolving round the sun! This\r\nidea was also held by Tardè, who called them _Astra Borbonia_, and by C.\r\nMalapert, who termed them _Sydera Austricea_. But they seem to have been\r\nnoticed by the ancients.\r\n\r\nAlthough in modern times there has been no extraordinary development of\r\nsun-spots at the epoch of maximum, it is not altogether impossible that in\r\nformer times these spots may have occasionally increased to such an\r\nextent, both in number and size, as to have perceptibly darkened the sun's\r\nlight. A more probable explanation of recorded sun-darkenings seems,\r\nhowever, to be the passing of a meteoric or nebulous cloud between the sun\r\nand the earth. A remarkable instance of sun-darkening recorded in Europe\r\noccurred on May 22, 1870, when the sun's light was observed to be\r\nconsiderably reduced in a cloudless sky in the west of Ireland, by the\r\nlate John Birmingham; at Greenwich on the 23rd; and on the same date, but\r\nat a later hour, in North-Eastern France--\"a progressive manifestation,\"\r\nMr. Birmingham says, \"that seems to accord well with the hypothesis of\r\nmoving nebulous matter.\" A similar phenomenon was observed in New England\r\n(U.S.A.), on September 6, 1881.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest spots ever seen on the sun was observed in June, 1843.\r\nIt remained visible for seven or eight days. According to Schwabe--the\r\ndiscoverer of the sun-spot period--its diameter was 74,000 miles, so that\r\nits area was many times that of the earth's surface. The most curious\r\nthing about this spot was that it appeared near a _minimum_ of the\r\nsun-spot cycle! and was therefore rather an anomalous phenomenon. It was\r\nsuggested by the late Daniel Kirkwood that this great spot was caused by\r\nthe fall of meteoric matter into the sun; and that it had possibly some\r\nconnection with the great comet of 1843, which approached the sun nearer\r\nthan any other recorded comet, its distance from the sun at perihelion\r\nbeing about 65,000 miles, or less than one-third of the moon's distance\r\nfrom the earth. This near approach of the comet to the sun occurred about\r\nthree months before the appearance of the great sun-spot; and it seems\r\nprobable that the spot was caused by the downfall of a large meteorite\r\ntravelling in the wake of the comet.[9] The connection between comets and\r\nmeteors is well known.\r\n\r\nThe so-called blackness of sun-spots is merely relative. They are really\r\nvery bright. The most brilliant light which can be produced artificially\r\nlooks like a black spot when projected on the sun's disc.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Robert Ball a pound of coal striking a body with a\r\nvelocity of five miles a second would develop as much heat as it would\r\nproduce by its combustion. A body falling into the sun from infinity would\r\nhave a velocity of 450 miles a second when it reached the sun's surface.\r\nNow as the momentum varies as the square of the velocity we have a pound\r\nof coal developing 90{2} (=450/5){2}, or 8,100 times as much heat as would\r\nbe produced by its combustion. If the sun were formed of coal it would be\r\nconsumed in about 3000 years. Hence it follows that the contraction of the\r\nsun's substance from infinity would produce a supply of heat for 3000 ×\r\n8100, or 24,300,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Proctor and Prof. Young believed \"that the contraction theory\r\nof the sun's heat is the true and only available theory.\" The theory is,\r\nof course, a sound one; but it may now be supplemented by supposing the\r\nsun to contain a certain small amount of radium. This would bring physics\r\nand geology into harmony. Proctor thought the \"sun's real globe is very\r\nmuch smaller than the globe we see. In other words the process of\r\ncontraction has gone on further than, judging from the sun's apparent\r\nsize, we should suppose it to have done, and therefore represents more sun\r\nwork\" done in past ages.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the suggestion, recently made, that a portion, at least,\r\nof the sun's heat may be due to radium, and the experiments which have\r\nbeen made with negative results, Mr. R. T. Strutt--the eminent\r\nphysicist--has made some calculations on the subject and says, \"even if\r\nall the sun's heat were due to radium, there does not appear to be the\r\nsmallest possibility that the Becquerel radiation from it could ever be\r\ndetected at the earth's surface.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThe eminent Swedish physicist Arrhenius, while admitting that a large\r\nproportion of the sun's heat is due to contraction, considers that it is\r\nprobably the chemical processes going on in the sun, and not the\r\ncontraction which constitute the _chief_ source of the solar heat.[11]\r\n\r\nAs the centre of gravity of the sun and Jupiter lies at a distance of\r\nabout 460,000 miles from the sun's centre, and the sun's radius is only\r\n433,000 miles, it follows that the centre of gravity of the sun and planet\r\nis about 27,000 miles _outside_ the sun's surface. The attractions of the\r\nother planets perpetually change the position of the centre of gravity of\r\nthe solar system; but in some books on astronomy it is erroneously stated\r\nthat the centre of gravity of the system is _always_ within the sun's\r\nsurface. If _all_ the planets lay on the same side of the sun at the same\r\ntime (as might possibly happen), then the centre of gravity of the whole\r\nsystem would lie considerably more than 27,000 miles outside the sun's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the sun's great size, Carl Snyder has well said, \"It was\r\nas if in Vulcan's smithy the gods had moulded one giant ball, and the\r\nplanets were but bits and small shot which had spattered off as the\r\nglowing ingot was cast and set in space. Little man on a little part of a\r\nlittle earth--a minor planet, a million of which might be tumbled into the\r\nshell of the central sun--was growing very small; his wars, the\r\nconvulsions of a state, were losing consequence. Human endeavour, human\r\nambitions could now scarce possess the significance they had when men\r\ncould regard the earth as the central fact of the universe.\"[12]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the late Prof. C. A. Young (U.S.A.)--a great authority\r\non the sun--an American writer has written the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"The destined course of whirling worlds to trace,\r\n  To plot the highways of the universe,\r\n  And hear the morning stars their song rehearse,\r\n  And find the wandering comet in his place;\r\n  This is the triumph written in his face,\r\n  And in the gleaming eye that read the sun\r\n  Like open book, and from the spectrum won\r\n  The secrets of immeasurable space.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMercury\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the elongation of Mercury from the sun seldom exceeds 18°, it is a\r\ndifficult object, at least in this country, to see without a telescope. As\r\nthe poet says, the planet--\r\n\r\n  \"Can scarce be caught by philosophic eye\r\n  Lost in the near effulgence of its blaze.\"\r\n\r\nTycho Brahé, however, records several observations of Mercury with the\r\nunaided vision in Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt can be occasionally caught with the naked eye in this country after\r\nsunset, when it is favourably placed for observation, and I have so seen\r\nit several times in Ireland. On February 19, 1888, I found it very visible\r\nin strong twilight near the western horizon, and apparently brighter than\r\nan average star of the first magnitude would be in the same position. In\r\nthe clear air of the Punjab sky I observed Mercury on November 24-29,\r\n1872, near the western horizon after sunset. Its appearance was that of a\r\nreddish star of the first magnitude. On November 29 I compared its\r\nbrilliancy with that of Saturn, which was some distance above it, and\r\nmaking allowance for the glare near the horizon in which Mercury was\r\nimmersed, its brightness appeared to me to be quite equal to that of\r\nSaturn. In June, 1874, I found it equal to Aldebaran, and of very much the\r\nsame colour. Mr. W. F. Denning, the famous observer of meteors, states\r\nthat he observed Mercury with the naked eye about 150 times during the\r\nyears 1868 to 1905.[14]\r\n\r\nHe found that the duration of visibility after sunset is about 1{h} 40{m}\r\nwhen seen in March, 1{h} 30{m} in April, and 1{h} 20{m} in May. He thinks\r\nthat the planet is, at its brightest, \"certainly much brighter than a\r\nfirst magnitude star.\"[15] In February, 1868, he found that its brightness\r\nrivalled that of Jupiter, then only 2° or 3° distant. In November, 1882,\r\nit seemed brighter than Sirius. In 1876 it was more striking than Mars,\r\nbut the latter was then \"faint and at a considerable distance from the\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1878, when Mercury and Venus were in the same field of view of a\r\ntelescope, Nasmyth found that the surface brightness (or \"intrinsic\r\nbrightness,\" as it is called) of Venus was at least twice as great as that\r\nof Mercury; and Zöllner found that from a photometric point of view the\r\nsurface of Mercury is comparable with that of the moon.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the difficulty of seeing Mercury, owing to its proximity\r\nto the sun, Admiral Smyth says, \"Although Mercury is never in _opposition_\r\nto the earth, he was, when in the house of Mars, always viewed by\r\nastrologers as a most malignant planet, and one full of evil influences.\r\nThe sages stigmatized him as a false deceitful star (_sidus dolosum_), the\r\neternal torment of astronomers, eluding them as much as terrestrial\r\nmercury did the alchemists; and Goad, who in 1686 published a whole folio\r\nvolume full of astro-meteorological aphorisms, unveiling the choicest\r\nsecrets of nature, contemptuously calls Mercury a 'squinting lacquey of\r\nthe sun, who seldom shows his head in these parts, as if he was in debt.'\r\nHis extreme mobility is so striking that chemists adopted his symbol to\r\ndenote quicksilver.\"[16]\r\n\r\nProf. W. H. Pickering thinks that the shortness of the cusps (or \"horns\")\r\nof Mercury's disc indicates that the planet's atmosphere is of small\r\ndensity--even rarer than that of Mars.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of Mercury is usually stated at about 3000 miles; but a long\r\nseries of measures made by Prof. See in the year 1901 make the real\r\ndiameter about 2702 miles. This would make the planet smaller than some of\r\nthe satellites of the large planets, probably smaller than satellites III.\r\nand IV. of Jupiter, less than Saturn's satellite Titan, and possibly\r\ninferior in size to the satellite of Neptune. Prof. Pickering thinks that\r\nthe density of Mercury is about 3 (water = 1). Dr. See's observations show\r\n\"no noticeable falling off in the brightness of Mercury near the limb.\"\r\nThere is therefore no evidence of any kind of atmospheric absorption in\r\nMercury, and the observer \"gets the impression that the physical condition\r\nof the planet is very similar to that of our moon.\"[17]\r\n\r\nSchröter (1780-1815) observed markings on Mercury, from which he inferred\r\nthat the planet's surface was mountainous, and one of these mountains he\r\nestimated at about 11 miles in height![18] But this seems very doubtful.\r\n\r\nTo account for the observed irregularities in the motion of Mercury in its\r\norbit, Prof. Newcomb thinks it possible that there may exist a ring or\r\nzone of \"asteroids\" a little \"outside the orbit of Mercury\" and having a\r\ncombined mass of \"one-fiftieth to one-three-hundredth of the mass of\r\nVenus, according to its distance from Mercury.\" Prof. Newcomb, however,\r\nconsiders that the existence of such a ring is extremely improbable, and\r\nregards it \"more as a curiosity than a reality.\"[19]\r\n\r\nM. Léo Brenner thinks that he has seen the dark side of Mercury, in the\r\nsame way that the dark side of Venus has been seen by many observers. In\r\nthe case of Mercury the dark side appeared _darker_ than the background of\r\nthe sky. Perhaps this may be due to its being projected on the zodiacal\r\nlight, or outer envelope of the sun.[20]\r\n\r\nMercury is said to have been occulted by Venus in the year 1737.[21] But\r\nwhether this was an actual occultation, or merely a near approach does not\r\nseem to be certain.\r\n\r\nThe first transit of Mercury across the sun's disc was observed by\r\nGassendi on November 6, 1631, and Halley observed one on November 7, 1677,\r\nwhen in the island of St. Helena.\r\n\r\nSeen from Mercury, Venus would appear brighter than even we see it, and as\r\nit would be at its brightest when in opposition to the sun, and seen on a\r\ndark sky with a full face, it must present a magnificent appearance in the\r\nmidnight sky of Mercury. The earth will also form a brilliant object, and\r\nthe moon would be distinctly visible. The other planets would appear very\r\nmuch as they do to us, but with somewhat less brilliancy owing to their\r\ngreater distance.\r\n\r\nAs the existence of an intra-Mercurial planet (that is a planet revolving\r\nround the sun within the orbit of Mercury) seems now to be very\r\nimprobable, Prof. Perrine suggests that possibly \"the finely divided\r\nmatter which produces the zodiacal light when considered in the aggregate\r\nmay be sufficient to cause the perturbations in the orbit of Mercury.\"[22]\r\nProf. Newcomb, however, questions the exact accuracy of Newton's law, and\r\nseems to adopt Hall's hypothesis that gravity does not act _exactly_ as\r\nthe inverse square of the distance, and that the exponent of the distance\r\nis not 2, but 2·0000001574.[23]\r\n\r\nVoltaire said, \"If Newton had been in Portugal, and any Dominican had\r\ndiscovered a heresy in his inverse ratio of the squares of the distances,\r\nhe would without hesitation have been clothed in a _san benito_, and burnt\r\nas a sacrifice to God at an _auto da fé_.\"[24]\r\n\r\nAn occultation of Mercury by Venus was observed with a telescope on May\r\n17, 1737.[25]\r\n\r\nMay transits of Mercury across the sun's disc will occur in the years\r\n1924, 1957, and 1970; and November transits in the years 1914, 1927, and\r\n1940.[26]\r\n\r\nFrom measurements of the disc of Mercury during the last transit, M. R.\r\nJonckheere concludes that the _polar_ diameter of the planet is greater\r\nthan the _equatorial_! His result, which is very curious, if true, seems\r\nto be supported by the observations of other observers.[27]\r\n\r\nThe rotation period of Mercury, or the length of its day, seems to be\r\nstill in doubt. From a series of observations made in the years 1896 to\r\n1909, Mr. John McHarg finds a period of 1·0121162 day, or 1{d} 0{h} 17{m}\r\n26{s}·8. He thinks that \"the planet possesses a considerable atmosphere\r\nnot so clear as that of Mars\"; that \"its axis is very considerably\r\ntilted\"; and that it \"has fairly large sheets of water.\"[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nVenus\r\n\r\n\r\nVenus was naturally--owing to its brightness--the first of the planets\r\nknown to the ancients. It is mentioned by Hesiod, Homer, Virgil, Martial,\r\nand Pliny; and Isaiah's remark about \"Lucifer, son of the morning\" (Isaiah\r\nxiv. 12) probably refers to Venus as a \"morning star.\" An observation of\r\nVenus is found on the Nineveh tablets of date B.C. 684. It was observed in\r\ndaylight by Halley in July, 1716.\r\n\r\nIn _very_ ancient times Venus, when a morning star, was called Phosphorus\r\nor Lucifer, and when an evening star Hesperus; but, according to Sir G. C.\r\nLewis, the identity of the two objects was known so far back as 540 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhen Venus is at its greatest brilliancy, and appears as a morning star\r\nabout Christmas time (which occurred in 1887, and again in 1889), it has\r\nbeen mistaken by the public for a return of the \"Star of Bethlehem.\"[29]\r\nBut whatever \"the star of the Magi\" was it certainly was _not_ Venus. It,\r\nseems, indeed absurd to suppose that \"the wise men\" of the East should\r\nhave mistaken a familiar object like Venus for a strange apparition. There\r\nseems to be nothing whatever in the Bible to lead us to expect that the\r\nstar of Bethlehem will reappear.\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Stockwell has suggested that the \"Star of Bethlehem\" may perhaps\r\nbe explained by a conjunction of the planets Venus and Jupiter which\r\noccurred on May 8, B.C. 6, which was two years before the death of Herod.\r\nFrom this it would follow that the Crucifixion took place on April 3, A.D.\r\n33. But it seems very doubtful that the phenomenon recorded in the Bible\r\nrefers to any conjunction of planets.\r\n\r\nChacornac found the intrinsic brightness of Venus to be ten times greater\r\nthan the most luminous parts of the moon.[30] But this estimate is\r\nprobably too high.\r\n\r\nWhen at its brightest, the planet is visible in broad daylight to good\r\neyesight, if its exact position in the sky is known. In the clear air of\r\nCambridge (U.S.A.) it is said to be possible to see it in this way in all\r\nparts of its orbit, except when the planet is within 10° of the sun.[31]\r\nMr. A. Cameron, of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, has, however, seen Venus with\r\nthe naked eye three days before conjunction when the planet was only\r\n6-1/4° from the sun.[32] This seems a remarkable observation, and shows\r\nthat the observer's eyesight must have been very keen. In a private letter\r\ndated October 22, 1888, the late Rev. S. J. Johnson informed the present\r\nwriter that he saw Venus with the naked eye only four days before\r\nconjunction with the sun in February, 1878, and February, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe crescent shape of Venus is said to have been seen with the naked eye\r\nby Theodore Parker in America when he was only 12 years old. Other\r\nobservers have stated the same thing; but the possibility of such an\r\nobservation has been much disputed in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn the Chinese Annals some records are given of Venus having been seen in\r\nthe Pleiades. On March 16, A.D. 845, it is said that \"Venus eclipsed the\r\nPleiades.\" This means, of course, that the cluster was apparently effaced\r\nby the brilliant light of the planet. Computing backwards for the above\r\ndate, Hind found that on the evening of March 16, 845, Venus was situated\r\nnear the star Electra; and on the following evening the planet passed\r\nclose to Maia; thus showing the accuracy of the Chinese record. Another\r\n\"eclipse\" of the Pleiades by Venus is recorded in the same annals as\r\nhaving occurred on March 10, A.D. 1002.[33]\r\n\r\nWhen Venus is in the crescent phase, that is near \"Inferior conjunction\"\r\nwith the sun, it will be noticed, even by a casual observer, that the\r\ncrescent is not of the same shape as that of the crescent moon. The horns\r\nor \"cusps\" of the planetary crescent are more prolonged than in the case\r\nof the moon, and extend beyond the hemisphere. This appearance is caused\r\nby refraction of the sun's light through the planetary atmosphere, and is,\r\nin fact, a certain proof that Venus has an atmosphere similar to that of\r\nthe earth. Observations further show that this atmosphere is denser than\r\nours.\r\n\r\nSeen from Venus, the earth and moon, when in opposition, must present a\r\nsplendid spectacle. I find that the earth would shine as a star about half\r\nas bright again as Venus at her brightest appears to us, and the moon\r\nabout equal in brightness to Sirius! the two forming a superb \"naked eye\r\ndouble star\"--perhaps the finest sight of its kind in the solar\r\nsystem.[34]\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier observers, such as La Hire, Fontana, Cassini, and\r\nSchröter, thought they saw evidence of mountains on Venus. Schröter\r\nestimated some of these to be 27 or 28 miles in height! but this seems\r\nvery doubtful. Sir William Herschel severely attacked these supposed\r\ndiscoveries. Schröter defended himself, and was supported by Beer and\r\nMädler, the famous lunar observers. Several modern observers seem to\r\nconfirm Schröter's conclusions; but very little is really known about the\r\ntopography of Venus.\r\n\r\nThe well-known French astronomer Trouvelot--a most excellent observer--saw\r\nwhite spots on Venus similar to those on Mars. These were well seen and\r\nquite brilliant in July and August, 1876, and in February and November,\r\n1877. The observations seem to show that these spots do not (unlike Mars)\r\nincrease and decrease with the planet's seasons. These white spots had\r\nbeen previously noticed by former observers, including Bianchini, Derham,\r\nGruithuisen, and La Hire; but these early observers do not seem to have\r\nconsidered them as snow caps, like those of Mars. Trouvelot was led by his\r\nown observations to conclude that the period of rotation of Venus is\r\nshort, and the best result he obtained was 23{h} 49{m} 28{s}. This does\r\nnot differ much from the results previously found by De Vico, Fritsch, and\r\nSchröter.[35]\r\n\r\nA white spot near the planet's south pole was seen on several occasions by\r\nH. C. Russell in May and June, 1876.[36]\r\n\r\nPhotographs of Venus taken on March 18 and April 29, 1908, by M. Quénisset\r\nat the Observatory of Juvissy, France, show a white polar spot. The spot\r\nwas also seen at the same observatory by M. A. Benoit on May 20, 1903.\r\n\r\nThe controversy on the period of rotation of Venus, or the length of its\r\nday, is a very curious one and has not yet been decided. Many good\r\nobservers assert confidently that it is short (about 24 hours); while\r\nothers affirm with equal confidence that it is long (about 225 days, the\r\nperiod of the planet's revolution round the sun). Among the observers who\r\nfavour the short period of rotation are: D. Cassini (1667), J. Cassini\r\n(1730), Schröter (1788-93), Mädler (1836), De Vico (1840?) Trouvelot\r\n(1871-79), Flammarion, Léo Brenner, Stanley Williams, and J. McHarg; and\r\namong those who support the long period are: Bianchini (1727),\r\nSchiaparelli, Cerulli, Tacchini, Mascari, and Lowell. Some recent\r\nspectroscopic observations seem to favour the short period.\r\n\r\nFlammarion thinks that \"nothing certain can be descried upon the surface\r\nof Venus, and that whatever has hitherto been written regarding its period\r\nof rotation must be considered null and void\"; and again he says, \"Nothing\r\ncan be affirmed regarding the rotation of Venus, inasmuch as the\r\nabsorption of its immense atmosphere certainly prevents any detail on its\r\nsurface from being perceived.\"[37]\r\n\r\nThe eminent Swedish physicist Arrhenius thinks, however, that the dense\r\natmosphere and clouds of Venus are in favour of a rapid rotation on its\r\naxis.[38] He thinks that the mean temperature of Venus may \"not differ\r\nmuch from the calculated temperature 104° F.\" \"Under these circumstances\r\nthe assumption would appear plausible that a very considerable portion of\r\nthe surface of Venus, and particularly the districts about the poles,\r\nwould be favourable to organic life.\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe \"secondary light of Venus,\" or the visibility of the dark side, seems\r\nto have been first mentioned by Derham in his _Astro Theology_ published\r\nin 1715. He speaks of the visibility of the dark part of the planet's disc\r\n\"by the aid of a light of a somewhat dull and ruddy colour.\" The date of\r\nDerham's observation is not given, but it seems to have been previous to\r\nthe year 1714. The light seems to have been also seen by a friend of\r\nDerham. We next find observations by Christfried Kirch, assistant\r\nastronomer to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, on June 7, 1721, and March\r\n8, 1726. These observations are found in his original papers, and were\r\nprinted in the _Astronomische Nachrichten_, No. 1586. On the first date\r\nthe telescopic image of the planet was \"rather tremulous,\" but in 1726 he\r\nnoticed that the dark part of the circle seemed to belong to a smaller\r\ncircle than the illuminated portion of the disc.[40] The same effect was\r\nalso noted by Webb.[41] A similar illusion is seen in the case of the\r\ncrescent moon, and this has given rise to the saying, \"the old moon in the\r\nnew moon's arms.\"\r\n\r\nWe next come, in order of date, to an observation made by Andreas Mayer,\r\nProfessor of Mathematics at Griefswald in Prussia. The observation was\r\nmade on October 20, 1759, and the dark part of Venus was seen distinctly\r\nby Mayer. As the planet's altitude at the time was not more than 14° above\r\nthe horizon, and its apparent distance from the sun only 10°, the\r\nphenomenon--as Professor Safarik has pointed out--\"must have had a most\r\nunusual intensity.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel makes no mention of having ever seen the \"secondary\r\nlight\" of Venus, although he noticed the extension of the horns beyond a\r\nsemicircle.\r\n\r\nIn the spring and summer of the year 1793, Von Hahn of Remplin in\r\nMecklenburg, using excellent telescopes made by Dollond and Herschel, saw\r\nthe dark part of Venus on several occasions, and describes the light as\r\n\"grey verging upon brown.\"\r\n\r\nSchröter of Lilienthal--the famous observer of the moon--saw the horns of\r\nthe crescent of Venus extended many degrees beyond the semicircle on\r\nseveral occasions in 1784 and 1795, and the border of the dark part\r\nfaintly lit up by a dusky grey light. On February 14, 1806, at 7 P.M. he\r\nsaw the whole of the dark part visible with an ash-coloured light, and he\r\nwas satisfied that there was no illusion. On January 24 of the same year,\r\n1806, Harding at Göttingen, using a reflector of 9 inches aperture and\r\npower 84, saw the dark side of Venus \"shining with a pale ash-coloured\r\nlight,\" and very visible against the dark background of the sky. The\r\nappearance was seen with various magnifying powers, and he thought that\r\nthere could be no illusion. In fact the phenomenon was as evident as in\r\nthe case of the moon. Harding again saw it on February 28 of the same\r\nyear, the illumination being of a reddish grey colour, \"like that of the\r\nmoon in a total eclipse.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"secondary light\" was also seen by Pastorff in 1822, and by\r\nGruithuisen in 1825. Since 1824 observations of the \"light\" were made by\r\nBerry, Browning, Guthrie, Langdon, Noble, Prince, Webb, and others. Webb\r\nsaw it with powers of 90 and 212 on a 9·38-inch mirror, and found it\r\n\"equally visible when the bright crescent was hidden by a field bar.\"[42]\r\n\r\nCaptain Noble's observation was rather unique. He found that the dark side\r\nwas \"always distinctly and positively _darker_ than the background upon\r\nwhich it is projected.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"light\" was also seen by Lyman in America in 1867, and by Safarik at\r\nPrague. In 1871 the whole disc of Venus was seen by Professor\r\nWinnecke.[43] On the other hand, Winnecke stated that he only saw it twice\r\nin 24 years; and the great observers Dawes and Mädler never saw it at\r\nall![44]\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to explain the visibility--at times--of\r\nthe \"dark side\" of Venus. The following may be mentioned[45]:--(1)\r\nReflected earth-light, analogous to the dark side of the crescent moon.\r\nThis explanation was advocated by Harding, Schröter, and others. But,\r\nalthough the earth is undoubtedly a bright object in the sky of Venus, the\r\nexplanation is evidently quite inadequate. (2) Phosphorescence of the\r\nplanet's atmosphere. This has been suggested by some observers. (3)\r\nVisibility by contrast, a theory advanced by the great French astronomer\r\nArago. (4) Illumination of the planet's surface by an aurora borealis.\r\nThis also seems rather inadequate, but would account for the light being\r\nsometimes visible and sometimes not. (5) Luminosity of the oceans--if\r\nthere be any--on Venus. But this also seems inadequate. (6) A planetary\r\nsurface glowing with intense heat. But this seems improbable. (7) The\r\nKunstliche Feuer (artificial fire) of Gruithuisen, a very fanciful theory.\r\nFlammarion thinks that the visibility of the dark side may perhaps be\r\nexplained by its projection on a somewhat lighter background, such as the\r\nzodiacal light, or an extended solar envelope.[46]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that none of these explanations are entirely satisfactory,\r\nand the phenomenon, if real, remains a sort of astronomical enigma. The\r\nfact that the \"light\" is visible on some occasions and not on others would\r\nrender some of the explanations improbable or even inadmissible. But the\r\ncondition of the earth's atmosphere at times might account for its\r\ninvisibility on many occasions.\r\n\r\nA curious suggestion was made by Zöllner, namely, that if the secondary\r\nlight of Venus could be observed with the spectroscope it would show\r\nbright lines! But such an observation would be one of extreme difficulty.\r\n\r\nM. Hansky finds that the visibility of the \"light\" is greater during\r\nperiods of maximum solar activity--that is, at the maxima of sun spots.\r\nThis he explains by the theory of Arrhenius, in which electrified \"ions\r\nemitted by the sun cause the phenomena of terrestrial magnetic storms and\r\nauroras.\" \"In the same way the dense atmosphere of Venus is rendered more\r\nphosphorescent, and therefore more easily visible by the increased solar\r\nactivity.\"[47] This seems a very plausible hypothesis.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the occasional illumination of the night side of Venus by a\r\nvery brilliant aurora (explanation (4) above) seems to the present writer\r\nto be the most probable explanation. Gruithuisen's hypothesis (7) seems\r\nutterly improbable.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious apparent anomaly about the motion of Venus in the sky.\r\nAlthough the planet's period of revolution round the sun is 224·7 days, it\r\nremains on the same side of the sun, as seen from the earth, for 290 days.\r\nThe reason of this is that the earth is going at the same time round the\r\nsun in the same direction, though at a slower pace; and Venus must\r\ncontinue to appear on the same side of the sun until the excess of her\r\ndaily motion above that of the earth amounts to 179°, and this at the\r\ndaily rate of 37' will be about 290 days.\r\n\r\nSeveral observations have been recorded of a supposed satellite of Venus.\r\nBut the existence of such a body has never been verified. In the year\r\n1887, M. Stroobant investigated the various accounts, and came to the\r\nconclusion that in several at least of the recorded observations the\r\nobject seen was certainly a star. Thus, in the observation made by\r\nRoedickoer and Boserup on August 4, 1761, a satellite and star are\r\nrecorded as having been seen near the planet. M. Stroobant finds that the\r\nsupposed \"satellite\" was the star [Greek: ch]_{4} Orionis, and the \"star\"\r\n[Greek: ch]_{3} Orionis. A supposed observation of a satellite made by\r\nHorrebow on January 3, 1768, was undoubtedly [Greek: th] Libræ. M.\r\nStroobant found that the supposed motion of the \"satellite\" as seen by\r\nHorrebow is accurately represented by the motion of Venus itself during\r\nthe time of observation. In most of the other supposed observations of a\r\nsatellite a satisfactory identification has also been found. M. Stroobant\r\nfinds that with a telescope of 6 inches aperture, a star of the 8th or\r\neven the 9th magnitude can be well seen when close to Venus.[49]\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 13, 1892, Professor Barnard, while examining Venus\r\nwith the great 36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory, saw a star of\r\nthe 7th magnitude in the same field with the planet. He carefully\r\ndetermined the exact position of this star, and found that it is not in\r\nArgelander's great catalogue, the _Durchmusterung_. Prof. Barnard finds\r\nthat owing to elongation of Venus from the sun at the time of observation\r\nthe star could not possibly be an intra-Mercurial planet (that is, a\r\nplanet revolving round the sun inside the orbit of Mercury); but that\r\npossibly it might be a planet revolving between the orbits of Venus and\r\nMercury. As the brightest of the minor planets--Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and\r\nVesta--were not at the time near the position of the observed object, the\r\nobservation remains unexplained. It might possibly have been a _nova_, or\r\ntemporary star.[50]\r\n\r\nScheuten is said to have seen a supposed satellite of Venus following the\r\nplanet across the sun at the end of the transit of June 6, 1761.[51]\r\n\r\nHumboldt speaks of the supposed satellite of Venus as among \"the\r\nastronomical myths of an uncritical age.\"[52]\r\n\r\nAn occultation of Venus by the moon is mentioned in the Chinese Annals as\r\nhaving occurred on March 19, 361 A.D., and Tycho Brahé observed another on\r\nMay 23, 1587.[53]\r\n\r\nA close conjunction of Venus and Regulus ([Greek: a] Leonis) is recorded\r\nby the Arabian astronomer, Ibn Yunis, as having occurred on September 9,\r\n885 A.D. Calculations by Hind show that the planet and star were within 2'\r\nof arc on that night, and consequently would have appeared as a single\r\nstar to the naked eye. The telescope had not then been invented.[54]\r\n\r\nSeen from Venus, the maximum apparent distance between the earth and moon\r\nwould vary from about 5' to 31'.[55]\r\n\r\nIt is related by Arago that Buonaparte, when going to the Luxembourg in\r\nParis, where the Directory were giving a fête in his honour, was very\r\nmuch surprised to find the crowd assembled in the Rue de Touracour \"pay\r\nmore attention to a region of the heavens situated above the palace than\r\nto his person or the brilliant staff that accompanied him. He inquired the\r\ncause and learned that these curious persons were observing with\r\nastonishment, although it was noon, a star, which they supposed to be that\r\nof the conqueror of Italy--an allusion to which the illustrious general\r\ndid not seem indifferent, when he himself, with his piercing eyes,\r\nremarked the radiant body.\" The \"star\" in question was Venus.[56]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Earth\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth being our place of abode is, of course, to us the most important\r\nplanet in the solar system. It is a curious paradox that the moon's\r\nsurface (at least the visible portion) is better known to us than the\r\nsurface of the earth. Every spot on the moon's visible surface equal in\r\nsize to say Liverpool or Glasgow is well known to lunar observers, whereas\r\nthere are thousands of square miles on the earth's surface--for example,\r\nnear the poles and in the centre of Australia--which are wholly unknown to\r\nthe earth's inhabitants; and are perhaps likely to remain so.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made by \"paradoxers\" to show that the earth is a\r\nflat plane and not a sphere. But M. Ricco has found by actual experiment\r\nthat the reflected image of the setting sun from a smooth sea is an\r\nelongated ellipse. This proves mathematically beyond all doubt that the\r\nsurface of the sea is spherical; for the reflection from a plane surface\r\nwould be necessarily _circular_. The theory of a \"flat earth\" is\r\ntherefore proved to be quite untenable, and all the arguments (?) of the\r\n\"earth flatteners\" have now been--like the French Revolution--\"blown into\r\nspace.\"\r\n\r\nThe pole of minimum temperature in the northern hemisphere, or \"the pole\r\nof cold,\" as it has been termed, is supposed to lie near Werchojansk in\r\nSiberia, where a temperature of nearly -70° has been observed.\r\n\r\nFrom a series of observations made at Annapolis (U.S.A.) on the gradual\r\ndisappearance of the blue of the sky after sunset, Dr. See finds that the\r\nextreme height of the earth's atmosphere is about 130 miles. Prof. Newcomb\r\nfinds that meteors first appear at a mean height of about 74 miles.[57]\r\n\r\nAn aurora seen in Canada on July 15, 1893, was observed from stations 110\r\nmiles apart, and from these observations the aurora was found to lie at a\r\nheight of 166 miles above the earth's surface. It was computed that if the\r\nauroral \"arch maintained an equal height above the earth its ends were\r\n1150 miles away, so that the magnificent sight was presented of an auroral\r\nbelt in the sky with 2300 miles between its two extremities.\"[58]\r\n\r\n\"Luminous clouds\" are bright clouds sometimes seen at night near the end\r\nof June and beginning of July. They appear above the northern horizon\r\nover the sun's place about midnight, and evidently lie at a great height\r\nabove the earth's surface. Observations made in Germany by Dr. Jesse, and\r\nin England by Mr. Backhouse, in the years 1885-91, show that the height of\r\nthese clouds is nearly constant at about 51 miles.[59] The present writer\r\nhas seen these remarkable clouds on one or two occasions in County Sligo,\r\nIreland, during the period above mentioned.\r\n\r\nM. Montigny has shown that \"the approach of violent cyclones or other\r\nstorms is heralded by an increase of scintillation\" (or twinkling of the\r\nstars). The effect is also very evident when such storms pass at a\r\nconsiderable distance. He has also made some interesting observations\r\n(especially on the star Capella), which show that, not only does\r\nscintillation increase in rainy weather, but that \"it is very evident, at\r\nsuch times, in stars situated at an altitude at which on other occasions\r\nit would not be perceptible at all; thus confirming the remark of\r\nHumboldt's with regard to the advent of the wet season in tropical\r\ncountries.\"[60]\r\n\r\nIn a paper on the subject of \"Optical Illusions\" in _Popular Astronomy_,\r\nFebruary, 1906, Mr. Arthur K. Bartlett, of Batter Creek, Michigan\r\n(U.S.A.), makes the following interesting remarks:--\r\n\r\n    \"The lunar halo which by many persons is regarded as a remarkable and\r\n    unexplained luminosity associated with the moon, is to meteorological\r\n    students neither a mysterious nor an anomalous occurrence. It has been\r\n    frequently observed and for many years thoroughly understood, and at\r\n    the present time admits of an easy scientific explanation. It is an\r\n    atmospheric exhibition due to the refraction and dispersion of the\r\n    moon's light through very minute ice crystals floating at great\r\n    elevations above the earth, and it is explained by the science of\r\n    meteorology, to which it properly belongs; for it is not of cosmical\r\n    origin, and in no way pertains to astronomy, as most persons suppose,\r\n    except as it depends on the moon, whose light passing through the\r\n    atmosphere, produces the luminous halo, which as will be seen, is\r\n    simply an optical illusion, originating, not in the vicinity of the\r\n    moon--two hundred and forty thousand miles away--but just above the\r\n    earth's surface, and within the aqueous envelope that surrounds it on\r\n    all sides.... A halo may form round the sun as well as the moon ...\r\n    but a halo is more frequently noticed round the moon for the reason\r\n    that we are too much dazzled by the sun's light to distinguish faint\r\n    colours surrounding its disc, and to see them it is necessary to look\r\n    through smoked glass, or view the sun by reflection from the surface\r\n    of still water, by which its brilliancy is very much reduced.\"...\r\n\r\n\"A 'corona' is an appearance of faintly coloured rings often seen around\r\nthe sun and moon when a light fleecy cloud passes over them, and should\r\nnot be mistaken for a halo, which is much larger and more complicated in\r\nits structure. These two phenomena are frequently confounded by\r\ninexperienced observers.\" With these remarks the present writer fully\r\nconcurs.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartlett adds--\r\n\r\n    \"As a halo is never seen except when the sky is hazy, it indicates\r\n    that moisture is accumulating in the atmosphere which will form\r\n    clouds, and usually result in a storm. But the popular notion that the\r\n    number of bright stars visible within the circle indicates the number\r\n    of days before the storm will occur, is without any foundation\r\n    whatever, and the belief is almost too absurd to be refuted. In\r\n    whatever part of the sky a lunar halo is seen, one or more bright\r\n    stars are always sure to be noticed inside the luminous ring, and the\r\n    number visible depends entirely upon the position of the moon.\r\n    Moreover, when the sky within the circle is examined with even a small\r\n    telescope, hundreds of stars are visible where only one, or perhaps\r\n    two or three, are perceived with the naked eye.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible to have five Sundays in February (the year must of course\r\nbe a \"leap year\"). This occurred in the year 1880, Sunday falling on\r\nFebruary 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. But this will not happen again till the\r\nyear 1920. No century year (such as 1900, 2000, etc.) could possibly have\r\nfive Sundays in February, and the Rev. Richard Campbell, who investigated\r\nthis matter, finds the following sequence of years in which five Sundays\r\noccur in February: 1604, 1632, 1660, 1688, 1728, 1756, 1784, 1824, 1852,\r\n1880, 1920, 1948, 1976.[61]\r\n\r\nIn an article on \"The Last Day and Year of the Century: Remarks on Time\r\nReckoning,\" in _Nature_, September 10, 1896, Mr. W. T. Lynn, the eminent\r\nastronomer, says, \"The late Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, once\r\nreceived a letter requesting him to settle a dispute which had arisen in\r\nsome local debating society, as to which would be the first day of the\r\nnext century. His reply was, 'A very little consideration will suffice to\r\nshow that the first day of the twentieth century will be January 1, 1901.'\r\nSimple as the matter seems, the fact that it is occasionally brought into\r\nquestion shows that there is some little difficulty connected with it.\r\nProbably, however, this is in a great measure due to the circumstance that\r\nthe actual figures are changed on January 1, 1900, the day preceding being\r\nDecember 31, 1899. A century is a very definite word for an interval\r\nrespecting which there is no possible room for mistake or difference of\r\nopinion. But the date of its ending depends upon that of its beginning.\r\nOur double system of backward and forward reckoning leads to a good deal\r\nof inconvenience. Our reckoning supposes (what we know was not the case,\r\nbut as an era the date does equally well) that Christ was born at the end\r\nof B.C. 1. At the end of A.D. 1, therefore, one year had elapsed from the\r\nevent, at the end of A.D. 100, one century, and at the end of 1900,\r\nnineteen centuries.... It is clear, then, that the year, as we call it, is\r\nan ordinal number, and that 1900 years from the birth of Christ (reckoning\r\nas we do from B.C. 1) will not be completed until the end of December 31\r\nin that year, the twentieth century beginning with January 1, 1901, that\r\nis (to be exact) at the previous midnight, when the day commences by civil\r\nreckoning.\" With these remarks of Mr. Lynn I fully concur, and, so far as\r\nI know, all astronomers agree with him. As the discussion will probably\r\nagain arise at the end of the twentieth century, I would like to put on\r\nrecord here what the scientific opinion was at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nProf. E. Rutherford, the well-known authority on radium, suggests that\r\npossibly radium is a source of heat from within the earth. Traces of\r\nradium have been detected in many rocks and soils, and even in sea water.\r\nCalculation shows that the total amount distributed through the earth's\r\ncrust is enormously large, although relatively small \"compared with the\r\nannual output of coal for the world.\" The amount of radium necessary to\r\ncompensate for the present loss of heat from the earth \"corresponds to\r\nonly five parts in one hundred million millions per unit mass,\" and the\r\n\"observations of Elster and Gertel show that the radio-activity observed\r\nin soils corresponds to the presence of about this proportion of\r\nradium.\"[62]\r\n\r\nThe earth has 12 different motions. These are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Rotation on its axis, having a period of 24 hours.\r\n\r\n2. Revolution round the sun; period 365-1/4 days.\r\n\r\n3. Precession; period of about 25,765 years.\r\n\r\n4. Semi-lunar gravitation; period 28 days.\r\n\r\n5. Nutation; period 18-1/2 years.\r\n\r\n6. Variation in obliquity of the ecliptic; about 47\" in 100 years.\r\n\r\n7. Variation of eccentricity of orbit.\r\n\r\n8. Change of line of apsides; period about 21,000 years.\r\n\r\n9. Planetary perturbations.\r\n\r\n10. Change of centre of gravity of whole solar system.\r\n\r\n11. General motion of solar system in space.\r\n\r\n12. Variation of latitude with several degrees of periodicity.[63]\r\n\r\n    \"An amusing story has been told which affords a good illustration of\r\n    the ignorance and popular notions regarding the tides prevailing even\r\n    among persons of average intelligence. 'Tell me,' said a man to an\r\n    eminent living English astronomer not long ago, 'is it still\r\n    considered probable that the tides are caused by the moon?' The man of\r\n    science replied that to the best of his belief it was, and then asked\r\n    in turn whether the inquirer had any serious reason for questioning\r\n    the relationship. 'Well, I don't know,' was the answer; 'sometimes\r\n    when there is no moon there seems to be a tide all the same.'\"![64]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the force of gravitation, on the earth and other bodies\r\nin the universe, Mr. William B. Taylor has well said, \"With each revolving\r\nyear new demonstrations of its absolute precision and of its universal\r\ndomination serves only to fill the mind with added wonder and with added\r\nconfidence in the stability and the supremacy of the power in which has\r\nbeen found no variableness neither shadow of turning, but which--the same\r\nyesterday, to-day and for ever--\r\n\r\n  \"Lives through all life, extends through all extent,\r\n  Spreads undivided, operates unspent.\"[65]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the habitability of other planets, Tennyson has\r\nbeautifully said--\r\n\r\n  \"Venus near her! smiling downwards at this earthlier earth of ours,\r\n  Closer on the sun, perhaps a world of never fading flowers.\r\n  Hesper, whom the poets call'd the Bringer home of all good things;\r\n  All good things may move in Hesper; perfect people, perfect kings.\r\n  Hesper--Venus--were we native to that splendour, or in Mars,\r\n  We should see the globe we groan in fairest of their evening stars.\r\n  Could we dream of war and carnage, craft and madness, lust and spite,\r\n  Roaring London, raving Paris, in that spot of peaceful light?\r\n  Might we not in glancing heavenward on a star so silver fair,\r\n  Yearn and clasp the hands, and murmur, 'Would to God that we were\r\n      there!'\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek writer, Diogenes Laertius, states that Anaximander\r\n(610-547 B.C.) believed that the earth was a sphere. The Greek words are:\r\n[Greek: misên te tên gên keisthai, kentry taxin epechousan ousan\r\nsphairoeidê].[66]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Aurora Borealis, the exact nature of which is not\r\naccurately known, \"a good story used to be told some years ago of a\r\ncandidate who, undergoing the torture of a _vivâ voce_ examination, was\r\nunable to reply satisfactorily to any of the questions asked. 'Come, sir,'\r\nsaid the examiner, with the air of a man asking the simplest question,\r\n'explain to me the cause of the aurora borealis.' 'Sir,' said the unhappy\r\naspirant for physical honours, 'I could have explained it perfectly\r\nyesterday, but nervousness has, I think, made me lose my memory.' 'This is\r\nvery unfortunate,' said the examiner; 'you are the only man who could have\r\nexplained this mystery, and you have forgotten it.'\"[67] This was written\r\nin the year 1899, and probably the phenomenon of the aurora remains\r\nnearly as great a mystery to-day. In 1839, MM. Bravais and Lottin made\r\nobservations on the aurora in Norway in about N. latitude 70°. Bravais\r\nfound the height to be between 62 and 93 miles above the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the so-called Glacial Epoch in the earth's history has been\r\nmuch discussed. The Russian physicist, Rogovsky, has advanced the\r\nfollowing theory--\r\n\r\n    \"If we suppose that the temperature of the sun at the present time is\r\n    still increasing, or at least has been increasing until now, the\r\n    glacial epoch can be easily accounted for. Formerly the earth had a\r\n    high temperature of its own, but received a lesser quantity of heat\r\n    from the sun than now; on cooling gradually, the earth's surface\r\n    attained such a temperature as caused a great part of the surface of\r\n    the northern and southern hemispheres to be covered with ice; but the\r\n    sun's radiation increasing, the glaciers melted, and the climatic\r\n    conditions became as they are now. In a word, the temperature of the\r\n    earth's surface is a function of two quantities: one decreasing (the\r\n    earth's own heat), and the other increasing (the sun's radiation), and\r\n    consequently there may be a minimum, and this minimum was the glacial\r\n    epoch, which, as shown by recent investigations, those of Luigi de\r\n    Marchi (Report of _G. Schiaparelli, Meteorolog. Zeitschr._, 30,\r\n    130-136, 1895), are not local, but general for the whole earth\" (see\r\n    also M. Neumahr, _Erdegeschicht_).[68]\r\n\r\nProf. Percival Lowell thinks that the life of geological palæozoic times\r\nwas supported by the earth's internal heat, which maintained the ocean at\r\na comparatively warm temperature.[69]\r\n\r\nThe following passage in the Book of the Maccabees may possibly refer to\r\nan aurora--\r\n\r\n    \"Now about this time Antiochus made his second inroad into Egypt. And\r\n    it _so_ befell that throughout all the city, for the space of almost\r\n    forty days, there appeared in the midst of the sky horsemen in swift\r\n    motion, wearing robes inwrought with gold and _carrying_ spears,\r\n    equipped in troops for battle; and drawing of swords; and _on the\r\n    other side_ squadrons of horse in array; and encounters and pursuits\r\n    of both armies; and shaking of shields, and multitudes of lances, and\r\n    casting of darts, and flashing of golden trappings, and girding on of\r\n    all sorts of armour. Wherefore all men besought that the vision might\r\n    have been given for food.\"[70]\r\n\r\nAccording to Laplace \"the decrease of the mean heat of the earth during a\r\nperiod of 2000 years has not, taking the extremist limits, diminished as\r\nmuch as 1/300th of a degree Fahrenheit.\"[71]\r\n\r\nFrom his researches on the cause of the Precession of the Equinoxes,\r\nLaplace concluded that \"the motion of the earth's axis is the same as if\r\nthe whole sea formed a solid mass adhering to its surface.\"[72]\r\n\r\nLaplace found that the major (or longer) axis of the earth's orbit\r\ncoincided with the line of Equinoxes in the year 4107 B.C. The earth's\r\nperigee then coincided with the autumnal equinox. The epoch at which the\r\nmajor axis was perpendicular to the line of equinoxes fell in the year\r\n1250 A.D.[73]\r\n\r\nLeverrier has found the minimum eccentricity of the earth's orbit round\r\nthe sun to be 0·0047; so that the orbit will never become absolutely\r\ncircular, as some have imagined.\r\n\r\nLaplace says--\r\n\r\n    \"Astronomy considered in its entirety is the finest monument of the\r\n    human mind, the noblest essay of its intelligence. Seduced by the\r\n    illusions of the senses and of self-pride, for a long time man\r\n    considered himself as the centre of the movement of the stars; his\r\n    vain-glory has been punished by the terrors which his own ideas have\r\n    inspired. At last the efforts of several centuries brushed aside the\r\n    veil which concealed the system of the world. We discover ourselves\r\n    upon a planet, itself almost imperceptible in the vast extent of the\r\n    solar system, which in its turn is only an insensible point in the\r\n    immensity of space. The sublime results to which this discovery has\r\n    led should suffice to console us for our extreme littleness, and the\r\n    rank which it assigns to the earth. Let us treasure with solicitude,\r\n    let us add to as we may, this store of higher knowledge, the most\r\n    exquisite treasure of thinking beings.\"[74]\r\n\r\nWith reference to probable future changes in climate, the great physicist,\r\nArrhenius, says--\r\n\r\n    \"We often hear lamentation that the coal stored up in the earth is\r\n    wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future,\r\n    and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property\r\n    which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a\r\n    kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other\r\n    case, there is good mixed with evil. By the influence of the\r\n    increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope\r\n    to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as\r\n    regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will\r\n    bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit\r\n    of rapidly propagating mankind.\"[75]\r\n\r\nThe night of July 1, 1908, was unusually bright. This was noticed in\r\nvarious parts of England and Ireland, and by the present writer in Dublin.\r\nHumboldt states that \"at the time of the new moon at midnight in 1743, the\r\nphosphorescence was so intense that objects could be distinctly recognized\r\nat a distance of more than 600 feet.\"[76]\r\n\r\nAn interesting proof of the earth's rotation on its axis has recently been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n    \"In a paper in the _Proceedings_ of the Vienna Academy (June, 1908) by\r\n    Herr Tumlirz, it is shown mathematically that if a liquid is flowing\r\n    outwards between two horizontal discs, the lines of flow will be\r\n    strictly straight only if the discs and vessel be at rest, and will\r\n    assume certain curves if that vessel and the discs are in rotation,\r\n    as, for example, due to the earth's rotation. An experimental\r\n    arrangement was set up with all precautions, and the stream lines were\r\n    marked with coloured liquids and photographed. These were in general\r\n    accord with the predictions of theory and the supposition that the\r\n    earth is rotating about an axis.\"[77]\r\n\r\nIn a book published in 1905 entitled _The Rational Almanac_, by Moses B.\r\nCotsworth, of York, the author states that (p. 397), \"The explanation is\r\napparent from the Great Pyramid's Slope, which conclusively proves that\r\nwhen it was built the latitude of that region was 7°·1 more than at\r\npresent. Egyptian Memphis now near Cairo was then in latitude 37°·1, where\r\nAsia Minor now ranges, whilst Syria would then be where the Caucasus\r\nregions now experience those rigorous winters formerly experienced in\r\nSyria.\" But the reality of this comparatively great change of latitude in\r\nthe position of the Great Pyramid can be easily disproved. Pytheas of\r\nMarseilles--who lived in the time of Alexander the Great, about 330\r\nB.C.--measured the latitude of Marseilles by means of a gnomon, and found\r\nit to be about 42° 56'-1/2. As the present latitude of Marseilles is 43°\r\n17' 50\", no great change in the latitude could have taken place in over\r\n2000 years.[78] From this we may conclude that the latitude of the Great\r\nPyramid has _not_ changed by 7°·1 since its construction. There is, it is\r\ntrue, a slow diminution going on in the obliquity of the ecliptic (or\r\ninclination of the earth's axis), but modern observations show that this\r\nwould not amount to as much as one degree in 6000 years. Eudemus of\r\nRhodes--a disciple of Aristotle (who died in 322 B.C.)--found the\r\nobliquity of the ecliptic to be 24°, which differs but little from its\r\npresent value, 23° 27'. Al-Sufi in the tenth century measured the latitude\r\nof Schiraz in Persia, and found it 29° 36'. Its present latitude is 29°\r\n36' 30\",[79] so that evidently there has been no change in the latitude in\r\n900 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total area of the moon's surface is about equal to that of North and\r\nSouth America. The actual surface visible at any one time is about equal\r\nto North America.\r\n\r\nThe famous lunar observer, Schröter, thought that the moon had an\r\natmosphere, but estimated its height at only a little over a mile. Its\r\ndensity he supposed to be less than that of the vacuum in an air-pump.\r\nRecent investigations, however, seem to show that owing to its small mass\r\nand attractive force the moon could not retain an atmosphere like that of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nProf. N. S. Shaler, of Harvard (U.S.A.), finds from a study of the moon\r\n(from a geological point of view) with the 15-inch refractor of the\r\nHarvard Observatory, that our satellite has no atmosphere nor any form of\r\norganic life, and he believes that its surface \"was brought to its present\r\ncondition before the earth had even a solid crust.\"[80]\r\n\r\nThere is a curious illusion with reference to the moon's apparent\r\ndiameter referred to by Proctor.[81] If, when the moon is absent in the\r\nwinter months, we ask a person whether the moon's diameter is greater or\r\nless than the distance between the stars [Greek: d] and [Greek: e], and\r\n[Greek: e] and [Greek: z] Orionis, the three well-known stars in the \"belt\r\nof Orion,\" the answer will probably be that the moon's apparent diameter\r\nis about equal to each of these distances. But in reality the apparent\r\ndistance between [Greek: d] and [Greek: e] Orionis (or between [Greek: e]\r\nand [Greek: z], which is about the same) is more than double the moon's\r\napparent diameter. This seems at first sight a startling statement; but\r\nits truth is, of course, beyond all doubt and is not open to argument.\r\nProctor points out that if a person estimates the moon as a foot in\r\ndiameter, as its apparent diameter is about half a degree, this would\r\nimply that the observer estimates the circumference of the star sphere as\r\nabout 720 feet (360° × 2), and hence the radius (or the moon's distance\r\nfrom the earth) about 115 feet. But in reality all such estimates have no\r\nscientific (that is, accurate) meaning. Some of the ancients, such as\r\nAristotle, Cicero, and Heraclitus, seem to have estimated the moon's\r\napparent diameter at about a foot.[82] This shows that even great minds\r\nmay make serious mistakes.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by some writer that the moon as seen with the highest\r\npowers of the great Yerkes telescope (40 inches aperture) appears \"just\r\nas it would be seen with the naked eye if it were suspended 60 miles over\r\nour heads.\" But this statement is quite erroneous. The moon as seen with\r\nthe naked eye or with a telescope shows us nearly a whole hemisphere of\r\nits surface. But if the eye were placed only 60 miles from the moon's\r\nsurface, we should see only a small portion of its surface. In fact, it is\r\na curious paradox that the nearer the eye is to a sphere the less we see\r\nof its surface! The truth of this will be evident from the fact that on a\r\nlevel plain an eye placed at a height, say 5 feet, sees a very small\r\nportion indeed of the earth's surface, and the higher we ascend the more\r\nof the surface we see. I find that at a distance of 60 miles from the\r\nmoon's surface we should only see a small portion of its visible\r\nhemisphere (about 1/90th). The lunar features would also appear under a\r\ndifferent aspect. The view would be more of a landscape than that seen in\r\nany telescope. This view of the matter is not new. It has been previously\r\npointed out, especially by M. Flammarion and Mr. Whitmell, but its truth\r\nis not, I think, generally recognized. Prof. Newcomb doubts whether with\r\nany telescope the moon has ever been seen so well as it would be if\r\nbrought within 500 miles of the earth.\r\n\r\nA relief map of the moon 19 feet in diameter was added, in 1898, to the\r\nField Columbian Museum (U.S.A.). It was prepared with great care from the\r\nlunar charts of Beer and Mädler, and Dr. Schmidt of the Athens\r\nObservatory, and it shows the lunar features very accurately. Its\r\nconstruction took five years.\r\n\r\nOn a photograph of a part of the moon's surface near the crater\r\nEratosthenes, Prof. William H. Pickering finds markings which very much\r\nresemble the so-called \"canals\" of Mars. The photograph was taken in\r\nJamaica, and a copy of it is given in Prof. Pickering's book on the Moon,\r\nand in _Popular Astronomy_, February, 1904.\r\n\r\nExperiments made in America by Messrs. Stebbins and F. C. Brown, by means\r\nof selenium cells, show that the light of the full moon is about nine\r\ntimes that of the half moon;[83] and that \"the moon is brighter between\r\nthe first quarter and full than in the corresponding phase after full\r\nmoon.\" They also find that the light of the full moon is equal to \"0·23\r\ncandle power,\"[83] that is, according to the method of measurement used in\r\nAmerica, its light is equal to 0·23 of a standard candle placed at a\r\ndistance of one metre (39·37 inches) from the eye.[84]\r\n\r\nMr. H. H. Kimball finds that no less than 52 per cent. of the observed\r\nchanges in intensity of the \"earth-shine\" visible on the moon when at or\r\nnear the crescent phase is due to the eccentricity of the lunar orbit,\r\nand \"this is probably much greater than could be expected from any\r\nincrease or diminution in the average cloudiness over the hemisphere of\r\nthe earth reflecting light to the moon.\"[85]\r\n\r\nThe \"moon maiden\" is a term applied to a fancied resemblance of a portion\r\nof the Sinus Iridum to a female head. It forms the \"promontory\" known as\r\nCape Heraclides, and may be looked for when the moon's \"age\" is about 11\r\ndays. Mr. C. J. Caswell, who observed it on September 29, 1895, describes\r\nit as resembling \"a beautiful silver statuette of a graceful female figure\r\nwith flowing hair.\"\r\n\r\nM. Landerer finds that the angle of polarization of the moon's\r\nsurface--about 33°--agrees well with the polarizing angle for many\r\nspecimens of igneous rocks (30° 51' to 33° 46'). The polarizing angle for\r\nice is more than 37°, and this fact is opposed to the theories of lunar\r\nglaciation advanced by some observers.[86]\r\n\r\nKepler states in his _Somnium_ that he saw the moon in the crescent phase\r\non the morning and evening of the _same_ day (that is, before and after\r\nconjunction with the sun). Kepler could see 14 stars in the Pleiades with\r\nthe naked eye, so his eyesight must have been exceptionally keen.\r\n\r\nInvestigations on ancient eclipses of the moon show that the eclipse\r\nmentioned by Josephus as having occurred before the death of Herod is\r\nprobably that which took place on September 15, B.C. 5. This occurred\r\nabout 9.45 p.m.; and probably about six months before the death of Herod\r\n(St. Matthew ii. 15).\r\n\r\nThe total lunar eclipse which occurred on October 4, 1884, was remarkable\r\nfor the almost total disappearance of the moon during totality. One\r\nobserver says that \"in the open air, if one had not known exactly where to\r\nlook for it, one might have searched for some time without discovering it.\r\nI speak of course of the naked eye appearance.\"[87] On the other hand the\r\nsame observer, speaking of the total eclipse of the moon on August 23,\r\n1877, which was a bright one, says--\r\n\r\n    \"The moon even in the middle of the total phase was a conspicuous\r\n    object in the sky, and the ruddy colour was well marked. In the very\r\n    middle of the eclipse the degree of illumination was as nearly as\r\n    possible equal all round the edge of the moon, the central parts being\r\n    darker than those near the edge.\"\r\n\r\nIn Roger de Hovedin's _Chronicle_ (A.D. 756) an account is given of the\r\noccultation of \"a bright star,\" by the moon during a total eclipse. This\r\nis confirmed by Simeon of Durham, who also dates the eclipse A.D. 756.\r\nThis is, however, a mistake, the eclipse having occurred on the evening of\r\nNovember 23, A.D. 755. Calvisius supposed that the occulted \"star\" might\r\nhave been Aldebaran. Pingré, however, showed that this was impossible, and\r\nStruyck, in 1740, showed that the planet Jupiter was the \"star\" referred\r\nto by the early observer. Further calculations by Hind (1885) show\r\nconclusively that Struyck was quite correct, and that the phenomenon\r\ndescribed in the old chronicles was the occultation of Jupiter by a\r\ntotally eclipsed moon--a rather unique phenomenon.[88]\r\n\r\nAn occultation of Mars by the moon is recorded by the Chinese, on February\r\n14, B.C. 69, and one of Venus, on March 30, A.D. 361. These have also been\r\nverified by Hind, and his calculations show the accuracy of these old\r\nChinese records.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the moon may possibly have a satellite\r\nrevolving round it, as the moon itself revolves round the earth. This\r\nwould, of course, form an object of great interest. During the total lunar\r\neclipses of March 10 and September 3, 1895, a careful photographic search\r\nwas made by Prof. Barnard for a possible lunar satellite. The eclipse of\r\nMarch 10 was not very suitable for the purpose owing to a hazy sky, but\r\nthat of September 3 was \"entirely satisfactory,\" as the sky was very\r\nclear, and the duration of totality was very long. On the latter occasion\r\n\"six splendid\" photographs were obtained of the total phase with a 6-inch\r\nWillard lens. The result was that none of these photographs \"show\r\nanything which might be taken for a lunar satellite,\" at least any\r\nsatellite as bright as the 10th or 12th magnitude. It is, of course, just\r\npossible that the supposed satellite might have been behind the moon\r\nduring the totality.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the attraction between the earth and moon, Sir Oliver\r\nLodge says--\r\n\r\n    \"The force with which the moon is held in its orbit would be great\r\n    enough to tear asunder a steel rod 400 miles thick, with a tenacity of\r\n    30 tons to the square inch, so that if the moon and earth were\r\n    connected by steel instead of gravity, a forest of pillars would be\r\n    necessary to whirl the system once a month round their common centre\r\n    of gravity. Such a force necessarily implies enormous tensure or\r\n    pressure in the medium. Maxwell calculates that the gravitational\r\n    stress near the earth, which we must suppose to exist in the invisible\r\n    medium, is 3000 times greater than what the strongest steel can stand,\r\n    and near the sun it should be 2500 times as great as that.\"[89]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the names given to \"craters\" on the moon, Prof. W. H.\r\nPickering says,[90] \"The system of nomenclature is, I think, unfortunate.\r\nThe names of the chief craters are generally those of men who have done\r\nlittle or nothing for selenography, or even for astronomy, while the men\r\nwho should be really commemorated are represented in general by small and\r\nunimportant craters,\" and again--\r\n\r\n    \"A serious objection to the whole system of nomenclature lies in the\r\n    fact that it has apparently been used by some selenographers, from the\r\n    earliest times up to the present, as a means of satisfying their spite\r\n    against some of their contemporaries. Under the guise of pretending to\r\n    honour them by placing their names in perpetuity upon the moon, they\r\n    have used their names merely to designate the smallest objects that\r\n    their telescopes were capable of showing. An interesting illustration\r\n    of this point is found in the craters of Galileo and Riccioli, which\r\n    lie close together on the moon. It will be remembered that Galileo was\r\n    the discoverer of the craters on the moon. Both names were given by\r\n    Riccioli, and the relative size and importance of the craters\r\n    [Riccioli large, and Galileo very small] probably indicates to us the\r\n    relative importance that he assigned to the two men themselves. Other\r\n    examples might be quoted of craters named in the same spirit after men\r\n    still living.... With the exception of Maedler, one might almost say,\r\n    the more prominent the selenographer the more insignificant the\r\n    crater.\"\r\n\r\nThe mathematical treatment of the lunar theory is a problem of great\r\ndifficulty. The famous mathematician, Euler, described it as _incredibile\r\nstadium atque indefessus labor_.[91]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the \"earth-shine\" on the moon when in the crescent\r\nphase, Humboldt says, \"Lambert made the remarkable observation (14th of\r\nFebruary, 1774) of a change of the ash-coloured moonlight into an\r\nolive-green colour, bordering upon yellow. The moon, which then stood\r\nvertically over the Atlantic Ocean, received upon its night side the green\r\nterrestrial light, which is reflected towards her when the sky is clear by\r\nthe forest districts of South America.\"[92] Arago said, \"Il n'est donc pas\r\nimpossible, malgré tout ce qu'un pareil résultat exciterait de surprise au\r\npremier coup d'oeil qu'un jour les météorologistes aillent puiser dans\r\nl'aspect de la Lune des notions précieuses sur _l'etat moyen_ de\r\ndiaphanité de l'atmosphère terrestre, dans les hemisphères qui\r\nsuccessivement concurrent à la production de la lumière cendrée.\"[93]\r\n\r\nThe \"earth-shine\" on the new moon was successfully photographed in\r\nFebruary, 1895, by Prof. Barnard at the Lick Observatory, with a 6-inch\r\nWillard portrait lens. He says--\r\n\r\n    \"The earth-lit globe stands out beautifully round, encircled by the\r\n    slender crescent. All the 'seas' are conspicuously visible, as are\r\n    also the other prominent features, especially the region about\r\n    _Tycho_. _Aristarchus_ and _Copernicus_ appear as bright specks, and\r\n    the light streams from _Tycho_ are very distinct.\"[94]\r\n\r\nKepler found that the moon completely disappeared during the total eclipse\r\nof December 9, 1601, and Hevelius observed the same phenomenon during the\r\neclipse of April 25, 1642, when \"not a vestige of the moon could be\r\nseen.\"[95] In the total lunar eclipse of June 10, 1816, the moon during\r\ntotality was not visible in London, even with a telescope![95]\r\n\r\nThe lunar mountains are _relatively_ much higher than those on the earth.\r\nBeer and Mädler found the following heights: Dörfel, 23,174 feet; Newton,\r\n22,141; Casatus, 21,102; Curtius, 20,632; Callippus, 18,946; and Tycho,\r\n18,748 feet.[96]\r\n\r\nTaking the earth's diameter at 7912 miles, the moon's diameter, 2163\r\nmiles, and the height of Mount Everest as 29,000 feet, I find that\r\n\r\n      Everest          1            Dörfel        1\r\n  ---------------- = ----, and --------------- = ---\r\n  Earth's diameter   1440      moon's diameter   492\r\n\r\nFrom which it follows that the lunar mountains are _proportionately_ about\r\nthree times higher than those on the earth.\r\n\r\nAccording to an hypothesis recently advanced by Dr. See, all the\r\nsatellites of the solar system, including our moon, were \"captured\" by\r\ntheir primaries. He thinks, therefore, that the \"moon came to earth from\r\nheavenly space.\"[97]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMars\r\n\r\n\r\nMars was called by the ancients \"the vanishing star,\" owing to the long\r\nperiods during which it is practically invisible from the earth.[98] It\r\nwas also called [Greek: puroeis] and Hercules.\r\n\r\nI have seen it stated in a book on the \"Solar System\" by a well-known\r\nastronomer that the _axis_ of Mars \"is inclined to the plane of the orbit\"\r\nat an angle of 24° 50'! But this is quite erroneous. The angle given is\r\nthe angle between _the plane of the planet's equator_ and the plane of its\r\norbit, which is quite a different thing. This angle, which may be called\r\nthe obliquity of Mars' ecliptic, does not differ much from that of the\r\nearth. Lowell finds it 23° 13' from observations in 1907.[99]\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Proctor thought that Mars is \"far the reddest star in the\r\nheavens; Aldebaran and Antares are pale beside him.\"[100] But this does\r\nnot agree with my experience. Antares is to my eye quite as red as Mars.\r\nIts name is derived from two Greek words implying \"redder than Mars.\" The\r\ncolour of Aldebaran is, I think, quite comparable with that of the \"ruddy\r\nplanet.\" In the telescope the colour of Mars is, I believe, more yellow\r\nthan red, but I have not seen the planet very often in a telescope. Sir\r\nJohn Herschel suggested that the reddish colour of Mars may possibly be\r\ndue to red rocks, like those of the Old Red Sandstone, and the red soil\r\noften associated with such rocks, as I have myself noticed near Torquay\r\nand other places in Devonshire.\r\n\r\nThe ruddy colour of Mars was formerly thought to be due to the great\r\ndensity of its atmosphere. But modern observations seem to show that the\r\nplanet's atmosphere is, on the contrary, much rarer than that of the\r\nearth. The persistent visibility of the markings on its surface shows that\r\nits atmosphere cannot be cloud-laden like ours; and the spectroscope shows\r\nthat the water vapour present is--although perceptible--less than that of\r\nour terrestrial envelope.\r\n\r\nThe existence of water vapour is clearly shown by photographs of the\r\nplanet's spectrum taken by Mr. Slipher at the Lowell Observatory in 1908.\r\nThese show that the water vapour bands _a_ and near D are stronger in the\r\nspectrum of Mars than in that of the moon at the same altitude.[101]\r\n\r\nThe dark markings on Mars were formerly supposed to represent water and\r\nthe light parts land. But this idea has now been abandoned. Light\r\nreflected from a water surface is polarized at certain angles. Prof. W. H.\r\nPickering, in his observations on Mars, finds no trace of polarization in\r\nthe light reflected from the dark parts of the planet. But under the same\r\nconditions he finds that the bluish-black ring surrounding the white polar\r\ncap shows a well-marked polarization of light, thus indicating that this\r\ndark ring is probably water.[102]\r\n\r\nProjections on the limb of the planet have frequently been observed in\r\nAmerica. These are known _not_ to be mountains, as they do not reappear\r\nunder similar conditions. They are supposed to be clouds, and one seen in\r\nDecember, 1900, has been explained as a cloud lying at a height of some 13\r\nmiles above the planet's surface and drifting at the rate of about 27\r\nmiles an hour. If there are any mountains on Mars they have not yet been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the so-called \"canals\" of Mars is supposed to be\r\nconfirmed by Lowell's photographs of the planet. But what these \"canals\"\r\nreally represent, that is the question. They have certainly an artificial\r\nlook about them, and they form one of the most curious and interesting\r\nproblems in the heavens. Prof. Lowell says--\r\n\r\n    \"Most suggestive of all Martian phenomena are the canals. Were they\r\n    more generally observable the world would have been spared much\r\n    scepticism and more theory. They may of course not be artificial, but\r\n    observations here [Flagstaff] indicate that they are; as will, I\r\n    think, appear from the drawings. For it is one thing to see two or\r\n    three canals and quite another to have the planet's disc mapped with\r\n    them on a most elaborate system of triangulation. In the first place\r\n    they are this season (August, 1894) bluish-green, of the same colour\r\n    as the seas into which the longer ones all eventually debouch. In the\r\n    next place they are almost without exception geodetically straight,\r\n    supernaturally so, and this in spite of their leading in every\r\n    possible direction. Then they are of apparently nearly uniform width\r\n    throughout their length. What they are is another matter. Their mere\r\n    aspect, however, is enough to cause all theories about glaciation\r\n    fissures or surface cracks to die an instant and natural death.\"[103]\r\n\r\nSome of the observed colour-changes on Mars are very curious. In April,\r\n1905, Mr. Lowell observed that the marking known as Mare Erythræum, just\r\nabove Syrtis, had \"changed from a blue-green to a chocolate-brown colour.\"\r\nThe season on Mars corresponded with our February.\r\n\r\nSignor V. Cerulli says that, having observed Mars regularly for ten years,\r\nhe has come to the conclusion that the actual existence of the \"canals\" is\r\nas much a subject for physiological as for astronomical investigation. He\r\nstates that \"the phenomena observed are so near the limit of the range of\r\nthe human eye that in observing them one really experiences an effect\r\naccompanying the 'birth of vision.' That is to say, the eye sees more and\r\nmore as it becomes accustomed, or strained, to the delicate markings, and\r\nthus the joining up of spots to form 'canals' and the gemination of the\r\nlatter follow as a physiological effect, and need not necessarily be\r\nsubjective phenomena seen by the unaccustomed eye.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThe possibility of life on Mars has been recently much discussed; some\r\ndenying, others asserting. M. E. Rogovsky says--\r\n\r\n    \"As free oxygen and carbonic dioxide may exist in the atmosphere of\r\n    _Mars_, vegetable and animal life is quite possible. If the\r\n    temperature which prevails upon _Mars_ is nearer to -36° C. than to\r\n    -73° C., the existence of living beings like ourselves is possible. In\r\n    fact, the ice of some Greenland and Alpine glaciers is covered by red\r\n    algæ (_Sphærella nivalis_); we find there also different species of\r\n    rotaloria, variegated spiders, and other animals on the snow fields\r\n    illuminated by the sun; at the edges of glacier snows in the Tyrol we\r\n    see violet bells of _Soldanella pusilla_, the stalks of which make\r\n    their way through the snow by producing heat which melts it round\r\n    about them. Finally the Siberian town Verkhociansk, near Yakutsk,\r\n    exists, though the temperature there falls to -69°·8 C. and the mean\r\n    temperature of January to -51°·2, and the mean pressure of the vapour\r\n    of water is less than 0·05mm. It is possible, therefore, that living\r\n    beings have become adapted to the conditions now prevailing upon\r\n    _Mars_ after the lapse of many ages, and live at an even lower\r\n    temperature than upon the earth, developing the necessary heat\r\n    themselves.\"\r\n\r\nM. Rogovsky adds, \"Water in organisms is mainly a liquid or solvent, and\r\nmany other liquids may be the same. We have no reason to believe that life\r\nis possible only under the same conditions and with the same chemical\r\ncomposition of organisms as upon the earth, although indeed we cannot\r\naffirm that they actually exist on Mars.\"[105] With the above views the\r\npresent writer fully concurs.\r\n\r\nProf. Lowell thinks that the polar regions of Mars, both north and south,\r\nare actually warmer than the corresponding regions of the earth, although\r\nthe mean temperature of the planet is probably twelve degrees lower than\r\nthe earth's mean temperature.[106]\r\n\r\nA writer in _Astronomy and Astrophysics_ (1892, p. 748) says--\r\n\r\n    \"Whether the planet Mars is inhabited or not seems to be the\r\n    all-absorbing question with the ordinary reader. With the astronomer\r\n    this query is almost the last thing about the planet that he would\r\n    think of when he has an opportunity to study its surface markings ...\r\n    no astronomer claims to know whether the planet is inhabited or not.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral suggestions have been made with reference to the possibility of\r\nsignalling to Mars. But, as Mr. Larkin of Mount Lowe (U.S.A.) points out,\r\nall writers on this subject seem to forget the fact that the night side of\r\ntwo planets are never turned towards each other. \"When the sun is between\r\nthem it is day on the side of Mars which is towards us, and also day on\r\nthe side of the earth which is towards Mars. When they are on the same\r\nside of the sun, it is day on Mars when night on the earth, and for this\r\nreason they could never see our signals. This should make it apparent that\r\nthe task of signalling to Mars is a more difficult one than the most\r\nhopeful theorist has probably considered. All this is under the\r\nsupposition that the Martians (if there are such) are beings like\r\nourselves. If they are not like us, we cannot guess what they are\r\nlike.\"[107] These views seem to me to be undoubtedly correct, and show the\r\nfutility of visual signals. Electricity might, however, be conceivably\r\nused for the purpose; but even this seems highly improbable.\r\n\r\nProf. Newcomb, in his work _Astronomy for Everybody_, says with reference\r\nto this question, \"The reader will excuse me from saying nothing in this\r\nchapter about the possible inhabitants of Mars. He knows just as much\r\nabout the subject as I do, and that is nothing at all.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, quite possible that life _in some form_ may exist on Mars.\r\nAs Lowell well says, \"Life but waits in the wings of existence for its cue\r\nto enter the scene the moment the stage is set.\"[108] With reference to\r\nthe \"canals\" he says--\r\n\r\n    \"It is certainly no exaggeration to say that they are the most\r\n    astonishing objects to be viewed in the heavens. There are celestial\r\n    sights more dazzling, spectacles that inspire more awe, but to the\r\n    thoughtful observer who is privileged to see them well, there is\r\n    nothing in the sky so profoundly impressive as these canals of\r\n    Mars.\"[109]\r\n\r\nThe eminent Swedish physicist Arrhenius thinks that the mean annual\r\ntemperature on Mars may possibly be as high as 50° F. He says, \"Sometimes\r\nthe snow-caps on the poles of Mars disappear entirely during the Mars\r\nsummer; this never happens on our terrestrial poles. The mean temperature\r\nof Mars must therefore be above zero, probably about +10° [Centigrade =\r\n50° Fahrenheit]. Organic life may very probably thrive, therefore, on\r\nMars.\"[110] He thinks that this excess of mean temperature above the\r\ncalculated temperature may be due to an increased amount of carbonic acid\r\nin the planet's atmosphere, and says \"any doubling of the percentage of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth's\r\nsurface by 4°; and if the carbon dioxide were increased fourfold, the\r\ntemperature would rise by 8°.\"[111]\r\n\r\nDenning says,--[112]\r\n\r\n    \"A few years ago, when christening celestial formations was more in\r\n    fashion than it is now, a man simply had to use a telescope for an\r\n    evening or two on Mars or the moon, and spice the relation of his\r\n    seeings with something in the way of novelty, when his name would be\r\n    pretty certainly attached to an object and hung in the heavens for all\r\n    time! A writer in the _Astronomical Register_ for January, 1879,\r\n    humorously suggested that 'the matter should be put into the hands of\r\n    an advertising agent,' and 'made the means of raising a revenue for\r\n    astronomical purposes.' Some men would not object to pay handsomely\r\n    for the distinction of having their names applied to the seas and\r\n    continents of Mars or the craters of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nAn occultation of Mars by the moon is recorded by Aristotle as having\r\noccurred on April 4, 357 B.C.[113]\r\n\r\nSeen from Mars the maximum apparent distance between the earth and moon\r\nwould vary from 3-1/2' to nearly 17'.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Minor Planets\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to 1908 the number of minor planets (or asteroids) certainly known\r\namounted to over 650.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the distribution of the first 512 of these small\r\nbodies, Dr. P. Stroobant finds that a decided maximum in number occurs\r\nbetween the limits of distance of 2·55 and 2·85 (earth's mean distance\r\nfrom sun = 1), \"199 of the asteroids considered revolving in this\r\nannulus.\" He finds that nearly all the asteroidal matter is concentrated\r\nnear to the middle of the ring in the neighbourhood of the mean distance\r\nof 2·7, and the smallest asteroids are relatively less numerous in the\r\nrichest zones.[115]\r\n\r\nThere are some \"striking similarities\" in the orbits of some of the\r\nasteroids. Thus, in the small planets Sophia (No. 251 in order of\r\ndiscovery) and Magdalena (No. 318) we have the mean distance of Sophia\r\n3·10, and that of Magdalena 3·19 (earth's mean distance = 1). The\r\neccentricities of the orbits are 0·09 and 0·07; and the inclinations of\r\nthe orbits to the plane of the ecliptic 10° 29' and 10° 33'\r\nrespectively.[116] This similarity may be--and probably is--merely\r\naccidental, but it is none the less curious and interesting.\r\n\r\nSome very interesting discoveries have recently been made among the minor\r\nplanets. The orbit of Eros intersects the orbit of Mars; and the following\r\nhave nearly the same mean distance from the sun as Jupiter:--\r\n\r\n  Achilles (1906 TG), No. 588,\r\n  Patrocles (1906 XY), No. 617,\r\n  Hector (1907 XM), No. 624,\r\n\r\nand another (No. 659) has been recently found. Each of these small planets\r\n\"moves approximately in a vertex of an equilateral triangle that it forms\r\nwith Jupiter and the sun.\"[117] The minor planet known provisionally as HN\r\nis remarkable for the large eccentricity of its orbit (0·38), and its\r\nsmall perihelion distance (1·6). When discovered it had a very high South\r\nDeclination (61-1/2°), showing that the inclination of the plane of its\r\norbit to the plane of the ecliptic is considerable.[118]\r\n\r\nDr. Bauschinger has made a study of the minor planets discovered up to the\r\nend of 1900. He finds that the ascending nodes of the orbits show a\r\nmarked tendency to cluster near the ascending node of Jupiter's orbit, a\r\nfact which agrees well with Prof. Newcomb's theoretical results. There\r\nseems to be a slight tendency for large inclinations and great\r\neccentricities to go together; but there appears to be no connection\r\nbetween the eccentricity and the mean distance from the sun. The\r\nlongitudes of the perihelia of these small planets \"show a well-marked\r\nmaximum near the longitude of _Jupiter's_ perihelion, and equally\r\nwell-marked minimum near the longitude of his aphelion,\" which is again in\r\ngood agreement with Newcomb's calculations.[119] Dr. Bauschinger's\r\ndiameter for Eros is 20 miles. He finds that the whole group, including\r\nthose remaining to be discovered, would probably form a sphere of about\r\n830 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe total mass of the minor planets has been frequently estimated, but\r\ngenerally much too high. Mr. B. M. Roszel of the John Hopkins University\r\n(U.S.A.) has made a calculation of the probable mass from the known\r\ndiameter of Vesta (319 miles, Pickering), and finds the volume of the\r\nfirst 216 asteroids discovered. From this calculation it appears that it\r\nwould take 310 asteroids of the 6th magnitude, or 1200 of the 7th to equal\r\nthe moon in volume. Mr. Roszel concludes that the probable mass of the\r\nwhole asteroidal belt is between 1/50th and 1/100th of that of the\r\nmoon.[120] Subsequently Mr. Roszel extended his study to the mass of 311\r\nasteroids,[121] and found a combined mass of about 1/40th of the moon's\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nDr. Palisa finds that the recently discovered minor planet (1905 QY)\r\nvaries in light to a considerable extent.[122] This planet was discovered\r\nby Dr. Max Wolf on August 23, 1905; but it was subsequently found that it\r\nis identical with one previously known, (167) Urda.[123] The light\r\nvariation is said to be from the 11th to the 13th magnitude.[124]\r\nVariation in some of the other minor planets has also been suspected.\r\nProf. Wendell found a variation of about half a magnitude in the planet\r\nEunomia (No. 15). He also found that Iris (No. 7) varies about a quarter\r\nof a magnitude in a period of about 6{h} 12{m}.[125] But these variations\r\nare small, and perhaps doubtful. The variability of Eros is well known.\r\n\r\nThe planet Eros is a very interesting one. The perihelion portion of its\r\norbit lies between the orbits of Mars and the earth, and the aphelion part\r\nis outside the orbit of Mars. Owing to the great variation in its distance\r\nfrom the earth the brightness of Eros varies from the 6th to the 12th\r\nmagnitude. That is, when brightest, it is 250 times brighter than when it\r\nis faintest.[126] This variation of light, is of course, merely due to the\r\nvariation of distance; but some actual variation in the brightness of the\r\nplanet has been observed.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown by Oeltzen and Valz that Cacciatore's supposed distant\r\ncomet, mentioned by Admiral Smyth in his _Bedford Catalogue_, must have\r\nbeen a minor planet.[127]\r\n\r\nDr. Max Wolf discovered 36 new minor planets by photography in the years\r\n1892-95. Up to the latter year he had never seen one of these through a\r\ntelescope! His words are, \"Ich selsbt habe noch nie einen meinen kleinen\r\nPlaneten am Himmel gesehen.\"[128]\r\n\r\nThese small bodies have now become so numerous that it is a matter of much\r\ndifficulty to follow them. At the meeting of the Royal Astronomical\r\nSociety on January 8, 1909, Mr. G. F. Chambers made the following\r\nfacetious remarks--\r\n\r\n    \"I would like to make a suggestion that has been in my mind for\r\n    several years past--that it should be made an offence punishable by\r\n    fine or imprisonment to discover any more minor planets. They seem to\r\n    be an intolerable nuisance, and are a great burden upon the literary\r\n    gentlemen who have to keep pace with them and record them. I have\r\n    never seen, during the last few years at any rate, any good come from\r\n    them, or likely to come, and I should like to see the supply stopped,\r\n    and the energies of the German gentlemen who find so many turned into\r\n    more promising channels.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the minor planets numbered 1 to 500, about 40 \"have not been seen\r\nsince the year of their discovery, and must be regarded as lost.\"[129]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nJupiter\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brilliant planet--only inferior to Venus in brightness--was often\r\nseen by Bond (Jun.) with the naked eye in \"high and clear sunshine\"; also\r\nby Denning, who has very keen eyesight. Its brightness on such occasions\r\nis so great, that--like Venus--it casts a distinct shadow in a dark\r\nroom.[130]\r\n\r\nThe great \"red spot\" on Jupiter seems to have been originally discovered\r\nby Robert Hooke on May 9, 1664, with a telescope of 2 inches aperture and\r\n12 feet focus. It seems to have existed ever since; at least the evidence\r\nis, according to Denning, in favour of the identity of Hooke's spot with\r\nthe red spot visible in recent years. The spot was also observed by\r\nCassini in the years 1665-72, and is sometimes called \"Cassini's spot.\"\r\nBut the real discoverer was Hooke.[131]\r\n\r\nThe orbit of Jupiter is so far outside the earth's orbit that there can\r\nbe little visible in the way of \"phase\"--as in the case of Mars, where the\r\n\"gibbous\" phase is sometimes very perceptible. Some books on astronomy\r\nstate that Jupiter shows no phase. But this is incorrect. A distinct,\r\nalthough very slight, gibbous appearance is visible when the planet is\r\nnear quadrature. Webb thought it more conspicuous in twilight than in a\r\ndark sky. With large telescopes, Jupiter's satellites II. and III. have\r\nbeen seen--in consequence of Jupiter's phase--to emerge from occultation\r\n\"at a sensible distance from the limb.\"[132]\r\n\r\nAccording to M. E. Rogovsky, the high \"albedo of Jupiter, the appearance\r\nof the clear (red) and dark spots on its surface and their continual\r\nvariation, the different velocity of rotation of the equatorial and other\r\nzones of its surface, and particularly its small density (1·33, water as\r\nunity), all these facts afford irrefragable proofs of the high temperature\r\nof this planet. The dense and opaque atmosphere hides its glowing surface\r\nfrom our view, and we see therefore only the external surface of its\r\nclouds. The objective existence of this atmosphere is proved by the bands\r\nand lines of absorption in its spectrum. The interesting photograph\r\nobtained by Draper, September 27, 1879, in which the blue and green parts\r\nare more brilliant for the equatorial zone than for the adjacent parts of\r\nthe surface, appears to show that _Jupiter_ emits its proper light. It is\r\npossible that the constant red spot noticed on its surface by several\r\nobservers, as Gledhill, Lord Rosse, and Copeland (1873), Russel and\r\nBredikhin (1876), is the summit of a high glowing mountain. G. W. Hough\r\nconsiders Jupiter to be gaseous, and A. Ritter inferred from his formulæ\r\nthat in this case the temperature at the centre would be 600,000° C.\"[133]\r\n\r\nThe four brighter satellites of Jupiter are usually known by numbers I.,\r\nII., III., and IV.; I. being the nearest to the planet, and IV. the\r\nfarthest. III. is usually the brightest, and IV. the faintest, but\r\nexceptions to this rule have been noticed.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the recently discovered sixth and seventh satellites of\r\nJupiter, Prof. Perrine has suggested that the large inclination of their\r\norbits to the plane of the planet's equator seems to indicate that neither\r\nof these bodies was originally a member of Jupiter's family, but has been\r\n\"captured by the planet.\" This seems possible as the orbits of some of the\r\nminor planets lie near the orbit of Jupiter (see \"Minor Planets\"). A\r\nsimilar suggestion has been made by Prof. del Marmol.[134]\r\n\r\nMany curious observations have been recorded with reference to Jupiter's\r\nsatellites; some very difficult of explanation. In 1711 Bianchini saw\r\nsatellite IV. so faint for more than an hour that it was hardly visible! A\r\nsimilar observation was made by Lassell with a more powerful telescope on\r\nJune 13, 1849. Key, T. T. Smyth, and Denning have also recorded unusual\r\nfaintness.[135] A very remarkable phenomenon was seen by Admiral Smyth,\r\nMaclear, and Pearson on June 26, 1828. Satellite II., \"having fairly\r\nentered on Jupiter, was found 12 or 13 minutes afterwards _outside the\r\nlimb_, where it remained visible for at least 4 minutes, and then suddenly\r\nvanished.\" As Webb says, \"Explanation is here set at defiance;\r\ndemonstrably neither in the atmosphere of the earth, nor Jupiter, where\r\nand what could have been the cause? At present we can get no answer.\"[136]\r\nWhen Jupiter is in opposition to the sun--that is, on the meridian at\r\nmidnight--satellite I. has been seen projected on its own shadow, the\r\nshadow appearing as a dark ring round the satellite.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1848, at Cambridge (U.S.A.) satellite III. was seen in\r\ntransit lying between the shadows of I. and II. and so black that it could\r\nnot be distinguished from the shadows, \"except by the place it occupied.\"\r\nThis seems to suggest inherent light in the planet's surface, as the\r\nsatellite was at the time illuminated by full sunshine; its apparent\r\nblackness being due to the effect of contrast. Cassini on one occasion\r\nfailed to find the shadow of satellite I. when it should have been on the\r\nplanet's disc,[137] an observation which again points to the glowing light\r\nof Jupiter's surface. Sadler and Trouvelot saw the shadow of satellite I.\r\ndouble! an observation difficult to explain--but the same phenomenon was\r\nagain seen on the evening of September 19, 1891, by Mr. H. S. Halbert of\r\nDetroit, Michigan (U.S.A.). He says that the satellite \"was in transit\r\nnearing egress, and it appeared as a white disc against the dark southern\r\nequatorial belt; following it was the usual shadow, and at an equal\r\ndistance from this was a second shadow, smaller and not so dark as the\r\ntrue one, and surrounded by a faint penumbra.\"[138]\r\n\r\nA dark transit of satellite III. was again seen on the evening of December\r\n19, 1891, by two observers in America. One observer noted that the\r\nsatellite, when on the disc of the planet, was intensely black. To the\r\nother observer (Willis L. Barnes) it appeared as an ill-defined _dark_\r\nimage.[139] A similar observation was made on October 9 of the same year\r\nby Messrs. Gale and Innes.[140]\r\n\r\nA \"black transit\" of satellite IV. was seen by several observers in 1873,\r\nand by Prof. Barnard on May 4, 1886. The same phenomenon was observed on\r\nOctober 30, 1903, in America, by Miss Anne S. Young and Willis S. Barnes.\r\nMiss Young says--\r\n\r\n    \"The ingress of the satellite took place at 8{h} 50{m} (E. standard\r\n    time) when it became invisible upon the background of the planet. An\r\n    hour later it was plainly visible as a dark round spot upon the\r\n    planet. It was decidedly darker than the equatorial belt.\"[141]\r\n\r\nThe rather rare phenomenon of an occultation of one of Jupiter's\r\nsatellites by another was observed by Mr. Apple, director of the Daniel\r\nScholl Observatory, Franklin and Marshall College, Lancaster, Pa.\r\n(U.S.A.), on the evening of March 16, 1908. The satellites in question\r\nwere I. and II., and they were so close that they could not be separated\r\nwith the 11·5-inch telescope of the Observatory.[142] One of the present\r\nwriter's first observations with a telescope is dated May 17, 1873, and is\r\nas follows: \"Observed one of Jupiter's satellites occulted (or very nearly\r\nso) by another. Appeared as one with power 133\" (on 3-inch refractor in\r\nthe Punjab). These satellites were probably I. and II.\r\n\r\nJupiter has been seen on several occasions apparently without his\r\nsatellites; some being behind the disc, some eclipsed in his shadow, and\r\nsome in transit across the disc. This phenomenon was seen by Galileo,\r\nMarch 15, 1611; by Molyneux, on November 12, 1681; by Sir William\r\nHerschel, May 23, 1802; by Wallis, April 15, 1826; by Greisbach, September\r\n27, 1843; and by several observers on four occasions in the years\r\n1867-1895.[143] The phenomenon again occurred on October 3, 1907, No. 1\r\nbeing eclipsed and occulted, No. 2 in transit, No. 3 eclipsed, and No. 4\r\nocculted.[144] It was not, however, visible in Europe, but could have been\r\nseen in Asia and Oceania.[144] The phenomenon will occur again on October\r\n22, 1913.[145]\r\n\r\nOn the night of September 19, 1903, a star of magnitude 6-1/2 was occulted\r\nby the disc of Jupiter. This curious and rare phenomenon was photographed\r\nby M. Lucien Rudaux at the Observatory of Donville, France.[146] The star\r\nwas Lalande 45698 (= BAC 8129).[147]\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard, using telescopes with apertures from 5 inches up to 36\r\ninches (Lick), has failed to see a satellite through the planet's limb (an\r\nobservation which has been claimed by other astronomers). He says, \"To my\r\nmind this has been due to either poor seeing, a poor telescope, or an\r\nexcited observer.\"[148] He adds--\r\n\r\n    \"I think it is high time that the astronomers reject the idea that the\r\n    satellites of Jupiter can be seen through his limb at occultation.\r\n    When the seeing is bad there is a spurious limb to Jupiter that well\r\n    might give the appearance of transparency at the occultation of a\r\n    satellite. But under first-class conditions the limb of Jupiter is\r\n    perfectly opaque. It is quibbling and begging the question altogether\r\n    to say the phenomenon of transparency may be a rare one and so have\r\n    escaped my observations. Has any one said that the moon was\r\n    transparent when a star has been seen projected on it when it ought to\r\n    have been behind it?\"\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard and Mr. Douglass have seen white polar caps on the third and\r\nfourth satellites of Jupiter. The former says they are \"exactly like those\r\non Mars.\" \"Both caps of the fourth satellite have been clearly\r\ndistinguished, that at the north being sometimes exceptionally large,\r\ncovering a surface equal to one-quarter or one-third of the diameter of\r\nthe satellite.\"[149] This was confirmed on November 23, 1906, when Signor\r\nJ. Comas Sola observed a brilliant white spot surrounded by a dark marking\r\nin the north polar region of the third satellite. There were other dark\r\nmarkings visible, and the satellite presented the appearance of a\r\nminiature of Mars.[150]\r\n\r\nAn eighth satellite of Jupiter has recently been discovered by Mr. Melotte\r\nat the Greenwich Observatory by means of photography. It moves in a\r\nretrograde direction round Jupiter in an orbit inclined about 30° to that\r\nof the planet. The period of revolution is about two years. The orbit is\r\nvery eccentric, the eccentricity being about one-third, or greater than\r\nthat of any other satellite of the solar system. When nearest to Jupiter\r\nit is about 9 millions of miles from the planet, and when farthest about\r\n20 millions.[151] It has been suggested by Mr. George Forbes that this\r\nsatellite may possibly be identical with the lost comet of Lexell which at\r\nits return in the year 1779 became entangled in Jupiter's system, and has\r\nnot been seen since. If this be the case, we should have the curious\r\nphenomenon of a comet revolving round a planet!\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt the four bright satellites of Jupiter were seen\r\nalmost simultaneously and quite independently by Simon Marius at Ausbach\r\non December 29, 1609, and by Galileo at Padua on January 7, 1610.[152] The\r\nactual priority, therefore, seems to rest with Simon Marius, but the\r\npublication of the discovery was first made by Galileo in his _Nuncius\r\nSiderius_ (1610).[153] Grant, however, in his _History of Physical\r\nAstronomy_, calls Simon Marius an \"impudent pretender\"! (p. 79).\r\n\r\nM. Dupret at Algiers saw Jupiter with the naked eye on September 26, 1890,\r\ntwenty minutes before sunset.[154]\r\n\r\nHumboldt states that he saw Jupiter with the naked eye when the sun was\r\nfrom 18° to 20° above the horizon.[155] This was in the plains of South\r\nAmerica near the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSaturn\r\n\r\n\r\nTo show the advantages of large telescopes over small ones, Mr. C. Roberts\r\nsays that \"with the 25-inch refractor of the Cambridge Observatory the\r\nview of the planet Saturn is indescribably glorious; everything I had ever\r\nseen before was visible at a glance, and an enormous amount of detail that\r\nI had never even glimpsed before, after a few minutes' observation.\"[156]\r\n\r\nChacornac found that the illumination of Saturn's disc is the reverse of\r\nthat of Jupiter, the edges of Saturn being brighter than the centre of the\r\ndisc, while in the case of Jupiter--as in that of the sun--the edges are\r\nfainter than the centre.[157] According to Mr. Denning, Saturn bears\r\nsatisfactorily \"greater magnifying power than either Mars or\r\nJupiter.\"[158]\r\n\r\nAt an occultation of Saturn by the moon, which occurred on June 13, 1900,\r\nM. M. Honorat noticed the great contrast between the slightly yellowish\r\ncolour of the moon and the greenish tint of the planet.[159]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1892, when the rings of Saturn had nearly disappeared, Prof.\r\nL. W. Underwood, of the Underwood Observatory, Appleton, Wisconsin\r\n(U.S.A.), saw one of Saturn's satellites (Titan) apparently moving along\r\nthe needlelike appendage to the planet presented by the rings. \"The\r\napparent diameter of the satellite so far exceeded the apparent thickness\r\nof the ring that it gave the appearance of a beautiful golden bead moving\r\nvery slowly along a fine golden thread.\"[160]\r\n\r\nIn 1907, when the rings of Saturn became invisible in ordinary telescopes,\r\nProfessor Campbell, observing with the great Lick telescope, noticed\r\n\"prominent bright knots, visible ... in Saturn's rings. The knots were\r\nsymmetrically placed, two being to the east and two to the west.\" This was\r\nconfirmed by Mr. Lowell, who says, \"Condensations in Saturn's rings\r\nconfirmed here and measured repeatedly. Symmetric and permanent.\" This\r\nphenomenon was previously seen by Bond in the years 1847-56. Measures of\r\nthese light spots made by Prof. Barnard with the 40-inch Yerkes telescope\r\nshow that the outer one corresponded in position with the outer edge of\r\nthe middle ring close to the Cassini division, and the inner condensation,\r\ncurious to say, seemed to coincide in position with the \"crape ring.\"\r\nProf. Barnard thinks that the thickness of the rings \"must be greatly\r\nunder 100 miles, and probably less than 50 miles,\" and he says--\r\n\r\n    \"The important fact clearly brought out at this apparition of _Saturn_\r\n    is that the bright rings are not opaque to the light of the sun--and\r\n    this is really what we should expect from the nature of their\r\n    constitution as shown by the theory of Clerk Maxwell, and the\r\n    spectroscopic results of Keeler.\"[161]\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions it would be theoretically possible, according to\r\nMr. Whitmell, to see the globe of Saturn through the Cassini division in\r\nthe ring. But the observation would be one of great difficulty and\r\ndelicacy. The effect would be that, of the arc of the division which\r\ncrosses the planet's disc, \"a small portion will appear bright instead of\r\ndark, and may almost disappear.\"[162]\r\n\r\nA remarkable white spot was seen on Saturn on June 23, 1903, by Prof.\r\nBarnard, and afterwards by Mr. Denning.[163] Another white spot was seen\r\nby Denning on July 9 of the same year.[164] From numerous observations of\r\nthese spots, Denning found a rotation period for the planet of about\r\n10{h} 39{m} 21{s}.[165] From observations of the same spots Signor Comas\r\nSola found a period 10{h} 38{m}·4, a close agreement with Denning's\r\nresult. For Saturn's equator, Prof. Hill found a rotation period of 10{h}\r\n14{m} 23{s}·8, so that--as in the case of Jupiter--the rotation is faster\r\nat the equator than in the northern latitudes of the planet. A similar\r\nphenomenon is observed in the sun. Mr. Denning's results were fully\r\nconfirmed by Herr Leo Brenner, and other German astronomers.[166]\r\n\r\nPhotographs taken by Prof. V. M. Slipher in America show that the spectrum\r\nof Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter. None of the bands observed in the\r\nplanet's spectrum are visible in the spectrum of the rings. This shows\r\nthat if the rings possess an atmosphere at all, it must be much rarer than\r\nthat surrounding the ball of the planet. Prof. Slipher says that \"none of\r\nthe absorption bands in the spectrum of _Saturn_ can be identified with\r\nthose bands due to absorption in the earth's atmosphere,\" and there is no\r\ntrace of aqueous vapour.[167]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1907, M. G. Fournier suspected the existence of a \"faint\r\ntransparent and luminous ring\" outside the principal rings of Saturn. He\r\nthinks that it may possibly be subject to periodical fluctuations of\r\nbrightness, sometimes being visible and sometimes not.[168] This dusky\r\nring was again suspected at the Geneva Observatory in October, 1908.[169]\r\nM. Schaer found it a difficult object with a 16-inch Cassegrain reflector.\r\nProf. Stromgen at Copenhagen, and Prof. Hartwig at Bamberg, however,\r\nfailed to see any trace of the supposed ring.[170] It was seen at\r\nGreenwich in October, 1908.\r\n\r\nA \"dark transit\" of Saturn's satellite Titan across the disc of the planet\r\nhas been observed on several occasions. It was seen by Mr. Isaac W. Ward,\r\nof Belfast, on March 27, 1892, with a 4·3-inch Wray refractor. The\r\nsatellite appeared smaller than its shadow. The phenomenon was also seen\r\non March 12 of the same year by the Rev. A. Freeman, Mr. Mee, and M. F.\r\nTerby; and again on November 6, 1907, by Mr. Paul Chauleur and Mr. A. B.\r\nCobham.[171]\r\n\r\nThe recently discovered tenth satellite of Saturn, Themis, was discovered\r\nby photography, and has never been seen by the eye even with the largest\r\ntelescopes! But its existence is beyond all doubt, and its orbit round the\r\nplanet has been calculated.\r\n\r\nProf. Hussey of the Lick Observatory finds that Saturn's satellite Mimas\r\nis probably larger than Hyperion. He also finds from careful measurements\r\nthat the diameter of Titan is certainly overestimated, and that its\r\nprobable diameter is about 2500 miles.[172]\r\n\r\nThe French astronomer, M. Lucien Rudaux, finds the following variation in\r\nthe light of the satellites of Saturn:--\r\n\r\n  Japetus from 9th magnitude to 12th\r\n  Rhea     \"   9       \"        10·6\r\n  Dione    \"   9·5     \"        10·5\r\n  Tethys   \"   9·8     \"        10·5\r\n  Titan    \"   8       \"         8·6\r\n\r\nThe variation of light is, he thinks, due to the fact that the period of\r\nrotation of each satellite is equal to that of their revolution round the\r\nplanet; as in the case of our moon.[173]\r\n\r\nThe names of the satellites of Saturn are derived from the ancient heathen\r\nmythology. They are given in order of distance from the planet, the\r\nnearest being Mimas and the farthest Themis.\r\n\r\n1. Mimas was a Trojan born at the same time as Paris.\r\n\r\n2. Enceladus was son of Tartarus and Ge.\r\n\r\n3. Tethys was wife of Oceanus, god of ocean currents. She became mother of\r\nall the chief rivers in the universe, as also the Oceanides or sea nymphs.\r\n\r\n4. Dione was one of the wives of Zeus.\r\n\r\n5. Rhea was a daughter of Uranus. She married Saturn, and became the\r\nmother of Vesta, Ceres, Juno, and Pluto.\r\n\r\n6. Titan was the eldest son of Uranus.\r\n\r\n7. Hyperion was the god of day, and the father of sun and moon.\r\n\r\n8. Japetus was the fifth son of Uranus, and father of Atlas and\r\nPrometheus.[174]\r\n\r\n9. Phoebe was daughter of Uranus and Ge.\r\n\r\n10. Themis was daughter of Uranus and Ge, and, therefore, sister of\r\nPhoebe.\r\n\r\nIn a review of Prof. Comstock's _Text Book of Astronomy_ in _The\r\nObservatory_, November, 1901, the remark occurs, \"We are astonished to see\r\nthat Mr. Comstock alludes with apparent seriousness to the _nine_\r\nsatellites of Saturn. As regards the ninth satellite, we thought that all\r\nastronomers held with Mrs. Betsy Prig on the subject of this astronomical\r\nMrs. Harris.\" This reads curiously now (1909) when the existence of the\r\nninth satellite (Phoebe) has been fully confirmed, and a tenth satellite\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nUranus and Neptune\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom observations of Uranus made in 1896, M. Leo Brenner concluded that\r\nthe planet rotates on its axis in about 8-1/2 hours (probably 8{h} 27{m}).\r\nThis is a short period, but considering the short periods of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn there seems to be nothing improbable about it.\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard finds that the two inner satellites of Uranus are difficult\r\nobjects even with the great 36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory!\r\nThey have, however, been photographed at Cambridge (U.S.A.) with a 13-inch\r\nlens, although they are \"among the most difficult objects known.\"[175]\r\n\r\nSir William Huggins in 1871 found strong absorption lines (six strong\r\nlines) in the spectrum of Uranus. One of these lines indicated the\r\npresence of hydrogen, a gas which does not exist in our atmosphere. Three\r\nof the other lines seen were situated near lines in the spectrum of\r\natmospheric air. Neither carbonic acid nor sodium showed any indications\r\nof their presence in the planet's spectrum. A photograph by Prof. Slipher\r\nof Neptune's spectrum \"shows the spectrum of this planet to contain many\r\nstrong absorption bands. These bands are so pronounced in the part of the\r\nspectrum between the Fraunhofer lines F and D, as to leave the solar\r\nspectrum unrecognizable.... Neptune's spectrum is strikingly different\r\nfrom that of _Uranus_, the bands in the latter planet all being reinforced\r\nin _Neptune_. In this planet there are also new bands which have not been\r\nobserved in any of the other planets. The F line of hydrogen is remarkably\r\ndark ... this band is of more than solar strength in the spectrum of\r\nUranus also. Thus free hydrogen seems to be present in the atmosphere of\r\nboth these planets. This and the other dark bands in these planets bear\r\nevidence of an enveloping atmosphere of gases which is quite unlike that\r\nwhich surrounds the earth.\"[176]\r\n\r\nWith the 18-inch equatorial telescope of the Strasburgh Observatory, M.\r\nWirtz measured the diameter of Neptune, and found from forty-nine measures\r\nmade between December 9, 1902, and March 28, 1903, a value of 2\"·303 at a\r\ndistance of 30·1093 (earth's distance from sun = 1). This gives a diameter\r\nof 50,251 kilometres, or about 31,225 miles,[177] and a mean density of\r\n1·54 (water = 1; earth's mean density = 5·53). Prof. Barnard's measures\r\ngave a diameter of 32,900 miles, a fairly close agreement, considering the\r\ndifficulty of measuring so small a disc as that shown by Neptune.\r\n\r\nThe satellite of Neptune was photographed at the Pulkown Observatory in\r\nthe year 1899. The name Triton has been suggested for it. In the old Greek\r\nmythology Triton was a son of Neptune, so the name would be an appropriate\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a second satellite of Neptune is suspected by Prof.\r\nSchaeberle, who thinks he once saw it with the 36-inch telescope of the\r\nLick Observatory \"on an exceptionally fine night\" in 1895.[178] But this\r\nsupposed discovery has not yet been confirmed. Lassell also thought he had\r\ndiscovered a second satellite, but this supposed discovery was never\r\nconfirmed.[178]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Burmese mention eight planets, the sun, the moon, Mercury,\r\nVenus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and another named Râhu, which is invisible.\r\nIt has been surmised that \"Râhu\" is Uranus, which is just visible to the\r\nnaked eye, and may possibly have been discovered by keen eyesight in\r\nancient times. The present writer has seen it several times without\r\noptical aid in the West of Ireland, and with a binocular field-glass of 2\r\ninches aperture he found it quite a conspicuous object.\r\n\r\nWhen Neptune was _visually_ discovered by Galle, at Berlin, he was\r\nassisted in his observation by Prof. d'Arrest. The incident is thus\r\ndescribed by Dr. Dreyer, \"On the night of June 14, 1874, while observing\r\nCoggia's comet together, I reminded Prof. d'Arrest how he had once said in\r\nthe course of a lecture, that he had been present at the finding of\r\nNeptune, and that 'he might say it would not have been found without him.'\r\nHe then told me (and I wrote it down the next day), how he had suggested\r\nthe use of Bremiker's map (as first mentioned by Dr. Galle in 1877) and\r\ncontinued, 'We then went back to the dome, where there was a kind of desk,\r\nat which I placed myself with the map, while Galle, looking through the\r\nrefractor, described the configurations of the stars he saw. I followed\r\nthem on the map one by one, until he said: \"And then there is a star of\r\nthe 8th magnitude, in such and such a position,\" whereupon I immediately\r\nexclaimed: \"That star is not on the map.\"'\"[179] This was the planet. But\r\nit seems to the present writer that if Galle or d'Arrest had access to\r\nHarding's Atlas (as they probably had) they might easily have found the\r\nplanet with a good binocular field-glass. As a matter of fact Neptune is\r\nshown in Harding's Atlas (1822) as a star of the 8th magnitude, having\r\nbeen mistaken for a star by Lalande on May 8 and 10, 1795; and the present\r\nwriter has found Harding's 8th magnitude stars quite easy objects with a\r\nbinocular field-glass having object-glasses of two inches diameter, and a\r\npower of about six diameters.\r\n\r\nSUPPOSED PLANET BEYOND NEPTUNE.--The possible existence of a planet beyond\r\nNeptune has been frequently suggested. From considerations on the aphelia\r\nof certain comets, Prof. Forbes in 1880 computed the probable position of\r\nsuch a body. He thought this hypothetical planet would be considerably\r\nlarger than Jupiter, and probably revolve round the sun at a distance of\r\nabout 100 times the earth's mean distance from the sun. The place\r\nindicated was between R.A. 11{h} 24{m} and 12{h} 12{m}, and declination 0°\r\n0' to 6° 0' north. With a view to its discovery, the late Dr. Roberts took\r\na series of eighteen photographs covering the region indicated. The result\r\nof an examination of these photographs showed, Dr. Roberts says, that \"no\r\nplanet of greater brightness than a star of the 15th magnitude exists on\r\nthe sky area herein indicated.\" Prof. W. H. Pickering has recently revived\r\nthe question, and has arrived at the following results: Mean distance of\r\nthe planet from the sun, 51·9 (earth's mean distance = 1); period of\r\nrevolution, 373-1/2 years; mass about twice the earth's mass; probable\r\nposition for 1909 about R.A. 7{h} 47{m}, north declination 21°, or about\r\n5° south-east of the star [Greek: k] Geminorum. The supposed planet would\r\nbe faint, its brightness being from 11-1/2 to 13-1/2, according to the\r\n\"albedo\" (or reflecting power) it may have.[180]\r\n\r\nProf. Forbes has again attacked the question of a possible ultra-Neptunian\r\nplanet, and from a consideration of the comets of 1556, 1843 I, 1880 I,\r\nand 1882 II, finds a mean distance of 105·4, with an inclination of the\r\norbit of 52° to the plane of the ecliptic. This high inclination implies\r\nthat \"during the greatest part of its revolution it is beyond the zodiac,\"\r\nand this, Mr. W. T. Lynn thinks, \"may partly account for its not having\r\nhitherto been found by observation.\"[181]\r\n\r\nFrom a consideration of the approximately circular shape of the orbits of\r\nall the large planets of the solar system, Dr. See suggests the existence\r\nof three planets outside Neptune, with approximate distances from the sun\r\nof 42, 56, and 72 respectively (earth's distance = 1), and recommends a\r\nphotographic search for them. He says, \"To suppose the planetary system to\r\nterminate with an orbit so round as that of Neptune is as absurd as to\r\nsuppose that Jupiter's system terminates with the orbit of the fourth\r\nsatellite.\"[182]\r\n\r\nAccording to Grant, even twenty years before the discovery of Neptune the\r\nerror of Prof. Adams' first approximation amounted to little more than\r\n10°.[183]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nComets\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learn from Pliny that comets were classified in ancient times,\r\naccording to their peculiar forms, into twelve classes, of which the\r\nprincipal were: _Pogonias_, bearded; _Lampadias_, torch-like; _Xiphias_,\r\nsword-like; _Pitheus_, tun-like; _Acontias_, javelin-like; _Ceratias_,\r\nhorn-like; _Disceus_, quoit-like; and _Hippias_, horse-mane-like.[184]\r\n\r\nOf the numerous comets mentioned in astronomical records, comparatively\r\nfew have been visible to the naked eye. Before the invention of the\r\ntelescope (1610) only those which were so visible _could_, of course, be\r\nrecorded. These number about 400. Of the 400 observed since then, some 70\r\nor 80 only have been visible by unaided vision; and most of these now\r\nrecorded could never have been seen without a telescope. During the last\r\ncentury, out of 300 comets discovered, only 13 were very visible to the\r\nnaked eye. Hence, when we read in the newspapers that a comet has been\r\ndiscovered the chances are greatly against it becoming visible to the\r\nnaked eye.[185]\r\n\r\nAlthough comparatively few comets can be seen without a telescope, they\r\nare sometimes bright enough to be visible in daylight! Such were those of\r\nB.C. 43, A.D. 1106, 1402, 1532, 1577, 1744, 1843, and the \"great September\r\ncomet\" of 1882.\r\n\r\nIf we except the great comet of 1861, through the tail of which the earth\r\nis supposed to have passed, the comet which came nearest to the earth was\r\nthat of 1770, known as Lexell's, which approached us within two millions\r\nof miles, moving nearly in the plane of the ecliptic. It produced,\r\nhowever, no effect on the tides, nor on the moon's motion, which shows\r\nthat its mass must have been very small. It was computed by Laplace that\r\nif its mass had equalled that of the earth, the length of our year would\r\nhave been shortened by 2 hours 47 minutes, and as there was no perceptible\r\nchange Laplace concluded that the comet's mass did not exceed 1/5000th of\r\nthe earth's mass. This is the comet which passed so near to Jupiter that\r\nits period was reduced to 5-1/2 years. Owing to another near approach in\r\n1779 it became invisible from the earth, and is now lost.[186] Its\r\nidentity with the recently discovered eighth satellite of Jupiter has been\r\nsuggested by Mr. George Forbes (see under \"Jupiter\"). At the near approach\r\nof Lexell's comet to the earth in 1770, Messier, \"the comet ferret,\"\r\nfound that its head had an apparent diameter of 2-1/2°, or nearly five\r\ntimes that of the moon!\r\n\r\nAnother case of near approach to the earth was that of Biela's comet at\r\nits appearance in 1805. On the evening of December 9 of that year, the\r\ncomet approached the earth within 3,380,000 miles.[187]\r\n\r\nThe comet of A.D. 1106 is stated to have been seen in daylight close to\r\nthe sun. This was on February 4 of that year. On February 10 it had a tail\r\nof 60° in length, according to Gaubil.[188]\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1577 seems to have been one of the brightest on record.\r\nAccording to Tycho Brahé, it was visible in broad daylight. He describes\r\nthe head as \"round, bright, and of a yellowish light,\" with a curved tail\r\nof a reddish colour.[189]\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1652 was observed for about three weeks only, and Hevelius\r\nand Comiers state that it was equal to the moon in apparent size! This\r\nwould indicate a near approach to the earth. An orbit computed by Halley\r\nshows that the least distance was about 12 millions of miles, and the\r\ndiameter of the comet's head rather less than 110,000 miles, or about 14\r\ntimes the earth's diameter.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Denning, \"most of the periodical comets at perihelion are\r\noutside the earth's orbit, and hence it follows that they escape\r\nobservation unless the earth is on the same side of the sun as the\r\ncomet.\"[190]\r\n\r\nIt was computed by M. Faye that the _volume_ of the famous Donati's comet\r\n(1858) was about 500 times that of the sun! On the other hand, he\r\ncalculated that its _mass_ (or quantity of matter it contained) was only a\r\nfraction of the earth's mass. This shows how almost inconceivably tenuous\r\nthe material forming the comet must have been--much more rarefied, indeed,\r\nthan the most perfect vacuum which can be produced in an air-pump. This\r\ntenuity is shown by the fact that stars were seen through the tail \"as if\r\nthe tail did not exist.\" A mist of a few hundred yards in thickness is\r\nsufficient to hide the stars from our view, while a thickness of thousands\r\nof miles of cometary matter does not suffice even to dim their brilliancy!\r\n\r\nAt the time of the appearance of the great comet of 1843, it was doubtful\r\nwhether the comet had transited the sun's disc. But it is now known, from\r\ncareful calculations by Prof. Hubbard, that a transit really took place\r\nbetween 11{h} 28{m} and 12{h} 29{m} on February 27, 1843, and might have\r\nbeen observed in the southern hemisphere. The distance of this remarkable\r\ncomet from the sun at its perihelion passage was less than that of any\r\nknown comet. A little before 10 p.m. on February 27, the comet passed\r\nwithin 81,500 miles of the sun's surface with the enormous velocity of\r\n348 miles a second! It remained less than 2-1/4 hours north of the\r\necliptic, passing from the ascending to the descending node of its orbit\r\nin 2{h} 13{m}·4.[191] The great comet of 1882 transited the sun's disc on\r\nSunday, September 17, of that year, the ingress taking place at 4{h} 50{m}\r\n58{s}, Cape mean time. When on the sun the comet was absolutely invisible,\r\nshowing that there was nothing solid about it. It was visible near the sun\r\nwith the naked eye a little before the transit took place.[192] This great\r\ncomet was found by several computors to have been travelling in an\r\nelliptic orbit with a period of about eight centuries. Morrison found 712\r\nyears; Frisby, 794; Fabritius, 823; and Kreutz, 843 years.[193]\r\n\r\nThe great southern comet of 1887 may be described as a comet without a\r\nhead! The popular idea of a comet is a star with a tail. But in this case\r\nthere was no head visible--to the naked eye at least. Dr. Thome of the\r\nCordoba Observatory--its discoverer--describes it as \"a beautiful\r\nobject--a narrow, straight, sharply defined, graceful tail, over 40° long,\r\nshining with a soft starry light against a dark sky, beginning apparently\r\nwithout a head, and gradually widening and fading as it extended\r\nupwards.\"[194]\r\n\r\nThe great southern comet of 1901 had five tails on May 6 of that year. Two\r\nwere fairly bright, and the remaining three rather faint. Mr. Gale saw a\r\nnumber of faint stars through the tails. The light of these seem to have\r\nbeen \"undimmed.\" Mr. Cobham noticed that the stars Rigel and [Greek: b]\r\nEridani shone through one of the faint tails, and \"showed no perceptible\r\ndifference.\"[195]\r\n\r\nProf. W. H. Pickering says that \"the head of a comet, as far as our\r\npresent knowledge is concerned, seems therefore to be merely a meteor\r\nswarm containing so much gaseous material that when electrified by its\r\napproach to the sun it will be rendered luminous\" (_Harvard Annual_, vol.\r\nxxxii. part ii. p. 295) \"... if the meteors and their atmospheres are\r\nsufficiently widely separated from one another, the comet may be brilliant\r\nand yet transparent at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nIn the case of Swift's comet of 1892 some periodical differences of\r\nappearance were due, according to Prof. W. H. Pickering, to a rotation of\r\nthe comet round an axis passing longitudinally through the tail, and he\r\nestimated the period of rotation at about 94 to 97 hours. He computed that\r\nin this comet the repulsive force exerted by the sun on the comet's tail\r\nwas \"about 39·5 times the gravitational force.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThe comet known as 1902_b_ approached the planet Mercury within two\r\nmillions of miles on November 29 of that year. Prof. O. C. Wendell, of\r\nHarvard Observatory, made some observations on the transparency of this\r\ncomet. He found with the aid of a photometer and the 15-inch telescope of\r\nthe observatory that in the case of two faint stars over which the comet\r\npassed on October 14, 1902, the absorption of light by the comet was\r\ninsensible, and possibly did not exceed one or two hundredths of a\r\nmagnitude,[197] an amount quite imperceptible to the naked eye, and shows\r\nconclusively how almost inconceivably rarefied the substance of this comet\r\nmust be.\r\n\r\nThe comet known as Morehouse (1908_c_) showed some curious and wonderful\r\nchanges. Mr. Borelly found that five tails are visible on a photographic\r\nplate taken on October 3, 1908, and the trail of an occulted star\r\nindicates a slight absorption effect. According to M. L. Rabourdin, great\r\nchanges took place from day to day, and even during the course of an hour!\r\nSimilar changes were recorded by G. M. Gauthier; and Prof. Barnard, who\r\nphotographed the comet on 30 nights from September 2 to October 13, states\r\nthat the photographs of September 30 \"are unique, whilst the\r\ntransformation which took place between the taking of these and the taking\r\nof the next one on October 1 was very wonderful.\"[198] The spectrum\r\nshowed the lines of cyanogen instead of the hydrocarbon spectrum shown by\r\nmost comets.\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard has suggested that all the phenomena of comets' tails cannot\r\nbe explained by a repulsive force from the sun. Short tails issuing from\r\nthe comet's nucleus at considerable angles with the main tail point to\r\neruptive action in the comet itself. The rapid changes and distortions\r\nfrequently observed in the tails of some comets suggest motion through a\r\nresisting medium; and the sudden increase of light also occasionally\r\nobserved points in the same direction.[199]\r\n\r\nIt was computed by Olbers that if a comet having a mass of 1/2000th of the\r\nearth's mass--which would form a globe of about 520 miles in diameter and\r\nof the density of granite--collided with the earth, with a velocity of 40\r\nmiles a second, our globe would be shattered into fragments.[200] But that\r\nany comet has a solid nucleus of this size seems very doubtful; and we may\r\nfurther say that the collision of the earth with _any_ comet is highly\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a common idea that harvests are affected by comets, and\r\neven \"comet wines\" are sometimes spoken of. But we know that the earth\r\nreceives practically no heat from the brightest comet. Even in the case of\r\nthe brilliant comet of 1811, one of the finest on record, it was found\r\nthat \"all the efforts to concentrate its rays did not produce the\r\nslightest effect on the blackened bulb of the most sensitive thermometer.\"\r\nArago found that the year 1808, in which several comets were visible, was\r\na cold year, \"and 1831, in which there was no comet, enjoyed a much higher\r\ntemperature than 1819, when there were three comets, one of which was very\r\nbrilliant.\"[201] We may, therefore, safely conclude that even a large\r\ncomet has no effect whatever on the weather.\r\n\r\nFrom calculations on the orbit of Halley's comet, the next return of which\r\nis due in 1910, Messrs. Cowell and Crommelin find that the identity of the\r\ncomet shown on the Bayeux Tapestry with Halley's comet is now \"fully\r\nestablished.\" They find that the date of perihelion passage was March 25,\r\n1066, which differs by only 4 days from the date found by Hind. The\r\nimposing aspect of the comet in 1066 described in European chronicles of\r\nthat time is confirmed by the Chinese Annals. In the latter records the\r\nbrightness is compared to that of Venus, and even with that of the moon!\r\nThe comparison with the moon was probably an exaggeration, but the comet\r\ndoubtless made a very brilliant show. In the Bayeux Tapestry the\r\ninscription on the wall behind the spectators reads: \"_isti mirant\r\nstella_.\" Now, this is bad Latin, and Mr. W. T. Lynn has made the\r\ninteresting suggestion that some of the letters are hidden by the\r\nbuildings in front and that the real sentence is \"_isti mirantur\r\nstellam_.\"[202] The present writer has examined the copy of the Bayeux\r\nTapestry which is in the Dublin Museum, and thinks that Mr. Lynn's\r\nsuggestion seems very plausible. But the last letter of _stellam_ is\r\napparently hidden by the comet's tail, which does not seem very probable!\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the comet will appear in 1910 are not unlike\r\nthose of 1066 and 1145. \"In each year the comet was discovered as a\r\nmorning star, then lost in the sun's rays; on its emergence it was near\r\nthe earth and moved with great rapidity, finally becoming stationary in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Hydra, where it was lost to view.\"[203] In 1910 it\r\nwill probably be an evening star before March 17, and after May 11, making\r\na near approach to the earth about May 12. About this time its apparent\r\nmotion in the sky will be very rapid. As, however, periodical comets--such\r\nas Halley's--seem to become fainter at each return, great expectations\r\nwith reference to its appearance in 1910 should not be indulged in.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Halley's comet in A.D. 1222 is thus described by\r\nPingré--a great authority on comets--(quoting from an ancient writer)--\r\n\r\n    \"In autumn, that is to say in the months of August and September, a\r\n    star of the first magnitude was seen, very red, and accompanied by a\r\n    great tail which extended towards the top of the sky in the form of a\r\n    cone extremely pointed. It appeared to be very near the earth. It was\r\n    observed (at first?) near the place of the setting sun in the month of\r\n    December.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to its appearance in the year 1456, when it was of \"vivid\r\nbrightness,\" and had a tail of 60° in length, Admiral Smyth says,[204] \"To\r\nits malign influence were imputed the rapid successes of Mahomet II.,\r\nwhich then threatened all Christendom. The general alarm was greatly\r\naggravated by the conduct of Pope Callixtus III., who, though otherwise a\r\nman of abilities, was a poor astronomer; for that pontiff daily ordered\r\nthe church bells to be rung at noon-tide, extra _Ave-Marias_ to be\r\nrepeated, and a special protest and excommunication was composed,\r\nexorcising equally the Devil, the Turks, and the comet.\" With reference to\r\nthis story, Mr. G. F. Chambers points out[205] that it is probably based\r\non a passage in Platina's _Vitæ Pontificum_. But in this passage there is\r\nno mention made of excommunication or exorcism, so that the story, which\r\nhas long been current, is probably mythical. In confirmation of this view,\r\nthe Rev. W. F. Rigge has shown conclusively[206] that no bull was ever\r\nissued by Pope Callixtus III. containing a reference to _any_ comet. The\r\nstory would therefore seem to be absolutely without foundation, and should\r\nbe consigned to the limbo of all such baseless myths.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the appearance of Halley's comet, at his last return in\r\n1835, Sir John Herschel, who observed it at the Cape of Good Hope, says--\r\n\r\n    \"Among the innumerable stars of all magnitudes, from the ninth\r\n    downwards, which at various times were seen through it, and some\r\n    extremely near to the nucleus (though not _exactly on it_) there never\r\n    appeared the least ground for presuming any extinction of their light\r\n    in traversing it. Very minute stars indeed, on entering its brightest\r\n    portions, were obliterated, as they would have been by an equal\r\n    illumination of the field of view; but stars which before their entry\r\n    appeared bright enough to bear that degree of illumination, were in no\r\n    case, so far as I could judge, affected to a greater extent than they\r\n    would have been by so much lamp-light artificially introduced.\"[207]\r\n\r\nIt is computed by Prof. J. Holetschak that, early in October, 1909,\r\nHalley's comet should have the brightness of a star of about 14-1/2\r\nmagnitude.[208] It should then--if not detected before--be discoverable\r\nwith some of the large telescopes now available.\r\n\r\nAccording to the computations of Messrs. Cowell and Crommelin, the comet\r\nshould enter Pisces from Aries in January, 1910. \"Travelling westward\r\ntowards the star [Greek: g] Piscium until the beginning of May, and then\r\nturning eastward again, it will travel back through the constellations\r\nCetus, Orion, Monoceros, Hydra, and Sextans.\" From this it seems that\r\nobservers in the southern hemisphere will have a better view of the comet\r\nthan those in northern latitudes. The computed brightness varies from 1 on\r\nJanuary 2, 1910, to 1112 on May 10. But the actual brightness of a comet\r\ndoes not always agree with theory. It is sometimes brighter than\r\ncalculation would indicate.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. O. C. Wendell, Halley's comet will, on May 12, 1910,\r\napproach the earth's orbit within 4·6 millions of miles; and he thinks\r\nthat possibly the earth may \"encounter some meteors,\" which are presumably\r\nconnected with the comet. He has computed the \"radiant point\" of these\r\nmeteors (that is, the point from which they appear to come), and finds its\r\nposition to be R.A. 22{h} 42{m}·9, Decl. N. 1° 18'. This point lies a\r\nlittle south-west of the star [Greek: b] Piscium.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Smart, the comet will, on June 2, \"cross the Equator\r\nthirteen degrees south of Regulus, and will then move slowly in the\r\ndirection of [Greek: ph] Leonis. The comet will be at its descending node\r\non the ecliptic in the morning of May 16, and the earth will pass through\r\nthe node on the comet's orbit about two and a half days later. The\r\ncomet's orbit at the node is about 13 million miles within that of the\r\nearth. Matter repelled from the comet's nucleus by the sun with a velocity\r\nof about 216,000 miles per hour, would just meet the earth when crossing\r\nthe comet's orbit plane. Matter expelled with a velocity of 80,000 miles\r\nper hour, as in the case of Comet Morehouse, would require seven days for\r\nthe journey. Cometary matter is said to have acquired greater velocities\r\nthan this, for (according to Webb, who quotes Chacornac) Comet II., 1862,\r\nshot luminous matter towards the sun, with a velocity of nearly 2200 miles\r\nper second. It is therefore possible that matter thrown off by the comet\r\nat the node may enter our atmosphere, in which case we must hope that\r\ncyanogen, which so often appears in cometary spectra, may not be\r\ninconveniently in evidence.\"[209]\r\n\r\nCyanogen is, of course, a poisonous gas, but cometary matter is so\r\nrarefied that injurious effects on the earth need not be feared.\r\n\r\nIf we can believe the accounts which have been handed down to us, some\r\nvery wonderful comets were visible in ancient times. The following may be\r\nmentioned:--\r\n\r\nB.C. 165. The sun is said to have been \"seen for several hours in the\r\nnight.\" If this was a comet it must have been one of extraordinary\r\nbrilliancy.[210]\r\n\r\nB.C. 146. \"After the death of Demetrius, king of Syria, the father of\r\nDemetrius and Antiochus, a little before the war in Achaia, there appeared\r\na comet as large as the sun. Its disc was first red, and like fire,\r\nspreading sufficient light to dissipate the darkness of night; after a\r\nlittle while its size diminished, its brilliancy became weakened, and at\r\nlength it entirely disappeared.\"[211]\r\n\r\nB.C. 134. It is recorded that at the birth of Mithridates a great comet\r\nappeared which \"occupied the fourth part of the sky, and its brilliancy\r\nwas superior to that of the sun.\" (?)[212]\r\n\r\nB.C. 75. A comet is described as equal in size to the moon, and giving as\r\nmuch light as the sun on a cloudy day. (!)[213]\r\n\r\nA.D. 531. In this year a great comet was observed in Europe and China. It\r\nis described as \"a very large and fearful comet,\" and was visible in the\r\nwest for three weeks. Hind thinks that this was an appearance of Halley's\r\ncomet,[214] and this has been confirmed by Mr. Crommelin.\r\n\r\nA.D. 813, August 4. A comet is said to have appeared on this date, of\r\nwhich the following curious description is given: \"It resembled two moons\r\njoined together; they separated, and having taken different forms, at\r\nlength appeared like a man without a head.\" (!)[215]\r\n\r\nA.D. 893. A great comet is said to have appeared in this year with a tail\r\n100° in length, which afterwards increased to 200°![216]\r\n\r\nA.D. 1402. A comet appeared in February of this year, which was visible in\r\ndaylight for eight days. \"On Palm Sunday, March 19, its size was\r\nprodigious.\" Another comet, visible in the daytime, was seen from June to\r\nSeptember of the same year.\r\n\r\nWhen the orbit of the comet known as 1889 V was computed, it was found\r\nthat it had passed through Jupiter's system in 1886 (July 18-21). The\r\ncalculations show that it must have passed within a distance of 112,300\r\nmiles of the planet itself--or less than half the moon's distance from the\r\nearth--and \"its centre may possibly have grazed the surface of\r\nJupiter.\"[217]\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel thought that the great comet of 1861 was by far the\r\nbrightest comet he had ever seen, those of 1811 and 1858 (Donati's) not\r\nexcepted.[218] Prof. Kreutz found its period of revolution round the sun\r\nto be about 409 years, with the plane of the orbit nearly at right angles\r\nto the plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 1795, Sir William Herschel saw the comet of that year pass\r\ncentrally over a small double star of the 11th and 12th magnitudes, and\r\nthe fainter of the two components remained distinctly visible during the\r\ncomet's transit over the star. This comet was an appearance of the comet\r\nnow known as Encke's.[219] Struve saw a star of the 10th magnitude through\r\nnearly the brightest part of Encke's comet on November 7, 1828, but the\r\nstar's light was not dimmed by the comet.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel saw a cluster of stars of the 16th or 17th magnitude\r\nthrough Biela's comet, although the interposed cometary matter must have\r\nbeen at least 50,000 miles in thickness.[220]\r\n\r\nBessel found that on September 29, 1835, a star of the 10th magnitude\r\nshone with undimmed lustre through the tail of Halley's comet within 8\r\nseconds of arc of the central point of the head. At Dorpat (Russia) Struve\r\nsaw the same star \"in conjunction only 2\"·2 from the brightest point of\r\nthe comet. The star remained continuously visible, and its light was not\r\nperceptibly diminished whilst the nucleus of the comet seemed to be almost\r\nextinguished before the radiance of the small star of the 9th or 10th\r\nmagnitude.\"[221]\r\n\r\nWebb says--\r\n\r\n    \"Donati saw a 7 mg. star enlarged so as to show a sensible disc, when\r\n    the nucleus of comet III., 1860, passed very near it. Stars are said\r\n    to have started, or become tremulous, during occultations by comets.\r\n    Birmingham observed the comet of Encke illuminated by a star over\r\n    which it passed, August 23, 1868; and Klein, in 1861, remarked an\r\n    exceptional twinkling in 5 mg. stars involved in the tail.\"[222]\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1729 had the greatest perihelion distance of any known\r\ncomet;[223] that is, when nearest to the sun, it did not approach the\r\ncentral luminary within four times the earth's distance from the sun!\r\n\r\nBarnard's comet, 1889 I., although it never became visible to the naked\r\neye, was visible with a telescope from September 2, 1888, to August 18,\r\n1890, or 715 days--the longest period of visibility of any comet on\r\nrecord. When last seen it was 6-1/4 times the earth's distance from the\r\nsun, or about 580 millions of miles,[224] or beyond the orbit of Jupiter!\r\n\r\nMessier, who was called \"the comet ferret,\" discovered \"all his comets\r\nwith a small 2-foot telescope of 2-1/4 inches aperture, magnifying 5\r\ntimes, and with a field of 4°.\"[225]\r\n\r\nIt is a very curious fact that Sir William Herschel, \"during all his\r\nstar-gaugings and sweeps for nebulæ, never discovered a comet;\"[226] that\r\nis an object which was afterwards _proved_ to be a comet. Possibly,\r\nhowever, some of his nebulæ which are now missing, may have been really\r\ncomets.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel found the diameter of the head of the great comet of\r\n1811 to be 127,000 miles. The surrounding envelope he estimated to be at\r\nleast 643,000 miles, or about three-fourths of the sun's diameter.\r\n\r\nOn a drawing of the tails of the great comet of 1744 given in a little\r\nbook printed in Berlin in that year, no less than 12 tails are shown!\r\nThese vary in length and brightness. A copy of this drawing is given in\r\n_Copernicus_.[227] The observations were made by \"einen geschichten\r\nFrauenzimmer,\" who Dr. Dreyer identifies with Christian Kirch, or one of\r\nher two sisters, daughters of the famous Gottfried and Maria Margaretta\r\nKirch (_Idem_, p. 107). Dr. Dreyer thinks that the drawing \"seems to have\r\nbeen carefully made, and not to be a mere rough sketch as I had at first\r\nsupposed\" (_Idem_, p. 185).\r\n\r\nThe tails of some comets were of immense length. That of the comet of 1769\r\nhad an absolute length of 38 millions of miles. That of 1680, 96 million\r\nof miles, or more than the sun's distance from the earth. According to Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel, the tail of the great comet of 1811 was over 100\r\nmillions of miles in length. That of the great comet of 1843--one of the\r\nfinest in history--is supposed to have reached a length of 150 millions of\r\nmiles![228]\r\n\r\nIn width the tails of comets were in some cases enormous. According to Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel, the tail of the comet of 1811 had a diameter of 15\r\nmillions of miles! Its volume was, therefore, far greater than that of the\r\nsun![228]\r\n\r\nAccording to Hevelius the comet of 1652 was of such a magnitude that it\r\n\"resembled the moon when half full; only it shone with a pale and dismal\r\nlight.\"[229]\r\n\r\nHalley's comet at its next appearance will be examined with the\r\nspectroscope for the first time in its history. At its last return in\r\n1835, the spectroscope had not been invented.\r\n\r\nFor the great comet of 1811, Arago computed a period of 3065 years; and\r\nEncke found a period of 8800 years for the great comet of 1680.[230]\r\n\r\nThe variation in the orbital velocity of some comets is enormous. The\r\nvelocity of the comet of 1680 when passing round the sun (perihelion) was\r\nabout 212 miles a second! Whereas at its greatest distance from the sun\r\n(aphelion) the velocity is reduced to about 10 feet a second!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nMeteors\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Denning thinks that the meteor shower of the month of May, known as\r\nthe Aquarids, is probably connected with Halley's comet. The meteors\r\nshould be looked for after 1 a.m. during the first week in May, and may\r\npossibly show an enhanced display in May, 1910, when Halley's comet will\r\nbe near the sun and earth.[231]\r\n\r\nOn November 29, 1905, Sir David Gill observed a fireball with an apparent\r\ndiameter equal to that of the moon, which remained visible for 5 minutes\r\nand disappeared in a hazy sky. Observed from another place, Mr. Fuller\r\nfound that the meteor was visible 2 hours later! Sir David Gill stated\r\nthat he does not know of any similar phenomenon.[232]\r\n\r\nMr. Denning finds that swiftly moving meteors become visible at a greater\r\nheight above the earth's surface than the slower ones. Thus, for the\r\nLeonids and Perseids, which are both swift, it has been found that the\r\nLeonids appear at an average height of 84 miles, and disappear at a height\r\nof 56 miles; and the Perseids at 80 and 54 miles respectively. \"On the\r\nother hand, the mean height of the very slow meteors average about 65\r\nmiles at the beginning and 38 miles at the end of their appearance.\"[233]\r\n\r\nDuring the night of July 21-22, 1896, Mr. William Brooks, the well-known\r\nastronomer, and director of the Smith Observatory at Geneva (New York),\r\nsaw a round dark body pass slowly across the moon's bright disc, the moon\r\nbeing nearly full at the time. The apparent diameter of the object was\r\nabout one minute of arc, and the duration of the transit 3 or 4 seconds,\r\nthe direction of motion being from east to west. On August 22 of the same\r\nyear, Mr. Gathman (an American observer) saw a meteor crossing the _sun's_\r\ndisc, the transit lasting about 8 seconds.[234]\r\n\r\nA meteor which appeared in Italy on July 7, 1892, was shown by Prof. von\r\nNiessl to have had an _ascending_ path towards the latter end of its\r\ncourse! The length of its path was computed to be 683 miles. When first\r\nseen, its height above the earth was about 42 miles, and when it\r\ndisappeared its height had increased to about 98 miles, showing that its\r\nmotion was directed upwards![235]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the fall of meteoric stones, which occasionally occur, it\r\nhas sometimes been noticed that the sound caused by the explosion of the\r\nmeteorite, or its passage through the air, is heard before the meteorite\r\nis seen to fall. This has been explained by the fact that owing to the\r\nresistance of the air to a body moving at first with a high velocity its\r\nspeed is so reduced that it strikes the earth with a velocity less than\r\nthat of sound. Hence the sound reaches the earth before the body strikes\r\nthe ground.[236]\r\n\r\nThe largest meteoric stone preserved in a museum is that known as the\r\nAnighita, which weighs 36-1/2 tons, and was found at Cape York in\r\nGreenland. It was brought to the American Museum of Natural History by\r\nCommander R. E. Peary, the Arctic explorer.\r\n\r\nThe second largest known is that of Bacubirito in Mexico, the weight of\r\nwhich is estimated at 27-1/2 tons.\r\n\r\nThe third largest is that known as the Williamette, which was found in\r\n1902 near the town of that name in Western Oregon (U.S.A.). It is composed\r\nof metallic nickel-iron, and weighs about 13-1/2 tons. It is now in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nA large meteorite was actually seen, from the deck of the steamer _African\r\nPrince_, to fall into the Atlantic Ocean, on October 7, 1906! The captain\r\nof the vessel, Captain Anderson, describes it as having a train of light\r\nresembling \"an immense broad electric-coloured band, gradually turning to\r\norange, and then to the colour of molten metal. When the meteor came into\r\nthe denser atmosphere close to the earth, it appeared, as nearly as is\r\npossible to describe it, like a molten mass of metal being poured out. It\r\nentered the water with a hissing noise close to the ship.\"[237] This was a\r\nvery curious and perhaps unique phenomenon, and it would seem that the\r\nvessel had a narrow escape from destruction.\r\n\r\nIn Central Arizona (U.S.A.) there is a hill called Coon Butte, or Coon\r\nMountain. This so-called \"mountain\" rises to a height of only 130 to 160\r\nfeet above the surrounding plain, and has on its top a crater of 530 to\r\n560 feet deep; the bottom of the crater--which is dry--being thus 400 feet\r\nbelow the level of the surrounding country. This so-called \"crater\" is\r\nalmost circular and nearly three-quarters of a mile in diameter. It has\r\nbeen suggested that this \"crater\" was formed by the fall of an enormous\r\niron meteorite, or small asteroid. The \"crater\" has been carefully\r\nexamined by a geologist and a physicist. From the evidence and facts\r\nfound, the geologist (Mr. Barringer) states that \"they do not leave, in my\r\nmind, a scintilla of doubt that this mountain and its crater were produced\r\nby the impact of a huge meteorite or small asteroid.\" The physicist (Mr.\r\nTilghmann) says that he \"is justified, under due reserve as to\r\nsubsequently developed facts, in announcing that the formation at this\r\nlocality is due to the impact of a meteor of enormous and unprecedented\r\nsize.\" There are numerous masses of meteoric iron in the vicinity of the\r\n\"crater.\" The so-called Canyon Diabolo meteorite was found in a canyon of\r\nthat name about 2-1/2 miles from the Coon Mountain. The investigators\r\nestimate that the great meteoric fall took place \"not more than 5000 years\r\nago, perhaps much less.\" Cedar trees about 700 years old are now growing\r\non the rim of the mountain. From the results of artillery experiments, Mr.\r\nGilbert finds that \"a spherical projectile striking solid limestone with a\r\nvelocity of 1800 feet a second will penetrate to a depth of something less\r\nthan two diameters,\" and from this Mr. L. Fletcher concludes \"that a\r\nmeteorite of large size would not be prevented by the earth's atmosphere\r\nfrom having a penetration effect sufficient for the production of such a\r\ncrater.\"[238]\r\n\r\nThe meteoric origin of this remarkable \"crater\" is strongly favoured by\r\nMr. G. P. Merrill, Head Curator of Geology, U.S. National Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Canyon Diabolo meteorite above referred to was found to contain\r\ndiamonds! some black, others transparent. So some have said that \"the\r\ndiamond is a gift from Heaven,\" conveyed to earth in meteoric\r\nshowers.[239] But diamond-bearing meteorites would seem to be rather a\r\nfreak of nature. It does not follow that _all_ diamonds had their origin\r\nin meteoric stones. The mineral known as periodot is frequently found in\r\nmeteoric stones, but it is also a constituent of terrestrial rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1882 it was stated by Dr. Halm and Dr. Weinhand that they had\r\nfound fossil sponges, corals, and crinoids in meteoric stones! Dr.\r\nWeinhand thought he had actually determined three genera![240] But this\r\nstartling result was flatly contradicted by Carl Vogt, who stated that the\r\nsupposed fossils are merely crystalline conformations.[241]\r\n\r\nSome meteorites contain a large quantity of occluded gases, hydrogen,\r\nhelium, and carbon oxides. It is stated that Dr. Odling once \"lighted up\r\nthe theatre of the Royal Institution with gas brought down from\r\ninterstellar space by meteorites\"![242]\r\n\r\nOn February 10, 1896, a large meteorite burst over Madrid with a loud\r\nreport. The concussion was so great that many windows in the city were\r\nbroken, and some partitions in houses were shaken down![243]\r\n\r\nA very brilliant meteor or fireball was seen in daylight on June 9, 1900,\r\nat 2{h} 55{m} p.m. from various places in Surrey, Sussex, and near London.\r\nCalculations showed that \"the meteor began 59 miles in height over a point\r\n10 miles east of Valognes, near Cherbourg, France. Meteor ended 23 miles\r\nin height, over Calais, France. Length of path 175 miles. Radiant point,\r\n280°, 12°.\"[244]\r\n\r\nIt was decided some years ago \"in the American Supreme Court that a\r\nmeteorite, though a stone fallen from heaven, belongs to the owner of the\r\nfreehold interest in the land on which it falls, and not to the\r\ntenant.\"[245]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the fall of meteoric matter on the earth, Mr. Proctor\r\nsays, \"It is calculated by Dr. Kleiber of St. Petersburgh that 4250 lbs.\r\nof meteoric dust fall on the earth every hour--that is, 59 tons a day, and\r\nmore than 11,435 tons a year. I believe this to be considerably short of\r\nthe truth. It sounds like a large annual growth, and the downfall of such\r\nan enormous mass of meteoric matter seems suggestive of some degree of\r\ndanger. But in reality, Dr. Kleiber's estimate gives only about 25\r\nmillions of pounds annually, which is less than 2 ounces annually to each\r\nsquare mile of the earth's surface,\"[246] a quantity which is, of course,\r\nquite insignificant.\r\n\r\nAccording to Humboldt, Chladni states that a Franciscan monk was killed by\r\nthe fall of an aërolite at Milan in the year 1660.[247] Humboldt also\r\nmentions the death by meteoric stones of a monk at Crema on September 4,\r\n1511, and two Swedish sailors on board ship in 1674.[248]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that, according to Olbers, \"no fossil meteoric\r\nstones\" have ever been discovered.[249] Considering the number which are\r\nsupposed to have fallen to the earth in the course of ages, this fact\r\nseems a remarkable one.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1879, a shower of meteorites fell at Eitherville, Iowa\r\n(U.S.A.). Some of the fragments found weighed 437, 170, 92-1/2, 28,\r\n10-1/2, 4 and 2 lbs. in weight. In the following year (1880) when the\r\nprairie grass had been consumed by a fire, about \"5000 pieces were found\r\nfrom the size of a pin to a pound in weight.\"[250]\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Silvestria of Catania, a shower of meteoric dust mixed\r\nwith rain fell on the night of March 29, 1880. The dust contained a large\r\nproportion of iron in the metallic state. In size the particles varied\r\nfrom a tenth to a hundredth of a millimetre.[251]\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated that the average mass of a \"shooting star\" is only\r\na few grains. But from comparisons with an electric arc light, Prof. W.\r\nH. Pickering concludes that a meteor as bright as a third magnitude star,\r\ncomposed of iron or stone, would probably have a diameter of 6 or 7\r\ninches. An average bright fireball would perhaps measure 5 or 6 feet in\r\ndiameter.[252]\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Joshua we are told \"that the LORD cast down great stones\r\nfrom heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died\" (Joshua x. 11). In the\r\nlatter portion of the verse \"hailstones\" are mentioned, but as the\r\noriginal Hebrew word means stones in general (not hailstones), it seems\r\nvery probable that the stones referred to were aërolites.[253]\r\n\r\nThe stone mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, from which was found \"the\r\n_image_ which fell down from Jupiter\" (Acts xix. 35), was evidently a\r\nmeteoric stone.[253]\r\n\r\nThe famous stone in the Caaba at Mecca, is probably a stone of meteoric\r\norigin.[253]\r\n\r\n  I\r\n\r\n  \"Stones from Heaven! Can you wonder,\r\n    You who scrutinize the Earth,\r\n  At the love and veneration\r\n    They received before the birth\r\n  Of our scientific methods?\r\n\r\n\r\n  II\r\n\r\n  \"Stones from Heaven! we can handle\r\n    Fragments fallen from realms of Space;\r\n  Oh! the marvel and the mystery,\r\n    Could we understand their place\r\n  In the scheme of things created!\r\n\r\n\r\n  III\r\n\r\n  \"Stones from Heaven! With a mighty\r\n    Comet whirling formed they part?\r\n  Fell they from their lofty station\r\n    Like a brilliant fiery dart,\r\n  Hurl'd from starry fields of Night?\"[254]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe Zodiacal Light and Gegenschein\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Gruson and Brugsch, the Zodiacal Light was known in ancient\r\ntimes, and was even worshipped by the Egyptians. Strabo does not mention\r\nit; but Diodorus Siculus seems to refer to it (B.C. 373), and he probably\r\nobtained his information from some Greek writers before his time, possibly\r\nfrom Zenophon, who lived in the sixth century B.C.[255] Coming to the\r\nChristian era, it was noticed by Nicephorus, about 410 B.C. In the Koran,\r\nit is called the \"false Aurora\"; and it is supposed to be referred to in\r\nthe \"Rubáiyát\" of Omar Khayyam, the Persian astronomical poet, in the\r\nsecond stanza of that poem (Edward Fitzgerald's translation)--\r\n\r\n  \"Dreaming when Dawn's Left Hand was in the Sky,[256]\r\n  I heard a voice within the Tavern cry,\r\n  Awake, my Little ones, and fill the Cup,\r\n  Before Life's Liquor in its Cup be dry.\"\r\n\r\nIt was observed by Cassini in 1668,[257] and by Hooke in 1705. A short\r\ndescription of its appearance will be found in Childrey's _Britannia\r\nBaconica_ (1661), p. 183.\r\n\r\nThe finest displays of this curious light seem to occur between the middle\r\nof January and the middle of February. In February, 1856, Secchi found it\r\nbrighter than he had ever seen it before. It was yellowish towards the\r\naxis of the cone, and it seemed to be brighter than the Milky Way in\r\nCygnus. He described it as \"un grande spectacle.\" In the middle of\r\nFebruary, 1866, Mr. Lassell, during his last residence in Malta, saw a\r\nremarkable display of the Zodiacal Light. He found it at least twice as\r\nbright as the brightest part of the Milky Way, and much brighter than he\r\nhad previously seen it. He found that the character of its light differed\r\nconsiderably from that of the Milky Way. It was of a much redder hue than\r\nthe Galaxy. In 1874 very remarkable displays were seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of London in January and February of that year; and in 1875\r\non January 24, 25, and 30. On January 24 it was noticed that the \"light\"\r\nwas distinctly reddish and much excelled in brightness any portion of the\r\nMilky Way.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, who observed it from Andes (at a height of 13,000 to 15,000\r\nfeet), from Venezuela and from Cumana, tells us that he has seen the\r\nZodiacal Light equal in brightness to the Milky Way in Sagittarius.\r\n\r\nAs probably many people have never seen the \"light,\" a caution may be\r\ngiven to those who care to look for it. It is defined by the Rev. George\r\nJones, Chaplain to the \"United States' Japan Expedition\" (1853-55), as \"a\r\nbrightness that appears in the western sky after sunset, and in the east\r\nbefore sunrise; following nearly or quite the line of the ecliptic in the\r\nheavens, and stretching upwards to various elevations according to the\r\nseason of the year.\" From the description some might suppose that the\r\nlight is visible _immediately_ after sunset. But this is not so; it never\r\nappears until twilight is over and \"the night has fully set in.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"light\" is usually seen after sunset or before sunrise. But attempts\r\nhave recently been made by Prof. Simon Newcomb to observe it north of the\r\nsun. To avoid the effects of twilight the sun must be only slightly more\r\nthan 18° below the horizon (that is, a little before or after the longest\r\nday). This condition limits the place of observation to latitudes not much\r\nsouth of 46°; and to reduce atmospheric absorption the observing station\r\nshould be as high as possible above the level of the sea. Prof. Newcomb,\r\nobserving from the Brienzer Rothorn in Switzerland (latitude 46° 47' N.,\r\nlongitude 8° 3' E.), succeeded in tracing the \"light\" to a distance of 35°\r\nnorth of the sun. It would seem, therefore, that the Zodiacal Light\r\nenvelops the sun on all sides, but has a greater extension in the\r\ndirection of the ecliptic.[258] From observations at the Lick Observatory,\r\nMr. E. A. Fath found an extension of 46° north of the sun.[259]\r\n\r\nFrom observations of the \"light\" made by Prof. Barnard at the Yerkes\r\nObservatory during the summer of 1906, he finds that it extends to at\r\nleast 65° north of the sun, a considerably higher value than that found by\r\nProf. Newcomb.[260] The difference may perhaps be explained by actual\r\nvariation of the meteoric matter producing the light. Prof. J. H. Poynting\r\nthinks that possibly the Zodiacal Light is due to the \"dust of long dead\r\ncomets.\"[261]\r\n\r\nFrom careful observations of the \"light,\" Mr. Gavin J. Burns finds that\r\nits luminosity is \"some 40 or 50 per cent. brighter than the background of\r\nthe sky. Prof. Newcomb has made a precisely similar remark about the\r\nluminosity of the Milky Way, viz. that it is surprisingly small.\" This\r\nagrees with my own observations during many years. It is only on the\r\nfinest and clearest nights that the Milky Way forms a conspicuous object\r\nin the night sky. And this only in the country. The lights of a city\r\nalmost entirely obliterate it. Mr. Burns finds that the Zodiacal Light\r\nappears \"to be of a yellowish tint; or if we call it white, then the Milky\r\nWay is comparatively of a bluish tint.\" During my residence in the Punjab\r\nthe Zodiacal Light seemed to me constantly visible in the evening sky in\r\nthe spring months. In the west of Ireland I have seen it nearly as bright\r\nas the brightest portions of the Milky Way visible in this country\r\n(February 20, 1890). The \"meteoric theory\" of the \"light\" seems to be the\r\none now generally accepted by astronomers, and in this opinion I fully\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\nFrom observations made in Jamaica in the years 1899 and 1901, Mr. Maxwell\r\nHall arrived at the conclusion that \"the Zodiacal Light is caused by\r\nreflection of sunlight from masses of meteoric matter still contained in\r\nthe invariable plane, which may be considered the original plane of the\r\nsolar system.\"[262] According to Humboldt, Cassini believed that the\r\nZodiacal Light \"consisted of innumerably small planetary bodies revolving\r\nround the sun.\"[263]\r\n\r\nTHE GEGENSCHEIN, or COUNTER-GLOW.--This is a faint patch of light seen\r\nopposite the sun's place in the sky, that is on the meridian at midnight.\r\nIt is usually elliptical in shape, with its longer axis lying nearly in\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic. It seems to have been first detected by Brorsen\r\n(the discoverer of the short-period comet of 1846) about the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. But it is not easy to see, for the famous Heis of\r\nMünster, who had very keen eyesight, did not succeed in seeing it for\r\nseveral years after Brorsen's announcement.[264] It was afterwards\r\nindependently discovered by Backhouse, and Barnard.\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard's earlier observations seemed to show that the Gegenschein\r\ndoes not lie exactly opposite to the sun, but very nearly so. He found its\r\nlongitude is within one degree of 180°, and its latitude about 1°·3 north\r\nof the ecliptic.[265] But from subsequent observations he came to the\r\nconclusion that the differences in longitude and apparent latitude are due\r\nto atmospheric absorption, and that the object really lies in the ecliptic\r\nand _exactly_ opposite to the sun.[266]\r\n\r\nBarnard finds that the Gegenschein is not so faint as is generally\r\nsupposed. He says \"it is best seen by averted vision, the face being\r\nturned 60° or 70° to the right or left, and the eyes alone turned towards\r\nit.\" It is invisible in June and December, while in September it is round,\r\nwith a diameter of 20°, and very distinct. No satisfactory theory has yet\r\nbeen advanced to account for this curious phenomenon. Prof. Arthur Searle\r\nof Harvard attributes it to a number of asteroids too small to be seen\r\nindividually. When in \"opposition\" to the sun these would be fully\r\nilluminated and nearest to the earth. Its distance from the earth probably\r\nexceeds that of the moon. Dr. Johnson Stoney thinks that the Gegenschein\r\nmay possibly be due to a \"tail\" of hydrogen and helium gases repelled from\r\nthe earth by solar action; this \"tail\" being visible to us by reflected\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nIt was observed under favourable circumstances in January and February,\r\n1903, by the French astronomer, M. F. Quénisset. He found that it was\r\nbetter seen when the atmosphere was less clear, contrary to his experience\r\nof the Zodiacal Light. Prof. Barnard's experience confirms this. M.\r\nQuénisset notes that--as in the case of the Zodiacal Light--the southern\r\nborder of the Gegenschein is sharper than the northern. He found that its\r\nbrightness is less than that of the Milky Way between Betelgeuse and\r\n[Greek: g] Geminorum; and thinks that it is merely a strengthening of the\r\nZodiacal Light.[267]\r\n\r\nA meteoritic theory of the Gegenschein has been advanced by Prof. F. R.\r\nMoulton, which explains it by light reflected from a swarm of meteorites\r\nrevolving round the sun at a distance of 930,240 miles outside the earth's\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nBoth the Zodiacal Light and Gegenschein were observed by Herr Leo Brenner\r\non the evening of March 4, 1896. He found the Zodiacal Light on this\r\nevening to be \"_perhaps eight times brighter_ than the Milky Way in\r\nPerseus.\" The \"_Gegenschein distinctly visible_ as a round, bright,\r\ncloud-like nebula below Leo (Virgo), and about twice the brightness of the\r\nMilky Way in Monoceros between Canis Major and Canis Minor.\"[268]\r\n\r\nHumboldt thought that the fluctuations in the brilliancy of the Zodiacal\r\nLight were probably due to a real variation in the intensity of the\r\nphenomenon rather than to the elevated position of the observer.[269] He\r\nsays that he was \"astonished in the tropical climates of South America, to\r\nobserve the variable intensity of the light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe Stars\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny says that Hipparchus \"ventured to count the stars, a work arduous\r\neven for the Deity.\" But this was quite a mistaken idea. Those visible to\r\nthe naked eye are comparatively few in number, and the enumeration of\r\nthose visible in an opera-glass--which of course far exceed those which\r\ncan be seen by unaided vision--is a matter of no great difficulty. Those\r\nvisible in a small telescope of 2-3/4 inches aperture have all been\r\nobserved and catalogued; and even those shown on photographs taken with\r\nlarge telescopes can be easily counted. The present writer has made an\r\nattempt in this direction, and taking an average of a large number of\r\ncounts in various parts of the sky, as shown on stellar photographs, he\r\nfinds a total of about 64 millions for the whole sky in both\r\nhemispheres.[270] Probably the total number will not exceed 100 millions.\r\nBut this is a comparatively small number, even when compared with the\r\nhuman population of our little globe.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the charts made by photography in the International\r\nscheme commenced some years ago, it has now been estimated that the charts\r\nwill probably contain a total of about 9,854,000 stars down to about the\r\n14th magnitude (13·7). The \"catalogue plates\" (taken with a shorter\r\nexposure) will, it is expected, include about 2,676,500 stars down to\r\n11-1/2 magnitude. These numbers may, however, be somewhat increased when\r\nthe work has been completed.[271] If this estimate proves to be correct,\r\nthe number of stars visible down to the 14th magnitude will be\r\nconsiderably less than former estimates have made it.\r\n\r\nProf. E. C. Pickering estimates that the total number of stars visible on\r\nphotographs down to the 16th magnitude (about the faintest visible in the\r\ngreat Lick telescope) will be about 50 millions.[272] In the present\r\nwriter's enumeration, above referred to, many stars fainter than the 16th\r\nmagnitude were included.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth says, with reference to Sir William Herschel--perhaps the\r\ngreatest observer that ever lived--\"As to Sir William himself, he could\r\nunhesitatingly call every star down to the 6th magnitude, by its name,\r\nletter, or number.\"[273] This shows great powers of observation, and a\r\nwonderful memory.\r\n\r\nOn a photographic plate of the Pleiades taken with the Bruce telescope and\r\nan exposure of 6 hours, Prof. Bailey of Harvard has counted \"3972 stars\r\nwithin an area 2° square, having Alcyone at its centre.\"[274] This would\r\ngive a total of about 41 millions for the whole sky, if of the same\r\nrichness.\r\n\r\nWith an exposure of 16 hours, Prof. H. C. Wilson finds on an area of less\r\nthat 110' square a total of 4621 stars. He thinks, \"That all of these\r\nstars belong to the Pleiades group is not at all probable. The great\r\nmajority of them probably lie at immense distances beyond the group, and\r\nsimply appear in it by projection.\"[274] He adds, \"It has been found,\r\nhowever, by very careful measurements made during the last 75 years at the\r\nKönigsbergh and Yale Observatories, that of the sixty-nine brighter stars,\r\nincluding those down to the 9th magnitude, only eight show any certain\r\nmovement with reference to Alcyone. Since Alcyone has a proper motion or\r\ndrift of 6\" per century, this means that all the brightest stars except\r\nthe eight mentioned are drifting with Alcyone and so form a true cluster,\r\nat approximately the same distance from the earth. Six of the eight stars\r\nwhich show relative drift are moving in the opposite direction to the\r\nmovement of Alcyone, and at nearly the same rate, so that their motion is\r\nonly apparent. They are really stationary, while Alcyone and the rest of\r\nthe cluster are moving past them.\"[275] This tends to show that the faint\r\nstars are really _behind_ the cluster, and are unconnected with it.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular idea with some people that the Pole Star is the nearest of\r\nall the stars to the celestial pole. But photographs show that there are\r\nmany faint stars nearer to the pole than the Pole Star. The Pole Star is\r\nat present at a distance of 1° 13' from the real pole of the heavens, but\r\nit is slowly approaching it. The minimum distance will be reached in the\r\nyear 2104. From photographs taken by M. Flammarion at the Juvisy\r\nObservatory, he finds that there are at least 128 stars nearer to the pole\r\nthan the Pole Star! The nearest star to the pole was, in the year 1902, a\r\nsmall star of about 12-1/2 magnitude, which was distant about 4 minutes of\r\narc from the pole.[276] The estimated magnitude shows that the Pole Star\r\nis nearly 10,000 times brighter than this faint star!\r\n\r\nIt has been found that Sirius is bright enough to cast a shadow under\r\nfavourable conditions. On March 22, 1903, the distinguished French\r\nastronomer Touchet succeeded in photographing the shadow of a brooch cast\r\nby this brilliant star. The exposure was 1{h} 5{m}.\r\n\r\nMartinus Hortensius seems to have been the first to see stars in daylight,\r\nperhaps early in the seventeenth century. He mentions the fact in a letter\r\nto Gassendi dated October 12, 1636, but does not give the date of his\r\nobservation. Schickard saw Arcturus in broad daylight early in 1632. Morin\r\nsaw the same bright star half an hour after sunset in March, 1635.\r\n\r\nSome interesting observations were made by Professors Payne and H. C.\r\nWilson, in the summer of 1904, at Midvale, Montana (U.S.A.), at a height\r\nof 4790 feet above sea-level. At this height they found the air very clear\r\nand transparent. \"Many more stars were visible at a glance, and the\r\nfamiliar stars appeared more brilliant.... In the great bright cloud of\r\nthe Milky Way, between [Greek: b] and [Greek: g] Cygni, one could count\r\neasily sixteen or seventeen stars, besides the bright ones [Greek: ê] and\r\n[Greek: ch],[277] while at Northfield it is difficult to distinctly see\r\neight or nine with the naked eye.\" Some nebulæ and star fields were\r\nphotographed with good results by the aid of a 2-1/2-inch Darlot lens and\r\n3 hours' exposure.[278]\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard has taken some good stellar photographs with a lens of only\r\n1-1/2 inches in diameter, and 4 or 5 inches focus belonging to an\r\nordinary \"magic lantern\"! He says that these \"photographs with the small\r\nlens show us in the most striking manner how the most valuable and\r\nimportant information may be obtained with the simplest means.\"[279]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the rising and setting of the stars due to the earth's\r\nrotation on its axis, the late Sir George B. Airy, Astronomer Royal of\r\nEngland, once said to a schoolmaster, \"I should like to know how far your\r\npupils go into the first practical points for which reading is scarcely\r\nnecessary. Do they know that the stars rise and set? Very few people in\r\nEngland know it. I once had a correspondence with a literary man of the\r\nhighest rank on a point of Greek astronomy, and found that he did not know\r\nit!\"[280]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth says, \"I have been struck with the beautiful blue tint of\r\nthe smallest stars visible in my telescope. This, however, may be\r\nattributed to some optical peculiarity.\" This bluish colour of small stars\r\nagrees with the conclusion arrived at by Prof. Pickering in recent years,\r\nthat the majority of faint stars in the Milky Way have spectra of the\r\nSirian type and, like that brilliant star, are of a bluish white colour.\r\nSir William Herschel saw many stars of a redder tinge than other observers\r\nhave noticed. Admiral Smyth says, \"This may be owing to the effect of his\r\nmetallic mirror or to some peculiarity of vision, or perhaps both.\"[281]\r\n\r\nThe ancient astronomers do not mention any coloured stars except white and\r\nred. Among the latter they only speak of Arcturus, Aldebaran, Pollux,\r\nAntares, and Betelgeuse as of a striking red colour. To these Al-Sufi adds\r\nAlphard ([Greek: a] Hydræ).\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel remarked that no decidedly green or blue star \"has\r\never been noticed unassociated with a companion brighter than itself.\" An\r\nexception to Herschel's rule seems to be found in the case of the star\r\n[Greek: b] Libræ, which Admiral Smyth called \"pale emerald.\" Mr. George\r\nKnott observed it on May 19, 1852, as \"beautiful pale green\" (3·7 inches\r\nachromatic, power 80), and on May 9, 1872, as \"fine pale green\" (5·5\r\ninches achromatic, power 65).\r\n\r\nThe motion of stars in the line of sight, as shown by the\r\nspectroscope--should theoretically alter their brightness in the course of\r\ntime; those approaching the earth becoming gradually brighter, while those\r\nreceding should become fainter. But the distance of the stars is so\r\nenormous that even with very high velocities the change would not become\r\nperceptible for ages. Prof. Oudemans found that to change the brightness\r\nof a star by only one-tenth of a magnitude--a quantity barely perceptible\r\nto the eye-a number of years would be necessary, which is represented by\r\nthe formula\r\n\r\n      5916 years\r\n  -----------------\r\n  parallax × motion\r\n\r\nfor a star approaching the earth, and for a receding star\r\n\r\n  6195 years\r\n  ----------\r\n    p × m\r\n\r\nThis is in geographical miles, 1 geographical mile being equal to 4·61\r\nEnglish miles.\r\n\r\nReducing the above to English miles, and taking an average for both\r\napproaching and receding stars, we have\r\n\r\n  27,660 years\r\n  ------------\r\n     p × m\r\n\r\nwhere p = parallax in seconds of arc, and m = radial velocity in English\r\nmiles per second.\r\n\r\nProf. Oudemans found that the only star which could have changed in\r\nbrightness by one-tenth of a magnitude since the time of Hipparchus is\r\nAldebaran. This is taking its parallax as 0\"·52. But assuming the more\r\nreliable parallax 0\"·12 found by Dr. Elkin, this period is 4-1/3 times\r\nlonger. For Procyon, the period would be 5500 years.[282] The above\r\ncalculation shows how absurd it is to suppose that any star could have\r\ngained or lost in brightness by motion in the line of sight during\r\nhistorical times. The \"secular variation\" of stars is quite another\r\nthing. This is due to physical changes in the stars themselves.\r\n\r\nThe famous astronomer Halley, the second Astronomer Royal at Greenwich,\r\nsays (_Phil. Trans._, 1796), \"Supposing the number of 1st magnitude stars\r\nto be 13, at twice the distance from the sun there may be placed four\r\ntimes as many, or 52; which with the same allowance would nearly represent\r\nthe star we find to be of the 2nd magnitude. So 9 × 13, or 117, for those\r\nat three times the distance; and at ten times the distance 100 × 13, or\r\n1300 stars; of which distance may probably diminish the light of any of\r\nthe stars of the 1st magnitude to that of the 6th, it being but the\r\nhundredth part of what, at their present distance, they appear with.\" This\r\nagrees with the now generally accepted \"light ratio\" of 2·512 for each\r\nmagnitude, which makes a first magnitude star 100 times the light of a 6th\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1796,[283] the famous French astronomer Lalande\r\nobserved on the meridian a star of small 6th magnitude, the exact position\r\nof which he determined. On the 15th of the same month he again observed\r\nthe star, and the places found for 1800 refer to numbers 16292-3 of the\r\nreduced catalogue. In the observation of March 4 he attached the curious\r\nremark, \"Étoile singulière\" (the observation of March 15 is without\r\nnote). This remark of Lalande has puzzled observers who failed to find any\r\npeculiarity about the star. Indeed, \"the remark is a strange one for the\r\nobserver of so many thousands of stars to attach unless there was really\r\nsomething singular in the star's aspect at the time.\" On the evening of\r\nApril 18, 1887, the star was examined by the present writer, and the\r\nfollowing is the record in his observing book, \"Lalande's étoile\r\nsingulière (16292-3) about half a magnitude less than [Greek: ê] Cancri.\r\nWith the binocular I see two streams of small stars branching out from it,\r\nnorth preceding like the tails of comet.\" This may perhaps have something\r\nto do with Lalande's curious remark.\r\n\r\nThe star numbered 1647 in Baily's _Flamsteed Catalogue_ is now known to\r\nhave been an observation of the planet Uranus.[284]\r\n\r\nProf. Pickering states that the fainter stars photographed with the 8-inch\r\ntelescope at Cambridge (U.S.A.) are invisible to the eye in the 15-inch\r\ntelescope.[285]\r\n\r\nSir Norman Lockyer finds that the lines of sulphur are present in the\r\nspectrum of the bright star Rigel ([Greek: b] Orionis).[286]\r\n\r\nAbout 8-1/2° south of the bright star Regulus ([Greek: a] Leonis) is a\r\nfaint nebula (H I, 4 Sextantis). On or near this spot the Capuchin monk De\r\nRheita fancied he saw, in the year 1643, a group of stars representing\r\nthe napkin of S. Veronica--\"sudarium Veronicæ sive faciem Domini maxima\r\nsimilitudina in astris expressum.\" And he gave a picture of the napkin and\r\nstar group. But all subsequent observers have failed to find any trace of\r\nthe star group referred to by De Rheita![287]\r\n\r\nThe Bible story of the star of the Magi is also told in connection with\r\nthe birth of the sun-gods Osiris, Horus, Mithra, Serapis, etc.[288] The\r\npresent writer has also heard it suggested that the phenomenon may have\r\nbeen an apparition of Halley's comet! But as this famous comet is known to\r\nhave appeared in the year B.C. 11, and as the date of the Nativity was\r\nprobably not earlier than B.C. 5, the hypothesis seems for this (and other\r\nreasons) to be inadmissible. It has also been suggested that the\r\nphenomenon might have been an appearance of Tycho Brahé's temporary star\r\nof 1572, known as the \"Pilgrim star\"; but there seems to be no real\r\nfoundation for such an hypothesis. There is no reason to think that\r\n\"temporary\" or new stars ever appear a second time.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth has well said, \"It checks one's pride to recollect that if\r\nour sun with the whole system of planets, asteroids, and moons, and comets\r\nwere to be removed from the spectator to the distance of the nearest\r\nfixed star, not one of them would be visible, except the sun, which would\r\nthen appear but as a star of perhaps the 2nd magnitude. Nay, more, were\r\nthe whole system of which our globe forms an insignificant member, with\r\nits central luminary, suddenly annihilated, no effect would be produced on\r\nthose unconnected and remote bodies; and the only annunciation of such a\r\ncatastrophe in the Sidereal \"Times\" would be that a small star once seen\r\nin a distant quarter of the sky had ceased to shine.\"[289]\r\n\r\nProf. George C. Comstock finds that the average parallax of 67 selected\r\nstars ranging in brightness between the 9th and the 12th magnitude, is of\r\nthe value of 0\"·0051.[290] This gives a distance representing a journey\r\nfor light of about 639 years!\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Norris Russell thinks that nearly all the bright stars in the\r\nconstellation of Orion are practically at the same distance from the\r\nearth. His reasons for this opinion are: (1) the stars are similar in\r\ntheir spectra and proper motions, (2) their proper motions are small,\r\nwhich suggests a small parallax, and therefore a great distance from the\r\nearth. Mr. Russell thinks that the average parallax of these stars may\r\nperhaps be 0\"·005, which gives a distance of about 650 \"light\r\nyears.\"[291]\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Norman Lockyer's classification of the stars, the order\r\nof _increasing_ temperature is represented by the following, beginning\r\nwith those in the earliest stage of stellar evolution:--Nebulæ, Antares,\r\nAldebaran, Polaris, [Greek: a] Cygni, Rigel, [Greek: e] Tauri, [Greek: b]\r\nCrucis. Then we have the hottest stars represented by [Greek: e] Puppis,\r\n[Greek: g] Argus, and Alnitam ([Greek: e] Orionis). _Decreasing_\r\ntemperature is represented by (in order), Achernar, Algol, Markab, Sirius,\r\nProcyon, Arcturus, 19 Piscium, and the \"Dark Stars.\"[292] But other\r\nastronomers do not agree with this classification. Antares and Aldebaran\r\nare by some authorities considered to be _cooling_ suns.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ritter's views of the Constitution of the Celestial Bodies,\r\nif we \"divide the stars into three classes according to age corresponding\r\nto these three stages of development, we shall assign to the first class,\r\nA, those stars still in the nebular phase of development; to the second\r\nclass, B, those in the transient stage of greatest brilliancy; and to the\r\nclass C, those stars which have already entered into the long period of\r\nslow extinction. It should be noted in this classification that we refer\r\nto relative and not absolute age, since a star of slight mass passes\r\nthrough the successive phases of its development more rapidly than the\r\nstar of greater mass.\"[293] Ritter comes to the conclusion that \"the\r\nduration of the period in which the sun as a star had a greater brightness\r\nthan at present was very short in comparison with the period in which it\r\nhad and will continue to have a brightness differing only slightly from\r\nits present value.\"[294]\r\n\r\nIn a valuable and interesting paper on \"The Evolution of Solar\r\nStars,\"[295] Prof. Schuster says that \"measurements by E. F. Nichols on\r\nthe heat of Vega and Arcturus indicated a lower temperature for Arcturus,\r\nand confirms the conclusion arrived at on other grounds, that the hydrogen\r\nstars have a higher temperature than the solar stars.\" \"An inspection of\r\nthe ultraviolet region of the spectrum gives the same result. These\r\ndifferent lines of argument, all leading to the same result, justify us in\r\nsaying that the surface temperature of the hydrogen stars is higher than\r\nthat of the solar stars. An extension of the same reasoning leads to the\r\nbelief that the helium stars have a temperature which is higher still.\"\r\nHence we have Schuster, Hale, and Sir William Huggins in agreement that\r\nthe Sirian stars are hotter than the solar stars; and personally I agree\r\nwith these high authorities. The late Dr. W. E. Wilson, however, held the\r\nopinion that the sun is hotter that Sirius!\r\n\r\nSchuster thinks that Lane's law does not apply to the temperature of the\r\nphotosphere and the absorbing layers of the sun and stars, but only to the\r\nportions between the photosphere and the centre, which probably act like a\r\nperfect gas. On this view he says the interior might become \"hotter and\r\nhotter until the condensation had reached a point at which the laws of\r\ngaseous condensation no longer hold.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the stars having spectra of the 3rd and 4th type\r\n(usually orange and red in colour), Schuster says--\r\n\r\n    \"The remaining types of spectra belong to lower temperature still, as\r\n    in place of metallic lines, or in addition to them, certain bands\r\n    appear which experiments show us invariably belong to lower\r\n    temperature than the lines of the same element.\r\n\r\n    \"If an evolutionary process has been going on, which is similar for\r\n    all stars, there is little doubt that from the bright-line stars down\r\n    to the solar stars the order has been (1) helium or _Orion_ stars, (2)\r\n    hydrogen or Sirian stars, (3) calcium or Procyon stars, (4) solar or\r\n    Capellan stars.\"\r\n\r\nMy investigations on \"The Secular Variation of Starlight\" (_Studies in\r\nAstronomy_, chap. 17, and _Astronomical Essays_, chap. 12) based on a\r\ncomparison of Al-Sufi's star magnitudes (tenth century) with modern\r\nestimates and measures, tend strongly to confirm the above views.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the 3rd-type stars, such as Betelgeuse and Mira Ceti,\r\nSchuster says, \"It has been already mentioned that observers differ as to\r\nwhether their position is anterior to the hydrogen or posterior to the\r\nsolar stars, and there are valid arguments on both sides.\"\r\n\r\nScheiner, however, shows, from the behaviour of the lines of magnesium,\r\nthat stars of type I. (Sirian) are the hottest, and type III. the coolest,\r\nand he says, we have \"for the first time a direct proof of the correctness\r\nof the physical interpretation of Vogel's spectral classes, according to\r\nwhich class II. is developed by cooling from I., and III. by a further\r\nprocess of cooling from II.\"[296]\r\n\r\nProf. Hale says that \"the resemblance between the spectra of sun-spots and\r\nof 3rd-type stars is so close as to indicate that the same cause is\r\ncontrolling the relative intensities of many lines in both instances. This\r\ncause, as the laboratory work indicates, is to be regarded as reduced\r\ntemperature.\"[297]\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Schuster, \"a spectrum of bright lines may be given by a\r\nmass of luminous gas, even if the gas is of great thickness. There is,\r\ntherefore, no difficulty in explaining the existence of stars giving\r\nbright lines.\" He thinks that the difference between \"bright line\" stars\r\nand those showing dark lines depends upon the rate of increase of the\r\ntemperature from the surface towards the centre. If this rate is slow,\r\nbright lines will be seen. If the rate of increase is rapid, the\r\ndark-line spectrum shown by the majority of the stars will appear. This\r\nrate, he thinks, is regulated by the gravitational force. So that in the\r\nearly stages of condensation bright lines are more likely to occur. \"If\r\nthe light is not fully absorbed,\" both bright and dark lines of the same\r\nelement may be visible in the same star. Schuster considers it quite\r\npossible that if we could remove the outer layers of the Sun's atmosphere,\r\nwe should obtain a spectrum of bright lines.[298]\r\n\r\nM. Stratonoff finds that stars having spectra of the Orion and Sirian\r\ntypes--supposed to represent an early stage in stellar evolution--tend to\r\ncongregate in or near the Milky Way. Star clusters in general show a\r\nsimilar tendency, \"but to this law the globular clusters form an\r\nexception.\"[299] We may add that the spiral nebulæ--which seem to be\r\nscattered indifferently over all parts of the sky--also seem to form an\r\nexception; for the spectra of these wonderful objects seem to show that\r\nthey are really star clusters, in which the components are probably\r\nrelatively small; that is, small in comparison with our sun.\r\n\r\nIf we accept the hypothesis that suns and systems were evolved from\r\nnebulæ, and if we consider the comparatively small number of nebulæ\r\nhitherto discovered in the largest telescopes--about half a million; and\r\nif we further consider the very small number of red stars, or those having\r\nspectra of the third and fourth types--usually considered to be dying-out\r\nsuns--we seem led to the conclusion that our sidereal system is now at\r\nabout the zenith of its life-history; comparatively few nebulæ being left\r\nto consolidate into stars, and comparatively few stars having gone far on\r\nthe road to the final extinction of their light.\r\n\r\nProf. Boss of Albany (U.S.A.) finds that about forty stars of magnitudes\r\nfrom 3-1/2 to 7 in the constellation Taurus are apparently drifting\r\ntogether towards one point. These stars are included between about R.A.\r\n3{h} 47{m} to 5{h} 4{m}, and Declination + 5° to + 23° (that is, in the\r\nregion surrounding the Hyades). These motions apparently converge to a\r\npoint near R.A. 6{h}, Declination + 7° (near Betelgeuse). Prof. Boss has\r\ncomputed the velocity of the stars in this group to be 45·6 kilometres\r\n(about 28 miles) a second towards the \"vanishing point,\" and he estimated\r\nthe average parallax of the group to be 0\"·025--about 130 years' journey\r\nfor light. Although the motions are apparently converging to a point, it\r\ndoes not follow that the stars in question will, in the course of ages,\r\nmeet at the \"vanishing point.\" On the contrary, the observed motions show\r\nthat the stars are moving in parallel lines through space. About 15\r\nkilometres of the observed speed is due to the sun's motion through space\r\nin the opposite direction. Prof. Campbell finds from spectroscopic\r\nmeasures that of these forty stars, nine are receding from the earth with\r\nvelocities varying from 12 to 60 kilometres a second, and twenty-three\r\nothers with less velocities than 38 kilometres.[300] It will be obvious\r\nthat, as there is a \"vanishing point,\" the motion in the line of sight\r\nmust be one of _recession_ from the earth.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that on an average the parallax of a star is about\r\none-seventh of its \"proper motion.\"[301]\r\n\r\nAdopting Prof. Newcomb's parallax of 0\"·14 for the famous star 1830\r\nGroombridge, the velocity perpendicular to the line of sight is about 150\r\nmiles a second. The velocity _in_ the line of sight--as shown by the\r\nspectroscope--is 59 miles a second approaching the earth. Compounding\r\nthese two velocities we find a velocity through space of about 161 miles a\r\nsecond!\r\n\r\nAn eminent American writer puts into the mouth of one of his characters, a\r\nyoung astronomer, the following:--\r\n\r\n                          \"I read the page\r\n  Where every letter is a glittering sun.\"\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the heat radiated by some bright stars, made by\r\nDr. E. F. Nicholls in America with a very sensitive radiometer of his own\r\nconstruction, he finds that \"we do not receive from Arcturus more heat\r\nthan we should from a candle at a distance of 5 or 6 miles.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the progressive motion of light, and the different times\r\ntaken by light to reach the earth from different stars, Humboldt says,\r\n\"The aspect of the starry heavens presents to us objects of _unequal\r\ndate_. Much has long ceased to exist before the knowledge of its presence\r\nreaches us; much has been otherwise arranged.\"[302]\r\n\r\nThe photographic method of charting the stars, although a great\r\nimprovement on the old system, seems to have its disadvantages. One of\r\nthese is that the star images are liable to disappear from the plates in\r\nthe course of time. The reduction of stellar photograph plates should,\r\ntherefore, be carried out as soon as possible after they are taken. The\r\nlate Dr. Roberts found that on a plate originally containing 364 stars, no\r\nless than 130 had completely disappeared in 9-1/4 years!\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed by some writers on astronomy that the faint stars\r\nvisible on photographs of the Pleiades are at practically the same\r\ndistance from the earth as the brighter stars of the cluster, and that\r\nconsequently there must be an enormous difference in actual size between\r\nthe brighter and fainter stars. But there is really no warrant for any\r\nsuch assumption. Photographs of the vicinity show that the sky all round\r\nthe Pleiades is equally rich in faint stars. It seems, therefore, more\r\nreasonable to suppose that most of the faint stars visible in the Pleiades\r\nare really far behind the cluster in space. For if _all_ the faint stars\r\nvisible on photographs belonged to the cluster, then if we imagine the\r\ncluster removed, a \"hole\" would be left in the sky, which is of course\r\nutterly improbable, and indeed absurd. An examination of the proper\r\nmotions tends to confirm this view of the matter, and indicates that the\r\nPleiades cluster is a comparatively small one and simply projected on a\r\nbackground of fainter stars.\r\n\r\nIt has long been suspected that the famous star 61 Cygni, which is a\r\ndouble star, forms a binary system--that is, that the two stars composing\r\nit revolve round their common centre of gravity and move together through\r\nspace. But measures of parallax made by Herman S. Davis and Wilsing seem\r\nto show a difference of parallax between the two components of about 0·08\r\nof a second of arc. This difference of parallax implies a distance of\r\nabout 2-1/4 \"light years\" between the two stars, and \"if this is correct,\r\nthe stars are too remote to form a binary system. The proper motions of\r\n5\"·21 and 5\"·15 seem to show that they are moving in nearly parallel\r\ndirections; but are probably slowly separating.\" Mr. Lewis, however,\r\nthinks that a physical connection probably exists.[303]\r\n\r\nDante speaks of the four bright stars of the Southern Cross as\r\nemblematical of the four cardinal virtues, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude,\r\nand Prudence; and he seems to refer to the stars Canopus, Achernar, and\r\nFoomalhaut under the symbols of Faith, Hope, and Charity. The so-called\r\n\"False Cross\" is said to be formed by the stars [Greek: k], [Greek: d],\r\n[Greek: e], and [Greek: i] of the constellation Argo Navis. But it seems\r\nto me that a better (although larger) cross is formed by the stars [Greek:\r\na] Centauri and [Greek: a], [Greek: b], and [Greek: g] of Triangulum\r\nAustralis.\r\n\r\nMr. Monck has pointed out that the names of the brightest stars seem to be\r\narranged alphabetically in order of colour, beginning with red and ending\r\nwith blue. Thus we have Aldebaran, Arcturus, Betelgeuse, Capella, Procyon,\r\nRegulus, Rigel, Sirius, Spica and Vega. But as the origin of these names\r\nis different, this must be merely a curious coincidence.[304] And, to my\r\neye at least, Betelgeuse is redder than Arcturus.\r\n\r\nThe poet Longfellow speaks of the--\r\n\r\n  \"Stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,\"[305]\r\n\r\nand Drayton says--\r\n\r\n  \"The stars to me an everlasting book\r\n  In that eternal register, the sky.\"[306]\r\n\r\nObserving at a height of 12,540 feet on the Andes, the late Dr. Copeland\r\nsaw Sirius with the naked eye less than 10 minutes before sunset.[307] He\r\nalso saw Jupiter 3{m} 47{s} before sunset; and the following bright\r\nstars--Canopus, 0{m} 52{s} before sunset; Rigel ([Greek: b] Orionis) 16{m}\r\n32{s} after sunset; and Procyon 11{m} 28{s} after sunset. From a height of\r\n12,050 feet at La Paz, Bolivia, he saw with the naked eye in February,\r\n1883, ten stars in the Pleiades in full moonlight, and seventeen stars in\r\nthe Hyades. He also saw [Greek: s] Tauri double.[308]\r\n\r\nHumboldt says, \"In whatever point the vault of heaven has been pierced by\r\npowerful and far-penetrating telescopic instruments, stars or luminous\r\nnebulæ are everywhere discoverable, the former in some cases not exceeding\r\nthe 20th or 24th degree of telescopic magnitude.\"[309] But this is a\r\nmistake. No star of even the 20th magnitude has ever been seen by any\r\ntelescope. Even on the best photographic plates it is doubtful that any\r\nstars much below the 18th magnitude are visible. To show a star of the\r\n20th magnitude--if such stars exist--would require a telescope of 144\r\ninches or 12 feet in aperture. To show a star of the 24th magnitude--if\r\nsuch there be--an aperture of 33 feet would be necessary![310]\r\n\r\nIt is a popular idea that stars may be seen in the daytime from the bottom\r\nof a deep pit or high chimney. But this has often been denied. Humboldt\r\nsays, \"While practically engaged in mining operations, I was in the habit,\r\nduring many years, of passing a great portion of the day in mines where I\r\ncould see the sky through deep shafts, yet I never was able to observe a\r\nstar.\"[311]\r\n\r\nStars may, however, be seen in the daytime with even small telescopes. It\r\nis said that a telescope of 1 inch aperture will show stars of the 2nd\r\nmagnitude; 2 inches, stars of the 3rd magnitude; and 4 inches, stars of\r\nthe 4th magnitude. But I cannot confirm this from personal observation. It\r\nmay be so, but I have not tried the experiment.\r\n\r\nSir George Darwin says--\r\n\r\n    \"Human life is too short to permit us to watch the leisurely procedure\r\n    of cosmical evolution, but the celestial museum contains so many\r\n    exhibits that it may become possible, by the aid of theory, to piece\r\n    together, bit by bit, the processes through which stars pass in the\r\n    course of their evolutions.\"[312]\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"telluric lines\" seen in the solar spectrum, are due to\r\nwater vapour in the earth's atmosphere. As the light of the stars also\r\npasses through the atmosphere, it is evident that these lines should also\r\nbe visible in the spectra of the stars. This is found to be the case by\r\nProf. Campbell, Director of the Lick Observatory, who has observed all the\r\nprincipal bands in the spectrum of every star he has examined.[313]\r\n\r\nThe largest \"proper motion\" now known is that of a star of the 8-1/2\r\nmagnitude in the southern hemisphere, known as Cordoba Zone V. No. 243.\r\nIts proper motion is 8·07 seconds of arc per annum, thus exceeding that of\r\nthe famous \"runaway star,\" 1830 Groombridge, which has a proper motion of\r\n7·05 seconds per annum. This greater motion is, however, only apparent.\r\nMeasures of parallax show that the southern \"runaway\" is much nearer to us\r\nthan its northern rival, its parallax being 0\"·32, while that of\r\nGroombridge 1830 is only 0\"·14. With these data the actual velocity across\r\nthe line of sight can be easily computed. That of the southern star comes\r\nout 80 miles a second, while that of Groombridge 1830 is 148 miles a\r\nsecond. The actual velocity of Arcturus is probably still greater.\r\n\r\nThe poet Barton has well said--\r\n\r\n  \"The stars! the stars! go forth at night,\r\n    Lift up thine eyes on high,\r\n  And view the countless orbs of light,\r\n    Which gem the midnight sky.\r\n  Go forth in silence and alone,\r\n    This glorious sight to scan,\r\n  And bid the humbled spirit own\r\n    The littleness of man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDouble and Binary Stars\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. R. G. Aitken, the eminent American observer of double stars, finds\r\nthat of all the stars down to the 9th magnitude--about the faintest\r\nvisible in a powerful binocular field-glass--1 in 18, or 1 in 20, on the\r\naverage, are double, with the component stars less than 5 seconds of arc\r\napart. This proportion of double stars is not, however, the same for all\r\nparts of the sky; while in some regions double stars are very scarce, in\r\nother places the proportion rises to 1 in 8.\r\n\r\nFor the well-known binary star Castor ([Greek: a] Geminorum), several\r\norbits have been computed with periods ranging from 232 years (Mädler) to\r\n1001 years (Doberck). But Burnham finds that \"the orbit is absolutely\r\nindeterminate at this time, and likely to remain so for another century or\r\nlonger.\"[314] Both components are spectroscopic binaries, and the system\r\nis a most interesting one.\r\n\r\nThe well-known companion of Sirius became invisible in all telescopes in\r\nthe year 1890, owing to its near approach to its brilliant primary. It\r\nremained invisible until August 20, 1896, when it was again seen by Dr.\r\nSee at the Lowell Observatory.[315] Since then its distance has been\r\nincreasing, and it has been regularly measured. The maximum distance will\r\nbe attained about the year 1922.\r\n\r\nThe star [Greek: b] Cephei has recently been discovered to be a\r\nspectroscopic binary with the wonderfully short period of 4{h} 34{m}\r\n11{s}. The orbital velocity is about 10-1/2 miles a second, and as this\r\nvelocity is not very great, the distance between the components must be\r\nvery small, and possibly the two component bodies are revolving in actual\r\ncontact. The spectrum is of the \"Orion type.\"[316]\r\n\r\nAccording to Slipher the spectroscopic binary [Greek: g] Geminorum has the\r\ncomparatively long period (for a spectroscopic binary) of about 3-1/2\r\nyears. This period is comparable with that of the telescopic binary\r\nsystem, [Greek: d] Equulei (period about 5·7 years). The orbit is quite\r\neccentric. I have shown elsewhere[317] that [Greek: g] Geminorum has\r\nprobably increased in brightness since the time of Al-Sufi (tenth\r\ncentury). Possibly its spectroscopic duplicity may have something to do\r\nwith the variation in its light.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the spectra of double stars, Mr. Maunder suggests that\r\nthe fact of the companion of a binary star showing a Sirian spectrum while\r\nthe brighter star has a solar spectrum may be explained by supposing that,\r\non the theory of fission, \"the smaller body when thrown off consisted of\r\nthe lighter elements, the heavier remaining in the principal star. In\r\nother words, in these cases spectral type depends upon original chemical\r\nconstitution, and not upon the stage of stellar development\r\nattained.\"[318]\r\n\r\nA curious paradox with reference to binary stars has recently come to\r\nlight. For many years it was almost taken for granted that the brighter\r\nstar of a pair had a larger mass than the fainter component. This was a\r\nnatural conclusion, as both stars are practically at the same distance\r\nfrom the earth. But it has been recently found that in some binary stars\r\nthe fainter component has actually the larger mass! Thus, in the binary\r\nstar [Greek: e] Hydræ, the \"magnitude\" of the component stars are 3 and 6,\r\nindicating that the brighter star is about 16 times brighter than the\r\nfainter component. Yet calculations by Lewis show that the fainter star\r\nhas 6 times the mass of the brighter, that is, contains 6 times the\r\nquantity of matter! In the well-known binary 70 Ophiuchi, Prey finds that\r\nthe fainter star has about 4 times the mass of the brighter! In 85\r\nPegasi, the brighter star is about 40 times brighter than its companion,\r\nwhile Furner finds that the mass of the fainter star is about 4 times that\r\nof the brighter! And there are other similar cases. In fact, in these\r\nremarkable combinations of suns the fainter star is really the \"primary,\"\r\nand is, so far as mass is concerned, \"the predominant partner.\" This is a\r\ncurious anomaly, and cannot be well explained in the present state of our\r\nknowledge of stellar systems. In the case of [Greek: a] Centauri the\r\nmasses of the components are about equal, while the primary star is about\r\n3 times brighter than the other. But here the discrepancy is\r\nsatisfactorily explained by the difference in character of the spectra,\r\nthe brighter component having a spectrum of the solar type, while the\r\nfainter seems further advanced on the downward road of evolution, that is,\r\nmore consolidated and having, perhaps, less intrinsic brightness of\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Sirius and its faint attendant, the mass of the bright star\r\nis about twice the mass of the satellite, while its light is about 40,000\r\ntimes greater! Here the satellite is either a cooled-down sun or perhaps a\r\ngaseous nebula. There seems to be no other explanation of this curious\r\nparadox. The same remark applies to Procyon, where the bright star is\r\nabout 100,000 times brighter than its faint companion, although its mass\r\nis only 5 times greater.\r\n\r\nThe bright star Capella forms a curious anomaly or paradox. Spectroscopic\r\nobservations show that it is a very close binary pair. It has been seen\r\n\"elongated\" at the Greenwich Observatory with the great 28-inch\r\nrefractor--the work of Sir Howard Grubb--and the spectroscopic and visual\r\nmeasurements agree in indicating that its mass is about 18 times the mass\r\nof the sun. But its parallax (about 0\"·08) shows that it is about 128\r\ntimes brighter than the sun! This great brilliancy is inconsistent with\r\nthe star's computed mass, which would indicate a much smaller brightness.\r\nThe sun placed at the distance of Capella would, I find, shine as a star\r\nof about 5-1/2 magnitude, while Capella is one of the brightest stars in\r\nthe sky. As the spectrum of Capella's light closely resembles the solar\r\nspectrum, we seem justified in assuming that the two bodies have pretty\r\nmuch the same physical composition. The discrepancy between the computed\r\nand actual brightness of the star cannot be explained satisfactorily, and\r\nthe star remains an astronomical enigma.\r\n\r\nThree remarkable double-star systems have been discovered by Dr. See in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. The first of these is the bright star [Greek: a]\r\nPhoenicis, of which the magnitude is 2·4, or only very slightly fainter\r\nthan the Pole Star. It is attended by a faint star of the 13th magnitude\r\nat a distance of less than 10 seconds (1897). The bright star is of a\r\ndeep orange or reddish colour, and the great difference in brightness\r\nbetween the component stars \"renders the system both striking and\r\ndifficult.\" The second is [Greek: m] Velorum, a star of the 3rd magnitude,\r\nwhich has a companion of the 11th magnitude, and only 2-1/2\" from its\r\nbright primary (1897). Dr. See describes this pair as \"one of the most\r\nextraordinary in the heavens.\" The third is [Greek: ê] Centauri, of 2-1/2\r\nmagnitude, with a companion of 13-1/2 magnitude at a distance of 5\"·65\r\n(1897); colours yellow and purple. This pair is \"extremely difficult,\r\nrequiring a powerful telescope to see it.\" Dr. See thinks that these three\r\nobjects \"may be regarded as amongst the most splendid in the heavens.\"\r\n\r\nThe following notes are from Burnham's recently published _General\r\nCatalogue of Double Stars_.\r\n\r\nThe Pole Star has a well-known companion of about the 9th magnitude, which\r\nis a favourite object for small telescopes. Burnham finds that the bright\r\nstar and its faint companion are \"relatively fixed,\" and are probably only\r\nan \"optical pair.\" Some other companions have been suspected by amateur\r\nobservers, but Burnham finds that \"there is nothing nearer\" than the known\r\ncompanion within the reach of the great 36-inch telescope of the Lick\r\nObservatory (_Cat._, p. 299).\r\n\r\nThe well-known companion to the bright star Rigel ([Greek: b] Orionis)\r\nhas been suspected for many years to be a close double star. Burnham\r\nconcludes that it is really a binary star, and its \"period may be shorter\r\nthan that of any known pair\" (_Cat._, p. 411).\r\n\r\nBurnham finds that the four brighter stars in the trapezium in the great\r\nOrion nebula (in the \"sword\") are relatively fixed (_Cat._, p. 426).\r\n\r\n[Greek: g] Leonis. This double star was for many years considered to be a\r\nbinary, but Burnham has shown that all the measures may be satisfactorily\r\nrepresented by a straight line, and that consequently the pair merely\r\nforms an \"optical double.\"\r\n\r\n42 Comæ Berenices. This is a binary star of which the orbit plane passes\r\nnearly through the earth. The period is about 25-1/2 years, and Burnham\r\nsays the orbit \"is as accurately known as that of any known binary.\"\r\n\r\n[Greek: s] Coronæ Borealis. Burnham says that the orbits hitherto\r\ncomputed--with periods ranging from 195 years (Jacob) to 846 years\r\n(Doberck) are \"mere guess work,\" and it will require the measures of at\r\nleast another century, and perhaps a much longer time, to give an\r\napproximate period (_Cat._, p. 209). So here is some work left for\r\nposterity to do in this field.\r\n\r\n70 Ophiuchi. With reference to this well-known binary star, Burnham says,\r\n\"the elements of the orbit are very accurately known.\" The periods\r\ncomputed range from 86·66 years (Doolittle) to 98·15 years (Powell). The\r\npresent writer found a period of 87·84 years, which cannot be far from the\r\ntruth. Burnham found 87·75 years (_Cat._, p. 774). In this case there is\r\nnot much left for posterity to accomplish.\r\n\r\n61 Cygni. With reference to this famous star Burnham says, \"So far the\r\nrelative motion is practically rectilinear. If the companion is moving in\r\na curved path, it will require the measures of at least another\r\nhalf-century to make this certain. The deviation of the measured positions\r\nduring the last 70 years from a right line are less than the average\r\nerrors of the observations.\"\r\n\r\nBurnham once saw a faint companion to Sirius of the 16th magnitude, and\r\nmeasured its position with reference to the bright star (280°·6: 40\"·25:\r\n1899·86). But he afterwards found that it was \"not a real object but a\r\nreflection from Sirius\" (in the eye-piece). Such false images are called\r\n\"ghosts.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the well-known double (or rather quadruple) star [Greek:\r\ne] Lyræ, near Vega, and supposed faint stars near it, Burnham says, \"From\r\ntime to time various small stars in the vicinity have been mapped, and\r\nmuch time wasted in looking for and speculating about objects which only\r\nexist in the imagination of the observer.\" He believes that many of these\r\nfaint stars, supposed to have been seen by various observers, are merely\r\n\"ghosts produced by reflection.\"\r\n\r\nThe binary star [Greek: z] Boötis, which has long been suspected of small\r\nand irregular variation of light, showed remarkable spectral changes in\r\nthe year 1905,[319] somewhat similar to those of a _nova_, or temporary\r\nstar. It is curious that such changes should occur in a star having an\r\nordinary Sirian type of spectrum!\r\n\r\nA curious quadruple system has been discovered by Mr. R. T. A. Innes in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. The star [Greek: k] Toucani is a binary star with\r\ncomponents of magnitudes 5 and 7·7, and a period of revolution of perhaps\r\nabout 1000 years. Within 6' of this pair is another star (Lacaille 353),\r\nwhich is also a binary, with a period of perhaps 72 years. Both pairs have\r\nthe same proper motion through space, and evidently form a vast quadruple\r\nsystem; for which Mr. Innes finds a possible period of 300,000 years.[320]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that the performance of a really good refracting\r\ntelescope actually exceeds what theory would indicate! at least so far as\r\ndouble stars are concerned. For example, the famous double-star observer\r\nDawes found that the distance between the components of a double star\r\nwhich can just be divided, is found by dividing 4\"·56 by the aperture of\r\nthe object-glass in inches. Now theory gives 5\"·52 divided by the\r\naperture. \"The actual telescope--if a really good one--thus exceeds its\r\ntheoretical requirements. The difference between theory and practice in\r\nthis case seems to be due to the fact that in the 'spurious' star disc\r\nshown by good telescopes, the illumination at the edges of the star disc\r\nis very feeble, so that its full size is not seen except in the case of a\r\nvery bright star.\"[321]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nVariable Stars\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that interesting work _A Cycle of Celestial Objects_, Admiral Smyth\r\nsays (p. 275), \"Geminiano Montanari, as far back as 1670, was so struck\r\nwith the celestial changes, that he projected a work to be intituled the\r\n_Instabilities of the Firmament_, hoping to show such alterations as would\r\nbe sufficient to make even Aristotle--were he alive--reverse his opinion\r\non the incorruptibility of the spangled sky: 'There are now wanting in the\r\nheavens,' said he, 'two stars of the 2nd magnitude in the stem and yard of\r\nthe ship Argo. I and others observed them in the year 1664, upon occasion\r\nof the comet that appeared in that year. When they first disappeared I\r\nknow not; only I am sure that on April 10, 1668, there was not the least\r\nglimpse of them to be seen.'\" Smyth adds, \"Startling as this account\r\nis--and I am even disposed to question the fact--it must be recollected\r\nthat Montanari was a man of integrity, and well versed in the theory and\r\npractice of astronomy; and his account of the wonder will be found--in\r\ngood set Latin--in page 2202 of the _Philosophical Transactions_ for\r\n1671.\"\r\n\r\nThere must be, I think--as Smyth suggests--some mistake in Montanari's\r\nobservations, for it is quite certain that of the stars mentioned by\r\nPtolemy (second century A.D.) there is no star of the 2nd magnitude now\r\nmissing. It is true that Al-Sufi (tenth century) mentions a star of the\r\n_third_ magnitude mentioned by Ptolemy in the constellation of the Centaur\r\n(about 2° east of the star [Greek: e] Centauri) which he could not find.\r\nBut this has nothing to do with Montanari's stars. Montanari's words are\r\nvery clear. He says, \"_Desunt in Coelo duæ stellæ_ Secundæ Magnitudinis\r\n_in_ Puppi Navis _ejusve Transtris_ Bayero [Greek: b] et [Greek: g],\r\n_prope_ Canem Majoris, _à me et aliis, occasione præsertim Cometæ_ A. 1664\r\n_observatæ et recognitæ. Earum Disparitionem_ cui Anno debeam, non novi;\r\n_hoc indubium, quod à die_ 10 April, 1668, _ne_ vestigium quidem _illarum\r\nadesse amplius observe; cæteris circa eas etium quartæ et quintæ\r\nmagnitudinis, immotis._\" So the puzzle remains unsolved.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel thought that \"of all stars which are singly visible,\r\nabout one in thirty are undergoing an observable change.\"[322] Now taking\r\nthe number of stars visible to the naked eye at 6000, this would give\r\nabout 200 variable stars visible at maximum to the unaided vision. But\r\nthis estimate seems too high. Taking all the stars visible in the largest\r\ntelescopes--possibly about 100 millions--the proportion of variable stars\r\nwill probably be much smaller still.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the variation of light in the variable stars of the Algol\r\ntype is due to a partial eclipse by a companion star (not necessarily a\r\ndark body) is now well established by the spectroscope, and is accepted by\r\nall astronomers. The late Miss Clarke has well said \"to argue this point\r\nwould be _enforcer une porte ouverte_.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. A. W. Roberts, the components of the following \"Algol\r\nvariables\" \"revolve in contact\": V Puppis, X Carinæ, [Greek: b] Lyræ, and\r\n[Greek: u] Pegasi. Of those V Puppis and [Greek: b] Lyræ are known\r\nspectroscopic binaries. The others are beyond the reach of the\r\nspectroscope, owing to their faintness.\r\n\r\nA very curious variable star of the Algol type is that known as R R\r\nDraconis. Its normal magnitude is 10, but at minimum it becomes invisible\r\nin a 7-1/2-inch refracting telescope. The variation must, therefore, be\r\nover 3 magnitudes, that is, at minimum its light must be reduced to about\r\none-sixteenth of its normal brightness. The period of variation from\r\nmaximum to minimum is about 2·83 days. The variation of light near minimum\r\nis extraordinarily rapid, the light decreasing by about 1 magnitude in\r\nhalf an hour.[323]\r\n\r\nA very remarkable variable star has been recently discovered in the\r\nconstellation Auriga. Prof. Hartwig found it of the 9th magnitude on March\r\n6, 1908, the star \"having increased four magnitudes in one day, whilst\r\nwithin eight days it was less than the 14th magnitude.\"[324] In other\r\nwords its light increased at least one-hundredfold in eight days!\r\n\r\nThe period of the well-known variable star [Greek: b] Lyræ seems to be\r\nslowly increasing. This Dr. Roberts (of South Africa) considers to be due\r\nto the component stars slowly receding from each other. He finds that \"a\r\nvery slight increase of one-thousandth part of the radius of the orbit\r\nwould account for the augmentation in time, 30{m} in a century.\" According\r\nto the theory of stellar evolution the lengthening of the period of\r\nrevolution of a binary star would be due to the \"drag\" caused by the tides\r\nformed by each component on the other.[325]\r\n\r\nM. Sebastian Albrecht finds that in the short-period variable star known\r\nas T Vulpeculæ (and other variables of this class, such as Y Ophiuchi),\r\nthere can be no eclipse to explain the variation of light (as in the case\r\nof Algol). The star is a spectroscopic binary, it is true, but the\r\nmaximum of light coincides with the greatest velocity of _approach_ in\r\nthe line of sight, and the minimum with the greatest velocity of\r\n_recession_. Thus the light curve and the spectroscopic velocity curve are\r\nvery similar in shape, but one is like the other turned upside down. \"That\r\nis, the two curves have a very close correspondence in phase in addition\r\nto correspondence of shape and period.\"[326]\r\n\r\nThe star now known as W Ursæ Majoris (the variability of which was\r\ndiscovered by Müller and Kempf in 1902), and which lies between the stars\r\n[Greek: th] and [Greek: u] of that constellation, has the marvellously\r\nshort period of 4 hours (from maximum to maximum). Messrs. Jordan and\r\nParkhurst (U.S.A.), find from photographic plates that the star varies\r\nfrom 7·24 to 8·17 magnitude.[327] The light at maximum is, therefore, more\r\nthan double the light at minimum. A sun which loses more than half its\r\nlight and recovers it again in the short period of 4 hours is certainly a\r\ncurious and wonderful object.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the above, the same astronomers have discovered a star in\r\nPerseus which seems to vary from about the 6th to the 7th magnitude in the\r\nvery long period of 7-1/2 years! It is now known as X Persei, and its\r\nposition for 1900 is R.A. 3{h} 49{m} 8{s}, Dec. N. 30° 46', or about one\r\ndegree south-east of the star [Greek: z] Persei. It seems to be a\r\nvariable of the Algol type, as the star remained constant in light at\r\nabout the 6th magnitude from 1887 to 1891. It then began to fade, and on\r\nDecember 1, 1897, it was reduced to about the 7th magnitude.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 20, 1886, Prof. Colbert, of Chicago, noticed that\r\nthe star [Greek: z] Cassiopeiæ increased in brightness \"by quite half a\r\nmagnitude, and about half an hour afterwards began to return to its normal\r\nmagnitude.\"[328] This curious outburst of light in a star usually constant\r\nin brightness is (if true) a very unusual phenomenon. But a somewhat\r\nsimilar fluctuation of light is recorded by the famous German astronomer\r\nHeis. On September 26, 1850, he noted that the star \"[Greek: z] Lyræ\r\nbecame, for a moment, _very bright_, and then again faint.\" (The words in\r\nhis original observing book are: \"[Greek: z] Lyræ wurde einen _Moment sehr\r\nhell_ und hierauf wieder dunkel.\") As Heis was a remarkably accurate\r\nobserver of star brightness, the above remark deserves the highest\r\nconfidence.[329]\r\n\r\nThe variable star known as the V Delphini was found to be invisible in the\r\ngreat 40-inch telescope of the Yerkes Observatory on July 20, 1900. Its\r\nmagnitude was, therefore, below the 17th. At its maximum brightness it is\r\nabout 7-1/2, or easily visible in an ordinary opera-glass, so that its\r\nrange of variation is nearly, or quite, ten magnitudes. That is, its light\r\nat maximum is about 10,000 times its light at minimum. That a sun should\r\nvary in light to this enormous extent is certainly a wonderful fact. A\r\nvariable discovered by Ceraski (and numbered 7579 in Chandlers' Catalogue)\r\n\"had passed below the limit of the 40-inch in June, 1900, and was,\r\ntherefore, not brighter than 17 mag.\"[330]\r\n\r\nThe late Sir C. E. Peck and his assistant, Mr. Grover, made many valuable\r\nobservations of variable stars at the Rousden Observatory during many\r\nyears past. Among other interesting things noted, Peck sometimes saw faint\r\nstars in the field of view of his telescope which were at other times\r\ninvisible for many months, and he suggested that these are faint variable\r\nstars with a range of brightness from the 13th to the 20th magnitude. He\r\nadds, \"Here there is a practically unemployed field for the largest\r\ntelescopes.\" Considering the enormous number of faint stars visible on\r\nstellar photographs the number of undiscovered variable stars must be very\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth describes a small star near [Greek: b] Leonis, about 5'\r\ndistant, of about 8th magnitude, and dull red. In 1864 Mr. Knott measured\r\na faint star close to Smyth's position, but estimated it only 11·6\r\nmagnitude. The Admiral's star would thereupon seem to be variable.[331]\r\n\r\nThe famous variable star [Greek: ê] Argus, which Sir John Herschel, when\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope in 1838, saw involved in dense nebulosity, was in\r\nApril, 1869, \"seen on the bare sky,\" with the great Melbourne telescope,\r\n\"the nebula having disappeared for some distance round it.\" Other changes\r\nwere noticed in this remarkable nebula. The Melbourne observers saw \"three\r\ntimes as many stars as were seen by Herschel.\" But of course their\r\ntelescope is much larger--48 inches aperture, compared with Herschel's 20\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nProf. E. C. Pickering thinks that the fluctuations of light of the\r\nwell-known variable star R Coronæ (in the Northern Crown), \"are unlike\r\nthose of any known variable.\" This very curious object--one of the most\r\ncurious in the heavens--sometimes remains for many months almost constant\r\nin brightness (just visible to the naked eye), and then rapidly fades in\r\nlight by several magnitudes! Thus its changes of light in April and May,\r\n1905, were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1905, April 1   6·0 magnitude\r\n          \"  11   7·3     \"\r\n          \"  12   8·4     \"\r\n         May  1  11·4     \"\r\n          \"   7  12·5     \"\r\n\r\nThus between April 1 and May 1, its light was reduced by over 5\r\nmagnitudes. In other words, the light of the star on May 1 was reduced to\r\nless than one-hundredth of its light on April 1. If our sun were to\r\nbehave in this way nearly all life would soon be destroyed on the face of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nM. H. E. Lau finds that the short-period variable star [Greek: d] Cephei\r\nvaries slightly in colour as well as in light, and that the colour curve\r\nis parallel to the light curve. Near the minimum of light the colour is\r\nreddish yellow, almost as red as [Greek: z] Cephei; a day later it is pure\r\nyellow, and of about the same colour as the neighbouring [Greek: e]\r\nCephei.[332] But it would not be easy to fully establish such slight\r\nvariations of tint.\r\n\r\nA remarkably bright maximum of the famous variable Mira Ceti occurred in\r\n1906. In December of that year it was fully 2nd magnitude. The present\r\nwriter estimated it 1·8, or nearly equal to the brightest on record--1·7\r\nobserved by Sir William Herschel and Wargentin in the year 1779. From\r\nphotographs of the spectrum taken by Mr. Slipher at the Lowell Observatory\r\nin 1907, he finds strong indications of the presence of the rather rare\r\nelement vanadium in the star's surroundings. Prof. Campbell finds with the\r\nMills spectrograph attached to the great 36-inch telescope of the Lick\r\nObservatory that Mira is receding from the earth at the apparently\r\nconstant velocity of about 38 miles a second.[333] This, of course, has\r\nnothing to do with the variation in the star's light. Prof. Campbell\r\nfailed to see any trace of the green line of hydrogen in the star's\r\nspectrum, while two other lines of the hydrogen series \"glowed with\r\nsingular intensity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Newall has found evidence of the element titanium in the spectrum of\r\nBetelgeuse ([Greek: a] Orionis); Mr. Goatcher and Mr. Lunt (of the Cape\r\nObservatory) find tin in Antares (and Scorpii). If the latter observation\r\nis confirmed it will be the first time this metal has been found in a\r\nstar's atmosphere.[334]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that Al-Sufi (tenth century) does not mention the\r\nstar [Greek: e] Aquilæ, which lies closely north-west of [Greek: z]\r\nAquilæ, as it is now quite conspicuous to the naked eye. It was suspected\r\nof variation by Sir William Herschel. It was first recorded by Tycho Brahé\r\nabout 1590, and he called it 3rd magnitude. Bayer also rated it 3, and\r\nsince his time it has been variously estimated from 3-1/2 to 4. If it was\r\nanything like its present brightness (4·21 Harvard) in the tenth century\r\nit seems difficult to explain how it could have escaped Al-Sufi's careful\r\nscrutiny of the heavens, unless it is variable. Its colour seems reddish\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nMr. W. T. Lynn has shown--and I think conclusively--that the so-called\r\n\"new star\" of A.D. 389 (which is said to have appeared near Altair in the\r\nEagle) was really a comet.[335]\r\n\r\nNear the place of Tycho Brahé's great new star of 1572 (the \"Pilgrim\r\nStar\"), Hind and W. E. Plummer observed a small star (No. 129 of\r\nd'Arrest's catalogue of the region) which seemed to show small\r\nfluctuations of light, which \"scarcely include a whole magnitude.\" This\r\nmay possibly be identical with Tycho Brahé's wonderful star, and should be\r\nwatched by observers. The place of this small star is (for 1865) R.A. 0{h}\r\n17{m} 18{s}, N.P.D. 26° 37'·1. The region was examined by Prof. Burnham in\r\n1890 with the 36-inch telescope of the Lick Observatory. \"None of the\r\nfaint stars near the place presented any peculiarity worthy of remark, but\r\nthree double stars were found.\"[336]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the famous Nova (T) Coronæ--the \"Blaze Star\" of\r\n1866--Prof. Barnard finds from careful comparisons with small stars in its\r\nvicinity that \"the Nova is now essentially of the same brightness it was\r\nbefore the outburst of 1866 ... there seems to be no indication of motion\r\nin the _Nova_.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the cause of \"temporary\" stars, or _novæ_, as they are\r\nnow called by astronomers--the late Prof. H. C. Vogel said--\r\n\r\n    \"A direct collision of two celestial bodies is not regarded by Huggins\r\n    as an admissible explanation of the Nova; a partial collision has\r\n    little probability, and the most that can be admitted is perhaps the\r\n    mutual penetration and admixture of the outer gaseous envelopes of\r\n    the two bodies at the time of their closest approach. A more probable\r\n    explanation is given by an hypothesis which we owe to Klinkerfues, and\r\n    which has more recently been further developed by Wilsing, viz. that\r\n    by the very close passage of two celestial bodies enormous tidal\r\n    disturbances are produced and thereby changes in the brightness of the\r\n    bodies. In the case of the two bodies which form the Nova, it must be\r\n    assumed that these phenomena are displayed in the highest degree of\r\n    development, and that changes of pressure have been produced which\r\n    have caused enormous eruptions from the heated interior of the bodies;\r\n    the eruptions are perhaps accompanied by electrical actions, and are\r\n    comparable with the outbursts in our own sun, although they are on a\r\n    much larger scale.\"[337]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that this hypothesis agrees with the fundamental\r\nassumption of the \"Planetesimal Hypothesis\" advocated by Professors\r\nChamberlin and Moulton (see my _Astronomical Essays_, p. 324).\r\n\r\nThe rush of a comparatively small body through a mass of gaseous matter\r\nseems also a very plausible hypothesis. This idea was originally advanced\r\nby Prof. Seeliger, and independently by Mr. Monck.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the nebula which was observed round the great new star\r\nof 1901--Nova Persei--Prof. Lewis Bell supports the theory of Seeliger,\r\nwhich accounts for the apparent movements of the brightest portions of the\r\nnebula by supposing that the various parts of the highly tenuous matter\r\nwere successively lighted up by the effects of a travelling\r\nelectro-magnetic wavefront, and he shows that this theory agrees well with\r\nthe observed phenomenon.[338] The \"collision theory\" which explained the\r\nsudden outburst of light by the meeting of two dark bodies in space, seems\r\nto be now abandoned by the best astronomers. The rapid cooling down of the\r\nsupposed bodies indicated by the rapid decrease of light is quite\r\ninconsistent with this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe rapid diminution in the light of some of these \"new stars\" is very\r\nremarkable. Thus the new star which suddenly blazed out near the nucleus\r\nof the great nebula in Andromeda in August, 1885, faded down in 5 months\r\nfrom \"the limit of visibility to the naked eye to that of a 26-inch\r\ntelescope\"! A _large_ body could not cool in this way.\r\n\r\nMr. Harold K. Palmer thinks that the \"complete and astonishingly rapid\r\nchanges of spectral type observed in the case of _Nova Cygni_ and _Nova\r\nAurigæ_, and likewise those observed in _Nova Normæ_, _Nova Sagittarii_\r\nand _Nova Persei_, leave little doubt that the masses of these objects are\r\nsmall.\"[339]\r\n\r\nNo less than 3748 variable stars had been discovered up to May, 1907. Of\r\nthese 2909 were found at Harvard Observatory (U.S.A.) chiefly by means of\r\nphotography.[340]\r\n\r\nThe star 14. 1904 Cygni has a period of only 3 hours 14 minutes, which is\r\nthe shortest period known for a variable star.\r\n\r\nA very interesting discovery has recently been made with reference to the\r\nstar [Greek: m] Herculis. It has been long suspected of variable light\r\nwith a period of 35 or 40 days, or perhaps irregular. Frost and Adams now\r\nfind it to be a spectroscopic binary, and further observations at Harvard\r\nObservatory show that it is a variable of the Algol (or perhaps [Greek: b]\r\nLyræ) type. The Algol variation of light was suggested by MM. Baker and\r\nSchlesinger. The period seems to be about 2·05 days.[341]\r\n\r\nThe northern of the two \"pointers\" in the Plough (so called because they\r\nnearly point to the Pole Star) is about the 2nd magnitude, as Al-Sufi\r\nrated it. It was thought to be variable in colour by Klein, Konkoly, and\r\nWeber; and M. Lau has recently found a period of 50 days with a maximum of\r\n\"jaune rougeâtre\" on April 2, 1902.\r\n\r\nThe famous variable star [Greek: ê] Argus did \"not exceed the 8th\r\nmagnitude\" in February, 1907, according to Mr. Tebbutt.[342] This is the\r\nfaintest ever recorded for this wonderful star.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in _Knowledge_ (vol. 5, p. 3, January 4, 1884) that the\r\ntemporary star of 1876 (in the constellation of Cygnus) \"had long been\r\nknown and catalogued as a telescopic star of the 9th magnitude with\r\nnothing to distinguish it from the common herd.\" But this is quite\r\nerroneous. The star was quite unknown before it was discovered by Schmidt\r\nat Athens on November 24 of that year. The remark apparently refers to the\r\n\"Blaze Star\" of 1866 in Corona Borealis, which _was_ known previously as a\r\nstar of about the 9th magnitude before its sudden outburst on May 12 of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nThis \"new star\" of 1866--T Coronæ, as it is now called--was, with the\r\npossible exception of Nova Persei (1901), the only example of a _nova_\r\nwhich was known to astronomers as a small star previous to the great\r\noutburst of light. It is the brightest of the _novæ_ still visible. It was\r\nthe first of these interesting objects to be examined with the\r\nspectroscope. It was observed by Burnham in the years 1904-1906 with the\r\ngreat 40-inch telescope of the Yerkes Observatory (U.S.A.). He found its\r\ncolour white, or only slightly tinged with yellow. In August and\r\nSeptember, 1906, he estimated its magnitude at about 9·3, and \"it would\r\nseem therefore that the Nova is now essentially of the same brightness it\r\nwas before the outburst in 1866.\" It shows no indication of motion.\r\nBurnham found no peculiarity about its telescopic image. A small and very\r\nfaint nebula was found by Burnham a little following (that is east of) the\r\n_nova_.[343]\r\n\r\nThe following details of the great new star of 1572--the \"Pilgrim Star\" of\r\nTycho Brahé--are given by Delambre.[344] In November, 1572, it was\r\nbrighter than Sirius, Vega, and Jupiter, and almost equal to Venus at its\r\nbrightest. During December it resembled Jupiter in brightness. In January,\r\n1573, it was fainter and only a little brighter than stars of the 1st\r\nmagnitude. In February and March it was equal to 1st magnitude stars, and\r\nin April and May was reduced to the 2nd magnitude. In June and July it was\r\n3rd magnitude; in September of the 4th, and at the end of 1573 it was\r\nreduced to the 5th magnitude. In February, 1574, it was 6th magnitude, and\r\nin March of the same year it became invisible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nFrom this account it will be seen that the decrease in light of this\r\ncurious object was much slower than that of Nova Persei (1901) (\"the new\r\nstar of the new century\"). This would suggest that it was a much larger\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThere were also changes in its colour. When it was of the brightness of\r\nVenus or Jupiter it shone with a white light. It then became golden, and\r\nafterwards reddish like Mars, Aldebaran, or Betelgeuse. It afterwards\r\nbecame of a livid white colour like Saturn, and this it retained as long\r\nas it was visible. Tycho Brahé thought that its apparent diameter might\r\nhave been about 3-1/2 minutes of arc, and that it was possibly 361 times\r\nsmaller than the earth(!) But we now know that these estimates were\r\nprobably quite erroneous.\r\n\r\nTemporary stars were called by the ancient Chinese \"Ke-sing,\" or guest\r\nstars.[345]\r\n\r\nA temporary star recorded by Ma-tuan-lin (Chinese Annals) in February,\r\n1578, is described as \"a star as large as the sun.\" But its position is\r\nnot given.[346]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of September, 1878, Mr. Greely, of Boston (U.S.A.),\r\nreported to Mr. E. F. Sawyer (the eminent observer of variable stars)\r\nthat, about the middle of August of that year, he had seen the famous\r\nvariable star Mira Ceti of about the 2nd magnitude, although the star did\r\nnot attain its usual maximum until early in October, 1878. Mr. Greely\r\nstated that several nights after he first saw Mira it had faded to the 4th\r\nor 5th magnitude. If there was no mistake in this observation (and Sawyer\r\ncould find none) it was quite an unique phenomenon, as nothing of the sort\r\nhas been observed before or since in the history of this famous star. It\r\nlooks as if Mr. Greely had observed a new or \"temporary\" star near the\r\nplace of Mira Ceti; but as the spot is far from the Milky Way, which is\r\nthe usual seat of such phenomena, this hypothesis seems improbable.\r\n\r\nIn the so-called Cepheid and Geminid variables of short period, the\r\nprincipal characteristics of the light variation are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"1. The light varies without pause.\r\n\r\n    \"2. The amount of their light variation is usually about 1 magnitude.\r\n\r\n    \"3. Their periods are short--a few days only.\r\n\r\n    \"4. They are of a spectral type approximately solar; no Orion, Sirian\r\n    or Arcturian stars having been found among them.\r\n\r\n    \"5. They seem to be found in greater numbers in certain parts of the\r\n    sky, notably in the Milky Way, but exhibit no tendency to form\r\n    clusters.\r\n\r\n    \"6. All those stars whose radial velocities have been studied have\r\n    been found to be binaries whose period of orbital revolution coincides\r\n    with that of their light change.\r\n\r\n    \"7. The orbits, so far as determined, are all small, _a_ sin _i_ being\r\n    2,000,000 kilometres or less.\r\n\r\n    \"8. Their maximum light synchronizes with their maximum velocity of\r\n    approach, and minimum light with maximum velocity of recession.\r\n\r\n    \"9. No case has been found in which the spectrum of more than one\r\n    component has been bright enough to be recorded in the\r\n    spectrograms.\"[347]\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to find an hypothesis which will explain\r\nsatisfactorily _all_ these characteristics, and attempts in this direction\r\nhave not proved very successful. Mr. J. C. Duncan suggests the action of\r\nan absorbing atmosphere surrounding the component stars.\r\n\r\nOn March 30, 1612, Scheiner saw a star near Jupiter. It was at first equal\r\nin brightness to Jupiter's satellites. It gradually faded, and on April 8\r\nof the same year it was only seen with much difficulty in a very clear\r\nsky. \"After that date it was never seen again, although carefully looked\r\nfor under favourable conditions.\"\r\n\r\nAn attempted identification of Scheiner's star was made in recent years by\r\nWinnecke. He found that its position, as indicated by Scheiner, agrees\r\nwith that of the Bonn _Durchmusterung_ star 15°, 2083 (8-1/2 magnitude).\r\nThis star is not a known variable. Winnecke watched it for 17 years, but\r\nfound no variation of light. From Scheiner's recorded observations his\r\nstar seems to have reached the 6th magnitude, which is considerably\r\nbrighter than the _Durchmusterung_ star watched by Winnecke.[348]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the colours of the stars, the supposed change of colour\r\nin Sirius from red to white is well known, and will be considered in the\r\nchapter on the Constellations. The bright star Arcturus has also been\r\nsuspected of variation in colour. About the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury Dr. Julius Schmidt, of Athens, the well-known observer of variable\r\nstars, thought it one of the reddest stars in the sky, especially in the\r\nyear 1841, when he found its colour comparable with that of the planet\r\nMars.[349] In 1852, however, he was surprised to find it yellow and devoid\r\nof any reddish tinge; in colour it was lighter than that of Capella. In\r\n1863, Mr. Jacob Ennis found it \"decidedly orange.\" Ptolemy and Al-Sufi\r\ncalled it red.\r\n\r\nMr. Ennis speaks of Capella as \"blue\" (classing it with Rigel), and\r\ncomparing its colour with that of Vega![350] But the present writer has\r\nnever seen it of this colour. To his eye it seems yellowish or orange. It\r\nwas called red by Ptolemy, El Fergani, and Riccioli; but Al-Sufi says\r\nnothing about its colour.\r\n\r\nOf [Greek: b] Ursæ Minoris, Heis, the eminent German astronomer said, \"I\r\nhave had frequent opportunities of convincing myself that the colour of\r\nthis star is not always equally red; at times it is more or less yellow,\r\nat others most decidedly red.\"[351]\r\n\r\nAmong double stars there are many cases in which variation of colour has\r\nbeen suspected. In some of these the difference in the recorded colour may\r\npossibly be due to \"colour blindness\" in some of the observers; but in\r\nothers there seems to be good evidence in favour of a change. The\r\nfollowing may be mentioned:--\r\n\r\n[Greek: ê] Cassiopeiæ. Magnitudes of the components about 4 and 7-1/2.\r\nRecorded as red and green by Sir John Herschel and South; but yellow and\r\norange by Sestini.\r\n\r\n[Greek: i] Trianguli. Magnitudes 5-1/2 and 7. Secchi estimated them as\r\nwhite or yellow and blue; but Webb called them yellow and green (1862).\r\n\r\n[Greek: g] Leonis, 2 and 3-1/2. Sir William Herschel noted them white and\r\nreddish white; but Webb, light orange and greenish yellow.\r\n\r\n12 Canum Venaticorum, 2-1/2 and 6-1/2. White and red, Sir William\r\nHerschel; but Sir John Herschel says in 1830, \"With all attention I could\r\nperceive no contrast of colours in the two stars.\" Struve found them both\r\nwhite in 1830, thus agreeing with Sir John Herschel. Sestini saw them\r\nyellow and blue in 1844; Smyth, in 1855, pale reddish white and lilac;\r\nDembowski, in 1856, white and pale olive blue; and Webb, in 1862, flushed\r\nwhite and pale lilac.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 1907, Nova Persei, the great new star of 1901, was\r\nestimated to be only 11·44 magnitude, or about 11-1/2. When at its\r\nbrightest this famous star was about zero magnitude; so that it has in\r\nabout 6 years faded about 11-1/2 magnitudes in brightness; in other words,\r\nit has been reduced to 1/40000 of its greatest brilliancy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nNebulæ and Clusters\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his interesting and valuable work on \"The Stars,\" the late Prof.\r\nNewcomb said--\r\n\r\n    \"Great numbers of the nebulæ are therefore thousands of times the\r\n    dimensions of the earth's orbit, and most of them are thousands of\r\n    times the dimensions of the whole solar system. That they should be\r\n    completely transparent through such enormous dimensions shows their\r\n    extreme tenuity. Were our solar system placed in the midst of one of\r\n    them it is probable that we should not be able to find any evidence of\r\n    its existence\"!\r\n\r\nProf. Perrine thinks that the total number of the nebulæ will ultimately\r\nbe found to exceed a million.[352]\r\n\r\nDr. Max Wolf has discovered a number of small nebulæ in the regions near\r\nAlgol and Nova Persei (the great \"new star\" of 1901). He says, \"They\r\nmostly lie in two bands,\" and are especially numerous where the two bands\r\nmeet, a region of 12 minutes of arc square containing no less than 148 of\r\nthem. They are usually \"round with central condensation,\" and form of\r\nAndromeda nebula.[353]\r\n\r\nSome small nebulæ have been found in the vicinity of the globular\r\nclusters. They are described by Prof. Perrine as very small and like an\r\n\"out of focus\" image of a small star. \"They appear to be most numerous\r\nabout clusters which are farthest from the galaxy.\" Prof. Perrine says,\r\n\"Practically all the small nebulæ about the globular clusters are\r\nelliptical or circular. Those large enough to show structure are spirals.\r\nDoubtless the majority of these are spirals.\"[354] This seems further\r\nevidence in favour of the \"spiral nebular hypothesis\" of Chamberlin and\r\nMoulton.\r\n\r\nA great photographic nebula in Orion was discovered by Prof. Barnard in\r\n1894. In a drawing he gives of the nebula,[355] it forms a long streak\r\nbeginning a little south of [Greek: g] Orionis (Bellatrix), passing\r\nthrough the star 38 Orionis north of 51 and south of 56 and 60 Orionis.\r\nThen turning south it sweeps round a little north of [Greek: k] Orionis;\r\nthen over 29 Orionis, and ends a little to the west of [Greek: ê] Orionis.\r\nThere is an outside patch west of Rigel. Barnard thinks that the whole\r\nforms a vast spiral structure; probably connected with the \"great nebula\"\r\nin the \"sword of Orion,\" which it surrounds.\r\n\r\nFrom calculations of the brightness of surface (\"intrinsic brightness\") of\r\nseveral \"planetary\" nebulæ made by the present writer in the year 1905, he\r\nfinds that the luminosity is very small compared with that of the moon.\r\nThe brightest of those examined (_h_ 3365, in the southern hemisphere,\r\nnear the Southern Cross) has a surface luminosity of only 1/400 of that of\r\nthe moon.[356] The great nebulæ in Orion and Andromeda seem to have \"still\r\nsmaller intrinsic brightness.\"\r\n\r\nArago says--\r\n\r\n    \"The spaces which precede or which follow simple nebulæ, and _a\r\n    fortiori_ groups of nebulæ, contain generally few stars. Herschel\r\n    found this rule to be invariable. Thus every time that, during a short\r\n    interval, no star appeared, in virtue of the diurnal motion, to place\r\n    itself in the field of his motionless telescope, he was accustomed to\r\n    say to the secretary who assisted him (Miss Caroline Herschel),\r\n    'Prepare to write; nebulæ are about to arrive.'\"[357]\r\n\r\nCommenting on this remark of Arago, the late Herbert Spencer says--\r\n\r\n    \"How does this fact consist with the hypothesis that nebulæ are remote\r\n    galaxies? If there were but one nebula, it would be a curious\r\n    coincidence were this one nebula so placed in the distant regions of\r\n    space as to agree in direction with a starless spot in our sidereal\r\n    system! If there were but two nebulæ, and both were so placed, the\r\n    coincidence would be excessively strange. What shall we say on\r\n    finding that they are habitually so placed? (the last five words\r\n    replace some that are possibly a little too strong).... When to the\r\n    fact that the general mass of nebulæ are antithetical in position to\r\n    the general mass of the stars, we add the fact that local regions of\r\n    nebulæ are regions where stars are scarce, and the further fact that\r\n    single nebulæ are habitually found in comparatively starless spots,\r\n    does not the proof of a physical connection become overwhelming?\"[358]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the small elongated nebula discovered by Miss Caroline\r\nHerschel in 1783 near the great nebula in Andromeda, Admiral Smyth says,\r\n\"It lies between two sets of stars, consisting of four each, and each\r\ndisposed like the figure 7, the preceding group being the smallest.\"[359]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the \"nebula\" Messier 3--a globular cluster in Canes\r\nVenatici--Admiral Smyth says, \"This mass is one of those balls of compact\r\nand wedged stars whose laws of aggregation it is so impossible to assign;\r\nbut the rotundity of the figure gives full indication of some general\r\nattractive bond of union.\"[360] The terms \"compact and wedged\" are,\r\nhowever, too strong, for we know that in the globular clusters the\r\ncomponent stars must be separated from each other by millions of miles!\r\n\r\nProf. Chamberlin suggests that the secondary nebula (as it is called) in\r\nthe great spiral in Canes Venatici (Messier 51) may possibly represent\r\nthe body which collided with the other (the chief nucleus) in a grazing\r\ncollision, and is now escaping. He considers this secondary body to have\r\nbeen \"a dead sun\"--that is, a dark body.[361] This would be very\r\ninteresting if it could be proved. But it seems to me more probable that\r\nthe secondary nucleus is simply a larger portion of the ejected matter,\r\nwhich is now being gradually detached from the parent mass.\r\n\r\nScheiner says \"the previous suspicion that the spiral nebulæ are star\r\nclusters is now raised to a certainty,\" and that the spectrum of the\r\nAndromeda nebula is very similar to that of the sun. He says there is \"a\r\nsurprising agreement of the two, even in respect to the relative intensity\r\nof the separate spectral regions.\"[362]\r\n\r\nIn the dynamical theory of spiral nebulæ, Dr. E. J. Wilczynski thinks that\r\nthe age of a spiral nebula may be indicated by the number of its coils;\r\nthose having the largest number of coils being the oldest, from the point\r\nof view of evolution.[363] This seems to be very probable.\r\n\r\nIn the spectrum of the gaseous nebulæ, the F line of hydrogen (H[Greek:\r\nb]) is visible, but not the C line (H[Greek: a]). The invisibility of the\r\nC line is explained by Scheiner as due to a physiological cause, \"the eye\r\nbeing less sensitive to that part of the spectrum in which the line\r\nappears than to the part containing the F line.\"[364]\r\n\r\nAn apparent paradox is found in the case of the gaseous nebulæ. The\r\nundefined outlines of these objects render any attempt at measuring their\r\nparallax very difficult, if not impossible. Their distance from the earth\r\nis therefore unknown, and perhaps likely to remain so for many years to\r\ncome. It is possible that they may not be farther from us than some of the\r\nstars visible in their vicinity. On the other hand, they may lie far\r\nbeyond them in space. But whatever their distance from the earth may be,\r\nit may be easily shown that their attraction on the sun is directly\r\nproportioned to their distance--that is, the greater their distance, the\r\ngreater the attraction! This is evidently a paradox, and rather a\r\nstartling one too. But it is nevertheless mathematically true, and can be\r\neasily proved. For, _their distance being unknown_, they may be of any\r\ndimensions. They might be comparatively small bodies relatively near the\r\nearth, or they may be immense masses at a vast distance from us. The\r\nlatter is, of course, the more probable. In either case the _apparent_\r\nsize would be the same. Take the case of any round gaseous nebula.\r\nAssuming it to be of a globular form, its _real_ diameter will depend on\r\nits distance from the earth--the greater the distance, the greater the\r\ndiameter. Now, as the volumes of spheres vary as the cubes of their\r\ndiameters, it follows that the volume of the nebula will vary as the cube\r\nof its distance from the earth. As the mass of an attracting body depends\r\non its volume and density, its real mass will depend on the cube of its\r\ndistance, the density (although unknown) being a fixed quantity. If at a\r\ncertain distance its mass is _m_, at double the distance (the _apparent_\r\ndiameter being the same) it would have a mass of eight times _m_ (8 being\r\nthe cube of 2), and at treble the distance its mass would be 27 _m_, and\r\nso on, its _apparent_ size being known, but not its _real_ size. This is\r\nobvious. Now, the attractive power of a body varies directly as its\r\nmass--the greater the mass, the greater the attraction. Again, the\r\nattraction varies _inversely_ as the square of the distance, according to\r\nthe well-known law of Newton. Hence if _d_ be the unknown distance of the\r\nnebula, we have its attractive power varying as _d_{3} divided by _d_{2},\r\nor directly as the distance _d_. We have then the curious paradox that for\r\na nebula whose distance from the earth is unknown, its attractive power on\r\nthe sun (or earth) will vary directly as the distance--the greater the\r\ndistance the greater the attraction, and, of course, conversely, the\r\nsmaller the distance the less the attractive power. This result seems at\r\nfirst sight absurd and incredible, but a little consideration will show\r\nthat it is quite correct. Consider a small wisp of cloud in our\r\natmosphere. Its mass is almost infinitesimal and its attractive power on\r\nthe earth practically _nil_. But a gaseous nebula having the same\r\n_apparent size_ would have an enormous volume, and, although probably\r\nformed of very tenuous gas, its mass would be very great, and its\r\nattractive power considerable. The large apparent size of the Orion nebula\r\nshows that its volume is probably enormous, and as its attraction on the\r\nsun is not appreciable, its density must be excessively small, less than\r\nthe density of the air remaining in the receiver of the best air-pump\r\nafter the air has been exhausted. How such a tenuous gas can shine as it\r\ndoes forms another paradox. Its light is possibly due to some\r\nphosphorescent or electrical action.\r\n\r\nThe apparent size of \"the great nebula in Andromeda\" shows that it must be\r\nan object of vast dimensions. The nearest star to the earth, Alpha\r\nCentauri, although probably equal to our sun in volume, certainly does not\r\nexceed one-hundredth of a second in diameter as seen from the earth. But\r\nin the case of the Andromeda nebula we have an object of considerable\r\napparent size, not measured by seconds of arc, but showing an area about\r\nthree times greater than that of the full moon. The nebula certainly lies\r\nin the region of the stars--much farther off than Alpha Centauri--and its\r\ngreat apparent size shows that it must be of stupendous dimensions. A\r\nmoment's consideration will show that whatever its distance may be, the\r\nfarther it is from the earth the larger it must be in actual size. The sun\r\nis vastly larger than the moon, but its apparent size is about the same\r\nowing to its greater distance. Sir William Herschel thought the Andromeda\r\nnebula to be \"undoubtedly the nearest of all the great nebulæ,\" and he\r\nestimated its distance at 2000 times the distance of Sirius. This would\r\nnot, however, indicate a relatively near object, as it would imply a\r\n\"light journey\" of over 17,000 years! (The distance of Sirius is about 88\r\n\"light years.\")\r\n\r\nIt has been generally supposed that this great nebula lies at a vast\r\ndistance from the earth, possibly far beyond most of the stars seen in the\r\nsame region of the sky; but perhaps not quite so far as Herschel's\r\nestimate would imply. Recently, however, Prof. Bohlin of Stockholm has\r\nfound from three series of measures made in recent years a parallax of\r\n0\"·17.[365]\r\n\r\nThis indicates a distance of 1,213,330 times the sun's distance from the\r\nearth, and a \"light journey\" of about 19 years. This would make the\r\ndistance of the nebula more than twice the distance of Sirius, about four\r\ntimes the distance of [Greek: a] Centauri, but less than that of Capella.\r\n\r\nProf. Bohlin's result is rather unexpected, and will require confirmation\r\nbefore it can be accepted. But it will be interesting to inquire what this\r\nparallax implies as to the real dimensions and probable mass of this vast\r\nnebula. The extreme length of the nebula may be taken to represent its\r\ndiameter considered as circular. For, although a circle seen obliquely is\r\nalways foreshortened into an ellipse, still the longer axis of the ellipse\r\nwill always represent the real diameter of the circle. This may be seen by\r\nholding a penny at various angles to the eye. Now, Dr. Roberts found that\r\nthe apparent length of the Andromeda nebula is 2-1/3 degrees, or 8400\r\nseconds of arc. The diameter in seconds divided by the parallax will give\r\nthe real diameter of the nebula in terms of the sun's distance from the\r\nearth taken as unity. Now, 8400 divided by 0\"·17 gives nearly 50,000, that\r\nis, the real diameter of the Andromeda nebula would be--on Bohlin's\r\nparallax--nearly 50,000 times the sun's distance from the earth. As light\r\ntakes about 500 seconds to come from the sun to the earth, the above\r\nfigures imply that light would take about 290 days, or over 9 months to\r\ncross the diameter of this vast nebula.\r\n\r\nElementary geometrical considerations will show that if the Andromeda\r\nnebula lies at a greater distance from the earth than that indicated by\r\nBohlin's parallax, its real diameter, and therefore its volume and mass,\r\nwill be greater. If, therefore, we assume the parallax found by Bohlin,\r\nwe shall probably find a _minimum_ value for the size and mass of this\r\nmarvellous object.\r\n\r\nAmong Dr. Roberts' photographs of spiral nebulæ (and the Andromeda nebula\r\nis undoubtedly a spiral) there are some which are apparently seen nearly\r\nedgeways, and show that these nebulæ are very thin in proportion to their\r\ndiameter. From a consideration of these photographs we may, I think,\r\nassume a thickness of about one-hundredth of the diameter. This would give\r\na thickness for the Andromeda nebulæ of about 500 times the sun's distance\r\nfrom the earth. This great thickness will give some idea of the vast\r\nproportions of the object we are dealing with. The size of the whole solar\r\nsystem--large as it is--is small in comparison. The diameter and thickness\r\nfound above can easily be converted into miles, and from these dimensions\r\nthe actual volume of the nebula can be compared with that of the sun. It\r\nis merely a question of simple mensuration, and no problem of \"high\r\nmathematics\" is involved. Making the necessary calculations, I find that\r\nthe volume of the Andromeda nebula would be about 2·32 trillion times\r\n(2·32 × 10{18}) the sun's volume! Now, assuming that the nebulous matter\r\nfills only one-half of the apparent volume of the nebula (allowing for\r\nspaces between the spiral branches), we have the volume = 1·16 × 10{18}.\r\nIf the nebula had the same density as the sun, this would be its mass in\r\nterms of the sun's mass taken as unity, a mass probably exceeding the\r\ncombined mass of all the _stars_ visible in the largest telescopes! But\r\nthis assumption is, of course, inadmissible, as the sun is evidently quite\r\nopaque, whereas the nebula is, partially at least, more or less\r\ntransparent. Let us suppose that the nebula has a _mean_ density equal to\r\nthat of atmospheric air. As water is about 773 times heavier than air, and\r\nthe sun's density is 1·4 (water = 1) we have the mass of the nebula equal\r\nto 1·16 × 10{18} divided by 773 × 1·4, or about 10{15} times the sun's\r\nmass, which is still much greater than the probable combined mass of all\r\nthe _visible_ stars. As it seems unreasonable to suppose that the mass of\r\nan individual member of our sidereal system should exceed the combined\r\nmass of the remainder of the system, we seem compelled to further reduce\r\nthe density of the Andromeda nebula. Let us assume a mean density of, say,\r\na millionth of hydrogen gas (a sufficiently low estimate) which is about\r\n14·44 times lighter than air, and we obtain a mass of about 8 × 10{7} or\r\n80 million times the mass of the sun, which is still an enormous mass.\r\n\r\nAs possibly I may have assumed too great a thickness for the nebula, let\r\nus take a thickness of one-tenth of that used above, or one thousandth of\r\nthe length of the nebula. This gives a mass of 8 million times the sun's\r\nmass. This seems a more probable mass if the nebula is--as Bohlin's\r\nparallax implies--a member of our sidereal system.\r\n\r\nIf we assume a parallax of say 0\"·01--or one-hundredth of a second of\r\narc--which would still keep the nebula within the bounds of our sidereal\r\nsystem--we have the dimensions of the nebula increased 17 times, and hence\r\nits mass nearly 5000 times greater (17{3}) than that found above. The mass\r\nwould then be 40,000 million times the sun's mass! This result seems\r\nhighly improbable, for even this small parallax would imply a light\r\njourney of only 326 years, whereas the distance of the Milky Way has been\r\nestimated by Prof. Newcomb at about 3000 years' journey for light.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Roberts' photograph many small stars are seen scattered over the\r\nsurface of the nebula; but these do not seem to be quite so numerous as in\r\nthe surrounding sky. If the nebula lies nearer to us than the fainter\r\nstars visible on the photograph, some of them may be obscured by the\r\ndenser portions of the nebula; some may be visible through the openings\r\nbetween the spiral branches; while others may be nearer to us and simply\r\nprojected on the nebula.\r\n\r\nTo add to the difficulty of solving this celestial problem, the\r\nspectroscope shows that the Andromeda nebula is not gaseous. The spectrum\r\nis, according to Scheiner, very similar to that of the sun, and \"there is\r\na surprising agreement of the two, even in respect to the relative\r\nintensities of the separate spectral regions.\"[366] He thinks that \"the\r\ngreater part of the stars comprising the nucleus of the nebula belong to\r\nthe second spectral class\" (solar), and that the nebula \"is now in an\r\nadvanced stage of development. No trace of bright nebular lines are\r\npresent, so that the interstellar space in the Andromeda nebula, just as\r\nin our stellar system, is not appreciably occupied by gaseous\r\nmatter.\"[366] He suggests that the inner part of the nebula [the\r\n\"nucleus\"] \"corresponds to the complex of those stars which do not belong\r\nto the Milky Way, while the latter corresponds to the spirals of the\r\nAndromeda nebula.\"[366] On this view of the matter we may suppose that the\r\ncomponent particles are small bodies widely separated, and in this way the\r\n_mean_ density of the Andromeda nebula may be very small indeed. They\r\ncannot be large bodies, as the largest telescopes have failed to resolve\r\nthe nebula into stars, and photographs show no sign of resolution.\r\n\r\nIt has often been suggested, and sometimes definitely stated, that the\r\nAndromeda nebula may possibly be an \"external\" universe, that is an\r\nuniverse entirely outside our sidereal system, and comparable with it in\r\nsize. Let us examine the probability of such hypothesis. Assuming that the\r\nnebula has the same diameter as the Milky Way, or about 6000 \"light\r\nyears,\" as estimated by Prof. Newcomb, I find that its distance from the\r\nearth would be about 150,000 \"light years.\" As this is about 8000 times\r\nthe distance indicated by Bohlin's parallax, its dimensions would be 8000\r\ntimes as great, and hence its volume and mass would be 8000 cubed, or\r\n512,000,000,000 times greater than that found above. That is, about 4\r\ntrillion (4 × 10{18}) times the sun's mass! As this appears an incredibly\r\nlarge mass to be compressed into a volume even so large as that of our\r\nsidereal system, we seem compelled to reject the hypothesis that the\r\nnebula represents an external universe. The sun placed at the distance\r\ncorresponding to 150,000 light years would, I find, shine as a star of\r\nless than the 23rd magnitude, a magnitude which would be invisible in the\r\nlargest telescope that man could ever construct. But the combined light of\r\n4 trillion of stars of even the 23rd magnitude would be equal to one of\r\nminus 23·5 magnitude, that is, 23-1/2 magnitude brighter than the zero\r\nmagnitude, or not very much inferior to the sun in brightness. As the\r\nAndromeda nebula shines only as a star of about the 5th magnitude the\r\nhypothesis of an external universe seems to be untenable.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the mass of the Andromeda nebula must be\r\nenormous; and if it belongs to our sidereal system, and if the other great\r\nnebulæ have similar masses, it seems quite possible that the mass of the\r\n_visible_ universe may much exceed that of the _visible_ stars, and may be\r\nequal to 1000 million times the sun's mass--as supposed by the late Lord\r\nKelvin--or even much more.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the small star which suddenly blazed out near the\r\nnucleus of the Andromeda nebula in August, 1885, Prof. Seeliger has\r\ninvestigated the decrease in the light of the star on the hypothesis that\r\nit was a cooling body which had suddenly been raised to an intense heat by\r\nthe shock of a collision, and finds a fair agreement between theory and\r\nobservation. Prof. Auwers points out the similarity between this outburst\r\nand that of the \"temporary star\" of 1860, which appeared in the cluster 80\r\nMessier, and he thinks it very probable that both phenomena were due to\r\nphysical changes in the nebulæ in which they appeared.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this temporary star in the Andromeda nebula seems to\r\nafford further evidence against the hypothesis of the nebula being an\r\nexternal universe. For, as I have shown above, our sun, if placed at a\r\ndistance of 150,000 light years, would shine only as a star of the 23rd\r\nmagnitude, or over 15 magnitudes fainter than the temporary star. This\r\nwould imply that the star shone with a brightness of over a million times\r\nthat of the sun, and would therefore indicate a body of enormous size. But\r\nthe rapid fading of its light would, on the contrary, imply a body of\r\ncomparatively small dimensions. We must, therefore, conclude that the\r\nnebula, whatever it may be, is not an external universe, but forms a\r\nmember of our own sidereal system.\r\n\r\nIn Sir John Herschel's catalogue of Nebulæ and Clusters of Stars,\r\npublished in 1833, in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal\r\nSociety, there are many curious objects mentioned. Of these I have\r\nselected the following:--\r\n\r\nNo. 496 is described as \"a superb cluster which fills the whole field;\r\nstars 9, 10 ... 13 magnitude and none below, but the whole ground of the\r\nsky on which it stands is singularly dotted over with infinitely minute\r\npoints.\" This is No. 22 of Sir William Herschel's 6th class, and will be\r\nfound about 3 degrees south and a little east of the triple star 29\r\nMonocerotis.\r\n\r\nNo. 650. This object lies about 3 degrees north of the star [Greek: m]\r\nLeonis, the most northern of the bright stars in the well-known \"Sickle,\"\r\nand is thus described by Sir John Herschel: \"A star 12th magnitude with an\r\nextremely faint nebulous atmosphere about 10\" to 12\". It is between a star\r\n8-9 magnitude north preceding, and one 10th magnitude south following,\r\nneither of which are so affected. A curious object.\"\r\n\r\nNo. 1558. Messier 53. A little north-east of the star [Greek: a] Comæ\r\nBerenices. Described as \"a most beautiful highly compressed cluster.\r\nStars very small, 12th ... 20th magnitude, with scattered stars to a\r\nconsiderable distance; irregularly round, but not globular. Comes up to a\r\nblaze in the centre; indicating a round mass of pretty equable density.\r\nExtremely compressed. A most beautiful object. A mass of close-wedged\r\nstars 5' in diameter; a few 12th magnitude, the rest of the smallest size\r\nand innumerable.\" Webb says, \"Not very bright with 3-7/10 inches;\r\nbeautiful with 9 inches.\" This should be a magnificent object with a very\r\nlarge telescope, like the Lick or Yerkes.\r\n\r\nNo. 2018. \"A more than usually condensed portion of the enormous cluster\r\nof the Milky Way. The field has 200 or 300 stars in it at once.\" This lies\r\nabout 2° south-west of the star 6 Aquilæ, which is near the northern edge\r\nof the bright spot of Milky Way light in \"Sobieski's Shield\"--one of the\r\nbrightest spots in the sky.\r\n\r\nNo. 2093. \"A most wonderful phenomenon. A very large space 20' or 30'\r\nbroad in Polar Distance, and 1{m} or 2{m} in Right Ascension, full of\r\nnebula and stars mixed. The nebula is decidedly attached to the stars, and\r\nis as decidedly not stellar. It forms irregular lace-work marked out by\r\nstars, but some parts are decidedly nebulous, wherein no star can be\r\nseen.\" Sir John Herschel gives a figure of this curious spot, which he\r\nsays represents its \"general character, but not the minute details of\r\nthis object, which would be extremely difficult to give with any degree of\r\nfidelity.\" It lies about 3 degrees west of the bright star [Greek: z]\r\nCygni.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous curious objects observed by Sir John Herschel during\r\nhis visit to the Cape of Good Hope, the following may be mentioned:--\r\n\r\n_h_ 2534 (H iv. 77). Near [Greek: t]{4} Eridani. Sir John Herschel says,\r\n\"Attached cometically to a 9th magnitude star which forms its head. It is\r\nan exact resemblance to Halley's comet as seen in a night glass.\"... \"A\r\ncomplete telescopic comet; a perfect miniature of Halley's comet, only the\r\ntail is rather broader in proportion.\"[367]\r\n\r\n_h_ 3075. Between [Greek: g] Monocerotis and [Greek: g] Canis Majoris. \"A\r\nvery singular nebula, and much like the profile of a bust (head, neck, and\r\nshoulders) or a silhouette portrait, very large, pretty well defined,\r\nlight nearly uniform, about 12' diameter. In a crowded field of Milky Way\r\nstars, many of which are projected on it.\"[368]\r\n\r\n_h_ 3315 (Dunlop 323). In the Milky Way; about 3° east of the Eta Argûs\r\nnebula. Sir John Herschel says, \"A glorious cluster of immense magnitude,\r\nbeing at least 2 fields in extent every way. The stars are 8, 9, 10, and\r\n11th magnitudes, but chiefly 10th magnitude, of which there must be at\r\nleast 200. It is the most brilliant object of the kind I have ever seen\"\r\n... \"has several elegant double stars, and many orange-coloured\r\nstars.\"[369] This should form a fine object in even a comparatively small\r\ntelescope, and may be recommended to observers in the southern hemisphere.\r\nA telescope of 3-inches aperture should show it well.\r\n\r\nAmong astronomical curiosities may be counted \"clusters within clusters.\"\r\nA cluster in Gemini (N.G.C. 2331) has a small group of \"six or seven stars\r\nclose together and well isolated from the rest.\"\r\n\r\nLord Rosse describes No. 4511 of Sir John Herschel's General Catalogue of\r\nNebulæ and Clusters (_Phil. Trans._, 1864) as \"a most gorgeous cluster,\r\nstars 12-15 magnitude, full of holes.\"[370] His sketch of this cluster\r\nshows 3 rings of stars in a line, each ring touching the next on the\r\noutside. Sir John Herschel described it as \"Cluster; very large; very\r\nrich; stars 11-15 magnitude (Harding, 1827),\" but says nothing about the\r\nrings. This cluster lies about 5 degrees south of [Greek: d] Cygni.\r\n\r\nDr. See, observing with the large telescope of the Lowell Observatory,\r\nfound that when the sky is clear, the moon absent, and the seeing perfect,\r\n\"the sky appeared in patches to be of a brownish colour,\" and suggests\r\nthat this colour owes its existence to immense cosmical clouds, which are\r\nshining by excessively feeble light! Dr. See found that these brown\r\npatches seem to cluster in certain regions of the Milky Way.[371]\r\n\r\nFrom a comparison of Trouvelot's drawing of the small elongated nebula\r\nnear the great nebula in Andromeda with recent photographs, Mr. Easton\r\ninfers that this small nebula has probably rotated through an angle of\r\nabout 15° in 25 years. An examination I have made of photographs taken in\r\ndifferent years seems to me to confirm this suspicion, which, if true, is\r\nevidently a most interesting phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDr. Max Wolf of Heidelberg finds, by spectrum photography, that the\r\nwell-known \"ring nebula\" in Lyra consists of four rings composed of four\r\ndifferent gases. Calling the inner ring A, the next B, the next C, and the\r\nouter D, he finds that A is the smallest ring, and is composed of an\r\nunknown gas; the next largest, B, is composed of hydrogen gas; the next,\r\nC, consists of helium gas; and the outer and largest ring, D, is\r\ncomposed--like A--of an unknown gas. As the molecular weight of hydrogen\r\nis 2·016, and that of helium is 3·96, Prof. Bohuslav Brauner suggests that\r\nthe molecular weight of the gas composing the inner ring A is smaller than\r\nthat of hydrogen, and the molecular weight of the gas forming the outer\r\nring D is greater than that of helium. He also suggests that the gas of\r\nring A may possibly be identical with the \"coronium\" of the solar corona,\r\nfor which Mendelief found a hypothetical atomic and molecular weight of\r\n0·4.[372]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the nebular hypothesis of Laplace, Dr. A. R. Wallace\r\nargues that \"if there exists a sun in a state of expansion in which our\r\nsun was when it extended to the orbit of Neptune, it would, even with a\r\nparallax of 1/60th of a second, show a disc of half a second, which could\r\nbe seen with the Lick telescope.\" My reply to this objection is, that with\r\nsuch an expansion there would probably be very little \"intrinsic\r\nbrightness,\" and if luminous enough to be visible the spectrum would be\r\nthat of a gaseous nebula, and no known _star_ gives such a spectrum. But\r\nsome planetary nebulæ look like small stars, and with high powers on large\r\ntelescopes would probably show a disc. On these considerations, Dr.\r\nWallace's objection does not seem to be valid.\r\n\r\nIt is usually stated in popular works on astronomy that the spectra of\r\ngaseous nebulæ show only three or four bright lines on a faint continuous\r\nbackground. But this is quite incorrect. No less than forty bright lines\r\nhave been seen and measured in the spectra of gaseous nebulæ.[373] This\r\nincludes 2 lines of \"nebulium,\" 11 of hydrogen, 5 of helium, 1 of oxygen\r\n(?), 3 of nitrogen (?), 1 of silicon (?), and 17 of an unknown substance.\r\nIn the great nebulæ in Orion 30 bright lines have been photographed.[374]\r\n\r\nD'Arrest found that \"gaseous nebulæ are rarely met with outside the Milky\r\nWay, and never at a considerable distance from it.\"[375]\r\n\r\nMr. A. E. Fath thinks that \"no spiral nebula investigated has a truly\r\ncontinuous spectrum.\" He finds that so feeble is the intensity of the\r\nlight of the spiral nebulæ that, while a spectrogram of Arcturus can be\r\nsecured with the Mills spectrograph \"in less than two minutes,\" \"an\r\nexposure of about 500 hours would be required for the great nebula in\r\nAndromeda, which is of the same spectral type.\"[376] Mr. Fath thinks that\r\nin the case of the Andromeda nebula, the \"star cluster\" theory \"seems to\r\nbe the only one that can at all adequately explain the spectrum\r\nobtained.\"[377]\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard finds that the great cluster in Hercules (Messier 13) is\r\n\"composed of stars of different spectral types.\" This result was confirmed\r\nby Mr. Fath.[378]\r\n\r\nFrom observations with the great 40-inch telescope of the Yerkes\r\nObservatory (U.S.A.), Prof. Barnard finds that the nucleus of the\r\nplanetary nebula H. iv. 18 in Andromeda is variable to the extent of at\r\nleast 3 magnitudes. At its brightest it is about the 12th magnitude; and\r\nthe period seems to be about 28 days. Barnard says, \"I think this is the\r\nfirst case in which the nucleus of a planetary or other nebula has been\r\nshown to be certainly variable.\" \"The normal condition seems to be\r\nfaint--the nucleus remaining bright for a few days only. In an ordinary\r\ntelescope it looks like a small round disc of a bluish green colour.\" He\r\nestimated the brightness of the nebula as that of a star of 8·2\r\nmagnitude.[379] Even in a telescope of 4 inches aperture, this would be a\r\nfairly bright object. It lies about 3-1/2 degrees south-west of the star\r\n[Greek: i] Andromedæ.\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"globular clusters\" usually include stars of different\r\nbrightness; comparatively bright telescopic stars of the 10th to 13th\r\nmagnitude with faint stars of the 15th to 17th magnitude. Prof. Perrine of\r\nthe Lick Observatory finds that (_a_) \"the division of the stars in\r\nglobular clusters into groups, differing widely in brightness, is\r\ncharacteristic of these objects\"; (_b_) \"the globular clusters are devoid\r\nof true nebulosity\"; and (_c_) \"stars fainter than 15th magnitude\r\npredominate in the Milky Way and globular clusters, but elsewhere are\r\nrelatively scarce.\" He found that \"exposures of one hour or thereabouts\r\nshowed as many stars as exposures four to six times as long; the only\r\neffect of the longer exposures being in the matter of density.\" This last\r\nresult confirms the late Dr. Roberts' conclusions. Perrine finds that for\r\nclusters in the Milky Way, the faint stars (15th to 17th magnitude) \"are\r\nabout as numerous in proportion to the bright stars (10th to 13th\r\nmagnitude) as in the globular clusters themselves.\" This is, however, not\r\nthe case with globular clusters at a distance from the Milky Way. In these\r\nlatter clusters he found that \"in the regions outside the limits of the\r\ncluster there are usually very few faint stars, hardly more than\r\none-fourth or one-tenth as many as there are bright stars\"; and he thinks\r\nthat \"this paucity of faint stars\" in the vicinity of these clusters\r\n\"gives rise to the suspicion that all regions at a distance from the\r\nGalaxy may be almost devoid of these very faint stars.\" The late Prof.\r\nKeeler's series of nebular photographs \"in or near the Milky Way\" tend to\r\nconfirm the above conclusions. Perrine finds the northernmost region of\r\nthe Milky Way \"to be almost, if not entirely, devoid of globular\r\nclusters.\"[380]\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir John Herschel, \"the sublimity of the spectacle afforded\"\r\nby Lord Rosse's great telescope of 6 feet in diameter of some of the\r\n\"larger globular and other clusters\" \"is declared by all who have\r\nwitnessed it, to be such that no words can express.\"[381]\r\n\r\nIn his address to the British Association at Leicester in 1907, Sir David\r\nGill said--\r\n\r\n    \"Evidence upon evidence has accumulated to show that nebulæ consist of\r\n    the matter out of which stars have been and are being evolved.... The\r\n    fact of such an evolution with the evidence before us, can hardly be\r\n    doubted. I most fully believe that, when the modifications of\r\n    terrestrial spectra under sufficiently varied conditions of\r\n    temperature, pressure, and environment, have been further studied,\r\n    this connection will be greatly strengthened.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nHistorical\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grouping of the stars into constellations is of great antiquity. The\r\nexact date of their formation is not exactly known, but an approximate\r\nresult may be arrived at from the following considerations. On the\r\ncelestial spheres, or \"globes,\" used by the ancient astronomers, a portion\r\nof the southern heavens of a roughly circular form surrounding the South\r\nPole was left blank. This space presumably contained the stars in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere which they could not see from their northern stations.\r\nNow, the centre of this circular blank space most probably coincided with\r\nthe South Pole of the heavens at the time when the constellations were\r\nfirst formed. Owing to the \"Precession of the Equinoxes\" this centre has\r\nnow moved away from the South Pole to a considerable distance. It can be\r\neasily computed at what period this centre coincided with the South Pole,\r\nand calculations show that this was the case about 2700 B.C. The position\r\nof this circle also indicates that the constellations were formed at a\r\nplace between 36° and 40° north latitude, and therefore probably somewhere\r\nin Asia Minor north of Mesopotamia. Again, the most ancient observations\r\nrefer to Taurus as the equinoxial constellation. Virgil says--\r\n\r\n  \"Candidus auratis aperit cum cornibus annum Taurus.\"[382]\r\n\r\nThis would indicate a date about 3000 B.C. There is no tradition, however,\r\nthat the constellation Gemini was ever _seen_ to occupy this position, so\r\nthat 3000 B.C. seems to be the earliest date admissible.[383]\r\n\r\nProf. Sayce thinks that the \"signs of the Zodiac\" had their origin in the\r\nplains of Mesopotamia in the twentieth or twenty-third century B.C., and\r\nBrown gives the probable date as 2084 B.C.[384]\r\n\r\nAccording to Seneca, the study of astronomy among the Greeks dates back to\r\nabout 1400 B.C.; and the ancient constellations were already classical in\r\nthe time of Eudoxus in the fourth century B.C. Eudoxus (408-355 B.C.)\r\nobserved the positions of forty-seven stars visible in Greece, thus\r\nforming the most ancient star catalogue which has been preserved. He was a\r\nson of Eschinus, and a pupil of Archytas and probably Plato.\r\n\r\nThe work of Eudoxus was put into verse by the poet Aratus (third century\r\nB.C.). This poem describes all the old constellations now known, except\r\nLibra, the Balance, which was at that time included in the Claws of the\r\nScorpion. About B.C. 50, the Romans changed the Claws, or Chelæ, into\r\nLibra. Curious to say, Aratus states that the constellation Lyra contained\r\nno bright star![385] Whereas its principal star, Vega, is now one of the\r\nbrightest stars in the heavens!\r\n\r\nWith reference to the origin of the constellations, Aratus says--\r\n\r\n                    \"Some men of yore\r\n  A nomenclature thought of and devised\r\n  And forms sufficient found.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows that even in the time of Aratus the constellations were of\r\ngreat antiquity.\r\n\r\nBrown says--\r\n\r\n    \"Writers have often told us, speaking only from the depths of their\r\n    ignorance, how 'Chaldean' shepherds were wont to gaze at the brilliant\r\n    nocturnal sky, and to _imagine_ that such and such stars resemble this\r\n    or that figure. But all this is merely the old effort to make capital\r\n    out of nescience, and the stars are before our eyes to prove the\r\n    contrary. Having already certain fixed ideas and figures in his mind,\r\n    the constellation-former, when he came to his task, applied his\r\n    figures to the stars and the stars to his figures as harmoniously as\r\n    possible.\"[386] \"Thus _e.g._ he arranged the stars of _Andromeda_ into\r\n    the representation of a chained lady, not because they naturally\r\n    reminded him (or anybody else) of such a figure, but because he\r\n    desired to express that idea.\"\r\n\r\nA coin of Manius Aquillus, B.C. 94, shows four stars in Aquila, and seems\r\nto be the oldest representation extant of a star group. On a coin of B.C.\r\n43, Dr. Vencontre found five stars, one of which was much larger than the\r\nothers, and concludes that it represents the Hyades (in Taurus). He\r\nattributes the coin to P. Clodius Turrinus, who probably used the\r\nconstellation Taurus or Taurinus as a phonetic reference to his surname. A\r\ncoin struck by L. Lucretius Trio in 74 B.C., shows the seven stars of the\r\nPlough, or as the ancients called them Septem Triones. Here we have an\r\nallusion to the name of the magistrate Trio.[387]\r\n\r\nIn a work published in Berne in 1760, Schmidt contends that the ancient\r\nEgyptians gave to the constellations of the Zodiac the names of their\r\ndivinities, and expressed them by the signs which were used in their\r\nhieroglyphics.[388]\r\n\r\nHesiod mentions Orion, the Pleiades, Sirius, Aldebaran, and Arcturus; and\r\nHomer refers to Orion, Arcturus, the Pleiades, the Hyades, the Great Bear\r\n(under the name of Amaxa, the Chariot), and the tail of the Little Bear,\r\nor \"Cynosura.\"\r\n\r\nHipparchus called the constellations Asterisms ([Greek: asterismos]),\r\nAristotle and Hyginus [Greek: Somata] (bodies), and Ptolemy [Greek:\r\nSchêmata] (figures). By some they were called [Greek: Morphôseis]\r\n(configurations), and by others [Greek: Meteôre]. Proclus called those\r\nnear the ecliptic [Greek: Zôdia] (animals). Hence our modern name Zodiac.\r\n\r\nHipparchus, Ptolemy, and Al-Sufi referred the positions of the stars to\r\nthe ecliptic. They are now referred to the equator. Aboul Hassan in the\r\nthirteenth century (1282) was the first to use Right Ascensions and\r\nDeclinations instead of Longitudes and Latitudes. The ancient writers\r\ndescribed the stars by their positions in the ancient figures. Thus they\r\nspoke of \"the star in the head of Hercules,\" \"the bright star in the left\r\nfoot of Orion\" (Rigel); but Bayer in 1603 introduced the Greek letters to\r\ndesignate the brighter stars, and these are now universally used by\r\nastronomers. These letters being sometimes insufficient, Hevelius added\r\nnumbers, but the numbers in _Flamsteed's Catalogue_ are now generally\r\nused.\r\n\r\nPtolemy and all the ancient writers described the constellation figures as\r\nthey are seen on globes, that is from the outside. Bayer in his Atlas,\r\npublished in 1603, reversed the figures to show them as they would be seen\r\nfrom the _interior_ of a hollow globe and as, of course, they are seen in\r\nthe sky. Hevelius again reversed Bayer's figures to make them correspond\r\nwith those of Ptolemy. According to Bayer's arrangement, Betelgeuse\r\n([Greek: a] Orionis) would be on the left shoulder of Orion, instead of\r\nthe right shoulder according to Ptolemy and Al-Sufi, and Rigel ([Greek: b]\r\nOrionis) on the right foot (Bayer) instead of the left foot (Ptolemy).\r\nThis change of position has led to some confusion; but at present the\r\npositions of the stars are indicated by their Right Ascensions and\r\nDeclinations, without any reference to their positions in the ancient\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\nThe classical constellations of Hipparchus and Ptolemy number forty-eight,\r\nand this is the number described by Al-Sufi in his \"Description of the\r\nFixed Stars\" written in the tenth century A.D.\r\n\r\nFirminicus gives the names of several constellations not mentioned by\r\nPtolemy. M. Fréret thought that these were derived from the Egyptian\r\nsphere of Petosiris. Of these a Fox was placed north of the Scorpion; a\r\nconstellation called Cynocephalus near the southern constellation of the\r\nAltar (Ara); and to the north of Pisces was placed a Stag. But all these\r\nhave long since been discarded. Curious to say neither the Dragon nor\r\nCepheus appears on the old Egyptian sphere.[389]\r\n\r\nOther small constellations have also been formed by various astronomers\r\nfrom time to time, but these have disappeared from our modern star maps.\r\nThe total number of constellations now recognized in both hemispheres\r\namounts to eighty-four.\r\n\r\nThe first catalogue formed was nominally that of Eudoxus in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C. (about 370 B.C.). But this can hardly be dignified by the\r\nname of catalogue, as it contained only forty-seven stars, and it omits\r\nseveral of the brighter stars, notably Sirius! The first complete (or\r\nnearly complete) catalogue of stars visible to the naked eye was that of\r\nHipparchus about 129 B.C. Ptolemy informs us that it was the sudden\r\nappearance of a bright new or \"temporary star\" in the year 134 B.C. in the\r\nconstellation Scorpio which led Hipparchus to form his catalogue, and\r\nthere seems to be no reason to doubt the accuracy of this statement, as\r\nthe appearance of this star is recorded in the Chinese Annals. The\r\nCatalogue of Hipparchus contains only 1080 stars; but as many more are\r\nvisible to the naked eye, Hipparchus must have omitted those which are not\r\nimmediately connected with the old constellation figures of men and\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nHipparchus' Catalogue was revised by Ptolemy in his famous work the\r\n_Almagest_. Ptolemy reduced the positions of the stars given by Hipparchus\r\nto the year 137 A.D.; but used a wrong value of the precession which only\r\ncorresponded to about 50 A.D.; and he probably adopted the star magnitudes\r\nof Hipparchus without any revision. Indeed, it seems somewhat doubtful\r\nwhether Ptolemy made any observations of the brightness of the stars\r\nhimself. Ptolemy's catalogue contains 1022 stars.\r\n\r\nProf. De Morgan speaks of Ptolemy as \"a splendid mathematician and an\r\nindifferent observer\"; and from my own examination of Al-Sufi's work on\r\nthe Fixed Stars, which was based on Ptolemy's work, I think that De\r\nMorgan's criticism is quite justified.\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi's _Description of the Fixed Stars_ was written in the tenth\r\ncentury and contains 1018 stars. He seems to have adopted the _positions_\r\nof the stars given by Ptolemy, merely correcting them for the effects of\r\nprecession; but he made a very careful revision of the star magnitudes of\r\nPtolemy (or Hipparchus) from his own observations, and this renders his\r\nwork the most valuable, from this point of view, of all the ancient\r\ncatalogues.\r\n\r\nVery little is known about Al-Sufi's life, and the few details we have are\r\nchiefly derived from the works of the historians Abu'-l-faradji and\r\nCasiri, and the Oriental writers Hyde, Caussin, Sedillot, etc. Al-Sufi's\r\ncomplete name was Abd-al-Rahmän Bin Umar Bin Muhammad Bin Sahl\r\nAbu'l-husaïn al-Sufi al-Razi. The name Sufi indicates that he belonged to\r\nthe sect of Sufis (Dervishes), and the name Razi that he lived in the town\r\nof Raï in Persia, to the east of Teheran. He was born on December 7, 903\r\nA.D., and died on May 25, 986, so that, like many other astronomers, he\r\nlived to a good old age. According to ancient authorities, Al-Sufi--as he\r\nis usually called--was a very learned man, who lived at the courts of\r\nSchiraz and Baghdad under Adhad-al-Davlat--of the dynasty of the\r\nBuïdes--who was then the ruler of Persia. Al-Sufi was held in high esteem\r\nand great favour by this prince, who said of him, \"Abd-al-Rahmän al-Sufi\r\ntaught me to know the names and positions of the fixed stars, Scharif Ibn\r\nal-Aalam the use of astronomical tables, and Abu Ali al-Farisi instructed\r\nme in the principles of grammar.\" Prince Adhad-al-Davlat died on March 26,\r\n983. According to Caussin, Al-Sufi also wrote a book on astrology, and a\r\nwork entitled _Al-Ardjouze_, which seems to have been written in verse,\r\nbut its subject is unknown. He also seems to have determined the exact\r\nlength of the year, and to have undertaken geodetic measurements. The\r\nal-Aalam mentioned above was also an able astronomer, and in addition to\r\nnumerous observations made at Baghdad, he determined with great care the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes. He found the annual constant of precession to\r\nbe 51\"·4, a value which differs but little from modern results.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1874, the late M. Schjellerup, the eminent Danish astronomer,\r\npublished a French translation of two Arabic manuscripts written by\r\nAl-Sufi and entitled \"A Description of the Fixed Stars.\" One of these\r\nmanuscripts is preserved in the Royal Library at Copenhagen, and the other\r\nin the Imperial Library at St. Petersburgh.[390]\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi seems to have been a most careful and accurate observer, and\r\nalthough, as a rule, his estimates of the relative brightness of stars are\r\nin fairly good agreement with modern estimates and photometric measures,\r\nthere are many remarkable and interesting differences. Al-Sufi's\r\nobservations have an important bearing on the supposed \"secular variation\"\r\nof the stars; that is, the slow variation in light which may have occurred\r\nin the course of ages in certain stars, apart from the periodical\r\nvariation which is known to occur in the so-called variable stars. More\r\nthan 900 years have now elapsed since the date of Al-Sufi's observations\r\n(about A.D. 964) and over 2000 years in the case of Hipparchus, and\r\nalthough these periods are of course very short in the life-history of any\r\nstar, still _some_ changes may possibly have taken place in the brightness\r\nof some of them. There are several cases in which a star seems to have\r\ndiminished in light since Al-Sufi's time. This change seems to have\r\ncertainly occurred in the case of [Greek: th] Eridani, [Greek: b] Leonis,\r\n[Greek: z] Piscis Australis, and some others. On the other hand, some\r\nstars seem to have certainly increased in brightness, and the bearing of\r\nthese changes on the question of \"stellar evolution\" will be obvious.\r\n\r\nIn most cases Al-Sufi merely mentions the magnitude which he estimated a\r\nstar to be; such as \"third magnitude,\" \"fourth,\" \"small third magnitude,\"\r\n\"large fourth,\" etc. In some cases, however, he directly states that a\r\ncertain star is a little brighter than another star near it. Such\r\ncases--unfortunately not numerous--are very valuable for comparison with\r\nmodern estimates and measures, when variation is suspected in the light of\r\na star. The estimates of Argelander, Heis, and Houzeau are based on the\r\nsame scale as that used by Ptolemy and Al-Sufi. Al-Sufi's estimates are\r\ngiven in thirds of a magnitude. Thus, \"small third magnitude\" means 3-1/3,\r\nor 3·33 magnitude in modern measures; \"large fourth,\" 3-2/3 or 3·66\r\nmagnitude. These correspond with the estimates of magnitude given by\r\nArgelander, Heis, and Houzeau in their catalogues of stars visible to the\r\nnaked eye, and so the estimates can be directly compared.\r\n\r\nI have made an independent identification of all the stars mentioned by\r\nAl-Sufi. In the majority of cases my identifications concur with those of\r\nSchjellerup; but in some cases I cannot agree with him. In a few cases I\r\nhave found that Al-Sufi himself, although accurately describing the\r\nposition of the stars observed by _him_, has apparently misidentified the\r\nstar observed by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. This becomes evident when we plot\r\nPtolemy's positions (as given by Al-Sufi) and compare them with Al-Sufi's\r\ndescriptions of the stars observed by him. This I have done in all cases\r\nwhere there seemed to be any doubt; and in this way I have arrived at some\r\ninteresting results which have escaped the notice of Schjellerup. This\r\nexamination shows clearly, I think, that Al-Sufi did not himself measure\r\nthe _positions_ of the stars he observed, but merely adopted those of\r\nPtolemy, corrected for the effect of precession. The great value of his\r\nwork, however, consists in his estimates of star magnitudes, which seem to\r\nhave been most carefully made, and from this point of view, his work is\r\ninvaluable. Prof. Pierce says, \"The work which the learning of M.\r\nSchjellerup has brought to light is so important that the smallest errors\r\nof detail become interesting.\"[391]\r\n\r\nAlthough Al-Sufi's work is mentioned by the writers referred to above, no\r\ncomplete translation of his manuscript was made until the task was\r\nundertaken by Schjellerup, and even now Al-Sufi's name is not mentioned\r\nin some popular works on astronomy! But he was certainly the best of all\r\nthe old observers, and his work is deserving of the most careful\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi's descriptions of the stars were, it is true, based on Ptolemy's\r\ncatalogue, but his work is not a mere translation of that of his\r\npredecessor. It is, on the contrary, a careful and independent survey of\r\nthe heavens, made from his own personal observations, each of Ptolemy's\r\nstars having been carefully examined as to its position and magnitude, and\r\nPtolemy's mistakes corrected. In examining his descriptions, Schjellerup\r\nsays, \"We soon see the vast extent of his labours, his perseverance, and\r\nthe minute accuracy and almost modern criticism with which he executed his\r\nwork.\" In fact, Al-Sufi has given us a careful description of the starry\r\nsky as it appeared in his time, and one which deserves the greatest\r\nconfidence. It far surpasses the work of Ptolemy, which had been without a\r\nrival for eight centuries previously, and it has only been equalled in\r\nmodern times by the surveys of Argelander, Gould, Heis, and Houzeau. Plato\r\nremarked with reference to the catalogue of Hipparchus, _Coelam posteris\r\nin hereditatem relictum_, and the same may be said of Al-Sufi's work. In\r\naddition to his own estimates of star magnitudes, Al-Sufi adds the\r\nmagnitudes given by Ptolemy whenever Ptolemy's estimate differs from his\r\nown; and this makes his work still more valuable, as Ptolemy's magnitudes\r\ngiven in all the editions of the _Almagest_ now extant are quite\r\nuntrustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his translation of Al-Sufi's work, Schjellerup mentions\r\nsome remarkable discrepancies between the magnitudes assigned to certain\r\nstars by Ptolemy and Argelander. This comparison is worthy of confidence\r\nas it is known that both Al-Sufi and Argelander adopted Ptolemy's (or\r\nHipparchus') scale of magnitudes. For example, all these observers agree\r\nthat [Greek: b] Ursæ Minoris (Ptolemy's No. 6 of that constellation) is of\r\nthe 2nd magnitude, while in the case of [Greek: g] Ursæ Minoris (Ptolemy's\r\nNo. 7), Ptolemy called it 2nd, and Argelander rated it 3rd; Argelander\r\nthus making [Greek: g] one magnitude fainter than Ptolemy's estimate. Now,\r\nAl-Sufi, observing over 900 years ago, rated [Greek: g] of the 3rd\r\nmagnitude, thus correcting Ptolemy and agreeing with Argelander. Modern\r\nphotometric measures confirm the estimates of Al-Sufi and Argelander. But\r\nit is, of course, possible that one or both stars may be variable in\r\nlight, and [Greek: b] has actually been suspected of variation. Almost all\r\nthe constellations afford examples of this sort. In the majority of cases,\r\nhowever, Al-Sufi agrees well with Argelander and Heis, but there are in\r\nsome cases differences which suggest a change in relative brightness.\r\n\r\nAmong other remarkable things contained in Al-Sufi's most interesting work\r\nmay be mentioned the great nebula in Andromeda, which was first noticed in\r\nEurope as visible to the naked eye by Simon Marius in 1612. Al-Sufi,\r\nhowever, speaks of it as a familiar object in his time.\r\n\r\nSchjellerup says--\r\n\r\n    \"For a long time many of the stars in Ptolemy's catalogue could not be\r\n    identified in the sky. Most of these discordances were certainly due\r\n    to mistakes in copying, either in longitude or latitude. Many of these\r\n    differences were, however, corrected by the help of new manuscripts.\r\n    For this purpose Al-Sufi's work is of great importance. By a direct\r\n    examination of the sky he succeeded in finding nearly all the stars\r\n    reported by Ptolemy (or Hipparchus). And even if his criticism may\r\n    sometimes seem inconclusive, his descriptions are not subject to\r\n    similar defects, his positions not depending solely on the places\r\n    given in Ptolemy's catalogue. For, in addition to the longitudes and\r\n    latitudes quoted from Ptolemy, he has described by alignment the\r\n    positions of the stars referred to. In going from the brightest and\r\n    best known stars of each constellation he indicates the others either\r\n    by describing some peculiarity in their position, or by giving their\r\n    mutual distance as so many cubits (_dzirâ_), or a span (_schibr_),\r\n    units of length which were used at that time to measure apparent\r\n    celestial distances. The term _dzirâ_ means literally the fore-arm\r\n    from the bone of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, or an ell.\r\n    We should not, however, conclude from this that the Arabians were so\r\n    unscientific as to measure celestial distances by an ell, as this\r\n    would be quite in contradiction to their well-known knowledge of\r\n    Geometry and Trigonometry.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the arc or angular distance indicated by the \"cubit,\"\r\nAl-Sufi states in his description of the constellation Auriga that the\r\n_dzirâ_ (or cubit) is equal to 2° 20'. Three cubits, therefore, represent\r\n7°, and 4 cubits 9° 20'.\r\n\r\nIn Al-Sufi's own preface to his work, after first giving glory to God and\r\nblessings on \"his elected messenger Muhammed and his family,\" he proceeds\r\nto state that he had often \"met with many persons who wished to know the\r\nfixed stars, their positions on the celestial vault, and the\r\nconstellations, and had found that these persons may be divided into two\r\nclasses. One followed the method of astronomers and trust to spheres\r\ndesigned by artists, who not knowing, the stars themselves, take only the\r\nlongitudes and latitudes which they find in the books, and thus place the\r\nstars on the sphere, without being able to distinguish truth from error.\r\nIt then follows that those who really know the stars in the sky find on\r\nexamining these spheres that many stars are otherwise than they are in the\r\nsky. Among these are Al-Battani, Atârid and others.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi seems rather hard on Al-Battani (or Albategnius as he is usually\r\ncalled) for he is generally considered to have been the most\r\ndistinguished of the Arabian astronomers. His real name was Mohammed Ibn\r\nJaber Ibn Senan Abu Abdallah Al-Harrani. He was born about A.D. 850 at\r\nBattan, near Harran in Mesopotamia, and died about A.D. 929. He was the\r\nfirst to make use of sines instead of chords, and versed sines. The\r\n_Alphonsine Tables_ of the moon's motions were based on his observations.\r\n\r\nAfter some severe criticisms on the work of Al-Battani and Atârid, Al-Sufi\r\ngoes on to say that the other class of amateurs who desire to know the\r\nfixed stars follow the method of the Arabians in the science of\r\n_Anva_[392] and the mansions of the moon and the books written on this\r\nsubject. Al-Sufi found many books on the _anva_, the best being those of\r\nAbu Hanifa al-Dînavari. This work shows that the author knew the Arabic\r\ntradition better than any of the other writers on the subject. Al-Sufi,\r\nhowever, doubts that he had a good knowledge of the stars themselves, for\r\nif he had he would not have followed the errors of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nAccording to Al-Sufi, those who know one of these methods do not know the\r\nother. Among these is Abu-Hanifa, who states in his book that the names of\r\nthe twelve signs (of the Zodiac) did not originate from the arrangement\r\nor configuration of the stars resembling the figure from which the name\r\nis derived. The stars, Abu-Hanifa said, \"change their places, and although\r\nthe names of the signs do not change, yet the arrangement of the stars\r\nceases to be the same. This shows that he was not aware of the fact that\r\nthe arrangement of the stars does not change, and their mutual distances\r\nand their latitudes, north and south of the ecliptic, are neither\r\nincreased nor diminished.\" \"The stars,\" Al-Sufi says, \"do not change with\r\nregard to their configurations, because they are carried along together by\r\na physical motion and by a motion round the poles of the ecliptic. This is\r\nwhy they are called fixed. Abu-Hanifa supposed that they are termed fixed\r\nbecause their motion is very slow in comparison with that of the planets.\"\r\n\"These facts,\" he says, \"can only be known to those who follow the method\r\nof the astronomers and are skilled in mathematics.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi says that the stars of the Zodiac have a certain movement\r\nfollowing the order of the signs, which according to Ptolemy and his\r\npredecessors is a degree in 100 years. But according to the authors of\r\n_al-mumtahan_ and those who have observed subsequently to Ptolemy, it is a\r\ndegree in 66 years. According to modern measures, the precession is about\r\n50\"·35 per annum, or one degree in 71-1/2 years.\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi says that the Arabians did not make use of the figures of the\r\nZodiac in their proper signification, because they divided the\r\ncircumference of the sky by the number of days which the moon took to\r\ndescribe it--about 28 days--and they looked for conspicuous stars at\r\nintervals which, to the eye, the moon appeared to describe in a day and a\r\nnight. They began with _al-scharataïn_, \"the two marks\" ([Greek: a] and\r\n[Greek: b] Arietis) which were the first striking points following the\r\npoint of the spring equinox. They then sought behind these two marks\r\nanother point at a distance from them, equal to the space described by the\r\nmoon in a day and a night. In this way they found _al-butaïn_ ([Greek: e],\r\n[Greek: d], and [Greek: r] Arietis); after that _al-tsuraija_, the\r\nPleiades; then _al-dabaran_, the Hyades, and thus all the \"mansions\" of\r\nthe moon. They paid no attention to the signs of the Zodiac, nor to the\r\nextent of the figures which composed them. This is why they reckoned among\r\nthe \"mansions\" _al-haka_ ([Greek: l] Orionis) which forms no part of the\r\nsigns of the Zodiac, since it belongs to the southern constellation of the\r\nGiant (Orion). And similarly for other stars near the Zodiac, of which\r\nAl-Sufi gives some details. He says that Regulus ([Greek: a] Leonis) was\r\ncalled by the Arabians _al-maliki_, the Royal Star, and that _al-anva_\r\nconsists of five stars situated in the two wings of the Virgin. These\r\nstars seem to be [Greek: b], [Greek: ê], [Greek: g], [Greek: d], and\r\n[Greek: e] Virginis, which form with Spica ([Greek: a] Virginis) a\r\nY-shaped figure. Spica was called _simak al-azal_, the unarmed _simak_;\r\nthe \"armed _simak_\" being Arcturus, _simak al-ramih_. These old Arabic\r\nnames seem very fanciful.\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi relates that in the year 337 of the Hegira (about A.D. 948) he\r\nwent to Ispahan with Prince Abul-fadhl, who introduced him to an\r\ninhabitant of that city, named Varvadjah, well known in that country, and\r\nfamous for his astronomical acquirements. Al-Sufi asked him the names of\r\nthe stars on an astrolabe which he had, and he named Aldebaran, the two\r\nbright stars in the Twins (Castor and Pollux), Regulus, Sirius, and\r\nProcyon, the two Simaks, etc. Al-Sufi also asked him in what part of the\r\nsky _Al-fard_ ([Greek: a] Hydræ) was, but he did not know! Afterwards, in\r\nthe year 349, this same man was at the court of Prince Adhad-al-Davlat,\r\nand in the presence of the Prince, Al-Sufi asked him the name of a bright\r\nstar--it was _al-nasr al-vaki_, the falling Vulture (Vega), and he\r\nreplied, \"That is _al-aijuk_\" (Capella)! thus showing that he only knew\r\nthe _names_ of the stars, but did not know them when he saw them in the\r\nsky. Al-Sufi adds that all the women \"who spin in their houses\" knew this\r\nstar (Vega) by the name of _al-atsafi_, the Tripod. But this could not be\r\nsaid even of \"educated women\" at the present day.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the number of stars which can be seen with the naked\r\neye, Al-Sufi says, \"Many people believe that the total number of fixed\r\nstars is 1025, but this is an evident error. The ancients only observed\r\nthis number of stars, which they divided into six classes according to\r\nmagnitude. They placed the brightest in the 1st magnitude; those which are\r\na little smaller in the 2nd; those which are a little smaller again in the\r\n3rd; and so on to the 6th. As to those which are below the 6th magnitude,\r\nthey found that their number was too great to count; and this is why they\r\nhave omitted them. It is easy to convince one's self of this. If we\r\nattentively fix our gaze on a constellation of which the stars are well\r\nknown and registered, we find in the spaces between them many other stars\r\nwhich have not been counted. Take, for example, the Hen [Cygnus]; it is\r\ncomposed of seventeen internal stars, the first on the beak, the brightest\r\non the tail, the others on the wings, the neck and the breast; and below\r\nthe left wing are two stars which do not come into the figure. Between\r\nthese different stars, if you examine with attention, you will perceive a\r\nmultitude of stars, so small and so crowded that we cannot determine their\r\nnumber. It is the same with all the other constellations.\" These remarks\r\nare so correct that they might have been written by a modern astronomer.\r\nIt should be added, however, that _all_ the faint stars referred to by\r\nAl-Sufi--and thousands of others still fainter--have now been mapped down\r\nand their positions accurately determined.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1437, Ulugh Beigh, son of Shah Rokh, and grandson of the\r\nMogul Emperor Tamerlane, published a catalogue of stars in which he\r\ncorrected Ptolemy's positions. But he seems to have accepted Al-Sufi's\r\nstar magnitudes without any attempt at revision. This is unfortunate, for\r\nan _independent_ estimate of star magnitudes made in the fifteenth century\r\nwould now be very valuable for comparison with Al-Sufi's work and with\r\nmodern measures. Ulugh Beigh's catalogue contains 1018 stars, nearly the\r\nsame number as given by Ali-Sufi.[393]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nThe Constellations[394]\r\n\r\n\r\nCurious to say, Al-Sufi rated the Pole Star as 3rd magnitude; for it is\r\nnow only slightly less than the 2nd. At present it is about the same\r\nbrightness as [Greek: b] of the same constellation (Ursa Minor) which\r\nAl-Sufi rated 2nd magnitude. It was, however, also rated 3rd magnitude by\r\nPtolemy (or Hipparchus), and it may possibly have varied in brightness\r\nsince ancient times. Admiral Smyth says that in his time (1830) it was\r\n\"not even a very bright third size\" (!)[395] Spectroscopic measures show\r\nthat it is approaching the earth at the rate of 16 miles a second; but\r\nthis would have no perceptible effect on its brightness in historical\r\ntimes. This may seem difficult to understand, and to some perhaps\r\nincredible; but the simple explanation is that its distance from the earth\r\nis so great that a journey of even 2000 years with the above velocity\r\nwould make no _appreciable_ difference in its distance! This is\r\nundoubtedly true, as a simple calculation will show, and the fact will\r\ngive some idea of the vast distance of the stars. The well-known 9th\r\nmagnitude companion to the Pole Star was seen _by day_ in the Dorpat\r\ntelescope by Struve and Wrangel; and \"on one occasion by Encke and\r\nArgelander.\"[396]\r\n\r\nThe star [Greek: b] Ursæ Minoris was called by the Arabians _Kaukab\r\nal-shamáli_, the North Star, as it was--owing to the precession of the\r\nEquinoxes--nearer to the Pole in ancient times than our present Pole Star\r\nwas _then_.\r\n\r\nThe \"Plough\" (or Great Bear) is supposed to represent a waggon and horses.\r\n\"Charles' Wain\" is a corruption of \"churl's wain,\" or peasant's cart. The\r\nArabians thought that the four stars in the quadrilateral represented a\r\nbier, and the three in the \"tail\" the children of the deceased following\r\nas mourners! In the Greek mythology, Ursa Major represented the nymph\r\nCallisto, a daughter of Lycaon, who was loved by Jupiter, and turned into\r\na bear by the jealous Juno. Among the old Hindoos the seven stars\r\nrepresented the seven Rishis. It is the Otawa of the great Finnish epic,\r\nthe \"Kalevala.\" It was also called \"David's Chariot,\" and in America it\r\nis known as \"The Dipper.\"\r\n\r\nClosely north of the star [Greek: th] in Ursa Major is a small star known\r\nas Flamsteed 26. This is not mentioned by Al-Sufi, but is now, I find from\r\npersonal observation, very visible, and indeed conspicuous, to the naked\r\neye. I find, however, that owing to the large \"proper motion\" of the\r\nbright star (1\"·1 per annum) the two stars were much closer together in\r\nAl-Sufi's time than they are at present, and this probably accounts for\r\nAl-Sufi's omission. This is an interesting and curious fact, and shows the\r\nsmall changes which occur in the heavens during the course of ages.\r\n\r\nClose to the star [Greek: z], the middle star of the \"tail\" of Ursa Major\r\n(or handle of the \"Plough\"), is a small star known as Alcor, which is\r\neasily visible to good eyesight without optical aid. It is mentioned by\r\nAl-Sufi, who says the Arabians called it _al-suha_, \"the little unnoticed\r\none.\" He says that \"Ptolemy does not mention it, and it is a star which\r\nseems to test the powers of the eyesight.\" He adds, however, an Arabian\r\nproverb, \"I show him _al-suha_, and he shows me the moon,\" which seems to\r\nsuggest that to some eyes, at least, it was no test of sight at all. It\r\nhas, however, been suspected of variation in light. It was rated 5th\r\nmagnitude by Argelander, Heis, and Houzeau, but was measured 4·02 at\r\nHarvard Observatory. It has recently been found to be a spectroscopic\r\nbinary.\r\n\r\nThe constellation of the Dragon (Draco) is probably referred to in Job\r\n(chap. xxvi. v. 13), where it is called \"the crooked serpent.\" In the\r\nGreek mythology it is supposed to represent the dragon which guarded the\r\ngolden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides. Some have suggested that it\r\nrepresented the serpent which tempted Eve. Dryden says, in his translation\r\nof Virgil--\r\n\r\n  \"Around our Pole the spiry Dragon glides,\r\n  And like a wand'ring stream the Bears divides.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that the constellation Boötis rises quickly and sets slowly,\r\nowing to its lying horizontally when rising and vertically when setting,\r\nwas noted by Aratus, who says--\r\n\r\n  \"The Bearward now, past seen,\r\n  But more obscured, near the horizon lies;\r\n  For with the four Signs the Ploughman, as he sinks,\r\n  The deep receives; and when tired of day\r\n  At even lingers more than half the night,\r\n  When with the sinking sun he likewise sets\r\n  These nights from his late setting bear their name.\"[397]\r\n\r\nThe cosmical setting of Boötis--that is, when he sets at sunset--is stated\r\nby Ovid to occur on March 5 of each year.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the constellation Hercules, Admiral Smyth says--\r\n\r\n    \"The kneeling posture has given rise to momentous discussion; and\r\n    whether it represents Lycaon lamenting his daughter's transformation,\r\n    or Prometheus sentenced, or Ixion ditto, or Thamyrus mourning his\r\n    broken fiddle, remains still uncertain. But in process of time, this\r\n    figure became a lion, and Hyginus mentions both the lion's skin and\r\n    the club; while the right foot's being just over the head of the\r\n    Dragon, satisfied the mythologists that he was crushing the Lernæan\r\n    hydra.... Some have considered the emblem as typifying the serpent\r\n    which infested the vicinity of Cape Tænarus, whence a sub-genus of\r\n    Ophidians still derives its name. At all events a poet, indignant at\r\n    the heathen exaltation of Hevelius, has said--\r\n\r\n        \"'To Cerberus, too, a place is given--\r\n        His home of old was far from heaven.'\"[398]\r\n\r\nAratus speaks of Hercules as \"the Phantom whose name none can tell.\"\r\n\r\nThere were several heroes of the name of Hercules, but the most famous was\r\nHercules the Theban, son of Jupiter and Alcmene wife of Amphitryon, King\r\nof Thebes, who is said to have lived some years before the siege of Troy,\r\nand went on the voyage of the Argonauts about 1300 B.C. According to some\r\nancient writers, another Hercules lived about 2400 B.C., and was a\r\ncontemporary of Atlas and Theseus. But according to Pétau, Atlas lived\r\nabout 1638 B.C., and Lalande thought that this chronology is the more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nThe small constellation Lyra, which contains the bright star Vega, is\r\ncalled by Al-Sufi the Lyre, the Goose, the Persian harp, and the Tortoise.\r\nIn his translation of Al-Sufi's work, Schjellerup suggests that the name\r\n\"Goose\" may perhaps mean a plucked goose, which somewhat resembles a Greek\r\nlyre, and also a tortoise. The name of the bright star Vega is a\r\ncorruption of the Arabic _vâki_. Ptolemy and Al-Sufi included all the very\r\nbrightest stars in the \"first magnitude,\" making no distinction between\r\nthem, but it is evident at a glance that several of them, such as Arcturus\r\nand Vega, are brighter than an average star of the first magnitude, like\r\nAldebaran.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Perseus, which lies south-east of \"Cassiopeia's Chair,\"\r\nmay be recognized by the festoon formed by some of its stars, the bright\r\nstar [Greek: a] Persei being among them. It is called by Al-Sufi\r\n\"_barschânsch_, [Greek: Perseus], Perseus, who is _hamil râs al-gul_, the\r\nBearer of the head of _al-gul_.\" According to Kazimirski, \"_Gul_ was a\r\nkind of demon or ogre who bewilders travellers and devours them, beginning\r\nat the feet. In general any mischievous demon capable of taking all sorts\r\nof forms.\" In the Greek mythology Perseus was supposed to be the son of\r\nJupiter and Danæ. He is said to have been cast into the sea with his\r\nmother and saved by King Polydectus. He afterwards cut off the head of\r\nMedusa, one of the Gorgons, while she slept, and armed with this he\r\ndelivered Andromeda from the sea-monster.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Auriga lies east of Perseus and contains the bright star\r\nCapella, one of the three brightest stars in the northern hemisphere (the\r\nothers being Arcturus and Vega). Theon, in his commentary on Aratus, says\r\nthat Bellerophon invented the chariot, and that it is represented in the\r\nheavens by Auriga, the celestial coachman. According to Dupuis, Auriga\r\nrepresents Phæton, who tried to drive the chariot of the sun, and losing\r\nhis head fell into the river Eridanus. The setting of Eridanus precedes by\r\na few minutes that of Auriga, which was called by some of the ancient\r\nwriters Amnis Phaï-tontis.[399] Auriga is called by Al-Sufi _numsick\r\nal-ainna_--He who holds the reins, the Coachman; also _al-inâz_, the\r\nShe-goat. M. Dorn found in Ptolemy's work, the Greek name [Greek:\r\nHêniochoi], Auriga, written in Arabic characters. Al-Sufi says, \"This\r\nconstellation is represented by the figure of a standing man behind 'He\r\nwho holds the head of _al-gûl_' [Perseus], and between the Pleiades and\r\nthe Great Bear.\"\r\n\r\nCapella is, Al-Sufi says, \"the bright and great star of the first\r\nmagnitude which is on the left shoulder [of the ancient figure] on the\r\neastern edge of the Milky Way. It is that which is marked on the astrolabe\r\nas _al-aijûk_.\" The real meaning of this name is unknown. Schjellerup\r\nthought, contrary to what Ideler says, that the name is identical with\r\nthe Greek word [Greek: Aix] (a goat). Capella was observed at Babylon\r\nabout 2000 B.C., and was then known as Dilgan. The Assyrian name was\r\n_Icu_, and the Persian name _colca_. It was also called Capra Hircus,\r\nCabrilla, Amalthea, and Olenia. In ancient times the rising of Capella was\r\nsupposed to presage the approach of storms. Ovid says, \"Olenia sidus\r\npluviale Capellæ.\"\r\n\r\nThe constellation Aquila is called by Al-Sufi _al-ukab_, the Eagle, or\r\n_al-nasr al-tâïr_, the flying vulture. According to the ancient poets the\r\neagle carried nectar to Jupiter when he was hidden in a cave in Crete.\r\nThis eagle also assisted Jupiter in his victory over the Giants and\r\ncontributed to his other pleasures. For these reasons the eagle was\r\nconsecrated to Jupiter, and was placed in the sky. Al-Sufi says, \"There\r\nare in this figure three famous stars [[Greek: g], [Greek: a], and [Greek:\r\nb] Aquilæ], which are called _al-nasr al-tâïr_.\" Hence is derived the\r\nmodern name Altair for the bright star [Greek: a] Aquilæ. Al-Sufi says\r\nthat the \"common people\" call \"the three famous stars\" _al-mîzân_, the\r\nBalance, on account of the equality of the stars.\" This probably refers to\r\nthe approximately equal distances between [Greek: g] and [Greek: a], and\r\n[Greek: a] and [Greek: b], and not to their relative brightness. He says\r\n\"Between the bright one of the tail [[Greek: x] Aquilæ] and the star in\r\nthe beak of the Hen [[Greek: b] Cygni] in the thinnest part of the Milky\r\nWay, we see the figure of a little earthen jar, of which the stars begin\r\nat the bright one in the tail, and extend towards the north-west. [This\r\nseems to refer to [Greek: e] Aquilæ and the small stars near it.] They\r\nthen turn towards the east in the base of the jar, and then towards the\r\nsouth-east to a little cloud [4, 5, etc. Vulpeculæ, a well-known group of\r\nsmall stars] which is found to the north of the two stars in the shaft of\r\nthe Arrow [[Greek: a] and [Greek: b] Sagittæ]. The cloud is on the eastern\r\nedge of the jar, and the bright one on the tail on the western edge; the\r\norifice is turned towards the flying Vulture [Aquila], and the base\r\ntowards the north. Among these are distinguished some of the fourth,\r\nfifth, and sixth magnitudes [including, probably, 110, 111, 112, 113\r\nHercules, and 1 Vulpeculæ] and Ptolemy says nothing of this figure, except\r\nthe bright star in the tail of the Eagle\" (see figure). The above is a\r\ngood example of the minute accuracy of detail in Al-Sufi's description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AL-SUFI'S \"EARTHEN JAR.\"]\r\n\r\nThe southern portion of Aquila was formerly called Antinous, who was said\r\nto have been a young man of great beauty born at Claudiopolis in Bithynia,\r\nand drowned in the Nile. Others say that he sacrificed his life to save\r\nthat of the Emperor Hadrian, who afterwards raised altars in his honour\r\nand placed his image on coins.[400]\r\n\r\nThe constellation Pegasus, Al-Sufi says, \"is represented by the figure of\r\na horse, which has the head, legs, and forepart of the body to the end of\r\nthe back, but it has neither hind quarters nor hind legs.\" According to\r\nBrown, Pegasus was the horse of Poseidon, the sea god. Half of it was\r\nsupposed to be hidden in the sea, into which the river Eridanus\r\nflowed.[401] In the Greek mythology it was supposed to represent the\r\nwinged horse produced by the blood which fell from the head of Medusa when\r\nshe was killed by Perseus! Some think that it represents Bellerophon's\r\nhorse, and others the horse of Nimrod. It was also called Sagmaria and\r\nEphippiatus, and was sometimes represented with a saddle instead of wings.\r\n\r\nIn describing the constellation Andromeda, Al-Sufi speaks of two series of\r\nstars which start from the great nebula in Andromeda; one series going\r\nthrough 32 Andromedæ, [Greek: p, d], and [Greek: e] to [Greek: z] and\r\n[Greek: ê]; and the other through [Greek: n, m, b] Andromedæ into the\r\nconstellation Pisces. He says they enclose a fish-shaped figure called by\r\nthe Arabians _al-hût_, the Fish, _par excellence_. He speaks of two other\r\nseries of stars which begin at [Greek: t] and [Greek: u], and diverging\r\nmeet again at [Greek: ch] Persei, forming another \"fish-like figure.\" The\r\neastern stream starts from [Greek: t] and passes through 55, [Greek: g],\r\n60, 62, 64, and 65 Andromedæ; and the western stream from [Greek: u]\r\nthrough [Greek: ch] 51, 54, and _g_ Persei up to [Greek: ch] Persei. The\r\nhead of the first \"fish,\" _al-hût_, is turned towards the north, and that\r\nof the second towards the south (see figure).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AL-SUFI'S \"FISHES\" IN ANDROMEDA.]\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi says that the stars [Greek: a] Persei, [Greek: g, b, d], and\r\n[Greek: a] Andromedæ, and [Greek: b] Pegasi form a curved line. This is\r\nquite correct, and this fine curve of bright stars may be seen at a glance\r\non a clear night in September, when all the stars are high in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe first constellation of the Zodiac, Aries, the Ram, was called,\r\naccording to Aratus and Eratosthenes, [Greek: krios]. It is mentioned by\r\nOvid under the name of Hellas. It was also called by the ancients the Ram\r\nwith the golden horns. Manilius (fourth century B.C.) called it \"The\r\nPrince.\" It is supposed to have represented the god Bel. Among the\r\nAccadians the sign meant \"He who dwells on the altar of uprightness.\" It\r\nfirst appears on the Egyptian Zodiac; and it was sacred to Jupiter Ammon.\r\nIn the Greek mythology it was supposed to represent the ram, the loss of\r\nwhose fleece led to the voyage of the Argonauts. In the time of\r\nHipparchus, about 2000 years ago, it was the first sign of the Zodiac, or\r\nthat in which the sun is situated at the Vernal Equinox (about March 21 in\r\neach year). But owing to the precession of the equinoxes, this point has\r\nnow moved back into Pisces.\r\n\r\nThe brightest star of Aries ([Greek: a]) is sometimes called Hamal,\r\nderived from the Arabic _al-hamal_, a name given to the constellation\r\nitself by Al-Sufi. In the Accadian language it was called _Dilkur_, \"the\r\ndawn proclaimer.\" Ali-Sufi says that close to [Greek: a], \"as if it were\r\nattached to it,\" is a small star of the 6th magnitude, not mentioned by\r\nPtolemy. This is clearly [Greek: k] Arietis. The fact of Al-Sufi having\r\nseen and noticed this small star, which modern measures show to be below\r\nthe 5th magnitude, is good evidence of his keen eyesight and accuracy of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Al-Sufi, the stars [Greek: b] and [Greek: g] Arietis were\r\ncalled by the Arabians _al-scharatain_, \"the two marks.\" They marked the\r\n\"first mansion of the moon,\" and [Greek: e, d], and [Greek: r] the second\r\nmansion. With reference to these so-called \"mansions of the moon,\" Admiral\r\nSmyth says--\r\n\r\n    \"The famous _Manazil al-kamar_, i.e. Lunar mansions, constituted a\r\n    supposed broad circle in Oriental astronomy divided into twenty-eight\r\n    unequal parts, corresponding with the moon's course, and therefore\r\n    called the abodes of the moon. This was not a bad arrangement for a\r\n    certain class of gazers, since the luminary was observed to be in or\r\n    near one or other of these parts, or constellations every night.\r\n    Though tampered with by astrologers, these Lunar mansions are probably\r\n    the earliest step in ancient astronomy.\"[402]\r\n\r\nTaurus, the second constellation of the Zodiac, was in ancient times\r\nrepresented by the figure of a bull, the hinder part of which is turned\r\ntowards the south-west, and the fore part towards the east. It had no hind\r\nlegs, and the head was turned to one side, with the horns extended towards\r\nthe east. Its most ancient name was _Te_, possibly a corruption of the\r\nAccadian _dimmena_, \"a foundation-stone.\" The Greek name is [Greek: athôr]\r\n([Greek: thôôr], Eusebius). In the old Egyptian mythology Taurus\r\nrepresented the god Apis. According to Dupuis it also represented the 10th\r\n\"labour of Hercules,\" namely, his victory over the cows of Geryon, King of\r\nSpain.[403] It was also supposed to represent the bull under the form of\r\nwhich Jupiter carried off Europa, daughter of Agenor, King of the\r\nPhoenicians. It may also refer to Io or Isis, who is supposed to have\r\ntaught the ancient Egyptians the art of agriculture.\r\n\r\nAldebaran is the well-known bright red star in the Hyades. It was called\r\nby Ptolemy _Fulgur succularum_. Ali-Sufi says it was marked on the old\r\nastrolabes as _al-dabaran_, \"the Follower\" (because it follows the Hyades\r\nin the diurnal motion), and also _ain al-tsaur_, the eye of the bull. It\r\nmay be considered as a standard star of the 1st magnitude. Modern\r\nobservations show that it has a parallax of 0\"·107. It is receding from\r\nthe earth, according to Vogel, at the rate of about 30 miles a second;\r\nbut even with this high velocity it will take thousands of years before\r\nits brightness is perceptibly diminished. It has a faint companion of\r\nabout the 10th magnitude at the distance of 118\", which forms a good\r\n\"light test\" for telescopes of 3 or 4 inches aperture. I saw it well with\r\na 4-inch Wray in the Punjab sky. The Hyades were called _Succulæ_ by the\r\nRomans, and in the Greek mythology were said to be children of Atlas.\r\n\r\nThe star [Greek: b] Tauri, sometimes called Nath, from the Arabic\r\n_al-nátih_, the butting, is a bright star between Capella and [Greek: g]\r\nOrionis (Bellatrix). It is on the tip of the horn in the ancient figure of\r\nTaurus, and \"therefore\" (says Admiral Smyth) \"at the greatest distance\r\nfrom the hoof; can this have given rise to the otherwise pointless sarcasm\r\nof not knowing B from a bull's foot?\"[404] Al-Sufi says that an imaginary\r\nline drawn from the star now known as A Tauri to [Greek: t] Tauri would\r\npass between [Greek: u] and [Greek: k] Tauri, which is quite correct,\r\nanother proof of the accuracy of his observations. He also says that the\r\nstar [Greek: ô] Tauri is exactly midway between A and [Greek: e], which is\r\nagain correct. He points out that Ptolemy's position of [Greek: ô] is\r\nincorrect. This is often the case with Ptolemy's positions, and tends to\r\nshow that Ptolemy adopted the position given by Hipparchus without\r\nattempting to verify their position in the sky. Al-Sufi himself adopts\r\nthe longitudes and latitudes of the stars as given by Ptolemy in the\r\n_Almagest_, but corrects the positions in his _descriptions_, when he\r\nfound Ptolemy's places erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe famous group of the Pleiades is well known; but there is great\r\ndifficulty in understanding Al-Sufi's description of the cluster. He says,\r\n\"The 29th star (of Taurus) is the more northern of the anterior side of\r\nthe Pleiades themselves, and the 30th is the southern of the same side;\r\nthe 31st is the following vertex of the Pleiades, and is in the more\r\nnarrow part. The 32nd is situated outside the northern side. Among these\r\nstars, the 32nd is of the 4th magnitude, the others of the 5th.\" Now, it\r\nis very difficult or impossible to identify these stars with the stars in\r\nthe Pleiades as they are at present. The brightest of all, Alcyone\r\n([Greek: ê] Tauri), now about 3rd magnitude, does not seem to be mentioned\r\nat all by Al-Sufi! as he says distinctly that \"the brightest star\" (No 32\r\nof Taurus) is \"outside\" the Pleiades \"on the northern side.\" It seems\r\nimpossible to suppose that Al-Sufi could have overlooked Alcyone had it\r\nthe same brightness it has now. The 32nd star seems to have disappeared,\r\nor at least diminished greatly in brightness, since the days of Al-Sufi.\r\nMore than four stars were, however, seen by Al-Sufi, for he adds, \"It is\r\ntrue that the stars of the Pleiades must exceed the four mentioned above,\r\nbut I limit myself to these four because they are very near each other and\r\nthe largest [that is, the brightest]; this is why I have mentioned them,\r\nneglecting the others.\" A full examination of the whole question is given\r\nby Flammarion in his interesting work _Les Étoiles_ (pp. 289-307), and I\r\nmust refer my readers to this investigation for further details.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brown, Simonides of Keos (B.C. 556-467) says, \"Atlas was the\r\nsire of seven daughters with violet locks, who are called the heavenly\r\n_Peleiades_.\"[405] The name is by some supposed to be derived from the\r\nGreek [Greek: pleiôn], full. The Old Testament word _Kimah_ (Job ix. 9 and\r\nxxviii. 31) and Amos (v. 8) is derived from the Assyrian _Kimta_, a\r\n\"family.\" Aratus describes the Pleiades in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"Near his[406] left thigh together sweep along\r\n  The flock of Clusterers. Not a mighty span\r\n  Holds all, and they themselves are dim to see,\r\n  And seven paths aloft men say they take,\r\n  Yet six alone are viewed by mortal eye.\r\n  These seven are called by name Alkyonî\r\n  Kelainî, Meropî and Steropî\r\n  Taygetî, Elecktrî, Maia queen.\r\n  They thus together small and faint roll on\r\n  Yet notable at morn and eve through Zeus.\"[407]\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades are mentioned by Ovid. According to the ancient poets they\r\nwere supposed to represent the children of Atlas and Hesperus, and on\r\nthis account they were called Atlantids or Hesperides. From the\r\nresemblance in sound to the word [Greek: pleias], a pigeon, they were\r\nsometimes called \"the doves,\" and for the same reason the word [Greek:\r\nplein], to navigate, led to their being called the \"shipping stars.\" The\r\nword [Greek: pleias] was also applied to the priestesses of the god Zeus\r\n(Jupiter) at Dordona, in the groves of which temple there were a number of\r\npigeons. This is, perhaps, what Aratus refers to in the last line of the\r\nextract quoted above. According to Neapolitan legends, the name of\r\nVirgil's mother was Maia. The mother of Buddha, the Hindoo _avatar_, was\r\nalso named Maia. In Italy the Pleiades were called _Gallinata_, and in\r\nFrance _poussinière_, both of which mean the hen and chickens, a term also\r\ngiven to them by Al-Sufi. The old Blackfoot Indians called them \"The Seven\r\nPerfect Ones.\" The Crees and Ojibway Indians called them the \"Fisher\r\nStars.\" The Adipones of Brazil and some other nations claimed that they\r\nsprang from the Pleiades! The Wyandot Indians called them \"The Singing\r\nMaidens.\"\r\n\r\nPhotographs show that the brighter stars of the Pleiades are involved in\r\nnebulosity. That surrounding Maia seems to be of a spiral form. Now, there\r\nis a Sanscrit myth which represents Maia as \"weaving the palpable\r\nuniverse,\" for which reason she was \"typified as a spider.\" This seems\r\nvery appropriate, considering the web of nebulous light which surrounds\r\nthe stars of the group. Maia was also considered as a type of the\r\nuniverse, which again seems appropriate, as probably most of the stars\r\nwere evolved from spiral nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe name Hyades is supposed to be derived from the Greek word [Greek:\r\nhyein], to rain, because in ancient times they rose at the rainy season.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt, Aldebaran was called _ary_; and the Pleiades _chooa_, a\r\nword which means \"thousands.\" The name Aldebaran seems to have been\r\noriginally applied to the whole of the Hyades group. Aldebaran was also\r\ncalled by the Arabians _al-fanik_, the great Camel, and the Hyades\r\n_al-kilas_, the young Camels. The two close stars [Greek: u] and [Greek:\r\nk] Tauri were called _al-kalbaïn_, the dogs of Aldebaran. La Condamine\r\nstates that the Indians of the Amazon saw in the Hyades the head of a\r\nbull.\r\n\r\nGemini, the Twins, is the third constellation of the Zodiac. It was also\r\ncalled Gemelli, etc. According to Dupuis it represents the 11th \"labour of\r\nHercules\"--his triumph over the dog Cerberus.[408] But some of Dupuis'\r\nideas seem very fanciful. The Twins are usually called Castor and Pollux,\r\nbut they were also called by the ancient writers Apollo and Hercules;\r\nJason and Triptolemus; Amphion and Zethus; and Theseus and Peritheus. In\r\nEgypt they represented the deities Horus and Hippocrates. Brown thinks\r\nthat the \"Great Twins\" were originally the sun and moon, \"who live\r\nalternately. As one is born the other dies; as one rises the other\r\nsets.\"[409] This applies to the full moon, but does not seem applicable to\r\nthe other lunar phases.\r\n\r\nGemini was the constellation to which Dante supposed himself transported\r\nwhen he visited the stellar heavens.[410] He says he was born under the\r\ninfluence of this \"sign.\"\r\n\r\nCancer, the Crab, is the next sign of the Zodiac. In the Greek mythology\r\nit was supposed to have been placed in the sky by Juno to commemorate the\r\ncrab which pinched the toes of Hercules in the Lernæan marsh. The Greek\r\nname was [Greek: tybi]. According to Dupuis it represents the 12th \"labour\r\nof Hercules\"--his capture of the golden apples in the Garden of the\r\nHesperides, which were guarded by a Dragon. This Dragon is Draco, which\r\nwas also called Custos Hesperidum.[411] But the connection between a crab\r\nand the myth of the golden apples is not obvious--unless some reference to\r\n\"crab apples\" is intended! Among the Romans, Cancer was consecrated to\r\nMercury, and by the ancient Egyptians to their god Anubis.\r\n\r\nThe well-known cluster in Cancer called the Præsape, Al-Sufi says, is \"a\r\nlittle spot which resembles a cloud, and is surrounded by four stars, two\r\nto the west [[Greek: ê] and [Greek: th] Cancri] and two to the east\"\r\n[[Greek: g] and [Greek: d]]. This cluster is mentioned by Aratus, who\r\ncalls it the \"Manger.\" The word Præsape is often translated \"Beehive,\" but\r\nthere can be no doubt that it really means \"Manger,\" referring to the\r\nstars [Greek: g] and [Greek: d] Cancri, which the ancients called Aselli,\r\nthe ass's colts. These were supposed to represent the asses which in the\r\nwar of Jupiter against the Giants helped his victory by their braying!\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth says in his _Bedford Catalogue_ (p. 202) that he found\r\n[Greek: g] and [Greek: d] Cancri both of 4th magnitude; but the\r\nphotometric measures show that [Greek: d] is now distinctly brighter than\r\n[Greek: g]. An occultation of [Greek: d] Cancri by the moon is recorded as\r\nhaving occurred on September 3, B.C. 240.\r\n\r\nThe fine constellation Leo, the Lion, is the next \"sign\" of the Zodiac,\r\nand is marked by the well-known \"Sickle.\" According to Dupuis, it\r\nrepresents the first \"labour of Hercules\"--the killing of the Nemælian\r\nlion. Manilius called it Nemæus. It was also called Janonus sidus, Bacchi\r\nsidus, etc. The Greek name was [Greek: mechir], [Greek: mecheir], or\r\n[Greek: mechos]. In ancient Egypt, Leo was sacred to Osiris, and many of\r\nthe Egyptian monuments are ornamented with lions' heads. It is stated in\r\nthe Horapolla that its appearance was supposed to announce the annual\r\nrising of the Nile.\r\n\r\nRegulus ([Greek: a] Leonis) is the brightest and most southern of the\r\nstars in the \"Sickle.\" Al-Sufi says \"it is situated in the heart and is of\r\nthe 1st magnitude. It is that which is called _al-maliki_, the royal star.\r\nIt is marked on the astrolabe as _kalb al-asad_, the Heart of the Lion\"\r\n(whence the name Cor Leonis). Modern photometric measures make it about\r\n1·3 magnitude. It has an 8-1/2 magnitude companion at about 177\" distance\r\n(Burnham) which is moving through space with the bright star, and is\r\ntherefore at probably the same distance from the earth as its brilliant\r\nprimary. This companion is double (8·5, 12·5: 3\"·05, Burnham). The\r\nspectroscope shows that Regulus is approaching the earth at the rate of\r\n5-1/2 miles a second. Its parallax is very small--about 0\"·022, according\r\nto Dr. Elkin--which indicates that it is at a vast distance from the\r\nearth; and its brightness shows that it must be a sun of enormous size.\r\nPtolemy called it [Greek: basiliskos], whence its Latin name Regulus,\r\nfirst used by Copernicus as the diminutive of _rex_.[412]\r\n\r\nThe next constellation of the Zodiac is Virgo, the Virgin. It was also\r\ncalled by the ancients Ceres, Isis, Erigone, Fortuna, Concorda, Astræa,\r\nand Themis. The Greek name was [Greek: phamenôth]. Ceres was the goddess\r\nof the harvest. Brown thinks that it probably represents the ancient\r\ngoddess Istar, and also Ashtoreth. According to Prof. Sayce it is the\r\nsame as the Accadian sign of \"the errand of Istar, a name due to the\r\nbelief that it was in August that the goddess Astarte descended into Hades\r\nin search of her betrothed, the sun god Tammuz, or Adonis, who had been\r\nslain by the boar's tusk.\"[413] The ear of corn (Spica) is found on the\r\nancient Egyptian monuments, and is supposed to represent the fertility\r\ncaused by the annual rising of the Nile. According to Aratus, the Virgin\r\nlived on earth during the golden age under the name of Justice, but that\r\nin the bronze age she left the earth and took up her abode in the heavens.\r\n\r\n  \"Justice, loathing that race of men,\r\n  Winged her flight to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sphinx near the Great Pyramid has the head of a virgin on the body of\r\na lion, representing the goddess Isis (Virgo) and her husband Osiris\r\n(Leo).\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi's 5th star of Virgo is Flamsteed 63 Virginis. Al-Sufi says it is a\r\ndouble star of the 5th magnitude. In Al-Sufi's time it formed a \"naked-eye\r\ndouble\" with 61 Virginis, but owing to large proper motion, 61 has now\r\nmoved about 26 minutes of arc towards the south, and no longer forms a\r\ndouble with 63. This interesting fact was first pointed out by Flammarion\r\nin his work _Les Étoiles_ (p. 373).\r\n\r\nLibra, the Balance, is one of the \"signs\" of the Zodiac, but originally\r\nformed the claws of the Scorpion. It was called Juguna by Cicero, and\r\nMochos by Ampelius. The Greek name was [Greek: pharmouthe]. Virgil\r\nsuggests that it represented the justice of the emperor Augustus, honoured\r\nby the name of a constellation; but probably this refers to the birth of\r\nAugustus under the sign of Libra, as Scaliger has pointed out. According\r\nto Brown, \"the daily seizing of the dying western sun by the claws of the\r\nScorpion of darkness is reduplicated annually at the Autumnal Equinox,\r\nwhen the feeble waning sun of shortening days falls ever earlier into his\r\nenemy's grasp;\"[414] and he says, \"The Balance or Scales (Libra), which it\r\nwill be observed is in itself neither diurnal nor nocturnal, is the only\r\none of the zodiacal signs not Euphratean in origin, having been imported\r\nfrom Egypt and representing originally the balance of the sun at the\r\nhorizon between the upper and under worlds; and secondarily the equality\r\nof the days and nights at the equinox.\"[415]\r\n\r\nAccording to Houzeau, Libra was formed at the beginning of the second\r\ncentury B.C., and it does not appear in any writings before those of\r\nGeminus and Varron.[416]\r\n\r\nMilton says in _Paradise Lost_:--\r\n\r\n  \"The Eternal to prevent such horrid fray,\r\n  Hung forth in heaven his golden scales, yet seen\r\n  Betwixt Astræa and the Scorpion's sign.\"\r\n\r\n(Here Astræa is Virgo.)\r\n\r\nIt is worth noticing that both Ptolemy and Al-Sufi rated the star [Greek:\r\nk] Libræ as two magnitudes brighter than [Greek: l] Libræ. The two stars\r\nare now practically of equal brightness (5th magnitude), and it seems\r\nimpossible to believe that this could have been the case in Al-Sufi's\r\ntime. Surely a careful observer like Al-Sufi, who estimated the relative\r\nbrightness of stars to a third of a magnitude, could not possibly have\r\nmade an error of two magnitudes in the brightness of two stars near each\r\nother! It should be stated, however, that [Greek: k] Libræ was rated 5th\r\nmagnitude by Argelander and Heis, and [Greek: l], 6th magnitude by the\r\nsame excellent observers.\r\n\r\nThe next \"sign\" of the Zodiac, Scorpion, was consecrated by the Romans to\r\nMars, and by the Egyptians to Typhon.[417] It was called _Nepa_ by Cicero,\r\n_Martis sidus_ by Manilius, and _Fera magna_ by Aratus. The Greek name was\r\n[Greek: pachôn].\r\n\r\nMr. E. B. Knobel has called attention to a curious remark of Ptolemy with\r\nreference to the bright star Antares ([Greek: a] Scorpii), \"Media earum\r\nquæ _tendit ad rapinam_ quæ dicitur Cor Scorpionis\"; and he made a similar\r\nremark with reference to Betelgeuse ([Greek: a] Orionis) and others. But\r\nMr. Robert Brown[418] explains the remark by the fact that in ancient\r\ntimes these stars rose in the morning at a time when caravans were exposed\r\nto dangers from robbers. Thus the term had nothing to do with the aspect\r\nor colour of these stars, but was merely a reference to their supposed\r\nastrological influence on human affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the Egyptian _Book of the Dead_, Silkit was a goddess who assumed the\r\nform of a scorpion in the sky. She was supposed to be the daughter of\r\n_Ra_.\r\n\r\nWith reference to stars \"outside\" the ancient figure of Scorpio, the\r\nfirst, Al-Sufi says, \"is a star which immediately follows _al-schaulat_\"\r\n[[Greek: l]] and [Greek: k], \"it is of small 4th magnitude; Ptolemy calls\r\nit [Greek: nepheloeidês]\" [nebulous]. Schjelerup, in his translation of\r\nAl-Sufi's work, does not identify this object; but it is very evidently\r\n[Greek: g] Telescopii, which lies exactly in the position described by\r\nAl-Sufi. Now, it is a very interesting and curious fact that Ptolemy\r\ncalled it nebulous, for in the same telescopic field with it is the nebula\r\n_h_ 3705 (= Dunlop 557). Dunlop describes it as a \"small well-defined\r\nrather bright nebula, about 20\" in diameter; a very small star precedes\r\nit, but is not involved; following [Greek: g] Telescopii.\" Sir John\r\nHerschel at the Cape found it fairly resolved into very faint stars, and\r\nadds, \"The whole _ground_ of the heavens, for an immense extent is\r\nthickly sown with such stars. A beautiful object.\"[419] This perhaps\r\naccounts for the nebulous appearance of the star as seen by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nSeveral _novæ_ or temporary stars are recorded as having appeared in\r\nScorpio. One in the year B.C. 134 is stated by Pliny to have induced\r\nHipparchus to form his catalogue of stars. This star was also observed in\r\nChina. Its exact position is unknown, but Flammarion thinks it may\r\npossibly have appeared about 4° north of the star [Greek: b] Scorpii.\r\nAnother new star is said to have appeared in A.D. 393, somewhere in the\r\nScorpion's tail. One in A.D. 1203 and another in 1584 are also mentioned,\r\nthe latter near [Greek: p] Scorpii.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Scorpio seems to be referred to by Dante in his\r\n_Purgatorio_ (ix. 4-6) in the lines--\r\n\r\n  \"De gemma la sua fronte era lucenta\r\n  Poste in figura del fredda animale\r\n  Che con la coda percota la genta,\"\r\n\r\nperhaps suggested by Ovid's remark--\r\n\r\n  \"Scorpius exhibit caudaque menabitur unca.\"[420]\r\n\r\nNext to Scorpio comes Sagittarius, the Archer. It is said to have been\r\nplaced in the sky as a symbol of Hercules, a hero who was held in the\r\ngreatest veneration by the ancient Egyptians. The horse, usually\r\nassociated with this constellation, was a symbol of war. It was also\r\ncalled by the ancients Chiron, Arcitenens, Minotaurus, Croton, etc. The\r\nGreek name was [Greek: pauni], or [Greek: paôni]. Chiron was supposed to\r\nbe the son of Saturn and Phillyra, and first taught men to ride on horses.\r\nThe name is derived from the Greek [Greek: cheir], a hand. Some writers,\r\nhowever, think that Chiron is represented by the constellation of the\r\nCentaur, and others say that Sagittarius represents the Minotaur loved by\r\nPersephone. According to Dupuis, Sagittarius represents the 5th \"labour of\r\nHercules,\" which consisted in hunting the birds of the lake Stymphalus,\r\nwhich ravaged the neighbouring countries. These birds are perhaps\r\nrepresented by Cygnus, Altair, and the Vulture (Lyra). The Lyre probably\r\nrepresents the musical instrument which Hercules used to frighten the\r\nbirds.[421]\r\n\r\nAccording to Al-Sufi, the Arabians called the stars [Greek: g, d, e], and\r\n[Greek: ê] Sagittarii which form a quadrilateral figure, \"the Ostrich\r\nwhich goes to the watering place,\" because they compared the Milky Way to\r\na river. They compared the stars [Greek: s, ph, t], and [Greek: z]\r\nSagittarii, which form another quadrilateral, to an ostrich which has\r\ndrunk and returns from the \"watering place.\" He says that the star [Greek:\r\nl] Sagittarii forms with these two \"ostriches\" a tent, and certainly the\r\nfigure formed by [Greek: l, ph, z, e], and [Greek: d] is not unlike a\r\ntent. Al-Sufi says more about these \"ostriches\"; but the ideas of the old\r\nArabians about the stars seem very fanciful.\r\n\r\nA \"temporary star\" is recorded in the Chinese Annals of Ma-touan-lin as\r\nhaving appeared in May, B.C. 48, about 4° distant from [Greek: m]\r\nSagittarii. Another in the year 1011 A.D. appeared near the quadrilateral\r\nfigure formed by the stars [Greek: s, t, z], and [Greek: ph] Sagittarii.\r\nThis may perhaps be identified with the object referred to by Hepidannus\r\nin the year 1012, which was of extraordinary brilliancy, and remained\r\nvisible \"in the southern part of the heavens during three months.\" Another\r\nis mentioned near the same place in A.D. 386 (April to July).[422] The\r\nnumber of \"temporary stars\" recorded in this part of the heavens is very\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brown, Sagittarius is depicted on a stone, cir. B.C. 1100,\r\nfound at Bâbilu, and now in the British Museum.[423]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next of the \"signs of the Zodiac\" is Capricornus, the Goat. In the\r\nArabo-Latin edition of Ptolemy's _Almagest_ it is called Alcaucurus. It is\r\nsupposed to represent Amalthea, the goat which nursed Jupiter. According\r\nto Dupuis it represented the 6th \"labour of Hercules,\" which was the\r\ncleaning out of the Augean stables.[424]\r\n\r\n[Greek: a]_{2} Capricorni is the northern of two stars of the 4th\r\nmagnitude ([Greek: a] and [Greek: b] Capricorni). It really consists of\r\ntwo stars visible to the naked eye. The second of these two stars ([Greek:\r\na]_{1}) is not mentioned by Al-Sufi, but I find that, owing to proper\r\nmotion, they were nearer together in his time (tenth century), and were\r\nevidently seen by him as one star. [Greek: b] Capricorni (about 3rd\r\nmagnitude) is a very wide double star (3-1/2, 6; 205\"), which may be seen\r\nwith any small telescope. The fainter star was found to be a close double\r\nby Burnham. At present [Greek: b] is brighter than [Greek: a], although\r\nrated of the same brightness by Al-Sufi.\r\n\r\nAquarius is the next \"sign of the Zodiac.\" It is supposed to represent a\r\nman pouring water out of an urn or bucket. Other names given to this\r\nconstellation were Aristæus, Ganymede, Cecrops, Amphora, Urna, and Aqua\r\ntyrannus. According to Dupuis it represents the 7th \"labour of Hercules,\"\r\nwhich was his victory over the famous bull which ravaged Crete.[425] But\r\nthe connection between a bull and a bucket is not obvious. Aquarius is\r\nrepresented in several places on the Egyptian monuments. Some of the\r\nancient poets supposed that it represented Deucalion (the Noah of the\r\nGreek story of the Deluge); others thought that it represented Cecrops,\r\nwho came to Greece from Egypt, built Athens, and was also called Bifornis.\r\nOthers say that he was Ganymede, the cup-bearer of the gods.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty about the identification of some of Al-Sufi's\r\nstars in Aquarius. His sixth star (Fl. 7) is nearly 10° south-west of\r\n[Greek: b] Aquarii, and is, Al-Sufi says, \"the following of three stars in\r\nthe left hand, and precedes the fourth [[Greek: b]] ... it is of the 6th\r\nmagnitude. Ptolemy calls it third, but in reality it is very faint\" [now\r\nabout 6th magnitude]. The seventh [[Greek: m]] is the middle one of the\r\nthree and about 4-1/2 magnitude, although Al-Sufi calls it \"small fifth\"\r\n[Ptolemy rated it 4]. The eighth star, [Greek: e], is the preceding of the\r\nthree and about 3·8, agreeing closely with Al-Sufi's 4·3. Ptolemy rated it\r\n3. This star is mentioned under the name _nou_ in the time of\r\n_Tcheou-Kong_ in the twelfth century B.C. Al-Sufi says, \"These three stars\r\nare followed by a star of the 5th magnitude which Ptolemy has not\r\nmentioned. It is brighter than the sixth star\" [Fl. 7]. This is evidently\r\n[Greek: n] Aquarii. If, however, we plot Ptolemy's positions as given by\r\nAl-Sufi, it seems probable that _Ptolemy's_ sixth star was really [Greek:\r\nn], and that either [Greek: m] or Fl. 7 was not seen by him. As Ptolemy\r\ncalled his seventh star 4th magnitude, and his sixth and eighth stars 3rd\r\nmagnitude, some considerable change of brightness seems to have taken\r\nplace in these stars; as [Greek: n] is now only 4-1/2 and Fl. 7 only a\r\nbright sixth. Variation was suspected in Fl. 7[426] by Gould. I found it\r\nvery reddish with binocular in October, 1892. Burnham found it to be a\r\nclose double star, the companion being about 12th magnitude at a distance\r\nof only 2\". It is probably a binary.\r\n\r\nAccording to Al-Sufi, the Arabians called the second and third stars of\r\nthe figure ([Greek: a] and [Greek: o] Aquarii) _sad al-malik_ (_malk_ or\r\n_mulk_), \"the Good Fortune of the king.\" They called the fourth and fifth\r\nstars ([Greek: b] and [Greek: x] Aquarii) with the twenty-eighth star of\r\nCapricornus (_c_) _sad al-sund_, \"the Good Fortune of the Happy Events.\"\r\n\"This is the 24th mansion of the moon.\" These stars rose at the time of\r\nyear when the cold ends, and they set at the time the heat ends. Hence,\r\nAl-Sufi says, \"when they rise the rains begin, and when they set the\r\nunhealthy winds cease, fertility abounds, and the dew falls.\" Hence\r\nprobably the Arabic names. This, of course, applies to the climate of\r\nPersia and Arabia, and not to the British Isles. Al-Sufi says, \"They call\r\nthe 6th, 7th, and 8th stars _sad bula_, 'The Good Fortune which swallows\r\nup!' This is the 23rd mansion of the moon. They say that it is so called\r\nbecause that at the time of the Deluge it rose at the moment when God\r\nsaid, 'O earth! absorb the waters' (Koran, chap, xi., v. 46). They called\r\nthe stars [Greek: g, p, z] and [Greek: ê] Aquarii _sad al-achbija_, 'the\r\nthe Good Fortune of the tents'; this is the 25th mansion of the moon, and\r\nthey give them this name because of these four stars, three form a\r\ntriangle, the fourth [[Greek: z]] being in the middle.\" The three were\r\nconsidered to form a tent.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians called the bright star Fomalhaut \"in the mouth of the\r\nsouthern fish _al-dhifda al-auval_, 'the first Frog,' as the bright one on\r\nthe southern point of the tail of Kîtus [Cetus] is called _al-dhifda\r\nal-tsani_ [[Greek: b] Ceti], 'the second Frog.'\" Fomalhaut was also called\r\n_al-zhalim_, \"the male ostrich.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi says, \"Some of the Arabians state that a ship is situated to the\r\nsouth of Aquarius.\" The stars in the Southern Fish (Piscis Australis) seem\r\nto be here referred to.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Pisces, the Fishes, is the last of the \"signs of the\r\nZodiac.\" The Fishes appear on an ancient Greek obelisk described by\r\nPococke. Among the Greeks this sign was consecrated to Venus; and in Egypt\r\nto Nepthys, wife of Typhon and goddess of the sea. Pisces is said to end\r\nthe Zodiac as the Mediterranean Sea terminated Egypt. This idea was\r\nsuggested by Schmidt, who also conjectured that the Ram (Aries) was placed\r\nat the beginning of the Zodiac because Thebes, a town sacred to Jupiter\r\nAmmon, was at the beginning of Egypt in ancient times; and he thought that\r\nthe constellation Triangulum, the Triangle, represented the Nile Delta,\r\nEridanus being the Nile.[427] The constellation was represented in ancient\r\ntimes by two fishes connected by a cord tied to their tails. The southern\r\nof these \"fishes\" lies south of the \"Square of Pegasus,\" and the northern\r\nbetween Andromeda and Aries. According to Manilius, the origin of these\r\nfishes is as follows: Venus, seeing Typhon on the banks of the river\r\nEuphrates, cast herself with her son into the river and they were\r\ntransformed into fishes!\r\n\r\nSome of the Arabians substituted a swallow for the northern of the two\r\nfishes--the one below Andromeda. The swallow was a symbol of Spring.\r\nAccording to Dupuis, Pisces represents the 8th \"labour of Hercules,\" his\r\ntriumph over the mares of Diomed which emitted fire from their\r\nnostrils.[428] But the connection between fishes and mares is not obvious,\r\nand some of Dupuis' ideas seem very fanciful. Here he seems to have found\r\na \"mare's nest.\"\r\n\r\nThe constellation Cetus, the Whale, represents, according to ancient\r\nwriters, the sea monster sent by Neptune to devour Andromeda when she was\r\nchained to the rock. Aratus calls Cetus the \"dusky monster,\" and Brown\r\nremarks that \"the 'Dusky Star' would be peculiarly appropriate to Mira\r\n(the wondrous [Greek: o] Ceti).\"[429] Cetus was also called Canis\r\nTritonis, or Dog of the Sea, Bayer in his Atlas (1603) shows a dragon\r\ninstead of a whale, finding it so represented on some ancient spheres.\r\nAl-Sufi calls it Kîtus or [Greek: kêtos], the whale. He says, \"it is\r\nrepresented by the figure of a marine animal, of which the fore part is\r\nturned towards the east, to the south of the Ram, and the hinder part\r\ntowards the west behind the three 'extern' stars of Aquarius.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi does not mention the variable star [Greek: o] Ceti, now called\r\nMira, or the \"wonderful,\" nor does he refer to any star in its immediate\r\nvicinity. We may, therefore, conclude that it was near a minimum of light\r\nat the time of his observation of the stars of Cetus.\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Orion, one of the finest in the heavens, was called\r\nby Al-Sufi _al-djabbar_, \"the Giant,\" and also _al-djauza_, \"the Spouse.\"\r\nThe poet Longfellow says--\r\n\r\n  \"Sirius was rising in the east\r\n  And, slow ascending one by one,\r\n  The kindling constellations shone\r\n  Begirt with many a blazing star\r\n  Stood the great giant Al-gebar\r\n  Orion, hunter of the beast!\r\n  His sword hung gleaming at his side\r\n  And on his arm, the lion's hide--\r\n  Scattered across the midnight air\r\n  The golden radiance of its hair.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi says it \"is represented by the figure of a standing man, to the\r\nsouth of the sun's path. This constellation very much resembles a human\r\nfigure with a head and two shoulders. It is called _al-djabbar_, 'the\r\nGiant,' because it has two thrones, holds a club in his hand, and is\r\ngirded with a sword.\" Orion is supposed to have been a son of Neptune;\r\nbut there are many stories of the origin of the name. It is also said to\r\nbe derived from the Greek word [Greek: ôra], because the constellation was\r\nused to mark the different times of the year. According to the ancient\r\nfable, Orion was killed by a scorpion, and was placed in the sky at the\r\nrequest of Diana. According to Houzeau, the name comes from _oriri_, to be\r\nborn. Scorpio rises when Orion sets, and he thinks that the idea of the\r\nancients was that the Scorpion in this way kills the giant Orion.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt Orion was called _Sahu_. This name occurs on the\r\nmonuments of the Ptolemies, and also on those of the Pharaohs. It is also\r\nmentioned in the _Book of the Dead_. It seems to have been considered of\r\ngreat importance in ancient Egypt, as its heliacal rising announced that\r\nof Sirius, which heralded the annual rising of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Eridanus lies south of Taurus, east of Cetus, and west\r\nof Lepus. In ancient times it was supposed to represent the Nile or the\r\nPo. Ptolemy merely calls it [Greek: Potamou asterismos], or asterism of\r\nthe river. It was called Eridanus by the Greeks, and Fluvius by the\r\nRomans. It appears to correspond with the Hebrew Shicor. Al-Sufi calls it\r\n_al-nahr_, \"the River.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting points in Al-Sufi's most interesting work is\r\nthe identity of the bright star known to the ancient astronomers as\r\n_achir al-nahr_, \"the End of the River,\" and called by Ptolemy [Greek:\r\nEschatos tou potamou], \"the Last in the River.\" Some astronomers have\r\nidentified this star with [Greek: a] Eridani (Achernar), a bright southern\r\nstar of the 1st magnitude, south of Eridanus. But Al-Sufi's description\r\nshows clearly that the star he refers to is really [Greek: th] Eridani;\r\nand the reader will find it interesting to follow his description with a\r\nstar map before him. Describing Ptolemy's 34th star of Eridanus (the star\r\nin question), he says, \"the 34th star is found before [that is west of]\r\nthese three stars [the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd, which are [Greek: u]{2}, Du,\r\nand [Greek: u]' in Proctor's Atlas], the distance between it and that of\r\nthe three which is nearest being about 4 cubits [9° 20']. It is of the\r\nfirst magnitude; it is that which is marked on the southern astrolabe, and\r\ncalled _achir al-nahr_, 'the End of the River.' There are before this\r\nbright one two stars, one to the south, [[Greek: s] Eridani, not shown in\r\nProctor's small Atlas], the other to the north [[Greek: i] Eridani];\r\nPtolemy does not mention these. One of these stars is of the 4th\r\nmagnitude, the other of the 5th. There is behind the same [that is, east\r\nof it] a star of the 4th magnitude distant from it two cubits [[Greek: e]\r\nEridani]. To the south of the three stars which follow the bright one\r\nthere are some stars of the 4th and 5th magnitudes, which he [Ptolemy] has\r\nnot mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nNow, a glance at a star map of this region will show clearly that the\r\nbright star referred to by Al-Sufi is undoubtedly [Greek: th] Eridani,\r\nwhich is therefore the star known to the ancients as the \"End of the\r\nRiver,\" or the \"Last in the River.\"\r\n\r\nThe position given by Ptolemy agrees fairly well with Al-Sufi's\r\ndescription, although the place is slightly erroneous, as is also the case\r\nwith Fomalhaut and [Greek: b] Centauri. It is impossible to suppose that\r\neither Ptolemy or Al-Sufi could have seen [Greek: a] Eridani, as it is too\r\nfar south to be visible from their stations, and, owing to the precession\r\nof the equinoxes, the star was still further south in ancient times.\r\nAl-Sufi says distinctly that the distance between Ptolemy's 33rd star\r\n(which is undoubtedly _h_ Eridani, or Proctor's [Greek: u]') and the 34th\r\nstar was \"4 cubits,\" or 9° 20'. The actual distance is about 9° 11', so\r\nthat Al-Sufi's estimate was practically correct. Halley, in his _Catalogus\r\nStellarium Australium_, identifies Ptolemy's star with [Greek: th]\r\nEridani, and Baily agreed with him.[430] Ulugh Beigh also identifies the\r\n\"Last in the River\" with [Greek: th] Eridani. The Arabic observer Mohammed\r\nAli Achsasi, who observed in the seventeenth century, called [Greek: th]\r\nEridani _Achr al-nahr_, and rated it first magnitude.[431] To argue, as\r\nBode and Flammarion have done, that Ptolemy and Al-Sufi may have heard of\r\n[Greek: a] Eridani from travellers in the southern hemisphere, is to beg\r\nthe whole question at issue. This is especially true with reference to\r\nAl-Sufi, who says, in the preface to his work, that he has described the\r\nstars \"as seen with my own eyes.\" [Greek: a] Eridani is over 11 \"cubits\"\r\nfrom _h_ Eridani instead of \"4 cubits\" as Al-Sufi says. This shows\r\nconclusively that the star seen by Al-Sufi was certainly _not_ [Greek: a]\r\nEridani. The interest of the identification is that Al-Sufi rated [Greek:\r\nth] Eridani of the _first_ magnitude, whereas it is now only 3rd\r\nmagnitude! It was measured 3·06 at Harvard and estimated 3·4 by Stanley\r\nWilliams, so that it has evidently diminished greatly in brightness since\r\nAl-Sufi's time. There is an interesting paper on this subject by Dr.\r\nAnderson (the discoverer of Nova Aurigæ and Nova Persei) in _Knowledge_\r\nfor July, 1893, in which he states that the \"Last in the River,\" according\r\nto the statements of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, _did_ rise above their\r\nhorizon at a certain time of the year, which [Greek: a] Eridani could not\r\npossibly have done. This seems sufficient to settle the question in favour\r\nof [Greek: th] Eridani. Dr. Anderson says, \"It is much to be regretted\r\nthat Professor Schjellerup, the able and industrious translator of Sufi,\r\nhas allowed this to escape his notice, and helped in the preface and note\r\nto his work to propagate the delusion that [Greek: a] Eridani is Ptolemy's\r\n'Last in the River'\"; and in this opinion I fully concur. Al-Sufi's clear\r\naccount places it beyond a doubt that the star known to Hipparchus,\r\nPtolemy, Al-Sufi, and Ulugh Beigh as the \"Last in the River\" was [Greek:\r\nth] Eridani. [Greek: th] must have diminished greatly in brightness since\r\nAl-Sufi's time, for in ranking it as 1st magnitude he placed it in a very\r\nselect list. He only rated thirteen stars in the whole heavens as being of\r\nthe 1st magnitude. These are: Arcturus, Vega, Capella, Aldebaran, Regulus,\r\n[Greek: b] Leonis, Fomalhaut, Rigel, [Greek: th] Eridani, Sirius, Procyon,\r\nCanopus, and [Greek: a] Centauri. _All_ these stars were actually _seen_\r\nby Al-Sufi, _and described from his own observations_. He does not mention\r\n[Greek: a] Eridani, as it was not visible from his station in Persia.\r\n\r\n[Greek: th] Eridani is a splendid double star (3·40, 4·49: 8\"·38, 1902,\r\nTebbutt). I found the components white and light yellow with 3-inch\r\nrefractor in the Punjab. Dr. Gould thinks that one of the components is\r\nvariable to some extent. This is interesting, considering the brilliancy\r\nof the star in Al-Sufi's time. The brighter component was found to be a\r\nspectroscopic binary by Wright, so that on the whole the star is a most\r\ninteresting object.\r\n\r\nThe small constellation Lepus, the Hare, lies south of Orion. Pliny calls\r\nit Dasypus, and Virgil Auritus. In ancient Egypt it was the symbol of\r\nvigilance, prudence, fear, solitude, and speed.[432] It may perhaps\r\nrepresent the hare hunted by Orion; but some say it was placed in the sky\r\nto commemorate a terrible plague of hares which occurred in Sicily in\r\nancient times.\r\n\r\nA little north-west of the star [Greek: m] Leporis is Hind's \"crimson\r\nstar\" (R.A. 4{h} 53{m}, S. 14° 57', 1900) described by him as \"of the most\r\nintense crimson, resembling a blood drop on the background of the sky; as\r\nregards depth of colour, no other star visible in these latitudes could be\r\ncompared with it.\" It is variable from about the 6th to the 8th magnitude,\r\nwith a period of about 436 days from maximum to maximum.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Canis Major, the Great Dog, is remarkable for containing\r\nSirius, the brightest star in the heavens. In the Greek mythology it was\r\nsupposed to represent a dog given by Aurora to Cephalus as the swiftest of\r\nall dogs. Cephalus wished to match it against a fox which he thought\r\nsurpassed all animals for speed. They both ran for so long a time, so the\r\nstory goes, that Jupiter rewarded the dog by placing it among the stars.\r\nBut probably the dog comes from Anubis, the dog-headed god of the ancient\r\nEgyptians. According to Brown, Theogirius (B.C. 544) refers to the\r\nconstellation of the Dog.[433] He thinks that Canis Major is probably \"a\r\nreduplication\" of Orion; Sirius and [Greek: b] Canis Majoris corresponding\r\nto [Greek: a] and [Greek: g] Orionis; [Greek: d], 22, and [Greek: e] Canis\r\nMajoris to the stars in Orion's belt ([Greek: d, e], and [Greek: z]\r\nOrionis); and [Greek: ê]; and [Greek: k] Canis Majoris with [Greek: k] and\r\n[Greek: b] Orionis.[434]\r\n\r\nThe Arabic name of Sirius was _al-schira_, which might easily be corrupted\r\ninto Sirius. The Hebrew name was Sihor. According to Plutarch, the\r\nEthiopians paid regal honours to the Celestial Dog. The Romans used to\r\nsacrifice a dog in its honour at the fetes called Robigalia, which were\r\nheld on the seventh day before the Calends of May, and nine days after the\r\nentry of the sun into Taurus. Pliny says, \"Hoc tempus Varro determinat\r\nsole decimam partem Tauri obtinenti quod canis occidit, sidus per se\r\nvehemens,\" etc.[435]\r\n\r\nOwing to some remarks of Cicero, Horace, and Seneca, it has been supposed\r\nthat in ancient times Sirius was of red colour. Seneca says, \"Nec mirum\r\nest, si terra omnis generis et varia evaporatio est; quam in coelo\r\nquoque non unus appareat color rerum, sed acrior sit Caniculæ rubor,\r\nNartis remissior, Jovis nullus, in lucem puram nitore perducto.\"[436] It\r\nis now brilliantly white with a bluish tinge. But this change of colour is\r\nsomewhat doubtful. The remarks of the ancient writers may possibly refer\r\nto its great brilliancy rather than its colour. Al-Sufi says nothing about\r\nits colour, and it was probably a white star in his time. If it were red\r\nin his day he would most probably have mentioned the fact, as he does in\r\nthe case of several red stars. Brown, however, quotes the following from\r\nIbn Alraqqa, an Arabian observer:--\r\n\r\n  \"I recognize Sirius _shining red_, whilst the morning is becoming white.\r\n  The night fading away, has risen and left him,\r\n  The night is not afraid to lose him, since he follows her.\"\r\n\r\nSchjellerup thinks that it is very doubtful that Sirius was really red as\r\nseen by Hipparchus and Ptolemy. But in an exhaustive inquiry made by Dr.\r\nSee on the supposed change of colour,[437] he comes to the conclusion that\r\nSirius was really red in ancient times. Seneca states distinctly that it\r\nwas redder than Mars (see extract above), and other ancient writers refer\r\nto its red colour. It has been generally supposed that the Arabian\r\nastronomer Alfraganus, in his translation of Ptolemy's _Almagest_, refers\r\nto only five red stars observed by Ptolemy, namely, Arcturus, Aldebaran,\r\nBetelgeuse, Antares, and Pollux. But Dr. See shows that this idea is due\r\nto a mistranslation of Alfraganus by Plato Tibertinus in 1537, and that\r\nPtolemy did not speak of \"five red stars,\" but five _nebulous_ stars, as\r\nstated by Christmann and Golius. Ptolemy described Sirius as [Greek:\r\nupokirros], \"fiery red,\" the same word used with reference to the other\r\nstars mentioned above. The change of colour, if any, probably took place\r\nbefore Al-Sufi's time.\r\n\r\nDr. See says--\r\n\r\n    \"Prof. Newcomb rejects the former well-authenticated redness of\r\n    Sirius, because he cannot explain the fact. But the ink was scarcely\r\n    dry on his new book on the stars, in which he takes this position,\r\n    when Nova Persei blazed forth in 1901; and observers saw it change\r\n    colour from day to day and week to week. Could any one explain the\r\n    cause of these numerous and conspicuous changes of colour? Shall we,\r\n    then, deny the changes of colour in Nova Persei, some of which were\r\n    noticed when it was nearly as bright as Sirius?\"[438]\r\n\r\nOn the ceiling of the Memnonium at Thebes the heliacal rising of Sirius is\r\nrepresented under the form and name of Isis. The coincidence of this\r\nrising with the annual rising of the Nile is mentioned by Tibullus and\r\nAclian. About 4000 B.C. the heliacal rising of Sirius coincided with the\r\nsummer solstice (about June 21) and the beginning of the rising of the\r\nNile. The festival in honour of this event was held by the Egyptians about\r\nJuly 20, and this marked the beginning of the sacred Egyptian year. On the\r\nsummit of Mount Pelion in Thessaly there was a temple dedicated to Zeus,\r\nwhere sacrifices were offered at the rising of Sirius by men of rank who\r\nwere chosen for the purpose by the priests and wore fresh sheepskins.\r\n\r\nSirius seems to have been worshipped by the ancient Egyptians under the\r\nname of Sothis, and it was regarded as the star of Isis and Osiris. The\r\nlast name without the initial O very much resembles our modern name.\r\n\r\nAccording to Al-Sufi, the Arabians called Sirius _al-schira al-abûr_,\r\n\"Sirius which has passed across,\" also _al-schira al Jamânija_, \"the\r\nSirius of Yémen.\" He says it is called _al-abûr_, \"because it has passed\r\nacross the Milky Way into the southern region.\" He relates a mythological\r\nstory why Sirius \"fled towards the south\" and passed across the Milky Way\r\ntowards Suhail (Canopus). The same story is told by Albufaragius[439]\r\n(thirteenth century). (The story was probably derived from Al-Sufi.) Now,\r\nit seems to me a curious and interesting fact that the large proper motion\r\nof Sirius would have carried it across the Milky Way from the eastern to\r\nthe western border in a period of 60,000 years. Possibly the Arabian story\r\nmay be based on a tradition of Sirius having been seen on the opposite, or\r\neastern, side of the Milky Way by the men of the early Stone Age. However\r\nthis may be, we know from the amount and direction of the star's proper\r\nmotion that it must have passed across the Milky Way from east to west\r\nwithin the period above stated. The Arabic name _al-abûr_ is not,\r\ntherefore, a merely fanciful one, but denotes an _actual fact_. The\r\nproper motion of Sirius could not possibly have been known to the\r\nancients, as it was only revealed by accurate modern observations.\r\n\r\nThe little constellation Canis Minor, the Little Dog, lies south of Gemini\r\nand Cancer. Small as it is, it was one of the original forty-eight\r\nconstellations of Ptolemy. In the Greek mythology it was supposed to\r\nrepresent either one of Diana's hunting dogs, or one of Orion's hounds.\r\nOvid calls it the dog of Icarus. Others say it was the dog of Helen, who\r\nwas carried off by Paris. According to the old poets, Orion's dog, or the\r\ndog of Icarus, threw himself into a well after seeing his master perish.\r\nThe name Fovea, given to the constellation by Bayer, signifies a pit where\r\ncorn was deposited. This comes from the fact that the rising of the star\r\nProcyon ([Greek: a] Canis Minoris) indicated the season of abundance. But\r\nLalande thought it more probable that the idea of a pit came from the\r\nGreek [Greek: seiros], which means a corn store, and that it was\r\nconfounded with Sirius.\r\n\r\nThe name of the bright star Procyon ([Greek: a] Canis Minoris) is derived\r\nfrom the Greek [Greek: prokuôn], \"the advanced day,\" because it appeared\r\nin the morning sky before Sirius. Procyon was called by the Hindoos\r\nHanouman after their famous monkey god, from whose tail a bridge is said\r\nto have been formed to enable the army of Rama to pass from India to\r\nCeylon. Al-Sufi says that the star was marked on the old astrolabes as\r\n_al-schira al-schamia_, \"the Syrian Sirius.\" It was also called, he says,\r\n_al-schira al-gumaisa_, \"the Sirius with blear eyes\" (!) from weeping\r\nbecause Sirius had passed across the Milky Way, Procyon remaining on the\r\neastern side. Here we have the same legend again. The proper motion of\r\nProcyon (about the same in amount and direction as that of Sirius) shows\r\nthat the star has been on the eastern side of the Milky Way for many ages\r\npast. About 60,000 years hence, Procyon will be near the star [Greek: th]\r\nCanis Majoris, and will then--like Sirius--have passed across the Milky\r\nWay.\r\n\r\nArgo, the Ship, is a large constellation south of Hydra, Monoceros, and\r\nCanis Major. It is called by Al-Sufi _al-safîna_, \"the Ship.\" It is\r\nsupposed to represent the first ship ever built. The name is derived from\r\nthe builder Argo, or from the Greek word [Greek: Argos]. This ship is said\r\nto have been built in Thessaly by order of Minerva and Neptune, to go on\r\nthe expedition for the conquest of the golden fleece. The date of this\r\nexpedition, commanded by Jason, is usually fixed at 1300 or 1400 B.C. With\r\nreference to the position of this supposed ship in the sky, Proctor says,\r\n\"It is noteworthy that when we make due correction for the effects of\r\nprecession during the past 4000 years, the old constellation Argo is set\r\non an even keel, instead of being tilted some 45° to the horizon, as at\r\npresent when due south.\" He connects Argo with Noah's Ark.\r\n\r\nThe brightest star of Argo is Canopus, called Suhaïl by Al-Sufi. It is the\r\nsecond brightest star in the heavens; but it is not visible in northern\r\nlatitudes. The Harvard photometric measures make it nearly one magnitude\r\nbrighter than the zero magnitude, about two magnitudes brighter than\r\nAldebaran, and about half the brightness of Sirius. This fine star has\r\nbeen suspected of variable light. Webb says, \"It was thought (1861) in\r\nChili brighter than Sirius.\" Observing it in the Punjab, the present\r\nwriter found it on several occasions but little inferior to Sirius,\r\nalthough very low on the southern horizon. From recent observations by Mr.\r\nH. C. McKay in Australia, he believes that it is variable to the extent of\r\nat least half a magnitude.[440] But it is difficult to establish\r\nvariations of light in very bright stars. The parallax of Canopus is\r\n_very_ small, so its distance from the earth is very great, and it must be\r\na sun of gigantic size. According to Al-Fargani, Canopus was called the\r\nstar of St. Catherine by the Christian pilgrims in the tenth century.[441]\r\nIt was called Suhaïl by the old Arabians, a name apparently derived from\r\nthe root _sahl_, \"a plain\"; and Schjellerup suggests that the name was\r\nprobably applied to this and some other southern stars because they seem\r\nto move along a plain near the southern horizon. Al-Sufi says that he\r\nmeasured the latitude of Schiraz in Persia, where he observed, and found\r\nit to be 29° 36'; and hence for that place Canopus, when on the meridian,\r\nhad an altitude of about 9°. Canopus was the ancient name of Aboukir in\r\nEgypt, and is said to have derived its name from the pilot of Menelaus,\r\nwhose name was Kanobus, and who died there from the bite of a snake. The\r\nstar is supposed to have been named after him, and it was worshipped by\r\nthe ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi does not mention the famous variable star [Greek: ê] Argûs, which,\r\nowing to the precession of the equinoxes, he might possibly have seen\r\n_close to the horizon_, if it had been a bright star in his day. It lies\r\nbetween [Greek: ph] Velorum and [Greek: a] Crucis. Both of these stars are\r\nmentioned by Al-Sufi, but he says nothing of any bright star (or indeed\r\nany star) between them. This negative evidence tends to show that [Greek:\r\nê] Argûs was not visible to the naked eye in Al-Sufi's time. This\r\nextraordinary star has in modern times varied through all degrees of\r\nbrightness from Sirius down to the 8th magnitude! Schönfeld thought that a\r\nregular period is very improbable. It seems to be a sort of connecting\r\nlink between the long period variables and the _novæ_ or temporary stars.\r\nIt is reddish in colour, and the spectrum of its light is very similar to\r\nthat of the temporary stars. Whether it will ever become a brilliant\r\nobject again, time alone can tell; but from the fact that it was\r\npresumably faint in Al-Sufi's time, and afterwards increased to the\r\nbrightness of Sirius, it seems possible that its light may again revive.\r\n\r\nThe long constellation Hydra lies south of Cancer, Leo, Crater, Corvus,\r\nVirgo, and Libra. It was also called Asina, Coluber, Anguis, Sublimatus,\r\netc. In the Greek mythology it was supposed to represent the Lernæan\r\nserpent killed by Hercules. According to Ovid, who fixed its acronycal\r\nrising for February 14, it had a common origin with Corvus and Crater.\r\nApollo, wishing to sacrifice to Jupiter, sent the Crow with a cup to fetch\r\nwater. On his way to the well the Crow stopped at a fig tree and waited\r\nfor the fruit to ripen! Afterwards, to excuse his delay, he said that a\r\nserpent had prevented him from drawing the water. But Apollo, to punish\r\nthe Crow for his deception, changed his plumage from white to black, and\r\nordered the serpent to prevent the Crow from drinking.[442] Hydra was\r\ncalled by Al-Sufi _al-schudja_, \"the Serpent, or Hydra.\" He says that \"it\r\ncontains twenty-five stars in the figure and two 'outside', and its head\r\nis to the south of the southern scale of the Balance\" ([Greek: a] Libræ).\r\nBut this is clearly a mistake (one of the very few errors to be found in\r\nAl-Sufi's work), for he goes on to say that the head is composed of four\r\nstars forming a figure like the head of a horse, and he adds, \"This head\r\nis in the middle between _al-shira al-gumaisa_ [Procyon] and _Kalb\r\nal-asad_ [Regulus] the Heart, inclining from these two stars a little to\r\nthe south.\" This clearly indicates the stars [Greek: d, e, ê], and [Greek:\r\ns] Hydræ which, with [Greek: z] Hydræ, have always been considered as\r\nforming the Hydra's head. These stars lie south of [Greek: a] and [Greek:\r\nb] Cancri, not south of Libra as Al-Sufi says (doubtless by a slip of the\r\npen).\r\n\r\nPtolemy's 12th star of Hydra ([Greek: a] Hydræ) is, Al-Sufi says, \"the\r\nbright red star which is found at the end of the neck where the back\r\nbegins; it is of the 2nd magnitude. It is that which is marked on the\r\nastrolabe as _unk al-schudja_, 'the neck of the serpent,' also _al-fard_,\r\n'the solitary one.'\" Al-Sufi's estimate of its brightness agrees well with\r\nmodern measures; but it has been suspected of variable light. Sir John\r\nHerschel's estimates at the Cape of Good Hope varied from 1·75 to 2·58\r\nmagnitude. He thought that its apparent variation might be due to its\r\nreddish colour, and compares it to the case of [Greek: a] Cassiopeiæ. But\r\nas this latter star is now _known_ to be irregularly variable it seems\r\nprobable that [Greek: a] Hydræ may be variable also. Gemmill found it\r\nremarkably bright on May 9, 1883, when he thought it nearly equal to\r\nPollux (1·2 magnitude). On the other hand, Franks thought it nearer the\r\n3rd than the 2nd magnitude on March 2, 1878. On April 9, 1884, the\r\npresent writer found it only slightly less than Regulus (1·3 magnitude).\r\nOn April 6, 1886, how-ever, it was considerably less than Regulus, but\r\nhalf a magnitude brighter than [Greek: b] Canis Minoris, or about 2-1/2\r\nmagnitude. In the Chinese Annals it is called the \"Red Bird.\" In a list of\r\nthirty stars found on a tablet at Birs-Nimroud, it is called \"The son of\r\nthe supreme temple.\" Although to the naked eye deserving the name of\r\nAlphard or \"the solitary one,\" it is by no means an isolated star when\r\nexamined with a telescope. It has a faint and distant companion, observed\r\nby Admiral Smyth; and about 25' to the west of it Ward saw a small double\r\nstar (8, 13: 90°: 50\"). With a 3-inch refractor in the Punjab, I saw a\r\nsmall star of about 8-1/2 magnitude to the south and a little east of the\r\nbright star, probably identical with Smyth's companion. Farther off in the\r\nsame direction I saw a fainter star, and others at greater distances in\r\nthe field. There is also a faint star a little to the north. I also saw\r\nWard's double with the 3-inch telescope.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in identifying the stars numbered by Ptolemy 13,\r\n14, and 15 in Hydra. Having plotted a map from Ptolemy's positions (as\r\ngiven by Al-Sufi), I have come to the conclusion that Ptolemy's stars are\r\n13 = [Greek: k] Hydræ; 14 = [Greek: u]; and 15 = [Greek: l] Hydræ,\r\nprobably. From the clear description given by Al-Sufi of the stars\r\nobserved by _him_, I find that _his_ stars are 13 = [Greek: u]_{1}; 14 =\r\n[Greek: u]_{2}; and 15 = [Greek: l] Hydræ. We must, therefore, conclude\r\nthat Ptolemy and Al-Sufi saw only three stars where now there are\r\nfour,[443] and that [Greek: k] Hydræ was not seen, or at least is not\r\nmentioned by Al-Sufi. [Greek: k] is, therefore, probably variable. It was\r\nrated 4 by Tycho Brahé, Bayer, and Hevelius; it is at present about 5th\r\nmagnitude. If Ptolemy did not see [Greek: u]_{2} it is probably variable\r\nalso, and, indeed, it has been suspected of variable light.[444]\r\n\r\nThe small constellation of Crater, the Cup, lies north of Hydra, and south\r\nof Leo and Virgo. Al-Sufi calls it _al-batija_, \"the Jar, or Cup.\" He says\r\nthe Arabians called it _al-malif_, \"the Crib, or Manger.\" According to\r\nBrown, the stars of Crater exactly form a Bakhian [Greek: kantharos], with\r\nits two handles rising above the two extremities of the\r\ncircumference.[445] An Asia Minor legend \"connected Crater with the mixing\r\nof human blood with wine in a bowl.\" Crater is referred to by Ovid in the\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n  \"Dixit et antiqui monumenta perennia facti\r\n  Anguis, Avis, Crater sidera, juncta micunt.\"\r\n\r\nThe star [Greek: a] Crateris was rated 4th magnitude by Al-Sufi and all\r\nother observers, and the Harvard measures make it 4·20, a satisfactory\r\nagreement. It has three companions noted by Admiral Smyth. One of these he\r\ncalled \"intense blood colour.\" This is R Crateris, now known to be\r\nvariable from above the 8th magnitude to below the 9th. Sir John Herschel\r\ncalled it an \"intense scarlet star, a curious colour.\" With 3-inch\r\nrefractor in the Punjab I found it \"full scarlet.\" It is one of an open\r\npair, the further of the two from [Greek: a]. There is a third star about\r\n9th magnitude a little south of it. Ward saw a 13th magnitude star between\r\n[Greek: a] and R with a 2-7/8-inch (Wray) refractor. This I saw \"readily\"\r\nwith my 3-inch. Smyth does not mention this faint star, although he used a\r\nmuch larger telescope.\r\n\r\nCorvus, the Crow, is a small constellation, north of Hydra. Aratus says\r\n\"the Crow form seems to peck the fold of the water snake\" (Hydra). The\r\nvictory which Valerius Corvinus is said to have owed to a crow has given\r\nit the name of Pomptina, because the victory took place near the Pontine\r\nmarshes.[446] A quadrilateral figure is formed by its four brightest\r\nstars, [Greek: g, d, b], and [Greek: e] Corvi. This figure has sometimes\r\nbeen mistaken for the Southern Cross by those who are not familiar with\r\nthe heavens. But the stars of the Southern Cross are much brighter.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Centaurus, the Centaur, lies south of Hydra and Libra,\r\nand north of the Southern Cross. According to Dupuis, Centaurus represents\r\nthe 3rd \"labour of Hercules,\" his triumph over the Centaurs.[447] The\r\nCentaurs were supposed to be a people living in the vicinity of Mount\r\nOssa, who first rode on horses. The constellation was also called Semivir,\r\nChiron, Phobos, Minotaurus, etc. Al-Sufi says it \"is represented by the\r\nfigure of an animal, of which the forepart is the upper part of a man from\r\nthe head to end of the back, and its hinder part is the hinder part of a\r\nhorse, from the beginning of the back to the tail. It is to the south of\r\nthe Balance [Libra] turning its face towards the east, and the hinder part\r\nof the beast towards the west.\"\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi describes very clearly the four bright stars of the famous\r\n\"Southern Cross.\" Owing to precession these stars were some 7° further\r\nnorth in the tenth century than they are at present, and they could have\r\nbeen all seen by Al-Sufi, when on the meridian. In the time of Ptolemy and\r\nHipparchus, they were still further north, and about 5000 years ago they\r\nwere visible in the latitude of London. Dante speaks of these four stars\r\nas emblematical of the four cardinal virtues, Justice, Temperance,\r\nFortitude, and Prudence.\r\n\r\nClosely south-east of [Greek: a] and [Greek: b] Crucis is the dark spot in\r\nthe Milky Way known as the \"Coal Sack,\" which forms such a conspicuous\r\nobject near the Southern Cross. It was first described by Pinzon in 1499;\r\nand afterwards by Lacaille in 1755. Although to the naked eye apparently\r\nblack, photographs show that it contains many faint stars, but, of course,\r\nmuch less numerous than in the surrounding regions. The dark effect is\r\nchiefly caused by contrast with the brilliancy of the Milky Way\r\nsurrounding it.\r\n\r\nAl-Sufi also mentions the bright stars [Greek: a] and [Greek: b] Centauri\r\nwhich follow the Southern Cross. He says that the distance between them\r\n\"is four cubits,\" that is about 9° 20', but it is less than this now.\r\n[Greek: a] has a large \"proper motion\" of 3\"·67 per annum, and was farther\r\nfrom [Greek: b] in Al-Sufi's time than it is at present. This, however,\r\nwould not _wholly_ account for the difference, and Al-Sufi's over-estimate\r\nis probably due to the well-known effect by which the distance between two\r\nstars is _apparently_ increased when they are near the horizon. Several of\r\nAl-Sufi's distances between southern stars are over-estimated, probably\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Lupus, the Wolf, is south of Libra and Scorpio. It lies\r\nalong the western border of the Milky Way. According to ancient writers it\r\nrepresents Lycaon, King of Arcadia, a contemporary of Cecrops, who is said\r\nto have sacrificed human victims, and on account of his cruelty was\r\nchanged into a wolf. Another fable is that it represents a wolf\r\nsacrificed by the Centaur Chiron. According to Brown, Lupus appears on the\r\nEuphratian planisphere discovered by George Smyth in the palace of\r\nSennacherib. Al-Sufi called it _al-sabu_, \"the Wild Beast.\" It was also\r\ncalled _al-fand_, \"the Leopard,\" and _al-asada_, \"the Lioness.\"\r\n\r\nAra, the Altar, lies south of Scorpio. According to ancient writers it\r\nrepresents an altar built by Vulcan, when the gods made war against the\r\nTitans. It is called by Al-Sufi _al-midjman_, \"the Scent Box,\" or \"the\r\nAltar.\"\r\n\r\nThe little constellation Corona Australis, the Southern Crown, lies south\r\nand west of Sagittarius, east of Scorpio, and west of Telescopium. Aratus\r\nrefers to the stars in Corona Australis as--\r\n\r\n                          \"Other few\r\n  Before the Archer under his forefeet\r\n  Led round in circle roll without a name.\"[449]\r\n\r\nBut the constellation was known by the names Caduceus, Orbiculus, Corona\r\nSagittarii, etc. The ancient poets relate that Bacchus placed this crown\r\nin the sky in honour of his mother Semele.[450] Others say that it\r\nrepresents the crown conferred on Corinne of Thebes, famous as a poet.\r\n\r\nThe small constellation Piscis Australis, or the Southern Fish, lies\r\nsouth of Capricornus and Aquarius. In the most ancient maps it is\r\nrepresented as a fish drinking the water which flows from the urn of\r\nAquarius.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA good many constellations have been added to the heavens since the days\r\nof Al-Sufi, and notes on some of these may be of interest.\r\n\r\nCAMELOPARDALIS.--This constellation first appears on a celestial\r\nplanisphere published by Bartschius in the year 1624. It was not formed by\r\nBartschius himself, but by the navigators of the sixteenth century. It\r\nlies south of Ursa Minor, north of Perseus and Auriga, east of Draco, and\r\nwest of Cassiopeia. It contains no star brighter than the 4th magnitude.\r\n\r\nLYNX.--This constellation is south of Camelopardalis and Ursa Major, and\r\nnorth of Gemini and Cancer. It was formed by Hevelius in 1660, and he\r\ncalled it the Lynx, because, he said, it contained only faint stars and\r\n\"it was necessary to have the eyes of a lynx\" to see them! Some of them\r\nwere, however, observed by Ptolemy and Al-Sufi, and are mentioned by the\r\nlatter under Ursa Major.\r\n\r\nCANES VENATICI, or the Hunting Dogs.--This was formed by Hevelius in 1660.\r\nIt lies south of the Great Bear's tail, north of Coma Berenices, east of\r\nUrsa Major, and west of Boötis. Its brightest stars [Greek: a] (12) and\r\n[Greek: b] (8) were observed by Al-Sufi, and included by him in the\r\n\"extern\" stars of Ursa Major.\r\n\r\nCOMA BERENICES.--This constellation lies between Canes Venatici and Virgo.\r\nAlthough it was not included among the old forty-eight constellations of\r\nPtolemy, it is referred to by Al-Sufi as the Plat, or Tress of Hair, and\r\nhe included its stars Flamsteed 12, 15, and 21 in the \"extern\" stars of\r\nLeo. It was originally formed by the poet Callimachus in the third century\r\nB.C., but was not generally accepted until reformed by Hevelius.\r\nCallimachus lived at Alexandria in the reigns of Ptolemy Philadelphus and\r\nPtolemy Euergetes, and was chief librarian of the famous library of\r\nAlexandria from about B.C. 260 until his death in B.C. 240. Eratosthenes\r\nwas one of his pupils. The history of the constellation is as follows:\r\nBerenice, wife of Ptolemy Euergetes, made a vow, when her husband was\r\nleaving her on a military expedition, that if he returned in safety she\r\nwould cut off her hair and consecrate it in the temple of Mars. Her\r\nhusband returned, and she fulfilled her vow. But on the next day the hair\r\nhad disappeared--stolen from the temple--and Conon the mathematician\r\nshowed Ptolemy seven stars near the constellation of the Lion which did\r\nnot belong to any constellation. These were formed into a constellation\r\nand called Berenice's Hair. Conon is referred to by Catullus in the\r\nlines--\r\n\r\n  \"Idem me ille Conon coeleste numine vidit\r\n  E. Berenico vertice Cæsariem.\"\r\n\r\nComa Berenices first occurs as a distinct constellation in the catalogue\r\ncontained in the Rudolphine Tables formed by Kepler (epoch 1600) from the\r\nobservations of Tycho Brahé.[451] Bayer substituted a sheaf of corn, an\r\nidea derived from an ancient manuscript.\r\n\r\nLEO MINOR.--This small constellation lies between Ursa Major and Leo, and\r\neast of the Lynx. It was formed by Halley about the year 1660; but is\r\nreferred to by Al-Sufi, who includes one of its stars (Fl. 41) in the\r\n\"extern\" stars of Leo. There are, however, several brighter stars in the\r\ngroup. The brightest, Fl. 46, was measured 3·92 at Harvard. The star Fl.\r\n37 was called _præcipua_ (or brightest) by Tycho Brahé, and rated 3, but\r\nas it was measured only 4·77 at Harvard it may possibly have diminished in\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nSEXTANS.--This constellation lies south of Leo, and north and east of\r\nHydra. It was formed by Hevelius about the year 1680. According to the\r\nHarvard photometric measures its brightest star is Fl. 15 (4·50).\r\n\r\nMONOCEROS, or the Unicorn, lies south of Gemini and Canis Minor, north of\r\nCanis Major and Argo, east of Orion, and west of Hydra. It appears on the\r\nplanisphere of Bartschius, published in 1624. According to Scaliger it is\r\nshown on an old Persian sphere. One of its stars, Fl. 22, is mentioned by\r\nAl-Sufi among the \"extern\" stars of Canis Major (No. 1). Another, Fl. 30,\r\nis given under Hydra (\"Extern\" No. 1) and Fl. 8, 13, and 15 are apparently\r\nreferred to in Gemini. The star 15 Monocerotis is a little south of\r\n[Greek: x] Geminorum, and was measured 4·59 magnitude at Harvard. It was\r\nat one time supposed to be variable with a short period (about 3-1/2\r\ndays), but this variation has not been confirmed. The spectrum is of the\r\nfifth type--with bright lines--a very rare type among naked-eye stars. It\r\nis a triple star (5, 8·8, 11·2: 2\"·9, 16\"·3) and should be seen with a\r\n4-inch telescope. It has several other small companions, one of which\r\n(139°·2: 75\"·7) has been suspected of variation in light. It was estimated\r\n8-1/2 by Main in 1863, but only 12 by Sadler in 1875. Observing it on\r\nMarch 28, 1889, with 3-inch refractor, I found it about one magnitude\r\nbrighter than a star closely preceding, and estimated it 8 or 8-1/2\r\nmagnitude. It is probably variable and should be watched.\r\n\r\nSCUTUM SOBIESKI.--This is, or was, a small constellation in the southern\r\nportion of Aquila, which was formed by Hevelius in 1660 in honour of the\r\nPolish hero Sobieski. Its principal stars, which lie south-west of [Greek:\r\nl] Aquilæ, were mentioned by Al-Sufi and are referred to by him under that\r\nconstellation. It contains a very bright spot of Milky Way light, which\r\nmay be well seen in the month of July just below the star [Greek: l]\r\nAquilæ. Closely south of the star 6 Aquilæ is a remarkable variable star R\r\nScuti (R.A. 18{h} 42{m}·2, S. 5° 49'). It varies from 4·8 to 7·8 with an\r\nirregular period. All the light changes can be observed with a good\r\nopera-glass.\r\n\r\nVULPECULA, the Fox.--This modern constellation lies south of Cygnus, north\r\nof Sagitta and Delphinus, east of Hercules, and west of Pegasus. It was\r\nformed by Hevelius in 1660. One of its stars, 6 Vulpeculæ, is mentioned by\r\nAl-Sufi in describing the constellation Cygnus. Closely north-west of 32\r\nVulpeculæ is the short-period variable T Vulpeculæ. It varies from 5·5 to\r\n6·2 magnitude, and its period is 4·436 days. This is an interesting\r\nobject, and all the changes of light can be observed with an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nLACERTA.--This little constellation lies south of Cepheus and north of\r\nPegasus. Its formation was first suggested by Roger and Anthelm in 1679,\r\nand it was called by them \"The Sceptre and the Hand of Justice.\" It was\r\nnamed Lacerta by Hevelius in 1690, and this name it still retains. Al-Sufi\r\nseems to refer to its stars in his description of Andromeda, but does not\r\nmention any star in particular. It brightest star Fl. 7 ([Greek: a]\r\nLacertæ) is about the 4th magnitude. About one degree south-west of 7 is 5\r\nLacertæ, a deep orange star with a blue companion in a fine field.\r\n\r\nThere are some constellations south of the Equator which, although above\r\nAl-Sufi's horizon when on the meridian, are not described by him, as they\r\nwere formed since his time. These are as follows:--\r\n\r\nSCULPTOR.--This constellation lies south of Aquarius and Cetus, and north\r\nof Phoenix. Some of its stars are referred to by Al-Sufi under Eridanus\r\nas lying within the large triangle formed by [Greek: b] Ceti, Fomalhaut,\r\nand [Greek: a] Phoenicis. The brightest star is [Greek: a], about 12°\r\nsouth of [Greek: b] Ceti (4·39 magnitude Harvard). About 7° south-east of\r\n[Greek: a] is the red and variable star R Sculptoris; variable from 6·2 to\r\n8·8 magnitude, with a period of about 376 days. Gould describes it as\r\n\"intense scarlet.\" It has a spectrum of the fourth type.\r\n\r\nPHOENIX.--This constellation lies south of Sculptor. Some of its stars\r\nare referred to by Al-Sufi, under Eridanus, as forming a boat-shaped\r\nfigure. These are evidently [Greek: a, k, m, b, n], and [Greek: g].\r\n[Greek: a] is at the south-eastern angle of Al-Sufi's triangle referred to\r\nabove (under \"Sculptor\"). (See Proctor's Atlas, No. 3.)\r\n\r\nFORNAX, the Furnace, lies south of Cetus, west of Eridanus, and east of\r\nSculptor and Phoenix. It was formed by Lacaille, and is supposed to\r\nrepresent a chemical furnace with an alembic and receiver! Its brightest\r\nstar, [Greek: a] Fornacis, is identical with 12 Eridani.\r\n\r\nCÆLUM, the Sculptor's Tools, is a small constellation east of Columba, and\r\nwest of Eridanus. It was formed by Lacaille. The brightest stars are\r\n[Greek: a] and [Greek: g], which are about 4-1/2 magnitude. [Greek: a] has\r\na faint companion; and [Greek: g] is a wide double star to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nANTLIA, the Air Pump, lies south of Hydra, east and north of Argo, and\r\nwest of Centaurus. It was formed by Lacaille. It contains no star brighter\r\nthan 4th magnitude. The brightest, [Greek: a], has been variously rated\r\nfrom 4 to 5, and Stanley Williams thinks its variability \"highly\r\nprobable.\"\r\n\r\nNORMA, the Rule, lies south of Scorpio. It contains no star brighter than\r\nthe 4th magnitude.\r\n\r\nTELESCOPIUM.--This modern constellation lies south of Corona Australis,\r\nand north of Pavo. Its stars [Greek: a, d], and [Greek: z], which lie near\r\nthe northern boundary of the constellation, are referred to by Al-Sufi in\r\nhis description of Ara.\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIUM.--This small constellation is south of Capricornus, and west\r\nof Piscis Australis. Its stars seem to be referred to by Al-Sufi as having\r\nbeen seen by Ptolemy, but he does not specify their exact positions. It\r\ncontains no star brighter than 4-1/2 magnitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSouth of Al-Sufi's horizon are a number of constellations surrounding the\r\nsouth pole, which, of course, he could not see. Most of these have been\r\nformed since his time, and these will now be considered; beginning with\r\nthat immediately surrounding the South Pole (Octans), and then following\r\nthe others as nearly as possible in order of Right Ascension.\r\n\r\nOCTANS.--This is the constellation surrounding the South Pole of the\r\nheavens. There is no bright star near the Pole, the nearest visible to the\r\nnaked eye being [Greek: s] Octantis, which is within one degree of the\r\npole. It was estimated 5·8 at Cordoba. The brightest star in the\r\nconstellation is [Greek: n] Octantis ([Greek: a], Proctor), which lies\r\nabout 12 degrees from the pole in the direction of Indus and Microscopium.\r\nThe Harvard measure is 3·74 magnitude.\r\n\r\nHYDRUS, the Water-Snake, is north of Octans in the direction of Achernar\r\n([Greek: a] Eridani). The brightest star is [Greek: b], which lies close\r\nto [Greek: th] Octantis. The Harvard measure is 2·90. Gould says its\r\ncolour is \"clear yellow.\" It has a large proper motion of 2\"·28 per annum.\r\nSir David Gill found a parallax of 0\"·134, and this combined with the\r\nproper motion gives a velocity of 50 miles a second at right angles to the\r\nline of sight. [Greek: g] Hydri is a comparatively bright star of about\r\nthe 3rd magnitude, about 15-1/2 degrees from the South Pole. It is\r\nreddish, with a spectrum of the third type.\r\n\r\nHOROLOGIUM, the Clock, is north of Hydra, and south of Eridanus. Three of\r\nits stars, [Greek: a, d], and [Greek: ps], at the extreme northern end of\r\nthe constellation, seem to be referred to by Al-Sufi in his description\r\nof Eridanus, but he does not give their exact positions. Most of the stars\r\nforming this constellation were below Al-Sufi's horizon.\r\n\r\nRETICULUM, the Net, is a small constellation to the east of Hydrus and\r\nHorologium. The brightest star of the constellation is [Greek: a] (3·36\r\nHarvard, 3·3 Cordoba, and \"coloured\").\r\n\r\nDORADO, the Sword Fish, lies east of Reticulum and west of Pictor. It\r\ncontains only two stars brighter than the 4th magnitude. These are [Greek:\r\na] (3·47 Harvard) and [Greek: b] (3·81 Harvard, but suspected of\r\nvariation). About 3° east of [Greek: a] Reticuli is the variable star R\r\nDoradus. It varies from 4·8 to 6·8, and its period is about 345 days.\r\nGould calls it \"excessively red.\" It may be followed through all its\r\nfluctuations of light with an opera-glass.\r\n\r\nMENSA, or Mons Mensa, the Table Mountain, lies between Dorado and the\r\nSouth Pole, and represents the Table Mountain of the Cape of Good Hope. It\r\ncontains no star brighter than the 5th magnitude.\r\n\r\nPICTOR, the Painter's Easel, lies north of Doradus, and south of Columba.\r\nIt contains no very bright stars, the brightest being [Greek: a] (3·30\r\nHarvard).\r\n\r\nVOLANS, the Flying Fish, is north of Mensa, and south and west of Argo.\r\nIts brighter stars, with the exception of [Greek: a] and [Greek: b], form\r\nan irregular six-sided figure. Its brightest star is [Greek: b] (3·65)\r\naccording to the Harvard measures. The Cordoba estimates, however, range\r\nfrom 3·6 to 4·4, and Gould says its colour is \"bright yellow.\" Williams\r\nrated it 3·8.\r\n\r\nCHAMÆLION.--This small constellation lies south of Volans, and north of\r\nMensa and Octans. None of its stars are brighter than the 4th magnitude,\r\nits brightest being [Greek: a] (4·08 Harvard) and [Greek: g] (4·10).\r\n\r\nARGO.--This large constellation extends much further south than Al-Sufi\r\ncould follow it. The most southern star he mentions is [Greek: e] Carinæ,\r\nbut south of this are several bright stars. [Greek: b] Carinæ is 1·80\r\naccording to the Harvard measures; [Greek: u] Carinæ, 3·08; [Greek: th],\r\n3·03; [Greek: ô], 3·56; and others. A little north-west of [Greek: i] is\r\nthe long-period variable R Carinæ (9{h} 29{m}·7, S. 62° 21', 1900). It\r\nvaries from 4·5 at maximum to 10 at minimum, and the period is about 309·7\r\ndays. A little east of R Carinæ is another remarkable variable star, _l_\r\nCarinæ (R.A. 9{h} 42{m}·5, S. 62° 3'). It varies from 3·6 to 5·0\r\nmagnitude, with a period of 35-1/2 days from maximum to maximum. All the\r\nlight changes can be observed with an opera-glass, or even with the naked\r\neye. It was discovered at Cordoba. The spectrum is of the solar type (G).\r\n\r\nMUSCA, the Bee, is a small constellation south of the Southern Cross and\r\nCentaurus. Its brightest stars are [Greek: a] (2·84 Harvard) and [Greek:\r\nb] (3·26). These two stars form a fine pair south of [Greek: a] Crucis.\r\nClosely south-east of [Greek: a] is the short-period variable R Muscæ. It\r\nvaries from 6·5 to 7·6 magnitude, and its period is about 19 hours. All\r\nits changes of light may be observed with a good opera-glass.\r\n\r\nAPUS, the Bird of Paradise, lies south-east of Musca, and north of Octans.\r\nIts brightest star is [Greek: a], about the 4th magnitude. Williams calls\r\nit \"deep yellow.\" About 3° north-west of [Greek: a], in the direction of\r\nthe Southern Cross, is [Greek: th] Apodis, which was found to be variable\r\nat Cordoba from 5-1/2 to 6-1/2. The spectrum is of the third type, which\r\nincludes so many variable stars.\r\n\r\nTRIANGULUM AUSTRALIS, the Southern Triangle, is a small constellation\r\nnorth of Apus, and south of Norma. A fine triangle, nearly isosceles, is\r\nformed by its three bright stars, [Greek: a, b, g], the brightest [Greek:\r\na] being at the vertex. These three stars form with [Greek: a] Centauri an\r\nelongated cross. The stars [Greek: b] and [Greek: g] are about 3rd\r\nmagnitude. [Greek: b] is reddish. [Greek: e] (4·11, Harvard) is also\r\nreddish, and is nearly midway between [Greek: b] and [Greek: g], and near\r\nthe centre of the cross above referred to. [Greek: a] is a fine star (1·88\r\nHarvard) and is one of the brightest stars in the sky--No. 33 in a list of\r\n1500 highest stars given by Pickering. About 1° 40' west of [Greek: e] is\r\nthe short-period variable R Trianguli Australis (R.A. 15{h} 10{m}·8, S.\r\n66° 8') discovered at Cordoba in 1871. It varies from 6·7 to 7·4, and the\r\nperiod is about 3{d} 7{h}·2. Although not visible to ordinary eyesight it\r\nis given here, as it is an interesting object and all its light changes\r\nmay be well seen with an opera-glass. A little south-east of [Greek: b] is\r\nanother short-period variable, S Trianguli Australis (R.A. 15{h} 52{m}·2,\r\nS. 63° 30'), which varies from 6·4 to 7·4, with a period of 6·3 days; and\r\nall its fluctuations of light may also be observed with a good\r\nopera-glass.\r\n\r\nCIRCINUS, the Compass, is a very small constellation lying between\r\nTriangulum and Centaurus. Its brightest star, [Greek: a], is about 3-1/2\r\nmagnitude, about 4° south of [Greek: a] Centauri.\r\n\r\nPAVO, the Peacock, lies north of Octans and Apus, and south of\r\nTelescopium. Its brightest star is [Greek: a], which is a fine bright star\r\n(2·12 Harvard). [Greek: k] is a short-period variable. It varies from 3·8\r\nto 5·2, and the period is about 9 days. This is an interesting object, as\r\nall the fluctations of light can be observed by the naked eye or an\r\nopera-glass. [Greek: e] Pavonis was measured 4·10 at Harvard, but the\r\nCordoba estimates vary from 3·6 to 4·2. Gould says \"it is of a remarkably\r\nblue colour.\"\r\n\r\nINDUS.--This constellation lies north of Octans, and south of Sagittarius,\r\nMicroscopium, and Grus. One of its stars, [Greek: a], is probably referred\r\nto by Al-Sufi in his description of Sagittarius; it lies nearly midway\r\nbetween [Greek: b] Sagittarii and [Greek: a] Gruis, and is the brightest\r\nstar of the constellation. The star [Greek: e] Indi (4·74 Harvard) has a\r\nremarkably large proper motion of 4\"·68 per annum. Its parallax is about\r\n0\"·28, and the proper motion indicates a velocity of about 49 miles a\r\nsecond at right angles to the line of sight.\r\n\r\nTOUCAN.--This constellation lies north of Octans, and south of Phoenix\r\nand Grus, east of Indus, and west of Hydrus. Its brightest star is [Greek:\r\na], of about the 3rd magnitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are seven \"celestial rivers\" alluded to by the ancient\r\nastronomers:--\r\n\r\n1. The Fish River, which flows from the urn of Aquarius.\r\n\r\n2. The \"River of the Bird,\" or the Milky Way in Cygnus.\r\n\r\n3. The River of the Birds--2, including Aquila.\r\n\r\n4. The River of Orion--Eridanus.\r\n\r\n5. The River of the god Marduk--perhaps the Milky Way in Perseus.\r\n\r\n6. The River of Serpents (Serpens, or Hydra).\r\n\r\n7. The River of Gan-gal (The High Cloud)--probably the Milky Way as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThere are four serpents represented among the constellations. These are\r\nHydra, Hydrus, Serpens, and Draco.\r\n\r\nAccording to the late Mr. Proctor the date of the building of the Great\r\nPyramid was about 3400 B.C.[452] At this time the Spring Equinox was in\r\nTaurus, and this is referred to by Virgil. But this was not so in Virgil's\r\ntime, when--on account of the precession of the equinoxes--the equinoctial\r\npoint had already entered Pisces, in which constellation it still remains.\r\nAt the date 3400 B.C. the celestial equator ran along the whole length of\r\nthe constellation Hydra, nearly through Procyon, and a little north of the\r\nbright red star Antares.\r\n\r\nThe star Fomalhaut ([Greek: a] Piscis Australis) is interesting as being\r\nthe most southern 1st magnitude star visible in England, its meridian\r\naltitude at Greenwich being little more than eight degrees.[453]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Greek letters given to the brighter stars by Bayer\r\n(in his Atlas published in 1603), and now generally used by astronomers,\r\nMr. Lynn has shown that although \"Bayer did uniformly designate the\r\nbrightest stars in each constellation by the letter [Greek: a],\"[454] it\r\nis a mistake to suppose--as has often been stated in popular books on\r\nastronomy--that he added the other Greek letters _in order of brightness_.\r\nThat this is an error clearly appears from Bayer's own \"Explicatio\" to his\r\nAtlas, and was long since pointed out by Argelander (1832), and by Dr.\r\nGould in his _Uranometria Argentina_. Gould says, \"For the stars of each\r\norder, the sequence of the letters in no manner represents that of their\r\nbrightness, but depended upon the positions of the stars in the figure,\r\nbeginning usually at the head, and following its course until all the\r\nstars of that order of magnitude were exhausted.\" Mr. Lynn says, \"Perhaps\r\none of the most remarkable instances in which the lettering is seen at a\r\nglance not to follow the order of the letters is that of the three\r\nbrightest stars in Aquila [Al-Sufi's 'three famous stars'], [Greek: g]\r\nbeing evidently brighter than [Greek: b]. But there is no occasion to\r\nconjecture from this that any change of relative brightness has taken\r\nplace. Bayer reckoned both of these two of the third magnitude, and\r\nappears to have arranged [Greek: b] before [Greek: g], according to his\r\nusual custom, simply because [Greek: b] is in the neck of the supposed\r\neagle, and [Greek: g] at the root of one of the wings.\"[455] Another good\r\nexample is found in the stars of the \"Plough,\" in which the stars are\r\nevidently arranged in the order of the figure and not in the order of\r\nrelative brightness. In fact, Bayer is no guide at all with reference to\r\nstar magnitudes. How different Al-Sufi was in this respect!\r\n\r\nThe stars Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares, and Fomalhaut were called royal\r\nstars by the ancients. The reason of this was that they lie roughly about\r\n90° apart, that is 6 hours of Right Ascension. So, if through the north\r\nand south poles of the heavens and each of these stars we draw great\r\ncircles of the sphere, these circles will divide the sphere into four\r\nnearly equal parts, and the ancients supposed that each of these stars\r\nruled over a quarter of the sphere, an idea probably connected with\r\nastrology. As the position of Aldebaran is R.A. 4{h} 30{m}, Declination\r\nNorth 16° 19', and that of Antares is R.A. 16{h} 15{m}, Declination South\r\n25° 2', these two stars lie at nearly opposite points of the celestial\r\nsphere. From this it follows that our sun seen from Aldebaran would lie\r\nnot very far from Antares, and seen from Antares it would appear not far\r\nfrom Aldebaran.\r\n\r\nThe following may be considered as representative stars of different\r\nmagnitudes. For those of first magnitude and fainter I have only given\r\nthose for which all the best observers in ancient and modern times agree,\r\nand which have been confirmed by modern photometric measures.

The principal results are:--(1)\r\nThe number of stars on any \"given area of the Milky Way is about twice as\r\ngreat as in an equal area of any other region.\" (2) This ratio does not\r\nincrease for faint stars down to the 12th magnitude. (3) \"The Milky Way\r\ncovers about one-third of the sky and contains about half of the stars.\"\r\n(4) There are about 10,000 stars of magnitude 6·6 or brighter, 100,000\r\ndown to magnitude 8·7, one million to magnitude 11, and two millions to\r\nmagnitude 11·9. It is estimated that there are about 18 millions of stars\r\ndown to the 15th magnitude visible in a telescope of 15 inches\r\naperture.[456]\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Kapteyn's researches on stellar distribution, he finds\r\nthat going out from the earth into space, the \"star density\"--that is,\r\nthe number of stars per unit volume of space--is fairly constant until we\r\nreach a distance of about 200 \"light years.\" From this point the density\r\ngradually diminishes out to a distance of 2500 \"light years,\" at which\r\ndistance it is reduced to about one-fifth of the density in the sun's\r\nvicinity.[457]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the late Mr. Proctor (_Knowledge_, November, 1885, p. 21),\r\nSir John Herschel suggested that our Galaxy (or stellar system) \"contained\r\nwithin itself miniatures of itself.\" This beautiful idea is probably true.\r\nIn his account of the greater \"Magellanic cloud,\" Sir John Herschel\r\ndescribes one of the numerous objects it contains as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Very bright, very large; oval; very gradually pretty, much brighter\r\n    in the middle; a beautiful nebula; it has very much the resemblance to\r\n    the Nubecula Major itself as seen with the naked eye, but it is far\r\n    brighter and more impressive in its general aspect as if it were\r\n    doubled in intensity. Note--July 29, 1837. I well remember this\r\n    observation, it was the result of repeated comparisons between the\r\n    object seen in the telescope and the actual nubecula as seen high in\r\n    the sky on the meridian, and no vague estimate carelessly set down.\r\n    And who can say whether in this object, magnified and analysed by\r\n    telescopes infinitely superior to what we now possess, there may not\r\n    exist all the complexity of detail that the nubecula itself presents\r\n    to our examination?\"[458]\r\n\r\nThe late Lord Kelvin, in a remarkable address delivered before the\r\nPhysical Science Section of the British Association at its meeting at\r\nGlasgow in 1901, considered the probable quantity of matter contained in\r\nour Visible Universe. He takes a sphere of radius represented by the\r\ndistance of a star having a parallax of one-thousandth of a second (or\r\nabout 3000 years' journey for light), and he supposes that uniformly\r\ndistributed within this sphere there exists a mass of matter equal to 1000\r\nmillion times the sun's mass. With these data he finds that a body placed\r\noriginally at the surface of the sphere would in 5 million years acquire\r\nby gravitational force a velocity of about 12-1/2 miles a second, and\r\nafter 25 million of years a velocity of about 67 miles a second. As these\r\nvelocities are of the same order as the observed velocities among the\r\nstars, Lord Kelvin concludes that there _is_ probably as much matter in\r\nour universe as would be represented by a thousand million suns. If we\r\nassumed a mass of ten thousand suns the velocities would be much too high.\r\nThe most probable estimate of the total number of the visible stars is\r\nabout 100 millions; so that if Lord Kelvin's calculations are correct we\r\nseem bound to assume that space contains a number of dark bodies. The\r\nnebulæ, however, probably contain vast masses of matter, and this may\r\nperhaps account--partially, at least--for the large amount of matter\r\nestimated by Lord Kelvin. (See Chapter on \"Nebulæ.\")\r\n\r\nIn some notes on photographs of the Milky Way, Prof. Barnard says with\r\nreference to the great nebula near [Greek: r] Ophiuchi, \"The peculiarity\r\nof this region has suggested to me the idea that the apparently small\r\nstars forming the ground work of the Milky Way here, are really very small\r\nbodies compared with our own sun\"; and again, referring to the region near\r\n[Greek: b] Cygni, \"One is specially struck with the apparent extreme\r\nsmallness of the general mass of the stars in this region.\" Again, with\r\nreference to [Greek: ch] Cygni, he says, \"The stars here also are\r\nremarkably uniform in size.\"[459]\r\n\r\nEastman's results for parallax seem to show that \"the fainter rather than\r\nthe brighter stars are nearest to our system.\" But this apparent paradox\r\nis considered by Mr. Monck to be very misleading;[460] and the present\r\nwriter holds the same opinion.\r\n\r\nProf. Kapteyn finds \"that stars whose proper motions exceed 0\"·05 are not\r\nmore numerous in the Milky Way than in other parts of the sky; or, in\r\nother words, if only the stars having proper motions of 0\"·05 or upwards\r\nwere mapped, there would be no aggregation of stars showing the existence\r\nof the Milky Way.\"[461]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the number of stars visible on photographs, the late Dr.\r\nIsaac Roberts says--\r\n\r\n    \"So far as I am able at present to judge, under the atmospheric\r\n    conditions prevalent in this country, the limit of the photographic\r\n    method of delineation will be reached at stellar, or nebular, light of\r\n    the feebleness of about 18th-magnitude stars. The reason for this\r\n    inference is that the general illumination of the atmosphere by\r\n    starlight concentrated upon a film by the instrument will mask the\r\n    light of objects that are fainter than about 18th-magnitude\r\n    stars.\"[462]\r\n\r\nWith reference to blank spaces in the sky, the late Mr. Norman Pogson\r\nremarked--\r\n\r\n    \"Near S Ophiuchi we find one of the most remarkable vacuities in this\r\n    hemisphere--an elliptic space of about 65' in length in the direction\r\n    of R.A., and 40' in width, in which there exists _no_ star larger than\r\n    the 13th magnitude ... it is impossible to turn a large telescope in\r\n    that direction and, if I may so express it, view such black darkness,\r\n    without a feeling that we are here searching into the remote regions\r\n    of space, far beyond the limits of our own sidereal system.\"[463]\r\n\r\nProf. Barnard describes some regions in the constellation Taurus\r\ncontaining \"dark lanes\" in a groundwork of faint nebulosity. He gives two\r\nbeautiful photographs of the regions referred to, and says that the dark\r\nholes and lanes are apparently darker than the sky in the immediate\r\nvicinity. He says, \"A very singular feature in this connection is that the\r\nstars also are absent in general from the lanes.\" A close examination of\r\nthese photographs has given the present writer the impression that the\r\ndark lanes and spots are _in_ the nebulosity, and that the nebulosity is\r\nmixed up with the stars. This would account for the fact that the stars\r\nare in general absent from the dark lanes. For if there is an intimate\r\nrelation between the stars and the nebulosity, it would follow that where\r\nthere is no nebulosity in this particular region there would be no stars.\r\nProf. Barnard adds that the nebulosity is easily visible in a 12-inch\r\ntelescope.[464]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the life of the universe, Prof. F. R. Moulton well\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n    \"The lifetime of a man seems fairly long, and the epoch when Troy was\r\n    besieged, or when the Pharaohs piled up the pyramids in the valley of\r\n    the Nile, or when our ancestors separated on the high plateaux of\r\n    Asia, seems extremely remote, but these intervals are only moments\r\n    compared to the immense periods required for geological evolutions and\r\n    the enormously greater ones consumed in the developement of worlds\r\n    from widely extended nebulous masses. We recognize the existence of\r\n    only those forces whose immediate consequences are appreciable, and it\r\n    may be that those whose effects are yet unseen are really of the\r\n    highest importance. A little creature whose life extended over only\r\n    two or three hours of a summer's day might be led, if he were\r\n    sufficiently endowed with intelligence, to infer that passing clouds\r\n    were the chief influence at work in changing the climate instead of\r\n    perceiving that the sun's slow motion across the sky would bring on\r\n    the night and its southward motion the winter.\"[465]\r\n\r\nIn a review of my book _Astronomical Essays_ in _The Observatory_,\r\nSeptember, 1907, the following words occur. They seem to form a good and\r\nsufficient answer to people who ask, What is there beyond our visible\r\nuniverse? \"If the stellar universe is contained in a sphere of say 1000\r\nstellar units radius, what is there beyond? To this the astronomer will\r\nreply that theories and hypotheses are put forward for the purpose of\r\nexplaining observed facts; when there are no facts to be explained, no\r\ntheory is required. As there are no observed facts as to what exists\r\nbeyond the farthest stars, the mind of the astronomer is a complete blank\r\non the subject. Popular imagination can fill up the blank as it pleases.\"\r\nWith these remarks I fully concur.\r\n\r\nIn his address to the British Association, Prof. G. H. Darwin (now Sir\r\nGeorge Darwin) said--\r\n\r\n    \"Man is but a microscopic being relatively to astronomical space, and\r\n    he lives on a puny planet circling round a star of inferior rank. Does\r\n    it not, then, seem futile to imagine that he can discover the origin\r\n    and tendency of the Universe as to expect a housefly to instruct us as\r\n    to the theory of the motions of the planets? And yet, so long as he\r\n    shall last, he will pursue his search, and will no doubt discover many\r\n    wonderful things which are still hidden. We may indeed be amazed at\r\n    all that man has been able to find out, but the immeasurable magnitude\r\n    of the undiscovered will throughout all time remain to humble his\r\n    pride. Our children's children will still be gazing and marvelling at\r\n    the starry heavens, but the riddle will never be read.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient philosopher Lucretius said--\r\n\r\n  \"Globed from the atoms falling slow or swift\r\n  I see the suns, I see the systems lift\r\n  Their forms; and even the system and the suns\r\n  Shall go back slowly to the eternal drift.\"[466]\r\n\r\nBut it has been well said that the structure of the universe \"has a\r\nfascination of its own for most readers quite apart from any real progress\r\nwhich may be made towards its solution.\"[467]\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way itself, Mr. Stratonoff considers to be an agglomeration of\r\nimmense condensations, or stellar clouds, which are scattered round the\r\nregion of the galactic equator. These clouds, or masses of stars,\r\nsometimes leave spaces between them, and sometimes they overlap, and in\r\nthis way he accounts for the great rifts, like the Coal Sack, which allow\r\nus to see through this great circle of light. He finds other\r\ncondensations of stars; the nearest is one of which our sun is a member,\r\nchiefly composed of stars of the higher magnitudes which \"thin out rapidly\r\nas the Milky Way is approached.\" There are other condensations: one in\r\nstars of magnitudes 6·5 to 8·5; and a third, farther off, in stars of\r\nmagnitudes 7·6 to 8. These may be called opera-glass, or field-glass\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nStratonoff finds that stars with spectra of the first type (class A, B, C,\r\nand D of Harvard) which include the Sirian and Orion stars, are\r\nprincipally situated near the Milky Way, while those of type II. (which\r\nincludes the solar stars) \"are principally condensed in a region\r\ncoinciding roughly with the terrestrial pole, and only show a slight\r\nincrease, as compared with other stars, as the galaxy is approached.\"[468]\r\n\r\nProf. Kapteyn thinks that \"undoubtedly one of the greatest difficulties,\r\nif not the greatest of all, in the way of obtaining an understanding of\r\nthe real distribution of the stars in space, lies in our uncertainty about\r\nthe amount of loss suffered by the light of the stars on its way to the\r\nobserver.\"[469] He says, \"There can be little doubt in my opinion, about\r\nthe existence of absorption in space, and I think that even a good guess\r\nas to the order of its amount can be made. For, first we know that space\r\ncontains an enormous mass of meteoric matter. This matter must necessarily\r\nintercept some part of the star-light.\"\r\n\r\nThis absorption, however, seems to be comparatively small. Kapteyn finds a\r\nvalue of 0·016 (about 1/60th) of a magnitude for a star at a distance\r\ncorresponding to a parallax of one-tenth of a second (about 33 \"light\r\nyears\"). This is a quantity almost imperceptible in the most delicate\r\nphotometer. But for very great distances--such as 3000 \"light years\"--the\r\nabsorption would evidently become very considerable, and would account\r\nsatisfactorily for the gradual \"thinning out\" of the fainter stars. If\r\nthis were fully proved, we should have to consider the fainter stars of\r\nthe Milky Way to be in all probability fairly large suns, the light of\r\nwhich is reduced by absorption.\r\n\r\nThat some of the ancients knew that the Milky Way is composed of stars is\r\nshown by the following lines translated from Ovid:--\r\n\r\n  \"A way there is in heaven's extended plain\r\n  Which when the skies are clear is seen below\r\n  And mortals, by the name of Milky, know;\r\n  The groundwork is of stars, through which the road\r\n  Lies open to great Jupiter's abode.\"[470]\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of the distribution of the faint stars composing the\r\nMilky Way, and those shown in Argelander's charts of stars down to the\r\n9-1/2 magnitude, Easton finds that there is \"a real connection between the\r\ndistribution of 9th and 10th magnitude stars, and that of the faint stars\r\nof the Milky Way, and that consequently the faint or very faint stars of\r\nthe galactic zone are at a distance which does not greatly exceed that of\r\nthe 9th and 10th magnitude stars.\"[471] A similar conclusion was, I think,\r\narrived at by Proctor many years ago. Now let us consider the meaning of\r\nthis result. Taking stars of the 15th magnitude, if their faintness were\r\nmerely due to greater distance, their actual brightness--if of the same\r\nsize--would imply that they are at 10 times the distance of stars of the\r\n10th magnitude. But if at the same distance from us, a 10th magnitude star\r\nwould be 100 times brighter than a 15th magnitude star, and if of the same\r\ndensity and \"intrinsic brightness\" (or luminosity of surface) the 10th\r\nmagnitude would have 10 times the diameter of the fainter star, and hence\r\nits volume would be 1000 times greater (10{3}), and this great difference\r\nis not perhaps improbable.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the Milky Way is not the same in all its parts. The\r\nbright spot between [Greek: b] and [Greek: g] Cygni is due to relatively\r\nbright stars. Others equally dense but fainter regions in Auriga and\r\nMonoceros are only evident in stars of the 8th and 9th magnitude, and the\r\nlight of the well-known luminous spot in \"Sobieski's Shield,\" closely\r\nsouth of [Greek: l] Aquilæ, is due to stars below magnitude 9-1/2.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence in distribution between the stars of Argelander's\r\ncharts and the fainter stars of the Milky Way shows, as Easton points out,\r\nthat Herschel's hypothesis of a uniform distribution of stars of\r\napproximately equal size is quite untenable.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the Milky Way may perhaps form a ring of stars\r\nwith the sun placed nearly, but not exactly, in the centre of the ring.\r\nBut were it really a ring of uniform width with the sun eccentrically\r\nplaced within it, we should expect to find the Milky Way wider at its\r\nnearest part, and gradually narrowing towards the opposite point. Now,\r\nHerschel's \"gages\" and Celoria's counts show that the Galaxy is wider in\r\nAquila than in Monoceros. This is confirmed by Easton, who says, \"_for the\r\nfaint stars taken as a whole, the Milky Way is widest in its brightest\r\npart_\" (the italics are Easton's). From this we should conclude that the\r\nMilky Way is nearer to us in the direction of Aquila than in that of\r\nMonoceros. Sir John Herschel suggested that the southern parts of the\r\ngalactic zone are nearer to us on account of their greater _brightness_ in\r\nthose regions.[472] But greater width is a safer test of distance than\r\nrelative brightness. For it may be easily shown than the _intrinsic_\r\nbrightness of an area containing a large number of stars would be the\r\nsame for _all_ distances (neglecting the supposed absorption of light in\r\nspace). For suppose any given area crowded with stars to be removed to a\r\ngreater distance. The light of each star would be diminished inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance. But the given area would also be diminished\r\n_directly_ as the square of the distance, so we should have a diminished\r\namount of light on an equally diminished area, and hence the intrinsic\r\nbrightness, or luminosity of the area per unit of surface, would remain\r\nunaltered. The increased brightness of the Milky Way in Aquila is\r\naccounted for by the fact that Herschel's \"gages\" show an increased number\r\nof stars, and hence the brightness in Aquila and Sagittarius does not\r\nnecessarily imply that the Milky Way is nearer to us in those parts, but\r\nthat it is richer in small stars than in other regions.\r\n\r\nEaston is of opinion that the annular hypothesis of the Milky Way is\r\ninconsistent with our present knowledge of the galactic phenomena, and he\r\nsuggests that its actual constitution resembles more that of a spiral\r\nnebula.[473] On this hypothesis the increase in the number of stars in the\r\nregions above referred to may be due to our seeing one branch of the\r\nsupposed \"two-branched spiral\" projected on another branch of the same\r\nspiral. This seems supported by Sir John Herschel's observations in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, where he found in some places \"a tissue as it were of\r\nlarge stars spread over another of very small ones, the immediate\r\nmagnitudes being wanting.\" Again, portions of the spiral branches may be\r\nricher than others, as photographs of spiral nebulæ seem to indicate.\r\nCeloria, rejecting the hypothesis of a single ring, suggests the existence\r\nof _two_ galactic rings inclined to each other at an angle of about 20°,\r\none of these including the brighter stars, and the other the fainter. But\r\nthis seems to be a more artificial arrangement then the hypothesis of a\r\nspiral. Further, the complicated structure of the Milky Way cannot be well\r\nexplained by Celoria's hypothesis of two distinct rings one inside the\r\nother. From analogy the spiral hypothesis seems much more probable.\r\n\r\nConsidering the Milky Way to represent a colossal spiral nebula viewed\r\nfrom a point not far removed from the centre of the spiral branches,\r\nEaston suggests that the bright region between [Greek: b] and [Greek: g]\r\nCygni, which is very rich in comparatively bright stars, may possibly\r\nrepresent the \"_central accumulations of the Milky Way_,\" that is, the\r\nportion corresponding to the nucleus of a spiral nebula. If this be so,\r\nthis portion of the Milky Way should be nearer to us than others. Easton\r\nalso thinks that the so-called \"solar cluster\" of Gould, Kapteyn, and\r\nSchiaparelli may perhaps be \"the expression of the central condensation\r\nof the galactic system itself, composed of the most part of suns\r\ncomparable with our own, and which would thus embrace most of the bright\r\nstars to the 9th or 10th magnitude. The distance of the galactic streams\r\nand convolutions would thus be comparable with the distances of these\r\nstars.\" He thinks that the sun lies within a gigantic spiral, \"in a\r\ncomparatively sparse region between the central nucleus and Orion.\"\r\n\r\nScheiner thinks that \"the irregularities of the Milky Way, especially in\r\nstreams, can be quite well accounted for, as Easton has attempted to do,\r\nif they are regarded as a system of spirals, and not as a ring system.\"\r\n\r\nEvidence in favour of the spiral hypothesis of the Milky Way, as advocated\r\nby Easton and Scheiner, may be found in Kapteyn's researches on the proper\r\nmotions of the stars. This eminent astronomer finds that stars with\r\nmeasurable proper motions--and therefore in all probability relatively\r\nnear the earth--have mostly spectra of the solar type, and seem to cluster\r\nround \"a point adjacent to the sun, in total disregard to the position of\r\nthe Milky Way,\" and that stars with little or no proper motion collect\r\nround the galactic plain. He is also of opinion that the Milky Way\r\nresembles the Andromeda nebula, \"the globular nucleus representing the\r\nsolar cluster, and the far spreading wings or whorls the compressed layer\r\nof stars enclosed by the rings of the remote Galaxy.\"\r\n\r\nWith reference to the plurality of inhabited worlds, it has been well said\r\nby the ancient writer Metrodorus (third century B.C.), \"The idea that\r\nthere is but a single world in all infinitude would be as absurd as to\r\nsuppose that a vast field had been formed to produce a single blade of\r\nwheat.\"[474] With this opinion the present writer fully concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n\r\nThe achievements of Hipparchus in astronomy were very remarkable,\r\nconsidering the age in which he lived. He found the amount of the apparent\r\nmotion of the stars due to the precession of the equinoxes (of which he\r\nwas the discoverer) to be 59\" per annum. The correct amount is about 50\".\r\nHe measured the length of the year to within 9 minutes of its true value.\r\nHe found the inclination of the ecliptic to the plane of the equator to be\r\n23° 51'. It was then 23° 46'--as we now know by modern calculations--so\r\nthat Hipparchus' estimation was a wonderfully close approximation to the\r\ntruth. He computed the moon's parallax to be 57', which is about its\r\ncorrect value. He found the eccentricity of the sun's apparent orbit round\r\nthe earth to be one twenty-fourth, the real value being then about\r\none-thirteenth. He determined other motions connected with the earth and\r\nmoon; and formed a catalogue of 1080 stars. All this work has earned for\r\nhim the well-merited title of \"The Father of Astronomy.\"[475]\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of a Greek passage ascribed to Ptolemy: \"I\r\nknow that I am mortal and the creature of a day, but when I search out the\r\nmany rolling circles of the stars, my feet touch the earth no longer, but\r\nwith Zeus himself I take my fill of ambrosia, the food of the gods.\"[476]\r\nThis was inscribed (in Greek) on a silver loving cup presented to the late\r\nProfessor C. A. Young, the famous American astronomer.[477]\r\n\r\nSome curious and interesting phenomena are recorded in the old Chinese\r\nAnnals, which go back to a great antiquity. In 687 B.C. \"a night\" is\r\nmentioned \"without clouds and without stars\" (!) This may perhaps refer to\r\na total eclipse of the sun; but if so, the eclipse is not mentioned in the\r\nChinese list of eclipses. In the year 141 B.C., it is stated that the sun\r\nand moon appeared of a deep red colour during 5 days, a phenomenon which\r\ncaused great terror among the people. In 74 B.C., it is related that a\r\nstar as large as the moon appeared, and was followed in its motion by\r\nseveral stars of ordinary size. This probably refers to an unusually large\r\n\"bolide\" or \"fireball.\" In 38 B.C., a fall of meteoric stones is recorded\r\n\"of the size of a walnut.\" In A.D. 88, another fall of stones is\r\nmentioned. In A.D. 321, sun-spots were visible to the naked eye.\r\n\r\nHomer speaks of a curious darkness which occurred during one of the great\r\nbattles in the last year of the Trojan war. Mr. Stockwell identifies this\r\nwith an eclipse of the sun which took place on August 28, 1184 B.C. An\r\neclipse referred to by Thucydides as having occurred during the first year\r\nof the Peloponnesian War, when the darkness was so great that some stars\r\nwere seen, is identified by Stockwell with a total eclipse of the sun,\r\nwhich took place on August 2, 430 B.C.\r\n\r\nA great eclipse of the sun is supposed to have occurred in the year 43 or\r\n44 B.C., soon after the death of Julius Cæsar. Baron de Zach and Arago\r\nmention it as the first annular eclipse on record. But calculations show\r\nthat no solar eclipse whatever, visible in Italy, occurred in either of\r\nthese years. The phenomenon referred to must therefore have been of\r\natmospherical origin, and indeed this is suggested by a passage in\r\nSuetonius, one of the authors quoted on the subject.\r\n\r\nM. Guillaume thinks that the ninth Egyptian plague, the thick \"darkness\"\r\n(Exodus x. 21-23), may perhaps be explained by a total eclipse of the sun\r\nwhich occurred in 1332 B.C. It is true that the account states that the\r\ndarkness lasted \"three days,\" but this, M. Guillaume thinks, may be due to\r\nan error in the translation.[478] This explanation, however, seems very\r\nimprobable.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hind, the moon was eclipsed on the generally received date\r\nof the Crucifixion, A.D. 33, April 3. He says, \"I find she had emerged\r\nfrom the earth's dark shadow a quarter of an hour before she rose at\r\nJerusalem (6{h} 36{m} p.m.); but the penumbra continued upon her disc for\r\nan hour afterwards.\" An eclipse could not have had anything to do with the\r\n\"darkness over all the land\" during the Crucifixion. For this lasted for\r\nthree hours, and the totality of a solar eclipse can only last a few\r\nminutes at the most. As a matter of fact the \"eclipse of Phlegon,\" a\r\npartial one (A.D. 29, November 24) was \"the only solar eclipse that could\r\nhave been visible in Jerusalem during the period usually fixed for the\r\nministry of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nIt is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that a total eclipse of the\r\nsun took place in the year after King Alfred's great battle with the\r\nDanes. Now, calculation shows that this eclipse occurred on October 29,\r\n878 A.D. King Alfred's victory over the Danes must, therefore, have taken\r\nplace in 877 A.D., and his death probably occurred in 899 A.D. This solar\r\neclipse is also mentioned in the Annals of Ulster. From this it will be\r\nseen that in some cases the dates of historical events can be accurately\r\nfixed by astronomical phenomena.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by some historians that an eclipse of the sun took place on\r\nthe morning of the battle of Crecy, August 26, 1346. But calculation\r\nshows that there was no eclipse of the sun visible in England in that\r\nyear. At the time of the famous battle the moon had just entered on her\r\nfirst quarter, and she was partially eclipsed six days afterwards--that is\r\non the 1st of September. The mistake seems to have arisen from a\r\nmistranslation of the old French word _esclistre_, which means lightning.\r\nThis was mistaken for _esclipse_. The account seems to indicate that there\r\nwas a heavy thunderstorm on the morning of the battle.\r\n\r\nA dark shade was seen on the waning moon by Messrs. Hirst and J. C.\r\nRussell on October 21, 1878, \"as dark as the shadow during an eclipse of\r\nthe moon.\"[479] If this observation is correct, it is certainly most\r\ndifficult to explain. Another curious observation is recorded by Mr. E.\r\nStone Wiggins, who says that a partial eclipse of the sun by a dark body\r\nwas observed in the State of Michigan (U.S.A.) on May 16, 1884, at 7 p.m.\r\nThe \"moon at that moment was 12 degrees south of the equator and the sun\r\nas many degrees north of it.\" The existence of a dark satellite of the\r\nearth has been suggested, but this seems highly improbable.\r\n\r\nThe sun's corona seems to have been first noticed in the total eclipse of\r\nthe sun which occurred at the death of the Roman emperor Domitian, A.D.\r\n95. Philostratus in his _Life of Apollonius_ says, with reference to this\r\neclipse, \"In the heavens there appeared a prodigy of this nature: a\r\ncertain _corona_ resembling the Iris surrounded the orb of the sun, and\r\nobscured its light.\"[480] In more modern times the corona seems to have\r\nbeen first noticed by Clavius during the total eclipse of April 9,\r\n1567.[481] Kepler proved that this eclipse was total, not annular, so that\r\nthe ring seen by Clavius must have been the corona.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the visibility of planets and stars during total\r\neclipses of the sun; in the eclipse of May 12, 1706, Venus, Mercury, and\r\nAldebaran, and several other stars were seen. During the totality of the\r\neclipse of May 3, 1715, about twenty stars were seen with the naked\r\neye.[482] At the eclipse of May 22, 1724, Venus and Mercury, and a few\r\nfixed stars were seen.[483] The corona was also noticed. At the eclipse of\r\nMay 2, 1733, Jupiter, the stars of the \"Plough,\" Capella, and other stars\r\nwere visible to the naked eye; and the corona was again seen.[483]\r\n\r\nDuring the total eclipses of February 9, 1766, June 24, 1778, and June 16,\r\n1806, the corona was again noticed. But its true character was then\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nAt the eclipse of July 8, 1842, it was noticed by observers at Lipesk\r\nthat the stars Aldebaran and Betelgeuse ([Greek: a] Orionis), which are\r\nusually red, \"appeared quite white.\"[484]\r\n\r\nThere will be seven eclipses in the years 1917, 1935, and 1985. In the\r\nyear 1935 there will be five eclipses of the sun, a rare event; and in\r\n1985 there will be three total eclipses of the moon, a most unusual\r\noccurrence.[485]\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Hindoos, the common people believed that eclipses were\r\ncaused by the interposition of a monstrous demon called Raha. This absurd\r\nidea, and others equally ridiculous, were based on declarations in their\r\nsacred books, and no pious Hindoo would think of denying it.\r\n\r\nThe following cases of darkenings of the sun are given by Humboldt:--\r\n\r\nAccording to Plutarch the sun remained pale for a whole year at the death\r\nof Julius Cæsar, and gave less than its usual heat.[486]\r\n\r\nA sun-darkening lasting for two hours is recorded on August 22, 358 A.D.,\r\nbefore the great earthquake of Nicomedia.\r\n\r\nIn 360 A.D. there was a sun-darkening from early morn till noon. The\r\ndescription given by the historians of the time corresponds to an eclipse\r\nof the sun, but the duration of the obscurity is inexplicable.\r\n\r\nIn 409 A.D., when Alaric lay siege to Rome, \"there was so great a\r\ndarkness that the stars were seen by day.\"\r\n\r\nIn 536 A.D. the sun is said to have been darkened for a year and two\r\nmonths!\r\n\r\nIn 626 A.D., according to Abul Farag, half the sun's disc was darkened for\r\neight months!\r\n\r\nIn 934 A.D. the sun lost its brightness for two months in Portugal.\r\n\r\nIn 1090 A.D. the sun was darkened for three hours.\r\n\r\nIn 1096, sun-spots were seen with the naked eye on March 3.\r\n\r\nIn 1206 A.D. on the last day of February, \"there was complete darkness for\r\nsix hours, turning the day into night.\" This seems to have occurred in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nIn 1241 the sun was so darkened that stars could be seen at 3 p.m. on\r\nMichaelmas day. This happened in Vienna.[487]\r\n\r\nThe sun is said to have been so darkened in the year 1547 A.D. for three\r\ndays that stars were visible at midday. This occurred about the time of\r\nthe battle of Mühlbergh.[488]\r\n\r\nSome of these darkenings may possibly have been due to an enormous\r\ndevelopment of sun-spots; but in some cases the darkness is supposed by\r\nChladni and Schnurrer to have been caused by \"the passage of meteoric\r\nmasses before the sun's disc.\"\r\n\r\nThe first observer of a transit of Venus was Jeremiah Horrocks, who\r\nobserved the transit of November 24 (O.S.), 1639. He had previously\r\ncorrected Kepler's predicted time of the transit from 8{h} 8{m} a.m. at\r\nManchester to 5{h} 57{m} p.m. At the end of 1875 a marble scroll was\r\nplaced on the pedestal of the monument of John Conduitt (nephew of Sir\r\nIsaac Newton, and who adopted Horrocks' theory of lunar motions) at the\r\nwest end of the nave of Westminster Abbey, bearing this inscription from\r\nthe pen of Dean Stanley--\r\n\r\n  \"Ad majora avocatus\r\n  quæ ob hæc parerga negligi non decuit\"\r\n  IN MEMORY OF\r\n  JEREMIAH HORROCKS\r\n  Curate of Hoole in Lancashire\r\n  Who died on the 3{d} of January, 1641, in or near his\r\n  22{d} year\r\n  Having in so short a life\r\n  Detected the long inequality in the mean motion of\r\n  Jupiter and Saturn\r\n  Discovered the orbit of the Moon to be an ellipse;\r\n  Determined the motion of the lunar aspe,\r\n  Suggested the physical cause of its revolution;\r\n  And predicted from his own observations, the\r\n  Transit of Venus\r\n  Which was seen by himself and his friend\r\n  WILLIAM CRABTREE\r\n  On Sunday, the 24th November (O.S.) 1639;\r\n  This Tablet, facing the Monument of Newton\r\n  Was raised after the lapse of more than two centuries\r\n  December 9, 1874.[489]\r\n\r\nThe transit of Venus which occurred in 1761 was observed on board ship(!)\r\nby the famous but unfortunate French astronomer Le Gentil. The ship was\r\nthe frigate _Sylphide_, sent to the help of Pondicherry (India) which was\r\nthen being besieged by the English. Owing to unfavourable winds the\r\n_Sylphide_ was tossed about from March 25, 1761, to May 24 of the same\r\nyear. When, on the later date, off the coast of Malabar, the captain of\r\nthe frigate learned that Pondicherry had been captured by the English, the\r\nvessel returned to the Isle of France, where it arrived on June 23, after\r\ntouching at Point de Galle on May 30. It was between these two places that\r\nLe Gentil made his observations of the transit of Venus under such\r\nunfavourable conditions. He had an object-glass of 15 feet (French) focus,\r\nand this he mounted in a tube formed of \"four pine planks.\" This rough\r\ninstrument was fixed to a small mast set up on the quarter-deck and worked\r\nby ropes. The observations made under such curious conditions, were not,\r\nas may be imagined, very satisfactory. As another transit was to take\r\nplace on June 3, 1769, Le Gentil made the heroic resolution of remaining\r\nin the southern hemisphere to observe it! This determination was duly\r\ncarried out, but his devotion to astronomy was not rewarded; for on the\r\nday of the long waited for transit the sky at Pondicherry (where he had\r\ngone to observe it) was clouded over during the whole phenomenon,\r\n\"although for many days previous the sky had been cloudless.\" To add to\r\nhis feeling of disappointment he heard that at Manilla, where he had been\r\nstaying some time previously, the sky was quite clear, and two of his\r\nfriends there had seen the transit without any difficulty.[490] Truly the\r\nunfortunate Le Gentil was a martyr to science.\r\n\r\nThe famous German astronomer Bessel once said \"that a practical astronomer\r\ncould make observations of value if he had only a cart-wheel and a gun\r\nbarrel\"; and Watson said that \"the most important part of the instrument\r\nis the person at the small end.\"[491]\r\n\r\nWith reference to Father Hell's supposed forgery of his observations of\r\nthe transit of Venus in 1769, and Littrow's criticism of some of the\r\nentries in Hell's manuscript being corrected with a different coloured\r\nink, Professor Newcomb ascertained from Weiss that Littrow was colour\r\nblind, and could not distinguish between the colour of Aldebaran and the\r\nwhitest star. Newcomb adds, \"For half a century the astronomical world had\r\nbased an impression on the innocent but mistaken evidence of a\r\ncolour-blind man respecting the tint of ink in a manuscript.\"\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that on February 26, B.C. 2012, the moon, Mercury, Venus,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn, were in the same constellation, and within 14\r\ndegrees of each other. On September 14, 1186 A.D., the sun, moon, and all\r\nthe planets then known, are said to have been situated in Libra.[492]\r\n\r\nIn the Sanscrit epic poem, \"The Ramaya,\" it is stated that at the birth of\r\nRama, the moon was in Cancer, the sun in Aries, Mercury in Taurus, Venus\r\nin Pisces, Mars in Capricornus, Jupiter in Cancer, and Saturn in Libra.\r\nFrom these data, Mr. Walter R. Old has computed that Rama was born on\r\nFebruary 10, 1761 B.C.[493]\r\n\r\nA close conjunction of Mars and Saturn was observed by Denning on\r\nSeptember 29, 1889, the bright star Regulus ([Greek: a] Leonis) being at\r\nthe time only 47' distant from the planets.[494]\r\n\r\nAn occultation of the Pleiades by the moon was observed by Timocharis at\r\nAlexandria on January 29, 282 B.C. Calculations by Schjellerup show that\r\nAlcyone ([Greek: ê] Tauri) was occulted; but the exact time of the day\r\nrecorded by Timocharis differs very considerably from that computed by\r\nSchjellerup.[495] Another occultation of the Pleiades is recorded by\r\nAgrippa in the reign of Domitian. According to Schjellerup the phenomenon\r\noccurred on November 29, A.D. 92.\r\n\r\n\"Kepler states that on the 9th of January, 1591, Mæstlin and himself\r\nwitnessed an occultation of Jupiter by Mars. The red colour of the latter\r\non that occasion plainly indicated that it was the inferior planet.\"[496]\r\nThat is, that Mars was nearer to the sun than Jupiter. But as the\r\ntelescope had not then been invented, this may have been merely a near\r\napproach of the two planets.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kepler, Mæstlin saw an occultation of Mars by Venus on\r\nOctober 3, 1590. But this may also have been merely a near approach.[496]\r\n\r\nA curious paradox is that one can discover an object without seeing it,\r\nand see an object without discovering it! The planet Neptune was\r\ndiscovered by Adams and Leverrier by calculation before it was seen in the\r\ntelescope by Galle; and it was actually seen by Lalande on May 8 and 10,\r\n1795, but he took it for a _star_ and thus missed the discovery. In fact,\r\nhe _saw_ the planet, but did not _discover_ it. It actually appears as a\r\nstar of the 8th magnitude in Harding's Atlas (1822). The great \"new star\"\r\nof February, 1901, known as Nova Persei, was probably seen by some people\r\nbefore its discovery was announced; and it was actually noticed by a\r\nwell-known American astronomer, who thought it was some bright star with\r\nwhich he was not familiar! But this did not amount to a discovery. Any one\r\nabsolutely ignorant of astronomy might have made the same observation. An\r\nobject must be _identified_ as a _new_ object before a discovery can be\r\nclaimed. Some years ago a well-known Irish naturalist discovered a spider\r\nnew to science, and after its discovery he found that it was common in\r\nnearly every house in Dublin! But this fact did not detract in the least\r\nfrom the merit of its scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThere is a story of an eminent astronomer who had been on several eclipse\r\nexpeditions, and yet was heard to remark that he had never seen a total\r\neclipse of the sun. \"But your observations of several eclipses are on\r\nrecord,\" it was objected. \"Certainly, I have on several occasions made\r\nobservations, but I have always been too busy to look at the eclipse.\" He\r\nwas probably in a dark tent taking photographs or using a spectroscope\r\nduring the totality. This was observing an eclipse without seeing it!\r\n\r\nHumboldt gives the credit of the invention of the telescope to Hans\r\nLippershey, a native of Wesel and a spectacle-maker at Middleburgh; to\r\nJacob Adreaansz, surnamed Metius, who is also said to have made\r\nburning-glasses of ice; and to Zachariah Jansen.[497]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the parabolic figure of the large mirrors of reflecting\r\ntelescopes, Dr. Robinson remarked at the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Cork in 1843, \"between the spherical and parabolic figures\r\nthe extreme difference is so slight, even in the telescope of 6-feet\r\naperture [Lord Rosse's] that if the two surfaces touched at their vertex,\r\nthe distance at the edge would not amount to the 1/10000th of an inch, a\r\nspace which few can measure, and none without a microscope.\"[498]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1758, Roger Long, Lowndean Professor of Astronomy at\r\nCambridge, constructed an \"orrery\" on a novel principle. It was a hollow\r\nmetal sphere of about 18 feet in diameter with its fixed axis parallel to\r\nthe earth's axis. It was rotated, by means of a winch and rackwork. It\r\nheld about thirty persons in its interior, where astronomical lectures\r\nwere delivered. The constellations were painted on the interior surface;\r\nand holes pierced through the shell and illuminated from the outside\r\nrepresented the stars according to their different magnitudes. This\r\ningenious machine was much neglected for many years, but was still in\r\nexistence in Admiral Smyth's time, 1844.[499]\r\n\r\nA \"temporary star\" is said to have been seen by Hepidanus in the\r\nconstellation Aries in either 1006 or 1012 A.D. The late M. Schönfeld, a\r\ngreat authority on variable stars, found from an Arabic and Syrian\r\nchronicle that 1012 is the correct year (396 of the Hegira), but that the\r\nword translated Aries would by a probable emendation mean Scorpio. The\r\nword in the Syrian record is not the word for Aries.[500]\r\n\r\nMr. Heber D. Curtis finds that the faintest stars mentioned in Ptolemy's\r\nCatalogue are about 5·38 magnitude on the scale of the Harvard\r\n_Photometric Durchmustering_.[501] Heis and Houzeau saw stars of 6-7\r\nmagnitude (about 6·4 on Harvard scale). The present writer found that he\r\ncould see most of Heis' faintest stars in the west of Ireland (Co. Sligo)\r\nwithout optical aid (except short-sighted spectacles).\r\n\r\nWith reference to the apparent changes in the stellar heavens produced by\r\nthe precession of the equinoxes, Humboldt says--\r\n\r\n    \"Canopus was fully 1° 20' below the horizon of Toledo (39° 54' north\r\n    latitude) in the time of Columbus; and now the same star is almost as\r\n    much above the horizon of Cadiz. While at Berlin, and in northern\r\n    latitudes, the stars of the Southern Cross, as well as [Greek: a] and\r\n    [Greek: b] Centauri, are receding more and more from view, the\r\n    Magellanic Clouds are slowly approaching our latitudes. Canopus was at\r\n    its greatest northern approximation during last century [eighteenth],\r\n    and is now moving nearer and nearer to the south, although very\r\n    slowly, owing to its vicinity to the south pole of the ecliptic. The\r\n    Southern Cross began to become invisible in 52° 30' north latitude\r\n    2900 years before our era, since, according to Galle, this\r\n    constellation might previously have reached an altitude of more than\r\n    10°. When it had disappeared from the horizon of the countries of the\r\n    Baltic, the great pyramid of Cheops had already been erected more than\r\n    five hundred years. The pastoral tribe of the Hyksos made their\r\n    incursion seven hundred years earlier. The past seems to be visibly\r\n    nearer to us when we connect its measurement with great and memorable\r\n    events.\"[502]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the great Grecian philosopher and scientist Eratosthenes\r\nof Cyrene, keeper of the Alexandrian Library under Ptolemy Euergetes, Carl\r\nSnyder says, \"Above all the Alexanders, Cæsars, Tadema-Napoleons, I set\r\nthe brain which first spanned the earth, over whose little patches these\r\nfought through their empty bootless lives. Why should we have no poet to\r\ncelebrate so great a deed?\"[503] And with reference to Aristarchus he\r\nsays, \"If grandeur of conceptions be a measure of the brain, or ingenuity\r\nof its powers, then we must rank Aristarchus as one of the three or four\r\nmost acute intellects of the ancient world.\"[504]\r\n\r\nLagrange, who often asserted Newton to be the greatest genius that ever\r\nexisted, used to remark also--\"and the most fortunate; we do not find more\r\nthan once a system of the world to establish.\"[505]\r\n\r\nGrant says--\r\n\r\n    \"Lagrange deserves to be ranked among the greatest mathematical\r\n    geniuses of ancient or modern times. In this respect he is worthy of a\r\n    place with Archimedes or Newton, although he was far from possessing\r\n    the sagacity in physical enquiries which distinguished these\r\n    illustrious sages. From the very outset of his career he assumed a\r\n    commanding position among the mathematicians of the age, and during\r\n    the course of nearly half a century previous to his death, he\r\n    continued to divide with Laplace the homage due to pre-eminence in the\r\n    exact sciences. His great rival survived him fourteen years, during\r\n    which he reigned alone as the prince of mathematicians and theoretical\r\n    astronomers.\"[506]\r\n\r\nA writer in _Nature_ (May 25, 1871) relates the following anecdote with\r\nreference to Sir John Herschel: \"Some time after the death of Laplace, the\r\nwriter of this notice, while travelling on the continent in company with\r\nthe celebrated French _savant_ Biot, ventured to put to him the question,\r\nnot altogether a wise one, 'And whom of all the philosophers of Europe do\r\nyou regard as the most worthy successor of Laplace?' Probably no man was\r\nbetter able than Biot to form a correct conclusion, and the reply was more\r\njudicious than the question. It was this, 'If I did not love him so much I\r\nshould unhesitatingly say, Sir John Herschel.'\" Dr. Gill (now Sir David\r\nGill), in an address at the Cape of Good Hope in June, 1898, spoke of Sir\r\nJohn Herschel as \"the prose poet of science; his popular scientific works\r\nare models of clearness, and his presidential addresses teem with\r\npassages of surpassing beauty. His life was a pure and blameless one from\r\nfirst to last, full of the noblest effort and the noblest aim from the\r\ntime when as a young Cambridge graduate he registered a vow 'to try to\r\nleave the world wiser than he found it'--a vow that his life amply\r\nfulfilled.\"[507]\r\n\r\nProf. Newcomb said of Adams, the co-discoverer of Neptune with Leverrier,\r\n\"Adams' intellect was one of the keenest I ever knew. The most difficult\r\nproblem of mathematical astronomy and the most recondite principles that\r\nunderlie the theory of the celestial motions were to him but child's\r\nplay.\" Airy he regarded as \"the most commanding figure in the astronomy of\r\nour time.\"[508] He spoke of Delaunay, the great French astronomer, as a\r\nmost kindly and attractive man, and says, \"His investigations of the\r\nmoon's motion is one of the most extraordinary pieces of mathematical work\r\never turned out by a single person. It fills two quarto volumes, and the\r\nreader who attempts to go through any part of the calculations will wonder\r\nhow one man could do the work in a lifetime.\"[509]\r\n\r\nSir George B. Airy and Prof. J. C. Adams died in the same month. The\r\nformer on January 2, 1892, and the latter on January 22 of the same year.\r\n\r\nIt is known from the parish register of Burstow in Surrey that Flamsteed\r\n(Rev. John Flamsteed), the first Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, was buried\r\nin the church at that place on January 12, 1720; but a search for his\r\ngrave made by Mr. J. Carpenter in 1866 and by Mr. Lynn in 1880 led to no\r\nresult. In Mrs. Flamsteed's will a sum of twenty-five pounds was left for\r\nthe purpose of erecting a monument to the memory of the great astronomer\r\nin Burstow Church; but it does not appear that any monument was ever\r\nerected. Flamsteed was Rector of the Parish of Burstow.[510] He was\r\nsucceeded in 1720 by the Rev. James Pound, another well-known astronomer.\r\nPound died in 1724.[511]\r\n\r\nEvelyn says in his Diary, 1676, September 10, \"Dined with Mr. Flamsteed,\r\nthe learned astrologer and mathematician, whom his Majesty had established\r\nin the new Observatory in Greenwich Park furnished with the choicest\r\ninstruments. An honest sincere man.\"[512] This shows that in those days\r\nthe term \"astrologer\" was synonymous with \"astronomer.\"\r\n\r\nIn an article on \"Our Debt to Astronomy,\" by Prof. Russell Tracy Crawford\r\n(Berkeley Astronomical Department, California, U.S.A.), the following\r\nremarks occur:--\r\n\r\n    \"Behind the artisan is a chemist, behind the chemist is a physicist,\r\n    behind the physicist is a mathematician, and behind the mathematician\r\n    is an astronomer.\" \"Were it not for the data furnished by astronomers,\r\n    commerce by sea would practically stop. The sailing-master on the high\r\n    seas could not determine his position, nor in what direction to head\r\n    his ship in order to reach a desired harbour. Think what this means in\r\n    dollars and cents, and estimate it if you can. For this one service\r\n    alone the science of astronomy is worth more in dollars and cents to\r\n    the world in one week than has been expended upon it since the\r\n    beginning of civilization. Do you think that Great Britain, for\r\n    instance, would take in exchange an amount equal to its national debt\r\n    for what astronomy gives it? I answer for you most emphatically,\r\n    'No.'\"\r\n\r\nIn his interesting book, _Reminiscences of an Astronomer_, Prof. Simon\r\nNewcomb says with reference to the calculations for the _Nautical Almanac_\r\n(referred to in the above extract)--\r\n\r\n    \"A more hopeless problem than this could not be presented to the\r\n    ordinary human intellect. There are tens of thousands of men who could\r\n    be successful in all the ordinary walks of life, hundreds who could\r\n    wield empires, thousands who could gain wealth, for one who could take\r\n    up this astronomical problem with any hope of success. The men who\r\n    have done it are, therefore, in intellect the select few of the human\r\n    race--an aristocracy ranking above all others in the scale of being.\r\n    The astronomical ephemeris is the last outcome of their productive\r\n    genius.\"\r\n\r\nIn a paper on the \"Aspects of American Astronomy,\" Prof. Newcomb says, \"A\r\ngreat telescope is of no use without a man at the end of it, and what the\r\ntelescope may do depends more upon this appendage than upon the instrument\r\nitself. The place which telescopes and observatories have taken in\r\nastronomical history are by no means proportional to their dimensions.\r\nMany a great instrument has been a mere toy in the hands of its owner.\r\nMany a small one has become famous. Twenty years ago there was here in\r\nyour city [Chicago] a modest little instrument which, judged by its size,\r\ncould not hold up its head with the great ones even of that day. It was\r\nthe private property of a young man holding no scientific position and\r\nscarcely known to the public. And yet that little telescope is to-day\r\namong the famous ones of the world, having made memorable advances in the\r\nastronomy of double stars, and shown its owner to be a worthy successor of\r\nthe Herschels and Struves in that line of work.\"[513] Here Prof. Newcomb\r\nevidently refers to Prof. Burnham, and the 6-inch telescope with which he\r\nmade many of his remarkable discoveries of double stars. With reference to\r\nBurnham's work, Prof. Barnard says--\r\n\r\n    \"It represents the labour of a struggling amateur, who during the day\r\n    led the drudging life of a stenographer in the United States court in\r\n    Chicago, and at night worked among the stars for the pure love of it.\r\n    Such work deserves an everlasting fame, and surely this has fallen to\r\n    Mr. Burnham.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth says--\r\n\r\n    \"A man may prove a good astronomer without possessing a spacious\r\n    observatory: thus Kepler was wont to observe on the bridge at Prague;\r\n    Schröter studied the moon, and Harding found a planet from a\r\n    _gloriette_; while Olbers discovered two new planets from an attic of\r\n    his house.\"[514]\r\n\r\nIt is probably not generally known that \"some of the greatest astronomers\r\nof modern times, such as Kepler, Newton, Hansen, Laplace, and Leverrier,\r\nscarcely ever looked through a telescope.\"[515]\r\n\r\nKepler, who always signed himself Keppler in German, is usually supposed\r\nto have been born on December 21, 1571, in the imperial town of Weil, but\r\naccording to Baron von Breitschwert,[516] he was really born on December\r\n27, 1571, in the village of Magstadt in Wurtemberg.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lieut. Winterhalter, M. Perrotin of the Nice Observatory\r\ndeclared \"that two hours' work with a large instrument is as fatiguing as\r\neight with a small one, the labour involved increasing in proportion to\r\nthe cube of the aperture, the chances of seeing decreasing in the same\r\nratio, while it can hardly be said that the advantages increase in like\r\nproportion.\"[517]\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Proctor has well said--\r\n\r\n    \"It is well to remember that the hatred which many entertain against\r\n    the doctrine of development as applied to solar systems and stellar\r\n    galaxies is not in reality a sign, as they imagine, of humility, but\r\n    is an effort to avoid the recognition of the nothingness of man in the\r\n    presence of the infinities of space and time and vitality presented\r\n    within the universe of God.\"[518]\r\n\r\nHumboldt says--\r\n\r\n    \"That arrogant spirit of incredulity, which rejects facts without\r\n    attempting to investigate them, is in some cases almost more injurious\r\n    than an unquestioning credulity. Both are alike detrimental to the\r\n    force of investigations.\"[519]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the precession of the equinoxes and the changes it\r\nproduces in the position of the Pole Star, it is stated in a recent book\r\non science that the entrance passage of the Great Pyramid of Ghizeh is\r\ninclined at an angle of 30° to the horizon, and therefore points to the\r\ncelestial pole. But this is quite incorrect. The Great Pyramid, it is\r\ntrue, is situated close to the latitude of 30°. But the entrance passage\r\ndoes not point exactly to the pole. The inclination was measured by Col.\r\nVyse, and found to be 26° 45'. For six out of the nine pyramids of\r\nGhizeh, Col. Vyse found an _average_ inclination of 26° 47', these\r\ninclinations ranging from 25° 55' (2nd, or pyramid of Mycerinus) to 28° 0'\r\n(9th pyramid).[520] Sir John Herschel gives 3970 B.C. as the probable date\r\nof the erection of the Great Pyramid.[520] At that time the distance of\r\n[Greek: a] Draconis (the Pole Star of that day) from the pole was 3° 44'\r\n25\", so that when on the meridian _below_ the pole (its lower culmination\r\nas it is termed) its altitude was 30° - 3° 44' 25\" = 26° 15' 35\", which\r\nagrees fairly well with the inclination of the entrance passage. Letronne\r\nfound a date of 3430 B.C.; but the earlier date agrees better with the\r\nevidence derived from Egyptology.\r\n\r\nEmerson says--\r\n\r\n  \"I am brother to him who squared the pyramids\r\n  By the same stars I watch.\"\r\n\r\nFrom February 6 to 15, 1908, all the bright planets were visible together\r\nat the same time. Mercury was visible above the western horizon after\r\nsunset, Venus very brilliant with Saturn a little above it, Mars higher\r\nstill, all ranged along the ecliptic, and lastly Jupiter rising in the\r\neast.[521] This simultaneous visibility of all the bright planets is\r\nrather a rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the great improbability of Laplace's original Nebular\r\nHypothesis being true, Dr. See says, \"We may calculate from the\r\npreponderance of small bodies actually found in the solar system--eight\r\nprincipal planets, twenty-five satellites (besides our moon), and 625\r\nasteroids--that the chances of a nebula devoid of hydrostatic pressure\r\nproducing small bodies is about 2{658} to 1, or a decillion decillion\r\n(10{66}){6} to the sixth power, to unity. This figure is so very large\r\nthat we shall content ourselves with illustrating a decillion decillion,\r\nand for this purpose we avail ourselves of a method employed by ARCHIMEDES\r\nto illustrate his system of enumeration. Imagine sand so fine that 10,000\r\ngrains will be contained in the space occupied by a poppy seed, itself\r\nabout the size of a pin's head; and then conceive a sphere described about\r\nour sun with a radius of 200,000 astronomical units[522] ([Greek: a]\r\nCentauri being at a distance of 275,000) entirely filled with this fine\r\nsand. The number of grains of sand in this sphere of the fixed stars would\r\nbe a decillion decillion[523] (10{66}){6}. All these grains of sand\r\nagainst one is the probability that a nebula devoid of hydrostatical\r\npressure, such as that which formed the planets and satellites, will lead\r\nto the genesis of such small bodies revolving about a greatly predominant\r\ncentral mass.\"[524] In other words, it is practically certain that the\r\nsolar system was _not_ formed from a gaseous nebula in the manner\r\noriginally proposed by Laplace. On the other hand, the evolution of the\r\nsolar system from a rotating spiral nebula seems very probable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome one has said that \"the world knows nothing of its greatest men.\" The\r\nname of Mr. George W. Hill will probably be unknown to many of my readers.\r\nBut the late Prof. Simon Newcomb said of him that he \"will easily rank as\r\nthe greatest master of mathematical astronomy during the last quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\"[525] Of Prof. Newcomb himself--also a great\r\nmaster in the same subject--Sir Robert Ball says he was \"the most\r\nconspicuous figure among the brilliant band of contemporary American\r\nastronomers.\"[526]\r\n\r\nAn astronomer is supposed to say, with reference to unwelcome visitors to\r\nhis observatory, \"Who steals my purse steals trash; but he that filches\r\nfrom me my clear nights, robs me of that which not enriches him, and makes\r\nme poor indeed.\"[527]\r\n\r\nCicero said, \"In the heavens there is nothing fortuitous, unadvised,\r\ninconstant, or variable; all there is order, truth, reason, and\r\nconstancy\"; and he adds, \"The creation is as plain a signal of the being\r\nof a God, as a globe, a clock, or other artificial machine, is of a\r\nman.\"[528]\r\n\r\n\"Of all the epigrams attributed rightly or wrongly to Plato, the most\r\nfamous has been expanded by Shelley into the four glorious lines--\r\n\r\n  \"'Thou wert the morning star among the living\r\n    Ere thy pure light had fled,\r\n  Now having died, thou art as Hesperus, giving\r\n    New splendour to the dead.'\"[529]\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster has well said,[530] \"Isaiah furnishes us with a\r\nstriking passage, in which the occupants of the earth and the heavens are\r\nseparately described, 'I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I,\r\neven My hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all _their_ host have I\r\ncommanded' (Isaiah xlv. 12). But in addition to these obvious references\r\nto life and things pertaining to life, we find in Isaiah the following\r\nremarkable passage: 'For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God\r\nHimself that formed the earth and made it; He hath established it, _He\r\ncreated it not_ IN VAIN, He formed _it to be inhabited_' (Isaiah xlv. 18).\r\nHere we have a distinct declaration from the inspired prophet that the\r\n_earth would have been created_ IN VAIN _if it had not been formed to be\r\ninhabited_; and hence we draw the conclusion that as the Creator cannot be\r\nsupposed to have made the worlds of our system and those in the sidereal\r\nsystem in vain, they must have been formed to be inhabited.\" This seems to\r\nthe present writer to be a good and sufficient reply to Dr. Wallace's\r\ntheory that our earth is the only inhabited world in the Universe![531]\r\nSuch a theory seems incredible.\r\n\r\nThe recent discovery made by Prof. Kapteyn, and confirmed by Mr.\r\nEddington, of two drifts of stars, indicating the existence of _two_\r\nuniverses, seems to render untenable Dr. Wallace's hypothesis of the\r\nearth's central position in a single universe.[531]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ADDED IN THE PRESS.\r\n\r\nWhile these pages were in the Press, it was announced, by Dr. Max Wolf of\r\nHeidelberg, that he found Halley's comet on a photograph taken on the\r\nearly morning of September 12, 1909. The discovery has been confirmed at\r\nGreenwich Observatory. The comet was close to the position predicted by\r\nthe calculations of Messrs. Cowell and Crommelin of Greenwich Observatory\r\n(_Nature_, September 16, 1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Aboukir, 287\r\n\r\n  Aboul Hassan, 221\r\n\r\n  Abu Ali al Farisi, 225\r\n\r\n  Abu-Hanifa, 233, 234\r\n\r\n  Abul-fadl, 236\r\n\r\n  Accadians, 250, 252\r\n\r\n  Achernar, 275\r\n\r\n  Aclian, 282\r\n\r\n  Adam, 96, 347\r\n\r\n  Adhad-al-Davlat, 225, 236\r\n\r\n  Adonis, 261\r\n\r\n  Adreaansz, 342\r\n\r\n  Airy, Sir G.
