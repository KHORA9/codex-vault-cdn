VAN NOSTRAND COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n  All rights reserved, including that of translation into\r\n       foreign languages, including the Scandinavian\r\n\r\n\r\n          PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great increase in the use of furs during the past few decades has\r\ncaused the fur dressing and dyeing industry to rise from relative\r\ninsignificance to considerable importance as a branch of applied\r\nchemistry. The past eight years, moreover, have witnessed the virtual\r\ntransference of the leadership in the dressing and dyeing of furs from\r\nEurope to America, and in the quality and variety of products, the\r\ndomestic industry is now in every way the equal of, and in many respects\r\nsuperior to the foreign. The great bulk of American furs which formerly\r\nwere sent to Leipzig, Paris or London to be dressed and dyed, are now\r\nbeing dressed and dyed in this country.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these facts, very little is generally known about the nature\r\nand manner of the work constituting the dressing and dyeing of furs.\r\nEven among members of other branches of the fur trade, there is very\r\nlittle accurate information on the subject. Real knowledge concerning fur\r\ndressing and dyeing is possessed only by those actually engaged in the\r\nindustry. The interest and efforts of scientists and technologists have\r\nbeen enlisted to only a small extent in the technical development of the\r\nindustry. The reason for this may be attributed to two related causes:\r\nfirst, the almost monastic seclusion in which fur dressers and dyers,\r\nparticularly the latter, conducted their operations, and even to-day the\r\nheavy cloud of mystery is being dispelled but very slowly; and second,\r\nas a consequence of the first, the lack of any reliable literature on\r\nthe subject. Of the few books which have been written on the industry\r\nof fur dressing and fur dyeing (all of them either German or French),\r\nmost are hopelessly out of date, or contain no trustworthy data; or,\r\nif they do have real merit, they cannot be obtained. Numerous articles\r\nin the technical journals are of interest, but they contain very little\r\ninformation of value.\r\n\r\nThis work is intended for a two-fold purpose: first, that it may serve as\r\na text-book for those who expect to make fur dressing and dyeing their\r\nvocation. The fundamental principles upon which the industry is based\r\nare discussed in the light of the most recent chemical and technical\r\ndevelopments, and the most important operations are treated fully and\r\nsystematically, and are illustrated with practical examples.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as a practical handbook for the worker in the fur dressing and\r\ndyeing plant. The latest factory processes and methods are described, and\r\nnumerous working formulas given. The formulas are all such as have been\r\nsuccessfully used on a large scale, and give satisfactory results when\r\napplied under the proper conditions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it is believed that the book will prove of interest to\r\nchemists and other students of industrial chemistry, since it will be an\r\nintroduction into a field of applied chemistry, about which very little\r\nis known to those outside of the industry.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to Dr. L.

It\r\nis the furrier, therefore, who uses the great bulk of furs, and requires\r\nthem to be dressed and dyed.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the dressing and the dyeing of furs, there are, broadly\r\nspeaking, two fundamental subjects to be considered: first, the raw\r\nmaterials employed, which are, of course, the skins or pelts as they\r\ncome from the trapper. (Other substances used in fur dressing and dyeing\r\nare accessories, and will be studied in connection with the processes.)\r\nSecond, all those operations, physical and chemical, manual and\r\nmechanical, to which the raw skins have to be subjected in order to obtain\r\nthe finished fur, ready for use by the furrier.\r\n\r\nNext to the inherent qualities of the fur skin, the future value of a\r\nfur in a manufactured garment depends largely on the dressing and dyeing\r\nit receives. It is in these operations that the beauty of the fur can\r\nbe brought out to its fullest degree, and if possible, enhanced, or the\r\nattractive features can be marred or destroyed, and the fur rendered\r\nquite worthless. Therefore, it is quite essential for the fur dresser\r\nand the fur dyer in addition to the technical knowledge and experience\r\nwhich are the fundamental requisites of the industry, also to have more\r\nthan a superficial familiarity with the various kinds of furs. In fact,\r\nan accurate knowledge of the nature and chief characteristics of furs\r\nin general, and of the individual classes, in particular, is almost\r\nindispensable to obtain the best results. The habits and habitats of\r\nthe various fur-bearing animals are factors which largely determine the\r\nconstitution of the fur, and the nature of the skin. There are as many\r\ndifferent kinds of fur hair, with as many different kinds of skin bearing\r\nthe hair, as there are classes of furs. The methods of dressing, and\r\noften, if the furs are to be dyed, the manner of dyeing, are determined\r\nby the nature of these component parts of furs. Various chemicals affect\r\nfurs in widely different ways. The divergence with regard to the physical\r\nand chemical properties of the classes of furs is such as to make almost\r\nimperative a detailed knowledge of the typical members of the many groups\r\nof commercial furs.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there are many engaged in the dressing and dyeing of furs,\r\nwho never made a formal study of this phase of the industry, but acquired\r\ntheir knowledge empirically, and are apparently quite successful. It\r\nmust not be denied, that practise and experience, as in every field of\r\nenterprise, are essential to obtaining the best results. But the time and\r\ncost of acquiring this precious experience can be considerably reduced by\r\nsystematically studying the important characteristics and properties of\r\nfurs. These will be treated briefly, but in sufficient detail to form a\r\nbasis for discussing the operations of dressing and dyeing.\r\n\r\nFur-bearing animals are mammals whose skins are used in the manufacture of\r\nfur garments and other fur wearing apparel. The skin, when it is removed\r\nfrom the animal is called a pelt, or sometimes, in the case of large\r\nanimals, a hide. The pelt, after having been dressed and dyed, is called\r\na fur, the skin part being referred to as the leather, and the hair as the\r\npelage. However, this terminology is not strictly adhered to in practise,\r\nand the various terms are often employed interchangeably.\r\n\r\nThe various fur-bearing animals differ considerably in the characteristics\r\nof the furs they yield. With few exceptions, notably beaver and Alaska red\r\nfox, the depth of shade increases as the habitat of the animal species is\r\nnearer the equatorial regions. There seems to be a direct relationship\r\nbetween the intensity of color of the pelt, and the distance from, or\r\nproximity to the polar, or the torrid regions. Thus, white mammals, such\r\nas polar bear, ermine, white or Siberian hare, are found only in the\r\nnorthern lands. An exception is the sheep, which, due to its domestic\r\nnature, can be found in almost all parts of the civilized world. Tropical\r\nanimals on transportation to colder climates, have been known to become\r\nlighter-haired when adapted to their new environment. The skins of animals\r\nliving in dense woods or forests, are generally of a deeper color than\r\nin animals living in more open territory. As a general rule, fur-bearing\r\nanimals have darker hair on the back than on the sides and belly. The\r\nbadger, hamster, ratel and panda are exceptions having the darker hair on\r\nthe belly and sides, and the lighter hair on the back. With regard to the\r\nintensity of color, the skunk has the blackest fur, although some domestic\r\ncats are also quite black. Other animals whose fur is nearly black, are\r\nthe black bear, and the black fox, which is a variety of the silver fox,\r\nbut the color is often of a brownish shade. The colors which predominate\r\namong animals of the fur-bearing variety, are white, black, brown, and\r\ngrey. Less common are yellow shades, and those known as blue.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the fur on all mammals improves with cold, and animals\r\nliving at greater altitudes, with correspondingly lower temperatures,\r\nhave thicker and finer hair than those living nearer sea-level. A cold\r\nwinter generally produces fur of high quality and fine color, a mild\r\nwinter may cause the hair to be inferior. In all climates, animals found\r\nin dense woods, have fur which is deeper, silkier, thicker, and glossier\r\nthan that of animals living in the open. Animals inhabiting inland lakes\r\nand rivers, have finer and softer hair than those living near the coast\r\nor land exposed to sea winds. In general, the hair of animals of the cold\r\nregions is short, fine, soft, and downy, while the hair of animals of\r\nwarmer lands, is longer, stiffer, and harder.\r\n\r\nBoth the quality and color of the fur vary with the age of the animal.\r\nThe young usually have a thicker coat of fur than adults, but the hair is\r\ntoo soft, and the skin generally too tender to be fit for use. In certain\r\ncases, particularly the baby lambs, very young skins are especially\r\nprized, and eagerly sought, but extraordinary care has to be exercised in\r\nworking with them. Fur is at its best when the animal is between one and\r\ntwo years old. After this age, the fur becomes coarse and scraggy. The\r\nanimal attains its fullest growth of hair usually in the height of winter,\r\nand the fur is best between then and very early spring. Before mid-winter\r\nthe hair is short and thin, and in the spring it begins to shed, and will\r\ncontinue to fall out even in the dressed fur. The color of the hair also\r\nbecomes lighter with age, and the new growth which generally comes in the\r\nfall is darker than the old coat.\r\n\r\nDifferent members of the same species, will, other factors such as age\r\nand season being equal, vary as to color and quality. There may even be\r\nseveral different color phases of the same species of animal, such as the\r\ncross fox and the silver fox, both of which are of the same genus as the\r\nred fox; black muskrats are of the same class as the brown variety, etc.\r\nThe individual pelt likewise presents many variations in color and nature\r\nof the hair. In some parts, the hair is thicker and softer than others,\r\nand the color varies in intensity and shade throughout the different\r\nsections of the skin.\r\n\r\nFurs do not have differences confined to the hair part only; the leather\r\nalso presents considerable variation among the different fur-bearing\r\nanimals, especially in regard to the weight and thickness. The durability\r\nof furs, relatively considered under similar conditions of wear, also\r\nvaries widely. In the following table the relative durability of dressed\r\nfurs, and in certain instances also dyed furs, otter being taken as\r\nstandard, is given, as well as the weight in ounces per square foot of\r\nskin of these furs.\r\n\r\n           _Name of Fur_             _Durability_    _Wt. in oz.\r\n                                     _Otter = 100_   per sq. ft._\r\n  Astrachan                                10           3\r\n  Bear, brown or black                     94           7\r\n  Beaver, natural                          90           4\r\n  Beaver, plucked                          85           3-7/8\r\n  Chinchilla                               15           1-1/2\r\n  Civet cat                                40           2-3/4\r\n  Coney                                    20           3\r\n  Ermine                                   25           1-1/4\r\n  Fox, natural                             40           3\r\n  Fox, dyed black                          25           3\r\n  Genet                                    35           2-3/4\r\n  Goat                                     15           4-1/8\r\n  Hare                                     05           2-1/4\r\n  Krimmer                                  60           3\r\n  Kolinsky                                 25           3\r\n  Leopard                                  75           4\r\n  Lynx                                     25           2-3/4\r\n  Marten, Baum natural                     65           2-3/4\r\n  Marten, Baum blended                     45           2-3/4\r\n  Marten, Stone natural                    45           2-7/8\r\n  Marten, Stone dyed                       35           2-7/8\r\n  Mink, natural                            70           3-1/4\r\n  Mink, dyed                               35           3-1/4\r\n  Mink, Jap                                20           3\r\n  Mole                                     07           1-3/4\r\n  Muskrat                                  45           3-1/4\r\n  Nutria, plucked                          25           3-1/4\r\n  Opossum, natural                         37           3\r\n  Opossum, dyed                            20           3\r\n  Opossum, Australian                      40           3-1/2\r\n  Otter, land                             100           4-1/2\r\n  Otter, sea                              100           4-1/2\r\n  Persian lamb                             65           3-1/4\r\n  Pony, Russian                            35           3-1/2\r\n  Rabbit                                   05           2-1/4\r\n  Raccoon, natural                         65           2-1/4\r\n  Raccoon, dyed                            50           2-1/2\r\n  Sable                                    60           2-1/2\r\n  Sable, blended                           45           2-1/2\r\n  Seal, fur                                80           3-1/2\r\n  Seal, fur dyed                           70           3-1/8\r\n  Skunk, tipped                            50           2-7/8\r\n  Squirrel, grey                           20–25        1-3/4\r\n  Wolf, natural                            50           6-1/2\r\n  Wolverine                               100           7\r\n\r\nIn estimating the value of a fur, many factors have to be considered.\r\nThere is no one standard by which the skins are judged, each kind of\r\nfur having its own criterion. However, the general points by which raw\r\nfurs are graded are, color, size, origin, quality and quantity of hair,\r\ncondition of leather, date or season of trapping, methods of handling,\r\netc. Beaver, for example, is graded as large, medium, small and cubs.\r\nRed foxes, first, into Alaska, Labrador, and Nova Scotia, and then these\r\ndivisions are classed as large, medium and small. Skunks are graded\r\naccording to the amount of white on the skin, the less white, the more\r\nvaluable the fur.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which make a fur desired depend first of all on the nature\r\nof the fur itself. Pretty color, luster, thickness, softness, length,\r\nuniformity and regular fall of the hair are the chief points to be\r\nconsidered. While the leather part of the fur is of secondary importance\r\nin the evaluation of a fur, it must possess strength, lightness of weight,\r\nand when properly dressed, should be supple and have a certain firmness or\r\n‘feel.’ The abundance or scarcity of a fur-bearing animal also determines\r\nthe value of the fur. Furs which are always comparatively rare, such as\r\nsilver fox, Russian sable, chinchilla, etc., are always highly prized.\r\nIn this connection, circumstances which tend to decrease the number of\r\navailable pelts of any particular animal, such as pestilences, gradual\r\nextermination due to excessive trapping, prevention of trapping, by\r\nprotective laws, also affect the value of a fur. A third factor which has\r\nan influence on the value of furs, is the prevailing style or fashion.\r\nMany kinds of furs which are both beautiful and rare, such as Russian\r\nsable or chinchilla, are practically unaffected by the whims of fashion.\r\nBut a fur of ordinary value may at times become so popular, that the\r\ndemand for it will cause its price to be greatly increased. Similarly, a\r\nfur which has enjoyed a considerable vogue, may pass out of demand for a\r\ntime and consequently depreciate in value.\r\n\r\nA detailed description of the various furs used in commerce is not within\r\nthe scope of this work, because such an account rightly belongs in a book\r\non zoölogy. However, it is desirable that the reader who is interested\r\nin the dressing and dyeing of furs should have at least a passing\r\nacquaintance with the chief furs used in commerce, together with such of\r\ntheir individual characteristics as are of importance. The figures given\r\nare for the average dressed skin.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Descriptions after W. S. Parker, Deputy Chairman, Fur Section of\r\n      London Chamber of Commerce, in Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th Ed.\r\n\r\n~Astrachan~, see Lambs.\r\n\r\n~Badger.~--2 × 1 ft. This is one of the few animals whose fur is darker\r\non the belly than on the back. The American sorts have coarse, thick\r\nunder-hair of a pale fawn or stone color, with a growth of longer black\r\nand white hairs 3–4 inches long. The Japanese varieties are usually dyed\r\nfor imitation skunk. The American kind is also dyed occasionally but is\r\nmostly used natural. Badger hair is very extensively used for ‘pointing.’\r\n\r\n~Bear, Black.~--6 × 3 ft. Has fine, dark brown under-hair, with bright,\r\nflowing black top-hair 4 inches long. The fur of cubs is nearly as long,\r\nalthough the skins are much smaller, and the hair is finer, softer, and\r\nlighter-pelted. The best skins are from Canada.\r\n\r\n~Bear, Brown.~--6 × 3 ft. Similar to the Black Bear, but more limited in\r\nnumber. The color ranges from a light yellow to a rich dark brown. The\r\nbest and most valuable sorts come from the Hudson Bay territory, inferior\r\nskins coming from Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n~Bear, White.~--10 × 5 ft. This is the largest of the bears. The hair is\r\nshort and close except on the flanks, while the color ranges from white\r\nto yellow. The best skins come from Greenland, the whitest being the most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n~Beaver.~--3 × 2 ft. This is the largest of the rodents, and is very\r\nwidely used; formerly to a great extent in the hat trade. The under-hair\r\nis close and of a bluish-brown hue, and nearly an inch deep. The over-hair\r\nis coarse, bright black or reddish-brown in color, and is usually plucked\r\nout, as the under-hair is the attractive part of the fur. The darkest\r\nskins are the most valuable. Formerly beaver was used to dye in imitation\r\nof seal, but more suitable furs are now used.\r\n\r\n~Broadtail~, see Lambs.\r\n\r\n~Caracul~, see Lambs.\r\n\r\n~Cat, Civet.~--9 × 4-1/2 inches, with short, thick and dark under-hair,\r\nand silky, black top-hair with irregular white markings. It is similar\r\nto the skunk, but is lighter, softer, less full, and has no disagreeable\r\nodor.\r\n\r\n~Cat, House.~--18 × 9 inches. Is mostly black and dark brown, the best\r\nskins coming from Holland. The hair is weak, coming out with the friction\r\nof wear. In the trade, the black variety is known as genet.\r\n\r\n~Chinchilla.~--12 × 7 inches. This is one of the rarest and most beautiful\r\nfurs. It comes from Bolivia and Peru, where, due to the uncontrolled\r\ntrapping of the animal, it is becoming scarce, and this compelled the\r\ngovernments to enact laws prohibiting the taking of chinchilla for a\r\ncertain period. The fur is of a delicate blue-grey, with black shadings,\r\nthe fur being 1–1-1/4 inches deep. Unfortunately, the skin is quite\r\nperishable.\r\n\r\n~Chinchilla, La Plata.~--9 × 4 inches. Incorrectly called “bastard\r\nchinchilla” in the trade. It is a similar species to the Bolivian\r\nchinchilla, but due to the lower altitude and warmer climate of its\r\nhabitat, is smaller, with shorter and less pretty hair, the color of the\r\nunder-hair being darker, and of the top-hair less pure. It is quite as\r\nundurable as true chinchilla.\r\n\r\n~Chinchillone.~--13 × 8 inches. Is also from South America. The fur is\r\nlonger, weaker, poorer and yellower than real chinchilla, but the skins\r\nare often dyed in shades closely resembling the natural chinchilla.\r\n\r\n~Ermine.~--12 × 2-1/2 inches. The under-hair is short and even, with the\r\ntop-hair slightly longer. The leather is light, close in texture, and\r\nquite durable. In mid-winter the color is pure white, except the tip of\r\nthe tail, which is usually quite black. The best skins are from Siberia.\r\n\r\n~Fisher.~--30 × 12 inches, with tail 12–18 inches long. It is the largest\r\nof the marten family. The under-hair is deep, and of a dark shade, with\r\na fine dark, glossy and strong top-hair, 2 or more inches long. The best\r\nskins are from Canada. The fur is something like a dark silky raccoon,\r\nwhile the tail, which is very highly prized, is almost black.\r\n\r\n~Fitch.~--12 × 3 inches. It is of the marten species, and its common name\r\nis polecat. The under-hair is yellow and 1/3 of an inch deep. The top-hair\r\nis black, 1-1/2–1-3/4 inches long, very fine and open in growth, and not\r\nso close as the martens. The largest and best skins are from Denmark,\r\nHolland and Germany. The Russian skins are smaller, silkier, and are\r\nusually dyed as a substitute for sable.\r\n\r\n~Fox, Blue.~--24 × 8 inches. The under-hair is thick and long, while the\r\ntop-hair is fine and not so plentiful as in other foxes. It is found in\r\nAlaska, Hudson Bay Territory, Greenland and Archangel. Although called\r\nblue, the color is really of a slaty or drab shade. The skins from\r\nArchangel are more silky and of a smoky bluish color, and being scarce are\r\nmost valuable. The white foxes which are dyed a smoky blue are brilliant\r\nand quite unlike the browner shades of the blue-fox.\r\n\r\n~Fox, Cross.~--20 × 7 inches. The skins generally have a pale yellow or\r\norange tone, with some silver points, and a darkish cross marking on the\r\nshoulders, on account of which the animal got its name. Some are very\r\nsimilar to the pale red foxes of Northwest America. The darkest and best\r\nskins are from Labrador and Hudson Bay, those from lower latitudes being\r\ninferior.\r\n\r\n~Fox, Grey.~--27 × 10 inches. Has a close dark drab under-hair, with\r\ncoarse regular, yellowish, grizzly-grey top-hair. The majority of the\r\nskins come from Virginia and southwestern U. S. A. Those from the west\r\nare larger and brighter-toned.\r\n\r\n~Fox, Kit.~--20 × 6 inches. The under-hair is short and soft, as is also\r\nthe top-hair, which is a very pale grey mixed with some yellowish-white\r\nhairs. It is the smallest of the foxes, and is found in Canada and\r\nnorthern United States.\r\n\r\n~Fox, Red.~--24 × 8 inches, although some kinds are larger. The under-hair\r\nis long and soft, and the top-hair is plentiful and strong. The colors\r\nrange from pale yellow to a dark red, some being very brilliant. It\r\nis widely found in northern America, China, Japan, and Australia. The\r\nKamchatka foxes are exceptionally fine and rich in quality. Farther north,\r\nnear the open sea, the fur is coarse. The skins have an extensive use,\r\nboth natural and dyed. They are dyed black in imitation of the black\r\nfox, or these when pointed with badger or other white hair to imitate the\r\nsilver fox.\r\n\r\n~Fox, Silver.~--30 × 10 inches. The under-hair is close and fine, and the\r\ntop-hair, which is black to silvery, is 3 inches long. The fur on the neck\r\nusually runs almost black, and in some cases the black extends over half\r\nthe length of the skin. When all black, it is a natural black fox, and\r\nis exceedingly rare and high-priced. The silver fox is very valuable, the\r\nfinest wild skins coming from Labrador. The tail is always tipped white.\r\nThe majority of the silver fox pelts that reach the market today are bred\r\non ranches in Canada and the United States.\r\n\r\n~Fox, White.~--20 × 7 inches. It is usually small and inhabits the extreme\r\nnorthern sections of Hudson Bay, Labrador, Greenland, and Siberia. The\r\nCanadian are silky-haired and inclined to a creamy color, while the\r\nSiberian are whiter and more woolly. The under-hair is generally of a\r\nbluish-grey tone, but the top-hair in winter is usually full enough\r\nto hide such a variation. Those skins which have under-hair that is\r\nquite white are rare and much more expensive than the others. In summer\r\nspecimens of these species have slightly discolored coats, the shades\r\nresembling those of the blue fox. The skins which are not perfectly white\r\nare bleached, or if they cannot be bleached sufficiently white they are\r\ndyed various shades of smoke color, blue-greys and also imitation blue\r\nfox.\r\n\r\n~Goat.~--The size varies greatly. The European, Arabian and East Indian\r\nvarieties are used mainly for leather and wool. Many from Russia are dyed\r\nblack for rugs. The hair is brittle, with poor under-hair, and is not\r\ndurable. The Chinese export many skins in grey, black and white, made into\r\nrugs of two skins each. Frequently the skins are dyed black or brown in\r\nimitation of bear.\r\n\r\n~Hamster.~--8 × 3-1/2 inches. A destructive rodent found largely in Russia\r\nand Germany. The fur is very flat and poor, of a yellowish-brown color,\r\nwith a little marking of black. On account of its lightness it is used\r\nfor linings; occasionally it is dyed.\r\n\r\n~Hare.~--24 × 9 inches. The common hare of Europe is used mostly for the\r\nhatters’ trade. The white hares of Russia, Siberia, and other northern\r\nregions are the ones mainly used for furs. It is whitest in mid-winter,\r\nand the fur on the flanks is longer than that on the back. The hair is\r\nbrittle and not durable, and the leather is quite as bad. Yet the skins\r\nare used to dye imitations of more than a dozen different furs. The North\r\nAmerican hares are also dyed black and brown.\r\n\r\n~Kangaroo.~--The sizes vary greatly, the larger kinds being generally\r\nused for making leather. The sorts used for fur are, blue kangaroo, bush\r\nkangaroo, wallaroo, rock wallaby, swamp wallaby, and short-tailed wallaby.\r\nMany of the swamp wallabies are dyed imitation skunk, and look quite\r\nattractive. The colors are generally yellowish or brown, some in the swamp\r\nvariety being dark brown. The skins are quite strong. The rock wallabies\r\nare soft and woolly, and often have a bluish tone. They are used for rugs.\r\n\r\n~Kolinsky.~--12 × 2-1/2 inches. It is of the marten family. The under-hair\r\nis short and rather weak, but regular, as is also the top-hair. The color\r\nis usually a uniform yellow. They are generally dyed in imitation of other\r\nmembers of the marten family. It is very light in weight, and the best\r\nskins are obtained from Siberia. The tails are used for artists’ “sable”\r\nbrushes.\r\n\r\n~Lambs.~--Those of commercial interest are from South Russia, Persia,\r\nand Afghanistan, and include Persian Lamb, Broadtail, Astrachan, Shiraz,\r\nBokhara, Caracul, and Krimmers.\r\n\r\nThe _Persians_ are 18 × 9 inches, and are the finest and best. When\r\nproperly dressed and dyed they should have regular, close, bright curls,\r\nvarying from small to very large and if of equal size, regularity,\r\ntightness and brightness, their value is inestimable.\r\n\r\nAll the above lambs, except krimmer, are naturally a rusty black or brown,\r\nand are in most cases dyed a jet black. Luster cannot be imparted where\r\nnaturally lacking.\r\n\r\n_Broadtails_, 10 × 5 inches, are the young of the Persians, killed\r\nbefore the wool has had time to develop beyond the flat wavy state. They\r\nare naturally of exceedingly light weight, and when of an even pattern\r\npossessing a lustrous sheen are costly. The pelt, however, is too delicate\r\nto resist hard wear.\r\n\r\n_Astrachan_, _Shiraz_, and _Bokhara_ lambs, 22 × 9 inches, are of\r\na coarser and looser curl. Caracul lambs are the very young of the\r\nastrachan, and the finest skins are almost as effective as the broadtails,\r\nalthough not so fine in texture.\r\n\r\n_Krimmers_, 24 × 10 inches are grey lambs obtained from Crimea. They are\r\nof a similar nature to the caraculs, but looser in curl, and ranging in\r\ncolor from a very light to a dark grey, the best being pale bluish-greys.\r\n\r\n_Slink lambs_ come from South America and China. The South American are\r\nvery small, and generally those are still-born. They have a particularly\r\nthin pelt, with very close wool of minute curls. The Chinese sorts are\r\nmuch larger.\r\n\r\n~Leopard.~--3 × 6 feet long. There are several kinds, the chief being the\r\nsnow leopard or ounce, Chinese, Bengal, Persian, East Indian, and African.\r\nThe first variety inhabits the Himalayas, and has a deep, soft fur, quite\r\nlong as compared with the Bengal sort. The colors are pale orange and\r\nwhite with dark markings. The Chinese are of a medium orange-brown color\r\nand full in fur. The East Indian are less full and not so dark; the Bengal\r\nare dark and medium in color with short, hard hair. The African are small,\r\nwith pale lemon-colored ground, and very closely marked with black spots.\r\n\r\n~Lynx.~--45 × 20 inches. The under-hair is thinner than in the fox, but\r\nthe top-hair is fine, silky and flowing, 4 inches long, of a pale grey,\r\nslightly mottled with fine streaks and dark spots. The fur on the flank\r\nis longer, and white, with very pronounced markings of dark spots, and\r\nthis part of the skin is generally worked separately. Skins with a bluish\r\ntone are more valuable than those with a sandy or reddish hue. The lynx\r\ninhabits North America as far south as California. The best skins come\r\nfrom Hudson Bay, and also Sweden. They are generally dyed black or brown,\r\nsimilar to dyed fox.\r\n\r\n~Marmot.~--18 × 12 inches. A rodent found largely in the south of\r\nGermany. The fur is yellowish-brown, rather harsh and brittle, and without\r\nunder-hair. Also found in North America, China, and the best skins come\r\nfrom Russia. It is dyed brown in imitation of mink or sable, the stripes\r\nusually being put on in the completed garment.\r\n\r\n~Marten, Baum.~--16 × 5 inches. Also called Pine Marten, and is found in\r\nthe woods and mountains of Russia, Norway, Germany and Switzerland. It\r\nhas a thick under-hair with strong top-hair, and ranges from a pale to a\r\ndark bluish-brown. The best are from Norway, are very durable and of good\r\nappearance, and a good substitute for the American sable.\r\n\r\n~Marten, Japanese.~--16 × 5 inches. It is of a woolly nature with rather\r\ncoarse top-hair, and quite yellow in color. It is dyed, but it is not an\r\nattractive fur, lacking a silky, bright and fresh appearance.\r\n\r\n~Marten, Stone.~--Size and quality similar to the baum marten. The color\r\nof the under-hair is stony white, and the top-hair is a very dark brown,\r\nalmost black. Skins of a pale bluish tone are used natural, while less\r\nclear colored ones are dyed, usually in Russian sable shades. They are\r\nfound in Russia, Bosnia, Turkey, Greece, Germany, and France, the best\r\ncoming from Bosnia and France.\r\n\r\n~Mink.~--16 × 5 inches. Is of the amphibious class, and is found\r\nthroughout North America, as well as in Russia, China and Japan. The\r\nunder-hair is short, close and even, as is also the top-hair, which is\r\nvery strong. The best skins are very dark, and come from Nova Scotia. In\r\nthe central states the color is a good brown, but in the northwest and\r\nsouthwest, the fur is coarse and pale. It is very durable and an economic\r\nsubstitute for sable. The Russian species is dark, but poor and flat in\r\nquality, and the Chinese and Japanese sorts are so pale that they are\r\nalways dyed.\r\n\r\n~Mole.~--3-1/2 × 2-1/2 inches. Is plentiful in the British Isles and\r\nEurope, and is much in demand on account of its velvety fur of a pretty\r\nbluish shade. Although the skins are comparatively cheap, the cost of\r\ndressing is high on account of the considerable amount of labor involved.\r\nThe pelt is very light in weight, but does not resist well the friction\r\nof wear.\r\n\r\n~Monkey, Black.~--18 × 10 inches. The species usually found on the west\r\ncoast of Africa, is the one of interest to the fur trade. The hair is very\r\nlong, very black and bright, with no under-hair, and the white pelt is\r\nvery noticeable by contrast.\r\n\r\n~Muskrat, Brown, Black, Russian.~--12 × 8 inches. A very prolific rodent\r\nof the amphibious class, obtained in Canada and the United States. It has\r\na fairly thick and even brownish under-hair, and a rather strong, dark\r\ntop-hair of medium density. It is a durable and not too heavy fur. It\r\nis used natural, but recently the plucked, sheared and dyed skins have\r\nfound a very extensive use as Hudson seal, an imitation of real seal. The\r\nso-called black variety of muskrat is found in New Jersey and Delaware,\r\nbut only in comparatively small numbers. The Russian is also very small\r\nand limited in numbers. It is of a pretty silvery-blue shade with even\r\nunder-hair, with very little silky top-hair, and silvery-white sides,\r\npresenting altogether a marked effect.\r\n\r\n~Nutria.~--20 × 12 inches. Is a rodent about half the size of the beaver,\r\nand when plucked, has only about half the depth of fur, which is not so\r\nclose. It is often dyed a seal color, but its woolly nature renders it\r\nless effective than the dyed muskrat. The skins are obtained from northern\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n~Opossum, American.~--18 × 10 inches. Is a marsupial, the only one of\r\nits class found outside of Australia. The under-hair is of a very close\r\nfrizzy nature, and nearly white, with long bluish-grey top-hair mixed with\r\nsome black. It is found in central sections of the United States, and is\r\nfrequently dyed imitation skunk.\r\n\r\n~Opossum, Australian.~--16 × 8 inches. Is of a totally different nature\r\nfrom the American. Although it has fur-hair and top-hair, the latter is\r\nsparse and fine, so that the fur coat may be considered one of close even\r\nunder-hair. The color varies according to the district of origin, from\r\nblue-grey to yellow with reddish tones.\r\n\r\nThose from near Sidney are a light clear blue, while those from Victoria\r\nare a dark iron-grey, and stronger in the fur-hair. The most pleasing\r\nshade of grey comes from Adelaide. The reddest are the cheapest. The\r\nring-tailed opossum, 7 × 4 inches, has a very short, close and dark grey\r\nunder-fur, some almost black, but the skins are not used extensively.\r\nThe Tasmanian opossum, grey and black, 20 × 10 inches, is of a similar\r\ndescription, but larger, darker, and stronger in the under-hair.\r\n\r\n~Otter, River.~--The size varies considerably, as does also the length of\r\nthe fur, according to the origin. It is found in greatest numbers in the\r\ncoldest northern regions, and with the best under-hair, the top-hair being\r\nunimportant, as it is plucked out. Most of the best river otters come\r\nfrom Canada and the United States, and average 36 × 18 inches. The skins\r\nfrom Germany and China are smaller and shorter furred. The colors of the\r\nunder-hair vary from very dark brown to almost yellow. Both the fur and\r\nthe leather are extremely strong, and many skins are dyed imitation seal\r\nafter plucking.\r\n\r\n~Otter, Sea.~--50 × 25 inches. Is one of the most beautiful of furs.\r\nThe under-hair is of a rich, dense, silky nature, with short and soft\r\ntop-hair, which is not plucked. The colors range from a pale grey-brown\r\nto a rich black, and many skins have a sprinkling of white or silver-white\r\nhairs. The blacker the under-hair, and the more regular the silver points,\r\nthe more valuable is the skin.\r\n\r\n~Pony, Russian.~--This is a comparatively cheap, but very serviceable\r\nfur, and possesses some very desirable qualities. It has a thin leather,\r\nbut is also scantily haired. Young pelts have a design on them somewhat\r\nsimilar to broadtail lambs, or moire astrachans, but this design is lost\r\nto a considerable degree by dyeing the furs. The hair, which is very\r\nglossy, is generally dyed black, although the natural pelts are also worn\r\nextensively.\r\n\r\n~Rabbit.~--10 × 16 inches. The fur is thick and fine, but the pelt is very\r\nweak. It is a native of central Europe, Asia, North and South America,\r\nNew Zealand and Australia. The color ranges from white to black. France,\r\nBelgium and Australia are the greatest producers of rabbits suitable for\r\ndyeing black, the so-called French seal, for which they are mostly used.\r\nAt the present time the dyeing of rabbits constitutes a considerable\r\npercentage of the total fur-dyeing operations in this country. The most\r\nvaried shades are produced on rabbit, and it probably is the basis of\r\nthe greatest number of dyed imitations of better furs. In addition to the\r\nFrench seal, or sealine, rabbit is dyed in imitation of beaver, mole, etc.\r\n\r\n~Raccoon.~--20 × 12 inches. Varies considerably in size, quality and color\r\nof the fur, according to the part of North America in which it is found.\r\nThe under-hair is 1–1-1/2 inches deep, pale brown, with long top-hair\r\nof a dark and silvery-grey mixture of a grizzly type, the best having a\r\nbluish tone, and the cheapest a yellowish or reddish-brown. The best skins\r\ncome from the northern part of the United States. The skins have a wide\r\nuse natural, but are also dyed dark blue, or imitation skunk, the latter\r\nbeing a very effective and attractive substitute, and extensively used.\r\nSometimes the skins are plucked, and if the under-hair is good, the effect\r\nis similar to a beaver.\r\n\r\n~Sable, American and Canadian.~--17 × 5 inches. The skins are sold in the\r\ntrade as martens, but since many of the skins are of a very dark color,\r\nand almost as silky as Russian sable, they have come to be known as sable.\r\nThe prevailing color is a medium brown, while many are quite yellow. These\r\npale skins have been dyed so well that they can cheaply substitute Russian\r\nsable. The finest skins are from the Eskimo Bay and Hudson Bay districts,\r\nthe poorest from Alaska.\r\n\r\n~Sable, Russian.~--15 × 5 inches. Belongs to a species of marten similar\r\nto the European and American, but much more silky in the texture of the\r\nfur. The under-hair is close, fine and very soft, the top-hair is regular,\r\nfine and flowing, and silky, ranging from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 inches in depth.\r\nIn color they vary from a pale stony or yellowish shade to a rich, almost\r\nblack, dark brown, with a bluish tone. The leather is exceedingly close\r\nand fine in texture, very light in weight, and very durable. The Yakutsk,\r\nOkhotsk, and Kamchatka sorts are good, the last being the largest and\r\nfullest-furred, but of less color density than the others. The most\r\nvaluable, are the darkest from Yakutsk in Siberia, particularly those\r\nhaving silvery hairs evenly distributed over the skin, but these furs are\r\nvery rare.\r\n\r\nThe Amur skins are paler, but often of a pretty, bluish tone, with many\r\ninterspersed silvery hairs. The fur is not so close or deep, but is very\r\neffective nevertheless. The paler skins from all districts are now tipped,\r\nthe tips of the hair being stained dark, the fastest dyes being used, and\r\nonly an expert can detect them as differing from the natural shades.\r\n\r\n~Seal, Fur.~--The sizes range from 24 × 15 inches to 15 × 25 inches,\r\nthe width being the widest part of the skin after dressing. The most\r\nuseful skins are the pups 42 inches long, the quality being very good and\r\nuniform. The largest skins, known as wigs, and ranging up to 8 feet in\r\nlength, are uneven and weak in the fur. The supply of the best sort is\r\nchiefly from the northern Pacific, Pribilof Islands, Alaska, northwest\r\ncoast of America, Aleutian Islands, and Japan. Other kinds are taken from\r\nthe south Pacific regions. The dressing and dyeing of seal takes longer\r\nthan for any other fur, but when finished, it has a fine, rich effect,\r\nand is very durable.\r\n\r\n~Seal, Hair.~--This is chiefly used for its oil and leather, and not for\r\nits fur. It has coarse, rigid hair, and no under-hair.\r\n\r\n~Skunk, or “Black Marten.”~--15 × 8 inches. The under-hair is full, and\r\nfairly close, with glossy, flowing top-hair about 2-1/2 inches long. The\r\nmajority of the skins have two stripes of white hair extending the whole\r\nlength of the skin. These were formerly cut out, but more recently are\r\ndyed the same color as the rest of the skin. They are widely found in\r\nNorth and South America. The best are from Ohio and New York. The skunk\r\nis naturally the blackest fur, is silky and very durable.\r\n\r\n~Squirrel.~--10 × 5 inches. This size refers to the Russian and Siberian\r\ntypes, which are practically the only kind imported for fur, other species\r\nhaving too poor a fur to be of great commercial interest. The back of the\r\nRussian squirrel has an even, close fur, varying from a clear bluish-grey\r\nto a reddish-brown, the bellies in the former being of a flat quality and\r\nwhite, in the latter, yellowish. The backs are worked up separately from\r\nthe bellies. The pelts, though light in weight, are tough and durable.\r\nThe tails are dark and very small, and considerably used.\r\n\r\n~Tiger.~--The size varies, the largest measuring about 10 feet from the\r\nnose to the root of the tail. It is found throughout India, Turkestan,\r\nChina, Mongolia, and the East Indies. Coats of the Bengal variety are\r\nshort and of a dark orange-brown with black stripes. Those from other\r\nparts of India are similar-colored, but longer in hair, while those\r\nfrom the north and China are not only large in size, but have very long\r\nsoft hair of a delicate orange-brown, with very white flanks, and marked\r\ngenerally, with the blackest of stripes.\r\n\r\n~Wolf.~--50 × 25 inches. Is closely allied to the dog family, and very\r\nwidely distributed over the world. The best are the full-furred skins\r\nof a very pale bluish-grey with fine, flowing black top-hair, from the\r\nHudson Bay district. Those from the United States and Asia are harsher and\r\nbrowner. The Siberian is smaller than the North American, and the Russian\r\nstill smaller. A large number of prairie-dogs, or dog-wolves, is also used\r\nfor cheaper furs.\r\n\r\n~Wolverine.~--16 × 18 inches. Is a native of America, Siberia, Russia, and\r\nScandinavia, and is of the general nature of the bear. The under-hair is\r\nfull and thick, with strong, bright top-hair about 2-1/2 inches long. The\r\ncolor is of two or three different shades of brown on one skin, the center\r\nbeing dark, and presenting the general appearance of an oval saddle,\r\nbordered with a rather pale shade of brown, and merging to a darker shade\r\ntowards the flanks. This peculiar character stamps it as a distinguished\r\nfur. It is expensive, and quite valuable on account of its excellent\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n~Wombat, Koala or Australian Bear.~--20 × 12 inches. It has a light grey\r\nor brown, close, thick under-hair 1/2 inch deep, and no top-hair, with a\r\nrather thick, spongy pelt. It is cheap, and well suited for rough wear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF FUR\r\n\r\n\r\nFur is made up of two main components, the hair and the skin, and each of\r\nthese has a very complex structure.\r\n\r\nIn the living animal the skin serves as a protective covering, and also\r\nconstitutes an organ of secretion and of feeling; consequently it is\r\nof a highly complicated nature. The skin of all fur-bearing animals is\r\nessentially the same in structure, although varying considerably as to\r\nthickness and texture. It consists of two principal layers, which are\r\nentirely different in structure and purpose, and correspondingly different\r\nin both physical and chemical respects: the epidermis, epithelium or\r\ncuticle, which is the outer layer, and the dermis or corium, which is the\r\ntrue skin. (Fig. 1A).\r\n\r\nThe epidermis is very thin as compared with the corium. Its outer layer\r\nconsists of a tissue of cells, somewhat analogous to the horny matter\r\nof nails and hair. The inner surface, called the ‘rete malpighi,’ rests\r\non the true skin, and is a soft, mucous layer of cells. These cells are\r\nspherical when first formed, but as they approach the surface become\r\nflattened, and dry up, forming the horny outer layer of the epidermis,\r\nwhich is constantly throwing off the dead scales, and which is constantly\r\nbeing renewed from below. It is from this inner layer of the epidermis\r\nthat the hair, the sweat-glands, and the fat-glands are developed.\r\n\r\nThe corium, or true skin, consists essentially of white, interlacing\r\nfibres of the kind known as connective tissue. These fibres are themselves\r\nmade up of extremely fine smaller fibres, or fibrils, cemented together by\r\na substance of a somewhat different nature from the fibres, the coriin.\r\nTowards the center of the skin, the texture of the interweaving fibres\r\nis looser, becoming much more compact at the surface just beneath the\r\ninner layer of the epidermis. This part of the corium is so exceedingly\r\nclose that the fibrils are scarcely recognizable. It is in this part that\r\nthe fat-glands are situated, while the hair-roots and sweat-glands pass\r\nthrough it into the looser texture of the corium. The surface next to the\r\nflesh is also closer in structure than the middle portions of the skin,\r\nand has somewhat of a membranous character due to the fibres running\r\nalmost parallel to the surface of the skin. The skin is joined to the body\r\nproper by a network of connective tissue, frequently full of fat-cells.\r\nThis layer, together with portions of the flesh which may adhere to it,\r\nis removed by the process called ‘fleshing,’ and this side of the skin\r\nis known as the flesh side. The corium also contains a small proportion\r\nof yellow fibres, known as ‘elastic fibres,’ which differ physically and\r\nchemically from the rest of the skin substance.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the development of the embryo animal, a small group\r\nof cells forms like a bulb on the inner side of the epidermis, above a\r\nknot of very fine blood-vessels in the corium. This group of cells grows\r\ndownward into the true skin, and the hair-root which is formed within it,\r\nsurrounds the capillary blood-vessels, drawing nourishment from them, and\r\nthus forming the papilla. (Fig. 1A). Smaller projections also form on the\r\nbulb, and the fat-glands are gradually developed. The sweat-glands are\r\nformed in a manner similar to the development of hair.\r\n\r\nThe individual hair fibre is quite as complicated in structure as the\r\nskin, and is made up of four distinct parts. (Fig. 1B).[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] Descriptions and figures taken from “Mammal Fur Under the\r\n      Microscope,” by Dr. L. A. Hausman, in _Natural History_,\r\n      Sept.–Oct., 1920.\r\n\r\nThe medulla, or pith, is the innermost portion of the hair, and is\r\ncomposed of many shrunken cells, often connected by a network which may\r\nfill the medullary column partially or wholly.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the medulla is the cortex, which is made up of spindle-shaped\r\ncells fused into a horny, almost homogeneous, transparent mass, and\r\nforming a large proportion of the hair shaft.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the fur-bearing animals, there is distributed within\r\nand among the cells of the cortex a pigment in the form of granules or\r\nminute particles, arranged in the different hairs in fairly definite and\r\ncharacteristic patterns. It is to these pigment granules that the color\r\nof the hair is due primarily. In some cases the coloring matter of the\r\nshaft is uniformly diffused and not granular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1\r\n\r\n_A._ STRUCTURE OF SKIN.\r\n\r\n_B._ STRUCTURE OF HAIR.]\r\n\r\nThe outermost coat of the hair, or cuticle, is composed of thin,\r\ncolorless, transparent scales of varying forms and sizes, and arranged\r\nin series like the shingles of a roof. It is on these scales that the\r\nlustre or gloss of the hair depends. Since lustre is due to the unbroken\r\nreflection of light from the surface of the hair, the smoother the\r\nsurface, the glossier it will appear. When the scales of the cuticle are\r\nirregular and uneven, the surface of the hair will not be uniform and\r\nsmooth, and the light reflected from it will be broken and scattered, and\r\nconsequently the hair will not possess a high degree of lustre. As a rule,\r\nthe stiff, straight hairs have the most regular and uniform arrangement\r\nof the scales of the cuticle, and hence are the smoothest and glossiest.\r\n\r\nFur hairs are in general either circular or elliptical in cross-section,\r\nthose which are circular being straight or only slightly curved, while\r\nthose which are elliptical in cross-section are curly like the hair of\r\nthe various kinds of lambs.\r\n\r\nMost fur-bearing animals have two different kinds of hair on their bodies.\r\nNearest to the skin is a coat of short, thick, soft and fine hair, usually\r\nof a woolly nature, and called the under-hair, under-wool, or fur-hair.\r\nOverlying the fur-hair is a protective layer of hair, longer and coarser\r\nthan the under-hair, and usually straight, hard, smooth and glossy. This\r\nis called the top-hair, over-hair, guard-hair or protective hair. In some\r\nfurs, the top-hair constitutes one of the chief elements of their beauty,\r\nwhile in others, the top-hairs are removed, so as better to display the\r\nattractive features of the under-hair. The roots of the top-hair are\r\ngenerally deeper in the skin than those of the fur-hair, and in some\r\ninstances where the top-hair is removed, as in the seal, the roots are\r\ndestroyed by the action of chemicals applied to the skin side, the roots\r\nof the fur-hair being wholly unaffected by this treatment.\r\n\r\nThe fur-hair and the top-hair in the same animal have different\r\nmedullary and cuticular structures, and these characteristics may be\r\nused to distinguish the two kinds of hair. Figs. 2A and B illustrate\r\nthese differences. In each case, the two large hairs on the left of the\r\nillustration are the guard-hairs, showing respectively the cuticular\r\nscales and the medulla. On the right are the two fur-hairs showing the\r\nscales and the medulla.\r\n\r\nAlthough composed of many different kinds of tissues, and varying so\r\ngreatly in physical structure, both the skin and the hair belong to\r\nthe same class of chemical compounds, namely the proteins. These are\r\nhighly complex substances, forming the basis of all animal and vegetable\r\ntissues. There are many different kinds of proteins, varying somewhat in\r\ntheir constitutions, but all show, on analysis the following approximate\r\ncomposition of chemical elements:\r\n\r\n  Carbon                                50–55%\r\n  Hydrogen                              6.5–7.3%\r\n  Nitrogen                              15–17.6%\r\n  Oxygen                                19–24%\r\n  Sulphur                               0.3–5%\r\n\r\nThe principal kinds of proteins found in the various fur structures\r\nare albumins, keratin, collagen, and mucines. Albumins, of which the\r\nwhite of egg is the most familiar variety, occurs to some extent in the\r\ncorium as serum in the blood-vessels, and also as the liquid filling\r\nthe connective tissues, known as the lymph. They are soluble in cold\r\nwater, but when heated to about 70° C., they coagulate and are then\r\ninsoluble. Concentrated mineral acids and strong alcohol will also effect\r\ncoagulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2\r\n\r\n_A._ HAIR OF EUROPEAN BEAVER.\r\n\r\n_a._ TOP-HAIR. _b._ UNDER-HAIR.\r\n\r\n_B._ HAIR OF SKUNK.\r\n\r\n_a._ TOP-HAIR. _b._ UNDER-HAIR.]\r\n\r\nKeratin is the chief substance of which all horny parts of the animal\r\nbody are composed, such as the hair, nails or hoofs. It is the principal\r\nconstituent of the hair, the epidermis, and the walls of the cells of\r\nthe inner layer of the epidermis, or the ‘rete malpighi.’ Keratin is\r\nparticularly rich in sulphur, and is quite insoluble in cold water.\r\nCaustic alkalies attack keratin-containing parts.\r\n\r\nThe collagens are the principal proteins of the skin, forming largely the\r\nsubstance of the connective tissue fibres, and consequently the framework\r\nof the skin. They are insoluble in cold water, dilute acids and salt\r\nsolutions, and are only very slowly attacked by dilute alkalies. Dilute\r\nacids and alkalies cause collagen to swell; concentrated acids, vegetable\r\ntanning materials, basic chrome or iron salts cause it to shrink. By\r\nboiling with water, dilute acids or dilute alkalies, collagen is split up\r\ninto gelatin or glutin.\r\n\r\nThe mucines of the skin, intercellular material or coriin, are soluble\r\nin dilute acids, in dilute solutions of alkalies and of alkaline earths\r\nsuch as lime, and in 10% salt solution, but insoluble in water, and in\r\nsalt solutions of greater or less concentration than 10%. On drying the\r\nskin, the mucines cement the connective tissue fibres, causing the skin to\r\nbecome stiff, horny and translucent. The mucines are also constituents of\r\nthe cells of the ‘rete malpighi.’ The solubility of the mucines in dilute\r\nsolutions of alkalies and of alkaline earths causes the epidermis to be\r\nloosened from the corium, when the skins are treated with such solutions\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\nWhen raw skins are boiled with water, the greater part goes into solution,\r\nthe residue consisting chiefly of the keratins of the hair and epidermis\r\ncells. On cooling, the solution solidifies to a jelly of gelatine. It\r\ncombines with both acids and alkalies. A property of the skin which is\r\nof importance in the tanning operation of fur-dressing, and a quality\r\nwhich also characterizes gelatine, is the capacity to absorb liquids\r\nand swell up, without changing chemically. Raw pelts swell up easily\r\nin pure cold water, but much more easily in solutions of dilute acids\r\nor dilute alkalies, only a little of the skin material being dissolved.\r\nIn stronger solutions, the skins swell up less, while more of the skin\r\nsubstance dissolves, and by prolonged action of strong acids or alkalies,\r\nan almost complete solution of the skin is obtained, without, however,\r\nany of the material decomposing. With very strong alkalies or acids,\r\nthe skin substance is broken up into simpler compounds, such as various\r\namines and ammonia. The swelling action of acids or of alkalies increases\r\nwith the increase in concentration of the acid or alkali, but only up\r\nto a certain point, after which further increase in the strength of the\r\nacid or alkaline solution causes a reduction in the swelling, and even\r\nproduces shrinkage. In the presence of neutral salts, like common table\r\nsalt, sodium chloride, the swelling action of acids, is reduced, but the\r\naction of alkalies remains practically unaffected.\r\n\r\nWhen treated with the various chemicals, fur hair acts in a manner quite\r\nsimilar to wool. If it be remembered that certain classes of furs are\r\nderived from animals of the sheep family, such furs as Persian lamb,\r\nkrimmer, etc., it becomes apparent why chemicals should affect furs in\r\nnearly the same way as wool. The great majority of furs differ from those\r\nof the sheep family, in possessing much greater resistance to the action\r\nof chemicals. The range is a wide one however, and no exact criterion can\r\nbe adopted. As a general rule, the reactions are most marked with fur-hair\r\nof a woolly nature, so this may be taken as a standard of reference.\r\n\r\nAcids have relatively little action on the hair, when applied in dilute\r\nsolutions. The scales of the cuticle or epithelium are somewhat opened,\r\nthe fibre becoming slightly roughened thereby. Even at high temperatures,\r\nthe hair is quite resistant to the action of dilute acids. Concentrated\r\nacids destroy the hair with the liberation or formation of ammonia,\r\nhydrogen sulphide, and various amino acids. When treated with dilute\r\nacids, the hair, especially if it is of a very woolly nature, retains\r\nconsiderable quantities of acid, this phenomenon being probably due to\r\nthe fixation of the acid by the basic groups in the hair. Nitric acid\r\nproduces a yellow coloration when applied in dilute solution for a short\r\ntime. Sulphurous acid, the acid formed by the burning of sulphur, has a\r\nbleaching action on the hair.\r\n\r\nAlkalies attack the hair, even in dilute solutions, and by longer action\r\ncomplete decomposition sets in, with formation of ammonia and amino-acids.\r\nAmmonium carbonate, soap, and borax are practically harmless in their\r\neffect on the hair. Sodium and potassium carbonates roughen the hair on\r\nprolonged action, even in dilute solutions. Calcium hydroxide on continued\r\naction removes sulphur from the hair, causing it to become brittle.\r\n\r\nSalts of alkalies and alkaline earths do not affect the hair at all.\r\nSalts of the heavy metals on the other hand, are absorbed in appreciable\r\nquantities. From a dilute solution of alum, aluminum hydroxide is absorbed\r\nby the hair, the potassium sulphate remaining in solution. Similarly with\r\ncopper, iron, and chromium salts, the metal oxides are fixed by the fibre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFUR DRESSING\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY AND HISTORICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nFur dressing has a twofold purpose. First of all, the putrefactive\r\nprocesses must be permanently stopped, so that the skin may be\r\npreserved as such, or worked up as some fur garment, without danger of\r\ndecomposition. Having taken measures to assure the endurance or relative\r\npermanency of the pelt, the prime consideration is, of course, the\r\nappearance of the hair. The hair must be so treated that all its inherent\r\nbeauty is brought out to the fullest extent. It must be made clean and\r\nsoft, and all the natural gloss must be preserved, and if possible,\r\nenhanced. The appearance of the leather is relatively unimportant, since\r\nit is not seen after the furs are made into garments. There are, however,\r\ncertain qualities which it is essential for the leather to possess after\r\nbeing dressed, and these are, softness, lightness of weight, elasticity or\r\nstretch, and a certain firmness or ‘feel.’ In other words the important\r\nconsiderations in fur dressing are the employment of means, and the\r\nexercise of care to preserve or even improve those characteristics of the\r\npelt which make it valuable.\r\n\r\nThe dressing of furs has many features in common with the manufacture\r\nof leather, which is a kindred art. But whereas in fur dressing the\r\nprime consideration is the appearance of the hair, and the leather is of\r\nsecondary importance, in the production of leather, the hair plays no part\r\nat all, since it is entirely removed from the pelt. The fundamental points\r\nof resemblance between leather manufacture and fur dressing are in those\r\nprocesses and operations which are concerned with the preservation of the\r\nleather, and rendering it in the proper condition for use.\r\n\r\nBoth leather dressing and fur dressing have an origin which may be\r\nregarded as identical, and which dates back to the haziest periods of\r\nantiquity. In the course of satisfying his needs, primitive man killed\r\nthe animals about him, and thus obtained his food. The killed animal also\r\nfurnished a skin, which after undergoing certain manipulations and other\r\ntreatments, could serve as a protective covering, ornament, or defensive\r\nweapon. Since the skin in its natural state was hardly fit for use because\r\nof its easy tendency to putrefaction, it is evident that man had to find\r\nsome means of preventing this decay in a more or less permanent fashion,\r\nand moreover had to treat the skin so that it would be suitable for use,\r\nby rendering it soft and flexible. The discovery of means to accomplish\r\nthese purposes was probably one of the first great steps forward on the\r\npath of progress and civilization.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences of the use of animal skins in the earliest periods\r\nof antiquity, in fact it is a usage which may be literally regarded as\r\n“old as the hills.” One of the earliest written records of the employment\r\nof the skins of animals as garments, is in the Old Testament, where it\r\nstates, “Unto Adam and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins,\r\nand clothed them.” Numerous other biblical references indicate the use\r\nof animal skins for various purposes, sometimes prepared as leather,\r\nwith the hair removed. Among the Egyptians tanning seems to have been\r\na common occupation. The particularly attractive skins, like those of\r\nthe leopard or panther, were especially prized, and were made up as furs\r\nfor ornamental wear, rugs and decorations. The less valuable skins were\r\nunhaired and made into leather. Although the tanning or leather-producing\r\nprocesses of the Egyptians are quite unknown, numerous figures engraved in\r\nstone afford an indication to some of the manipulatory operations, such\r\nas soaking the skins, fleshing, softening with stones, stretching over\r\na three-legged wooden “horse,” etc. Many articles, made of leather, have\r\nbeen found in the various Egyptian sarcophagi, and all are in a splendid\r\nstate of preservation, after forty centuries, thereby indicating a very\r\nefficient method of dressing animal skins. Likewise, the presence in the\r\nmuseums of various articles, leather and fur, of Assyrian, Phoenician\r\nand Persian origin, tends to show that these peoples also possessed a\r\nconsiderable degree of proficiency in tanning. Frequent references in the\r\nGreek literature show that leopard and lion skins were worn as war cloaks,\r\nand they undoubtedly were properly made. In the _Iliad_ is described an\r\noperation for the preparation of skins for use as garments, and the method\r\nseems to be a sort of chamois dressing.\r\n\r\nThe first method of tanning skins was, in all probability, that of rubbing\r\ninto the skins various fatty materials found close at hand, such as parts\r\nof the animal, fat, brains, milk, excrement, etc., such an operation\r\nconstituting the basis of what is now known as the chamois dressing. One\r\nof the reasons for believing that it was the first process to be used by\r\nprimitive man, is the fact that certain undeveloped tribes and races of\r\nthe present day still dress skins by it. The American Indians, even to\r\nthis day prepare skins by rubbing in, on the flesh side, the brains of\r\nthe animals which furnished the skins. The Eskimos dress skins by rubbing\r\nin animal fats or fish-oil, and subsequently softening and stretching\r\nthe skins with their teeth in place of, or for want of other implements.\r\nUsually, however, variously shaped stones or bones of animals are used\r\nto obtain the proper degree of softness and flexibility. It is true, too,\r\nthat some of the skins dressed in this primitive fashion can scarcely be\r\nexcelled by any dressed with more modern processes and tanning methods.\r\n\r\nThe next step forward in the preparation of animal skins for use was\r\nundoubtedly the utilization of substances found in the earth. Common\r\nsalt, sodium chloride, was the most universally used substance of mineral\r\norigin, just as it is today. Our prehistoric ancestors eventually\r\ndiscovered the preservative action of salt, and applied it to skins.\r\nWhile it was effective, it was not sufficiently permanent, so another\r\nmineral, also of very common and wide occurrence was used in combination\r\nwith the salt, and the result proved quite satisfactory. This second\r\ncommon mineral was alum. The use of alum, which is the basis of numerous\r\ntanning processes to this day, seems to have been quite a popular method\r\nof ancient times. Artemidorus, a Greco-Roman writer, mentions the use\r\nof alum by the Greeks, and the Romans are known to have prepared a soft,\r\nflexible leather called aluta (alum leather), by using it. In view of the\r\nfact that Egypt had extensive deposits of alum, it is believed that the\r\nalum-salt process was employed also by the Egyptians in the preparation\r\nof leather. However, the evidence on this point is not conclusive.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important methods of producing leather, either as such\r\nor on furs, was with the aid of certain vegetable extracts, known as the\r\ntannins, from which the process of tanning gets its name. The discovery\r\nof the value of these materials for converting the decaying raw skin\r\ninto a leather which could be preserved for an almost indefinite length\r\nof time, and which was flexible and soft as desired, was of far-reaching\r\nimportance. For it is only in very recent times that these tannins have\r\nbeen superseded in part by new tanning substances whose use is simpler\r\nand more time-saving. Yet there are unmistakable indications that the\r\ntannins were employed for tanning at a period which reaches back to the\r\ndawn of history. Although it is scarcely probable that the people who\r\nused these materials could have known of the existence or the nature\r\nof the particular substances in the vegetable extracts which actually\r\neffect the tanning action, experience taught them to employ these plants\r\nwhich possessed the highest content of active ingredients, and which,\r\nconsequently, were most effective in use. Tychios, of Boetius, a Greek\r\nsupposed to have lived about 900 B.C. and mentioned in the _Iliad_, is\r\nconsidered the oldest known tanner, and was regarded by Pliny, a Roman\r\nwriter, as the discoverer of tanning, and of the use of the various\r\nvegetable tanning materials. At any rate, the Greeks used the leaves of\r\na so-called tanning-tree, which was probably the sumach. The Egyptians\r\nworked with the acacia, while the Romans used as tanning materials the\r\nbarks of the pine, alder and pomegranate trees, also nut-galls, sumach and\r\nacorns. The Romans were quick to employ methods used by the peoples whom\r\nthey conquered, and it is in this way that they learned the use of many\r\nof the plants mentioned, for tanning purposes.\r\n\r\nMany other ancient peoples had various processes of tanning, the methods\r\nprobably differing in each country. Thus the Chinese, Syrians, and much\r\nlater, the Moors, were each known for proficiency in a certain class\r\nof leather tanning. It has been said that in general, even up to modern\r\ntimes, tanning with nut-galls was the characteristic method of the Orient;\r\nwith oak-tan, that of the Occident, while the use of alum is regarded as\r\nthe method peculiar to the Saracens.\r\n\r\nIn prehistoric times and the early centuries of civilization, skins or\r\npelts were prepared for use by the individual, the work usually being\r\ndone by the housewife and daughters, while the masculine members of the\r\nfamily were engaged in hunting the animals and obtaining the skins. At a\r\nlater period, when people had advanced to the point where they lived in\r\ncities, the preparing or dressing of skins became centered in the hands\r\nof a comparatively small number of people, and thus the work took on the\r\naspects of a trade. The workers in fur were at first the same people who\r\nmade leather out of the skin, for the two kinds of work were very closely\r\nassociated. During the period of the Roman supremacy, historical records\r\nshow that the furriers, who did all the work connected with furs, from\r\npurchasing the raw skins, dressing them, making them into garments, to\r\nselling the latter, were organized into associations together with the\r\nleather workers. After the fall of the Roman empire, and throughout the\r\ncenturies known as the Dark Ages, all traces of the furriers seem to\r\nhave been lost, but in the beginning of the Renaissance period in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries, we again find records of the furriers,\r\nwho were now all members of the furriers’ guilds, also in association\r\nwith the leather workers. As formerly, all the work connected with the\r\nproduction of fur apparel from the raw furs, was done by the master\r\nfurrier and his apprentices. The methods and the implements used, were\r\nessentially the same as in Roman times, and in fact, up to a very recent\r\nperiod there was very little change in either.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the great industrial era at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, the guild system became ineffective, but the\r\nfurriers continued their work as heretofore. Up to about the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century, the furrier continued to be the only factor of\r\nany importance in the fur trade. There was no need for speed in his\r\nwork, for the demands of the trade were not so urgent. The fact that\r\nthe dressing of furs often occupied two to four weeks was no deterring\r\nfactor in his business. However, with the great expansion of the fur trade\r\nabout this time, it became impossible for the individual furrier to do\r\neverything himself, and keep up with the requirements of his customers.\r\nSpecialization commenced, and establishments were set up solely for fur\r\ndressing. The traditional time- and labor-consuming processes were still\r\nused, but the efficiency of work on a large scale enabled the fur dressers\r\nsuccessfully to fill their orders. But the fur trade continued to grow by\r\nleaps and bounds, and very soon the fur dressers were no longer able to\r\nmeet the demands of the trade. It was then that the science of chemistry\r\ncame to the aid of the fur dresser, and helped him meet the exigency. By\r\ndevising dressing processes which were cheap and efficient, and which only\r\nrequired several hours, or at the most one or two days, as compared with\r\nas many weeks, the chemist brought the fur dresser out of his dilemma.\r\nAnd with the adoption of mechanical time- and labor-saving devices, the\r\nfur dressing industry has made wonderful progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFUR DRESSING\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fur dresser receives the skins in one of two shapes, flat or cased,\r\ndepending on the manner in which they were removed from the animal. Flat\r\nskins, as for example, beaver, are obtained by cutting on the under side\r\nof the animal from the root of the tail to the chin, and along the inner\r\nside of the legs from the foot to the first cut. The skins are either\r\nfastened to boards or attached to wooden hoops slightly larger than the\r\nskins, so as to stretch them, and are then carefully dried, avoiding\r\ndirect sunshine or artificial heat, as it is very easy to overheat the\r\nskins and thereby ruin them. The great majority of skins, however, are\r\ncased. The pelts are cut on the under side of the tail, and along the\r\nhind legs across the body, the skin being then removed by pulling it\r\nover the head off the body like a glove, trimming carefully about the\r\nears and nose. The skin is thus obtained inside out, and is drawn over a\r\nstretching board or wire stretcher of suitable shape and dimensions, so\r\nas to allow the skin to dry without wrinkling. The pelts, after drying\r\nin a dry, airy place, are removed from the stretchers and are ready for\r\nthe market. With some furs, as foxes, the skins are turned hair-side out\r\nwhile still somewhat moist, and then put on the stretcher again till fully\r\ndried. In most cases, however, skins are sold flesh-side out. Throughout\r\nthe various dressing operations cased skins are kept intact, being turned\r\nflesh-side out or hair-side out according as the processes are directed\r\nto the respective sides. The pelts are only cut open if they have to be\r\ndyed, or after the manufacturer receives them, when they have to be worked\r\ninto manufactured garments.\r\n\r\nA distinction which is made by fur dressers and dyers, and also by the fur\r\ntrade in general, divides furs into those derived from domestic animals,\r\nparticularly the various kinds of sheep, including also the goat species,\r\nand those obtained from other animals by trapping. In fact, at one time,\r\nand to a certain extent even to-day, dressers were divided into two groups\r\nbased on this distinction, one class dealing only with furs obtained\r\nfrom the sheep family, and the other working with other kinds of furs.\r\nThis differentiation is not a simple arbitrary one, but has a rational\r\njustification. As mentioned before, the manner and habit of living of the\r\nanimal are important factors in determining the nature and constitution of\r\nits skin, both leather and hair. The structure of the body being dependent\r\nprimarily upon the nature of the food absorbed by the animal, it is only\r\nnatural that herbivorous or vegetable-eating animals such as sheep and\r\ngoats, should possess fur of a different sort from that of the carnivorous\r\nor meat-eating animals, such as the majority of fur-bearers are. It also\r\nseems clear that furs differing in their character and constitution should\r\nrequire somewhat different treatments, and accordingly the methods are\r\nmodified when furs like lambs or goats are dressed. To a great extent,\r\nhowever, the fundamental operations are similar for all furs, regardless\r\nof nature or origin, and these will be discussed briefly.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the first great purpose of fur dressing is to render the\r\nskins more or less permanently immune from the processes of decay, it\r\nis necessary to prepare the pelts so as to be most fit to receive the\r\npreserving treatment. The skins as they are delivered to the fur dresser\r\nhave, in the majority of cases, been stretched and dried to preserve\r\nthem temporarily, while in some instances, especially with the larger\r\nfurs like bears and seals, they are salted and kept moist. The flesh-side\r\nof the pelt still has considerable fleshy and fatty tissues adhering to\r\nit, and the hair is generally soiled and occasionally blood-stained. In\r\norder to get the pelts into such a condition that they can be worked\r\nand manipulated, they first have to be made soft and flexible. Very\r\ngreasy skins are scraped raw in order to remove as much as possible of\r\nthe attached fat, the operation being known as beaming or scraping. The\r\ntypical beam, shown in Fig. 3, consists of a sloping table usually made\r\nof some hard wood, and placed at an angle of about 45°. It is generally\r\nflat, although in some instances convex beams are also used, about a yard\r\nlong, 8 to 10 inches wide, and firmly supported at the upper end. The skin\r\nis placed on the beam, flesh-side up, and is scraped with a two-handled\r\nknife (Fig. 4), always in a downward direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. BEAM.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. KNIVES USED IN FUR DRESSING.]\r\n\r\nThe first step in softening the skins is to get them thoroughly moistened,\r\nand this is variously done, depending on the nature of the skin. Lambs,\r\nfor example, require the gentlest means of wetting them, while rabbits\r\ncan stand soaking in water for several days. The manner and duration\r\nof moistening must be adjusted to the character of the pelt. For the\r\nputrefactive processes which were stopped by stretching and drying the\r\nskins, continue as soon as the pelt is again moistened. The progress\r\nof decay causes the evolution of certain gases, the simplest of which\r\nis ammonia, and eventually, if permitted to proceed, brings about the\r\ncomplete disintegration of the skin tissue. It has been found that a\r\ncertain amount of gas formation is necessary to loosen up the fibres in\r\norder to get the best quality of leather after tanning. This process must\r\nbe interrupted at the proper time and not allowed to proceed too far.\r\n\r\nSkins which have been preserved fresh by salting, require only a\r\ncomparatively short time (about 2 hours) to become softened by soaking\r\nin clean, soft water. Most dried skins need a longer treatment before\r\nthey are sufficiently flexible. The addition of certain substances to the\r\nwater facilitates and accelerates the softening. In some instances salt\r\nwater is used for soaking the pelts, the preservative action of the salt\r\ntending to prevent any loosening of the hair. A solution of 1/4% borax\r\nis very effective in rendering the skins soft, and clean as well. Borax\r\nhas an exceedingly mild alkaline action, and causes a slight swelling of\r\nthe skin tissue, which then absorbs the water more readily. Being also\r\npreservative and antiseptic, borax tends to prevent decomposition of the\r\nskin tissue. Another chemical of a different nature, but equally effective\r\nis formic acid, used in the proportion of 1.5–2.5 parts per 1000 parts of\r\nwater. Formic acid also induces a swelling of the skin, the pelts being\r\nsoaked in a short time, and the antiseptic action of the acid obviates the\r\npossibility of the hair becoming loose. The water used should be fresh and\r\nclean, and the soaking must be stopped as soon as the skins have become\r\nsoft and flexible. Sometimes the skins are allowed to soak overnight in\r\nwater, while in other cases, the pelts are just moistened by dipping in\r\nwater until thoroughly wet, and then laying them in a pile for several\r\nhours, or overnight. Another method which is practised with certain types\r\nof skins is the use of wet sawdust or of sawdust moistened with salt\r\nwater. The fur skins are either embedded in the sawdust or drummed with\r\nit for several hours, or until sufficient moisture has been absorbed\r\nto render them flexible. By this means there is no danger of the skins\r\nbeing over-soaked, or of the hair being loosened. When the skins have\r\nbeen properly wetted, they are drawn with the flesh-side across the edge\r\nof a dull knife-blade, in order to help loosen the texture of the skin.\r\nThey are then put into a tramping machine and worked until completely\r\nsoftened. In the case of large or heavy skins, the moistened pelts are\r\nworked on the beam with a dull beaming knife to impart thorough softness\r\nand flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe pelts are then cleaned with particular reference to the hair. With\r\nsome furs this is accomplished simply by drumming for several hours with\r\ndry sawdust, whereby the oil and dirt are removed from the hair, and the\r\nhair is then freed from the sawdust by caging. Other skins are washed,\r\nbeing passed through a weak soap solution for a short time, the dirty\r\nspots being brushed. Occasionally an extract of soap-bark is used in\r\nplace of the soap, being even more effective. The cleansed skins are then\r\nthoroughly rinsed to remove any of the cleaning material, which would\r\naffect the gloss of the hair if allowed to remain on the skins. Then in\r\norder to eliminate as much as possible of the water in the skins, they\r\nare hydro-extracted, a centrifugal machine of the type shown in Fig. 5\r\nbeing used. The basis of its action depends on the utilization of the\r\nprinciple of centrifugal force. The machine consists essentially of a\r\nperforated metal basket generally made of copper, capable of being rotated\r\nat a high speed. Surrounding the basket is an iron framework, polished or\r\nenamelled on the inside. The wet skins are placed in the rotating basket,\r\nfur side toward the perforations, and the water which is thrown off from\r\nthe skins passes through the little holes, and is caught up on the walls\r\nof the outside frame, from where it is led off through suitable ducts.\r\nThe centrifugal device is properly equipped with balancing and regulating\r\nattachments, as well as with a brake. The power may be applied by the\r\nover-drive or the under-drive as is most desirable in the particular case.\r\nThe inner surface of the basket can also be enamelled or otherwise made\r\nresistant to the action of acids or other chemicals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. CENTRIFUGAL MACHINE.\r\n\r\n(_Fletcher Works, Inc., Philadelphia_)]\r\n\r\nWhen the skin is removed from the animal, as much as possible of the\r\nadhering fat and flesh is scraped off, but in spite of this, and in\r\nspite of subsequent beaming by the fur dresser, there is always a thin\r\nlayer of flesh and fatty material remaining and this must be removed so\r\nas to expose the corium, enabling the efficient action of the chemicals\r\nused in the tanning processes. The process of removing this undesirable\r\nlayer from the flesh-side is known as fleshing. It is a rather delicate\r\noperation, requiring considerable experience and dexterity on the part of\r\nthe worker, for it is exceedingly easy to cut into the skin and damage\r\nthe fur. A fleshing knife of the type commonly used is shown in Fig. 6.\r\nIt consists of a sharp blade fastened at a slight angle from the vertical,\r\nwith the cutting edge away from the workman, who straddles the bench, and\r\nby drawing the skins back and forth across the edge of the blade, removes\r\nall flesh and fat, leaving the corium free and clean. Large skins cannot\r\nconveniently be fleshed in this fashion. They are placed on the beam, and\r\nfleshed with a fleshing or skiving knife similar to the beaming knife, but\r\nconsisting of a slightly curved, sharp two-edged blade having handles at\r\nboth ends. Frequent attempts have been made to use suitable machines to\r\ndo this work. A type of machine which has met with considerable success\r\nis depicted in Fig. 7. It is fashioned after the models used for the\r\nfleshing of hides for leather manufacture, and has special adjustments\r\nand regulating devices which afford protection for the hair part of the\r\nfur. From time to time other fleshing machines are put on the market, yet\r\nnone of them seems to enjoy any great popularity, for fleshing is still\r\nlargely a manual operation. With some classes of pelts, fleshing presents\r\nsome difficulties, and chemical means have to be resorted to in order to\r\nloosen the flesh sufficiently to enable proper fleshing. In the case of\r\nlarge furs like bears, leopards, and the like, which while of no great\r\nimportance in the fur trade, are occasionally met by the fur dresser,\r\nthe skins after being soaked, and washed with soap-water, are partially\r\ndried; then the flesh-side is treated with technical butter or oil, which\r\nis tramped in. A mixture of salt water and bran is then applied to the\r\nskins, thereby causing a swelling action to set in, and the flesh becomes\r\nloosened, and is easily removed by fleshing on the beam. Seals receive a\r\nspecial treatment which makes them soft, and gives them greater stretch\r\nafter they are tanned. A paste made by mixing a very dilute solution of\r\ncaustic soda with an inert substance like French chalk, china clay, etc.,\r\nis applied to the corium after the skins have been fleshed, then the\r\npelts are folded up, and allowed to lie for several hours. They are then\r\nentered into a dilute solution of calcium chloride and left overnight.\r\nAfter being washed in a paddle or drum, first with fresh water, and then\r\nin water containing lactic or formic acid to remove the lime, the skins\r\nare ready for tanning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. FLESHING KNIFE ON BENCH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. FLESHING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n(_Turner Tanning Machinery Co., Peabody, Mass._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFUR DRESSING\r\n\r\nTANNING METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the pelts have gone through the preliminary operations of softening,\r\nwashing and fleshing, they are ready to receive the treatment which\r\nwill convert the easily decomposing skin into leather of more or less\r\npermanency, depending on the method used.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century, considerable study has been made both by\r\nscientific and technical people, of the problem of leather formation.\r\nNumerous theories as to the nature of the process have been evolved, but\r\neven to this day, no satisfactory explanation has been given which would\r\naccount for all the facts as they are now known, so the matter is still a\r\nsubject of considerable controversy. Procter, who is one of the leading\r\nauthorities on leather today discusses the development of the tanning\r\ntheories as follows:\r\n\r\n“The cause of the horny nature of dried skin is that the gelatinous and\r\nswollen fibres of which it is composed not merely stiffen on drying but\r\nadhere to a homogeneous mass, as is evidenced by its translucence. If\r\nin some way we can prevent the adhesion of the fibres while drying we\r\nshall have made a step in the desired direction, and this will be the\r\nmore effective the more perfectly we have split the fibre-bundles into\r\ntheir constituent fine fibrils, and removed the substance which cements\r\nthem. The separation of the fibres can be partially attained by purely\r\nmechanical means.... Knapp, to whom we owe our first intelligible theories\r\nof the tanning process, showed that by physical means the separation and\r\ndrying of the fibres could be so far effected as to produce without any\r\ntanning agent a substance with all the outward characteristics of leather,\r\nalthough on soaking it returned completely to the raw hide state. He\r\nsoaked the prepared pelt in absolute alcohol, which penetrated between,\r\nand separated the fibres and at the same time dried them by its strong\r\naffinity for water. More recently, Meunier has obtained a similar result\r\nby the use of a concentrated solution of potassium carbonate which is even\r\nmore strongly dehydrating.\r\n\r\n“Knapp made a further step by adding to his alcohol a small quantity\r\nof stearic acid which, as the alcohol evaporated, left a thin fatty\r\ncovering on the fibres which completely prevented their adhesion, and\r\nreduced their tendency to absorb water; and he so produced a very soft and\r\nwhite leather. Somewhat similar are the principles of the many primitive\r\nmethods which apply fatty and albuminous matters, grease, butter, milk, or\r\nbrains to the wet skin, and by mechanical kneading and stretching, aided\r\nby capillarity, work these matters in between the fibres as the water\r\nevaporates. Such methods are still used, and enter into many processes in\r\nwhich other tanning agents are also employed.\r\n\r\n“Building upon these facts, Prof. Knapp advanced the theory that the\r\neffect of all tanning processes was not to cause a change in the fibres\r\nthemselves, chemical or otherwise, but merely to isolate and coat them\r\nwith water-resisting materials which prevented their subsequent swelling\r\nand adhesion. True as this theory undoubtedly is in many cases, it can\r\nhardly be accepted as the whole truth, and it seems incontestable that\r\nfrequently the fibres themselves undergo actual chemical changes which\r\nrender them insoluble and nonadhesive.\r\n\r\n“Before Knapp’s work, the prevalent theory, at least as regards vegetable\r\ntannage, had been a chemical one, started by Sir Humphrey Davy. If a\r\nsolution of gelatine be mixed in proper proportion with one of tannin,\r\nboth unite to form a voluminous curdy precipitate; and, according to\r\nDavy’s ideas, this was amorphous leather. Against this, it was urged\r\nthat even the supposed ‘tannate of gelatine’ itself could not be a\r\ntrue chemical compound, since the proportions of its constituents were\r\nconsiderably varied by changes in the strength of the solutions, or by\r\nwashing the precipitate with hot water; and further, that in chemical\r\ncompounds, the form was changed, and no trace of the original constituents\r\nappeared in the compound; while in leather apart from some change of color\r\nand properties, the original fibrous structure remained unaltered.\r\n\r\n“This reasoning appears much less conclusive now than it did in Knapp’s\r\nday. Against the last objection guncotton may be quoted as an instance\r\nof profound chemical change with no alteration in outside appearance;\r\nand it is recognized that, especially among complex organic substances,\r\nchemical reactions are rarely complete, but that stable positions are\r\nreached, so-called ‘equilibria,’ in which the proportion of changed and\r\nunchanged substance is dependent on concentration or other conditions;\r\nand that therefore such a precipitate might well be a mixture of gelatine\r\nwith a true gelatine tannate from which further portions of tannin might\r\nbe dissociated by water.\r\n\r\n“With the clearing up of old difficulties, however, the conflict between\r\nchemical and physical theories has, as is usually the case, merely\r\npassed into a new phase. Years ago, it was shown by Linder and Picton and\r\nothers, that liquids could be obtained which were not really solutions\r\nof ions or molecules, but merely suspensions like that of clay in water,\r\nor butter-fat in milk; but so finely divided as to appear clear and\r\ntransparent, and pass through filters like true solutions. Later, by\r\nmeans of the ultra-microscope their discrete particles have actually\r\nbeen made visible, each of them consisting of many molecules of the\r\nsuspended substance. Nevertheless, these particles have many molecular\r\nproperties, possessing plus or minus electrical charges; behaving like\r\nlarge ions under the influence of an electrical current; and mutually\r\nprecipitating and neutralizing each other when positive and negative\r\nare brought together. Such solutions are called ‘colloid,’ and those of\r\ngelatine and tannin are of the class, so that it is now often said that\r\nthe precipitation of gelatine by tannin, and the fixation of tannin by\r\ngelatinous fibre are merely ‘colloidal’ and ‘physical,’ and not ‘chemical’\r\nphenomena. Admitting the facts, the question still arises whether the\r\ndistinction between chemical and physical is not here one without a\r\ndifference; and whether between the purely ionized dilute solution of a\r\nsalt and the coarsely granular clay suspension there is any point where a\r\ndefinite line of demarcation can be drawn. The writer inclines to the view\r\nthat there is not; and that ionic and colloidal combinations are extreme\r\ncases of the same laws, both physical, and both chemical.”\r\n\r\nThere are several methods which are used in tanning furs, each having\r\nits peculiar characteristics and qualities, and possessing individual\r\nadvantages and disadvantages. In order to be able to judge the merits of\r\nthe various processes, it is necessary to have a criterion which can serve\r\nas a basis of reference. Fahrion, a recognized authority and investigator\r\nin this field, gives a definition of leather which is usually accepted\r\nas a standard for comparison. He says: “Leather is animal skin, which on\r\nsoaking in water and subsequent drying does not become hard and tinny, but\r\nremains soft and flexible; which does not decay in the presence of cold\r\nwater; and which does not yield any gelatine on boiling with water.” While\r\nthe requirements set forth in this statement are essential for leather,\r\nand a compliance with them would also be desirable for tanned furs, a\r\nsomewhat less rigorous standard of conditions to fulfil is satisfactory\r\nfor the general needs and purposes of furs. The chief qualities which\r\ntanned furs must possess, with particular reference to the leather side of\r\nthe pelt, are retention of softness and flexibility after being moistened\r\nby the furrier for manufacturing purposes, and subsequent drying; and\r\nfreedom from a tendency to decay during this operation and thereafter. If\r\nthe furs are to be dyed, the effect of the dyeing must also be considered,\r\nand the tanning must be such as to enable the dyed furs to possess the\r\nabove qualities.\r\n\r\nThe most important tanning processes employed for furs are the following:\r\n\r\n  1.

SALT-ACID TAN, OR PICKLE\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most extensively used methods for tanning furs, and is\r\nalso very cheap and easily applied. A typical formula for this tan is the\r\nfollowing: A solution of salt is prepared containing about 10% of common\r\nsalt, sodium chloride, and to this is added 1/2–3/4 ounce of sulphuric\r\nacid for each gallon of tanning liquor. The proportions may be varied\r\nwithin certain limits, but the figures here given are those which have\r\nproven successful in practise. The solution should be made in a wooden\r\nor earthenware container, free from any metal, as it would be attacked\r\nby the acid. The liquor is then applied to the flesh-side of the fleshed\r\nskins by means of a brush, making sure to touch all parts of the pelt.\r\nThey are then placed in a pile and allowed to remain thus until tanned, an\r\noperation which occupies a time ranging from a few hours to two or three\r\ndays depending on the thickness of the skins. When the corium has lost its\r\ntranslucence and has become of a milky-white color throughout the entire\r\nthickness of the skin, as can be seen by viewing a cross-section, the skin\r\nmay be considered tanned. In some instances, where the hair of the fur can\r\nstand immersion without injury, the skins are entered into the pickling\r\nsolution and allowed to remain for 12 to 24 hours, which is generally a\r\nsufficient time to tan them in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe acid of the pickle causes the skin to swell, the salt then penetrating\r\nbetween the fibres of the corium, and at the same time reducing the\r\nswelling of the skin. The acid also neutralizes the alkaline products\r\nof decomposition which may form, while the salt acts as a deterrent to\r\nthe progress of the putrefactive processes. When the skin is dried after\r\ntanning, and stretched and finished, a soft white leather is obtained\r\nwhich is permanent as long as it is kept dry. It is the salt which causes\r\nthe fibres of the skin to be completely differentiated and thus prevents\r\ntheir adhesion.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that other acids besides sulphuric can be\r\nused for the pickle, organic as well as mineral, formic acid in 1/4%\r\nsolution being especially effective and giving excellent results, but\r\nis more expensive than the mineral acid. A method, which in principle\r\nis identical with the pickle, but carried out in an entirely different\r\nmanner, is the lactic acid fermentation process, or “Schrot-beize” as it\r\nis called in German. The procedure is in general as follows: “The fleshed\r\nskins are placed on tables, flesh-side up, and covered with a layer of\r\nbruised barley grains, or a mixture of 3 parts of wheat bran and 2 parts\r\nof rye flour. Then the head, tail and legs are turned inward, and the\r\nskins rolled up in little cushions, hair-side out, and placed in a vat.\r\nWhen this is filled with the skins a solution of common salt is poured\r\nover them, and they are allowed to remain thus in a moderately cool place\r\nfor 24 hours. After this time, the skins are carefully unrolled, so as\r\nnot to remove any of the adhering solid materials, and turning the skins\r\nhair-side inward, they are laid flat together in pairs and placed in an\r\nempty vat. After another 24 hours they are again unpacked and replaced in\r\nanother vat, care being taken each time to keep all the solid particles\r\nadhering to the flesh-side. This operation is continued and repeated until\r\nthe skins are properly tanned, which takes from 10 to 14 days, depending\r\non the weather and the temperature. The skins are then removed, rinsed\r\nfree of the tanning substances, pressed, dried and finished.” A somewhat\r\nmodified form of this process is the so-called Russian tan, which is\r\nusually done in the following manner: 5 parts of bruised barley grains\r\nare mixed with ten parts of luke-warm water in a vat, which is then\r\ncovered up. A small quantity of brewers’ yeast is also added to aid in the\r\nfermentation. As soon as the mixture develops a slight heat, one part of\r\nfresh whey is added, and the fleshed skins entered into the tanning liquor\r\nin which they remain for about 12 hours. They are then tramped in the\r\nmixture so as to effect greater penetration, and left until the tanning\r\nprocess is complete. Whey is the milk fluid left after the casein and most\r\nof the fat have been removed from the milk by coagulation, and consists\r\npractically of a solution of all the milk-sugar or lactose, and the lactic\r\nacid of the milk, together with a small percentage of mineral salts, and\r\na slight amount of fat. By fermentation, the milk-sugar is converted into\r\nlactic acid, which helps to effect the tan by swelling the skin.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the fermentation processes depends to a considerable\r\ndegree on the action of certain bacteria and yeasts. Bacteria are\r\none-celled organisms belonging to the vegetable kingdom, and some are so\r\nsmall as to be scarcely visible under a microscope, while some indeed\r\ncannot be seen by any means, their existence being inferred from their\r\neffects. As they vary in size, bacteria also vary in shape, some being\r\nspherical, others in the form of long, thin rods, while still others are\r\nof a spiral shape; another common form is the dumb-bell shaped bacterium.\r\nSome types are provided with what are known as flagella, which resemble\r\nfine hairs attached to the body of the organism, and which enable it to\r\nmove about actively in liquids. The food of bacteria is always in liquid\r\nform, as only in this condition can it be absorbed. However, some kinds of\r\nbacteria attack solid substances from which they obtain their nourishment,\r\nbut this is done in an indirect way, by secreting certain fluids known as\r\nenzymes, which dissolve or digest the material and convert it into a form\r\nthat can easily be absorbed by the bacteria. The enzymes are non-living\r\nchemical substances, which possess the peculiar property of bringing\r\nabout the chemical change of an almost indefinite amount of material\r\nupon which they act, without themselves being in any way changed. Yeasts\r\nalso act in a manner similar to the bacteria in causing various chemical\r\nchanges, particularly inducing fementations. In the simple “Schrot-beize,”\r\nthe starch contained in the bran or barley grains is first converted to\r\na soluble sugar by means of enzymes secreted by the bacteria which are\r\nalways present. This sugar then undergoes an acid fermentation, with\r\nthe formation of lactic and acetic acids, due in this case to organisms\r\nknown as the _bacterium furfuris A_ and _B_. The action of the Russian\r\ntan is similar, but quicker. In this case, the sugar is already present\r\nin soluble form, and the yeast cells cause its fermentation with the\r\nproduction of lactic acid. In both cases, the acids as they form swell\r\nand loosen up the skin fibres slowly, the salt penetrating between them,\r\nand keeping them separated on drying. Both methods give results which\r\nare equally good, but by the Russian tan the skins acquire a disagreeable\r\nodor, which makes this method of dressing objectionable.\r\n\r\nThe lactic acid fermentation processes have an advantage over the pickle,\r\nin that the slow formation of weak organic acids with their gradual action\r\nproduce a softer leather, with a gentler ‘feel,’ the presence of the flour\r\nand the grains of the tan, aside from their tanning action, contributing\r\nto the fullness and softness of the leather. There is also less likelihood\r\nof the leather being subsequently affected by the presence of the acid\r\nin it, as lactic and acetic acids are much less injurious than sulphuric\r\nacid to leather. These disadvantages of the pickle can to a large degree,\r\nbe overcome without any great difficulty. On the other hand, the matter\r\nof the length of time of the tanning process, shows the acid pickle at\r\na great advantage, and so, especially for furs other than those obtained\r\nfrom sheep and goats, the pickle is in most cases used as the principle\r\nmethod of tanning. In Austria, Russia, and to a certain extent in Germany\r\nalso, the “Schrot-beize” is still considerably employed, chiefly for\r\ndressing sheep and lamb skins. The dressing of the various kinds of\r\nPersian lambs, caraculs, astrachans, etc., in the native center of the\r\nindustry in Buchara and surrounding districts, is also a “Schrot-beize,”\r\nbarley, rice flour or rye flour, and salt water being used to prepare the\r\nskins, the manipulations being essentially the same as those described\r\nabove, although carried out in cruder and more primitive fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. MINERAL TANS\r\n\r\nThe basis of the tanning of furs by means of solutions of mineral\r\ncompounds is the fact that the basic salts of certain metals are capable\r\nof producing leather. It has been found that compounds of aluminum such as\r\nalum or aluminum sulphate, or any other soluble neutral salt of aluminum,\r\npossess tanning powers. Other metals which are capable of forming salts\r\nof the same type are also endowed with the quality of converting skin\r\nto leather under suitable conditions, chromium and iron being the most\r\nimportant metals in this connection. Chemically these metals all belong\r\nto the same group, and have properties which are very similar in many\r\nrespects, the characteristic of most importance for tanning purposes\r\nbeing the quality of forming soluble basic salts by the addition of\r\nalkalies or alkaline carbonates to solutions of their neutral salts, or\r\nin certain instances simply by the action of water upon these neutral\r\nsalts. By neutral salts are meant those in which the metallic content is\r\ncombined with the normal proportion of acid; while basic salts are those\r\nin which the acidic portion is present in less than the normal ratio,\r\nbeing partially replaced by a hydroxide group. When the acid part of\r\nthe salt has been entirely replaced in this way, the compound is called\r\na hydroxide or hydrate of the metal. Between the neutral salt and the\r\nhydroxide several different basic salts are possible, some being soluble,\r\nwhile others are insoluble. If into a solution containing a basic salt of\r\neither aluminum, iron or chromium a skin be entered, a part of the basic\r\nsalt will be precipitated on it in insoluble form. Inasmuch as neutral\r\nsalts of these metals when dissolved in water split up to a small degree,\r\ninto free acid and soluble basic salt, a skin immersed in such a solution\r\nwill also absorb the basic salt in an insoluble form. Upon these facts in\r\ngeneral, depends the action of the mineral tans used in tanning furs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _Alum Tan_\r\n\r\nThe alum tan is one of the oldest methods of producing leather, being\r\nemployed by the Romans about two thousand years ago, and it is believed,\r\nby the Egyptians at a much earlier period. Its extensive use in Europe,\r\nhowever, dates from the time of the conquest of Spain by the Moors, who\r\nintroduced the process.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, rabbits and moles are tanned by this process, as are\r\nalso at times other furs such as muskrats, squirrels, sables, martens,\r\netc., when a better tan is desired than that produced by the pickle.\r\nOrdinary alum, which is a double sulphate of aluminum and potassium, and\r\naluminum sulphate are the chief compounds used for this tan. In recent\r\nyears, the aluminum sulphate has to a considerable degree replaced the\r\nalum for tanning, inasmuch as it can be cheaply obtained in a sufficiently\r\npure form, and contains about one and one-half times as much active\r\naluminum compound as does alum.\r\n\r\nWhile the aluminum salt can be used alone for tanning, it produces a\r\nstiff, imperfect leather, so salt is always added. The ratio of the salt\r\nto the aluminum sulphate or alum can vary within rather wide limits, the\r\nmixtures used in practise ranging from one part of salt to four parts\r\nof the aluminum compound, up to equal parts of both, or even in some\r\nformulas, a greater proportion of salt than of the other constituent.\r\nRatios which are most common are four of alum to three of salt, or two of\r\nalum to one of salt.\r\n\r\nWhen aluminum sulphate is dissolved in water, a small part of it splits\r\nup into a soluble basic salt and an equivalent amount of free acid. The\r\nreaction may be shown as follows:\r\n\r\n  Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 2H₂O = Al₂(SO₄)₂(OH)₂ + H₂SO₄\r\n  aluminum    water  basic aluminum  sulphuric\r\n  sulphate              sulphate       acid\r\n\r\nWhen a skin is entered into such a solution, the free acid is absorbed,\r\ncausing a swelling of the pelt. While this is taking place, a further\r\nquantity of the neutral aluminum salt splits up into more basic salt and\r\nfree acid. At the same time the basic aluminum sulphate is also taken\r\nup by the skin, probably attaching itself to some of the acidic groups\r\ncontained in the skin substance, in a manner analogous to the combination\r\nof the acid with the basic groups of the skin substance. A point is\r\nreached, however, when the skin is no longer able to take up more of the\r\nbasic salt, for the presence of the acid undoubtedly acts as a deterrent.\r\nThe skin, if dried after such a treatment contains a small amount of\r\naluminum, which is insufficient to tan the pelt properly, and as a result\r\nthis comes out in an undesirable and quite useless condition. If to the\r\nsolution of the aluminum sulphate salt is added, a different result is\r\nobtained. To a certain extent the salt acts here as in the pickle. The\r\nskin on absorbing the free acid of the solution naturally swells, but the\r\nsalt reduces this swelling, and at the same time, by penetrating between\r\nthe fibres and dehydrating them, produces a leather as in the pickle.\r\nIn addition, the presence of the salt enables a greater amount of basic\r\naluminum sulphate to be formed, and thus a greater quantity is taken up\r\nby the skin. On drying and stretching after such a treatment, a soft,\r\nflexible and stretchable leather is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe number of formulas for tanning furs by this process is legion, the\r\nprinciple being the same in every instance, and mixtures of salt and alum\r\nor aluminum sulphate form the basis of the various tans. Following are a\r\nfew typical formulas, which have been found to be of practical value:\r\n\r\nA solution is prepared by dissolving 7.5 lbs. of alum and 3 lbs. of\r\ncommon salt in 20 gallons of water. When cool, the clean, fleshed skins\r\nare entered, being paddled or drummed for a short time and then allowed\r\nto remain until tanned. By this method the hair also takes up some of the\r\nalum, and if the skins are to be dyed, unevenness may result. In order to\r\navoid this, the tanning may be effected by brushing a stronger solution\r\non the pelt. A mixture of 4 lbs. of alum and 3 lbs. of salt, dissolved\r\nin 8 gallons of water, and made into a paste by the addition of 4 lbs. of\r\nflour, is applied to the flesh-side of the skins. These are then placed in\r\npairs, flesh-side together, and allowed to remain in a pile until tanned.\r\nSometimes a second application is given. The flour may be omitted, but it\r\nserves to cause the tanning mixture to adhere better to the skins.\r\n\r\nStill another method is the following: Into the flesh of the moist,\r\nfleshed skins is rubbed a mixture of two parts of dry powdered alum with\r\none part of salt. After allowing time for it to be absorbed, another\r\napplication is given, rubbing in well, and especially treating the thick\r\nparts. The pelts are then folded up, or rolled together, flesh-side in,\r\nand placed in a vat or tub, which is covered up to prevent drying. They\r\nare left so until tanned, as shown by examination and test. They are then\r\nrinsed, hydro-extracted and dried, and after stretching and finishing, a\r\nsoft, white, pliable leather is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _Chrome Tan_\r\n\r\nBy using chrome alum instead of ordinary alum, together with salt, skins\r\ncan be tanned, but the leather formed is not altogether satisfactory.\r\nThe basic principle here is the same as in the alum tan, depending on the\r\nformation of soluble basic chrome sulphates in the solution of a neutral\r\nsulphate. The method employed at the present time, the so-called one-bath\r\nprocess as distinct from the two-bath process, which cannot be applied\r\nfor tanning furs, involves the production of the basic chrome sulphate by\r\nthe addition of an alkali or an alkaline carbonate to the solution of the\r\nneutral salt. It was Prof. Knapp who first published this process as early\r\nas 1858; but it was not until 1893 that it was shown to be of practical\r\nvalue, and was then patented in this country by Martin Dennis. Since that\r\ntime it has been in general use with but slight modifications.\r\n\r\nThe chrome tan is used only to a limited extent in the tanning of furs,\r\nthe method requiring very careful treatment and accurate supervision\r\nduring the various stages of the process, and the leather coming out\r\ncolored a pale-blue-green tint, which for some purposes is objectionable.\r\nIn some plants ponies and rabbits are tanned with chrome; and when the\r\nskins are to be dyed by means of certain coal tar dyes, they have to\r\nreceive a chrome tannage. The leather produced by a chrome tan is very\r\ndurable, and possesses great resistance to the action of water.\r\n\r\nAny salt of chromium, with either mineral or organic acids, can be used,\r\nbut chrome alum is the one most commonly employed. If a skin is entered\r\ndirectly into a solution of a chrome salt made basic with an alkali, the\r\nprecipitation of the insoluble basic salt will take place very rapidly,\r\nand the tanning will be only superficial. The procedure is therefore\r\nfirst to treat the skins with a chrome solution which forms only small\r\nquantities of the basic salt. After the skins are impregnated with the\r\nsolution, this is made basic, so that the real tan will take place within\r\nthe skin tissues among the fibres of the corium. A common formula is the\r\nfollowing: 5 lbs. of chrome alum are dissolved in 10 gallons of water.\r\nThe skins are entered into the solution at about 70° F. and paddled for\r\nabout 2 hours, or drummed for one hour. Then a solution of three pounds\r\nof washing soda is added slowly to the liquor which is then stirred up\r\nwell, and the skins drummed or paddled again for an hour or two, and then\r\nleft in the liquor for 12 to 24 hours till completely tanned. The skins\r\nare rinsed, and washed in 1/2% solution containing 2/3% of the weight\r\nof the skins of borax. The pelts are then well washed in clean water,\r\nhydro-extracted and dried.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _Iron Tan_\r\n\r\nTanning by means of iron salts has thus far been merely a matter of\r\nscientific interest and has not found any practical use. The principle\r\ninvolved is identical with that of the preceding mineral processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CHAMOIS TAN\r\n\r\nThe chamois dressing, as previously noted, is undoubtedly the oldest\r\nmethod of preparing leather from skin, the various fat-containing\r\nsubstances derived from animals, fish, birds, etc., being used for the\r\npurpose. The chief object of the fat was to coat the fibres of the skin,\r\nthus preventing their adhesion, and at the same time rendering them\r\nresistant to water. In the true chamois tan, the fat seems to have also\r\na chemical function in contradistinction to the other which is merely\r\nphysical or mechanical. For, if skins tanned by the chamois process\r\nbe treated with a weak solution of an alkali, all the fatty materials\r\nshould be removed thereby, but this happens only to a small extent, the\r\npelt retaining its softness and pliability, and the other characteristic\r\nqualities of leather, indicating that the fat is combined intimately with\r\nthe skin substance in a permanent fashion.\r\n\r\nIn tanning furs, various oils and fats are used, but not all are capable\r\nof producing a chamois tan. Among the fatty materials are mineral oils,\r\nand vegetable and animal oils and fats. Mineral oils are the distillation\r\nproducts of petroleum, partially liquid, and partially solid. Being\r\ninert substances, they have no tanning effect, but serve merely as\r\nwater-proofing or fattening materials. Except for their oily nature they\r\nhave nothing in common with fats, being quite unaffected by solutions of\r\nalkalies or of acids.\r\n\r\nVegetable and animal fats and oils are, when pure, neutral substances\r\nformed by the combination of fatty acids with glycerine. They possess\r\nthe property of saponification, that is, of forming a soap when treated\r\nwith an alkali, the soap being the alkaline salt of the fatty acid.\r\nUnder certain conditions, the fat can be split up into free fatty acid\r\nand glycerine by the action of acids, or even water alone. Some fats\r\non long standing, split up in this way spontaneously in the presence of\r\nmoist air. As a general rule, those fats which exhibit this property to a\r\nmarked degree are affected by contact with the air, due to the absorption\r\nof oxygen which reacts chemically with the fats, forming what are known\r\nas oxy-fatty acids, usually less soluble, and having a higher melting\r\npoint than the original fats. Vegetable and animal fatty materials are\r\nclassified on the basis of this phenomenon of absorbing oxygen from the\r\nair, those possessing this quality to a great degree being called “drying\r\noils,” others being “partially drying,” or “non-drying.” Olive oil,\r\ncastor oil, cocoanut oil and cottonseed oil are examples of non-drying\r\nor partially-drying vegetable oils, linseed oil being the most important\r\ndrying-oil in this class. Tallow, lard, butter-fat, neats-foot oil are\r\nnon-drying animal fats, the drying oils being seal oil, whale oil, and\r\ncod-liver oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. TRAMPING MACHINE OR “KICKER.”\r\n\r\n(_F. Blattner, Brooklyn, New York._)]\r\n\r\nFor tanning purposes, this property of absorbing oxygen is important,\r\nbecause only with drying oils can a true chamois tan be obtained,\r\nnon-drying oils acting like mineral oils only as water-proofing materials.\r\nThe details of the chamois process are not quite clear, there being\r\nconsiderable difference of opinion on the matter. But all the studies\r\non the subject tend to prove that there are at least two phases to the\r\nprocess: first, the mechanical covering of the fibres with the fat, this\r\nproperty being common to all fats or oils which may be used; and second,\r\nthe combination of the fat with the skin in some chemical way, as a result\r\nof the oxidation of the fat, a characteristic found only in the drying\r\noils. During the oxidation of the fats, the glycerine in them is converted\r\nto acrolein or acryl-aldehyde, which also aids the tanning. It was at one\r\ntime supposed that the tanning action was due to this aldehyde alone,\r\nbut a chamois tan can be made with fatty substances from which all the\r\nglycerine has been removed. The evidence on this question, however, is\r\nnot quite conclusive.\r\n\r\nIn general, the procedure of the chamois tan is as follows: The\r\nhydro-extracted, fleshed skins are rubbed on the flesh-side with a good\r\nquality of seal-oil. They are then folded up, and put into a ‘kicker,’\r\nwhere they are tramped for two or three hours to work in the oil. The\r\nkicker is a machine such as shown in Fig. 8 consisting of a receptacle for\r\nthe skins, and two wooden hammers which work up and down mechanically,\r\nturning and pounding the skins. (As many as 1000–1500 skins of the size\r\nof musk-rats can be worked at one time in such a machine.) The pelts are\r\nthen taken out and hung up in a warm room for several hours, considerable\r\noxidation taking place. Another coat of oil is then applied, which is\r\nagain tramped in, and the skins are hung up once more and exposed to the\r\nair to cause the oil to oxidize. After the skins are sufficiently tanned\r\nthey are rinsed in a weak soda solution to remove the excess oil, washed\r\nand dried. When skins with fine hair such as marten, sable, mink, etc.,\r\nreceive a chamois tan, they are not tramped in kickers as the delicate\r\ntop-hair will be broken, and the value of the skin thereby reduced.\r\nInstead they are placed in small drums, together with metal balls of\r\nvarying sizes and weights depending on the particular fur treated, and the\r\noil is worked in by rotating the drum. Such a ball-drum, as it is called,\r\nis shown in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. BALL DRUM.\r\n\r\n(_F. Blattner, Brooklyn, New York._)]\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the chamois tan may be discussed the process of\r\noiling, inasmuch as the method of application and the effect are both\r\nsimilar to the chamois tan up to a certain point. It is customary to\r\ntreat skins tanned by any other method but the chamois process, with\r\nsome oil in order to render them more impervious to water. The greatest\r\nvariety of oils and fats can be used, the action in most cases being\r\nsimply the mechanical isolation of the skin fibres by such a substance,\r\nthus corresponding to the first or physical phase of the chamois tan.\r\nThe chemical phase, if it takes place at all, is usually slight, and\r\nis merely incidental. Oiling is generally applied either before drying\r\nafter tanning, or after drying, the oiled skins being placed in a kicker\r\nand tramped to cause the oil to penetrate. In some instances the oiling\r\nmaterial is put in the same mixture as the tanning chemicals, and the\r\ntanning and oiling are effected simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAmong fatty substances used for oiling are mineral oils, such as paraffine\r\noil, and vaseline; animal fats, like train oils, butter, egg-yolk,\r\nglycerine, neats-foot oil; vegetable oils, like olive oil, castor oil,\r\ncottonseed oil; also sulphonated castor oil and sulphonated neats-foot\r\noil. These may be used singly or in various mixtures, an emulsion of an\r\noil and a soft soap also being frequently employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. FORMALDEHYDE TANS\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde has proven to be of great value in the tanning of furs,\r\nusually in conjunction with other processes. Formaldehyde is a gas with\r\na strong, irritating odor, and its 40% solution, which is the customary\r\ncommercial form, also possesses this quality. When skins are treated for\r\nseveral hours with a very dilute solution of the commercial product, a\r\nleather is obtained which combines the properties of the alum tan and\r\nthe chamois tan. Moreover, in the majority of observed cases, where furs\r\nhave been tanned with formaldehyde, the skins seem to acquire a certain\r\nimmunity to the attacks of vermin and moths. Although the skins do\r\nnot in any way retain the odor of the formaldehyde, nevertheless these\r\ndestructive agents seem to be repelled.\r\n\r\nNumerous processes have been devised which use formaldehyde in connection\r\nwith other substances for tanning. Thus in a German patent is described\r\na method involving the alternate or simultaneous treatment of pelts\r\nwith solutions of formaldehyde and alpha or beta naphthol. Both the\r\nformaldehyde and the naphthol exercise tanning actions, but the process\r\nis not used in practise.\r\n\r\nIn 1911, Stiasny, a well-known leather chemist produced a synthetic\r\nsubstance by the condensation of formaldehyde with a sulphonated phenol,\r\nforming an artificial tannin. This chemical, called “Neradol D,” exhibits\r\nmany of the properties characteristic of true tannins, although in no way\r\nrelated by structure and composition. By the use of “Neradol D” a soft,\r\nwhite and flexible leather is obtained, and it is therefore a suitable\r\ntanning material for furs.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. COMBINATION TANS\r\n\r\nIn many instances more than one method is employed in tanning the furs,\r\nand in this way what is known as a combination tan is produced. While the\r\nvarious individual processes described give more or less satisfactory\r\nresults by themselves, they generally possess some features, which\r\nfor certain purposes may be undesirable, and which can be eliminated\r\nor considerably reduced by using other processes at the same time or\r\nsubsequently. Some of the combination methods are, pickle with chrome\r\ntan, alum tan with chrome tan, and formaldehyde tan with pickle, mineral\r\ntan or chamois tan. By means of such combinations various qualities of\r\ntanned furs can be obtained, and if it is desired to produce a pelt having\r\ncertain special characteristics, this can be brought about by combining\r\ntwo or more standard methods.\r\n\r\nSome illustrations of combined tannages are the following: Alum-chrome\r\ntan. The skins are tanned by the regular alum process, then the\r\nconstituents of the chrome tan are dissolved directly in the same bath,\r\nand the chrome tan is effected as usual. Chrome-formaldehyde tan. To the\r\nregular chrome tan solution is added 1/2 lb. of formaldehyde for every 10\r\ngallons of chrome liquor. The rest of the process is as ordinarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. VEGETABLE TANS\r\n\r\nIn practise, the vegetable tanning matters are not used for furs, although\r\nin some special instances gambier cutch may be employed occasionally\r\nwith some other tan. However, many of these tannins also have dyeing\r\nproperties, and are used in dyeing the furs. In this connection it must\r\nbe mentioned that furs dyed with these materials also receive a vegetable\r\ntan, which improves the quality of the leather to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of The Various Tanning Methods\r\n\r\nIn choosing a method for tanning any particular kind of fur, several\r\nfactors must be considered. The nature of the pelt, insofar as it is weak\r\nor strong; the time, labor and cost of materials required by the tanning\r\nprocess; the effect on the leather of the different dyes and chemicals\r\nused in dyeing, if the skin is to be dyed, are a few of the points\r\nrequiring attention and consideration.\r\n\r\nFor furs which are only to be dressed, a simple tan like the pickle will\r\nsuffice in most cases. Special instances, such as the rabbit and mole\r\nalready mentioned, and a few other furs are tanned by the alum method. The\r\npickle is undoubtedly the cheapest and simplest method of tanning skins,\r\nand yields a soft, white leather which is permanent as long as it is kept\r\ndry. If it is put into water, about 25% of the salt contained within\r\nthe pelt dissolves out, and the acid present swells up the tissues. If\r\nthe skin is dried in this condition, it will come out hard and brittle,\r\ntending to crack very easily. By treating the leather before drying with a\r\nstrong salt solution, a good deal of the extracted salt will be replaced,\r\nand on drying and stretching, it will work out soft. Skins tanned by\r\nthe “Schrot-beize” are affected by water in quite the same manner as the\r\npickled skins.\r\n\r\nThe alum tan gives a leather similar to that produced by the pickle, but\r\nwith the advantage that the skins possess greater stretch and flexibility.\r\nIn its resistance to water, the alum-tanned pelt is quite as susceptible\r\nas the other. As a general rule, the skin absorbs about 6% of its weight\r\nof alum from the tanning solution, but gives up three-quarters of this\r\nwhen it is soaked in water, producing on drying, a hard, stiff leather.\r\nThe chrome tan is especially impervious to water, easily resisting\r\ntemperatures of 80° C., and even boiling water. It is employed to only\r\na limited extent on account of the special effort and care required\r\nto obtain satisfactory results, also because the pelt acquires a pale\r\nblue-green color which is not desired on dressed skins. The chamois\r\ntan, and some of the combinations of the formaldehyde tan with the other\r\nmethods, give very soft, flexible leathers which possess a sufficiently\r\ngreat resistance to the effects of water and heat.\r\n\r\nIn tests made to determine the best working temperatures for dyeing\r\nskins dressed by the salt-acid tan, and for skins dressed by the chamois\r\nprocess, some very interesting facts were brought out. These two tans\r\nwere chosen because they represent opposite extremes, the salt-acid tan\r\nusually giving the poorest results, and the chamois tan giving the best\r\nresults in practise in dyeing. Other methods, except the chrome, range\r\nbetween these two. The procedure in these experiments was to treat the\r\nskins at ordinary temperatures in water, or dilute solutions of the\r\nvarious chemicals and dyes usually employed in dyeing, and then heat these\r\nsolutions until the leather just began to shrink and shrivel up. This\r\npoint, called the shrinking point (S.P.), gave the temperature to which\r\nthe skins could be subjected in the given solution without danger to the\r\npelt. (The experiments and observations were made by Erich Schlottauer,\r\nwhile director of a large German fur dressing and dyeing plant).\r\n\r\nThe first observation made was that different furs tanned by the same\r\nprocess were affected differently in the same solutions. Thus in plain\r\nwater, three furs, all tanned by the acid-salt tan, had shrinking points\r\nvarying by several degrees; similarly with two different furs tanned by\r\nthe chamois process, there was a variation in the shrinking point of two\r\ndegrees. The explanation of this discrepancy among the different skins may\r\nbe that there was a slight difference in the conditions under which they\r\nwere tanned, experiments showing that a maximum difference of 4° C. may\r\nexist among skins tanned by the same process, but not under the same or\r\nidentical circumstances. Another reason for the variation may be the fact,\r\nthat some skins are more greasy than others, and are thus more resistant\r\nto the effects of water or of some chemicals. The furs with the higher\r\nshrinking points in water were those which naturally are more greasy than\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nWeak solutions of acids tend slightly to lower the shrinking point, while\r\nweak solutions of alkalies appreciably raise it, in both chamois-tanned\r\nand salt-acid-tanned skins. Solutions of dyes and mordants as a general\r\nrule increase the resistance of the skin to heat, varying quantities of\r\nthese substances having no, or little different effects on the shrinking\r\npoints. Previous treatment of the leather with some oil considerably\r\nraises the shrinking point of the pelt. Formaldehyde effects a great\r\nincrease of the resistance of the skins to heat, especially with\r\nchamois-tanned furs. The experiments in this case were made by first\r\ntreating the skins in the weak formaldehyde solution, and then determining\r\nthe shrinking point in plain water.\r\n\r\nTwo skins, both dressed by the “Schrot-beize,” a Persian lamb and an\r\nastrachan, after dyeing had shrinking points almost 10 degrees higher than\r\nwhen undyed. The extra tannage which the skins received from the tannins\r\nused in the dye mixtures for these furs, accounts for this increased\r\nresistance to heat.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give the observed figures in the different\r\nexperiments:\r\n\r\n                  TABLE I\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                   |  A   |  B   |  C   |\r\n  |                   | S.P. | S.P. | S.P. |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+\r\n  |_Salt-acid Tan_    |  C.  |  C.  |  C.  |\r\n  |Australian Opossum |  46° |  58° |  45° |\r\n  |Marmot             |  45° |  50° |  42° |\r\n  |Skunk              |  47° |  56° |  43° |\r\n  |                   |      |      |      |\r\n  |_Chamois Tan_      |      |      |      |\r\n  |Mink               |  52° |  61° |  45° |\r\n  |Muskrat            |  50° |  58° |  42° |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+\r\n    A--Water\r\n    B--Water plus 1% Ammonia (s.g. 0.910)\r\n    C--Water plus 1% Sulphuric acid (66°\r\n        Beaumé)\r\n\r\n                  TABLE II\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                   |  A   |  B   |  C   |\r\n  |                   | S.P. | S.P. | S.P. |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+\r\n  |_Salt-acid Tan_    |  C.  |  C.  |  C.  |\r\n  |Australian Opossum |  53° |  52° | 54°  |\r\n  |                   |      |      |      |\r\n  |_Chamois Tan_      |      |      |      |\r\n  |Mink               |  59° |  59° |  59° |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+\r\n    A--1000 c.c. water plus 40 c.c.\r\n        Peroxide plus 5 c.c. ammonia\r\n    B--500 c.c. water plus 2 grams Ursol D\r\n        (Para-phenylene-diamine)\r\n    C--500 c.c. water plus 5 grams Ursol D\r\n\r\n                      TABLE III\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                   |  A   |  B   |  C   |  D   |\r\n  |                   | S.P. | S.P. | S.P. | S.P. |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |_Salt-acid Tan_    |  C.  |  C.  |  C.  |  C.  |\r\n  |Australian Opossum |  51° |  51° |  53° |  56° |\r\n  |                   |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |_Chamois_          |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |Mink               |  59° |  59° |  61° |  62° |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n    A--500 c.c. water plus 5 grams ground\r\n        nut-galls\r\n    B--300 c.c. water plus 2 grams pyrogallic\r\n        acid\r\n    C--500 c.c. water plus 2 grams potassium\r\n        bichromate\r\n    D--Water, after treating leather with\r\n        rapeseed oil\r\n\r\n                      TABLE IV\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |                   |  A   |  B   |  C   |  D   |\r\n  |                   | S.P. | S.P. | S.P. | S.P. |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n  |_Salt-acid Tan_    |  C.  |  C.  |  C.  |  C.  |\r\n  |Australian Opossum |  49° |  49° |  55° |  50° |\r\n  |                   |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |_Chamois Tan_      |      |      |      |      |\r\n  |Mink               |  59° |  67° |  69° |  70° |\r\n  +-------------------+------+------+------+------+\r\n    A--500 c.c. water plus 5 c.c. formaldehyde\r\n        for 1 hour\r\n    B--500 c.c. water plus 5 c.c. formaldehyde\r\n        for 12 hours\r\n    C--500 c.c. water plus 10 c.c. formaldehyde\r\n        for 3 hours\r\n    D--As in C, but treated with 500 c.c. water\r\n        plus 5 c.c. ammonia, instead of water\r\n        alone.\r\n\r\n            TABLE V\r\n  +-------------+------+------+\r\n  |             |  A   |  B   |\r\n  |             | S.P. | S.P. |\r\n  +-------------+------+------+\r\n  |             |  C.  |  C.  |\r\n  |Persian Lamb |  44° |  54° |\r\n  |Astrachan    |  47° |  55° |\r\n  +-------------+------+------+\r\n    A--Before dyeing\r\n    B--After dyeing\r\n\r\nAs a result of these experiments it may be concluded that the maximum\r\ntemperature for drying salt-acid tanned skins should be 40° C., while\r\nfor chamois tanned skins the temperature may be permitted to reach 45° C.\r\nwithout any danger of the leather being affected. Moreover, in the case\r\nof pickled skins, the matter of extraction of the tanning agent, as well\r\nas that of the leather becoming “burned” may be effectively counteracted\r\nby brushing some oil or fat on to the leather side before dyeing the pelt.\r\n\r\nThe shrinking points of skins dressed by the various tanning methods are\r\nconstant within certain limits, depending on the nature of the skin and on\r\nthe conditions of tanning, and it is possible by observing the shrinking\r\npoint, in conjunction with other characteristics of a given pelt, to\r\ndetermine what method of tanning was used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFUR DRESSING\r\n\r\nDRYING AND FINISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most important operations of all the fur dressing processes is\r\nthe drying of the skins. For even when all the previous steps have been\r\nsuccessfully completed, there is still a great possibility of the skin\r\nbeing injured if the drying is not properly and carefully carried out.\r\n\r\nThe essential requirements for good drying are proper temperature,\r\nuniformity and rapidity. The leather part of the fur cannot, in the\r\nmoist state, resist temperatures exceeding about 45° centigrade, for when\r\ndried, the skin turns out hard and stiff, and cracks easily. The furs must\r\ntherefore be dried at an initial temperature of 25° to 30° centigrade, and\r\nas the moisture is gradually removed, the temperature may be raised, for\r\nthe less water that remains in the pelt, the less is the leather affected\r\nby the heat, and the more difficult is the removal of its aqueous content.\r\n\r\nIf the drying process is not a uniform one, that is, if all the skins\r\nin a lot are not subjected to the same drying conditions, then after the\r\ndrying has proceeded for a certain time, some skins may be quite dry while\r\nothers are not, or there may be as many different degrees of dryness as\r\nthere are skins drying. There is also the possibility of great variation\r\nin the amount of moisture removed from different parts of the same skin.\r\nSuch a state of affairs requires an extra expenditure of time, labor\r\nand heat power in order to get the whole lot of furs into a more or less\r\nuniform condition. Moreover in some kinds of furs, especially those with\r\nthick skins, when the drying is not even, there is danger of the epidermal\r\nlayer drying away from the corium, and subsequently peeling and cracking.\r\nUniformity of drying requires the maintenance of a reasonably constant\r\ntemperature equally distributed throughout all parts of the space where\r\nthe drying is done, so that all the furs may be dried under the same\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nRapidity of drying is desirable not only because it is beneficial to\r\nthe condition of the pelt, but also from the point of view of practical\r\nbusiness economy. The space occupied by the drying should be as small\r\nas possible compatible with the volume of work, and with the efficiency\r\nof operation. Slow drying involves the use of much space to take care of\r\nall the skins to be dried, or an accumulation of pelts ready to be dried,\r\nneither of which conditions is efficient or desirable.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the general custom, still practised in some\r\nestablishments, to dry the skins by hanging them up, leather-side out on\r\nlines in a large room or loft, the heat being usually supplied by steam\r\npipes. Such a procedure occupied often as long as two or three days to\r\nget complete drying, involved a great deal of labor, and the results were\r\nfar from uniform. In fact, in order to get the skins more nearly equable,\r\nit was necessary to subject them to an additional operation. This usually\r\nconsisted of rotating the skins in a closed drum for several hours, the\r\nconstant intermingling of the pelts in contact with each other causing\r\nany moisture left in them to be evenly distributed throughout the whole\r\nlot. The skins, by this process also are rendered somewhat softer and more\r\nflexible, but by drying under proper conditions the entire extra operation\r\ncan be dispensed with, the furs coming out quite as soft and flexible\r\nwithout the drumming.\r\n\r\nA great improvement was the adoption of large fans to circulate the heated\r\nair in the loft, thereby approaching more nearly an even temperature.\r\nMore modern devices have, however, been developed, whereby drying can be\r\neffected in the most uniform manner, with perfect control of temperature,\r\nand requiring the least possible consumption of space, time, labor and\r\npower. A typical arrangement consists of a large closed chamber, generally\r\nconstructed of steel, and divided into several compartments each of which\r\nmay be operated independently of the others. Air, heated over suitably\r\nlocated steam pipes to the required temperature, is forced through the\r\nvarious compartments by means of fans operated by power. The conditions\r\nmay be varied in each compartment, as to temperature or humidity, both\r\nof which can easily be regulated, or all the compartments may be used\r\ntogether as one unit. The skins are hung up on rods or lines in the\r\ncompartments, or on special frames for the purpose, which are then entered\r\ninto the compartments and the doors shut. The dry, heated air is forced\r\nto pass over the skins, and takes up their moisture. At the further end\r\nof the drying chamber is another fan which removes the moisture-laden air\r\nafter it has done its work. The drying is effected in from 6 to 24 hours,\r\nand all skins are obtained in the same condition, for the process is quite\r\nuniform and regular.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years there has been evolved a highly efficient and\r\neconomical drying equipment, based on a somewhat different principle\r\nthan underlies any of the foregoing methods. The conveyor type of dryer,\r\nas it is called, is admirably suited to the needs of the fur dressing\r\nand dyeing industry, and is undoubtedly superior to any of the previous\r\nsystems of drying furs, in that it affords an enormous saving of space,\r\ntime, labor and power, and gives greater uniformity and presents better\r\nworking conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. DIAGRAMMATIC VIEWS OF CONVEYOR DRYER. _a._ SIDE\r\nVIEW; _b._ END VIEW.\r\n\r\n(_Proctor & Schwartz, Inc., Philadelphia._)]\r\n\r\nThe conveyor dryer consists essentially of a steel enclosure, through\r\nwhich the skins pass on horizontal conveyors. Where special insulation\r\nis necessary, asbestos panels are used to line the enclosure, making the\r\ndryer absolutely fireproof, and enabling the maximum utilization of heat.\r\nIn the middle of the dryer are located the steam coils which furnish\r\nthe heat, and in many instances exhaust steam can be used as the source\r\nof heat. Figure 10 shows diagrammatically the arrangement and operation\r\nof the conveyor type of dryer. The enclosure is divided into several\r\ncompartments, in each of which a different condition of temperature and\r\nhumidity is maintained, the temperature being closely and accurately\r\nregulated by an automatic control, and once the dryer has been set for\r\nany condition, all skins will be dried exactly the same, regardless of\r\nweather or season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. CONVEYOR DRYER.\r\n\r\n(_Proctor & Schwartz, Inc., Philadelphia._)]\r\n\r\nThe skins to be dried are placed on poles which in turn are set on\r\nthe horizontal conveyors as in Fig. 11. As the skins pass through the\r\ncompartments, large volumes of air, heated to the required temperature\r\nover the steam coils, are circulated among the skins by means of the fans.\r\nExhaust fans, properly placed, remove a certain quantity of moisture-laden\r\nair when it has accomplished its full measure of work. When the skins on\r\nthe conveyors have passed the full length of the dryer, they are entirely\r\ndry, and are then removed from the poles. (Fig. 12). The time required\r\nfor drying varies according to the nature of the fur from 1–2 hours to 6–8\r\nhours. In tests made to determine the relative efficiency of the conveyor\r\ntype of dryer as against the old “loft” method, it was found that there\r\nwas a saving of over 50% in power, and of 85% in floor space, as well as\r\na great saving of labor, when the conveyor system was used, the number\r\nof skins dried in a given period of time being the same in both cases.\r\nThe advantages of the new method are easily apparent, and the saving\r\nis sufficiently great with large lots of furs, to make an appreciable\r\ndifference in the final cost of dressing.\r\n\r\nIf the skins have been dried by a modern drying system they all come out\r\nin a uniform condition, and are ready to go on immediately to the next\r\noperation. If, however, a form of the “loft” method of drying has been\r\nused, it is customary to subject the skins to an additional process. The\r\ndried pelts are put in drums with damp sawdust, and drummed for a short\r\ntime in order to get them into the proper condition. The drumming is\r\nessential for the purpose of equalizing the condition of the pelts, some\r\nbeing drier than others, and as a consequence of the contact with the\r\nmoist sawdust, they are all brought to the same degree of dryness. As a\r\nresult of this operation also, the skins become considerably softened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. DELIVERY END OF CONVEYOR DRYER.\r\n\r\n(_Proctor & Schwartz, Inc., Philadelphia._)]\r\n\r\nThen if the pelts have not been previously oiled during the tanning\r\nprocess, or prior to the drying, they receive this treatment now. The oil\r\nor fat is applied to the leather side of the furs, which are then placed\r\nin the tramping machine for a short time in order to cause the oil to be\r\nforced into the skin. The fibres of the corium thus become coated with a\r\nthin layer of fatty material, which contributes greatly to the softness\r\nand flexibility of the pelt, and increases its resistance to the action of\r\nwater, and also, in certain instances a partial chamois tan is produced,\r\nthereby improving the quality of the leather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. STRETCHING MACHINE FOR CASED SKINS.\r\n\r\n(_Reliable Machine Works, Evergreen, L. I._)]\r\n\r\nThe skins are now returned to the work bench, and subjected to the\r\nstretching or “staking” process. This consists in drawing the skin in all\r\ndirections over the edge of a dull blade, which is usually fixed upright\r\nin a post with the edge up. Or, the stretching may be done on the fleshing\r\nbench, substituting a dull blade for the fleshing knife. Recently staking\r\nmachines are being used in the larger establishments, the work being\r\ndone much more quickly and efficiently. As a result of this operation,\r\nthe leather becomes very soft and flexible, every bit of hardness and\r\nstiffness being eliminated, and the skins receive their maximum stretch,\r\nthereby giving the greatest possible surface to the pelage. This not only\r\nhelps to bring out the beauty of the hair, but is also a decided advantage\r\nfrom the economic point of view, as a considerable saving of material\r\nis effected in this way, sometimes even to the extent of twenty-five per\r\ncent. Cased skins are stretched in a somewhat different manner, by means\r\nof stretching irons. These consist of two long iron rods joined by a pivot\r\nat one end. The skins are slipped on to the irons, which are then spread\r\napart, and in this way the skins are stretched and softened. A machine\r\nwhich does this work very efficiently is shown in Fig. 13. The skin is\r\ndrawn onto the stretching arms, in this case made of bronze, which are\r\nthen forced apart by pressing on a pedal. When properly stretched to the\r\nmaximum width in all directions possible, and thus thoroughly softened,\r\nthe skin can easily be reversed, that is, turned hair-side out. As many as\r\n6000 skins can be stretched, or 4000 to 5000 skins stretched and reversed\r\nby one man in one day on such a machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. FUR BEATING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n(_S. M. Jacoby Co., New York._)]\r\n\r\nThe pelts are then combed and beaten. In smaller plants these operations\r\nare done by hand, but suitable machines are being employed. In order to\r\nstraighten out the hair, it is combed or brushed. Then in order to loosen\r\nup the hair, and to cause it to display its fullness, the furs are beaten.\r\nThis process is also done by hand in some establishments, but up-to-date\r\nplaces use mechanical devices for this purpose. A type of machine which\r\nhas proven very successful, and is enjoying considerable popularity\r\nis shown in Fig. 14. These machines are also made with special suction\r\nattachments which remove all dust as it comes out of the beaten skin,\r\nthereby making this formerly unhealthful operation thoroughly sanitary\r\nand hygienic.\r\n\r\nThe final process is drum-cleaning. This operation is intended\r\nspecifically for the benefit of the hair part of the fur, and is very\r\nimportant inasmuch as the attractive appearance of the fur depends largely\r\nupon it. The drum, such as is shown in Fig. 15 is generally made of wood,\r\nor sometimes of wood covered with galvanized iron. The skins together with\r\nfine hardwood sawdust are tumbled for 2 to 4 hours, or sometimes longer.\r\nOccasionally a little asbestos or soapstone is added to the sawdust; for\r\nwhite, or very light-colored skins, gypsum or white sand is used, either\r\nalone, or in admixture with the sawdust; and for darker skins, graphite or\r\nfine charcoal is sometimes added in small quantities. The drum-cleaning\r\nprocess polishes the hair, giving it its full gloss and lustre, and at\r\nthe same time absorbing any oil or other undesirable matter which may be\r\nadhering to the hair as a result of the washing and tanning processes.\r\nAny soap, or traces of mordant are wiped off and so removed, and by using\r\nheated sawdust, or heating the drum while rotating, the fur acquires a\r\nfullness and play of the hair which are great desiderata in furs. The\r\nsawdust must then be shaken out of the furs. This is done by cageing. In\r\nsome instances, the drum itself can be converted into a cage, by replacing\r\nthe solid door with one made of a wire screen. (Fig. 16.) Usually,\r\nhowever, the skins are removed from the drum and put in a separate cage,\r\nwhich is built like the drum, but has a wire net all around it, through\r\nwhich the sawdust falls, while the skins are held back. The cages are\r\ngenerally enclosed in compartments in order to prevent the sawdust from\r\nflying about and forming a dust which would be injurious to the health of\r\nthe workers. In large establishments, the drum-cleaning machinery occupies\r\na large section of the plant, many drums and cages being used, and special\r\narrangements being made to take care of the sawdust which can be used over\r\nagain several times, until it becomes quite dirty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. DRUM. (COMBINATION DRUM AND CAGE AS A DRUM.)\r\n\r\n(_F. Blattner, Brooklyn, New York._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. CAGE. (COMBINATION DRUM AND CAGE AS A CAGE.)\r\n\r\n(_F. Blattner, Brooklyn, New York._)]\r\n\r\nWith this operation ends the ordinary procedure of fur dressing. But\r\nthere are several additional processes required in the treatment of\r\ncertain furs, which are generally undertaken by the dresser, and chief\r\namong these are shearing and unhairing. Sometimes this work is done in\r\nseparate establishments organized solely for this business. Certain kinds\r\nof furs, among them being seal, beaver and nutria, possess top-hair which\r\nmay detract from the beauty of the fur, the true attractiveness being in\r\nthe fur-hair. The top-hairs are therefore removed, and for this purpose\r\nmachines are now being used. Formerly this work was all done by hand, and\r\non the more expensive furs like seal and beaver, unhairing is now done on\r\na machine operated by hand. The principle of the process is as follows:\r\nThe skins are placed on a platform and the hair blown apart by means of\r\na bellows. The stiff top-hairs remain standing up, and sharp knives are\r\nbrought down mechanically to the desired depth, and the hair is cut off\r\nat that point. The skin is then moved forward a short distance, and the\r\nprocess repeated until all the top-hairs have thus been cut out. With\r\nmuskrats, or other pelts which do not require such very careful attention,\r\nthe whole process is done automatically on a machine. The fur-hair is\r\nbrushed apart by means of brushes and a comb, and at regular intervals,\r\nsharp knives cut off the top-hairs. Several hundred skins can be unhaired\r\nin a day on such a machine requiring the attention of only one man. A\r\nmachine for unhairing skins is shown in Fig. 17.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. UNHAIRING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n(_Seneca Machine & Tool Co., Inc., Brooklyn, N. Y._)]\r\n\r\nWith other furs, such as rabbits, hares, etc., where the trouble of\r\nunhairing would be too great commensurate with its advantages, the hair\r\nis sheared instead. The top hair is cut down to the same length as the\r\nunder-hair by means of shearing machines which can be regulated to cut to\r\nany desired length of hair. A typical device for shearing furs is shown\r\nin Fig. 18.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. FUR-SHEARING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n(_Seneca Machine & Tool Co., Inc., Brooklyn, N. Y._)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWATER IN FUR DRESSING AND DYEING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe assertion has often been made, although its absurdity is now quite\r\ngenerally realized, that the success of the European fur dressers and\r\ndyers, particularly in Leipzig, is due to the peculiar nature of the\r\nwater used, which is supposed to be especially suited for their needs.\r\nThe achievements in this country in the fur dressing and dyeing industry\r\nduring the past few years are ample and sufficient answers to the claim of\r\nforeign superiority in this field no matter what reason may be given, and\r\nparticularly when the quality of the water used is advanced as a leading\r\nargument. For the water employed by the establishments in and about New\r\nYork, as well as in other sections of the country is surely not the same\r\nas the water of Leipzig, yet the work done here is in every respect the\r\nequal of, if not better than the foreign products.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that similar rumors were current here in the\r\nearly period of the development of the American coal-tar industry since\r\n1914. Our efforts to establish an independent dyestuff industry were\r\ndoomed to failure, according to those who circulated the stories, because\r\nwe did not have the water, which they claimed was responsible for the\r\nGerman success. The present status of the American dye business, in its\r\ncapacity satisfactorily to supply most of the needs of this country and\r\nof others as well, speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, as is often the case with such erroneous assertions, there\r\nis just enough of an element of truth in the statement regarding the\r\npeculiar qualities of certain kinds of water, to make the matter worthy\r\nof consideration. Water is certainly a factor of great importance in fur\r\ndressing and dyeing, and it is not every sort of water that is suitable\r\nfor use. This fact was recognized by the early masters of the art, for\r\nthey invariably used rain-water as the medium for their tanning and dyeing\r\nmaterials, and their choice must be regarded as an exceedingly wise one.\r\nWhile the necessity for giving consideration to the quality of the water\r\nfor fur dressing purposes is great, it is in fur dyeing that the effects\r\nof using the wrong water are largely evident, and so extra care must be\r\nexercised in the selection of water for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe essential requirements for a water suitable for the needs of the\r\nfur dressing and dyeing industry, are: first, a sufficient, constant\r\nand uniform supply; and second, the absence of certain deleterious\r\ningredients. Chemically pure water is simply the product of the\r\ncombination of two parts by volume of hydrogen with one part by volume\r\nof oxygen. Such water can only be made in the laboratory, and is of no\r\nimportance in industry. For practical purposes, distilled water may be\r\nregarded as the standard of pure water. Here, too, the cost and trouble\r\ninvolved in the production of distilled water on a large scale is\r\nwarranted only in a certain few industrial operations. A natural source\r\nof water which in its character most nearly approaches distilled water\r\nis rain. In fact, rain-water is a distilled water, for the sun’s heat\r\nvaporizes the water from the surface of the earth forming clouds, which\r\non cooling, are condensed and come down as rain. Rain-water is usually\r\nregarded as the purest form of natural water. Exclusive of the first\r\nrain after a dry period, rain-water is quite free of impurities, except\r\npossibly for a small percentage of dissolved atmospheric gases, which\r\nare practically harmless, and which can usually be readily eliminated\r\nby heating the water. Moreover, rain-water is quite uniform in its\r\ncomposition throughout the year in the same locality, and it possesses\r\nall the desirable qualities of a water suited for fur dressing and dyeing\r\npurposes. Formerly when the quantity of water used in the industry\r\nwas comparatively small, the supply from rain was sufficient to meet\r\nall the requirements. But now, when tremendous quantities of water are\r\nused constantly, rain-water is no longer a feasible source, and other\r\nsupplies must be utilized, although in a sense, all water may be traced\r\nto rain-water as its origin.\r\n\r\nWhen rain-water falls on the earth it either sinks into the ground until\r\nit reaches an impervious layer, where it collects as a subterranean\r\npool, forming a well, or continues to flow underground until it finally\r\nemerges at the surface as a spring; or on the other hand the rain-water\r\nmay sink but a short distance below the surface, draining off as ponds,\r\nlakes or rivers. In the first case the water is called ground water, in\r\nthe latter it is known as surface water. Ground water usually contains\r\nmetallic salts in solution, and relatively little suspended matter. If\r\nthe water has percolated through igneous rocks, like granite, it may be\r\nquite free even of dissolved salts, and such water is considered “soft.”\r\nIf, however, the rocky formations over which, or through which, the water\r\nhas passed contain limestone or sandstone, or the like, salts of calcium\r\nand magnesium will be dissolved by the water. The presence of the lime\r\nand magnesia salts, as well as salts of aluminum and iron, in the water,\r\ncauses it to be what is termed “hard.” Surface water is more likely to\r\ncontain suspended matter, with very little of dissolved substances.\r\nSuspended matter, like mud, contains much objectionable matter such\r\nas putrefactive organisms and iron, but most of these materials can be\r\nremoved by filtration or sedimentation, and seldom cause any difficulties.\r\n\r\nHardness in water is generally the chief source of trouble when the water\r\nis at fault. Hardness may be of two kinds, either permanent, or temporary,\r\nor sometimes both are found together. Water which is permanently hard\r\nusually contains the lime and magnesia combined as sulphates. Temporary\r\nhardness, on the other hand, is due to the presence of lime and magnesia\r\nin the form of bicarbonates, the carbon dioxide contained in the water\r\nhaving dissolved the practically insoluble carbonates:\r\n\r\n    CaCO₃  +  CO₂  +  H₂O  =  Ca(HCO₃)₂\r\n   calcium   carbon  water     calcium\r\n  carbonate  dioxide         bicarbonate\r\n\r\nTemporary hardness can be eliminated by heating the water, the carbon\r\ndioxide being expelled and the carbonates of lime and magnesia being\r\nprecipitated and then filtered off. Both permanently and temporarily hard\r\nwaters can be softened by the addition of the proper chemical, such as\r\nan alkaline carbonate like sodium carbonate. This precipitates insoluble\r\ncarbonates of the lime, magnesia, iron and aluminum, leaving a harmless\r\nsalt of sodium in solution in the water. The sludge is allowed to settle\r\nin tanks before the water is used.\r\n\r\nIn fur dressing and dyeing, water is employed for soaking and washing the\r\nskins, dissolving chemicals, extracts and dye materials, and also for\r\nsteam boilers. A small amount of hardness in the water is not harmful,\r\nand up to 10 parts of solid matter per 100,000, may be disregarded.\r\nPermanent hardness is particularly objectionable in water for boiler\r\npurposes, as it forms scale. The effect of the impurities of the water\r\ndepends on the nature of the chemicals and dyes used. Where acids are\r\nused in solution compounds of magnesium, lime and aluminum will generally\r\nnot interfere. Hard water must not be used for soap solutions, as sticky\r\ninsoluble precipitates are formed with the soap by the metals, this\r\ncompound adhering to the hair, and being difficult to remove, will cause\r\nconsiderable trouble in subsequent dyeing. An appreciable loss of soap\r\nalso results, as one part of lime, calculated as carbonate will render\r\nuseless twelve parts of soap. In tanning or mordanting, where salts of\r\ntin, aluminum or iron are employed, hard water should not be used, as lime\r\nand magnesia will form precipitates with them. Bichromates will be reduced\r\nto neutral salts, and cream of tartar will also be neutralized. With dyes\r\nalso, hard water has a deleterious effect. Basic dyes are precipitated by\r\nthis kind of water, rendering part of the dye useless, and also causing\r\nuneven and streaky dyeings. Sometimes the shades of the dyeings are\r\nmodified or unfavorably affected. Considerable quantities of lime and\r\nmagnesia in the water will cause duller shades with logwood and fustic\r\ndyeings. The presence of iron, even in very slight quantities generally\r\nalters the shade, darkening and dulling the color.\r\n\r\nThese facts were apparently all recognized and understood by the fur\r\ndressers and dyers of an earlier period, for instead of utilizing the\r\nwater of lakes and streams near at hand, which afforded a more constant\r\nsupply, but which contained harmful impurities, they collected the\r\nrain-water, which was always soft. Whether they realized the nature\r\nand character of the substances that make water hard is uncertain,\r\nbut they were always careful to avoid such water. At the present time\r\nestablishments located in and about large cities like New York, where\r\nthe majority of American fur dressing and dyeing plants are situated,\r\nhave no trouble about the water. The cities supply water which is soft,\r\nsuitable alike for drinking and industrial purposes. Other plants, not\r\nso fortunately situated, often have to employ chemical means to treat the\r\nwater so as to make it suitable for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY AND HISTORICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing fur dyeing, the question naturally arises, “Why dye furs at\r\nall? Are not furs most attractive in their natural colors, and therefore\r\nmore desirable than those which acquire their color through the artifices\r\nof man?” The answer cannot be given simply. Natural furs of the more\r\nvaluable kinds are indeed above comparison with the majority of dyed furs.\r\nYet there are several reasons which fully justify and explain the need\r\nfor fur dyeing, for at the present time, this branch of the fur industry\r\nis almost as important and indispensable as the dressing of furs.\r\n\r\nThe first application of dyeing to furs, had for its purpose the\r\nimprovement of skins which were poor or faulty in color; or rather, the\r\nobject was to hide such defects. As nearly as can be ascertained, this\r\npractise was instituted at some time during or before the fourteenth\r\ncentury, for fur dyeing seems to have been common during that period, as\r\nis apparent from the verses of a well-known German satirist, Sebastian\r\nBrant, who lived in the latter part of the fourteenth century:\r\n\r\n    “Man kann jetzt alles Pelzwerk färben,\r\n    Und tut es auf das schlechste gerben.”\r\n\r\nHowever, at a later period, there was a general condemnation of the dyeing\r\nof furs, and among the list of members of the furrier’s guilds, none can\r\nbe found who are described as dyers. There is a record of a decree issued\r\nby a prince in a German city in the sixteenth century, prohibiting the\r\npractise of fur dyeing. Inasmuch as furs were worn only by the nobility\r\nand certain other privileged classes, and also were very costly, there\r\nwas great profit to be had by dyeing inferior skins so as to disguise the\r\npoor color, and then selling such furs at the price of superior quality\r\nskins. This was undoubtedly the reason for the prohibitory decree, but\r\nthere were some who continued to practise the forbidden art in secret,\r\nusing secluded and out-of-the-way places for their workshops, and mixing\r\ntheir carefully-guarded recipes with as much mystery as the witches did\r\ntheir magic potions. These circumstances probably account for the great\r\namount of mystery which has been, and still is to a considerable degree,\r\nattached to fur dyeing, and also explains the opprobrium and distrust with\r\nwhich fur dyers were formerly regarded.\r\n\r\nEven at the present time, dyeing is often employed to improve furs which\r\nare faulty in color. It frequently happens, that in a lot of skins there\r\nare some which are considerably off shade, or in which the color is such\r\nas to appreciably reduce their value below the average, the hair being\r\nusually too light a shade, or of uneven coloring. By carefully dyeing\r\nthese skins of inferior color, they can be made to match very closely\r\nthe best colored skins of the particular lot of furs, and consequently\r\nincrease their value. With most of the cheaper kinds of furs, the trouble\r\nand cost of improvement by dyeing would not be worth while today; but with\r\nsome of the more valuable furs, and especially such as are very highly\r\nprized, like the Russian sable, or marten, or chinchilla, the darkening\r\nof light skins by the skillful application of fast dyes to the extreme\r\ntips of the hair, will increase their value sufficiently to warrant the\r\nexpense. This dyeing or “blending” as it is called in such cases, is done\r\nin such a clever and artistic manner that only experts can distinguish\r\nthem from the natural. Dyeing used for such purposes is not objectionable,\r\nprovided the skins are sold as dyed or “blended.”\r\n\r\nThere are certain kinds of furs, such as the various lambs, Persian,\r\nAstrachan, Caracul, etc., which are never used in their natural color,\r\nbecause it is usually of a rusty brownish-black. These are furs possessing\r\nvaluable qualities otherwise, so they are dyed a pretty shade of black,\r\nwhich brings out the beauty of the fur to the fullest extent. Sealskins\r\nare also dyed always. Formerly they were dyed a deep, rich dark brown,\r\nresembling the finest shades of the natural color, but now the seals are\r\ndyed black with a brownish undertone, a color quite different from the\r\nnatural. While these two instances cannot be said to be cases of dyeing\r\nto disguise faulty color, they are examples of improvement of color by\r\ndyeing.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with the use of dyes to increase the value of a fur\r\nby improving its color, is the dyeing of skins of a certain lot of furs\r\nto produce a uniform shade, thereby facilitating or to a considerable\r\ndegree eliminating the task of matching the skins by the furrier. This is\r\nusually done only on skins which are quite small, of which a great many\r\nare needed in the manufacture of fur garments, because the matching of\r\nseveral hundred skins would entail too much time and labor commensurate\r\nwith the value of the fur. The most notable instance of the use of dyes to\r\nproduce a uniform shade on furs is the case of the moleskin. Occasionally,\r\nfurs are dyed after being made into garments, by careful application of\r\ndyes, in order to obtain certain harmonious effects, such as uniformity\r\nof stripe, or to produce a desired gradation of shade among the different\r\nskins comprising the garment.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently, the great variety of shades and color schemes which\r\nNature provides in the different furs, becomes insufficient to satisfy the\r\ndesire of the fur-wearing public for something new. The whims of fashion\r\nalways require some novel effect, even though it be for only one season.\r\nTo meet this demand for novelty, fantasy or mode shades are produced on\r\nsuitable furs,--colors which do not imitate those of any animal at all,\r\nbut which, nevertheless, strike the popular fancy. It often happens that\r\nsuch a color becomes quite popular, and enjoys a considerable vogue, to\r\nthe great profit of those who introduced the particular color effect. The\r\nbest ones, however, meet with only a comparatively short-lived demand,\r\nbeing soon superseded by different color novelties.\r\n\r\nThe basis, though, of the greatest proportion of fur dyeing at the present\r\ntime, is the imitation of the more valuable furs on cheaper or inferior\r\nskins. With the gradual popularization of furs as wearing apparel since\r\nthe beginning of the last century, the demand for furs of all kinds\r\nhas increased enormously. The supply of furs, on the other hand, and\r\nespecially of the rarer kinds, has had difficulty in keeping pace with\r\nthe requirements, and as a result there is a shortage. A very effective\r\nmeans of relieving this shortage, to a great degree, at any rate, is\r\nthe dyeing of imitations of the scarcer furs on cheaper skins. There\r\nare many animals among the more common, and more easily obtainable ones,\r\nwhose skins are admirably suited as the basis of imitations of the more\r\ncostly furs. Some of the furs which are adapted for purposes of dyeing\r\nimitations are marmot, red fox, rabbit, hare, muskrat, squirrel, opossum,\r\nraccoon, and many others, and the imitations made are those of mink,\r\nsable, marten, skunk, seal, chinchilla, etc., and indeed, there are very\r\nfew valuable furs, which have not been dyed in imitation on cheaper pelts.\r\nOn account of the general mystery which formerly surrounded fur dyeing\r\nestablishments, and which has persisted to this day, although to a lesser\r\ndegree, many peculiar notions were held, even by those in the fur trade,\r\nconcerning the production of imitations. The idea that in order to “make”\r\na certain fur out of a cheaper skin, it was necessary to use the blood\r\nof the animal imitated, is typical of the conceptions of fur dyeing held\r\nnot so long ago. To-day, while the knowledge generally possessed about\r\nthis branch of the fur industry is meagre and vague, the air of mystery\r\nand secrecy has become somewhat clarified, and such ideas as are current\r\nabout fur dyeing are more rational than formerly.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of imitations is quite an artistic kind of work, and indeed\r\nfur dyeing ought to be classed among the finest of industrial arts. Some\r\nof the reproductions achieved by dyers on a commercial scale are truly\r\nadmirable. The possibility of imitating the finer furs on cheaper skins\r\nnaturally led to abuse, the dyed furs being passed off frequently on the\r\nunsuspecting and uninformed buyer as the genuine original. In fact, this\r\npractise became so flagrant that in England laws were enacted to remedy\r\nthe evil. At the present time, dyed furs are all sold as such, although\r\nthere always may be some unscrupulous merchants who seek to profit by\r\ndeception. Some of the imitations and the names of the furs for which they\r\nwere sold, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Muskrat, dyed and plucked        sold as seal\r\n  Nutria, plucked and dyed         sold as seal\r\n  Nutria, plucked and natural      sold as beaver\r\n  Rabbit, sheared and dyed         sold as seal or electric seal\r\n  Otter, plucked and dyed          sold as seal\r\n  Marmot, dyed                     sold as mink or sable\r\n  Fitch, dyed                      sold as sable\r\n  Rabbit, dyed                     sold as sable\r\n  Rabbit, dyed and sheared         sold as beaver\r\n  Muskrat, dyed                    sold as mink or sable\r\n  Hare, dyed                       sold as sable, fox, or lynx\r\n  Wallaby, dyed                    sold as skunk\r\n  White rabbit, natural            sold as ermine\r\n  White rabbit, dyed               sold as chinchilla\r\n  White hare, dyed or natural      sold as foxes, etc.\r\n  Goat, dyed                       sold as bear, leopard, etc.\r\n\r\nThis list serves to indicate but a few of the great number of\r\npossibilities which are available for the fur dyer to produce imitations\r\nof the better classes of furs. Needless to say, these imitations cannot,\r\nas a general rule, equal the originals, because while the color is one\r\nof the most important features in judging the fur, the nature of the\r\nhair, gloss, waviness, thickness, and also the durability are essential\r\nconsiderations, and it is only in certain instances that skins used\r\nfor imitations approach the originals in these respects. However, for\r\nthe purposes and desires of the majority of people who wear furs, the\r\nimitations are deemed quite satisfactory, and they also have the advantage\r\nof being cheaper than the natural originals.\r\n\r\nFor whichever reason furs are dyed, there is no doubt that the art of fur\r\ndyeing is one of the most difficult kinds of application of dye materials.\r\nIn the dyeing of the various textiles, either as skein or woven fabric,\r\nthe material is of a uniform nature, and therefore the dye is absorbed\r\nevenly by the fibres. Moreover, textiles are dyed at, or near the boil,\r\nthe dyestuff being more uniformly and permanently taken up from solution\r\nby the fibre at elevated temperatures.\r\n\r\nHow different is the case with furs! Far from being homogeneous, furs\r\npresent the greatest possible diversity of fibres to be dyed. As already\r\nnoted elsewhere, fur consists of two principal parts, the hair and the\r\nleather, differing widely in their actions toward dyes. As a general\r\nrule, the leather absorbs dyestuffs much more readily than the pelage,\r\nand inasmuch as fur dyeing is intended mainly and primarily to apply to\r\nthe hair, there is usually an appreciable loss of dye material due to its\r\nbeing absorbed by the leather, and thereby rendered unavailable for dyeing\r\nthe hair. This fact must be taken into account in the dyeing of furs, and\r\nthe methods must be adapted accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the hair itself, not only has each class of furs\r\nhair of a different kind, but even in the same group there is always a\r\nconsiderable divergence in the properties of the hair. The fur-hair, being\r\nmore or less of a woolly nature, takes up the dye with comparative ease,\r\nwhile the top-hair is quite resistant to the action of all dye materials.\r\nAs pointed out in the discussion of the nature of fur, on different parts\r\nof the same pelt the hair varies in its capacity for absorbing coloring\r\nmatters. The color of the hair, also frequently presents a great variety\r\nthroughout the skin, both in fur-hair and top-hair. Yet with all this lack\r\nof uniformity and homogeneity, the dyed fur must be of an even color,\r\nclosely approaching the natural, gently graded and without any harsh or\r\nunduly contrasted effects. The natural gloss of the hair, one of the most\r\nvaluable qualities of the fur, must be preserved. This is by no means\r\na simple matter, for the luster is affected by dyes and chemicals with\r\ncomparative ease, and especially careful treatment is necessary to prevent\r\nany diminution of the gloss.\r\n\r\nWhen the leather part of the fur is exposed to solutions of a temperature\r\nexceeding 40°–50° centigrade, it soon shrivels up or shrinks, and on\r\ndrying the pelt, becomes hard and brittle, and therefore quite useless.\r\nMethods of fur dyeing have to take into consideration this fact, and the\r\ntemperature of the dyebath must not be greater than 35°–40° centigrade. To\r\nbe sure, certain dressings make furs capable of withstanding much higher\r\ntemperatures, but their applicability is not universal, being suited only\r\nfor a very limited special class of dyestuffs. (V. Fur Dressing). The\r\nnecessity for employing comparatively low temperatures, coupled with the\r\ngreat resistance of the hair to the absorption of dye, even at much higher\r\ntemperatures, makes fur-dyeing a very difficult operation indeed. Another\r\nobstacle which must be surmounted, is the possibility of extraction by\r\nthe dye solution, of those materials, chemical or otherwise, which are\r\ncontained in the leather, and which are the basis of its permanence,\r\nsoftness and flexibility. For in the majority of dressing processes, the\r\naction of the ingredients is a preservative one, and when these are wholly\r\nor partially removed from the leather during the dyeing, it becomes, on\r\ndrying, hard and horny, like the original undressed pelt. In cases where\r\nfurs are to be dyed, special dye-resisting dressings must be used, or the\r\ndyed skins must receive an additional dressing before drying.\r\n\r\nDyeings on furs, to have any value, must possess great fastness to light,\r\nrubbing and wear, and must not change color in time, either when the furs\r\nare stored, or when made up into garments. The necessity for fur dyeings\r\nto have these properties, together with the difficulties outlined above,\r\nhas greatly limited the field of available dyeing materials, as well as\r\nthe methods of application. These will now be taken up in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nGENERAL METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the furs can be dyed, they have to undergo certain preparatory\r\nprocesses: first, killing, which renders the hair more susceptible to the\r\nabsorption of the dye; and second, mordanting, which consists in treating\r\nthe killed fur with chemicals which help the dye to be fixed on the hair.\r\nThen the skins are ready to be dyed.\r\n\r\nThere are two principal methods by which dyes are applied to furs in\r\npractise: the brush process, whereby only the tips or the upper part\r\nof the hair are colored; and the dip process, whereby the entire fur,\r\nincluding the leather is dyed. All other procedures in fur dyeing\r\nare modifications or combinations of these two. Killing solutions and\r\nmordanting solutions are also applied by one of these methods, usually\r\nthe dip process, although very frequently combinations of the brush and\r\ndip methods are used.\r\n\r\nChronologically the brush method of dyeing came first. The early masters\r\nof the art were extremely fearful about employing any means by which\r\nthere was a possibility of the leather being in any way affected. They\r\nnaturally had to devise such methods as would give the desired effect\r\nin a satisfactory manner, and as would be confined solely to the hair\r\npart of the fur, leaving the leather untouched. By applying the dye\r\nor other material to be used, in the form of a paste with a brush, the\r\nupper portion of the hair only was treated. For different kinds of furs\r\ndifferent sorts of brushes were used, and the depth to which the hair was\r\ncolored could be controlled by skillful manipulation of the brushes. It\r\nwas frequently necessary to give a ground color to the hair, the lower\r\npart being dyed a different shade from the tips. This was accomplished\r\nby spreading the dye paste over the hair with a broad brush, and then\r\nbeating the color in with a specially adapted beating brush. With larger\r\nfurs, two skins were placed hair to hair after the dye had been brushed\r\non, and the color forced to the bottom of the hair by a workman tramping\r\non the skins. The dyeing of seal was a typical illustration of these\r\nprocedures. First the tips of the hair were dyed. The color was brushed\r\non, allowed to dry, then the excess beaten out with rods. These operations\r\nwere repeated until the proper depth of shade was obtained, often as many\r\nas a dozen or more applications of the dye being necessary. Then the base\r\ncolor was spread over the hair, and beaten or tramped in until the lower\r\nparts of the hair were penetrated. This process also required drying and\r\nbeating out of the excess dye, as well as numerous applications of the\r\ndye to impart the desired color to the hair. Prior to the dyeing, the furs\r\nwere killed, by brushing on a paste containing the essential ingredients,\r\ndrying and beating and brushing the fur, just the same as in dyeing. It\r\nwill be readily seen that such methods were exceedingly laborious, and in\r\nsome cases the dyeing took many weeks, and even months.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a step forward when a certain fur dyer, possessing a little\r\nmore courage, or perhaps, experimenting spirit than the others, attempted\r\nto dye furs by dipping them entirely into a bath containing a solution\r\nof the dye instead of applying a paste as formerly. The advantages to be\r\ngained by such a method of dyeing were many. A large number of skins could\r\nbe treated thus at one time, and this was a very important consideration\r\nin view of the great increase in the demand for dyed furs. By allowing the\r\nfurs to remain in the dye solution until the proper shade was obtained,\r\nthe time and labor of applying many coats of dye by brush was considerably\r\nreduced, and in addition, there was a greater probability of the products\r\ncoming out all alike, uniformly dyed. The results as far as the hair\r\nwas concerned, were indeed highly gratifying, but the condition of the\r\nleather after dyeing was not so encouraging. This difficulty has to a\r\nconsiderable degree been overcome, although there are frequent instances\r\nof the leather being affected by the dyeing process even with modern\r\nmethods. However, the remedy in such cases, or rather the preventative\r\nis the proper dressing of the skins prior to the dyeing. The dip method\r\nof dyeing has acquired great importance, and is being employed in dyeing\r\noperations involving the handling of millions of skins annually. In\r\ncertain instances, nevertheless, the brush method is of prime significance\r\nas in the dyeing of seal, and seal imitations on muskrat and coney,\r\nenormous quantities of furs being dyed in this fashion. In the majority\r\nof imitations dyed, both the brush and the dip methods must be used.\r\n\r\nFigure 19 illustrates the various types of brushes which are used at the\r\npresent time for the application of the dye by the brush method. Each\r\nbrush has a specific purpose and use. The procedure in brush dyeing is\r\nsomewhat as follows. The skins, after being properly treated, that is,\r\nkilled, and mordanted, are placed on a table, or work-bench, hair-side up.\r\nThen by means of a brush which is adapted to the nature and requirements\r\nof the particular fur, the solution is brushed on in the direction of\r\nthe fall of the hair, occasionally beating gently with the brush so as to\r\ncause the dye to penetrate to the desired depth. Considerable skill and\r\ncare must be exercised in this operation as it is rather easy to force\r\nthe dye down further than is wanted, and in some cases the leather or the\r\nroots of the hair may be affected. The skin having received its coat of\r\ndye, is then dried and finished, if no other dyeing processes are to be\r\napplied. Frequently, with certain types of dyes, several applications of\r\ncolor are necessary, and these are brushed on as the first one, drying\r\neach time. Then, on the other hand, the skin may receive a dyeing in the\r\nbath by dipping, and for this also, the fur is first dried after the brush\r\ndyeing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. BRUSHES USED IN FUR DYEING BY THE BRUSH METHOD.]\r\n\r\nQuite recently, owing to the great quantities of furs which are being\r\ndyed as seal imitations, chiefly by the brush method, although the dip\r\nmethod is used in conjunction with it, machines have been invented to\r\nreplace the hand brush, and the dye is now applied mechanically. Machines\r\nfor this purpose are by no means new, there being records of inventions\r\nalmost a score of years past, but they did not achieve much success.\r\nBrush-dyeing machines, to be efficient, must be designed to suit the\r\nneeds of the particular type of fur to be dyed, otherwise there will be\r\na great lack of uniformity in the dyed skins, a condition which cannot\r\noccur when the dye is brushed on by hand brushes. Figure 20A and B shows\r\ndiagrammatically, machines invented within the past few years, which are\r\nused to dye mechanically furs by the brush process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. TYPES OF MACHINES FOR DYEING FURS BY THE BRUSH\r\nMETHOD.\r\n\r\n_A._ (U. S. Patent 1,225,447.) _B._ (U. S. Patent 1,343,355.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. DRUM FOR WORKING WITH LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\n(_Turner Tanning Machinery Co., Peabody, Mass._)]\r\n\r\nFor the dipping process, the dye solution is prepared in vats, or\r\nliquid-tight drums, or in some instances in paddle arrangements. The\r\nskins are placed in the dye-bath, and the dyeing operation proceeds\r\nwithout any difficulty. After the proper shade is obtained, the furs\r\nare removed, washed free of excess dye, dried and finished. The dipping\r\nmethod is employed where a single shade is to be dyed on the fur, as the\r\nproduction of blacks on lambs. But in most cases, the dyeing in the bath\r\nis supplemented by the application of a coat of dye by the brush to the\r\nupper part of the hair, the color being usually a darker shade than the\r\nground dyeing. Thus, for example, in the dyeing of imitation sable on\r\nkolinsky or a similar fur, the skins are first dyed the relatively light\r\ncolor of the under-hair by the dip process, then the dark stripe effect\r\nis brushed on.\r\n\r\nThe blending of sables, martens, chinchillas or other rare furs, is not\r\ndone in the same manner as with other furs, because each skin requires\r\nindividual attention and a long and careful treatment. The dye solution\r\nis applied by means of very fine brushes or sometimes feathers, to the\r\nextreme tips of the hair, until the proper degree of color intensity is\r\nobtained. The time, labor, and skill necessary for this sort of work are\r\nwarranted only in the case of the highest-priced furs, and the blendings\r\nare so excellent as to defy detection, except by experts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. DEVICE FOR CONVEYING SKINS.\r\n\r\n(_Turner Tanning Machinery Co., Peabody, Mass._)]\r\n\r\nAfter the furs have gone through all the operations required by the\r\nprocesses of killing, mordanting, dyeing and washing, they are ready to\r\nbe dried and finished. The procedure is quite similar to that employed in\r\nfur dressing. Sometimes the leather side of the skins is brushed with a\r\nstrong salt solution before drying, in order to replace some of the salt\r\nwhich was extracted during the dyeing processes. In other instances, a\r\nlight coat of some oily substance is brushed on, to render the leather\r\nsoft and flexible after drying, where there is a possibility of the skins\r\nturning out otherwise. Great care must be exercised in the handling of\r\nthe dyed skins to avoid the formation of stains or spots on the hair,\r\nwhich might ruin the dyeing. As little handling of the furs as is feasible\r\nwill reduce any trouble from this source. In conveying the wet skins\r\nfrom one part of the plant to another it is desirable to use a device\r\nsuch as is shown in Fig. 22. For drying, the same machines as described\r\nunder Fur Dressing can be used, and similar care must be taken to avoid\r\noverheating or irregularity of drying. Drum-cleaning constitutes a very\r\nimportant operation in the finishing of the skins, the hair receiving\r\na polish, and the full lustre and brilliancy of the dye being thereby\r\nbrought out. Then after caging to remove the sawdust or sand, the skins\r\nare passed over the staking knife, or are treated in a machine suited\r\nfor the purpose, to stretch them and to render them thoroughly soft and\r\nflexible. And therewith is concluded the work of the fur dyer proper, and\r\nthe skins are ready to return to the furrier, in whose hands they undergo\r\nthe metamorphosis into the fur garments to be worn chiefly by the feminine\r\nportion of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\n“KILLING” THE FURS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf dressed furs are treated with a paste or solution of a dye properly\r\nprepared, and at the right temperature, the hair will show very little\r\ntendency to absorb the coloring matter. Even after prolonged treatment\r\nwith the dye, only a small amount will be taken up by the hair, and in a\r\nvery irregular fashion. Soft, woolly hair, like that of lambs and goats\r\nwill be colored more easily than that of furs with harder hair, and the\r\nunder-hair of a fur will generally have a greater affinity for the dye\r\nthan the harder and stiffer top-hair. Moreover, in some parts of the same\r\nfur, the hair will absorb more color than in other parts. In other words,\r\nthe hair of furs resists the action of dye materials to a greater or less\r\ndegree, depending upon the character of the fur, and also upon the part\r\nof the pelt. In order to overcome this resistance of the hair, and to\r\nrender it uniformly receptive to the coloring substances, the furs are\r\ntreated with certain chemical agents, the process being known technically\r\nas “killing.”\r\n\r\nThe origin of the term is obscure, but it is interesting to note that\r\nin the fur dyeing countries other than the United States and England,\r\nthe corresponding expression is used: in Germany, “töten,” and in France\r\n“tuer.” The explanation of the process is as follows: The surface of the\r\nhair is covered with a fine coat of fatty material which renders the hair\r\nmore or less impervious to dye solutions and solutions of other substances\r\nwhich may be used for dyeing purposes. This fatty coating of the hair\r\ncannot be removed by mechanical means, otherwise the hair would have\r\nbeen freed of it during the dressing operations. Chemical solvents must\r\ntherefore be resorted to, and naturally alkaline materials are used, these\r\nbeing usually cheapest and also most effective in their dissolving action\r\non fatty substances. Alcohol, ether, benzine, and other similar liquids\r\nalso serve as killing agents on furs, since they too, are fat solvents.\r\nIn all these cases, the fatty substance on the hair is dissolved away,\r\nand the protective coat which previously rendered the hair impervious\r\nto the dye, is now removed. There are certain chemicals however, which\r\nnormally do not dissolve substances of a fatty nature, but are strongly\r\noxidizing, such as peroxide of hydrogen, hypochlorites, permanganates,\r\nperborates, nitric acid, etc., and exert a killing action when they are\r\napplied to the hair, in that the hair is made capable of taking up the\r\ndye from its solutions. In this case the killing can hardly be said to\r\nbe due to a degreasing process. The fact that killing can be brought\r\nabout with other substances than alkalies or fat solvents, has led to\r\nthe belief on the part of some investigators in this field that killing\r\nis more than a degreasing operation, although the removal of the fatty\r\nmaterial of the hair undoubtedly takes place. Some authorities consider\r\nthat the killing process changes the pigment of the hair, which thereby\r\nbecomes more receptive to the dye. It is quite possible that some such\r\nchange in the structure of the hair fibre does take place, the surface\r\nof the hair becoming slightly roughened, and therefore more capable of\r\nfixing the coloring matter. The question is still an open one, and since\r\nno conclusive researches have been made as yet, it will be assumed that\r\nkilling is simply a degreasing process, inasmuch as the modern practise\r\nis based on this supposition, and very satisfactory results are obtained.\r\n\r\nAn account of the historical development of the killing process brings\r\nout many interesting and enlightening facts, so it will be given here\r\nbriefly. One of the first substances used for killing, or degreasing the\r\nhair of furs, was decomposing urine. Urine contains about 2% of urea which\r\ngradually changes to salts of ammonia, and in the presence of the air,\r\nlargely to ammonium carbonate. This substance has a weak alkaline action,\r\nbut sufficiently effective to be used for killing the hair of certain\r\ntypes of furs. Woolly furs, such as those derived from the various kinds\r\nof sheep and goats, were degreased with stale urine, the skins being\r\nwashed in this, and then rinsed in water. The fat was emulsified by the\r\nammonium carbonate present, and could thus be easily removed. For other\r\nfurs, a stronger mixture was necessary. An example of a killing formula\r\nused on wolf, skunk and raccoon, which were to be dyed black, is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  350 grams beechwood ashes\r\n  200 grams unslaked lime\r\n  150 grams copper vitriol\r\n  100 grams litharge\r\n   60 grams salammoniac\r\n   40 grams crystallized verdigris\r\n  3.5 liters rain water\r\n\r\nBeechwood ashes were a very important constituent of the old killing\r\nformulas. The reason for that lies in the fact that beechwood contains\r\na comparatively high percentage of potassium, which occurs in the ashes\r\nof the burned wood as potassium carbonate, or potash. The ashes alone\r\nwere frequently used, being applied in the form of a paste, which in\r\nsome instances had an advantage over a solution, in that the killing\r\ncould be limited to certain parts of the skin where it was more desired\r\nthan in other parts. By extracting the wood ashes with hot water, and\r\nevaporating the clear solution to dryness, potash could be obtained, which\r\nwas considerably stronger than the original ashes. Next in importance\r\nfor the killing was unslaked lime. This substance was also often used by\r\nitself, being first slaked with water, and using the milk of lime thus\r\nformed, after cooling. Salammoniac, although a salt, and consequently\r\nwithout any killing action, in contact with the beechwood ashes or the\r\nlime in solution or paste, liberated ammonia slowly, and so also acted\r\nas a degreasing agent. The other chemicals in the formula took no part\r\nin the actual killing of the hair, but acted either as mordant materials\r\nor as mineral dyes. The copper salts, in this mixture present in two\r\nforms, as sulphate in copper vitriol, and as acetate in the verdigris,\r\nwere important constituents of the dye formula, being essential to the\r\nproduction of the proper shade. These substances properly had no place\r\nin the killing formula. The litharge, also was not a killing agent, but\r\nin the presence of the alkaline materials of the killing mixture, it\r\ngradually combined with the sulphur contained in the hair, forming lead\r\nsulphide, and thereby darkening the color of the hair. In this case,\r\nthe metallic compound acted, not as a mordant, but as a mineral dye. The\r\nmixture was applied to the hair by means of a brush, the skins let lie for\r\nsome time, then dried, brushed and beaten. Many applications were usually\r\nnecessary to sufficiently degrease the hair. Inasmuch as the killing paste\r\nwas prepared by mixing the constituents together, and then was brushed\r\non at the comparatively low temperatures which the proper protection of\r\nthe hair required, it is questionable whether some of the metal compounds\r\nwere even enabled to act as described above as mordant or dye. In spite of\r\nthe trouble and considerable time required in working with such a killing\r\nformula to obtain the hair in the desired condition for dyeing, the use\r\nof such a mixture nevertheless possessed the advantage that the hair was\r\nonly very slowly and gradually acted upon, and so the gloss was preserved.\r\nThe action of strong alkaline substances acting quickly is more or less\r\ndetrimental to keeping the gloss of the hair, while the slow action of\r\nthe weak alkaline paste of the old formulas, and the gradual formation\r\nof a protective metal film on the surface of the hair, rendered the hair\r\nsuitably receptive to the dye which was subsequently applied, without in\r\nany measure affecting the lustre of the hair.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to describe or discuss any more of the old killing\r\nformulas, for the principle involved was the same in all cases, there\r\nbeing usually a slight variation in the content of metallic salts,\r\nbeechwood ashes and unslaked lime being constituents of the great majority\r\nof the mixtures used. Modern killing processes employ substances quite\r\nsimilar to those of the old formulas, the operations, however, being much\r\nless laborious and less time-consuming, and the cheap, pure products\r\nwhich chemical science has been able to develop being used in place of\r\nthe crude products crudely obtained from natural sources. The chemicals\r\nused at the present time for killing furs, are chiefly ammonia, soda ash,\r\ncaustic soda, and caustic lime. The choice of the killing agent depends\r\nupon the nature of the fur, the hair of some furs being sufficiently\r\nkilled by treatment with weak alkalies, while in other furs the hair may\r\nrequire stronger treatment. The ability of the hair of a particular fur to\r\nwithstand the action of the different alkaline substances must be taken\r\ninto consideration, there being a great divergence in this regard among\r\nthe different classes of furs. Raccoon, for example, is not appreciably\r\naffected by a solution of caustic soda of 5 degrees Beaumé, while some\r\nwolf hair cannot withstand the action of a solution of soda ash of less\r\nthan 1 degree Beaumé. Frequently much stronger alkalies are necessary to\r\nkill the top-hair than the under-hair, so this accomplished by treating\r\nthe skins in a solution which is suited to kill the under-hair, and\r\nsubsequently the top-hair is treated with a stronger solution, this being\r\napplied by the brush method.\r\n\r\nUniformity of action of the killing material on all parts of the skin,\r\nand on all the skins of a given lot, is absolutely essential to obtaining\r\nsatisfactory results in dyeing. And it is by no means a simple matter\r\nto get such uniformity, considering the numerous factors that must be\r\ntaken into account. Any operation involving the immersion of the skins\r\nin solutions or even in water alone, has an effect on the leather side of\r\nthe skin, inasmuch as some of the tanning materials may be extracted. The\r\napplication of some substance of a fatty nature to a great degree prevents\r\nthis, and the skin can be killed, mordanted and dyed, and then come out\r\nsoft and flexible. But the great majority of substances of a fatty nature\r\nare affected by alkalies, and so when the skins are being killed, the\r\naction of the alkaline materials would be upon the fat contained in the\r\nleather as well as that upon the hair. As a result the hair may not be\r\nsufficiently killed, and so give uneven dyeings subsequently. Either a\r\ncertain excess of the killing chemical must be used, and it would be very\r\ndifficult to ascertain what quantity would suffice, or the killing action\r\nmust be prolonged; but best of all, in oiling the skins, an inert mineral\r\noil should be used, since it is wholly unaffected by alkalies.\r\n\r\nSkins may be killed by the brush process or the dip process, or by both.\r\nFor brush killing, the stronger alkalies like lime and caustic soda are\r\nused, the solution being applied to the top-hair with a suitable brush,\r\nand the skins allowed to remain hair to hair for the necessary length\r\nof time, after which they are treated further as skins killed by the dip\r\nprocess. By this latter process, the furs are immersed in a solution of\r\nthe desired killing agent in a vat, or drum, or other appropriate device\r\nwhich will permit of uniform action of the alkali on the hair of all the\r\nskins. After remaining in the solution the required length of time, the\r\nskins are drained, and rinsed in fresh water, and then entered into a weak\r\nsolution of an acid in order to neutralize any remaining alkali, it being\r\neasier to wash out acid than alkali. The furs are then washed thoroughly\r\nin clear water, preferably running water, to remove the last traces of\r\nacid. The skins are then drained and hydro-extracted, or pressed, and are\r\nthen ready for the subsequent operations of mordanting and dyeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING WITH SODA\r\n\r\nSoda is sodium carbonate, which is produced commercially in a very pure\r\nstate in several different forms, the chief being sal soda, which is\r\ncrystallized sodium carbonate, containing about 37% of actual soda; and\r\nsoda ash, or calcined soda, which is anhydrous sodium carbonate. The\r\nlatter is the variety most commonly used.\r\n\r\n  10 grams soda ash are dissolved in\r\n   1 liter of water at 25°–30° C.\r\n\r\nThe skins are immersed for 2–3 hours, after which they are rinsed and\r\ntreated with\r\n\r\n  10 grams acetic acid dissolved in\r\n   1 liter of water.\r\n\r\nThe skins are again thoroughly washed, and then hydro-extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING WITH LIME\r\n\r\nLime, calcium oxide, forms a white, amorphous, porous substance, which\r\nreadily takes up water, giving calcium hydroxide, or slaked lime. Only the\r\nbest grades of lime should be used, as it is very frequently contaminated\r\nwith calcium carbonate and other inert materials.\r\n\r\n  10 grams of lime are dissolved in\r\n   1 liter of water.\r\n\r\nThe skins are entered, and allowed to remain for a period of time which\r\nvaries according to the nature of the fur. During the killing, the\r\nsolution must be agitated, in order to evenly distribute the milk of lime,\r\nwhich has a tendency to settle out. After rinsing, the skins are “soured,”\r\nby treating with weak acetic acid solution, then thoroughly washed, and\r\ndrained.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING WITH CAUSTIC SODA\r\n\r\nCaustic soda is used only on furs the hair of which is very hard and\r\nresistant to killing. Usually it is applied by the brush process, but in\r\nsome instances, the dip method must be used. In order to reduce as far\r\nas possible, the action of the caustic soda on the leather, the weakest\r\npermissible solutions are used, increasing the time of treatment, if\r\nnecessary. Caustic soda is a white, crystalline substance, occurring\r\nin commerce in lumps, but more conveniently in a solution of 40 degrees\r\nBeaumé, containing 35% of caustic soda. Various quantities, ranging from\r\n4 to 25 grams of this solution per liter of water are taken, according to\r\nthe character of the fur, and the skins treated for 2–3 hours, although\r\nweaker solutions may be used, and increasing the duration of the killing.\r\nBy keeping the solution in motion, by means of a stirrer or any other\r\nmethod of agitation, the best results are obtained. After the skins are\r\nsufficiently killed, they are soured, and washed as by the other killing\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nWhere the nature of the hair of the fur is such that the top-hair and\r\nthe under-hair require different killing treatments, the skins are first\r\nkilled by the dip process, with an alkali suited to kill the under-hair,\r\nthen a brush killing with a stronger alkali is applied to the top-hair.\r\nThe subsequent treatments are the same as for usual dip-killing methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nMORDANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hair of furs has the peculiar quality of fixing the oxides or\r\nhydroxides of certain metals from dilute solutions of their salts.\r\nAdvantage is taken of this property to mordant the furs, that is, to cause\r\na certain amount of the metallic oxide or hydroxide to be permanently\r\nabsorbed by the fibres. The term mordant comes from the French word\r\n“mordre,” meaning to bite, it being formerly considered that the purpose\r\nof a mordant was to attack the surface of the hair in such a way as to\r\npermit the dye to be more easily absorbed. In fact, killing mixtures,\r\nwhich were intended for this same object, used to contain the various\r\nchemicals which have a mordanting action, in addition to the alkaline\r\nconstituents. The mordants were not applied as such, but always as\r\nkilling materials. It was later realized, however, that the mordant was\r\ninstrumental in the production of the color itself.\r\n\r\nMordanting may be considered as having a two-fold object: first, to help\r\nfix the dye on the fibre in a more permanent fashion, thus rendering the\r\ndyeings faster; and secondly, to help obtain certain shades of color, as\r\nthe various mordants produce different shades with any given dye. Some\r\nclasses of dyes can be applied to furs without the use of mordants, but\r\nother types are taken up only in a very loose manner, being easily washed\r\nout from the hair with water, and it is only when such dyes are brought on\r\nto the hair in the form of a metallic compound, producing what is known as\r\na “lake,” that really fast dyeings are obtained with them. The substances\r\nwhich are used for mordanting the hair are certain metallic compounds,\r\nbut not all metallic salts which are used in dyeing are mordants.\r\nSometimes such a compound is employed to develop the color of the dyeing\r\nby after-treatment, as in the case of after-chroming, the action of the\r\nmetallic salt being directed only to the dye, and is not fixed by the\r\nfibre as a mordant must be. In order for a metallic compound to act as a\r\ntrue mordant, it must be fixed by the hair, and it must combine with the\r\ndye, thus forming a sort of connecting link between the dye and the hair.\r\nIt is not absolutely essential that the mordant be applied first, although\r\nthis is the customary and commonest practise. There are three ways by\r\nwhich the mordants can be fixed on the fur hair: First, by the absorption\r\nof the metallic oxide or hydroxide from a solution of the mordant prior to\r\nthe dyeing; second, the mordant may be fixed on the fibre at the same time\r\nas the dye; and third, the mordant may be applied after the fur has been\r\ntreated with the dye. The last two methods will be discussed in connection\r\nwith the dyes, as they are special cases.\r\n\r\nThe salts of metals which are comparatively easily dissociated in water,\r\nwith the formation of insoluble oxides or hydroxides, are most applicable\r\nas mordants for furs, and among them are compounds of aluminum, iron,\r\nchromium, copper and tin. The constituents of the hair seem to bring\r\nabout the dissociation of the metallic salt, and the oxide or hydroxide\r\nas the case may be, is absorbed and firmly fixed by the hair. Just what\r\nthe manner and nature of this fixation are, is still uncertain. It is\r\nsupposed that chemical combination takes place between the hair and the\r\nmetal. The course of this process may, as far as is known, be described\r\nas follows, taking, for example, the case of chromium sulphate: In dilute\r\nsolution, this compound gradually dissociates first into its basic salts,\r\nand finally into the hydroxide, the breaking up of the neutral salt being\r\ninduced by the presence of the fur-hair.\r\n\r\n  Cr₂(SO₄)₃ + 2H₂O = Cr₂(SO₄)₂(OH)₂ + H₂SO₄\r\n  chromium    water   first basic    sulphuric\r\n  sulphate            chrome salt      acid\r\n\r\n  Cr₂(SO₄)₂(OH)₂ + 2H₂O = Cr₂(SO₄)(OH)₄ + H₂SO₄\r\n                          second basic\r\n                          chrome salt\r\n\r\n  Cr₂(SO₄)(OH)₄ + 2H₂O = Cr₂(OH)₆ + H₂SO₄\r\n                         chromium\r\n                         hydroxide\r\n\r\nThese reactions take place within the fibre, after the hair has been\r\nimpregnated with the solution of the neutral salt, and when the compound\r\nhas been rendered completely basic, in other words has reached the form of\r\nthe hydroxide, it is supposed to combine with the acid groups contained\r\nin the hair substance, forming thus some complex, insoluble organic\r\ncompound of the metal within the hair. According to some authorities the\r\nmordant is supposed to be present in the hair simply as the hydroxide,\r\nbeing tenaciously held by some physical means. The facts seem to indicate,\r\nhowever, that the metal is actually combined in some chemical way with the\r\nhair. For, if the mordant were present as hydroxide, then on white hair it\r\nwould show the color of the hydroxide, which it does not. The same facts\r\nobtain with regard to other metals.\r\n\r\nIn order for the hair to be properly mordanted, it is necessary that\r\nthe metallic compound which is taken up by the hair be held in such a\r\nmanner that the mordant cannot be removed by water or even dilute acids\r\nor alkalies. Salts which dissociate too readily produce mordants which\r\nare only superficially precipitated on the hair and subsequently come\r\noff. Usually some substance is added to the solution of the salt to\r\ncause slower and more even dissociation of the salt, so that the hair\r\nsubstance can be quite saturated with the metallic compound before any\r\ninsoluble precipitate is formed. Dilute sulphuric acid, organic acids like\r\nacetic and lactic, and cream of tartar are used to facilitate the uniform\r\nabsorption of the mordant salt by the hair.\r\n\r\nWhen the skins are mordanted before dyeing, they are immersed for 6 to\r\n24 hours in a solution containing 1 to 20 grams of the metallic salts per\r\nliter of water, together with the corresponding quantity of the assistant\r\nchemical. The skins should be so entered into the mordant solution that\r\nthe hair is uniformly in contact with the solution, and all the skins\r\nso that they are acted upon alike. Machinery such as is used for killing\r\nis suitable for mordanting also. The duration of the mordanting, and the\r\nconcentration of the solutions are varied according to the depth of shade\r\nrequired, and also according to the nature of the dye to be employed. By\r\nsuitably combining several mordants a considerable range of colors can be\r\nobtained with a single dye.\r\n\r\nThe various chemicals used as mordants are essentially the same no matter\r\nfor which class of dyes they are used, there being only slight differences\r\nin the concentrations of the solutions, the manner of application of\r\nthe mordants being practically the same. It is interesting to note that\r\nwith the exception of chromium compounds, which are of comparatively\r\nrecent adoption as mordants, all the chemicals now used for mordants\r\nwere employed by the earliest masters of the art of fur dyeing. While\r\nsome of the formulas used by those dyers display a lack of appreciation\r\nof the true action and function of the mordanting chemicals, yet it is\r\nquite remarkable that they chose, in spite of their limited knowledge of\r\nchemical processes and phenomena, just those materials which do act as\r\nmordants if properly applied. The most important metallic compounds for\r\nmordanting furs at the present time are salts of aluminum, iron (ferrous),\r\ncopper, tin and chromium (as well as chromates and bichromates). The\r\ncompounds of the metals with organic acids such as acetic acid are\r\npreferable, being more easily dissociated, and also leaving in solution\r\nan acid which is less injurious to the fur than a mineral acid. However,\r\nsulphates and other salts of the metals are also used extensively,\r\ninasmuch as they are cheaper than the organic salts.\r\n\r\n\r\nALUMINUM MORDANTS\r\n\r\nChief among the aluminum mordants are the various kinds of alum, which is\r\na double sulphate of aluminum and an alkali such as sodium, potassium or\r\nammonium. All these salts except that of sodium, form large, colorless,\r\noctahedral crystals, and are soluble in about 10 parts of cold water,\r\nand 1/4 part of hot water. Sodium alum is even more easily soluble, but\r\non account of the difficulty of obtaining it in crystalline form, it\r\nis little used. The common commercial alum is the potassium aluminum\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\nRecently, aluminum sulphate has to a large extent replaced alum for\r\nmordanting purposes, because it can be obtained very cheaply in pure form,\r\nand it contains a greater amount of active aluminum compound than does\r\nalum. Only the iron-free salt, however, may be used for the needs of fur\r\ndyeing.\r\n\r\nAluminum acetate also finds extensive application as a mordant in fur\r\ndyeing, and while somewhat more expensive than the alum or aluminum\r\nsulphate, it has the advantage over these compounds of being combined\r\nwith an organic acid, which is preferable when the action on the hair and\r\nleather is considered. Aluminum acetate can be obtained in the market in\r\nthe form of a solution of 10 degrees Beaumé, but can also be prepared very\r\neasily as follows:\r\n\r\n   665 grams pure aluminum sulphate, or\r\n   948 grams potassium alum, are dissolved in\r\n     1 liter of hot water.\r\n  1137 grams of lead acetate (sugar of lead) are also dissolved in\r\n     1 liter of hot water.\r\n\r\nThe two solutions are mixed, and thoroughly stirred. A heavy white\r\nprecipitate forms, which is filtered off, and discarded after the solution\r\nhas cooled. The aluminum acetate is contained in the filtrate, and the\r\nsolution is brought to a density of 10 degrees Beaumé by the addition of\r\nwater, if necessary, and is preserved for use in this form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON MORDANTS\r\n\r\nFerrous sulphate, iron vitriol, or copperas, as it is commonly known,\r\nforms pale green crystals, which on exposure to air lose water, and\r\ncrumble down to a white powder. It is very soluble in both cold and\r\nhot water, but the solutions oxidize very rapidly, turning yellowish,\r\nand should therefore be used immediately. Care must be taken that a\r\ngood quality of iron vitriol be used for the mordant, otherwise very\r\nunsatisfactory results will be obtained.\r\n\r\nFerrous acetate is prepared in a manner similar to the aluminum acetate,\r\nand is occasionally employed instead of the ferrous sulphate. Inasmuch,\r\nhowever, as the solution of ferrous acetate is very easily oxidizable\r\nwhen exposed to the air, a more stable form is used, and this comes on\r\nthe market as iron pyrolignite or iron liquor. This can be prepared by\r\ndissolving iron in crude acetic or pyroligneous acid, or by treating a\r\nsolution of iron sulphate with calcium pyrolignite. Iron liquor is really\r\na solution of ferrous acetate that contains certain organic impurities\r\nwhich prevent, or rather, considerably retard the oxidation of the iron\r\nsalt, but which in no way interfere with its mordanting properties. The\r\ncommercial product can be had in various concentrations, but 10 degrees\r\nBeaumé is the most usual and most convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER MORDANTS\r\n\r\nThe most important copper salts used in fur dyeing processes are copper\r\nsulphate, or blue vitriol, occurring in large blue crystals, very soluble\r\nin cold and in hot water; and copper acetate, which is formed by treating\r\na solution of copper sulphate with a solution of the requisite quantity\r\nof lead acetate. Copper acetate can also be obtained in the form of\r\nblue-green crystals, very soluble in water, the solution becoming turbid\r\non prolonged heating, due to the formation of a greenish basic copper\r\nacetate. This insoluble compound is known commonly as verdigris, although\r\nit is not usually produced in the manner mentioned. Numerous fur dyeing\r\nformulas contain verdigris, but inasmuch as the basic copper acetate is\r\ninsoluble and thus incapable of reacting with any of the substances used\r\nin dyeing, it is assumed that the soluble normal copper acetate was meant,\r\nfor this compound is also sometimes called verdigris.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there must be mentioned here a compound which formerly found\r\nextensive use in fur dyeing. This is a double salt of copper and iron,\r\nanalogous to alum, ferrous copper sulphate, known as blue salt. It is very\r\nseldom used at the present time, being more effectively replaced by other\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM MORDANTS\r\n\r\nThe typical chromium mordant is chrome alum, which is a potassium or\r\nammonium chromium sulphate, constituted just like the aluminum alums, and\r\nforming crystals like these. More frequently used, nevertheless, than the\r\nchrome alum, is chromium acetate, which is prepared from it, either by\r\ntreating a solution of the chrome alum with a solution of lead acetate,\r\nor in the following manner:\r\n\r\n   50 grams of chrome alum are dissolved in\r\n  500 cubic centimeters of boiling water. To this is added\r\n   15 grams of 20% ammonia, diluted with 15 grams of water.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate which forms is filtered off, and preserved, the filtrate\r\nbeing discarded. After thoroughly washing the residue on the filter it is\r\ndissolved in dilute acetic acid, heating if necessary, to effect solution.\r\n\r\nOther chromium compounds of an entirely different type are also used in\r\nfur dyeing, these being chromates and bichromates, the latter finding\r\ngreater application than the former. Sodium bichromate is the salt most\r\nusually employed. This forms orange-red crystals which are very soluble\r\nin water, and in addition to its use as a mordant it also serves as an\r\noxidizing agent for developing or fixing certain dyes on furs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIN MORDANTS\r\n\r\nCompounds of tin find only limited application in fur-dyeing, the only one\r\nof importance being tin salts, stannous chloride, which occurs in the form\r\nof white, hygroscopic crystals, which must be preserved in closed vessels.\r\nIt is very soluble, but in dilute solutions it readily forms a basic salt,\r\nso stannous chloride is usually used in very concentrated solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALINE MORDANTS\r\n\r\nAfter the furs have been treated with the solution of some alkali for the\r\npurpose of killing the hair, they are always passed through a slightly\r\nacidulated bath to remove any alkali which may still be adhering. This\r\noperation must always be gone through before the skins can be mordanted\r\nor dyed, for if it were neglected, very uneven and uncertain results\r\nwould be obtained. This process, however, entails the expenditure of\r\nno small amount of time, labor and chemicals when large lots of skins\r\nare being handled. In order to eliminate this extra step of “souring”\r\nbetween killing and mordanting or dyeing, it has been proposed to use\r\nalkaline mordants which combine the killing and mordanting functions,\r\nand accomplish these two processes at the same time. The advantages of\r\nemploying such mordants are easily apparent. Cumbersome manipulation and\r\nhandling of the skins, with the attendant consumption of much time and\r\nlabor are reduced to a minimum, and besides there is no needless waste of\r\nchemicals as is the case in the ordinary methods of killing the furs.\r\n\r\nThe principle of alkaline mordants is not a strictly new one. If it\r\nbe remembered that the old killing formulas used by the fur dyers of\r\nan earlier age, contained metallic salts with mordanting properties in\r\naddition to the alkaline substances, which alone were effective as killing\r\nagents, it would seem that the suggested alkaline mordants were merely a\r\nrevival in modified form of the old processes. This is undoubtedly true\r\nin a large measure, for the killing mixtures which the old masters used\r\ncertainly embodied the fundamental principle of simultaneous killing and\r\nmordanting, although it was not recognized at that time.\r\n\r\nModern alkaline mordants have therefore been devised which can be employed\r\nfor killing and mordanting furs at the same time. They are prepared as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALINE ALUMINUM MORDANT\r\n\r\n  250 grams of potassium alum are dissolved in\r\n    1 liter of boiling water. To this solution is added\r\n  300 grams of soda ash, previously dissolved in\r\n  750 c.c. of water, and the resulting precipitate is filtered off,\r\n      washed and pressed, and then dissolved in a solution of 65 grams\r\n      of caustic soda in 1 liter of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALINE CHROMIUM MORDANT\r\n\r\n  250 c.c. of chrome acetate mordant of 20 degrees Beaumé\r\n  320 c.c. of caustic soda solution of 38 degrees Beaumé (32.5%)\r\n   10 c.c. of glycerine 30 degrees Beaumé (95%)\r\n\r\nThe solution of these substances is brought up to a volume of 1 liter by\r\nthe addition of 420 c.c. of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALINE IRON MORDANT\r\n\r\n   138 grams ferrous sulphate are dissolved in\r\n   362 c.c. of warm water. Cool and add\r\n    25 c.c. of glycerine. Then slowly and carefully add\r\n  25.5 c.c. of concentrated ammonia, taking care that no precipitate\r\n       forms.\r\n\r\nWhile these alkaline mordants seem to have much in their favor, there\r\nare certain possible objectionable features which must be considered.\r\nThe solutions of the mordants are generally very alkaline, and not every\r\nfur can withstand more than a limited quantity of alkaline substance\r\nfor longer than a comparatively short time. Suitable mordanting usually\r\nrequires a longer time than killing does, so with the use of the alkaline\r\nmordant, if the skins remain in the solution until sufficiently killed,\r\nthey may be insufficiently mordanted, while if the furs are treated long\r\nenough to be properly mordanted, the hair may have been over-killed.\r\nHowever, the idea of the alkaline mordant is a good one, and it is\r\nonly a matter of time and patient, scientific experimentation when the\r\ndifficulties of the method will be eliminated, and a much-desired process\r\nwill become a practical realization.\r\n\r\nThe general methods for applying the various mordants of all sorts follow\r\nclosely the procedure adopted for the killing formulas, and similar\r\nprecautions must be observed, in order to obtain consistently uniform\r\nresults. With the exercise of care, there is little reason for the\r\nmordanting operations to go wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter proper treatment of the skins in the mordants, they are removed and\r\ndrained off, then rinsed lightly in running water to remove the excess\r\nof mordant liquor, after which they can be directly entered into the\r\ndye bath. If it is not feasible to dye the mordanted skins at once, as\r\nis often the case, the skins are kept moist, and under no circumstances\r\nallowed to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nMINERAL COLORS USED ON FURS\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of the fur dyes now used, certain inorganic\r\nchemical substances were employed in addition to the vegetable dyes,\r\nfor the production of colors on furs. Even to this day such materials\r\nare used to obtain certain effects in special instances. The idea of\r\nemploying mineral chemicals undoubtedly originated in the textile-dyeing\r\nindustry, which at one time was dependent to an appreciable extent on\r\nmineral substances for the production of certain fast shades. Compounds\r\nof iron, lead, manganese, also of copper, cobalt and nickel were all used\r\nfor dyeing, either singly or in various combinations. In the application\r\non furs, the brush method was the only one practicable, as the skins would\r\nhave been ruined by dipping them into solutions of these chemicals in the\r\nconcentrations necessary for dyeing.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of furs with mineral colors involves the precipitation on\r\nthe fibre in a more or less permanent form of the sulphide, oxide or\r\nother insoluble compound of a metal, and can be brought about in several\r\nways. By what is known as double decomposition, that is, by the use\r\nof two solutions successively applied, the ingredient of one causing a\r\nprecipitate to form when in contact with the constituent of the second,\r\nthe color is produced on the hair. Another method is to use solutions of\r\nchemicals which decompose on contact with the hair, forming an insoluble\r\ncompound. In the first method the hair is alternately treated with the\r\ntwo solutions of the requisite chemicals, drying between each brushing,\r\nthe process being repeated until the desired shade is obtained. The second\r\nmethod merely requires the solution of the chemical to be applied to the\r\nhair, which is then dried, the color forming by itself.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the mineral dyes, and which is occasionally\r\nused to this day, is lead sulphide, formed by the double decomposition\r\nmethod by precipitating a soluble lead salt with ammonium sulphide, or any\r\nother alkaline sulphide. By simply brushing an aqueous solution of lead\r\nacetate, also known as sugar of lead, on a white fur such as white hare or\r\nrabbit, a light, brownish coloration is obtained due to the combination of\r\nthe lead with the sulphur of the hair. If the lead solution is carefully\r\napplied several times on this type of fur, until a sufficiently dark\r\ncolor is produced, it is possible to get a fairly good imitation of the\r\nstone marten. The brown color is very fast, being actually formed within\r\nthe hair. In most cases, however, for dyeing lead sulphide shades it is\r\nnecessary to use the two solutions. Thus the pale greyish or slightly\r\nbrownish-grey shades of the lynx can be reproduced on white rabbit or\r\nhare by this process. A solution containing 60 grams of lead acetate per\r\nliter of water is brushed on to the hair of the fur which has previously\r\nbeen killed in the usual manner, and the hair is then dried. A solution\r\nof 50 grams of ammonium sulphide per liter of water is next brushed on,\r\nand the fur again dried. Care must be exercised in handling the ammonium\r\nsulphide as it is a very malodorous liquid, the fumes of which are\r\npoisonous when inhaled. The alternate brushings are repeated until the\r\ndesired depth of shade is obtained. A very dark brown, approaching a black\r\ncan be obtained in this way. This color can be used for the production of\r\ncertain attractive effects. By brushing over the tips of the hair, which\r\nhas previously been dyed a dark brown by means of the lead sulphide color,\r\nwith a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid, or with peroxide of hydrogen,\r\nthe hair will become white in the parts so treated, due to the formation\r\nof lead chloride or lead sulphate, respectively. Thus white tipped furs\r\ncan be obtained, but the process is applicable only when the furs have\r\nbeen dyed by the lead sulphide method.\r\n\r\nPotassium permanganate is occasionally used to produce dyeings of a\r\nbrown shade on furs. Considerable care has to be taken in applying this\r\nsubstance, as it is possible to affect the hair. The strength of the\r\nsolution must be varied according as the hair to be dyed is weak or\r\nstrong. A cold solution of 10 to 20 grams of potassium permanganate per\r\nliter of water is brushed on to the hair, which is then dried. A brown\r\nprecipitate of manganese is formed on the hair after a short time, and\r\nthe process is repeated until the required shade is obtained. For furs\r\nwith harder hair, stronger solutions can be used. The dyeing is very\r\nfast, but it is seldom used, cheaper and better shades being obtained in\r\nother ways. Spotted white effects can be produced on the brown dyeing with\r\npermanganate of potash by applying a solution of sodium bisulphite, the\r\nbrown color being dissolved by this chemical.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of other metals, such as iron, copper, cobalt and nickel\r\nare not used in practise as the dyeings are not fast, and can be better\r\nproduced in other ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE DYES\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the few shades which could be produced solely by\r\nmeans of coloring matters of a chemical character, all dyeings on furs up\r\nto about thirty years ago were made with dye substances obtained from the\r\nvegetable kingdom, either alone, or in conjunction with the aforementioned\r\nmineral colors. The colors of vegetable origin used in comparatively\r\nrecent times were mainly extracts of the wood of certain trees; so the\r\nname “wood dyes” has come to be applied generally to the dyes of this\r\nclass. The use of the vegetable or natural dyes on furs dates back to\r\nquite ancient times, as frequent allusions and descriptions in Biblical\r\nand other contemporaneous literature testify. There are numerous pictures\r\non monuments and tablets illustrating the dyeing of furs among the ancient\r\nEgyptians, the evidence indicating that the juice of certain berries, and\r\nextracts of certain leaves were used for the purpose. At a later period,\r\nin the Roman era, henna, which was used over two thousand years ago as\r\nto-day for the beautification of the hair of women, was also used to\r\ncolor fur skins. The instances cited here are merely of scientific and\r\nhistorical interest, and are not of practical importance as far as fur\r\ndyeing methods are concerned.\r\n\r\nIt was not until many centuries later that the dyeing of furs took on\r\nthe aspects of a commercial art, and the substances then employed were\r\nchiefly tannin-containing materials such as gall-nuts and sumach, which\r\nin conjunction with certain metallic salts, particularly those of iron,\r\nwere capable of producing dark shades. The use of iron compounds to form\r\ndark grey or black colors on leather tanned by means of the tannins, had\r\nbeen common for a long time, and it was natural that fur dyers should\r\ntry to produce such shades on furs in a similar fashion. The use of the\r\niron-tannin compound as a dye proved to be very effective, and to this day\r\nthe production of blacks by means of the vegetable coloring matters has as\r\na basis an iron-tannate. A formula in common use in the latter seventeenth\r\nand the eighteenth centuries for producing black shades on furs, is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Lime water                1117 parts\r\n  Gall-nuts                 1500   „\r\n  Litharge                   500   „\r\n  Salammoniac                 65   „\r\n  Alum                       128   „\r\n  Verdigris                   64   „\r\n  Antimony                    64   „\r\n  Minium                      32   „\r\n  Iron filings               128   „\r\n  Green copperas             384   „\r\n\r\nAll these substances except the gall-nuts, the copperas and half the lime\r\nwater were boiled up in a cauldron; then the gall-nuts and the copperas\r\nwere placed in a bucket and the contents of the cauldron poured in, and\r\nthe rest of the lime water added. The mixture was stirred up, allowed to\r\nsettle for an hour, and when cool, was ready to be applied by the brush\r\nmethod. For dyeing by the dip process, a similar mixture was used, only\r\nconsiderably diluted with water. A study of the formula discloses the\r\nfact that in it are combined killing and mordanting substances as well\r\nas dyeing materials. The lime water, in conjunction with the salammoniac\r\nserves as a killing agent, the verdigris, copperas and alum are mordants,\r\nwhile the litharge and the minium, both compounds of lead, could possibly\r\nact as mineral dyes, and the iron filings and the antimony took virtually\r\nno part at all in the dyeing, except, perhaps to act in a mechanical way.\r\n\r\nThe formulas for other shades were made up along similar lines, the chief\r\nconstituent of vegetable nature being either gall-nuts, sumach, or both.\r\nA mixture for a chestnut brown, for example, contained gall-nuts, sumach,\r\nand the various other mineral constituents as in the black dye, litharge,\r\nalum, copperas, verdigris, salammoniac, antimony, and in addition, red\r\nlead and white lead. It is evident in both these instances that the shade\r\nobtained was as much the result of mineral dyeing as of vegetable dyeing.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America introduced into Europe many new dye substances,\r\nchiefly wood extracts such as logwood and Brazilwood, but it was not until\r\nthe nineteenth century that these materials found their way into the\r\ndye formulas of the fur dyer. Most of the processes used in the dyeing\r\nof furs were adaptations of methods employed in silk dyeing, the silk\r\nfibre being considered as most nearly approaching fur-hair in nature and\r\ncharacteristics. By devious and circuitous paths the formulas of the silk\r\ndyers reached the fur people, and so, in the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, dye mixtures containing the various dyewoods as well as the\r\ntannin-containing substances were in general use for the dyeing of furs.\r\nThe following is a typical recipe of that time for the production of black\r\non furs like wolf, skunk, raccoon, etc.:\r\n\r\n  Roasted gall-nuts         1000 parts\r\n  Sumach                     200   „\r\n  Iron mordant               200   „\r\n  Copper vitriol             100   „\r\n  Litharge                    80   „\r\n  Alum                        60   „\r\n  Salammoniac                 50   „\r\n  Crystallized verdigris      40   „\r\n  French logwood extract      30   „\r\n  Rain water                7000   „\r\n\r\nThe mixture was boiled up, and after cooling was ready for application by\r\nthe brush method, the skins being first killed by a killing mixture also\r\napplied by the brush. The dye substances in this case are the gall-nuts,\r\nsumach and the logwood extract, with the iron mordant, copper vitriol, and\r\nalum as mordants. For brown shades a similar formula was used containing\r\nPernambuco wood extract, logwood extract, quercitron bark, gall-nuts and\r\ndragonblood, together with iron, copper and alum mordants.\r\n\r\nFormulas such as the above were mainly empirical, that is, they\r\nwere compounded as a result of trial of various combinations of the\r\nconstituents, without considering the nature and quantitative character\r\nof the reactions, as long as the desired shades could be obtained. Such\r\ndye mixtures were frequently found to yield results varying from those\r\nexpected or originally obtained, because the effectiveness of the formulas\r\ndepended upon the exact duplication in every detail, of conditions which\r\nhad given satisfactory results previously, and it was not always possible\r\nto attain such an accurate reproduction of circumstances, especially\r\nwhen the fur dyers were quite ignorant of the scientific relationships\r\nof the materials used. So when more light had been shed on the nature\r\nand chemical characteristics of the vegetable dye substances, formulas\r\nlike those described were no longer employed, although the essential\r\ningredients were the same in the new processes. Unnecessary constituents\r\nwere eliminated, and proper ones substituted where it was required, and\r\nthe quantities of the materials used were made to conform to the chemical\r\nlaws governing the reactions. Since these new formulas were based on a\r\nrational understanding of the constituents and their reactions, it is\r\ndesirable to study the latter briefly, before further discussing the\r\nformulas themselves.\r\n\r\nThe substances of vegetable origin used in modern fur dyeing may be\r\ngrouped into two classes, one, the tannin-containing materials, and\r\nthe other, the dyewoods proper. The most important of the tannins are\r\ngall-nuts, sumach and chestnut extract. Cutch, which also comes under\r\nthis class, is more frequently used for the production of brown shades,\r\nso it is grouped with the dyewoods. Among the latter are logwood, fustic,\r\nBrazilwood, quercitron, turmeric, and several others of less significance.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Tannin Materials_\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost under this heading are the nutgalls. These are\r\nball-shaped excrescences produced on certain plants by the punctures\r\nof insects in depositing their eggs. There are two chief varieties, the\r\nEuropean, and the Chinese. The European galls are formed by the female\r\ngall-wasp which drops an egg in the rind of young branches of certain\r\noaks. A swelling (the nutgall) is produced, in which the young insect\r\ndevelops, and from which it finally escapes by piercing a hole through\r\nthe shell. Those galls which are not pierced have a fresh bluish or green\r\ncolor, are heavy and contain most tannic acid. After the insect has gone\r\nout, the galls are of a lighter, yellowish color, and also of inferior\r\nquality. The best oak-galls are the Aleppo, and the Turkish or Levant\r\ngalls, containing 55–60% of tannic acid, and about 4% of gallic acid. The\r\nChinese galls are produced by the puncture of a plant-louse on the leaves\r\nand leaf-stalks of a species of sumach, and not on oaks. The galls are\r\nvery light, and very rich in tannic acid, containing often as much as 80%.\r\nFor dyeing purposes, nutgalls are usually ground to a powder, and in some\r\ninstances they are even roasted first and then ground.\r\n\r\nSumach consists of the leaves and sometimes of the small twigs and stems\r\nof a species of sumach plant known as the Rhus coriaria. The Sicilian\r\nvariety is the finest commercial quality, with the Virginian ranking next.\r\nIt is sold as a powder, but also in the form of the whole or crushed\r\nleaves. The best sumach contains 15–25% of tannin. Extracts are also\r\nmanufactured, a liquid extract of 52 degrees Twaddell, which forms a dark\r\nbrown, thick paste; and a solid extract, formed by evaporating the liquid\r\nextract to dryness.\r\n\r\nChestnut extract is prepared from the wood of the chestnut oak, which\r\ncontains 8–10% of tannin. The solid extract has a bright, black color,\r\nwhile the liquid extract is a dark brown paste with a smell like that of\r\nburnt sugar.\r\n\r\nThe tannins all give greyish to black shades with iron salts, and it is\r\nthis fact which renders them important for fur dyeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Wood dyes_\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of all the natural dye substances, especially\r\nfor the production of blacks, is logwood. The color is really a red, but\r\nwith the common mordants it forms blue, violet or black shades. Logwood,\r\nor campeachy wood, as it is sometimes called, is the product of a large\r\ntree growing in the West Indies, and Central and South America. When\r\nfreshly cut, the wood is practically without color, but when exposed to\r\nthe air it soon becomes a dark reddish-brown on the surface. The coloring\r\nprinciple of logwood is called hematoxylin, which is a colorless substance\r\nwhen pure, and is of itself incapable of dyeing; but when it is exposed\r\nto the air, especially when moist and in the presence of some alkaline\r\nsubstance, it is converted into hematein, which is the real coloring\r\nmatter of logwood. To prepare the wood for use, the logs are chipped or\r\nrasped, the chips being heaped up and moistened with water. Fermentation\r\noccurs, and the heaps are frequently turned to allow free access of air to\r\nthe wood, and to prevent overheating. As a result of this process, a great\r\npart of the hematoxylin is converted to the hematein. The logwood may\r\nbe used for dyeing in this state as chips, but logwood extracts can now\r\nbe obtained of a high degree of purity and are easier to work with. The\r\ncommercial forms of the extract, are the liquid of 51 degrees Twaddell,\r\nand the solid extract. Hematein crystals can also be obtained. All these\r\nextracts contain mainly hematein, together with a small percentage of\r\nhematoxylin which is converted to the former during the dyeing process.\r\nLogwood is never used as a direct dye, but is used to form color lakes\r\nwith the various mordants, the following colors being produced:\r\n\r\n  Iron mordants give grey to black shades\r\n  Copper mordants give green-blue to black shades\r\n  Chrome mordants give blue to black shades\r\n  Aluminum mordants give violet shades\r\n  Tin mordants give purple shades\r\n\r\nBy combining several of the mordants, any desired shade of black can be\r\nobtained, and if other dyewoods are used in conjunction with the logwood,\r\nthe range can be further increased.\r\n\r\nFustic, yellow-wood, or Cuba wood, as it is variously called, is obtained\r\nfrom a tree also growing in the West Indies, Central and South America.\r\nIt is used either as wood chips, or as a paste extract of 51 degrees\r\nTwaddell, and occasionally as solid extract. Fustic contains two coloring\r\nmatters, morintannic acid, possessing the characteristics of a tannin, and\r\nwhich is quite soluble in water, and morin, which is rather insoluble, and\r\nwhich settles out from the liquid extract. Fustic is the most important of\r\nthe yellow dyes of natural origin, and is used considerably in fur dyeing\r\nwith logwood for shading the blacks, or for producing compound shades.\r\nWith the usual mordants fustic gives the following colors:\r\n\r\n  With iron salts           dark olive\r\n  With copper salts         olive\r\n  With chrome salts         olive-yellow to brownish-yellow\r\n  With aluminum salts       yellow\r\n  With tin salts            bright yellow to orange-yellow\r\n\r\nBrazilwood, or redwood, is the product of a tree found in Brazil, and\r\nexists in several varieties, such as peach wood, Sapan wood, Lima wood,\r\nand Pernambuco wood. They all yield similar shades with the various\r\nmordants, and all seem to contain the same coloring principle, brasilin,\r\nwhich, like the hematoxylin, has no dyeing power, but by fermentation and\r\noxidation it is converted to brasilein, corresponding to the formation\r\nof hematein. Brazilwood and the related woods are used either as chips or\r\nextract, but seldom alone, usually in conjunction with other dyewoods. By\r\ncombining logwood, fustic and Brazilwood in various proportions, and by\r\nemploying suitable mordants, all the shades required by the fur dyer can\r\neasily be produced.\r\n\r\nQuercitron is the inner bark of a species of oak (Quercus tinctoria) found\r\nin the United States. It contains two coloring principles, quercetrin and\r\nquercetin. The fresh decoction of quercitron bark is a transparent dull\r\norange-red which soon becomes turbid and deposits a yellow crystalline\r\nmass. It is generally used in conjunction with other dyes.\r\n\r\nCutch is the dried extract obtained from a species of acacia, the\r\nprincipal varieties being Bombay, Bengal, and Gambier cutch. It contains\r\ntwo coloring principles, catechin and catechu-tannic acid. Cutch acts as\r\na tannin, and like other tannins discussed above, can be used for the\r\nproduction of grey or black shades with iron mordants. It is employed\r\nchiefly, however, for dyeing browns. Aluminum salts give with cutch\r\na yellowish-brown, tin salts give a lighter yellow, copperas gives a\r\nbrownish-grey, and chrome and copper salts give brown shades.\r\n\r\nTurmeric is the underground stem of the Curcuma tinctoria, the coloring\r\nprinciple being called curcumin. It may be used as a direct dye, but\r\nusually a mordant is used. Turmeric is sometimes used in place of fustic.\r\n\r\nWhile the tannins can be used alone with an iron mordant for producing\r\ngreyish to black shades, the dyewoods alone yield colors which would be\r\ntoo bright to be suitable for dyeing furs. In order to tone down this\r\nbrightness, and to give to the dyeings that greyish undertone which is\r\ncharacteristic of the natural furs, and which can only be imitated by\r\nmeans of the iron-tannin compound, it is customary to combine the tannins\r\nwith the wood dyes. The iron-tannate constitutes the foundation of the\r\ncolor which gets its intensity, and necessary brilliancy and bloom from\r\nthe wood dyes. Moreover, the presence of the iron-tannin compound helps\r\nconsiderably to increase the fastness of the dyeing. Furs dyed with the\r\ncombination of the tannins and the wood dyes obtain an additional tanning\r\ntreatment which materially improves the quality of the leather, for not\r\nonly do the tannin substances exert this tanning action, but the dyewoods\r\nas well, for they are themselves either of the nature of tannins, or\r\ncontain a coloring principle which is a tannin. It is to the combined\r\neffects of the tannin substances and the dyewoods that furs dyed with\r\nvegetable dyes owe their beauty of color, lustre, naturalness of shade,\r\npermanence of the dyeing, and durability of the leather. Wood dyeings\r\non furs have for this reason acquired a just renown, but owing to the\r\nintroduction of the new kinds of fur dyes, the use of the vegetable dye\r\nsubstances has been greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe dyes of vegetable origin can be applied to furs by either the brush\r\nmethod or the dip method, or both, and since mordants are required\r\nwith the dyes of this class, they are applied in one of the three ways\r\nmentioned in a previous chapter: first, by mordanting before dyeing;\r\nsecond, by applying mordant and dye simultaneously; and third, by\r\nmordanting after the skins have been treated with the dye.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. DYEING WITH VEGETABLE DYES BY THE BRUSH METHOD\r\n\r\nThe use of the brush method in applying the natural dyes to furs is\r\nlimited to a comparatively few kinds of dyeing, namely to produce\r\nspecial effects on furs, or to give to the upper-hair of furs a coat\r\nof dye different from the base color. In a quite recent German patent\r\nis described a process for blending a red fox as a silver fox and\r\nthe procedure affords a good example of brush dyeing with preliminary\r\nmordanting. The specification is as follows: “D. R. P. 310, 425 (1918).\r\nA process for dyeing red fox as silver fox. The tanned and dressed skin\r\nis first superficially decolorized by applying a dilute mixture of milk\r\nof lime, iron vitriol and alum, with a soft brush so as only to penetrate\r\nthe top-hair. Allow to remain for 4–6 hours, dry, and beat out the dust.\r\nA dilute solution of iron vitriol is brushed on so as only to wet the\r\ntop-hair, and the skin is thus allowed to remain moist for 12–24 hours.\r\nThen without drying, a solution of iron vitriol, salammoniac, litharge,\r\nred argol and wood ashes is brushed on cold with a hard brush so as\r\nto penetrate all the hair down to very near the skin. The skin has now\r\ncompletely lost its red color, and has become a pale yellow. It is now\r\nready to be dyed. An infusion of roasted nutgalls, which have been boiled\r\nfor 3–4 hours with water, is applied cold with a soft brush to the upper\r\nhair. Allow to remain so for 2–3 hours, and without drying, apply a weaker\r\nsolution of the roasted nutgalls with a hard brush so as to saturate the\r\nhair thoroughly. Dry and beat out. According to the concentration of the\r\nsolution applied, the hair will be colored blue-grey to black, and the\r\nshade can be varied by varying the strength of the solutions used. The\r\ndifferent parts of the skin, or those parts of different shades can be\r\ndyed accordingly.”\r\n\r\nIn this patent all the operations, including killing, mordanting and\r\ndyeing are done by the brush method, and the process, from this point\r\nof view is quite similar to one which might have been employed a century\r\nprevious. It is evident that the time and effort required to carry out the\r\ndetails as described in the patent would only be warranted in exceptional\r\ncases, where the value of the dyed fur would be considerably greater than\r\nthat of the natural skin.\r\n\r\nAn example of the application at the same time of dye and mordant by the\r\nbrush method is the original French Seal dye, which is still employed to\r\na limited extent to produce a brilliant, deep, lustrous black topping on\r\nfurs which have already been dyed by the dip process. A typical formula\r\nfor the old French Seal dye is the following:\r\n\r\n  Green copperas             10 parts\r\n  Alum                       10   „\r\n  Verdigris                  10   „\r\n  Gall-nuts                  80   „\r\n  Logwood extract\r\n    (15 degrees Twaddell)   150   „\r\n  Water                    1000   „\r\n\r\nThis mixture is applied to the top of the hair of the furs, after previous\r\nkilling, and the skins allowed to remain moist for several hours, and\r\nalso exposed to the air. The skins are then dried, and beaten out, and if\r\nnecessary a second coat of dye is brushed on. In dyeing seal-imitation\r\non muskrat, or skunk-imitation on opossum, for example, the black color\r\nrequired on the top-hair, or the upper part of the hair when the furs are\r\nsheared, can be produced by applying a mixture similar to the above, to\r\nthe furs after they have received their base color by the dip process with\r\nnatural dyes or with the Oxidation Colors. Occasionally, the dyeing is\r\ngiven an after-treatment with a dilute solution of sodium bichromate to\r\nhelp develop the color, the action in this case being that of an oxidizing\r\nagent, and not of a mordant.\r\n\r\nAs far as the third method of mordanting is concerned, that of first\r\napplying the dye, and then the mordant, it is rarely practised with\r\nthe brush method. The procedure, however, consists in first brushing\r\non a solution of the desired dye, then drying and brushing on a mordant\r\nsolution. These operations are repeated perhaps two or three times until\r\nthe proper shade is obtained, exposing the furs to the air for the color\r\nto be developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. DYEING WITH VEGETABLE DYES BY THE DIP METHOD\r\n\r\nIt was in the application to furs by the dip process that the use of the\r\nvegetable dyes attained great importance, and although at the present\r\ntime, natural organic dyes have largely been superseded by the Oxidation\r\nColors and Aniline Black dyes, yet for certain purposes, and especially\r\nfor the production of blacks, the wood dyes still are able to hold their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of black formerly constituted probably the most important\r\nbranch of the fur dyeing industry, and was undoubtedly the most difficult\r\none. For it is possible to obtain as many different kinds of black\r\nas there are dyers of this color, but only a few certain shades are\r\ndesirable. The division of the classes of furs into those derived from\r\nthe various kinds of sheep, and those obtained from other animals is\r\nparticularly marked in the dyeing of black, and both the composition of\r\nthe dye formulas and the methods of dyeing are somewhat different for\r\nthe two groups. For the dyeing of black on Persian lambs, broadtails,\r\ncaraculs, etc., a combination of logwood and nutgalls with the requisite\r\nmordants is used, while on hares, Chinese sheep, foxes, raccoons, opossum,\r\netc., a mixture of logwood and turmeric or fustic, with the proper\r\nmordants is used.\r\n\r\nThe general procedure is as follows: The dye substances to be used are\r\nground up to a powder in a mill constructed for the purpose, after which\r\nthey are boiled with water in a copper-lined kettle or cauldron, heated\r\nfrom the outside by steam. The customary arrangement is to have a jacketed\r\nkettle, supported on a stand, and having taps and valves to enable the\r\nliquor to be drawn off, or pivoted, so that the kettle can be tilted,\r\nand the contents poured out. The use of the copper-lined vessel is to be\r\npreferred, as it is unaffected by any of the dye substances, and so cannot\r\ncause any rust stains. After the dyes have gone into solution and have\r\ncooled, the mordant chemicals, previously dissolved in water, are added,\r\nand the mixture stirred up. The dyeing in this instance is effected by the\r\nsimultaneous application of dye and mordant. The dye mixture is now run\r\noff, or poured out in the proper quantity into a number of small vats of\r\n25–30 gallon capacity, or into a paddle vat, which can be closed, while\r\nthe paddle is rotating. The latter device is to be preferred because it\r\npermits the dye to retain its temperature better and for a longer period\r\nof time, but when lambs are being dyed only the open vats are used. The\r\ntemperature of the dye mixture is between 40° and 45° C., for only at\r\nthis temperature can the hair absorb the dye properly without injuring the\r\nleather. The killed skins are immersed in the dyebath for a time, usually\r\novernight, after which they are removed, drained and hung up, with the\r\nhair-side exposed to the air, so as to permit the dye to develop, which\r\ntakes place with the aid of the atmospheric oxygen. The dyebath is again\r\nbrought to the proper temperature, and the skins are again entered, to go\r\nthrough the same process as often as is necessary to obtain the desired\r\ndepth of shade. The dyed skins are thoroughly washed to remove excess dye,\r\nthen dried and finished. The following are a few dye formulas used in the\r\nproduction of blacks:\r\n\r\n  Logwood extract       100 grams\r\n  Chestnut extract       14 c.c.\r\n  Turmeric               38 grams\r\n  Iron acetate 6° Bé.    50 c.c.\r\n  Water                1200 c.c.\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  Cutch                  15 grams\r\n  Soda                   14 grams\r\n  Logwood extract       120 grams\r\n  Verdigris              19 grams\r\n  Iron acetate 5° Bé.    16 c.c.\r\n  Water                1200 c.c.\r\n\r\nA recently published formula for dyeing China goat skins black, is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nDissolve 50 lbs. of dark turmeric and 45 lbs. of logwood extract and\r\nmake up to 300 gallons of solution, at 95° F. Enter the killed skins and\r\nleave them in the liquor until they rise to the surface. Then take them\r\nout and add 25 lbs. of logwood extract, 10 lbs. of sumach, 10 lbs. of\r\nblue vitriol, 5 lbs. of fustic extract, and about 60 lbs. of iron acetate\r\nliquor. Stir up well, and immerse the skins for 18 hours. Draw them up,\r\nand expose to the air for 12 hours. Heat the liquor again to 95° F. and\r\nput the skins back for 12 hours. Draw out, hang up in the air for a time,\r\nthen wash thoroughly, hydro-extract, dry and finish.\r\n\r\nIn a German patent, D. R. P. 107,717 (1898), is described a method for\r\ndyeing lambs black, consisting in treating the skins for 24 hours in a\r\nlogwood bath, then rinsing in cold water, and mordanting for 15 hours in\r\na solution of bichromate of potash. The skins are then washed and treated\r\nwith a solution of iron salt, then dried. This process, while of not much\r\npractical importance, is an illustration of mordanting subsequent to the\r\ndyeing treatment.\r\n\r\nAs far as the production of other shades is concerned, the procedure is\r\nquite similar to the regular black method. For a dark brown, for example,\r\nthe skins are dyed in a mixture containing\r\n\r\n  Gall-nuts                  40 parts\r\n  Verdigris                  10   „\r\n  Alum                       10   „\r\n  Copperas                    5   „\r\n  Brazilwood extract\r\n    (15° Twaddell)          150   „\r\n  Water                    1000   „\r\n\r\nemploying operations just as in the case of the black.\r\n\r\nGreyish-blue shades on white hares, lambs, kids, etc., can be obtained by\r\ntreating the skins successively in the following baths:\r\n\r\n  1. Logwood extract  100 grams\r\n     Water              1 liter\r\n  2. Indigotine        10 grams\r\n     Alum              10 grams\r\n     Water              1 liter\r\n\r\nBluish-grey tones on the same furs can be produced by treating with\r\n\r\n  1. Logwood extract  200 grams\r\n     Indigotine        15 grams\r\n     Water              1 liter\r\n  2. Alum             150 grams\r\n     Salammoniac       12 grams\r\n     Water              1 liter\r\n\r\nSimilar grey shades can be produced by mordanting the skins with an iron\r\nsalt, and then dyeing in a weak bath containing gall-nuts, sumach and iron\r\nvitriol. This method is very effective for making Alaska or silver fox\r\nimitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nANILINE BLACK\r\n\r\n\r\nFur seal for a long time has been a fur of distinction and importance in\r\nthe fur industry, and consequently the dyeing of seal has constituted an\r\nimportant, though not very extensive branch of the art of fur dyeing.\r\nIn quite recent times the popularity of seal has become so great that\r\nimitations have had to be produced to help supply the demand, and as a\r\nresult, French seal, or seal-dyed rabbit, and the so-called Hudson seal,\r\nwhich is seal-dyed muskrat, have acquired a great vogue. Occasionally\r\nopossum, nutria and other furs are also used for the purpose of producing\r\nseal imitations. While the supply of real seals is relatively small, and\r\nthe demand large, the production of seal imitations has assumed large\r\nproportions, and as a result, the dyeing of seal and its imitations or\r\nsubstitutes has come to be a great branch of the fur dyeing industry.\r\n\r\nDuring the past thirty years, the long and tedious processes of dyeing\r\nseal and seal imitations, involving the use of dyes of vegetable origin,\r\nhave largely been superseded by what is known as the Aniline Black dye.\r\nIt was the French who first worked out successfully the application of\r\nAniline Black to furs, and the method has attained much importance and\r\nextensive use in the fur dyeing industry.\r\n\r\nAniline Black is the name given to an insoluble black dyestuff produced\r\nby the oxidation of aniline in an acid medium. As a finished product it\r\ncannot be used in fur dyeing, but if the hair of the furs be impregnated\r\nwith a suitable preparation of aniline and then treated with certain\r\noxidizing agents, the color will be formed on the hair, being firmly\r\nfixed and giving a fast black, resistant to light, washing and rubbing.\r\nThe basis of the dye, aniline, is an oily liquid, possessing a peculiar\r\nfishy odor, colorless when pure, but rapidly turning brown when exposed to\r\nthe air. It is obtained from benzol, which is distilled from coal-tar, by\r\ntreating with nitric acid, forming nitrobenzol, which when subjected to\r\nthe action of reducing chemicals is converted into aniline. The process\r\nmay be shown schematically as follows:\r\n\r\nCoal--coal-tar--benzol--nitrobenzol--aniline oil--Aniline Black. Aniline\r\nBlack was by no means a new dye when the French succeeded in producing it\r\non furs. It had been used for a long time previous on textiles, chiefly\r\ncotton. The history of the development of the Aniline Black process\r\nthrows considerable light on its nature and constitution, and so presents\r\nmany features of interest. As early as 1834, the chemist Runge observed\r\nthe formation of a dark green color when heated aniline nitrate in the\r\npresence of cupric chloride. Fritsche, in 1840, noticed that when chromic\r\nacid was added to solutions of aniline salt, a dark green, and sometimes a\r\nblue-black precipitate was produced, and later the same chemist obtained\r\na deep blue by the action of potassium chlorate on aniline salt. It is\r\ninteresting to note that Perkin, in 1856, conducting similar experiments\r\non the oxidation of aniline with chromic acid, obtained a blue-black\r\nproduct from which he extracted the first synthetic coal-tar dye, mauve.\r\nThus far, all the experiments on the oxidation of aniline proved to be\r\nmerely of scientific interest, but in 1862, Lightfoot patented a process\r\nfor the practical application of colors formed by the oxidation of aniline\r\non the fibre, a greenish shade being obtained by that method, to which the\r\nname emeraldine was given, and by subsequent treatment with bichromate\r\nof potash, the green was changed to a deep blue color. Since that time,\r\nthe methods for producing and applying Aniline Black have been developed\r\nand improved, although all the processes were based on the principles\r\nincorporated in Lightfoot’s original patent. However, it was not until the\r\nlast decade of the nineteenth century that the dyeing of furs by means of\r\nthe Aniline Black method was successfully attempted.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the nature and the manner of the chemical changes which\r\ntake place in the production of Aniline Black is a valuable aid in\r\nobtaining satisfactory results in practise; and although Aniline Black\r\nwas extensively used before the true character of the reaction was\r\nunderstood, since the successful determination of the constitution of\r\nAniline Black and the discovery of the real nature of the process by\r\nGreen and his collaborators in 1913, the methods have been considerably\r\nimproved and simplified, with correspondingly better results in dyeing.\r\nAs a consequence, the methods of dyeing furs with Aniline Black have also\r\nbecome simpler and more efficient.\r\n\r\nA discussion of the chemical changes which occur in the Aniline Black\r\nprocess, is out of place here on account of the highly involved and\r\ncomplicated character of the reactions, to understand which requires a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of specialized organic chemistry. But the essential\r\nfeatures of practical importance in the production of Aniline Black are\r\nthe following: As already noted, one of the characteristic properties of\r\naniline is its tendency to turn from a colorless to a dark-brown liquid in\r\nthe presence of the air. This change is due, together with certain other\r\ncauses, to an oxidation brought about by atmospheric oxygen. By employing\r\noxidizing agents, this oxidation can be accelerated and carried further,\r\nand eventually the Aniline Black is obtained. Among the substances which\r\nmay be used to bring about the conversion of aniline to the insoluble\r\nblack dye are manganese dioxide, lead peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, chromic\r\nacid, ferric salts, potassium permanganate, chloric acid and chlorates\r\nin the presence of certain metallic salts, particularly those of vanadium\r\nand copper. Chlorates, especially sodium chlorate and potassium chlorate,\r\nare the most commonly employed oxidizing agents, bichromate of soda or\r\nof potash being used, in addition, to complete the oxidation. When using\r\nchlorates it is necessary to have present in the dye mixture a small\r\nquantity of a metallic salt, which, while not entering into the reaction\r\nitself, is nevertheless indispensable as an oxygen carrier. Vanadium\r\ncompounds have proved to be the most effective for this purpose, and\r\naccording to an authority, one part of vanadium salt is sufficient to\r\ncause the conversion of 270,000 parts of aniline to Aniline Black, the\r\nnecessary amount of a chlorate being present of course. Salts of copper,\r\ncerium, and iron are also extensively used, but they are not quite so\r\nefficient as vanadium.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Aniline Black in practise takes place in three\r\nwell-defined steps, which it is important to be able to recognize and\r\ndistinguish in order to obtain the best results. The first stage of the\r\noxidizing process produces what is called emeraldine, which in the acid\r\nmedium of the aniline bath is of a dark green, while in the free state it\r\nis of a blue color. As the oxidation proceeds, the second stage develops,\r\nthe emeraldine being converted to a compound called nigraniline. This in\r\nacid solution is blue, and the free base is a dark-blue, almost black.\r\nIt was formerly considered that the nigraniline was the Aniline Black\r\nproper, and so when this stage of the oxidation was reached, the process\r\nwas often interrupted and not carried to the limit. This can account for\r\nthe fact that Aniline Black dyeings usually turned green after a short\r\ntime. The reason for this is that nigraniline, when treated with weak\r\nreducing agents, as, for example, sulphurous acid, is at once changed\r\nto emeraldine, with its dark green color. Since there is usually a small\r\namount of sulphurous acid in the air, especially in places where coal or\r\ngas is burned, an Aniline Black dyeing which has not been carried beyond\r\nthe nigraniline stage will be reduced in time to the emeraldine, and cause\r\nthe dyeing to become green. The last step in the oxidation changes the\r\nnigraniline into what is properly called the ungreenable Aniline Black.\r\nWeak reducing substances like sulphurous acid do not change this compound\r\nto emeraldine, and stronger reducing agents only convert it to a brownish\r\ncompound, which changes back to the black when exposed to the air. It is\r\nquite evident that in order to obtain a black which will not change to\r\ngreen in time, the oxidation of the aniline must be carried to the last\r\nstage. By making tests during the dyeing of the furs, it can easily be\r\ndetermined whether the oxidation has proceeded far enough.\r\n\r\nIn the dyeing of textiles with Aniline Black, it is customary to carry\r\nout the operation at comparatively high temperatures, approaching 100°\r\ncentigrade. With furs such temperatures are out of the question, so it is\r\nnecessary to repeat the dyeing several times in order to obtain the proper\r\ndepth of shade working in the cold. Only the brush method can be used in\r\napplying the Aniline Black dye to furs, on account of the strong acidity\r\nof the dye mixture, which would ruin the leather, if the dyeing were done\r\nin a bath. Indeed, great care must be exercised even by the brush method\r\nto avoid too great penetration of the dye liquid, otherwise the roots\r\nof the hair will be attacked, and the leather may be “burned” from the\r\nhair side. Furs dyed with Aniline Black are frequently after-dyed by the\r\ndip-process with logwood or some other similar dye, in order to add to\r\nthe brilliancy of the dyeing. Combined with intensity of color, Aniline\r\nBlack on furs is the only dye which will also give fast, lustrous shades,\r\nand leave the hair soft and smooth.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of applying Aniline Black on furs, the most\r\nimportant being\r\n\r\n  1. One-bath Aniline Black\r\n  2. Oxidation Aniline Black\r\n  3. Diphenyl Black\r\n  4. Aniline Black by Green’s Process\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _One-bath Aniline Black_\r\n\r\nA typical formula for this method is the following given by Beltzer:\r\n\r\n  Aniline salt            10 kg.\r\n  Sodium chlorate        1.5 kg.\r\n  Copper sulphate        0.7 kg.\r\n  Vanadate of ammonia     10 gr.\r\n\r\nAll these substances are dissolved hot in 50 liters of water, and allowed\r\nto cool, forming solution A. Aniline salt is aniline oil which has been\r\nneutralized with the exact quantity of hydrochloric acid to form the\r\nhydrochloride. It forms white or greyish crystalline lumps very easily\r\nsoluble in water. The sodium chlorate is the oxidizing agent, and the\r\ncopper sulphate and the vanadate of ammonia are the oxygen carriers.\r\n\r\n15 kg. of sodium bichromate are also dissolved in 50 liters of water,\r\nforming solution B. The bichromate is also an oxidizing agent and serves\r\nto complete the oxidation of the aniline to the black.\r\n\r\nImmediately before using, solutions A and B are mixed together, both being\r\ncool. In general practise it is customary to mix only small quantities\r\nat a time, as a considerable precipitate forms when the whole batch\r\nis mixed at once, the precipitate being so much waste dye substance.\r\nUsually a liter of A and a liter of B are mixed at a time, and the furs\r\nbrushed with the mixture. The brushing must be varied according as the\r\nhair is hard and stiff, or soft and tender. The hair must be thoroughly\r\nimpregnated in all directions, and the penetration must not be too deep\r\nto affect the leather. With experience and dexterity satisfactory results\r\ncan easily be achieved. After the skins have been properly treated, they\r\nare dried at a temperature of about 35 degrees centigrade. When dry, they\r\nare returned to the dye bench, where they receive another application\r\nof the dye mixture, and are again dried. This operation may be repeated\r\nas often as six or seven times before a sufficiently intense black is\r\nobtained. Another way of producing the desired depth of shade with fewer\r\napplications is by using more concentrated dye mixtures. Each method\r\nhas its disadvantages, the greater number of brushings requiring the\r\nexpenditure of more time and labor, and the greater concentration of\r\nthe bath resulting in a considerable loss of dye substance due to the\r\nformation of a large precipitate when the two solutions are mixed, and\r\nmoreover, not all furs can be treated with concentrated mixtures. The best\r\nresults with this method usually require the application of six coats of\r\na mixture of moderate concentration.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Oxidation Aniline Black_\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the difficulty of employing very concentrated dye\r\nmixtures, or of making many applications of the dye, a method was devised\r\nwhereby the two solutions of the previous process, instead of being mixed\r\ntogether, are applied successively to the hair of the furs, the following\r\nformula, also by Beltzer, being an example:\r\n\r\n  Aniline oil                     10 liters\r\n  Nitric acid 36° Beaumé, or\r\n  Hydrochloric acid 22° Beaumé    20 liters\r\n  Cold water                      20 liters\r\n\r\nThis is solution A, and is merely a solution of aniline hydrochloride,\r\nor nitrate, depending on which acid has been used. Nitric acid, although\r\nmore costly than the hydrochloric acid, is to be preferred, because it\r\nis an oxidizing acid, and so assists in the oxidation of the aniline, and\r\nbesides, has a more beneficial effect on the hair than the hydrochloric,\r\nin the matter of softness and luster.\r\n\r\n  Sodium chlorate          4 kg.\r\n  Copper sulphate          1 kg.\r\n  Vanadate of ammonia     10 gr.\r\n  Water                   50 liters\r\n\r\nThis is solution B, containing the oxidizing agent, and the oxygen\r\ncarriers. Just before using, equal quantities of A and B are mixed, and\r\nthe skins brushed with the mixture. The skins are then dried at 35–45°\r\ncentigrade, at which temperature the color begins to develop. When almost,\r\nbut not entirely dried, the skins are subjected to the action of warm\r\nvapor, which is allowed to enter the drying chamber, so as to keep the\r\ntemperature about 40° centigrade, the color developing better in this\r\nway. This operation may be repeated, or the skins are directly treated\r\nwith a solution of 25 kg. of sodium bichromate in 100 liters of water,\r\nto complete the oxidation. The moist skins are exposed to the air for a\r\ntime, and then dried at 35° C.\r\n\r\nThis method of dyeing has several advantages over the One-bath Aniline\r\nBlack. It requires fewer brushings, and enables the complete utilization\r\nof the dye solutions without loss. With three applications of the dye\r\nmixture by the Oxidation process, as deep and intense a black can be\r\nobtained as with six brushings by the One-bath method. The dyeings, too,\r\nare nearly, but not fully as brilliant and even as in the latter case.\r\nThe greater the number of coats of dye that are applied the more regular\r\nwill the dyeing be.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Diphenyl Black_\r\n\r\nIn 1902, the Farbwerke Hoechst, a large German producer of coal tar\r\nintermediates and dyes, invented an Aniline Black process to which they\r\ngave the name Diphenyl Black. The chief departure from the previous\r\nAniline Black methods was the replacing of part of the aniline oil of the\r\ndye mixture by Diphenyl Black Base I, which is para-aminodiphenylamine.\r\nThis base has the property of being oxidized to Aniline Black, just like\r\naniline oil, and the advantage claimed for the Diphenyl Black is that it\r\nproduces an absolutely ungreenable black. The method of application is\r\npractically the same as for the other Aniline Black processes, chlorates\r\nbeing used as the oxidizing agents, in the presence of oxygen carriers\r\nsuch as salts of copper and vanadium. The use of bichromates is dispensed\r\nwith. On account of the comparatively high cost of the Diphenyl Black\r\nBase I, this method has not found very extensive application, especially\r\nas highly satisfactory ungreenable blacks can now be produced by other\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Aniline Black by Green’s Process_\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Green, who has done much work in the direction of elucidating the\r\ncharacter of the Aniline Black process, obtained a patent for a method\r\nof applying Aniline Black in a manner which was different from all the\r\npreviously known formulas. The invention created great interest, and\r\nalthough in its original form it did not find a wide application, many of\r\nthe methods used at the present time are in one way or another derived\r\nfrom the idea of Green. A resumé of the patent will therefore be given\r\nhere: “The invention relates to the production of an Aniline Black, the\r\nnew process differing from all other known processes by the fact that\r\nthe oxidation of aniline is effected solely or mainly by the oxygen of\r\nair. The possibility of dispensing with an oxidizing agent depends on the\r\ndiscovery that the addition of a small quantity of a para-diamine, or of\r\na para-amido-phenol to a mixture containing aniline and a suitable oxygen\r\ncarrier, such as a salt of copper, greatly accelerates the oxidation of\r\nthe aniline by the atmospheric oxygen. Further, whereas in the ordinary\r\nprocesses of Aniline Black, the quantity of mineral acid employed cannot\r\nbe materially reduced below the proportion of one equivalent to one\r\nequivalent of the base, under the new conditions the mineral acid may\r\nbe wholly or partially replaced by an organic acid such as formic acid,\r\nwithout the quality of the black being materially affected. As suitable\r\noxygen carriers the chlorides of copper have been found to give the best\r\nresults, it being preferrable to use the copper in the form of a cuprous\r\nsalt. This is effected by adding to the dye mixture cupric chloride,\r\ntogether with a sulphite or bisulphite in sufficient quantity to reduce\r\nthe cupric salt to the cuprous state, and a sufficient quantity of a\r\nsoluble chloride to keep the cuprous chloride in solution. Among the\r\ncompounds suitable for the production of this black in conjunction with\r\naniline are, para-phenylene-diamine, dimethyl-para-phenylene-diamine,\r\npara-amido-diphenylamine, para-amido-phenol, etc.”\r\n\r\nThis method may be used alone as the other Aniline Blacks, or the dyed\r\nskins may be after-dyed in a bath containing a logwood dye, or it may be\r\nused in conjunction with mineral dyes, or with the Oxidation Colors (see\r\nnext chapter). A typical formula for the black by Green’s process is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Para-amido-phenol            0.5 kg.\r\n  Aniline oil                   10 liters\r\n  Hydrochloric acid 22° Bé.     10 liters\r\n  Acetic acid 40%                5 liters\r\n  Cold water                    25 liters\r\n\r\nThis is solution A. Solution B is prepared by dissolving\r\n\r\n  Copper sulphate       2 kg.\r\n  Salammoniac          10 kg.\r\n  Cold water           50 liters\r\n\r\nA and B are mixed, and the mixture applied to the hair of the furs several\r\ntimes, drying each time at 35°–40° C. After three coats of dye have\r\nbeen applied, a pretty and fairly intense black shade is obtained, which\r\nis developed further by treating with a solution of 25 grams of sodium\r\nbichromate per liter of water. The skins are then allowed to dry in air,\r\nand then if desired, an after-dyeing is made with some other dye.\r\n\r\nOn account of its extreme fastness, Aniline Black, produced by any of\r\nthe methods outlined above, has attained a justifiable popularity for\r\nthe dyeing of furs, in spite of the necessity of using the more or less\r\ncumbersome brush method of applying the dye. Very recently there was\r\nissued to a German company a patent in which is described a method whereby\r\nfurs can be dyed with Aniline Black by the dip process. An abstract of\r\nthe patent (D. R. P. 33402) is as follows: “As is known, aniline salt,\r\nand similar salts, together with oxidizing agents like bichromates,\r\nchlorates, etc., cannot be used for dyeing furs by the dip process,\r\nbecause the strongly dissociated mineral acid is injurious to the leather.\r\nThe dissociation of the acid can be reduced by adding neutral salts, like\r\ncommon salt, or Glauber’s salt, so that good results can be obtained by\r\ndyeing in a bath of the dye mixture, the leather retaining its softness.”\r\n\r\nThus far there have been no reports of the successful practical\r\napplication of this patent, so its value cannot be discussed. It is\r\nextremely doubtful, however, that furs will ever be dyed in the dyebath\r\nwith the present type of Aniline Black formulas, no matter what substances\r\nare added to prevent the leather from being affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nOXIDATION COLORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1888 may be considered the beginning of a new era in the\r\nhistory of fur dyeing; the commencement of a period which was to see\r\nthe time-honored, traditional methods of the masters of the art give way\r\nto newer methods of an entirely different character; and moreover, the\r\ninitiation of an age when science with its basis of fact and logic, was\r\nto undertake the rationalization of an industry which had hitherto worked\r\nupon a more or less irrational, empirical and uncertain comprehension\r\nof the fundamental principles involved. It was not the work of a single\r\nday, or even of a year which brought about the virtual revolution in the\r\ndyeing of furs, but the result of long, patient, systematic effort. About\r\nthis time, the German coal tar industry was attaining its real stride\r\nalong the path of progress and achievement, and had already succeeded in\r\nreaching, to an appreciable degree at any rate, most users of coloring\r\nmatters, with the consequence that the natural dyes, with their time and\r\nlabor-consuming processes of application were gradually being superseded\r\nby the new synthetic dyestuffs which could be simply and quickly applied.\r\nIt was now the turn of the fur dyeing industry to receive the attention of\r\nthe scientists and technologists responsible for the growth of the coal\r\ntar dye industry, and so there appeared in the above-mentioned year, the\r\nfollowing patents, taken out by a German chemist named Erdmann:\r\n\r\n\r\nD. R. P. 47349\r\n\r\nA Process for Dyeing Hair and Feathers\r\n\r\nIf white hair or feathers are soaked in an aqueous or alcoholic solution\r\nof para-phenylene-diamine, and then exposed to the slow oxidation of\r\nthe air, or are treated in a second solution with some oxidizing agent,\r\nthen the hair or feathers will be dyed. According to the oxidizing agent\r\nchosen, and the concentration of the solution used, the color obtained\r\nwill be light or dark, varying from the palest blond to the deepest\r\nblue-black. Particularly suitable as oxidizing substances are ferric\r\nchloride, permanganates, chlorates, hypochlorites, bichromates, and\r\nhydrogen peroxide. The dyeings are fast, that is, they do not come off,\r\nand the color cannot be removed by washing. Following examples may serve\r\nto make the process clear:\r\n\r\n20 grams pure para-phenylene-diamine and 14 grams caustic soda are\r\ndissolved in a liter of water. The hair, previously degreased, is soaked\r\nthoroughly in this solution, and while moist is entered into a three per\r\ncent solution of peroxide of hydrogen. The action is not instantaneous,\r\nbut after a day, the hair is dyed a dark shade; by repetition of these\r\noperations a blue-black is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe para-phenylene-diamine can be replaced in this process by other\r\nsimilar bases, such as dimethyl-para-phenylene-diamine, as well as the\r\nnaphthylene-diamines. Since the substances which can be applied by this\r\nprocess are uninjurious, the method described can be used to dye human\r\nhair on the head or beard, and so seems suited to replace for the dyeing\r\nof hair, the metallic salts and various pyrogallic solutions which are on\r\nthe market, and which are harmful to the health.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. R. P. 51073 Supplement to 47349; Process for Dyeing Hair\r\n\r\nThis patent was an extension of the original patent to include certain oxy\r\nand amido-oxy compounds, the method being essentially the same otherwise\r\nas in the original patent. An illustration of the process is as follows:\r\n\r\n73 grams para-amido phenol hydrochloride are dissolved with 40 grams\r\ncaustic soda in a liter of water. The solution dyes hair a golden-yellow,\r\nwhich on subsequent treatment with a solution of ferric chloride turns to\r\na red-brown.\r\n\r\nIn these two patents is to be found the basis of the modern fur dyes\r\nand fur dyeing methods. It is interesting to note that furs were not\r\nmentioned at all in connection with the process, which was intended\r\nmainly for dyeing hair, especially on the human head. It was only several\r\nyears later that the value of the method for dyeing furs was realized.\r\nSo about 1894, the Aktien Gesellschaft für Anilinfabrikation put upon\r\nthe market three fur dyes under the trade name Ursol, Ursol D, giving\r\ndark-brown to black shades; Ursol P, giving red-brown colors; and Ursol\r\nC, giving a yellowish-brown shade. Pyrogallic acid had been previously\r\nused as a hair dye, and also to a slight extent as a fur dye, so it was\r\nused in conjunction with the Ursol dyes for shading purposes. The new fur\r\ndyes were not dyes in the ordinarily accepted sense of the term. They\r\nwere really coal-tar intermediates, substances similar in character to\r\naniline, and their dyeing property depended on the fact that they could\r\nbe oxidized either by atmospheric oxygen, or by means of oxidizing agents,\r\nforming colored insoluble products. When the oxidation of the intermediate\r\nwas caused to take place on the hair the colored product formed on and\r\nin the hair fibre, and remained fast. The reactions bringing about the\r\nconversion of the intermediate to the colored insoluble compound are quite\r\nanalogous to those of the Aniline Black process, though possibly not so\r\ncomplicated, with the important difference, however, that, while in the\r\nproduction of Aniline Black acid is essential, in the present instance the\r\noxidation can be carried on in neutral or even alkaline medium. On account\r\nof the character of the method used in applying the new fur dyes, the\r\nname Oxidation Colors has been given to them. Strictly speaking, Aniline\r\nBlack is also an Oxidation dye, but it is usually considered in a class\r\nby itself. The methods used at first in the application of the Ursol dyes\r\nto furs followed closely the process as described in the patents. The furs\r\nwere first killed, usually by brushing on a lime mixture, drying, and then\r\nbeating out the dust. This operation was repeated, if necessary. Then a\r\nsolution of the desired dye, mixed with an equal volume of 3% peroxide of\r\nhydrogen was brushed on and the fur allowed to lie exposed to the air. The\r\ndyeing could also be done by the dip process, less concentrated solutions\r\nbeing used. By varying the concentration of the solution, and prolonging\r\nor shortening the time of action, the shades could be varied from very\r\nlight to very dark, and by combining two or more of the Oxidation Colors,\r\nmany different color effects could be produced. Soon other fur dyes were\r\ndeveloped and put on the market; for example, Ursol DB, giving blue to\r\nblue-black shades, and Ursol 2G, yielding yellowish tones suitable for\r\nmixing with the other colors. Ursol C was discarded shortly after its\r\nintroduction. The dyeings obtained with the Oxidation Colors seemed to be\r\nvery fast, resisting successfully the action of cold or hot water, or even\r\nhot soap solution. Moreover, a dyed hair examined under the microscope\r\nappeared to be colored through the epidermis to the medulla, and no\r\nindividual particles of dye could be discerned.\r\n\r\nThe new fur dyes had many evident advantages over the coloring matters\r\nin general use at the time. The simplicity of the dyeing operations,\r\nthe short duration of the process, the great tinctorial power of the\r\nnew products, were facts which strongly recommended themselves to the\r\nprogressive fur dyer. The cost of the dyes was higher than that of the\r\nvegetable dyes, but this consideration was largely overbalanced by the\r\nsaving in time and labor in using them. And yet, the Ursol dyes found\r\nonly a comparatively small market. The majority of fur dyers, always\r\nconservative and reluctant to turn from the traditional ways of the\r\nindustry were skeptical of, and even hostile towards the new dyes and\r\nthe new methods of dyeing. In a sense, this opposition was justifiable.\r\nIt was not an easy task to relinquish all at once methods which had\r\nbeen successfully applied for generations back, and with which they\r\nwere thoroughly experienced, in favor of processes which were radically\r\ndifferent, and with which they had no experience at all. But some\r\nenterprising spirits among the fur dyers undertook to try out the new\r\nproducts and it was not long before the skeptics had good cause for\r\ncondemning the work and achievements of the chemists as far as fur dyeing\r\nwas concerned. The new type of dyes did possess some of the advantages\r\nclaimed for them, but they also possessed many highly objectionable\r\nfeatures, which had never been manifest with the vegetable dyes. First\r\nof all, the dyeings were not so fast as had at first appeared, for the\r\ncolor came off the hair when the furs were rubbed, brushed or beaten.\r\nThen it was observed that after a short time some of the dyeings changed\r\ncolor, and at the same time the hair lost its gloss and became brittle.\r\nThe condition of the leather after dyeing was anything but satisfactory.\r\nMost serious of all, however, was the appearance among the workers in\r\nthe dyeing establishments, and also among the furriers who worked with\r\nthe dyed skins, of certain pathological conditions which had hitherto\r\nbeen unknown. Various skin diseases, eczemas, inflammation of the\r\neyes, asthmatic affections and intestinal irritations were some of the\r\nafflictions which were directly attributable to the use of fur dyes of\r\nthe Ursol type. Medical science was at a loss to know how to treat these\r\nailments, because their nature was not understood.\r\n\r\nHere indeed, were obstacles threatening to destroy all the hopes which\r\nthe discovery of the new class of dyes had aroused, and to check at the\r\noutset the possibility of rational progress in the fur dyeing industry.\r\nBut the men of science were not content to let the matter drop thus.\r\nDifficult problems had been solved before, and surely there must be\r\nsome way of overcoming the objections and deleterious features of a\r\nsystem of fur dyeing which had so much potential merit. Where hindrances\r\nsprang up in the path of progress, it was the duty of the chemist to\r\nremove them, and when difficulties arose, it was up to him to resolve\r\nthem, as far as was humanly possible. So the chemists who had been\r\nresponsible for the introduction of the Oxidation Colors set themselves\r\nto the task of eliminating the undesirable or injurious qualities. It\r\nwas many years before the results of painstaking effort and persistent\r\nstudy cleared up the causes of all the objectionable aspects of the fur\r\ndyes, and suggested means of overcoming them satisfactorily. The work\r\nhad been directed to the improvement of the dyes and of the methods of\r\ndyeing with them. Purer intermediates were produced, and more easily\r\nsoluble ones, so that there would be no possibility of ultra-microscopic\r\nparticles of the dye being deposited on the surface of the hair from the\r\ndye solution, instead of being taken up within the hair fibre. It was\r\nthis superficial deposition of minute crystals of the dye or of the only\r\npartially oxidized intermediate, on the hair, crystals so fine as to be\r\ninvisible in the ordinary high-power microscope, which caused the color\r\nto come off when the furs were brushed or beaten, giving rise to a dust\r\nwhich was frequently very injurious to the health. Then, mordants were\r\nadopted to help fix the dyes, compounds of copper, iron, and chromium\r\nbeing used as formerly with the vegetable dyes, and the range of shades\r\nwas also increased thereby. Certain of the Oxidation Colors had a tendency\r\nto sublime off the hair, so the dyed hair was chemically after-treated\r\nin such cases to prevent this. The causes of the pathological aspects of\r\ndyeing with the Oxidation fur dyes were not so readily disposed of. But\r\nthe adoption of devices to prevent the formation and circulation of dust\r\nduring the handling of the dye, the employment of adequate protection\r\nagainst contact with the dye or its solutions, the use of the most dilute\r\nsolutions possible in dyeing, the thorough washing of the dyed skins to\r\nremove any excess of the coloring matter, the prevention of dust formation\r\nin the drying of the skins, and the rigid observance of, and adherence to\r\nhygienic laws, were all factors in the elimination of the health-impairing\r\nphases of dyeing with the Oxidation Colors.\r\n\r\nIt was only after all these improvements had been accomplished that the\r\nfur dye intermediates began to acquire a degree of popularity among fur\r\ndyers, and strange as it may seem, there was a more ready market for\r\nthese dyes in America, than in Germany where they were manufactured. Other\r\nmanufacturers of coal-tar intermediates also began to produce fur dyes,\r\nand so, in addition to the Ursols, there were the Nako brand, the Furrol\r\nbrand, the Furrein brand, and one or two others. New dyes were invented,\r\nuntil the whole range of colors suitable for fur dyeing had been produced.\r\nThe black dye, however, presented some difficulty. A black dye which would\r\nrival logwood blacks could not be attained. Ursol DB in conjunction with\r\nUrsol D was being used to produce bluish-blacks, but the dyeings were not\r\nfast, turning reddish after a time. In 1909, a patent was taken out for\r\na dye mixture, which was made up like the DB brand, but instead of using\r\ntoluylene diamine with para-phenylene-diamine, the new dye was made up of\r\na methoxy, or ethoxy-diamine with para-phenylene-diamine, and it yielded\r\nbrilliant bluish-blacks, which were fast, and which very nearly approached\r\nthe logwood black in luster, intensity, and bloom. For some purposes,\r\nhowever, the production of a black color is still dependent on the use of\r\nthe logwood dye.\r\n\r\nWhen the Great War cut off to a large degree the importation of skins\r\ndyed in Europe, the American fur dyeing industry developed tremendously,\r\nand in a comparatively short time was able satisfactorily to accomplish\r\nin the way of dyeing furs, what had taken foreign dyers a much longer\r\nperiod to attain. It had been previously considered that furs could be\r\ndyed properly only by European fur dyers, but the achievements in this\r\ndirection by Americans fully dispelled this belief. But the success of\r\nthe fur dyers in America might not have been so marked or rapid, had it\r\nnot been for the work of the American chemists. The war had also shut off\r\nthe supply of German dyes, upon which the dyeing industries of America\r\nhad formerly been dependent, so enterprising chemists in this country\r\nundertook to fill the need, and in a surprisingly short time, American fur\r\ndyes, in every respect the equal of the foreign product were offered to\r\nthe American fur dyers, and at the present time, the requirements of the\r\nfur dyeing industry in this country are being adequately met by domestic\r\nproducers. Among the brands on the market are the Rodol, Furamine,\r\nFurol, and several others. The Oxidation Colors are now being offered\r\nin a high state of purity, and easily soluble, free from any poisonous\r\nconstituents, and there is absolutely no reason for the appearance of\r\nany pathological conditions among workers on dyed furs, or users of such\r\nfurs, provided the necessary precautions have been taken in the dyeing\r\nprocess. The occurrence of any affection which can be traced to dyed fur,\r\ncannot possibly be due to the dye itself, but to gross carelessness and\r\nnegligence in dyeing, and in any such event, the dyer responsible should\r\nbe brought to account.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a better understanding of the nature and action of the\r\nOxidation Colors, a typical one will be studied in some detail. The most\r\nimportant one in this class is para-phenylene-diamine, usually designated\r\nby the letter D in all commercial brands of this fur dye, while its\r\nchemical formula is represented as C₆H₄(NH₂)₂. When pure it occurs in\r\ncolorless, crystalline lumps, which rapidly turn brown when exposed to\r\nthe air; the technical product of commerce is of a dark-brown color.\r\nIt dissolves readily in hot water when pure, and also in acids. At one\r\ntime the hydrochloride was used instead of the free base, on account\r\nof its greater solubility, but now a base is made which is sufficiently\r\npure to be very soluble in water. There are several methods of preparing\r\npara-phenylene-diamine: first, by the reduction of amido-azobenzol,\r\nthe product obtained in this way always containing a slight amount of\r\naniline, which reduces the solubility, and also gives rise to poisonous\r\noxidation products during the dyeing process; second, by the reduction\r\nof paranitraniline, the quality and solubility of the product in this\r\ncase depending on the purity of the starting material; and third, by the\r\ntreatment of para-dichloro-benzol with ammonia under pressure, the best\r\nproduct being obtained by this method. The crude para-phenylene-diamine,\r\nmade by any of the above processes, is generally distilled in vacuo, the\r\nrefined base being obtained as lumps with a crystalline fracture.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the oxidation of the para-phenylene-diamine is the\r\nformation of quinone di-imine, NH:C₆H₄:NH. This is a very unstable\r\ncompound in the free state, and even in aqueous solution it decomposes\r\nwithin a comparatively short time, or combines with itself to form a more\r\nstable substance. Quinone di-imine has a very sharp, penetrating odor, and\r\nproduces violent local irritations wherever it comes in contact with the\r\nmucous membrane. If a small quantity of para-phenylene-diamine is absorbed\r\ninto the human body, by breathing the dust, or otherwise, the formation\r\nof quinone di-imine takes place internally with consequent irritation of\r\nthe mucous lining throughout the body. The various pathological conditions\r\nmentioned before may be ascribed to irritation caused by quinone\r\ndi-imine. In any dyeing process where there is a possibility of the\r\nformation of quinone di-imine, as is the case with most dyes containing\r\npara-phenylene-diamine, special precautions must be taken by the workers\r\nin handling the dye or coming in contact with its solutions, and no one\r\nwho is particularly sensitive to irritation should be permitted to work\r\nin a place where such dyes are used.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the oxidation of the para-phenylene-diamine is the\r\nformation of what is called Bandrowski’s base. Three parts of the quinone\r\ndi-imine combine with themselves, forming a substance of a brown-black\r\ncolor, which was formerly regarded as the final oxidation product. The\r\nformula of Bandrowski’s base is represented by the following chemical\r\nhieroglyphics:\r\n\r\n  (NH₂)₂.C₆H₃.N:C₆H₄:N.C₆H₃(NH₂)₂.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation has shown that the oxidation proceeds beyond this\r\nstage with the formation of a compound of what is known as the azine type,\r\nwhich is depicted by the chemist as\r\n\r\n             NH      NH\r\n  (NH₂).C₆H₃<  >C₆H₂<  >C₆H₃.NH₂.\r\n             NH      NH\r\n\r\nIt is by no means certain that this substance is the true coloring matter\r\nobtained by the oxidation of para-phenylene-diamine, for the reactions\r\nmay continue still farther, producing even more complicated oxidation\r\nproducts. Scientific research and study has not as yet gone beyond this\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of the other dyes of the Oxidation type are quite similar to\r\nthose of para-phenylene-diamine, some being simpler, and others being even\r\nmore complex. The presence of certain chemical groups in the intermediate,\r\nor the relative position of such groups are factors responsible for the\r\nvariations in shade.\r\n\r\nWith the various mordants, the Oxidation Colors give different shades, and\r\na great range of colors can be produced either by combining mordants, or\r\ncombining dyes, or both. The following tables illustrate the shades formed\r\nwith the customary mordants.\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n           |    CHROME     |     COPPER     |     IRON     |    DIRECT\r\n  ---------+---------------+----------------+--------------+---------------\r\n  Ursol D  | brown black   | coal black     | coal black   | dark brown to\r\n           |               |                |              |   brown black\r\n  Ursol P  | dull red brown| dull dark brown| grey brown   | light brown\r\n  Ursol 2G | yellow brown  | dull yellow    | yellow brown | dull yellow\r\n           |               |   brown        |              |\r\n  Ursol A  |    ...        |     ...        | blue black   | blue to blue-\r\n           |               |                |              |   black\r\n  Ursol 4G | light brown   | medium brown   | yellow       | pure yellow\r\n  Ursol 4R | orange brown  | light yellow   | red brown    | orange red\r\n           |               |   brown        |              |\r\n  Ursol    |               |                |              |\r\n    Grey B | greenish grey | greenish grey  | mouse grey   |     ...\r\n  Ursol    |               |                |              |\r\n    Grey R | brownish grey | brownish grey  | reddish grey |     ...\r\n  ---------+---------------+----------------+--------------+---------------\r\n\r\nFur dyes of American make being equal in every way to the German product,\r\nshow the same color reactions with the various mordants. The following\r\ntable shows the shades produced with the same mordants as above:\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n           |    CHROME     |    COPPER     |     IRON      |     DIRECT\r\n  ---------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n  Rodol D  | brown black   | coal black    | coal black    | brownish black\r\n  Rodol P  | red brown     | dark brown    | grey brown    | light brown\r\n  Rodol 2G | yellow brown  | yellow brown  | yellow brown  | dull yellow\r\n  Rodol 4G | light brown   | light brown   | reddish brown | pure yellow\r\n  Rodol A  |     ...       | blue black    |     ...       | blue black\r\n  Rodol    |               |               |               |\r\n    Grey B | greenish grey | greenish grey | mouse grey    |     ...\r\n  Rodol    |               |               |               |\r\n    Grey R | greenish grey | brownish grey | mouse grey    |     ...\r\n  ---------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------\r\n\r\nAll these shades are produced by dyeing in a bath containing a _neutral_\r\nsolution of the dye. Sometimes the dye comes in the form of a salt of\r\na mineral acid, like hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, in which case a\r\nsufficient amount of an alkali, usually ammonia, is added to liberate\r\nthe free base. According to the Cassella Co., German manufacturers of the\r\nFurrol brand of fur dyes, the dyeing can also be carried on in slightly\r\nalkaline or in slightly acid solution, a different series of shades being\r\nobtained in each instance. Ammonia is used to render the bath alkaline,\r\nand formic acid to make it acid. The most customary practise, however, is\r\nto use neutral solutions of the dyes.\r\n\r\nFor preparing the mordant solutions much smaller quantities of the\r\nmetallic compounds are used than in the case of the vegetable dyes. With\r\nchrome mordants cream of tartar is always employed as an assistant, and\r\noccasionally also with copper and with iron mordants. With copper, and\r\nalso with iron mordants no addition is made at all, or sometimes a small\r\nquantity of acetic acid is added. The temperature of the mordant solution\r\nis kept about 30° C., and the duration of the mordanting varies from 2–24\r\nhours according to the depth of shade desired. The concentration of the\r\nsolution may also be varied, it sometimes being just as well to use a\r\nstrong mordant solution and less duration of mordanting. Chrome may be\r\ncombined with copper, and iron may be combined with copper, but chrome\r\nand iron do not go together as mordants. Some typical average mordanting\r\nformulas are as follows:\r\n\r\n         Chrome mordant.\r\n  Bichromate of soda    2.5 gms.\r\n  Cream of tartar       1.5 gms.\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\n         Copper mordant.\r\n  Copper sulphate         2 gms.\r\n  (Acetic acid 50%        2 gms.)\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\n          Iron mordant.\r\n  Ferrous sulphate        2 gms.\r\n  (Acetic acid 50%        2 gms.)\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  Iron pyrolignite 30%   10 gms.\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\n      Chrome-copper mordant.\r\n  Bichromate of soda      2 gms.\r\n  Copper sulphate      0.25 gms.\r\n  Cream of tartar       1.0 gms.\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\n       Copper-iron mordant.\r\n  Copper sulphate         2 gms.\r\n  Ferrous sulphate        2 gms.\r\n  (Acetic acid 50%        2 gms.)\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nThe killed skins are immersed in the mordanting solution, and allowed\r\nto remain the required length of time. They are then thoroughly rinsed\r\nto remove any excess of the mordant, and are hydro-extracted. Under no\r\ncircumstances should mordanted skins be permitted to dry, for they would\r\nbe unfit for use again.\r\n\r\nThe dyebath is next prepared by dissolving the necessary quantity of the\r\ndye, varying from 0.1 gm. to 10 gms. per liter. Then if the solution must\r\nbe neutralized, the ammonia is added and the temperature of the bath is\r\nbrought to 30–35° C. by the addition of cold water. This temperature is\r\nmaintained throughout the dyeing operation. To the solution is added the\r\noxidizing agent. Ordinary commercial peroxide of hydrogen containing 3%\r\nby weight is the usual oxidizer, although perborates have been suggested.\r\n15–20 parts of peroxide of hydrogen for every part of dye are added, and\r\nthe dye solution brought to the proper dilution. As soon as the dyebath is\r\nready, the skins are entered, and worked for a short time to effect even\r\npenetration. They are then left in the dyebath for 2–12 hours or longer\r\naccording to the depth of shade. After being satisfactorily dyed, the furs\r\nare rinsed thoroughly, hydro-extracted and dried and finished. Where the\r\ndye is to be applied by the brush to the tips of the hair, stronger dye\r\nsolutions are used, the brushed skins being placed hair together and let\r\nlie for about 6 hours in order to permit the color to develop, after which\r\nthe furs are dried and drum-cleaned.\r\n\r\nSome shades, particularly black, have a tendency to rub off slightly. In\r\norder to overcome this, the dyed furs, after rinsing, are treated with a\r\ncold solution of 1/2 part of copper sulphate per 1000 parts of water, for\r\n3–4 hours, then without rinsing, hydro-extracted and dried. Furs which\r\nhave been tipped are brushed with a 1–2% solution of copper sulphate and\r\ndried. Care must be taken in this after-treatment, for the use of too\r\nstrong a solution of copper sulphate, or too prolonged action of such a\r\nsolution will materially alter the shade of the dyed fur.\r\n\r\nA few typical formulas will serve to illustrate the general methods of\r\nemploying the Oxidation Colors:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brown Sable Imitation on Unsheared Rabbit_\r\n\r\nThe skins are killed with soda, soured, and washed, then mordanted with\r\n\r\n  Bichromate of soda      2 grams\r\n  Copper sulphate       .25 grams\r\n  Cream of tartar         1 gram\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nfor 24 hours. Then washed, and dyed for 24 hours with\r\n\r\n  Fur Brown 2G[3]         3 grams\r\n  Hydrogen peroxide      45 grams\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nWash and dry the skins, then brush the tips with\r\n\r\n  Fur Brown D[3]         20 grams\r\n  Hydrogen peroxide     400 grams\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\n  [3] Inasmuch as most manufacturers use the same letters to designate\r\n      the various dyes, any equivalent brand of fur dye may be used in\r\n      place of those here mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Black on Sheared Muskrat_\r\n\r\nThe skins are killed with soda, soured, and washed, then chrome mordanted\r\nfor 6 hours. Then they are dyed for 6 hours with\r\n\r\n  Rodol P               1.5 grams\r\n  Pyrogallic acid        .7 grams\r\n  Ammonia               2.0 grams\r\n  Hydrogen peroxide      45 grams\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nThe dyed skins are washed and dried, then tipped with\r\n\r\n  Rodol D                20 grams\r\n  Rodol DB                2 grams\r\n  Hydrogen peroxide     450 grams\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brown on Thibet Sheep Skin_\r\n\r\nThe killed skins are mordanted for 6 hours with a chrome mordant, then\r\ndyed for 6 hours with\r\n\r\n  Ursol P                 1 gram\r\n  Pyrogallic acid         1 gram\r\n  Ammonia                 2 grams\r\n  Hydrogen peroxide      40 grams\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to combine dyeings with the Oxidation Colors with\r\nVegetable dyeings, or with Aniline Black. For example, if it be desired\r\nto produce an imitation skunk on a raccoon, and an exceptionally fast and\r\nintense and lustrous black on the tips of the hair, the skins are dyed\r\nin the bath with the Oxidation dyes, and the tips of the hair are brushed\r\nwith a mixture such as described under Vegetable Colors for the production\r\nof French seal, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Imitation Skunk on Raccoon_\r\n\r\nThe skins are killed with caustic soda, soured and washed, then mordanted\r\nwith an iron-copper mordant as described, and then dyed with\r\n\r\n  Fur Grey R              3 grams\r\n  Ammonia                 2 grams\r\n  Peroxide of hydrogen   45 grams\r\n  Water                   1 liter\r\n\r\nAfter washing and drying, the dyed skins are brushed over with a mixture\r\nsuch as used for dyeing French seal with Vegetable Colors.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the Oxidation Colors may be used to give a base color\r\nto furs dyed by the Aniline Black process.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from these few illustrations that a great variety of shades\r\ncan be produced, and the dyeing of imitations of the better class of furs\r\non cheaper skins is a comparatively simple matter, after an understanding\r\nof the nature of the dyes has been obtained, and a certain amount of skill\r\nacquired in working with these dyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nFUR DYEING\r\n\r\nCOAL TAR DYES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Aniline Blacks and the Oxidation Colors already\r\ndiscussed there are certain of the synthetic coal tar dyes such as are\r\ngenerally used in the dyeing of textiles, which can also be applied on\r\nfurs. There are several classes of these dyes, varying somewhat in their\r\nnature, and consequently in their manner of application; in the main they\r\nproduce bright shades, such as are but seldom used on furs, yet which may\r\noccasionally serve for the production of novel effects. Basic, acid and\r\nchrome colors are the types which can be employed.\r\n\r\nBasic colors possess great fullness and tinctorial strength, but have a\r\ntendency to rub off, and the tips of the hair take a darker shade with\r\nthese dyes than the rest of the hair. The addition of acetic acid and\r\nGlauber’s salt to the dyebath will result in a more uniform dyeing. On\r\naccount of the comparatively poor fastness to rubbing and washing, basic\r\ndyes are used only for dyeing furs which are intended for cheap carpet\r\nrugs, such as sheep and goat. They may also find use in the production\r\nof light fancy shades on other white furs. The procedure is usually as\r\nfollows: The furs are killed in the customary manner with soap and soda\r\nor ammonia, or if this is insufficient, with milk of lime. A soap-bath is\r\nthen prepared containing 2.5–6 grams of olive-oil soap per liter of water.\r\nThe temperature of the bath is brought to 40° C. To this is added the\r\nsolution of the dyestuffs, prepared by mixing the required color or colors\r\nwith a little acetic acid to a paste, and then pouring boiling water on\r\nthe mixture until dissolved. Undissolved particles or foreign matter are\r\nremoved by passing this solution through a cotton cloth or sieve, and\r\nthe clear solution then mixed with the soap-bath. The well-washed skins\r\nare then entered into the dyebath and immersed for about half an hour,\r\nor until the desired depth of shade is obtained. They are then removed,\r\npressed or hydro-extracted and dried. For the production of light shades,\r\nthe following dyes may be used:\r\n\r\nFor cream, light sulphur-yellow, maize, salmon, etc.\r\n  Combinations of\r\n  Thioflavine\r\n  Rhodamine B\r\n  Irisamine G\r\n\r\nFor greenish-yellows\r\n  Combinations of\r\n  Thioflavine\r\n  Victoria Blue B\r\n\r\nFor light pink\r\n  Rhodamine B\r\n  Irisamine\r\n  Rose Bengal Extra N\r\n\r\nFor purple\r\n  Methyl Violet 3B–6B\r\n  Crystal Violet\r\n\r\nFor sky-blue\r\n  Victoria Blue B\r\n\r\nFor white\r\n  Victoria Blue B (Milk-white)\r\n  Methyl Violet 3B–6B\r\n  Crystal Violet (Ivory-white)\r\n\r\nTo produce very delicate shades, the moist dyed skins are subjected to a\r\nsulphur bleach overnight, to lighten the color, then rinsed, and dried.\r\nFull, brilliant shades may be obtained by dyeing in a bath of 40° C.,\r\nacidulated with 2–3 grams of acetic acid per liter of solution, the\r\nfollowing dyestuffs being suitable:\r\n\r\nFor yellow to orange\r\n  Thioflavine\r\n  Paraphosphine\r\n  Rhodamine\r\n  Safranine\r\n  New Magenta O\r\n\r\nFor pink\r\n  Rhodamine B\r\n  Rose Bengal Extra N\r\n\r\nFor light red\r\n  Safranines\r\n\r\nFor bordeaux and red\r\n  Magenta\r\n  New Magenta\r\n  Russian Red\r\n  Cerise\r\n\r\nFor violet\r\n  Methyl Violet 6B–4R\r\n  Crystal Violet 5B\r\n\r\nFor blue\r\n  Victoria Blue B\r\n  Methylene Blue BB\r\n  New Methylene Blue N\r\n\r\nFor green\r\n  Malachite Green Crystals\r\n  Brilliant Green Crystals, or combinations of\r\n  Thioflavine\r\n  Diamond Phosphine\r\n  Victoria Blue B\r\n\r\nFor brown\r\n  Chrysoidines\r\n  Bismarck Browns\r\n\r\nIn dyeing skins with harder hair than that of sheep or goat, mere killing\r\nis insufficient to render the hair capable of taking up the dye. The\r\nskins are therefore immersed before dyeing, in a cold, weak solution\r\nof chloride of lime, the affinity of the hair for the dye being thereby\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\nAcid dyes are employed when a greater fastness is required than can be\r\nobtained with the basic colors. Sulphuric acid in a quantity equal to\r\nhalf the weight of the dyestuffs used, together with four times that\r\nquantity of Glauber’s salt is added to the dyebath. Formic acid may be\r\nused in place of the sulphuric acid, very good results being obtained.\r\nThe skins are immersed in the dyebath, and worked until thoroughly soaked\r\nwith the dye liquor, and then allowed to remain until the proper depth\r\nof shade is attained, or overnight. The temperature of the solution is\r\nabout 40° C., and only very light shades can be produced in this manner.\r\nIn 1900 and again in 1914, the Cassella Co., a large German manufacturer\r\nof dyestuffs, obtained patents for processes enabling the dyeing of\r\nfurs in hot solution with the acid dyes. The method required that the\r\nskins be chrome-tanned in order to render them resistant to the action\r\nof hot solutions, the addition of a small amount of formaldehyde to the\r\nchrome solution increasing this effect. The skins are then treated with a\r\nsolution of chloride of lime in order to increase the affinity of the hair\r\nfor the dyestuffs. The method as it is now practised is as follows: The\r\nskins which have been cleaned and washed are chrome tanned by the method\r\nas described in the chapter on Tanning Methods, 60 grams of formaldehyde\r\nbeing added to every 10 liters of the chrome solution. After proper\r\ntanning the skins are rinsed, and while still moist they are subjected to\r\na treatment with chloride of lime. They are first immersed for 15 minutes\r\nin a cold bath containing 120 grams of hydrochloric acid 32–36° Twaddell\r\nper 10 liters of water, then without rinsing, they are entered into a bath\r\nmade up by adding gradually in four portions the clear solution of 2–4\r\ngrams of the chloride of lime per 10 liters of water. After working for\r\nan hour, the skins are removed and entered again into the acid solution,\r\nin which they are worked for another 15 minutes. In order to neutralize\r\nand remove the last traces of the chloride of lime from the furs, they are\r\nrinsed in a luke-warm bath containing 1–2 grams of sodium thiosulphate,\r\nor hyposulphite of soda, in 10 liters of water. The skins are then rinsed\r\nagain, and hydro-extracted, or pressed, and are ready for dyeing. The\r\ndyebath is prepared with the required quantity of dye, to which is added\r\n10–20% Glauber’s salt and 2–5% acetic acid (both calculated on the weight\r\nof the skins). The skins are entered at 20° C., then after three-quarters\r\nof an hour to 40° C., and then after another hour slowly to 50–55° C. For\r\nblacks, the temperature is raised as high as 65° C. After dyeing the skins\r\nare treated with a solution containing per 10 liters\r\n\r\n  90–120 grams of olive-oil soap\r\n   12–25 grams olive oil\r\n      12 grams ammonia\r\n\r\nfor 15 minutes, then hydro-extracted and dried, without further rinsing.\r\n\r\nFor this method of dyeing, the following dyes may be used:\r\n\r\nFor yellow and orange\r\n  Fast Yellow S\r\n  Acid Yellows\r\n  Naphthol Yellow S\r\n  Tropaeoline\r\n  Orange GG, R, II, IV\r\n\r\nFor reds\r\n  Acid Reds\r\n  Lanafuchsine\r\n  Azo Orseille\r\n\r\nFor violet\r\n  Azo Wool Violet\r\n  Acid Violets\r\n\r\nFor blue\r\n  Cyanole FF\r\n  Azo Wool Blue\r\n  Naphthol Blue R\r\n  Formyl Blue B\r\n\r\nFor green\r\n  Naphthol Green B\r\n  Fast Acid Green\r\n  Cyanole Green\r\n\r\nFor brown, combinations of\r\n  Fast Yellow S\r\n  Acid Yellows\r\n  Tropaeoline DD\r\n  Orange GG\r\n  Lanafuchsine\r\n  Indigo Blue N\r\n  Cyanole B\r\n  Fast Acid Green BN\r\n\r\nFor black\r\n  Naphthylamine Blacks\r\n  Naphthol Blacks\r\n  Naphthol Blue-black\r\n\r\nFor grey\r\n  Silver Grey N\r\n  Dyed with the addition of 1/2–1% of alum\r\n\r\nThe chrome colors are dyed on furs when very fast shades are desired, all\r\nthe fancy colors being produced in this manner, but for black, only the\r\nacid dyes are suitable. The preparation of the skin is exactly the same as\r\nfor the acid colors, except that the treatment with chloride of lime may\r\nbe omitted, although for very full shades it is desirable. The dyeing is\r\ncarried out as follows: The dyebath is prepared with the requisite amount\r\nof the desired dyestuff, which is previously dissolved, and to this is\r\nadded a solution of sodium bichromate, the amount of this substance being\r\nhalf the weight of the dye. The solution is heated and the skins entered\r\nand dyed for 1–2 hours at 70–80° C. Then the dyebath is exhausted by the\r\naddition of 1/3% acetic acid, the skins being worked for another half\r\nhour, then rinsed, hydro-extracted and dried. Any of the one-bath chrome,\r\nor after-chrome colors may be used for this method.\r\n\r\nRecently methods have been patented for the dyeing of furs by means of\r\nthe vat colors. Vat dyes are among the fastest coloring matters ever\r\nproduced, and their application on furs would be a great advantage, if\r\nsuitable shades could be obtained. The general process for dyeing with vat\r\ncolors, consists in reducing the dye, which is usually very insoluble,\r\ninto a soluble “leuco” compound, by means of hydrosulphites in the\r\npresence of alkalies. The leuco compound is not a dye itself, but when\r\nthe fibre absorbs it, and is then exposed to the air, the leuco compound\r\nis reoxidized to its original insoluble form, which remains fast and\r\npermanent. The use of strong alkalies in vat dyeing has hitherto been a\r\ngreat obstacle in the use of these dyestuffs, but in 1917, the Farbwerke\r\nHoechst, a large German dye works, patented a process as follows: “A\r\nprocess for dyeing furs with vat colors. The dyeing is done in solutions\r\nof the vat dyes (after the addition of gelatine or some other protective\r\ncolloid), which are rendered neutral or only slightly alkaline with\r\nammonia, by neutralizing the caustic soda of the solution of the leuco\r\ncompound of the vat dyes by the addition of ammonium salts, or suitable\r\nacids. The dyeings thus obtained are uniform and fast, the leather is dyed\r\nto only a slight degree, and shows no deleterious effects of the dyebath\r\non the tannage.” As a practical application of this process, another\r\npatent was taken out by the same company, also in 1917, as follows:\r\n“A process for producing fast blacks on furs, consisting of dyeing a\r\nground color with appropriate vat dyes in a hydrosulphite vat, and after\r\noxidation in air, topping with an Aniline or Diphenyl black. The dyeings\r\nobtained by the combination of vat dyes which are fast to oxidizing\r\nagents, with an oxidation black, have an appearance matching that of\r\nlogwood black in beauty; and with a dark-blue to blue-black under-color,\r\nand a full, deep black top color, cannot be distinguished from logwood.\r\nThese dyeings also have the advantage of being faster to light than\r\nlogwood or other blacks.”\r\n\r\nWhile these processes undoubtedly have many meritorious qualities which\r\nmake them interesting, they do not seem as yet, to have attained any\r\ngreat practical application. However, it is a field of fur dyeing which is\r\nworth while developing, and with certain necessary improvements in these\r\nprocesses, the vat dyes may yet supersede partially some of the other\r\nmethods of dyeing furs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBLEACHING OF FURS\r\n\r\n\r\nBleaching is for the purpose of lightening the color of furs, and is\r\nmost generally applied to white-haired skins such as white fox, ermine,\r\nand occasionally white lambs of all kinds, and white bears. Among such\r\nfurs, pelts of a naturally pure white tone are relatively scarce, while\r\nin the majority of cases the color ranges from a pale creamy white to a\r\ndecidedly yellowish shade. Colors which vary from the pure white detract\r\nconsiderably from the attractiveness and consequent value of the fur, and\r\nindeed, some pelts are so far off shade that they can only be used when\r\ndyed a darker color. Most white skins which are but slightly inferior in\r\ncolor can be brought to a pure white by bleaching, and they can then be\r\nused natural. Some pelts, on the other hand, are particularly resistant\r\nto the action of bleaching agents and cannot be sufficiently decolorized\r\nto render them suitable for use natural, so these are also dyed. For the\r\nproduction of certain delicate or fancy dyed shades on white furs, it is\r\noften necessary to bleach the skins in order to be able to obtain pure\r\ntones. Such instances are not very common, however. Occasionally dark\r\nfurs, such as beaver, are bleached on the tips of the hair, a golden shade\r\nbeing obtained thereby, which at one time was quite popular, but recently\r\nsuch effects have not been in vogue.\r\n\r\nIn the bleaching of furs, two steps may be distinguished, first\r\ndegreasing, and second, bleaching proper. In the preliminary operations\r\nof fur dressing, the furs are treated with soap or weak alkalies to\r\ncleanse them and to remove excess oil from the hair. During the various\r\nprocesses and manipulations, the hair, especially on white skins, may\r\nbecome soiled or somewhat greasy again, so it is advisable to repeat\r\nthe cleaning process. This should in every case be as light as possible,\r\nusing a weak solution of soap for the softer and cleaner pelts, or dilute\r\nsolutions of ammonium carbonate or soda ash for the more greasy-haired\r\nskins. The skins are then thoroughly rinsed to remove all traces of\r\nthe degreasing material. This step is very essential in order to obtain\r\nuniform bleaching.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, there are two general methods which can be used in\r\nbleaching furs, one involving the use of what are known as reducing\r\nagents, and the other employing oxidizing substances.\r\n\r\nAmong reducing agents which can be used for bleaching furs are sulphurous\r\nacid, and its salts such as sodium bisulphite and sodium sulphite;\r\nhydrosulphites, and derivatives.\r\n\r\n1. ~Sulphurous acid.~--When sulphur is burned, sulphur dioxide gas\r\nis formed. In the presence of moisture, or when dissolved in water,\r\nthis gas forms sulphurous acid, which is one of the most commonly used\r\nbleaching chemicals for all sorts of materials, and is very effective\r\nfor decolorizing furs. The procedure usually followed is to hang up the\r\nmoistened skins on wooden rods in a more or less cubical chamber made of\r\nstone or brick, and lined with wood or lead. No other metals may be used,\r\nbecause they are quickly corroded by the sulphurous acid. The requisite\r\nquantity of sulphur is placed in a pot in the bleaching chamber, and then\r\nignited, after which the doors are shut tight. The fumes of the burning\r\nsulphur in contact with the moist hair readily exert their bleaching\r\naction on the furs, and the operation is allowed to proceed for six or\r\neight hours, or overnight. Then by means of fans or other devices, the\r\nair filled with sulphur dioxide gas is withdrawn from the chamber, and\r\nreplaced by fresh air. The door is opened, the skins removed, exposed to\r\nthe air for a time, then rinsed, and finally dried and finished. Sometimes\r\none operation is not enough to sufficiently bleach the hair, so the\r\nprocess is repeated. Sulphur dioxide gas can now be obtained compressed\r\nin cylinders, which are more convenient to handle than burning sulphur.\r\nThe flow of gas which is introduced into the bleaching chamber by means\r\nof a nozzle attached to the cylinder, can be regulated, and the bleaching\r\nthus retarded or accelerated.\r\n\r\n2. ~Sodium bisulphite and sodium sulphite.~--These salts of sulphurous\r\nacid are effective in their bleaching action only when in solution in the\r\npresence of acids. The acids liberate sulphurous acid from the salts,\r\nso this method is virtually the same as 1. Instead of using the salts\r\nof sulphurous acid, sulphur dioxide may be dissolved in water, and the\r\nsolution used for bleaching by immersing the furs in it. This procedure,\r\nwhile consuming somewhat less time than the chamber process, is more\r\nlikely to affect the leather, which would have to be retanned. The\r\nprinciple is the same as that involved in method 1.\r\n\r\n3. ~Hydrosulphites and derivatives.~--The bleaching agent can be prepared\r\nby adding zinc dust to commercial bisulphite of soda dissolved in about\r\nfour times its weight of water until no more reaction is evident. Milk\r\nof lime is then added to precipitate the zinc, and the clear supernatant\r\nliquid of 1.5°–5° Tw. is used for bleaching. The skins are immersed\r\nfor 12–24 hours, taken out, washed and finished. Instead of preparing\r\nthe hydrosulphite, the commercial products may be used with greater\r\nconvenience, a solution containing 1–4% of the hydrosulphite powder being\r\nused, and the skins treated in this until satisfactorily bleached.\r\n\r\nThe bleaching action of sulphurous acid and hydrosulphite is supposed to\r\nbe due to the reduction of the coloring matter of the hair to a colorless\r\ncompound; or possibly to the formation of a colorless compound of the\r\nbleaching material with the pigment. The former seems the more probable\r\nexplanation, because the change is not a permanent one, the original\r\nnatural color returning after a long exposure of the bleached fur to air\r\nand light. However, the results are sufficiently enduring to satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the trade in the class of furs on which these methods of\r\nbleaching are used.\r\n\r\nBleaching chemicals with an oxidizing action generally used for\r\ndecolorizing furs are hydrogen peroxide and peroxides; occasionally\r\nhypochlorites and permanganates are also used.\r\n\r\n1. ~Hydrogen peroxide.~--Hydrogen peroxide is usually employed for\r\nbleaching in the form of its 3% solution, to which is added about 20\r\ncubic centimeters of ammonia per liter. The ammonia serves partially to\r\nneutralize the acid which commercial peroxide generally contains, and\r\nalso to facilitate the bleaching action. The thoroughly degreased skins\r\nare immersed in the solution until the hair is completely wetted by it,\r\nare then removed, and evenly pressed or hydro-extracted, after which\r\nthe pelts are hung up to dry in the air. As the hair becomes drier,\r\nthe concentration of the peroxide becomes greater, and consequently the\r\nbleaching action is stronger. Where there is a likelihood of the leather\r\nbeing affected by the bleaching solution, the ammoniacal peroxide may\r\nbe applied to the hair with a fine sponge or brush until sufficiently\r\nwetted, and then hanging the skins up to dry. Repetition of the process\r\nis sometimes necessary to obtain pure white, but the results are always\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\n2. ~Peroxides.~--The most important of these is sodium peroxide, which\r\ncomes on the market as a yellowish-white powder, which must be kept dry,\r\nand away from any inflammable material, as fires have been caused by the\r\ncontact of the peroxide with such substances. When dissolved in water, it\r\nis equivalent to a strongly alkaline solution of peroxide of hydrogen.\r\n\r\n   Na₂O₂  +  2H₂O  =  H₂O₂  +  2NaOH\r\n   sodium    water  peroxide   caustic\r\n  peroxide             of       soda\r\n                    hydrogen\r\n\r\nWhen dissolved in acid, the alkali is neutralized, and a neutral solution\r\nof peroxide of hydrogen and a salt is obtained, and this method is used\r\nto obtain peroxide of hydrogen cheaply.\r\n\r\n  Na₂O₂ + H₂SO₄ = H₂O₂ + Na₂SO₄\r\n        sulfuric         sodium\r\n          acid          sulphate\r\n\r\n3 parts of sodium peroxide are slowly dissolved in a cold 1% solution of\r\n4 parts of sulphuric acid, stirring during the addition, and making the\r\nresulting solution neutral to litmus paper, acid or more sodium peroxide\r\nbeing added as needed. There is then added 3–6 parts of a solution\r\nof silicate of soda of 90° Tw. The skins are immersed until properly\r\nbleached, taken out, passed through a weak acid solution, then washed\r\nand finished. This method generally requires the leather to be retanned\r\nafter bleaching. Another process, which involves the use of peroxides,\r\nbut which is not commonly practised, consists in rubbing the hair with\r\na pasty mixture of equal parts of water, barium dioxide, and silicate of\r\nsoda, hanging up the skins to dry, and then beating and brushing the hair.\r\n\r\n3. ~Permanganates.~--The only member of this group that finds practical\r\napplication for bleaching purposes is potassium permanganate. The skins\r\nare immersed in a 0.1% solution of the crystals of potassium permanganate,\r\nuntil the hair acquires a deep brown color. They are then removed, rinsed,\r\nand entered into a second bath containing sulphurous acid in solution,\r\nprepared by acidifying a solution of sodium bisulphite. The skins are then\r\nworked in this until fully bleached. It is the permanganate which does\r\nthe bleaching, the sulphurous acid being for the purpose of dissolving\r\nthe brown compound of manganese formed on the hair.\r\n\r\n4. ~Hypochlorites.~--Chloride of lime and sodium hypochlorite, which is\r\nprepared from the former, are the chief chemicals of this type used for\r\nbleaching. The skins are entered into a weak solution of the hypochlorite,\r\nand left until the hair is decolorized; then after removing, they are\r\npassed through a dilute acid, and subsequently through a weak solution of\r\nsodium thiosulphate in order to remove all traces of the hypochlorite.\r\nThis method causes the hair to acquire a harsh feel, and the yellow\r\ncolor is never entirely eliminated. The hair, however, possesses a\r\ngreat affinity for certain types of dyestuffs, and it is only when\r\nthese particular classes of dyes are to be applied to the furs, that the\r\nhypochlorite bleach is used. (See dyeing with Acid colors).\r\n\r\nThe various oxidation methods of bleaching are supposed to change the\r\ncoloring matter of the hair into an entirely different and colorless\r\ncompound which cannot return to its original form. The bleach is therefore\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nIn common practise, the sulphurous acid, and the peroxide of hydrogen\r\nmethods are the two chiefly employed in bleaching processes. Sulphurous\r\nacid is used to bleach the cheaper kinds of furs, while peroxide of\r\nhydrogen is applied to the finer furs.\r\n\r\nWhichever process is used, it is customary to give the bleached skins a\r\nsubsequent “blueing,” by passing them through a very weak solution of a\r\nblue or violet dye, such as indigo-carmine, crystal violet, alkali blue\r\nor ultramarine. The furs are then dried and finished off as usual. In drum\r\ncleaning white furs, gypsum or white sand, or sometimes even talc are used\r\nwith the sawdust, or occasionally alone without the sawdust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  Allen “Commercial Organic Analysis”\r\n\r\n  Armour, B.
