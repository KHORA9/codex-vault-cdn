B. LIPPINCOTT COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADY LAWYER'S FIRST CLIENT.\r\n\r\nTWO PARTS.--II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat with Mrs. Stiles's ankle and the law's delays, the case was not\r\ntried until September. But at the September term Stiles _vs._ The\r\nRailway Company was reached, and stood at the head of the list.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fated day Mrs. Tarbell could have proceeded to the\r\ncourt-room in state, for not only did the entire Stiles family present\r\nitself at her office three-quarters of an hour before the time, but Mr.\r\nMecutchen, the tobacconist, also dropped in, with an air of always being\r\nearly at trials.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't keep ma at home, Mrs. Tarbell,\" said Miss Stiles briefly,\r\nbut with some little shame. \"She would come. She thought it would take\r\nan hour and a half to get here from Pulaski Street; didn't you, ma?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles gave an agitated groan and looked about helplessly for a\r\nchair. She was walking with a cane, and had on a miraculous black silk,\r\nthe seams of which were like the ridges of a ploughed field. Miss\r\nGeorgiana Stiles, the younger daughter, was almost invisible under a\r\nstraw hat with feathers waving from its pinnacled crown. Miss Celandine,\r\nby no means a bad-looking young lady, wore her best black jersey,\r\nbuttoned at the throat, over her cambric body, her best pique skirt,\r\ntrimmed with torchon lace, her white silk mitts, and her blue-and-white\r\nbonnet. After settling Mrs. Stiles in a corner with Georgiana, Tecumseh\r\nSherman, and Augustus, Celandine and Mr. Mecutchen disappeared, to go\r\nand stand on the door-step. Mrs. Tarbell guessed where they were going,\r\nand would have liked to hint that the door-step was not a dignified\r\nplace for her client, but, if the truth must be told, she was afraid to\r\ndo so. For Miss Stiles had by this time utterly and completely\r\nsubjugated her, and Mrs. Tarbell hardly knew which of them was the\r\nattorney of record in Stiles _vs._ The Railway Company. There can be no\r\ndoubt that Miss Celandine was an admirable young lady. She was paying\r\nthe expenses of the case out of her own savings,--savings which had been\r\nthe secret result of secret labors with the pen and type-writer. As soon\r\nas the accident happened she quitted the High School, put aside her\r\nbooks, and divided her time between nursing her mother and keeping the\r\nbooks of a successful but illiterate milliner, who offered her a place;\r\nand she gave so many other evidences of good sense and determination\r\nthat Mrs. Tarbell felt it would be hopeless to try to resist her. Her\r\ndecision did not seem to have altered in the least, nor was she at all\r\ndiscouraged by Mrs. Tarbell's warnings; and Mrs. Tarbell found that in\r\nevery conversation which took place on the subject Mrs. Tarbell began as\r\na philosopher and ended as a disputant. All that could be done was to\r\ngive Miss Stiles her own way and try to improve her taste in dress if\r\npossible. It was practically understood between them, though Mrs.\r\nTarbell had as yet refused to commit herself, that as soon as the trial\r\nwas over and the damages had been pocketed, Miss Celandine should be\r\nduly installed, enrolled, and accredited as a student in the office of\r\nJuddson and Tarbell. In the mean time, Augustus had been made an\r\noffice-boy through Mr. Juddson's interest.\r\n\r\nThe Stileses having been sent on before, Mrs. Tarbell, attended by the\r\noffice-boy bearing a bag full of books and papers, slipped quietly over\r\nto court, whither Mr. Juddson said he would follow her in a few moments.\r\nThe room was crowded. Judge Measy had not yet appeared.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarbell looked about her. It was the first day of the autumn term,\r\nand, for one reason or another, the bar was very fully represented.\r\nThere was ex-Judge Dingley, with his frills and his snuff-box; Mr.\r\nModdison, with his shaggy eyebrows and square jaw; Mr. Brileson, almost\r\nas long and thin as his nose; Mr. Eakins, looking as much like Oily\r\nGammon as ever; and, besides the leaders of the bar, any number of the\r\nrank and file, especially of the junior members of the profession; and\r\nwith some of these young gentlemen's elder brothers Mrs. Tarbell had\r\ndanced, once on a time. There was a stir as Mrs. Tarbell came in; the\r\nlawyers made way for her, and the jurors, witnesses, and spectators\r\ncraned their necks to get a look at her. Among the spectators, of\r\ncourse, were Mrs. Pegley and the Pegleyites. Mrs. Tarbell knew that they\r\nwere there, but did not look at them. Mr. Pope rose magnificent and\r\nshook hands with her; several persons shook hands with her. Mrs. Tarbell\r\nfelt that she was going to acquit herself commendably. She had gone\r\nover the case three or four times with Alexander, she had rehearsed her\r\nspeech until she knew it by heart, she had joked about the case with her\r\nfriends (not her Pegley friends) at Cape May until she was no longer\r\nafraid of it, if she ever had been, and she was quite able to feel that\r\nPope was insignificant. She had at first been filled with an\r\napprehension that he would become very intimate with her on the strength\r\nof their mutual antagonism; but when several days passed by, and he had\r\ndone nothing more than bow courteously, she reflected that, after all,\r\nit was not a very uncommon occurrence for him to have a jury case; and\r\nwhen he privately came and offered to compromise she wondered what there\r\nhad ever been to frighten her in the man. She refused the compromise, of\r\ncourse: if her case had been only half as strong she would have refused\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRap! rap! Silence, please. His honor appeared, wiping his learned brow,\r\nfor it was an oppressively hot day, and the clerk proclaimed that all\r\npersons might draw near and be heard by the honorable court. The jurors\r\nanswered to their names. Mr. Juddson, seated by his sister's elbow,\r\npushed the jury-list towards her, with a slight nod of encouragement.\r\nMrs. Tarbell did not need encouragement: she knew the names of the\r\nobjectionable jurors by heart, and she was quite ready.\r\n\r\nThe court-room settled down into a hush of subdued expectation, and\r\nStiles _vs._ The Railway Company was called. Mr. Pope and Mrs. Tarbell\r\nrose, bowed to each other and to the court: they were ready to go on.\r\n\r\nMr. Pope drew first blood. Eight jurors were already in the box, and the\r\nclerk called out, \"John Ewing.\" John Ewing took his seat; there was no\r\ncross against his name, and Mrs. Tarbell had no challenge to make, when,\r\nbefore another name could be called, he leaned forward and called out,\r\nin an easy voice, \"Mrs. Tarbell, ef I have to swear in this case I mout\r\nas well tell you that I used to work for the railway company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Mrs. Tarbell calmly, after a moment's hesitation. \"Take your\r\nseat, Mr. Ewing. I have entire confidence in your impartiality.\" She\r\nwaved her hand as if to include the whole of the jury, so far as\r\ncompleted,--nay, the whole of the panel,--in the compliment, and the\r\njurors appeared to be suitably impressed.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Pope rose. \"Wait one minute, Mr. Ewing,\" he said, in a voice\r\nwhich breathed rugged honesty and uncompromising determination. \"I shall\r\nhave to ask you to withdraw.\" He shook his head sternly. \"I cannot,\r\nwhatever may be the generous toleration of my learned opponent, I cannot\r\nknowingly allow anybody who has any connection with my client to go on\r\nthe jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes four challenges for him,\" whispered Mr. Juddson. Mrs.\r\nTarbell shook her head impatiently, and as Mr. Ewing left the box he\r\nsmiled a faint yet unmistakable smile at somebody in the crowd, and Mrs.\r\nTarbell became instantly convinced that the whole affair, even to the\r\ndrawing of Mr. Ewing's name by the court clerk, was a neatly-arranged\r\nplot of Mr. Pope's, and, in her resentment, she challenged the next\r\njuror out of hand, though he had an eye so humid and sympathetic that he\r\nlooked good for not only sentimental damages, but punitive damages of\r\nthe most revengeful description.\r\n\r\nBut she opened her case admirably. There was a slight hum as she rose;\r\nher attitude was dignified, and she might have been called handsome.\r\nThough every one else was stifling with the heat, she looked cool and\r\nself-possessed, and her first sentences won her the respect of the bar;\r\nfor she made the matter-of-course explanation in a fairly novel manner.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" said she, \"you know without my telling you that\r\nwhen my client, the plaintiff, Mrs. Stiles, comes here and says that she\r\nhas suffered at the hands of the railway company damages to the amount\r\nof ten thousand dollars, she is not exaggerating her sufferings for the\r\nsake of enlisting your sympathy. It is not that she comes to you with\r\nfeminine weakness, displaying her injuries, and, with feminine\r\nresentment, overstating them and their effects, to rouse your pity. You\r\nknow, and I only remind you of it, that the rule of law forbids you to\r\ngive her more than she asks for: so I, on her behalf, take care that she\r\nshall not ask for less than you might give her.\"\r\n\r\nThis was very well, and the jury probably understood as much.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarbell paused a moment, and then proceeded in an impressive voice:\r\n\"But Mrs. Stiles's injuries, gentlemen, are not slight; she does not ask\r\nyou for a mere nominal sum in compensation of them, nor, in view of the\r\nfacts, will any sum that you do give her seem excessive. I shall show\r\nyou, gentlemen, that Mrs. Stiles, a widow, left almost penniless by her\r\nhusband, who has by her own efforts brought up and educated four\r\nchildren, two of whom are still entirely dependent upon her, was, on the\r\nninth day of April last, through the negligence of the defendant,\r\ninjured in such a way as to give her seven weeks of the most painful\r\nsuffering and to render her unable for the rest of her life to do the\r\nwork upon which she has hitherto mainly depended for the support of\r\nherself and her family. I shall show you that Mrs. Stiles attempted to\r\nget on one of the defendant's cars; that while she was so doing the car\r\nwas started and she thrown off; that she sustained a sprain of the right\r\nankle and a fracture of the fibula; that the accident has resulted in\r\nlaming her for life and incapacitating her for the use of a\r\nsewing-machine; and that it was by her sewing-machine that she supported\r\nherself. Mrs. Stiles will now tell you her own story.\"\r\n\r\nWith this Mrs. Tarbell sat down. She had not the keen penetration which\r\nyears of practice give to a finished advocate, but she had feminine\r\ninstinct, which served her in quite as good stead; and, short as was the\r\ntime she had been addressing that jury, she felt that she could answer\r\nfor it as certainly as fifteen years before she could have answered for\r\none of her admirers. If Mr. Juddson had only been another woman she\r\ncould have told him this, but a glance would have been wasted on him: so\r\nshe kept her triumph to herself. She looked at the bullet-headed young\r\njuror, at the benignant old juror, at the fat-faced and dropsical juror,\r\nat the preternaturally-solemn negro juror, at the lantern-jawed foreman\r\nwith the black moustache; she was on a perfectly good understanding with\r\nthem, and knew what to say to each one of them. She felt that she could\r\nhave afforded to be a little less brief. However, Mrs. Stiles would\r\nnot-- By the way, where was Mrs. Stiles?\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Stiles!\" cried Mrs. Tarbell, half rising. \"Mrs. Stiles, will you\r\nplease take the stand?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles rose from her seat against the railing, and, after confiding\r\nher second daughter to the care of Miss Celandine,--a ceremony which was\r\nperformed by her with evident anxiety,--hobbled to the witness-stand on\r\nthe arm of Mr. Mecutchen, who had been sitting beside her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles on the witness-stand was a very different person,\r\napparently, from Mrs. Stiles in an every-day situation. It may have been\r\nthe effect of the crowd or the effect on her system of her long and\r\npainful illness, but she was agitated and nervous to the last degree.\r\nShe looked steadily at Mrs. Tarbell, except when, every now and then,\r\nshe looked uneasily about the room, and she gave her answers in so low a\r\nvoice that the judge two or three times asked her to repeat them. But\r\notherwise all went well enough. Mrs. Stiles knew who she was, where she\r\nlived, and what she had been doing on the day of the accident. When the\r\ncritical moment came, Mrs. Tarbell caught her breath, but Mrs. Stiles\r\navoided the difficulty in safety.\r\n\r\n\"I held up my umbereller for that there car to stop,\" she said; \"and it\r\nstopped. And I went to git on; and then the first thing I knew I was\r\nfalling.\"\r\n\r\nThis was highly satisfactory. For the rest, Mrs. Stiles described the\r\nmanner in which the doctors had vainly endeavored to cure her injured\r\nankle, told how she had passed sleepless night after night in spite of\r\nthe morphia and sweet spirits of nitre, how she had been confined to her\r\nbed for three weeks and had only got up to be moved to a chair, how she\r\nsuffered _tortures_ and lost her appetite, how it was months before she\r\ncould walk without crutches, and how every step she took gave her the\r\nmost excruciating agony, and so forth, and so forth. She also, at Mrs.\r\nTarbell's request, gave to the jury several interesting details\r\nconcerning, first, her sewing-machine; second, the income she had been\r\nused to make by it; third, the effect of the accident upon her power to\r\npropel the aforesaid engine.\r\n\r\n(Bill shown to witness.)\r\n\r\n\"This is my doctor--Dr. Laycock's bill: it is not paid yet.\"\r\n\r\n(Offered in evidence. Another bill shown to witness.)\r\n\r\n\"This is the apothecary's bill. It has not been paid.\"\r\n\r\n(Offered in evidence.)\r\n\r\n\"Cross-examine,\" said Mrs. Tarbell; and Mrs. Stiles slowly turned and\r\nbegan to hobble away from the witness-stand.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Stiles!\" cried Mrs. Tarbell; and Mrs. Stiles turned round aghast.\r\n\r\n\"Come back, my dear madam,\" said the Honorable Pope blandly. \"We are not\r\nquite through with you yet,--not for a moment or two.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles looked more overcome than ever. \"My goodness! I forgot,\" she\r\nstammered, and clutched desperately at the front of the witness-box.\r\n\r\nMr. Pope ran his hand through his flowing locks and smiled at her\r\nreassuringly. After asking her one or two sympathetic questions about\r\nher ankle,--she was _quite_ sure she had obeyed all the doctor's orders?\r\nshe was certain she had not begun to walk too soon, or injured herself\r\nby any carelessness of her own?--he suddenly opened upon her.\r\n\r\n\"Now, madam,\" he said, \"is it not a fact that that car was in motion\r\nwhen you tried to get on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--how do you mean, sir?\" faltered Mrs. Stiles.\r\n\r\n\"Was not that car moving when you got on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Moving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam! _Moving!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, ye--yes,\" said Mrs. Stiles. \"So far's I remember, it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I thought so,\" said Mr. Pope, with a peculiar intonation; and after\r\nthat he proceeded with great suavity to cross-examine her into a state\r\nof utter bewilderment. As to what had happened after the accident she\r\ncontradicted herself six or seven times over, eagerly accepting any\r\nsuggestion which he held out to her; and Mr. Pope glanced triumphantly\r\nat the jury,--neglecting, however, to remind them that Mrs. Stiles had\r\nfainted as soon as her ankle was fractured, and that she was now only\r\nexpressing an opinion that his suggestions were probably correct.\r\n\r\nMiss Stiles and Mr. Mecutchen plainly betrayed their agitation, but Mrs.\r\nTarbell preserved her equanimity. When Mr. Pope had finished his\r\ncross-examination, she addressed her client again. Mrs. Stiles, pale,\r\nagitated, trembling with fright, was leaning against her railing, almost\r\nbending double over it; but at the sound of her lawyer's voice she\r\nappeared to take courage.\r\n\r\n\"You said just now, Mrs. Stiles,\" said Mrs. Tarbell, \"that the car was\r\nin motion while you were getting on--\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the Honorable Pope, interrupting her.\r\n\r\n\"I think it is so,\" said Mrs. Tarbell, turning upon him with a very\r\nhaughty air. \"I don't think Mrs. Stiles ever said that she tried to get\r\non while the car was in motion. Pray look at your notes, Mr. Pope.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Mr. Pope, sinking back into his chair. \"I remember\r\nnow. It is quite the same thing,\" he continued, waving his hand\r\ncarelessly. \"It makes no difference whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you _think_ so,\" said Mrs. Tarbell loftily; and she reiterated her\r\nquestion to Mrs. Stiles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles fumbled with the lilac-silk tie about her neck, and\r\nsaid,--Mrs. Tarbell hung upon her words,--\"That car--\"\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n\"That car had stopped before I went to git on,--I know _that_. And I\r\n_went_ to git on; and after that I don't remember.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when Mrs. Stiles finally hobbled back to her seat, a more woe-begone\r\nand wretched-looking object it would have been hard to find anywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Why, ma, what's the matter with you?\" cried Miss Celandine, as Mr.\r\nMecutchen went to take the stand. \"Don't you see it's all right?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles shook her head and rubbed her damp brow with her\r\nhandkerchief. \"I don't feel no certainty about it, Celandine,\" she said.\r\n\"I wisht Mrs. Tarbell had let me accep' that compr'mise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mamma!\" cried Miss Celandine, in warning tones.\r\n\r\n\"Well--I think I would have been better satisfied. Because--because\r\nmebbe I was the one to blame, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Ssh_, ma! After you have come into court! It's ridiculous! Plenty of\r\npeople saw you. Listen to Mr. Mecutchen, if you want to know what\r\nhappened to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wisht,\" said Mrs. Stiles, \"I wisht Mrs. Tarbell would say something\r\nto the jury about how the railroad offered to compromise. That would\r\nshow 'em 'twas true about my accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mamma!_ Be careful! If they hear you talking about that compromise\r\nthey'll stop the trial right here and turn us right out of court.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but they _did_, Celandine: they offered me six hu--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma, will you hush?\" said Celandine; and when her daughter spoke in that\r\ntone of voice, Mrs. Stiles knew that she must obey. She relapsed into\r\nsilence again, helpless and despairing.\r\n\r\nMecutchen testified, Vickers testified, Parthenheimer\r\ntestified,--Stethson had gone to Baton Rouge, according to\r\nMecutchen,--and all were as strong as could be. Dr. Laycock identified\r\nhis bill, swore that his treatment of Mrs. Stiles was in accordance with\r\nthe most recent discoveries in medical science, that Mrs. Stiles had\r\nsuffered unheard-of agonies, and that she had obeyed all his directions\r\nto the letter.\r\n\r\nMiss Celandine also swore to her mother's agonies, and described the\r\ncondition to which the household had been brought by Mrs. Stiles's\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Tarbell bowed to the judge, and said, \"That is my case, your\r\nhonor.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a very good case, too,\" she thought, as she sat down.\r\n\r\nPope's cross-examination had effected nothing, and the judge was against\r\nhim. Alexander, with his thumbs in his waistcoat, looked entirely\r\nsatisfied; Judge Measy, fanning himself and gasping under the heat,\r\nappeared to be anxious for Mr. Pope to get through his flimsy defence as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Pope rose, flung back his hair, paused a moment, and then began. He\r\nthanked his learned opponent for kindly putting the jury on the track of\r\na suggestion which he himself might have been delicate about making to\r\nthem. He would have been unwilling to dwell upon the--hem--peculiar\r\n_status_ of his opponent; but she herself had seen fit to take it for\r\ngranted that he intended to advance a certain class of arguments, and he\r\nconsequently considered it only fair to her to do so. He should not,\r\nhowever, call them arguments: they were rather considerations which\r\nwould serve to explain the arguments which Mrs. Tarbell herself had\r\nused. \"My learned opponent,\" said Mr. Pope, \"told you that you mustn't\r\nthink of her client as a woman who comes here and asks for your\r\nsympathy; you mustn't, she says, suppose that there is any feminine\r\nweakness or resentment about Mrs. Stiles, nor, for a stronger\r\nreason,--such is the unexpressed conclusion,--is there any feminine\r\nweakness about Mrs. Stiles's eloquent counsel. Well, gentlemen, if Mrs.\r\nStiles is not a woman, what is she? Is she a white elephant? Is she a\r\nfemale suffragist? which, I have heard, is neither man nor woman.\"\r\n(Immense laughter in court, indignation in the cheeks of Mrs. Tarbell, a\r\nlofty and contemptuous frown on the forehead of Mrs. Pegley.)\r\n\"Gentlemen, with the greatest possible respect for Mrs. Stiles, whose\r\npainful sufferings I greatly deplore, and to whom I wish to tender my\r\nentire sympathies; with, too, the greatest respect for my friend Mrs.\r\nTarbell, in admiration for whose talents and determination I yield to\r\nnobody, I feel it my duty to say to you that this accident having\r\nhappened through the negligence, excusable perhaps, but still the\r\nnegligence,--carelessness, haste, if you will,--of Mrs. Stiles,--and\r\nthat this was the case I shall show you in a moment,--Mrs. Stiles and\r\nher counsel, neither of them being for a single instant anything but a\r\nwoman, took the--what shall I say?--the romantic view of the matter\r\nimmediately. Romance, gentlemen, breathes its tender and refining\r\ninfluence about the domestic fireside, chastens and sanctifies the\r\natmosphere of home, leads us, we all know, gentlemen, to holier and\r\npurer views of life, and nerves us for the bitter struggle of the world.\r\nBut romance outside of the home-circle cuts but a sorry figure; it is\r\nvery dangerous for it to stray out of doors into the rough arena of\r\nlife,--into the street, gentlemen,--where there are street-cars. We must\r\nlook at the evils of life from the strictly legal point of view when\r\nthey come into court, gentlemen; and when his honor shall have laid down\r\nto you the doctrine of contributory negligence, the bearings of which on\r\nthis case you have already thought of, I don't doubt,--when you come to\r\napply that rule to this case, you will make short work, I am afraid, of\r\nromance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pope then proceeded to say that the case was in a nutshell. The\r\nplaintiff had called a car; the driver of the car had pulled up his\r\nhorses; it was a wet day, the wheels would not stop quickly, and Mrs.\r\nStiles was in a hurry to get on; she tried to board the car while it was\r\nin motion, and was thrown off. Was there any law to make a railway\r\ncompany responsible for such accidents as this? or any railway company\r\nthat would not go out of business immediately if it _were_ to be held so\r\nresponsible?\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Pope called his witnesses. He was a very short time examining\r\nthem; he bit his lips when he heard their answers. Mrs. Tarbell's\r\ncross-examination was also short. Alexander whispered to her to cut it\r\nshort,--that the testimony was almost an admission of her case by\r\nitself. But to Mrs. Stiles all these things were terribly significant of\r\nvictory for Mr. Pope; and the very fact that Mrs. Tarbell offered no\r\nrebutting testimony was somehow twisted into another evidence of\r\napproaching disaster by her poor stupid old mind. She hardly heard a\r\nword of Mrs. Tarbell's speech to the jury. She was looking forward in\r\nagony to what Mr. Pope would say. For she knew he was right. She knew\r\nthat Mrs. Tarbell had been carried away by her sympathies; she was sure\r\nof it. Oh, why had she not gone to a gentleman lawyer? He would have\r\nadvised her not to bring suit; at least he would have allowed her to\r\naccept that compromise. She was all alone. Celandine and Mr. Mecutchen\r\nhad gone away somewhere,--gone to get some ice-cream: they would be\r\nback. Should she go and fling herself at Mr. Pope's feet and confess\r\neverything?\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Tarbell sat down there was a hum of applause, and the judge\r\nstopped waving his fan for a moment to give Mrs. Tarbell a\r\nscarcely-perceptible nod of approval.\r\n\r\n\"If I know anything, it'll be a two-thousand-dollar werdick,\" mumbled\r\none of the tipstaves.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Pope got on his legs. He passed his hand over his face, and\r\nthere was a countenance for you!--luminous, inspired, magical; a face\r\none moment like to a running brook for poetry and liquid sentiment, the\r\nlines and wrinkles on it shifting about and rippling sweetly down into\r\nhis chin, where they cascaded off, so to speak; the next moment like a\r\nmighty and rugged rock, a stronghold of security and protection, on\r\nwhich he presently smote, Moses-like, and the brook of which I spoke\r\ngushed out again.\r\n\r\n\"You know already, gentlemen,\" said he, \"my view of this case. I think\r\nthat by this time it must be yours also.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles moaned. Then Mr. Pope proved to the jury that it was utter\r\nnonsense for Mrs. Stiles's witnesses to pretend that they had seen the\r\naccident, because the ordinary pedestrian looks at his nose when he is\r\nwalking, and not at the car-track. The jury smiled, the room grew hotter\r\nand hotter, and the judge whiter and whiter.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mecutchen?\" cried Mr. Pope. \"Mr. Mecutchen never laid eyes on Mrs.\r\nStiles until he saw her lying in the middle of the street. I don't say\r\nhe is intentionally prevaricating. Of course he thinks he saw all that\r\nhe says he did. I grew up in the firm conviction that I had known Judas\r\nIscariot. I was ten years old before I could be persuaded that it was\r\nonly a sweet delusion,--a dazzling dream of childhood, too bright to\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\nThe jury roared.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Pope talked of his own witnesses, and the virtues with which he\r\ndidn't invest those remarkable beings may exist in heaven, but are\r\ncertainly not to be found on earth, nor even in any of the intermediate\r\nplanetary paradises known to the Spiritualists.\r\n\r\nAnd then--then he descended on Mrs. Stiles herself.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" he cried, suddenly, turning with an outburst of indignant\r\nimpatience from the petty arguments into which his love for the\r\nexhibition of the whole truth in all its details had led him, \"what are\r\nyou told by the most respectable and conscientious witness who has\r\nappeared here to-day? What is the testimony of the one person who ought\r\nto know _everything_ about this case? What does Mrs. Stiles say?\r\nNothing. She says nothing. She doesn't know what happened. If this were\r\na strong case, she would describe to you with minute particularity the\r\nmanner in which she put her hand upon the rail of the car, stepped on,\r\nwas jolted, tried to save herself, was thrown off. But not a word of\r\nthis have you heard from her. All that she remembers, as she confesses,\r\nis that the car was in motion when she got on it.\"\r\n\r\nOh, where was Celandine? Had she gone out only to get ice-cream, or\r\nbecause Georgiana was so hot that she couldn't stand it any longer? Mrs.\r\nStiles could not remember. Maybe it was Mr. Mecutchen that had spoken of\r\nthe ice-cream, and Celandine was going to put Georgiana in the cars and\r\nsend her home. It would have been better to send Augustus home with her.\r\nAnd where were Augustus and Tecumseh Sherman?\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles looked about the room. She saw no friendly faces, nobody to\r\nencourage her, nobody whom she could apply to in her distress. How hot\r\nit was! Could she not go over to the window and get a breath of air? The\r\nroom was very crowded. Mrs. Stiles hesitated, half rose, hesitated\r\nagain, and then got up and limped outside of the railings. People made\r\nway for her, and when she reached the window a dark-faced man gave her a\r\nplace, and she went through a sort of parody of putting her head out\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nThe dark man looked at her thoughtfully. \"Shan't I get you a glass of\r\nwater?\" said he. Mrs. Stiles accepted his kindness with immense\r\ngratitude. The dark man went and brought the water, and watched her with\r\na pair of very keen eyes while she was drinking it.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pope is making a good speech,\" he said presently.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stiles groaned. \"Do you think he'll win?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Win?\" said the dark man, with a pleasant smile. \"Well, I should think\r\nso. Just listen to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm not saying anything to Mrs. Tarbell's discredit,\" said the\r\nHonorable Pope. \"Not a bit of it. Not a bit of it. Her feelings do her\r\ninfinite honor. In her appearance on our wordy and contentious stage I\r\nsee the commencement of a new era of things. Let her be guided by her\r\nfeelings. Let her still preserve that beautiful sympathy which is one of\r\nthe chiefest ornaments of the female sex. It will bring to her a\r\nthousand cases of injustice and oppression which we hardened lawyers of\r\nthe other sex have lost--if we ever had it--the instinct to detect. It\r\nwill lead her and her sisters to find justice and consolation for\r\ninnumerable victims of wrong-doing, whose hopes of obtaining redress\r\nmight have seemed poor and empty to us less inspired practitioners. No\r\none, no man, however jealous and crabbed in temper, will be sorry to see\r\nthe law vivified by a spark of that genius, that inexplicable instinct\r\nby which women know what is right and make right to be done, where men\r\nfail and fail again.\" Here Mr. Pope paused, and his features were those\r\nof an angel. Then his expression changed to one of the most remarkable\r\nsagacity and wariness. \"But no one, gentlemen, will fail to recognize\r\nthe danger, easily avoided, which accompanies the lubricating, so to\r\nspeak, of our legal machinery by this sometimes superabundant sympathy.\r\nEven genius errs, even instinct may be mistaken. Take the present case.\r\nMy learned opponent would be acting strictly within her duty by bringing\r\nthis case before you to ask for your decision. A man would do that. A\r\ncasehardened lawyer like myself would do that. But a man would take it\r\nfor granted his client was wrong, if he were beaten. Perhaps my learned\r\nopponent will do the same thing. But if she does I shall be mistaken. In\r\nall her subsequent career, which will be marked by more generosity,\r\ncharity, and enthusiasm than can now be boasted of by any man at the\r\nbar, she never will believe that the verdict which I am asking you to\r\ngive was just to Mrs. Stiles. But she will be wrong. Right in a hundred\r\nother cases, perhaps,--let that stand for the proportion, if you\r\nwill,--but wrong in this. And nothing but her misapplied sympathy and\r\ntenderness of heart could have lent her the vigor and earnestness which\r\nshe has displayed to-day.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, one thing more.\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll fetch 'em,\" said the dark man decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" moaned Mrs. Stiles, half aloud, \"why didn't Mrs. Tarbell let me\r\naccept that there compromise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Compromise?\" said the dark man quickly. \"Why, are you Mrs. Stiles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Stiles, drawing back in great alarm.\r\n\r\n\"And you say you were offered a compromise by the railway company which\r\nyour lawyer didn't let you accept?\" said the dark man, in lower tones.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Mrs. Stiles hesitatingly.\r\n\r\nThe dark man struck his hand against the window-seat. \"Well, upon my\r\nword!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I ought to have took it?\" said poor Mrs. Stiles, in a\r\nstifled voice.\r\n\r\nThe dark man eyed her pityingly. \"You've lost your chance now,\" said he.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden cry, a great bustle in the court-room, a rush toward\r\nthe judge's bench. Mr. Pope stopped short in his speech, looked up, and\r\nhastened to follow the court clerk, who had sprung over the desk, though\r\nMr. Pope went round by the side-bar. The judge had swooned in his chair,\r\nfalling forward upon his desk. The heat had at last got the upper hand\r\nof him, after a severe fight of two or three hours. Jurymen, witnesses,\r\nspectators, all stood aghast. The judge was brought to and assisted to\r\nhis room, and the court clerk, presently returning to the disturbed and\r\nexcited forum, announced that, his honor being unwell, all parties would\r\nbe dismissed until to-morrow morning at ten o'clock,--and there was a\r\ngeneral rush for the door.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that when Miss Stiles and Mr. Mecutchen came back to the\r\ncourt-room they found it closed, and neither Mrs. Stiles nor Mrs.\r\nTarbell anywhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, at ten o'clock, Mrs. Tarbell was wondering what had\r\nbecome of the Stileses. She had missed Mrs. Stiles the day before, after\r\nthe sudden adjournment of the court, but she had been detained by Pegley\r\nand friends, and thought it not unnatural that her client should have\r\ndecided not to wait for her. She was rather glad the accident had\r\nhappened,--that is, she was not sorry on her own account,--for the\r\ndelay had given her time to prepare one or two witticisms in answer to\r\nMr. Pope. She greeted Mr. Pope with a pleasant smile as he came into\r\ncourt, but Mr. Pope seemed rather surprised to find her in such a serene\r\nframe of mind.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, my dear madam,\" said he, coming up to her instantly, and\r\nspeaking in his most earnest tones, \"I assure you that I had nothing to\r\ndo with it whatever. I had no idea that anything of the sort was going\r\non; I knew absolutely nothing of it until they sent word to me from the\r\nrailway-office in the afternoon, and I really most sincerely regret that\r\nI am forced to take advantage of my client's--and your client's--improper\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--what do you mean?\" said Mrs. Tarbell, very much perplexed.\r\n\r\n\"What? Haven't you heard?\" cried Mr. Pope.\r\n\r\n\"Heard? What should I hear?\"\r\n\r\nFrom the depths of his green bag Mr. Pope extracted a stiff pasteboard\r\nenvelope, bursting with papers and confined by an india-rubber band.\r\nFrom this envelope he drew out a folded document, which he handed to\r\nMrs. Tarbell; and when Mrs. Tarbell clapped eyes on the document's\r\ncontents her face wore an expression before which Pope ought to have\r\nblushed for shame. The document was a release, given by Mrs. Stiles to\r\nthe railway company,--a printed form, with blanks to be filled in as the\r\nindividual case should demand; a devilish engine of cozen and covin,\r\nconstructed in cold blood by the railway company, and supplied to them\r\n(as a small line of print at the bottom of the paper showed) by\r\nDetweiler, the Blank-Book Mfr., Irving Ave. and Prime St. Mrs. Stiles\r\nhad sold herself. For one hundred and twenty-five dollars she had\r\nreleased to the railway company all the claims she might have, or could\r\nhave, upon it at any time, past, present, or future, on account of her\r\naccident. There was Mrs. Stiles's hand, there was her seal; the date was\r\nyesterday. Mrs. Tarbell read the release, and then looked at Mr. Pope.\r\nBut he did not blench.\r\n\r\n\"I regret this extremely, Mrs. Tarbell,\" he said. \"It places me in a\r\nvery unenviable position. It was done,\" he continued, with a brazen\r\nfront, \"it was done without my knowledge. My advice was not asked: the\r\ncompany acted on their own responsibility and of their own motion. It\r\nis, at best, a poor compliment to me as an officer of the road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, how did Mrs. Stiles happen to go to the company's office?\" asked\r\nMrs. Tarbell.\r\n\r\n\"I have not had a very clear account of it myself,\" said Mr. Pope,\r\nclearing his throat and putting one foot up on a chair in front of him.\r\n\"It seems, however, that Mrs. Stiles was--hem--very much frightened by\r\nmy speech, and in some way got into conversation with an agent of the\r\ncompany, a sort of bailiff to the corporation, in fact,--a man who\r\nserves their subpoenas, and looks up their witnesses, and so on, in\r\naddition to other work. This man is a sharp fellow, and, finding out\r\nwhich way the cat was jumping, he decided, I suppose, that he would try\r\nto make it jump as far as possible. Mrs. Stiles herself spoke of the\r\ncompromise, and said she regretted she had not signed it. That was\r\nenough for my man; and when Judge Measy fainted he suggested to her to\r\ntake advantage of the delay by going round to the railway company's\r\noffice with him, where, he said, of course, he would see what he could\r\ndo for her, as he had friends in the office. At the company's office he\r\nrepresented that he was acting under orders from me, the fact of the\r\nmatter being that the rogue knew that the case was going against us, and\r\nMrs. Stiles was virtually allowed to name her own sum. She took it, and\r\nsigned the release. The ingenious bailiff is in disgrace, but the\r\ncompany think they have a good thing in the release, and I, as their\r\nservant, can't refuse to obey them. _You_ understand that, of _course_,\r\nmy dear madam. But I must repeat that I'm sorry, and sorry for my own\r\nsake, that this has happened, for I should be very unwilling to have\r\nanything occur to interrupt or cloud the very pleasant professional\r\nrelations in which I have had the good fortune to find myself standing\r\ntoward you. But clients are queer cattle, as you'll soon discover. I can\r\nassure you I have been treated much worse in my day.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarbell tapped the slender paper against her open palm. Her lips\r\nwere compressed. Mr. Pope gazed at her with a queer look in his eyes.\r\nThe court-room was beginning to fill up; the jurymen were taking their\r\nplaces in the box; the public interest in Stiles _vs._ The Railway\r\nCompany had not in the least diminished.\r\n\r\n\"Your bailiff seems to be a person of extraordinary acuteness,\" said\r\nMrs. Tarbell, at length.\r\n\r\n\"He used to be a sheriff's officer,\" said Mr. Pope blandly. \"If you\r\nlike,\" he continued, \"if you choose to attack this release on the ground\r\nof fraud, I won't say a word. I think you're entitled to try it.\r\nPossibly you might prove that the company took an unfair advantage of\r\nyour client, that misrepresentations were made to her. Still, I am free\r\nto say that she seems to have signed it with her eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarbell, her lips still compressed, raised her head and looked\r\nabout the room. As she did so she caught sight of Celandine standing by\r\nthe railing. Miss Stiles's face was anxious and downcast: she gave Mrs.\r\nTarbell an appealing glance.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me one moment,\" said Mrs. Tarbell. She walked over to Miss\r\nCelandine with a rapid step. \"Did your mother know what she was doing\r\nwhen she signed this?\" said Mrs. Tarbell.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Tarbell,\" cried Miss Stiles, \"I don't know what I can say to you.\r\nI don't know how I'm ever going to beg your pardon. Ma she's in a\r\ndreadful state; and I'm sure she ought to be, the way I've been talking\r\nto her. She didn't dare to come here this morning; she was ashamed to\r\nhave you see her. And, if anything, I'm more ashamed than she, for I\r\nreally feel it more. I wonder you have the patience to listen to me.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mrs. Tarbell interrupted. \"Never mind that,\" she said. \"Did Mrs.\r\nStiles do this of her own free will, or was she tricked into it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the worst of it, Mrs. Tarbell, that's the worst of it. I can't\r\nget her to say anything but that it was her own fault. To every question\r\nI ask her, she says, 'No; it was my own fault. I just went and did it.'\r\nI can_not_ understand it. Is there no way out of it? It's really, if you\r\ndon't mind my saying so, it's on your account I ask. I haven't slept a\r\nwink all night. Ma was taken remorseful before she'd got two steps with\r\nthe money. And, do _you_ know, she was late for tea. We were in an awful\r\nstate about her; she never came home to dinner. We hunted high and low\r\nfor her. She went to Everett Square, and sat down on a bench there,\r\njust--just--penitent. Oh, I _wish_ you could _see_ her! Indeed, if it\r\nwasn't so right down dishonest it would be funny. But is there nothing\r\nto be done? Do you know how it all happened? Do you know that a man in\r\nthe company's _em_ploy--I'm sure he was--got hold of ma and just twisted\r\nher round? Couldn't you show that? And I know Mr. Pope got that man to\r\ntalk to her; I'm sure he did. Ma ain't fit to be trusted alone, that's\r\nthe amount of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you get your mother to say that she was imposed upon?\" said\r\nMrs. Tarbell, a faint gleam of hope asserting itself.\r\n\r\nCelandine shook her head sadly. \"After all,\" she said, \"it ain't so much\r\nthat she was imposed upon, but that she imposed upon herself. They took\r\nadvantage of her, true enough, that's certain; but she let them do it.\r\nWhy, Georgiana--you couldn't make her give more than five cents' worth\r\nof lemon taffy for five cents if you talked to her all day; but any\r\nthree-year-old baby on Pulaski Street can persuade ma that she's giving\r\nshort weight. I do feel so bad about it, Mrs. Tarbell. And ma lost three\r\nbuttons off her black silk yesterday, and won't have them sewed on. You\r\nmight think she was a Catholic, doing penance.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarbell turned away without saying a word.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Tarbell! Mrs. Tarbell!\" cried Celandine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tarbell turned back. A few minutes later she was walking away\r\nagain, leaving Celandine very red in the face and beginning to cry. Mrs.\r\nTarbell had refused to accept the hundred and twenty-five dollars, or\r\nany part of it, in payment of her fee.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Tarbell was coming out of the court-room--a juryman had in the\r\nmean time told her that he hoped she had got a good round sum by her\r\ncompromise: \"You would have had, say, eighteen hundred from us,\" he\r\nsaid,--as Mrs. Tarbell was going down-stairs, having just told Mrs.\r\nPegley that she--Mrs. Tarbell--did not think it necessary to communicate\r\nall her private affairs to her friends, there was Celandine waiting for\r\nher in the passage.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Tarbell,\" said Celandine hesitatingly, her eyes still red,--\"Mrs.\r\nTarbell--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Mrs. Tarbell.\r\n\r\n\"About my studying law, please, ma'am. I just wanted to say\r\nthat--that--\"\r\n\r\nUnpropitious moment. The storm gathered on Mrs. Tarbell's brow.\r\n\r\n\"I just wanted to tell you that I shall have to give it up, ma'am,\" said\r\nCelandine hurriedly. \"I'm going to marry Mr. Mecutchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you joy,\" Mrs. Tarbell said, and went on down-stairs.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WHARTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN ANNE OR FREE CLASSIC ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n     \"If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had\r\n     been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces.\"\r\n\r\n     _Merchant of Venice_, Act i., Scene ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the recognized styles of domestic architecture the position of\r\nmodern Queen Anne, or so-called Free Classic, is perhaps the most\r\ndifficult to determine. The nomenclature will assist us but little in\r\ninvestigating its art-history and constructive laws,--the term Queen\r\nAnne being as much too narrow as Free Classic is too broad. If we ask\r\nthe professors of architecture and the more learned practitioners of the\r\nart for information on the subject, we shall get vague and\r\nunsatisfactory replies. Many of the younger and more enthusiastic\r\narchitects, and the devotees of spinning-wheels, blue India teapots, and\r\ngreen crown glass will, on the contrary, unhesitatingly tell us that\r\nQueen Anne, is \"high art;\" forgetting that art had reached its lowest\r\nebb in England when William and Mary ascended the throne left vacant by\r\nthe Stuarts.\r\n\r\nWith such diversity of sentiment and reasoning, how shall we elucidate\r\nthe truth? When did Queen Anne architecture originate, who were its\r\ngreat masters, under what influence did it spring up, what causes led to\r\nits decline, and to what source may we trace its sudden and aggressive\r\nrenaissance? To the student who looks beneath the surface of fashionable\r\nart-culture the Queen Anne and Georgian periods seem almost like a\r\nmirage, where he sees dimly reflected vistas of city streets lined with\r\ntall houses built of red brick, with tiled roofs, long and narrow\r\nsash-windows painted white, and outside shutters painted green. If he\r\ngoes to the academies for information, he will be told that early Queen\r\nAnne was a feeble application of Palladian rules designed for palatial\r\nworks in marble to smaller edifices built of brick, and that late Queen\r\nAnne is simply a craze that must run its course and then sink into\r\nobscurity, as did its prototype.\r\n\r\nThis lack of historical data is the more remarkable when we consider\r\nthat the style now known as that of Queen Anne is but of yesterday. We\r\ncan follow the gradual development of styles and systems of construction\r\nand their transitions into other and later styles, from the Egyptian,\r\nSyrian, Grecian, Roman, and Byzantine, and the wondrous science of the\r\nMiddle Ages, to the wealth of Continental Renaissance, but of the style\r\nof Queen Anne we can find little more than the name. England gradually\r\nremodelled her feudal castles into the noble and picturesque\r\nmanor-houses of the Tudor kings, and her architects during the reign of\r\nElizabeth carried this somewhat fanciful, but at the same time\r\ndignified, system of construction to its utmost development. All this\r\nwill be clearly and logically explained by the professors of the\r\nacademies. They will further add that after the accession of the Stuarts\r\nthe building art gradually declined, with only a few flashes of\r\nbrilliant light in the works of Inigo Jones and Wren. The Commonwealth\r\nwas prudish in art as in manners, and the Restoration was a reign of\r\nrevel and wild license. The social worlds of William and Mary and of\r\nQueen Anne, stiff, starched, and formal, left their impress upon the\r\nbuildings of their day, which were mostly of a domestic character. The\r\nFree Classic of the Georgian reigns followed,--more refined in\r\nsentiment, delicate but severe in outline, aristocratic, but lacking\r\nstrength and boldness in composition. With the advent of the Victorian\r\nGothicists the worn-out and debased Free Classic passed into obscurity,\r\nthere to remain until the passage by Parliament of the Elementary\r\nEducation Act in 1870 brought it once more into prominence.\r\n\r\nSo much for the teachings of the academies, hampered by conservatism\r\nand constructive traditions. They see little that is good in\r\narchitecture which cannot be traced through a long line of precedents,\r\ngradually developing, as did the Gothic from the slender lancets and\r\nbold buttressing of the earlier examples to the delicate tracery and\r\nwondrous carving of Lincoln and of York. But, for all this, Queen Anne\r\nhas a history, architectural as well as political. Her short reign\r\nwitnessed the erection of a class of manor-houses and city dwellings\r\nwhich, gradually improved under the two succeeding monarchs, have formed\r\nthe basis for a revival of a remarkable character. The sudden\r\nrenaissance of Queen Anne or Free Classic architecture is the growth of\r\nbut fourteen years, and yet all classes of society have been alike\r\nfilled with aspirations for Queen An-tic houses, and for domestic\r\nappliances, and even dresses and garniture, associated with that period.\r\nThe extremely low art of the last decade of the seventeenth century has\r\nbecome the \"high art\" of to-day, and bids fair, after outgrowing the\r\neccentricities of plan and detail with which many designers have loaded\r\nit down, to develop into an honest, home-like, and thoroughly domestic\r\nstyle, in consonance with the requirements of nineteenth-century culture\r\nand refinement. England and America alike have felt the pulse-beat of\r\nthe reformers, ready and longing for a change that will be radical and\r\nhonest in its workings. Let us, then, attempt to define the position of\r\nQueen Anne architecture, historically, constructively, and aesthetically.\r\nLet us endeavor to penetrate beyond the superficial investigations of\r\nthe \"high-art\" amateur and see what may be the real value of the Queen\r\nAnne revival as a basis for the architecture of to-day, and wherein lies\r\nthe germ which may be utilized as a stepping-stone to greater\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best way to illustrate the different phases of Free Classic\r\nwill be to group the reigns of William and Anne in one period of a\r\nquarter of a century, half in the seventeenth and half in the\r\neighteenth, following the Stuart, or Jacobean, and preceding the\r\nGeorgian. At first sight there appears to be little promise of finding\r\nany genuine art in English works of this period. The Mediaeval\r\nEcclesiastical style had died out nearly two hundred years before, and\r\nduring the interval the revival of classic architecture had steadily\r\nadvanced from small and rude beginnings to a respectable position, with\r\nan academic system, so to speak, which, although it never attained in\r\nEngland the appreciation which led to its luxurious development on the\r\nContinent, found expression in many works of dignity and excellence.\r\nDuring the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. a domestic style for\r\nmanor-houses had sprung up, based upon Gothic traditions of the Tudor\r\ntype, with an admixture of the Renaissance of that day. This\r\ntransitional manner struggled through the Commonwealth comparatively\r\nundisturbed, losing by degrees all traces of its mediaeval origin. It\r\nmaintained, however, partly perhaps by the intention of its designers,\r\nbut chiefly through accident, a character of picturesqueness and\r\nhomeliness.\r\n\r\nThe great fire of 1666 desolated two-thirds of London, destroying\r\nthirteen thousand two hundred houses and eighty-nine churches, including\r\nSt. Paul's Cathedral. Down to this time the architecture of London had\r\nbeen mostly of the timber, brick, and plaster type of the Tudors. The\r\nhouses were crowded closely together, covering every available piece of\r\nground, and overhanging story above story until in many cases the\r\ndaylight was almost excluded from the narrow courts and crooked alleys.\r\nMany of these houses were built of slight materials, covered on the\r\nexterior with painted planks and on the interior with plaster. During\r\nthe reign of James I. it was enacted that the fronts of city houses\r\nshould be of brick or stone. In many cases, however, a compromise was\r\nmade in favor of heavy timber fronts, which were often richly carved and\r\nmoulded, the panels filled with bricks and plastered, the sides away\r\nfrom the street being still built of wood. In these houses we find\r\nnumerous instances of the picturesque oriels and windows adopted by the\r\ndesigners of the modern Queen Anne school.\r\n\r\nThe fire wrought a complete change in building-construction and in the\r\nhealth of the city. The plague, until then a constant visitor,\r\ndisappeared. The streets and courts were widened and much improved, and\r\nan entirely new class of buildings arose above the ruins of ancient\r\nLondon. Immediately after the fire a proclamation was issued by the\r\nking, giving instructions for certain reforms in building-construction.\r\nThis may be called the birth of the movement which later on developed\r\ninto the Queen Anne or Free Classic style of the early eighteenth\r\ncentury. In this proclamation the king commands as follows: \"In the\r\nfirst place, the woful experience in this late heavy visitation hath\r\nsufficiently convinced all men of the pernicious consequences which have\r\nattended the building with timber, and even with stone itself, and the\r\nnotable benefit of brick, which in so many places hath resisted and even\r\nextinguished the fire; and we do hereby declare that no man whatsoever\r\nshall presume to erect any house or building, great or small, but of\r\nbrick or stone; and if any man shall do the contrary, the next\r\nmagistrate shall forthwith cause it to be pulled down and such further\r\ncourse taken for his punishment as he deserves; and we suppose that the\r\nnotable benefit many men have received from those cellars which have\r\nbeen well and strongly arched will persuade most men who build good\r\nhouses to practise that good husbandry by arching all convenient\r\nplaces.\" By an act of the Common Council, passed on the 29th of April,\r\n1667, in furtherance of the king's proclamation, it is ordered, among\r\nother details, that the purveyors \"do encourage and give directions to\r\nall builders, for ornament sake, that the ornaments and projections of\r\nthe front of buildings be of rubbed bricks, and that all the naked parts\r\nof the walls be done of rough bricks neatly wrought, or all rubbed, at\r\nthe discretion of the builder.\" Permission was at the same time given\r\nto enrich buildings by variety in the forms of roofs, balconies, etc.\r\n\r\nThe urgent demand for new edifices to replace those destroyed by fire,\r\nand the necessity for observing strict economy in their erection,\r\nprecluded picturesque grouping and well-studied designs. The quaint but\r\ndangerous architecture of 1666 was rapidly replaced by rows of plain,\r\nmonotonous brick buildings, devoid of artistic merit. In Cheapside and\r\nsome of the more important thoroughfares the houses erected during this\r\nperiod were of a somewhat better character, taller, and more elegant in\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nWhile improvement in the character of domestic architecture was thus\r\nhampered by economic considerations and an intricate system of\r\nland-tenures, public and ecclesiastical architecture was greatly\r\nimproved. The rebuilding of St. Paul's Cathedral and fifty city churches\r\nby Sir Christopher Wren marks an epoch in the history of the English\r\nChurch which should not be overlooked. For the first time since the\r\nReformation the planning and general features of church edifices were\r\nmade to conform to the exigencies of the Protestant faith and a\r\nsimplified ritual. Rarely has such an opportunity for distinction been\r\nvouchsafed to any architect as that which fell to the lot of Wren; and\r\nhe proved himself equal to the task. Fergusson is my authority for the\r\nstatement that during the last forty years of the seventeenth century no\r\nbuilding of importance was erected of which he was not the architect.\r\nHad his design for a complete rebuilding of the burnt district been\r\ncarried out, London would have risen from its ashes one of the most\r\nconvenient and beautiful cities in the world. The edifices erected by\r\nWren are models of their kind. A thorough constructor, he was not less\r\nan artist in his feelings, and boldly adapted the systems of the\r\nRenaissance to the requirements of the times, modifying his details to\r\nmeet the exigencies which arose. The \"Free Classic\" of Wren was\r\ncertainly very different in conception and execution from the stiff and\r\nformal expression which we note in the works of his immediate\r\nsuccessors, several of whom were, however, men of marked ability. It\r\nwas, moreover, immeasurably superior to the classic attempts of the\r\narchitects of the middle Georgian period, who, carried away by the\r\nenthusiasm awakened by the perusal of the newly-published \"Antiquities\"\r\nof Stuart and Revett, attempted to adapt Doric porticos, hexastyle,\r\noctostyle, etc., to modern domestic architecture.\r\n\r\nWith the accession of William and Mary, England and the Continent became\r\nmore closely united. French, Spanish, and Florentine styles of dress\r\nbecame the fashion, and furniture designed in the Flemish and Dutch\r\nworkshops succeeded to the heavier examples of the preceding reigns. The\r\nopening of the China trade and the importation of Delft porcelain\r\nexerted a marked influence upon the tastes of society. An affected\r\nadmiration for Dutch topiary also became a fashion. It flourished for a\r\ntime, and reached its utmost limit of quaint absurdity in the reign of\r\nQueen Anne.\r\n\r\nArchitecture also felt the influence of the Dutch school: brick was by\r\nlaw and custom the vernacular building-material of London, as it was of\r\nthe Netherlands, and high-stepped gables with wavy lines became\r\nfrequent. Broken pediments with volute terminals were placed over doors\r\nand windows; while a slight admixture of wrought and moulded bricks was\r\noften added to give some degree of elegance and richness to the facades.\r\nThis use of moulded brick had played a prominent part in the old Tudor\r\nworks; but Parliament had placed heavy and almost prohibitory taxes upon\r\nits manufacture and that of glass, thus vitiating the taste of the\r\ndesigner by the necessity for studying strict economy in construction.\r\nThe manor-houses erected during the reigns of William and Anne are of a\r\ndifferent type: they are bold and massive, picturesque in outline, and\r\nsemi-classic in detail.\r\n\r\nThrough the Georgian reigns and that of William IV. the taste for Free\r\nClassic continued, gradually becoming more debased, with a few feeble\r\nattempts at a revival of mediaeval work, as shown by Walpole at\r\nStrawberry Hill; while in the cities the schools of Nash and Wyatt were\r\nstuccoing the honest brick-work of their street-fronts into bad\r\nimitations of Roman palaces. This called forth such epigrams as,--\r\n\r\n  Augustus of old was for building renowned,--\r\n  For of marble he left what of brick he had found;\r\n  But is not our Nash a still greater master?\r\n  He found London brick, and will leave it plaster.\r\n\r\nThe earlier years of Victoria's reign were marked by aspirations for a\r\nbetter state of things, and discussions between the rival schools of\r\nClassicists and Mediaevalists. The latter carried the day, and, after an\r\nheroic struggle and many failures, England awoke from her long lethargy,\r\nto find herself the possessor of a noble architecture, a true exponent\r\nof ecclesiastical art and tradition, although confessedly far from\r\nperfect when applied to domestic buildings. For these latter edifices\r\nthe old manor-houses, with their many mullioned windows and Tudor\r\narcuation, formed the basis for design, and machicoli, turrets, and open\r\ntimber roofs became the fashion for country-houses; but the city\r\ndwellings were erected in a style that was a compromise between the\r\nGeorgian and the semi-Gothic, the most difficult problem being to\r\nreconcile the double hung sash with the pointed arches of mediaeval\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\nEnglish architecture was in this uncertain and transitory state when, in\r\n1870, Parliament passed the Elementary Education Act. This was an\r\nopportunity long waited for, and the architects seized upon it with\r\navidity. The natural desire was to give to the school-buildings a\r\ncharacter distinctively their own, simple in plan and construction, with\r\nbut little architectural display, and built of the vernacular\r\nconstructive material of English cities,--red brick. Moulded brick could\r\nnow be procured in abundance, the tax having been removed by Parliament\r\nin 1850. Such was the beginning of modern Queen Anne architecture. From\r\nsmall beginnings it has developed into an harmonious and well-defined\r\nsystem of domestic building, very different in its better phases from\r\nthe stiff and starched appearance of its prototypes, being marked by\r\nbreadth and freedom of treatment, and in many cases by great richness of\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe architects of the United States soon caught the enthusiasm of their\r\nEnglish brethren, and the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 served to\r\nintensify the feeling of patriotism. If Queen Anne architecture is dear\r\nto Englishmen, it should be doubly so to us. In England the history of\r\nbuilding may be traced back for centuries, style following style in\r\nregular sequence, one growing out of and interwoven with another. With\r\nus the case is different. The early colonists landed in America when\r\nJacobean architecture was at its best, but they could give little\r\nthought to style or detail. Protection from the elements and savage foes\r\nwas their first requirement. Later, when they could give more attention\r\nto architecture as an art, Queen Anne ruled the popular taste, and our\r\ncolonial mansions were built and decorated under the influence which\r\nsurrounded the thought and literature of the time. Queen Anne or early\r\nGeorgian is, therefore, our starting-point in architectural history. It\r\nis well to revive a taste for its quaint and home-like character, not\r\nmerely for its own sake, but as a stepping-stone to something better and\r\nmore enduring in the future.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly glance at the various constructive systems embraced\r\nin what is to-day known as Queen Anne architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn the sudden renaissance of Palladian detail and Dutch planning, known\r\nunder the generic title of Queen Anne, we can distinctly trace the\r\ninfluence of three systems of construction. First in dignity, as in age,\r\nstands the cottage or old English style, claiming descent from the heavy\r\nTudor mansions of rude stone, rough hewn timber, and white concrete\r\nfilling, usually termed \"magpie work,\" from the startling contrast\r\nbetween their white panels and tarred timbers. Of these old mansions\r\nnumerous examples still remain: they were, for the most part, erected\r\nduring the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but in a few instances a\r\nmuch earlier date may be assigned. Their construction is of the most\r\nsubstantial character, and consists in great part of oak frame-work of\r\nlarge scantling, tenoned and pinned together, the spaces between the\r\ntimbers being filled in on both sides with a composition of well-beaten\r\nclay, straw, and chalk, which has become almost as hard as stone.\r\nEmbedded in this composition are stout oak laths, held in position by\r\ncross-sticks, to which they are bound by hazel withes, no nail being\r\nused in any part of the work. Second, Queen Anne proper, founded on the\r\ndomestic architecture of the Netherlands,--a thoroughly appropriate\r\nsystem of construction for a country where brick is the vernacular\r\nbuilding-material, and one which perhaps of all others is the most\r\neasily adapted to the requirements of city streets, narrow fronts, and\r\nlofty facades with but little projection to interrupt light and the\r\nvarious needs of traffic. Third, the style without a name, which during\r\nthe last decade has gathered to itself a heterogeneous mass of details,\r\nboth English and Continental, combined with picturesque groupings of\r\nparts to form a well-defined and pleasing whole. This system may\r\ncertainly be called \"free,\" but, as it appears to be simply a\r\nstepping-stone to something better and more in consonance with the rapid\r\ndevelopment of art and the sciences applied to domestic life, it might\r\nperhaps be well termed the Victorian Transition.\r\n\r\nThe originators of modern Queen Anne were men trained in the Gothic\r\nschool, and their watchword was \"true construction.\" This term seems to\r\nbe the most elastic and enduring of all the \"short and easily-applied\r\nrules\" of the profession of architecture. It is, however, applied more\r\nexclusively to the works of revivalists, and is frequently used in\r\nadvocacy of new methods and in condemnation of the old. The architects\r\nof the Victorian School had had it impressed upon their minds by Pugin,\r\nEastlake, and others, that true construction did not exist after the\r\nMiddle Ages,--the period of massive timber framing, heavy tables,\r\nmantel-trees, and settles, put together with wooden pins and disdaining\r\nall curves and wavy lines. For a time these professors of artistic truth\r\nwere implicitly believed, and architects came to look upon stucco,\r\nplastering, glue, veneers, broken pediments, and applied ornamentation\r\nas monstrous emanations from diseased brains, bewildered and carried off\r\ntheir balance by the great upheaval of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which a change of sentiment was achieved is one of the\r\nmost remarkable phenomena in architectural history. The worshippers of\r\n\"truth\" and the rest of the \"Seven Lamps,\" the plaster-ornament-breakers\r\nof 1860, became ten years later the loyal subjects of Queen Anne,\r\naccepting without question the tenets of Stuart and Revett, the Adams,\r\nand even of Nash and Wyatt, who carried the use of stucco and applied\r\nornamentation to the extremity of extravagance.\r\n\r\nIn studying the constructive features of the Queen Anne renaissance, we\r\nfind many examples of richly-ornamented facades, combined with affected\r\npicturesqueness and quaintness unthought of two hundred years ago. How\r\nare we to account for this change in favor of greater richness and\r\nprofusion of detail in a professed revival of the pure and simple forms\r\nof the past, and for the well-established fact, easily recognized by the\r\nstudent of architecture, that the Queen Anne brick-work of to-day owes\r\nmuch of its effectiveness, constructively and aesthetically, to the\r\nteaching of an earlier school,--that of the Tudors?\r\n\r\nDecorative brick-work, as we find it used in English architecture, is\r\nnot simply the outgrowth of the Dutch school, introduced at the\r\naccession of William of Orange. For centuries it had been employed with\r\nsuccess, particularly in Norfolk and other brick-districts. Under the\r\nTudor sovereigns, moulded and carved brick-work attained a high standard\r\nof excellence. The buildings erected during this period were frequently\r\nenriched with delicately wrought string-moulds, gable-ends, and\r\ncornices, sharp in outline, crisp and spirited in detail. Even under the\r\nStuarts, Inigo Jones and his great successor Wren executed some noble\r\nworks in this material. Unfortunately for art, Parliament in 1625\r\nestablished the rectangular dimensions of bricks, which thenceforward\r\nwere moulded on one dreary model,--a block of clay nine by four by two\r\nand one-half inches. In 1784 Parliament again interfered, and levied\r\nheavy taxes upon all bricks modelled, whether such bricks were spoiled\r\nin the baking or not. This tax was in its action almost prohibitory of\r\nany attempt at establishing a higher grade of workmanship. In the long\r\ninterval between 1625 and the repeal of the tax in 1850, workmen in clay\r\nforgot their cunning, and all desire for improvement in design had come\r\nto a stand-still.\r\n\r\nThe Victorian architects made strenuous efforts to reform so\r\ndiscreditable a state of things, and, after struggling against the\r\nignorance of labor and the conservatism of brick-masters, attained their\r\nend, and when, in 1870, the School Board Act went into operation it\r\nfound them ready, with well-trained mechanics at their command. In 1850\r\nthe revival and expansion of semi-classic architecture wrought in brick\r\nwould have been impossible; in 1870 the building world was ripe for the\r\nchange. The architects themselves, after receiving their early education\r\nunder the leaders of the stucco and plaster school of the later Georgian\r\nreigns, had had their ideas purified and refined by the art-teachings of\r\nthe Victorian Gothicists. The result was a spontaneous movement to\r\ndevelop a new system of construction, with lintelled openings and square\r\nfenestration,--Queen Anne modified and elevated by mediaeval teachings\r\nand traditions. A traditional manner, but a sensible one; a sudden\r\nfashion, if you will; a craze, but a craze upon which the architects of\r\nthe future will probably look back with satisfaction, as a bold and\r\nsuccessful step toward the solution of the vexed problem of domestic\r\narchitecture,--how to make every man's house his proper dwelling, how to\r\ncombine Sir Henry Wotton's three conditions of the art of well\r\nbuilding,--\"Commodity, Firmness, and Delight.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving England, with its highly-developed and well-understood systems\r\nof construction as they existed in the seventeenth century, let us turn\r\nto the colonial work of the early settlers of America, keeping in mind\r\nthe difficulties which surrounded them, and which not only influenced,\r\nbut determined by absolute necessities, many of the constructive\r\npeculiarities which we note in their domestic buildings.\r\n\r\nIn the English colonies of North America we find, between the first\r\nsettlement and the opening of the Revolution, three distinct periods or\r\ntypes of domestic building following each other in regular and\r\nclearly-defined sequence, from rude and massive structures of stone and\r\ntimber to carefully-constructed and artistically-designed mansions.\r\n\r\nThe first period of colonial architecture embraces the greater part of\r\nthe seventeenth century. Numerous edifices of this period may still be\r\nseen in Providence and Newport, Rhode Island, as well as in the western\r\nportions of the State. In Newport County I may instance the Governor\r\nHenry Bull house, built in 1639, the Sueton Grant house, built about\r\n1650, the Governor Coddington house, erected in 1647, and the \"Captain\r\nKid\" house, so called, on Conanicut Island. These houses show all the\r\npeculiarities of the constructive science of their day, which aimed\r\nsimply to attain solidity and protection from the elements. The chimneys\r\nand end-walls were generally built of stone, laid up as random rubble,\r\nwith mortar composed of shell lime, sand, and gravel, and flakes of\r\nbroken slate pounded fine. The sides of these buildings, and the ends\r\nabove the line of roof-plate, were of frame construction, made of heavy\r\noak timber, rudely squared, put together with treenails and boarded\r\nwith oak, usually at an angle of forty-five degrees, thus making of\r\nevery board a separate brace. This boarding was sometimes covered with\r\ncoarse stucco, as on the Bull house, or with split shingles, as on the\r\nGovernor Coddington house, put on with wrought nails.\r\n\r\n\"Whitehall,\" the home of Bishop Berkeley, and a group of old houses on\r\nThames Street at Newport, may be said to represent the second period of\r\nour colonial architecture,--_i.e._, the first quarter of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. They are entirely of frame construction, covered over the\r\nboarding with thick clap-boards, with beaded edges, put on with wrought\r\nnails, and the roofs covered with split shingles of a better class than\r\nthose previously used. In houses of this period brick began to take the\r\nplace of stone for chimneys, and the gambrel roof--a form of\r\nconstruction whose history so far has eluded the researches of the\r\nstudent--seems to have originated in the colonies: it continued in favor\r\nfor a hundred years or more, and gradually developed into a\r\nwell-proportioned architectural structure, with richly-moulded cornice\r\nand well-designed dormers. It had many advantages: the framing was\r\nsimple and strong, and the attic rooms possessed all the height and\r\nfloor-space obtainable in the modern French roof, so called, while\r\navoiding the disagreeable box-like appearance of the latter. The\r\nwindow-frames of these early eighteenth-century houses were made of\r\nplank, mortised and pinned together, the sills and caps being often\r\nmoulded and a bead run around the inner edge of the frames. The sashes\r\nwere heavy and glazed, with small squares of very inferior glass set in\r\nwide muntins.\r\n\r\nIn one of these old houses we find an attempt to modify the gambrel into\r\nthe hipped roof, a type which became highly developed in the latter half\r\nof the eighteenth century. In the earlier examples this roof, instead of\r\nbeing truncated and hipped in all around, with a railing above the crown\r\nmoulding, was simply hipped in on the lower part, being turned up at the\r\nends, forming small gables. The dwellings of this class form a\r\nconnecting-link between the second and third periods, which may be said\r\nto have commenced about 1730, when the growing commercial importance of\r\nthe seaport towns and the rapid accumulation of wealth induced a more\r\nlavish and elegant style of living.\r\n\r\nProminent among the buildings of this period may be noted in Newport the\r\nHazard house on Queen Street, now Washington Square, the Vernon house\r\n(Rochambeau's head-quarters), the Ayrault house on Thames Street, the old\r\nHazard house on Broad Street, and the Gibbs house on Mill Street. But\r\nthese are only a few representative buildings taken from the many of the\r\nsame class to be found scattered through the seaboard States. The\r\ninterior arrangements were extremely simple, but the architectural\r\ndetails and ornamentation are often rich and marked by great delicacy\r\nand refinement in treatment, the _motif_ being based upon the Free\r\nClassic of the Queen Anne and Georgian reigns. The framing of these\r\nbuildings is more systematically put together than in the earlier\r\nexamples. The great beams crossing the ceilings, and the\r\nsupporting-posts and hanging knees, are surfaced and beaded, instead of\r\nbeing rough-hewn with an axe. The fireplaces are often surrounded with\r\nDutch tiles held in place by brass bands. The locks and door-trimmings\r\nare of brass. The window-glass is larger and clearer, and is set in\r\nwell-made sashes with light muntins carefully wrought by hand. The\r\ntruncated roof is fully developed, with moulded cornices of good\r\nsection, the modillions being frequently carved with acanthus-leaves.\r\nThe entrance door-ways became the central architectural features, and\r\nare often richly carved and moulded, with pilasters surmounted with\r\nCorinthian capitals, and pediments wrought with a wealth of Palladian\r\ndetail, cut with much feeling, the muntins in the headlights being often\r\ncarved into quaint and fantastic interfacings. In a number of instances\r\nI have found that when glass panels were required in doors the glass was\r\nset as a panel and the doors framed and built around it, the moulding\r\nbeing wrought on the stiles and rails. Fortunately, the old crown glass\r\nof the period was of the toughest description, and much of it still\r\nremains. The crystal sheets of the present day would not be equal to\r\nsuch rough usage and the cross-strains of warping wood-work, even if\r\nthey did not break in the putting together. The old Hazard house shows\r\none of the best examples of a moulded and panelled chimney with which I\r\nam familiar. The roof is of a most peculiar section when viewed from the\r\ngable-end, and the cornice is heavily coved with stucco still in good\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nThe public buildings of the colonial period were mostly erected during\r\nthe era of commercial prosperity between 1730 and the passage of the\r\nStamp Act and the Boston Port Bill. Well-known examples are the Newport\r\nCity Hall, the Redwood Library, and the Jewish Synagogue, all designed\r\nby Harrison; the State-House, by Munday; Trinity Church, the oldest of\r\nall, built in 1724-25, and the Seventh-Day Baptist Church, built in\r\n1729. These buildings bear the stamp of the best English work of the\r\ntime, and evince the cultivated taste of their projectors and the skill\r\nand professional knowledge of their architects. With the exception of\r\nthe Seventh-Day Baptist Church, they are still in good condition. The\r\nlines in some places have become curved where they were originally\r\nstraight, roofs have become hollowed, and floors have settled; but the\r\nwhite-oak frames bid fair to outlive several generations of the more\r\nambitious but more slightly constructed edifices of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe colonial buildings of Providence, like those of Newport, Salem, and\r\nother New-England towns, are mostly of frame construction and of one\r\ngeneral character. A few edifices of brick, showing the details of\r\nFree-Classicism, may occasionally be met with, but the latter material\r\nseems never to have become popular or to have been generally used in\r\nordinary street-architecture. Among the more characteristic buildings\r\nof Providence and its vicinity may be enumerated, as belonging to the\r\nfirst period, the Caesar house and Green's stone castle,--the latter, at\r\nEast Greenwich, having been erected in 1660. In the Caesar house the\r\npeculiar section of the roof recalls the Hazard house at Newport,\r\nalthough the latter clearly belongs to the intermediate stage between\r\nthe second and third periods. The Witch house at Salem, 1690, recalls\r\nthe Sueton Grant house at Newport, notably in the overhanging of the\r\nfront at the line of the second floor. The Baptist Church at Providence,\r\nerected in 1774, and the Congregational Church, erected in 1816, are of\r\nthe third period. The latter edifice is post-colonial in date, but, like\r\nmany other buildings of its class, shows the conservative methods of the\r\nearly builders and their immediate followers trained under their\r\ninstruction and example.\r\n\r\nWith the early domestic edifices of Providence I am not familiar enough\r\nto allude to them by name. Many of these houses are extremely rich in\r\nsemi-classic detail both exterior and interior. The old John Brown\r\nhouse, built of brick in 1786, and now owned by Professor Gammell, is a\r\nfine specimen of the dignified and aristocratic type of the Georgian\r\nschool. The panelling, mantel-pieces, carvings, etc., are of the richest\r\ncolonial character, and are wrought with much feeling, and the doors are\r\ncrowned with pediments, a feature not generally adopted in the colonies,\r\nalthough frequently met with in contemporary English work.\r\n\r\nWe should naturally look to New York for representative works of the\r\nDutch William and Queen Anne schools, but the march of improvement and\r\ndemolition has been so universal in that city that few examples remain\r\nof the domestic architecture of New Amsterdam. Philadelphia will,\r\nhowever, supply us with much valuable material to reward our\r\ninvestigations. In the latter city the Dutch-English school became\r\nfirmly established. Many of the old buildings of the colonial period\r\nstill remain, and our attention is frequently drawn to some interesting\r\nexample while strolling through that portion of the city lying to the\r\neast of Tenth Street. These edifices, both public and domestic, are\r\ngenerally of brick construction, showing all the marked peculiarities of\r\nEnglish work of the period. The bricks are in nearly every instance laid\r\nup with the Flemish bond. The gable-ends are stepped, as in the\r\nNetherlands; string-moulds and base-courses made of moulded bricks of\r\ngood section are often met with; while the whole character and aspect of\r\ntheir facades are in unison with the conservatism and early training of\r\nthe mechanics who erected them. This conservatism and respect for the\r\nways of their predecessors still exert a powerful influence upon the\r\nbuilding-industries of Philadelphia. The masons of that city still cling\r\nwith reverence to the Flemish system of bonding,--the strongest known to\r\nthe bricklayer. The planning of the dwelling-houses is different, so far\r\nas I am conversant with them, from the system in vogue in any other\r\nAmerican city. The varied levels of floors in the \"front\" and \"back\"\r\nbuildings has been tenaciously adhered to by the designers of each\r\ngeneration. This variety in levels gives a rambling, homely effect which\r\nis very pleasing, and which is capable of being developed into the\r\nhighest expression of domestic convenience and artistic elegance of\r\nwhich our modern Queen Anne is capable.\r\n\r\nOf the public buildings, Christ Church, St. Peter's Church, Independence\r\nHall, Carpenters' Hall, and some others, represent, I think, the best\r\ntype of Queen Anne or Georgian architecture to be met with in colonial\r\nwork. Their designers seem to have been thoroughly in earnest, and the\r\ndetails are marked by conscientious adherence to the established\r\nprecedents of the time. It was this thorough knowledge of precedent as\r\napplied to mass and detail which enabled their designers to grasp boldly\r\nthe problems before them, and, while not departing from the academic\r\nsystem in which they had been trained, to infuse into each separate\r\nbuilding which they erected a dignity and an individuality of its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nAESTHETIC QUALITIES.\r\n\r\nHaving thus followed Queen Anne architecture through the various phases\r\nof its development, it remains only to refer to its claim to artistic\r\nexcellence, and answer, if possible, the question frequently asked: Is\r\nQueen Anne \"high art\"?\r\n\r\nAs a basis for the discussion of so intricate a subject, I will first\r\nendeavor to establish the underlying principles of good architecture,\r\nusing the word style in its broadest sense, expressive of elegance,\r\nfitness, and artistic truth,--style proper and style as defined by the\r\nantiquarian being two distinct things. It has been argued, and with some\r\nshow of reason, that the origin of all beauty is in utility; but in\r\narchitecture, which has other objects besides the gratification of the\r\neye, or even of the understanding, it must be conceded that art holds\r\nthe second place.\r\n\r\nTwo thousand years ago, Vitruvius laid down the basis of good\r\narchitecture: First, order, method, and regularity; second, fitness of\r\narrangement, general disposition, and contrivances adapted to locality\r\nand other circumstances; third, uniformity; fourth, proportion,--being\r\nthe relation of parts or quantities by which harmony and grace are\r\nobtained; fifth, character,--which dictates the special aspect of the\r\nwork according to its purpose; sixth, analogy,--consisting in those\r\nresemblances and ideal significances which assimilate the works of man\r\nto those of nature; seventh, economy,--not merely the vulgar economy of\r\nthe purse, but that which combines utility with beauty, admitting\r\nnothing superfluous and allowing nothing to be overlooked. Sir Henry\r\nWotton tells us, in the quaint old English of his day, that in\r\narchitecture, as in all operative arts, \"the end is to build well.\"\r\nOther writers have alluded to architecture as the \"politeness of\r\nbuilding,\" and as \"the art of building with expression.\" The fundamental\r\nlaw which should govern the preparation of an architectural design is\r\nthus happily expressed by Roscoe: \"Utility and beauty are bound together\r\nin an indissoluble chain; and what the great Author of nature has\r\njoined together let no man put asunder.\"\r\n\r\nWill the \"Free Classic\" of the Queen Anne reformers bear the test of a\r\ncritical comparison with the \"seven lamps\" of Vitruvius or the dictum of\r\nRoscoe? are such designs true exponents of \"high art,\" and do they meet\r\nthe requirements of the complex and artificial life of to-day? I propose\r\nto confine my investigations to the style of domestic buildings,\r\necclesiastical and municipal edifices being usually and by general\r\nconsent designed in a broader and more masculine manner, their _motifs_\r\nbeing deduced from mediaeval sources or from the rich and dignified\r\nRenaissance of Continental Europe.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that America received her colonial methods of building\r\ndirectly from England; but here the connection ceases, except in\r\nsentiment; and a careful comparison of a number of English and American\r\ndesigns for country-houses will, I think, sustain the assertion that in\r\nreviving a taste for Queen Anne composition the architects of the two\r\ncenturies have adopted different ideals as to the logical present and\r\nfuture development of their eclectic system. In short, the situation may\r\nbe summed up in the query, How \"Free\" may our Classic become and not\r\noffend good taste and common sense?\r\n\r\nThe Englishman, naturally conservative, clings rigidly to the old\r\nsystems of domestic planning, and, although varied and often enriched in\r\ndetail, the exterior of his Queen Anne houses is, in the generality of\r\ncases, simply a reflection of earlier works designed for the School\r\nBoard of London. The planning of these houses is irregular in the\r\nextreme, symmetry and balance of parts are ignored, and the\r\ncommunication between the various apartments is complicated and often\r\ntortuous. Their long and narrow corridors, and the infrequent use of the\r\nfurnace or steam-coil as a means for procuring an equitable diffusion of\r\nheat, necessitate the screening of doors by placing them in\r\nout-of-the-way angles and around corners, to prevent draughts. The\r\nhumid climate of England renders the veranda objectionable, and the\r\nwindows, rarely fitted for blinds, are grouped together and divided by\r\nlight and graceful mullions,--a relic of Tudor practice.\r\n\r\nThe American architect starts upon his revival with less precedent and\r\nconservatism either to assist or to hinder him. He can therefore adopt\r\nany system he pleases, or, by combining several styles, compose a\r\nthoroughly eclectic design; and he is apt to take full advantage of his\r\nopportunities, for his \"Free Classic\" is free indeed.\r\n\r\nNo style of domestic architecture can be good or partake of \"high-art\"\r\nqualities that cannot be claimed as a true exponent of the family and\r\nsocial life of the period to which it owes its birth and development. A\r\nwhimsical fashion in dress, in equipages, or in the etiquette of society\r\nmay be tolerated without injury to the national advancement. Such\r\nfashions are transitory, springing suddenly into notice and as rapidly\r\npassing into oblivion. With architecture it is different: here follies\r\nare wrought into durable form. We see an ultra Queen Anne house of\r\nto-day, and its quaintness and odd conceits attract our fancy. We put up\r\nwith its manifest incongruities and inconveniences, and for a time all\r\ngoes well. But when we tire of four-by-four-inch fenestration, glazed\r\nwith rough cathedral-glass, the lines of the tower several inches off\r\nthe vertical and bulged in the centre to give the effect of age, the\r\nrough and massive walls--of lath and plaster--glittering with broken\r\nglass, the ceilings so low that we are unable to have chandeliers to\r\nlight our rooms, rendered gloomy by artificially-darkened walls and\r\npanelling, what are we to do? If the house is well built, it should be\r\nin better heart and condition one hundred years hence than the colonial\r\nmansions erected prior to 1760 are to-day. These colonial mansions,\r\nplanned and built for the wealthy merchants of the seaboard towns, may\r\nwell command our admiration and careful study, but, as a rule, they are\r\nentirely unsuited to the domestic life of to-day, and their construction\r\nis faulty and badly conceived when viewed in the light of modern\r\npractice. They should be respected and studied, because they are true\r\nexponents of art-building, in that they show in every line and moulding\r\ngood common sense,--the use of materials according to the best ability\r\nand knowledge possessed by the artisans who erected them, and a sturdy\r\nmanhood which wrought by main strength artistic works out of crude\r\nmaterials with slender mechanical appliances. A study of these old\r\nbuildings seems to bring before us something of the mental strength of\r\nthe men who erected them,--men who were fully up to and even ahead of\r\ntheir time, who aimed to do their best, and what they did was good. Such\r\nbeing the case, are we to suppose that had the colonial architects and\r\nbuilders continued in practice down to our own time they would have gone\r\non in the old way, or, rather, behind their own best period of\r\nconstruction to the time when beams were hewn out with an axe and left\r\nas large as possible, to reduce the labor to a minimum? No; they were\r\ntoo advanced in sentiment for such weakness, and would no doubt ere this\r\nhave developed a sensible and correct national style of domestic\r\nbuilding, founded upon colonial precedent, but taking into consideration\r\nall the advances in science and art and, above all, machinery, which,\r\nalthough decried by the \"high-art\" amateur, has done much to improve the\r\nart and science of American building.\r\n\r\nThe advanced Queen Anne designer takes a different view of the case. He\r\ntells us in all seriousness and with much enthusiasm that the domestic\r\nbuilding of the colonists was far in advance of modern work, both in its\r\npicturesque aspects and its home-like comfort. He points to the huge\r\nbeams and hanging knees which support the floors, their rudely-chamfered\r\nedges dubbed into shape with an axe, as evidence of the thought and\r\nskilful manipulation of the artificer, the sashes with muntins an inch\r\nand a half in width, glazed with coarse and greenish glass, and the\r\nmouldings, all hand-made, showing the wavy lines and irregular sections\r\ninseparable from rude hand-work, and then triumphantly asks, \"Can your\r\nboasted machinery turn out such work as that?\" I answer emphatically,\r\nNo, it cannot; and for this we should be thankful. The colonial\r\nmechanics well understood the spirit of Sir Henry Wotton's apt saying,\r\n\"In architecture, as in all other operative arts, the end is to build\r\nwell.\" Would such men have spent their time in hewing out beams of oak\r\nten or twelve inches square by main strength and patience if they had\r\npossessed the circular saw driven by steam-power? The weight of these\r\nhuge beams, of badly-proportioned section, forced to support an overplus\r\nof width with comparatively small depth, wrought serious injury to their\r\nbuildings,--settling floors, irregularly hollowing roofs and\r\nridge-lines, and doing far more than time in rendering these old\r\nmansions picturesque and quaint \"suggestions\" for a revival of \"high\r\nart.\" It seems probable that the workmen of the past would have been the\r\nfirst to welcome the advent of machinery and make use of its wide\r\nadaptations. At all events, they would never have stooped to the level\r\nof the ultra Queen Anne revivalists, who, in striving after the\r\npicturesque, have often set well-studied construction at defiance.\r\n\r\nIn this search after quaintness and picturesque effects roofs and\r\nridge-lines are hollowed out with great labor, walls are made to bulge\r\nby nailing on furrings beneath the boarding, clear sheet-glass, easily\r\nprocured of any dimensions, is voted \"so inartistic,\" and the green\r\ncrown glass and bull's-eyes are taken from some venerable farm-house,\r\nwhere they fitly belonged, to fill the irregular fenestration of a\r\nmodern parlor.\r\n\r\nWhat is the logical sequence of so anomalous a state of domestic\r\narchitecture? Shall we sand our floors, and design chairs with high\r\nbacks to break off the draughts from our rattling sashes, from which we\r\nhave removed the cords and weights? abandon the equable temperature\r\nthroughout our dwellings for individual fires unassisted by the furnace\r\nor steam-coil? revert to the moderator or carcel lamp, casting a dim\r\nlight over a radius of a few feet and entirely below the level of the\r\neye, and place on our outer doors the old brass knockers to awaken the\r\ndenizens of a whole square with their noisy reverberations?\r\n\r\nI think I may safely assert that such designs and architectural fashions\r\nare not the exponent of \"high art;\" and, while they may please for a\r\ntime a people always alive to novelty, they will ultimately be set\r\naside, on the ground of their unworthiness when measured by the standard\r\nof common sense. It has been said of common sense applied to building\r\nthat \"when and wherever architecture has been practised as a living art,\r\nas an outgrowth of the wants of the people who practise it, especially\r\nin those periods which are generally reckoned by the educated as the\r\npurest, this quality is everywhere recognized. From the rock-hewn cave\r\nand rude hut to the stateliest edifice, this principle will be found to\r\nexist; and, though a common-sense building may have no artistic beauty,\r\na building which sets common sense at defiance will fail to please the\r\nintelligent observer.\"\r\n\r\n  Something there is more needful than expense,\r\n  And something previous e'en to taste,--'tis sense,\r\n  Good sense, which only is the gift of heaven,\r\n  And, though no science, fairly worth the seven.\r\n\r\nCritical writers, in reviewing architectural publications, have\r\nfrequently remarked that the authors of such works, particularly those\r\nwhich profess to deal with the aesthetical side of the profession, while\r\nseverely censuring the prevailing taste for what they term \"debased\r\nart,\" and denouncing all methods adopted since the birth of the\r\nRenaissance, rarely offer us any formulas by following which we may\r\nadvance the tone and sentiment of architecture. When they do offer any\r\nadvice, it is too often in vague terms, scarcely to be understood by the\r\ngeneral reader. Thus, one tells us that to follow taste alone is a\r\ndelusion, and that architecture, to be worthy of its name, should be a\r\nlogical development of the constructive sciences based upon man's\r\nnecessities and the requirements of social life. In short, instead of\r\noffering a grammar of architecture suited to the wants of the general\r\nand unprofessional reader, these authors offer theoretical reasoning of\r\nan advanced order; instead of art-instruction, severe censures upon\r\nexisting forms. The system by which architectural students are educated\r\nand prepared for the duties of professional life has much to do with\r\ntheir lack of readiness in formulating in after-years practical theories\r\nfor the improvement of their art.\r\n\r\nBut the establishment of architectural schools at the Boston Institute\r\nof Technology, at Columbia College, and at Champagne, Illinois, with\r\nwell-trained and enthusiastic professors at the head of each, and\r\ncarefully-selected corps of assistants, is already doing much toward an\r\nimprovement in students themselves, and in raising the standard of\r\nAmerican architecture as a profession in the eyes of society. This\r\nstudent-system must in time create a body of men, well educated,\r\nenthusiastic, and bound together by an _esprit de corps_ hitherto almost\r\nunknown among the great body of practising architects. The dictum passed\r\nby such a body upon the art and science of building will be received\r\nwith respect by the laymen who employ them, and American architecture,\r\nin its better phases, will receive an impetus and a nervous strength in\r\nconstruction and composition which at present we find exemplified only\r\nin the scattered works of a few highly-trained practitioners. So far we\r\nhave had in this country no fixed standard by which the educated\r\narchitect may be tried and his professional position established. Unlike\r\nthe practice of law and medicine, the field is free to all, and previous\r\ntraining is not required. In France, where the educational probation is\r\nlong and severe and the rewards of success certain, the graduates of the\r\nschools are few in number compared with the lists of new names\r\nconstantly appearing in the columns of our city directories with the\r\ndesignation of \"architect.\" In America, young men, ambitious and anxious\r\nto succeed, after a few months spent in study and in copying drawings\r\nin some prominent office, set up for themselves. They naturally drift\r\ninto the ranks of the Queen Anne designers, for the reason that their\r\nart is \"free,\" and they can jumble together\r\n\r\n  A patchwork of Japan,\r\n  And queer bits of Queen Anne,\r\n  All mixed upon the plan\r\n  Of as you like or as you can.\r\n\r\nOne of the most zealous of the English Queen Anne revivalists has made\r\nthe candid confession of the real weakness under the apparent strength\r\nof the movement, in stating that \"it is a bad style for students to cut\r\ntheir teeth upon.\" If it is a bad foundation for the education of\r\nstudents, certainly it must be bad for the stability and beauty of their\r\nfuture works.\r\n\r\nNothing that I have seen so cleverly portrays the young and \"high art\"\r\narchitectural aspirant as the delineation of a character in a novel\r\npublished in England under the title of \"The Ambassador Extraordinary,\"\r\nand said to have been written by an eminent architect. With unsparing\r\npen the author sketches a character, Georgius Oldhausen by name, F.S.A.,\r\nprofessor of architecture of a very advanced order. The work is well\r\nexecuted, and we can almost see before us the architect who, disdaining\r\nsuch insignificant matters as good planning, stability of construction,\r\nand convenient disposition of parts, claims to be an artist pure and\r\nsimple, and, leaving practical matters entirely out of the question,\r\ngoes in heavily for the picturesque and pure mediaeval, Queen Anne, or\r\nJacobean, as the case may be. Let us follow him as he conducts a friend\r\nover a church and conventual establishment in course of construction.\r\n\r\n\"Your rooms,\" says Monsignore, \"seem to me to be made almost as\r\nuncomfortable as they possibly can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course!\" exclaims the astonished artist, fixing his glass\r\nsomewhat indignantly in his eye. \"What you call uncomfortable I call\r\nquaint.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very possibly I should call it the same; but, my dear sir, _cui bono_?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cui bono!_\" answers the architect contemptuously. \"That's what all\r\nmodern people say; that's the horrible mistake of the whole modern\r\nworld. We shall never recover the tone of the old men till we get rid of\r\nsuch jargon. Now, just for an instant, imagine the fathers of this abbey\r\nof ours going in for wash-hand-basins!\"\r\n\r\nHe drops his eye-glass in sheer dismay at such an idea. They next visit\r\nthe refectory. Master Georgius here excels himself. \"I'm going in for\r\ndoing it inside in red brick, and vaulting it in red brick too, with\r\nblack diaper-patterns all over, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How pretty!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" (dropping his glass.) \"The diapers will be quite\r\nirregular, and full of what you would very likely call mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sort of intentional accidents, George.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; not a bad term. And then the joints will be all raked out roughly,\r\nand the brick-work smeared, you know. I have quite a new idea about\r\nthat. I mean to go in for letting the workmen have the use of all the\r\nrooms, with liberty to smudge them as much as they like; and so at the\r\nend we shall have a sort of antique effect, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will be dirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may call it dirt,\" says Georgius, refixing his eye-glass. \"I call\r\nit art. And there will be marks here and there where the fellows have\r\nlighted fires, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And caricatures on the walls, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. I shall go in for that very much. I shall offer a prize for\r\nthe quaintest. I'll have them done with a brush of paint, you know, or\r\nscratch them with a screw-driver, and so on. I call that real art.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, George.\"\r\n\r\n\"And smudges of candle-smoke everywhere, and grease, and all that sort\r\nof thing. Well, here's the dormitory; that's in yellow brick, with white\r\nones, and red ones, and so on, intermixed at random. Magnificent!\"\r\n\r\nThe tower he proposes to treat in an equally artistic manner. \"I shall\r\ngo in for building it quite rough on purpose, and have it washed over\r\nwith something--that's a matter of detail, you know--to produce fungus,\r\nor moss, or lichens, or whatever you choose to call it; and I shall\r\nplant things in the crevices as we go up,--wall-flowers, and houseleek,\r\nand ferns, and couch-grass, and all that kind of thing, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is all that for?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it all for?\" says Master Georgius, dropping his glass. \"Why,\r\nwhat could it be for? To give authenticity to the tower, of course.\"\r\n\r\nWith all this so-called aestheticism and crude speculation upon the\r\nproper development of architecture as a fine art, I believe the\r\nreformers of the Queen Anne school have honestly attempted to improve\r\nand elevate the standard of our domestic buildings. At all events, they\r\nhave brought into the ranks of the profession life and nerve, elements\r\nabsolutely necessary to an honest development of art-methods. The\r\nsentiment for art pure and simple will gradually expand into a greater\r\nveneration for the scientific elements of their professional career, and\r\nthe necessity of clearly demonstrating to the uneducated comprehension\r\nof mechanics the practicability of their designs will induce those\r\nhabits of thought and investigation which, if honestly pursued, will\r\nelevate the standard of professional attainments. As a natural result,\r\ntheir designs when executed will give us edifices artistic in conception\r\nand detail, well planned, and built by the best-known methods of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe Queen Anne revival, viewed apart from the incongruities which have\r\nbeen engrafted upon it, is a movement of great interest to the\r\narchitectural fraternity. Although a worn-out and debased art was the\r\nfoundation of this renaissance, the movement has given to us, in the\r\nworks of its best masters, much that is beautiful and honest in theory\r\nand in real domestic comfort. It may be said to be the picturesque art\r\nof a hitherto unpicturesque time and people. Let us, then, cultivate the\r\nprinciples of Free-Classicism honestly and logically, striving to\r\nsecure the best results from our studies and the works of our\r\npredecessors; but do not let us be carried away by our love for\r\narchaeology and attempt to make our Queen Anne houses of to-day simply a\r\nreflex of those of the early eighteenth century. If we attempt such\r\npurism we must fail signally as constructors and as artists.\r\nArchitecture, to be a living art, must press forward and keep pace with\r\nthe advance of civilization, combining and utilizing all the varied\r\nresources at its command, and aiming to meet all the public and domestic\r\nrequirements of a complex and artificial state of civilization. To\r\nAmericans, Queen Anne or early Georgian is the starting-point of\r\narchitectural history. Let us, then, take it as our standard, the Alpha\r\nof our profession, and aim to emulate the old masters in their endeavors\r\nto do their best with the small means at their command. Let us so design\r\nour modern buildings as to obtain the best results from diversified\r\nindustries, almost human machinery, and the refined taste and superior\r\ncultivation of our clients, and we shall be carrying out the Queen Anne\r\nrevival more logically and with more common sense than by aiming simply\r\nto attain the quaint and picturesque aspects of earlier work, forgetting\r\nthe necessities which compelled the builders of the eighteenth century\r\nto stop short in their aspirations for a better and truer art. Let us\r\nbuild strongly, honestly, and conveniently,--eclectically if we\r\nwill,--and our modified and beautified Queen Anne will become the\r\nlogical expression of American domestic architecture. It contains the\r\ngerm of greatness and artistic truth: let us endeavor to secure that\r\ngerm, and our dwellings, enriched and beautified, will realize the idea\r\nof Skelton, who tells us of the early masters who, centuries before the\r\nadvent of Queen Anne or Free Classic architecture, were\r\n\r\n  Building royally\r\n  Their mansions curiously,\r\n  With turrets and with toures,\r\n  With halls and with boures,\r\n  Stretching to the starres;\r\n  With glass windows and barres;\r\n  Hanging about the walls,\r\n  Clothes of golde and palles,\r\n  Arras of rich arraye,\r\n  Freshe as flowers in Maye.\r\n\r\nGEORGE C. MASON, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I woke and heard the thrushes sing at dawn,--\r\n    A strangely blissful burst of melody,\r\n    A chant of rare, exultant certainty,\r\n  Fragrant, as springtime breaths, of wood and lawn.\r\n  Night's eastern curtains still were closely drawn;\r\n    No roseate flush predicted pomps to be,\r\n    Or spoke of morning loveliness to me.\r\n  But for those happy birds the night was gone!\r\n  Darkling they sang, nor guessed what care consumes\r\n    Man's questioning spirit; heedless of decay,\r\n  They sang of joy and dew-embalmed blooms.\r\n    My doubts grew still, doubts seemed so poor while they,\r\n  Sweet worshippers of light, from leafy glooms\r\n    Poured forth transporting prophecies of Day.\r\n\r\n  FLORENCE EARLE COATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOS PENSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey have been many and of a widely various character. We tried them in\r\nEngland, in France, in Italy; we tried them likewise in Germany, Sweden,\r\nand Spain, but the result of that trying was, in these last-named\r\ncountries, far more trying to our digestions and tempers than rich in\r\nsuch recollections as would add to the interest of this paper.\r\n\r\nOur first European _pension_ was, naturally, a London one. It was one of\r\nthe innumerable host in the pale realms of Bloomsbury. Like others of\r\nits kind in that region, it prided itself upon its \"connexion,\"--or,\r\nless euphemistically, its _custom_,--and made a specialty of an\r\nAustralian \"connexion,\" as the next number upon the right made a\r\nspecialty of Germans, the one upon the left of South Americans and\r\nSpaniards, the one opposite of Russians, and uncounted ones all over\r\nLondon of our countrymen. Although our house was largely frequented by\r\nAustralians, it did by no means confine its privileges to them. Like\r\nevery other London boarding-house, it was a perfect caravansary of\r\nforeigners of almost every nation and every shade of color. At one time,\r\nwith a Danish landlord and an Irish landlady, we were Norwegians,\r\nSwedes, Russians, Spaniards, Germans, Italians, and East Indians. Also\r\nwe were several Americans, as was proved one notable day. That day we\r\nheard the arrival of new-comers in the hall below. We saw not their hue,\r\nbut we recognized their cry as that of our countrypeople. We are not\r\nmadly enamoured of our countryman in foreign climes. There his least\r\nadorable qualities--his bumptiousness, his provincialism, his strident\r\ntones and \"_costume de Yank_\"--are always more strikingly conspicuous\r\nthan the chivalry toward women and the self-respecting manliness we\r\nalways recognize so emphatically in him when we return to our own land\r\nafter a prolonged absence. Hence we panted not for the dinner-hour, that\r\nshould show us the faces whose voices we recognized as to our own manner\r\nborn. That hour came, however, as all hours come to those who know how\r\nto wait. We descended to the showy table, with its floral decorations of\r\npaper, muslin, and gay paint, the ladies in the evening dress of\r\nflowers, trains, and _decolletee_ bodices which is the absurd custom of\r\npretentious London _pensions_. We glanced along the table to note the\r\nnew-comers. They were there, neatly and stylishly dressed in\r\nwalking-costumes. They were three quiet gentlemanly and lady-like\r\npersons, but their faces were Medusa-like to almost every American who\r\ngazed upon them. The foreigners looked intensely amused at this collapse\r\nof the American contingent,--all save our Danish landlord, who stared\r\nwith amazement. Next day our new-comers disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"How in the world did you _congedier_ them?\" somebody asked.\r\n\r\n\"I told them my Americans admire enough coppery Turks, South Americans,\r\nJapanese, and East Indians, but they turn to stone at sight of niggers,\"\r\nanswered Mr. Nodskou.\r\n\r\nThe line was certainly not drawn at color, for our Parsees were dusky\r\nenough, goodness knows, and them our maidens found very captivating.\r\nSeveral of them spoke no English, and it was the fascinating pastime of\r\nour English, Australian, and American girls to teach them our common\r\nlanguage. But the result was, alas, not a little confusing to our\r\nParsees.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fancy you are learning English from those Americans,\" warned\r\nBritannia. \"Their accent is horrible: they say the weather is 'fair'\r\nwhen they mean 'fine,' they call their luggage 'baggage,' and when they\r\nspeak of their travelling-boxes talk of their 'trunks,' like\r\nelephants!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be fooled by English English,\" advised Columbia: \"the accent is\r\nlike a mouthful of pudding, and when they mean to say the weather is bad\r\nthey say it is 'nawsty;' they call their rubbers 'galoshes,' their\r\ndepots 'stations,' and when they start on a journey they get their\r\n'boxes' together, like sweet-biscuit-peddlers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind what either of them say,\" quoth Miss Melbourne. \"Both are\r\nwrong. It is only we Australians, living between the two branches of the\r\nlanguage, as it were, who select the best and gobble it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What must it to say when I have such a fear, _such_ a fear, that I\r\nspeak not?\" asked one of the Parsees.\r\n\r\n\"Say you're dickey on your pins,\" laughed Australia.\r\n\r\n\"Say you feel all of a goneness,\" spoke up Columbia.\r\n\r\n\"No; that is Americanese,\" flouted Britannia: \"say you're in a beastly\r\nfunk!\"\r\n\r\nThat our Parsees improved under such tuition was somewhat remarkable.\r\nThe lingual advance of one of them was quite startling. Our young ladies\r\nhad striven to teach him \"good-by.\" One day, therefore, as the ladies\r\nwere departing from the dining-room, leaving the gentlemen to their\r\nwine, our Parsee opened the door with grave, Oriental courtesy, and,\r\nbowing to the rustling covey, said solemnly, \"By god, ladies, by god!\"\r\n\r\nDuring a political discussion in which English and Australians took\r\nchief parts, a Melbourne girl exclaimed excitedly, \"Thank goodness,\r\n_I'm_ not English!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Engleesh!\" exclaimed her neighboring Parsee. \"What are you but the\r\nsmall little brat of the mother-country?\"\r\n\r\nNot until we laughed did our grave Oriental remember that \"brat\" and\r\n\"child\" are not strictly synonymous.\r\n\r\nSaid one of our English girls afterward to me, with tact and taste\r\npre-eminently British, \"_She_ glad she is not English! Really, _I'd_\r\nalmost as soon be American as Australian.\"\r\n\r\nOur Parsees were not our only peculiar people. We Americans found quite\r\nas much food for sly laughter in the queerness of our English _habitues_\r\nas they did in ours. Our English contingent was largely feminine,\r\ntherefore, as goes without saying, very High-Church, very _devote_, and\r\nexcessively Tory, worshipping the English aristocracy vastly more than\r\nthat of celestial courts. Everybody knows the two diseases that\r\nvirulently assail young Englishwomen,--\"scarlet fever\" and \"black\r\nvomit,\"--maladies provoked by association with red-coated officers and\r\nblack-coated curates.\r\n\r\nOne of our fair Britons had the darker malady. She fasted regularly on\r\nFridays and Tuesdays. We always recognized her _jours maigres_ by the\r\nquantity of cakes and pastry we saw carried to her room just before\r\ndinner, to which dinner she came in nun-like gray silk, saintly\r\ncoiffure, with ascetic pallor on cheeks wont to bloom with roses de\r\nNinon, to dine, _a la_ Sainte Catherine or Sainte Something else, on a\r\nfew lentils or a lettuce-leaf.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday somebody asked this fair devotee to give us a certain popular\r\nbut profane piano-arrangement. She was shocked beyond measure. A few\r\nmoments' temptation, however, brought her to a compromise.\r\n\r\n\"I think there will be no harm if I play it slowly and make it as solemn\r\nas possible.\"\r\n\r\nWe smiled at the aesthetic piety of our Saint Catherine. But she did more\r\nthan smile at our national practicality when, one evening, from the gay\r\ndrawing-room we heard the clamor of a feminine arrival below:\r\n\r\n\"I won't see any rooms till I know your price. I won't stir a peg till I\r\nknow what's to pay. I've come from Chicago, where folks know what's\r\nwhat, and I'm going to do Yoorup on the cheap!\"\r\n\r\nSaint Catherine worshipped her country's aristocracy. One day Jonathan\r\nhappened to be putting on his coat in the hall, when somebody knocked at\r\nthe front door. Forgetting that the act, so natural to an American, is\r\nungentlemanly and menial in England, he opened the door himself. A\r\ncouple of young swells inquired for Saint Catherine.\r\n\r\n\"I just saw her go out,\" answered Jonathan.\r\n\r\n\"Tell her that the brothers of Lord Verisopht called,\" said the\r\nspokesman.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell her,\" spoke Jonathan; \"but, good heavens, young man, don't\r\nlords' brothers have any names of their own in this country?\"\r\n\r\nAnother day came a gorgeous individual with a bouquet to the door.\r\n\r\n\"What skion of the British nobility is that?\" asked Jonathan.\r\n\r\n\"That is Lord Blank's footman,\" replied Saint Catherine.\r\n\r\n\"My! Well, whose footman is _that_?\" continued her interlocutor,\r\npointing to a less gorgeous person holding the reins.\r\n\r\n\"That is Lord Blank,\" answered Saint Catherine loftily.\r\n\r\n\"Sakes alive! Does that goose of a lord think he will stand any chance\r\nwith the girls when he takes such a howling swell as _that_ around with\r\nhim?\" asked simple Jonathan.\r\n\r\nTo this question Saint Catherine deigned no reply, having, perhaps,\r\nremarked the wicked twinkle of Jonathan's eye.\r\n\r\nOne of our _pensionnaires_ objected very much to the American language.\r\n\"It is principally slang,\" she said. This lady, no longer young, had\r\nbeen three times upon the eve of marriage, had had three bridal dresses,\r\nhad countermanded three wedding-feasts. She was heiress at that time to\r\nthe fifty thousand pounds she has since inherited, and the persistent\r\nfailure of her matrimonial endeavors surprised us all.\r\n\r\n\"It is because Monsieur mon Pere is perfectly addled on the matter of\r\nsettlements, and rowed with every one of my _fiances_,\" she explained.\r\n\r\nShe said one day, \"The gov'nor has done me out of a guinea of my\r\nallowance this week. He's a first-class _Do_!\"\r\n\r\nAnother time, \"The mater and I prefer to live in our own house, but the\r\ngov'nor won't hear to it. He prefers 'diggin's' where he can always have\r\nhis whist.\"\r\n\r\nSome time after our sojourn in Bloomsbury \"diggin's\" we found ourselves\r\nin a Continental _pension_, the very reverse of this in every respect.\r\nIt was a Parisian _pension bourgeoise_, but one entirely away from every\r\nhaunt of foreigners as well as from foreign influences,--a _pension_ as\r\nFrench as French could be, where we were not merely the only foreigners\r\npresent, but the only ones who had ever penetrated there.\r\n\r\nIt was a large white house, standing in its own grounds, not far from\r\nthe Bois de Vincennes, pre-eminently a _pension bourgeoise_, and without\r\npretensions higher than the widows of shopkeepers and the relicts of\r\nsmall government employees that formed its support. Not counting\r\nourselves, there were twenty Relicts and one Maiden, all with handsome\r\nincomes and diamonds, but with the habit of running far and wide upon\r\nthe open boulevard in caps, loose sacques, and list slippers, and of\r\nboasting of the cheap bargains they made in stockings and gowns. Their\r\ntoilets were always _tout ce qu'il y a de plus bourgeois_, their\r\nconversation ran upon public scandals, private gossip, and fluctuations\r\nof trade (almost all of them had kept shop with their departed\r\nconsorts), their reading was Paul de Kock's novels and the _feuilletons_\r\nof \"Le Petit Journal.\" The youngest widow was fifty, the Maiden\r\nninety-and-nine. The latter was daughter of a man who had been\r\n_concierge_ of the Tuileries during the reign of Charles X. She was\r\ndusky and shrivelled as any daughter of the Pharaohs, but her faculties\r\nwere marvellously preserved and her memory rich with interesting\r\npersonal gossip of a former period. We Americans should have delighted\r\nto draw upon that memory, but one thing hindered us: that was the\r\ninsatiable, indomitable, unparalleled coquetry of our ancient Maiden.\r\nShe would never talk with any woman when any man was in the room. She\r\ndescended to the stuffy little _salon_ only in the evening, when the\r\nRelicts were gathered to their gambling for sous and the atmosphere was\r\nan imitation of the Black Hole of Calcutta. She descended _en grande\r\ntenue_, the grandest ever seen there, frizzled, jewelled, and muffled\r\nto the throat in fleecy clouds of white wool. She came all quirks and\r\nquivers, all flutters and smiles, for there she met our only\r\nMonsieur,--Monsieur Boulanger, our landlord. She invariably took her\r\nseat beside him, and devoted quirks and quivers exclusively to him,\r\ntapping him with her fan, calling him \"_Mechant! mechant!_\" \"_farceur_,\"\r\nor \"_quel diable d'homme!_\" twittering and carolling in her old broken\r\nvoice, like a senile canary dreaming of its far-off youth. M. Boulanger\r\nwas of peasant origin and appearance, gray-bearded and gray-haired, and\r\nclumping always in _sabots_ over the stone floors, except in the _salon_\r\nin the evening. But her eyes were only for him; and the only occasion on\r\nwhich any of her own uninteresting sex had her attention was when Madame\r\nBoulanger pouted and pretended to be jealous, or some Relict showed\r\npique that our only Monsieur was monopolized by our only Maiden. Then\r\nshe smiled archly, cooed sweetly, and arched her ancient neck with\r\nvisible triumph.\r\n\r\nBefore we left the _pension bourgeoise_ our front door was hung with\r\nheavy black curtains, and our Maiden passed forth into the broad day for\r\nthe first time in ten years. She went out unsmiling, uncooing, without\r\nflutter or quirk, and no date upon her pine coffin, for with her last\r\nbreath she had forbidden it.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody need know that I have lived more than fifty years,\" she\r\nmurmured; \"and don't let Monsieur Boulanger look at me when I am dead.\"\r\n\r\nOne of our widows--Madame Notte--was almost stone-deaf. She was a\r\ndwarfish creature, passionately fond of cards, waxing into terrible\r\ntempers over them, and with only one interest in life,--worshipful love\r\nof her only son, a not too beautiful _citoyen_ of fifty. This son fell\r\nill and died. Poor Madame Notte knew of his illness, but not of its\r\ndanger and final end. It was thought best to keep from her the knowledge\r\nthat she was childless, lest the shock should be too great for her frail\r\nstrength. She was told he had gone to Italy for his health; and when\r\nhis widow and daughters came twice each week to visit her, they left\r\ntheir weeds at home, came in a close carriage in their gayest attire,\r\nand laughed and talked to her blithely with heavy hearts. All about the\r\npoor old mother we talked openly and freely of her loss and our pity,\r\nand she sat as unwitting as stone of it all. But when we put our mouths\r\nto her ear and asked for her son, a beautiful change always dawned upon\r\nthe leaden countenance. \"He has gone away,\" she invariably\r\nsmiled,--\"gone to a better country, where it is always summer. When I\r\nsee him again he will be well, quite well.\" She, too, passed under the\r\nheavy black curtains that winter; and from our hearts we prayed that all\r\nwas well with them in that better country where it is always summer.\r\n\r\nOne of our Relicts prided herself upon her English, and criticised ours.\r\n\"They speak English fairly well: I can _understand_ them,\" I once heard\r\nher say of us to a group of Relicts in the garden; \"but of course they\r\nspeak only a _patois_: they are Americans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why say you always to your infant, 'Hurry, my darling'?\" she asked one\r\nday. \"The pure Englishes says always, ''Urry, me darlink.'\" Madame had\r\nacquired her English from her defunct lord, a commercial traveller from\r\nLancashire.\r\n\r\nOne day, glancing at an envelope I had just addressed, she remarked,\r\n\"_Eh bien!_ you Americans are very like English, after all. In England\r\nthe last name of almost every monsieur is 'Esq.'!\"\r\n\r\nAnother day she sweetly remarked, \"This knife has very bad bladders.\"\r\n\r\nAs knives in our country are not generally endowed with that physical\r\npossession, I could only stare my astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, I see! It is an _English_ word, and you do not understand it. It\r\nmeans _lame_.\"\r\n\r\nBy which I discovered that had she spoken our transatlantic _patois_ she\r\nwould have said \"_blades_.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one of our Relicts had her private sitting-room attached to her\r\nbed-room, the house having been built expressly to suit the demands of\r\n_bourgeois_ widows with fortunes. Thus our _salon_ was of very little\r\naccount until after dinner, when our widows, instead of returning to\r\ntheir own rooms, the garden, or the boulevard, where they spent the day,\r\nherded together around card-tables almost as closely as sheep in a pen.\r\nThe _salon_ was not intended for daytime use; in the bitterest weather\r\nit had no fire until evening, and it had but a single window, which\r\nlooked out upon the pavement of a well-like court arched over, three\r\nstories above, by a handkerchief bit of sky. Very little light or air\r\never entered the box-like place; during the day its atmosphere was stale\r\nand heavy, at night almost fetid. Whenever we ventured to pass an hour\r\nthere our struggle was always against fate. Slyly we would leave the one\r\ndoor an inch ajar, or surreptitiously unclose the window a fraction as\r\nmuch. Scarcely, however, had we begun to congratulate ourselves upon\r\nsuccess when half a score of antique roses flaunted and flared, and the\r\ndeath-knell of sly hopes sounded with echoed and re-echoed cry: \"_Mon\r\nDieu!_ I smell air!\" \"_Mon Dieu!_ Smell you not air?\" \"_Mon Dieu!_ Smell\r\nwe not air?\" \"_Mon Dieu!_ Smells she not air?\" \"_Mon Dieu!_ Smell they\r\nnot air?\"\r\n\r\nAlmost all our _veuves_ had children and grandchildren in Paris, and we\r\nwere continually surprised to see the mundane elegance of these younger\r\nbranches of our withered old trees. It showed the usual history,\r\nhowever, of _bourgeois_ parents who had worked steadily, lived humbly\r\nand economically, to gather _dots_ for their daughters and open careers\r\nfor their sons, to see them thus rise to positions in life far above\r\ntheir parents. Every day some of these younger branches came to our\r\nhouse in handsome carriages and toilets; and indeed on some days the\r\nnumber of elegant visitors who rang at our door gave the impression of a\r\ngay reception _a la mode_ rather than of the ordinary visitors of a\r\n_pension bourgeoise_ at Saint-Maude.\r\n\r\nOne of our Relicts was decidedly less _bourgeoise_ and more _paysanne_\r\nthan any of the rest. She was round as a ball, seventy years of age, and\r\ndressed always in short gray petticoats, black short-gown, and close\r\nwhite cap. Madame Boulanger kept close watch upon her, and tried to\r\nconfine her to the sunny, high-walled garden set with a number of round\r\nlittle iron tables, where our Relicts took their after-_dejeuner cafe_\r\non sunny days. But Madame Boulanger was not Argus-eyed, and thus we\r\noften saw Madame Leroy escape through the front door and roll like a\r\nhuge balloon along the boulevard, bent on what she called \"collecting\r\nher rents.\" The way she did it was to enter every open door and accost\r\nevery grown person she saw with the stern reproach that he was\r\nbehind-hand with his rent, and if he did not pay up by to-morrow she\r\nwould send the _huissier_ to sell him out. The poor creature was so well\r\nknown in the neighborhood that she never received rough treatment, and\r\nwas generally so thoroughly tired out by her rent-collecting as to be\r\nquite ready to return without resistance whenever one of our servants\r\nsought her. When she did not escape, and mingled with the conglomerate\r\nwidowhood of the garden (she was never permitted in the _salon_, and\r\nwent to bed with the chickens), her time was spent, hour after hour, day\r\nafter day, month after month, going from Relict to Relict, telling\r\nalways the same story,--always the same, and always a true one:\r\n\r\n\"Are you in trade? I am. My husband and I came to Paris from Normandy\r\nfifty years ago, on foot, with one hundred francs. We kept a\r\ngreen-grocery on Rue des Saints-Peres. When my husband died he left me\r\none hundred thousand francs. I go to collect my rents: will you go? Are\r\nyou in trade? I am. My husband and I came to Paris on foot,\" etc., etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOne of the most elegant of all our visitors was to this poor old Madame\r\nLeroy. She always came in an elegant landau, with liveried coachman and\r\nfootman. Her toilets were of incomparable luxury, but likewise of\r\nrestrained and cultured taste, being usually of black velvet,\r\nduchess-like laces, and queenly furs. She always went directly to this\r\nold peasant-woman's handsomely-furnished rooms, and we never saw her\r\nexcept as she descended from her carriage before the windows at which we\r\nsat. She was a tall, finely-formed, aristocratic-looking brunette of\r\nthirty-five or forty, artistically gotten up as to complexion and hair,\r\nand always smiling affectionately at the tea-kettle old figure waiting\r\nat the door to greet her. This aristocratic lady was known in the house\r\nas Madame la Princesse, and was the daughter of our ancient _paysanne_\r\nand green-grocer, whom a Slav noble had taken from a _cafe chantant_ in\r\nConstantinople to endow with his name and fortune.\r\n\r\nAnother of our _veuves_ filled her private _salon_ with cats. There were\r\nseven of them, and the odor of her premises was ancient and cat-like.\r\nThree of these cats were sans eyes, sans teeth, sans everything, and had\r\nlived with their mistress in these very rooms years before, when booming\r\nshells sped hot over the house, and fell sometimes close beside it,\r\nduring the siege of Paris.\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage to feed them?\" we asked.\r\n\r\n\"I bought slices of cat in the market and stewed them in wine,\" answered\r\nMadame Pognon. \"Wine and rice were the only things we were not stinted\r\nin. Thus I could always make a ragout for Pierre, Jean, and Jacques, and\r\nthey throve on it. But I had to keep them shut up, or they would have\r\nmade ragouts instead of eaten them.\"\r\n\r\nA characteristic of our Relicthood _en bloc_ was its idleness. I never\r\nsaw one of them with a piece of knitting or any other work in her hands\r\nduring all the weeks we were there. In fine weather they loitered and\r\nbasked in the garden, gossiping or amusing themselves with novelettes\r\ncut from the penny papers and passed from one to the other in turn. The\r\nfront door stood almost always open, and the suburban neighborhood\r\nabout it was during pleasant days largely flecked by the grave gowns and\r\nwhite caps belonging to our _pension_. Nearly all were Bonapartists (for\r\nwas not trade good during the Empire?) and found the present times sadly\r\nout of joint. Nearly all had stood behind counters or at cashiers'\r\ndesks, and had thus never learned more strictly feminine employments,\r\nand now, retired upon their _rentes_, they found time heavy upon their\r\nhands. None were conspicuously _devote_: they had never been so in their\r\nyounger days, and they were not of natures to be spiritualized by long\r\nfamiliarity with life. Death could not be far off from most of them, but\r\nthey never spoke of it, never seemed to think of it; and, although life\r\nwas dull, they clung to it as by monotonous habit that _is_ but knows\r\nnot why.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill another of our well-remembered _pensions_ was on the bright\r\nVesuvian Bay. The flaming mountain overlooked us, Naples floated beyond\r\nus like a dream-city, before us the Mediterranean shimmered and shone\r\nlike a sultana's satin tunic. We could drop a stone from our windows\r\ninto the sea; we ran dripping from our sea-baths up long stairs, across\r\ntiled balconies, into our vast rooms; all day and all night the swish\r\nand lisp of the soft tides mingled with our voices and dreams.\r\n\r\nAs somebody said of us that summer, we were a \"cosmopolitan mess,\" a\r\nhotch-potch of nationalities, such as is always found in so general a\r\nrendezvous as Italy. We were rather less of a hotch-potch, however, than\r\nin London, but somehow it seemed to us that our peculiarities were more\r\nsalient than they could ever appear in proper and conventional\r\nBloomsbury. We were largely German, as the travelling population of\r\nItaly is. In Bloomsbury our medium of expression was the English\r\nlanguage, and English was the language at table, no matter how foreign\r\nour company. But in this Italian _pensione_, where the faces were\r\ncontinually changing, the languages changed as often. One day only\r\nEnglish was the rule, and those who could not unite with the majority\r\nremained mute. Another day, with a tremendous incursion of Teutons, who\r\nalways seem to travel in hordes, only German gutturals held the table,\r\nand we who had no facility with them muttered meek French or sullen\r\nEnglish to our neighbors. The next day French would be the rule, and\r\nTeuton must mumble in it and Anglo-Saxon stammer or hold its peace.\r\nCuriously enough, although we were in Italy, Italian was rarely, almost\r\nnever, spoken among us, our only use of it being in orders to the\r\nservants. Our landlady was English, with an Italian husband, but they\r\nboth held only upper menial places in the establishment, and never\r\ndreamed of sitting at table with us or of meeting us upon any terms of\r\nequality. This want of familiarity with Italian proves how little mere\r\ntravellers and haunters of _pensioni_ ever know of the middle-class\r\ninhabitants of the country. The Italians themselves stir from home very\r\nseldom; they almost never admit foreigners into their own houses, and\r\nwhen forced abroad seek cheap Italian inns rather than the innumerable\r\nboarding-houses infested by the outer barbarian. Italian peasant life is\r\nopen to all foreigners, but not that of the middle classes.\r\n\r\nOur landlord had a daughter whose cheek was pale and whose garments hung\r\nloosely upon her. When first we remarked this and her heavy eye,\r\neverybody laughed.\r\n\r\n\"The usual story,--loves and rides away,\" was remarked in various\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nIt was heartless to laugh, but we could not help it. For wan and\r\ndrooping landlords' daughters had become so familiar to us in Italian\r\n_pensioni_ that we needed only to glance at the set of each one's gown\r\nand the tint of her cheek to know if HE were still present and wooing or\r\nhad faithlessly ridden away. The race, however, was not always to the\r\nrider.\r\n\r\nOne evening under our window, when the air swooned with languid scent of\r\nlemon- and orange-blossoms, we heard a sobbing and a sighing that\r\nreminded us of the Mock Turtle in \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Glancing out,\r\nby the soft light of the summer moon, enhanced by the shimmering water,\r\nwe saw two persons who seemed to be weeping in each other's arms under a\r\nshuddering ilex. The stouter one--he was not the taller--we recognized\r\nas a young Teuton for whose sake we had seen a gown very loose and a\r\ncheek very wan afar off among the Alban Hills only a month before.\r\n\r\n\"I love you, Tita, I love you. I have thought I loved a dozen times\r\nbefore, but I was mistaken. I never loved any girl before,\" he boohooed.\r\n\r\n\"_Dio mio!_\" laughed the girl. \"All the _Tedeschi_ say that who come\r\nhere. I wonder they are not tired of the old tune. I--I am _fiance_ to a\r\n_bel Espagnol_ who rode away a month ago, and who ought to have been\r\nback before now.\"\r\n\r\nWe found our Teuton fellow-_pensionnaires_ to have tastes more unnatural\r\nthan for landlords' daughters. One of them we had remarked for his\r\nextreme beauty, not entirely of feature and rich olive hue, but of\r\npathetic, dreamy expression,--as we said, like an ideal St. John. At\r\nfirst we never spoke of him except as \"St. John.\" We gradually ceased to\r\ncall him so, however, when we had seen him several times at table, and\r\nwe grew finally so coarsely irreverent as to call him \"_Mange-tout_.\"\r\n\r\nOur meat was brought from distant Naples, making the journey without\r\nice, under a broiling Italian sun. Often it came to table so shorn of\r\nits pristine freshness that not the hungriest of us could condone its\r\nodor. One sultry night everybody's plate went away untouched, save two\r\nor three. Flesh and fowl were \"high,\"--yea, \"twice high,\" as the British\r\ngourmet prefers his game. St. John's plate was _not_ sent away. That\r\nideal being was served three times, after which he rose and helped\r\nhimself from the side-table, remarking half apologetically as he did so,\r\n\"The cook has really surpassed himself to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ja! ja!\" echoed our Teutons.\r\n\r\nWe saw our St. John next morning sucking raw eggs before his coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Because the _nourriture_ is poor. I do it to strengthen me,\" he\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\"When I am well I eat all I can hold,\" he confidentially imparted to the\r\n_table-d'hote_. \"When I am ill I eat more than I do when I am well.\"\r\n\r\nOne of our _pensionnaires_ was a swarthy Brazilian, living upon a\r\ncolossal and mysteriously-begotten fortune and spending what remained to\r\nhim of life upon the Mediterranean shores. He knew every _pensione_ of\r\nthe whole wide region, and in strident, barbaric tones--continually\r\nreminding us of the savage aboriginal blood betrayed by narrow eyes and\r\nhigh cheek-bones--flooded our _table-d'hote_ with the gossip of\r\n_pensioni_ at Capri, Castellamare, Pompeii, Sorrento, and Salerno,--the\r\ngiddiness of all the widows, the cunning of the young girls, the\r\nwickedness of the wives, and the barefaced or clever intriguing of\r\nhusband-hunting mammas. All that year, as we quietly slipped from one\r\nMediterranean _pensione_ to another, we met and recognized the heroes\r\nand heroines of our Brazilian's _chroniques scandaleuses_, and we\r\nbreathed many a thanksgiving that we were slipping east while he slipped\r\nwest and thus were not known of name and evil fame in advance of our\r\ncoming.\r\n\r\nOur Brazilian was a devout Catholic, which led to his giving great\r\noffence at our table. Nobody could endure to pass him anything or to\r\ntake anything from him, and the hideous bird-of-prey-like rattling of\r\nhis right hand at any service turned many a delicate appetite away and\r\nmade our Brazilian of almost Gorgon-like effect upon all new-comers. The\r\nfinger-nails of his right hand were vowed to the Virgin: for two years\r\nthey had been uncut, and now, like fiendish claws, extended two inches\r\nbeyond the withered and dusky fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Why am I not liked by _ces belles dames_?\" he asked one day. \"They\r\nnever ask me to their excursions; they seem to shrink from taking my\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of your talons,\" somebody ventured to explain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no! the Blessed Virgin would never allow _that_,\" he asserted\r\nconfidently.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the summer, however, he seemed to lose confidence in\r\nthe Virgin's tampering with natural law for his sake. One day we saw\r\nthat the talons were sacrificed, and were told that the Mother of God\r\nhad announced to our Brazilian in a dream that she would accept a vow\r\nnever to cut his hair in place of the devoted nails.\r\n\r\nA few days later our _divoto_ came upon the loggia, where sat a bevy of\r\nladies of many nations, in a screeching aboriginal rage.\r\n\r\n\"I sacrificed my vow to you _belles dames_, although I refused it to\r\nMadame la Duchesse de B----,\" he screamed, \"and yet you avoid me. Am I\r\nnot an _homme fait_\" (certainly our sixty-year-old Brazilian had never\r\nread \"Pendennis\"), \"and better than any of these boys you admire? Do you\r\nimagine the Blessed Virgin will not pay you off for this? Do you think\r\nshe will go back on a man like me,--of whom Victor Emanuel himself was\r\njealous when I rode on the Pincian with Madame la Princesse della\r\nGr----?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe thus found many peculiar people in the varied experiences of _nos\r\npensions_. We found often learning and often culture, but more vulgarity\r\nthan we did refinement, more splendor than delicacy of habit, more\r\nblatant ignorance than culture, more _sans gene_ than dignity of manners\r\nand character. It is always thus in any mere \"cosmopolitan mess,\" any\r\n\"hotch-potch of nationalities.\" For the eccentric and obnoxious types\r\nare always and everywhere those most largely _en evidence_, while the\r\ngentle and refined nestles closest to the cool, still, mossy ground,\r\nleaving sunny flaunting to wider blooms and stronger perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RANDOM SHOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn existence, if even a dull one, in a large and busy city full of life,\r\nwhen contrasted in the mind of a romantic young lady of eighteen summers\r\nwith an enforced captivity in an isolated cottage by the sea-shore,\r\ngrows to possess charms and an excitement which, until so considered,\r\nmay have remained totally unappreciated.\r\n\r\nCould anything be more depressing than the knowledge that this latter\r\ncondition must be endured with no other companion than a hypochondriacal\r\npapa, whose ailings so monopolized his time and attention that a\r\ndaughter's happiness sunk into insignificance? Little wonder that she\r\nshould melt into tears at so undesirable a prospect, that she should\r\npity herself and her luckless fate, and that, when fully realizing the\r\ndepths of loneliness into which she was to be precipitated for five\r\nlong, weary months, she should jump at the dismal conclusion that her\r\ndoll was stuffed with the most inferior variety of saw-dust and wish\r\nwith lachrymose sincerity that she were dead and buried and out of this\r\nworld of sorrow. Papa might then wish that he had been more considerate.\r\nPerhaps; but at that particular moment he was contemplatively\r\nassimilating his fish, and that process admitted of no consideration\r\nwhatever beyond that of the fish itself. So when his daughter raised her\r\ntearful eyes to his saffron countenance across the board she found no\r\nsigns in it of the sympathy she felt so much need of. What could she\r\nexpect, anyway? Dr. Nevercure had been consulted, and this time felt\r\nthat something desperate must be done. His patient had persistently\r\nrefused to pronounce himself in any degree benefited by the long course\r\nof physic which he had prescribed, and in fact had become an elephant\r\nupon his professional hands; and thus, as a last resort, he had\r\nrecommended an entire change of air and perfect quiet, with a periodical\r\nharmless dose for the sake of appearances. Nevercure must be obeyed; the\r\npatient himself, since it seemed to be his delight to fancy himself an\r\ninvalid, must naturally be supposed to find a pleasure in the remedies\r\nfor his sufferings, and therefore evinced no regret whatever at the\r\nleaden prospects, but, on the contrary, made a most exasperating\r\nexhibition of saintly resignation, very galling to the young lady, who\r\nconsidered herself the only one really injured.\r\n\r\n\"And when must we go?\" she asked, continuing a series of questions which\r\nher sudden burst of tears had interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Friday morning,\" replied Mr. Moreley curtly.\r\n\r\n\"Friday morning! And this is Tuesday night! Why, papa, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mabel, I said Friday morning. My arrangements are made, and I will not\r\nhear another word about it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he didn't. Mabel left the table as soon as decorum would permit, and\r\nbetook herself up-stairs to her own sanctum to nurse her grief in\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\nShe sat long by the open window, pondering over her hapless lot, her\r\nchin upon her hand, her dark eyes far away in thought,--sad thought,\r\njudging from their expression,--the wind playing in her light, wavy\r\nhair, her full red lips parted slightly, showing the interest which her\r\ntheme awakened, and the fresh bloom upon her cheeks now going, now\r\ncoming, following in some subtile way the quick movements of her mind.\r\nAn hour slid by, and then she started from her revery with a sudden\r\nthought. The sadness in her eyes gave way to mirth and a twinkle of fun;\r\nthe color came faster, the lips broke into a most roguish smile.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it!\" she whispered. \"I _will_!\" she added, with convincing\r\nemphasis and a countenance brimming over with mischief.\r\n\r\nIt was a foolish project,--a most insane and inexcusable one. It had,\r\nhowever, the spice of romance, and it might afford her some amusement\r\nand a little excitement during the coming months of misery. It was\r\nsuggested by some demon of mischief, and was all the more attractive\r\ncoming from such a source. It came about naturally enough, too. On the\r\nmorning of that same day her particular intimate, Anna Desbrough, and\r\nshe had fallen upon the college catalogue which Anna's brother Tom had\r\nsent for to guide him in his preparatory studies. The names of the\r\nstudents had proved interesting reading-matter, and the two girls had\r\nspeculated as to the probable appearance of this one and that, and had\r\neven gone so far as to select the one whom they thought they would\r\nprefer among those mentioned. They had indulged in a vast deal of\r\nimaginative nonsense, and had finally thrown the book aside and returned\r\nto more rational topics; but the recollection of the morning's pastime\r\nhad not quite faded from Mabel's mind. The name was still fresh in her\r\nmemory,--Mortimer Granville Dudley: how grand! how musical!\r\n\r\n\"I will!\" she had exclaimed, with determination; and, being a young lady\r\nof her word, she hastily collected pen, ink, and paper to carry out her\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MR. DUDLEY,\" she wrote (she had hesitated long between\r\n     \"Mr. Dudley\" and plain \"Mort,\" with the result shown), \"how long\r\n     ago it seems since those days when we were playmates together! I\r\n     hardly think it probable, though, that you can have forgotten me.\r\n     My position would certainly be a very awkward one if you had. But,\r\n     remembering as I do so well those happy times, and particularly\r\n     your juvenile vows of constancy at the moment of our parting, I\r\n     cannot believe that I am mistaken in trusting in their sincerity\r\n     and truth.\r\n\r\n     \"By a mere accident I heard the other day of your whereabouts, and,\r\n     as I for one still feel the same interest in my playmate that I\r\n     used to, I resolved, I think I may say courageously, to discover\r\n     whether he still gave promise of fulfilling all the hopes I then\r\n     entertained for him.\r\n\r\n     \"I wonder if some of our early experiences are still as fresh in\r\n     your mind as they are in mine! Do you remember that day you made me\r\n     stand guard while you 'blew' old Jones's eggs in retaliation for\r\n     his having turned informer against you? I think it was the time he\r\n     told about your having promoted a fight between two dogs. And do\r\n     you remember the day on the skating-pond when you broke through the\r\n     ice and frightened me into fits by disappearing three times below\r\n     the surface, while all the time you were standing, as you afterward\r\n     confessed, on solid bottom? I thought then I should never forgive\r\n     you for causing me in that unguarded moment to betray my feelings.\r\n     And then the telegraph scheme by which we communicated that time I\r\n     had the measles. It all seems to have occurred in some other world,\r\n     looking back at it now; and yet what happy times those were! I\r\n     believe I could go on forever with these reminiscences; but perhaps\r\n     they are not as sweet to you as they are to me; perhaps I am only\r\n     boring you with them. It would be a great disappointment to me,\r\n     though, to know that you never looked back with a sigh to those\r\n     days and never gave a thought to your once so devoted playmate.\r\n\r\n     \"I am going to a place called Stillton this summer. I dare say you\r\n     never heard of it: it is in Maine; and I must confess I anticipate\r\n     a very stupid time there. Perhaps I shall have nothing else to do\r\n     but reflect upon the days of my early youth. Am I _quite_\r\n     forgotten?\r\n\r\n      \"Your playmate of old,\r\n\r\n         \"JANE JENNINGS.\r\n\r\n    \"BOSTON, June 10, 188-.\"\r\n\r\nThe _nom de plume_ was borrowed from Mabel's faithful servant,--nurse in\r\nearlier days, a description of maid now,--and was a safe one, as old\r\nJane proper was never known to receive letters, and, moreover, could not\r\nhave deciphered her own name on the envelope had one arrived for her.\r\n\r\nThe conflict on the following morning as to whether it should be sent or\r\ndestroyed, the tremble of the little hand that finally dropped it\r\nirrevocably into the iron post-box, the vain reproaches and unanswered\r\nlongings for its return, the subsequent prayers that it might by some\r\nprovidential interference be intercepted or miscarry, all followed in\r\ndue course, as well as later a revulsion of feeling and an anxious\r\nwatching for the mails, hope deferred, and sickness of heart.\r\n\r\nFriday came. The journey, miserable as was its object, was accomplished,\r\nand Stillton, in all its tomb-like silence and drowsy do-nothingness,\r\nwith its few glaring white houses and its one dusty road, offering no\r\napology or explanation whatever for its purposeless existence, at last\r\nwas reached, and Farmer Galusha Krinklebottom, in accordance with Dr.\r\nNevercure's arrangements, met the jaded travellers at the station in his\r\nrickety shay, prepared to take them over to the cottage.\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't more'n three mile,\" he said consolingly. \"The roads ain't none\r\ntoo good this season, an' Kittie--that's _her_\" (pointing to his\r\nmare)--\"don't feel over-skittish; she's nigh onter fourteen year, an'\r\nright smart, too, fur her age, but sorter broken-winded latterly; but I\r\nguess we'll make it afore dark.--Go 'long, Kittie!\"\r\n\r\nThe ancient mare started off. Her fore-legs were stiff and jointless,\r\nher hip-bones painfully prominent, her ribs sadly bare, and her nose\r\nhung dejectedly toward the ground; but she still possessed some\r\nmechanical power of locomotion, and the \"shay\" began to squeak and\r\nrattle in her wake. Galusha was proud of his native hamlet. \"That\r\nthere's our meetin'-house,\" he said, but its whitewash and green blinds\r\ndid not seem to excite the travellers' admiration. \"An' that longish\r\nhouse yonder's Pincus's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pincus's?\" asked Mabel, with a yawn.\r\n\r\n\"Pincus Sass's, mum. 'Tis the hotel, mum. That's him in the door.\r\nHulloa, Pincus!\" he shouted, shooting a line of tobacco-juice over the\r\ndash-board.\r\n\r\n\"Haow, Galusha!\" came in nasal accents from the door-way. \"Who ye got in\r\nthe phayton?\"\r\n\r\n\"The folks as has took the cottage yonder!\" called back Galusha.\r\n\r\n\"Humph! I'll be dummed!\" was Pincus's audible comment as the shay\r\nrattled on.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder's the store,\" presently added Galusha, pointing with his two\r\nfeet of whip-stock to a place placarded with patent-medicine\r\nadvertisements, and apparently the rendezvous for all the\r\ntobacco-chewers of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n\"And the post-office?\" asked Mabel timidly.\r\n\r\n\"In the store, mum. Barton Bump's our pos'master. Some'at of a man,\r\nBarton is. He was 'p'inted by the Pres'dent 'imself. Barton fit in the\r\nwar, yer see, an' I 'spect Gen'ral Grant took a powerful shine to him.\r\nHe made him pos'master fust thing.\"\r\n\r\nThe greatness of Barton Bump did not seem to impress the party as much\r\nas Galusha anticipated. \"Git 'long, Kittie!\" he said, retiring into\r\nhimself and seeking solace in a fresh mouthful of tobacco. He couldn't\r\ncontain himself long, though. He soon exclaimed, \"So you's the folks as\r\nhas took the cottage yonder. Well, I want t' know!\" He paused again to\r\nchew awhile, and then continued, \"Yer ain't bin much hereabouts, I\r\nreckon?\" Another reflective cud. \"Well, 'tain't so durned 'citin' here,\r\nmaybe, as 't might be up to Bosting, but we 'casion'lly gets up reels\r\nan' sich for the young folks an' 'joys erselves.--Go 'long, Kittie!--You\r\nheard tell, I reckon, on Farmer Manton, lives down 'longside this here\r\ncottage of yourn. No? Well, I want t' know. He's 'sider'ble of a man in\r\nthese parts, Manton is. His gals is great on's on flare-ups, an'\r\npowerful smart gals they be, too.--Go 'long, Kittie Krinklebottom!--But\r\ndurn me if he ain't got the cussedest boy as ever stepped! He don't do\r\nnothin' but mope about an' ac' silly. He didn't never do no chores about\r\nthe yard nor nothin', an' one fine day he come to Manton an' says,\r\n'Dad,' says he, 'I want to go to college,' says he. Well, the old man\r\nwas that cumflusticated an' took aback that says he, 'John,' says he,\r\n'yer ain't no durned use on the farm,' says he, 'an', if yer got the\r\nnotion, go, an' God bless yer!' An' John went,--that's nigh onter four\r\nyear ago,--an' he ain't got ter be perfessor nor nothin' yet. I guess as\r\nhe's cracked; an' one day says I, kinder kind-like, 'Farmer Manton,'\r\nsays I, 'John's not right,' says I. 'Galusha,' says he, kinder hot, 'you\r\nmind yer own business,' says he. 'I ain't father to no idjots.' An' I\r\nain't said no more sence.\"\r\n\r\nGalusha laughed long and heartily over this reminiscence, while Kittie\r\njogged on along the road to the sea. Presently they turned a sharp bend\r\nin the road; a pretty little Queen-Anne cottage came in sight, backing\r\nupon a thick wood and overlooking the ocean, and Galusha, reining in the\r\nmare, just as though she would not have come to a halt unassisted,\r\nexclaimed, \"Here yer be!\"\r\n\r\nIt required, of course, three or four days for Mabel to become\r\naccustomed to her new surroundings. There was the prettily-furnished\r\nhouse to make acquaintance with, while she wondered all the time what\r\never induced its owner to plant it so utterly out of the world; there\r\nwas the little forest of pines to explore, and its most romantic nooks\r\nto be discovered; and there was the sea, a thing of never-failing\r\nbeauty, to gaze upon from the rocky cliffs, as it dashed itself in fine\r\nspray against their base, or from the broad crescent beach beyond, as it\r\nrolled its crested billows up the sandy slope. Yes, all these things\r\nwere very pleasant,--far more delightful than she had anticipated. She\r\nthought during those first few days that she would like to live on there\r\nforever, until the novelty wore off and her father's ailings crushed out\r\nthe new life which the change had given birth to and kept him locked in\r\nhis own den with his miseries; and even then nature began to pall as a\r\nconstant and sole companion, and her mind turned with ever-increasing\r\nanxiety to the one event which could possibly break this spell of\r\nmonotony. Had her letter _in fact_ miscarried? or could it be that the\r\nfavored recipient had treated it with cold contempt, ruthlessly\r\ndestroyed it or cast it into the wastepaper-basket? Many were the\r\npainful, blush-provoking thoughts that each terrible possibility\r\nsuggested. She had long since decided that she had been a little fool,\r\nand that of course Seniors in college had better things to do than to\r\nanswer silly girls' more silly letters, when one day on her regular\r\nvisit to Barton Bump's store she overheard the following:\r\n\r\n\"It's bin a-kickin' round this here store three days, an' I ain't goin'\r\nter be bothered no longer. Hiram, jes' you stick the dratted thing in\r\none o' them 'ficial en-_vell_ups, an' 'dress it to Wash'ton, D.C.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ain't ye goin' to advertise it, dad?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tain't no good advertisin' it, Hiram. There ain't nobody as calls\r\nherself Jennings in the hull county, an' I know it.\"\r\n\r\nBut Mabel interrupted him. \"Miss Jane Jennings, is it? Why, that letter\r\nis for me!\" she exclaimed eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Fur you, miss?\" asked Barton, glancing at her suspiciously over his\r\nspectacles. \"Ain't your name Moreley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, in some embarrassment, \"but--but Jane Jennings is\r\nour servant, you know. Give me the letter. I will take it to her.\"\r\n\r\nBarton hesitated. He hadn't had any communication with the government\r\nfor some time, and liked to remind them in the capital now and then of\r\nhis existence. \"Well,\" he said finally, and with reluctance, \"ef you're\r\nsartin', why, here ye be.\" And Mabel took it, and bore it away with a\r\npalpitating heart, quite forgetting to purchase the supplies which the\r\ncook had commissioned her to bring home for dinner.\r\n\r\nIn the most secluded spot in the dark pine wood she broke the seal and\r\nread as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"MY LONG-LOST JENNIE,--Remember my charming little playmate?\r\n     Remember the one object that makes my childhood a bright picture\r\n     to look back upon? Of course I do, with all the pleasure in the\r\n     recollection that her presence used to inspire in those happy days.\r\n     Remember the diabolical exploit with Jones's eggs? Distinctly. And\r\n     the telegraph system? I believe I could go through the alphabet\r\n     now. And I remember, too, that day on the skating-pond, with\r\n     contrition, however, and a prayer that my heartlessness may be\r\n     forgiven. How can I ever have been unkind to my faithful Jennie?\r\n     Nor have I forgotten--how could I?--our tender parting. You said\r\n     that you could never forget me, and now your letter proves that you\r\n     were sincere; and I hope my answer may convince you that when I\r\n     told you of my never-failing constancy I spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a delightful surprise to me to have heard from you at last.\r\n     The years that I have been thinking and dreaming of you and wishing\r\n     for news of you are over, and now I have at last found the idol of\r\n     my boyish admiration.\r\n\r\n     \"But you must have changed as well as I in all this time. I should\r\n     like very much to have a likeness of you as you are now, to compare\r\n     with that which is indelibly stamped on my memory. Won't you send\r\n     me one?\r\n\r\n     \"It surprises me that in recalling those experiences of ours you\r\n     should have omitted the one that is most vivid and most delightful\r\n     to me. Can it be that you have forgotten the little house we built\r\n     under the old chestnut-tree, where you prepared the supper on your\r\n     best doll's china for the weary hunter who used to return laden\r\n     with green apples, currants, strawberries, and other wild beasts,\r\n     the spoils of his chase? How generous and self-sacrificing you used\r\n     to be with the slender provisions, and anxious lest the foot-sore\r\n     huntsman should not get enough to sustain his toilsome existence!\r\n     What an example you were of domesticity! and I cannot believe that\r\n     you are anything else to-day but the same good pattern for\r\n     womanhood.\r\n\r\n     \"Do let me hear from you soon again. Although I have existed so\r\n     long in ignorance even as to whether you were still alive, the\r\n     knowledge now that you are so, and that you have still a corner in\r\n     your memory, if not in your heart, for me, has revived all my old\r\n     feelings and keeps me in constant hope of further news of you.\r\n\r\n    \"As ever, your affectionate playmate,\r\n\r\n    \"MORT.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the hopes and fears of the past few days, there was\r\nthe reply, after all, and Mabel, after reading it through three times,\r\nconcluded that \"Mort\" must be \"splendid,\" and that this sort of sport\r\nwas far ahead of anything she had yet attempted. It combined, so she\r\nargued, all the spice of a heavy flirtation with the advantage of a\r\nstrict incognito, and, with judicious management, she thought that it\r\nmight be carried on in perfect safety for some time to come.\r\n\r\nMr. Moreley was worse than usual that evening; dinner, without the\r\narticles which Mabel should have brought from the village, was not a\r\nsuccess, and such a catastrophe always aggravated his disease. Having\r\nlearned who was to blame for it, it was many days before he could\r\nforgive or forget his daughter's inhuman treatment of her much-suffering\r\npapa, so that she was left even more than usual to her own devices, and\r\nspent a deal of her time either with novels or her writing-case in the\r\nromantic corners of the pine wood or on the rocks and along the beach by\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nDudley's letter had been answered one afternoon, when the late sun was\r\nthrowing long shadows and touching the distant sails upon the ocean with\r\na shade of delicate pink, when a gentle breeze was only rippling the\r\nsurface of the water and the waves were only murmuring soft music upon\r\nthe sand; and if but half of the tender emotion which these surroundings\r\ngave birth to were transferred to her paper, Dudley, if his heart were\r\nat all as he had represented it, must have found in her reply an ample\r\nreward for his strange constancy. Circumstances, at any rate, went to\r\nshow that it had been very welcome and pleasing to its recipient, for it\r\nwas scarcely three days later that a second missive for Miss Jane\r\nJennings reached the Stillton office and was duly claimed by Mabel\r\nbefore any possible accident could throw it into other hands. She had\r\nperused it with marked pleasure; it had contained many fresh allusions\r\nto \"childhood's happy hour,\" many additional and very original accounts\r\nof doings in their fancied youth, several frank compliments, and a\r\nreiterated and very urgent request for a photograph. She had allowed\r\nseveral days to pass in considering what notice to take of this somewhat\r\nimpudent demand. At one time she almost concluded to let Mr. Dudley drop\r\naltogether. What right had he to call upon her for her likeness? At\r\nanother she was quite as firmly resolved to send him one. The whispered\r\nvanity which told her that he would not be disappointed in it was not\r\neasily resisted. At last, however, a simple middle course--an easy way\r\nout of the difficulty--suggested itself, and, as it promised, too, to\r\nthrow another puzzling veil of mystery over her identity, she seized it\r\neagerly, and that very afternoon put it into execution. Seated on the\r\nrocks that overlooked the sea, gathering thoughts in long gazes toward\r\nthe distant horizon, and allowing imagination to roam as freely as could\r\nher eyes over the unbounded ocean, she wrote her answer. After touching\r\nupon the episodes of their earlier days which his last letter had\r\nbrought to light, and adding the details of a few more experiences which\r\nher fertile mind suggested, she turned to the subject of the photograph.\r\n\"I wish it were better,\" she wrote. \"It is a shockingly poor likeness, I\r\nknow, but may serve as a reminder of your little playmate, if not as a\r\nperfect representation of her.\" She sealed the envelope, enclosing the\r\npicture, and, seeing Galusha Krinklebottom drive by just at the moment,\r\nhailed him, and sent photograph, letter, and all in his care to the\r\nmails.\r\n\r\nIt is strange how, even after bitter experience, many of us persist in\r\nputting the cart before the horse,--doing the deed before taking the\r\nproper consideration of its consequences. When the letter had gone, and\r\nnot before, Mabel fully realized that she had done something positively\r\nwicked and unpardonable. Her terrible sin kept her awake all that night\r\nand preyed upon her mind for days afterward. \"I hardly know the girl,\"\r\nshe pleaded in self-excuse to her injured conscience. \"What of that?\"\r\nexclaimed the voice sternly. \"I don't like her, anyhow,\" she added,\r\nalmost in tears. \"What of that?\" persisted the voice angrily. Oh, well,\r\nit was done and could not be undone now. It was mean, perhaps, to send\r\nhim another girl's picture, but, considering that the whole world\r\nacknowledged that Mabel Moreley was far the better-looking of the two,\r\ndid not this sacrifice of vanity palliate the offence? It seemed, after\r\nall, a very remote possibility that any harm could come to the other\r\ngirl through this freak of hers. She could not, of course, have sent her\r\nown picture, and this was the only one in her collection that had seemed\r\nat all passable: so, eventually, the iniquity of the proceeding faded\r\nbefore these convincing arguments, and she soon found herself much more\r\ninterested in looking forward to the receipt of the likeness which he\r\ncould not fail to send in return than with reproaches over a hasty piece\r\nof folly.\r\n\r\nThe reply arrived in due course, and with it the photograph of a\r\nhandsome face, with fine, bold eyes, a prominent nose, an expressive\r\nmouth, and a moustache in the springtime of its existence. It was\r\ncaptivating, but, after her own deception, she was naturally in doubt as\r\nto who the true owner of that very attractive physiognomy might be. If\r\nindeed it were Dudley, her random shot had hit the mark. To her\r\nimagination he had always been handsome; whether he were so in reality\r\nhad never before seemed at all a matter of importance; but now, with a\r\npicture before her from which a lasting impression might be derived, it\r\nbecame necessary either to accept it or reject it. Should this face,\r\nthen, be hereafter regarded as that of her playmate in his maturer\r\nyears? After careful scrutiny she decided that it should, and from that\r\ntime, when it was not in her hands undergoing admiration, it lay in\r\nsecure repose among the treasured notes, faded flowers, and\r\nsweet-smelling rose-leaves in her writing-case. Not many days later she\r\nfelt impelled to acknowledge its receipt, and, taking her materials in\r\nthis precious box to a shaded corner of the pine wood, spread them out\r\nbefore her and was soon deep in her pleasant task. She was necessarily\r\nobliged to draw heavily upon imagination in tracing the points in the\r\nphotograph which she asserted recalled vividly his youthful countenance,\r\nand, when at last she had finished, lay back exhausted by the effort,\r\nand soon fell into a condition of dreaminess bordering closely on sleep.\r\nSuddenly, however, the sound of approaching footsteps aroused her, and\r\nbefore she had time to gather together all her sacred belongings, the\r\nfigure of a tall man, in a slouch hat and with an unprepossessingly\r\ncadaverous cast of features, appeared from behind the rocks, which until\r\nthen had hidden them from each other's view. He stopped short on\r\ndiscovering her, raised his hat in some confusion, muttered something in\r\napology for his intrusion, and was just planning a hasty retreat, when\r\nshe asked, with some nervousness, \"Do you wish to see my father?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, with equal embarrassment. \"I--I was going down to the\r\nbeach. I forgot for the moment that--that this place was occupied: this\r\nis a short cut for me. I hope you will excuse my trespassing. I live\r\njust back of here,\" he went on, in an explanatory way, as she made no\r\nreply. \"My name is Manton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" Mabel exclaimed, remembering Galusha Krinklebottom's story of the\r\nyoung man who was \"not right,\" and concluding that this must be he. \"I\r\nam sure there can be no objection to your taking this way to the beach,\r\nMr. Manton,\" she answered, smiling sweetly, in the hope of averting a\r\npossible outbreak of lunacy.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her with a grave, formal bow, and started to pass on, when\r\nhis eye fell upon the recently-arrived photograph as it lay on a rock by\r\nher side. He stopped, and looked quickly from it to her face and then\r\nback at the picture.\r\n\r\nMabel's face grew scarlet. Could it be that he recognized it? Was her\r\nsecret discovered? Or was this merely a madman's strange idiosyncrasy?\r\n\r\n\"We have a mutual friend, I think,\" he said, rather bluntly, though in a\r\ngentle tone.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed?\" asked Mabel nervously.\r\n\r\n\"That must be Mort Dudley,\" he went on, half to himself, and still\r\ngazing at the photograph.\r\n\r\n(\"Then it _must_ be his own likeness!\" inwardly exclaimed Mabel.)\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon if I am mistaken,\" Manton added apologetically; \"the\r\npicture caught my eye and reminded me very strongly of a college\r\nclassmate of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you know Mr. Dudley?\" she asked, deeply interested, and forgetful\r\nnow of the stranger's reputed mental unsoundness.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" he replied, looking at the photograph more closely. \"This\r\nis his class-picture. I have one like it. It is an excellent likeness of\r\nhim; don't you think so?\"\r\n\r\nMabel said that she thought it was, and blushed again as she said it.\r\n\r\nManton concluded from this that there must be something thicker than\r\nmere friendship between Dudley and his new acquaintance, and an awkward\r\nsilence ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Manton presently, \"Dudley was the warmest friend I had\r\nat college. I hadn't many,\" he added, in a tone that struck Mabel as\r\nbeing somewhat sad. \"I hadn't time to make many friends, or even\r\nacquaintances. The work was rather harder for me than for most of the\r\nmen, I think; but Dudley, from the very first, helped me when he could,\r\nand I think was the only cheering influence I met with during the entire\r\ncourse. He was always so full of life and so jolly, and at the same time\r\nsympathetic, and never depressed and in the blues, as I frequently was.\r\nI never could understand why he was so good a friend to me, unless\r\nperhaps because there may be a force of attraction between two\r\nextremes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I should not fancy you at all like him,\" Mabel said, trying to\r\nimpress him with her intimate knowledge of Dudley's nature.\r\n\r\n\"No, not at all. In the first place, he has been so differently brought\r\nup: he has travelled, seen a great deal of the world, and profited by\r\nthis experience, and I don't believe has ever had to take a thought of\r\ndollars and cents: thus he is naturally liberal both in his ideas and\r\nwith his money. I am not,--not because I don't wish to be, but because I\r\ncannot be. Secondly, he is another animal physically,--an athlete born;\r\nwhile I have never engaged in any sport, know nothing of such matters,\r\nnor could I learn them. And then there is such a vast difference\r\nmentally between us: his mind is as quick and nimble as his muscles,\r\nwhile mine is much like a muddy stream, I'm afraid,--opaque and\r\nsluggish. Yes, I have often wondered over his friendship for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are detracting from your own virtues in order to flatter\r\nhis,\" said Mabel, smiling, but rejoicing inwardly over the happy\r\nselection she had made in the college catalogue.\r\n\r\nManton protested that he had said no more than the truth, and continued\r\nto sound the praises of his friend until the hour for Mabel's luncheon\r\narrived, when he departed for his solitary stroll upon the beach,\r\ndelighted, though by no means as much so as Mabel was, at having found a\r\nfriend of Dudley's.\r\n\r\nAfter this it happened, if not by actual design, at any rate with\r\nsuspicious frequency, that Manton took the short cut to the beach and\r\nthat Mabel read her books and wrote her letters in the pine wood. One\r\nday when they met thus, and after their acquaintance had grown to be\r\nsome three weeks old, Manton found the young lady (whom he had never\r\nregarded in any other light than that of Dudley's betrothed) very\r\nabstracted and apparently little inclined to lend the customary willing\r\near to his tales of their mutual friend. This troubled him sorely. That\r\nthere had been some lovers' quarrel he could not doubt, and it pained\r\nhim to think that any cloud should have arisen to darken the brightness\r\nof his friend's existence.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard from Mort to-day?\" he asked suddenly, in his blunt\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Mabel acknowledged that she had, but\r\nfurther than that she vouchsafed him no information, and he soon\r\nconcluded to continue his journey to the beach, his presence seeming\r\nonly to add to Miss Moreley's nervousness and evident irritation.\r\n\r\nWhat was she to do? How could she save herself now? Why indeed had she\r\ndone this foolish thing? She took the letter from her pocket to read it\r\nonce more, hoping that some suggestion might spring from it, some\r\npossible means for her escape be brought to light.\r\n\r\n\"Miraculous as it may appear to you,\" he wrote, dating his letter from\r\nNewport, \"I have met the image of my early playmate! It was at a\r\ngarden-party, yesterday. At first it seemed impossible that two such\r\nfaces could exist. I was on the point of rushing to her, clasping her in\r\nmy arms, and hailing her with all the warmth that would only be natural\r\nupon discovering my long-lost Jennie, but some prudent voice suggested\r\nasking for an introduction first. I did so. To my astonishment, the name\r\nwas not Jennings at all, but Bathersea, and her acknowledgement of my\r\nimpressive bow and more expressive smile was as chilly as a winter\r\nmorning. I took occasion to introduce my name into the conversation,\r\nfearing that she might have misunderstood it. No light of intelligence\r\nbeamed from her lovely eyes. I referred to my college days (and I\r\nsuspect she took me for a Freshman), I hinted at Stillton, I even\r\nsuggested that we had met as babies; but she only said that her\r\nrecollection did not extend to that early period, and left me--for what?\r\nit is humiliating, but I will acknowledge it--for another fellow. This\r\nat last convinced me that she could not be my Jennie. Her resemblance to\r\nthe photograph, however, was perfect,--really startling. In justice I\r\nmust add that she was lovely. It is the face that has captivated me, not\r\nthe girl; she rather snubbed me,--but that face! I never saw half so\r\nmuch beauty in one face before.\"\r\n\r\nIt was bad enough that he should have actually met the girl whose\r\npicture she had been cowardly enough to send in place of her own, but\r\nwhat followed literally chilled the blood in her veins. He was coming!\r\nComing to Stillton! Coming to find her! Was actually on the way at that\r\nmoment to claim her acquaintance,--perhaps to show her letters and\r\nreveal all her deceit to that inexorable papa of hers should she\r\ndisclaim all knowledge of him, or to make matters even more difficult to\r\nexplain should she confess the truth of their relations. \"Heavens!\" she\r\nexclaimed, in fright. \"What shall I do? what shall I do?\" Her time for\r\naction was fast growing short. The afternoon was rapidly advancing. Ah,\r\nmight not Manton be her saviour? But how explain to Manton her deceit\r\ntoward him during all this time of their acquaintance? No, she could not\r\ntell him: he would not understand. Could she not boldly confront him,\r\nimplore him to forgive and forget her thoughtless foolishness, beg him\r\nto spare her, to leave her before this terrible secret should reach her\r\nfather's ears and bring everlasting woe and disgrace upon her? This\r\nseemed to call for even more courage than was required to face the awful\r\nalternative. Should she, then, confess all to the father whose ire she\r\nso greatly feared?--go to him now with tears of repentance and cast\r\nherself at his feet, praying for mercy and for protection? There was the\r\ncliff, with its terrifying height and its sharp, ugly crags: she would\r\nalmost rather throw herself into the swashing, roaring waves at its base\r\nthan tell the tale of her folly. Yet--oh, what _was_ she to do? Quick!\r\nTime was flying on its swiftest wings. He might be there at any moment.\r\nOh, would no one save her?\r\n\r\nWhile she was still hoping and praying and despairing, no conclusion\r\nreached, no aiding hand outstretched for her deliverance, the day\r\nadvanced toward its end; the sun sank lower and still lower upon the\r\nridge of those long, darkly-wooded hills to the westward, shed its last\r\nred rays upon the ocean, reflected its dying brilliancy upon the fleecy\r\nclouds above, and soon left nothing but a fading twilight to show men\r\ntheir way about the world. To a man seeking unknown objects in a\r\nhitherto unexplored vicinity this condition of affairs is unpropitious;\r\nbut Dudley, having tied his hired steed to a neighboring fence,\r\nconcluded nevertheless not to be daunted, and proceeded on foot in\r\nsearch of the \"new-fangled, sorter yaller-and-red, p'inted-roofed\r\nhouse,\" where the village postmaster had told him the lady whom he\r\nsought resided. It was not difficult to find: it was the only thing for\r\nmiles around that laid any claims to \"new-fangledness,\" and he\r\nrecognized it at a glance. From behind the hedge that bordered the place\r\nhe scrutinized each window. No smiling face appeared to welcome him. He\r\nscanned the lawn, the shrubbery, the dark shade beneath the trees: no\r\ngirlish figure could be seen to answer to the one he carried in his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps my letter hasn't reached her,\" was his disappointed soliloquy.\r\nThen followed a few moments of silent thought. Suddenly he pulled\r\nhimself together, put on a bold front, stalked manfully up to the porch,\r\nand rang the bell determinedly. When a man in brass buttons appeared to\r\nanswer his summons, Dudley felt decidedly more reassured, and his\r\nprevious fears of being greeted with a countryman's heavy boot were\r\nagreeably dispelled.\r\n\r\n\"Is Miss Jennings in?\" he asked, feeling for his card-case.\r\n\r\nJames stared. \"Beg pardon, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jennings,--Miss Jane Jennings,\" he repeated, with emphasis.\r\n\r\nJames surveyed the visitor from his jaunty straw hat to his neat\r\npatent-leathers, cast a queer look at the crocodile card-case, replied,\r\n\"Humph! I'll see,\" and shut the door in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Infernal impudence, by Jove!\" exclaimed Dudley, in wrath. \"Does the\r\ndolt take me for a tramp?\" There was nothing for it, however, but to\r\nwait where he was, which he did with bad grace enough until he heard a\r\nhand upon the inner knob and saw the door slowly open, to disclose the\r\ngenerous proportions of Mabel's maid.\r\n\r\n\"The old woman, by the gods!\" he whispered, in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"I called--\" he began.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Jane, in a flutter of excitement.\r\n\r\n\"I called--er--I have the pleasure of addressing Mrs. Jennings, I\r\npresume?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Miss_ Jennings,--Jane Jennings,\" she corrected, and blushing at the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nDudley stared open-mouthed. \"_Miss_ Jennings! Jane Jennings!\" he\r\nrepeated, in astonishment. Then a terrible possibility dawned upon him.\r\nA cold perspiration broke out all over him. Oh, god of love, was this\r\nhis precious Jennie? Had he made an irrevocable ass of himself over this\r\nlump of ancient human flesh? A hue of brilliant scarlet suffused his\r\ncountenance. Oh, what an imbecile, a simple, drivelling idiot, he had\r\nbeen!\r\n\r\n\"Was it me that you wished to see, sir?\" she asked, wondering at his\r\nstrange manner.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he answered fiercely. \"I think there must be some mistake,\" he\r\nadded more calmly, struggling to repress his feelings. \"Very sorry to\r\nhave--er--Good-day.\" He turned suddenly, and, without another glance at\r\nhis long-lost Jennie, quickly gained the road and the welcome cover of\r\nthe hedge.\r\n\r\nHis uppermost feeling was undoubtedly that of anger mixed with\r\nmortification, and he swore with sublime eloquence at his own folly as\r\nsoon as he was out of ear-shot of the house; but the ludicrous side of\r\nhis situation could not but strike him before he had gone many steps,\r\nand he laughed grimly in spite of himself while repeating the\r\nundeniable assertion that he had been a lamentable fool.\r\n\r\nAs he swung himself into his saddle prepared to shake the dust of\r\nStillton that very night from his feet, a voice came to him through the\r\nsemi-obscurity:\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, there! Hold on, I say!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave his nag a good kick in the flank and urged him to the top of his\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there! Dudley! Hold on!\"\r\n\r\nHe was recognized--caught! That cursed photograph of his! \"Go on, you\r\nbrute, go on!\" he cried to his sorry beast. There was not much speed in\r\nhim, however, and a minute later footsteps were quickly overtaking him.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Dudley! Don't you know me?\" panted his pursuer.\r\n\r\nHe turned for an instant in his saddle. Why! Could he believe his eyes?\r\nSurely it was Manton! He reined in.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Manton, old boy, what--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dudley, what on earth brings you here?\" gasped Manton.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I've been trying to find out, Manton. Take my oath I\r\ndon't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Manton, fixing his eyes curiously upon his friend.\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" reiterated Dudley.\r\n\r\n\"No girl in the case?\" suggested Manton significantly.\r\n\r\n\"Girl!\" He laughed uneasily. Could Manton be in the joke? \"No,\" he\r\nanswered, \"I can safely say that there is not,\" the figure of the old\r\nnurse clearly in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, Dudley,\" said Manton; \"perhaps I know more about your\r\naffairs than you think I do. She was frightfully cut up this morning,\r\nand I think your letter did it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut up, was she? Ha! ha! Cut up! She appeared to be in one pretty\r\nsubstantial piece just now, notwithstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Dudley; get off that horse and come over to the farm for\r\nsupper. There's something wrong. I want to have a talk with you. Now,\r\nthere has been some misunderstanding, hasn't there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I confess I was rather taken in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taken in! Nonsense! Do you imagine she would take you in?\"\r\n\r\n\"It struck me that she might, boots and all,\" replied Dudley, with a sad\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\n\"Do talk sense, Dudley. It's a pity that this should have occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"A d--d shame, I call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would swear that she loves you, Dud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I suppose I ought to feel flattered; but, somehow, Manton, I\r\ncan't get up much enthusiasm over _her_. She's not exactly my style.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're very fastidious, then. Here, come this way through the wood:\r\nit's a short cut. I confess my experience has been very much more\r\nlimited than yours, but _I_ never saw a girl more--\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\" asked Dudley, with a sneer.\r\n\r\n\"A young lady, then,--more charming, more lovely in every respect, than\r\nMiss Moreley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss who? Moreley? (I believe he has got one of those wandering fits,\r\npoor fellow!) Well, Manton, old boy, I won't dispute that for a moment,\r\nbecause--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you say that she is not 'your style.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I must get him home immediately,\" sighed Dudley inwardly,\r\ncommiserating his friend.\r\n\r\n\"She talks of you incessantly, Dud, and only seems happy when I am\r\nanswering her thousand and one questions about you.\"\r\n\r\n(A young lady hidden among the rocks and pines blushes crimson as this\r\nspeech is wafted to her on the still evening air, and stamps her little\r\nfoot in vexatious indignation.)\r\n\r\n\"Her manner to-day,\" continued Manton, \"showed plainly that your letter\r\nthis morning hurt her exceedingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Moreley! Letter this morning! _My_ letter! Come, now. By Jove!\r\nStop a moment. I believe-- Tell me, did you ever chance to see her\r\nhandwriting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes: I've mailed several of her letters to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so! Is that her writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nDudley muttered something incoherent about \"little wretch!\" \"Jane\r\nJennings!\" and, pointing excitedly to the scene of his recent\r\ndiscomfiture, asked, \"Lives there, doesn't she?\"\r\n\r\nManton, too astonished at his friend's remarkable conduct to speak,\r\nnodded assent, and Dudley hastened away toward the house, shouting back,\r\n\"I'll see you later, old fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't! don't! don't!\" came a shrill voice from among the rocks.\r\n\r\nBoth turned. \"Why, here she is now!\" cried Manton.\r\n\r\nThere was an awkward pause. The blush upon her face detracted nothing\r\nfrom her beauty. Dudley felt drawn toward her as a needle is drawn by\r\nthe North Star. He walked quickly toward her, hesitated as she drew\r\nback, stopped as she cast her eyes upon the ground, and presently said,\r\n\"Life would be a very sad thing, would it not, if we had no pleasant\r\nmemories of the past? I believe the thoughts of those happy days of our\r\nchildhood are the sweetest I have ever had. It brings them back to me\r\nvery vividly to find you now after so many years. Won't you even shake\r\nhands with your old playmate?\"\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand shyly and reluctantly, and he took it in both of\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\"I'll walk on, Dud, and put this horse of yours in the barn,\" said\r\nManton. \"I'll come back presently.\" And he left them, feeling that\r\nperhaps the reconciliation which he was looking forward to between them\r\nwould be more complete if they were left alone.\r\n\r\n\"Are you angry with me for coming?\" asked Dudley softly, when he had\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"You should not have done it,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Were we never to meet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am glad I took matters into my own hands,\" said he, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"But you must go to-night--now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject gave rise to considerable argument, at the end of which,\r\nhowever, Dudley remained as determined as before, and, as a matter of\r\nfact, he did stay, accepting Farmer Manton's hospitable invitation to\r\nmake his house his home. He would stay a week, he said; he had no\r\nimmediate pressing engagements, and his delight at being with his old\r\nfriend Manton once more was too great to admit of his leaving\r\nimmediately upon finding him.\r\n\r\nThe week proved to be a delightful one. Farmer Manton's buxom daughters\r\ngot up one of their celebrated \"flare-ups\" in his honor, and all the\r\nfemale population of Stillton was set by its ears. Mabel was not\r\npresent, of course,--fortunately, too, perhaps, for her state of heart\r\nand mind was strangely and unnaturably irritable at that time, and his\r\npromiscuous attentions to the various country belles might have provoked\r\na feeling of which she would afterward have been very much ashamed.\r\n\r\nThe week was over, yet he lingered. The sea-breezes, he declared, were\r\njust the sort of tonic he needed, and the quiet country-life the very\r\nthing he had been longing for for years.\r\n\r\nOne day, after an introduction by Farmer Manton to Mr. Moreley, he\r\nenlarged so eloquently upon the benefits of such an atmosphere, and\r\nspoke so feelingly about the ailments to which the latter considered\r\nhimself a martyr, that the old gentleman's heart actually warmed toward\r\nhim, and he violated all the laws of his monotonous existence and one of\r\nDr. Nevercure's most specific instructions by inviting him to dinner.\r\n\r\n\"How did you do it?\" asked Mabel, with an incredulous smile, when he\r\ntold her down on the beach that afternoon of his unexpected success with\r\nthe much-feared parent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's my fatal fascination, I suppose,\" he answered exasperatingly.\r\n\r\nThe weeks that followed were passed much as all of us have passed some\r\nhappy weeks of our own lives, and the rest of their story is but the old\r\none once more repeated.\r\n\r\nDudley persistently maintains to this day that there is much more in a\r\nname than is generally conceded, but his young wife ridicules such\r\nnonsense, saying that it was nothing but a random shot that chanced to\r\nhit the mark. A significant fact is that the boy has been named plain\r\nJohn, after their never-to-be-forgotten friend John Manton.\r\n\r\n  C. W. WILMERDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEABODY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn respect to her facility and opportunities for advancing the cause of\r\nscientific knowledge, Harvard University certainly stands pre-eminent.\r\nShe has a splendid astronomical observatory, and laboratories for\r\nchemistry and physics unexcelled elsewhere. Her botanical garden is the\r\nonly one for instruction of any consequence in the Union, and its\r\ndirector, Asa Gray, is the chief of American botanists. In the Museum of\r\nComparative Zoology, founded by Louis Agassiz and sustained by his son,\r\nAlexander Agassiz, Cambridge possesses the most productive, and in some\r\nrespects the completest, museum of animal life in the United States,\r\nwhile it offers to the laboratory student of natural history advantages\r\nwhich he can find equalled nowhere else in the whole world. Last, and\r\nmost modern, it has a museum of anthropology which in point of material\r\nis rivalled only by the National Museum at Washington, and in point of\r\ninstructiveness is probably in advance of anything yet attained in the\r\nUnited States, despite its youth and small resources. This school and\r\nstorehouse is the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology,\r\nwhose merits deserve a wider recognition than they have yet received.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1866, George Peabody, of philanthropic fame, was distributing\r\nhis bequests among the educational institutions of the Eastern States,\r\nhe was desirous of giving to Harvard a certain sum of money, but was\r\npuzzled as to its proper application. It was suggested to him to endow a\r\ndepartment of archaeological research, and his proposition to that effect\r\nwas considered by several friends of the university. The institution had\r\npeculiar needs at that time. Its finances generally were weak. The\r\nlibrary and the zoological museum especially needed money, and the idea\r\nof a special department of prehistoric science was entirely new. It was\r\ndecided, however, not to attempt to influence Mr. Peabody away from his\r\nown plan. President Walker saw that European minds were eagerly turning\r\ntoward studies of primitive man, that the interest in the subject would\r\ngrow from year to year, and that, as the first museum in the country\r\ndevoted to this branch, it would have the best chance for securing\r\ncollections rapidly going to destruction or distributed through private\r\ncabinets. More than all, the fittest man to take charge of it was at\r\nhand, in the person of Professor Jeffries Wyman. On the 3d of November,\r\n1866, therefore, the arrangements were completed, and Mr. Peabody\r\ndelivered to a board of trustees one hundred and fifty thousand dollars\r\nas an endowment. On the first of the following month Dr. Wyman began his\r\ncuratorship.\r\n\r\nAs yet, of course, there was no museum. As a nucleus, Professor Wyman\r\ncontributed some Indian implements and crania, the nooks and corners of\r\nthe college were ransacked for stray skulls, stone axes and arrow-heads,\r\npottery that had been ploughed up in the suburbs, and relics of\r\ncolonial days, all of which, when brought together, served to fill a few\r\nempty cases in a room of Boylston Hall. Soon afterward, printed\r\ncirculars were issued, and gifts began to flow in from the neighborhood,\r\nillustrating the life of the native races at and just before the time of\r\nthe Pilgrims' landing. Several societies in Boston made permanent\r\ndeposits of ethnological accumulations in the infant establishment; Mr.\r\nE. G. Squier, the Peruvian explorer, sent a Peruvian mummy of great\r\nvalue, with seventy-five crania, and promised larger gifts; the\r\nSmithsonian Institution gave a lot of duplicates, many of which were\r\ngathered by the great Wilkes Exploring Expedition; the Honorable Caleb\r\nCushing forwarded antiquities gathered by his command during the Mexican\r\nwar; and several famous collections were bought in Europe, illustrating\r\nthe stone and bronze ages. Thus public interest was stimulated, and even\r\nat the end of the first year a very presentable sketch of a picture of\r\nthe aboriginal people of the world was to be seen in that small room in\r\nBoylston Hall. It was accessible to any interested visitors, and began\r\nto receive attention from the scientific world, particularly after the\r\nfirst annual report appeared in January, 1868, containing an original\r\nessay by the curator and a full statement of the growing importance of\r\nthe museum.\r\n\r\nFrom this beginning the work went steadily on. Contributions from\r\nprivate and public sources came without stint. The fund of the museum\r\navailable for explorations and the purchase of collections was\r\njudiciously expended year by year, and each annual report contained news\r\nof great interest to _savants_. The amount of material gathered speedily\r\noutgrew its original quarters, and a new story was added to Boylston\r\nHall for the reception of the museum. At the end of seven years the\r\ncatalogue showed over eight thousand entries, one entry in many cases\r\ncovering a series of objects. Then a great calamity happened: Jeffries\r\nWyman died.\r\n\r\nWyman had been the soul of the whole enterprise. At the founding of the\r\nmuseum he gave up those studies in anatomy and natural history which had\r\nmade him famous and furnished him so sure a foundation as an\r\nanthropologist, in order to devote himself entirely to the new\r\nenterprise. His death occurred in September, 1874, closely following\r\nthat of his great associate in Cambridge, Louis Agassiz.\r\n\r\nDr. Wyman had found an eager companion in his studies and excursions,\r\nduring several years preceding his death, in Frederick W. Putnam, who\r\nwas almost the only man in the neighborhood of Boston having either\r\ninterest or capability (not to speak of opportunity) for such pursuits.\r\nA Salem lad, he was one of that group of students whom the elder Agassiz\r\ngathered round him when he began teaching at Harvard,--a group\r\ncomprising Alpheus Hyatt, A. E. Verrill, J. A. Allen, Edward S. Morse,\r\nN. S. Shaler, A. S. Packard, Jr., and others now of worldwide\r\nreputation. Putnam was an all-round zoologist, but his specialty was\r\nfishes. Accident, nearly thirty years ago, turned his attention to the\r\nshell-heaps and the primitive implements of his home-neighborhood. The\r\nonly man to whom he could go for guidance in studying these was Dr.\r\nJeffries Wyman, at that time his instructor in comparative anatomy. Thus\r\nthe two men were drawn more and more together, and when Wyman organized\r\nthe new museum Putnam found much time for helping him, although at that\r\ntime he was in charge of the Salem Museum, an editor of \"The American\r\nNaturalist,\" a publisher, and the permanent secretary of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, a position which he still\r\nretains. It happened, consequently, that upon Dr. Wyman's decease Mr.\r\nPutnam was the only man suitable and available to become his successor,\r\nand he was quickly appointed to fill the vacancy.\r\n\r\nSixty thousand dollars of the original fund had been set aside by\r\nPeabody as a building-fund, but he decreed that this sum should be\r\nallowed to grow until it amounted to at least a hundred thousand\r\ndollars. This limit was attained in ten years, and in 1876 a building\r\nwas begun for the accommodation of the museum. The college gave the\r\nground,--a lot on Divinity Avenue, nearly opposite the old Divinity\r\nSchool, and close to the great structure occupied by the Museum of\r\nComparative Zoology. Surrounded by green lawns and avenues of old trees,\r\nit is the pleasantest spot in all that charming city. The building was\r\ncompleted and entered in 1878. It is of brick, four stories in height,\r\nthoroughly fire-proof, simple in design, and tasteful in ornamentation.\r\nThe present structure is only a fifth of what the whole building is\r\ndesigned ultimately to be. Two rooms yet remain to be opened to the\r\npublic, but their fitting will not long be delayed. Its spacious doors\r\nopen on Divinity Avenue, and there let us enter and glance at its\r\ntreasures.\r\n\r\nThe entrance-hall is a square well in the centre of the building,\r\naccommodating the broad stairways and galleries, and affording room for\r\nmany large objects, such as carved figures of stone and the models of\r\nthe ruined houses and present pueblos of the village Indians of the\r\nSouthwest. The walls are of finished brick.\r\n\r\nOn the left a large room is devoted to the office, to the reception of\r\nnew specimens, and to the library, which is intended to include only\r\nworks pertaining to this special study. On the right opens the room\r\nwhere naturally and properly begins our survey of the museum. Like the\r\nother apartments, it occupies the whole of one side of the building, and\r\nis about thirty-five by forty feet in dimensions. Its ceiling is\r\ntwenty-two feet in height, but a broad gallery runs around all four\r\nsides, which adds almost as much exhibition-space as would a second\r\nstory, without spoiling the open and well-lighted effect of a lofty\r\nroom. Glass cases cover the walls above and below; upon the floor stand\r\ncombined upright and table cases, resting upon long cabinets of\r\ninterchangeable drawers, and the gallery-rail supports a line of\r\nnarrow, flat cases. In each room is a fireplace, while all are well\r\nheated in winter and comfortably ventilated in summer, so that they are\r\nattractive to visitors.\r\n\r\nThis first room holds what is regarded by the curator as the most\r\nimportant series of objects ever brought together illustrative of that\r\nancient people who built the mounds and the singular stone graves of the\r\nsouthern and central portions of the United States. The contents of each\r\nmound and grave are arranged by themselves, so that as one passes from\r\ncase to case a picture of the human life of the past is presented as\r\nnearly perfect as can be constructed out of that part of the handiwork\r\nof the people which has escaped decay. Here can be seen and studied the\r\nmany singular results of the potter's art, simple and complex in form\r\nand varied in style of ornament; carvings in stone, shell, and bone;\r\nimplements and ornaments of stone, shell, bone, mica, clay, copper, and\r\nother substances; fragments of cloth and twine twisted from vegetable\r\nfibres, which have been preserved through charring. One case in this\r\nroom is devoted to a collection of objects from caves in Kentucky and\r\nTennessee, and contains many interesting fabrics, including a large\r\npiece of cloth woven from bark-fibre, shoes formed by braiding leaves of\r\nthe cat-tail rush, and many other things kept for us in the dry air of\r\nthe caves through uncounted centuries. In the gallery are grouped\r\nseveral collections from Mexico and Central America, which are\r\nespecially rich in pottery.\r\n\r\nIn the room, on the second floor, over this one are stored the most\r\nancient--most primitive--evidences of man's presence yet discovered in\r\nthe Atlantic States,--evidences in the shape not only of chipped stones\r\nof his fashioning, but relics of his very frame, which incontestably\r\nextend the period of human occupation along our Atlantic coast back at\r\nleast to the glacial era. I refer to the palaeolithic remains exhumed by\r\nDr. C. C. Abbott from the terraces of river-drift in the valley of the\r\nDelaware at Trenton, New Jersey. These deposits of pebbles and sand owe\r\ntheir origin to the continental glacier, whose front reached in solid\r\nmass almost to that locality; through them was worn the bed of the\r\npresent river, and whatever is contained in their undisturbed mass can\r\nbelong to no more recent date than the later days of the glacial period.\r\n\r\nIn these gravels near his home, when cut through by railway-building and\r\nthe wearing of the river-bank, Dr. Abbott found his palaeoliths under\r\nsuch circumstances as left no doubt that they were quite as old as the\r\nformation of the bed itself. If you are inexperienced, and take in your\r\nhand one of these specimens by itself, it may seem to you simply a\r\nsmall, broken boulder or a fragment from some ledge; but the trained eye\r\nsees (what observation and experiment confirm) that fractures like those\r\non these specimens are not such as are made by accident; and when a\r\nhundred specimens are displayed before you, all doubt as to their origin\r\nvanishes at a glance.\r\n\r\nSome of these relics are deeply eroded by the weather, others much less\r\nso; some are pebbles that have required only a slight chipping to adapt\r\nthem to their owner's need, others sharp-edged, elaborately flaked,\r\n\"turtle-backed\" weapons, similar in shape to much of the more modern and\r\nfinished work in flint. With few exceptions, however, these are made of\r\nargillite, and in many cases they have lost the fineness of edge and\r\nangle by weathering and by attrition against the gravel in which they\r\nwere rolled under glacial floods. They bear about the same relation in\r\ntheir roughness and shapelessness to the carefully-worked relics of the\r\nred Indian found on the surface, or in the accumulation of soil\r\nresulting from the decay of countless generations of forest and herbage\r\nwhich everywhere covers the old gravels, as the matchlock of the Pilgrim\r\nFathers bears to our target-rifle. But they are of human origin, and\r\nassert the presence of humanity on the Atlantic coast of America at the\r\nclose of the glacial period just as logically as the teeth in the\r\ngreen-sand argue sharks in the Cretaceous sea.\r\n\r\nIn these gravels are entombed scattered bones of the mastodon and other\r\nextinct mammals, but it was long before there appeared any relic of a\r\nhuman frame concerning which there could be no misapprehension. At last,\r\nquite recently, Dr. Abbott exhumed a tooth, worn and washed and sunken\r\ndeep in the undisturbed drift,--a tooth of a contemporary of the\r\nmastodon and of one of the makers of the argillite implements that\r\npresupposed him; a man who never got beyond the palaeolithic stage,--the\r\nearliest rudiments of a culture far beneath any savagery of historic\r\ntimes in the Atlantic States. This silent witness of man's antiquity in\r\nAmerica is among the treasures of this museum which are unique and\r\npriceless.\r\n\r\nWho were these earliest men? and what has the museum to show similar to\r\nthis from other parts of the world? are questions that naturally present\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe only attempt at an answer to the first, with which I am acquainted,\r\nis suggested by Dr. Abbott in chapter xxxii. of his \"Primitive\r\nIndustry.\" After showing that during the last glacial epoch there were\r\nno climatic conditions southward of the actual ice-cap which would\r\npreclude the existence of men, since they would gradually become used to\r\nthe slow change (as did so many surviving forms of animal and vegetable\r\nlife), Dr. Abbott further clears the way by demonstrating that a strong\r\nline of demarcation exists between the remains of these people and the\r\nearliest traces of the \"red Indian\" race which Europeans found in\r\npossession of the body of the continent; this gap is not one of\r\nstratification, or, perhaps, of time, but is shown by a strong\r\ndistinctness in the character of the worked stones forming the weapons\r\nand implements of each people in respect to both material and degree of\r\nperfection. Considering further the probability (from known evidence)\r\nthat the Innuit (Eskimos) once occupied all the interior of the\r\ncontinent, together with the ascertained fact that on the Atlantic\r\ncoast this people quite recently extended as far south as Cape Cod, and\r\ncomparing the drift-implements with the exceeding rudeness of the stone\r\nimplements possessed by the Eskimos when first seen by the whites, Dr.\r\nAbbott concludes that in the palaeolithic men we have the ancestors of\r\nthe Innuit, who were driven to Arctic fastnesses by a new and more\r\npowerful race of invaders, who retained possession of the great mass of\r\nthe continent, and whose descendants remain among us yet.\r\n\r\nNow, to examine what the Old World has to show, if anything, similar to\r\nthese rudiments of civilization, we must go to the opposite gallery,\r\nwhere we shall find, in the collections from the river-drift of England\r\nand Southern France, implements equally rude and old-looking, but made\r\nof flint instead of the inferior argillite with which the American\r\nautochthones contented themselves. Next, a little better on the whole\r\nthan these, we shall see the relics of stone and bone--the latter not\r\nonly whittled and broken, but often ornamentally carved--which came from\r\ncaves in England and Southern Europe: some have been dug from beneath\r\nthick layers of stalagmite.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, then, palaeolithic man is separately considered as the\r\nRiver-drift man and the Cave man, the former believed to be much the\r\nolder people, and known by the series of simplest patterns of stone\r\nimplements found in the late Pleistocene river-beds. This River-drift\r\nman wandered over the greater part of Europe and Asia, leading a\r\nnomadic, feral life,--a hunter of very low order, like the modern\r\nAustralian. The Cave man, on the contrary, seems to have been restricted\r\nin his range, which of itself is considered indicative of different age\r\nand race, and he was far in advance of the River-drift man in the\r\nvariety and workmanship of his weapons and implements. Between both, or\r\nrather between the era of the latter and that of the men who made\r\nimplements of polished stone and chipped flint, there is just such a\r\nbroad distinction as obtains in the United States between the traces of\r\npalaeolithic and those of neolithic man.\r\n\r\nThe exact parallelism of the palaeolithic ages in the Eastern and Western\r\nhemispheres is still more or less disputed by anthropologists, but the\r\ngeneral opinion seems to be this: If not two peoples, the River-drift\r\nmen and the Cave men were certainly distinct sections of the same race\r\nwhich found their way into Europe at widely-separated times, the former\r\nhaving far the higher antiquity. It is believed by Dr. Boyd Dawkins\r\n(from whose celebrated cave-explorations in Great Britain has been\r\nderived a representative series of specimens for the museum) \"that the\r\nRiver-drift man is as completely extinct at the present time as the\r\nwoolly rhinoceros or the cave bear\" which he fed upon; but all authors\r\nidentify the men of the caves with the Eskimos, who there, as well as\r\nhere, were forced to retreat by the pressure of a race of new-comers,\r\nsuperior in prowess and cultivation, whose traces we call _neolithic_.\r\n\r\nIn America, however (where the Atlantic coast, at least, does not afford\r\ncaverns like those of Western Europe), the evidence all goes to show\r\nthat palaeolithic men were in continuous possession of the region from\r\nthe time when they first appeared until driven northward by the Indians,\r\nperhaps close upon the retreat of the great glacier. Returning to the\r\nAbbott collection, we shall find that it contains a large quantity of\r\nrude arrow-points, scrapers, and other forms of stone implements, some\r\nof which are much better than any of the \"turtle-backs\" or other\r\npalaeoliths from the lower gravels. These are found in the upper part of\r\nthe drift, resting upon them and buried in the humus _above_: in the\r\nlatter position they are, of course, more or less intermixed with the\r\njasper and quartz relics of the modern Indian; but these are always made\r\nof argillite, are ruder, are much weather-worn, and never occur in the\r\n\"open-air workshops\" of the Indians, where quantities of flint-flakes\r\nand unfinished implements of jasper and quartz and of superior pattern\r\nare found lying together within a limited space. These argillite points\r\nand scrapers seem to belong to the palaeolithic man toward the end of his\r\n\"age,\" manifesting a higher stage of culture reached by gradual\r\nimprovement. It thus appears that while in Europe the rude-stone age was\r\ndivided into two eras,--the River-drift and the Cave,--in Eastern\r\nAmerica the aboriginal Eskimos held sway without interruption, and\r\nslowly bettered themselves through unnumbered centuries, until at last\r\nthey were driven into icy exile by merciless conquerors, where, no\r\ndoubt, they lost much of the advancement they had gained under more\r\ngracious conditions.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that we were obliged to go to another part of the\r\nbuilding in order to see what remains came from palaeolithic Europe and\r\nmake our comparisons. This is in accordance with the plan of the museum,\r\nwhich arranges its treasures according to locality, and not according to\r\nshape, utility, relative age, degree of finish, or any other style of\r\nclassification. All the objects found in a particular spot--taken from\r\none grave or a single shell-heap, or, in wider range, belonging to the\r\nsame geographical region--are kept together, no matter how dissimilar\r\nthe associated articles may be. Arrangement on any other plan must\r\nnecessarily become to a greater or less extent the exponent of the views\r\nof the one man or clique that controls the matter,--must involve a\r\ntheory, and hence prove an obstacle to the student who seeks an\r\nunbiassed interpretation of the truth. If it does nothing more, it\r\ndestroys the proper perspective. For example, one of the cases in this\r\nmuseum contains the contents of graves opened in an Indian cemetery on\r\nSanta Catalina Island, California, comprising native work, mortars and\r\npots of stone,--for no native pottery occurs in the Californian\r\ngraves,--beads, flint arrow-heads, etc., together with Spanish swords,\r\nstirrups, glass, and other articles of European manufacture. Separate\r\nthese associated articles,--put the arrow-heads and stone pots with a\r\nvast number of other arrow-heads and stone pots,--and there would have\r\nbeen nothing to show, except at the expense of long study, that their\r\ndate of use was no older than the Spanish invasion of California, or, in\r\nthe case of the iron-ware, that it had belonged to Indians who yet clung\r\nto many of their native customs and manufactures. Shown together as they\r\nwere collected, one perceives at a glance, and the brain appreciates in\r\ntrue perspective, the picture of life on Santa Catalina Island when\r\nthose graves were dug, perhaps three centuries ago. The importance and\r\nvalue of this plan become more and more apparent as the student\r\nadvances. In the publications of the museum, and elsewhere, the curator\r\ndraws such conclusions as seem to him just from the materials he\r\npossesses; but he regards it as due to the public that the specimens\r\nthemselves shall be exhibited as found, for the verification of his\r\nexplanations and the investigation of those who come afterward. The\r\nfirst and foremost object of this museum--as it should be of every such\r\ninstitution--is the preservation of historical evidence; the second, the\r\nmaking it accessible in its original aspect for study. Ornamental\r\ndisplay, when in the least degree inconsistent with scientific uses, has\r\nno place in any of the rooms. Nothing is put up because it is pretty;\r\nand if the history of any specimen is at all doubtful, it is kept out of\r\nsight, or else its label contains the proper cautions and queries.\r\n\r\nHaving scanned the relics of that far-away time which seems to have\r\npreceded the coming even of the red men into the United States, let us\r\nnow see what the museum has to show of the arts and industries and\r\namusements of those \"Indians\" who were found in possession when\r\nEuropeans came to the New World.\r\n\r\nThe whole continent was inhabited by what was substantially the same\r\nrace of men, divided into many language-stocks, subdivided into a still\r\ngreater number of more or less cohesive tribes, and segregated into\r\ninnumerable bands or villages. As they varied in dialect, organization,\r\nand environment, so were they greatly diversified in mental\r\naccomplishments and in outward customs and belongings. In subordinate\r\npoints the characteristics of some divisions contrasted most pointedly\r\nwith those of others; yet in certain cardinal aspects the whole\r\npopulation known in historic times from Tierra del Fuego to Eskimo-land\r\nwas a unit. All were red-skinned Americans, \"tarred with the same\r\nstick.\"[1] Moreover, it has been supposed that no race other than these\r\nred men has ever permanently occupied any portion of the United States\r\nbetween the departure of the palaeolithic Eskimos and the advent of\r\nEuropeans,--the \"Mound-Builders\" not excepted.\r\n\r\nTo the prehistoric relics and the modern manufactures of these natives\r\nof America the Peabody Museum is chiefly devoted. The material preserved\r\nwas obtained by its original collectors in a variety of ways. Much of it\r\nwas gathered in farm-fields, where it had been turned up under the\r\nplough one piece at a time. All parts of the United States are\r\nrepresented, but some regions more plentifully than others, not only\r\nbecause one district may contain more persons interested in the matter,\r\nbut because of the comparative scarcity of relics in some parts. One of\r\nthe most densely populated districts in the whole Union in Indian life\r\nwas the Atlantic slope of the Alleghanies; and the valleys of the\r\nfishing-rivers draining this slope have yielded an enormous quantity of\r\nexamples of primitive wares, in the shape of architecture, pottery,\r\nweapons, tools, and ornaments of stone, shell, horn, and metal.\r\n\r\nNo one point, probably, has yielded more than the farm and immediate\r\nneighborhood of Dr. C. C. Abbott (heretofore referred to), at Trenton,\r\nNew Jersey. This farm occupies a bluff and wide meadows facing the\r\nDelaware River. It was a location unexcelled in advantages for the\r\nmild-mannered, sunshine-loving Leni-Lenape. On the dry high ground they\r\ncould build their lodges underneath great trees and find themselves upon\r\nthe highway of travel, while the rich bottom-lands gave them\r\nnever-exhausted planting-ground for their fields of maize. Better than\r\nall, they could overlook not only these fields, but far away down the\r\nriver, and scan the approach of strangers, or watch the approach of the\r\nreturning parties of hunters and fishermen, whose canoes came up the\r\ncreeks to moorings at the very foot of the bluff. That this spot was\r\nlong tenanted by an Indian village there seems ample proof. Almost every\r\nspecies of Indian handiwork, in stone, bone, and clay, known to the\r\nAtlantic coast has been found in and about this farm during the past ten\r\nyears, and the total yield of a square mile in that locality has been\r\nnearly twenty-five thousand specimens. The great majority of these are\r\nnow in the Peabody Museum, and they have furnished Dr. Abbott with the\r\nmaterial for our most valuable book on the stone age in North America,\r\nentitled \"Primitive Industry\" (George A. Bates, Salem, 1881). They\r\nconsist of varied series of axes, celts, hammers, bolas, knives, drills,\r\nscrapers, mortars and pestles, food-vessels and agricultural tools,\r\nfishing- and hunting-implements, spear- and arrow-points, club-heads,\r\ndaggers, and other weapons, pipes and gaming-stones, ceremonial and\r\nornamental objects,--all of stone,--besides a deal of pottery (chiefly\r\nin fragments), bone-work, and implements of copper, probably procured\r\nfrom other tribes.\r\n\r\nThen there is another source of supply,--the shell-heaps. It was the\r\ncustom of all the aborigines who lived anywhere near the sea to go to\r\nthe shore in summer--the whole band or a group of families together--and\r\ncamp there for weeks or months. Certain spots were resorted to annually,\r\njust as we go year after year to our favorite sea-side hotel. The time\r\nthere was spent chiefly in catching and eating salt-water food, and,\r\nmost of all, oysters and clams. Our \"clam-bake\" is a survival of their\r\nfeasts on the beach. Of course under such circumstances extended heaps\r\nof castaway shells and fish-bones would accumulate, and become of\r\ndimensions which seem extraordinary only when we forget the lapse of\r\ntime since they were begun. Many objects, some castaway, some lost,\r\nwould become intermixed with the loose surface shells and be rapidly\r\nburied beyond further disturbance. Thus an exploration of these heaps of\r\nrefuse might be expected to disclose, and really does show, a great\r\nvariety of indestructible indications of the people around whose\r\nsummer-lodges they were formed,--how they lived, what they fed upon, and\r\nthe degree of skill and culture to which they had attained. Scores of\r\nthese shell-heaps from Maine to Texas have been excavated by private\r\npersons or by the agency of the museum, and the yield of each, however\r\nmiscellaneous, is accessible to us. We may make out from the bones a\r\nlist of the animals upon which the makers fed, we may tell from the\r\nstone implements how the men hunted and fished, from the awls, needles,\r\nskin-dressers, etc., of bone and horn with what skill the women worked,\r\nand largely what materials they used, while the bits of baked clay mark\r\ntheir position in the ceramic scale,--a well-accepted standard of\r\nprogress. Nor are these things mixed and confused when deposited in the\r\nmuseum. All from each shell-heap are kept together, and specimens may\r\nthus be compared with one another all along the coast-line; or the\r\nvisitor may go to another room, where the great Rose collection from\r\nDenmark is displayed, and compare them with the relics from the\r\nshell-heaps (_Kjoekken-moedings_) and village-sites of Jutland, where\r\na parallel life was lived and the monuments of savage homesteads line\r\nthe Baltic beaches.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the sites of villages, towns, and cities have contributed\r\nlargely to this collection of native antiquities. This is especially\r\ntrue of the Southwest, of Central America, and the Andean region, where\r\nthe Aztec, the Maya, the Quichuas, the Aymaras, and other\r\nhighly-organized nations held sway over wide regions. The greatest\r\nremains of these people lie in their architecture, the ruins of which\r\nastonish the traveller in Mexico, Yucatan, and Peru. Beyond fragments of\r\ncarving, this, of course, is unavailable to a museum; but beside the\r\nimages and fragments of representative ornament engraved in stone that\r\nhave been brought from these ruins hang pictures of the entire building\r\nor city, so that the visitor's memory is refreshed, and he is enabled to\r\nplace the relics in their proper relation to the whole.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the remarkable remains of the ancient \"cliff-dwellers,\" who\r\ninhabited the canons along the south-western boundary of Colorado, and\r\nare considered the ancestors of the pueblo-building Indians whose\r\nterraced community-houses crown isolated buttes in the midst of the\r\nArizona deserts and along the Rio Grande, a more effective mode of\r\nrepresentation has been adopted. Upon several of the large hall-tables\r\nwill be seen, under glass, models in plaster, colored with exactness, of\r\nthose great houses and all their externals. These models were made by\r\nMessrs. Jackson and Holmes, of the United States Geological Survey, and\r\nare wonderfully truthful and instructive. A similar plan has been\r\nadopted in a few other cases to show savage architecture, and it has\r\nproved so effective and interesting that its use should be extended. The\r\nlittle model of a lacustrine village restored from the vestiges\r\ndiscovered in the Swiss lakes gives one a better notion of how the\r\nlake-dwellers really conducted their peaceful life and guarded\r\nthemselves against their savage enemies of the forest and mountains\r\nthan any amount of verbal description could do.\r\n\r\nBeyond any one of these in importance as a source of mementos\r\nillustrating the life and art of the aborigines is the burial-place. Not\r\nonly do well-recognized graves and cemeteries yield valuable material\r\nwhenever explored, but a large part of that gathered in ploughed fields\r\nand on ancient town-sites was undoubtedly put there with the dead, or as\r\na subsequent offering. Nothing is more fortunate for the science of\r\narchaeology than that the primitive Americans held the notions they did\r\nrespecting death and the hereafter; for through these theories and the\r\npractices to which they gave rise an enormous amount of material has\r\nbeen preserved to us which otherwise would have been lost. It is not too\r\nmuch to say, I feel sure, that were all other traces of prehistoric\r\nAmerica obliterated from our knowledge and possession save that which\r\nhas been and may be derived from burial-places, we might still\r\nreconstruct nearly as complete a picture as can now be outlined.\r\n\r\nThe modes of disposal of the dead were various among the native races of\r\nAmerica, and most of them may be matched by customs obtaining in the\r\nEastern hemisphere or the Polynesian islands. The commonest method was\r\nsome form of _inhumation_ in pits, graves, or holes in the ground, in\r\nstone graves or cysts, in mounds, beneath or in houses, or in caves.\r\n_Embalmment_, to a limited extent, was also practised, the corpse being\r\nwrapped in garments and made up into a bundle before being placed in the\r\nearth, a cave, charnel-house, or in a box mounted on a scaffold.\r\n_Surface-burial_ was in use in some districts, the corpse being placed\r\nin a pen, a hollow tree or log, or simply covered with loose earth, or\r\nbark, or rocks forming cairns. In several regions, at various times,\r\n_cremation_ was the rule, or at least a partial burning, the resulting\r\nbones and ashes being preserved by some tribes and scattered by others.\r\n_Aerial sepulture_ is the name given to another method, where the body\r\nwas left in the cabin or wigwam, deposited on scaffolds or trees, in\r\nboxes or canoes, sometimes supported by posts, sometimes resting on the\r\nground, placed in baskets perched on pinnacles of rock or hung to the\r\nbranches of trees,--the last being the mode often adopted in the case of\r\nchildren. Lastly, some nations were accustomed to sink their dead\r\nbeneath the water, or turn them adrift in canoes.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that many of these practices could not be shown, from the\r\nnature of the case or the limits of space, except by pictures or models;\r\nbut certain forms are represented in the great stocking-foot-shaped jars\r\nof coarse earthenware which served as coffins in the Nicaraguan region,\r\nin cinerary urns, in bones and skulls prepared to be kept as a sacred\r\nheirloom in the family, and in various descriptions of mummies, swathed\r\nand unswathed, chiefly from Peru and from caves in Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt has always been the habit of savage and semi-barbarous people, the\r\nworld over, to bury with their dead or destroy at the grave more or less\r\nproperty which may or may not have belonged to the deceased persons.\r\nAmong some of the American Indians this was carried to such an extent as\r\nutterly to impoverish all the relatives, who, in fact, seem to have\r\naccumulated wealth solely for the purpose of funereal display. By a few\r\ntribes, like the Natchez, human sacrifice--forcibly of slaves,\r\nvoluntarily on the part of relatives--was enjoined whenever a prominent\r\nman died. In most nations, however, the sacrifices were limited to\r\nhorses, dogs, and food-animals, ornaments and implements. It was\r\nbelieved that in the spirit-land to which the soul was going this\r\nproperty would be of service and these slaves and wives and various\r\nobjects would be necessary in order that the dead man might be well\r\nfitted to pursue his immortal journey. Therefore, when a grave is opened\r\nor any form of burial-place is found by the archaeologist, he is almost\r\nsure to obtain a quantity of imperishable property,--weapons and\r\nornaments of stone, bone, or metal, clay food-dishes, and the\r\nlike,--the history of which is identified with that of the deceased and\r\ntells his story.\r\n\r\nTwo classes of burial-places have been the subject of special\r\nexploration and study by this museum, generally under the personal\r\nsupervision of Professor Putnam, or of Mr. Lucien Carr, his assistant.\r\nOne of these are the strange stone cysts of Tennessee, which occur in\r\nthousands in the Cumberland valley. They were from two to four feet\r\nbelow the surface, and were made of large slabs of stone, placed\r\nedgewise to form the sides and ends, on which other flat stones rested,\r\nforming the top of the grave. The bottoms of these cysts were sometimes\r\nlined with small stones, oftener with large potsherds, while in some\r\ninstances the lining was probably of bark. While most of the cysts\r\ncontained only a single body, two, three, and even five skeletons were\r\nfound together in a few instances. Each grave held a greater or less\r\nquantity and variety of articles of native manufacture. Stone implements\r\nwere rarer than is customary elsewhere, but those present were unusually\r\nfine. One of the skeletons had a stone arrow-head embedded in the spine.\r\nThe pottery was more abundant, and consisted for the most part of\r\nwell-made water-bottles and food-dishes, ornamented by incised lines or\r\ndesigns in color. Implements and ornaments of bone, stone, and shell,\r\nbeads of terra-cotta and shell, small mollusks perforated for stringing,\r\na few carved pipes of pottery, stone, etc., were also gathered and\r\nbrought to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nWhile cemeteries of this character are known to have extended over wide\r\nareas of lowland, stone graves were also built into low pyramids by\r\nplacing one tier on top of another until from four to six had been laid.\r\nEach tier as completed--probably each grave as added--would be covered\r\nwith earth, so that the whole formed a burial-mound fifty feet or more\r\nin diameter and eight or ten feet high (the bottom tier of graves being\r\nsunken), containing perhaps two hundred bodies. Not only within the\r\ncysts, but on and around the stones throughout the mound, were exhumed\r\nmany relics, especially of pottery, showing that food and offerings had\r\nbeen laid upon the graves after they were closed. Nowhere was there the\r\nleast indication of any contact with Europeans; and these cemeteries\r\nundoubtedly antedate the coming of the whites.\r\n\r\nAmong the most strikingly interesting discoveries made during the past\r\nfew years is the burial-place in the Miami valley of Ohio, with its\r\nhundreds of singular pits dug in the hard clay below the leaf-mould in\r\nwhich the skeletons are found. This place was discovered by the members\r\nof the Madisonville Literary and Scientific Society, which, during three\r\nor four years, carried on an exploration under the personal direction of\r\nDr. C. L. Metz. In 1880 the Peabody Museum was invited to join in the\r\nexploration, and Professor Putnam visited the locality soon afterward.\r\nThe result of this co-operation is apparent in the large collections\r\nbrought to the museum, where the contents of several of these strange\r\npits are shown, as well as thousands of objects obtained from others or\r\noccurring with the skeletons in the leaf-mould. More than fifteen\r\nhundred pits and a thousand skeletons have now been uncovered and\r\nexamined, several acres having been dug over, foot by foot, with\r\npainstaking completeness.\r\n\r\nThe pits, hollowed out of the underlying clay, are from two to seven\r\nfeet in depth, and about four feet in diameter, hidden under a stratum\r\nof slowly-accumulated leaf-mould two feet thick. The majority of them,\r\nevidently, had been made previous to the burial of the bodies, though\r\nsome were more recent than a few of the graves. The labor expended in\r\ndigging them, and the peculiar character of their contents, render it\r\nnot improbable that they were made in pursuance of some superstition or\r\nas part of a religious rite. This is an unsatisfactory generality, but\r\nmore cannot yet be said with safety.\r\n\r\nThe average pit may be said to be filled with ashes in more or less\r\nwell-defined layers. Near the top there may be a mixture of gravel, but\r\nunderneath are found only fine gray ashes to the depth of one or two\r\nfeet, in which often occur thin strata of charcoal or sand, while at the\r\nbottom burnt stones have often been found. Throughout the whole mass of\r\nashes and sand, from top to bottom, are bones of fishes, reptiles,\r\nbirds, and mammals. The larger bones, such as those of the elk, deer,\r\nand bear, are broken; and all, apparently, are those of animals used for\r\nfood. With the bones are always many shells of fresh-water mussels\r\n(_Unionidae_), the more massive of which have a large circular piece cut\r\nout near the centre. Fragments of pottery (rarely a whole vessel) also\r\nabound in each pit, quantities of implements made of bones and antlers,\r\nsome forms of which are unlike anything known elsewhere, implements of\r\nchipped and polished stone, pipes carved in various shapes from stone,\r\nand objects of copper. In some pits several bushels of charred corn,\r\nwhich had been covered with bark matting, lay underneath the ashes; and\r\nin three instances human skeletons, or parts of skeletons, have been\r\nfound in the pits,--a fact which seems to have no special significance.\r\n\r\nOn the hill-side near this great cemetery is to be seen what doubtless\r\nis the site of the permanent village of the people who made the\r\nash-pits. This site is indicated by several earth-circles, the\r\nexplorations of which, prosecuted by means of trenches, revealed in the\r\ncentre, upon the hard clay, beneath about two feet of accumulated\r\nleaf-mould, fireplaces made of large stones, enclosing beds of ashes\r\nmingled with potsherds, flint-flakes, burnt bones, and perforated shells\r\nlike those in the pits. The few things disclosed within the circles, and\r\nthe abundance of household-utensils and refuse found in the ashes in the\r\npits, suggest the possibility that on special occasions all the articles\r\nin the house, with ornaments, weapons, and other personal property, were\r\npartly destroyed by fire, gathered up with the ashes, and deposited in a\r\npit dug for the purpose, while the great number of broken bones of\r\nvarious animals indicates that at such times feasts were held. A custom\r\nlike this, which is quite consistent with the Indian character as\r\nmanifested within the historic period, would account for the character\r\nof the contents of the pits, while their great number would indicate a\r\nlong-continued occupation of the village.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of American archaeology remains to be considered. It is\r\nrepresented in the museum by a unique and most interesting series of\r\nspecimens illustrating every detail with the greatest particularity and\r\nexactness, so that future students need lose no essential feature of the\r\npicture that lay before the original explorers and describers. In the\r\nnortheastern part of Anderson township, near the Little Miami River, a\r\ngroup of earth-works exist which are among the most remarkable of all\r\nthe thousands scattered throughout the Ohio valley. The owner gave to\r\nthe museum the exclusive right of exploration, and the locality was\r\nmapped and investigated with that scientific care which alone can give\r\nthe results entire credibility and value. Several of the thirteen mounds\r\nwithin one of the encircling walls contained basins or \"altars\" of\r\nburned clay, on two of which were literally thousands of objects of\r\ninterest, embracing forms unlike anything known before, and exhibiting\r\nan unsuspected degree of cultivation in their makers,--cultivation\r\nwhich, it is fair to suppose, could have been arrived at only after a\r\nlong period of peaceful and prosperous life in the community. I have\r\nspace to mention only a few of these articles.\r\n\r\nOne altar contained about two bushels of ornaments made of stone, mica,\r\nshells, pearls, and the teeth of bears and other animals. Pearls were so\r\nplentiful, indeed, that as many as sixty thousand are in the possession\r\nof the museum. They seem to have been derived mainly, if not wholly,\r\nfrom the fresh-water mussels, and are of all shapes and sizes, out of\r\nwhich might be selected hundreds of perfect spheres, from the size of\r\nbird-shot to that of a cherry. What splendid necklaces must the latter\r\nhave made! But, alas for the mercenary collector, all are ruined by\r\nfire,--a fact advantageous to science. Like nearly all the other\r\nobjects, every pearl is perforated for suspension.\r\n\r\nArticles of copper are none too common anywhere, and the collection of\r\nrelics hammered from that native metal (which must have been obtained,\r\nthrough barter, from the tribes that mined it on Lake Superior, showing\r\nhow extensive were the tradings of those days) has not only thrown much\r\nlight on this branch of ancient art and craftsmanship in America\r\ngenerally, but added some peculiar forms to the museum's stock, chiefly\r\nin the line of pendent ornaments. One of the forms procured, represented\r\nby many specimens, was a spool-shaped ear-ring: something like it had\r\nbeen seen heretofore, but its purpose had been a mystery. Several of the\r\nornaments of copper were covered with native silver, which had been\r\nhammered out into thin sheets and folded over the copper. A few were\r\nsimilarly covered with gold; and this is the first time this metal has\r\nbeen found in the mounds.\r\n\r\nThis would show that beauty was highly appreciated by the natives of the\r\nLittle Miami valley, say, a thousand years ago. That they had a real\r\nregard for art, in advance of what has usually been accorded to the red\r\nmen of the Northern States, is evident from other contents of these two\r\naltar-mounds. One altar contained several sheets of mica and thin plates\r\nof copper out of which had been cut some designs in scroll-work which\r\nfor symmetry and elegance of curve merit a high place; also heads of\r\nanimals and a grotesque human profile, which are of less worth, but\r\nnotable in the dearth heretofore of things of that sort among _relicta_\r\nfrom the mounds.\r\n\r\nFar in advance of these, however, are the figurines of terra-cotta found\r\non another altar. They had all been badly burnt, and many of them seemed\r\nto have been broken purposely before being placed upon the altar; but it\r\nhas been found possible to unite many pieces, and enough remains to\r\nshow at a glance the great importance these small and graceful human\r\nimages will have in the study of early American art. They are from four\r\nto six inches in height, partly nude, and carefully moulded in regard to\r\nanatomy. The method of wearing the hair, the use of the button-like or\r\nspool-shaped ear-rings, the expression of the features, etc., are all in\r\nthe highest degree instructive, while the whole effect is pleasing and\r\nartistic. Associated with them were two remarkable dishes carved from\r\nstone, in the shape of animals, showing an unusual degree of skill and\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nA discovery in the same mounds which interests scientific men even more\r\nthan this, or than anything else has done for a long time, is the\r\nfinding in these mounds of quantities of meteoric iron. It was said by\r\nHildreth (\"Archaeologia Americana,\" i., 1820, page 163) that traces of\r\niron-work had been found in a mound at Marietta, Ohio; but a\r\nre-examination of the specimens preserved at Worcester showed that they\r\nwere of oxidized copper. The present discovery was therefore the first\r\nof its kind, and excited so much interest that chemists and\r\nmineralogists have been called into council with the archaeologists on\r\nthe subject. This is the only kind of crude iron that is malleable; and\r\nthat the people who built the mounds, or any other of the native races\r\nof the United States, had any knowledge of working iron-ore, yet remains\r\nto be shown. Some of the iron was in its original shape,--unworked\r\nnodules; a part in solid bars, etc.; but much of it had been treated\r\nlike silver,--that is, hammered into sheets and used in thin plates as\r\nan ornamental covering for ear-rings and pendants. The mixture of nickel\r\nin this meteoric iron has not only preserved it, but caused a polished\r\nsurface to gleam white, as though plated with silver, while tarnishing\r\nless easily than that metal. No doubt it was among the most highly\r\nprized of all the treasures of those old days, and nothing more precious\r\nthan this could have been offered as a sacrifice, when, with lavish\r\nhand, pearls and silver and gold, weapons and tools, household furniture\r\nand products of the chase and the farm, were heaped upon the funeral\r\npyre or contributed to the sacrificial flame.\r\n\r\nIn materials illustrating the life and crafts of the Indians during the\r\nlast century and at present, this museum is not yet so well supplied as\r\nsome others,--that at Washington, for example, which has been\r\nconstituted the depository for the collections of scores of government\r\nexpeditions into the West and North. Nevertheless, some things of great\r\nvalue and completeness in this way are already owned. Thus, in the South\r\nAmerican room may be seen a series of specimens illustrating the whole\r\noperation of pottery-making among the Caribs of British Guiana. This was\r\nobtained several years ago by Professor H. A. Ward, who bought the\r\nentire stock of materials of a woman of that tribe whom he found at\r\nwork. These consisted of a mass of clay ready for the potter, a number\r\nof vessels ready for the fire, others which had been burned, and several\r\nornamented in colors. The gourd scrapers of several shapes, with which\r\nshe smoothed the vessels, small, smooth stones used in polishing the raw\r\ncolors, and other appurtenances, are included, together with toy vessels\r\nwhich the woman hastily pinched into shape and gave to her children as\r\nplaythings to amuse them while she worked, the forms of which help to\r\nexplain many similar articles found in ancient graves.\r\n\r\nWith like completeness, when Dr. E. Palmer was exploring for the museum\r\nthe nitre-caves in Northern Mexico, anciently occupied as places of\r\nhuman sepulture, he sent with the \"mummies\" extracted from them a full\r\nseries of such natural products of the vicinity as would enable the\r\nmuseum to exhibit the leaves, fibres, and other vegetable productions\r\nfrom which the cloth, baskets, and so forth were constructed by the\r\npeople who placed their dead in the caves. Dr. Palmer also sent a full\r\nset of the rude apparatus by which the present Indians of Mexico make\r\ntheir cactus-cakes and syrup, from the thorn-tipped pole with which the\r\nprickly fruit is gathered to the great earthen colanders through which\r\nit is strained; also all the implements and utensils, the native still,\r\netc., used in making _pulque_ and in preparing and weaving the fibre of\r\nthe agave.\r\n\r\nTo go with greater detail into the treasures of this remarkable\r\ncollection, whose value is so great, not only historically, but in an\r\neducational aspect (since it is readily accessible throughout and\r\ninstructively presented), is forbidden by the limits of space; but the\r\ntemptation to transgress is strong. I have said nothing, for example, of\r\nthe great series of crania, now many times larger than when Wyman\r\nprinted his papers in the early reports. A portion of this collection\r\nhas more recently been described by Mr. Lucien Carr, whose voluntary\r\nservices as an assistant at the museum have been of inestimable\r\nadvantage to it. I have alluded only incidentally to the department of\r\nceramics, which contains what is unquestionably the most important lot\r\nof material ever brought together for the investigation of the history\r\nand progress of the potter's art on the Western continent, from the\r\n\"cord-marked\" potsherds of the shell-heaps to the fanciful creations of\r\nMexico and Peru.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, to summarize briefly what this essay has said,\r\nthat the trustees of the Peabody Museum have secured to the public a\r\nfire-proof building containing nearly four hundred thousand specimens\r\nillustrating human progress in the \"childhood of the world;\" and these\r\nhave been placed under proper care and arranged in accordance with the\r\ndemands of modern anthropological science. An instructive and attractive\r\nmuseum has been formed in this way, where, from time to time, free\r\ndescriptive lectures are given by the curator, and whither students may\r\ngo for special investigations with the assurance that, so far as America\r\nis concerned, they have access to the most important collections that\r\nhave been brought together, while material for comparison with the\r\nantiquities of other parts of the globe is not wanting.\r\n\r\nERNEST INGERSOLL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NORTH-RIVER FERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid the reader ever realize how important a part the ferry and the ford\r\nhave played in human affairs? How differently would history read without\r\nits Caesar crossing the Rubicon, its Xerxes crossing the Hellespont, and\r\nits Washington crossing the Delaware, its Paul Revere wherried across\r\nthe Charles, and its Burr and Hamilton ferried over to Weehawken,--not\r\nto speak of the Hebrews going over Jordan, Jacob at the brook Jabbok,\r\nand John the Baptist at the fords of Bethabara! The ancients conceived\r\nof death under the figure of a ferry, and transmitted it to us with such\r\nvividness that we are still half pagan in our imagination. And I can\r\neasily believe that the battle of life may be essentially influenced by\r\nhaving a river to cross each day. The change from land to water, from\r\nnarrow and stony streets to the wide, free outlook and uplook of a great\r\nriver, the varied life of a crowded ferry-boat and of a busy harbor, the\r\nmagnetic sympathies of a multitude let loose from toil and perforce at a\r\nstand-still for the time,--all this insures a transition of mind as well\r\nas transfer of body. I could appreciate the exclamation of an impulsive\r\nEnglish girl while waiting one sultry day on a North-River pier, as she\r\nspread open her arms and rushed to the edge of the dock: \"I feel as if\r\nI'd like to take a barth!\" It was not the dirty scum under the piles\r\nthat set her longing, but the general sense of refreshment which the\r\nbroad and breezy river suggested to her imagination. Why should not\r\nthose tides wash out some of the lines which a day in the city has left\r\nto deepen on a man's mind and brow?--especially if he pushes on to\r\n\"sweet fields beyond the swelling flood\" and enters \"that dear hut,\" his\r\nhome, under a vine-wreathed porch and along a gravel walk through a\r\ngrassy lawn, and not down \"area steps,\" or even through the ponderous\r\nand marble jaws of some city \"palace.\" Therefore it is that the suburban\r\nhath the promise, above his mewed-up fellow-citizen, that his days shall\r\nbe long in the land which the Lord God giveth him. And hence even the\r\nnarrow-neckedness of land which distinguishes New York and pushes most\r\nof its population over the sides may have its compensations.\r\n\r\nThe ferry makes itself felt long before one gets there. There is a sort\r\nof undertow in the city tides far up from the river-front. There is a\r\ngreater tangle of travel as you approach the streets leading to the\r\nferry. There is a perceptible assimilation of trade to the supposed\r\ndemands of householders living out of town. The retail Mammon dethrones\r\nhis proud wholesale rival. The sidewalk- or gutter-stand thrusts itself\r\nout in advance of the store. The peripatetic dealer in small wares, the\r\nnewsboy, the apple-woman, the bootblack, and the mendicant marshal you\r\nthe way. The whole vicinity acquires the look and stir of a bazaar.\r\nBaskets and paper parcels and travelling-bags are conspicuous and\r\ngeneral. Perhaps you find yourself on the greasy edge of some huge\r\nmarket. The hacks accumulate like croton-bugs about a kitchen sink. You\r\nfeel as if you were being sucked into some valve or vortex.\r\n\r\nThere is a test of character in the mode of going to the ferry. It is\r\nalmost impossible not to be in a hurry, such is the swirl of the tide in\r\nwhich you find yourself. In my three years of almost daily transit I\r\nnever ceased to revere the moral superiority of the admirable few who\r\nday after day could proceed with leisurely step and serene brow amid\r\nthe heated, breathless, tugging, anxious multitude. It seemed to\r\nindicate a steadiness of nerve, a systematic habit, a wise and\r\ndeliberate forecast, a self-control and self-confidence, and a belief in\r\ntheir watches, to which I never hope to attain this side of Old Charon's\r\nferry itself. And yet somebody is nearly always late. Quite as likely,\r\nhowever, it is somebody who is too early,--because he really belongs to\r\nthe next boat, and not to the one which is just leaving the dock as he\r\ntears into the ferry-house.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of condensed life and human nature to be found at a\r\nferry by one who himself is in no hurry to cross. Take your stand just\r\nwhere you can see up the street and at the same time can command the\r\nwhole interior. The waiting-room is deserted, except by some such\r\nlounger as yourself, or a passenger left by the last boat or \"too\r\nprevious\" for the next. Well for you if you are sufficiently respectable\r\nto pass muster with the official whose duty it is to see that no one\r\nsecures a day's lodging for two cents. There is a slow dribble of\r\nwayfarers, who seldom spend their time in the dismal and dingy\r\nwaiting-room unless in very cold weather or to stand guard over their\r\nparcels which they have piled upon the seats. But all at once\r\n(especially if the next boat is to connect with some train on the other\r\nside) you observe a thickening of the living current far up the\r\nsidewalk, as when the gutters are swollen by the turning on of a\r\nhydrant. Down comes the hurrying mass, fretting at the manifold\r\nobstructions, its component parts struggling together and almost seeming\r\nto go over each other's heads. No time now for the small courtesies, or\r\neven charities, of life. The sturdy and malodorous beggar knows too well\r\nto run alongside with his \"Help a poor boy; I'm a stranger in the city.\"\r\nAnd the man whose abridged and distorted legs are his stock in trade\r\nwaits for the return-tide to enact his shrewd and pantomimic\r\nmorality-play by a hurried shuffle up and down the pavement. The\r\nnews-dealers--even the enterprising female who summons mercy to the aid\r\nof commerce by her absurdly lugubrious visage--have the paper and the\r\nchange all ready to thrust into their customer's hand. The scene at the\r\ncrossing of the street baffles description. Talk of the day of miracles\r\nbeing past! One who can watch this scene of scare and scamper and\r\nhair-breadth escape and not believe in a particular Providence must be\r\nincorrigibly heterodox.\r\n\r\nThe tide reaches the outer gate in a state of lively congestion. The\r\nperson in front of you as you pass the toll-taker's booth is quite sure\r\nto have forgotten his ticket, and has to set down his parcels while he\r\nfumbles through all his pockets for it. You are sure you hear the inner\r\ngate closing. You dash through the ferry-house in the most undignified\r\nmanner and unphilosophic mood--to find that you have five minutes to\r\nspare! And you take your stand beside your double, who has been all this\r\ntime enjoying the little woes and absurdities of others,--including\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nThe current has hardly slackened when the long gate begins to roll to.\r\nThe last passenger has to edge himself through sideways, at some peril\r\nof his packages if not of himself, and at the tender mercy of the\r\ngate-keeper. Not the last would-be passenger, however; for a frantic\r\nform is seen to dart through the narrow and tortuous pass from the\r\nstreet and fling itself upon the closed barrier, appealing in eloquent\r\nindignation to the inexorable Cerberus, and then gazing, with face\r\nagainst the lattice, in imbecile despair at the receding boat.\r\nSimultaneous with the thud of the shutting gate is the clank of chains\r\nand the rattle of clamps and clogs, as of the striking off of fetters\r\nand handcuffs, an asthmatic jingle of a bell somewhere in the body of\r\nthe boat, a slight slush of revolving paddle-wheels, and the great\r\nbrute, as steady as a spirit-level and as powerful as a battering-ram,\r\nseparates itself from the dock like the opening blade of a penknife. You\r\nrecall the good old days when there were no cruelly-humane gates, and\r\nwhen this stage of the proceeding was marked by a wild leap of belated\r\nforms across the widening chasm, with now and then the souse of a\r\nmiscalculating passenger into the yeasty brine. The scene is less\r\npicturesque and exciting now, but it is decidedly more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIf you have a wise regard for your sanitary well-being, you will remain\r\non deck, alike to saturate your lungs with torrents of oxygen and to let\r\nyour weary eye and mind disport themselves like sea-gulls on the broad\r\nwaters of the bay. What so fresh and cool and clean and still and\r\nsparkling and in perfect contrast to the stern and stony and resounding\r\nstreets! As you lean over the taffrail, looking down into the clear,\r\ngliding wave, you can readily conceive why the poor unfortunates to whom\r\nlife has become a stern and stony street are so often tempted to bury\r\ntheir sorrows in that great calm grave.\r\n\r\nI never grow tired of watching the wake of the vessel. It revives some\r\nof my earliest impressions,--all the more if it be upon the venerable\r\nWiehawken, or James Rumsey, or some other veteran of the Hoboken line,\r\nthat used to convey me across the Hudson in my childish days. A\r\nferry-boat then meant to me a country boy's visit to the great city, or,\r\na little later, a city boy's holiday-excursion to the Elysian Fields.\r\nThe long vibrations of the laboring boat bring back the old thrill of\r\nexcited expectation. Even the discordant clank of the dock-gear is\r\nmusical in memory's ear. And at any time of life there is a real\r\nfascination in watching the smooth and soapy track unrolling behind us,\r\nwith its sharp division-line in the centre and its upturned depths of\r\nglossy green.\r\n\r\nEvery harbor has its characteristic features. The harbor of New York\r\ngives, first of all, the impression of amplitude. This means not only\r\nplenty of \"elbow-room\" upon the water, but of shore-room. The depots of\r\na continent could be conveniently clustered here, and its fleets perform\r\ntheir tactics. There was nothing mean in Nature's mood when she planned\r\nthe harbor of New York. And, after all that mellow time and\r\nconsecrating tradition, the traveller's enthusiasm, the poet's fancy,\r\nand the painter's sleight have done for the beauties of the Bosphorus,\r\nthe Bay of Naples, the harbor of Rhodes, and other \"fine old ports\" and\r\n\"gems of the first water,\" I know of few more picturesque effects,\r\nwhether of color or of grouping, than that which the North-River\r\nferry-boat affords its passengers as midway in the stream they look up\r\nthe broad palisaded river, or down the islanded bay, or across on either\r\nside at populous and steepled shores, on a golden October afternoon or\r\nin the breezy light of a winter morning. Here is, at least, none of the\r\nmonotony of charm, like the stereotyped features of a placid and\r\npassionless beauty, which characterizes your standard harbor-scenes. New\r\nYork may not be as classic or correct as her languishing rivals on the\r\nHellespont or the blue waters of the Mediterranean, but she has the\r\nfascination arising from mobility of feature, endless variety of\r\nexpression, and vivacity of mood. One who daily crosses the North River\r\nfor a year will have seemed to belt the globe and voyaged through all\r\nzones. He will have danced upon the sparkling waves of the AEgean, groped\r\nthrough the fogs of Liverpool, sweltered in the sultry glare of Tunis,\r\nskirted the ice-clad shores of Scandinavia, sickened in the surges of\r\nthe Channel, lain glassed in the watery mirror of the China Sea. And he\r\nwill have observed striking features peculiar to this latitude of the\r\nAtlantic coast. I recall an atmospheric effect in springtime resembling\r\na light pearl-colored mist, which had none of the qualities of a fog,\r\nbut rather lent a weird transparency to the air. It gave the impression\r\nof sunlight faded or washed of its golden particles, or of a picture\r\ndrawn on pearl. There was a statuesque stillness about the water, a near\r\nand yet a far look about the entire scene, which imparted a sense of\r\nunreality, almost of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of fogs on the river. Their prevalence differs greatly in\r\ndifferent years, also their density and darkness. The East River, from\r\nits narrowness, its crowded condition, and its rapid current, is far\r\nmore obstructed by them; but the Bridge has changed all that. The fogs\r\nare to be charged to the serious discount of suburban life; still more\r\nthe snow-storms, which are more deadening to sound and less capable of\r\nillumination. But the use of electric light and the vast capacities of\r\nthe steam-whistle and fog-horn, not to speak of the more than Indian\r\nexpertness to which a pilot's eye and ear can be trained, have reduced\r\nthe inconvenience to a minimum. There is, however, to the imaginative\r\ntraveller a compensating, albeit an awful, charm. It is like exploring\r\nsome dim and echoing cave resounding with an organ-concert played by\r\nTitans on the very instruments of AEolus himself. The whole river makes\r\none think of a vast shell, full of the boomings and sighings of an\r\ninfinite sea.\r\n\r\nBut such experiences on the North River are rare, even in times of fog\r\nor snow. For the most part the climate of New York harbor is singularly\r\nclear, and its autumns are beginning to be recognized as a\r\nmeteorological masterpiece. And its vast and varied commerce offers\r\nexhaustless entertainment for one who has an eye for the picturesque or\r\na sympathetic imagination for the living freight.\r\n\r\nAs we look up and down the bay we realize how thoroughly steam has\r\ncleared the water of sails, sadly to the sacrifice of beauty. Here and\r\nthere, however, there is a lingering sloop or schooner, engaged in\r\nriver- or coasting-trade. Decidedly old-fashioned they look, like the\r\nwhite turban and neckerchief of our grandmothers. As they lie off there,\r\nnestling so confidingly in the arms of the great river-god, we seem to\r\nget a glimpse of a simpler and serener age, when life glided rather than\r\npushed, waited on the heavenly influences and trusted not its own\r\nimpulse. I know that the life of a deck-hand will not bear a very close\r\nexamination for aesthetic purposes. But, as I watch these vessels\r\ndrifting down through the golden afternoon, or cheerily beating up\r\nagainst the tide on a breezy morning, the man at the wheel is a very\r\nmodel of unconscious grace and almost effortless ascendency; and his\r\nshipmates, grouped about him like floating lotos-eaters, have ever a\r\ntouch of the fine old Ulyssean vagrancy. Now and then there stands out\r\nbefore the breeze and the sunlight a great canvassed ship, like some\r\nliving thing fluttering and glowing and careering under their thrilling\r\ntouch. And sometimes a fleet of sailing-yachts, more beautiful and swift\r\nthan sea-gulls, will hover on the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt is with something of sadness, if not of regret, that we turn our eyes\r\nfrom these lovely and now almost phantom forms to the monstrosities of\r\nsteam navigation. I think we are passing through a sort of saurian epoch\r\nin this age of steam. When we have outgrown this clumsy, noisy, perilous\r\nagent, and have adjusted ourselves to electricity or some still more\r\nsubtile and commodious force, we may be able to restore somewhat of the\r\ngraces of form and motion. And we shall then look back upon the hideous\r\nand awkward craft of this day very much as we now gaze upon a\r\nreproduction of the misshapen and unwieldy monsters of the palaeozoic\r\nages. The river swarms with ferry-boats. Was ever utility attained at so\r\ngreat a sacrifice of taste? Their model must have been a toad with a\r\nstick thrust through it (three of which, so impaled and hung up in the\r\nsun to dry, Luther recommended as the best cure for all manner of\r\n\"pestilent humors\"). At any rate, the difference between their aspect\r\nand that of the sail-boat is that of a beetle and a butterfly. The acme\r\nof ugliness is reached in the freight ferry-boats, floating fragments of\r\nrailroad, whose cars look like the joints of a monstrous creeping worm.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, can complain of any want of variety in these\r\nsteam-craft, whether in size or in shape, from the rather stately\r\nsteamships to the little tug-boats that shoot to and fro like gnats upon\r\nthe surface of a pool. I say _rather_ stately, for the high and graceful\r\nhull of the steamer comes to a lame and impotent conclusion in its squat\r\nchimney, like a large-faced man with a mayhemed nose, and in its toy\r\nmasts and rigging, like a stout woman with curl-papers or a thin wisp of\r\nringlet. When two or three of these steamships are together down the\r\nharbor, their white volleys of smoke often present quite a lively\r\npicture of a naval engagement. The little puffing pilot-boats have a\r\ntrick of getting in the way of us ferry-voyagers, like fussy\r\ncustom-house officers among the newly-landed passengers from the\r\nocean-ferries. There is generally a tug, perhaps with a slow convoy, to\r\nbe waited for or circumnavigated ere the \"slip\" can be entered. And they\r\nrun so close in-shore that the pilot has to be wary, and in some cases\r\nto emerge with a series of unearthly steam screeches, lest he step upon\r\none of them with his great \"horseshoe\" of a ferry-boat. The steam-yacht\r\nis the most graceful as well as agile of the species, as certainly it\r\nought to be when as much money is sometimes put into one as would buy a\r\nRaphael or build a Grecian temple. The steam-yacht has doubtless a\r\nthousand comforts for the owner above the sailing-yacht, but we, whose\r\ninterest in them is an outside and aesthetic one, cannot help saying, \"O\r\nUtility, what crimes are committed in thy name!\"\r\n\r\nThere is no beauty, but a deal of attraction, in the great flotillas of\r\nlinked barges and canal-boats which slowly pass like floating and vulgar\r\nVenices. If, as is often the case, they lie across the track, we shall\r\nhave plenty of opportunity to observe at our leisure their still life. I\r\nhave always thought that canal-life--by reason of its amphibiousness,\r\nits phenomenal slowness, its monotony amid endless change, its solitude\r\namid busy and peopled scenes which it is always touching but never\r\nentering--must be a unique existence, a _modus vivendi_ quite apart from\r\nother human experiences by land or sea. A distinct type of character and\r\nof habit cannot fail to be evolved, which it might be well for ingenious\r\nnovelists at their wits' ends to study, even though it required a trial\r\nof patience and a tribulation of stomach and cuticle for a voyage or\r\ntwo. Dickens saw its possibilities, and made it an episode in Little\r\nNell's wanderings, and I am rather surprised that he did not work the\r\nvein farther.\r\n\r\nThe river-barge is freighted for me with pleasant memories. Like\r\nCleopatra's,\r\n\r\n          From the barge\r\n  A strange invisible perfume hits the sense.\r\n\r\nThere are not many of them now that carry passengers, but in my boyhood\r\nthey were a common vehicle of travel on the Hudson, several of these\r\nshapeless and unwieldy tubs being lashed to the sides or dragged at the\r\nstern of a tow-boat. They are identified with summer vacations in the\r\ncountry, than which a boy's memory holds no more honeyed recollections.\r\nThe hours before \"turning in\" (the very fact of an abnormal night and\r\nbed was a joy to the juvenile mind, despite the incessant and unearthly\r\nnoises of the live-stock on board) were spent in wandering among the\r\nmountains of \"produce,\" inhaling the savor of Orange County butter and\r\nbaled hay and meal-bags, and listening to the plaintive bleat of\r\ncomfortless calves and desolate sheep. As night drew on, I would select\r\nsome snug little nook, where I could lie and dream as we glided along\r\nthe still and starlit river, through the Highlands, perhaps, or the\r\nPalisades. The charm was mainly, of course, in the spell of youthful\r\nfancy and expectancy, which touched and transfigured the homely scene,\r\nas the moonlight touched and transfigured the silent river. But I\r\nassociate it all with the barges, and shall ever see in those uncouth\r\ncraft\r\n\r\n          Argosies of magic sails,\r\n  Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales.\r\n\r\nIn summer the excursion-boats add picturesqueness and a festive air to\r\nthe river, with their gay bunting and bands of music and salutes with\r\nbell or steam-whistle, and, above all, their eager throngs of\r\nSunday-school children or the liberated denizens of foul and narrow\r\nstreets. At times the shipping along the docks and over the bay will\r\nblossom with the flags and streamers of all nations, hung fore and aft\r\nand extending in fluttering lines down the rigging, imparting a gala\r\naspect to the scene and perhaps thrilling one with patriotic or historic\r\nmemories. Perhaps we are crossing at the moment when the great\r\nSound-steamers are pushing out from their piers. We feel quite\r\nhumiliated on our lonely ferry-boat as these leviathans of nautical\r\narchitecture sweep past us with an imperious curve far out into the\r\nstream, and then move steadily and statelily down the middle of the\r\nriver, like an \"ugly duckling\" of mammoth proportions. One never gets\r\nover the sensation of that sight, nor its impressions as a type of our\r\ncentury,--a vast floating hotel, carrying the population of a village\r\nand the luxurious appointments of a palace, gliding as smoothly and\r\nnoiselessly as an Indian's canoe, and propelled by an internal force\r\napparently as vital and secret as that which moves the Indian's arm.\r\n\r\nYonder comes an ocean-steamer, long, low, and black, with a tri-color\r\nflag at the stern, slowly and puffily tugged by a little pilot-boat. The\r\ndecks literally swarm with figures in all sorts of outlandish\r\ngarb,--gray and blue stuffs, long shaggy ulsters, Scotch caps and\r\nplaids, gay kerchiefs on the women's heads and necks. Some lounge,\r\nsmoking or gibbering, over the taffrail, other groups sit picturesquely\r\non their large rude boxes, but most of them are suggestively silent and\r\nstatuesque. And well they may be, for it is the moment of fate to the\r\npoor emigrant as much as for Columbus when he approached the shore of a\r\nnew world. A new world, indeed, in far more than the geographical sense;\r\na new life, or at least a new attempt to live; old things passed away,\r\nand all things to be new--except himself. A great wave of homelessness\r\nin the wide world, and perhaps of sickness for the old home, sweeps over\r\nthe poor exile's heart. All is so strange, and so sternly independent of\r\ntheir forlorn and insignificant selves. Perhaps they are being unladen\r\nfrom the ship, shunted down the gang-plank along with their chests,\r\npacked on a transfer-boat like so many imported cattle, only not with\r\nthe care or tenderness with which a drove of Holsteins or Jerseys would\r\nbe handled. A squad of emigrants, just landed on the wharf and waiting\r\nto be transferred to the emigrant-train for another week's voyage by\r\nland to the ends of the continent, is one of the most pathetic sights in\r\nthis world, especially if they are foreign to our speech and dress and\r\nmodes of life. How wistful and helpless and strayed they look!--a bit of\r\nstill and stranded life in the sweep and roar of a world that must seem\r\nto them as wild and as soulless as the ocean they have just left. How\r\nunconsciously they group themselves in picturesque attitudes, which no\r\nartistic eye could improve upon! Their staves, their dangling bundles of\r\ncoarse canvas or of tied-up handkerchiefs of various colors, their\r\nquaint and often grotesque attire, their silent posture and vigilant\r\neyes, their sheep-like dependence on their guides, combined with a\r\nwatch-dog solicitude for their miserable traps, their household\r\ngroupings and varied ages, from the baby born on shipboard to the old\r\ngrandfather come to lay his rheumatic bones in the soil of a strange\r\nland,--I have stood and watched it all many and many a time, ere I\r\nhurried on to my day's business or to my happy home; and the work has\r\nseemed more significant, and the home more sweet, for that sight. Surely\r\none need cut only a little way into life here in order to touch its\r\nprofoundest mysteries and its most far-reaching suggestions.\r\n\r\nOne who has known New York for a generation or two cannot fail to be\r\nstruck with its changed appearance as seen from the ferry-boat. It used\r\nto lie as low and flat as a whale's back, with perhaps a harpoon\r\nsticking out here and there,--to wit, a steeple. The steam elevator has\r\nproved quite an Aladdin's Lamp in its magical feats of architecture, by\r\ndeveloping a vertical in place of a lateral growth of buildings. The\r\nbest building-lots are now in the air, and to be had without\r\nground-rent. Troy had to raise its successive Iliums, Ilioses, and\r\nTrojas, at intervals of ages, and tear or burn each one down before\r\nerecting the next. But we propose to save the Schliemanns of the future\r\na world of trouble by building our various New Yorks simultaneously, one\r\non top of the other. Accordingly, the city is becoming crowded with\r\ntowering and clumsy structures, especially on the elevated ridge which\r\nruns along Broadway from the City Hall to the Battery, giving it the\r\nappearance of an uncouth acropolis. All over the town manufactories and\r\npublic buildings of colossal size stand, like megatheria, knee-deep in a\r\njungle of houses. The campaniles of modern industry rise slim and tall\r\ninto the air. The great buttresses and towers of the Brooklyn Bridge\r\nloom above the house-tops. Grain-elevators, which \"take the wind out of\r\nthe sails\" of Noah's Ark, lie stranded on the docks. The poetic and\r\npicturesque \"forest of masts\" has fallen before the march of progress\r\nand the axe of steam almost as thoroughly as the primeval woods. The low\r\nand open piers have been enclosed, some of them with considerable\r\narchitectural effect, giving a trim and bandbox look to the river-side.\r\n\r\nThe transformation is even more marked on the adjacent shores. As I\r\nremember Jersey City and Hoboken in my boyhood, they were only small\r\nclusters of buildings, with a ferry-house at the water's edge. Now they\r\nhave crept along from the Palisades to the Kill van Kull, overflowed the\r\nBergen Hills, reared giant structures which rival New York's in\r\nmonstrosity, and extended their railroad-wharves and steamship-piers\r\nover the Arcadian haunts of the Elysian Fields and the primitive meadows\r\nof Communipaw and Paulus Hook. And on the East River Brooklyn, joined to\r\nNew York by its Siamese ligament of the Bridge, seems the bigger twin of\r\nthe two. The contrast at night is still more striking. The river and the\r\ntown are brilliant with electric lights, where formerly twinkling lamps\r\nor gas-lights made darkness visible. These have the effect of stars of\r\nthe first magnitude; and the great Bridge, seen on a dark night from\r\nthe South Ferry, with its lights at regular intervals, suggests that\r\nOrion must have slipped his belt.\r\n\r\nCrossing the ferry by night was always a favorite experience with me. In\r\nsultry weather one can nearly always get a whiff of freshened air,\r\nperhaps from the sea; and the quiet is not less reviving to the heated\r\nbrain. Nowhere does the night seem more \"stilly,\" or the sense of\r\nseclusion more profound, than in the middle of the broad bay on a\r\nmidsummer night before or after the theatre-goers have crossed. The\r\ncities, veiled in moonlight or dim in the star-light, seem to be\r\nbreathing peacefully in giant slumber. The prosaic features of the scene\r\nare hidden, the ragged outlines softened, and the smoke and din\r\nindistinguishable. It seems hardly possible that these dream-like\r\nmasses, with their sparkling lights, like reversed heavens, are the\r\nrude, restless, discordant gehennas which they sometimes seem to us by\r\nday. And yet I realize the awfulness and vastness of these great living\r\ncreatures far more than in the belittling and disillusionizing daylight.\r\nThe anchored or passing vessels only add to the sense of seclusion,--the\r\nformer with a solitary lantern at the stern, the latter perhaps a galaxy\r\nof many-colored lights. On a dark night it has the effect of a discharge\r\nof Roman candles arrested in mid-career. The other ferry-boats have a\r\ncomical appearance as they whirl and whiz past us. If in the daytime\r\nthey are deplorably like pumpkins with a stick thrust through them, at\r\nnight they remind us of grotesque lanterns made out of those same\r\npumpkins with illuminated slits and slashes.\r\n\r\nI find no small entertainment and suggestion in watching the\r\nmanoeuvres of the skilful pilots. A novice might hastily conclude that\r\nit was a simple matter to steer a boat from one side of the river to\r\nanother. But let him try, and see where he will bring up. The process is\r\nas nice a one and as scientific as a game of billiards. The exact stage\r\nof the tide and volume of the current, the velocity and direction of the\r\nwind, the ice on the river, the approaching or anchored vessels, and\r\nall of them in their mutual relations, have to be calculated with\r\nmathematical precision, especially in entering the narrow slip: so that\r\nthe directest way is often the longest way around. Is there not here an\r\nobject-lesson for those who would live wisely in this narrow transit\r\nwhich we call life? Keep your eye upon the one point to which you know\r\nthe higher powers call you; but do not think that you are going to march\r\nstraight there by force of will, or straight there at all. You are in a\r\nworld full of cross-purposes and counter-currents and side-winds, of\r\naccumulated conservatisms and masses of mere inertia and oppositions\r\nwhich straddle or shoulder themselves across your path. You will\r\nprobably wreck your undertakings, and will certainly waste your strength\r\nin needless collisions and shovings aside, unless you take all these\r\nthings into account. The capacity to do this is wisdom, as distinct from\r\nknowledge or right intentions, in any sphere of life. Herein is\r\npractical statesmanship, effective reform, everything which has to do\r\nwith human wills and the course of this world.\r\n\r\nBut it is not always practicable, even to the most stalwart and seasoned\r\npassenger, to spend his time on the open deck. To stand out on the front\r\n(one can hardly call it a prow, where the periphery is that of an\r\naverage wash-tub) or at the stern is to be drowned by rain or sawn\r\nasunder by icy winds or broiled like an oyster, and to cower under the\r\nupper deck is to get a lively sense of the Cave of the Winds. One with a\r\nhealthy sense of smell and an instinct for oxygen may well shrink from\r\nentering the cabin, and prefer the perils and discomforts of too much\r\natmosphere to those of a depleted and poisoned one. David may have been\r\nwise in choosing to be punished for his sins by pestilence rather than\r\nby famine or the sword, but he put it on very doubtful ground when he\r\nthought he was thereby falling into \"the hand of the Lord\" in some\r\nspecial manner. For I am confident that bad air is the devil, and that\r\nit is this \"power of the air\" of which he is \"prince.\" And he has no\r\nmore impregnable stronghold than the cabin of a ferry-boat in winter. In\r\nthe cars one can brave public opinion and elude the brakeman's eye so as\r\nto open something in his \"Black Hole.\" But the cabin windows are\r\nhermetically sealed and the doors jealously guarded by an unsleeping\r\ndragon. On some of these boats they have an ingenious method of\r\nintensifying the sickening odor by anointing the floors with a rancid\r\noil, which affords the tender stomach all the advantages of the famous\r\ncrossing of the English Channel.\r\n\r\nThe entire code of the cabin is still to be rescued from the\r\ncivilization of the cave-dwellers. The essence of politeness has been\r\nshown to be self-sacrifice in small things. The average American is\r\nnaturally as unselfish a being as dwells upon the planet, but he often\r\nappears to disadvantage beside far meaner races by reason of an insane\r\nhaste which tramples politeness under its feet. \"After you, sir,\"--a\r\nphrase which contains in a nutshell the very kernel of all\r\ncourtesy,--puts the thing in a shape which is almost a physical\r\nimpossibility to the American temperament. Our fellow-citizen will go\r\nahead of you with the utmost gallantry, though it be to storm a Malakoff\r\nor grapple with a mad dog; but to stand aside and let you get on or off\r\na ferry-boat before him is a strain upon his manners enough to dislocate\r\ntheir every limb. Well, remembering that the passive mood comes after\r\nthe active in grammatical sequence, we will not despair of a development\r\nof the passive virtues even in the \"go-ahead\" American. And then the law\r\nof the cabin will no longer be mob-law, nor its motto, \"Every man for\r\nhimself, and ---- take the ladies.\"\r\n\r\nIt is really ridiculous to see the uneasiness and prematureness of most\r\npersons as the boat begins to approach the shore. Though conscious that\r\nit will not bring the boat and the dock any nearer together, there is a\r\nhunger of the eye to seize the latter from afar. Sometimes the movement\r\nof an asphyxiated passenger for the door, or the momentary stoppage of\r\nthe boat in mid-stream, will bring half the cabin to its feet. It is the\r\nsame impulse which leads passengers, when waiting in the ferry-house, to\r\nglue their faces to the gate for five minutes before the boat arrives,\r\nwhich throngs the platforms and aisles of a car long before the depot is\r\nentered, which in church varies the closing hymn with an overcoat drill\r\nand causes the benediction to be pronounced amid a rattling discharge of\r\nhymn-books into the book-racks.\r\n\r\nHaving entered the cabin, it is always an interesting question on which\r\nside we shall sit,--not to say at which end of the boat. I think that\r\ntemperament has much to do with the decision of these questions. And it\r\nmight be well for some psychologist and sociologist to investigate why\r\nit is that certain persons will instinctively select the rear of the\r\ncabin and others advance to the front; also why some will invariably\r\ntake their seats on the outer and others on the inner side of the cabin.\r\nThis being with myself not a matter of instinct but of reason, perhaps\r\nmy experience is of little value, but I freely and confidentially offer\r\nit in the interests of science. I choose the inner row of seats for the\r\nfollowing reasons: first, they are warmer in winter by reason of the\r\nsteam-pipes which run underneath them, and cooler in summer by being\r\nmore directly in the draught from the open doors; secondly, because the\r\nboat is steadier there, and one can read one's paper, if so inclined,\r\nwith less painful adjustment of the eyes to the shaking type; but\r\nchiefly because in that position one has before one the panorama of the\r\nriver, which is the next best thing to being out on deck. One of the\r\nmysteries of human nature is that so large a proportion of\r\nferry-passengers appear to take no more notice of the glorious scenes\r\nthrough which they pass twice a day than if it were a tunnel. They will\r\nhurry into the cabin in all weathers, seat themselves with their backs\r\nto the river, and spend the voyage buried in the newspaper or gazing\r\ninto vacancy. They do not seem even to appreciate the study of life\r\nafforded by their fellow-passengers. I am sure Dickens would have\r\nrevelled in the opportunity and found no end of Quilps and Chadbands,\r\nSwivellers and Turveydrops, Little Nells and Mrs. Nicklebys, Pickwicks\r\nand Artful Dodgers. I have found splendid models for almost every type\r\nof civilization and not a few types of barbarism. And the eccentricities\r\nof dress are hardly less noteworthy.\r\n\r\nOne learns to enter heartily into the joys and sorrows of the groups,\r\nand even of the individuals, whom he thus watches perhaps from day to\r\nday. He comes to be a mind-reader, and works out many a little\r\nlife-story, as did the ingenious Silas Wegg concerning the people who\r\npassed his corner or lived in the houses of the neighborhood. Among the\r\nmore familiar types are college-students cramming for the day's\r\nrecitation, giggling school-girls, dapper clerks, pert messenger-boys\r\nimproving the time by reading a blood-and-thunder story-paper in the\r\nvery smallest of type, business-men, all nerve in the morning, and in\r\nthe afternoon chatting affably or half asleep, ladies keen for a\r\nshopping-\"meet\" on Fourteenth Street, housewives with market-baskets,\r\nand workingmen with tin pails. Each hour of the day develops its own\r\ntide and type of travel, beginning with the lowest class of laborer and\r\nending with the belated reveller. There is a still hour in the morning,\r\nawhile before noon, when the idlers and the dissipated begin to dribble\r\ninto or out of the city, and studies of the odd and the sad alike abound\r\nfor the Hogarthian pencil and imagination.\r\n\r\nThe \"basket brigade\" constitutes a large and regular detachment of the\r\ntrans-Hudson army. Pleasant it is (I can hear the parody-fiend murmur),\r\nwhen things are green and price of meat is low, to move amid the\r\nmarket-scene, where gourmands stout and housewives lean with baskets\r\ncome and go. Tempting too, alike to the dainty and the thrifty. Like\r\nRobinet in the \"Evenings at Home,\" it adds much to the relish of one's\r\nlittle supper to have selected it one's self out of a whole marketful\r\nand to inhale its imaginary savors all the way home. Then, it is so\r\nnice to surprise the wife with the earliest of the season, or to pour\r\nout upon the table a dozen golden oranges, or to bring a little light\r\ninto the invalid's eye by a basket of grapes or a fragrant bunch of\r\nflowers, or to delight Tiny Tim with a trinket, or to let little Jacob\r\n\"know what oysters is.\" Especially on Saturday afternoons does the\r\nbasket brigade come out in force, and many a homely little idyl may be\r\nconjured out of the family groups or the purveying parents who throng\r\nand cumber the boat at such times. The capacities of the market-basket,\r\nas then and there revealed, are prodigious, rivalling those of the trunk\r\nof travel; and yet out of the cover will still protrude the legs of\r\nunadjustable \"broilers\" and the green fringes of garden-stuff, and all\r\nthis not counting in the oyster-pail, or the great watermelon which has\r\nto be carried separately by its wooden handle. The epicurean prospect of\r\nthe Sunday dinner reflected in the restful face as well as materialized\r\nin the basket can hardly fail to elicit a gentle thought from the\r\nsternest Sabbatarian's heart.\r\n\r\nWith the excursion-season comes another phase of our little idyllic\r\nstudies, as we watch the groups and couples intent upon a picnic at the\r\nsea-side or among the Jersey villages. Here is a representative family\r\nparty which I followed with my eyes, and still farther with my\r\nimagination, on their way to Coney Island on a fine, fresh summer\r\nmorning. There was the grandma, a bright-eyed, beaming old lady,\r\nbeginning to bend somewhat with years, but as pleased with the day's\r\nouting as any of them. There was the mother, sharing her responsibility\r\nwith the neat and pretty young-lady daughter. There was a youth,\r\nsomewhat of the Abel Garland type, who might have been the young lady's\r\nbrother, but who was a happy man even if he was not. There was a small\r\nboy; and who need be told what a day that was for him? Lastly, there\r\nwere two charming little ringleted girls, who walked hand in hand in the\r\nprettiest way, with eyes that fairly danced and feet that could hardly\r\nhelp doing so. There was no baby to utter a discordant note or to hang\r\nas a Damocles' sword of apprehension over the heads of the group. But in\r\nso affectionate and well-regulated a family I am not sure that its\r\npresence would not have constituted a new source of happiness. And by\r\nand by, as the afternoon waned, I could imagine the father meeting them\r\nat the beach, with perhaps the real brother (or would it be the real\r\nnot-brother?), and coming home with them in the cool evening and the\r\nsweet moonlight.\r\n\r\nOn Saturdays there is an earlier current of home-going working-people;\r\nand it is easy to detect a quite different air about them from what they\r\nwear on other days. There is no shadow of next morning impending over\r\nthem. One realizes anew the Sabbath as made for man,--the man who\r\nworks,--and blesses the Son of Man who is \"Lord also of the Sabbath.\"\r\nThis is the evening when they carry home their reading for the week, as\r\nwell as their Sunday dinner. I wish more could be said for the general\r\nquality, intellectual or moral, of this literature. But most of it is\r\nbetter than mental vacancy, and a great advance on the illiteracy in\r\nwhich these classes were sunk not so very long ago. And it must be borne\r\nin mind that the transient and sensational reading which so many of us\r\ncarry in cars and cabins, or buy at news-stands, or take out of\r\nlibraries, would misrepresent us if supposed to be all we had or loved\r\nto read. There is in more of these homes than perhaps we suspect a shelf\r\nwith its well-thumbed \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" its \"Robinson Crusoe\" with\r\none cover gone, its odd volume of Waverley or Dickens, its copy of Burns\r\nor Longfellow, its row of school histories and science, and its pile of\r\nmagazines.\r\n\r\nAt certain hours, when the trains are due, the basket brigade is\r\nreinforced by the carpet-bag battalion; and a crowd of home-coming or\r\nout-going travellers is a never-ending source of sympathetic and\r\nimaginative study to the leisurely looker-on. What an anachronism that\r\nword \"carpet-bag\" has become, by the way! I saw not long ago on the\r\nferry-boat a genuine and literal specimen, which carried back my\r\nthoughts for a generation to the day when bags were really made of\r\ncarpet and the most fastidious social Bourbon did not disdain to carry\r\nthem. They flourished in the age of shawls, and came in not long after\r\nthe epoch of \"gum\" shoes. They were of every conceivable pattern, from\r\nthe sober symphony in brown to a gorgeous wealth of color that might vie\r\nwith the most audacious wall-paper of an aesthetic age. This \"belated\r\ntraveller\" of a carpet-bag had all the appearance of a faded and\r\nbedraggled gentility,--was, in fact, a veritable tramp among luggage. It\r\nsagged down as it stood on the floor. It ran here and there into\r\nstrings, as of shoes untied and coat fastened together by twine in lieu\r\nof buttons. And it was trampy with mouldy discoloration and\r\ntravel-stains. It was of vast dimensions, and, as was always the way\r\nwith carpet-bags, bulging in all directions with its contents. I was not\r\nsurprised to discover, through its orifice, that it had long ceased to\r\nbe a receptacle for clothing and was filled with honest workman's tools.\r\nBurglars, the police-reports tell us, affect the carpet-bag for their\r\njimmies and the like, but in such case it may be depended on to be as\r\nreputable in appearance and as close-mouthed as the last defaulting\r\ntreasurer or trustee. The modern luggage is a type of advanced thought,\r\nif not civilization, whether we consider the Saratoga trunk, the\r\nRussia-leather satchel, the school-boy's knapsack, or the commercial\r\ntraveller's double-locked valise. There is \"nothing like leather:\" men\r\nlive now in their trunks, and America's proudest contribution to the\r\nworld is the railway-check.\r\n\r\nBut my boat bumps on the shore, and I must pass out, to the marching\r\nmusic of the rattling chains and the swashing tide, to my\r\nbusiness,--perhaps a \"better\" one to be \"about\" than writing these idle\r\nobservations on a North-River Ferry.\r\n\r\nF. N. ZABRISKIE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF READING.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistics as to the number of men and women of good standing in the\r\nworld who cannot read might have a certain interest. There are probably\r\nmore persons laboring under that disability than is usually supposed,\r\nand this with no reference to unfortunates who in early life have missed\r\nthe opportunity of learning their A B C, but thinking only of those who\r\nhave never found the way to utilize a knowledge of letters,--of persons,\r\nin short, who do not know what to do with a book. Trustworthy\r\nstatistics, however, would not be easily obtained: there is too strong a\r\nprejudice in favor of books for any one to be very forward in confessing\r\na distaste for them. Now and then such an admission is made, but, for\r\nthe most part, people like to think that under auspicious conditions--if\r\nthey had time, or quiet, or health, or what not--they should be great\r\nreaders. It is a point on which it is quite possible to deceive one's\r\nself and almost impossible to deceive others.\r\n\r\nYou are acquainted, perhaps, with some lady on whose table lies the book\r\nthat every one is talking about: it is not a novel, we will suppose.\r\n\"Ah, you have that!\" you say to her. Yes, and she expects to enjoy it\r\n_immensely_. She lifts the cover and casts a caressing glance upon its\r\npages, for all the world as if she could not wait to be at it. You know\r\nthe feeling, and sympathize with her. The next time you are there,\r\nseeing the book again reminds you to ask how she liked it. \"Why,\r\npositively,\" she says, \"I haven't had _a single minute_ in which I could\r\ntake it up!\" But she still cherishes the same agreeable anticipations as\r\nbefore with regard to it. After a considerable lapse of time, on the\r\noccasion of another call you may notice a mark protruding in the region\r\nof the first chapter, and if mischief or malice or any other inborn\r\npropensity to evil prompts you to allude to the subject once more and\r\ninquire if the book pleases her, on the whole, she will probably say\r\nthat it does _as far as she has read_, only there is an unconscious\r\nplaintiveness about this statement which betrays that enthusiasm has\r\nwaned: the fact is, everybody is talking of another book now, and she\r\nhas the uncomfortable feeling of being behind-hand. But all the same she\r\nmay be just as intimately persuaded that it is only a concatenation of\r\nadverse circumstances which has prevented her finishing the book long\r\nago, as you are that she will never finish it.\r\n\r\nHowever, as already said, there may sometimes be found among non-readers\r\na clear apprehension of the state of their case. Thus, a lady once\r\navowed, when a conversation had turned upon the profit and pleasure of\r\nreading, that she had not the least liking for books and never had had.\r\nShe regretted it extremely; she felt when she saw any one absorbed in\r\nreading that she had missed something; there were times when if she\r\ncould forget herself in a book she should be very glad, but she could\r\nnot; she had never been taught to care for reading when she was a child,\r\nand it was too late to learn now. Still, on being persuaded to think\r\nthat she might at least try, she expressed an ambition to enjoy\r\nThackeray, and asked to have his best novel recommended. \"Vanity Fair\"\r\nwas accordingly suggested as most likely to please her, and, it being\r\nprocured, she announced on the following evening that she had read\r\n_thirty pages_ that day, and meant to continue at the same rate. Her\r\nadmiration, alas! was plainly more for her own achievement than for that\r\nof her author; nevertheless, the literary adviser talked encouragingly,\r\nas the medical adviser often must, in spite of bad signs, and for a few\r\nnights the number of pages kept pretty well up to the mark, then\r\nsteadily declined, and, after an hiatus or two, \"Vanity Fair\" was\r\nmentioned no more. It was, as the lady herself had thought, too late.\r\nBut on another point also she may have been right,--namely, in the\r\nimplied belief that childhood was the time when she might have learned\r\nto like reading.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly a wide-spread impression that children ought to\r\ndisplay some taste for literature, so that to say a child does not care\r\nfor his book is rather a damaging statement: it is made with reluctance:\r\none is \"_afraid_ Charlie does not like to read;\" one always adds, if\r\npossible, that \"he likes to be read to, however,\" and in any case the\r\nobliging by-stander hastens to say, \"Oh, well, perhaps he will take to\r\nreading as he grows older,\" which remark, on the principle that one\r\nnever knows what may happen, is incontrovertible as far as it goes. No\r\none would wish to assert dogmatically that Charlie will not ripen into a\r\nreader, but at the same time no one very seriously supposes that he\r\nwill. \"As the twig is bent the tree's inclined\" is felt to be peculiarly\r\napplicable in his case.\r\n\r\nAnd still one ought not to be fatalistic about the twig: for the tree,\r\nindeed, it is too late, but that means nothing, if not that for the twig\r\nit is yet time. In certain ways this idea is recognized and acted upon,\r\nas, for instance, when a taste for music is to be cultivated children\r\nare held to practise daily on the piano, even though they hate it; if\r\ndancing is necessary to secure a graceful carriage, they must learn to\r\ndance, notwithstanding that they might prefer to swarm up and down the\r\nsidewalk on roller-skates. And so, when a relish for books is to be\r\nawakened, why should it not follow that children must read? Why content\r\none's self with anything short of that? To read to a child, otherwise\r\nthan occasionally and with the occult purpose of giving a lesson in ease\r\nof utterance, is evidently pernicious. It may sound well to say that\r\nCharlie likes to be read to, but the real sense of the statement is that\r\nhe considers reading laborious, and that we are doing our best to\r\nstrengthen him in that opinion. To be sure he is right,--reading _is_\r\nmore or less laborious at the outset; but then the obvious deduction\r\nfrom this would seem to be that the more seriously he applies himself to\r\nit the better.\r\n\r\nTo some persons such an axiom will have a brain-feverish sound: children\r\nare heard of who are devoted to books to the injury of their health, and\r\nso it is assumed that to incite any child to read may be a tempting of\r\nProvidence. This is a groundless supposition. Even in the few authentic\r\ncases of precocious development efficient parents may easily take\r\nmeasures to check the ravages of intellect, while in the far greater\r\nnumber of instances where the mental and physical qualities are pretty\r\nevenly balanced, parental efficiency would be well displayed in\r\ncherishing rather than in repressing a love for literature. If one\r\nthinks what a companion a book may be in hours of loneliness, what a\r\ncomforter in weary illness or in sorrow, and, above all, what a blessing\r\nin the temporary escape it offers from the every-day trials of\r\nexistence, which tend to take on huge proportions if one settles down\r\namong them, but will look of a very reasonable size to one who comes\r\nback to them with sight refreshed after a judicious absence,--if one\r\nthinks of all this, the art of playing on the piano or of dancing sinks\r\ngreatly in importance as compared with the art of reading. Even\r\nconsidering only the respective duration of advantage, one would have to\r\ndecide for reading if a choice must be made, for girls generally give up\r\nmusic when they marry, and at some not quite so definitely fixed period\r\ndancing is renounced by both sexes, while books remain appropriate to\r\nevery age and condition of life.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, there is no need to choose: reading may be cultivated\r\nside by side with more florid accomplishments. To provide an interesting\r\nbook and appoint an hour for its perusal may just as easily be done as\r\nto set apart an hour for the piano,--indeed, in some cases more easily,\r\nsince there would be no bills coming in for the reading-lessons. And who\r\nwill say that a child might not learn to like reading, might not\r\ninsensibly get into the spirit of the art, by this simple method when\r\nduly insisted on? Perhaps it would fail sometimes; there may be persons\r\nabsolutely incapable of the prolonged attention required for reading;\r\nbut one cannot help thinking that in most minds this power of attention\r\ncould be aroused and fostered, and that, therefore, if a child does not\r\nlike books at the start, that need not be accounted a fatal sign. People\r\nwho have detested their music-lessons at first have been known to come\r\nfinally to the enjoyment of music through those very means.\r\n\r\nWhen children should begin to read, and how they should learn, are\r\nquestions which lie rather outside the scope of this paper and concern\r\nthose who \"take to reading\" as well as those who \"like to be read to;\"\r\nbut, stating the case broadly, one might say that they can begin at any\r\ntime and learn anyhow. It has been seriously advocated that children be\r\nnot taught to read until they are ten years old; and certainly it would\r\nbe quite possible to prevent their reading before then. On the other\r\nhand, as an actual fact, they do read at seven and eight years of age,\r\nand used to read at five or even earlier. Regarded by the light of\r\nmodern theory, what they used to do was, of course, deplorable; still,\r\nthe fact remains, and is mitigated by circumstances, for the children\r\nwere not considered prodigies at that time, and a due proportion of them\r\nlived to grow up, and may be seen to-day, as men and women, walking\r\nabout the world in tolerable health and spirits.\r\n\r\nWith respect to methods of learning to read, the difference must appear\r\neven greater to one who has ever seen or who dimly remembers an\r\nold-fashioned _primer_. There was the alphabet to begin with, then some\r\nsyllables and little words neatly arranged in columns, and directly upon\r\nthat the reading-lesson, introduced, it may be, by the picture of a\r\nchild in long pantalettes contemplating a shrub which, figuratively\r\nspeaking, lent color to a few conventional remarks upon the rose,--as\r\nthat it is red and smells sweet. Such was the whole system. We are\r\naware now that to storm the citadel of letters in that fashion was\r\nabsurd; that, on the contrary, it should be scientifically approached in\r\nthe taking of outworks; and nevertheless here also is the fact to be\r\nreckoned with that children did learn by the old system, and that they\r\nlearned with what looks in these days like marvellous celerity is a\r\nmitigating circumstance which has even yet a certain charm for some\r\nminds. There was a precision, too, about acquirements under the ancient\r\nmethod which is not always found under the new. At present the very\r\nmother of a child of eight years may not be quite clear as to her\r\ndaughter's attainments; she _can_ read, but still, \"you know, they teach\r\nthem now to write first,\" and it appears eventually that Nellie writes\r\nso well and reads so ill as to be obliged to copy off her lessons for\r\nthe advantage of learning them from her own handwriting.\r\n\r\nBut all this is simply in support of the proposition that children can\r\nlearn to read anyhow, and, assuming thus much to be demonstrated, we may\r\npass to something else. _What_ is a weightier consideration in the\r\nmatter of reading than either _how_ or _when_. As a question, it would\r\nbe differently answered in different ages of the world. We know that Dr.\r\nJohnson once took a little girl on his knee and put her directly down\r\nagain because she had not read \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" The great\r\nlexicographer might take up and put down a good many children nowadays\r\nbefore he found the right one; and we need not think the worse of them\r\non that account. We feel that even a child who had the advantage of Dr.\r\nJohnson's acquaintance ought not to be required to comprehend the\r\nImmortal Allegory. It is true he may have expected her to enjoy it\r\nwithout comprehending it, and that gives the case a different aspect.\r\nConsidering how few books the little maid had of her own, and especially\r\nif it was an illustrated edition of Bunyan's works which, lying on the\r\ntable, prompted the good doctor's question, one is half inclined to\r\nagree with him that the demons in the Valley of the Shadow of Death and\r\nthe angelic forms which meet the Pilgrim as Two Men of the Land of\r\nBeulah ought to have enticed her imagination into reading, whether she\r\nunderstood or not.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, at all events, that comprehension is not necessary to the\r\nappreciation of masterpieces. In an age less remote than Dr. Johnson's,\r\nalthough still antediluvian with respect to the now prevailing flood of\r\njuvenile literature, children often read and liked what they did not\r\nunderstand. There were fairy-tales, to be sure, even then, and tales\r\npopular and moral, also a few such books as \"Amy Herbert\" and \"Laneton\r\nParsonage,\" but children who were fond of reading soon had those by\r\nheart, and would then browse, perchance, in their elders' pastures, by\r\nwhich means it happened that one child used to derive no little\r\nsatisfaction from the \"True Account of the Apparition of Mrs. Veal to\r\nMrs. Barlow.\" Told as it is with Defoe's inimitable circumstantiality,\r\nshe was so far from understanding it as to rather more than half believe\r\nit. She knew well that ghosts at night-time, robed in white, were\r\nfabulous and never to be thought of, especially when one was alone in\r\nthe dark; but a ghost that paid visits in broad daylight, dressed in\r\nbonnet and shawl like anybody else, and whose proceedings were gravely\r\nchronicled for grown persons and labelled _true_,--what were you to\r\nthink of that? It may be remembered that when Mrs. Barlow asks Mrs. Veal\r\nany question the answering of which would seem to be inconsistent with\r\nher ghostly state, Defoe says, \"However, she waived that;\" and, _waive_\r\nnot being at that time in the vocabulary of the young reader, she always\r\nimagined Mrs. Veal putting the question away from her, as it were, with\r\na motion of her hand, and gazing the while in stony silence at Mrs.\r\nBarlow. This dramatic situation was calculated to have a certain effect\r\nupon the nerves, and in fact it was then that the profound silence of\r\nthe room, accentuated by the ticking of the clock, used to seem fraught\r\nwith the possibility of a ghost abroad with her visiting-list, who\r\nmight presently be _waiving_ such courtesies as even an unwilling\r\nhostess would feel constrained to offer.\r\n\r\nRather unhealthy reading, one would say, but yet not so bad as it\r\nsounds; for the book was no sooner shut than the whole impression\r\ndissolved, though it might be renewed at will, as it often was. It was\r\nin the same family that all the children at an early age took possession\r\nof \"Oliver Twist\" as a juvenile book. They wept over little Dick's\r\nfarewell to Oliver, and shuddered when Nancy saw coffins, enjoying it\r\nall extremely, and taking in so little of it that it has appeared to\r\nthem since as not one of the least of Dickens's glories that he could\r\nwrite a book about the scum of London which children may read and\r\nre-read well into their young girlhood without receiving even the shadow\r\nof an impression of any evil beyond pocket-picking and house-breaking\r\nand general hard-heartedness.\r\n\r\nAnd so it might not be far from the truth to say that children can read\r\nanything. They can, and do, even now when they have a literature of\r\ntheir own; for persons who would be shocked at the idea of turning a\r\nchild loose in an adult library, where things unsuitable might pass\r\nharmlessly over its head, think nothing of taking a book off a counter\r\nand presenting it to their little ones, they themselves knowing no more\r\nthan the man in the moon what it contains, although certain that the\r\ncontents, whatever they may be, will be readily assimilated by the\r\nyouthful mind. Suppose simply that such a book is full of slang and bad\r\ngrammar, the antediluvians had an advantage there: if you want that sort\r\nof thing to amuse children with, the language of thieves is peculiarly\r\nsuitable, in so far that if ever the young people who devoured \"Oliver\r\nTwist\" had over among themselves any of the Dodger's and Charley Bates's\r\nracy expressions it was with a wholesome sense of its being highly\r\nimproper; whereas one cannot imagine the little folk of to-day seeing\r\nany impropriety in an equally debased decoction of English--albeit\r\nsomewhat more mildly drawn--when put into the mouths of children like\r\nthemselves. Then, again, the ancient young people used to read Scott's\r\nand Cooper's novels, and found there much that was entirely beyond them,\r\nwhich they knew was only for grown persons, and therefore, though they\r\nread of love, courtship, and marriage, they remained as unsophisticated\r\nas before. But how is a child to be unsophisticated nowadays, when all\r\nthese topics are manipulated for its especial benefit?--when there is a\r\ndevoted boy in the story, and, in due course of time, proposal,\r\nengagement, and the wedding? In the same way one can affirm without fear\r\nof contradiction that the lads who formerly enjoyed pirates and Red\r\nRovers from their parents' book-shelves had a healthier mental food than\r\nthose who at present are provided with Rovers of their own, carefully\r\nadapted to their mental capacity, in the shape of small boys who meet\r\nthe world single-handed and make their way to fame and fortune. Then,\r\nfinally, were not the kings and courtiers, the Crusaders and Saracens,\r\nthe Indians and pioneers of former days better training for the\r\nimagination than descriptions of picnics, skating-parties, and\r\nchildren's balls, enlivened with such small squabbles or adventures as\r\nare incident thereto? Realism has invaded even the children's\r\ndepartment, and to that extent that there seems to be nothing left for\r\nfancy but to go off on a tangent in frantic imitation of Jules Verne or\r\nfeeble copies of \"Alice in Wonderland.\"\r\n\r\nOf course this is not to deny that there are gems in children's\r\nliterature which they may be thankful to possess and we may be glad to\r\nshare with them: indeed, the foregoing observations should be taken\r\nsimply to the effect that there is room for a choice among juvenile\r\nbooks, and very little choosing. We started out with the happy idea that\r\nreading-lessons cost nothing, and are come round to the conviction that\r\nit is a pity they are not expensive, that there is not some one who, for\r\na consideration, would take the children in hand,--not only those who\r\nare expected to read by and by, but also the born readers,--and, through\r\na judicious selection of what is within their range, gradually educate\r\nthem up to a correct literary taste. For there is something sadder even\r\nthan being totally unable to read, and that is reading a great deal and\r\nnever anything worth while. What is worth while includes, naturally,\r\nmuch besides novels; but, then, a person who appreciates a good novel\r\nusually reads other good things; and, at all events, children must begin\r\nwith fiction, and, even were they to end there, that this should be\r\nexcellent of its kind is a step in the right direction. It would not be\r\na bad aim to have in view that they should come by degrees to a just\r\nappreciation of Thackeray and his compeers. And where parents are\r\nunwilling--or, by reason of being themselves no readers, unable--to plan\r\na course of reading to that effect, why, in all seriousness, should they\r\nnot place the matter in the hands of some sound-minded family\r\ncounsellor, who would thenceforward look after the children's literary\r\ntaste, as the dentist looks after their teeth?\r\n\r\nThat would put an end to the singular anomaly by which parents, who\r\ndoubtless mean to guard their sons and daughters from evil society as\r\nthey would from the plague, know, as a matter of fact, nothing at all of\r\ntheir inmost companions. When the novel-devouring period is reached,\r\nthis is especially remarkable: a mother may then look at her young\r\ndaughter sitting apart, silent, entranced, drinking in what she takes\r\nfor the true philosophy of life from some romance of modern society\r\nwhich has been recommended to her as \"splendid\" by the girls at school,\r\nand find no more appropriate reflection to make upon this spectacle than\r\nthat \"Mary is never so happy as when she is buried in a book.\" But one\r\nimagines the family counsellor, under similar circumstances, interesting\r\nhimself or herself to discover what sort of a book it is that Mary is\r\nburied in, and, if it should prove to be a tissue of false sentiment,\r\nfalse pathos, and even false morals from beginning to end, directing\r\nher attention to that fact, and giving her as an antidote something\r\nwhich, whether grave or gay, amusing or affecting, should be written in\r\ngood English and in sound taste.\r\n\r\nGRACE H.

HILDRETH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BACKWOODS ROMANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light of the just-risen moon shone upon the black letters of the\r\nguide-post which said that it was one mile to Clear Lake Settlement, and\r\nilluminated as lonely a region as could be found in the whole world. On\r\none side of the snowy road a deep pine wood rose tall and dark against\r\nthe evening sky. On the other were stretches of field and marsh-land,\r\nwhich, even when warm and green with summer, had a desolate aspect, with\r\ntheir background of low, monotonous hills, and both before and behind\r\nwere more lonesome hills, more dreary fields, and black masses of\r\nwoodland. Not one homely roof was visible in the hard, white moonlight,\r\nnor the glimmer of a lamp, nor a waft of chimney-smoke; not even the\r\ntinkle of a sleigh-bell or a foot-step was to be heard. The silence\r\nseemed whispering to the hills. One star glimmered in the orange\r\nafter-glow of sunset.\r\n\r\nIt had been an unusually warm day for late December, and the faint,\r\ndelicate scent of melting snow was still in the air, though it was\r\ngrowing crisp and cold and icicles were forming on the branches of the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nTwo paths which diverged widely as they trailed through the woods came\r\nalmost together as they reached the road, and presently from one of\r\nthese paths emerged the dark figure of a man carrying a lighted lantern.\r\nStepping into the road, he paused for a moment at the opening of the\r\nother path, and, hearing footsteps and a slow, grave voice humming an\r\nold love-song, leaned against the creaking guide-post and waited for the\r\nsinger to approach. He was young, apparently not over twenty-eight or\r\nnine years, was dressed like a lumberman, and was of somewhat broad and\r\nclumsy build. But in his face, which was clearly revealed by the\r\nflickering flame of the lantern, though he stood in deep shadow, there\r\nwas no coarse rusticity. The full but finely-formed features had a most\r\ngentle and amiable cast, resembling those of one of Raphael's cherubs in\r\ntheir halo of yellow hair. A grave smile lingered in his sea-blue eyes.\r\n\r\nAs he listened to the voice, however, a look, half amusement, half\r\nannoyance, crossed his mild countenance, and his smiling eyes became\r\nsteel-colored and flashed with something like anger; but it was only for\r\nan instant.\r\n\r\n\"Halloo! that you out o' the woods, John Barker?\" he called, in a\r\nsmooth, pleasant tone.\r\n\r\n\"'Pears tew be; 'n' yeou, Reube Wetherbee,--it seems yeou're eout er the\r\nwoods, tew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am; but then I don't hev ter travel twelve or fifteen miles\r\nter git ter the settlement. How about the dance to-morrow night? Your\r\ncamp goin' ter turn out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some o' the hands catilate ter go, I b'lieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"But a sober feller like you don't care for such kind er jollifications\r\nmuch, I reckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinkin' o' goin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! 'n' that accounts for your journey to the settlement to-night.\r\nGoin' to the tavern, of course. I say, man, we're bound there on the\r\nsame arrand. What's goin' to be done about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Reube Wetherbee?\" exclaimed Barker, with a deep frown\r\nupon his rugged features, which looked almost grotesque in the delicate\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know what I mean, well enough, John, and you may as well take\r\nit calmly. When two men take a farncy to the same woman there's likely\r\nto be some sarse between 'em; but that's no use. Now, we're both got to\r\nthe same point on our way ter ask Drusy to go ter the dance. Your legs\r\nmay be a little longer'n mine, 'n' if we should try a race you might\r\nreach the tavern a minute before me, 'n' you might not, for I'm pretty\r\nnimble 'n' all-fired long-winded. So I say, let's have things fair 'n'\r\nsquare. I've got a pack of cards in my pocket, 'n' I'm fur goin' into\r\nJones's old camp--it's only a few steps beyond here, in the edge of the\r\nwoods, you know--'n' playin' it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I kin resk it 'n' take my chances as they come,\" said Barker,\r\nin a voice which sounded husky and strange. And he took great strides\r\nalong the crisp white road.\r\n\r\n\"Your chances! Why, you know, man, if I should get there first you\r\nwouldn't have the ghost of a chance, 'n' if we should get there at the\r\nsame time do you s'pose she'd say yes to you 'n' no to me? To speak up\r\nfrank, she don't seem to set great store by neither of us, but she\r\nfavors me full as much as she does any other feller, that's certain. I\r\ndoubt whether she'd go to the dance even with me, though. There's\r\nsomething the matter. Hang it if I don't sometimes think she's got\r\nanother feller down-river where she come from. Still, she's been to\r\nJones's pritty near a year now, 'n' he ain't put in an appearance, 'n'\r\nshe never gets a letter from anybody, Mrs. Jones says.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it to yeou, enyhow?\" blazed Barker. \"Keep yer suspicionin', as\r\nwell as yer blarsted consate, ter yerself. I don't want ter hear yeou\r\ntalk about her. Where's Henrietty Blaisdell? What right hev yeou ter\r\ntake a farncy ter another woman, when yeou've been a-keepin' company\r\nwith her for a year 'n' more? 'N' yeou pryin' raound ter see if Drusy\r\ngits letters--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, John! As I said before, sarse won't set things straight, 'n'\r\nI've just as good a right as you or any other man ter make up to Drusy.\r\nI ain't bound to Henrietta.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rights seem diffrunt to diffrunt folks, I catilate. Enyhow, I hain't\r\na-goin' ter listen ter eny more ov your tongue. I'm a-goin' along, 'n'\r\nyou kin go ahead or foller as it suits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, it seems ter me that we're in a kind ov embarrassin' fix,\r\n'n' the cards would be a consolin' way to git out of it. If--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along, then, but quit chinnin' about Drusy.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the two men turned back into the woods, in whose weird darkness the\r\nlight of Reube's lantern was no more than that of a firefly. The\r\nmoonlight stole into little openings, outlined the trees upon the\r\nglittering sward, and hovered like a ghost on the path before them. The\r\ncamp was a somewhat ruinous affair, but had lately been occupied by a\r\nparty of surveyors. With the blaze of a great fire its interior might\r\nhave been cheerful, but, as it was, it seemed a ghostly, haunted place,\r\nfilled with mysterious sounds and shadows. One feeble moon-ray struggled\r\nthrough the foliage of a tall pine-tree, and, reaching down the wide\r\nsmoke-hole overhead, searched the ashes on the hearthstone with a pallid\r\nfinger. The wind rustled among some dead vines which reached through the\r\nchinks between the logs, and made a creeping sound like footfalls over\r\nthe snow-covered plank floor.\r\n\r\nWetherbee placed his lantern upon the creaking old shelf which served\r\nfor a table, and, seating themselves upon a bench, the two men commenced\r\ntheir game with deep earnestness. Barker's features were white and set;\r\nhis strong arm trembled as he handled the cards, and his breath came\r\nquick and hard.\r\n\r\nIt was as if he were staking his life upon the play, as if his whole\r\nfate were to be decided by it.\r\n\r\n\"Great Jupiter, man! don't look like that,\" said Wetherbee, regarding\r\nhim for the first time as the game proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"I've been feelin' as if 'twas a case of life 'n' death myself, 'n', by\r\nGeorge, it's no wonder, this place is so all-fired uncanny. They used\r\nter say the camp was haunted; 'n' I b'lieve it.\"\r\n\r\nA great gray owl, which had flown from his abiding-place in a hollow\r\ntree near by and perched upon the roof just on the edge of the\r\nsmoke-hole, gave utterance to something which sounded like a mocking\r\npeal of laughter.\r\n\r\nBoth men started violently.\r\n\r\n\"Blarst the owl!\" said Wetherbee angrily, throwing a piece of wood\r\nthrough the hole to frighten it away.\r\n\r\nThen the play proceeded silently until finally Wetherbee, who had been\r\nsteadily winning from the first, made the last deal and threw upon the\r\ntable the lucky cards which decided him to be the victor.\r\n\r\n\"I knowed how 'twould be from the fust,\" said Barker; \"but p'r'aps\r\n'twon't make no great diff'rence, after all.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the men left the camp and walked silently together to the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nJones's Tavern, as it was called, a large white house with a piazza in\r\nfront and a long, low ell, stood in the midst of the primitive little\r\nsettlement, and was a favorite retreat of the lumbermen whenever they\r\nhad the good fortune to get out of the woods, as well as the\r\nstopping-place of the overseers and the men with supply-teams on their\r\nway to and from the camps.\r\n\r\n\"Here's two more fellers for the darnse,\" said the landlord, who was\r\npouring out a glass of spiced cider for a sturdy young backwoodsman who\r\nhad evidently just arrived. \"A darnse is about equil to Fourth o' July,\r\n'n' brings the boys out thicker 'n bees in a berry-pastur'. Haul up ter\r\nthe fire 'n' hev somethin' warmin'. Soft weather fur lumberin', hain't\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nWith a nod and regretful glance at a handsome young woman who was wiping\r\nteacups at the other end of the room, which was extremely long and had a\r\nfireplace at one end and a cooking-stove at the other, Barker accepted\r\nthe invitation. But Wetherbee, after exchanging greetings with the\r\nlandlord and his companion, went over to speak to the young woman, and\r\nremained talking with her in an undertone for some time.\r\n\r\n\"The kitchen eend seems ter be the most 'tractable ter the fellers, in\r\nspite of hot cider,\" remarked the landlord, with a laugh. \"'N' what's\r\nthe mahter with yaou, John? Yaou 'pear ter be kinder daown 't the maouth\r\n'n' absent-minded. Must ha' been pickin' up a gal. Well, a feller that's\r\ncourtin' hain't no stranger tew affliction, thet's a fact. I wuz a\r\nbachelder once myself.\"\r\n\r\nA deep crimson overspread Barker's honest countenance, but he did not\r\nopen his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Git eout, square!\" said the other lumberman, roaring. \"I b'lieve yeou\r\nwas born a-jokin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe handsome young woman disappeared into the pantry. Wetherbee strode\r\ntoward the group by the fireplace with an air of forced unconcern.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-night, folks: I'm off,\" said he. \"I'm a-goin' to help trim\r\nup the hall fur the dance, 'n' have got ter step pretty lively.\" And he\r\nmade signs to Barker to follow him out of doors.\r\n\r\n\"She won't go with me, John,\" he said, as soon as they were alone. \"As I\r\nsaid before, there's something the matter. But I ruther guess I shan't\r\nbe obliged to go without company, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nBarker's face lighted up with a look of relief, and as he watched\r\nWetherbee's retreating figure a little gleam of hope awoke in his\r\nbreast. He stopped out under the stars a few moments for reflection, and\r\nthe hope soon vanished.\r\n\r\n\"No; 'tain't no use,\" he said to himself. \"She likes Reube better'n she\r\ndoes me, 'n' she wouldn't go with him. It stan's ter reason she should\r\nlike him better. He's boss o' the gang, looks as smooth 'n' slick 's a\r\nparson, 'n' he's been a schoolmaster, tew. Then he's got sich kinder\r\nsilky ways 'n' smiles. Not that I b'lieve in 'em much, but the\r\nwimmen-folks do. Still, 'twon't do no harm ter ask her, 'n' I reckon\r\nI'll do it, whuther er no.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the house again, the object of these reflections was\r\nstill in the pantry, mixing bread which was to be set to rise for\r\nbreakfast. She was a tall, rather slender young woman. A heavy mass of\r\njet-black hair crowned her small, well-set head. Her eyes, to quote one\r\nof her backwoods admirers, were \"jest the color o' swamp blue-berries,\r\nand hed the same sort o' shiny mist in them.\" Her skin was dark, almost\r\nswarthy, but a perpetual fire burned on her smooth, oval cheeks,\r\ndeepening and fading according to her moods. She wore the usual\r\nevery-day attire of the women of the region,--mistresses as well as\r\n\"hired girls,\"--a dark-print gown, but, like Ophelia's rue, \"it was worn\r\nwith a difference,\" fitting her lithe, graceful figure to perfection,\r\nand set off by a dainty band of white and knot of ribbon at the throat.\r\n\r\nBarker entered the pantry, and stood watching her at her work with\r\nbashful admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it, John?\" said she, after an interval, looking up with a\r\nsmile which disclosed unexpected dimples about her mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Drusy,\" said he, coloring to the roots of his stiff, reddish hair, \"I\r\ndon't s'pose it's of no use ter ask ye ter go ter the dance 'long o' me,\r\nseein' as you've refused Reube, that is so much likelier lookin' 'n'\r\nappearin' than I be; but I've footed it twelve mild out er the woods ter\r\nask fur yer company, 'n' neow I hain't goin' back without hearin' yeour\r\nsay abeout it, et least. I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, John; 'tain't the least use,\" said she, laughing and shaking\r\nher head, \"I ain't going with any man. As I told Reube, I engaged more'n\r\na week ago to be a beau for Mrs. Jones. The squire won't go, 'n' Tom\r\nain't old enough to be much protection, you know, though he's going to\r\ndrive down with us. P'r'aps, if I dance at all, I'll give you a dance\r\nwhen we get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hain't no gre't fist at dancin', 'n' I hain't sure o' goin' ef you\r\nwon't go 'long o' me. Drusy, 'tain't none o' my business, 'n' I don't\r\nwant ter meddle, but it 'pears as some folks have been a-sayin' thet you\r\nhev got a--a feller down-river. 'N' you're a-doin' jest right. Don't go\r\nback on him, Drusy, fur no man that you ever liked could stan'\r\nthat,--never in the world. I don't catilate 'tis so 'coz you won't go\r\n'long o' me, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What right have folks to say or think any such thing?\" she asked\r\nindignantly, a painful crimson overspreading her whole face, her throat,\r\nand the tips of her small ears.\r\n\r\nBut the man's face was so white, so expressive of pain, that the look\r\nof anger melted into one of surprised pity.\r\n\r\n\"Drusy, we've got to git dinner fur twenty-five to-morrow. I'm afeard we\r\nshan't be very nimble fur the dance,\" said Mrs. Jones, appearing at that\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nBarker disappeared, and a few moments later was walking swiftly back\r\nagain to the camp, twelve miles through the lonely woods.\r\n\r\nContrary to prediction, the next morning was fair and bright, flushed\r\nwith pink and warmed with sunshine to its golden heart. It was\r\nacknowledged to be the \"beatinest\" winter weather that ever was\r\nknown,--a thaw that was not enough of a thaw to make the roads\r\nimpassable, and without rain. The rude little settlement was alive long\r\nbefore the sun was up. Candles and lanterns flitted to and fro. The\r\npeople were all eager and alert. Even the dogs and roosters seemed to\r\nfeel the unusual excitement in the air, and gave vent to their most\r\nprolonged and jubilant utterances. The storekeeper opened his\r\nestablishment at six o'clock, and found customers already waiting on the\r\nsteps. Sledges and sleighs came tinkling in from the woods and remote\r\nclearings. One young girl, wearing moccasins and a jaunty bear-skin\r\njacket, had walked five miles to borrow a white petticoat to wear to the\r\ndance. Another travelled ten, by way of an ox-team, to obtain a pair of\r\nopen-work stockings from a friend who was asthmatic and could not go.\r\nEven dresses were lent for the occasion; and during his ten years'\r\nsojourn at the settlement the storekeeper had never reaped such a\r\nharvest as he did on that day.\r\n\r\nToward night the air grew crisper and colder, as it had done on the day\r\nbefore. The sledge-runners crunched over the snow, and there was a\r\nlittle frosty tinkle to the bells, which woke every wood-track with its\r\ncheery melody, floated down the ice-bound river, echoed across the lake\r\nand along the well-trodden main road. The hall at the Forks where the\r\ndance was to be held--a bare, unfinished apartment, built for the use\r\nof, but not yet taken possession of by, the town--was decorated in the\r\nmost elaborate manner, but chiefly with small flags and strips of cloth\r\nin red, white, and blue, as if for some patriotic occasion. A stuffed\r\neagle nestled in a bower of evergreen, holding a banner emblazoned with\r\nthe stars and stripes in his huge bill. The clock was encircled in a\r\nwreath of paper roses, as was also the picture of Daniel Webster, which,\r\nhaving an oval frame, caused the great statesman to look as if he were\r\nmasquerading for a May queen.\r\n\r\nBarker arrived at the festive scene just in time to assist Mrs. Jones\r\nand Drusy from their sleigh. Dancing had already commenced, though it\r\nwas not yet eight o'clock. And what a motley crowd it was which moved to\r\nthe lively measures of \"Money Musk\"! Several of the ladies as well as\r\nthe men were tripping the \"light fantastic toe\" in moccasins. Girls in\r\ncalico gowns wore wreaths of artificial flowers upon their heads.\r\nHenrietta Blaisdell, a fat, shapeless girl with a freckled face, whose\r\nfather owned more pine timber than any other man in the county, wore\r\nblack silk, and was regarded with something like awe by the less\r\nfortunate ones in calico and homespun. Drusy was handsomer than ever, in\r\na soft woollen gown of dull blue, with a red rose in the masses of her\r\nblack hair and another at her throat. The schoolmistress, a pretty\r\nblonde, who was also a belle, wore white muslin, with a gay ribbon about\r\nher waist. Nearly all the men wore red shirts, but the tie of their\r\ncravats betokened careful study. Barker sported a gorgeous waistcoat,\r\nornamented with brilliant flowers of all the colors in the rainbow,\r\nwhich he had purchased for the occasion from the cook at the camp, who\r\nhad inherited it from an uncle that had died twenty years before. And\r\nfrom this same youth, who was too bashful to go to the dance himself, he\r\nobtained the loan of a pair of embroidered slippers which had been sent\r\nto him by a sister in the Far West. Wetherbee wore an ordinary cloth\r\nsuit, made by a city tailor, and was by far the best-dressed and most\r\ngentlemanly-looking man in the room.\r\n\r\nWhen Drusy appeared upon the scene he was dancing the first dance with\r\nHenrietta Blaisdell. He tossed her one of his pleasant smiles as he\r\nwhirled breathlessly past, and her eyes followed him with a look which\r\npoor Barker would have given worlds to interpret as he stood sad and\r\nhumble in all his unwonted magnificence by her side. The fiddler, who\r\nwas a tin-peddler and a poet and the teacher of a \"cipherin'-school,\" as\r\nwell as a musician, played with great gusto, and was continually calling\r\nupon the dancers to \"warm up 'n' shake their heels more lively.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, you Joe, you're quick enough at figgers, but you don't handle\r\nthem moggersons o' yourn in no kind er time,\" he shouted to a clumsy\r\nlumberman, whose partner, a stout, energetic young woman, was scarlet in\r\nthe face with her exertions to drag him about to the fierce time of the\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nDrusy laughed. \"I don't care about that kind of dancing,\" said she.\r\n\"It's a reg'lar whirlwind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a-goin' ter ask ye ter dance 'long o' me, Drusy, only I was 'most\r\nafeard tew, fur I knowed I shouldn't keep step,\" said Barker timidly.\r\n\"Reube seems ter be a-keepin' his balance fust-rate, but I hain't built\r\nso genteel es he is, nor hed the experiunce, neither.\" And he sighed\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't going to dance at all, John. I'd much rather look on. I think\r\nit's real fun to see 'em scramble about.\"\r\n\r\nHe brightened at this, but soon became a prey to melancholy again, for\r\nas soon as the dance was over a crowd of men pressed to Drusy's side.\r\nNot even Henrietta Blaisdell or the pretty schoolmistress received half\r\nas much attention. The fact of her being a \"hired girl\" at the \"tahvern\"\r\nrather added to than detracted from her social importance, and there was\r\na charm about her gay, gracious manner and bright beauty which was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\n\"Reube seems ter be tryin' tew make up with Henrietty ag'in,\" whispered\r\none of the lumbermen to his sweetheart. \"He's been kinder strayin' off\r\nin the direction of the tahvern lately; but pine timber's more takin'\r\nthen good looks tew some folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Likely ez not Drusy won't hev nothin' tew say tew him,\" said the girl.\r\n\"That gawky-lookin' John Barker 'pears tew be hangin' raound her\r\nconsid'able. 'Twould be kind er funny ef she should like him better.\"\r\nAnd she laughed scornfully.\r\n\r\nBarker overheard this, and the girl's words, and, above all, her\r\nlaughter, stung him to the quick. He leaned against the patriotic wall\r\nand meditated bitterly.\r\n\r\nReube came over and stood by Drusy's side, and they talked in a low,\r\ninterested tone. She never talked to him in that way, never listened to\r\nwhat he had to say with such half-shy, half-coquettish attention. But\r\nshe would not dance, even with Reube.\r\n\r\nThe sleigh-bells of some late-comers came tinkling up to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Sam, what's kept ye so? It's 'most nine o'clock,\" exclaimed one of\r\nthe lumbermen to a red-shirted comrade who came hurrying into their\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\n\"Sick man at the camp. The doctor from the Mills hez jest been ter see\r\nhim, but said he couldn't do nothin' fur him; reckoned he'd be a goner\r\nbefore mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sho! Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A feller by the name o' Seth Hardin'; boss in some lumber-consarn\r\ndaown-river; stopped ter the camp over-night on his way up ter Grand\r\nFalls, 'n' was took with fever 'n' ravin' like a muskeeter 'fore\r\nmornin'.\"\r\n\r\nDrusy's face, which was rosy and smiling as she stood watching the\r\nmovements of a contra-dance, suddenly blanched, and she grasped a wooden\r\npillar as if for support. Her very lips were white.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, Drusy?\" said Wetherbee, in a tone of gentle\r\nsolicitude.\r\n\r\nShe beckoned him aside.\r\n\r\n\"Reube,\" said she, the color surging into her cheeks again, \"I must go\r\nout to Fernald's camp. I must go at once. Oh, Reube! could you take me\r\nthere? Tom's gone over to the Point after his aunt Harriet with our\r\nteam, and there's no knowing when he'll get back. I _can't_ wait! I\r\n_must_ go, this moment!\" She clasped her hands tightly together and\r\nlooked pleadingly up into his face. \"Don't hesitate, Reube. That dying\r\nman is my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband!\" he exclaimed, with a strange flash in his mild blue\r\neyes, and with a pallor which almost equalled her own overspreading his\r\nface for an instant. \"I don't think you'd better set out for Fernald's\r\ncamp to-night, Drusy, 'Tis fifteen miles at the shortest, over the worst\r\nroad in the county. But if you think you must\" (he glanced at Henrietta\r\nBlaisdell, who was looking reproachfully at him, in all her bravery of\r\nblack silk), \"I--I might find somebody to take you. Maybe the boy over\r\nto Scott's stable, he'd know the way.\"\r\n\r\nDrusy gave him a look which he did not soon forget. Was there not more\r\nin it than baffled endeavor, than disappointed trust? Poor John Barker\r\nsaw it, and it lingered in his mind also. It was continually flashing\r\nbefore his vision for years.\r\n\r\n\"Drusy,\" said John, \"I hadn't no notion o' spyin' on yeou, but I was\r\na-standin' where I couldn't help overhearin' what yeou said. Yeou looked\r\nkinder faint, 'n'-- Lemme take yeou ter Fernald's camp. I hain't got\r\nnothin' to stop here fur, 'n' I kin git my hoss harnessed in a jiffy.\r\nSome o' the fellers from eour camp rid in weth me, but they kin git a\r\nchance on other teams,--'n' if not, they kin walk. I hain't got nothin'\r\nbut a hoss-sled to offer ye, but I guess I kin make it comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't speak of that, John: I shan't forget your kindness in a hurry,\"\r\nsaid Drusy, with trembling lip.\r\n\r\nThe dance went on with jocund carelessness. Wetherbee disappeared with a\r\nflushed and frowning countenance.\r\n\r\nThe horse-sled glided swiftly along over the crisp white road. The hills\r\nwere showing their barren beauty to the last look of the moon, which was\r\nsinking slowly out of sight. Sudden gleams of silver by the wayside\r\nbetrayed the abiding-place of frozen streams. A tall maple-tree lifted\r\nits bare branches to the sky, like skeleton fingers clutching a star.\r\n\r\nDrusy sat silent and motionless in the bottom of the sled, while Barker\r\nstood, tall and grim, beside her, holding the reins with a careful hand.\r\nIt was necessary for him to stand, that he might be able to see the\r\ncradle-holes and humps in the road ahead of them, he said. The moon had\r\ndisappeared when they entered the woods, and the dense darkness was only\r\nbroken by an occasional star-gleam overhead and the red light of the\r\nlantern which hung on one of the stakes of the sled.\r\n\r\n\"Drusy, did you care fur thet man thet's sick out ter the\r\ncamp--your--husban'?\" said Barker, breaking the silence in a hesitating\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did once, John, but he treated me badly; he--\" Her voice broke in\r\na great sob; and after that neither spoke until they reached the camp,\r\nthough it was nearly an hour later.\r\n\r\nThe way was long and rough, and the night was growing intensely cold.\r\nOnce or twice he bent down and tucked the robes more closely about her.\r\nBut she did not heed the cold: she was lost in her own thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe camp, which they reached just before midnight, made a bright spot in\r\nthe darkness of the woods. The fire-light shone through every chink in\r\nits dark logs, making red bars upon the snow.\r\n\r\nThe sick man was sleeping, and by his side sat the cook, who was acting\r\nas nurse, an old man who had been a sailor and wore gold rings in his\r\nears. He was sleeping also, and from two bunks on the opposite side of\r\nthe camp came the audible evidence that others were in a like condition.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he can't be so very bad: he can't be dying,\" said Drusy, seating\r\nherself on the deacon-seat at the foot of the sick man's bed and peering\r\nanxiously into his pinched and pallid face, which was illuminated by the\r\nrays of the great fire.\r\n\r\n\"'Pears ter be more comfortable; the fever's kind er left him; but the\r\ndoctor says he's goin' fast. Sleeps 'most all the time now, but he's\r\nmostly out of his head yit, pore feller! I hain't seen him ser quiet's\r\nhe is now fur days,\" said the old man drowsily.\r\n\r\nBarker, having put up his horse, seated himself beside the cook, who\r\nspeedily relapsed into slumber again, his grizzly head drooping upon his\r\nbreast. Drusy crept on to the edge of the bunk and softly wiped away the\r\nheavy moisture from the dying man's brow. He tossed uneasily upon his\r\nbed of hemlock boughs, but did not waken: his breathing was a perpetual\r\nmoan, his fingers picked restlessly at the bedclothing.\r\n\r\nThe wind rose and stirred about the camp like the rustle of mysterious\r\ngarments, and blew fitfully the varied pipes in the pine boughs. The\r\ngreat logs on the fire were dropping to scarlet coals, but Barker\r\nhastened to pile on more fuel, though there was still sufficient warmth\r\nfrom the huge pile. And so the night wore on. Toward morning the sick\r\nman opened his eyes and fixed them steadily upon Drusy's face.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know me, Seth?\" she asked, taking his hand within her own.\r\n\r\n\"Drusy, I ain't treated you well,--but you'll forgive me?\" He spoke\r\nslowly and painfully, making the most of his feeble breath. \"It's all\r\nover now, 'n' there's a little property left fur you. Squire Carter,\r\ndown home, 'll tell you about it. It's in his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Seth,\" sobbed Drusy, \"I have been wrong too. I wasn't half so\r\npatient 'n' forbearing as I ought to have been. I laid up things against\r\nyou that I ought to have forgot. Forgive me.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled, holding her hand with a faint pressure, then closed his eyes\r\nwearily and seemed to be sleeping.\r\n\r\nDrusy choked down her sobs and watched him almost breathlessly. His\r\nbreath grew fainter and fainter; he was quiet now, and seemed at peace.\r\n\r\nThe wind died away. The dawn marched, like some still procession,\r\ncarrying flickering torches, into the woods. Tiny shafts of flame shot\r\nthrough the dark pine branches. There was a bustle and rustle as of\r\nlight, hurrying feet. The clear clarion of the cocks sounded from\r\ndistant clearings. And with the first rays of the sun the soul of the\r\nsick man departed into the Unknown.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't there nothin' I kin do fur ye 'baout the funeril, Drusy, or\r\nkerryin' news tew the mourners?\" said Barker, as he was about to leave\r\nher at the door of the \"tahvern,\" toward noon of the same day.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank ye, John; you're as kind as a brother; but his folks will\r\nattend to all these things. The doctor's notified them already. His\r\nfather and two brothers are living down to Greenbush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll bid you good-by. I don't know when I shell see ye ag'in,\r\nDrusy.\"\r\n\r\nHastening back to his own camp, he told the overseer that he must find\r\nanother man to take his place in the gang; and, another being at hand\r\nwho was ready to take it, he started the very next morning on his way\r\ndown the frozen Penobscot.\r\n\r\n\"I must put a good many more'n fifteen miles between us, or I can't\r\nstan' it,\" he said to himself. \"She'll merry Reube in a year er tew, 'n'\r\nI won't never see her face ag'in. I warn't never superstitioned afore,\r\nbut when we was a-playin' them cards in that blarsted old camp I felt\r\nhow 'twas all a-goin' tew turn eout; as plain as A B C.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFour years passed away. Lake and river were unlocked by the spring rains\r\nand sunshine, and then locked again by the winter frosts. Axes rang in\r\nthe pine woods, great logs went floating down the stream. Life at the\r\nsettlement jogged on in the same old fashion. The lumbermen came out of\r\nthe woods and flirted and frolicked with the girls and sat about the\r\n\"tahvern\" fire in the long evenings. The few festivals were carried on\r\nwith the same old zest.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright afternoon. Drusy, who was still the hired girl at the\r\ntavern, in spite of the \"little property\" her husband had left her, was\r\nall alone in the kitchen, sitting pensively before the glowing stove.\r\nShe was little changed, save for a shade more of sadness in her eyes and\r\na somewhat fainter and more flickering fire upon her cheek.\r\n\r\nLost in thought, she did not heed the sleigh-bells which came tinkling\r\nup to the door, and a tall man, very much muffled in furs, had entered\r\nthe house unawares and stood beside her chair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John, how glad I am that you have come!\" she exclaimed, meeting his\r\nhonest, ugly smile. And she sprang from her seat with both hands\r\noutstretched toward him, a glad light overspreading her whole face.\r\n\"Where have you been all this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Daown-river, keepin' store. 'N' I shouldn't never 'a' come back, Drusy,\r\nonly I heard haow you wouldn't hev Reube, 'n' he'd gone back 'n' merried\r\nHenrietty. When I heard that I says tew myself, 'Naow I'll go up 'n' try\r\nmy hand, though 'tain't likely she'll hev enything favorable tew say tew\r\na gre't, rough, hulkin' feller like me.' Tell me, Drusy, could yeou ever\r\nthink o' hevin' me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could I ever? Why, I would have had you before, John, if you'd taken\r\nthe trouble to come up 'n' ask me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Jupiter! tew hear yeou say thet!\" he exclaimed, throwing his arms\r\nabout her in a perfect rapture of joy.\r\n\r\nAnd just then whom should fate send upon the scene but Reube Wetherbee!\r\nHe came in unobserved by the absorbed lovers, and stood gazing upon them\r\nwith a white face and flashing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Reube, four years ago, as p'r'aps you'll remember, I played a game, 'n'\r\nlost. Now I've been a-tryin' my hand ag'in, 'n' won,\" said John, who\r\nturned suddenly and saw him there.\r\n\r\n\"So I should suppose,\" said Reube, with a great effort to be hearty and\r\nfriendly as well as unconcerned. \"And I reckon 'twill be a wedding this\r\ntime instead of a dance.\"\r\n\r\nSUSAN HARTLEY SWETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was the evolution of a military horse-trade,--one of those periodical\r\nswappings required of his dragoons by Uncle Sam on those rare occasions\r\nwhen a regiment that has been dry-rotting half a decade in Arizona is at\r\nlast relieved by one from the Plains. How it happened that we of the\r\nFifth should have kept him from the clutches of those sharp\r\nhorse-fanciers of the Sixth is more than I know. Regimental tradition\r\nhad it that we got him from the Third Cavalry when it came our turn to\r\ngo into exile in 1871. He was the victim of some temporary malady at the\r\ntime,--one of those multitudinous ills to which horse-flesh is heir,--or\r\nhe never would have come to us. It was simply impossible that anybody\r\nwho knew anything about horses should trade off such a promising young\r\nracer so long as there remained an unpledged pay-account in the\r\nofficers' mess. Possibly the arid climate of Arizona had disagreed with\r\nhim and he had gone amiss, as would the mechanism of some of the best\r\nwatches in the regiment, unable to stand the strain of anything so hot\r\nand high and dry. Possibly the Third was so overjoyed at getting out of\r\nArizona on any terms that they would gladly have left their eye-teeth in\r\npawn. Whatever may have been the cause, the transfer was an accomplished\r\nfact, and Van was one of some seven hundred quadrupeds, of greater or\r\nless value, which became the property of the Fifth Regiment of Cavalry,\r\nU.S.A., in lawful exchange for a like number of chargers left in the\r\nstables along the recently-built Union Pacific to await the coming of\r\ntheir new riders from the distant West.\r\n\r\nWe had never met in those days, Van and I. \"Compadres\" and chums as we\r\nwere destined to become, we were utterly unknown and indifferent to each\r\nother; but in point of regimental reputation at the time, Van had\r\ndecidedly the best of it. He was a celebrity at head-quarters, I a\r\nsubaltern at an isolated post. He had apparently become acclimated, and\r\nwas rapidly winning respect for himself and dollars for his backers; I\r\nwas winning neither for anybody, and doubtless losing both,--they go\r\ntogether, somehow. Van was living on metaphorical clover down near\r\nTucson; I was roughing it out on the rocks of the Mogollon. Each after\r\nhis own fashion served out his time in the grim old Territory, and at\r\nlast \"came marching home again;\" and early in the summer of the\r\nCentennial year, and just in the midst of the great Sioux war of 1876,\r\nVan and I made each other's acquaintance.\r\n\r\nWhat I liked about him was the air of thoroughbred ease with which he\r\nadapted himself to his surroundings. He was in swell society on the\r\noccasion of our first meeting, being bestridden by the colonel of the\r\nregiment. He was dressed and caparisoned in the height of martial\r\nfashion; his clear eyes, glistening coat, and joyous bearing spoke of\r\nthe perfection of health; his every glance and movement told of elastic\r\nvigor and dauntless spirit. He was a horse with a pedigree,--let alone\r\nany self-made reputation,--and he knew it; more than that, he knew that\r\nI was charmed at the first greeting; probably he liked it, possibly he\r\nliked me. What he saw in me I never discovered. Van, though\r\ndemonstrative eventually, was reticent and little given to verbal\r\nflattery. It was long indeed before any degree of intimacy was\r\nestablished between us: perhaps it might never have come but for the\r\nstrange and eventful campaign on which we were so speedily launched.\r\nProbably we might have continued on our original status of dignified and\r\ndistant acquaintance. As a member of the colonel's household he could\r\nhave nothing in common with me or mine, and his acknowledgment of the\r\nintroduction of my own charger--the cavalryman's better half--was of\r\nthat airy yet perfunctory politeness which is of the club clubby.\r\nForager, my gray, had sought acquaintance in his impulsive frontier\r\nfashion when summoned to the presence of the regimental commander, and,\r\nranging alongside to permit the shake of the hand with which the colonel\r\nhad honored his rider, he himself had with equine confidence addressed\r\nVan, and Van had simply continued his dreamy stare over the springy\r\nprairie and taken no earthly notice of him. Forager and I had just\r\njoined regimental head-quarters for the first time, as was evident, and\r\nwe were both \"fresh.\" It was not until the colonel good-naturedly\r\nstroked the glossy brown neck of his pet and said, \"Van, old boy,\r\nthis is Forager, of 'K' troop,\" that Van considered it the proper\r\nthing to admit my fellow to the outer edge of his circle of acquaintance.\r\nMy gray thought him a supercilious snob, no doubt, and hated him. He\r\nhated him more before the day was half over, for the colonel decided\r\nto gallop down the valley to look at some new horses that had just\r\ncome, and invited me to go. Colonels' invitations are commands,\r\nand we went, Forager and I, though it was weariness and vexation of\r\nspirit to both. Van and his rider flew easily along, bounding over\r\nthe springy turf with long, elastic stride, horse and rider taking\r\nthe rapid motion as an every-day matter, in a cool, imperturbable,\r\nthis-is-the-way-we-always-do-it style, while my poor old troop-horse,\r\nin answer to pressing knee and pricking spur, strove with panting breath\r\nand jealously bursting heart to keep alongside. The foam flew from his\r\nfevered jaws and flecked the smooth flank of his apparently unconscious\r\nrival; and when at last we returned to camp, while Van, without a turned\r\nhair or an abnormal heave, coolly nodded off to his stable, poor\r\nForager, blown, sweating, and utterly used up, gazed revengefully after\r\nhim an instant and then reproachfully at me. He had done his best, and\r\nall to no purpose. That confounded clean-cut, supercilious beast had\r\nworn him out and never tried a spurt.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I began to make inquiries about that airy fellow Van,\r\nand I soon found he had a history. Like other histories, it may have\r\nbeen a mere codification of lies; but the men of the Fifth were ready to\r\nanswer for its authenticity, and Van fully looked the character they\r\ngave him. He was now in his prime. He had passed the age of tell-tale\r\nteeth and was going on between eight and nine, said the knowing ones,\r\nbut he looked younger and felt younger. He was at heart as full of fun\r\nand frolic as any colt, but the responsibilities of his position weighed\r\nupon him at times and lent to his elastic step the grave dignity that\r\nshould mark the movements of the first horse of the regiment.\r\n\r\nAnd then Van was a born aristocrat. He was not impressive in point of\r\nsize; he was rather small, in fact; but there was that in his bearing\r\nand demeanor that attracted instant attention. He was beautifully\r\nbuilt,--lithe, sinewy, muscular, with powerful shoulders and solid\r\nhaunches; his legs were what Oscar Wilde might have called poems, and\r\nwith better reason than when he applied the epithet to those of Henry\r\nIrving: they were straight, slender, and destitute of those heterodox\r\ndevelopments at the joints that render equine legs as hideous\r\ndeformities as knee-sprung trousers of the present mode. His feet and\r\npasterns were shapely and dainty as those of the _senoritas_ (only for\r\npastern read ankle) who so admired him on _festa_ days at Tucson, and\r\nwho won such stores of _dulces_ from the scowling gallants who had with\r\ngenuine Mexican pluck backed the Sonora horses at the races. His color\r\nwas a deep, dark chocolate-brown; a most unusual tint, but Van was proud\r\nof its oddity, and his long, lean head, his pretty little pointed ears,\r\nhis bright, flashing eye and sensitive nostril, one and all spoke of\r\nspirit and intelligence. A glance at that horse would tell the veriest\r\ngreenhorn that speed, bottom, and pluck were all to be found right\r\nthere; and he had not been in the regiment a month before the knowing\r\nones were hanging about the Mexican sports and looking out for a chance\r\nfor a match; and Mexicans, like Indians, are consummate horse-racers.\r\n\r\nNot with the \"greasers\" alone had tact and diplomacy to be brought into\r\nplay. Van, though invoiced as a troop-horse sick, had attracted the\r\nattention of the colonel from the very start, and the colonel had\r\nspeedily caused him to be transferred to his own stable, where,\r\ncarefully tended, fed, groomed, and regularly exercised, he speedily\r\ngave evidence of the good there was in him. The colonel rarely rode in\r\nthose days, and cavalry-duties in garrison were few. The regiment was in\r\nthe mountains most of the time, hunting Apaches, but Van had to be\r\nexercised every day; and exercised he was. \"Jeff,\" the colonel's\r\norderly, would lead him sedately forth from his paddock every morning\r\nabout nine, and ride demurely off toward the quartermaster's stables in\r\nrear of the garrison. Keen eyes used to note that Van had a way of\r\nsidling along at such times as though his heels were too impatient to\r\nkeep at their appropriate distance behind the head, and \"Jeff's\" hand on\r\nthe bit was very firm, light as it was.\r\n\r\n\"Bet you what you like those 'L' Company fellows are getting Van in\r\ntraining for a race,\" said the quartermaster to the adjutant one bright\r\nmorning, and the chuckle with which the latter received the remark was\r\nan indication that the news was no news to him.\r\n\r\n\"If old Coach don't find it out too soon, some of these swaggering\r\n_caballeros_ around here are going to lose their last winnings,\" was his\r\nanswer. And, true to their cavalry instincts, neither of the\r\nstaff-officers saw fit to follow Van and his rider beyond the gate to\r\nthe _corrals_.\r\n\r\nOnce there, however, Jeff would bound off quick as a cat, Van would be\r\nspeedily taken in charge by a squad of old dragoon sergeants, his\r\ncavalry bridle and saddle exchanged for a light racing-rig, and Master\r\nMickey Lanigan, son and heir of the regimental saddle-sergeant, would be\r\nhoisted into his throne, and then Van would be led off, all plunging\r\nimpatience now, to an improvised race-track across the _arroyo_, where\r\nhe would run against his previous record, and where old horses from the\r\ntroop-stables would be spurred into occasional spurts with the champion,\r\nwhile all the time vigilant _non-coms_ would be thrown out as pickets\r\nfar and near, to warn off prying Mexican eyes and give notice of the\r\ncoming of officers. The colonel was always busy in his office at that\r\nhour, and interruptions never came. But the race did, and more than one\r\nrace, too, occurring on Sundays, as Mexican races will, and well-nigh\r\nwrecking the hopes of the garrison on one occasion because of the\r\ncolonel's sudden freak of holding a long mounted inspection on that day.\r\nHad he ridden Van for two hours under his heavy weight and housings that\r\nmorning, all would have been lost. There was terror at Tucson when the\r\ncavalry trumpets blew the call for mounted inspection, full dress, that\r\nplacid Sunday morning, and the sporting sergeants were well-nigh crazed.\r\nNot an instant was to be lost. Jeff rushed to the stable, and in five\r\nminutes had Van's near fore foot enveloped in a huge poultice, much to\r\nVan's amaze and disgust, and when the colonel came down,\r\n\r\n  Booted and spurred and prepared for a ride,\r\n\r\nthere stood Jeff in martial solemnity, holding the colonel's other\r\nhorse, and looking, as did the horse, the picture of dejection.\r\n\r\n\"What'd you bring me that infernal old hearse-horse for?\" said the\r\ncolonel. \"Where's Van?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the stable, dead lame, general,\" said Jeff, with face of woe, but\r\nwith diplomatic use of the brevet. \"Can't put his nigh fore foot to the\r\nground, sir. I've got it poulticed, sir, and he'll be all right in a day\r\nor two--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it ain't a nail?\" broke in the colonel, to whom nails in the foot\r\nwere sources of perennial dread.\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly sure, general,\" gasped Jeff. \"D--d sure!\" he added, in a tone\r\nof infinite relief, as the colonel rode out on the broad parade.\r\n\"'Twould 'a' been nails in the coffins of half the Fifth Cavalry if it\r\n_had_ been.\"\r\n\r\nBut that afternoon, while the colonel was taking his siesta, half the\r\npopulace of the good old Spanish town of Tucson was making the air blue\r\nwith _carambas_ when Van came galloping under the string an easy winner\r\nover half a score of Mexican steeds. The \"dark horse\" became a\r\nnotoriety, and for once in its history head-quarters of the Fifth\r\nCavalry felt the forthcoming visit of the paymaster to be an object of\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nVan won other races in Arizona. No more betting could be got against him\r\naround Tucson; but the colonel went off on leave, and he was borrowed\r\ndown at Camp Bowie awhile, and then transferred to Crittenden,--only\r\ntemporarily, of course, for no one at head-quarters would part with him\r\nfor good. Then, when the regiment made its homeward march across the\r\ncontinent in 1875, Van somehow turned up at the _festa_ races at\r\nAlbuquerque and Santa Fe, though the latter was off the line of march by\r\nmany miles. Then he distinguished himself at Pueblo by winning a\r\nhandicap sweepstakes where the odds were heavy against him. And so it\r\nwas that when I met Van at Fort Hays in May, 1876, he was a celebrity.\r\nEven then they were talking of getting him down to Dodge City to run\r\nagainst some horses on the Arkansaw; but other and graver matters turned\r\nup. Van had run his last race.\r\n\r\nEarly that spring, or rather late in the winter, a powerful expedition\r\nhad been sent to the north of Fort Fetterman in search of the hostile\r\nbands led by that dare-devil Sioux chieftain Crazy Horse. On \"Patrick's\r\nDay in the morning,\" with the thermometer indicating 30 deg. below, and in\r\nthe face of a biting wind from the north and a blazing glare from the\r\nsheen of the untrodden snow, the cavalry came in sight of the Indian\r\nencampment down in the valley of Powder River. The fight came off then\r\nand there, and, all things considered, Crazy Horse got the best of it.\r\nHe and his people drew away farther north to join other roving bands.\r\nThe troops fell back to Fetterman to get a fresh start; and when spring\r\nfairly opened, old \"Gray Fox,\" as the Indians called General Crook,\r\nmarched a strong command up to the Big Horn Mountains, determined to\r\nhave it out with Crazy Horse and settle the question of supremacy before\r\nthe end of the season. Then all the unoccupied Indians in the North\r\ndecided to take a hand. All or most of them were bound by treaty\r\nobligations to keep the peace with the government that for years past\r\nhad fed, clothed, and protected them. Nine-tenths of those who rushed to\r\nthe rescue of Crazy Horse and his people had not the faintest excuse for\r\ntheir breach of faith; but it requires neither eloquence nor excuse to\r\npersuade the average Indian to take the war-path. The reservations were\r\nbeset by vehement old strifemongers preaching a crusade against the\r\nwhites, and by early June there must have been five thousand eager young\r\nwarriors, under such leaders as Crazy Horse, Gall, Little Big Man, and\r\nall manner of Wolves, Bears, and Bulls, and prominent among the latter\r\nthat head-devil, scheming, lying, wire-pulling, big-talker-but-no-fighter,\r\nSitting Bull,--\"Tatanka-e-Yotanka,\"--five thousand fierce and eager\r\nIndians, young and old, swarming through the glorious upland between the\r\nBig Horn and the Yellowstone, and more a-coming.\r\n\r\nCrook had reached the head-waters of Tongue River with perhaps twelve\r\nhundred cavalry and infantry, and found that something must be done to\r\nshut off the rush of reinforcements from the southeast. Then it was that\r\nwe of the Fifth, far away in Kansas, were hurried by rail through Denver\r\nto Cheyenne, marched thence to the Black Hills to cut the trails from\r\nthe great reservations of Red Cloud and Spotted Tail to the disputed\r\nground of the Northwest; and here we had our own little personal tussle\r\nwith the Cheyennes, and induced them to postpone their further progress\r\ntoward Sitting Bull and to lead us back to the reservation. It was here,\r\ntoo, we heard how Crazy Horse had pounced on Crook's columns on the\r\nbluffs of the Rosebud that sultry morning of the 17th of June and showed\r\nthe Gray Fox that he and his people were too weak in numbers to cope\r\nwith them. It was here, too, worse luck, we got the tidings of the dread\r\ndisaster of the Sunday one week later, and listened in awed silence to\r\nthe story of Custer's mad attack on ten times his weight in foes--and\r\nthe natural result. Then came our orders to hasten to the support of\r\nCrook, and so it happened that July found us marching for the storied\r\nrange of the Big Horn, and the first week in August landed us, blistered\r\nand burned with sun-glare and stifling alkali-dust, in the welcoming\r\ncamp of Crook.\r\n\r\nThen followed the memorable campaign of 1876. I do not mean to tell its\r\nstory here. We set out with ten days' rations on a chase that lasted ten\r\nweeks. We roamed some eighteen hundred miles over range and prairie,\r\nover \"bad lands\" and worse waters. We wore out some Indians, a good many\r\nsoldiers, and a great many horses. We sometimes caught the Indians, and\r\nsometimes they caught us. It was hot, dry summer weather when we left\r\nour wagons, tents, and extra clothing; it was sharp and freezing before\r\nwe saw them again; and meantime, without a rag of canvas or any covering\r\nto our backs except what summer-clothing we had when we started, we had\r\ntramped through the valleys of the Rosebud, Tongue, and Powder Rivers,\r\nhad loosened the teeth of some men with scurvy before we struck the\r\nYellowstone, had weeded out the wounded and ineffective there and sent\r\nthem to the East by river, had taken a fresh start and gone rapidly on\r\nin pursuit of the scattering bands, had forded the Little Missouri near\r\nwhere the Northern Pacific now spans the stream, run out of rations\r\nentirely at the head of Heart River, and still stuck to the trail and\r\nthe chase, headed southward over rolling, treeless prairies, and for\r\neleven days and nights of pelting, pitiless rain dragged our way through\r\nthe bad-lands, meeting and fighting the Sioux two lively days among the\r\nrocks of Slim Buttes, subsisting meantime partly on what game we could\r\npick up, but mainly upon our poor, famished, worn-out, staggering\r\nhorses. It is hard truth for cavalryman to tell, but the choice lay\r\nbetween them and our boots; and most of us had no boots left by the time\r\nwe sighted the Black Hills. Once there, we found provisions and plenty;\r\nbut never, I venture to say, never was civilized army in such a plight\r\nas was the command of General George Crook when his brigade of regulars\r\nhalted on the north bank of the Belle Fourche in September, 1876.\r\nOfficers and men were ragged, haggard, half starved, worn down to mere\r\nskin and bone; and the horses--ah, well, only half of them were left:\r\nhundreds had dropped starved and exhausted on the line of march, and\r\ndozens had been killed and eaten. We had set out blithe and merry,\r\nriding jauntily down the wild valley of the Tongue. We straggled in\r\ntoward the Hills, towing our tottering horses behind us: they had long\r\nsince grown too weak to carry a rider.\r\n\r\nThen came a leisurely saunter through the Hills. Crook bought up all the\r\nprovisions to be had in Deadwood and other little mining towns, turned\r\nover the command to General Merritt, and hastened to the forts to\r\norganize a new force, leaving to his successor instructions to come in\r\nslowly, giving horses and men time to build up. Men began \"building up\"\r\nfast enough; we did nothing but eat, sleep, and hunt grass for our\r\nhorses for whole weeks at a time; but our horses,--ah, that was\r\ndifferent. There was no grain to be had for them. They had been starving\r\nfor a month, for the Indians had burned the grass before us wherever we\r\nwent, and here in the pine-covered hills what grass could be found was\r\nscant and wiry,--not the rich, juicy, strength-giving bunch-grass of the\r\nopen country. Of my two horses, neither was in condition to do military\r\nduty when we got to Whitewood. I was adjutant of the regiment, and had\r\nto be bustling around a good deal; and so it happened that one day the\r\ncolonel said to me, \"Well, here's Van. He can't carry my weight any\r\nlonger. Suppose you take him and see if he won't pick up.\" And that\r\nbeautiful October day found the racer of the regiment, though the ghost\r\nof his former self, transferred to my keeping.\r\n\r\nAll through the campaign we had been getting better acquainted, Van and\r\nI. The colonel seldom rode him, but had him led along with the\r\nhead-quarters party in the endeavor to save his strength. A big,\r\nraw-boned colt, whom he had named \"Chunka Witko,\" in honor of the Sioux\r\n\"Crazy Horse,\" the hero of the summer, had the honor of transporting the\r\ncolonel over most of those weary miles, and Van spent the long days on\r\nthe muddy trail in wondering when and where the next race was to come\r\noff, and whether at this rate he would be fit for a finish. One day on\r\nthe Yellowstone I had come suddenly upon a quartermaster who had a peck\r\nof oats on his boat. Oats were worth their weight in greenbacks, but so\r\nwas plug tobacco. He gave me half a sack for all the tobacco in my\r\nsaddle-bags, and, filling my old campaign hat with the precious grain, I\r\nsat me down on a big log by the flowing Yellowstone and told poor old\r\n\"Donnybrook\" to pitch in. \"Donnybrook\" was a \"spare horse\" when we\r\nstarted on the campaign, and had been handed over to me after the fight\r\non the War Bonnet, where Merritt turned their own tactics on the\r\nCheyennes. He was sparer still by this time; and later, when we got to\r\nthe muddy banks of the \"Heecha Wapka,\" there was nothing to spare of\r\nhim. The head-quarters party had dined on him the previous day, and only\r\ngroaned when that Mark Tapley of a surgeon remarked that if this was\r\nDonnybrook Fare it was tougher than all the stories ever told of it.\r\nPoor old Donnybrook! He had recked not of the coming woe that blissful\r\nhour by the side of the rippling Yellowstone. His head was deep in my\r\nlap, his muzzle buried in oats; he took no thought for the morrow,--he\r\nwould eat, drink, and be merry, and ask no questions as to what was to\r\nhappen; and so absorbed were we in our occupation--he in his happiness,\r\nI in the contemplation thereof--that neither of us noticed the rapid\r\napproach of a third party until a whinny of astonishment sounded close\r\nbeside us, and Van, trailing his lariat and picket-pin after him, came\r\ntrotting up, took in the situation at a glance, and, unhesitatingly\r\nranging alongside his comrade of coarser mould and thrusting his velvet\r\nmuzzle into my lap, looked wistfully into my face with his great soft\r\nbrown eyes and plead for his share. Another minute, and, despite the\r\nchurlish snappings and threatening heels of Donnybrook, Van was supplied\r\nwith a portion as big as little Benjamin's, and, stretching myself\r\nbeside him on the sandy shore, I lay and watched his enjoyment. From\r\nthat hour he seemed to take me into his confidence, and his was a\r\nfriendship worth having. Time and again on the march to the Little\r\nMissouri and southward to the Hills he indulged me with some slight but\r\nunmistakable proof that he held me in esteem and grateful remembrance.\r\nIt may have been only a bid for more oats, but he kept it up long after\r\nhe knew there was not an oat in Dakota,--that part of it, at least. But\r\nVan was awfully pulled down by the time we reached the pine-barrens up\r\nnear Deadwood. The scanty supply of forage there obtained (at starvation\r\nprice) would not begin to give each surviving horse in the three\r\nregiments a mouthful. And so by short stages we plodded along through\r\nthe picturesque beauty of the wild Black Hills, and halted at last in\r\nthe deep valley of French Creek. Here there was grass for the horses and\r\nrest for the men.\r\n\r\nFor a week now Van had been my undivided property, and was the object of\r\ntender solicitude on the part of my German orderly, \"Preuss,\" and\r\nmyself. The colonel had chosen for his house the foot of a big pine-tree\r\nup a little ravine, and I was billeted alongside a fallen ditto a few\r\nyards away. Down the ravine, in a little clump of trees, the\r\nhead-quarters stables were established, and here were gathered at\r\nnightfall the chargers of the colonel and his staff. Custer City, an\r\nalmost deserted village, lay but a few miles off to the west, and\r\nthither I had gone the moment I could get leave, and my mission was\r\noats. Three stores were still open, and, now that the troops had come\r\nswarming down, were doing a thriving business. Whiskey, tobacco, bottled\r\nbeer, canned lobster, canned anything, could be had in profusion, but\r\nnot a grain of oats, barley, or corn. I went over to a miners'\r\nwagon-train and offered ten dollars for a sack of oats. The boss\r\nteamster said he would not sell oats for a cent apiece if he had them,\r\nand so sent me back down the valley sore at heart, for I knew Van's\r\neyes, those great soft brown eyes, would be pleading the moment I came\r\nin sight; and I knew more,--that somewhere the colonel had \"made a\r\nraise,\" that he _had_ one sack, for Preuss had seen it, and Chunka Witko\r\nhad had a peck of oats the night before and another that very morning.\r\nSure enough, Van was waiting, and the moment he saw me coming up the\r\nravine he quit his munching at the scanty herbage, and, with ears erect\r\nand eager eyes, came quickly toward me, whinnying welcome and inquiry at\r\nthe same instant. Sugar and hard-tack, delicacies he often fancied in\r\nprosperous times, he took from my hand even now; he was too truly a\r\ngentleman at heart to refuse them when he saw they were all I had to\r\ngive; but he could not understand why the big colt should have his oats\r\nand he, Van, the racer and the hero of two months ago, should starve,\r\nand I could not explain it.\r\n\r\nThat night Preuss came up and stood attention before my fire, where I\r\nsat jotting down some memoranda in a note-book:\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant, I kent shtaendt ut no longer yet. Dot scheneral's horse he\r\ngit oats ag'in diesen abent, unt Ven he git noddings, unt he look, unt\r\nlook. He ot dot golt unt den ot me look, unt I _couldn't_ shtaendt ut,\r\nlieutenant--\"\r\n\r\nAnd Preuss stopped short and winked hard and drew his ragged\r\nshirt-sleeve across his eyes.\r\n\r\nNeither could I \"shtaendt ut.\" I jumped up and went to the colonel and\r\nbegged a hatful of his precious oats, not for my sake, but for Van's.\r\n\"Self-preservation is the first law of nature,\" and your own horse\r\nbefore that of all the world is the cavalryman's creed. It was a heap to\r\nask, but Van's claim prevailed, and down the dark ravine \"in the\r\ngloaming\" Preuss and I hastened with eager steps and two hats full of\r\noats; and that rascal Van heard us laugh, and answered with impatient\r\nneigh. He knew we had not come empty-handed this time.\r\n\r\nNext morning, when every sprig and leaf was glistening in the brilliant\r\nsunshine with its frosty dew, Preuss led Van away up the ravine to\r\npicket him on a little patch of grass he had discovered the day before,\r\nand as he passed the colonel's fire a keen-eyed old veteran of the\r\ncavalry service, who had stopped to have a chat with our chief, dropped\r\nthe stick on which he was whittling and stared hard at our attenuated\r\nracer.\r\n\r\n\"Whose horse is that, orderly?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"De _etschudant's_, colonel,\" said Preuss, in his labored dialect.\r\n\r\n\"The adjutant's! Where did he get him? Why, that horse is a runner!\"\r\nsaid Black Bill appreciatively.\r\n\r\nAnd pretty soon Preuss came back to me, chuckling. He had not smiled for\r\nsix weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Ven he veels pully dis morning,\" he explained. \"Dot Colonel Royle he\r\nshpeak mit him unt pet him, unt Ven he laeff unt gick up mit his hint\r\nlecks. He git vell bretty gwick yet.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward we broke up our bivouac on French Creek, for every\r\nblade of grass was eaten off, and pushed over the hills to its near\r\nneighbor, Amphibious Creek, an eccentric stream, whose habit of diving\r\ninto the bowels of the earth at unexpected turns and disappearing from\r\nsight entirely, only to come up surging and boiling some miles farther\r\ndown the valley, had suggested its singular name. \"It was half land,\r\nhalf water,\" explained the topographer of the first expedition that had\r\nlocated and named the streams in these jealously-guarded haunts of the\r\nred men. Over on Amphibious Creek we were joined by a motley gang of\r\nrecruits just enlisted in the distant cities of the East and sent out to\r\nhelp us fight Indians. One out of ten might know how to load a gun, but\r\nas frontier soldiers not one in fifty was worth having. But they brought\r\nwith them capital horses, strong, fat, grain-fed, and these we\r\ncampaigners levied on at once. Merritt led the old soldiers and the new\r\nhorses down into the valley of the Cheyenne on a chase after some\r\nscattering Indian bands, while \"Black Bill\" was left to hammer the\r\nrecruits into shape and teach them how to care for invalid horses. Two\r\nhandsome young sorrels had come to me as my share of the plunder, and\r\nwith these for alternate mounts I rode the Cheyenne raid, leaving Van to\r\nthe fostering care of the gallant old cavalryman who had been so struck\r\nwith his points the week previous.\r\n\r\nOne week more, and the reunited forces of the expedition, Van and all,\r\ntrotted in to \"round up\" the semi-belligerent warriors at the Red Cloud\r\nagency on White River, and, as the war-ponies and rifles of the scowling\r\nbraves were distributed among the loyal scouts and dethroned Machpealota\r\n(old Red Cloud) turned over the government of the great Sioux nation,\r\nOgallallas and all, to his more reliable rival, Sintegaliska,--Spotted\r\nTail,--Van surveyed the ceremony of abdication from between my legs, and\r\nhad the honor of receiving an especial pat and an admiring \"_Washtay_\"\r\nfrom the new chieftain and lord of the loyal Sioux. His highness Spotted\r\nTail was pleased to say that he wouldn't mind swapping four of his\r\nponies for Van, and made some further remarks which my limited knowledge\r\nof the Brule Dakota tongue did not enable me to appreciate as they\r\ndeserved. The fact that the venerable chieftain had hinted that he might\r\nbe induced to throw in a spare squaw \"to boot\" was therefore lost, and\r\nVan was saved. Early November found us, after an all-summer march of\r\nsome three thousand miles, once more within sight and sound of\r\ncivilization. Van and I had taken station at Fort D. A. Russell, and\r\nthe bustling prairie city of Cheyenne lay only three miles away. Here it\r\nwas that Van became my pet and pride. Here he lived his life of ease and\r\ntriumph, and here, gallant fellow, he met his knightly fate.\r\n\r\nOnce settled at Russell, all the officers of the regiment who were\r\nblessed with wives and children were speedily occupied in getting their\r\nquarters ready for their reception; and late in November my own little\r\nhousehold arrived and were presented to Van. He was then domesticated in\r\na rude but comfortable stable in rear of my little army-house, and there\r\nhe slept, was groomed and fed, but never confined. He had the run of our\r\nyard, and, after critical inspection of the wood-shed, the coal-hole,\r\nand the kitchen, Van seemed to decide upon the last-named as his\r\nfavorite resort. He looked with curious and speculative eyes upon our\r\ndarky cook on the arrival of that domestic functionary, and seemed for\r\nonce in his life to be a trifle taken aback by the sight of her woolly\r\npate and Ethiopian complexion. Hannah, however, was duly instructed by\r\nher mistress to treat Van on all occasions with great consideration, and\r\nthis to Hannah's darkened intellect meant unlimited loaf-sugar. The\r\nadjutant could not fail to note that Van was almost always to be seen\r\nstanding at the kitchen door, and on those rare occasions when he\r\nhimself was permitted to invade those premises he was never surprised to\r\nfind Van's shapely head peering in at the window, or head, neck, and\r\nshoulders bulging in at the wood-shed beyond.\r\n\r\nYet the ex-champion and racer did not live an idle existence. He had his\r\nhours of duty, and keenly relished them. Office-work over at\r\norderly-call at high noon it was the adjutant's custom to return to his\r\nquarters and speedily to appear in riding-dress on the front piazza. At\r\nabout the same moment Van, duly caparisoned, would be led forth from his\r\npaddock, and in another moment he and his rider would be flying off\r\nacross the breezy level of the prairie. Cheyenne, as has been said, lay\r\njust three miles away, and thither Van would speed with long, elastic\r\nstrides, as though glorying in his powers. It was at once his exercise\r\nand his enjoyment, and to his rider it was the best hour of the day. He\r\nrode alone, for no horse at Russell could keep alongside. He rode at\r\nfull speed, for in all the twenty-four that hour from twelve to one was\r\nthe only one he could call his own for recreation and for healthful\r\nexercise. He rode to Cheyenne that he might be present at the event of\r\nthe day,--the arrival of the trans-continental train from the East. He\r\nsometimes rode beyond, that he might meet the train when it was belated\r\nand race it back to town; and this--_this_ was Van's glory. The rolling\r\nprairie lay open and free on each side of the iron track, and Van soon\r\nlearned to take his post upon a little mound whence the coming of the\r\n\"express\" could be marked, and, as it flared into sight from the\r\ndarkness of the distant snow-shed, Van, all a-tremble with excitement,\r\nwould begin to leap and plunge and tug at the bit and beg for the word\r\nto go. Another moment, and, carefully held until just as the puffing\r\nengine came well alongside, Van would leap like arrow from the string,\r\nand away we would speed, skimming along the springy turf. Sometimes the\r\nengineer would curb his iron horse and hold him back against the\r\n\"down-grade\" impetus of the heavy Pullmans far in rear; sometimes he\r\nwould open his throttle and give her full head, and the long train would\r\nseem to leap into space, whirling clouds of dust from under the whirring\r\nwheels, and then Van would almost tear his heart out to keep alongside.\r\n\r\nMonth after month through the sharp mountain winter, so long as the snow\r\nwas not whirling through the air in clouds too dense to penetrate, Van\r\nand his master had their joyous gallops. Then came the spring, slow,\r\nshy, and reluctant as the springtide sets in on that high plateau in\r\nmid-continent, and Van had become even more thoroughly domesticated. He\r\nnow looked upon himself as one of the family, and he knew the\r\ndining-room window, and there, thrice each day and sometimes at odd\r\nhours between, he would take his station while the household was at\r\ntable and plead with those great soft brown eyes for sugar.\r\nCommissary-bills ran high that winter, and cut loaf-sugar was an item of\r\nuntold expenditure. He had found a new ally and friend,--a little girl\r\nwith eyes as deep and dark as and browner than his own, a winsome little\r\nmaid of three, whose golden, sunshiny hair floated about her bonny head\r\nand sweet serious face like a halo of light from another world. Van\r\n\"took to her\" from the very first. He courted the caress of her little\r\nhand, and won her love and trust by the discretion of his movements when\r\nshe was near. As soon as the days grew warm enough, she was always out\r\non the front piazza when Van and I came home from our daily gallop, and\r\nthen she would trot out to meet us and be lifted to her perch on the\r\npommel; and then, with mincing gait, like lady's palfrey, stepping as\r\nthough he might tread on eggs and yet not crush them, Van would take the\r\nlittle one on her own share of the ride. And so it was that the loyal\r\nfriendship grew and strengthened. The one trick he had was never\r\nventured upon when she was on his back, even after she became accustomed\r\nto riding at rapid gait and enjoying the springy canter over the prairie\r\nbefore Van went back to his stable. It was a strange trick: it proved a\r\nfatal one.\r\n\r\nNo other horse I ever rode had one just like it. Running at full speed,\r\nhis hoofs fairly flashing through the air and never seeming to touch the\r\nground, he would suddenly, as it were, \"change step\" and gallop\r\n\"disunited,\" as we cavalrymen would say. At first I thought it must be\r\nthat he struck some rolling stone, but soon I found that when bounding\r\nover the soft turf it was just the same; and the men who knew him in the\r\ndays of his prime in Arizona had noted it there. Of course there was\r\nnothing to do for it but make him change back as quick as possible on\r\nthe run, for Van was deaf to remonstrance and proof against the rebuke\r\nof spur. Perhaps he could not control the fault; at all events he did\r\nnot, and the effect was not pleasant. The rider felt a sudden jar, as\r\nthough the horse had come down stiff-legged from a hurdle-leap; and\r\nsometimes it would be so sharp as to shake loose the forage-cap upon his\r\nrider's head. He sometimes did it when going at easy lope, but never\r\nwhen his little girl-friend was on his back: then he went on springs of\r\nair.\r\n\r\nOne bright May morning all the different \"troops,\" as the\r\ncavalry-companies are termed, were out at drill on the broad prairie.\r\nThe colonel was away, the officer of the day was out drilling his own\r\ncompany, the adjutant was seated in his office hard at work over\r\nregimental papers, when in came the sergeant of the guard, breathless\r\nand excited.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant,\" he cried, \"six general prisoners have escaped from the\r\nguard-house. They have got away down the creek toward town.\"\r\n\r\nIn hurried question and answer the facts were speedily brought out. Six\r\nhard customers, awaiting sentence after trial for larceny, burglary,\r\nassault with intent to kill, and finally desertion, had been cooped up\r\ntogether in an inner room of the ramshackle old wooden building that\r\nserved for a prison, had sawed their way through to open air, and,\r\ntiming their essay by the sound of the trumpets that told them the whole\r\ngarrison would be out at morning drill, had slipped through the gap at\r\nthe right moment, slid down the hill into the creek-bottom, and then\r\nscurried off townward. A sentinel down near the stables had caught sight\r\nof them, but they were out of view long before his shouts had summoned\r\nthe corporal of the guard.\r\n\r\nNo time was to be lost. They were malefactors and vagabonds of the worst\r\ncharacter. Two of their number had escaped before and had made it their\r\nboast that they could break away from the Russell guard at any time.\r\nDirecting the sergeant to return to his guard, and hurriedly scribbling\r\na note to the officer of the day, who had his whole troop with him in\r\nthe saddle out on the prairie, and sending it by the hand of the\r\nsergeant-major, the adjutant hurried to his own quarters and called for\r\nVan. The news had reached there already. News of any kind travels like\r\nwild-fire in a garrison, and Van was saddled and bridled before the\r\nadjutant reached the gate.\r\n\r\n\"Bring me my revolver and belt,--quick,\" he said to the servant, as he\r\nswung into saddle. The man darted into the house and came back with the\r\nbelt and holster.\r\n\r\n\"I was cleaning your Colt, sir,\" he said, \"but here's the Smith &\r\nWesson,\" handing up the burnished nickel-plated weapon then in use\r\nexperimentally on the frontier. Looking only to see that fresh\r\ncartridges were in each chamber and that the hammer was on the\r\nsafety-notch, the adjutant thrust it into the holster, and in an instant\r\nhe and Van flew through the east gate in rapid pursuit.\r\n\r\nOh, how gloriously Van ran that day! Out on the prairie, the gay guidons\r\nof the troops were fluttering in the brilliant sunshine; here, there,\r\neverywhere, the skirmish-lines and reserves were dotting the plain; the\r\nair was ringing with the merry trumpet-calls and the stirring words of\r\ncommand. Yet men forgot their drill and reined up on the line to watch\r\nVan as he flashed by, wondering, too, what could take the adjutant off\r\nat such an hour and at such a pace.\r\n\r\n\"What's the row?\" shouted the commanding officer of one company.\r\n\r\n\"Prisoners loose,\" was the answer shouted back, but only indistinctly\r\nheard. On went Van like one inspired, and as we cleared the drill-ground\r\nand got well out on the open plain in long sweeping curve, we changed\r\nour course, aiming more to the right, so as to strike the valley west of\r\nthe town. It was possible to get there first and head them off. Then\r\nsuddenly I became aware of something jolting up and down behind me. My\r\nhand went back in search: there was no time to look: the prairie just\r\nhere was cut up with little gopher-holes and criss-crossed by tiny\r\ncanals from the main _acequia_, or irrigating ditch. It was that\r\nwretched Smith & Wesson bobbing up and down in the holster. The Colt\r\nrevolver of the day was a trifle longer, and my man in changing pistols\r\nhad not thought to change holsters. This one, made for the Colt, was too\r\nlong and loose by half an inch, and the pistol was pounding up and down\r\nwith every stride. Just ahead of us came the flash of the sparkling\r\nwater in one of the little ditches. Van cleared it in his stride with no\r\neffort whatever. Then, just beyond,--oh, fatal trick!--seemingly when in\r\nmid-air he changed step, striking the ground with a sudden shock that\r\njarred us both and flung the downward-pointed pistol up against the\r\nclosely-buttoned holster-flap. There was a sharp report, and my heart\r\nstood still an instant. I knew--oh, well I knew it was the death-note of\r\nmy gallant pet. On he went, never swaying, never swerving, never\r\nslackening his racing speed; but, turning in the saddle and glancing\r\nback, I saw, just back of the cantle, just to the right of the spine in\r\nthe glossy brown back, that one tiny, grimy, powder-stained hole. I knew\r\nthe deadly bullet had ranged downward through his very vitals. I knew\r\nthat Van had run his last race, was even now rushing toward a goal he\r\nwould never reach. Fast as he might fly, he could not leave Death\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe chase was over. Looking back, I could see the troopers already\r\nhastening in pursuit, but we were out of the race. Gently, firmly I drew\r\nthe rein. Both hands were needed, for Van had never stopped here, and\r\nsome strange power urged him on now. Full three hundred yards he ran\r\nbefore he would consent to halt. Then I sprang from the saddle and ran\r\nto his head. His eyes met mine. Soft and brown, and larger than ever,\r\nthey gazed imploringly. Pain and bewilderment, strange, wistful\r\npleading, but all the old love and trust, were there as I threw my arms\r\nabout his neck and bowed his head upon my breast. I could not bear to\r\nmeet his eyes. I could not look into them and read there the deadly pain\r\nand faintness that were rapidly robbing them of their lustre, but that\r\ncould not shake their faith in his friend and master. No wonder mine\r\ngrew sightless as his own through swimming tears. I who had killed him\r\ncould not face his last conscious gaze.\r\n\r\nOne moment more, and, swaying, tottering first from side to side, poor\r\nVan fell with heavy thud upon the turf. Kneeling, I took his head in my\r\narms and strove to call back one sign of recognition; but all that was\r\ngone. Van's spirit was ebbing away in some fierce, wild dream: his\r\nglazing eyes were fixed on vacancy; his breath came in quick, convulsive\r\ngasps; great tremors shook his frame, growing every instant more\r\nviolent. Suddenly a fiery light shot into his dying eyes. The old high\r\nmettle leaped to vivid life, and then, as though the flag had dropped,\r\nthe starting drum had tapped, Van's fleeting spirit whirled into his\r\ndying race. Lying on his side, his hoofs flew through the air, his\r\npowerful limbs worked back and forth swifter than ever in their swiftest\r\ngallop, his eyes were aflame, his nostrils wide distended, his chest\r\nheaving, and his magnificent machinery running like lightning. Only for\r\na minute, though,--only for one short, painful minute. It was only a\r\nhalf-mile dash,--poor old fellow!--only a hopeless struggle against a\r\nrival that never knew defeat. Suddenly all ceased as suddenly as all\r\nbegan. One stiffening quiver, one long sigh, and my pet and pride was\r\ngone. Old friends were near him even then. \"I was with him when he won\r\nhis first race at Tucson,\" said old Sergeant Donnelly, who had ridden to\r\nour aid, \"and I knowed then he would die racing.\"\r\n\r\nCHARLES KING, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pale Grief with tender Joy is at strife,\r\n    And Joy is wounded and nigh to death.\r\n  Their quarrel is old,--as old as life,--\r\n    \"And Grief is right,\" the sad world saith.\r\n      But, hark! from yonder wood\r\n        The blackbird singeth gay,\r\n      \"Joy is in the right of it,\r\n      And Grief is in the wrong of it,\r\n        Whatever the world may say.\"\r\n\r\n  Dull Age with radiant Youth is at strife,\r\n    And Youth draws harder and harder breath.\r\n  Their quarrel is old,--as old as life,--\r\n    \"And Age is right,\" the gray world saith.\r\n      But, hark! from yonder wood\r\n        The throstle singeth gay,\r\n      \"Youth is in the right of it,\r\n      And Age is in the wrong of it,\r\n        Whatever the world may say.\"\r\n\r\n  Ah, dearest, Doubt and Love are at strife,\r\n    And Love breathes hard and is nigh to death.\r\n  Their quarrel is old: shall it spoil our life?\r\n    Or shall we heed what the cold world saith?\r\n      Come forth into the wood,\r\n        And let us sing and say.\r\n      \"Love is in the right of it,\r\n      And Doubt is in the wrong of it,\r\n        And the world may go its way.\"\r\n\r\n  ROBERTSON TROWBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nDothegirls Hall.\r\n\r\nSuch was our name for it. But such was only our American name for an\r\nestablishment which in reality bore a much more imposing title. St.\r\nJohn's Priory was the name we were known by in the guide-books and to\r\nall the country round about. A noble Priory we were at our front, with\r\nheavy stone walls veiled in centuries-old ivy, and gables and finials\r\noutlined against the sky; and it was only at the rear, where were our\r\ndank court-yard, our wheezing pump, a dark vista into our dirty kitchen,\r\nand where often were strident Miss Betsy and Miss Sally, that we looked\r\nour deserving the name \"Dothegirls Hall.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in lovely Warwickshire, where green meadows sweep to the gentle\r\nAvon, which glides only a few miles away through Stratford and past\r\nShakespeare's home. Many of our countrypeople drove past the stately\r\nfront of our Priory every day, visiting, as all good Americans do,\r\nKenilworth Castle, with Amy Robsart's story in their hands, and\r\nCoventry, with Lady Godiva on their tongues and silk book-markers on\r\ntheir minds.\r\n\r\nOur brother and sister Yankees always gazed with admiration, not\r\nunmingled with awe, upon our Priory, and gushed over it to each other.\r\nFor not only is it one of the most picturesque objects of a famously\r\npicturesque Elizabethan town, but it has an added interest to Americans\r\nin having been mentioned in Hawthorne's \"Our Old Home.\"\r\n\r\nOur countrypeople gazed upon us with admiration, little dreaming the\r\ndark secrets we had discovered concerning that impressive pile, whose\r\npeaked roofs and soaring gables sheltered monk and prior before yet our\r\nown country had a name, and in whose cavernous cellars only the bravest\r\nof the servants dared to go, lest gowned and hooded spectres should ask\r\nwhat her business was.\r\n\r\nOf course to profane and worldly eyes these ghosts assumed the mean\r\nguise of empty boxes, decaying barrels and timbers, old kitchen-refuse,\r\nand such-like ghostly fowl. But there were spirits in mortal form among\r\nus imaginative enough to penetrate this sordid masquerade and to know\r\nthat subterraneanly we were haunted by goblins damned, if ever a priory\r\nwas since goblins and priories were invented. Our servants could not\r\ndisbelieve in our delightful ghosts, we _would_ not: hence we found our\r\nPriory as stimulative to the historic, poetic, and supernatural\r\nimagination as it was shocking to our moral sense and inflammatory to\r\nour tempers.\r\n\r\nBut these last two effects resulted from a _rear_ knowledge of St.\r\nJohn's; our _front_ view was always worthy of picture and poem, having\r\nwide portals, over which was the date of their last repair in 1622,\r\nhumped Tudor gables, and mullioned windows set with diamond panes.\r\n\r\nSt. John's belongs to a noble earl, whose castle overhangs the Avon only\r\na stone's throw away. As is so often the case in England, it has been\r\noccupied by the same family for more than a hundred years, the family\r\nnever owning stick or stone of it, but paying regular rent, as if here\r\nto-day and gone to-morrow, like the tenants of a city flat. The\r\ngrandfather of the present occupants brought his bride here and here\r\nraised a numerous family. Of that family no representatives now live\r\nsave two grand-daughters, the shrill and strident spinsters who made us\r\nso often forego our more impressive title to call ourselves after the\r\nflourishing institution made immortal by the deathless Squeers.\r\n\r\nIt is confidently asserted in England, and by those who really think\r\nthey know whereof they speak, that although such torture-houses as\r\nDotheboys Hall certainly did exist, even so lately as Dickens wrote, the\r\npublication of \"Nicholas Nickleby,\" by turning attention upon the abuse,\r\neffectually swept it out of English civilization. We \"smile bitterly,\"\r\nas romance people do, whenever we hear this assertion. For were we not\r\nourselves inmates of Dothegirls Hall not very long ago, and do we not\r\npositively know, without perhaps or peradventure, that it lives and\r\nthrives and tortures yet, at the very instant of this writing?\r\n\r\nMiss Sally kept a boarding-school and Miss Betsy took lodgers in the\r\nwide chambers of St. John's. We were among the lodgers, and our\r\ndining-room overlooked the gorse-golden meadows and the Avon, one\r\nside-window, however, commanding the court-yard of the house. Our way\r\nout of doors from our rooms led past the \"dormitory\" of the school and\r\ndown-stairs through the \"refectory.\" Thus we had ample opportunity for\r\nobservation and to embitter our souls with knowledge of the interior\r\nlife of English Dothegirls Halls.\r\n\r\nThe \"school\" occupied four rooms,--dining-room, school-room, and two\r\nbedrooms, the boys' dormitory and the girls'. The interior of the boys'\r\nroom we never saw, but the girls' we have surreptitiously stolen into,\r\nand a more wretched, dingy, comfortless place it would be difficult to\r\nimagine. All the girls--and there were ten or twelve of them--slept in\r\nthis limited space; they made their toilets, with one single towel for\r\nthe whole school, at the groaning pump beneath our window, and they\r\nlooked miserable and forlorn wherever we saw them, whether waiting upon\r\nus as servants at our table or staring up anxiously from the court below\r\nwaiting the shaking of our table-cloth and the possible crusts that\r\nmight fall therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe school-room also chanced to be just beneath, and all through\r\nschool-hours of the long summer days we heard the shrill scoldings and\r\nvicious threats with which Miss Sally fulfilled her mission.\r\n\r\n\"What ever is a noun?\" came floating into our ivied windows a dozen\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\n\"A noun's a-a-a--a noun's a-a-a--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go to the dormitory, you good-for-nothing, and find out on dry bread\r\nthat a noun's a name of anything, like helefunt, hantelope, heagle,\r\n'and, 'eart, ighway.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Sally, with furtive eyes and sly movements, always reminded us by\r\nher speech of the _ci-devant_ butcher we once saw in London, who assured\r\nus he was \"heducated at Hoxford.\"\r\n\r\nThe refectory had a sunken stone floor, and bare walls enclosing space\r\nenough to feed a hundred monks. It was principally used for drying\r\nclothes in wet weather and for storage of trunks and rough objects. At\r\none end, where were fewest signs of volcanic upheaval or the passing of\r\ncenturies of busy feet, stood always the table at which the pupils took\r\ntheir scanty fare. No white cloth ever covered this banqueting-board. In\r\nthe daytime it was draped in a coarse green baize spotted with ink and\r\ngrease. The pupils feasted upon this cloth, each with coarse mug and\r\nplate; at night it was removed to serve as cover for one of the beds!\r\nOnce upon a time came an unexpected cold snap in the very heart of the\r\nsoft Warwickshire summer. The sheets and blankets upon our beds, as also\r\nthe silver and linen of our private table, were all marked with the\r\npupils' names,--the school prospectus announcing that both linen and\r\nsilver must come with each pupil. The supply of blankets, however,\r\nproved insufficient for such unseasonable weather, and, like Oliver\r\nTwist, we asked for \"more.\"\r\n\r\n\"More\" came.\r\n\r\nAnd what, think you, was that \"more\"?\r\n\r\nNothing more nor less than that self-same inky and buttery baize, which\r\nwe indignantly rejected, equally for our own sake as for the sake of\r\nthose hapless girls shivering in their defrauded bed that we might be\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\nAt Dothegirls Hall pupils were \"taken in and done for,\" fed, lodged,\r\ntaught, for twenty pounds--or _one hundred dollars_--a year. The luxury\r\nof bare comfort could scarcely be expected for that price. Yet Miss\r\nSally must have made profit out of her starvelings, or Dothegirls Hall\r\nwould not have existed. We always observed that a certain punishment was\r\nthe usual one for every offence that children are likely to commit.\r\nAlmost never a day that we did not hear low moanings from one or both of\r\nthe dormitories, and thus knew that one, sometimes two or three, were\r\nincarcerated there \"on dry bread\" for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nOnce we questioned a victim, our interrogation-points assuming the shape\r\nof huge wedges of bread and jam.\r\n\r\n\"We are sent here on dry bread for missing our lessons, for having our\r\nshoes untied, for saying 'Yes' instead of 'Yes, Miss Sally,' for\r\neverything we do. I am sometimes three days of the week on dry bread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you write to your papa?\" blurted a young American of wrathful\r\nturkey-cock aspect.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I never had any papa,\" answered the poor child simply, \"and I don't\r\nknow where mamma lives.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! this innocent remark expressed volumes. We knew that most of the\r\npoor creatures \"had no papa and didn't know where mamma lived,\" that\r\nthey were mere jetsam and flotsam thrown up on this quiet shore from the\r\nwaves of the great ocean of London and forgotten by all the world save\r\nthose whose business it was to pay and to receive the twenty pounds a\r\nyear which was their sole importance.\r\n\r\nOf course the best of St. John's belonged to the lodgers, and the best\r\nwas delightful to tastes that prefer picturesqueness with moderate\r\ncomfort to smug and dapper luxury. Miss Betsy did our cooking, the\r\nschool-girls waited upon our table, the boys blacked our boots,\r\n\"Mam'zel,\" the French governess from Kilkenny, made our beds when there\r\nwas no servant, as often happened, birds nested in the ivy of our\r\nlatticed windows, bees floated up from the fragrant meadows below to hum\r\nus to our afternoon naps, and our table-cloth we shook every day\r\nourselves, having a deep purpose in refusing to allow it to be shaken by\r\nother hands.\r\n\r\nIt somehow always happened that the children's recess coincided with\r\nthat white fluttering from our diamonded window.\r\n\r\nOne day, when we first came to St. John's, we heard two quiet whispers\r\nat the ivy's roots:\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes um shakes out bread-'n'-butter.\"\r\n\r\n\"'N' sometimes um shakes out _tart_!\"\r\n\r\n\"O-o-o!\" answered the first whisper. \"_Tart?_ Truly _tart_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bet yer heye! One day I hadn't had nothink to heat all day, an' I was\r\na-'idin' 'ere, 'cos Miss Sally howed me a trouncin'. I were just\r\na-starvin'; an' I said to myself, 'Good Lord, don't I jest wish I had\r\na-somethin' to heat!' Jest then, bang came a great piece o' goose-berry\r\ntart right on to my 'ead!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Tart!_\" murmured the first whisper, in utter amazement. \"_Tart!_ Do ye\r\ns'pose we could get some more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see.\"\r\n\r\nThen we conspirators above heard thick-toned mumble among the leaves,--\r\n\r\n  \"Wishy, wishy, wishy wee,\r\n  Wishy send some tart to me.\"\r\n\r\nFat little American legs flashed to the pantry.\r\n\r\nFat little American legs flashed back again.\r\n\r\nNext instant came delighted cackle from among the ivy-roots:\r\n\r\n\"Blazes! Ef 'tain't _Tart an'_ CAKE!\"\r\n\r\nM. W. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Art of Modern Novel-Writing.\r\n\r\nOLD STYLE.\r\n\r\n\"Do you always choose such an early hour as this for your daily\r\nrambles?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not always,\" she said, \"but very often.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is it because the freshness of the morning tempts you out, or\r\nbecause you like to be alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather think it is because I like to be alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then for once you have failed of your object. But let me at least plead\r\nthat I have sinned in ignorance.\" And he held out his hand, with a\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW STYLE.\r\n\r\nHe watched her for a moment in silence, wondering curiously whether the\r\nfaint increase of color in her face was due to his unexpected\r\nappearance. When he spoke at last, there was a certain constraint in\r\nvoice and manner, as though back of his apparent cordiality there lurked\r\nsundry misgivings as to the wisdom of his present course, and a sense of\r\nirritation at the failure of his own nature to grasp completely the\r\nsubtile organization of his companion. \"Do you always choose such an\r\nearly hour as this for your daily rambles?\" he asked, studying with a\r\nhalf-tender scrutiny the irregular, sensitive face before him.\r\n\r\nThe girl faltered, and raised her eyes to meet his glance. They were\r\nstrange, light eyes,--not beautiful, but very rare in their peculiar\r\ntint of green-gray glass. They looked straight before them, brilliant\r\nand baffling. \"Not always,\" she said, with lingering emphasis, \"but very\r\noften.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was clear and sweet, though it lacked the cultivated\r\nmodulations of other tones he knew and loved. There was something in its\r\ncadences that recalled to him the flute-notes of the English\r\nwhite-throat, a melody that attracts only to disappoint. He smiled\r\nsoftly at her transparent reticence, and followed up his question. \"Is\r\nit because the freshness of the morning tempts you out?\" he said.\r\n\"Or\"--dropping his voice with sudden meaning--\"is it because you like to\r\nbe alone?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated, as though seeking some form of words that would\r\nnegatively express what was passing in her mind, yet not give her\r\nthoughts too clear a reading. There was a touch both of defiance and of\r\nexpectation in the quick turn of her head and the gleam of her half-shut\r\neyes. \"I rather think it is because I like to be alone,\" she said, at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nHe bowed slightly, and his face, accustomed to alter its expression with\r\nfacile ease, assumed a look of well-bred regret, tempered with the\r\nfaintest tinge of amusement. \"Then for once you have failed of your\r\nobject,\" he whispered apologetically. \"But let me at least plead\"--here\r\nthe amused expression deepened, and a gleam of malice brightened his\r\nkeen eyes--\"let me at least plead that I have sinned in ignorance.\"\r\n\r\nA.

The Experiences of a Hunter and\r\n     Naturalist in India, Ceylon, the Malay Peninsula, and Borneo.\" By\r\n     William T. Hornaday. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons.\r\n\r\nThe author of this book, who is now chief taxidermist of the National\r\nMuseum, was sent out in 1876 to the countries enumerated on the\r\ntitle-page as collector for Professor Ward's \"Natural Science\r\nEstablishment\" at Rochester. His skill and deftness in preparing skins\r\nand skeletons for mounting were, as we are led to suppose, what\r\nspecially qualified him for this mission; but if he had not possessed,\r\nin addition, many characteristics less common, perhaps, but more\r\ngenerally attractive, he could hardly have executed it with the same\r\nfacility and completeness, still less have found in it matter for this\r\nthoroughly entertaining narrative. His ardor as a sportsman and a\r\nnaturalist seems to have sprung from a stronger, independent love of\r\n\"wild life,\" an instinctive preference for the haunts and habits of\r\nuncivilized races, apart from the pursuits for which they give scope.\r\nThis may be thought to argue ignoble tastes; but the reverse conclusion\r\nwould be more correct. Mr. Hornaday is a believer in the \"gentle\r\nsavage.\" The Dyak seems to him \"the model man,\" not on account of his\r\ndefects, which are few, but of his virtues, which are many. He is manly,\r\ntruthful, honest, chaste, and even when drunk--which happens only on\r\nrare festive occasions and is a result of his intercourse with \"the\r\nrascally Chinaman\"--is perfectly decorous, and, as our author was\r\nassured, would never \"dream of violating the laws of decency and good\r\ntemper.\" For the Hindu, on the other hand, as an entirely conventional\r\nand artificial creature, obsequious, hypocritical, inhospitable,\r\ndisdainful of the race on whom he fawns and before whom he trembles as\r\n\"unclean,\" Mr. Hornaday has no other feeling than aversion and contempt.\r\nHe gives an amusing account of his indignation on finding that a vessel\r\nfrom which he had drunk was regarded by a \"ghee-seller\" as \"defiled.\" \"I\r\nwas strongly tempted,\" he writes, \"to knock his ghee-pots about his\r\nears, take thirty rupees' worth of satisfaction out of his royal\r\nhighness, and then go up to court and pay my fine.\" It will be seen that\r\nMr. Hornaday is a true-born American, and not disposed to stand any\r\nnonsense that conflicts with the great law of human equality. But though\r\nthis trait makes him appear somewhat uncharitable toward prejudices that\r\nhave survived the Declaration of Independence, it shows itself in its\r\nmost amiable light in his own free and sociable disposition, his\r\nreadiness to be on terms of good-fellowship with men of all sorts and\r\nconditions, and his heartiness in responding to any show of friendship\r\nin act or demeanor. Hence, on one occasion, even a Hindu, a\r\nfellow-traveller in a railway-carriage, roused his kindliest sentiments\r\nby offering him a handful of cooked \"dal\" after plastering it over a\r\nlittle pile of \"chapatties.\" \"I was completely taken aback for an\r\ninstant, for the old gentleman's hands were as grimy as my own; but I\r\naccepted the food with my politest bow and ate it down with every\r\nappearance of gratitude. I would have eaten it had it been ten times as\r\ndirty as it undoubtedly was. It was an act as friendly as any man could\r\nperform, and I was pleased to find such a feeling of pure charity and\r\nbenevolence in a native.\" Nor does his nationality prevent him from\r\ndoing justice to the English character as it came under his observation\r\nin the East. He recognizes the benevolence of the English rule in India,\r\nand considers Sarawak under Rajah Brooke \"the model of a good\r\ngovernment.\" With individual Englishmen--who, he considers, are seen to\r\nthe best advantage out of their own country--he found no difficulty in\r\nforming the most cordial relations. We have no doubt that his own\r\nqualities, his good humor, frankness, intelligence, and vivacity,\r\ncoupled with his enthusiasm for pursuits in which almost all Englishmen\r\ntake a strong interest, rendered him a very attractive and agreeable\r\ncompanion, and caused the \"Britishers\" with whom he came in contact to\r\nset him down at once for what he evidently is, an uncommonly good\r\nspecimen of the Yankee.\r\n\r\nMr. Hornaday has the good sense to spare us the tedium of reading any\r\nfresh descriptions of regions and places sufficiently well known or only\r\ncasually visited in the course of his travels. The few and slight\r\nexceptions prove, indeed, that he would hardly be a safe guide when off\r\nhis own ground. His criticism of the Taj Mahal, than which \"no other\r\nstructure in the world has been so greatly overpraised,\" may be accepted\r\nas an instance of an independent impression and an offset to the\r\nextravagance of some of its admirers, but will scarcely testify to his\r\ncompetency to pass judgment on works of art in the tone of a recognized\r\nauthority. Nor does his notion that Cairo was the capital of ancient\r\nEgypt, that \"we may take pleasure in thinking that the city is to-day\r\nvery like what it was when the Pyramids were new,\" (!) and \"believe that\r\nthese are the same cramped and crooked streets, the same latticed\r\nwindows and overhanging upper stories, the same bazaars and workshops\r\nand wells, that were here when the brethren of Joseph came down, as\r\nenvoys extraordinary, to practise the arts of diplomacy in the court of\r\nPharaoh,\" suggest any profound acquaintance with the history of the\r\ncountry and the mutations it has undergone. But it would be very unfair\r\nto dwell on such points as these. In general, as has been intimated, Mr.\r\nHornaday sticks to his last with a rare and commendable closeness. The\r\nsights which he finds most attractive in famous seaports are the\r\nfish-markets and the natural-history museums. The themes on which he\r\nloves to dilate are the habits of the crocodile, the elephant, and the\r\norang-utan, the modes of hunting and killing them, and, above all, the\r\nprocess of skinning and dissecting them. But he does not delight in\r\nslaughter for the sake of sport, nor regard the forest or the river as\r\nsimply the habitat of uncouth monsters, nor make the account of his\r\njourneys the record of a mere business enterprise. He has a keen love of\r\nadventure, a strong sense of the humorous aspect of his experiences, and\r\nan inexhaustible flow of spirits. He writes in an animated but\r\nunpretentious style, and without any attempt at elaborate description\r\ncontrives to leave clear impressions of his achievements and\r\nsurroundings. His ardor and good spirits are infectious, and the reader\r\nis as little wearied as he himself appears to have been by his long and\r\ndevious tramps over the hills, through the swamps, and amid the tangled\r\nundergrowth of the jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks on Artists.\r\n\r\n     \"Life and Reminiscences of Gustave Dore\". Compiled from Material\r\n     supplied by Dore's Relations and Friends and from Personal\r\n     Recollection. With many Original Unpublished Sketches and\r\n     Selections from Dore's best Published Illustrations. By Blanche\r\n     Roosevelt.

(Bibliotheque d'Art Moderne.) Paris: Jules Ronam.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roosevelt's volume is an engaging jumble of fact and fancy, a\r\nmedley of impressions, hasty generalizations, souvenirs, reminiscences,\r\nall jotted down apparently in such breathless haste that we can only\r\nwonder that the result is a coherent and tolerably serious study of\r\nGustave Dore, his life and his works. The author's methods are, indeed,\r\nthose of the great designer himself, who obtained brilliant results\r\nregardless of careful processes. A genuine biography of Dore is yet to\r\nbe written; but here we have a rather fascinating book of five hundred\r\npages, full of personal and intimate narrations by the artist's family\r\nand friends, profuse, _naif_, tender, overflowing with French sentiment\r\nand an intense sympathy and _camaraderie_. Interspersed with this\r\nbiographical matter are innumerable pen-and-ink sketches, caricatures,\r\ndesigns, and finished pictures, illustrating the natural evolution of\r\nDore's marvellous talent, the first instances of which show what he\r\ncould do at the age of five. In fact, long before he could read the\r\nchild showed clear signs of possessing a distinctively artistic\r\norganization. His practice with pen and pencil was pursued, however,\r\nwithout any sympathy or encouragement from his family, and his father,\r\nat least, was strongly averse to his taking up the career of an artist.\r\nIn 1847, when Gustave was in his fifteenth year, his parents, who\r\nresided at Strasbourg, took him for a fortnight to Paris. The delights\r\nof the capital made a strong impression on the mind of the stripling,\r\nand he ardently wished to remain there. The thought occurred to him of\r\noffering some of his work to publishers, and, dashing off a few\r\ncaricatures, he took advantage of the momentary absence of his parents\r\nto show them to Philipon, who had just founded his \"Journal pour Rire.\"\r\nThe result was that the publisher instantly engaged Gustave as one of\r\nthe regular artists for his paper, and the boy remained in Paris,\r\nsupporting himself and paying for his tuition at the Lycee Charlemagne,\r\nwhere he had Taine and About for fellow-collegians. This early success,\r\ncombined with the most untiring industry and steady, almost passionate,\r\ndevotion to his work, is one of the most remarkable biographical facts\r\non record. A year later the elder Dore died, and his widow came to Paris\r\nto reside with her two sons, the chief expenses of the _menage_ being\r\nsupported by Gustave, then little more than sixteen years of age.\r\nBetween the years 1850 and 1870 he is said to have made by his pencil\r\nseven millions of francs,--almost a million and a half of dollars.\r\nBesides this enormous activity, a supreme and jealous ambition induced\r\nhim to undertake not only every piece of work offered, from\r\nBible-illustrations to a comic almanac, but whatever his brain or his\r\nfancy could conceive as possible for artist to achieve. Inspiration\r\nseized him at each new idea, bold and striking images, fantastic\r\nfancies, all the splendors of a magnificent or grotesque ideal. His work\r\nwas a delirium; in a single morning he has been known to throw off\r\ntwenty blocks which brought him ten thousand francs. He was, however,\r\nperpetually discontented, disgusted with his vocation, and envious of\r\nsuccessful painters. He had almost a convulsion one day on hearing that\r\nMeissonier had received two hundred thousand francs for a single\r\npainting. \"What!\" he exclaimed; \"a thing like that? Now, look at me. I\r\ncan paint; I know I could paint better than Meissonier, at any rate.\r\nHave I ever been paid two hundred thousand francs for anything? No; and\r\nI never shall be. The fact is that no one understands me. I shall live\r\nand die misunderstood, or never comprehended at all,--which is worse.\"\r\nFired by emulation, he shut himself up to create masterpieces which\r\nshould surpass Meissonier and paralyze the world; and in a short time he\r\nshowed his friend Lacroix twelve colossal canvases on which he had\r\npainted revolting realistic pictures which he called the \"Abominations\r\nof Paris.\" \"What do you think of Meissonier now?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHe longed ardently to be a painter, and was never at peace with critical\r\nParis while it refused him the name of painter and called him only a\r\ndesigner. London was dearer to his heart from the fact that there were\r\nenshrined in the Dore Gallery and made one of the sights of the town his\r\nstupendous canvases imaging forth his conceptions of Scripture subjects.\r\nWhat he might have done as a painter had he studied at any early age\r\nunder good masters must be left to conjecture, although his paintings\r\ncarry with them a clear confession that naturally he did not possess a\r\ngood eye for color. He was always impatient of criticism which made him\r\nfeel that there was any lack of _technique_ in his works. \"He has it all\r\nin him, but lacks 'school,'\" was the verdict of the critics.\r\nUndoubtedly, wishing to do all that man has done, Dore would have liked\r\nto focus his powers on marvels of refinement and exactness, like\r\nMeissonier's; but he was proud of his distinctive characteristics, and\r\nwanted the least block he touched to show something Doreish.\r\n\r\n\"Now you will give us some Velasquezes,\" a lady said to him during his\r\njourney in Spain.\r\n\r\n\"No, madame,\" he replied; \"I shall give you some more 'Dores.'\"\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoyed was an audacious and gigantic experiment, a subject\r\nwhich allowed him free and bold handling and a mystic, half-grotesque\r\nattitude toward what he found in it of poetry or strength. The feverish\r\nand hurried character of his work is sadly evident in many of his most\r\nambitious designs. His illustrations of Milton, Dante, and the Wandering\r\nJew may be said to show his powers at their best,--and perhaps we ought\r\nto include his Bible-pictures. Too often he uses without apparent motive\r\nfeeble allegory and fantasy; and many of his later works must be\r\nconsidered by his most charitable critics not only obscure, but almost\r\ninsane.\r\n\r\nTo turn from Dore to Delacroix is to take up the very different career\r\nof one of those \"immortals\" among whose works the great designer was\r\neager to see his own unlucky paintings enrolled. Opposite as these two\r\nartists were, they had nevertheless certain things in common: their work\r\nwas their life,--all personal gratification was subordinated to\r\nart,--each denied himself marriage, and yet enjoyed the untiring\r\ndevotion of some sort of womankind. Dore had both his mother and his\r\nnurse to humor and spoil him. Delacroix endured the affectionate tyranny\r\nof his housekeeper, who watched over him as a lioness over her young.\r\nDelacroix, who was frail, sensitive, feverishly carried away by his\r\nwork, needed just the careful intervention which this woman imposed to\r\nsave him from the depressing influences of every-day life. She kept all\r\nuncongenial visitors from him. He was fastidious to a degree,--could not\r\nuse a spoiled palette, and Jenny learned to prepare his palette, colors,\r\nand brushes with the nicest care. Delacroix began with a masterpiece. He\r\nwas only twenty-three when he produced his \"Dante and Virgil,\" which put\r\nhim at the head of the so-called \"romantic school.\" His clear intellect,\r\nhis strength as a draughtsman, his abundance of invention, his wonderful\r\ncolor, made themselves felt at once. He had a long career in which to\r\ndevelop, and he was tireless in reinforcing his own great powers by\r\nprofound and careful study of great authors, besides working\r\nperpetually to discover the secrets of the splendid paintings of\r\nRaphael, Velasquez, Veronese, and, above all, Rubens. It was his habit\r\nto spend whole days at the Jardin des Plantes, watching the animals,\r\nobserving their postures and movements, aiming to pluck the heart out of\r\nthe mystery of each organization. In 1828 he went to England, and,\r\nalthough he disliked the country, its architecture, the ill-made shoes\r\nand soiled stockings of the women, he carried back with him powerful\r\nimpressions from Constable and from Kean's impersonations of Shakespeare\r\nwhich animated all his later work. His picture of \"Hamlet,\" although it\r\nwas not completed until 1843, owes its conception to this period. His\r\nlithographs of \"Faust\" elicited from Goethe the remark, \"He has\r\nsurpassed the pictures I had made for myself of the scenes written by\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nThe carefully-prepared monographs on Millet and Holbein, accompanied by\r\nexcellent designs after their works, are full of suggestive criticism,\r\nand show how well the modern practice of popularizing art is carried on\r\nin Paris. Millet was born some sixteen years after Delacroix, and came\r\nto Paris in 1837, when that great master had produced some of his best\r\npictures, which of all contemporary art were what aroused Millet's\r\nadmiration and homage. \"_Grands par les gestes_,\" he called them,\r\n\"_grands par l'invention et la richesse du coloris_.\" Millet himself,\r\nhowever, was to found a separate school from that of the brilliant\r\nDelacroix. The fac-similes in this brochure from his original designs in\r\ncrayon or pastel give much of the sentiment and meaning of his work. As\r\nthe author says, they might well be the illustrations of a mighty poem\r\ncalled \"The Earth.\" Night and morning, sunrise, noon, and sunset, the\r\nsuccession of seasons, the patient industries of the workers who toil\r\nlike nature's own forces, simply, sternly, and with silent strength, all\r\ntell their story here. Millet had passed his youth in the fields, and,\r\nthe son of a peasant, he must himself have been the central figure in\r\nmany such scenes as those with which he has charmed the world. His\r\npicture of \"The Haricot-Gatherer\" represents the paternal cottage, and\r\nthe figure of the woman in the garden is that of his mother herself.\r\nWhen he enshrined personal memories like these, no wonder we find in\r\nMillet's work the interpretation of so much that is deepest and most\r\nintimate in the history of man.\r\n\r\nThe gallery of the portraits of Hans Holbein the younger is well chosen,\r\nand gives some excellent instances of the artist's unsurpassed manner.\r\nThere is inevitably something in any picture of Holbein's which holds\r\nthe attention by its absolute reality: it is not only natural, but true,\r\nthe reflection of an actual personality. An interest attaches to the\r\nportrait of Anne of Cleves, although one hardly finds in it the beauty\r\nwhich misled Henry VIII. and altered the history of England a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive Novels.\r\n\r\n     \"A Wheel of Fire.\" By Arlo Bates. New York: Charles Scribner's\r\n     Sons.\r\n\r\n     \"As it was Written: A Jewish Musician's Story.\" By Sidney Luska.\r\n     New York: Cassell & Co.\r\n\r\n     \"Love--or a Name.\" By Julian Hawthorne.

B.\r\n     Lippincott Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Arlo Bates's novel \"A Wheel of Fire\" shows such skilful\r\nconstruction, is so nicely balanced in its parts, while its literary\r\nexecution is so far above the common, that we can only wish the author\r\nhad expended such faithful and conscientious work upon a plot less\r\nhopelessly dreary than one must be which hinges upon the problem of\r\nhereditary insanity. Every other human infirmity may be rounded off,\r\nmerged into a lofty ideal of acceptance, renunciation, and expiation.\r\nBut under no imaginable conditions can madness be regarded as something\r\nfrom which the heart and soul of man does not shudderingly recoil.\r\nAccordingly, a heroine who is haunted, beset, and finally driven crazy\r\nby the dread of the fatal inheritance being in her blood seems set apart\r\nfrom the fluctuations and hesitations of maidenly passion. There is\r\nsomething unhealthy, eerie, in the story Mr. Bates has made and in the\r\nsituation he has chosen.\r\n\r\nDamaris Wainwright's mother has died insane, her brother is a hopeless\r\nlunatic,--in fact, he commits suicide in the early part of the\r\nstory,--and she has accepted the conditions fate seems to have imposed,\r\nand has renounced all idea of marriage, when the nephew of her family\r\nlawyer falls in love with her and shows an indomitable resolution to win\r\nher for his wife. The old story of \"_femme qui ecoute_\" follows.\r\nDamaris is swayed partly by his influence, partly by her own impulses,\r\nand in great measure by the freely-expressed opinion of the specialist\r\nwho has had charge of her insane brother, that she is in no danger of\r\ninheriting her mother's malady. Unluckily for her, she half consents to\r\nengage herself to the lawyer. Had she wholly consented or wholly\r\nrefused, her doom might perhaps have been averted. We frankly consider\r\nher lover quite unequal to the situation. He imposed upon her long and\r\nlonely musings, sleepless nights and melancholy days, when he should\r\nhave given her the support of the strong will and powerful intellect\r\nwhich the author lays claim to for his hero. Agonizing over painful\r\ndoubts is not good for people whose intellects hover on the border-lands\r\nof nervous fantasy. Lincoln, if resolved to marry the unfortunate girl,\r\nshould have shown more Lochinvar-like haste. Instead, during the long\r\ninterval of waiting, Damaris is allowed to run the whole gamut of\r\npainful experiences, and, naturally, at the climax of the story, her\r\n\"fate cries out.\" Of course this is the author's intention; but we\r\ncannot help feeling that Miss Wainwright had hardly a fair chance. As an\r\noffset to the gloom and melancholy of their tragedy, there is a lively\r\nlove-affair between two young people who snatch a fearful joy in the\r\nmidst of as dreary an environment as can easily be imagined. Both Miss\r\nDimmont and Dr. Chauncey Wilson are life-like, although not engaging,\r\ncharacters, and the doctor, in particular, although we do not think\r\nhighly of his science, is a vigorous and consistent creation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the plot of \"As it was Written\" turns on the murder of the\r\nheroine, the book is yet a considerably livelier one than Mr. Bates's,\r\nand imposes no such burden of hopeless misery on the reader. A startling\r\nand mysterious crime is dear to the human imagination, and here we are\r\nconfronted with one hideous in its cruelty and inexplicable in its\r\ncircumstances. The story is told by the passionate lover of the murdered\r\nVeronika, and there is much youthful eloquence and pathos in the\r\ndescription of his meeting with the lovely young Jewess, their sympathy\r\nin art,--for both are musicians,--their ardent hopes and beliefs for\r\neach other. They are to be married in a fortnight, when the frightful\r\nact is interposed which transforms the whole aspect of the world for\r\nthe young man. The reader must discover for himself the key to the\r\ntragedy. The book is one of those which the phenomenal success of\r\n\"Called Back\" summoned into existence. That clearly proved that the\r\npublic loved a mystery and a sensational _denouement_, and ever since\r\nthe annals of crime have been rummaged for horrors. But \"As it was\r\nWritten\" has an advantage over other works of its class in a certain\r\ncharm and freshness, not only from its Jewish setting, but from the\r\nfervid youthful feeling which gives a pleasing and natural touch to the\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nWarren Bell, the hero of Mr. Julian Hawthorne's \"Love--or a Name,\" finds\r\nhimself, at first presentation, on his way to offer marriage to Miss\r\nNell Anthony, who has just been left motherless, and to whom he feels\r\nthat he owes this manly tribute. He acquits his conscience of this duty,\r\nbut performs it nevertheless in such a jerky, unlover-like fashion that\r\nfew young women, certainly not one of Miss Anthony's force of character,\r\ncould have been imposed upon. \"I thought you l-loved me,\" said he. Which\r\nsurely is not the way to win a fair lady. Much to his comfort, as well\r\nas to his ingenuous surprise, he is refused, and goes back to New York,\r\nhaving renounced \"Love\" and decided to care only for a \"Name.\" Mr.\r\nHawthorne seems to have made an effort to work into the story of his\r\nhero a faithful account of New York \"ring\"-management and official\r\ncorruption. Warren Bell finds a patron in Mr. Drayton, who has all sorts\r\nof ambitious schemes to further, and offers his committees and his\r\nconfederates a \"big game\" in the way of \"water-works\" stocks, and the\r\nlike. These pictures of corrupt judges and dishonest corporations have\r\nsome probability: they show us many clearly-developed sensual and\r\nmercenary scoundrels; they are all, very possibly, portraits from life;\r\nbut they are all excessively crude in their likenesses and inexpressibly\r\nwearisome. It is a distasteful and unsavory world to which the author\r\nintroduces us: if he wishes to show us consummate rascals we insist that\r\nhe should wrap them in some veil of decency, if not of art, and not fill\r\nhis pages with incidents and talk which properly belong to the\r\npolice-court. Mr. Hawthorne finally rescues his hero from the ignoble\r\nset from whom he has luckily escaped winning a very bad name, and makes\r\nhim seek his happiness instead in love, which Miss Anthony obligingly\r\nconsents to give him. The other characters mostly expiate their crimes\r\nand misdemeanors in a succession of tragic and unpleasant incidents, and\r\none closes the book with annoyance that so raw, tentative, and\r\nunpleasant a story should have been forced upon one's attention by its\r\nbearing the signature of a writer who can do so much better.\r\n\r\n\"A Social Experiment\" treats of the experiences of a pretty mill-girl,\r\nthe daughter of a washerwoman, who becomes the _protegee_ of a wealthy\r\nand capricious woman of the world, who educates her, introduces her to\r\nsociety, then finally drops her and permits her to seek her native\r\nobscurity, where she withers and dies of a broken heart. The story is\r\nvery well told, but with a good deal of needless discussion as to the\r\nright or wrong of the experiment. The heroine has complicated matters by\r\na secret marriage to a man in her own rank of life, which later becomes\r\ndistasteful to her, and the duties of which she refuses to fulfil. Like\r\nthe three preceding novels in our list, \"A Social Experiment\" is rather\r\ndoleful, and seems to have been written for any other purpose rather\r\nthan to cheer and stimulate the average reader who longs for pictures of\r\nlife which rouse pleasant fancies and kindle tender sentiments. None of\r\nthese books are in the least degree commonplace, but, by excluding what\r\nis chiefly dear and precious to the heart and mind of common humanity,\r\nthey exclude many of the qualities which achieve success for a novel.\r\n\r\nIn \"For Lilias,\" on the other hand, the author avails herself of all the\r\nagreeable traditions of English fiction: there are warm and well-lighted\r\nrooms, well-to-do people, regular meals, afternoon tea, plenty of\r\nbread-and-butter, and a gentle ripple of friendly, soft-voiced\r\nconversation. This may not be original or exciting, but, after a good\r\ndeal of crude sensation through some thousand and odd pages, \"ways of\r\npleasantness and paths of peace\" are refreshing to the critic, who\r\nbelieves that although the novelist should not sacrifice his meaning to\r\nthe requisitions of mere agreeableness, out of regard for art and the\r\ntaste of his readers, he should still have beauty in some degree or\r\nother as his chief end in view.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] So I had written, led to agree with the anthropologists who\r\nhold this view, by my own observations among the Indians of every State\r\nand Territory in our West: the more I have seen and read of the\r\nwidely-spread native races belonging to various linguistic stocks, the\r\nmore their similitude has been pressed upon my attention. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is another opinion, as appears in a recent letter from Professor\r\nPutnam, to whom I had quoted the sentence above. \"All had certain\r\nfeatures in common,\" he says; \"they were red-skinned Americans in the\r\ngeneral sense of the term, although some were more olive than red, and\r\nothers were darker-skinned than red. Mr. Carr, no doubt, would accept\r\nyour statement that they were all 'tarred with one stick,' but he judges\r\nfrom _history_. For my part, I feel confident that there were several\r\nstocks of the great Mongolian race in America; and there is also some\r\nevidence (facts are accumulating) of a migration across the Atlantic.
