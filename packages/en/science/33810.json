For\r\nafter we had, in order finally to learn the true substance of the globe,\r\nseen and thoroughly examined many of those things which have been obtained\r\nfrom mountain heights or ocean depths, or from the profoundest caverns and\r\nfrom hidden mines: we applied much prolonged labour on investigating the\r\nmagnetical forces; so wonderful indeed are they, compared with the forces\r\nof all other minerals, surpassing even the virtues of all other bodies\r\nabout us. Nor have we found this our labour idle or unfruitful; since daily\r\nduring our experimenting, new and unexpected properties came to light; and\r\nour Philosophy hath grown so much from the things diligently observed, that\r\nwe have attempted to expound the interior parts of the terrene globe, and\r\nits native substance, upon magnetick principles; and to reveal to men the\r\nearth (our common mother), and to point it out as if with the finger, by\r\nreal demonstrations and by experiments manifestly apparent to the senses.\r\nAnd as geometry ascends from sundry very small and very easy principles to\r\nthe greatest and most difficult; by which the wit of man climbs above the\r\nfirmament: so our magnetical doctrine and science first sets forth in\r\nconvenient order the things which are less obscure; from these there come\r\nto light others that are more remarkable; and at length in due order there\r\nare opened the concealed and most secret things of the globe of the earth,\r\nand the causes are made known of those things which, either through the\r\nignorance of the ancients or the neglect of moderns, have remained\r\nunrecognized and overlooked. But why should I, in so vast an Ocean of Books\r\nby which the minds of studious men are troubled and fatigued, through which\r\nvery foolish productions the world and unreasoning men are intoxicated, and\r\npuffed up, rave and create literary broils, and while professing to be\r\nphilosophers, physicians, mathematicians and astrologers, neglect and\r\ndespise men of learning: why should I, I say, add aught further to this\r\nso-perturbed republick of letters, and expose this noble philosophy, which\r\nseems new and incredible by reason of so many things hitherto unrevealed,\r\nto be damned and torn to pieces by the maledictions of those who are either\r\nalready sworn to the opinions of other men, or are foolish corruptors of\r\ngood arts, learned idiots, grammatists, sophists, wranglers, and perverse\r\nlittle folk? But to you alone, true philosophizers, honest men, who seek\r\nknowledge not from books only but from things themselves, have I addressed\r\nthese magnetical principles in this new sort of Philosophizing. But if any\r\nsee not fit to assent to these self-same opinions and paradoxes, let them\r\nnevertheless mark the great array of experiments and discoveries (by which\r\nnotably every philosophy flourisheth), which have been wrought out and\r\ndemonstrated by us with many pains and vigils and expenses. In these\r\nrejoice, and employ them to better uses, if ye shall be able. I know how\r\narduous it is to give freshness to old things, lustre to the antiquated,\r\nlight to the dark, grace to the despised, credibility to the doubtful; so\r\nmuch the more by far is it difficult to win and establish some authority\r\nfor things new and unheard-of, in the face of all the opinions of all men.\r\nNor for that do we care, since philosophizing, as we deemed, is for the\r\nfew. To our own discoveries and experiments we have affixed asterisks,\r\nlarger and smaller, according to the importance and subtlety of the matter.\r\nWhoso desireth to make trial of the same experiments, let him handle the\r\nsubstances, not negligently and carelessly, but prudently, deftly, and in\r\nthe proper way; nor let him (when a thing doth not succeed) ignorantly\r\ndenounce our discoveries: for nothing hath been set down in these books\r\nwhich hath not been explored and many times performed and repeated amongst\r\nus. Many things in our reasonings and hypotheses will, perchance, at first\r\nsight, seem rather hard, when they are foreign to the {iij} commonly\r\nreceived opinion; yet I doubt not but that hereafter they will yet obtain\r\nauthority from the demonstrations themselves. Wherefore in magnetical\r\nscience, they who have made most progress, trust most in and profit most by\r\nthe hypotheses; nor will anything readily become certain to any one in a\r\nmagnetical philosophy in which all or at least most points are not\r\nascertained. This nature-knowledge is almost entirely new and unheard-of,\r\nsave what few matters a very few writers have handed down concerning\r\ncertain common magnetical powers. Wherefore we but seldom quote antient\r\nGreek authors in our support, because neither by using greek arguments nor\r\ngreek words can the truth be demonstrated or elucidated either more\r\nprecisely or more significantly. For our doctrine magnetical is at variance\r\nwith most of their principles and dogmas. Nor have we brought to this work\r\nany pretence of eloquence or adornments of words; but this only have we\r\ndone, that things difficult and unknown might be so handled by us, in such\r\na form of speech, and in such words as are needed to be clearly understood:\r\nSometimes therefore we use new and unusual words, not that by means of\r\nfoolish veils of vocabularies we should cover over the facts with shades\r\nand mists (as Alchemists are wont to do) but that hidden things which have\r\nno name, never having been hitherto perceived, may be plainly and correctly\r\nenunciated. After describing our magnetical experiments and our information\r\nof the homogenick parts of the earth, we proceed to the general nature of\r\nthe whole globe; wherein it is permitted us to philosophize freely and with\r\nthe same liberty which the Egyptians, Greeks, and Latins formerly used in\r\npublishing their dogmas: whereof very many errors have been handed down in\r\nturn to later authors: and in which smatterers still persist, and wander as\r\nthough in perpetual darkness. To those early forefathers of philosophy,\r\nAristotle, Theophrastus, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen, let due honour be\r\never paid: for by them wisdom hath been diffused to posterity; but our age\r\nhath detected and brought to light very many facts which they, were they\r\nnow alive, would gladly have accepted. Wherefore we also have not hesitated\r\nto expound in demonstrable hypotheses those things which we have discovered\r\nby long experience. Farewell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MOST EMINENT AND LEARNED MAN\r\n\r\nDR. WILLIAM GILBERT,\r\n\r\n_a distinguished Doctor of Medicine amongst the_\r\n\r\nLondoners, and Father of Magnetick Philosophy,\r\n\r\nan Encomiastic Preface of Edward Wright\r\n\r\non the subject of these books\r\n\r\n_Magnetical_.\r\n\r\n_Should there by chance be any one, most eminent Sir, who reckons as of\r\nsmall account these magnetical books and labours of yours, and thinks these\r\nstudies of yours of too little moment, and by no means worthy enough of the\r\nattention of an eminent man devoted to the weightier study of Medicine:\r\ntruly he must deservedly be judged to be in no common degree void of\r\nunderstanding. For that the use of the magnet is very important and wholly\r\nadmirable is better known for the most part to men of even the lowest class\r\nthan to need from me at this time any long address or commendation. Nor\r\ntruly in my judgment could you have chosen any topick either more noble or\r\nmore useful to the human race, upon which to exercise the strength of your\r\nphilosophic intellect; since indeed it has been brought about by the divine\r\nagency of this stone, that continents of such vast circuit, such an\r\ninfinite number of lands, islands, peoples, and tribes, which have remained\r\nunknown for so many ages, have now only a short time ago, almost within our\r\nown memory, been quite easily discovered and quite frequently explored, and\r\nthat the circuit of the whole terrestrial globe also has been more than\r\nonce circumnavigated by our own countrymen, Drake and Cavendish; a fact\r\nwhich I wish to mention to the lasting memory of these men. For by the\r\npointing of the iron touched by a loadstone, the points of South, North,\r\nEast, and West, and the other quarters of the world are made known to\r\nnavigators even under an overcast sky and in the darkest night; so that\r\nthus they always very easily understand to which point of the world they\r\nought to direct their ship's course; which before the discovery of this\r\nwonderful virtue of the magnetick [Greek: boreodeixis] was clearly\r\nimpossible. Hence in old times (as is established in histories), an\r\nincredible anxiety and immense danger was continually threatening sailors;\r\nfor at the coming on of a tempest and the obscuring of the view of sun and\r\nstars, they were left entirely in ignorance whither they were making; nor\r\ncould they find out this by any reasoning or skill. With what joy then may\r\nwe suppose them to have been filled, to what feelings of delight must all\r\nshipmasters have given utterance, when that index magnetical first offered\r\nitself to them as a most sure guide, and as it were a Mercury, for their\r\njourney? But neither was this sufficient for this magnetical Mercury; to\r\nindicate, namely, the right way, and to point, as it were, a finger in the\r\ndirection toward which the course must be {iiij} directed; it began also\r\nlong ago to show distinctly the distance of the place toward which it\r\npoints. For since the index magnetical does not always in every place look\r\ntoward the same point of the North, but deviates from it often, either\r\ntoward the East or toward the West, yet always has the same deviation in\r\nthe same place, whatever the place is, and steadily preserves it; it has\r\ncome about that from that deviation, which they call variation, carefully\r\nnoticed and observed in any maritime places, the same places could\r\nafterwards also be found by navigators from the drawing near and approach\r\nto the same variation as that of these same places, taken in conjunction\r\nwith the observation of the latitude. Thus the Portuguese in their voyages\r\nto the East Indies had the most certain indications of their approach to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope; as appears from the narrations of Hugo van\r\nLynschoten and of the very learned Richard Hakluyt, our countryman. Hence\r\nalso the experienced skippers of our own country, not a few of them, in\r\nmaking the voyage from the Gulf of Mexico to the islands of the Azores,\r\nrecognized that they had come as near as possible to these same islands;\r\nalthough from their sea-charts they seemed to be about six hundred British\r\nmiles from them. And so, by the help of this magnetick index, it would seem\r\nas though that geographical problem of finding the longitude, which for so\r\nmany centuries has exercised the intellects of the most learned\r\nMathematicians, were going to be in some way satisfied; because if the\r\nvariation for any maritime place whatever were known, the same place could\r\nvery readily be found afterward, as often as was required, from the same\r\nvariation, the latitude of the same place being not unknown._\r\n\r\n_It seems, however, that there has been some inconvenience and hindrance\r\nconnected with the observation of this variation; because it cannot be\r\nobserved excepting when the sun or the stars are shining. Accordingly this\r\nmagnetick Mercury of the sea goes on still further to bless all\r\nshipmasters, being much to be preferred to Neptune himself, and to all the\r\nsea-gods and goddesses; not only does it show the direction in a dark night\r\nand in thick weather, but it also seems to exhibit the most certain\r\nindications of the latitude. For an iron index, suspended on its axis (like\r\na pair of scales), with the most delicate workmanship so as to balance in\r\næquilibrio, and then touched and excited by a loadstone, dips to some fixed\r\nand definite point beneath the horizon (in our latitude in London, for\r\nexample, to about the seventy-second degree), at which it at length comes\r\nto rest. But under the æquator itself, from that admirable agreement and\r\ncongruency which, in almost all and singular magnetical experiments, exists\r\nbetween the earth itself and a terrella (that is, a globular loadstone), it\r\nseems exceedingly likely (to say the very least), and indeed more than\r\nprobable, that the same index (again stroked with a loadstone) will remain\r\nin æquilibrio in an horizontal position. Whence it is evident that this\r\nalso is very probable, that in an exceedingly small progress from the South\r\ntoward the North (or contrariwise) there will be at least a sufficiently\r\nperceptible change in that declination; so that from that declination in\r\nany place being once carefully observed along with the latitude, the same\r\nplace and the same latitude may be very easily recognized afterward, even\r\nin the darkest night and in the thickest mist by a declination instrument.\r\nWherefore to bring our oration at length back to you, most eminent and\r\nlearned Dr. Gilbert (whom I gladly recognize as my teacher in this\r\nmagnetick philosophy), if these books of yours on the Magnet had contained\r\nnothing else, excepting only this finding of latitude from magnetick\r\ndeclination, by you now first brought to light, our shipmasters, Britains,\r\nFrench, Belgians, and Danes, trying to enter the British Channel or the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar from the Atlantick Ocean in dark weather, would still\r\nmost deservedly judge them to be valued at no small sum of gold. But that\r\ndiscovery of yours about the whole globe of the earth being magnetical,\r\nalthough perchance it will seem to many \"most paradoxical,\" producing even\r\na feeling of astonishment, has yet been so firmly defended by you at all\r\npoints and confirmed by so many experiments so apposite and appropriate to\r\nthe matter in hand, in Bk. 2, chap. 34; Bk. 3, chap. 4 and 12; and in\r\nalmost the whole of the fifth book, that no room is left for doubt or\r\ncontradiction. I come therefore to the cause of the magnetick variation,\r\nwhich hitherto has distracted the minds of all the learned; for which no\r\nmortal has ever adduced a more probable reason than that which has now been\r\nset forth by you for the first time in these books of yours on the Magnet.\r\nThe [Greek: orthoboreodeixis] of the index magnetical in the middle of the\r\nocean, and in the middle of continents (or at least in the middle of their\r\nstronger and more lofty parts), its inclining near the shore toward those\r\nsame parts, even by sea and by land, agreeing with the experiments Bk. 4,\r\nchap. 2, on an actual terrella (made after the likeness of the terrestrial\r\nglobe, uneven, and rising up in certain parts, either weak or wanting in\r\nfirmness, or imperfect in some other way),--this inclination having been\r\nproved, very certainly demonstrates the probability that that variation is\r\nnought else than a certain deviation of the magnetick needle toward those\r\nparts of the earth that are more vigorous and more prominent. Whence the\r\nreason is readily established of that irregularity which is often perceived\r\nin the magnetick variations, arising from the inæquality and irregularity\r\nof those eminences and of the terrestrial forces. Nor of a surety have I\r\nany doubt, that all those even who have either imagined or admitted points\r\nattractive or points respective in the sky or the earth, and those who have\r\nimagined magnetick mountains, or rocks, or poles, will immediately begin to\r\nwaver as soon as they have perused these books of yours on the Magnet, and\r\nwillingly will march with your opinion. Finally, as to the views which you\r\ndiscuss in regard to the circular motion of the earth and of the\r\nterrestrial poles, although to some perhaps they will seem most\r\nsupposititious, yet I do not see why they should not gain some favour, even\r\namong the very men who do not recognize a sphærical motion of the earth;\r\nsince not even they can easily clear themselves from many difficulties,\r\nwhich necessarily follow from the daily motion of the {v} whole sky. For in\r\nthe first place it is against reason that that should be effected by many\r\ncauses, which can be effected by fewer; and it is against reason that the\r\nwhole sky and all the sphæres (if there be any) of the stars, both of the\r\nplanets and the fixed stars, should be turned round for the sake of a daily\r\nmotion which can be explained by the mere daily rotation of the earth. Then\r\nwhether will it seem more probable, that the æquator of the terrestrial\r\nglobe in a single second (that is, in about the time in which any one\r\nwalking quickly will be able to advance only a single pace) can accomplish\r\na quarter of a British mile (of which sixty equal one degree of a great\r\ncircle on the earth), or that the æquator of the _primum mobile_ in the\r\nsame time should traverse five thousand miles with celerity ineffable; and\r\nin the twinkling of an eye should fly through about five hundred British\r\nmiles, swifter than the wings of lightning, if indeed they maintain the\r\ntruth who especially assail the motion of the earth). Finally, will it be\r\nmore likely to allow some motion to this very tiny terrestrial globe; or to\r\nbuild up with mad endeavour above the eighth of the fixed sphæres those\r\nthree huge sphæres, the ninth (I mean), the tenth, and the eleventh, marked\r\nby not a single star, especially since it is plain from these books on the\r\nmagnet, from a comparison of the earth and the terrella, that a circular\r\nmotion is not so alien to the nature of the earth as is commonly supposed.\r\nNor do those things which are adduced from the sacred Scriptures seem to be\r\nspecially adverse to the doctrine of the mobility of the earth; nor does it\r\nseem to have been the intention of Moses or of the Prophets to promulgate\r\nany mathematical or physical niceties, but to adapt themselves to the\r\nunderstanding of the common people and their manner of speech, just as\r\nnurses are accustomed to adapt themselves to infants, and not to go into\r\nevery unnecessary detail. Thus in Gen. i. v. 16, and Psal. 136, the moon is\r\ncalled a great light, because it appears so to us, though it it is agreed\r\nnevertheless by those skilled in astronomy that many of the stars, both of\r\nthe fixed and wandering stars, are much greater. Therefore neither do I\r\nthink that any solid conclusion can be drawn against the earth's mobility\r\nfrom Psal. 104, v. 5; although God is said to have laid the foundations of\r\nthe earth that it should not be removed for ever; for the earth will be\r\nable to remain evermore in its own and self-same place, so as not to be\r\nmoved by any wandering motion, nor carried away from its seat (wherein it\r\nwas first placed by the Divine artificer). We, therefore, with devout mind\r\nacknowledging and adoring the inscrutable wisdom of the triune Divinity\r\n(having more diligently investigated and observed his admirable work in the\r\nmagnetical motions), induced by philosophical experiments and reasonings\r\nnot a few, do deem it to be probable enough that the earth, though resting\r\non its centre as on an immovable base and foundation, nevertheless is borne\r\naround circularly._\r\n\r\n_But passing over these matters (concerning which I believe no one has ever\r\ndemonstrated anything with greater certainty), without any doubt those\r\nmatters which you have discussed concerning the causes of the variation and\r\nof the magnetick dip below the horizon, not to mention many other matters,\r\nwhich it would take too long to speak of here, will gain very great favour\r\namongst all intelligent men, and especially (to speak after the manner of\r\nthe Chemists) amongst the sons of the magnetick doctrine. Nor indeed do I\r\ndoubt that when you have published these books of yours on the Magnet, you\r\nwill excite all the diligent and industrious shipmasters to take no less\r\ncare in observing the magnetick declination beneath the horizon than the\r\nvariation. Since (if not certain) it is at least probable, that the\r\nlatitude itself, or rather the effect of the latitude, can be found (even\r\nin very dark weather) much more accurately from that declination alone,\r\nthan can either the longitude or the effect of the longitude from the\r\nvariation, though the sun itself is shining brightly or all the stars are\r\nvisible, with the most skilful employment likewise of all the most exact\r\ninstruments. Nor is there any doubt but that those most learned men, Peter\r\nPlancius (not more deeply versed in Geography than in observations\r\nmagnetical), and Simon Stevinus, the most distinguished mathematician, will\r\nrejoice in no moderate degree, when they first see these magnetical books\r\nof yours, and observe their _[Greek: limeneuretikê]_, or _Haven-finding\r\nArt_, enlarged and enriched by so great and unexpected an addition; and\r\nwithout doubt they will urge all their own shipmasters (as far as they can)\r\nto observe also everywhere the magnetick declination below the horizon no\r\nless than the variation. May your Magnetical Philosophy, therefore, most\r\nlearned Dr. Gilbert, come forth into the light under the best auspices,\r\nafter being kept back not till the ninth year only (as Horace prescribes),\r\nbut already unto almost a second nine, a philosophy rescued at last by so\r\nmany toils, studyings, watchings, with so much ingenuity and at no moderate\r\nexpense maintained continuously through so many years, out of darkness and\r\ndense mist of the idle and feeble philosophizers, by means of endless\r\nexperiments skilfully applied to it; yet without neglecting anything which\r\nhas been handed down in the writings of any of the ancients or of the\r\nmoderns, all which you did diligently peruse and perpend. Do not fear the\r\nboldness or the prejudice of any supercilious and base philosophaster, who\r\nby either enviously calumniating or stealthily arrogating to himself the\r\ninvestigations of others seeks to snatch a most empty glory. Verily_\r\n\r\n  Envy detracts from great Homer's genius;\r\n\r\n_but_\r\n\r\n  Whoever thou art, Zoilus, thou hast thy name from him.\r\n\r\n_May your new physiology of the Magnet, I say (kept back for so many\r\nyears), come forth now at length into the view of all, and your Philosophy,\r\nnever to be enough admired, concerning the great Magnet (that is, the\r\nearth); for, believe me_\r\n\r\n  (If there is any truth in the forebodings of seers),\r\n\r\n_these books of yours on the Magnet will avail more for perpetuating the\r\nmemory of your name than the monument of any great Magnate placed upon your\r\ntomb._\r\n\r\n{vj}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Interpretation of certain words.[1]_\r\n\r\nTerrella, a globular loadstone.\r\n\r\nVerticity, polar vigour, not [Greek: peridinêsis] but [Greek: peridineisios\r\ndunamis]: not a vertex or [Greek: polos] but a turning tendency.\r\n\r\nElectricks, things which attract in the same manner as amber.\r\n\r\nExcited Magnetick, that which has acquired powers from the loadstone.\r\n\r\nMagnetick Versorium, a piece of iron upon a pin, excited by a loadstone.\r\n\r\nNon-magnetick Versorium, a versorium of any metal, serving for electrical\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nCapped loadstone, which is furnished with an iron cap, or snout.\r\n\r\nMeridionally, that is, along the projection of the meridian.\r\n\r\nParalleletically, that is, along the projection of a parallel.\r\n\r\nCusp, tip of a versorium excited by the loadstone.\r\n\r\nCross, sometimes used of the end that has not been touched and excited by a\r\nloadstone, though in many instruments both ends are excited by the\r\nappropriate termini of the stone.\r\n\r\nCork, that is, bark of the cork-oak.\r\n\r\nRadius of the Orbe of the Loadstone, is a straight line drawn from the\r\nsummit of the orbe of the loadstone, by the shortest way, to the surface of\r\nthe body, which, continued, will pass through the centre of the loadstone.\r\n\r\nOrbe of Virtue, is all that space through which the Virtue of any loadstone\r\nextends.\r\n\r\nOrbe of Coition, is all that space through which the smallest magnetick is\r\nmoved by the loadstone.\r\n\r\nProof, for a demonstration shown by means of a body.\r\n\r\nMagnetick Coition: since in magnetick bodies, motion does not occur by an\r\nattractive faculty, but by a concourse or concordance of both, not as if\r\nthere were an [Greek: helktikê dunamis] of one only, but a [Greek:\r\nsundromê] of both; there is always a coition of the vigour: and even of the\r\nbody if its mass should not obstruct.\r\n\r\nDeclinatorium, a piece of Iron capable of turning about an axis, excited by\r\na loadstone, in a declination instrument.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\n_Book 1._\r\n\r\nChap. 1.

Why at the Pole itself the Coition is stronger than in the other\r\nparts intermediate between the æquator and the pole; and on the proportion\r\nof forces of the coition in various parts of the earth and of the terrella.\r\n\r\nChap. 15. The Magnetick Virtue which is conceived in Iron is more apparent\r\nin an iron rod than in a piece of Iron that is round, square, or of other\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nChap. 16. Showing that Movements take place by the Magnetical Vigour though\r\nsolid bodies lie between; and on the interposition of iron plates.\r\n\r\nChap. 17.

An armed Loadstone does not indue an excited piece of Iron with\r\ngreater vigour than an unarmed.\r\n\r\nChap. 19. Union with an armed Loadstone is stronger; hence greater weights\r\nare raised; but the coition is not stronger, but generally weaker.\r\n\r\nChap. 20. An armed Loadstone raises an armed Loadstone, which also attracts\r\na third; which likewise happens, though the virtue in the first be somewhat\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nChap. 21. If Paper or any other Medium be interposed, an armed loadstone\r\nraises no more than an unarmed one.\r\n\r\nChap. 22.

The Centre of the Magnetick Virtues in the earth is the centre of\r\nthe earth; and in a terrella is the centre of the stone.\r\n\r\nChap. 28.

How Iron acquires Verticity through a loadstone, and how that\r\nverticity is lost and changed.\r\n\r\nChap. 4. Why Iron touched by a Loadstone acquires an opposite verticity,\r\nand why iron touched by the true Northern side of a stone turns to the\r\nNorth of the earth, by the true Southern side to the South; and does not\r\nturn to the South when rubbed by the Northern point of the stone, and when\r\nby the Southern to the North, as all who have written on the Loadstone have\r\nfalsely supposed.\r\n\r\nChap. 5.

On Mutation of Verticity and of Magnetick Properties, or on\r\nalteration in the power excited by a loadstone.\r\n\r\nChap. 11. On the Rubbing of a piece of Iron on a Loadstone in places midway\r\nbetween the poles, and upon the æquinoctial of a terrella.\r\n\r\nChap. 12. In what way Verticity exists in any Iron that has been smelted\r\nthough not excited by a loadstone.\r\n\r\nChap. 13. Why no other Body, excepting a magnetick, is imbued with\r\nverticity by being rubbed on a loadstone, and why no body is able to instil\r\nand excite that virtue, unless it be a magnetick.\r\n\r\nChap. 14. The Placing of a Loadstone above or below a magnetick body\r\nsuspended in æquilibrio changes neither the power nor the verticity of the\r\nmagnetick body.\r\n\r\nChap. 15. The Poles, Æquator, Centre in an entire Loadstone remain and\r\ncontinue steady; by diminution and separation of some part they vary and\r\nacquire other positions.\r\n\r\nChap. 16. If the Southern Portion of a Stone be lessened, something is also\r\ntaken away from the power of the Northern Portion.\r\n\r\nChap. 17. On the Use and Excellence of Versoria: and how iron versoria used\r\nas pointers in sun-dials, and the fine needles of the mariners' compass,\r\nare to be rubbed, that they may acquire stronger verticity.\r\n\r\n{viij} _Book 4._\r\n\r\nChap. 1.

The arc of variation is not changed equally in proportion to the\r\ndistance of places.\r\n\r\nChap. 5. An island in Ocean does not change the variation, as neither do\r\nmines of loadstone.\r\n\r\nChap. 6. The variation and direction arise from the disponent power of the\r\nearth, and from the natural magnetick tendency to rotation, not    from\r\nattraction, or from coition, or from other occult cause.\r\n\r\nChap. 7. Why the variation from that lateral cause is not greater than has\r\nhitherto been observed, having been rarely seen to reach two points    of\r\nthe mariners' compass, except near the pole.\r\n\r\nChap. 8. On the construction of the common mariners' compass, and on the\r\ndiversity of the compasses of different nations.\r\n\r\nChap. 9. Whether the terrestrial longitude can be found from the variation.\r\n\r\nChap. 10. Why in various places near the pole the variations are much more\r\nample than in a lower latitude.\r\n\r\nChap. 11. Cardan's error when he seeks the distance of the centre of the\r\nearth from the centre of the cosmos by the motion of the stone    of\r\nHercules; in his book 5, _On Proportions_.\r\n\r\nChap. 12.

The observations of variation by seamen vary, for the most part,\r\nand are uncertain: partly from error and inexperience, and the\r\nimperfections of the instruments: and partly from the sea being    seldom\r\nso calm that the shadows or lights can remain quite steady    on the\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nChap. 14.

I.\r\n\r\n_CHAP. I._\r\n\r\nANCIENT AND MODERN WRITINGS\r\non the Loadstone, with certain matters of mention only,\r\n_various opinions, & vanities_.\r\n\r\nAt an early period, while philosophy lay as yet rude and uncultivated in\r\nthe mists of error and ignorance, few were the virtues and properties of\r\nthings that were known and clearly perceived: there was a bristling forest\r\nof plants and herbs, things metallick were hidden, and the knowledge of\r\nstones was unheeded. But no sooner had the talents and toils of many\r\nbrought to light certain commodities necessary for the use and safety of\r\nmen, and handed them on to others (while at the same time reason and\r\nexperience had added a larger hope), than a thorough examination began to\r\nbe made of forests and fields, hills and heights; of seas too, and the\r\ndepths of the waters, of the bowels of the earth's body; and all things\r\nbegan to be looked into. And at length by good luck the magnet-stone was\r\ndiscovered in iron lodes, probably by smelters of iron or diggers of\r\nmetals. This, on being handled by metal folk, quickly displayed that\r\npowerful and strong attraction for iron, a virtue not latent and obscure,\r\nbut easily proved by all, and highly praised and commended. And in after\r\ntime when it had emerged, as it were out of darkness and deep dungeons, and\r\nhad become dignified of men on account of its strong and amazing attraction\r\nfor iron, many philosophers as well as physicians of ancient days\r\ndiscoursed of it, in short celebrated, as it were, its memory only; as for\r\ninstance Plato in the _Io_[2], Aristotle in the _De Anima_[3], in Book I.\r\nonly, Theophrastus the Lesbian, Dioscorides, C. Plinius Secundus, and\r\nJulius Solinus[4]. As handed down by them the loadstone merely attracted\r\niron, the rest of its virtues were all undiscovered. But that the story of\r\nthe {2} loadstone might not appear too bare and too brief, to this singular\r\nand sole known quality there were added certain figments and falsehoods,\r\nwhich in the earliest times, no less than nowadays, used to be put forth by\r\nraw smatterers and copyists to be swallowed of men. As for instance, that\r\nif a loadstone be anointed with garlick, or if a diamond be near, it does\r\nnot attract iron[5]. Tales of this sort occur in Pliny, and in Ptolemy's\r\n_Quadripartitum_; and the errors have been sedulously propagated, and have\r\ngained ground (like ill weeds that grow apace) coming down even to our own\r\nday, through the writings of a host of men, who, to fill put their volumes\r\nto a proper bulk, write and copy out pages upon pages on this, that, and\r\nthe other subject, of which they knew almost nothing for certain of their\r\nown experience. Such fables of the loadstone even Georgius Agricola\r\nhimself, most distinguished in letters, relying on the writings of others,\r\nhas embodied as actual history in his books _De Natura Fossilium_. Galen\r\nnoted its medicinal power in the ninth book of his _De Simplicium\r\nMedicamentorum Facultatibus_, and its natural property of attracting iron\r\nin the first book of _De Naturalibus Facultatibus_; but he failed to\r\nrecognize the cause, as Dioscorides before him, nor made further inquiry.\r\nBut his commentator Matthiolus repeats the story of the garlick and the\r\ndiamond, and moreover introduces Mahomet's shrine vaulted with\r\nloadstones[6], and writes that, by the exhibition of this (with the iron\r\ncoffin hanging in the air) as a divine miracle, the public were imposed\r\nupon. But this is known by travellers to be false. Yet Pliny relates that\r\nChinocrates the architect had commenced to roof over the temple of Arsinoe\r\nat Alexandria with magnet-stone[7], that her statue of iron placed therein\r\nmight appear to hang in space. His own death, however, intervened, and also\r\nthat of Ptolemy, who had ordered it to be made in honour of his sister.\r\nVery little was written by the ancients as to the causes of attraction of\r\niron; by Lucretius and others there are some short notices; others only\r\nmake slight and meagre mention of the attraction of iron: all of these are\r\ncensured by Cardan for being so careless and negligent in a matter of such\r\nimportance and in so wide a field of philosophizing; and for not supplying\r\nan ampler notion of it and a more perfect philosophy: and yet, beyond\r\ncertain received opinions and ideas borrowed from others and ill-founded\r\nconjectures, he has not himself any more than they delivered to posterity\r\nin all his bulky works any contribution to the subject worthy of a\r\nphilosopher. Of modern writers some set forth its virtue in medicine only,\r\nas [8]Antonius Musa Brasavolus, Baptista Montanus, Amatus Lusitanus, as\r\nbefore them Oribasius in his thirteenth chapter _De Facultate\r\nMetallicorum_, Aetius Amidenus, Avicenna, Serapio Mauritanus, Hali Abbas,\r\nSantes de Ardoynis, Petrus Apponensis, Marcellus[9], Arnaldus. Bare mention\r\nis made of certain points relating to the loadstone in very few words by\r\nMarbodeus Callus, Albertus, {3} Matthæus Silvaticus, Hermolaus Barbarus,\r\nCamillus Leonhardus, Cornelius Agrippa, Fallopius, Johannes Langius,\r\nCardinal Cusan, Hannibal Rosetius Calaber; by all of whom the subject is\r\ntreated very negligently, while they merely repeat other people's fictions\r\nand ravings. Matthiolus compares the alluring powers of the loadstone which\r\npass through iron materials, with the mischief of the torpedo, whose venom\r\npasses through bodies and spreads imperceptibly; Guilielmus Pateanus in his\r\n_Ratio Purgantium Medicamentorum_ discusses the loadstone briefly and\r\nlearnedly. Thomas Erastus[10], knowing little of magnetical nature, finds\r\nin the loadstone weak arguments against Paracelsus; Georgius Agricola, like\r\nEncelius[11] and other metallurgists, merely states the facts; Alexander\r\nAphrodiseus in his _Problemata_ considers the question of the loadstone\r\ninexplicable; Lucretius Carus, the poet of the Epicurean school, considers\r\nthat an attraction is brought about in this way: that as from all things\r\nthere is an efflux of very minute bodies, so from the iron atoms flow into\r\nthe space emptied by the elements of the loadstone, between the iron and\r\nthe loadstone, and that as soon as they have begun to stream towards the\r\nloadstone, the iron follows, its corpuscles being entangled. To much the\r\nsame effect Johannes Costæus adduces a passage from Plutarch; Thomas\r\nAquinas[12], writing briefly on the loadstone in Chapter VII. of his\r\n_Physica_, touches not amiss on its nature, and with his divine and clear\r\nintellect would have published much more, had he been conversant with\r\nmagnetick experiments. Plato thinks the virtue divine. But when three or\r\nfour hundred years afterwards, the magnetick movement to North and South\r\nwas discovered or again recognized by men, many learned men attempted, each\r\naccording to the bent of his own mind, either by wonder and praise, or by\r\nsome sort of reasonings, to throw light upon a virtue so notable, and so\r\nneedful for the use of mankind. Of more modern authors a great number have\r\nstriven to show what is the cause of this direction and movement to North\r\nand South, and to understand this great miracle of nature, and to disclose\r\nit to others: but they have lost both their oil and their pains; for, not\r\nbeing practised in the subjects of nature, and being misled by certain\r\nfalse physical systems, they adopted as theirs, from books only, without\r\nmagnetical experiments, certain inferences based on vain opinions, and many\r\nthings that are not, dreaming old wives' tales. Marsilius Ficinus ruminates\r\nover the ancient opinions, and in order to show the reason of the direction\r\nseeks the cause in the heavenly constellation of the Bear, supposing the\r\nvirtue of the Bear to prevail in the stone and to be transferred to the\r\niron. Paracelsus asserted that there are stars, endowed with the power of\r\nthe loadstone, which attract to themselves iron. Levinus Lemnius describes\r\nand praises the compass[13], and infers its antiquity on certain grounds;\r\nhe does not divulge the hidden miracle which he propounds. In the kingdom\r\n{4} of Naples the Amalfians were the first (so it is said) to construct the\r\nmariners' compass: and as Flavius Blondus says the Amalfians[14] boast, not\r\nwithout reason, that they were taught by a certain citizen, Johannes Goia,\r\nin the year thirteen hundred after the birth of Christ. That town is\r\nsituated in the kingdom of Naples not far from Salerno, near the promontory\r\nof Minerva; and Charles V. bestowed that principality on Andrea Doria, that\r\ngreat Admiral, on account of his signal naval services. Indeed it is plain\r\nthat no invention of man's device has ever done more for mankind than the\r\ncompass: some notwithstanding consider that it was discovered by others\r\npreviously and used in navigation, judging from ancient writings and\r\ncertain arguments and conjectures. The knowledge of the little mariners'\r\ncompass seems to have been brought into Italy by Paolo, the Venetian[15],\r\nwho learned the art of the compass in the Chinas about the year MCCLX.; yet\r\nI do not wish the Amalfians to be deprived of an honour so great as that of\r\nhaving first made the construction common in the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nGoropius[16] attributes the discovery to the Cimbri or Teutons, forsooth\r\nbecause the names of the thirty-two winds inscribed on the compass are\r\npronounced in the German tongue by all ship-masters, whether they be\r\nFrench, British, or Spaniards; but the Italians describe them in their own\r\nvernacular. Some think that Solomon, king of Judæa, was acquaint with the\r\nuse of the mariners' compass, and made it known to his ship-masters in the\r\nlong voyages when they brought back such a power of gold from the West\r\nIndies: whence also, from the Hebrew word _Parvaim_[17], Arias Montanus\r\nmaintains that the gold-abounding regions of Peru are named But it is more\r\nlikely to have come from the coast of lower Æthiopia, from the region of\r\nCephala, as others relate. Yet that account seems to be less true, inasmuch\r\nas the Phoenicians, on the frontier of Judæa, who were most skilled in\r\nnavigation in former ages (a people whose talents, work, and counsel\r\nSolomon made use of in constructing ships and in the actual expeditions, as\r\nwell as in other operations), were ignorant of magnetick aid, the art of\r\nthe mariners' compass: For had it been in use amongst them, without doubt\r\nthe Greeks and also Italians and all barbarians would have understood a\r\nthing so necessary and made famous by common use; nor could matters of much\r\nrepute, very easily known, and so highly requisite ever have perished in\r\noblivion; but either the learning would have been handed down to posterity,\r\nor some memorial of it would be extant in writing. Sebastian Cabot was the\r\nfirst to discover that the magnetick iron varied[18]. Gonzalus Oviedus[19]\r\nis the first to write, as he does in the _Historia_, that in the south of\r\nthe Azores it does not vary. Fernelius in his book _De Abditis Rerum\r\nCausis_ says that in the loadstone there is a hidden and abstruse cause,\r\nelsewhere calling it celestial; and he brings forth nothing but the unknown\r\nby means of what is still more unknown. {5} For clumsy, and meagre, and\r\npointless is his inquiry into hidden causes. The ingenious Fracastorio, a\r\ndistinguished philosopher, in seeking the reason for the direction of the\r\nloadstone, feigns Hyperborean magnetick mountains attracting magnetical\r\nthings of iron: this view, which has found acceptance in part by others, is\r\nfollowed by many authors and finds a place not in their writings only, but\r\nin geographical tables, marine charts, and maps of the globe: dreaming, as\r\nthey do, of magnetick poles and huge rocks, different from the poles of the\r\nearth. More than two hundred years earlier than Fracastorio there exists a\r\nlittle work, fairly learned for the time, going under the name of one Peter\r\nPeregrinus[20], which some consider to have originated from the views of\r\nRoger Bacon, the Englishman of Oxford: In which book causes for magnetick\r\ndirection are sought from the poles of the heaven and from the heaven\r\nitself. From this Peter Peregrinus, Johannes Taisnier of Hainault[21]\r\nextracted materials for a little book, and published it as new. Cardan\r\ntalks much of the rising of the star in the tail of the Greater Bear, and\r\nhas attributed to its rising the cause of the variation: supposing that the\r\nvariation is always the same, from the rising of the star. But the\r\ndifference of the variation according to the change of position, and the\r\nchanges which occur in many places, and are even irregular in southern\r\nregions, preclude the influence of one particular star at its northern\r\nrising. The College of Coimbra[22] seeks the cause in some part of the\r\nheaven near the pole: Scaliger in section CXXXI. of his _Exercitationes_ on\r\nCardan suggests a heavenly cause unknown to himself, and terrestrial\r\nloadstones nowhere yet discovered. A cause not due to those sideritic\r\nmountains named above, but to that power which fashioned them, namely that\r\nportion of the heaven which overhangs that northern point. This view is\r\ngarnished with a wealth of words by that erudite man, and crowned with many\r\nmarginal subtilities; but with reasonings not so subtile. Martin Cortes[23]\r\nconsiders that there is a place of attraction beyond the poles, which he\r\njudges to be the moving heavens. One Bessardus[24], a Frenchman, with no\r\nless folly notes the pole of the zodiack. Jacobus Severtius[25], of Paris,\r\nwhile quoting a few points, fashions new errors as to loadstones of\r\ndifferent parts of the earth being different in direction: and also as to\r\nthere being eastern and western parts of the loadstone. Robert Norman[26],\r\nan Englishman, fixes a point and region respective, not attractive; to\r\nwhich the magnetical iron is collimated, but is not itself attracted.\r\nFranciscus Maurolycus[27] treats of a few problems on the loadstone, taking\r\nthe trite views of others, and avers that the variation is due to a certain\r\nmagnetical island mentioned by Olaus Magnus[28]. Josephus Acosta[29],\r\nthough quite ignorant about the loadstone, nevertheless pours forth vapid\r\ntalk upon the loadstone. Livio Sanuto[30] in his Italian _Geographia_,\r\ndiscusses at length the question whether the prime magnetick {6} meridian\r\nand the magnetick poles are in the heavens or in the earth; also about an\r\ninstrument for finding the longitude: but through not understanding\r\nmagnetical nature, he raises nothing but errors and mists in that so\r\nimportant notion. Fortunius Affaytatus[31] philosophizes foolishly enough\r\non the attraction of iron, and its turning to the poles. Most recently,\r\nBaptista Porta[32], no ordinary philosopher, in his _Magia Naturalis_, has\r\nmade the seventh book a custodian and distributor of the marvels of the\r\nloadstone; but little did he know or ever see of magnetick motions; and\r\nsome things that he noted of the powers which it manifested, either learned\r\nby him from the Reverend Maestro Paolo, the Venetian[33], or evolved from\r\nhis own vigils, were not so well discovered or observed; but abound in\r\nutterly false experiments, as will be clear in due place: still I deem him\r\nworthy of high praise for having attempted so great a subject (as he has\r\ndone with sufficient success and no mean result in many other instances),\r\nand for having given occasion for further research. All these\r\nphilosophizers of a previous age, philosophizing about attraction from a\r\nfew vague and untrustworthy experiments, drawing their arguments from the\r\nhidden causes of things; and then, seeking for the causes of magnetick\r\ndirections in a quarter of the heavens, in the poles, the stars,\r\nconstellations, or in mountains, or rocks, space, atoms, attractive or\r\nrespective points beyond the heavens, and other such unproven paradoxes,\r\nare whole horizons wrong, and wander about blindly. And as yet we have not\r\nset ourselves to overthrow by argument those errors and impotent reasonings\r\nof theirs, nor many other fables told about the loadstone, nor the\r\nsuperstitions of impostors and fabulists: for instance, Franciscus\r\nRueus'[34] doubt whether the loadstone were not an imposture of evil\r\nspirits: or that, placed underneath the head of an unconscious woman while\r\nasleep, it drives her away from the bed if an adulteress: or that the\r\nloadstone is of use to thieves by its fume and sheen, being a stone born,\r\nas it were, to aid theft: or that it opens bars and locks, as Serapio[35]\r\ncrazily writes: or that iron held up by a loadstone, when placed in the\r\nscales, added nothing to the weight of the loadstone, as though the gravity\r\nof the iron were absorbed by the force of the stone: or that, as Serapio\r\nand the Moors relate, in India there exist certain rocks of the sea\r\nabounding in loadstone, which draw out all the nails of the ships which are\r\ndriven toward them, and so stop their sailing; which fable Olaus Magnus[36]\r\ndoes not omit, saying that there are mountains in the north of such great\r\npowers of attraction, that ships are built with wooden pegs, lest the iron\r\nnails should be drawn from the timber as they passed by amongst the\r\nmagnetick crags. Nor this: that a white loadstone may be procured as a love\r\npotion: or as Hali Abbas[37] thoughtlessly reports, that if held in the\r\nhand it will cure gout and spasms: Or that it makes one acceptable and in\r\nfavour with princes, or eloquent, as Pictorio[38] has {7} sung; Or as\r\nAlbertus Magnus[39] teaches, that there are two kinds of loadstones, one\r\nwhich points to the North, the other to the South: Or that iron is directed\r\ntoward the Northern stars by an influence imparted by the polar stars, even\r\nas plants follow the sun, as Heliotrope does: Or that there is a\r\nmagnet-stone situated under the tail of the Greater Bear, as Lucas Gauricus\r\nthe Astrologer stated: He would even assign the loadstone, like the\r\nSardonyx and onyx, to the planet Saturn, yet at the same time he assigns it\r\nwith the adamant, Jasper, and Ruby, to Mars; so that it is ruled by two\r\nplanets. The loadstone moreover is said by him to pertain to the sign\r\nVirgo; and he covers many such shameful pieces of folly with a veil of\r\nmathematical erudition. Such as that an image of a bear is engraved on a\r\nloadstone when the Moon faces towards the north, so that when hung by an\r\niron wire it may conciliate the influence of the celestial Bear, as\r\nGaudentius Merula[40] relates: Or that the loadstone drew iron and directed\r\nit to the north, because it is superior in rank to iron, at the Bear, as\r\nFicinus writes, and Merula repeats: Or that by day it has a certain power\r\nof attracting iron, but by night the power is feeble, or rather null: Or\r\nthat when weak and dulled the virtue is renewed by goats' blood, as\r\nRuellius[41] writes: Or that Goats' blood sets a loadstone free from the\r\nvenom of a diamond, so that the lost power is revived when bathed in goats'\r\nblood by reason of the discord between that blood and the diamond: Or that\r\nit removed sorcery from women, and put to flight demons, as Arnaldus de\r\nVillanova dreams: Or that it has the power to reconcile husbands to their\r\nwives, or to recall brides to their husbands, as Marbodeus Gallus[42],\r\nchorus-leader of vanities, teaches: Or that in a loadstone pickled in the\r\nsalt of a sucking fish[43] there is power to pick up gold which has fallen\r\ninto the deepest wells, according to the narratives of Cælius Calcagninus.\r\nWith such idle tales and trumpery do plebeian philosophers delight\r\nthemselves and satiate readers greedy for hidden things, and unlearned\r\ndevourers of absurdities: But after the magnetick nature shall have been\r\ndisclosed by the discourse that is to follow, and perfected by our labours\r\nand experiments, then will the hidden and abstruse causes of so great an\r\neffect stand out, sure, proven, displayed and demonstrated; and at the same\r\ntime all darkness will disappear, and all error will be torn up by the\r\nroots and will lie unheeded; and the foundations of a grand magnetick\r\nphilosophy which have been laid will appear anew, so that high intellects\r\nmay be no further mocked by idle opinions. Some learned men there are who\r\nin the course of long voyages have observed the differences of magnetick\r\nvariation: the most scholarly Thomas Hariot[44], Robert Hues, Edward\r\nWright, Abraham Kendall, all Englishmen; Others there are who have invented\r\nand produced magnetical instruments, and ready methods of observation,\r\nindispensable for sailors and to those travelling afar: {8} as William\r\nBorough[45] in his little book on the _Variation of the Compass_ or\r\nMagneticall Needle, William Barlowe[46] in his _Supply_, Robert Norman in\r\nhis _Newe Attractive_. And this is that Robert Norman[47] (a skilful seaman\r\nand ingenious artificer) who first discovered the declination of the\r\nmagnetick needle. Many others I omit wittingly; modern Frenchmen, Germans,\r\nand Spaniards, who in books written for the most part in their native\r\ntongues either misuse the placets of others, and send them forth furbished\r\nwith new titles and phrases as tricky traders do old wares with\r\nmeretricious ornaments; or offer something not worthy of mention even: and\r\nthese lay hands on some work filched from other authors and solicit some\r\none as their patron, or go hunting after renown for themselves among the\r\ninexperienced and the young; who in all branches of learning are seen to\r\nhand on errors and occasionally add something false of their own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nMagnet Stone, of what kind it is, and its\r\n_discovery._\r\n\r\nLoadstone, the stone which is commonly called the Magnet, derives its name\r\neither from the discoverer (though he was not Pliny's fabulous\r\nherdsman[48], quoted from Nicander, the nails of whose shoes and the tip of\r\nwhose staff stuck fast in a magnetick field while he pastured his flocks),\r\nor from the region of Magnesia in Macedonia, rich in loadstones: Or else\r\nfrom the city Magnesia in Ionia in Afia Minor, near the river Mæander.\r\nHence Lucretius says,\r\n\r\n          _The Magnet's name the observing Grecians drew_\r\n          _From the Magnetick region where it grew._\r\n\r\nIt is called Heraclean from the city Heraclea, or from the invincible\r\nHercules, on account of the great strength and domination and power which\r\nthere is in iron of subduing all things: it is also called _siderite_, as\r\nbeing of iron; being not unknown to the most ancient writers, to the\r\nGreeks, Hippocrates, and others, as also (I believe) to Jewish and Egyptian\r\nwriters; For in the oldest mines of iron, the most famous in Asia, the\r\nloadstone was often dug out with its uterine brother, iron. And if the\r\ntales be true which are told of the people of the Chinas, they were not\r\nunacquainted in primitive times with magnetical experiments, for even\r\namongst {9} them the finest magnets of all are still found. The Egyptians,\r\nas Manetho relates, gave it the name Os Ori: calling the power which\r\ngoverns the turning of the sun Orus, as the Greeks call it Apollo. But\r\nlater by Euripides, as narrated by Plato, it was designated under the name\r\nof Magnet. By Plato in the _Io_, Nicander of Colophon, Theophrastus,\r\nDioscorides, Pliny, Solinus, Ptolemy, Galen, and other investigators of\r\nnature it was recognized and commended; such, however, is the variety of\r\nmagnets and their points of unlikeness in hardness, softness, heaviness,\r\nlightness, density, firmness, and friability of substance: so great and\r\nmanifold are the differences in colour and other qualities, that they have\r\nnot handed down any adequate account of it, which therefore was laid aside\r\nor left imperfect by reason of the unfavourable character of the time; for\r\nin those times varieties of specimens and foreign products never before\r\nseen were not brought from such distant regions by traders and mariners as\r\nthey have been lately, and now that all over the globe all kinds of\r\nmerchandise, stones, woods, spices, herbs, metals, and ore in abundance are\r\ngreedily sought after: neither was metallurgy so generally cultivated in a\r\nformer age. There is a difference in vigour; as whether it is male or\r\nfemale: for it was thus that the ancients used often to distinguish many\r\nindividuals of the same species. Pliny quotes from Sotacus five kinds;\r\nthose from Æthiopia, Macedonia, Boeotia, the Troad, and Asia, which were\r\nespecially known to the ancients: but we have posited as many kinds of\r\nloadstones as there are in the whole of nature regions of different kinds\r\nof soil. For in all climates, in every province, on every soil, the\r\nloadstone is either found, or else lies unknown on account of its rather\r\ndeep site and inaccesible position; or by reason of its weaker and less\r\nobvious strength it is not recognized by us while we see and handle it. To\r\nthe ancients the differences were those of colour[49], how they are red and\r\nblack in Magnesia and Macedonia, in Boeotia red rather than black, in the\r\nTroad black, without strength: While in Magnesia in Asia they are white,\r\nnot attracting iron, and resemble pumice-stone. A strong loadstone of the\r\nkind celebrated so often nowadays in experiments presents the appearance of\r\nunpolished iron, and is mostly found in iron mines: it is even wont to be\r\ndiscovered in an unbroken lode by itself: Loadstones of this sort are\r\nbrought from East India, China, and Bengal, of the colour of iron, or of a\r\ndark blood or liver colour; and these are the finest, and are sometimes of\r\ngreat size, as though broken off a great rock, and of considerable weight;\r\nsometimes single stones, as it were, and entire: some of these, though of\r\nonly one pound weight, can lift on high four ounces of iron or a half-pound\r\nor even a whole pound. Red ones are found in Arabia, as broad as a tile,\r\nnot equal in weight to those brought from China, but strong and good: they\r\nare a little darker in the island of Elba in the Tuscan sea, and together\r\nwith {10} these also grow white ones, like some in Spain in the mines of\r\nCaravaca: but these are of lesser power. Black ones also are found, of\r\nlower strength, such as those of the iron mines in Norway and in sea-coast\r\nplaces near the strait of Denmark. Amongst the blue-black or dusky blue\r\nalso some are strong and highly commended. Other loadstones are of a leaden\r\ncolour, fissile and not-fissile, capable of being split like slates in\r\nlayers. I have also some like gray marble of an ashen colour, and some\r\nspeckled like gray marble, and these take the finest polish. In Germany\r\nthere are some perforated like honeycombs, lighter than any others, and yet\r\nstrong. Those are metallick which smelt into the best iron; others are not\r\neasily smelted, but are burned up. There are loadstones that are very\r\nheavy, as also others very light; some are very powerful in catching up\r\npieces of iron, while others are weaker and of less capacity, others so\r\nfeeble and barren that they with difficulty attract ever so tiny a piece of\r\niron and cannot repel an opposite magnetick. Others are firm and tough, and\r\ndo not readily yield to the artificer. Others are friable. Again, there are\r\nsome dense and hard as emery, or loose-textured and soft as pumice; porous\r\nor solid; entire and uniform, or varied and corroded; now like iron for\r\nhardness, yea, sometimes harder than iron to cut or to file; others are as\r\nsoft as clay. Not all magnets can be properly called stones; some rather\r\nrepresent rocks; while others exist rather as metallick lodes; others as\r\nclods and lumps of earth. Thus varied and unlike each other, they are all\r\nendowed, some more, some less, with the peculiar virtue. For they vary\r\naccording to the nature of the soil, the different admixture of clods and\r\nhumours, having respect to the nature of the region and to their subsidence\r\nin this last-formed crust of the earth, resulting from the confluence of\r\nmany causes, and the perpetual alternations of growth and decline, and the\r\nmutations of bodies. Nor is this stone of such potency rare; and there is\r\nno region wherein it is not to be found in some sort. But if men were to\r\nsearch for it more diligently and at greater outlay, or were able, where\r\ndifficulties are present, to mine it, it would come to hand everywhere, as\r\nwe shall hereafter prove. In many countries have been found and opened\r\nmines of efficacious loadstones unknown to the ancient writers, as for\r\ninstance in Germany, where none of them has ever asserted that loadstones\r\nwere mined. Yet since the time when, within the memory of our fathers,\r\nmetallurgy began to flourish there, loadstones strong and efficacious in\r\npower have been dug out in numerous places; as in the Black Forest beyond\r\nHelceburg; in Mount Misena not far from Schwartzenberg[50]; a fairly strong\r\nkind between Schneeberg and Annaberg in Joachimsthal, as was noticed by\r\nCordus: also near the village of Pela in Franconia. In Bohemia it occurs in\r\niron mines in the Lessa district and other places, as Georgious Agricola\r\nand several other men learned in metallurgy {11} witness. In like manner in\r\nother countries in our time it is brought to light; for as the stone\r\nremarkable for its virtues is now famous throughout the whole world, so\r\nalso everywhere every land produces it, and it is, so to speak, indigenous\r\nin all lands. In East India, in China, in Bengal near the river Indus it is\r\ncommon, and in certain maritime rocks: in Persia, Arabia, and the islands\r\nof the Red Sea; in many places in Æthiopia, as was formerly Zimiri, of\r\nwhich Pliny makes mention. In Asia Minor around Alexandria and the Troad;\r\nin Macedonia, Boeotia, in Italy, the island of Elba, Barbary; in Spain\r\nstill in many mines as aforetime. In England quite lately a huge power of\r\nit was discovered in a mine belonging to Adrian Gilbert, gentleman[51];\r\nalso in Devonshire and the Forest of Dean; in Ireland, too, Norway,\r\nDenmark, Sweden, Lapland, Livonia, Prussia, Poland, Hungary. For although\r\nthe terrestrial globe, owing to the varied humours and natures of the soil\r\narising from the continual succession of growth and decay, is in the lapse\r\nof time efflorescing through all its ambit deeper into its surface, and is\r\ngirt about with a varied and perishable covering, as it were with a veil;\r\nyet out of her womb ariseth in many places an offspring nigher to the more\r\nperfect body and makes its way to the light of day. But the weak and less\r\nvigorous loadstones, enfeebled by the flow of humours, are visible in every\r\nregion, in every strath. It is easy to discover a vast quantity of them\r\neverywhere without penetrating mountains or great depths, or encountering\r\nthe difficulties and hardships of miners; as we shall prove in the sequel.\r\nAnd these we shall take pains so to prepare by an easy operation that their\r\nlanguid and dormant virtue shall be made manifest. It is called by the\r\nGreeks[52] [Greek: heraklios], as by Theophrastus, and [Greek: magnêtis];\r\nand [Greek: magnês], as by Euripides, as quoted by Plato in the _Io_: by\r\nOrpheus[53] too [Greek: magnêosa], and [Greek: sideritês] as though of\r\niron: by the Latins _magnes_, _Herculeus_; by the French _aimant_[54],\r\ncorruptly from _adamant_; by the Spaniards _piedramant_: by the Italians\r\n_calamita_[55]; by the English LOADSTONE and ADAMANT STONE[56], by the\r\nGermans _magness_[57] and _siegelstein_: Among English, French, and\r\nSpaniards it has its common name from adamant; perhaps because they were at\r\none time misled by the name _sideritis_ being common to both: the magnet is\r\ncalled [Greek: sideritês] from its virtue of attracting iron: the adamant\r\nis called [Greek: sideritês] from the brilliancy of polished iron.\r\nAristotle designates it merely by the name of _the stone_:[58] [Greek:\r\nEoike de kai thalês ex hôn apomnêmoneuousi, kinêtikon ti tên psuchên\r\nhupolabein, eiper ton lithon ephê psuchên echein, hoti ton sidêron kinei]:\r\n_De Anima_, Lib. I. The name of magnet is also applied to another stone\r\ndiffering from siderite, having the appearance of silver; it is like\r\nAmianth in its nature; and since it consists of laminæ (like specular\r\nstone)[59], it differs in form: in German _Katzensilber_ and _Talke_[60].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{12} CHAP. III.\r\n\r\nThe Loadstone has parts distinct in their natural\r\n_power, & poles conspicuous for their property._\r\n\r\nThe stone itself manifests many qualities which, though known afore this,\r\nyet, not having been well investigated, are to be briefly indicated in the\r\nfirst place so that students may understand the powers of loadstone and\r\niron, and not be troubled at the outset through ignorance of reasonings and\r\nproofs. In the heaven astronomers assign a pair of poles for each moving\r\nsphere: so also do we find in the terrestrial globe natural poles\r\npreeminent in virtue, being the points that remain constant in their\r\nposition in respect to the diurnal rotation, one tending to the Bears and\r\nthe seven stars; the other to the opposite quarter of the heaven. In like\r\nmanner the loadstone has its poles, by nature northern and southern, being\r\ndefinite and determined points set in the stone, the primary boundaries of\r\nmotions and effects, the limits and governors of the many actions and\r\nvirtues. However, it must be understood that the strength of the stone does\r\nnot emanate from a mathematical point, but from the parts themselves, and\r\nthat while all those parts in the whole belong to the whole, the nearer\r\nthey are to the poles of the stone the stronger are the forces they acquire\r\nand shed into other bodies: these poles are observant of the earth's poles,\r\nmove toward them, and wait upon them. Magnetick poles can be found in every\r\nmagnet, in the powerful and mighty (which Antiquity used to call the\r\nmasculine) as well as in the weak, feeble and feminine; whether its figure\r\nis due to art or to chance, whether long, flat, square, three-cornered,\r\npolished; whether rough, broken, or unpolished; always the loadstone\r\ncontains and shows its poles. * But since the spherical form, which is also\r\nthe most perfect, agrees best with the earth, being a globe, and is most\r\nsuitable for use and experiment, we accordingly wish our principal\r\ndemonstrations by the stone to be made with a globe-shaped magnet as being\r\nmore perfect and adapted for the purpose. Take, then, a powerful loadstone,\r\nsolid, of a just size, uniform, hard, without flaw[61]; make of it a globe\r\nupon the turning tool used for rounding crystals and some other stones, or\r\nwith other tools as the material and firmness of the stone requires, for\r\nsometimes it is difficult to be worked. The stone thus perpared is a true,\r\nhomogeneous offspring of the earth and of the same shape with it:\r\nartificially possessed of the orbicular form which nature granted from the\r\nbeginning to the common mother earth: and it is a physical corpuscle imbued\r\nwith many virtues, by {13} means of which many abstruse and neglected\r\ntruths in philosophy buried in piteous darkness may more readily become\r\nknown to men. This round stone is called by us a [Greek: mikrogê] or\r\n_Terrella_[62]. To find, then, the poles conformable to the earth's, take\r\nthe round stone in hand, and place upon the stone a needle or wire of iron:\r\nthe ends of the iron move upon their own centre and suddenly stand still.\r\nMark the stone with ochre or with chalk where the wire lies and sticks:\r\nmove the middle or centre of the wire to another place, and so on to a\r\nthird and a fourth, always marking on the stone along the length of the\r\niron where it remains at rest: those lines show the meridian circles, or\r\nthe circles like meridians on the stone, or terrella, all of which meet as\r\nwill be manifest at the poles of the stone. By the circles thus continued\r\nthe poles are made out, the Boreal as well as the southern, and in the\r\nmiddle space betwixt these a great circle may be drawn for an æquator, just\r\nas Astronomers describe them in the heavens and on their own globes, or as\r\nGeographers do on the terrestrial globe: for that line so drawn on this our\r\nterrella is of various uses in our demonstrations and experiments\r\nmagnetical. Poles are also found in a round stone by a versorium, a piece\r\nof iron touched with a loadstone, and placed upon a needle or point firmly\r\nfixed on a foot so as to turn freely about in the following way:[63]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the stone A B the versorium is placed in such a way that the versorium\r\nmay remain in equilibrium: you will mark with chalk the course of the iron\r\nwhen at rest: Move the instrument to another spot, and again make note of\r\nthe direction and aspect: do the same thing in several places, and from the\r\nconcurrence of the lines of direction you will find one pole at the point\r\nA, the other at B. A versorium placed near the stone also indicates the\r\ntrue pole; when at right angles it eagerly beholds the stone and seeks the\r\npole itself directly, and is turned in a straight line through the axis to\r\nthe {14} centre of the stone. For instance, the versorium D faces toward A\r\nand F, the pole and centre, whereas E does not exactly respect * either the\r\npole A or the centre F[64]. A bit of rather fine iron wire, of the length\r\nof a barley-corn, is placed on the stone, and is moved over the regions and\r\nsurface of the stone, until it rises to the perpendicular[65]: for it\r\nstands erect at the actual pole, whether Boreal or austral; the further\r\nfrom the pole, the more it inclines from the vertical. The poles thus found\r\nyou shall mark with a sharp file or gimlet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\nWhich pole of the stone is the Boreal: & how it is\r\n_distinguished from the austral_.\r\n\r\nOne pole of the earth turns toward the constellation of the Cynosure, and\r\nconstantly regards a fixed point in the heaven (except so far as it changes\r\nby the fixed stars being shifted in longitude, which motion we recognize as\r\nexisting in the earth, as we shall hereafter prove): While the other pole\r\nturns to the opposite face of heaven, unknown to the ancients, now visible\r\non long voyages, and adorned with multitudinous stars: In the same way the\r\nloadstone has the property and power of directing itself North and South\r\n(the earth herself consenting and contributing force thereto) according to\r\nthe conformation of nature, which arranges the movements of the stone\r\ntowards its native situation. Which thing is proved thus: Place a magnetick\r\nstone (after finding the poles) in a round wooden vessel, a Bowl or dish,\r\nat the same time place it together with the vessel (like a sailor in a\r\nskiff) upon water in some large vessel or cistern, so that it may be able\r\nto float freely in the middle, nor touch the edge of it, and where the air\r\nis not disturbed by winds, which would thwart the natural movement of the\r\nstone. Hereupon the stone placed as it were in a ship, in the middle of the\r\nsurface of the still and unruffled water, will at once put itself in motion\r\nalong with the vessel that carries it, and revolve circularly, until its\r\naustral pole points to the north, and its boreal pole to the south. For it\r\nreverts from the contrary position to the poles: and although by the first\r\ntoo-vehement impulse it over-passes the poles; yet after returning again\r\nand again, it rests at length at the poles, or at the meridian (unless\r\nbecause of local reasons it is diverted some little from those points, or\r\nfrom the meridional line, by some sort of variation[66], the cause of which\r\nwe will hereafter state). However often you move it away from its place, so\r\noften by virtue of nature's noble dower does it seek again those sure and\r\n{15} determined goals; and this is so, not only if the poles have been\r\ndisposed in the vessel evenly with the plane of the horizon, but also in\r\nthe case of one pole, whether austral or boreal, being raised in the vessel\r\nten, or twenty, or thirty, or fifty or eighty degrees, above * the plane of\r\nthe horizon, or lowered beneath it: Still you shall see the boreal part of\r\nthe stone seek the south, and the austral part seek the north; So much so\r\nthat if the pole of the stone shall be only one degree distant from the\r\nZenith and highest point of the heaven, in the case of a spherical stone,\r\nthe whole stone revolves until the pole occupies its own site; though not\r\nin the absolutely direct line, it will yet tend toward those parts, and\r\ncome to rest in the meridian of the directive action. With a like impulse\r\ntoo it is borne if the austral pole have been raised toward the upper\r\nquarters, the same as if the Boreal had been exalted above the Horizon. But\r\nit is always to be noted that, though there are various kinds of unlikeness\r\nin the stones, and one loadstone may far surpass another in virtue and\r\nefficiency; yet all hold to the same limits, and are borne toward the same\r\npoints. Further it is to be remembered * that all who before our time wrote\r\nof the poles of the stone, and all the craftsmen and navigators, have been\r\nvery greatly in error in considering the part of the stone which tended to\r\nthe north as the north pole of the stone, and that which verged toward the\r\nsouth, the south pole, which we shall hereafter prove to be false. So badly\r\nhitherto hath the whole magnetick philosophy been cultivated, even as to\r\nits foundation principles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nLoadstone seems to attract Loadstone when in natural\r\nposition: but repels it when in a contrary one, and brings\r\n_it back to order_.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we must declare, in familiar language, what are the apparent\r\nand common virtues of the stone; afterward numerous subtilities, hitherto\r\nabstruse and unknown, hidden in obscurity, are to be laid open, and the\r\ncauses of all these (by the unlocking of nature's secrets) made evident, in\r\ntheir place, by fitting terms and devices. It is trite and commonplace that\r\nloadstone draws iron; in the same way too does loadstone attract loadstone.\r\nPlace the stone which you have seen to have poles clearly distinguished,\r\nand marked austral and boreal, in its vessel so as to float; and let the\r\npoles be rightly arranged with respect to the plane of the horizon, or, at\r\nany rate not much raised or awry: hold in your hand another stone the poles\r\nof which are also known; in {16} such a way that its austral pole may be\r\ntoward the boreal pole of the one that is swimming, and near it, sideways:\r\nfor the floating stone forthwith follows the other stone (provided it be\r\nwithin its force and dominion) and does not leave off nor forsake it until\r\nit adhæres; unless by withdrawing your hand, you cautiously avoid contact.\r\nIn like manner if you set the boreal pole of the one you hold in your hand\r\nopposite the austral pole of the swimming stone, they rush together and\r\nfollow each other in turn. For contrary poles allure contrary. If, however,\r\nyou apply in the same way the northern to the northern, and the austral to\r\nthe austral pole, the one stone puts the other to flight, and it turns\r\naside as though a pilot were pulling at the helm and it makes sail in the\r\nopposite ward as one that ploughs the sea, and neither stands anywhere, nor\r\nhalts, if the other is in pursuit. For stone disposeth stone; the one turns\r\nthe other around, reduces it to range, and brings it back to harmony with\r\nitself. When, however, they come together and are conjoined according to\r\nthe order of nature, they cohære firmly mutually. For instance, if you were\r\nto set the boreal pole of that stone which is in your hand before the\r\ntropic of Capricorn of a round floating loadstone (for it will be well to\r\nmark out on the round stone, that is the terrella, the mathematical circles\r\nas we do on a globe itself), or before any point between the æquator and\r\nthe austral pole; at once the swimming stone revolves, and so arranges\r\nitself that its austral pole touches the other's boreal pole, and forms a\r\nclose union with it. In the same way, again, at the other side of the\r\næquator, with the opposite poles, you may produce similar results; and thus\r\nby this art and subtilty we exhibit attraction, repulsion, and circular\r\nmotion for attaining a position of agreement and for declining hostile\r\nencounters. Moreover 'tis in one and the same stone that we are thus able\r\nto demonstrate all these things and also how the same part of one stone may\r\non division become either boreal or austral. Let A D be an oblong stone, in\r\nwhich A is the northern, D the southern pole; cut this into two equal\r\nparts, then set part A in its vessel on the water[67], so as to float.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{17} And you will then see[68] that A the northern point will turn to the\r\nsouth, as before; in like manner also the point D will move to the north,\r\nin the divided stone, as in the whole one. Whereas, of the parts B and C,\r\nwhich were before continuous, and are now divided, the one is southern B,\r\nthe other northern C. B draws C, desirous to be united, and to be brought\r\nback into its pristine continuity: for these which are now two stones were\r\nformed out of one: and for this cause C of the one turning itself to B of\r\nthe other, they mutually attract each other, and when freed from obstacles\r\nand relieved of their own weight, as upon the surface of water, they run\r\ntogether and are conjoined. But if you direct the part or point A to C in\r\nthe other stone, the one repels or turns away from the other: for so were\r\nnature perverted, and the form of the stone perturbed, a form that strictly\r\nkeeps the laws which it imposed upon bodies: hence, when all is not rightly\r\nordered according to nature, comes the flight of one from the other's\r\nperverse position and from the discord, for nature does not allow of an\r\nunjust and inequitable peace, or compromise: but wages war and exerts force\r\nto make bodies acquiesce well and justly. Rightly arranged, therefore,\r\nthese mutually attract each other; that is, both stones, the stronger as\r\nwell as the weaker, run together, and with their whole forces tend to\r\nunity, a fact that is evident in all magnets, not in the Æthiopian only, as\r\nPliny supposed. The Æthiopian magnets if they be powerful, like those\r\nbrought from China, because all strong ones show the effect more quickly\r\nand more plainly, attract more strongly in the parts nearest the pole, and\r\nturn about until pole looks directly at pole. The pole of a stone more\r\npersistently attracts and more rapidly seizes the corresponding part (which\r\nthey term the adverse part) of another stone; for instance, North pulls\r\nSouth; just so it also summons iron with more vehemence, and the iron\r\ncleaves to it more firmly whether it have been previously excited by the\r\nmagnet, or is untouched. For thus, not without reason hath it been ordained\r\nby nature, that the parts nearer to the pole should more firmly attract:\r\nbut that at the pole itself should be the seat, the throne, as it were, of\r\na consummate and splendid virtue, to which magnetical bodies on being\r\nbrought are more vehemently attracted, and from which they are with utmost\r\ndifficulty dislodged. So the poles are the parts which more particularly\r\nspurn and thrust away things strange and alien perversely set beside them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{18} CHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nLoadstone attracts the ore of iron, as well as iron\r\n_proper, smelted and wrought_.\r\n\r\nPrincipal and manifest among the virtues of the * magnet, so much and so\r\nanciently commended, is the attraction of iron; for Plato states that the\r\nmagnet, so named by Euripides, allures iron, and that it not only draws\r\niron rings but also indues the rings with power to do the same as the\r\nstone; to wit, draw other rings, so that sometimes a long chain of iron\r\nobjects, nails or rings is formed, some hanging from others. The best iron\r\n(like that which is called _acies_ from its use, or _chalybs_ from the\r\ncountry of the Chalybes) is best and strongly drawn by a powerful\r\nloadstone; whereas the less good sort, which is impure, rusty, and not\r\nthoroughly purged from dross, and not wrought in second furnaces, is more\r\nfeebly drawn; and yet more weakly when covered and defiled with thick,\r\ngreasy, and sluggish humours. It also draws ores of iron, those that are\r\nrich and of iron colour; the poorer and not so productive ores it does not\r\nattract, except they be prepared with some art. A loadstone loses some\r\nattractive virtue, and, as it were, pines away with age, if exposed too\r\nlong to the open air instead of being laid in a case with filings or scales\r\nof iron. Whence it should be buried in such materials; for there is nothing\r\nthat plainly resists this exhaustless virtue which does not destroy the\r\nform of the body, or corrode it; not even if a thousand adamants were\r\nconjoined. Nor do I consider that there is any such thing as the\r\nTheamedes[69], or that it has a power opposite to that of the loadstone.\r\nAlthough Pliny, that eminent man and prince of compilers (for it is what\r\nothers had seen and discovered, not always or mainly his own observations,\r\nthat he has handed down to posterity) has copied from others the fable now\r\nmade familiar by repetition: That in India there are two mountains near the\r\nriver Indus; the nature of one being to hold fast all that is iron, for it\r\nconsists of loadstone; the other's nature being to repel it, for it\r\nconsists of the Theamedes. Thus if one had iron nails in one's boots, one\r\ncould not tear away one's foot on the one mountain, nor stand still on the\r\nother. Albertus Magnus writes that a loadstone had been found in his day\r\nwhich with one part drew to itself iron, and repelled it with its other\r\nend; but Albertus observed the facts badly; for every loadstone attracts\r\nwith one end iron that has been touched with a loadstone, and drives it\r\naway with the other; and draws iron that been touched with a loadstone more\r\npowerfully than iron that has not been so touched.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{19} CHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nWhat Iron is, and of what substance,\r\n_and its uses._\r\n\r\nFor that now we have declared the origin and nature of the loadstone, we\r\nthink it necessary first to add a history of iron and to indicate the\r\nhitherto unknown forces of iron, before this our discourse goes on to the\r\nexplanation of magnetick difficulties and demonstrations, and to deal with\r\nthe coitions and harmonies of loadstone with iron. Iron is by all reckoned\r\nin the class of metals, and is a metal livid in colour, very hard, glows\r\nred-hot before it melts, being most difficult of fusion, is beaten out\r\nunder the hammer, and is very resonant. Chemists say that if a bed of fixed\r\nearthy sulphur be combined with fixed earthy quicksilver, and the two\r\ntogether are neither pure white but of a livid whiteness, if the sulphur\r\nprevail, iron is formed. For these stern masters of metals who by many\r\ninventions twisting them about, pound, calcine, dissolve, sublime, and\r\nprecipitate, decide that this metal, both on account of the earthy sulphur\r\nand of the earthy mercury, is more truly a son of the earth than any other;\r\nthey do not even think gold or silver, lead, tin, or copper itself so\r\nearthy; for that reason it is not smelted except in the hottest furnaces,\r\nwith bellows; and when thus fused, on having again grown hard it is not\r\nmelted again without heavy labour; but its slag with the utmost difficulty.\r\nIt is the hardest of metals, subduing and breaking all things, by reason of\r\nthe strong concretion of the more earthy matter. Wherefore we shall better\r\nunderstand what iron is, when we shall declare what are the causes and\r\nsubstance of metals, in a different way from those who before our time have\r\nconsidered them. Aristotle takes the material of the metals to be vapour.\r\nThe chemists in chorus pronounce their actual elements to be sulphur and\r\nquicksilver. Gilgil Mauritanus gives it as ashes moistened with water.\r\nGeorgius Agricola makes it out to be water and earth mixed; nor, to be\r\nsure, is there any difference between his opinion and the position taken by\r\nMauritanus. But ours is that metals arise and effloresce at the summits of\r\nthe earth's globe, being distinguished each by its own form, like some of\r\nthe other substances dug out of it, and all bodies around us. The earth's\r\nglobe does not consist of ashes or inert dust. Nor is fresh water an\r\nelement, but a more simple consistency of evaporated fluids of the earth.\r\nUnctuous bodies, fresh water devoid of properties, quicksilver and sulphur,\r\nnone of these are principia of metals: these latter, {20} things are the\r\nresults of a different nature, they are neither constant nor antecedent in\r\nthe course of the generation of metals. The earth emits various humours,\r\nnot begotten of water nor of dry earth, nor from mixtures of these, but\r\nfrom the substance of the earth itself: these humours are not distinguished\r\nby contrary qualities or substance, nor is the earth a simple substance, as\r\nthe Peripateticks dream. The humours proceed from vapours sublimated from\r\ngreat depths; all waters are extracts and, as it were, exudations from the\r\nearth. Rightly then in some measure does Aristotle make out the matter of\r\nmetals to be that exhalation which in continuance thickens in the lodes of\r\ncertain soils: for the vapours are condensed in places which are less hot\r\nthan the spot whence they issued, and by help of the nature of the soils\r\nand mountains, as in a womb, they are at fitting seasons congealed and\r\nchanged into metals: but it is not they alone which form ores, but they\r\nflow into and enter a more solid material, and so form metals. So when this\r\nconcreted matter has settled down in more temperate beds, it begins to take\r\nshape in those tepid places, just as seed in the warm womb, or as the\r\nembryo acquires growth: sometimes the vapour conjoins with suitable matter\r\nalone: hence some metals are occasionally though rarely dug up native, and\r\ncome into existence perfect without smelting: but other vapours which are\r\nmixed with alien soils require smelting in the way that the ores of all\r\nmetals are treated, which are rid of all their dross by the force of fires,\r\nand being fused flow out metallick, and are separated from earthy\r\nimpurities but not from the true substance of the earth. But in so far as\r\nthat it becomes gold, or silver, or copper, or any other of the existing\r\nmetals, this does not happen from the quantity or proportion of material,\r\nnor from any forces of matter, as the Chemists fondly imagine; but when the\r\nbeds and region concur fitly with the material, the metals assume forms\r\nfrom the universal nature by which they are perfected; in the same manner\r\nas all the other minerals, plants, and animals whatever: otherwise the\r\nspecies of metals would be vague and undefined, which are even now turned\r\nup in such scanty numbers that scarce ten kinds are known. Why, however,\r\nnature has been so stingy as regards the number of metals, or why there\r\nshould be as many as are known to man, it is not easy to explain; though\r\nthe simple-minded and raving Astrologers refer the metals each to its own\r\nplanet. But there is no agreement of the metals with the planets, nor of\r\nthe planets with the metals, either in numbers or in properties. For what\r\nconnexion is there of iron with Mars? unless it be that from the former\r\nnumerous instruments, particularly swords and engines of war, are\r\nfashioned. What has copper to do with Venus? or how does tin, or how does\r\nspelter correspond with Jupiter? They should rather be dedicated to Venus.\r\nBut this is old wives' talk. Vapour is then a remote cause in the\r\ngeneration of the metals; the fluid condensed from {21} vapours is a more\r\nproximate one, like the blood and semen in the generation of animals. But\r\nthose vapours and juices from vapours pass for the most part into bodies\r\nand change them into marcasites and are carried into lodes (for we have\r\nnumerous cases of wood so transmuted), the fitting matrices of bodies,\r\nwhere they are formed as metals. They enter most often into the truer and\r\nmore homogeneal substance of the globe, and in the process of time a vein\r\nof iron results; loadstone is also produced, which is nought else than a\r\nnoble kind of iron ore: and for this reason, and on account of its\r\nsubstance being singular, alien from all other metals, nature very rarely,\r\nif ever, mixes with iron any other metal, while the other metals are very\r\noften minutely mixed, and are produced together. Now when that vapour or\r\nthose juices happen to meet, in fitting matrices, with efflorescences\r\ndeformed from the earth's homogenic substance, and with divers precipitates\r\n(the forms working thereto), the remainder of the metals are generated (a\r\nspecifick nature affecting the properties in that place). For the hidden\r\nprimordial elements of metals and stones lie concealed in the earth, as\r\nthose of herbs and plants do in its outer crust. For the soil dug out of a\r\ndeep well, where would seem to be no suspicion of a conception of seed,\r\nwhen placed on a very high tower, produces, by the incubation of sun and\r\nsky, green herbage and unbidden weeds; and those of the kind which grow\r\nspontaneously in that region, for each region produces its own herbs and\r\nplants, also its own metals.\r\n\r\n  _[70]Here corn exults, and there the grape is glad,_\r\n  _Here trees and grass unbidden verdure add._\r\n  _So mark how Tmolus yields his saffrone store,_\r\n  _But ivory is the gift of Indian shore;_\r\n  _With incense soft the softer Shebans deal;_\r\n  _The stark Chalybeans' element is steel:_\r\n  _With acrid castor reek the Pontic wares,_\r\n  _Epirus wins the palm of Elian mares._\r\n\r\nBut what the Chemists (as Geber, and others) call fixed earthy sulphur in\r\niron is nothing else than the homogenic earth-substance concreted by its\r\nown humour, amalgamated with a double fluid: a metallick humour is inserted\r\nalong with a small quantity of the substance of the earth not devoid of\r\nhumour. Wherefore the common saying that in gold there is pure earth, but\r\nin iron mostly impure, is wrong; as though there were indeed such a thing\r\nas natural earth, and that the globe itself were (by some unknown process\r\nof refining) depurate. In iron, especially in the best iron, there is earth\r\nin its own nature true and genuine; in the other metals there is not so\r\nmuch earth as that in place of earth and precipitates there are\r\nconsolidated and (so to speak) fixed salts, which are efflorescences of the\r\nglobe, and which differ also greatly {22} in firmness and consistency: In\r\nthe mines their force rises up along with a twofold humour from the\r\nexhalations, they solidify in the underground spaces into metallic veins:\r\nso too they are also connate by virtue of their place and of the\r\nsurrounding bodies, in natural matrices, and take on their specific forms.\r\nOf the various constitutions of loadstones and their diverse substances,\r\ncolours, and virtues, mention has been made before: but, now having stated\r\nthe cause and origin of metals, we have to examine ferruginous matter not\r\nas it is in the smelted metal, but as that from which the metal is refined.\r\nQuasi-pure iron is found of its proper colour and in its own lodes; still,\r\nnot as it will presently be, nor as adapted for its various uses. It is\r\nsometimes dug up covered with white silex or with other stones. It is often\r\nthe same in river sand, as in Noricum. A nearly pure ore of iron is now\r\noften dug up in Ireland, which the smiths, without the labours of furnaces,\r\nhammer out in the smithy into iron implements. In France iron is very\r\ncommonly smelted out of a liver-coloured stone, in which are glittering\r\nscales; the same kind[71] without the scales is found in England, which\r\nalso they use for craftsmen's ruddle[72]. In Sussex in England[73] is a\r\nrich dusky ore and also one of a pale ashen hue, both of which on being\r\ndried for a time, or kept in moderate fires, presently acquire a\r\nliver-colour; here also is found a dusky ore square-shaped with a black\r\nrind of greater hardness. An ore having the appearance of liver is often\r\nvariously intermingled with other stones: as also with the perfect\r\nloadstone which yields the best of iron. There is also a rusty ore of iron,\r\none of a leaden hue tending to black, one quite black, or black mixed with\r\ntrue cobalt: there is another sort mixed either with pyrites, or with\r\nsterile plumbago. One kind is also like jet, another like bloodstone. The\r\nemery used by armourers, and by glaziers for glass-cutting, called amongst\r\nthe English Emerelstone, by the Germans Smeargel, is ferruginous; albeit\r\niron is extracted from it with difficulty, yet it attracts the versorium.\r\nIt is now and then found in deep iron and silver diggings. Thomas Erastus\r\nsays he had heard from a certain learned man of iron ores, of the colour of\r\niron, but quite soft and fatty, which can be smoothed with the fingers like\r\nbutter, out of which excellent iron can be smelted: somewhat the same we\r\nhave seen found in England, having the aspect of Spanish soap. Besides the\r\nnumberless kinds of stony ores, iron is extracted from clay, from clayey\r\nearth, from ochre, from a rusty matter deposited from chalybeate waters; In\r\nEngland iron is copiously extracted in furnaces often from sandy and clayey\r\nstones which appear to contain iron not more than sand, marl, or any other\r\nclay soils contain it. Thus in Aristotle's book _De Mirabilibus\r\nAuscultationibus_[74], \"There is said\" (he states) \"to be a peculiar\r\nformation of Chalybean and Misenian iron, for instance the sort collected\r\nfrom river gravel; some say {23} that after being simply washed it is\r\nsmelted in the furnace; others declare that it and the sediment which\r\nsubsides after several washings are cast in and purified together by the\r\nfire; with the addition of the stone pyrimachus which is found there in\r\nabundance.\" Thus do numerous sorts of things contain in their various\r\nsubstances notably and abundantly this element of iron and earth. However,\r\nthere are many stones, and very common ones, found in every soil, also\r\nearths, and various and mixed materials, which do not hold rich substances,\r\nbut yet have their own iron elements, and yield them to skilfully-made\r\nfires, yet which are left aside by metallick men because they are less\r\nprofitable; while other soils give some show of a ferruginous nature, yet\r\n(being very barren) are hardly ever smelted down into iron; and being\r\nneglected are not generally known. Manufactured irons differ very greatly\r\namongst themselves. For one kind is tenacious in its nature, and this is\r\nthe best; one is of medium quality: another is brittle, and this is the\r\nworst. Sometimes the iron, by reason of the excellency of the ore, is\r\nwrought into steel, as to-day in Noricum. From the finest iron, too, well\r\nwrought and purged from all dross, or by being plunged in water after\r\nheating, there issues what the Greeks call [Greek: stomôma]; the Latins\r\n_acies;_ others _aciarium,_ such as was at times called Syrian, Parthian,\r\nNoric, Comese, Spanish; elsewhere it is named from the water in which it is\r\nso often plunged, as at Como in Italy[75], Bambola and Tarazona in Spain.\r\n_Acies_ fetches a much larger price than mere iron. And owing to its\r\nsuperiority it better accords with the loadstone, from which more powerful\r\nquality it is often smelted, and it acquires the virtues from it more\r\nquickly, retains them longer at their full, and in the best condition for\r\nmagnetical experiments. After iron has been smelted in the first furnaces,\r\nit is afterward wrought by various arts in large worksteads or mills, the\r\nmetal acquiring consistency when hammered with ponderous blows, and\r\nthrowing off the dross. After the first smelting it is rather brittle and\r\nby no means perfect. Wherefore with us (English) when the larger military\r\nguns are cast, they purify the metal from dross more fully, so that they\r\nmay be stronger to withstand the force of the firing; and they do this by\r\nmaking it pass again (in a fluid state) through a chink, by which process\r\nit sheds its recremental matter. Smiths render iron sheets tougher with\r\ncertain liquids, and by blows of the hammer, and from them make shields and\r\nbreastplates that defy the blows of battle-axes. Iron becomes harder\r\nthrough skill and proper tempering, but also by skill turns out in a softer\r\ncondition and as pliable as lead. It is made hard by the action of certain\r\nwaters into which while glowing it is plunged, as at Bambola and Tarazona\r\nin Spain: It grows soft again, either by the effect of fire alone, when\r\nwithout hammering and without water, it is left to cool by itself; or by\r\nthat of grease into which it is plunged; or {24} (that it may the better\r\nserve for various trades) it is tempered variously by being skilfully\r\nbesmeared. Baptista Porta expounds this art in book 13 of his _Magia\r\nNaturalis_. Thus this ferric and telluric nature is included and taken up\r\nin various bodies of stones, ores, and earths; so too it differs in aspect,\r\nin form, and in efficiency. Art smelts it by various processes, improves\r\nit, and turns it, above all material substances, to the service of man in\r\ntrades and appliances without end. One kind of iron is adapted for\r\nbreastplates, another serves as a defence against shot, another protects\r\nagainst swords and curved blades (commonly called scimitars), another is\r\nused for making swords, another for horseshoes. From iron are made nails,\r\nhinges, bolts, saws, keys, grids, doors, folding-doors, spades, rods,\r\npitchforks, hooks, barbs, tridents, pots, tripods, anvils, hammers, wedges,\r\nchains, hand-cuffs, fetters, hoes, mattocks, sickles, baskets, shovels,\r\nharrows, planes, rakes, ploughshares, forks, pans, dishes, ladles, spoons,\r\nspits, knives, daggers, swords, axes, darts, javelins, lances, spears,\r\nanchors, and much ship's gear. Besides these, balls, darts, pikes,\r\nbreastplates, helmets, cuirasses, horseshoes, greaves, wire, strings of\r\nmusical instruments, chairs, portcullises, bows, catapults, and (pests of\r\nhuman kind) cannon, muskets, and cannon-balls, with endless instruments\r\nunknown to the Latins: which things I have rehearsed in order that it may\r\nbe understood how great is the use of iron, which surpasses a hundred times\r\nthat of all the other metals; and is day by day being wrought by\r\nmetal-workers whose stithies are found in almost every village. For this is\r\nthe foremost of metals, subserving many and the greatest needs of man, and\r\nabounds in the earth above all other metals, and is predominant. Wherefore\r\nthose Chemists are fools[76] who think that nature's will is to perfect all\r\nmetals into gold; she might as well be making ready to change all stones to\r\ndiamonds, since diamond surpasses all in splendour and hardness, because\r\ngold excels in splendour, gravity, and density, being invincible against\r\nall deterioration. Iron as dug up is therefore, like iron that has been\r\nsmelted, a metal, differing a little indeed from the primary homogenic\r\nterrestrial body, owing to the metallick humour it has imbibed; yet not so\r\nalien as that it will not, after the manner of refined matter, admit\r\nlargely of the magnetick forces, and may be associated with that prepotent\r\nform belonging to the earth, and yield to it a due submission.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       * {25}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nIn what countries and districts iron\r\n_originates._\r\n\r\nPlenty of iron mines exist everywhere, both those of old time recorded in\r\nearly ages by the most ancient writers, and the new and modern ones. The\r\nearliest and most important seem to me to be those of Asia. For in those\r\ncountries which abound naturally in iron, governments and the arts\r\nflourished exceedingly, and things needful for the use of man were\r\ndiscovered and sought after. It is recorded to have been found about\r\nAndria, in the region of the Chalybes near the river Thermodon in Pontus;\r\nin the mountains of Palestine which face Arabia; in Carmania: in Africa\r\nthere was a mine of iron in the Isle of Meroe; in Europe in the hills of\r\nBritain, as Strabo writes; in Hither Spain, in Cantabria. Among the\r\nPetrocorii and Cubi Biturges[77] (peoples of Gaul), there were worksteads\r\nin which iron used to be wrought. In greater Germany near Luna, as recorded\r\nby Ptolemy; Gothinian iron is mentioned by Cornelius Tacitus; Noric iron is\r\ncelebrated in the verses of poets; and Cretan, and that of Euboea; many\r\nother iron mines were passed over by these writers or unknown to them; and\r\nyet they were neither poor nor scanty, but most extensive. Pliny[78] says\r\nthat Hither Spain and all the district from the Pyrenees is ferruginous,\r\nand on the part of maritime Cantabria washed by the Ocean (says the same\r\nwriter) there is (incredible to relate) a precipitously high mountain\r\nwholly composed of this material. The most ancient mines were of iron\r\nrather than of gold, silver, copper or lead; since mainly this was sought\r\nbecause of the demand; and also because in every district and soil they\r\nwere easy to find, not so deep-lying, and less beset by difficulties. If,\r\nhowever, I were to enumerate modern iron workings, and those of this age\r\nand over Europe only, I should have to write a large and bulky volume, and\r\nsheets of paper would run short quicker than the iron, and yet for one\r\nsheet they could furnish a thousand worksteads. For amongst minerals, no\r\nmaterial is so ample; all metals, and all stones distinct from iron, are\r\noutdone by ferric and ferruginous matter. For you will not readily find any\r\nregion, and scarcely any country district over the whole of Europe (if you\r\nsearch at all deeply), that does not either produce a rich and abundant\r\nvein of iron or some soil containing or slightly charged with ferruginous\r\nstuff; and that this is {26} true any expert in the arts of metals and\r\nchemistry will easily find. Beside that which has ferruginous nature, and\r\nthe metallick lode, there is another ferric substance which does not yield\r\nthe metal in this way because its thin humour is burnt out by fierce fires,\r\nand it is changed into an iron slag like that which is separated from the\r\nmetal in the first furnaces. And of this kind is all clay and argillaceous\r\nearth, such as that which apparently forms a large part of the whole of our\r\nisland of Britain: all of which, if subjected very vehemently to intense\r\nheat, exhibits a ferric and metallick body, or passes into ferric vitreous\r\nmatter, as can be easily seen in buildings in bricks baked from clay,\r\nwhich, when placed next the fires in the open kilns (which our folk call\r\n_clamps_)[79] and burned, present an iron vitrification, black at the other\r\nend. Moreover all those earths as prepared are drawn by the magnet, and\r\nlike iron are attracted by it. So perpetual and ample is the iron offspring\r\nof the terrestrial globe. Georgius Agricola says that almost all\r\nmountainous regions are full of its ores, while as we know a rich iron lode\r\nis frequently dug in the open country and plains over nearly the whole of\r\nEngland and Ireland; in no other wise than as, says he, iron is dug out of\r\nthe meadows at the town of Saga in pits driven to a two-foot depth. Nor are\r\nthe West Indies without their iron lodes, as writers tell us; but the\r\nSpaniards, intent upon gold, neglect the toilsome work of iron-founding,\r\nand do not search for lodes and mines abounding in iron. It is probable\r\nthat nature and the globe of the earth are not able to hide, and are\r\nevermore bringing to the light of day, a great mass of inborn matter, and\r\nare not invariably obstructed by the settling of mixtures and\r\nefflorescences at the earth's surface. It is not only in the common mother\r\n(the terrestrial globe) that iron is produced, but sometimes also in the\r\nair from the earth's exhalations, in the highest clouds. It rained iron in\r\nLucania, the year in which M. Crassus was slain. The tale is told, too,\r\nthat a mass of iron, like slag, fell from the air in the Nethorian forest,\r\nnear Grina, and they narrate that the mass was many pounds in weight; so\r\nthat it could neither be conveyed to that place, on account of its weight,\r\nnor be brought away by cart, the place being without roads. This happened\r\nbefore the civil war waged between the rival dukes in Saxony. A similar\r\nstory, too, comes to us from Avicenna. It once rained iron in the\r\nTorinese[80], in various places (Julius Scaliger telling us that he had a\r\npiece of it in his house), about three years before that province was taken\r\nover by the king. In the year 1510 in the country bordering on the river\r\nAbdua (as Cardan writes[81] in his book _De Rerum Varietate_) there fell\r\nfrom the sky 1200 stones, one weighing 120 pounds, another 30 or 40 pounds,\r\nof a rusty iron colour and remarkably hard. These occurrences being rare\r\nare regarded as portents, like the showers of earth and stones mentioned in\r\nRoman history. But that it ever rained other metals is not {27} recorded;\r\nfor it has never been known to rain from the sky gold, silver, lead, tin,\r\nor spelter[82]. Copper, however, has been at some time noticed to fall from\r\nthe sky, and this is not very unlike iron; and in fact cloud-born iron of\r\nthis sort, or copper, are seen to be imperfectly metallick, incapable of\r\nbeing cast in any way, or wrought with facility. For the earth hath of her\r\nstore plenty of iron in her highlands, and the globe contains the ferric\r\nand magnetick element in rich abundance. The exhalations forcibly derived\r\nfrom such material may well become concreted in the upper air by the help\r\nof more powerful causes, and hence some monstrous progeny of iron be\r\nbegotten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nIron ore attracts iron ore.\r\n\r\nFrom various substances iron (like all the rest of the * metals) is\r\nextracted: such substances being stones, earth, and similar concretions\r\nwhich miners call veins because it is in veins[83], as it were, that they\r\nare generated. We have spoken above of the variety of these veins. If a\r\nproperly coloured ore of iron and a rich one (as miners call it) is placed,\r\nas soon as mined, upon water in a bowl or any small vessel (as we have\r\nshown before in the case of a loadstone), it is attracted by a similar\r\npiece of ore brought near by hand, yet not so powerfully and quickly as one\r\nloadstone is drawn by another loadstone, but slowly and feebly. Ores of\r\niron that are stony, cindery, dusky, red, and several more of other\r\ncolours, do not attract one another mutually, nor are they attracted by the\r\nloadstone itself, even by a strong one, no more than wood, or lead, silver,\r\nor gold. Take those ores and burn, or rather roast them, in a moderate\r\nfire, so that they are not suddenly split up, or fly asunder, keeping up\r\nthe fire ten or twelve hours, and gently increasing it, then let them grow\r\ncold, skill being shown in the direction in which they are placed: These\r\nores thus prepared a loadstone will now draw, and they now show a mutual\r\nsympathy, and when skilfully arranged run together by their own forces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{28}\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nIron ore has poles, and acquires them, and settles\r\n_itself toward the poles of the universe_.\r\n\r\nDeplorable is man's ignorance in natural science, and modern philosophers,\r\nlike those who dream in darkness, need to be aroused, and taught the uses\r\nof things and how to deal with them, and to be induced to leave the\r\nlearning sought at leisure from books alone, and that is supported only by\r\nunrealities of arguments and by conjectures. For the knowledge of iron\r\n(than which nothing is in more common use), and that of many more\r\nsubstances around us, remains unlearned; iron, a rich ore of which, placed\r\nin a vessel upon water, by an innate property of its own directs itself,\r\njust like the loadstone, North and South, at which points it rests, and to\r\nwhich, if it be turned aside, it reverts by its own inherent vigour. But\r\nmany ores, less perfect in their nature, which yet contain amid stone or\r\nearthy substances plenty of iron, have no such motion; but when prepared by\r\nskilful treatment in the fires, as shown in the foregoing chapter, they\r\nacquire a polar vigour (which we call verticity[84]); and not only the iron\r\nores in request by miners, but even earth merely charged with ferruginous\r\nmatter, and many rocks, do in like manner tend and lean toward those\r\nportions of the heavens, or more truly of the earth, if they be skilfully\r\nplaced, until they reach the desired location, in which they eagerly\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{29} CHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWrought Iron, not excited by a loadstone,\r\n_draws iron_.\r\n\r\nFrom the ore, which is converted, or separated, partly into metal, partly\r\ninto slag, by the intense heat of fires, iron is smelted in the first\r\nfurnaces in a space of eight, ten, or twelve hours, and the metal flows\r\naway from the dross and useless matter, forming a large and long mass,\r\nwhich being subjected to a sharp hammering is cut into parts, out of which\r\nwhen reheated in the second hearth of the forge, and again placed on the\r\nanvil, the smiths fashion quadrangular lumps, or more specially bars which\r\nare bought by merchants and blacksmiths, from which in smithies usually it\r\nis the custom to fashion the various implements. This iron we term\r\n_wrought_, and its attraction by the loadstone is manifest to all. But we,\r\nby more carefully trying everything[85], have found out that iron merely,\r\nby itself alone, not excited by any loadstone, not charged by any alien\r\nforces, attracts other iron; though it does not so eagerly snatch and\r\nsuddenly pluck at it as would a fairly strong loadstone; this you may know\r\nthus: A small piece of cork, the size of a hazel-nut, rounded, is traversed\r\nby an iron wire up to the middle of the wire: when set swimming on still\r\nwater apply to one end of it, close (yet so as not to touch), the end of\r\nanother iron wire; and wire draws wire, and one follows the other when\r\nslowly drawn back, and this goes on up to the proper boundaries. Let A be\r\nthe cork with the iron wire, B one end of it raised a little above the\r\nsurface of the water, C the end of the second wire, showing the way in\r\nwhich B is drawn by C. You may prove it in another way in a larger body.\r\nLet a long bright iron rod (such as is made for hangings and window\r\ncurtains) be hung in balance by a slender silken cord: to one end of this\r\nas it rests in the air bring a small oblong mass of polished iron, with its\r\nproper {30} end at the distance of half a digit. The balanced iron turns\r\nitself to the mass; do you with the same quickness draw back the mass in\r\nyour hand in a circular path about the point of equilibrium of the\r\nsuspension; the end of the balanced iron follows after it, and turns in an\r\norbit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nA long piece of Iron, even though not excited by a\r\n_loadstone, settles itself toward North and South._\r\n\r\nEvery good and perfect piece of iron, if drawn out in length, points North\r\nand South, just as the loadstone or iron rubbed with a magnetical body\r\ndoes; a thing that our famous philosophers have little understood, who have\r\nsweated in vain to set forth the magnetick virtues and the causes of the\r\nfriendship of iron for the stone. You may experiment with either large or\r\nsmall iron works, and either in air or in water. A straight piece of iron\r\nsix feet long of the thickness of your finger is suspended (in the way\r\ndescribed in the foregoing chapter) in exact æquipoise by a strong and\r\nslender silken cord. But the cord should be cross-woven of several silk\r\nfilaments, not twisted simply in one way; and it should be in a small\r\nchamber with all doors and windows closed, that the wind may not enter, nor\r\nthe air of the room be in any way disturbed; for which reason it is not\r\nexpedient that the trial should be made on windy days, or while a storm is\r\nbrewing. For thus it freely follows its bent, and slowly moves until at\r\nlength, as it rests, it points with its ends North and South, just as iron\r\ntouched with a loadstone does in shadow-clocks, and in compasses, and in\r\nthe mariners' compass. You will be able, if curious enough, to balance all\r\nat the same time by fine threads a number of small rods, or iron wires, or\r\nlong pins with which women knit stockings; you will see that all of them at\r\nthe same time are in accord, unless there be some error in this delicate\r\noperation: for unless you prepare everything fitly and skilfully, the\r\nlabour will be void. Make trial of this thing in water also, which is done\r\nboth more certainly and more easily. Let an iron wire two or three digits\r\nlong, more or less, be passed through a round cork, so that it may just\r\nfloat upon water; and as soon as you have committed it to the waves, it\r\nturns upon its own centre, and one end tends to the North, the other to the\r\nSouth; the causes {31} of which you will afterwards find in the laws of the\r\ndirection. This too you should understand, and hold firmly in memory, that\r\n* as a strong loadstone, and iron touched with the same, do not invariably\r\npoint exactly to the true pole but to the point of the variation; so does a\r\nweaker loadstone, and so does the iron, which directs itself by its own\r\nforces only, not by those impressed by the stone; and so every ore of iron,\r\nand all bodies naturally endowed with something of the iron nature, and\r\nprepared, turn to the same point of the horizon, according to the place of\r\nthe variation in that particular region (if there be any variation\r\ntherein), and there abide and rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nWrought iron has in itself certain parts Boreal and Austral:\r\nA magnetick vigour, verticity, and determinate\r\n_vertices, or poles_.\r\n\r\nIron settles itself toward the North and South; not with one and the same\r\npoint toward this pole or that: for one end of the piece of ore itself and\r\none extremity also of a wrought-iron wire have a sure and constant\r\ndestination to the North, the other to the South, whether the iron hang in\r\nthe air, or float on water, be the iron large rods or thinner wires. Even\r\nif it be a little rod, or a wire ten or twenty or more ells in length; one\r\nend as a rule is Boreal, the other Austral. If you cut off part of that\r\nwire, and if the end of that divided part were Boreal, the other end (which\r\nwas joined to it) will be Austral. Thus if you divide it into several\r\nparts, before making an experiment on the surface of water, you can\r\nrecognize the vertex[86]. In all of them a Boreal end draws an Austral and\r\nrepels a Boreal, and contrariwise, according to the laws magnetical. Yet\r\nherein wrought iron differs from the loadstone and from its own ore,\r\ninasmuch as in an iron ball of any size, such as those used for artillery\r\nor cannon, or bullets used for carbines or fowling-pieces, verticity is\r\nharder to acquire and is less apparent than in a piece of loadstone, or of\r\nore itself, or than in a round loadstone. But in long and extended pieces\r\nof iron a power is at once discerned; the causes of which fact, and the\r\nmethods by which it acquires its verticity and its poles without use of a\r\nloadstone, as well as the reasons for all the other obscure features of\r\nverticity, we shall set forth in describing the motion of direction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{32} CHAP. XIIII.\r\n\r\nConcerning other powers of loadstone, and its\r\n_medicinal properties_.\r\n\r\nDioscorides prescribes loadstone to be given with sweetened water, three\r\nscruples' weight, to expel gross humours. Galen writes that a like quantity\r\nof bloodstone avails. Others relate that loadstone perturbs the mind and\r\nmakes folk melancholick, and mostly kills. Gartias ab Horto[87] thinks it\r\nnot deleterious or injurious to health. The natives of East India tell us,\r\nhe says, that loadstone taken in small doses preserves youth. On which\r\naccount the aged king, Zeilam, is said to have ordered the pans in which\r\nhis victuals were cooked to be made of loadstone. The person (says he) to\r\nwhom this order was given told me so himself. There are many varieties of\r\nloadstone produced by differences in the mingling of earths, metals, and\r\njuices; hence they are altogether unlike in their virtues and effects, due\r\nto propinquities of places and of agnate bodies, and arising from the pits\r\nthemselves as it were from the matrices being soul. One loadstone is\r\ntherefore able to purge the stomach, and another to check purging, to cause\r\nby its fumes a serious shock to the mind, to produce a gnawing at the\r\nvitals, or to bring on a grave relapse; in case of which ills they exhibit\r\ngold and emerald, using an abominable imposture for lucre. Pure loadstone\r\nmay, indeed, be not only harmless, but even able to correct an over-fluid\r\nand putrescent state of the bowels and bring them back to a better\r\ntemperament; of this sort usually are the oriental magnets from China, and\r\nthe denser ones from Bengal, which are neither misliking nor unpleasant to\r\nthe actual senses. Plutarch and Claudius Ptolemy[88], and all the copyists\r\nsince their time, think that a loadstone smeared with garlick does not\r\nallure iron. Hence some suspect that garlick is of avail against any\r\ndeleterious power of the magnet: thus in philosophy many false and idle\r\nconjectures arise from fables and falsehoods. Some physicians[89] have that\r\na loadstone has power to extract the iron of an arrow from the human body.\r\nBut it is when whole that the loadstone draws, not when pulverized and\r\nformless, buried in plasters; for it does not attract by reason of its\r\nmaterial, but is rather adapted for the healing of open wounds, by reason\r\nof exsiccation, closing up and drying the sore, an effect by which the\r\narrow-heads would rather be retained in the wounds. Thus vainly and\r\npreposterously do the sciolists {33} look for remedies while ignorant of\r\nthe true causes of things. The application of a loadstone for all sorts of\r\nheadaches no more cures them (as some make out) than would an iron helmet\r\nor a steel cap. To give it in a draught to dropsical persons is an error of\r\nthe ancients, or an impudent tale of the copyists, though one kind of ore\r\nmay be found which, like many more minerals, purges the stomach; but this\r\nis due to some defect of that ore and not to any magnetick property.\r\nNicolaus puts a large quantity of loadstone into his divine plaster[90],\r\njust as the Augsburgers do into a black plaster[91] for fresh wounds and\r\nstabs; the virtue of which dries them up without smart, so that it proves\r\nan efficacious medicament. In like manner also Paracelsus to the same end\r\nmingles it in his plaster for stab wounds[92].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nThe Medicinal Virtue of Iron.[93]\r\n\r\nNot foreign to our present purpose will it be to treat briefly also of the\r\nmedicinal virtue of iron: for it is a prime remedial for some diseases of\r\nthe human body, and by its virtues, both those that are natural and those\r\nacquired by suitable preparation, it works marvellous changes in the human\r\nbody, so that we may the more surely recognize its nature through its\r\nmedicinal virtue and through certain manifest experiments. So that even\r\nthose tyros in medicine who abuse this most famous medicament may learn to\r\nprescribe it with better judgment for the healing of the sick, and not, as\r\ntoo often they use it, to their harm. The best iron, Stomoma, or Chalybs,\r\nAcies, or Aciarium, is reduced to a fine powder by a file; the powder is\r\nsteeped in the sharpest vinegar, and dried in the sun, and again soused in\r\nvinegar, and dried; afterwards it is washed in spring water or other\r\nsuitable water, and dried; then for the second time it is pulverized and\r\nreduced on porphyry, passed through a very fine sieve, and put back for\r\nuse. It is given chiefly in cases of laxity and over-humidity of the liver,\r\nin enlargement of the spleen, after due evacuations; for which reason it\r\nrestores young girls when pallid, sickly, and lacking colour, to health and\r\nbeauty; since it is very siccative, and is astringent without harm. But\r\nsome who in every internal malady always talk of obstruction {34} of the\r\nliver and spleen, think it beneficial in those cases because it removes\r\nobstructions, mainly trusting to the opinions of certain Arabians[94]:\r\nwherefore they administer it to the dropsical and to those suffering from\r\ntumour of the liver or from chronic jaundice, and to persons troubled with\r\nhypochondrical melancholia or any stomachic disorder, or add it to\r\nelectuaries, without doubt to the grievous injury of many of their\r\npatients. Fallopius commends it prepared in his own way for tumours of the\r\nspleen, but is much mistaken; for loadstone is pre-eminently good for\r\nspleens relaxed with humour, and swollen; but it is so far from curing\r\nspleens thickened into a tumour that it mightily confirms the malady. For\r\nthose drugs which are strong siccatives and absorb humour force the viscera\r\nwhen hardened into a tumour more completely into a quasi-stony body. There\r\nare some who roast iron in a closed oven with fierce firing, and burn it\r\nstrongly, until it turns red, and they call this Saffron of Mars; which is\r\na powerful siccative, and more quickly penetrates the intestines. Moreover\r\nthey order violent exercise, that the drug may enter the viscera while\r\nheated and so reach the place affected; wherefore also it is reduced to a\r\nvery fine flour; otherwise it only sticks in the stomach and in the chyle\r\nand does not penetrate to the intestines. As a dry and earthy medicament,\r\nthen, it is shown by the most certain experiments to be, after proper\r\nevacuations, a remedy for diseases arising from humour (when the viscera\r\nare charged and overflowing with watery rheum). Prepared steel is a\r\nmedicament proper for enlarged spleen. Iron waters too are effectual in\r\nreducing the spleen, although as a rule iron is of a frigid and astringent\r\nefficiency, not a laxative; but it effects this neither by heat nor by\r\ncold, but from its own dryness when mixed with a penetrative fluid: it thus\r\ndisperses the humour, thickens the villi, hardens the tissues, and\r\ncontracts them when lax; while the inherent heat in the member thus\r\nstrengthened, being increased in power, dissipates what is left. Whereas if\r\nthe liver be hardened and weakened by old age or a chronic obstruction, or\r\nthe spleen be shrivelled and contracted to a schirrus, by which troubles\r\nthe fleshy parts of the limbs grow flaccid, and water under the skin\r\ninvades the body, in the case of these conditions the introduction of iron\r\naccelerates the fatal end, and considerably increases the malady. Amongst\r\nrecent writers there are some who in cases of drought of the liver\r\nprescribe, as a much lauded and famous remedy, the electuary of iron slag,\r\ndescribed by Rhazes[95] in his ninth book _ad Almansorem_, Chap. 63, or\r\nprepared filings of steel; an evil and deadly advice: which if they do not\r\nsome time understand from our philosophy, at least everyday experience, and\r\nthe decline and death of their patients, will convince them, even the\r\nsluggish and lazy. Whether iron be warm or cold is variously contended by\r\n{35} many. By Manardus, Curtius, Fallopius and others, many reasons are\r\nadduced on both sides; each settles it according to his own sentiment. Some\r\nmake it to be cold, saying that iron has the property of refrigerating,\r\nbecause Aristotle in his _Meteorologica_ would put iron in the class of\r\nthings which grow concreted in cold by emission of the whole of their Heat:\r\nGalen, too, says that iron has its consistency from cold; also that it is\r\nan earthy and dense body. Further that iron is astringent, also that\r\nChalybeate water quenches thirst: and they adduce the cooling effect of\r\nthermal iron waters. Others, however, maintain that it is Warm, because of\r\nHippocrates making out that waters are warm which burst forth from places\r\nwhere iron exists. Galen says that in all metals there is considerable\r\nsubstance, or essence, of fire. Paolo[96] affirms that iron waters are\r\nwarm. Rhazes will have it that iron is warm and dry in the third degree.\r\nThe Arabians think that it opens the spleen and liver; wherefore also that\r\niron is warm. Montagnana recommends it in cold affections of the uterus and\r\nstomach. Thus do the smatterers cross swords together, and puzzle inquiring\r\nminds by their vague conjectures, and wrangle for trifles as for goats'\r\nwool, when they philosophize, wrongly allowing and accepting properties:\r\nbut these matters will appear more plainly by and by when we begin to\r\ndiscuss the causes of things; the clouds being dispersed that have so\r\ndarkened all Philosophy. Filings, scales, and slag of iron are, as Avicenna\r\nmakes out, not wanting in deleterious power (haply when they are not well\r\nprepared or are taken in larger quantity than is fit), hence they cause\r\nviolent pain in the bowels, roughness of the mouth and tongue, marasmus,\r\nand shrivelling of the limbs. But Avicenna wrongly[97] and old-womanishly\r\nmakes out that the proper antidote to this iron poison is loadstone to the\r\nweight of a drachm taken as a draught in the juice of mercurialis or of\r\nBeet; for loadstone is of a twofold nature, usually malefiant and\r\npernicious, nor does it resist iron, since it attracts it; nor when drunk\r\nin a draught in the form of powder does it avail to attract or repel, but\r\nrather inflicts the same evils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       * {36}\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nThat loadstone & iron ore are the same, but iron an\r\n_extract from both, as other metals are from their own_\r\nores; & that all magnetick virtues, though\r\n_weaker, exist in the ore itself & in\r\nsmelted iron._\r\n\r\nHitherto we have declared the nature & powers of the loadstone, & also the\r\nproperties & essence of iron; it now remains to show their mutual\r\naffinities, & kinship, so to speak, & how very closely conjoined these\r\nsubstances are. At the highest part of the terrestrial globe, or at its\r\nperishable surface & rind, as it were, these two bodies usually originate &\r\nare produced in one and the same matrix, as twins in one mine. Strong\r\nloadstones are dug up by themselves, weaker ones too have their own proper\r\nvein. Both are found in iron mines. Iron ore most often occurs alone,\r\nwithout strong loadstone (for the more perfect are rarely met with). Strong\r\nloadstone is a stone resembling iron; out of it is usually smelted the\r\nfinest iron, which the Greeks call _stomoma_, the Latins _acies_, the\r\nBarbarians (not amiss) _aciare_, or _aciarium_. This same stone draws,\r\nrepels, controls other loadstones, directs itself to the poles of the\r\nworld, picks up smelted iron, and works many other wonders, some already\r\nset forth by us, but many more which we must demonstrate more fully. A\r\nweaker loadstone, however, will exhibit all these powers, but in a lesser\r\ndegree; while iron ore, & also wrought iron (if they have been prepared)\r\nshow their strength in all magnetick experiments not less than do feeble\r\nand weak * loadstones; & an inert piece of ore, & one possessed of no\r\nmagnetick properties, & just thrown out[98] of the pit, when roasted in the\r\nfire & prepared with due art (by the elimination of humours & foreign\r\nexcretions) awakes, and becomes in power & potency a magnet, * occasionally\r\na stone or iron ore is mined, which attracts forthwith without being\r\nprepared: for native iron of the right colour attracts and governs iron\r\nmagnetically. One form then belongs to the one mineral, one species, one\r\nself-same essence. For to me there seems to be a greater difference, &\r\nunlikeness, between the strongest {37} loadstone, & a weak one which scarce\r\ncan attract a single chip of iron; between one that is stout, strong,\r\nmetallick, & one that is soft, friable, clayey; amidst such variety of\r\ncolour, substance, quality, & weight; than there is on the one hand between\r\nthe best ore, rich in iron, or iron that is metallick from the beginning,\r\nand on the other the most excellent loadstone. Usually, too, there are no\r\nmarks to distinguish them, and even metallurgists cannot decide between\r\nthem, because they agree together in all respects. Moreover we see that the\r\nbest loadstone and the ore of iron are both as it were distressed by the\r\nsame maladies & diseases, both run to old age in the same way & exhibit the\r\nsame marks of it, are preserved & keep their properties by the same\r\nremedies & safeguards; & yet again the one increases the potency of the\r\nother, & by artfully devised adjuncts marvellously intensifies, & exalts\r\nit. For both are impaired by the more acrid juices as by poisons, & the\r\naqua fortis of the Chemists inflicts on both the same wounds, and when\r\nexposed too long to harm from the atmosphere, they both alike pine away, so\r\nto speak, & grow old; each is preserved by being kept in the dust &\r\nscrapings of the other; & when a fit piece of steel or iron is adjoined\r\nabove its pole, the loadstone's vigour is augmented through the firm union.\r\nThe loadstone is laid up in iron filings, not that iron is its food; as\r\nthough loadstone were alive and needed feeding, as Cardan\r\nphilosophizes[99]; nor yet that so it is delivered from the inclemency of\r\nthe weather (for which cause it as well as iron is laid up in bran by\r\nScaliger; mistakenly, however, for they are not preserved well in this way,\r\nand keep for years their own fixed forms): nor yet, since they remain\r\nperfect by the mutual action of their powders, do their extremities waste\r\naway, but are cherished & preserved, like by like. For just as in their own\r\nplaces, in the mines, bodies like to each other endure for many ages entire\r\nand uncorrupt, when surrounded by bodies of the same stuff, as the lesser\r\ninterior parts in a great mass: so loadstone and ore of iron, when inclosed\r\nin a mound of the same material, do not exhale their native humour, do not\r\nwaste away, but retain their soundness. A loadstone lasts longer in filings\r\nof smelted iron, & a piece of iron ore excellently also in dust of\r\nloadstone; as also smelted iron in filings of loadstone & even in those of\r\niron. Then both these allied bodies have a true & just form of one & the\r\nsame species; a form which until this day was considered by all, owing to\r\ntheir outward unlikeness & the inequality of the potency that is the same\r\ninnate in both, to be different & unlike in kind; the smatterers not\r\nunderstanding that the same powers, though differing in strength, exist in\r\nboth alike. And in fact they both are true & intimate parts of the earth, &\r\nas such retain the prime natural properties of mutually attracting, of\r\nmoving, & of disposing themselves toward the position of the world, {38}\r\nand of the terrestrial globe; which properties they also impart to each\r\nother, and increase, confirm, receive, and retain each other's forces. The\r\nstronger fortifies the weaker, not as though aught were taken away from its\r\nown substance, or its proper vigour, nor because any corporeal substance is\r\nimparted, but the dormant virtue of the one is aroused by the other,\r\nwithout loss. For if with a single small stone you touch a thousand bits of\r\niron for the use of mariners[100], that loadstone attracts iron no less\r\nstrongly than before; with the same stone weighing one pound, any one will\r\nbe able to suspend in the air a thousand pounds of iron. For if any one\r\nwere to fix high up on the walls so many iron nails of so great a weight, &\r\nwere to apply to them the same number of nails touched, according to the\r\nart, by a loadstone, they would all be seen to hang in the air through the\r\nforce of one small stone. So this is not solely the action, labour, or\r\noutlay of the loadstone; but the iron, which is in a sense an extract from\r\nloadstone, and a fusion of loadstone into metal, & conceives vigour from\r\nit, & by proximity strengthens the magnetick faculties, doth itself, from\r\nwhatever lode it may have come, raise its own inborn forces through the\r\npresence & contact of the stone, even when solid bodies intervene. Iron\r\nthat has been touched, acts anew on another piece of iron by contact, &\r\nadapts it for magnetick movements, & this again a third. But if you rub\r\nwith a loadstone any other metal, or wood, or bones, or glass, as they will\r\nnot be moved toward any particular and determinate quarter of heaven, nor\r\nbe attracted by any magnetick body, so they are able not to impart any\r\nmagnetick property to other bodies or to iron itself by attrition, & by\r\ninfection. Loadstone differs from iron ore, as also from some weaker\r\nmagnets, in that when molten in the furnace into a ferric & metallick fused\r\nmass, it does not so readily flow & dissolve into metal; but is sometimes\r\nburnt to ashes in large furnaces; a result which it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose arises from its having some kind of sulphureous matter mixed with\r\nit, or from its own excellence & simpler nature, or from the likeness &\r\ncommon form which it has with the common mother, the Great Magnet. For\r\nearths, and iron stones, magnets abounding in metal, are the more imbued &\r\nmarred with excrementitious metallick humours, and earthy corruptions of\r\nsubstance, as numbers of loadstones are weaker from the mine; hence they\r\nare a little further remote from the common mother, & are degenerate, &\r\nwhen smelted in the furnace undergo fusion more easily, & give out a more\r\ncertain metallick product, & a metal that is softer, not a tough steel. The\r\nmajority of loadstones (if not unfairly burnt[101]) yield in the furnace a\r\nvery excellent iron. But iron ore also agrees in all those primary\r\nqualities with loadstone; for both, being nearer and more closely akin to\r\nthe earth above all bodies known to us, have in themselves {39} a magnetick\r\nsubstance, & one that is more homogenic, true & cognate with the globe of\r\nthe earth; less infested & spoiled by foreign blemish; less confused with\r\nthe outgrowths of earth's surface, & less debased by corrupt products. And\r\nfor this reason Aristotle in the fourth book of his _Meteora_ seems not\r\nunfairly to separate iron from all the rest of the metals. Gold, he says,\r\nsilver, copper, tin, lead, belong to water; but iron is of the earth.\r\nGalen, in the fourth chapter of _De Facultatibus Simplicium\r\nMedicamentorum_, says that iron is an earthy & dense body. Accordingly a\r\nstrong loadstone is on our showing especially of the earth: the next place\r\nis occupied by iron ore or weaker loadstone; so the loadstone is by nature\r\nand origin[102]** of iron, and it and magnetick iron are both one in kind.\r\nIron ore yields iron in furnaces; loadstone also pours forth iron in the\r\nfurnaces, but of a much more excellent sort, that which is called steel or\r\nblade-edge; and the better sort of iron ore is a weak loadstone, the best\r\nloadstone being a most excellent ore of iron, in which, as is to be shown\r\nby us, the primary properties are grand and conspicuous. Weaker loadstone\r\nor iron ore is that in which these properties are more obscure, feeble, and\r\nare scarce perceptible to the senses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nThat the globe of the earth is magnetick, & a magnet; &\r\n_how in our hands the magnet stone has all the primary_\r\nforces of the earth, while the earth by the\r\n_same powers remains constant in a\r\nfixed direction in the\r\nuniverse._\r\n\r\nPrior to bringing forward the causes of magnetical motions, & laying open\r\nthe proofs of things hidden for so many ages, & our experiments (the true\r\nfoundations of terrestrial philosophy), we have to establish & present to\r\nthe view of the learned our New & unheard of doctrine about the earth; and\r\nthis, when argued by us on the grounds of its probability, with subsequent\r\n{40} experiments & proofs, will be as certainly assured as anything in\r\nphilosophy ever has been considered & confirmed by clever arguments or\r\nmathematical proofs. The terrene mass, which together with the vasty ocean\r\nproduces the sphærick figure & constitutes our globe, being of a firm &\r\nconstant substance, is not easily changed, does not wander about, &\r\nfluctuate with uncertain motions, like the seas, & flowing waves: but holds\r\nall its volume of moisture in certain beds & bounds, & as it were in\r\noft-met veins, that it may be the less diffused & dissipated at random. Yet\r\nthe solid magnitude of the earth prevails & reigns supreme in the nature of\r\nour globe. Water, however, is attached to it, & as an appendage only, & a\r\nflux emanating from it; whose force from the beginning is conjoined with\r\nthe earth through its smallest parts, and is innate in its substance. This\r\nmoisture the earth as it grows hot throws off freely when it is of the\r\ngreatest possible service in the generation of things. But the thews and\r\ndominant stuff of the globe is that terrene body which far exceeds in\r\nquantity all the volume of flowing streams and open waters (whatever vulgar\r\nphilosophers may dream of the magnitudes and proportions of their\r\nelements), and which takes up most of the whole globe and almost fills it\r\ninternally, and by itself almost suffices to endow it with sphærick shape.\r\nFor the seas only fill certain not very deep or profound hollows, since\r\nthey rarely go down to a depth of a mile and generally do not exceed a\r\nhundred or 50 fathoms. For so it is ascertained by the observations of\r\nseamen when by the plumb-line and sinker its abysms are explored with the\r\nnautical sounder; which depths relatively to the dimensions of the globe,\r\ndo not much deform its globular shape. Small then appears to be that\r\nportion of the real earth that ever emerges to be seen by man, or is turned\r\nup; since we cannot penetrate deeper into its bowels, further than the\r\nwreckage of its outer efflorescence, either by reason of the waters which\r\ngush up in deep workings, as through veins, or for want of a wholesome air\r\nto support life in the miners, or on account of the vast cost that would be\r\nincurred in pumping out such huge workings[103], and many other\r\ndifficulties; so that to have gone down to a depth of four hundred, or\r\n(which is of rarest occurrence) of five hundred fathoms[104] as in a few\r\nmines, appears to all a stupendous undertaking. But it is easy to\r\nunderstand how minute, how almost negligibly small a portion that 500\r\nfathoms is of the earth's diameter, which is 6,872 miles. It is then parts\r\nonly of the earth's circumference and of its prominences that are perceived\r\nby us with our senses; and these in all regions appear to us to be either\r\nloamy, or clayey, or sandy, or full of various soils, or marls: or lots of\r\nstones or gravel meet us, or beds of salt, or a metallick lode, and metals\r\nin abundance. In the sea and in deep waters, however, either reefs, and\r\nhuge boulders, or smaller stones, or sands, or mud {41} are found by\r\nmariners as they sound the depths. Nowhere does the Aristotelian element of\r\n_earth_ come to light; and the Peripateticks are the sport of their own\r\nvain dreams about elements. Yet the lower bulk of the earth and the inward\r\nparts of the globe consist of such bodies; for they could not have existed,\r\nunless they had been related to and exposed to the air and water, and to\r\nthe light and influences of the heavenly bodies, in like manner as they are\r\ngenerated, and pass into many dissimilar forms of things, and are changed\r\nby a perpetual law of succession. Yet the interior parts imitate them, and\r\nbetake themselves to their own source, on the principle of terrene matter,\r\nalbeit they have lost the first qualities and the natural terrene form, and\r\nare borne towards the earth's centre, and cohære with the globe of the\r\nearth, from which they cannot be wrenched asunder except by force. But the\r\nloadstone and all magneticks, not the stone only, but every magnetick\r\nhomogenic substance, would seem to contain the virtue of the earth's core\r\nand of its inmost bowels, and to hold within itself and to have conceived\r\nthat which is the secret and inward principle of its substance; and it\r\npossesses the actions peculiar to the globe of attracting, directing,\r\ndisposing, rotating, stationing itself in the universe, according to the\r\nrule of the whole, and it contains and regulates the dominant powers of the\r\nglobe; which are the chief tokens and proofs of a certain distinguishing\r\ncombination, and of a nature most thoroughly conjoint. For if among actual\r\nbodies one sees something move and breathe, and experience sensations, and\r\nbe inclined and impelled by reason, will one not, knowing and seeing this,\r\nconclude that it is a man or something rather like a man, than that it is a\r\nstone or a stick? The loadstone far excels all other bodies known to us in\r\nvirtues and properties pertaining to the common mother: but those\r\nproperties have been far too little understood or realized by philosophers:\r\nfor to its body bodies magnetical rush in from all sides and cleave to it,\r\nas we see them do in the case of the earth. It has poles, not mathematical\r\npoints, but natural termini of force excelling in primary efficiency by the\r\nco-operation of the whole: and there are poles in like manner in the earth\r\nwhich our forefathers sought ever in the sky: it has an æquator, a natural\r\ndividing line between the two poles, just as the earth has: for of all\r\nlines drawn by the mathematicians on the terrestrial globe, the æquator is\r\nthe natural boundary, and is not, as will hereafter appear, merely a\r\nmathematical circle. It, like the earth, acquires Direction and stability\r\ntoward North and South, as the earth does; also it has a circular motion\r\ntoward the position of the earth, wherein it adjusts itself to its rule: it\r\nfollows the ascensions and declinations of the earth's poles, and conforms\r\nexactly to the same, and by itself raises its own poles above the {42}\r\nhorizon naturally according to the law of the particular country and\r\nregion, or sinks below it. The loadstone derives temporary properties, and\r\nacquires its verticity from the earth, and iron is affected by the\r\nverticity of the globe even as iron is by a loadstone: Magneticks are\r\nconformable to and are regulated by the earth, and are subject to the earth\r\nin all their motions. All its movements harmonize with, and strictly wait\r\nupon, the geometry and form of the earth, as we shall afterwards prove by\r\nmost conclusive experiments and diagrams; and the chief part of the visible\r\nearth is also magnetical, and has magnetick motions, although it be\r\ndisfigured by corruptions and mutations without end. Why then do we not\r\nrecognize this the chief homogenic substance of the earth, likest of\r\nsubstances to its inner nature and closest allied to its very marrow? For\r\nnone of the other mixed earths suitable for agriculture, no other\r\nmetalliferous veins, nor stones, nor sand, nor other fragments of the earth\r\nwhich have come to our view possess such constant and peculiar powers. And\r\nyet we do not assume that the whole interior of this globe of ours is\r\ncomposed of stones or iron (although Franciscus Maurolycus, that learned\r\nman, deems the whole of the earth's interior to consist of solid stone).\r\nFor not every loadstone that we have is a stone, it being sometimes like a\r\nclod, or like clay and iron either firmly compacted together out of various\r\nmaterials, or of a softer composition, or by heat reduced to the metallick\r\nstate; and the magnetick substance by reason of its location and of its\r\nsurroundings, and of the metallick matrix itself, is distinguished, at the\r\nsurface of the terrene mass, by many qualities and adventitious natures,\r\njust as in clay it is marked by certain stones and iron lodes. But we\r\nmaintain that the true earth is a solid substance, homogeneous with the\r\nglobe, closely coherent, endowed with a primordial and (as in the other\r\nglobes of the universe) with a prepotent form; in which position it\r\npersists with a fixed verticity, and revolves with a necessary motion and\r\nan inherent tendency to turn, and it is this constitution, when true and\r\nnative, and not injured or disfigured by outward defects, that the\r\nloadstone possesses above all bodies apparent to us, as if it were a more\r\ntruly homogenic part taken from the earth. Accordingly native iron which\r\n_sui generis_ (as metallurgists term it), is formed when homogenic parts of\r\nthe earth grow together into a metallick lode; Loadstone being formed when\r\nthey are changed into metallick stone, or a lode of the finest iron, or\r\nsteel: so in other iron lodes the homogenic matter that goes together is\r\nsomewhat more imperfect; just as many parts of the earth, even the high\r\nground, is homogenic but so much more deformate. Smelted iron is fused and\r\nsmelted out of homogenic stuffs, and cleaves to the earth more tenaciously\r\nthan the ores themselves. Such then is our earth in its {43} inward parts,\r\npossessed of a magnetick homogeneal nature, and upon such more perfect\r\nfoundations as these rests the whole nature of things terrestrial,\r\nmanifesting itself to us, in our more diligent scrutiny, everywhere in all\r\nmagnetick minerals, and iron ores, in all clay, and in numerous earths and\r\nstones; while Aristotle's simple element, that most empty terrestrial\r\nphantom of the Peripateticks, a rude, inert, cold, dry, simple matter, the\r\nuniversal substratum, is dead, devoid of vigour, and has never presented\r\nitself to any one, not even in sleep, and would be of no potency in nature.\r\nOur philosophers were only dreaming when they spoke of a kind of simple and\r\ninert matter. Cardan does not consider the loadstone to be any kind of\r\nstone, \"but a sort of perfected portion of some kind of earth that is\r\nabsolute; a token of which is its abundance, there being no place where it\r\nis not found. And there is\" (he says) \"a power of iron in the wedded Earth\r\nwhich is perfect in its own kind when it has received fertilizing force\r\nfrom the male, that is to say, the stone of Hercules\" (in his book _De\r\nProportionibus_). And later: \"Because\" (he says) \"in the previous\r\nproposition I have taught that iron is true earth.\" A strong loadstone\r\nshows itself to be of the inward earth, and upon innumerable tests claims\r\nto rank with the earth in the possession of a primary form, that by which\r\nEarth herself abides in her own station and is directed in her courses.\r\nThus a weaker loadstone and every ore of iron, and nearly all clay, or\r\nclayey earth, and numerous other sorts (yet more, or less, owing to the\r\ndifferent labefaction of fluids and slimes), keep their magnetick and\r\ngenuine earth-properties open to view, falling short of the characteristic\r\nform, and deformate. For it is not iron alone (the smelted metal) that\r\npoints to the poles, nor is it the loadstone alone that is attracted by\r\nanother and made to revolve magnetically; but all iron ores, and other\r\nstones, as Rhenish slates and the black ones from Avignon (the French call\r\nthem _Ardoises_) which they use for tiles, and many more of other colours\r\nand substances, provided they have been prepared; as well as all clay,\r\ngrit[105], and some sorts of rocks, and, to speak more clearly, all the\r\nmore solid earth that is everywhere apparent; given that that earth be not\r\nfouled with fatty and fluid corruptions; as mud, as mire, as accumulations\r\nof putrid matter; nor deformate by the imperfections of sundry admixtures;\r\nnor dripping with ooze, as marls; all are attracted by the loadstone, when\r\nsimply prepared by fire, and freed from their refuse humour; and as by the\r\nloadstone so also by the earth herself they are drawn and controlled\r\nmagnetically, in a way different from all other bodies; and by that\r\ninherent force settle themselves according to the orderly arrangement and\r\nfabric of the universe and of the Earth, as will appear {44} later. Thus\r\nevery part of the earth which is removed from it exhibits by sure\r\nexperiments every impulse of the magnetick nature; by its various motions\r\nit observes the globe of the earth and the principle common to both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{45} [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBOOK SECOND.\r\n\r\n_CHAP. I._\r\n\r\nON MAGNETICK\r\nMotions.\r\n\r\nDivers things concerning opinions about the magnet-stone, and its variety,\r\nconcerning its poles and its known faculties, concerning iron, concerning\r\nthe properties of iron, concerning a magnetick substance common to both of\r\nthese and to the earth itself, have been spoken briefly by us in the former\r\nbook. There remain the magnetical motions, and their fuller philosophy,\r\nshown and demonstrated. These motions are incitements of homogeneal parts\r\neither among themselves or toward the primary conformation of the whole\r\nearth. Aristotle admits only two simple motions of his elements, from the\r\ncentre and toward the centre; of light ones upward, heavy ones downward; so\r\nthat in the earth there exists one motion only of all its parts towards the\r\ncentre of the world,--a rude and inert precipitation. But what of it is\r\nlight, and how wrongly it is inferred by the Peripateticks from the simple\r\nmotion of the elements, and also what is its heavy part, we will discuss\r\nelsewhere. But now our inquiry must be into the causes of other motions,\r\ndepending on its true form, which we have plainly seen in our magnetick\r\nbodies; and these we have seen to be present in the earth and in all its\r\nhomogenic parts also. We have noticed that they harmonize with the earth,\r\nand are bound up with its forces. Five movements[106] or differences of\r\nmotions are then observed by us: Coition (commonly called attraction), the\r\n{46} incitement to magnetick union; Direction towards the poles of the\r\nearth, and the verticity and continuance of the earth towards the\r\ndeterminate poles of the world; Variation, a deflexion from the meridian,\r\nwhich we call a perverted movement; Declination, a descent of the magnetick\r\npole below the horizon; and circular motion, or Revolution. Concerning all\r\nthese we shall discuss separately, and how they all proceed from a nature\r\ntending to aggregation, either by verticity or by volubility. Jofrancus\r\nOffusius[107] makes out different magnetick motions; a first toward a\r\ncentre; a second toward a pole at seventy-seven degrees; a third toward\r\niron; a fourth toward loadstone. The first is not always to a centre, but\r\nexists only at the poles in a straight course toward the centre, if the\r\nmotion is magnetick; otherwise it is only motion of matter toward its own\r\nmass and toward the globe. The second toward a pole at seventy-seven\r\ndegrees is no motion, but is direction with respect to the pole of the\r\nearth, or variation. The third and fourth are magnetick and are the same.\r\nSo he truly recognizes no magnetick motion except the Coition toward iron\r\nor loadstone, commonly called attraction. There is another motion in the\r\nwhole earth, which does not exist towards the terrella or towards its\r\nparts; videlicet, a motion of aggregation, and that movement of matter,\r\nwhich is called by philosophers a right motion, of which elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nOn the Magnetick Coition, and first on the\r\nAttraction of Amber, or more truly, on the\r\n_Attaching of Bodies to Amber_.\r\n\r\nCelebrated has the fame of the loadstone and of amber ever been in the\r\nmemoirs of the learned. Loadstone and also amber do some philosophers\r\ninvoke when in explaining many secrets their senses become dim and\r\nreasoning cannot go further. Inquisitive theologians also would throw light\r\non the divine mysteries set beyond the range of human sense, by means of\r\nloadstone and amber; just as idle Metaphysicians, when they are setting up\r\nand teaching useless phantasms, have recourse to the loadstone as if it\r\nwere a Delphick sword, an illustration always applicable to everything. But\r\nphysicians even (with the authority of {47} Galen), desiring to confirm the\r\nbelief in the attraction of purgative medicines by means of the likeness of\r\nsubstance and the familiarities of the juices--truly a vain and useless\r\nerror--bring in the loadstone as witness as being a nature of great\r\nauthority and of conspicuous efficacy and a remarkable body. So in very\r\nmany cases there are some who, when they are pleading a cause and cannot\r\ngive a reason for it, bring in loadstone and amber as though they were\r\npersonified witnesses. But these men (apart from that common error) being\r\nignorant that the causes of magnetical motions are widely different from\r\nthe forces of amber, easily fall into error, and are themselves the more\r\ndeceived by their own cogitations. For in other bodies a conspicuous force\r\nof attraction manifests itself otherwise than in loadstone; like as in\r\namber, concerning which some things must first be said, that it may appear\r\nwhat is that attaching of bodies, and how it is different from and foreign\r\nto the magnetical actions; those mortals being still ignorant, who think\r\nthat inclination to be an attraction, and compare it with the magnetick\r\ncoitions. The Greeks call it [Greek: êlektron][108] because it attracts\r\nstraws to itself, when it is warmed by rubbing; then it is called [Greek:\r\nharpax][109]; and [Greek: chrusophoron] from its golden colour. But the\r\nMoors call it Carabe[110], because they are accustomed to offer the same in\r\nsacrifices and in the worship of the Gods. For Carab signifies to offer in\r\nArabic; so Carabe, an offering: or seizing chaff, as Scaliger quotes from\r\nAbohalis, out of the Arabic or Persian language. Some also call it Amber,\r\nespecially the Indian and Ethiopian amber, called in Latin _Succinum_, as\r\nif it were a juice[111]. The Sudavienses or Sudini[112] call it _geniter_,\r\nas though it were generated terrestrially. The errors of the ancients\r\nconcerning its nature and origin having been exploded, it is certain that\r\namber comes for the most part from the sea, and the rustics collect it on\r\nthe coast after the more violent storms, with nets and other tackle; as\r\namong the Sudini of Prussia; and it is also found sometimes on the coast of\r\nour own Britain. It seems, however, to be produced also in the soil and at\r\nspots of some depth, like other bitumens; to be washed out by the waves of\r\nthe sea; and to become concreted more firmly from the nature and saltness\r\nof the sea-water. For it was at first a soft and viscous material;\r\nwherefore also it contains enclosed and entombed in pieces of it, shining\r\nin eternal sepulchres, flies, grubs, gnats, ants; which have all flown or\r\ncrept or fallen into it when it first flowed forth in a liquid state[113].\r\nThe ancients and also more recent writers recall (experience proving the\r\nsame thing), that amber attracts straws and chaff[114]. The same is also\r\ndone by jet[115], which is dug out of the earth in Britain, in Germany, and\r\nin very many lands, and is a rather hard concretion from black bitumen, and\r\nas it were a transformation into stone. There are many modern authors[116]\r\nwho have written and copied from others about amber and jet[117] attracting\r\nchaff, and about other {48} substances generally unknown; with whose\r\nlabours the shops of booksellers are crammed. Our own age has produced many\r\nbooks about hidden, abstruse, and occult causes and wonders, in all of\r\nwhich amber and jet are set forth as enticing chaff; but they treat the\r\nsubject in words alone, without finding any reasons or proofs from\r\nexperiments, their very statements obscuring the thing in a greater fog,\r\nforsooth in a cryptic, marvellous, abstruse, secret, occult, way. Wherefore\r\nalso such philosophy produces no fruit, because very many philosophers,\r\nmaking no investigation themselves, unsupported by any practical\r\nexperience, idle and inert, make no progress by their records, and do not\r\nsee what light they can bring to their theories; but their philosophy rests\r\nsimply on the use of certain Greek words, or uncommon ones; after the\r\nmanner of our gossips and barbers nowadays, who make show of certain Latin\r\nwords to an ignorant populace as the insignia of their craft, and snatch at\r\nthe popular favour. For it is not only amber and * jet (as they suppose)\r\nwhich entice small bodies[118]; but Diamond, Sapphire, Carbuncle, Iris\r\ngem[119], Opal, Amethyst, Vincentina, and Bristolla (an English gem or\r\nspar)[120], Beryl, and Crystal[121] do the same. Similar powers of\r\nattraction are seen also to be possessed by glass (especially when clear\r\nand lucid), as also by false gems made of glass or Crystal, by glass of\r\nantimony, and by many kinds of spars from the mines, and by Belemnites.\r\nSulphur also attracts, and mastick, and hard sealing-wax[122] compounded of\r\nlac tinctured of various colours. Rather hard resin entices, as does\r\norpiment[123], but less strongly; with difficulty also and indistinctly\r\nunder a suitable dry sky[124], Rock salt, muscovy stone, and rock alum.\r\nThis one may see when the air is sharp and clear and rare in mid-winter,\r\nwhen the emanations from the earth hinder electricks less, and the\r\nelectrick bodies become * more firmly indurated; about which hereafter.\r\nThese substances draw everything, not straws and chaff only[125], but all\r\nmetals, woods, leaves, stones, earths, even water and oil, and everything\r\nwhich is subject to our senses, or is solid; although some write that amber\r\ndoes not attract anything but chaff and certain twigs; (wherefore Alexander\r\nAphrodiseus falsely declares the question of amber to be inexplicable,\r\nbecause it attracts dry chaff only, and not basil leaves[126]), but these\r\nare the utterly false and disgraceful tales of the writers. But in order\r\nthat you may be able clearly to test how such attraction occurs[127], and\r\nwhat those materials[128] are which thus entice other bodies (for even if\r\nbodies incline towards some of these, yet on account of weakness they seem\r\nnot to be raised by them, but are more easily turned), make yourself a\r\nversorium of any metal you like, three or four digits in length, resting\r\nrather lightly on its point of support after the manner of a magnetick\r\nneedle, to one end of which bring up a piece of amber or a smooth {49}\r\n[Illustration] and polished gem which has been gently rubbed; for the\r\nversorium turns forthwith. Many things are thereby seen to attract, both\r\nthose which are formed by nature alone, and those which are by art\r\nprepared, fused, and mixed; nor is this so much a singular property of one\r\nor two things (as is commonly supposed), but the manifest nature of very\r\nmany, both of simple substances, remaining merely in their own form, and of\r\ncompositions, as of hard sealing-wax, & of certain other mixtures besides,\r\nmade of unctuous stuffs. We must, however, investigate more fully whence\r\nthat tendency arises, and what those forces be, concerning which a few men\r\nhave brought forward very little, the crowd of philosophizers nothing at\r\nall. By Galen three kinds of attractives in general were recognized in\r\nnature: a First class of those substances which attract by their elemental\r\nquality, namely, heat; the Second is the class of those which attract by\r\nthe succession of a vacuum; the Third is the class of those which attract\r\nby a property of their whole substance, which are also quoted by Avicenna\r\nand others. These classes, however, cannot in any way satisfy us; they\r\nneither embrace the causes of amber, jet, and diamond, and of other similar\r\nsubstances (which derive their forces on account of the same virtue); nor\r\nof the loadstone, and of all magnetick substances, which obtain their\r\nvirtue by a very dissimilar and alien influence from them, derived from\r\nother sources. Wherefore also it is fitting that we find other causes of\r\nthe motions, or else we must wander (as in darkness), with these men, and\r\nin no way reach the goal. Amber truly does* not allure by heat, since if\r\nwarmed by fire and brought near straws, it does not attract them, whether\r\nit be tepid, or hot, or glowing, or even when forced into the flame. Cardan\r\n(as also Pictorio) reckons that this happens in no different way[129] than\r\nwith the cupping-glass, by the force of fire. Yet the attracting force of\r\nthe cupping-glass does not really come from the force of fire. But he had\r\npreviously said that the dry substance wished to imbibe fatty humour, and\r\ntherefore it was borne towards it. But these statements are at variance\r\nwith one another, and also foreign to reason. For if amber had moved\r\ntowards its food, or if other bodies had inclined towards amber as towards\r\nprovender, there would have been a diminution of the one which was\r\ndevoured, just as there would have been a growth of the other which was\r\nsated. Then why should an attractive force of fire be looked for in amber?\r\nIf the attraction existed from heat, why should not very many other bodies\r\nalso attract, if warmed by fire, by the sun, or by friction? Neither can\r\nthe attraction be on account of the dissipating of the air, when it takes\r\nplace in open air (yet Lucretius the poet adduces this as the reason for\r\nmagnetical motions). Nor in the cupping-glass can heat or fire attract by\r\nfeeding on air: in the cupping-glass air, having been exhausted into flame,\r\n{50} when it condenses again and is forced into a narrow space, makes the\r\nskin and flesh rise in avoiding a vacuum. In the open air warm things\r\ncannot attract, not metals even or stones, if they should * be strongly\r\nincandescent by fire. For a rod of glowing iron, or a flame, or a candle,\r\nor a blazing torch, or a live coal, when they are brought near to straws,\r\nor to a versorium, do not attract; yet at the same time they manifestly\r\ncall in the air in succession; because they consume it, as lamps do oil.\r\nBut concerning heat, how it is reckoned by the crowd of philosophizers, in\r\nnatural philosophy and in _materia medica_ to exert an attraction otherwise\r\nthan nature allows, to which true attractions are falsely imputed, we will\r\ndiscuss more at length elsewhere, when we shall determine what are the\r\nproperties of heat and cold. They are very general qualities or kinships of\r\na substance, and yet are not to be assigned as true causes, and, if I may\r\nsay so, those philosophizers utter some resounding words; but about the\r\nthing itself prove nothing in particular. Nor does this attraction\r\naccredited to amber arise from any singular quality of the substance or\r\nkinship, since by more thorough research we find the same effect in very\r\nmany other bodies; and all bodies, moreover, of whatever quality, are\r\nallured by all those bodies. Similarity also is not the cause; because all\r\nthings around us placed on this globe of the earth, similar and dissimilar,\r\nare allured by amber and bodies of this kind; and on that account no cogent\r\nanalogy is to be drawn either from similarity or identity of substance. But\r\nneither do similars mutually attract one another, as stone stone, flesh\r\nflesh, nor aught else outside the class of magneticks and electricks.\r\nFracastorio would have it that \"things which mutually attract one another\r\nare similars, as being of the same species, either in action or in right\r\nsubjection. Right subjection is that from which is emitted the emanation\r\nwhich attracts and which in mixtures often lies hidden on account of their\r\nlack of form, by reason of which they are often different in act from what\r\nthey are in potency. Hence it may be that hairs and twigs move towards\r\namber and towards diamond, not because they are hairs, but because either\r\nthere is shut up in them air or some other principle, which is attracted in\r\nthe first place, and which bears some relation and analogy to that which\r\nattracts of itself; in which diamond and amber agree through a principle\r\ncommon to each.\" Thus far Fracastorio. Who if he had observed by a large\r\nnumber of experiments that all bodies are drawn to electricks except those\r\nwhich are aglow and aflame, and highly rarefied, would never have given a\r\nthought to such things. It is easy for men of acute intellect, apart from\r\nexperiments and practice, to slip and err. In greater error do they remain\r\nsunk who maintain these same substances to be not similar, but to be\r\nsubstances near akin; and hold that on that account a thing moves towards\r\nanother, its like, by which it is brought to more perfection. But these are\r\n{51} ill-considered views; for towards all electricks all things move[130]\r\nexcept such as are aflame or are too highly rarefied, as air, which is the\r\nuniversal effluvium of this globe and of the world. Vegetable substances\r\ndraw moisture by which their shoots are rejoiced and grow; from analogy\r\nwith that, however, Hippocrates, in his _De Natura Hominis_, Book I.,\r\nwrongly concluded that the purging of morbid humour took place by the\r\nspecifick force of the drug. Concerning the action and potency of\r\npurgatives we shall speak elsewhere. Wrongly also is attraction inferred in\r\nother effects; as in the case of a flagon full of water, when buried in a\r\nheap of wheat, although well stoppered, the moisture is drawn out; since\r\nthis moisture is rather resolved into vapour by the emanation of the\r\nfermenting wheat, and the wheat imbibes the freed vapour. Nor do elephants'\r\ntusks attract moisture, but drive it into vapour or absorb it. Thus then\r\nvery many things are said to attract, the reasons for whose energy must be\r\nsought from other causes. Amber in a fairly large mass allures, if* it is\r\npolished; in a smaller mass or less pure it seems not to attract without\r\nfriction. But very many electricks (as precious stones and some other\r\nsubstances) do not attract at all unless rubbed. On the other hand many\r\ngems, as well as other bodies, are polished, yet do* not allure, and by no\r\namount of friction are they aroused; thus the emerald, agate, carnelian,\r\npearls, jasper, chalcedony, alabaster, porphyry, coral, the marbles,\r\ntouchstone, flint, bloodstone, emery[131], do not acquire any power; nor do\r\nbones, or ivory, or the hardest woods, as ebony, nor do cedar, juniper, or\r\ncypress; nor do metals, silver, gold, brass, iron, nor any loadstone,\r\nthough many of them are finely polished and shine. But on the other hand\r\nthere are some other polished substances of which we have spoken before,\r\ntoward which, when they have been rubbed, bodies incline. This we shall\r\nunderstand only when we have more closely looked into the prime origin of\r\nbodies. It is plain to all, and all admit, that the mass of the earth, or\r\nrather the structure and crust of the earth, consists of a twofold\r\nmaterial, namely, of fluid and humid matter, and of material of more\r\nconsistency and dry. From this twofold nature or the more simple compacting\r\nof one, various substances take their rise among us, which originate in\r\ngreater proportion now from the earthy, now from the aqueous nature. Those\r\nsubstances which have received their chief growth from moisture, whether\r\naqueous or fatty, or have taken on their form by a simpler compacting from\r\nthem, or have been compacted from these same materials in long ages, if\r\nthey have a sufficiently firm hardness, if rubbed after they have been\r\npolished and when they remain bright with the friction--towards those\r\nsubstances everything, if presented to them in the air, turns, if its too\r\nheavy weight does not prevent it. For amber has been compacted of moisture,\r\nand jet also. Lucid gems are made of water; just as Crystal[132], which has\r\nbeen concreted from clear water, not {52} always by a very great cold, as\r\nsome used to judge, and by very hard frost, but sometimes by a less severe\r\none, the nature of the soil fashioning it, the humour or juices being shut\r\nup in definite cavities, in the way in which spars are produced in mines.\r\nSo clear glass is fused out of sand, and from other substances, which have\r\ntheir origin in humid juices. But the dross of metals, as also metals,\r\nstones, rocks, woods, contain earth rather, or are mixed with a good deal\r\nof earth; * and therefore they do not attract. Crystal, mica, glass, and\r\nall electricks do not attract if they are burnt or roasted; for their\r\nprimordial supplies of moisture perish by heat, and are changed and\r\nexhaled. All things therefore which have sprung from a predominant moisture\r\nand are firmly concreted, and retain the appearance of spar and its\r\nresplendent nature in a firm and compact body, allure all bodies, whether\r\nhumid or dry. Those, however, which partake of the true earth-substance or\r\nare very little different from it, are seen to attract also, but from a far\r\ndifferent reason, and (so to say) magnetically; concerning these we intend\r\nto speak afterwards. But those substances which are more mixed of water and\r\nearth, and are produced by the equal degradation of each element (in which\r\nthe magnetick force of the earth is deformed and remains buried; while the\r\nwatery humour, being fouled by joining with a more plentiful supply of\r\nearth, has not concreted in itself but is mingled with earthy matter), can\r\nin no way of themselves attract or move from its place anything which they\r\ndo not touch. On this account metals, marbles, flints, woods, herbs, flesh,\r\nand very many other things can neither allure nor solicit any body either\r\nmagnetically or electrically. (For it pleases us to call that an electrick\r\nforce, which hath * its origin from the humour.) But substances consisting\r\nmostly of humour, and which are not very firmly compacted by nature\r\n(whereby do they neither bear rubbing, but either melt down and become\r\nsoft, or are not levigable, such as pitch, the softer kinds of resin,\r\ncamphor, galbanum, ammoniack[133], storax, asafoetida, benzoin, asphaltum,\r\nespecially in rather warm weather) towards them small bodies are not borne;\r\nfor without rubbing most electricks do not * emit their peculiar and native\r\nexhalation and effluvium. The resin turpentine when liquid does not\r\nattract; for it cannot be rubbed; but if it has hardened into a mastick it\r\ndoes attract. But now at length we must understand why small bodies turn\r\ntowards those substances which have drawn their origin from water; by what\r\nforce and with what hands (so to speak) electricks seize upon kindred\r\nnatures. In all bodies in the world two causes or principles have been laid\r\ndown, from which the bodies themselves were produced, matter and form[134].\r\nElectrical motions become strong from matter, but magnetick from form\r\nchiefly; and they differ widely from one another and turn out unlike, since\r\nthe one is ennobled by numerous virtues and is prepotent; the other is\r\nignoble and of less potency, and {53} mostly restrained, as it were, within\r\ncertain barriers; and therefore that force must at times be aroused by\r\nattrition or friction, until it is at a dull heat and gives off an\r\neffluvium and a polish is induced on the body. For spent air, either blown\r\nout of the mouth or given* off from moister air, chokes the virtue. If\r\nindeed either a sheet of paper or a piece of linen be interposed, there\r\nwill be no movement. But a loadstone, without friction or heat, whether dry\r\nor suffused with moisture, as well in air as in water, invites magneticks,\r\neven with the most solid bodies interposed, even planks of wood or pretty\r\nthick slabs of stone or sheets of metal. A loadstone appeals to magneticks*\r\nonly; towards electricks all things move. A loadstone[135] raises great\r\nweights; so that if there is a loadstone weighing two ounces and strong, it\r\nattracts half an ounce or a whole ounce. An electrical substance only\r\nattracts very small weights; as, for instance, a piece of amber of three\r\nounces weight, when rubbed, scarce raises a fourth part of a grain of\r\nbarley. But this attraction of amber and of electrical substances must be\r\nfurther investigated; and since there is this particular affection of\r\nmatter, it may be asked why is amber rubbed, and what affection is produced\r\nby the rubbing, and what causes arise which make it lay hold on everything?\r\nAs a result of friction it grows slightly warm and becomes smooth; two\r\nresults which must often occur together. A large polished fragment of amber\r\nor jet attracts indeed, even without friction, but less strongly; but if it\r\nbe brought gently near a flame or a live coal, so that it equally becomes\r\nwarm, it does not attract small bodies because* it is enveloped in a cloud\r\nfrom the body of the flaming substance, which emits a hot breath, and then\r\nimpinges upon it vapour from a foreign body which for the most part is at\r\nvariance with the nature of amber. Moreover the spirit of the amber which\r\nis called forth is enfeebled by alien heat; wherefore it ought not to have\r\nheat excepting that produced by motion only and friction, and, as it were,\r\nits own, not sent into it by other bodies. For as the igneous heat emitted\r\nfrom any burning substance cannot be so used that electricks may acquire\r\ntheir force from it; so also heat from the solar rays does not fit an\r\nelectrick by the loosening of its* right material, because it dissipates\r\nrather and consumes it (albeit a body which has been rubbed retains its\r\nvirtue longer exposed to the rays of the sun than in the shade; because in\r\nthe shade the effluvia are condensed to a greater degree and more quickly).\r\nThen again the fervour from the light of the Sun aroused by means of a*\r\nburning mirror confers no vigour on the heated amber[136]; indeed it\r\ndissipates and corrupts all the electrick effluvia. Again, burning* sulphur\r\nand hard wax, made from shell-lac, when aflame do not allure; for heat from\r\nfriction resolves bodies into effluvia, which flame consumes away. For it\r\nis impossible for solid electricks to be resolved into their own true\r\neffluvia otherwise than by attrition, save {54} in the case of certain\r\nsubstances which by reason of innate vigour emit effluvia constantly. They\r\nare rubbed with bodies which do not befoul their surface, and which produce\r\na polish, as pretty stiff silk or a rough wool rag which is as little\r\nsoiled as possible, or the dry palm. Amber also is rubbed with amber, with\r\ndiamond, and with glass, and numerous other substances. Thus are electricks\r\nmanipulated. These things being so, what is it which moves? Is it the body\r\nitself, inclosed within its own circumference? Or is it something\r\nimperceptible to us, which flows out from the substance into the ambient\r\nair? Somewhat as Plutarch opines, saying in his _Quæstiones\r\nPlatonicæ_[137]: That there is in amber something flammable or something\r\nhaving the nature of breath, and this by the attrition of the surface being\r\nemitted from its relaxed pores attracts bodies. And if it be an effusion\r\ndoes it seize upon the air whose motion the bodies follow, or upon the\r\nbodies themselves? But if amber allured the body itself, then what need\r\nwere there of friction, if it is bare and smooth? Nor does the force arise\r\nfrom the light which is reflected from a smooth and polished body; for a\r\nGem of Vincent's rock[138], Diamond, and clear glass, attract when they are\r\nrough; but not so powerfully and quickly, because they are not so readily\r\ncleansed from extraneous moisture on the surface, and are not rubbed\r\nequally so as to be copiously resolved at that part. Nor does the sun by\r\nits own beams of light and its rays, which are of capital importance in\r\nnature, attract bodies in this way; and yet the herd of philosophizers\r\nconsiders that humours are attracted by the sun, when it is only denser\r\nhumours that are being turned into thinner, into spirit and air; and so by\r\nthe motion of effusion they ascend into the upper regions, or the\r\nattenuated exhalations are raised up from the denser air. Nor does it seem\r\nto take place from the effluvia attenuating the air, so that bodies\r\nimpelled by the denser air penetrate towards the source of the rarefaction;\r\nin this case both hot and flaming bodies would also allure other bodies;\r\nbut not even the lightest chaff, or any versorium moves towards a flame. If\r\nthere is a flow and rush of air towards the body, how can a small diamond\r\nof the size of a pea[139] summon towards itself so much air, that it seizes\r\nhold of a biggish long body placed in equilibrio (the air about one or\r\nother very small part of an end being attracted)? It ought also to have\r\nslopped or moved more slowly, before it came into contact with the body,\r\nespecially if the piece of amber was rather broad and flat, from the\r\naccumulation of air on the surface of the amber and its flowing back again.\r\nIf it is because the effluvia are thinner, and denser vapours come in\r\nreturn, as in breathing, then the body would rather have had a motion\r\ntoward the electrick a little while after the beginning of the application;\r\nbut when electricks which have been rubbed are applied quickly to *  a\r\nversorium then especially at once they act on the versorium, and it is\r\nattracted more when near them. But if it is because the rarefied {55}\r\neffluvia produce a rarefied medium, and on that account bodies are more\r\nprone to slip down from a denser to a more attenuated medium; they might\r\nhave been carried from the side in this way or downwards, but not to bodies\r\nabove them; or the attraction and apprehension of contiguous bodies would\r\nhave been momentary only. But with a single friction jet and amber draw and\r\nattract bodies to them strongly and for a long time, sometimes for the\r\ntwelfth part of an hour, especially in clear weather. But if the mass of\r\namber be rather large, and the surface polished, it attracts without\r\nfriction. Flint is rubbed and emits by attrition an inflammable matter that\r\nturns into sparks and heat. Therefore the denser effluvia of flint\r\nproducing fire are very far different from electrical effluvia, which on\r\naccount of their extreme attenuation do not take fire, nor are fit material\r\nfor flame. Those effluvia are not of the nature of breath, for when emitted\r\nthey do not propel anything, but are exhaled without sensible resistance\r\nand touch bodies. They are highly attenuated humours much more subtile than\r\nthe ambient air; and in order that they may occur, bodies are required\r\nproduced from humour and concreted with a considerable degree of hardness.\r\nNon-electrick bodies are not resolved into humid effluvia, and those\r\neffluvia mix with the common and general effluvia of the earth, and are not\r\npeculiar. Also besides the attraction of bodies, they retain them longer.\r\nIt is probable therefore that amber does exhale something peculiar to *\r\nitself, which allures bodies themselves, not the intermediate air. Indeed\r\nit plainly does draw the body itself in the case of a spherical drop of\r\nwater standing on a dry surface; for a piece of amber applied to it at a\r\nsuitable distance pulls the nearest parts out of their position and draws\r\nit up into a cone; otherwise, if it were * drawn by means of the air\r\nrushing along, the whole drop would have moved. That it does not attract\r\nthe air is thus demonstrated: take a very thin wax candle, which makes a\r\nvery small and clear flame; bring up to this, within two digits or any\r\nconvenient distance, a piece of amber or jet, a broad flat piece, well\r\nprepared * and skilfully rubbed, such a piece of amber as would attract\r\nbodies far and wide, yet it does not disturb the flame; which of necessity\r\nwould have occurred, if the air was disturbed, for the flame would have\r\nfollowed the current of air. As far as the effluvia are sent out, so far it\r\nallures; but as a body approaches, its motion is accelerated, stronger\r\nforces drawing it; as also in the case of magneticks and in all natural\r\nmotion; not by attenuating or by expelling the air, so that the body moves\r\ndown into the place of the air which has gone out[140]; for thus it would\r\nhave allured only and would not have retained; since it would at first also\r\nhave repelled approaching bodies just as it drives the air itself; but\r\nindeed a particle, be it ever so small, does not avoid the first\r\napplication made very quickly after rubbing. An effluvium exhales from\r\namber and is emitted by rubbing: pearls, carnelian, agate, jasper,\r\nchalcedony, coral, metals, {56} and other substances of that kind, when\r\nthey are rubbed, produce no effect. Is there not also something which is\r\nexhaled from them by heat and attrition? Most truly; but from grosser\r\nbodies more blended with the earthy nature, that which is exhaled is gross\r\nand spent; for even towards very many electricks, if they are rubbed * too\r\nhard, there is produced but a weak attraction of bodies, or none at all;\r\nthe attraction is best when the rubbing has been gentle and very quick; for\r\nso the finest effluvia are evoked. The effluvia arise from the subtile\r\ndiffusion of humour, not from excessive and turbulent violence; especially\r\nin the case of those substances which have been compacted from unctuous\r\nmatter, which when the atmosphere is very thin, when the North winds, and\r\namongst us (English) the East winds, are blowing, have a surer and firmer\r\neffect, but during South winds and in damp weather, only a weak one; so\r\nthat those * substances which attract with difficulty in clear weather, in\r\nthick weather produce no motion at all; both because in grosser air lighter\r\nsubstances move with greater difficulty; and especially because the\r\neffluvia are stifled, and the surface of the body that has been rubbed is\r\naffected by the spent humour of the air, and the effluvia are stopped at\r\ntheir very starting. On that account in the case of amber, jet, and\r\nsulphur, because they do not so easily take up moist air on their surface\r\nand are much more plenteously set free, that force is not so quickly\r\nsuppressed as in gems, crystal, glass, and substances of that kind which\r\ncollect on their surface the moister breath which has grown heavy. But it\r\nmay be asked why does amber allure water, when water placed on its surface\r\nremoves its action? Evidently because it is one thing to suppress it at its\r\nvery start, and quite another to extinguish it when it has been * emitted.\r\nSo also thin and very fine silk, in common language _Sarcenet_, placed\r\nquickly on the amber, after it has been rubbed, * hinders the attraction of\r\nthe body; but if it is interposed in the intervening space, it does not\r\nentirely obstruct it. Moisture also from spent air, and any breath blown\r\nfrom the mouth, as well as water put on the amber, immediately extinguishes\r\nits force. But oil, which is light and pure, does not hinder it; for\r\nalthough amber * be rubbed with a warm finger dipped in oil, still it\r\nattracts. But * if that amber, after the rubbing, is moistened with _aqua\r\nvitæ_ or spirits of wine, it does not attract; for it is heavier than oil,\r\ndenser, and when added to oil sinks beneath it. For oil is light and rare,\r\nand does not resist the most delicate effluvia. A breath therefore,\r\nproceeding from a body which had been compacted from humour or from a\r\nwatery liquid, reaches the body to be attracted; the body that is reached\r\nis united with the attracting body, and the one body lying near the other\r\nwithin the peculiar radius of its effluvia makes one out of two; united,\r\nthey come together into the closest accord, and this is commonly called\r\nattraction. This unity, according to {57} the opinion of Pythagoras, is the\r\nprinciple of all things, and through participation in it each several thing\r\nis said to be one. For since no action can take place by means of matter\r\nunless by contact, these electricks are not seen to touch, but, as was\r\nnecessary, something is sent from the one to the other, something which may\r\ntouch closely and be the beginning of that incitement. All bodies are\r\nunited and, as it were, cemented together in some way by moisture; so that\r\na wet body, when it touches another body, attracts it, if it is small. So\r\nwet bodies on the surface of water attract wet bodies. But the peculiar\r\nelectrical effluvia, which are the most subtile material of diffuse humour,\r\nentice corpuscles. Air (the common effluvium of the earth) not only unites\r\nthe disjointed parts, but the earth calls bodies back to itself by means of\r\nthe intervening air; otherwise bodies which are in higher places would not\r\nso eagerly make for the earth. Electrical effluvia differ greatly from air;\r\nand as air is the effluvium of the earth, so electricks have their own\r\neffluvia and properties, each of them having by reason of its peculiar\r\neffluvia a singular tendency toward unity, a motion toward its origin and\r\nfount, and toward the body emitting the effluvia. But those substances\r\nwhich by attrition emit a gross or vapourous or aeriform effluvium produce\r\nno effect; for either such effluvia are alien to the humour (the uniter of\r\nall things), or being very like common air are blended with the air and\r\nintermingle with the air, wherefore they produce no effect in the air, and\r\ndo not cause motions different from those so universal and common in\r\nnature. In like manner * bodies strive to be united and move on the surface\r\nof water, just [Illustration] as the rod C, which is put a little way under\r\nwater. It is plain that the rod E F, which floats on the water by reason of\r\nthe cork H, and only has its wet end F above the surface of the water, is\r\nattracted by the rod C, if the rod C is wet a little above the surface of\r\nthe water; they are suddenly united, just as a drop adjoining a drop is\r\nattracted. So a wet thing on the surface of water seeks union with a wet\r\nthing, since the surface of the water is raised on both; and they\r\nimmediately flow together, just like drops or bubbles. But they are in much\r\ngreater proximity than electricks, and are united by their clammy natures.\r\nIf, however, the whole rod be dry * above the water, it no longer attracts,\r\nbut drives away the stick E F. The same is seen in those bubbles also which\r\nare made on {58} water. For we see one drive towards another, and the\r\nquicker the nearer they are. Solids are impelled towards solids by the\r\nmedium of liquid: for example, touch the end of a versorium with the end of\r\na rod on which a drop of water is projecting; as soon as the versorium\r\ntouches the top of the droplet, immediately it is joined * strongly by a\r\nswift motion to the body of the rod. So concreted humid things attract when\r\na little resolved into air (the effluvia in the intermediate space tending\r\nto produce unity); for water has on wet bodies, or on bodies wet with\r\nabundant moisture on the top of water, the force of an effluvium. Clear air\r\nis a convenient medium for an electrical effluvium excited from concreted\r\nhumour. Wet bodies projecting above the surface of water (if they are near)\r\nrun together so that they may unite; for the surface of the water is raised\r\naround wet substances. But a dry thing is not impelled to a wet one, nor a\r\nwet to a dry, but seems to run away. For if all is dry above the water, the\r\nsurface of the water close to it does not rise, but shuns it, the wave\r\nsinking around a dry thing. So neither does a wet thing move towards the\r\ndry rim of a vessel; but it seeks [Illustration] a wet rim. A B is the\r\nsurface of the water; C D two rods, which stand up wet above the water; it\r\nis manifest that the surface of the water is raised at C and D along with\r\nthe rods; and therefore the rod C, by reason of the water standing up\r\n(which seeks its level and unity), moves with the water to D. On E, on the\r\nother hand, a wet rod, the water also rises; but on the dry rod F the\r\nsurface is depressed; and as it drives to depress also the wave rising on E\r\nin its neighbourhood, the higher wave at E turns away from F[141]; for it\r\ndoes not suffer itself to be depressed. All electrical attraction occurs\r\nthrough an intervening humour; so it is by reason of humour that all things\r\nmutually come together; fluids indeed and aqueous bodies on the surface of\r\nwater, but concreted things, if they have been resolved into vapour, in\r\nair;--in air indeed, the effluvium of electricks being very rare, that it\r\nmay the better permeate the medium and not impel it by its motion; for if\r\nthat effluvium had been thick, as that of air, or of the winds, or of\r\nsaltpetre burnt by fire, as the thick and foul effluvia given out with very\r\ngreat force, from other bodies, or air set free from humour by heat rushing\r\nout through a pipe (in the instrument of Hero of Alexandria, described in\r\nhis {59} book _Spiritalia_), then the effluvium would drive everything\r\naway, not allure it. But those rarer effluvia take hold of bodies and\r\nembrace them as if with arms extended, with the electricks to which they\r\nare united; and they are drawn to the source, the effluvia increasing in\r\nstrength with the proximity. But what is that effluvium from crystal,\r\nglass, and diamond, since these are bodies of considerable hardness and\r\nfirmly concreted? In order that such an effluvium should be produced, there\r\nis no need of any marked or perceptible flux[142] of the substance; nor is\r\nit necessary that the electrick should be abraded, or worn away, or\r\ndeformed. Some odoriferous substances are fragrant for many years, exhaling\r\ncontinually, yet are not quickly consumed. Cypress wood as long as it is\r\nsound, and it lasts a very long time indeed, is redolent; as many learned\r\nmen attest from experience. Such an electrick only for a moment, when\r\nstimulated by friction, emits powers far more subtile and more fine beyond\r\nall odours; yet sometimes amber, jet, sulphur, when they are somewhat\r\neasily let free into vapour, also pour out at the same time an odour; and\r\non this account they allure with the very gentlest rubbing, often even\r\nwithout rubbing; they also excite more strongly, and retain hold for a\r\nlonger time, because they have stronger effluvia and last longer. But\r\ndiamond, glass, rock-crystal, * and numerous others of the harder and\r\nfirmly concreted gems first grow warm: therefore at first they are rubbed\r\nlonger, and then they also attract strongly; nor are they otherwise set\r\nfree into vapour. Everything rushes towards electricks[143] excepting\r\nflame, and flaming bodies, and the thinnest air. Just as they do not draw\r\nflame, in like manner they do not affect a versorium, if on any side it is\r\nvery near to a flame, either the flame of a lamp or of any burning matter.\r\nIt is manifest indeed that the effluvia are destroyed by flame and igneous\r\n* heat; and therefore they attract neither flame nor bodies very near a\r\nflame. For electrical effluvia have the virtue of, and are analogous with,\r\nextenuated humour; but they will produce their effect, union and\r\ncontinuity, not by the external impulse of vapours, not by heat and\r\nattenuation of heated bodies, but by their humidity itself attenuated into\r\nits own peculiar effluvia. Yet they entice * smoke sent out by an\r\nextinguished light; and the more that smoke is attenuated in seeking the\r\nupper regions, the less strongly is it turned aside; for things that are\r\ntoo rarefied are not drawn to them; and at length, when it has now almost\r\nvanished, it does not * incline towards them at all, which is easily seen\r\nagainst the light. When in fact the smoke has passed into air, it is not\r\nmoved, as has been demonstrated before. For air itself, if somewhat thin,\r\nis not attracted in any way, unless on account of succeeding that which has\r\nvacated its place, as in furnaces and such-like, where the air is fed in by\r\nmechanical devices for drawing it in. Therefore an effluvium resulting from\r\na non-fouling friction, and one which {60} is not changed by heat, but\r\nwhich is its own, causes union and coherency, a prehension and a congruence\r\ntowards its source, if only the body to be attracted is not unfitted for\r\nmotion, either by the surroundings of the bodies or by its own weight. To\r\nthe bodies therefore of the electricks themselves small bodies are borne.\r\nThe effluvia extend out their virtue--effluvia which are proper and\r\npeculiar to them, and _sui generis_, differing from common air, being\r\nproduced from humour, excited by a calorifick motion from attrition and\r\nattenuation. And as if they were material rays[144], they hold and take up\r\nchaff, straws, and twigs, until they become extinct or vanish away: and\r\nthen they (the corpuscles) being loosed again, attracted by the earth\r\nitself, fall down to the earth. The difference between Magneticks and\r\nElectricks[145] is that all magneticks run together with mutual forces;\r\nelectricks only allure; that which is allured is not changed by an\r\nimplanted force, but that which has moved up to *  them voluntarily rests\r\nupon them by the law of matter. Bodies are borne towards electricks in a\r\nstraight line towards the centre of the electrick; a loadstone draws a\r\nloadstone directly at the poles only, in other parts obliquely and\r\ntransversely, and in this way also they adhere and hang to one another.\r\nElectrical motion is a motion of aggregation of matter; magnetical motion\r\nis one of disposition and conformation. The globe of the earth is\r\naggregated and cohæres by itself electrically. The globe of the earth is\r\ndirected and turned magnetically; at the same time also it both cohæres,\r\nand in order that it may be solid, is in its inmost parts cemented\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOpinions of others on Magnetick Coition,\r\n_which they call Attraction_.\r\n\r\nDiscussion having now been made concerning electricks, the causes of\r\nmagnetick coition must be set forth. We say coition, not attraction[146].\r\nThe word attraction unfortunately crept into magnetick philosophy from the\r\nignorance of the ancients; for there seems to be force applied where there\r\nis attraction and an imperious violence dominates. For, if ever there is\r\ntalk about magnetick attraction, we understand thereby magnetick coition,\r\nor a primary running together. Now in truth it will not be useless here\r\nfirst briefly to set forth the views given by others, both the ancient {61}\r\nand the more modern writers. Orpheus in his hymns[147] narrates that iron\r\nis attracted by loadstone as the bride to the arms of her espoused.\r\nEpicurus holds that iron is attracted by a loadstone just as straws by\r\namber; \"and,\" he adds, \"the Atoms and indivisible particles which are given\r\noff by the stone and by the iron fit one another in shape; so that they\r\neasily cling to one another; when therefore these solid particles of stone\r\nor of iron strike against one another, then they rebound into space, being\r\nbrought against one another by the way, and they draw the iron along with\r\nthem.\" But this cannot be the case in the least; since solid and very dense\r\nsubstances interposed, even squared blocks of marble, do not obstruct this\r\npower, though they can separate atoms from atoms; and the stone and the\r\niron would be speedily dissipated into such profuse and perpetual streams\r\nof atoms. In the case of amber, since there is another different method of\r\nattracting, the Epicurean atoms cannot fit one another in shape. Thales, as\r\nAristotle writes, _De Anima_, Bk. I., deemed the loadstone to be endowed\r\nwith a soul of some sort, because it had the power of moving and drawing\r\niron towards it. Anaxagoras also held the same view. In the _Timæus_ of\r\nPlato there is an idle fancy[148] about the efficacy of the stone of\r\nHercules. For he says that \"all flowings of water, likewise the fallings of\r\nthunderbolts, and the things which are held wonderful in the attraction of\r\nAmber, and of the Herculean stone, are such that in all these there is\r\nnever any attraction; but since there is no vacuum, the particles drive one\r\nanother mutually around, and when they are dispersed and congregated\r\ntogether, they all pass, each to its proper seat, but with changed places;\r\nand it is forsooth, on account of these intercomplicated affections that\r\nthe effects seem to arouse the wonder in him who has rightly investigated\r\nthem.\" Galen does not know why Plato should have seen fit to select the\r\ntheory of circumpulsion rather than that of attraction (differing almost on\r\nthis point alone from Hippocrates), though indeed it does not agree in\r\nreality with either reason or experiment. Nor indeed is either the air or\r\nanything else circumpelled; and the bodies themselves which are attracted\r\nare carried towards the attracting substance not confusedly, or in an orbe.\r\nLucretius, the poet of the Epicurean sect, sang his opinion of it thus:\r\n\r\n                      [149]_First, then, know,_\r\n  _Ceaseless effluvia from the magnet flow,--_\r\n  _Effluvia, whose superior powers expel_\r\n  _The air that lies between the stone and steel._\r\n  _A vacuum formed, the steely atoms fly_\r\n  _In a link'd train, and all the void supply;_\r\n  _While the whole ring to which the train is join'd_\r\n  _The influence owns, and follows close behind. &c._\r\n\r\n{62} Such a reason Plutarch also alleges in the _Quæstiones Platonicæ_:\r\nThat that stone gives off heavy exhalations, whereby the adjacent air,\r\nbeing impelled along, condenses that which is in front of it; and that air,\r\nbeing driven round in an orbe and reverting to the place it had vacated,\r\ndrags the iron forcibly along with it. The following explanation of the\r\nvirtues of the loadstone and of amber is propounded by Johannes Costæus of\r\nLodi[150]. For he would have it that \"there is mutual work and mutual\r\nresult, and therefore the motion is partly due to the attraction of the\r\nloadstone and partly to a spontaneous movement on the part of the iron: For\r\nas we say that vapours issuing from the loadstone hasten by their own\r\nnature to attract the iron, so also the air repelled by the vapours, whilst\r\nseeking a place for itself, is turned back, and when turned back, it impels\r\nthe iron, lifts it up, as it were, and carries it along; the iron being of\r\nitself also excited somehow. So by being drawn out and by a spontaneous\r\nmotion, and by striking against another substance, there is in some way\r\nproduced a composite motion, which motion would nevertheless be rightly\r\nreferred to attraction, because the terminus from which this motion\r\ninvariably begins is the same terminus at which it ends, which is the\r\ncharacteristic proper of an attraction.\" There is certainly a mutual\r\naction, not an operation, nor does the loadstone attract in that way; nor\r\nis there any impulsion. But neither is there that origination of the motion\r\nby the vapours, and the turning of them back, which opinion of Epicurus has\r\nso often been quoted by others. Galen errs in his _De Naturalibus\r\nFacultatibus_, Book I., chap. 14, when he expresses the view that whatever\r\nagents draw out either the venom of serpents or darts also exhibit the same\r\npower as the loadstone. Now of what sort may be the attraction of such\r\nmedicaments (if indeed it may be called attraction) we shall consider\r\nelsewhere. Drugs against poisons or darts have no relation to, no\r\nsimilitude with, the action of magnetical bodies. The followers of Galen\r\n(who hold that purgative medicaments attract because of similitude of\r\nsubstance) say that bodies are attracted on account of similitude, not\r\nidentity, of substance; wherefore the loadstone draws iron, but iron does\r\nnot draw iron. But we declare and prove that this happens in primary\r\nbodies, and in those bodies that are pretty closely related to them and\r\nespecially like in kind one to another, on account of their identity;\r\nwherefore also loadstone draws loadstone and likewise iron iron; every\r\nreally true earth draws earth; and iron fortified by a loadstone within the\r\norbe of whose virtue it is placed draws iron more strongly than it does the\r\nloadstone. Cardan asks why no other metal is attracted by any other stone;\r\nbecause (he replies) no metal is so cold as iron; as if indeed cold were\r\nthe cause of the attraction, or as if iron were much colder than lead,\r\nwhich neither follows nor is deflected towards a loadstone. {63} But that\r\nis a chilly story, and worse than an old woman's tale. So also is the\r\nnotion that the loadstone is alive and that iron is its food. But how does\r\nthe loadstone feed on the iron, when the filings in which it is kept are\r\nneither consumed nor become lighter? Cornelius Gemma, _Cosmographia_, Bk.\r\nX.[151], holds that the loadstone draws iron to it by insensible rays, to\r\nwhich opinion he conjoins a story of a sucking fish and another about an\r\nantelope. Guilielmus Puteanus[152] derives it, \"not from any property of\r\nthe whole substance unknown to any one and which cannot be demonstrated in\r\nany way (as Galen, and after him almost all the physicians, have asserted),\r\nbut from the essential nature of the thing itself, as if moving from the\r\nfirst by itself, and, as it were, by its own most powerful nature and from\r\nthat innate temperament, as it were an instrument, which its substance, its\r\neffective nature uses in its operations, or a secondary cause and deprived\r\nof its intermediary\"; so the loadstone attracts the iron not without a\r\nphysical cause and for the sake of some good. But there is no such thing in\r\nother substances springing from some material form; unless it were primary,\r\nwhich he does not recognize. But certes good is shown to the loadstone by\r\nthe stroke of the iron (as it were, association with a friend); yet it\r\ncannot either be discovered or conceived how that disposition may be the\r\ninstrument of form. For what can temperament do in magnetical motions,\r\nwhich must be compared with the fixed, definite, constant motions of the\r\nstars, at great distances in case of the interposition of very dense and\r\nthick bodies? To Baptista Porta[153] the loadstone seems a sort of mixture\r\nof stone and iron, in such a way that it is an iron stone or stony iron.\r\n\"But I think\" (he says) \"the Loadstone is a mixture of stone and iron, as\r\nan iron stone, or a stone of iron. Yet do not think the stone is so changed\r\ninto iron, as to lose its own Nature, nor that the iron is so drowned in\r\nthe stone, but it preserves itself; and whilst one labours to get the\r\nvictory of the other, the attraction is made by the combat between them. In\r\nthat body there is more of the stone than of iron; and therefore the iron,\r\nthat it may not be subdued by the stone, desires the force and company of\r\niron; that being not able to resist alone, it may be able by more help to\r\ndefend itself.... The Loadstone draws not stones, because it wants them\r\nnot, for there is stone enough in the body of it; and if one Loadstone draw\r\nanother, it is not for the stone, but for the iron that is in it.\" As if in\r\nthe loadstone the iron were a distinct body and not mixed up as the other\r\nmetals in their ores! And that these, being so mixed up, should fight with\r\none another, and should extend their quarrel, and that in consequence of\r\nthe battle auxiliary forces should be called in, is indeed absurd. But iron\r\nitself, when excited by a loadstone, seizes iron no less strongly than the\r\nloadstone. Therefore those fights, seditions, and conspiracies in the\r\nstone, as if it were nursing up perpetual quarrels, {64} whence it might\r\nseek auxiliary forces, are the ravings of a babbling old woman, not the\r\ninventions of a distinguished mage. Others have lit upon sympathy as the\r\ncause. There may be fellow-feeling, and yet the cause is not\r\nfellow-feeling; for no passion can rightly be said to be an efficient\r\ncause. Others hold likeness of substance, many others insensible rays as\r\nthe cause; men who also in very many cases often wretchedly misuse rays,\r\nwhich were first introduced in the natural sciences by the mathematicians.\r\nMore eruditely does Scaliger[154] say that the iron moves toward the\r\nloadstone as if toward its parent, by whose secret principles it may be\r\nperfected, just as the earth toward its centre. The Divine Thomas[155] does\r\nnot differ much from him, when in the 7th book of his _Physica_ he\r\ndiscusses the reasons of motions. \"In another way,\" he says, \"it may be\r\nsaid to attract a thing, because it moves it to itself by altering it in\r\nsome way, from which alteration it happens that when altered it moves\r\naccording to its position, and in this manner the loadstone is said to\r\nattract iron. For as the parent moves things whether heavy or light, in as\r\nfar as it gives them a form, by means of which they are moved to their\r\nplace; so also the loadstone gives a certain quality to the iron, in\r\naccordance with which it moves towards it.\" This by no means ill-conceived\r\nopinion this most learned man shortly afterwards endeavoured to confirm by\r\nthings which had obtained little credence respecting the loadstone and the\r\nadverse forces of garlick. Cardinal Cusan[156] also is not to be despised.\r\n\"Iron has,\" he says, \"in the loadstone a certain principle of its own\r\neffluence; and whilst the loadstone by its own presence excites the heavy\r\nand ponderous iron, the iron is borne by a wonderful yearning, even above\r\nthe motion of nature (by which in accordance with its weight it ought to\r\ntend downwards) and moves upwards, in uniting itself with its own\r\nprinciple. For if there were not in the iron a certain natural foretaste of\r\nthe loadstone itself, it would not move to the loadstone any more than to\r\nany other stone; and unless there were in the stone a greater inclination\r\nfor iron than for copper, there would not be that attraction.\" Such are the\r\nopinions expressed about the loadstone attracting (or the general sense of\r\neach), all dubious and untrustworthy. But those causes of the magnetical\r\nmotions, which in the schools of the Philosophers are referred to the four\r\nelements and the prime qualities, we relinquish to the moths and the worms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{65} CHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\nOn Magnetick Force & Form, what it is; and on the\r\n_cause of the Coition_.\r\n\r\nRelinquishing the opinions of others on the attraction of loadstone, we\r\nshall now show the reason of that coition and the translatory nature of\r\nthat motion. Since there are really two kinds of bodies, which seem to\r\nallure bodies with motions manifest to our senses, Electricks and\r\nMagneticks, the Electricks produce the tendency by natural effluvia from\r\nhumour; the Magneticks by agencies due to form, or rather by the prime\r\nforces. This form is unique, and particular, not the formal cause of the\r\nPeripateticks, or the specifick in mixtures, or the secondary form; not the\r\npropagator of generating bodies, but the form of the primary and chief\r\nspheres and of those parts of them which are homogeneous and not corrupted,\r\na special entity and existence, which we may call a primary and radical and\r\nastral form; not the primary form of Aristotle, but that unique form, which\r\npreserves and disposes its own proper sphere. There is one such in each\r\nseveral globe, in the Sun, the moon, and the stars; one also in the earth,\r\nwhich is that true magnetick potency which we call the primary vigour.\r\nWherefore there is a magnetick nature peculiar to the earth and implanted\r\nin all its truer parts in a primary and astonishing manner; this is neither\r\nderived nor produced from the whole heaven by sympathy or influence or more\r\noccult qualities, nor from any particular star; for there is in the earth a\r\nmagnetick vigour of its own, just as in the sun and moon there are forms of\r\ntheir own, and a small portion of the moon settles itself in moon-manner\r\ntoward its termini and form; and a piece of the sun to the sun, just as a\r\nloadstone to the earth and to a second loadstone by inclining itself and\r\nalluring in accordance with its nature. We must consider therefore about\r\nthe earth what magnetical bodies are, and what is a magnet; then also about\r\nthe truer parts of it, which are magnetical, and how they are affected as a\r\nresult of the coition. A body which is attracted by an electrick is not\r\nchanged by it, but remains unshaken and unchanged, as it was before, nor\r\ndoes it excel any the more in virtue. A loadstone draws magnetical\r\nsubstances, which eagerly acquire power from its strength, not in their\r\nextremities only, but in their inward parts and * their very marrow. For\r\nwhen a rod of iron is laid hold of, it is magnetically excited in the end\r\nby which it is laid hold of, and that {66} force penetrates even to the\r\nother extremity, not through its surface only, but through the interior and\r\nall through the middle. Electrical bodies have material and corporeal\r\neffluvia. Is any such magnetical effluvium given off, whether corporeal or\r\nincorporeal? or is nothing at all given off that subsists? If it really has\r\na body, that body must be thin and spiritual, since it is necessary that it\r\nshould be able to enter into iron. Or what sort of an exhalation is it that\r\ncomes from lead, when quicksilver which is bright and fluid is bound\r\ntogether by the odour merely and vapour of the lead, and remains, as it\r\nwere, a firm metal? But even gold, which is exceedingly solid and dense, is\r\nreduced to a powder by the thin vapour of lead. Or, seeing that, as the\r\nquicksilver has entrance into gold, so the magnetical odour has entrance\r\ninto the substance of the iron, how does it change it in its essential\r\nproperty, although no change is perceptible to our senses in the bodies\r\nthemselves? For without ingression into the body, the body is not changed,\r\nas the Chemists not incorrectly teach. But if indeed these things resulted\r\nfrom a material ingression, then if strong and dense and thick substances\r\nhad been interposed between the bodies, or if magnetical substances had\r\nbeen inclosed in the centres of the most solid and the densest bodies, the\r\niron particles would not have suffered anything from the loadstone. But\r\nnone the less they strive to come together and are changed. Therefore there\r\nis no such conception and origin of the magnetick powers; nor do the very\r\nminute portions of the stone exist, which have been wrongly imagined to\r\nexist by Baptista Porta, aggregated, as it were, into hairs, and arising\r\nfrom the rubbing of the stone which, sticking to the iron, constitute its\r\nstrength. Electrick effluvia are not only impeded by any dense matter, but\r\nalso in like manner by flames, or if a small flame is near, they do not\r\nallure. But as iron is not hindered by any obstacle from receiving force or\r\nmotion from a loadstone, so it will pass through the midst of flames to the\r\nbody of the loadstone and adhære to the stone. Let there be a flame or a\r\ncandle near the stone; bring up a short piece of iron wire, and when it has\r\ncome near, it will penetrate through the midst of the flames to the stone;\r\n* and a versorium turns towards the loadstone nor more slowly nor less\r\neagerly through the midst of flames than through open air. So flames\r\ninterposed do not hinder the coition. But if the iron itself became heated\r\nby a great heat, it is demonstrable that it would not be attracted. Bring a\r\nstrongly ignited rod of iron near a magnetized versorium; the versorium\r\nremains steady and does not turn towards * such iron; but it immediately\r\nturns towards it, so soon as it has lost somewhat of its heat. When a piece\r\nof iron has been touched by a loadstone, if it be placed in a hot fire\r\nuntil it is perfectly red hot * and remain in the fire some considerable\r\ntime, it will lose that magnetick strength it had acquired. Even a\r\nloadstone itself through a {67} longish stay in the fire, loses the powers\r\nof attracting implanted and innate in it, and any other magnetick powers.\r\nAnd although certain veins of loadstone exhale when burnt a dark vapour of\r\na black colour, or of a sulphurous foul odour, yet that vapour was not the\r\nsoul, or the cause of its attraction of iron (as Porta thinks), nor do all\r\nloadstones whilst they are being baked or burnt smell of or exhale sulphur.\r\nIt is acquired as a sort of inborn defect from a rather impure mine or\r\nmatrix. Nor does anything analogous penetrate into the iron from that\r\nmaterial corporeal cause, since the iron conceives the power of attracting\r\nand verticity from the loadstone, even if glass or gold or any other stone\r\nbe interposed. Then also cast iron acquires the power of attracting iron,\r\nand verticity, from the verticity of the earth, as we shall afterwards\r\nplainly demonstrate in _Direction_. But fire destroys the magnetick virtues\r\nin a stone, not because it takes away any parts specially attractive, but\r\nbecause the consuming force of the flame mars by the demolition of the\r\nmaterial the form of the whole; as in the human body the primary faculties\r\nof the soul are not burnt, but the charred body remains without faculties.\r\nThe iron indeed may remain after the burning is completed and is not\r\nchanged into ash or slag; nevertheless (as Cardan not inaptly says) burnt\r\niron is not iron, but something placed outside its nature until it is\r\nreduced. For just as by the rigour of the surrounding air[157] water is\r\nchanged from its nature into ice; so iron, glowing in fire, is destroyed by\r\nthe violent heat, and has its nature confused and perturbed; wherefore also\r\nit is not attracted by a loadstone, and even loses that power of attracting\r\nin whatever way acquired, and acquires another verticity when, being, as it\r\nwere, born again, it is impregnated by a loadstone or the earth, or when\r\nits form is revived, not having been dead but confused, concerning which\r\nmany things are manifest in the change of verticity. Wherefore\r\nFracastorio[158] does not confirm his opinion, that the iron is not\r\naltered; \"for if it were altered,\" he says, \"by the form of the loadstone,\r\nthe form of the iron would have been spoiled.\" This alteration is not\r\ngeneration, but the restitution and reformation of a confused form. There\r\nis not therefore anything corporeal which comes from the loadstone or which\r\nenters the iron, or which is sent back from the iron when it is stimulated;\r\nbut loadstone disposes loadstone by its primary form; iron, however, which\r\nis closely related to it, loadstone at the same time recalls to its\r\nconformate strength, and settles it; on account of which it rushes to the\r\nloadstone and eagerly conforms itself to it (the forces of each in harmony\r\nbringing them together). The coition also is not vague or confused, not a\r\nviolent inclination of body to body, no rash and mad congruency; no\r\nviolence is here applied to the bodies; there are no strifes or discords;\r\nbut there is that concord (without which the universe would go to pieces),\r\nthat analogy, namely, of the {68} perfect and homogeneous parts of the\r\nspheres of the universe to the whole, and a mutual concurrency of the\r\nprincipal forces in them, tending to soundness, continuity, position,\r\ndirection, and to unity. Wherefore in the case of such wonderful action and\r\nsuch a stupendous implanted vigour (diverse from other natures) the opinion\r\nof Thales of Miletus[159] was not very absurd, nor was it downright\r\nmadness, in the judgment of Scaliger, for him to grant the loadstone a\r\nsoul; for the loadstone is incited, directed, and orbitally moved by this\r\nforce, which is all in all, and, as will be made clear afterwards, all in\r\nevery part; and it seems to be very like a soul. For the power of moving\r\nitself seems to point to a soul; and the supernal bodies, which are also\r\ncelestial, divine, as it were, are thought by some to be animated, because\r\nthey move with admirable order. If two loadstones be set one over against\r\nthe other, each in a boat, on the surface of water, they do not immediately\r\nrun together, but first they turn towards one another, or the lesser\r\nconforms to the greater, by moving itself in a somewhat circular manner,\r\nand at length, when they are disposed according to their nature, they run\r\ntogether. In smelted iron which has not been excited by a magnet there is\r\nno need for such an apparatus; since it has no verticity, excepting what is\r\nadventitious and acquired, and that not stable and confirmed (as is the\r\ncase with loadstone, even if the iron has been smelted from the best\r\nloadstone), on account of the confusion of the parts by fire when it flowed\r\nas a liquid; it suddenly acquires polarity and natural aptitude by the\r\npresence of the loadstone, by a powerful mutation, and by a conversion into\r\na perfect magnet, and by an absolute metamorphosis; and it flies to the\r\nbody of the magnet as if it were a real piece of loadstone. For a loadstone\r\nhas no power, nor can a perfect loadstone do anything which iron when\r\nexcited by loadstone cannot perform, even when it has not been touched but\r\nonly placed in its vicinity. For when first it is within the orbe of virtue\r\nof the loadstone, though it may be some distance away, yet it is\r\nimmediately changed, and has a renovated form, formerly indeed dormant and\r\ninert in body, now lively and strong, which will be clearly apparent in the\r\ndemonstrations of _Direction_. So the magnetick coition is a motion of the\r\nloadstone and of the iron, not an action of one[160]; an [Greek:\r\nentelecheia], of each, not [Greek: ergon]; a [Greek: sunentelecheia] or\r\nconjoint action, rather than a sympathy. There is properly no such thing as\r\nmagnetick antipathy. For the flight and declination of the ends, or an\r\nentire turning about, is an action of each towards unity by the conjoint\r\naction and [Greek: sunentelecheia] of both. It has therefore newly put on\r\nthe form, and on account of this being roused, it then, in order that it\r\nmay more surely acquire it, rushes headlong on the loadstone, not with\r\ncurves and turnings, as a loadstone to a loadstone. For since in a\r\nloadstone both verticity and the power disponent have existed through many\r\nages, or from the very beginnings, {69} have been inborn and confirmed, and\r\nalso the special form of the terrestrial globe cannot easily be changed by\r\nanother loadstone, as iron is changed; it happens from the constant nature\r\nof each, that one has not the sudden power over another of changing its\r\nverticity, but that they can only mutually come to agreement with each\r\nother. Again, iron which has been excited by a loadstone, * if that iron on\r\naccount of obstacles should not be able to turn round immediately in\r\naccordance with its nature, as happens with a versorium, is laid hold of,\r\nwhen a loadstone approaches, on either side or at either end. Because, just\r\nas it can implant, so it can suddenly change the polarity and turn about\r\nthe formal energies to any part whatever. So variously can iron be\r\ntransformed when its form is adventitious and has not yet been long\r\nresident in the metal. In the case of iron, on account of the fusion of the\r\nsubstance when magnetick ore or iron is smelted, the virtue of its primary\r\nform, distinct before, is now confused; but an entire loadstone placed near\r\nit again sets up its primal activity; its adjusted and arranged form joins\r\nits allied strength with the loadstone; and both mutually agree and are\r\nleagued together magnetically in all their motions towards unity, and\r\nwhether joined by bodily contact or adjusted within the orbe, they are one\r\nand the same. For when iron is smelted out of its own ore, or steel (the\r\nmore noble kind of iron) out of its ore, that is, out of loadstone, the\r\nmaterial is loosed by the force of the fire, and flows away, and iron as\r\nwell as steel flow out from their dross and are separated from it; and the\r\ndross is either spoiled by the force of the fire and rendered useless, or\r\nis a kind of dregs of a certain imperfection and of mixture in the\r\nprominent parts of the earth. The material therefore is a purified one, in\r\nwhich the metallick parts, which are now mixed up by the melting, since\r\nthose special forces of its form are confused and uncertain, by the\r\napproach of a loadstone are called back to life, as if to a kind of\r\ndisponent form and integrity. The material is thus awakened and moves\r\ntogether into unity, the bond of the universe and the essential for its\r\nconservation. On this account and by the purging of the material into a\r\ncleaner body, the loadstone gives to the iron a greater force of attracting\r\nthan there is in itself. For if iron dust * or an iron nail be placed over\r\na large loadstone, a piece of iron joined to it takes away the filings and\r\nnail from the loadstone and retains them so long as it is near the\r\nloadstone; wherefore iron attracts iron more than loadstone does, if it\r\nhave been conformed by a loadstone and remains within the orbe of its\r\ncommunicated form. A piece of iron even, skilfully placed near the pole of\r\na loadstone, lifts up more than the loadstone. Therefore the material of\r\nits own ore is better, and by the force of fire steel and iron are\r\nre-purged; and they are again impregnated by the loadstone with its own\r\nforms; therefore they move towards it by a spontaneous {70} approach as\r\nsoon as they have entered within the orbe of the magnetick forces, because\r\nthey were possessed by it before, connected and united with it in a perfect\r\nunion; & they have immediately an absolute continuity within that orbe, &\r\nhave been joined on account of their harmony, though their bodies may have\r\nbeen disjoined. For the iron is not taken possession of and allured by\r\nmaterial effluvia, after the manner of electricks, but only by the\r\nimmaterial action of its form or an incorporeal progression, which in a\r\npiece of iron as its subject acts and is conceived, as it were, in a\r\ncontinuous homogeneous body, and does not need more open ways. Therefore\r\n(though the most solid substances be interposed) the iron is still moved\r\nand attracted, and by the presence of loadstone the iron moves and attracts\r\nthe loadstone itself, and by mutual forces a concurrency is made towards\r\nunity, which is commonly called attraction of the iron. But those formal\r\nforces pass out and are united to one another by meeting together; a force\r\nalso, when conceived in the iron, begins to flow out without delay. But\r\nJulius Scaliger, who by other examples contends that this theory is absurd,\r\nmakes in his 344th Exercise a great mistake. For the virtues of primary\r\nbodies are not to be compared with bodies formed from and mixed with them.\r\nHe would now have been able (had he been still alive) to discern the nature\r\nof effused forms in the chapter on forms effused by spherical magneticks.\r\nBut if iron is injured somewhat by rust, it is affected either only\r\nslightly or not at all by the stone. For the metal is spoiled when eaten\r\naway and deformed by external injuries or by lapse of time (just as has\r\nbeen said about the loadstone), and it loses its prime qualities which are\r\nconjoined to its form; or, being worn out by age, retains them in a languid\r\nand weak condition; indeed it cannot be properly re-formed, when it has\r\nbeen corrupted. But a powerful and fresh loadstone attracts sound and clean\r\npieces of iron, and those pieces of iron (when they have conceived\r\nstrength) have a powerful attraction for other iron wires and iron nails,\r\nnot only one at a time, but even successively one behind another, three,\r\nfour or five, end to end, sticking and hanging in order like a chain. The\r\nloadstone, however, would not attract the last one following in such a row,\r\nif there were no nails between. [Illustration] A loadstone placed as at A\r\ndraws a nail or a bar B; similarly behind B it draws C; and after C, D. But\r\nthe nails B and C being removed, the loadstone A, if it remain at the same\r\ndistance, does not raise the nail D into the air. This occurs for this\r\nreason: because in the case of a continuous row of nails the presence of\r\nthe loadstone A, besides its own powers, raises the magnetick natures of\r\nthe iron works B and C, and makes them, as it were, forces auxiliary to\r\nitself. But B and C, like a continuous magnetical body, extend as far as\r\n{71} D the forces by which D is taken and conformed, though they are weaker\r\nthan those which C receives from B. And those iron nails indeed from that\r\ncontact only, and from the presence of the loadstone even without contact,\r\nacquire powers which they retain in their own bodies, as will be\r\ndemonstrated most clearly in the passage _on Direction_. For not only\r\nwhilst the stone is present does the iron assume these powers, and take\r\nthem, as it were, vicariously from the stone, as Themistius lays down in\r\nhis 8th book on Physicks[161]. The best iron, when it has been melted down\r\n(such is steel), is allured by a loadstone from a greater distance, is\r\nraised though of greater weight, is held more firmly, assumes stronger\r\npowers than the common and less expensive, because it is cast from a better\r\nore or loadstone, imbued with better powers. But what is made from more\r\nimpure ore turns out weaker and is moved more feebly. As to\r\nFracastorio's[162] statement that he saw a piece of loadstone draw a\r\nloadstone by one of its faces, but not iron; by another face iron, but not\r\nloadstone; by another both; which he says is an indication that in one part\r\nthere is more of the loadstone, in another more of the iron, in another\r\nboth equally, whence arises that diversity of attraction; it is most\r\nincorrect and badly observed on the part of Fracastorio, who did not know\r\nhow to apply skilfully loadstone to loadstone. A loadstone draws iron and\r\nalso a loadstone, if both are suitably arranged and free and unrestrained.\r\nThat is removed more quickly from its position and place which is lighter;\r\nfor the heavier bodies are in weight, the more they resist; but the lighter\r\nboth moves itself to meet the heavier and is allured by the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nHow the Power dwells in the\r\n_Loadstone_.\r\n\r\nThat a loadstone attracts loadstone, iron and other magnetical bodies, has\r\nbeen shown above in the previous book, and also with what strength the\r\nmagnetick coition is ordered; but now we must inquire how that vigour is\r\ndisposed in a magnetick substance. And indeed an analogy must be inferred\r\nfrom a large loadstone. Any magnetick substance joins itself with a\r\nloadstone strongly, if the loadstone itself is strong; but more weakly,\r\nwhen it is somewhat imperfect or has been weakened by some flaw. A\r\nloadstone does not draw iron equally well with every part; or a magnetick\r\nsubstance does not approach every part of a loadstone alike; because a\r\nloadstone has its points, that is its true poles, in which an exceptional\r\nvirtue excels. Parts nearer the pole are {72} stronger, those far away more\r\nweak, and yet in all the power is in a certain way equal. The poles of a\r\nterrella are A, B; the æquinoctial is C, D. At A and B the alluring force\r\nseems greatest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt C and D there is no force alluring magnetick ends to the body, for the\r\nforces tend toward both poles. But direction is powerful on the æquator. At\r\nC, D, the distances are equal from both poles; therefore iron which is at\r\nC, D, when it is allured in contrary ways, does not adhære with constancy;\r\nbut it remains and is joined to the stone, if only it incline to the one or\r\nother side. At E there is a greater power of alluring than at F, because E\r\nis nearer the pole. This is not so because there is really greater virtue\r\nresiding at the pole, but since all the parts are united in the whole, they\r\ndirect their forces towards the pole. From the forces flowing from the\r\nplane of the æquinoctial towards the pole, the power increases. A fixed\r\nverticity exists at the pole, so long as the loadstone remains whole; if it\r\nis divided or broken, the verticity obtains other * positions in the parts\r\ninto which it is divided. For the verticity always changes in consequence\r\nof any change in the mass, and for this cause, if the terrella be divided\r\nfrom A to B, so that there are two stones, the poles will not be A, B, in\r\nthe divided parts, but F, G, and H, I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] {73}\r\n\r\nAlthough these stones now are in agreement with one another, so that F\r\nwould not seek H, yet if A was previously the boreal pole[163], F is now\r\nboreal, and H also boreal; for the verticity is not changed (as Baptista\r\nPorta incorrectly affirms in the fourth chapter of his seventh book);\r\nsince, though F and H do not agree, so that the one would incline to the\r\nother, yet both turn to the same point of the horizon. If the hemisphere H\r\nI be divided into two quadrants, the one pole takes up its position in H,\r\nthe other in I. The whole mass of the stone, as I have said, retains the\r\nsite of its vertex constant; and any part of the stone, before it was cut\r\nout from the block[164], might have been the pole or vertex. But concerning\r\nthis more under _Direction_. It is important now to comprehend and to keep\r\nfirmly in mind that the vertices are strong on account of the force of the\r\nwhole, so that (the command being, as it were, divided by the æquinoctial)\r\nall the forces on one side tend towards the north; but those of an opposite\r\nway towards the south, so long as the parts are united, as in the following\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor so, by an infinite number of curves from every point of the equator\r\ndividing the sphere into two equal parts, and from every point of the\r\nsurface from the æquator towards the North, and from the æquator towards\r\nthe Southern pole, the whole force tends asunder toward the poles. So the\r\nverticity is from the æquinoctial {74} circle towards the pole in each\r\ndirection. Such is the power reposed in the undivided stone. From A vigour\r\nis sent to B, from A, B, to C, from A, B, C, to D, and from them likewise\r\nto E. In like manner from G to H, and so forth, as long as the whole is\r\nunited. But if a piece A B be cut out (although it is near the æquator),\r\nyet it will be as strong in its magnetical actions as C D or D E, if torn\r\naway from the whole in equal quantity. For no part excels in special worth\r\nin the whole mass except by what is owing to the other adjoining parts by\r\nwhich an absolute and perfect whole is attained.\r\n\r\n_Diagram of Magnetic Vigour\r\ntransmitted from the plane of the Æquator\r\nto the peripherery of the terella\r\nor of the earth_\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{75} HEQ is a terrella, E a pole, M the centre, HMQ the æquinoctial plane.\r\nFrom every point of the æquinoctial plane vigour extends to the periphery,\r\nbut by various methods; for from A the formal force is transmitted towards\r\nC, F, N, E, and to every point from C up to E, the pole; but not towards B;\r\nso neither from G towards C. The power of alluring is not strengthened in\r\nthe part FHG from that which is in GMFE, but FGH increases the force in the\r\neminence FE. So no force rises from the internal parts, from the lines\r\nparallel to the Axis above those parallels, but always inwards from the\r\nparallels to the pole. From every point of the plane of the equator force\r\nproceeds to the pole E, but the point F has its powers only from GH, and N\r\nfrom OH; but the pole E is strengthened from the whole plane HQ. Wherefore\r\nin it the mighty power excels (just as in a palace); but in the\r\nintermediate intervals (as in F) only so much force of alluring is exerted\r\nas the portion HG of the plane can contribute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nHow magnetick pieces of Iron and smaller\r\n_loadstones conform themselves to a terrella & to_\r\nthe earth itself, and by them are\r\n_disposed_.\r\n\r\nCoition of those bodies which are divided, and do not naturally cohære, if\r\nthey are free, occurs through another kind of motion. A terrella sends out\r\nin an orbe its powers in proportion to its vigour and quality. But when\r\niron or any other magnetick of convenient magnitude comes within its orbe\r\nof virtue, it is allured; but the nearer it comes to the body, the more\r\nquickly it runs up to it. They move towards the magnet, not as * to a\r\ncentre, nor towards its centre. For they only do this in the case of the\r\npoles themselves, when namely that which is being allured, and the pole of\r\nthe loadstone, and its centre, are in the same straight line. But in the\r\nintervening spaces they tend obliquely, just as is evident in the following\r\nfigure, in which it is shown how the influence is extended to the adjoining\r\nmagneticks within the orbe; in the case of the poles straight out.\r\n\r\n{76} [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe nearer the parts are to the æquinoctial, the more obliquely are\r\nmagneticals allured; but the parts nearer the poles appeal more directly,\r\nat the poles quite straight. The principle of the turning of all\r\nloadstones, of those which are round and those which are long, is the same,\r\nbut in the case of the long ones the experiment is easier. For in whatever\r\nform they are the verticity exists, and there are poles; but on account of\r\nbad and unequal form, they are often hindered by certain evils. If the\r\nstone were long, the vertex is at the ends, not on the sides; it allures\r\nmore strongly at the vertex. For the parts bring together stronger forces\r\nto the pole in right lines than oblique. So the stone and the earth conform\r\ntheir magnetick motions by their nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOn the Potency of the Magnetick Virtue, and on\r\nits nature capable of spreading out into an orbe.\r\n\r\nFrom about a magnetical body the virtue magnetical is poured out on every\r\nside around in an orbe; around a terrella; in the case of other shapes of\r\nstones, more confusedly and unevenly. But yet there exists in nature no\r\norbe or permanent or essential virtue spread through the air, but a magnet\r\n{77} only excites magneticks at a convenient distance from it. And as light\r\ncomes in an instant (as the opticians teach), so much more[165] quickly is\r\nthe magnetick vigour present within the limits of its strength; and because\r\nits activity is much more subtile than light, and does not consent with a\r\nnon-magnetick substance, it has no intercourse with air, water, or any\r\nnon-magnetick; nor does it move a magnetick with any motion by forces\r\nrushing upon it, but being present in an instant, it invites friendly\r\nbodies. And as light strikes an object, so a loadstone strikes a magnetick\r\nbody and excites it. And just as light does not remain in the air above\r\nvapours and effluvia, and is not reflected from those spaces, so neither is\r\nthe magnetick ray held in air or water. The appearances of things are\r\napprehended in an instant in mirrors and in the eye by means of light; so\r\nthe magnetick virtue seizes upon magneticks. Without the more intangible\r\nand shining bodies, the appearances of things are not seized or reflected;\r\nso without magnetical objects the magnetick power is not perceived, nor are\r\nthe forces thus conceived sent back again to the magnetick substance. In\r\nthis, however, the magnetick power excels light, in that it is not hindered\r\nby any opaque or solid substance, but proceeds freely, and extends its\r\nforces on every side. In a terrella and globe-shaped loadstone the\r\nmagnetick power is extended outside the body in an orbe; in a longer one,\r\nhowever, not in an orbe, but it is extended in an ambit conformably to the\r\nshape of the stone. As in the somewhat long stone A, the vigour is extended\r\nto the ambient limit F C D, equidistant on every side from the stone A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{78} CHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOn the geography of the Earth,\r\n_and of the Terrella_.\r\n\r\nDesiring that what follows may be better understood, we must now say\r\nsomething also about magnetick circles and limits. Astronomers, in order to\r\nunderstand and observe methodically the motion of the planets and the\r\nrevolution of the heavens, and to describe with more accuracy the celestial\r\nattire of the fixed stars, settled upon certain circles and definite limits\r\nin the sky (which geographers also imitate), so that the varied face of the\r\nearth and the beauty of its districts might be delineated. But we, in a way\r\ndiffering from them, recognize those limits and circles, and have found\r\nvery many fixed by nature, not merely conceived by the imagination, both in\r\nthe earth and in our terrella. The earth they mark out[166] chiefly by\r\nmeans of the æquator and the poles; and those limits indeed have been\r\narranged and marked out by nature. The meridians also indicate straight\r\npaths from pole to pole through distinct points on the æquator; by which\r\nway the magnetick virtue directs its course and moves. But the tropics and\r\narctic circles, as also the parallels, are not natural limits placed on the\r\nearth; but all parallel circles indicate a certain agreement of the lands\r\nsituated in the same latitude, or diametrically opposite. All these the\r\nMathematicians use for convenience, painting them on globes and maps. In\r\nlike manner also in a terrella all these are required; not, however, in\r\norder that its exterior appearance may be geographically delineated, since\r\nthe loadstone may be perfect, even, and uniform on all sides. And there are\r\nno upper and lower parts in the earth, nor are there in a terrella; unless\r\nperchance some one considers those parts superior which are in the\r\nperiphery, and those inferior which are situated more towards the centre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{79} CHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nOn the Æquinoctial Circle of the Earth\r\n_and of a Terrella_.\r\n\r\nAs conceived by astronomers the æquinoctial circle is equidistant from both\r\npoles, cutting the world in the middle, measures the motions of their\r\n_primum mobile_ or tenth sphere, and is named the zone of the _primum\r\nmobile_. It is called æquinoctial, because when the sun stands in it (which\r\nmust happen twice in the year) the days are equal to the nights. That\r\ncircle is also spoken of as _æquidialis_, wherefore it is called by the\r\nGreeks [Greek: isêmerinos]. In like manner it is also properly called\r\nÆquator, because it divides the whole frame of the earth between the poles\r\ninto equal parts. So also an æquator may be rightly assigned to a terrella,\r\nby which its power is naturally divided, and by the plane of which\r\npermeating through its centre, the whole globe is divided into equal parts\r\nboth in quantity and strength (as if by a transverse septum) between\r\nverticities on both sides imbued with equal vigour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nMagnetick Meridians of the Earth.\r\n\r\nMeridians have been thought out by the geographer, by means of which he\r\nmight both distinguish the longitude and measure the latitude of each\r\nregion. But the magnetick meridians are infinite, running in the same\r\ndirection also, through fixed and opposite limits on the æquator, and\r\nthrough the poles themselves. On them also the magnetick latitude is\r\nmeasured, and declinations are reckoned from them; and the fixed direction\r\nin them tends to the poles, unless it varies from some defect and the\r\nmagnetick is disturbed from the right way. What is commonly called a\r\nmagnetick meridian is not really magnetick, nor is it really a meridian,\r\nbut it is understood to pass through the termini of the variation on the\r\nhorizon. The variation is a depraved deviation from a meridian, nor is it\r\nfixed and constant in various places on any meridian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{80} CHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nParallels.\r\n\r\nIn parallel circles the same strength and equal power are perceived\r\neverywhere, when various magneticks are placed on one and the same parallel\r\neither on the earth or on a terrella. For they are distant from the poles\r\nby equal intervals and have equal tendencies of declination, and they are\r\nattracted and held, and they come together with like forces; just as those\r\nregions which are situated under the same parallel, even if they differ in\r\nlongitude, yet we say possess the same quantity of daylight and a climate\r\nequally tempered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nThe Magnetick Horizon.\r\n\r\nHorizon is the name given to the great circle, separating the things which\r\nare seen from those which are not seen; so that a half part of the heaven\r\nalways is open and easily seen by us, half is always hidden. This seems so\r\nto us on account of the great distance of the star-bearing orbe: yet the\r\ndifference is as great as may arise from the ratio of the semi-diameter of\r\nthe earth compared with the semi-diameter of the starry heaven, which\r\ndifference is in fact not perceived by our senses. We maintain, however,\r\nthat the magnetick horizon is a plane level throughout touching the earth\r\nor a terrella in the place of some one region, with which plane the\r\nsemi-diameter, whether of the earth or of the terrella, produced to the\r\nplace of the region, makes right angles on every side. Such a plane is to\r\nbe considered in the earth itself and also in the terrella, for magnetick\r\nproofs and demonstrations.

XIII.\r\n\r\nOn the Axis and Magnetick Poles.\r\n\r\nLet the line be called the axis which is drawn in the earth (as in a\r\nterrella) through the centre to the poles. They are called [Greek: poloi]\r\nby the Greeks from [Greek: polein], to turn, and by the Latins they are\r\nalso called _Cardines_ or _Vertices_; because the world rotates and is\r\nperpetually carried around them. We are about to show, indeed, that the\r\nearth and a terrella are turned about them by a magnetick influence. One of\r\nthem in the earth, which looks towards the Cynosure, is called Boreal and\r\nArctic; the other one, opposite to this, is called Austral and Antarctic.\r\nNor do these also exist on the earth or on a terrella for the sake of the\r\nturning merely; but they are also limits of direction and position, both as\r\nrespects destined districts of the world, and also for correct turnings\r\namong themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIIII.\r\n\r\nWhy at the Pole itself the Coition is stronger than in\r\n_the other parts intermediate between the æquator and the pole;_\r\nand on the proportion of forces of the coition in\r\n_various parts of the earth and of the terrella_.\r\n\r\nObservation has already been made that the highest power of alluring exists\r\nin the pole, and that it is weaker and more languid in the parts adjacent\r\nto the æquator. And as this is apparent in the declination, because that\r\ndisponent and rotational virtue has an augmentation as one proceeds from\r\nthe Æquator towards the poles: so also the coition of magneticks grows\r\nincreasingly fresh by the same steps, and in the same proportion. For in\r\nthe parts more remote from the poles the loadstone does not draw magneticks\r\nstraight down towards its own viscera; but they tend obliquely and they\r\nallure obliquely. For as the smallest chords in a circle differ from the\r\ndiameter, so much do the forces of attracting differ between themselves in\r\ndifferent parts of the terrella. {82} For since attraction is coition\r\ntowards a body, but magneticks run together by their versatory tendency, it\r\ncomes about that in the diameter drawn from pole to pole the body appeals\r\ndirectly, but in other places less directly. So the less the magnetick is\r\nturned toward the body, the less, and the more feebly, does it approach and\r\nadhære. [Illustration] Just as if A B were the poles and a bar of iron or a\r\nmagnetick fragment C is allured at the part E; yet the end laid hold of\r\ndoes not tend towards the centre of the loadstone, but verges obliquely\r\ntowards the pole; and a chord drawn from that end obliquely as the\r\nattracted body tends is short; therefore it has less vigour and likewise\r\nless inclination. But as a greater chord proceeds from a body at F, so its\r\naction is stronger; at G still longer; longest at A, the pole (for the\r\ndiameter is the longest way) to which all the parts from all sides bring\r\nassistance, in which is constituted, as it were, the citadel and tribunal\r\nof the whole province, not from any worth of its own, but because a force\r\nresides in it contributed from all the other parts, just as all the\r\nsoldiers bring help to their own commander. Wherefore also a slightly\r\nlonger stone attracts more than a spherical one, since the length from pole\r\nto pole is extended, even if the stones are both from the same mine and of\r\nthe same weight and size. The way from pole to pole is longer in a longer\r\nstone, and the forces brought together from other parts are not so\r\nscattered as in a round magnet and terrella, and in a narrow one they agree\r\nmore and are better united, and a united stronger force excels and is\r\npreeminent. A much weaker office, however, does a plane or oblong stone\r\nperform, when the length is extended according to the leading of the\r\nparallels, and the pole stops neither on the apex nor in the circle and\r\norbe, but is spread over the flat. Wherefore also it invites a friend\r\nwretchedly, and feebly retains him, so that it is esteemed as one of an\r\nabject and contemptible class, according to its less apt and less suitable\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{83} CHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe Magnetick Virtue which is conceived in Iron is\r\nmore apparent in an iron rod than in a piece of iron that\r\n_is round, square, or of other figure_.\r\n\r\nDuly was it said before that the longer magnet attracts the greater weight\r\nof iron[167]; so also in a longish piece of iron which has been touched the\r\nmagnetick force conceived is stronger when the poles exist at the ends. For\r\nthe magnetick forces which are driven from the whole in every part into the\r\npoles are not scattered but united in the narrow ends. In square and other\r\nangular figures the influence is dissipated, and does not proceed in\r\nstraight lines or in convenient arcs. Suppose also an iron globe have the\r\nshape of the earth, yet for the same reasons it drags magnetick substances\r\nless; wherefore a small iron sphere, when excited, draws another piece of\r\niron more sluggishly than an excited rod of equal weight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nShowing that Movements take place by the Magnetical\r\nVigour though solid bodies lie between; and on\r\n_the interposition of iron plates_.\r\n\r\nFloat a piece of iron wire on the surface of water by transfixing it\r\nthrough a suitable cork; or set a versatory piece of iron on a pin or in a\r\nseaman's compass (a magnet being brought near or moved about underneath),\r\nit is put into a state of motion; neither the water, nor the vessel, nor\r\nthe compass-box offering resistance in any way. Thick boards do not\r\nobstruct[168], nor earthen vessels nor marble vases, nor the metals\r\nthemselves; nothing is so solid as to carry away or impede the forces\r\nexcepting an iron plate. Everything which is interposed (even though it is\r\nvery dense) does not carry away its influence or obstruct its path, or\r\nindeed in any way hinder, diminish, or retard it. But all the force is not\r\nsuppressed by an iron plate, but it is in some measure diverted aside. For\r\nwhen the vigour passes into the middle of an iron plate within the orbe of\r\nthe magnetick virtue or placed just {84} opposite the pole of the stone,\r\nthat virtue is scattered in very large measure towards its extremities; so\r\nthat the edges of a small round * plate of suitable size allure iron wires\r\non every side. This is also apparent in the case of a long iron wand,\r\nwhich, when it has been touched by a magnet in the middle, has a like\r\nverticity at either end. *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nB is a loadstone, C D a long rod magnetized in the middle A; E being the\r\nBoreal pole; C is an Austral end or pole; in like manner also the end D is\r\nanother Austral pole. But observe here the exactness with which a versorium\r\ntouched by a pole, when a round plate is interposed, turns towards the same\r\npole in the same * way as before the interposition, only weaker; the plate\r\nnot standing in the way, because the vigour is diverted through the edges\r\nof the small plate, and passes out of its straight course, but yet the\r\nplate retains in the middle the same verticity, when it is in the\r\nneighbourhood of that pole, and close to it; wherefore the versorium tends\r\ntowards the plate, having been touched by the same pole. If a loadstone is\r\nrather weak, a versorium hardly turns when a plate is put in between; for\r\nthe vigour of the rather weak loadstone, being diffused through the\r\nextremities, passes less through the * middle. But if the plate has been\r\ntouched in this way by a pole in the middle and has been removed from the\r\nstone outside its orbe of virtue, then you will see the point of the same\r\nversorium tend in the contrary direction and desert the centre of the small\r\nplate, which formerly it desired; for outside the orbe of virtue it has an\r\nopposite verticity, in the vicinity the same; for in the vicinity it is, as\r\nit were, a part of the loadstone, and has the same pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA is an iron plate near the pole, B a versorium which tends with its point\r\ntowards the centre of the small plate, which has been touched by the pole\r\nof the loadstone C. But if the same small plate be {85} placed outside the\r\norbe of magnetick virtue, the point will not turn towards its centre, but\r\nthe cross E of the same versorium does. But an iron globe interposed (if it\r\nis not too large) attracts the * point of the iron on the other side of the\r\nstone. For the verticity of that side is the same as that of the adjoining\r\npole of the stone. And this turning of the cusp (that is, of the end\r\ntouched by that pole) as well as of the cross-end, at a greater distance,\r\ntakes place with an iron globe interposed, which would not happen at all if\r\n* the space were empty, because the magnetick virtue is passed on and\r\ncontinued through magnetick bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA is a terrella, B an iron globe; between the two bodies is F, a versorium\r\nwhose point has been excited by the pole C. In the other figure A is a\r\nterrella, C its pole, B an iron globe; where the versorium tends towards C,\r\nthe pole of the terrella, through the iron globe. So a versorium placed\r\nbetween a terrella and an iron globe vibrates more forcibly towards the\r\npole of the terrella; because the loadstone sends an instantaneous\r\nverticity into the opposite globe. There is the same efficiency in the\r\nearth, produced from the same cause. For if a revolvable needle is shut up\r\nin a rather thick gold box (this metal indeed excels all others in density)\r\nor a glass or stone box, nevertheless that magnetick needle has its forces\r\nconnected and united with the influences of the earth, and the iron will\r\nturn freely and readily (unhindered by its prison) to its desired points,\r\nNorth and South. * It even does this when shut up in iron caverns, if they\r\nare sufficiently spacious. Whatever bodies are produced among us, or are\r\nartificially forged from things which are produced, consist of matter of\r\nthe terrestrial globe; nor do those bodies hinder the prime forces of\r\nnature which are derived from their primary form, nor can they resist them\r\nexcept by contrary forms. But no forms of mixed bodies are inimical to the\r\nprimary implanted earth-nature, although some often do not agree[169] with\r\none another. But in the case of all those substances which have a material\r\ncause for their inclining (as amber, {86} jet, sulphur), their action is\r\nimpeded by the interposition of a body (as paper, leaves, glass, or the\r\nlike) when that way is impeded and obstructed, so that that which\r\nexhales[170] cannot reach the corpuscle to be allured. Terrestrial and\r\nmagnetick coition and motion, when corporeal impediments are interposed, is\r\ndemonstrated also by the efficiencies of other chief bodies due to their\r\nprimary form. The moon (more than all the stars) agrees with internal parts\r\nof the earth on account of its nearness and similarity in form. The moon\r\nproduces the movements of the waters and the tides of the sea; twice it\r\nfills up the shores and empties them whilst it moves from a certain\r\ndefinite point in the sky back to the same point in a daily revolution.\r\nThis motion of the waters is incited and the seas rise and fall no less\r\nwhen the moon is below the horizon and in the lowest part of the heavens,\r\nthan if it had been raised at a height above the horizon. So the whole mass\r\nof the earth interposed[171] does not resist the action of the moon, when\r\nit is below the earth; but the seas bordering on our shores, in certain\r\npositions of the sky when it is below the horizon, are kept in motion, and\r\nlikewise stirred by its power (though they are not struck by its rays nor\r\nilluminated by its light), rise, come up with great force, and recede. But\r\nabout the reason of the tides anon[172]; here let it suffice to have merely\r\ntouched the threshold of the question. In like manner nothing on the earth\r\ncan be hidden from the magnetick disposition of the earth or of the stone,\r\nand all magnetical bodies are reduced to order by the dominant form of the\r\nearth, and loadstone and iron show sympathy with a loadstone though solid\r\nbodies be interposed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOn the Iron Cap of a Loadstone, with which\r\nit is armed at the pole (for the sake of the\r\n_virtue) and on the efficacy of the same._\r\n\r\nConceive a small round plate, concave in shape, of the breadth of a digit\r\nto be applied to the convex polar surface of a loadstone and skilfully\r\nattached; or a piece of iron shaped like an acorn, rising from the base\r\ninto an obtuse cone, hollowed out a little and fitted to the surface of the\r\nstone, to be tied to the loadstone. Let the iron be the best steel,\r\nsmoothed, shining, and even. A loadstone with such an appliance, which\r\nbefore only bore four ounces of iron, will now raise twelve. But the\r\ngreatest force of a combining or rather united nature is seen {87} when two\r\nloadstones, armed with iron caps, are so joined by their concurrent\r\n(commonly called contrary) ends, that they mutually * attract and raise one\r\nanother. In this way a weight of twenty ounces is raised, when either stone\r\nunarmed would only allure four ounces of iron. Iron unites to an armed\r\nloadstone more firmly than to a loadstone; and on that account raises\r\ngreater weights, because the pieces of iron stick more pertinaciously to\r\none that is armed. For by the near presence of the magnet they are cemented\r\ntogether, and since the armature[173] conceives a magnetick vigour from its\r\npresence and the other conjoined piece of iron is at the same time endued\r\nwith vigour from the presence of the loadstone, they are firmly bound\r\ntogether. Therefore by the mutual contact of strong pieces of iron, the\r\ncohesion is strong. Which thing is also made clear and is exhibited by\r\nmeans of rods sticking together, Bk. 3, chap 4[174]; and also when the\r\nquestion of the concretion of iron dust into a united body was discussed.\r\nFor this reason a piece of iron set near a loadstone draws away any\r\nsuitable piece of iron from the loadstone, if only it touch the iron;\r\notherwise it does not snatch it away, though in closest proximity. For\r\nmagnetick pieces of iron within the orbe of virtue, or near a loadstone, do\r\nnot rush together with a greater endeavour[175] than the iron and the\r\nmagnet; but joined they are united more strongly and, as it were, cemented\r\ntogether, though the substance remain the same with the same forces acting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

But if the same loadstone\r\nbe unarmed, it will draw the cylinder rolling with the same speed as the\r\narmed loadstone with the paper between or when it was wrapped in paper.\r\n\r\nArmed loadstones of diverse weights, of the same ore vigour * and form,\r\ncling and hang to pieces of iron of a convenient size and proportionate\r\nfigure with an equal proportion of strength. The same is apparent in the\r\ncase of unarmed stones. A suitable piece * of iron being applied to the\r\nlower part of a loadstone, which is * hanging from a magnetick body,\r\nexcites its vigour, so that the loadstone hangs on more firmly. For a\r\npendent loadstone clings {90} more firmly to a magnetick body joined to it\r\nabove with a hanging piece of iron added to it, than when lead or any other\r\nnon-magnetick body is hung on.\r\n\r\nA loadstone, whether armed or unarmed, * joined by its proper pole to the\r\npole of another loadstone, armed or unarmed, makes the loadstone raise a\r\ngreater weight by the opposite end[177]. A piece of iron also applied to\r\nthe pole of a magnet produces the same result, namely, that the other pole\r\nwill carry a greater weight of iron; just as a loadstone with a piece of\r\niron superposed on it (as in this figure) holds up a piece of iron below,\r\nwhich it cannot hold, if the upper one be removed. * Magneticks in\r\nconjunction make one magnetick. Wherefore as the mass increases, the\r\nmagnetick vigour is also augmented.\r\n\r\nAn armed loadstone, as well as an unarmed * one, runs more readily to a\r\nlarger piece of iron and combines more firmly with a larger piece than with\r\na lesser one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nMagnetick Force causes motion towards unity,\r\n_and binds firmly together bodies which are united_.\r\n\r\nMagnetick fragments cohære within their strength well and harmoniously\r\ntogether. Pieces of iron in the presence of a loadstone (even if they are\r\nnot * touching the loadstone) run together, seek one another anxiously and\r\nembrace one another, and when joined are as if they were cemented. Iron *\r\nfilings or the same reduced to powder inserted in paper tubes, placed upon\r\na stone meridionally or merely brought rather close to it, coalesce into\r\none body, and so many parts suddenly are concreted * and combine; and the\r\nwhole company of corpuscles thus conspiring together affects another piece\r\nof iron and attracts it, as if it constituted one integral rod of iron; and\r\nabove the stone it is directed toward the North and South. But when they\r\nare removed a long * {91} way from the stone, the particles (as if loosed\r\nagain) are separated and move apart singly. In this way also the\r\nfoundations of the world are connected and joined and cemented together\r\nmagnetically. So let Ptolemy of Alexandria, and his followers, and those\r\nphilosophers of ours, be the less terrified if the earth do move round in a\r\ncircle, nor threaten its dissolution.\r\n\r\nIron filings, after being heated for a long time, are attracted by a\r\nloadstone, yet not so strongly or from so great a distance as when not\r\nheated. A loadstone loses some of its virtue by too great a heat; for its\r\nhumour is set free, whence its peculiar nature is marred. Likewise also, if\r\niron filings are well burnt in a reverberatory furnace and converted into\r\nsaffron of Mars, they are not attracted by a loadstone; but if they are\r\nheated, but not thoroughly burnt, they do stick to a magnet, but less\r\nstrongly than the filings themselves not acted upon by fire. For the\r\nsaffron has become totally deformate, but the heated metal acquires a\r\ndefect from the fire, and the forces in the enfeebled body are less excited\r\nby a loadstone; and, the nature of the iron being now ruined, it is not\r\nattracted by a loadstone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIIII.\r\n\r\nA piece of Iron placed within the Orbe of a\r\nLoadstone hangs suspended in the air, if on account\r\n_of some impediment it cannot approach it_.\r\n\r\nWithin the magnetick orbe a piece of iron moves towards the more powerful\r\npoints of the stone, if it be not hindered by force or by the material of a\r\nbody placed between them; either it falls down from above, or tends\r\nsideways or obliquely, or flies up above. But if the iron cannot reach the\r\nstone on account of some obstacle, it cleaves to it and remains there, but\r\nwith a less firm and constant connection, since at greater intervals or\r\ndistances the alliance is less amicable. Fracastorio, in the eighth chapter\r\nof his _De Sympathia_, says that a piece of iron is suspended in the air,\r\nso that it can be moved neither up nor down, if a loadstone be placed above\r\nwhich is able to draw the iron up just as much as the iron itself inclines\r\ndownwards with equal force; for thus the iron would be supported in the\r\nair: which thing is absurd; because the force of a magnet is {92} always\r\nthe stronger the nearer it is. So that when a piece of iron is raised a\r\nvery little from the earth by the force of the magnet, it needs must be\r\ndrawn steadily on towards the magnet (if nothing else come in the way) and\r\ncleave to it. Baptista Porta suspends a piece of iron in the air[178] (a\r\nmagnet being fixed above), and, by no very subtile process, the iron is\r\ndetained by a slender thread from its lower part, so that it cannot rise up\r\nto the stone. The iron is raised upright by the magnet, although the magnet\r\ndoes not * touch the iron, but because it is in its vicinity; but when the\r\nwhole iron on account of its greater nearness is moved by that which\r\nerected it, immediately it hurries with a swift motion to the magnet and\r\ncleaves to it. For by approaching the iron is more and more excited, and\r\nthe coition grows stronger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXV.\r\n\r\nExaltation of the power of the Magnet.\r\n\r\nOne loadstone far surpasses another in power, since one draws iron of\r\nalmost its own weight, another can hardly stir some shreds. Whatever\r\nthings, whether animals or plants, are endowed with life need some sort of\r\nnourishment, by which their strength not only persists but grows firmer and\r\nmore vigorous. But iron is not, as it seemed to Cardan and to Alexander\r\nAphrodiseus, attracted by the loadstone in order that it may feed on shreds\r\nof it, nor does the loadstone take up vigour from iron filings as if by a\r\nrepast on victuals. Since Porta had doubts on this and resolved to test it,\r\nhe took a loadstone of ascertained weight, and buried it in iron filings of\r\nnot unknown weight; and when he had left it there for many months, he found\r\nthe stone of greater weight, the filings of less. But the difference was so\r\nslender that he was even then doubtful as to the truth. What was done by\r\nhim does not convict the stone of voracity, nor does it show any nutrition;\r\nfor minute portions of the filings are easily scattered in handling. So\r\nalso a very fine dust is insensibly born on a loadstone in some very slight\r\nquantity, by which something might have been added to the weight of the\r\nloadstone but which is only a surface accretion and might even be wiped off\r\nwith no great difficulty. Some think that a weak and sluggish stone can\r\nbring itself back into better condition, and that a very powerful one also\r\nmight present it with the highest powers. Do they acquire strength like\r\nanimals when {93} they eat and are sated? Is the medicine prepared by\r\naddition or subtraction? Is there anything which can re-create this primary\r\nform or bestow it anew? And, certes, nothing can do this which is not\r\nmagnetical. Magneticks can restore a certain soundness to magneticks (when\r\nnot incurable); some can even exalt them beyond their proper strength; but\r\nwhen a body is at the height of perfection in its own nature, it is not\r\ncapable of being strengthened further. So that that imposture of\r\nParacelsus, who affirms that the force and virtue can be increased and\r\ntransmuted tenfold, turns out to be the more infamous. The method of\r\neffecting this is as follows, viz., you make it semi-incandescent in a fire\r\nof charcoal (that is, you heat it very hot), so that it does not become\r\nred-hot, however, and immediately slake it, as much indeed as it can\r\nimbibe, in oil of saffron of Mars, made from the best Carynthian steel. \"In\r\nthis way you will be able so to strengthen a loadstone that it can draw a\r\nnail out of a wall and accomplish many other like wonderful things, which\r\nare not possible for a common loadstone.\" But a loadstone thus slaked in\r\noil not only does not gain power, but suffers also a certain loss of its\r\ninborn strength. A loadstone is improved if polished and rubbed with steel.\r\nBuried in filings of the best iron or of pure steel, not rusty, it\r\npreserves its strength. Sometimes also a somewhat good and strong one gains\r\n[Illustration] some strength when it is rubbed on the pole of another, on\r\nthe opposite part, and receives virtue. In all these experiments it is an\r\nadvantage to observe the pole of the earth, and to adjust according to\r\nmagnetick laws the stone which we wish to strengthen; which we shall set\r\nforth below. A somewhat powerful and fairly large loadstone increases the\r\nstrength of a loadstone as it does of iron. A loadstone being placed over\r\nthe boreal pole of a loadstone, * {94} the boreal pole becomes stronger,\r\nand an iron rod (like an arrow) sticks to the boreal pole A, but not at all\r\nto the pole B. The pole A also, when it is at the top in a right line with\r\nthe axis of both loadstones joined in accordance with magnetick laws,\r\nraises the rod to the perpendicular, which it cannot do if the large\r\nloadstone be removed, on account of its own weaker strength. But as a small\r\niron globe, when placed above the pole of a terrella, raises the rod to the\r\n* perpendicular, so, when placed at the side, the rod is not directed\r\ntowards the centre of the globe, but is raised obliquely and cleaves\r\nanywhere, because the pole in a round piece of iron is always the point\r\nwhich is joined most closely to the pole of the terrella and is not\r\nconstant as in a smaller terrella. The parts of the earth, as of all\r\nmagneticks, are in agreement and take delight in their mutual proximity; if\r\nplaced in the highest power, they do not harm their inferiors, nor slight\r\nthem; there is a mutual love among them all, a perennial good feeling. The\r\nweaker loadstones are re-created by the more powerful, and the less\r\npowerful cause no harm to the stronger. But a powerful one attracts and\r\nturns a somewhat strong one more than it does an impotent one. Because a\r\nstrenuous one confers a stronger activity, and itself hastens, flies up to\r\nthe other, and solicits it more keenly; therefore there is a more certain\r\nand a stronger co-action and cohærency.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVI.\r\n\r\nWhy there should appear to be a greater love between\r\n_iron and loadstone, than between loadstone and loadstone, or_\r\nbetween iron and iron, when close to the loadstone,\r\n_within its orbe of virtue._\r\n\r\nMagnet attracts magnet, not in every part and on every side with equal\r\nconditions, as iron, but at one and a fixed point; therefore the poles of\r\nboth must be exactly disposed, otherwise they do not cleave together duly\r\nand strongly. But this disposition is not easy and expeditious; wherefore a\r\nloadstone seems not to conform to a loadstone, when nevertheless they agree\r\nvery well together. A piece of iron by the sudden impression of a loadstone\r\nis not only allured by the stone, but is renewed, its forces being drawn\r\nforth; by which it follows and solicits the loadstone with no less impulse,\r\nand even leads another piece of iron captive. Let there be a small iron\r\nspike above a loadstone clinging firmly to it; if you apply an unmagnetized\r\nrod of iron to the spike, not, however, {95} so that it touches the stone,\r\nyou will see the spike when it has touched the iron, leaving the loadstone,\r\nfollow the rod, try to grasp it by leaning toward it, and (if it should\r\ntouch it) cleave firmly to it: for a piece of iron, when united and joined\r\nto another piece of iron placed within the orbe of virtue of the loadstone,\r\ndraws it more strongly than does the loadstone itself. The natural\r\nmagnetick virtue, confused and dormant in the iron, is aroused by the\r\nloadstone, is linked to the loadstone, and rejoices with it in its primary\r\nform; then smelted iron becomes a perfect magnetick, as robust as the\r\nloadstone itself. For as the one imparts and stirs, so the other conceives,\r\nand being stirred remains in virtue, and pours back the forces also by its\r\nown activity. But since iron is more like iron than loadstone, and the\r\nvirtue in both pieces of iron is exalted by the proximity of the loadstone,\r\nso in the loadstone itself, in case of equal strength, likeness of\r\nsubstance prevails, and iron gives itself up rather to iron, and they are\r\nunited by their very similar homogenic powers. Which thing happens not so\r\nmuch from a coition, as from a firmer unition; and a knob or snout of\r\nsteel, fixed skilfully on the pole of the stone, raises greater weights of\r\niron than the stone of itself could. When steel or iron is smelted from\r\nloadstone or iron ore, the slag and corrupt substances are separated from\r\nthe better by the fusion of the material; whence (in very large measure)\r\nthat iron contains the nature of the earth, purified from alien flaw and\r\nblemish, and more homogenic and perfect, though deformed by the fusion. And\r\nwhen that material indeed is provoked by a loadstone, it conceives the\r\nmagnetick virtues, and within their orbe is raised in strength more than\r\nthe weaker loadstone, which with us is often not free from some admixture\r\nof impurities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVII.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nThe Centre of the Magnetick Virtues in the earth\r\nis the centre of the earth; and in a terrella\r\n_is the centre of the stone_.\r\n\r\nRays of magnetick virtue spread out in every direction in an orbe; the\r\ncentre of this orbe is not at the pole (as Baptista Porta reckons, Chap.\r\n22), but in the centre of the stone and of the terrella. So also the centre\r\nof the earth is the centre of the magnetick motions of the earth; though\r\nmagneticks are not borne directly toward the centre by magnetical motion,\r\nexcept when they are attracted by the true pole. For since the formal {96}\r\npower of the stone and of the earth does not promote anything but the unity\r\nand conformity of disjoined bodies, it comes about that everywhere at an\r\nequal distance from the centre or from the circumference, just as it seems\r\nto attract perpendicularly at one place, so at another it is able even to\r\ndispose and to turn, provided the stone is not uneven in virtue. For if at\r\nthe distance C from the pole D the stone is able to allure a versorium, *\r\nat an equally long interval above the æquator at A that stone can also\r\ndirect and turn the versorium. So the very centre and middle of the\r\nterrella is the centre of its virtue, and from this to the circumference of\r\nthe orbe (at equal intervals on every side) its magnetick virtues are\r\nemitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXVIII.\r\n\r\nA Loadstone attracts magneticks not only to a\r\nfixed point or pole, but to every part of a\r\n_terrella save the æquinoctial zone_.\r\n\r\nCoitions are always more powerful when poles are near poles, since in them\r\nby the concordancy of the whole there exists a stronger force; wherefore\r\nthe one embraces the other more strongly. Places declining from the poles\r\nhave attractive forces, but a little weaker and languid in the ratio of\r\ntheir distance; so that at length on the æquinoctial circle they are\r\nutterly enervated and evanescent. Neither do even the poles attract as\r\nmathematical points; nor do magneticks come into conjunction by their own\r\npoles, only on the poles of a loadstone. But coition {97} is made on every\r\npart of the periphery, both Northern and Southern, by virtue emanating from\r\nthe whole body; magneticks nevertheless incline languidly towards\r\nmagneticks in the parts bordering on the æquator, but quickly in places\r\nnearer the pole. Wherefore not the poles, not the parts alone nearest to\r\nthe pole allure and invite magneticks, but magneticks are disposed and\r\nturned round and combine with magneticks in proportion as the parts facing\r\nand adjoined unite their forces together, which are always of the same\r\npotency in the same parallel, unless they are distributed otherwise from\r\ncauses of variation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIX.\r\n\r\nOn Variety of Strength due to Quantity\r\n_or Mass_.\r\n\r\nQuite similar in potency are those stones which are of the same mine, and\r\nnot corrupted by adjacent ores or veins. Nevertheless that which excels in\r\nsize shows greater powers, since it seizes greater weights and has a wider\r\norbe of virtue. For a loadstone weighing one ounce does not lift a large\r\nnail as does one weighing a pound, nor does it rule so widely, nor extend\r\nits forces; and if from a loadstone of a pound weight a portion is taken\r\naway, something of its power will be seen to go also; for when a portion is\r\nabstracted the virtue is lessened. But if that part is properly applied and\r\nunited to it, though it is not fastened * to nor grown into it, yet by the\r\napplication it obtains its pristine power and its vigour returns.\r\nSometimes, however, when a part is taken away, the virtue turns out to be\r\nstronger on account of the * bad shape of the stone, namely, when the\r\nvigour is scattered through inconvenient angles. In various species the\r\nratio is various, for one stone of a drachm weight draws more than another\r\nof twenty pounds. Since in very many the influence is so effete that it can\r\nhardly be perceived, those weak stones are surpassed by prepared pieces of\r\nclay. But, it may be asked[179], if a stone of the same species and\r\ngoodness weighing a drachm would seize upon a drachm of iron, would a stone\r\nof an ounce weight seize on an ounce, a pound on a pound, and so on? And\r\nthis is indeed true; for it both strains and remits its strength\r\nproportionately, so that if a loadstone, one drachm of which would attract\r\none drachm of iron, were in equal proportion applied either to a suitably\r\nlarge obelisk or to an immense pyramid of iron, it would lift it directly\r\nin such {98} proportion and would draw it towards itself with no greater\r\neffort of its nature or trouble than a loadstone of a drachm weight\r\nembraces a drachm. But in all such experiments as this let the vigour of\r\nthe magnets be equal; let there be also a just proportion in all of the\r\nshapes of the stones, and let the shape of the iron to be attracted be the\r\nsame, and the goodness of the metal, and let the position of the poles of\r\nthe loadstones be most exact. This is also no less true in the case of an\r\narmed loadstone than of an unarmed one. For the sake of experiment, let\r\nthere be given a loadstone of eight ounces weight, which when armed lifts\r\ntwelve ounces of iron; if you cut off from that loadstone a certain\r\nportion, which when it has been * reduced to the shape of the former whole\r\none is then only of two ounces, such a loadstone armed lifts a piece of\r\niron applied to it of three ounces, in proportion to the mass. In this\r\nexperiment also the piece of iron of three ounces ought to have the same\r\nshape as the former one of twelve ounces; if that rose up into a cone, it\r\nis necessary that this also in the ratio of its mass should be given a\r\npyramidal shape proportioned to the former.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXX.\r\n\r\nThe Shape and Mass of the Iron are of most\r\n_importance in coition_.\r\n\r\nObservation has shown above that the shape and mass of the loadstone have\r\ngreat influence in magnetick coitions; likewise also the shape and mass of\r\nthe iron bodies give back more powerful and steady forces. Oblong iron rods\r\nare both drawn more quickly to a loadstone and cleave to it with greater\r\nobstinacy than round or square pieces, for the same reasons which we have\r\nproven in the case of the loadstone. But, moreover, this is also worthy of\r\nobservation, that a smaller piece of iron, to which is hung a weight of\r\nanother material, so that it is altogether in weight equal to another large\r\nwhole piece of iron of a right weight * (as regards the strength of the\r\nloadstone), is not lifted by the loadstone as the larger piece of iron\r\nwould be. For a smaller piece of iron does not join with a loadstone so\r\nfirmly, because it sends back less strength, and only that which is\r\nmagnetick conceives strength; the foreign material hung on cannot acquire\r\nmagnetick forces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{99} CHAP. XXXI.\r\n\r\nOn Long and Round Stones.\r\n\r\nPieces of iron join more firmly with a long stone than with a round one,\r\nprovided that the pole of the stone is at the extremity and end of its\r\nlength; because, forsooth, in the case of a long stone, a magnetick is\r\ndirected at the end straight towards the body in which the virtue proceeds\r\nin straighter lines and through the longer diameter. But a somewhat long\r\nstone has but little power on the side, much less indeed than a round one.\r\nIt is demonstrable[180], indeed, that at A and B the coition is * stronger\r\nin a round stone than at C and D, at like distances from the pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXII.\r\n\r\nCertain Problems and Magnetick Experiments about\r\nthe Coition, and Separation, and regular Motion\r\n_of bodies magnetical_.\r\n\r\nEqual loadstones come together with equal incitation. *\r\n\r\nAlso magnetick bodies of iron, if alike in all respects, * come together\r\nwhen excited with similar incitation.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, bodies of iron not excited by a * loadstone, if they are alike\r\nand not weighed down by their bulk, move towards one another with equal\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nTwo loadstones, disposed on the surface of some water in {100} suitable\r\nskiffs, if they are drawn up suitably within their orbes of virtue, incite\r\none another mutually to an embrace. So a proportionate * piece of iron in\r\none skiff hurries with the same speed towards the loadstone as the\r\nloadstone itself in its boat strives towards the iron. From their own\r\npositions, indeed, they are so borne together, that they are joined and\r\ncome to rest at length in the middle of the space. Two iron wires\r\nmagnetically excited, floating in water by means of * suitable pieces of\r\ncork, strive to touch and mutually strike one another with their\r\ncorresponding ends, and are conjoined.\r\n\r\nCoition is firmer and swifter than repulsion and separation in * equal\r\nmagnetick substances. That magnetick substances are more sluggishly\r\nrepelled than they are attracted is manifest in all magnetical experiments\r\nin the case of stones floating on water in suitable skiffs; also in the\r\ncase of iron wires or rods swimming (transfixed through corks) and well\r\nexcited by a loadstone, and in the case of versoria. This comes about\r\nbecause, though there is one faculty of coition, another of conformation or\r\ndisposition, repulsion and aversion is caused merely by something\r\ndisposing; on the other hand, the coming together is by a mutual alluring\r\nto contact and a disposing, that is, by a double vigour.\r\n\r\nA disponent vigour is often only the precursor of coition, in order that\r\nthe bodies may stand conveniently for one another before conjunction;\r\nwherefore also they are turned round to the corresponding ends, if they can\r\n[not][181] reach them through the hindrances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf a loadstone be divided through a meridian into two equal parts, the\r\nseparate parts mutually repel one another, the poles being * placed\r\ndirectly opposite one another at a convenient and equal distance. They\r\nrepel one another also with a greater velocity than when pole is put\r\nopposite pole incongruously. Just as the part B of the loadstone, placed\r\nalmost opposite the part A, repels it floating in its skiff, because D\r\nturns away from F, and E from C; but if B is exactly joined with A again,\r\nthey agree and become one body {101} magnetical; but in proximity they\r\nraise enmities. But if one part of the stone is turned round, so that C\r\nfaces D and F faces E, then A pursues B within its orbe until they are\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nThe Southern parts of the stone avoid the Southern parts, and the Northern\r\nparts the Northern. Nevertheless, if by force you move up the Southern cusp\r\nof a piece of iron too near the Southern part of the stone, the cusp is\r\nseized and both are linked together in friendly embraces: because it\r\nimmediately reverses the implanted verticity of the iron, and it is changed\r\nby the presence of the more powerful stone, which is more constant in its\r\nforces than the iron. For they come together according to their nature, if\r\nby reversal and mutation true conformity is produced, and just coition, as\r\nalso regular direction. Loadstones of the same shape, size, and vigour,\r\nattract one another mutually with like efficacy, and in the opposite\r\nposition repel one another mutually with a like vigour.\r\n\r\nIron rods not touched, though alike and equal, do yet often act * upon one\r\nanother with different forces; because as the reasons of their acquired\r\nverticity, also of their stability and vigour, are different, so the more\r\nstrongly they are excited, the more vigorously do they incite.\r\n\r\nPieces of iron excited by one and the same pole mutually repel * one\r\nanother by those ends at which they were excited; then also the opposite\r\nends to those in these iron pieces raise enmities one to another.\r\n\r\nIn versoria whose cusps have been rubbed, but not their cross-ends, * the\r\ncrosses mutually repel one another, but weakly and in proportion to their\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIn like versoria the cusps, having been touched by the same * pole of the\r\nloadstone, attract the cross-ends with equal strength.\r\n\r\nIn a somewhat long versorium the cross-end is attracted rather * weakly by\r\nthe cusp of a shorter iron versorium; the cross of the shorter more\r\nstrongly by the cusp of the longer, because the cross of the longer\r\nversorium has a weak verticity, but the cusp has a stronger.\r\n\r\nThe cusp of a longer versorium drives away the cusp of a * shorter one more\r\nvehemently than the cusp of the shorter the cusp of the longer, if the one\r\nis free upon a pin, and the other is held in the hand; for though both were\r\nequally excited by the same loadstone, yet the longer one is stronger at\r\nits cusp on account of its greater mass.\r\n\r\nThe Southern end of an iron rod which is not excited attracts * the\r\nNorthern, and the Northern the Southern; moreover, also the Southern parts\r\nrepel the Southern, and the Northern the Northern.\r\n\r\nIf magnetick substances are divided or in any way broken in pieces, each\r\npart has a Northern and a Southern end.\r\n\r\n{102} A versorium is moved as far off by a loadstone when an obstacle * is\r\nput in the way, as through air and an open medium.\r\n\r\nRods rubbed upon the pole of a stone strive after the same pole * and\r\nfollow it. Therefore Baptista Porta errs when he says, chapter 40[182], \"If\r\nyou put that part to it from which it received its force, it will not\r\nendure it, but drives it from it, and draws to it the contrary and opposite\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nThe principles of turning round and inclining are the same in the case of\r\nloadstone to loadstone, of loadstone to iron, of iron also to iron.\r\n\r\nWhen magnetick substances which have been separated by force and dissected\r\ninto parts flow together into a true union and are suitably connected, the\r\nbody becomes one, and one united virtue, nor have they diverse ends.\r\n\r\nThe separate parts assume two opposite poles, if the division has * not\r\nbeen made along a parallel: if the division has been made along a parallel,\r\nthey are able to retain one pole in the same site as before.\r\n\r\nPieces of iron which have been rubbed and excited by a loadstone are more\r\nsurely and swiftly seized by a loadstone at fitting ends than such as have\r\nnot been rubbed.\r\n\r\nIf a spike is set up on the pole of a loadstone, a spike or style * of iron\r\nplaced on the upper end is strongly cemented to it, and draws away the\r\nerect spike from the terrella when motion is made.\r\n\r\nIf to the lower end of the erect spike the end of another spike * is\r\napplied, it does not cohære with it, nor do they unite together.\r\n\r\nAs a rod of iron draws away a piece of iron from a terrella, so is it also\r\nwith a minute loadstone and a lesser terrella, though weaker in strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe piece of iron C comes into conjunction with the terrella A, and the\r\nvigour in it is magnetically exalted and excited, both in the adjoining end\r\nand in the other also which is turned away through {103} its conjunction\r\nwith the terrella. The end that is turned away also conceives vigour from\r\nthe loadstone B; likewise the pole D of that loadstone is powerful on\r\naccount of its suitable aspect and the nearness of the pole E of the\r\nterrella. Several causes therefore concur why the piece of iron C should\r\ncleave to the terrella B, to which it is joined more firmly than to the\r\nterrella A; the vigour excited in the rod, the vigour also excited in the\r\nstone B, and the strength implanted in B concur; therefore D is more firmly\r\ncemented magnetically with C than E with C.\r\n\r\nBut if you were to turn the vertex F round to the iron C, C would not\r\nadhære to F as formerly to D; for stones so arranged being within the orbe\r\nof virtue are placed contrary to natural order; wherefore F does not\r\nreceive power from E.\r\n\r\nTwo loadstones or excited pieces of iron, duly cohæring, fly * asunder on\r\nthe approach of another more powerful loadstone or magnetized piece of\r\niron. Because the new-comer repels the other with its opposing face, and\r\ndominates it, and ends the relationship of the two which were formerly\r\njoined. So the forces of the other are lessened and succumb; but if it\r\nconveniently could, being diverted of its association with the weaker, and\r\nrolling round, it would turn about to the stronger. Wherefore also\r\nmagnetick bodies suspended in the air fall when a loadstone is brought near\r\nthem with an opposing face, not (as Baptista Porta teaches) because the\r\nfaculty of both those which were joined before grows faint and torpid, for\r\nno face can be hostile to both the ends which cohære, but to one only; and\r\nwhen the stronger loadstone, coming fresh with opposing face, impels this\r\nfurther from it, it is put to flight by the friendly reception of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXIII.\r\n\r\nOn the Varying Ratio of Strength, and of the Motion\r\n_of coition, within the orbe of virtue_.\r\n\r\nShould a very large weight, which at a very small distance is drawn towards\r\na loadstone, be divided into ever so many equal parts, and should the\r\nradius of the orbe of magnetick attraction be divided into the same number\r\nof parts, the like named parts of the weight will correspond to the\r\nintermediate parts of the radius.\r\n\r\nThe orbe of virtue extends more widely than the orbe of motion of any\r\nmagnetick; for the magnetick is affected at its extremity, even if it is\r\nnot moved with local motion, which effect is produced {104} by the\r\nloadstone being brought nearer. A small versorium also is turned when a\r\ngood distance off, even if at the same distance it would not flow towards\r\nthe loadstone, though free and disengaged from impediment.\r\n\r\nThe swiftness of the motion of a magnetick body to a loadstone is dependent\r\non either the power of the loadstone, on its mass, on its shape, on the\r\nmedium, or on its distance within the magnetick orbe.\r\n\r\nA magnetick moves more quickly towards a more powerful * stone than towards\r\na sluggish one in proportion to the strength, and [as appears] by a\r\ncomparison of the loadstones together. A lesser mass of iron also is\r\ncarried more quickly towards a loadstone, just as also one that is a little\r\nlonger in shape. The swiftness of magnetick motion towards a loadstone is\r\nchanged by reason of the medium; for bodies are moved more quickly in air\r\nthan in water, and in clear air than in air that is thick and cloudy.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the distance, the motion is quicker in the case of bodies near\r\ntogether than when they are far off. At the limits of the orbe of virtue of\r\na terrella a magnetick is moved feebly and slowly. At very short distances\r\nclose to the terrella the moving impetus is greatest.\r\n\r\nA loadstone which in the outmost part of its orbe of virtue * hardly moves\r\na versorium when one foot removed from it, doth, if a long piece of iron is\r\njoined to it, attract and repel the versorium more strongly with its\r\nopposite poles when even three feet distant. The result is the same whether\r\nthe loadstone is armed or unarmed. Let the iron be a suitable piece of the\r\nthickness of the little finger.\r\n\r\nFor the vigour of the loadstone excites verticity in the iron and proceeds\r\nin the iron and through the iron much further than it extends through the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe vigour proceeds even through several pieces of iron (joined * to one\r\nanother end to end), not so regularly, however, as through one continuous\r\nsolid.\r\n\r\nDust of steel placed upon paper rises up when a loadstone is moved near\r\nabove it in a sort of steely hairiness; but if the loadstone is placed\r\nbelow, such a hairiness is likewise raised.\r\n\r\nSteel dust (when the pole of a loadstone is placed near) is cemented * into\r\none body; but when it desires coition with the loadstone, the mass is split\r\nand it rises in conglomerated parts.\r\n\r\nBut if there is a loadstone beneath the paper, the mass is split in the\r\nsame way and many portions result, each of which consists of very many\r\nparts, and remains cemented together, as individual bodies. Whilst the\r\nlower parts of these pursue greedily the pole of the loadstone placed\r\ndirectly beneath, even they also are raised up as magnetick wholes, just as\r\na small iron wire of the length of a grain or two grains of barley is\r\nraised up, both when the loadstone is moved near both beneath and above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{105} CHAP. XXXIIII.\r\n\r\nWhy a Loadstone should be stronger in its poles\r\nin a different ratio; as well in the Northern\r\n_regions as in the Southern_.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary magnetick virtue of the earth is * remarkably\r\ndemonstrated by the subtility of the following magnetical experiment. Let\r\nthere be given a terrella of no contemptible power, or a long loadstone\r\nwith equal cones as polar extremities; but in any other shape which is not\r\nexactly round error is easy, and the experiment difficult. In the Northern\r\nregions, raise the true North pole of the terrella above the horizon\r\nstraight toward the zenith; it is demonstrable that it raises up a larger\r\niron spike on its North pole, than the South pole of the same terrella is\r\nable to raise, when turned in the same way toward the highest point of the\r\nsky. The same thing is shown by a small terrella placed in the same way\r\nabove a larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet _a b_ be the earth or a somewhat large terrella, also _a b_ a smaller\r\nterrella. There is set up above the Northern pole of the smaller terrella a\r\nspike larger than the pole _b_ of the smaller terrella can raise, if it is\r\nturned round to the higher parts. And the pole _a_ of the {106} smaller\r\nterrella has its strength from the larger, declining from the Zenith to the\r\nplane of the horizon or to the level. But now, if, * leaving the terrella\r\ndisposed in the same way, you bring a piece of iron to the lower and\r\nSouthern pole, it will attract and retain a greater weight than the Boreal\r\npole could, if it were turned round to the lower parts. Which thing is\r\ndemonstrated thus: let A be the earth or a terrella; E the Boreal pole or\r\nsome place in some great latitude; B a rather large terrella above the\r\nearth or a smaller terrella on the top of a larger; D its Southern pole. It\r\nis manifest that D (the Southern pole) attracts a larger piece of iron, C,\r\nthan F (the Boreal pole) will be able to, if it is turned round downward to\r\nthe position D, toward the earth or the terrella in the Northern regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMagneticks acquire strength through magneticks, if they are properly placed\r\naccording to their nature, in near neighbourhood and within the orbe of\r\nvirtue. Wherefore when a terrella is placed on the earth or on a terrella,\r\nso that its Southern pole is turned round toward the Northern pole, its\r\nNorthern pole, however, turned away from the Northern pole, the influence\r\nand strength of {107} its poles are increased. And so the Northern pole of\r\na terrella in such a position lifts up a larger spike than the Southern\r\npole, if the Southern pole is turned away. Similarly the Southern pole in a\r\nproper and natural arrangement, acquiring strength from the earth or from a\r\nlarger terrella, attracts and retains larger rods of iron. In * the other\r\npart of the terrestrial globe toward the South, as also in the Austral\r\nportion of a terrella, the reasoning is converse; for the Southern pole of\r\nthe terrella being turned away is more robust, as also the Northern pole\r\nwhen turned round. The more a region on the earth is distant from the\r\næquinoctial (as also in a larger terrella), the larger is the accession of\r\nstrength perceived; near the æquator, indeed, the difference is small, but\r\non the æquator itself null; at the poles finally it is greatest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXV.\r\n\r\nOn a Perpetual Motion Machine, mentioned\r\nby authors, by means of the attraction\r\n_of a loadstone_.\r\n\r\nCardan writes[183] that out of iron and the Herculean stone can be made a\r\nperpetual motion machine; not that he himself had ever seen one, but only\r\nconceived the idea from an account by Antonius de Fantis[184], of Treves.\r\nSuch a machine he describes, Book 9, _De Rerum Varietate_. But they have\r\nbeen little practised in magnetick experiments who forge such things as\r\nthat. For no magnetick attraction can be greater (by any skill or by any\r\nkind of instrument) than the retention. Things which are joined and those\r\nwhich are approaching near are retained with a greater force than those\r\nwhich are enticed and set in motion, and are moved; and that coition is, as\r\nwe have shown above, a motion of both, not an attraction of one. Such a\r\nmachine Peter Peregrinus feigned many centuries before or else depicted one\r\nwhich he had received from others, and one which was much better fitted for\r\nthe purpose. Johannes Taysnier published it also, spoiled by wretched\r\nfigures, and copied out the whole theory of it word for word. O that the\r\ngods would at length bring to a miserable end such fictitious, crazy,\r\ndeformed labours, with which the minds of the studious are blinded!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{108} CHAP. XXXVI.\r\n\r\nHow a more robust Loadstone may be\r\n_recognized_.\r\n\r\nVery powerful loadstones sometimes lift into the air a weight of iron equal\r\nto their own; a weak one barely attracts a slender wire. Those therefore\r\nare more robust which appeal to and retain larger bodies, if there is no\r\ndefect in their form, or the pole of the stone is not suitably moved up.\r\nMoreover, when placed in a boat a keener influence turns its own poles\r\nround more quickly to the poles of the earth or the limits of variation on\r\nthe horizon. One which performs its function more feebly indicates a defect\r\nand an effete nature. There must always be a similar preparation, a similar\r\nfigure, and a like size; for in such as are very dissimilar and unlike, the\r\nexperiment is doubtful. The method of testing the strength is the same also\r\nwith a versorium in a place somewhat remote from a loadstone; for the one\r\nwhich is able to turn the versorium round at the greater distance, that one\r\nconquers and is held the more potent. Rightly also is the force of a\r\nloadstone weighed in a balance by B. Porta; a piece of loadstone is placed\r\nin one scale-pan, in the other just as much weight of something else, so\r\nthat the scale-pans hang level. Soon a piece of iron lying on the table is\r\nadjusted so that it sticks to the loadstone placed in the scale, and they\r\ncling together most perfectly, according to their friendly points; into the\r\nother scale-pan sand is gradually thrown, and that until the scale in which\r\nthe loadstone is placed is separated from the iron. Thus by weighing the\r\nweight of sand, the magnetick force becomes known. Similarly also it will\r\nbe pleasing to try with another stone, in equilibrium, the weight of the\r\nsand being observed, and to find out the stronger by means of the weights\r\nof sand. Such is the experiment of Cardinal Cusan in his _De\r\nStaticis_[185], from whom it would seem that B. Porta learnt the\r\nexperiment. The better loadstones turn themselves round more quickly toward\r\nthe poles or points of variation; then they also lead along and turn round\r\nmore quickly, according to the greater quantity and mass of wood, a boat\r\nand other stuff. In a declination instrument, the more powerful force of a\r\nloadstone is looked for and required. Those therefore are more lively when\r\nthey get through their work readily, and pass through and come back again\r\nwith speed, and swiftly at length settle at their own point. Languid and\r\neffete ones move more sluggishly[186], settle more tardily, adhære more\r\nuncertainly, and are easily disturbed from their possession.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{109} CHAP. XXXVII.\r\n\r\nUse of a Loadstone as it affects\r\n_iron._\r\n\r\nBy magnetick coition we test iron ore in a blacksmith's forge. It is burnt,\r\nbroken in pieces, washed and dried, in which way it lays down its alien\r\nhumours; in the bits collected from the washing is placed a loadstone,\r\nwhich attracts the iron dust to itself; this, being brushed off with\r\nfeathers, is received in a crucible, and the loadstone is again placed in\r\nthe bits collected from the washing, and the dust wiped off, as long as any\r\nremains which it will attract to itself. This is then heated in the\r\ncrucible along with _sal nitri_[187] until it is liquid, and from this a\r\nsmall mass of iron is cast. But if the loadstone draws the dust to itself\r\nquickly and readily, we conjecture that the iron ore is rich; if slowly,\r\npoor; if it seems altogether to reject it, there is very little iron in it\r\nor none at all. In like manner iron dust can be separated from another\r\nmetal. Many tricks there are also, when iron is secretly applied to lighter\r\nbodies, and, being attracted by the motion of a loadstone which is kept out\r\nof sight, causes movements which are amazing to those who do not know the\r\ncause. Very many such indeed every ingenious mechanician will perform by\r\nsleight of hand, as if by incantations and jugglery[188].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nOn Cases of Attraction in other Bodies.\r\n\r\nVery often the herd of philosophizers and plagiarists repeat from the\r\nrecords of others in natural philosophy opinions and errors about the\r\nattractions of various bodies; as that Diamond attracts iron, and snatches\r\nit away from a magnet; that there are various kinds or magnets, some which\r\nattract gold, others silver, brass, lead; even some which attract flesh,\r\nwater, fishes. The flame of sulphur is said to seek iron and stones; so\r\nwhite naphtha is said to attract fire. I have said above that {110}\r\ninanimate natural bodies do not attract, and are not attracted by, others\r\non the earth, excepting magnetically or electrically. Wherefore it is not\r\ntrue that there are magnets which attract gold or other metals; because a\r\nmagnetick substance draws nothing but magnetick substances. Though\r\nFracastorio says that he has shown a magnet drawing silver; if this were\r\ntrue, it must have happened on account of iron skilfully mixed with that\r\nsilver or concealed in it, or else because nature (as she does sometimes,\r\nbut rarely) had mixed iron with the silver; iron indeed is rarely mixed\r\nwith silver by nature; silver with iron very rarely or never. Iron is mixed\r\nwith silver by forgers of false coin or from the avarice of princes in the\r\ncoining of money, as was the case with the denarius of Antony[189],\r\nprovided that Pliny is recording a true incident. So Cardan (perhaps\r\ndeceived by others) says that there is a certain kind of loadstone which\r\ndraws silver; he adds a most foolish test of this: \"If therefore\" (he says)\r\n\"a slender rod of silver be steeped in that in which a versatory needle has\r\nstood, it will turn toward silver (especially toward a large quantity)\r\nalthough it be buried; by this means anyone will be able easily to dig up\r\nconcealed treasures.\" He adds that \"it should be very good stone, such as\r\nhe has not yet seen.\" Nor indeed will either he or anyone else ever see\r\nsuch a stone or such an experiment. Cardan brings forward an attraction of\r\nflesh, wrongly so named and very dissimilar from that of the loadstone; for\r\nhis _magnes creagus_ or flesh-magnet, from the experiment that it sticks to\r\nthe lips, must be hooted out from the assembly of loadstones, or by all\r\nmeans from the family of things attractive. Lemnian earth, ruddle, and very\r\nmany minerals do this, and yet they are fatuously said to attract. He will\r\nhave it that there is another loadstone, as it were, a third species, into\r\nwhich, if a needle is driven and afterwards stuck into the body, it is not\r\nfelt. But what has attraction to do with stupefaction, or stupor with a\r\nPhilosopher's intellect, when he is discoursing about attraction? There are\r\nmany stones, both found in nature and made by art, which have the power of\r\nstupefying. Sulphur flame is said by some to attract, because it consumes\r\ncertain metals by its power of penetration. So white naphtha attracts\r\nflame, because it gives off and exhales an inflammable vapour, on which\r\naccount it is kindled at some distance, just as the smoke of a recently\r\nextinguished candle takes fire again from another flame; for fire creeps to\r\nfire through an inflammable medium. Why the sucking fish Echineis or the\r\nRemora should stay ships has been variously treated by Philosophers, who\r\nare often accustomed to fit this fable (as many others) to their theories,\r\nbefore they find out whether the thing is so in nature. Therefore, in order\r\nthat they may support and agree with the fatuities of the ancients, they\r\nput forward even the most fatuous ratiocinations and ridiculous problems,\r\ncliffs that attract, where the {111} sucking fish tarry, and the necessity\r\nof some vacuum, I know not what, or how produced. Pliny and Julius Solinus\r\nmake mention of a stone Chatochitis[190]. They say that it attracts flesh,\r\nand keeps hold of the hands, just as a loadstone does iron, and amber\r\nchaff. But that happens only from a stickiness and from glue contained in\r\nit, since it sticks more easily to the hands when they are warm. Sagda or\r\nSagdo[191], of the colour of a sard, is a precious stone mentioned by\r\nPliny, Solinus, Albertus, and Evax[192]; they describe its nature and\r\nrelate, on the authority of others, that it specially attracts wood to\r\nitself. Some even babble that woods cannot be wrenched away except they are\r\ncut off. Some also narrate that a stone is found which grows pertinaciously\r\ninto ships, in the same way as certain testacea on long voyages. But a\r\nstone does not draw because it sticks; and if it drew, it would certainly\r\ndraw shreds electrically, Encelius saw in the hands of a sailor such a\r\nstone of feeble virtue, which would hardly attract even the smallest twigs;\r\nand in truth, not of the colour of the sard. So Diamond, Carbuncle,\r\nCrystal, and others do attract. I pass over other fabulous stones;\r\nPantarbe, about which Philostratus writes that it draws other stones to\r\nitself; Amphitane also, which attracts gold. Pliny in his origin of glass\r\nwill have it that a loadstone is an attractor of glass, as well as of iron.\r\nFor in his method of preparing glass, when he has indicated its nature, he\r\nsubjoins this about loadstone. \"Soon (such is the astute and resourceful\r\ncraft) it was not content to have mixed natron; loadstone also began to be\r\nadded, since it was thought to attract to itself the liquor of glass (as it\r\ndoes iron).\" Georgius Agricola writes that to the material of glass (sand\r\nand natron) one part also of loadstone is added. \"Because that force is\r\nbelieved, in our times just as in former times, to attract the liquor of\r\nglass to itself, as it attracts iron to itself, purges it when drawn, and\r\nmakes clear glass from green or muddy; but the fire afterwards burns up the\r\nloadstone.\" It is true indeed that some sort of _magnes_ (as the magnesia\r\nof the glass-makers imbued with no magnetick virtues) is sometimes put in\r\nand mixed with the material of the glass; not, however, because it attracts\r\nglass. But when a loadstone is burnt, it does not lay hold of iron at all,\r\nnor is iron when red-hot allured by any loadstone; and loadstone also is\r\nburnt up by more powerful fires and loses its attractive potency. Nor is\r\nthis a function of loadstone alone in the glass furnaces; but also of\r\ncertain pyrites and of some easily combustible iron ores, which are the\r\nonly ones used by our glass-makers, who make clear, bright glass. They are\r\nmixed with the sand, ashes, and natron (just as they are accustomed to make\r\nadditions in the case of metallick ores whilst they are smelted), so that\r\nwhen the material slows down into glass, the green and muddy colour of the\r\nglass may be purged by the penetrating heat. For no other material becomes\r\nso hot, {112} or bears the fire for such a convenient time, until the\r\nmaterial of the glass is perfectly fluid, and is at the same time burnt up\r\nby that ardent fire. It happens, however, sometimes, that on account of the\r\nmagnetick stone, the magnesia, or the ore, or the pyrites, the glass has a\r\ndusky colour, when they resist the fire too much and are not burnt up, or\r\nare put in in too great quantity. Wherefore manufacturers are seeking for a\r\nstone suitable for them, and are observing also more diligently the\r\nproportion of the mixture. Badly therefore did the unskilful philosophy of\r\nPliny impose upon Georgius Agricola and the more recent writers, so that\r\nthey thought the loadstone was wanted by glass-makers on account of its\r\nmagnetick strength and attraction. But Scaliger in _De Subtilitate ad\r\nCardanum_, in making diamond attract iron, when he is discussing\r\nmagneticks, wanders far from the truth, unless it be that diamond attracts\r\niron electrically, as it attracts wood, straws, and all other minute bodies\r\nwhen it is rubbed. Fallopius reckons that quicksilver draws metals by\r\nreason of an occult property, just as a loadstone iron, amber chaff. But\r\nwhen quicksilver enters metals, it is wrongly called attraction. For metals\r\nimbibe quicksilver, just as clay water; nor do they do this unless they are\r\ntouching, for quicksilver does not allure gold or lead to itself from afar,\r\nbut they remain motionless in their places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXXIX.\r\n\r\nOn Bodies which mutually repel one another.\r\n\r\nWriters who have discoursed on the forces of bodies which attract others\r\nhave also spoken about the powers of bodies which repel, but especially\r\nthose who have instituted classes for natural objects on the basis of\r\nsympathy and antipathy. Wherefore it would seem necessary for us to speak\r\nalso about the mutual strife of bodies, so that published errors should not\r\ncreep further, and be received by all to the ruin of true philosophy. They\r\nsay that, just as like things attract for the sake of preservation, so\r\nunlike and contrary things for the same purpose mutually repel and put one\r\nanother to flight. This is evident in the reaction of many things, but it\r\nis most manifest in the case of plants and animals, which attract kindred\r\nand familiar things, and in like manner reject foreign and unsuitable\r\nthings. But in other bodies there is not the same reason, so that when they\r\nare separated, they should come together by mutually {113} attracting one\r\nanother. Animals take food (as everything which grows), and draw it into\r\ntheir interior; they absorb the nourishment by certain parts and\r\ninstruments (through the action and operation of the _anima_). They enjoy\r\nby natural instinct only the things set in front of them and near them, not\r\nthings placed afar off; and this without any alien force or motion.\r\nWherefore animals neither attract any bodies nor drive them away. Water\r\ndoes not repel oil (as some think) because the oil floats on water; nor\r\ndoes water repel mud, because the mud, if mixed in water, settles down in\r\ntime. This is a separation of unlike bodies or such as are not perfectly\r\nmixed as respects the material; the separated bodies nevertheless remain\r\njoined without any natural strife. Wherefore a muddy sediment settles\r\nquietly on the bottom of vessels, and oil remains on the top of the water\r\nand is not sent further away. A drop of water remains intact on a dry\r\nsurface, and is not expelled from the dry substance. Wrongly therefore do\r\nthose who discourse on these matters infer an antipathy (that is, the force\r\nof repelling by contrary passions); for there is no repelling force in\r\nthem; and repulsion comes[193] from action, not from passion. But their\r\ngreek vocables please them too much. We, however, must inquire whether\r\nthere is any body which drives anything else further off without material\r\nimpetus, as a loadstone attracts. But a loadstone seems even to repel\r\nloadstone. For the pole of one loadstone repels the pole of another, which\r\ndoes not agree with it according to nature; by repelling, it turns it round\r\nin an orbit so that they may exactly agree according to their nature. But\r\nif a somewhat weak loadstone, floating freely on water, cannot readily be\r\nturned round on account of impediments, the whole loadstone is repelled and\r\nsent further away from the other. All electricks attract all things: they\r\nnever repel or propel anything at all[194]. As to what is related about\r\ncertain plants (as about the cucumber, which turns aside when oil is\r\napplied to it), there is a material change from the vicinity, not a hidden\r\nantipathy. But when they show a candle flame put against a cold solid\r\nsubstance (as iron) turn away to the side, and allege antipathy as the\r\ncause, they say nothing. The reason of this they will see clearer than the\r\nday, when we discourse on what heat is[195]. But Fracastorio's opinion that\r\na loadstone can be found, which would drive iron away, on account of some\r\nopposing principle lurking in the iron, is foolish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{115} [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBOOK THIRD.\r\n\r\n_CHAP. I._\r\n\r\nON DIRECTION.\r\n\r\nOn referring to the earlier books it will be found shown that a loadstone\r\nhas its poles, and that a piece of iron has also poles, and rotation, and a\r\ncertain verticity; finally, that the loadstone and the iron direct their\r\npoles toward the poles of the earth. Now, however, we must make clear the\r\ncauses of these things and their admirable workings, pointed out indeed\r\nbefore, but not proven. All those who have written before us about these\r\nrotations have left us their opinions so briefly, so meagrely, and with\r\nsuch hesitating judgment that they seem hardly likely ever to persuade\r\nanyone, or even to be able to satisfy themselves; and all their petty\r\nreasons are rejected by the more prudent as useless, uncertain, and absurd,\r\nbeing supported by no proofs or arguments; whence also magnetick science,\r\nbeing all the more neglected and not understood, has been in exile. The\r\ntrue austral pole of a loadstone, not the boreal (as all before us used to\r\nthink), * if the loadstone is placed in its boat on the surface of water,\r\nturns to the North; in the case of a piece of iron also, whether it has\r\nbeen excited by a loadstone or not, the southern end moves toward the\r\nNorth. An oblong piece of iron of three or four digits' length[196], when\r\nskilfully rubbed with a loadstone, quickly turns north and south. Wherefore\r\nmechanicians, taking a piece of iron prepared in this way, balance it on a\r\npin in a box, and fit it up with the requisites of a sun-dial; or they\r\nprepare the versorium out of two curved pieces of iron with their ends\r\ntouching one another, so that the motion may be more constant. In this way\r\nthe mariners' versorium is arranged, which is an instrument beneficial,\r\nuseful, and auspicious to sailors for indicating, like a good genius,\r\nsafety and the right way. But it must be understood on the threshold of\r\nthis argument (before we proceed further) that these pointings of the\r\nloadstone or of iron are not perpetually made {116} toward the true poles\r\nof the world, do not always seek those fixed and definite points, or remain\r\non the line of the true meridian; but usually diverge some distance to the\r\nEast or to the West. Sometimes also at certain places on land or sea they\r\ndo indicate exactly the true poles. This discrepancy is called the\r\n_Variation_ of the iron or of the loadstone; and since this is brought\r\nabout by other causes, and is merely a certain disturbance and perversion\r\nof the true direction, we are directing our attention in this place to the\r\ntrue direction of the compass and of the magnetick iron (which would be\r\nequally toward the true poles and on the true meridian everywhere on the\r\nearth, unless other obstacles and an untoward pervertency hindered it). Of\r\nits variation and the cause of the perversion we shall treat in the next\r\nbook. Those who wrote about the world and about natural philosophy a\r\ncentury ago, especially those remarkable elementary philosophers, and all\r\nthose who trace their knowledge and training to them down to our own times,\r\nthose men, I say, who represented the earth as always at rest and, as it\r\nwere, a useless weight, placed in the centre of the universe at an equal\r\ndistance from the sky on every side, and its nature to be simple, imbued\r\nonly with the qualities of dryness and cold, sought diligently for the\r\ncauses of all things and of all effects in the heavens, the stars, the\r\nplanets, in fire, air, waters and substances of mixed natures. Never indeed\r\ndid they recognize that the terrestrial globe had, besides dryness and\r\ncold, some special, effective, and predominant properties, strengthening,\r\ndirecting, and moving the globe itself through its whole mass and its very\r\ndeepest vitals; nor did they ever inquire whether there were any such. For\r\nthis reason the crowd of philosophizers, in order to discover the reasons\r\nof the magnetical motions, called up causes lying remote and far away. And\r\none man seems to me beyond all others worthy of censure, Martin Cortes,\r\nwho, since there was no cause which could satisfy him in the whole of\r\nnature, dreamed that there was a point of magnetical attraction beyond the\r\nheavens, which attracted iron. Peter Peregrinus thinks that the direction\r\narises from the poles of the sky. Cardan thought that the turning of iron\r\nwas caused by a star in the tail of the Great Bear; Bessard, the Frenchman,\r\nopines that a magnetick turns toward the pole of the zodiack. Marsilius\r\nFicinus will have it that the loadstone follows its own Arctick pole; but\r\nthat iron follows the loadstone, straws amber; whilst this perhaps follows\r\nthe Antarctick pole--a most foolish dream. Others have recourse to I know\r\nnot what magnetick rocks and mountains. Thus it is always customary with\r\nmortals, that they despise things near home, whilst foreign and distant\r\nthings are dear and prized. But we study the earth itself and observe in it\r\nthe cause of so great an effect. The earth, as the common mother, has these\r\ncauses inclosed in her innermost parts; in accordance with her rule, {117}\r\nposition, condition, verticity, poles, æquator, horizons, meridians,\r\ncentre, circumference, diameter, and the nature of the whole interior of\r\nher substance, must all magnetical motions be discussed. The earth has been\r\nordered by the highest Artificer and by nature in such a way that it should\r\nhave parts dissimilar in position, bounds of the whole and complete body,\r\nennobled by certain functions, by which it might itself remain in a\r\ndefinite direction. For just as a loadstone, when it is floated on water in\r\na suitable vessel, or is hung by slender threads in the air, by its\r\nimplanted verticity conforms its poles to the poles of the common mother in\r\naccordance with magnetick laws; so if the earth were to deviate from its\r\nnatural direction and its true position in the universe, or if its poles\r\nwere to be drawn aside (if this were possible) toward the sun-rising or the\r\nsun-setting or toward any other points whatsoever in the visible firmament,\r\nthey would return again to the north and south by magnetical motion, and\r\nwould settle at the same points at which they are now fixed. The reason why\r\nthe terrestrial globe seems to remain more steadily with the one pole\r\ntoward those parts and directed toward the Cynosure, and why its pole\r\ndiverges by 23 degrees 29 minutes, with a certain variation not\r\nsufficiently investigated as yet by Astronomers, from the poles of the\r\necliptick, depends on its virtue magnetical. The causes of the precession\r\nof the æquinoxes and the progression of the fixed stars, and of the change,\r\nmoreover, in the declinations of the sun and of the tropicks, must be\r\nsought from magnetick influences; so that neither that absurd motion of\r\ntrepidation of Thebit Bencora[197], which is at great variance with\r\nobservations, nor the monstrous superstructures of other heavens, are any\r\nlonger needed. A versatory iron turns to the position of the earth, and if\r\ndisturbed ever so often returns always to the same points. For in the far\r\nregions of the north, in a latitude of 70 or 80 degrees (to which at the\r\nmilder seasons of the year our sailors are accustomed to penetrate without\r\ninjury from the cold); in the regions halfway between the poles; on the\r\næquator in the torrid zone; and again in all the maritime places and lands\r\nof the south, in the highest latitude which has thus far been reached,\r\nalways the iron magnetick finds its way, and points to the poles in the\r\nsame manner (excepting for the difference of variation); on this side of\r\nthe æquator (where we live), and on the other side to the south, less well\r\nknown, but yet in some measure explored by sailors: and always the lily of\r\nthe compass points toward the North. This we have had confirmed by the most\r\neminent captains, and also by very many of the more intelligent sailors.\r\nThese facts have been pointed out to me and confirmed by our most\r\nillustrious Sea-god, Francis Drake, and by another circumnavigator of the\r\nglobe, Thomas Candish; our terrella also indicates the same thing. This is\r\ndemonstrated in the case of the {118} [Illustration] orbicular stone, whose\r\npoles are A and B; an iron wire CD, which is placed upon the stone, always\r\npoints directly along the meridian toward the poles AB, whether the centre\r\nof the wire is on the central line or æquator of the stone, or on any other\r\npart situated between the æquator and the poles, as at H, G, F, E. So the\r\ncusp of a versorium on this side of the æquator points toward the north; *\r\non the other side the cross is always directed toward the south; but the\r\ncusp or lily[198] does not, as some one has thought, turn toward the south\r\nbeyond the æquator. Some inexperienced people indeed, who in distant parts\r\nbeyond the æquator have seen the versorium sometimes become more sluggish\r\nand less prompt, thought that the distance from the arctick pole or from\r\nthe magnetick rocks was the cause of this. But they are very much mistaken;\r\nfor it is as powerful[199], and adjusts itself as quickly to the meridian\r\nor to the point of variation in the southern as in the northern parts of\r\nthe earth. Yet sometimes the motion appears slower, namely, when the\r\nsupporting pin by lapse of time and long voyaging has become somewhat\r\nblunt, or the magnetick iron parts have lost, by age or rust, some of their\r\nacquired vigour. This may also be shown experimentally by the versatory\r\niron of a small sun-dial placed on a very short pin set perpendicular to\r\nthe surface of the stone, for the iron when touched by a loadstone points\r\ntoward the poles of the stone and leaves the poles of the earth; for the\r\ngeneral and remoter cause is overcome by the particular and powerful cause\r\nwhich is so near at hand. Magnetick bodies have of themselves an\r\ninclination toward the position of the earth and are influenced by a\r\nterrella. Two equal stones of equal strength adjust themselves to a\r\nterrella in accordance with magnetick laws. The iron conceives vigour from\r\nthe loadstone and is influenced by the magnetical motions. Wherefore true\r\ndirection is the motion of a magnetick body in regard to the verticity of\r\nthe earth, the natures of both agreeing and working together toward a\r\nnatural position and unity. For indeed we have found out at length, by many\r\nexperiments and in many ways, that there is a disposing nature, moving them\r\ntogether by reason of their various positions by one form that is common\r\n{119} to both, and that in all magnetick substances there is attraction and\r\nrepulsion. For both the stone[200] and the magnetick iron arrange\r\nthemselves by inclination and declination, according to the common position\r\nof their nature and the earth. And the force of the earth by the virtue of\r\nthe whole, by attracting toward the poles, and repelling, arranges all\r\nmagneticks which are unfixed and loose. For in all cases all magneticks\r\nconform themselves to the globe of the earth in the same ways and by the\r\nsame laws by which another loadstone or any magneticks do to a\r\nterrella.[201]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nThe Directive or Versorial Virtue (which we call\r\nverticity): what it is, how it exists in the loadstone;\r\n_and in what way it is acquired when innate._\r\n\r\nDirective force, which is also called by us verticity, is a virtue which\r\nspreads by an innate vigour from the æquator in both directions toward the\r\npoles. That power, inclining in both directions towards the termini, causes\r\nthe motion of direction, and produces a constant and permanent position in\r\nNature, not only in the earth itself but also in all magneticks. Loadstone\r\nis found either in veins of its own or in iron mines, when the homogeneous\r\nsubstance of the earth, either having or assuming a primary form, is\r\nchanged or concreted into a stony substance, which besides the primary\r\nqualities of its nature has various dissimilitudes and differences in\r\ndifferent quarries and mines, as if from different matrices, and very many\r\nsecondary qualities and varieties in its substance. A loadstone which is\r\ndug out in this breaking up of the earth's surface and of protuberances\r\nupon it, whether formed complete in itself (as sometimes in China) or in a\r\nlarger vein, is fashioned by the earth and follows the nature of the whole.\r\nAll the interior parts of the earth mutually conspire together in\r\ncombination and produce direction toward north and south. But those\r\nmagnetical bodies which come together in the uppermost parts of the earth\r\nare not true united parts of the whole, but appendages and parts joined on,\r\nimitating the nature of the whole; wherefore when floating free on water,\r\nthey dispose themselves just in the same way as they are placed in the\r\nterrestrial system of nature. We had a large loadstone of twenty pounds *\r\nweight, dug up and cut out of its vein, after we had first observed and\r\nmarked its ends; then after it was dug out, we placed it in a boat on\r\nwater, so that it could turn freely; then immediately the face which had\r\nlooked toward the north in the quarry began to {120} turn to the north on\r\nthe waves and at length settled toward that point. For that face which\r\nlooked toward the north in the quarry is the southern, and is attracted by\r\nthe northern parts of the earth, [Illustration] in the same way as pieces\r\nof iron which acquire their verticity from the earth. About this point we\r\nintend to speak afterwards[202] under change of verticity. But there is a\r\ndifferent rotation of the internal parts of the earth, which are perfectly\r\nunited to the earth and which are not separated from the true substance of\r\nthe earth by the interposition of bodies as are loadstones in the upper\r\nportion of the earth, which is maimed, corrupt, and variable. Let A B be a\r\npiece of magnetick ore; between which and the uniform globe of the earth\r\nlie various soils or mixtures which separate the ore to a certain extent\r\nfrom the globe of the true earth. It is therefore influenced by the forces\r\nof the earth just in the same way as C D, a piece of iron, in the air. So\r\nthe face B of some ore or of that piece of it is moved toward the Boreal\r\npole G, just as the extremity C of the iron, not A or D. But the condition\r\nof the piece E F is different, which piece is produced in one connected\r\nmass with the whole, and is not separated from it by any earthy mixture.\r\nFor if the part E F were taken out and floated freely in a boat by itself,\r\nit is not E that would be directed toward the Boreal pole, but F. So in\r\nthose substances which acquire their verticity in the air, C is the\r\nsouthern part and is seen to be attracted by the Boreal pole G. In the case\r\nof others which are found in the upper unstable portion of the earth, B is\r\nthe south, and in like manner inclines toward the Boreal pole. But if those\r\npieces deep down which are produced along with the earth are dug up, they\r\nturn about on a different plan. For F turns toward the Boreal parts of the\r\nearth, because * is the southern part; E toward the south, because it is\r\nthe northern. So of a magnetick body, C D, placed close to the earth, the\r\nend C turns toward the Boreal pole; of one that is adnate to it B A, B\r\ninclines to the North; of one that is innate in it, E F, E turns toward the\r\nsouthern pole; which is confirmed by the {121} [Illustration] following\r\ndemonstration, and comes about of necessity according to all magnetick\r\nlaws. Let there be a terrella with poles A B; from its mass cut out a small\r\npart E F; if this be suspended by a fine thread above the hole or over some\r\nother place, E does not seek the pole A but the pole B, and F turns to A;\r\nvery differently from a rod of iron C D; because C, touching some northern\r\npart of the terrella, being magnetically carried away makes a turn round to\r\nA, not to B. And yet here it should be observed, that if the pole A of *\r\nthe terrella were moved toward the earth's south, the end E of the piece\r\ncut out by itself, if not brought too near to the stone, would also move of\r\nitself toward the south. But the end C of the piece of iron, placed beyond\r\nits orbe of virtue, will turn toward the north. The part E F of the\r\nterrella, whilst in the mass, produced the same direction as the whole; but\r\nwhen it is separated and suspended by a thread, E turns to B, and F to A.\r\n[Illustration] {122} So parts having the same verticity with the whole,\r\nwhen separated, are impelled in the contrary direction; for contrary parts\r\nsolicit contrary parts. Nor yet is this a true contrariety, but the highest\r\nconcordancy, and the true and genuine conformation of bodies magnetical in\r\nthe system of nature, if they shall have been divided and separated: for\r\nthe parts thus divided should be raised some distance from the whole, as\r\nwill be made clear afterwards. Magnetick substances seek a unity as regards\r\nform; they do not so much respect their own mass. Wherefore the part F E is\r\nnot attracted into its former bed; but when once it is unsettled and at a\r\ndistance, it is * solicited by the opposite pole. But if the small piece F\r\nE is placed back again in its bed or brought close to, without any\r\nsubstances intervening, it acquires its former combination, and, as a part\r\nof the whole once more united, accords with the whole and sticks readily in\r\nits former position; and E remains toward A, and F toward B, and they\r\nsettle steadily in their mother's lap. The reasoning is the same when the\r\nstone is divided into equal parts through the poles. [Illustration] A\r\nspherical stone is divided into two equal parts along the axis A B; *\r\nwhether therefore the surface A B is in the one part facing upward (as in\r\nthe former diagram) or lying on its face in both parts (as in * the\r\nlatter), the end A tends toward B. But it must also be understood that the\r\npoint A is not carried with a definite aim always toward the point B,\r\nbecause in consequence of the division the verticity proceeds to other\r\npoints, as to F G, as appears in the fourteenth chapter of this book. And L\r\nM are now the axes in each, and A B is no longer the axis; for magnetick\r\nbodies, as soon as they are divided, become single magnetick wholes; and\r\nthey have {123} vertices in accordance with their mass, new poles arising\r\nat each end in consequence of the division. Yet the axis and the poles\r\nalways follow the leading of a meridian; because that force passes along\r\nthe meridians of the stone from the æquator to the poles, by an everlasting\r\nrule, the inborn virtue of the substance agreeing thereto from the long and\r\nlasting position and the facing of a suitable substance toward the poles of\r\nthe earth; by whose strength continued through many centuries it has been\r\nfashioned; toward fixed and determined parts of which it has remained since\r\nits origin firmly and constantly turned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nHow Iron acquires Verticity through\r\na Loadstone, and how that verticity\r\n_is lost and changed_.\r\n\r\nFriction between an oblong piece of iron and a loadstone imparts to the\r\nformer magnetick virtues, which are not corporeal nor inherent and\r\npersistent in any body, as we showed in the discussion on coition. It is\r\nplain that the iron, when it has been rubbed hard with one end and applied\r\nto the stone for a pretty long time, receives no stony nature, acquires no\r\nweight; for if, before the iron is touched by the stone, you weigh * it in\r\na small and very exact goldsmith's balance, you will see after the rubbing\r\nthat it has exactly the same weight, neither diminished nor increased. But\r\nif you wipe the iron with cloths after it has been touched, or wash it in\r\nwater, or scour it with sand or on a grindstone, still it in nowise lays\r\naside its acquired strength. For the force is spread through the whole body\r\nand conceived in the inmost parts, and cannot in any way be washed or wiped\r\naway. Let an experiment then be made in fire, that untamed tyrant of\r\nnature. Take a piece of iron of the length of a palm and the thickness of a\r\ngoosequill pen; let this iron be passed through a suitable round cork and\r\nplaced on the surface of water, and observe the end which turns to the\r\nnorth; rub this particular end with the true southern end of a loadstone;\r\nthe iron so rubbed turns toward the south. Remove the cork, and place the\r\nend * which was excited in the fire until the iron is just red-hot; when it\r\nis cooled, it will retain the strength of the loadstone and the verticity,\r\nthough it will not be so prompt, whether because the force of the fire had\r\nnot yet continued long enough to overcome all its {124} strength, or\r\nbecause the whole iron was not heated to redness, for the virtue is\r\ndiffused through the whole. Remove the cork a second time, and putting the\r\nwhole iron in the fire, blow the fire with the bellows, so that it may be\r\nall aglow, and let it remain a little longer time red-hot; when cooled (so,\r\nhowever, that, whilst it is cooling, it does not rest in one position),\r\nplace it again on the water with the cork, and you will see that it has\r\nlost the verticity * which it had acquired from the stone. From these\r\nexperiments it is clear how difficult it is for the property of polarity\r\nimplanted by the loadstone to be destroyed. But if a small loadstone had\r\nremained as long in the same fire, it would have lost its strength. Iron,\r\nbecause it does not so easily perish, and is not so easily burnt up as very\r\nmany loadstones, retains its strength more stably, and when it is lost can\r\nrecover it again from a loadstone; but a loadstone when burnt does not\r\nrevive. But now that iron, which has * been deprived of its magnetick form,\r\nmoves in a different way from any other piece of iron, for it has lost its\r\npolar nature; and whereas before the touch of the loadstone it may have had\r\na motion toward the north, and after contact toward the south; now it turns\r\nto no definite and particular point; but afterwards, very slowly and after\r\n* a long time, it begins to turn in a doubtful fashion toward the poles of\r\nthe earth (having acquired some power from the earth). I have said that the\r\ncause of direction was twofold, one implanted in the stone and iron, but\r\nthe other in the earth, implanted by the disponent virtue; and for that\r\nreason (the distinction of poles and the verticity in the iron having now\r\nbeen destroyed) a slow and weak directive power is acquired anew from the\r\nverticity of the earth. We may see, therefore, with what difficulty and\r\nonly by the application of hot fires and by long ignition of the iron\r\nheated to softness, the imparted magnetick virtue is eradicated. When this\r\nignition has overcome the acquired polarity, and it has been now completely\r\nsubdued and not awakened again, that iron is left unsettled and utterly\r\nincapable of direction. But we must further inquire how iron remains\r\naffected by verticity. It is manifest that it strongly affects and changes\r\nthe nature of the iron, because the presence of a loadstone attracts the\r\niron to itself with an altogether wonderful readiness. Nor is it only the\r\npart that is rubbed, but on account of the rubbing (on one end only) the\r\nwhole iron is affected together, and gains by it a permanent though an\r\nunequal power. This is demonstrated as follows. Rub an iron wire on the end\r\nso * that it is excited, and it will turn towards the north; afterward cut\r\noff some portion of it; you will see that it still turns toward the north\r\n(as before), but more feebly. For it must be understood that the loadstone\r\nexcites a steady verticity in the whole iron (if the rod be not too long)\r\nmore vigorous throughout the whole mass in a shorter bar, and as long as\r\nthe iron remains touching the loadstone a little {125} stronger. But when\r\nthe iron is separated from contact with it, then it becomes much weaker,\r\nespecially in the end that was not touched. Just as a long rod, one end of\r\nwhich is placed in the fire and heated, grows exceedingly hot at that end,\r\nless so in the parts adjoining and in the middle, whilst at the other end\r\nit can be held in the hand, and that end is only warm; so the magnetical\r\nvigour diminishes from the excited end to the other end; but it is present\r\nthere instantly, and does not enter after an interval of time nor\r\nsuccessively, as the heat in the iron; for as soon as a piece of iron has\r\nbeen touched by a loadstone it is excited throughout its whole length. For\r\nthe sake of experiment, let there be a rod of iron 4 or * 5 digits long,\r\nuntouched by a loadstone; as soon as you touch one end only with a\r\nloadstone, the opposite end immediately, or in the twinkling of an eye, by\r\nthe power that it has conceived, repels or attracts a versorium, if it be\r\napplied to it ever so quickly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\nWhy Iron touched by a Loadstone acquires an opposite\r\n_verticity, and why iron touched by the true Northern side of a stone_\r\nturns to the North of the earth, by the true Southern side\r\n_to the South; and does not turn to the South when rubbed\r\nby the Northern point of the stone, and when by\r\nthe Southern to the North, as all who have\r\nwritten on the loadstone have\r\nfalsely supposed._\r\n\r\nDemonstration has already been given that the northern part of a loadstone\r\ndoes not attract the northern part of another stone, but the southern, and\r\nrepels the northern part of another stone from its northern side when it is\r\napplied[203] to it. That general magnet, the terrestrial globe, disposes\r\niron touched by a loadstone in the same way, and likewise magnetick iron\r\nstirs this same iron by its implanted strength, and excites motion and\r\ncontrols it. For whether the comparison and experiment has been made\r\nbetween loadstone and loadstone, or loadstone and iron, or iron and iron,\r\nor the earth and loadstone, or the earth and iron conformed * by the earth\r\nor strengthened by the power of a loadstone, the strength and inclinations\r\nof each must mutually harmonize and accord in the same way. But the reason\r\nmust be sought, why a piece of iron when touched by a loadstone acquires a\r\ndisposition to motion toward the opposite pole of the earth, and not toward\r\nthat {126} pole of the earth to which that pole of that loadstone turned by\r\nwhich it was excited. It has been pointed out that iron and loadstone are\r\nof one primary nature; when the iron is joined to the loadstone, they\r\nbecome, as it were, one body, and not only is the end of the iron changed,\r\nbut the remaining parts also are affected along with it. A, the north pole\r\nof a loadstone, is placed against the cusp of a piece of iron; the cusp of\r\nthe iron has now become the southern part of the iron, [Illustration]\r\nbecause it is touching the northern part of the stone; the cross-end of the\r\niron has become the northern. For if that contiguous magnetick substance be\r\nseparated from the pole of the terrella, or from the parts near the pole,\r\nthe one end (or the end which, whilst the connection was kept up, was\r\ntouching the northern part of the stone) is the southern, whilst the other\r\nis the northern. So also if a versorium excited by a loadstone be divided\r\ninto ever so many parts (however small), those parts when separated will,\r\nit is clear, arrange themselves in the same disposition as that in which\r\nthey were disposed before, when they were undivided. Wherefore whilst the\r\ncusp remains over the northern pole A, it is not the southern end, but is,\r\nas it were, part of a whole; but when it is taken away from the stone, it\r\nis the southern end, because when rubbed it tended toward the northern\r\nparts of the stone, and the cross (the other end of the versorium) is the\r\nnorthern end. The loadstone and the iron make one body; B is the south pole\r\nof the whole; C (that is, the cross) is the northern end of the whole;\r\ndivide the iron also at E, and E will be the southern end with respect to\r\nthe cross; and E will likewise be the northern end in respect to B. A is\r\nthe true northern pole of the stone and is attracted by the southern pole\r\nof the earth. The end of the iron which is touched by the true boreal part\r\nof the stone becomes the southern end, and turns to A, the north [pole] of\r\nthe stone, if it be near; or if it be some distance from the stone it turns\r\nto the north [pole] of the earth. So always iron which is touched (if it is\r\nfree and unrestrained) tends to the opposite part of the earth from that\r\npart to which the loadstone that touched it tends. Nor does it * make any\r\ndifference how it is rubbed, whether straight up or slanting in some way.\r\nFor in any case the verticity flows into the iron, {127} [Illustration]\r\nprovided it is touched by either end. Wherefore all the cusps at B acquire\r\nthe same verticity, after they are separated, but opposite to that pole of\r\nthe stone; wherefore also they are united to the loadstone at the pole B;\r\nand all the crosses in the present figure have the opposite verticity to\r\nthe pole E, and are moved and laid hold of by E when they are in a\r\nconvenient position. It is exactly the same in the case of the long stone F\r\nH divided at G; F and H always move, both in the whole and in the divided\r\nstone, to opposite poles of the earth, and O and P mutually attract one\r\nanother, the one of them being the northern, the other the southern. For,\r\nsupposing H to have been the southern in the whole stone and F the\r\nnorthern, P will be the northern with respect to H in the divided stone,\r\nand O the southern with respect to F. So also F and H mutually incline to a\r\nconnection, if they are turned a very little toward one another, and run\r\ntogether at length and join. But supposing the division of the stone to\r\nhave been meridional (that is, according to the line of a meridian, not of\r\nany parallel circle), then they turn [Illustration] round, and A attracts\r\nB, and the end B is attracted to A and attracts A, until, being turned\r\nround, they are connected and cemented together; because magnetick\r\nattraction is not made along the parallels, but meridionally. For this\r\nreason pieces of iron placed on a terrella whose poles are A B, near the\r\næquator along parallels, * do not combine or stick together firmly: {128}\r\n[Illustration] But if applied to one another along a meridian they are\r\nimmediately * joined firmly together, not only on and near the stone, but\r\neven at some distance within the force of the controlling orbe. Thus they\r\nare joined and cemented together at E, but not at C in the other figure.\r\nFor the opposite ends C and F meet and adhære together in the case of the\r\niron just in the same way as A and B before in the case of the stone. But\r\nthey are opposite ends, because the pieces of iron proceed from the\r\nopposite sides and poles of the terrella; and C in reference to the\r\nnorthern pole A is southern, and F is boreal in reference to the * southern\r\npole B. In like manner also they are cemented together, if the rod C (being\r\nnot too long[204]) be moved further toward A, and F toward B, and they be\r\njoined together over the terrella, like A and B of the divided stone above.\r\nBut now if the cusp A, * which has been touched by a loadstone, be the\r\nsouthern end, and you were to touch and rub with this the cusp of another\r\niron needle B, which has not been touched, B will be northern, and will\r\npoint to the south. But if you were to touch with the northern point B any\r\nother iron needle, still new, on its cusp, this again will be southern, and\r\nwill turn to the north. The iron not only receives the necessary strength\r\nfrom the loadstone, if it be a good loadstone, but also imparts its\r\nacquired strength to another piece of iron, and the second to a third\r\n(always in strict accordance with magnetick laws). In all these\r\ndemonstrations of ours it should always be borne in mind that the poles of\r\na stone, as well as those of iron, whether touched or untouched, are always\r\nin fact and by nature opposite to the pole toward which they point and are\r\nso designated by us, as we have laid down above. For in them all it is\r\nalways the northern * which tends to the south, either of the earth or of\r\nthe stone, and the southern which tends to the north of the stone. Northern\r\nparts are attracted by the southern of the earth; so in the boat they {129}\r\ntend toward the south. A piece of iron touched by the northern parts of a\r\nloadstone becomes south at the one end and tends always (if it is near and\r\nwithin the orbe of the loadstone) to the north of the stone, and if it be\r\nfree and left to itself at some distance from the stone, it tends to the\r\nnorthern part of the earth. The northern pole A of a loadstone turns to G,\r\nthe south of the earth; a versorium touched at its cusp by the part A\r\nfollows A, because it has become southern. But the versorium C, placed\r\nfarther away from the loadstone, turns its cusp to F, the north of the\r\nearth, because * the cusp has become southern by contact with the boreal\r\npart of the stone. So the ends touched by the northern part of the stone\r\nare made southern, or are excited with a southern polarity, and tend toward\r\nthe north of the earth; those touched by the southern pole are made\r\nnorthern, or are excited with a northern force, and turn to the south of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nOn the Touching of pieces of Iron\r\n_of divers shapes._\r\n\r\nBars of iron, when touched by a loadstone, have one end north, the other\r\nsouth, and in the middle is the limit of verticity, like the æquinoctial\r\ncircle on the globe of a terrella or on an iron globe. But when an iron\r\nring is rubbed on one side on a * loadstone, then the one pole is on the\r\nplace that was in contact, whilst the other is at the opposite point; and\r\nthe magnetick power divides the ring into two parts by a natural\r\ndistinction which, though not in shape, yet in power and effect is like an\r\næquator. But if a thin straight rod be bent into a ring without any welding\r\nor union of the ends, and be touched in the middle by a loadstone, both\r\nends will be of the same verticity. Let a ring be taken which is whole and\r\ncontinuous, and which has been * touched by a loadstone at one place, and\r\nlet it be divided afterward {130} at the opposite point and straightened\r\nout, both ends will also be * of the same verticity, no otherwise than a\r\nthin rod touched in the middle or a ring not cohærent at the joint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nWhat seems an Opposing Motion in Magneticks\r\n_is a proper motion toward unity_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn things magnetical nature always tends to unity, not merely to confluence\r\nand agglomeration, but to harmony; in such a way that the rotational and\r\ndisponent faculty should not be disturbed, as is variously shown in the\r\nfollowing example. Let C D be an entire body of some magnetick substance,\r\nin which C tends to B, the north of the earth, and D to the south, A.\r\nThen[205] divide it in the middle in its æquator, and it will be E that is\r\ntending toward A, and F tending toward B. For just as in the undivided\r\nbody, so in the divided, nature aims at these bodies being united; the end\r\nE again joins with F harmoniously and * eagerly and they stick together,\r\nbut E is never joined to D, nor F to C; for then C must be turned contrary\r\nto nature toward A, the south, or D toward B, the north, which is foreign\r\nto them and incongruous. Separate the stone in the place where it is cut\r\nand turn D round to C; they harmonize and combine excellently. For D is\r\ntending to the south, as before, and C to the north; E and F, parts which\r\nwere cognate in the ore, are now widely separated, for they do not move\r\ntogether on account of material affinity, but they take their motion and\r\ninclination from their form. So the ends, whether joined or divided, tend\r\nmagnetically in the same way to the earth's poles in the first figure where\r\nthere is one whole, or divided as in the second figure; and F E in the\r\nsecond figure is a perfect magnetick joined together into one body and C D,\r\njust as it was primarily produced in its ore, and F E in its boat, turn in\r\n{131} this way to the poles of the earth and are conformed to them. * This\r\nharmony of the magnetick form is shown also in the forms of vegetables. Let\r\nA B be a twig from a branch of osier or other * tree which sprouts easily.\r\nLet A be the upper part, B the lower part toward the root; divide it at C\r\nD; I say that the end D, if grafted again to C by the primer's art, grows\r\nto it; just as also if B is grafted to A, they grow together and germinate.\r\nBut D being grafted on A, or C on B, they are at variance, and never grow\r\ninto one another, but one of them dies on account of the inverted and\r\ninharmonious arrangement, since the vegetative force, which moves in one\r\nway, is now impelled in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Also\r\njust as a terrella attracts magnetick bodies variously with dissimilar\r\nforces, so also an iron snout placed on the stone obtains a different\r\npotency in proportion to the latitude, * just as a snout at L by its firmer\r\nconnection resists a greater weight more stoutly than one at M, and at M\r\nthan at N. But neither does the snout raise the spike to the perpendicular\r\nexcept at the poles, as is shown in the figure. A snout at L may hold and\r\nlift from the earth two ounces of iron in one piece; yet it is not strong\r\nenough to raise an iron wire of two grains weight to the perpendicular,\r\nwhich would happen if the verticity arose on account of a * stronger\r\nattraction, or rather coition or unition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOf Discords between pieces of Iron upon the same pole\r\nof a loadstone, and how they can agree and\r\n_stand joined together_.\r\n\r\nSuppose two iron wires or a pair of needles stuck on the pole of a\r\nterrella; though they ought to stand perpendicularly, they mutually repel\r\none another at the upper * end, and produce the appearance of a fork; and\r\nif one end be forcibly impelled toward the other, the other declines and\r\nbends away from association with it, as in the following figure.\r\n[Illustration] {133} A and B, iron spikes, adhære obliquely[207] upon the\r\npole on account of their nearness to one another; either alone would\r\notherwise stand erect and perpendicular. For the extremities A B, being of\r\nthe same verticity, mutually abhor and fly one another. For if C be the\r\nnorthern pole of the terrella, A and B are also northern ends; but the ends\r\nwhich are joined to and held at the pole C are both * southern. But if\r\nthose spikes be a little longer (as, for example, of two digits length) and\r\nbe joined by force, they adhære together and unite in a friendly style, and\r\nare not separated without force. For they are magnetically welded, and\r\nthere are now no longer two distinct ends, but one end and one body; no\r\nless than a wire which is doubled and set up perpendicularly. But here is\r\nseen also another subtile point, that if those spikes were shorter, not as\r\nmuch as the * breadth of one digit, or even the length of a barleycorn,\r\nthey are in no way willing to harmonize or to stand straight up at the same\r\ntime, because naturally in shorter wires the verticity is stronger in the\r\nends which are distant from the terrella and the magnetick discord more\r\nvehement than in long ones. Wherefore they in no way admit of an intimate\r\nassociation and connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLikewise if those lighter pieces of iron or iron wires be suspended,\r\nhanging, as A and B, from a very fine silk thread, not twisted * but\r\nbraided, distant from the stone the length of a single barleycorn, then the\r\nopposing ends, A and B, being situated within the orbe of virtue above the\r\npole, keep a little away from one another for the same reason; except when\r\nthey are very near the pole of the stone C, the stone then attracting them\r\nmore strongly toward one end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{134} CHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nFigures illustrating direction and showing varieties\r\n_of rotations_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPassing from the probable cause of motion toward fixed points (according to\r\nmagnetick laws and principles), it remains for us to indicate those\r\nmotions. Above a round loadstone (whose poles are A, B) let a versatory\r\nneedle be placed whose cusp has been excited by the pole A; that cusp is\r\ncertainly directed toward A, and is strongly attracted by A; because,\r\nhaving been touched by A, it is in true harmony with A, and combines with\r\nit; and yet it is called contrary, because when the versorium is separated\r\nfrom the stone, it is seen to be moved toward the opposite part of the\r\nearth to that toward which the pole A of the loadstone is moved. For if A\r\nbe the northern pole of the terrella, the cusp is the southern end of the\r\nneedle, of which the other end (namely, the cross) is pointed to B; so B is\r\nthe southern pole of the loadstone, but the cross is the northern end of\r\nthe versorium. So also the cusp is attracted by E, F, G, H, and by every *\r\npart of a meridian, from the æquator toward the pole, by the faculty\r\ndisponent; and when the versorium is on the same parts of the meridian, the\r\ncusp is directed toward A. For it is not the point A that turns the\r\nversorium toward it, but the whole loadstone; as also the whole earth does,\r\nin the turning of loadstones to the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Figures illustrating magnetick directions in a right sphere[208] of stone,\r\nand in the right sphere of the earth, as well as the polar directions to\r\nthe perpendicular of the poles._ All these cusps have been touched by the\r\npole A; all the cusps are turned toward A, excepting that one which is\r\nrepelled by B.\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\n[Illustration] _Figures illustrating horizontal directions above the body\r\nof a loadstone._ All the cusps that have been made southern by rubbing on\r\nthe boreal pole, or some place round the northern pole A, turn toward the\r\npole A, and turn away from the southern pole B, toward which all the\r\ncrosses look. I call the direction horizontal, because it is arranged along\r\nthe plane of the horizon; for nautical and * horological instruments are so\r\nconstructed that the iron hangs or is supported in æquilibrium on the point\r\nof a sharp pin, which prevents the dipping of the versorium, about which we\r\nintend to speak later. And in this way it is of the greatest use to man,\r\nindicating and distinguishing all the points of the horizon and the winds.\r\nOtherwise on every oblique sphere (whether of stone or the earth) versoria\r\nand all magnetick substances would have a dip by their own nature below the\r\nhorizon; and at the poles the directions would be perpendicular, which\r\nappears in our discussion _On Declination_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_A round stone (or terrella) cut in two at the æquator;_ and all the cusps\r\nhave been touched by the pole A. The points at the centre of the earth, and\r\nbetween the two parts of the terrella which has been cut in two through the\r\nplane of the æquator, {136} are directed as in the present[209] diagram.\r\nThis would also happen in the same way if the division of the stone were\r\nthrough the plane of a tropick, and the mutual separation of the divided\r\nparts and the interval between them were the same as before, when the\r\nloadstone was divided through the plane of the æquator, and the parts\r\nseparated. For the cusps are repelled by C, are attracted by D; and the\r\nversoria are parallel, the poles or the verticity in both ends mutually\r\nrequiring it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Half a terrella by itself and its directions, unlike the directions * of\r\nthe two parts close to one another as shown in the figure above_. All the\r\ncusps have been touched by A; all the crosses below except the middle one\r\ntend toward the loadstone, not straight, but obliquely; because the pole is\r\nin the middle of the plane which before was the plane of the æquator. All\r\ncusps touched by places distant from the pole move toward the pole (exactly\r\nthe same as if they had been rubbed upon the pole itself), not toward the\r\nplace where they were rubbed, wherever that may have been in the undivided\r\nstone in some latitude between the pole and the æquator. And for this\r\nreason there are only two distinctions of regions, northern and southern,\r\nin the terrella, just {137} as in the general terrestrial globe, and there\r\nis no eastern nor western place; nor are there any eastern or western\r\nregions, rightly speaking; but they are names used in respect of one\r\nanother toward the eastern or western part of the sky. Wherefore it does\r\nnot appear that Ptolemy did rightly in his _Quadripartitum_, making eastern\r\nand western districts and provinces, with which he improperly connects the\r\nplanets, whom the common crowd of philosophizers and the superstitious\r\nsoothsayers follow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOn Mutation of Verticity and of Magnetick\r\nProperties, or on alteration in the power\r\n_excited by a loadstone_.\r\n\r\nFriction with a loadstone gives to a piece of iron a verticity strong\r\nenough; not, however, so stable that the iron may not by being rubbed on\r\nthe opposite part (not only with a more powerful loadstone, but with the\r\nsame) be changed and deprived of all its former verticity, and indued with\r\na new and opposite one. Take a piece of iron wire and rub each end of the\r\nwire equally with one and the same pole of a loadstone, and let it be\r\npassed through a suitable cork and place it on water. Then truly one end of\r\nthe wire will be directed toward that pole of the earth toward which that\r\nend of the stone will not turn. But which end of the iron wire will it be?\r\nThat certainly which was rubbed last. Rub the other end of this again with\r\nthe same pole, and immediately * that end will turn itself in the opposite\r\ndirection. Again touch the former end of the iron wire only with the same\r\npole of the loadstone as before; and that[210] end, having gained the\r\ncommand, immediately changes to the contrary side. So you will be able to\r\nchange the property of the iron frequently, and that end of the wire rules\r\nwhich has been touched the last. Now then merely hold the boreal pole of\r\nthe stone for some time near the boreal part of the wire which was last\r\ntouched, so that it does not touch, but so that it is removed from it by\r\none, two, or even three digits, if the stone have been pretty * strong; and\r\nagain it will change its property and will turn round to the contrary side;\r\nwhich will also happen (albeit rather more feebly) even if the loadstone be\r\nremoved to a distance of four digits. You will be able to do the same\r\nthing, moreover, with both the austral and the boreal part of the stone in\r\nall these experiments. Verticity may likewise be acquired and changed when\r\nthin plates of gold, * silver, and glass are interposed between the stone\r\nand the end of the iron or iron wire, if the stone were rather strong, even\r\nif the {138} intermediate lamina is not touched either by the iron or the\r\nstone. And these changes of verticity take place in smelted iron. Indeed\r\nwhat the one pole of the stone implants and excites, the other disturbs and\r\nextinguishes, and confers a new force. For it does not require a stronger\r\nloadstone to take away the weaker and sluggish virtue and to implant the\r\nnew one; nor is iron inebriated by the equal strength of loadstones, and\r\nmade utterly uncertain and neutral, as Baptista Porta teaches; but by one\r\nand the same loadstone, or by loadstones endowed with equal power and\r\nmight, its strength is, in accordance with magnetick rules, turned round\r\nand changed, excited, repaired, or disturbed. But a loadstone itself, by\r\nbeing rubbed on another, whether a larger or a more powerful stone, is not\r\ndisturbed from its own property and verticity, nor does it turn round\r\ntoward the opposite direction in its boat, or to the other pole opposite to\r\nthat to which it inclines by its own nature and implanted verticity. For\r\nstrength which is innate and has been implanted for a very long time abides\r\nmore firmly, nor does it easily yield from its ancient holding; and that\r\nwhich has grown for a long time is not all of a sudden brought to nothing,\r\nwithout the destruction of the substance containing it. Nevertheless in a\r\nlong interval of time a change * does take place; in one year, that is to\r\nsay, or two, or sometimes in a few months; doubtless when a weaker\r\nloadstone remains lying by a stronger one contrary to the order of nature,\r\nnamely, with the northern pole of one loadstone adjoined to the northern\r\npole of another, or the southern to the southern. For so the weaker\r\nstrength gradually declines with the lapse of time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

If, however, it float by chance\r\ntoward the poles, it will be checked a little by the poles of the earth,\r\nand will at length by the influence of the earth be indued with verticity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{139} CHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nIn what way Verticity exists in any Iron that has\r\n_been smelted though not excited by a lodestone_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHaving thus far[211] demonstrated natural and inborn causes and powers\r\nacquired by means of the stone, we will now examine the causes of magnetick\r\nvirtues in smelted iron that has not been excited by a stone. Loadstone and\r\niron furnish and exhibit to us wonderful subtilities. It has been\r\nrepeatedly shown above that iron not excited by a stone turns north and\r\nsouth; further that it has verticity, that is, special and peculiar polar\r\ndistinctions, just as a loadstone, or iron which has been rubbed upon a\r\nloadstone. This indeed seemed to us at first wonderful and incredible; the\r\nmetal of iron from the mine is smelted in the furnace; it runs out of the\r\nfurnace, and hardens into a great mass; this mass is divided in great\r\nworksteads, and is drawn into iron bars, from which smiths again construct\r\nmany instruments and necessary pieces of iron-work. Thus the same mass is\r\nvariously worked up and transformed into very many similitudes. What is it,\r\nthen, which {140} preserves its verticity, and whence is it derived? So\r\ntake this first from the above[212] smithy. Let the blacksmith beat out\r\nupon his anvil a glowing mass of iron of two or three ounces weight into an\r\niron spike of the length of a span of nine inches. Let the smith be\r\nstanding with his face to the north, his back to the south, so that * the\r\nhot iron on being struck has a motion of extension to the north; and let\r\nhim so complete his work with one or two heatings of the iron (if that be\r\nrequired); let him always, however, whilst he is striking the iron, direct\r\nand beat out the same point of it toward the north, and let him lay down\r\nthat end toward the north. Let him in this way complete two, three, or more\r\npieces of iron, nay, a hundred or four hundred; it is demonstrable that all\r\nthose which are thus beaten out toward the north, and so placed whilst they\r\nare cooling, turn round on their centres; and floating pieces of iron\r\n(being transfixed, of course, through suitable corks) make a motion in the\r\nwater, the determined end being toward the north. In the same way also\r\npieces of iron acquire verticity from their direction whilst they are being\r\nbeaten out and hammered or drawn out, * as iron wires are accustomed to do\r\ntoward some point of the horizon between east and south or between south\r\nand west, or in the opposite direction. Those, however, which are pointed\r\nor drawn out rather toward the eastern or western point, conceive * hardly\r\nany verticity or a very undecided one. That verticity is especially\r\nacquired by being beaten out. But a somewhat inferior iron ore, in which no\r\nmagnetick powers are apparent, if put in a * fire (its position being\r\nobserved to be toward the poles of the world or of the earth) and heated\r\nfor eight or ten hours, then cooled away from the fire, in the same\r\nposition towards the poles, acquires a verticity in accordance with the\r\nposition of its heating and cooling. Let a rod of cast iron be heated\r\nred-hot in a strong fire, in which it lies * meridionally (that is, along\r\nthe path of a meridian circle), and let be removed from the fire and\r\ncooled, and let it return to its former temperature, remaining in the same\r\nposition as before; then from this it will turn out that, if the same ends\r\nhave been turned to the same poles of the earth, it will acquire verticity,\r\nand the end which looked toward the North on water with a cork before the\r\nheating, if it have been placed during the heating and cooling toward the\r\nfourth, now turns round to the south. But if perchance sometimes the\r\nrotation have been doubtful and somewhat feeble, let it be placed again in\r\nthe fire, and when it is taken out at a red heat, let it be perfectly\r\ncooled toward the pole from which we desire the verticity, and the\r\nverticity will be acquired. Let the same rod be heated * in the contrary\r\nposition, and let it be placed so at a red heat it is cool; for it is from\r\nits position in cooling (by the operation of the verticity of the earth)\r\nthat verticity is put into the iron, and it turns round to parts contrary\r\nto its former verticity. So {141} the end which formerly looked toward the\r\nnorth now turns to the south. In accordance with these reasonings and in\r\nthese ways the boreal pole of the earth gives to the end of a piece of iron\r\nturned toward it a southern verticity, and that end is attracted by that\r\npole. * And here it must be observed that this happens to iron not only\r\nwhen it is cooled in the plane of the horizon, but also at any angle to it\r\nalmost up to the perpendicular toward the centre of the earth. So the\r\nheated iron conceives vigour and verticity from the earth more quickly in\r\nthe course of its return to its normal state, and in its recovery, as it\r\nwere (in the course of which it is transformed), than by its mere position\r\nalone. This is effected better and more * perfectly in winter and in colder\r\nair, when the metal returns more certainly to its natural temperature, than\r\nin summer and in warm regions. Let us see also what position alone and a\r\ndirection toward the poles of the earth can effect by itself without fire\r\nand heat. Iron rods which have been placed and fixed for a long time,\r\ntwenty * or more years, from south to north (as they not infrequently are\r\nfixed in buildings and across windows), those rods, I say, by that long\r\nlapse of time acquire verticity and turn round, whether hanging in the air,\r\nor floating (being placed on cork), to the pole toward which they were\r\npointing, and magnetically attract and repel a balanced iron magnetick; for\r\nthe long continued position of the body toward the poles is of much avail.\r\nThis fact (although conspicuous by manifest experiments) is confirmed by an\r\nincident related in an Italian letter[213] at the end of a book of Maestro\r\nFilippo Costa, of Mantua, _Sopra le Compositioni degli Antidoti_ written in\r\nItalian, which translated runs thus: \"A druggist of Mantua showed me a\r\npiece of iron entirely changed into a magnet, drawing another piece of iron\r\nin such a way that it could be compared with a loadstone. Now this piece of\r\niron, when it had for a long time held up a brick ornament on the top of\r\nthe tower of the church of St. Augustine at Rimini, had been at length bent\r\nby the force of the winds, and remained so for a period of ten years. When\r\nthe monks wished to bend it back to its former shape, and had handed it\r\nover to a blacksmith, a surgeon named Maestro Giulio Caesare discovered\r\nthat it was like a magnet and attracted iron.\" This was caused by the\r\nturning of its extremities toward the poles for so long a time. And so what\r\nhas been laid down before about change of verticity should be borne in\r\nmind; how in fact the poles of iron spikes are altered, when a loadstone is\r\nplaced against them only with its pole and points toward them, even at a\r\nrather long distance. Clearly it is in the same way that that large magnet\r\nalso (to wit, the earth itself) affects a piece of iron and changes its\r\nverticity. For, although the iron may not touch the pole of the earth, nor\r\nany magnetick part of the earth, yet verticity is acquired and changed; not\r\nbecause the poles of the earth and the point itself which is 39° distant\r\n{142} from our city of London, changes the verticity at a distance of so\r\nmany miles; but because the whole magnetick earth, that which projects to a\r\nconsiderable height, and to which the iron is near, and that which is\r\nsituated between us and the pole, and the vigour existing within the orbe\r\nof its magnetick virtue (the nature of the whole conspiring thereto),\r\nproduces the verticity. For the magnetick effluence of the earth rules\r\neverywhere within the orbe of its virtue, and transforms bodies; but those\r\nthings which are more similar to it, and specially connected with it by\r\nnature, it rules and controls; as loadstone and iron. Wherefore in very\r\nmany matters of business and actions it is clearly not superstitious and\r\nidle to observe the positions and conditions of lands, the points of the\r\nhorizon and the places of the stars. For as when a babe is brought forth\r\ninto the light from its mother's womb, and acquires respiration and certain\r\nanimal activities, then the planets and celestial bodies[214], according to\r\ntheir position in the universe, and according to that configuration which\r\nthey have with regard to the horizon and the earth, instil peculiar and\r\nindividual qualities into the newly born; so that piece of iron, whilst it\r\nis being formed and lengthened out, is affected by the common cause (to\r\nwit, the earth); whilst it is returning also from its heated condition to\r\nits former temperature, it is imbued with a special verticity in accord\r\nwith its position. Rather long pieces of iron sometimes have the same\r\nverticity * at each end; wherefore they have motions which are less certain\r\nand well ordered on account of their length and of the aforesaid processes,\r\nexactly as when an iron wire four feet long is rubbed at each end upon the\r\nsame pole of a loadstone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nWhy no other Body, excepting a magnetick, is imbued\r\n_with verticity by being rubbed on a loadstone; and why no_\r\nbody is able to instil and excite that virtue,\r\n_unless it be a magnetick._\r\n\r\nLigneous substances floating on water never by their own strength turn\r\nround toward the poles of the earth, save by chance. So wires of gold,\r\nsilver, brass, tin, lead, or glass, pushed through corks and floating, have\r\nno sure direction; and for this reason they do not show poles or points of\r\nvariation when rubbed with a loadstone. For those things which do not of\r\nthemselves incline toward the poles and obey the earth are also not ruled\r\nby {143} the touch of a loadstone; for the magnetick vigour has no entrance\r\ninto their inward parts; neither is the magnetick form received by them,\r\nnor are their forms magnetically excited; nor, if it did enter, would it\r\neffect anything, because in those bodies (mixed up with various kinds of\r\nefflorescent humours and forms, corrupted from the original property of the\r\nearth) there are no primary qualities. But those prime qualities of iron\r\nare excited by the juxtaposition of a loadstone, just as brute animals or\r\nmen, when they are awakened out of sleep, move and put forth their\r\nstrength. Here one must marvel at a demonstrable error of B. Porta, who,\r\nwhile rightly opposing a very old falsehood about the diamond, in speaking\r\nof a power contrary to that of the loadstone, introduces another still\r\nworse opinion; that forsooth iron, when touched by a diamond, turns to the\r\nnorth. \"If\" (he says) \"you rub a steel-Needle on a Diamond, and then put it\r\nin a Boat, or thrust it through a reed, or hang it up by a Thread, it will\r\npresently turn to the North, almost as well as if it had been touched with\r\nthe Loadstone; but something more faintly. And, what is worth noting, the\r\ncontrary part will turn the iron to the South: and when I had tried this in\r\nmany steel-Needles, and put them all into the Water, I found, that they all\r\nstood equi-distant, pointing to the North.\" This indeed would * be contrary\r\nto our magnetick rules. For this reason we made an experiment with seventy\r\nexcellent diamonds, in the presence of many witnesses, on a large number of\r\nspikes and wires, with the most careful precautions, floating (thrust, of\r\ncourse, through their corks) on the surface of water; never, however, could\r\nwe observe this. He was deceived by the verticity acquired from the earth\r\n(as stated above) in the spike or wire of iron itself, and the iron itself\r\nturned aside to its own definite pole; and he, being ignorant of this,\r\nthought it was done by the diamond. But let the investigators of natural\r\nphenomena take heed that they are not the more deceived by their own badly\r\nobserved experiments, and disturb the commonwealth of letters with their\r\nerrors and stupidities. Diamond is sometimes designated by the name of\r\n_Sideritis_, not because it is made of iron or because it draws iron, but\r\non account of its lustre, resembling flashing steel; with such a lustre do\r\nthe choicest pieces of diamond shine; hence by very many writers many\r\nqualities are imputed to diamond which really belong to siderite loadstone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{144} CHAP.

For if a loadstone or a piece of magnetick\r\niron, hanging in æquilibrium or floating on water, is attracted and\r\ndisposed toward certain definite points, when you bring above it a piece of\r\niron or another loadstone, it will not, if you afterward put the same[215]\r\nbelow it, turn round to the contrary parts; but the same ends of the iron\r\nor the loadstone will always be directed toward the same ends of the stone,\r\neven if the loadstone or the iron is suspended in any way in æquilibrium or\r\nis poised on a needle, so that it can turn round freely. He was deceived by\r\nthe irregular shape of some stone, or because he did not arrange the\r\nexperiment suitably. Wherefore he is led astray by a vain opinion, and\r\nthinks he may infer that, just as a stone has an arctic and antarctic pole,\r\nso also it has a western and an eastern, and an upper and a lower pole. So\r\nfrom foolish ideas conceived and admitted arise other fallacies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nThe Poles, Æquator, Centre in an entire Loadstone\r\n_remain and continue steady; by diminution and_\r\nseparation of some part they vary and\r\n_acquire other positions._\r\n\r\n[Illustration] *\r\n\r\nSuppose A B to be a terrella, whose centre is E, and whose diameter (as\r\nalso its æquinoctial circle) is D F. If you cut off a portion (through the\r\narctic circle, for example), G H, it is demonstrable that the pole which\r\nwas at A now has a position at I. But the centre and the æquinoctial recede\r\ntoward B {145} merely so that they are always in the middle of the mass\r\nthat is left between the plane of the arctick circle G I H and the\r\nantarctick pole B. Therefore the segment of the terrella comprised between\r\nthe plane of the former æquinoctial (that, of course, which was the æquator\r\nbefore cutting that part away) D E F and the newly acquired æquator M L N\r\nwill always be equal to the half of that part which was cut off, G I H A.\r\n[Illustration] * But if the portions have been taken away from the side C\r\nD, the poles and axis will not be in the line A B, but in E F, and the axis\r\nwould be changed in the same proportion as the æquator in the former\r\nfigure. For those positions of forces and virtues, or rather limits of the\r\nvirtues, which are derived from the whole form, are moved forward by change\r\nof quantity and shape; since all these limits arise from the conspiring\r\ntogether of the whole and of all {146} the parts united; and the verticity\r\nor the pole is not a virtue innate in one part, or in some definite limit,\r\nor fixed in the substance; but it is an inclination of the virtue to that\r\npart. And just as a terrella separated from the earth has no longer the\r\nearth's poles and æquator, but individual ones of its own; so also if it\r\nagain be divided, those limits and distinctions of the qualities and\r\nvirtues pass on to other parts. But if a loadstone be divided in any way,\r\neither along a parallel, or meridionally, so that by the change of shape\r\neither the poles or the æquator move to other positions, if the part cut\r\noff be merely applied in its natural position and joined to the whole, even\r\nwithout any agglutination or cementing together, the determining points of\r\nthe virtues return again to their former sites, as if no part of the body\r\nhad been cut off. When a body is entire, its form remains entire; but when\r\nthe body is lessened, a new whole is made, and there arises a new entirety,\r\ndetermined for every loadstone, however small, even for magnetick gravel,\r\nand for the finest sand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

In the\r\nformer condition, since the opposite portion of the stone increases the\r\nmass beyond the plane of the æquator, it strengthens also the verticity,\r\nand the potency, and the motion to unity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{147} CHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\nOn the Use and Excellence of Versoria: and how iron\r\n_versoria used as pointers in sun-dials, and the fine needles_\r\nof the mariners' compass, are to be rubbed, that\r\n_they may acquire stronger verticity._\r\n\r\nVersoria prepared by the loadstone subserve so many actions in human life\r\nthat it will not be out of place to record a better method of touching them\r\nand exciting them magnetically, and a suitable manner of operating. Rich\r\nores of iron and such as yield a greater proportion of metal are recognized\r\nby means of an iron needle suspended in æquilibrium and magnetically\r\nprepared; and magnetick stones, clays, and earths are distinguished,\r\nwhether crude or prepared. An iron needle (the soul of the mariners'\r\ncompass), the marvellous director in voyages and finger of God, one might\r\nalmost say, indicates the course, and has pointed out the whole way around\r\nthe earth (unknown for so many ages). The Spaniards (as also the English)\r\nhave frequently circumnavigated (by an immense circuit) the whole globe by\r\naid of the mariners' compass. Those who travel about through the world or\r\nwho sit at home have sun-dials. A magnetick pointer follows and searches\r\nout the veins of ore in mines. By its aid mines are driven in taking\r\ncities; catapults and engines of war are aimed by night; it has been of\r\nservice for the topography of places, for marking off the areas and\r\nposition of buildings, and for excavating aqueducts for water under ground.\r\nOn it depend instruments designed to investigate its own dip and variation.\r\n\r\nWhen iron is to be quickened by the stone, let it be clean and bright,\r\ndisfigured by no rust or dirt, and of the best steel[216]. Let the stone\r\nitself be wiped dry, and let it not be damp with any moisture, but let it\r\nbe filed gently with some smooth piece of iron. But the hitting of the\r\nstone with a hammer is of no advantage. By these means let their bare\r\nsurfaces be joined, and let them be rubbed, so that they may come together\r\nmore firmly; not so that the material substance of the stone being joined\r\nto the iron may cleave to it, but they are rubbed gently together with\r\nfriction, and (useless parts being rubbed off) they are intimately united;\r\nwhence a more notable [Illustration] virtue arises in the iron that is\r\nexcited. A is the best way of touching a versorium when the cusp touches\r\nthe pole and faces it; B is a moderately good way, when, though facing it,\r\nit is a little way {148} distant from the pole; also in like manner C is\r\nonly moderately good on account of the cusp being turned away from the\r\npole; D, which is farther distant, is hardly so good; F, which is prepared\r\ncrosswise along a parallel, is bad; of no virtue and entirely irresponsive\r\nand feeble is the magnetick index L, which is rubbed along the æquator;\r\noblique and not pointing towards the pole as G, and oblique, not pointing\r\ntoward but turned away from the pole as H, are bad. These have been placed\r\nso that they might indicate the distinct forces of a round stone. But\r\nmechanicians very often have a stone tending more to a cone shape, and more\r\npowerful on account of that shape since the pole, on which they rub their\r\nwires, is at the apex of the projecting part. Sometimes the stone has on\r\nthe top and above its own pole an artificial acorn or snout made of steel\r\nfor the sake of its power. Iron needles are rubbed on the top of this;\r\nwherefore they turn toward the same pole as if they had been prepared on\r\nthat part of the stone with the acorn removed. Let the stone be large\r\nenough and strong; the needle, even if it be rather long, should be\r\nsufficiently thick, not very slender; with a moderate cusp, not too sharp,\r\nalthough the virtue is not in the cusp itself only, but in the whole piece\r\nof iron. A strong large stone is not unfit for rubbing all needles on,\r\nexcepting that sometimes by its strength it occasions some dip and\r\ndisturbance in the iron in the case of longer needles; so that one which,\r\nhaving been touched before, rested in equilibrium in the plane of the\r\nhorizon, now when touched and excited dips at one end, as far as the\r\nupright pin on which it turns permits it. Wherefore in the case of longer\r\nversoria, the end which is going to be the Boreal, before it is rubbed,\r\nshould be a little lighter, so that it may remain exactly in æquilibrio\r\nafter it is touched. But a needle in this way prepared does its * {149}\r\nwork worse the farther it is beyond the æquinoctial circle. Let the\r\nprepared needle be placed in its capsule, and let it not be touched by any\r\nother magneticks, nor remain in the near vicinity of them, lest by their\r\nopposing forces, whether powerful or sluggish, it should become uncertain\r\nand dull. If you also rub the other end of the needle on the other pole of\r\nthe stone, the needle will perform its functions more steadily, especially\r\nif it be rather long. A piece of iron touched by a loadstone retains the\r\nmagnetick virtue, excited in it even for ages[217], firm and strong, if it\r\nis placed according to nature meridionally and not along a parallel, and is\r\nnot injured by rust or any external injury from the surrounding medium.\r\nPorta wrongly seeks for a proportion between the loadstone and the iron:\r\nbecause, he says, a little piece of iron will not be capable of holding\r\nmuch virtue; for it is consumed by the great force of the loadstone. A\r\npiece of iron receives its own virtue fully, even if it be only of the\r\nweight of one scruple, whilst the mass of the loadstone is a thousand\r\npounds. It is also useless to make the needle rather flat at the end that\r\nis touched, so that it may be better and more perfectly magnetick, and that\r\nit may best receive and hold certain magnetick particles; since hardly any\r\npart will stick on a sharp point; because he thought that it was by the\r\nadhesion of parts of the loadstone (as it were, hairs) that the influence\r\nis imparted and conserved, though those particles are merely rubbed off by\r\nthe rubbing of the iron over the softer stone, and the iron none the less\r\npoints toward the North and South, if after it is touched it be scoured\r\nwith sand or emery powder, or with any other material, even if by long\r\nrubbing of this kind the external parts of it are lessened and worn away.\r\nWhen a needle is being rubbed, one should always leave off at the end;\r\notherwise, if it is rubbed on the loadstone from the point toward the\r\nmiddle, less verticity is excited in the iron, sometimes none at all, or\r\nvery little. For where the last contact is, there is the pole and goal of\r\nverticity. In order that a stronger verticity may be produced in the iron\r\nby rubbing on the loadstone, one * ought in northern lands to turn the true\r\nnorthern pole of the loadstone toward the highest part of the sky; on this\r\npole that end of the needle is going to be rubbed, which shall afterwards\r\nturn toward the north of the earth; whilst it will be an advantage for the\r\nother end of the needle to be rubbed on the southern pole of the terrella\r\nturned toward the earth, and this being so excited will incline toward the\r\nsouth. In southern regions beyond the æquator the plan is just the\r\ncontrary. The reason of this dissimilarity is demonstrated, Book II., chap,\r\nxxxiv., in which it is shown (by a manifest combination of a terrella and\r\nthe earth) why the poles of a loadstone, for different reasons, are one\r\nstronger than the other. If a needle be touched between the mutually\r\naccordant * poles of two loadstones, equal in power, shape, and mass, no\r\nstrength {150} [Illustration] is acquired by the needle. A and B are two\r\nloadstones attracting one another, according to nature, at their dissimilar\r\nends; C, the * point of a needle touched by both at once, is not excited\r\n(even if those loadstones be connected according to nature), if they are\r\nequal; but if they are not equal, virtue is acquired from the stronger.\r\nWhen a needle is being excited by a loadstone, begin in the middle, and\r\ndraw the needle toward its end; at the end let the application be continued\r\nwith a very gentle rubbing around the end for some time; that is to say,\r\nfor one or two minutes; do not repeat the motion from the middle to the end\r\n(as is frequently done) for in this way the verticity is injured. Some\r\ndelay is desirable, for although the power is imparted instantly, and the\r\niron excited, yet from the vicinity of the loadstone and a suitable delay,\r\na more steady verticity arises, and one that is more firmly durable in the\r\niron. Although an armed stone raises a greater weight of iron than an\r\nunarmed one, yet a needle is not more strongly excited by an armed stone\r\nthan by an unarmed one. Let there be two iron wires of the same length,\r\nwrought from the same wire; let one be excited by an armed end, the other\r\nby an unarmed end; it is manifest that the same needles have a beginning of\r\nmotion or a sensible inclination at equal distances from the same armed and\r\nunarmed loadstone; this is ascertained by measuring with a longish reed.\r\nBut objects which are more powerfully excited move more quickly; those\r\nwhich are less powerfully excited, more feebly, and not unless brought\r\nrather close; the experiment is made on water with equal corks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{151} [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBOOK FOURTH.\r\n\r\n_CHAP. I._\r\n\r\nON VARIATION.\r\n\r\nDirection has hitherto been spoken of as if in nature there were no\r\nvariation; for in the preceding natural history we wished to omit and\r\nneglect this, inasmuch as in a terrestrial globe, perfect and in every\r\nsense complete, there would be none. Since, however, in fact, the earth's\r\nmagnetick direction, owing to some fault and slip, deviates from its right\r\ncourse and from the meridian, we must extract and demonstrate the obscure\r\nand hidden cause of that variance which has troubled and sore racked in\r\nvain the minds of many. Those who before us have written on the magnetick\r\nmovements have made no distinction between direction and variation, but\r\nconsider the motion of magnetick iron to be uniform and simple. Now true\r\ndirection is the motion of the magnetick body to the true meridian and its\r\ncontinuance therein with its appropriate ends towards the poles. But it\r\nvery often happens at sea and on land that the magnetick iron does not\r\npoint to the true pole, and that not only a versorium and magnetick pieces\r\nof iron, and the needle of a compass, or a mariners' compass, but also a\r\nterrella in its boat, as well as * iron ore, iron stones, and magnetick\r\nearths, properly prepared, are drawn aside and deviate towards some point\r\nof the Horizon very near to the meridian. For they with their poles\r\nfrequently face termini away from the meridian. This variation {152}\r\n(observed by means of instruments or a nautical variation compass) is\r\ntherefore the arc of the horizon between the common point of intersecion of\r\nit with the true meridian, and the terminus of the deflecion on the horizon\r\nor projection of the deviating needle. That arc varies and differs with\r\nchange of locality. To the terminus of the variation is commonly assigned a\r\ngreat circle, called the circle of variation, and also a magnetick meridian\r\npassing through the zenith and the point of variation on the horizon. In\r\nthe northern regions of the earth this variation is either from the north\r\ntoward the east or from the north toward the west: similarly in the\r\nsouthern regions it is from the south toward the east or toward the west.\r\nWherefore one should observe in the northern regions of the earth * that\r\nend of the versorium or compass which turns toward the North; but in the\r\nsouthern regions the other end looking to the south--which seamen and\r\nsciolists for the most part do not understand, for in both regions they\r\nobserve only the boreal lily of the compass (that which faces North). We\r\nhave before said that all the motions of the magnet and iron, all its\r\nturning, its inclination, and its settlement, proceed from bodies\r\nthemselves magnetical and from their common mother the earth, which is the\r\nsource, the propagatrix, and the origin of all these qualities and\r\nproperties. Accordingly the earth is the cause of this variation and\r\ninclination toward a different point of the horizon: but how and by what\r\npowers must be more fully investigated. And here we must at the outset\r\nreject that common opinion of recent writers concerning magnetick\r\nmountains, or any magnetick rock, or any phantasmal pole distant from the\r\npole of the earth, by which the motion of the compass or versorium is\r\ncontrolled. This opinion, previously invented by others, Fracastorio\r\nhimself adopted and developed; but it is entirely at variance with\r\nexperience. For in that case in different places at sea and on land the\r\npoint of variation would change toward the east or west in proportion and\r\ngeometrical symmetry, and the versorium would always respect the magnetick\r\npole: but experience teaches that there is no such definite pole or fixed\r\nterminus on the earth to account for the variation. For the arcs of *\r\nvariation are changed variously and erratically, not only on different\r\nmeridians but on the same meridian; and when, according to this opinion of\r\nthe moderns, the deviation should be more and more toward the east, then\r\nsuddenly, with a small change of locality, the deviation is from the north\r\ntoward the west as in the northern regions near Nova Zembla. Moreover, in\r\nthe southern regions, and at sea at a great distance from the æquator\r\ntowards the antarctick pole, there are frequent and great variations, and\r\nnot only in the northern regions, from the magnetick mountains. But the\r\ncogitations of others are still more vain and trifling, such as that of\r\nCortes about a moving influence beyond all the heavens; that of {153}\r\nMarsilius Ficinus about a star in the Bear; that of Peter Peregrinus about\r\nthe pole of the world; that of Cardan, who derives it from the rising of a\r\nstar in the tail of the Bear[218]; of Bessardus, the Frenchman, from the\r\npole of the Zodiack; that of Livio Sanuto from some magnetick meridian;\r\nthat of Franciscus Maurolycus from a magnetical island; that of Scaliger\r\nfrom the heavens and mountains; that of Robert Norman, the Englishman, from\r\na point respective. Leaving therefore these opinions, which are at variance\r\nwith common experience or by no means proved, let us seek the true cause of\r\nthe variation. The great magnet or terrestrial globe directs iron (as I\r\nhave said) toward the north and south; and excited iron quickly settles\r\nitself toward those termini. Since, however, the globe of the earth is\r\ndefective and uneven on its surface and marred by its diverse composition,\r\nand since it has parts very high and convex (to the height of some miles),\r\nand those uniform neither in composition nor body, but opposite and\r\ndissimilar: it comes to pass that the whole of that force of the earth\r\ndiverts magnetical bodies in its periphery toward the stronger and more\r\nprominent connected magnetick parts. Hence on the outermost surface of the\r\nearth magnetical bodies are slightly perverted from the true meridian.\r\nMoreover, since the surface of the globe is divided into high lands and\r\ndeep seas, into great continental lands, into ocean and vastest seas, and\r\nsince the force of all magnetical motions is derived from the constant and\r\nmagnetick terrestrial nature which is more prevalent on the greater\r\ncontinent and not in the aquæous or fluid or unstable part; [219]it follows\r\nthat in certain parts there would be a magnetick inclination from the true\r\npole east or west away from any meridian (whether passing through seas or\r\nislands) toward a great land or continent rising higher, that is, obviously\r\ntoward a stronger and more elevated magnetick part of the terrestrial\r\nglobe. For since the diameter of the earth is more than 1,700 German miles,\r\nthose large lands can rise from the centre of the earth more than four\r\nmiles above the depth of the ocean bottom, and yet the earth will retain\r\nthe form of a globe although somewhat uneven at the top. Wherefore a\r\nmagnetical body is turned aside, so far as the true verticity, when\r\ndisturbed, admits, and departs from its right (the whole earth moving it)\r\ntoward a vast prominent mass of land as though toward what is stronger. But\r\nthe variation does really take place, not so much because of the more\r\nprominent and imperfect terrestrial parts and continent lands as because of\r\nthe inæquality of the magnetick globe, and because of the real earth, which\r\nstands out more under the continent lands than under the depths of the\r\nseas. We must see, therefore, how the _apodixis_ of this theory can be\r\nsustained by more definite observations. Since throughout all the course\r\nfrom the coast of Guinea to Cape Verde, the Canary Isles, and the border of\r\nthe kingdom of Morocco, and {154} thence along the coasts of Spain, France,\r\nEngland, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, and Norway, there lie on the right hand\r\nand toward the east a continent and extensive connected regions, and on the\r\nleft extensive seas and a vast ocean lie open far and wide, it is consonant\r\nwith the theory (as has been carefully observed by many) that magnetical\r\nbodies should turn slightly to the East from the true pole toward the\r\nstronger and more remarkable elevations of the earth. But it is far\r\notherwise on the eastern shores of northern America; for from Florida by\r\nVirginia and Norumbega to Cape Race and away to the north the versorium is\r\nturned toward the west. But in the middle spaces, so to speak, as in the\r\nmore westerly Azores, it looks toward the true pole. That any magnetick\r\nbody turns itself similarly to the same regions of the earth is not,\r\nhowever, because of that meridian or because of the concordancy of the\r\nmeridian with any magnetick pole, as the crowd of philosophizers reckon,\r\nfor it is not so throughout the whole of that meridian. For on the same\r\nmeridian * near Brazil something very different occurs, as we will show\r\nfurther on. The variation (cæteris paribus) is always less near the\r\næquator, greater in higher latitudes, with the limitation that it be not\r\nvery near the pole itself. Hence the variation is greater on the coast of *\r\nNorway and Belgium than on the coast of Morocco or Guinea: greater also\r\nnear Cape Race than in the harbours of Norumbega or of Virginia. On the\r\ncoast of Guinea magnetick implements deviate by a third part of one rumbe\r\nto the East: in Cape Verde Islands by a half: on the coast of Morocco by\r\ntwo thirds: in England at the mouth of the Thames by a whole rumbe: and at\r\nLondon by nearly eleven degrees and one third. For indeed the moving\r\nmagnetick virtue is stronger in a higher latitude; and the larger regions\r\nextending toward the poles dominate the more, as is easily apparent\r\nanywhere on a terrella. For as in the case of true Direction magnetick\r\nbodies tend toward the pole (namely, toward the stronger end, the whole\r\nearth causing the motion), so also do they incline a little toward the\r\nstronger and higher parts by the action of the whole along with the\r\nconjoint action of iron bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{155} CHAP. II.\r\n\r\nThat the variation is caused by the inæquality of the\r\n_projecting parts of the earth_.\r\n\r\nDemonstration of this may manifestly be made [Illustration] * by means of a\r\nterrella in the following way: let there be a round loadstone somewhat\r\nimperfect in some part, and impaired by decay (such an one we had with a\r\ncertain part corroded to resemble the Atlantick or great Ocean): place upon\r\nit some fine iron wire of the length of two barleycorns, as in the\r\nfollowing figure. A B, a Terrella in certain parts somewhat imperfect and\r\nof unæqual virtue on the circumference. The versoria E, F, do not vary, but\r\nlook directly to the pole A; for they are placed in the middle of the firm\r\nand sound part of the terrella and somewhat distant from the imperfect\r\npart: that part of the surface which is distinguished by dots and\r\ntransverse lines is the weaker. The versorium O also does not vary (because\r\nit is placed in the middle of the imperfect part), but is directed toward\r\nthe pole, {156} just as near the western Azores on the earth. The versoria\r\nH and L do vary, for they incline toward the sounder parts very near them.\r\nAs this is manifest in a terrella whose surface is sensibly rather\r\nimperfect, so also is it in others whole and perfect, when often one part\r\nof the stone has stronger external parts, which nevertheless do not\r\ndisclose themselves manifestly to the senses. In such a terrella the\r\ndemonstration of the variation and the discovery of the stronger parts is\r\non this wise. [Illustration] * Let A be the pole, B the place of the\r\nvariation, C the stronger regions; then the horizontal versorium at B\r\nvaries from the pole A toward C: so that both the variation is shown and\r\nthe stronger places of the loadstone recognized. The stronger surface is\r\nalso found by a fine iron wire of the length of two barleycorns: for since\r\nat the pole of the terrella it rears up perpendicularly, but in other\r\nplaces inclines toward the æquator, if in one and the same parallel circle\r\nit should be more erect in one place than in another; where the wire is\r\nraised more upright, there the part and surface of the terrella is\r\nstronger. Also when the iron wire placed over the pole inclines more to one\r\npart than to another. [Illustration] * {157} Let the experiment be made by\r\nmeans of a fine iron wire of three digits length placed over the pole A, so\r\nthat its middle lies over the pole. Then one end is turned away from B\r\ntoward C, and is not willing to lie quietly toward B; but on a terrella\r\nwhich is perfect[220] all round and even it rests on the pole directed\r\ntoward any point of the æquator you please. Otherwise, let there be two *\r\n[Illustration] meridians meeting in the poles A B, let iron wires be reared\r\njust at the ends D and C of the equal arcs D A and C A; then the wire at D\r\n(the stronger region) will be more raised up than that at C, the weaker.\r\nAnd thus the sounder and stronger part of the loadstone is recognized,\r\nwhich otherwise would not be perceived by the touch. In a terrella which is\r\nperfect, and even, and similar in all its parts, there is, at equal\r\ndistances from the pole, no variation[221]. Variation is shown by means of\r\na terrella, a considerable part of which, forming a surface a little higher\r\nthan the rest, does, although it be not decayed and broken, allure the\r\nversorium from the true * direction (the whole terrella co-operating).\r\n\r\nA terrella uneven in surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] {158} It is shown by a small spike placed over a terrella or\r\nby a small versorium; for they are turned by the terrella toward the mass\r\nthat stands out and toward the large eminences. In the same way on the\r\nearth the verticity is perturbed by great continents, which are mostly\r\nelevated above the depths of the seas and make the versorium deviate\r\nsometimes from the right tracks (that is, from the true meridians). On a\r\nterrella it is thus demonstrated: the end of the versorium A is not\r\ndirected straight to the pole P, if there be a large protuberance B on the\r\nterrella; so also the cusp C deviates from the pole because of the eminence\r\nF. In the middle between the two eminences the versorium G collimates to\r\nthe true pole because, being at equal distances from the two eminences B\r\nand F, it turns aside to neither, but observes the true meridian,\r\nespecially when the protuberances are of equal vigour. But the versorium N\r\non the other side varies from the pole M toward the eminences H, and is not\r\nheld back, stopped, or restrained by the small eminence O on the terrella\r\n(as it were, some island of land in the ocean). L, however, being\r\nunimpeded, is directed to the pole M. The variation is demonstrated in\r\nanother way on a terrella, just as on the earth. Let A be the pole of the\r\nearth, B the equator, C the parallel circle of latitude of 30 degrees, D a\r\ngreat eminence spread out toward the pole, E another eminence spread out\r\nfrom the pole toward the æquator. It is manifest that in the middle of D\r\nthe versorium F {159} does not vary; while G is very greatly deflected: but\r\nH very little, because it is further removed from D. Similarly also the\r\nversorium I placed directly toward E does not deviate from the pole: but L\r\nand M turn themselves away from the pole A toward the eminence E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nThe variation in any one place\r\n_is constant_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVnless there should be a great dissolution of a continent and a subsidence\r\nof the land such as there was of the region Atlantis of which Plato and the\r\nancients tell, the variation will continue perpetually immutable; the arc\r\nof the variation remains the same in the same place or region, whether it\r\nbe at sea or on land, as in times past a magnetick body has declined toward\r\nthe East or the West. The constancy of the variation and the pointing of\r\nthe versorium to a definite point on the horizon in individual regions is\r\ndemonstrated by a small versorium placed over a terrella the surface of\r\nwhich is uneven: for it always deviates from the meridian by an equal arc.\r\nIt is also shown by the inclination of a versorium toward a second magnet;\r\nalthough in reality it is by the turning power of the whole, whether in the\r\nearth or in a terrella. Place upon a plane a versorium whose cusp is\r\ndirected toward the north A: place beside it a loadstone, B, at such a\r\ndistance that the versorium may turn aside toward B to the point C, and not\r\nbeyond. Then move the needle of the versorium as often as you will (the box\r\nand the loadstone not being moved), and it will certainly always return to\r\nthe point C. In the same manner, if you {160} placed the stone so that it\r\nmay be truly directed toward E, the cusp always reverts to E, and not to\r\nany other point of the compass. Accordingly, from the position of the land\r\nand from the distinctive nature of the highest parts of the earth (certain\r\nterrene and more magnetick eminences of the regions prevailing), the\r\nvariation indeed becomes definite in one and the same place, but diverse\r\nand unæqual from a change of place, since the true and polar direction\r\noriginating in the whole terrestrial globe is diverted somewhat toward\r\ncertain stronger eminences on the broken surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\nThe arc of variation is not changed equally\r\n_in proportion to the distance of places_.\r\n\r\nIn the open sea, when a vessel is borne by a favourable wind along the same\r\nparallel, if the variation be changed by one degree in the course of one\r\nhundred miles, the next hundred miles do not therefore lessen it by another\r\ndegree; for the magnetick [needle] varies erratically as respects position,\r\nform, and vigour of the land, and also because of the distance. As, for\r\nexample, when a course from the Scilly Isles to Newfoundland has proceeded\r\nso far that the compass is directed to the true pole, then, as the vessel\r\nproceeds, in the first part of the course the variation increases toward\r\nthe north-west[222], but rather indistinctly and with small difference:\r\nthence, after an equal distance, the arc is increased in a greater\r\nproportion until the vessel is not far from the continent: for then it\r\nvaries most of all. But before it touches actual land or enters port, then\r\nat a certain distance the arc is again slightly diminished. But if the\r\nvessel in its course should decline greatly from that parallel either\r\ntoward the south or the north, the magnetick [needle] will vary more or\r\nless, according to the position of the land and the latitude * of the\r\nregion. For (cæteris paribus) the greater the latitude the greater the\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{161} CHAP. V.\r\n\r\nAn island in Ocean does not change the variation[223], as\r\n_neither do mines of loadstone_.\r\n\r\nIslands, although they be more magnetick than the sea, yet do not change\r\nthe magnetick directions or variations. For since direction is a motion\r\nderived from the power of the whole earth, not from the attraction of any\r\nhill but from the disposing and turning power of the whole; so variation\r\n(which is a perturbation of the direction) is an aberration of the real\r\nturning power arising from the great inequalities of the earth, in\r\nconsequence of which it, of itself, slightly diverts movable magneticks\r\ntoward those which are the largest and the more powerful. The cause now\r\nshown may suffice to explain that which some so wonder at about the Island\r\nof Elba (and although this is productive of loadstone, yet the versorium\r\n(or mariners' compass) makes no special inclination toward it whenever\r\nvessels approach it in the Tyrrhenian sea); and the following causes are\r\nalso to be considered, viz.: that the virtue of smaller magnetick bodies\r\nextends scarcely or not at all of itself beyond their own mines: for\r\nvariation does not occur because of attraction, as they would have it who\r\nhave imagined magnetick poles. Besides, magnetick mines are only agnate to\r\nthe true earth, not innate: hence the whole globe does not regard them, and\r\nmagneticks are not borne to them, as is demonstrated by the diagram of\r\neminences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nThat variation and direction arise from the disponent\r\n_power of the earth, and from the natural magnetick tendency_\r\nto rotation, not from attraction, or from coition,\r\n_or from other occult cause_.\r\n\r\nOwing to the loadstone being supposed (amongst the crowd of philosophizers)\r\nto seize and drag, as it were, magnetick bodies; and since, in truth,\r\nsciolists have remarked no other forces than those so oft besung of\r\nattractive ones, they therefore deem every motion toward the north and\r\nsouth to be caused by some alluring and inviting quality. But the\r\nEnglishman, {162} Robert Norman, first strove to show that it is not caused\r\nby attraction: wherefore, as if tending toward hidden principles, he\r\nimagined a _point respective_[224], toward which the iron touched by a\r\nloadstone would ever turn, not a _point attractive_; but in this he erred\r\ngreatly, although he effaced the former error about attraction. He,\r\nhowever, demonstrates his opinion in this way:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet there be a round vessel filled with water: in the middle of the surface\r\nof the water place a slender iron wire on a perfectly round cork, so that\r\nit may just float in æquilibrium on the water; let the wire be previously\r\ntouched by a magnet, so that it may more readily show the point of\r\nvariation, the point D as it were: and let it remain on the surface for\r\nsome time. It is demonstrable that the wire together with the cork is not\r\nmoved to the side D of the vessel: which it would do if an attraction came\r\nto the iron wire by D: and the cork would be moved out of its place. This\r\nassertion of the Englishman, Robert Norman, is plausible and appears to do\r\naway with attraction because the iron remains on the water not moving\r\nabout, as well in a direction toward the pole itself (if the direction be\r\ntrue) as in a variation or altered direction; and it is moved about its own\r\ncentre without any transference to the edge of the vessel. But direction\r\ndoes not arise from attraction, but from the disposing and turning power\r\nwhich exists in the whole earth, not in the pole or in some other\r\nattracting part of the stone, or in any mass rising above the periphery of\r\nthe true circle so that a [Illustration] variation should occur because of\r\nthe attraction of that mass. Moreover, it is the directing power of the\r\nloadstone and iron and its natural power of turning around the centre which\r\ncause the motion of direction, and of conformation, in which is included\r\nalso the motion of the dip. And the terrestrial pole does not attract as if\r\nthe terrene force were implanted only in the pole, for the magnetick force\r\nexists in the whole, although it predominates and excels at the pole.\r\nWherefore that the cork should rest quiescent in the middle and that the\r\niron excited by a loadstone should not be moved toward the side of the\r\nvessel are agreeable to and in conformity {163} with the magnetick nature,\r\nas is demonstrated by a terrella: for an iron spike placed on the stone at\r\nC clings on at C, and is not pulled * further away by the pole A, or by the\r\nparts near the pole: hence it persists at D, and takes a direction toward\r\nthe pole A; nevertheless it clings on at D and dips also at D in virtue of\r\nthat turning power by which it conforms itself to the terrella: of which we\r\nwill say more in the part _On Declination_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nWhy the variation from that lateral cause is not\r\n_greater than has hitherto been observed, having been_\r\nrarely seen to reach two points of the mariners'\r\n_compass, except near the pole_.\r\n\r\nThe earth, by reason of lateral eminences of the stronger globe, diverts\r\niron and loadstone by some degrees from the true pole, or true meridian.\r\nAs, for example, with us English at London it varies eleven degrees and\r\n1/3: in some other places the variation is a little greater, but in no\r\nother region is the end of the iron ever moved aside very much more from\r\nthe meridian. For as the iron is always directed by the true verticity of\r\nthe earth, so the polar nature of the continent land (just as of the whole\r\nterrene globe) acts toward the poles: and even if that mass divert\r\nmagnetick bodies from the meridian, yet the verticity of those lands (as\r\nalso of the whole earth) controls and disposes them so that they do not\r\nturn toward the East by any greater arc. But it is not easy to determine by\r\nany general method how great the arc of variation is in all places, and how\r\nmany degrees and minutes it subtends on the horizon, since it becomes\r\ngreater or less {164} from diverse causes. For both the strength of true\r\nverticity of the place and of the elevated regions, as well as their\r\ndistances from the given place and from the poles of the world, must be\r\nconsidered and compared; which indeed cannot be done exactly: nevertheless\r\nby our method the variation becomes so known that no grave error will\r\nperturb the course at sea. If the positions of the lands were uniform and\r\nstraight along meridians, and not defective and rugged, the variations near\r\nlands would be simple; such as appear in the following figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is demonstrated by a long loadstone the poles of which are in the ends\r\nA B; let C D be the middle line and the æquinoctial, and let G H and E F\r\n(the lines) be for meridians on which versoria are disposed, the variations\r\nof which are greater at a greater distance from the æquator. But the\r\ninequalities of the maritime parts of the habitable earth, the enormous\r\npromontories, the very wide gulfs, the mountainous and more elevated\r\nregions, render the variations more unequal, or sudden, or more obscure;\r\nand, moreover, less certain and more inconstant in the higher latitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{165} CHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOn the construction of the common mariners'\r\ncompass[225], and on the diversity of the compasses\r\n_of different nations_.\r\n\r\nIn a round[226] hollow wooden bowl, all the upper part of which is closed\r\nwith glass, a versorium is placed upon a rather long pin which is fixed in\r\nthe middle. The covering prevents the wind, and the motion of air from any\r\nexternal cause. Through the glass everything within can be discerned. The\r\nversorium is circular, consisting of some light material (as card), to the\r\nunder part of which the magnetick pieces of iron are attached. On the upper\r\npart 32 spaces (which are commonly called _points_) are assigned to the\r\nsame number of mathematical intervals in the horizon or winds which are\r\ndistinguished by certain marks and by a lily indicating the north. The bowl\r\nis suspended in the plane of the horizon in æquilibrium in a brass ring\r\nwhich also is itself suspended transversely in another ring within a box\r\nsufficiently wide with a leaden weight attached; hence it conforms to the\r\nplane of the horizon even though the ship be tossed to and fro by the\r\nwaves. The iron works are either a pair with their ends united, or else a\r\nsingle one of a nearly oval shape with projecting ends, which does its work\r\nmore certainly and more quickly. This is to be fitted to the cardboard\r\ncircle so that the centre of the circle may be in the middle of the\r\nmagnetick iron. But inasmuch as variation arises horizontally from the\r\npoint of the meridian which cuts the horizon at right angles, therefore on\r\naccount of the variation the makers in different regions and cities mark\r\nout the mariners' compass in different ways, and also attach in different\r\nways the magnetick needles to the cardboard circle on which are placed the\r\n32 divisions or points. Hence there are commonly in Europe 4 different\r\nconstructions and forms. First that of the States on the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nSicily, Genoa, and the Republick of Venice. In all these the needles are\r\nattached under the rose or lily on the cardboard versorium, so that (where\r\nthere is no variation) they are directed to the true north and south\r\npoints. Wherefore the north part marked with the lily always shows exactly\r\nthe point of variation when the apex itself of the lily on the movable\r\ncircle, together with the ends of the magnetick wires attached below, rests\r\nat the point of variation. Yet another is that of Dantzig, and throughout\r\nthe Baltic Sea, and the Belgian provinces; {166} in which the iron works\r\nfixed below the circle diverge from the lily ¼ of a rumbe to the east. For\r\nnavigation to Russia the divergency is 2/3. But the compasses which are\r\nmade at Seville, Lisbon, Rochelle, Bordeaux, Rouen, and throughout all\r\nEngland have an interval of ½ a rumbe. From those differences most serious\r\nerrors have arisen in navigation, and in the marine science. For as soon as\r\nthe bearings of maritime places (such as promontories, havens, islands)\r\nhave been first found by the aid of the mariners' compass, and the times of\r\nsea-tide or high water determined from the position of the moon over this\r\nor that point (as they say) of the compass, it must be further inquired in\r\nwhat region or according to the custom of what region that compass was made\r\nby which the bearings of those places and the times of the sea-tides were\r\nfirst observed and discovered. For one who should use the British compass\r\nand should follow the directions of the marine charts of the Mediterranean\r\nSea would necessarily wander very much out of the straight course. So also\r\nhe that should use the Italian compass in the British, German, or Baltic\r\nSea, together with marine charts that are made use of in those parts, will\r\noften stray from the right way. These different constructions have been\r\nmade on account of the dissimilar variations, so that they might avoid\r\nsomewhat serious errors in those parts of the world. But Pedro Nuñez seeks\r\nthe meridian by the mariners' compass, or versorium (which the Spanish call\r\nthe needle), without taking account of the variation: and he adduces many\r\ngeometrical demonstrations which (because of his slight use and experience\r\nin matters magnetical) rest on utterly vicious foundations. In the same\r\nmanner Pedro de Medina, since he did not admit variation, has disfigured\r\nhis _Arte de Navegar_ with many errors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nWhether the terrestrial longitude can be found from\r\n_the variation_.\r\n\r\nGrateful would be this work to seamen, and would bring the greatest advance\r\nto Geography. But B. Porta in chap. 38 of book 7 is mocked by a vain hope\r\nand fruitless opinion. For when he supposes that the magnetick needle would\r\nfollow order and proportion in moving along meridians, so that \"the neerer\r\nit is to the east, the more it will decline from the Meridian line, toward\r\nthe east; and the neerer it comes to the west, the {167} point of the\r\nneedle will decline the more to the west\" (which is totally untrue), he\r\nthinks that he has discovered a true index of longitude. But he is\r\nmistaken. Nevertheless, admitting and assuming these things (as though they\r\nwere perfectly true), he makes a large compass indicating degrees and\r\nminutes, by which these proportional changes of the versorium might be\r\nobserved. But those very principles are false, and ill conceived, and very\r\nill considered; for the versorium does not turn more to the east because a\r\njourney is made toward the east: and although the variation in the more\r\nwesterly parts of Europe and the adjoining ocean is to the east and beyond\r\nthe Azores is changed a little to the west, yet the variation is, in\r\nvarious ways, always uncertain, both on account of longitude and of\r\nlatitude, and because of the approach toward extensive tracts of land, and\r\nalso because of the form of the dominant terrestrial eminences; nor does\r\nit, as we have before demonstrated, follow the rule of any particular\r\nmeridian. It is with the same vanity also that Livio Sanuto so greatly\r\ntorments himself and his readers. As for the fact that the crowd of\r\nphilosophizers and sailors suppose that the meridian passing through the\r\nAzores marks the limits of variation, so that on the other and opposite\r\nside of that meridian a magnetick body necessarily respects the poles\r\nexactly, which is also the opinion of Joannes Baptista Benedictus and of\r\nmany other writers on navigation, it is by no means true. Stevinus (on the\r\nauthority of Hugo Grotius) in his _Havenfinding Art_ distinguishes the\r\nvariation according to the meridians: \"It may be seene in the Table of\r\nvariations, that in _Coruo_ the Magneticall needle pointeth due North: but\r\nafter that, the more a man shal goe towards the East, so much the more also\r\nshall he see the needle varie towards the East [[Greek: anatolizein]], till\r\nhe come one mile to the Eastward from _Plimouth_, where the variation\r\ncomming to the greatest is 13 degr. 24 min. From hence the Northeasting\r\n[Anatolismus] beginneth to decrease, til you come to _Helmshude_ (which\r\nplace is Westward from the North Cape of Finmark) where againe the needle\r\npointeth due North. Now the longitude from _Coruo_ to _Helmshude_ is 60\r\ndegr. Which things being well weighed, it appeareth that the greatest\r\nvariation [Chalyboclysis] 13 degr. 24 minutes at _Plimmouth_ (the longitude\r\nwhereof is 30 degr.) is in the midst betweene the places where the needle\r\npointeth due North.\" But although this is in some part true in these\r\nplaces, yet it is by no means true that along the whole of the meridian of\r\nthe island of Corvo the versorium looks truly to the north; nor on the\r\nmeridian of Plymouth is the variation in other places 13 deg. 24 min.--nor\r\nagain in other parts of the meridian of Helmshuda does it point to the true\r\npole. For on the meridian passing through Plymouth in Latitude 60 degrees\r\nthe North-easterly variation is greater: in Latitude 40 deg. much less; in\r\nLatitude 20 deg. very small indeed. On the meridian of Corvo, although\r\nthere is no variation near the {168} island, yet in Latitude 55 degrees the\r\nvariation is about ½ a rumbe to the North-west; in Latitude 20 deg. the\r\nversorium inclines ¼ of a rumbe toward the East. Consequently the limits of\r\nvariation are not conveniently determined by means of great circles and\r\nmeridians, and much less are the ratios of the increment or decrement\r\ntoward any part of the heavens properly investigated by them. Wherefore the\r\nrules of the abatement or augmentation of Northeasting or Northwesting, or\r\nof increasing or decreasing the magnetick deviation, can by no means be\r\ndiscovered by such an artifice. The rules which follow later for variation\r\nin southern parts of the earth investigated by the same method are\r\naltogether vain and absurd. They were put forth by certain Portuguese\r\nmariners, but they do not agree with the observations, and the observations\r\nthemselves are admitted to be bad. But the method of haven-finding in long\r\nand distant voyages by carefully observed variation (such as was invented\r\nby Stevinus, and mentioned by Grotius) is of great moment, if only proper\r\ninstruments are in readiness, by which the magnetick deviation can be\r\nascertained with certainty at sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nWhy in various places near the pole the variations\r\nare much more ample than in a\r\n_lower latitude_.\r\n\r\nVariations are often slight, and generally null, when the versorium is at\r\nor near the earth's æquator. In a higher Latitude of 60, 70 or 80 deg.\r\nthere are not seldom very wide variations. The cause of this is to be\r\nsought partly from the nature of the earth and partly from the disposition\r\nof the versorium. The earth turns magnetick bodies and at the æquator\r\ndirects them strongly toward the pole: [227]at the poles there is no\r\ndirection, but only a strong coition through the congruent poles. Direction\r\nis therefore weaker near the poles, because by reason of its own natural\r\ntendency to turn, the versorium dips very much, and is not strongly\r\ndirected. But since the force of those elevated lands is more vigorous, for\r\nthe virtue flows from the whole globe, and since also the causes of\r\nvariation are nearer, therefore the versorium deflects the more from its\r\ntrue direction toward those eminences. It must also be known that the\r\ndirection of the versorium on its pin along the plane of the Horizon is\r\nmuch stronger at the æquator than anywhere else by reason of the\r\ndisposition of the {169} versorium; and this direction falls off with an\r\nincrease of latitude. For on the æquator the versorium is, following its\r\nnatural property, directed along the plane of the horizon; but in other\r\nplaces it is, contrary to its natural property, compelled into æquilibrium,\r\nand remains there, compelled by some external force: because it would,\r\naccording to its natural property, dip below the horizon in proportion to\r\nthe latitude, as we shall demonstrate in the book _On Declination_. Hence\r\nthe direction falls off and at the pole is itself nothing: and for that\r\nreason a feebler direction is easily vanquished by the stronger causes of\r\nvariation, and near the pole the versorium deflects the more from the\r\nmeridian. It is demonstrated by means of a terrella: if an iron wire of two\r\ndigits length be placed on its æquator, it will be strongly and rapidly\r\ndirected toward the poles along the meridian, but more weakly so in the\r\nmid-intervals; while near the poles one may discern a precipitate\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

For he\r\nreckoned that everywhere on the earth the point of variation on the Horizon\r\nis always distant nine degrees from the true north, toward the east: and\r\nfrom thence he forms, by a most foolish error, his demonstrative ratio of\r\nthe separate centres.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{170} CHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nOn the finding of the amount of variation: how great\r\n_is the arc of the Horizon from its arctick or antarctick_\r\nintersection of the meridian, to the point\r\n_respective of the magnetick needle_.\r\n\r\nVirtually the true meridian is the chief foundation of the whole matter:\r\nwhen that is accurately known, it will be easy by a mariners' compass (if\r\nits construction and the mode of attachment of the magnetick iron works are\r\nknown) or by some other larger horizontal versorium to exhibit the arc of\r\nvariation on the Horizon. By means of a sufficiently large nautical\r\nvariation compass (two equal altitudes of the sun being observed before and\r\nafter midday), the variation becomes known from the shadow; the altitude of\r\nthe sun is observed either by a staff or by a rather large quadrant.\r\n\r\nOn land the variation is found in another way which is easier, and because\r\nof the larger size of the instrument, more accurate. Let a thick squared\r\nboard be made of some suitable wood, the surface of which is two feet in\r\nlength and sixteen inches in width: describe upon it some semicircles as in\r\nthe following figure, only more in number. In the centre let a brass style\r\nbe reared perpendicularly: let there be also a movable pointer reaching\r\nfrom the centre to the outmost semicircle, and a magnetick versorium in a\r\ncavity covered over with glass: then let the board be exactly adjusted to\r\nthe level of the Horizon by the plane instrument with its perpendicular;\r\nand turn the lily of the instrument toward the north, so that the versorium\r\nmay rest truly over the middle line of the cavity, which looks toward the\r\npoint of variation on on the Horizon. Then at some convenient hour in the\r\nmorning (eight or nine for instance) observe the apex of the shadow thrown\r\nby the style when it reaches the nearest semicircle and mark the place of\r\nthe apex of this shadow with chalk or ink: then bring round the movable\r\nindex to that mark, and observe the degree on the Horizon numbered from the\r\nlily, which the index shows. In the afternoon see when the end of the\r\nshadow shall again reach the periphery of the same semicircle, and,\r\nbringing the index to the apex of the shadow, seek for the degree on the\r\nother side of the lily. From the difference of the degrees becomes known\r\n[Illustration] {172} the variation; the less being taken from the greater,\r\nhalf the remainder is the arc of variation. The variation is sought by many\r\nother instruments and methods in conjunction with a convenient mariners'\r\ncompass; also by a globe, by numbers, and by the ratios of triangles and\r\nsines, when the latitude is known and one observation is made of the sun's\r\naltitude: but those ways and methods are of less use, for it is superfluous\r\nto try to find in winding and roundabout ways what can be more readily and\r\nas accurately found in a shorter one. For the whole art is in the proper\r\nuse of the instruments by which the sun's place is expeditiously and\r\nquickly taken (since it does not remain stationary, but moves on): for\r\neither the hand trembles or the sight is dim, or the instrument makes an\r\nerror. Besides, to observe the altitude on both sides of the meridian is\r\njust as expeditious as to observe on one side only and at the same time to\r\nfind the elevation of the pole. And he who can take one altitude by the\r\ninstrument can also take another; but if the one altitude be uncertain,\r\nthen all the labour with the globe, numbers, sines and triangles is lost;\r\nnevertheless those exercises of ingenious mathematicians are to be\r\ncommended. It is easy for anyone, if he stand on land, to learn the\r\nvariation by accurate observations and suitable instruments, especially in\r\na nearly upright sphere; but on the sea, on account of the motion and the\r\nrestlessness of the waters, exact experiments in degrees and minutes cannot\r\nbe made: and with the usual instruments scarcely within the third or even\r\nthe halt of a rumbe, especially in a higher latitude; hence so many false\r\nand bad records of the observations of navigators. We have, however, taken\r\ncare for the finding of the deviation by a sufficiently convenient and\r\nready instrument, by means of the rising of certain stars, by the rising or\r\nsetting of the sun, and in northern regions by the Pole Star: for the\r\nvariation is learned with greater certainty even by the skilful with an\r\ninstrument which is at once simple and less sensitive to the waves of the\r\nsea. Its construction is as follows.\r\n\r\n[228]Let an instrument be made of the form of a true and meridional\r\nmariners' compass of at least one foot in diameter (with a versorium which\r\nis either nude or provided with a cardboard circle): let the limb be\r\ndivided into four quadrants, and each quadrant into 90 degrees. The movable\r\ncompass-box (as is usual in the nautical instrument) is to be balanced\r\nbelow by a heavy weight of sixteen pounds. On the margin of the suspended\r\ncompass-box, where opposite quadrants begin, let a half-ring rising in an\r\nangular frame in the middle be raised (with the feet of the half-ring fixed\r\non either side in holes in the margin) so that the top of the frame may be\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the compass; on its top let a rule sixteen\r\ndigits in length be fastened at its middle on a joint like a balance beam,\r\nso that it may move, as it were, about a central axis. At the ends of the\r\nrule there are small plates with holes, {173} [Illustration] {174} through\r\nwhich we can observe the sun or stars. The variation is best observed and\r\nexpeditiously by this instrument at the equinoxes by the rising or setting\r\nsun. But even when the sun is in other parts of the zodiack, the deviation\r\nbecomes known when we have the altitude of the pole: that being known, one\r\ncan learn the amplitude on the Horizon and the distance from the true east\r\nboth of the sun and of the following fixed stars by means of a globe, or\r\ntables, or an instrument. Then the variation readily becomes known by\r\ncounting from the true east the degrees and minutes of the amplitude at\r\nrising. Observe the preceding star of the three in the Belt of Orion as\r\nsoon as it appears on the horizon; direct the instrument toward it and\r\nobserve the versorium, for since the star has its rising in the true east\r\nabout one degree toward the south, it can be seen how much the versorium is\r\ndistant from the meridian, account being taken of that one degree. You will\r\nalso be able to observe the arctick pole star when it is on the meridian,\r\nor at its greatest distance from the meridian of about three degrees (the\r\npole star is distant 2 deg. 55 min. from the pole, according to the\r\nobservations of Tycho Brahe), and by the instrument you will learn the\r\nvariation (if the star be not on the meridian) by adding or subtracting,\r\n_secundum artem_, the proper reduction [_prostaphæresis_][229] of the\r\nstar's distance from the meridian. You will find when the pole star is on\r\nthe meridian by knowing the sun's place and the hour of the night: for this\r\na practised observer will easily perceive without great error by the\r\nvisible inclination of the constellation: for we do not take notice of a\r\nfew minutes, as do some who, when they toil to track the minutes of degrees\r\nat sea, are in error by a nearly whole rumbe. A practised observer will, in\r\nthe rising of sun or stars, allow something for refraction, so that he may\r\nbe able to use a more exact calculation.\r\n\r\nBright and conspicuous stars[230] which are\r\n_not far distant from the equator which it\r\nwill be useful to observe at their rising and\r\nsetting: the amplitude at the Horizon on\r\nrising being known from the altitude of the\r\npole and from the declination of the stars, by\r\nmeans of a globe, or tables, or an instrument\r\nwhence the variation is perceived by\r\ntechnical calculation._\r\n\r\n{175}\r\n\r\n                                 _Right Ascension_   _Declination_\r\n  |Oculus Tauri                 |     62°    55'   | 15°    53' N |\r\n  |Sinister humerus Orionis     |     72°    24'   |  4°     5' N |\r\n  |Dexter humerus Orionis       |     83°    30'   |  6°    19' N |\r\n  |Præcedens in cingulo Orionis |     77°    46'   |  1°    16' S |\r\n  |Canis major                  |     97°    10'   | 15°    55' S |\r\n  |Canis minor                  |    109°    41'   |  5°    55' N |\r\n  |Lucida Hydræ                 |    137°    10'   |  5°     3' S |\r\n  |Caput Geminorum australe     |    110°    21'   | 28°    30' N |\r\n  |Caput boreale                |    107°     4'   | 32°    10' N |\r\n  |Cor Leonis                   |    146°     8'   | 13°    47' N |\r\n  |Cauda Leonis                 |    171°    38'   | 16°    30' N |\r\n  |Spica Virginis               |    195°    44'   |  8°    34' S |\r\n  |Arcturus                     |     29°    13'   | 21°    54' N |\r\n  |Cor Aquilæ                   |    291°    56'   |  7°    35' N |\r\n\r\n_An instrument for finding the amplitude at rising on the horizon._\r\n\r\nDescribe the circumference of a circle and let it be divided into quadrants\r\nby two diameters intersecting each other at right angles at its centre.

This circle\r\nrepresents the plane of the meridian; its centre the actual point of east\r\nor west, _i.e._, the common intersection of the horizon and æquator; all\r\nthose lines æquidistant from the æquator denote the parallels of the sun\r\nand stars; the fiducial line of the rule or alhidade represents the\r\nhorizon; and its parts signify the degrees of the horizon, beginning from\r\nthe point of setting or of rising. {176}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTherefore if the fiducial line of the rule be applied to the given latitude\r\nof the place reckoned from either end of that diameter which represents the\r\naxis of the world; and if further the given declination of the sun or of\r\nsome star from the æquator (less than the complement of the latitude of the\r\nplace) be found on the limb of the instrument; then the intersection of the\r\nparallel drawn from that point of the declination with the horizon, or with\r\nthe fiducial line of the rule or alhidade, will indicate for the given\r\nlatitude of the place the amplitude at rising of the given star or the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{177} CHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\nThe observations of variation by seamen vary, for the\r\n_most part, and are uncertain: partly from error and inexperience_,\r\nand the imperfections of the instruments; and partly\r\n_from the sea being seldom so calm that the\r\nshadows or lights can remain quite\r\nsteady on the instruments_.\r\n\r\nAfter the variation of the compass had first been noticed, some more\r\ndiligent navigators took pains to investigate in various ways the\r\ndifference of aspect of the mariners' compass. Yet, to the great detriment\r\nof the nautical art, this has not been done so exactly as it ought to have\r\nbeen. For either being somewhat ignorant they have not understood any\r\naccurate method or they have used bad and absurd instruments, or else they\r\nmerely follow some conjecture arising from an ill-formed opinion as to some\r\nprime meridian or magnetick pole; whilst others again transcribe from\r\nothers, and parade these observations as their own; and they who, very\r\nunskilful themselves, first of all committed their observations to writing\r\nare, as by the prerogative of time, held in esteem by others, and their\r\nposterity does not think it safe to differ from them. Hence in long\r\nnavigations, especially to the East Indies, the records by the Portuguese\r\nof the deviating compass are seen to be unskilful: for whoever reads their\r\nwritings will easily understand that they are in error in very many things,\r\nand do not rightly understand the construction of the Portuguese compass\r\n(the lily of which diverges by half a rumbe from the needles toward the\r\nwest), nor its use in taking the variation. Hence, while they show the\r\nvariation of the compass in different places, it is uncertain whether they\r\nmeasure the deviation by a true meridional compass or by some other whose\r\nneedles are displaced from the lily. The Portuguese (as is patent in their\r\nwritings) make use of the Portuguese compass, whose magnetick needles are\r\nfixed aside from the lily by half of one rumbe toward the east. Moreover on\r\nthe sea the observation of the variation is a matter of great difficulty,\r\non account of the motion of the ship and the uncertainty of the deviation,\r\neven with the more skilful observers, if they use the best made instruments\r\nhitherto known and used. Hence there arise different opinions concerning\r\nthe magnetick deviation: as, for instance, near the Island of St. Helena\r\nthe Portuguese Rodriguez de {178} Lagos measures half a rumbe. The Dutch in\r\ntheir nautical log fix it at a whole rumbe. Kendall, the expert Englishman,\r\nwith a true meridional compass admits only a sixth part of a rumbe. A\r\nlittle to the East of Cape Agullias Diego Alfonso makes no variation, and\r\nshows by an Astrolabe that the compass remains in the true meridian.\r\nRodriguez shows that the compass at Cape Agulhas has no variation if it is\r\nof Portuguese construction, in which the needles are inclined half a rumbe\r\nto the East. And there is the same confusion, negligence, and vanity in\r\nvery many other instances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

But because\r\nthis rarely happens some variation is often observed under the æquator; and\r\neven at some distance from the æquator of three or 4 degrees toward the\r\nNorth, there may be a variation arising from the south, if those very wide\r\nand influential southern continents be somewhat near on one side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nThe variation of the magnetick needle in the great\r\nÆthiopick and American sea, beyond\r\n_the æquator_.\r\n\r\nDiscourse hath already been had of the mode and reason of the variation in\r\nthe great Atlantick Ocean: but when one has advanced beyond the æquator off\r\nthe east coast of Brazil the magnetick needle turns aside toward the\r\nmainland, namely, with that end of it which points to the south; so that\r\nwith that end of the versorium it deviates from the true meridian toward\r\nthe west; which navigators observe at the other end and suppose a variation\r\nto occur toward the east. But throughout the whole way from the first\r\npromontory on the east of Brazil, by {179} Cape St. Augustine and thence to\r\nCape Frio, and further still to the mouth of the Strait of Magellan, the\r\nvariation is always from the south toward the west with that end of the\r\nversorium which tends toward the antarctick pole. For it is always with the\r\naccordant end that it turns toward a continent. The variation, however,\r\noccurs not only on the coast itself, but at some distance from land, such\r\nas a space of fifty or sixty German miles or even more. But when at length\r\none has progressed far from land, then the arc begins to diminish: for the\r\nmagnetick needle turns aside the less toward what is too far off, and is\r\nturned aside the less from what is present and at hand, since it enjoys\r\nwhat is present. In the Island of St. Helena (the longitude of which is\r\nless than is commonly marked on charts and globes) the versorium varies by\r\none degree or nearly two. The Portuguese and others taught by them, who\r\nnavigate beyond the Cape of Good Hope to the Indies, set a course toward\r\nthe Islands of Tristan d'Acunha, in order that they may enjoy more\r\nfavourable winds; in the former part of their course the change of\r\nvariation is not great; but after they have approached the islands the\r\nvariation increases; and close to the islands it is greater than anywhere\r\nelse in the whole course. For the end of the versorium tending to the south\r\n(in which lies the greatest source of the variation) is caught and allured\r\ntoward the south-west by the great promontory of the southern land. But\r\nwhen they proceed onward toward the Cape of Good Hope the variation\r\ndiminishes the more they approach it. But on the prime meridian in the\r\nlatitude of 45 degrees, the versorium tends to the south-east: and one who\r\nnavigates near the coast from Manicongo to the tropick, and a little\r\nbeyond, will perceive that the versorium tends from the south to the east,\r\nalthough not much. At the promontory of Agulhas it preserves slightly the\r\nvariation which it showed near the islands of d'Acunha, which nevertheless\r\nis very much diminished because of the greater remoteness from the cause of\r\nvariation, and consequently there the southern end of the versorium does\r\nnot yet face exactly to the pole.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\nOn the variation in Nova Zembla.\r\n\r\nVariations in parts near the pole are greater (as has been shown before)\r\nand also have sudden changes, as in former years the Dutch explorers\r\nobserved not badly, even if those observations were not exact--which indeed\r\nis pardonable in them; for with the usual instruments it is with difficulty\r\n{180} that the truth becomes known in such a high latitude (of about 80\r\ndegrees). Now, however, from the deviation of the compass the reason for\r\nthere being an open course to the east by the Arctick Ocean appears\r\nmanifest; for since the versorium has so ample a variation toward the\r\nnorth-west, it is demonstrable that a continent does not extend any great\r\ndistance in the whole of that course toward the east. Therefore with the\r\ngreater hope can the sea be attempted and explored toward the east for a\r\npassage to the Moluccas by the north-east than by the north-west.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

And a similar\r\ndeflection would be continued along the whole coast of Peru as far as the\r\næquator. In a higher latitude up to 45 deg. the variation is greater than\r\nnear the æquator; and the deflection toward the south-east is in nearly the\r\nsame proportion as was the deviation from the south toward the west on the\r\neastern shore of South America. From the æquator toward the North there is\r\nlittle or no variation until one comes to New Galicia; and thence along the\r\nwhole shore as far as Quivira the inclination is from the north toward the\r\neast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\nOn the variation in the Mediterranean Sea.\r\n\r\nSicilian and Italian sailors think that in the Sicilian Sea and toward the\r\neast up to the meridian of the Peloponnesus (as Franciscus Maurolycus\r\nrelates) the magnetick needle \"græcizes,\" that is, turns from the pole\r\ntoward what is called the greek wind or Boreas; that on the shore of the\r\nPeloponnesus it looks toward the true pole; but that when they have\r\nproceeded further east, then it \"mistralizes,\" because it tends from the\r\npole toward the mistral or north-west wind: which agrees with our rule for\r\nthe variation. For as the Mediterranean Sea is extended toward the west\r\nfrom that meridian, so on the side {181} toward the east the Mediterranean\r\nSea lies open as far as Palestine; as toward North and East lie open the\r\nwhole Archipelago and the neighbouring Black Sea. From the Peloponnesus\r\ntoward the north pole the meridian passes through the largest and most\r\nelevated regions of all Europe; through Achaia, Macedonia, Hungary,\r\nTransylvania, Lithuania, Novogardia, Corelia and Biarmia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

On continents,\r\nalso, the magnetick needle often deviates from the meridian, as on the edge\r\nof the land and near the borders; but it is generally accustomed to deviate\r\nby a somewhat small arc. In the middle, however, of great regions there are\r\nno variations. Hence in the middle lands of Upper Europe, in the interior\r\nof Asia, and in the heart of Africa, of Peru, and in the regions of North\r\nor Mexican America, the versorium rests in the meridian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\nVariation in the Eastern Ocean.\r\n\r\nVariation in the Eastern Ocean throughout the whole voyage to Goa and the\r\nMoluccas is observed by the Portuguese; but they err greatly in many\r\nthings, following, as they do, the first observers who note down variations\r\nin certain places with ill-adapted instruments, and by no means accurate\r\nobservations, or by some conjectures. As, for instance, in Brandöe Island,\r\nthey make the versorium deviate by 22 degrees to the north-west. For in no\r\nregion or place in the whole world, of not greater latitude, is there so\r\ngreat a deviation; and, in reality, there the deviation is slight. Also\r\nwhen they make out that at Mosambique the compass deviates by one rumbe to\r\nthe north-west, it is false; even though they use (as they are accustomed\r\nto do) the Portuguese compass: for beyond all doubt on the shore of {182}\r\nMosambique the versorium inclines ¼ rumbe or even more to the south-west.\r\nVery wrongly also beyond the æquator in the course to Goa they make the\r\nlittle compass incline by 1½ rumbe to the west: whereas they should rather\r\nhave said that in the first part of the course the Portuguese compass\r\ninclines by 1 rumbe: but that the true meridional compass inclines by ½\r\nrumbe only. In order that the amount of variation in the Eastern Ocean may\r\nbe accurately settled in most places by our rules, there is needed a more\r\nexact and truer survey of the southern land, which spreads out from the\r\nsouth to the æquinoctial more than is commonly described on maps and\r\nglobes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nHow the deviation of the versorium is augmented and\r\n_diminished by reason of the distance of places_.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of great and continent lands there is no variation. Nor,\r\ngenerally, in the middle of very great seas. On the margin of those lands\r\nand seas the variation is often ample, yet not so great as at a little\r\nfurther distance on the sea. As, for example, near Cape St. Augustine the\r\ncompass varies; but at 50 miles from land toward the East it varies more;\r\nand 80 miles off it varies still more; and yet still more at a distance of\r\n100 miles. But from a distance of 100 miles the diminutions of deviation\r\nare slower, when they are navigating toward the mainland, than at a\r\ndistance of 80 miles, and at a distance of 80 miles than at 50: for the\r\ndeviations change and are diminished rather more swiftly the more they\r\napproach and draw near land than when at a great distance off. As, for\r\ninstance, navigating toward Newfoundland the change of variation is more\r\nrapid (that is, it decreases a degree in a smaller arc of the course on the\r\nparallel) when they are not far from land than when they are a hundred\r\nmiles distant: but when travelling on land toward the interiors of regions\r\nthe changes are slower in the first parts of the journey than when they\r\ncome more into the interior.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the arcs on a parallel circle, when a versorium is moved\r\ntoward continents which extend to the pole, corresponds with the degrees of\r\nvariation. Let A be the pole; B the eminences of the dominant lands; at C\r\nthere is no variation caused by B, for it is too far away; at D the\r\nvariation is very great because the versorium is allured or turned by the\r\nwhole earth toward the eminent {183} land B; and moreover it is not\r\nhindered, or restrained or brought back to the pole by the verticity of the\r\nearth; but, tending of its own nature to the pole, it is nevertheless\r\ndeflected from it by reason of the site, or position, and convenient\r\ndistance of the dominant and high lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow from C toward D the variation increases; the versorium, however, does\r\nnot deviate so rapidly in the first spaces as near D: for more miles are\r\ntraversed on the parallel circle C D, near C, in order that the versorium\r\nmay deviate by one degree from the pole A, than near D. So also in order\r\nthat the variation may be diminished from D toward E more miles are\r\nrequired near D than near E. Thus the deviations become equal in unequal\r\ncourses, whether the variation be increasing or decreasing; and yet the\r\nvariation decreases by lesser intervals than it increases. There intervene,\r\nhowever, many other causes which perturb this proportion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{184} [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBOOK FIFTH.\r\n\r\n_CHAP. I._\r\n\r\nON DECLINATION.\r\n\r\nIn due course we have now come to that notable experiment, and remarkable\r\nmotion of magnetick bodies dipping below the horizon by their own rotatory\r\nnature; by the knowledge of which is revealed a unity, a concordancy, and a\r\nmutual agreement between the terrestrial globe and the loadstone (or the\r\nmagnetick iron), which is wonderful in itself, and is made manifest by our\r\nteaching. This motion we have made known in many striking experiments, and\r\nhave established its rules; and in the following pages we shall demonstrate\r\nthe causes of it, in such a way that no sound, logical mind can ever\r\nrightly set at nought or disprove our chief magnetick principles.\r\nDirection, as also variation, is demonstrated in a horizontal plane, when a\r\nbalanced magnetick needle comes to rest at some definite point; but\r\ndeclination is seen to be the motion of a needle, starting from that point\r\nof the horizon, first balanced on its own axis, then excited by a\r\nloadstone, one end or pole of it tending toward the centre of the earth.\r\nAnd we have found that it takes place in proportion to the latitude of each\r\nregion. But that motion arises in truth, not from any motion from the\r\nhorizon toward the centre of the earth, but from the turning of the whole\r\nmagnetick body toward the whole of the earth, as we shall show hereafter.\r\nNor does the iron dip from the horizontal in some oblique sphere, according\r\nto the number of degrees of elevation of the pole in the given region, or\r\nby an equal arc in the quadrant, as will appear hereafter. {185}\r\n\r\nInstrument of the Declination\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{186} Now how much it dips at every horizon may be ascertained in the first\r\nplace by a contrivance, which, however, is not so easily made as is that in\r\ndials for measuring time, in which the needle turns to the points of the\r\nhorizon, or in the mariners' compass. From a plank of wood let a smooth and\r\ncircular instrument be prepared, at least six digits in diameter, and affix\r\nthis to the side of a square pillar, which stands upright on a wooden base.\r\nDivide the periphery of this instrument into 4 quadrants: then each\r\nquadrant into 90 degrees. At the centre of the instrument let there be\r\nplaced a brass peg, at the centre of the end of which let there be a small\r\nhollow, well polished. To this wooden instrument let a brass circle or ring\r\nbe fixed, about two digits in width, with a thin plate or flat rod of the\r\nsame metal, representing the horizon, fixed across it, through the middle\r\nof the circle. In the middle of the horizontal rod let there be another\r\nhollow, which shall be exactly opposite the centre of the instrument, where\r\nthe former hollow was made. Afterward let a needle be fashioned out of\r\nsteel, as versoria are accustomed to be made. Divide this at right angles\r\nby a thin iron axis (like a cross) through the very middle and centre of\r\nthe wire and the cross-piece. Let this dipping-needle be hung (with the\r\nends of the cross resting in the aforesaid holes) so that it can move\r\nfreely and evenly on its axis in the most perfect æquilibrium, so\r\naccurately that it turns away from no one point or degree marked on the\r\ncircumference more than from another, but that it can rest quite easily at\r\nany. Let it be fixed upright to the front part of the pillar, whilst at the\r\nedge of the base is a small versorium to show direction. Afterward touch\r\nthe iron, suspended by this ingenious method, on both ends with the\r\nopposite ends of a loadstone, according to the scientifick method, but\r\nrather carefully, lest the needle be twisted in any way; for unless you\r\nprepare everything very skilfully and cleverly, you will secure no result.\r\nThen let another brass ring be prepared, a little larger, so as to contain\r\nthe former one; and let a glass or a very thin plate of mica be fitted to\r\none side of it. When this is put over the former ring, the whole space\r\nwithin remains inclosed, and the versorium is not interfered with by dust\r\nor winds. Dispose the instrument, thus completed, perpendicularly on its\r\nbase, and with the small versorium horizontal, in such a way that, while\r\nstanding perpendicularly, it may be directed toward the exact magnetical\r\npoint respective. Then the end of the needle which looks toward the north\r\ndips below the horizon in northern regions, whilst in southern regions the\r\nend of the needle which looks toward the south tends toward the centre of\r\nthe earth, in a certain proportion (to be explained afterward) to the\r\nlatitude of the district in question, from the æquator on either side. The\r\nneedle, however, must be rubbed on {187} a powerful loadstone; otherwise it\r\ndoes not dip to the true point, or else it goes past it, and does not\r\nalways rest in it. A larger instrument may also be used, whose diameter may\r\nbe 10 or 12 digits; but in such an instrument more care is needed to\r\nbalance the versorium truly. Care must be taken that the needle be of\r\nsteel; also that it be straight; likewise that both ends of the cross-piece\r\nbe sharp and fixed at right angles to the needle, and that the cross-piece\r\npass through the centre of the needle. As in other magnetical motions there\r\nis an exact agreement between the earth and the stone, and a correspondence\r\nmanifestly apparent to our senses by means of our experiments; so in this\r\ndeclination there is a clear and evident concordance of the terrestrial\r\nglobe with the loadstone. Of this motion, so important and so long unknown\r\nto all men, the following is the sure and true cause. A magnet-stone is\r\nmoved and turned round until one of its poles being impelled toward the\r\nnorth comes to rest toward a definite point of the horizon. [231]This pole,\r\nwhich settles toward the north (as appears from the preceding rules and\r\ndemonstrations), is the southern, not the boreal; though all before us\r\ndeemed it to be the boreal, on account of its turning to that point of the\r\nhorizon. A wire or versorium touched on this pole of the stone turns to the\r\nsouth, and is made into a boreal pole, because it was touched by the\r\nsouthern terminal of the stone. So if the cusp of a versorium be excited in\r\na similar manner, it will be directed toward the southern pole of the\r\nearth, and will adjust itself also to it; but the cross (the other end)\r\nwill be southern, and will turn to the north of the earth (the earth itself\r\nbeing the cause of its motion); for so direction is produced from the\r\ndisposition of the stone or of the excited iron, and from the verticity of\r\nthe earth. But declination takes place when a magnetick is turned round\r\ntoward the body of the earth, with its southern end toward the north, at\r\nsome latitude away from the æquator. For this is certain and constant, that\r\nexactly under the coelestial æquator, or rather over the æquator of the\r\nterrestrial globe, there is no declination of a loadstone or of iron; but\r\nin whatever way the iron has been excited or rubbed, it settles in the\r\ndeclination instrument precisely along the plane of the horizon, if it were\r\nproperly balanced before. Now this occurs thus because, when the magnetick\r\nbody is at an equal distance from either pole, it dips toward neither by\r\nits own versatory nature, but remains evenly directed to the level of the\r\nhorizon, as if it were resting on a pin or floating free and unhindered on\r\nwater. But when the magnetick substance is at some latitude away from the\r\næquator, or when either pole of the earth is raised (I do not say raised\r\nabove the visible horizon, as the commonly imagined pole of the revolving\r\nuniverse in the sky, but above the horizon or its centre, or its proper\r\ndiameter, æquidistant from the plane of the visible horizon, which is the\r\ntrue elevation of the terrestrial pole), {188} [Illustration] then\r\ndeclination is apparent, and the iron inclines toward the body of the earth\r\nin its own meridian. Let A B, for example, be the visible horizon of a\r\nplace; C D the horizontal through the earth, dividing it into equal parts;\r\nE F the axis of the earth; G the position of the place. It is manifest that\r\nthe boreal pole E is elevated above the point C by as much as G is distant\r\nfrom the æquator. Wherefore, since at E the magnetick needle stands\r\nperpendicularly in its proper turning (as we have often shown before), so\r\nnow at G there is a certain tendency to turn in proportion to the latitude\r\n(the magnetick dipping below the plane of the horizon), and the magnetick\r\nbody intersects the horizon at unequal angles, and exhibits a declination\r\nbelow the horizon. For the same reason, if the declinatory needle be placed\r\nat G, its southern end, the one namely which is directed toward the North,\r\ndips below the plane of the visible horizon A B. And so there is the\r\ngreatest difference between a right sphere[232] and a polar or parallel\r\nsphere, in which the pole is at the very Zenith. For in a right sphere the\r\nneedle is parallel to the plane of the horizon; but when the coelestial\r\npole is vertically overhead, or when the pole of the earth is itself the\r\nplace of the region, then the needle is perpendicular to the horizon. This\r\nis shown by a round stone. Let a small dipping-needle, of two digits length\r\n(rubbed with a magnet), be hung in the air like a balance, and let the\r\nstone be carefully placed under it; and first let the terrella be at right\r\nangles, as in a right sphere, and as in the first figure; for so the\r\nmagnetick needle will remain in equilibrium. But in an oblique position of\r\nthe terrella, as in an oblique sphere, and in the second figure, the needle\r\ndips obliquely at one end toward the near pole, but does not rest on the\r\npole, nor is its dip ruled by the pole, but by the body and mass of the\r\nwhole; for the {189} dip in higher latitudes passes beyond the pole. But in\r\nthe third position of the terrella the needle is perpendicular; because the\r\npole of the stone is placed at the top, and the needle tending straight\r\ntoward the body reaches to the pole. The cross in the preceding figures\r\nalways turns toward the boreal pole of the terrella, having been touched by\r\nthe boreal pole of the terrella; the cusp of the needle, having been\r\ntouched by the southern pole of the stone, turns to the south. Thus one may\r\nsee on a terrella the level, oblique, and perpendicular positions of a\r\nmagnetick needle. *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

In the diagram before us all the cusps have been touched by\r\nthe true Arctick pole of the terrella.\r\n\r\nHere we have the level position of the magnetick needle on the æquator of\r\nthe earth and the stone, at A and B, and its perpendicular position at C,\r\nD, the poles; whilst at the places midway between, at a distance of 45\r\ndegrees, the crosses of the needle dip toward the south, but the cusps just\r\nas much toward the north. Of which thing the reason will become clear from\r\nthe demonstrations that follow.\r\n\r\n_* Diagram of the rotation and declination of a terrella_\r\nconforming to the globe of the earth, for a\r\n_latitude of 50 degrees north._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA is the boreal pole of the earth or of a rather large terrella, B the\r\nsouthern, C a smaller terrella, E the southern pole of the smaller\r\nterrella, dipping in the northern regions[233]. The centre C is placed on\r\nthe surface of the larger terrella, because the smaller terrella shows some\r\nvariation on account of the length of the axis; inappreciable, however, on\r\nthe earth. Just as a magnetick needle dips in a regional latitude of 50\r\ndegrees, so also the axis of a stone (of a spherical stone, of course) is\r\ndepressed below the horizon, and its natural austral pole falls, and its\r\nboreal pole is raised on the {191} south toward the Zenith. In the same way\r\nalso a circular disc of iron behaves, which has been carefully touched at\r\nopposite parts on its circumference; but the magnetical experiments are\r\nless clear on account of the feebler forces in round pieces of iron.\r\n\r\n_Variety in the declinations of iron spikes at various latitudes of a\r\nterrella._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe declination of a magnetick needle above a terrella is shown by means of\r\nseveral equal iron wires, of the length of a barleycorn, arranged along a\r\nmeridian. The wires on the æquator are directed by the virtue of the stone\r\ntoward the poles, and lie down upon its body along the plane of its\r\nhorizon. The nearer they are brought to the poles, the more they are raised\r\nup by their versatory nature. At the poles themselves they point\r\nperpendicularly toward the very centre. But iron spikes, if they are of\r\nmore than a due length, are not raised straight up except on a vigorous\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nAn indicatory instrument, showing by the virtue of a\r\n_stone the degrees of declination from the horizon_\r\nof each several latitude.\r\n\r\n{192} [Illustration] {193} _Description of the Instrument, and its use._\r\n\r\nTake a terrella of the best strong loadstone, and homogeneous throughout,\r\nnot weakened by decay or by a flaw in any parts; let it be of a fair size,\r\nso that its diameter is six or seven digits; and let it be made exactly\r\nspherical. Having found its poles according to the method already shown,\r\nmark them with an iron tool; then mark also the æquinoctial circle.\r\nAfterwards in a thick squared block of wood, one foot in size, make a\r\nhemispherical hollow, which shall hold half of the terrella, and such that\r\nexactly one half of the stone shall project above the face of the block.\r\nDivide the limb close to this cavity (a circle having been drawn round it\r\nfor a meridian) into 4 quadrants, and each of these into 90 degrees. Let\r\nthe terminus of the quadrants on the limb be near the centre of a quadrant\r\ndescribed on the block, also divided into 90 degrees. At that centre let a\r\nshort, slender versorium (its other end being rather sharp and elongated\r\nlike a pointer) be placed in æquilibrio on a suitable pin. It is manifest\r\nthat when the poles of the stone are at the starting points of the\r\nquadrants, then the versorium lies straight, as if in æquilibrio, over the\r\nterrella. But if you move the terrella, so that the pole on the left hand\r\nrises, then the versorium rises on the meridian in proportion to the\r\nlatitude, and turns itself as a magnetick body; and on the quadrant\r\ndescribed on the flat surface of the wood, the degree of its turning or of\r\nthe declination is shown by the versorium. The rim of the cavity represents\r\na meridional circle, to which corresponds some meridian circle of the\r\nterrella, since the poles on both sides are within the circumference of the\r\nrim itself. These things clearly always happen on the same plan on the\r\nearth itself when there is no variation; but when there is variation,\r\neither in the direction or in the declination (a disturbance, as it were,\r\nin the true turning, on account of causes to be explained later), then\r\nthere is some difference. Let the quadrant be near the limb, or have its\r\ncentre on the limb itself, and let the versorium be very short, so as not\r\nto touch the terrella, because with a versorium that is longer or more\r\nremote, there is some error; for it has a motion truly proportionate to the\r\nterrella only on the surface of the terrella. But if the quadrant, being\r\nfar distant from the terrella, were moved within the orbe of virtue of the\r\nterrella toward the pole on some circle concentrick with the terrella, then\r\nthe versorium would indicate the degrees of declination on the quadrant, in\r\nproportion to and symmetrically with that circle, not with the terrella.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{194} CHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\nConcerning the length of a versorium convenient\r\n_for declination on a terrella_.\r\n\r\nDeclination being investigated on the earth itself by means of a\r\ndeclination instrument, we may use either a short or a very long versorium,\r\nif only the magnetick virtue of the stone that touches it is able to\r\npermeate through the whole of its middle and through all its length. For\r\nthe greatest length of a versorium has no moment or perceptible proportion\r\nto the earth's semi-diameter. On a terrella, however, or in a plane near a\r\nmeridian of a terrella, a short versorium is desirable, of the length, say,\r\nof a barleycorn; for longer ones (because they reach further) dip and turn\r\ntoward the body of the terrella suddenly and irregularly in the first\r\ndegrees of declination. [Illustration] For example, as soon as the long\r\nversorium is moved forward from the aequator A to C, it catches on the\r\nstone with its cusp (as if with a long extended wing), when the cusp\r\nreaches to the parts about B, which produce a greater rotation than at C.\r\nAnd the extremities of longer wires also and rods turn irregularly, just as\r\niron wires and balls of iron and other orbicular loadstones are likewise\r\nturned about irregularly by a long non-orbicular loadstone. Just so\r\nmagneticks or iron bodies on the surface of a terrella ought not to have\r\ntoo long an axis, but a very short one; so that they may make a declination\r\non the terrella truly and naturally proportionate to that on the earth. A\r\nlong versorium also close to a terrella with difficulty stands steady in a\r\nhorizontal direction on a right sphere, and, beginning to waver, it dips\r\nimmediately to one side, especially the end that was touched, or (if both\r\nwere touched) the one which felt the stone last.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{195} CHAP. V.\r\n\r\nThat declination does not arise from the attraction\r\nof the loadstone, but from a disposing and\r\n_rotating influence_.\r\n\r\nIn the universe of nature that marvellous provision of its Maker should be\r\nnoticed, whereby the principal bodies are restrained within certain\r\nhabitations and fenced in, as it were (nature controlling them). For this\r\nreason the stars, though they move and advance, are not thrown into\r\nconfusion. Magnetical rotations also arise from a disposing influence,\r\nwhether in greater and dominating quantity, or in a smaller, and compliant\r\nquantity, even though it be very small. For the work is not accomplished by\r\nattraction, but by an incitation of each substance, by a motion of\r\nagreement toward fixed bounds, beyond which no advance is made. For if the\r\nversorium dipped by reason of an attractive force, then a terrella made\r\nfrom a very strong magnetick stone would cause the versorium to turn toward\r\nitself more than one made out of an average stone, and a piece of iron\r\ntouched with a vigorous loadstone would dip more. This, however, never\r\nhappens. Moreover, an iron snout placed on a meridian in any latitude does\r\nnot raise a spike more toward the perpendicular than the stone itself,\r\nalone and unarmed; although when thus equipped, it plucks up and raises\r\nmany greater weights[234]. But if a loadstone be sharper toward one pole,\r\ntoward the other blunter, the sharp end or pole allures a magnetick needle\r\nmore strongly, the blunt, thick end makes it rotate more strongly; but an\r\norbicular stone * makes it rotate strongly and truly, in accordance with\r\nmagnetick rules and its globular form. A long stone, on the other hand,\r\nextended from pole to pole, moves a versorium toward it irregularly; for in\r\nthis case the pole of the versorium always looks down on the pole itself.\r\nSimilarly also, if the loadstone have been made in the shape of a circle,\r\nand its poles are on the circumference, whilst the body of it is plane, not\r\nglobular, if the plane be brought near a versorium, the versorium does not\r\nmove with the regular magnetick rotation, as on a terrella; but it turns\r\nlooking always toward the pole of the loadstone, which has its seat on the\r\ncircumference of the plane. Moreover, if the stone caused the versorium to\r\nrotate by attracting it, then in the first degrees of latitude, it would\r\nattract the end of a short versorium toward the body itself of the\r\nterrella; yet it does not so attract it that they are brought into contact\r\nand unite; but the versorium rotates just so far as nature demands, as is\r\nclear from this example. {196} [Illustration] * For the cusp of a versorium\r\nplaced in a low latitude does not touch the stone or unite with it, but\r\nonly inclines toward it. Moreover, when a magnetick body rotates in\r\ndipping, the pole of the versorium is not stayed or detained by the pole of\r\nthe earth or terrella; but it rotates regularly, and does not stop at any\r\npoint or bound, nor point straight to the pole toward which the centre of\r\nthe versorium is advancing, unless on the pole itself, and once only\r\nbetween the pole and the æquator; but it dips as it advances, according as\r\nthe change of position of its centre gives a reason for its inclination in\r\naccordance with rules magnetical. The declination of a magnetick needle in\r\nwater also, as demonstrated in the following pages, is a fixed\r\nquantity[235]; the magnetick needle does not descend to the bottom of the\r\nvessel, but remains steady in the middle, rotated on its centre according\r\nto its due amount of declination. This would not happen, if the earth or\r\nits poles by their attraction drew down the end of the magnetick needle, so\r\nthat it dipped in this way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nOn the proportion of declination to latitude[236], and\r\n_the cause of it_.\r\n\r\nConcerning the making of an instrument for finding declination, the causes\r\nand manner of declination, and the different degrees of rotation in\r\ndifferent places, the inclination of the stone, and concerning an\r\ninstrument indicating by the influence of a stone the degree of declination\r\nfrom any horizon we have already spoken. Then we spoke about needles on the\r\nmeridian of a stone, and their rotation shown for various latitudes by\r\ntheir rise toward the perpendicular. We must now, however, treat more fully\r\nof the causes of the degree of that inclination. Whilst a loadstone and a\r\nmagnetick iron wire are moved along a meridian from the aequator toward the\r\npole, they rotate toward a round loadstone, as also toward the earth with a\r\ncircular movement. On a right horizon (just as also on the æquinoctial of\r\n{197} the stone) the axis of the iron, which is its centre line, is a line\r\nparallel to the axis of the earth. When that axis reaches the pole, which\r\nis the centre of the axis, it stands in the same straight line with the\r\naxis of the earth. The same end of the iron which at the æquator looks\r\nsouth turns to the north. For it is not a motion of centre to centre, but a\r\nnatural turning of a magnetick body to a magnetick body, and of the axis of\r\nthe body to the axis; it is not in consequence of the attraction of the\r\npole itself that the iron points to the earth's polar point. Under the\r\næquator the magnetick needle remains in æquilibrio horizontally; but toward\r\nthe pole on either side, in every latitude from the beginning of the first\r\ndegree right up to the ninetieth, it dips. The magnetick needle does not,\r\nhowever, in proportion to any number of degrees or any arc of latitude fall\r\nbelow the horizon just that number of degrees or a similar arc, but a very\r\ndifferent one: because this motion is not really a motion of declination,\r\nbut is in [Illustration] reality a motion of rotation, and it observes an\r\narc of rotation according to the arc of latitude. Therefore a magnetick\r\nbody A, while it is advancing over the earth itself, or a little earth or\r\nterrella, from the æquinoctial G toward the pole B, rotates on its own\r\ncentre, and halfway on the progress of its centre[237] from the æquator to\r\nthe pole B it is pointing toward the æquator at F, midway between the two\r\npoles. Much more quickly, therefore, must the versorium rotate than its\r\ncentre advances, in order that by rotating it may face straight toward the\r\npoint F. Wherefore the motion of this rotation is rapid in the first\r\ndegrees from the æquator, namely, from A to L; but more tardy in the later\r\ndegrees from L to B, when facing from the æquator at F to C. But if the\r\ndeclination were equal to the latitude (_i.e._, always just as many degrees\r\nfrom the horizon, as the centre of the versorium has receded from the\r\næquator), then the magnetick needle would be following some potency and\r\npeculiar virtue of the centre, as if it {198} were a point operating by\r\nitself. But it pays regard to the whole, both its mass, and its outer\r\nlimits; the forces of both uniting, as well of the magnetick versorium as\r\nof the earth. *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the diagram of the rotation of\r\n_a magnetick needle_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuppose A C D L to be the body of the earth or of a terrella, its centre M,\r\nÆquator A D, Axis C L, A B the Horizon, which changes according to the\r\nplace. From the point F on a Horizon distant from the æquator A by the\r\nlength of C M, the semi-diameter of the earth or terrella, an arc is\r\ndescribed to H as the limit of the quadrants of declination; for {199} all\r\nthe quadrants of declination serving the parts from A to C begin from that\r\narc, and terminate at M, the centre of the earth. The semi-diameter of this\r\narc is a chord drawn from the æquator A to the pole C; and a line produced\r\nalong the horizon from A to B, equal to that chord, gives the beginning of\r\nthe arc of the limits of arcs of rotation and revolution, which is\r\ncontinued as far as G. For just as a quadrant of a circle about the centre\r\nof the earth (whose beginning is on the horizon, at a distance from the\r\næquator equal to the earth's semi-diameter) is the limit of all quadrants\r\nof declination drawn from each several horizon to the centre; so a circle\r\nabout the centre from B, the beginning of the first arc of rotation, to G\r\nis the limit of the arcs of rotation. The arcs of rotation and revolution\r\nof the magnetick needle are intermediate between the arcs of rotation B L\r\nand G L. The centre of the arc is the region itself or place in which the\r\nobservation is being made; the beginning of the arc is taken from the\r\ncircle which is the limit of rotations, and it stops at the opposite pole;\r\nas, for example, from O to L, in a latitude of 45 degrees. Let any arc of\r\nrotation be divided into 90 equal parts from the limit of the arcs of\r\nrotation toward the pole; for whatever is the degree of latitude of the\r\nplace, the part of the arc of rotation which the magnetick pole on or near\r\nthe terrella or the earth faces in its rotation is to be numbered similarly\r\nto this. The straight lines in the following larger diagram show this. The\r\nmagnetick rotation at the middle point in a latitude of 45 degrees is\r\ndirected toward the æquator, in which case also that arc is a quadrant of a\r\ncircle from the limit to the pole; but previous to this all the arcs of\r\nrotation are greater than a quadrant, whilst after it they are smaller; in\r\nthe former the needle rotates more quickly, but in the succeeding positions\r\ngradually more slowly. For each several region there is a special arc of\r\nrotation, in which the limit to which the needle rotates is according to\r\nthe number of degrees of latitude of the place in question; so that a\r\nstraight line drawn from the place to the point on that arc marked with the\r\nnumber of degrees of latitude shows the magnetick direction, and indicates\r\nthe degree of declination at the intersection of the quadrant of\r\ndeclination which serves the given place. Take away the arc of the quadrant\r\nof declination drawn from the centre to the line of direction; that which\r\nis left is the arc of declination below the horizon. As, for example, in\r\nthe rotation of the versorium N, whose line respective proceeds to D, from\r\nthe quadrant of declination, S M, take away its arc R M; that which is left\r\nis the arc of declination: how much, that is, the needle dips in the\r\nlatitude of 45 degrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{200} CHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nDiagram of the rotation of a magnetick needle,\r\n_indicating magnetical declination in all latitudes, and_\r\nfrom the rotation and declination, the\r\n_latitude itself_.\r\n\r\nIn the more elaborate diagram a circle of rotations and a circle of\r\ndeclinations are adjusted to the body of the earth or terrella, with a\r\nfirst, a last, and a middle arc of rotation and declination. Now from each\r\nfifth division of the arc which limits all the arcs of rotation (and which\r\nare understood[238] as divided into 90 equal parts) arcs are drawn to the\r\npole, and from every fifth degree of the arc limiting the quadrants of\r\ndeclination, quadrants are drawn to the centre; and at the same time a\r\nspiral line is drawn, indicating (by the help of a movable quadrant) the\r\ndeclination in every latitude. Straight lines showing the direction of the\r\nneedle are drawn from those degrees which are marked on the meridian of the\r\nearth or a terrella to their proper arcs and the corresponding points on\r\nthose arcs.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the elevation of the pole or the latitude of a place\r\nanywhere\r\n_in the world, by means of the following diagram, turned into\r\na magnetick instrument, without the help of the coelestial\r\nbodies, sun, planets, or fixed stars, in fog\r\nand darkness_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe may see how far from unproductive magnetick philosophy is, how\r\nagreeable, how helpful, how divine! Sailors when tossed about on the waves\r\nwith continuous cloudy weather, and unable by means of the coelestial\r\nluminaries to learn anything about the place or the region in which they\r\nare, with a very slight effort and with a small instrument are comforted,\r\nand learn the latitude of the place. With a declination instrument the\r\ndegree of declination of the magnetick needle below the horizon is\r\nobserved; that degree is noted on the inner arc of the quadrant, and the\r\nquadrant is turned round about the centre of the instrument until that\r\ndegree on the quadrant touches the spiral line; then in the open space B at\r\nthe centre of the quadrant the latitude of the region on {201} the\r\ncircumference of the globe is discerned by means of the fiducial line A B.\r\nLet the diagram be fixed on a suitable flat board, and let the centre of\r\nthe corner A of the quadrant be fastened to the centre of it, so that the\r\nquadrant may rotate on that centre. But it must be understood that there is\r\nalso in certain places a variation in the declination on account of causes\r\nalready mentioned (though not a large one), which it will be an assistance\r\nalso to allow for on a likely estimate; and it will be especially helpful\r\nto observe this variation in various places, as it seems to present greater\r\ndifficulty than the variation in direction; but it is easily learnt with a\r\ndeclination instrument, when it dips more or less than the line in the\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_To observe magnetick declination at sea_.\r\n\r\nSet upon our variation instrument a declination instrument; a wooden disc\r\nbeing placed between the round movable {202} compass and the declination\r\ninstrument: but first remove the versorium, lest the versorium should\r\ninterfere with the dipping needle. In this way (though the sea be rough)\r\nthe compass box will remain upright at the level of the horizon. The stand\r\nof the declination instrument must be directed by means of the small\r\nversorium at its base, which is set to the point respective of the\r\nvariation, on the great circle of which (commonly called the magnetick\r\nmeridian), the plane of the upright box is arranged; thus the declinatorium\r\n(by its versatory nature) indicates the degree of declination.\r\n\r\nIn a declination instrument the magnetick needle, which\r\n_in a meridional position dips, if turned\r\nalong a parallel hangs perpendicularly._\r\n\r\nIn a proper position a magnetick needle, while by its rotatory nature\r\nconformed to the earth, dips to some certain degree below the horizon on an\r\noblique sphere. But when the plane of the instrument is moved out of the\r\nplane of the meridian, the magnetick needle (which tends toward the pole)\r\nno longer remains at the degree of its own declination, but inclines more\r\ntoward the centre; for the force of direction is stronger than that of\r\ndeclination, and all power of declination is taken away, if the plane of\r\nthe instrument is on a parallel. For then the magnetick needle, because it\r\ncannot maintain its due position on account of the axis being placed\r\ntransversely, faces down perpendicularly to the earth; and it remains only\r\non its own meridian, or on that which is commonly called the magnetick\r\nmeridian.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nDemonstration of direction, or of variation from the\r\n_true direction, at the same time with declination, by_\r\nmeans of only a single motion in water, due\r\n_to the disposing and rotating virtue._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFix a slender iron wire of three digits length through * a round cork, so\r\nthat the cork may support the iron in water. Let this water be in a\r\ngood-sized glass vase or bowl. Pare the round cork little by little with a\r\nvery sharp knife (so that it may remain round), until it will stay\r\nmotionless one or two digits below the face of the water; and let the wire\r\nbe evenly balanced. {203} [239]Rub one end of the wire thus prepared on the\r\nboreal end of a loadstone and the other on the southern part of the stone\r\n(very skilfully, so that the cork may not be moved ever so little from its\r\nplace) and again place it in the water; then the wire will dip with a\r\ncircular motion on its own centre below the plane of the horizon, in\r\nproportion to the latitude of the region; and, even while dipping, will\r\nalso show the point of variation (the true direction being perturbed). Let\r\nthe loadstone (that with which the iron is rubbed) be a strong one, such as\r\nis needed in all experiments on magnetick declination. When the iron, thus\r\nput into the water and prepared by means of the loadstone, has settled in\r\nthe dip, the lower end remains at the point of variation on the arc of a\r\ngreat circle or magnetick meridian passing through the Zenith or vertex,\r\nand the point of variation on the horizon, and the lowest point of the\r\nheavens, which they call the Nadir. This fact is shown by placing a rather\r\nlong magnetick versorium on one side a little way from the vase. This is a\r\ndemonstration of a more absolute conformity of a magnetick body with the\r\nearth's body as regards unity; in it is made {204} apparent, in a natural\r\nmanner, the direction, with its variation, and the declination. But it must\r\nbe understood that as it is a curious and difficult experiment, so it does\r\nnot remain long in the middle of the water, but sinks at length to the\r\nbottom, when the cork has imbibed too much moisture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nOn the variation of the declination.\r\n\r\nDirection has been spoken of previously, and also * variation, which is\r\nlike a kind of dragging aside of the direction. Now in declination such\r\nirregular motion is also noticed, when the needle dips beyond the proper\r\npoint or when sometimes it does not reach its mark. There is therefore a\r\nvariation of declination, being the arc of a magnetick meridian between the\r\ntrue and apparent declination. For as, on account of terrestrial\r\nelevations, magnetick bodies are drawn away from the true meridian, so also\r\nthe needle dips (its rotation being increased a little) beyond its genuine\r\nposition. For as variation is a deviation of the direction, so also, owing\r\nto the same cause, there is some error of declination, though often very\r\nslight. Sometimes, also, when there is no variation of direction in the\r\nhorizontal, there may nevertheless be variation of the declination; namely,\r\neither when more vigorous parts of the earth crop out exactly meridionally,\r\n_i.e._ under the very meridian; or when those parts are less powerful than\r\nnature in general requires; or when the virtue is too much intensified in\r\none part, or weakened in another, just as one may observe in the vast\r\nocean. And this discrepant nature and varying effect may be easily seen in\r\ncertain parts of almost any round loadstone. Inæquality of power is\r\nrecognized in any part of a terrella by trial of the demonstration in chap.\r\n2 of this book. But the effect is clearly demonstrated by the instrument\r\nfor showing declination in chap. 3 of this book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{205} CHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nOn the essential magnetick activity sphærically\r\n_effused._\r\n\r\nDiscourse hath often been held concerning the * poles of the earth and of\r\nthe stone, and concerning the æquinoctial zone; whilst lately we have been\r\nspeaking about the declining of magneticks toward the earth and toward the\r\nterrella, and the causes of it. But while by various and complicated\r\ndevices we have laboured long and hard to arrive at the cause of this\r\ndeclination, we have by good fortune found out a new and admirable (beyond\r\nthe marvels of all virtues magnetical) science of the orbes themselves. For\r\nsuch is the power of magnetick globes, that it is diffused and extended\r\ninto orbes outside the body itself, the form being carried beyond the\r\nlimits of the corporeal substance; and a mind diligently versed in this\r\nstudy of nature will find the definite causes of the motions and\r\nrevolutions. The same powers of a terrella exist also within the whole orbe\r\nof its power; and these orbes at any distance from the body of the terrella\r\nhave in themselves, in proportion to their diameter and the magnitude of\r\ntheir circumference, their own limits of influences, or points wherein\r\nmagnetick bodies rotate; but they do not look toward the same part of the\r\nterrella or the same point at any distance from the same (unless they be on\r\nthe axis of the orbes and of the terrella); but they always tend to those\r\npoints of their own orbes, which are distant by similar arcs from the\r\ncommon axis of the orbes. As, for example, in the following diagram, we\r\nshow the body of a terrella, with its poles and æquator; and also a\r\nversorium on three other concentrick orbes around the terrella at some\r\ndistance from it. In these orbes (as in all those which we may imagine\r\nwithout end) the magnetick body or versorium conforms to its own orbe in\r\nwhich it is located, and to its diameter and poles and æquator, not to\r\nthose of the terrella; and it is by them and according to the magnitude of\r\ntheir orbes that the magnetick body is governed, rotated, and directed, in\r\nany arc of that orbe, both while the centre of the magnetick body stands\r\nstill, and also while it moves along. And yet we do not mean that the\r\nmagnetick forms and orbes exist in air or water or in any medium that is\r\nnot magnetical; as if the air or the water were susceptible of them, or\r\nwere induced by them; for the forms are only effused and really subsist\r\nwhen magnetick substances are there; whence a magnetick body is laid hold\r\nof within the forces and limits of the orbes; and within the orbes\r\nmagneticks {206} dispose magneticks and incite them, as if the orbes of\r\nvirtue were solid and material loadstones. For the magnetick force does not\r\npass through the whole medium or really exist as in a continuous body; so\r\nthe orbes are magnetick, and yet not real orbes nor existent by themselves.\r\n\r\n_Diagram of motions in magnetick orbes._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA B is the axis of the terrella and of the orbes, C D the æquator. On all\r\nthe orbes, as on the terrella, at the equator the versorium arranges itself\r\nalong the plane of the horizon; on the axis it everywhere looks\r\nperpendicularly toward the centre; in the intermediate spaces E looks\r\ntoward D; and G looks toward H, not toward F, as the versorium L does on\r\nthe surface of the terrella. But as is the relation of L to F on the\r\nsurface of the terella, so is that of G to H on its orbe and of E to D on\r\nits orbe; also all the rotations on {207} the orbes toward the termini of\r\nthe orbes are such as they are on the surface of the terrella, or toward\r\nthe termini of its surface. But if in the more remote orbes this fails\r\nsomewhat at times, it happens on account of the sluggishness of the stone,\r\nor on account of the feebler forces due to the too great distance of the\r\norbes from the terrella.\r\n\r\n_Demonstration._\r\n\r\nSet upon the instrumental diagram described farther back [chap. 3] a plate\r\nor stiff circle of brass or tin, on which may be described the magnetick\r\norbes, as in the diagram above; and in the middle let a hole be made\r\naccording to the size of the terrella, so that the plate may lie evenly on\r\nthe wood about the middle of the terrella on a meridional circle. Then let\r\na small versorium of the length of a barley-corn be placed on any orbe;\r\nupon which, when it is moved to various positions on the same circle, it\r\nwill always pay regard to the dimensions of that orbe, not to those of the\r\nstone; as is shown in the diagram of the effused magnetick forms.\r\n\r\nWhile some assign occult and hidden virtues of substances, others a\r\nproperty of matter, as the causes of the wonderful magnetical effects; we\r\nhave discovered the primary substantive form of globes, not from a\r\nconjectural shadow of the truth of reasons variously controverted; but we\r\nhave laid hold of the true efficient cause, as from many other\r\ndemonstrations, so also from this most certain diagram of magnetick forces\r\neffused by the form. Though this (the form) has not been brought under any\r\nof our senses, and on that account is the less perceived by the intellect,\r\nit now appears manifest and conspicuous even to the eyes through this\r\nessential activity which proceeds from it as light from a lamp. And here it\r\nmust be noted that a magnetick needle, moved on the top of the earth or of\r\na terrella or of the effused orbes, makes two complete rotations in one\r\ncircuit of its centre, like some epicycle about its orbit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{208} CHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nMagnetick force is animate, or imitates life; and in\r\nmany things surpasses human life, while this is bound\r\n_up in the organick body_.\r\n\r\nA loadstone is a wonderful thing in very many experiments, and like a\r\nliving creature. And one of its remarkable virtues is that which the\r\nancients considered to be a living soul in the sky, in the globes and in\r\nthe stars, in the sun and in the moon. For they suspected that such various\r\nmotions could not arise without a divine and animate nature, immense bodies\r\nturned about in fixed times, and wonderful powers infused into other\r\nbodies; whereby the whole universe flourishes in most beautiful variety,\r\nthrough this primary form of the globes themselves. The ancients, as\r\nThales, Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, Pythagoras, Empedocles,\r\nParmenides, Plato, and all the Platonists, and not only the older Greeks,\r\nbut the Egyptians and Chaldæans, seek for some universal life in the\r\nuniverse, and affirm that the whole universe is endowed with life.\r\nAristotle affirms that not the whole universe is animate, but only the sky;\r\nbut he maintains that its elements are inanimate; whilst the stars\r\nthemselves are animate. We, however, find this life in globes only and in\r\ntheir homogenic parts; and though it is not the same in all globes (for it\r\nis much more eminent in the sun and in certain stars than in others of less\r\nnobility) yet in very many the lives of the globes agree in their powers.\r\nFor each several homogenic part draws to its own globe in a similar manner,\r\nand has an inclination to the common direction of the whole in the\r\nuniverse; and the effused forms extend outward in all, and are carried out\r\ninto an orbe, and have bounds of their own; hence the order and regularity\r\nof the motions and rotations of all the planets, and their courses, not\r\nwandering away, but fixed and determined. Wherefore Aristotle concedes life\r\nto the sphæres themselves and to the orbes of the heavens (which he\r\nfeigns), because they are suitable and fitted for a circular motion and\r\nactions, and are carried along in fixed and definite courses. It is surely\r\nwonderful, why the globe of the earth alone with its emanations is\r\ncondemned by him and his followers and cast into exile (as senseless and\r\nlifeless), and driven out of all the perfection of the excellent universe.\r\nIt is treated as a small corpuscle in comparison with the whole, and in the\r\nnumerous concourse of many thousands it is obscure, disregarded, and\r\nunhonoured. {209} With it also they connect the kindred elements, in a like\r\nunhappiness, wretched and neglected. Let this therefore be looked upon as a\r\nmonstrosity in the Aristotelian universe, in which everything is perfect,\r\nvigorous, animated; whilst the earth alone, an unhappy portion, is paltry,\r\nimperfect, dead, inanimate, and decadent. But on the other hand Hermes,\r\nZoroaster, Orpheus, recognize a universal life. We, however, consider that\r\nthe whole universe is animated, and that all the globes, all the stars, and\r\nalso the noble earth have been governed since the beginning by their own\r\nappointed souls and have the motives of self-conservation. Nor are there\r\nwanting, either implanted in their homogenic nature or scattered through\r\ntheir homogenic substance, organs suitable for organic activity, although\r\nthese are not fashioned of flesh and blood as animals, or composed of\r\nregular limbs, which are also hardly perceptible in certain plants and\r\nvegetables; since regular limbs are not necessary for all life. Nor can any\r\norgans be discerned or imagined by us in any of the stars, the sun, or the\r\nplanets, which are specially operative in the universe; yet they live and\r\nimbue with life the small particles in the prominences on the earth. If\r\nthere be anything of which men can boast, it is in fact life, intelligence;\r\nfor the other animals are ennobled by life; God also (by whose nod all\r\nthings are ruled) is a living soul. Who therefore will demand organs for\r\nthe divine intelligences, which rise superior to every combination of\r\norgans and are not restrained by materialized organs? But in the several\r\nbodies of the stars the implanted force acts otherwise than in those divine\r\nexistences which are supernaturally ordained; and in the stars, the sources\r\nof things, otherwise than in animals; in animals again otherwise than in\r\nplants. Miserable were the condition of the stars, abject the lot of the\r\nearth, if that wonderful dignity of life be denied to them, which is\r\nconceded to worms, ants, moths, plants, and toadstools; for thus worms,\r\nmoths, grubs would be bodies more honoured and perfect in nature; for\r\nwithout life no body is excellent, valuable, or distinguished. But since\r\nliving bodies arise and receive life from the earth and the sun, and grass\r\ngrows on the earth apart from any seeds thrown down (as when soil is dug up\r\nfrom deep down in the earth, and put on some very high place or on a very\r\nhigh tower, in a sunny spot, not so long after various grasses spring up\r\nunbidden) it is not likely that they can produce what is not in them; but\r\nthey awaken life, and therefore they are living. Therefore the bodies of\r\nthe globes, as important parts of the universe, in order that they might be\r\nindependent and that they might continue in that condition, had a need for\r\nsouls to be united with them, without which there can be neither life, nor\r\nprimary activity, nor motion, nor coalition, nor controlling power, nor\r\nharmony, nor endeavour, nor sympathy; and without which there would be no\r\ngeneration {210} of anything, no alternations of the seasons, no\r\npropagation; but all things would be carried this way and that, and the\r\nwhole universe would fall into wretchedest Chaos, the earth in short would\r\nbe vacant, dead, and useless. But it is only on the superficies of the\r\nglobes that the concourse of living and animated beings is clearly\r\nperceived, in the great and pleasing variety of which the great\r\nmaster-workman is well pleased. But those souls which are restrained within\r\na kind of barrier and in prison cells, as it were, do not emit immaterial\r\neffused forms outside the limits of their bodies; and bodies are not moved\r\nby them without labour and waste. They are brought and carried away by a\r\nbreath; and when this has calmed down or been suppressed by some untoward\r\ninfluence, their bodies lie like the dregs of the universe and as the\r\nrefuse of the globes. But the globes themselves remain and continue from\r\nyear to year, move, and advance, and complete their courses, without waste\r\nor weariness. The human soul uses reason, sees many things, inquires about\r\nmany more; but even the best instructed receives by his external senses (as\r\nthrough a lattice) light and the beginnings of knowledge. Hence come so\r\nmany errors and follies, by which our judgments and the actions of our\r\nlives are perverted; so that few or none order their actions rightly and\r\njustly. But the magnetick force of the earth and the formate life or living\r\nform of the globes, without perception, without error, without injury from\r\nills and diseases, so present with us, has an implanted activity, vigorous\r\nthrough the whole material mass, fixed, constant, directive, executive,\r\ngoverning, consentient; by which the generation and death of all things are\r\ncarried on upon the surface. For, without that motion, by which the daily\r\nrevolution is performed, all earthly things around us would ever remain\r\nsavage and neglected, and more than deserted and absolutely idle. But those\r\nmotions in the sources of nature are not caused by thinking, by petty\r\nsyllogisms, and theories, as human actions, which are wavering, imperfect,\r\nand undecided; but along with them reason, instruction, knowledge,\r\ndiscrimination have their origin, from which definite and determined\r\nactions arise, from the very foundations that have been laid and the very\r\nbeginnings of the universe; which we, on account of the infirmity of our\r\nminds, cannot comprehend. Wherefore Thales, not without cause (as Aristotle\r\nrelates in his book _De Anima_), held that the loadstone was animate, being\r\na part and a choice offspring of its animate mother the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{211} [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBOOK SIXTH.\r\n\r\n_CHAP. I._\r\n\r\nON THE GLOBE OF THE EARTH, THE\r\n_great magnet_.\r\n\r\nHitherto our subject hath been the loadstone and things magnetical: how\r\nthey conspire together, and are acted upon, how they conform themselves to\r\nthe terrella and to the earth. Now must we consider separately the globe\r\nitself of the earth. Those experiments which have been proved by means of\r\nthe terrella, how magnetick things conform themselves to the terrella, are\r\nall or at least the principal and most important of them, displayed by\r\nmeans of the earth's Body: And to the earth things magnetical are in all\r\nrespects associate. First, as in the terrella the æquator, meridians,\r\nparallels, axis, poles are natural boundaries, as numerous experiments make\r\nplain: So also in the earth these boundaries are natural, not mathematical\r\nonly (as all before us used to suppose). These boundaries the same\r\nexperiments display and establish in both cases alike, in the earth no less\r\nthan in the terrella. Just as on the periphery of a terrella a loadstone or\r\na magnetick piece of iron is directed to its proper pole: so on the earth's\r\nsurface are there turnings-about, peculiar, manifest, and constant on\r\neither side of the æquator. Iron is indued with verticity by being extended\r\ntoward a pole of the earth, just as toward a pole of the terrella: By its\r\nbeing placed down also, and cooling toward the earth's pole after the\r\npristine verticity has {212} been annulled by fire, it acquires new\r\nverticity, conformable to its position earthward. Iron rods also, when\r\nplaced some considerable time toward the poles, acquire verticity merely by\r\nregarding the earth; just as the same rods, if placed toward the pole of a\r\nloadstone, even without touching it, receive polar virtue. There is no\r\nmagnetick body that in any way runs to the terrella which does not also\r\nwait upon the earth. As a loadstone is stronger at one end on one side or\r\nother[240] of its æquator: so is the same property displayed by a small\r\nterrella upon the surface of a larger terrella. According to the variety\r\nand artistick skill in the rubbing of the magnetick iron upon the terrella,\r\nso do the magnetick things perform their function more efficiently or more\r\nfeebly. In motions toward the earth's body, as toward the terrella a\r\nvariation is displayed due to the unlikeness, inequality, and imperfection\r\nof its eminences: So every variation of the versorium or mariners' compass,\r\neverywhere by land or by sea, which thing has so sorely disturbed men's\r\nminds, is discerned and recognized as due to the same causes. The magnetick\r\ndip (which is the wonderful turning of magnetick things to the body of the\r\nterrella) in systematick course, is seen in clearer light to be the same\r\nthing upon the earth. And that single experiment, by a wonderful\r\nindication, as with a finger, proclaims the grand magnetick nature of the\r\nearth to be innate and diffused through all her inward parts. A magnetick\r\nvigour exists then in the earth just as in the terrella, which is a part of\r\nthe earth, homogenic in nature with it, but rounded by Art, so as to\r\ncorrespond with the earth's globous shape and in order that in the chief\r\nexperiments it might accord with the globe of the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nThe Magnetick axis of the Earth\r\n_persists invariable_.\r\n\r\nAs in the very first beginnings of the moving world, the earth's magnetick\r\naxis passed through the midst of the earth: so now it tends through the\r\ncentre to the same points of the superficies; the circle and plane of the\r\næquinoctial line also persisting. For not without the vastest overthrow of\r\nthe terrene mass can these natural boundaries be changed, as it is easy to\r\ngather from magnetick demonstrations. Wherfore the opinion of Dominicus\r\nMaria of Ferrara, a most talented man, who was the teacher of Nicolas\r\nCopernicus, must be cancelled; a view {213} which, according to certain\r\nobservations of his own, is as follows.[241] \"I,\" he says, \"in former years\r\nwhile studying Ptolemy's _Geographia_ discovered that the elevations of the\r\nNorth pole placed by him in the several regions, fall short of what they\r\nare in our time by one degree and ten minutes: which divergence can by no\r\nmeans be ascribed to an error of the tables: For it is not credible that\r\nthe whole series in the book is equally wrong in the figures of the tables:\r\nHence it is necessary to allow that the North pole has been tilted toward\r\nthe vertical point. Accordingly a lengthy observation has already begun to\r\ndisclose to us things hidden from our forefathers; not indeed through any\r\nsloth of theirs, but because they lacked the prolonged observation of their\r\npredecessors: For before Ptolemy very few places were observed with regard\r\nto the elevations of the pole, as he himself also bears witness at the\r\nbeginning of his _Cosmographia_: (For, says he) Hipparchus alone hath\r\nhanded down to us the latitudes of a few places, but a good many have noted\r\nthose of distances; especially those which lie toward sunrise or sunset\r\nwere received by some general tradition, not owing to any sloth on the part\r\nof authors themselves, but to the fact that there was as yet no practice of\r\nmore exact mathematicks. 'Tis accordingly no wonder, if our predecessors\r\ndid not mark this very slow motion: For in one thousand and seventy years\r\nit shows itself to be displaced scarce one degree toward the apex of\r\ndwellers upon the earth. The strait of Gibraltar shows this, where in\r\nPtolemy's time the North pole appears elevated 36 degrees and a quarter\r\nfrom the Horizon: whereas now it is 37 and two-fifths. The like divergence\r\nis also shown at Leucopetra in Calabria, and at particular spots in Italy,\r\nnamely those which have not changed from Ptolemy's time to our own. And so\r\nby reason of this movement, places now inhabited will some day become\r\ndeserted, while those regions which are now parched at the torrid zone\r\nwill, though long hence, be reduced to our temper of climate. Thus, as in a\r\ncourse of three hundred and ninety five thousands of years, is that very\r\nslow movement completed.\" Thus, according to these observations of\r\nDominicus Maria, the North pole is at a higher elevation, and the latitudes\r\nof places are greater than formerly; whence he argues a change of\r\nlatitudes. Now, however, Stadius, taking just the contrary view, proves by\r\nobservations that the latitudes have decreased. For he says: \"The latitude\r\nof Rome in Ptolemy's _Geographia_ is 41 degrees 2/3: and that you may not\r\nsuppose any error of reckoning to have crept in on the part of Ptolemy, on\r\nthe day of the Æquinox in the city of Rome, the ninth part of the gnomon of\r\nthe sun-dial is lacking in shadow, as Pliny relates and Vitruvius\r\nwitnesseth in his ninth book.\" But the observation of moderns (according to\r\nErasmus Rheinholdus) gives the same in our time as 41 degrees with a sixth:\r\nso that you are in doubt as to half of one degree in {214} the centre of\r\nthe world, whether you show it to have decreased by the earth's obliquity\r\nof motion. One may see then how from inexact observations men rashly\r\nconceive new and contradictory opinions and imagine absurd motions of the\r\nmechanism of the earth. For since Ptolemy only received certain latitudes\r\nfrom Hipparchus, and did not in very many places make the observations\r\nhimself; it is likely that he himself, knowing the position of the places,\r\nformed his estimate of the latitude of cities from probable conjecture\r\nonly, and then placed it in the maps. Thus one may see, in the case of our\r\nown Britain, that the latitudes of cities are wrong by two or three\r\ndegrees, as experience teaches. Wherefore all the less should we from those\r\nmistakes infer a new motion, or let the noble magnetick nature of the earth\r\nbe debased for an opinion so lightly conceived. Moreover, those mistakes\r\ncrept the more readily into geography, from the fact that the magnetick\r\nvirtue was utterly unknown to those geographers. Besides, observations of\r\nlatitudes cannot be made sufficiently exactly, except by experts, using\r\nalso finer instruments, and taking into account the refraction of the\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nOn the magnetick diurnal revolution of the Earth's\r\nglobe, as a probable assertion against the time-honoured\r\n_opinion of a Primum Mobile_.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients Heraclides of Pontus and Ecphantus, afterwards the\r\nPythagoreans, as Nicetas of Syracuse and Aristarchus of Samos, and some\r\nothers (as it seems), used to think that the earth moves, and that the\r\nstars set by the interposition of the earth and rose by her retirement. In\r\nfact they set the earth moving and make her revolve around her axis from\r\nwest to east, like a wheel turning on its axle. Philolaus the\r\nPythagorean[242] would have the earth to be one of the stars, and believed\r\nthat it turned in an oblique circle around fire, just as the sun and moon\r\nhave their own courses. He was a distinguished mathematician, and a most\r\nable investigator of nature. But after Philosophy became a subject treated\r\nof by very many and was popularized, theories adapted to the vulgar\r\nintelligence or based on sophistical subtility occupied the minds of most\r\nmen, and prevailed like a torrent, the multitude consenting. Thereupon many\r\nvaluable discoveries of the ancients were rejected, and were dismissed to\r\nperish in banishment; or at least by not being further cultivated and\r\ndeveloped became obsolete. So that Copernicus[243] (among later\r\ndiscoverers, a man most deserving of literary honour) is the first who\r\nattempted to illustrate the [Greek: phainomena] of {215} moving bodies by\r\nnew hypotheses: and these demonstrations of reasons others either follow or\r\nobserve in order that they may more surely discover the phænomenal harmony\r\nof the movements; being men of the highest attainments in every kind of\r\nlearning. Thus supposed and imaginary orbs of Ptolemy and others for\r\nfinding the times and periods of the motions are not necessarily to be\r\nadmitted to the physical inquiries of philosophers. It is then an ancient\r\nopinion and one that has come down from old times, but is now augmented by\r\nimportant considerations that the whole earth rotates with a daily\r\nrevolution in the space of 24 hours. Well then, since we see the Sun and\r\nMoon and other planets and the glory of all the stars approach and retire\r\nwithin the space of one natural day, either the Earth herself must needs be\r\nset in motion with a diurnal movement from West to East, or the whole\r\nheaven and the rest of nature from East to West. But, in the first place,\r\nit is not likely that the highest heaven and all those visible splendours\r\nof the fixed stars are impelled along that most rapid and useless course.\r\nBesides, who is the Master who has ever made out that the stars which we\r\ncall fixed are in one and the same sphere, or has established by reasoning\r\nthat there are any real and, as it were, adamantine sphæres? No one has\r\never proved this as a fact; nor is there a doubt but that just as the\r\nplanets are at unequal distances from the earth, [244]so are those vast and\r\nmultitudinous lights separated from the Earth by varying and very remote\r\naltitudes; they are not set in any sphærick frame or firmament (as is\r\nfeigned), nor in any vaulted body: accordingly the intervals of some are\r\nfrom their unfathomable distance matter of opinion rather than of\r\nverification; others do much exceed them and are very far remote, and these\r\nbeing located in the heaven at varying distances, either in the thinnest\r\næther or in that most subtile quintessence, or in the void: how are they to\r\nremain in their position during such a mighty swirl of the vast orbe of\r\nsuch uncertain substance. There have been observed by astronomers 1022\r\nstars; besides these, numberless others are visible, some indeed faint to\r\nour senses, in the case of others our sense is dim and they are hardly\r\nperceived and only by exceptionally keen eyes, and there is no one gifted\r\nwith excellent sight who does not when the Moon is dark and the air at its\r\nrarest, discern numbers and numbers dim and wavering with minute lights on\r\naccount of the great distance: hence it is credible both that these are\r\nmany and that they are never all included in any range of vision. How\r\nimmeasurable then must be the space which stretches to those remotest of\r\nfixed stars! How vast and immense the depth of that imaginary sphere! How\r\nfar removed from the Earth must the most widely separated stars be and at a\r\ndistance transcending all sight, all skill and thought! How monstrous then\r\nsuch a motion {216} would be! It is evident then that all the heavenly\r\nbodies set as if in destined places are there formed into sphæres, that\r\nthey tend to their own centres, and that round them there is a confluence\r\nof all their parts. And if they have motion, that motion will rather be\r\nthat of each round its own centre, as that of the Earth is; or a forward\r\nmovement of the centre in an orbit, as that of the Moon: there would not be\r\ncircular motion in the case of a too numerous and scattered flock. Of these\r\nstars some situate near the Æquator would seem to be borne around at a very\r\nrapid rate, others nearer the pole to have a somewhat gentler motion,\r\nothers, apparently motionless, to have a slight rotation. Yet no\r\ndifferences in point of light, mass or colours are apparent to us: for they\r\nare as brilliant, clear, glittering and duskish toward the poles, as they\r\nare near the Æquator and the Zodiack: those which remain set in those\r\npositions do not hang, and are neither fixed, nor bound to anything of the\r\nnature of a vault. All the more insane were the circumvolution of that\r\nfictitious _Primum Mobile_, which is higher, deeper, and still more\r\nimmeasurable. Moreover, this inconceivable _Primum Mobile_ ought to be\r\nmaterial and of enormous depth, far surpassing all inferior nature in size:\r\nfor nohow else could it conduct from East to West so many and such vast\r\nbodies of stars, and the universe even down to the Earth: and it requires\r\nus to accept in the government of the stars a universal power and a\r\ndespotism perpetual and intensely irksome. That _Primum Mobile_ bears no\r\nvisible body, is nohow recognizable, is a fiction believed in by those\r\npeople, accepted by the weak-minded folk, who wonder more at our\r\nterrestrial mass than at bodies so vast, so inconceivable, and so far\r\nseparated from us. But there can be no movement of infinity and of an\r\ninfinite body, and therefore no diurnal revolution of that vastest _Primum\r\nMobile_. The Moon being neighbour to the Earth revolves in 27 days; Mercury\r\nand Venus have their own moderately slow motions; Mars finishes a period in\r\ntwo years, Jupiter in twelve years, Saturn in thirty. And those also who\r\nascribe a motion to the fixed stars make out that it is completed in 36,000\r\nyears, according to Ptolemy, in 25,816 years, according to Copernicus'\r\nobservations; so that the motion and the completion of the journey always\r\nbecome slower in the case of the greater circles. And would there then be a\r\ndiurnal motion of that _Primum Mobile_ which is so great and beyond them\r\nall immense and profound? 'Tis indeed a superstition and in the view of\r\nphilosophy a fable now only to be believed by idiots, deserving more than\r\nridicule from the learned: and yet in former ages, that motion, under the\r\npressure of an importunate mob of philosophizers, was actually accepted as\r\na basis of computations and of motions, by mathematicians. The motions of\r\nthe bodies (namely planets) seem to take place eastward and following the\r\norder of the signs. {217} The common run of mathematicians and philosophers\r\nalso suppose that the fixed stars in the same manner advance with a very\r\nslow motion: and from ignorance of the truth they are forced to join to\r\nthem a ninth sphære. Whereas now this first and unthinkable _Primum\r\nMobile_, a fiction not comprehended by any judgment, not evidenced by any\r\nvisible constellation, but devised of imagination only and mathematical\r\nhypothesis, unfortunately accepted and believed by philosophers, extended\r\ninto the heaven and beyond all the stars, must needs with a contrary\r\nimpulse turn about from East to West, in opposition to the inclination of\r\nall the rest of the Universe. Whatsoever in nature is moved naturally, the\r\nsame is set in motion both by its own forces and by the consentient compact\r\nof other bodies. Such is the motion of parts to their whole, of all\r\ninterdependent sphæres and stars in the universe: such is the circular\r\nimpulse in the bodies of the planets, when they affect and incite one\r\nanother's courses. But with regard to the _Primum Mobile_ and its contrary\r\nand exceeding rapid movement, what are the bodies which incite it or propel\r\nit? What is the nature that conspires with it? Or what is that mad force\r\nbeyond the _Primum Mobile_? Since it is in bodies themselves that acting\r\nforce resides, not in spaces or intervals. But he who thinks that those\r\nbodies are at leisure and keeping holiday, while all the virtue of the\r\nuniverse appertains to the very orbits and sphæres, is on this point not\r\nless mad than he who, in some one else's house, thinks that the walls and\r\nfloors and roof rule the family rather than the wife and thoughtful\r\npaterfamilias. Therefore not by the firmament are they borne along, or are\r\nmoved, or have their position; much less are those confused crowds of stars\r\nwhirled around by the _Primum Mobile_, nor are they torn away and huddled\r\nalong by a contrary and extremely rapid movement. Ptolemy of Alexandria\r\nseems to be too timid and weak-minded in dreading the dissolution of this\r\nnether world, were the Earth to be moved round in a circle. Why does he not\r\nfear the ruin of the Universe, dissolution, confusion, conflagration, and\r\ninfinite disasters celestial and super-celestial, from a motion\r\ntranscending all thoughts, dreams, fables, and poetic licences,\r\ninsurmountable, ineffable, and inconceivable? Wherefore we are carried\r\nalong by a diurnal rotation of the earth (a motion for sure more\r\ncongruous), and as a boat moves above the waters, so do we turn about with\r\nthe earth, and yet seem to ourselves to be stationary, and at rest. Great\r\nand incredible it seems to some philosophers, by reason of inveterate\r\nprejudice, that the Earth's vast body should be swirled wholly round in the\r\nspace of 24 hours. But it would be more incredible that the Moon should\r\ntravel through her orbit, or complete an entire course in a space of 24\r\nhours; more so the Sun or Mars; still more Jupiter and Saturn; more than\r\nmarvellous would be the velocity in the case of the {218} fixed stars and\r\nthe firmament; what in the world they would have to wonder at in the case\r\nof their ninth sphere, let them imagine as they like. But to feign a\r\n_Primum Mobile_ and to attribute to the thing thus feigned a motion to be\r\ncompleted in the space of 24 hours, and not to allow this motion to the\r\nEarth in the same interval of time, is absurd. For a great circle of the\r\nEarth is to the ambit of the _Primum Mobile_ less than a furlong to the\r\nwhole Earth. If the diurnal rotation of the Earth seem headlong, and not\r\nadmissible in nature by reason of its rapidity, worse than insane will be\r\nthe movement of the _Primum Mobile_ both for itself and the whole universe,\r\nagreeing as it does with no other motion in any proportion or likeness. It\r\nseems to Ptolemy and the Peripateticks that nature must be disordered, and\r\nthe framework and structure of this globe of ours be dissolved, by reason\r\nof so swift a terrestrial revolution. The Earth's diameter is 1718 German\r\nmiles; the greatest elongation of the new Moon is 65, the least is 55\r\nsemi-diameters of the Earth: the greatest altitude of the half moon is 68,\r\nthe least 52: yet it is probable that its sphære is still larger and\r\ndeeper. The sun in its greatest eccentricity has a distance of 1142\r\nsemi-diameters of the Earth; Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, being slower in motion,\r\nare so proportionately further remote from the Earth. The distances of the\r\nfirmament and of the fixed stars seem to the best mathematicians\r\ninconceivable. Leaving out the ninth sphære, if the convexity of the\r\n_Primum Mobile_ be duly estimated in proportion to the rest of the sphæres,\r\nthe vault of the _Primum Mobile_ must in one hour run through as much space\r\nas is comprised in 3000 great circles of the Earth, for in the vault of the\r\nfirmament it would complete more than 1800; but what iron solidity can be\r\nimagined so firm and tough as not to be disrupted and shattered to\r\nfragments by a fury so great and a velocity so ineffable. The Chaldæans\r\nindeed would have it that the heaven consists of light. In light, however,\r\nthere is no so-great firmness, neither is there in Plotinus' fiery\r\nfirmament, nor in the fluid or aqueous or supremely rare and transparent\r\nheaven of the divine Moses, which does not cut off from our sight the\r\nlights of the stars. We must accordingly reject the so deep-set error about\r\nthis so mad and furious a celestial velocity, and the forced retardation of\r\nthe rest of the heavens. Let theologians discard and wipe out with sponges\r\nthose old women's tales of so rapid a spinning round of the heavens\r\nborrowed from certain inconsiderate philosophers. The sun is not propelled\r\nby the sphære of Mars (if a sphære there be) and by his motion, nor Mars by\r\nJupiter, nor Jupiter by Saturn. The sphære, too, of the fixed stars, seems\r\nwell enough regulated except so far as motions which are in the Earth are\r\nascribed to the heavens, and bring about a certain change of phænomena. The\r\nsuperiors do not exercise a despotism over the inferiors; for the heaven of\r\n{219} philosophers, as of theologians, must be gentle, happy, and tranquil,\r\nand not at all subject to changes: nor shall the force, fury, swiftness,\r\nand hurry of a _Primum Mobile_ have dominion over it. That fury descends\r\nthrough all the celestial sphæres, and celestial bodies, invades the\r\nelements of our philosophers, sweeps fire along, rolls along the air, or at\r\nleast draws the chief part of it, conducts the universal æther, and turns\r\nabout fiery impressions (as if it were a solid and firm body, when in fact\r\nit is a most refined essence, neither resisting nor drawing), leads captive\r\nthe superior. O marvellous constancy of the terrestrial globe, the only one\r\nunconquered; and yet one that is holden fast, or stationary, in its place\r\nby no bonds, no heaviness, by no contiguity with a grosser or firmer body,\r\nby no weights. The substance of the terrestrial globe withstands and sets\r\nitself against universal nature. Aristotle feigns for himself a system of\r\nphilosophy founded on motions simple and compound, that the heavens revolve\r\nin a simple circle, its elements moving with a right motion, the parts of\r\nthe earth seeking the earth in straight lines, falling on its surface at\r\nright angles, and tending together toward its centre, always, however, at\r\nrest therein; accordingly also the whole Earth remains immovable in its\r\nplace, united and compacted together by its own weight. That cohæsion of\r\nparts and aggregation of matter exist in the Sun, in the Moon, in the\r\nplanets, in the fixed stars, in fine in all those round bodies whose parts\r\ncohære together and tend each to their own centres; otherwise the heaven\r\nwould fall, and that sublime ordering would be lost: yet these coelestial\r\nbodies have a circular motion. Whence the Earth too may equally have her\r\nown motion: and this motion is not (as some deem it) unsuitable for the\r\nassembling or adverse to the generation of things. For since it is innate\r\nin the terrestrial globe, and natural to it; and since there is nothing\r\nexternal that can shock it, or hinder it by adverse motions, it goes round\r\nwithout any ill or danger, it advances without being forced, there is\r\nnothing that resists, nothing that by retiring gives way, but all is open.\r\nFor while it revolves in a space void of bodies, or in the incorporeal\r\næther, all the air, the exhalations of land and water, the clouds and\r\npendent meteors, are impelled along with the globe circularly: that which\r\nis above the exhalations is void of bodies: the finest bodies and those\r\nwhich are least cohærent almost void are not impeded, are not dissolved,\r\nwhile passing through it. Wherefore also the whole terrestrial globe, with\r\nall its adjuncts, moves bodily along, calmly, meeting no resistance.\r\nWherefore empty and superstitious is the fear that some weak minds have of\r\na shock of bodies (like Lucius Lactantius, who, in the fashion of the\r\nunlettered rabble and of the most unreasonable men scoffs at an Antipodes\r\nand at the sphærick ordering of the Earth all round). So for these reasons,\r\nnot only probable but manifest, does the diurnal rotation of the earth\r\nseem, {220} since nature always acts through a few rather than through\r\nmany; and it is more agreeable to reason that the Earth's one small body\r\nshould make a diurnal rotation, than that the whole universe should be\r\nwhirled around. I pass over the reasons of the Earth's remaining motions,\r\nfor at present the only question is concerning its diurnal movement,\r\naccording to which it moves round with respect to the Sun, and creates a\r\nnatural day (which we call a nycthemeron[245]). And indeed Nature may be\r\nthought to have granted a motion very suitable to the Earth's shape, which\r\n(being sphærical) is revolved about the poles assigned it by Nature much\r\nmore easily and fittingly than that the whole universe, whose limit is\r\nunknown and unknowable, should be whirled round; and than there could be\r\nimagined an orbit of the _Primum Mobile_, a thing not accepted by the\r\nancients, which Aristotle even did not devise or accept as in any shape or\r\nform existing beyond the sphære of the fixed stars; which finally the\r\nsacred scriptures do not recognize any more than they do the revolution of\r\nthe firmament.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\nThat the Earth moves circularly.\r\n\r\nIf then the philosophers of the common sort, with an unspeakable absurdity,\r\nimagine the whole heaven and the vast extent of the universe to rotate in a\r\nwhirl, it yet remains that the earth performs a diurnal change. For in no\r\nthird way can the apparent revolutions be explained. This day, then, which\r\nis called natural, is a revolution of some meridian of the Earth from Sun\r\nto Sun. It revolves indeed in an entire course, from a fixed star round to\r\nthat star again. Those bodies which in nature are moved with a circular,\r\næquable and constant motion, are furnished, in their parts, with various\r\nboundaries. But the Earth is not a Chaos nor disordered mass; but by reason\r\nof its astral virtue, it has boundaries which subserve the circular motion,\r\npoles not mathematical, an æquator not devised by imagination, meridians\r\nalso and parallels; all of which we find permanent, certain and natural in\r\nthe Earth: which by numerous experiments the whole magnetick philosophy\r\nsets forth. For in the earth there are poles set in fixed bounds, and at\r\nthem the verticity mounts up on either side from the plane of the Earth's\r\næquator, with forces which are mightier and præpotent from the common\r\naction of the whole; and with these poles the diurnal revolution is in\r\nagreement. But in no turnings-about of bodies, in none of the motions of\r\nthe planets are there to be recognized, beheld, or assured to us by any\r\nreasoning any sensible or natural poles in the firmament, or in any\r\n_Primum_ {221} _Mobile_; but those are the conception of an unsettled\r\nimagination. Wherefore we, following an evident, sensible and tested cause,\r\ndo know that the earth moves on its own poles, which are apparent to us by\r\nmany magnetick demonstrations. For not only on the ground of its constancy,\r\nand its sure and permanent position, is the Earth endowed with poles and\r\nverticity: for it might be directed toward other parts of the universe,\r\ntoward East or West or some other region. By the wondrous wisdom then of\r\nthe Builder forces, primarily animate, have been implanted in the Earth,\r\nthat with determinate constancy the Earth may take its direction, and the\r\npoles have been placed truly opposite[246], that about them as the termini,\r\nas it were, of some axis, the motion of diurnal turning might be performed.\r\nBut the constancy of the poles is regulated by the primary soul. Wherefore,\r\nfor the Earth's good, the collimations of her verticities do not\r\ncontinually regard a definite point of the firmament and of the visible\r\nheaven. For changes of the æquinoxes take place from a certain deflection\r\nof the Earth's axis; yet in regard to that deflection, the Earth has a\r\nconstancy of motion [Illustration] derived from her own forces. The Earth,\r\nthat she may turn herself about in a diurnal revolution, leans on her\r\npoles. For since at A and B there is constant verticity, and the axis is\r\nstraight; at C and D (the æquinoctial line) the parts are free, the whole\r\nforces on either side being spread out from the plane of the æquator toward\r\nthe poles, in æther which is free from renitency, or else in a void; and A\r\nand B remaining constant, C revolves toward D both from innate conformity\r\nand aptitude, and for necessary good, and the avoidance of evil; but being\r\nchiefly moved forward by the diffusion of the solar orbes of virtues, and\r\nby their lights. And 'tis borne around, not upon a new and strange course,\r\nbut (with the {222} tendency common to the rest of the planets) it tends\r\nfrom West to East. For all planets have a like motion Eastward according to\r\nthe succession of the signs, whether Mercury and Venus revolve beneath the\r\nSun, or around the Sun. That the Earth is capable of and fitted for moving\r\ncircularly its parts show, which when separated from the whole are not only\r\nborne along with the [Illustration] straight movement taught by the\r\nPeripateticks, but rotate also. A loadstone fixed in a wooden vessel is\r\nplaced on water so as to swim freely, turn itself, and float about. If the\r\npole B of the loadstone be set contrary to nature toward the South, F, the\r\nTerrella is turned about its own centre with a circular motion in the plane\r\nof the Horizon, toward the North, E, where it rests, not at C or D. So does\r\na small stone if only of four ounces; it has the same motion also and just\r\nas quick, if it were a strong magnet of one hundred pounds. The largest\r\nmagnetical mountain will possess the same turning-power also, if launched\r\nin a wide river or deep sea: and yet a magnetick body is much more hindered\r\nby water than the whole Earth is by the æther. The whole Earth would do the\r\nsame, if the Boreal pole were to be diverted from its true direction; for\r\nthe Boreal pole would run back with the circular motion of the whole around\r\nthe centre toward the Cynosure. But this motion by which the parts\r\nnaturally settle themselves in their own {223} resting-places is no other\r\nthan circular. The whole Earth regards the Cynosure with her pole according\r\nto a steadfast law of her nature: and thus each true part of it seeks a\r\nlike resting-place in the world, and is moved circularly toward that\r\nposition. The natural movements of the whole and of the parts are alike:\r\nwherefore when the parts are moved in a circle, the whole also has the\r\npotency of [Illustration] moving circularly. A sphærical loadstone placed\r\nin a vessel on water moves circularly around its centre (as is manifest) in\r\nthe plane of the Horizon, into conformity[247] with the earth.\r\n\r\nSo also it would move in any other great circle if it could be free; as in\r\nthe declination instrument, a circular motion takes place in the meridian\r\n(if there were no variation), or, if there should be some variation, in a\r\ngreat circle drawn from the Zenith through the point of variation on the\r\nhorizon. And that circular motion of the magnet to its own just and natural\r\nposition shows that the whole Earth is fitted and adapted, and is\r\nsufficiently furnished with peculiar forces for diurnal circular motion. I\r\nomit what Peter Peregrinus[248] constantly affirms, that a terrella\r\nsuspended above its poles on a meridian moves circularly, making an entire\r\nrevolution in 24 hours: which, however, it has not happened to ourselves as\r\nyet to see; and we even doubt this motion on account of the weight of the\r\nstone itself, as well as because the whole Earth, as she is moved of\r\nherself, so also is she propelled by other stars: and this does not happen\r\nin proportion (as it does in the terrella) {224} in every part. The Earth\r\nis moved by her own primary form and natural desire, for the conservation,\r\nperfection, and ordering of its parts, toward things more excellent: and\r\nthis is more likely than that the fixed stars, those luminous globes, as\r\nwell as the Wanderers, and the most glorious and divine Sun, which are in\r\nno way aided by the Earth, or renewed, or urged by any virtue therein,\r\nshould circulate aimlessly around the Earth, and that the whole heavenly\r\nhost should repeat around the Earth courses never ending and of no profit\r\nwhatever to the stars. The Earth, then, which by some great necessity, even\r\nby a virtue innate, evident, and conspicuous, is turned circularly about\r\nthe Sun, revolves; and by this motion it rejoices in the solar virtues and\r\ninfluences, and is strengthened by its own sure verticity, that it should\r\nnot rovingly revolve over every region of the heavens. The Sun (the chief\r\nagent in nature) as he forwards the courses of the Wanderers, so does he\r\nprompt this turning about of the Earth by the diffusion of the virtues of\r\nhis orbes, and of light. And if the Earth were not made to spin with a\r\ndiurnal revolution, the Sun would ever hang over some determinate part with\r\nconstant beams, and by long tarriance would scorch it, and pulverize it,\r\nand dissipate it, and the Earth would sustain the deepest wounds; and\r\nnothing good would issue forth; it would not vegetate, it would not allow\r\nlife to animals, and mankind would perish. In other parts, all things would\r\nverily be frightful and stark with extreme cold; whence all high places\r\nwould be very rough, unfruitful, inaccessible, covered with a pall of\r\nperpetual shades and eternal night. Since the Earth herself would not\r\nchoose to endure this so miserable and horrid appearance on both her faces,\r\nshe, by her magnetick astral genius, revolves in an orbit, that by a\r\nperpetual change of light there may be a perpetual alternation of things,\r\nheat and cold, risings and settings, day and night, morn and eve, noon and\r\nmidnight. Thus the Earth seeks and re-seeks the Sun, turns away from him\r\nand pursues him, by her own wondrous magnetick virtue. Besides, it is not\r\nonly from the Sun that evil would impend, if the Earth were to stay still\r\nand be deprived of solar benefit; but from the Moon also serious dangers\r\nwould threaten. For we see how the ocean rises and swells beneath certain\r\nknown positions of the Moon: And if there were not through the daily\r\nrotation of Earth a speedy transit of the Moon, the flowing sea would be\r\ndriven above its level into certain regions, and many shores would be\r\noverwhelmed with huge waves. In order then that Earth may not perish in\r\nvarious ways, and be brought to confusion, she turns herself about by\r\nmagnetick and primary virtue: and the like motions exist also in the rest\r\nof the Wanderers, urged specially by the movement and light of other\r\nbodies. For the Moon also turns herself about in a monthly course, to\r\nreceive in succession the Sun's beams in which she, like the Earth, {225}\r\nrejoices, and is refreshed: nor could she endure them for ever on one\r\nparticular side without great harm and sure destruction. Thus each one of\r\nthe moving globes is for its own safety borne in an orbit either in some\r\nwider circle, or only by a rotation of its body, or by both together. But\r\nit is ridiculous for a man a philosopher to suppose that all the fixed\r\nstars and the planets and the still higher heavens revolve to no other\r\npurpose, save the advantage of the Earth. It is the Earth, then, that\r\nrevolves, not the whole heaven, and this motion gives opportunity for the\r\ngrowth and decrease of things, and for the generating of things animate,\r\nand awakens internal heat for the bringing of them to birth. Whence matter\r\nis quickened for receiving forms; and from the primary rotation of the\r\nEarth natural bodies have their primary impetus and original activity. The\r\nmotion then of the whole Earth is primary, astral, circular, around its own\r\npoles, whose verticity arises on both sides from the plane of the æquator,\r\nand whose vigour is infused into opposite termini, in order that the Earth\r\nmay be moved by a sure rotation for its good, the Sun also and the stars\r\nhelping its motion. But the simple straight motion downwards of the\r\nPeripateticks is a motion of weight, a motion of the aggregation of\r\ndisjoined parts, in the ratio of their matter, along straight lines toward\r\nthe body of the Earth: which lines tend the shortest way toward the centre.\r\nThe motions of disjoined magnetical parts of the Earth, besides the motion\r\nof aggregation, are coition, revolution, and the direction of the parts to\r\nthe whole, for harmony of form, and concordancy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nArguments of those denying the Earth's motion, and\r\n_their confutation._\r\n\r\nNow it will not be superfluous to weigh well the arguments of those who say\r\nthe Earth does not move; that we may be better able to satisfy the crowd of\r\nphilosophizers who assert that this constancy and stability of the Earth is\r\nconfirmed by the most convincing arguments. Aristotle does not allow that\r\nthe Earth moves circularly, on the ground that each several part of it\r\nwould be affected by this particular motion; that whereas now all the\r\nseparate parts of the Earth are borne toward the middle in straight lines,\r\nthat circular motion would be violent, and strange to nature, and not\r\nenduring. But it has been before proved that all actual portions of the\r\nEarth move in a circle, and that all magnetick bodies (fitly disposed) are\r\nborne around in an orbe. They are borne, however, toward the centre of the\r\nEarth in a {226} straight line (if the way be open) by a motion of\r\naggregation as though to their own origin: they move by various motions\r\nagreeably to the conformation of the whole: a terrella is moved circularly\r\nby its innate forces. \"Besides\" (says he), \"all things which are borne in\r\nan orbe, afterwards would seem to be abandoned by the first motion, and to\r\nbe borne by several motions besides the first. The Earth must also be borne\r\non by two sorts of motion, whether it be situate around a mid-point, or in\r\nthe middle site of the universe: and if this were so, there must needs be\r\nat one time an advance, at another time a retrogression of the fixed stars:\r\nThis, however, does not seem to be the case, but they rise and set always\r\nthe same in the same places.\" But it by no means follows that a double\r\nmotion must be assigned to the Earth. But if there be but one diurnal\r\nmotion of the Earth around its poles, who does not see that the stars must\r\nalways in the same manner rise and set at the same points of the horizon,\r\neven although there be another motion about which we are not disputing:\r\nsince the mutations in the smaller orbit cause no variation of aspect in\r\nthe fixed stars owing to their great distance, unless the axis of the Earth\r\nhave varied its position, concerning which we raise a question when\r\nspeaking of the cause of the præcession of the æquinoxes. In this argument\r\nare many flaws. For if the Earth revolve, that we asserted must needs occur\r\nnot by reason of the first sphære, but of its innate forces. But if it were\r\nset in motion by the first sphære, there would be no successions of days\r\nand nights, for it would continue its course along with the _Primum\r\nMobile_. But that the Earth is affected by a double movement at the time\r\nwhen it rotates around its own centre, because the rest of the stars move\r\nwith a double motion, does not follow. Besides, he does not well consider\r\nthe argument, nor do his interpreters understand the same. [Greek: toutou\r\nde sumbainontos, anankaion gignesthai parodous kai tropas tôn endedemenôn\r\nastrôn.] (Arist. _de Coelo_, ii. chap. 14.) That is, \"If this be so, there\r\nmust needs be changes, and retrogressions of the fixed stars.\" What some\r\ninterpret as retrogressions or regressions, and changes of the fixed stars,\r\nothers explain as diversions: which terms can in no way be understood of\r\naxial motion, unless he meant that the Earth moved by the _Primum Mobile_\r\nis borne and turned over other poles diverse even from those which\r\ncorrespond to the first sphære, which is altogether absurd. Other later\r\ntheorists suppose that the eastern ocean ought to be impelled so into\r\nwestern regions by that motion, that those parts of the Earth which are dry\r\nand free from water would be daily flooded by the eastern ocean. But the\r\nocean is not acted upon by that movement, since nothing opposes it; and\r\neven the whole atmosphere is carried round: And for that reason in the\r\nEarth's course all the things in the air are not left behind by us nor do\r\nthey seem to move toward the West: Wherefore also the clouds {227} are at\r\nrest in the air, unless the force of the winds drive them; and objects\r\nwhich are projected into the air fall again into their own place. But those\r\nfoolish folk who think that towers, temples, and buildings must necessarily\r\nbe shaken and overthrown by the Earth's motion, may fear lest men at the\r\nAntipodes should slip off into an opposite orbe, or that ships when sailing\r\nround the entire [249]globe should (as soon as they have dipped under the\r\nplane of our horizon) fall into the opposite region of the sky. But those\r\nfollies are old wives' gossip, and the rubbish of certain philosophizers,\r\nmen who, when they essay to treat of the highest truths and the fabrick of\r\nthe universe, and hazard anything, can scarce understand aught _ultra\r\ncrepidam_. They would have the Earth to be the centre of a circle; and\r\ntherefore to rest motionless amid the rotation. But neither the stars nor\r\nthe wandering globes move about the Earth's centre: the high heaven also\r\ndoes not move circularly round the Earth's centre; nor if the Earth were in\r\nthe centre, is it a centre itself, but a body around a centre. Nor is it\r\nconfident with reason that the heavenly bodies of the Peripateticks should\r\nattend on a centre so decadent and perishable as that of the Earth. They\r\nthink that Nature seeks rest for the generation of things, and for\r\npromoting their increase while growing; and that accordingly the whole\r\nEarth is at rest. And yet all generation takes place from motion, without\r\nwhich the universal nature of things would become torpid. The motion of the\r\nSun, the motion of the Moon, cause changes; the motion of the Earth awakens\r\nthe internal breath of the globe; animals themselves do not live without\r\nmotion, and the ceaseless activity of the heart and arteries. For of no\r\nmoment are the arguments for a simple straight motion toward the centre,\r\nthat this is the only kind in the Earth, and that in a simple body there is\r\none motion only and that a simple one. For that straight motion is only a\r\ntendency toward their own origin, not of the parts of the Earth only, but\r\nof those of the Sun also, of the Moon, and of the rest of the sphæres which\r\nalso move in an orbit. Joannes Costæus, who raises doubts concerning the\r\ncause of the Earth's motion, looking for it externally and internally,\r\nunderstands magnetick vigour to be internal, active, and disponent; also\r\nthat the Sun is an external promotive cause, and that the Earth is not so\r\nvile and abject a body as it is generally considered. Accordingly there is\r\na diurnal movement on the part of the Earth for its own sake and for its\r\nadvantage. Those who make out that that terrestrial motion (if such there\r\nbe) takes place not only in longitude, but also in latitude, talk nonsense.\r\nFor Nature has set in the Earth determinate poles, and definite unconfused\r\nrevolutions. Thus the Moon revolves with respect to the Sun in a monthly\r\ncourse; yet having her own definite poles, facing determinate parts of the\r\nheaven. To suppose that the air moves the Earth would be {228} ridiculous.\r\nFor air is only exhalation, and is an enveloping effluvium from the Earth\r\nitself; the winds also are only a rush of the exhalations in some part near\r\nthe Earth's surface; the height of its motion is slight, and in all regions\r\nthere are various winds unlike and contrary. Some writers, not finding in\r\nthe matter of the Earth the cause (for they say that they find nothing\r\nexcept solidity and consistency), deny it to be in its form; and they only\r\nadmit as qualities of the Earth cold and dryness, which are unable to move\r\nthe Earth. The Stoicks attribute a soul to the Earth, whence they pronounce\r\n(amid the laughter of the learned) the Earth to be an animal. This\r\nmagnetick form, whether vigour or soul, is astral. Let the learned lament\r\nand bewail the fact that none of those old Peripateticks, nor even those\r\ncommon philosophizers heretofore, nor Joannes Costæus, who mocks at such\r\nthings, were able to apprehend this grand and important natural fact. But\r\nas to the notion that surface inequality of mountains and valleys would\r\nprevent the Earth's diurnal revolution, there is nothing in it: for they do\r\nnot mar the Earth's roundness, being but slight excrescences compared with\r\nthe whole Earth; nor does the Earth revolve alone without its emanations.\r\nBeyond the emanations, there is no renitency. There is no more labour\r\nexerted in the Earth's motion than in the march of the rest of the Stars:\r\nnor is it excelled in dignity by some stars. To say that it is frivolous to\r\nsuppose that the Earth rather seeks a view of the Sun, than the Sun of the\r\nEarth, is a mark of great obstinacy and unwisdom. Of the theory of the\r\nrotation we have often spoken. If anyone seek the cause of the revolution,\r\nor of other tendency of the Earth, from the sea surrounding it, or from the\r\nmotion of the air, or from the Earth's gravity, he would be no less silly\r\nas a theorist than those who stubbornly ground their opinions on the\r\nsentiments of the ancients. Ptolemy's reasonings are of no weight; for when\r\nour true principles are laid down, the truth comes to light, and it is\r\nsuperfluous to refute them. Let Costæus recognize and philosophers see how\r\nunfruitful and vain a thing it becomes then to take one's stand on the\r\nprinciples and unproved opinions of certain ancients. Some raise a doubt\r\nhow it can be that, if the Earth move round its own axis, a globe of iron\r\nor of lead dropped from the highest point of a tower falls exactly\r\nperpendicularly to a spot of the Earth below itself. Also how it is that\r\ncannon balls from a large culverin, fired with the same quantity and\r\nstrength of powder, in the same direction and at a like elevation through\r\nthe same air, would be cast at a like distance from a given spot both\r\nEastward and Westward, supposing the Earth to move Eastward. But those who\r\nbring forward this kind of argument are being misled: not attending to the\r\nnature of primary globes, and the combination of parts with their globes,\r\neven though they be not adjoined by solid parts. Whereas the motion of the\r\nEarth in the diurnal revolution does not involve the separation of her more\r\n{229} solid circumference from the surrounding bodies; but all her effluvia\r\nsurround her, and in them heavy bodies projected in any way by force, move\r\non uniformly along with the Earth in general coherence. And this also takes\r\nplace in all primary bodies, the Sun, the Moon, the Earth, the parts\r\nbetaking themselves to their first origins and sources, with which they\r\nconnect themselves with the same appetence as terrene things, which we call\r\nheavy, with the Earth. So lunar things tend to the Moon, solar things to\r\nthe Sun, within the orbes of their own effluvia. The emanations hold\r\ntogether by continuity of substance, and heavy bodies are also united with\r\nthe Earth by their own gravity, and move on together in the general motion:\r\nespecially when there is no renitency of bodies in the way. And for this\r\ncause, on account of the Earth's diurnal revolution, bodies are neither set\r\nin motion, nor retarded; they do not overtake it, nor do they fall short\r\nbehind it when violently projected toward East or West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet E F G be the Earth's globe, A its centre, L E the ascending effluvia:\r\nJust as the orbe of the effluvia progresses with the Earth, so also does\r\nthe unmoved part of the circle at the straight line L E progress along with\r\nthe general revolution. At L and E, a heavy body, M, falls perpendicularly\r\ntoward E, taking the shortest way to the centre, nor is that right movement\r\nof weight, or of aggregation compounded with a circular movement, but is a\r\nsimple right motion, never leaving the line L E. But when thrown with an\r\nequal force from E toward F, and from E toward G, it completes an equal\r\ndistance on either side, even though the daily rotation of the Earth is in\r\nprocess: just as twenty paces of a man mark an equal space whether toward\r\nEast or West: so the Earth's diurnal motion {230} is by no means refuted by\r\nthe illustrious Tycho Brahe, through arguments such as these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration] The tendency toward its origin (which, in the case of the\r\nEarth, is called by Philosophers weight) causes no resistance to the\r\ndiurnal revolution, nor does it direct the Earth, nor does it retain the\r\nparts of the Earth in place, for in regard to the Earth's solidity they are\r\nimponderous, nor do they incline further, but are at rest in the mass. If\r\nthere be a flaw in the mass, such as a deep cavity (say 1000 fathoms), a\r\nhomogenic portion of the Earth, or compacted terrestrial matter, descends\r\nthrough that space (whether filled with water or air) toward an origin more\r\nassured than air or water, seeking a solid globe. But the centre of the\r\nEarth, as also the Earth as a whole, is imponderous; the separated parts\r\ntend toward their own origin, but that tendency we call weight; the parts\r\nunited are at rest; and even if they were ponderable, they would introduce\r\nno hindrance to the diurnal revolution. For if around the axis A B, there\r\nbe a weight at C, it is balanced from E; if at F, from G; if at H, from I.\r\nSo internally at L, they are balanced from M: the whole globe, then, having\r\na natural axis, is balanced in æquilibrio, and is easily set in motion by\r\nthe slighted cause, but especially because the Earth in her own place is\r\nnowise heavy nor lacking in balance. Therefore weight neither hinders the\r\ndiurnal revolution, nor influences either the direction or continuance in\r\nposition. Wherefore it is manifest that no sufficiently strong reason has\r\nyet been found out by Philosophers against the motion of the Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{231} CHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nOn the cause of the definite time, of an entire\r\n_rotation of the Earth._\r\n\r\nDiurnal motion is due to causes which have now to be sought, arising from\r\nmagnetick vigour and from the confederated bodies; that is to say, why the\r\ndiurnal rotation of the Earth is completed in the space of twenty-four\r\nhours. For no curious art, whether of Clepsydras or of sand-clocks, or\r\nthose contrivances of little toothed wheels which are set in motion by\r\nweights, or by the force of a bent steel band, can discover any degree of\r\ndifference in the time. But as soon as the diurnal rotation has been gone\r\nthrough, it at once begins over again. But we would take as the day the\r\nabsolute turning of a meridian of the Earth, from sun to sun. This is\r\nsomewhat greater than one whole revolution of it; in this way the yearly\r\ncourse is completed in 365 and nearly ¼ turnings with respect to the sun.\r\nFrom this sure and regular motion of the Earth, the number and time of 365\r\ndays, 5 hours, 55 minutes, in solar tropical years is always certain and\r\ndefinite, except that there are some slight differences due to other\r\ncauses. The Earth therefore revolves not fortuitously, or by chance, or\r\nprecipitately; but with a rather high intelligence, equably, and with a\r\nwondrous regularity, in no other way than all the rest of the movable\r\nstars, which have definite periods belonging to their motions. For the Sun\r\nhimself being the agent and incitor of the universe in motion, other\r\nwandering globes set within the range of his forces, when acted on and\r\nstirred, also regulate each its own proper courses by its own forces; and\r\nthey are turned about in periods corresponding to the extent of their\r\ngreater rotation, and the differences of their effused forces, and their\r\nintelligence for higher good. And for that cause Saturn, having a wider\r\norbit, is borne round it in a longer time, Jupiter a shorter, and Mars\r\nstill less; while Venus takes nine months, Mercury 80 days, on the\r\nhypotheses of Copernicus; the Moon going round the Earth with respect to\r\nthe Sun in 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes. We have asserted that the Earth\r\nmoves circularly about its centre, completing a day by an entire revolution\r\nwith respect to the Sun. The Moon revolves in a monthly course around the\r\nEarth, and, repeating a conjunction with the Sun after a former synodic\r\nconjunction, constitutes the month or Lunar day. The Moon's mean\r\nconcentrick orbit, according to numerous observations of Copernicus and\r\nlater astronomers, is found to be distant 29 and about 5/6 diameters of the\r\nEarth from the Earth's centre. The Moon's revolution with respect to the\r\nSun takes place in 29½ days and 44 minutes of time. We reckon the motion\r\nwith respect to the sun, not the periodic motion, {232} just as a day is\r\none entire revolution of the Earth with respect to the Sun, not one\r\nperiodick revolution; because the Sun is the cause of lunar as of\r\nterrestrial motion: also, because (on the hypotheses of later observers)\r\nthe synodical month is truly periodic, on account of the Earth's motion in\r\na great orbit. The proportion of diameters to circumferences is the same.\r\nAnd the concentrick orbit of the Moon contains twice over 29 and ½ great\r\ncircles of the Earth & a little more. The Moon & the Earth, then, agree\r\ntogether in a double proportion of motion; & the Earth moves in the space\r\nof twenty-four hours, in its diurnal motion; because the Moon has a motion\r\nproportional to the Earth, but the Earth a motion agreeing with the lunar\r\nmotion in a nearly double proportion. There is some difference in details,\r\nbecause the distances of the stars in details have not been examined\r\nsufficiently exactly, nor are mathematicians as yet agreed about them. The\r\nEarth therefore revolves in a space of 24 hours, as the Moon in her monthly\r\ncourse, by a magnetick confederation of both stars, the globes being\r\nforwarded in their movement by the Sun, according to the proportion of\r\ntheir orbits, as Aristotle allows, _de Coelo_, bk. ii., chap. 10. \"It\r\nhappens\" (he says) \"that the motions are performed through a proportion\r\nexisting between them severally, namely, at the same intervals in which\r\nsome are swifter, others slower,\" But it is more agreeable to the relation\r\nbetween the Moon and the Earth, that that harmony of motion should be due\r\nto the fact that they are bodies rather near together, and very like each\r\nother in nature and substance, and that the Moon has more evident effects\r\nupon the Earth than the rest of the stars, the Sun excepted; also because\r\nthe Moon alone of all the planets conducts her revolutions, directly\r\n(however diverse even), with reference to the Earth's centre, and is\r\nespecially akin to the Earth, and bound to it as with chains. This, then,\r\nis the true symmetry and harmony between the motions of the Earth and the\r\nMoon; not that old oft-besung harmony of coelestial motions, which assumes\r\nthat the nearer any sphære is to the _Primum Mobile_ and that fictitious\r\nand pretended rapidest Prime Motion, the less does it offer resistance\r\nthereto, and the slower it is borne by its own motion from west to east:\r\nbut that the more remote it is, the greater is its velocity, and the more\r\nfreely does it complete its own movement; and therefore that the Moon\r\n(being at the greatest distance from the _Primum Mobile_) revolves the most\r\nswiftly. Those vain tales have been conceded in order that the _Primum\r\nMobile_ may be accepted, and be thought to have certain effects in\r\nretarding the motions of the lower heavens; as though the motion of the\r\nstars arose from retardation, and were not inherent and natural; and as\r\nthough a furious force were perpetually driving the rest of the heaven\r\n(except only the _Primum Mobile_) with frenzied incitations. Much more\r\nlikely is it that the stars are borne around symmetrically by their own\r\nforces, with a certain mutual concert and harmony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{233} CHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nOn the primary magnetick nature of the Earth,\r\nwhereby its poles are parted from the poles\r\n_of the Ecliptick._\r\n\r\nPrimarily having shown the manner and causes of the diurnal revolution of\r\nthe Earth, which is partly brought about from the vigour of the magnetick\r\nvirtue, partly effected by the præ-eminence and light of the Sun; there now\r\nfollows an account of the distance of its poles from the poles of the\r\nEcliptick--a supremely necessary fact. For if the poles of the universe or\r\nof the Earth remained fast at the poles of the Zodiack, then the Æquator of\r\nthe Earth would lie exactly beneath the line of the Ecliptick, and there\r\nwould be no variation in the seasons of the year, no Winter, no Summer, nor\r\nSpring, nor Autumn: but one and the same invariable aspect of things would\r\ncontinue. The direction of the axis of the Earth has receded therefore from\r\nthe pole of the Zodiack (for lasting good) just so far as is sufficient for\r\nthe generation and variety of things. Accordingly the declination of the\r\ntropicks and the inclination of the Earth's pole remain perpetually in the\r\ntwenty-fourth degree; though now only 23 degrees 28 minutes are counted;\r\nor, as others make out, 29 minutes: But once it was 23 degrees 52 minutes,\r\nwhich are the extreme limits of the declinations hitherto observed. And\r\nthat has been prudently ordained by nature, and is arranged by the primary\r\nexcellence of the Earth. For if those poles (of the Earth and the\r\nEcliptick) were to be parted by a much greater distance, then when the Sun\r\napproached the tropick, all things in the other deserted part of the globe,\r\nin some higher latitude, would be desolate and (by reason of the too\r\nprolonged absence of the Sun) brought to destruction. As it is, however,\r\nall is so proportioned that the whole terrestrial globe has its own varying\r\nseasons in succession, and alternations of condition, appropriate and\r\nneedful: either from the more direct and vertical radiation of light, or\r\nfrom its increased tarriance above the horizon.\r\n\r\nAround these poles of the Ecliptick the direction of the poles of the Earth\r\nis borne: and by this motion the præcession of the æquinoxes is apparent to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{234} CHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nOn the Præcession of the Æquinoxes, from the magnetick\r\nmotion of the poles of the Earth, in the Arctick\r\n_and Antarctick circle of the Zodiack._\r\n\r\nPrimitive mathematicians, since they did not pay attention to the\r\ninequælities of the years, made no distinction between the æquinoctial, or\r\nsolstitial revolving year, and that which is taken from some one of the\r\nfixed stars. Even the Olympick years, which they used to reckon from the\r\nrising of the dogstar, they thought to be the same as those counted from\r\nthe solstice. Hipparchus of Rhodes was the first to call attention to the\r\nfact that these differ from each other, and discovered that the year was\r\nlonger when measured by the fixed stars than by the æquinox or solstice:\r\nwhence he supposed that there was in the fixed stars also some motion in a\r\ncommon sequence; but very slow, and not at once perceptible. After him\r\nMenelaus, a Roman geometer, then Ptolemy, and long afterward Mahometes\r\nAractensis, and several more, in all their literary memoirs, perceived that\r\nthe fixed stars and the whole firmament proceeded in an orderly sequence,\r\nregarding as they did the heaven, not the earth, and not understanding the\r\nmagnetical inclinations. But we shall demomstrate that it proceeds rather\r\nfrom a certain rotatory motion of the Earth's axis, than that that eighth\r\nsphære (so called) the firmament, or non-moving empyrean, revolves studded\r\nwith innumerable globes and stars, whose distances from the Earth have\r\nnever been proved by anyone, nor can be proved (the whole universe gliding,\r\nas it were). And surely it should seem much more likely that the\r\nappearances in the heavens should be clearly accounted for by a certain\r\ninflection and inclination of the comparatively small body of the Earth,\r\nthan by the setting in motion of the whole system of the universe;\r\nespecially if this motion is to be regarded as ordained solely for the\r\nEarth's advantage: While for the fixed stars, or for the planets, it is of\r\nno use at all. For this motion the rising and settings of stars in every\r\nHorizon, as well as their culminations at the height of the heavens, are\r\nshifted so much that the stars which once were vertical are now some\r\ndegrees distant from the zenith. For nature has taken care, through the\r\nEarth's soul or magnetick vigour, that, just as it was needful in\r\ntempering, receiving, and warding off the sun's rays and light, by suitable\r\nseasons, that the points toward which the Earth's pole is directed should\r\nbe 23 degrees and more {235} from the poles of the Ecliptick[250]: so now\r\nfor moderating and for receiving the luminous rays of the fixed stars in\r\ndue turn and succession, the Earth's poles should revolve at the same\r\ndistance from the Ecliptick at the Ecliptick's arctick circle; or rather\r\nthat they should creep at a gentle pace, that the actions of the stars\r\nshould not always remain at the same parallel circles, but should have a\r\nrather slow mutation. For the influences of the stars are not so forceful\r\nas that a swifter course should be desired. Slowly, then, is the Earth's\r\naxis inflected; and the stars' rays, falling upon the face of the Earth,\r\nshift only in so long a time as a diameter of the arctick or polar circle\r\nis extended: whence the star at the extremity of the tail of the Cynosure,\r\nwhich once was 12 degrees 24 minutes (namely, in the time of Hipparchus)\r\ndistant from the pole of the universe, or from that point which the pole of\r\nthe Earth used to face, is now only 2 degrees and 52 minutes distant from\r\nthe same point; whence from its nearness it is called by the moderns\r\n_Polaris._ Some time it will be only ½ degree away from the pole: afterward\r\nit will begin to recede from the pole until it will be 48 degrees distant;\r\nand this, according to the Prutenical tables, will be in Anno Domini 15000.\r\nThus _Lucida Lyræ_ (which to us southern Britons now almost culminates)\r\nwill some time approach to the pole of the world, to about the fifth\r\ndegree. So all the stars shift their rays of light at the surface of the\r\nEarth, through this wonderful magnetical inflection of the Earth's axis.\r\nHence come new varieties of the seasons of the year, and lands become more\r\nfruitful or more barren; hence the characters and manners of nations are\r\nchanged; kingdoms and laws are altered, in accordance with the virtue of\r\nthe fixed stars as they culminate, and the strength thence received or lost\r\nin accordance with the singular and specifick nature of each; or on account\r\nof new configurations with the planets in other places of the Zodiack; on\r\naccount also of risings and settings, and of new concurrences at the\r\nmeridian. The Præcession of the æquinoxes arising from the aequable motion\r\nof the Earth's pole in the arctick circle of the Zodiack is here\r\ndemonstrated. Let A B C D be the Ecliptick line; I E G the arctic circle of\r\nthe Zodiack. Then if the Earth's pole look to E, the æquinoxes are at D, C.\r\nLet this be at the time of Metho, when the horns of Aries were in the\r\næquinoctial colure. Now if the Earth's pole have advanced to I; then the\r\næquinoxes will be at K, L; and the stars in the ecliptick C will seem to\r\nhave progressed, in the order of the signs, along the whole arc K C: L will\r\nbe moved on by the præcession, against the order of the signs, along the\r\narc D L. But this would occur in the contrary order, if the point G were to\r\nface the poles of the earth, and the motion were from E to G: for then the\r\næquinoxes would be M N, and the fixed stars would anticipate the same at C\r\nand D, counter to the order of the signs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{236} CHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nOn the anomaly of the Præcession of the Equinoxes,\r\n_and of the obliquity of the Zodiack._\r\n\r\nAt one time the shifting of the æquinoxes is quicker, at another slower,\r\nbeing not always equal: because the poles of the earth travel unequally in\r\nthe arctick and antarctick circle of the Zodiack; and decline on both sides\r\nfrom the middle path: whence the obliquity of the Zodiack to the Æquator\r\nseems to change. And as this has become known by means of long\r\nobservations, so also has it been perceived, that the true æquinoctial\r\npoints have been elongated from the mean æquinoctial points, on this side\r\nand on that, by 70 minutes (when the prostaphæresis is greatest): but that\r\nthe solstices either approach the equator unequally 12 minutes nearer, or\r\nrecede as far behind; so that the nearest approach is 23 degrees 28\r\nminutes, and the greatest elongation 23 degrees 52 minutes. Astronomers\r\nhave given various explanations to account for this inequality of the\r\npræcession and also of the obliquity of the tropicks. Thebit, with the view\r\nof {237} laying down a rule for such considerable inequalities in the\r\nmotion of the stars, explained that the eighth sphære does not move with a\r\ncontinuous motion from west to east; but is shaken with a certain motion of\r\ntrepidation, by which the first points of Aries and Libra in the eighth\r\nheaven describe certain small circles with diameters equal to about nine\r\ndegrees, around the first points of Aries and Libra in the ninth sphære.\r\nBut since many things absurd and impossible as to motion follow from this\r\nmotion of trepidation, that theory of motion is therefore long since\r\nobsolete. Others therefore are compelled to attribute the motion to the\r\neighth sphære, and to erect above it a ninth heaven also, yea, and to pile\r\nup yet a tenth and an eleventh: In the case of mathematicians, indeed, the\r\nfault may be condoned; for it is permissible for them, in the case of\r\ndifficult motions, to lay down some rule and law of equality by any\r\nhypotheses. But by no means can such enormous and monstrous celestial\r\nstructures be accepted by philosophers. And yet here one may see how hard\r\nto please are those who do not allow any motion to one very small body, the\r\nEarth; and notwithstanding they drive and rotate the heavens, which are\r\nhuge and immense above all conception and imagination: I declare that they\r\nfeign the heavens to be three (the most monstrous of all things in Nature)\r\nin order that some obscure motions forsooth[251] may be accounted for.\r\nPtolemy, who compares with his own the observations of Timocharis and\r\nHipparchus, one of whom flourished 260 years, the other 460 years before\r\nhim, thought that there was this motion of the eighth sphære, and of the\r\nwhole firmament; and proved by help of numerous phenomena that it took\r\nplace over the poles of the Zodiack, and, supposing its motion to be so far\r\næquable, that the non-planetary stars in the space of 100 years completed\r\njust one degree beneath the _Primum Mobile_. After him 750 years\r\nAlbategnius discovered that one degree was completed in a space of 66\r\nyears, so that a whole period would be 23,760 years. Alphonsus made out\r\nthat this motion was still slower, completing one degree and 28 minutes\r\nonly in 200 years; and that thus the course of the fixed stars went on,\r\nthough unequally. At length Copernicus, by means of the observations of\r\nTimocharis, Aristarchus of Samos, Hipparchus, Menelaus, Ptolemy, Mahometes\r\nAractensis, Alphonsus, and of his own, detected the anomalies of the motion\r\nof the Earth's axis: though I doubt not that other anomalies also will come\r\nto light some ages hence. So difficult is it to observe motion so slow,\r\nunless extending over a period of many centuries; on which account we still\r\nfail to understand the intent of Nature, what she is driving after through\r\nsuch inequality of motion. Let A be the pole of the Ecliptick, B C the\r\nEcliptick, D the Æquator; when the pole of the Earth near the arctick\r\ncircle of the Zodiack faces the point M, then there is an anomaly of the\r\npræcession of the æquinox at F; {238} but when it faces N, there is an\r\nanomaly of the præcession at E. But when it faces I directly, then the\r\nmaximum obliquity G is observed at the solstitial colure; but when it faces\r\nL, there is the minimum obliquity H at the solstitial colure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_Copernicus' contorted circlet in the Arctick circle of the Zodiack._\r\n\r\nLet F B G be the half of the Arctick circle described round the pole of the\r\nZodiack: A B C the solstitial colure: A the pole of the Zodiack; D E the\r\nanomaly of longitude 140 minutes at either side on both ends: B C the\r\nanomaly of obliquity 24 minutes: B the greater obliquity of 23 degrees 52\r\nminutes: D the mean obliquity of 23 degrees 40 minutes: C the minimum\r\nobliquity of 23 degrees 28 minutes.\r\n\r\n{239} [Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{240} The period of motion of the præcession of the æquinoxes is 25,816\r\nÆgyptian years; the period of the obliquity of the Zodiack is 3434 years,\r\nand a little more. The period of the anomaly of the præcession of the\r\næquinoxes is 1717 years, and a little more. If the whole time of the motion\r\nAI were divided into eight equal parts: in the first eighth the pole is\r\nborne somewhat swiftly from A to B; in the second eighth, more slowly from\r\nB to C; in the third, with the same slowness from C to D; in the fourth,\r\nmore swiftly again from D to E; in the fifth, with the same swiftness from\r\nE to F; again more slowly from F to G; and with the same slowness from G to\r\nH; in the last eighth, somewhat swiftly again from H to I. And this is the\r\ncontorted circlet of Copernicus, fused with the mean motion into the curved\r\nline which is the path of the true motion. And thus the pole attains the\r\nperiod of the anomaly of the præcession of the æquinoxes twice; and that of\r\nthe declination or obliquity once only. It is thus that by later\r\nastronomers, but especially by Copernicus (the Restorer of Astronomy)[252],\r\nthe anomalies of the motion of the Earth's axis are described, so far as\r\nthe observations of the ancients down to our own times admit; but there are\r\nstill needed more and exact observations for anyone to establish aught\r\ncertain about the anomaly of the motion of the præcessions, and at the same\r\ntime that also of the obliquity of the Zodiack. For ever since the time at\r\nwhich, by means of various observations, this anomaly was first observed,\r\nwe have only arrived at half a period of the obliquity. So that all the\r\nmore all these matters about the unequal motion both of the præcession and\r\nof the obliquity are uncertain and not well known: wherefore neither can we\r\nourselves assign any natural causes for it, and establish it for certain.\r\nWherefore also do we to our reasonings and experiments magnetical here set\r\nan end and period.[253]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{241}\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n  Abano, Pietro di (Apponensis or Apianus), 2.\r\n  Abbas, Hali ('Alí ibn Al 'Abb[=a]s, _Al Majúsi_, 2, 6.\r\n  Abohalis, 47. _See also_ Avicenna.\r\n  _aciarium_ or _acies_, also _aciare_, 18, 23, 33, 36.\r\n  Acosta, Josephus, 5.\r\n  adamant, 11.\r\n  æquator, the magnetick, 13, 79.\r\n  Aetius Amidenus, 2.\r\n  Affaytatus, Fortunius, 6.\r\n  agate, non electrick, 51, 53.\r\n  Agricola, Georgius, 2, 3, 10, 19, 26, 111, 112.\r\n  Agrippa, H.

WILLIAM GILBERT.\r\n\r\nDuring the work of revising and editing the English translation of _De\r\nMagnete_, many points came up for discussion, requiring critical\r\nconsideration, and the examination of the writings of contemporary or\r\nearlier authorities. Discrepancies between the texts of the three known\r\neditions--the London folio of 1600, and the two Stettin quartos of 1628 and\r\n1633 respectively--demanded investigation. Passages relating to astrology,\r\nto pharmacy, to alchemy, to geography, and to navigation, required to be\r\nreferred to persons acquainted with the early literature of those branches.\r\nPhrases of non-classical Latin, presenting some obscurity, needed\r\nexplanation by scholars of mediæval writings. Descriptions of magnetical\r\nexperiments needed to be interpreted by persons whose knowledge of\r\nmagnetism enabled them to infer the correct meaning to be assigned to the\r\nwords in the text. In this wise a large amount of miscellaneous criticism\r\nhas been brought to bear, and forms the basis for the following notes. To\r\nmake them available to all students of Gilbert, the references are given to\r\npage and line both of the Latin folio of 1600 and of the English edition of\r\n1900. S. P. T.\r\n\r\n[1] _THE GLOSSARY:_\r\n\r\nGilbert's glossary is practically an apology for the introduction into the\r\nLatin language of certain new words, such as the nouns _terrella_,\r\n_versorium_, and _verticitas_, and the adjectival noun _magneticum_, which\r\neither did not exist in classical Latin or had not the technical meaning\r\nwhich he now assigns to them. His _terrella_, or [Greek: mikrogê], as he\r\nexplains in detail on p. 13, is a little magnetic model of the earth, but\r\nin the glossary he simply defines it as _magnes globosus_. Neither\r\n_terrella_ nor _versorium_ appears in any Latin dictionary. No older writer\r\nhad used either word, though Peter Peregrinus (_De Magnete_, Augsburg,\r\n1558) had described experiments with globular loadstones, and pivotted\r\nmagnetic needles suitable for use in a compass had been known for nearly\r\nthree centuries. Yet the pivotted needle was not denominated _versorium_.\r\nBlondo (_De Ventis_, Venice, 1546) does not use the term. Norman (_The Newe\r\nAttractiue_, London, 1581) speaks of the \"needle or compasse,\" and of the\r\n\"wyre.\" Barlowe (_The Navigators Supply_, London, 1597) speaks of {2} the\r\n\"flie,\" or the \"wier.\" The term _versorium_ (literally, the _turn-about_)\r\nis Gilbert's own invention. It was at once adopted into the science, and\r\nappears in the treatises of Cabeus, _Philosophia Magnetica_ (Ferrara,\r\n1629), and of Kircher, _Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica_ (Coloniæ, 1643), and\r\nother writers of the seventeenth century. Curiously enough, its adoption to\r\ndenote the pivotted magnetic needle led to the growth of an erroneous\r\nsuggestion that the mariners' compass was known to the ancients because of\r\nthe occurrence in the writings of Plautus of the term _versoriam_, or\r\n_vorsoriam_. This appears twice as the accusative case of a feminine noun\r\n_versoria_, or _vorsoria_, which was used to denote part of the gear of a\r\nship used in tacking-about. Forcellini defines _versoria_ as \"funiculus quo\r\nextremus veli angulus religatur\"; while _versoriam capere_ is equivalent to\r\n\"reverti,\" or (metaphorically) \"sententiam mutare.\" The two passages in\r\nPlautus are:\r\n\r\n  EUT.  Si huc item properes, ut istuc properas, facias rectius,\r\n        Huc secundus ventus nunc est; cape modo vorsoriam;\r\n        Hic Favonius serenu'st, istic Auster imbricus:\r\n        Hic facit tranquillitatem, iste omnes fluctus conciet.\r\n              (in _Mercat._ Act. V., sc. 2.)\r\n\r\n  CHARM.  Stasime, fac te propere celerem recipe te ad dominum domum;\r\n          . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n          . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n          . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Cape vorsoriam\r\n          Recipe te ad herum.\r\n              (in _Trinum._ Act. IV., sc. 3.)\r\n\r\nThe word _magneticum_ is also of Gilbert's own coinage, as a noun; as an\r\nadjective it had been certainly used before, at least in its English form,\r\n_magneticall_, which appears on the title-page of William Borough's\r\n_Discourse of the Variation of the Compasse_ (London, 1596). Gilbert does\r\nnot use anywhere the noun _magnetismus_, _magnetism_. The first use of that\r\nnoun occurs in William Barlowe's _Magneticall Aduertisements_ (1616), in\r\nthe _Epistle Dedicatorie_, wherein, when speaking of Dr. Gilbert, he says\r\n\"vnto whom I communicated what I had obserued of my selfe, and what I had\r\nbuilt vpon his foundation of the _Magnetisme_ of the earth.\" Gilbert speaks\r\nof the _virtus magnetica_, or _vis magnetica_; indeed, he has a rich\r\nvocabulary of terms, using, beside _virtus_ and _vis_, _vires_, _robur_,\r\n_potestas_, _potentia_, _efficientia_, and _vigor_ for that which we should\r\nnow call _magnetism_ or _the magnetic forces_. Nor does he use the verb\r\n_magnetisare_, or its participle, _magnetisatus_: he speaks of _ferrum\r\ntactum_, or of _ferrum excitatum a magnete_. In spite of certain\r\nobscurities which occur in places in his work, he certainly shows a nice\r\nappreciation of words and their use, and a knowledge of style. One finds\r\noccasionally direct quotations from, and overt references to, the classic\r\nauthors, as in the references to Plato and Aristotle on page 1, and in the\r\npassage from the Georgics of Vergil on p. 21. But here and there one finds\r\nother traces of unmistakable scholarship, as in the reference to goat's\r\nwool on p. 35, or in the use, on p. 210, of the word _perplacet_, which\r\noccurs in the letter of Cicero _ad Atticum_, or in that of _commonstrabit_,\r\noccurring on p. 203, and found only in Cicero, Terence and Plautus; whilst\r\nthe phrase on p. 3, in which Gilbert rallies the smatterers on having lost\r\nboth their oil and their pains, has a delightfully classical echo. {3} The\r\nterm _orbis virtutis_, defined by Gilbert in the glossary, and illustrated\r\nby the cuts on pages 76, 77, and 96, might be effectively translated by\r\n_sphere of influence_, or _orbit within which there is sensible\r\nattraction_. It has been preferred, however, to translate it literally as\r\nthe _orbe of virtue_, or _orbe of magnetick virtue_. This choice has been\r\ndetermined by the desire to adopt such an English phrase as Gilbert would\r\nhimself have used had he been writing English. T. Hood, writing in 1592 in\r\nhis book _The Vse of both the Globes_, in using the word _orbe_, says that\r\nthe word _globe_ signifies a solid body, while a _sphere_ is hollow, like\r\ntwo \"dishes joyned by the brimme\"; \"The Latines properly call _Orbis_ an\r\nOrbe\"; \"Moreouer the word _Sphaera_ signifieth that instrument made of\r\nbrasen hoopes (wee call it commonly a ringed Sphere) wherewith the\r\nAstronomers deliuer unto the nouices of that Science the vnderstanding of\r\nthings which they imagine in the heauen.\" Further, Dr. Marke Ridley in his\r\n_Treatise of Magneticall Bodies and Motions_ (1613), has a chapter (XIIII)\r\n\"Of the distance and Orbe of the Magnets vertue,\" throughout which the term\r\nOrbe is retained. Sir Thomas Browne also writes of \"the orb of their\r\nactivities.\"\r\n\r\nThe word _Coitio_, used by Gilbert for the mutual force between magnet and\r\niron, has been retained in its English form, _coition_. Gilbert evidently\r\nadopted this term after much thought. The Newtonian conception of action\r\nand reaction being necessarily equal had not dawned upon the mediæval\r\nphilosophers. The term _attraction_ had been used in a limited sense to\r\nconnote an action in which a force was conceived of as being exerted on one\r\nside only. Diogenes of Apollonia, Alexander Aphrodiseus, Democritus, and\r\nothers, conceived the magnet to draw at the iron without the iron in any\r\nway contributing to that action. Saint Basil specially affirms that the\r\nmagnet is not drawn by iron. On the other hand, Albertus Magnus had\r\nconceived the idea that the iron sought the magnet by a one-sided effort in\r\nwhich the magnet took no part. Gilbert had the wit to discern that the\r\naction was mutual, and to mark the new conception he adopted the new term,\r\nand defined it as it stands in his glossary. It is \"a concourse or\r\nconcordancy of both,\" and to emphasize his meaning he adds, \"not as if\r\nthere were an [Greek: helktikê dunamis] but a [Greek: sundromê]\" not a\r\ntractile power, but a running together. The adjective [Greek: helktikê] is\r\nobviously related to the verb [Greek: helkô], I draw: but its meaning\r\npuzzled the subsequent editors of the text, for in the two Stettin editions\r\nof 1628 and 1633, the phrase appears in the respective forms of [Greek:\r\nhelêtikê dunamis] and [Greek: helkustikê dunamis]. In Creech's English\r\nversion of Lucretius (edition of 1722, p. 72a, in the footnote) is the\r\ncommentary \"Galen, disputing against Epicurus, uses the term [Greek:\r\nhelkein], which seems likewise too violent.\" It may be noted that the same\r\nverb occurs in the passage from the _Io_ of Plato quoted below. The term\r\n[Greek: sundromê] applied by Gilbert to explain his term _Coitio_ is used\r\nby Diodorus for the mutual onset of two hostile forces.\r\n\r\nA picturesque sentence from Sir Thomas Browne's _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_\r\n(London, 1650, p. 51) sets the matter succinctly forth. \"If in two skiffs\r\nof cork, a Loadstone and Steel be placed within the orb of their\r\nactivities, the one doth not move the other standing still, but both hoist\r\nsayle and steer unto each other; so that if the Loadstone attract, the\r\nSteel hath also its attraction; for in this action the Alliency is\r\nreciprocall, which jointly felt, they mutually approach and run into each\r\nothers arms.\" {4} The page and line references given in these notes are in\r\nall cases first to the Latin edition of 1600, and secondly to the English\r\nedition of 1900.\r\n\r\n[2] PAGE 1, LINE 28. Page 1, line 28. _Plato in Ione._--The passage in the\r\n_Io_ of Plato is in chap. v. Socrates addressing the poet Io tells him that\r\nhis facility in reciting Homer is not really an art: [Greek: theia de\r\ndunamis, hê se kinei hôsper en têi lithôi, hên Euripidês men Magnêtin\r\nônomasen, hoi de polloi Hêrakleian. kai gar autê hê lithos ou monon autous\r\ntous daktulious agei tous sidêrous, alla kai dunamin entithêsi tois\r\ndaktuliois, ôst au dunasthai tautou touto poiein, hoper hê lithos, allous\r\nagein daktulious, hôst' enioth' hormathos makros panu sidêriôn kai\r\ndaktuliôn ex allêlôn êrtêtai pasi de toutois ex ekeinês tês lithou hê\r\ndunamis anêrtêtai.] The idea is that as the loadstone in attracting an iron\r\nring will make it into a magnet, which can in turn act magnetically on\r\nanother ring, and this on yet another, so the inspiration of the Muse is\r\ntransferred to the poet, who in turn hands on the inspiration through the\r\nreciter to the listener. After further expanding the same idea of the\r\ntransference of influence, Socrates again mentions the magnet (chap. vii.):\r\n[Greek: Oisth' oun hoti outos estin ho theatês tôn daktuliôn ho eschatos,\r\nhôn egô elegon hupo tês Hêrakleiôtidos lithou ap' allêlôn tên dunamin\r\nlambanein, ho de mesos su ho rhapsôdos kai hupokritês, ho de prôtos autos\r\nho poiêtês? ho de theos dia pantôn toutôn helkei tên psuchên hopoi an\r\nboulêtai tôn anthrôpôn, k.t.l.] (Edition Didot of 1856, vol. i., p. 391; or\r\nStephanus, p. 533 D).\r\n\r\nThere is another reference in Plato to the magnet, namely, in the _Timæus_\r\n(p. 240, vol. ii., Edit. citat.). See the Note to p. 61.\r\n\r\nThe reference by Euripides to the magnet occurs in the lost play of Oeneus,\r\nin a fragment preserved by Suidas. See _Fragmenta Euripidis_ (Ed. Didot,\r\n1846, p. 757, or Nauck's edition, No. 567).\r\n\r\n[Greek: hôs Euripidês en Oinei; tas brotôn gnômas skopôn, hôste Magnêtis\r\nlithos tên doxan helkei kai methistêsin palin.]\r\n\r\n[3] PAGE 1, LINE 28. Page 1, line 29. The brief passage from Aristotle's\r\n_De Anima_ referring to Thales is quoted by Gilbert himself at the bottom\r\nof p. 11.\r\n\r\n[4] PAGE 2, LINE 1. Page 1, line 29. The edition of 1628 inserts commas\r\nbetween Theophrastus and Lesbius, and between Julius and Solinus, as though\r\nthese were four persons instead of two.\r\n\r\n[5] PAGE 2, LINE 8. Page 2, line 5. _si allio magnes illitus fuerit, aut si\r\nadamas fuerit_. An excellent version of this myth is to be found in Julius\r\nSolinus, _Polyhistor, De Memorabilibus_, chap. lxiv., of which the English\r\nversion of 1587, by A. Golding, runs thus: \"The Diamonde will not suffer\r\nthe Lodestone to drawe yron unto him: or if y^e Lodestone haue alreadie\r\ndrawne a peece of yron to it, the Diamond snatcheth and pulleth away as hys\r\nbootye whatsoever the Lodestone hath taken hold of.\" Saint Augustine\r\nrepeats the diamond myth in his _De Civitate Dei_, lib. xxi. Baptista Porta\r\nsays (p. 211 of the English version of 1658): \"It is a common Opinion\r\namongst Sea-men, That Onyons and Garlick are at odds with the Loadstone:\r\nand Steers-men, and such as tend the Mariners Card are forbid to eat Onyons\r\nor Garlick, lest they make the Index of the Poles drunk. But when I tried\r\nall these things, found them to be false: for not onely breathing and\r\nbelching upon the Loadstone after eating of Garlick, did not stop its\r\nvertues: but when it was all anoynted over with the juice of Garlick, it\r\ndid perform its office as well as if it had never been touched with it: and\r\nI could observe almost not the least difference, lest I should make void\r\nthe endeavours of the Ancients. {5} And again, When I enquired of Marines,\r\nwhether it were so, that they were forbid to eat Onyons and Garlick for\r\nthat reason; they said, they were old Wives fables, and things ridiculous;\r\nand that Sea-men would sooner lose their lives, then abstain from eating\r\nOnyons and Garlick.\"\r\n\r\nThe fables respecting the antipathy of garlick and of the diamond to the\r\noperation of the magnet, although already discredited by Ruellius and by\r\nPorta, died hard. In spite of the exposure and denunciations of\r\nGilbert--compare p. 32--these tales were oft repeated during the succeeding\r\ncentury. In the appendix to Sir Hugh Plat's _Jewel House of Art and\r\nNature_, in the edition of 1653, by D. B. Gent, it is stated there (p.\r\n218): \"The Loadstone which ... hath an admirable vertue not onely to draw\r\nIron to it self, but also to make any Iron upon which it is rubbed to draw\r\niron also, it is written notwithstanding, that being rubbed with the juyce\r\nof Garlick, it loseth that vertue, and cannot then draw iron, as likewise\r\nif a Diamond be layed close unto it.\"\r\n\r\nPliny wrote of the alleged antipathy between diamond and goat's blood. The\r\npassage as quoted from the English version of Pliny's _Natural Historie of\r\nthe World_, translated by Philemon Holland (London, 1601, p. 610, chap,\r\niv.), runs: \"But I would gladly know whose invention this might be to soake\r\nthe Diamond in Goats bloud, whose head devised it first, or rather by what\r\nchance was it found out and knowne? What conjecture should lead a man to\r\nmake an experiment of such a singular and admirable secret, especially in a\r\ngoat, the filthiest beast ... in the whole world? Certes I must ascribe\r\nboth this invention and all such like to the might and beneficence together\r\nof the divine powers: neither are we to argue and reason how and why Nature\r\nhath done this or that? Sufficient is it that her will was so, and thus she\r\nwould have it.\"\r\n\r\n[6] PAGE 2, LINE 22. Page 2, line 22. _Machometis sacellum._ Gilbert\r\ncredits Matthiolus (the well-known herbalist and commentator on\r\nDioscorides) with producing the fable as to Mahomet's coffin being\r\nsuspended in the air by a magnet. Sir Richard Burton, in his famous\r\npilgrimage to El Medïnah in 1855, effectually disposed of this myth. The\r\nreputed sarcophagus rests simply on bricks on the floor. But it had long\r\nbeen known that aerial suspension, even of the lightest iron object, in the\r\nair, without contact above or below, was impossible by any magnetic agency.\r\n\r\nIn Barlowe's _Magneticall Aduertisements_ (London, 1616, p. 45) is the\r\nfollowing: \"As for the Turkes _Mahomet_, hanging in the ayer with his yron\r\nchest it is a most grosse untruth, and utterly impossible it is for any\r\nthing to hange in the ayer by any _magneticall_ power, but that either it\r\nmust touch the stone it selfe, or else some intermediate body, that\r\nhindreth it from comming to the stone (like as before I haue shewed) or\r\nelse some stay below to keepe it from ascending, as some small wier that\r\nmay scantly bee seene or perceived.\"\r\n\r\n[7] PAGE 2, LINE 26. Page 2, line 26. _Arsinoes templum._--The account in\r\nPliny of the magnetic suspension of the statue of Arsinoe in the temple\r\nbuilt by Chinocrates is given as follows in the English version (London,\r\n1601) of Philemon Holland (p. 515): \"And here I cannot chuse but acquaint\r\nyou with the singular invention of that great architect and master deviser,\r\nof Alexandria in Ægypt _Dinocrates_, who began to make the arched roufe of\r\nthe temple of _Arsinoe_ all of Magnet or this Loadstone, to the end, that\r\nwithin that temple the statue of the said princesse made of yron, might\r\nseeme to hang in the aire by nothing.

The very meagre accounts they have left, and the\r\nscattered references to the reputed magical powers of the loadstone,\r\nsuggest that there existed amongst the primitive religions of mankind a\r\n_magnet-worship_, of which these records are traces.\r\n\r\n[8] PAGE 2, LINE 37.

Indeed the few passages in Paracelsus on the magnet\r\nare sorry stuff. They will mostly be found in the seventh volume of his\r\ncollected works (_Opera omnia_, Frankfurt, 1603). A sample may be taken\r\nfrom the English work publisht in London, 1650, with the title: _Of the\r\nNature of Things, Nine Books; written by Philipp Theophrastus of Hohenheim,\r\ncalled Paracelsvs_.\r\n\r\n\"For any Loadstone that Mercury hath but touched, or which hath been\r\nsmeered with Mercuriall oyle, or only put into Mercury will never draw Iron\r\nmore\" (p. 23).\r\n\r\n\"The life of the Loadstone is the spirit of Iron; which may bee extracted,\r\nand taken away with spirit of Wine\" (p. 32).\r\n\r\n[11] PAGE 3, LINE 13.

This is written in a singular\r\nmedley of Latin and German. Gilbert undoubtedly took from it many of his\r\nideas about the properties of metals. See the note to p. 27 on _plumbum\r\nalbum_.\r\n\r\n[12] PAGE 3, LINE 20. Page 3, line 21. _Thomas Aquinas._--The reference is\r\nto his commentaries upon the _Physica_ of Aristotle.

Page 3, line 45. _pyxidem._--The word _pyxis_, which\r\noccurs here, and in the next sentence as _pyxidem nauticam_, is translated\r\n_compass_. Eleven lines lower occurs the term _nautica pyxidula_. This\r\nlatter word, literally the \"little compass,\" certainly refers to the\r\nportable compass used at sea. Compare several passages in Book IV. where a\r\ncontrasting use is made of these terms; for example, on pp. 177 and 202.\r\nCalcagninus, _De re nautica_, uses the term _pyxidecula_ for an instrument\r\nwhich he describes as \"vitro intecta.\" On p. 152, line 9, Gilbert uses the\r\nnon-classical noun _compassus_, \"boreale lilium compassi (quod Boream\r\nrespicit),\" and again on p. 178, line 3.\r\n\r\n[14] PAGE 4, LINE 2. Page 4, line 2. _Melphitani._--The inhabitants of\r\nAmalfi in the kingdom of Naples. The claim of the discovery or invention of\r\nthe mariners' compass in the year 1302 by one Joannes Goia, or Gioia, also\r\nnamed as Flavio Goia, has been much disputed. In Guthrie's _New System of\r\nModern Geography_ (London, 1792, p. 1036), in the Chronology, is set down\r\nfor the year 1302:\r\n\r\n\"The mariner's compass invented, or improved by Givia, of Naples. The\r\nflower de luce, the arms of the Duke of Anjou, then King of Naples, was\r\nplaced by him at the point of the needle, in compliment to that prince.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1808 an elaborate treatise was printed at Naples, by Flaminius Venanson\r\nwith the title, _De l'invention de la Boussole Nautique_. Venanson, who\r\ncites many authorities, endeavours to prove that if Gioia did not discover\r\nmagnetic polarity he at least invented the compass, that is to say, he\r\npivotted the magnetic needle and placed it in a box, with a card affixed\r\nabove it divided into sixteen parts bearing the names of the sixteen\r\nprincipal winds. He alleges in proof that the compass-card is emblazoned in\r\nthe armorial bearings of the city of Amalfi. This view was combatted in the\r\nfamous letter of Klaproth to Humboldt publisht in Paris in 1834. He shows\r\nthat the use of the magnetized needle was known in Europe toward the end of\r\nthe twelfth century; that the Chinese knew of it and used it for finding\r\nthe way on land still earlier; that there is no compass-card in the arms of\r\nthe city of Amalfi; but he concedes that Gioia may have improved the\r\ncompass in 1302 by adding the wind-rose card. The most recent contributions\r\nto the question are a pamphlet by Signorelli, _Sull' invenzione della\r\nBussola nautica, ragionamento di Pietro Napoli Signorelli, segretario\r\nperpetuo della Società Pontaniana; letto nella seduta del 30 settembre\r\n1860_; Matteo Camera's _Memorie Storico-diplomatiche dell' antica città e\r\nducato di Amalfi_ (Salerno, 1876); and Admiral Luigi Fincati's work _Il\r\nMagnete, la Calamita, e la Bussola_ (Roma, 1878). An older mention of Gioia\r\nis to be found in Blundevile's _Exercises_ (3rd edition, 1606, pp.\r\n257-258). See also Crescentio _della Nautica Mediterranea_, (Roma, 1607, p.\r\n253), and Azuni, _Dissertazione sull' origine della bussola nautica_\r\n(Venezia, 1797). {9}\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a slip in Gilbert's reference to Andrea Doria, as he\r\nhas confounded the town of Amalfi in Principato Citra with Melfi in\r\nBasilicata.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources relied upon by historians for ascribing this origin of\r\nthe compass is the _Compendia dell' Istoria del Regno di Napoli_, of\r\nCollenuccio (Venet., MDXCI.), p. 5.\r\n\r\n\"Nè in questo tacerò Amalfi, picciola terra, & capo della costa di\r\nPicentia, alia quale tutti quelli, che'l mar caualcano, vfficiosamente\r\neterno gratie debono referire, essendo prima in quella terra trovato l'vso,\r\n& l'artificio della calamita, & del bussolo, col quale i nauiganti, la\r\nstella Tramontana infallibilmente mirando, direzzano il lor corso, si come\r\nè publica fama, & gli Amalfitani si gloriano, nè senza ragione dalli piu si\r\ncrede, essendo cosa certa, che gli antichi tale instromento non hebbero; nè\r\nessendo mai in tutto falso quello, che in molto tempo è da molti si\r\ndiuolga.\"\r\n\r\nAnother account is to be found in the _Historiarum sui temporis_, etc., of\r\nPaulus Jovius (Florent., 1552), tom. ii., cap. 25, p. 42.\r\n\r\n\"Quum essem apud Philippum superuenit Ioachinus Leuantius Ligur a Lotrechio\r\nmissus, qui deposceret captiuos; sed ille negauit se daturum, quando eos ad\r\nipsum Andream Auriam ammirantem deducendos esse iudicaret.

Italia Illustrata_, Basiliæ,\r\n1531, p. 420).\r\n\r\n\"Sed fama est qua Amalphitanos audiuimus gloriari, magnetis usum, cuius\r\nadminiculo nauigantes ad arcton diriguntur, Amalphi suisse inuentum,\r\nquicquid uero habeat in ea re ueritas, certû est id noctu nauigandi\r\nauxilium priscis omnino suisse incognitum.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a further reference to the alleged Amalphian in Caelius\r\nCalcagninus _De re nautica commentatio_. (_See Thesaurus Græcarum\r\nAntiquitatum_, 1697, vol. xi., p. 761.) On the other hand Baptista Porta,\r\nwho wrote in Naples in 1558 (_Magia Naturalis_) distinctly sets aside the\r\nclaim as baseless.\r\n\r\nWilliam Barlowe, in _The Navigators Supply_ (1597, p. A3), says: \"Who was\r\nthe first inuentor of this Instrument miraculous, and endued, as it were,\r\nwith life, can hardly be found. The lame tale of one _Flauius_ at\r\n_Amelphis_, in the kingdome of _Naples_, for to haue deuised it, is of very\r\nslender probabilitie. _Pandulph Collenutius_ writing the Neapolitane\r\nhistorie telleth vs, that they of _Amelphis_ say, it is a common opinion\r\nthere, that it was first found out among them. But _Polidore Virgil_, who\r\nsearched most diligently for the Inuentors of things, could neuer heare of\r\nthis opinion (yet himselfe being an Italian) and as he confesseth in the\r\nlater ende of his third booke _de inventoribus rerum_, could neuer\r\nvnderstand anything concerning the first inuention of this instrument.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Park Benjamin (_Intellectual Rise in Electricity_, p. 146) the\r\nuse of the pivotted compass arose and spread not from Amalfi at the hands\r\nof Italians in the fourteenth century, but from Wisbuy, at the hands of the\r\nFinns, in the middle of the twelfth century. {10}\r\n\r\nHakewill (_An Apologie or Declaration of the Power and Providence of God_,\r\nLondon, 1673, pp. 284-285) says:\r\n\r\n\"But _Blondus_, who is therein followed by _Pancirollus_, both _Italians_,\r\nwill not haue _Italy_ loose the praise thereof, telling vs that about 300\r\nyeares agoe it was found out at Malphis or Melphis, a Citty in the Kingdome\r\nof _Naples_ in the _Province_ of _Campania_, now called _Terra di\r\nLovorador_. But for the Author of it, the one names him not, and the other\r\nassures vs, he is not knowne: yet _Salmuth_ out of _Ciezus & Gomara_\r\nconfidently christens him with the name of _Flavius_, and so doth _Du\r\nBartas_ in those excellent verses of his touching this subject.\r\n\r\n  \"'W' are not to _Ceres_ so much bound for bread,\r\n  Neither to _Bacchus_ for his clusters red,\r\n  As Signior _Flavio_ to thy witty tryall,\r\n  For first inventing of the Sea-mans dyall,\r\n  Th' vse of the needle turning in the same,\r\n  Divine device, O admirable frame!'\r\n\r\n\"It may well be then that _Flavius_ the _Melvitan_ was the first inventor\r\nof guiding the ship by the turning of the needle to the _North_: but some\r\n_German_ afterwards added to the _Compasse_ the 32 points of the winde in\r\nhis owne language, whence other Nations haue since borrowed it.\"\r\n\r\n[15] PAGE 4, LINE 14. Page 4, line 14. _Paulum Venetum_.--The reference is\r\nto Marco Polo. He returned in 1295 from his famous voyage to Cathay. But\r\nthe oft-repeated tale that he first introduced the knowledge of the compass\r\ninto Europe on his return is disposed of by several well-established facts.\r\nKlaproth (_op. citat._, p. 57) adduces a mention of its use in 1240 in the\r\nEastern Mediterranean, recorded in a work written in 1242 by Bailak of\r\nKibdjak.

A clue\r\nto the meaning of _Parvaim_, which should be written in English letters\r\nwith a _v_, not a _u_, will be found in _2 Chronicles_, iii. 6. In the\r\nverse quoted the author speaks of gold as the gold of Parvaim, [Hebrew:\r\nWHAZAHAB ZHAB PARWAYIM], and [Hebrew: PRWYM] Parvaim is taken as a\r\ngold-producing region. It is regarded by some as the same as Ophir. The\r\nword is supposed to be cognate with a Sanskrit word _pûrva_ signifying\r\n\"prior, anterior, oriental.\" There is nothing in the root indicating gold.\r\nA form similar to Parvaim, and also a proper name, is Sepharvaim, found in\r\n_2 Kings_, xix. 13, and in _Isaiah_, xxxvii. 13, and supposed to be the\r\nname of a city in Assyria.\r\n\r\n[18] PAGE 4, LINE 35.

The reference on p. 5\r\nappears to be to the following passage on p. 409 (ed. 1555). \"Demum in\r\nsuppolaribus insulis magnetum montes reperiuntur, quorum fragmentis ligna\r\nfagina certo tempore applicata, in saxeam duritiem, et vim attractivam\r\nconvertuntur,\" or the following on p. 89: \"Magnetes enim in extremo\r\nSeptentrionis veluti montes, unde nautica directio constat, reperiuntur:\r\nquorum etiam magnetum tam vehemens est operatio, ut certis lignis fagineis\r\nconjuncti, ea vertunt in sui duritiem, & naturam attractivam.\" On p. 343 is\r\na woodcut depicting the penalties inflicted by the naval laws upon any one\r\nwho should maliciously tamper with the compass or the loadstone, \"qui\r\nmalitiosè nauticum gnomonem, aut compassum, & præcipuè portionem magnetis,\r\nunde omnium directio dependet, falsaverit.\" He was to be pinned to the mast\r\nby a dagger thrust through his hand. It will be noted that the ships\r\ncarried both a compass, and a piece of loadstone wherewith to stroke the\r\nneedle.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Basel edition of this work, 1567, a note _ad lectorem_, on\r\nthe margin of Carta 16a, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Insula 30 milliarium in longitud. & latitud. Polo arctico subjecta.\r\n\r\n\"Vltra quam directorium nauticum bossolo dic[~u] uires amittit: propterea\r\nquòd ilia insula plena est magnetum.\"\r\n\r\nThis myth of the magnetic mountains, probably originating with Nicander,\r\nappears, possibly from an independent source, in the East, in China, and in\r\nthe tales of the Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nPtolemy gives the following account in his _Geographia_ (lib. vii., cap.\r\n2):\r\n\r\n[Greek: Pherontai de kai allai sunecheis deka nêsoi kaloumenai Maniolai en\r\nais phasi ta sidêrous echonta hêlous ploia katechesthai, mêpote tês\r\nHêrikleias lithou peri autas genomenês, kai dia touto epiourois\r\nnaupêgeisthai.] Some editions omit the name of the Manioles from the\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nNo two authorities agree as to the place of these alleged magnetic\r\nmountains. Some place them in the Red Sea. Fracastorio, _De Sympathia et\r\nAntipathia_, cap. 7 (_Opera omnia_, Giunta edition, 1574, p. 63), gives the\r\nfollowing reason for the variation of the compass:\r\n\r\n\"Nos igitur diligentius rem considerãtes dicimus causam, [~q] perpendiculum\r\nillud ad polum vertatur, esse montes ferri, & magnetis, qui sub polo sunt,\r\nvt negociatores affirmant, quorum species per incredibilem distantiam vsque\r\nad maria nostra propagata ad perpendiculum vsq;, vbi est magnes, consuetam\r\nattractionem facit: propter distantiam autem quum debilis sit, non moueret\r\nquidem magnetem, nisi esset in perpendiculo: quare & si non trahit vsq; ac.\r\nprincipium, vnde effluxit, at mouet tam[~e], & propinquiorem facit, quo\r\npotest. Quod si naues sorte vllæ propinquiores sint illis montibus, ferrum\r\nomne ear[~u] cuellitur, propter quod nauigijs incolæ vtuntur clauis ligneis\r\nastrictis.\"\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of his _De Sympathia_, Fracastorio returns to the\r\nsubject {13} in consequence of some doubts expressed by Giambattista\r\nRhamnusio, seeing that the loadstones in the Island of Elba do not sensibly\r\ndeflect the magnet. Fracastorio replies thus (p. 76, _op. citat._):\r\n\r\n\"Primum igitur vtrum sub Polo sint. Magnetis mõtes, nec ne, sub ambiguo\r\nrelinquamus, scimus enim esse, qui scribãt planas magis esse eas regiones,\r\nde quo Paulus Iouius E[~p]us Nucerinus Lucul[~e]tus historiar[~u] nostri\r\nt[~e]poris scriptor, circa eã Sarmatiæ partem, quæ Moscouia n[~u]c dicitur,\r\ndiligent[~e] inquisitionem ab incolis fecit, qui ne eos etiã inueniri\r\nmontes retulere, qui Rhyphei ab antiquis dicti sunt: meminimus tam[~e] nos\r\nquasdam chartas vidisse earum, quas mundi mappas appellãt, in quibus sub\r\npolo montes notati erant (qui Magnetis montes inscripti fuerant). Siue\r\nigitur sint, siue non sint ij montes, nihil ad nos in præsentiarum attinet,\r\nquando per montes polo subiectos cathenam illam montium intelligimus, qui\r\nad septentrionem spectant tanti, & tam vasti, ac Ferri & Magnetis feraces:\r\nqui, & si magis distant à nostro mari, [~q] Iluæ insulæ montes, potentiores\r\ntamen sunt ad mouendum perpendiculum propter abundantiam & copiã Ferri, &\r\nMagnetis. Fortasse autem, & qui in Ilua est Magnes, non multæ actionis est\r\nin ea minera: multi enim d[~u] in minera sunt, minus valent, [~q] extracti,\r\n[~q] spirituales species sua habeant impedimenta: signum autem parum valere\r\nin sua minera Iluæ insulæ Magnetem, [~q] tam propinquus quum sit nauigijs\r\nillac prætereuntibus, perpendiculum tamen non ad se cõuertit.\"\r\n\r\nAldrovandi in the _Musæum Metallicum_ (Bonon., 1648, p. 554) gives another\r\nversion of the fable:\r\n\r\n\"Nonnulli, animadversa hac Magnetis natura, scripserunt naves, quibus in\r\nCalecutanam regionem navigatur, clavis ferreis non figi, ob magneticorum\r\nfrequentiam scopulorum, quoniam facilè dissolverentur. Sed Garzias in\r\nHistoria Aromatum id fabulosum esse tradidit: quandoquidem plures naues\r\nCalecutanæ regionis, & illius tractus, ferreis clauis iunctas obseruauit:\r\nimmò addidit naues in insulis Maldiuis ligneis quidem clauis copulari, non\r\nquia à Magnete sibi metuant, sed quoniam ferri inopia laborant.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Aldrovandi (p. 563, _op. citat._) the magnetic mountains are\r\nstated by Sir John Mandeville to be in the region of Pontus.\r\n\r\nLipenius in his _Navigatio Salomonis Ophritica illustrata_ (Witteb., 1660),\r\nwhich is a mine of curious learning, in discussing the magnetic mountains\r\nquotes the reply of Socrates to the inquirer who asked him as to what went\r\non in the infernal regions, saying that he had never been there nor had he\r\never met any one who had returned thence.\r\n\r\nThe loadstone rock figures in several early charts. In Nordenskiöld's\r\n_Facsimile Atlas_ (Stockholm, 1889) is given a copy of the Map of Johan\r\nRuysch from an edition of Ptolemy, publisht in Rome in 1508, which shows\r\nfour islands within the ice-bound Arctic regions. South of these islands\r\nand at the east of the coast of Greenland is the inscription: _Hic\r\ncompassus navium non tenet, nec naves quæ ferrum tenent revertere valent._\r\nTo which (on p. 63) Nordenskiöld adds the comment: _Sagan on magnetberg,\r\nsom skulle draga till sig fartyg förande jern, är gamal._ And he recalls\r\nthe reference of Ptolemy to the magnetic rocks in the Manioles. A second\r\ninscription is added to Ruysch's map in the ornamental margin that borders\r\nthe Arctic islands. _Legere est in libro de inventione fortunati sub polo\r\narctico rupem esse excelsam ex lapide magnete 33 miliarium germanorum\r\nambitu._ This refers to a matter recorded in Hakluyt's _Principall\r\nNavigations_ (Lond., 1589, p. 249), namely: \"A Testimonie of the learned\r\nMathematician, maister John Dee, {14} touching the foresaid voyage of\r\nNicholas de Linna. Anno 1360 a frier of Oxford, being a good Astronomer,\r\nwent in companie with others to the most Northren islands of the world, and\r\nthere leaving his company together, he travelled alone, and purposely\r\ndescribed all the Northern islands, with the indrawing seas: and the record\r\nthereof at his return he delivered to the king of England. The name of\r\nwhich booke is _Inventio Fortunata_ (_aliter fortunæ_) _qui liber incipit a\r\ngradu 54 usq. ad polum_.\"\r\n\r\nThe situation of the alleged loadstone rock is thus described by T.\r\nBlundevile in his _Exercises_ in the chapter entitled _A plaine and full\r\ndescription of Peter Plancius his vniuersall Map, seruing both for sea and\r\nland, and by him lately put foorth in the yeare of our Lord, 1592_....\r\nWritten in our mother tongue by M. Blundeuill, Anno Domini 1594. The\r\npassage is quoted from p. 253 of the third edition (1606):\r\n\r\n\"Now betwixt the 72. and 86. degrees of North latitude he setteth downe two\r\nlong Ilands extending from the West towardes the East somewhat beyond the\r\nfirst Meridian, and from the saide Meridian more Eastward he setteth downe\r\nother two long Ilandes ... and hee saith further that right under the North\r\npole there is a certaine blacke and most high rocke which hath in circuite\r\nthirtie and three leagues, which is nintie and nine miles, and that the\r\nlong Iland next to the Pole on the West is the best and most healthfull of\r\nall the North parts. Next to the foresaide Ilandes more Southward hee\r\nsetteth downe the Ilandes of Crocklande and Groynelande, making them to\r\nhaue a farre longer and more slender shape then all other mappes doe....\r\nMoreouer at the East end of the last Ilande somewhat to the Southwarde, he\r\nplaceth the Pole of the Lodestone which is called in Latine Magnes, euen as\r\nMercator doth in his Mappe who supposing the first Meridian to passe\r\nthrough Saint Marie or Saint Michael, which are two of the outermost\r\nIlandes of the Azores Eastwarde, placeth the Pole of the stone in the\r\nseuentie fiue degree of Latitude, but supposing the first Meridian to passe\r\nthrough the Ile Coruo, which is the furthest Ile of the Azores Westwarde,\r\nhe placeth the Pole of the Lodestone in the seuentie seuen degree of\r\nLatitude.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, in the chapter on _The Arte of Nauigation_ in the same work (p.\r\n332, _ed. citat._), Blundevile says:\r\n\r\n\"But whereas Mercator affirmeth that there should bee a mine or great rocke\r\nof Adamant, wherunto all other lesser rockes or Needles touched with the\r\nLodestone doe incline as to their chiefe fountaine, that opinion seemeth to\r\nmee verie straunge, for truely I rather beleeue with Robert Norman that the\r\nproperties of the Stone, as well in drawing steele, as in shewing the North\r\nPole, are secret vertues given of GOD to that stone for mans necessarie vse\r\nand behoofe, of which secrete vertues no man is able to shewe the true\r\ncause.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is one of the inscriptions in the compartments of the great\r\nChart of Mercator entitled _Ad Usum Navigantium_, published in 1569:\r\n\r\n\"Testatur Franciscus Diepanus peritissimus nauarchus volubiles libellas,\r\nmagnetis virtute infectas recta mundi polum respicere in insulis C.\r\nViridis, Solis, Bonauista, et Maio, cui proxime astipulantur qui in\r\nTercera, aut S. Maria (insulæ sunt inter Açores) id fieri dicunt, pauci in\r\nearundem occidentalissima Corvi nomine id contingere opinantur. Quia vero\r\nlocorum longitudinis a communi magnetis et mundi meridiano iustis de causis\r\ninitium sumere oportet, plurium testimonium sequutus primum meridianum per\r\ndictas C. Viridis insulas protraxi, et quum alibi plus minusque a polo\r\ndeuiante {15} magnete polum aliquum peculiarem esse oporteat quo magnetes\r\nex omni mundi parte despiciant, euum hoc quo assignaui loco existere\r\nadhibita declinatione magnetis Ratisbonæ obseruata didici. Supputaui autem\r\neius poli situm etiam respectu insulæ Corui, ut iuxta extremo primi\r\nmeridiani positus extremi etiam termini, intra quos polum hunc inueniri\r\nnecesse est, conspicui fierent, donec certius aliquod nauclerorum\r\nobseruatio attulerit.\"\r\n\r\nNot all the map-makers were as frank as Paulus Merula, the author of a\r\n_Cosmographia Generalis_, printed by Plantin in 1605, at Leyden. For in the\r\ndescription of his _tabula universalis_ (_op. citat._ lib. iii., cap. 9) he\r\nsays that he does not believe in the magnetic islands; but that he has put\r\nthem into his chart lest unskilful folk should think that he had been so\r\ncareless as to leave them out!\r\n\r\nIn the well-known myth of Ogier the Dane, immortalized by William Morris in\r\nthe _Earthly Paradise_ (London, 1869, vol. i., p. 625), the loadstone rock\r\nis an island in the far North. But this story is not one of the\r\nScandinavian sagas, and belongs to the Carlovingian cycle of heroic poems,\r\nof which the chief is the _Chanson de Roland_; and Ogier le Danois is\r\nreally not a Dane but an _Ardennois_.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle-High German epic of Kudrun, the adventures of the fleet of\r\nQueen Hilda when attracted by the loadstone mountain at Givers, in the\r\nNorth Sea, are narrated at some length. (See _Kudrun, herausgegeben und\r\nerklärt von Ernst Martin_. Halle, 1872.) One stanza will serve as a sample:\r\n\r\n  1126. Ze Givers vor dem berge | lac daz Hilden her.\r\n        swie guot ir anker wæren, | an daz vinster mer.\r\n        magnêten die steine | heten si gezogen.\r\n        ir guote segelboume | stuonden alle gebogen.\r\n\r\nwhich may be rendered:\r\n\r\n  1126. At Givers before the mountain | lay Hilda's ships by.\r\n        Though good their anchors were, | upon the murky sea.\r\n        Magnets the stones were | had drawn them thither.\r\n        Their good sailing masts | stood all bent together.\r\n\r\nRecent magnetic research has shown that while there are no magnetic\r\nmountains that would account for the declination of the compass in general,\r\nyet there are minor local variations that can only be accounted for by the\r\npresence of magnetic reefs or rocks. The reader is referred to the account\r\nof the magnetic survey of Great Britain in the _Philosophical Transactions_\r\n(1890) by Professors Rücker and Thorpe. The well-known rocky peak the\r\nRiffelhorn above Zermatt, in Switzerland, produces distinct perturbations\r\nin the direction of the compass within half a mile of its base. Such local\r\nperturbations are regularly used in Sweden for tracing out the position of\r\nunderground lodes of iron ore. See Thalén, _Sur la Recherche des Mines de\r\nFer à l'aide de Mesures magnétiques_ (Soc. Royale des Sciences d'Upsal,\r\n1877); or B. R. Brough, _The Use of the Magnetic Needle in exploring for\r\nIron Ore_ (_Scientific American_, Suppl. No. 608, p. 9708, Aug. 27, 1887).\r\n\r\nQuite recently Dr. Henry Wilde, F.R.S., has endeavoured to elucidate the\r\ndeviations of the compass as the result of the configurations of land and\r\nsea on the globe, by means of a model globe in which the ocean areas are\r\ncovered with thin sheet iron. This apparatus Dr. Wilde calls a\r\n_Magnetarium_. See _Proc. Roy. Soc._, June, 1890, Jan., 1891, and June,\r\n1891. {16} An actual magnetic rock exists in Scandinavia, the following\r\naccount of it being given in the _Electrical Review_ of New York, May 3,\r\n1899:\r\n\r\n\"The island of Bornholm in the Baltic, which consists of a mass of magnetic\r\niron ore, is much feared by mariners. On being sighted they discontinue\r\nsteering by compass, and go instead by lighthouses. Between Bornholm and\r\nthe mainland there is also a dangerous bank of rock under water. It is said\r\nthat the magnetic influence of this ore bank is so powerful that a balanced\r\nmagnetic needle suspended freely in a boat over the bank will take a\r\nvertical position.\"\r\n\r\n[29] PAGE 5, LINE 35. Page 5, line 43. _Josephus Costa._--This is\r\nunquestionably a misprint for _Acosta_ (Joseph de), the Jesuit, whose work\r\n_Historia natural y moral de las Indias_ was publisht at Seville in 1590.\r\nAn Italian edition appeared at Venice in 1596. The English edition,\r\ntranslated by E. Grimestone, _The Naturall and Morall Historie of the East\r\nand West Indies_, was publisht in London in 1604 and 1878. There are in\r\nGilbert's book references to two writers of the name of Costa or Costæus,\r\nJoannes Costa of Lodi, who edited Galen and Avicenna (see pp. 3 and 62),\r\nand Filippo Costa of Mantua, who wrote on antidotes and medicaments (see p.\r\n141). The passage to which Gilbert refers is in Acosta's _Historia_ (ed.\r\n1590, p. 64).\r\n\r\n\"Deziame a mi vn piloto muy diestro Portugues [~q] eran quatro puntos en\r\ntodo el orbe, donde se afixaua el aguja con el Norte, y contaualas por sus\r\nnombres, de que no me acuerdo bien.

In this work\r\nall Liber i. (pages 1-13) deals with observations of the compass,\r\nmentioning Sebastian Cabot, and other navigators.

An English edition, _Natural Magick by John Baptista Porta,\r\na Neapolitaine_, was printed in London, 1658. Book seven of this volume\r\ntreats \"Of the wonders of the Load-stone.\" In the proem to this book Porta\r\nsays: \"I knew at Venice R. M. Paulus, the Venetian, that was busied in the\r\nsame study: he was Provincial of the Order of servants, but now a most\r\nworthy Advocate, from whom I not only confess, that I gained something, but\r\nI glory in it, because of all the men I ever saw, I never saw any man more\r\nlearned, or more ingenious, having obtained the whole body of learning; and\r\nis not only the Splendor and Ornament of Venice or Italy, but of the whole\r\nworld.\" The reference is to Fra Paolo Sarpi, better known as the historian\r\nof the Council of Trent. Sarpi was himself known to Gilbert. {17}\r\n\r\nHis relations with Gilbert are set forth in the memoir prefixt to the\r\nedition of his works, _Opere di Fra Paolo Sarpi, Servita_ ... in Helmstat,\r\nMDCCLXI, p. 83. \"Fino a questi giorni continuava il Sarpi a raccorre\r\nosservazioni sulla declinazione dell' Ago Calamitato; e poi ch' egli,\r\natteso il variare di tal declinazione, assurdità alcuna non trovava\r\nriguardo al pensamento dell' Inglese Guglielmo Gilberto, cioè, che\r\nl'interno del nostro Globo fosse gran Calamita....\" Here follows a\r\nquotation from a letter of Sarpi to Lescasserio:\r\n\r\n\"... Unde cuspidem trahi a tanta mole terrena, quæ supereminet non absurde\r\nputavit Gullielmus Gilbertus, et in eo meridiano respicere recta polum,\r\ncave putes observatorem errasse.

He\r\nalso wrote on magnetism and other topics _in materia di Fisica_, but these\r\nwritings have perisht. He appears to have been the first to recognize that\r\nfire destroyed the magnetic properties. (See _Fra Paolo Sarpi, the greatest\r\nof the Venetians_ by the Rev. Alexander Robertson, London, 1894; see also\r\nthe notice of Sarpi in Park Benjamin's _Intellectual Rise in Electricity_.)\r\n\r\n[33] PAGE 6, LINE 7. Page 6, line 11.: _R. M. Paulus Venetus_.

But on p. 530 of the same work he ridicules Plutarch for\r\nrecording this very matter.\r\n\r\n[42] PAGE 7, LINE 20. Page 7, line 27. _Marbodæus Gallus_.--This rare\r\nlittle book is entitled _Marbodei Galli Poetæ vetustissimi de lapidibus\r\npretiosis Enchiridion_. It was printed at Paris in 1531. The Freiburg\r\nedition, also of 1531, has the commentaries of Pictorius. The poem is in\r\nLatin hexameters. After a preface of twenty-one lines the virtues of stones\r\nare dealt with, the paragraph beginning with a statement that Evax, king of\r\nthe Arabs, is said to have written to Nero an account of the species, names\r\nand colours of stones, their place of origin and their potencies; and that\r\nthis work formed the basis of the poem. The alleged magical powers of the\r\nmagnet are recited in Caput I., _Adamas_. Caput XLIII., _Magnes_, gives\r\nfurther myths. {19} The commentary of Pictorius gives references to earlier\r\nwriters, Pliny, Dioscorides, Bartholomæus Anglicus, Solinus, Serapio, and\r\nto the book _de lapidibus_ erroneously ascribed to Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the poem of Marbodeus:\r\n\r\n  _Magnetes lapis est inuentus apud Trogloditas,_\r\n  _Qu[=e] lapid[=a] genetrix nihilominus India mittit._\r\n  _Hic ferruginei cognoscitur esse coloris,_\r\n  _Et ui naturæ uicinum tollere ferrum._\r\n  _Ededon magus hoc primum ferè dic[=i]tur usus,_\r\n  _Conscius in magica nihil esse potentius arte._\r\n  _Post illum fertur famosa uenefica Circe_\r\n  _Hoc in præstigijs magicis specialiter usa._\r\n\r\nThis poem was reprinted (1854) in Migne's _Patrologia_. In 1799 Johann\r\nBeckmann issued an annotated variorum edition of Marbodeus (_Marbodi Liber\r\nLapidvm sev de Gemmis_..., Göttingæ, 1799), in which there is a\r\nbibliography of the poem, the first edition of which appears to have been\r\npublisht in 1511, at Vienna, thirteen other editions being described.\r\nBeckmann adds many illustrative notes, and a notice of the Arabian Evax,\r\nwho is supposed to have written the treatise _de lapidibus_. Not the least\r\ncurious part is a French translation alleged to have been written in 1096,\r\nof which Chap. XIX. on the Magnet begins thus:\r\n\r\n  Magnete trovent Trogodite,\r\n  En Inde e precieus est ditte.\r\n  Fer resemble e si le trait,\r\n  Altresi cum laimant fait.\r\n  Dendor lama mult durement.\r\n  Qi lusoit a enchantement.\r\n  Circe lus a dot mult chere,\r\n  Cele merveillose forciere, &c.\r\n\r\n[43] PAGE 7, LINE 21.

Page 9, line 30. _Differentiæ priscis ex\r\ncolore_.--Pliny's account of the loadstones of different colours which came\r\nfrom different regions is mainly taken from Sotacus. The white magnet,\r\nwhich was friable, like pumice, and which did not draw iron, was probably\r\nsimply magnesia. The blue loadstones were the best. See p. 587 of Holland's\r\ntranslation of Pliny, London, 1601. St. Isidore (_Originum seu\r\nEtymologiarum_, lib. xvi., cap. 4) says: \"Omnis autem magnes tanta melior\r\nest, quanto [magis] cæruleus est.\"\r\n\r\n[50] PAGE 10, LINE 29.

He gives little\r\nmore than is to be found in Pliny. For more complete discussions the reader\r\nis referred to Buttmann, _Bemerkungen über die Benennungen einiger\r\nMineralien bei den Alten, vorzüglich des Magnetes und des Basaltes_ (Musæum\r\nder Alterthumswissenschaft, Bd. II., pp. 5-52, and 102-104, 1808); G.\r\nFournier, _Hydrographie_ (livre xi., chap. I, 1643); Ulisse Aldrovandi,\r\n_Musæum Metallicum_ (Bononiæ, 1648, lib. iv., cap. 2, p. 554); Klaproth,\r\n_Lettre à M. le Baron A. de Humboldt, sur l'invention de la Boussole_,\r\nParis, 1834; T. S. Davies, _The History of Magnetical Discovery_ (Thomson's\r\n_British Annual_, 1837, pp. 250-257); Th. Henri Martin, _De l'Aimant, de\r\nses noms divers et de ses variétés suivant les Anciens_ (Mémoires présentés\r\npar divers savants a l'Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres, I^{re}\r\nsérie, t. vi., I^{re} partie, 1861); G. A. Palm, _Der Magnet in Alterthum_\r\n(Programm des k. württembergischen Seminars Maulbronn, Stuttgart, {21}\r\n1867). Of these works, those of Klaproth and of Martin are by far the most\r\nimportant. Klaproth states that in modern Greek, in addition to the name\r\n[Greek: magnêtis], the magnet also has the names [Greek: adamas] and\r\n[Greek: kalamita]. The former of these, in various forms, _adamas_,\r\n_adamant_, _aimant_, _yman_, and _piedramon_, has gone into many languages.\r\nOriginally the word [Greek: adamas] (the unconquered) was applied by the\r\nGreeks to the hardest of the metals with which they were acquainted, that\r\nis to say, to hard-tempered iron or steel, and it was subsequently because\r\nof its root-signification also given by them to the diamond for the same\r\nreason; it was even given to the henbane because of the deadly properties\r\nof that plant. In the writings of the middle ages, in St. Augustine, St.\r\nIsidore, Marbodeus, and even in Pliny, we find some confusion between the\r\ntwo uses of _adamas_ to denote the loadstone as well as the diamond.\r\nCertainly the word _adamas_, without ceasing to be applied to the diamond,\r\nalso designated the loadstone. At the same time (says Martin) the word\r\n_magnes_ was preserved, as Pliny records, to designate a loadstone of\r\nlesser strength than the _adamas_. On the other hand, the word _diamas_, or\r\n_deamans_, had already in the thirteenth century been introduced into Latin\r\nto signify the diamond as distinguisht from the magnet. _Adamas_ was\r\nrendered _aymant_ in the romance version of the poem of Marbodeus on stones\r\n(see Beckmann's variorum edition of 1799, p. 102), and in this form it was\r\nfor a time used to denote both the magnet and the diamond. Then it\r\ngradually became restricted in use to the stone that attracts iron.\r\n\r\nSome confusion has also arisen with respect to the Hebrew name of the\r\nmagnet. Sir W. Snow Harris makes the following statement (_Magnetism_, p.\r\n5): \"In the Talmud it [the loadstone] is termed _achzhàb'th_, the stone\r\nwhich attracts; and in their ancient prayers it has the European name\r\n_magn[=e]s_.\" On this point Dr. A. Löwy has furnisht the following notes.\r\nThe loadstone is termed in one of the Talmudical sections and in the\r\nMidrash, _Eben Shoebeth_ (lapis attrahens). This would of course be written\r\n[Hebrew: 'BN SHW'BT]. Omitting the [Hebrew: W] which marks the participial\r\nconstruction, the words would stand thus: [Hebrew: 'BN SH'BT] A person\r\nreferring to Buxtorf's _Lexicon_ Talmudicum would in the index look out for\r\n\"Lapis magnesius,\" or for \"magnes.\" He would then, in the first instance,\r\nbe referred to the two words already quoted. Not knowing the value of the\r\nletters of the Hebrew alphabet, he reads [Hebrew: 'BN SH'BT] thus: [Hebrew:\r\n'KZSH'BT] achzhab'th. It is true that Buxtorf has inserted in his _Lexicon_\r\nthe vocable [Hebrew: MAGNIYSEIS], \"corruptum ex gr. [Greek: magnês,\r\nmagnêtês, magnêtis], named after the Asiatic city Magnesia.\" He goes on to\r\nsay, \"Inde Achilles Statius istum lapidem vocavit [Greek: magnêsian\r\nlithon]. Hinc [Hebrew: 'BN HMGNJSS CHMSHWK HBRZL]. Lapis Magnesius trahit\r\nferrum.\" Here he quotes from (Sepher) Ikkarem IV., cap. 35.\r\n\r\nKircher, in his _Magnes, sive de Arte magnetica_ (Coloniæ, 1643), gives\r\nseveral other references to Hebrew literature. Others have supposed that\r\nthe word [Hebrew: CHLMYSH] _khallamish_, which signifies pebble, rock, or\r\nhard rock, to be used for the magnet.\r\n\r\nAs to the other Greek name, [Greek: sidêritis], or [Greek: lithos\r\nsidêritis] this was given not only to the loadstone but also to\r\nnon-magnetic iron. In the _Etymologicum magnum_ (under the word [Greek:\r\nmagnêtis]), and in Photius (_Quæst. amphiloch._, q. 131), it is stated that\r\nthe name _sideritis_ was given to the loadstone either because of its\r\naction on iron, or of its resemblance in aspect to iron, _or rather_, they\r\nsay, _because the loadstone was originally found in the mines of this\r\nmetal_. Alexander of Aphrodisias expressly says (_Quætiones Physicæ_, II.\r\n23) that {22} the loadstone appears to be nothing else than [Greek: gê\r\nsidêritis], the earth which yields iron, or the earth of iron.\r\n\r\n[53] PAGE 11, LINE 19. Page 11, line 29. _ab Orpheo_.--The reference is to\r\nv. 301-328 of the [Greek: Lithika]. The passage, as given in Abel's edition\r\n(Berol., 1881), begins:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Tolma d' athanatous kai henêei meilissethai]\r\n  [Greek: magnêssêi, tên d' exoch' ephilato thousios Arês,]\r\n  [Greek: houneken, hoppote ken pelasêi polioio sidêrou,]\r\n  [Greek: êute parthenikê terenochroa chersin helousa]\r\n  [Greek: êitheon sternôi prosptussetai himeroenti,]\r\n  [Greek: hôs hêg' harpazousa poti spheteron demas haiei]\r\n  [Greek: aps palin ouk ethelei methemen polemista sidêron.]\r\n\r\n[54] PAGE 11, LINE 20. Page 11, line 31. _Gallis aimant_.--The French word\r\n_aimant_, or _aymant_, is generally supposed to be derived from _adamas_.\r\nNevertheless Klaproth (_op. citat._, p. 19) suggests that the word _aimant_\r\nis a mere literal translation into French of the Chinese word _thsu chy_,\r\nwhich is the common name of the magnet, and which means _loving stone_, or\r\n_stone that loves_. All through the east the names of the magnet have\r\nmostly the same signification, for example, in Sanskrit it is _thoumbaka_\r\n(the kisser), in Hindustani _tchambak_.\r\n\r\n[55] PAGE 11, LINE 20. Page 11, line 32. _Italis calamita_.--The name\r\n_calamita_, universal in Italian for the magnet, is also used in Roumanian,\r\nCroatian, Bosnian, and Wendish. Its supposed derivation from the Hebrew\r\n_khallamîsh_ is repudiated by Klaproth, who also points out that the use of\r\n[Greek: kalamita] in Greek is quite modern. He adds that the only\r\nreasonable explanation of the word _calamita_ is that given by Father\r\nFournier (_op. citat._), who says:\r\n\r\n\"Ils (les marins français) la nomment aussi _calamite_, qui proprement en\r\nfrançais signifie une _grenouille verte_, parce qu'avant qu'on ait trouvé\r\nl'invention de suspendre et de balancer sur un pivot l'aiguille aimantée,\r\nnos ancêtres l'enfermaient dans une fiole de verre demi-remplie d'eau, et\r\nla faisaient flotter, par le moyen de deux petits fétus, sur l'eau comme\r\nune grenouille.\" Klaproth adds that he entirely agrees with the learned\r\nJesuit, but maintains that the word _calamite_, to designate the little\r\ngreen frog, called to-day _le graisset_, _la raine_, or _la rainette_, is\r\nessentially Greek. For we read in Pliny (_Hist. Nat._ lib. xxxii., ch. x.):\r\n\"Ea rana quam Græci _calamiten_ vocant, quoniam inter arundines,\r\nfruticesque vivat, minima omnium est et viridissima.\"\r\n\r\n[56] PAGE 11, LINE 20. Page 11, line 32. _Anglis_ loadstone & adamant\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThe English term _loadstone_ is clearly connected with the Anglo-Saxon verb\r\n_loedan_, to lead, and with the Icelandic _leider-stein_. There is no doubt\r\nthat the spelling _lodestone_ would be etymologically more correct, since\r\nit means _stone that leads_ not _stone that carries a load_. The correct\r\nform is preserved in the word _lode-star_.\r\n\r\nThe word _adamant_, from _adamas_, the mediæval word for both loadstone and\r\ndiamond, also occurs in English for the loadstone, as witness Shakespeare:\r\n\r\n  \"You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant\r\n  But yet you draw not iron; for my heart\r\n  Is true as steel.\"\r\n          _Midsummer Night's Dream_, Act II, Scene 1.\r\n\r\n[57] PAGE 11, LINE 21.

In this line the Greek sentence\r\nis, in every known copy of the folio of 1600, corrected in ink upon the\r\ntext, [Greek: thalês] being thus altered into [Greek: Thalês], and [Greek:\r\napomnemonuousi] into [Greek: apomnemoneuousi]. Four lines lower, brackets\r\nhave been inserted around the words (lapidum specularium modo). These ink\r\ncorrections must have been made at the printers', possibly by Gilbert's own\r\nhand. They have been carried out as errata in the editions of 1628 and\r\n1633. The \"facsimile\" Berlin reprint of 1892 has deleted them, however.\r\nOther ink corrections on pp. 14, 22, 38, 39, 47, 130, and 200 of the folio\r\nedition of 1600 are noted in due course.\r\n\r\n[59] PAGE 11, LINE 29.

[Greek: mikrogê] _seu Terrella_.\r\nAlthough rounded loadstones had been used before Gilbert's time (see\r\nPeregrinus, p. 3 of Augsburg edition of 1558, or Baptista Porta, p. 194, of\r\nEnglish edition of 1658), Gilbert's use of the spherical loadstone as a\r\nmodel of the globe of the earth is distinctive. The name _Terrella_\r\nremained in the language. In _Pepys's Diary_ we read how on October 2,\r\n1663, he \"received a letter from Mr. Barlow with a terella.\" John Evelyn,\r\nin his _Diary_, July, 1655, mentions a \"pretty terella with the circles and\r\nshowing the magnetic deviations.\"\r\n\r\nA Terrella, 4½ inches in diameter, was presented in 1662 by King Charles I.\r\nto the Royal Society, and is still in its possession. It was examined in\r\n1687 (see _Phil. Transactions_ for that year) by the Society to see whether\r\nthe positions of its poles had changed.\r\n\r\nIn Grew's _Catalogue and Description of the Rarities belonging to the Royal\r\nSociety and preserved at Gresham College_ (London, 1681, p. 364) is\r\nmentioned a Terrella contrived by Sir Christopher Wren, with one half\r\nimmersed in the centre of a plane horizontal table, so as to be like a\r\nGlobe with the poles in the horizon, having thirty-two magnet needles\r\nmounted in the margin of the table to show \"the different respect of the\r\n_Needle_ to the several _Points_ of the _Loadstone_.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sir John Pettus's _Fleta Minor_, London, 1683, in the _Dictionary of\r\nMetallick Words_ at the end, under the word _Loadstone_ occurs the\r\nfollowing passage:\r\n\r\n\"Another piece of Curiosity I saw in the Hands of Sir _William Persal_\r\n(since Deceased also) _viz._, a _Terrella_ or _Load-stone_, of little more\r\nthan _6 Inches Diameter_, turned into a _Globular Form_, and all the\r\n_Imaginery Lines_ of our _Terrestrial Globe_, exactly drawn upon it: _viz._\r\nthe _Artick _ and _Antartick Circles_, the _two Tropicks_, the _two\r\nColures_, the _Zodiack_ and _Meridian_; and these _Lines_, and the several\r\n_Countryes_, artificially _Painted_ on it, and all of them with their true\r\n_Distances_, from the two _Polar Points_, and to find the truth of those\r\n_Points_, he took two _little pieces_ of a _Needle_, each of about _half_\r\n{24} _an Inch in length_, and those he laid on the _Meridian line_, and\r\nthen with _Brass Compasses_, moved one of them towards the _Artick_, which\r\nas it was moved, still raised it self at one end higher and higher, keeping\r\nthe other end fixt to the _Terrella_; and when it had compleated it Journy\r\nto the very _Artick Points_, it stood upright upon that _Point_; then he\r\nmoved the other piece of _Needle_ to the _Antartick Point_, which had its\r\n_Elevations_ like the other, and when it came to the _Point_, it fixt it\r\nself upon that _Point_, and stood _upright_, and then taking the _Terrella_\r\nin my Hand, I could perfectly see that the two _pieces_ of _Needles_ stood\r\nso exactly one against the other, as if it had been one intire _long\r\nNeedle_ put through the _Terrella_, which made me give credit to those who\r\nheld, That there is an _Astral Influence_ that _darts_ it self through the\r\n_Globe_ of _Earth_ from _North_ to _South_ (and is as the _Axel-Tree_ to\r\nthe _Wheel_, and so called the _Axis_ of the _World_) about which the\r\n_Globe_ of the _Earth_ is turned, by an _Astral Power_, so as what I\r\nthought _imaginary_, by this _Demonstration_, I found _real_.\"\r\n\r\n[63] PAGE 13, LINE 20. Page 13, line 22. The editions of 1628 and 1633 give\r\na different woodcut from this: they show the terrella lined with meridians,\r\nequator, and parallels of latitude: and they give the compass needle, at\r\nthe top, _pointing in the wrong direction_.\r\n\r\n[64] PAGE 14, LINE 3.

On\r\np. 20 he had denied their proposition that the differences between silver,\r\ngold, and copper could arise from proportions of their constituent\r\nmaterials; and he likewise denounced unsparingly the supposed relation\r\nbetween the seven metals and the seven planets. He now denounces the vain\r\ndreams of turning all metals into gold, and all stones into diamonds. Later\r\nhe rejects as absurd the magnetic curing of wounds. His detachment from the\r\npseudo-science of his age was unique if not complete.\r\n\r\n[77] PAGE 25, LINE 15.

Maskelyne denominates as _siderites_\r\nthose meteorites which consist chiefly of iron. They usually contain from\r\n80 to 95 per cent. of iron, often alloyed with nickel. This meteoric iron\r\nis sometimes so pure that it can at once be forged by the smith. An\r\nadmirable summary of the whole subject is to be found in L.

Page 27, line 2. _aut stannum, aut plumbum album._\r\nAlthough most authorities agree in translating _plumbum album_ or _plumbum\r\ncandidum_ as \"tin\" (which is unquestionably the meaning in such examples as\r\nPliny's _Nat. Hist._, xxxiv. 347, and iv. 16; or Strabo, iii. 147),\r\nnevertheless it is certain that here _plumbum album_ is not given as a\r\nsynonym of _stannum_ and therefore is not _tin_. That Gilbert meant either\r\nspelter or pewter is pretty certain. He based his metallic terms mainly\r\nupon Encelius (Christoph Entzelt) whose _De Re Metallica_ was published at\r\nFrankfurt in 1551. From this work are taken the following passages: {27}\r\n\r\np. 61. _De Plumbo candido._ Cap. XXXI.\r\n\r\n\"Veluti plumbum nigr[~u] uocatur à Germanis blei simpliciter, od'\r\nschwartzblei: ita plumb[~u] candid[~u] ab his uocatur weissblei, od' ziñ.\r\nImpropriè autem plumbum hoc nostrum candidum ziñ, stannum dicitur.

On p. 140 of Joseph Glanvill's _Vanity of\r\nDogmatizing_ (Lond., 1661) we read: \"We believe the _verticity_ of the\r\n_Needle_, without a Certificate from the _dayes_ of _old_.\"\r\n\r\n[85] PAGE 29, LINE 15. Page 29, line 16. _Nos verò diligentiùs omnia\r\nexperientes._--The method of carefully trying everything, instead of\r\naccepting statements on authority, is characteristic of Gilbert's work. The\r\nlarge asterisks affixed to Chapters IX. X. XI. XII. and XIII. of Book I.\r\nindicate that Gilbert considered them to announce important original\r\nmagnetical discoveries. The electrical discoveries of Book II., Chapter\r\nII., are similarly distinguished. A rich crop of new magnetical\r\nexperiments, marked with marginal asterisks, large and small, is to be\r\nfound in Book II., from Chapter XV. to Chapter XXXIV.; while a third series\r\nof experimental magnetical discoveries extends throughout Book III.\r\n\r\n[86] PAGE 31, LINE 30.

Venezia MDCXVI., p. 208.\r\n\r\n\"Nè meno è questa pietra velenosa, si come molti hanno tenuto; imperoche le\r\ngenti di queste bande dicono che la Calamita presa per bocca, però in poca\r\n{28} quantità, conserva la gioventù.

Ptolemæus._--The\r\ngarlick myth has already been referred to in the note to p. 1. The\r\noriginals are Plutarch, _Quæstiones Platonicæ_, lib. vii., cap. 7, § 1; C.\r\nPtolemæus, _Opus Quadripartitum,_ bk. i., cap. 3. The English translation\r\nof the latter, by Whalley (London, 1701), p. 10, runs: \"For if the\r\n_Loadstone_ be _Rubbed_ with _Garlick_, the _Iron will not be drawn by\r\nit_.\"\r\n\r\n[89] PAGE 32, LINE 32. Page 32, line 33. _Medici nonnulli._--This is\r\napparently a reference to the followers of Rhazes and Paracelsus. The\r\nargument of Gilbert as to the inefficacy of powdered loadstones is\r\nreproduced more fully by William Barlowe in his _Magneticall\r\nAduertisements_ (1616, p. 7), as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is the goodnesse of the _Loadstone_ ioyned with a fit forme that will\r\nshew great force. For as a very good forme with base substance can doe but\r\nvery litle, so the substance of the _Loadstone_ bee it neuer so excellent,\r\nexcept it haue some conuenient forme, is not auaileable. For example, an\r\nexcellent _loadstone_ of a pound waight and of a good fashion, being vsed\r\nartificially, may take vp foure pounds of Iron; beate it into small pouder,\r\nand it shall bee of no force to take vp one ounce of Iron; yea I am very\r\nwell assured that halfe an ounce of a Loadstone of good fashion, and of\r\nlike vertue will take vp more then that pound will doe being beaten into\r\npowder. Whence (to adde this by the way) it appeareth manifestly, that it\r\nis a great error of those Physitions and Surgeons, which to remedy\r\nruptures, doe prescribe vnto their Patients to take the pouder of a\r\n_Loadstone_ inwardly, and the small filing of iron mingled in some plaister\r\noutwardly: supposing that herein the _magneticall_ drawing should doe great\r\nwonders.\"\r\n\r\n[90] PAGE 33, LINE 11. Page 33, line 8. _Nicolaus in emplastrum\r\ndivinum._...--Nicolaus Myrepsus is also known as Præpositas. In his _Liber\r\nde compositione medicamentorum_ (Ingoldstat, 1541, 4to) are numerous\r\nrecipes containing loadstone: for example, Recipe No. 246, called \"esdra\r\nmagna,\" is a medicine given for inflammation of the stomach and for\r\nstrangury, compounded of some forty materials including \"litho demonis\" and\r\n\"lapis magnetis.\" The _emplastrum divinum_ does not, however, appear to\r\ncontain loadstone. In the English tractate, _Præpositas his Practise, a\r\nworke ... for the better preservation of the Health of Man. Wherein are ...\r\napproved Medicines, Receiptes and Ointmentes. Translated out of Latin in to\r\nEnglish by_ L. M. (London, 1588, 4to), we read on p. 35, \"An Emplaister of\r\nD. N. [Doctor Nicolaus] which the Pothecaries call Divinum.\" This contains\r\nlitharge, bdellium, and \"green brasse,\" but no loadstone.\r\n\r\nLuis de Oviedo in his treatise _Methodo de la Coleccion y reposicion de las\r\nMedicinas simples_, edited by Gregorio Gonçalez, Boticario (Madrid, 1622),\r\ngives (p. 502) the following: \"Emplasto de la madre. _Recibe_: Nuezes\r\nmoscadas, clauos, cinamono, artemisia, piedraimon. De cada uno dos\r\nonças.... Entre otras differencias que ay de piedraiman se hallan dos. Vna\r\nque por la parte que mira al Septentrion, atrae el hierro, por lo quel se\r\nllama magnes ferrugineus. Y otra que atrae la carne, a la qual llaman\r\nmagnes creaginus.\"\r\n\r\nAn \"Emplastrum sticticum\" containing amber, mummy, loadstone, {29}\r\nhæmatite, and twenty other ingredients, and declared to be \"vulnerum\r\nulcerumque telo inflictorum sticticum emplastrum præstantissimum,\" is\r\ndescribed on p. 267 of the _Basilica chimica_ of Oswaldus Crollius\r\n(Frankfurt, 1612).\r\n\r\n[91] PAGE 33, LINE 12. Page 33, line 9. _Augustani ... in emplastrum\r\nnigrum_....--Amongst the physicians of the Augsburg school the most\r\ncelebrated were Adolphus Occo, Ambrosio Jung, and Gereone Seyler. This\r\nparticular reference is to the _Pharmacopoeia Augustana_ ... _a Collegio\r\nMedico recognita_, published at Augsburg, and which ran through many\r\neditions. The recipe for the \"_emplastrum nigrum vulgo Stichpflaster_\" will\r\nbe found on p. 182 of the seventh edition (1621-2). The recipe begins with\r\noil of roses, colophony, wax, and includes some twenty-two ingredients,\r\namongst them mummy, dried earthworms, and two ounces _lapidis magnetis\r\npræparati_. The recipe concludes: \"Fiat Emplastrum secundùm artem. Perquàm\r\nefficax ad recentia vulnera et puncturas, vndè denominationem habet.\" The\r\nvolume is a handsome folio not unlike Gilbert's own book, and bears at the\r\nend of the prefatory address _ad Lectorem_ identically the same _cul de\r\nlampe_ as is found on p. 44 of _De Magnete_.\r\n\r\nThe contradictions as to the alleged medicinal virtues of loadstone are\r\nwell illustrated by Galen, who in his _De facultatibus_ says that loadstone\r\nis like hæmatite, which is astringent, while in his _De simplici medicina_\r\nhe says it is purgative.\r\n\r\n[92] PAGE 33, LINE 14. Page 33, line 12. _Paracelsus in fodicationum\r\nemplastrum_.--Paracelsus's recipe for a plaster against stab-wounds is to\r\nbe found in _Wundt vund Leibartznei_ ... D. Theoph. Paracelsus (Frankf.,\r\n1555, pp. 63-67).\r\n\r\n[93] PAGE 33, LINE 17. Page 33, line 15. _Ferri vis medicinalis_.--This\r\nchapter on the medicinal virtues of iron is a summary of the views held\r\ndown to that time. Those curious to pursue the subject should consult\r\nWaring's _Bibliotheca Therapeutica_ (London, 1878). Nor should they miss\r\nthe rare black-letter quarto by Dr. Nicholas Monardus, of Seville, _Joyfull\r\nNewes out of the New-found Worlde_, translated by John Frampton (London,\r\n1596), in which are recited the opinions of Galen, Rhazes, Avicenna, and\r\nothers, on the medicinal properties of iron. In addition to the views of\r\nthe Arabic authors, against whom his arguments are directed, Gilbert\r\ndiscusses those of Joannes Manardus, Curtius, and Fallopius. The treatise\r\nof Manardus, _Epistolarum medicinalium libri viginti_ (Basil., 1549), is a\r\n_résumé_ of the works of Galen and the Arabic physicians, but gives little\r\nrespecting iron. Curtius (Nicolaus) was the author of a book, _Libellus de\r\nmedicamentis præparatibus et purgantibus_ (Giessæ Cattorum, 1614). The\r\nworks of Fallopius are _De Simplicibus Medicamentis purgentibus tractatus_\r\n(Venet., 1566, 4to), and _Tractatus de Compositione Medicamentorum_\r\n(Venet., 1570, 4to).\r\n\r\n[94] PAGE 34, LINE 7.

In the splendid\r\nfolio work of Rhazes publisht at Venice in 1542, with the title _Habes\r\ncandide lector Contin[~e]tem Rasis_, Libri ultimi, cap. 295, under the\r\nheading _De Ferro,_ are set forth the virtues of iron slag: \"Virtus scorie\r\nest sicut virtus scorie [a]eris sed debilior in purgãdo: et erugo ferri\r\nest stiptica: et c[~u] superpositur retinet fluxus menstruor[~u]....

Est lapis qui attrahit\r\nferrum, quum ergo aduritur, fit hæmatites, & virtus ejus est sicut virtus\r\nillius.... Datur in potu [ad bibitionem limaturæ ferri, quum retinetur in\r\nventre scoria ferri. Ipse enim extrahit] ipsam, & associatur ei apud\r\nexitum. Et dicitur, quando in potu sumuntur ex eo tres anulusat cum\r\nmellicrato, educit solutione humorem grossum malum.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage is identical with that in the Venetian edition of 1486, in both\r\nof which the liquid prescribed is mellicratus--mead. Gilbert says that the\r\niron is to be given in juice of _mercurialis_. Here he only follows\r\nMatthiolus, who, in his _Commentaries on Dioscorides_, says (p. 998 of the\r\nBasil. edition of 1598): \"Sed (vt idem Auicenna scribit) proprium hujusce\r\nferrei pharmaci antidotum, est lapis magnes drachmæ pondere potus, ex\r\nmercurialis, vel betæ succo.\"\r\n\r\nSerapio, in his _De Simplicibus Medicinis_ (Brunfels' edition, Argentorati,\r\n1531), p. 264, refers to Galen's prescription of iron scoriæ, and under the\r\narticle _de lapide magnetis_, p. 260, quotes Dioscorides as follows: \"Et\r\nuirtus huius lapidis est, ut quãdo dantur in potu duo onolosat ex eo c[~u]\r\nmelicrato, laxat humores grossos.\"\r\n\r\nThe original passage in Dioscorides, _De Materia Medica,_ ch. 147\r\n(Spengel's edition of 1829) runs: \"[Greek: Tou de magnêtou lithou aristos\r\nestin ho ton sidêron eucherôs helkôn, kai tên chroan kuanizôn, puknos te\r\nkai ouk agan barus. Dunamin de echei pachous agôgon didomenos meta\r\nmelikratou triôbolou baros; enioi de touton kaiontes anti haimatitou\r\npipraskousin.].\"\r\n\r\nIn the Frankfurt edition of Dioscorides, translated by Ruellius (1543), the\r\npassage is:\r\n\r\n\"Magnes lapis optimus est, qui ferrum facile trahit, colore ad coeruleum\r\nuergente, densus, nec admodum gravis. Datur cum aqua mulsa, trium obolorum\r\npondere, ut crassos humores eliciat.

Page 47, line 18. _Græci vocant_ [Greek: êlektron],\r\n_quia ad se paleas trahit._ In this discussion of the names given to amber,\r\nGilbert apparently conceives [Greek: êlektron] to be derived from the verb\r\n[Greek: helkein]; which is manifestly a doubtful etymology. There has been\r\nmuch discussion amongst philologists as to the derivation of [Greek:\r\nêlektron] or [Greek: êlektron], and its possible connection with the word\r\n[Greek: êlektôr]. This discussion has been somewhat obscured by the\r\ncircumstance that the Greek authors unquestionably used [Greek: êlektron]\r\n(and the Latins their word _electrum_) in two different significations,\r\nsome of them using these words to mean amber, others to mean a shining {32}\r\nmetal, apparently of having qualities between those of gold and silver, and\r\nprobably some sort of alloy. Schweigger, _Ueber das Elektron der Alten_\r\n(Greifswald, 1848), has argued that this metal was indeed no other than\r\nplatinum: but his argument partakes too much of special pleading. Those who\r\ndesire to follow the question of the derivation of [Greek: êlektron] may\r\nconsult the following authorities: J. M. Gessner, _De Electro Veterum_\r\n(Commentt. Soc. Reg. Scientt. Goetting., vol. iii., p. 67, 1753); Delaunay,\r\n_Mineralogie der Alten_, Part II., p. 125; Buttmann, _Mythologus_ (Appendix\r\nI., _Ueber das Elektron_), Vol. II., p. 355, in which he adopts Gilbert's\r\nderivation from [Greek: helkein]; Beckmann, _Ursprung und Bedeutung des\r\nBernsteinnamens Elektron_ (Braunsberg, 1859); Th. Henri Martin, _Du Succin,\r\nde ses noms divers et de ses variétés suivant les anciens_ (Mémoires de\r\nl'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-lettres, Tome VI., 1^{re} série,\r\n1^{re} partie, 1860); Martinus Scheins, _De Electro Veterum Metallico_\r\n(Inaugural dissertation, Berlin, 1871); F. A. Paley, _Gold Worship in\r\nrelation to Sun Worship_ (Contemporary Review, August, 1884). See also\r\nCurtius, _Grundzüge der griechischen Etymologie_, pp. 656-659. The net\r\nresult of the disputations of scholars appears to be that [Greek: êlektôr]\r\n(he who shines) is a masculine form to which there corresponds the neuter\r\nform [Greek: êlektron] (that which shines). Stephanus admits the\r\naccentuation used by Gilbert, [Greek: êlektron], to be justified from the\r\n_Timæus_ of Plato; see Note to p. 61.\r\n\r\n[109] PAGE 47, LINE 16. Page 47, line 19. [Greek: harpax] dicitur, &\r\n[Greek: chrusophoron].--With respect to the other names given to amber, M.\r\nTh. Henri Martin has written (see previous note) so admirable an account of\r\nthem that it is impossible to better it. It is therefore given here entire,\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Le succin a reçu chez les anciens des noms très-divers. Sans parler du\r\n    nom de [Greek: lunkourion], lyncurium, qui peut-être ne lui appartient\r\n    pas, comme nous le montrerons plus loin, il s'est nommé chez les Grecs\r\n    le plus souvent [Greek: êlektron] au neutre,^1 mais aussi [Greek:\r\n    êlektros] au masculin^2 et même au féminin,^3 [Greek:\r\n    chrusêlektros],^4 [Greek: chrusophoros]^5 et peut-être, comme nous\r\n    l'avons vu, [Greek: chalkolithanon]; plus tard [Greek: souchion]^6 ou\r\n    [Greek: souchinos]^7, et [Greek: êlektrianos lithos];^8 plus tard\r\n    encore [Greek: berenikê], [Greek: beronikê] ou [Greek: bernikê];^9 il\r\n    s'est nommé [Greek: harpax] chez les Grecs établis en Syrie;^{10} chez\r\n    les Latins _succinum_, _electrum_, et deux variétés, _chryselectrum_ et\r\n    _sualiternicum_ {33} ou _subalternicum_;^{11} chez les Germains,\r\n    _Gless_;^{12} chez les Scythes, _sacrium_;^{13} chez les Egyptiens,\r\n    _sacal_;^{14} chez les Arabes, _karabé_^{15} ou _kahraba_;^{16} en\r\n    persan, _káruba_.^{17} Ce mot, qui appartient bien à la langue persane,\r\n    y signifie _attirant la paille_, et par conséquent exprime l'attraction\r\n    électrique, de même que le mot [Greek: harpax] des Grecs de Syrie. En\r\n    outre, le nom de _haur roumi_ (_peuplier romain_) était donné par les\r\n    Arabes, non-seulement à l'arbre dont ils croyaient que le succin était\r\n    la gomme, mais au succin lui-même. _Haur roumi_, transformé en _aurum_\r\n    par les traducteurs latins des auteurs arabes, et consondu mal à propos\r\n    avec _ambar_ ou _ambrum_, nom arabe latinisé de l'ambre gris, a produit\r\n    le nom moderne d'_ambre_, nom commun à l'_ambre jaune_ ou succin, qui\r\n    est une résine fossile, et à l'_ambre gris_, concrétion odorante qui se\r\n    forme dans les intestines des cachalots. On ne peut dire avec certitude\r\n    si le nom de basse grécité [Greek: bernikê] est la source ou le dérivé\r\n    de _Bern_, radical du nom allemand du succin (_Bernstein_). Quoi qu'il\r\n    en soit, le mot [Greek: bernikê] a produit _vernix_, nom d'une gomme\r\n    dans la basse latinité, d'où nous avons fait _vernis_.^{18}\"\r\n\r\n    ^1 Voyez Hérodote, III., 115; Platon, _Timée_, p. 80 c; Aristote,\r\n    _Météor._, IV., 10; Théophraste, _Hist. des plantes_, IX., 18 (19), §\r\n    2; _Des pierres_, § 28 et 29; Diodore de Sic., V., 23; Strabon, IV., 6,\r\n    n^o 2, p. 202 (Casaubon); Dioscoride, _Mat. méd._, I., 110; Plutarque,\r\n    _Questions de table_, II., 7, § 1; _Questions platoniques_, VII., 1 et\r\n    7; Lucien, _Du succin et des cygnes_; le même, _De Pastrologie_, § 19;\r\n    S.

Carab enim\r\nsignificat offerre Arabicè; ita Carabe, res oblata; aut rapiens paleas, vt\r\nScaliger ex Abohali citat, ex linguâ Arabicâ, vel Persicâ._--The printed\r\ntext, line 18, has \"Non rapiens paleas,\" but in all copies of the folio of\r\n1600, the \"Non\" has been altered in ink into \"aut,\" possibly by Gilbert's\r\nown hand. Nevertheless the editions of 1628 and 1633 both read \"Non.\" There\r\nappears to be no doubt that the origin of the word _Carabe_, or _Karabe_,\r\nas assigned by Scaliger, is substantially correct. As shown in the\r\npreceding note, Martin adopted this view. If any doubt should remain it\r\nwill be removed by the following notes which are due to Mr. A. Houtum\r\nSchindler (member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers), of Terahan.\r\n\r\nReference is made to the magnetic and electric properties of stones in\r\nthree early Persian lapidaries. There are three stones only mentioned,\r\namber, loadstone, and garnet. The electric property of the diamond is not\r\nmentioned. The following extracts are from the _Tansûk nâmah_, by Nasîr ed\r\ndîn Tûsi, A.D. 1260. The two other treatises give the first extracts in the\r\nsame words.\r\n\r\n\"_Kâhrubâ_, also _Kahrabâ_ [Amber],\r\n\r\n\"Is yellow and transparent, and has its name from the property, which it\r\npossesses, of attracting small, dry pieces of straw or grass, after it has\r\nbeen rubbed with cloth and become warm. [Note. In Persian, Kâh = straw;\r\nrubâ = the robber, hence Kâhrubâ = the straw-robber.] Some consider it a\r\nmineral, and say that it is found in the Mediterranean and Caspian seas,\r\nfloating on the surface, but this is not correct. The truth is that Kâhrubâ\r\n{34} is the gum of a tree, called jôz i rûmî [_i.e._, roman nut; walnut?],\r\nand that most of it is brought from Rûm [here the Eastern Rome] and from\r\nthe confines of Sclavonia and Russia. On account of its bright colour and\r\ntransparency it is made into beads, rings, belt-buckles, &c. ... &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The properties of attraction and repulsion are possessed by other\r\nsubstances than loadstone, for instance, by amber and bîjâdah,^1 which\r\nattract straws, feathers, etc., and of many other bodies, it can be said\r\nthat they possess the power of attraction. There is also a stone which\r\nattracts gold; it has a pure yellow colour. There is also a stone which\r\nattracts silver from distances of three or two yards. There are also the\r\nstone which attracts tin, very hard, and smelling like asafoetida, the\r\nstone attracting hair, the stone attracting meat, etc., but, latterly, no\r\none has seen these stones: no proof, however, that they do not exist.\"\r\n\r\nAvicenna (Ibn Sinâ) gives the following under the heading of _Karabe_ (see\r\n_Canona Medicinæ_, Giunta edition, Venet., 1608, lib. ii., cap. 371, p.\r\n336):\r\n\r\n\"Karabe quid est? Gumma sicut sandaraca, tendens ad citrinitatem, &\r\nalbedinem, & peruietatem, & quandoque declinat ad rubedinem, quæ attrahit\r\npaleas, & [fracturas] plantarum ad se, & propter hoc nominatur Karabe,\r\nscilicet rapiens paleas, persicè.... Karabe confert tremori cordis, quum\r\nbibitur ex eo medietas aurei cum aqua frigida, & prohibet sputum sanguinis\r\nvalde.... Retinet vomitum, & prohibet materias malas a stomacho, & cum\r\nmastiche confortat stomachum.... Retinet fluxum sanguinis ex matrice, &\r\nano, & fluxum ventris, & confert tenasmoni.\"\r\n\r\nScaliger in _De Subtilitate_, _Exercitatio_ ciii., § 12, the passage\r\nreferred to by Gilbert says: \"Succinum apud Arabas uocatur, Carabe: quod\r\nprinceps Aboali, rapiens paleas, interpretatur\" (p. 163 _bis_, editio\r\nLutetiæ, 1557).\r\n\r\n    ^1 _Bîjâdah_ is classified by Muhammad B. Mansûr (A.D. 1470) and by Ibn\r\n    al Mubârak (A.D. 1520) under \"stones resembling ruby\"; the Tansûk nâmah\r\n    describes it in a separate chapter. From the description it can be\r\n    identified with the almandine garnet, and the method of cutting this\r\n    stone _en cabochon_, with hollow back in order to display its colour\r\n    better is specially mentioned. The Tansûk nâmah only incidentally\r\n    refers to the electric property of the _bîjâdah_ in the chapter on\r\n    loadstone, but the other two treatises specially refer to it in their\r\n    description of the stone. The one has: \"_Bîjâdah_ if rubbed until warm,\r\n    attracts straws and other light bodies just as amber does\"; the other:\r\n    \"_Bîjâdah_, if rubbed on the hair of the head, or on the beard,\r\n    attracts straws.\" Surûri, the lexicographer, who compiled a dictionary\r\n    in 1599, considers the _bîjâdah_ \"a red ruby which possesses the\r\n    property of attraction.\" Other dictionaries do not mention the\r\n    attractive property, but some authors confound the stone with amber,\r\n    calling it _Kâbrubâ_, the straw-robber. The _bîjâdah_ is not rubellite\r\n    (red tourmaline) for it is described in the lapidaries as common,\r\n    whereas rubellite (from Ceylon) has always been rare, and was unknown\r\n    in Persia in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n[111] PAGE 47, LINE 21.

Dioscoridis de materia medica_, Frankfurt,\r\n1596, p. 133) comments on the suggestion of Galen that amber came from the\r\n_Populus alba_, and also comments on the Arabic, Greek, and Latin names of\r\namber.\r\n\r\nThe poplar-myth is commemorated by Addison (in _Italy_) in the lines:\r\n\r\n  No interwoven reeds a garland made,\r\n  To hide his brows within the vulgar shade;\r\n  But poplar wreathes around his temples spread,\r\n  And tears of amber trickled down his head.\r\n\r\nAmber is, however, assuredly not derived from any poplar tree: it comes\r\nfrom a species of pine long ago extinct, called by Göppert the _pinites\r\nsuccinifer_.\r\n\r\nGilbert does not go into the medicinal uses, real or fancied, that have\r\nbeen ascribed to amber in almost as great variety as to loadstone. Pliny\r\nmentions some of these in his _Natural Historie_ (English version of 1601,\r\np. 609):\r\n\r\n\"He [Callistratus] saith of this yellow Amber, that if it be worne about\r\nthe necke in a collar, it cureth feavers, and healeth the diseases of the\r\nmouth, throat, and jawes: reduced into pouder and tempered with honey and\r\noile of roses, it is soveraigne for the infirmities of the eares. Stamped\r\ntogether with the best Atticke honey, it maketh a singular eyesalve for to\r\nhelp a dim sight: pulverized, and the pouder thereof taken simply alone, or\r\nelse drunke in water with Masticke, is soveraigne for the maladies of the\r\nstomacke.\"\r\n\r\nNicolaus Myrepsus (Recipe 951, _op. citat._) gives a prescription for {36}\r\ndysentery and diabetes confiding chiefly of \"Electri vel succi Nili (Nili\r\nsuccum appellant Arabes Karabem).\"\r\n\r\n[112] PAGE 47, LINE 22.

Amongst the earliest works (after Theophrastus and Pliny) are\r\nthose of Aurifaber (_Bericht über Agtstein oder Börnstein_, Königsberg,\r\n1551); Goebel (_De Succino, Libri duo, authore Severino Goebelio, Medico\r\nDoctore_, Regiomont., 1558); and Wigand (_Vera historia de Succino\r\nBorussico_, Jena, 1590). Later on Hartmann, P. J. (_Succini Prussici\r\nPhysica et civilis Historia_, Francofurti, 1677); and the splendid folio of\r\nNathaniel Sendel (_Historia Succinorum corpora aliena involventium_,\r\nLipsiæ, 1742), with its wealth of plates illustrating amber specimens, with\r\nthe various included fossil fauna and flora. Georgius Agricola (_De natura\r\nFossilium_, liber iv.), and Aldrovandi (_Musæeum Metallicum_, pp. 411-412)\r\nmust also be mentioned. Bibliographies of the earlier literature are to be\r\nfound in Hartmann (_op. citat._), and in Daniel Gralath, _Elektrische\r\nBibliothek_ (_Versuche und Abhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft\r\nin Danzig_, Zweiter Theil, pp. 537-539, Danzig and Leipzig, 1754).

It is narrated in well-known passages in Ovid and in\r\nHyginus. Those interested in the modern handling of the myth should refer\r\nto Müllenhoff (_op. citat._, pp. 217-223, der Bernsteinmythus), or to that\r\ndelightful work _The Tears of the Heliades_, by W.

Holland's translation of 1601):\r\n\r\n\"That it doth destill and drop at the first very clear and liquid, it is\r\nevident by this argument, for that a man may see diverse things within, to\r\nwit, Pismires, Gnats, and Lizards, which no doubt were entangled and stucke\r\nwithin it when it was greene and fresh, and so remain enclosed within as it\r\nwaxed harder.\"\r\n\r\nA locust embedded in amber is mentioned in the _Musæum Septalianum_ of\r\nTerzagus (Dertonæ, 1664).\r\n\r\nMartial's epigram (_Epigrammata_, liber vi., 15) is well known:\r\n\r\n  Dum Phaethontea formica vagatur in umbra\r\n  Implicuit tenuem succina gutta feram.\r\n\r\nSee also Hermann (Daniel), _De rana et lacerta Succino Borussiaco insitis_\r\n{37} (Cracov., 1580; a later edition, Rigæ, 1600). The great work on\r\n_inclusa_ in amber is, however, that of Nathaniel Sendel. See the previous\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne must not be forgotten in this connexion. The\r\n_Pseudodoxia_ (p. 64 of the second edition, 1650) says:\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, we will not omit what Bellabonus upon his own experiment writ from\r\nDantzich unto Mellichius, as he hath left recorded in his chapter _De\r\nSuccino_, that the bodies of Flies, Pismires and the like, which are said\r\noft times to be included in Amber, are not reall but representative, as he\r\ndiscovered in severall pieces broke for that purpose. If so, the two famous\r\nEpigrams hereof in Martiall are but poeticall, the Pismire of Brassavolus\r\nImaginary, and Cardans Mousoleum for a flie, a meer phancy.

(Frankfurt, 1543, fol., liber quintus, cap.\r\nxcii.) is the following description:\r\n\r\n{38} \"In Gagatarum lapidum genere, præferendus qui celeriter accenditur, et\r\nodorem bituminis reddit. niger est plerunque, et squalidus, crustosus, per\r\nquam levis.

He seems to have taken a special\r\ndislike to Albertus Magnus, to Puteanus (Du Puys), and to Levinus Lemnius.\r\n\r\n[117] PAGE 47, LINE 39.

Five, if not six, other minerals had been named\r\nin addition to amber and jet.\r\n\r\n(1.) _Lyncurium._ This stone, about which there has been more obscurity and\r\nconfusion than about any other gem, is supposed by some writers to be the\r\ntourmaline, by others a jacinth, and by others a belemnite. The ancients\r\nsupposed it to be produced from the urine of the lynx. The following is the\r\naccount of Theophrastus, _Theophrastus's History of Stones. With an English\r\nVersion_ ..., by \"Sir\" John Hill, London, 1774, p. 123, ch. xlix.-l. \"There\r\nis some Workmanship required to bring the Emerald to its Lustre, for\r\noriginally it is not so bright. It is, however, excellent in its Virtues,\r\nas is also the _Lapis Lyncurius_, which is likewise used for engraving\r\nSeals on, and is of a very solid Texture, as Stones are; it has also an\r\nattractive Power, like that of Amber, and is said to attract not only\r\nStraws and small pieces of Sticks, but even Copper and Iron, if they are\r\nbeaten to thin pieces. This Diocles affirms. The _Lapis Lyncurius_ is\r\npellucid, and of a fire Colour.\" See also W. Watson in _Philos.

Hist._, book\r\nxxxvii., chap. vii. (p. 617 of English edition of 1601).\r\n\r\n{39} \"Over and besides, I find other sorts of Rubies different from those\r\nabove-named;... which being chaufed in the Sun, or otherwise set in a heat\r\nby rubbing with the fingers, will draw unto them chaffe, strawes, shreads,\r\nand leaves of paper. The common Grenat also of Carchedon or Carthage, is\r\nsaid to doe as much, although it be inferiour in price to the former.\"\r\n\r\n(4.) _Jasper._ Affaytatus is the authority, in _Fortunii Affaitati Physici\r\natque Theologi ... Physicæ & Astronomicæ c[=o]siderationes_ (Venet., 1549),\r\nwhere, on p. 20, he speaks of the magnet turning to the pole, likening it\r\nto the turning of a \"palea ab Ambro vel Iaspide et hujuscemodi lapillis\r\nlucidis.\"\r\n\r\n(5.) _Lychnis._ Pliny and St. Isidore speak of a certain stone _lychnis_,\r\nof a scarlet or flame colour, which, when warmed by the sun or between the\r\nfingers, attracts straws or leaves of papyrus. Pliny puts this stone\r\namongst carbuncles, but it is much more probably _rubellite_, that is to\r\nsay, red tourmaline.\r\n\r\n(6.) _Diamond._ In spite of the confusion already noted, _à propos_ of\r\n_adamas_ (Note to p. 47), between loadstone and diamond, there seems to be\r\none distinct record of an attractive effect having been observed with a\r\nrubbed diamond. This was recorded by Fracastorio, _De sympathia et\r\nantipathia rerum_ (Giunta edition, Venice, MDLXXIIII, chap. v., p. 60\r\n_verso_), \"cujus rei & illud esse signum potest, cum confricata quædã vt\r\nSuccinum, & Adamas fortius furculos trahunt.\" And (on p. 62 _recto_); \"nam\r\nsi per similitudine (vt supra diximus) fit hæc attractio, cur magnes non\r\npotius magnetem trahit, [~q] ferrum, & ferrum non potius ad ferrum movetur,\r\nquàm ad magnetem? quæ nam affinitas est pilorum, & furculorum cum Electro,\r\n& Adamante? præsertim [~q] si cum Electro affines sunt, quomodo & cum\r\nAdamante affinitatem habebunt, qui dissimilis Electro est?\" An\r\nincontestable case of the observation of the electrification of the diamond\r\noccurs in Gartias ab Horto. The first edition of his _Historia dei Semplici\r\nAromati_ was publisht at Goa in India in 1563. In chapter xlviii. on the\r\nDiamond, occur these words (p. 200 of the Venetian edition of 1616):\r\n\"Questo si bene ho sperimentato io più volte, che due Diamanti perfetti\r\nfregati insieme, si vniscono di modo insieme, che non di leggiero li potrai\r\nseparare. Et ho parimente veduto il Diamante dopo di esser ben riscaldato,\r\ntirare à se le festuche, non men, che si faccia l'elettro.\" See also\r\nAldrovandi, _Musæum Metallicum_ (Bonon., 1648, p. 947).\r\n\r\nLevinus Lemnius also mentions the Diamond along with amber. See his\r\n_Occulta naturæ miracula_ (English edition, London, 1658, p. 199).\r\n\r\n[119] PAGE 48, LINE 16. Page 48, line 18. _Iris gemma._--The name _iris_\r\nwas given, there can be little doubt, to clear six sided prisms of\r\nrock-crystal (quartz), which, when held in the sun's beams, cast a crude\r\nspectrum of the colours of the rainbow. The following is the account of it\r\ngiven in Pliny, book xxxvii., chap. vii. (p. 623 of the English version of\r\n1601):\r\n\r\n\"... there is a stone in name called Iris: digged out of the ground it is\r\nin a certaine Island of the red sea, distant from the city Berenice three\r\nscore miles. For the most part it resembleth Crystall: which is the reason\r\nthat some hath tearmed it the root of Crystall. But the cause why they call\r\nit Iris, is, That if the beames of the Sunne strike upon it directly within\r\nhouse, it doth send from it against the walls that bee neare, the very\r\nresemblance both in forme and also in colour of a rainebow; and eftsoones\r\nit will chaunge the same in much varietie, to the great admiration of them\r\nthat behold it. For certain it is knowne, that six angles it hath in manner\r\nof the Crystall: but they say that some of them have their sides rugged,\r\nand the same {40} unequally angled: which if they be laid abroad against\r\nthe Sunne in the open aire, do scatter the beames of the Sunne, which light\r\nupon them too and fro: also that others doe yeeld a brightnes from\r\nthemselves, and thereby illuminat all that is about them. As for the\r\ndiverse colours which they cast forth, it never happeneth but in a darke or\r\nshaddowie place: whereby a man may know, that the varietie of colours is\r\nnot in the stone Iris, but commeth by the reverberation of the wals. But\r\nthe best Iris is that which representeth the greatest circles upon the\r\nwall, and those which bee likest unto rainebowes indeed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the English translation of Solinus's _De Mirabilibus_ (_The excellent\r\nand pleasant worke of Julius Solinus containing the noble actions of\r\nhumaine creatures, the secretes and providence of nature, the descriptions\r\nof countries ... tr. by A. Golding, gent._, Lond., 1587), chapter xv. on\r\nArabia has the following:\r\n\r\n\"Hee findeth likewise the Iris in the Red sea, sixe cornered as the\r\nCrystall: which beeing touched with the Sunnebeames, casteth out of him a\r\nbryght reflexion of the ayre like the Raynebowe.\"\r\n\r\nIris is also mentioned by Albertus Magnus (_De mineralibus_, Venet., 1542,\r\np. 189), by Marbodeus Gallus (_De lapidibus_, Par. 1531, p. 78), who\r\ndescribes it as \"crystallo simulem sexangulam,\" by Lomatius (_Artes of\r\ncurious Paintinge_, Haydocke's translation, Lond., 1598, p. 157), who says,\r\n\"... the Sunne, which casting his beames vpon the _stone Iris_, causeth the\r\n_raine-bowe_ to appeare therein ...,\" and by \"Sir\" John Hill (_A General\r\nNatural History_, Lond., 1748, p. 179).\r\n\r\nFigures of the Iris given by Aldrovandi in the _Musæum Metallicum_ clearly\r\ndepict crystals of quartz.\r\n\r\n[120] PAGE 48, LINE 16. Page 48, line 18. _Vincentina, & Bristolla (Anglica\r\ngemma siue fluor)_. This is doubtless the same substance as the _Gemma\r\nVincentij rupis_ mentioned on p. 54, line 16 (p. 54, line 18, of English\r\nVersion), and is nothing else than the so-called \"Bristol diamond,\" a\r\nvariety of dark quartz crystallized in small brilliant crystals upon a\r\nbasis of hæmatite. To the work by Dr. Thomas Venner (Lond., 1650), entitled\r\n_Via Recta_ or the _Bathes of Bathe_, there is added an appendix, _A\r\nCensure concerning the water of Saint Vincents Rocks neer Bristol (Urbs\r\npulchra et Emporium celebre)_, in which, at p. 376, occurs this passage:\r\n\"This Water of Saint _Vincents_ Rock is of a very pure, cleare, crystalline\r\nsubstance, answering to those crystalline Diamonds and transparent stones\r\nthat are plentifully found in those Clifts.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Fossils Arranged_ of \"Sir\" John Hill (Lond., 1771), p. 123, is the\r\nfollowing entry: \"Black crystal. Small very hard heavy glossy. Perfectly\r\nblack, opake. Bristol (grottos, glass)\" referring to its use.\r\n\r\nThe name _Vincentina_ is not known as occurring in any mineralogical book.\r\nProf. H. A. Miers, F.R.S., writes concerning the passage: \"_Anglica gemma\r\nsive fluor_ seems to be a synonym for _Bristolla_, or possibly for\r\n_Vincentina et Bristolla_. Both quartz and fluor are found at Clifton. In\r\nthat case Vincentina and Bristolla refer to these two minerals, and if so\r\none would expect Bristolla to be the Bristol Diamond, and Vincentina to be\r\nthe comparatively rare Fluor spar from that locality.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the edition of 1653 of Sir Hugh Plat's _Jewel House of Art\r\nand Nature_, is appended _A rare and excellent Discourse of Minerals,\r\nStones, Gums, and Rosins; with the vertues and use thereof_, By D. B.\r\n_Gent_. Here, p. 218, we read:\r\n\r\n\"We have in England a stone or mineral called a Bristol stone (because {41}\r\nmany are found thereabouts) which much resembles the Adamant or Diamond,\r\nwhich is brought out of Arabia and Cyprus; but as it is wanting of the same\r\nhardnesse, so falls it short of the like vertues.\"\r\n\r\n[121] PAGE 48, LINE 18.

Pliny's account of it (Philemon Holland's version of 1601, p. 604)\r\nin book xxxvii., chap, ii., is:\r\n\r\n\"As touching Crystall, it proceedeth of a contrarie cause, namely of cold;\r\nfor a liquor it is congealed by extreame frost in manner of yce; and for\r\nproofe hereof, you shall find crystall in no place els but where the winter\r\nsnow is frozen hard: so as we may boldly say, it is verie yce and nothing\r\nelse, whereupon the Greeks have give it the right name Crystallos, _i._\r\nYce.... Thus much I dare my selfe avouch, that crystall groweth within\r\ncertaine rockes upon the Alps, and these so steepe and inaccessible, that\r\nfor the most part they are constrained to hang by ropes that shall get it\r\nforth.\"\r\n\r\n[122] PAGE 48, LINE 18. Page 48, line 20. _Similes etiam attrahendi vires\r\nhabere videntur vitrum ... sulphur, mastix, & cera dura sigillaris._ If, as\r\nshown above, the electric powers of diamond and ruby had already been\r\nobserved, yet Gilbert was the first beyond question to extend the list of\r\n_electrics_ beyond the class of precious stones, and his discovery that\r\n_glass_, _sulphur_, and _sealing-wax_ acted, when rubbed, like amber, was\r\nof capital importance. Though he did not pursue the discovery into\r\nmechanical contrivances, he left the means of that extension to his\r\nfollowers. To Otto von Guericke we owe the application of sulphur to make\r\nthe first electrical machine out of a revolving globe; to Sir Isaac Newton\r\nthe suggestion of glass as affording a more mechanical construction.\r\n\r\nElectrical attraction by natural products other than amber after they have\r\nbeen rubbed must have been observed by the primitive races of mankind.\r\nIndeed Humboldt in his _Cosmos_ (Lond., 1860, vol. i., p. 182) records a\r\nstriking instance:\r\n\r\n\"I observed with astonishment, on the woody banks of the Orinoco, in the\r\nsports of the natives, that the excitement of electricity by friction was\r\nknown to these savage races, who occupy the very lowest place in the scale\r\nof humanity. Children may be seen to rub the dry, flat and shining seeds or\r\nhusks of a trailing plant (probably a _Negretia_) until they are able to\r\nattract threads of cotton and pieces of bamboo cane.\"\r\n\r\n[123] PAGE 48, LINE 23.

It is\r\nrepeated by Marbodeus and was quoted by Levinus Lemnius as true. Gilbert\r\ndenounced it as nonsense. Cardan (_De Subtilitate_, Norimb., 1550, p. 132)\r\nhad already contradicted the fable. \"Trahit enim,\" he says, \"omnia levia,\r\npaleas, festucas, ramenta {42} tenuia metallorum, & ocimi folia, perperam\r\ncontradicente Theophrasto.\" Sir Thomas Browne specifically refuted it. \"For\r\nif,\" he says, \"the leaves thereof or dried stalks be stripped into small\r\nstrawes, they arise unto Amber, Wax, and other Electricks, no otherwise\r\nthen those of Wheat or Rye.\"\r\n\r\n[127] PAGE 48, LINE 34. Page 48, line 38. _Sed vt poteris manifestè\r\nexperiri...._\r\n\r\nGilbert's experimental discoveries in electricity may be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  1.  The generalization of the class of _Electrics_.\r\n  2.  The observation that damp weather hinders electrification.\r\n  3.  The generalization that electrified bodies attract everything,\r\n      including even metals, water, and oil.\r\n  4.  The invention of the non-magnetic _versorium_ or electroscope.\r\n  5.  The observation that merely warming amber does not electrify it.\r\n  6.  The recognition of a definite class of _non-electrics_.\r\n  7.  The observation that certain electrics do not attract if roasted or\r\n      burnt.\r\n  8.  That certain electrics when softened by heat lose their power.\r\n  9.  That the electric effluvia are stopped by the interposition of a\r\n      sheet\r\n      of paper or a piece of linen, or by moist air blown from the mouth.\r\n  10. That glowing bodies, such as a live coal, brought near excited amber\r\n      discharge its power.\r\n  11. That the heat of the sun, even when concentrated by a burning mirror,\r\n      confers no vigour on the amber, but dissipates the effluvia.\r\n  12. That sulphur and shell-lac when aflame are not electric.\r\n  13. That polish is not essential for an electric.\r\n  14. That the electric attracts bodies themselves, not the intervening\r\n      air.\r\n  15. That flame is not attracted.\r\n  16. That flame destroys the electrical effluvia.\r\n  17. That during south winds and in damp weather, glass and crystal, which\r\n      collect moisture on their surface, are electrically more interfered\r\n      with than amber, jet and sulphur, which do not so easily take up\r\n      moisture on their surfaces.\r\n  18. That pure oil does not hinder production of electrification or\r\n      exercise\r\n      of attraction.\r\n  19. That smoke is electrically attracted, unless too rare.\r\n  20. That the attraction by an electric is in a straight line toward it.\r\n\r\n[128] PAGE 48, LINE 35. Page 48, line 39. _quæ sunt illæ\r\nmateriæ._--Gilbert's list of electrics should be compared with those given\r\nsubsequently by Cabeus (1629), by Sir Thomas Browne (1646), and by Bacon.\r\nThe last-named list occurs in his _Physiological Remains_, published\r\nposthumously in 1679; it contains nothing new. Sir Thomas Browne's list is\r\ngiven in the following passage, which is interesting as using for the first\r\ntime in the English language the noun _Electricities_:\r\n\r\n\"Many stones also both precious and vulgar, although terse and smooth, have\r\nnot this power attractive; as Emeralds, Pearle, Jaspis, Corneleans, Agathe,\r\nHeliotropes, Marble, Alablaster, Touchstone, Flint and Bezoar. Glasse\r\nattracts but weakely though cleere, some slick stones and thick glasses\r\nindifferently: Arsenic but weakely, so likewise glasse of Antimony, but\r\nCrocus Metallorum not at all. Saltes generally but weakely, as Sal Gemma,\r\nAlum, and also Talke, nor very discoverably by any frication: but if gently\r\nwarmed at the fire, and wiped with a dry cloth, they will better discover\r\ntheir Electricities.\" _(Pseudodoxia Epidemica_, p. 79.)\r\n\r\nIn the _Philosophical Transactions_, vol. xx., p. 384, is _A Catalogue of\r\nElectrical Bodies_ by the late Dr. Rob. Plot. It begins \"Non solum\r\nsuccinum,\" and ends \"alumen rupeum,\" being identical with Gilbert's list\r\nexcept that he calls \"Vincentina & Bristolla\" by the name \"Pseudoadamas\r\nBristoliensis.\"\r\n\r\n[129] PAGE 49, LINE 25. Page 49, line 30. _non dissimili modo._--The\r\n_modus_ {43} _operandi_ of the electrical attractions was a subject of much\r\ndiscussion; see Cardan, _op. citat._\r\n\r\n[130] PAGE 51, LINE 2.

Page 52, line 41. _duæ propositæ sunt causæ ...\r\nmateria & forma._--Gilbert had imbibed the schoolmen's ideas as to the\r\nrelations of matter and form. He had discovered and noted that in the\r\nmagnetic attractions there was always a verticity, and that in the\r\nelectrical attractions the rubbed electrical body had no verticity. To\r\naccount for these differences he drew the inference that since (as he had\r\nsatisfied himself) the magnetic actions were due to _form_, that is to say\r\nto something immaterial--to an \"imponderable\" as in the subsequent age it\r\nwas called--the electrical actions must necessarily be due to _matter_. He\r\ntherefore put forward his idea that a substance to be an electric must\r\nnecessarily consist of a concreted humour which is partially resolved into\r\nan effluvium by attrition. His discoveries that electric actions would not\r\npass through flame, whilst magnetic actions would, and that electric\r\nactions could be screened off by interposing the thinnest layer of fabric\r\nsuch as sarcenet, whilst magnetic actions would penetrate thick slabs of\r\nevery material except iron only, doubtless confirmed him in attributing the\r\nelectric forces to the presence of these effluvia. See also p. 65. There\r\narose a fashion, which lasted over a century, for ascribing to \"humours,\"\r\nor \"fluids,\" or \"effluvia,\" physical effects which could not otherwise be\r\naccounted for. Boyle's tracts of the years 1673 and 1674 on \"effluviums,\"\r\ntheir \"determinate nature,\" their \"strange subtilty,\" and their \"great\r\nefficacy,\" are examples.\r\n\r\n[135] PAGE 53, LINE 9.

Page 60, line 12. _Differentia inter magnetica &\r\nelectrica._--Though Gilbert was the first systematically to explore the\r\ndifferences that exist between the magnetic attraction of iron and the\r\nelectric attraction of all light substances, the point had not passed\r\nunheeded, for we find St. Augustine, in the _De Civitate Dei_, liber xxi.,\r\ncap. 6, raising the question why the loadstone which attracts iron should\r\nrefuse to move straws. The many analogies between electric and magnetic\r\nphenomena had led many experimenters to speculate on the possibility of\r\nsome connexion between electricity and magnetism. See, for example,\r\nTiberius Cavallo, _A Treatise on Magnetism_, London, 1787, p. 126. Also the\r\nthree volumes of J. H. van Swinden, _Receuil de Mémoires sur l'Analogie de\r\nElectricité et du Magnétisme_, La Haye, 1784. Aepinus wrote a treatise on\r\nthe subject, entitled _De Similitudine vis electricæ et magneticæ_\r\n(Petropolis, 1758). This was, of course, long prior to the discovery, by\r\nOersted, in 1820, of the real connexion between magnetism and the electric\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n[146] PAGE 60, LINE 25.

By the famous and learned C.\r\nCusanus._ In the fourth book _of statick Experiments, Or experiments of the\r\nBallance_, occurs (p. 186) the following:\r\n\r\n    \"_Orat._ Tell me, if thou hast any device whereby the vertues of stones\r\n    may be weighed.\r\n\r\n    \"_Id._ I thinke the vertue of the Load-stone might be weighed, if\r\n    putting some Iron in one scale, and a Load-stone in the other, untill\r\n    the ballance were even, then taking away the Load-stone, and some other\r\n    thing of the same weight being put into the scale, the Load-stone were\r\n    holden over the Iron, so that that scale wou'd begin to rise; by reason\r\n    of the Load-stones attraction of the Iron, then take out some of the\r\n    weight of the other scale, untill the scale wherein the iron is, doe\r\n    sinke againe to the æquilibrium, or equality still holding the\r\n    Load-stone unmovable as it was; I beleeve that by weight of what was\r\n    taken out of the contrary scale, one might come proportionably to the\r\n    weight of the vertue or power of the Load-stone. And in like manner,\r\n    the vertue of a Diamond, might be found hereby, because {46} they say\r\n    it hinders the Load-stone from drawing of Iron; and so other vertues of\r\n    other stones, consideration, being alwayes had of the greatnesse of the\r\n    bodyes, because in a greater body, there is a greater power and\r\n    vertue.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 1588 edition of Baptista Porta's _Magiæ Naturalis Libri xx._, in\r\nlib. vii., cap. xviii., occurs the description of the use of the balance to\r\nwhich Gilbert refers.\r\n\r\n[157] PAGE 67, LINE 21.

There is a passage in Scaliger's _De Subtilitate ad Cardanum_\r\n(Exercitat.

Sed actus ille est [Greek:\r\nentelecheia], nõ autem [Greek: ergon]. At Magnetis attractio est [Greek:\r\nergon], non aut[~e] [Greek: entelecheia].\" To which Gilbert retorts: \"non\r\nactio unius, utriusque [Greek: entelecheia]; non [Greek: ergon], [Greek:\r\nsunentelecheia] et conactus potius quam sympathia.\" He returns on p. 70 to\r\nthe attack on Scaliger's metaphysical notions. There is a parallel passage\r\nin the _Epitome Naturalis Scientiæ_ of Daniel Sennert (Oxoniæ, 1664), in\r\nthe chapter _De Motu_.\r\n\r\n[161] PAGE 71, LINE 4.

Page 77, line 2. _multo magis._--This is an _à\r\nfortiori_ argument. It is interesting to find Gilbert comparing the\r\nvelocity of propagation of magnetic forces in space with the velocity of\r\nlight. The parallel is completed in line 13 by the consideration that as\r\nthe rays of light require to fall upon an object in order that they may\r\nbecome visible, so the magnetic forces require a magnetic object in order\r\nto render their presence sensible.\r\n\r\n[166] PAGE 78, LINE 14.

Page 83, line 5. _magnes longior maiora pondera\r\nferri attollit._--Gilbert discovered the advantage, for an equal mass of\r\nloadstone, of an elongated shape.

Page 83, line 28. _Non obstant crassa\r\ntabulata._--Gilbert has several times referred (_e.g._, on p. 77) to the\r\nway in which magnetic forces penetrate solid bodies. The experimental\r\ninvestigation in this chapter {47} is the more interesting because it shows\r\nthat Gilbert clearly perceived the shielding action of iron to be due to\r\niron conducting aside or diverting the magnetic forces.\r\n\r\n[169] PAGE 85, LINE 26.

It must\r\ntherefore be rendered _that which is exhaled_ (_i.e._, breathed out).\r\n\r\n[171] PAGE 86, LINE 13. Page 86, line 15. _Ita tota interposita moles\r\nterrestris._--Gilbert's notion that the gravitational force of the moon in\r\nproducing the tides acts _through_ the substance of the earth may seem\r\ncuriously expressed. But the underlying contention is essentially true\r\nto-day. The force of gravity is not cut off or screened off by the\r\ninterposition of other masses. A recent investigation by Professor\r\nPoynting, F.R.S., has shown that so far as all evidence goes all bodies,\r\neven the densest, are transparent with respect to gravitational forces.\r\n\r\n[172] PAGE 86, LINE 18. Page 86, line 20. _Sed de æstus ratione\r\naliàs._--There is no further discussion of the tides in _De Magnete_. But a\r\nshort account is to be found in Gilbert's posthumous work _De Mundo nostro\r\nSublunari Philosophia nova_ (Amsterdam, Elzevir, 1651), in Lib. v., the\r\npart which in the manuscript was left in English, and was turned into Latin\r\nby his brother. It comprises about fifteen quarto pages, from Cap. X. to\r\nCap. XIX. inclusive, beginning with a characteristic diatribe against\r\nTaisnier, Levinus Lemnius, and Scaliger. But in assigning causes he himself\r\ngoes wide of the mark. Proceeding by a process of elimination he first\r\nshows that the moon's light cannot be the cause that impels the tides.\r\n\"Luna,\" he says, \"non radio, non lumine, maria impellit. quomodo igitur?\r\nSane corporum conspiratione, acque (ut similitudine rem exponam) Magnetica\r\nattractione.\" This cryptic utterance he proceeds to explain by a diagram,\r\nand adds: \"Quare Luna non tam attrahit mare, quàm humorem & spiritum\r\nsubterraneum; nec plus resistit interposita terra, quàm mensa, aut quicquam\r\naliud densum, aut crassum, magnetis viribus.\"\r\n\r\n[173] PAGE 87, LINE 7. Page 87, line 9. _armatura._--Here this means the\r\ncap or snout of iron with which the loadstone was armed. This is apparently\r\nthe first use of the term in this sense.\r\n\r\nIn the _Dialogues of Galileo_ (p. 369 of Salusbury's _Mathematical\r\nCollections_, Dialogue iii.), Sagredus and Salviatus discuss the arming of\r\nthe loadstone, and the increased lifting power conferred by adding an iron\r\ncap. Salviatus mentions a loadstone in the Florentine Academy which,\r\nunarmed, weighed six ounces, lifting only two ounces, but which when armed\r\ntook up 160 ounces. Whereupon Galileo makes Salviatus say: \"I extreamly\r\npraise, admire, and envy this Authour, for that a conceit so stupendious\r\nshould come into his minde. ...

It is here\r\nclearly used in the sense of _mutual tendency toward union_. Note also the\r\ncontrasted use in chap. xx. of the verbs _cohære_ and _adhære_. Adhærence\r\nconnotes a one-sided force (an impossibility in physics), cohærence a\r\nmutual force.\r\n\r\n[177] PAGE 90, LINE 9.

Only so recently as 1861 Siemens patented the device of\r\nfastening a mass of iron to one end of an electromagnet in order to\r\nincrease the power of the other end. The fact, so far as it relates to\r\npermanent magnets was known to Servington Savery. See _Philos.\r\nTransactions_, 1729, p. 295.\r\n\r\n[178] PAGE 92, LINE 3.

Why I think it\r\nextream hard, I shall say afterwards. But I say it may be done, because I\r\nhave now done it, to hold it fast by an invisible band, to hang in the air;\r\nonely so, that it be bound with a small thread beneath, that it may not\r\nrise higher: and then striving to catch hold of the stone above, it will\r\nhang in the air, and tremble and wag itself.\"\r\n\r\n[179] PAGE 97, LINE 29. Page 97, line 33. _Sed quæri potest ..._--The\r\nquestion here raised by Gilbert is whether the lifting-power of magnets of\r\nequal quality is proportional to their weight. If a stone weighing a drachm\r\nwill lift a drachm, would a stone that weighs an ounce lift an ounce?\r\nGilbert erroneously answers that this is so, and that the lifting-power of\r\na loadstone, whether armed or unarmed, is proportional to its mass.\r\n\r\nThe true law of the tractive force or lifting-power of magnets was first\r\ngiven in 1729 by James Hamilton (afterwards Earl of Abercorn) in a work\r\nentitled _Calculations and Tables Relating to the Attractive Virtue of\r\nLoadstones ... Printed_ [at London?] _in the Year_ 1729. (See also a paper\r\nin the _Philos. Transactions_, 1729-30, vol. xxxvi., p. 245). This work\r\nbegins thus:\r\n\r\n\"The Principle upon which these Tables are formed, is this: That if Two\r\n_Loadstones_ are perfectly Homogeneous, that is, if their Matter be of the\r\nsame Specifick Gravity, and of the same Virtue in all Parts of one Stone,\r\nas in the other; and that Like Parts of their Surfaces are Cap'd or Arm'd\r\nwith Iron; then the Weights they sustain will be as the Squares of the Cube\r\nRoots of the Weights of the _Loadstones_; that is, as their Surfaces.\"\r\n\r\nUpon lifting-power see also D. Bernoulli, _Acta Helvetica_, iii., p. 223,\r\n1758; P. W. Haecker, _Zur Theorie des Magnetismus_, Nürnberg, 1856; Van der\r\nWilligen, _Arch. du Musée Teyler_, vol. iv., Haarlem, 1878 ; S. P.\r\nThompson, _Philos. Magazine_, July, 1888.\r\n\r\nIn the book of James Hamilton, p. 5, he mentions a small terrella weighing\r\n139 English grains, which would sustain no less than 23,760 grains, and was\r\nvalued at £21 13s. 10¾d.\r\n\r\n{49} In the _Musæum Septalianum_ of Terzagus (Dertonæ, 1664, p. 42) is\r\nmentioned a loadstone weighing twelve ounces which would lift sixty pounds\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton had a loadstone weighing 3 grains, which he wore in a\r\nring. It would lift 746 grains.\r\n\r\nThomson's _British Annual_, 1837, p. 354, gives the following reference:\r\n\"In the _Records of General Science_, vol. iii., p. 272, there is an\r\ninteresting description of a very powerful magnet which was sent from\r\nVirginia in 1776 by the celebrated Dr. Franklin to Professor Anderson, of\r\nGlasgow. It is now in the possession of Mr. Crichton. It weighs 2½ grains,\r\nand is capable of supporting a load of 783 grains, which is equivalent to\r\n313 times its own weight.\"\r\n\r\n[180] PAGE 99, LINE 10. Page 99, line 11. _Manifestum est._--In this, as in\r\nmany other passages, Gilbert uses this expression in the sense that _it is\r\ndemonstrable_ rather than meaning that _it is obvious_: for the fact here\r\ndescribed is one that is not at all self-evident, but one which would\r\nbecome plain when the experiment had been tried. For other instances of\r\nthis use of _manifestum_ see pages 144, line 20; 158, line 19; 162, line\r\n10.\r\n\r\n[181] PAGE 100, LINE 20.

Electrical\r\nrepulsion was first observed by Nicolas Cabeus, _Philosophia Magnetica_,\r\nFerrara, 1629; but first systematically announced by Otto von Guericke in\r\nhis treatise _Experimenta Nova (ut vocantur) Magdeburgica, de Vacuo Spatio_\r\n(Amstel., 1672).\r\n\r\n[195] PAGE 113, LINE 29.

Only in one place (p. 101, line 5) does Gilbert\r\nspeak of _cuspis meridionalis_. Everywhere else the south-pointing end is\r\ncalled the _crux_.\r\n\r\n[199] PAGE 118, LINE 15. Page 118, line 13. _nam æquè potens est._--Later\r\nobservation showed this view to be incorrect. The horizontal component of\r\nthe earth's magnetic field is not equally strong all over the globe, and\r\nthe sluggishness of the needle's return to its position of rest is not due\r\nto the supporting pin becoming blunt with wear. The value of the horizontal\r\ncomponent is zero at the north magnetic pole, and increases toward the\r\nmagnetic equator. It is greatest near Singapore and in Borneo, being there\r\nmore than twice as great as it is at London. (See Captain Creak in _Report\r\nof Voyage of H.M.S.

There is a curious history to this picture of the\r\nblacksmith in his smithy striking the iron while it lies north and south,\r\nand so magnetizing it under the influence of the earth's magnetism.\r\nWoodcuts containing human figures are comparatively rare in English art of\r\nthe sixteenth century; a notable exception being Foxe's _Acts and\r\nMonuments_ with its many crude cuts of martyrdoms. The artist who prepared\r\nthis cut of the smith took the design from an illustrated book of Fables by\r\none Cornelius Kiliani or Cornelius van Kiel entitled _Viridarium Moralis\r\nPhilosophiæ, per Fabulas Animalibus brutis attributas traditæ, etc._\r\n(Coloniæ, 1594). This rare work, of which there is no copy in the British\r\nMuseum, is illustrated by some 120 fine copper-plate etchings printed in\r\nthe text. On p. 133 of this work is an etching to illustrate the fable\r\n_Ferrarii fabri et canis_, representing the smith smiting iron on the\r\nanvil, whilst his lazy dog sleeps beneath the bellows. The cut on p. 139 of\r\nGilbert gives, as will be seen by a comparison of the pictures just the\r\nsame general detail of forge and tools; but the position of the smith is\r\nreversed right for left, the dog is omitted, and the words _Septrenio_ and\r\n_Auster_ have been added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the Stettin edition of 1628 the picture has again been turned into a\r\ncopper-plate etching separately printed, is reversed back again left for\r\nright, while a compass-card is introduced in the corner to mark the\r\nnorth-south direction.\r\n\r\nIn the Stettin edition of 1633 the artist has gone back to Kiliani's\r\noriginal {53} plate, and has re-etched the design very carefully, but\r\nreversing it all right for left. As in the London version of 1600, the dog\r\nis omitted, and the words _Septentrio_ and _Auster_ are added. Some of the\r\noriginal details--for example, the vice and one pair of pincers--are left\r\nout, but other details, for instance, the cracks in the blocks that support\r\nthe water-tub, and the dress of the blacksmith, are rendered with slavish\r\nfidelity.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps needless to remark that the twelve copper-plate etchings in\r\nthe edition of 1628, and the twelve completely different ones in that of\r\n1633, replace certain of the woodcuts of the folio of 1600. For example,\r\ntake the woodcut on p. 203 of the 1600 edition, which represents a simple\r\ndipping-needle made by thrusting a versorium through a bit of cork and\r\nfloating it, immersed, in a goblet of water. In the 1633 edition this\r\nappears, slightly reduced, as a small inserted copper-plate, with nothing\r\nadded; but in the 1628 edition it is elaborated into a full-page plate (No.\r\nxi.) representing the interior, with shelves of books, of a library on the\r\nfloor of which stands the goblet--apparently three feet high--with a globe\r\nand an armillary sphere; while beside the goblet, with his back to the\r\nspectator, is seated an aged man, reading, in a carved armchair. This\r\nfigure and the view of the library are unquestionably\r\ncopied--reversed--from a well-known plate in the work _Le Diverse &\r\nArtificiose Machine_ of Agostino Ramelli (Paris, 1558).\r\n\r\nIn the Emblems of Jacob Cats (_Alle de Wercken_, Amsterdam, 1665, p. 65) is\r\ngiven an engraved plate of a smith's forge, which is also copied--omitting\r\nthe smith--from Kiliani's _Viridarium_.\r\n\r\n[212] PAGE 140, LINE 2..

The church was dedicated to St. John,\r\nbut in the custody of the Augustinian monks. The following is the account\r\nof it given by Aldrovandi, _Musæum Metallicum_ (1648, p. 134), on which\r\npage also two figures of it are given:\r\n\r\n\"Aliquando etiam ferrum suam mutat substantiam, dum in magnetem\r\nconuertitur, & hoc experientia constat, nam Arimini supra turrim templi S.\r\nIoannis erat Crux a baculo ferreo ponderis centum librarum sustentata, quod\r\ntractu temporis adeò naturam Magnetis est adeptum, vt, illivs instar,\r\nferrum traheret: hinc magna admiratione multi tenentur, qua ratione ferrum,\r\nquod est metallum in Magnetem, qui est lapis transmutari possit;\r\nAnimaduertendum est id à maxima familiaritate & sympathia ferri, & magnetis\r\ndimanare cum Aristoteles in habentibus symbolum facilem transitum semper\r\nadmiserit.

This was a thick Crust of Rust, part of which\r\nwas turned into a strong Loadstone, and had all the properties of a Stone\r\ndug out of the Mine. _Mons. de la Hire_ has Printed a Memoir of it; also\r\nMons. _de Vallemont_ a Treatise. The very outward Rust had no Magnetic\r\nVirtue, but the inward had a strong one, as to take up a third part more\r\nthan its weight unshod.\" Gassendi and Grimaldi have given other cases.\r\n\r\nOther examples of iron acquiring strong permanent magnetism from the earth\r\nare not wanting. The following is from Sir W. Snow Harris's _Rudimentary\r\nMagnetism_ (London, 1872, p. 10).\r\n\r\n\"In the _Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences_ for 1731, we find an account\r\nof a large bell at Marseilles having an axis of iron: this axis rested on\r\nstone blocks, and threw off from time to time great quantities of rust,\r\nwhich, mixing with the particles of stone and the oil used to facilitate\r\nthe motion, became conglomerated into a hardened mass: this mass had all\r\nthe properties of the native magnet. The bell is supposed to have been in\r\nthe same position for 400 years.\"\r\n\r\n[214] PAGE 142, LINE 13. Page 142, line 15. _tunc planetæ & corpora\r\ncoelestia._--Gilbert's extraordinary detachment from all metaphysical and\r\nultra-physical explanations of physical facts, and his continual appeal to\r\nthe test of experimental evidence, enabled him to lift the science of the\r\nmagnet out of the slough of the dark ages.

Though the\r\ndistinction between iron and steel was not at this time well established,\r\nthere is no reason to doubt that by _aciarium_ was meant edge-steel as used\r\nfor blades. Barlowe, in his _Magneticall Advertisements_ (Lond., 1616), p.\r\n66, gives minute instructions for the fashioning of the compass-needle. He\r\ngives the preference to a pointed oval form, and describes how the steel\r\nmust be hardened by heating to whiteness and quenching in water, so that it\r\nis \"brickle in a manner as glass it selfe,\" and then be tempered by\r\nreheating it over a bar of red hot iron until it is let down to a blue\r\ntint. Savery (_Philos. Trans._, 1729) appears to have been the first to\r\nmake a systematic examination of the magnetic differences between hard\r\nsteel and soft iron.\r\n\r\nInstructions for touching the needle are given in the _Arte de Nauegar_ of\r\nPedro de Medina (Valladolid, 1545, lib. vi., cap. 1).\r\n\r\n[217] PAGE 149, LINE 8.

Page 153, line 2. _Cardani ab ortu stellæ in cauda\r\nvrsæ._--What Cardan said (_De Subtilitate_, _Edit. citat._, p. 187) was:\r\n\"ortum stellæ in cauda ursæ minoris, quæ quinque partibus orientalior est\r\npolo mundi, respicit.\"\r\n\r\n[219] PAGE 153, LINE 21. Page 153, line 26. _sequitur quod versus terram\r\nmagnam, siue continentem ... à vero polo inclinatio magnetica\r\nfiat._--Gilbert {55} goes on to point out how, at that date, all the way up\r\nthe west European coast from Morocco to Norway, the compass is deflected\r\neastward, or toward the elevated land. He argued that this was a universal\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn _Purchas his Pilgrimes_ (Lond., 1625), in the Narrative, in vol. iii.,\r\nof Bylot and Baffin's Voyage of 1616, there is mentioned an island between\r\nWhale-Sound and Smith's Sound, where there had been observed a larger\r\nvariation than in any other part of the world. Purchas, in a marginal note,\r\ncomments on this as follows: \"Variation of the Compass 56° to the West,\r\nwhich may make questionable D. Gilbert's rule, tom. 1., l. 2, c. 1, that\r\nwhere more Earth is more attraction of the Compass happeneth by variation\r\ntowards it. Now the known Continents of Asia, &c., must be unspeakably more\r\nthan here there can be, & yet here is more variation then about Jepan,\r\nBrasil, or Peru, &c.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert's view was in truth founded on an incomplete set of facts. At that\r\ntime, as he tells us, the variation of the compass at London was 11-1/3\r\ndegrees eastward. But he did not know of the secular change which would in\r\nabout fifty-seven years reduce that variation to zero. Still less did he\r\nimagine that there would then begin a westward variation which in the year\r\n1816 should reach 24° 30', and which should then steadily diminish so that\r\nin the year 1900 it should stand at 16° 16' westward. For an early\r\ndiscussion of the changes of the variation see vol. i. of the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ (Abridged), p. 188. Still earlier is the\r\nclassical volume of Henry Gellibrand, _A Discovrse Mathematical on the\r\nVariation of the Magneticall Needle_ (Lond., 1635). Gilbert heads chapter\r\niii. of book iiii. (p. 159) with the assertion _Variatio uniuscuiusque loci\r\nconstans est_, declaring that to change it would require the upheaval of a\r\ncontinent. Gellibrand combats this on p. 7 of the work mentioned. He says:\r\n\r\n    \"Thus hitherto (according to the Tenents of all our _Magneticall_\r\n    Philosophers) we have supposed the variations of all particular places\r\n    to continue one and the same. So that when a Seaman shall happly\r\n    returne to a place where formerly he found the same variation, he may\r\n    hence conclude he is in the same former _Longitude_. For it is the\r\n    Assertion of _Mr. Dr. Gilberts_. _Variatio vnicuiusq; Loci constans\r\n    est_, that is to say, the same place doth alwayes retaine the same\r\n    variation. Neither hath this Assertion (for ought I ever heard) been\r\n    questioned by any man. But most diligent magneticall observations have\r\n    plainely offred violence to the same, and proved the contrary, namely\r\n    that the variation is accompanied with a variation.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1637 Henry Bond wrote in the _Sea-Mans Kalendar_ that in the year 1657\r\nthe variation would be zero at London. Compare Bond's _Longitude Found_\r\n(Lond., 1676, p. 3).\r\n\r\nAs to inconstancy of the variation in one place see further Fournier's\r\n_Hydrographie_ (Paris, 1667, liv. xi., ch. 12, p. 413), and Kircher,\r\n_Magnes_ (Colon. Agripp., 1643, p. 418).\r\n\r\n[220] PAGE 157, LINE 4.

It is found on the\r\nchart or windrose of the names of the winds on pp. 151 and 152 of the\r\n_Mécometrie de l'Eyman_ of G. Nautonier (1602). Here the name\r\n_Borrolybicus_ is given as a synonym for _Nortouest Galerne_, or [Greek:\r\nOlumpias], while the two winds on the points next on the western and\r\nnorthern sides respectively are called _Upocorus_ and _Upocircius_.\r\n\r\n{56} In Swan's _Specvlvm Mundi_ (Camb., 1643, p. 174) is this explanation:\r\n\"Borrholybicus is the North-west wind.\"\r\n\r\nIn Kircher's _Magnes_ (Colon. Agripp., 1643, p. 434) is a table of the\r\nnames of the thirty-two winds in six languages, where _Borrolybicus_ is\r\ngiven as the equivalent of _Maestro_ or _North-West_.\r\n\r\n[223] PAGE 161, LINE 2. Page 161, line 2. _Insula in Oceano variationem non\r\nmutat._--The conclusions derived from the magnetic explorations of the\r\nChallenger expedition, 1873-1876, are briefly these: That in islands north\r\nof the magnetic equator there is a tendency to produce a local\r\nperturbation, attracting the north-seeking end of the needle downwards, and\r\nhorizontally towards the higher parts of the land; while south of the\r\nmagnetic equator, the opposite effects are observed.

Page 165, line 2. _De pyxidis nauticæ vsitatæ\r\ncompositione._--Gilbert's description of the usual construction of the\r\nmariner's compass should be compared with those given by Levinus Lemnius in\r\n_The Secret Miracles of Nature_ (London, 1658); by Lipenius in _Navigatio\r\nSalomonis Ophiritica_ (Witteb., 1660, p. 333); and with that given in\r\nBarlowe's _Navigators Supply_ (London, 1597). See also Robert Dudley's\r\n_Dell' Arcano del Mare_ (Firenze, 1646).\r\n\r\n[226] PAGE 165 deals with the construction; the process of magnetizing by\r\nthe loadstone had already been discussed in pp. 147 to 149. It is\r\ninteresting to see that already the magnetized part attached below the\r\ncompass-card was being specialized in form, being made either of two pieces\r\nbent to meet at their ends, or of a single oval piece with elongated ends.\r\nThe marking of the compass-card is particularly described. It was divided\r\ninto thirty-two points or \"winds,\" precisely as the earlier \"wind-rose\" of\r\nthe geographers, distinguisht by certain marks, and by a lily--or\r\nfleur-de-lys--indicating the North. Stevin in the _Havenfinding Art_\r\n(London, 1599), from which work the passage on p. 167 is quoted, speaking\r\non p. 20 of \"the Instrument which we call the Sea-directorie, some the\r\nnautical box, ... or the sea compasse,\" mentions the \"Floure de luce\"\r\nmarking the North.\r\n\r\nThe legend which assigns the invention of the compass to one Goia or Gioja\r\nof Amalfi in 1302 has been already discussed in the Note to page 4. Gilbert\r\ngenerously says that in spite of the adverse evidence he does not wish to\r\ndeprive the Amalfians of the honour of the construction adopted in the\r\ncompasses used in the Mediterranean. But Baptista Porta the Neapolitan, who\r\nwrote forty years before Gilbert, discredited the legend. \"_Flavius_ saith,\r\nan Italian found it out first, whose name was _Amalphus_, born in our {57}\r\nCampania. But he knew not the Mariners Card, but stuck the needle in a\r\nreed, or a piece of wood, cross over; and he put the needles into a vessel\r\nfull of water that they might flote freely.\" (Porta's _Natural Magick_,\r\nEnglish translation, London, 1658, p. 206.) See also Lipenius (_op. citat._\r\np. 390).\r\n\r\nThe pivotting of the needle is expressly described in the famous _Epistle_\r\non the Magnet of Peter Peregrinus, which was written in 1269. Gasser's\r\nedition, _Epistola Petri Peregrini ... de magnete_, was printed in Augsburg\r\nin 1558. In Part II., cap. 2, of this letter, a form of instrument is\r\ndescribed for directing one's course to towns and islands, and any places\r\nin fact on land or sea. This instrument consists of a vessel like a turned\r\nbox (or _pyxis_) of wood, brass, or any solid material, not deep, but\r\nsufficiently wide, provided with a cover of glass or crystal. In its middle\r\nis arranged a slender axis of brass or silver, pivotted at its two ends\r\ninto the top and the bottom of the box. This axis is pierced orthogonally\r\nwith two holes, through one of which is passed the steel needle, while\r\nthrough the other is fixed square across the needle another stylus of\r\nsilver or brass. The glass cover was to be marked with two cross lines\r\nnorth-south and east-west; and each quadrant was to be divided into ninety\r\ndegrees. This the earliest described pivotted compass was therefore of the\r\ncross-needle type, a form claimed as a new invention by Barlowe in 1597.\r\nThe first suggestion of suspending a magnetic needle by a thread appears to\r\nbe in the _Speculum Lapidum_ of Camillus Leonardus (Venet., 1502, fig. k\r\nij, lines 25-31): \"Nã tacto ferro ex una [=p]te magnetis ex opposita eius\r\n[=p]te appropinquato fugat: ut ex[=p]i[~e]tia docet de acu appenso filo.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest known examples of the \"wind-rose\" are those in certain\r\nparchment charts preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice. These go\r\nback to 1426 or 1436, the best being ascribed to Andrea Bianco. They have\r\nthe North indicated by a fleur-de-lys, a trident, a simple triangle, or a\r\nletter T; while the East is distinguisht by a cross. The West is marked\r\nwith a P. (see Fincati, _op. citat._). The eight marks in order, clock\r\nwise, run thus,\r\n\r\n  [Lily] (or T).  G.   [Cross] (or L)   S.   O.   A (or L).   P.   M.\r\n\r\nThe letters correspond to the Italian names of the principal winds:\r\n\r\n  Tramontano                  North.\r\n  Greco                       North-East.\r\n  Levante                     East.\r\n  Sirocco                     South-East.\r\n  Ostro                       South.\r\n  Africo or Libeccio          South-West.\r\n  Ponente                     West.\r\n  Maestro                     North-West.\r\n\r\nWind-roses marked with the names of the minor winds are found in\r\nNautonier's _Mécometrie de l'Eyman_ (Vennes, 1602-1604, pp. 151-152), and\r\nKircher's _Magnes Siue de Arte Magnetica_ (Colon. Agripp., 1643, p. 432).\r\nThe description above given of the early Venetian wind-roses _exactly_\r\ndescribes the compass-card as depicted by Pedro de Medina in his _Arte de\r\nNauegar_ (Valladolid, 1545, folio lxxx.), in the sixth book entitled \"las\r\naguias de navegar\"; while in the _Breve compendio de la sphera_ of Martin\r\nCortes (Sevilla, 1551, cap. iii., _de la piedrayman_) a similar wind-rose,\r\nwithout the letters, is found.\r\n\r\n{58} In the _De Ventis et navigatione_ of Michaele Angelo Blondo (Venet.,\r\n1546, p. 15) is given a wind-rose, described as \"Pixis uel Buxolus\r\ninstrumentum et dux nauigantium,\" having twenty-six points inscribed with\r\nthe names of the winds, there being six between north and east, and six\r\nbetween south and west, and only five in each of the other quadrants. In\r\nthe middle is a smaller wind-rose exactly like the early Italian ones just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the _Della Guerra di Rhodi_ of Jacobo Fontano (Venet., 1545, pages\r\n71-74) is a chapter _Dei Venti, e della Bvssola di nauicare di Giovanni\r\nQuintino_, giving a wind-rose, and a table of the names of the winds, the\r\nnorth being indicated by a pointer, at the cusp of which are seven stars,\r\nand the west by an image of the sun. The other cardinal points are marked\r\nwith letters.\r\n\r\nBarlowe, in _The Navigators Supply_ (Lond., 1597), speaks thus:\r\n\r\n    \"The merueilous and diuine Instrument, called the _Sayling Compasse_\r\n    (being one of the greatest wonders that this World hath) is a Circle\r\n    diuided commonly into 32. partes, tearmed by our Seamen Windes,\r\n    _Rumbes_, or Points of Compasse.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a disputed point with whom the method of naming the winds originated.\r\nSome ascribe it to Charlemagne. Michiel Coignet (_Instruction novvelle ...\r\ntouchant l'art de naviguer_, Anvers, 1581, p. 7) ascribes it to Andronicus\r\nCyrrhestes. See Varro, _De Re Rustica_, iii., 5, 17, and Vitruvius, i., 6,\r\n4.\r\n\r\nGilbert's complaint of the evil practice of setting the needles obliquely\r\nbeneath the card, with the intention of allowing for the variation, is an\r\necho of a similar complaint in Norman's _Newe Attractiue_. In chapter x. of\r\nthis work Norman thus enumerates the different kinds of compasses:\r\n\r\n    \"Of these common Sayling Compasses, I find heere (in _Europa_) five\r\n    sundry sortes or sets. The first is of _Levant_, made in _Scicile_,\r\n    _Genoüa_, and _Venice_: And these are all (for the most parte) made\r\n    Meridionally, with the Wyers directlye sette under the South, and North\r\n    of the Compasse: And therefore, duely shewing the poynt _Respective_,\r\n    in all places, as the bare Needle. And by this Compasse are the Plats\r\n    made, for the most part of all the _Levants_ Seas.\r\n\r\n    \"Secondly, there are made in _Danske_, in the Sound of _Denmarke_, and\r\n    in _Flanders_, that have the Wyers set at 3 quarters of a point to the\r\n    Eastwards of the North of the compasse, and also some at a whole point:\r\n    and by these Compasses they make both the Plats and Rutters for the\r\n    Sound.\r\n\r\n    \"Thirdly, there hath beene made in this Countrey particulary, for Saint\r\n    _Nicholas_ and _Ruscia_, Compasses set at 3 seconds of a point, and the\r\n    first Plats of that Discoverie were made by this Compasse.\r\n\r\n    \"Fourthly the Compasse made at _Sevill_, _Lisbone_, _Rochell_,\r\n    _Bourdeaux_, _Roan_, and heere in _England_, are moste commonly set at\r\n    halfe a point: And by this Compasse are the Plats of the East and West\r\n    _Indies_ made for their Pylotes, and also for our Coastes neere hereby,\r\n    as _France_, _Spayne_, _Portugall_, and _England_: and therefore best\r\n    of these Nations to bee used, because it is the most common sorte that\r\n    is generally used in these Coastes.\"\r\n\r\nBessard (_op. citat._, pages 22 and 48) gives cuts of compasses showing the\r\nneedle displaced one rumbe to the East.\r\n\r\nGallucci, in his _Ratio fabricandi horaria mobilia et permanentia cum\r\nmagnetica acu_ (Venet., 1596), describes the needle as inclined 10 degrees\r\nfrom the south toward the south-west.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece of the work of Pedro Nuñez, _Instrumenta Artis Navigandi_,\r\nBasil., 1592, depicts a compass with the lily set one point to the east.\r\n\r\nReibelt, _De Physicis et Pragmaticis Magnetis Mysteriis_ (Herbipolis,\r\n1731), depicts the compass with the needle set about 12 degrees to the East\r\nof North. See also Fournier, _Hydrographie_ (Paris 1667); De Lanis,\r\n_Magisterium Natvræ et Artis_ (Brixiæ, 1684); Milliet Deschales, _Cursus\r\nseu Mundus {59} Mathematicus_ (Lugd., 1674). Both the latter works give\r\npictures of the compass-cards as used in South Europe, and in North Europe,\r\nand of the various known shapes of needles.\r\n\r\n[227] PAGE 168, LINE 29. Page 168, line 33. _Directio igitur inualidior est\r\npropè polos._ Here as in many passages _direction_ means _the force which\r\ndirects_. A similar usage prevails with the nouns _variation_ and\r\n_declination_, meaning frequently the force causing variation or\r\ndeclination respectively.\r\n\r\nPAGE 172, LINE 13. _perquirere._ The edition of 1633 reads _perquirero_, in\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n[228] PAGE 172, LINE 29.

If this were\r\naccurately so, then a traveller by merely measuring the dip would be able\r\nto ascertain, by calculation, by reference to tables, or by aid of some\r\ngeometrical appliance, {60} the latitude of the place. In this hope Gilbert\r\nfought to perfect the dipping-needle; and he also worked out, on pages 199\r\nand 200, an empirical theory, and a diagram. This theory was still further\r\ndeveloped by him, and given to Thomas Blundevile (see the Note to p. 240).\r\nBriggs of Gresham College, on Gilbert's suggestion, calculated a table of\r\nDip and Latitude on this theory. It was found, however, that the observed\r\nfacts deviated more or less widely from the theory. Kircher (_Magnes_,\r\n1643, p. 368) gives a comparative table of the computed and observed\r\nvalues. Further discovery showed the method to be impracticable, and\r\nGilbert's hope remained unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[237] PAGE 197, LINE 18.

This figure of the experiment with the simple dipping\r\nneedle suspended in water in a goblet is due to Robert Norman. In his _Newe\r\nAttractiue_ (London, 1581, chap. vi.) he thus describes it:\r\n\r\n    \"Then you shall take a deepe Glasse, Bowle, Cuppe, or other vessell,\r\n    and fill it with fayre water, setting it in some place where it may\r\n    rest quiet, and out of the winde. This done, cut the Corke\r\n    circumspectly, by little and little, untill the wyre with the Corke be\r\n    so fitted, that it may remain under the superficies of the water two or\r\n    three inches, both ends of the wyer lying levell with the superficies\r\n    of the water, without ascending or descending, like to the beame of a\r\n    payre of ballance beeing equalie poysed at both ends.\r\n\r\n    \"Then take out of the same the wyer without mooving the Corke, and\r\n    touch it with the _Stone_, the one end with the South of the _Stone_,\r\n    and the other end with the North, and then set it againe in the water,\r\n    and you shall see it presentlie turne it selfe upon his owne Center,\r\n    shewing the aforesay'd _Declining_ propertie, without descending to the\r\n    bottome, as by reason it should, if there were any _Attraction_\r\n    downewards, the lower part of the water being neerer that point, then\r\n    the superficies thereof.\"\r\n\r\n[240] PAGE 212, LINE 7.

The passage here quoted from\r\nDominicus Maria Ferrariensis, otherwise known as the astronomer Novara,\r\ndoes not occur in any known writing of that famous man. It is, however,\r\nquoted as being by Novara in at least three other writings of the same\r\nepoch. See the _Tabulæ secvndorum mobilium coelestium_ of Maginus (Venet.,\r\n1585, p. 29, line 19 to p. 30, line 11); the _Eratosthenes Batavvs_ of\r\nWillebrord Snell (Lugd. Batav., 1617, pp. 40-42); and the _Almagesti novi\r\n(Pars Posterior)_ of Riccioli (Bonon., 1651, p. 348). The original document\r\nappears to have perisht. See a notice by M.

The\r\nlatter {61} passage may be compared with Aristotle, _De Coelo_, II. 13,\r\nwho, referring to the followers of Pythagoras, says: \"They say that the\r\nmiddle is fire, that the earth is a star, and that it is moved circularly\r\nabout this centre; and that by this movement it produces day and night.\"\r\n\r\n[243] PAGE 214, LINE 34.

The Jesuit Fathers\r\nwho followed Gilbert, but rejected his Copernican ideas, pounced upon this\r\npseudo-experiment, as though by disproving it they had upset the Copernican\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n[249] PAGE 227, LINE 6.

Page 240, line 17. _à Copernico (Astronomiæ\r\ninstauratore)._--Gilbert was the first in England to uphold the doctrines\r\nof {62} Copernicus as to the motion of the earth on its axis and its\r\nrevolution around the sun. He considered that his magnetic observations\r\nbrought new support to that theory, and his views are quoted with\r\napprobation by Kepler, _Epitome Astronomiæ Copernicanæ_ ... Authore Ioanne\r\nKeplero ... (Francofurti, 1635); and by Galileo, _Dialogus de Systemate\r\nMundi_ (Augustæ Treboc., 1635), an English translation of which appeared in\r\nSalusbury's _Mathematical Collections and Translations_ (London, 1661, pp.\r\n364 to 377).\r\n\r\nFor this the book _De Magnete_ was considered by many as heretical. Many of\r\nthe copies existing in Italy are found to be either mutilated or else\r\nbranded with a cross. For example, the copy in the library of the Collegio\r\nRomano in Rome has book VI. torn out. Galileo states that the Book of\r\nGilbert would possibly never have come into his hands \"if a Peripatetick\r\nPhilosopher, of great fame, as I believe to free his Library from its\r\ncontagion, had not given it me.\" In England Barlowe, in his _Magneticall\r\nAduertisements_ (1616), expressly repudiated Gilbert's Copernican notions,\r\nwhile praising his discoveries in magnetism. Marke Ridley, while upholding\r\nGilbert's views, in his _Magneticall Animadversions_ (1617) did not\r\nconsider him \"skilfull in Copernicus.\" The Jesuit writers, Cabeus, Kircher,\r\nFonseca, Grandamicus, Schott, Leotaudus, Millietus, and De Lanis, one and\r\nall, who followed Gilbert in their magnetic writings, repudiated the idea\r\nthat the magnetism of the globe gave support to the heretical modern\r\nAstronomy.\r\n\r\nThe works referred to are:\r\n\r\nCabeus, _Philosophia Magnetica, in qua Magnetis natura penitus explicatur\r\n... auctore Nicolao Cabeo Ferrarensi Soc. Jesv._ (Ferrariæ, 1629).\r\n\r\nKircher, _Magnes, Siue de Arte Magnetica, Libri tres, Authore Athanasio\r\nKirchero ... e Soc. Iesv._ (Romæ, 1641).\r\n\r\nGrandamicus, _Nova Demonstratio immobilitatis terræ petita ex virtute\r\nmagnetica_ (Flexiæ, 1645). This work is most beautifully illustrated with\r\ncopper-plate etchings of cupids making experiments with terrellas.\r\n\r\nSchott, Gaspar, _Thaumaturgus Physicus_ (Herbipolis, 1659).\r\n\r\nLeotaudus, _R.

Page 240, line 31. _hic finem & periodum\r\nimponimus._\r\n\r\nOn February 13 [1601] Gilbert wrote to Barlowe (see _Magneticall\r\nAduertisements_, p. 88):\r\n\r\n\"I purpose to adioyne an appendix of six or eight sheets of paper to my\r\nbooke after a while, I am in hand with it of some new inventions, and I\r\nwould haue some of your experiments, in your name and inuention put into\r\nit, if you please, that you may be knowen for an augmenter of that arte.\"\r\n\r\nThis he never did. Perhaps his appointment (in February, 1601) as chief\r\nphysician in personal attendance on the Queen interfered with the project;\r\nor his death, of the plague, in 1603, intervened before his intention had\r\nbeen carried into effect. But it is probable that the substance of the\r\nproposed additions is to be found in the chapter, publisht in Gilbert's\r\nlifetime, in Blundevile's _Theoriques of the seuen Planets_ (London, 1602),\r\nthus described in the title-page of the work: \"There is also hereto added,\r\n{63} The making, description, and vse, of two most ingenious and necessarie\r\nInstruments for Sea-men, to find out thereby the latitude of any Place vpon\r\nthe Sea or Land, in the darkest night that is, without the helpe of Sunne,\r\nMoone, or Starre. First inuented by M. Doctor Gilbert, a most excellent\r\nPhilosopher, and one of the ordinarie Physicians to her Maiestie: and now\r\nhere plainely set downe in our mother tongue by Master Blundeuile.\"\r\n\r\nOf these two instruments the first consists of a mechanical device, with\r\nmovable quadrants, to be cut out in cardboard, to be used in connection\r\nwith the diagram of spiral lines which Gilbert had given as a folding plate\r\nbetween pages 200 and 201 of _De Magnete_. The intention was that the\r\nSea-man having found by experiment with a dipping-needle the amount of the\r\ndip at any place, should by applying this diagram and its moving quadrants,\r\nascertain the latitude, according to the theory expounded in book V., chap.\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe second instrument is a simplified portable dipping-needle, having the\r\ndegrees engraved on the inner face of a cylindrical brass ring.\r\n\r\nBlundevile adds a Table, calculated by Briggs, and \"annexed to the former\r\nTreatise by _Edward Wright_, at the motion of the right Worshipful M.\r\nDoctor _Gilbert_.\" This gives the values of the dip for different\r\nlatitudes, as calculated from Gilbert's empirical theory.\r\n\r\nThe other work, _De Mundo nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova_, which Gilbert\r\nleft in manuscript at his death, does not contain any additional matter on\r\nthe magnetical investigations. Though it contains several direct references\r\nto the _de Magnete_, and particularly to Book VI. on the rotation of the\r\nearth, it is doubtful whether it was written after or before the\r\npublication of _de Magnete_. On pages 137 to 144 of the posthumous edition\r\n(Amsterdam, 1651) Gilbert refers to Peregrinus's alleged perpetually\r\nrevolving sphere, and denies its possibility. The greater part of the work\r\nis an anti-Aristotelian discussion on Air, Meteorology, Astronomy, the\r\nWinds, Tides, and Springs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{65} INDEX TO AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n  Abano, Pietro di, 6.\r\n  Acosta, Josephus, 16.\r\n  Addison, Joseph, 35.\r\n  Aepinus, 44.\r\n  Aetius Amidenus, 6.\r\n  Affaytatus, 16, 39.\r\n  Agricola, Georgius, 25, 31, 36, 50.\r\n  Agrippa, H.
