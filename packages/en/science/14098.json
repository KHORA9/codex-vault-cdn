KIRGATE, MDCCLXXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the invaluable present I am making to the world may not please all\r\ntastes, from the gravity of the matter, the solidity of the reasoning,\r\nand the deep learning contained in the ensuing sheets, it is necessary\r\nto make some apology for producing this work in so trifling an age, when\r\nnothing will go down but temporary politics, personal satire, and idle\r\nromances. The true reason then for my surmounting all these objections\r\nwas singly this: I was apprehensive lest the work should be lost to\r\nposterity; and though it may be condemned at present, I can have no\r\ndoubt but it will be treated with due reverence some hundred ages hence,\r\nwhen wisdom and learning shall have gained their proper ascendant over\r\nmankind, and when men shall only read for instruction and improvement of\r\ntheir minds. As I shall print an hundred thousand copies, some, it may\r\nbe hoped, will escape the havoc that is made of moral works, and then\r\nthis jewel will shine forth in its genuine lustre. I was in the greater\r\nhurry to consign this work to the press, as I foresee that the art of\r\nprinting will ere long be totally lost, like other useful discoveries\r\nwell known to the ancients. Such were the art of dissolving rocks with\r\nhot vinegar, of teaching elephants to dance on the slack rope, of making\r\nmalleable glass, of writing epic poems that any body would read after\r\nthey had been published a month, and the stupendous invention of new\r\nreligions, a secret of which illiterate Mahomet was the last person\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this my zeal for good letters, and the ardour of my\r\nuniversal citizenship, (for I declare I design this present for all\r\nnations) there are some small difficulties in the way, that prevent my\r\nconferring this my great benefaction on the world compleatly and all at\r\nonce. I am obliged to produce it in small portions, and therefore beg\r\nthe prayers of all good and wise men that my life may be prolonged to\r\nme, till I shall be able to publish the whole work, no man else being\r\ncapable of executing the charge so well as myself, for reasons that my\r\nmodesty will not permit me to specify. In the mean time, as it is the\r\nduty of an editor to acquaint the world with what relates to himself as\r\nwell as his author, I think it right to mention the causes that compel\r\nme to publish this work in numbers. The common reason of such proceeding\r\nis to make a book dearer for the ease of the purchasers, it being\r\nsupposed that most people had rather give twenty shillings by sixpence a\r\nfortnight, than pay ten shillings once for all. Public spirited as this\r\nproceeding is, I must confess my reasons are more and merely personal.\r\nAs my circumstances are very moderate, and barely sufficient to maintain\r\ndecently a gentleman of my abilities and learning, I cannot afford to\r\nprint at once an hundred thousand copies of two volumes in folio, for\r\nthat will be the whole mass of Hieroglyphic Tales when the work is\r\nperfected. In the next place, being very asthmatic, and requiring a free\r\ncommunication of air, I lodge in the uppermost story of a house in an\r\nalley not far from St. Mary Axe; and as a great deal of good company\r\nlodges in the same mansion, it was by a considerable favour that I could\r\nobtain a single chamber to myself; which chamber is by no means large\r\nenough to contain the whole impression, for I design to vend the copies\r\nmyself, and, according to the practice of other great men, shall sign\r\nthe first sheet my self with my own hand.\r\n\r\nDesirous as I am of acquainting the world with many more circumstances\r\nrelative to myself, some private considerations prevent my indulging\r\ntheir curiosity any farther at present; but I shall take care to leave\r\nso minute an account of myself to some public library, that the future\r\ncommentators and editors of this work shall not be deprived of all\r\nnecessary lights. In the mean time I beg the reader to accept the\r\ntemporary compensation of an account of the author whose work I am\r\npublishing.\r\n\r\nThe Hieroglyphic Tales were undoubtedly written a little before the\r\ncreation of the world, and have ever since been preserved, by oral\r\ntradition, in the mountains of Crampcraggiri, an uninhabited island,\r\nnot yet discovered. Of these few facts we could have the most authentic\r\nattestations of several clergymen, who remember to have heard them\r\nrepeated by old men long before they, the said clergymen, were born.\r\nWe do not trouble the reader with these attestations, as we are sure\r\nevery body will believe them as much as if they had seen them. It is more\r\ndifficult to ascertain the true author. We might ascribe them with great\r\nprobability to Kemanrlegorpikos, son of Quat; but besides that we are\r\nnot certain that any such person ever existed, it is not clear that he\r\never wrote any thing but a book of cookery, and that in heroic verse.\r\nOthers give them to Quat's nurse, and a few to Hermes Trismegistus,\r\nthough there is a passage in the latter's treatise on the harpsichord\r\nwhich directly contradicts the account of the first volcano in the\r\n114th. of the Hieroglyphic Tales. As Trismegistus's work is lost, it\r\nis impossible to decide now whether the discordance mentioned is so\r\npositive as has been asserted by many learned men, who only guess at the\r\nopinion of Hermes from other passages in his writings, and who indeed\r\nare not sure whether he was speaking of volcanoes or cheesecakes, for\r\nhe drew so ill, that his hieroglyphics may often be taken for the most\r\nopposite things in nature; and as there is no subject which he has not\r\ntreated, it is not precisely known what he was discussing in any one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThis is the nearest we can come to any certainty with regard to the\r\nauthor. But whether he wrote the Tales six thousand years ago, as we\r\nbelieve, or whether they were written for him within these ten years,\r\nthey are incontestably the most ancient work in the world; and though\r\nthere is little imagination, and still less invention in them; yet there\r\nare so many passages in them exactly resembling Homer, that any man\r\nliving would conclude they were imitated from that great poet, if it was\r\nnot certain that Homer borrowed from them, which I shall prove two ways:\r\nfirst, by giving Homer's parallel passages at the bottom of the page;\r\nand secondly, by translating Homer himself into prose, which shall make\r\nhim so unlike himself, that nobody will think he could be an original\r\nwriter: and when he is become totally lifeless and insipid, it will be\r\nimpossible but these Tales should be preferred to the Iliad; especially\r\nas I design to put them into a kind of style that shall be neither verse\r\nnor prose; a diction lately much used in tragedies and heroic poems, the\r\nformer of which are really heroic poems from want of probability, as an\r\nantico-moderno epic poem is in fact a meer tragedy, having little or no\r\nchange of scene, no incidents but a ghost and a storm, and no events but\r\nthe deaths of the principal actors.\r\n\r\nI will not detain the reader longer from the perusal of this invaluable\r\nwork; but I must beseech the public to be expeditious in taking off the\r\nwhole impression, as fast as I can get it printed; because I must inform\r\nthem that I have a more precious work in contemplation; namely, a new\r\nRoman history, in which I mean to ridicule, detect and expose, all\r\nancient virtue, and patriotism, and shew from original papers which\r\nI am going to write, and which I shall afterwards bury in the ruins of\r\nCarthage and then dig up, that it appears by the letters of Hanno the\r\nPunic embassador at Rome, that Scipio was in the pay of Hannibal, and\r\nthat the dilatoriness of Fabius proceeded from his being a pensioner\r\nof the Same general. I own this discovery will pierce my heart; but as\r\nmorality is best taught by shewing how little effect it had on the best\r\nof men, I will sacrifice the most virtuous names for the instruction of\r\nthe present wicked generation; and I cannot doubt but when once they\r\nhave learnt to detest the favourite heroes of antiquity, they will\r\nbecome good subjects of the most pious king that ever lived since David,\r\nwho expelled the established royal family, and then sung psalms to the\r\nmemory of Jonathan, to whose prejudice he had succeeded to the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALE 1.\r\n\r\n_A new Arabian Night's Entertainment._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the great mountain Hirgonqúu was anciently situated the\r\nkingdom of Larbidel. Geographers, who are not apt to make such just\r\ncomparisons, said, it resembled a football just going to be kicked away;\r\nand so it happened; for the mountain kicked the kingdom into the ocean,\r\nand it has never been heard of since.\r\n\r\nOne day a young princess had climbed up to the top of the mountain to\r\ngather goat's eggs, the whites of which are excellent for taking off\r\nfreckles.--Goat's eggs!--Yes--naturalists hold that all Beings are\r\nconceived in an egg. The goats of Hirgonqúu might be oviparous, and lay\r\ntheir eggs to be hatched by the sun. This is my supposition; no matter\r\nwhether I believe it myself or not. I will write against and abuse any\r\nman that opposes my hypothesis. It would be fine indeed if learned men\r\nwere obliged to believe what they assert.\r\n\r\nThe other side of the mountain was inhabited by a nation of whom the\r\nLarbidellians knew no more than the French nobility do of Great Britain,\r\nwhich they think is an island that some how or other may be approached\r\nby land. The princess had strayed into the confines of Cucurucu, when\r\nshe suddenly found herself seized by the guards of the prince that\r\nreigned in that country. They told her in few words that she must be\r\nconveyed to the capital and married to the giant their lord and emperor.\r\nThe giant, it seems, was fond of having a new wife every night, who was\r\nto tell him a story that would last till morning, and then have her head\r\ncut off--such odd ways have some folks of passing their wedding-nights!\r\nThe princess modestly asked, why their master loved such long stories?\r\nThe captain of the guard replied, his majesty did not sleep well--Well!\r\nsaid she, and if he does not!--not but I believe I can tell as long\r\nstories as any princess in Asia. Nay, I can repeat Leonidas by heart,\r\nand your emperor must be wakeful indeed if he can hold out against that.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were arrived at the palace. To the great surprise of\r\nthe princess, the emperor, so far from being a giant, was but five feet\r\none inch in height; but being two inches taller than any of his\r\npredecessors, the flattery of his courtiers had bestowed the name of\r\n_giant_ on him; and he affected to look down upon any man above his own\r\nstature. The princess was immediately undressed and put to bed, his\r\nmajesty being impatient to hear a new story.\r\n\r\nLight of my eyes, said the emperor, what is your name? I call myself the\r\nprincess Gronovia, replied she; but my real appellation is the frow\r\nGronow. And what is the use of a name, said his majesty, but to be\r\ncalled by it? And why do you pretend to be a princess, if you are not?\r\nMy turn is romantic, answered she, and I have ever had an ambition of\r\nbeing the heroine of a novel. Now there are but two conditions that\r\nentitle one to that rank; one must be a shepherdess or a princess. Well,\r\ncontent yourself, said the giant, you will die an empress, without\r\nbeing either the one or the other! But what sublime reason had you for\r\nlengthening your name so unaccountably? It is a custom in my family,\r\nsaid she: all my ancestors were learned men, who wrote about the Romans.\r\nIt sounded more classic, and gave a higher opinion of their literature,\r\nto put a Latin termination to their names. All this is Japonese to me,\r\nsaid the emperor; but your ancestors seem to have been a parcel of\r\nmountebanks. Does one understand any thing the better for corrupting\r\none's name? Oh, said the princess, but it shewed taste too. There was\r\na time when in Italy the learned carried this still farther; and a man\r\nwith a large forehead, who was born on the fifth of January, called\r\nhimself Quintus Januarius Fronto. More and more absurd, said the\r\nemperor. You seem to have a great deal of impertinent knowledge about a\r\ngreat many impertinent people; but proceed in your story: whence came\r\nyou? Mynheer, said she, I was born in Holland--The deuce you was, said\r\nthe emperor, and where is that? It was no where, replied the princess,\r\nspritelily, till my countrymen gained it from the sea--Indeed, moppet!\r\nsaid his majesty; and pray who were your countrymen, before you had any\r\ncountry? Your majesty asks a vey shrewd question, said she, which I\r\ncannot resolve on a sudden; but I will step home to my library, and\r\nconsult five or six thousand volumes of modern history, an hundred or\r\ntwo dictionaries, and an abridgment of geography in forty volumes in\r\nfolio, and be back in an instant. Not so fast, my life, said the\r\nemperor, you must not rise till you go to execution; it is now one in\r\nthe morning, and you have not begun your story.\r\n\r\nMy great grandfather, continued the princess, was a Dutch merchant, who\r\npassed many years in Japan--On what account? said the emperor. He went\r\nthither to abjure his religion, said she, that he might get money enough\r\nto return and defend it against Philip 2d. You are a pleasant family,\r\nsaid the emperor; but though I love fables, I hate genealogies. I know\r\nin all families, by their own account, there never was any thing but\r\ngood and great men from father to son; a sort of fiction that does not\r\nat all amuse me. In my dominions there is no nobility but flattery.\r\nWhoever flatters me best is created a great lord, and the titles I\r\nconfer are synonimous to their merits. There is Kiss-my-breech-Can, my\r\nfavourite; Adulation-Can, lord treasurer; Prerogative-Can, head of the\r\nlaw; and Blasphemy-Can, high-priest. Whoever speaks truth, corrupts his\r\nblood, and is ipso facto degraded. In Europe you allow a man to be noble\r\nbecause one of his ancestors was a flatterer. But every thing\r\ndegenerates, the farther it is removed from its source. I will not hear\r\na word of any of your race before your father: what was he?\r\n\r\nIt was in the height of the contests about the bull unigenitus--I tell\r\nyou, interrupted the emperor, I will not be plagued with any more of\r\nthose people with Latin names: they were a parcel of coxcombs, and seem\r\nto have infected you with their folly. I am sorry, replied Gronovia,\r\nthat your sublime highness is so little acquainted with the state of\r\nEurope, as to take a papal ordinance for a person. Unigenitus is Latin\r\nfor the Jesuits--And who the devil are the Jesuits? said the giant.\r\nYou explain one nonsensical term by another, and wonder I am never the\r\nwiser. Sir, said the princess, if you will permit me to give you a short\r\naccount of the troubles that have agitated Europe for these last two\r\nhundred years, on the doctrines of grace, free-will, predestination,\r\nreprobation, justification, &c. you will be more entertained, and will\r\nbelieve less, than if I told your majesty a long story of fairies and\r\ngoblins. You are an eternal prater, said the emperor, and very\r\nself-sufficient; but talk your fill, and upon what subject you like till\r\ntomorrow morning; but I swear by the soul of the holy Jirigi, who rode\r\nto heaven on the tail of a magpie, as soon as the clock strikes eight,\r\nyou are a dead woman. Well, who was the Jesuit Unigenitus?\r\n\r\nThe novel doctrines that had sprung up in Germany, said Gronovia, made\r\nit necessary for the church to look about her. The disciples of\r\nLoyola--Of whom? said the emperor, yawning--Ignatius Loyola, the founder\r\nof the Jesuits, replied Gronovia, was--A writer of Roman history, I\r\nsuppose, interrupted the emperor: what the devil were the Romans to you,\r\nthat you trouble your head so much about them? The empire of Rome, and\r\nthe church of Rome, are two distinct things, said the princess; and yet,\r\nas one may say, the one depends upon the other, as the new testament\r\ndoes on the old. One destroyed the other, and yet pretends a right to\r\nits inheritance. The temporalities of the church--What's o'clock, said\r\nthe emperor to the chief eunuch? it cannot sure be far from eight--this\r\nwoman has gossipped at least seven hours. Do you hear, my\r\ntomorrow-night's wife shall be dumb--cut her tongue out before you bring\r\nher to our bed. Madam, said the eunuch, his sublime highness, whose\r\nerudition passes the lands of the sea, is too well acquainted with all\r\nhuman sciences to require information. It is therefore that his exalted\r\nwisdom prefers accounts of what never happened, to any relation either\r\nin history or divinity--You lie, said the emperor; when I exclude truth,\r\nI certainly do not mean to forbid divinity--How many divinities have\r\nyou in Europe, woman? The council of Trent, replied Gronovia, has\r\ndecided--the emperor began to snore--I mean, continued Gronovia, that\r\nnotwithstanding all father Paul has asserted, cardinal Palavicini\r\naffirms that in the three first sessions of that council--the emperor\r\nwas now fast asleep, which the princess and the chief eunuch perceiving,\r\nclapped several pillows upon his face, and held them there till he\r\nexpired. As soon as they were convinced he was dead, the princess,\r\nputting on every mark of despair and concern, issued to the divan,\r\nwhere she was immediately proclaimed empress. The emperor, it was given\r\nout, had died of an hermorrhoidal cholic, but to shew her regard for his\r\nmemory, her imperial majesty declared she would strictly adhere to the\r\nmaxims by which he had governed. Accordingly she espoused a new husband\r\nevery night, but dispensed with their telling her stories, and was\r\ngraciously pleased also, upon their good behaviour, to remit the\r\nsubsequent execution. She sent presents to all the learned men in Asia;\r\nand they in return did not fail to cry her up as a pattern of clemency,\r\nwisdom, and virtue: and though the panegyrics of the learned are\r\ngenerally as clumsy as they are fulsome, they ventured to allure her\r\nthat their writings would be as durable as brass, and that the memory of\r\nher glorious reign would reach to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALE II.\r\n\r\n_The King and his three Daughters_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a king, who had three daughters--that is, he would\r\nhave had three, if he had had one more, but some how or other the eldest\r\nnever was born. She was extremely handsome, had a great deal of wit, and\r\nspoke French in perfection, as all the authors of that age affirm, and\r\nyet none of them pretend that she ever existed. It is very certain that\r\nthe two other princesses were far from beauties; the second had a strong\r\nYorkshire dialect, and the youngest had bad teeth and but one leg, which\r\noccasioned her dancing very ill.\r\n\r\nAs it was not probable that his majesty would have any more children,\r\nbeing eighty-seven years, two months, and thirteen days old when his\r\nqueen died, the states of the kingdom were very anxious to have the\r\nprincesses married. But there was one great obstacle to this settlement,\r\nthough so important to the peace of the kingdom. The king insisted that\r\nhis eldest daughter should be married first, and as there was no such\r\nperson, it was very difficult to fix upon a proper husband for her. The\r\ncourtiers all approved his majesty's resolution; but as under the best\r\nprinces there will always be a number of discontented, the nation was\r\ntorn into different factions, the grumblers or patriots insisting that\r\nthe second princess was the eldest, and ought to be declared heiress\r\napparent to the crown. Many pamphlets were written pro and con, but\r\nthe ministerial party pretended that the chancellor's argument was\r\nunanswerable, who affirmed, that the second princess could not be the\r\neldest, as no princess-royal ever had a Yorkshire accent. A few persons\r\nwho were attached to the youngest princess, took advantage of this plea\r\nfor whispering that _her_ royal highness's pretensions to the crown were\r\nthe best of all; for as there was no eldest princess, and as the second\r\nmust be the first, if there was no first, and as she could not be the\r\nsecond if she was the first, and as the chancellor had proved that she\r\ncould not be the first, it followed plainly by every idea of law that\r\nshe could be nobody at all; and then the consequence followed of course,\r\nthat the youngest must be the eldest, if she had no elder sister.\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable what animosities and mischiefs arose from these\r\ndifferent titles; and each faction endeavoured to strengthen itself\r\nby foreign alliances. The court party having no real object for their\r\nattachment, were the most attached of all, and made up by warmth for\r\nthe want of foundation in their principles. The clergy in general were\r\ndevoted to this, which was styled _the first party_. The physicians\r\nembraced the second; and the lawyers declared for the third, or the\r\nfaction of the youngest princess, because it seemed best calculated to\r\nadmit of doubts and endless litigation.\r\n\r\nWhile the nation was in this distracted situation, there arrived the\r\nprince of Quifferiquimini, who would have been the most accomplished\r\nhero of the age, if he had not been dead, and had spoken any language\r\nbut the Egyptian, and had not had three legs. Notwithstanding these\r\nblemishes, the eyes of the whole nation were immediately turned upon\r\nhim, and each party wished to see him married to the princess whose\r\ncause they espoused.\r\n\r\nThe old king received him with the most distinguished honours; the\r\nsenate made the most fulsome addresses to him; the princesses were so\r\ntaken with him, that they grew more bitter enemies than ever; and the\r\ncourt ladies and petit-maitres invented a thousand new fashions upon his\r\naccount--every thing was to be à la Quifferiquimini. Both men and women\r\nof fashion left off rouge to look the more cadaverous; their cloaths\r\nwere embroidered with hieroglyphics, and all the ugly characters they\r\ncould gather from Egyptian antiquities, with which they were forced to\r\nbe contented, it being impossible to learn a language that is lost; and\r\nall tables, chairs, stools, cabinets and couches, were made with only\r\nthree legs; the last, howver, soon went out of fashion, as being very\r\ninconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe prince, who, ever since his death, had had but a weakly\r\nconstitution, was a little fatigued with this excess of attentions,\r\nand would often wish himself at home in his coffin. But his greatest\r\ndifficulty of all was to get rid of the youngest princess, who kept\r\nhopping after him wherever he went, and was so full of admiration\r\nof his three legs, and so modest about having but one herself, and so\r\ninquisitive to know how his three legs were set on, that being the best\r\nnatured man in the world, it went to his heart whenever in a fit of\r\npeevishness he happened to drop an impatient word, which never failed to\r\nthrow her into an agony of tears, and then she looked so ugly that it\r\nwas impossible for him to be tolerably civil to her. He was not much\r\nmore inclined to the second princess--In truth, it was the eldest who\r\nmade the conquest of his affections: and so violently did his passion\r\nencrease one Tuesday morning, that breaking through all prudential\r\nconsiderations (for there were many reasons which ought to have\r\ndetermined his choice in favour of either of the other sisters) he\r\nhurried to the old king, acquainted him with his love, and demanded the\r\neldest princess in marriage. Nothing could equal the joy of the good old\r\nmonarch, who wished for nothing but to live to see the consummation of\r\nthis match. Throwing his arms about the prince-skeleton's neck and\r\nwatering his hollow cheeks with warm tears, he granted his request, and\r\nadded, that he would immediately resign his crown to him and his\r\nfavourite daughter.\r\n\r\nI am forced for want of room to pass over many circumstances that would\r\nadd greatly to the beauty of this history, and am sorry I must dash the\r\nreader's impatience by acquainting him, that notwithstanding the\r\neagerness of the old king and youthful ardour of the prince, the\r\nnuptials were obliged to be postponed; the archbishop declaring that it\r\nwas essentially necessary to have a dispensation from the pope, the\r\nparties being related within the forbidden degrees; a woman that never\r\nwas, and a man that had been, being deemed first cousins in the eye of\r\nthe canon law.\r\n\r\nHence arose a new difficulty. The religion of the Quifferiquiminians was\r\ntotally opposite to that of the papists. The former believed in nothing\r\nbut grace; and they had a high-priest of their own, who pretended that\r\nhe was master of the whole fee-simple of grace, and by that possession\r\ncould cause every thing to have been that never had been, and could\r\nprevent every thing that had been from ever having been. \"We have\r\nnothing to do, said the prince to the king, but to send a solemn embassy\r\nto the high-priest of grace, with a present of a hundred thousand\r\nmillion of ingots, and he will cause your charming no-daughter to have\r\nbeen, and will prevent my having died, and then there will be no\r\noccasion for a dispensation from your old fool at Rome.\"--How! thou\r\nimpious, atheistical bag of drybones, cried the old king; dost thou\r\nprofane our holy religion? Thou shalt have no daughter of mine, thou\r\nthree-legged skeleton--Go and be buried and be damned, as thou must be;\r\nfor as thou art dead, thou art past repentance: I would sooner give my\r\nchild to a baboon, who has one leg more than thou hast, than bestow her\r\non such a reprobate corpse--You had better give your one-legged infanta\r\nto the baboon, said the prince, they are fitter for one another--As much\r\na corpse as I am, I am preferable to nobody; and who the devil would\r\nhave married your no-daughter, but a dead body! For my religion, I lived\r\nand died in it, and it is not in my power to change it now if I\r\nwould--but for your part--a great shout interrupted this dialogue, and\r\nthe captain of the guard rushing into the royal closet, acquainted his\r\nmajesty, that the second princess, in revenge of the prince's neglect,\r\nhad given her hand to a drysalter, who was a common-council-man, and\r\nthat the city, in consideration of the match, had proclaimed them king\r\nand queen, allowing his majesty to retain the title for his life, which\r\nthey had fixed for the term of six months; and ordering, in respect of\r\nhis royal birth, that the prince should immediately lie in state and\r\nhave a pompous funeral.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was so sudden and so universal, that all parties\r\napproved, or were forced to seem to approve it. The old king died the\r\nnext day, as the courtiers said, for joy; the prince of Quifferiquimini\r\nwas buried in spite of his appeal to the law of nations; and the\r\nyoungest princess went distracted, and was shut up in a madhouse,\r\ncalling out day and night for a husband with three legs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALE III.\r\n\r\n_The Dice-Box. A Fairy Tale._\r\n\r\n_Translated from the French Translation of the Countess DAUNOIS, for the\r\nEntertainment of Miss CAROLINE CAMPBELL._ [_Eldest daughter of lord\r\nWilliam Campbell; she lived with her aunt the countess of Ailesbury._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a merchant of Damascus named Aboulcasem, who had an only\r\ndaughter called Pissimissi, which signifies _the waters of Jordan_;\r\nbecause a fairy foretold at her birth that she would be one of Solomon's\r\nconcubines. Azaziel, the angel of death, having transported Aboulcasem\r\nto the regions of bliss, he had no fortune to bequeath to his beloved\r\nchild but the shell of a pistachia-nut drawn by an elephant and a\r\nladybird. Pissimissi, who was but nine years old, and who had been been\r\nkept in great confinement, was impatient to see the world; and no sooner\r\nwas the breath out of her father's body, than she got into the car, and\r\nwhipping her elephant and ladybird, drove out of the yard as fast as\r\npossible, without knowing whither she was going. Her coursers never\r\nstopped till they came to the foot of a brazen tower, that had neither\r\ndoors nor windows, in which lived an old enchantress, who had locked\r\nherself up there with seventeen thousand husbands. It had but one single\r\nvent for air, which was a small chimney grated over, through which it\r\nwas scarce possible to put one's hand. Pissimissi, who was very\r\nimpatient, ordered her coursers to fly with her up to the top of the\r\nchimney, which, as they were the most docile creatures in the world,\r\nthey immediately did; but unluckily the fore paw of the elephant\r\nlighting on the top of the chimney, broke down the grate by its weight,\r\nbut at the same time stopped up the passage so entirely, that all the\r\nenchantress's husbands were stifled for want of air. As it was a\r\ncollection she had made with great care and cost, it is easy to imagine\r\nher vexation and rage. She raised a storm of thunder and lightning that\r\nlasted eight hundred and four years; and having conjured up an army of\r\ntwo thousand devils, she ordered them to flay the elephant alive, and\r\ndress it for her supper with anchovy sauce. Nothing could have saved the\r\npoor beast, if, struggling to get loose from the chimney, he had not\r\nhappily broken wind, which it seems is a great preservative against\r\ndevils. They all flew a thousand ways, and in their hurry carried away\r\nhalf the brazen tower, by which means the elephant, the car, the\r\nladybird, and Pissimissi got loose; but in their fall tumbled through\r\nthe roof of an apothecary's shop, and broke all his bottles of physic.\r\nThe elephant, who was very dry with his fatigue, and who had not much\r\ntaste, immediately sucked up all the medicines with his proboscis, which\r\noccasioned such a variety of effects in his bowels, that it was well\r\nhe had such a strong constitution, or he must have died of it. His\r\nevacuations were so plentiful, that he not only drowned the tower of\r\nBabel, near which the apothecary's shop stood, but the current ran\r\nfourscore leagues till it came to the sea, and there poisoned so many\r\nwhales and leviathans, that a pestilence ensued, and lasted three years,\r\nnine months and sixteen days. As the elephant was extremely weakened by\r\nwhat had happened, it was impossible for him to draw the car for\r\neighteen months, which was a cruel delay to Pissimissi's impatience,\r\nwho during all that time could not travel above a hundred miles a day,\r\nfor as she carried the sick animal in her lap, the poor ladybird could\r\nnot make longer stages with no assistance. Besides, Pissimissi bought\r\nevery thing she saw wherever she came; and all was crouded into the car\r\nand stuffed into the seat. She had purchased ninety-two dolls, seventeen\r\nbaby-houses, six cart-loads of sugar-plumbs, a thousand ells of\r\ngingerbread, eight dancing dogs, a bear and a monkey, four toy-shops\r\nwith all their contents, and seven dozen of bibs and aprons of the\r\nnewest fashion. They were jogging on with all this cargo over mount\r\nCaucasus, when an immense humming-bird, who had been struck with the\r\nbeauty of the ladybird's wings, that I had forgot to say were of ruby\r\nspotted with black pearls, sousing down at once upon her prey, swallowed\r\nladybird, Pissimissi, the elephant, and all their commodities. It\r\nhappened that the humming-bird belonged to Solomon; he let it out of its\r\ncage every morning after breakfast, and it constantly came home by the\r\ntime the council broke up. Nothing could equal the surprise of his\r\nmajesty and the courtiers, when the dear little creature arrived with\r\nthe elephant's proboscis hanging out of its divine little bill.\r\nHowever, after the first astonishment was over, his majesty, who to be\r\nsure was wisdom itself, and who understood natural philosophy that it\r\nwas a charm to hear him discourse of those matters, and who was actually\r\nmaking a collection of dried beasts and birds in twelve thousand volumes\r\nof the best fool's-cap paper, immediately perceived what had happened,\r\nand taking out of the side-pocket of his breeches a diamond\r\ntoothpick-case of his own turning, with the toothpick made of the only\r\nunicorn's horn he ever saw, he stuck it into the elephant's snout, and\r\nbegan to draw it out: but all his philosophy was confounded, when jammed\r\nbetween the elephant's legs he perceived the head of a beautiful girl,\r\nand between her legs a baby-house, which with the wings extended thirty\r\nfeet, out of the windows of which rained a torrent of sugar-plumbs, that\r\nhad been placed there to make room. Then followed the bear, who had been\r\npressed to the bales of gingerbread and was covered all over with it,\r\nand looked but uncouthly; and the monkey with a doll in every paw, and\r\nhis pouches so crammed with sugar-plumbs that they hung on each side of\r\nhim, and trailed on the ground behind like the duchess of ----'s\r\nbeautiful breasts. Solomon, however, gave small attention to this\r\nprocession, being caught with the charms of the lovely Pissimissi: he\r\nimmediately began the song of songs extempore; and what he had seen--I\r\nmean, all that came out of the humming-bird's throat had made such a\r\njumble in his ideas, that there was nothing so unlike to which he did\r\nnot compare all Pissimissi's beauties. As he sung his canticles too\r\nto no tune, and god knows had but a bad voice, they were far from\r\ncomforting Pissimissi: the elephant had torn her best bib and apron, and\r\nshe cried and roared, and kept such a squalling, that though Solomon\r\ncarried her in his arms, and showed her all the fine things in the\r\ntemple, there was no pacifying her. The queen of Sheba, who was playing\r\nat backgammon with the high-priest, and who came every October to\r\nconverse with Solomon, though she did not understand a word of Hebrew,\r\nhearing the noise, came running out of her dressing-room; and seeing the\r\nking with a squalling child in his arms, asked him peevishly, if it\r\nbecame his reputed wisdom to expose himself with his bastards to all the\r\ncourt? Solomon, instead of replying, kept singing, \"We have a little\r\nsister, and she has no breasts;\" which so provoked the Sheban princess,\r\nthat happening to have one of the dice-boxes in her hand, she without\r\nany ceremony threw it at his head. The enchantress, whom I mentioned\r\nbefore, and who, though invisible, had followed Pissimissi, and drawn\r\nher into her train of misfortunes, turned the dice-box aside, and\r\ndirected it to Pissimissi's nose, which being something flat, like\r\nmadame de ----'s, it stuck there, and being of ivory, Solomon ever after\r\ncompared his beloved's nose to the tower that leads to Damascus. The\r\nqueen, though ashamed of her behaviour, was not in her heart sorry for\r\nthe accident; but when she found that it only encreased the monarch's\r\npassion, her contempt redoubled; and calling him a thousand old fools to\r\nherself, she ordered her post-chaise and drove away in a fury, without\r\nleaving sixpence for the servants; and nobody knows what became of her\r\nor her kingdom, which has never been heard of since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTALE IV.\r\n\r\n_The Peach in Brandy. A Milesian Tale._\r\n\r\n\r\nFitz Scanlan Mac Giolla l'ha druig,[1] king of Kilkenny, the thousand\r\nand fifty-seventh descendant in a direct line from Milesius king of\r\nSpain, had an only daughter called Great A, and by corruption Grata; who\r\nbeing arrived at years of discretion, and perfectly initiated by her\r\nroyal parents in the arts of government, the fond monarch determined to\r\nresign his crown to her: having accordingly assembled the senate, he\r\ndeclared his resolution to them, and having delivered his sceptre into\r\nthe princess's hand, he obliged her to ascend the throne; and to set the\r\nexample, was the first to kiss her hand, and vow eternal obedience to\r\nher. The senators were ready to stifle the new queen with panegyrics and\r\naddresses; the people, though they adored the old king, were transported\r\nwith having a new sovereign, and the university, according to custom\r\nimmemorial, presented her majesty, three months after every body had\r\nforgotten the event, with testimonials of the excessive sorrow and\r\nexcessive joy they felt on losing one monarch and getting another.\r\n\r\nHer majesty was now in the fifth year of her age, and a prodigy of sense\r\nand goodness. In her first speech to the senate, which she lisped with\r\ninimitable grace, she assured them that her [2] heart was entirely\r\nIrish, and that she did not intend any longer to go in leading-strings,\r\nas a proof of which she immediately declared her nurse prime-minister.\r\nThe senate applauded this sage choice with even greater encomiums\r\nthan the last, and voted a free gift to the queen of a million of\r\nsugar-plumbs, and to the favourite of twenty thousand bottles of\r\nusquebaugh. Her majesty then jumping from her throne, declared it was\r\nher royal pleasure to play at blindman's-buff, but such a hub-bub arose\r\nfrom the senators pushing, and pressing, and squeezing, and punching one\r\nanother, to endeavour to be the first blinded, that in the scuffle her\r\nmajesty was thrown down and got a bump on her forehead as big as a\r\npigeon's egg, which set her a squalling, that you might have heard her\r\nto Tipperary. The old king flew into a rage, and snatching up the mace\r\nknocked out the chancellor's brains, who at that time happened not to\r\nhave any; and the queen-mother, who sat in a tribune above to see the\r\nceremony, fell into a fit and [3] miscarried of twins, who were killed\r\nby her majesty's fright; but the earl of Bullaboo, great butler of the\r\ncrown, happening to stand next to the queen, catched up one of the dead\r\nchildren, and perceiving it was a boy, ran down to the [4] king and\r\nwished him joy of the birth of a son and heir. The king, who had now\r\nrecovered his sweet temper, called him a fool and blunderer, upon which\r\nMr. Phelim O'Torture, a zealous courtier, started up with great presence\r\nof mind and accused the earl of Bullaboo of high treason, for having\r\nasserted that his late majesty had had any other heir than their present\r\nmost lawful and most religious sovereign queen Grata. An impeachment\r\nwas voted by a large majority, though not without warm opposition,\r\nparticularly from a celebrated Kilkennian orator, whose name is\r\nunfortunately not come down to us, it being erased out of the journals\r\nafterwards, as the Irish author whom I copy says, when he became first\r\nlord of the treasury, as he was during the whole reign of queen Grata's\r\nsuccessor. The argument of this Mr. Killmorackill, says my author, whose\r\nname is lost, was, that her majesty the queen-mother having conceived a\r\nson before the king's resignation, that son was indubitably heir to the\r\ncrown, and consequently the resignation void, it not signifying an iota\r\nwhether the child was born alive or dead: it was alive, said he, when\r\nit was conceived--here he was called to order by Dr. O'Flaharty, the\r\nqueen-mother's man-midwife and member for the borough of Corbelly, who\r\nentered into a learned dissertation on embrios; but he was interrupted\r\nby the young queen's crying for her supper, the previous question for\r\nwhich was carried without a negative; and then the house being resumed,\r\nthe debate was cut short by the impatience of the majority to go and\r\ndrink her majesty's health. This seeming violence gave occasion to a\r\nvery long protest, drawn up by sir Archee Mac Sarcasm, in which he\r\ncontrived to state the claim of the departed foetus so artfully, that\r\nit produced a civil war, and gave rise to those bloody ravages and\r\nmassacres which so long laid waste the ancient kingdom of Kilkenny, and\r\nwhich were at last terminated by a lucky accident, well known, says my\r\nauthor, to every body, but which he thinks it his duty to relate for the\r\nsake of those who never may have heard it. These are his words:\r\n\r\n     It happened that the archbishop of Tuum (anciently called Meum by\r\n     the Roman catholic clergy) the great wit of those times, was in the\r\n     queen-mother's closet, who had the young queen in her lap. [5] His\r\n     grace was suddenly seized with a violent fit of the cholic, which\r\n     made him make such wry faces, that the queen-mother thought he was\r\n     going to die, and ran out of the room to send for a physician, for\r\n     she was a pattern of goodness, and void of pride. While she was\r\n     stepped into the servant's hall to call somebody, according to the\r\n     simplicity of those times, the archbishop's pains encreased, when\r\n     perceiving something on the mantle-piece, which he took for a peach\r\n     in brandy, he gulped it all down at once without saying grace, God\r\n     forgive him, and found great comfort from it. He had not done\r\n     licking his lips before the queen-mother returned, when queen Grata\r\n     cried out, \"Mama, mama, the gentleman has eat my little brother!\"\r\n     This fortunate event put an end to the contest, the male line\r\n     entirely failing in the person of the devoured prince. The\r\n     archbishop, however, who became pope by the name of Innocent the\r\n     3d. having afterwards a son by his sister, named the child\r\n     Fitzpatrick, as having some of the royal blood in its veins; and\r\n     from him are descended all the younger branches of the Fitzpatricks\r\n     of our time. Now the rest of the acts of Grata and all that she\r\n     did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the\r\n     kings of Kilkenny?\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON TALE IV.\r\n\r\n_This tale was written for Anne Liddel countess of Offory, wife of John\r\nFitzpatrick earl of Offory. They had a daughter Anne, the subject of\r\nthis story._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Vide Lodge's Peerage of Ireland, in the family of\r\nFitzpatrick._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Queen Anne in her first speech to the parliament said, her\r\nheart was entirely English._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Lady Offory had miscarried just then of two sons._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _The housekeeper, as soon as lord Offory came home, wished\r\nhim joy of a son and heir, though both the children were born dead._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Some commentators have ignorantly supposed that the Irish\r\nauthor is guilty of a great anachronism in this passage; for having said\r\nthat the contested succession occasioned long wars, he yet speaks of\r\nqueen Grata at the conclusion of them, as still sitting in her mother's\r\nlap as a child. Now I can confute them from their own state of the\r\nquestion_.

From that unerring\r\noracle she assured him, that he would be the most unhappy man alive\r\nunless he married a princess whose name was the same with her father's\r\ndominions. As in all probability there could not be above one person in\r\nthe world to whom that accident had happened, the prince thought there\r\nwould be nothing so easy as to learn who his destined bride was. He had\r\nbeen too well educated to put the question to his godmother, for he knew\r\nwhen she uttered an oracle, that it was with intention to perplex, not\r\nto inform; which has made people so fond of consulting all those who do\r\nnot give an explicit answer, such as prophets, lawyers, and any body you\r\nmeet on the road, who, if you ask the way, reply by desiring to know\r\nwhence you came. Mi Li was no sooner returned to his palace than he sent\r\nfor his governor, who was deaf and dumb, qualities for which the fairy\r\nhad selected him, that he might not instil any bad principles into his\r\npupil; however, in recompence, he could talk upon his fingers like an\r\nangel. Mi Li asked him directly who the princess was whose name was the\r\nsame with her father's kingdom? This was a little exaggeration in the\r\nprince, but nobody ever repeats any thing just as they heard it:\r\nbesides, it was excusable in the heir of a great monarchy, who of all\r\nthings had not been taught to speak truth, and perhaps had never heard\r\nwhat it was. Still it was not the mistake of _kingdom_ for _dominions_\r\nthat puzzled the governor. It never helped him to understand any thing\r\nthe better for its being rightly stated. However, as he had great\r\npresence of mind, which consisted in never giving a direct answer, and\r\nin looking as if he could, he replied, it was a question of too great\r\nimportance to be resolved on a sudden. How came you to know that? Said\r\nthe prince--This youthful impetuosity told the governor that there was\r\nsomething more in the question than he had apprehended; and though he\r\ncould be very solemn about nothing, he was ten times more so when there\r\nwas something he did not comprehend. Yet that unknown something\r\noccasioning a conflict between his cunning and his ignorance, and the\r\nlatter being the greater, always betrayed itself, for nothing looks so\r\nsilly as a fool acting wisdom. The prince repeated his question; the\r\ngovernor demanded why he asked--the prince had not patience to spell the\r\nquestion over again on his fingers, but bawled it as loud as he could to\r\nno purpose. The courtiers ran in, and catching up the prince's words,\r\nand repeating them imperfectly, it soon flew all over Pekin, and thence\r\ninto the provinces, and thence into Tartary, and thence to Muscovy, and\r\nso on, that the prince wanted to know who the princess was, whose name\r\nwas the same as her father's. As the Chinese have not the blessing (for\r\naught I know) of having family surnames as we have, and as what would be\r\ntheir christian-names, if they were so happy as to be christians, are\r\nquite different for men and women, the Chinese, who think that must be a\r\nrule all over the world because it is theirs, decided that there could\r\nnot exist upon the square face of the earth a woman whose name was the\r\nsame as her father's. They repeated this so often, and with so much\r\ndeference and so much obstinacy, that the prince, totally forgetting the\r\noriginal oracle, believed that he wanted to know who the woman was who\r\nhad the same name as her father. However, remembring there was something\r\nin the question that he had taken for royal, he always said _the king\r\nher father_. The prime minister consulted the red book or court-calendar,\r\nwhich was _his_ oracle, and could find no such princess. All the\r\nministers at foreign courts were instructed to inform themselves if\r\nthere was any such lady; but as it took up a great deal of time to put\r\nthese instructions into cypher, the prince's impatience could not wait\r\nfor the couriers setting out, but he determined to go himself in search\r\nof the princess. The old king, who, _as is usual_, had left the whole\r\nmanagement of affairs to his son the moment he was fourteen, was charmed\r\nwith the prince's resolution of seeing the world, which he thought could\r\nbe done in a few days, the facility of which makes so many monarchs\r\nnever stir out of their own palaces till it is too late; and his majesty\r\ndeclared, that he should approve of his son's choice, be the lady who\r\nshe would, provided she answered to the divine designation of having the\r\nsame name as her father.\r\n\r\nThe prince rode post to Canton, intending to embark there on board an\r\nEnglish man of war. With what infinite transport did he hear the evening\r\nbefore he was to embark, that a sailor knew the identic lady in\r\nquestion. The prince scalded his mouth with the tea he was drinking,\r\nbroke the old china cup it was in, and which the queen his mother had\r\ngiven him at his departure from Pekin, and which had been given to her\r\ngreat great great great grandmother queen Fi by Confucius himself, and\r\nran down to the vessel and asked for the man who knew his bride. It was\r\nhonest Tom O'Bull, an Irish sailor, who by his interpreter Mr. James\r\nHall, the supercargo, informed his highness that Mr. Bob Oliver of Sligo\r\nhad a daughter christened of both his names, the fair miss Bob Oliver.[1]\r\nThe prince by the plenitude of his power declared Tom a mandarin of the\r\nfirst class, and at Tom's desire promised to speak to his brother the\r\nking of Great Ireland, France and Britain, to have him made a peer in\r\nhis own country, Tom saying he should be ashamed to appear there without\r\nbeing a lord as well as all his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe prince's passion, which was greatly inflamed by Tom's description of\r\nher highness Bob's charms, would not let him stay for a proper set of\r\nladies from Pekin to carry to wait on his bride, so he took a dozen of\r\nthe wives of the first merchants in Canton, and two dozen virgins as\r\nmaids of honour, who however were disqualified for their employments\r\nbefore his highness got to St. Helena. Tom himself married one of them,\r\nbut was so great a favourite with the prince, that she still was\r\nappointed maid of honour, and with Tom's consent was afterwards married\r\nto an English duke.\r\n\r\nNothing can paint the agonies of our royal lover, when on his landing at\r\nDublin he was informed that princess Bob had quitted Ireland, and was\r\nmarried to nobody knew whom. It was well for Tom that he was on Irish\r\nground. He would have been chopped as small as rice, for it is death in\r\nChina to mislead the heir of the crown through ignorance. To do it\r\nknowingly is no crime, any more than in other countries.\r\n\r\nAs a prince of China cannot marry a woman that has been married before,\r\nit was necessary for Mi Li to search the world for another lady equally\r\nqualified with miss Bob, whom he forgot the moment he was told he must\r\nmarry somebody else, and fell equally in love with somebody else, though\r\nbe knew not with whom. In this suspence he dreamt, \"_that he would find\r\nhis destined spouse, whose father had lost the dominions which never had\r\nbeen his dominions, in a place where there was a bridge over no water, a\r\ntomb where nobody ever was buried nor ever would be buried, ruins that\r\nwere more than they had ever been, a subterraneous passage in which\r\nthere were dogs with eyes of rubies and emeralds, and a more beautiful\r\nmenagerie of Chinese pheasants than any in his father's extensive\r\ngardens_.\" This oracle seemed so impossible to be accomplished, that he\r\nbelieved it more than he had done the first, which shewed his great\r\npiety. He determined to begin his second search, and being told by the\r\nlord lieutenant that there was in England a Mr. Banks,[2] who was going\r\nall over the world in search of he did not know what, his highness\r\nthought he could not have a better conductor, and sailed for England.\r\nThere he learnt that the sage Banks was at Oxford, hunting in the\r\nBodleian library for a MS. voyage of a man who had been in the moon,\r\nwhich Mr. Banks thought must have been in the western ocean, where the\r\nmoon sets, and which planet if he could discover once more, he would\r\ntake possession of in his majesty's name, upon condition that it should\r\nnever be taxed, and so be lost again to this country like the rest of\r\nhis majesty's dominions in that part of the world.\r\n\r\nMi Li took a hired post-chaise for Oxford, but as it was a little rotten\r\nit broke on the new road down to Henley. A beggar advised him to walk\r\ninto general Conway's, who was the most courteous person alive, and\r\nwould certainly lend him his own chaise. The prince travelled incog. He\r\ntook the beggar's advice, but going up to the house was told the family\r\nwere in the grounds, but he should be conducted to them. He was led\r\nthrough a venerable wood of beeches, to a menagerie[3] commanding a more\r\nglorious prospect than any in his father's dominions, and full of\r\nChinese pheasants. The prince cried out in extasy, Oh! potent Hih! my\r\ndream begins to be accomplished. The gardiner, who knew no Chinese but\r\nthe names of a few plants, was struck with the similitude of the sounds,\r\nbut discreetly said not a word. Not finding his lady there, as he\r\nexpected, he turned back, and plunging suddenly into the thickest gloom\r\nof the wood, he descended into a cavern totally dark, the intrepid\r\nprince following him boldly. After advancing a great way into this\r\nsubterraneous vault, at last they perceived light, when on a sudden they\r\nwere pursued by several small spaniels, and turning to look at them, the\r\nprince perceived their eyes[4] shone like emeralds and rubies. Instead\r\nof being amazed, as Fo-Hi, the founder of his race, would have been, the\r\nprince renewed his exclamations, and cried, I advance! I advance! I\r\nshall find my bride! great Hih! thou art infallible! Emerging into\r\nlight, the imperturbed[5] gardiner conducted his highness to a heap of\r\nartificial[6] ruins, beneath which they found a spacious gallery or\r\narcade, where his highness was asked if he would not repose himself; but\r\ninstead of answering he capered like one frantic, crying out, I advance!\r\nI advance! great Hih! I advance!--The gardiner was amazed, and doubted\r\nwhether he was not conducting a madman to his master and lady, and\r\nhesitated whether he should proceed--but as he understood nothing the\r\nprince said, and perceiving he must be a foreigner, he concluded he was\r\na Frenchman by his dancing. As the stranger too was so nimble and not at\r\nall tired with his walk, the sage gardiner proceeded down a sloping\r\nvalley, between two mountains cloathed to their summits with cedars,\r\nfirs, and pines, which he took care to tell the prince were all of his\r\nhonour the general's own planting: but though the prince had learnt more\r\nEnglish in three days in Ireland, than all the French in the world ever\r\nlearnt in three years, he took no notice of the information, to the\r\ngreat offence of the gardiner, but kept running on, and increased his\r\ngambols and exclamations when he perceived the vale was terminated by a\r\nstupendous bridge, that seemed composed of the rocks which the giants\r\nthrew at Jupiter's head, and had not a drop of water beneath[7]\r\nit--Where is my bride, my bride? cried Mi Li--I must be near her. The\r\nprince's shouts and cries drew a matron from a cottage that stood on a\r\nprecipice near the bridge, and hung over the river--My lady is down at\r\nFord-house, cried the good[8] woman, who was a little deaf, concluding\r\nthey had called to her to know. The gardiner knew it was in vain to\r\nexplain his distress to her, and thought that if the poor gentleman was\r\nreally mad, his master the general would be the properest person to know\r\nhow to manage him. Accordingly turning to the left, he led the prince\r\nalong the banks of the river, which glittered through the opening\r\nfallows, while on the other hand a wilderness of shrubs climbed up the\r\npendent cliffs of chalk, and contrasted with the verdant meads and\r\nfields of corn beyond the stream. The prince, insensible to such\r\nenchanting scenes, galloped wildly along, keeping the poor gardiner on a\r\nround trot, till they were stopped by a lonely[9] tomb, surrounded by\r\ncypress, yews, and willows, that seemed the monument of some adventurous\r\nyouth who had been lost in tempting the current, and might have suited\r\nthe gallant and daring Leander. Here Mi Li first had presence of mind to\r\nrecollect the little English he knew, and eagerly asked the gardiner\r\nwhose tomb he beheld before him. It is nobody's--before he could\r\nproceed, the prince interrupted him, And will it never be any\r\nbody's?--Oh! thought the gardiner, now there is no longer any doubt of\r\nhis phrenzy--and perceiving his master and the family approaching\r\ntowards them, he endeavoured to get the start, but the prince, much\r\nyounger, and borne too on the wings of love, set out full speed the\r\nmoment he saw the company, and particularly a young damsel with them.\r\nRunning almost breathless up to lady Ailesbury, and seizing miss\r\nCampbell's hand--he cried, _Who she? who she_? Lady Ailesbury screamed,\r\nthe young maiden squalled, the general, cool but offended, rushed\r\nbetween them, and if a prince could be collared, would have collared\r\nhim--Mi Li kept fast hold with one arm, but pointing to his prize with\r\nthe other, and with the most eager and supplicating looks intreating for\r\nan answer, continued to exclaim, _Who she? who she_? The general\r\nperceiving by his accent and manner that he was a foreigner, and rather\r\ntempted to laugh than be angry, replied with civil scorn, Why _she_ is\r\nmiss Caroline Campbell, daughter of lord William Campbell, his majesty's\r\nlate governor of Carolina--Oh, Hih! I now recollect thy words! cried Mi\r\nLi--And so she became princess of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON TALE V.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _There really was such a person._.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _The gentleman who discovered Otaheite, in company with Dr.\r\nSolander._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Lady Ailesbury's._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _At Park-place there is such a passage cut through a\r\nchalk-hill: when dogs are in the middle, the light from the mouth makes\r\ntheir eyes appear in the manner here described._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Copeland, the gardiner, a very grave person._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Consequently they seem to have been larger._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _The rustic bridge at Park-place was built by general\r\nConway, to carry the road from Henley, and to leave the communication\r\nfree between his grounds on each side of the road.

His family were at that time under a\r\ncloud, though they could boast of being descended from Canis Scaliger,\r\nlord of Verona. The captors sold the beautiful Orondates to a rich widow\r\nof the noble family of Grimaldi, who having no children, brought him up\r\nwith as much tenderness as if he had been her son. Her fondness\r\nincreased with the growth of his stature and charms, and the violence of\r\nhis passions were augmented by the signora Grimaldi's indulgence. Is it\r\nnecessary to say that love reigned predominantly in the soul of\r\nOrondates? Or that in a city like Venice a form like that of Orondates\r\nmet with little resistance?\r\n\r\nThe Cyprian queen, not content with the numerous oblations of Orondates\r\non her altars, was not satisfied while his heart remained unengaged.\r\nAcross the canal, overagainst the palace of Grimaldi, stood a convent of\r\nCarmelite nuns, the abbess of which had a young African slave of the\r\nmost exquisite beauty, called Azora, a year younger than Orondates. Jet\r\nand japan were tawny and without lustre, when compared to the hue of\r\nAzora. Afric never produced a female so perfect as Azora; as Europe\r\ncould boast but of one Orondates.\r\n\r\nThe signora Grimaldi, though no bigot, was pretty regular at her\r\ndevotions, but as lansquenet was more to her taste than praying, she\r\nhurried over her masses as fast as she could, to allot more of her\r\nprecious time to cards. This made her prefer the church of the\r\nCarmelites, separated only by a small bridge, though the abbess was of a\r\ncontrary faction. However, as both ladies were of equal quality, and had\r\nhad no altercations that could countenance incivility, reciprocal\r\ncurtsies always passed between them, the coldness of which each\r\npretended to lay on their attention to their devotions, though the\r\nsignora Grimaldi attended but little to the priest, and the abbess was\r\nchiefly employed in watching and criticising the inattention of the\r\nsignora.\r\n\r\nNot so Orondates and Azora. Both constantly accompanied their mistresses\r\nto mass, and the first moment they saw each other was decisive in both\r\nbreasts. Venice ceased to have more than one fair in the eyes of\r\nOrondates, and Azora had not remarked till then that there could be more\r\nbeautiful beings in the world than some of the Carmelite nuns.\r\n\r\nThe seclusion of the abbess, and the aversion between the two ladies,\r\nwhich was very cordial on the side of the holy one, cut off all hopes\r\nfrom the lovers. Azora grew grave and pensive and melancholy; Orondates\r\nsurly and intractable. Even his attachment to his kind patroness\r\nrelaxed. He attended her reluctantly but at the hours of prayer. Often\r\ndid she find him on the steps of the church ere the doors were opened.\r\nThe signora Grimaldi was not apt to make observations. She was content\r\nwith indulging her own passions, seldom restrained those of others; and\r\nthough good offices rarely presented themselves to her imagination, she\r\nwas ready to exert them when applied to, and always talked charitably of\r\nthe unhappy at her cards, if it was not a very unlucky deal.\r\n\r\nStill it is probable that she never would have discovered the passion of\r\nOrondates, had not her woman, who was jealous of his favour, given her a\r\nhint; at the same time remarking, under affectation of good will, how\r\nwell the circumstances of the lovers were suited, and that as her\r\nladyship was in years, and would certainly not think of providing for a\r\ncreature she had bought in the public market, it would be charitable to\r\nmarry the fond couple, and settle them on her farm in the country.\r\n\r\nFortunately madame Grimaldi always was open to good impressions, and\r\nrarely to bad. Without perceiving the malice of her woman, she was\r\nstruck with the idea of a marriage. She loved the cause, and always\r\npromoted it when it was honestly in her power. She seldom made\r\ndifficulties, and never apprehended them. Without even examining\r\nOrondates on the state of his inclinations, without recollecting that\r\nmadame Capello and she were of different parties, without taking any\r\nprecautions to guard against a refusal, she instantly wrote to the\r\nabbess to propose a marriage between Orondates and Azora.\r\n\r\nThe latter was in madame Capello's chamber when the note arrived. All\r\nthe fury that authority loves to console itself with for being under\r\nrestraint, all the asperity of a bigot, all the acrimony of party, and\r\nall the fictitious rage that prudery adopts when the sensual enjoyments\r\nof others are concerned, burst out on the helpless Azora, who was unable\r\nto divine how she was concerned in the fatal letter. She was made to\r\nendure all the calumnies that the abbess would have been glad to have\r\nhurled at the head of madame Grimaldi, if her own character and the rank\r\nof that offender would have allowed it. Impotent menaces of revenge were\r\nrepeated with emphasis, and as nobody in the convent dared to contradict\r\nher, she gratified her anger and love of prating with endless\r\ntautologies. In fine, Azora was strictly locked up and bread and water\r\nwere ordered as sovereign cures for love. Twenty replies to madame\r\nGrimaldi were written and torn, as not sufficiently expressive of a\r\nresentment that was rather vociferous than eloquent, and her confessor\r\nwas at last forced to write one, in which he prevailed to have some holy\r\ncant inserted, though forced to compound for a heap of irony that\r\nrelated to the antiquity of her family, and for many unintelligible\r\nallusions to vulgar stories which the Ghibelline party had treasured up\r\nagainst the Guelfs. The most lucid part of the epistle pronounced a\r\nsentence of eternal chastity on Azora, not without some sarcastic\r\nexpressions against the promiscuous amours of Orondates, which ought in\r\ncommon decorum to have banished him long ago from the mansion of a\r\nwidowed matron.\r\n\r\nJust as this fulminatory mandate had been transcribed and signed by the\r\nlady abbess in full chapter, and had been consigned to the confessor to\r\ndeliver, the portress of the convent came running out of breath, and\r\nannounced to the venerable assembly, that Azora, terrified by the\r\nabbess's blows and threats, had fallen in labour and miscarried of four\r\npuppies: for be it known to all posterity, that Orondates was an Italian\r\ngreyhound, and Azora a black spaniel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing Tales are given for no more than they are worth: they are\r\nmere whimsical trifles, written chiefly for private entertainment, and\r\nfor private amusement half a dozen copies only are printed. They deserve\r\nat most to be considered as an attempt to vary the stale and beaten\r\nclass of stories and novels, which, though works of invention, are\r\nalmost always devoid of imagination. It would scarcely be credited, were\r\nit not evident from the Bibliotheque des Romans, which contains the\r\nfictitious adventures that have been written in all ages and all\r\ncountries, that there should have been so little fancy, so little\r\nvariety, and so little novelty, in writings in which the imagination is\r\nfettered by no rules, and by no obligation of speaking truth. There is\r\ninfinitely more invention in history, which has no merit if devoid of\r\ntruth, than in romances and novelty which pretend to none.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.",
