With one exception. You,\r\nSir, Miss, or Madam--whatever your country or station--are Albert\r\nWeener. As I am Albert Weener.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE\r\n\r\n_Albert Weener Begins_\r\n\r\n\r\n_1._ I always knew I should write a book. Something to help tired minds\r\nlay aside the cares of the day. But I always say you never can tell\r\nwhat's around the corner till you turn it, and everyone has become so\r\naccustomed to fantastic occurrences in the last twenty one years that\r\nthe inspiring and relaxing novel I used to dream about would be today as\r\nunreal as Atlantis. Instead, I find I must write of the things which\r\nhave happened to me in that time.\r\n\r\nIt all began with the word itself.\r\n\r\n\"Grass. Gramina. The family Gramineae. Grasses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" I responded doubtfully. The picture in my mind was only of a vague\r\narea in parks edged with benches for the idle.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was far too resentful to pay strict attention. I had set out\r\nin good faith, not for the first time in my career as a salesman, to\r\nanswer an ad offering \"$50 or more daily to top producers,\" naturally\r\nexpecting the searching onceover of an alert salesmanager, back to the\r\nlight, behind a shinytopped desk. When youve handled as many products as\r\nI had an ad like that has the right sound. But the world is full of\r\ncrackpots and some of the most pernicious are those who hoodwink\r\nunsuspecting canvassers into anticipating a sizzling deal where there is\r\nactually only a warm hope. No genuinely highclass proposition ever came\r\nfrom a layout without aggressiveness enough to put on some kind of\r\nfront; working out of an office, for instance, not an outdated, rundown\r\napartment in the wrong part of Hollywood.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a temporary drawback, Weener, which restricts the\r\nMetamorphizer's efficacy to grasses.\"\r\n\r\nThe wheeling syllables, coming in a deep voice from the middleaged\r\nwoman, emphasized the absurdity of the whole business. The snuffy\r\napartment, the unhomelike livingroom--dust and books its only\r\nfurniture--the unbelievable kitchen, looking like a pictured warning to\r\nhousewives, were only guffaws before the final buffoonery of discovering\r\nthe J S Francis who'd inserted that promising ad to be Josephine Spencer\r\nFrancis. Wrong location, wrong atmosphere, wrong gender.\r\n\r\nNow I'm not the sort of man who would restrict women to a place in the\r\nnursery. No indeed, I believe they are in some ways just as capable as I\r\nam. If Miss Francis had been one of those wellgroomed, efficient ladies\r\nwho have earned their place in the business world without at the same\r\ntime sacrificing femininity, I'm sure I would not have suffered such a\r\npang for my lost time and carfare.\r\n\r\nBut wellgroomed and feminine were alike inapplicable adjectives.\r\nTowering above me--she was at least five foot ten while I am of average\r\nheight--she strode up and down the kitchen which apparently was office\r\nand laboratory also, waving her arms, speaking too exuberantly, the\r\nantithesis of moderation and restraint. She was an aggregate of\r\ncylinders, big and small. Her shapeless legs were columns with large\r\nflatheeled shoes for their bases, supporting the inverted pediment of\r\ngreat hips. Her too short, greasespotted skirt was a mighty barrel and\r\non it was placed the tremendous drum of her torso.\r\n\r\n\"A little more work,\" she rumbled, \"a few interesting problems solved,\r\nand the Metamorphizer will change the basic structure of any plant\r\ninoculated with it.\"\r\n\r\nLarge as she was, her face and head were disproportionately big. Her\r\neyes I can only speak of as enormous. I dare say there are some who\r\nwould have called them beautiful. In moments of intensity they bored\r\ninto mine and held them till I felt quite uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"Think of what this discovery means,\" she urged me. \"Think of it,\r\nWeener. Plants will be capable of making use of anything within reach.\r\nUnderstand, Weener, anything. Rocks, quartz, decomposed\r\ngranite--anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a gold victorian toothpick from the pocket of her mannish\r\njacket and used it energetically. I shuddered. \"Unfortunately,\" she went\r\non, a little indistinctly, \"unfortunately, I lack resources for further\r\nexperiment right now--\"\r\n\r\nThis too, I thought despairingly. A slight cash investment--just enough\r\nto get production started--how many wishful times Ive heard it. I was a\r\nsalesman, not a sucker, and anyway I was for the moment without liquid\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n\"It will change the face of the world, Weener. No more usedup areas, no\r\nmore frantic scrabbling for the few bits of naturally rich ground, no\r\nmore struggle to get artificial fertilizers to wornout soil in the face\r\nof ignorance and poverty.\"\r\n\r\nShe thrust out a hand--surprisingly finely and economically molded,\r\nbarely missing a piledup heap of dishes crowned by a flowerpot trailing\r\ndroopy tendrils. Excitedly she paced the floor largely taken up by jars\r\nand flats of vegetation, some green and flourishing, others gray and\r\nsickly, all constricting her movements as did the stove supporting a\r\nglass tank, robbed of the goldfish which should rightfully have gaped\r\nagainst its sides and containing instead some slimy growth topped by a\r\nbubbling brown scum. I simply couldnt understand how any woman could so\r\nfar oppose what must have been her natural instinct as to live and work\r\nin such a slatternly place. It wasnt just her kitchen which was\r\ndisordered and dirty; her person too was slovenly and possibly unclean.\r\nThe lank gray hair swishing about her ears was dark, perhaps from vigor,\r\nbut more likely from frugality with soap and water. Her massive,\r\nheavychinned face was untouched by makeup and suggested an equal\r\ninnocence of other attentions.\r\n\r\n\"Fertilizers! Poo! Expedients, Weener--miserable, makeshift expedients!\"\r\nHer unavoidable eyes bit into mine. \"What is a fertilizer? A tidbit, a\r\npap, a lollypop. Indians use fish; Chinese, nightsoil; agricultural\r\nchemists concoct tasty tonics of nitrogen and potash--where's your\r\nprogress? Putting a mechanical whip on a buggy instead of inventing an\r\ninternal combustion engine. Ive gone directly to the heart of the\r\nmatter. Like Watt. Like Maxwell. Like Almroth Wright. No use being held\r\nback because youve only poor materials to work with--leap ahead with\r\nimagination. Change the plant itself, Weener, change the plant itself!\"\r\n\r\nIt was no longer politeness which held me. If I could have freed myself\r\nfrom her eyes I would have escaped thankfully.\r\n\r\n\"Nourish'm on anything,\" she shouted, rubbing the round end of the\r\ntoothpick vigorously into her ear. \"Sow a barren waste, a worthless\r\nslagheap with lifegiving corn or wheat, inoculate the plants with the\r\nMetamorphizer--and you have a crop fatter than Iowa's or the Ukraine's\r\nbest. The whole world will teem with abundance.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps--but what was the sales angle? Where did I come in? I didnt know\r\na dandelion from a toadstool and was quite content to keep my distance\r\nfrom nature. Had she inserted the ad merely to lure a listener? Her\r\nwhole procedure was irregular: not a word about territories and\r\ncommissions. If I could bring her to the point of mentioning the\r\nnecessary investment, maybe I could get away gracefully. \"You said you\r\nwere stuck,\" I prompted, resolved to get the painful interview over\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\"Stuck? Stuck? Oh--money to perfect the Metamorphizer. Luckily it will\r\ndo it itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't catch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look about you--what do you see?\"\r\n\r\nI glanced around and started to say, a measuring glass on a dirty plate\r\nnext to half a cold fried egg, but she stopped me with a sweep of her\r\narm which came dangerously close to the flasks and retorts--all holding\r\ndirtycolored liquids--which cluttered the sink. \"No, no. I mean\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\nI couldnt see outside, because instead of a window I was facing a sickly\r\nleaf unaccountably preserved in a jar of alcohol. I said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Metaphorically, of course. Wheatfields. Acres and acres of wheat.\r\nBread, wheat, a grass. And cornfields. Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois--not a\r\nstate in the Union without corn. Milo, oats, sorghum, rye--all grasses.\r\nAnd the Metamorphizer will work on all of them.\"\r\n\r\nI'm always a man with an open mind. She might--it was just possible--she\r\nmight have something afterall. But could I work with her? Go out in the\r\nsticks and talk to farmers; learn to sit on fence rails and whittle,\r\nasking after crops as if they were of interest to me? No, no ... it was\r\nfantastic, out of the question.\r\n\r\nA different, more practical setup now.... At least there would have been\r\nno lack of prospects, if you wanted to go miles from civilization to\r\nfind them; no answers like We never read magazines, thank you. Of course\r\nit was hardly believable a woman without interest in keeping herself\r\npresentable could invent any such fabulous product, but there was a bare\r\nchance of making a few sales just on the idea.\r\n\r\nThe idea. It suddenly struck me she had the whole thing backwards.\r\nGrasses, she said, and went on about wheat and corn and going out to the\r\nrubes. Southern California was dotted with lawns, wasnt it? Why rush\r\naround to the hinterland when there was a big territory next door? And\r\nundoubtedly a better one?\r\n\r\n\"Revive your old tired lawn,\" I improvised. \"No manures, fuss, cuss, or\r\nmuss. One shot of the Meta--one shot of Francis' Amazing Discovery and\r\nyour lawn springs to new life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawns? Nonsense!\" she snorted, rudely, I thought. \"Do you think Ive\r\nspent years in order to satisfy suburban vanity? Lawns indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lawns indeed, Miss Francis,\" I retorted with some spirit. \"I'm a\r\nsalesman and I know something about marketing a product. Yours should be\r\nsold to householders for their lawns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Should it? Well, I say it shouldnt. Listen to me: there are two ways of\r\nmaking a discovery. One is to cut off a cat's hindleg. The discovery is\r\nthen made that a cat with one leg cut off has three legs. Hah!\r\n\r\n\"The other way is to find out your need and then search for a method of\r\nfilling it. My work is with plants. I don't take a daisy and see if I\r\ncan make it produce a red and black petaled monstrosity. If I did I'd be\r\na fashionable horticulturist, delighted to encourage imbeciles to grow\r\ngrass in a desert.\r\n\r\n\"My method is the second one. I want no more backward countries; no more\r\nfamines in India or China; no more dustbowls; no more wars, depressions,\r\nhungry children. For this I produced the Metamorphizer--to make not two\r\nblades of grass grow where one sprouted before, but whole fields\r\nflourish where only rocks and sandpiles lay.\r\n\r\n\"No, Weener, it won't do--I can't trade in my vision as a downpayment on\r\na means to encourage a waste of ground, seed and water. You may think I\r\nlost such rights when I thought up the name Metamorphizer to appeal on\r\nthe popular level, but there's a difference.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a clincher. Anyone who believed Metamorphizer had salesappeal\r\njust wasnt all there. But why should I disillusion her and wound her\r\npride? Down underneath her rough exterior I supposed she could be as\r\nsensitive as I; and I hope I am not without chivalry.\r\n\r\nI said nothing, but of course her interdiction of the only possibility\r\nkilled any weakening inclination. And yet ... yet.... Afterall, I had to\r\nhave _something_....\r\n\r\n\"All right, Weener. This pump--\" she produced miraculously from the\r\njumble an unwieldy engine dragging a long and tangling tail of hose\r\nbehind it, the end lost among mementos of unfinished meals \"--this pump\r\nis full of the Metamorphizer, enough to inoculate a hundred and fifty\r\nacres when added in proper proportion to the irrigating water. I have a\r\ntable worked out to show you about that. The tank holds five gallons;\r\nget $50 a gallon--a dollar and a half an acre and keep ten percent for\r\nyourself. Be sure to return the pump every night.\"\r\n\r\nI had to say for her that when she got down to business she didnt waste\r\nany words. Perhaps this contrasting directness so startled me I was\r\nroped in before I could refuse. On the other hand, of course, I would be\r\nhelping out someone who needed my assistance badly, since she couldnt,\r\nwith all the obvious factors against her, be having a very easy time.\r\nSometimes it is advisable to temper business judgment with kindness.\r\n\r\nHer first offer was ridiculous in its assumption that a salesman's\r\ntalent, skill and effort were worth only a miserable ten percent, as\r\nthough I were a literary agent with something a cinch to sell. I began\r\nto feel more at home as we ironed out the details and I brought the\r\nknowledge acquired with much hard work and painful experience into the\r\nbargaining. Fifty percent I wanted and fifty percent I finally got by\r\ndemanding seventyfive. She became as interested in the contest as she\r\nhad been before in benefits to humanity and I perceived a keen mind\r\nunder all her eccentricity.\r\n\r\nI can't truthfully say I got to like her, but I reconciled myself and\r\neventually was on my way with the pump--a trifling weight to Miss\r\nFrancis, judging by the way she handled it, but uncomfortably heavy to\r\nme--strapped to my back and ten feet of recalcitrant hose coiled round\r\nmy shoulder. She turned her imperious eyes on me again and repeated for\r\nthe fourth or fifth time the instructions for applying, as though I were\r\nless intelligent than she. I went out through the barren livingroom and\r\ntook a backward glance at the scaling stucco walls of the\r\napartmenthouse, shaking my head. It was a queer place for Albert Weener,\r\nthe crackerjack salesman who had once led his team in a national contest\r\nto put over a threepiece aluminum deal, to be working out of. And for a\r\nwoman. And for such a woman....\r\n\r\n\r\n_2._ Everything is for the best, is my philosophy and Make your cross\r\nyour crutch is a good thought to hold; so I reminded myself that it\r\ntakes fewer muscles to smile than to frown and no one sees the bright\r\nside of things if he wears dark glasses. Since it takes all kinds to\r\nmake a world and Josephine Spencer Francis was one of those kinds, wasnt\r\nit only reasonable to suppose there were other kinds who would buy the\r\nstuff she'd invented? The only way to sell something is first to sell\r\nyourself and I piously went over the virtues of the Metamorphizer in my\r\nmind. What if by its very nature there could be no repeat business? I\r\nwasnt tying myself to it for life.\r\n\r\nAll that remained was to find myself a customer. I tried to recall the\r\nlocation of the nearest rural territory. San Fernando valley,\r\nprobably--a long, tiresome trip. And expensive, unless I wished to\r\ndemean myself by thumbing rides--a difficult thing to do, burdened as I\r\nwas by the pump. If she hadnt balked unreasonably about putting the\r\nstuff on lawns, I'd have prospects right at hand.\r\n\r\nI was suddenly lawnconscious. There was probably not a Los Angeles\r\nstreet I hadnt covered at some time--magazines, vacuums, old gold,\r\nnearnylons--and I must have been aware of green spaces before\r\nmost of the houses, but now for the first time I saw lawns. Neat,\r\nsharply confined, smoothshaven lawns. Sagging, slipping,\r\neager-to-keep-up-appearances but fighting-a-losing-game lawns. Ragged,\r\nweedy, dissolute lawns. Halfbare, repulsively crippled, hummocky lawns.\r\nBright lawns, insistent on former respectability and trimness; yellow\r\nand gray lawns, touched with the craziness of age, quite beyond all\r\ninterest in looks, content to doze easily in the sun. If Miss Francis'\r\nmixture was on the upandup and she hadnt introduced a perfectly\r\nunreasonable condition--why, I couldnt miss.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I thought suddenly, I'm the salesman, not she. It was\r\nup to me as a practical man to determine where and how I could sell to\r\nthe best advantage. With sudden resolution I walked over a twinkling\r\ngreensward and rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, madam. I can see from your garden youre a lady who's\r\ninterested in keeping it lovely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not my garden and Mrs Smith's not home.\" The door shut. Not gently.\r\n\r\nThe next house had no lawn at all, but was fronted with a rank growth of\r\nivy. I felt no one had a right to plant ivy when I was selling something\r\neffective only on the family Gramineae. I tramped over the ivy hard and\r\nrang the doorbell on the other side.\r\n\r\n\"Good afternoon, madam. I can see from the appearance of your lawn youre\r\na lady who really cares for her garden. I'm introducing to a restricted\r\ngroup--just one or two in each neighborhood--a new preparation, an\r\nastounding discovery by a renowned scientist which will make your grass\r\ntwice as green and many times as vigorous upon one application, without\r\nthe aid of anything else, natural or artificial.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gardener takes care of all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, madam--\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a city ordinance against unlicensed solicitors. Have you a\r\nlicense, young man?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth refusal I began to think less unkindly of Miss Francis'\r\nidea of selling the stuff to farmers and to wonder what was wrong with\r\nmy technique. After some understandable hesitation--for I don't make a\r\npractice of being odd or conspicuous--I sat down on the curb to think.\r\nBesides, the pump was getting wearisomely heavy. I couldnt decide\r\nexactly what was unsatisfactory in my routine. The stuff had neither\r\nbeen used nor advertised, so there could be no prejudice against it; no\r\none had yet allowed me to get so far as quoting price, so it wasnt too\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nThe process of elimination brought me to the absurd conclusion that the\r\nfault must lie in me. Not in my appearance, I reasoned, for I was a\r\npersonable young man, a little over thirty at the time, with no obvious\r\ndefects a few visits to the dentist wouldnt have removed. Of course I do\r\nhave an unfortunate skin condition, but such a thing's an act of God, as\r\nthe lawyers say, and people must take me as I am.\r\n\r\nNo, it wasnt my appearance ... or was it? That monstrously outsized\r\npump! Who wanted to listen to a salestalk from a man apparently prepared\r\nfor an immediate gasattack? There is little use in pressing your\r\ntrousers between two boards under the mattress if you discount such\r\nneatness with the accouterment of an invading Martian. I uncoiled the\r\nhose from my shoulder and eased the incubus from my back. Leaving them\r\nvisible from the corner of my eye, I crossed the most miserable lawn yet\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nIt was composed of what I since learned is Bermuda, a plant most\r\nSouthern Californians call--with many profane prefixes--devilgrass. It\r\nwas yellow, the dirty, grayish yellow of moldy straw; and bald, scuffed\r\nspots immodestly exposed the cracked, parched earth beneath. Over the\r\nwalk, interwoven stolons had been felted down into a ragged mat,\r\nrepellent alike to foot and eye. Perversely, onto what had once been\r\nflowerbeds, the runners crept erect, bristling spines showing faintly\r\ngreen on top--the only live color in the miserable expanse. Where the\r\ngrass had gone to seed there were patches of muddy purple, patches which\r\nenhanced rather than relieved the diseased color of the whole and\r\nemphasized the dying air of the yard. It was a neglected, unvalued\r\nthing; an odious appendage, a mistake never rectified.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" I began, \"your lawn is deplorable.\" There was no use giving her\r\nthe line about I-can-see-you-are-a-lady-who-cares-for-lovely-things.\r\nAnyway, now the pump was off my back I felt reckless. I threw the whole\r\nbook of salesmanship away. \"It's the most neglected lawn in the\r\nneighborhood. It is, madam, I'm sorry to say, no less than a disgrace.\"\r\n\r\nShe was a woman beyond the age of childbearing, her dress revealing the\r\noutlines of her corset, and she looked at me coldly through rimless\r\nglassing biting the bridge of her inadequate nose. \"So what?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" I said, \"for ten dollars I can make this the finest lawn in the\r\nblock, the pride of your family and the envy of your neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do better things with ten dollars than spend it on a bunch of\r\ndead grass.\"\r\n\r\nGratefully I knew I had her then and was glad I hadnt weakly given in to\r\nan impulse to carry out the crackpot's original instructions. When they\r\nstart to argue, my motto is, theyre sold. I took a good breath and wound\r\nup for the clincher.\r\n\r\nI won't say she was an easy sale, but afterall I'm a psychologist; I\r\nfound all her weak points and touched them expertly. Even so, she made\r\nme cut my price in half, leaving me only twofifty according to my\r\nagreement with Miss Francis, but it was an icebreaker.\r\n\r\nI got the pump and hose, collecting at the same time an audience of\r\nbrats who assisted me by shouting, \"What ya goin a do, mister?\" \"What's\r\nat thing for, mister?\" \"You goin a water Mrs Dinkman's frontyard,\r\nmister?\" \"Do your teeth awwis look so funny, mister? My grampa takes his\r\nteeth out at night and puts'm in a glass of water. Do you take out your\r\nteeth at night, mister?\" \"You goin a put that stuff on our garden too,\r\nmister?\" \"Hay, Shirley--come on over and see the funnylooking man who's\r\nfixing up Dinkman's yard.\"\r\n\r\nThey were untiring, shrilling their questions, exclamations and\r\ncomments, completely driving from my mind the details of the actual\r\napplication of the Metamorphizer. Anyway, Miss Francis had been\r\nconcerned with putting it in the irrigation water--which didnt apply in\r\nthis case. I thought a moment. A gallon was enough for thirty acres;\r\nhalf a pint should suffice for this--more than suffice. Irrigation\r\nwater, nonsense--I'd squirt it on and tell the woman to hose it down\r\nafterward--that'd be the same as putting it in the water, wouldnt it?\r\n\r\nTo come to this practical conclusion under the brunt of the children's\r\nassault was a remarkable feat. As I dribbled the stuff over the sorry\r\ndevilgrass they kicked the pump--and my shins--mimicking my actions,\r\ntripping me as they skipped under my legs, getting wet with the\r\nMetamorphizer--I hoped with mutually deleterious effect--and generally\r\nmaking me more than ever thankful for my bachelor condition.\r\n\r\nTwofifty, I thought, angrily squirting a fine mist at a particularly\r\ndreary spot--and it isnt even selling. Manual labor. Working with my\r\nhands. I might as well be a gardener. College training. Wide experience.\r\nAlert and aggressive. In order to dribble stuff smelling sickeningly of\r\ncarnations on a wasted yard. I coiled up my hose disgustedly and\r\ncollected a reluctant five dollars.\r\n\r\n\"It don't look any different,\" commented Mrs Dinkman dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"Madam, Professor Francis' remarkable discovery works miracles, but not\r\nin the twinkling of an eye. In a week youll see for yourself, provided\r\nof course you wet it down properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a week youll be far gone with my five dollars,\" diagnosed Mrs\r\nDinkman.\r\n\r\nWhile this might be superficially true, it was an unfair and unkind\r\nthing to say, and it wounded me. I reached into my pocket and drew out\r\nan old card--one printed before I'd had an irreconcilable difference\r\nwith the firm employing me at the time.\r\n\r\n\"I can always be reached at this address, Mrs Dinkman,\" I said, \"should\r\nyou have any cause for dissatisfaction--which I'm sure is quite\r\nimpossible. Besides, I shall be daily in this district demonstrating the\r\nvalue of Dr Francis' Lawn Tonic.\"\r\n\r\nThat was certainly true; unless I made a better connection. Degrading\r\nmanual labor or not, I intended to sell as many local people as possible\r\non the strength of having found a weak spot in the wall of\r\nsalesresistance before the effects of the Metamorphizer became apparent.\r\nFor, in strict confidence, and despite its being an undesirable negative\r\nattitude, I was a little dubious that those effects--or lack of\r\nthem--would stimulate further sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3._ My alarmclock, as it did every morning, Sundays included, rang at\r\nsixthirty, for I am a man of habit. I turned it off, remembering\r\ninstantly I had given Miss Francis neither her pump nor her share of the\r\nsale. Of course it was more convenient and timesaving to bring them both\r\ntogether and I was sure she didnt expect me to follow instructions to\r\nthe letter, like an officeboy, any more in these matters than she had in\r\nher restriction to agricultural use.\r\n\r\nStill, it was remiss of me. The fact is, I had spent her money as well\r\nas my own--not on dissipation, I hasten to say, but on dinner and an\r\ninstallment of my roomrent. This was embarrassing, but I looked upon it\r\nmerely as an advance--quite as if I'd had the customary\r\ndrawingaccount--to be charged against my next commissions. My acceptance\r\nof the advance merely indicated my faith in the future of the\r\nMetamorphizer.\r\n\r\nI dissolved a yeastcake in a glass of water; it's very healthy and I'd\r\nheard it alleviated dermal irritations. Lathering my face, I glanced\r\nover the list culled from the dictionary and stuck in the mirror the\r\nnight before, for I have never been too tired to improve my mind. By\r\nthis easy method of increasing my vocabulary I had progressed, at the\r\ntime, down to the letter K.\r\n\r\nWhile drinking my coffee--never more than two cups--it was my custom to\r\nread and digest stock and bond quotations, for though I had no\r\ninvestments--the only time I had been able to take a flurry there was an\r\nunforeseen recession in the market--I thought a man who didnt keep up\r\nwith trends and conditions unfitted for a place in the businessworld.\r\nBesides, I didnt expect to be straitened indefinitely and I believed in\r\nbeing ready to take proper advantage of opportunity when it came.\r\n\r\nAs a man may devote the graver part of his mind to a subject and then\r\nturn for relaxation to a lighter aspect, so I had for years been\r\ninterested in a stock called Consolidated Pemmican and Allied\r\nConcentrates. It wasnt a highpriced issue, nor were its fluctuations\r\nstartling. For six months of the year, year in and year out, it would be\r\nquoted at 1/16 of a cent a share; for the other six months it stood at\r\n1/8. I didnt know what pemmican was and I didnt particularly care, but\r\nif a man could invest at 1/16 he could double his money overnight when\r\nit rose to 1/8. Then he could reverse the process by selling before it\r\nwent down and so snowball into fortune. It was a daydream, but a\r\nharmless one.\r\n\r\nSatisfying myself Consolidated Pemmican was bumbling along at its low\r\nlevel, I reluctantly prepared to resume Miss Francis' pump. It seemed\r\nless heavy as I wound the hose over my shoulder and I felt this wasnt\r\ndue to the negligible quantity I'd expended on Mrs Dinkman's grass. I\r\njust knew I was going to have a successful day. I had to.\r\n\r\nIn moments of fancy I often think a salesman is more truly a creative\r\nartist than many of those who arrogate the title to themselves. He uses\r\nwords, on one hand, and the receptivity of prospects on the other, to\r\nmold a cohesive and satisfying whole, a work of Art, signed and dated on\r\nthe dotted line. Like any such work, the creation implies thoughtful and\r\ncareful preparation. So it was that I got off the bus, polishing a new\r\nsalestalk to fit the changed situation. \"One of your neighbors ...\" \"I\r\nhave just applied ...\" I sneered my way past those houses refusing my\r\nservices the day before; they couldnt have the Metamorphizer at any\r\nprice now. Then it hit my eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs Dinkman's lawn, I mean.\r\n\r\nThe one so neglected, ailing and yellow only yesterday.\r\n\r\nIt wasnt sad and sickly now. The most enthusiastic homeowner wouldnt\r\nhave disdained it. There wasnt a single bare spot visible in the whole\r\nlush, healthy expanse. And it was green. Green. Not just here and there,\r\nbut over every inch of soft, undulating surface; a pale applegreen where\r\nthe blades waved to expose its underparts and a rich, dazzling emerald\r\non top. Even the runners, sinuously encroaching upon the sidewalk, were\r\ndeeply virescent.\r\n\r\nThe Metamorphizer worked.\r\n\r\nThe Metamorphizer not only worked, but it worked with unbelievable\r\nrapidity. Overnight. I knew nothing about the speed at which ordinary\r\nfertilizers, plant stimulants or hormones took hold, but commonsense\r\ntold me nothing like this had ever happened so quickly. I had been\r\nindulging in a little legitimate puffery in saying the inoculant worked\r\nmiracles, but if anything that had been an understatement. It just went\r\nto show how impossible it is for a real salesman to be too enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nNerves in knees and fingers quivering, I walked over to join the group\r\ncuriously inspecting the translated lawn. I, _I_ had done this; out of\r\nthe most miserable I'd made the loveliest--and for a paltry five\r\ndollars. I tried to recapture the memory of what it had looked like in\r\norder to relish the contrast more, but it was impossible; the vivid\r\npresent blotted out the decayed past completely.\r\n\r\n\"Overnight,\" someone said. \"Yessir, just overnight. Wouldnt of believed\r\nit if I hadnt noticed just yesterday how much worse an the city dump it\r\nlooked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bet at stuff's ten inches high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother, you can say that again. Foot'd be closer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow it's uh fattestlookin grass I seen sence I lef Texas.\"\r\n\r\n\"An the greenest. Guess I never did see such a green before.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they exclaimed about the beauty and vigor of the growth, my mind\r\nwas racing in high along practical lines. Achievement isnt worth much\r\nunless you can harness it, and in today's triumph I saw tomorrow's\r\nbenefit. No more canvassing with a pump undignifiedly on my back, no\r\nmore manual labor; no, bold as the thought was, not even any more direct\r\nselling for me. This was big, too big to be approached in any cockroach,\r\nbuild-up-slowly-from-the-bottom way. It was a real top deal, in a class\r\nwith nylon or jukeboxes or bubblegum. You could smell the money in it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I'd have to tie Josephine Francis down with an ironclad\r\ncontract. Agents; dealerships; distributors and a general salesmanager,\r\nAlbert Weener, at the top. Incorporate. Get it all down in black and\r\nwhite and signed by Miss Francis right away. For her own good. An\r\nidealistic scientist, a frail woman, protect her from the vultures who'd\r\ntry to rob her as soon as they saw what the Metamorphizer would do. Such\r\na woman wouldnt have any business sense. I'd see she got a comfortable\r\nliving out of it and free her from responsibility. Then she could potter\r\naround all she liked.\r\n\r\nIncorporate. Interest big money. Put it on a nationwide basis. A cut for\r\nthe general salesmanager on every sale. Besides stock. Take the patent\r\nin the company's name. In six months I'd be on my way to being a\r\nmillionaire. I had certainly been right up on my toes in picking the\r\nMetamorphizer as a winner in spite of Miss Francis' kitchen and her lack\r\nof aggressiveness. Instinct, the unerring instinct of a wideawake\r\nsalesman for the right product--and for the right market. I mustnt\r\nforget that. Had I been content with her original limitation I'd still\r\nbe bumbling around trying to interest Farmer Hicks in some Metamorphizer\r\nfor his hay.\r\n\r\n\"Ja notice how thick it was?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's Bermuda for you. Tell me they actually plant it on purpose\r\nin Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\"No kiddin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessir. Know one thing--even if it looks pretty right now, I wouldnt\r\nwant that stuff on my place. Have to cut it every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bet ya. Toughlookin too. I rather take my exercise in bed.\"\r\n\r\nThat's an angle, I thought--have to get old lady Francis to modify her\r\nformula or something. Else we'll never get rich. Slow down the rate of\r\ngrowth, dilute it--ought to be more profitable too.... Have to find out\r\nhow cheaply the inoculant can be produced--no more inefficient hand\r\nmethods.... Of course the fastness of growth wouldnt affect the sale to\r\nfarmers--help it in fact. No doubt she'd had more than I originally\r\nthought in that aspect, I conceded generously. We could let them apply\r\nit themselves ... mailorder advertising ... cut costs that way.... Think\r\nof clover and alfalfa--or werent they grasses? Anyway, imagine hay or\r\nwheat as tall as Iowa corn and corn higher than a smalltown cityhall!\r\nFortune--there'd be a dozen fortunes in it.\r\n\r\nI began perspiring. The deal was getting bigger and bigger. It wasnt\r\njust a simple matter of cutting in on a good thing. All the angles,\r\nwhich were multiplying at a tremendous rate, had to be covered before I\r\nsaw Miss Francis again; I darent miss any bets. I needed a staff of\r\nagricultural experts--anyway someone who could cover the scientific\r\nside. Whatever happened to my freshman chemistry? And a mob of lawyers;\r\nyou'd have to plug every loophole--tight. But here I was without a\r\nfinancial resource--couldnt hire a ditchdigger, much less the highpriced\r\ntalent I needed--and someone else might get a brainstorm when he saw the\r\nlawn and beat me to it. I visioned myself cheated of my million....\r\n\r\nYes ... a really fast worker--some unethical promoter willing to stoop\r\nto devious methods--might pass at any moment and grasp the\r\npossibilities, have Miss Francis signed up before I'd even got the deal\r\nstraight in my mind. How could he miss, seeing this lawn? Splendid,\r\nmagnificent, beautiful. No one would ever call this stuff\r\ndevilgrass--angelgrass would be more appropriate to the implications of\r\nsuch a heavenly green. Millions in it--simply millions....\r\n\r\n\"Say--arent you the fellow put this stuff on?\"\r\n\r\nHalfadozen vacant faces gaped at me, the burdening pump, the caudal\r\nhose. Curiosity, interest, imbecile amusement argued in their expression\r\nwith the respect due the worker of the transformation; it was the sort\r\nof look connected with salesresistance of the most obstinate kind. They\r\ndistracted me from thinking things through.\r\n\r\n\"Miz Dinkman's sure looking for you. Says she's going to sue you.\"\r\n\r\nHere was an unfortunate development, an angle to end all angles.\r\nUnfavorable publicity, the abortifacient of new enterprises, would mean\r\nyou could hardly give the stuff away. My imagination raced through\r\ncolumns of newsprint in which the Metamorphizer was made the butt of\r\nreporters' humor. Mrs Dinkman's ire would have to be placated, bought\r\noff. Perhaps I'd better discuss developments with Miss Francis right\r\naway, afterall.\r\n\r\nWhatever I decided, it was advisable for me to leave this vicinity. I\r\nwas in no financial position to soothe Mrs Dinkman and it was dubious,\r\nin view of her attitude, whether it would be possible to sell any more\r\nin the immediate neighborhood. Probably a new territory was the answer\r\nto my problem; a few sales would give me both cash in hand and time to\r\nthink.\r\n\r\nWhile I hesitated, Mrs Dinkman, belligerency dancing like a sparkling\r\naura about her, came out of her garage with a rusty, rattling lawnmower.\r\nI'm no authority on gardentools, but this creaking, rickety machine was\r\nclearly no match for the lusty growth. The audience felt so too, and\r\nthere was a stir of sporting interest as they settled down to watch the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nDetermination was implicit in the sharply unnatural lines of her corset\r\nand the firm set of her glasses as she charged into the gently swaying\r\nrunners. The wheels turned rebelliously, the mower bit, its rusty blades\r\ngrated against the knife, something clanked forcibly and the machine\r\nstopped. Mrs. Dinkman pushed, her back arched with effort--the mower\r\ndidnt budge. She pulled it back. It whirred gratefully; the clanking\r\nstopped and she tried again. This time it chewed a handful of grass from\r\nthe edge, found it distasteful and quit once more.\r\n\r\n\"Anybody know how to make this damn thing work?\" Mrs Dinkman asked\r\nexasperatedly.\r\n\r\n\"Needs oil\" was helpfully volunteered.\r\n\r\nShe retired into the garage and returned with a lopsided oilcan. \"Oil\r\nit,\" she commanded regally. The helpful one reluctantly pressed his\r\nthumb against the wry bottom of the can, aiming the twisted spout at odd\r\nparts of the mower. \"I dunno,\" he commented.\r\n\r\n\"I don't either,\" said Mrs Dinkman. \"You--Greener, Weener--whatever your\r\nname is!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no possibility of evasion. \"Yes, mam?\"\r\n\r\n\"You made this stuff grow; now you can cut it down.\"\r\n\r\nUncouth guffaws from the watching idiots.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Dinkman, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Get behind that lawnmower, young man, if you don't want to be involved\r\nin a lawsuit.\"\r\n\r\nI wasnt afraid of such a consequence in itself, having at the moment\r\nnothing to attach, but I thought of Miss Francis and future sales and\r\nthat impalpable thing known as \"goodwill.\" \"Yes, mam,\" I repeated.\r\n\r\nI discarded pump and hose to move reluctantly toward the mower. Under my\r\nfeet I felt the springiness of the grass; was it pure fancy--or did it\r\ntruly differ in quality from the lawns I'd trod so indifferently the day\r\nbefore?\r\n\r\nI took the handle. If oiling had improved the machine, its previous\r\nefficiency must have been slight. It went shakily over the first inch of\r\ngrass and then, as it had for Mrs Dinkman, it stopped for me.\r\n\r\nBy now the spectators had increased to a small crowd and their dull\r\nhumor had taken the form of cheerfully offering much gratuitous advice.\r\n\"Tie into it, Slim--build up the old muscle.\" \"Back her up and take a\r\ngood run.\" \"Go home an do some settinup exercises--come back next year.\"\r\n\"Got to put the old back behind it, Bud--give her the gas.\" \"Need a\r\ndecent mower--no use trying to cut stuff like that with an antique.\"\r\n\"Yeah--get a good mower--one made since the Civil War.\" \"No one around\r\nhere got an honestogod lawnmower?\"\r\n\r\nThe last query evidently nettled local pride, for soon a blithe,\r\nbeamshouldered little man trundled up a shiny, rubbertired machine.\r\n\"Thisll do the business,\" he announced confidently as I relinquished the\r\nspotlight to him with understandable readiness. \"It's a regular\r\njimdandy.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly was. The devilgrass came irreverently above the wheels and\r\nflowed with graceful inquisitiveness over the blades, but the brisk\r\nlittle man pushed heartily and the mechanism revolved with a barely\r\naudible clicking. It did not balk, complain or hesitate. Cleanly severed\r\nends of grass whirled into the air and floated down on the neat smooth\r\nswath left behind. Everyone smiled relievedly at the jimdandy's triumph\r\nand my sigh was loudest and most heartfelt. I edged away as\r\nunobtrusively as I could.\r\n\r\n\r\n_4._ I have no sympathy with weaklings who complain of the cards being\r\nstacked, but it did seem as though fate were dealing unkindly with me.\r\nHere was a good proposition, coming just at the time I needed it most\r\nand it was turning bad rapidly. Walking the short distance to Miss\r\nFrancis' I was unable to settle my mind, to strike a mental\r\nbalancesheet. There was money; there had to be money--lots and lots of\r\nit--in the Metamorphizer, but it was possible there was trouble--lots\r\nand lots of it--also. The thing was, well, dangerous. What was the use\r\nof expending ability in selling something which could have kickbacks\r\nacting as deterrents to future sales? Of course a man had to take\r\nrisks....\r\n\r\nThe door, after a properly prudent hesitation, clicked brokenly. Miss\r\nFrancis looked as though she'd added insomnia to her other abstentions,\r\notherwise she had not changed, even to her skirt and the smudge on her\r\nleft nostril. \"If youve come about the icebox youre a week late. I fixed\r\nit myself,\" she greeted me gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Weener,\" I reminded her, \"Albert Weener--remember? I'm selling--that\r\nis, I'm going to sell the product you invented to make plants eat\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. Weener--yes.\" She produced the toothpick and scratched her chin\r\nwith it. \"About the Metamorphizer.\" She paused and rubbed her elbow. \"A\r\nmistake, I'm afraid. An error.\"\r\n\r\nAha, I thought, a new deal. Someone's offered to back her. Steal her\r\nbrainchild, negate all my efforts to make her independent and cheat me\r\nof the reward of my spadework. You wouldnt think of her as a frail\r\ncredulous woman, easily taken in by the first smooth talker, but a woman\r\nis a woman afterall.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Miss Francis,\" I argued, \"youve got a big thing here, a great\r\nthing. The possibilities are practically unlimited. Of course youll have\r\nto have a manager to put it across--an executive, a man with business\r\nexperience--someone who can tap the great reservoir of buying power by\r\nthe conviction of a new need. Organize a sales campaign; rationalize\r\nproduction. Put the whole thing on a commercial basis. For all this you\r\nneed a man who has contacted the public on every level--preferably\r\ndoortodoor and with a varied background.\"\r\n\r\nShe strode past the stove, which had gathered new accreta during the\r\nnight and looked in the cloudy mirror as though searching for a\r\nmisplaced thought. \"No doubt, Weener, no doubt. But before all these\r\nromantically streamlined things eventuate there must be a hiatus. In my\r\nhaste I overlooked a detail yesterday, trivial maybe--perhaps vital. I\r\nshould never have let you start out so soon.\"\r\n\r\nThis was bad; I was struggling now for my job and for the future of the\r\nMetamorphizer. \"Miss Francis, I don't know what you mean by mistakes or\r\ntrivial details or how I could have started out too soon, but whatever\r\nthe trouble is I'm sure it can be smoothed out easily. Sometimes, you\r\nknow, obstacles which appear tremendous prove to be nothing at all in\r\nexperienced hands. I myself have had occasion to put things right for a\r\nnumber of different concerns. Really, Miss Francis, you mustnt let\r\nopportunity slip through your fingers. Believe me, I know what a big\r\nthing your discovery is--Ive seen what it does.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned those too sharp eyes on me discomfortingly. \"Ah,\" she said,\r\n\"so soon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I began, \"it certainly acted quickly ...\"\r\n\r\nI stopped when I saw she wasnt hearing me. She sat down in the only\r\nempty chair and drummed her fingers against big white teeth. \"Even under\r\na microscope,\" she muttered, \"no perceptible reaction for fortyeight\r\nhours. Laboratory conditions? Or my own idiocy? But I approximated ...\"\r\nHer voice trailed off and for a full minute the absolute silence of the\r\nkitchen was broken only by the melodramatic dripping of a tap.\r\n\r\nShe made an effort to pull herself together and addressed me in her old\r\nabrupt way. \"Corn or wheat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said youve seen what it does. I asked you if you had applied it to\r\ncorn or wheat--or what?\"\r\n\r\nShe was looking at me so fixedly I had a slight difficulty in putting my\r\nwords in good order. \"It was neither, mam. I applied some of the stuff\r\nto a lawn--\"\r\n\r\n\"A _lawn_, Weener?\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-yes, mam.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I said--\"\r\n\r\n\"General instructions, Miss Francis. I'm sure you didnt mean to tie my\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nAnother long silence.\r\n\r\n\"No, Weener--I didnt mean to tie your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I was saying, I applied some of the stuff to a lawn. Exactly\r\naccording to your instructions--\"\r\n\r\n\"In the irrigation water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not precisely. But just as good, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"A terrible lawn. All shot. Last night. This morning--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop. What kind of grass? Or don't you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I know,\" I answered indignantly. Did she think I was an\r\nidiot? \"It was devilgrass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" She rubbed the back of her hand against her singularly smooth\r\ncheek. \"Bermuda. _Cynodon dactylon._ Stupid, stupid, stupid. How could\r\nI have been so blind? Did I think only the corn would be affected and\r\nnot the weeds in the furrows? Or that something like this might not\r\nhappen?\"\r\n\r\nI didnt feel like wasting any more time listening to her soliloquy.\r\n\"This morning,\" I continued, \"it was as green--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Weener, spare me your poetry. Show it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now, Miss Francis ...\" I wanted, understandably enough, to discuss\r\nfuture arrangements before she saw Dinkman's lawn.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately, Weener.\"\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with childish persons you have to cater to their whims. I\r\nrid myself of the pump--I'd never dreamed I'd be reluctant to part with\r\nthe monster--while she made perfunctory and unconvincing motions to fit\r\nherself for the street. Of course she neither washed nor madeup, but she\r\npeered in the glass argumentatively, pulled her jacket down decisively,\r\nthrew her shoulders back to raise it askew again and gave the swirl of\r\nhair a halfhearted pat.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to go over the matter of organizing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now.\"\r\n\r\nI was naturally reluctant to be seen on the street with so conspicuous a\r\nfigure, but I could hardly escape. I tried to match her swinging stride,\r\nbut as she was at least six inches taller I had to give a sort of skip\r\nbetween steps, which was less than dignified. Searching my mind to find\r\na tactful approach again to the subject of proper distribution of the\r\nMetamorphizer, I felt my opportunity slipping away every moment. She, on\r\nher part, was silent and so abstracted that I often had to put out a\r\nguiding hand to avert collision with other pedestrians or stationary\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nI doubt if I'd been gone from Mrs Dinkman's threequarters of an hour. I\r\nhad left a small group excited at the free show consequent upon the too\r\nsuccessful beautification of a local eyesore; I returned to a sizable\r\ncrowd viewing an impressive phenomenon. The homely levity had vanished;\r\nno one shouted jovial advice. Opinions and comments passed in whispers\r\naccompanied by furtive glances toward the lawn, as though it were\r\nsentient and might be offended by rude speculation. As we pushed through\r\nthe bystanders I was suddenly aware of their cautious avoidance of\r\ncontact with the grass itself. The nearest onlookers stood a respectful\r\nyard back and when unbalanced by the push of those behind went through\r\nsuch antics to avoid treading on it, while at the same time preserving\r\nthe convention of innocence of any taboo that they frequently pivoted\r\nand pirouetted on one foot in an awkward ballet. The very hiding of\r\ntheir inhibition emphasized the new awesomeness of the grass; it was no\r\nlonger to be lightly approached or frivolously treated.\r\n\r\nNow I am not what is generally called a man of religious sensibilities,\r\nhaving long ago discarded belief in the supernatural; and I am not\r\novercome at odd moments by mystical feelings. Furthermore I had been\r\nintimate with this particular patch of vegetation for some eighteen\r\nhours. I had viewed its decaying state; I had injected life into it; I\r\nhad seen it in the first flush of resurrection. In spite of all this, I\r\ntoo fell under the spell of the grass and knew something compounded of\r\nwonder and apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe neatly cut swaths of the little man with the jimdandy mower came to\r\na dramatic end in the middle of the yard. Beyond this shorn portion the\r\ngrass rose in a threatening crest, taller than a man's knees; green,\r\naloof and derisive. But it was not this forbidding sight which gave me\r\nsuch a queer turn. It was the mown part; for I recalled how the brisk\r\nman's machine had cut close and left behind short, crisp stems. Now this\r\npiece was almost as high as when I'd first seen it--grown faster in an\r\nhour than ordinary grass in a month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_5._ I stole a look at Miss Francis to see how she was taking the sight,\r\nbut there was no emotion visible on her face. The toothpick was once\r\nmore in play and the luminous eyes fixed straight ahead. Her legs were\r\nspread apart and she seemed firmly in position for hours to come, as\r\nthough she would wait for the grass to exhaust its phenomenal growth.\r\n\r\n\"Why did they quit cutting?\" I asked the man standing beside me.\r\n\r\n\"Mower give out--dulled the blades so they wouldnt cut no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to give up and let it grow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no. Sent for a gardener with a powermower. Big one. Cut anything.\r\nOught to be here now.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, too, honking the crowd from the driveway. Mrs Dinkman was with\r\nhim, looking at once indignant, persecuted, uncomfortable and\r\nselfrighteous. It was evident they had failed to reach any agreement.\r\n\r\nThe gardener slammed the door of the senescent truck with vehement lack\r\nof affection. \"I cut lots a devilgrass, lady, but I won't tie into this\r\novergrown stuff at that price. You got no right to expect it. I know\r\nwhat's fair and it's not reasonable to count on me cutting this like it\r\nwas an ordinary lawn. You know yourself it isnt fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you ten dollars and that's my last word.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, lady, when I get through this job I'll have to take my mower\r\napart and have it resharpened. You think I can afford to do that for a\r\ntendollar job?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten dollars,\" repeated Mrs Dinkman firmly.\r\n\r\nThe gardener appealed to the gallery. \"Listen, folks: now I ask you--is\r\nthis fair? I'm willing to be reasonable. I understand this lady's in\r\ntrouble and I'm willing to help, but I can't do a twentyfivedollar job\r\nfor ten bucks, can I?\"\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful if the observers were particularly concerned with\r\njustice; what they desired was action, swift and drastic. A general\r\nresentment at being balked of their amusement was manifest in murmurs of\r\n\"Go ahead, do it.\" \"What's the matter with you?\" \"Don't be dumb--do it\r\nfor nothing--youll get plenty business out of it.\" They appealed to his\r\nnobler and baser natures, but he remained adamant.\r\n\r\nNot to be balked by his churlishness, they passed a hat and collected\r\n$8.67, which I thought a remarkably generous admission price. When this\r\nwas added to Mrs Dinkman's ten dollars the gardener, still protesting,\r\nreluctantly agreed to perform.\r\n\r\nMrs Dinkman prudently holding the total, he unloaded the powermower with\r\nmany flourishes, making quite an undertaking of oiling and adjusting the\r\nroller, setting the blades; bending down to assure himself of the\r\ngasoline in the small tank, finally wheeling the contraption into place\r\nwith great spirit. The motor started with a disgruntled put! changing\r\ninto a series of resigned explosions as he guided it over the lawn\r\ncrosswise to the lines of his predecessor. Miss Francis followed every\r\nmotion with rapt attention.\r\n\r\n\"Did you expect this?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ay? The abnormally stimulated growth, you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes and no. Work in the laboratory didnt indicate it. My own fault; I\r\ndidnt realize at once making available so much free nitrogen would have\r\nsuch instant results. But last night--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now. Later.\"\r\n\r\nThe powermower went nicely, I might almost say smoothly, over the stuff\r\ncut before, muttering and chickling happily to itself as it dragged the\r\npanting gardener, inescapably harnessed, in its wake. But the mown area\r\nwas narrow and the machine quickly jerked through it and made the last\r\neasy journey along the wall of untouched devilgrass beyond.\r\n\r\nThe gardener, without hesitation, aimed his machine at the thicket of\r\ngrass. It growled, slowed, coughed, spat, struggled and thrashed on and\r\nfinally conked out.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Miss Francis.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"Sonofabitch,\" said the gardener.\r\n\r\nHe yanked the grumbling mower back angrily, inspecting its mechanism in\r\nthe manner of a mother with a wayward son and began again. There was\r\ndesperate determination in his shoulders as he added his forward thrust\r\nto the protesting rhythm. The machine went at the grass like a bulldog\r\nattacking a borzoi: it bit, chewed, held on. It cut a new six inches\r\nreadily, another foot slowly--and then with jolts and misfires and loud\r\nimprecations from the gardener, it gave up again.\r\n\r\n\"You,\" judged Mrs Dinkman, \"don't know how to cut grass.\"\r\n\r\nThe gardener wiped his sweaty forehead with the inside of his wrist.\r\n\"You--you should have a law against you,\" he answered bitterly and\r\ninadequately.\r\n\r\nBut the crowd evidently agreed with Mrs Dinkman's verdict, for there\r\nwere mutterings of \"It's a farmer's job.\" \"Get somebody with a scythe.\"\r\n\"That's right--get a scythe.\" \"Got to have a scythe to cut hay like\r\nthat.\" These remarks, uttered loudly enough for him to hear, so\r\ndiscouraged the gardener that after three more futile tries he reloaded\r\nhis equipment and left amidst jeers and expressions of disfavor without\r\nattempting to collect any of the money.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the failure of the powermower lightened the atmosphere.\r\nEveryone, including Mrs Dinkman, seemed convinced that scything was the\r\nsolution. Tension relaxed and the bystanders began talking in something\r\nabove a whisper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_6._ \"This will just about ruin our sales,\" I said.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis suspended the toothpick before her chin and looked at me as\r\nthough I'd said dirty words in the presence of ladies.\r\n\r\n\"Well it will,\" I argued. \"You can't expect people to have their lawns\r\ninoculated if they find out it's going to make grass act this way.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes might have been microscopes and I something smeared on a slide.\r\n\"Weener, youre the sort of man who peddles _Life Begins at Forty_ to the\r\ninmates of an old peoples' home.\"\r\n\r\nI couldnt see what had upset her. The last idea had sound salesappeal,\r\nbut it was a low income market.... Oh well--her queer notions and\r\nobscure reactions undoubtedly went with her scientific gift. You have\r\nto lead individuals of this type for their own good, otherwise they\r\nspend their lives wandering around in a dreamy fog, accomplishing\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"I still believe youve got something,\" I pointed out. \"You yourself said\r\nit wasnt perfected, but perhaps you havent realized how far from\r\nmarketable it actually is yet. Now then,\" I went on reasonably, \"youre\r\njust going to have to dilute it or change it or do something to it, so\r\nwhile it will make grass nice and green, it won't let it grow wild like\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nThe fixed look could be annoying. It was nearly impossible to turn your\r\neyes away without rudeness once she caught them. \"Weener, the\r\nMetamorphizer is neither fertilizer nor plant food. It is a chemical\r\ncompound producing a controlled mutation in any treated member of the\r\nfamily Gramineae. Dilution might make it not work--the mutation might\r\nnot take place--but it couldnt make it half work. I could change your\r\nnature by forcibly injecting an ounce of lead into your cerebellum. The\r\nchange would not only be irrevocable, but it wouldnt make the slightest\r\ndifference if the lead were adulterated with ironpyrites or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Miss Francis,\" I expostulated, \"you'll have to do _something_.\"\r\n\r\nShe threw her hands into the air, a theatrical gesture even more than\r\nordinarily unbecoming. \"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? To make your discovery marketable, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now? In the face of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Francis,\" I said with dignity, \"you are a lady and my selfrespect\r\nmakes me treat you with the courtesy due your sex. You advertised for a\r\nsalesman. Instead of sneering at my honest efforts to put your\r\nmerchandise across to the public, I think youd be better advised to\r\nworry about such lowbrow things as keeping faith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I to keep faith in a vacuum? You came to me as a salesman and I must\r\ngive you something to sell. This is simple morality; but if such a grant\r\nentails concomitant evils, surely I am absolved of my original\r\ncontract.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what youre talking about,\" I told her frankly. \"Your\r\nstuff made the grass grow too fast, that's all. You should change the\r\nformula or find a new one or else ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Or else youll have been left with nothing to sell. I despair of making\r\nthe point about changing the formula; your trust in my powers is too\r\nreverent. Again, I'm not an arrogant woman and I'll admit to some\r\nresponsibility. Make the world fit for Alfred Weener to make a living\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Albert, not Alfred,\" I corrected her. I'm not touchy, goodness\r\nknows, but afterall a name's a piece of property.\r\n\r\n\"Your pardon, Albert.\" She looked down at me with such a placatory and\r\ngenuinely feminine smile I decided I'd been foolish to be offended.\r\nShe's a nut of course, I thought indulgently, someone whose life is\r\nbounded by theories and testtubes, a woman with no conception of\r\npractical reality. Instead of being affronted it would be better to show\r\nher patiently how essential my help was to her.\r\n\r\n\"Of all people,\" she went on, searching my face with those discomfiting\r\neyes, \"of all people Ive the least cause for moral snobbery. Anxious to\r\nget a few dollars to carry on my work--and what was such anxiety but\r\nselfindulgence?--I threw the Metamorphizer to you and the world before I\r\nrealized that it was not only imperfect, but faulty. Hell is paved with\r\ngood intentions and the first result of my desire to benefit mankind has\r\nbeen to injure the Dinkmans. Meditation in place of infatuation would\r\nhave shown me both the immediate and ultimate wrongs. I doubt if youd\r\nbeen gone an hour yesterday when I knew I'd made a blunder in permitting\r\nyou to go out with danger in both hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what youre getting at,\" I said stiffly, for it sounded as\r\nthough she were regarding me as a child.\r\n\r\n\"Why, as I was sitting, composing my thoughts toward extending the\r\neffectiveness of the Metamorphizer beyond gramina, it suddenly became\r\nclear to me I'd erred about not knowing how long the effect of the\r\ninoculations would last.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you found out?\" If she brought the thing under control and the\r\neffect lasted a specified time there might be repeat business afterall.\r\n\r\n\"I found out a great deal by using speculation and logic for a change\r\ninstead of my hands and memory. I sat and thought, and though this is an\r\nunorthodox way for a scientist to proceed, I profited by it. I reasoned:\r\nif you change the genetic structure of a plant you change it\r\npermanently; not for a day or an hour, but for its existence. I'm not\r\nspeaking of chance mutations, you understand, Weener, coming about over\r\na course of generations, generations which include sports, degenerates,\r\natavars andsoforth; but of controlled changes, brought about through\r\nhuman intervention. Inoculation by the Metamorphizer might be compared\r\nto cutting off a man's leg or transplanting part of his brain.\r\nAlbert--what happens when you cut off a man's leg?\"\r\n\r\nI was tired of being talked to like a grammarschool class. Still, I\r\nhumored her. \"Why, then he has only one leg,\" I answered agreeably if\r\nidiotically.\r\n\r\n\"True. More than that, he has a onelegged disposition. His whole ego,\r\nhis entire spirit is changed. No longer a twolegged creature, reduced,\r\nhe is another--warped, if you like--being. To come to the immediate\r\npoint of the grass: if you engender an omnivorous capacity you implant\r\nan insatiable appetite.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't catch.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you give a man a big belly you make him a hog.\"\r\n\r\nA chevvy coupe, gently breathing steam from its radiator cap,\r\ninterrupted. From its turtle hung the blade of a scythe and on the\r\nnervously hinged door had been hopefully lettered _Arcangelo Barelli,\r\nPlowing & Grading_.\r\n\r\nWhile the coupe was trembling for some seconds before quieting down, I\r\nsighed a double relief, at Miss Francis' forgetfulness of the money due\r\nher and the soothing of my fears for the lawn's eating its way downward\r\nto China or India. The remark about gluttonous abdomens was disturbing.\r\n\r\n\"And of course there will be no further sale of the Metamorphizer,\" she\r\nconcluded, her eyes now totally concerned with the farmer who was\r\nopening the turtle with the air of a man expecting to be unpleasantly\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\nMr Barelli came as to a deathbed, a consoling but hopeless smile\r\nwidening his narrow face only inconsiderably. At the scythe cradled in\r\nhis arms someone shouted, \"Here's old Father Time himself.\" Mr Barelli\r\nwasnt amused. Brushing his forehead thoughtfully with tender fingers he\r\nsurveyed with saddened eye the three graduated steps of grass. The last\r\nstep, unessayed by his predecessors, rose nearly four feet, as alien to\r\nthe concept of lawn as a field of wheat.\r\n\r\n\"Think you can cut it?\" one of the audience asked.\r\n\r\nMr Barelli smiled cheerlessly and didnt answer. Instead, he uprooted\r\nfrom his hip pocket a slender stone and began phlegmatically to caress\r\nthe blade of the scythe with it.\r\n\r\n\"Hay, that stuff's not goin to stop growin while you fool around.\"\r\n\r\n\"Got to do things right,\" explained Mr Barelli gently.\r\n\r\nThe rhythmic friction of stone against steel prolonged suspense\r\nunbearably. All kinds of speculation crowded my mind while the leisurely\r\nperformance went on. The grass was growing rapidly; faster than\r\nvegetation had ever grown before. Could it grow so quickly the farmer's\r\nscythe couldnt keep up with it? Suppose it had been wheat or corn?\r\nPlanted today, it would be ready to harvest next week, fully ripe. The\r\noriginal dream of Miss Francis would pale compared with the reality.\r\nThere was still--somewhere, somehow--a fortune in the Metamorphizer....\r\n\r\nReady at last, Mr Barelli walked delicately across the stubble as if it\r\nwere a substance too precious to be trampled brutally. Again he measured\r\nthe rippling, ascending mass with his eye. It was the look of a\r\nbridegroom.\r\n\r\n\"What you waitin for?\"\r\n\r\nUnheeding, he scraped bootwelt semicircularly on the sward as though to\r\nmark a stance. Once more he appraised the grass, crooked his knee,\r\nrested his hands lightly on the two short, upraised handholds. Satisfied\r\nat length with his preparations, he finally drew the scythe back with a\r\nsweeping motion of both arms and curved it forward close to the ground.\r\nIt embraced a sudden island lovingly and a sheaf of grass swooned into a\r\nheap. I was reminded of old woodcuts in a history of the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe bystanders sighed in harmony. \"Nothing to it ... should a had him in\r\nthe first place ... can't beat the old elbowgrease. No, sir,\r\nmusclepower'll do it every time ... guess it's licked now all right, all\r\nright....\" Mr Barelli duplicated his sweep and another sheaf fell.\r\nAnother. And another....\r\n\r\n\"One of the oldest human rituals,\" remarked Miss Francis, swaying her\r\nbody in time with the farmer's. \"An act of devotion to Ceres. But all\r\nthis husbandman reaps is _Cynodon dactylon_. A commentary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Progress,\" I pointed out. \"Now they have machines to harvest grain. All\r\nuptodate farmers use them; only the backward ones stick to primitive\r\ntools and have to make a living by taking on odd jobs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Progress,\" she repeated, looking from the scythewielder to me and back\r\nagain. \"Progress, Weener. A remarkable conception of the nineteenth\r\ncentury....\"\r\n\r\nThe less intense spectators began to move off; not, to be sure, without\r\nbackward glances, but the metronomic swing of Mr Barelli's blade\r\nindicated it was all over with the rank grass now. I too should have\r\nbeen on my way, writing off the Metamorphizer as a total loss and\r\nconsidering methods for making a new and more profitable connection. Not\r\nthat I was one to leave a sinking ship, nor had I lost faith in the\r\npotentialities of Miss Francis' discovery; but she either wasnt smart\r\nenough to modify her formula, or else ... but there really wasnt any \"or\r\nelse\". She just wasnt smart enough to make the Metamorphizer marketable\r\nand she was cheating me of the handsome return which should be\r\nrightfully mine.\r\n\r\nShe'd made the stuff and deceived me by an unscrupulously worded\r\nadvertisement, now, no longer interested, she asked airily if further\r\neffort were essential. Who wouldnt be indignant? And to cap it all she\r\nsuddenly ejaculated, \"Can't dawdle around here all day\" and after\r\nsnatching up a handful of the scythings, she left, rolling her large\r\nbody from side to side, galloping her untidy hair up and down over her\r\nneck as she took rapid strides. Evidently the attractions of her messy\r\nkitchen were more to her taste than the wholesome air of outdoors.\r\nPottering around, producing another mare's nest and eventually, I\r\nsuppose, getting another victim....\r\n\r\n\r\n_7._ But I couldnt leave so cavalierly. Every leaf, stem, and blade of\r\nthe cancerous grass held me in somewhat the same way Miss Francis'\r\nintense eyes did. It wasnt an aesthetic or morbid attraction--its basis\r\nwas strictly practical. If it could have been controlled--if only the\r\ngrowth could be induced on a modified and proper scale--what a product!\r\nA fury of frustration rocked my customary calm....\r\n\r\nThe stretch and retraction of the mower's arms, the swift, bright\r\ncurving as the scythe cut deeper, fascinated me. An unscrupulous\r\nman--just as a whimsical thought--might go about in the night\r\ninoculating lawns surreptitiously and appear with a crew next day to\r\noffer his services in cutting them. Just goes to show how easy it is to\r\nmake dishonest speculations ... but of course such things don't pay in\r\nthe long run....\r\n\r\nThe lush area was being reduced, but perhaps not with the same rapidity\r\nas at first when Mr Barelli was at the top of enthusiastic--if the\r\nadjective was applicable--vigor. Oftener and oftener and oftener he\r\npaused to sharpen his implement and I thought the cropped shocks were\r\nbecoming smaller and smaller. As the movement of the scythe swept the\r\nguillotined grass backward, the trailing stolons entangled themselves\r\nwith the uncut stand, pulling the sheaves out of place and making the\r\nstacks ragged and inadequate looking.\r\n\r\nBehind me a cocky voice asked, \"What's cooking around here, chum?\"\r\n\r\nI turned round to a young man, thin as a bamboo pole, elegantly\r\ntailored, who yawned to advertise gold inlays. I explained while he\r\nlooked skeptical, bored and knowing simultaneously. \"Who would tha\r\nflummox, bah goom?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Ay?\"\r\n\r\nHe took a pack of playingcards from his pocket and riffled them\r\nexpertly. \"Who you kidding, bud?\" he translated.\r\n\r\n\"No one. Ask anybody here if this wasnt a dead lawn yesterday and if it\r\nhasnt grown this high since morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe yawned again and proffered me the deck. \"Pick any card,\" he\r\nsuggested. To avoid rudeness I selected one. He put the pack back and\r\nsaid, \"You have the nine of diamonds. Clever, eh?\"\r\n\r\nI didnt know whether it was or not. He accepted the pasteboard from me\r\nand said, peering out from under furry black eyebrows, \"If I brought in\r\na story like that, the chief would fire me before you could say James\r\nGordon Bennett.\"\r\n\r\n\"Youre a reporter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Acute chap. Newspaperman. Name of Gootes. Jacson Gootes, _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_, not _Thrilling Wonder Stories_.\"\r\n\r\nI thought I saw an answer to my most pressing problem. One has to stoop\r\noccasionally to methods which, if they didnt lead to important ends,\r\nmight almost be termed petty; but afterall there was no reason Mr Jacson\r\nGootes shouldnt buy me a dinner in return for information valuable to\r\nhim. \"Let's get away from here,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\nHe fished out a coin, showed it to me, waved his arm in the air and\r\nopened an empty palm for my inspection. \"Ah sho would like to, cunnel,\r\nbut Ahve got to covah thisyeah sto'y--even if it's out of this mizzble\r\nwo'ld.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I can give you details to bring it down to earth,\" I told him.\r\n\"Make it a story your editor will be glad to have.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Glad'!\" He pressed tobacco into a slender pipe as emaciated as\r\nhimself. \"You don't know W R. If he got a beat on the story of Creation\r\nhe'd be sore as hell because God wanted a byline.\"\r\n\r\nHe evidently enjoyed his own quip for he repeated several times in\r\ndifferent accents \"... God wanted a byline.\" He puffed a matchflame and\r\nsurveyed the field of Mr Barelli's effort. \"Hardworkin feller, what?\r\nGuess I better have a chat with the bounder--probably closest to the\r\ndashed thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Gootes,\" I said impressively, \"I am the man who applied the\r\ninoculator to this grass. Now shall we get out of here so you can listen\r\nto my story?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sonabeesh--thees gona be good. Lead away, amigo--I prepare both ears to\r\nleesten.\"\r\n\r\nI drew him toward Hollywood Boulevard and into a restaurant I calculated\r\nmight not be too expensive for his generosity. Besides, he probably had\r\nan expenseaccount. We put a porcelaintopped table between us and he\r\ncommanded, \"Give down.\" Obediently I went over all the happenings of\r\nyesterday, omitting only Miss Francis' name and the revealing wording of\r\nthe ad.\r\n\r\nGootes surveyed me interestedly. \"You certainly started something here,\r\nAcne and/or Psoriasis.\"\r\n\r\nHumor like his was beneath offense. \"My name's Albert Weener.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine's Mustard.\" He produced a plastic cup and rapidly extracted from\r\nit a series of others in diminishing sizes. \"I wouldnt have thought it\r\nto look at you. The dirty deed, I mean--not the exzemical hotdog. O K,\r\nMister Weener--who's this scientific magnate? Whyre you holding him out\r\non me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Scientists don't like to be disturbed in their researches,\" I\r\ntemporized.\r\n\r\n\"No more does a man in a whorehouse,\" he retorted vulgarly. \"Story's no\r\ngood without him.\"\r\n\r\nThat was what I thought and I'm afraid my satisfaction appeared on my\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Now leely man--no try a hold up da press. Whatsa matter, you aready had\r\nda beer and da roasta bif sanawich?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you better repeat the order. You know in these cheap places they\r\ndon't like to have you sit around and talk without spending money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Money! Eh, laddie--I'm nae a millionaire.\" He balanced a full glass of\r\nwater thoughtfully upon a knifeblade, looking around for applause. When\r\nit was not forthcoming he meekly followed my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Gootes,\" I swallowed a mouthful of sandwich and sipped a little\r\nbeer. \"I want to help you get your story.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand and pulled a handkerchief out of his ear.\r\n\r\n\"The point is,\" I commenced, sopping a piece of bread in the thick\r\ngravy, \"if I were to betray the confidence involved I couldnt hope to\r\ncontinue my connection and I'd lose my chances to benefit from this\r\nremarkable discovery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Balls,\" exclaimed Gootes. \"Forget the spiel. I'm not a prospect for\r\nyour lawn tonic.\"\r\n\r\nI disregarded the interruption. \"I'm not a mercenary man and I believe\r\nin enlightening the public to the fullest extent compatible with\r\ndecency. I'm willing to make a sacrifice for the general good, yet I--\"\r\n\r\n\"--'must live.' I know, I know. How much?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me fifty dollars would be little enough--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifty potatoes!\" He went through an elaborate pantomime of shock,\r\nhorror, indignation, grotesque dismay and a dozen other assorted\r\nemotions. \"Little man, youre fruitcake sure. W R wouldnt part with half\r\na C for a tipoff on the Secondcoming. No, brother--you rang the wrong\r\nbell. Five I might get you--but no more.\"\r\n\r\nI replied firmly I was not in need of charity--ignoring his pointed look\r\nat the remains on my plate--and this was strictly a business\r\nproposition, payment for value received. After some bargaining he\r\nfinally agreed to phone his managingeditor and propose I'd \"come clean\"\r\nfor twenty dollars. While he was on this errand I added pie and coffee\r\nto the check. It is well to be provident and I'd paid for my meal in\r\nmore than money.\r\n\r\nJacson Gootes came limply from the phonebooth, his bumptiousness gone.\r\n\"No soap.\" He shook his head dejectedly. \"Old Man said only pity for the\r\nlower mammals prevented him from letting me go to work for Hearst right\r\naway. Sorry.\"\r\n\r\nHis nerves appeared quite shattered; capable of restoration only by Old\r\nGrandad. After tossing down a couple of bourbons he seemed a little\r\nrecovered, but hardly quite well enough to use an accent or perform a\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry also,\" I said. \"Since we can be of no further use to each\r\nother--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't take a powder, chum,\" he urged plaintively. \"What about a last\r\ngander at the weed together?\"\r\n\r\nAs we walked back I reflected that at any rate I was saved from\r\nsubmitting Miss Francis to vulgar publicity. Everything is for the\r\nbest--Ive seen a hundred instances to prove it. Perhaps--who\r\nknew--something might yet happen to make it possible for me to profit by\r\nthe freak growth.\r\n\r\n\"Needs a transfusion,\" remarked Gootes as we stood on the sidewalk\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\nIndeed it was anemically green; uneven, hacked and ragged; shorn of its\r\nemerald beauty. A high fog filtered the late afternoon light to show Mr\r\nBarelli's task accomplished and the curious watchers gone. It was no\r\nsmoothly clipped carpet, yet it was no longer a freakish, exotic thing.\r\nRather forlorn it looked, and crippled.\r\n\r\n\"Paleface pay out much wampum to get um cut every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it probably won't take long till the strength is exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Says you. Well, Ive got half a story. Cheerio.\"\r\n\r\nI sighed. If only Miss Francis could control it. A fortune ...\r\n\r\nI walked home, trying to figure out what I was going to do tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_8._ I thought I was prepared for anything after the shocks of the day\r\nbefore; I know I was prepared for nothing at all--to find the grass as\r\nI'd left it or even reverted to its original decay. Indeed, I was not\r\ntoo sure that my memory was completely accurate; that the thing had\r\nhappened so fantastically.\r\n\r\nBut the devilgrass had outdone itself and made my anticipations foolish.\r\nIt waved a green crest higher than the crowd--a crowd three times the\r\nsize of yesterday's and increasing rapidly. All the scars inflicted on\r\nit, the indignities of scythe and mower, were covered by a new and even\r\nmore prodigious stand which made all its former growth appear puny. Bold\r\nand insolent, it had repaired the hackedout areas and risen to such a\r\nheight that, except for a narrow strip at the top, all the windows of\r\nthe Dinkman house were smothered. Of the garage, only the roof, islanded\r\nand bewildered, was visible, apparently resting on a solid foundation\r\nof devilgrass. It sprawled kittenishly, its deceptive softness faintly\r\nsuggesting fur; at once playful and destructive. My optimism of the\r\nnight before was dashed; this voracious growth wasnt going to dwindle\r\naway of itself. It would have to be killed, rooted out.\r\n\r\nNow the Dinkman lawn wasnt continuous with its neighbors, but, until\r\nnow, had been set off by chesthigh hedges. The day before these had\r\ncontained and defined the growth, but, overwhelming them in the night,\r\nthe grass had swept across and invaded the neat, civilized plots behind,\r\nblurring sharply cut edges, curiously investigating flowerbeds,\r\nbarbarously strangling shapely bushes.\r\n\r\nBut these werent the ravages which upset me; it was reasonable if not\r\nentirely comfortable to see shrubbery, plants and blossoms swallowed up.\r\nWork of men's hands they may be, but they bear the imprimatur of nature.\r\nThe cement sidewalk, however, was pure artifice, stamped with the\r\ntrademark of man. Indignity and defeat were symbolized by its\r\noverrunning; it was an arrogant defiance, an outrageous challenge\r\noffered to every man happening by. But the grass was not satisfied with\r\nthis irreverence: it was already making demands on curbing and gutter.\r\n\r\n\"Junior, youve got a story now. W R fired three copyboys and a\r\nproofreader he was so mad at himself. Here.\" Jacson Gootes made a pass\r\nin the air, simulated astonishment at the twentydollar bill which\r\nappeared miraculously between his fingers and put it in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I replied coolly. \"Just what is this for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, me boy, such innocence Ive never seen since I left the old sod.\r\nTis but a little token of esteem from himself, to repay you for the\r\ntrouble of leading me to your scientist, your Frankenstein, your\r\nBurbank. Lead on, my boy. And make it snappy, brother,\" he added,\r\n\"because Ive got to be back here for the rescue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rescue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. People in the house.\" He consulted a scrap of paper. \"Pinkman--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinkman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinkman. Yeah--thanks--no idea how sensitive people are when you get\r\ntheir names wrong. Dinkmans phoned the firedepartment. Can't get out.\r\nRescue any minute--got to cover that--imperative--TRAPPED IN HOME BY\r\nFREAK LAWN--and nail down your scientist at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nI was very anxious myself to see what would happen here so I suggested,\r\nsince I could take him to the discoverer of the Metamorphizer any time,\r\nthat we'd better stay and get the Dinkman story first. With\r\noverenthusiastic praise of my acuteness, he agreed and began practicing\r\nhis sleightofhand tricks to the great pleasure of some children, the\r\nsame ones, I suspect, who had plagued me when I was spraying the lawn.\r\n\r\nHis performance was terminated by the rapidly approaching firesiren. The\r\ncrowd seemed of several minds about the purpose of the red truck\r\nsquealing around the corner to a stop. Some, like Gootes, had heard the\r\nDinkmans were indeed trapped in the house; others declared the firemen\r\nhad come to cut away the grass onceandforall; still others held the loud\r\nopinion that the swift growth had generated a spontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\nBut having made their abrupt face-in-the-ground halt, the truck (or\r\nrather the firemen on it) anticlimactically did nothing at all. Helmeted\r\nand accoutered, ready for instant action, they relaxed contentedly\r\nagainst the engine, oblivious of grass, bystanders, or presumable\r\nemergency. Gootes strolled over to inquire the cause of their indolence.\r\n\"Waiting for the chief,\" he was informed. Thereupon he borrowed a helmet\r\n(possibly on the strength of his presscard) and proceeded to pull from\r\nit such a variety of objects that he received the final accolade from\r\nseveral of his audience when they told him admiringly he ought to be on\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\nThe bystanders were not seduced by this entertainment into approval of\r\nthe firemen's idleness and inquired sarcastically why they had left\r\ntheir cots behind or if they thought they were still on WPA? The men\r\nremained impervious until the chief jumped out of his red roadster and\r\nsurveyed the scene napoleonically. \"Thought somebody was pulling a rib,\"\r\nhe explained to no one in particular. \"All right, boys, there's folks in\r\nthat house--let's get them out.\"\r\n\r\nCarrying a ladder the men plunged toward the house. Their boots trod the\r\nsprawling runners heavily, spurning and crushing them carelessly. The\r\ngrass responded by flowing back like water, sloshing over ankles and\r\nlapping at calves, thoroughly entangling and impeding progress. Panting\r\nand struggling the firemen penetrated only a short way into the mass\r\nbefore they were slowed almost to a standstill. From the sidelines it\r\nseemed as though they were wrestling with an invisible octopus. Feet\r\nwere lifted high, but never free of the twining vegetation; the ladder\r\nwas pulled angrily forward, but the clutch of the grass upon it became\r\nfirmer with every tug.\r\n\r\nAt length they were halted, although their efforts still gave an\r\nappearance of advance. Thrashing and wrenching they urged themselves and\r\nthe now burdensome ladder against the invincible wall. The only result\r\nwas to give the illusion they were burying themselves in the clutching\r\ntentacles. Exertions dwindled; the struggle grew less intense; then they\r\nretreated, fighting their way out of the enveloping mass in a panic of\r\ndesperation, abandoning the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe chief surveyed them with less than approbation. \"Cut your way in,\"\r\nhe ordered. \"You guys think those axes are only to bust up furniture\r\nwith?\"\r\n\r\nObediently, wedges of bright steel flashed against the green wall.\r\n\r\n\"Impatiently I await the rescue of fair Dinkmans from this enchanted\r\nkeep,\" murmured Gootes, vainly trying to balance his pipe on the back of\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nIt looked as though he would have to contain his impatience for some\r\ntime. The firemen slashed unenthusiastically at the grass, which gave\r\nway only grudgingly and by inches. Halfanhour later they triumphantly\r\ndragged out the abandoned ladder. \"Stuff's like rubber--bounds back\r\ninstead of cutting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. And in the meantime those people been telephoning again. Want to\r\nknow what the delay is. Want to know what they pay taxes for. Threaten\r\nto sue the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let'm sue. Long as theyre in there they can't collect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny as a flat tire. Get going, goldbrick.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_9._ Another firetruck rolled up and there was much kidding back and\r\nforth between the two crews. This was clearly no situation in which\r\nlives or property were at stake; it was rather in line with assisting\r\ndistraught cats down from tops of telephonepoles or persuading\r\nselfimmolated children to unlock the bathroom door and let mommy in; an\r\namusing interval in a tense day. Perhaps those manning the second truck\r\nwere more naturally ingenious, possibly the original workers sought more\r\ndiverting labor; at any rate the futile chopping was abandoned. Instead,\r\nseveral long ladders were hooked together and the synthesis lowered from\r\nthe curb to the edge of Dinkman's roof. It seemed remarkably fragile,\r\nbut it reached and the watchers murmured approval.\r\n\r\nNo longer beset by novelty, the men took easily to the swaying, sagging\r\nbridge. They passed over the baffled grass, the leader carrying another\r\nshort ladder which he hung from the roof, stabbing its lower rungs down\r\ninto the matted verdure below. The crossing was made with such\r\ninsouciance the wonder was they hadnt done it at first, instead of\r\nwasting time on other expedients.\r\n\r\nThe firemen went down the vertical ladder and forced an entrance into\r\nthe choked windows. Mrs Dinkman came out first, helped by two of them.\r\nShe kept pinching her glasses into place with one hand and pulling her\r\nskirt modestly close with the other, activities leaving her very little\r\nto grasp the ladder with. The firemen seemed quite accustomed to this\r\nsort of irrationality, and paying no heed to the rush of\r\nwords--inaudible to us on the street--bursting from her, they coaxed her\r\nexpertly up onto the roof. Here she stood, statuesquely outlined against\r\nthe bright sky, berating her succorers, until Mr Dinkman, rounded, bald,\r\nand calm, joined her.\r\n\r\nAt first Mrs Dinkman refused to try the bridge to the street, but after\r\nsome urging which was conveyed to us by the gestures of the firemen, she\r\nventured gingerly on the trembling ladders only to draw back quickly.\r\nOne of the firemen demonstrated the ease and simplicity of the journey,\r\nbut it was vain; Mrs Dinkman was carried across gallantly in traditional\r\nmovie style, with Mr Dinkman and the crew following sedately behind.\r\n\r\n\"A crime,\" Mrs Dinkman was saying when she came within earshot. \"A\r\ncrime. Malicious mischief. Ought to be locked up for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't upset yourself, my dear,\" urged Mr Dinkman. \"It's very\r\ndistressing, but afterall it might be worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Worse'! Adam Dinkman, has misfortune completely unhinged your mind?\r\nMoney thrown in the gutter--imposed on by oily rascals--our house\r\nswallowed up by this ... this unnatural stuff--and the final humiliation\r\nof being pulled out of our own home in front of a gawking crowd.\" She\r\nturned around and shouted, \"Shoo, shoo--why don't you go home?\" And then\r\nto Mr Dinkman again, \"'Worse' indeed! I'd like to know what could be\r\nworse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now--\" began Mr Dinkman; but I didnt hear the rest, for I was\r\nafraid by \"rascals\" Mrs Dinkman referred, quite unjustly, to me and I\r\nthought the time opportune to remind Gootes he hadnt yet completed his\r\nassignment.\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" he agreed, suddenly assuming the abrupt accents of an\r\nimprobable Englishman, \"oh very right, old chap. Let's toddle along and\r\nsee what Fu Manchu has to say for himself. First off though I shall have\r\nto phone in to Fleet Street--I mean to W R.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine. You can ask him at the same time to authorize you to give me the\r\nother thirty.\"\r\n\r\nGootes lost his British speech instantly. \"What other thirty, bum?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the balance of the fifty. For an introduction to Mi--to the maker\r\nof the Metamorphizer. To compensate me, you know, for my loss of\r\nrevenue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weener, you have all the earmarks of a castiron moocher. Let me tell\r\nyou, suh--such methods are unbecoming. They suggest damyankee push and\r\nblackmail. Remember Reconstruction and White Supremacy, suh.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were hypersensitive to the silly things people say, I should have\r\ngiven up selling long before. I pretended not to hear him. We walked\r\ninto a drugstore and he dropped a nickel into a payphone, hunching the\r\nreceiver between ear and shoulder. \"Fifty your last word?\" he asked out\r\nof the corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Hello? _'Gencer?_ Gootes. Hya, beautiful? Syphilis all cleared up? Now\r\n... now, baby ... well, if youre going to be formal--gimme W R.\" He\r\nturned to me and leered while he waited.\r\n\r\n\"... Chief? Gootes. Got the Dinkman story. You know--Freak Growth\r\nSwallows Hollywood Mansion. Yeah. Yeah. I know. But, Chief--this was\r\nwhat I wanted you for--on the followup; I have the fellow who put the\r\nstuff on the grass. Yeah. Sure I did. Yeah. And the sonofabitch wants to\r\nhold us up for another thirty. Or else he won't sing. Yeah. Yeah. I\r\nknow. But I can't, Chief. I havent got a lead. I don't know, Chief, not\r\nmuch of a one, I guess. Wait a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to me. \"Listen, little man: Mr Le ffaçasé\"--he pronounced it\r\nl'fassassy and he pronounced it with awe. I too was properly solemn, for\r\nI hadnt realized before to whom he referred when he talked so lightly of\r\n\"W R.\" I knew--as what newspaper reader didnt--of William Rufus Le\r\nffaçasé, \"The Last of the Great Editors,\" but I hadnt connected him with\r\nthe _Daily Intelligencer_-- \"--Mr Le ffaçasé will shoot you another\r\nsawbuck and no more. What's the deal?\"\r\n\r\nNow, the famous editor's reputation was such that you didnt tell him to\r\ngo to the devil, even through the medium of an agent; it would have been\r\nlike writing your name on the Lincoln Memorial. It was reluctantly\r\ntherefore that I shook my head. \"I'm sorry, Mr Gootes,\" I apologized,\r\n\"I'd certainly like to oblige--\"\r\n\r\nHe cut me off with a waving hand and turned cheerfully back to the\r\ntelephone. \"No soap, Chief. O K. O K. All right--put the rewrite man\r\non.\" And for the next ten minutes he went over the events at the\r\nDinkmans', carefully spelling out all names including the napoleonic\r\nfirechief's. I began to suspect Gootes wasnt so inefficient a reporter\r\nas he appeared.\r\n\r\nThe story given in, he hung up and turned to me. \"Well, so long, little\r\nman--been nice knowing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--what about meeting the discoverer of the Metamorphizer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that. Well, W R thinks we don't need him anymore. Not enough in\r\nthat angle.\"\r\n\r\nI suspected he was bluffing; still it was possible he wasnt. In such a\r\ndelicate situation there was nothing I could do but bluff in turn. If\r\nyou are a good salesman, I always say, you must have psychology at your\r\nfingertips. \"Very well, Mr Gootes; perhaps I shall see you again\r\nsometime.\"\r\n\r\nI was immediately confronted by a Frenchman, affable, volatile,\r\naffectionate. \"Ah cher ami, do not leave me with the abruptness. You\r\ndesolate mon coeur. Alors--return to me the twenty dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr Gootes--\"\r\n\r\n\"None of it, bud.\" He whisked the cards out and showed them to me, the\r\nace of spades ghoulishly visible, its ominousness tempered only by the\r\nword \"Bicycle\" printed across it. \"Don't hold out on your Uncle Jacson\r\nor I might have the boys take you for a little trip. A block of concrete\r\ntastefully inscribed 'A Weener' ought to make an amusing base for a\r\nbirdbath, say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Gootes.\" I was firm. \"I'm reasonably certain youve been\r\nauthorized to advance me the other thirty, but I hope we're both\r\nsensible people and I'll be glad to sign a receipt for the full amount\r\nif youll let me have twentyfive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert, youre a fine fellow--a prince.\" On a page from his notebook he\r\nwrote, _Of Jacson Gootes, $50 U.S._ and I signed it. He handed me\r\nanother twentydollarbill and put his wallet away. \"Charge the other five\r\nto agent's fees,\" he suggested. \"Lead us to your Steinmetz.\"\r\n\r\nYou just can't expect everyone to have the same standards of probity, so\r\nphilosophically I pocketed my loss and gains together. Life is full of\r\nups and downs and take the bad with the good. Gootes was in high spirits\r\nafter his piece of chicanery and as we went down the street he\r\npracticed, quite unsuccessfully, a series of ventriloquial exercises.\r\n\r\n\r\n_10._ The appearance of the apartmenthouse drew the comment from him\r\nthat it was a good thing for their collective bloodpressures the Chamber\r\nof Commerce and the All Year Club didnt know such things existed in the\r\nheart of Hollywood. \"It's no better than I live in myself,\" he added.\r\n\r\nHe whistled at the dismal livingroom and raised his eyebrows at the\r\nkitchen. Before I could mutter an introduction, Miss Francis growled\r\nwithout turning around, \"If youve come about the icebox--\"\r\n\r\n\"Zounds!\" exclaimed Gootes. \"A female Linnaeus. Shades of Dorothy Dix!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know who you are, young man, but youre extremely impudent to\r\ncome tramping into my kitchen, adding nothing to the sum of knowledge\r\nbut a confirmation of my sex which would be plain to any mammal. If\r\nyouve--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nein, Fräulein Doktor,\" said Gootes hastily, \"about z' kelvinators I\r\nknow nossing. I represent, Fräulein Doktor, z' _Daily Intelligencer_\r\nzeitung--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Francis pierced his turgid explanation with a sharp spate of words\r\nin what I took to be German. Gootes answered with difficult slowness,\r\nbut he fumbled and halted before long and abandoning the Central\r\nEuropean, became again the Southern Gentleman. \"I quite understand, mam,\r\nhow any delicately reared gentlewoman would resent having her privacy\r\nintruded upon by rude agents of the yellow press. But consider, mam: we\r\nlive in a progressive age and having made a great contribution to\r\nScience you can hardly escape the fame rightfully yours. You are a\r\npublic figure now and must stand in the light. Would it not be\r\npreferable, mam, to talk as lady to gentleman (I am related to the\r\nTaliaferros of Ruffin County on the distaff side) than to be badgered by\r\nsome hack journalist?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Francis squatted ungracefully on her heels and looked up from the\r\nflowerpot she had been engaged with. \"I havent any objection to\r\npublicity, hack or otherwise,\" she said mildly. \"I am merely impressed\r\nagain by the invulnerability of newspapers to thousands of important\r\ndiscoveries and inventions, newsworthy 'contributions to Science' as you\r\ncall them in your bland ignorance of semantics, in contrast to their\r\nacute, almost painful sensitivity to any mischance.\"\r\n\r\nGootes, unjointing disproportioned length carelessly against the sink to\r\nthe peril of several jars of specimens, didnt reply. Instead he\r\nfluttered his arms and produced a halfdollar, apparently from Miss\r\nFrancis' hair, which after exhibiting he prudently pocketed.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Dr Francis--\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss. Show me how you did that trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"In a minute, Miss Francis. It's a honey, isnt it? Paid fourbits to a\r\nfunhouse in Utica, New York, for it. Tell me, how did you come to make\r\nyour great discovery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was born. I went to school. I read books. I reached maturity. I\r\nlooked through a microscope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" prodded Gootes.\r\n\r\n\"That's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lassie,\" urged Gootes, underlining the honey of his voice with a\r\ntantalizing glimpse of a rapidfire snatching of three colored\r\nhandkerchiefs out of the air, \"tis no sensible course ye follow. Think,\r\ngurrl, what the press can do to a recalcitrant lass like yoursel. Ye\r\nwouldna like it if tomorrow's paper branded you--and I quote--'an\r\nunsexed harpy, a traitor to mankind, a heartless, soulless--'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shut up. What do you want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said Gootes briskly, \"what is this stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Metamorphizer?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.\r\n\r\n\"You want the chemical formula?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldnt do me or my readers the least bit of good and you wouldnt give\r\nit to me if I asked. Why should you? No, enlighten me in English.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a compound on the order of colchicine, acting through the\r\nsomaplasm of the plant. It is apparently effective only on the family\r\nGramineae, producing a constitutional metabolic change. I have no means\r\nof knowing as yet whether this change is transmissible through seed to\r\noffspring--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hay, wait a minute. 'Producing a constitutional metabolic change.' How\r\ndo you spell metabolic--never mind, the proofreaders'll catch it. What\r\nconstitutional change?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a botanist, young man?\" Gootes shook his head. \"An\r\nagrostologist? Even an agronomist? Then you can't have the slightest\r\nidea what I'm talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not,\" retorted Gootes, \"but one of my readers might. Just give me\r\na rough idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plants absorb certain minerals in suspension. That is, they absorb some\r\nand reject others. The Metamorphizer seems to give them the ability to\r\nbreak down even the most stable compound, select what they need, and\r\nalso fix the inert nitrogen of the air to nourish themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Themselves,'\" repeated Gootes, writing rapidly. \"O K. If I get\r\nyou--which is doubtful--so far it sounds just like a good new\r\nfertilizer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really? I tried to make myself clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't get sore, Professor. Just give out on what made the grass go\r\nwild.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only hazard a guess. As I told Weener, if you create a capacity,\r\nyou engender an appetite. I imagine that patch of _Cynodon dactylon_\r\njust couldnt stop absorbing once it had been inoculated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha. Like giving a man a taste for bourbon.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it pleases you to put it that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"O K. O K. Now let's have an idea how this growth can be stopped.\r\nTheoretical, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I know,\" said Miss Francis, \"it cannot be stopped.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO\r\n\r\n_Consequences of a Discovery_\r\n\r\n\r\n_11._ \"But it's got to be stopped,\" exclaimed Gootes.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis turned silently back to her flowerpot as though she'd\r\nforgotten us. Gootes coursed the kitchenfloor like a puzzled yet anxious\r\nhound. \"Damn it, it's got to be stopped.\" He halfway extracted his pack\r\nof cards, then hastily withdrew his hand as though guarding the moment's\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n\"Otherwise ... why, otherwise itll swallow the house.\" He decided on the\r\ncards afterall and balanced four of them edgewise on the back of his\r\nhand. Miss Francis immediately abandoned the flowerpot to stare\r\nchildishly at the feat. \"In fact, if what you say is true, it will\r\nliterally swallow up the house. Digest it. Convert it into devilgrass.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cynodon dactylon._ What I say is true. How much elementary physics is\r\ninvolved in that trick?\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's terrible,\" protested Gootes. He regarded a bowl of algae as\r\nif about to make it disappear. Mentally I agreed; one of the greatest\r\npotential moneymakers of the age lost and valueless.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she agreed, \"it is terrible. Terrible as the starvation in a hive\r\nwhen the apiarist takes out the winter honey; terrible as the daily\r\nbusiness in an abattoir; terrible as the appetite of grown fish at\r\nspawning time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poo. Fate. Kismet. Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah; you are unconcerned with catastrophes which don't affect man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Local man,\" substituted Gootes. \"Los Angeles man. _Pithecanthropus\r\nmoviensis._ Stiffs in Constantinople are strictly AP stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" I broke in, \"that you are both assuming too much. I\r\ndon't know of anything that calls for the word catastrophe. I'm sure I'm\r\nsorry if the Dinkmans' house is swallowed up as Gootes suggests, but it\r\nhasnt been and I'm sure the possibility is exaggerated. The authorities\r\nwill do something or the grass will stop growing. I don't see any point\r\nin looking at the blackest side of things.\"\r\n\r\nGootes opened his mouth in pretended astonishment. \"Wal, I swan. Boy's a\r\nphilosopher.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not particularly concerned, Weener?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know any reason why I should be,\" I retorted. \"I sold your\r\nproduct in good faith and I am not responsible--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, blind, blind. Do you imagine one man can suffer and you not suffer?\r\nIs your name Simeon Stylites? Do you think for an instant what happens\r\nto any man doesnt happen to everyman? Are you not your brother's\r\nkeeper?\" She twisted her hands together. \"Not responsible! Why, you are\r\nresponsible for every brutality, execution, meanness and calamity in the\r\nworld today!\"\r\n\r\nI had often heard that the borderline between profundity and insanity\r\nwas thin and inexact and it was now clear on which side she stood. I\r\nlooked at Gootes to see how he was taking her hysterical outburst, but\r\nhe had found a batch of empty testtubes which he was building into a\r\nperilously swaying structure.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" I agreed soothingly, backing away. \"Youre quite\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked the floor as if her awkward body were a burden. \"Is the\r\ninstant response to an obvious truth--platitude even--always a diagnosis\r\nof lunacy? I state a thought so old no one knows who first expressed it\r\nand a hearer feels bound to choose between offense to himself and\r\ncontempt for the speaker. Believe me, Weener, I was offering no\r\nexclusive indictment: I too am guilty--infinitely culpable. Even if I\r\nhad devoted my life to pure science--perhaps even more certainly\r\nthen--patterning myself on a medieval monastic, faithful to vows of\r\npoverty and singleness of purpose; even if I had not, for an apparently\r\nlaudable end, betrayed my efforts to a base greed; even if I had never\r\npicked for a moment's use such an unworthy--do not be insulted again,\r\nWeener, unworthiness is a fact, insofar as there are any facts at\r\nall--such an unworthy tool as yourself; even if I had never compounded\r\nthe Metamorphizer; even if I had been a biologist or an astronomer--even\r\nthen I should be guilty of ruining the Dinkmans and making them\r\nhomeless, just as you are guilty and the reporter here is guilty and the\r\ngarbageman is guilty and the pastor in his pulpit is guilty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guilty,\" exclaimed Gootes suddenly, \"guilty! What kind of a lousy\r\nnewspaperman am I? Worrying about guilt and solutions in the face of\r\nimpending calamity instead of serving it redhot to a palpitating public.\r\nGuilty--hell, I ought to be fired. Or anyway shot. Where's the phone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I manage a minimum of privacy in spite of inquiring reporters and\r\nunemployed canvassers. I have no telephone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hokay. Hole everythings. I return immediate.\"\r\n\r\nI followed him for I had no desire to be left alone with someone who\r\nmight prove dangerous. But his long legs took him quickly out of sight\r\nbefore I could catch him, even by running, and so I fell into a more\r\nsedate pace. All Miss Francis' metaphysical talk was beyond me, but what\r\nlittle I could make of it was pure nonsense. Guilty. Why, I had never\r\ndone anything illegal in my life, unless taking a glass of beer in dry\r\nterritory be so accounted. All this talk about guilt suggested some sort\r\nof inverted delusions of persecution. How sad it was the eccentricity of\r\ngenius so often turned its possessors into cranks. I was thankful to be\r\nof mere normal intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_12._ But I wasted no more thought on her, putting the whole episode of\r\nthe Metamorphizer behind me, for I now had some liquid capital. It was\r\ntrue it didnt amount to much, but it existed, crinkled in my pocket, and\r\nI was sure with my experience and native ability I could turn the\r\n_Daily Intelligencer_'s forty dollars into a much larger sum.\r\n\r\nBut a resolve to forget the Metamorphizer didnt enable me to escape Mrs\r\nDinkman's lawn. Walking down Hollywood Boulevard, formulating, rejecting\r\nand reshaping plans for my future, I passed a radioshop and from a\r\nloudspeaker hung over the door with the evident purpose of inducing\r\nsuggestible pedestrians to rush in and purchase sets, the latest report\r\nof the devilgrass's advance was blared out at me.\r\n\r\n\"... Station KPAR, The Voice of Edendale, reaching you from a portable\r\ntransmitter located in the street in front of what was formerly the\r\nresidence of Mr and Mrs Dinkman. I guess youve all heard the story of\r\nhow their lawn was allegedly sprinkled with some chemical which made the\r\ngrass run wild. I don't know anything about that, but I want to tell you\r\nthis grass is certainly running wild. It must be fifteen or sixteen feet\r\nhigh--think of that, folks--nearly as high as three men standing on each\r\nother's shoulders. It's covered the roof halfway to the peak and it's\r\nchoking the windows and doorways of the houses on either side. It's all\r\nover the sidewalk--looks like an enormous green woolly rug--no, that's\r\nnot quite right--anyway, it's all over the sidewalk and it would be\r\nright out here in the street where I'm talking to you from if the\r\nfiredepartment wasnt on the job constantly chopping off the creeping\r\nends as they come over the curb. I want to tell you, folks, it's a\r\nfrightening sight to see grass--the same kind of grass growing in your\r\nbackyard or mine--magnified or maybe I mean multiplied a hundred\r\ntimes--or maybe more--and coming at you as if it was an enemy--only the\r\ncold steel of the fireman's ax saving you from it.\r\n\r\n\"While we're waiting for some action, folks--well, not exactly that--the\r\ngrass is giving us plenty of action all right--I'll try to bring you\r\nsome impressions of the people in the street. Literally in the street,\r\nbecause the sidewalk is covered with grass. Pardon me, sir--would you\r\nlike to say a few words to the unseen audience of Station KPAR? Speak\r\nright into the microphone, sir. Let's have your name first. Don't be\r\nbashful. Haha. Gentleman doesnt care to give his name. Well, that's all\r\nright, quite all right. Just what do you think of this phenomenon? How\r\ndoes it impress you? Are you disturbed by the sight of this riot of\r\nvegetation? Right into the microphone....\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh ... hello ... well, I guess I havent ... uh anything much to say ...\r\npretty color ... bad stuff, I guess. Gladsnotgrowing myyard....\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, go right on, sir. Oh ... the gentleman is through. Very\r\ninteresting and thank you.\r\n\r\n\"Theyre bringing up a whole crew of weedburners now--going to try and\r\nget this thing under control. The men all have tanks of oil or kerosene\r\non their backs. Wait a minute, folks, I want to find out for sure\r\nwhether it's oil or kerosene. Mumble. Mumble. Well, folks, I'm sorry,\r\nbut this gentleman doesnt know exactly what's in the tanks. Anyway it's\r\nkerosene or oil and there are long hoses with wide nozzles at the end.\r\nSomething like vacuumcleaners. Well, that's not quite right. Anyway\r\ntheyre lighting the nozzles now. Makes a big whoosh. Now I'll bring the\r\nmicrophone closer and maybe you can catch the noise of the flame. Hear\r\nit? That's quite a roar. I guess old Mr Grass is cooked now.\r\n\r\n\"Now these boys are advancing in a straight line from the street up over\r\nthe curb, holding their fiery torches in front of them. The devilgrass\r\nis shriveling up. Yessir, it's shriveling right up--like a gob of\r\ntobaccojuice on a hot stove. Theyve burned about two feet of it away\r\nalready. Nothing left but some smoking stems. Quite a lot of smoking\r\nstems--a regular compact mass of them--but all the green stuff has been\r\nburned right off. Yes, folks, burned clean off; I wish we had television\r\nhere so I could show you how that thick pad of stems lies there without\r\na bit of life left in it.\r\n\r\n\"Now theyre uncovering the sidewalk. I'm following right behind with the\r\nmicrophone--maybe you can hear the roar of the weedburners again. Now\r\nI'd like to have you keep in mind the height of this grass. You never\r\nsaw grass as tall as this unless youve been in the jungle or South\r\nAmerica or someplace where grass grows this high. I mean high. Even here\r\nat the sidewalk it's well over a man's head, seven or eight feet. And\r\nthis crew is carving right into it, cutting it like steel with an\r\nacetylenetorch. Theyre making big holes in it. You hear that hissing?\r\nThat noise like a steamhose? Well, that's the grass shriveling. Think of\r\nit--grass with so much sap inside it hisses. It's drying right up in a\r\none-two-three! Now the top part is falling down--toppling\r\nforward--coming like a breaking wave. Oops! Hay.... It put out one of\r\nthe torches by smothering it. Drowned it in grass. Nothing serious--the\r\nboy's got it lit again. Progress is slow here, folks--youve got to\r\nrealize this stuff's about ten feet high. Further in it's anyway sixteen\r\nfeet. Fighting it's like battling an octopus with a million arms. The\r\nstuff writhes around and grows all the time. It's terrific. Imagine\r\ntangles of barbedwire, hundreds and hundreds of bales or rolls or\r\nhowever barbedwire comes, covering your frontyard and house--only it\r\nisnt barbedwire at all, but green, living grass.... Just a minute,\r\nfolks, I'm having a little trouble with my microphone cable. Nothing\r\nserious, you understand--tangled a bit in the grass behind me. Those\r\nburnt stems. Stand by for just a minute....\"\r\n\r\n\"This is KPAR, The Voice of Edendale. Due to mechanical difficulties\r\nthere will be a brief musical interlude until contact is resumed with\r\nour portable transmitter bringing you an onthespot account of the\r\nunusual grass....\"\r\n\r\n\"Kirk, Quork, krrmp--AR's portable transmitter. Here I am again, folks,\r\nin the street in front of the Dinkman residence--a little out of breath,\r\nbut none the worse off, ready to resume the blowbyblow story of the\r\nfight against the devilgrass. That was a little trouble back there, but\r\nit's all right now. Seems the weedburners hadnt quite finished off the\r\ngrass in the parkwaystrip between the curb and the sidewalk and after I\r\ndragged my microphone cable across it, it sort of--well, it sort of came\r\nto life again and tangled up the cable. It's all right now though.\r\nEverything under control. The boys with the weedburners have come back\r\nand are going over the parkwaystrip again, just to make sure.\r\n\r\n\"I want to tell you--this stuff really can grow. It's amazing, simply\r\namazing. Youve heard of plants growing while you look at them; well,\r\nthis grows while you don't look at it. It grows while your back is\r\nturned. Just to give you an example: while the boys have been busy a\r\nsecond time with the parkwaystrip, the grass has come back and grown\r\nagain over all they burned up beyond the sidewalk. And now it's starting\r\nto come back over the concrete. You can actually see it move. The\r\ncreepers run out in front and crawl ahead like thousands of little green\r\nsnakes. Imagine seeing grass traveling forward like an army of worms. An\r\narmy you can't stop. Because it's alive. Alive and coming at you. It's\r\nalive. It's alive. It's al--\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Station KPAR. We will resume our regular programs immediately\r\nfollowing the timesignal. Now we bring you a message from the\r\nmanufacturers of Chewachoc, the Candy Laxative with the Hole....\"\r\n\r\nI continued thoughtfully down the street. The _Daily Intelligencer_ was\r\nspread on a newsstand, a smudgy black bannerhead fouling its pure bosom.\r\nCITY COUNCIL MEETS TO END GRASS MENACE.\r\n\r\nI trusted so. Quickly. I was tired of Mrs Dinkman's lawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_13._ \"Weener sahib, fate has tied us together.\"\r\n\r\nI hoped not. I was weary of Gootes and his phony accents.\r\n\r\n\"On account of your female Burbank, your scientess (scientistess is a\r\ntwister. Peder Piber et a peg of piggled pebbers) won't play ball with W\r\nR. The chief offered her a fabulous sum--'much beer in little kegs, many\r\ndozen hardboiled eggs, and goodies to a fabulous amount'--fabulous for W\r\nR, that is--to act as special writer on the grass business. J S Francis,\r\nWorld Renowned Chemist, exclusively in the _Intelligencer_. You know.\r\nSuppress her unfortunate sex. ORIGINATOR OF WILD GRASS TELLS ALL.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway she didnt grasp her chance. Practically told W R to go to hell.\r\nPractically told him to go to hell,\" he repeated, evidently torn\r\nbetween reprehension at the sacrilege and admiration of the daring.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis plainly had what might be described as talent that way. I\r\ndebated whether to inform Gootes of my discovery of her craziness and\r\ndecided against it on the bare possibility it would be unwise to lower\r\nthe value of my connection with the Metamorphizer's discoverer. I was\r\nsoon rewarded for my caution.\r\n\r\n\"O Weeneru san,\" continued Gootes, evidently in an oriental vein\r\ntraveling westward, \"not too hard for you to be picking up few yen. You\r\ndo not hate fifty potatoes from Editor san yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty,\" I corrected.\r\n\r\n\"Forty, fifty--what's the difference so long as youre healthy?\" He\r\nproduced a card, showed it, tore it in half, waved his hand and\r\nexhibited it whole and unharmed. \"No kidding, chum; the old man has the\r\nbug to make _you_ a special correspondent--on my advice\r\nyunderstand--always looking out for my pals.\"\r\n\r\nWell, why not? The wheel of Fortune had been a long time turning before\r\nstopping at the proper spot. I had never had any doubt I'd someday be in\r\na position to prove my writing ability. Now all those who had sneered at\r\nme years before--my English teachers and editors who had been too\r\njealous to recognize my existence by anything more courteous than a\r\nprinted rejection--would have to acknowledge their injustice. And in the\r\nmeantime all my accumulated experience had been added to enhance my\r\noriginal talent. I'd sold everything that could be sold doortodoor and a\r\nman acquires not only an ease with words but a wide knowledge of human\r\nnature this way. Certainly I was better equipped all around than many of\r\nthese highly advertised magazine or newspaper authors.\r\n\r\n\"Well ... I don't know if I could spare the time....\"\r\n\r\n\"O K, bigshot. Let me know if the market goes down and I'll come around\r\nand put up more margin.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much will Mr Le ffaçasé--\"\r\n\r\n\"How the hell do I know? More than youre worth--more than I'm getting,\r\nbecause youre a ninetyday wonder, the guy who put the crap on the grass\r\nand sent it nuts. Less than he'd have given Minerva-Medusa. Come and get\r\nit straight from the horse's mouth.\"\r\n\r\nMy only previous visits to newspaper offices had been to place\r\nadvertisements, but I was prepared to find the _Daily Intelligencer_ a\r\nveritable hive of activity. Perhaps some part of the big building which\r\nhoused the paper did hum, but not the floor devoted to the editorial\r\nstaff. That simply dozed. Gootes led me from the elevator through an\r\nenormous room where men and an occasional woman sat indolently before\r\ntypewriters, stared druggedly into space or flew paper airplanes out of\r\nopen windows. The only sign of animation I saw as we walked what might\r\nwell have been a quartermile was one reporter (I judged him such by the\r\nundersized hat on the back of his head) who enthusiastically munched a\r\nsandwich while perusing a magazine containing photographs of women with\r\nuncovered breasts. Even the nipples showed.\r\n\r\nBeyond the cityroom was a battery of private offices. I will certainly\r\nnot conceal the existence of my extreme nervousness as we neared the\r\nproximity of the famous editor. I hung back from the groundglass door\r\ninscribed in shabby, peeling letters--in distinction to its neighbors,\r\nnewly and brightly painted--W.R. Le ffaçasé. Gootes, noting my\r\ntrepidation, put on the brogue of a burlesque Irishman.\r\n\r\n\"Is it afraid of Himself you are, me boy? Sure, think no more of it.\r\nFaith, and wasnt he born Billy Casey; no better than the rest of us for\r\nall his mother was a Clancy and related to the Finnegans? He's written\r\nso often about coming from noble Huguenot stock he almost believes it\r\nhimself, but the Huguenots were dirty Protestants and when his time\r\ncomes W R'll send for the priest and take the last sacraments like the\r\ntrue son of the Church he is in his heart. So buck up, me boy, and come\r\nin and view the biggest faker in journalism.\"\r\n\r\nBut Gootes' flippancy reassured me no more than did the bare sunlit\r\noffice behind the door. I had somehow, perhaps from the movies, expected\r\nto see an editor's desk piled with copypaper while he himself used\r\nhalfadozen telephones at once, simultaneously making incomprehensible\r\ngestures at countless underlings. But Mr Le ffaçasé's desk was nude\r\nexcept for an enameled snuffbox and a signed photograph of a president\r\nwhose administration had been subjected daily to the editor's bitterest\r\njabs. On the walls hung framed originals of the more famous political\r\ncartoons of the last quartercentury, but neither telephone nor scrap of\r\nmanuscript was in evidence.\r\n\r\nBut who could examine that office with detached scrutiny while William\r\nRufus Le ffaçasé occupied it? Somnolent in a leather armchair, he opened\r\ntiny, sunken eyes to regard us with less than interest as we entered.\r\nUnder a shiny alpaca coat he wore an oldfashioned collarless shirt whose\r\nneckband was fastened with a diamond stud. Neither collar nor tie\r\ncompeted with the brilliance of this flashing gem resting in a shaven\r\nstubblefold of his draped neck. His face was remarkably long, his\r\nupperlip stretching interminably from a mouth looking to have been\r\nfreshly smeared with vaseline to a nose not unlike a golfclub in shape.\r\nFrom the snuffbox on his desk, which I'd imagined a pretty ornament or\r\nreceptacle for small objects, he scooped with a flat thumb a conical\r\nmound of graybrown dust and this, with a sweeping upward motion, he\r\npushed into a gaping nostril.\r\n\r\n\"Chief, this is Albert Weener.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do, Mr Weener. Gootes, who the bloody hell is Weener?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Chief, he's the guy who put the stuff on the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" He surveyed me with the attention due a worthy but not\r\nparticularly valuable specimen. \"You bit the dog, ay, Weener?\"\r\n\r\nGootes burst into a high, appreciative cackle. Le ffaçasé turned the\r\ndeathray of his left eye on him. \"Youre a syncophant, Gootes,\" he stated\r\nflatly, \"a miserable groveling lowlivered cringing fawning mealymouthed\r\nchickenhearted toadeating arselicking, slobbering syncophant.\"\r\n\r\nI couldnt see how we were ever to reach the point this way, so I\r\nventured, \"I understand in view of the fact that I inoculated Mrs\r\nDinkman's lawn you want me to contribute--\"\r\n\r\n\"Desires grow smaller as intelligence expands,\" growled Le ffaçasé. \"I\r\nwant nothing except to find a few undisturbed moments in which to read\r\nthe work of the immortal Hobbes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I understood you wished me to report the progress\r\nof the wildly growing grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cityeditor's province,\" he declared uninterestedly.\r\n\r\n\"No such thing on the _Intelligencer_,\" Gootes informed me in a loud\r\nwhisper. Le ffaçasé, who evidently heard him, glared, reached down and\r\nretrieved the telephone from its concealment under the desk and snarled\r\ninto the mouthpiece, \"I hate to interrupt your crapgame with the trivial\r\nconcerns of this organ men called a newspaper till you got on the\r\npayroll. I'm sending you a man who knows something about the crazy\r\ngrass. Divorce yourself from whatever pornography youre gloating over at\r\nthe moment to see if we can use him.\"\r\n\r\nHis immediate obliviousness to our presence was so insulting that if\r\nGootes had not made the first move to leave I should have done so\r\nmyself. I don't know what vast speculations swept upon him as he hung up\r\nthe telephone, but I thought he might at least have had the courtesy to\r\nnod a dismissal.\r\n\r\n\"Youre hired, bejesus,\" proclaimed Gootes, and of course I was, for\r\nthere was no doubt a brilliantly successful figure like Le\r\nffaçasé--whatever my opinion of his intemperate language or failure in\r\nthe niceties of deportment, he was a forceful man--had sized me up in a\r\nflash and sensed my ability before I'd written a single line for his\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n_14._ The wage offered by the _Daily Intelligencer_--even assuming, as\r\nthey undoubtedly did, that the affair of the grass would be over shortly\r\nand my service ended--was high enough to warrant my buying a secondhand\r\ncar. A previous unpleasantness with a financecompany made the\r\ntransaction difficult, with as little cash as I had on hand, but a\r\nphonecall to the paper established my bonafides and I was soon driving\r\nout Sunset Boulevard in a tomatocolored roadster, meditating on the\r\nlongdelayed upsurge of my fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe street was closed off by a road barrier quite some distance away and\r\ntightly parked cars testified to the attraction of the expanding grass.\r\nScorning these idle sightseers, I pushed and shoved my way forward to\r\nwhat had now become the focus of all my interests.\r\n\r\nThe Dinkmans had lived in a city block, an urban entity. It was no\r\npretentious group of houses, nor was it a repetitive design out of some\r\nsubdividing contractor's greedy mind. Moderatesized, mediumpriced,\r\nmiddleclass bungalows; these were the homes of the Dinkmans and their\r\nneighbors; a sample from a pattern which varied but was basically the\r\nsame here and in Oakland, Seattle and St. Louis; in Chicago,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston and Cleveland.\r\n\r\nBut now I looked upon no city scene, no picture built upon the\r\nsubstantial foundation of daddy at the office all day, fixing a leaky\r\nfaucet of an evening, painting the woodwork during his summer vacation;\r\nor mom, after a pleasant afternoon with the girls, unstintedly opening\r\ncans for supper and harassedly watching the cleaning woman who came in\r\nonce a week. An alien presence, a rude fist through the canvas negated\r\nthe convention that this was a picture of reality. A coneshaped hill\r\nrose to a blurred point, marking the burialplace of the Dinkman house.\r\nIt was a child's drawing of a coneshaped hill, done in green crayon; too\r\nsymmetrical, too evenly and heavily green to be a spontaneous product of\r\nnature; man's unimaginative hand was apparent in its composition.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the cone flowed past the doors and windows of the adjacent\r\nhouses, blocking them as it had previously blocked the Dinkmans', but\r\ntheir inhabitants, forewarned, had gone. More than mere desertion was\r\nimplied in their going; there was an implicit surrender, abandonment to\r\nthe invader. The base of the cone, accepting capitulation and still\r\naggressive, had reached to the lawns beyond, warning these householders\r\ntoo to be ready for flight; over backfences to dwellings fronting\r\nanother street, and establishing itself firmly over the concrete\r\npavement before the Dinkmans' door.\r\n\r\nI would be suppressing part of the truth if I did not admit that for the\r\nsmallest moment some perverted pride made me cherish this hill as my\r\nwork, my creation. But for me it would not have existed. I had done\r\nsomething notable, I had caused a stir; it was the same kind of\r\nsensation, I imagine, which makes criminals boast of their crimes.\r\n\r\nI quickly dismissed this morbid thought, but it was succeeded by one\r\nalmost equally unhealthy, for I was ridden by a sudden wild impulse to\r\ntouch, feel, walk on, roll in the encroaching grass. I tried to control\r\nmyself, but no willing of mine could prevent me from going up and\r\nletting the long runners slip through my half open hands. It was like\r\nreceiving some sort of electric shock. Though the blades were soft and\r\ntender, the stems communicated to my palms a feeling of surging\r\nvitality, implacable life and ineluctable strength. I drew back from the\r\ngreen mass as though I had been doing something venturesome.\r\n\r\nFor, no matter what botanists or naturalists may tell us to the\r\ncontrary, we habitually think of plantlife as fixed and stolid,\r\ninsensate and quiescent. But this abnormal growth was no passive lawn,\r\nno sleepy patch of vegetation. As I stood there with fascinated\r\nattention, the thing moved and kept on moving; not in one place, but in\r\nthousands; not in one direction, but toward all points of the compass.\r\nIt writhed and twisted in nightmarish unease, expanding, extending,\r\nincreasing; spreading, spreading, spreading. Its movement, by human\r\nstandards, was slow, but it was so monstrous to see this great mass of\r\nverdure move at all that it appeared to be going with express speed,\r\ninexorably enveloping everything in its path. A crack in the roadway\r\ndisappeared under it, a shrub was swallowed up, a patch of wall\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe eye shifted from whole to detail and back again. The overrun crack\r\nwas duplicated by an untouched one a few inches away--it too went; the\r\nfine tentacles on top of the mound reached upward, shimmering like the\r\nair on a hot summer's day, and near my feet hundreds of runners crept\r\never closer, the pale stolons shiny and brittle, supporting the\r\nominously bristling green leaves.\r\n\r\nI hope Ive not given the impression there was no human activity all this\r\nwhile, that nothing was being done to combat the living glacier. On the\r\ncontrary, there was tremendous bustle and industry. The weedburning crew\r\nwas still fighting a rearguard action, gaining momentary successes here\r\nand there, driving back the invading tendrils as they wriggled over\r\nconcrete sidewalk and roadway, only to be defeated as the main mass,\r\npiling higher and ever higher, toppled forward on the temporarily\r\nredeemed areas. For on this vastly thicker bulk the smoky fingers of\r\nflame had no more effect than did the exertions of the scythemen,\r\nhacking futilely away at the tough intricacies, or the rattling reapers\r\nentangling themselves to become like waterlogged ships.\r\n\r\nBut greatest hopes were now being pinned on a new weapon. A dozen black\r\nand sootylooking tanktrucks had come up and from them, like the arms of\r\na squid, thick hoses lazily uncoiled. Hundreds of gallons of dark\r\ncrudeoil were being poured upon the grass. At least ten bystanders\r\neagerly explained to any who would listen the purpose and value of this\r\nmaneuver. Petroleum, deadly enemy of all rooted things, would\r\nunquestionably kill the weed. They might as well call off all the other\r\nsilly efforts, for in a day or two, as soon as the oil soaked into the\r\nground, the roots would die, the monster collapse and wither away. I\r\nwanted with all my heart to believe in this hope, but when I compared\r\nthe feeble brown trickle to the vast green body I was gravely doubtful.\r\n\r\nShaken and thoughtful, I went back to my car and drove homeward,\r\nreflecting on the fortuitousness of human actions. Had I not answered\r\nMiss Francis' ad someone else would have been the agent of calamity; had\r\nMrs Dinkman been away from home that day another place than hers, or\r\nperhaps no place at all, might have been engulfed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I might still be searching for a chance to prove my\r\nmerit to the world. It seemed to me suddenly man was but a helpless\r\ncreature afterall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_15._ It wasnt until I was almost at my own frontdoor I remembered the\r\npurpose of my visit, which was not to draw philosophic conclusions, but\r\nto order my impressions so the columns of the _Daily Intelligencer_\r\nmight benefit by the reactions of one so closely connected with the\r\nspread of the devilgrass. I began tentatively putting sentences together\r\nand by the time I got to my room and sat down with pencil and paper, I\r\nwas in a ferment of creative activity.\r\n\r\nNow I cannot account for this, but the instant I took the pencil in my\r\nfingers all thought of the grass left my mind. No effort to summon back\r\nthose fine rolling sentences was of the least avail. I slapped my\r\nforehead and muttered, \"Grass, grass, Bermuda, _Cynodon dactylon_\"\r\naloud, varying it with such key words as \"Dinkman, swallowing up, green\r\nhill\" and the like, but all I could think of was buying a tire (700 x\r\n16) for the left rear wheel, paying my overdue rent, Gootes' infuriating\r\nbuffoonery, the possibilities for a man of my caliber in Florida or New\r\nYork, and with a couple of thousand dollars a nice mailorder business\r\ncould be established to bring in a comfortable income....\r\n\r\nI left the chair and walked up and down the cramped room until the\r\nlodger below rapped spitefully on his ceiling. I went to the bathroom\r\nand washed my hands. I came back and inspected my teeth in the mirror.\r\nThen I resumed my seat and wrote, \"The Grass--\" After a moment I crossed\r\nthis out and substituted, \"Today, the grass--\"\r\n\r\nI decided the whole approach was unimaginative and unworthy of me. I\r\nturned the paper over and began, \"Like a dragon springing--\" Good,\r\ngood--this was the way to start; it would show the readers at once they\r\nwere dealing with a man of imagination. \"Like a dragon springing.\"\r\nSpringing from what? What did dragons spring from anyway? Eggs, like\r\nsnakes? Dragons were reptiles werent they? Or werent they? Give up the\r\nmetaphor? I set my teeth with determination and began again. \"Not unlike\r\na fierce and belligerently furious dragon or some other ferocious,\r\nblustery and furious chimerical creature, a menacing and comminatory\r\ndebacle is burning fierily in the heart of our fair and increasingly\r\npopulous city. As one with an innocent yet cardinal part in the\r\nunleashing of this dire menace, I want to describe how the exposure of\r\nthis threatening menace affected me as I looked upon its menacing and\r\nmalevolent advance today....\"\r\n\r\nI sat back, not dissatisfied with my beginning, and thought about the\r\nneat little bachelor apartment I could rent on what the _Intelligencer_\r\nwas paying me. Of course in a few days this hullabaloo would be all\r\nover--for though I had little faith in the efficacy of the crudeoil I\r\nknew really drastic measures would be taken soon and the whole business\r\nstopped--but even in so short a time there could be no doubt Mr Le\r\nffaçasé would realize he needed me permanently on his staff and I would\r\nbe assured of a living in my own proper sphere. Thus fired with the\r\nthoughts of accomplishment, I returned to my task, but I cannot say it\r\nwent easily. I remembered many great writers indulged in stimulants in\r\nthe throes of composition, but I decided such a course might blunt the\r\nkeen edge of my mind and afterall there was no better stimulant than\r\nplain oldfashioned perseverance. I picked up the pencil again and\r\ndoggedly went on to the next sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_16._ \"What the hell's this?\" demanded the cityeditor, looking at my\r\nneatly rolled pile of manuscript.\r\n\r\nI disdained to bandy words with an underling too lazy to make an effort\r\nto get at what was probably the finest piece of writing ever brought to\r\nhim, so I unrolled my story, flattening it out so he might read it the\r\nmore easily.\r\n\r\n\"By the balls of Benjamin Franklin and the little white fringe on Horace\r\nGreeley's chin, this goddamned thing's been wrote by hand! Arent there\r\nany typewriters anymore? Did Mister Remington commit suicide unbeknownst\r\nto me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I said stiffly. \"I didnt think youd have any difficulty in\r\nreading my handwriting.\" And in fact the whole business was absurd, for\r\nif there's anything I pride myself on it's the gracefulness and\r\nlegibility of my penmanship. Typewriters might well be mandatory for the\r\nephemeral news item, but I had been hired as a special correspondent and\r\nsomeday my manuscript would be a valuable property.\r\n\r\nThe cityeditor eyed me in a most disagreeable fashion. \"I'm an educated\r\nman,\" he stated. \"Groton, Harvard and the WPA. No doubt with time and\r\ncare I could decipher this bid for next year's Pulitzer prize. But I\r\nmust consider the more handicapped members of the staff: compositors,\r\nlayoutmen and proofreaders; without my advantages and broadmindedness\r\nthey might be so startled by this innovation as to have their usefulness\r\npermanently crippled. No; I'm afraid, Mr Weener, I must ask you to put\r\nthis in more orthodox form and type it up.\"\r\n\r\nJust another example of pettish bureaucracy, the officiousness of the\r\njack-in-office. Except for the nuisance, it didnt particularly matter.\r\nWhen Mr Le ffaçasé read my contribution I knew there would be no concern\r\nin future whether it was handwritten, typewritten, or engraved in\r\nBabylonic cuneiform on a freshly baked brick.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I went over to one of the unoccupied desks and began to\r\ncopy what I had written on the machine. I must say I was favorably\r\nimpressed by the appearance of my words in this form, for they somehow\r\nlooked more important and enduring. While still engaged in this task I\r\nwas slapped so heartily on the back I was knocked forward against the\r\ntypewriter and Gootes perched himself on a corner of the desk.\r\n\r\n\"Working the jolly old mill, what? I say, the old bugger wants to know\r\nwhere your stuff is. Fact of the matter, he wants to know with quite a\r\nbit of deuced bad language. Not a softspoken chap, you know, W R.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be through in a minute or two.\"\r\n\r\nHe gathered his pipe apparently out of my left ear and his tobacco pouch\r\nfrom the air and very rudely, without asking my permission, picked up\r\nthe top sheet and started to read it. A thick eyebrow shot up\r\nimmediately and he allowed his pipe to hang slackly from his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Purple,\" he exclaimed, \"magenta, violet, lavender, mauve. Schmaltz,\r\nreal copperriveted, brassbound, steeljacketed, castiron schmaltz. I\r\nhavent seen such a genuine sample since my kid sister wrote up Jack the\r\nRipper back in 1889.\"\r\n\r\nThe manifest discrepancy in these remarks so confused me my fingers\r\nstumbled over the typewriter keys. Evidently he intended some kind of\r\nhumor or sarcasm, but I could make nothing of it. How could his younger\r\nsister...?\r\n\r\n\"Bertie boy,\" he said, after I had struggled to get another paragraph\r\ndown, \"it breaks my heart to see you toil so. Let's take in as much as\r\nyouve done to the chief and either he'll be so impressed he'll put a\r\nstenographer to transcribing the rest or else--\"\r\n\r\n\"Or else?\" I prompted.\r\n\r\n\"Or else he won't. Come on.\"\r\n\r\nMr Le ffaçasé had apparently not stirred since last we were in his\r\noffice. He opened his eyes, thumbed a pinch of snuff and asked Gootes,\r\n\"Where the bloody hell is that stuff on the grass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, Chief. No date, no who what when and where, but very litry.\r\nVery, very litry.\"\r\n\r\nThe editor picked up my copy and I could not help but watch him\r\nanxiously for some sign of his reaction. It came forth promptly and\r\nexplosively.\r\n\r\n\"What the ingenious and delightfully painful hell is this, Gootes?\"\r\n\r\n\"'As Reported by Our Special Writer, Albert Weener, The Man Who\r\nInoculated the Loony Grass.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Gootes, you are the endproduct of a long line of incestuous idiots, the\r\nwinner of the boobyprize in any intelligencetest, but you have outdone\r\nyourself in bringing me this verminous and maggoty ordure,\" said Le\r\nffaçasé, throwing my efforts to the floor and kicking at them. The\r\noutrage made me boil and if he had not been an older man I might have\r\ndone him an injury. \"As for you, Weener, I doubt if you will ever be\r\nelevated to the ranks of idiocy. Get the sanguinary hell out of here\r\nand do humanity the favor to step in front of the first tentontruck\r\ndriving by.\"\r\n\r\n\"One minute, Chief,\" urged Gootes. \"Don't be hasty. Seen the latest on\r\nthe grass? Well, the mayor's asked the governor to call out the National\r\nGuard; the _Times_'ll have an interview with Einstein tomorrow and the\r\n_Examiner_'s going to run a symposium of what Herbert Hoover, Bernard\r\nShaw and General MacArthur think of the situation. Don't suppose perhaps\r\nwe could afford to ghost Bertie here?\"\r\n\r\nWas I never to escape from the malice inspired by the envy my literary\r\ntalent aroused? I had certainly expected that a man of the famous\r\neditor's reputation would be above such pettiness. I was too dismayed\r\nand downcast by the meanness of human nature to speak.\r\n\r\nLe ffaçasé snuffed again and looked malevolently at the wall. A framed\r\ncaricature of himself returned the stare. \"Very well,\" he grudgingly\r\nconceded at length, \"youre on the grass anyway, so you might as well\r\ntake this on too. Leave you only twentytwo hours a day to sleep in. You,\r\nWeener, are still on the payroll--at half the agreedupon figure.\"\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth to protest, but he turned on me with a snarl; baring\r\nyellow and twisted teeth, unpleasant to see. \"Weener, you look like a\r\ncriminal type to me; Lombroso couldve used you for a model to advantage.\r\nHave you a policerecord or have you so far evaded the law? Let me tell\r\nyou, the _Intelligencer_ is the evildoers' nemesis. Is your conscience\r\nclear, your past unsullied as a virgin's bed, your every deed open to\r\nsearch? Do you know what a penitentiary's like? Did you ever hear the\r\nclang of a celldoor as the turnkey slammed it behind him and left you to\r\nthink and stew and weep in a silence accented and made more wretched by\r\na yellow electricbulb and the stink of corrosivesublimate? Back to the\r\ncityroom, you dabbling booby, you precious simpleton, addlepated dunce,\r\nand be thankful my boundless generosity permits you to draw a weekly\r\npaycheck at all and doesnt condemn you to labor forever unrewarded in\r\nthe subterranean vaults where the old files are kept.\"\r\n\r\nFirst Miss Francis and now Le ffaçasé. Were all these great\r\nintelligences touched? Was the world piloted by unbalanced minds? It\r\nseemed incredible, impossible it should be so, but two such similar\r\nexperiences in so short a time apparently supported this gloomy view.\r\nHorrible, I thought as I preceded Gootes out of the maniac's office,\r\nunbelievably horrible.\r\n\r\n\"Son,\" advised Gootes, \"never argue with the chief. He has the makings\r\nof a firstclass apoplexy--I hope. You just keep squawking to the\r\nbookkeeping department and youll get further than coming up against the\r\nOld Man. Now let's go out and look at nature in the raw.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my copy,\" I protested.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that,\" he said airily, \"I'll run that off when we come back.\r\nDeadlines mean nothing to Jacson Gootes, the compositors' companion, the\r\nproofreaders' pardner, the layoutman's love. Come, Señor Veener, we take\r\nlook at el grasso grosso by the moonlight.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_17._ However, it was not moonlight illuminating the weird tumulus, but\r\nthe glare of a battery of searchlights, suggesting, as Gootes\r\nirreverently remarked, the opening of a new supermarket. During my\r\nabsence the National Guard had arrived and focused the great\r\nincandescent beams on the mound which now covered five houses and whose\r\nthreat had driven the inhabitants from as many more. The powdery blue\r\nlights gave the grass an uncanny yellowish look, as though it had been\r\nstricken by a disease.\r\n\r\nThe rays, directed low, were constantly being interrupted by the bodies\r\nof the militiamen hurrying back and forth to accomplish some definite\r\ntask. \"What goes on?\" inquired Gootes.\r\n\r\nThe officer addressed had two gleaming silver bars on his shoulder. He\r\nseemed very young and nervous. \"Sorry--no one allowed this far without\r\nspecial authorization.\"\r\n\r\n\"Working press.\" Gootes produced a reporter's badge from the captain's\r\nbars.\r\n\r\n\"Oh. Excuse me. Say, that was a sharp little stunt, Mr--\"\r\n\r\n\"Name of Jacson Gootes. _Intelligencer_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Eltwiss. How did you learn stuff like that?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him, for the name was somehow vaguely familiar. But to the\r\nbest of my knowledge I had never seen that smooth, boyish face before.\r\n\r\n\"Talent. Natural talent. What did you say all the shootin was about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting ready to tunnel under,\" answered the officer affably. \"Blow the\r\nthing skyhigh from the middle and get rid of it right now. Not going to\r\nlet any grass grow under our feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I read an article saying neither dynamite, TNT nor nitroglycerin\r\nwould be effective against the grass; might even do more harm than\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Writers.\" Captain Eltwiss dismissed literature without even resorting\r\nto an exclamationpoint. \"Writers.\" To underline his confidence the\r\nboneshaking chatter of pneumatic chisels began a syncopated rattle.\r\nMilitary directness would accomplish in one swift, decisive stroke at\r\nthe heart of things what civilian fumbling around the edges had failed\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nI looked with almost sentimental regret at the great conical heap. I had\r\nbrought it into being; in a few hours it would be gone and whatever fame\r\nits brief existence had given me would be gone with it.\r\n\r\nWith swift method the guardsmen started burrowing. In ordered relays,\r\nfresh workers replaced tired, and the pile of excavated dirt grew. Since\r\ntheir activity, except for its urgency and the strangeness of the\r\nsituation, didnt differ from labors observable any time a street was\r\nrepaired or a foundation laid, I saw no point in watching, hour after\r\nhour. I thought Gootes' persistence less a devotion to duty than the\r\nidle curiosity which makes grown men gape at a steamshovel.\r\n\r\nMy hints being lost on him, I ascertained the hour they expected to be\r\nfinished and went home. Excitement or no excitement, I saw no reason to\r\nabandon all routine. My forethought was proven when I returned refreshed\r\nin midmorning as the last shovelfuls of dirt came from the tunnel and\r\nthe explosive charges were hurried to their place.\r\n\r\nThere was reason for haste. While the tunneling had been going on, all\r\nthe grassfighting activity had ceased, for the militia had ordered\r\nweedburners, reapers, bulldozers and the rest off the scene. The weed,\r\nunhampered for the first time since Mrs Dinkman attacked it with her\r\nlawnmower, responded by growing and growing until more and more\r\nguardsmen had to be detached to the duty of keeping it back from the\r\nexcavation--by the very means they had scorned so recently. Even their\r\nmost frantic efforts could not prevent the grass from sending its most\r\nadvanced tendrils down into the gaping hole where the wires were being\r\nlaid to detonate the charge.\r\n\r\nThere was so much dashing to and fro, so many orders relayed, so many\r\ndispatches delivered that I thought I might have been witnessing an\r\noutofdate Civilwar play instead of a peacetime action of the California\r\nNational Guard. Captain Eltwiss--I kept wondering where I'd heard the\r\nname--was constantly being interrupted in what was apparently a very\r\nfriendly conversation with Gootes by the arrival of officiallooking\r\nenvelopes which he immediately stuffed into his pocket with every\r\nindication of vexation. \"Silly old fools,\" he muttered, each time the\r\nincident happened.\r\n\r\nQuick inspections made, plans checked, an order was rasped to clear the\r\nvicinity. Gootes' agonized protest that he had to report the occasion\r\nfor the _Intelligencer_'s readers was ignored. \"Can't start making\r\nexceptions,\" explained Captain Eltwiss. Everyone--workingpress, militia,\r\nsightseers and all, had to move back a couple of blocks where\r\nintervening trees and houses cut us off from any view of the green hill.\r\n\r\n\"This is terrible,\" exclaimed Gootes frantically. \"Tragic. Howll I live\r\nit down? Howm I going to face W R? Godlike wrath. 'What poolhall were\r\nyou dozing in, Gootes? Asleep on your bloody feet, ay, somnambulistic\r\noffspring of a threetoed sloth?' Wait all night for a story and then not\r\nget it, like the star legman on the Jackson Junior Highschool\r\n_Jive-Jitterbug_. I'll never be able to hold my head up again. Say\r\nsomething, say something, Weener--Ive _got_ to get this.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll be able to hear the explosion from here,\" I remarked to console\r\nhim, for his distress was genuine.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he groaned. \"Hear the explosion. Albert, Albert ... you have a\r\nfertile mind. Why didnt I hide myself before they told us to clear out?\r\nWhy didnt I get W R to hire a plane? Why didnt I foresee this and do any\r\nof a hundred things? A microphone and automatic moviecamera ... Goony\r\nGootes, they called him, the man who missed all bets.... A captive\r\nballoon, now.... Hay! What about a roof?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trees,\" I objected, with a mental picture of him bursting into the\r\nnearest house and demanding entrance to the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Bushwa. Zair's no tree in z' way of z' old box over zair--allons!\"\r\n\r\nIt wasnt till he had urged me inside and up a flight of stairs that I\r\nrealized the \"box\" was Miss Francis' apartmenthouse. It had been a\r\nlogical choice, since its height and ugliness distinguished it even from\r\nits unhandsome neighbors. Less than a week had gone by since I had come\r\nhere for the first time. As I followed Gootes' grasshopper leaps upward\r\nat a more dignified pace, I reflected how strangely my circumstances had\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nThe shoddily carpeted halls were musty and still as we climbed, except\r\nfor the unheeded squeaking of a radio someone had forgotten to turn off.\r\nYou could always tell when a radio was being listened to, for when\r\ndisregarded it sulkily gave off painfully listless noises in frustration\r\nand loneliness.\r\n\r\nI wasnt at all surprised to find Miss Francis among the spectators\r\ncrowded on the roof in evidence of having no more important occupation.\r\n\"I somehow expected you. Have you any new tricks?\" she asked Gootes\r\ncoaxingly.\r\n\r\n\"Ecod, your worship, wot time ave I for legerdemain? Wif your elp, now,\r\nI'd be a fine gentleman-journalist, stead of a noverworked ack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha,\" she said genially, busy with the toothpick, \"youll find enough\r\nrespectable laboratory mechanics eager to cooperate. How long will it be\r\nbefore they shoot, do you know?\"\r\n\r\nGootes shook his head and I strained my eyes toward the grass.\r\nSymmetrical and shimmeringly green, removed as it now was from all\r\nconnotations of danger by distance and the promise of immediate\r\ndestruction, it showed serenely beautiful and unaffected by the\r\nmachinations of its attackers. I could almost have wept as I traced its\r\nsloping sides upward to the rounded peak on top. Reversing all previous\r\nimpressions, it now appeared to be the natural inhabitant and all the\r\nhouses, roadways, pavements, fences, automobiles, lightpoles and the\r\nrest of the evidences of civilization the intruders.\r\n\r\nBut even as I looked at it so eagerly it moved and wavered and I heard\r\nthe muffled boom of explosion. The roof trembled and windows rattled\r\nwith diminishing echoes. The noise was neither a great nor terrifying\r\none and I distinctly remember thinking it quite inadequate to the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nI believe all of us there, when we heard the report, expected to see a\r\nvast hole where the grass had been. I'm sure I did. When it was clear\r\nthis hadnt happened, I continued to stare hard, thinking, since my\r\nhighschool physics was so hazy, I had somehow reversed the relative\r\nspeed of sight and sound and we had heard the noise before seeing the\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nBut the green bulk was still there.\r\n\r\nOh, not unchanged, by any means. The smooth, picturebook slope had\r\nbecome jagged and bruised while the regular, evenlyrounded apex had\r\nturned into a sort of phrygian cap with its pinnacle woundedly askew.\r\nThe outlines which had been sharp were now blurred, its evenness had\r\nbecome scraggly. The placid surface was vexed; the attempt on its being\r\nhad hurt. But not mortally, for even with outline altered, it remained;\r\ndefiant, certain, inexorable.\r\n\r\nThe air was filled with small green particles whirling and floating\r\ndownward. Feathery, yet clumsy, they refused to obey gravity and seek\r\nthe earth urgently, but instead shifted and changed direction, coyly\r\nspiraling upward and sideways before yielding to the inevitable\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\n\"At least there's less of it,\" observed Gootes. \"This much anyway,\" he\r\nadded, holding a broken stolon in his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"_Cynodon dactylon_,\" said Miss Francis, \"like most of the family\r\nGramineae, is propagated not only by seed, but by cuttings as well. That\r\nis to say, any part of the plant (except the leaves or flowers)\r\nseparated from the parent whole, upon receiving water and nourishment\r\nwill root itself and become a new parent or entity. The dispersion of\r\nthe mass, far from making the whole less, as our literary friend so\r\ningenuously assumes, increases it to what mathematicians call the _n_th\r\npower because each particle, finding a new restingplace unhampered by\r\nthe competition for food it encountered when integrated with the parent\r\nmass, now becomes capable of spreading infinitely itself unless checked\r\nby factors which deprive it of sustenance. These facts have been\r\nrepeated a hundred times in letters, telegrams and newspaper articles\r\nsince the project of attempting to blow up the inoculated batch was\r\nknown. In spite of warnings the authorities chose to go ahead. No, make\r\nno mistake, this fiasco has not set _Cynodon dactylon_ back a\r\nmillimeter; rather it has advanced it tremendously.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence while we absorbed this unpleasant bit of information.\r\nGootes was the first to regain his usual cockiness and he asked, \"You\r\nsay fiasco, professor. O K--can you tell us just why it was a fiasco? I\r\nknow they stuck enough soup under it to blow the whole works and when it\r\nwent off it gave out with a good bang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. _Cynodon dactylon_ spreads in what may be called jumps. That\r\nis, the stems are short and jointed. Those aboveground, the true stems,\r\nare called stolons, and those below, from which the roots spread, are\r\nrhizomes. Conceive if you will twoinch lengths of stiff wire--and this\r\nplant is vulgarly called wiregrass in some regions just as it is called\r\ndevilgrass here--bent on either end at rightangles. Now take these bits\r\nand weave them horizontally into a thick mass. Then add, vertically,\r\nmore of the wires, breaking the pattern occasionally and putting in more\r\nin odd places, just to be sure there are no logical fracturepoints.\r\nCover this involved web--not forgetting it has three dimensions despite\r\nmy instructions treating it as a plane--with earth, eight, ten, or\r\ntwelve inches deep. Then try to blow it up with dynamite or\r\ntrinitrotoluene and see if you havent--in a much lesser\r\ndegree--duplicated and accounted for the situation in hand.\"\r\n\r\nEverything now seemed unusually and, perhaps because of the contrast,\r\nunreasonably quiet. Downstairs the radio, which had been monotonously\r\nsoothing a presumptive audience of unsatisfied housewives with languid\r\nballads, raised its pitch several tones as though for the first time it\r\nhad become interested in what it purveyed.\r\n\r\n\"... Yes, unseen friends, God is preparing His vengeance for wickedness\r\nand sin, even as you are listening. You have been warned many times of\r\nthe wrath to come, but I say to you, the wrath is at hand. Even now God\r\nis giving you a sign of His displeasure; a cloud no bigger than a man's\r\nhand. But, O my unseen friends, that cloud has within it all the storms,\r\ncyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and tornadoes necessary to destroy you\r\nand yours. Unless you repent of your pride and sloth, Judgment will\r\nsurely come upon you. The Lord has taken a simple and despisèd weed and\r\ncaused it to multiply in defiance of all your puny powers and efforts. O\r\nmy friends, do not fight this grass, but cherish it; do not allow it to\r\nbe cut down for it is full of significance for you. Call off all your\r\nminions and repent, lest if the holy messenger be injured a more\r\nterrible one is sent. But now, my friends, I see my time is up; please\r\nsend your contributions so urgently needed to carry on the Divine Work\r\nto Brother Paul care of the station to which you are listening.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's one way of looking at it,\" said Gootes. \"Adios amigos.\"\r\n\r\nHe went down the stairs at an even more breakneck pace than he had come\r\nup. Almost in front of the apartmenthouse door we nearly collided with\r\ntwo officers in angry dispute.\r\n\r\n\"You mean to tell me, Captain, that not one of the urgent orders to\r\nsuspend operations came through to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Colonel, I havent seen a thing against the project except some fool\r\narticles in a newspaper.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly I remembered where I'd seen the name Eltwiss. It was on the\r\nfinancial page, not far away from the elusive quotation on Consolidated\r\nPemmican and Allied Concentrates for which I'd been idly searching.\r\n\"Eltwiss Explosives Cut Melon.\" Funny how things come back to you as\r\nsoon as you put them out of your mind.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis, who had followed us down was busy collecting some of the\r\nstolons which were still floating lazily downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_18._ An illiterate patchwork of lifeless and uninteresting scribbling\r\nappeared under my byline day after day in the _Intelligencer_. Not a\r\nword, not a thought of my own was left. I was not restrained from\r\nprotest by the absurd threats of Le ffaçasé, but prudence dictated not\r\nthrowing away dirty water before I got clean, and the money from the\r\npaper, while negligible of course, yet provided my most pressing needs.\r\n\r\nAs I was being paid for my name while my talents went to waste, I was\r\nfree to go anywhere I pleased, but I had little desire to leave the\r\nvicinity of the grass. It exerted upon me, more understandably, the same\r\nfascination as on the merely curious.\r\n\r\nBut I was not permitted unmolested access to the phenomenon with which I\r\nwas so closely concerned. An officious young guardsman warned me away\r\nbrusquely and I was not allowed to come near until I swallowed my pride\r\nand claimed connection with the _Intelligencer_. Even then it was\r\nnecessary for me to explain myself to several nervous soldiers on pain\r\nof being ordered from the spot.\r\n\r\nI was struck as I had not been before by the dynamic quality of the\r\ngrass; never the same for successive instants. Constant movement and\r\nstruggle as the expanding parts fought for room among themselves,\r\npushing upward and outward, seemed to indicate perceptible sentience\r\npermeating the whole body. Preparing, brooding, it was disturbed,\r\nsearching, alert.\r\n\r\nIts external aspect reflected the change. The proportions of height to\r\nbreadth had altered since the explosion. The peak had disappeared,\r\nflattening out into an irregular plateau. Its progress across the\r\nground, however, had been vastly accelerated; it had crossed the streets\r\non all sides of the block and was spreading with great rapidity over the\r\nwhole district. For the moment no new effort was apparently being made\r\nto halt its progress, the activities of the militia being confined to\r\npatrolling the area and shooing decent citizens away. I wondered if a\r\nnew strategy contemplated allowing the thing to exhaust itself. Since it\r\nlooked more vigorous with each passing hour, I saw myself on the payroll\r\nof the _Intelligencer_ for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nCaptain Eltwiss walked by and I asked him if this were so. \"Don't\r\nworry,\" he reassured me. \"We're hep now, with the actual, unbeatable\r\nmccoy. Park the body and watch what happens to old Mr Grass.\"\r\n\r\nI had every intention of staying and I thought it advisable to remain\r\nclose to the captain in order, if his boast were wellfounded, to be in\r\non the kill. He was in excellent spirits and although I did not think it\r\ntactful to refer to it, it was evident his little difference with the\r\ncolonel about the unreceived orders had not affected him. We chatted\r\namiably. I mentioned what Miss Francis had said about the weed springing\r\nup in new places from each of the shreds dispersed by the explosion, but\r\nhe merely shrugged and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I know these longbearded scientific nuts. They can find calamity around\r\nthe corner quicker than a drunk can find a bar.\"\r\n\r\n\"The discoverer of the Metamorphizer is a woman, so her long beard is\r\ndoubtful,\" I told him, just a little irritated by his cocksureness.\r\n\r\nHe laughed with as much ease at himself as at anything else. \"A woman\r\nscientist, ay? Funny things womenll do when they can't get a man. But\r\nlongbearded or flatchested it's all the same. Gruesome, that's what\r\nthey are, gruesome. Forget it. After we get this cleaned up we'll take\r\ncare of any others that start, but personally I don't think therell be\r\nany. Sounds like a lot of theory to me.\"\r\n\r\nI looked contemptuously at him, for he had that unimaginative approach\r\nwhich disdains Science and so holds Civilization back on its upward\r\npath. If the world's future rested with people like this, I thought, we\r\nshould never have had dynamite or germtheories or airplanes capable of\r\ndestroying whole cities at a blow.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Eltwiss was a servant to the Science he looked down on. The\r\nanswer he had bragged about now appeared and it was a scientific\r\ncontribution if ever there was one. A division of tanks, twenty or\r\nthirty of them with what appeared to be sledrunners invertedly attached\r\nto their fronts, rolled into sight. \"Wirecutters,\" he explained with\r\npride. \"Same equipment used for barbedwire on the Normandy beachhead. Go\r\nthrough anything like cheese.\"\r\n\r\nThe tanks drew up in a semicircle and the drivers came out of their\r\nvehicles for lastminute preparations. A final check was made of gas,\r\noil, and the positions of the wirecutters. Maps, showing the location of\r\neach house now covered by the grass, were studied and compasspoints\r\nchecked against them. I admired the thoroughness and efficiency of the\r\narrangements. So did the captain.\r\n\r\n\"The idea is simple. These tanks are shocktroops. Theyll cut their way\r\ninto the middle of the stuff. This will give us entranceways and a\r\ncentral operating point, besides hitting the grass where its strength is\r\ngreatest. From there--\" he paused impressively--\"from there we'll throw\r\neverything in the book at it and a few that arent. All the stuff they\r\nused before we came. Only we'll use it efficiently. And everything else.\r\nEven hush-hush stuff. Just got the release from Washington. The minute\r\none of these stems shows we'll stamp it out. We'll fight it and fight it\r\nuntil we beat it and we won't leave a bit of it, no, sir, not one bit of\r\nit, alive.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me triumphantly. Behind his triumph was a hint of the vast\r\nresources and the slowmoving but unassailable force his uniform\r\nrepresented. It sounded as though he had been correct in his boast and\r\nsomething drastic indeed would \"happen to Mr. Grass.\"\r\n\r\nThe tanks were ready to go at last and the drivers climbed back into\r\nthem and disappeared, leaving the steel monsters looking as though theyd\r\nswallowed the men. Like bubbles of air in a narrow glass tube they began\r\nto jerk backward and forward, until at some signal--I presume given by\r\nradio--they jumped ahead, their exhausts bellowing defiance of the grass\r\nmauled and torn by their treads.\r\n\r\nThey went onward with careless scorn, leaving behind a bruised and\r\ntrampled pathway. The captain followed in the track and I after him,\r\nthough I must admit it was not without some trepidation I put my feet\r\nupon the battered and now lifeless mass packed into a hard roadbed, for\r\nI recalled clearly how the grass had wrenched the ladder from the\r\nfiremen and how it had impishly attacked the broadcaster's equipment.\r\n\r\nThe tanks moved ahead steadily until the slope of the mound began to\r\nrise sharply and the runners of grass, instead of flattening obediently\r\nbehind, curled and twisted grotesquely as the tracks passed over them,\r\nlightly slapping at the impervious steel sides. Small bunches, mutilated\r\nand crushed, sprang back into erectness, larger ones flopped limply as\r\ntheir props were pushed aside.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, the tank we were trailing disappeared. There was no\r\nwarning; one second it was pursuing its way, an implacable executioner,\r\nthe next it had plunged into the weed and was lost to sight. The ends of\r\nthe grass came together spitefully behind it, weaving themselves\r\ntogether, knitting, as we watched, an opaque blanket. It closed over and\r\naround so that the smooth track ended abruptly, bitten by a wiry green\r\nportcullis.\r\n\r\nI was dismayed, but the captain seemed happy. \"Now we're getting\r\nsomewhere,\" he exclaimed. \"The little devils are eating right into the\r\nheart of the old sonofabitch.\"\r\n\r\nWe stood there gaping stupidly after our lost champion, but the grass\r\nmound was enigmatic and offered us no information as to its progress. A\r\nsurvey of the other tracks showed their tanks, too, had burrowed into\r\nthe heart of the weed like so many hounds after a rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the captain, who by now had apparently accepted me as his\r\nconfidant, \"let's go and see what's coming in over the radio.\"\r\n\r\nI was glad to be reminded the tanks werent lost, even temporarily, and\r\nthat we would soon learn of their advance. Field headquarters had been\r\nset up in a house about two blocks away and there, after exchanging\r\nsalutes, passwords, and assorted badinage, the captain led. The men in\r\ncontact with the tanks, shoulders hunched, fingers rapid with pad and\r\npencil, were sitting in a row by a wall on which had been tacked a large\r\nand detailed map of the district.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their earphones, a loudspeaker had also been thoughtfully\r\nset up, apparently to take care of any such curious visitors as\r\nourselves. The disadvantage, soon manifest, was that no plan had been\r\ndevised to unscramble the reports from the various tanks. As a\r\nconsequence, whenever two or three came in together, the reports\r\noverlapped, resulting in a jumble of unintelligible sounds from the\r\nloudspeaker.\r\n\r\n\"Brf brf brm,\" it was saying as we entered the room. \"Rrr rrr about\r\nthree hundred meters khorof khorof khorof north by northeast. Can you\r\nhear me, FHQ? Come in, FHQ.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a further muddle of words, then, \"I think my motor's going to\r\nconk out. Shall I backtrack, FHQ? Come in, FHQ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rugged place to stall,\" commented captain Eltwiss sympathetically, \"but\r\nwe can pull him out in halfashake soons we get things under control.\"\r\n\r\nThe loudspeaker, after a great deal of gibberish, condescended to\r\nclarity again. \"... about five hundred meters. Supposed to join SMT5 at\r\nthis point. Can't raise him by radio. What do you have on SMT5, FHQ?\r\nCome in, FHQ.\"\r\n\r\nI was still speculating as to what had happened to SMT5 when the\r\nloudspeaker once more became intelligible. \"... and the going's getting\r\ntougher all the time. I don't believe these goddamned wirecutters are\r\nworth a pissinasnowhole. Just fouled up, that's what they are, just\r\nfouled up. Got further if theyd been left off.\"\r\n\r\nHis grumbling was blotted out. For a moment there was complete babel,\r\nthen \"... if I can guess, it's somehow got in the motor and shorted the\r\nignition. Ive got to take a chance and get out to look at it. This is\r\nSMT3 reporting to FHQ. Now leaving the transmitter.\"\r\n\r\n\"... stalled so I turned on my lights. Can you hear me, FHQ? Come in\r\nFHQ, O K, O K, don't get sore. So I turned on my lights. I'm not going\r\nto do a Bob Trout, but I want to tell you it's pretty creepy. I guess\r\nthis stuff looks pretty and green enough on top, especially in daylight,\r\nbut from where I am now it's like an illustration out of Grimm's _Fairy\r\nTales_--something about the place where the wicked ogre lived. Not a bit\r\nof green. Not a bit of light except from my own which penetrate about\r\ntwo feet ahead and stop. Dead. Yellow and reddishbrown stems. Thick.\r\nInterlaced. How the hell I ever got this far I'd like to know. But not\r\nas much as how I'm going to get out.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sticking my head out of the turret now. As far as these stemsll let\r\nme. Which isnt far. Theyre a solid mass on top of the machine. And\r\nbeside it. I'm going to take a few tools and make for the engine. Only\r\nthing to do. Can't sit here and describe grassroots to you dogrobbers\r\nall day long. See if I can't get her running and back out. Then I resign\r\nfrom the state of California. Right then. This is SMT7 leaving the\r\ntransmitter for essential repairs and signing off.\"\r\n\r\nFor hours the reports kept coming in, all in identically the same vein:\r\nrapid progress followed by a slowdown, then either engine trouble or a\r\nfailure to keep rendezvous by another tank, all messages concluding\r\nalike: \"Now leaving transmitter.\" It was no use for field headquarters\r\nfrantically to order them to stay in their tanks no matter what\r\nhappened. They were young, ablebodied, impatient men and when something\r\nwent wrong they crawled out to fight their way through a few feet of\r\ngrass to fix it. Afterall they were in the heart of a great city. Their\r\nmachines had burrowed straightforwardly into the grass and no threats of\r\ncourtmartial could make them sit and look silly till help arrived and\r\nthey were tamely rescued. So one by one they wormed their way out to fix\r\nthe ignition, adjust the carburetor, or hack free the cogs which moved\r\nthe tracks. And one by one their radios became silent and were not heard\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe captain went from cockiness to doubt, from doubt to anxiety, and\r\nthen to anguished fury. He had been so completely confident of the\r\nmaneuver's outcome that its failure drove him, not to despair, but to\r\nanger. He knew most of the tankdrivers personally and the picture of\r\nthese friends trapped in their tiny, evernarrowing pockets of green sent\r\nhim into a frenzy. \"SMT1--that's Lew Brown. Don't get out, Lew--stay\r\nwhere you are, you jackass. Stay where you are, Lew,\" he bellowed into\r\nthe unresponsive loudspeaker.\r\n\r\n\"Jake White. Jake White's in four. Said I'd buy him a drink afterwards.\r\nJoke. He's a cocacola boy. Why can't you stay inside, Jake? Why can't\r\nyou stay put?\"\r\n\r\nUnable to bear it longer, he rushed from field headquarters shouting,\r\n\"Let's get'm out, boys, let's get'm out,\" and would personally have led\r\na volunteer party charging on foot into the grass if he had not been\r\nforcibly restrained and sympathetically led away, sobbing hysterically,\r\ntoward hospitalization and calming treatment.\r\n\r\nThe captain's impulse, though impractical, was shared by all his\r\ncomrades. For the moment the destruction of the grass became secondary\r\nto the rescue of the trapped tankmen. If field headquarters had bustled\r\nbefore, it now turned into a veritable beehive, with officers shouting,\r\nexhorting, complaining, and men running backwards and forwards as though\r\nthere were no specific for the situation except unlimited quantities of\r\ntheir own sweat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_19._ It would be futile to relate, even if I could recall them, all the\r\nvarious methods and devices which were suggested and rejected or tried\r\nand proved failures in the attempt to rescue the tankdrivers. Press and\r\nradio followed every daring essay and carefully planned endeavor until\r\nthe last vicarious quiver had been wrung from a fascinated public. For\r\ntwentyfour hours there was no room on the front pages of the newspapers\r\nfor anything but the latest on the \"prisoners of the grass,\" as they\r\nwere at first called. Later, when hope for their rescue had diminished\r\nand they were forced from the limelight to make way for later\r\ndevelopments, they were known simply as \"heroes in the fight against the\r\nweird enemy.\"\r\n\r\nFor the grass had not paused chivalrously during the interval. On the\r\ncontrary, it seemed to take renewed vigor from the victims it had\r\nentombed. House after house, block after block were engulfed. The names\r\nof those forced from their homes were no longer treated individually and\r\nwritten up as separate stories, but listed in alphabetical order, like\r\nbattle casualties. Miss Francis, frantically trying to get all her\r\nspecimens and equipment moved from her kitchen in time, had been ousted\r\nfrom the peeling stucco and joined those who were finding shelter (with\r\nsome difficulty) in other parts of the city.\r\n\r\nThe southernmost runners crept down toward Hollywood Boulevard where\r\nevery effort was being marshaled to combat them, and the northernmost\r\nwandered around and seemingly lost themselves in the desert of sagebrush\r\nand greasewood about Hollywood Bowl. Traffic through Cahuenga Pass, the\r\ngreat artery between Los Angeles and its tributary valley, was\r\nthreatened with disruption.\r\n\r\nBut while the parent body was spreading out, its offspring, as Miss\r\nFrancis foresaw, had come into existence. Dozens of nuclei were\r\nreported, some close at hand, others far away as the Sunset Strip and\r\nHollywoodland. These smaller bodies were vigorously attacked as soon as\r\ndiscovered but of course they had in every case made progress too great\r\nto be countered, for they were at first naturally indistinguishable\r\nfrom ordinary devilgrass and by the time their true character was\r\ndetermined so rapid was their growth they were already beyond all\r\npossibility of control.\r\n\r\nThe grass was now everyone's primary thought, replacing the moon (among\r\nlovers), the incometax (among individuals of importance), the weather\r\n(among strangers), and illness (among ladies no longer interested in the\r\nmoon), as topics of conversation. Old friends meeting casually after\r\nmany years' lapse greeted each other with \"What's the latest on the\r\ngrass?\" Radiocomedians fired gagmen with weeks of service behind them\r\nfor failure to provide botanical quips, or, conversely, hired raw\r\nwriters who had inhabited the fringes of Hollywood since Mack Sennett\r\ndays on the strength of a single agrostological illusion. Newspapers ran\r\nlong articles on _Cynodon dactylon_ and the editors of their garden\r\nsections were roused from the somnolence into which they had sunk upon\r\nreceiving their appointment and shoved into doubleleaded boldfaced\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nTextbooks on botany began outselling popular novels and a mere work of\r\nfiction having the accidental title _Greener Than You Think_ was\r\ncatapulted onto the bestseller list before anyone realized it wasnt an\r\nacademic discussion of the family Gramineae. Contributors to\r\nscientifiction magazines burst bloodvessels happily turning out ten\r\nthousand words a day describing their heroes' adventures amid the red\r\ngrass of Mars or the blue grass of Venus after they had\r\nsinglehanded--with the help of a deathray and the heroine's pure\r\nlove--conquered the green grass of Tellus.\r\n\r\nProfessors, shy and otherwise, were lured from their classrooms to\r\nlecture before ladies' clubs hitherto sacred to the accents of\r\ntransoceanic celebrities and Eleanor Roosevelt. There they competed on\r\nalternate forums with literate gardeners and stuttering horticultural\r\namateurs. Stolon, rhizome and culm became words replacing crankshaft and\r\npiston in the popular vocabulary; the puerile reports Gootes fabricated\r\nunder my name as the man responsible for the phenomenon were syndicated\r\nin newspapers from coast to coast, and a query as to rates was received\r\nfrom the _Daily Mail_.\r\n\r\nBrother Paul's exhortations on the radio increased in both length and\r\nintensity as the grass spread. Pastors of other churches and conductors\r\nof similar programs denounced him as misled; realestate operators,\r\nfearful of all this talk about the grass bringing doom and so\r\ndepreciating the value of their properties, complained to the Federal\r\nCommunications Commission; Sundayschools voted him the Man of the Year\r\nand hundreds of motherly ladies stored the studio with cakes baked by\r\ntheir own hands. Brother Paul's answer to indorser and detractor alike\r\nwas to buy up more radiotime.\r\n\r\nNo one doubted the government would at length awaken from its apathy and\r\ncounter the menace swiftly and efficiently, as always before in crises\r\nwhen the country was threatened. The nation with the highest rate of\r\nproduction per manhour, the greatest efficiency per machine, the\r\ngreatest wealth per capita, and the greatest vision per mindseye was not\r\ngoing to be defeated by a mere weed, however overgrown. While waiting\r\nthe inevitable action and equally inevitable solution the public had all\r\nthe excitement of war without suffering the accompanying privations and\r\nbereavements. The grass was a nuisance, but a nuisance with titillating\r\ncompensations; most people felt like children whose schoolhouse had\r\nburned down; they were sorry, they knew there'd be a new one, they were\r\nquite ready to help build it--but in the meantime it was fun.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Intelligencer_ was gorged with letters from its readers on\r\nthe subject of the grass. Many of them wanted to know what a newspaper\r\nof its standing meant by devoting so much space to an ephemeral\r\nhappening, while many more asked indignantly why more space wasnt given\r\nto something affecting their very lives and fortunes. Communist\r\npartymembers, using improbable pennames, asked passionately if this was\r\nnot a direct result of the country's failure to come to a thorough\r\nunderstanding with the Soviet Union? Terrified propertyholders irately\r\ndemanded that something, SOMETHING be done before realestate became as\r\nvalueless in Southern California as it already was in Red Russia.\r\n\r\nTechnocrats demanded the government be immediately turned over to a\r\ncommittee of engineers and competent agronomists who would deal with the\r\nsituation as it deserved after harnessing the wasted energy of the\r\npopulace. Nationalists hinted darkly that the whole thing was the result\r\nof a plot by the Elders of Zion and that Kaplan's Delicatessen--in\r\nconspiracy with A Cohen, Notions--was at the bottom of the grass.\r\nBrother Paul wrote--and his letter was printed, for he now advertised\r\nhis radioprograms in the columns of the _Intelligencer_--that\r\nCaesar--presumably the state of California--had been chastened for\r\narrogating to itself things not to be rendered unto Caesar and the\r\ntankmen had deservedly perished for their sacrilege. The letter aroused\r\nfury--the followers of Brother Paul either didnt read the _Intelligencer_\r\nor were satisfied their leader needed no championing, if they did--and\r\nother letters poured in calling for various expressions of popular\r\ndisapproval, from simple boycott up through tarring and feathering to\r\nplain and elaborated--with gasoline and castration--lynching. The grass\r\nwas a hot topic.\r\n\r\nWith its acute perception of the popular taste Le ffaçasé's paper\r\nprinted not only most of the communications--the unprintable ones were\r\ncirculated among the staff till they wore out or disappeared\r\nmysteriously in the Gents Room--but maps showing the daily progress of\r\nthe weed, guesses as to the duration of the plague by local prophets,\r\nlearned articles by scientists, opinions of statesmen, views of\r\nprominent entertainers, in fact anything having any remote connection\r\nwith the topic of the day. The paper even went further and offered a\r\nreward of ten thousand dollars to anyone advancing a suggestion leading\r\nto the destruction of the intruder. Its circulation jumped at the\r\nexpense of less perspicacious rivals and the incoming mail, already many\r\ntimes normal, swelled to staggering proportions.\r\n\r\nThe contest was taken with deadly seriousness, for the livelihood of\r\nmany of the paper's readers was suddenly threatened by its subject and\r\nfrom a new quarter. In the same issue as the offered reward there\r\nappeared an interview with the accredited head of the organized\r\nmotionpicture producers. This retiring gentleman was rumored to be\r\ncompletely illiterate, an unquestionable slander, for he had written\r\nchecks to support every cause dedicated to keeping wages where they\r\nbelonged and seeing the wage earners didnt waste the money so\r\nbenevolently supplied by their employers.\r\n\r\nI got the details of the interview from the interviewer himself. The\r\nmagnate--he had no objection to the description--had been irritable and\r\nminced no words. The grass was bad alike for production and boxoffice,\r\ntaking everyone's mind off the prime business of making and viewing\r\nmotionpictures. It was injuring The Industry and he couldnt conceal the\r\nfact that The Industry, speaking through his mouth and with his\r\nvocabulary, was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"Unless this disgraceful episode ends within ten days,\" he had said\r\nsternly, \"the Motion Picture Industry will move to Florida.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an ultimatum; Southern Californians heard and trembled. The last\r\ntime this dread interdiction had been invoked--in the midst of a bitter\r\nelection fight--it had sent them scurrying to the polls to do their\r\nbenefactor's bidding. Now indeed the grass menace would be taken\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nThe next day's paper had news of more immediate concern to me. The\r\ngovernor had appointed a special committee to investigate the situation\r\nand the first two witnesses to be called were Josephine Spencer Francis\r\nand Albert Weener.\r\n\r\n\r\n_20._ William Rufus Le ffaçasé was as enthusiastic as his phlegmatic\r\nnature permitted. He called me into his office and half raised the\r\nsnuffbox off the desk as though to offer me an unwelcome pinch. \"Youre a\r\nmade man now, Weener,\" he said, thinking better of his generosity and\r\nputting the snuffbox back. \"Your name will be in headlines from Alabama\r\nto Alberta--and all due to the _Intelligencer_.\"\r\n\r\nI would have resented this as a gross misappropriation of credit--for\r\nsurely all obligation was on the other side--had I not been deeply\r\ndisturbed by the prospect of being haled before this committee like a\r\ncriminal before the bar of justice.\r\n\r\n\"I'd much rather avoid this unpleasant notoriety, Mr. Le ffaçasé,\" I\r\nprotested. \"Since the _Intelligencer_, for reasons best known to itself,\r\nchooses not to avail itself of my contributions, but prints my name over\r\nwords I have not written, there could be no possible objection to my\r\nslipping away to Nevada until this investigation ends.\"\r\n\r\nHis face became a pretty shade of plum. \"Weener, youre a thief, a petty,\r\ncadging, sly, larcenous, pilfering, bloody thief. You take the _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_'s honest dollars without a qualm, aye, with a smirk on\r\nyour imbecile face, proposing with the cool impudence of the born\r\nembezzler to return no value for them. Weener, you forget yourself. The\r\n_Intelligencer_ picked you out of a gutter, a nauseous, dungspattered\r\nand thoroughly fitting gutter, and pays you well, mark that, you\r\nfeebleminded counterfeit of a confidenceman, pays you well, not for your\r\nfutile, lecherous pawings at the chastity of the English language, but\r\nout of the boundless generosity which only a newspaper with a great soul\r\ncan have. And what do you propose to do in gratitude? To run, to flee,\r\nto hide from the expression of authority, to bring disgrace upon the\r\nvery newspaper whose munificence pumps life into your boneless,\r\nsoulless, gutless carcass. Not another word, not a sound, not a ghoulish\r\nsyllable from your ineffective vocabulary. Out of my presence before I\r\nlose my temper. Get down to whatever smokefilled and tastelessly\r\ndecorated room that committee is meeting in and do not leave while it is\r\nin session, neither to eat, sleep, nor move those bowels whose\r\npossession I gravely doubt. You hear me, Weener?\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason the committee was not attempting to get the story of the\r\ngrass in chronological order. When I arrived, the six distinguished\r\ngentlemen were trying to find out all about the crudeoil poured,\r\napparently without effect, in what now seemed so long ago, but which\r\nactually had been less than two weeks before.\r\n\r\nFlanked on either side by his colleagues, the little black plug of his\r\nhearingaid sticking out like a misplaced unicorn's horn, was the\r\nchairman, Senator Jones, his looseskinned old fingers resting lightly on\r\nthe bright table, the nails square and ridged, the flesh brownspotted.\r\nHe adjusted a pair of goldrimmed spectacles, quickly found the\r\nimprovement in his vision unpleasant, and rumbled, \"What did it cost the\r\ntaxpayers?\"\r\n\r\nOn the stand, the chief of police was settled in great discomfort, so\r\nfar forward on the rounded edge of his chair that his balance was a\r\nsource of fascinated speculation to the gallery. He squirmed a perilous\r\nhalf inch forward, but before he had time to reply, old Judge Robinson\r\nof the State Supreme Court, who scorned any palliation of his deafness\r\nsuch as Senator Jones condescended to, cupped his left ear with his hand\r\nand shrieked, \"Ay? Ay? What's that? Speak up, can't you? Don't sit there\r\nmumbling.\"\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Brown, head of the legislature's antiracketeering committee,\r\nintense concentration expressed in the forward push of his vigorous\r\nshoulders and the creased lines on his youthful forehead, asked if it\r\nwere not true that the oil had been held up by a union jurisdictional\r\ndispute? There was a spattering of applause from the listeners at this\r\nadroit question and one man in the back of the room cried \"Sha--\" and\r\nthen sat down quickly.\r\n\r\nAttorney General Smith wanted to know just who had ordered the oil in\r\nthe first place and whether the propertyowners had given their consent\r\nto its application. The attorney general's square face, softened and\r\nrounded by fat, shone on the wriggling chief like a klieglight; his\r\nlips, irresistibly suggesting twin slices of underdone steak, parting\r\ninto a pleasant smile when his question had concluded. The other two\r\nmembers of the committee seemed about to inquire further when the chief\r\nmanaged to stammer, he was awfully sorry, gentlemen, but he had been\r\nout of town and hadnt even heard of the oil till this moment.\r\n\r\nHe was instantly dismissed from the stand and a new witness, from the\r\nmayor's office, was called, with no happier results. He, too, was about\r\nto be excused when Dr Johnson, who represented Science on the committee,\r\ndescended from Himalayan abstraction to demand what effect the oil had\r\nhad on the grass.\r\n\r\nThere were excited whisperings and craning of feminine heads as Dr\r\nJohnson propounded his question. The interest he excited was, however,\r\nlargely vicarious. For he was famous, not so much in his own right, as\r\nin being the husband of the _Intelligencer_'s widely read society\r\ncolumnist whose malapropisms caused more wry enjoyment and fearsome\r\nanticipation than an elopement to Nevada.\r\n\r\n\"And what effect did the oil have on the grass?\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nThe query caused confusion, for it seemed the committee could not\r\nproceed until this fact had been ascertained. Various technicians were\r\nsent for, and the doctor, tall, solemn and benign, looked over his\r\nstiff, turned-down collar and the black string tie drooping around it,\r\nas though searching for some profound truth which would be readily\r\napparent to him alone.\r\n\r\nThe experts discoursed at some length in esoteric terms--one even\r\nbringing a portable blackboard on which he demonstrated, with diagrams,\r\nthe chemical, geologic and mathematical aspects of the problem--but no\r\npertinent information was forthcoming till some minor clerk in the\r\nDepartment of Water and Power, who had only got to the stand through a\r\nconfusion of names, said boldly, \"No effect whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Judge Robinson. \"Was the oil adulterated? Speak up,\r\nspeak up; don't mumble.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Miller, the Southland's bestknown realtor (\"Los Angeles First in\r\nPopulation by Nineteen Ninety Nine\"), who had connections in the oil\r\nindustry, as well as in citrus and walnut packing, frowned\r\ndisapprovingly. The clerk said he didnt know, but he might venture a\r\nguess--\r\n\r\nSenator Jones informed him majestically that the committee was concerned\r\nwith facts, not speculations. This created an impasse until Attorney\r\nGeneral Smith tactfully suggested the clerk might be permitted to guess,\r\nentirely off the record. After the official stenographer had been\r\ncommanded sternly not to take down a single word of conjecture, the\r\nwitness was allowed to advance the opinion that the oil hadnt killed the\r\nplant because it had never reached the roots.\r\n\r\n\"Ay?\" questioned the learned judge, looking as though neither his lunch\r\nnor breakfast nor, for that matter, any nourishment absorbed since the\r\nTaft administration, had agreed with him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a bit of a gardener myself, gentlemen,\" the witness assured them\r\nconfidentially, settling back comfortably. \"I putter around my own place\r\nSaturdays and Sundays and I know what devilgrass is like. I can well\r\nimagine a bunch of it twenty or twentyfive feet high could be coated\r\nwith many, many gallons of oil without a drop seeping down into the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nMr Miller said magisterially, \"Not really good American oil,\" but no one\r\npaid attention, knowing that he was commenting, not as a member of the\r\ncommittee, but in his other capacity as the head of an organization to\r\npromote Brotherhood and Democracy by deporting all foreignborn and the\r\ndescendants of foreignborn to their original countries. Everyone was\r\nonly too happy to have the oil matter concluded at any cost; and after\r\nthe stenographer was ordered to resume his labors, the next witness was\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n\"Albert Weener!\"\r\n\r\nI hope I may never again have to submit to the scrutiny of twelve such\r\nmerciless eyes. I cast my own down at the brown linoleum until every\r\nstain and inkspot was impressed ineradicably on my mind. Senator Jones\r\nfinally broke the tension by asking, \"What is your name?\"\r\n\r\nJudge Robinson enjoined, \"Speak up, speak up. Don't mumble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert Weener,\" I replied.\r\n\r\nThere was a faint sigh through the room. Everyone who read the _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_ had heard of me.\r\n\r\n\"And what is your occupation, Mr Weener?\" asked Henry Miller.\r\n\r\n\"Salesman, sir,\" I answered automatically, forgetting my present\r\nconnection with the newspaper, and he smiled at me sympathetically.\r\n\r\n\"You belong to a socalled tradesunion?\" inquired Assemblyman Brown.\r\n\r\n\"I will ask the honorable Mr Brown to modify his question by having the\r\nword 'socalled' struck from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will inform the honorable attorney general that my question stands\r\nexactly as I phrased it,\" rejoined Assemblyman Brown sharply. \"I'll\r\nremind the attorney general I myself am a member in good standing of a\r\nlegitimate union, namely the International Brotherhood of Embalmers,\r\nMorticians, Gravediggers and Helpers, and when I asked the witness if he\r\nbelonged to a socalled tradesunion I was referring to any one of those\r\ngroups of Red conspirators who attempt to strangle the economic body by\r\ninterfering with the normal course of business and mulcting honest\r\ncitizens of tributary dues before they can pursue their livelihoods.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Robinson cupped his ear again and glared at me. \"Speak up man;\r\nstop mumbling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't belong to any union,\" I answered as soon as there was a chance\r\nfor my words to be heard. Senator Jones took a notebook from his pocket,\r\nconsulted it, put it back, scribbled something on the pad in front of\r\nhim, tore it up, looked at his notebook again and asked, \"What is your\r\nconnection with this ... um ... grass?\"\r\n\r\n\"I applied Miss Francis' Metamorphizer to it, sir,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Judge Robinson sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Explain yourself,\" demanded Attorney General Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us just what this stuff is and how you applied it,\" suggested\r\nHenry Miller.\r\n\r\n\"Don't mumble,\" ordered Judge Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, gentlemen, I don't know exactly what it is. Youll have to\r\nask Miss Francis that. But--\"\r\n\r\nSenator Jones interrupted me. \"You mean to say you applied a chemical to\r\nsomeone's lawn, a piece of valuable property, without knowing its\r\ncontents?\" he asked sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Senator----\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"Do you habitually act in this irresponsible manner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senator, I----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you understand, sir, that consequences necessarily follow\r\nactions? What sort of world would this be if everyone rushed around\r\nblindly using things of whose nature they were completely unaware?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mumble,\" warned Judge Robinson.\r\n\r\nI began to feel very low indeed and could only say haltingly, \"I acted\r\nin good faith, gentlemen,\" when Mr Miller kindly recommended that I be\r\nexcused since I had evidently given all the information at my command.\r\n\r\n\"Subject to recall,\" growled Attorney General Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, certainly, sir, certainly,\" agreed Mr Miller, and I was thankfully\r\nreleased from my ordeal.\r\n\r\n\"Josephine Spencer Francis.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot say Miss Francis had made any concessions in her appearance in\r\ndeference to the committee, for she looked as though she had come\r\nstraight from her kitchen, a suspicion strengthened by the strand of\r\ngrass she carried in her fingers and played with absently throughout.\r\nShe appeared quite at home as she settled herself in the chair, scanning\r\nwith the greatest interest the faces of the committeemen as if she were\r\nmemorizing each feature for future reference.\r\n\r\nThe honorable body returned her scrutiny with sharply individual\r\nemphasis. The attorney general smiled pleasantly at her; Judge Robinson\r\nlooked more sour than ever and grunted, \"Woman; mistake\"; Senator Jones\r\nbowed toward her with courtesy; Assemblyman Brown gave her a sharp\r\nonceover; Mr Miller pursed his lips in amusement; and Dr Johnson gazed\r\nat her in horrified fascination.\r\n\r\nSenator Jones bowed for a second time and inquired her name. He\r\nreceived the information and chewed it meditatively. Miss Francis took\r\nout her gold toothpick, considered the etiquette of using it and\r\nregretfully put it away in time to hear the attorney general's question,\r\n\"Mrs or Miss Francis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss,\" she replied gruffly. \"_Virgo intacta._\"\r\n\r\nSenator Jones drew back as if attacked by a wasp. Attorney General Smith\r\nsaid, \"Hum,\" very loudly and looked at Assemblyman Brown who looked\r\nblank. Dr Johnson's nose raised itself a perceptible inch and Judge\r\nRobinson, sensing a sensation among his colleagues, shouted, \"Speak up,\r\nmadam, don't mumble.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Miller, who hadnt been affected, inquired, \"What is your occupation,\r\nMiss Francis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agrostological engineer, specializing in chemical research.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that again?\" Judge Robinson managed to put into the simple\r\ngesture of cupping his ear a devastating condemnation of Miss Francis,\r\nwomen in general, science and presentday society. She politely repeated\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"Astrology--what's that got to do with the grass? Do you cast\r\nhoroscopes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Agrostology,\" Dr Johnson murmured to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"Will you explain please in simpler terms, just what you do?\" requested\r\nAttorney General Smith.\r\n\r\n\"Local statutes against fortunetelling,\" burst out Judge Robinson.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent my life studying reactions of plants to the lighter\r\nelements and the effects of certain compounds on their growth,\r\nreproduction, and metabolism.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Robinson removed his hand from behind his ear and rubbed his skull\r\nirritably. Assemblyman Brown complained, \"There's entirely too much talk\r\nabout reaction.\" Dr Johnson inspected a paneled wall with no interest\r\nwhatever and Senator Jones stated pontifically, \"You are an agricultural\r\nchemist.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Francis smiled at him amiably. \"Agriculture is a broad field and I\r\nfarm one small corner of it.\"\r\n\r\nAttorney General Smith leaned forward with interest. \"From what\r\nuniversity did you obtain your degrees, Miss Francis?\"\r\n\r\nShe slouched back comfortably, to look more cylindrical than ever.\r\n\"None,\" she stated baldly.\r\n\r\n\"Hay? ... mumble!\"\r\n\r\nSenator Jones said, \"I'm afraid I did not quite understand your reply,\r\nmadam.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hold no degrees, honors, or diplomas whatever, and I have not wasted\r\none second of my life in any college, university, academy, or other\r\nalleged institution of learning. The degrees good enough for Roger\r\nBacon, Erasmus Darwin, Lavoisier, Linnaeus and Lamarck are good enough\r\nfor me. I am a questioner, gentlemen, a learner, not a collector of\r\nalphabetical letters which, strung together in any form your fancy\r\npleases, continue eternally to spell nothing whatever.\"\r\n\r\nSensation. One of the experts who had been waiting patiently to testify,\r\nfolded his arms and said in a loud voice, \"This is what comes of\r\ntolerating women in the professions.\" Another muttered, \"Charlatan ...\r\nridiculous ... dangerous thing ... shameful ... sex ...\" Two elderly\r\nladies in broadcloth coats with fur collars, later identified as\r\ncrusaders for antivivisection, cheered feebly and were promptly ejected.\r\n\r\nSenator Jones took off his spectacles, polished them exhaustively, tried\r\nto put them on upside down, gave up and stated gravely, \"This is an\r\nextraordinary admission, Miss, um, Francis.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not an admission at all; it is a statement of fact. As for its\r\nirregularity, I take the liberty of believing we unlettered ones are in\r\nthe majority rather than minority.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Robinson warned, \"Could be cited for contempt, Miss Harrumph.\"\r\n\r\nDr Johnson said sharply, \"Nonsense, madam, even a--even a tree surgeon\r\nhas more respect for learning.\"\r\n\r\nMr Miller leaned slightly over the table. \"Do you realize that in your\r\nignorant dabbling you have ruined hundreds of propertyowners and\r\ntaxpayers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought there was some law against practicing without a license,\"\r\nspeculated Assemblyman Brown.\r\n\r\n\"There is apparently no law applying intelligence qualifications for\r\nmembers of the legislature,\" remarked Miss Francis pleasantly.\r\n\r\nSenator Jones lifted his gavel, idle until now, and banged it on the\r\ntable, smashing his spectacles thoughtlessly placed in front of him a\r\nmoment before. This did nothing to appease his rising choler. \"Silence,\r\nmadam! We have perhaps been too lenient in deference to your, um, sex.\r\nI'll remind you that this body is vested with all the dignity of the\r\nstate of California. Unless you apologize instantly I shall cite you for\r\ncontempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg the committee's pardon.\"\r\n\r\nThe investigators held a whispered conference among themselves,\r\nevidently to determine whether this equivocal apology was to be\r\naccepted. Apparently it was, for Dr Johnson now asked loftily and with\r\nan abstracted air, as though he already knew the answer and considered\r\nit beneath notice, \"What was this magic formula you caused to be put on\r\nthe grass?\"\r\n\r\nMalicious spirits averred that Dickie Johnson had flunked out of\r\nagricultural school, had an obscure European diploma, and that his fame\r\nas a professor at Creighton University was based on the gleaming granite\r\nand stainless steel building dedicated to research in agronomy which\r\nbore the legend \"Johnson Foundation\" over the entrance. No one hearing\r\nhim pronounce \"magic formula\" putting into the word all the contempt of\r\nthe scientist for the quack, could ever put credence in the base\r\nslander. \"What was this 'magic formula' you caused to be put on the\r\ngrass?\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis reeled off a list of elements so swiftly I'm sure no one\r\nbut the stenographer caught them all. I know I didnt get more than half,\r\nthough I was sitting less than five feet from her. \"Magnesium,\" she\r\nstated, \"iodine, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, potash, sulphur,\r\noxygen ...\"\r\n\r\nDr Johnson seemed to have known its composition since grammarschool\r\ndays. Senator Jones asked, \"And what effect did you expect this\r\nextraordinary conglomeration to have?\"\r\n\r\nShe repeated what she had told me at first and the deductions she had\r\nmade since. Dr Johnson smiled. \"A true Man of Science,\" he stated, \"one\r\nwho has labored for years to acquire those degrees you affect to\r\ndespise, would have been trained in selfless devotion to the service of\r\nmankind, would never have made whatever gross error your ignorance,\r\nheightened by projection into a sphere for which you are probably\r\nbiologically unfitted--though this is perhaps controversial--has\r\nbetrayed you into. For had you freely shared your work with colleagues\r\nthey would have been able to correct your mistakes and this catastrophe\r\nbrought on by selfish greed--a catastrophe which has already cost\r\nmillions--would not have occurred.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire committee, including Dr Johnson himself, seemed pleased with\r\nthis indictment. Attorney General Smith looked inquiringly at the\r\nwitness as though inviting her to answer _that_ if she could. Miss\r\nFrancis evidently took the invitation literally, for she addressed\r\nherself directly to Dr Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, Doctor, where these beautiful and eminently sensible\r\nideals you have so eloquently outlined are practiced, where scientists,\r\nregardless of biological fitness, share with each other their advances\r\nfrom moment to moment and so add to the security of civilization from\r\nday to day. Is it in the great research foundations whose unlimited\r\nfunds are used to lure promising young men to their staffs, much as\r\nathletes used to be given scholarships by universities anxious to\r\nimprove the physical qualities of American youth? Is it in the\r\nexperimental laboratories of great industries where technological\r\nadvances are daily suppressed, locked away in safes, so profits may not\r\nbe diminished by the expensive retooling necessary to put these advances\r\ninto effect? Or is it in a field closer to my own, in chemical\r\nresearch--pure science, if you like--where truly secrets are shared on\r\nan international scale in order to build up the cartels which choke\r\nproduction by increasing prices and promote those industries which\r\nthrive on international illwill?\"\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Brown rose to his feet and said in measured tones, \"This\r\nwoman is a paid agent of the Communist International. I have heard such\r\nrantings from demagogues on streetcorners. I demand the committee listen\r\nto no more of this propaganda.\"\r\n\r\nMr Miller gave a polite wave of his hand toward the assemblyman,\r\nindicating at once full agreement with what the legislator said and\r\napology for pursuing his questioning of Miss Francis. He then asked the\r\nwitness sternly, \"What is your real name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't quite understand. The only name I have is Josephine\r\nSpencer Francis and so far as I know it is thus written on my birth\r\ncertificate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Birth certificate, ay? Where were you born? Speak up, don't mumble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Russia, without a doubt,\" muttered Assemblyman Brown.\r\n\r\n\"Youre sure it isnt Franciski or Franciscovitch? Or say, Finklestein?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is not Finkelstein, although I do not find myself terrified of\r\nthat combination of syllables. I was born in Moscow--\"\r\n\r\nAnother sensation. \"I thought so!\" screamed Judge Robinson triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" exclaimed Senator Jones profoundly.\r\n\r\n\"The leopard doesnt change his spots or the Red his (or her) color,\"\r\nasserted Assemblyman Brown.\r\n\r\n\"A sabatoor,\" yelled several of the spectators. Only Dr Johnson seemed\r\nunimpressed with the revelation; he smiled contentedly.\r\n\r\n\"--in Moscow, Idaho,\" concluded Miss Francis, picking her teeth with a\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nJudge Robinson screeched, \"Ay? Ay? What's all this hubbub?\" Assemblyman\r\nBrown sneered, \"A very unlikely story.\" Attorney General Smith wanted it\r\nproven in blackandwhite while Senator Jones remarked Miss Francis' taste\r\nwas on a level with her scholarship.\r\n\r\nShe waved the toothpick toward the chairman and politely waited for\r\neither further questions or dismissal. All the while her intense\r\ninterest in each gesture of the inquisitors and every facet of the\r\ninvestigation had not diminished at all. As she sat there patiently, her\r\neyes darted from one to the other as they consulted and only came to\r\nrest on Senator Jones when he spoke directly to her again.\r\n\r\n\"And what steps can you take to undo, hum, this?\"\r\n\r\n\"So far, none,\" admitted Miss Francis, \"but since this thing has\r\nhappened I have given all my time to experiment hoping in some manner to\r\nreverse the action of the Metamorphizer and evolve a formula whereby the\r\ngrowth it induced will be inhibited. I cannot say I am even on the right\r\nroad yet, for you must recall I have spent my adult life going, as it\r\nwere, in one direction and it is now not a matter of merely retracing my\r\nsteps, but of starting out for an entirely different destination in a\r\nfield where there are no highwaymaps and few compasspoints. I cannot say\r\nI am even optimistic of success, but it is not for want of trying--be\r\nassured of that.\"\r\n\r\nAnother semisilence while the committee conferred once more. Finally\r\nSenator Jones spoke in grave and measured tones: \"It is a customary\r\npoliteness in hearings of this nature to thank the witness for his\r\nhelpfulness and cooperation. This courtesy I cannot with any sincerity\r\nextend to you, madam. It seems to me you have proven yourself the\r\nopposite of a good citizen, that you have set yourself up, in your\r\narrogance, against all logical authority and have presumed to look down\r\nupon the work and methods of men whose standing and ways of procedure\r\nare recognized by all sound people. By your conceit, madam, you have\r\ncaused the death of young men, the flower of our state's manhood, who\r\ngave their lives in a vain attempt to destroy what your ignorance\r\ncreated. If I may be permitted a rather daring and perhaps harsh aside,\r\nI think this should strike you doubly, as a woman who has not brought\r\nforth offspring to carry on the work of our forefathers and as one\r\nwho--with doubtful taste--boasts of that sterility. I think the results\r\nof your socalled experiments should chasten you and make you heed the\r\nwords of men properly qualified in a field where you are clearly not\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nSomeone in the back of the room applauded the senator's eloquence.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Jones,\" said Miss Francis, turning her eyes on him with the\r\nattention I knew so well, the look which meant she had found an interest\r\nfor the moment excluding all others, \"you accuse me of what amounts to\r\ncrime or at least criminal folly and I must answer that your accusations\r\nare at once both true and false. I have been foolish, but it was not in\r\ndespising the constrictions and falsity of the academic world. I _have_\r\nflouted authority, but it was not the authority of the movingpicture\r\nheroes, whose comic errors are perpetuated for generations, like those\r\nof Pasteur, or so quietly repudiated their repudiation passes unnoticed,\r\nlike those of Lister, in order to protect a vested interest. The\r\nauthority I have flouted, in my arrogance as you call it, is that\r\nauthority all scientists recognized in the days when science was\r\nscientific and called itself, not boastfully by the name of all\r\nknowledge, but more humbly and decently, natural philosophy. That\r\nauthority is what theologians term the Will of God; others, the life\r\nforce, the immaterial principle, the common unconscious, or whatever you\r\nwill. When I, along with all the academic robots whom you admire, denied\r\nthat authority, we did not make ourselves, as we thought, men of pure\r\nscience, but, on the contrary, by deposing one master we invited in a\r\nhorde of others. Since we could not submit to moral force we submitted\r\nin our blind stupidity--we called it the rejection of metaphysical\r\nconcepts--to financial force, to political force, to social force; and\r\nfinally, since there was no longer any reward in itself for our\r\nspeculations, we submitted to the lust for personal aggrandizement in\r\nfortune, in notoriety, in castebound irresponsibility, and even for the\r\nhypocritical backslapping of our fellows.\r\n\r\n\"In the counterrevolution known as the nineteenth century we even\r\nrepudiated the name of speculation and it became a term of disrepute,\r\nlike metaphysical. We went further than a mere disavowal of the name; we\r\ndisavowed the whole process and turned with disgust from the using of\r\nour minds to the use of our hands in a manner which would have revolted\r\nthe most illiterate of Carpathian peasants. We extirpated the salivary\r\nglands of dogs in order to find out if they would slobber without them.\r\nWe cut off the tails of mice to discover if the operation affected their\r\ngreatgrandchildren. We decapitated, emasculated, malnourished, and\r\npoisoned rodents against whom we had no personal animus for no other\r\nreason than to keep an elaborate apparatus in use.\r\n\r\n\"Even these pastimes failed to satisfy our undiscriminating appetite.\r\nSomeone a little stupider, a little less imaginative--though such\r\nconditions must have been difficult indeed to achieve--invented what is\r\ncalled the Control Experiment whereby, if theory tested be correct, half\r\nthe subjects are condemned without trial to execution.\r\n\r\n\"These are my sins: that in despising academic ends I did not despise\r\nacademic means, that in repudiating the brainlessness of the\r\nprofessorial mind I did not attempt to use my own. Because I was proud\r\nof the integrity which made me choose not to do the will of a research\r\nfoundation or industrial empire, I overlooked the vital fact that I had\r\nalso chosen not to do God's Will, but what I stupidly thought to be my\r\nown. It was not. It was faintheartedness, sloth, placation, doubt,\r\nvagueness and romantical misconception. In a word, it was the\r\naimlessness and falsity of the nineteenth century coming back in the\r\nwindow after having been booted out the door; my folly was the failure\r\nto recognize it. I have deluded myself, I have taken halfmeasures, I\r\nhave followed false paths. Condemn me for these crimes. I am guilty.\"\r\n\r\nAttorney General Smith said acidly, \"This is neither a psychiatrist's\r\nconsulting room, a confessional, nor a court of law. I suggest the\r\nwitness be excused and her last hysterical remarks expunged from the\r\nrecord.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so ordered,\" ruled Senator Jones. \"And now, gentlemen, we shall\r\nrecess until tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE\r\n\r\n_Man Triumphant ... I_\r\n\r\n\r\n_21._ The hearings of the Committee to Investigate Dangerous Vegetation\r\nwent on for five days and Mr Le ffaçasé was increasingly delighted as\r\nthe proceedings went down, properly edited and embellished to excite\r\nreader interest, in the columns of the _Daily Intelligencer_. He even\r\nunbent so far as to call me a fool without any adjectival modification,\r\nwhich was for him the height of geniality.\r\n\r\nI don't want to give the impression the committee stole the show, as the\r\nsaying goes. The show essentially and primarily was still the grass\r\nitself. It grew while the honorable body inquired and it grew while the\r\nhonorable body, tired by its labors, slept. It increased during the\r\nspeeches of Senator Jones, through the interjections of Judge Robinson,\r\nand as Dr Johnson added his wisdom to the deliberations.\r\n\r\nWhile the committee probed, listened and digested, the grass finally\r\npushed its way across Hollywood Boulevard, resisting frantic efforts by\r\nthe National Guard, the fire and police departments, and a volunteer\r\nbrigade of local merchants, to stem its course. It defied alike\r\nsharpened steel, fire, chemicals and explosives. Even the smallest\r\nrunner could now be severed only with the greatest difficulty, for in\r\nits advance the weed had toughened--some said because of its omnivorous\r\ndiet, others, its ability to absorb nitrogen from the air--and its\r\nrubbery quality caused it to yield to onslaught only to bound back,\r\napparently uninjured, after each blow.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disquieting aspects of the advance was its variability\r\nand unpredictability. To the west, it had hardly gone five blocks from\r\nthe Dinkman house, while southward it had crossed Santa Monica Boulevard\r\nand was nosing toward Melrose. Its growth had been measured and checked,\r\nover and over again, but the figures were never constant. Some days it\r\ntraveled a foot an hour; on others it leapt nearly a city block between\r\nsunrise and nightfall.\r\n\r\nIt is simple to put down \"the grass crossed Hollywood Boulevard\"; as\r\nsimple as saying, \"our troops advanced\" or \"the man was hanged at dawn.\"\r\nBut when I write these words less than a generation later, surrounded by\r\nrolling hills, gentle brooks, and vast lawns sedate and tame, I can\r\nclose my eyes and see again the green glacier crawling down the\r\nsidestreets and over the low roofs of the shops to pour like a cascade\r\nupon the busy artery.\r\n\r\nOnce more I can feel the crawling of my skin as I looked upon the\r\nmethodical obliteration of men's work. I can see the tendrils splaying\r\nout over the sidewalks, choking the roadways, climbing walls, finding\r\nvulnerable chinks in masonry, bunching themselves inside apertures and\r\nbursting out, carrying with them fragments of their momentary prison as\r\nthey pursued their ruthless course.\r\n\r\nNow the uproar and clamor of a disturbed public swelled to giant volume.\r\nAll the disruption and distress going before had been news; this was\r\ndisaster. \"All same Glauman's Chinese, all same Pa'thenon,\" remarked\r\nGootes, and indeed I have heard far less outcry over the destruction of\r\nhistoric landmarks than was raised when the grass obscured the\r\ncelebrated footprints.\r\n\r\nRecall of the mayor was demanded and councilmen's official limousines\r\nwere frequently overturned. Meetings denounced the inaction of the\r\nauthorities; a gigantic parade bearing placards calling for an end to\r\nprocrastination marched past the cityhall. Democrats blamed Republicans\r\nfor inefficiency and Republicans retorted that Miss Francis had done her\r\nresearch during a Democratic administration.\r\n\r\nEvery means previously tried and found wanting was tried again as though\r\nit were impossible for human minds to acknowledge defeat by an insensate\r\nplant. The axes, the scythes, weedburners and reapers were brought out\r\nagain, only to prove their inability to cope with the relentless flow of\r\nthe grass. Robot tanks loaded with explosives disappeared as had those\r\ncontaining the soldiers, and only the stifled sound of their explosion\r\nregistered the fact that they had fulfilled their design if not their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for the man on the street to understand how the weapons\r\nsuccessful in Normandy and Tarawa could be balked by vegetation. Like\r\nthe Investigating Committee's pursuit of the question of the crudeoil's\r\nadulteration, they wanted to know if the tanks were firstline vehicles\r\nor some surplus palmed off by the War Department; if the weedburners\r\nwere properly accredited graminicides or just a bunch of bums taken from\r\nthe reliefrolls. The necessary reverse of this picture was the jubilant\r\nhailing of each new instrument of attack, the brief but hysterical\r\nenthusiasm for each in turn as the ultimate savior.\r\n\r\nBecause of my unique position I witnessed the trial of them all. I saw\r\ntanks dragging rotary plows and others equipped with devices like\r\nelectricfans but with blades of hardened steel sharpened to razor\r\nkeenness. The only thing this latter gadget did was to scatter more\r\npotential nuclei to the accommodating wind.\r\n\r\nI saw the Flammenwerfer, the dreadful flamethrowers which had scorched\r\nthe bodies of men like burnt toast in an instant, direct their\r\nconcentrated fire upon the advancing runners. I smelled the sweetly sick\r\nsmell of steaming sap and saw the runners shrivel and curl back as they\r\nhad done on other occasions, until nothing was presented to the\r\nflamethrowers except the tangled mass of interwoven stems denuded of all\r\nfoliage. Upon this involved wall the fire had no effect, the stems did\r\nnot wilt, the hard membranes did not collapse, the steely network did\r\nnot retreat. It seemed a drawn battle in one small sector, yet in that\r\nvery part where the grass paused on the ground it rose higher into the\r\nair like a poising tidalwave. Higher and higher, until its crest,\r\nunbalanced, toppled forward to engulf its tormentors.\r\n\r\nThen the unruffled advance resumed, again some resource was interposed\r\nagainst it, again it was checked for an instant and again it overcame\r\nits adversary, careless of obstacles, impartially taking to itself gouty\r\nroominghouses and pimping frenchprovincial (\"17 master bedrooms\")\r\nchateaus, hotdogstand and Brown Derby, cornergrocery and pyramidal\r\nfoodmart; undeterred by anything in its path.\r\n\r\nWhen you say a clump of weed attacked a city you utter an absurdity. I\r\nthink everyone was aware of the fantastic discrepancy between statement\r\nof the event and the event itself. So innocent and ridiculous the grass\r\nlooked as it made its first tentative thrust at the urban nerves; the\r\ngreen blades sloped forward like some prettily arranged but\r\nunimaginative corsage upon the concrete bosom of the street. You could\r\nnot believe those fragile seeming strands would resist the impress of a\r\ncareless boot, much less the entire arsenal of military and agricultural\r\nimplements. It must have been this deceptive fragility which broke the\r\nspirit of so many people.\r\n\r\nFrom an item in the _Intelligencer_ I recalled the existence of one of\r\nMrs Dinkman's neighbors who had rudely refused the opportunity to have\r\nhis lawn treated with the Metamorphizer. He had left an incoherent\r\nsuicidenote: \"Pigeons in the grass alas. Too many pigeons, too much\r\ngrass. Pigeons are doves, but Noah expressed a raven. Contradiction\r\nlies. Roses are red, violets are blue. The grass is green and I am thru.\r\nToo too too. Darling kiddies.\" He then, in full view of the helpless\r\nweedfighters, marched on into the grass and was lost to sight.\r\n\r\nIn the days following, so many selfdestructions succeeded this one that\r\nthe grass became known in the papers as the Green Horror. Perhaps a\r\npeculiar sidelight on human oddity was revealed in most of these\r\nsuicides choosing to immolate themselves, not in the main body of the\r\ngrass, but in one of the many smaller nuclei springing up in close\r\nproximity.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune to witness the confluence of two of these descendant\r\nbodies. They had come into being only a few blocks apart; understandably\r\ntheir true character was unrecognized until they were out of control and\r\nhad enveloped the neighborhoods of their origin. They crept toward each\r\nother with a sort of incestuous attraction until mere yards separated\r\nthem; they paused skittishly, the runners crawled forward speculatively,\r\nthe green fronds began overlapping like clasping fingers, then with\r\naccelerating speed came together much as a pack of cards in the hands of\r\na deft shuffler slides edge under edge to make a compact and indivisible\r\nwhole. The line of division disappeared, the two became one, and where\r\nbefore there had been left a narrow path for men to tread, now only a\r\nserene line of vegetation outlined itself against the unblinking sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n_22._ I have said Mr Le ffaçasé had softened his brutality toward me,\r\nbut his favor did not extend--so pervasive is literary jealousy--to\r\nprinting my own reports. He continued to subject me to the indignity of\r\nbeing \"ghosted,\" a thoroughly expressive term, which by a combination of\r\nbad conjugation and the suggestion of insubstantiality defines the sort\r\nof prose produced, by Jacson Gootes. This arrangement, instead of giving\r\nme some freedom, shackled me to the reporter, who dashed from celebrity\r\nto celebrity, grass to nuclei, office to point of momentary interest,\r\nwith unflagging energy and infuriating jocosity. I knew his repertory of\r\ntricks and accents down to the last yawn.\r\n\r\nMost of all I resented his irregular habits. He never arrived at the\r\n_Intelligencer_ office on time or quit after a proper day's work. He\r\nthought nothing of getting me out of bed before I'd had my eight hours'\r\nsleep to accompany him on some ridiculous errand. \"Bertie, old dormouse,\r\nthe grass is knocking at the doors of NBC.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I answered, annoyed. \"It started down Vine Street\r\nyesterday. It would be more surprising if it obligingly paused before\r\nthe studios.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cynic,\" he said, pulling the bedclothes away from my face. I consider\r\nthis the lowest form of horseplay I know of. \"How quickly your ideals\r\nhave been tarnished by contact with the vulgar world of newspaperdom.\r\nFront and center, Bertie lad, we must catch the grass making its own\r\nsoundeffects before they jerk out the microphones.\"\r\n\r\nProtests having no effect I reluctantly went with him, but the scene was\r\nmerely a repetition of hundreds of previous ones, the grass being no\r\nmore or less spectacular for NBC than for Watanabe's Nursery and Cut\r\nFlower Shop a halfmile away. Its aftereffects, however, were immediate.\r\nThe governor declared martial law in Los Angeles County and ordered the\r\nevacuation of an area five miles wide on the perimeter of the grass.\r\n\r\nFurious cries of anguish went up from those affected by the arbitrary\r\norder. What authority had any official to dispossess honest people from\r\ntheir homes in times of peace? The right to hold their property\r\nunmolested was a prerogative vested in the humblest American and who was\r\nthe governor to abrogate the Constitution, the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, and manifold decisions of the Supreme Court? In embittered\r\nfury Henry Miller resigned from the Investigating Committee, now defunct\r\nanyway, its voluminous and inconclusive report buried in the state\r\narchives. Injunctions issued from local courts like ashes from a\r\nstirring volcano, but the militia were impervious and hustled the\r\nfreeholders from their homes with callous disregard for the sacred dues\r\nof property.\r\n\r\nWhen the reason behind this evacuation order leaked out a still greater\r\nlamentation was evoked, for the National Guard was planning nothing less\r\nthan a saturation incendiary bombing of the entire area. The bludgeon\r\nwhich reduced the cities of Europe to mere shells must surely destroy\r\nthis new invader. Even the stoutest defenders of property conceded this\r\nmust be so--but what was the point of annihilating the enemy if their\r\nholdings were to be sacrificed in the process? No, no, let the governor\r\ntake whatever means he pleased to dispatch the weed so long as the\r\nmethod involved left them homes to enjoy when things were--as they\r\ninevitably must be--restored to normal. So frantic were their efforts\r\nthat the Supreme Court actually forced the governor to postpone his\r\nproposed bombing, though it did not discontinue the evacuation.\r\n\r\nThere were few indeed who understood how the weed would digest the very\r\nwood, bricks or stucco and who packed up and moved out ahead of the\r\ntroops. American flags and shotguns recalled the heroic days of the\r\nfrontier, and defiance of the governor's edict was the rule instead of\r\nthe exception. Fierce old ladies dared the militiamen to lay a finger on\r\nthem or their possessions and apoplectic gentlemen, eyes as glazed as\r\nthose of the huntingtrophies on their walls, sputtered refusals to stir,\r\nno, not for all the brutal force in the world. No one was seriously hurt\r\nin this rebellion, the commonest wound being long scratches on the\r\ncheeks of the guardsmen, inflicted by feminine nails, as with various\r\ndegrees of resistance the inhabitants were carried or shooed from their\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\nWhile the wrangling over its destruction went on, the grass continued\r\nits progress. Out through Cahuenga Pass it flowed, toward fertile San\r\nFernando Valley. Steadily it climbed to the hilltops, masticating sage,\r\ngreasewood, oak, sycamore and manzanita with the same ease it bolted\r\nhouses and pavements. Into Griffith Park it swaggered, mumbling the\r\nplanetarium, Mount Hollywood and Fern Dell in successive mouthfuls and\r\nswarmed down to the concretelined bed of the Los Angeles River. Here\r\nineffectual shallow pools had preserved illusion and given tourists\r\nsomething at which to laugh in the dry season; the weed licked them up\r\nlike a thirsty cow at a wallow. Up and down and over the river it ran,\r\neach day with greater speed.\r\n\r\nIt broke into the watermains, it tore down the poles bearing electric,\r\ntelephone and telegraph wires, it forced its way between the threaded\r\njoints of gaspipes and turned their lethal vapor loose in the air until\r\nall services in the vicinity were hastily discontinued. Short weeks\r\nafter I'd inoculated Mrs Dinkman's lawn, that part of Los Angeles known\r\nas Hollywood had disappeared from the map of civilization and had become\r\none solid mass of green devilgrass.\r\n\r\nNo one refused to move for this dispossessor as they had for the\r\ngovernor; thousands of homeless fled from it. Their going clogged the\r\nhighways with automobiles and produced an artificial gasoline shortage\r\nreminiscent of wartime. In downtown Los Angeles freightcars stood\r\nunloaded on their sidings, their consignees out of business and the\r\nwarehouses glutted. The strain on local transportation, already\r\nenfeebled by a publicservice system designed for a city one twentieth\r\nits size and a complete lack of those facilities mandatory in every\r\nother large center of population, increased by the necessary rerouting\r\naround the affected area, threatened disruption of the entire organism\r\nand the further disintegration of the city's already weakened\r\ncoordination. The values of realestate dropped, houses were sold for a\r\nsong, officebuildings for an aria, hotels for a chorus.\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, secure in the knowledge its city\r\nsuffered from nothing worse than fires, earthquakes, a miserable\r\nclimate, and an invincible provincialism, invited displaced businessmen\r\nto resettle themselves in an area where improbable happenings were less\r\nlikely; and the state of Oklahoma organized a border patrol to keep out\r\nCalifornians.\r\n\r\nI could not blame the realestate men for attempting to unload their\r\nholdings before they suffered the fate of one tall building at Hollywood\r\nand Highland. The grass closed about its base like a false foundation\r\nand surged on to new conquests, leaving the monolith bare and forlorn in\r\nits new surroundings. At first the weed satisfied itself with jocular\r\nand teasing ventures up the smooth sides; then, as though rasped by the\r\nskyscraper's quiescence, it forced its way into the narrow space between\r\nthe steel sash, filling the lower floor and bursting out again in a riot\r\nof whirling tendrils. Up the sides it climbed like some false ivy;\r\nclinging, falling back, building upon its own defeated body until it\r\nreached another story--and another and another. At each one the tale was\r\nrepeated: windows burglariously forced, a floor suffocated, egress\r\neffected, and another height of wall scaled. At the end the proud\r\nstructure was a lonely obelisk furred in a green covering to the very\r\nflagpole on its peak, from which waved disappointed yet still aspiring\r\nrunners.\r\n\r\nUpward and outward continuously, empty lot, fillingstation, artistic\r\nbillboard, all alike to the greedy fingers. Like thumb and index they\r\nformed a crescent, a threatening semicircle, reaching forward by\r\nindirection. Northward and southeastward, the two aqueducts kept the\r\ndesert from reclaiming its own; for fifty years the city had scraped up,\r\nbought, pilfered or systematically robbed all the water it could get;\r\nthrough the gray, wet lines, siphons, opencuts, pumps, lifts, tunnels,\r\nthe metropolis sucked life. Now the desert had an ally, the grassy\r\nfingers avoided the downtown district, feeling purposefully and\r\ndangerously toward the aqueducts.\r\n\r\nI spent much of my time, when not actively watching the grass, in the\r\n_Intelligencer_ office. I had now agreed to write articles for several\r\nweekly magazines, and though they edited my copy with a heavy and\r\nunappreciative hand, still they never outraged me as Le ffaçasé did by\r\ncausing another man to usurp my name. Since I was in both senses\r\nnominally a member of the staff, I had no qualms about using the\r\njournal's typewriters and stationery for the construction of little\r\nessays on the grass as seen through the eyes of one who had cause to\r\nknow it better than anyone else.\r\n\r\n\"The-uh curse of Garry-baldi be upon the head of that ee-veal man who-uh\r\ncontrols this organeye-zation,\" rolled out Gootes in pseudoChurchillian\r\ntones. \"The-uh monster has woven a web; we are-uh summoned, Bertie.\"\r\n\r\nI got up resignedly and followed him to the managingeditor's office. We\r\nwere not greeted directly. Instead, a question was thrown furiously over\r\nour heads. \"Where is he? What bristling and baseless egomania sways him\r\nto affront the _Daily Intelligencer_ with his contumacious and indecent\r\nunpunctuality?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, chief?\" asked Gootes.\r\n\r\nLe ffaçasé ignored him. \"When this great newspaper condescends to shed\r\nthe light of acceptance, to say nothing of an obese and taxable\r\npaycheck, upon the gross corpus of an illiterate moviecameraman, a false\r\nDaguerre, a spurious Steichen, a dubious Eisenstein, it has a right to\r\nexpect a return for the goods showered upon such a deceitful sluggard.\"\r\n\r\nStill ignoring Gootes, he turned to me, and apparently putting the\r\nberated one from his mind, went on with comparative mildness: \"Weener,\r\nan unparalleled experience is to fall to your lot. You have not achieved\r\nthis opportunity through any excellence of your own, for I must say,\r\nafter lengthy contact, no vestige of merit in you is perceptible either\r\nto the nude eye or through an ultramicroscope. Nevertheless, by pure\r\nunhappy chance you are the property of the _Intelligencer_, and as such\r\nthis illustrious organ intends to confer upon you the signal honor of\r\nbeing a Columbus, a Van Diemen, an Amundsen. You, Weener, in your\r\nunworthy person, shall be the first man to set foot upon a virgin land.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech being no more comprehensible to me than his excoriation of\r\nan unknown individual, I could only stay silent and try to look\r\nappreciative.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Weener, you; some refugee from the busy newsroom of the Zwingle\r\n(Iowa) _Weekly Patriot_,\" a disdainful handwave referred this\r\ndescription to Gootes; \"some miserable castoff from a fourthrate quickie\r\nstudio masquerading as a newscameraman; and a party of sheep--perhaps I\r\ncould simplify my whole sentence by saying merely a party of bloody\r\nsheep--will be landed by parachute on top of the grass this very\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nHe smacked his lips. \"I can see tomorrow's bannerline now: 'Agent of\r\nDestruction Views Handiwork.' Should you chance to survive, your\r\nghostwritten impressions--for which we pay too high a price, far too\r\nhigh a price--will become doubly valuable. Should you come, as I\r\nconfidently expect, to a logical conclusion, the _Intelligencer_ will\r\nsupply a suitable obituary. Now get the bloody hell out of here and\r\neither let me see you never again, or as a triumphant Balboa who has\r\nsat, if not upon a peak in Darien, at least upon something more\r\nimportant than your own backside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_23._ The inside of the converted armybomber smelled like exactly what\r\nit was--a barn. Ten sheep and a solitary goat were tethered to\r\nstanchions along the sides. The sheep bleated continuously, the goat\r\nlooked cynically forbearing, and all gave off an ammoniacal smell which\r\nwas not absorbed by the bed of hay under their hoofs.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for this venture was an emotion I found practically\r\nimpossible to summon up. Even without Le ffaçasé's sanguinary\r\nprophecies, I objected to the trip. I had never been in a plane in my\r\nlife, and this for no other reason than disinclination. I feared every\r\npossible consequence of the parachutejump, from instant annihilation\r\nthrough a broken neck in the jerk of its opening, down to being\r\nsmothered in its folds on the ground. I distinctly did not want to go.\r\n\r\nBut caution sometimes defeats itself; I was so afraid of going that I\r\nhesitated to admit my timidity and so I found myself herded with my two\r\ncompanions, the pilot and crew, in with the sheep and the goat. I was\r\nnot resigned, but I was quiescent. Gootes and the animals were not.\r\n\r\nWhile we waited he went through his entire stock of tricks including a\r\nfew new ones which were not completely successful, before the cameraman,\r\npanting, arrived ten minutes after our scheduled departure. His name was\r\nRafe Slafe--which I thought an improbable combination of syllables--and\r\nhe was so chubby in every part you imagined you saw the smile which\r\nought to have gone with such a face and figure. Before his breath had\r\nsettled down to a normal routine, Gootes had rushed upon him with an\r\nenthusiastic, \"Ah, Rafello muchacho, give to me the abrazo; como usted,\r\ncompañero?\"\r\n\r\nSlafe scorned reply, pushing Gootes aside with one plump hand while with\r\nthe other he tidied the sparse black hairs of his mustache, which was\r\ntrimmed down to an eyebrow shading his lip. After inspecting and\r\nrejecting several identical bucketseats he found one less to his\r\ndistaste than the others and stowed his equipment, which was extensive,\r\nrequiring several puffing trips backandforth, next to it. Then he\r\nlowered his backside onto the unyielding surface with the same anxiety\r\nwith which he might have deposited a fortune in a dubious bank.\r\n\r\nHis hands darted in and out of pockets which apparently held a small\r\npharmacopoeia. Pulling out a roll of absorbentcotton from which he\r\nplucked two wads, he stuck them thoughtfully in his ears. He withdrew a\r\nnasalsyringe and used it vigorously, swallowed gulps of a clearly\r\nlabeled seasickremedy, and then sucked at pills from various boxes whose\r\npurpose was not so obvious. To conclude, he unstopped a glass vial and\r\nsniffed at it. All the while Gootes hovered over him, solicitously\r\ndeluging him with friendly queries in one accent or another.\r\n\r\nI lost interest in both fellowpassengers, for the plane, after shaking\r\nus violently, started forward, and before I was clearly aware of it had\r\nleft the ground. Looking from the windows I regretted my first airplane\r\nride hadnt been taken under less trying circumstances, for it was an\r\nextraordinarily pleasant experience to see the field dwindle into a\r\nminiature of itself and the ground beneath become nothing more than a\r\nlarge and highly colored reliefmap.\r\n\r\nTo our right was the stagnant river, dammed up behind the blockading arm\r\nof grass. Leftward, downtown, the thumb of the cityhall pointed rudely\r\nupward and far beyond was the listless Pacific. Ahead, the gridiron of\r\nstreets was shockingly interrupted and severed by the great green mass\r\nplumped in its center.\r\n\r\nIt grew to enormous bigness and everything else disappeared; we were\r\nover and looked down upon it, a pasture hummock magnified beyond belief;\r\nretaining its essential identity, but made ominous by its unappropriate\r\nsituation and size. As we hovered above the very pinnacle, the rounded\r\npeak which poked up at us, the pilot spoke over the intercommunication\r\nsystem. \"We will circle till the load is disposed of. First the animals\r\nwill be dropped, then the equipment, finally the passengers. Is that\r\nclear?\"\r\n\r\nEverything was clear to me except how we should escape from that green\r\nmountain once we had got upon it. This was apparently in the hands of Le\r\nffaçasé, a realization, remembering his grisly conversation, making me\r\nno easier in my mind. Nor did I relish the pilot's casual description of\r\nmyself as part of a \"load\"--to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nSlafe suddenly came to life and after peering through a sort of\r\nlorgnette hanging round his neck, mumbling unintelligibly to himself all\r\nthe while, started his camera which went on clicking magically with no\r\napparent help from him. Efficiently and swiftly the crew fastened upon\r\nthe helpless and bleating sheep their parachutes and onebyone dropped\r\nthem through the open bombbay. The goat went last and she did not bleat,\r\nbut dextrously butted two of her persecutors and micturated upon the\r\nthird before being cast into space.\r\n\r\nI would have forgone the dubious honor of being the first to land upon\r\nthe grass, but the crew apparently had their orders; I was courteously\r\ntapped upon the shoulder--I presume the warders are polite when they\r\nenter the condemned cell at dawn--my chute was strapped upon me and the\r\ninstructions I had already read in their printed form at least sixty\r\ntimes were repeated verbally, so much to my confusion that when I was\r\nfinally in the air I do not know to this day whether I counted six,\r\nsixty, six hundred, or six thousand before jerking the ripcord. Whatever\r\nthe number, it was evidently not too far wrong, for although I received\r\na marrowexploding shock, the parachute opened and I floated down.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner were my fears of the parachute's performance relieved than\r\nI was for the first time assailed with apprehension at the thought of my\r\ndestination. The grass, the weed, the destroying body which had devoured\r\nso much was immediately below me. I was irrevocably committed to come\r\nupon it--not at its edges where other men battled with it\r\nheroically--but at its very heart, where there were none to challenge\r\nit.\r\n\r\nStill tormented and dejected, I landed easily and safely a few feet from\r\nthe goat and just behind the rearquarters of one of the sheep.\r\n\r\nAnd now I pause in my writing to sit quite still and remember--more\r\nthan remember, live through again--the sensation of that first physical\r\ncontact with the heart of the grass. Ecstasy is a pale word to apply to\r\nthe joy of touching and resting upon that verdure. Soft--yes, it was\r\nsoft, but the way sand is soft, unyieldingly. Unlike sand, however, it\r\ndid not suggest a tightlypacked foundation, but rather the firmness of a\r\ngood mattress resting on a wellmade spring. It was resilient, like\r\ncarefully tended turf, yet at the same time one thought, not of the\r\nsolid ground beneath, but of feathers, or even more of buoyant clouds.\r\nMy parachute having landed me gently on my feet, I sank naturally to my\r\nknees, and then, impelled by some other force than gravity, my body fell\r\nfully forward in complete relaxation until my face was buried in the\r\nthickly growing culms and my arms stretched out to embrace as much of\r\nthe lush surface as they could encompass.\r\n\r\nFar more complex than the mere physical reactions were the psychical\r\nones. When a boy I had, like every other, daydreamed of discovering new\r\ncontinents, of being first to climb a hitherto unscaled peak, to walk\r\nbefore others the shores of strange archipelagoes, to bring back tales\r\nof outlandish places and unfrequented isles. Well, I was doing these\r\nthings now, long after the disillusionment adolescence brought to these\r\nchildish dreams. But in addition it was in a sense _my_ island, _my_\r\nmountain, _my_ land--for I had caused it to be. A sensation of\r\ntremendous vivacity and wellbeing seized upon me; I could not have lain\r\nupon the grass more than half a second before I leaped to my feet. With\r\na nimbleness quite foreign to my natural habits I detached the\r\nencumbering chute and jumped and danced upon the sward. The goat\r\nregarded me speculatively through rectangular pupils, but did not offer,\r\nin true capricious fashion, to gambol with me. Her criticism did not\r\nstay me, for I felt absolutely free, extraordinarily exhilarated,\r\ninordinately stimulated. I believe I even went so far as to shout out\r\nloud and break into song.\r\n\r\nThe descent of Slafe, still solemnly recording the event, camera before\r\nhim in the position of present arms, did not sober my intoxication,\r\nthough circumspection caused me to act in a more conventional way. I\r\nfreed him from his harness, for he was too busy taking views of the\r\ngrass, the sky, the animals and me to perform this service for himself.\r\n\r\nI do not know if he was affected the way I was, for his deceptively\r\ngenial face showed no emotion as he went on aiming his camera here and\r\nthere with sour thoroughness. Then, apparently satisfied for the moment,\r\nhe applied himself once more to the nasalsyringe and the pillboxes.\r\n\r\nOn Gootes, however, the consequence of the landing must have been much\r\nthe same as on me. He too capered and sang and his dialect renderings\r\nreached a new low, such as even a burlesqueshow comedian would have\r\nspurned. \"Tis the old sod itself,\" he kept repeating, \"Erin go bragh. Up\r\nDev!\" and he laughed inanely.\r\n\r\nWe must have wasted fully an hour in this fashion before enough coolness\r\nreturned to allow anything like calm observation. When it did, we\r\nunpacked the equipment, despite obstacles interposed by Gootes, who,\r\nstill hilarious, found great delight in making the various instruments\r\ndisappear and reappear unexpectedly. It was quite complete and we--or\r\nrather Slafe--recorded the thermometer and barometer readings as well as\r\nthe wind direction and altitude, these to be later compared with others\r\ntaken under normal conditions at the same hour.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the gear were telescope and binoculars; these we put to our\r\neyes only to realize with surprise that we were located in the center of\r\na hollow bowl perhaps a hundred and fifty or two hundred feet across and\r\nthat an horizon of upsurging vegetation cut off our view of anything\r\nexcept the sky itself. I could have sworn we had landed on a flat\r\nplateau, if indeed the contour had not sloped upward to a cap. How,\r\nthen, did we come to find ourselves in a depression? Did the grass shift\r\nlike the sea it resembled? Or--incredible thought--had our weight caused\r\nus to sink imperceptibly into a soft and treacherous bed?\r\n\r\nI felt my happiness oozing away. What is man, I thought, but a pigmy\r\ntrapped in a bowl, bounded by an unknown beginning and headed for a\r\nconcealed destination? It was sweet to be, but whether good or evil lay\r\nin the unseen, who knew? Uneasiness, which did not quite displace my\r\nearlier buoyancy, took hold of me.\r\n\r\nThe animals, in contrast, gave no signals of disquiet. They cropped at\r\nthe grass without nervousness, perhaps more from habit than hunger. They\r\ndid not seem to be obtaining much sustenance; clearly they found it hard\r\nto bite off mouthfuls of forage. Rather, they chewed sidewise, like a\r\ncat, at the tough rubbery tendrils.\r\n\r\n\"I tank I want to go home--anyways I tank I want to get out of dis\r\nhaole,\" remarked Gootes. Slafe had unpacked another camera and attached\r\nvarious gadgets to it, pursing his lips and running his hands lovingly\r\nover the assembled product before thrusting it downward into the stolons\r\nwhere queer shocks of radiance seemed to indicate he was taking\r\nflashlight pictures of the subsurface.\r\n\r\nBut the sheep and the cameraman could not distract my attention from the\r\nappearance of a trap which the basin of grass was assuming, while Gootes\r\nwas so volatile he couldnt even put on a simulated stoicism. In a panic\r\nI started to climb frantically, all the elation of my first encounter\r\nwith the mound completely evaporated. The goat raised her head to note\r\nmy undignified scrambling, but the sheep kept up their determined\r\nnibbling.\r\n\r\nThe trough, as I said, could not have been more than a couple of hundred\r\nfeet across and though the loose runners impeded my progress I must have\r\ncovered twice the distance to the edge of the rim before I realized it\r\nwas as far from me as when I had started. Gootes, going in a direction\r\noblique to mine, had no better success. His waving arms and struggling\r\nbody indicated his awareness of his predicament. Only Slafe was\r\nundisturbed, perhaps unconscious of our efforts, for he had taken out\r\nstill another camera and was lying on his back, pointing it over our\r\nheads at the boundary of grass and sky.\r\n\r\nHysteria burned my lungs as I continued the dreamlike battle upward.\r\nFear may have confused me, but it seemed as though the enveloping weed\r\nwas now positively rather than merely negatively hampering me. The\r\nrunners whipped around my legs in clinging spirals; the surface, always\r\nsoft, now developed treacherous spots like quicksands and while one foot\r\nremained comparatively secure, the other sank deeply, tripping me.\r\nProne, the entangling fronds caught at my arms and neck; the green\r\nblades, no longer tender, scratched my face and smothered my useless\r\ncries for help. I sobbed childishly, knowing myself doomed to die in\r\nthis awful morass, drowned in an unnatural sea.\r\n\r\nSo despairing were my thoughts that I gave up all struggle and lay there\r\nweakly crying when I noticed the grass relaxing its hold, I was sinking\r\nin no farther; indeed it seemed the lightest effort would set me free. I\r\nrose to my knees and finally to my feet, but I was so shaken by my\r\nbattle I made no attempt to continue forward, but stood gazing around me\r\nmarveling that I was still, even if only for a few more moments, alive.\r\n\r\n\"Belly belong you walk about too much, ay? Him fella look-look no got\r\nbelly.\" Gootes had given up his endeavor to reach the rim and apparently\r\nstruggled all the way over to impart, if I understood his _bêchedemer_,\r\nthis absurd and selfevident piece of information.\r\n\r\n\"This is hardly a time for levity,\" I rebuked him coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Couldnt think of a better. Reality is escaped through one flippancy or\r\nanother. Rafe has his--\" he waved his hand toward the still industrious\r\ncameraman \"--and I have mine. I bet W R has a telescope or a periscope\r\nor a spectroscope somehow trained on us right now and will see to it the\r\nrescue party arrives ten minutes after all life is extinct.\"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth I'd forgotten our expedition was but a stunt initiated\r\nby the _Daily Intelligencer_ to rebound to its greater publicity. Here\r\nin this isolate cup it was difficult to conceive of an anterior\r\nexistence; I thought of myself, as in some strange manner indigenous to\r\nand part of the weed. To recall now that we were here purposefully, that\r\nothers were concerned with our venture, and that we might reasonably\r\nhope for succor extricated me from my subjective entanglement with the\r\ngrass much as the relaxation of my body a short while before freed me\r\nfrom its physical bonds. I looked hopefully at the empty sky: of course\r\nwe would get help at any moment.\r\n\r\nOnce more my spirits were raised; there was no point in trying to get\r\nout of the depression now, seeing we could as easily be rescued from one\r\nportion of the grass as from another. Again the grass was soft and\r\npleasant to touch and Slafe's preoccupation with his pictures no longer\r\nseemed either eccentric or heroic, but rather proper and sensible. Like\r\nAlice and the Red Queen, since we had given up trying to reach a\r\nparticular spot we found ourselves able to travel with comparative ease.\r\nWe inspected Slafe's activities with interest and responded readily to\r\nhis autocratic gestures indicating positions and poses we should take in\r\norder to be incorporated in his record.\r\n\r\nBut our gaiety was again succeeded by another period of despondency; we\r\nrepeated all our antics, struggles and despair. Again I fought madly\r\nagainst the enmeshing weed and again I gave myself up to death only to\r\nbe revived in the moment of my resignation.\r\n\r\nThe cameraman was still untouched by the successive waves of fear and\r\njoyfulness. Invincibly armored by some strange spirit he kept on and on,\r\nalthough by now I could not understand--in those moments when I could\r\nthink about anything other than the grass--what new material he could\r\nfind for his film. Skyward and downward, to all points of the compass,\r\nholding his cameras at crazy angles, burlesquing all photographers, his\r\nzeal was unabated, unaffected even by the force of the grass.\r\n\r\nOur alternating moods underwent a subtle change: the spans of defeat\r\ngrew longer, the moments of hope more fleeting. The sheep too at last\r\nwere infected by uneasiness, bleating piteously skyward and making no\r\nattempt to nibble any longer. The goat, like Slafe, was unmoved; she\r\ndisdained the emotional sheep.\r\n\r\nAnd now with horror I suddenly realized that a physical change had\r\nmarched alongside the fluctuations of our temper. The circumference of\r\nthe bowl was the same as at first, but imperceptibly yet swiftly the\r\nhollow had deepened, sunk farther from the sky, the walls had become\r\nalmost perpendicular and to my terror I found myself looking upward from\r\nthe bottom of a pit at the retreating sky.\r\n\r\nI suppose everyone at some time has imagined himself irrevocably\r\nimprisoned, cast into some lightless dungeon and left to die. Such\r\nvisions implied human instrumentality, human whim; the most implacable\r\njailer might relent. But this, this was an incarceration no supplication\r\ncould end, a doom not to be stayed. Silently, evenly, unmeasuredly the\r\nwell deepened and the walls became more sheer.\r\n\r\nLike kittens about to be ignominiously drowned we slid into a huddled\r\nbunch at the bottom of the sack, men and animals equally helpless and\r\ndistraught. Fortunately it was during one of the now rare periods of\r\nresurgence that we saw the helicopter, for I do not think we should have\r\nhad the spiritual strength needful to help ourselves had it come during\r\nour times of dejection. Gootes and I yelled and waved our arms\r\nfrenziedly, while Slafe, exhibiting faint excitement for the first time,\r\ncontorted himself to aim the camera at the machine's belly. Evidently\r\nthe pilot spotted us without difficulty for the ship came to a hovering\r\nrest over the mouth of the well and a jacobsladder unrolled its length\r\nto dangle rope sides and wooden rungs down to us.\r\n\r\n\"Snatched from the buzzsaw as the express thundered across the switch\r\nand the water came up to our noses,\" chanted Gootes. \"W R has a vilely\r\nmelodramatic sense of timing.\"\r\n\r\nThe ladder was nearest Slafe, but working more furiously than ever, he\r\nwaved it impatiently aside and so I grasped it and started upward. The\r\nterror of the ascent paradoxically was a welcome one, for it was the\r\ncommon fear which comes to men on the battlefield or in the creaking\r\nhours of the night, the natural dread of ordinary perils and not the\r\nunmanning panic inspired by the awful unknown within the grass.\r\n\r\nThe helicopter shuddered and dipped, causing the unanchored ladder to\r\nsway and twist until with each convulsive jerk I expected to be thrown\r\noff. I bruised and burned my palms with the tightness of my grip, my\r\nknees twitched and my face and back and chest were wet. But in spite of\r\nall this, waves of thankfulness surged over me.\r\n\r\nThe roaring and rattling above grew louder and I made my way finally\r\ninto the open glassfronted cockpit, pulling myself in with the last bit\r\nof my strength. For a long moment I lay huddled there, exhausted. My eye\r\ntook in every trifle, every bolthead, rivet, scratch, dent, indicator,\r\nseam and panel, playing with them in my mind, making and rejecting\r\npatterns. They were artificial, made on a blessed assemblyline--no\r\nterrifying product of nature.\r\n\r\nI wondered how so small a space could accommodate us all and was\r\ndevoutly grateful that I, at least, had achieved safety. Reminded of my\r\ncompanions, I looked out and down. The grass walls towered upward almost\r\nwithin reach; beyond the hole they so unexpectedly made in its surface\r\nthe weed stretched out levelly, peaceful and inviting. I shuddered and\r\npeered down the reversed telescope where the ladder once more hung\r\ntemptingly before Slafe.\r\n\r\nAgain he waved it aside. Gootes appeared to argue with him for he shook\r\nhis head obstinately and went on using his camera. At length the\r\nreporter seized him forcibly with a strength I had not known he\r\npossessed and boosted him up the first rungs of the ladder. Slafe seemed\r\nat last resigned to leave, but he pointed anxiously to his other cameras\r\nand cans of film. Gootes nodded energetically and waved the photographer\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nI saw every detail of what happened then, emphasized and heightened as\r\nthough revealed through a slowmotion picture. I heard Slafe climb on\r\nboard and knew that in a few seconds now we would be free and away. I\r\nsaw the bright sun reflect itself dazzlingly upon the blades of the\r\ngrass, sloping imperceptibly away to merge with the city it squatted\r\nupon in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe sun where we were was dazzling, I say, but in the hole where Gootes\r\nwas now tying Slafe's paraphernalia to the ladder, the shadow of the\r\nwalls darkened it into twilight. I squinted, telepathically urging him\r\nto hurry; he seemed slow and fumbling. And then ...\r\n\r\nAnd then the walls collapsed. Not slowly, not with warning, not\r\ndramatically or with trumpets. They came together as silently and\r\nnaturally as two waves close a trough in the ocean, but without\r\ndisturbance or upheaval. They fell into an embrace, into a coalescence\r\nas inevitable as the well they obliterated was fortuitous. They closed\r\nlike the jaws of a trap somehow above malevolence, leaving only the top\r\nof the ladder projecting upward from the smooth and placid surface of\r\nthe weed.\r\n\r\nWhether in some involuntary recoil the pilot pressed a wrong control or\r\nwhether the action of the grass itself snatched the ladder from the ship\r\nI don't know; but that last bit attached to the machine was torn free\r\nand fell upon the green. It was the only thing to mark the spot where\r\nthe bowl which had held us had been, and it lay, a brown and futile\r\ntangle of rope and wood, a helpless speck of artifice on an\r\nimperturbable mass of vegetation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_24._ Mr Le ffaçasé removed the tube of the dictaphone from his lips as\r\nI entered. \"Weener, although a rigid adherence to fact compels me to\r\nclaim some acquaintance with general knowledge and a slight cognizance\r\nof abnormal psychology, I must admit bafflement at the spectacle of your\r\nmottled complexion once more in these rooms sacred to the perpetuation\r\nof truth and the dissemination of enlightenment. Everyday you embezzle\r\ngood money from this paper under pretense of giving value received, and\r\neach day your uselessness becomes more conspicuous. Almost anyone would\r\ndisapprove the divine choice in the matter of taking Gootes and leaving\r\nyou alive, and while I know the world suffered not the least hurt by his\r\ntranslation to whatever baroque, noisy and entirely public hell is\r\nreserved for reporters, at least he attempted to forge some ostensible\r\nreturn for his paycheck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Le ffaçasé,\" I began indignantly, but he cut me off.\r\n\r\n\"You unalloyed imbecile,\" he roared, \"at least have the prudence if not\r\nthe intelligence or courtesy to be silent while your betters are\r\nspeaking. Gootes was a bloody knave, a lazy, slipshod, slack, tasteless,\r\nabsurd, fawning, thieving, conniving sloven, but even if he had the\r\nenergy to make the attempt and a mind to put to it, he could not, in ten\r\nlifetimes, become the perfect, immaculate and prototypical idiot you\r\nwere born.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know how long he would have continued in this insulting vein,\r\nbut he was interrupted by the concealed telephone. \"What in the name of\r\nthe ten thousand dubious virgins do you mean by annoying me?\" he\r\nbellowed into the mouthpiece. \"Yes. Yes. I know all about deadlines; I\r\nwas a newspaperman when you were vainly suckling canine dugs. Are you\r\nambitious to replace me? Go get with child a mandrakeroot, you, you\r\njournalist! I will meet the _Intelligencer_'s deadline as I did before\r\nyour father got the first tepidly lustful idea in his nulliparous head\r\nand as I shall after you have followed your useless testes to a worthy\r\ndesuetude.\"\r\n\r\nHe replaced the receiver and picked up the mouthpiece of the dictaphone\r\nagain, paying no further attention to me. He enunciated clearly and\r\nprecisely, speaking in an even monotone, pausing not at all, as if\r\nreading from some prepared script, though his eyes were fixed upon a\r\nvacant spot where wall and ceiling joined.\r\n\r\n\"In the death today of Jacson Gootes the _Daily Intelligencer_ lost a\r\nson. It is an old and good custom on these solemn occasions to pause and\r\nremember the dead.\r\n\r\n\"Jacson Gootes was a reporter of exceptional probity, of clear\r\nunderstanding, of indefatigable effort, and of great native ability. His\r\nserious and straightforward approach to an occupation which to him was a\r\nlabor of love was balanced by a sunny yet thoughtful humor, a\r\ncombination making his company something to be sought. Beloved of his\r\nfellow workers, no one mourns his loss more sincerely than the editor\r\nthrough whose hands passed all those brilliant contributions, now\r\nfinally marked, as all newspaper copy is, -30-.\r\n\r\n\"But though the _Intelligencer_ has suffered a personal and deeply felt\r\nbereavement, American journalism has given another warrior on the\r\nbattlefield. Not by compulsion nor arbitrary selection, but of his own\r\nfree will, he who serves the public through the press is a soldier. And\r\nas a soldier he is ready at the proper time to go forward and give up\r\nhis life if need be.\r\n\r\n\"No member of a sturdy army was more worthy of a gallant end than Jacson\r\nGootes. He died, not in some burst of audacity such as may occasionally\r\nactuate men to astonishing feats, but doggedly and calmly in the line of\r\nduty. More than a mere hero, he was a good newspaperman. W.R.L.\"\r\n\r\nThere were tears under my eyelids as the editor concluded his eulogy.\r\nUnder that gruff and even overbearing exterior must beat a warm and\r\ntender heart. You can't go by appearances, I always say, and I felt I\r\nwould never again be hurt by whatever hasty words he chose to hurl at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Wake up, you moonstruck simpleton, and stop beaming at some private\r\nvision. The time has passed for you to live on the bounty of the\r\n_Intelligencer_ like the bloody mendicant you are. You have outlived\r\nyour usefulness as the man who started all this fuss; it is no longer\r\ngood publicity; the matter has become too serious.\r\n\r\n\"No, Weener, from now on, beneath your unearned byline the public will\r\nknow you only as the first to set foot upon this terra incognita, this\r\nverdant isle which flourishes senselessly where only yesterday Hollywood\r\nnourished senselessly. So rest no more upon your accidental laurels, but\r\ntransform yourself into what nature never intended, a useful member of\r\nthe community. I will make a newspaperman of you, Weener, if I have to\r\nbeat into your head an entire typefont, from fourpoint up to and\r\nincluding those rare boldfaced letters we keep in the cellar to announce\r\non our final page one the end of the world.\r\n\r\n\"You will cover the grass as before and you will bring or send or cause\r\nin some other manner to be transmitted to me copy without a single\r\nadjective or adverb, containing nothing more lethal than verbs, nouns,\r\nprepositions and conjunctions, stating facts and only facts, clearly\r\nand distinctly in the least possible number of words compatible with the\r\nusages of English grammar. You will do this daily and conscientiously,\r\nWeener, on pain of instant dismemberment, to say nothing of crucifixion\r\nand the death of a thousand cuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Weekly Ruminant_ and the _Honeycomb_ have found little pieces of\r\nmine, written without special instructions, suitable for their columns,\"\r\nI mentioned defensively.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself back in his chair and stared at me with such\r\nconcentrated fury I thought he would burst the diamond stud loose from\r\nhis shirtband. \"The _Weekly Ruminant_,\" he informed me, \"was founded by\r\na parsimonious whoremaster whose sanctimonious rantings in public were\r\nequaled only by his private impieties. It was brought to greatness--if\r\ninflated circulation be a synonym--by a veritable journalistic pimp who\r\npandered to the public taste for literary virgins by bribing them to\r\ncommit their perverse acts in full view. It is now carried on by a\r\nspectral corporation, losing circulation at the same rate a haemophilic\r\nloses blood.\r\n\r\n\"As for the _Honeycomb_, it is enough to say that careful research\r\nproves its most absorbing reading to be the 'throw away your truss' ads.\r\nIs it not natural, Weener, that two such journals of taste and\r\nenlightenment should appreciate your efforts? Unfortunately the _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_ demands accounts written in intelligible English above\r\nthe level of fourthgrade grammarschool.\"\r\n\r\nI would have been shocked beyond measure at his libelous smirching of\r\nhonored names and hurt as well by his slighting reference to myself had\r\nI not known from the revealing editorial he had dictated what a\r\nsympathetic and kindly nature was really his and how he might, beneath\r\nthis cynical pose, have an admiration great as mine for the characters\r\nhe had just slandered.\r\n\r\n\"You will be the new Peter Schlemihl, Weener; from now on you will go\r\nforth without a ghost and any revision essential to your puny assault\r\nupon the Republic of Letters will be done by me and God help you if I\r\nfind much to do, for my life is passing and I must have time to read\r\nthe immortal Hobbes before I die.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of all he'd said I couldnt help but believe Mr Le ffaçasé\r\nrealized my true worth--or why did he confer on me what was practically\r\na promotion? I was therefore emboldened to suggest the cancellation of\r\nthe unjust paycut, but this innocent remark called forth such a\r\nvituperative stream of epithet I really thought the apoplexy Gootes had\r\npredicted was about to strike and I hurried from his presence lest I be\r\nblamed for bringing it on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_25._ A little reading brought me uptodate on the state of the grass as\r\na necessary background for my new responsibility. It was now shaped like\r\na great, irregular crescent with one tip at Newhall, broadening out to\r\nbury the San Fernando Road; stretching over the Santa Monica Mountains\r\nfrom Beverly Glen to the Los Angeles River. Its fattest part was what\r\nhad once been Hollywood, Beverly Hills and the socalled Wilshire\r\ndistrict. The right arm of the semicircle, more slender than the left,\r\ncurled crookedly eastward along Venice Boulevard, in places only a few\r\nblocks wide. It severed the downtown district from the manufacturing\r\narea, crossing the river near the Ninth Street bridge and swallowing the\r\ngreat Searsroebuck store like a capsule. The office of the _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_, like the Civic Center, was unthreatened and able to\r\nfunction, but we were without water and gas, though the electric\r\nservice, subject to annoying interruptions, was still available.\r\n\r\nAlready arrangements were being completed to move the paper to Pomona,\r\nwhere the mayor and councilmanic offices also intended to continue. For\r\nthere was no hiding the fact that the city was being surrendered to the\r\nweed. Eastward and southward the homeless and the alarmed journeyed\r\ncarrying the tale of a city besieged and gutted in little more than the\r\ntime it would have taken a human army to fight the necessary\r\npreliminaries and bring up its big guns.\r\n\r\nOn trains and buses, by bicycles and on foot, the exodus moved. Those\r\nwho could afford it left their ravished homes swiftly behind by air and\r\nto these fortunate ones the way north was not closed, as it was to the\r\nearthbound, by the weed's overrunning of the highways. Usedcardealers\r\nsold out their stocks at inflated figures and a ceilingprice had to be\r\nput on the gasoline supplied to those retreating from the grass.\r\n\r\nThough only a fragment of the city had been lost, all industry had come\r\nto a practical standstill. Workers did not care to leave homes which\r\nmight be grassbound by nightfall; employers could not manufacture\r\nwithout backlog of materials, for a dwindling market, and without\r\ntransportation for their products. Services were so crippled as to be\r\nbarely existent and with the failure of the watersupply, epidemics, mild\r\nat first, broke out and the diseases were carried and spread by the\r\nrefugees.\r\n\r\nCattlemen, uncertain there would be either stockyards or working\r\nbutchers, held back their shipments. Truckfarmers found it simpler and\r\nmore profitable to supply local depots catering at fantastic prices to\r\nthe needs of the fugitives, than to depend on railroads which were\r\nalready overstrained and might consign their highly perishable goods to\r\nrot on a siding. Los Angeles began to starve. Housewives rushed\r\nfrantically to clean out the grocer's shelves, but this was living off\r\ntheir own fat and even the most farsighted of hoarders could provide for\r\nno more than a few weeks of future.\r\n\r\nSo even those not directly evicted or frightened by its proximity began\r\nmoving away from the grass. But they still had possessions and they\r\nwanted to take them along, all of them, down to the obsolescent console\r\nradio in grandma's room, the busted mantelclock--a weddingpresent from\r\nAunt Minnie--in the garage and the bridgelamp without a shade which had\r\nso long rested in the mopcloset. All of this taxed an already\r\noverstrained transportation system. Since it was entirely a oneway\r\ntraffic, charges were naturally doubled and even then shippers were\r\nreluctant to risk the return of their equipment to the threatened zone.\r\nThe greed to take along every last bit of impedimenta dwindled under the\r\nimpact of necessity; possessions were scrutinized for what would be\r\nleast missed, then for what could be got along without; for the\r\nabsolutely essential, and finally for things so dear it was not worth\r\ngoing if they were left behind. This last category proved surprisingly\r\nsmall, compact enough to be squeezed into the family car--\"Junior can\r\nsit on the box of fishingtackle--it's flat--and hold the birdcage on his\r\nlap\"--as it made ready to join the procession crawling along the clogged\r\nhighways.\r\n\r\n_Time_, reporting the progress of the weed, said in part: \"Death, as it\r\nmust to all, came last week to cult-harboring, movie-producing Los\r\nAngeles. The metropolis of the southwest (pop. 3,012,910) died\r\ngracelessly, undignifiedly, as its blood oozed slowly away. A shell\r\nremained: downtown district, suburbs, beaches, sprawling South and East\r\nsides, but the spirit, heart, brain, lungs and liver were gone;\r\nswallowed up, Jonah-wise by the advance of the terrifying Bermuda grass\r\n(TIME Aug. 10). Still at his post was sunk-eyed W. (for William) R. (for\r\nRufus) Le ffaçasé (pronounced L'Fass-uh-say), prolix, wide-read editor\r\nof the Los Angeles _Intelligencer_. Till the last press stopped the\r\n_Intelligencer_ would continue to disseminate the news. Among those\r\nremaining was Le ffaçasé's acereporter, Jacson C. (for Crayman) Gootes,\r\n28. Gootes' permanent beat: the heart of the menacing grass where he met\r\nhis death.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Religion, _Time_ had another note about the weed. \"Harassed\r\nAngelinos, distracted & terrified by encroaching _Cynodon dactylon_\r\n(TIME Aug. 10) now smothering their city (see National Affairs) were\r\nfurther distracted when turning on their radios (those still working)\r\nlast week. The nasal, portentous boom of the evangelist calling himself\r\nBrother Paul (real name: Algernon Knight Mood) announced the 2nd Advent.\r\nIt was taking place in the heart of the choking grass. What brought\r\ndeath and disaster to the country's 3rd city offered hope and bliss to\r\nfollowers of Brother Paul. 'Sell all you have,' advised the\r\nradiopreacher, 'fly to your Savior who is gathering His true disciples\r\nat this moment in the very center of the grass. Do not fear, for He will\r\nsustain and comfort you in the thicket through which the unsaved cannot\r\npass.' At last report countless followers had been forcibly restrained\r\nfrom self-immolation in the _Cynodon dactylon_, unnumbered others gone\r\njoyfully to their beatification. Not yet reported as joining his Savior:\r\nBrother Paul.\"\r\n\r\nUnder People: \"Admitted to the Relief rolls of San Diego County this\r\nweek were Adam Dinkman & wife, whose front lawn (TIME Aug. 3) was the\r\nstarting point of the plaguing grass. Said Mrs. Dinkman, 'The government\r\nought to pay....' Said Adam Dinkman, '... it's a terrible thing....'\"\r\n\r\nI resolved to send the Dinkmans some money as soon as I could possibly\r\nafford it. I made a note to this effect in a pocket memorandumbook,\r\nfeeling the glow of worthy sacrifice, and then went out and got in my\r\ncar. It was all right to digest facts and figures about the weed from\r\nthe printed page, but it was necessary to see again its physical\r\npresence before writing anything for so critical an editor as W R Le\r\nffaçasé.\r\n\r\nI drove through the Second Street tunnel and out Beverly Boulevard.\r\nThere, several miles from the most advanced runners of the grass, the\r\ncertainty of its coming lay like a smothering blanket upon the\r\nunnaturally silent district. There was no traffic on my side of the\r\nstreet and only a few lastminute straggling jalopies, loaded down with\r\nshameless bedding and bundles, coughed their way frantically eastward.\r\n\r\nThose few shops still unaccountably open were bare of goods and the idle\r\nproprietors walked periodically to the front to scan the western sky to\r\nassure themselves the grass was not yet in sight. But most of the stores\r\nwere closed, their windows broken, their signs already tarnished and\r\ndecrepit with the age which seems to come so swiftly upon a defunct\r\nbusiness. The sidewalks were littered with rubbish, diagonally flattened\r\npapers, broken boxes, odd shoes. Garbagecans, instead of standing\r\ndecorously in alleys or shamefacedly along the curb, sprawled in\r\nlascivious abandon over the pavements, their contents strewn widely.\r\nDogs and cats, deserted by fond owners, snarled and fought over choicer\r\ntidbits. I had not realized how many people in the city kept pets until\r\nthe time came to leave them behind.\r\n\r\nAt Vermont Avenue I came upon what I was sure was a new nucleus, a lawn\r\ngreen and tall set between others withered and yellow, but I did not\r\neven bother reporting this to the police for I knew that before long the\r\nmain body would take it to its bosom. And now, looking westward, I could\r\nsee the grass itself, a half mile away at Normandie. It rose high in the\r\nair, dwarfing the buildings in its path, blotting out the mountains\r\nbehind, and giving the illusion of rushing straight at me.\r\n\r\nI turned the car north, not with the idea of further observation, but\r\nbecause standing still in the face of that towering palisade seemed\r\nsomehow to invite immediate destruction. I drove slowly and thoughtfully\r\nand then at Melrose the grass came in sight again, creeping down from\r\nLos Feliz. I turned back toward the Civic Center. It would not be more\r\nthan a couple of days at most, now, before even downtown was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_26._ During my drive several walkers loaded with awkward bundles raised\r\nimploring thumbs for a ride, but knowing to what lengths desperation\r\nwill drive people and not wishing to be robbed of my car, I had pressed\r\nmy foot down and driven on. But now as I went along Temple near Rampart\r\na beautiful woman, incongruously--for it was in the middle of a hot\r\nOctober--dressed in a fur coat, and with each gloved hand grasping the\r\nhandle of a suitcase, stepped in front of me and I had to jam on the\r\nbrakes to avoid running over her.\r\n\r\nThe car stopped, radiator almost touching her, but she made no attempt\r\nto move. A small hat with a tiny fringe of veil concealed her eyes, but\r\nher sullen mouth looked furiously at me as rigidly clutching her luggage\r\nshe barred my path. Fearing some trap, I turned off the ignition and\r\nunobtrusively slid the keys into a sidepocket before getting out and\r\ngoing to her.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, miss. Can I help you?\"\r\n\r\nShe threw her head back and her eyes, brown and glistening, appraised me\r\nthrough heavily painted lashes. I stood there stiffly, uncomfortable\r\nunder her gaze till I suddenly remembered my hat and lifted it with an\r\nawkward bow. This seemed to satisfy her, for still without speaking she\r\nnodded and thrust the two suitcases at me. Not knowing what else to do,\r\nI took them from her and she promptly, after smoothing her gloves,\r\nwalked toward the passenger's side of the car.\r\n\r\n\"You want me to take you somewhere, miss?\" I inquired quite\r\nsuperfluously.\r\n\r\nShe bent her head the merest fraction and then rested her fingers on the\r\ndoorhandle, waiting for me to open it for her. I ran as fast as I could\r\nwith the bags--they were beautifully matched expensive luggage--to put\r\nthem in the turtle and then had to make myself still more ridiculous by\r\nrunning back for the forgotten key resting in the sidepocket. When I had\r\nfinally stowed away the baggage and opened the door for her she got in\r\nwith the barest of condescending nods for my efforts and sat staring\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nI drove very slowly, nipping off little glances of her profile as we\r\nmoved along. Her cheeks were smooth as a chinadoll's, her nose the\r\nchiseled replica of some lovely antique marble, her mouth a living study\r\nof rounded lines; never had I been so close to such an alluring woman.\r\nWe reached the Civic Center and I automatically headed for the\r\n_Intelligencer_ building. But I could not bear to part company so\r\nquickly and so I turned left instead, out Macy Street.\r\n\r\nNow we found ourselves caught in the traffic snailing eastward. In low\r\ngear I drove a block, then stopped and waited till a clear ten feet\r\nahead permitted another painfully slow forward motion. Still my\r\npassenger had no word to say but kept staring ahead though she could see\r\nnothing before her except the trunkladen rearend of a tottery ford long\r\npast its majority.\r\n\r\n\"You,\" I stumbled, \"I--that is, I mean wasnt there somewhere in\r\nparticular you wanted to go?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, still without looking at me, and for the first time spoke.\r\n\r\nHer voice was deep and had the timbre of some old bronze bell. \"Yuma,\"\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n\"Yuma, Arizona?\" I asked stupidly.\r\n\r\nAgain she nodded faintly. In a panic I reckoned the contents of my\r\nwallet. About forty dollars, I thought--no, thirty. Would that take us\r\nto Yuma? Barely, perhaps, and I should have to wire the _Intelligencer_\r\nfor money to return. Besides, in the present condition of the roads the\r\njourney would be a matter of days and I knew she would accept nothing\r\nbut the very best. How could I do it? Should I return to the\r\n_Intelligencer_ office and try to get an advance on next week's salary?\r\nI had heard from more than one disgruntled reporter that it was an\r\nimpossibility. Good heavens, I thought, I shall lose her.\r\n\r\nWhatever happened I must take her as far as I could; I must not let her\r\ngo before I was absolutely forced to. This resolution made, my first\r\nthought was to cut the time, for poking along in this packed mass I was\r\nburning gasoline without getting anywhere. Taking advantage of my\r\nknowledge of the sideroads, I turned off at the first chance and was\r\nable to resume a normal speed as I avoided towns and main highways.\r\n\r\nStill she continued silent, until at length, passing orangegroves heavy\r\nwith coppery fruit, I ventured to speak myself. \"My name is Albert\r\nWeener. Bert.\"\r\n\r\nThe right rear tire kicked up some dust as I nervously edged off the\r\nroad. Somewhere overhead a plane ripped through the hot silk of the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Uh ... what ... uh ... won't you tell me yours?\"\r\n\r\nStill facing ahead, she replied, \"It isnt necessary.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a few more miles I ventured again. \"You live--were living in Los\r\nAngeles?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head impatiently.\r\n\r\nWell, I thought, really...! Then: poor thing, she's probably terribly\r\nupset. Home and family lost perhaps. Money gone. Destitute. Going East,\r\nswallowing pride, make a new start with the help of unsympathetic\r\nrelatives. She has only me to depend on--I must not fail her. Break the\r\nice, whatever attitude her natural pride dictates, offer your services.\r\n\r\n\"I'm on the _Daily Intelligencer_,\" I said. \"I'm the man who first\r\nwalked on top of the grass.\"\r\n\r\nTen miles later I inquired, \"Wouldnt you be more comfortable with that\r\nheavy fur coat off? I can put it in the back with your luggage and it\r\nwon't be crushed.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head more impatiently.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I remembered the car radio installed a few days before. A\r\nlittle cheerful music calms the soul. I turned it on and got a band\r\nplaying a brandnew hit, \"Green as Grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. No noise.\"\r\n\r\nOf course. How thoughtless of me. The very word \"grass\" reminded her of\r\nher tragic situation. I kicked myself for my tactlessness.\r\n\r\nWe skirted Riverside and joined the highway again at Beaumont where we\r\nwere unavoidably packed into the slowmoving mass. \"I'm sorry,\" I\r\napologized, \"but I can take a chance again at Banning and drive up into\r\nthe mountains to get away from this.\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later I suggested stopping for something to eat. She shook her\r\nhead. \"But it's getting late,\" I said. \"Pretty soon we shall have to\r\nthink about stopping for the night.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her left hand imperatively. \"Drive all night.\"\r\n\r\nThis would certainly solve part of my financial problem, but I was\r\nhungry and unreasonably more irritated by her refusal of food than her\r\nunsociability. \"I have to eat, even if you don't,\" I told her rudely.\r\n\"I'm going to stop at the next place I see.\" With the same left hand she\r\nmade a gesture of resignation.\r\n\r\nI pulled up before the roadside cafe. \"Won't you change your mind and\r\ncome in? At least for a cup of coffee?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nI went in angrily and ate. Who was she, to treat me like a hired\r\nchauffeur? A mere pickup, I raged, a stray woman found on a street. By\r\nGod, she would have the courtesy at least to address me, her benefactor,\r\ncivilly or else I'd abandon her here on the highway and return to Los\r\nAngeles. I finished my meal full of determination and strode back\r\npurposefully toward the car. She was still sitting rigid, staring\r\nthrough the windshield. I got in.\r\n\r\n\"You know--\" I began.\r\n\r\nShe did not hear me. I turned on the ignition, pressed the\r\nstarterbutton, and drove ahead.\r\n\r\nSoddeneyed with lack of sleep and outraged at her taciturnity, I\r\nbreakfasted alone on the soggiest wheatcakes and the muddiest coffee I\r\nhave ever demeaned my stomach with. The absence of my customary morning\r\npaper added the final touch to my wretchedness. But one would have\r\nthought to look at my companion that she had been refreshed by a lengthy\r\nrepose, had bathed at leisure, and eaten the most delicate of\r\ncontinental breakfasts. There was not a smudge on her suede gloves nor a\r\nspeck upon her small hat and the mascara on her eyelashes might have\r\nbeen renewed but a moment before.\r\n\r\nThe road curved through vast hummocks of sand, which for no good reason\r\nreminded me of the grass in its early stages. Reminded, I wanted to know\r\nwhat the latest news was, how far the weed had progressed in the night.\r\nThoughtlessly, without remembering her interdiction, I turned the knob.\r\n\"Kfkfkk,\" squeaked the radio.\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" she said, in anything but a pleading tone, and turned it off.\r\n\r\nWell, I thought, this is certainly going too far. I opened my mouth to\r\nvoice the angry words but a look at her stopped me. I couldnt help but\r\nfeel her imperviousness was fragile, that harsh speech might shatter a\r\ncalm too taut to be anything but hysterical. I drove on without speaking\r\nuntil the hummocks gave way again to smooth desert. \"We'll soon be in\r\nYuma,\" I announced. \"Arent you going to tell me your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isnt important,\" she repeated.\r\n\r\n\"But it's important to me,\" I told her boldly. \"I want to know who the\r\nbeautiful lady was whom I drove from Los Angeles to Yuma.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head irritably and we crossed the bridge into Arizona.\r\n\r\n\"All right, this is Yuma. Now where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right here in the middle of the road?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. I looked helplessly at her, but her gaze was still fixed\r\nahead. Resignedly I got out, took her bags from the turtle and set them\r\nbeside the road, opened the door. She descended, smoothed her gloves,\r\nstraightened the edge of her veil, brushed an immaterial speck from her\r\ncoat and, after the briefest of acknowledging nods, picked up her grips.\r\n\r\n\"But ... can't I carry them for you?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not even answer this with her usual headshake, but began walking\r\nresolutely back over the way we had come. Bewildered, I watched her a\r\nmoment and then got into the car and turned it around, trying to keep\r\nher in sight in the rearview mirror as I did so. It was an awkward\r\nprocedure on a highway heavy with traffic. By the time I had reversed my\r\ndirection she was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_27._ Due either to Le ffaçasé's perverse sense of humor or, what is\r\nmore likely, his excessive meanness with money, my collect telegram\r\nasking for funds to return from Yuma received the following ridiculous\r\nreply: KNOW NO SANGUINARY WEENER INTELLIGENCER NO ELEEMOSYNARY\r\nINSTITUTION EAT CAKE. The meaning of the last two words escaped me and\r\nit was possible they were added purely to make the requisite ten. At all\r\nevents Le ffaçasé's parsimony made a very inconvenient and unpleasant\r\ntrip back for me, milestoned by my few valuable possessions pawned with\r\nsuspicious and grasping servicestation owners.\r\n\r\nWhen I left, a map of the downtown district would have resembled the\r\nprofile of a bowl. Now it was a bottle with only a narrow neck still\r\nclear. The weed had flung itself upon Pasadena and was curving back\r\nalong Huntington Drive, while to the south the opposing pincer was\r\nfeeling its way along Soto Street into Boyle Heights. It was only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty that I passed through the police lines into the\r\ndoomed district.\r\n\r\nIf I had thought deserted Beverly Boulevard a sad sight only three days\r\nbefore, what can I say about my impression of the city's nerve center in\r\nits last hours? Abandoned automobiles stood in the streets at the spot\r\nwhere they had run out of gas or some minor mechanical failure had\r\nhalted them. Dead streetcars, like big game stopped short by the\r\nhunter's bullet, stayed where the failure of electricpower caught them.\r\nThe tall buildings reeked of desertion as if their emptying had dulled\r\nsome superficial gloss and made them dim and colorless.\r\n\r\nBut contrast the dying city with the wall of living green, north, west,\r\nand south, towering ever higher and preparing to carry out the sentence\r\nalready passed, and the victim becomes insignificant in the presence of\r\nthe executioner. I was reminded of the well where Gootes died for here\r\nexcept on one small side the grass rose like the inside of a stovepipe\r\nto the sky; but I suffered neither the same despair nor the\r\nunaccountable elation I had upon that hill, perhaps because the trough\r\nwas so much bigger or because the animate thing was not beneath my feet\r\nto communicate those feelings directly.\r\n\r\nThere had evidently been some looting, not so much from greed as from\r\nthe natural impulse of human nature to steal and act lawlessly as soon\r\nas police vigilance is relaxed. Here and there stores were opened\r\nnakedly to the street, their contents spilled about. But such scenes\r\nwere surprisingly rare, the hopelessness of transporting stolen or any\r\nother possessions acting as a greater deterrent than morality. One way\r\nor another, as the saying has it, crime does not pay.\r\n\r\nFew people were visible and these were divided sharply into two\r\ncategories: those clearly intent upon concluding some business, rushing\r\nfuriously, papers, briefcases or articles of worth in their hands; and\r\nthose obviously without purpose, dazed, listless, stumbling against the\r\ncurbstones as they shambled along, casting furtive glances toward the\r\ngreen glacier in the background.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper office contained only people of the first type. Le ffaçasé\r\nhad come out of his sanctuary for the first time within memory of\r\nanybody on the staff. Still collarless, snuffbox in hand, he\r\nnapoleonically directed the removal of those valuables without which the\r\nnewspaper could not continue. He was cool, efficient, seemed to have\r\neyes everywhere and know everything going on in the entire building. He\r\nspent neither greetings nor reproaches on me, indeed was not looking in\r\nmy direction but somehow sensed my presence through his back, for he\r\nsaid without turning round, \"Weener, if you have concluded your\r\nunaccountable peregrinations remove the two files marked E1925 and E1926\r\nto Pomona. If you mislay one scrap of paper they contain--the bartering\r\nof a thousand Weeners being an inadequate equivalent--your miserable\r\nsubstance will be attached to four tractors headed in divergent\r\ndirections. Don't come back here, but attempt for once to palliate the\r\noffense of your birth and go interview that Francis female. Interview\r\nher, not yourself. Bring back a story, complete and terse, or commit the\r\nfirst sensible act of your life with any weapon you choose and charge\r\nthe instrument to the _Intelligencer_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I havent the slightest idea where Miss Francis is to be found.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a pinch of snuff, issued orders to four or five other people and\r\ncontinued calmly, \"I am not conducting a school of journalism; if I were\r\nI should have a special duncecap imported solely for your use. The\r\nlowest copyboy knows better than to utter such an inanity. You will find\r\nthe Francis and interview her. I'm busy. Get the hell out of here and\r\nhandle those files carefully if you value that cadaver you probably\r\nthink of as the repository of your soul.\"\r\n\r\nI am not a drayman and I resented the menial duty of sliding those heavy\r\nfilecases down four flights of stairs; but at a time like this, I\r\nthought philosophically, a man has duties he cannot shirk; besides, Le\r\nffaçasé was old, I could afford to humor him even if it meant demeaning\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nWith one of the cases in back, I sadly regarded the other one occupying\r\nmost of the front seat. If she had at least given me her name I would\r\nhave searched and searched until I found her. This train of thought\r\nreminded me of Le ffaçasé's command to find Miss Francis and so I\r\nconcentrated my attention on getting away from the _Intelligencer_\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt was no light labor; the stalled streetcars and automobiles presented\r\ngrave hazards to the unwary. The air smelt of death, and nervously I\r\npressed the accelerator to get away quickly from this tomb. I crossed\r\nthe dry riverbed and made my way slowly to Pomona, delivered the files,\r\nand reluctantly began seeking Miss Francis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_28._ It was practically impossible to discover any one person among so\r\nmany scattered and disorganized people, but chance aided my native\r\nintelligence and perseverance. Only the day before she had been involved\r\nwith an indignant group of the homeless who attributed their misfortunes\r\nto her and overcoming their natural American chivalry toward the weaker\r\nsex had tried to revenge themselves. I was therefore able to locate her,\r\nnot ten miles from the temporary headquarters of the _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_.\r\n\r\nHer laboratory was an abandoned chickenhouse which must have reminded\r\nher constantly of her lost kitchen. She looked almost jaunty as she\r\ngreeted me, a cobweb from the roof of the decaying shed caught in her\r\nhair. \"I have no profitable secrets to market, Weener--youre wasting\r\nyour time with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not here as a salesman, Miss Francis,\" I said. \"The _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_ would like to tell its readers how you are getting on\r\nwith your search for some cure for the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk as if _Cynodon dactylon_ were a disease. There is no cure for\r\nlife but death.\"\r\n\r\nSince she was going to be so touchy about the grass--as if it were a\r\npersonal possession--(why, I thought, it's as much mine as hers)--I\r\nsubstituted a more diplomatic form of words.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have made an interesting discovery,\" she conceded grudgingly\r\nand pointed to a row of flowerpots, her eyes lighting as she scanned the\r\nsingle blades of grass perhaps an inch and a half high growing in each.\r\nThe sight meant nothing to me and she must have gathered as much from my\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"_Cynodon dactylon_,\" she explained, \"germinated from seeds borne by the\r\ninoculated plant. Obviously the omnivorous capacity has not been\r\ntransmitted to offspring.\"\r\n\r\nThis was probably fascinating to her or a gardener or botanist, but I\r\ncouldnt see how it concerned me or the _Daily Intelligencer_.\r\n\r\n\"It could be a vitamin deficiency,\" she muttered incomprehensibly, \"or\r\nevasion of the laws regarding compulsory education. These plants\r\nindicate the affected grass may propagate its abnormal condition only\r\nthrough the extension of the already changed stolons or rhizomes. It\r\nmeans that only the parent, which is presumably not immortal, is\r\naberrant. The offspring is no different from the weed householders have\r\nbeen cursing ever since the Mission Fathers enslaved the Digger\r\nIndians.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" I exclaimed, suddenly enlightened, \"all we have to do is\r\nwait until the grass dies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or until it meets some insuperable object,\" supplemented Miss Francis.\r\n\r\nMy faith in insuperable objects had been somewhat shaken. \"How long do\r\nyou think it will be before the grass dies?\" I asked her.\r\n\r\nShe regarded me gravely, as though I had been a child asking an absurd\r\nquestion. \"Possibly a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nMy enthusiasm was dampened. But after leaving her I remembered how\r\ncertain types of people always look for the dark side of things. It\r\ncosts no more to be an optimist than a pessimist; it is sunshine grows\r\nflowers, not clouds; and if Miss Francis chose to think the grass might\r\nlive a thousand years, I was equally free to think it might die next\r\nweek. Thus heartened by this bit of homely philosophy, just as valid as\r\nany of the stuff entombed in wordy books, I wrote up my interview,\r\ncareful to guide myself by all the stifling strictures and adjurations\r\nimpressed upon me by the tyrannically narrowminded editor. If I may\r\nanticipate the order of events, it appeared next day in almost\r\nrecognizable form under the heading, ABNORMAL GRASS TO DIE SOON, SAYS\r\nORIGINATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_29._ The small city of Pomona was swollen to boomtown size by the\r\nexcursion there of so many enterprises forced from Los Angeles. Ordinary\r\ncitizens without heavy responsibilities when uprooted thought only of\r\nputting as much distance as possible between themselves and their\r\npersecutor; but the officials, the industrialists, the businessmen, the\r\nstaffs of great newspapers hovered close by, like small boys near the\r\nknothole in the ballpark fence from which theyd been banished by an\r\nofficious cop.\r\n\r\nThe _Intelligencer_ was lodged over the printshop of a local tributary\r\nwhich had agreed to the ousting with the most hypocritical assurances of\r\njoy at the honor done them and payment--in the smallest possible\r\ntype--by the addition to the great newspaper's masthead of the words,\r\n\"And Pomona _Post-Telegram_.\"\r\n\r\nPacked into this inadequate space were the entire staff and files of the\r\nmetropolitan daily. No wonder the confusion obviated all possibility of\r\nnormal routine. In addition, the disruption of railroad schedules made\r\nthe delivery of mail a hazard rather than a certainty. Perhaps this was\r\nwhy, weeks after they were due, it was only upon my return from\r\ninterviewing Miss Francis I received my checks from the _Weekly\r\nRuminant_ and the _Honeycomb_.\r\n\r\nIt may have been the boomtown atmosphere I have already mentioned or\r\nbecause at the same time I got my weekly salary; at any event, moved by\r\nan unaccountable impulse I took the two checks to a barbershop where,\r\nperhaps incongruously, a wellknown firm of Los Angeles stockbrokers had\r\nquartered themselves. I forced the checks upon a troubledlooking\r\nindividual--too taciturn to be mistaken for the barber--and mumbling,\r\n\"Buy me all the shares of Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates\r\nthis will cover,\" hurried out before sober thought could cause me to\r\nchange my mind.\r\n\r\nFor certainly this was no investment my cool judgment would approve, but\r\nthe wildest hunch, causing me to embark on what was no less than a\r\nspeculation. I went back to the desk I shared with ten others, bitterly\r\nregretting the things I might have bought with the money and berating\r\nmyself for my rashness. Only the abnormal pressure of events could have\r\nmade me yield to so irrational an impulse.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime things happened fast. Barely had the tardiest\r\n_Intelligencer_ employees got away when the enveloping jaws of the weed\r\nclosed tight, catching millions of dollars' worth of property within.\r\nThe project to bomb the grass out of existence, dormant for some weeks,\r\ncould no longer be denied.\r\n\r\nEven its most ardent advocates, however, now conceded reluctantly that\r\nordinary explosives would be futile--more than futile, an assistance to\r\nthe growth by scattering the propagating fragments. For the first time\r\npeople began talking openly of using the outlawed atomicbomb.\r\n\r\nThe instant response to this suggestion was an overwhelming opposition.\r\nThe President, Congress, the Army, Navy and public opinion generally\r\nagreed that the weapon was too terrible to use in so comparatively\r\ntrivial a cause.\r\n\r\nBut the machinery for some type of bombing had been set in motion and\r\nhad to be used. The fuel was stored, the airfields jammed, all available\r\nplanes, new, old, obsolescent and obsolete assembled, and for three days\r\nand nights the great fleets shuttled backandforth over the jungled area,\r\ndropping thousands of tons of incendiary bombs. Following close behind,\r\nstill more planes dropped cargoes of fuel to feed the colossal bonfire.\r\n\r\nInverted lightning flashes leapt upward, and after them great, rolling\r\nwhite, yellow, red and blue flames. The smoke, the smell of roasting\r\nvegetation, the roar and crackle of the conflagration, and the heat\r\nengendered were all noticeable as far away as Capistrano and Santa\r\nBarbara.\r\n\r\nDown from the sky, through the surface of the grass, the incendiaries\r\nburned great patches clear to the earth. The weed, which had resisted\r\nfire so contemptuously before, suddenly became inflammable and burned\r\nlike celluloid for days. Miles of twisted stems, cleaned of blade and\r\nlife, exposed tortured nakedness to aerial reconnoiter. Bald spots the\r\nsize of villages appeared, black and smoldering; the shape of the mass\r\nwas altered and altered again, but when, long after, the last spark\r\nflickered out and the last ember grew dull, the grass itself, torn and\r\ninjured, but not defeated or even noticeably beaten back, remained. It\r\nhad been a brilliant performance--and an ineffective one.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the incendiary bombing not only produced ruefully\r\ntriumphant Itoldyousos from disgruntled and doubly outraged\r\npropertyowners, but a new crop of bids for the _Intelligencer_'s reward\r\nto the developer of a saving agent. From suggested emigrations to Mars\r\nand giant magnifying glasses set up to wither the grass with the aid of\r\nthe sun, they ranged to projects for cutting a canal clear around the\r\nweed from San Francisco Bay to the Colorado River and letting the\r\nPacific Ocean do the rest. Another solution envisaged shutting off all\r\nlight from the grass by means of innumerable radiobeams to interrupt the\r\nsun's rays in the hope that with an inability to manufacture chlorophyll\r\nan atrophy would set in. Several contestants urged inoculating other\r\ngrasses, such as bamboo, with the Metamorphizer, expecting the two\r\ngiants of vegetation, like the Kilkenny cats, would end by devouring\r\neach other. This proposal received such wide popular support there is\r\nreason to believe it got some serious consideration in official\r\nquarters, but it was eventually abandoned on the ground that while it\r\ngave only a single slim chance of success it certainly doubled the\r\npotential growths to contend with. The analogy of a backfire in forest\r\nconflagrations was deemed poetic but inapplicable.\r\n\r\nMore comparatively prosaic courses included walling in the grass with\r\nconcrete; the Great Wall of China was the only work of man visible from\r\nthe moon; were Americans to let backward China best them? A concrete\r\nwall only a mile high and half a mile thick could be seen by any curious\r\nastronomer on the planet Venus--assuming Venerians to be afflicted with\r\nterrestrial vices--and would cost no more than a very small war, to say\r\nnothing of employing thousands who would otherwise dissipate the\r\ntaxpayers' money on Relief. A variant of this plan was to smother the\r\nweed with tons of dry cement and sand from airplanes; the rainy season,\r\ndue to begin in a few months, would add the necessary water and the\r\ngrass would then be encased in a presumably unbreakable tomb.\r\n\r\nBut the most popular suggestion embodied the use of salt, ordinary table\r\nsalt. From their own experience in backyard and garden, eager men and\r\nwomen wrote in urging this common mineral be used to end the menace of\r\nthe grass. \"It will Kill ennything,\" wrote an Imperial Valley farmer.\r\n\"Its lethal effect on plantlife is instantaneous,\" agreed a former\r\nBeverly Hills resident. \"I know there is not anything like Salt to\r\ndestroy Weeds\" was part of a long and rambling letter on blueruled\r\ntabletpaper, \"In the June of 1926 or 7 I cannot remember exactly it may\r\nhave been 28 I accidentally dropped some Salt on a beautiful\r\nPlumbago....\"\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to spray the surface, to drive tunnels through the roots\r\nto conduct brine, to bombard sectors with sixteeninch guns firing\r\nshrapnel loaded with salt, to isolate by means of a wide saline band the\r\nwhole territory, both occupied and threatened. Salt enthusiasts argued\r\nthat nothing except a few million tons of an inexpensive mineral would\r\nbe wasted if an improbable failure occurred, but if successful in\r\nstopping the advance the country could wait safely behind its rampart\r\ntill some weapon to regain the overrun area was found.\r\n\r\nBut the salt advocates didnt have everything their own way. There arose\r\na bitter antisalt faction taking pleasure at hurling sneers at these\r\noptimistic predictions and delight in demolishing the arguments. Miss\r\nFrancis, they said, who ought to know more about it than anyone else,\r\nclaimed the grass would break down even the most stable compound and\r\ntake what it needed. Well, salt was a compound, wasnt it? If the prosalt\r\nfanatics had their way they would just be offering food to a hungry\r\nplant. The salt supporters asked what proof Miss Francis had ever\r\nadvanced that the plant absorbed everything or indeed that her\r\nMetamorphizer had anything to do with metabolism and had not merely\r\ninduced some kind of botanical giantism? The antisalts, jeering at their\r\nenemies as Salinists and Salinites, promptly threw away Miss Francis'\r\nhypothetical support and relied instead on the proposition that if the\r\nsalt were to be efficacious--an unlikely contingency--it would have to\r\nreach the roots and if crudeoil, poured on when the plant was young, had\r\nnot done so what possible hope could the prosalt cranks offer for their\r\npanacea now the rampant grass was grown to its present proportions?\r\n\r\nThe salt argument cut society in half. Learned doctors battled in the\r\ncolumns of scientific journals. Businessmen dictated sputtering letters\r\nto their secretaries. Housewives wrote newspapers or argued heatedly in\r\nthe cornergrocery. Radiocommentators cautiously skirted the edge of\r\ncontroversy and more than one enthusiast had to be warned by his\r\nsponsor. Fistfights started in taverns over the question and judicious\r\nbartenders served beer without offering the objectionable seasoning with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe _Intelligencer_, at the start, was vehemently antisalt. \"Is there an\r\nAmerican Cato,\" Le ffaçasé asked, \"to call for the final ignominy\r\nsuffered by Carthage to be applied, not to the land of an enemy, but to\r\nour own?\" Shortly after this editorial, entitled \"Carthage, California\"\r\nappeared, the _Intelligencer_ swung to the opposite side and Le ffaçasé\r\noffered the prosalt argument under the heading \"Lot's Wife.\"\r\n\r\nThe Daughters of the American Revolution declared themselves in favor of\r\nsalt and refused the use of Constitution Hall to an antisalt meeting.\r\nStung, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist party circulated\r\na manifesto declaring the use of salt was an attempt to encircle, not\r\nthe grass, for that was a mere subterfuge of imperialism, but the Soviet\r\nUnion; and called upon all its peripheral fringe to write their\r\ncongressmen and demonstrate against the saline project. From India the\r\naged Mohandas Gandhi asked in piping tones why such a valuable adjunct\r\nwas to be wasted in rich America while impoverished ryots paid a harsh\r\ntax on this necessity of life? And the Council of Peoples' Commissars,\r\ncareless of the action of the American Stalinists, offered to sell the\r\nUnited States all its surplus salt. The herringpicklers of Holland\r\nstruck in a body while the American salt refiners bid as one to produce\r\non a costplus basis.\r\n\r\nThis last was a clincher and the obscurantic antisalts received the\r\ndeathblow they richly deserved. The Communist party reversed themselves\r\nswiftly. All respectable and patriotic people lined up behind salt. With\r\nsuch popular unanimity apparent, the government could do no less than\r\ntake heed. A band twenty miles wide, stretching from Oceanside to the\r\nSalton Sea, from the Salton Sea to the little town of Mojave and from\r\nthere to Ventura, was marked out on maps to be saltsown by the very same\r\nbombercommand which had dropped the spectacular but futile incendiaries.\r\nThe triumph of the salt people was ungenerous in its enthusiasm; the\r\ndisgruntled antisalts, now a mere handful of diehards publishing an\r\nesoteric press, muttered everyone would be sorry, wait and see.\r\n\r\n\r\n_30._ The grass itself waited for nothing. It seemed to take new\r\nstrength from the indignities inflicted upon it and it increased, if\r\nanything, its tempo of growth. It plunged into the ocean in a dozen\r\nspots at once. It swarmed over sand which had never known anything but\r\ncactus and the Sierra Madres became great humps of green against the\r\nskyline. This last conquest shocked those who had thought the mountains\r\nimmune in their inhospitable heights. _Cynodon dactylon_, uninoculated,\r\nhad always shunned coldness, though it survived some degrees of frost.\r\nThe giant growth, however, seemed to be less subject to this inhibition,\r\nthough it too showed slower progress in the higher and colder regions.\r\nThe _Intelligencer_ planned to move from Pomona to San Bernardino and if\r\nnecessary to Victorville.\r\n\r\nDaily Le ffaçasé became a sterner taskmaster, a more pettishly exacting\r\nemployer. By the living guts of William Lloyd Garrison, he raged, had no\r\none ever driven the simple elements of punctuation into my bloody head?\r\nHad no schoolmaster in moments of heroic enthusiasm attempted to pound a\r\nfew rules of rhetoric through my incrassate skull? Had I never heard of\r\ntaste? Was the word \"style\" outside my macilent vocabulary? What the\r\ndevil did I mean by standing there with my mouth open, exposing my\r\nunfortunate teeth for all the world to see? Was it possible for any\r\nallegedly human to be as addlepated as I? And had I been thrust from my\r\nmother's womb--I suppress his horrible adjectives--only to torment and\r\nafflict his longsuffering editorial patience?\r\n\r\nA hundred times I was tempted to sever my connection with this\r\njournalistic autocrat. My column was widely read and two\r\npublishinghouses had approached me with the idea of putting out a book,\r\nany editorial revision and emendations to be taken care of by them\r\nwithout disturbing me at all. I could have allied myself with almost any\r\npaper in the country, undoubtedly at better than the meager stipend Le\r\nffaçasé doled out to me.\r\n\r\nBut I think loyalty is one of the most admirable of virtues and it was\r\nnot in my nature to desert the _Intelligencer_--certainly not till I\r\ncould secure a lengthy and ironclad contract, such as for some reason\r\nother papers seemed unwilling to offer me. In accord with this innate\r\nloyalty of mine--I take no credit for it, I was born that way--I did not\r\nbalk at the assignments given me though they ranged from the hazardous\r\nto the absurd.\r\n\r\nOne of the more pleasant of these excursions thought up by Mr Le\r\nffaçasé was to fly over the grass and to Catalina, embark on a chartered\r\nboat there and survey the parts of the coast now overrun. A fresh point\r\nof observation. Accompanying me was the moviecameraman, Rafe Slafe, as\r\nuncommunicative and earnest in his medications as before.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad sight to see neat rectangular patterns of roads and\r\nhighways, cultivated fields and orangegroves, checkered towns and\r\nsprawling suburbs come to an abrupt stop where they were blotted out by\r\nthe regimented uniformity of the onrushing grass. For miles we flew\r\nabove its dazzling green until our eyes ached from the sameness and our\r\nminds were dulled from the lack of variety below. On the sea far ahead a\r\nfrothing whitecap broke the monotony of color, a flyingfish jumped out\r\nof the water to glisten for a moment in the sun, loose seaweed floated\r\non the surface, to change in some degree the intense blue. But here\r\nbelow no alien touch lightened the unnatural homogeneity. No solitary\r\ntree broke this endless pasture, now healed of the wounds inflicted by\r\nthe incendiary bombing, no saltlick, wandering stream or struggling bush\r\nenlivened this prairie. There was not even an odd conformation, a higher\r\nclump here or there, a dead patch to relieve the unimaginative symmetry.\r\nI have read of men going mad in solitary confinement from looking at the\r\nsame unchanging walls; well, here was a solitary cell hundreds of miles\r\nin area and its power to destroy the mind was that much magnified.\r\n\r\nI got little consolation from the presence of the others, for the pilot\r\nwas engaged in navigation while Slafe was, as ever, singlemindedly\r\nrecording mile after mile of the verdant mat beneath, never pausing nor\r\nspeaking, though how he justified the use of so much film when one foot\r\nwas identical with what went before and the next, I could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAt last we cleared the awful cancer and flew over the sea. A thousand\r\nvariations I had never noticed before offered themselves to my suddenly\r\nrefreshed eyes. Not for one split second was the water the same.\r\nLeaping, tossing, spiraling, foaming back upon itself, making its own\r\nshadows and mirroring in an infinitely faceted glass the sunlight, it\r\nchanged so constantly it was impossible to grasp even a fraction of its\r\nmutations. But Slafe evidently did not share my blessed relief, for he\r\nturned his camera back to catch every last glimpse of the solid green I\r\nwas so happy to leave behind.\r\n\r\nAt the airport, on the way to the boat, on the little vessel itself, I\r\nexpected Slafe to relax, to indulge in a conversational word, to do\r\nsomething to mark him as more than an automaton. But his actions were\r\nconfined to using the nasalsyringe, to exchanging one camera for\r\nanother, to quizzing the sun through that absurd lorgnette, and to\r\nmuttering over cans of film which he sorted and resorted, always to his\r\ninevitable discontent.\r\n\r\nWhile we waited to start, a perverse fog rolled between us and the\r\nmainland. It made a dramatic curtain over the object of our visit and\r\nemphasized the normality and untouchedness of Avalon behind us. As the\r\nboat got under way, strain my eyes as I could eastward, not the faintest\r\nsuggestion of the ominous outline showed. We sped toward it, cutting the\r\npurple sea into white foam. Slafe was in the bow, customarily taciturn,\r\nthe crew were busy. Alone on board I had no immediate occupation and so\r\nI took out my copy of the _Intelligencer_ and after reading the column\r\nwhich went under my name and noting the incredible bad taste which had\r\ndiluted when it had not excluded everything I had written, I turned as\r\nfor consolation to the marketquotations. The Dow-Jones average was down\r\nagain, as might be expected since the spread of the weed had unsettled\r\nthe delicate balance of the stockmarket. My eyes automatically ran down\r\nthe column and over to the corner where stocks were quoted in cents to\r\nreassure my faith in Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates.\r\nThere it was, immovable through any storm or stress or injudicious\r\ninvestment by Albert Weener, \"CP&AC ... 1/16.\"\r\n\r\nI must have raised my eyes from the newspaper just about the time the\r\nfog lifted. Before us, like the smokewreath accompanying the discharge\r\nof some giant cannon, the green mass volleyed into the sea. It did not\r\nslope gently like a beach or offer a rugged shoulder to be gnawed away\r\nas a rocky cliff, but thundered forward into the surging brine, yielding\r\nbut invincible, a landforce potent as the wave itself. Hundreds of feet\r\ninto the air it towered, falling abruptly in a sharp wall, its ends and\r\nfringes merging with the surf and wallowing in happy freedom. The\r\nbreakers did not batter it for it offered them no enmity to rage and\r\nboil upon, but giving way with each surge, smothered the eternal anger\r\nof the ocean with its own placid surety.\r\n\r\nThe seagulls, the helldivers, pelicans, seapigeons had not been\r\naffected. Resting briefly on the weed, they winged out for their food\r\nand returned. It mattered no more to them that the manmade piers and\r\nwharves, the seacoast towns, gypjoints, rollercoasters, whorehouses,\r\ncottages, hotels, streets, gastanks, quarries, potterykilns, oilfields\r\nand factories had been swallowed up than if some old wreck in the sand,\r\nonce offering them foothold, had been taken back by the sea. If I\r\nthought the grass awesome from the land, monotonous from the air, it\r\nseemed eternal from the water.\r\n\r\nBut impressive as it was from any angle, there were just so many things\r\nI could say about it. My art, unlike Slafe's, not permitting of endless\r\nrepetition, I was glad to get back to the Pomona office, to pad what\r\nlittle copy I had, retire into the small tent I shared with six other\r\nsufferers from the housing shortage, and attempt some sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n_31._ The course mapped for the saltband caused almost as much\r\ncontroversy, anguish and denunciation as the proposal itself. Cities and\r\ntowns fought to have the saltband laid between them and the approaching\r\ngrass, understandably ignoring larger calculations and considerations.\r\nCattle ranchers shot at surveying parties and individual farmers or\r\nhomeowners fought against having their particular piece of property\r\ncovered with salt. The original plan had contemplated straight lines;\r\neventually the band twisted and turned like a typewriter ribbon plagued\r\nby a kitten, avoiding not only natural obstacles, but the domains of\r\nthose with proper influence.\r\n\r\nRecovery plants worked three shifts a day to pile up great mounds of the\r\nwhite crystals, which were hauled to the airfields by trains and trucks.\r\nThe laden trucks moved over the highways bumper to bumper; the\r\nfreighttrains' engines nosed the cabooses of those in front. All other\r\ngoods were shunted on sidings, perishables rotted, valuables went\r\nundelivered; all transportation was reserved for the salt.\r\n\r\nNot only was the undertaking unprecedented for its magnitude, but the\r\nurgency and the breakdowns, bottlenecks, shortages and disruptions\r\ncaused by the grass itself added to the formidable accomplishment. But\r\nthe people were aroused and aware of danger, and they put almost the\r\nsame effort behind the saltsowing as they would have in turning out\r\ninstruments of war.\r\n\r\nThe sowing itself was in a way anticlimactic. By the whim of Le ffaçasé\r\nI went in one of the planes on the first day of the task. My protests,\r\nas always, proving futile, I spent a very boresome time flying\r\nbackandforth over the same patch of ground. That is, it would have been\r\nboresome had it not been for the dangers involved, for in order to sow\r\nthe salt evenly and thickly it was necessary to fly low, to hedgehop,\r\nthe pilot called it. If the parachutejump had unnerved me, the flying at\r\nterrific speed straight toward a tree, hill or electricpowerline and\r\nthen curving upward at the last second to miss them by a whisper must\r\nhave put gray in my hair and taken years from my life.\r\n\r\nThe rivers, washes and creeks on the inner edge had been roughly dammed\r\nto lessen future erosion of the salt and inappropriately gay flags\r\nmarked the boundaries of the area. Owing to our speed the salt billowed\r\nout behind us like powdery fumes, but beyond the evidence of this smoky\r\ntrail we might merely have been a group of madmen confusedly searching\r\nfor some object lost upon the ground.\r\n\r\nIn reporting for the _Intelligencer_ it was impossible to dramatize the\r\nevent; even the rewritemen were baffled, for under the enormous head\r\nSALT SOWN they could not find enough copy to carry over from page one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_32._ The sowing of the salt went on for weeks, and the grass leaped\r\nforward as if to meet it. It raced southward through Long Beach, Seal\r\nBeach and the deserted dunes to Newport and Balboa; it came east in a\r\nfury through Puente and Monrovia, northeastward it moved into Lancaster,\r\nSimi and Piru. Only in its course north did the weed show a slower pace;\r\nby the time we had been forced to leave Pomona for San Bernardino it had\r\ngot no farther than Calabasas and Malibu.\r\n\r\nThe westward migration of the American people was abruptly reversed.\r\nThose actually displaced by the grass infected others, through whose\r\nhomes they passed in their flight, with their own panic. Land values\r\nwest of the Rockies dropped to practically nothing and the rich farms of\r\nthe Great Plains were worth no more than they had been a hundred years\r\nbefore. People had seen directly, heard over the radio, or read in\r\nnewspapers of the countless methods vainly used to stop the grass and\r\nthere was little confidence in the saltband's succeeding where other\r\ndevices had failed. True, there were hereandthere individuals or whole\r\nfamilies or even entire communities obstinate enough to scorn flight,\r\nbut in the opinion of most they were like pigheadedly trustful peasants\r\nwho cling, in the face of all warning, to homes on the slopes of an\r\nactive volcano.\r\n\r\nIt was generally thought the government itself, in creating the\r\nsaltband, was making no more than a gesture. Whatever the validity of\r\nthis pessimism, the work itself was impressive. Viewed from high in the\r\nair only a month after the start it was already visible; after two\r\nmonths it was a thick, glistening river winding over mountain, desert,\r\nand what had been green fields, a white crystalline barrier behind which\r\nthe country waited nervously.\r\n\r\nWhen the salt had been first proposed, batches had been dumped in\r\nproximity to the grass, but the quantity had been too small to\r\ndemonstrate any conclusion and observers had been immediately driven\r\nfrom the scene of the experiments by the grass.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the very inclusiveness of these trials confirmed the\r\ndoubts of the waiting country as the narrow gap before the salt was\r\nclosed and the weed rolled to it near Capistrano. I would like to think\r\nof the meeting as dramatic, heightened by inaudible drumrolls and\r\nflashes of invisible lightning. Actually the conflict was pedestrian.\r\n\r\nManipulated once more by my tyrant, I was stationed, like other\r\nreporters and radiomen, in a captive balloon. For the utmost in\r\ndiscomfort and lack of dignity let me recommend this ludicrous\r\ninvention. Cramped, seasickened, inconvenienced--I don't like to mention\r\nthis, but provisions for answering the calls of nature were, to say the\r\nleast, inadequate--I swayed and rocked in that inconsiderable basket,\r\nchilled, blinded by the dazzle of the salt, knocked about by gusts of\r\nirresponsible wind, and generally disgusted by the uselessness of my\r\npursuit. A telescope to the eye and constant radioreports from shuttling\r\nplanes told of the approaching grass, but under the circumstances\r\nweariness rather than excitement or anxiety was the prevailing emotion.\r\n\r\nAt last the collision came. The long runners, curiously flat from the\r\nair, pushed their way ahead. The salt seemed no more to them than bare\r\nground, concrete, vegetation, or any of the hundred obstacles they had\r\ntraveled. Unstutteringly the vinelike stolons went forward. A foot, two,\r\nsix, ten. No recoil, no hesitation, no recognition they were traversing\r\na wall erected against them.\r\n\r\nBehind these first outposts, the higher growth came on, and still\r\nfarther off the great bulk itself reared skyward, blotting out the\r\nhorizon behind, threatening, inexhaustible. It seemed to prod its\r\nprecursors, to demand hungrily ever more and more room to expand.\r\n\r\nBut the creeping of the runners over the first few feet of salt\r\ndwindled to a stop. This caused experienced observers like myself no\r\nelation; we had seen it happen many times before at the encountering of\r\nany novel obstacle, and its only effect had been to make the weed change\r\nits tactics in order to overcome the obstruction, as it did now. A\r\nsecond rank moved forward on top of the halted first, a third upon the\r\nsecond and so on till a living wall frowned down upon the salt, throwing\r\nits shadow across it for hundreds of ominous yards. It towered erect and\r\nthen, repeating the tactic invariably successful, it toppled forward to\r\ncreate a bridgehead from which to launch new assaults.\r\n\r\nThe next day new stolons emerged from the mass, but now for the first\r\ntime excitement seized us up in our bobbing post of observation. Not\r\nonly were the new runners visibly shorter in length but they crept\r\nforward more slowly, haltingly, as though hurt. This impression was\r\ngenerally discredited, people were surfeited with optimism; they felt\r\nour reports were wishful thinking. Their pessimism seemed to be\r\nconfirmed when the weed repeated its action of the day before, falling\r\nahead of itself upon the salt; and few took stock in our excited\r\nannouncements that the grass had covered only half the previous\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nAgain the probing fingers poked out, again the reserves piled up, again\r\nthe mass fell. But it fell far short of a normal leap. There could no\r\nlonger be any doubt about it; the advance had been slowed, almost\r\nstopped. The salt was working.\r\n\r\nEverywhere along the entire band the story was the same. The grass\r\nrushed confidently in, bit off great chunks, then smaller, then smaller,\r\nuntil its movement ceased entirely. That part which embedded itself in\r\nthe salt lost the dazzling green color so characteristic and turned\r\npiebald, from dirty gray through brown and yellow, an appearance so\r\nfamiliar in its normal counterpart on lawns and vacant lots.\r\n\r\nThe encircled area filled up and choked with the balked weed. Time after\r\ntime it essayed the deadly band, only to be thwarted. The glistening\r\nfortification, hardly battered, stood triumphant, imprisoning the\r\ninvader within. Commentators in trembling voices broke the joyful news\r\nover every receivingset and even the stodgiest newspapers brought out\r\ntheir blackest type to announce GRASS STOPPED!\r\n\r\n\r\n_33._ The President of the United States, as befitted a farmer knowing\r\nsomething of grasses on his own account, issued a proclamation of\r\nthanksgiving for the end of the peril which had beset the country. The\r\nstockmarket recovered from funereal depths and jumped upward. In all the\r\ngreat cities hysterical rapture so heated the blood of the people that\r\nall restraints withered. In frantic joy women were raped in the streets,\r\ndozens of banks were looted, thousands of plateglasswindows were smashed\r\nwhile millions of celebrants wept tears of 86 proof ecstasy. Torn\r\ntickertapes made Broadway impassable and the smallest whistlestops\r\nspontaneously revived the old custom of uprooting outhouses and perching\r\nthem on the church steeple.\r\n\r\nI had my own particular reason to rejoice coincident with the stoppage\r\nof the grass. It was so unreal, so dreamlike, that for many days I had\r\ntrouble convincing myself of its actuality. It began with a series of\r\nagitated telephone messages from a firm of stockbrokers asking for my\r\nimmediate presence, which because of my assignments, failed to reach me\r\nfor some time. So engrossed was I in the events surrounding the victory\r\nover the grass I could not conceive why any broker would want to see me\r\nand so put off my visit several times, till the urgency of the calls\r\nbegan to pique my curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe man who greeted me was runcible, with little strands of sickly hair\r\ntwisted mopwise over his bald head. His striped suit was rumpled, the\r\ncollar of his shirt was wrinkled, and dots of perspiration stood out on\r\nhis upperlip and forehead. \"Mr Weener?\" he asked. \"Oh, thank God, thank\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nCompletely at a loss, I followed him into his private office. \"You\r\nrecall commissioning us--when we were located in Pomona--to purchase\r\nsome shares of Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates for your\r\naccount?\"\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, while I had not forgotten the event, I had been\r\nsufficiently ashamed of my rashness to have pushed all recollection of\r\nthe transaction to the back of my mind. But I nodded confirmingly.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt you would be willing to sell at a handsome profit?\"\r\n\r\nAha, I thought, the rise of the market has sent Consolidated Pemmican up\r\nfor once beyond its usual 1/8. I am probably a rich man and this fellow\r\nwants to cheat me of the fruits of my foresight. \"You bought the stock\r\noutright?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, Mr Weener,\" he affirmed in a hurt tone.\r\n\r\n\"Good. Then I will take immediate delivery.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his lip and forehead with evident\r\ninefficiency for the perspiration either remained or started afresh. \"Mr\r\nWeener,\" he said, \"I am authorized to offer you six times--six times,\"\r\nhe echoed impressively, \"the amount of your original investment. This is\r\nan amazing return.\"\r\n\r\nIf it was worth it to him, it was worth it to me. \"I will take immediate\r\ndelivery,\" I repeated firmly.\r\n\r\n\"And no brokerage fees involved,\" he added, as one making an\r\nunbelievable concession.\r\n\r\nI shook my head.\r\n\r\n\"Mr Weener,\" he said, \"I have been empowered to make you an incredible\r\ntender for your stock. Not only will the boardofdirectors of\r\nConsolidated Pemmican return to you six times the amount of your\r\ninvestment, but they will assign to you, over and above this price, 49\r\npercent of the company's votingstock. It is a magnificent and\r\nunparalleled bid and I sincerely advise you to take it.\"\r\n\r\nI pressed my palms into the back of the chair. I, Albert Weener, was a\r\ncapitalist. The money involved already seemed negligible, for it was a\r\nmere matter of a few thousand dollars, but to own what amounted to a\r\ncontrolling interest, even in a defunct or somnolent corporation, made\r\nme an important person. Only a reflex made me gasp, \"I will take\r\nimmediate delivery.\"\r\n\r\nThe broker dropped his hands against his thighs. \"Mr Weener, you are an\r\nacute man. Mr Weener, I must confess the truth. You have bought more\r\nshares of Consolidated Pemmican than there are in existence; you not\r\nonly own the firm, lock, stock and barrel, but you owe yourself money.\"\r\nHe gave a weak laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Above and beyond this, Mr Weener, through an unfortunate series of\r\nevents due to the confusion of the times--without it, such an absurd\r\nsituation would never have occurred--several people: our own firm, our\r\nNew York correspondents, and the present heads of Consolidated Pemmican\r\nare liable to prosecution by the Securities Exchange Commission. We can\r\nonly throw ourselves on your mercy.\"\r\n\r\nI waved this aside magnanimously. \"Where is my property located?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe Consolidated Pemmican has an office in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but the factory, the works; where is the product made?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strictly speaking, I understand active operations ceased back in 1919.\r\nHowever, there is a plant somewhere in New Jersey, I think; I'll look it\r\nup for you.\"\r\n\r\nMy dream of wealth began fading as the whole situation became clear and\r\nsuspicions implicit in the peculiar behavior of the stock were\r\nconfirmed. The corporation had evidently fallen into the hands of\r\nunscrupulous promoters who manipulated for the small but steady \"take\"\r\nits fluctuations on the market afforded. Without attempting to operate\r\nthe factory, my reasoning ran, they had taken advantage of the stock's\r\nlow price to double whatever they cared to invest twice yearly. It was a\r\nneat and wellshaped little racket and discovery, as the broker admitted,\r\nwould have exposed them to legal action. Only my recklessness with the\r\nchecks from the _Weekly Ruminant_ and the _Honeycomb_ had broken the\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nBut ... they had offered me several thousand dollars, evidently in cold\r\ncash. Defunct or not, then, the business was presumably worth at least\r\nthat. And if they had employed the stock to maintain some sort of\r\nincome, why, I could certainly learn to do the same. I was an\r\nindependent man afterall.\r\n\r\nExcept for the slightly embarrassing detail of being without current\r\nfunds I was also free of Le ffaçasé and the _Daily Intelligencer_. \"Mr\r\nBlank,\" I said, \"I need some money for immediate expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew youd see things in a sensible light, Weener. I'll have your\r\ncheck in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"You misunderstand me. I have no intention of giving up any part of\r\nConsolidated Pemmican.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me intently. \"Mr. Weener, I am not a wealthy man. Above and\r\nbeyond that, since this grass business started, I assure you any common\r\nlaborer has made more money than I. Any common laborer,\" he repeated\r\nsadly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I only need about a thousand dollars for immediate outlays. Just\r\nwrite me a check for that much, like a good fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr Weener, how can we be sure you won't call upon us again for\r\nmore--ah--expensemoney?\"\r\n\r\nI drew myself up indignantly. \"Mr Blank, no one has ever questioned my\r\nintegrity before. When I say a thousand dollars is all the expensemoney\r\nI require, why, it is all the expensemoney I require. To doubt it is to\r\ninsult me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" I agreed.\r\n\r\nReluctantly he wrote the check and handed it to me. Then, more amicably,\r\nwe settled the details of the stock transfer and he gave me the location\r\nof my property. I went back to the _Intelligencer_ office with the\r\nspringy step of a man who acknowledges no master. In my mind I prepared\r\na triumph: I would wait--even if it took days--for the first bullying\r\nword from Le ffaçasé and then I would magnificently fling my resignation\r\nin his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n_34._ When the grass was thought to be invincible, Miss Francis, as the\r\ndiscoverer of the compound which started it on its course, was the\r\nrecipient of a universal if grudging respect. Those whom the grass had\r\nmade homeless hated her and would have overcome their natural feeling of\r\nprotection toward a woman sufficiently to lynch her if they could. Men\r\nlike Senator Jones instinctively disliked her; others, like Dr Johnson,\r\ndetested her, but no one thought of her lightly, even when they glibly\r\ncoupled the word nut with her name.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found the saltband worked Miss Francis immediately became\r\nthe butt of all the ridicule and contumely which could be heaped upon\r\nher head. What could you expect of a woman who meddled with things\r\noutside her province? Since she had asserted the grass would absorb\r\neverything, its failure to absorb the salt proved beyond all doubt she\r\nwas an ignoramus, a dangerous charlatan, and a crazy woman, better\r\nlocked up, who had destroyed Southern California to her own obscure\r\nbenefit. The victory over the grass became a victory over Miss Francis;\r\nof the ordinary gumchewing moviegoing maninthestreet over the\r\npretentious highbrow. She was ignominiously ejected from her\r\nchickenhouse-laboratory on the ground that it was more needed for its\r\noriginal use, and she was jeered at in every vehicle of public\r\nexpression. In spite of my natural chivalry, I cannot say I pitied her\r\nin her fall, which she took with an unbecoming humility amounting to\r\narrogance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_35._ It was amazing how quickly viewpoints returned to an apparent\r\nnormality as soon as the grass stopped at the saltband. That it still\r\nexisted, in undisputed possession of nearly all Southern California\r\nafter dispersing and scattering millions of people all over the country,\r\ndisturbing by its very being a large part of the national economy, was\r\nonly something read in newspapers, an accepted fact to be pushed into\r\nthe farthest background of awareness, now the immediate threat was gone.\r\nThe salt patrol, vigilant for erosions or leachings, a select corps, was\r\nalert night and day to keep the saline wall intact. The general\r\nattitude, if it concerned itself at all with the events of the past half\r\nyear, looked upon it merely as one of those setbacks periodically\r\nafflicting the country like depressions, epidemics, floods, earthquakes,\r\nor other manmade or natural misfortunes. The United States had been a\r\ngreat nation when Los Angeles was a pueblo of five thousand people; the\r\nmovies could set up in business elsewhere, Iowans find another spot for\r\nsenescence, the country go on much as usual.\r\n\r\nOne of the first results of the defeat of the grass was the building,\r\nalmost overnight, it seemed, of a great city on the east bank of the\r\nSalton Sea. Displaced realtors from the metropolis found the surrounding\r\nmountains ideally suited for subdivision and laid out romantically named\r\nsuburbs large enough to contain the entire population of California\r\nbefore the site of the city had been completely surveyed. Beyond their\r\nclaims, the memorial parks, columbariums, homes of eternal rest and\r\nelysian lawns offered choice lots--with a special discount on\r\ncaskets--on the installmentplan. Magnificent brochures were printed, a\r\nskeletal biographical dictionary--$5 for notice, $50 for a\r\nportrait--planned, advertisements in leading magazines urged the\r\nmigration of industry: \"contented labor and all local taxes remitted for\r\nten years.\"\r\n\r\nThese essential preliminaries accomplished, the city itself was laid\r\nout, watermains installed, and paving and grading begun. It was no great\r\nfeat to divert the now aimless Colorado River aqueduct to the site nor\r\nto erect thousands of prefabricated houses. The climate was declared to\r\nbe unequalled, salubrious, equable, pleasant and bracing. Factories were\r\nerected, airports laid out, hospitals, prisons, and insane asylums\r\nbuilt. The Imperial and Coachella valleys shipped their products in at\r\nlow cost, and as a gesture to those who might suffer from homesickness\r\nit was called New Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in relief from the fear and despair so recently dispelled, New\r\nLos Angeles began to boom from the moment the mayor first handed the key\r\nto a passing distinguished visitor. It grew and spread as the grass had\r\ngrown and spread, the embryonic skeletons of its unborn skyline rivaled\r\nthe height of the green mass now triumphant in its namesake, presenting,\r\nas newsphotographers were quick to see, an aspect from the west not\r\nentirely dissimilar to Manhattan's.\r\n\r\nTo New Los Angeles, of course, the _Daily Intelligencer_ moved as soon\r\nas a tent large enough to house its presses could be set up. But I did\r\nnot move with it. For some reason, perhaps intuitively forewarned of my\r\nintention, Le ffaçasé never gave me the opportunity to humiliate him as\r\nI planned. On the contrary, I received from him, a few days before the\r\npaper's removal, a silly and characteristic note: \"Since the freak grass\r\nhas been stopped it seems indicated other abnormalities be terminated\r\nalso. Your usefulness to this paper, always debatable, is now clearly at\r\nan end. As of this moment your putative services will be no longer\r\nrequired. W.R.L.\"\r\n\r\nBitter vexation came over me at having lost the opportunity to give this\r\nbully a piece of my mind and my impulse was to go immediately to his\r\noffice and tell him I scorned his petty paycheck, but I reflected a man\r\nof his nature would merely find some tricky way of turning the interview\r\nto his malicious satisfaction and he would know soon enough it was the\r\npaper which was suffering a loss and not I.\r\n\r\nI started next morning and drove eastward toward my property, quite\r\nsatisfied to leave behind forever the scenes of my early struggles. The\r\nWest had given me only petty irritations. In the East, with its older\r\nculture and higher level of intelligence, I looked forward to having my\r\nworth appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR\r\n\r\n_Man Triumphant ... II_\r\n\r\n\r\n_36._ Everything I had visualized in the broker's office turned out too\r\npessimistically accurate. Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates\r\nwas nothing but a mailing address in one of the most forlorn of\r\nManhattan buildings, long before jettisoned by the tide of commerce. The\r\nfactory, no bigger than a very small house, was a brokenwindowed affair\r\nwhose solid brick construction alone saved it from total demolition at\r\nthe playful hands of the local children. The roof had long since fallen\r\nin and symbolical grass and weeds had pushed their way through cracks in\r\nthe floor to flourish in a sickly and surreptitious way.\r\n\r\nThe whole concern, until my stock purchase, had been the chattel and\r\ncreature of one Button Gwynnet Fles. In appearance he was such a genuine\r\nYankee, lean and sharp, with a slight stoop and prying eyes, that one\r\nquite expected a straw to protrude from between his thin lips or have\r\nhim draw from his pocket a wooden nutmeg and offer it for sale. After\r\ngetting to know him I learned this apparent shrewdness was a pure\r\ndefense mechanism, that he was really an artless and ingenuous soul who\r\nhad been taught by other hands the swindle he practiced for many years\r\nand had merely continued it because he knew no way of making an honest\r\nliving. He was, like myself, unattached, and disarmed whatever lingering\r\nsuspicions of him I might have by offering to share his quarters with me\r\nuntil I should have found suitable accommodations.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow was completely at my mercy and I not only forbore,\r\ngenerously, to press my advantage, but made him vicepresident of the\r\nnewly reorganized concern, permitting him to buy back a portion of the\r\nstock he had sold. The boom in the market having sent our shares up to\r\nan abnormal 1/2, we flooded our brokers with selling offers, at the same\r\ntime spreading rumors--by no means exaggerated--of the firm's\r\ninstability, buying back control when Consolidated Pemmican reached its\r\nnorm of 1/16. We made no fortunes on this transaction, but I was enabled\r\nto look ahead to a year on a more comfortable economic level than ever\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nBut it was by no means in my plans merely to continue to milk the\r\ncorporation. I am, I hope, not without vision, and I saw Consolidated\r\nPemmican under my direction turned into an active and flourishing\r\nindustry. Its very decrepitude, I reasoned, was my opportunity; starting\r\nfrom scratch and working with nothing, I would build a substantial\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nOne of the new businesses which had sprung up was that of personally\r\nconducted tours of the grass. After the experience of Gootes and myself,\r\nparachute landings had been ruled out as too hazardous, but someone\r\nhappily thought of the use of snowshoes and it was on these clumsy means\r\nthat tourists, at a high cost and at less than snail's pace, tramped\r\nwonderingly over the tamed menace.\r\n\r\nMy thought then, as I explained to Fles, was to reactivate the factory\r\nand sell my product to the sightseers. Food, high in calories and small\r\nin bulk, was a necessity on their excursions and nourishing pemmican\r\nhigh in protein quickly replaced the cloying and messy candybar. We made\r\nno profit, but we suffered no loss and the factory was in actual\r\noperation so that no snoopers could ever accuse us of selling stock in\r\nan enterprise with a purely imaginary existence.\r\n\r\nI liked New York; it accorded well with my temperament and I wondered\r\nhow I had ever endured those weary years far from the center of the\r\ncountry's financial life, its theaters and its great human drama. Give\r\nme the old Times Square and the East Fifties any day and you can keep\r\nDeath Valley and functional architecture. I was at home at last and I\r\nforesaw a future of slow but sure progress toward a position of\r\neminence and respectability. The undignified days of Miss Francis and Le\r\nffaçasé faded from my mind and I was aware of the grass only as a cause\r\nfor selling our excellent pemmican.\r\n\r\nI won't say I didnt read the occasional accounts of the weed appearing\r\nin _Time_ or the newspapers, or watch films of it in the movies with\r\nmore than common interest, but it was no longer an engrossing factor in\r\nmy life. I was now taken up with larger concerns, working furiously to\r\nexpand my success and for a year after leaving the _Intelligencer_ I\r\ndoubt if I gave it more than a minute's thought a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_37._ The band of salt remained an impregnable bulwark. Where the winter\r\nrains leached it, new tons of the mineral replaced those washed away.\r\nConstant observation showed no advance; if anything the edge of the\r\ngrass impinging directly on the salt was sullenly retreating. The\r\ncentral bulk remained, a vast, obstinate mass, but most people thought\r\nit would somehow end by consuming itself, if indeed this doom were not\r\nanticipated by fresh scatterings of salt striking at its vitals as soon\r\nas the rains ceased.\r\n\r\nNo more than any other reader, then, was I disquieted by the following\r\nsmall item in my morning paper:\r\n\r\n    FREAK WEED STIRS SPECULATION\r\n\r\n    San Diego, Mar 7. (AP) An unusual patch of Bermuda grass discovered\r\n    growing in one of the city parks' flower beds here today caused an\r\n    excited flurry among observers. Reaching to a height of nearly four\r\n    feet and defying all efforts of the park gardeners to uproot it, the\r\n    vivid green interloper reminded fearful spectators of the plague\r\n    which over ran Los Angeles two years ago. Scientists were\r\n    reassuring, however, as they pointed out that the giantism of the\r\n    Los Angeles devil grass was not transmissible by seed and that no\r\n    stolons or rhizomes of the abnormal plant had any means of traveling\r\n    to San Diego, protected as it is by the band of salt confining the\r\n    Los Angeles growth.\r\n\r\nI was even more confident, for I had seen with my own eyes the shoots\r\ngrown by Miss Francis from seeds of the inoculated plant. A genuine\r\nfreak, this time, I thought, and promptly forgot the item.\r\n\r\nWould have forgotten it, I should say, had I not an hour later received\r\na telegram, RETURN INSTANTLY CAN USE YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF NEW GRASS\r\nLEFFACASE. I knew from the fact he had only used nine of the ten words\r\npaid for he considered the situation serious.\r\n\r\nThe answer prompted by impulse would, I knew, not be transmitted by the\r\ntelegraph company and on second thought I saw no reason why I should not\r\ntake advantage of the editor's need. Business was slack and I was\r\noverworked; a succession of petty annoyances had driven me almost to a\r\nnervous breakdown and a vacation at the expense of the New Los Angeles\r\n_Daily Intelligencer_ sounded pleasantly restful after the serious work\r\nof grappling with industrial affairs. Of course I did not need their\r\npaltry few dollars, but at the moment some of my assets were frozen and\r\na weekly paycheck would be temporarily convenient, saving me the bother\r\nof liquidating a portion of my smaller investments.\r\n\r\nBesides, if, as was barely possible, this new growth was in some\r\nunbelievable way an extension of the old, it would of course ruin our\r\nsales of pemmican to the tourists and it behooved me to be on the spot.\r\nI therefore answered: CONSIDER DOUBLE FORMER SALARY WIRE TRANSPORTATION.\r\nNext day the great transcontinental plane pouterpigeoned along the\r\nrunway of the magnificent New Los Angeles airport.\r\n\r\nI was in no great hurry to see the editor, but took a taxi instead to\r\nthe headquarters of the American Alpinists Incorporated where there was\r\nfrank worry over the news and acknowledgment that no further\r\nconsignments of pemmican would be accepted until the situation became\r\nmore settled. I left their offices in a thoughtful mood. Pausing only to\r\nwire Fles to unload as much stock as he could--for even if this were\r\nonly a temporary scare it would undoubtedly affect the market--I finally\r\ndrove to the _Intelligencer_.\r\n\r\nKnowing Le ffaçasé I hardly expected to be received with either\r\ncordiality or politeness, but I was not quite prepared for the actual\r\nsalute. A replica of his original office had been devised, even to the\r\nshabby letters on the door, and he was seated in his chair beneath the\r\ngallery of cartoons. He began calmly enough when I entered, speaking in\r\na low, almost gentle tone, helping himself to snuff between sentences,\r\nbut gradually working up into a quite artistic crescendo.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Weener, as you yourself would undoubtedly put it in your inimitable\r\nway, a bad penny always turns up. I could not say _canis revertit suam\r\nvomitem_, for it would invert a relationship--the puke has returned to\r\nthe dog.\r\n\r\n\"It is a sad thought that the listless exercise which eventuated in your\r\nbegetting was indulged in by two whose genes and chromosomes united to\r\nproduce a male rather than a female child. For think, Weener, if you had\r\nbeen born a woman, with what gusto would you have peddled your flaccid\r\nflesh upon the city streets and offered your miserable dogsbody to the\r\nreluctant use of undiscriminating customers. You are the paradigmatic\r\nwhore, Weener, and I weep for the physiological accident which condemns\r\nyou to sell your servility rather than your vulva. Ah, Weener, it\r\nrestores my faith in human depravity to have you around to attempt your\r\npetty confidence tricks on me once more; I rejoice to find I had not\r\noverestimated mankind as long as I can see one aspect of it embodied in\r\nyour 'homely face and bad complexion,' as the great Gilbert so mildly\r\nput it. I shall give orders to triplelock the pettycash, to count the\r\nstampmoney diligently, to watch all checks for inept forgery. Welcome\r\nback to the _Intelligencer_ and be grateful for nature's mistakes, since\r\nthey afford you employment as well as existence.\r\n\r\n\"But enough of the friendly garrulousness of an old man whose powers are\r\nfailing. Remove your unwholesomelooking person from my sight and convey\r\nthe decrepit vehicle of your spirit to San Diego. It is but a gesture; I\r\nexpect no coherent words from your clogged and sputtery pen; but while I\r\nam sufficiently like yourself to deceive the public into thinking you\r\nhave written what they read, I am not yet great enough scoundrel to do\r\nso without your visiting the scene of your presumed labors. Go--and do\r\nnot stop on the way to draw expensemoney from the cashier for she has\r\nstrict orders not to pay it.\"\r\n\r\nJealousy, nothing but jealousy, I thought, first of my literary ability\r\nand now of my independence of his crazy whims. I turned my back\r\ndeliberately and walked slowly out, to show my contempt for his\r\nrantings.\r\n\r\nIn my heart, now, there was little doubt the new grass was an extension\r\nof the old and it didnt take more than a single look at the overrun park\r\nto confirm this. The same creeping runners growing perceptibly from\r\ninstant to instant, the same brilliant color, the same towering central\r\nmass gorged with food. I could have described it line by line and blade\r\nby blade in my sleep. I wasted no more time gazing at it, but hurried\r\naway after hardly more than a minute's inspection.\r\n\r\nI could take no credit for my perceptivity since everyone in San Diego\r\nknew as well as I that this was no duplicate freak, but the same, the\r\nidentical, the fearsome grass. But a quite understandable conspiracy had\r\nbeen tacitly entered into; the knowledge was successfully hushed until\r\nproperty could be disposed of before it became quite worthless. The\r\nconspiracy defeated itself, however, with so many frantic sellers\r\ncompeting against each other and the news was out by the time the first\r\nof my new columns appeared in the _Intelligencer_.\r\n\r\nThe first question which occurred to those of us calm enough to escape\r\npanic was, how had the weed jumped the saltband? It was answered\r\nsimultaneously by many learned professors whose desire to break into\r\nprint and share the front page with the terrible grass overcame their\r\nnatural academic reticence. There was no doubt that originally the\r\npeculiar voracity of the inoculated plant had not been inherited; but\r\nit was equally uncontroverted that somehow, during the period it had\r\nbeen halted by the salt, a mutation had happened and now every wind\r\nblowing over the weed carried seeds no longer innocent but bearing\r\nembryos of the destroyer.\r\n\r\nTerror ran before the grass like a herald. The shock felt when Los\r\nAngeles went down was multiplied tenfold. Now there was no predictable\r\ncourse men could shape their actions to avoid. No longer was it possible\r\nto watch and chart the daily advance of a single body so a partially\r\naccurate picture could be formed of what might be expected tomorrow.\r\nInstead of one mass there were countless ones; at the whim of a chance\r\nwind or bird, seeds might alight in an area apparently safe and\r\noverwhelm a community miles away from the living glacier. No place was\r\nout of range of the attack; no square foot of land kept any value.\r\n\r\nThe stockmarket crashed, and I congratulated myself on having sent Fles\r\norders to sell. A day or two later the exchanges were closed and,\r\nshortly after, the banks. Business came to a practical standstill. The\r\ngreat industries shut down and all normal transactions of daily life\r\nwere conducted by means of barter. For the first time in threequarters\r\nof a century the farmer was topdog; his eggs and milk, his wheat and\r\ncorn and potatoes he could exchange for whatever he fancied and on his\r\nown terms. Fortunately for starving citydwellers his appetite for\r\nmanufactured articles and for luxuries was insatiable; their\r\nautomobiles, furcoats, costumejewelry, washingmachines, files of the\r\n_National Geographic_, and their periodfurniture left the city flat for\r\nthe farm, to come back in the more acceptable form of steaks, butter,\r\nfowl, and turnips. The whole elaborate structure of money and credit\r\nseemed to disappear overnight like some tenuous dream.\r\n\r\nThe frenzied actions of the humanbeings had no effect on the grass. The\r\nsaltband still stood inviolate, as did smaller counterparts hastily laid\r\naround the earlier of the seedborne growths, but everywhere else the\r\ngrass swept ahead like a tidalwave, its speed seemingly increased by the\r\nmonths of repression behind. It swallowed San Diego in a gulp and\r\nleaped beyond the United States to take in Baja California in one swift\r\ndownward lick. It sprang upon the deserts, whose lack of water was no\r\ndeterrent, now always sending little groups ahead like paratroopers or\r\nfifthcolumnists; they established positions till the main body came up\r\nand consolidated them. It curled up the high mountains, leaving only the\r\nsnow on their peaks unmolested and it jumped over struggling rivers with\r\nthe dexterity of a girl playing hopscotch.\r\n\r\nIt lunged eastward into Arizona and Nevada, it swarmed north up the San\r\nJoaquin Valley through Fresno and spilled over the lip of the High\r\nSierras toward Lake Tahoe. New Los Angeles, its back protected by the\r\nSalton Sea, was, like the original one, subjected to a pincer movement\r\nwhich strangled the promising life from it before it was two years old.\r\n\r\nForced to move again, Le ffaçasé characteristically demanded the burden\r\nfall upon the employees of the paper, paying them off in scrip on the\r\npoor excuse that no money was available. I saw no future in staying with\r\nthis sinking ship and eager to be back at the center of things--Fles\r\nwrote me that the large stock of pemmican which had been accumulating\r\nwithout buyers could now be very profitably disposed of--I severed my\r\nconnection for the second time with the _Intelligencer_ and returned to\r\nmy proper sphere.\r\n\r\nThis of course did not mean that I failed to follow each step of the\r\ngrass; such a course would have been quite impossible since its every\r\nmove affected the life and fortune of every citizen. By some strange\r\nfreak it spared the entire coast north of Santa Barbara. Whether it had\r\nsome disinclination to approach saltwater--it had been notably slow in\r\nits original advance westward--or whether it was sheer accident, San\r\nLuis Obispo, Monterey and San Francisco remained untouched as the cities\r\nto the south and east were buried under grassy avalanches. This odd\r\nmercy raised queer hopes in some: perhaps their town or their state\r\nwould be saved.\r\n\r\nThe prostration of the country which had begun with the first wave of\r\npanic could not be allowed to continue. The government moved in and\r\nseized, first the banks and then the railroads. Abandoned realestate was\r\ndeclared forfeit and opened to homesteading. Prices were pegged and\r\nfarmers forced to pay taxes in produce.\r\n\r\nAlthough these measures restored a similitude of life to the nation, it\r\nremained but a feeble imitation of its previous self. Many of the idle\r\nfactories failed to reopen, others moved with painful caution. Goods,\r\nalready scarce, disappeared almost completely and at the same time a\r\nreckless disregard of formerly sacred symbols seized upon the people.\r\nThe grass was coming, so what good was the lot on which they were paying\r\ninstallments? The grass was coming, so why gather together the dollars\r\nto meet the interest on the mortgage? The grass was coming--what was the\r\nuse of depositing money in the bank which would probably go bust\r\ntomorrow?\r\n\r\nThe inflation would have been worse had it not been for the pegged\r\nprices and other stern measures. The glut on the labor market was\r\ntremendous and wages reached the vanishing point in a currency which\r\nwould buy little. Suddenly, the United States, which had so long boasted\r\nof being the richest country in the world, found itself desperately\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nGovernment work projects did little to relieve the suffering of the\r\nproletariat. Deaths from malnutrition mounted and the feeble strikes in\r\nthe few operating industries were easily and quickly crushed by starving\r\nstrikebreakers ashamed of their deed yet desperately eager to feed their\r\nhungry families. Riots broke out in New York and Detroit, but the police\r\nwere fortunately wellfed and the arms wielding the blackjacks which\r\ncrushed the skulls of the undernourished rioters were stout.\r\n\r\nThere was a sweeping revival of organized religion and men too broke to\r\nafford the neighborhood movie flocked to the churches. Brother Paul, now\r\non a national hookup, repeated his exhortations to all Christians,\r\nurging them to join their Savior in the midst of the grass. There was\r\ngreat agitation for restraining him; more reserved pastors pointed out\r\nthat he was responsible for increasing the national suicide rate, but\r\nthe Federal Communications Commission took no action against him,\r\npossibly because, as some said, it was cheaper to let a percentage of\r\nthe surplus population find an ecstatic death than to feed it.\r\n\r\nOn political maps the United States had lost not one foot of territory.\r\nPopulation statistics showed it harbored as many men, women, and\r\nchildren as before. Not one tenth of the national wealth had been\r\ndestroyed by the grass or a sixth of the country given up to it, yet it\r\nhad done what seven wars and many vicissitudes had failed to do: it\r\nbrought the country to the nadir of its existence, to a hopeless\r\ndespondency unknown at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\nAt this desperate point the federal government decided it could no\r\nlonger temporize with the clamor for using atomic power against the\r\ngrass. All the arguments so weighty at first became insignificant\r\nagainst the insolent facts. It was announced in a Washington\r\npressconference that as soon as arrangements could be made the most\r\nfearful of all weapons would be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_38._ No one doubted the atomicbomb would do the trick, finally and\r\nconclusively. The searing, volcanic heat, irresistible penetration,\r\nefficient destructiveness and the aftermath of apocalyptic radiation\r\npromised the end of the grass.\r\n\r\nWhen I say no one, of course I mean no clearthinking person of vision\r\nwith his feet on the ground who didnt go deliberately out of his way to\r\nlook for the dark side of things. Naturally there were crackpots, as\r\nthere always are, who opposed the use of the bomb for various untenable\r\nreasons, and among them I was not surprised to find Miss Francis.\r\n\r\nThough her pessimistic and unpopular opinions had been discredited time\r\nand again, the newspapers, possibly to enliven their now perpetually\r\ngloomy columns with a little humor, gave some space to interviews which,\r\nwith variations predicated on editorial policy, ran something like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n    Will you tell our readers what you think of using the atom bomb\r\n    against the grass?\r\n\r\n    I think it at the very best a waste of time; at the worst, extremely\r\n    dangerous.\r\n\r\n    In what way, Miss Francis?\r\n\r\n    In every way. Did you ever hear of a chain-reaction, young man? Or\r\n    radioactivity? Can you conceive, among other possibilities--and\r\n    mind, this is merely a possibility, a quite unscientific guess\r\n    merely advanced in the vain hope of avoiding one more folly--of the\r\n    whole mass becoming radioactive, squaring or cubing its speed of\r\n    growth, or perhaps throwing before it a lethal band miles wide? Mind\r\n    you, I'm not anticipating any of this, not even saying it is a\r\n    probability; but these or similar hazards may well attend this\r\n    illconsidered venture.\r\n\r\n    You speak strongly, Miss Francis. None of the rather fantastic\r\n    things you predict followed Hiroshima, Nagasaki or Bikini.\r\n\r\n    In the first place, I tried, with apparent unsuccess, to make it\r\n    clear I'm not predicting. I am merely mentioning possibilities. In\r\n    the second place, we don't know exactly what were the aftereffects\r\n    of the previous bombs because of a general inability to correlate\r\n    cause and effect. I only know that in every case the use of the\r\n    atomic bomb has been followed at greater or lesser intervals by\r\n    tidal waves, earthquakes and other 'natural' phenomena. Now do not\r\n    quote me as saying the Hilo tidal wave was the result of the\r\n    Nagasaki bomb or the Chicagku earthquake, the Bikini; for I didnt. I\r\n    only point out that they followed at roughly equal intervals.\r\n\r\n    Then you are opposed to the bomb?\r\n\r\n    Common sense is. Not that that will be a deterrent.\r\n\r\n    What would you substitute for it?\r\n\r\n    If I had a counteragent to the grass ready I would not be wasting\r\n    time talking to reporters. I am working on one. When it is found, by\r\n    me or another, it will be a true counteragent, changing the very\r\n    structure and habit of _Cynodon dactylon_ as the Metamorphizer\r\n    changed it originally. External weapons, by definition, can at\r\n    best, at the very best, merely stop the grass--not render it\r\n    innocuous. Equals fighting equals produce only deadlocks.\r\n\r\nAnd so on. The few reputable scientists who condescended to answer her\r\nat all and didnt treat her views with dignified silence quickly\r\ndemonstrated the absurdity of her objections. Chainreactions and\r\nradioactive advanceguard! Sundaysupplement stuff, without the slightest\r\nbasis of reasoning; not a mathematical symbol or laboratory experiment\r\nto back up these fictional nightmares. And not use external weapons,\r\nindeed! Was the grass to be hypnotized then? Or made to change its\r\nbehaviorpatterns through judicious sessions with psychoanalysts\r\nstationed along its periphery?\r\n\r\nWhether because of Miss Francis' prophesies or not, it would be futile\r\nto deny that a certain amount of trepidation accompanied the decision to\r\nuse the bomb. Residents of Arizona wanted it dropped in California; San\r\nFranciscans urged the poetic justice and great utility of applying it to\r\nthe very spot where the growth originated; all were in favor of the\r\ndevastation at the farthest possible distance from themselves.\r\n\r\nPartly in response to this pressure and partly in consideration of other\r\nfactors, including the possibility of international repercussions, the\r\nCommission to Combat Dangerous Vegetation decided on one of the least\r\nawesome bombs in the catalogue. Just a little bomb--hardly more than a\r\ntoy, a plaything, the very smallest practicable--ought to allay all\r\nfears and set everyone's mind at rest. If it were effective, a bigger\r\none could be employed, or numbers of smaller ones.\r\n\r\nThis much being settled, there was still the question of where to\r\ninitiate the attack. Edge or heart? Once more there was controversy, but\r\nit lacked the enthusiasm remembered by veterans of the salt argument; a\r\ncertain lassitude in debate was evident as though too much excitement\r\nhad been dissipated on earlier hopes, leaving none for this one. There\r\nwas little grumbling or soreness when the decision was finally confirmed\r\nto let fall the bomb on what had been Long Beach.\r\n\r\nWhen I read of the elaborate preparations being made to cover the great\r\nevent, of the special writers, experts, broadcasters, cameramen, I was\r\nthankful indeed I was no longer a newspaperman, arbitrarily to be\r\nordered aloft or sent aboard some erratic craft offshore on the bare\r\nchance I might catch a comprehensive or distinctive enough glance of the\r\naction to repay an editor for my discomfort. Instead, I sat contentedly\r\nin my apartment and listened to the radio.\r\n\r\nWhether our expectations had been too high or whether all the\r\neyewitnesses became simultaneously inept, I must say the spot broadcast\r\nand later newspaper and magazine accounts were uniformly disappointing.\r\nIt was like the hundredth repetition of an oftentold story. The flash,\r\nthe chaos, the mushroomcloud, the reverberation were all in precise\r\norder; nothing new, nothing startling, and I imagine the rest of the\r\ncountry, as I did, turned away from the radio with a distinct feeling of\r\nhaving been let down.\r\n\r\nFirst observation through telescope and by airplanes keeping a\r\nnecessarily cautious distance, showed the bomb had destroyed a patch of\r\nvegetation about as large as had been expected. Though not spectacular,\r\nthe bombing had apparently been effective on a comparatively small\r\nsegment and it was anticipated that as soon as it was safe to come close\r\nand confirm this, the action would be repeated on a larger scale. While\r\nhundreds more of the baby bombs, as they were now affectionately called,\r\nwere ordered and preparations made systematically to blast the grass out\r\nof existence, the aerial observers kept swooping in closer and closer\r\nwith cameras trained to catch every aspect of the damage.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt an area of approximately four square miles had been\r\nutterly cleaned of the weed and a further zone nine times that size had\r\nbeen smashed and riven, the grass there torn and mangled--in all\r\nprobability deprived of life. Successive reconnoitering showed no\r\nchanges in the annihilated center, but on the tenth day after the\r\nexplosion a most startling observation of the peripheral region was\r\nmade. It had turned a brilliant orange.\r\n\r\nNot a brown or yellow, or any of the various shades of decay which\r\nBermuda in its original form took on at times, but a glowing and\r\nunearthly, jewellike blaze.\r\n\r\nThe strange color was strictly confined to the devastated edge of the\r\nbombcrater; airmen flying low could see its distinction from the rest of\r\nthe mass clear and sharp. In the center, nothing; around it, the weird\r\norange; and beyond, the usual and accustomed green.\r\n\r\nBut on second look, not quite usual, not quite accustomed. The\r\ninoculated grass had always been a shade or two more intense than\r\nordinary _Cynodon dactylon_; this, just beyond the orange, was still\r\nmore brilliant. Not only that, but it behaved unaccountably. It writhed\r\nand spumed upward in great clumps, culminating in enormous, overhanging\r\ncaps inevitably suggesting the mushroomcloud of the bomb.\r\n\r\nThe grass had always been cautious of the sea; now the dazzling growth\r\nplunged into the saltwater with frenzy, leaping and building upon\r\nitself. Great masses of vegetation, piers, causeways, isthmuses of grass\r\noffered the illusion of growing out of the ocean bottom, linking\r\nthemselves to the land, extending too late the lost coast far out into\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nBut this was far from the last aftereffect. Though attention had\r\nnaturally been diverted from the orange band to the eccentric behavior\r\nof the contiguous grass, it did not go unobserved and about a week after\r\nits first change of color it seemed to be losing its unnatural hue and\r\nturning green again.\r\n\r\nNot the green of the great mass, nor of the queer periphery, nor of\r\nuninspired devilgrass. It was a green unknown in living plant before; a\r\nglassy, translucent green, the green of a cathedral window in the\r\nmoonlight. By contrast, the widening circle about it seemed subdued and\r\norderly. The fantastic shapes, the tortured writhings, the unnatural\r\nextensions into the ocean were no longer manifest, instead, for miles\r\naround the ravaged spot where the bomb had been dropped, the grass burst\r\ninto bloom. Purple flowers appeared--not the usual muddy brown, faintly\r\nmauve--but a redviolet, brilliant and clear. The period of generation\r\nwas abnormally shortened; seed was borne almost instantly--but the seed\r\nwas a sport.\r\n\r\nIt did not droop and detach itself and sink into the ground. Instead,\r\ntufted and fluffy, like dandelion seed or thistledown, it floated upward\r\nin incredible quantities, so that for hundreds of miles the sky was\r\nobscured by this cloud bearing the germ of the inoculated grass.\r\n\r\nIt drifted easily and the winds blew it beyond the confines of the\r\ncreeping parent. It lit on spots far from the threatening advance and\r\nsprouted overnight into great clumps of devilgrass. All the anxiety and\r\npanic which had gone before was trivial in the face of this new threat.\r\nNow the advance was no longer calculable or predictable; at any moment a\r\nspot apparently beyond danger might be threatened and attacked.\r\n\r\nImmediately men remembered the exotic growth of flowers which came up to\r\nhide some of London's scars after the blitz and the lush plantlife\r\nobserved in Hiroshima. Why hadnt the allwise scientists remembered and\r\ntaken them into account before the bomb was dropped? Why had they been\r\nblind to this obvious danger? Fortunately the anger and terror were\r\nassuaged. Observers soon discovered the mutants were sterile, incapable\r\nof reproduction. More than that: though the new clumps spread and\r\nflourished and grew rapidly, they lacked the tenacity and stamina of the\r\nparent. Eventually they withered and dwindled and were in the end no\r\ndifferent from the uninoculated grass.\r\n\r\nNow a third change was seen in the color band. The green turned\r\ndistinctly blue and the sharp line between it and the rest of the weed\r\nvanished as the blueness shaded out imperceptibly over miles into the\r\ngreen. The barren spot made by the bomb was covered; the whole mass of\r\nvegetation, thousands of square miles of it, was animated by a surging\r\nnew vigor, so that eastward and southward the rampant tentacles jumped\r\nto capture and occupy great new swaths of territory.\r\n\r\nTriumphantly Brother Paul castigated the bombardiers and urged\r\nrepentance for the blasphemy to avert further welldeserved punishment.\r\nGrudgingly, one or two papers recalled Miss Francis' warning. Churches\r\nopened their doors on special days of humiliation and fasting. But for\r\nmost of the people there was a general feeling of relief; the ultimate\r\nin weapons had been used; the grass would wear itself out in good time;\r\nmeanwhile, they were thankful the effect of the atomicbomb had been no\r\nworse. If anything the spirit of the country, despite the great setback,\r\nwas better after the dropping of the bomb than before.\r\n\r\nI was so fascinated by the entire episode that I stayed by my radio\r\npractically all my waking hours, much to the distress of Button Fles.\r\nEvery report, every scrap of news interested me. So it was that I caught\r\nan item in a newscast, probably unheard by most, or smiled aside, if\r\nheard. _Red Egg_, organ of the Russian Poultry Farmers, editorialized,\r\n\"a certain imperialist nation, unscrupulously pilfering the technical\r\nadvance of Soviet Science, is using atomic power, contrary to\r\ninternational law. This is intolerable to a peace-loving people\r\nembracing 1/6 of the earth's surface and the poultrymen of the\r\nCollective, _Little Red Father_, have unanimously protested against such\r\ncapitalist aggression which can only be directed against the Soviet\r\nUnion.\"\r\n\r\nThe following day, _Red Star_ agreed; on the next, _Pravda_ reviewed the\r\n\"threatening situation.\" Two days later _Izvestia_ devoted a column to\r\n\"Blackmail, Peter the Great, Suvarov and Imperialist Slyness.\"\r\nTwentyfour hours after, the Ministerial Council of the Union of Soviet\r\nRepublics declared a state of war existed--through no action of its\r\nown--between the United States and the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n_39._ At first the people were incredulous. They could not believe the\r\nradio reports were anything but a ghastly mistake, an accidental\r\ngarbling produced by atmospheric conditions. Historians had told them\r\nfrom their schooldays of traditional Russian-American friendship. The\r\nRussian Fleet came to the Atlantic coast in 1862 to escape revolutionary\r\ninfection, but the Americans innocently took it as a gesture of\r\nsolidarity in the Civil War. The Communist party had repeated with the\r\nmonotony of a popular hymntune at a revival that the Soviet Union asked\r\nonly to be let alone, that it had no belligerent designs, that it was,\r\nas Lincoln said of the modest farmer, desirous only of the land that\r\n\"jines mine.\" At no point were the two nations' territories contiguous.\r\n\r\nAgitators were promptly jailed for saying the Soviet Union wasnt--if it\r\never had been--a socialist country; its imperialism stemming directly\r\nfrom its rejection of the socialist idea. As a great imperialist power\r\nbursting with natural resources it must inevitably conflict with the\r\nother great imperialist power. In our might we had done what we could to\r\nthwart Russian ambition; now they seized the opportunity to disable a\r\nrival.\r\n\r\nCongressmen and senators shredded the air of their respective chambers\r\nwith screams of outrage. In every speech, \"Stab in the back\" found an\r\nhonorable if monotonous place. Zhadanov, boss of the Soviet Union since\r\nthe death of the sainted Stalin, answered gruffly, \"War is no minuet. We\r\ndo not wait for the capitalist pigs to bow politely before we rise to\r\ndefend the heritage of Czar Ivan and our own dear, glorious, inspiring,\r\nvenerated Stalin. Stab in the back! We will stab the fascist lackeys of\r\nMorgan, Rockefeller and Jack and Heinze in whatever portion of the\r\nanatomy they present to us.\"\r\n\r\nAs usual, the recurring prophets who hold their seances between\r\nhostilities and invariably predict a quick, decisive war--in 1861 they\r\ngave it six weeks; in 1914 they gave it six weeks; in 1941 they gave it\r\nsix weeks--were proved wrong. They had been overweeningly sure this\r\ntime: rockets, guided missiles or great fleets of planes would sweep\r\nacross the skies and devastate the belligerents within three hours of\r\nthe declaration of war--which of course would be dispensed with. Not a\r\nbuilding would remain intact in the great cities nor hardly a civilian\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nBut three hours after Elmer Davis--heading an immediately revived Office\r\nof War Information--announced the news in his famous monotone, New York\r\nand Chicago and Seattle were still standing and so, three days later,\r\nwere Moscow and Leningrad and Vladivostok.\r\n\r\nAstonishment and unbelief were nationwide. The Empire State, the\r\nPalmolive Building, the Mark Hopkins--all still intact? Only when\r\ncommentators, rummaging nervously among old manuscripts, recalled the\r\nsolemn gentlemen's agreement never to use heavierthanaircraft of any\r\ndescription should the unthinkable war come, did the public give a\r\nheartfelt sigh of relief. Of course! Both the Soviet Union and the\r\nUnited States were nations of unstained honor and, rather than recall\r\ntheir pledged word, would have suffered the loss of a dozen wars.\r\nEveryone breathed easier, necks relaxed from the strain of scanning the\r\nskies; there would be neither bombs, rockets, nor guided missiles in\r\nthis war.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the conviction was established that the country was safe from\r\nthe memory of Hiroshima, panic gave place to relief and for the first\r\ntime some of the old spirit was manifest. There was no rush to\r\nrecruitingstations, but selectiveservice, operating smoothly except in\r\nthe extreme West, took care of mobilization and the war was accepted, if\r\nnot with enthusiasm, at least as an inescapable fate.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the grass had not depleted nor unbalanced the country's\r\nresources beyond readjustment, but it had upset the sensitive workings\r\nof the national economy. This was tolerable by a sick land--and the\r\ngrass had made the nation sick--in peacetime; but \"war is the health of\r\nthe state\" and the President moved quickly.\r\n\r\nAll large industries were immediately seized, as were the mines and\r\nmeans of transportation. A basic fiftyfivehour workweek was imposed. A\r\nnew chief of staff and of naval operations was appointed and the young\r\nmen went off to camp to train either for implementing or repelling\r\ninvasion. Then came a period of quiet during which both countries\r\nattacked each other ferociously over the radio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_40._ In the socialistic orgy of nationalizing business, I was\r\nfortunate; Consolidated Pemmican and Allied Concentrates was left in the\r\nhands of private initiative. Better than that, it had not been tied\r\ndown and made helpless by the multiplicity of regulations hampering the\r\nfew types of endeavor remaining nominally free of regimenting\r\nbureaucracy. Opportunity, long prepared for and not, I trust,\r\nundeserved, was before me.\r\n\r\nIn the pass to which our country had come it seemed to me I could be of\r\nmost service supplying our armed forces with fieldrations. Such an\r\nunselfish and patriotic desire one would think easy of realization--as I\r\nso innocently did--and I immediately began interviewing numberless\r\nofficers of the Quartermaster's Department to further this worthy aim.\r\n\r\nI certainly believe every corporation must have its rules, otherwise\r\nexecutives would be besieged all day by timewasters. The United States\r\ngovernment is surely a corporation, as I always used to say in\r\nadvocating election of a business administration, and standard\r\nprocedures and regulations are essential. Still, there ought to be a\r\nlimit to the number and length of questionnaires to fill out and the\r\nnumber of underlings to interview before a serious businessman can get\r\nto see a responsible official.\r\n\r\nAfter making three fruitless trips to Washington and getting\r\nexhaustively familiar with countless tantalizing waitingrooms, I became\r\nimpatient. The man I needed to see was a Brigadier General Thario, but\r\nafter wasting valuable days and hours I was no nearer reaching him than\r\nin the beginning. I had filled out the necessary forms and stated the\r\nnature of my business so often I began to be alarmed lest my hand refuse\r\nto write anything else and I be condemned for the rest of my life to\r\nrepeat the idiotic phrases called for in the blank spaces.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I must have raised my voice in expressing my exasperation to\r\nthe young lady who acted as receptionist and barrier. At any rate she\r\nlooked startled, and I think pressed a button on her desk. A pinkfaced,\r\nwhitemustached gentleman came hastily through the door behind her. The\r\njacket of his uniform fitted snugly at the waist and his bald head was\r\nsunburnt and shiny.\r\n\r\n\"What's this? What's this? ... going on here?\"\r\n\r\nI saw the single star on his shoulderstraps and ventured, \"General\r\nThario?\"\r\n\r\nHe hid his white mustache with a forefinger pink as his cheeks. \"Yes.\r\nYes. But you must have an appointment to speak to me. That's the rule,\r\nyou know. Must have an appointment.\" He appeared extremely nervous and\r\nharassed, his eyes darting back to the refuge of his office, but he was\r\nevidently held to the spot by whatever distress animated his\r\nreceptionist.\r\n\r\n\"General Thario,\" I persisted firmly, \"I quite appreciate your\r\nviewpoint, but I have been trying for days to get such an appointment\r\nwith you on a matter of vital concern and I have been put off every time\r\nby what I can only describe as redtape. I am sorry to say so, General\r\nThario, but I must repeat, redtape.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked more worried than before and his eyes ranged over the room for\r\nsome escape. \"Know just how you feel,\" he muttered, \"Know just how you\r\nfeel. Horrible stuff. Swaddled in it here. Simply swaddled in it.\r\nStrangled.\" He cleared his throat as though to disembarrass it of a\r\ngarrote. \"But, uh, hang it, Mr--\"\r\n\r\n\"Weener. Albert Weener. President of Consolidated Pemmican and Allied\r\nConcentrates Incorporated.\"\r\n\r\n\"--Well, you know, Mr. Weener ... man your position ... appreciate\r\nabsolute necessity certain amount of routine ... keep the cranks out,\r\notherwise swarming with them, simply swarming ... wartime precautions\r\n... must excuse me now ... terribly rushed ... glad to have met--\"\r\n\r\nSwallowing the rest of the sentence and putting his hand over his mouth\r\nlest he should inadvertently regurgitate it, he started for his office.\r\n\"General Thario,\" I pleaded, \"a moment. Consider our positions reversed.\r\nI have long since established my identity, my responsibility. I want\r\nnothing for myself; I am here doing a patriotic duty. Surely enough of\r\nthe routine you mention has been complied with to permit me to speak to\r\nyou for five or ten minutes. Do for one moment as I say, General, and\r\nput yourself in my place. Think of the discouragement you as a citizen\r\nwould feel to be hampered, perhaps more than is necessary.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his hand down from his mouth and looked at me out of blue eyes\r\nso pale as to be almost colorless. \"But hang it, you know, Mr Weener ...\r\nhighly irregular. Sympathize completely, but consider ... don't like\r\nbeing put in such a position ... why don't you come back in the\r\nmorning?\"\r\n\r\n\"General,\" I urged, flushed with victory, \"give me ten minutes now.\"\r\n\r\nHe collapsed. \"Know just how you feel ... wanted to be out in the field\r\nmyself ... no desk soldier ... lot of nonsense if you ask me. Come in,\r\ncome in.\"\r\n\r\nIn his office I explained the sort of contract I was anxious to secure\r\nand assured him of my ability to fulfill its terms. But I could see his\r\nmind was not intent upon the specifications for fieldrations. Looking up\r\noccasionally from a dejected study of his knees, he kept inquiring, in\r\nelliptical, practically verbless questions, how many men my plant\r\nemployed, whether I had a satisfactory manager and if a knowledge of\r\nchemistry was essential to the manufacture of concentrates; evading or\r\ndiscussing in the vaguest terms the actual business in hand.\r\n\r\nHowever, he seemed very friendly and affable toward me personally once\r\nthe chill air of the waitingroom had been left behind and as Button Fles\r\nhad advised me insistently to entertain without regard to expense any\r\nofficials with whom I came in contact, I thought it politic to invite\r\nhim to dinner. He demurred at first, but at length accepted, instructing\r\nhis secretary to phone his wife not to expect him home early. I\r\nsuggested Mrs Thario join us, but he shook his head, muttering, \"No\r\nplace for women, Mr Weener, no place for women.\" Whether this referred\r\nto Washington or the restaurant where we were going or to his life\r\nlargely was not clear.\r\n\r\nWartime Washington was in its usual chaotic turmoil and it was\r\nimpossible to get a taxi, so we had to walk. But the general did not\r\nseem at all averse to the exercise. It seemed to me he rather enjoyed\r\nreturning the salutes with the greatest punctilio and flourish. On our\r\nway we came to one of the capital's most famous taverns and I thought I\r\ndetected a hesitancy in his stride.\r\n\r\nNow I am not a drinking man myself. I limit my imbibing to an occasional\r\nglass of beer on account of the yeast it contains, which I consider\r\nbeneficial. I hope, however, I am no prig or puritan and so I asked\r\ncasually if he would care to stop in for an appetizer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now you mention it, Mr Weener ... hum ... fact is ... don't mind\r\nif I do.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I confined myself to my medicinal beverage the general conducted a\r\nmost remarkable raid on the bar. As I have hinted, he was in demeanor a\r\nmild appearing, if not indeed a timid man. In the course of an hour's\r\nconversation no word of profanity, such as is affected by many military\r\nmen, had crossed his lips. The framed photograph of his wife and\r\ndaughters on his desk and his respectful references to women indicated\r\nhe was not the type of soldier who lusts for rapine. But seated before\r\nthat dull mahogany bar, whatever inhibitions, whatever conventional\r\nshackles, whatever selfdenials and repressions had been inculcated fell\r\nfrom him swiftly and completely. He barked his orders at the bartender,\r\nwho seemed to know him very well, as though he were addressing a parade\r\nformation of badly disciplined troops.\r\n\r\nNot only did General Thario drink enormously, but he broke all the rules\r\nI had ever heard laid down about drinking. He began with a small, squat\r\nglass, which I believe is called an Oldfashioned glass, containing half\r\ncognac and half ryewhisky. He followed this with a tall tumbler--\"twelve\r\nfull ounces ... none of your eightounce thimbles ... not trifled\r\nwith\"--of champagne into which the bartender, upon his instructions and\r\nunder his critical eye, poured two jiggers of tropical rum. Then he\r\nwiped his lips with a handkerchief pulled from his sleeve and began with\r\na serious air on a combination of benedictine and tequila. The more he\r\nimbibed, the longer, more complete and more coherent his sentences\r\nbecame. He dropped his harassed air; his abdomen receded, his chest\r\nexpanded, bringing to my notice for the first time the rows of ribbons\r\nwhich confirmed his earlier assertion that he was not a desk soldier.\r\n\r\nHe was sipping curaçao liberally laced with applejack when he suggested\r\nwe have our dinner sent in rather than leave this comfortable spot. \"The\r\nfact of the matter is, Mr Weener--I'm going to call you Albert if you\r\ndon't mind--\"\r\n\r\nI said I didnt mind with all the heartiness at my command.\r\n\r\n\"The fact of the matter is, Albert, I have devoted my unfortunate life\r\nto two arts: the military and the potatory. As you may have noticed,\r\nmost of the miserable creatures on the wrong side of a bar adopt one of\r\ntwo reprehensible courses: either they treat drinking as though the aim\r\nof blending liquids were to imitate some French chef's fiddlefaddle--a\r\ndash of bitters, a squirt of orange, an olive, cherry, or onion wrenched\r\nfrom its proper place in the saladbowl, a twist of lemonpeel, sprig of\r\nmint or lump of sugar and an eyedropperful of whisky; or else they\r\nembrace the opposite extreme of vulgarity and gulp whatever rotgut is\r\nthrust at them to addle their undiscerning brains and atrophy their\r\nundiscriminating palates. Either practice is foreign to my nature and\r\nphilosophy. I believe the happiest combinations of liquors are simple\r\nones, containing no more than two ingredients, each of which should be\r\nnoble--that is to say, drinkable in its own right.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his fresh glass, containing brandy and arrack. \"No doubt you\r\nhave observed a catholicity in my taste; I range through the whole gamut\r\nfrom usquebaugh to sake, though during the present conflict for obvious\r\npatriotic reasons, I cross vodka from my list, while as a man born south\r\nof the Mason-Dixon Line, sir, I leave gin to Nigras.\"\r\n\r\nI must say, though somewhat startled by his manner of imbibing, I was\r\ninclined to like General Thario, but I was impatient to discuss the\r\nmatter of a contract for Consolidated Pemmican. Every time I attempted\r\nto bring the subject round to it he waved me grandly aside. \"Dinner,\" he\r\nconfirmed, when the waiters brought in their trays. \"Yes; no drink is\r\ncomplete without a little bit of the right food to garnish it. Eating in\r\nmoderation I approve of; but mark my words, Albert, the man who takes a\r\nmeal on an empty stomach is digging his grave with his teeth.\"\r\n\r\nIf he would not talk business I could only hope his amiability would\r\ncarry over till I saw him again in his office tomorrow. I settled down\r\nas far as I could, simply to enjoy his company. \"You may have been\r\nsurprised at my referring to my life as unfortunate, Albert, but it is a\r\njudicious adjective. Vilely unfortunate. I come of a military family,\r\nyou know; you will find footnotes mentioning the Tharios in the history\r\nof every war this country has had.\"\r\n\r\nHe finished what was in his glass. \"My misfortunes, like Tristram\r\nShandy's, began before my birth--and in the same way, exactly the same\r\nway. My father was a scholar and a gentleman who dreamed his life away\r\nover the campaigns of the great captains instead of attempting to become\r\na great captain himself. I do not condemn him for this: the organization\r\nof the army is such as to encourage impracticality and inadvertence, but\r\nthe consequences were unfortunate for me. He named me after his favorite\r\nheroes, Stuart Hannibal Ireton Thario, and so aloof was he from the\r\nvulgarities of everyday life that it was not until my monogram was\r\nordered painted upon my first piece of luggage that the unfortunate\r\ncombination of my initials was noted. Hannibal and Ireton promptly\r\nsuppressed in the interests of decency, nevertheless at West Point my\r\nsurname was twisted by fellow classmates into Lothario, giving it a\r\nconnotation quite foreign to my nature. I lived down both vexations only\r\nto encounter a third. Though Ireton remained successfully concealed, the\r\nHannibal leaked out and when, during the World War, I had the misfortune\r\nto lead a company which was decimated\"--his hand strayed to the ribbons\r\non his chest--\"behind my back the enlistedmen called me Cannibal\r\nThario.\"\r\n\r\nHe began discussing another drink. \"Of one thing I'm resolved: my son\r\nshall not suffer as I have suffered. I did not send him to West Point so\r\nhe might win decorations on the field of valor and then be shunted off\r\nto sit behind an unsoldierly desk. I broke with tradition when I kept\r\nhim from a military career, quite on purpose, just as I was thinking of\r\nhis welfare and not some silly foible of my own when I called him by the\r\nsimplest name I could find.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your son's name?\" I was constrained to ask.\r\n\r\n\"George,\" he answered proudly, \"George Thario. There is no nickname for\r\nGeorge as far as I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's not in the army now?\" I queried, more in politeness than\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"No, and I don't intend he shall be.\" The general's pink face grew\r\npinker with his vehemence. \"Albert, there are plenty of dunderheads and\r\nduffers like me in the country who are good for nothing better than\r\ncannonfodder. Let them go and be killed. I'm willing enough--only an\r\nidiotic General Staff has booted me into the Quartermaster Corps for\r\nwhich I am no more fitted than to run an academy for lady marines--but\r\nI'm not willing for a fine sensitive boy, a talented musician like\r\nGeorge to suffer the harsh brutalities of a trainingcamp and\r\nbattlefield.\"\r\n\r\n\"The draft ...\" I began tentatively.\r\n\r\n\"If George had a civilian position in an essential industry--say one\r\nholding a contract with the army for badly needed fieldrations....\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to meet your son,\" I said. \"I have been looking around\r\nfor some time for a reliable manager....\"\r\n\r\n\"George might consider it.\" General Thario squinted his glass against\r\nthe light. \"I'll have him stop by your hotel tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe little radio behind the bar, which had been mumbling to itself for\r\nhours, spoke loudly. \"We interrupt this program to bring you a\r\nnewsflash: Eire has declared war on the Soviet Union. I repeat, war has\r\nbeen declared on the Union of Soviet Republics by Eire. Keep tuned to\r\nthis station for further details. We return you now to our regular\r\nprogram.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an absent pattering of applause and General Thario stood up\r\ngravely, glass in hand. \"Gallant little Eire--or, if I may be permitted\r\nonce the indulgence of using the good old name we know and love so\r\nwell--brave old Ireland. When the world was at war, despite every\r\nprovocation, she stayed peaceful. Now that the world is disgracefully\r\npacific--and you have all heard foreign ministers unanimously declaring\r\ntheir countries neutral--so fast did they rush to the microphones that\r\nthey were still panting when they went on the air--when the whole world\r\nwas cautious, Ireland, true to her traditions, joined the just cause.\r\nGentlemen, I give you our fighting ally, Eire.\"\r\n\r\nDeparting from his usual custom, he drank the toast in one gulp, but no\r\none else in the room paid any attention. I considered this lack of\r\nenthusiasm for a courageous gesture quite unworthy and meditated for a\r\nmoment on the insensitivity into which our people seemed to have sunk.\r\n\r\nAs the evening went on, the general grew more and more affable and, if\r\npossible, less and less reticent. He had, he assured me, been the\r\nconstant victim, either of men or of circumstances. At the military\r\nacademy he had trained for the cavalry only to find himself assigned to\r\nthe tank corps. He had reconciled himself, pursued his duties with zeal,\r\nand was shunted off to the infantry, where, swallowing chagrin, he had\r\nled his men bravely into a crossfire from machineguns. For this he got\r\ninnumerable decorations and a transfer to the Quartermaster's\r\nDepartment. His marriage to the daughter of an influential politician\r\nshould have assured peacetime promotion, but the nuptials coincided with\r\nan election depriving the family's party of power.\r\n\r\nNow another war had come and he was a mere brigadier pigeonholed in an\r\nunimportant office with juniors broadly hinting at his retirement while\r\nclassmates were leading divisions and even army corps to glorious\r\nvictory on the field of battle. At least, they would have been leading\r\nthem to glorious victory if there had been any action at all.\r\n\r\n\"Invade,\" insisted General Thario, becoming sufficiently stirred by his\r\nfervor to lapse into sober incoherence. \"Invade them before they invade\r\nus. Aircraft out ... gentlemen's agreement ... quite understand ... well\r\n... landingbarges ... Bering Sea ... strike south ... shuttle\r\ntransports ... drive left wing TransSiberian ... holding operation by\r\nright and center ... abc ...\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was a pity he was deprived of the opportunity to try these\r\ntactics. I was one of the few who had not become a military theoretician\r\nupon the outbreak of the war, but to my lay mind his plan sounded\r\nfeasible. Nevertheless, I was more interested in the possible contract\r\nfor food concentrates than in any strategy, no matter how brilliant. I'm\r\nafraid I showed my boredom, for the general abruptly declared it was\r\ntime to go home.\r\n\r\n\r\n_41._ I was a little dubious that after all the drinking and confidences\r\nhe would remember to send his son around, and to tell the truth, in the\r\ncalm morning, I felt I would not be too sorry if he didnt, for he had\r\nnot given me a very high opinion of that young man. What on earth\r\nConsolidated Pemmican could do with a musician and a draftevader as\r\ngeneralmanager--even if the title, as it must be, were purely\r\nhonorary--I couldnt imagine.\r\n\r\nI had been long up, shaved and breakfasted and had attended to my\r\ncorrespondence, before the telephone rang and George Thario announced\r\nhimself at my disposal.\r\n\r\nHe was what people call a handsome young man. That is, he was big and\r\nburly and slow and his eyelashes were perceptible. His hair was short\r\nand he wore no hat, but lounged about the room with his hands, thumbs\r\nout, in his jacketpockets, looking at me vaguely through the curling\r\nsmoke from a bent pipe. I had never seen anyone look less like a\r\nmusician and I began to wonder if his father had been serious in so\r\ndescribing him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" he announced abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't like what, Mr Thario?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Joe to you,\" he corrected. \"Mister from you to me belies our\r\nprospective relationship. Just call me Joe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought your name was George.\"\r\n\r\n\"Baptismal--whim of the Old Man's. But it's a stuffy label--no\r\nshortening it, you know, so the fellows all call me Joe. Chummier. Don't\r\nlike the idea of evading the draft. Shows a lack of moral courage. By\r\nrights I ought to be a conchie, but that would just about kill the Old\r\nLady. She's in a firstclass uproar as it is--like to see me in the\r\nfrontlines right now, bursting with dulce et decorum. I don't believe it\r\nwould bother the Old Man any if I sat out the duration in a C O camp,\r\nbut it'd hurt his job like hell and the poor old boy is straining his\r\nguts to get into the trenches and twirl a theoretical saber. So I guess\r\nI'm slated to be your humble and obedient, Mr Weener.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be delighted to have you join our firm,\" I said wryly, for I felt\r\nhe would be a completely useless appendage. In this I am glad to say I\r\ndid him an injustice, for though he never denied his essential lack of\r\ninterest in concentrates and the whole process of moneymaking, he proved\r\nnevertheless--at such times as he chose to attend to his duties--a\r\nfaithful and conscientious employee, his only faults being lack of\r\ninitiative and a tendency to pamper the workers in the plant.\r\n\r\nBut I have anticipated; at the moment I looked upon him only as a\r\nliability to be balanced in good time by the asset of his father's\r\nposition. It was therefore with irritation I listened to his insistence\r\non my coming to the Thario home that afternoon to meet his mother and\r\nsisters. I had no desire for purely social intercourse, last evening's\r\nouting being in the nature of a business investment and it seemed\r\nsuperfluous to be forced to extend courtesies to an entire family\r\nbecause of involvement with one member.\r\n\r\nHowever great my reluctance I felt I couldnt afford to risk giving\r\noffense and so at fouroclock promptly I was in Georgetown, using the\r\nknocker of a door looking like all the other doors on both sides of the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Winifred Thario and youre the chewinggum man--no, wait a minute,\r\nI'll get it--the food concentrate man who's going to make Joe essential\r\nto the war effort. Do come in, and excuse my rudeness. I'm the youngest,\r\nyou know, except for Joe, so everybody excuses me.\" Her straight, blond\r\nhair looked dead. The vivacity which lit her windburned face seemed a\r\nfalse vivacity and when she showed her large white teeth I thought it\r\nwas with a calculated effort.\r\n\r\nShe led me into a livingroom peopled like an Earlyvictorian\r\nconversationpiece. Behind a low table, in a rockingchair, sat a large,\r\nfullbosomed woman with the same dead hair and weatherbeaten cheeks, the\r\nonly difference being that the blondness of her hair was mitigated by\r\ngray and in her face were the tiny broken red lines which no doubt in\r\ntime would come to Winifred.\r\n\r\n\"This is Mama,\" said Winifred, accenting the second syllable strongly\r\nand contriving at once to be vivacious and reverent.\r\n\r\nMama inclined her head toward me without the faintest smile, welcoming\r\nor otherwise, placing her hand as she did so regally upon the teacozy,\r\nas upon a royal orb.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Thario,\" I said, \"I am delighted to meet you.\"\r\n\r\nMama found this beneath her condescension.\r\n\r\n\"And this is Constance, the general's firstborn,\" introduced Winifred,\r\nstill retaining her liveliness despite Mama's low temperature. Constance\r\nwas the perfect connectinglink between Winifred and her mother, not yet\r\ngray but soon to be so, without Winifred's animation, but with the same\r\nvoluntary smile showing the same white teeth. She rose and shook my hand\r\nas she might have shaken a naughty puppy, with a vigorous sidewise jerk,\r\ndisengaging the clasp quickly.\r\n\r\n\"And this,\" announced Winifred brightly, \"is Pauline.\"\r\n\r\nTo say that Pauline Thario was beautiful would be like saying Mount\r\nEverest is high. In her, the blond hair sparkled like newly threshed\r\nstraw, the teeth were just as white and even, but they did not seem too\r\nlarge for her mouth, and her complexion was faultless as a cosmetic ad.\r\nShe was an unbelievably exquisite painting placed in an appropriate\r\nframe.\r\n\r\nAnd yet ... and yet the painting had a quality of unreality about it, as\r\nthough it were the delineation of a madonna without child, or of a nun.\r\nThere was no vigor to her beauty, no touch of the earthiness or of\r\nblemish necessary to make the loveliness real and bring it home. She did\r\nnot offer me her hand, but bowed in a manner only slightly less distant\r\nthan her mother's.\r\n\r\nI sat down on the edge of a petitpoint chair, thoroughly illatease. \"You\r\nmust tell us about your pills, Mr Weener,\" urged Winifred.\r\n\r\n\"Pills?\" I asked, at a loss.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the thingamyjigs youre going to have Joe make for you,\" explained\r\nConstance.\r\n\r\nMama made a loud trumpeting noise which so startled me I half rose from\r\nmy seat. \"Damned slacker!\" she exclaimed, looking fiercely right over my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mama--bloodpressure,\" enjoined Pauline in a colorless voice.\r\n\r\nMama relapsed into immobility and Winifred went on, quite as if there\r\nhad been no explosion. \"Are you married, Mr Weener?\"\r\n\r\nI said I was not.\r\n\r\n\"Then here's our chance for Pauline,\" decided Winifred. \"Mr Weener, how\r\nwould you like to marry Pauline?\"\r\n\r\nI could do nothing but smile uncomfortably. Was this the sort of\r\nconversation habitually carried on in their circle or were they quite\r\nmad? Constance mentioned with apparent irrelevance, \"Winifred is so\r\ngiddy,\" and Pauline smiled at me understandingly.\r\n\r\nBut Winifred went on, \"Weve been trying to marry Pauline off for years,\r\nyou know. She's wonderful to look at, but she hasnt any sexappeal.\"\r\n\r\nMama snorted, \"Damned vulgar thing to have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you like some tea, Mr Weener?\" asked Constance.\r\n\r\n\"Tea! He looks like a secret cocacola guzzler to me! Are you an American\r\nMr Uh?\" Mama demanded fiercely, deigning for the first time to address\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in California, Mrs Thario,\" I assured her.\r\n\r\n\"Pity. Pity. Damned shame,\" she muttered.\r\n\r\nI was partially relieved from my uneasiness by the appearance of George\r\nThario, who bounded in, waved lightly at his sisters and kissed his\r\nmother just below her hairline. \"My respectful duty, Mama,\" he greeted.\r\n\r\n\"Damned hypocrisy. You did your duty youd be in the army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bloodpressure,\" warned Constance.\r\n\r\n\"Have they made you thoroughly miserable, Mr Weener? Don't mind\r\nthem--there's something wrong with all the Tharios except the Old Man.\r\nBlood gone thin from too much intermarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like incest,\" exclaimed Winifred. \"Don't you think incest's\r\nfascinating, Mr Weener? Eugene O'Neill and all that sort of thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Morbid,\" objected Constance.\r\n\r\n\"Damned nonsense,\" grunted Mama.\r\n\r\n\"Cream or lemon, Mr Weener?\" inquired Constance. Mama, moved by a\r\nhospitable reflex, filled a grudging cup.\r\n\r\n\"Cream, please,\" I requested.\r\n\r\n\"Turn it sour,\" muttered Mama, but she poured the cream and handed the\r\ncup to Constance who passed it to Pauline who gave it to me with a\r\ngracious smile.\r\n\r\n\"You just mustnt forget to keep Pauline in mind, Mr Weener; she would be\r\na terrific help when you become horribly rich and have to do a lot of\r\nstuffy entertaining.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Winifred,\" protested Constance.\r\n\r\n\"Help him to the poorhouse and a damned good riddance.\"\r\n\r\nI spent another uneasy fifteen minutes before I could decently make my\r\ndeparture, wondering whether I hadnt made a mistake in becoming involved\r\nwith the Tharios at all. But there being no question of the solidity of\r\nthe general's position, I decided, since it was not afterall incumbent\r\nupon me to continue a social connection with them, to bear with it and\r\nconfine my acquaintance as far as possible to Joe and his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n_42._ As soon as the contracts were awarded the struggle began to obtain\r\nnecessary labor and raw materials. We were straining everything to do a\r\npatriotic service to the country in time of war, but we came up against\r\nthe competition for these essentials by ruthless capitalists who had no\r\nthought but to milk the government by selling them supplies at an\r\nenormous profit. Even with the wholehearted assistance of General Thario\r\nit was an endless and painful task to comply with, break through, or\r\nevade the restrictions and regulations thrown up by an uncertain and\r\nslowmoving administration, restrictions designed to aid our competitors\r\nand hamper us. Yet we got organized at last and by the time three\r\nRussian marshals had been purged and the American highcommand had been\r\nshaken up several times, we had doubled the capacity of our plant and\r\nwere negotiating the purchase of a new factory in Florida.\r\n\r\nI set aside a block of stock for the general, but its transfer was a\r\ndelicate matter on account of the indefatigable nosiness of the\r\ngovernment and I approached his son for advice. \"Alberich!\" exclaimed\r\nJoe incomprehensibly. \"Just wrap it up and mail it to him. Mama, God\r\nbless her, takes care of all financial transactions anyway.\" And\r\ndoubtless with great force, I thought.\r\n\r\nSuch directness, I pointed out, might have embarrassing repercussions\r\nbecause of inevitably smallminded interpretation if the facts ever\r\nbecame public. We finally solved the problem by putting the gift in\r\nGeorge Thario's name, he making a will leaving it to the general. I\r\ninformed his father in a guarded letter of what we had done and he\r\nreplied at great length and somewhat indiscreetly, as the following\r\nquotation may show:\r\n\r\n\"... In spite of pulling every handy and unhandy wire I am still\r\nbilleted on this ridiculous desk. The General Staff is the most\r\nincompetent set of blunderers ever to wear military uniform since Bull\r\nRun. They've never heard of Foch, much less of Falkenhayn and Mackensen,\r\nto say nothing of Rommel, Guderian or Montgomery. They rest idly behind\r\ntheir Washington breastworks when the order of the day should be attack,\r\nattack, and again attack; keeping the combat entirely verbal, weakening\r\nthe spirit of our forces and waiting supinely for the enemy to bring the\r\nwar to us....\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I was too much occupied with the press of business to follow\r\nthe daytoday progress of hostilities, there was little doubt the general\r\nwas justified in his strictures. The war was entirely static. With fear\r\nof raids by marauding aircraft allayed, the only remaining uneasiness of\r\nthe public had been whether the words \"heavier than air craft\" covered\r\nrobot or V bombs. But when weeks had passed without these dreadful\r\nmissiles whistling downward, this anxiety also went and the country\r\nsettled down to enjoy a wartime prosperity as pleasant, notwithstanding\r\nthe fiftyhour week, rationing, and the exorbitant incometax, as the\r\npeacetime panic had been miserable. In my own case Consolidated Pemmican\r\nwas quoted at 38 and I was on my way, in spite of all hampering\r\ncircumstances, to reap the benefits of foresight and industry. Unique\r\namong great combats, not a shot had so far been exchanged and everyone,\r\nexcept cranks, began to look upon the academic conflict as an unalloyed\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nGradually the war began leaving the frontpages, military analysts found\r\nthemselves next to either the chessproblems, Today's Selected Recipe, or\r\nthe weekly horoscope; people once more began to concern themselves with\r\nthe grass. It now extended in a vast sweep from a point on the Mexican\r\ncoast below the town of Mazatlan, northward along the slope of the Rocky\r\nMountains up into Canada's Yukon Province. It was wildest at its point\r\nof origin, covering Southern California and Nevada, Arizona and part of\r\nNew Mexico, and it was narrowest in the north where it dabbled with\r\ndelicate fingers at the mouth of the Mackenzie River. It had spared\r\npractically all of Alaska, nearly all of British Columbia, most of\r\nWashington, western Oregon and the seacoast of northern California.\r\n\r\nWhy it surged up to the Rockies and not over them when it had conquered\r\nindividually higher mountains was not understood, but people were quick\r\nonce more to take hope and remember the plant's normal distaste for cold\r\nor think there was perhaps something in the rarefied atmosphere to\r\nparalyze the seeds or inhibit the stolons, so preventing further\r\nprogress. Even through the comparatively low passes it came at such a\r\nslow pace methods tried fruitlessly in Los Angeles were successful in\r\nkeeping it back. Everyone was quite ready to wipe off the Far West if\r\nthe grass were going to spare the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thario's indiscreet letters kept coming. If anything, they\r\nincreased in frequency, indiscretion, and length as his continued\r\nfrustration in securing a field command was added to his helpless wrath\r\nat the generalstaff's ineptitude. \"... They have got hold of that odd\r\nfemale scientist, Francis,\" he wrote, \"and have made her turn over her\r\nformula for making grass go crazy. It's to be used as a war weapon, but\r\nhow or where I don't know. Just the sort of silly rot a lot of armchair\r\ntheorists would dream up....\"\r\n\r\nLater he wrote indignantly: \"... They are sending a group of picked men\r\nto Russia to inoculate the grasses on the steppes with this Francis\r\nstuff. Sheer waste of trained men; bungling incompetence. Why not send a\r\nspecially selected group of hypnotists to persuade the Russians to sue\r\nfor peace? It would be better to have given them Mills bombs and let\r\nthem blow up the Kremlin. Time and effort and good men thrown away ...\"\r\n\r\nStill later he wrote with unconcealed satisfaction: \"... Well, that\r\nsilly business of inoculating the steppes came to exactly nothing. Our\r\nfellows got through of course and did their job, but nothing happened to\r\nthe grass. Either Francis gave them the wrong formula (possibly mislaid\r\nthe right one in her handbag) or else what worked in California wouldn't\r\ndo elsewhere. She is busy trying to explain herself to a military\r\ncommission right now. For my part they can either shoot her or put her\r\nin charge of the WAC. It's of no moment. You can't fight a determined\r\nenemy with sprayguns and formulas. Attack with infantry by way of\r\nSiberia ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_43._ While everyone, except possibly General Thario and others in\r\nsimilar position, was enjoying the new comradeinarms atmosphere the\r\nabortive war had brought on, a sudden series of submarine attacks on the\r\nPacific Fleet provided a disagreeable jolt and ended the bloodless stage\r\nof the conflict. Tried and proved methods of detection and defense\r\nbecame useless; the warships were nothing more than targets for the\r\nenemy's torpedoes.\r\n\r\nIn quick succession the battleships _Montana_, _Louisiana_, _Ohio_, and\r\n_New Hampshire_ were sunk, as were the carriers _Gettysburg_,\r\n_Antietam_, _Guadalcanal_, and _Chapultepec_ as well as the cruisers\r\n_Manitowoc_, _Baton Rouge_, _Jackson_, _Yonkers_, _Long Beach_,\r\n_Evanston_ and _Portsmouth_, to say nothing of the countless destroyers\r\nand other craft. Never had the navy been so crippled and the people,\r\npresaging correctly a forthcoming invasion, suffered a new series of\r\nterrors which was only relieved by the news of the Russian landings on\r\nthe California coast at Cambria, San Simeon and Big Sur.\r\n\r\n\"... What did I tell you? What did I tell them, the duffers and\r\ndunderheads? We could have been halfway across Asia by now; instead we\r\nwaited and hemmed and hawed till the enemy, from the sheer weight of our\r\ninertia, was forced to attack. The whole crew should be courtmartialed\r\nand made to study the campaigns of Generals Shafter and Wheeler as\r\npunishment.\" General Thario's always precise handwriting wavered and\r\ntrembled with the violence of his disgust.\r\n\r\nAn impalpable war, pregnant with annihilating scientific devices and\r\nother unseen bogies was one thing; actual invasion of the sacred soil\r\nover which Old Glory flew, and by presumptuous foreigners who couldnt\r\neven speak English, was quite another. At once the will of the nation\r\nstiffened and for the first time something approaching enthusiasm was\r\nmanifest. Cartoonists, moved by a common impulse, unanimously drew\r\npictures of Uncle Sam rolling up his sleeves and preparing to give the\r\npesky interlopers a good trouncing before hurling them back into the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the presence of the grass prevented quick eviction of the\r\nunwelcome visitors. Only a small portion of the armed forces was based\r\non the Pacific coast, because of the logistical problems presented by\r\ninadequacies of supply and transportation. Of these only a fraction\r\ncould be sent to the threatened places for fear dispersions of the main\r\nbody would prove disastrous if the landings were feints. Thus the enemy\r\ncame ashore practically unopposed at his original landingpoints and\r\nsecured small additional beachheads at Gorda, Lucia, Morro Bay and\r\nCarmel.\r\n\r\nEast of the grass there were whole armies who had completed basic\r\ntraining, fit and supple. The obvious answer to the invasion was to load\r\nthem on transports and ship them to the theater of operations.\r\nUnfortunately the agreement not to use heavierthanaircraft was an\r\ninsuperable bar to this action.\r\n\r\nThat the pact had never been designed to prevent nations from defending\r\ntheir soil against an invader was certain; thousands of voices urged\r\nthat we keep the spirit of the treaty and disregard the letter. No one\r\ncould expect us to sit idly by and let our homeland be invaded because\r\nof overfinicky interpretation of a diplomatic document.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this clear logic, the American people were swept by a\r\nwave of timidity. \"If we use airplanes,\" they argued, \"so will the\r\nRussians; airplanes mean bombs; bombs mean atombombs. Better to let the\r\nRussians hold what advantage their invasion has given them than to have\r\nour cities destroyed, our population wiped out, our descendants--if\r\nany--born with six heads or a dozen arms as a result of radioactivity.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to General Thario, for a while it was touchandgo whether the\r\nPresident would yield to the men of vision or the others. But in the end\r\napprehension and calculation ordained that every effort must be made to\r\nreinforce the defense of the West Coast--except the effective one.\r\n\r\nOf course every dirigible was commandeered and work speeded up on those\r\nunder construction; troopships, heedless of their vulnerability, rushed\r\nfor the Panama Canal; while negotiations were opened with Mexico,\r\nlooking toward transporting divisions over its territory to a point\r\nsouth of the weed.\r\n\r\nWhile confusion and defeatism took as heavy a toll of the country's\r\nspirit as an actual defeat on the battlefield, the Russians slowly\r\npushed their way inland and consolidated their positions. The American\r\nunits offered valiant resistance, but little by little they were driven\r\nnorthward until a fairly fixed front was established south of San\r\nFrancisco from the ocean to the bay and a more fluid one from the bay to\r\nthe edge of the grass. Army men, like the public, were suspicious of the\r\nenemy's apparent contentment with this line, for they reasoned it\r\npresaged further landings to the north.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thario's jubilation contrasted with the common gloom. \"At last\r\nthe blunderers have given me active duty. I have a brigade in the Third\r\nArmy--finest of all. Can't write exactly where I'm stationed, but it is\r\nnot far from a wellknown city noted for its altitude, located in a\r\nmining state. Brigade is remarkably fit, considering, and the men are\r\nrearing to go. Keep your ear open for some news--it won't be long....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_44._ The news was of the heroic counterlandings. The entire fleet,\r\ndisdainful of possible submarine action, stood off from the rear of the\r\nRussian positions, bombarding them for fortyeight hours preliminary to\r\nlanding marines who fought their way inland to recapture nearly half the\r\ninvaded territory. Simultaneously the army below San Francisco pushed\r\nthe Russians back and made contact at some points with the marines. The\r\nenemy was reduced to a mere foothold.\r\n\r\nBut the whole operation proved no more than a rearguard action. As\r\nGeneral Thario wrote, \"We are fighting on the wrong continent.\" Joe was\r\neven broader and more emphatic. \"It's a putup job,\" he complained, \"to\r\nkeep costplus plants like this operating. If they called off their silly\r\nwar (Beethoven down in the cellar during the siege of Vienna expresses\r\nthe right attitude) and went home, the country would fall back into\r\ndepression, we'd have some kind of revolution and everybody'd be better\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nI had suspected him of being some kind of parlor radical and although he\r\nwould doubtless outgrow his youthful notions, it made me uneasy to have\r\na crank in my employ. But beyond urging him to keep his ideas strictly\r\nto himself and not leave any more memopads scribbled over with clef\r\nsigns on his desk, I could do nothing, for upon his retention depended\r\nhis father's goodwill--the general's assignment to a fieldcommand hadnt\r\naltered the status of our contracts--and we had too many unscrupulous\r\ncompetitors to rely solely upon merit for the continuance of our sales.\r\n\r\nGeorge Thario's attitude was symptomatic of the demoralization of the\r\ncountry, apparent even during our momentary success. There was no will\r\nto victory, and the generalstaff, if one could believe General Thario,\r\nwas too unimaginative and inflexible to meet the peculiar conditions of\r\na war circumscribed and shaped by the alien glacier dividing the country\r\nand diverting normal operations into novel channels.\r\n\r\nSo the new landings at Astoria and Longview, though anticipated and\r\nindeed precisely indicated by the flimsiness of the Russian resistance\r\nto the counteroffensive, caught the highcommand by surprise. \"Never was\r\na military operation more certain,\" wrote General Thario, \"and never was\r\nless done to meet the certainty. Albert, if a businessman conducted\r\nhimself like the military college he would be bankrupt in six months.\"\r\nWherever the fault lay, the American gains were wiped out and the\r\ninvaders swept ahead to occupy all of the country west of the grass.\r\n\r\nBoastfully, they sent us newsreels of their entries into Portland and\r\nSeattle. They established headquarters in San Francisco and paraded\r\nforty abreast down Market Street--renamed Krassny Prospekt. The Russians\r\nalso renamed Montgomery Street and Van Ness after Mooney and Billings\r\nrespectively, but for some reason abandoned these designations almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nBut for all their celebrations and 101 gun salutes, this was as far as\r\nthey could go; the monstrous growth which had clogged our defense now\r\nsealed the invaders off and held them in an evershrinking sector. Now\r\ncame another period of quiescence in the war, but a period radically\r\ndifferent in temper from the first. There were many, perhaps\r\nconstituting a majority, who like George Thario wanted a peace, almost\r\nany kind of peace, to be made. Others attempted to ignore the presence\r\nof a war entirely and to conduct their lives as though it did not exist.\r\nStill others seemed to regard it as some kind of game, a contest carried\r\non in a bloodless vacuum, and from these to the newspapers and the\r\nWardepartment came the hundreds of plans, nearly all of them entirely\r\nfantastic, for conquering an enemy now unassailably entrenched.\r\n\r\nBut while pessimism and lassitude governed the United States the\r\nintruders were taking energetic measures to increase their successes. \"I\r\nhave been present at the questioning of two spies,\" reported General\r\nThario, \"and I want to tell you the enemy is not going to miss a single\r\nopportunity, unlike ourselves. What they have in mind I cannot guess;\r\nthey can't fly over the grass any more than we can as long as they want\r\nto conciliate world opinion and I doubt if they can tunnel under it, but\r\nthat they intend to do _something_ is beyond question.\"\r\n\r\nOften the obvious course is the surprising one; since the Russians\r\ncouldnt go over or under the grass they decided to march on top of it.\r\nThey had heard of our prewar snowshoe excursions on its surface and so\r\nthey equipped a vast army with this clumsy footgear and set it in motion\r\nwith supplytrains on wide skis pulled by the men themselves. Russian\r\ningenuity, boasted the Kremlin, would succeed in conquering the grass\r\nwhere the decadent imperialists had failed.\r\n\r\n\"It is unbelievable--you might even call it absurd, but at least they\r\nare doing something, not sitting twiddling their thumbs. My men would\r\ngive six months' pay to be as active as the enemy. To be sure they are\r\ngrotesque and inefficient--so was the Army of Italy. Imagine sending an\r\narmy--or armies if our reports are correct--on a six hundred mile march\r\nwithout an airforce, without artillery, without any mechanized\r\nequipment whatsoever. Unless, like the Army of Italy, they have a\r\nBonaparte concealed behind their lunacy they have no chance at all of\r\nsuccess, but by the military genius of Joseph Eggleston Johnston, if I\r\nwere a younger man and not an American I would like to be with them just\r\nfor the fun they are having.\"\r\n\r\nBy its very nature the expedition was composed exclusively of infantry\r\ndivisions carrying the latest type of automatic rifle. The field\r\ncommissaries, the ambulances, the baggagetrains, had to be cut to the\r\nbarest minimum and General Thario wrote that evidently because of the\r\nimpossibility of taking along artillery the enemy had also abandoned\r\ntheir light and heavy machineguns. Against this determined threat,\r\nbehind the wall of the Rockies, the American army waited with field\r\nartillery, railway guns, bazookas and flamethrowers. For the first time\r\nthere was belief in a Russian defeat if not in eventual American\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nBut the waiting Americans were not to be given the opportunity for\r\nhandtohand combat. Since planes could not report the progress of the\r\nsnowshoers over the grass, dirigibles and free balloons drifting with\r\nthe wind gave minutetominute reports. Though many of the airships were\r\nshot down and many more of the balloons blown helplessly out of the\r\narea, enough returned to give a picture of the rapid disintegration of\r\nthe invading force.\r\n\r\nNothing like it had happened to an army since 1812. The snowshoes,\r\nadequate enough for short excursions over the edge of the grass, became\r\nsuicidal instruments on a march of weeks. Starting eastward from their\r\nbases in northern California, Oregon and Washington, in military\r\nformation, singing triumphantly in minor keys, the Slavic steamroller\r\nhad presented an imposing sight. Americans in the occupied area, seeing\r\ncolumn after column of closely packed soldiers tramping endlessly up and\r\nover the grass, said it reminded them of old prints of Pickett's charge\r\nat Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nThe first day's march went well enough, though it covered no more than a\r\nfew miles. At night they camped upon great squares of tarpaulin and in\r\nthe morning resumed their webfooted way. But the night had not proved\r\nrestful, for over the edges of every tarpaulin the eager grass had\r\nthrust impatient runners and when the time came to decamp more than half\r\nthe canvases had been left in possession of the weed. The second day's\r\nprogress was slower than the first and it was clear to the observers the\r\nmen were tiring unduly. More than one threw away his rifle to make the\r\nmarching easier, some freed themselves of their snowshoes and so after a\r\nfew yards sank, inextricably tangled into the grass; others lay down\r\nexhausted, to rise no more. The men in the balloons could see by the way\r\nthe feet were raised that the inquisitive stolons were more and more\r\nentangling themselves in the webbing.\r\n\r\nStill the Soviet command poured fresh troops onto the grass. Profiting\r\nperhaps by the American example, they transported new supplies to the\r\narmy by dirigibles, replacing the lost tarpaulins and rifles, daringly\r\nsending whole divisions of snowshoers by parachute almost to the eastern\r\nedge. This last experiment proved too reckless, for enough of these\r\nadventurers were located to permit their annihilation by longrange\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\n\"Their endurance is incredible, magnificent,\" eulogized General Thario\r\nenthusiastically. \"They are contending not only with the prospect of\r\nmeeting fresh, unworn troops on our side, but against a tireless enemy\r\nwho cannot be awed or hurt and even more against their own feelings of\r\nfear and despair which must come upon them constantly as they get\r\nfarther into this green desert, farther from natural surroundings,\r\ndeeper into the silence and mystery of the abnormal barrier they have\r\nundertaken to cross. They are supermen and only supernatural means will\r\ndefeat them.\"\r\n\r\nBut there was plenty of evidence that the general credited the foe with\r\na stronger spirit than they possessed. Their spirit was undoubtedly\r\nhigh, but it could not stand up against the relentless harassment of the\r\ngrass. The weary, sodden advance went on, slower and slower; the toll\r\nhigher and higher. There were signs of dissatisfaction, mutiny and\r\nmadness. Some units turned about to be shot down by those behind, some\r\nwandered off helplessly until lost forever. The dwindling of the great\r\narmy accelerated, airborne replacements dependent on such erratic\r\ntransport failed to fill the gaps.\r\n\r\nThe marchers no longer fired at the airships overhead; they moved their\r\nfeet slowly, hopelessly, stood stockstill for hours or faltered\r\naimlessly. Occasional improvised white flags could be seen, held\r\napathetically up toward the balloonists. Long after their brave start\r\nthe crazed and starving survivors began trickling into the American\r\nlines where they surrendered. They were dull and listless except for one\r\nstrange manifestation: they shied away fearfully from every living plant\r\nor growth, but did they see a bare patch of soil, a boulder or stretch\r\nof sand, they clutched, kissed, mumbled and wept over it in a very\r\nfrenzy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_45._ But the catastrophic loss of their great armies was not all the\r\nenemy had to endure. As the grass had stood our ally and swallowed the\r\nattackers, helping us in a negative fashion as it were, it now turned\r\nand became a positive force in our relief. Unnoticed for months, it had\r\ncrept northwestward, filching precious mile after mile of the hostile\r\nfoothold. Now it spurted ahead as it had sometimes done before, at a\r\nfurious pace, to take over the coast as far north as the Russian River,\r\nwhich now doubled the irony of its name, and added thousands of square\r\nmiles to its area at the enemy's expense. It surged directly westward\r\ntoo, making what was left of the invader's foothold precarious in the\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nThe stockmarket boomed and the country went wild with joy at the news of\r\nthe Soviet defeats. At the darkest moment we had been delivered by\r\nforces outside ourselves, but still indubitably American. Hymns of\r\npraise were sung to the grass as the savior of the nation and in a burst\r\nof gratitude it was declared a National Park, forever inviolate.\r\nRationing restrictions were eased and many industries were sensibly\r\nreturned to private ownership. Good old Uncle Sam was unbeatable\r\nafterall.\r\n\r\nBut if the Americans were jubilant, the Russians were cast into deepest\r\ngloom. Accustomed to tremendous wartime losses of manpower, they had at\r\nfirst taken the news stoically, interpreting it as just another defeat\r\nto be later redeemed by pouring fresh troops and then more fresh troops\r\nafter those which had gone down. But when they realized they had lost\r\nnot divisions but whole armies, that they had suffered a greater blow\r\nthan any in their history, that their reserve power was little greater\r\nthan the armies remaining to the Americans, and finally that the grass,\r\nthe foe which had dealt all these grievous blows, was rapidly wiping out\r\nwhat remained of their bridgehead, they began to murmur against the war\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Under our dear little Uncle Stalin,\" they said, \"this would never have\r\ntaken place. Our sons and brothers would not have been sent to die so\r\nfar away from Holy Mother Russia. Down with the enemies of Stalin. Down\r\nwith the warmongering bureaucracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kremlin hastened to assure the population it was carrying out the\r\nwishes of the sainted Stalin. It convinced them of the purity of its\r\nmotives by machinegunning all demonstrators and executing after public\r\ntrials all Trotskyite-fascist-American saboteurs and traitors. For some\r\nreason these arguments failed to win over the people and on November 7 a\r\nnew slogan was heard, \"Long live Stalin and Trotsky,\" which proved so\r\npopular that in a short time the entire bureaucracy was liquidated, the\r\nSoviet Union declared an unequivocal workers' state, the army replaced\r\nby Redguards, the selling of Soviet bonds decreed a contravention of\r\nsocialist economy, wages of all were equalized, and the word\r\nstakhanovism erased from all Russian dictionaries.\r\n\r\nNo formal peace was ever made. Neither side had any further appetite for\r\nwar and though newspapers like the _Daily Intelligencer_ continued for\r\nmonths to clamor for the resumption of hostilities, even to using\r\naircraft now that there was less danger of reprisal, both countries\r\nseemed content to return quietly to the status quo. The only results of\r\nthe war, aside from the tremendous losses, was that in America the grass\r\nhad been unmolested for a year, and the Soviet Union had a new\r\nconstitution. One of the peculiar provisions of this constitution was\r\nthat political offenders--and the definition was now severely limited,\r\nleaving out ninetynine percent of those formerly jeoparded--should\r\nhenceforth expiate their crimes by spending the term of their sentence\r\ngazing at the colossal and elaborate tomb of Stalin which occupied the\r\ncenter of Red Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n_46._ General Stuart Thario, rudely treated by an ungrateful republic,\r\nhad the choice of a permanent colonelcy or retirement. I have always\r\nthought it was his human vanity, making him cling to the title of\r\ngeneral, which caused him to retire. At any rate there was no difficulty\r\nin finding a place for him in our organization, and if his son's salary\r\nand position were reduced in consequence, it was all in the family, as\r\nthe saying goes.\r\n\r\nOne of the happy results of our unique system of free enterprise was the\r\nrewarding of men in exact proportion to their merits and abilities. The\r\nwar, bringing disruption and bankruptcy to so many shiftless and\r\nshortsighted people, made of Consolidated Pemmican one of the country's\r\ngreat concerns. The organization welcoming General Thario was far\r\ndifferent from the one which had hired his son. I now had fourteen\r\nfactories, stretching like a string of lustrous pearls from Quebec down\r\nto Montevideo, and I was negotiating to open new branches in Europe and\r\nthe Far East. I had been elected to the directorship of several\r\nimportant corporations and my material possessions were enough to\r\nconstitute a nuisance--for I have always remained a simple, literary\r\nsort of fellow at heart--requiring secretaries and stewards to look\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nIt is a depressing sidelight on human nature that the achievement of\r\neminence brings with it the malice and spite of petty minds and no one\r\nof prominence can avoid becoming the target of stupid and unscrupulous\r\nattack. It would be pointless now to go into those carping and unjust\r\naccusations directed at me by irresponsible newspaper columnists.\r\nAnother man might have ignored these mean assaults, but I am naturally\r\nsensitive, and while it was beneath my dignity to reply personally I\r\nthought it perhaps one of the best investments I could make to add a\r\nnewspaper to my other properties.\r\n\r\nNow I am certainly not the sort of capitalist portrayed by cartoonists\r\nin the early part of the century who would subvert the freedom of the\r\npress by handpicking an editor and telling him what to say. I think the\r\nproof of this as well as of my broadmindedness is to be found in the\r\nfact that the paper I chose to buy was the _Daily Intelligencer_ and the\r\neditor I retained was William Rufus Le ffaçasé. The _Intelligencer_ had\r\nlost both circulation and money since it had, so to speak, no home base.\r\nBut moved perhaps by sentiment, I was not deterred from buying it for\r\nthis reason, and anyway it was purchasable at a more reasonable figure\r\non this account.\r\n\r\nSmall circulation or no, it--or rather Le ffaçasé himself--still\r\npossessed that intangible thing called prestige and I was satisfied with\r\nmy bargain. Le ffaçasé showed no reluctance--as why indeed should\r\nhe?--to continue as managingeditor and acted toward me as though there\r\nhad never been any previous association, but I did not object to this\r\nharmless eccentricity as a smallerminded person might have.\r\n\r\nAs publisher I named General Thario. I never knew exactly what purpose a\r\npublisher serves, but it seemed necessary for every newspaper to have\r\none. Whatever the duties of the office, it left the general plenty of\r\ntime to attend to the concerns of Consolidated Pemmican. I fed the paper\r\njudiciously with money and it was not long before it regained most of\r\nthe circulation it had lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_47._ There was no doubt the grass, our ally to such good purpose in the\r\nwar, had definitely slowed down; now it was looked upon as a fixture, a\r\npart of the American heritage, a natural phenomenon which had outlived\r\nits sensational period and come to be taken for granted. Botanists\r\npointed out that _Cynodon dactylon_, despite its ability to sheathe\r\nitself against a chill, had never flourished in cold areas and there was\r\nno reason to suppose the inoculated grass, even with its abnormal\r\nmetabolism, could withstand climates foreign to its habit. It was true\r\nit had touched, in one place, the arctic tundra, but it was confidently\r\nexpected this excursion would soon cease. The high peaks of the Rockies\r\nwith the heavy winter snowdrifts lying between them promised no\r\npermanent hospitality, and what seeds blew through the passes and\r\nlighted on the Great Plains were generally isolated by saltbands, and\r\nsince they were confined to comparatively small clumps they were easily\r\nwiped out by salt or fire. To all appearance the grass was satiated and\r\ncontent to remain crouching over what it had won.\r\n\r\nOnly a minority argued that in its new form it might be infinitely\r\nadaptable. Before, when stopped, it had produced seeds capable of\r\nbearing the parent strain. So now, they argued, it would in time\r\nacclimate itself to more rigorous temperatures. Among these pessimists,\r\nMiss Francis, emerging from welldeserved obscurity, hysterically ranged\r\nherself. She prophesied new sudden and sweeping advances and demanded\r\nmoney and effort equal to that expended in the late war be turned to\r\ncombating the grass. As if taxes were not already outrageously high.\r\n\r\nThose in authority, with a little judicious advice from persons of\r\nstanding, quite properly disregarded her querulous importunities. The\r\nwhole matter of dealing with the weed was by now in the hands of a\r\npermanent body, the Federal Disruptions Commission. This group had spent\r\nthe first six months of its existence exactly defining and asserting its\r\njurisdiction, which seemed to spread just as the vegetation calling it\r\ninto being did; and the second six months wrangling with the Federal\r\nTrade Commission over certain \"Cease and Desist\" orders issued to firms\r\nusing allusions to the grass on the labels of their products, thereby\r\nimplying they were as vigorous, or of as wide application, as the\r\nrepresentation. The Disruptions Commission had no objection in principle\r\nto this castigation; they merely thought it should have come from their\r\nregulatory hands.\r\n\r\nBut with the end of the war a new spirit animated the honorable members\r\nof the commission and as a token of revived energy they issued a stern\r\ndirective that no two groups engaged in antigraminous research were to\r\npool their knowledge; for competition, the commission argued in the\r\nsixtyseven page order, spurred enthusiasm and the rivalry between\r\nworkers would the sooner produce a solution. Having settled this\r\nbasically important issue they turned their attention to investigating\r\nthe slower progress of the grass to determine whether it was permanent\r\nor temporary and whether its present sluggishness could be turned to\r\ngood account. As a sort of side project--perhaps to show the wideness of\r\ntheir scope--they undertook as well to study the reasons for the failure\r\nof the wartime inoculation of the steppes as contrasted with the\r\noriginal too successful California one. They planned a compilation of\r\ntheir findings, tentatively scheduled to cover a hundred and fortyseven\r\nfoliovolumes which would remain the basic work for all approaching the\r\nproblem of attacking the grass; and as an important public figure who\r\nhad some firsthand knowledge of the subject they requested me to visit,\r\nat my own expense, the newest outposts of the weed and favor them with\r\nmy observations. I was not averse to the suggestion, for the authority\r\nof the commission would admit me to areas closed to ordinary citizens\r\nand I was toying with the idea it might be possible in some way to use\r\nthe devilgrass as an ingredient in our food products.\r\n\r\n\r\n_48._ George Thario having shown in many ways he was growing stale on\r\nthe job and in need of a vacation, I decided to take him with me.\r\nBesides, if the thought of using the weed as a source of cheap\r\nrawmaterial came to anything, the engagement of his interest at an early\r\nstage would increase his usefulness. Before setting out for the field I\r\nread reports of investigators on the spot and was disquieted to note a\r\nunanimous mention of new stirrings on the edges of the green glacier. I\r\ndecided to lose no time and we set out at once in my personal plane for\r\na mountain lodge kindly offered by a business acquaintance. Here, for\r\nthe next few weeks, keeping in touch with my manifold affairs only by\r\ntelephone, Joe and I devoted ourselves to observing the grass.\r\n\r\nOr rather I did. George Thario's idea of gathering data differed\r\nradically from mine--I feel safe to say, as well as from that of almost\r\nany other intelligent man. In a way he reminded me of the cameraman\r\nSlafe in his brooding obliviousness to everything except the grass; but\r\nSlafe had been doing a job for which he was being paid, whereas Joe was\r\nonly yielding to his own mood. For hours he lay flat on his belly,\r\nstaring through binoculars; at other times he wandered about the edge,\r\nlooking at, feeling, and smelling it and once I saw him bend down and\r\nnibble at it like a sheep.\r\n\r\n\"You know, A W,\" he observed enthusiastically--he always called me \"A W\"\r\nwith just enough of a curious intonation to make it doubtful whether the\r\nuse of the initials was respectful or satirical--\"you know, A W, I\r\nunderstand those fellows who went and chucked themselves into the grass.\r\nIt's sublime; it has never happened in nature before. Ive read newspaper\r\nand magazine accounts and either the writers have no eyes or else they\r\nlie for the hell of it. They talk about the 'dirty brown' of the\r\nflowers, but A W, Ive seen the flowers myself and theyre a vivid\r\nglorious purple. Have you noticed the iridescent sparkle when the wind\r\nripples the blades? All the colors of the spectrum against the\r\nbackground of that marvelous green.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing marvelous about it,\" I told him a little irritably.\r\n\"It used to be really green, a bright, even color, but up here where\r\nit's high and cold it doesnt look much different from ordinary\r\ndevilgrass--dirty and ugly.\" I thought his enthusiasm distinctly out of\r\nplace in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to hear me, but went on dreamily, \"And the sounds it\r\nmakes! My God, A W, a composer'd give half the years of his life to\r\nreproduce those sounds. High and piercing; soft and muted; creating\r\ntonepoems and études there in its lonely grandeur.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken before of the noise produced by the weed, a thunderous\r\ncrackling and snapping attributable to its extraordinary rate of growth.\r\nDuring its dormancy the sound had ceased and, in the mountains at least,\r\nwas replaced by different notes and combinations of notes as the wind\r\nblew through its culms and scraped the tough stems against each other.\r\nOccasionally these ululations produced reflections extremely pleasing,\r\nmore often it hurt the ears with a shrieking discordance; but even at\r\nits best it fell far short, to my mind--and I suppose I may say I'm as\r\nsensitive to beauty as anybody--of meriting Joe's extravagant\r\nrhapsodies.\r\n\r\nBut he was entranced beyond the soberness of commonsense. He filled\r\nnotebooks, those thick pulppapered volumes which children are supposed\r\nto use in school but never do, with his reactions. In idle moments when\r\nhe was away, I glanced through them, but for the most part they were\r\nincoherent. Meterless poems, lists of adjectives, strained\r\ninterpretations of the actions of the grass, and many musical notations\r\nwhich seemed to get no farther than a repetitive and faltering start.\r\n\r\nI reproduce a few pages of the less chaotic material for what it is\r\nworth: \"The iceage drove the Cromagnon from the caves which prophesied\r\nCnossus and Pithom and the Temple of Athena in the Acropolis. This\r\ngrass, twentiethcentury ice, drives magnates from their twentyroom\r\nvillas to their twentyroom duplexes. The loss was yesterday's. Walt\r\nWhitman.\r\n\r\n\"For it is the animals. Cows and pigs, horses, goats, sheep and rabbits\r\nabandoned by the husbandman, startled, puzzled; the clock with the\r\nbroken mainspring running backward. The small game: deer, antlered,\r\nstriped, and spotted; wildsheep, _ovis poli_, TeddyRooseveltshot and\r\nAudubonprinted, mountaingoats leaping in terror to hazardous safety on\r\nbabel's top, upward to the pinpoint where no angels dance. But not\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\"Meat and meateater, food and feeder, predator and prey; foxes, lynx,\r\ncoyotes, wolves, wildcats, mountainlion (the passengerpigeon's gone, the\r\ndung they pecked from herds thick as man born and man yet to be born\r\nlies no more on the plains, _night and day we traveled, but the birds\r\noverhead gave cover from the sun and the buffalo before us stretched\r\nfrom the river to the hills_), driven by the ice not ice, but living\r\ngreen, up and up. Pause here upon this little shelf to nibble bark, to\r\nmate and bear; to snarl and claw and rend and suck hot blood from moving\r\njugularvein; and then move again upward with docile hoof or else retreat\r\nwith lashing tail and snarling fang. Biter and bitten transfused with\r\nfear, the timberline behind, the snow alone welcoming, ironically the\r\nglacier meets another glacier and only glacier gives refuge to glacier's\r\nhunted.\r\n\r\n\"Here little islands on the peaks. Vegetation's sea is death creeping\r\nupward to end at the beginning. The carnivores, whippedtailed, seek the\r\ntop, ambition's pinnacle, surveying nothing. Tomorrow is for man, the\r\nlower mind is reasonable and ponders food and dung and lust, so\r\nobstinate the padclaw prowls higher till nothing's left but pedestal and\r\nwould then wing, but being not yet man can only turn again.\r\n\r\n\"The ruminants, resigned, nibble at the edges of their death, converting\r\ndeath to life, chewing, swallowing, digesting, regurgitating and\r\ndigesting again inescapable fate. Reluctant sustenance. Emptybellied,\r\nthe pointed teeth descend again to take their food at secondhand, to go\r\nback sated, brown blood upon the snow and bits of hide and hair,\r\ngnawedat bones, while fellows, forgetting fear, remaining stoic, eat,\r\nstamp and stamp without impatience and eat again of that which has\r\ncondemned them.\r\n\r\n\"Learned doctor, your addingmachine gives you the answer: so many\r\ncarnivores, so many herbivores, the parallel dashes introduce\r\nextinction. Confusedly the savor of Abel's sacrifice was sweet to His\r\nnostrils, not Cain's fruits. So is the mind confounded. Turning and\r\ndevouring each other over prostrate antlers the snarlers die, their\r\nfurry hides bloat and then collapse on rigid bones to make a place for\r\ncurious sniffings and quick retreat in trampled snow. There is no\r\nvictory without harshness, no hope in triumph. The placid ruminants\r\nlive--the conquerors have conquered nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The grass comes to the edge of the snow; they eat and fill their meager\r\nbellies, they chew the cud and mate and calve and live in wretched\r\nunawareness of the heat of glory and death. So is justice done and mercy\r\nand yet not justice and yet not mercy. Who was victor yesterday is not\r\nvictor today, but neither is he victim. Who was victim yesterday is not\r\nvictor, but neither is he victim....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_49._ In all this confused rambling I thought there might be a curious\r\nand interesting little observation about animal migration--if one could\r\ntrust the accuracy of an imagination more romantic than factual--and I\r\nreduced it to some kind of coherence and added it not only to my report\r\nfor the Federal Disruptions Commission, but for the dispatches I found\r\ntime to send in to the _Intelligencer_. I hardly suppose it is necessary\r\nto mention that by now my literary talents could no longer be denied or\r\nignored and that these items were not edited nor garbled but appeared\r\nexactly as I had written them, boxed and doubleleaded on page one.\r\nThough the matter was really trivial and in confessing it I don't mind\r\nadmitting all of us are subject to petty vanities I was gratified to\r\nnotice too that Le ffaçasé had the discernment to realize how much the\r\npublic appreciated my handling the news about the grass, for he\r\nadvertised my contributions lavishly.\r\n\r\nIn my news stories I could tell no less than the full truth, which was\r\nthat the grass, after remaining patriotically dormant throughout the war\r\nexcept for the spurt northward to destroy the remnants of the invading\r\nhost, had once more set out upon the march. The loss of color I had\r\npointed out to Joe was less apparent each day of our stay as the old\r\nvividness revived with its renewed energy and the sweet music which\r\nentranced him gave place to the familiar crackling, growing louder with\r\neach foot it advanced down the slope, culminating every so often in\r\nthunderous explosions.\r\n\r\nFor down the thousand mile incline of the Mississippibasin it was\r\npouring with accelerating tempo, engulfing or driving everything before\r\nit. It was the old story of the creeping stolons, the steppedup tangled\r\nmass and the great, towering bulk behind; the falling forward and then\r\nthe continued headway. Once more the eastbound trains and highways\r\nclogged with refugees.\r\n\r\nMy affairs not permitting a longer stay, I returned to New York, but I\r\ncould not pry Joe from his preoccupation. \"A W,\" he argued, \"I'd be no\r\nmore use to Consolidated Pemmican right now than groundglass in a ham\r\nsandwich. My backside might be in a swivelchair, but my soul would be\r\nright up here. It's Whitman translated visibly and tangibly, A W, 'Come\r\nlovely and soothing death, undulate round and round.' Besides, youve got\r\nthe Old Man now, he's worth more to you than I ever will be; he loves\r\nbusiness. It's just like the army--without a doddering old generalstaff\r\nto pull him back every time he gets enthusiastic.\"\r\n\r\nIf anyone else in my organization had talked like this I would have\r\nfired him immediately, but I was sure down underneath his aesthetic\r\nposes and artistic pretensions there was a foundation of good\r\ncommonsense inherited from the general. Give the boy his head, I\r\nthought; let him stay here and rhapsodize till he gets sick of it; he'll\r\ncome back the better executive for having got it out of his system.\r\nAlso, as he himself pointed out, I had his father to rely on and he was\r\na man to whip up production if ever there was one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_50._ The chief purpose of my visit to the grass was, at least\r\nmomentarily, a failure. There was little point sampling and analyzing\r\nthe weed for its possible use as an ingredient in a food concentrate if\r\nit were impossible to set up a permanent place to gather and process it.\r\nI won't say I considered my time wasted, but its employment had not been\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nBut even immersed in the everexpanding affairs of Consolidated Pemmican\r\nand Allied Industries, as we now called the parent company, I could not\r\nget away from the grass. Each hour's eastward thrust was reported in\r\ndetail by an hysterical radio and every day the newspapers printed maps\r\nshowing the newly overrun territory. Once more the grass was the most\r\nprominent thought in men's minds, not only over the land of its being,\r\nbut throughout the world. Scientists of every nationality studied it at\r\nfirsthand and only strict laws and rigid searches by customs inspectors\r\nprevented the importation of specimens for dissection in their own\r\nlaboratories.\r\n\r\nThe formula of Miss Francis, now at length revealed in its entirety, was\r\ndiscussed by everyone. There was hardly a man, woman or child who did\r\nnot dream of finding some means to destroy or halt the grass and thereby\r\nmake of himself an unparalleled benefactor. A new crop of suggestions\r\nwas harvested by the _Intelligencer_; in addition to the old they\r\nincluded such expedients as reinoculating the grass with the\r\nMetamorphizer in the hope either of its cannibalistically feeding upon\r\nitself or becoming so infected with giantism as to blow up and\r\nburst--the failure of the experiment on the Russian steppes was ignored\r\nor forgotten by these contributors; building barriers of dryice; and the\r\nuse of infrared lamps.\r\n\r\nOne of the proposals which tickled the popular imagination was a plan\r\nfor vast areas to be roofed and glassenclosed, giant greenhouses to\r\noffer refuge for mankind in the very teeth of the grass. Artesian wells\r\ncould be sunk, it was argued, power harnessed to the tides of the sea\r\nand piped underground, the populace fed by means of concentrates or\r\nhydroponic farming. Everyone--except those in authority, the ones who\r\nwould have to approve the expenditure of the vast sums necessary--thought\r\nthere was something in the idea, but nothing was done about it.\r\n\r\nMany, believing physical means could be of little avail, suggested\r\nmetaphysical ones, and these were always punctiliously printed by the\r\n_Intelligencer_. They ranged from disregarding the existence of the weed\r\nand carrying on ordinary life as though it presented no threat, through\r\nHolding the Correct Thought, praying daily for its miraculous\r\ndisappearance, preferably at a simultaneous moment, to reorganizing the\r\nspiritual concepts of the human totality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_51._ But even without the newspapers George Thario would have kept me\r\ninformed. \"Piteous if not too comprehensive for small emotions,\" he\r\nwrote in a letter only a little more intelligible than the stuff in his\r\nnotebooks. \"Yesterday I stopped by a small farm or ranch as local\r\ngrandiloquence everseeking purple justification has it here. Submarginal\r\nland the tabulating minds of governmentofficials (spectacles precise on\r\nnosebridge, daily ration of exlax safe in briefcase) would have labeled\r\nit, sitting in expectant unease on hilltops and the uncomfortable slopes\r\nbetween. Dryfarming; the place illegally acquired from cattlerange (more\r\nproper and more profitable) by nester grandsire; surviving drought and\r\nduststorm, locust, weevil, and straying herds; feeding rachitic kids,\r\ndull women and helpless men for halfacentury.\r\n\r\n\"The Farm Resettlement Administration would have moved them to fatter\r\nground a hundred times, but blindly obstinate they held to what was\r\ntheirs and yet not theirs. In the frontseat the man and wife and what\r\nremained of quick moments of dropjawed ecstasy, in back unwieldly\r\nchickencoop, slats patched with bits of applebox and wire, weathered\r\ngray; astonished cocks crowing out of time and hens heads down. Hitched\r\nbehind, the family cow, stiffribbed and emptyuddered. The grass, deaf\r\nlover, had seized the shack, its fingers curled the solid door, body\r\npressed forward for joyful rape. The nesters don't look back but pant\r\nahead; the bumping of the car accommodates the cow.\r\n\r\n\"Ive had to leave the lodge of course and spend my nights in a thin\r\nhouse with a roof shaped like two playingcards, with the misleading\r\nsign, in punishment crippled, half fallen from its support, 'Tourists\r\nAccommodated' (if accommodation be empty spaces with mottoes and\r\nporcelain pisspots then punishment was unrighteous). I shall move on\r\nsoon, perhaps for the worse since there is green now, beneath the blue.\r\n\r\n\"If I can ever come away I shall, but I'd not miss this gladiator show,\r\nthis retiarii swing.\r\n\r\n\"Give my best to the Old Boy--tell him I'd write direct, but family\r\nfeeling makes it hard. Joe.\"\r\n\r\nI showed the letter to the general, expecting him perhaps to be annoyed\r\nby Joe's instability, but he merely said, \"Boy shouldnt be wasting his\r\ntalents ... put it in sound ... orchestrate it.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Joe's enthusiasm covered only one aspect of the grass so his\r\nretreat from lodge to wayside hostel, to city hotel, embraced only a\r\nminute sector of the great advance. Neither moral nor brute force slowed\r\nthe weed. It clutched the upper reaches of the Rio Grande and ran down\r\nits course to the Gulf of Mexico like quicksilver in a broken\r\nthermometer. It went through Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas; it nibbled\r\nat the forks of the Platte; it left behind the Great Salt Lake like a\r\nchip diamond lost in an enormous setting.\r\n\r\nThere is no benefit to be derived from looking at the darker side of\r\nthings and indeed it is a universal observation that there is no\r\nmisfortune without its compensation. The loss of the great cattlegrazing\r\nareas of the West increased the demand for our concentrated foods by the\r\nhundredfold. We paid no duty on the products shipped in from our South\r\nAmerican factories for they competed only with ourselves and we did the\r\ncountry the humanitarian service of preventing a famine by rushing\r\ncarload after carload westward, rising above all thoughts of petty gain\r\nby making no increase whatever in our prices despite the expanding\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_52._ About this time it became indisputable that Button Gwynnet Fles\r\nwas no longer of value to Consolidated Pemmican. His Yankee shrewdness\r\nand caution which enabled him to run the corporation when it was merely\r\na name and a quotation on the stockmarket had the limits of its virtues.\r\nHe was extraordinarily provincial in outlook and quite unable to see the\r\nconcern on a world scale. In view of our vast expansion such narrowness\r\nhad become an unbearable hindrance.\r\n\r\nI had permitted him to hold a limited number of shares and to act\r\nnominally as secretary in order to comply with the regulations of the\r\nSecurity and Exchange Commission, but now it was expedient to add to our\r\nofficers directors of other companies whose fields were complementary to\r\nours. Besides, in General Thario I had a much abler assistant and so,\r\nperhaps reluctantly because of my oversensitivity, I displaced Fles and\r\nmaking the general president of the corporation I accepted the post of\r\nchairman of the board.\r\n\r\nI must say he took a perfectly natural business move with unbecoming\r\nillgrace. \"It was mine, Mr Weener, you know it was mine and I did not\r\nprotest when you stole it; I worked loyally and unselfishly for you. It\r\nisnt the money, Mr Weener, really it isnt--it's the idea of being thrown\r\nout of my own business. At least let me stay on the Board of Directors;\r\nyoull never have any trouble from me, I promise you that.\"\r\n\r\nIt distressed me to reject his abject plea, but my hands were tied by my\r\ndevotion to the welfare of the company. Besides, he annoyed me by his\r\npalpably untrue reference to what had been a legitimate transaction,\r\nnever giving a thought to my generosity in not exposing his chicanery,\r\nnor the fact that the dummy he manipulated bore no resemblance whatever\r\nto the firm I had brought by my own effort to its present size.\r\n\r\nLeaving matters in the able hands of General Thario, after warning Joe\r\nhe had better soon return to his father's assistance, I went abroad to\r\narrange for wider European representation. There I found a curious\r\neagerness to be of help to me and almost fawning servility antipathetic\r\nto my democratic American notions. Oddly enough, the Europeans looked\r\nupon the United States as a doomed country, thinking I, like some\r\nmembers of our wealthier classes, had come to escape disruption and\r\ndislocation at home. Only in England did I find the belief prevalent\r\nthat the Americans would somehow muddle through because afterall theyre\r\nthe same sort of chaps we are, you know.\r\n\r\nAfter a highly successful trip I returned home the same day the Grass\r\nreached the headwaters of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n_53._ William Rufus Le ffaçasé astonished me, as well as every\r\nnewspaperman in the country by resigning as editor of the _Daily\r\nIntelligencer_, a post he had held before many of its reporters were\r\nborn. When I phoned him to come to my office and explain himself he\r\nrefused, in tones and manner I had not heard from any man since the days\r\nwhen I had wasted my talents as a subordinate. Having none of the\r\npettiness of pride which makes some men fearful of their position, since\r\nhe would not come to my office, I went to his. There he shocked me for\r\nthe third time: a high, glossy collar, a flowing and figured cravat\r\nconcealed the famous diamond stud, while instead of the snuffbox his\r\nhands hovered over a package of cheap cigarettes.\r\n\r\n\"Weener,\" he rasped, jettisoning all those courtesies to which I had\r\nbecome accustomed, \"I never thought I'd be glad to see your vapid face\r\nagain, unless on a marble slab in some city morgue, but now youre here,\r\nmoneybags slapping the insides of your thighs in place of the scrotum\r\nfor which you could have no possible use, I am delighted to tell you in\r\nperson to take my paper--my paper, sir, note that well, for all your\r\ndirty pawings could not make it anything but mine--and supposit it. I\r\nhope it frets you, Weener, for the sake of your sniveling but immortal\r\nsoul, I sincerely hope it rasps you like a misplaced hairshirt. You will\r\nget some miserable lickspittle to take my place, some mangy bookkeeping\r\npimp with a permanentwaved wife and three snottynosed brats, but the\r\nspirit and guts of the _Intelligencer_ depart with W R Le ffaçasé.\"\r\n\r\nI disregarded both his illmanners and his bombast. \"What's the matter,\r\nBill?\" I asked kindly, \"Is it more money? You can write your own ticket,\r\nyou know. Within reason, of course.\"\r\n\r\nHis fingers looked for the snuffbox, but found only the cigarettes which\r\nhe inspected puzzledly. \"Weener, no man could do you justice. You are\r\nthe bloody prototype of all the arselickers, panders, arsonists,\r\nkidnapers, cutthroats, pickpockets, abortionists, pilferers, cheats,\r\nforgers, sneakthieves, sharpers and blackmailers since Jacob swindled\r\nhis brother. Do not fawn upon me little man, I am too old to want women\r\nor money. The sands are running out and I shall never now read the\r\nimmortable Hobbes, but I'll not die in your bloody harness. In me you do\r\nnot see the man who picked up the torch of Franklin and Greeley and Dana\r\nwhere Henry Watterson dropped it. Loose of your gangrenous chains, you\r\nbehold the freelance correspondent of the North American Newspaper\r\nAlliance, the man who will devote his declining years to reporting in\r\nthe terse and vivid prose for which he is justly famous the progress of\r\nthe grass which strangles the country as you have tried to strangle me.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I put personal feelings aside. \"If your mind is really made up,\r\nwe'll want your stuff for the _Intelligencer_, Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, you may want. I hope the condition persists.\"\r\n\r\nThere being no profit in arguing with a madman, I made arrangements to\r\nreplace him immediately. I reproduce here, not for selfjustification,\r\nwhich would be superfluous, but merely for what amusement it may afford,\r\none of his accounts which appeared in the columns of so many third and\r\nfourth rate newspapers. I won't say it shows the decay of a once\r\npossibly great mind, but it certainly reveals that the _Intelligencer_\r\nsuffered no irreparable loss.\r\n\r\n\"Today at Dubuque, Iowa, the Mississippi was crossed. Not by redmen in\r\ncanoes, nor white on logs or clumsy rafts, nor yet by multiwheeled\r\nlocomotives gliding over steel bridges nor airplanes so high the wide\r\nstream was a thread below. Nature and devastation, hand in hand, for the\r\nmoment one and the same, crossed it today as Quantrell or Kirby Smith or\r\nNathan Bedford Forrest crossed it, sabers glittering, so many forgotten\r\nyears ago. But if the men in gray and butternut raided a store or burned\r\na tavern they thought it a mighty victory and went home rejoicing; the\r\ngreen invader is an occupier and colonizer, come to remain for all time,\r\nleaving no town, no road, no farm where it has passed.\r\n\r\n\"A few weeks ago Dubuque was still here, quiet, old and pleasant, the\r\nbutt of affectionate jokes, the Grass still miles away, the population\r\nstill hopeful of salvation. And then, because of the panic, the frantic\r\nscurry to save things once valuable and now only valued, no one noticed\r\nwhen a betraying wind blew seeds beyond the town, over the river, to\r\nfind receptive soil on the Wisconsin side. The seeds germinated, the\r\nclump flourished. It cut the highway and reached down the banks into the\r\nMississippi, waiting. And while it waited it built up greater bulk for\r\nitself, behind and beside. Each day it pushed a little farther toward\r\nmidstream, drowning its own foremost runners so those behind might have\r\nsolidity to advance upon.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile from the west the continent imposed upon a continent came\r\ncloser. The other day Dubuque went, its weathered bricks and immature\r\nstucco alike obliterated. The Grass ran out like a bather on a cold\r\nmorning, hastening to the water before timidity halts him. Although I\r\nwas watching I could not tell you at what exact instant the gap was\r\nclosed, at what moment the runners from one clump intertwined with those\r\nof the other. But such a moment did occur, and shedding water like a\r\nsurfacing whale the united bodies rose from the riverbed to form a\r\nverdant bridge.\r\n\r\n\"You could not walk across it, at least no man I know would want to try,\r\nbut it gives the illusion of permanency no work of man, stone or steel\r\nor concrete, has ever given and it is a dismaying thing to see man's\r\ntrade taken over by nature in this fashion.\r\n\r\n\"The bridge is a dam also. All the debris from the upper reaches\r\ncollects against it and soon there will be floods to add to the other\r\ndistress the Grass has brought. More than half the country is gone now:\r\nthe territories pillaged from Mexico, argued from Britain, bought from\r\nFrance, have all been lost. Only the original states and Florida remain.\r\nShall we be more successful in defending our basic land than all the\r\nacquisitions of a century and a half?\"\r\n\r\nBut why add any more? Dry, senile, without feeling, my only wonder was\r\nthat his stuff was printed, even in the obscure media where it appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_54._ With twothirds of the country absorbed and a hundred fifty million\r\npeople squeezed into what was left, economic conditions became worse\r\nthan ever. No European ghetto was as crowded as our cities and no\r\noverpopulated countryside farmed so intensively to so little purpose. An\r\nalmost complete cessation of employment except in the remnant of the\r\nexport trade, valueless money--English shillings and poundnotes\r\nillegally circulated being the prized medium of exchange--starvation\r\nonly irritated rather than relieved by the doles of food seized from the\r\nfarmers and grudgingly handed out to the urban dwellers.\r\n\r\nEach election saw another party in power, the sole demand of the voters\r\nbeing for an administration capable of stopping the Grass. Since none\r\nwas successful, the dissatisfaction and anger grew together with the\r\npanic and dislocation. Messiahs and fuehrers sprang up thickly. Riots in\r\nall cities were daily occurrences, rating no more than obscure\r\nparagraphs, while in many areas gangs of hoodlums actually maintained\r\nthemselves in power for weeks at a time, ruling their possessions like\r\nfeudal baronies and exacting tribute from all travelers through their\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nImmigration had long ago been stopped, but now the government, in order\r\nto preserve what space was left for genuine Americans, canceled the\r\nnaturalization of all foreignborn and ordered them immediately deported.\r\nAll Jews who had been in the country less than three generations were\r\nshipped to Palestine and the others deprived of political rights in\r\norder to encourage them to leave also. The Negroes, who except for a\r\nperiod less than a decade in length had never had any political or civil\r\nrights, planned a mass migration to Africa, a project enthusiastically\r\nspurred by such elder statesmen as the learned Maybank and the judicious\r\nRankin. This movement proved abortive when statisticians showed there\r\nwere not enough liquid assets among the colored population to pay a\r\nprofit on their transportation.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to oust all Catholics failed also, for the rather odd reason\r\nthat many of the minor Protestant sects joined in a body to oppose it.\r\nThe Latterday Saints--now busy building New Deseret in Central\r\nAustralia--and the Church of Christ, Scientist, as well as the\r\nEpiscopalians, Doweyites, Shakers, Christadelphians, and the\r\ncongregation of the Chapel of the Former and Latter Rains presented a\r\nunited front for tolerance and equity.\r\n\r\nAn astonishing byproduct of the national despair and turmoil was the\r\nfeverish activity in all fields of creative endeavor. Novels streamed\r\nfrom the presses, volumes of poetry became substantial items on\r\npublishers' lists and those which failed to find a publisher were\r\nmimeographed and peddled to a receptive public, while painters working\r\nwith Renascence enthusiasm turned out great canvases as fast as their\r\nbrushes could spread the oils. We had suddenly become a nation madly\r\ndevoted to the arts. When Orpheus Crisodd's Devilgrass Symphony was\r\nfirst played in Carnegie Hall an audience three times as great as that\r\nadmitted had to be accommodated outside with loudspeakers and when the\r\nawesome crescendo of horns, drums, and broken crockery rubbed over slate\r\nsurfaces announced the climax of the sixth movement, the crowds wept.\r\nEven for Mozart the hall was full, or practically full.\r\n\r\nIn the lively arts the impact of the Grass was more overt. On the\r\ncomicpage, Superman daily pushed it back and there was great regret his\r\nactivities were limited to a fourcolor process, while Terry Lee and\r\nFlash Gordon, everinspirited by the sharp outlines of mammaryglands,\r\nalso saved the country. Even Lil Abner and Snuffy Smith battled the\r\nvegetation while no one but Jiggs remained absolutely impervious. The\r\n_Greengrass Blues_ was heard on every radio and came from every\r\nadolescent's phonograph until it was succeeded by _Itty Bitty Seed Made\r\nAwfoo Nasty Weed_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable feature of this period was a preoccupation with\r\npermanency. Jerrybuilding, architectural mode since the first falsefront\r\nwas erected over the first smalltown store, practically disappeared. The\r\nskyscrapers were no longer steel skeletons with thin facings of stone\r\nhung upon them like a slattern's apron, while the practice of daubing\r\nmud on chickenwire hastily laid over paper was discontinued. Everyone\r\nwanted to build for all time, even though the Grass might seize upon\r\ntheir effort next week. In New York the Cathedral of St John the Divine\r\nwas finally completed and a new one dedicated to St George begun. The\r\ndemand for enduring woods replaced the market for green pine and men\r\nplanned homes to accommodate their greatgrandchildren and not to attract\r\nprospective buyers before the plaster cracked.\r\n\r\nNaturally, forwardlooking men like Stuart Thario and myself, though we\r\nhad every respect for culture, were not swamped by this sudden urge to\r\nencourage the effervescent side of life. Our feet were still upon the\r\nground and though we knew symphonies and novels and cathedrals had their\r\nplace, it was important not to lose sight of fundamentals; while we\r\napproved in principle the desire for permanency, we took reality into\r\naccount. We had every faith in the future of the country, being certain\r\na way would be found before long to stop the encroachments of the weed;\r\nnevertheless, as a proper precaution--a safeguarding counterbalance to\r\nour own enthusiastic patriotism--we invested our surplus funds in\r\nConsols and European bonds, while hastening our plans for new factories\r\non other continents.\r\n\r\nI'm sure George Thario must have been a great cross to his father\r\nalthough the general never spoke of him save in the most affectionate\r\nterms. Living like a tramp--he sent a snapshot once showing him with a\r\nlong starveling beard, dressed in careless overalls, his arm over the\r\nshoulder of a slovenly looking girl--he stayed always on the edge of the\r\nadvancing weed, moving eastward only when forced. He wrote from Galena:\r\n\r\n\"Eagle forgotten. The rejected accepted, for yesterday's eagle is\r\ntoday's, the hero is man and man his own hero. I was with him when he\r\ndied and when he died again and a hundred miles to the south is another\r\neagle forgotten and all the prairies, green once more, will be as they\r\nwere before men insulted them. O eagle forgotten. O stained prairie, O\r\ngallows, thirsty mob, knife, torch, revolver. Contumely, parochialism,\r\nthe shortvision forever gone; and the long vision too, the eagle\r\nforgotten is the national bird, the great merging with the greater, so\r\ngained too late a vision and saw the hope that was despair.\r\n\r\n\"I named the catalogue of states and the great syllables rolled from my\r\ntongue to echo silence. My sister, my bride. Gone and gone; the\r\nConestoga wagons have no more faint ruts to follow, the Little Big Horn\r\nis a combination of letters, the marking sunflowers exist no more. We\r\ndestroyed, we preempted; we are destroyed and we have been thrust out.\r\nIllinois admitted to the Union on suchandsuch a date, the Little Giant\r\nrubbed stubby fingers through pompous hair heavy with beargrease, the\r\nHonorable Abe in Springfield's most expensive broadcloth, necktie in the\r\nlatest mode but pulled aside to free an eager adamsapple; the drunken\r\ntanner, punctual with the small man's virtues, betrayed and dying\r\npainfully with so much blood upon his hands; and the eagle himself,\r\nforgotten and now again forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"I move once more. Step by step I give it up, the land we took and the\r\nland we made. Each foot I resign leaves the rest more precious. O\r\nprecious land, O dear and fruitful soil. Its clods are me, I eat them,\r\ngive them back; the bond is indissoluble. Even the land gone is still\r\nmine, my bones rest in it, I have eaten of its fruits and laid my mark\r\non it....\"\r\n\r\nAll of which was a longwinded way of saying the Grass was overrunning\r\nIllinois. In contrast I cannot forbear to quote Le ffaçasé, though his\r\nfaults, at the opposite end of the scale, were just as glaring: \"It is\r\nin Kentucky now, birthstate of Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth president of\r\nthe United States, a country which once stretched south of the\r\nForty-ninth Parallel from the Atlantic to the Pacific. I have been\r\ntraveling extensively in what is left of Lincoln's nation. 'Dukes,'\r\nremarked Chesterton, 'don't emigrate.' This country was settled by the\r\npoor and thriftless and now few more than the poor and thriftless remain\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try to present an overall picture: What is left of the country\r\nhas become a nineteenth century Ireland, with all economic power in the\r\nhands of absentees. It is not that everyone below the level of a\r\nmillionaire is too stupid to foresee possibility of complete\r\ndestruction; or the middle and lower classes virtuously imbued with such\r\nfanatical patriotism they are prepared for mass suicide rather than\r\nleave. Because dukes _are_ emigrating and sending the price of\r\nshippingspace into brackets which make the export of any commodity but\r\ndiamonds or their own hides a dubious investment, even the pawning of\r\nall the family assets would not buy steerage passage for a year old\r\nbaby. Besides there are not enough bottoms in the world to transport a\r\nhundred and fifty million people. If the Grass is not stopped, except\r\nfor a negligible few, it will cover Americans when it covers America.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder a strange and conflicting spirit animates our people. Apathy?\r\nYes, there is apathy; you can see it on the faces in a line of relief\r\nclients wondering how long an industrially stagnant country can continue\r\ntheir dole--even though now it consists of nothing but unpalatable\r\nchemicals--socalled 'Concentrates.' Despair? Certainly. The riots and\r\nlootings, especially the intensified ones recently in Cleveland and\r\nPittsburgh, are symptoms of it. The overcrowded churches, the terrific\r\nincrease in drugging and drinking, the sex orgies which have been taking\r\nplace practically in the open in Baltimore and Philadelphia and Boston\r\nare stigmata of desperation.\r\n\r\n\"Hope? I suppose there is hope. Congress sits in uninterrupted session\r\nand senators lend their voices night and day to the destruction of the\r\nGrass. The Federal Disruptions Commission has published the eleventh\r\nvolume of its report and is currently holding hearings to determine how\r\nclosely the extinct buffalograss is related to _Cynodon dactylon_. Every\r\nresearch laboratory in the country, except those whose staffs and\r\nequipment have been moved with their proprietary industries, is\r\nexpending its energies in seeking a salvation.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps only in the Deep South, as yet protected by the width of the\r\nlower Mississippi, is there something approaching a genuine hope,\r\nalthough ironically that may be the product of ignorance. Here the\r\noverlords have gone and the poor whites, unsupported by an explicit\r\nkinship, have withdrawn into complete listlessness. Some black men have\r\nfled, but to most the Grass is a mere bogey, incapable of frightening\r\nthose who have survived so much. Now, for the first time since 1877 the\r\npolls are open to all and there are again Negro governors, and black\r\nlegislatures. And they are legislating as if forever. Farm tenancy has\r\nbeen abolished, the great plantations have been expropriated and made\r\ncooperative, the Homestead Act of 1862 has been applied in the South and\r\nevery citizen is entitled to claim a quartersection. There is a great\r\ndeal of laughter at this childish lawmaking, but it goes on, changing\r\nthe face of the region, the lawmakers themselves not at all averse to\r\nthe joke.\"\r\n\r\nEverything Le ffaçasé wrote was not only dull, but biased and unjust as\r\nwell. It was true capital was leaving the country rapidly, but what\r\nother course had it? To stay and attempt to carry on industry in the\r\nmidst of the demoralization was obviously impractical. The plants\r\nremained and when a way was found to conquer the Grass we would be glad\r\nto reopen them, for this would be a practical course, just as the flight\r\nof capital was a practical course; standards of living were now so\r\nreduced in the United States it would be more profitable to employ cheap\r\nAmerican labor than overpaid Latin or European.\r\n\r\n\r\n_55._ I had now no fixed abode, dividing my time between Rio and Buenos\r\nAires, Melbourne and Manchester. General Thario and his family lived in\r\nCopenhagen, overseeing our continental properties, now of equal\r\nimportance with the South American holdings. Before leaving, and indeed\r\non every trip back home, he visited his son--no easy thing to do, what\r\nwith the young man's constant movement and the extreme difficulty of\r\ngoing from east to west against the torrent pouring in the opposite\r\ndirection. Joe had married the female of the snapshot, or contracted\r\nsome sort of permanent alliance with her--I never got it quite straight\r\nand the Tharios were deplorably careless about such details; and she\r\nproved as eccentric as he was. No appeal to selfinterest, no pleading he\r\nforgo his morbid preoccupation with the Grass for the sake of his\r\nfamily, could move them.\r\n\r\n\"A W--you have seen it, heard it, smelled it. Can't you\r\nexplain--miraculously touched with the gift of lucidity for fact as you\r\nare for the fictions of production, overhead and dividends? Oh, not to\r\nMama--either she understands better than I or not at all--but to the Old\r\nMan or Connie?\r\n\r\n\"As a child you learn for the first time of death: the heart is\r\nshuttered in a little cell, too cruel for breathing; the sun is gray. In\r\nan instant you forget; the sky is bright; the blood pounds. Years later\r\nthe adolescent falls in love with death; primps his spirit for it;\r\nrecalls in unpresumptuous brotherhood Shelley and Keats and Chatterton.\r\nAfterward the flush fades; we are reconciled to life, but the promise is\r\nstill implicit. Now, however, it must be earned, awaited. Haste would\r\ndestroy the savor. The award assured, pace becomes dignified.\r\n\r\n\"But death is not death; life is never mocked. The Grass is not death\r\nany more than it is evil. The Grass is the Grass. It is me and I am it;\r\n'in my father's house there are many mansions, if it were not so I would\r\nnot have told you.'\r\n\r\n\"No, I suppose not; yet it hurts my liver to offer the old boy\r\nincomprehensible reasons or verbiage like 'compulsion neurosis' when all\r\nhe wants is to protect me from my own impulses as he protected me from\r\nthe army. Florence and I delight in him--he comes again next week if\r\npossible--but we cannot convey to him the unthinkableness of\r\nleaving....\"\r\n\r\nI heard about this visit later from the general. Joe had scoured Chicago\r\nfor the alcoholic commodities now practically unprocurable, and returned\r\nin triumph to the couple's furnished room. There they entertained him\r\nwith two bottles of cointreau and a stone demijohn of cornwhisky.\r\n\"Touched ... filial affection ... even drank the cointreau--fiddling\r\nstuff, no wonder it was still available in the drought ... better son a\r\nman never had....\r\n\r\n\"Girl's all right. Moved in circles ... perhaps not accustomed ... bit\r\nrough in speech, but heart of gold ... give you the shirt right off her\r\nback ... hum ... manner of speaking ... know what I mean....\"\r\n\r\nBut she would not add her persuasions to those of the general. \"Joe's\r\ngot to stay. It's not something he sat down and thought up, the way you\r\nplan dinner or whether blue goes good with your new permanent. He's got\r\nto stay because he's got to stay. And of course, so do I. We couldnt be\r\nsatisfied anywhere we couldnt see the Grass. Life's too dull away from\r\nit ... but of course that's only part--it's too big to explain....\"\r\n\r\n\"But George--Joe as you call him ... highly talented ... sensitive ...\r\nshouldnt be allowed to decay,\" the general argued. \"Fascination ...\r\nunderstand, but effort of will ... break the spell. Europe ...\r\nbirthplace of culture ... reflection ... give him a proper perspective\r\n... chance to do things....\"\r\n\r\nEven when the evening lengthened and he became more lucid under the\r\nstimulus of cornwhisky and cointreau he could not shake them. \"Judicious\r\nretreat, especially in the face of overwhelming superiority, has always\r\nbeen a military weapon and no captain, no matter how valiant, has ever\r\nfeared to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pop,\" George Thario had retorted goodhumoredly, \"you dragged in the\r\nmetaphor, not I. Youve heard of the Alamo and Vicksburg and Corregidor?\r\nWell, this is them--all rolled into one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_56._ The first snows of this ominous winter halted progress of the\r\nGrass. It went sluggish and then dormant first in the far north, where\r\nonly the quick growingseason, once producing cabbages big as hogsheads,\r\nhad allowed it to spread at a rate at all comparable to its progress\r\nfarther south. But by now there could be no doubt left that _Cynodon\r\ndactylon_, once so sensitive to cold that it had covered itself, even in\r\nthe indistinguishable Southern California winter, with a protective\r\nsheath, had become inured to frost and chill, hibernating throughout the\r\nseverest cold and coming back vigorously in the spring.\r\n\r\nIt now extended from Alaska to Hudson Bay, covering all Manitoba and\r\nparts of Ontario. It had taken to itself Minnesota, the northern\r\npeninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, a great chunk of Illinois, and stood\r\nbaffled on the western bank of the Mississippi from Cairo to its mouth.\r\nThe northwestern, underpopulated half of Mexico was overrun, the Grass\r\nmoving but sluggishly into the estados bordering the Gulf Coast.\r\n\r\nI cannot say this delusive safety was enjoyed, for there was\r\nunbelievable hardship. In spite of the great bulk of the country's\r\ncoalfields lying east of the Grass and the vast quantities of oil and\r\nnatural gas from Texas, there was a fuel famine, due largely to the\r\nbreakdown of the transportation system. People warmed themselves after a\r\nfashion by burning furniture and rubbish in improvised stoves. Of course\r\nthis put an additional strain on firedepartments, themselves suffering\r\nfrom the same lack of new equipment, tires, and gasoline, afflicting the\r\ngeneral public and great conflagrations swept through Akron, Buffalo and\r\nHartford. Garbage collection systems broke down and no attempt was made\r\nto clear the streets of snow. Broken watermains, gaspipes and sewers\r\nwere followed by typhus and typhoid and smallpox, flux, cholera and\r\nbubonic plague. The hundreds of thousands of deaths relieved only in\r\nsmall degree the overcrowding; for the epidemics displaced those\r\nrefugees sheltered in the schoolhouses, long since closed, when these\r\nwere made auxiliary to the inadequate hospitals.\r\n\r\nThe strangely inappropriate flowering of culture, so profuse the year\r\nbefore, no longer bloomed. A few invincible enthusiasts, mufflered and\r\nraincoated, still bore the icy chill of the concert hall, a quorum of\r\npainters besieged the artist supply stores for the precious remaining\r\ntubes of burntumber and scarletlake, while it was presumed that in\r\ntraditionally unheated garrets orthodox poets nourished their muse on\r\npencil erasers. But all enthusiasm was individual property, the reaction\r\nof single persons with excess adrenalin. No common interests united\r\ndoctor and stockbroker, steelworker and truckdriver, laborer and\r\nlaundryman, except common fear of the Grass, briefly dormant but ever in\r\nthe background of all minds. The stream of novels, plays, and poems\r\ndried up; publishers, amazed that what had been profitable the year\r\nbefore was no longer so, were finally convinced and stopped printing\r\nanything remotely literate; even the newspapers limped along crippledly,\r\ntheir presses breaking down hourly, their circulation and coverage alike\r\ndubious.\r\n\r\nThe streets were no more safe at night than in sixteenth century London.\r\nEven in the greatest cities the lighting was erratic and in the smaller\r\nones it had been abandoned entirely. Holdups by individuals had been\r\npractically given up, perhaps because of the uncertainty of any footpad\r\ngetting away with his loot before being hijacked by another, but small\r\ncompact gangs made life and property unsafe at night. Tempers were\r\nextraordinarily short; a surprised housebreaker was likely to add\r\nbattery, mayhem and arson to his crimes, and altercations which commonly\r\nwould have terminated in nothing more violent than lurid epithets now\r\nfrequently ended in murder.\r\n\r\nSince too many of the homeless took advantage of the law to commit petty\r\noffenses and so secure some kind of shelter for themselves, all law\r\nenforcement below the level of capital crimes went by default. Prisoners\r\nwere tried quickly, often in batches, rarely acquitted; and sentences of\r\ndeath were executed before nightfall so as to conserve both prison space\r\nand rations.\r\n\r\nIn rural life the descent was neither so fast nor so far. There was no\r\ngasoline to run cars or tractors, but carefully husbanded\r\nstoragebatteries still provided enough electricity to catch the news on\r\nthe radio or allow the washingmachine to do the week's laundry. To a\r\ngreat extent the farmer gave up his dependence on manufactured goods,\r\nexcept when he could barter his surplus eggs or milk for them, and\r\ninstead went back to the practices of his forefather, becoming for all\r\nintents and purposes practically selfsufficient. Soap from woodashes and\r\nleftover kitchen grease might scratch his skin and a jacket of rabbit or\r\nwolverine hide make him selfconscious, but he went neither cold nor\r\nhungry nor dirty while his urban counterpart, for the most part, did.\r\n\r\nOne contingency the countrydweller prepared grimly against: roaming\r\nhordes of the hungry from the towns, driven to plunder by starvation\r\nwhich they were too shiftless to alleviate by purchasing concentrates,\r\nfor sale everywhere. Shotguns were loaded, corncribs made tight, stock\r\nzealously guarded. But except rarely the danger had been overestimated.\r\nThe undernourished proletariat lacked the initiative to go out where the\r\nfood came from. Generations had conditioned them to an instinctive\r\nbelief that bread came from the bakery, meat from the butcher, butter\r\nfrom the grocer. Driven by desperation they broke into scantily supplied\r\nfood depots, but seldom ventured beyond the familiar pavements. Famine\r\ntook its victims in the streets; the farmers continued to eat.\r\n\r\nI arrived in New York on the clipper from London in mid-January of this\r\ndreadful winter. I had boarded the plane at Croydon, only subconsciously\r\naware of the drive from London through the traditionally neat\r\nhedgerows, of the completely placid and lawabiding England around me,\r\nthe pleasant officials, the helpful yet not servile porters. Long Island\r\nshocked me by contrast. It had come to its present condition by slow\r\ndegrees, but to the returning traveler the collapse was so woefully\r\nabrupt it seemed to have happened overnight.\r\n\r\nTension and hysteria made everyone volatile. The customs officials,\r\ncareless of the position of those whom they dealt with, either inspected\r\nevery cubic inch of luggage with boorish suspicion and resultant damage\r\nor else waved the proffered handbags airily aside with false geniality.\r\nThe highways, repeating a pattern I had cause to know so well, were\r\nnearly impassable with brokendown cars and other litter. The streets of\r\nQueens, cluttered with wreckage and refuse, were bounded by houses in a\r\nstate of apathetic disrepair whose filthy windows refused to look upon\r\nthe scene before them. The great bridges over the East River were not\r\nbeing properly maintained as an occasional snapped cable, hanging over\r\nthe water like a drunken snake, showed; it was dangerous to cross them,\r\nbut there was no other way. The ferryboats had long since broken down.\r\n\r\nAt the door of my hotel, where I had long been accustomed to just the\r\nright degree of courteous attention, a screaming mob of men and boys\r\nwrapped in careless rags to keep out the cold, their unwashed skins\r\nshowing where the coverings had slipped, begged abjectly for the\r\nprivilege of carrying my bags. The carpet in the lobby was wrinkled and\r\nsoiled and in the great chandeliers half the bulbs were blackened.\r\nThough the building was served by its own powerstation, the elevators no\r\nlonger ran, and the hot water was rationed, as in a fifthrate French\r\npension. The coverlet on the bed was far from fresh, the window was\r\ndusty and there was but one towel in the bathroom. I was glad I had not\r\nbrought my man along for him to sneer silently at an American luxury\r\nhotel.\r\n\r\nI picked up the telephone, but it was dead. I think nothing gave me the\r\nfeeling that civilization as we knew it had ended so much as the blank\r\nsilence coming from the dull black earpiece. This, even more than the\r\nautomobile, had been the symbol of American life and activity, the\r\nessential means of communication which had promoted every business deal,\r\nevery social function, every romance; it had been the first palliation\r\nof the sickbed and the last admission of the mourner. Without telephones\r\nwe were not even in the horse and buggy days--we had returned to the\r\noxcart. I replaced the receiver slowly in its cradle and looked at it a\r\nlong minute before going back downstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_57._ I had come home on a quixotic and more or less unbusinesslike\r\nmission. It had long been the belief of Consolidated Pemmican's chemists\r\nthat the Grass might possibly furnish raw material for food concentrates\r\nand we had come to modify our opinion about the necessity for a\r\nprocessing plant in close proximity. However, at secondhand, no\r\npracticable formula had been evolved. Strict laws against the\r\ntransportation of any specimens and even stricter ones barring them from\r\nevery foreign country made experiment in our main research laboratories\r\ninfeasible; but we still maintained a skeleton staff in our Jacksonville\r\nplant and I had come to arrange the collection of a large enough sample\r\nfor them to get to work in earnest. It was a tricky business and I had\r\nno one beside myself whom I could trust to undertake it except General\r\nThario, and he was fully occupied.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being illegal it also promised little profit, for while\r\ndislocation of the normal foodsupply made the United States our main\r\nmarket for concentrates, American currency had fallen so low--the franc\r\nstood at $5, the pound sterling at $250--it was hardly worthwhile to\r\nimport our products. Of course, as a good citizen, I didnt send American\r\nmoney abroad, content to purchase Rembrandts, Botticellis, Titians or El\r\nGrecos; or when I couldnt find masterpieces holding a stable price on\r\nthe world market, to change my dollars into some of the gold from Fort\r\nKnox, now only a useless bulk of heavy metal.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was Miss Francis. Though she had more or less dropped\r\nfrom public sight, my staff had ascertained she was living in a small\r\nSouth Carolina town. My telegrams remaining unanswered, there was\r\nnothing for me to do but undertake a trip there.\r\n\r\nDespite strict instructions my planes had not been kept in proper\r\ncondition and I had great difficulty getting mechanics to service them.\r\nThere were plenty of skilled men unemployed and though they were not\r\neager to earn dollars they were willing to work for other rewards. But\r\nthe pervading atmosphere of tension and anxiety made concentration\r\ndifficult; they bungled out of impatience, committed stupidities they\r\nwould normally be incapable of; they quit without cause, flew into rages\r\nat the machines, the tools, their fellows, fate, at or without the\r\nslightest provocation.\r\n\r\nMy pilot was surly and hilarious by turn and I suspected him of\r\ndrinking, which didnt add to my confidence in our safety. We flew low\r\nover railroadtracks stretching an empty length to the horizon, over\r\nsmokeless factorychimneys, airports whose runways were broken and whose\r\nlandinglights were dark. The land was green and rich, the industrial\r\nlife imposed upon it till yesterday had vanished, leaving behind it the\r\nbleaching skeleton of its being.\r\n\r\nThe field upon which we came down seemed in slightly better repair than\r\nothers we had sighted. The only other ship was an antique biplane which\r\ndeserved housing in a museum. As I looked around the deserted\r\nlandingstrip a tall Negro emerged leisurely from one of the buildings\r\nand walked toward us.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the airport officials?\" I asked rather sharply, for I didnt\r\nrelish being greeted by a janitor.\r\n\r\n\"I am the chief dispatcher. In fact, I am the entire personnel at the\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\nMy pilot, standing behind me, broke in. \"Boy, where're the white folks\r\naround here?\"\r\n\r\nThe chief dispatcher looked at him steadily a long moment before\r\nanswering. \"I imagine you will find people of various shades all over\r\ntown, including those allegedly white. Was there anyone in particular\r\nyou were interested in or are you solely concerned with pigmentation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you goddam--\"\r\n\r\nI thought it advisable to prevent a possible altercation. I recalled Le\r\nffaçasé's articles on the Black South which I had considered vastly\r\noverdrawn. Evidently they were not, for the chocolatecolored man spoke\r\nwith all the ease and assurance of unquestioned authority. \"I want to\r\nget to a Miss Francis at--\" I consulted my notes and gave him the\r\naddress. \"Can you get me a taxi or car?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gravely. \"We are without such luxuries at present, I regret to\r\nsay. But there will be a bus along in about twenty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been a long time since I suffered the wasted time and\r\ninconvenience of public transportation. However, there was no help for\r\nit and I resigned myself philosophically. I walked with the chief\r\ndispatcher into the airport waitingroom, dull with the listless air, not\r\nof unoccupancy, but disuse.\r\n\r\n\"Not much air travel,\" I remarked idly.\r\n\r\n\"Yours is the first plane in a month.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you bother to keep the airport open at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do what we can to preserve the forms of civilization. The substance,\r\nunfortunately, cannot be affected by transportation, production,\r\ndistribution, education or any other such niceties.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled inwardly. What children these black people were, afterall. I\r\nwas relieved from further ramblings by the arrival of the bus which was\r\nas laughable as the chief dispatcher's philosophizing. The dented and\r\nrusty vehicle had been disencumbered of its motor and was hitched to\r\nfour mules who seemed less than enthusiastic over their lot. I got in\r\nand seated myself gingerly on one of the dilapidated seats, noting that\r\nthe warning signs \"For White\" and \"For Colored\" had been smeared over\r\nwith just enough paint to make the intent of obliteration clear without\r\nactually doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_58._ How Miss Francis contrived to make every place she lived in,\r\napartment, chickenhouse or cottage, look exactly alike was remarkable.\r\nNothing is more absurd than the notion that socalled intellectual\r\nworkers are always alert--as Miss Francis demonstrated by her greeting\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Weener, what is it this time? Selling on commission or an\r\ninterview?\"\r\n\r\nIt was inconceivable any literate person in the United States could be\r\nignorant of my position. \"It is neither,\" I returned with some dignity.\r\n\"I am here to do you a favor. To help you in your work.\" And I explained\r\nmy proposition.\r\n\r\nShe squatted back on her heels and gave me that old, familiar, searching\r\nlook. \"So you have made a good thing out of the Metamorphizer afterall,\"\r\nshe said irrelevantly and untruthfully. \"Weener, you are a consistent\r\ncharacter--a beautifully consistent character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please come to the point, Miss Francis. I am a busy man and I have come\r\ndown here simply to see you. Will you accept?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if I could combine my research with your attempt to process the\r\ninoculated _Cynodon dactylon_. However, that would not prevent me from\r\ntaking you up and using you in order to further a good cause. But I am\r\nnot yet ready--I shall not be ready for some time, to go directly to the\r\nGrass. That must come later. No, Weener.\"\r\n\r\nI was exasperated at the softness of my impulse which had made me seek\r\nout this madwoman to do her a favor. I could not regret my charitable\r\nnature, but I mentally resolved to be more discriminating in future.\r\nBesides, the thought of Miss Francis for the work had been sheer\r\nsentimentality, the sort of false reasoning which would make of every\r\nmother an obstetrician or every hen an oologist.\r\n\r\nAs I sauntered through the drowsy streets, killing time till the driver\r\nof the ridiculous \"bus\" should decide to guide his mules back to the\r\nairport, I was struck by the lack of tension, of apprehension and\r\nanxiety, so apparent in New York. Evidently the Black South suffered\r\nlittle from the brooding fear and terror; I put it down to their\r\nchildish thoughtlessness.\r\n\r\nWalking thus reflectively, head down, I looked up suddenly--straight\r\ninto the face of the Strange Lady I had driven from Los Angeles to Yuma.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I opened my mouth, but no words came out. She was hurrying\r\nrapidly along, paying no attention either to me or to her surroundings,\r\naloof and exquisite. I think I put out my hand, or made some other\r\nreflexive gesture to stop her, but either she failed to notice or\r\nmisunderstood. When I finally recovered myself and set out after her,\r\nshe had vanished.\r\n\r\nI waited for the bus, wondering if I had been victim of an\r\nhallucination....\r\n\r\n\r\n_59._ In spite of Miss Francis' blindness to her own interest I still\r\nhad a prospective superintendent for the gathering and shipping of the\r\ngrass: George Thario. Unless his obsession had sent him down into\r\nMississippi or Louisiana, I expected to find him in Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nThe short journey west was tedious and uncomfortable, repeating the\r\npattern of the one southward. At the end of it there was no garrulous\r\nchief dispatcher, for the airport was completely deserted, and I was\r\nthankful for an ample stock of gas for the return flight.\r\n\r\nI had no difficulty locating Joe in an immense, highceilinged\r\nfurnishedroom in one of the ugliest gray weatherboarded houses, of which\r\nthe city, never celebrated for its architecture, could boast. The first\r\nthing to impress me was the room's warmth. For the first time since\r\nlanding I did not shiver. A woodfire burned in an open grate and a\r\nkerosene heater smelled obstinately in an opposite corner. A grandpiano\r\nstood in front of the long narrow windows and on it slouched several\r\nthick piles of curlyedged paper.\r\n\r\nHe greeted me with something resembling affection. \"The tycoon himself!\r\nWorkers of the world--resume your chains. A W, it's a pleasure to see\r\nyou. And looking so smooth and ordinary and unharassed too, at the\r\nmoment everyone else is tearing himself with panic or anguish. How do\r\nyou do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I look on the bright side of things, Joe,\" I answered. \"Worry never\r\nhelped anybody accomplish anything--and it takes fewer muscles to smile\r\nthan to frown.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear that, Florence?\"\r\n\r\nI had not noticed her when I came in, the original of the snapshot,\r\nsitting placidly in a corner darning socks. I must say the photograph\r\nhad done her less than justice, for though she was undoubtedly\r\ncommonlooking and sloppy, with heavy breasts and coarse red cheeks and\r\nunconcealedly dyed hair, there was yet about her an air of great\r\nvitality, kindness, and good nature. Parenthetically she acknowledged my\r\npresence with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\"You hear that? Remind me the next time I am troubled by a transposition\r\nor a solopassage that it takes less muscles to smile than to frown. For\r\nI have got to work at last, A W; the loafing and inviting of my soul is\r\npast, my soul has responded to my invitation. You remember Crisodd's\r\nDevilgrass Symphony? A horrible misconception if ever there was one, a\r\npersonal insult to anyone who ever saw the Grass; a dull, unintentional\r\njoke; bad Schoenberg--if that isnt a tautology--combined with faint\r\nmemories of the most vulgar Wagner--if that isnt another\r\ntautology--threaded together on _Mighty Like a Rose_ and _Alexander's\r\nRagtime Band_. But what am I saying, A W, to you who are so free from\r\nthe virus of culture? What the hell interest have you in Crisodd's\r\nsymphony or my symphony or anybody's symphony, except the polyphony of\r\nprofits?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope no one thinks I'm a narrowminded man, Joe,\" I reproved him. \"I\r\nventure to say I have as much interest in Art as the next person. Ive\r\ndone a bit of writing myself, you know, and literature--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh sure. I didnt mean to hurt your feelings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not. But while I believe Music is a fine thing in its place, I\r\ncame to discuss a different subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean taking Joe back to Europe with you, youre out of luck, Mr\r\nWeener,\" put in Florence placidly. \"He's almost finished the first\r\nmovement and we'll never leave the Grass till it's all done.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake me, Mrs Thario. I have a proposition for your husband, but\r\nfar from taking him away from the Grass, it will bring him closer to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible,\" exclaimed Joe. \"I am the Grass and the Grass is me; in\r\nmystical union we have become a single entity. I speak with its voice\r\nand in the great cadences which come from its heart you can hear\r\nThario's first, transfigured and magnified a hundred thousand times.\"\r\n\r\nI was sorry to note his speech, always so simple and unaffected in\r\ncontrast to his letters, was infected with an unbecoming pomposity.\r\nLooking at him closely I saw he had lost weight. His flesh had shrunk\r\ncloser to his big frame and the lines of his skull stood out sharply in\r\nhis cheek and jaw. There was the faintest touch of gray in his hair and\r\nhis fingers played nervously with the ragged and illadvised beard on his\r\nchin. He hardly looked the man who had evaded serious work in order to\r\nencourage a silly obsession, comfortably supported all the while by a\r\nsizable remittance from his father.\r\n\r\nI outlined to them my plans for gathering samples of the weed. Florence\r\ntucked her stillthreaded needle between her teeth and inspected the\r\ncurrent pair of socks critically. Joe walked over to the piano and\r\nstruck several discordant notes.\r\n\r\n\"I understand there are several parties making expeditions onto the\r\nGrass,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Lots,\" confirmed Joe. \"There's a group sent out by Brother Paul on some\r\nvery mysterious mission. It's called the Sanctification of the\r\nForerunner. God knows how many thousands he's made his suckers cough up,\r\nfor theyre equipped with all the latest gadgets for polar exploration,\r\nskis and dogsleds, moompitcher cameras, radios and unheardof quantities\r\nof your very best pemmican. They started as soon as the snow was thick\r\nenough to bear their weight and if we have an untimely thaw theyll go to\r\njoin the Russians.\r\n\r\n\"Then there's the government bunch, the Disruptions Commission having\r\nfinally and reluctantly produced an idea, but exactly what it is they\r\nhavent confided to an eager citizenry. Smaller groups too: scientists\r\nand nearscientists, enthusiasts who have got the notion somehow that\r\nanimals or migratory game are roaming the snow on top of the\r\ngrass--exactly how they got there is not explained--planning to\r\nphotograph, hunt or trap; and just plain folk making the trip for the\r\nhell of it. We might have gone ourselves if it hadnt been for the\r\nsymphony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your symphony is concerned with the Grass?\" I asked politely.\r\n\r\n\"It's concerned with combinations of sound.\" He looked at me sharply and\r\nbanged out harsher discords. \"With life, if you want to talk like a\r\nprogramnote.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you go on this expedition it will give you an opportunity to gather\r\nnew material,\" I pointed out.\r\n\r\n\"If I look out the window or consult my navel or 'meditate while at\r\nstool' or cut my finger I will get new material with much less hardship.\r\nThe last thing a composer or writer or painter needs is material; it is\r\nfrom excess of material he is the besotted creature he is. He may lack\r\nleisure or energy or ability or an active colon, but no masterpiece ever\r\nwas or conceivably could be thwarted from lack of material.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you have tied yourself to the Grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to prostitute it to whatever talents I have, but because it is the\r\nmost magnificent thing on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then of course youll go,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you go yourself, A W? Do you good to live out in the open.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't afford the time, Joe; I have too many things that need my\r\npersonal attention.\"\r\n\r\nHe struck a series of great thumping notes. \"And so have I, A W, so have\r\nI. I'm afraid youll have to get somebody else.\"\r\n\r\nI could neither understand nor shake his obstinacy and when I left them\r\nI had almost determined to abandon the whole project, for I could not\r\nthink whom else trustworthy I could get. His idea of my own\r\nparticipation was fantastic; I had long since come to the point where it\r\nwas necessary to delegate all such duties to subordinates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_60._ Perhaps it was Joe's sly remark about it doing me good to be out\r\nin the open, or the difficulty of getting a conveyance, but I decided to\r\nwalk to my hotel. Taxis of course disappeared with gasoline, but\r\ningenious men, unwilling to be pauperized by accepting the dole, had\r\ndevised rickshaws and bicycle carriages which were the only means of\r\nlocal transportation. The night was clear and cold, the stars gleaming\r\nin distant purity, but all around, the offensive smell of the disheveled\r\ncity played on my disgusted nostrils.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. Brother, are you saved?\"\r\n\r\nWhen the figure had come out from the shadow of a building to accost me\r\nmy first thought had been of a holdup, but the odd salutation made this\r\nseem unlikely. \"What do you want?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Brother, are you a Christian man?\"\r\n\r\nI resented the impertinence and started to walk on; he followed close\r\nbeside me. \"Harden not your heart, miserable sinner, but let Jesus\r\ndissolve your pride as he washes away your other sins. Be not high and\r\nmighty for the high shall be low and the mighty powerless; in a short\r\ntime you will be food for grass. The Grass is food for the Ox, the\r\ndivine Ox with seven horns which shall come upon the world with a great\r\ntrumpeting and bellowing soon after the Forerunner.\"\r\n\r\nI knew of the great multiplication of insanity and hoped I could reach\r\nthe hotel before he grew violent. \"What is your name?\" I temporized.\r\n\r\n\"Call me Brother Paul, for I was once Saul the worldly; now I am your\r\nbrother in Christ.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Paul! The radio preacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are all members one of another and He who watches the sparrow fall\r\nmakes no distinction between one manmade label and another. All of us\r\nwho have found Christ Jesus with the help of Brother Paul are called\r\nBrother Paul. Come to the Loving Arms, O miserable sinner, and be\r\nBrother Paul also.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it might be very confusing. \"I have always been interested in\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\n\"O puny man. Interested in life and interested in death, interested in\r\nbeing and interested in begetting, interested in religion and interested\r\nin dung. Turn from those interests which the devil pays upon your soul's\r\nmortgage; your Savior resides in the heart of the Grass--withhold not\r\nyour precious soul from Him. At this very moment the Forerunner is being\r\nsanctified and after her there will come the Ox to eat the Grass and\r\nthen the end of the world. Give Brother Paul your worthless earthly\r\npossessions, give your soul to Jesus and hasten that glorious day.\r\nHallelujah!\"\r\n\r\nThe fervid jumble ended in a near scream. What a waste of oratorical and\r\nperhaps organizational energy, I mused as I strode along rapidly, still\r\nintent on escaping the fanatic. Under different circumstances, I\r\nthought, a man like this might turn out to be a capable clerk or minor\r\nexecutive. Suddenly I had a hunch.\r\n\r\n\"Mr--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Paul. I have no earthly name.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish youd come with me for a few minutes; I have a proposition which\r\nmight interest you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the darkness I could see him peering at me suspiciously. \"Is this\r\nsome worldly seduction from the Christian path?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you will find what I have to offer a material aid to your\r\nchurch.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no church,\" he said. \"We are Christians and recognize no manmade\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to your movement or whatever you call it.\" In spite of his\r\nreluctance, which was now as great as mine had been originally, I\r\npersuaded him to accompany me. He sat uneasily forward while I told him\r\nwho I was and sketched the plan for collecting some of the Grass.\r\n\r\n\"What is this to me? I have long ago put aside all material thoughts and\r\nnow care only for the life of the spirit.\"\r\n\r\nThis must be true, I thought, noting his shabby clothes, sweatgreasy\r\nmuffler at once hiding and revealing lack of necktie, and cracked shoes,\r\none sock brown, the other black. \"It is this to you: if you don't want\r\nthe salary and bonus attached to organizing and superintending the\r\nexpedition--and I am prepared to be generous--you can turn it over to\r\nBrother Paul. I imagine it will be acceptable.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, muttering, \"Satan, Satan.\" The lower part of his face\r\nwas wide and divided horizontally, like an inverted jellymold. It\r\ntapered up into bracketing ears, supporting gingery eaves. I pressed\r\nhome my arguments.\r\n\r\n\"I will put your proposition to Brother Paul,\" he conceded at length.\r\n\r\n\"I thought distinctions between one man and another were worldly and\r\ntrivial,\" I prodded him. \"Arent you Brother Paul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Satan, Satan,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it could have been nothing but one of those flashes of\r\nintuition for which successful executives are noted which caused me to\r\npick this man in spite of his absurd ranting and illfavored appearance.\r\nNot intuition really, but an ability to evaluate and classify\r\npersonalities instantly. I always had this faculty; it helped me in my\r\nearly experiences as a salesman and blossomed out when I entered my\r\nproper field.\r\n\r\nAnthony Preblesham--for that was his worldly name--did not disappoint my\r\njudgment for he proved one of the most aggressive men I ever hired. The\r\nBrother Paul hocuspocus, which he quickly dropped, had merely caught and\r\ncanalized an abounding energy that would otherwise have flowed aimlessly\r\nin a stagnant world. In Consolidated Pemmican he found his true faith;\r\nhis zeal for our products proved as great if not greater than his former\r\nhysteria for the salvation of mankind. It was no fault of his that the\r\nexpedition he led proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe men Tony Preblesham took with him were all Brother Pauls who--since\r\nthey disdained them--had not been told of material rewards but given the\r\nimpression they were furthering their fanatical creed. They built a camp\r\nupon the Grass, or rather upon the snow which overlay the Grass, near\r\nwhat had once been Springfield, Illinois. Digging down through the snow\r\nto the weed, they discovered it to have lost most of its rubbery\r\nqualities of resistance in dormancy, and cut with comparative ease more\r\nthan four tons which were transported with the greatest difficulty to\r\nthe Florida plant. Here, to anticipate, their work came to nothing, for\r\nno practicable method was found for reducing the grass to a form in\r\nwhich its nutritive elements could be economically extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_61._ The secrecy surrounding the government expedition could not be\r\nmaintained and it was soon learned that what was planned was nothing\r\nless than an attempt to burn great areas of the weed while in its\r\ndormant state. All previous attempts to fire the Grass had been made\r\nwhen the sap was running and it was thought that in its dryer condition\r\nsome measure of success might be obtained. The public instantly\r\ntranslated possibility into probability and probability into virtual\r\ncertainty, their enthusiastic optimism making the winter more bearable.\r\n\r\nThe party proceeded not more than a couple of miles beyond the eastern\r\nedge, dragging with them a flexible pipeline through which was pumped\r\nfueloil, now priceless in the freezing cities. Methodically they sprayed\r\na square mile and set it afire, feeding the flames with the oil. The\r\nburning area sank neatly through the snow, exposing the grass beneath:\r\ndry, yellow and brittle. The stiff, interwoven stolons caught; oil was\r\napplied unstintedly; the crackling and roaring and snapping could be\r\nheard by those well beyond the perimeter of the Grass and the terrific\r\nheat forced the temporary abandonment of the work.\r\n\r\nThe spotbroadcasters in emotional voices gave the news to those whose\r\nradios still functioned. Reporters flashed their editors, BURNING\r\nSUCCESSFUL. WILL STOP GRASS IF MULTIPLIED. All over the country\r\nvolunteer crews were instantly formed to repeat the experiment.\r\n\r\nWhen the flames died down the men crept closer to inspect the results.\r\nThe heat had melted the snow for many yards outside the orbit of fire,\r\nrevealing a border of dull and sodden grass. Beyond this border a\r\nblackened crater had eaten its way straight down to the reclaimed earth\r\nbelow. Shouting and rejoicing greeted this evidence of triumph. What if\r\nthe Grass could advance at will in summer? It could be subdued in winter\r\nand thus kept in check till the ingenuity which devised this one victory\r\ncould win another.\r\n\r\nWorking furiously, the oil was again sprayed, this time over a still\r\nlarger piece and again the flames lit the sky. The President issued a\r\nProclamation of Thanksgiving; the American dollar rose to $175 to the\r\npound, and several prominent expatriates began to think seriously of\r\nreturning home.\r\n\r\nThe second fire burned through the night and aided by a slight change in\r\nthe weather thawed the snow over a great area. Eagerly the expedition,\r\nnow swollen into a small army, returned to continue their triumphant\r\nlabors. The bright sun shone upon the dirtied snow, upon naked muddy\r\nearth in the center of the crater, upon the network of burnt and\r\nblackened stems and upon the wide band of grayishgreen grass the\r\nretreating snow had laid open to its rays. Grayishgreen, but changing in\r\ncolor at every moment as the work of spraying began again.\r\n\r\nChanging color, becoming more verdant, thrusting blades into the air,\r\nmoving its long runners upward and sideways and downward toward the\r\ndestroyed part. Revived by the heat, relieved of the snow, the Grass,\r\nfighting for its life with the same intensity which animated its\r\nattackers, burst into a fury of growth. It covered the evidences of\r\ndestruction in less time than the burning had taken. It tore the\r\npipeline from its tormentors' hands and drove them away with threats of\r\nswift immolation. Defiantly it rose to a pinnacle, hiding its\r\nmutilation, and flaunted its vivid tendrils to bear witness to its\r\ninvulnerability till a killing frost followed by another snowfall\r\ncovered it again.\r\n\r\nSince the delusive hope had been so high, the disappointment threw the\r\npublic into a despair greater than ever before. The nervous tension of\r\nanxiety was replaced by a listlessness of resignation and the suicide\r\nrate, high before, now doubled. For the first time a general admission\r\nwas to be heard that no solution would be found and in another season\r\nthe end would come for the United States. Facing the prospect squarely,\r\nan exodus of the little people, as distinguished from the earlier flight\r\nof men of wealth and foresight, from the country began.\r\n\r\nThis was the first countermeasure attempted since the Grass crossed the\r\nMississippi, and in reaction to its collapse, the return of Brother\r\nPaul's expedition passed almost unnoticed. Only _Time_, now published in\r\nParis, bothered to report it for general circulation: \"Last week from\r\nsome undisclosed spot in mid U.S. returned Mother, 'The Forerunner' Joan\r\n(real name: unknown), and party. Dispatched Grassward by Brother Paul,\r\ndoom-predicting, advent-prophesying graminophile evangelist, the purpose\r\nof Mother Joan's expedition had been her 'Sanctification,' above the\r\nexact spot where the Savior was waiting in the midst of the Grass to\r\nreceive His faithful disciples. Said Brother Paul to reporters after\r\nembracing The Forerunner enthusiastically, 'The expedition has been\r\nsuccessful.' Said Mother Joan, off the record, 'My feet hurt.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_62._ The coming of spring was awaited with grim foreboding, but the\r\nGrass was not bound by any manmade almanac and unable to contain itself\r\ntill the melting of the snow, again leaped the barrier of the\r\nMississippi, this time near Natchez, and ran through the South like\r\nwater from a sloshed dishpan. The prized reforms of the black\r\nlegislatures were wiped out more quickly even than their\r\ngreatgrandfathers' had been in 1877. The wornout cotton and tobacco\r\nlands offered hospitable soil while cypress swamps and winter-swollen\r\ncreeks pumped vitality into the questing runners. Southward and\r\neastward it spread, waiting only the opening of the first pussywillow\r\nand the showing of the first crocus to jump northward and meet the\r\nwestern advance there.\r\n\r\nThe dwindling remnants of cohesion and selfcontrol existing before now\r\ndisappeared completely. The capital was moved to Portland, Maine. Local\r\nlaw and order vanished. The great gangs took over the cities and\r\nextracted what tribute they could from the impoverished inhabitants.\r\nUtilities ceased functioning entirely, what little goods remained were\r\nobtainable only by barter, and epidemic after epidemic decreased the\r\npopulation to fit the shrinking boundaries.\r\n\r\nBrother Paul, deprived of the radio, now multiplied himself infinitely\r\nin the person of his disciples, preaching unremittingly against\r\nresistance, even by thought, to the oncoming Grass. Mother Joan's\r\ninfrequent public appearances attracted enormous crowds as she\r\nproclaimed, \"O be joyful; give your souls to Jesus and your bodies to\r\nthe Grass. I am The Forerunner and after me will come the Ox. Rejoice,\r\nbrothers and sisters, for this is the end of all your suffering and\r\nmisery.\"\r\n\r\nOn foot or rarely with the aid of a horse or mule, the panicstricken\r\npopulation marched northward and eastward. Canadian officials, anxious\r\nto apply immigration controls with the greatest possible latitude, were\r\nthrust aside as though their existence were an irrelevance. Along the\r\nlower reaches of the St Lawrence the refugees came like locusts to\r\ndevour the substance of the _habitants_. Into empty Ungava and almost\r\nequally empty Labrador the hardier ones pushed, armed like their\r\nforebears with only ax and shotgun. Northward and eastward, beyond the\r\nArctic Circle and onto the polar ice they trickled, seeking some place\r\nwhich promised security from the Grass. Passenger rates to Europe or\r\nSouth America, formerly at a premium, now shot to unparalleled heights.\r\n\r\nI wound up my own affairs, disappointed at the failure to find a use for\r\nthe Grass, but still keeping it in view as a future objective, and\r\narranged for the removal of the Florida factory to Brazzaville. Heeding\r\nthe cabled importunities of Stuart Thario I risked my life to travel\r\nonce more into the interior to see Joe and persuade him to come back\r\nwith me. I found them in a small Pennsylvania town in the Alleghenies,\r\nonce a company owned miningvillage. The Grass, advancing rapidly, was\r\njust beyond the nearest mountainridge, replacing the jagged Appalachian\r\nhorizon with a softer and more ominous one.\r\n\r\nThey appeared serene and content, Joe's haggard look of the winter\r\nerased. \"I'm in the middle of the third movement, A W,\" he told me, like\r\na man who had no time to waste on preliminaries or indirections. \"Here.\"\r\nHe thrust an enormous manila envelope at me. \"Here are the first two\r\nmovements. There are no copies and I cannot trust the mails or any other\r\nmessenger to get them out. If possible I'll send the Old Man the third\r\nmovement as soon as it's finished--and the fourth, if I have time. But\r\ntake the first two anyway; at least I'll know theyre preserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joe, Florence!\" I exclaimed. \"This is ridiculous. Insane. Come back\r\nwith me.\"\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n\"You can compose just as well in Europe, if it is so important to you.\r\nIn France, say, or England, away from this danger and discomfort. There\r\nis no doubt the country is finished; come to safety while you can.\"\r\n\r\nFlorence was busy with a stack of musicpaper and offered no comment. Joe\r\nput his hand for a second on my shoulder and then turned away, talking\r\nwith his eyes fixed out the window in the direction of the Grass.\r\n\r\n\"General Herkimer had both legs shot off at the battle of Oriskany. He\r\nmade his men put his back to a treestump and with a flintlock rifle\r\nfired at the enemy until he bled to death. Commodore Lawrence, mortally\r\nwounded, had only one order. Schoolbooks hold the words of John Paul,\r\nselfnamed Jones, and of Hiram Ulysses Grant. Even yesterday, the old\r\ntradition was alive: 'Enemy landing; issue in doubt.' If I finish my\r\nsymphony--\"\r\n\r\n\"When you finish your symphony--\" I encouraged.\r\n\r\n\"If you finish your symphony--\" said Florence quietly.\r\n\r\n\"If I finish my symphony, it must be in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont.\"\r\nHis speech took on a hushed, abstracted tone. \"Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland or Connecticut. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania--\" his voice\r\nrose higher-- \"Maryland, Virginia or West Virginia--\" his shoulders\r\nshook and he seemed to be crying-- \"North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Florida ...\"\r\n\r\nI left them, convinced the madness of the country had found still\r\nanother victim. That night I thankfully boarded the European Clipper for\r\nthe last time. The next day I sank back into civilization as into a\r\ncomfortable bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_63._ \"The United States, July 4 (N.A.N.A.)--'A decent respect for the\r\nopinion of mankind' dictates the content of this summary. Less than two\r\ncenturies past, a small group of smugglers, merchants and planters\r\nunited in an insurrection which in its course gathered to itself such an\r\naccreta of riffraff--debtors, convicts, adventurers, careerists,\r\nforeigners, theoreticians, idealists, revolutionaries, soldiers of\r\nfortune and restless men, that at the height of their numbers they\r\ncomposed, with their sympathizers, perhaps a third of the people in the\r\ncountry. After seven years of inept war in which they had all the\r\nbreaks, including that of a halfhearted enemy, they established 'upon\r\nthis continent a new nation.' Some of the phrases thrown off in the heat\r\nof propaganda were taken seriously and despite shocked opposition\r\nwritten into basic law.\r\n\r\n\"The cryptogram is readable backward or forward, straightaway or upside\r\ndown. Unparalleled resources, the fortuitous historical moment, the tide\r\nof immigration drawing on the best of the world, the implicit good in\r\nconception necessarily resultant in the explicit best of being; high\r\npurpose, inventive genius, exploratory urge, competitive spirit,\r\nfraternal enthusiasm, what does the ascription matter if the end product\r\nwas clear for all to see?\r\n\r\n\"Is it not fitting that a nation calling itself lightly 'God's Country,'\r\nmeaning a land abundantly favored by nature, should find its dispatch\r\nthrough an act of the benefactor become understandably irritable? This\r\nis not to pose the editorial question of justice, but to remember in\r\npassing the girdled forests, abused prairies, gullied lands, the\r\nstupidly harnessed plains, wasted coal, gas, petroleum; the millions of\r\ntons of rich mud denied hungry soil by Mississippi levees and forced\r\nprofitlessly into the salt sea.\r\n\r\n\"A small part, a heartbreakingly small part of the United States remains\r\nat this moment. In a matter of weeks even this little must be overrun,\r\nstilled and covered green as all graves are. Scattered through the world\r\nthere will be Americans, participants in a bitter diaspora. For\r\nthem--and for their children to be instructed zealously in the\r\nformalities of an antique civilization--there can be no Fourth of July,\r\nno Thanksgiving; only one holiday will remain, and that continue through\r\nall the year. Its name, of course, is Memorial Day. W.R.L.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_64._ This was the last dispatch from the once great editor. It was\r\nassumed generally that he had perished with so many others. It was only\r\nsome time later I heard a curious story, for whose authenticity I cannot\r\nvouch.\r\n\r\nTrue to the flippant prediction of Jacson Gootes, Le ffaçasé returned to\r\nthe Church into which he had been born. He went further and became a lay\r\nbrother, taking upon himself the obligation of silence. Though an old\r\nman, he stayed close to the advancing Grass, giving what assistance and\r\ncomfort he could to the refugees. The anecdotes of his sudden appearance\r\nin typhusridden camps, mute and gaunt, hastening with water for the\r\nfeverish, quieting the terrified with a light touch, praying silently\r\nbeside the dying, sound improbable to me, but I mention them for what\r\nthey are worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_65._ When winter came again, the Canadian government petitioned the\r\nParliament at Westminster for crowncolony status and the assent of the\r\nQueen's Privy Council was given to the ending of the premier Dominion.\r\nAll that was left of the largest landmass within the British\r\nCommonwealth was eastern and northern Quebec, the Maritime Provinces and\r\npart of the Northwest Territories.\r\n\r\nThe United States and more than half of Mexico had been wiped from the\r\nmap. From the Pacific to the Atlantic, from Nome to Veracruz stretched a\r\nnew Sargasso Sea of _Cynodon dactylon_. A hundred and eighty million\r\nmen, women, and children had been thrust from their homes by a despised\r\nweed.\r\n\r\nI cannot say life on the other continents--and I could call any of them,\r\nexcept possibly Africa, my home--was undisturbed by the disappearance of\r\nthe United States. American competition gone, the tempo of businesslife\r\nseemed to run slower and slower. Production dwindled, prices rose;\r\nluxury articles were made in abundance, but manufacturers hesitated to\r\nadopt American methods of massproduction for necessities.\r\n\r\nRussia, after her new revolution, was a quiet backwater economically,\r\nalthough politically she caused turmoil by giving a home to the Fourth\r\nInternational. Germany became the leading iron and steel country, but it\r\nwas not an aggressive leadership, rather it was a lackadaisical\r\nacceptance of a fortuitous role; while Britain, often on deathbed but\r\nnever a corpse, without question took the lead in international affairs.\r\n\r\nConsolidated Pemmican and Allied Industries was now, if not the largest,\r\ncertainly one of the largest companies in the world. We purchased sheep\r\nin Australia, beef and wheat and corn in South America, rice and millet\r\nand eggs in Asia, fruit and sugar and milo in Africa, and what the\r\nfarmers of Europe could spare, to process and ship back in palatable,\r\nconcentrated form to a world which now constituted our market. Besides\r\nall this we had of course our auxiliary concerns, many of which\r\ndominated their respective fields. Ministers of finance consulted me\r\nbefore proposing new budgets and there was not a statesman--outside the\r\nSocialist Union--who didnt listen respectfully to my suggestions.\r\n\r\nTony Preblesham had proved an invaluable find. Never the type to whom\r\nauthority in the largest matters could be delegated, nevertheless he was\r\nextremely handy as troubleshooter, exploiter of new territory or\r\nnegotiator with competitors or troublesome laborleaders. The pioneers\r\nwho had fled to the north had little to offer in payment for the vast\r\nquantities of food concentrates they required, but the land was rich in\r\nfurs, timber, and other resources. With permission of the Danish\r\nauthorities I sent Preblesham to Julianthaab. There he established our\r\nheadquarters for Greenland, Iceland, and all that was left of North\r\nAmerica. From Julianthaab immediately radiated a network of posts where\r\nour products were traded for whatever the refugees could bring in.\r\n\r\nBut the Americans who had gone into the icy wastes were not seeking\r\nsubsistence. They were striving mightily to reach some place of\r\nsanctuary where they could no longer be menaced by the Grass. Beyond the\r\nArctic Circle? Here they might learn to imitate the Innuit, living on\r\nfish and seals and an occasional obligingly beached whale. But could\r\nthey be sure, on territory contiguous or very nearly contiguous to that\r\nsupporting the weed, that they could count on immunity? They did not\r\nbelieve so. They filled up Newfoundland in the hope that the narrow Gulf\r\nof St Lawrence and the narrower Straits of Belle Isle might offer\r\nprotective barriers. They crossed on sleds to Baffin Island and in\r\nhomemade boats to Greenland. Before the Grass had wiped out their\r\nfamilies, and their less hardy compatriots left behind in Nova Scotia\r\nand Prince Edward Island, these pioneers abandoned the continent of\r\ntheir origin; the only effect of their passage having been to\r\nexterminate the last of the Innuit by the propagation of the manifold\r\ndiseases they had brought with them.\r\n\r\nIn the south the tempo was slower, the striving for escape less\r\nhysterical and more philosophic. When the Mexican peon heard the Grass\r\nwas in the next village he packed his few belongings and moved farther\r\naway. From Tampico to Chiapas the nation journeyed easily south, not\r\nregretting too loudly the lands left behind, not crowding or jostling\r\nrudely on the highways, not failing to pause for siestas when the sun\r\nwas hot, but traveling steadily in a quiet resignation that seemed\r\nbeyond resignation--the extension of a gracious will.\r\n\r\n\r\n_66._ But the rest of the world, even in the lethargy which had come\r\nupon it in viewing the loss of most of North America, could not afford\r\nto leave the Grass to its own devices, content to receive the refugees\r\nit drove out or watch them die. A World Congress to Combat the Grass was\r\nhastily called in London. It was a distinguished body of representatives\r\nfrom all the nations and resembled at its best the now functionless\r\nFederal Disruptions Committee.\r\n\r\nAt the opening sitting a delegation with credentials from the President\r\nof the United States attempted to join in the proceedings. One of the\r\nFrench members rose to inquire of the chairman, Where was the United\r\nStates? He, the delegate, had read of such a country, had heard it\r\nspoken of--and none too favorably--but did it exist, _de facto_?\r\n\r\nThe delegate from Haiti asked for the floor and wished to assure his\r\ndistinguished colleague from the motherland of culture--especially did\r\nhe wish to assure this learned gentleman, bound as they were by the same\r\nbeautiful and meticulous language--that his country had good reason to\r\nknow the United States actually existed--or had done so at one time. His\r\nglorious land bore scars inflicted by the barbarians. His own\r\ngrandfather, a great patriot, had been hunted down by the United States\r\nMarines as a bandit. He implored a congress with humanitarian designs to\r\nrefuse admission to the delegates of the socalled United States.\r\n\r\nOne of the German delegates, after wiping the perspiration from the\r\nthree folds on the back of his neck, said he spoke with great diffidence\r\nfor fear of being misunderstood. The formerly existent country had twice\r\ndefeated, or apparently defeated, his own in a war and his distinguished\r\ncolleagues might misinterpret the spirit which moved him. Nevertheless,\r\nhe could not refrain from remarking that it appeared to him that a Just\r\nProvidence had wiped out the United States and therefore it would be\r\nillogical if not blasphemous for this august body to admit a delegation\r\nfrom a nonexistent country.\r\n\r\nThe American delegation attempted to point out feebly that Hawaii still\r\nremained and Puerto Rico and Guam. The members from the various sections\r\nof the British Commonwealth, arguing the precedents of the\r\ngovernmentsinexile, urged the acceptance of their credentials. The\r\nrepresentative of Switzerland called for a vote and the credentials were\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nThis controversy being settled, the body, in high good humor, selected a\r\ngoverning committee to take whatever measures it deemed necessary to\r\nprotect the rest of the world from the menace. After lengthy debate and\r\nmuch conflicting testimony from experts a bold plan was endorsed. It was\r\ndecided to complete the digging of the Nicaragua Canal and blow up that\r\npart of Central America lying between it and the Isthmus of Panama. It\r\nwas a colossal feat of engineering which would cost billions of pounds\r\nand untold manpower, but the nations of the world, not without some\r\ngrumbling, finally agreed to the expenditure.\r\n\r\nWhile technicians from all over the world directed laborgangs and\r\nsteamshovels, ammunitionships loaded with tons of explosives sailed from\r\nevery port for Panama and Colon. Though at first reluctant with their\r\ncontributions, the countries had reconsidered and poured forth their\r\nshares without stint. All obsolete warmaterials were shipped to the\r\nscene of action. Prisons were emptied to supply the needed manpower and\r\nwhen this measure fell short all without visible means of support were\r\nadded to the roll.\r\n\r\nShortsightedly Costa Rica protested vigorously the proposed destruction\r\nof its entire territory and there were even momentary uprisings of\r\npatriots who proposed to defend their nation with the last drop of\r\nblood, but commonsense and international amity prevailed, especially\r\nwhen Costa Ricans were promised a territory twice as big as their native\r\ncountry in the hinterland between Colombia and Venezuela, a valueless\r\ntract both nations had been trying in vain to settle for decades.\r\n\r\nNight and day the detonations of highexplosives killed fish on both the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific sides of Central America and brought stunned birds\r\nplummeting down from the skies to their death. The coastal plains fell\r\ninto the sea, great mountains were reduced to powder and little by\r\nlittle the gap between North and South America widened.\r\n\r\nBut the progress of the work was infinitesimal compared with the advance\r\nof the Grass. It swept over the ancient Aztec empire down to the Isthmus\r\nof Tehuantepec. The ruins of Mayan civilization, excavated once, were\r\nburied anew. The demolition engineers measured their daily progress in\r\nfeet, the Grass in miles. When the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nmet in Lake Nicaragua, the Grass was in Yucatan. When the first green\r\nrunners invaded Guatemala, a bare twenty miles of northern Panama had\r\nbeen demolished and hardly a start had been made in the destruction of\r\nCosta Rica.\r\n\r\nFleets of airplanes bombed the connecting strip in the area left by\r\nengineers to the last, but as their flights went on the Grass crept into\r\nBritish Honduras. The workers sent another twenty miles of Panama into\r\nnothingness and the Grass completed the conquest of Guatemala. They blew\r\nup another ten miles and the Grass took over El Salvador. Dynamite\r\nwidened the Nicaragua Canal to a ridiculously thin barrier as the Grass\r\noverran Honduras.\r\n\r\nThey stood now almost facetoface, the width of one pitiful little Banana\r\nRepublic between them. On one hand the Grass, funneled and constricted\r\nto a strip of land absurdly inadequate to support its gargantuan might,\r\non the other the combined resources of man, desperately determined to\r\ndestroy the bridge before the invader. In tropic heat the work was kept\r\nup at superhuman pace. Gangs of native laborers fainting under their\r\nloads were blown skyhigh by impatient technicians unwilling to waste the\r\ntime necessary to revive them. In selfdefense the South American states\r\ndoubled their contributions. At the edge of the weed all the offensive\r\nweapons of the world were massed to stay it as long as possible, for\r\neven a day's--even an hour's delay might be invaluable.\r\n\r\nBut the Grass overbore the heavy artillery, the flamethrowers, the\r\nbombs, the radium, and all the devices in its path. The inventions of\r\nwar whose constant improvement was the pride of the human race offered\r\nno more obstacle to the Grass than a few anthills might to a herd of\r\nstampeding elephants. It swept down to the edge of the ditch and paused\r\nat the fiftymile stretch of saltwater between it and the shapeless\r\nisland still offering the temptation of a foothold in front of the now\r\nvastly enlarged Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nIf those engaged in the task, from coordinator-in-chief down to the\r\nsweating waterboys, had worked like madmen before, they worked like\r\ntriple madmen now, for the wind might blow a single seed onto what had\r\nbeen Costa Rica and undo all they had so far accomplished. The\r\nexplosions were continuous, rocking the diminishing territory with\r\nceaseless earthquakes. After an hour on the job men reeled away,\r\ndeafened, blinded and shocked.\r\n\r\nOn the South American side, as had been planned, great supercyclone fans\r\nwere set up to blow back any errant seed. Fed by vast hydroelectric\r\nplants in the Colombian highlands, the noise of their revolving blades\r\ndrowned out the sounds of the explosions for all those nearby. The\r\noceans became interested participants and enormously high tides possibly\r\ncaused by the difference in level between the Atlantic and Pacific,\r\nclawed away great hunks of land. The great island became a small island,\r\nthe small island an islet. At last nothing but ruffling blue water lay\r\nbetween the Grass and South America. Over this stretch of sea the great\r\nfans blew their steady breath, protecting the continent behind from the\r\nfate of its northern twin.\r\n\r\nThe passage between was forbidden to all ships for fear they might\r\ninadvertently act as carriers of the seed. The lost continent was not\r\nonly isolated, it was sealed off. From the sharp apex of the inverted\r\ntriangle to its broad base in the arctic ice the Grass flourished in one\r\nundisputed prairie, the sole legatee of all the hopes, trials,\r\nafflictions, dreams and victories of the men and women who had lived\r\nthere since the first alien foot was set upon its soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE\r\n\r\n_The South Pacific Sailing Directory_\r\n\r\n\r\n_67._ I cannot say the world greeted the end of the North American\r\ncontinent with either rejoicing or regret. Relief, yes. When the news of\r\nthe last demolition was given and it was clear the Grass was unable to\r\nbridge the gap, the imaginative could almost hear mankind emit a vast\r\nsigh. The world was saved, they could go about their business now,\r\nhaving written off a sixth of themselves.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of Miss Francis' remark that if you cut off a man's leg\r\nyou bestow upon him a crippled mentality. For approximately two\r\ncenturies the United States had been a leg of the global body, a limb so\r\nconstantly inflicted with growingpains it caused the other parts to\r\nwrithe in sympathy. Now the member was cut off and everyone thought that\r\nwith the troublesome appendage gone life would be pleasanter and\r\nsimpler. Debtor nations expanded their chests when they remembered Uncle\r\nShylock was no more. Industrial countries looked eagerly to enlarge\r\ntheir markets in those places where Americans formerly sold goods. Small\r\nstates whose inhabitants were occasionally addicted to carrying off\r\ntourists and holding them for ransom now felt they could dispense with\r\nthose foreign undersecretaries whose sole business it had been to write\r\ndiplomatic notes of apology.\r\n\r\nBut it was a crippled world and the lost leg still twitched spectrally.\r\nI don't think I speak now as a native of the United States, for with my\r\ninternational interests I believe I have become completely a\r\ncosmopolitan, but for everyone, Englishman, Italian, Afrikander or\r\ncitizen of Liberia. The disappearance of America created a revolution in\r\ntheir lives, a change perhaps not immediately apparent, but eventually\r\nto be recognized by all.\r\n\r\nIt was the trivial things we Americans had taken for granted as part of\r\nour daily lives and taught the rest of the world to appreciate which\r\nwere most quickly missed. The substitution of English, Turkish, Egyptian\r\nor Russian cigarettes for good old Camels or Luckies; the impossibility\r\nof buying a bottle of cocacola at any price; the disappearance of the\r\nsolacing wad of chewinggum; the pulsing downbeat of a hot band--these\r\nwere the first things whose loss was noticed.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I had been too busy to attend movingpictures, except\r\nrarely, but a man--especially a man with much on his mind--needs\r\nrelaxation and I would not choose the foreign movies with their morbid\r\nemphasis on problems and crime and sex in preference to the cleancut\r\nAmerican product which always satisfied the nobler feelings by showing\r\nthe reward of the honest, the downfall of evildoers and the purity of\r\nlove and motherhood. Art is all very well, but need it be sordid?\r\n\r\nAs I told George Thario, I am no philistine; I think the Parthenon and\r\nthe Taj Mahal are lovely buildings, but I would not care to have an\r\noffice in either of them--give me Radio City. I don't mind the highbrow\r\nprograms the British Broadcasting Corporation put on; I myself am quite\r\ncapable of understanding and enjoying them, but I imagine there are\r\nthousands of housewives who would prefer a good serial to bring romance\r\ninto their lives. I don't object to a commercial world in which\r\ncompetitors go through the formality of pretending to be scrupulously\r\nfair in talking about each others' products, but I must admit I missed\r\nthe good old American slapdash advertising which yelled, Buy my\r\ndeodorant or youll stink; wash your mouth with my antiseptic or youll\r\nlose your job; brush your teeth with my dentifrice or no one will kiss\r\nyou; powder your face with my leadarsenate or youll keep your\r\nmaidenhead. I would give a lot of money to hear a singing commercial\r\nonce more or watch the neon lights north of Times Square urge me to buy\r\nsomething for which I have no possible use. Living within your income is\r\nfine, but the world lacks the goods youd have bought on the\r\ninstallmentplan; getting what you need is sound policy, but how many\r\nlives were lightened by the young men working their way through college,\r\nor the fullerbrushman?\r\n\r\nI think there was a subconscious realization of this which came\r\ngradually to the top. In the beginning the almost universal opinion was\r\nthat the loss of the aching limb was for the better. I have heard\r\nsocalled cultured foreigners discuss the matter in my presence,\r\ndoubtless unaware I was an American. No more tourists, they gloated, to\r\nstand with their backs to the Temple of Heaven in Pekin and explain the\r\nsuperior construction of the Masonic Hall at Cedar Rapids; no more\r\nvisitors to the champagne caves at Rheims to inquire where they could\r\nget a shot of real bourbon; no more music lovers at Salzburg or\r\nGlyndebourne to regret audibly the lack of a peppy swingtune; no more\r\ngourmets in Vienna demanding thick steaks, rare and smothered in onions.\r\n\r\nBut this period of smug selfcongratulation was soon succeeded by a\r\nstrange nostalgia which took the form of romanticizing the lost land.\r\nAmerican books were reprinted in vast quantities in the Englishspeaking\r\nnations and translated anew in other countries. American movies were\r\nrevived and imitated. Fashionable speech was powdered with what were\r\nconceived to be Yankee expressions and a southern drawl was assiduously\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\nBestselling historical novels were laid in the United States and popular\r\noperas were written about Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, and Kit Carson.\r\nMen told their growing sons to work hard, for now there was left no land\r\nof opportunity to which they could emigrate, no country where they could\r\nbecome rich overnight with little effort. Instead of fairytales children\r\ndemanded stories of fortyniners and the Wedding of the Rails; and on the\r\nstreets of Bombay and Cairo urchins, probably quite unaware of the\r\nmemorial gesture, could be heard whistling _Casey Jones_.\r\n\r\nBut handinhand with this newfound romantic love went a completely\r\npractical attitude toward those Americans still existing in the flesh.\r\nThe earliest expatriates, being generally men of substance, were well\r\nreceived. The thousands who had crossed by small boats from Canada to\r\nGreenland and from Greenland to Iceland to Europe were by definition in\r\na different category and found the quota system their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers had devised used to deny their own entrance.\r\n\r\nThey were as bewildered and hurt as children that any nation could be at\r\nonce so shortsighted and so heartless as to bar homeless wanderers. We\r\nbring you knowledge and skills and our own need, they said in effect, we\r\nwill be an asset to your country if you admit us. The Americans could\r\nnot understand; they themselves had been fair to all and only kept out\r\nundesirable immigrants.\r\n\r\nGradually the world geared itself to a slower tempo. The gogetter\r\nfollowed the brontosaurus to extinction, and we Americans with the\r\nforesight to carry on our businesses from new bases profited by the\r\nunAmerican backwardness of our competitors. At this time I daresay I was\r\namong the hundred most important figures of the world. In the marketing\r\nand packaging of our original products I had been forced to acquire\r\npapermills and large interests in aluminum and steel; from there the\r\nprogression to tinmines and rollingmills, to coalfields and railroads,\r\nto shippinglines and machineshops was not far. Consolidated Pemmican,\r\nonce the center of my business existence, was now but a minor point on\r\nits periphery. I expanded horizontally and vertically, delighted to show\r\nmy competitors that Americans, even when deprived of America, were not\r\nrobbed of the traditional American enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n_68._ It was at this time, many months after we had given up all hope of\r\nhearing from Joe again, that General Thario received a longdelayed\r\npackage from his son. It contained the third movement of the symphony\r\nand a covering letter:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Father--Stuart Thario--General-- I shall not finish this letter\r\ntonight; it will be sent with as much of the First Symphony as makes a\r\nworthy essence when it goes. The whole is greater than the sum of its\r\nparts, but there is a place (perhaps not in life, but somewhere) for the\r\nimperfect, for the incomplete. The great and small alike achieve\r\nfulfillment, satisfaction--must this be a ruthless denial of all\r\nbetween?\r\n\r\n\"I have always despised musicologists, makers of programnotes, little\r\nmen who tell you the opening chords of Opus 67 describe Fate Knocking at\r\nthe Door or the call of the yellowhammer. A child draws a picture and\r\nwrites on it, 'This is a donkey,' and when grown proves it to be a\r\nselfportrait by translating the Jupiter Symphony into words. Having said\r\nthis, let me stultify myself--but for private ears alone--as a bit of\r\npersonal history, not an explanation to be appended to the score.\r\n\r\n\"I started out to express in terms of strings and winds the emotions\r\nroused in me by the sight and thoughts of the Grass, much as LvB took a\r\nmistaken idealization of his youth as a startingpoint for Opus 55; but\r\njust as no man is an island, so no theme stands alone. There is a cord\r\nbinding the lesser to the greater; a mystic union between all things.\r\nThe Grass is not an entity, but an aspect. I thought I was writing about\r\nmy country, conceived of myself in a reversed snobbishness, a haughty\r\nhumility, a proud abasement, as a sort of superior Smetana. (Did you\r\nknow that as a boy I dreamed of the day when I should receive my\r\ncommission as second lieutenant?)\r\n\r\n                                                 Boston, Massachusetts\r\n\r\n\"I interrupted this letter to sketch some of the middle section of the\r\nfourth movement and I have wasted a precious week following a false\r\ntrail. And of course the thought persists that it may not have been a\r\nfalse trail at all, but the right one; the business of saying something\r\nis a perpetual wrestle with doubts.\r\n\r\n\"We leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination--Portsmouth probably\r\nand then somewhere in Maine, hoping to wrench from fate the time to\r\nfinish the score. It seems more than a little pompous to continue my\r\nexplanation. The Grass, the United States, humanity, God--whatever we\r\nwrite about we write about the same things.\r\n\r\n\"Still there is a limit to individual perception and it seems to me my\r\nconcern--at least my musical concern--is enclosed by Canada and Mexico,\r\nthe Pacific and Atlantic. So, rightly or wrongly, even if the miracle\r\noccur and I do finish in time, I cannot leave. A short distance, such a\r\nshort distance from where I scribble these words, Vanzetti died. No more\r\nchildish thought than atonement was ever conceived. It is a base and\r\nbaseless gratification. Evil is not recalled. So I do not sentence\r\nmyself for the murder of Vanzetti or for my manifold crimes; who am I to\r\npass judgment, even on me? But all of us, accusers and accused,\r\ncondemners and condemned, will remain--forever indistinguishable. If the\r\nrequiem for our faults and our virtues, if the celebration of our past\r\nand the prayer for our resurrection can be orchestrated, then the fourth\r\nmovement will be finished. If not--\r\n\r\n                                                      Aroostook, Maine\r\n\r\n\"By the best calculations we have about three more days. I do not think\r\nthe symphony can be finished, but the thought no longer disturbs me. It\r\nwould be a good thing to complete it, just as it would be a good thing\r\nto sit on fleecy clouds and enjoy eternal, nevermelting, nevercloying\r\nicecreamcones, celestially flavored.\r\n\r\n\"The man who is to carry this letter waits impatiently. I must finish\r\nquickly before his conviction of my insanity outweighs the promises I\r\nhave made of reward from you and causes him to run from me. My love to\r\nMama, the siblings and yourself and kindly regards to the great magnate.\r\n\r\n                                                                  Joe\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_69._ About the same time I also received a letter which somehow got\r\nthrough the protective screening of my secretaries:\r\n\r\n    \"Albert Weener,\r\n    Savoy Hotel,\r\n    Thames Embankment, WC1.\r\n\r\n    \"Sir:\r\n    You may recall making an offer I considered premature. It is now no\r\n    longer so. I am at home afternoons from 1 until 6 at 14, Little Bow\r\n    Street, EC3 (3rd floor, rear).\r\n                                            Josephine Spencer Francis\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of her rudeness at our last meeting, my good nature caused me\r\nto send a cab for her. She wore the identical gray suit of years before\r\nand her face was still unlined and dubiously clean.\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, Miss Francis? I'm glad to find you among the lucky ones.\r\nNowadays if we don't hear from old friends we automatically assume their\r\nloss.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at me as one scans an acquaintance whose name has been\r\nembarrassingly forgotten. \"There is no profit for you in this\r\npoliteness, Weener,\" she said abruptly. \"I am here to beg a favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything I can do for you, Miss Francis, will be a pleasure,\" I assured\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe began using a toothpick, but it was not the oldfashioned gold\r\none--just an ordinary wooden splinter. \"Hum. You remember asking me to\r\nsuperintend gathering specimens of _Cynodon dactylon_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances have greatly altered since then,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"They have a habit of doing so. I merely mentioned your offer because\r\nyou coupled it with a chance to advance my own research as an\r\ninducement. I am on the way to develop the counteragent, but to advance\r\nfurther I need to make tests upon the living grass itself. The World\r\nControl Congress has refused me permission to use specimens. I have no\r\nprivate means of evading their fiat.\"\r\n\r\n\"An excellent thing. The decrees of the congress are issued for the\r\nprotection of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hypocrisy as well as unctuousness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a hundred hireling chemists, all of them with a string of\r\ndegrees, at your service. I want to borrow two of them and be landed on\r\nsome American mountain, above the snowline, where I can continue to\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides being illegal--to mention such a thing is apparently\r\nhypocritical--such a hazardous and absurd venture is hardly in the\r\nnature of a business proposition, Miss Francis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Philanthropic, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given fifty thousand pounds to set up nurseryschools right here\r\nin London--\"\r\n\r\n\"So the mothers of the little brats will be free to work in your\r\nfactories.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have donated ten thousand pounds to Indian famine relief--\"\r\n\r\n\"So that you might cut the wages of your Hindu workers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have subscribed five thousand pounds for sanitation in Szechwan--\"\r\n\r\n\"Thereby lessening absenteeism from sickness among your coolies.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not stoop to answer your insinuations,\" I said. \"I merely\r\nmentioned my gifts to show that my charities are on a worldwide scale\r\nand there is little room in them for the relief of individuals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I come to you for a personal sinecure? I don't ask if you\r\nhave no concern outside selfish interest, for the answer is immediate\r\nand obvious; but isnt it to that same selfish interest to protect what\r\nremains of the world? If the other continents go as North America has\r\ngone, will you alone be divinely translated to some extraterrestrial\r\nsphere? And if so, will you take your wealth and power with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am supporting three laboratories devoted exclusively to\r\nantigraminous research and anyway the rest of the world is amply\r\nprotected by the oceans.\"\r\n\r\nShe removed the toothpick in order to laugh unpleasantly. \"Once a\r\nsalesman always a salesman, Weener. Lie to yourself, deny facts, brazen\r\nit out. The world was safe behind the saltband too, in the days when\r\nJosephine Francis was a quack and charlatan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Admitting your great attainments, Miss Francis, the fact remains that\r\nyou are a woman and the adventure you propose is hardly one for a lady\r\nto undertake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weener, you are ineffable. I'm not a lady--I'm a chemist.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation deadlocked as I waited for her to go. Oddly enough, in\r\nspite of her sex and the illegality of her proposal, I was inclined to\r\nhelp her, if she had approached me in a reasonable manner and not with\r\nthe uncouth bearing of a superior toward an inferior. If she _could_\r\nfind a counteragent, I thought ... if she could find a weapon, then the\r\npossibility of utilizing the Grass as a raw material for food\r\nconcentrates, a design still tantalizingly just beyond the reach of our\r\nresearchworkers, might be realized. Labor costs would be cut to a\r\nminimum....\r\n\r\nI could not let the woman be her own worst enemy; I was big enough to\r\noverlook her unfortunate attitudes and see through the cranky exterior\r\nto the worthy idealist and true woman beneath. I was interrupted in my\r\nthoughts by Miss Francis speaking again.\r\n\r\n\"North American landtitles have no value right now, but a man with money\r\nwho knew ahead of time the Grass could be destroyed ...\"\r\n\r\nHow clumsy, I thought, trying to appeal to a cupidity I don't possess;\r\nas if I would cheat people by buying up their very homes for sordid\r\nspeculation. \"Miss Francis,\" I said, \"purely out of generosity and in\r\nremembrance of old times I am inclined to consider helping you. I\r\nsuppose you have the details of the equipment you will need, the\r\nqualifications of your assistants, and a rough idea of what mountain you\r\nmight prefer as a location?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" and she began rattling off a catalogue of items, stabbing\r\nthe air with her toothpick as a sort of running punctuation.\r\n\r\nI stopped her with a raised hand. \"Please. Reduce your list to writing\r\nand leave it with my secretary. I will see what can be done.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had gone I picked up the phone and cabled Tony Preblesham\r\nto report to me immediately. The decision to send him with Miss Francis\r\nhad been instantaneous, but had I thought about it for hours no happier\r\ndesign could have been conceived. Outside of General Thario there was\r\nnot another man in my organization I could trust so implicitly. The\r\nexpedition required double, no, triple secrecy and Preblesham could not\r\nonly guard against any ulterior and selfish aims Miss Francis might\r\nentertain--to say nothing of the erratic or purely feminine impulses\r\nwhich could possibly operate to the disadvantage of all concerned--but\r\ntake the opportunity to give the continent a general survey, both to\r\nkeep in view the utilization of the weed, whether or not it could be\r\nconquered; and whatever possibilities a lay observer might see as to the\r\nGrass perishing of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_70._\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Albert Weener,\r\n      Queen Elizabeth Hotel,\r\n        Perth, Western Australia, A.C.\r\n\r\n    \"Dear Sir:--\r\n    According to yr. instructions our party left Paramaribo on the 9th\r\n    inst. for Medellin, giving out that we were going to see possible\r\n    tin deposits near there. At Medellin I checked with our men & was\r\n    told that work gangs with the stuff needed to make landing fields\r\n    together with caches of gas & oil, enough for 3 times the flying\r\n    required had been dropped both at Mt. Whitney & on Banks Island. A.\r\n    W., I tell you the boys down there are on their toes. Of course I\r\n    did not tell them this, but gave them a real old fashioned Pep Talk,\r\n    & told them if they really made good they might be moved up to Rio\r\n    or Copenhagen or may be even London.\r\n\r\n    \"Every thing being O.K. in Medellin, we left on the 12th inst.,\r\n    heading at first South to fool any nosey cops & then straight West\r\n    so as to be out of range of the patrol boats. It was quite late\r\n    before we could head North and the navigator was flying by\r\n    instruments so it was not until dawn that we saw land. You can sneer\r\n    all you like at Bro. Paul (& of course he has not had the benefits\r\n    of an Education like you, A. W.) but I want to tell you that when I\r\n    looked out of the port & saw nothing but green grass where houses &\r\n    trees & mtns. ought to have been, I remembered that I was a\r\n    backslider & sinful man. However, this is beside the point.\r\n\r\n    \"The lady professor, Miss Francis I mean, & Mr. White & Mr. Black\r\n    were both so excited they could hardly eat, but kept making funny\r\n    remarks in some foreign language which I do not understand. However\r\n    I do not think there was any thing wrong or disloyal to you in their\r\n    conversation.\r\n\r\n    \"You would have thought that flying over so much green would have\r\n    got tiresome after some time, but you would have been wrong. I am\r\n    sorry I cannot describe it to you, but I can only say again that it\r\n    made me think of my Account with my Maker.\r\n\r\n    \"While I think of it, altho it does not belong here, in Paramaribo I\r\n    had to fire our local man as he had got into trouble with the Police\r\n    there & was giving Cons. Pem. a bad name. He said it was on the\r\n    Firm's account, but I told him you did not approve of breaking the\r\n    Law at all.\r\n\r\n    \"We had no trouble sighting the party at Mt. Whitney & I want to\r\n    tell you, A. W., it was a great relief to get rid of the Scientists\r\n    altho they are no doubt all right in their way. Some of the work\r\n    gang kicked at being left behind altho that was in our agreement.\r\n    They said they were sick of the snow & the sight of the Grass\r\n    beyond. I said we only had room in the transport for the Banks Is.\r\n    gang & anyway they would have company now. I promised them we would\r\n    pick them up on our next trip.\r\n\r\n    \"Miss Francis & the 2 others acted like crazy. They kept shaking\r\n    each other's hands & saying We are here, we are here, altho any body\r\n    but a Nut would have thought saying it was a waste of time as even a\r\n    small child could have seen that they were. And any way, why any\r\n    body should want to be there is some thing beyond me.\r\n\r\n    \"We took off from Whitney on the 14th inst., flying back S. West.\r\n    There were no land marks, but the navigator told me when we were\r\n    over the Site of L. A. I have to report that the Grass looked no\r\n    different in this Area, where it is the oldest. Then we flew North\r\n    E., looking for the Gt. Salt Lake according to yr. instructions. I\r\n    am sorry to say that we could not find it altho we flew back & forth\r\n    for some time, searching while the instruments were checked. The\r\n    Lake has disappeared in the Grass.\r\n\r\n    \"We headed North E. by E., finding no land marks except a few peaks\r\n    above the snow on the Rocky Mtns. I am very glad to say that the Gt.\r\n    Lakes are still there, altho much smaller & L. Erie & L. Ontario so\r\n    shrunk I might have missed them if the pilot had not pointed them\r\n    out. The St. Lawrence River is of course gone.\r\n\r\n    \"We followed the line of the big Canadian Lakes N., but except for\r\n    Depressions (which may be Swamps) in the latitudes of the Gt. Bear &\r\n    Gt. Slave Lakes, there is nothing but Grass. We stayed over night at\r\n    Banks Is. & it was very cold & miserable, but we were happy to\r\n    remember that there was no Grass underneath the Snow below us. Next\r\n    morning (the 16th) after fueling up we took off (with the ground\r\n    crew) for the Homeward trip.\r\n\r\n    \"Stopping at Whitney, every thing was O.K. except that I did not see\r\n    the lady professor (Miss Francis, I mean) as Mr. White and Mr. Black\r\n    said she was too busy.\r\n\r\n    \"I will be in London to meet you on the 1st as arranged & give you\r\n    any further news you want. Until then, I remain,\r\n        Yrs. Truly,\r\n            A. Preblesham, Vice-Pres. in Chge of Field Operations,\r\n                                                           Cons. Pem.\"\r\n\r\nI cannot say Preblesham's report was particularly enlightening, but it\r\nat least squelched any notion the Grass might be dying of itself. I did\r\nnot expect any great results from the scientists' expedition, but I felt\r\nit worth a gamble. In the meantime I dismissed the lost continent from\r\nmy mind and turned to more immediate concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_71._ The disappearance of American foundries and the withdrawal of the\r\nRussian products from export after their second revolution had forced a\r\nboom in European steel. English, French, and German manufacturers of\r\nautomobiles, rails, and locomotives, anticipating tremendously enlarged\r\noutlets for their output--even if those new markets still fell short of\r\nthe demand formerly drawing upon the American factories--had earmarked\r\nthe entire world supply for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nSince I owned large blocks of stock, not only in the industries, but in\r\nthe rollingmills as well, this boom was profitable to me. I had long\r\nsince passed the point where it was necessary, no matter how great my\r\nexpenses or philanthropies, for me to exert myself further; but as I\r\nhave always felt anyone who gains wealth without effort is no better\r\nthan a parasite, I was contracting for new plants in Bohemia, Poland,\r\nNorthern Italy and France. I did not neglect buying heavily into the\r\nBriey Basin and into the Swedish oremines to ensure the future supply of\r\nthese mills. In spite of the able assistance of Stuart Thario and the\r\nexcellent spadework of Preblesham, I was so busy at this time--for in\r\naddition to everything else the sale of concentrates diagrammed an\r\neverascending spiral--that food and sleep seemed to be only irritating\r\ncurtailments of the workingday.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion when I was a youth for novelists to sneer at\r\nbusinessmen and proclaim that the conduct of industry was a simple\r\naffair, such as any halfwit could attend to with but a portion of his\r\nmind. I wish these cynics could have come to know the delicate workings\r\nand balances of my intricate empire. We in responsible positions, and\r\nmyself most of all, were on a constant alert, ready for instant decision\r\nor personal attention to a mass of new detail at any moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_72._ On one of the occasions when I had to fly to Copenhagen it was\r\nWinifred and not General Thario who met me at the airport. \"General T is\r\nso upset,\" she explained in her vivacious way, \"that I had to come\r\ninstead. But perhaps I should have sent Pauline?\"\r\n\r\nI assured her I was pleased to see her and hastened to express concern\r\nfor her father.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not him at all, really,\" she said. \"It's Mama. She's all\r\nbothered about Joe.\"\r\n\r\nI lowered my voice respectfully and said I was sure Mrs Thario was\r\novercome with grief and perhaps I had better not intrude at such a time.\r\n\r\n\"Poo!\" dissented Winifred. \"Mama doesnt know what grief is. She's simply\r\ndelighted at Joe's doing a Custer, but she's awfully bothered about his\r\nmusic.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" I asked. \"Do you mean getting it performed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Getting it performed, nothing. Getting it suppressed. That a long line\r\nof generals and admirals should wind up in a composer is to her a\r\ndisgrace which will need a great deal of living down. It preys on her\r\nmind. Poor old Stuart is home now reading her choice passages from the\r\n_Winning of the West_ by Theodore Roosevelt to soothe her nerves.\"\r\n\r\nI had been more than a little apprehensive of meeting Mama again, but\r\nWinifred's report seemed to reassure me that she would be confined, if\r\nnot to bed, at least to her own apartments. I was sadly disillusioned to\r\nfind her ensconced in a comfortable armchair beside a brightly burning\r\nfire, the general with a book held open by his thumb. He greeted me with\r\nhis usual affection. \"Albert, I'm sorry I wasnt able to get to the\r\nairport.\"\r\n\r\nI shook his hand and turned to his wife. \"I regret to hear you are\r\nindisposed, Mrs Thario.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare me your damned crocodile tears. Where is my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"In his last letter he suggested he would remain in our country as long\r\nas it existed; however it is possible--even probable he escaped. Let us\r\nhope so, Mrs Thario.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the sort of damned hogwash you feed to green troops, not to\r\nveterans. My son is dead. In action. My grandfather went the same way at\r\nChancellorsville. Do you think me some whimpering broompusher to weep at\r\nthe loss of a son on the battlefield?\"\r\n\r\nStuart Thario put his hand on her arm. \"Easy ... bloodpressure ... no\r\nexcitement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in regimentals,\" said Mama, and relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nWe had a very uneasy dinner, during which we were unable to discuss\r\nbusiness owing to the presence of the ladies. Afterward the general and\r\nI withdrew with our coffee--he did not drink at home, so I missed the\r\nclarity which always accompanied his indulgence--and were deep in\r\nfigures and calculations when Winifred summoned us hastily.\r\n\r\n\"General, Mr Weener, come quickly! Mama ...\"\r\n\r\nWe hurried into the living room, I for one anticipating Mama if not in\r\nthe throes of a stroke at least in a faint. But she was standing upright\r\nbefore the open fire, an unsheathed cavalry saber in her hand. It was\r\nclearly a family relic, for from its guard dangled the golden tassel of\r\nthe United States Army and on its naked blade were little spots of rust,\r\nbut it looked dangerous enough as she warned us off with a sweep of it.\r\nIn her other hand I recognized the bulky manuscript of George Thario's\r\nFirst Symphony which she was burning, page by page.\r\n\r\n\"Some damned impostor,\" she said. \"Some damned impostor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harriet,\" protested the general, \"Harriet, please ... the boy's work\r\n... only copy ...\"\r\n\r\nShe fed another leaf to the fire. \"... impostor ...\"\r\n\r\n\"Harriet--\" he advanced toward her, but she waved him away with the\r\nsharp blade--\"can't burn George's work this way ... gave his life ...\"\r\n\r\nI had not thought highly of Joe's talents as a musician, believing them\r\nbyandlarge to be but reflections of his unfortunate affectations. I\r\nthink I can say I appreciate good music and Ive often taken a great deal\r\nof pleasure from hearing a hotelband play Rubinstein's Melody in F, or\r\nlike classical numbers, during mealtimes. But even if Joe's symphony was\r\nbut a series of harsh and disjointed sounds, I thought its destruction a\r\ndreadful thing for Mama to do and the more shocking, aside from any\r\nquestion of artistic taste, because of its reversal of all we associate\r\nwith the attitude of true motherhood.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs Thario,\" I protested, \"as your son's friend I beg you to\r\nconsider--\"\r\n\r\n\"Impudence,\" declared Mama, pointing the sword at me so that I\r\ninvoluntarily backed up although already at a respectful distance.\r\n\r\n\"Damned impudence,\" she repeated, feeding another page to the fire.\r\n\"Came into my house, bold as brass and said, 'Cream if you please.' Ha!\r\nI'll cream him, I will!\" And she made a violent gesture with the saber\r\nas though skewering me upon its length.\r\n\r\nI whispered to Constance, who was standing closest, that her mother had\r\nundoubtedly lost her reason and should be forcibly restrained. Unhappily\r\nthe old lady's keen ears caught my suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Oho. 'Deranged,' am I? I spend my life making more money than I can\r\nspend, do I? I push my way against all decency into the company of my\r\nbetters, boring them and myself for no earthly reason, do I? I live on\r\ncrackers and milk because Ive spent my nervous energy piling up the\r\nmeans to buy an endless supply of steaks and chops my doctor forbids me\r\nto eat? I starve my employees half to death in order to give the money I\r\nsteal from them to some charity which hands a small part of it back, ay?\r\nI hire lobbyists or bribe officials to pass laws and then employ others\r\nto break them? I foster nationalist organizations with one hand and\r\nbuild up international cartels with the other, do I? I'm crazy, am I?\"\r\n\r\nExcited by her own rhetoric she put several pages at once into the\r\nflames. Constance pleaded, \"Mama, this is all we have left of Joe.\r\nPlease, Mama.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sundays the church banner is raised above the Flag. I never heard a\r\npost chaplain say immortality was contained on pieces of paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Comfort, then, Mama,\" suggested Winifred.\r\n\r\n\"Creative work,\" muttered the general.\r\n\r\n\"Is it some trivial thing to endure the pangs of childbed that the\r\ncreations of men are so exalted? I have offered my life on a battlefield\r\nno less and no more than my grandfather fought on at Chancellorsville.\r\nLittle minds do not judge, but I judge. I bore a son; he was my\r\nextension as this weapon is my extension.\"\r\n\r\nShe thrust the sword forward to emphasize her utterance. \"I will not\r\nhesitate to judge my son. If he did not die in proper uniform at least I\r\nshall not have him go down as a maker of piano notes instead of\r\nbuglecalls.\" She threw the balance of the score into the fire and\r\nstirred it into a blaze with the steel's point.\r\n\r\nThe ringing of the telephonebell put a period to the scene. Constance,\r\nwho spoke several languages, answered it. She carried on an\r\nincomprehensible conversation for a minute and then motioned to me with\r\nher head. \"It's for you, Mr Weener. Rio. I'll wait till they get the\r\nconnection through.\" She turned to the mouthpiece again and encouraged\r\nthe operator with a soothing flow of words.\r\n\r\nI was vastly relieved at the interruption. It was undoubtedly Preblesham\r\ncalling me on some routine matter, but it served to distract attention\r\nfrom the still muttering old lady and give her a chance to subside.\r\n\r\nPreblesham's voice came in a bodiless waver over the miles. \"A W? Can\r\nyou hear me? I can give you a tip. Just about three hours ahead of the\r\nradio and newspapers. Can you understand me? Our big competitor has\r\nbought the adjoining property. Do you get me, A W?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded at the receiver as though he could see me, my thoughts racing\r\nfuriously ahead. I had understood him all right: the Grass had somehow\r\njumped the saltwater gap and was loose upon another continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_73._ I had about three hours in which to dispose of all my South\r\nAmerican holdings before their value vanished. Telephone facilities in\r\nthe Thario house, though adequate for the transaction of the general's\r\ndaily business, were completely unequal to the emergency. Even if they\r\nhad not been, Mama's occasional sallies from her fireplace fort, saber\r\nwaving threateningly, frequently endangered half our communications and\r\nwe suffered all the while from the idiosyncrasies of the continental\r\noperators who seem unable ever to make a clear connection, varying this\r\nannoyance by a habit of either dropping dead or visiting the nearest\r\ncafé at those crucial moments when they did not interrupt a tense\r\ninterchange by polite inquiries as to whether msieu had been connected.\r\n\r\nI must say that in this crisis Stuart Thario displayed all his soldierly\r\nqualities to the full. Sweeping aside his domestic concerns as he would\r\nat the order of mobilization, he became swift, decisive, vigorous. The\r\nfirst call he put through was to the Kristian IV Hotel, engaging every\r\navailable empty room so that we might preempt as much of the switchboard\r\nas possible. Pressing Constance and Winifred into service as secretaries\r\nuntil his own officestaff could be summoned and leaving Pauline to deal\r\nwith Mama, he had us established in the hotel less than threequarters of\r\nan hour from the time Preblesham phoned.\r\n\r\nEven as the earliest calls were being put through a barely perceptible\r\nsignal passed from the general to Winifred and presently large parts of\r\nthe Kristian IV bar were being arranged on a long table at the general's\r\nelbow. I had little time for observation since I had to exert all my\r\npowers of salesmanship on unseen financiers to persuade them by\r\nindirection that I was facing a financial crisis and they had a chance\r\nto snap up my South American holdings at fractions of their values; but\r\nout of the corner of my eye I admired the way Stuart Thario continuously\r\nsipped from his constantly refilled glass without hesitating in his\r\nduplicating endeavors.\r\n\r\nI expected the news to break and end our efforts at any moment, but the\r\nquickness with which I had seized upon Preblesham's information\r\nconfirmed the proverb about the early bird; the threehour reprieve\r\nstretched to five and by the time Havas flashed the news I had liquefied\r\nalmost all of my now worthless assets--and to potential financial\r\nrivals. Needless to say I had not trusted solely to the honor of the men\r\nwith whom I had conversed, but had the sale confirmed in each case by an\r\nagent on the spot who accepted a check, draft, or cash from the buyer.\r\nOnly on paper did I suffer the slightest loss; in actuality my position\r\nbecame three times as strong as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n_74._ The world took the extension of the Grass to South America with a\r\nphilosophic calm which can only be described as amazing. Even the Latins\r\nthemselves seemed more concerned with how the Grass had jumped the gap\r\nthan with the impending fate of their continent. The generally accepted\r\ntheory was that it had somehow mysteriously come by way of the West\r\nIndies, although as yet the Grass had not appeared on any of those\r\nislands, and even Cuba, within sight of the submerged Florida Keys, was\r\napparently safe behind her protective supercyclone fans. But the fact\r\nthe Grass had appeared first at Medellin in Colombia rather than in the\r\ntiny bit of Panama remaining seemed to show it had not come directly\r\nfrom the daggerpointed mass poised above the continent.\r\n\r\n_La Prensa_ of Buenos Aires said in a long editorial entitled \"Does\r\nHumanity Betray Itself?\": \"When the Colossus of the North was evilly\r\nenchanted, many Americans (except possibly our friends across the River\r\nPlate) breathed more easily. Now it would seem their rejoicing was\r\npremature and the doom of the Yankee is also to be the doom of our older\r\ncivilization. How did this verdant disease spread from one continent to\r\nanother? That is the question which tortures every human heart from the\r\nAntarctic to the Caribbean.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed the cordon around North America has not been generally\r\nrespected. Scientists with the noblest motives, and adventurers urged on\r\nby the basest, are alike believed to have visited the forbidden\r\ncontinent. It may well be that on one of these trips the seeds of the\r\ngigantic _Cynodon dactylon_ were brought back. It is well known that the\r\nagents of a certain Yankee capitalist have been accustomed to taking off\r\non mysterious journeys near the very spot now afflicted by the emerald\r\nplague.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a dastardly hint and the sort of thing I had long come to look\r\nupon as inseparable from my position. Of all peoples the Latinamericans\r\nhave long been known as the most notoriously ungrateful for the work we\r\ndid in developing their countries. Why, in some backward parts, the\r\nnatives had been content to live by hunting and fishing till we\r\nfurnished them with employment and paid them enough so they could buy\r\nsalt fish and canned meats. Fortunately _La Prensa_'s innuendo, so\r\nobviously inspired by envy, was not taken up, and attention soon turned\r\nfrom the insoluble problem of the bridging of the gap to the southward\r\nprogress of the weed itself.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first, everyone took for granted the victory of the Grass.\r\nNo concerted efforts were made either to confine or to destroy it. The\r\nWorld Congress to Combat the Grass, far from being inactive, worked\r\nheroically, but it got little cooperation from the peoples most closely\r\naffected. When at one time it seemed as though the congress had got hold\r\nof a possible weapon, the Venezuelans refused them the necessary sites\r\nand Brazil would not allow passage of foreign soldiers over its soil.\r\nNationalism suddenly became rampant. \"We will die as Ecuadorians,\r\ndescendants of the Incas,\" exclaimed the leading newspaper of Quito.\r\n_El Gaucho_ of Lima pointed out caustically that most of Ecuador's area\r\nreally belonged to Peru and the Peruvians were the true descendants of\r\nthe Incas anyway. \"We shall all die as unashamed Peruvians!\" thundered\r\n_El Gaucho_.\r\n\r\nIn vain the Church pointed out the difference between Christian\r\nresignation and sinful suicide. The reply of most South Americans, when\r\nthey bothered to reply at all, was either that the coming of the Grass\r\nexpressed God's will toward them or else to scorn the Church entirely.\r\nImitations of Brother Paul's movement flourished, with additions and\r\nrefinements suited to the Latin temperament.\r\n\r\nSo the efforts of the World Congress were almost entirely limited to\r\nsearching each ship, plane, and individual leaving the doomed continent\r\nto be sure none of the fatal seeds were transported. Even this\r\nprecaution was resented as an infringement on national sovereignty, but\r\nthe resentment was limited to bellicose pronouncements in the\r\nnewspapers; the republics looked on sullenly while their honor was\r\nsystematically violated by phlegmatic inspectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_75._ The Grass grew to unheardof heights in the tropical valley of the\r\nAmazon. It washed the slopes of the Andes as it had the Cordilleras and\r\nthe Rockies, leaving only the highest peaks free of its presence. It\r\nraced across the llanos, the savannas and the pampas and covered the\r\nhigh plateaus in a slow relentless growth.\r\n\r\nThe people ran from the Grass, not in a straight line from north to\r\nsouth, but by indirection, seeking first the seacoasts and then escape\r\nfrom the afflicted land. Those North Americans who had eluded the Grass\r\nonce did not satisfy themselves with halfmeasures when their sanctuary\r\nwas lost, but bought passage on any bottom capable, however dubiously,\r\nof keeping out the sea and embarked for the farthest regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_76._ In point of time, I am now about halfway through my narrative. It\r\nis hard to believe that only eleven years have passed since the Grass\r\nconquered South America; indeed, it is extraordinarily difficult for me\r\nto reconstruct these middle years at all. Not because they were hard or\r\nunpleasant--on the contrary, they carried me from one success to\r\nanother--but because they have, in memory, the dreamlike quality of\r\nunreality, elusive, vague and tantalizing.\r\n\r\nLike a dream, too, was the actual progress of the Grass. We were all, I\r\nthink, impressed by the sense of repetition, of a scene enacted over and\r\nover again. It was this quality which gives my story, now that I look\r\nback upon it, a certain distortion, for no one, hearing it for the first\r\ntime, and not as any reader of these words must be, thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the events, could believe in the efforts made to combat the Grass.\r\nThese efforts existed; we did not yield without struggles; we fought for\r\nSouth America as we had fought for North America. But it was a nightmare\r\nfight; our endeavors seem retrospectively those of the paralyzed....\r\n\r\nThe Grass gripped the continent's great northern bulge, squeezed it into\r\nsubmission and worked its way southward to the slender tip, driving the\r\ninhabitants before it, duplicating previous acts by sending an influx\r\nfrom sparsely to thickly settled areas, creating despair, terror,\r\ndisruption and confusion; pestilence, hysteria and famine.\r\n\r\nThe drama was not played through in one act, but many; to a world\r\nwaiting the conclusion it dragged on through interminable months and\r\nyears, offering no change, no sudden twists of fortune, no elusive\r\nhopes. At last, mercifully, the tragedy ended; the green curtain came\r\ndown and covered the continent to the Strait of Magellan. The Grass\r\nlooked wistfully across at Tierra del Fuego, the land of ice and fire,\r\nbut even its voracity balked, momentarily at any rate, at the\r\ninhospitable island and left it to whatever refugees chose its shores as\r\na slower but still certain death.\r\n\r\nSouth America finally gone, the rest of the globe breathed easier. It\r\nwould be a slander on humanity to say there was actual rejoicing when\r\nthe World Congress sealed off this continent too, but whatever sorrow\r\nwas felt for its loss was balanced by the feeling that at long last the\r\nperil of the Grass was finally ended. No longer would speculative\r\nGermans, thoughtful Chinese or wakeful Englishmen wonder if the\r\nsupercyclone fans were indeed an effective barrier; no longer would\r\nCubans, Colombians or Venezuelans look northward apprehensively. Oceanic\r\nbarriers now confined the peril and though the world was shrunken and\r\nhurt it was yet alive. More, it was free from fear for the first time\r\nsince the mutated seeds had blown over the saltband.\r\n\r\nI must not give the impression that a wiping off of the Grass from the\r\naccountbooks of humanity was universal and complete. The World Congress\r\nperiodically considered proposals for countermeasures. On the top of\r\nMount Whitney Miss Francis still labored. New assistants were flown to\r\nher as the old ones wandered down the great rockslide from the old stone\r\nweatherhouse off into the Grass during fits of despondency, went mad\r\nfrom the realization that, except for problematical survivors on the\r\npolar caps, they were alone in an abandoned hemisphere, or died of\r\nsimple homesickness. In the researchlaboratories of Consolidated\r\nPemmican formulas for utilizing the Grass were still tinkered with, and\r\nthe death of almost every publicspirited man of fortune revealed a will\r\ncontaining bequests to aid those seeking means of controlling the weed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_77._ It is not, afterall, a detached history of the past twentyone\r\nyears I am writing. Contemporaries are only too well aware of the facts\r\nand posterity will find them dehydrated in textbooks. I started out to\r\ntell of my own personal part in the coming of the Grass, not to take an\r\nOlympian and aloof view of the passion of man.\r\n\r\nThe very mention of a personal part brings to mind a subject which might\r\nbe painful were I of a petty nature. There were people who, willfully\r\nblind to the facts, held me responsible, in the face of all reason, for\r\nthe Grass itself. Although it is difficult to believe, there have been\r\nmany occasions when I have been denounced by demagogues and my blood\r\ncalled for by vicious mobs.\r\n\r\nBut enough of morbid retrospection. I think I can say at this time there\r\nwas, with the exception of certain Indian nabobs, hardly a wealthy man\r\nleft in the world who did not owe in some way the retention of his\r\nriches to me. I controlled more than half the steel industry; I owned\r\noutright the majority stocks of the world oil cartel; coal, iron,\r\ncopper, tin and other mines either belonged directly to me or to\r\ntributary companies in which I held large interests.\r\n\r\nAlong with the demagoguery of attributing the Grass to Albert Weener\r\nthere was the agitation for socialism and the expropriation of all\r\nprivate property, the attempt to deprive men of the fruit of their\r\nendeavor and reduce everyone to a regimented, miserable level. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that I spared no effort to combat the insidious\r\nagents of the Fourth International. Fortunately for the preservation of\r\nthe free enterprise system, I had tools ready to hand.\r\n\r\nThe overrunning of the United States wiped out the gangs which operated\r\nso freely there, but remnants made their escape, taking with them to the\r\nolder continents their philosophy of life and property. Gathering native\r\nrecruits, they began following the familiar patterns and would in time\r\nno doubt have divided the world into countless minute baronies.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was able to subsidize and reason with enough of their leaders\r\nto persuade them that their livelihood and very existence rested on a\r\nbasis of private property and that their great danger came not from each\r\nother, but from the advocates of socialism. They saw the point, and\r\nthough they did not cease from warring on each other, or mulcting the\r\ngeneral public, they were ruthless in exterminating the socialists and\r\nthey left the goods and adjuncts of Consolidated Pemmican and Allied\r\nIndustries scrupulously unmolested.\r\n\r\nStrange as it sounds, it was not my part in protecting the world from\r\nthe philosophy of equality, nor my ramified properties, which gave me\r\nmy unique position. Unbelievably, because the change had occurred so\r\ngradually, industry, though still a vital factor, no longer played the\r\ndominant role in the world, but had given the position back to an\r\nearlier occupant. Food was once more paramount in global economy. Loss\r\nof the Americas had cut the supply in half without reducing the\r\npopulation correspondingly. The Socialist Union remained selfsufficient\r\nand uninterested, while Australia, New Zealand and the cultivated\r\nportions of Africa strove to feed the millions of Europeans and Asiatics\r\nwhose lands could not grow enough for their own use. The slightest\r\nfalling off of the harvest produced famine.\r\n\r\nAt this point Consolidated Pemmican practically took over the entire\r\nbusiness of agriculture. Utilizing byproducts, and crops otherwise not\r\nworth gathering, waste materials, and growths inedible without\r\nprocessing, with plants strung out all over the four continents and with\r\ntremendously reduced shipping costs because of the small compass in\r\nwhich so much food could be contained, we were able to let our customers\r\nearn their daily concentrates by gathering the raw materials which went\r\ninto them. I was not only the wealthiest, most powerful man in the\r\nworld, but its savior and providence as well.\r\n\r\nWith the new feeling of security bathing the world, tension dissolved\r\ninto somnolence and the tempo of daily life slackened until it scarcely\r\nseemed to move at all. The waves of anxiety, suspicion and distrust of\r\nan earlier decade calmed into peaceful ripples, hardly noticeable in a\r\npondlike existence.\r\n\r\nNo longer beset by thoughts or fears of wars, nations relaxed their\r\npride, armies were reduced to little more than palaceguards, brassbands\r\nand parade units; while navies were kept up--if periodic painting and\r\nretaining in commission a few obsolete cruisers and destroyers be so\r\ntermed--only to patrol the Atlantic and Pacific shores of the lost\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for existence almost disappeared; the wagescales set by\r\nConsolidated Pemmican were enough to sustain life, and in a world of\r\nlimited horizons men became content with that. The bickering\r\ncharacteristic of industrial dispute vanished; along with it went the\r\noutmoded weapon of the tradesunion. It was a halcyon world and if, as\r\ncranks complained, illiteracy increased rapidly, it could only be\r\nbecause with everyman's livelihood assured his natural indolence took\r\nthe upper hand and he not only lost refinements superficially acquired,\r\nbut was uninterested in teaching them to his children.\r\n\r\n\r\n_78._ I don't know how I can express the golden, sunlit quality of this\r\nperiod. It was not an heroic age, no great deeds were performed, no\r\nconflicts resolved, no fundamentshaking ideas broached. Quiet, peace,\r\ncontent--these were the keywords of the era. Preoccupation with politics\r\nand panaceas gave place to healthier interests: sports and pageants and\r\ngiant fairs. Men became satisfied with their lot and if they to a great\r\nextent discarded speculation and disquieting philosophies they found a\r\nuseful substitute in quiet meditation.\r\n\r\nUntil now I had never had the time to live in a manner befitting my\r\nstation; but with my affairs running so smoothly that even Stuart Thario\r\nand Tony Preblesham found idle time, I began to turn my attention to the\r\neasier side of life. Of course I never considered making my permanent\r\nhome anywhere but in England; for all its parochialism and oddities it\r\nwas the nearest I could come to approximating my own country.\r\n\r\nI bought a gentleman's park in Hampshire and had the outmoded house torn\r\ndown. It had been built in Elizabethan times and was cold, drafty and\r\nuncomfortable, with not one modern convenience. For a time I considered\r\npreserving it intact as a sort of museumpiece and building another home\r\nfor myself on the grounds, but when I was assured by experts that Tudor\r\narchitecture was not considered to be of surpassing merit and I could\r\nfind in addition no other advantageous site, I ordered its removal.\r\n\r\nI called in the best architects for consultation, but my own artistic\r\nand practical sense, as they themselves were quick to acknowledge,\r\nfurnished the basis for the beautiful mansion I put up. Moved by\r\nnostalgic memories of my lost Southland I built a great and ample\r\nbungalow of some sixty rooms--stucco, topped with asbestos tile. Since\r\nthe Spanish motif natural to this form would have been out of place in\r\nEngland and therefore in bad taste, I had timbers set in the stucco,\r\nalthough of course they performed no function but that of decoration,\r\nthe supports being framework which was not visible.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful and satisfying to come into the spacious and cozy\r\nlivingroom, filled with overstuffed easychairs and comfortable couches,\r\nwarmed by the most efficient of centralheating systems or to use one of\r\nthe perfectly appointed bathrooms whose every fixture was the best money\r\ncould buy and recall the dank stone floors and walls leading up to a\r\nmammoth and--from a thermal point of view--perfectly useless fireplace\r\nflanked by the coatsofarms of deadandgone gentry who were content to\r\nshuffle out on inclement mornings to answer nature's calls in chilly\r\nouthouses.\r\n\r\nSo large and commodious an establishment required an enormous staff of\r\nservants, which in turn called for a housekeeper and a steward to\r\nsupervise their activities, for as I have observed many times, the\r\nfarther down one goes on the wagescale the more it is necessary to hire\r\na highsalaried executive to see that the wage is earned.\r\n\r\nI cannot say in general that I ever learned to distinguish between one\r\nretainer and another, except of course my personal manservant and\r\nBurlet, the headbutler whom I hired right from under the nose of the\r\nMarquis of Arpers--his lordship being unable to match my offer. But in\r\nspite of the confusion caused by such a multiplicity of menials, I one\r\nday noticed an undergardener whose face was tantalizingly familiar. He\r\ntouched his cap respectfully as I approached, but I had the curious\r\nfeeling that it was a taught gesture and not one which came naturally to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been here long, my good man?\" I asked, still trying to place\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" he answered, \"about two weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny. I'm almost certain Ive noticed you before.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and made a tentative gesture with the hoe or rake or\r\nwhatever the tool was in his hand, as though he would now, with my\r\npermission, resume his labors.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" I inquired, not believing it would jog my memory,\r\nbut out of a natural politeness toward inferiors who always feel\r\nflattered by such attention.\r\n\r\n\"Dinkman,\" he muttered. \"Adam Dinkman.\"\r\n\r\n... That incredibly dilapidated frontlawn, overrun with sickly\r\ndevilgrass and spotted with bald patches. Mrs Dinkman's mean bargaining\r\nwith a tired man who was doing no more than trying to make a living and\r\nher later domineering harshness toward someone who was in no way\r\nresponsible for the misfortune which overcame her. I wondered if she\r\nwere still alive or had lost her life in the Grass while an indigent on\r\npublic charity. It is indeed a small world, I thought, and how far we\r\nhave both come since I humbled myself in order to put food in my stomach\r\nand keep a roof over my head.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Dinkman,\" I said, turning away.\r\n\r\nA warm feeling for a fellow American caused me to call in my steward and\r\nbid him give Dinkman £100, a small fortune to an undergardener, and let\r\nhim go. Though he might not realize it immediately, I was doing him a\r\ntremendous favor, for an American with £100 in England was bound to do\r\nbetter for himself in some small business than he could hope to do as a\r\nmere servant.\r\n\r\nLooking back upon this too brief time of tranquillity and satisfaction I\r\ncannot help but sigh for its passing. Preceded and followed by periods\r\nof turbulence and stress, it stands out in my life as an incredible\r\nmoment, a soothing dream. Perhaps a faint defect, so small as to be\r\nalmost unnoticed, was a feeling of solitariness--an inevitable\r\nconcomitant of my position--but this was so slight that I could not even\r\ndefine it as loneliness and like many another defect it merely\r\nheightened the charm of the whole.\r\n\r\nI had wealth, power, the respect of the world. The unavoidable\r\ndetachment from the mob was mitigated by simple pleasures. My estate\r\nwas a constant delight; the quaint survivals of feudalism among the\r\ntenantry amused me; and though I could not bring myself to pretend an\r\ninterest in the absurd affectation of foxhunting, I was well received by\r\nthe county people, whose insularity and aloofness I found greatly\r\nexaggerated, perhaps by outsiders not as cosmopolitan as myself.\r\n\r\nExcursions to London and other cities where my presence was demanded or\r\ncould be helpful afforded me a frequent change of scene and visits by\r\nimportant people as well as more intimate ones by Preblesham and the\r\nTharios prevented The Ivies--for so my place was called--from ever\r\nbecoming dull to me.\r\n\r\nThe general fell in love with a certain ale which was brewed on the\r\npremises and declared, in spite of his lifelong rule to the contrary,\r\nthat it could be mixed with Irish whisky to make a drink so agreeable\r\nthat no sane man would want a better. The girls, particularly Winifred,\r\nwere enchanted with my private woods, the gardens and the deerpark; but\r\nMama, throughout their visits, remained almost entirely silent and aloof\r\nexcept for the rare remarks which seemed to burst from her as though by\r\nan inescapable inward compulsion. These were always insulting and always\r\ndirected at me, but I overlooked them, knowing her to be deranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n_79._ Perhaps one of the things I most enjoyed about The Ivies was\r\nwandering through its acres, breathing through my pores, as it were, the\r\nsense of possession. I was walking through the cowslips and violets\r\npunctuating the meadow bordering one of the many little streams, when I\r\ncame upon a fellow roughly dressed, the pockets of his shootingjacket\r\nbulging and a fishingline in his hand. For a moment I thought him one of\r\nthe gamekeepers and nodded, but his quick look and furtive gestures\r\ninstantly revealed him as a poacher.\r\n\r\n\"Youre trespassing, you know,\" I said with some severity.\r\n\r\n\"I know, guvner,\" he admitted readily, \"but I wasnt doing no harm; just\r\nlooking at this bit of water here and listening to the birds.\"\r\n\r\n\"With a fishingline in your hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, guvner, that's by way of being a precaution. You see, when I\r\ngo out on a little expedition like this, to inspect the beauties of\r\nnature--which I admit I have no right to do, they being on someone\r\nelse's land--I always say to myself, 'Suppose you run into some gent\r\nlooking at a lovely fat trout in a brook and he hasnt got no fishline\r\nwith him? What could be more philanthropic than I produce my bit of\r\nstring and help him out?' Aint that a proper Christian attitude,\r\nguvner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly; but what, may I ask, makes your pockets bulge so\r\nsuspiciously? Is that another philanthropy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Accident, guvner, sheer accident. Walking along like this with my head\r\ndown I always seem to come upon two or three dead hares or now and then\r\na partridge or grouse. Natural mortality, you understand. Well, what\r\ncould be more humane than to stuff them in my pockets and take them home\r\nfor proper burial?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know in spite of all the Labour Governments and strange doings in\r\nParliament, there are still pretty strict laws against poaching.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poaching, guvner? I wouldnt poach. I respect what's yours, just as I\r\nrespect what's my own. Trespassing maybe. I likes to look at a little\r\nbit of sky or hear a meadowlark or smell a flower or two, but\r\npoaching--! Really, guvner, you hadnt ought to take away a man's\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it a shame so sturdy and amusing a fellow should have to eke\r\nout his living so precariously. \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" I said.\r\n\"I'll give you a note right now to my head gamekeeper and have him put\r\nyou on as an assistant. Thirty shillings a week I think it pays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, thank you, guvner, but really, I don't want it. Thirty bob a\r\nweek! What should I do with it? Nothing but go down to the Holly Tree\r\nand get drunk every night. I'm much better off as I am--total\r\nabstinence, in a manner of speaking. No, no, guvner, I appreciate your\r\nbig heart, but I'm happy with my little bit of fish and a rabbit in the\r\npot--why should I set up to be an honest workingman and get dissatisfied\r\nwith my life?\"\r\n\r\nHis refusal of my wellintentioned offer did not irk me. In a large and\r\ntolerant view you could almost say we were both parasites upon The Ivies\r\nand it would not hurt me if he stole a little of my game to keep himself\r\nalive. I gave him a note to protect him against any of the keepers who\r\nmight come upon him as I had, and we parted with mutual liking; I\r\nremembering for my part that I was an American and all men, poacher and\r\nlandlord alike, were created equal, no matter how far each had come from\r\nhis beginnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_80._ Shortly after, Miss Francis ended her long sojourn at Mount\r\nWhitney and returned to England. The ordeal of living surrounded by the\r\nGrass, which had destroyed her assistants, seemed to have made no other\r\nchange in her than the fading of her hair, which was now completely\r\nwhite, and a loss of weight, giving her a deceptive appearance of\r\nfragility at variance with the forthrightness of her manner.\r\n\r\nI put down her immunity to agoraphobia as just another evidence that she\r\nwas already mad. Her refusal to accept the limitations of her sex and\r\nher complete indifference to our respective stations were mere\r\nconfirmations. With her usual disregard of realities she assumed I would\r\ngo on financing her indefinitely in spite of the hundreds of thousands\r\nof pounds I had paid out without visible result.\r\n\r\n\"Ive really got it now, Weener,\" she assured me in a tone hardly\r\nbefitting a suppliant for funds. \"In spite of the incompetents you kept\r\nsending, in spite of mistakes and blind alleys, the work on Whitney is\r\ndone--and successfully. The rest is routine laboratory work--a matter of\r\nquantities and methods of application.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I can spare you any more money, Miss Francis.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"What the devil's the matter with you, Weener? Are your\r\nmillions melting away? Or do you think any of the spies you set on me\r\ncapable of carrying on--or are you just trying to crack the whip?\"\r\n\r\n\"I set no spies and I have no whip. I merely feel it may not be\r\nprofitable to waste any more money on fruitless experiments.\"\r\n\r\nShe snorted. \"Time has streamlined and inflated your platitudes. When I\r\nam too old to work and ready for euthanasia I shall have you come and\r\ntalk me to death. To hear you one would almost think you had no interest\r\nin finding a method to counter the Grass.\"\r\n\r\nHer egomania and impertinence were really insufferable; her notion of\r\nher own importance was ludicrous.\r\n\r\n\"Interested or not, I have no reason to believe you alone are capable of\r\nscientific discovery. Anyway, the world seems pretty well off as it is.\"\r\n\r\nShe tugged at her hair as if it were false and would come off if she\r\njerked hard enough. \"Of course it's well enough off from your\r\npointofview. It offers you more food than you could eat if you had a\r\nmillion bellies, more clothes than you could wear out in a million\r\nyears, more houses than you could live in if the million contradictions\r\nwhich go to make up any single human were suddenly made corporeal. Of\r\ncourse youre satisfied; why shouldnt you be? If the Grass were to be\r\npushed back and the world once more enlarged, if hope and\r\ndissatisfaction were again to replace despair and content, you might not\r\nfind yourself such a big toad in a small puddle--and you wouldnt like\r\nthat, would you?\"\r\n\r\nI had intended all along to give her a small pension to keep her from\r\nwant and allow her to putter around, but her irrational accusations and\r\ninsults only showed her to be the kind from whom no gratitude could be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we can be of no further use to each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Weener, you can't do this. The life of civilization depends\r\non countering the Grass. Don't tell me the world can go on only half\r\nalive. Look around you and notice the recession every day. Outside of\r\nyour own subservient laboratories what scientific work is being done?\r\nSince Palomar and Mount Wilson and Flagstaff went what has happened in\r\nastronomy? If you pick up the shrunken pages of your _Times_ or\r\n_Tatler_, do you wonder at the reason for their shrinkage or do you\r\nrealize there are fewer literates in the world than there were ten years\r\nago?\r\n\r\n\"The Americas were upstart continents, werent they? I am not speaking\r\nsarcastically, my point is not a chauvinistic one, not even\r\nhemispherically prideful. And the Old World the womb of culture? But how\r\nmuch culture has that womb borne since the Americas disappeared? Without\r\na doubt there are exactly the same number of composers and painters,\r\nwriters and sculptors alive on the four continents today as there were\r\nwhen there were six, but in this drowsy halfworld how many books of\r\nimportance are being produced?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of books already in existence; besides, those things\r\ngo by cycles.\"\r\n\r\n\"God give me patience; this is the man who has humanity prostrate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humanity seems quite content in the position you ascribe to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, of course--that's the tragedy. It's content the same way a\r\nman who has just had his legs cut off is content; suffering from shock\r\nand loss of blood he enters a merciful coma from which he may never\r\nemerge. The legs do not write the books or think the thoughts, whether\r\nthese activities wait for the cyclical moment or not, but the brain,\r\ndependent on the circulation of the blood and the wellbeing of the rest\r\nof the body for proper functioning. And who are you, little man, to\r\nstand in the way of assisting the patient?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not argue with you any further, Miss Francis. If mankind is\r\nreally as subject to your efforts as your conceit leads you to believe\r\nthen I am sure you will find some way to continue them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I will,\" she said, and we left it at that.\r\n\r\nTo say her accusations had been gravely unjust would be to defend myself\r\nwhere no defense is called for. I merely remark in passing that I gave\r\norders to set aside a still greater fund toward finding a reagent\r\nagainst the Grass, and to put those who had lately assisted Miss Francis\r\nin charge. I did this, not because I swallowed her strained analogy\r\nabout a sufferer with his legs cut off, but for purely practical\r\nreasons. The world was very well as it was, but an effective weapon\r\nagainst the Grass might at last make possible the neverdiscarded vision\r\nof utilizing it beneficially.\r\n\r\n\r\n_81._ Meanwhile life went on with a smoothness strange and gratifying to\r\nthose of us born into a period of strife and restlessness. No more wars,\r\nstrikes, riots, agitation for higher wages or social experiments by\r\nwildeyed fanatics. Those whose limitations laid out a career of toil\r\nperformed their function with as much efficiency as one could expect and\r\nwe others who had risen and separated ourselves from the herd carried\r\nour responsibilities and accepted the rewards which went with them. The\r\nships of the World Congress continued patrolling the coasts of the\r\ndeserted continents and restrictions were so far relaxed as to permit\r\nplaneflights over the area to take motionpictures and confirm the Grass\r\nhad lost none of its vigor. Beyond this, the generality of mankind\r\nforgot the weed and the regions it covered, living geographically as\r\nthough Columbus had never set forth from Palos.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time a new philosophic idea was advanced--giving the lie\r\nto Miss Francis' dictum that no new thoughts were being thought--which\r\nwas, briefly, that the Grass was essentially a good thing in itself;\r\nthat the world had not merely made the best of a bad situation, but had\r\nbeen brought to a beneficent condition through the loss of the Western\r\nHemisphere. Mankind had desperately needed a brake upon its heedless\r\ncourse; some instrumentality to limit it and bring it to realization of\r\nits proper province. The Grass had acted as such an agent and now,\r\nrightly chastised, man could go about his fit business.\r\n\r\nThis concept gained almost immediate popular support, so far as it\r\nfiltered down to the masses at all; prominent schoolmen endorsed it\r\nwholeheartedly; statesmen gave it qualified approval--\"in\r\nprinciple\"--and the Pope issued an encyclical calling for a return of\r\nChristian resignation and submission. Hardly was the ink dry upon the\r\nexpressions of thanksgiving for the punishment which had brought about a\r\nnew and better frameofmind than the philosophy was suddenly and\r\ndramatically tested by events.\r\n\r\nThe island of Juan Fernandez, Robinson Crusoe's island, a peak pushed\r\nout of the waters of the Pacific 400 miles west of Chile, densely\r\npopulated with refugees and a base for patrolboats, was overrun by the\r\nGrass. It was an impossible happening. Every inhabitant had had personal\r\nexperience of the Grass and was fearfully alert against its appearance.\r\nThe patrols covered the sea between it and the mainland constantly; the\r\ndistance was too far for windborne seeds. The tenuous hypothesis that\r\ngulls had acted as carriers was accepted simply for want of a better.\r\n\r\nBut the World Congress wasted no time looking backward. Although between\r\nJuan Fernandez and the next land westward the distance was three times\r\ngreater than between it and South America, the Congress seized upon the\r\nonly island to which it could possibly spread, Sala-y-Gomez, and made of\r\nit a veritable fortress against the Grass. Not only did ships guard its\r\nwaters by day and keep it brilliantly lit with their searchlights at\r\nnight, but swift pursuitplanes bristling with machineguns brought down\r\nevery bird in flight within a thousand miles.\r\n\r\nThe island itself was sown with salt a halfmile thick after being mined\r\nwith enough explosives to blow it into the sea. The world, or that\r\nportion of it which had not fully accepted all the implications of the\r\ndoctrine of submission, watched eagerly. But the ships patrolled an\r\nempty sea, the searchlights reflected only the glittering saline\r\ncrystals, the migrant birds never reached their destination. The outpost\r\nheld, impregnable. Again everyone breathed easier.\r\n\r\nFive hundred miles beyond this focalpoint, its convict settlement long\r\nabandoned, was Easter Island, Rapa Nui, home of the great monoliths\r\nwhose origin had ever been a puzzle. Erect or supine, these colossal\r\nstatues were strewn all over the island. Anthropologists and\r\narchaeologists still came to give them cursory inspection and it was on\r\nsuch a visit an unmistakable clump of Grass was found.\r\n\r\nImmediately the ships were rushed from Sala-y-Gomez, planes carrying\r\ntons of salt took off from Australia and the whole machinery of the\r\nWorld Congress was swiftly put in operation. But it was too late; Easter\r\nIsland was swamped, uninhabited Ducie went next, and Pitcairn, home of\r\nthe descendants of the _Bounty_ mutineers followed before even the\r\nslightest precautions could be taken. The Grass was jumping gaps of\r\nthousands of miles in a breathless steeplechase.\r\n\r\nOn Pitcairn there was nothing to do but rescue the inhabitants. Vessels\r\nstood by to carry them and their livestock off. The palebrown men and\r\nwomen left for the most part docilely, but the last Adams and the last\r\nMcCoy refused to go. \"Once before, our people were forced to leave\r\nPitcairn and found nothing but unhappiness. We will stay on the island\r\nto which our fathers brought their wives.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no stopping the Grass now, even if the means had been to hand.\r\nThe Gambiers, the Tuamotus and the Marquesas were swallowed up. Tahiti,\r\ndwellingplace of beautiful if syphilitic women, disappeared under a\r\ngreen blanket, as did the Cook Islands, Samoa and the Fijis. The Grass\r\njumped southward to a foothold in New Zealand and northward into\r\nMicronesia. Panic infected the Australians and a mass migration to the\r\ncentral part of the country was begun, but with little hope the\r\nsurrounding deserts would offer any effective barrier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_82._ My first thought when I heard the Grass for the second time had\r\nbroken its bounds, was that I had perhaps been a little hasty with Miss\r\nFrancis. It was not at all likely she would succeed where so many better\r\ntrained and better equipped scientists had so far failed, but I felt a\r\nvicarious sympathy with her, as being out of the picture when all her\r\ncolleagues were striving with might and main to save the world;\r\nespecially after the years she had spent on Mount Whitney. It would be\r\nan act of simple generosity on my part, I thought, to give her the\r\nwherewithal to entertain the illusion of importance. When all was said\r\nand done, she was a woman, and I could afford a chivalrous gesture even\r\nin the face of her overweening arrogance.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say she responded with complete illgrace. \"I knew youd\r\neventually have to come crawling to me to save your hide.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake the situation entirely, Miss Francis,\" I informed her with\r\ndignity. \"I am conferring, not asking favors. I have every confidence in\r\nmy research staff--\"\r\n\r\n\"My God! Those guineapig murderers; those discoveryforgers; those\r\nwhitesmocked acolytes in the temple of Yes. You value your life or your\r\npurse at exactly what theyre worth if you expect those drugstoreclerks\r\nto preserve them for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if either is in the slightest danger,\" I assured her\r\nconfidently. \"Hysterics have lost perspective. Long before the Grass\r\nbecomes an immediate concern my drugstoreclerks, with less exalted\r\nopinions of their talents than you, will have found the means to destroy\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"A soothing fairytale. Weener, the truth is not in you. You know the\r\nreason you come to me is that youre frightened, scared, terrified. Well,\r\nstrangely enough, I'm not going to reject your munificence. I'll accept\r\nit, because to do God's work is more important than any personal pride\r\nof mine or any knowledge that one of the best things _Cynodon dactylon_\r\ncould do--if I do not take too much upon myself in judging a\r\nfellowcreature--would be to bury Albert Weener.\"\r\n\r\nI remained unmoved by her tirade. \"When you returned from Whitney you\r\ntold me there remained only details to be worked out. About how long do\r\nyou think it will be before you have a workable compound?\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into a laugh and took out her toothpick to point it at me. \"Go\r\nand put your penny in another slot if you want an answer to an idiot\r\nquestion like that. How long? A day, a month, a year, ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"In ten years--\" I began.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" she said and put away the toothpick.\r\n\r\n\r\n_83._ I phoned Stuart Thario to fly over right away for a conference.\r\n\"General,\" I began, \"we'll have to start looking ahead and making\r\nplans.\"\r\n\r\nHe hid his mustache with the side of his forefinger. \"Don't quite\r\nunderstand, Albert--have details here of activities ... next three\r\nyears ...\"\r\n\r\nI pressed the buzzer for my secretary. \"Bring General Thario some\r\nrefreshment,\" I ordered.\r\n\r\nThe command was not only familiar on the occasion of his visits, but\r\nevidently anticipated, for she appeared in a moment with a trayful of\r\nbottles.\r\n\r\n\"Bad habit of yours, Albert, teetotalism ... makes the brain cloudy ...\r\ninsidious.\" He took a long drink. \"Very little real bourbon left ...\r\nEuropean imitation vile ... learning to like Holland gin.\" He drank\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"To get back to the business of making plans, General,\" I urged gently.\r\n\r\n\"Not one of those people getting worried about the Grass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not worried. Just trying to look ahead. I can't afford to be caught\r\nnapping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said, \"can't pull another South American this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--and besides, I'm not concerned with money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Albert, don't tell me youve finally got enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not the time to be avaricious,\" I reproved him. \"If the Grass\r\ncontinues to spread--and there seems to be little doubt it will--\"\r\n\r\n\"All of New Zealand's North Island was finished this morning,\" he\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n\"I heard it myself; anyway, that's the point. As the Grass advances\r\nthere will be new hordes of refugees--\"\r\n\r\nHe was certainly in an impatient mood this morning, for he interrupted\r\nme again. \"New markets for concentrates,\" he suggested.\r\n\r\nI looked at him pityingly. Was the old man's mind slipping? I wondered\r\nif it would be necessary to replace him. \"General,\" I said gently, \"with\r\nrare exceptions these people will have nothing but worthless currency.\"\r\n\r\n\"Goods. Labor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen the previous batches of refugees foresighted enough to\r\nget out any goods of value before starting off? And as for labor, all\r\nour workers are now so heavily subsidized by the dole that to cut wages\r\nanother cent--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha'penny,\" corrected General Thario.\r\n\r\n\"Centime if you like. --would be merely to increase our taxes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said. \"I see I have been hasty. What did you have in\r\nmind, Albert?\"\r\n\r\n\"Retrenchment. Cut production; abandon the factories in the immediate\r\npath of the Grass. Fix on reasonably safe spots to store depots of the\r\nfinished concentrates, others for raw materials. Or perhaps they might\r\nbe combined.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the factories?\"\r\n\r\n\"Smaller,\" I said. \"Practically portable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum.\" He frowned. \"You do intend to do business on a small scale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Minute,\" I confirmed.\r\n\r\n\"What about the mines? The steelmills, the oilfields, the airplane and\r\nautomobile factories? The shipyards?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut them down,\" I ordered. \"Ruthlessly. Except maybe a few in\r\nEngland.\"\r\n\r\n\"The countries where theyre located will grab them.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isnt a government in existence who would dare touch anything\r\nbelonging to Consolidated Pemmican. If any should come into existence\r\nour individualistic friends would take care of the situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pay gangsters to overturn governments?\"\r\n\r\n\"They would hardly be legitimate governments. Anyway, a man has a right\r\nto protect his property.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert,\" he complained querulously, \"youre condemning civilization to\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"General,\" I said, \"youre talking like a wildeyed crackpot. A\r\nbusinessman's concern is with business; he leaves abstractions to\r\nvisionaries. Our plants will be closed down, because until the Grass is\r\nstopped they can make us no profit. Let some idealistic industrialist\r\ntake care of civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert, you know very well no business of any size can operate today\r\nwithout your active support. Think again, Albert; listen to me as a\r\nfriend; we have been associated a long time and to some extent you have\r\ntaken Joe's place in my mind. Consider the larger aspects. Suppose you\r\ndon't make a profit? Suppose you even take a loss. You can afford to do\r\nit for common humanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly think I do my share for common humanity, General Thario,\r\nand it cuts me to the heart that you of all people should imply such a\r\nsentimental and unjust reproach against me. You know as well as I do I\r\nhave given more than half my fortune to charitable works.\"\r\n\r\n\"Albert, Albert, need there be this hypocrisy between you and me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean. I only know I called you to evolve specific\r\nplans and you have embarked instead on windy platitudes and personal\r\ninsult.\"\r\n\r\nHe sat for a long time quietly, his drink untouched before him. I did\r\nnot disturb his meditation, but indulged in one on my own account,\r\nthinking of all I had done for him and his family. But only a foolish\r\nman expects gratitude, or for that matter any reward at all for his\r\nkindnesses.\r\n\r\nAt last he broke his silence, speaking slowly, almost painfully. \"I\r\nhave not had what could be called a successful life, even though today I\r\nam a wealthy man.\" He resumed his drink again and I wondered what this\r\nremark had to do with the subject in hand. Perhaps nothing, I thought;\r\nhe is just rambling along while he reconciles himself to the situation.\r\nI was glad he was going to be sensible afterall. Not that it mattered; I\r\ncould get many able lieutenants, but for oldtime's sake I was pleased at\r\nthe abandonment of his recalcitrance. He relaxed further into the chair\r\nwhile I waited to resume the practical discussion.\r\n\r\n\"When you first came to me in Washington, Albert, seeking warcontracts\r\nfor your microscopic business, I suppose there was even then a mark upon\r\nyour forehead, but I was too heavy with the guilt of my own affairs to\r\nsee it. We all have our price, Albert, sometimes it is another star on\r\nthe shoulderstraps or a peerage or wealth or the apparent safety of a\r\nson....\r\n\r\n\"I have come a long way with you since then, Albert, through shady deals\r\nand brilliant coups and dark passages which would not bear too much\r\ninvestigation. I'm afraid I cannot go any further with you. You will\r\nhave to get someone else to kill civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you choose, General Thario,\" I agreed stiffly.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, I'm not finished. I have always tried, however inadequately, to\r\ndo my duty. Articles of War ... holding commission in the Armies of the\r\nUnited States....\" Emotion seemed to be sobering him rapidly. \"Duty to\r\nyou ... Consolidated Pemmican ... resign commission. Must mention spot\r\n... try Sahara....\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, General Thario,\" I said. \"I shall certainly consider the\r\nSahara as location for depots.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't change your mind about this whole thing, Albert?\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. How could I fly in the face of commonsense to gratify\r\nthe silly whim of an old man whose intelligence was clearly not what it\r\nhad once been?\r\n\r\n\"I was afraid not,\" he muttered, \"afraid not. I don't blame you,\r\nAlbert. Men are as God created them ... or environment, as the socialist\r\nfellers say ... you didnt put the mark on your forehead ... Not\r\nsuccessful ... Joe (I called him George but he was Joe all the time)\r\nwanted to go to West Point afterall ... First Symphony in the fire ...\r\n_I_ burned Joe's First Symphony ... Do you understand me, Albert? Though\r\nI refuse, I am still guilty ... Cannibal Thario, they said ... Chronos\r\nwould be better ... classical allusion escapes the enlistedman....\"\r\n\r\nHe walked out, still mumbling inarticulately and I sat there saddened\r\nthat a man once alert and vigorous as the general should have come at\r\nlast to senility and an enfeebled mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_84._ The defection of General Thario threw a great burden of work upon\r\nmy shoulders. Preblesham was able enough in his own sphere, but his\r\nvision was not sufficiently broad to operate at the highest levels. The\r\nprocess of closing down our plants was more complicated than had been\r\nanticipated and Thario's military mind would have been more useful than\r\nPreblesham's theological one. The employees, conceiving through some\r\nfantastic logic that their jobs were as much their property as the mills\r\nor mines or factorybuildings were mine, rioted and had to be\r\npacified--the first time such a tactic was resorted to in years. In some\r\nplaces these misguided men actually took possession of the places where\r\nthey worked and tried to operate them, but of course they were balked by\r\ntheir own inefficiency. Human nature being what it is, they tried to\r\nblame their helplessness on my control of their sources of raw material\r\nand their consequent inability to obtain vital supplies; as well as the\r\ncutting off of light and power from the seized plants, but this was mere\r\nbuckpassing, always noticeable when some radical scheme fails.\r\n\r\nBut the setting up of depots in the Sahara, as General Thario had\r\nsuggested, and by extension, in Arabia, was a different matter. Here\r\nPreblesham's genius shone. He flew our whole Australian store of raw\r\nmaterials out without a loss. He recruited gangs of Chinese coolies\r\nwith an efficiency which would have put an oldtime blackbirder to shame.\r\nHe argued, cajoled, bullied, sweated for twentyfour hours a day and when\r\nin six months he had completed his task, we had seven depots, two in\r\nArabia and five in Africa, complete with four factories, with enough\r\nconcentrates on hand to feed the world for a year--if the world had the\r\nmeans to pay, which it didnt--and to operate for five.\r\n\r\nDuring those six months the Grass ravenously snatched morsel after\r\nmorsel. New Zealand's South Island, New Caledonia, the Solomons and the\r\nMarianas were gobbled at the same moment. It gorged on New Guinea and\r\nsearched out the minor islands of the East Indies as a cat searches for\r\nbaby fieldmice in a nest her paw has discovered. It took a bite of the\r\nQueensland coast just below the Great Barrier Reef. The next day it was\r\nreported near Townsville and soon after on the Cape York peninsula, the\r\nAustralian finger pointing upward to islands where lived little black\r\nmen with woolly hair.\r\n\r\nThe people of Melbourne and Sydney and Brisbane took the coming of the\r\nGrass with calm anger. Preparations for removal had been made months\r\nbefore and this migration was distinguished from previous ones by its\r\norder and completeness. But although they moved calmly in accordance\r\nwith clear plans their anger was directed against all those in authority\r\nwho had failed to take measures to protect their beloved land.\r\n\r\nQueensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania went. The Grass swept\r\nsouthward like a sickle, cutting through South Australia and biting deep\r\nwith its point into Western. Although we were amply provided with raw\r\nmaterial, considering the curtailment of our activities, Preblesham, on\r\nthe spot, could not resist buying up great herds of sheep for a penny on\r\nthe pound and having them driven northward in the hope of finding\r\nsomehow a means to ship them. I am sorry to say--though I'm afraid I\r\ncould have predicted it--this venture was a total loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_85._ Burlet, unfolding the _Times_ on my breakfastplate, coughed\r\nrespectfully. \"If I could speak to you at your convenience, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Burlet? Lord Arpers finally come through with a higher\r\noffer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir. I consider the question of service closed as long as\r\nyou find yourself satisfied, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite satisfied, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ad in mind the discussion of quite another matter, sir. Not relating\r\nto domestic issues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Burlet. Come into the library after breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir.\"\r\n\r\nWith a world of problems on my mind I thought it would be wryly amusing\r\nto resolve whatever difficulties troubled my butler. Promptly after I\r\nhad settled myself at my desk and before I rang for my secretary, Burlet\r\nappeared in the doorway, his striped vest smoothed down over his rounded\r\nabdomen, every thin hair in place over the dome of his balding head.\r\n\r\n\"Come in, Burlet. Sit down. What's on your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\" To my surprise he accepted my invitation and seated\r\nhimself opposite me. \"I ave been speculating, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Burlet? Silly thing to do. Lost all your wages, I suppose, and\r\nwould like an advance?\"\r\n\r\n\"You misappre--end me, sir. Not speculating on Change. Speculating on\r\nthe Grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. And did you arrive at any conclusion, Burlet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I ave, sir. As I understand it, scientists and statesmen are\r\nexerting their energies to fight the Grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right.\" I was beginning to be bored. Had the butler fallen prey\r\nto one of the graminophile sects like Brother Paul's and gone through\r\nall this rigmarole merely to give me notice previous to immolating\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\n\"And so far they ave achieved no success?\"\r\n\r\n\"Obviously, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, sir, would it not be a sensible precaution to find some\r\nmeans of refuge until and if they find a way to kill the Grass?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no 'if,' Burlet. The means will be found, and shortly--of that\r\nI am sure. As for temporary refuge until that time, no doubt it would be\r\nexcellent, if practicable. What do you propose--emigration to Mars or\r\nfloating islands in the oceans?\" Both of these expedients had long ago\r\nbeen put forth by contestants in the _Intelligencer_.\r\n\r\n\"Journeys to other planets would not solve things, sir. Assuming the\r\nconstruction of a vessel--an assumption so far unwarranted, if I may say\r\nso, sir--it would accommodate but a fraction of the affected\r\npopulations. As for floating islands, they would be no more immune to\r\nairborne seeds than stationary ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was discovered long ago, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, sir. Then, if I may say so, protection must be afforded on\r\nthe spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you propose to do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, by the building of vertical cities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vertical cities?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I believe sites should be selected near bodies of fresh water\r\nand tremendous excavations made. The walls and floor of the excavations\r\nshould be lined with concrete, through which the water is piped. The\r\ncities could be on many levels, the topmost peraps several miles in the\r\nair--glass enclosed--and with pipes reaching still igher to bring air\r\nin, and completely tight against the Grass. They should be\r\nselfcontained, generating their own power and providing their food by\r\nydroponic farming. Such cities could hold millions of people now doomed\r\nuntil a way is found to kill the Grass.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a faintly familiar ring to the scheme.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have worked it out thoroughly, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Polishing the plate, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Polishing the plate?\"\r\n\r\n\"It leaves the mind free for cerebration. I ave a full set of blueprints\r\nand specifications, if youd like to inspect them, sir.\"\r\n\r\nIt was fantastic, I thought, and probably quite impractical, but I\r\npromised to submit his plans to those with more technical knowledge than\r\nI possessed. I sent his carefully written papers to an undersecretary of\r\nthe World Congress and forgot the matter. Idleness certainly led to\r\nqueer occupations. Vertical cities--and who in the world had the money\r\nto erect these nightmare structures? Only Albert Weener--that was\r\nprobably why Burlet took advantage of his position to approach me with\r\nthe scheme. Completely absurd....\r\n\r\n\r\n_86._ Probably the complaints of the Australians gave final impetus to\r\nthe Congress to Combat the Grass. They met in extraordinary session in\r\nBudapest and declared themselves the executive body of a world\r\ngovernment, which did not of course include the Socialist Union. All\r\nqualified scientists were immediately ordered to leave whatever\r\nemployment they had and place themselves at the disposition of the World\r\nGovernment. Affluence for life, guaranteed against any fluctuations of\r\ncurrency, was promised to anyone who could offer, not necessarily an\r\nanswer, but an idea which should lead to the solution of the problem in\r\nhand. While they were issuing their first edicts the Grass finished off\r\nthe East Indies, covered threequarters of Australia and attacked the\r\nsouthern Philippines.\r\n\r\nMillions of Indonesians traveling the comparatively short distances in\r\nanything floatable crowded the already overpopulated areas of Asia. As I\r\nhad predicted to General Thario, these refugees carried nothing with\r\nwhich to purchase the concentrates to keep them alive, and conditions of\r\nfamine in India and China, essentially due to the backwardness of these\r\ncountries, offered no subsistence to the natives--much less to an influx\r\nfrom outside.\r\n\r\nThe Grass sped northward and westward through the Malay States and Siam,\r\nup into China and Burma. In the beginning the Orientals did not flee,\r\nbut stood their ground, village by village and family by family,\r\nopposing the advance with scythes, stones, and pitiful bonfires of their\r\nhousehold belongings, with hoes, flails, and finally with their bare\r\nhands. But the naked hand, no matter how often multiplied, was as unable\r\nto halt the green flow as the most uptodate weapons of modern science.\r\nAnd the Chinese and the Hindus dying at their posts were no more an\r\nobstacle than mountain or desert or stretches of empty sea had been.\r\n\r\nIt was now deemed expedient, in order to keep public hysteria from\r\nrising to new selfdestructive heights, to tone down and modify the news.\r\nThis proved quite difficult at first, for the people in their\r\nshortsightedness clamored for the accounts of impending doom which they\r\ndevoured with a dreadful fascination. But eventually, when the wildest\r\nrumors produced by the dearth of accurate reports were disproved, many\r\nof the people in Western Europe and Africa actually believed the Grass\r\nhad somehow failed to make headway on the Asiatic continent and would\r\nhave remained in their pleasant ignorance had it not been for the\r\npremature flight of masses of Asiatics.\r\n\r\nFor the phenomenon contemporary with the close of the Roman Empire was\r\nrepeated. A great, struggling, churning, sprawling, desperate efflux\r\nfrom east to west began; once more the Golden Horde was on the march.\r\nThey did not come, as had their ancestors, on wildly charging horses,\r\nthreatening with lances and deadly scimitars, but on foot, wretched and\r\nbegging. Even had I been as maudlin as Stuart Thario desired I could not\r\nhave fed these people, for there were no longer railroads with\r\nrollingstock adequate to carry the freight, no fleets of trucks in good\r\nrepair, nor was the fuel available had they existed. The world receded\r\nrapidly from the machineage, and as it did so famine and pestilence\r\nincreased in evermounting spirals.\r\n\r\nThe mob of refugees might be likened to a beast with weak, almost\r\natrophied legs, but with a great mouth and greater stomach. It moved\r\nwith painful slowness, crawling over the face of southern Asia, finding\r\nlittle sustenance as it came, leaving none whatever after it left. The\r\nbeast, only dimly aware of the Grass it was fleeing from, could\r\nformulate no thoughts of the refuge it sought. Without plan, hope, or\r\nmalice, it was concerned only with hunger. Day and night its empty gut\r\ncried for food.\r\n\r\nThe starving men and women--the children died quickly--ate first all\r\nthat was available in the stores and homes, then scrabbled in the fields\r\nfor a forgotten grain of rice or wheat; they ate the bark and fungus\r\nfrom the trees and gleaned the pastures of their weeds and dung. As they\r\nate they moved on, their faminedistended stomachs craving more to eat,\r\ndriving the ones who were but one step further from starvation ever\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nLong ago they had chewed on the leather of their footgear and devoured\r\nall cats, dogs and rodents. They ate the stiffened and putrid carcasses\r\nof draft animals which had been pushed to the last extremity; they\r\nturned upon the corpses of the newly dead and fed on them, and at length\r\ndid not wait for death from hunger to make a new cadaver, but mercifully\r\nslew the weak and ate the still warm bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic influx was a social accordion. The pulledout end, the high\r\nnotes, as it were, the Indian princes, Chinese warlords, arrived quickly\r\nand settled into a welcoming obscurity. They came by plane, with gold\r\nand jewels and government bonds and shares of Consolidated Pemmican. The\r\nmiddle creases of the accordion came later, more slowly, but as quickly\r\nas money could speed their way. Men of wealth when they began their\r\njourney, they arrived little more than penniless and were looked upon\r\nwith suspicion, tolerated only so long as they did not become a public\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThe low notes, the thick and heavy pleats, took not days nor weeks nor\r\nmonths, but years to make the trek. They kept but a step ahead of the\r\nGrass, traveling at the same pace. They came not alone, but with\r\naccretions, pushing ahead of them millions of their same dispossessed,\r\nhungry, penniless kind. These were not greeted with suspicion, but with\r\nhatred; machineguns were turned upon the advancing mobs, the few\r\nairplanes in service were commandeered to bomb them, and only lack of\r\nfuel and explosives allowed them to sweep into Europe and overwhelm\r\nmost of it as the barbarians had overwhelmed Rome.\r\n\r\nBut I anticipate. While the bulk of the Orientals was still beyond the\r\nHimalayas and the Gobi, Europe indulged in a wild saturnalia to\r\ncelebrate its own doom. All pretense of sexual morality vanished. Men\r\nand women coupled openly upon the streets. The small illprinted\r\nnewspapers carried advertisements promising the gratification of strange\r\nlusts. A new cult of Priapus sprang up and virgins were ceremoniously\r\ndeflowered at his shrine. Those beyond the age of concupiscence attended\r\ncelebrations of the Black Mass, although I was told by one communicant\r\nthat participation lacked the necessary zest, since none possessed a\r\nfaith to which blasphemy could give a shocking thrill.\r\n\r\nMurder was indulged in purely for the pleasure. Men and women, hearing\r\nof the cannibalism raging among the refugees, adopted and refined it for\r\ntheir own amusement. Small promiscuous groups, at the end of orgies,\r\nchose the man and woman tiring soonest; the two victims were thereupon\r\nkilled and devoured by their late paramours.\r\n\r\nAs there was a cult to Priapus, so there was an equally strong cult to\r\nDiana. The monasteries and convents overflowed. But in the tension of\r\nthe moment many were not satisfied with mere vows of celibacy. In secret\r\nand impressive ceremonies women scarified their tenderest parts with\r\nredhot irons, thus proving themselves forever beyond the lusts of the\r\nflesh; men solemnly castrated themselves and threw the symbols of their\r\nmanhood into a consuming fire.\r\n\r\nI wouldnt want to give the impression bestial madness of one kind or\r\nanother overtook everyone. There were plenty of normal people like\r\nmyself who were able to maintain their selfcontrol and canalize those\r\nenergies promoting crimes and beastly exhibitions in the unrestrained\r\ninto looking forward to the day when the Grass would be gone and sanity\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nNor would I like anyone to think law and order had completely abdicated\r\nits function. As offenses multiplied, laws grew more severe,\r\nmisdemeanors became felonies, felonies capital offenses. When death by\r\nhanging became the prescribed sentence for any type of theft it was\r\nnecessary to make the punishment for murder more drastic. Drawing and\r\nquartering were reinstituted; this not proving an efficient deterrent,\r\nmany jurists advocated a return to the Roman practice of spreadeagling a\r\nman to death; but the churches vigorously objected to this suggestion as\r\nblasphemous, believing the ordinary sight of crucified murderers would\r\ntend to debase the central symbol of Christianity. A less common Roman\r\nusage was adopted in its stead, that of being torn by hungry dogs, and\r\nto this the Christians did not object.\r\n\r\nBut the utmost severity of local and national officials, even when\r\nbacked by the might of World Government, could not cope with the waves\r\nof migrants from the East nor the heedlessness of law they brought with\r\nthem. As the Grass pushed the Indians and Chinese westward, they in turn\r\nsent the Mongols, the Afghans and the Persians ahead of them. These\r\nnaturally warlike peoples were displaced, not by force of arms, but by\r\nsheer weight of numbers; and so, doubly overcome by being dispossessed\r\nof their homes--and by pacifists at that--they vented their pique upon\r\nthose to the west.\r\n\r\nAs the starving and destitute trickled into Europe and North Africa,\r\ngiving a hint of the flood to follow, I congratulated myself on the\r\nforesight which led to our retrenchment, for I know these ravening\r\nhordes would have devoured the property of Consolidated Pemmican with as\r\nlittle respect as they did the scant store of Ah Que, Ram Singh or\r\nMohammed Ali. My chief concern was now to keep my industrial and\r\norganizational machinery intact against the day when a stable market\r\ncould again be established. To this end I kept our vast staff of\r\nresearchworkers--exempt from the draft of the World Government which had\r\nbeen quite reasonable in the matter--constantly busy, for every day's\r\ndelay in the arresting of the Grass meant a dead loss of profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_87._ Josephine Francis alone, and as always, proved completely\r\nuncooperative. Undoubtedly much of her stubbornness was due to her sex;\r\nthe residue, to her unorthodox approach to the mysteries of science.\r\nWhen I prodded her for results she snarled she was not a slotmachine.\r\nWhen I pointed out tactfully that only my money made possible the\r\ncontinuation of her efforts, she told me rudely to seek the Wailing Wall\r\nin Jerusalem before it was covered by the Grass. Again and again I urged\r\nher to give me some idea how long it would be before she could produce a\r\nchemical even for experimental use against the Grass and each time she\r\nturned me aside with insult or rude jest.\r\n\r\nI had set her up in--or rather, to be more accurate, she had insisted\r\nupon--a completely equipped and isolated laboratory in Surrey. As it was\r\nconvenient to my Hampshire place I dropped in almost daily upon her; but\r\nI cannot say my visits perceptibly quickened her lethargy.\r\n\r\n\"Worried, Weener?\" she asked me, absently putting down a coffeepot on a\r\nstack of microscope slides. \"_Cynodon dactylon_'ll eat gold and\r\nbanknotes, drillpresses and openhearths as readily as quartz and mica,\r\ndead bodies and abandoned household goods.\"\r\n\r\nI couldnt resist the opening. \"Anything in fact,\" I pointed out, \"except\r\nsalt.\"\r\n\r\n\"A Daniel!\" she exclaimed. \"A Daniel come to judgment. Oh, Weener, thou\r\nshouldst have been born a chemist. And what is the other mistake? Give\r\nme leave to throw away my retorts and testtubes and bunsen burners by\r\nrevealing the other element besides sodium _Cynodon dactylon_ refuses.\r\nFor every mistake there is another mistake which supplements it. Sodium\r\nwas the blindspot in the Metamorphizer; when I find the balancing\r\nblindspot I shall know not only the second element which the Grass\r\ncannot absorb but one which will be poison to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a chemist, Miss Francis,\" I said, \"but it seems to me Ive heard\r\nthere are a limited number of elements.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are. And three states for each element. And an infinite number of\r\nconditions governing their application. What's the matter--arent your\r\ntrained seals performing?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the research laboratories of Consolidated Pemmican are going night\r\nand day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what the devil are you hounding me for? Let them find the\r\ncounteragent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two heads are better than one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. Two blockheads are worse than one insofar as they tend to\r\nregard each other as a source of wisdom. I shall conquer the Grass, I\r\nalone, I, Josephine Spencer Francis--and as soon as possible. Now you\r\nhave all the data in its most specific form. And I shall accomplish this\r\nbecause I must and not because I love Albert Weener or care a\r\nlitmuspaper whether or not his offal is swallowed up. I have done what I\r\nhave done (God forgive me) and I shall undo it, but the matter is\r\nbetween me and a Larger Accountant than the clerk who signs your monthly\r\nchecks.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think about temporary protective measures in the\r\nmeanwhile?\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you mean, Weener? 'Temporary protective measures'?\r\nWhat euphuistic gibberish is this?\"\r\n\r\nI outlined briefly my butler's plan of vertical cities. Miss Francis\r\nstartled me with a laugh resembling the burst of machinegun fire.\r\n\"Someone's been pulling your leg, poor terrified Maecenas. Or else youre\r\nbefuddled with too many _Thrilling Wonder Scientifictions_. Pipes into\r\nthe stratosphere! Watersupply piped in through concrete walls! Doesnt\r\nyour mad inventor know the seeds would find these apertures in an\r\ninstant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, those are possibly minor flaws which could be remedied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go and remedy them and leave me to my work. Or pin your faith on\r\nsubstantialities instead of flights of fancy.\"\r\n\r\nI went up to London, my mind full of a thousand problems. I had caught\r\nthe economical British habit of using the trains, conserving the petrol\r\nand tyres on my car. The first thing I saw on the Marylebone platform\r\nwas the crude picture in green chalk of a stolon of _Cynodon dactylon_.\r\nWhat idiot, I thought as I irritably rubbed at it with the sole of my\r\nshoe, what feebleminded creature has been let loose to do a thing like\r\nthis? The brittle chalk smeared beneath my foot, but the representation\r\nremained, almost recognizable. On my way to the Savoy I saw it again,\r\ndefacing a hoarding, and as I paid off my driver I thought I caught\r\nanother glimpse of the nonsensical drawing on the side of a lorry going\r\nby.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my sensitivity perceived these signs before they were common\r\nproperty, but in a few days they were spread all over Europe, through\r\nwhat insane impulse I do not know. For whatever reason, symbols of the\r\nGrass blossomed on the Arc de Triomphe, on the Brandenburger Tor, on the\r\npavement of the Ringstrasse and on the bridges spanning the Danube\r\nbetween Buda and Pesth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_88._ I find myself, in retrospect, involuntarily telescoping the time\r\nof events. Looking backward, years become days, and months minutes. At\r\nthe time I saw the first reproductions of the Grass in London the thing\r\nitself was continents away, busy absorbing the fringes of Asia. But its\r\nheralds and victims went before it, changing the life of man as it had\r\nitself changed the face of the world.\r\n\r\nThe breakdown of civilization beyond the Channel was almost complete.\r\nOnly Consolidated Pemmican and the World Government still maintained\r\ncommunication facilities; and with the blocking of the normal ways of\r\ncommerce the World Government found it difficult to spread either news\r\nor decrees to the general public. The most fantastic and contradictory\r\nideas about the Grass were held by the masses.\r\n\r\nWhen the Grass was in the Deccan and still well below the Yangtze, the\r\nAthenians were thrown into panic by the rumor it had appeared in\r\nSalonika. At the same time there was wild rejoicing in the streets of\r\nMarseilles based on the belief large stretches of North America had\r\nbecome miraculously free. The cult of the Grass idolaters flourished\r\ndespite the strictest interdictions and great massmeetings were\r\nfrequently held during which the worshipers turned their faces toward\r\nthe southeast and prayed fervently for speedy immolation. It was quite\r\nuseless for the World Government to attempt to spread the actual facts;\r\nthe earlier censorship together with a public temper that preferred to\r\nbelieve the extremes of good or bad rather than the truth of gradual yet\r\nrelentless approach, made people heedless of broadcasts rarely received\r\neven by state operated publicaddress systems or of handbills which even\r\nthe still literate could not bother to decipher.\r\n\r\nThe idealization of the Socialist Union--once the Soviet Union--which\r\nhad risen and fallen through the years, was quickened among those not\r\nenamored of the Grass. There must be some intrinsic virtue in this land\r\nwhich had not only been immune to inoculation by the Metamorphizer, but\r\nkept the encroaching weed from invading its borders in spite of its long\r\ncontinued proximity across Bering Strait and the Aleutians. The Grass\r\nhad jumped gaps thousands of ocean miles and yet it had not bridged that\r\nnarrow strip of water. It would have been a shock to these people had\r\nthey known, as I knew and as the World Government had vainly tried to\r\ntell them, what Moscow had recently and reluctantly admitted: the Grass\r\nhad long since crossed into Siberia and was now working its will from\r\nKamchatka to the Lena River.\r\n\r\nThe people of Japan, caught between the jaws of a closing vise,\r\nresponded in a manner peculiar to themselves. The Christians, now\r\nforming a majority, declared the Grass a punishment for the sins of the\r\nworld and hoped, by their steadfastness in the face of certain death, to\r\nearn a national martyr's crown and thus perhaps redeem those still\r\nbenighted. The Shintoists, on the other hand, agreed the Grass was a\r\npunishment--but for a different crime. Had the doctrine of the Eight\r\nCorners of the World never been abandoned the Japanese would never have\r\npermitted the Grass to overwhelm the Yamato race. The new emperor's\r\nreign name, Saiji, they argued, ought not to mean rule by the people as\r\nit was usually interpreted, but rule of the people and they called for\r\nan immediate Saiji Restoration, under which the subjects of the Mikado\r\nwould welcome death on the battlefield in a manner compatible with\r\nbushido, thus redeeming previous aberrations for which they were now\r\nbeing chastised. Both parties agreed that under no circumstances would\r\nany Japanese demean himself by leaving Nippon and the world was\r\ntherefore spared an additional influx from these islands.\r\n\r\nBut the Japanese were the only ones who refused to join the westward\r\nstampede plunging the world daily deeper into barbarism. We in England\r\nhad cause to congratulate ourselves on our unique position. The Channel\r\nmight have been a thousand miles wide instead of twenty. The turmoil of\r\nthe Continent and of Africa was but dimly reflected. There was still a\r\nskeletal vestige of trade, the dole kept the lazy from starvation,\r\nrailways still functioned on greatly reduced schedules, and the wireless\r\ncontinued to operate from, \"Good morning, everybody, this is London,\" to\r\nthe last strains of _God Save the Queen_. Although I was constantly\r\nrasped by inactivity and by the slowness of the researchworkers to find\r\na weapon against the Grass, I was happy to be able to wait out this\r\nterrible period in so ameliorative a spot.\r\n\r\nTrue, our depots in the Arabian and Sahara deserts were unthreatened by\r\neither the Grass or the horde, but I should have found it uncomfortable\r\nindeed to have lived in either place. In Hampshire or London I felt\r\nmyself the center of what was left of the world, ready to jump into\r\naction the moment the great discovery was finally made and the Grass\r\nbegan to recede.\r\n\r\nPreblesham, my right hand, flew weekly to Africa and Asia Minor, weeding\r\nout those workers who threatened to become useless to us because of\r\ntheir reaction to the isolated and monotonous conditions at the depots;\r\nkeeping the heavily armed guards about our closed continental properties\r\nalert and seeing our curtailed activities in Great Britain were\r\njudiciously profitable. This period of quiescence suited his talents\r\nperfectly, for it required of him little imagination, but great industry\r\nand force.\r\n\r\nI had noticed for some time a slight air of preoccupation and constraint\r\nin his demeanor during his reports to me, but I put it down to his\r\nengrossment with our affairs and resolved to make him take an extended\r\nvacation as soon as he could be spared, never dreaming of disloyalty\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nI was shocked, then, and deeply wounded when at the close of one of our\r\nconferences he announced, \"Mr Weener, I'm leaving you.\"\r\n\r\nI begged him to tell me what was wrong, what had caused him to come to\r\nthis decision. I knew, I said, that he was overworked and offered him\r\nthe badly needed vacation. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"It aint that. Overwork! I don't believe there is such a thing. At least\r\nIve never suffered from it. No, Mr Weener, my trouble is something no\r\namount of vacations can help, because I can't get away from a Voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Voice, Tony?\" Hallucinations were certainly a symptom of overwork. I\r\nbegan mentally recalling names of prominent psychiatrists.\r\n\r\n\"A Voice within,\" he repeated firmly. \"I am a sinful man, a miserable\r\nbackslider. Maybe Brother Paul was not treading a true path; I doubt if\r\nhe was or I would not have been led aside from following him so easily;\r\nbut when I was doing his work I was at least trying to do the will of\r\nGod and not the will of another man no better--spiritually, you\r\nunderstand, Mr Weener, spiritually--than myself.\r\n\r\n\"But now His Voice has sought me out again and I must once more take up\r\nthe cross. I feel a call to go on a mission to the poor heathens and\r\nurge on them submission to their Father's rod.\"\r\n\r\n\"Among those savages across the Channel! They will tear you limb from\r\nlimb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Christ will make me whole again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tony, you are not yourself. Youre upset.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not myself, Mr Weener, I have become as a little child again and\r\ndo my Father's bidding. I am upset, yes, turned upsidedown and insideout\r\nby a Force not content to leave men in wrong attitudes or sinful\r\nstates. But upset, I stand upright and go about my Father's business.\r\nGod bless you, Mr Weener.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Francis and Preblesham, at opposite ends of the intellectual scale,\r\nboth maundering on about doing the Will of God and General Thario\r\ntalking about marks on foreheads--what sort of feebleminded,\r\nretrogressive world was I living in? All the outworn superstitions of\r\nreligion taking hold of people and intruding themselves into otherwise\r\nnormal conversation. A wave of madness, akin to the plague of the Grass,\r\nmust be sweeping over the earth, was my conclusion.\r\n\r\nIf General Thario's desertion had thrown an extra weight on my\r\nshoulders, Preblesham's burdened me with all the petty details of\r\nroutine. It was now I who had to inspect our depots periodically and\r\nmake constant trips into the dangerous regions across the Channel to see\r\nthat the shutdown plants were being properly cared for. I resented\r\nbitterly the trick of fate preventing me from finding for any length of\r\ntime subordinates to whom I could delegate authority.\r\n\r\nNor even on whom I could rely. What were Miss Francis and her wellpaid\r\nstaff doing all this time? Why had they produced nothing in return for\r\nthe fat living they got from me? The Grass was halfway across Asia,\r\nlapping the High Pamirs from the south and from the north, digesting\r\nKorea, Manchuria, Mongolia, thrusting runners into Turkestan--and still\r\nno progress made against it. It would be a matter of mere months now\r\nuntil our Arabian depots would be in the danger zone. I could only\r\nconclude these socalled scientists were little better than fakers,\r\ncompletely incompetent when confronted by emergency.\r\n\r\nThey were ready enough to announce useless and inapplicable discoveries\r\nand conclusions; byproducts of their research, they called them, with an\r\nobviously selfconscious attempt to speak the language of industry. The\r\ninsects living in and below the Grass were growing ever larger and more\r\nnumerous. Expeditions had found worms the size of snakes and bugs big as\r\nbirds, happy in their environment. The oceans, they announced, were\r\ndrying up, due to the retention of moisture in the soil by the Grass,\r\nand added complacently that in a million years or so, assuming the Grass\r\nin the meantime covered the earth, there would be no bodies of water\r\nleft. Climates were equalizing themselves, the polar icecaps were\r\nmelting and spots previously too cold for _Cynodon dactylon_ were now\r\ncovered. I felt it to be a clear case of embezzlement that they had used\r\nmy money, paid for a specific purpose, to make these useless, if\r\npossibly interesting, deductions.\r\n\r\nFor while they dawdled and read learned papers to each other, the Grass\r\ntouched the Persian Gulf and the Caspian, paused before Lake Balkash and\r\nreached the Yenisei at the Arctic Circle. Far to the south it jumped\r\nfrom India to the Maldives, from the Maldives to the Seychelles and from\r\nthe Seychelles on to the great island of Madagascar. I hammered the\r\ntheme of \"Time, time\" at Miss Francis, but her only response was a\r\nhelpless sneer at my impatience.\r\n\r\nAt intervals Burlet inquired of me what progress was being made with his\r\nplan for cities of refuge. I could only answer him truthfully that as\r\nfar as I knew the World Government had it under consideration.\r\n\r\n\"But--if you will excuse my saying so, sir--in the meantime those people\r\nare dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so, Burlet, but there is nothing you or I can do about it.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time since he entered my service I caught him looking\r\nalmost impertinently at me. I faced him back and he dropped his eyes.\r\n\"Very good, sir. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nHe had made an understatement when he talked about \"those people\" dying.\r\nEurope was a madhouse. In selfdefense all strangers were instantly put\r\nto death and in retaliation the invading throngs spared no native.\r\nPeasants feared to stay their ground in terror of the oncoming Orientals\r\nand equally dared not move westward where certain killing awaited them\r\nat the hands of those who yesterday had been their neighbors. In an\r\neffort to cling to life they formed small bands and fought impartially\r\nboth the static and dynamic forces. Farming was practically abandoned\r\nand the swollen population lived entirely on wild growth or upon human\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\nIn Africa the situation was little better. Internecine wars and slavery\r\nmade their reappearance; the South African whites mercilessly\r\nslaughtered the blacks against a possible uprising and the Kaffirs,\r\nfleeing northward, repeated the European pattern of overcrowding, famine\r\nand pestilence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_89._ The day our Arabian depots were abandoned before the oncoming\r\nGrass I felt my heart would nearly break with anguish. All that labor,\r\nall that forethought, all those precious goods gone. And all because\r\nMiss Francis and those like her were too lazy or incompetent to do the\r\nwork for which they were paid. I flew to the spot, trying vainly to\r\nsalvage something, but lack of planes and fuel made it impossible.\r\nDuring this trip I caught my first sight of the Grass for years.\r\n\r\nI suppose no human eye sees anything abstractly, but only in relation to\r\nother things known and observed. With more than half the world in its\r\ngrip, the towering wave of green bore no more resemblance to its\r\nCalifornia prototype than a brontosaurus to the harmless lizard\r\nscuttling over the sunny floor of an outhouse. Between the dirtysugar\r\nsands of the desert and the oleograph sky it was a third band of\r\nbrilliant color, monstrously outofplace. A tidalwave would have seemed\r\nless alien and awful.\r\n\r\nThe distance was great enough so that no individual part stood out\r\ndistinctly; instead, it presented itself as a flat belt of green,\r\nmenacing and obdurate. As my plane rose I looked back at it stretching\r\nnorthward, southward and eastward to the horizon, a new invader in a\r\nland weary of many invaders; and I thought of the dead civilizations it\r\ncovered: Bactria, Parthia, Babylon; the Empire of Lame Timur, Cathay,\r\nCambodia, and the dominions of the Great Mogul.\r\n\r\nThe refuge of mankind narrowed continually, an island diminished daily\r\nby a lapping surf. Africa was thrice beset, in the south from\r\nMadagascar; in the center from the steppingstones in the Indian Ocean,\r\nand across the Red Sea where the Grass sucked renewed life from the\r\nsteaming jungles and grew with unbelievable rapidity; in the highlands\r\nof Rhodesia and Abyssinia it crept slowly over the plateaus toward the\r\nslopes of Kilimanjaro and the Drakensberg. Unless something were done\r\nquickly our Sahara depots would go the way of the Arabian ones and we\r\nwould be left with only our limited British facilities until the day\r\nwhen Africa and Asia would be reconquered.\r\n\r\nThe violence and murder which had gone before were tame compared with\r\nthe new fury that shook the feartortured people of Europe, helpless in\r\nthe nightmareridden days, dreaming through twitching nights of an escape\r\ngeographically nonexistent. Dismembered corpses in the streets, arenas\r\npacked with dead bodies, fallow fields newly fertilized with human blood\r\nadded their stench to that of an unwashed, disease riddled continent. A\r\nrumor was circulated that there were still Jews alive and those who but\r\nyesterday had sought each other in mortal combat now happily united to\r\nhunt down a common prey. And sure enough, in miserable caverns and\r\ncellars hitherto overlooked, shunning daylight, a few men in skullcaps\r\nand prayingshawls were found, dragged out into the disinterested\r\nsunlight with their families and exterminated. It was at this time the\r\nGrass crossed the Urals and leaped the Atlantic into Iceland.\r\n\r\nIn England, George Bernard Shaw, whose reported death some years before\r\nhad been mourned by those who had never read a word of his, rose\r\napparently from the grave to deliver himself of a last message:\r\n\r\n    \"If any who wept over my senile and useless carcass had taken the\r\n    trouble to read _Back to Methuselah_, they could have reassured\r\n    themselves regarding my premature demise. If ever there was to be a\r\n    Longliver, that Longliver would have to be me. This was determined\r\n    by the Life Force in the middle of the XIX Century. That Life Force\r\n    could not afford to rob a squinting world of a man of perfect\r\n    vision.\r\n\r\n    \"Like Haslam (I forget his first name--see my complete works if\r\n    you're interested) I gave myself out as dead in order to avoid the\r\n    gawking of a curious and idle multitude. I was recuperating from the\r\n    labors of my first century in order to throw myself into the more\r\n    arduous ones of the second.\r\n\r\n    \"But as I have pointed out so many times, the race was between\r\n    maturity and the petulant self-destruction of protracted\r\n    adolescence. Mankind had either to take thought or to perish, and it\r\n    has chosen (perhaps sensibly after all) to perish. I am too old now\r\n    to protest against selfindulgence.\r\n\r\n    \"Is it too late? Is it still possible to survive? The ship is now\r\n    indeed upon the rocks and the skipper in his bunk below drinking\r\n    bottled ditchwater. But perhaps a Captain Shotover, drunk on the\r\n    milk of human kindness rather than rum, will emerge upon the\r\n    quarterdeck and, blowing his whistle, call all hands on deck before\r\n    the last rending crash. In that unlikely event, one of those\r\n    emerging from the forecastle will be\r\n                                                     G. Bernard Shaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_90._ In spite of the anarchic and unspeakable conditions on the\r\nContinent, I could not refrain from making one last tour of inspection.\r\nThe thought of flooded mines, pillaged factories and gutted mills was\r\nmore than I could bear. The stocks of oil in England were running short,\r\nbut I commanded enough to fill my great transportplane. We flew low over\r\nroads crawling with humanity as a sick animal crawls with vermin. Some\r\ncities were empty, obscenely bereft of population; others choked with\r\nwanderers.\r\n\r\nThe Ruhr was a valley filled with the dead, with men tearing each\r\nother's throats in a frenzy of hunger, with the unburied and the soon to\r\nbe buried sleeping sidebyside through restless nights. Not a building\r\nwas still whole; what had not been torn down in pointless rage had been\r\nrazed by reasonless arson. Not one brick of the great openhearths had\r\nbeen left in place, not one girder of the great sheds remained erect.\r\n\r\nThe Saar was in little better case and the mines of Alsace were useless\r\nfor the next quartercentury. The industrial district around Paris had\r\nbeen leveled to the ground by the mobs and Belgium looked as it had\r\nafter the worst devastation of war. I had expected to find a shambles,\r\nbut my utmost anticipations were exceeded. I could bring myself to look\r\nupon no more and my pilot informing me that our gas was low, I ordered\r\nhim to return.\r\n\r\nWe were in sight of the Channel, not far from Calais, when both\r\nstarboard engines developed trouble simultaneously and my pilot headed\r\nfor a landingfield below. \"What are you about, you fool?\" I shouted at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Gasline fouled. I think I can fix it in a few minutes, Mr Weener.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not down among those savages. We wouldnt have a chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"We wouldnt have a chance over the Channel, sir. I'd rather risk my neck\r\namong fellow humans than in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you would, but I wouldnt. Straighten out the plane and go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Mr Weener; I'm going to have to land here.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in spite of my protests he did so. I was instantly proved right, for\r\nbefore we came to a stop we were surrounded by an assortment of filthy\r\nand emaciated men and women bearing scythes and pitchforks, shouting,\r\nyelling and gesticulating, making in fact, such an uproar that no\r\ncomprehension was possible. However, there was no misunderstanding their\r\nbrusque motions ordering us away from the plane or the threatening\r\nnoises which reinforced the command. No sooner had we reluctantly\r\ncomplied than they proceeded methodically to puncture the tires and\r\nsmash the propellers.\r\n\r\nMy horror at this marooning among the degenerates was not lessened by\r\ntheir ugly and illdisposed looks and I feared they would not be content\r\nwith smashing the plane, but would take out their animus against those\r\nwho had not sunk into their own bestial state by destroying us as well.\r\nSince I do not speak much French, I could only say to the man nearest\r\nme, a sinister fellow in a blue smock with a brown stockingcap on his\r\nhead, \"C'est un disgrace, ça; je demandez le pourquoi.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me for a baffled moment before calling, \"Jean, Jean!\"\r\n\r\nJean was even more illfavored, having a scar across his mouth which gave\r\nhim an artificial harelip. However, he spoke English of a kind. \"Your\r\nairship has been confiscated, citizen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you mean? That plane is my personal property.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no personal property in the Republic One and Indivisible,\"\r\nreplied Jean. \"Be thankful your life is spared, Citizen Englishman, and\r\ngo without further argumentations.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose it was reasonable to take this advice, but I could not resist\r\ninforming him, \"I am not an Englishman, but an American. We also had a\r\nRepublic one and indivisible.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"On your ways, citizen. The Republic does not make\r\ndistinctions between one bourgeois and another.\"\r\n\r\nI looked around for the pilot, but he had vanished. Alone, furious at\r\nthe act of robbery and not a little apprehensive, I began walking toward\r\nthe coast; but I was not steeled against isolation among the barbarians\r\nof the Continent, nor dressed for such an excursion. Between anxiety\r\nlest I run into a less pompous and more bloodthirsty group of\r\nrepresentatives of the Republic One and Indivisible--when it had come\r\ninto being, how far its authority extended or how long it lasted I never\r\nlearned--and the burning and blistering of my feet in their thinsoled\r\nshoes, I doubt if I was more than a few miles from the airfield and\r\ntherefore many from the coast when darkness fell. I kept on, tired,\r\nanxious, hungry, in no better plight than thousands of other wretches\r\nwho at the same moment were heading the same way under identical\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe only advantage of traveling by night was the removal of my fear of\r\nthe intentions of men, but nature made up for this by putting her own\r\nobstacles in my way. The hedgerows which had been allowed to grow wild,\r\nthe unrepaired roadways, sunken and marked by deep holes and ruts and a\r\nhundred other pitfalls made my progress agonizingly slow.\r\n\r\nAs the moon rose I had a sudden feeling of being near water, and coming\r\nout from a thicket I was confirmed in this by seeing the light break\r\ninto ripples on an uneven surface. But tragically, it was not the\r\nChannel I had come upon, merely a river, too wide to cross, which though\r\nit undoubtedly led to my goal, would increase the length of my journey\r\nby many miles. I'm afraid I gave way to a quite unmanly weakness as I\r\nthrew myself upon the hard ground and thought of my miserable fate.\r\n\r\nI may have lain there for ten minutes, or twenty. The moon went behind a\r\ncloud, the air grew chilly. I was nerving myself to get up and resume my\r\njourney--though to what purpose I could not conceive for I would be\r\nlittle better off on a Norman beach than inland--when a timid hand was\r\nput upon my shoulder and someone said questioningly, \"Angleterre?\"\r\n\r\nI sprang up. \"England. Oh, yes, England. Can you help me get there?\"\r\n\r\nThe moon stayed covered and I could not see his face in the dark.\r\n\"England,\" he said. \"Yes, I'll take you.\"\r\n\r\nI followed him to a little backwater, where was beached a rowboat. Even\r\nby feel, in the blackness, it seemed to me a very small and frail craft\r\nto chance the voyage across the choppy sea, but I had no choice. I\r\nseated myself in the stern while he took the oars, cast off and rowed us\r\ndown the river toward the estuary.\r\n\r\nI decided he must be one of that company of smugglers who were ferrying\r\nrefugees into Britain despite the strictest watch. No doubt he thinks to\r\nmake a pretty penny for tonight's work, I thought, but no coastguard\r\nwould turn back Albert Weener. I would pay him well for his help, but he\r\ncould not blackmail me for fabulous ransom.\r\n\r\nStill the moon did not come out. My eyes, accustoming themselves to the\r\ndark, vaguely discerned the shape opposite me and I saw he was a short\r\nman, but beyond this I could not distinguish his features. The river\r\nbroadened, the air became salty, the wind rose and soon the little boat\r\nwas bobbing up and down in a manner to give discomfort to my stomach.\r\nThe water, building terraces and battlements, reflected enough light to\r\nimpress me with the diminutiveness of the boat, set in the vastness on\r\nwhich it floated.\r\n\r\nBehind us the French coast was a looming mass, then a thick blob,\r\nfinally a thin blur hardly perceptible to strained eyes. I was\r\nthoroughly seasick, retching and vomiting over the narrow freeboard.\r\nSteadily and rhythmically the man rowed with tireless arms, apparently\r\nunaffected by the boat's leaping and dropping in response to the impulse\r\nof the waves and in my intervals of relief from nausea I reflected that\r\nhe must have gained plenty of practice, that he was an old hand in\r\nmaking this trip. It was a peculiar way to gain wealth, I thought,\r\ncaught in another spasm of sickness, enriching oneself on the misery of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI vomited and dozed, dozed and vomited. The night was endless, the wind\r\nwas bitter. What riches, I wondered, could compensate a man for such\r\nhardships? By the time the wanderers got to the Channel they could not\r\nvery well have much left and unless my smuggler were gifted with\r\nsecondsight he could not know, judging by the way he had accosted me,\r\nwhether he was carrying a man who could pay £10, £100 or £500 for the\r\naccommodation. Well, I philosophized, it takes all kinds to make a\r\nworld, and who am I to say this illicit trafficker isnt doing as much\r\ngood in his way as I in mine?\r\n\r\nI don't know when my nausea finally left me, unless it was after nothing\r\nwhatever remained in my stomach. I sat limp and cold, conscious only of\r\nthe erratic bobbing of the little vessel and the ceaseless rhythm of the\r\noars. At last, unbelievably, the sky turned from black to gray. I could\r\nnot believe it anything but an optical illusion in the endless night and\r\nI strained to dissipate whatever biliousness was affecting my vision.\r\nBut it was dawn, sure enough, and soon it revealed the pettish,\r\nwallowing Channel and the fragile outline of our boat, even tinier than\r\nI had conceived. I shuddered with more than cold--had I known what a\r\ncockleshell it was I might have paused before trusting my life so\r\nreadily to it.\r\n\r\nLine by line the increasing light drew the countenance of my guide. At\r\nfirst he was nothing but a shape, well muffled, with some kind of flat\r\ncap upon his head. A little more light revealed a glittering eye, more,\r\na great, hooked nose with wide nostrils. He was a man of uncertain age,\r\nbordering upon the elderly, with a black skullcap under which curled\r\noutward two silverygray horns of hair. The lower part of his face was\r\ncovered with a grizzled beard.\r\n\r\nHe must have been studying me as intently, for he now broke the silence\r\nwhich had prevailed all night. \"You are not a poor man,\" he announced\r\naccusingly. \"How is it you have waited so long?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid youve made a mistake in me, my friend,\" I told him jovially,\r\n\"we shan't be making an illegal entry. I am resident in England and can\r\ncome home at any time.\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent; from disappointment, I concluded. \"Never mind, I'll pay\r\nyou as much as a refugee--within reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a follower of reason, sir?\"\r\n\r\nI tried hard to make out more of his still obscured face for there was a\r\nnote of irony in his voice. \"I believe we'd all be better off if\r\neveryone were to accept things philosophically. Responsible people will\r\nfind a way to end our troubles eventually and in the meantime madness\r\nand violence--\" I waved my hand to the French coast behind--\"don't help\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he said without pausing in his rowing, \"men alone, then, will\r\nsolve Man's problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who Else, indeed?\"\r\n\r\nThe smuggler's answer or confirmation or whatever the equivocal echo was\r\nirritated me. \"You think our problems can be solved from the outside?\"\r\n\r\nHe managed to shrug his shoulders without breaking the rhythm of his\r\narms. \"Perhaps my English is unequal to understanding what you mean by\r\noutside. All the forces I know are represented within.\"\r\n\r\nI was baffled and switched the subject to more immediate themes. \"Are we\r\nabout halfway, do you think?\"\r\n\r\nThe light now exposed him fully. His hands were small and I doubted if\r\nthe arms extending from them were muscular, but he radiated an air of\r\ngreat vitality. His face was lined, his eyes fierce under outthrust\r\neyebrows, his lips--where the crisp waves of his beard permitted them to\r\nshow--stern, but his whole demeanor was not unkindly.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to measure how far we have come, but who can say how far we\r\nhave to go?\"\r\n\r\nThis metaphysical doubletalk annoyed me. \"I don't know what is happening\r\nto people,\" I said. \"Either they act like those over there,\" I gestured\r\ntoward the Republic One and Indivisible, \"or else they become mystics.\"\r\n\r\n\"You find questions without immediate answers mystical, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I like my questions to be susceptible to an answer of some kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a man of thought.\"\r\n\r\nIt amused me to speak intimately to this stranger. \"I have lived inside\r\nmyself a great many years. Naturally my mind has not been idle all the\r\nwhile.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not married?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never had the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah.\" He rowed quietly for some moments. \"'Never had the time,'\" he\r\nrepeated thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"You think marriage is important?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man without children disowns his parents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds like a proverb.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not. Just an observation. I suppose since you have not had the\r\ntime to marry you have devoted your life to good works.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given employment to many, and help to the pauperized.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is commanded to be charitable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given millions of dollars--hundreds of thousands of pounds to\r\nphilanthropies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anonymously, of course. You must be a godly man, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am an agnostic. I do not know if there is such a thing.\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. \"Beneath us there are fish who do not know it is the\r\nsea in which they swim; above us there are birds unaware of the reaches\r\nof the sky. The fish have no conception of sky; the birds know nothing\r\nof the deep. They are agnostics also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it doesnt seem to do them any harm. Fishes continue to spawn and\r\nbirds to nest without the benefits of esoteric knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Fish remain fish in happy ignorance; doubt does not cause a\r\nbird to falter in its flight.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was pushed into the air from the waters as a ball is pushed by\r\nthe thumb and forefinger. The chalkcliffs were outlined ahead of me and\r\nI calculated we had little more than an hour to go. \"You have chosen a\r\nstrange way of earning a living, my friend,\" I ventured at last.\r\n\r\n\"Upon some is laid the yoke of the Law, others depend upon the sun for\r\nlight,\" he said. \"Perhaps, like yourself, I have committed some great\r\nsin and am expiating it in this manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you mean. I am conscious of no sin--if I understand\r\nthe meaning of the theological term.\"\r\n\r\n\"'We have trespassed,'\" he murmured dreamily, \"'we have been faithless,\r\nwe have robbed, we have spoken basely, we have committed iniquity, we\r\nhave wrought unrighteousness----'\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the rational world discarded the superstitions of religion\r\nhalfacentury ago,\" I said, \"we have learned that good and evil are\r\nrelative terms; without meaning, actually.\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time he suspended his oars and the boat wallowed crazily.\r\n\"Excuse me,\" he resumed his exertions. \"Good is evil sometimes and evil\r\nis good upon occasion?\"\r\n\r\n\"It depends on circumstances and the point of view. What is beneficial\r\nat one time and place may be detrimental under other circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah. Green is green today, but it was yellow yesterday and will be blue\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even such an exaggeration could be defended; however, that was not my\r\nmeaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"'We have wrought unrighteousness, we have been presumptuous, we have\r\ndone violence, we have forged lies, we have counseled evil, we have\r\nlied, we have scoffed, we have revolted, we have blasphemed, we have\r\nbeen rebellious, we have acted perversely, we have transgressed, we have\r\npersecuted----'\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have,\" I interrupted with some asperity, \"but I don't\r\nbelong in that category. Far from persecuting, I have always believed in\r\ntolerance. Live and let live, I always say. People can't help the color\r\nof their skins or the race they were born into.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they could they would naturally choose to be white northEuropean\r\ngentiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should anyone voluntarily embrace a status of inconvenience?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, indeed? 'We have persecuted, we have been stiffnecked, we have\r\ndone wickedly, we have corrupted ourselves, we have committed\r\nabominations, we have gone astray and we have led astray....'\"\r\n\r\nWe both fell silent after this catalogue, quite inapplicable to the\r\nsituation, and it was with heartfelt thanks I distinguished each fault\r\nand seam in the Dover Cliffs as well as the breaking line of surf below.\r\n\r\nI presumed because of what I'd said about legal entry he was not\r\navoiding the coastguard, but with a practiced oar he suddenly veered and\r\ndrove us onto a minute sandy beach at the foot of the cliffs, obviously\r\nunfrequented and probably unknown to officialdom. A narrow yet clearly\r\ndefined path led upward; this was evidently his customary haven. Were I\r\nan emotional man I would have kissed the little strip of shingle, as it\r\nwas I contented myself with a deep sigh of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nMy guide stood on the sand, smoothing the long, shapeless garment he\r\nwore against his spare body. He had taken a small book from his pocket\r\nand was mumbling some unintelligible words aloud. I was struck again by\r\nthe nervous vigor of the man which had given him the strength to row\r\nall night against a harsh sea--and presumably would generate the energy\r\nnecessary for the return trip.\r\n\r\nI pulled out my wallet and extracted two £100 banknotes. No one could\r\nsay Albert Weener didnt reward service handsomely. \"Here you are, my\r\nfriend,\" I said, \"and thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept your thanks.\" He bowed slightly, putting his hands behind him\r\nand moving toward his boat.\r\n\r\nPerversely, since he seemed bent on rejecting my reward, I became\r\nanxious to press it upon him. \"Don't be foolish,\" I argued. \"This is a\r\nperilous game, this running in of refugees. You can't do it for\r\npleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a work of charity.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know how this shabby fellow conceived charity, but I had never\r\nunderstood that virtue to conflict with the law. \"You mean you ferry all\r\nthese strays for nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"My payment is predetermined and exact.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are foolish. Anyone using your boat for illegal entry would be glad\r\nto give everything he possessed for the trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many penniless ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Need that be your concern--to the extent of risking your life and\r\ndevoting all your time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can speak for no one but myself. It need be my concern.\"\r\n\r\n\"One man can't do much. Oh, don't think I don't sympathize with your\r\nattitude. I too pity these poor people deeply; I have given thousands of\r\npounds to relieve them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Their plight touches your heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed it does. Never in all history have so many been so wretched\r\nthrough no fault of their own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" he agreed thoughtfully. \"For you it is something strange and\r\npathetic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tragic would be a better word.\"\r\n\r\n\"But for us it is an old story.\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed his boat into the water. \"An old story,\" he repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, wait--the money!\"\r\n\r\nHe jumped in and began rowing. I waved the banknotes ridiculously in\r\nthe air. His body bent backward and forward, urging the boat away from\r\nme with each pull. \"Your money!\" I yelled.\r\n\r\nHe moved steadily toward the French shore. I watched him recede into the\r\nChannel mists and thought, another madman. I turned away at last and\r\nbegan to ascend the path up the cliff.\r\n\r\n\r\n_91._ When I finally got back to Hampshire, worn out by my ordeal and\r\nfeeling as though I'd aged ten years, there was a message from Miss\r\nFrancis on my desk. Even her bumptious rudeness could not conceal the\r\njubilation with which she'd penned it.\r\n\r\n\"To assuage your natural fear for the continued safety of Albert\r\nWeener's invaluable person, I hasten to inform you that I believe I have\r\na workable compound. It may be a mere matter of weeks now before we\r\nshall begin to roll back _Cynodon dactylon_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIX\r\n\r\n_Mr Weener Sees It Through_\r\n\r\n\r\n_92._ Whether it was from the exposure I endured on that dreadful trip\r\nor from disease germs which must have been plentiful among the\r\ncontinental savages and the man who rowed me back to England, I don't\r\nknow, but that night I was seized with a violent chill, an aching head\r\nand a dry, enervating fever. I sent for the doctor and went to bed and\r\nit was a week before I was myself enough to be cognizant of what was\r\ngoing on around me.\r\n\r\nDuring my illness I was delirious and I'm sure I afforded my nurses\r\nplentiful occasion to snicker at the ravings of someone of no\r\ninconsiderable importance as he lay helpless and sick. \"Paper and\r\npencil, you kep callin for, Mr Weener--an you that elpless you couldnt\r\nold up your own and. You said you ad to write a book--the Istory of the\r\nGrass. To purge yourself, you said. Lor, Mr Weener, doctors don't\r\nprescribe purges no more--that went out before the first war.\"\r\n\r\nI never had a great deal of patience with theories of psychology--they\r\nseem to smack too much of the confessional and the catechism. But as I\r\nunderstand it, it is claimed that there exists what is called an\r\nunconscious--a reservoir of all sorts of thoughts lurking behind the\r\nconscious mind. The desires of this unconscious are powerful and tend to\r\nbe expressed any time the conscious mind is offguard. Whether this\r\nmetaphysical construction be valid or not, it seemed to me that some\r\nsuch thing had taken place while I was sick and my unconscious, or\r\nwhatever it was, had outlined a very sensible project. There was no\r\nreason why I shouldnt write such a history as soon as I could take the\r\ntime from my affairs. Certainly I had the talent for it and I believed\r\nit would give me some satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMy pleasant speculations and plans for this literary venture were\r\ninterrupted, as was my convalescence, by the loss of the Sahara depots.\r\nWhen I got the news, my principal concern wasnt for the incalculable\r\ndamage to Consolidated Pemmican. My initial reaction was amazement at\r\nthe ability of the devilgrass to make its way so rapidly across a\r\nsterile and waterless waste. In the years since its first appearance it\r\nhad truly adapted itself to any climate, altitude, or condition\r\nconfronting it. A few months before, the catastrophe would have plunged\r\nme into profound depression; now, with the resilience of recovery added\r\nto Miss Francis' assurance, it became merely another setback soon to be\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nFrom Senegal, near the middle of the great African bulge, to Tunis at\r\nthe continent's northern edge, up through Sardinia and Corsica, the\r\nlatest front of the Grass was arrayed. It occupied most of Italy and\r\nclimbed the Alps to bite the eastern tip from Switzerland. It took\r\nBavaria and the rest of Germany beyond the Weser. Only the Netherlands,\r\nBelgium, France, Spain and Portugal--a geographical purist might have\r\nadded Luxembourg, Andorra and Monaco--remained untouched upon the\r\nContinent. Into this insignificant territory and the British Isles were\r\npacked all that was left of the world's two billion people: a blinded,\r\nstarving mob, driven mad by terror. How many there were there,\r\nsquirming, struggling, dying in a desperate unwillingness to give up\r\nexistence, no matter how intolerable, no one could calculate; any more\r\nthan a census could be taken of the numbers buried beneath the Grass now\r\nholding untroubled sway over ninetenths of the globe.\r\n\r\nWatchers were set upon the English coast in a manner reminiscent of\r\n1940. I don't know exactly what value the giving of the alarm would have\r\nbeen; nevertheless, night and day eyes were strained through binoculars\r\nand telescopes for signs of the unique green on the horizon or the\r\nfirst seed slipping through to find a home on insular soil.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis' optimistic news had been communicated to the authorities,\r\nbut not given out over the BBC. This was an obvious precaution against a\r\nwave of concerted invasion by the fear obsessed horde beyond the\r\nChannel. While they might respect our barriers if the hope for survival\r\nwas dim, a chance pickup of the news that the Grass was doomed would be\r\nsure to send its destined victims frenziedly seeking a refuge until the\r\nconsummation occurred. If such a thing happened our tiny islands would\r\nbe suffocated by refugees, our stores would not last a week, and we\r\nshould all go down to destruction together.\r\n\r\nBut in the mysterious way of rumor, the news spread to hearten the\r\nislanders. They had always been determined to fight the Grass--if\r\nnecessary as the Chinese had fought it till overwhelmed--indeed, what\r\nother course had they? But now their need was only to hold it at bay\r\nuntil the new discovery could be implemented. And there was good chance\r\nof its being put to use before the Grass had got far beyond the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_93._ Now we were on the last lap, my interest in the progress of the\r\nscientific tests was such that I insisted upon being present at every\r\nfield experiment. For some reason Miss Francis didnt care for this and\r\ntried to dissuade me, both by her disagreeable manner (her\r\neccentricity--craziness would undoubtedly be a more accurate\r\nterm--increased daily) and by her assurances I couldnt possibly find\r\nanything to hold my attention there. But of course I overruled her and\r\ndidnt miss a single one of these fascinating if sometimes disappointing\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\nI vividly recall the first one. She had reiterated there would be\r\nnothing worth watching--even at best no spectacular results were\r\nexpected--but I made myself one of the party just the same. The theater\r\nwas a particularly dismal part of Dartmoor and for some reason, probably\r\nknown only to herself, she had chosen dawn for the time. We arrived,\r\ncold and uncomfortable, in two saloon cars, the second one holding\r\nseveral long cylinders similar to the oxygen or acetylene tanks commonly\r\nused in American industry.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of mysterious consultation between Miss Francis\r\nand her assistants, punctuated by ritualistic samplings of the\r\nvegetation and soil. When these ceremonies were complete four stakes and\r\na wooden mallet were produced and the corners of a square, about 200 by\r\n200, were pegged. The cylinders were unloaded, set in place at equal\r\nintervals along one side of the square, turncocks and nozzles with\r\nelongated sprayjets attached, and the valves opened.\r\n\r\nA fine mist issued forth, settling gently over the stakedout area. Miss\r\nFrancis, her toothpick suspended, stood in rapt contemplation. At the\r\nend of thirty minutes the spray was turned off and the containers rolled\r\nback into the car. Except for the artificial dew upon it, the moor\r\nlooked exactly as it had before.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Weener, are you going to stand there and gawk for the next\r\ntwentyfour hours or are you coming back with us?\"\r\n\r\nI could tell by their expressions how horrified her assistants were at\r\nthe rudeness to which I'd become so accustomed I no longer noticed it.\r\n\"It's not a success, then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"How the devil do I know? I have no crystal ball to show me tomorrow.\r\nAnyway, even if it works on the miscellaneous growth here I havent the\r\nremotest idea how the Grass will react to it. This is only a remote\r\npreliminary, as I told you before, and why you encumbered us with your\r\ninquisitiveness is more than I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Youre coming back tomorrow, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. Did you think I just put this on for fun--in order to go\r\naway and forget it? Weener, I always knew those who made money werent\r\nparticularly brilliant, but arent you a little backward, even for a\r\nbillionaire?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt she indulged in these boorish discourtesies simply to\r\nbuoy up her own ego, which must have suffered greatly. She presumed on\r\nher sex and my tolerance, taking the same pleasure in baiting me, on\r\nwhom she was utterly dependent, as a terrier does in annoying a Saint\r\nBernard, knowing the big dog's chivalry will protect the pest.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned the square was clean of all growth, as though scraped\r\nwith a sharp knife. Only traces of powdery dust, not yet scattered by a\r\nbreeze, lay here and there. I was jubilant, but Miss Francis affected an\r\nair of contempt. \"Ive proved nothing I didnt know before, merely\r\nconfirmed the powers of the deterrent--under optimum conditions. It has\r\nkilled ordinary grass and some miscellaneous weeds--and that's all I can\r\nsay so far. What it will do to inoculated _Cynodon dactylon_ I have no\r\nmore idea than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But youre going to try it on the Grass immediately?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm not,\" she answered shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weener, either leave these things in my hands or else go do them\r\nyourself. You annoy me.\"\r\n\r\nI was not to be put off in so cavalier a manner and after we parted I\r\nsent for one of her assistants and ordered him to load a plane with some\r\nof the cylinders and fly to the Continent for the purpose of using the\r\nstuff directly against the Grass. When he protested such a test would be\r\nquite useless and he could not bring himself to such disloyalty to his\r\n\"chief,\" as he quaintly called Miss Francis, I had to threaten him with\r\ninstant discharge and blacklist before he came to his senses. I'm sorry\r\nto say he turned out to be a completely unreliable young man, for the\r\nplane and its crew were never heard from again--a loss I felt deeply,\r\nfor planes were becoming scarce in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_94._ As a matter of fact everything, except illegal entrants who\r\ncontinued to evade the authorities, was becoming scarce in England now.\r\nThe stocks of petroleum, acquired from the last untouched wells and\r\nrefineries and hoarded so zealously, had been limited by the storage\r\nspace available. We had a tremendous amount of food on hand, yet with\r\nour abnormally swollen population and the constant knowledge that the\r\nBritish Isles were not agriculturally selfsufficient, wartime rationing\r\nof the utmost stringency was resorted to. The people accepted their\r\nhardships, lightened by the hope given by Miss Francis' work--in turn\r\nmade possible only by me.\r\n\r\nThough I chafed at her procrastination and forced myself to swallow her\r\nincivilities, I put my personal reactions aside and with hardly an\r\nexception turned over my entire scientific resources to Miss Francis,\r\nmaking all my research laboratories subordinate to her, subject only to\r\na prudent check, exercised by a governing board of practical\r\nbusinessmen. The government cooperated wholeheartedly and thousands\r\nworked night and day devising possible variants of the basic compound\r\nand means of applying it under all conditions. It was a race between the\r\nGrass and the conquerors of the Grass; there was no doubt as to the\r\noutcome; the only question now was how far the Grass would get before it\r\nwas finally stopped.\r\n\r\nThe second experiment was carried out on the South Downs. The containers\r\nwere the same, the ceremonious interchange repeated, only the area\r\nstaked out covered about four times as much ground as the first. We\r\ndeparted as before, leaving the meadow apparently unharmed, returning to\r\nfind the square dead and wasted.\r\n\r\nOnce more I urged her to turn the compound directly upon the Grass.\r\n\"What if it isnt perfected? What harm can it do? Maybe it's advanced\r\nenough to halt the Grass even if it doesnt kill it.\"\r\n\r\nShe stabbed at her chest with the toothpick. \"Isnt it horrible to live\r\nin a world of intellectual sucklings? How can I explain what's going on?\r\nI have a basic compound in the same sense ... in the same sense, let us\r\nsay, that I know iodine to be a poison. Yes, that will do. If I wish to\r\nkill a man--some millionaire--and administer too little, far from acting\r\nas a poison it will be positively beneficial. This is a miserably\r\noversimplified analogy--perhaps you will understand it.\"\r\n\r\nI was extremely dissatisfied, knowing as I did the rapidly worsening\r\nsituation. The Grass was in the Iberian Peninsula, in Provence,\r\nBurgundy, Lorraine, Champagne and Holland. The people were restive, no\r\nlonger appeased by the tentative promise of redemption through Miss\r\nFrancis' efforts. The BBC named a date for the first attack upon the\r\nGrass, contradicted itself, said sensible men would understand these\r\nmatters couldnt be pinned down to hours and minutes. There were riots at\r\nClydeside and in South Wales and I feared the looting of my warehouses\r\nin view of the terrible scarcity of food.\r\n\r\nIt wasnt only the immediate situation which was bad, but the longrange\r\none. Oil reserves in the United Kingdom were practically exhausted. So\r\nwere non-native metals. Vital machinery needed immediate replacement. As\r\nsoon as Miss Francis was ready to go into action the strain upon our\r\nobsolescent technology and hungerweakened manpower would be crippling.\r\n\r\nThe general mood was not lightened by the clergy, professionally\r\ngloating over approaching doom, nor by the speculations of the\r\nscientists, who were now predicting an insect and aquatic world. Man,\r\nthey said, could not adapt himself to the Grass--this was proved to the\r\nhilt by the tragedy of the Russian armies in the Last War--but insects\r\nhad, fishes didnt need to, and birds, especially those who nested above\r\nthe snowline, might possibly be able to. Undoubtedly these orders could\r\nin time produce a creature equal if not superior to _Homo sapiens_ and\r\nthe march of progress stood a chance to continue after an hiatus of a\r\nfew million years or so.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these airy and abstract speculations with their\r\nslowness to produce something tangible to help us at this crisis first\r\nangered and then profoundly depressed me. I could only look upon the\r\nwhole conglomeration--scientists, politicians, common man and all--as\r\nthoroughly irresponsible. I remembered how I had applied myself\r\ndiligently, toiling, planning, imagining, to reach my present position\r\nand how a fraction of that effort, if it had been exerted by these\r\npeople, could stop the Grass overnight.\r\n\r\nIn this frameofmind my thoughts occupied themselves more and more with\r\nthe idea I had uttered during my illness. To write a history of the\r\nGrass would at least afford me an escape from the daily irritation of\r\nconcerning myself exclusively with the incompetents and blunderers. Not\r\nbeing the type of person to undertake anything I was not prepared to\r\nfinish, I thought it might be advisable to keep a journal, first to get\r\nmyself in the mood for the larger work and later to have a daytoday\r\naccount of momentous events as seen by someone uniquely connected with\r\nthe Grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_95._ _July 14_: Lunch at Chequers with the PM. Very gloomy. Says Miss F\r\nmay have to be nationalized. Feeble joke by undersecretary about\r\nnationalization of women proving unsuccessful during the Bolshevik\r\nrevolution. Ignoring this assured the PM we would get a more definite\r\ndate from her during the week. Privately agreed her dilatoriness\r\nunpardonable. I shall speak to F tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHome by 5. Gardeners slovenly; signs of neglect everywhere. Called in S\r\nand gave him a good goingover; said he was doing the best he could.\r\nSighed for the good old days--Tony Preblesham would never have shuffled\r\nlike that. Shall I have to get a new steward--and would he be any\r\nimprovement?\r\n\r\nVery bored after dinner. Almost decided to start the book. Scribbled a\r\nfew paragraphs--they didnt sound too bad. Sleep on it.\r\n\r\n_July 15_: BBC this morning reported Grass in the Ardennes. This\r\nundoubtedly means a new influx from the Continent--the coastguard is\r\npractically powerless--and we will be picked clean. In spite of the news\r\nF absolutely refuses to set a definite date. Kept my temper with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nCame home to be annoyed by Mrs H telling me K, one of the housemaids,\r\nhad been got into trouble by an undergardener. Asked Mrs H whether or\r\nnot it wasnt her function as a housekeeper to take care of such details.\r\nMrs H very tart, said in normal times she was perfectly capable of\r\nhandling the situation, but with everything going to pieces she didnt\r\nknow whether to turn off K or the undergardener, or both, or neither. I\r\nthought her attitude toward me symptomatic of the general slackness and\r\ndemoralization setting in all over. Instructed her to discharge them\r\nboth and not bother me again with such trivia. Tried to phone the PM,\r\nbut the line was down. Another symptom.\r\n\r\nAs a sort of refuge, went to the library and wrote for four solid hours,\r\nrelating the origin of the Grass. Feeling much better afterwards, rang\r\nfor Mrs H and told her merely to give K a leave of absence and discharge\r\nonly the guilty undergardener. I could see she didnt approve my\r\nleniency.\r\n\r\n_July 16_: A maniac somehow got into The Ivies and forced his way into\r\nthe library where I was writing. A horrible looking fellow, with a\r\ntortured face, he waved a pistol in front of me, ranting phrases\r\nreminiscent of oldfashioned soapbox oratory. I am not ashamed to admit\r\nnervousness, for this is not the first time my life has been threatened\r\nsince attaining prominence. Happily, the madman's aim was as wild as his\r\nspeech, and though he fired four shots, all lodged in the plaster. S,\r\nMrs H and B, hearing the noise, rushed in and grabbed him.\r\n\r\n_July 17_: A little upset by the episode of the wouldbe assassin, I\r\ndecided to go up to London for the day. The library would be unusable\r\nanyway, while the walls and ceiling were being repaired.\r\n\r\n_July 18_: Shaking experience. Can write no more at the moment.\r\n\r\n_Later_: I was walking in Regent Square when I saw her. As beautiful and\r\nmysterious as she was last time. But now my tongue was not tied;\r\noblivious to restraint and ridicule, I shouted, rushed after her.\r\n\r\nI-- But, really, that is all. I rushed after her, but she disappeared in\r\nthe idle crowd. People looked at me curiously as I pushed and shoved,\r\npeering, crying, \"Wait, wait a minute!\" But she was gone.\r\n\r\n_Still later_: I shall go back to The Ivies tonight. If I stay longer in\r\nLondon I fear I shall be subject to further hallucinations.\r\n\r\nIf it was an hallucination and not the Strange Lady herself.\r\n\r\n_July 19_: Grass reported in Lyons. F has new experiment scheduled for\r\ntomorrow. Despite upset condition, I wrote six pages of my history. The\r\nwork of concentrating, under the circumstances, was terrific but I feel\r\nrepaid for my effort. I am the captain of my soul.\r\n\r\nS says the cottagers no longer paying rent. Told him to evict them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_96._ _July 20_: F's test today on some underbrush in a wood. Think in\r\nfuture I shall go only to inspect the results; the spraying is very\r\ndull. Wrote four pages and tore them up. S says it is impossible to\r\nevict tenants. Asked him if there were no law left in England and he\r\nanswered, \"Not very much.\" I shall begin looking about for a new\r\nsteward. Hear the Tharios are in London. Grass reported beyond the\r\nVosges.\r\n\r\n_July 21_: Usual aftermath of F's experiment. Not a sign of vegetation\r\nleft. In the face of this, simply maddening that she doesnt get into\r\naction directly against the Grass. Got no satisfaction from her by\r\ndirect questioning. Can her whole attitude be motivated by some sort of\r\ndiseased and magnified femininity?\r\n\r\n_July 22_: Noticed Burlet at breakfast had left off his striped\r\nwaistcoat. Such a thing has never happened before. Not surprised when he\r\nrequested interview. He began by saying it had been quite some time\r\nsince he put before me his plan for what he calls \"vertical cities.\" Not\r\ncaring for his attitude, pointed out that it was quite outside my\r\nprovince as an employer to wetnurse any schemes of his; nevertheless,\r\nout of kindness I had brought it to the attention of the proper people.\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr Weener, sir, people are losing their lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you said before, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if nothing is done the time will come when you also will be killed\r\nby refugees or drowned by the Grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"That borders on impertinence, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ope I ave never forgot my place. But umanity takes precedence over\r\numility.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be all, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir. If convenient, I should like to give notice as of the\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Burlet.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he left, I was unreasonably disturbed. If I had pressed his\r\nscheme--but it was impracticable....\r\n\r\n_July 23_: The Grass is in the neighborhood of Antwerp and questions are\r\nbeing asked in Parliament. Unless the government can offer satisfactory\r\nassurances of action by F they are expected to fall tomorrow. Assured\r\nthe PM I would put the utmost pressure on F, but I know it will do no\r\ngood. The woman is mad; I would have her certified and locked up in an\r\nasylum in a second if only some other scientist would show some signs of\r\ngetting results. Did not write a word on my history today.\r\n\r\n_July 24_: Debate in Parliament. Got nothing from F but rudeness. Wrote\r\nconsiderably on my book. I would like to invite Stuart Thario to The\r\nIvies, if for no other reason than to show I bear no malice, but perhaps\r\nit would not be wise.\r\n\r\nRiots in Sheffield.\r\n\r\n_July 25_: Vote of confidence in Commons. The PM asked the indulgence of\r\nthe House and played a record of Churchill's famous speech: \"... Turning\r\nto the question of invasion ... We shall not fail; we shall go on to the\r\nend ... We shall defend our island whatever the cost. We shall fight on\r\nbeaches, in cities and on the hills. We shall never surrender.\" Result,\r\nthe government squeaked through; 209 for, 199 against, 176 abstaining.\r\nNo one satisfied with the results.\r\n\r\nMrs H came to me in great distress. It seems the larder is empty of\r\nchutney, curry and worcestershire sauce and none of these items can be\r\npurchased at Fortnum & Mason's or anywhere else. I assured her it was a\r\nmatter of indifference to me since I did not care particularly for any\r\nof these delicacies.\r\n\r\nMrs H swept this aside as entirely irrelevant. \"No wellconducted\r\nestablishment, Mr Weener, is without chutney, curry or worcestershire.\"\r\nThe insularity of the English is incredible. I have not tasted cocacola,\r\nhotdogs, or had a bottle of ketchup for more than a year, but I don't\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\nThe Grass is in the Schelde estuary, almost within sight of the English\r\ncoast. I got nothing written on my history today.\r\n\r\n_July 26_: Invited to see film of a flight made about six months ago\r\nover what was once the United States. Very moving. New York still\r\nrecognizable from the awkward shapes assumed there by the Grass. In the\r\nharbor a strange mound of vegetation. Several of the ladies wept.\r\n\r\nI went home and thought about George Thario and carried my history of\r\nthe Grass up until the time it crossed Hollywood Boulevard.\r\n\r\n_July 27_: The Grass is now in Ostend, definitely in sight from the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n_July 28_: Grass in Dunkirk.\r\n\r\n_July 29_: F astounded me this morning by coming to The Ivies, an\r\nunprecedented thing. She is (finally!!!) about to undertake tests\r\ndirectly against the Grass and wants airplanes and gasoline. I impressed\r\nupon her how limited our facilities are and how they cannot be frittered\r\naway. She screamed at me insanely (the woman is positively dangerous in\r\nthese frenzies) and I finally calmed her with the assurance--only\r\nsuperficially exact--that I was dependent on the authorities for these\r\nsupplies. At length I persuaded her she could just as well use motor\r\nlaunches since the Grass had now reached the Channel. She reluctantly\r\nagreed and grumblingly departed. My joy and relief in her belated action\r\nwas dampened by her arrogant intemperance. Can a woman so unbalanced\r\nreally save humanity?\r\n\r\n_July 30_: Wrote.\r\n\r\n_July 31_: Wrote.\r\n\r\n_August 1_: Attended at breakfast by footman. Extremely awkward and\r\nirritating. Inquired, what had happened to Burlet? Reminded he had left.\r\nAnnoyed at this typical lack of consideration on the part of the\r\nemployed classes. We give them work and they respond with a lack of\r\ngratitude which is amazing.\r\n\r\nIn spite of vexations, I brought my history up to the wiping out of Los\r\nAngeles. Leave with F and party at midnight for the tests.\r\n\r\n_August 4_: It is impossible for me to set down the extent of the\r\ndepression which besets me. F's assurance she has learned a great deal\r\nfrom the tests and didnt for a minute expect to drive the Grass back at\r\nthis point doesnt counter the fact that her latest spray hadnt the\r\nslightest effect on the green mass which has now replaced the sandy\r\nbeaches of the Pas de Calais. At great personal inconvenience I\r\naccompanied her on her fruitless mission and I didnt find her excuses,\r\neven when clothed in scientific verbiage, adequate compensation for the\r\nwasted time.\r\n\r\n_August 5_: The government finally fell today and there is talk of a\r\ncoalition of national unity, with the Queen herself assuming\r\nextraordinary powers. There was general agreement that this would be\r\nquite unconstitutional, but that won't prevent its being done anyway.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the stringent watch against refugees the population has so\r\nenlarged that rations have again been cut. Mrs H says she doesnt know\r\nwhere the next meal is coming from, but I feel she exaggerates. Farmers,\r\nI hear, absolutely refuse to deliver grain.\r\n\r\n_August 6_: Interview with S C. Offered him all the facilities now at\r\nthe disposal of F. I admitted I was not without influence and could\r\nalmost promise him a knighthood or an earldom. He said, \"Mr Weener, I\r\ndon't need the offer of reward; I'm doing my best right now. But I'm\r\nproceeding along entirely different lines than Miss Francis. If I were\r\nto take her work over at this point I'd nullify whatever advance she's\r\nmade and not help my own research by as much as an inch.\" If C can't\r\nreplace F, I don't know who can. Very despondent, but wrote just the\r\nsame. Can't give in to moods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_97._ _August 7_: BBC announced this morning the Grass is in Bordeaux\r\nand under the Defense of the Realm Act every man and woman is\r\nautomatically in service and will be solely responsible for a hundred\r\nsquare feet of the island's surface, their stations to be assigned by\r\nthe chief county constable. Tried to get Sir H C--no phone service.\r\n\r\nWrote on my history till noon. What a lot of bluster professional\r\nauthors make over the writing of a book--they should have had the\r\nnecessity every businessman knows for sticking eternally to it, and\r\nexperience in a newspaper cityroom--as I had. Just before luncheon an\r\noverworked looking police constable bicycled over with designations of\r\nthe areas each of us is responsible for. Sir H very thoughtfully\r\nallotted the patrolling of my library to me.\r\n\r\n_August 8_: Grass in Troyes and Châlons. The assignment of everyone to a\r\ndefinite post has raised the general spirit. Ive always said discipline\r\nwas what people needed in times of crisis--takes their minds off their\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister spoke briefly over the wireless, announcing he was in\r\nconstant touch with all the researchworkers, including Miss Francis.\r\nAnnoyed at his going over my head this way--a quite unnecessary\r\ndiscourtesy.\r\n\r\nMarked incivility and slipshodness among the staff. Spoke to Mrs H and\r\nto S; both agreed it was deplorable, saw no immediate help for it. So\r\nupset by petty annoyances I could not write on my history.\r\n\r\n_August 9_: Glorious news. The BBC announced the antiGrass compound\r\nwould be perfected before Christmas.\r\n\r\n_August 10_: F denies validity of the wireless report. Said no one with\r\nthe remotest trace of intelligence would make such a statement. \"Is it\r\nimpossible to have the compound by then?\" I asked her.\r\n\r\n\"It's not impossible to have it by tomorrow morning. Good heavens,\r\nWeener, can't you understand? I'm not a soothsayer.\"\r\n\r\nCan it be some scientist I know nothing of is getting ahead of her? Very\r\ndishonorable of the government if so.\r\n\r\nDespite uncertainties wrote three more pages.\r\n\r\n_August 11_: Riots in Manchester and Birmingham. Demagogues pointing out\r\nthat even if the antiGrass compound is perfected by Christmas it will be\r\ntoo late to save Britain. They don't count apparently on the Channel\r\nholding the plague back for long. Possible the government may fall,\r\nwhich won't disturb me, as I prefer the other party anyway.\r\n\r\n_August 12_: After a long period of silence from the Continent, Radio\r\nMondiale went on the air from Cherbourg asking permission for the\r\ngovernment to come to London.\r\n\r\n_August 13_: The watch on the south and east coasts has been tripled,\r\nmore as a precaution against the neverceasing wave of invasion than the\r\nGrass. It has been necessary to turn machineguns on the immigrant\r\nboats--purely in selfdefense.\r\n\r\nThe rioting in the Midlands has died down, possibly on the double\r\nassurance that permission for the removal of the French government had\r\nbeen refused (I cannot find out, to satisfy my idle curiosity, if it is\r\nstill the Republic One and Indivisible which made the request or whether\r\nthat creation was succeeded by a less eccentric one), and that Christmas\r\nwas a conservative estimate for the perfection of the compound--a last\r\npossible date.\r\n\r\nBrought my history up to the Last War.\r\n\r\n_August 14_: Very disheartening talk with the PM today. It seems the\r\nwhole business of setting a date was an error from beginning to end. No\r\none gave any such promise. It dare not be denied now, however, for fear\r\nof the effect upon the public. I must begin to think seriously of moving\r\nto Ireland.\r\n\r\n_August 15_: Grass reported in the Faeroes. French Channel coast covered\r\nto the mouth of the Seine. What is the matter with F? Is it possible the\r\nfailure of the last experiment blasted all her hopes? If so, she should\r\nhave told me, so I might urge on others working along different lines.\r\n\r\nMotored to the laboratory and spoke about moving to Ireland. She agreed\r\nit might be a wise precaution. \"You know, Weener, the jackass who said\r\nChristmas mightnt have been so far out afterall.\" She seemed very\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nCame home relieved of all my recent pessimism and brought my book down\r\nto the overrunning of the United States. I am not a morbid man, but I\r\npray I may live to set foot on my native soil once again.\r\n\r\n_August 16_: No new reports from France. Can the Grass be slowing down?\r\nWrote furiously.\r\n\r\n_August 17_: Wrote for nearly ten hours. Definitely decided to discharge\r\nS; he is thoroughly incapable. No word from France, but there is a\r\ngeneral feeling of great optimism.\r\n\r\n_August 18_: Bad news, very bad news. The Grass has jumped two hundred\r\nmiles, from the Faeroes to the Shetlands and we are menaced on three\r\nsides. Went up to London to arrange for a place in Ireland. I cannot say\r\nI was well received by the Irish agent, a discourteous and surly fellow.\r\nLeft orders to contact Dublin direct as soon as phone service is\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\n_August 19_: It seems Burlet has been interesting all sorts of radicals\r\nand crackpots in his scheme for glassenclosed cities. Local MP very\r\nreproachful; \"You should have warned me, Mr Weener.\" I asked him if he\r\nhonestly thought the idea practical. \"That isnt the point. Not the point\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nAs far as can be learned France is completely gone now. It is supposed a\r\nfragment of Spain and Portugal are still free of the Grass and a little\r\nbit of Africa. It is almost unbelievable that all these millions have\r\nperished and that the only untouched land left is these islands.\r\n\r\nMany irritations. The phone is in order for perhaps halfanhour a day.\r\nOnly the wireless approximates a normal schedule. Wrote six pages.\r\n\r\n_August 20_: Dublin apologized profusely for the stupidity of their\r\nagent and offered me a residence near Kilkenny and all the facilities of\r\nTrinity for F and her staff. Told F, who merely grunted. She then stated\r\nshe wanted a completely equipped seagoing laboratory for work along the\r\nFrench coast. I said I'd see what could be done. Much encouraged by\r\nthis request.\r\n\r\n_August 21_: The arrogance and shortsightedness of the workingclass is\r\nbeyond belief. They refuse absolutely to work for wages any longer. I\r\nnow have to pay for all services in concentrates. Even the warehouse\r\nguards, previously so loyal, will accept nothing but food. I foresee a\r\nrapid dwindling of our precious supplies under this onslaught.\r\n\r\n_August 22_: With all the shipping Consolidated Pemmican owns I can find\r\nnothing suitable for F's work. Almost decided to outfit my personal\r\nyacht _Sisyphus_ for that purpose. It would be convenient to use for the\r\nIrish removal if that becomes necessary.\r\n\r\nBurlet's ideas have found their way into Parliament. The Independent\r\nLabour member from South Tooting asked the Home Minister why nothing had\r\nbeen done about vertical cities. The Home Minister replied that Britons\r\nnever would permit a stolon of the Grass to grow on English soil and\r\ntherefore such fantastic ideas were superfluous. ILP MP not satisfied.\r\n\r\n_August 23_: Ordered the _Sisyphus_ to Southampton for refitting. It\r\nwill cost me thousands of tons of precious concentrates, besides lying\r\nfor weeks in a dangerously exposed spot. But I can make a better deal in\r\nSouthampton than elsewhere and I refuse to be infected by the general\r\ncowardice of the masses.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the general temper, I must say there has been a stiffening\r\nof spirit in the last week or so; very laudable, and encouraging to one\r\nwho believes in the essential dignity of human nature.\r\n\r\nNo new report on the Grass for four days.\r\n\r\n_August 24_: The member from South Tooting has introduced a bill to\r\nstart construction at once of one of Burlet's cities. The bill calls for\r\nthe conscription of manpower for the work and whatever materials may be\r\nnecessary, without compensation. The last clause is of course aimed\r\ndirectly at me. Naturally, the bill will not pass.\r\n\r\n_August 25_: Flew to Kilkenny. I fear this will be one of the last plane\r\ntrips I can make for a long time, since the store of aviation gasoline\r\nis just about exhausted. The place is much more beautiful than\r\nHampshire, but deplorably inconvenient. However, since the Irish are\r\nstill willing to work for money, I have ordered extensive alterations.\r\n\r\n_August 26_: I have stopped all sale of concentrates. Since money will\r\nbuy nothing, it would be foolish of me to give my most precious asset\r\naway. Of course we cut the deliveries down to a mere dribble some time\r\nago, but even that dribble could bleed me to death in time. I have\r\ndoubled the wages--in concentrates--of the warehouse guards in fear of\r\npossible looting.\r\n\r\n\r\n_98._ _August 29_: The last three days have been filled with terror and\r\nsuspense. It began when a patrolling shepherd on the Isle of Skye found\r\na suspicious clump of grass. All conditions favored the invader: the\r\nspot was isolated, communications were difficult, local labor was\r\ninadequate. The exhaustion of the fuel supply made it impossible to fly\r\ngrassfighters in and men had to be sent by sea with makeshift equipment.\r\nHappily there were two supercyclone fans at Lochinvar which had been\r\nshipped there by mistake and these were immediately dispatched to the\r\nthreatened area.\r\n\r\nThe clump was fought with fire and dynamite, with the fans preventing\r\nthe broken stolons from rooting themselves again. After a period of\r\ngrave anxiety and doubt there seems to be no question this particular\r\nperil has been averted--not a trace of the threatening weed remains. The\r\nQueen went personally to Westminster Abbey to give thanks.\r\n\r\n_August 30_: Work on the _Sisyphus_ proceeding slowly. I have decided to\r\nkeep my own cabin intact and have the adjoining one fitted for a writing\r\nroom. Then I can accompany F on her experimental excursions and not lose\r\nany time on my book, which is progressing famously. What a satisfaction\r\ncreative endeavor is!\r\n\r\n_August 31_: The bill for the construction of Burlet's city was debated\r\ntoday. The PM stated flatly that the Grass would be overcome before the\r\ncity could be built. (Cheers) The Hon. Member from South Tooting rose to\r\ninquire if the Right Hon. Member could offer something besides his bare\r\nword for this? (Groans, faint applause, cries of \"Shame,\" \"No\r\ngentleman,\" etcetera) The Home Minister begged to inform the Hon. Member\r\nfrom South Tooting that Her Majesty's government had gone deeply into\r\nthe question of the socalled vertical cities long before the Hon. Member\r\nhad ever heard of them. Did the Hon. Member ever consider, no matter how\r\nmany precautions were taken in the building of conduits for a water\r\nsupply, that seeds of the Grass would undoubtedly find their way in\r\nthrough that medium? Or through the air intakes, no matter how high?\r\n(Dead silence) The Hon. Member from Stoke Pogis asked if the opposition\r\nto his Hon. friend's bill wasnt the result of pressure by a certain\r\ncapitalist, concerned principally with the manufacture of concentrated\r\nfoods? (Groans and catcalls)\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer inquired if the Hon. Member meant to\r\nimpugn the integrity of the government? (Cries of \"Shame,\" \"No,\"\r\n\"Unthinkable,\" etcetera) If not, what did the Hon. Member imply?\r\n(Obstinate silence) Since no answer was forthcoming he would move for a\r\ndivision. Result: the bill overwhelmingly voted down.\r\n\r\nSince the Skye excitement everyone is inclined to be jittery and nerves\r\nare stretched tightly. When I told F she had missed a great opportunity\r\nto test her formula in Scotland she blew up and called me a meddling\r\nparasite. This is pretty good coming from a dependent. Only my\r\nforbearance and consideration for her sex kept me from turning her out\r\non the spot.\r\n\r\n_September 1_: Encouraged by the Skye episode, a group of volunteers is\r\nbeing formed to attempt an attack on the Grass covering the Channel\r\nIslands. More than can possibly be used are offering their services. I\r\nsubscribed £10,000 toward the venture.\r\n\r\nPreparations for moving to Kilkenny almost complete. Even if F gets\r\ngoing by December and the Scottish repulse is permanent, I believe I\r\nshall be better off in Ireland until the first definite victory is won\r\nagainst the Grass.\r\n\r\n_September 5_: The Grass moved again and this time all attempts to\r\nrepulse it failed. It is now firmly entrenched on both the Orkneys and\r\nthe Hebrides. Terrible pessimism. Commons voted \"No confidence\" 422 to\r\n117 and my old friend D N is back in office.\r\n\r\n_September 6_: _Sisyphus_ almost ready. Find I can get a crew to work\r\nfor wages when not in port. Luncheon at Chequers. PM urges me not to\r\nleave England as it might shake confidence. I told him I would consider\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n_September 7_: F says she is ready to make new tests and what is holding\r\nup work on the _Sisyphus_? Replied it was complete except for my cabins.\r\nShe had the effrontery to say these werent important and she was ready\r\nto go ahead without me. I pointed out that the _Sisyphus_ was my\r\nproperty and it would not sail until I was properly accommodated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_99._ _September 8_: I shall not move to Ireland afterall. The Grass has\r\na foothold in Ulster.\r\n\r\n_September 9_: The Irish are swarming into Scotland and Wales.\r\nImpossible to keep them out.\r\n\r\n_September 10_: Donegal overrun.\r\n\r\n_September 12_: On board the _Sisyphus_. Wrote an incredible amount;\r\nstill beyond me how anybody can call the fashioning of a book work. We\r\nleft Southampton last night on a full tide and are now cruising the\r\nChannel about four miles from the French coast. It is quite\r\nunbelievable--under this tropical green blanket lies the continent of\r\nEurope, the home of civilization. And the bodies of millions, too.\r\nExcept for a few gulls who shriek their way inland and return\r\ndejectedly, there is not a living thing in sight but the Grass.\r\n\r\nI have reserved the afterdeck to myself and as I sit here now,\r\nscribbling these notes, I think what impresses me more than anything\r\nelse is the feeling of vitality which radiates from the herbaceous\r\ncoast. The dead continent is alive, alive as never before--wholly\r\nalive; moving with millions of sensitive feelers in every direction. For\r\nthe first time I have a feeling of sympathy for Joe's constant talk of\r\nthe beauty of the Grass, but in spite of this, the question which comes\r\nto my mind is, can you speak glibly about the beauty of something which\r\nhas strangled nearly all the world?\r\n\r\n_Later_: Sitting on the gently swaying deck, I was moved to add several\r\npages to my history. But now we are approaching the narrower part of the\r\nChannel and the sea is getting choppy. I shall have to give up my\r\njottings for a while.\r\n\r\n_Still later_: F finally picked a spot she considered suitable--the\r\nremains of a small harbor--and we anchored. I must say she was\r\noverfussy--one cove is pretty much the same as another these days.\r\nPossibly she was so choosy in order to heighten her importance.\r\n\r\nRepetition of the involved etiquette of inspecting the intended victim\r\nand turning on the sprays; only this time the suppressed excitement\r\nanticipating possible success made even the preliminaries interesting.\r\nMiss Francis and her assistants retired for a mysterious conference\r\nimmediately after the application and I stayed up late talking with the\r\ncaptain till he was called away by some duty. It is now nearly two A M--in\r\na few hours we shall know.\r\n\r\n_September 13_: Horribly shaken this morning to find the Grass\r\nunaffected. Even wondered for a moment if it were conceivable that F\r\nwould never find the right compound--that nothing could hurt the Grass.\r\nHad I been illadvised in not going more seriously into Burlet's vertical\r\ncities?\r\n\r\nF very phlegmatic about it. Says another twelve hours of observation may\r\nbe of value. She and A rowed ashore over the runners trailing in the\r\nwater and with great difficulty succeeded in hacking off a few runners\r\nof the sprayed Grass. I thought her undertaking this hazard an absurd\r\npiece of bravado--she might just as well have sent someone else.\r\n\r\nDisregarding her rudeness in not inviting me, I accompanied her unasked\r\nto her laboratory-cabin. She laid the stolons on an enamelsurfaced table\r\nand busied herself with some apparatus. I could not take my eyes from\r\nthese segments of the Grass. They lay on the table, not specimens of\r\nvegetation, but stunned creatures ready to spring to vigorous and\r\nvengeful life when they recovered. It was impossible not to pick one up\r\nand run it through my fingers, feeling again the soft, electric touch.\r\n\r\nMiss Francis' preparations were interminable. If she follows such an\r\nelaborate ritual for the mere checking of an unsuccessful experiment no\r\nwonder she is taking years to get anywhere. My attention wandered and I\r\nstarted to leave the cabin when I noticed my hand still held one of the\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nIt was withered and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_100._ _September 17_: The enthusiasm greeting the discovery that F's\r\nreagent mortally affected the Grass was only tempered by the dampening\r\nthought that its action had been incomplete. What good was the lethal\r\ncompound if its work were final only when the sprayed parts were\r\nsevered?\r\n\r\nF seemed to think it was a great deal of good. Her manner toward me,\r\nboisterous and quite out of keeping with our respective positions and\r\nsexes, could almost be called friendly. During the return to Southampton\r\nshe constantly clapped me on the back and shouted, \"It's over, Weener;\r\nit's all over now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it isnt over,\" I protested. \"Your spray hadnt the slightest direct\r\neffect on the Grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that. That's nothing. A mere impediment. A matter of time only.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time only! Good God, do you realize the Grass is halfway through\r\nIreland? That we are surrounded now on four sides?\"\r\n\r\n\"A lastminute rescue is quite in the best tradition. Don't disturb\r\nyourself; you will live to gloat over the deaths of better men.\"\r\n\r\nI urged the PM to be cautious about overoptimism in giving out the news.\r\nHe nodded his head solemnly in agreement, but he evidently couldnt\r\ncommunicate whatever wisdom he possessed to the BBC announcer, for he,\r\nin butter voice, spoke as though Miss Francis had actually destroyed a\r\ngreat section of the weed upon the French coast. There were celebrations\r\nin the streets of London and a vast crowd visited the cenotaph and sang\r\n_Rule Britannia_.\r\n\r\n_September 18_: Hoping to find F in a calmer mood, I asked her today\r\njust how long she meant by \"a matter of time\"? She shrugged it off. \"Not\r\nmore than four or five months,\" she said blithely.\r\n\r\n\"In a month at most the Grass will be in Britain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let it come,\" she responded callously. \"We shall take the _Sisyphus_\r\nand conclude our work there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But millions will die in the meantime,\" I protested.\r\n\r\nShe turned on me with what I can only describe as tigrish ferocity. \"Did\r\nyou think of the millions you condemned to death when you refused to\r\nsell concentrates to the Asiatic refugees?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I sell to people who couldnt buy?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the millions who died because you refused them employment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I responsible for those too shiftless to fend for themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Am I my brother's keeper?' If fifty million Englishmen die because I\r\ncannot hasten the process of trial and error, the guilt is mine and I\r\nadmit it. I do not seek to exculpate myself by pointing a finger at you\r\nor by silly and pompous evasions of my responsibility. If the Grass\r\ncomes before I am ready, the fault is mine. In the meantime, while one\r\ncreature remains alive, even if his initials be A W, I shall seek to\r\npreserve him. As long as there is a foothold on land I shall try on\r\nland; and when that fails we shall board the _Sisyphus_ and finish our\r\nwork there, somewhere in the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you definitely abandon hope of perfecting your compound before\r\nEngland goes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I abandon nothing,\" she replied. \"I think it's quite possible I'll\r\nfinish in time to save England, but I can't afford to do anything but\r\nlook forward to the worst. And that is that we'll be driven to the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nI was appalled by the picture her words elicited: a few ships containing\r\nthe survivors; a world covered with the Grass.\r\n\r\n\"And when success is attained we shall fight our way back inch by inch.\"\r\n\r\nBut this piece of bombast didnt hearten me. I had no desire to fight our\r\nway back inch by inch; I wanted at least a fragment of civilization\r\nsalvaged.\r\n\r\n_September 19_: F has not been the only one to think of the high seas as\r\na final refuge. The London office has been literally besieged by men of\r\nwealth eager to pay any price to charter one of our ships. I have given\r\norders to grant no more charters for the present.\r\n\r\n_September 20_: The enthusiasm is subsiding and people are beginning to\r\nask how long it will be before they can expect the reconquest of the\r\nContinent to begin. BBC spoke cautiously about \"perfection\" of the\r\ncompound for the first time, opening the way to the implication that it\r\ndoesnt work as yet. Added quite a bit to my manuscript.\r\n\r\n_September 21_: Mrs H, in very dignified mood, approached me; said she\r\nheard I had made plans to leave England in case the Grass threatened.\r\nShe asked nothing for herself, she said, being quite content to accept\r\nwhatever fate Providence had in store for her, but, would I take her\r\ndaughter and family along on the _Sisyphus_? They would be quite useful,\r\nshe added lamely.\r\n\r\nI said I would give the matter my attention, but assured her there was\r\nno immediate danger.\r\n\r\n_September 22_: Grass on the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n_September 23_: Ordered stocking of the _Sisyphus_ with as much\r\nconcentrates as she can carry. The supply will be ample for a full crew,\r\nF's staff and myself for at least six months.\r\n\r\n_September 24_: Ive known for years that F is insane, but her latest\r\nphase is so fantastic and preposterous I can hardly credit it. She\r\ndemands flatly the _Sisyphus_ take along at least fifty \"nubile females\r\nin order to restock the world after its reconquest.\" After catching my\r\nbreath I argued with her. The prospect of England's loss was by no means\r\ncertain yet.\r\n\r\n\"Good. We'll give the girls a seavoyage and land them back safe and\r\nsound.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have enough supplies for six months; if we take along these\r\nsuperfluous passengers our time will be cut to less than three.\"\r\n\r\nHer answer was a brutal piece of blackmail. \"No women, no go.\"\r\n\r\nIf F were a young man instead of an elderly woman I could understand\r\nthis aberration better.\r\n\r\n_September 25_: It seems Mrs H's grandchildren are all girls between\r\ntwelve and eighteen, which leaves the problem of fulfilling F's\r\nultimatum to finding fortyseven others. I have delegated the selection\r\nto Mrs H.\r\n\r\n_September 26_: Grass on Skye for the second time. This invasion was not\r\nrepulsed.\r\n\r\n_September 27_: The cyclone fans have been set up from Moray Firth to\r\nthe Firth of Lorne. I am in two minds about asking the Tharios to join\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe bill authorizing the construction of a vertical city at Stonehenge\r\npassed Commons.\r\n\r\n_September 28_: Grass reported near Aberdeen. Panic in Scotland. No more\r\ntrain service.\r\n\r\n_September 29_: Day of fasting, humiliation and prayer proclaimed by the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury. Grass south of the Dee. All mines shut down.\r\n\r\n_September 30_: Every seaworthy vessel, and many not seaworthy, now\r\nunder charter. I have ordered all remaining stores of concentrates\r\nloaded on our own hulls, to be manned by skeleton crews. They will stand\r\nby the _Sisyphus_ on her voyage. Lack of railway transportation making\r\nthings difficult.\r\n\r\n_October 1_: They have actually broken ground at Stonehenge for Burlet's\r\nfantastic city.\r\n\r\n_October 2_: Wrote on my book for nearly twelve solid hours. The postal\r\nservice has been stopped.\r\n\r\n_October 3_: Hearing the royal family had made no plans for departure,\r\nthe London office ventured to offer them accommodations on one of our\r\nships. I had always heard the House of Windsor was meticulous in its\r\npoliteness, but I cannot characterize their rejection of our wellmeant\r\naid as anything but rude.\r\n\r\n_October 4_: Mrs H asks, Are we to live solely on concentrates now the\r\nshops are shut? My query as to whether this seemed objectionable to her\r\nwas evaded.\r\n\r\n_October 5_: Grass in Inverness and Perthshire.\r\n\r\n_October 6_: F announces she is ready for another test. Under present\r\nconditions, the journey to Scotland being out of the question, we\r\ndecided to use the _Sisyphus_ again and the French coast. Leaving\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\n_October 11_: This constant series of frustrations is beyond endurance.\r\nIn spite of F's noncommittal pessimism anticipating success only after\r\nthe Grass has covered England, I feel she is merely making some sort of\r\npropitiatory gesture when she looks on the darkest side of the picture\r\nthat way. As for myself I'm convinced the Grass will be stopped in a\r\nweek or so. But in the meantime F's work advances by the inch, only to\r\nbe set back again and again.\r\n\r\nWe repeated the previous test with just enough added success to give our\r\nfailure the quality of supreme exasperation. This time there was no\r\nquestion but what the growth sprayed actually withered within twentyfour\r\nhours. But it was not wiped out and not long afterward it was overrun\r\nand covered up by a new and vigorous mass. Such a victory early in the\r\nfight would have meant something; now it is too late for such piecemeal\r\ndestruction. We must have a counteragent which communicates its lethal\r\neffect to a larger area of the Grass than is actually touched by it--or\r\nat very least makes the affected spot untenable for future growth.\r\n\r\nWhat help is it for F to rub her hands smugly and say, \"We're on the\r\nright track, all right\"? Weve been on the right track for months, but\r\nthe train doesnt get anywhere.\r\n\r\n_October 12_: Columbus Day.\r\n\r\n_October 13_: Grass in Fife and Stirling. BBC urges calm.\r\n\r\n_October 14_: Rumor has it work abandoned at Stonehenge. It was a\r\nfutile gesture anyway. I'm sure F will perfect the counteragent anyday.\r\n\r\n_October 15_: Mrs H announced she has completed her selection of fifty\r\nyoung women, adding, \"I hope they will prove satisfactory, sir.\" For a\r\nhorrible moment I wondered if she thought I was arranging for a harem.\r\n\r\n_October 16_: Decided, purely as a matter of convenience and not from\r\npanic, such as is beginning to affect even the traditionally stolid\r\nBritish, to move aboard the _Sisyphus_. Grass on the outskirts of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n_October 17_: In a burst of energy last night I brought my history down\r\nto the Grass in Europe.\r\n\r\nDisconcerting hitch. Most of the _Sisyphus'_ crew, including the\r\ncaptain, want to take their wives along. I find it difficult to believe\r\nthem all uxoriously wed--at any rate this is not a pleasure excursion.\r\nAgreed the captain should take his and told him to effect some\r\ncompromise on the others. The capacity of the _Sisyphus_ is not elastic.\r\n\r\n_October 18_: Grass almost to the Tweed. PM on the wireless with the\r\nassurance a counteragent will be perfected within the week. F furious;\r\nwanted to know if I couldnt control my politicians better. I answered\r\nmeekly--really, her anger was ludicrous--that I was an American citizen,\r\nnot part of the British electorate, and therefore had no influence over\r\nthe prime minister of Great Britain. Seriously, however, perhaps the\r\npremature announcement will spur her on.\r\n\r\nThe erratic phone service finally stopped altogether.\r\n\r\n_October 19_: Riots and looting--unEnglish manifestations carried out in\r\na very English way. Hysterical orators called for the destruction of all\r\nforeign refugees from the Grass, or at very least their exclusion from\r\nthe benefits of the lootings. In every case the mob answered them in\r\nalmost identical language: \"Fair play,\" \"Share and share alike,\" \"Yer\r\nnyme Itler, maybe?\" \"Come orf it, sonny, oo er yew? Gord Orlmighty's\r\nfurriner, aint E?\" Having heckled the speakers, they proceeded\r\ncheerfully to clean out all stocks of available goods--the refugees\r\ngetting their just shares. There must be a peculiar salubrity about the\r\nEnglish air. Otherwise Britons could not act so differently at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nThankful indeed all Consolidated Pemmican stores safely loaded.\r\n\r\n_October 20_: As anticipated, the Grass crossed the Tweed into\r\nNorthumberland, but quite unexpectedly England has also been invaded\r\nfrom another quarter. Norfolk has the Grass from Yarmouth to Cromer. F,\r\nthe PM, and myself hanged in effigy. Shall not tarry much longer.\r\n\r\n_October 21_: Durham and Suffolk. Consulted the captain about a set of\r\nauxiliary sails for the _Sisyphus_. Moving aboard tonight.\r\n\r\n_October 22_: Heard indirectly that the Tharios had managed to charter a\r\nseagoing tug on shares with friends. This takes a great load off my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nPostponed moving to the ship in order to superintend packing of personal\r\npossessions, including the manuscript of my history. F says it is still\r\nnot impossible to perfect compound before the Grass reaches London.\r\n\r\n_October 23_: On board the _Sisyphus_. What has become of the stolid\r\nheroism of the English people? On the way down to the ship, I ran into a\r\ncrowd no better behaved than the adherents of the Republic One and\r\nIndivisible. I mention the episode lightly, but it was no laughing\r\nmatter. I was lucky to escape with my life.\r\n\r\nNervous and upset with the strain. I shall not return to The Ivies till\r\nthe Grass begins its retreat. Too restless to continue my book. Paced\r\nthe deck a long time.\r\n\r\n_October 24_: The fifty girls arrived, and a more maddening cargo I\r\ncan't imagine. I gave orders to keep them forward, but their shrill\r\npresence nevertheless penetrates aft.\r\n\r\nI hear all electricity has been cut off. Grass in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n_October 25_: F came aboard with the other scientists and immediately\r\nwanted to know why we didnt set sail. I asked her if her work could be\r\ncarried on any more easily at sea. She shrugged her shoulders. I pointed\r\nout that only rats leave a sinking ship and England was far from\r\novercome. She favored me with one of her fixed stares.\r\n\r\n\"You are dithery, Weener. Your epigrams have lost their jaunty air of\r\ndiscovery and your face is almost green.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not expect me to remain unaffected by the events around us,\r\nMiss Francis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldnt I?\" she retorted incomprehensibly and went below to her\r\ncabin-laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe Grass is reported in Essex and Hertfordshire. I understand there are\r\nat least two other ships equipped for research and manned by English\r\nscientists. It would serve F right if they perfected a counteragent\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nOctober 26: Have ordered our accompanying ships to lie offshore, lest\r\nthey be boarded by fearcrazed refugees, for the Grass is now in the\r\nvicinity of London and England is in a horrible state.\r\n\r\nOctober 27: BBC transmitting from Penzance. Faint.\r\n\r\n\r\n_101._ _November 3_: On board the _Sisyphus_ off Scilly. The last days\r\nof England have passed. Heightening the horror, the BBC in its final\r\nmoments forwent its policy of soothing its listeners and urging calmness\r\nupon them. Instead, it organized an amazing news service, using\r\nthousands of pigeons carrying messages from eyewitnesses to the station\r\nat Penzance to give a minutebyminute account of the end. Dispassionately\r\nand detachedly, as though this were some ordinary disaster, announcer\r\nafter announcer went on the air and read reports; heartpiercing,\r\nanticlimactic, tragic, trivial, noble and thoroughly English reports....\r\n\r\nThe people vented their futile rage and terror in mass pyromania.\r\nBuilding after building, city after city was burned to the ground. But,\r\naccording to the BBC, the murderous frenzy of the Continent was not\r\nduplicated. Inanimate things suffered; priceless art objects were kicked\r\naround in the streets, but houses were carefully emptied of inhabitants\r\nbefore being put to the torch.\r\n\r\nThese were the spectacular happenings; the emphatic events. Behind them,\r\nand in the majority, were quieter, duller transactions. Churches and\r\nchapels filled with people sitting quiet in pews, meditating; gatherings\r\nin the country, where the participants looked at the sun, earth and sky;\r\nvast meetings in Hyde Park proclaiming the indissoluble brotherhood of\r\nman, even in the face of extinction.\r\n\r\nWe heard the Queen and her consort remained in Buckingham Palace to the\r\nlast, but this may be only romantic rumor. At all events, England is\r\ngone now, after weathering a millennium of unsuccessful invasions. From\r\nwhere I sit peacefully, bringing my history uptodate and jotting these\r\nnotes in my diary, I can see, faintly with the naked eye or quite\r\ndistinctly through a telescope, that emerald gem set in a silver sea.\r\nThe great cities are covered; the barren moors, the lovely lakes, the\r\ngentle streams, the forbidding crags are all mantled in one grassy\r\nsward. England is gone, and with it the world. What few men of\r\nforethought who have taken to ships, what odd survivors there may be in\r\narctic wastes or on lofty Andean or Himalayan peaks, together with the\r\ncomplement of the _Sisyphus_ and its accompanying escort are all that\r\nsurvive of humanity. It is an awesome thought.\r\n\r\n_Later_: Reading this over it seems almost as though I had been untrue\r\nto my fundamental philosophy. The world has gone, vanished; but perhaps\r\nit is for the best, afterall. We shall start again in a few days with a\r\nclean slate, picking up from where we left off--for we have books and\r\ntools and men of learning and intelligence--to start a new and better\r\nworld the moment the Grass retreats. I am heartened by the thought.\r\n\r\nBelow, Miss Francis and her coworkers are striving for the solution.\r\nAfter the last experiment there can be no question as to the outcome. An\r\nhour ago I would have written that it was deplorable this outcome\r\ncouldnt be achieved before the latest victory of the Grass. Now I begin\r\nto believe it may be a lucky delay.\r\n\r\n_November 4_: What meaning have dates now? We shall have to have a new\r\ncalendar--Before the Grass and After the Grass.\r\n\r\n_November 5_: Moved by some incomprehensible morbidity I had a stainless\r\nsteel chest, complete with floats, made before embarkation in order to\r\nplace the manuscript and diary in it should the impossible happen. I\r\nhave it now on the deck beside me as a reminder never to give way to a\r\nweak despair. F promises me it is a matter of days if not hours till we\r\ncan return to our native element.\r\n\r\n_November 8_: Another test. Almost completely successful. F certain the\r\nnext one will do it. My emotions are exhausted.\r\n\r\n_November 9_: I have completed my history of the Grass down to the\r\ncommencement of this diary. I shall take a wellearned rest from my\r\nliterary labors for a few days. F announces a new test--\"the final one,\r\nWeener, the final one\"--for tomorrow.\r\n\r\n_November 10_: Experiment with the now perfected compound has been put\r\noff one more day. F is completely calm and confident of the outcome. She\r\nis below now, making lastminute preparations. For the first time she has\r\ninfected me with her certitude--although I never doubted ultimate\r\nsuccess--and I feel tomorrow will actually see the beginning of the end\r\nfor the Grass which started so long ago on Mrs Dinkman's lawn. How far I\r\nand the world have come since then!\r\n\r\nWould I go back to that day if I had the power? It seems an absurd\r\nquestion, but there is no doubt we who have survived have gained\r\nspiritual stature. Of course I do not mean anything mystical or\r\nsupernatural by this observation--we have acquired heightened\r\nsensitivity and new perceptions. Brother Paul, ridiculous mountebank,\r\nwas yet correct in this--the Grass chastised us rightly. Whatever sins\r\nmankind committed have been wiped out and expiated.\r\n\r\n_Later_: We are out of sight of land; nothing but sea and sky, no green\r\nanywhere. On the eve of liberation all sorts of absurd and irrelevant\r\nthoughts jump about in my mind. The strange lady ... Joe's symphony,\r\nburned by his mother. Whatever happened to William Rufus Le ffaçasé\r\nafter he eschewed his profession for superstition? And Mrs Dinkman? For\r\nsome annoying reason I am beset with the thought of Mrs Dinkman.\r\n\r\nI can see her pincenez illadjusted on her nose. I can hear her\r\nhighpitched complaining voice bargaining with me over the cost of\r\ninoculating her lawn. The ugly stuff of her tasteless dress is before my\r\neyes. It is so real to me I swear I can see the poor, irregular lines of\r\nthe weaving.\r\n\r\n_Still later_: I have sat here in a dull lethargy, undoubtedly induced\r\nby my overwrought state, quite understandable in the light of what is to\r\nhappen in a few hours, my eyes on the seams of the deck, reviewing all\r\nthe things I have written in my book, preparing myself, a way, for the\r\nglorious and triumphant finish. But I am beset by delusions. A moment\r\nago it was the figure of Mrs Dinkman and now--\r\n\r\nAnd now, by all the horror that has overcome mankind, it is a waving,\r\ncreeping, insatiable runner of the Grass.\r\n\r\n_Again_: I have made no attempt to pinch off the green stolon. It must\r\nbe three inches long by now and the slim end is waving in the wind,\r\nseeking for a suitable spot to assure its hold doubly. I touched it with\r\nmy hand, but I could not bring myself to harm it.\r\n\r\nI managed to drag my eyes away from the plant and go below to see Miss\r\nFrancis. I stood outside the cabin for a long time, listening to the\r\nnoise and laughter, coupled with a note of triumph I had never heard\r\nbefore and which I'm sure indicates indubitable success. There can be no\r\nquestion of that.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question of that.\r\n\r\nThe stolon has pressed itself into another seam.\r\n\r\nThe blades are very green. They have opened themselves to the sun and\r\nare sucking strength for the new shoots. I have put my manuscript into\r\nthe casket which floats, leaving it open for this diary if it should be\r\nnecessary. But of course such a contingency is absurd.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely absurd.\r\n\r\nThe Grass has found another seam in the deck.",
