Donnelly, \"hopes for oneself get more\r\nmoderate, and I shall be content if next year is no worse than the\r\nlast. Blessed are the poor in spirit!\" [The good effects of the visit\r\nto Arolla had not outlasted the winter, and from the end of February he\r\nwas obliged to alternate between London and the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he managed to attend to a good deal of business in the\r\nintervals between his periodic flights to the country, for he continued\r\nto serve on the Royal Society Council, to do some of the examining work\r\nat South Kensington, and to fight for the establishment of adequate\r\nTechnical Education in England. He attended the Senate and various\r\ncommittees of the London University and of the Marine Biological\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters refer to the proposal--it was the Jubilee year--to\r\ncommemorate the occasion by the establishment of the Imperial\r\nInstitute. To this he gladly gave his support; not indeed to the merely\r\nsocial side; but in the opportunity of organising the practical\r\napplications of science to industry he saw the key to success in the\r\nindustrial war of the future. Seconding the resolution proposed by Lord\r\nRothschild at the Mansion House meeting on January 12, he spoke of the\r\nrelation of industry to science--the two great developments of this\r\ncentury. Formerly practical men looked askance at science, \"but within\r\nthe last thirty years, more particularly,\" continues the report in\r\n\"Nature\" (volume 33 page 265) \"that state of things had entirely\r\nchanged. There began in the first place a slight flirtation between\r\nscience and industry, and that flirtation had grown into an intimacy,\r\nhe must almost say courtship, until those who watched the signs of the\r\ntimes saw that it was high time that the young people married and set\r\nup an establishment for themselves. This great scheme, from his point\r\nof view, was the public and ceremonial marriage of science and\r\nindustry.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding to speak of the contrast between militarism and\r\nindustrialism, he asked whether, after all, modern industry was not war\r\nunder the forms of peace. The difference was the difference between\r\nmodern and ancient war, consisting in the use of scientific weapons, of\r\norganisation and information. The country, he concluded, had dropped\r\nastern in the race for want of special education which was obtained\r\nelsewhere by the artisan. The only possible chance for keeping the\r\nindustry of England at the head of the world was through organisation.\r\n\r\nWriting on January 18, to Mr. Herbert Spencer, who had sent him some\r\nproofs of his Autobiography to look through, he says:--]\r\n\r\nI see that your proofs have been in my hands longer than I thought for.\r\nBut you may have seen that I have been \"starring\" at the Mansion House.\r\n\r\nThis was not exactly one of those bits of over-easiness to pressure\r\nwith which you reproach me--but the resultant of a composition of\r\npressures, one of which was the conviction that the \"Institute\" might\r\nbe made into something very useful and greatly wanted--if only the\r\nprojectors could be made to believe that they had always intended to do\r\nthat which your humble servant wants done--that is the establishment of\r\na sort of Royal Society for the improvement of industrial knowledge and\r\nan industrial university--by voluntary association.\r\n\r\nI hope my virtue may be its own reward. For except being knocked up for\r\na day or two by the unwonted effort, I doubt whether there will be any\r\nother. The thing has fallen flat as a pancake, and I greatly doubt\r\nwhether any good will come of it. Except a fine in the shape of a\r\nsubscription, I hope to escape further punishment for my efforts to be\r\nof use.\r\n\r\n[However, this was only the beginning of his campaign.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, a letter from him appeared in the \"Times,\" guarding\r\nagainst a wrong interpretation of his speech, in the general\r\nuncertainty as to the intentions of the proposers of the scheme.]\r\n\r\nI had no intention [he writes] of expressing any enthusiasm on behalf\r\nof the establishment of a vast permanent bazaar. I am not competent to\r\nestimate the real utility of these great shows. What I do see very\r\nclearly is that they involve difficulties of site, huge working\r\nexpenses, the potentiality of endless squabbles, and apparently the\r\ncheapening of knighthood.\r\n\r\n[As for the site proposed at South Kensington,] \"the arguments used in\r\nits favour in the report would be conclusive if the dry light of reason\r\nwere the sole guide of human action.\" [But it would alienate other\r\npowerful and wealthy bodies, which were interested in the Central\r\nInstitute of the City and Guilds Technical Institute,] \"which looks so\r\nportly outside and is so very much starved inside.\"\r\n\r\n[He wrote again to the \"Times\" on March 21:--]\r\n\r\nThe Central Institute is undoubtedly a splendid monument of the\r\nmunificence of the city. But munificence without method may arrive at\r\nresults indistinguishably similar to those of stinginess. I have been\r\nblamed for saying that the Central Institute is \"starved.\" Yet a man\r\nwho has only half as much food as he needs is indubitably starved, even\r\nthough his short rations consist of ortolans and are served upon gold\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n[Only half the plan of operations as drawn up by the Committee was, or\r\ncould be, carried out on existing funds.\r\n\r\nThe later part of his letter was printed by the Committee as defining\r\nthe functions of the new Institute:--]\r\n\r\nThat with which I did intend to express my strong sympathy was the\r\nintention which I thought I discerned to establish something which\r\nshould play the same part in regard to the advancement of industrial\r\nknowledge which has been played in regard to science and learning in\r\ngeneral, in these realms, by the Royal Society and the Universities...I\r\npictured the Imperial Institute to myself as a house of call for all\r\nthose who are concerned in the advancement of industry; as a place in\r\nwhich the home-keeping industrial could find out all he wants to know\r\nabout colonial industry and the colonist about home industry; as a sort\r\nof neutral ground on which the capitalist and the artisan would be\r\nequally welcome; as a centre of intercommunication in which they might\r\nenter into friendly discussion of the problems at issue between them,\r\nand, perchance, arrive at a friendly solution of them. I imagined it a\r\nplace in which the fullest stores of industrial knowledge would be made\r\naccessible to the public; in which the higher questions of commerce and\r\nindustry would be systematically studied and elucidated; and where, as\r\nin an industrial university, the whole technical education of the\r\ncountry might find its centre and crown. If I earnestly desire to see\r\nsuch an institution created, it is not because I think that or anything\r\nelse will put an end to pauperism and want--as somebody has absurdly\r\nsuggested,--but because I believe it will supply a foundation for that\r\nscientific organisation of our industries which the changed conditions\r\nof the times render indispensable to their prosperity. I do not think I\r\nam far wrong in assuming that we are entering, indeed, have already\r\nentered, upon the most serious struggle for existence to which this\r\ncountry has ever been committed. The latter years of the century\r\npromise to see us embarked in an industrial war of far more serious\r\nimport than the military wars of its opening years. On the east, the\r\nmost systematically instructed and best-informed people in Europe are\r\nour competitors; on the west, an energetic offshoot of our own stock,\r\ngrown bigger than its parent, enters upon the struggle possessed of\r\nnatural resources to which we can make no pretension, and with every\r\nprospect of soon possessing that cheap labour by which they may be\r\neffectually utilised. Many circumstances tend to justify the hope that\r\nwe may hold our own if we are careful to \"organise victory.\" But to\r\nthose who reflect seriously on the prospects of the population of\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire--should the time ever arrive when the goods\r\nwhich are produced by their labour and their skill are to be had\r\ncheaper elsewhere--to those who remember the cotton famine and reflect\r\nhow much worse a customer famine would be, the situation appears very\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n[On February 19 and 22, he wrote again to the \"Times\" declaring against\r\nthe South Kensington site. It was too far from the heart of commercial\r\norganisation in the city, and the city people were preparing to found a\r\nsimilar institution of their own. He therefore wished to prevent the\r\nImperial Institute from becoming a weak and unworthy memorial of the\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nA final letter to the \"Times\" on March 21, was evoked by the fact that\r\nLord Hartington, in giving away the prizes at the Polytechnic Y.M.C.A.,\r\nhad adopted Huxley's position as defined in his speech, and declared\r\nthat science ought to be aided on precisely the same grounds on which\r\nwe aid the army and navy.\r\n\r\nIn this letter he asks, how do we stand prepared for the task thus\r\nimperatively set us? We have the machinery for providing instruction\r\nand information, and for catching capable men, but both in a disjointed\r\ncondition]--\"all mere torsos--fine, but fragmentary.\" \"The ladder from\r\nthe School Board to the Universities, about which I dreamed dreams many\r\nyears ago, has not yet acquired much more substantiality than the\r\nladder of Jacob's vision,\" [but the Science and Art Department, the\r\nNormal School of Science, and the Central Institute only want the means\r\nto carry out the recommendations already made by impartial and\r\nindependent authority.] \"Economy does not lie in sparing money, but in\r\nspending it wisely.\"\r\n\r\n[He concluded with an appeal to Lord Hartington to take up this task of\r\norganising industrial education and bring it to a happy issue.\r\n\r\nA proposal was also made to the Royal Society to co-operate, and Sir M.\r\nFoster writes on February 19: \"We have appointed a Committee to\r\nconsider and draw up a draft reply with a view of the Royal Society\r\nfollowing up your letter.\"\r\n\r\nTo this Huxley replied on the 22nd:--]\r\n\r\n...My opinion is that the Royal Society has no right to spend its money\r\nor pledge its credit for any but scientific objects, and that we have\r\nnothing to do with sending round the hat for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe project of the Institute Committee as it stands connected with the\r\nSouth Kensington site--is condemned by all the city people and will\r\nreceive none but the most grudging support from them. They are going to\r\nset up what will be practically an Institute of their own in the city.\r\n\r\nThe thing is already a failure. I daresay it will go on and be\r\nvarnished into a simulacrum of success--to become eventually a ghost\r\nlike the Albert Hall or revive as a tea garden.\r\n\r\n[The following letter also touches upon the function of the Institute\r\nfrom the commercial side:--]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, February 20, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nMr. Law's suggestion gives admirable definition to the notions that\r\nwere floating in my mind when I wrote in my letter to the \"Times\", that\r\nI imagined the Institute would be a \"place in which the fullest stores\r\nof industrial knowledge would be made accessible to the public.\" A man\r\nof business who wants to know anything about the prospects of trade\r\nwith, say, Boorioboola-Gha (vide Bleak House) ought to be able to look\r\ninto the Institute and find there somebody who will at once fish out\r\nfor him among the documents in the place all that is known about\r\nBoorioboola.\r\n\r\nBut a Commercial Intelligence Department is not all that is wanted,\r\nvide valuable letter aforesaid.\r\n\r\nI hope your appetite for the breakfast was none the worse for last\r\nnight's doings--mine was rather improved, but I am dog-tired.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI return Miss --'s note. she evidently thinks my cage is labelled\r\n\"These animals bite.\"\r\n\r\n[Later in the year, the following letters show him continuing the\r\ncampaign. But an attack of pleurisy, which began the very day of the\r\nJubilee, prevented him from coming to speak at a meeting upon Technical\r\nEducation. In the autumn, however, he spoke on the subject at\r\nManchester, and had the satisfaction of seeing the city \"go solid,\" as\r\nhe expressed it, for technical education. The circumstances of this\r\nvisit are given later.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 1, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Roscoe,\r\n\r\nI met Lord Hartington at the Academy Dinner last night and took the\r\nopportunity of urging upon him the importance of following up his\r\ntechnical education speech. He told me he had been in communication\r\nwith you about the matter, and he seemed to me to be very well disposed\r\nto your plans.\r\n\r\nI may go on crying in the wilderness until I am hoarse, with no result,\r\nbut if he and you and Mundella will take it up, something may be done.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 28, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Roscoe,\r\n\r\nDonnelly was here on Sunday and was quite right up to date. I felt I\r\nought to be better, and could not make out why the deuce I was not.\r\nYesterday the mischief came out. There is a touch of pleurisy--which\r\nhas been covered by the muscular rheumatism.\r\n\r\nSo I am relegated to bed and told to stop there--with the company of\r\ncataplasms to keep me lively.\r\n\r\nI do not think the attack in any way serious--but M. Pl. is a gentleman\r\nnot to be trifled with, when you are over sixty, and there is nothing\r\nfor it but to obey my doctor's orders.\r\n\r\nPray do not suppose I would be stopped by a trifle, if my coming to the\r\nmeeting [Of July 1, on Technical Education.] would really have been of\r\nuse. I hope you will say how grieved I am to be absent.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 29, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Roscoe,\r\n\r\nI have scrawled a variety of comments on the paper you sent me. Deal\r\nwith them as you think fit.\r\n\r\nEver since I was on the London School Board I have seen that the key of\r\nthe position is in the Sectarian Training Colleges and that wretched\r\nimposture, the pupil teacher system. As to the former Delendae sunt no\r\ntruce or pact to be made with them, either Church or Dissenting. Half\r\nthe time of their students is occupied with grinding into their minds\r\ntheir tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee theological idiocies, and the other\r\nhalf in cramming them with boluses of other things to be duly spat out\r\non examination day. Whatever is done do not let us be deluded by any\r\npromises of theirs to hook on science or technical teaching to their\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\nI am greatly disgusted that I cannot come to Tyndall's dinner\r\nto-night--but my brother-in-law's death would have stopped me (the\r\nfuneral to-day)--even if my doctor had not forbidden me to leave my\r\nbed. He says I have some pleuritic effusion on one side and must mind\r\nmy P's and Q's.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A good deal of correspondence at this time with Sir M. Foster relates\r\nto the examinations of the Science and Art Department. He was still\r\nDean, it will be remembered, of the Royal College of Science, and\r\nfurther kept up his connection with the Department by acting in an\r\nhonorary capacity as Examiner, setting questions, but less and less\r\nlooking over papers, acting as the channel for official communications,\r\nas when he writes (April 24),] \"I send you some Department\r\ndocuments--nothing alarming, only more worry for the Assistant\r\nExaminers, and that WE do not mind\"; and finally signing the Report.\r\nBut to do this after taking so small a share in the actual work of\r\nexamining, grew more and more repugnant to him, till on October 12 he\r\nwrites:--]\r\n\r\nI will read the Report and sign it if need be--though there really must\r\nbe some fresh arrangement.\r\n\r\nOf course I have entire confidence in your judgment about the\r\nexamination, but I have a mortal horror of putting my name to things I\r\ndo not know of my own knowledge.\r\n\r\n[In addition to these occupations, he wrote a short paper upon a\r\nfossil, Ceratochelys, which was read at the Royal Society on March 31;\r\nwhile on April 7 he read at the Linnean (\"Botany\" volume 24 pages\r\n101-124), his paper, \"The Gentians: Notes and Queries,\" which had\r\nsprung from his holiday amusement at Arolla.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy, however, claimed most of his energies. The campaign begun\r\nin answer to the incursion of Mr. Lilly was continued in the article\r\n\"Science and Pseudo-Scientific Realism\" (\"Collected Essays\" 5 59-89)\r\nwhich appeared in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for February 1887. The text\r\nfor this discourse was the report of a sermon by Canon Liddon, in which\r\nthat eminent preacher spoke of catastrophes as the antithesis of\r\nphysical law, yet possible inasmuch as a \"lower law\" may be \"suspended\"\r\nby the \"intervention of a higher,\" a mode of reasoning which he applied\r\nto the possibility of miracles such as that of Cana.\r\n\r\nThe man of science was up in arms against this incarnation of abstract\r\nterms, and offered a solemn protest against that modern recrudescence\r\nof ancient realism which speaks of \"laws of nature\" as though they were\r\nindependent entities, agents, and efficient causes of that which\r\nhappens, instead of simply our name for observed successions of facts.\r\n\r\nCarefully as all personalities had been avoided in this article, it\r\ncalled forth a lively reply from the Duke of Argyll, rebuking him for\r\nventuring to criticise the preacher, whose name was now brought forward\r\nfor the first time, and raising a number of other questions,\r\nphilosophical, geological, and biological, to which Huxley rejoined\r\nwith some selections from the authentic history of these points in\r\n\"Science and Pseudo-Science\" (\"Nineteenth Century\" April 1887,\r\n\"Collected Essays\" 5 90-125).\r\n\r\nMoreover, judging from the vivacity of the duke's reply that some of\r\nthe shafts of the first article must have struck nearer home than the\r\npulpit of St. Paul's, he was induced to read \"The Reign of Law,\" the\r\nsecond chapter of which, dealing with the nature of \"Law,\" he now\r\ncriticised sharply as] \"a sort of 'summa' of pseudo-scientific\r\nphilosophy,\" [with its confusions of law and necessity, law and force,]\r\n\"law in the sense, not merely of a rule, but of a cause.\" [(Cf. his\r\ntreatment of the subject 24 years before, volume 1.)\r\n\r\nHe wound up with some banter upon the Duke's picture of a scientific\r\nReign of Terror, whereby, it seemed, all men of science were compelled\r\nto accept the Darwinian faith, and against which Huxley himself was\r\npreparing to rebel, as if:--]\r\n\r\nForsooth, I am supposed to be waiting for the signal of \"revolt,\" which\r\nsome fiery spirits among these young men are to raise before I dare\r\nexpress my real opinions concerning questions about which we older men\r\nhad to fight in the teeth of fierce public opposition and obloquy--of\r\nsomething which might almost justify even the grandiloquent epithet of\r\na Reign of Terror--before our excellent successors had left school.\r\n\r\n[Here for a while the debate ceased. But in the September number of the\r\n\"Nineteenth Century\" the Duke of Argyll returned to the fray with an\r\narticle called \"A Great Lesson,\" in which he attempted to offer\r\nevidence in support of his assertions concerning the scientific reign\r\nof terror. The two chief pieces of evidence adduced were Bathybius and\r\nDr. (now Sir J.) Murray's theory of coral reefs. The former was\r\ninstanced as a blunder due to the desire of finding support for the\r\nDarwinian theory in the existence of this widespread primordial life;\r\nthe latter as a case in which a new theory had been systematically\r\nburked, for fear of damaging the infallibility of Darwin, who had\r\npropounded a different theory of coral reefs!\r\n\r\nHuxley's reply to this was contained in the latter half of an article\r\nwhich appeared in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for November 1887, under the\r\ntitle of \"Science and the Bishops\" (reprinted both in \"Controverted\r\nQuestions\" and in the \"Collected Essays\" 5 126, as \"An Episcopal\r\nTrilogy\"). Preaching at Manchester this autumn, during the meeting of\r\nthe British Association, the Bishops of Carlisle, Bedford, and\r\nManchester had spoken of science not only with knowledge, but in the\r\nspirit of equity and generosity.] \"These sermons,\" [he exclaims,] \"are\r\nwhat the Germans call Epochemachend!\"\r\n\r\nHow often was it my fate [he continues], a quarter of a century ago, to\r\nsee the whole artillery of the pulpit brought to bear upon the doctrine\r\nof evolution and its supporters! Any one unaccustomed to the amenities\r\nof ecclesiastical controversy would have thought we were too wicked to\r\nbe permitted to live.\r\n\r\n[After thus welcoming these episcopal advances, he once more repudiated\r\nthe a priori argument against the efficacy of prayer, the theme of one\r\nof the three sermons, and then proceeded to discuss another sermon of a\r\ndignitary of the Church, which had been sent to him by an unknown\r\ncorrespondent, for] \"there seems to be an impression abroad--I do not\r\ndesire to give any countenance to it--that I am fond of reading\r\nsermons.\"\r\n\r\n[Now this preacher was of a very different mind from the three bishops.\r\nInstead of dwelling upon the \"supreme importance of the purely\r\nspiritual in our faith,\" he warned his hearers against dropping off any\r\nof the miraculous integument of their religion. \"Christianity is\r\nessentially miraculous, and falls to the ground if miracles be\r\nimpossible.\" He was uncompromisingly opposed to any accommodation with\r\nadvancing knowledge, or with the high standard of veracity, enforced by\r\nthe nature of their pursuits, in which Huxley found the only difference\r\nbetween scientific men and any other class of the community.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely this misrepresentation of science on its\r\nspeculative side which Huxley deplored; he was roused to indignation by\r\nan attack on its morality. The preacher reiterated the charge brought\r\nforward in the \"Great Lesson,\" that Dr. Murray's theory of coral reefs\r\nhad been actually suppressed for two years, and that by the advice of\r\nthose who accepted it, for fear of upsetting the infallibility of the\r\ngreat master.\r\n\r\nHereupon he turned in downright earnest upon the originator of the\r\nassertion, who, he considered, had no more than the amateur's knowledge\r\nof the subject. A plain statement of the facts was refutation enough.\r\nThe new theories, he pointed out, had been widely discussed; they had\r\nbeen adopted by some geologists, although Darwin himself had not been\r\nconverted, and after careful and prolonged re-examination of the\r\nquestion, Professor Dana, the greatest living authority on coral reefs,\r\nhad rejected them. As Professor Judd said, \"If this be a 'conspiracy of\r\nsilence,' where, alas! can the geological speculator seek for fame?\"\r\nAny warning not to publish in haste was but advice to a still unknown\r\nman not to attack a seemingly well-established theory without making\r\nsure of his ground. (Letter in \"Nature.\")\r\n\r\nAs for the Bathybius myth, Huxley pointed out that his announcement of\r\nthe discovery had been simply a statement of the actual facts, and that\r\nso far from seeing in it a confirmation of Darwinian hypotheses, he was\r\ncareful to warn his readers] \"to keep the questions of fact and the\r\nquestions of interpretation well apart.\" \"That which interested me in\r\nthe matter,\" he says, \"was the apparent analogy of Bathybius with other\r\nwell-known forms of lower life,\"...\"if Bathybius were brought up alive\r\nfrom the bottom of the Atlantic to-morrow, the fact would not have the\r\nslightest bearing, that I can discern, upon Mr. Darwin's speculations,\r\nor upon any of the disputed problems of biology.\" [And as for his]\r\n\"eating the leek\" [afterwards, his ironical account of it is an\r\ninstance of how the adoption of a plain, straightforward course can be\r\ndescribed without egotism.]\r\n\r\nThe most considerable difference I note among men [he concludes] is not\r\nin their readiness to fall into error, but in their readiness to\r\nacknowledge these inevitable lapses.\r\n\r\n[As the Duke in a subsequent article did not unequivocally withdraw his\r\nstatements, Huxley declined to continue public controversy with him.\r\n\r\nThree years later, writing (October 10, 1890) to Sir J. Donnelly\r\napropos of an article by Mr. Mallock in the \"Nineteenth Century,\" which\r\nmade use of the \"Bathybius myth,\" he says:--]\r\n\r\nBathybius is far too convenient a stick to beat this dog with to be\r\never given up, however many lies may be needful to make the weapon\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nI told the whole story in my reply to the Duke of Argyll, but of course\r\nthe pack give tongue just as loudly as ever. Clerically-minded people\r\ncannot be accurate, even the liberals.\r\n\r\n[I give here the letter sent to the \"unknown correspondent\" in\r\nquestion, who had called his attention to the fourth of these sermons.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, September 30, 1887.\r\n\r\nI have but just returned to England after two months' absence, and in\r\nthe course of clearing off a vast accumulation of letters, I have come\r\nupon yours.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll has been making capital out of the same\r\ncircumstances as those referred to by the Bishop. I believe that the\r\ninterpretation put upon the facts by both is wholly misleading and\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\nIt is quite preposterous to suppose that the men of science of this or\r\nany other country have the slightest disposition to support any view\r\nwhich may have been enunciated by one of their colleagues, however\r\ndistinguished, if good grounds are shown for believing it to be\r\nerroneous.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Murray arrived at his conclusions I have no doubt he was\r\nadvised to make his ground sure before he attacked a generalisation\r\nwhich appeared so well founded as that of Mr. Darwin respecting coral\r\nreefs.\r\n\r\nIf he had consulted me I should have given him that advice myself, for\r\nhis own sake. And whoever advised him, in that sense, in my opinion did\r\nwisely.\r\n\r\nBut the theologians cannot get it out of their heads, that as they have\r\ncreeds, to which they must stick at all hazards, so have the men of\r\nscience. There is no more ridiculous delusion. We, at any rate, hold\r\nourselves morally bound to \"try all things and hold fast to that which\r\nis good\"; and among public benefactors, we reckon him who explodes old\r\nerror, as next in rank to him who discovers new truth.\r\n\r\nYou are at liberty to make any use you please of this letter.\r\n\r\n[Two letters on kindred subjects may appropriately follow in this\r\nplace. Thanking M. Henri Gadeau de Kerville for his \"Causeries sur le\r\nTransformisme,\" he writes (February 1):--]\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nAccept my best thanks for your interesting \"causeries,\" which seem to\r\nme to give a very clear view of the present state of the evolution\r\ndoctrine as applied to biology.\r\n\r\nThere is a statement on page 87 \"Apres sa mort Lamarck fut completement\r\noublie,\" which may be true for France but certainly is not so for\r\nEngland. From 1830 onwards for more than forty years Lyell's\r\n\"Principles of Geology\" was one of the most widely read scientific\r\nbooks in this country, and it contains an elaborate criticism of\r\nLamarck's views. Moreover, they were largely debated during the\r\ncontroversies which arose out of the publication of the \"Vestiges of\r\nCreation\" in 1844 or thereabouts. We are certainly not guilty of any\r\nneglect of Lamarck on this side of the Channel.\r\n\r\nIf I may make another criticism it is that, to my mind, atheism is, on\r\npurely philosophical grounds, untenable. That there is no evidence of\r\nthe existence of such a being as the God of the theologians is true\r\nenough; but strictly scientific reasoning can take us no further. Where\r\nwe know nothing we can neither affirm nor deny with propriety.\r\n\r\n[The other is in answer to the Bishop of Ripon, enclosing a few lines\r\non the principal representatives of modern science, which he had asked\r\nfor.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 16, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Bishop of Ripon,\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad if I can be of any use to you now and always. But\r\nit is not an easy task to put into half-a-dozen sentences, up to the\r\nlevel of your vigorous English, a statement that shall be unassailable\r\nfrom the point of view of a scientific fault-finder--which shall be\r\nintelligible to the general public and yet accurate.\r\n\r\nI have made several attempts and enclose the final result. I think the\r\nsubstance is all right, and though the form might certainly be\r\nimproved, I leave that to you. When I get to a certain point of\r\ntinkering my phrases I have to put them aside for a day or two.\r\n\r\nWill you allow me to suggest that it might be better not to name any\r\nliving man? The temple of modern science has been the work of many\r\nlabourers not only in our own but in other countries. Some have been\r\nmore busy in shaping and laying the stones, some in keeping off the\r\nSanballats, some prophetwise in indicating the course of the science of\r\nthe future. It would be hard to say who has done best service. As\r\nregards Dr. Joule, for example, no doubt he did more than any one to\r\ngive the doctrine of the conservation of energy precise expression, but\r\nMayer and others run him hard.\r\n\r\nOf deceased Englishmen who belong to the first half of the Victorian\r\nepoch, I should say that Faraday, Lyell, and Darwin had exerted the\r\ngreatest influence, and all three were models of the highest and best\r\nclass of physical philosophers.\r\n\r\nAs for me, in part from force of circumstance and in part from a\r\nconviction I could be of most use in that way, I have played the part\r\nof something between maid-of-all-work and gladiator-general for\r\nScience, and deserve no such prominence as your kindness has assigned\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nWith our united kind regards to Mrs. Carpenter and yourself, ever yours\r\nvery faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A brief note, also, to Lady Welby, dated July 25, is characteristic of\r\nhis attitude towards unverified speculation.]\r\n\r\nI have looked through the paper you have sent me, but I cannot\r\nundertake to give any judgment upon it. Speculations such as you deal\r\nwith are quite out of my way. I get lost the moment I lose touch of\r\nvalid fact and incontrovertible demonstration and find myself wandering\r\namong large propositions, which may be quite true but which would\r\ninvolve me in months of work if I were to set myself seriously to find\r\nout whether, and in what sense, they are true. Moreover, at present,\r\nwhat little energy I possess is mortgaged to quite other occupations.\r\n\r\n[The following letter was in answer to a request which I was\r\ncommissioned to forward him, that he would consent to serve on an\r\nhonorary committee of the Societe des Professeurs de Francais en\r\nAngleterre.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 17, 1887.\r\n\r\nI quite forgot to say anything about the Comite d'honneur, and as you\r\njustly remark in the present strained state of foreign politics the\r\nconsequences may be serious. Please tell your colleague that I shall be\r\n\"proud an' 'appy.\" You need not tell him that my pride and happiness\r\nare contingent on having nothing to do for the honour.\r\n\r\n[In the meantime, the ups and downs of his health are reflected in\r\nvarious letters of these six months. Much set up by his stay in the\r\nIsle of Wight, he writes from Shanklin on April 11 to Sir E. Frankland,\r\ndescribing the last meeting of the x Club, which the latter had not\r\nbeen able to attend, as he was staying in the Riviera:--]\r\n\r\nHooker, Tyndall, and I alone turned up last Thursday. Lubbock had gone\r\nto High Elms about used up by the House of Commons, and there was no\r\nsign of Hirst.\r\n\r\nTyndall seemed quite himself again. In fact, we three old fogies voted\r\nunanimously that we were ready to pit ourselves against any three\r\nyoungsters of the present generation in walking, climbing, or\r\nhead-work, and give them odds.\r\n\r\nI hope you are in the same comfortable frame of mind.\r\n\r\nI had no notion that Mentone had suffered so seriously in the\r\nearthquake of 1887. Moral for architects: read your Bible and build\r\nyour house upon the rock.\r\n\r\nThe sky and sea here may be fairly matched against Mentone or any other\r\nof your Mediterranean places. Also the east wind, which has been\r\nblowing steadily for ten days, and is nearly as keen as the Tramontana.\r\nOnly in consequence of the long cold and drought not a leaf is out.\r\n\r\n[Shanklin, indeed, suited him so well that he had half a mind to settle\r\nthere.] \"There are plenty of sites for building,\" [he writes home in\r\nFebruary,] \"but I have not thought of commencing a house yet.\"\r\n[However, he gave up the idea; Shanklin was too far from town.\r\n\r\nBut though he was well enough as long as he kept out of London, a\r\nreturn to his life there was not possible for any considerable time. On\r\nMay 19, just before a visit to Mr. F. Darwin at Cambridge, I find that\r\nhe went down to St. Albans for a couple of days, to walk; and on the\r\n27th he betook himself, terribly ill and broken down, to the Savernake\r\nForest Hotel, in hopes of getting] \"screwed up.\" [This] \"turned out a\r\ncapital speculation, a charming spick-and-span little country hostelry\r\nwith great trees in front.\" [But the weather was persistently bad,]\r\n\"the screws got looser rather than tighter,\" [and again he was\r\ncompelled to stay away from the x.\r\n\r\nA week later, however, he writes:--]\r\n\r\nThe weather has been detestable, and I got no good till yesterday,\r\nwhich was happily fine. Ditto to-day, so I am picking up, and shall\r\nreturn to-morrow, as, like an idiot as I am, I promised to take the\r\nchair at a public meeting about a Free Library for Marylebone on\r\nTuesday evening.\r\n\r\nI wonder if you know this country. I find it charming.\r\n\r\n[On the same day as that which was fixed for the meeting in favour of\r\nthe Free Library, he had a very interesting interview with the Premier,\r\nof which he left the following notes, written at the Athenaeum\r\nimmediately after:--]\r\n\r\nJune 7, 1887.\r\n\r\nCalled on Lord Salisbury by appointment at 3 p.m., and had twenty\r\nminutes' talk with him about the \"matter of some public interest\"\r\nmentioned in his letter of the [29th].\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be a proposal for the formal recognition of\r\ndistinguished services in Science, Letters, and Art by the institution\r\nof some sort of order analogous to the Pour le Merite. Lord Salisbury\r\nspoke of the anomalous present mode of distributing honours, intimated\r\nthat the Queen desired to establish a better system, and asked my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nI said that I should like to separate my personal opinion from that\r\nwhich I believed to obtain among the majority of scientific men; that I\r\nthought many of the latter were much discontented with the present\r\nstate of affairs, and would highly approve of such a proposal as Lord\r\nSalisbury shadowed forth.\r\n\r\nThat, so far as my own personal feeling was concerned, it was opposed\r\nto anything of the kind for Science. I said that in Science we had two\r\nadvantages--first, that a man's work is demonstrably either good or\r\nbad; and secondly, that the \"contemporary posterity\" of foreigners\r\njudges us, and rewards good work by membership of Academies and so\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nIn Art, if a man chooses to call Raphael a dauber, you can't prove he\r\nis wrong; and literary work is just as hard to judge.\r\n\r\nI then spoke of the dangers to which science is exposed by the undue\r\nprominence and weight of men who successfully apply scientific\r\nknowledge to practical purposes--engineers, chemical inventors, etc.,\r\netc.; said it appeared to me that a Minister having such order at his\r\ndisposal would find it very difficult to resist the pressure brought by\r\nsuch people as against the man of high science who had not happened to\r\nhave done anything to strike the popular mind.\r\n\r\nDiscussed the possibility of submission of names by somebody for the\r\napproval and choice of the Crown. For Science, I thought the Royal\r\nSociety Council might discharge that duty very fairly. I thought that\r\nthe Academy of Berlin presented people for the Pour le Merite, but Lord\r\nSalisbury thought not.\r\n\r\nIn the course of conversation I spoke of Hooker's case as a glaring\r\nexample of the wrong way of treating distinguished men. Observed that\r\nthough I did not personally care for or desire the institution of such\r\nhonorary order, yet I thought it was a mistake in policy for the Crown\r\nas the fountain of honour to fail in recognition of that which deserves\r\nhonour in the world of Science, Letters, and Art.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury smilingly summed up. \"Well, it seems that you don't\r\ndesire the establishment of such an order, but that if you were in my\r\nplace you would establish it,\" to which I assented.\r\n\r\nSaid he had spoken to Leighton, who thought well of the project.\r\n\r\n[It was not long, however, before he received imperative notice to quit\r\ntown with all celerity. He fell ill with what turned out to be\r\npleurisy; and after recruiting at Ilkley, went again to Switzerland.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 27, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\n...I am very sorry that it will be impossible for me to attend [the\r\nmeeting of committee down for the following Wednesday]. If I am well\r\nenough to leave the house I must go into the country that day to attend\r\nthe funeral of my wife's brother-in-law and my very old friend Fanning,\r\nof whom I may have spoken to you. He has been slowly sinking for some\r\ntime, and this morning we had news of his death.\r\n\r\nThings have been very crooked for me lately. I had a conglomerate of\r\nengagements of various degrees of importance in the latter half of last\r\nweek, and had to forgo them all, by reason of a devil in the shape of\r\nmuscular rheumatism of one side, which entered me last Wednesday, and\r\nrefuses to be wholly exorcised (I believe it is my Jubilee Honour).\r\n[(On the same day he describes this to Sir J. Evans:--] \"I have hardly\r\nbeen out of the house as far as my garden, and not much off my bed or\r\nsofa since I saw you last. I have had an affection of the muscles of\r\none side of my body, the proper name of which I do not know, but the\r\nsimilitude thereof is a bird of prey periodically digging in his claws\r\nand stopping your breath in a playful way.\") Along with it, and I\r\nsuppose the cause of it, a regular liver upset. I am very seedy yet,\r\nand even if Fanning's death had not occurred I doubt if I should have\r\nbeen ready to face the Tyndall dinner.\r\n\r\n[The reference to this \"Tyndall dinner\" is explained in the following\r\nletters, which also refer to a meeting of the London University, in\r\nwhich the projects of reform which he himself supported met with a\r\nsmart rebuff.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 13, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear of your gout, but they say when it comes out at\r\nthe toes it flies from the better parts, and that is to the good.\r\n\r\nThere is no sort of reason why unsatisfied curiosity should continue to\r\ndisturb your domestic hearth; your wife will have the gout too if it\r\ngoes on. \"They\" can't bear the strain.\r\n\r\nThe history of the whole business is this. A day or two before I spoke\r\nto you, Lockyer told me that various people had been talking about the\r\npropriety of recognising your life-long work in some way or other;\r\nthat, as you would not have anything else, a dinner had been suggested,\r\nand finally asked me to inquire whether you would accept that\r\nexpression of goodwill. Of course I said I would, and I asked\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nAfter you had assented I spoke to several of our friends who were at\r\nthe Athenaeum, and wrote to Lockyer. I believe a strong committee is\r\nforming, and that we shall have a scientific jubilation on a large\r\nscale; but I have purposely kept in the background, and confined\r\nmyself, like Bismarck, to the business of \"honest broker.\"\r\n\r\nBut of course nothing (beyond preliminaries) can be done till you name\r\nthe day, and at this time of year it is needful to look well ahead if a\r\nbig room is to be secured. So if you can possibly settle that point,\r\npray do.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been some oversight on my wife's part about the\r\ninvitation, but she is stating her own case. We go on a visit to Mrs.\r\nDarwin to Cambridge on Saturday week, and the Saturday after that I am\r\nbound to be at Eton.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I have sacrificed to the public Moloch so far as to promise\r\nto take the chair at a public meeting in favour of a Free Library for\r\nMarylebone on the 7th. As Wednesday's work at the Geological Society\r\nand the soiree knocked me up all yesterday, I shall be about finished I\r\nexpect on the 8th. If you are going to be at Hindhead after that, and\r\nwould have us for a day, it would be jolly; but I cannot be away long,\r\nas I have some work to finish before I go abroad.\r\n\r\nI never was so uncomfortable in my life, I think, as on Wednesday when\r\nL-- was speaking, just in front of me, at the University. Of course I\r\nwas in entire sympathy with the tenor of his speech, but I was no less\r\ncertain of the impolicy of giving a chance to such a master of polished\r\nputting-down as the Chancellor. You know Mrs. Carlyle said that Owen's\r\nsweetness reminded her of sugar of lead. Granville's was that plus\r\nbutter of antimony!\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nN.B.--Don't swear, but get Mrs. Tyndall, who is patient and\r\ngood-tempered, to read this long screed.\r\n\r\nMay 18, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your letter yesterday morning, and I conveyed\r\nyour alteration at once to Rucker, who is acting as secretary. I asked\r\nhim to communicate with you directly to save time.\r\n\r\nI hear that the proposal has been received very warmly by all sorts and\r\nconditions of men, and that is quite apart from any action of your\r\ncloser personal friends. Personally I am rather of your mind about the\r\n\"dozen or score\" of the faithful. But as that was by no means to the\r\nmind of those who started the project, and, moreover, might have given\r\nrise to some heartburning, I have not thought it desirable to meddle\r\nwith the process of spontaneous combustion. So look out for a big\r\nbonfire somewhere in the middle of June! I have a hideous cold, and can\r\nonly hope that the bracing air of Cambridge, where we go on Saturday,\r\nmay set me right.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[To recover from his pleuritic \"Jubilee Honour\" he went for a fortnight\r\n(July 11-25) to Ilkley, which had done him so much good before,\r\nintending to proceed to Switzerland as soon as he conveniently could.]\r\n\r\nIlkley, July 15, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI was very much fatigued by the journey here, but the move was good,\r\nand I am certainly mending, though not so fast as I could wish. I\r\nexpect some adhesions are interfering with my bellows. As soon as I am\r\nfit to travel I am thinking of going to Lugano, and thence to Monte\r\nGeneroso. The travelling is easy to Lugano, and I know the latter place.\r\n\r\nMy notion is I had better for the present avoid the chances of a wet,\r\ncold week in the high places.\r\n\r\nM.B.A. [Marine Biological Association]...As to the employment of the\r\nGrant, I think it ought to be on something definite and limited. The\r\nPilchard question would be an excellent one to take up.\r\n\r\n-- seems to have a notion of employing it on some geological survey of\r\nPlymouth Sound, work that would take years and years to do properly,\r\nand nothing in the way of clear result to show.\r\n\r\nI hope to be in London on my way abroad in less than ten days' time,\r\nand will let you know.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And on the same day to Sir J. Donnelly:--]\r\n\r\nI expect...that I shall have a slow convalescence. Lucky it is no worse!\r\n\r\nMuch fighting I am likely to do for the Unionist cause or any other!\r\nBut don't take me for one of the enrages. If anybody will show me a way\r\nby which the Irish may attain all they want without playing the devil\r\nwith us, I am ready to give them their own talking-shop or anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nBut that is as much writing as I can sit up and do all at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.2.\r\n\r\n1887.\r\n\r\n[On the last day of July he left England for Switzerland, and did not\r\nreturn till the end of September. A second visit to Arolla worked a\r\ngreat change in him. He renewed his Gentian studies also, with\r\nunflagging ardour. The following letters give some idea of his doings\r\nand interests:--]\r\n\r\nHotel du Mont Collon, Arolla, Switzerland, August 28, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI know you will be glad to hear that I consider myself completely set\r\nup again. We went to the Maderaner Thal and stayed a week there. But I\r\ngot no good out of it. It is charmingly pretty, but damp; and,\r\nmoreover, the hotel was 50 per cent too full of people, mainly\r\nDeutschers, and we had to turn out into the open air after dinner\r\nbecause the salon and fumoir were full of beds. So, in spite of all\r\nprudential considerations, I made up my mind to come here. We travelled\r\nover the Furca, and had a capital journey to Evolena. Thence I came on\r\nmuleback (to my great disgust, but I could not walk a bit uphill) here.\r\nI began to get better at once; and in spite of a heavy snowfall and\r\narctic weather a week ago, I have done nothing but mend. We have\r\nglorious weather now, and I can take almost as long walks as last year.\r\n\r\nWe have some Cambridge people here: Dr. Peile of Christ's and his\r\nfamily. Also Nettleship of Oxford. What is the myth about the Darwin\r\ntree in the \"Pall Mall\"? [\"A tree planted yesterday in the centre of\r\nthe circular grass plot in the first court of Christ's College, in\r\nDarwin's honour, was 'spirited' away at night.\"--\"Pall Mall Gazette\"\r\nAugust 23, 1887.] Dr. Peile believes it to be all a flam.\r\n\r\nForel has just been paying a visit to the Arolla glacier for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the internal temperature. He told me he much\r\ndesired to have a copy of the Report of the Krakatoa Committee. If it\r\nis published, will you have a copy sent to him? He is Professor at\r\nLausanne, and a very good man.\r\n\r\nOur stay here will depend on the weather. At present it is perfect. I\r\ndo not suppose we shall leave before 7th or 8th of September, and we\r\nshall get home by easy stages not much before the end of the month.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nMadder than ever on Gentians.\r\n\r\n[The following is in reply to Sir E. Frankland's inquiries with\r\nreference to the reported presence of fish in the reservoirs of one of\r\nthe water-companies.]\r\n\r\nHotel Righi Vaudois, Glion, September 16, 1887.\r\n\r\nWe left Arolla about ten days ago, and after staying a day at St.\r\nMaurice in consequence of my wife's indisposition, came on here where\r\nyour letter just received has followed me. I am happy to say I am quite\r\nset up again, and as I can manage my 1500 or 2000 feet as well as ever,\r\nI may be pretty clear that my pleurisy has not left my lung sticking\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nI will take your inquiries seriatim. (1) The faith of your small\r\nboyhood is justified. Eels do wander overland, especially in the wet\r\nstormy nights they prefer for migration. But so far as I know this is\r\nthe habit only of good-sized, downwardly-moving eels. I am not aware\r\nthat the minute fry take to the land on their journey upwards.\r\n\r\n(2) Male eels are now well known. I have gone over the evidence myself\r\nand examined many. But the reproductive organs of both sexes remain\r\nundeveloped in fresh water--just the contrary of salmon, in which they\r\nremain undeveloped in salt water.\r\n\r\n(3) So far as I know, no eel with fully-developed reproductive organs\r\nhas yet been seen. Their matrimonial operations go on in the sea where\r\nthey spend their honeymoon, and we only know the result in the shape of\r\nthe myriads of thread-like eel-lets, which migrate up in the well-known\r\n\"eel-fare.\"\r\n\r\n(4) On general principles of eel-life I think it is possible that the\r\nInspector's theory MAY be correct. But your story about the roach is a\r\nposer. They certainly do not take to walking abroad. It reminds me of\r\nthe story of the Irish milk-woman who was confronted with a stickleback\r\nfound in the milk. \"Sure, then, it must have been bad for the poor cow\r\nwhen that came through her teat.\"\r\n\r\nSurely the Inspector cannot have overlooked such a crucial fact as the\r\npresence of other fish in the reservoirs?\r\n\r\nWe shall be here another week, and then move slowly back to London. I\r\nam loth to leave this place, which is very beautiful with splendid air\r\nand charming walks in all directions--two or three thousand feet up if\r\nyou like.\r\n\r\nHotel Righi Vaudois, Glion, Switzerland, September 16, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nWe left Arolla for this place ten days ago, but my wife fell ill, and\r\nwe had to stay a day at St. Maurice. She has been more or less out of\r\nsorts ever since until to-day. However, I hope now she is all right\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThis is a very charming place at the east end of the Lake of\r\nGeneva--1500 feet above the lake--and you can walk 3000 feet higher up\r\nif you like.\r\n\r\nWhat they call a \"funicular railway\" hauls you up a gradient of 1 in 1\r\n3/4 from the station on the shore in ten minutes. At first the\r\nsensation on looking down is queer, but you soon think nothing of it.\r\nThe air is very fine, the weather lovely, the feeding unexceptionable,\r\nand the only drawback consists in the \"javelins,\" as old Francis Head\r\nused to call them--stinks of such wonderful crusted flavour that they\r\nmust have been many years in bottle. But this is a speciality of all\r\nfurrin parts that I have ever visited.\r\n\r\nI am very well and extremely lazy so far as my head goes--legs I am\r\nwilling to use to any extent up hill or down dale. They wanted me to go\r\nand speechify at Keighley in the middle of October, but I could not get\r\npermission from the authorities. Moreover, I really mean to keep quiet\r\nand abstain even from good words (few or many) next session. My wife\r\njoins with me in love to Mrs. Donnelly and yourself.\r\n\r\nShe thought she had written, but doubts whether in the multitude of her\r\nletters she did not forget.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[From Glion also he writes to Sir M. Foster:--]\r\n\r\nI have been doing some very good work on the Gentians in the interests\r\nof the business of being idle.\r\n\r\n[The same subject recurs in the next letter:--]\r\n\r\nHotel Righi Vaudois, Glion, Switzerland, September 21, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI saw in the \"Times\" yesterday the announcement of Mr. Symond's death.\r\nI suppose the deliverance from so painful a malady as heart-disease is\r\nhardly to be lamented in one sense; but these increasing gaps in one's\r\nintimate circle are very saddening, and we feel for Lady Hooker and\r\nyou. My wife has been greatly depressed in hearing of Mrs. Carpenter's\r\nfatal disorder. One cannot go away for a few weeks without finding some\r\none gone on one's return.\r\n\r\nI got no good at the Maderaner Thal, so we migrated to our old quarters\r\nat Arolla, and there I picked up in no time, and in a fortnight could\r\nwalk as well as ever. So if there are any adhesions they are pretty\r\nwell stretched by this time.\r\n\r\nI have been at the Gentians again, and worked out the development of\r\nthe flower in G. purpurea and G. campestris. The results are very\r\npretty. They both start from a thalamifloral condition, then become\r\ncorollifloral, G. purpurea at first resembling G. lutea and G.\r\ncampestris, an Ophelia, and then specialise to the Ptychantha and\r\nStephanantha forms respectively.\r\n\r\nIn G. campestris there is another very curious thing. The anthers are\r\nat first introrse, but just before the bud opens they assume this\r\nposition [sketch] and then turn right over and become extrorse. In G.\r\npurpurea this does not happen, but the anthers are made to open\r\noutwards by their union on the inner side of the slits of dehiscence.\r\n\r\nThere are several other curious bits of morphology have turned up, but\r\nI reserve them for our meeting.\r\n\r\nBeyond pottering away at my Gentians and doing a little with that\r\nextraordinary Cynanchum I have been splendidly idle. After three weeks\r\nof the ascetic life of Arolla, we came here to acclimatise ourselves to\r\nlower levels and to fatten up. I go straight through the table d'hote\r\nat each meal, and know not indigestion.\r\n\r\nMy wife has fared not so well, but she is all right again now. We go\r\nhome by easy stages, and expect to be in Marlborough Place on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nWith all our best wishes to Lady Hooker and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The second visit to Arolla did as much good as the first. Though\r\nunable to stay more than a week or two in London itself, he was greatly\r\ninvigorated. His renewed strength enabled him to carry out vigorously\r\nsuch work as he had put his hand to, and still more, to endure one of\r\nthe greatest sorrows of his whole life which was to befall him this\r\nautumn in the death of his daughter Marian.\r\n\r\nThe controversy which fell to his share immediately upon his return,\r\nhas already been mentioned. This was all part of the war for science\r\nwhich he took as his necessary portion in life; but he would not plunge\r\ninto any other forms of controversy, however interesting. So he writes\r\nto his son, who had conveyed him a message from the editor of a\r\npolitical review:--]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, October 19, 1887.\r\n\r\nNo political article from me! I have had to blow off my indignation\r\nincidentally now and then lest worse might befall me, but as to serious\r\npolitical controversy, I have other fish to fry. Such influence as I\r\npossess may be most usefully employed in promoting various educational\r\nmovements now afoot, and I do not want to bar myself from working with\r\nmen of all political parties.\r\n\r\nSo excuse me in the prettiest language at your command to Mr. A.\r\n\r\n[Nevertheless politics very soon drew him into a new conflict, in\r\ndefence, be it said, of science against the possible contamination of\r\npolitical influences. Professor (now Sir) G.G. Stokes, his successor in\r\nthe chair of the Royal Society, accepted an invitation from the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge to stand for election as their member of\r\nParliament, and was duly elected. This was a step to which many Fellows\r\nof the Royal Society, and Huxley in especial, objected very strongly.\r\nProperly to fulfil the duties of both offices at once was, in his\r\nopinion, impossible. It might seem for the moment an advantage that the\r\naccredited head of the scientific world should represent its interests\r\nofficially in Parliament; but the precedent was full of danger. Science\r\nbeing essentially of no party, it was especially needful for such a\r\nrepresentative of science to keep free from all possible entanglements;\r\nto avoid committing science, as it were, officially to the policy of a\r\nparty, or, as its inevitable consequence, introducing political\r\nconsiderations into the choice of a future President.\r\n\r\nDuring his own tenure of the Presidency Huxley had carefully abstained\r\nfrom any official connection with societies are public movements on\r\nwhich the feeling of the Royal Society was divided, lest as a body it\r\nmight seem committed by the person and name of its President. He\r\nthought it a mistake that his successor should even be President of the\r\nVictoria Institute.\r\n\r\nThus there is a good deal in his correspondence bearing on this matter.\r\nHe writes on November 6 to Sir J. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nI am extremely exercised in my mind about Stokes' going into Parliament\r\n(as a strong party man, moreover) while still P.R.S. I do not know what\r\nyou may think about it, but to my mind it is utterly wrong--and\r\ndegrading to the Society--by introducing politics into its affairs.\r\n\r\n[And on the same day to Sir M. Foster:--]\r\n\r\nI think it is extremely improper for the President of the Royal Society\r\nto accept a position as a party politician. As a Unionist I should vote\r\nfor him if I had a vote for Cambridge University, but for all that I\r\nthink it is most lamentable that the President of the Society should be\r\ndragged into party mud.\r\n\r\nWhen I was President I refused to take the Presidency of the Sunday\r\nLeague, because of the division of opinion on the subject. Now we are\r\nbeing connected with the Victoria Institute, and sucked into the slough\r\nof politics.\r\n\r\n[These considerations weighed heavily with several both of the older\r\nand the younger members of the Society; but the majority were\r\nindifferent to the dangers of the precedent. The Council could not\r\ndiscuss the matter; they waited in vain for an official announcement of\r\nhis election from the President, while he, as it turned out, expected\r\nthem to broach the subject.\r\n\r\nVarious proposals were discussed; but it seemed best that, as a\r\npreliminary to further action, an editorial article written by Huxley\r\nshould be inserted in \"Nature,\" indicating what was felt by a section\r\nof the Society, and suggesting that resignation of one of the two\r\noffices was the right solution of the difficulty.\r\n\r\nFinally, it seemed that perhaps, after all, a] \"masterly inactivity\"\r\n[was the best line of action. Without risk of an authoritative decision\r\nof the Society] \"the wrong way,\" [out of personal regard for the\r\nPresident, the question would be solved for him by actual experience of\r\nwork in the House of Commons, where he would doubtless discover that he\r\nmust] \"renounce either science, or politics, or existence.\"\r\n\r\nThis campaign, however, against a principle, was carried on without any\r\npersonal feeling. The perfect simplicity of the President's attitude\r\nwould have disarmed the hottest opponent, and indeed Huxley took\r\noccasion to write him the following letter, in reference to which he\r\nwrites to Dr. Foster:--] \"I hate doing things in the dark and could not\r\nstand it any longer.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 1, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Stokes,\r\n\r\nWhen we met in the hall of the Athenaeum on Monday evening I was on the\r\npoint of speaking to you on a somewhat delicate topic; namely, my\r\nresponsibility for the leading article on the Presidency of the Royal\r\nSociety and politics which appeared a fortnight ago in \"Nature.\" But I\r\nwas restrained by the reflection that I had no right to say anything\r\nabout the matter without the consent of the Editor of \"Nature.\" I have\r\nobtained that consent, and I take the earliest opportunity of availing\r\nmyself of my freedom.\r\n\r\nI should have greatly preferred to sign the article, and its anonymity\r\nis due to nothing but my strong desire to avoid the introduction of any\r\npersonal irrelevancies into the discussion of a very grave question of\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI may add that as you are quite certain to vote in the way that I think\r\nright on the only political questions which greatly interest me, my\r\naction has not been, and cannot be, in any way affected by political\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nAnd as there is no one of whom I have a higher opinion as a man of\r\nscience--no one whom I should be more glad to serve under, and to\r\nsupport year after year in the Chair of the Society, and no one for\r\nwhom I entertain feelings of more sincere friendship---I trust you will\r\nbelieve that, if there is a word in the article which appears\r\ninconsistent with these feelings, it is there by oversight, and is\r\nsincerely regretted.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty odd years we have known one another, we have often\r\nhad stout battles without loss of mutual kindness. My chief object in\r\ntroubling you with this letter is to express the hope that, whatever\r\nhappens, this state of things may continue.\r\n\r\nI am, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I am still of opinion that it is better that my authorship should\r\nnot be officially recognised, but you are, of course, free to use the\r\ninformation I have given you in any way you may think fit.\r\n\r\n[To this the President returned a very frank and friendly reply; saying\r\nhe had never dreamed of any incompatibility existing between the two\r\noffices, and urging that the Presidency ought not to constrain a man to\r\ngive up his ordinary duties as a citizen. He concludes:--\r\n\r\nAnd now I have stated my case as it appears to myself; let me assure\r\nyou that nothing that has passed tends at all to diminish my friendship\r\ntowards you. My wife heard last night that the article was yours, and\r\ntold me so. I rather thought it must have been written by some hot\r\nGladstonian. It seems, however, that her informant was right. She\r\nwishes me to tell you that she replied to her informant that she felt\r\nquite sure that if you wrote it, it was because you thought it.\r\n\r\nTo which Huxley replied:--]\r\n\r\nI am much obliged for your letter, which is just such as I felt sure\r\nyou would write.\r\n\r\nPray thank Mrs. Stokes for her kind message. I am very grateful for her\r\nconfidence in my uprightness of intention.\r\n\r\nWe must agree to differ.\r\n\r\nIt may be needful for me and those who agree with me to place our\r\nopinions on record; but you may depend upon it that nothing will be\r\ndone which can suggest any lack of friendship or respect for our\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n[It will be seen from this correspondence and the letter to Sir J.\r\nDonnelly of July 15, that Huxley was a staunch Unionist. Not that he\r\nconsidered the actual course of English rule in Ireland ideal; his main\r\npoint was that under the circumstances the establishment of Home Rule\r\nwas a distinct betrayal of trust, considering that on the strength of\r\nGovernment promises, an immense number of persons had entered into\r\ncontracts, had bought land, and staked their fortunes in Ireland, who\r\nwould be ruined by the establishment of Home Rule. Moreover, he held\r\nthat the right of self-preservation entitled a nation to refuse to\r\nestablish at its very gates a power which could, and perhaps would, be\r\na danger to its own existence. Of the capacity of the Irish peasant for\r\nself-government he had no high opinion, and what he had seen of the\r\ncountry, and especially the great central plain, in his frequent visits\r\nto Ireland, convinced him that the balance between subsistence and\r\npopulation would speedily create a new agrarian question, whatever\r\npolitical schemes were introduced. This was one of] \"the only political\r\nquestions which interested him.\"\r\n\r\n[Towards the end of October he left London for Hastings, partly for his\r\nown, but still more for his wife's sake, as she was far from well. He\r\nwas still busy with one or two Royal Society Committees, and came up to\r\ntown occasionally to attend their meetings, especially those dealing\r\nwith the borings in the Delta, and with Antarctic exploration. Thus he\r\nwrites:--]\r\n\r\n11 Eversfield Place, Hastings, October 31, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nWe have been here for the last week, and are likely to be here for some\r\ntime, as my wife, though mending, is getting on but slowly, and she\r\nwill be as well out of London through beastly November. I shall be up\r\non Thursday and return on Friday, but I do not want to be away longer,\r\nas it is lonesome for the wife.\r\n\r\nI quite agree to what you propose on Committee, so I need not be there.\r\nVery glad to hear that the Council \"very much applauded what we had\r\ndone,\" and hope we shall get the 500 pounds.\r\n\r\nI don't believe a word in increasing whale fishery, but scientifically,\r\nthe Antarctic expedition would, or might be very interesting, and if\r\nthe colonies will do their part, I think we ought to do ours.\r\n\r\nYou won't want me at that Committee either. Hope to see you on Thursday.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHideous pen!\r\n\r\n[But he did not come up that Thursday. His wife was for a time too ill\r\nto be left, and he winds up the letter of November 2 to Dr. Foster with\r\nthe reflection:--]\r\n\r\nMan is born to trouble as the sparks, etc.--but when you have come to\r\nmy time of life you will say as I do--Lucky it is no worse.\r\n\r\nNovember 6.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear that the 500 pounds is granted, and I will see\r\nto what is next to be done as soon as I can. Also I am very glad to\r\nfind you don't want my valuable service on Council Royal Society. I\r\nrepented me of my offer when I thought how little I might be able to\r\nattend.\r\n\r\n[One thing, however, afforded him great pleasure at this time. He\r\nwrites on November 6 to his old friend, Sir J. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nI write just to say what infinite satisfaction the award of the Copley\r\nMedal to you has given me. If you were not my dear old friend, it would\r\nrejoice me as a mere matter of justice--of which there is none too much\r\nin this \"-- rum world,\" as Whitworth's friend called it.\r\n\r\n[To the reply that the award was not according to rule, inasmuch as it\r\nwas the turn for the medal to be awarded in another branch of science,\r\nhe rejoins:--]\r\n\r\nI had forgotten all about the business--but he had done nothing to\r\ndeserve the Copley, and all I can say is that if the present award is\r\ncontrary to law, the \"law's a hass\" as Mr. Bumble said. But I don't\r\nbelieve that it is.\r\n\r\n[He replies also on November 5 to a clerical correspondent who had\r\nwritten to him on the distinction between sheretz and rehmes, and\r\naccused him of \"wilful blindness\" in his theological controversy of\r\n1886:--]\r\n\r\nLet me assure you that it is not my way to set my face against being\r\nconvinced by evidence.\r\n\r\nI really cannot hold myself to be responsible for the translators of\r\nthe Revised Version of the Old Testament. If I had given a translation\r\nof the passage to which you refer on my own authority, any mistake\r\nwould be mine, and I should be bound to acknowledge it. As I did not, I\r\nhave nothing to admit. I have every respect for your and Mr. --'s\r\nauthority as Hebraists, but I have noticed that Hebrew scholars are apt\r\nto hold very divergent views, and before admitting either your or Mr.\r\n--'s interpretation, I should like to see the question fully discussed.\r\n\r\nIf, when the discussion is concluded, the balance of authority is\r\nagainst the revised version, I will carefully consider how far the\r\nneedful alterations may affect the substance of the one passage in my\r\nreply to Mr. Gladstone which is affected by it.\r\n\r\nAt present I am by no means clear that it will make much difference,\r\nand in no case will the main lines of my argument as to the antagonism\r\nbetween modern science and the Pentateuch be affected. The statements I\r\nhave made are public property. If you think they are in any way\r\nerroneous I must ask you to take upon yourself the same amount of\r\nresponsibility as I have done, and submit your objections to the same\r\nordeal.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like this test for reducing things to their true\r\nproportions, and if you try it, you will probably discover, not without\r\nsome discomfort, that you really had no reason to ascribe wilful\r\nblindness to those who do not agree with you.\r\n\r\n[He was now preparing to complete his campaign of the spring on\r\ntechnical education by delivering an address to the Technical Education\r\nAssociation at Manchester on November 29, and looked forward to\r\nattending the anniversary meeting of the Royal Society on his way home\r\nnext day, and seeing the Copley medal conferred upon his old friend,\r\nSir J. Hooker. However, unexpected trouble befell him. First he was\r\nmuch alarmed about his wife, who had been ill more or less ever since\r\nleaving Arolla. Happily it turned out that there was nothing worse than\r\ncould be set right by a slight operation. But nothing had been done\r\nwhen news came of the sudden death of his second daughter on November\r\n19.] \"I have no heart for anything just now,\" [he writes; nevertheless,\r\nhe forced himself to fulfil this important engagement at Manchester,\r\nand in the end the necessity of bracing himself for the undertaking\r\nacted on him as a tonic.\r\n\r\nIt is a trifle, perhaps, but a trifle significant of the disturbance of\r\nmind that could override so firmly fixed a habit, that the two first\r\nletters he wrote after receiving the news are undated; almost the only\r\nomission of the sort I have found in all his letters of the last\r\ntwenty-five years of his life.\r\n\r\nHis daughter's long illness had left him without hope for months past,\r\nbut this, as he confessed, did not mend matters much. In his letters to\r\nhis two most intimate friends, he recalls her brilliant promise, her\r\nhappy marriage, her] \"faculty for art, which some of the best artists\r\nhave told me amounted to genius.\" [But he was naturally reticent in\r\nthese matters, and would hardly write of his own griefs unbidden even\r\nto old friends.]\r\n\r\n85 Marina, St. Leonards, November 21, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nYou will not have forgotten my bright girl Marian, who married so\r\nhappily and with such bright prospects half a dozen years ago?\r\n\r\nWell, she died three days ago of a sudden attack of pneumonia, which\r\ncarried her off almost without warning. And I cannot convey to you a\r\nsense of the terrible sufferings of the last three years better than by\r\nsaying that I, her father, who loved her well, am glad that the end has\r\ncome thus...\r\n\r\nMy poor wife is well nigh crushed by the blow. For though I had lost\r\nhope, it was not in the nature of things that she should.\r\n\r\nDon't answer this--I have half a mind to tear it up--for when one is in\r\na pool of trouble there is no sort of good in splashing other people.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[As for his plans, he writes to Sir J. Hooker on November 21:--]\r\n\r\nI had set my heart on seeing you get the Copley on the 30th. In fact, I\r\nmade the Manchester people, to whom I had made a promise to go down and\r\naddress the Technical Education Association, change their day to the\r\n29th for that reason.\r\n\r\nI cannot leave them in the lurch after stirring up the business in the\r\nway I have done, and I must go and give my address. But I must get back\r\nto my poor wife as fast as I can, and I cannot face any more publicity\r\nthan that which it would be cowardly to shirk just now. So I shall not\r\nbe at the Society except in the spirit.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And again to Sir M. Foster:--]\r\n\r\nYou cannot be more sorry than I am that I am going to Manchester, but I\r\nam not proud of chalking up \"no popery\" and running away--for all\r\nEvans' and your chaff--and, having done a good deal to stir up the\r\nTechnical Education business and the formation of the Association, I\r\ncannot leave them in the lurch when they urgently ask for my services...\r\n\r\nThe Delta business must wait till after the 30th. I have no heart for\r\nanything just now.\r\n\r\n[The letters following were written in answer to letters of sympathy.]\r\n\r\n85 Marina, St. Leonards, November 25, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Clodd,\r\n\r\nLet me thank you on my wife's behalf and my own for your very kind and\r\nsympathetic letter.\r\n\r\nMy poor child's death is the end of more than three years of suffering\r\non her part, and deep anxiety on ours. I suppose we ought to rejoice\r\nthat the end has come, on the whole, so mercifully. But I find that\r\neven I, who knew better, hoped against hope, and my poor wife, who was\r\nunfortunately already very ill, is quite heart-broken. Otherwise, she\r\nwould have replied herself to your very kind letter.\r\n\r\nShe has never yet learned the art of sparing herself, and I find it\r\nhard work to teach her.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In the same strain he writes to Dr. Dyster:--]\r\n\r\nRationally we must admit that it is best so. But then, whatever\r\nLinnaeus may say, man is not a rational animal--especially in his\r\nparental capacity.\r\n\r\n85, Marina, St. Leonards, November 25, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI really must thank you very heartily for your letter. It went to our\r\nhearts and did us good, and I know you will like to learn that you have\r\nhelped us in this grievous time.\r\n\r\nMy wife is better, but fit for very little; and I do not let her write\r\na letter even, if I can help it. But it is a great deal harder to keep\r\nher from doing what she thinks her duty than to get most other people\r\nto do what plainly is their duty.\r\n\r\nWith our kindest love and thanks to all of you.\r\n\r\nEver, my dear Knowles, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nYes, you are quite right about \"loyal.\" I love my friends and hate my\r\nenemies, which may not be in accordance with the Gospel, but I have\r\nfound it a good wearing creed for honest men.\r\n\r\n[The \"Address on behalf of the National Association for the Promotion\r\nof Technical Education,\" first published in the ensuing number of\r\n\"Science and Art,\" and reprinted in \"Collected Essays,\" 3 427-451, was\r\nduly delivered in Manchester, and produced a considerable effect.\r\n\r\nHe writes to Sir M. Foster, December 1:--]\r\n\r\nI am glad I resisted the strong temptation to shirk the business.\r\nManchester has gone solid for technical education, and if the idiotic\r\nLondon papers, instead of giving half a dozen lines of my speech, had\r\nmentioned the solid contributions to the work announced at the meeting,\r\nthey would have enabled you to understand its importance.\r\n\r\n...I have the satisfaction of having got through a hard bit of work,\r\nand am none the worse physically--rather the better for having to pull\r\nmyself together.\r\n\r\n[And to Sir J.

I shall ask for a bill of indemnity.\r\n\r\nI was rather used up yesterday, but am picking up. In fact my\r\nManchester journey convinced me that there was more stuff left than I\r\nthought for. I travelled 400 miles, and made a speech of fifty minutes\r\nin a hot, crowded room, all in about twelve hours, and was none the\r\nworse. Manchester, Liverpool, and Newcastle have now gone in for\r\ntechnical education on a grand scale, and the work is practically done.\r\nNunc dimittis!\r\n\r\nI hear great things of your speech at the dinner.

I have always looked upon Hooker's\r\ninsight into the importance of these things and their skeletons as a\r\nremarkable piece of inquiry--anticipative of subsequent deep sea work.\r\n\r\nBest thanks for taking so much trouble about H--. Pray tell him if ever\r\nyou write that I have not answered his letter only because I awaited\r\nyour reply. He may think my silence uncivil...\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H.

Of\r\ncourse I have looked at \"Genera Plantarum\" and De Candolle.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to make out whether structure or climate or\r\npaleontology throw any light on their distribution--and am drawing\r\ncomplete blank. Why the deuce are there no Conifers but Podocarpus and\r\nWidringtonias in all Africa south of the Sahara? And why the double\r\ndeuce are about three-quarters of the genera huddled together in Japan\r\nand northern China?\r\n\r\nI am puzzling over this group because the paleontological record is\r\ncomparatively so good.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to suspect that present distribution is an affair rather\r\nof denudation than migration.\r\n\r\nSequoia!

That is\r\nsomething most originally Spencerian. I have hardly any suggestions to\r\nmake, except in what you say about the \"Rattlesnake\" work and my\r\nposition on board.\r\n\r\nHer proper business was the survey of the so-called \"inner passage\"\r\nbetween the Barrier Reef and the east coast of Australia; the New\r\nGuinea work was a hors d'oeuvre, and dealt with only a small part of\r\nthe southern coast.\r\n\r\nMacgillivray was naturalist--I was actually Assistant-Surgeon and\r\nnothing else. But I was recommended to Stanley by Sir John Richardson,\r\nmy senior officer at Haslar, on account of my scientific proclivities.\r\nBut scientific work was no part of my duty. How odd it is to look back\r\nthrough the vista of years! Reading your account of me, I had the\r\nsensation of studying a fly in amber. I had utterly forgotten the\r\nparticular circumstance that brought us together. Considering what\r\nwilful tykes we both are (you particularly), I think it is a great\r\ncredit to both of us that we are firmer friends now than we were then.\r\nYour kindly words have given me much pleasure.\r\n\r\nThis is a deuce of a long letter to inflict upon you, but there is more\r\ncoming. The other day a Miss --, a very good, busy woman of whom I and\r\nmy wife have known a little for some years, sent me a proposal of the\r\ncommittee of a body calling itself the London Liberty League (I think)\r\nthat I should accept the position of one of three honorary something or\r\nothers, you and Mrs. Fawcett being the other two.\r\n\r\nNow you may be sure that I should be glad enough to be associated with\r\nyou in anything; but considering the innumerable battles we have fought\r\nover education, vaccination, and so on, it seemed to me that if the\r\nprogramme of the League were wide enough to take us both for\r\nfigure-heads, it must be so elastic as to verge upon infinite\r\nextensibility; and that one or other of us would be in a false position.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote to Miss -- to that effect, and the matter then dropped.\r\n\r\nMisrepresentation is so rife in this world that it struck me I had\r\nbetter tell you exactly what happened.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, your account of your own condition is encouraging; not\r\ngoing back is next door to going forward. Anyhow, you have contrived to\r\ndo a lot of writing.\r\n\r\nWe are all pretty flourishing, and if my wife does not get worn out\r\nwith cooks falling ill and other domestic worries, I shall be content.\r\n\r\nNow this really is the end.\r\n\r\nEver yours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, London, N.W., March 7, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Skelton [This letter is one of the twelve from T.H.H. already\r\npublished by Sir John Skelton in his \"Table Talk of Shirley\" page 295\r\nsq.],\r\n\r\nWretch that I am, I see that I have never had the grace to thank you\r\nfor \"Maitland of Lethington\" which reached me I do not choose to\r\nremember how long ago, and which I read straight off with lively\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThere is a paragraph in your preface, which I meant to have charged you\r\nwith having plagiarised from an article of mine, which had not appeared\r\nwhen I got your book. In that Hermitage of yours, you are up to any\r\nEsotericobuddhistotelepathic dodge!\r\n\r\nIt is about the value of practical discipline to historians. Half of\r\nthem know nothing of life, and still less of government and the ways of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nI am quite useless, but have vitality enough to kick and scratch a\r\nlittle when prodded.\r\n\r\nI am at present engaged on a series of experiments on the thickness of\r\nskin of that wonderful little wind-bag --. The way that second rate\r\namateur poses as a man of science, having authority as a sort of\r\npapistical Scotch dominie, bred a minister, but stickit, really \"rouses\r\nmy corruption.\" What a good phrase that is. I am cursed with a lot of\r\nit, and any fool can strike ile.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nPlease remember me very kindly to Mrs. Skelton.\r\n\r\n11 Eversfield Place, Hastings, November 18, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to get your letter this morning. I heard all about you\r\nfrom Hirst before I left London, now nearly a month ago, and I promised\r\nmyself that instead of bothering you with a letter I would run over\r\nfrom here and pay you a visit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my wife, who had been ill more or less ever since we\r\nleft Arolla and came here on Clark's advice, had an attack one night,\r\nwhich frightened me a good deal, though it luckily turned out to arise\r\nfrom easily remediable causes.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances you will understand how I have not made my\r\nproposed journey to Brighton.\r\n\r\nI am rejoiced to hear of your move. I believe in the skill of Dr. B.\r\nPotter and her understanding of the case more than I do in all the\r\ndoctors and yourself put together. Please offer my respectful homage to\r\nthat eminent practitioner.\r\n\r\nYou see people won't let me alone, and I have had to tell the Duke to\r\n\"keep on board his own ship,\" as the Quaker said, once more. I seek\r\npeace, but do not ensue it.\r\n\r\nSend any quantity of proofs, they are a good sign. By the way, we move\r\nto 85 Marina, St. Leonards, to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWife sends her kind regards.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n85 Marina, St. Leonards, December 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI have nothing to criticise in the enclosed except that the itineraries\r\nseem to me rather superfluous.\r\n\r\nI am glad to find that you forget things that have happened to you as\r\ncompletely as I do. I should cut almost as bad a figure as \"Sir Roger\"\r\nif I were cross-examined about my past life.\r\n\r\nYour allusion to sending me the proofs made me laugh by reminding me of\r\na particularly insolent criticism with which I once favoured you: \"No\r\nobjection except to the whole.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some piece of diabolical dialectics, in which I could pick no\r\nhole, if the premises were granted--and even then could be questioned\r\nonly by an ultra-sceptic!\r\n\r\nDo you see that the American Association of Authors has adopted a\r\nResolution, which is a complete endorsement of my view of the\r\nstamp-swindle?\r\n\r\nWe have got our operation over, and my wife is going on very well.\r\nOvermuch anxiety has been telling on me, but I shall throw it off.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.3.\r\n\r\n1888.\r\n\r\n[Huxley had returned to town before Christmas, for the house in St.\r\nJohn's Wood was still the rallying-point for the family, although his\r\nelder children were now married and dispersed. But he did not stay\r\nlong.] \"Wife wonderfully better,\" [he writes to Sir M. Foster on\r\nJanuary 8,] \"self as melancholy as a pelican in the wilderness.\" [He\r\nmeant to have left London on the 16th, but his depressed condition\r\nproved to be the beginning of a second attack of pleurisy, and he was\r\nunable to start for Bournemouth till the 24th.\r\n\r\nHere, however, his recovery was very slow. He was unable to come up to\r\nthe first meeting of the x Club.] \"I trust,\" [he writes,] \"I shall be\r\nable to be at the next x--but I am getting on very slowly. I can't walk\r\nabove a couple of miles without being exhausted, and talking for twenty\r\nminutes has the same effect. I suppose it is all Anno Domini.\"\r\n\r\n[But he had a pleasant visit from one of the x, and writes:--]\r\n\r\nCasalini, West Cliff, Bournemouth, January 29, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nSpencer was here an hour ago as lively as a cricket. He is going back\r\nto town on Tuesday to plunge into the dissipations of the Metropolis. I\r\nexpect he will insist on you all going to Evans' (or whatever\r\nrepresents that place to our descendants) after the x.\r\n\r\nBellows very creaky--took me six weeks to get them mended last time, so\r\nI suppose I may expect as long now.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[As appears from the letters which follow, he had been busied with\r\nwriting an article for the \"Nineteenth Century,\" for February, on the\r\n\"Struggle for Existence\" (\"Collected Essays\" 9 195.), which on the one\r\nhand ran counter to some of Mr. Herbert Spencer's theories of society;\r\nand on the other, is noticeable as briefly enunciating the main thesis\r\nof his \"Romanes Lecture\" of 1893.]\r\n\r\n85 Marina, St. Leonards, December 13, 1887.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI have to go to town to-morrow for a day, so that puts an end to the\r\npossibility of getting my screed ready for January. Altogether it will\r\nbe better to let it stand over.\r\n\r\nI do not know whence the copyright extract came, except that, as\r\nPutnam's name was on the envelope, I suppose they sent it.\r\n\r\nPearsall Smith's practice is a wonderful commentary on his theory.\r\nDistribute the contents of the baker's shop gratis--it will give people\r\na taste for bread!\r\n\r\nGreat is humbug, and it will prevail, unless the people who do not like\r\nit hit hard.

Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, January 9, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nHere is my proof. Will you mind running your eye over it?\r\n\r\nThe article is long, and partly for that reason and partly because the\r\ngeneral public wants principles rather than details, I have condensed\r\nthe practical half.\r\n\r\nH. Spencer and \"Jus\" will be in a white rage with me.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[To Professor Frankland, February 6:--]\r\n\r\nI am glad you like my article. There is no doubt it is rather like a\r\ntadpole, with a very big head and a rather thin tail. But the subject\r\nis a ticklish one to deal with, and I deliberately left a good deal\r\nsuggested rather than expressed.\r\n\r\nCasalini, West Cliff, Bournemouth, February 9, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nNo! I don't think softening has begun yet--vide \"Nature\" this week.\r\n[\"Nature\" 37 337 for February 9, 1888: review of his article in the\r\n\"Nineteenth Century\" on the \"Industrial Struggle for Existence.\"] I am\r\nglad you found the article worth a second go. I took a vast of trouble\r\n(as the country folks say) about it. I am afraid it has made Spencer\r\nvery angry--but he knows I think he has been doing mischief this long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBellows to mend! Bellows to mend! I am getting very tired of it. If I\r\nwalk two or three miles, however slowly, I am regularly done for at the\r\nend of it. I expect there has been more mischief than I thought for.\r\n\r\nHow about the Bill?\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[However, he and Mr. Spencer wrote their minds to each other on the\r\nsubject, and as Huxley remarks with reference to this occasion,] \"the\r\nprocess does us both good, and in no way interferes with our\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\n[The letter immediately following, to Mr. Romanes, answers an inquiry\r\nabout a passage quoted from Huxley's writings by Professor Schurman in\r\nhis \"Ethical Import of Darwinism.\" This passage, made up of sentences\r\nfrom two different essays, runs as follows:--]\r\n\r\nIt is quite conceivable that every species tends to produce varieties\r\nof a limited number and kind, and that the effect of natural selection\r\nis to favour the development of some of these, while it opposes the\r\ndevelopment of others along their predetermined line of modification.\r\n(\"Collected Essays\" 2 223.) A whale does not tend to vary in the\r\ndirection of producing feathers, nor a bird in the direction of\r\nproducing whalebone. (In \"Mr. Darwin's Critics\" 1871 \"Collected Essays\"\r\n2 181.)\r\n\r\n\"On the strength of these extracts\" (writes Mr. Romanes), \"Schurman\r\nrepresents you 'to presuppose design, since development takes place\r\nalong certain predetermined lines of modification.' But as he does not\r\ngive references, and as I do not remember the passages, I cannot\r\nconsult the context, which I fancy must give a different colouring to\r\nthe extracts.\"\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, January 5, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nThey say that liars ought to have long memories. I am sure authors\r\nought to. I could not at first remember where the passage Schurman\r\nquotes occurs, but I did find it in the Encyclopaedia Britannica\r\narticle on \"Evolution\" [\"Collected Essays\" 2 223.], reprinted in\r\n\"Science and Culture,\" page 307.\r\n\r\nBut I do not find anything about the \"whale\" here. Nevertheless I have\r\na consciousness of having said something of the kind somewhere. [In\r\n\"Mr. Darwin's Critics\" 1871 \"Collected Essays\" 2 181.]\r\n\r\nIf you look at the whole passage, you will see that there is not the\r\nleast intention on my part to presuppose design.\r\n\r\nIf you break a piece of Iceland spar with a hammer, all the pieces will\r\nhave shapes of a certain kind, but that does not imply that the Iceland\r\nspar was constructed for the purpose of breaking up in this way when\r\nstruck. The atomic theory implies that of all possible compounds of A\r\nand B only those will actually exist in which the proportions of A and\r\nB by weight bear a certain numerical ratio. But it is mere arguing in a\r\ncircle to say that the fact being so is evidence that it was designed\r\nto be so.\r\n\r\nI am not going to take any more notice of the everlasting D--, as you\r\nappropriately call him, until he has withdrawn his slanders....\r\n\r\nPray give him a dressing--it will be one of those rare combinations of\r\nduty and pleasure.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He was, moreover, constantly interested in schemes for the reform of\r\nthe scientific work of the London University, and for the enlargement\r\nof the scope and usefulness of the Royal Society. As for the latter, a\r\nproposal had been made for federation with colonial scientific\r\nsocieties, which was opposed by some of his friends in the x Club; and\r\nhe writes to Sir E. Frankland on February 3:--]\r\n\r\nI am very sorry you are all against Evans' scheme. I am for it. I think\r\nit a very good proposal, and after all the talk, I do not want to see\r\nthe Society look foolish by doing nothing.\r\n\r\nYou are a lot of obstructive old Tories, and want routing out. If I\r\nwere only younger and less indisposed to any sort of exertion, I would\r\nrout you out finely!\r\n\r\n[With respect to the former, it had been proposed that medical degrees\r\nshould be conferred, not by the university, but by a union of the\r\nseveral colleges concerned. He writes:--]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, January 11, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI send back the \"Heathen Deutscheree's\" (whose ways are dark) letter\r\nlest I forget it to-morrow.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile perpend these two things:--\r\n\r\n1. United Colleges propose to give just as good an examination and\r\nrequire as much qualification as the Scotch Universities. Why then give\r\ntheir degree a distinguishing mark?\r\n\r\n2. \"Academical distinctions\" in medicine are all humbug. You are making\r\na medical technical school at Cambridge--and quite right too. The\r\nUnited Colleges, if they do their business properly, will confer just\r\nas much, or as little \"academical distinction\" as Cambridge by their\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n3. The Fellowship of the College of Surgeons is in every sense as much\r\nan \"academical distinction\" as the Masterships in Surgery or Doctorate\r\nof Medicine of the Scotch and English Universities.\r\n\r\n4. You may as well cry for the moon as ask my colleagues in the Senate\r\nto meddle seriously with the Matriculation. They are possessed by the\r\ndevil that cries continually, \"There is only the Liberal education, and\r\nGreek and Latin are his prophets.\"\r\n\r\n[At Bournemouth he also applied himself to writing the Darwin obituary\r\nnotice for the Royal Society, a labour of love which he had long felt\r\nunequal to undertaking. The manuscript was finally sent off to the\r\nprinter's on April 6, unlike the still longer unfinished memoir on\r\nSpirula, to which allusion is made here, among other business of the\r\n\"Challenger\" Committee, of which he was a member.\r\n\r\nOn February 12 he writes to Sir J. Evans:--]\r\n\r\nSpirula is a horrid burden on my conscience--but nobody could make head\r\nor tail of the business but myself.\r\n\r\nThat and Darwin's obituary are the chief subjects of my meditations\r\nwhen I wake in the night. But I do not get much \"forrarder,\" and I am\r\nafraid I shall not until I get back to London.\r\n\r\nBournemouth, February 14, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Treasury will jump at any proposition which relieves them\r\nfrom further expense--but I cannot say I like the notion of leaving\r\nsome of the most important results of the \"Challenger\" voyage to be\r\npublished elsewhere than in the official record....\r\n\r\nEvans made a deft allusion to Spirula, like a powder between two dabs\r\nof jam. At present I have no moral sense, but it may awake as the days\r\nget longer.\r\n\r\nI have been reading the \"Origin\" slowly again for the nth time, with\r\nthe view of picking out the essentials of the argument, for the\r\nobituary notice. Nothing entertains me more than to hear people call it\r\neasy reading.\r\n\r\nExposition was not Darwin's forte--and his English is sometimes\r\nwonderful. But there is a marvellous dumb sagacity about him--like that\r\nof a sort of miraculous dog--and he gets to the truth by ways as dark\r\nas those of the Heathen Chinee.\r\n\r\nI am getting quite sick of all the \"paper philosophers,\" as old Galileo\r\ncalled them, who are trying to stand upon Darwin's shoulders and look\r\nbigger than he, when in point of real knowledge they are not fit to\r\nblack his shoes. It is just as well I am collapsed or I believe I\r\nshould break out with a final \"Fur Darwin.\"\r\n\r\nI will think of you when I get as far as the fossils. At present I am\r\npoking over P. sylvestris and P. pinnata in the intervals of weariness.\r\n\r\nMy wife joins with me in love to you both.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nSnow and cold winds here. Hope you are as badly off at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nBournemouth, February 21, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nWe have had nothing but frost and snow here lately, and at present half\r\na gale of the bitterest north-easter I have felt since we were at\r\nFlorence is raging. [Similarly to Sir J. Evans on the 28th]--\"I get my\r\nstrength back but slowly, and think of migrating to Greenland or\r\nSpitzbergen for a milder climate.\"]\r\n\r\nI believe I am getting better, as I have noticed that at a particular\r\nstage of my convalescence from any sort of illness I pass through a\r\ncondition in which things in general appear damnable and I myself an\r\nentire failure. If that is a sign of returning health you may look upon\r\nmy restoration as certain.\r\n\r\nIf it is only Murray's speculations he wants to publish separately, I\r\nshould say by all means let him. But the facts, whether advanced by him\r\nor other people, ought all to be in the official record. I agree we\r\ncan't stir.\r\n\r\nI scented the \"goak.\" How confoundedly proud you are of it. In former\r\ndays I have been known to joke myself.\r\n\r\nI will look after the questions if you like. In my present state of\r\nmind I shall be a capital critic--on Dizzy's views of critics...\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This year Huxley was appointed a Trustee of the British Museum, an\r\noffice which he had held ex officio from 1883 to 1885, as President of\r\nthe Royal Society.\r\n\r\nThis is referred to in the following letter of March 9:--]\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nHaving nothing to do plays the devil with doing anything, and I suppose\r\nthat is why I have been so long about answering your letter.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing the matter with me now except want of strength. I am\r\ntired out with a three-mile walk, and my voice goes if I talk for any\r\ntime. I do not suppose I shall do much good till I get into high and\r\ndry air, and it is too early for Switzerland yet....\r\n\r\nYou see I was honoured and gloried by a trusteeship of the British\r\nMuseum. [Replying on the 2nd to Sir John Evans' congratulations, he\r\nsays:--\"It is some months since Lord Salisbury made the proposal to me,\r\nand I was beginning to wonder what had happened--whether Cantaur had\r\nput his foot down for example, and objected to bad company.\"] These\r\nthings, I suppose, normally come when one is worn-out. When Lowe was\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer I had a long talk with him about the\r\naffairs of the Natural History Museum, and I told him that he had\r\nbetter put Flower at the head of it and make me a trustee to back him.\r\nBobby no doubt thought the suggestion cheeky, but it is odd that the\r\nthing has come about now that I don't care for it, and desire nothing\r\nbetter than to be out of every description of bother and responsibility.\r\n\r\nHave not Lady Hooker and you yet learned that a large country house is\r\nof all places the most detestable in cold weather? The neuralgia was a\r\nmild and kindly hint of Providence not to do it again, but I am\r\nrejoiced it has vanished.\r\n\r\nPronouns got mixed somehow.\r\n\r\nWith our kindest regards.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nMore last words:--What little faculty I have has been bestowed on the\r\nobituary of Darwin for Royal Society lately. I have been trying to make\r\nit an account of his intellectual progress, and I hope it will have\r\nsome interest. Among other things I have been trying to set out the\r\nargument of the \"Origin of Species,\" and reading the book for the nth\r\ntime for that purpose. It is one of the hardest books to understand\r\nthoroughly that I know of, and I suppose that is the reason why even\r\npeople like Romanes get so hopelessly wrong.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind, I should be glad if you would run your eye over the\r\nthing when I get as far as the proof stage--Lord knows when that will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n[A few days later he wrote again on the same subject, after reading the\r\nobituary of Asa Gray, the first American supporter of Darwin's theory.]\r\n\r\nMarch 23, 1888.\r\n\r\nI suppose Dana has sent you his obituary of Asa Gray.\r\n\r\nThe most curious feature I note in it is that neither of them seems to\r\nhave mastered the principles of Darwin's theory. See the bottom of page\r\n19 and the top of page 20. As I understand Darwin there is nothing\r\n\"Anti-Darwinian\" in either of the two doctrines mentioned.\r\n\r\nDarwin has left the causes of variation and the question whether it is\r\nlimited or directed by external conditions perfectly open.\r\n\r\nThe only serious work I have been attempting lately is Darwin's\r\nobituary. I do a little every day, but get on very slowly. I have read\r\nthe life and letters all through again, and the \"Origin\" for the sixth\r\nor seventh time, becoming confirmed in my opinion that it is one of the\r\nmost difficult books to exhaust that ever was written.\r\n\r\nI have a notion of writing out the argument of the \"Origin\" in\r\nsystematic shape as a sort of primer of Darwinismus. I have not much\r\nstuff left in me, and it would be as good a way of using what there is\r\nas I know of. What do you think?\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In reply to this Sir J. Hooker was inclined to make the biographer\r\nalone responsible for the confusion noted in the obituary of Asa Gray.\r\nHe writes:--\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 1888.\r\n\r\nDear Huxley,\r\n\r\nDana's Gray arrived yesterday, and I turned to pages 19 and 20. I see\r\nnothing Anti-Darwinian in the passages, and I do not gather from them\r\nthat Gray did.\r\n\r\nI did not follow Gray into his later comments on Darwinism, and I never\r\nread his \"Darwiniana.\" My recollection of his attitude after acceptance\r\nof the doctrine, and during the first few years of his active\r\npromulgation of it, is that he understood it clearly, but sought to\r\nharmonise it with his prepossessions, without disturbing its physical\r\nprinciples in any way.\r\n\r\nHe certainly showed far more knowledge and appreciation of the contents\r\nof the \"Origin\" than any of the reviewers and than any of the\r\ncommentators, yourself excepted.\r\n\r\nLatterly he got deeper and deeper into theological and metaphysical\r\nwanderings, and finally formulated his ideas in an illogical fashion.\r\n\r\n...Be all this as it may, Dana seems to be in a muddle on page 20, and\r\nquite a self-sought one.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nJ.D. Hooker.\r\n\r\nThe following is a letter of thanks to Mrs. Humphry Ward for her novel\r\n\"Robert Elsmere.\"]\r\n\r\nBournemouth, March 15, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Ward,\r\n\r\nMy wife thanked you for your book which you were so kind as to send us.\r\nBut that was grace before meat, which lacks the \"physical basis\" of\r\nafter-thanksgiving--and I am going to supplement it, after my most\r\nexcellent repast.\r\n\r\nI am not going to praise the charming style, because that was in the\r\nblood and you deserve no sort of credit for it. Besides, I should be\r\nstepping beyond my last. But as an observer of the human\r\nant-hill--quite impartial by this time--I think your picture of one of\r\nthe deeper aspects of our troubled time admirable.\r\n\r\nYou are very hard on the philosophers. I do not know whether Langham or\r\nthe Squire is the more unpleasant--but I have a great deal of sympathy\r\nwith the latter, so I hope he is not the worst.\r\n\r\nIf I may say so, I think the picture of Catherine is the gem of the\r\nbook. She reminds me of her namesake of Siena--and would as little have\r\nfailed in any duty, however gruesome. You remember Sodoma's picture.\r\n\r\nOnce more, many thanks for a great pleasure.\r\n\r\nMy wife sends her love.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Meanwhile, he had been making no progress towards health; indeed, was\r\ngoing slowly downhill. He makes fun of his condition when writing to\r\ncondole with Mr. Spencer on falling ill again after the unwonted spell\r\nof activity already mentioned; but a few weeks later discovered the\r\ncause of his weakness and depression in an affection of the heart. This\r\nwas not immediately dangerous, though he looked a complete wreck. His\r\nletters from April onwards show how he was forced to give up almost\r\nevery form of occupation, and even to postpone his visit to\r\nSwitzerland, until he had been patched up enough to bear the journey.]\r\n\r\nCasalini, West Cliff, Bournemouth, March 9, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear from Hooker that you have been unwell again.\r\nYou see if young men from the country will go plunging into the\r\ndissipations of the metropolis nemesis follows.\r\n\r\nUntil two days ago, the weather cocks never overstepped North on the\r\none side and East on the other ever since you left. Then they went west\r\nwith sunshine and most enjoyable softness--but next South with a gale\r\nand rain--all ablowin' and agrowin' at this present.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to complain of so long as I do nothing; but although my\r\nhair has grown with its usual rapidity I differ from Samson in the\r\nabsence of a concurrent return of strength. Perhaps that is because a\r\nmale hairdresser, and no Delilah, cut it last! But I waste Biblical\r\nallusions upon you.\r\n\r\nMy wife and Nettie, who is on a visit, join with me in best wishes.\r\n\r\nPlease let me have a line to say how you are--Gladstonianly on a\r\npost-card.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nBournemouth, April 7, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\n\"Let thy servant's face be white before thee.\" The obituary of Darwin\r\nwent to Rix yesterday! [Assistant Secretary of the Royal Society.] It\r\nis not for lack of painstaking if it is not worth much, but I have been\r\nin a bad vein for work of any kind, and I thought I should never get\r\neven this simple matter ended.\r\n\r\nI have been bothered with praecordial uneasiness and intermittent pulse\r\never since I have been here, and at last I got tired of it and went\r\nhome the day before yesterday to get carefully overhauled. Hames tells\r\nme there is weakness and some enlargement of the left ventricle, which\r\nis pretty much what I expected. Luckily the valves are all right.\r\n\r\nI am to go and devote myself to coaxing the left ventricle wall to\r\nthicken pro rata--among the mountains, and to have nothing to do with\r\nany public functions or other exciting bedevilments. So the\r\nInternational Geological Congress will not have the pleasure of seeing\r\nits Honorary President in September. I am disgusted at having to break\r\nan engagement, but I cannot deny that Hames is right. At present the\r\nmere notion of the thing puts me in a funk.\r\n\r\nI wish I could get out of the chair of the M.B.A. Also...I know that\r\nyou and Evans and Dyer will do your best, but you are all eaten up with\r\nother occupations.\r\n\r\nJust turn it over in your mind--there's a dear good fellow--just as if\r\nyou hadn't any other occupations.\r\n\r\nWith which eminently reasonable and unselfish request believe me,\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nBournemouth, April 10, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI send by this post the last--I hope for your sake and for that of the\r\nrecording angel--of --. [The \"Heathen Deutscheree\". A paper of his,\r\ncontributed to the Royal Society, had been under revision.] I agree to\r\nall Brady's suggestions.\r\n\r\nWith all our tinkering I feel inclined to wind up the affair after the\r\nmanner of Mr. Shandy's summing up of the discussion about Tristram's\r\nbreeches--\"And when he has got 'em he'll look a beast in 'em.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[April 12. To the same:--]\r\n\r\nI am quite willing to remain at the M.B.A. till the opening. If Evans\r\nwill be President I shall be happy.\r\n\r\n-- is a very good man, but you must not expect too much of the\r\n\"wild-cat\" element, which is so useful in the world, in him.\r\n\r\nI am disgusted with myself for letting everything go by the run, but\r\nthere is no help for it. The least thing bowls me over just now.\r\n\r\nCasalini, West Cliff, Bournemouth, April 12, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI plead not guilty. [In the matter of sending out no notices for a\r\nmeeting of the x Club.] It was agreed at the last meeting that there\r\nshould be none in April--I suppose by reason of Easter, so I sent no\r\nnotice. This is what Frankland told me in his letter of the 2nd.\r\nHowever, I see you were present, so I can't make it out.\r\n\r\nMy continual absence makes me a shocking bad Treasurer, and I am sorry\r\nto say that things will be worse instead of better. Ever since this\r\nlast pleuritic business I have been troubled with praecordial\r\nuneasiness. [After an account of his symptoms he continues] so I am off\r\n(with my wife) to Switzerland at the end of this month, and shall be\r\naway all the summer. We have not seen the Engadine and Tyrol yet, so we\r\nshall probably make a long circuit. It is a horrid nuisance to be\r\nexiled in this fashion. I have hardly been at home one month in the\r\nlast ten. But it is of no use to growl.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, would you mind looking after the x while I\r\nam away? There is nothing to do but to send the notices on Saturday\r\nprevious to the meeting.\r\n\r\nI am very grieved to hear about Hirst--though to say truth, the way he\r\nhas held out for so long has been a marvel to me. The last news I had\r\nof Spencer was not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nEheu! the \"Table Round\" is breaking up. It's a great pity; we were such\r\npleasant fellows, weren't we?\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nCasalini, West Cliff, Bournemouth, April 18, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI am cheered by your liking of the notice of Darwin. I read the \"Life\r\nand Letters,\" and the \"Origin,\" Krause's \"Life,\" and some other things\r\nover again in order to do it. But I have not much go in me, and I was a\r\nscandalous long time pottering over the writing.\r\n\r\nI have sent the proof back with a variety of interpolations. I would\r\nhave brought the \"Spirula\" notes down here to see what I could do, but\r\nI felt pretty sure that if I brought two things I should not do one.\r\nNobody could do anything with it but myself. I will try what I can do\r\nwhen I go to town. How much time is there before the wind-up of the\r\nChallenger?\r\n\r\nWe go up to town Monday next, and I am thinking of being off the Monday\r\nfollowing (April 30). I have come to the same conclusion as yourself,\r\nthat Glion would be better than Grindelwald. I should like very much to\r\nsee you. Just drop me a line to say when you are likely to turn up.\r\n\r\nPoor Arnold's death has been a great shock [Matthew Arnold died\r\nsuddenly of heart disease at Liverpool, where he had gone to meet his\r\ndaughter on her return from America.]--rather for his wife than\r\nhimself--I mean on her account than his. I have always thought sudden\r\ndeath to be the best of all for oneself, but under such circumstances\r\nit is terrible for those who are left. Arnold told me years ago that he\r\nhad heart disease. I do not suppose there is any likelihood of an\r\nimmediate catastrophe in my own case. I should not go abroad if there\r\nwere. Imagine the horror of leaving one's wife to fight all the\r\ndifficulties of sudden euthanasia in a Swiss hotel! I saw enough of\r\nthat two years ago at Arolla.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, April 25, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nAll my beautiful Swiss plans are knocked on the head--at any rate for\r\nthe present--in favour of horizontality and Digitalis here. The journey\r\nup on Monday demonstrated that travelling, at present, was\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nHames is sanguine I shall get right with rest, and I am quite satisfied\r\nwith his opinion, but for the sake of my belongings he thinks it right\r\nto have Clark's opinion to fortify him.\r\n\r\nIt is a bore to be converted into a troublesome invalid even for a few\r\nweeks, but I comfort myself with my usual reflection on the chances of\r\nlife, \"Lucky it is no worse.\" Any impatience would have been checked by\r\nwhat I heard about Moseley this morning--that he has sunk into hopeless\r\nidiocy. A man in the prime of life!\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 4, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for your note and queries.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing what you say about Darwin's father long ago, I am\r\nnot sure from what source. But if you look at page 20 of the \"Life and\r\nLetters\" you will see that Darwin himself says his father's mind \"was\r\nnot scientific.\" I have altered the passage so as to use these exact\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nI used \"malice\" rather in the French sense, which is more innocent than\r\nours, but \"irony\" would be better if \"malice\" in any way suggests\r\nmalignity. \"Chaff\" is unfortunately beneath the dignity of a Royal\r\nSociety obituary.\r\n\r\nI am going to add a short note about Erasmus Darwin's views.\r\n\r\nIt is a great comfort to me that you like the thing. I am getting\r\nnervous over possible senility--63 to-day, and nothing of your\r\nevergreen ways about me.\r\n\r\nI am decidedly mending, chiefly to all appearance by allowing myself to\r\nbe stuffed with meat and drink like a Strasburg goose. I am also very\r\nmuch afraid that abolishing tobacco has had something to do with my\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nBut I am mindful of your maxim--keep a tight hold over your doctor.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S. 1.--Can't say I have sacrificed anything to penmanship, and am not\r\nat all sure about lucidity!\r\n\r\nP.S. 2.--It is \"Friday\"--there is a dot over the i--reopened my letter\r\nto crow!\r\n\r\n[The following letter to Mr. Spencer is in answer to a note of\r\ncondolence on his illness, in which the following passage occurs:--]\r\n\r\nI was grieved to hear of so serious an evil as that which [Hirst]\r\nnamed. It is very depressing to find one's friends as well as one's\r\nself passing more and more into invalid life.\r\n\r\nWell, we always have one consolation, such as it is, that we have made\r\nour lives of some service in the world, and that, in fact, we are\r\nsuffering from doing too much for our fellows. Such thoughts do not go\r\nfar in the way of mitigation, but they are better than nothing.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 8, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Spencer,\r\n\r\nI have been on the point of writing to you, but put it off for lack of\r\nanything cheerful to say.\r\n\r\nAfter I had recovered from my pleurisy, I could not think why my\r\nstrength did not come back. It turns out that there is some weakness\r\nand dilatation of the heart, but lucky no valvular mischief. I am\r\ncondemned to the life of a prize pig--physical and mental idleness, and\r\ncorporeal stuffing with meat and drink, and I am certainly improving\r\nunder the regimen.\r\n\r\nI am told I have a fair chance of getting all right again. But I take\r\nit as a pretty broad hint to be quiet for the rest of my days. At\r\npresent I have to be very quiet, and I spend most of my time on my back.\r\n\r\nYou and I, my dear friend, have had our innings, and carry our bats out\r\nwhile our side is winning. One could not reasonably ask for more. And\r\nconsidering the infinite possibilities of physical and moral suffering\r\nwhich beset us, I, for my part, am well pleased that things are no\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, N.W., June 1, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI have been living the life of a prize pig for the last six weeks--no\r\nexercise, much meat and drink, and as few manifestations of\r\nintelligence as possible, for the purpose of persuading my heart to\r\nreturn to its duty.\r\n\r\nI am astonished to find that there is a kick left in me--even when your\r\nfriend Kropotkin pitches into me without the smallest justification.\r\nVide 19, June, page 820.\r\n\r\nJust look at 19, February, page 168. I say, \"AT THE PRESENT TIME, the\r\nproduce of the soil does not suffice,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI did not say a word about the capabilities of the soil if, as part and\r\nparcel of a political and social revolution on the grandest scale, we\r\nall took to spade husbandry.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I did try to find out a year or two ago, whether\r\nthe soil of these islands could, under any circumstances, feed its\r\npresent population with wheat. I could not get any definite\r\ninformation, but I understood Caird to think that it could.\r\n\r\nIn my argument, however, the question is of no moment. There must be\r\nsome limit to the production of food by a given area, and there is none\r\nto population.\r\n\r\nWhat a stimulus vanity is!--nothing but the vain dislike of being\r\nthought in the wrong would have induced me to trouble myself or bore\r\nyou with this letter. Bother Kropotkin!\r\n\r\nI think his article very interesting and important nevertheless.\r\n\r\nI am getting better but very slowly.\r\n\r\nEver yours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[In reply, Mr. Knowles begged him to come to lunch and a quiet talk,\r\nand further suggested, \"as an ENTIRELY UNBIASSED person,\" that he ought\r\nto answer Kropotkin's errors in the \"Nineteenth Century,\" and not only\r\nin a private letter behind his back.\r\n\r\nThe answer is as follows:--]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 3, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nYour invitation is tantalising. I wish I could accept it. But it is now\r\nsome six weeks that my excursions have been limited to a daily drive.\r\nThe rest of my time I spend on the flat of my back, eating, drinking,\r\nand doing absolutely nothing besides, except taking iron and digitalis.\r\n\r\nI meant to have gone abroad a month ago, but it turned out that my\r\nheart was out of order, and though I am getting better, progress is\r\nslow, and I do not suppose I shall get away for some weeks yet.\r\n\r\nI have neither brains nor nerves, and the very thought of controversy\r\nputs me in a blue funk!\r\n\r\nMy doctors prophesy good things, as there is no valvular disease, only\r\ndilatation. But for the present I must subscribe myself (from an\r\neditorial point of view).\r\n\r\nYour worthless and useless and bad-hearted friend,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The British Association was to meet at Plymouth this year; and Mr.\r\nW.F. Collier (an uncle of John Collier, his son-in-law) invited Huxley\r\nand any friend of his to be his guest at Horrabridge.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 13, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Collier,\r\n\r\nIt would have been a great pleasure to me to be your guest once more,\r\nbut the Fates won't have it this time.\r\n\r\nDame Nature has given me a broad hint that I have had my innings, and,\r\nfor the rest of my time, must be content to look on at the players.\r\n\r\nIt is not given to all of us to defy the doctors and go in for a new\r\nlease, as I am glad to hear you are doing. I declare that your open\r\ninvitation to any friend of mine is the most touching mark of\r\nconfidence I ever received. I am going to send it to my great ally\r\nMichael Foster, Secretary of the Royal Society. I do not know whether\r\nhe has made any other arrangements, and I am not quite sure whether he\r\nand his wife are going to Plymouth. But I hope they may be able to\r\naccept, for you will certainly like them, and they will certainly like\r\nyou. I will ask him to write directly to you to save time.\r\n\r\nWith very kind remembrances to Mrs. Collier.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that I am mending as fast as I can expect to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.4.\r\n\r\n1888.\r\n\r\n[It was not till June 23 that Huxley was patched up sufficiently by the\r\ndoctors for him to start for the Engadine. His first stage was to\r\nLugano; the second by Menaggio and Colico to Chiavenna; the third to\r\nthe Maloja. The summer visitors who saw him arrive so feeble that he\r\ncould scarcely walk a hundred yards on the level, murmured that it was\r\na shame to send out an old man to die there. Their surprise was the\r\ngreater when, after a couple of months, they saw him walking his ten\r\nmiles and going up two thousand feet without difficulty. As far as his\r\nheart was concerned, the experiment of sending him to the mountains was\r\nperfectly justified. With returning strength he threw himself once more\r\ninto the pursuit of gentians, being especially interested in their\r\ndistribution and hybridism, and the possibility of natural hybrids\r\nexplaining the apparent connecting links between species. No doubt,\r\ntoo, he felt some gratification in learning from his friend Mr. (now\r\nSir W.) Thiselton Dyer, that the results he had already obtained in\r\npursuing this hobby had been of real value:--\r\n\r\nYour important paper \"On Alpine Gentians\" (writes the latter) has begun\r\nto attract the attention of botanists. It has led Baillon, who is the\r\nmost acute of the French people, to make some observations of his own.\r\n\r\nAt the Maloja he stayed twelve weeks, but it was not until nearly two\r\nmonths had elapsed that he could write of any decided improvement,\r\nalthough even then his anticipations for the future were of the\r\ngloomiest. The \"secret\" alluded to in the following letter is the\r\ndestined award to him of the Copley medal:--]\r\n\r\nHotel Kursaal, Maloja, Ober Engadine, August 17, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI know you will be glad to hear that, at last, I can report favourably\r\nof my progress. The first six weeks of our stay here the weather was\r\ncold, foggy, wet, and windy--in short, everything it should not be. If\r\nthe hotel had not been as it is, about the most comfortable in\r\nSwitzerland, I do not know what I should have done. As it was, I got a\r\nvery bad attack of \"liver,\" which laid me up for ten days or so. A\r\nBrighton doctor--Bluett by name, and well up to his work--kindly looked\r\nafter me.\r\n\r\nWith the early days of August the weather changed for the better, and\r\nfor the last fortnight we have had perfect summer--day after day. I\r\nsoon picked up my walking power, and one day got up to Lake Longhin,\r\nabout 2000 feet up. That was by way of an experiment, and I was none\r\nthe worse for it, but usually my walks are of a more modest\r\ndescription. To-day we are all clouds and rain, and my courage is down\r\nto zero, with praecordial discomfort. It seems to me that my heart is\r\nquite strong enough to do all that can reasonably be required of it--if\r\nall the rest of the machinery is in good order, and the outside\r\nconditions are favourable. But the poor old pump cannot contend with\r\ngrit or want of oil anywhere.\r\n\r\nI mean to stay here as long as I can; they say it is often very fine up\r\nto the middle of September. Then we shall migrate lower, probably on\r\nthe Italian side, and get home most likely in October. But I really am\r\nvery much puzzled to know what to do.\r\n\r\nMy wife has not been very well lately, and Ethel has contrived to\r\nsprain her ankle at lawn-tennis. Collier has had to go to Naples, but\r\nwe expect him back in a few days.\r\n\r\nWith our united love to Mrs. Foster and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI was very pleased to hear of a secret my wife communicated to me. So\r\nlong as I was of any use, I did not care much about having the fact\r\nrecognised, but now that I am used up I like the feather in my cap.\r\n\"Fuimus.\" Let us have some news of you.\r\n\r\n[Sir M. Foster, who was kept in England by the British Association till\r\nSeptember 10, wrote that he was going abroad for the rest of September,\r\nand proposed to spend some time at Menaggio, whence he hoped to effect\r\na meeting. He winds up with a jest at his recent unusual\r\noccupation:--\"I have had no end of righteousness accounted to me for\r\nhelping to entertain Bishops at Cambridge.\" Hence the postcript in\r\nreply:--]\r\n\r\nHotel Kursaal, Maloja, September 2, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nA sharp fall of snow has settled our minds, which have been long\r\nwavering about future plans, and we leave this for Menaggio, Hotel\r\nVittoria, on Thursday next, 6th. [He did not ultimately leave till the\r\n22nd.]\r\n\r\nAll the wiseacres tell us that there are fresher breezes (vento di\r\nLecco) at Menaggio than anywhere else in the Como country, and at any\r\nrate we are going to try whether we can exist there. If it does not\r\nanswer, we will leave a note for you there to say where we are gone. It\r\nwould be very jolly to forgather.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to leave this most comfortable of hotels, but I do not think\r\nthat cold would suit either of us. I am marvellously well so long as I\r\nam taking sharp exercise, and I do my nine or ten miles without\r\nfatigue. It is only when I am quiet that I know that I have a heart.\r\n\r\nI do not feel at all sure how matters may be 4000 feet lower, but what\r\nI have gained is all to the good in the way of general health. In spite\r\nof all the bad weather we have had, I have nothing but praise for this\r\nplace--the air is splendid, excellent walks for invalids, capital\r\ndrainage, and the easiest to reach of all places 6000 feet up.\r\n\r\nMy wife sends her love, and thanks Mrs. Foster for her letter, and\r\nlooks forward to meeting her.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nWash yourself clean of all that episcopal contamination or you may\r\ninfect me!\r\n\r\n[But adverse circumstances prevented the meeting.]\r\n\r\nHotel Kursaal, Maloja, September 24, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nAs ill luck would have it, we went over to Pontresina to-day (for the\r\nfirst time), and have only just got back (5.30). I have just\r\ntelegraphed to you.\r\n\r\nAll our plans have been upset by the Fohn wind, which gave us four\r\ndays' continuous downpour here--upset the roads, and flooded the\r\nChiavenna to Colico Railway. We hear that the latter is not yet\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\nI was going to write to you at the Vittoria, but thought you could have\r\nhardly got there yet. We took rooms there a week ago, and then had to\r\ncountermand them. If there are any letters kicking about for us, will\r\nyou ask them to send them on?\r\n\r\nBy way of an additional complication, my poor wife gave herself an\r\nunlucky strain this morning, and even if the railway is mended I do not\r\nthink she will be fit to travel for two or three days. We are very\r\ndisappointed. What is to be done?\r\n\r\nI am wonderfully better. So long as I am taking active exercise and the\r\nweather is dry, I am quite comfortable, and only discover that I have a\r\nheart when I am kept quiet by bad weather or get my liver out of order.\r\nHere I can walk nine or ten miles up hill and down dale without\r\ndifficulty or fatigue. What I may be able to do elsewhere is doubtful.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nIt would do you and Mrs. Foster a great deal of good to come up here.\r\nNot out of your way at all! Oh dear no!\r\n\r\nZurich, October 4, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI should have written to you at Stresa, but I had mislaid your\r\npostcard, and it did not turn up till too late.\r\n\r\nWe made up our minds after all that we would as soon not go down to the\r\nLakes--where the ground would be drying up after the inundations--so we\r\nwent the other way over the Julier to Tiefenkasten, and from T. to\r\nRagatz, where we stayed a week. Ragatz was hot and steamy at\r\nfirst--cold and steamy afterwards--but earlier in the season, I should\r\nthink, it would be pleasant.\r\n\r\nLast Monday we migrated here, and have had the vilest weather until\r\nto-day. All yesterday it rained cats and dogs.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are off to Neuhausen (Schweitzerhof) to have a look at the\r\nRhine falls. If it is pleasant we may stop there a few days. Then we go\r\nto Stuttgart, on our way to Nuremberg, which neither of us have seen.\r\nWe shall be at the \"Bavarian Hotel,\" and a letter will catch us there,\r\nif you have anything to say, I daresay up to the middle of the month.\r\nAfter that Frankfort, and then home.\r\n\r\nWe do not find long railway journeys very good for either of us, and I\r\nam trying to keep within six hours at a stretch.\r\n\r\nI am not so vigorous as I was at Maloja, but still infinitely better\r\nthan when I left England.\r\n\r\nI hope the mosquitoes left something of you in Venice. When I was there\r\nin October there were none!\r\n\r\nMy wife joins with me in love to Mrs. Foster and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Some friendly chaff in Sir M. Foster's reply to the latter contains at\r\nleast a real indication of the way in which Huxley became the centre of\r\nthe little society at the Maloja:--]\r\n\r\nYou may reflect that you have done the English tourists a good service\r\nthis summer. At most table d'hotes in the Lakes I overheard people\r\ntalking about the joys of Maloja, and giving themselves great airs on\r\naccount of their intimacy with \"Professor Huxley\"!!\r\n\r\n[But indeed he made several friends here, notably one in an unexpected\r\nquarter. This was Father Steffens, Professor of Palaeography in\r\nFreiburg University, resident Catholic priest at Maloja in the summer,\r\nwith whom he had many discussions, and whose real knowledge of the\r\ncritical questions confronting Christian theology he used to contrast\r\nwith the frequent ignorance and occasional rudeness of the English\r\nrepresentatives of that science who came to the hotel.\r\n\r\nA letter to Mr. Spencer from Ragatz shows him on his return journey:--]\r\n\r\nIn fact, so long as I was taking rather sharp exercise in sunshine I\r\nfelt quite well, and I could walk as well as any time these ten years.\r\nIt needed damp cold weather to remind me that my pumping apparatus was\r\nnot to be depended upon under unfavourable conditions. Four thousand\r\nfeet descent has impressed that fact still more forcibly upon me, and I\r\nam quite at sea as to what it will be best to do when we return. Quite\r\ncertainly, however, we shall not go to Bournemouth. I like the place,\r\nbut the air is too soft and moist for either of us.\r\n\r\nI should be very glad if we could be within reach of you and help to\r\ncheer you up, but I cannot say anything definite at present about our\r\nwinter doings...\r\n\r\nMy wife sends her kindest regards. She is much better than when we\r\nleft, which is lucky for me, as I have no mind, and could not make it\r\nup if I had any. The only vigour I have is in my legs, and that only\r\nwhen the sun shines.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A curious incident on this journey deserves recording, as an instance\r\nof a futile \"warning.\" On the night of October 6-7, Huxley woke in the\r\nnight and seemed to hear an inward voice say, \"Don't go to Stuttgart\r\nand Nuremberg; go straight home.\" All he did was to make a note of the\r\noccurrence and carry out his original plan, whereupon nothing happened.\r\n\r\nThe following to his youngest daughter, who had gone back earlier from\r\nthe Maloja, refers to her success in winning the prize for modelling at\r\nthe Slade School of Art.]\r\n\r\nSchweitzerhof, Neuhausen, October 7, 1888.\r\n\r\nDearest Babs,\r\n\r\nI will sit to you like \"Pater on a monument smiling at grief\" for the\r\nmedallion. As to the photographs, I will try to get them done to order\r\neither at Stuttgart or Nuremberg, if we stay at either place long\r\nenough. But I am inclined to think they had better be done at home, and\r\nthen you could adjust the length of the caoutchouc visage to suit your\r\nartistic convenience.\r\n\r\nWe have been crowing and flapping our wings over the medal and\r\ntrimmings. The only thing I lament is that \"your father's influence\"\r\nwas not brought to bear; there is no telling what you might have got if\r\nit had been. Thoughtless--very!!\r\n\r\nSo sorry we did not come here instead of stopping at Ragatz. The falls\r\nare really fine, and the surrounding country a wide tableland, with the\r\ngreat snowy peaks of the Oberland on the horizon. Last evening we had a\r\nbrilliant sunset, and the mountains were lighted up with the most\r\ndelicate rosy blush you can imagine.\r\n\r\nTo-day it rains cats and dogs again. You will have seen in the papers\r\nthat the Rhine and the Aar and the Rhone and the Arve are all in flood.\r\nThere is more water here in the falls than there has been these ten\r\nyears. However, we have got to go, as the hotel shuts up to-morrow, and\r\nthere seems a good chance of reaching Stuttgart without water in the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nLong railway journeys do not seem to suit either of us, and we have\r\nfixed the maximum at six hours. I expect we shall be home some time in\r\nthe third week of this month.\r\n\r\nLove to Hal and anybody else who may be at home.\r\n\r\nEver your Pater.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, October 20, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nWe got back on Thursday, and had a very good passage, and took it easy\r\nby staying the night at Dover. The \"Lord Warden\" gave us the worst\r\ndinner we have had for four months, at double the price of the good\r\ndinners. I wonder why we cannot manage these things better in England.\r\n\r\nWe are both very glad to be at home again, and trust we may be allowed\r\nto enjoy our own house for a while. But, oh dear, the air is not\r\nMalojal! not even at Hempstead, whither I walked yesterday, and the\r\npump labours accordingly.\r\n\r\nI found the first part of the fifth edition of the Text-book among the\r\ntwo or three hundredweight of letters and books which had accumulated\r\nduring four months. Gratulire!\r\n\r\nBy the way, South Kensington has sent me some inquiry about\r\nExaminations, which I treat with contempt, as doubtless you have a\r\nduplicate.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[On October 25 he announces his return to Sir Joseph Hooker, and\r\nlaments his loss of vigour at the sea-level:--]\r\n\r\nHames won't let me stay here in November, and I think we shall go to\r\nBrighton. Unless on the flat of my back, in bed, I shall not have been\r\nat home a month all this year.\r\n\r\nI have been utterly idle. There was a lovely case of hybridism,\r\nGentiana lutea and G. punctata, in a little island in the lake of Sils;\r\nbut I fell ill and was confined to bed just after I found it out. It\r\nwould be very interesting if somebody would work out Distribution five\r\nmiles round the Maloja as a centre. There are the most curious local\r\ndifferences.\r\n\r\nYou asked me to send you a copy of my obituary of Darwin. So I put one\r\nherewith, though no doubt you have seen it in the \"Proceedings of the\r\nRoyal Society.\"\r\n\r\nI should like to know what you think of 17 to 27. If ever I am able to\r\ndo anything again I will enlarge on these heads.\r\n\r\n[In these pages of the Obituary Notice (\"Proceedings of the Royal\r\nSociety\" 44 Number 269) he endeavours:--]\r\n\r\nto separate the substance of the theory from its accidents, and to show\r\nthat a variety, not only of hostile comments, but of friendly would-be\r\nimprovements lose their raison d'etre to the careful student...\r\n\r\nIt is not essential to Darwin's theory that anything more should be\r\nassumed than the facts of heredity, variation, and unlimited\r\nmultiplication; and the validity of the deductive reasoning as to the\r\neffect of the last (that is, of the struggle for existence which it\r\ninvolves) upon the varieties resulting from the operation of the\r\nformer. Nor is it essential that one should take up any particular\r\nposition in regard to the mode of variation, whether, for example, it\r\ntakes place per saltum or gradually; whether it is definite in\r\ncharacter or indefinite. Still less are those who accept the theory\r\nbound to any particular views as to the causes of heredity or of\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\n[The remaining letters of the year trace the gradual bettering of\r\nhealth, from the \"no improvement\" of October to the almost complete\r\ndisappearance of bad symptoms in December. He had renounced Brighton,\r\nwhich he detested, in favour of Eastbourne, where the keen air of the\r\ndowns and the daily walk over Beachy Head acted as a tolerable\r\nsubstitute for the Alps. Though he would not miss the anniversary\r\nmeeting of the Royal Society, when he was to receive the Copley medal,\r\none more link binding him to his old friend Hooker, he did not venture\r\nto stay for the dinner in the evening.\r\n\r\nThis autumn also he resigned his place on the board of Governors of\r\nEton College.] \"I think it must be a year and a half,\" [he writes,]\r\n\"since I attended a meeting, and I am not likely to do better in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, October 28, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for your suggestion about the cottage, namely \"that before\r\nyou decide on Brighton Mrs. Huxley should come down and look at the\r\ncottage below my house\" at Sunningdale, but I do not see my way to\r\nadopting it. A house, however small, involves servants and ties one to\r\none place. The conditions that suit me do not seem to be found anywhere\r\nbut in the high Alps, and I can't afford to keep a second house in the\r\ncountry and pass the summer in Switzerland as well.\r\n\r\nWe are going to Brighton (not because we love it, quite t'other) on\r\naccount of the fine weather that is to be had there in November and\r\nDecember. We shall be back for some weeks about Christmas, and then get\r\naway somewhere else--Malvern possibly--out of the east winds of\r\nFebruary and March.\r\n\r\nI do not like this nomadic life at all, but it appears to be Hobson's\r\nchoice between that and none.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear you are troubled by your ears. I am so deaf that I\r\nbegin to fight shy of society. It irritates me not to hear; it\r\nirritates me still more to be spoken to as if I were deaf, and the\r\nabsurdity of being irritated on the last ground irritates me still\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nI wish you would start that business of giving a competent young\r\nbotanist with good legs 100 pounds to go and study distribution in the\r\nEngadine--from the Maloja as centre--in a circle of a radius of eight\r\nor ten miles. The distribution of the four principal conifers, Arolla\r\npine, larch, mountain pine and spruce, is most curious, the why and\r\nwherefore nowise apparent.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry I cannot be at x on Thursday, but they won't let me be\r\nout at night at present.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, October 28, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nNo fear of my trying to stop in London. Hames won't have it. He came\r\nand overhauled me the other day. As I expected, the original mischief\r\nis just as it was. One does not get rid either of dilatation or its\r\nresults at my time of life. The only thing is to keep the pipes clear\r\nby good conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nAfter endless discussion we have settled on Brighton for November and\r\nDecember. It is a hateful place to my mind, but there is more chance of\r\nsunshine there (at this time) than anywhere else. We shall come up for\r\na week or two on this side of Christmas, and then get away somewhere\r\nelse out of the way of the east winds of February and March.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the Hazlemere country would do for us, nor indeed\r\nany country place so long as we cannot regularly set up house.\r\n\r\nHeaven knows I don't want to bother about anything at present. But I\r\nshould like to convince -- that he does not yet understand the elements\r\nof his subject. What a copious ink-spilling cuttlefish of a writer he\r\nis!\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, London, N.W., November 2, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Skelton,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for the second volume of \"Maitland of Lethington.\" I have\r\nbeen in the Engadine for the last four months, trying to repair the\r\ncrazy old \"house I live in,\" and meeting with more success than I hoped\r\nfor when I left home.\r\n\r\nYour volume turned up amidst a mountain of accumulated books, papers,\r\nand letters, and I can only hope it has not been too long without\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested in your argument about the \"Casket\r\nletters.\" The comparison of Crawford's deposition with the Queen's\r\nletter leaves no sort of doubt that the writer of one had the other\r\nbefore him; and under the circumstances I do not see how it can be\r\ndoubted that the Queen's letter is forged.\r\n\r\nBut though thus wholly agreeing with you in substance, I cannot help\r\nthinking that your language on page 341 may be seriously pecked at.\r\n\r\nMy experience of reporters leads me to think that there would be no\r\ndiscrepancy at all comparable to that between the two accounts, and I\r\nspeak from the woeful memories of the many Royal Commissions I have\r\nwearied over. The accuracy of a good modern reporter is really\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nAnd I do not think that \"the two documents were drawn by the same\r\nhand.\" I should say that the writer of the letter had Crawford's\r\ndeposition before him, and made what he considered improvements here\r\nand there.\r\n\r\nYou will say this letter is like Falstaff's reckoning, with but a\r\npennyworth of thanks to this monstrous quantity of pecking.\r\n\r\nBut the gratitude is solid and the criticism mere two-dimension stuff.\r\nIt is a charming book.\r\n\r\nWith kind remembrances to Mrs. Skelton.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n10 Southcliff Terrace, Eastbourne, November 9, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nWe came here on Tuesday, on which day, by ill luck, the east wind also\r\nstarted, and has been blowing half a gale ever since. We are in the\r\nlast house but one to the west, and as high up as we dare go--looking\r\nout on the sea. The first day we had to hold on to our chairs to\r\nprevent being blown away in the sitting-room, but we have hired a\r\nscreen and can now croon over the fire without danger.\r\n\r\nA priori, the conditions cannot be said to have been promising for two\r\npeople, one of whom is liable to bronchitis and rheumatism and the\r\nother to pleurisy, but, as I am so fond of rubbing into Herbert\r\nSpencer, a priori reasonings are mostly bosh, and we are thriving.\r\n\r\nWith three coats on I find the air on Beachy Head eminently refreshing,\r\nand there is so much light in the southern quarter just now, that we\r\nconfidently hope to see the sun once more in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\nAs I told you in my official letter, I am going up for the 30th. But I\r\nam in a quandary about the dinner, partly by reason of the inevitable\r\nspeech, and partly the long sitting. I should very much like to attend,\r\nand I think I could go through with it. On the other hand, my wife\r\ndeclares it would be very imprudent, and I am not quite sure she is\r\nwrong. I wish you would tell me exactly what you think about the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe way I pick up directly I get into good air makes me suspect myself\r\nof malingering, and yet I certainly had grown very seedy in London\r\nbefore we left.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n10 Southcliff Terrace, Eastbourne, November 13, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nWe are very sorry to hear about Michael Junior. [Sir M. Foster's son\r\nwas threatened with lung trouble, and was ordered to live abroad. He\r\nproposed to carry his medical experience to the Maloja and practise\r\nthere during the summer. Huxley offered to give him some\r\nintroductions.] Experto crede; of all anxieties the hardest to bear is\r\nthat about one's children. But considering the way you got off yourself\r\nand have become the hearty and bucolic person you are, I think you\r\nought to be cheery. Everybody speaks well of the youngster, and he is\r\nbound to behave himself well and get strong as swiftly as possible.\r\n\r\nThough very loth, I give up the dinner. But unless I am on my back I\r\nshall turn up at the meeting. I think that is a compromise very\r\ncreditable to my prudence.\r\n\r\nThough it is blowing a gale of wind from south-west to-day there is\r\nreal sunshine, and it is fairly warm. I am very glad we came here\r\ninstead of that beastly Brighton.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n10 Southcliff Terrace, Eastbourne, November 15, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Evans,\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to have missed you. I told my doctor that while the\r\nweather was bad it was of no use to go away, and when it was fine I\r\nmight just as well stop at home; but he did not see the force of my\r\nreasoning, and packed us off here.\r\n\r\nThe award of the Copley is a kindness I feel very much...\r\n\r\nThe Congress [The International Geological Congress, at which he was to\r\nhave presided.] seems to have gone off excellently. I consider that my\r\nown performance of the part of dummy was distinguished.\r\n\r\nSo the Lawes business is fairly settled at last! \"Lawes Deo,\" as the\r\nClaimant might have said. But the pun will be stale, as you doubtless\r\nhave already made all possible epigrams and punnigrams on the topic.\r\n\r\nMy wife joins with me in kindest regards to Mrs. Evans and yourself. If\r\nMrs. Evans had only come up to the Maloja, she would have had real\r\nwinter and no cold.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n10 Southcliff Terrace, Eastbourne, November 15, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou would have it that the Royal Society broke the law in giving you\r\nthe Copley, and they certainly violated custom in giving it to me the\r\nyear following. Whoever heard of two biologers getting it one after\r\nanother? It is very pleasant to have our niches in the Pantheon close\r\ntogether. It is getting on for forty years since we were first\r\n\"acquent,\" and considering with what a very considerable dose of\r\ntenacity, vivacity, and that glorious firmness (which the beasts who\r\ndon't like us call obstinacy) we are both endowed, the fact that we\r\nhave never had the shadow of a shade of a quarrel is more to our credit\r\nthan being ex-Presidents and Copley medallists.\r\n\r\nBut we have had a masonic bond in both being well salted in early life.\r\nI have always felt I owed a great deal to my acquaintance with the\r\nrealities of things gained in the old \"Rattlesnake\".\r\n\r\nI am getting on pretty well here, though the weather has been mostly\r\nbad. All being well I shall attend the meeting of the Society on the\r\n30th, but not the dinner. I am very sorry to miss the latter, but I\r\ndare not face the fatigue and the chances of a third dose of pleurisy.\r\n\r\nMy wife sends kindest regards and thanks for your congratulations.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n10 Southcliff Terrace, Eastbourne, November 17, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Flower,\r\n\r\n...Many thanks for taking my troublesomeness in good part. My friend\r\nwill be greatly consoled to know that you have the poor man \"in your\r\neye.\" Schoolmaster, naturalist, and coal merchant used to be the three\r\nrefuges for the incompetent. Schoolmaster is rapidly being eliminated,\r\nso I suppose the pressure on Natural History and coals will increase.\r\n\r\nI am glad you have got the Civil Service Commissioners to listen to\r\ncommon sense. I had an awful battle with them (through the Department)\r\nover Newton, who is now in your paleontological department. If I\r\nrecollect rightly, they examined him inter alia on the working of the\r\nPoor Laws!\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society has dealt very kindly with me. They patted me on the\r\nback when I started thirty-seven years ago, and it was a great\r\nencouragement. They give me their best, now that my race is run, and it\r\nis a great consolation. At the far end of life all one's work looks so\r\nuncommonly small, that the good opinion of one's contemporaries\r\nacquires a new value.\r\n\r\nWe have a summer's day, and I am writing before an open window!\r\nYesterday it blew great guns.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letter to Lady Welby, the point of which is that to be\r\n\"morally convinced\" is not the same thing as to offer scientific proof,\r\nrefers to an article in the \"Church Quarterly\" for October called\r\n\"Truthfulness in Science and Religion,\" evoked by Huxley's \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury\" article on \"Science and the Bishops.\"]\r\n\r\nNovember 27, 1888.\r\n\r\nDear Lady Welby,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the article in the \"Church Quarterly\", which I return\r\nherewith. I am not disposed to bestow any particular attention upon it;\r\nas the writer, though evidently a fair-minded man, appears to me to be\r\nentangled in a hopeless intellectual muddle, and one which has no\r\nnovelty. Christian beliefs profess to be based upon historical facts.\r\nIf there was no such person as Jesus of Nazareth, and if His biography\r\ngiven in the Gospels is a fiction, Christianity vanishes.\r\n\r\nNow the inquiry into the truth or falsehood of a matter of history is\r\njust as much a question of pure science as the inquiry into the truth\r\nor falsehood of a matter of geology, and the value of evidence in the\r\ntwo cases must be tested in the same way. If any one tells me that the\r\nevidence of the existence of man in the miocene epoch is as good as\r\nthat upon which I frequently act every day of my life, I reply that\r\nthis is quite true, but that it is no sort of reason for believing in\r\nthe existence of miocene man.\r\n\r\nSurely no one but a born fool can fail to be aware that we constantly,\r\nand in very grave conjunctions, are obliged to act upon extremely bad\r\nevidence, and that very often we suffer all sorts of penalties in\r\nconsequence. And surely one must be something worse than a born fool to\r\npretend that such decision under the pressure of the enigmas of life\r\nought to have the smallest influence in those judgments which are made\r\nwith due and sufficient deliberation. You will see that these\r\nconsiderations go to the root of the whole matter. I regret that I\r\ncannot discuss the question more at length and deal with sundry topics\r\nput forward in your letter. At present writing is a burden to me.\r\n\r\n[A letter to Professor Ray Lankester mixes grave and gay in a little\r\nhomily, edged by personal experience, on the virtues and vices of\r\ncombativeness.]\r\n\r\n10 Southcliff Terrace, Eastbourne, December 6, 1888.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a very good thing both for you and for Oxford if\r\nyou went there. Oxford science certainly wants stirring up, and\r\nnotwithstanding your increase in years and wisdom, I think you would\r\nbear just a little more stirring down, so that the conditions for a\r\ntransfer of energy are excellent!\r\n\r\nSeriously, I wish you would let an old man, who has had his share of\r\nfighting, remind you that battles, like hypotheses, are not to be\r\nmultiplied beyond necessity. Science might say to you as the\r\nStaffordshire collier's wife said to her husband at the fair, \"Get thee\r\nfoighten done and come whoam.\" You have a fair expectation of ripe\r\nvigour for twenty years; just think what may be done with that capital.\r\n\r\nNo use to tu quoque me. Under the circumstances of the time, warfare\r\nhas been my business and duty.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Two more letters of the year refer to the South Kensington\r\nexaminations, for which Huxley was still nominally responsible. As\r\nbefore, we see him reluctant to sign the report upon papers which he\r\nhad not himself examined; yet at the same time doing all that lay in\r\nhis power to assist by criticising the questions and thinking out the\r\nscheme of teaching on which the examination was to be based. He replies\r\nto some proposed changes in a letter to Sir M. Foster of December 12:--]\r\n\r\nI am very sorry I cannot agree with your clients about the examination.\r\nThey should recollect the late Master of Trinity's aphorism that even\r\nthe youngest of us is not infallible.\r\n\r\nI know exactly upon what principles I am going, and so far as I am at\r\npresent informed that advantage is peculiar to my side. Two points I am\r\nquite clear about--one is the exclusion of Amphioxus, and the other the\r\nretention of so much of the Bird as will necessitate a knowledge of\r\nSauropsidan skeletal characters and the elements of skeletal homologies\r\nin skull and limbs.\r\n\r\nI have taken a good deal of pains over drawing up a new\r\nsyllabus--including dogfish--and making room for it by excluding\r\nAmphioxus and all of bird except skeleton. I have added Lamprey\r\n(cranial and spinal skeleton, NOT face cartilages), so that the\r\nintelligent student may know what a notochord means before he goes to\r\nembryology. I have excluded Distoma and kept Helix.\r\n\r\nThe Committee must now settle the matter. I have done with it.\r\n\r\n[On December 27 he writes:--]\r\n\r\nI have been thinking over the Examinership business without coming to\r\nany very satisfactory result. The present state of things is not\r\nsatisfactory so far as I am concerned. I do not like to appear to be\r\ndoing what I am not doing.\r\n\r\n-- would of course be the successor indicated, if he had not so\r\ncarefully cut his own throat as an Examiner...He would be bringing an\r\naction against the Lord President before he had been three years in\r\noffice!...As I told Forster, when he was Vice-President, the whole\r\nvalue of the Examiner system depends on the way the examiners do their\r\nwork. I have the gravest doubt about -- steadily plodding through the\r\ndisgustful weariness of it as you and I have done, or observing any\r\nregulation that did not suit his fancy.\r\n\r\n[With this may be compared the letter of May 19, 1889, to Sir J.\r\nDonnelly, when he finally resolved to give up the \"sleeping\r\npartnership\" in the examination.\r\n\r\nHis last letter of the year was written to Sir J. Hooker, when\r\ntransferring to him the \"archives\" of the x Club, as the new Treasurer.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, December 29, 1888.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nAll good wishes to you and yours, and many of them.\r\n\r\nThanks for the cheque. You are very confiding to send it without\r\nlooking at the account. But I have packed up the \"Archives,\" which poor\r\ndear Busk handed over to me, and will leave them at the Athenaeum for\r\nyou. Among them you will find the account book. There are two or three\r\ncases, when I was absent, in which the names are not down. I have no\r\ndoubt Frankland gave them to me by letter, but the book was at home and\r\nthey never got set down. Peccavi!\r\n\r\nI have been picking up in the most astonishing way during the last\r\nfortnight or three weeks at Eastbourne. My doctor, Hames, carefully\r\nexamined my heart yesterday, and told me that though some slight\r\nindications were left, he should have thought nothing of them if he had\r\nnot followed the whole history of the case. With fresh air and exercise\r\nand careful avoidance of cold and night air I am to be all right again\r\nin a few months.\r\n\r\nI am not fond of coddling; but as Paddy gave his pig the best corner in\r\nhis cabin--because \"shure, he paid the rint\"--I feel bound to take care\r\nof myself as a household animal of value, to say nothing of any other\r\ngrounds. So, much as I should like to be with you all on the 3rd, I\r\nmust defer to the taboo.\r\n\r\nThe wife got a nasty bronchitic cold as soon as she came up. She is\r\nmuch better now. But I shall be glad to get her down to Eastbourne\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nExcept that, we are all very flourishing, as I hope you are.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.5.\r\n\r\n1889.\r\n\r\n[The events to be chronicled in this year are, as might be expected,\r\neither domestic or literary. The letters are full of allusions to his\r\nlong controversy in defence of Agnosticism, mainly with Dr. Wace, who\r\nhad declared the use of the name to be a \"mere evasion\" on the part of\r\nthose who ought to be dubbed infidels (Apropos of this controversy, a\r\nletter may be cited which appeared in the \"Agnostic Annual\" for 1884,\r\nin answer to certain inquiries from the editor as to the right\r\ndefinition of Agnosticism:--]\r\n\r\nSome twenty years ago, or thereabouts, I invented the word \"Agnostic\"\r\nto denote people who, like myself, confess themselves to be hopelessly\r\nignorant concerning a variety of matters, about which metaphysicians\r\nand theologians, both orthodox and heterodox, dogmatise with the utmost\r\nconfidence, and it has been a source of some amusement to me to watch\r\nthe gradual acceptance of the term and its correlate, \"Agnosticism\" (I\r\nthink the \"Spectator\" first adopted and popularised both), until now\r\nAgnostics are assuming the position of a recognised sect, and\r\nAgnosticism is honoured by especial obloquy on the part of the\r\northodox. Thus it will be seen that I have a sort of patent right in\r\n\"Agnostic\" (it is my trade mark), and I am entitled to say that I can\r\nstate authentically what was originally meant by Agnosticism. What\r\nother people may understand by it, by this time, I do not know. If a\r\nGeneral Council of the Church Agnostic were held, very likely I should\r\nbe condemned as a heretic. But I speak only for myself in answering\r\nthese questions.\r\n\r\n1. Agnosticism is of the essence of science, whether ancient or modern.\r\nIt simply means that a man shall not say he knows or believes that\r\nwhich he has no scientific grounds for professing to know or believe.\r\n\r\n2. Consequently Agnosticism puts aside not only the greater part of\r\npopular theology, but also the greater part of popular anti-theology.\r\nOn the whole, the \"bosh\" of heterodoxy is more offensive to me than\r\nthat of orthodoxy, because heterodoxy professes to be guided by reason\r\nand science, and orthodoxy does not.\r\n\r\n3. I have no doubt that scientific criticism will prove destructive to\r\nthe forms of supernaturalism which enter into the constitution of\r\nexisting religions. On trial of any so-called miracle the verdict of\r\nscience is \"Not proven.\" But true Agnosticism will not forget that\r\nexistence, motion, and law-abiding operation in nature are more\r\nstupendous miracles than any recounted by the mythologies, and that\r\nthere may be things, not only in the heavens and earth, but beyond the\r\nintelligible universe, which \"are not dreamt of in our philosophy.\" The\r\ntheological \"gnosis\" would have us believe that the world is a\r\nconjurer's house; the anti-theological \"gnosis\" talks as if it were a\r\n\"dirt-pie,\" made by the two blind children, Law and Force. Agnosticism\r\nsimply says that we know nothing of what may be behind phenomena.); [to\r\nthe building of the new house at Eastbourne, and to the marriage in\r\nquick succession of his two youngest daughters, whereby, indeed, the\r\ngiving up of the house in London and definite departure from London was\r\nmade possible.\r\n\r\nAll the early part of the year, till he found it necessary to go to\r\nSwitzerland again, he stayed unwillingly in Eastbourne, from time to\r\ntime running up to town, or having son or daughter to stay with him for\r\na week, his wife being too busy to leave town, with the double\r\npreparations for the weddings on hand, so that he writes to her:] \"I\r\nfeel worse than the 'cowardly agnostic' I am said to be--for leaving\r\nyou to face your botherations alone.\" [One can picture him still firm\r\nof tread, with grizzled head a little stooped from his square\r\nshoulders, pacing the sea wall with long strides, or renewing somewhat\r\nof his strength as it again began to fail, in the keener air of the\r\ndowns, warmly defended against chill by a big cap--for he had been\r\nsuffering from his ears--and a long rough coat. He writes (February\r\n22):] \"I have bought a cap with flaps to protect my ears. I look more\r\n'doggy' than ever.\" [And on March 3:--]\r\n\r\nWe have had a lovely day, quite an Italian sky and sea, with a good\r\ndeal of Florentine east wind. I walked up to the Signal House, and was\r\ngreatly amused by a young sheep-dog whose master could hardly get him\r\naway from circling round me and staring at me with a short dissatisfied\r\nbark every now and then. It is the undressed wool of my coat bothers\r\nall the dogs. They can't understand why a creature which smells so like\r\na sheep should walk on its hind legs. I wish I could have relieved that\r\ndog's mind, but I did not see my way to an explanation.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, the effects of several years' comparative rest\r\nbecame more perceptible. His slowly returning vigour was no longer\r\nsapped by the unceasing strain of multifarious occupations. And if his\r\nrecurrent ill-health sometimes seems too strongly insisted on, it must\r\nbe remembered that he had always worked at the extreme limit of his\r\npowers--the limit, as he used regretfully to say, imposed on his brain\r\nby his other organs--and that after his first breakdown he was never\r\nvery far from a second. When this finally came in 1884, his forces were\r\nso far spent that he never expected to recover as he did.\r\n\r\nIn the marriage this year of his youngest daughter, Huxley was doomed\r\nto experience the momentary little twinge which will sometimes come to\r\nthe supporter of an unpopular principle when he first puts it into\r\npractice among his own belongings.\r\n\r\nAthenaeum Club, January 14, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just left the x \"Archives\" here for you. I left them on my table\r\nby mischance when I came here on the x day.\r\n\r\nI have a piece of family news for you. My youngest daughter Ethel is\r\ngoing to marry John Collier.\r\n\r\nI have always been a great advocate for the triumph of common sense and\r\njustice in the \"Deceased Wife's Sister\" business--and only now\r\ndiscover, that I had a sneaking hope that all of my own daughters would\r\nescape that experiment!\r\n\r\nThey are quite suited to one another and I would not wish a better\r\nmatch for her. And whatever annoyances and social pin-pricks may come\r\nin Ethel's way, I know nobody less likely to care about them.\r\n\r\nWe shall have to go to Norway, I believe, to get the business done.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, my wife (who has been laid up with bronchitic cold\r\never since we came home) and I have had as much London as we can stand,\r\nand are off to-morrow to Eastbourne again, but to more sheltered\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nI hope Lady Hooker and you are thriving. Don't conceal the news from\r\nher, as my wife is always accusing me of doing.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. W.F. Collier.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, January 24, 1889.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your kind letter. I have as strong an affection for\r\nJack as if he were my own son, and I have felt very keenly the ruin we\r\ninvoluntarily brought upon him--by our poor darling's terrible illness\r\nand death. So that if I had not already done my best to aid and abet\r\nother people in disregarding the disabilities imposed by the present\r\nmonstrous state of the law, I should have felt bound to go as far as I\r\ncould towards mending his life. Ethel is just suited to him...Of course\r\nI could have wished that she should be spared the petty annoyances\r\nwhich she must occasionally expect. But I know of no one less likely to\r\ncare for them.\r\n\r\nYour Shakespere parable is charming--but I am afraid it must be put\r\namong the endless things that are read IN to the \"divine Williams\" as\r\nthe Frenchman called him. [The second part of the letter replies to the\r\nquestion whether Shakespeare had any notion of the existence of the\r\nsexes in plants and the part played in their fertilisation by insects,\r\nwhich, of course, would be prevented from visiting them by rainy\r\nweather, when he wrote in the \"Midsummer Night's Dream\":--\r\n\r\nThe moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye,\r\nAnd when she weeps, weeps every little flower\r\nLamenting some enforced chastity.]\r\n\r\nThere was no knowledge of the sexes of plants in Shakespere's time,\r\nbarring some vague suggestion about figs and dates. Even in the 18th\r\ncentury, after Linnaeus, the observations of Sprengel, who was a man of\r\ngenius, and first properly explained the action of insects, were set\r\naside and forgotten.\r\n\r\nI take it that Shakespere is really alluding to the \"enforced chastity\"\r\nof Dian (the moon). The poets ignore that little Endymion business when\r\nthey like!\r\n\r\nI have recovered in such an extraordinary fashion that I can plume\r\nmyself on being an \"interesting case,\" though I am not going to compete\r\nwith you in that line. And if you look at the February \"Nineteenth\" I\r\nhope you will think that my brains are none the worse. But perhaps that\r\nconceited speech is evidence that they are.\r\n\r\nWe came to town to make the acquaintance of Nettie's fiance, and I am\r\nhappy to say the family takes to him. When it does not take to anybody,\r\nit is the worse for that anybody.\r\n\r\nSo, before long, my house will be empty, and as my wife and I cannot\r\nlive in London, I think we shall pitch our tent in Eastbourne. Good\r\nJack offers to give us a pied-a-terre when we come to town. To-day we\r\nare off to Eastbourne again. Carry off Harry, who is done up from too\r\nzealous Hospital work. However, it is nothing serious.\r\n\r\nThe following is in reply to a request that he would write a letter, as\r\nhe describes it elsewhere, \"about the wife's sister business--for the\r\nedification of the peers.\"\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, March 12, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nI feel \"downright mean,\" as the Yankees say, that I have not done for\r\nthe sake of right and justice what I am moved to do now that I have a\r\npersonal interest in the matter of the directest kind; and I rather\r\nexpect that will be thrown in my teeth if my name is at the bottom of\r\nanything I write.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I loathe anonymity. However, we can take time to\r\nconsider that point.\r\n\r\nAnyhow I will set to work on the concoction of a letter, if you will\r\nsupply me with the materials which will enable me to be thoroughly\r\nposted up in the facts.\r\n\r\nI have just received your second letter. Pity you could not stay over\r\nyesterday--it was very fine.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The letter in question is as follows:--]\r\n\r\nApril 30, 1889.\r\n\r\nDear Lord Hartington,\r\n\r\nI am assured by those who know more about the political world than I\r\ndo, that if Lord Salisbury would hold his hand and let his party do as\r\nthey like about the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill which is to come on\r\nnext week, it would pass. Considering the irritation against the\r\nbishops and a certain portion of the lay peers among a number of people\r\nwho have the means of making themselves heard and felt, which is kept\r\nup and aggravated, as time goes on, by the action of the Upper House in\r\nrepeatedly snubbing the Lower, about this question, I should have\r\nthought it (from a Conservative point of view) good policy to heal the\r\nsore.\r\n\r\nThe talk of Class versus Mass is generally mere clap-trap; but, in this\r\ncase, there is really no doubt that a fraction of the Classes stands in\r\nthe way of the fulfilment of a very reasonable demand on the part of\r\nthe Masses.\r\n\r\nA clear-headed man like Lord Salisbury would surely see this if it were\r\nproperly pressed on his attention.\r\n\r\nI do not presume to say whether it is practicable or convenient for the\r\nLeader of the Liberal Unionist party to take any steps in this\r\ndirection; and I should hardly have ventured to ask you to take this\r\nsuggestion into consideration if the interest I have always taken in\r\nthe D.W.S. Bill had not recently been quickened by the marriage of one\r\nof my daughters as a Deceased Wife's Sister.\r\n\r\nI am, etc.\r\n\r\n[Meantime the effect of Eastbourne, which Sir John Donnelly had induced\r\nhim to try, was indeed wonderful. He found in it the place he had so\r\nlong been looking for. References to his health read very differently\r\nfrom those of previous years. He walked up Beachy Head regularly\r\nwithout suffering from any heart symptoms. And though Beachy Head was\r\nnot the same thing as the Alps, it made a very efficient substitute for\r\na while, and it was not till April that the need of change began to\r\nmake itself felt. And so he made up his mind to listen no more to the\r\neager friends who wished him to pitch his tent near them at either end\r\nof Surrey, but to settle down at Eastbourne, and, by preference, to\r\nbuild a house of the size and on the spot that suited himself, rather\r\nthan to take any existing house lower down in the town. He must have\r\nbeen a trifle irritated by unsolicited advice when he wrote the\r\nfollowing:--]\r\n\r\nIt is very odd that people won't give one credit for common sense. We\r\nhave tried one winter here, and if we tried another we should be just\r\nas much dependent upon the experience of longer residents as ever we\r\nwere. However, as I told X. I was going to settle matters to-morrow,\r\nthere won't be any opportunity for discussing that topic when he comes.\r\nIf we had taken W.'s house, somebody would have immediately told us\r\nthat we had chosen the dampest site in winter and the stuffiest in\r\nsummer, and where, moreover, the sewage has to be pumped up into the\r\nmain drain.\r\n\r\n[He finally decided upon a site on the high ground near Beachy Head, a\r\nlittle way back from the sea front, at the corner of the Staveley and\r\nBuxton Roads, with a guarantee from the Duke of Devonshire's agent that\r\nno house should be built at the contiguous end of the adjoining plot of\r\nland in the Buxton Road, a plot which he himself afterwards bought. The\r\nprincipal rooms were planned for the back of the house, looking\r\nsouth-west over open gardens to the long line of downs which culminate\r\nin Beachy Head, but with due provision against southerly gales and\r\nexcess of sunshine.\r\n\r\nOn May 29 the builder's contract was accepted, and for the rest of the\r\nyear the progress of the house, which was designed by his son-in-law,\r\nF.W. Waller, afforded a constant interest.\r\n\r\nMeantime, with the improvement in his general health, the old appetite\r\nfor work returned with increased and unwonted zest. For the first time\r\nin his life he declares that he enjoyed the process of writing. As he\r\nwrote somewhat later to his newly married daughter from Eastbourne,\r\nwhere he had gone again very weary the day after her wedding: \"Luckily\r\nthe bishops and clergy won't let me alone, so I have been able to keep\r\nmyself pretty well amused in replying.\" The work which came to him so\r\neasily and pleasurably was the defence of his attitude of agnosticism\r\nagainst the onslaught made upon it at the previous Church Congress by\r\nDr. Wace, the Principal of King's College, London, and followed up by\r\narticles in the \"Nineteenth Century\" from the pen of Mr. Frederic\r\nHarrison and Mr. Laing, the effect of which upon him he describes to\r\nMr. Knowles on December 30, 1888:--]\r\n\r\nI have been stirred up to the boiling pitch by Wace, Laing, and\r\nHarrison in re Agnosticism, and I really can't keep the lid down any\r\nlonger. Are you minded to admit a goring article into the February\r\n\"Nineteenth\"?\r\n\r\n[As for his health, he adds:--]\r\n\r\nI have amended wonderfully in the course of the last six weeks, and my\r\ndoctor tells me I am going to be completely patched up--seams caulked\r\nand made seaworthy, so the old hulk may make another cruise.\r\n\r\nWe shall see. At any rate I have been able and willing to write lately,\r\nand that is more than I can say for myself for the first three-quarters\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n...I was so pleased to see you were in trouble about your house. Good\r\nfor you to have a taste of it for yourself.\r\n\r\n[To this controversy he contributed four articles; three directly in\r\ndefence of Agnosticism, the fourth on the value of the underlying\r\nquestion of testimony to the miraculous.\r\n\r\nThe first article, \"Agnosticism,\" appeared in the February number of\r\nthe \"Nineteenth Century\". No sooner was this finished than he began a\r\nfresh piece of work, \"which,\" he writes, \"is all about miracles, and\r\nwill be rather amusing.\" This, on the \"Value of Testimony to the\r\nMiraculous,\" appeared in the following number of the \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury\". It did not form part of the controversy on hand, though it\r\nbore indirectly upon the first principles of agnosticism. The question\r\nat issue, he urges, is not the possibility of miracles, but the\r\nevidence to their occurrence, and if from preconceptions or ignorance\r\nthe evidence be worthless the historical reality of the facts attested\r\nvanishes. The cardinal point, then, \"is completely, as the author of\r\nRobert Elsmere says, the value of testimony.\"\r\n\r\n[The March number also contained replies from Dr. Wace and Bishop Magee\r\non the main question, and an article by Mrs. Humphry Ward on a kindred\r\nsubject to his own, \"The New Reformation.\" Of these he writes on\r\nFebruary 27:--]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop and Wace are hammering away in the \"Nineteenth\". Mrs. Ward's\r\narticle very good, and practically an answer to Wace. Won't I stir them\r\nup by and by.\r\n\r\n[And a few days later:--]\r\n\r\nMrs. Ward's service consists in her very clear and clever exposition of\r\ncritical results and methods.\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, February 29, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI have just been delighted with Mrs. Ward's article. She has swept away\r\nthe greater part of Wace's sophistries as a dexterous and\r\nstrong-wristed housemaid sweeps away cobwebs with her broom, and saved\r\na lot of time.\r\n\r\nWhat in the world does the Bishop mean by saying that I have called\r\nChristianity \"sorry stuff\" (page 370)? To my knowledge I never so much\r\nas thought anything of the kind, let alone saying it.\r\n\r\nI shall challenge him very sharply about this, and if, as I believe, he\r\nhas no justification for his statement, my opinion of him will be very\r\nconsiderably lowered.\r\n\r\nWace has given me a lovely opening by his profession of belief in the\r\ndevils going into the swine. I rather hoped I should get this out of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI find people are watching the game with great interest, and if it\r\nshould be possible for me to give a little shove to the \"New\r\nReformation,\" I shall think the fag end of my life well spent.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the reproach made to the English people that \"they care for\r\nnothing but religion and politics\" is rather to their credit. In the\r\nlong run these are the two things that ought to interest a man more\r\nthan any others.\r\n\r\nI have been much bothered with ear-ache lately, but if all goes well I\r\nwill send you a screed by the middle of March.\r\n\r\nSnowing hard! They have had more snow within the last month than they\r\nhave known for ten years here.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He set to work immediately, and within ten days despatched his second\r\ncontribution, \"Agnosticism, a Rejoinder,\" which appeared in the April\r\nnumber of the \"Nineteenth Century\".\r\n\r\nOn March 3 he writes:--]\r\n\r\nI am possessed by a writing demon, and have pretty well finished in the\r\nrough another article for Knowles, whose mouth is wide open for it.\r\n\r\n[And on the 9th:--]\r\n\r\nI sent off another article to Knowles last night--a regular facer for\r\nthe clericals. You can't think how I enjoy writing now for the first\r\ntime in my life.\r\n\r\n[He writes at greater length to Mr. Knowles]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, March 10, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nThere's a Divinity that shapes the ends (of envelopes!) rough-hew them\r\nhow we will. This time I went and bought the strongest to be had, and\r\nsealed him up with wax in the shop. I put no note inside, meaning to\r\nwrite to you afterwards, and then I forgot to do so.\r\n\r\nI can't understand Peterborough nohow. However, so far as the weakness\r\nof the flesh would permit me to abstain from smiting him and his\r\nbrother Amalekite, I have tried to turn the tide of battle to matters\r\nof more importance.\r\n\r\nThe pith of my article is the proposition that Christ was not a\r\nChristian. I have not ventured to state my thesis exactly in that\r\nform--fearing the Editor--but, in a mild and proper way, I flatter\r\nmyself I have demonstrated it. Really, when I come to think of the\r\nclaims made by orthodox Christianity on the one hand, and of the total\r\nabsence of foundation for them on the other, I find it hard to abstain\r\nfrom using a phrase which shocked me very much when Strauss first\r\napplied it to the Resurrection, \"Welthistorischer Humbug!\"\r\n\r\nI don't think I have ever seen the portrait you speak of. I remember\r\nthe artist--a clever fellow, whose name, of course, I forget--but I do\r\nnot think I saw his finished work. Some of these days I will ask to see\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was pretty well finished after the wedding, and bolted here the next\r\nday. I am sorry to say I could not get my wife to come with me. If she\r\ndoes not knock up I shall be pleasantly surprised. The young couple are\r\nflourishing in Paris. I like what I have seen of him very much.\r\n\r\nWhat is the \"Cloister scheme\"? [It referred to a plan for using the\r\ncloisters of Westminster Abbey to receive the monuments of\r\ndistinguished men, so as to avoid the necessity of enlarging the Abbey\r\nitself.] Recollect how far away I am from the world, the flesh and the\r\nd--.\r\n\r\nAre you and Mrs. Knowles going to imitate the example of Eginhard and\r\nEmma? What good pictures you will have in your monastery church!\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And again, a few days later:--]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne; March 15, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI am sending my proof back to Spottiswoode's. I did not think the\r\nmanuscript would make so much, and I am afraid it has lengthened in the\r\nprocess of correction.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a reader in your printer's office who provides me with jokes.\r\nLast time he corrected, where my manuscript spoke of the pigs as\r\nunwilling \"porters\" of the devils, into \"porkers.\" And this time, when\r\nI, writing about the Lord's Prayer, say \"current formula,\" he has it\r\n\"canting formula.\" If only Peterborough had got hold of that! And I am\r\ncapable of overlooking anything in a proof.\r\n\r\nYou see we have got to big questions now, and if these are once fairly\r\nbefore the general mind all the King's horses and all the King's men\r\nwon't put the orthodox Humpty Dumpty where he was before.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[After the article came out he wrote again to Mr. Knowles:--]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, N.W., April 14, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI am going to try and stop here, desolate as the house is now all the\r\nchicks have flown, for the next fortnight. Your talk of the inclemency\r\nof Torquay is delightfully consoling. London has been vile.\r\n\r\nI am glad you are going to let Wace have another \"go.\" My object, as\r\nyou know, in the whole business has been to rouse people to think...\r\n\r\nConsidering that I got named in the House of Commons last night as an\r\nexample of a temperate and well-behaved blasphemer, I think I am\r\nattaining my object. [In the debate upon the Religious Prosecutions\r\nAbolition Bill, Mr. Addison said \"the last article by Professor Huxley\r\nin the \"Nineteenth Century\" showed that opinion was free when it was\r\nhonestly expressed.\"--\"Times\" April 14.]\r\n\r\nOf course I go for a last word, and I am inclined to think that\r\nwhatever Wace may say, it may be best to get out of the region of\r\ncontroversy as far as possible and hammer in two big nails--(1) that\r\nthe Demonology of Christianity shows that its founders knew no more\r\nabout the spiritual world than anybody else, and (2) that Newman's\r\ndoctrine of \"Development\" is true to an extent of which the Cardinal\r\ndid not dream.\r\n\r\nI have been reading some of his works lately, and I understand now why\r\nKingsley accused him of growing dishonesty.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or two of him I began to lose sight of the distinction\r\nbetween truth and falsehood.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nIf you are at home any day next week I will look in for a chat.\r\n\r\n[The controversy was completed by a third article, \"Agnosticism and\r\nChristianity,\" in the June number of the \"Nineteenth Century\". There\r\nwas a humorous aspect of this article which tickled his fancy\r\nimmensely, for he drove home his previous arguments by means of an\r\nauthority whom his adversaries could not neglect, though he was the\r\nlast man they could have expected to see brought up against them in\r\nthis connection--Cardinal Newman. There is no better evidence for\r\nancient than for modern miracles, he says in effect; let us therefore\r\naccept the teachings of the Church which maintains a continuous\r\ntradition on the subject. But there is a very different conclusion to\r\nbe drawn from the same premises; all may be regarded as equally\r\ndoubtful, and so he writes on May 30 to Sir J. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nBy the way, I want you to enjoy my wind-up with Wace in this month's\r\n\"Nineteenth\" in the reading as much as I have in the writing. It's as\r\nfull of malice [I.e. in the French sense of the word.] as an egg is\r\nfull of meat, and my satisfaction in making Newman my accomplice has\r\nbeen unutterable. That man is the slipperiest sophist I have ever met\r\nwith. Kingsley was entirely right about him.\r\n\r\nNow for peace and quietness till after the next Church Congress!\r\n\r\n[Three other letters to Mr. Knowles refer to this article.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, N.W., May 4, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI am at the end of my London tether, and we go to Eastbourne (3\r\nJevington Gardens again) on Monday.\r\n\r\nI have been working hard to finish my paper, and shall send it to you\r\nbefore I go.\r\n\r\nI am astonished at its meekness. Being reviled, I revile not; not an\r\nexception, I believe, can be taken to the wording of one of the\r\nvenomous paragraphs in which the paper abounds. And I perceive the\r\ntruth of a profound reflection I have often made, that reviling is\r\noften morally superior to not reviling.\r\n\r\nI give up Peterborough. His \"Explanation\" is neither straightforward,\r\nnor courteous, nor prudent. Of which last fact, it may be, he will be\r\nconvinced when he reads my acknowledgment of his favours, which is\r\nsoft, not with the softness of the answer which turneth away wrath, but\r\nwith that of the pillow which smothered Desdemona.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI shall try to stand an hour or two of the Academy dinner, and hope it\r\nwon't knock me up.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, N.W., May 6, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nIf I had not gone to the Academy dinner I might have kept my promise\r\nabout sending you my paper to-day. I indulged in no gastronomic\r\nindiscretions, and came away after H.R.H.'s speech, but I was dead beat\r\nall yesterday, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nWe are off to Eastbourne, and I will send the manuscript from there;\r\nthere is very little to do.\r\n\r\nSuch a waste! I shall have to omit a paragraph that was really a\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nFor who should I come upon in one of the rooms but the Bishop! As we\r\nshook hands, he asked whether that was before the fight or after; and I\r\nanswered, \"A little of both.\" Then we spoke our minds pretty plainly;\r\nand then we agreed to bury the hatchet. [As he says (\"Collected Essays\"\r\n5 210), this chance meeting ended \"a temporary misunderstanding with a\r\nman of rare ability, candour, and wit, for whom I entertained a great\r\nliking and no less respect.\"]\r\n\r\nSo yesterday I tore up THE paragraph. It was so appropriate I could not\r\neven save it up for somebody else!\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, May 22, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI sent back my proof last evening. I shall be in town Friday afternoon\r\nto Monday morning next, having a lot of things to do. So you may as\r\nwell let me see a revise of the whole. Did you not say to me, \"sitting\r\nby a sea-coal fire\" (I say nothing about a \"parcel gilt goblet\"), that\r\nthis screed was to be the \"last word\"? I don't mind how long it goes on\r\nso long as I have the last word. But you must expect nothing from me\r\nfor the next three or four months. We shall be off abroad, not later\r\nthan the 8th June, and among the everlasting hills, a fico for your\r\ncontroversies! Wace's paper shall be waste paper for me. Oh! This is a\r\n\"goak\" which Peterborough would not understand.\r\n\r\nI think you are right about the wine and water business--I had my\r\ndoubts--but it was too tempting. All the teetotalers would have been on\r\nmy side.\r\n\r\nThere is no more curious example of the influence of education than the\r\nrespect with which this poor bit of conjuring is regarded. Your genuine\r\npietist would find a mystical sense in thimblerig. I trust you have\r\nproperly enjoyed the extracts from Newman. That a man of his intellect\r\nshould be brought down to the utterance of such drivel--by Papistry, is\r\none of the strongest of arguments against that damnable perverter of\r\nmankind, I know of.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Shortly afterwards, he received a long and rambling letter in\r\nconnection with this subject. Referring to the passage in the first\r\narticle, \"the apostolic injunction to 'suffer fools gladly' should be\r\nthe rule of life of a true agnostic,\" the writer began by begging him\r\n\"to 'suffer gladly' one fool more,\" and after several pages wound up\r\nwith a variation of the same phrase. It being impossible to give any\r\nvalid answer to his hypothetical inquiries, Huxley could not resist the\r\ntemptation to take the opening thus offered him, and replied:--]\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI beg leave to acknowledge your letter. I have complied with the\r\nrequest preferred in its opening paragraph.\r\n\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letter also arises out of this controversy:--\r\n\r\nIts occasion (writes Mr. Taylor) was one which I had written on seeing\r\nan article in which he referred to the Persian sect of the Babis. I had\r\nread with much interest the account of it in Count Gobineau's book, and\r\nwas much struck with the points of likeness to the foundation of\r\nChristianity, and the contrast between the subsequent history of the\r\ntwo; I asked myself how, given the points of similarity, to account for\r\nthe contrast; is it due to the Divine within the one, or the human\r\nsurroundings? This question I put to Professor Huxley, with many\r\napologies for intruding on his leisure, and a special request that he\r\nwould not suffer himself to be further troubled by any reply.]\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Robert Taylor.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, N.W., June 8, 1889.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIn looking through a mass of papers, before I leave England for some\r\nmonths among the mountains in search of health, I have come upon your\r\nletter of 7th March. As a rule I find that out of the innumerable\r\nletters addressed to me, the only ones I wish to answer are those the\r\nwriters of which are considerate enough to ask that they may receive no\r\nreply, and yours is no exception.\r\n\r\nThe question you put is very much to the purpose: a proper and full\r\nanswer would take up many pages; but it will suffice to furnish the\r\nheads to be filled up by your own knowledge.\r\n\r\n1. The Church founded by Jesus has NOT made its way; has NOT permeated\r\nthe world--but DID become extinct in the country of its birth--as\r\nNazarenism and Ebionism.\r\n\r\n2. The Church that did make its way and coalesced with the State in the\r\n4th century had no more to do with the Church founded by Jesus than\r\nUltramontanism has with Quakerism. It is Alexandrian Judaism and\r\nNeoplatonistic mystagogy, and as much of the old idolatry and\r\ndemonology as could be got in under new or old names.\r\n\r\n3. Paul has said that the Law was schoolmaster to Christ with more\r\ntruth than he knew. Throughout the Empire the synagogues had their\r\ncloud of Gentile hangers-on--those who \"feared God\"--and who were fully\r\nprepared to accept a Christianity which was merely an expurgated\r\nJudaism and the belief in Jesus as the Messiah.\r\n\r\n4. The Christian \"Sodalitia\" were not merely religious bodies, but\r\nfriendly societies, burial societies, and guilds. They hung together\r\nfor all purposes--the mob hated them as it now hates the Jews in\r\nEastern Europe, because they were more frugal, more industrious, and\r\nlived better lives than their neighbours, while they stuck together\r\nlike Scotchmen.\r\n\r\nIf these things are so--and I appeal to your knowledge of history that\r\nthey are so--what has the success of Christianity to do with the truth\r\nor falsehood of the story of Jesus?\r\n\r\nI am, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letter was written in reply to one from Mr. Clodd on the\r\nfirst of the articles in this controversy. This article, it must be\r\nremembered, not only replied to Dr. Wace's attack, but at the same time\r\nbantered Mr. Frederic Harrison's pretensions on behalf of Positivism at\r\nthe expense alike of Christianity and Agnosticism.]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, February 19, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Clodd,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for your cheery and appreciative letter.\r\nIf I do not empty all Harrison's vials of wrath I shall be astonished!\r\nBut of all the sickening humbugs in the world, the sham pietism of the\r\nPositivists is to me the most offensive.\r\n\r\nI have long been wanting to say my say about these questions, but my\r\nhands were too full. This time last year I was so ill that I thought to\r\nmyself, with Hamlet, \"the rest is silence.\" But my wiry constitution\r\nhas unexpectedly weathered the storm, and I have every reason to\r\nbelieve that with renunciation of the devil and all his works (i.e.\r\npublic speaking, dining and being dined, etc.) my faculties may be\r\nunimpaired for a good spell yet. And whether my lease is long or short,\r\nI mean to devote them to the work I began in the paper on the Evolution\r\nof Theology.\r\n\r\nYou will see in the next \"Nineteenth\" a paper on the Evidence of\r\nMiracles, which I think will be to your mind.\r\n\r\nHutton is beginning to drivel! There really is no other word for it.\r\n[This refers to an article in the \"Spectator\" on \"Professor Huxley and\r\nAgnosticism,\" February 9, 1889, which suggests, with regard to demoniac\r\npossession, that the old doctrine of one spirit driving out another is\r\nas good as any new explanation, and fortifies this conclusion by a\r\nreference to the phenomena of hypnotism.]\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[To the same:--]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, April 15, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Clodd,\r\n\r\nThe adventurous Mr. C. wrote to me some time ago. I expressed my regret\r\nthat I could do nothing for the evolution of tent-pegs. What wonderful\r\npeople there are in the world!\r\n\r\nMany thanks for calling my attention to \"Antiqua Mater.\" I will look it\r\nup. I have such a rooted objection to returning books, that I never\r\nborrow one or allow anybody to lend me one if I can help it.\r\n\r\nI hear that Wace is to have another innings, and I am very glad of it,\r\nas it will give me the opportunity of putting the case once more as a\r\nconnected argument.\r\n\r\nIt is Baur's great merit to have seen that the key to the problem of\r\nChristianity lies in the Epistle to the Galatians. No doubt he and his\r\nfollowers rather overdid the thing, but that is always the way with\r\nthose who take up a new idea.\r\n\r\nI have had for some time the notion of dealing with the \"Three great\r\nmyths\"--1. Creation; 2. Fall; 3. Deluge; but I suspect I am getting to\r\nthe end of my tether physically, and shall have to start for the\r\nEngadine in another month's time.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your congratulations about my daughter's marriage. No\r\ntwo people could be better suited for one another, and there is a\r\ncharming little grand-daughter of the first marriage to be cared for.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[One more piece of writing dates from this time. He writes to his wife\r\non March 2:--]\r\n\r\nA man who is bringing out a series of portraits of celebrities, with a\r\nsketch of their career attached, has bothered me out of my life for\r\nsomething to go with my portrait, and to escape the abominable bad\r\ntaste of some of the notices, I have done that. I shall show it you\r\nbefore it goes back to Engel in proof.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of his life is the brief autobiography which is printed at\r\nthe beginning of volume 1 of the \"Collected Essays\". He was often\r\npressed, both by friends and by strangers, to give them some more\r\nautobiography; but moved either by dislike of any approach to egotism,\r\nor by the knowledge that if biography is liable to give a false\r\nimpression, autobiography may leave one still more false, he constantly\r\nrefused to do so, especially so long as he had capacity for useful\r\nwork. I found, however, among his papers, an entirely different sketch\r\nof his early life, half-a-dozen sheets describing the time he spent in\r\nthe East end, with an almost Carlylean sense of the horrible\r\ndisproportions of life. I cannot tell whether this was a first draft\r\nfor the present autobiography, or the beginnings of a larger\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters of miscellaneous interest were written before the move\r\nto the Engadine took place. They touch on such points as the excessive\r\ngrowth of scientific clubs, the use of alcohol for brain workers,\r\nadvice to one who was not likely to \"suffer fools gladly\" about\r\napplying for the assistant secretaryship of the British Association,\r\nand the question of the effects of the destruction of immature fish,\r\nbesides personal matters.]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, March 22, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI suppose the question of amalgamation with the Royal is to be\r\ndiscussed at the Phil. Club. The sooner something of the kind takes\r\nplace the better. There is really no raison d'etre left for the Phil.\r\nClub, and considering the hard work of scientific men in these days,\r\nclubs are like hypotheses, not to be multiplied beyond necessity.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, March 26, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe only science to which X. has contributed, so far as I know, is the\r\nscience of self-advertisement; and of that he is a master.\r\n\r\nWhen you and I were youngsters, we thought it the great thing to\r\nexorcise the aristocratic flunkeyism which reigned in the Royal\r\nSociety--the danger now is that of the entry of seven devils worse than\r\nthe first, in the shape of rich engineers, chemical traders, and\r\n\"experts\" (who have sold their souls for a good price), and who find it\r\nhelps them to appear to the public as if they were men of science.\r\n\r\nIf the Phil Club had kept pure, it might have acted as a check upon the\r\nintrusion of the mere trading element. But there seems to be no reason\r\nnow against Jack and Tom and Harry getting in, and the thing has become\r\nan imposture.\r\n\r\nSo I go with you for extinction, before we begin to drag in the mud.\r\n\r\nI wish I could take some more active part in what is going on. I am\r\nanxious about the Society altogether. But though I am wonderfully well\r\nso long as I live like a hermit, and get out into the air of the Downs,\r\neither London, or bother, and still more both combined, intimate\r\nrespectfully but firmly, that my margin is of the narrowest.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following is to his daughter in Paris. Of course it was the\r\nTuileries, not the Louvre, which was destroyed in 1871.]\r\n\r\nI think you are quite right about French women. They are like French\r\ndishes, uncommonly well cooked and sent up, but what the dickens they\r\nare made of is a mystery. Not but what all womenkind are mysteries, but\r\nthere are mysteries of godliness and mysteries of iniquity.\r\n\r\nHave you been to see the sculptures in the Louvre?--dear me, I forgot\r\nthe Louvre's fate. I wonder where the sculpture is? I used to think it\r\nthe best thing in the way of art in Paris. There was a youthful Bacchus\r\nwho was the main support of my thesis as to the greater beauty of the\r\nmale figure!\r\n\r\nProbably I had better conclude.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. E.T. Collings (of Bolton).\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, April 9, 1889.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI understand that you ask me what I think about \"alcohol as a stimulant\r\nto the brain in mental work\"?\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself (and perhaps I may add for persons of my\r\ntemperament), I can say, without hesitation, that I would just as soon\r\ntake a dose of arsenic as I would of alcohol, under such circumstances.\r\nIndeed on the whole, I should think the arsenic safer, less likely to\r\nlead to physical and moral degradation. It would be better to die\r\noutright than to be alcoholised before death.\r\n\r\nIf a man cannot do brain work without stimulants of any kind, he had\r\nbetter turn to hand work--it is an indication on Nature's part that she\r\ndid not mean him to be a head worker.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of my life have led me to experience all sorts of\r\nconditions in regard to alcohol, from total abstinence to nearly the\r\nother end of the scale, and my clear conviction is the less the better,\r\nthough I by no means feel called upon to forgo the comforting and\r\ncheering effect of a little.\r\n\r\nBut for no conceivable consideration would I use it to whip up a tired\r\nor sluggish brain. Indeed, for me there is no working time so good as\r\nbetween breakfast and lunch, when there is not a trace of alcohol in my\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 6, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI meant to have turned up at the x on Thursday, but I was unwell and,\r\nmoreover, worried and bothered about Collier's illness at Venice, and\r\nawaiting an answer to a telegram I sent there. He has contrived to get\r\nscarlatina, but I hope he will get safe through it, as he seems to be\r\ngoing on well. We were getting ready to go out until we were reassured\r\non that point.\r\n\r\nI thought I would go to the Academy dinner on Saturday, and that if I\r\ndid not eat and drink and came away early, I might venture.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant enough to have a glimpse of the world, the flesh (on\r\nthe walls, nude!), and the devil (there were several Bishops), but oh,\r\ndear! how done I was yesterday.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are off to Eastbourne to-day, and I hope to wash three\r\nweeks' London out of me before long. I think we shall go to Maloja\r\nagain early in June.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nCapital portrait in the New Gallery, where I looked in for a quarter of\r\nan hour on Saturday--only you never were quite so fat in the cheeks,\r\nand I don't believe you have got such a splendid fur-coat!\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, May 22, 1889.\r\n\r\n...As to the Assistant Secretaryship of the British Association, I have\r\nturned it over a great deal in my mind since your letter reached me,\r\nand I really cannot convince myself that you would suit it or it would\r\nsuit you. I have not heard who are candidates or anything about it, and\r\nI am not going to take any part in the election. But looking at the\r\nthing solely from the point of view of your interests, I should\r\nstrongly advise you against taking it, even if it were offered.\r\n\r\nMy pet aphorism \"suffer fools gladly\" should be the guide of the\r\nAssistant Secretary, who, during the fortnight of his activity, has\r\nmore little vanities and rivalries to smooth over and conciliate than\r\nother people meet with in a lifetime. Now you do NOT \"suffer fools\r\ngladly\" on the contrary, you \"gladly make fools suffer.\" I do not say\r\nyou are wrong--No tu quoque [Cf. above. But for due cause he could\r\nsuffer them \"with a difference\"; of a certain caller he writes: \"What\r\nan effusive bore he is! But I believe he was very kind to poor\r\nClifford, and restrained my unregenerate impatience of that kind of\r\ncreature.\"]--but that is where the danger of the explosion lies--not in\r\nregard to the larger business of the Association.\r\n\r\nThe risk is great and the 300 pounds a year is not worth it. Foster\r\nknows all about the place; ask him if I am not right.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the suggestion about Spirula. But the matter is in a\r\nstate in which no one can be of any use but myself. At present I am at\r\nthe end of my tether and I mean to be off to the Engadine a fortnight\r\nhence--most likely not to return before October.\r\n\r\nNot even the sweet voice of -- will lure me from my retirement. The\r\nAcademy dinner knocked me up for three days, though I drank no wine,\r\nate very little, and vanished after the Prince of Wales' speech. The\r\ntruth is I have very little margin of strength to go upon even now,\r\nthough I am marvellously better than I was.\r\n\r\nI am very glad that you see the importance of doing battle with the\r\nclericals. I am astounded at the narrowness of view of many of our\r\ncolleagues on this point. They shut their eyes to the obstacles which\r\nclericalism raises in every direction against scientific ways of\r\nthinking, which are even more important than scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nI desire that the next generation may be less fettered by the gross and\r\nstupid superstitions of orthodoxy than mine has been. And I shall be\r\nwell satisfied if I can succeed to however small an extent in bringing\r\nabout that result.\r\n\r\nI am, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 25, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lankester,\r\n\r\nI cannot attend the Council meeting on the 29th. I have a meeting of\r\nthe Trustees of the British Museum to-day, and to be examined by a\r\nCommittee on Monday, and as the sudden heat half kills me I shall be\r\nfit for nothing but to slink off to Eastbourne again.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do hope the Council will be very careful what they say or do\r\nabout the immature fish question. The thing has been discussed over and\r\nover again ad nauseam, and I doubt if there is anything to be added to\r\nthe evidence in the blue-books.\r\n\r\nThe idee fixe of the British public, fishermen, M.P.'s and ignorant\r\npersons generally is that all small fish, if you do not catch them,\r\ngrow up into big fish. They cannot be got to understand that the\r\nwholesale destruction of the immature is the necessary part of the\r\ngeneral order of things, from codfish to men.\r\n\r\nYou seem to have some very interesting things to talk about at the\r\nRoyal Institution.\r\n\r\nDo you see any chance of educating the white corpuscles of the human\r\nrace to destroy the theological bacteria which are bred in parsons?\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, May 19, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President's letter has brought home to me one thing very\r\nclearly, and that is, that I had no business to sign the Report. Of\r\ncourse he has a right to hold me responsible for a document to which my\r\nname is attached, and I should look more like a fool than I ever wish\r\nto do, if I had to tell him that I had taken the thing entirely on\r\ntrust. I have always objected to the sleeping partnership in the\r\nExamination; and unless it can be made quite clear that I am nothing\r\nbut a \"consulting doctor,\" I really must get out of it entirely.\r\n\r\nOf course I cannot say whether the Report is justified by the facts or\r\nnot, when I do not know anything about them. But from my experience of\r\nwhat the state of things used to be, I should say that it is, in all\r\nprobability, fair.\r\n\r\nThe faults mentioned are exactly those which always have made their\r\nappearance, and I expect always will do so, and I do not see why the\r\nattention of the teachers should not as constantly be directed to them.\r\nYou talk of Eton. Well, the reports of the Examiners to the governing\r\nbody, year after year, had the same unpleasing monotony, and I do not\r\nbelieve that there is any educational body, from the Universities\r\ndownwards, which would come out much better, if the Examiners' reports\r\nwere published and if they did their duty.\r\n\r\nI am unable to see my way (and I suppose you are) to any better method\r\nof State encouragement of science teaching than payment by results. The\r\ngreat and manifest evil of that system, however, is the steady pressure\r\nwhich it exerts in the development of every description of sham\r\nteaching. And the only check upon this kind of swindling the public\r\nseems to me to lie in the hands of the Examiners. I told Mr. Forster\r\nso, ages ago, when he talked to me about the gradual increase of the\r\nexpenditure, and I have been confirmed in my opinion by all subsequent\r\nexperience. What the people who read the reports may say, I should not\r\ncare one twopenny d-- if I had to administer the thing.\r\n\r\nNine out of ten of them are incompetent to form any opinion on an\r\neducational subject; and as a mere matter of policy, I should, in\r\ndealing with them, be only too glad to be able to make it clear that\r\nsome of the defects and shortcomings inherent in this (as in all\r\nsystems) had been disguised, and that even the most fractious of\r\nExaminers had said their say without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of the system which seems to me to demand as a\r\ncorrective incessant and severe watchfulness on the part of the\r\nExaminers, and I see no harm if they a little overdo the thing in this\r\ndirection, for every sham they let through is an encouragement to other\r\nshams and pot-teaching in general.\r\n\r\nAnd if the \"great heart\" of the people and its thick head can't be got\r\nto appreciate honesty, why the sooner we shut up the better. Ireland\r\nmay be for the Irish, but science teaching is not for the sake of\r\nscience teachers.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.6.\r\n\r\n1889-90.\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of June to the middle of September, Huxley was in\r\nSwitzerland, first at Monte Generoso, then, when the weather became\r\nmore settled, at the Maloja. Here, as his letters show, he\r\n\"rejuvenated\" to such an extent that Sir Henry Thompson, who was at the\r\nMaloja, scoffed at the idea of his ever having had dilated heart.]\r\n\r\nMonte Generoso, Tessin, Suisse, June 25, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI am quite agreed with the proposed arrangements for the x, and hope I\r\nshall show better in the register of attendance next session.\r\n\r\nWhen I am striding about the hills here I really feel as if my\r\ninvalidism were a mere piece of malingering. When I am well I can walk\r\nup hill and down dale as well as I did twenty years ago. But my margin\r\nis abominably narrow, and I am at the mercy of \"liver and lights.\"\r\nSitting up for long and dining are questions of margin.\r\n\r\nI do not know if you have been here. We are close on 4000 feet up and\r\nlook straight over the great plain of North Italy on the one side and\r\nto a great hemicycle of mountains, Monte Rosa among them, on the other.\r\nI do not know anything more beautiful in its way. But the whole time we\r\nhave been here the weather has been extraordinary. On the average,\r\nabout two thunderstorms per diem. I am sure that a good meteorologist\r\nmight study the place with advantage. The barometer has not varied\r\nthree-twentieths of an inch the whole time, notwithstanding the storms.\r\n\r\nI hear the weather has been bad all over Switzerland, but it is not\r\nhigh and dry enough for me here, and we shall be off to the Maloja on\r\nSaturday next, and shall stay there till we return somewhere in\r\nSeptember. Collier and Ethel will join us there in August. He is none\r\nthe worse for his scarlatina.\r\n\r\n\"Aged Botanist?\" marry come up! [Sir J. Hooker jestingly congratulated\r\nhim on taking up botany in his old age.] I should like to know of a\r\nyounger spark. The first time I heard myself called \"the old gentleman\"\r\nwas years ago when we were in South Devon. A half-drunken Devonian had\r\nmade himself very offensive, in the compartment in which my wife and I\r\nwere travelling, and got some \"simple Saxon\" from me, accompanied, I\r\ndoubt not, by an awful scowl \"Ain't the old gentleman in a rage,\" says\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear of Reggie's success, and my wife joins with me\r\nin congratulations. It is a comfort to see one's shoots planted out and\r\ntaking root, though the idea that one's cares and anxieties about them\r\nare diminished, we find to be an illusion.\r\n\r\nI inclose cheque for my contributions due and to come. [For the x\r\nClub.] If I go to Davy's Locker before October, the latter may go for\r\nconsolation champagne!\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He writes from the Maloja on August 16 to Sir M. Foster, who had been\r\nsitting on the Vaccination Commission:--]\r\n\r\nI wonder how you are prospering, whether you have vaccination or\r\nanti-vaccination on the brain; or whether the gods have prospered you\r\nso far as to send you on a holiday. We have been here since the\r\nbeginning of July. Monte Generoso proved lovely--but electrical. We had\r\non the average three thunderstorms every two days. Bellagio was as hot\r\nas the tropics, and we stayed only a day, and came on here--where,\r\nwhatever else may happen, it is never too hot. The weather has been\r\ngood and I have profited immensely, and at present I do not know\r\nwhether I have a heart or not. But I have to look very sharp after my\r\nliver. H. Thompson, who has been here with his son Herbert (clever\r\nfellow, by the way), treats the notion that I ever had a dilated heart\r\nwith scorn! Oh these doctors! they are worse than theologians.\r\n\r\n[And again on August 31:--]\r\n\r\nI walked eighteen miles three or four days ago, and I think nothing of\r\none or two thousand feet up! I hope this state of things will last at\r\nthe sea-level.\r\n\r\nI am always glad to hear of and from you, but I have not been idle long\r\nenough to forget what being busy means, so don't let your conscience\r\nworry you about answering my letters.\r\n\r\n...X. is, I am afraid, more or less of an ass. The opposition he and\r\nhis friends have been making to the Technical Bill is quite\r\nunintelligible to me. Y. may be, and I rather think is, a knave, but he\r\nis no fool; and if I mistake not he is minded to kick the ultra-radical\r\nstool down now that he has mounted by it.

Pasteur for the prevention of hydrophobia.\r\n\r\n[I quote the latter from the report in \"Nature\" for July 4:--]\r\n\r\nMonte Generoso, Tessin, Suisse, June 25, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lankester,\r\n\r\nI enclose herewith a letter for the Lord Mayor and a cheque for 5\r\npounds as my subscription. I wish I could make the letter shorter, but\r\nit is pretty much \"pemmican\" already. However, it does not much matter\r\nbeing read if it only gets into print.\r\n\r\nIt is uncommonly good of the Lord Mayor to stand up for Science, in the\r\nteeth of the row the anti-vivisection pack--dogs and doggesses--are\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nMay his shadow never be less.\r\n\r\nWe shall be off to the Maloja at the end of this week, if the weather\r\nmends. Thunderstorms here every day, and sometimes two or three a day\r\nfor the last ten days.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nMonte Generoso, Switzerland, June 25, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy Lord Mayor,\r\n\r\nI greatly regret my inability to be present at the meeting which is to\r\nbe held, under your Lordship's auspices, in reference to M. Pasteur and\r\nhis Institute. The unremitting labours of that eminent Frenchman during\r\nthe last half-century have yielded rich harvests of new truths, and are\r\nmodels of exact and refined research. As such they deserve, and have\r\nreceived, all the honours which those who are the best judges of their\r\npurely scientific merits are able to bestow. But it so happens that\r\nthese subtle and patient searchings out of the ways of the infinitely\r\nlittle--of the swarming life where the creature that measures\r\none-thousandth part of an inch is a giant--have also yielded results of\r\nsupreme practical importance. The path of M. Pasteur's investigations\r\nis strewed with gifts of vast monetary value to the silk trades, the\r\nbrewer, and the wine merchant. And this being so, it might well be a\r\nproper and graceful act on the part of the representatives of trade and\r\ncommerce in its greatest centre to make some public recognition of M.\r\nPasteur's services, even if there were nothing further to be said about\r\nthem. But there is much more to be said. M. Pasteur's direct and\r\nindirect contributions to our knowledge of the causes of diseased\r\nstates, and of the means of preventing their recurrence, are not\r\nmeasurable by money values, but by those of healthy life and diminished\r\nsuffering to men. Medicine, surgery, and hygiene have all been\r\npowerfully affected by M. Pasteur's work, which has culminated in his\r\nmethod of treating hydrophobia. I cannot conceive that any competently\r\ninstructed person can consider M. Pasteur's labours in this direction\r\nwithout arriving at the conclusion that, if any man has earned the\r\npraise and honour of his fellows, he has. I find it no less difficult\r\nto imagine that our wealthy country should be other than ashamed to\r\ncontinue to allow its citizens to profit by the treatment freely given\r\nat the Institute without contributing to its support. Opposition to the\r\nproposals which your Lordship sanctions would be equally inconceivable\r\nif it arose out of nothing but the facts of the case thus presented.\r\nBut the opposition which, as I see from the English papers, is\r\nthreatened has really for the most part nothing to do either with M.\r\nPasteur's merits or with the efficacy of his method of treating\r\nhydrophobia. It proceeds partly from the fanatics of laissez faire, who\r\nthink it better to rot and die than to be kept whole and lively by\r\nState interference, partly from the blind opponents of properly\r\nconducted physiological experimentation, who prefer that men should\r\nsuffer than rabbits or dogs, and partly from those who for other but\r\nnot less powerful motives hate everything which contributes to prove\r\nthe value of strictly scientific methods of enquiry in all those\r\nquestions which affect the welfare of society. I sincerely trust that\r\nthe good sense of the meeting over which your Lordship will preside\r\nwill preserve it from being influenced by those unworthy antagonisms,\r\nand that the just and benevolent enterprise you have undertaken may\r\nhave a happy issue.\r\n\r\nI am, my Lord Mayor, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHotel Kursaal, Maloja, Haute Engadine, July 8, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lankester,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your letter. I was rather anxious as to the result of\r\nthe meeting, knowing the malice and subtlety of the Philistines, but as\r\nit turned out they were effectually snubbed. I was glad to see your\r\nallusion to Coleridge's impertinences. It will teach him to think twice\r\nbefore he abuses his position again. I do not understand Stead's\r\nposition in the Pall Mall. He snarls but does not bite.\r\n\r\nI am glad that the audience (I judge from the \"Times\" report) seemed to\r\ntake the points of my letter, and live in hope that when I see last\r\nweek's \"Spectator\" I shall find Hutton frantic.\r\n\r\nThis morning a letter marked \"Immediate\" reached me from Bourne, date\r\nJuly 3. I am afraid he does not read the papers or he would have known\r\nit was of no use to appeal to me in an emergency. I am writing to him.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[On his return to England, however, a fortnight of London, interrupted\r\nthough it was by a brief visit to Mr. and Mrs. Humphry Ward at the\r\ndelightful old house of Great Hampden, was as much as he could stand.\r\n\"I begin to discover,\" he writes to Sir M.

It does one good to\r\nhear of your being in such good working order. My knowledge of orchids\r\nis infinitesimally small, but there were some eight or nine species\r\nplentiful in the Engadine, and I learned enough to appreciate the\r\ndifficulties. Why do not some of these people who talk about the direct\r\ninfluence of conditions try to explain the structure of orchids on that\r\ntack? Orchids at any rate can't try to improve themselves in taking\r\nshots at insects' heads with pollen bags--as Lamarck's Giraffes tried\r\nto stretch their necks!\r\n\r\nBalfour's ballon d'essai [I.e. touching a proposed Roman Catholic\r\nUniversity for Ireland.] (I do not believe it could have been anything\r\nmore) is the only big blunder he has made, and it passes my\r\ncomprehension why he should have made it. But he seems to have dropped\r\nit again like the proverbial hot potato. If he had not, he would have\r\nhopelessly destroyed the Unionist party.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[At the end of the year he thanks Lord Tennyson for his gift of\r\n\"Demeter\":--]\r\n\r\nDecember 26, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tennyson,\r\n\r\nAccept my best thanks for your very kind present of \"Demeter.\" I have\r\nnot had a Christmas Box I valued so much for many a long year.

I kick up my heels now and then, and have a gallop round the\r\npaddock, but it does not come to much.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes to you, and, if Lady Tennyson has not forgotten me\r\naltogether, to her also.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A discussion in the \"Times\" this autumn, in which he joined, was of\r\nunexpected moment to him, inasmuch as it was the starting-point for no\r\nfewer than four essays in political philosophy, which appeared the\r\nfollowing year in the \"Nineteenth Century\".\r\n\r\nThe correspondence referred to arose out of the heckling of Mr. John\r\nMorley by one of his constituents at Newcastle in November 1889. The\r\nheckler questioned him concerning private property in land, quoting\r\nsome early dicta from the \"Social Statics\" of Mr. Herbert Spencer,\r\nwhich denied the justice of such ownership. Comments and explanations\r\nensued in the \"Times\"; Mr. Spencer declared that he had since partly\r\naltered that view, showing that contract has in part superseded force\r\nas the ground of ownership; and that in any case it referred to the\r\nidea of absolute ethics, and not to relative or practical politics.\r\n\r\nHuxley entered first into the correspondence to point out present and\r\nperilous applications of the absolute in contemporary politics.\r\nTouching on a State guarantee of the title to land, he asks if there is\r\nany moral right for confiscation:--In Ireland, he says, confiscation is\r\njustified by the appeal to wrongs inflicted a century ago; in England\r\nthe theorems of \"absolute political ethics\" are in danger of being\r\nemployed to make this generation of land-owners responsible for the\r\nmisdeeds of William the Conqueror and his followers. (\"Times\" November\r\n12.)\r\n\r\nHis remaining share in the discussion consisted of a brief passage of\r\narms with Mr. Spencer on the main question [November 18.], and a reply\r\nto another correspondent [November 21.], which brings forward an\r\nargument enlarged upon in one of the essays, namely that if the land\r\nbelongs to all men equally, why should one nation claim one portion\r\nrather than another? For several ownership is just as much an\r\ninfringement of the world's ownership as is personal ownership.\r\nMoreover, history shows that land was originally held in several\r\nownership, and that not of the nation, but of the village community.\r\n\r\nThese signs of renewed vigour induced Mr. Knowles to write him a\r\n\"begging letter,\" proposing an article for the \"Nineteenth Century\"\r\neither in commendation of Bishop Magee's recent utterances--it would be\r\nfine for eulogy to come from such a quarter after the recent\r\nencounter--or on the general subject of which his \"Times\" letters dealt\r\nwith a part.\r\n\r\nHuxley's choice was for the latter. Writing on November 21, he says:--]\r\n\r\nNow as to the article. I have only hesitated because I want to get out\r\na new volume of essays, and I am writing an introduction which gives me\r\nan immensity of trouble. I had made up my mind to get it done by\r\nChristmas, and if I write for you it won't be. However, if you don't\r\nmind leaving it open till the end of this month, I will see what can he\r\ndone in the way of a screed about, say, \"The Absolute in Practical\r\nLife.\" The Bishop would come in excellently; he deserves all praises,\r\nand my only hesitation about singing them is that the conjunction\r\nbetween the \"Infidel\" and the Churchman is just what the blatant\r\nplatform Dissenters who had been at him would like. I don't want to\r\nserve the Bishop, for whom I have a great liking and respect, as the\r\nbear served his sleeping master, when he smashed his nose in driving an\r\nunfortunate fly away!\r\n\r\nBy the way, has the Bishop published his speech or sermon? I have only\r\nseen a newspaper report.\r\n\r\n[Soon after this, he proposed to come to town and talk over the article\r\nwith Mr. Knowles. The latter sent him a telegram--reply paid--asking\r\nhim to fix a day. The answer named a day of the week and a day of the\r\nmonth which did not agree; whereupon Mr. Knowles wrote by the safer\r\nmedium of the post for an explanation, thinking that the post-office\r\nclerks must have bungled the message, and received the following\r\nreply:--]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, November 26, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nMay jackasses sit upon the graves of all telegraph clerks! But the boys\r\nare worse, and I shall have to write to the Postmaster-General about\r\nthe little wretch who brought your telegram the other day, when my mind\r\nwas deeply absorbed in the concoction of an article for THE Review of\r\nour age.\r\n\r\nThe creature read my answer, for he made me pay three halfpence extra\r\n(I believe he spent it on toffy), and yet was so stupid as not to see\r\nthat meaning to fix next Monday or Tuesday, I opened my diary to give\r\nthe dates in order that there should be no mistake, and found Monday 28\r\nand Tuesday 29.\r\n\r\nAnd I suppose the little beast would say he did not know I opened it in\r\nOctober instead of November!\r\n\r\nI hate such mean ways. Hang all telegraph boys!\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nMonday December 2, if you have nothing against it, and lunch if Mrs.\r\nKnowles will give me some.\r\n\r\n[The article was finished by the middle of December and duly sent to\r\nthe editor, under the title of \"Rousseau and Rousseauism.\" But fearing\r\nthat this title would surely attract attention among the working-men\r\nfor whom it was specially designed, Mr. Knowles suggested instead the\r\n\"Natural Inequality of Men,\" under which name it actually appeared in\r\nJanuary. So, too, in the case of a companion article in March, the\r\neditorial pen was responsible for the change from the arid\r\npossibilities of \"Capital and Labour\" to the more attractive title of\r\n\"Capital the Mother of Labour.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to this article and a further project of extending his\r\ndiscussion of the subject, he\r\nwrites:--]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, December 14, 1889.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI am very glad you think the article will go. It is longer than I\r\nintended, but I cannot accuse myself of having wasted words, and I have\r\nleft out several things that might have been said, but which can come\r\nin by and by.\r\n\r\nAs to title, do as you like, but that you propose does not seem to me\r\nquite to hit the mark. \"Political Humbug: Liberty and Equality,\" struck\r\nme as adequate, but my wife declares it is improper. \"Political\r\nFictions\" might be supposed to refer to Dizzie's novels! How about \"The\r\nPolitics of the Imagination: Liberty and Inequality\"?\r\n\r\nI should like to have some general title that would do for the\r\n\"letters\" which I see I shall have to write. I think I will make six of\r\nthem after the fashion of my \"Working Men's Lectures,\" as thus: (1)\r\nLiberty and Equality; (2) Rights of Man; (3) Property; (4) Malthus; (5)\r\nGovernment, the province of the State; (6) Law-making and Law-breaking.\r\n\r\nI understand you will let me republish them, as soon as the last is\r\nout, in a cheap form. I am not sure I will not put them in the form of\r\n\"Lectures\" rather than \"Letters.\"\r\n\r\nDid you ever read Henry George's book \"Progress and Poverty\"? It is\r\nmore damneder nonsense than poor Rousseau's blether. And to think of\r\nthe popularity of the book! But I ought to be grateful, as I can cut\r\nand come again at this wonderful dish.\r\n\r\nThe mischief of it is I do not see how I am to finish the introduction\r\nto my Essays, unless I put off sending you a second dose until March.\r\n\r\nI will send back the revise as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nEver yours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nYou do not tell me that there is anything to which Spencer can object,\r\nso I suppose there is nothing.\r\n\r\n[And in an undated letter to Sir J. Hooker, he says:--]\r\n\r\nI am glad you think well of the \"Human Inequality\" paper. My wife has\r\npersuaded me to follow it up with a view to making a sort of \"Primer of\r\nPolitics\" for the masses--by and by. \"There's no telling what you may\r\ncome to, my boy,\" said the Bishop who reproved his son for staring at\r\nJohn Kemble, and I may be a pamphleteer yet! But really it is time that\r\nsomebody should treat the people to common sense.\r\n\r\n[However, immediately after the appearance of this first article on\r\nHuman Inequality, he changed his mind about the Letters to Working Men,\r\nand resolved to continue what he had to say in the form of essays in\r\nthe \"Nineteenth Century\".\r\n\r\nHe then judged it not unprofitable to call public attention to the\r\nfallacies which first found their way into practical politics through\r\nthe disciples of Rousseau; one of those speculators of whom he remarks\r\n(\"Collected Essays\" 1 312) that] \"busied with deduction from their\r\nideal 'ought to be,' they overlooked the 'what has been,' the 'what\r\nis,' and the 'what can be.'\" \"Many a long year ago,\" [he says in\r\nNatural Rights and Political Rights (1 336)], \"I fondly imagined that\r\nHume and Kant and Hamilton having slain the 'Absolute,' the thing must,\r\nin decency, decease. Yet, at the present time, the same hypostatised\r\nnegation, sometimes thinly disguised under a new name, goes about in\r\nbroad daylight, in company with the dogmas of absolute ethics,\r\npolitical and other, and seems to be as lively as ever.\" This was to\r\nhis mind one of those instances of wrong thinking which lead to wrong\r\nacting--the postulating a general principle based upon insufficient\r\ndata, and the deduction from it of many and far-reaching practical\r\nconsequences. This he had always strongly opposed. His essay of 1871,\r\n\"Administrative Nihilism,\" was directed against a priori individualism;\r\nand now he proceeded to restate the arguments against a priori\r\npolitical reasoning in general, which seemed to have been forgotten or\r\noverlooked, especially by the advocates of compulsory socialism. And\r\nhere it is possible to show in some detail the care he took, as was his\r\nway, to refresh his knowledge and bring it up to date, before writing\r\non any special point. It is interesting to see how thoroughly he went\r\nto work, even in a subject with which he was already fairly acquainted.\r\nAs in the controversy of 1889 I find a list of near a score of books\r\nconsulted, so here one note-book contains an analysis of the origin and\r\nearly course of the French Revolution, especially in relation to the\r\nspeculations of the theorists; the declaration of the rights of man in\r\n1789 is followed by parallels from Mably's \"Droits et Devoirs du\r\nCitoyen\" and \"De la Legislation\", and by a full transcript of the 1793\r\nDeclaration, with notes on Robespierre's speech at the Convention a\r\nfortnight later. There are copious notes from Dunoyer, who is quoted in\r\nthe article, while the references to Rocquain's \"Esprit\r\nRevolutionnaire\" led to an English translation of the work being\r\nundertaken, to which he contributed a short preface in 1891.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with other studies. He loved to visualise his object\r\nclearly. The framework of what he wished to say would always be drawn\r\nout first. In any historical matter he always worked with a map. In\r\nnatural history he well knew the importance of studying distribution\r\nand its bearing upon other problems; in civil history he would draw\r\nmaps to illustrate either the conditions of a period or the spread of a\r\ncivilising nation. For instance, among sketches of the sort which\r\nremain, I have one of the Hellenic world, marked off in 25-mile circles\r\nfrom Delos as centre; and a similar one for the Phoenician world,\r\nstarting from Tyre. Sketch maps of Palestine and Mesopotamia, with\r\nnotes from the best authorities on the geography of the two countries,\r\nbelong in all probability to the articles on \"The Flood\" and\r\n\"Hasisadra's Adventure.\" To realise clearly the size, position, and\r\nrelation of the parts to the whole, was the mechanical instinct of the\r\nengineer which was so strong in him.\r\n\r\nThe four articles which followed in quick succession on \"The Natural\r\nInequality of Man,\" \"Natural and Political Rights,\" \"Capital the Mother\r\nof Labour,\" and \"Government,\" appeared in the January, February, March,\r\nand May numbers of the \"Nineteenth Century\", and, as was said above,\r\nare directed against a priori reasoning in social philosophy. The\r\nfirst, which appeared simultaneously with Mr. Herbert Spencer's article\r\non \"Justice,\" in the \"Nineteenth Century\", assails, on the ground of\r\nfact and history, the dictum that men are born free and equal, and have\r\na natural right to freedom and equality, so that property and political\r\nrights are a matter of contract. History denies that they thus\r\noriginated; and, in fact, \"proclaim human equality as loudly as you\r\nlike, Witless will serve his brother.\" Yet, in justice to Rousseau and\r\nthe influence he wielded, he adds:--]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be forgotten that what we call rational grounds for our\r\nbeliefs are often extremely irrational attempts to justify our\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nThus if, in their plain and obvious sense, the doctrines which Rousseau\r\nadvanced are so easily upset, it is probable that he had in his mind\r\nsomething which is different from that sense.\r\n\r\n[When they sought speculative grounds to justify the empirical truth:--]\r\n\r\nthat it is desirable in the interests of society, that all men should\r\nbe as free as possible, consistently with those interests, and that\r\nthey should all be equally bound by the ethical and legal obligations\r\nwhich are essential to social existence, \"the philosophers,\" as is the\r\nfashion of speculators, scorned to remain on the safe if humble ground\r\nof experience, and preferred to prophesy from the sublime cloudland of\r\nthe a priori.\r\n\r\n[The second of these articles is an examination of Henry George's\r\ndoctrines as set forth in \"Progress and Poverty\". His relation to the\r\nphysiocrats is shown in a preliminary analysis of the term \"natural\r\nrights which have no wrongs,\" and are antecedent to morality, from\r\nwhich analysis are drawn the results of confounding natural with moral\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nHere again is the note of justice to an argument in an unsound shape\r\n(page 369): \"There is no greater mistake than the hasty conclusion that\r\nopinions are worthless because they are badly argued.\" And a trifling\r\nabatement of the universal and exclusive form of Henry George's\r\nprinciple may make it true, while even unamended it may lead to\r\nopposite conclusions--to the justification of several ownership in land\r\nas well as in any other form of property.\r\n\r\nThe third essay of the series, \"Capital the Mother of Labour\"\r\n(\"Collected Essays\" 9 147), was an application of biological methods to\r\nsocial problems, designed to show that the extreme claims of labour as\r\nagainst capital are ill-founded.\r\n\r\nIn the last article, \"Government,\" he traces the two extreme\r\ndevelopments of absolute ethics, as shown in anarchy and regimentation,\r\nor unrestrained individualism and compulsory socialism. The key to the\r\nposition, of course, lies in the examination of the premisses upon\r\nwhich these superstructures are raised, and history shows that:--]\r\n\r\nSo far from the preservation of liberty and property and the securing\r\nof equal rights being the chief and most conspicuous object aimed at by\r\nthe archaic politics of which we know anything, it would be a good deal\r\nnearer the truth to say that they were federated absolute monarchies,\r\nthe chief purpose of which was the maintenance of an established church\r\nfor the worship of the family ancestors.\r\n\r\n[These articles stirred up critics of every sort and kind; socialists\r\nwho denounced him as an individualist, land nationalisers who had not\r\nrealised the difference between communal and national ownership, or men\r\nwho denounced him as an arm-chair cynic, careless of the poor and\r\nignorant of the meaning of labour. Mr. Spencer considered the chief\r\nattack to be directed against his position; the regimental socialists\r\nas against theirs, and:--]\r\n\r\nas an attempt to justify those who, content with the present, are\r\nopposed to all endeavours to bring about any fundamental change in our\r\nsocial arrangements (ib. page 423).\r\n\r\nSo far from this, he continues:--]\r\n\r\nThose who have had the patience to follow me to the end will, I trust,\r\nhave become aware that my aim has been altogether different. Even the\r\nbest of modern civilisations appears to me to exhibit a condition of\r\nmankind which neither embodies any worthy ideal nor even possesses the\r\nmerit of stability. I do not hesitate to express my opinion that, if\r\nthere is no hope of a large improvement of the condition of the greater\r\npart of the human family; if it is true that the increase of knowledge,\r\nthe winning of a greater dominion over Nature which is its consequence,\r\nand the wealth which follows upon that dominion, are to make no\r\ndifference in the extent and the intensity of Want, with its\r\nconcomitant physical and moral degradation, among the masses of the\r\npeople, I should hail the advent of some kindly comet, which would\r\nsweep the whole affair away, as a desirable consummation. What profits\r\nit to the human Prometheus that he has stolen the fire of heaven to be\r\nhis servant, and that the spirits of the earth and of the air obey him,\r\nif the vulture of pauperism is eternally to tear his very vitals and\r\nkeep him on the brink of destruction?\r\n\r\nAssuredly, if I believed that any of the schemes hitherto proposed for\r\nbringing about social amelioration were likely to attain their end, I\r\nshould think what remains to me of life well spent in furthering it.\r\nBut my interest in these questions did not begin the day before\r\nyesterday; and, whether right or wrong, it is no hasty conclusion of\r\nmine that we have small chance of doing rightly in this matter (or\r\nindeed in any other) unless we think rightly. Further, that we shall\r\nnever think rightly in politics until we have cleared our minds of\r\ndelusions, and more especially of the philosophical delusions which, as\r\nI have endeavoured to show, have infested political thought for\r\ncenturies. My main purpose has been to contribute my mite towards this\r\nessential preliminary operation. Ground must be cleared and levelled\r\nbefore a building can be properly commenced; the labour of the navvy is\r\nas necessary as that of the architect, however much less honoured; and\r\nit has been my humble endeavour to grub up those old stumps of the a\r\npriori which stand in the way of the very foundations of a sane\r\npolitical philosophy.\r\n\r\nTo those who think that questions of the kind I have been discussing\r\nhave merely an academic interest, let me suggest once more that a\r\ncentury ago Robespierre and St. Just proved that the way of answering\r\nthem may have extremely practical consequences.\r\n\r\n[Without pretending to offer any offhand solution for so vast a\r\nproblem, he suggests two points in conclusion. One, that in considering\r\nthe matter we should proceed from the known to the unknown, and take\r\nwarning from the results of either extreme in self-government or the\r\ngovernment of a family; the other, that the central point is] \"the fact\r\nthat the natural order of things--the order, that is to say, as\r\nunmodified by human effort--does not tend to bring about what we\r\nunderstand as welfare.\" [The population question has first to be faced.\r\n\r\nThe following letters cover the period up to the trip to the Canaries,\r\nalready alluded to:--]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, January 6, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nThat capital photograph reached me just as we were going up to town\r\n(invited for the holidays by our parents), and I put it in my bag to\r\nremind me to write to you. Need I say that I brought it back again\r\nwithout having had the grace to send a line of thanks? By way of making\r\nmy peace, I have told the Fine Art Society to send you a copy of the\r\nengraving of my sweet self. I have not had it framed--firstly, because\r\nit is a hideous nuisance to be obliged to hang a frame one may not\r\nlike; and secondly, because by possibility you might like some other\r\nportrait better, in which case, if you will tell me, I will send that\r\nother. I should like you to have something by way of reminder of T.H.H.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry [His younger son.] has done his work at Bart's at the end of\r\nMarch I am going to give him a run before he settles down to practice.\r\nProbably we shall go to the Canaries. I hear that the man who knows\r\nmost about them is Dr. Guillemard, a Cambridge man. \"Kennst ihn du\r\nwohl?\" Perhaps he might give me a wrinkle.\r\n\r\nWith our united best wishes to you all.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nEastbourne, January 13, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWe missed you on the 2nd, though you were quite right not to come in\r\nthat beastly weather.\r\n\r\nMy boy Harry has had a very sharp attack of influenza at Bartholomew's,\r\nand came down to us to convalesce a week ago, very much pulled down. I\r\nhope you will keep clear of it.\r\n\r\nHarry's work at the hospital is over at the end of March, and before\r\nthe influenza business I was going to give him a run for a month or six\r\nweeks before he settled down to practice. We shall go to the Canaries\r\nas soon in April as possible. Are you minded to take a look at\r\nTeneriffe? Only 4 1/2 days' sea--good ships.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[However, Sir J. Hooker was unable to join \"the excursion to the Isles\r\nof the Blest.\"]\r\n\r\nEastbourne, January 27, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nPeople have been at me to publish my notice of Darwin in the\r\n\"Proceedings of the Royal Society\" in a separate form.\r\n\r\nIf you have no objection, will you apply to the Council for me for the\r\nrequisite permission?\r\n\r\nBut if you DO see any objection, I would rather not make the request.\r\n\r\nI think if I republish it I will add the \"Times\" article of 1859 to it.\r\nOmega and Alpha!\r\n\r\nHope you are flourishing. We shall be up for a few days next week.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nEastbourne, January 31, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nMind you let me know what points you think want expanding in the Darwin\r\nobituary when we meet.\r\n\r\nWe go to town on Tuesday for a few days, and I will meet you anywhere\r\nor anywhen you like. Could you come and dine with us at 4 P.M. on\r\nThursday? If so, please let me know at once, that E. may kill the\r\nfatted calf.\r\n\r\nHarry has been and gone and done it. We heard he had gone to Yorkshire,\r\nand were anxious, thinking that at the very least a relapse after his\r\ninfluenza (which he had sharply) had occurred.\r\n\r\nBut the complaint was one with more serious sequelae still. Don't know\r\nthe young lady, but the youth has a wise head on his shoulders, and\r\nthough that did not prevent Solomon from overdoing the business, I have\r\nevery faith in his choice.\r\n\r\nDr. Guillemard has kindly sent me a lot of valuable information; but as\r\nI suggested to my boy yesterday, he may find Yorkshire air more\r\nwholesome than that of the Canaries, and it is ten to one we don't go\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[To his younger son:--]\r\n\r\nEastbourne, January 30, 1890.\r\n\r\nYou dear old humbug of a Boy,\r\n\r\nHere we have been mourning over the relapse of influenza, which alone,\r\nas we said, could have torn you from your duties, and all the while it\r\nwas nothing but an attack of palpitation such as young people are\r\nliable to and seem none the worse for after all. We are as happy that\r\nyou are happy as you can be yourself, though from your letter that\r\nseems saying a great deal. I am prepared to be the young lady's slave;\r\npray tell her that I am a model father-in-law, with my love. (By the\r\nway, you might mention her name; it is a miserable detail, I know, but\r\nwould be interesting.) Please add that she is humbly solicited to grant\r\nleave of absence for the Teneriffe trip, unless she thinks Northampton\r\nair more invigorating.\r\n\r\nEver your loving dad,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nOn April 3, accompanied by his son, he left London on board the\r\n\"Aorangi\". At Plymouth he had time to meet his friend W.F. Collier, and\r\nto visit the Zoological Station, while], \"to my great satisfaction,\"\r\n[he writes], \"I received a revise (i.e. of 'Capital the Mother of\r\nLabour') for the May 'Nineteenth Century'--from Knowles. They must have\r\nlooked sharp at the printing-office.\"\r\n\r\n[It did not take him long to recover his sea-legs, and he thoroughly\r\nenjoyed even the rougher days when the rolling of the ship was too much\r\nfor other people. The day before reaching Teneriffe he writes:--]\r\n\r\nI have not felt so well for a long time. I do nothing, have a\r\nprodigious appetite, and Harry declares I am getting fat in the face.\r\n\r\n[Santa Cruz was reached early on April 10, and in the afternoon he\r\nproceeded to Laguna, which he made his headquarters for a week. That\r\nday he walked 10 miles, the next 15, and the third 20 in the course of\r\nthe day. He notes finding the characteristic Euphorbia and Heaths of\r\nthe Canaries; notes, too, one or two visitations of dyspepsia from\r\nindigestible food. He writes from Laguna:--]\r\n\r\nFrom all that people with whom we meet tell me, I gather that the usual\r\nmassive lies about health resorts pervade the accounts of Teneriffe.\r\nSanta Cruz would reduce me to jelly in a week, and I hear that Orotava\r\nis worse--stifling. Guimar, whither we go to-morrow, is warranted to be\r\ndry and everlasting sunshine. We shall see. One of the people staying\r\nin the house said they had rain there for a fortnight together...I am\r\nall right now, and walked some 15 miles up hill and down dale to-day,\r\nand I am not more than comfortably tired. However, I am not going to\r\ntry the peak. I find it cannot be done without a night out at a\r\nconsiderable height when the thermometer commonly goes down below\r\nfreezing, and I am not going to run that risk for the chance of seeing\r\neven the famous shadows.\r\n\r\n[By some mischance, no letters from home reached him till the 26th, and\r\nhe writes from Guimar on the 23rd:--]\r\n\r\nA lady who lives here told me yesterday that a postmistress at one\r\nplace was in the habit of taking off the stamps and turning the letters\r\non one side! But that luckily is not a particular dodge with ours.\r\n\r\nWe drove over here on the 17th. It is a very picturesque place 1000\r\nfeet up in the midst of a great amphitheatre of high hills, facing\r\nnorth, orange-trees laden with fruit, date palms and bananas are in the\r\ngarden, and there is lovely sunshine all day long. Altogether the\r\nclimate is far the best I have found anywhere here, and the house,\r\nwhich is that of a Spanish Marquesa, only opened as a hotel this\r\nwinter, is very comfortable. I am sitting with the window wide open at\r\nnine o'clock at night, and the stars flash as if the sky were\r\nAustralian.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday we had a splendid excursion up to the top of the pass that\r\nleads from here up to the other side of the island. Road in the proper\r\nsense there was none, and the track incredibly bad, worse than any\r\nAlpine path owing to the loose irregular stones. The mules, however,\r\npick their way like cats, and you have only to hold on. The pass is\r\n6000 feet high, and we ascended still higher. Fortune favoured us. It\r\nwas a lovely day and the clouds lay in a great sheet a thousand feet\r\nbelow. The peak, clear in the blue sky, rose up bare and majestic 5000\r\nfeet out of as desolate a desert clothed with the stiff retama shrubs\r\n(a sort of broom) as you can well imagine. [(The Canadas, which he\r\ncalls] \"the one thing worth seeing there.\") It took us three hours and\r\na half to get up, passing for a good deal of the time through a kind of\r\nlow brush of white and red cistuses in full bloom. We saw Palma on one\r\nside, and Grand Canary on the other, beyond the layer of clouds which\r\nenveloped all the lower part of the island. Coming down was worse than\r\ngoing up, and we walked a good part of the way, getting back about six.\r\nAbout seven hours in the saddle and walking.\r\n\r\nYou never saw anything like the improvement in Harry. He is burnt deep\r\nred; he says my nose is of the same hue, and at the end of the journey\r\nhe raced Gurilio, our guide, who understands no word of English any\r\nmore than we do Spanish, but we are quite intimate nevertheless. [My\r\nbrother indeed averred that his language of signs was far more\r\neffectual than the Spanish which my father persisted in trying upon the\r\ninhabitants. This guide, by the way, was very sceptical as to any\r\nEnglishman being equal to walking the seventeen miles, much less\r\nbeating him in a race over the stony track. His experience was entirely\r\nlimited to invalids.]\r\n\r\nHe reiterates his distress at not getting letters from his wife:\r\n\"Certainly I will never run the risk of being so long without--never\r\nagain.\" When, after all, the delayed letters reached him on his way\r\nback from the expedition to the Canadas, thanks to a traveller who\r\nbrought them up from Laguna, he writes (April 24):--]\r\n\r\nCatch me going out of reach of letters again. I have been horridly\r\nanxious. Nobody--children or any one else--can be to me what you are.\r\nUlysses preferred his old woman to immortality, and this absence has\r\nled me to see that he was as wise in that as in other things.\r\n\r\n[Here is a novel description of an hotel at Puerto Orotava:--]\r\n\r\nIt is very pretty to look at, but all draughts. I compare it to the air\r\nof a big wash-house with all the doors open, and it was agreed that the\r\nlikeness was exact.\r\n\r\n[On May 2 he sailed for Madeira by the \"German\", feeling already \"ten\r\nyears younger\" for his holiday. On the 3rd he writes:--]\r\n\r\nThe last time I was in this place was in 1846. All my life lies between\r\nthe two visits. I was then twenty-one and a half and I shall be\r\nsixty-five to-morrow. The place looks to me to have grown a good deal,\r\nbut I believe it is chiefly English residents whose villas dot the\r\nhill. There were no roads forty-four years ago. Now there is one, I am\r\ntold, to Camera do Lobos nearly five miles long. That is the measure of\r\nPortuguese progress in half a century. Moreover, the men have left off\r\nwearing their pigtail caps and the women their hoods.\r\n\r\n[To his youngest daughter:--]\r\n\r\nBella Vista Hotel, Funchal, May 6, 1890.\r\n\r\nDearest Babs,\r\n\r\nThis comes wishing you many happy returns of the day, though a little\r\nlate in the arrival. Harry sends his love, and desires me to say that\r\nhe took care to write a letter which should arrive in time, but\r\nunfortunately forgot to mention the birthday in it! So I think, on the\r\nwhole, I have the pull of him. We ought to be back about the 18th or\r\n19th, as I have put my name down for places in the \"Conway Castle\",\r\nwhich is to call here on the 12th, and I do not suppose she will be\r\nfull. In the meanwhile, we shall fill up the time by a trip to the\r\nother side of the island, on which we start to-morrow morning at 7.30.\r\nYou have to take your own provisions and rugs to sleep upon and under,\r\nas the fleas la bas are said to be unusually fine and active. We start\r\nquite a procession with a couple of horses, a guide, and two men\r\n(owners of the nags) to carry the baggage; and I suspect that before\r\nto-morrow night we shall have made acquaintance with some remarkably\r\nbad apologies for roads. But the horses here seem to prefer going up\r\nbad staircases at speed (with a man hanging on by the tail to steer),\r\nand if you only stick to them they land you all right. I have developed\r\nso much prowess in this line that I think of coming out in the\r\ncharacter of Buffalo Bill on my return. Hands and face of both of us\r\nare done to a good burnt sienna, and a few hours more or less in the\r\nsaddle don't count. I do not think either of us have been so well for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard of our doings in Teneriffe from M--. The Canadas\r\nthere is the one thing worth seeing, altogether unique. As a health\r\nresort I should say the place is a fraud--always excepting Guimar--and\r\nthat, excellent for people in good health, is wholly unfit for a real\r\ninvalid, who must either go uphill or downhill over the worst of roads\r\nif he leaves the hotel.\r\n\r\nThe air here is like that of South Devon at its best--very soft, but\r\nnot stifling as at Orotava. We had a capital expedition yesterday to\r\nthe Grand Corral--the ancient volcanic crater in the middle of the\r\nisland with walls some 3000 feet high, all scarred and furrowed by\r\nravines, and overgrown with rich vegetation. There is a little village\r\nat the bottom of it which I should esteem as a retreat if I wished to\r\nbe out of sight and hearing of the pomps and vanities of this world. By\r\nthe way, I have been pretty well out of hearing of everything as it is,\r\nfor I only had three letters from M-- while we were in Teneriffe, and\r\nnot one here up to this date. After I had made all my arrangements to\r\nstart to-morrow I heard that a mail would be in at noon. So the letters\r\nwill have to follow us in the afternoon by one of the men, who will\r\nwait for them.\r\n\r\nWe went to-day to lunch with Mr. Blandy, the head of the principal\r\nshipping agency here, whose wife is the daughter of my successor at the\r\nFishery Office.\r\n\r\nWell, our trip has done us both a world of good; but I am getting\r\nhomesick, and shall rejoice to be back again. I hope that Joyce is\r\nflourishing, and Jack satisfied with the hanging of his pictures, and\r\nthat a millionaire has insisted on buying the picture and adding a\r\nbonus. Our\r\nbest love to you all.\r\n\r\nEver your loving Pater.\r\n\r\nDon't know M--'s whereabouts. But if she is with you, say I wrote her a\r\nlong screed (Number 8) and posted it to-day--with my love as a model\r\nhusband and complete letter-writer.\r\n\r\n[On returning home he found that the Linnean medal had been awarded\r\nhim.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, May 18, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nHow's a' wi' you? My boy and I came back from Madeira yesterday in\r\ngreat feather. As for myself, riding about on mules, or horses, for six\r\nto ten hours at a stretch--burning in sun or soaking in rain--over the\r\nmost entirely breakneck roads and tracks I have ever made acquaintance\r\nwith, except perhaps in Morocco--has proved a most excellent tonic,\r\ncathartic, and alterative all in one. Existence of heart and stomach\r\nare matters of faith, not of knowledge, with me at present. I hope it\r\nmay last, and I have had such a sickener of invalidism that my\r\nintention is to keep severely out of all imprudences.\r\n\r\nBut what is a man to do if his friends take advantage of his absence,\r\nand go giving him gold medals behind his back? That you have been an\r\naccomplice in this nefarious plot--mine own familiar friend whom I\r\ntrusted and trust--is not to be denied. Well, it is very pleasant to\r\nhave toil that is now all ancient history remembered, and I shall go to\r\nthe meeting and the dinner and make my speech in spite of as many\r\npossible devils of dyspepsia as there are plates and dishes on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nWe were lucky in getting in for nothing worse than heavy rolling,\r\neither out or in. Teneriffe is well worth seeing. The Canadas is\r\nsomething quite by itself, a bit of Egypt 6000 feet up with a bare\r\nvolcanic cone, or rather long barrow sticking up 6000 feet in the\r\nmiddle of it.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, Madeira is vastly superior. I rode across from Funchal to\r\nSao Vicente, up to Paul da Serra, then along the coast to Santa Anna,\r\nand back from Santa Anna to Funchal. I have seen nothing comparable\r\nexcept in Mauritius, nor anything anywhere like the road by the cliffs\r\nfrom Sao Vicente to Santa Anna. Lucky for me that my ancient nautical\r\nhabit of sticking on to a horse came back. A good deal of the road is\r\nlike a bad staircase, with no particular banisters, and a well of 1000\r\nfeet with the sea at the bottom. Your heart would rejoice over the\r\ngreat heaths. I saw one, the bole of which split into nearly equal\r\ntrunks; and one of these was just a metre in circumference, and had a\r\nhead as big as a moderate-sized ash. Gorse in full flower, up to 12 or\r\n15 feet high. On the whole a singular absence of flowering herbs except\r\nCinerarias and, especially in Teneriffe, Echium. I did not chance to\r\nsee a Euphorbia in Madeira, though I believe there are some. In\r\nTeneriffe they are everywhere in queer shapes, and there was a thing\r\nthat mimicked the commonest Euphorbia but had no milk, which I will ask\r\nyou about when I see you. The Euphorbias were all in flower, but this\r\nthing had none. But you will have had enough of my scrawl.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.7.\r\n\r\n1890-1891.\r\n\r\n[Three letters of the first half of the year may conveniently be placed\r\nhere. The first is to Tyndall, who had just been delivering an\r\nanti-Gladstonian speech at Belfast. The opening reference must be to\r\nsome newspaper paragraph which I have not been able to trace, just as\r\nthe second is to a paragraph in 1876, not long after Tyndall's\r\nmarriage, which described Huxley as starting for America with his\r\ntitled bride.]\r\n\r\n3 Jevington Gardens, Eastbourne, February 24, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nPut down the three half-pints and the two dozen to the partnership\r\naccount. Ever since the \"titled bride\" business I have given up the\r\nstruggle against the popular belief that you and I constitute a firm.\r\n\r\nIt's very hard on me in the decline of life to have a lively young\r\npartner who thinks nothing of rushing six or seven hundred miles to\r\nperform a war-dance on the sainted G.O.M., and takes the scalp of\r\nHistoricus as an hors d'oeuvre.\r\n\r\nAll of which doubtless goes down to my account just as my poor innocent\r\narticles confer a reputation for long-suffering mildness on you.\r\n\r\nWell! well! there is no justice in this world! With our best love to\r\nyou both.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[(The confusion in the popular mind continued steadily, so that at\r\nlast, when Tyndall died, Huxley received the doubtful honour of a\r\nfuneral sermon.)\r\n\r\nDr. Pelseneer, to whom the next letter is addressed, is a Belgian\r\nmorphologist, and an authority upon the Mollusca. He it was who\r\nafterwards completed Huxley's unfinished memoir on Spirula for the\r\n\"Challenger\" report.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, June 10, 1890.\r\n\r\nDear Dr. Pelseneer,\r\n\r\nI gave directions yesterday for the packing up and sending to your\r\naddress of the specimens of Trigonia, and I trust that they will reach\r\nyou safely.\r\n\r\nI am rejoiced that you are about to take up the subject. I was but a\r\nbeginner when I worked at Trigonia, and I had always promised myself\r\nthat I would try to make good the many deficiencies of my little\r\nsketch. But three or four years ago my health gave way completely, and\r\nthough I have recovered (no less to my own astonishment than to that of\r\nthe doctors) I am compelled to live out of London and to abstain from\r\nall work which involves much labour.\r\n\r\nThus science has got so far ahead of me that I hesitate to say much\r\nabout a difficult morphological question--all the more, as old men like\r\nmyself should be on their guard against over-much tenderness for their\r\nown speculations. And I am conscious of a great tenderness for those\r\ncontained in my ancient memoir on the \"Morphology of the Cephalous\r\nMollusca.\" Certainly I am entirely disposed to agree with you that the\r\nGasteropods and the Lamellibranchs spring from a common root--nearly\r\nrepresented by the Chiton--especially by a hypothetical Chiton with one\r\nshell plate.\r\n\r\nI always thought Nucula the key to the Lamellibranchs, and I am very\r\nglad you have come to that conclusion on such much better evidence.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Dr. Pelseneer, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Towards the end of June he went for a week to Salisbury, taking long\r\nwalks in the neighbourhood, and exploring the town and cathedral, which\r\nhe confessed himself ashamed never to have seen before.\r\n\r\nHe characteristically fixes its date in his memory by noting that the\r\nmain part of it was completed when Dante was a year old.]\r\n\r\nThe White Hart, Salisbury, June 22, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nCouldn't stand any more London, so bolted here yesterday morning, and\r\nhere I shall probably stop for the next few days.\r\n\r\nI have been trying any time the last thirty years to see Stonehenge,\r\nand this time I mean to do it. I should have gone to-day, but the\r\nweather was not promising, so I spent my Sunday morning in Old\r\nSarum--that blessed old tumulus with nine (or was it eleven?) burgesses\r\nthat used to send two members to Parliament when I was a child. Really\r\nyou Radicals are of some use after all!\r\n\r\nPoor old Smyth's death is just what I expected, though I did not think\r\nthe catastrophe was so imminent. [Warrington Wilkinson Smyth\r\n(1817-1890), the geologist and mineralogist. In 1851 he was appointed\r\nLecturer on Mining and Mineralogy at the Royal School of Mines.

He was knighted in 1887.]\r\n\r\nPeace be with him; he never did justice to his very considerable\r\nabilities, but he was a good fellow and a fine old crusted Conservative.\r\n\r\nI suppose it will be necessary to declare the vacancy and put somebody\r\nin his place before long.\r\n\r\nI learned before I started that Smyth was to be buried in Cornwall, so\r\nthere is no question of attending at his funeral.\r\n\r\nI am the last of the original Jermyn Street gang left in the school\r\nnow--Ultimus Romanorum!\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This trip was taken by way of a holiday after the writing of an\r\narticle, which appeared in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for July 1890. It\r\nwas called \"The Lights of the Church and the Light of Science,\" and may\r\nbe considered as written in fulfilment of the plan spoken of in the\r\nletter to Mr. Clodd (above). Its subject was the necessary dependence\r\nof Christian theology upon the historical accuracy of the Old\r\nTestament; its occasion, the publication of a sermon in which, as a\r\ncounterblast to \"Lux Mundi\", Canon Liddon declared that accuracy to be\r\nsanctioned by the use made of the Old Testament by Jesus Christ, and\r\nbade his hearers close their ears against any suggestions impairing the\r\ncredit of those Jewish Scriptures which have received the stamp of His\r\nDivine authority.\r\n\r\nPointing out that, as in other branches of history, so here the\r\nhistorical accuracy of early tradition was abandoned even by\r\nconservative critics, who at all understood the nature of the problems\r\ninvolved, Huxley proceeded to examine the story of the Flood, and to\r\nshow that the difficulties were little less in treating it--like the\r\nreconcilers--as a partial than as a universal deluge. Then he discussed\r\nthe origin of the story, and criticised the attempt of the essayist in\r\n\"Lux Mundi\" to treat this and similar stories as \"types,\" which must be\r\nvalueless if typical of no underlying reality. These things are of\r\nmoment in speculative thought, for if Adam be not an historical\r\ncharacter, if the story of the Fall be but a type, the basis of Pauline\r\ntheology is shaken; they are of moment practically, for it is the story\r\nof the Creation which is referred to in the] \"speech (Matt. 19 5)\r\nunhappily famous for the legal oppression to which it has been\r\nwrongfully forced to lend itself\" [in the marriage laws.\r\n\r\nIn July 1890, Sir J.G.T. Sinclair wrote to him, calling his attention\r\nto a statement of Babbage's that after a certain point his famous\r\ncalculating machine, contrary to all expectation, suddenly introduced a\r\nnew principle of numeration into a series of numbers (Extract from\r\nBabbage's Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. Babbage shows that a calculating\r\nmachine can be constructed which, after working in a correct and\r\norderly manner up to 100,000,000, then leaps, and instead of continuing\r\nthe chain of numbers unbroken, goes at once to 100,010,002. \"The law\r\nwhich seemed at first to govern the series failed at the hundred\r\nmillion and second term. This term is larger than we expected by\r\n10,000. The law thus changes:--\r\n\r\n100,000,001\r\n100,010,002\r\n100,030,003\r\n100,060,004\r\n100,100,005\r\n100,150,006\r\n100,210,007\r\n100,280,008.\r\n\r\nFor a hundred or even a thousand terms they continued to follow the new\r\nlaw relating to the triangular numbers, but after watching them for\r\n2761 terms we find that this law fails at the 2762nd term.\r\n\r\nIf we continue to observe we shall discover another law then coming\r\ninto action which also is different, dependent, but in a different\r\nmanner, on triangular numbers because a number of points agreeing with\r\ntheir term may be placed in the form of a triangle, thus:--\r\n\r\n(1 dot.) (3 dots in the form of a triangle.) (6 dots in the form of a\r\ntriangle.) (10 dots in the form of a triangle.) (one, three, six, ten).\r\n\r\nThis will continue through about 1430 terms, when a new law is again\r\nintroduced over about 950 terms, and this too, like its predecessors,\r\nfails and gives place to other laws which appear at different\r\nintervals.\"), and asking what effect this phenomenon had upon the\r\ntheory of Induction. Huxley replied as follows:--]\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, July 21, 1890.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI knew Mr. Babbage, and am quite sure that he was not the man to say\r\nanything on the topic of calculating machines which he could not\r\njustify.\r\n\r\nI do not see that what he says affects the philosophy of induction as\r\nrightly understood. No induction, however broad its basis, can confer\r\ncertainty--in the strict sense of the word. The experience of the whole\r\nhuman race through innumerable years has shown that stones unsupported\r\nfall to the ground, but that does not make it certain that any day next\r\nweek unsupported stones will not move the other way. All that it does\r\njustify is the very strong expectation, which hitherto has been\r\ninvariably verified, that they will do just the contrary.\r\n\r\nOnly one absolute certainty is possible to man--namely, that at any\r\ngiven moment the feeling which he has exists.\r\n\r\nAll other so-called certainties are beliefs of greater or less\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose that I am following Abernethy's famous prescription,\r\n\"take my pills,\" if I refer you to an essay of mine on \"Descartes,\" and\r\na little book on Hume, for the fuller discussion of these points.\r\nHume's argument against miracles turns altogether on the fallacy that\r\ninduction can give certainty in the strict sense.\r\n\r\nWe poor mortals have to be content with hope and belief in all matters\r\npast and present--our sole certainty is momentary.\r\n\r\nI am yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nSir J.G.T. Sinclair, Bart.\r\n\r\n[Except for a last visit to London to pack his books, which proved a\r\nheavier undertaking than he had reckoned upon, Huxley did not leave\r\nEastbourne this autumn, refusing Sir J. Donnelly's hospitable\r\ninvitation to stay with him in Surrey during the move, of which he\r\nexclaims:--]\r\n\r\nThank Heaven that is my last move--except to a still smaller residence\r\nof a subterranean character!\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, September 19, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nAnd my books--and watch-dog business generally?\r\n\r\nHow is that to be transacted whether as in-patient or out-patient at\r\nFirdale? Much hospitality hath made thee mad.\r\n\r\nSeriously, it's not to be done nohow. What between papers that don't\r\ncome, and profligate bracket manufacturers who keep you waiting for\r\nmonths and then send the wrong things--and a general tendency of\r\neverybody to do nothing right or something wrong--it is as much as the\r\ntwo of us will do--to get in, and all in the course of the next three\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nOf course my wife has no business to go to London to superintend the\r\npacking--but I should like to see anybody stop her. However, she has\r\ngot the faithful Minnie to do the actual work; and swears by all her\r\nGods and Goddesses she will only direct.\r\n\r\nIt would only make her unhappy if I did not make pretend to believe,\r\nand hope no harm may come of it.\r\n\r\nTout a vous,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Another discussion which sprang up in the \"Times\", upon Medical\r\nEducation, evoked a letter from him (\"Times\" August 7), urging that the\r\npreliminary training ought to be much more thorough and exact. The\r\nstudent at his first coming is so completely habituated to learn only\r\nfrom books or oral teaching, that the attempt to learn from things and\r\nto get his knowledge at first hand is something new and strange. Thus a\r\nlarge proportion of medical students spend much of their first year in\r\nlearning how to learn, and when they have done that, in acquiring the\r\npreliminary scientific knowledge, with which, under any rational system\r\nof education, they would have come provided.\r\n\r\nHe urged, too, that they should have received a proper literary\r\neducation instead of a sham acquaintance with Latin, and insisted, as\r\nhe had so often done, on the literary wealth of their own language.\r\n\r\nEvery one has his own ideas of what a liberal education ought to\r\ninclude, and a correspondent wrote to ask him, among other things,\r\nwhether he did not think the higher mathematics ought to be included.\r\nHe replied:--]\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, August 16, 1890.\r\n\r\nI think mathematical training highly desirable, but advanced\r\nmathematics, I am afraid, would be too great a burden in proportion to\r\nits utility, to the ordinary student.\r\n\r\nI fully agree with you that the incapacity of teachers is the weak\r\npoint in the London schools. But what is to be expected when a man\r\naccepts a lectureship in a medical school simply as a grappling-iron by\r\nwhich he may hold on until he gets a hospital appointment?\r\n\r\nMedical education in London will never be what it ought to be, until\r\nthe \"Institutes of Medicine,\" as the Scotch call them, are taught in\r\nonly two or three well-found institutions--while the hospital schools\r\nare confined to the teaching of practical medicine, surgery,\r\nobstetrics, and so on.\r\n\r\n[The following letters illustrate Huxley's keenness to correct any\r\nmisrepresentation of his opinions from a weighty source, amid the way\r\nin which, without abating his just claims, he could make the peace\r\ngracefully.\r\n\r\nIn October Dr. Abbott delivered an address on \"Illusions,\" in which,\r\nwithout, of course, mentioning names, he drew an unmistakable picture\r\nof Huxley as a thorough pessimist. A very brief report appeared in the\r\n\"Times\" of October 9, together with a leading article upon the subject.\r\nHuxley thereupon wrote to the \"Times\" a letter which throws light both\r\nupon his early days and his later opinions:--]\r\n\r\nThe article on \"Illusions\" in the \"Times\" of to-day induces me to\r\nnotice the remarkable exemplification of them to which you have drawn\r\npublic attention. The Reverend Dr. Abbott has pointed the moral of his\r\ndiscourse by a reference to a living man, the delicacy of which will be\r\nwidely and justly appreciated. I have reason to believe that I am\r\nacquainted with this person, somewhat intimately, though I can by no\r\nmeans call myself his best friend--far from it.\r\n\r\nIf I am right, I can affirm that this poor fellow did not escape from\r\nthe \"narrow school in which he was brought up\" at nineteen, but more\r\nthan two years later; and, as he pursued his studies in London, perhaps\r\nhe had as many opportunities for \"fruitful converse with friends and\r\nequals,\" to say nothing of superiors, as he would have enjoyed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nMoreover, whether the naval officers with whom he consorted were\r\nbook-learned or not, they were emphatically men, trained to face\r\nrealities and to have a wholesome contempt for mere talkers. Any one of\r\nthem was worth a wilderness of phrase-crammed undergraduates. Indeed, I\r\nhave heard my misguided acquaintance declare that he regards his four\r\nyears' training under the hard conditions and the sharp discipline of\r\nhis cruise as an education of inestimable value.\r\n\r\nAs to being a \"keen-witted pessimist out and out,\" the Reverend Dr.\r\nAbbott's \"horrid example\" has shown me the following\r\nsentence:--\"Pessimism is as little consonant with the facts of sentient\r\nexistence as optimism.\" He says he published it in 1888, in an article\r\non \"Industrial Development,\" to be seen in the \"Nineteenth Century\".\r\nBut no doubt this is another illusion. No superior person, brought up\r\n\"in the Universities,\" to boot, could possibly have invented a myth so\r\ncircumstantial.\r\n\r\n[The end of the correspondence was quite amicable. Dr. Abbott explained\r\nthat he had taken his facts from the recently published\r\n\"Autobiography,\" and that the reporters had wonderfully altered what he\r\nreally said by large omissions. In a second letter (\"Times\" October 11)\r\nHuxley says:--]\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to Dr. Abbott for his courteous explanation. I myself\r\nhave suffered so many things at the hands of so many reporters--of whom\r\nit may too often be said that their \"faith, unfaithful, makes them\r\nfalsely true\"--that I can fully enter into what his feelings must have\r\nbeen when he contemplated the picture of his discourse, in which the\r\nlights on \"raw midshipmen,\" \"pessimist out and out,\" \"devil take the\r\nhindmost,\" and \"Heine's dragoon,\" were so high, while the \"good things\"\r\nhe was kind enough to say about me lay in the deep shadow of the\r\ninvisible. And I can assure Dr. Abbott that I should not have dreamed\r\nof noticing the report of his interesting lecture, which I read when it\r\nappeared, had it not been made the subject of the leading article which\r\ndrew the attention of all the world to it on the following day.\r\n\r\nI was well aware that Dr. Abbott must have founded his remarks on the\r\nbrief notice of my life which (without my knowledge) has been thrust\r\ninto its present ridiculous position among biographies of eminent\r\nmusicians; and most undoubtedly anything I have said there is public\r\nproperty. But erroneous suppositions imaginatively connected with what\r\nI have said appear to me to stand upon a different footing, especially\r\nwhen they are interspersed with remarks injurious to my early friends.\r\nSome of the \"raw midshipmen and unlearned naval officers\" of whom Dr.\r\nAbbott speaks, in terms which he certainly did not find in my\r\n\"autobiography,\" are, I am glad to say, still alive, and are\r\nperforming, or have performed, valuable services to their country. I\r\nwonder what Dr. Abbott would think, and perhaps say, if his youthful\r\nUniversity friends were spoken of as \"raw curates and unlearned country\r\nsquires.\"\r\n\r\nWhen David Hume's housemaid was wroth because somebody chalked up \"St\r\nDavid's\" on his house, the philosopher is said to have remarked,--\"\r\nNever mind, lassie, better men than I have been made saints of before\r\nnow.\" And, perhaps, if I had recollected that \"better men than I have\r\nbeen made texts of before now,\" a slight flavour of wrath which may be\r\nperceptible would have vanished from my first letter. If Dr. Abbott has\r\nfound any phrase of mine too strong, I beg him to set it against \"out\r\nand out pessimist\" and \"Heine's dragoon,\" and let us cry quits. He is\r\nthe last person with whom I should wish to quarrel.\r\n\r\n[Two interesting criticisms of books follow; one \"The First Three\r\nGospels\", by the Reverend Estlin Carpenter; the other on \"Use and\r\nDisuse\", directed against the doctrine of use-inheritance, by Mr. Platt\r\nBall, who not only sent the book but appealed to him for advice as to\r\nhis future course in undertaking a larger work on the evolution of man.]\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, October 11, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Carpenter,\r\n\r\nAccept my best thanks for \"The First Three Gospels\", which strikes me\r\nas an admirable exposition of the case, full, clear, and calm. Indeed\r\nthe latter quality gives it here and there a touch of humour. You say\r\nthe most damaging things in a way so gentle that the orthodox reader\r\nmust feel like the eels who were skinned by the fair Molly--lost\r\nbetween pain and admiration.\r\n\r\nI am certainly glad to see that the book has reached a second edition;\r\nit will do yeoman's service to the cause of right reason.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine was in the habit of sending me his proofs, and I\r\nsometimes wrote on them \"no objection except to the whole\"; and I am\r\nafraid that you will think what I am about to say comes to pretty much\r\nthe same thing--at least if I am right in the supposition that a\r\npassage in your first preface (page 7) states your fundamental\r\nposition, and that you conceive that when criticism has done its\r\nuttermost there still remains evidence that the personality of Jesus\r\nwas the leading cause--the conditio sine qua non--of the evolution of\r\nChristianity from Judaism.\r\n\r\nI long thought so, and having a strong dislike to belittle the heroic\r\nfigures of history, I held by the notion as long as I could, but I find\r\nit melting away.\r\n\r\nI cannot see that the moral and religious ideal of early Christianity\r\nis new--on the other hand, it seems to me to be implicitly and\r\nexplicitly contained in the early prophetic Judaism and the later\r\nHellenised Judaism; and though it is quite true that the new vitality\r\nof the old ideal manifested in early Christianity demands \"an adequate\r\nhistoric cause,\" I would suggest that the word \"cause\" may mislead if\r\nit is not carefully defined.\r\n\r\nMedical philosophy draws a most useful and necessary distinction\r\nbetween \"exciting\" and \"predisposing\" causes--and nowhere is it more\r\nneedful to keep this distinction in mind than in history--and\r\nespecially in estimating the action of individuals on the course of\r\nhuman affairs. Platonic and Stoical philosophy--prophetic\r\nliberalism--the strong democratic socialism of the Jewish political\r\nsystem--the existence of innumerable sodalities for religious and\r\nsocial purposes--had thrown the ancient world into a state of unstable\r\nequilibrium. With such predisposing causes at work, the exciting cause\r\nof enormous changes might be relatively insignificant. The powder was\r\nthere--a child might throw the match which should blow up the whole\r\nconcern.\r\n\r\nI do not want to seem irreverent, still less depreciatory, of noble\r\nmen, but it strikes me that in the present case the Nazarenes were the\r\nmatch and Paul the child.\r\n\r\nAn ingrained habit of trying to explain the unknown by the known leads\r\nme to find the key to Nazarenism in Quakerism. It is impossible to read\r\nthe early history of the Friends without seeing that George Fox was a\r\nperson who exerted extraordinary influence over the men with whom he\r\ncame in contact; and it is equally impossible (at least for me) to\r\ndiscover in his copious remains an original thought.\r\n\r\nYet what with the corruption of the Stuarts, the Phariseeism of the\r\nPuritans, and the Sadduceeism of the Church, England was in such a\r\nstate, that before his death he had gathered about him a vast body of\r\ndevoted followers, whose patient endurance of persecution is a marvel.\r\nMoreover, the Quakers have exercised a prodigious influence on later\r\nEnglish life.\r\n\r\nBut I have scribbled a great deal too much already. You will see what I\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. W. Platt Ball.\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, October 27, 1890.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have been through your book, which has greatly interested me, at a\r\nhand-gallop; and I have by no means given it the attention it deserves.\r\nBut the day after to-morrow I shall be going into a new house here, and\r\nit may be some time before I settle down to work in it--so that I\r\nprefer to seem hasty, rather than indifferent to your book and still\r\nmore to your letter.\r\n\r\nAs to the book, in the first place. The only criticism I have to\r\noffer--in the ordinary depreciatory sense of the word--is that pages\r\n128 to 137 seem to me to require reconsideration, partly from a\r\nsubstantial and partly from a tactical point of view. There is much\r\nthat is disputable on the one hand, and not necessary to your argument\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nOtherwise it seems to me that the case could hardly be better stated.\r\nHere are a few notes and queries that have occurred to me.\r\n\r\nPage 41. Extinction of Tasmanians--rather due to the British colonist,\r\nwho was the main agent of their extirpation, I fancy.\r\n\r\nPage 67. Birds' sternums are a great deal more than surfaces of origin\r\nfor the pectoral muscles--e.g. movable lid of respiratory bellows. This\r\nnot taken into account by Darwin.\r\n\r\nPage 85. \"Inferiority of senses of Europeans\" is, I believe, a pure\r\ndelusion. Professor Marsh told me of feats of American trappers equal\r\nto any savage doings. It is a question of attention. Consider\r\nwool-sorters, tea-tasters, shepherds who know every sheep personally,\r\netc. etc.\r\n\r\nPage 85. I do not understand about the infant's sole; since all men\r\nbecome bipeds, all must exert pressure on sole. There is no disuse.\r\n\r\nPage 88. Has not \"muscardine\" been substituted for \"pebrine\"? I have\r\nalways considered this a very striking case. Here is apparent\r\ninheritance of a diseased state through the mother only, quite\r\ninexplicable till Pasteur discovered the rationale.\r\n\r\nPage 155. Have you considered that State Socialism (for which I have\r\nlittle enough love) may be a product of Natural Selection? The\r\nsocieties of Bees and Ants exhibit socialism in excelsis.\r\n\r\nThe unlucky substitution of \"survival of fittest\" for \"natural\r\nselection\" has done much harm in consequence of the ambiguity of\r\n\"fittest\"--which many take to mean \"best\" or \"highest\"--whereas natural\r\nselection may work towards degradation: vide epizoa.\r\n\r\nYou do not refer to the male mamma--which becomes functional once in\r\nmany million cases, see the curious records of Gynaecomasty. Here\r\npractical disuse in the male ever since the origin of the mammalia has\r\nnot abolished the mamma or destroyed its functional potentiality in\r\nextremely rare cases.\r\n\r\nI absolutely disbelieve in use-inheritance as the evidence stands.\r\nSpencer is bound to it a priori--his psychology goes to pieces without\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow as to the letter. I am no pessimist--but also no optimist. The\r\nworld might be much worse, and it might be much better. Of moral\r\npurpose I see no trace in Nature. That is an article of exclusively\r\nhuman manufacture--and very much to our credit.\r\n\r\nIf you will accept the results of the experience of an old man who has\r\nhad a very chequered existence--and has nothing to hope for except a\r\nfew years of quiet downhill--there is nothing of permanent value\r\n(putting aside a few human affections), nothing that satisfies quiet\r\nreflection--except the sense of having worked according to one's\r\ncapacity and light, to make things clear and get rid of cant and shams\r\nof all sorts. That was the lesson I learned from Carlyle's books when I\r\nwas a boy, and it has stuck by me all my life.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my advice to you is go ahead. You may make more of failing\r\nto get money, and of succeeding in getting abuse--until such time in\r\nyour life as (if you are teachable) you have ceased to care much about\r\neither. The job you propose to undertake is a big one, and will tax all\r\nyour energies and all your patience.\r\n\r\nBut, if it were my case, I should take my chance of failing in a worthy\r\ntask rather than of succeeding in lower things.\r\n\r\nAnd if at any time I can be of use to you (even to the answering of\r\nletters) let me know. But in truth I am getting rusty in science--from\r\ndisuse.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Yes--Mr. Gladstone has dug up the hatchet. We shall see who gets\r\nthe scalps.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you have not referred to plants, which are a stronghold for\r\nyou. What is the good of use-inheritance, say, in orchids?\r\n\r\n[The interests which had formerly been divided between biology and\r\nother branches of science and philosophy, were diverted from the one\r\nchannel only to run stronger in the rest. Stagnation was the one thing\r\nimpossible to him; his rest was mental activity without excessive\r\nphysical fatigue; and he felt he still had a useful purpose to serve,\r\nas a friend put it, in patrolling his beat with a vigilant eye to the\r\nloose characters of thought. Thus he writes on September 29 to Sir J.\r\nHooker:--]\r\n\r\nI wish quietude of mind were possible to me. But without something to\r\ndo that amuses me and does not involve too much labour, I become quite\r\nunendurable--to myself and everybody else.\r\n\r\nProvidence has, I believe, specially devolved on Gladstone, Gore, and\r\nCo. the function of keeping \"'ome 'appy\" for me.\r\n\r\nI really can't give up tormenting ces droles.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have been toiling at a tremendously scientific article about\r\nthe \"Aryan question\" absolutely devoid of blasphemy.\r\n\r\n[This article appeared in the November number of the \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury\" (\"Collected Essays\" 7 271) and treats the question from a\r\nbiological point of view, with the warning to readers that it is\r\nessentially a speculation based upon facts, but not assuredly proved.\r\nIt starts from the racial characteristics of skull and stature, not\r\nfrom simply philological considerations, and arrives at a form of the\r\n\"Sarmatian\" theory of Aryan origins. And for fear lest he should be\r\nsupposed to take sides in the question of race and language, or race\r\nand civilisation, he remarks:--]\r\n\r\nThe combination of swarthiness with stature above the average and a\r\nlong skull, confer upon me the serene impartiality of a mongrel.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Hotel, Eastbourne, August 12, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Evans,\r\n\r\nI have read your address returned herewith with a great deal of\r\ninterest, as I happen to have been amusing myself lately with reviewing\r\nthe \"Aryan\" question according to the new lights (or darknesses).\r\n\r\nI have only two or three remarks to offer on the places I have marked A\r\nand B.\r\n\r\nAs to A, I would not state the case so strongly against the\r\nprobabilities of finding pliocene man. A pliocene Homo skeleton might\r\nanalogically be expected to differ no more from that of modern men than\r\nthe Oeningen Canis from modern Canes, or pliocene horses from modern\r\nhorses. If so, he would most undoubtedly be a man--genus Homo--even if\r\nyou made him a distinct species. For my part I should by no means be\r\nastonished to find the genus Homo represented in the Miocene, say the\r\nNeanderthal man with rather smaller brain capacity, longer arms and\r\nmore movable great toe, but at most specifically different.\r\n\r\nAs to B, I rather think there were people who fought the fallacy of\r\nlanguage being a test of race before Broca--among them thy servant--who\r\ngot into considerable hot water on that subject for a lecture on the\r\nforefathers and forerunners of the English people, delivered in 1870.\r\nTaylor says that Cuno was the first to insist upon the proposition that\r\nrace is not co-extensive with language in 1871. That is all stuff. The\r\nsame thesis had been maintained before I took it up, but I cannot\r\nremember by whom. [Cp. letter to Max Muller of June 15, 1865 volume 1.]\r\n\r\nWon't you refer to the Blackmore Museum? I was very much struck with it\r\nwhen at Salisbury the other day.\r\n\r\nHope they gave you a better lunch at Gloucester than we did here. We'll\r\ntreat you better next time in our own den. With the wife's kindest\r\nregards.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The remark in a preceding letter about \"Gladstone, Gore, and Co.\"\r\nturned out to be prophetic as well as retrospective. Mr. Gladstone\r\npublished this autumn in \"Good Words\" his \"Impregnable Rock of Holy\r\nScripture,\" containing an attack upon Huxley's position as taken up in\r\ntheir previous controversy of 1889.\r\n\r\nThe debate now turned upon the story of the Gadarene swine. The\r\nquestion at issue was not, at first sight, one of vital importance, and\r\none critic at least remarked that at their age Mr. Gladstone and\r\nProfessor Huxley might be better occupied than in fighting over the\r\nGadarene pigs:--]\r\n\r\nIf these too famous swine were the only parties to the suit, I for my\r\npart (writes Huxley, \"Collected Essays\" 5 414) should fully admit the\r\njustice of the rebuke. But the real issue (he contends) is whether the\r\nmen of the nineteenth century are to adopt the demonology of the men of\r\nthe first century, as divinely revealed truth, or to reject it as\r\ndegrading falsity.\r\n\r\n[A lively encounter followed:--]\r\n\r\nThe G.O.M. is not murdered [he writes on November 20], only \"fillipped\r\nwith a three-man beetle,\" as the fat knight has it.\r\n\r\n[This refers to the forthcoming article in the December \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury\", \"The Keepers of the Herd of Swine,\" which was followed in\r\nMarch 1891 by \"Mr. Gladstone's Controversial Methods\" (see \"Collected\r\nEssays\" 5 366 sqq.), the rejoinder to Mr. Gladstone's reply in February.\r\n\r\nThe scope of this controversy was enlarged by the intervention in the\r\nJanuary \"Nineteenth Century\" of the Duke of Argyll, to whom he devoted\r\nthe concluding paragraphs of his March article. But it was scarcely\r\nwell under way when another, accompanied by much greater effusion of\r\nink and passion, sprang up in the columns of the \"Times\". His share in\r\nit, published in 1891 as a pamphlet under the title of \"Social Diseases\r\nand Worse Remedies,\" is to be found in \"Collected Essays\" 9 237.]\r\n\r\nI have a new row on hand in re Salvation Army! [he writes on December\r\n2]. It's all Mrs. --'s fault; she offered the money.\r\n\r\n[In fact, a lady who was preparing to subscribe 1000 pounds to\r\n\"General\" Booth's \"Darkest England\" scheme, begged Huxley first to give\r\nher his opinion of the scheme and the likelihood of its being properly\r\ncarried out. A careful examination of \"Darkest England\" and other\r\nauthorities on the subject, convinced him that it was most unwise to\r\ncreate an organisation whose absolute obedience to an irresponsible\r\nleader might some day become a serious danger to the State; that the\r\nreforms proposed were already being undertaken by other bodies, which\r\nwould be crippled if this scheme were floated; and that the financial\r\narrangements of the Army were not such as provide guarantees for the\r\nproper administration of the funds subscribed:--]\r\n\r\nAnd if the thing goes on much longer, if Booth establishes his Bank,\r\nyou will have a crash some of these fine days, comparable only to Law's\r\nMississippi business, but unfortunately ruining only the poor.\r\n\r\n[On the same day he writes to his eldest son:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, December 8, 1890.\r\n\r\nAttacking the Salvation Army may look like the advance of a forlorn\r\nhope, but this old dog has never yet let go after fixing his teeth into\r\nanything or anybody, and he is not going to begin now. And it is only a\r\nquestion of holding on. Look at Plumptre's letter exposing the Bank\r\nswindle.\r\n\r\nThe \"Times\", too, is behaving like a brick. This world is not a very\r\nlovely place, but down at the bottom, as old Carlyle preached, veracity\r\ndoes really lie, and will show itself if people won't be impatient.\r\n\r\n[No sooner had he begun to express these opinions in the columns of the\r\n\"Times\" than additional information of all kinds poured in upon him,\r\nespecially from within the Army, much of it private for fear of injury\r\nto the writers if it were discovered that they had written to expose\r\nabuses; indeed in one case the writer had thought better of even\r\nappending his signature to his letter, and had cut off his name from\r\nthe foot of it, alleging that correspondence was not inviolable. So far\r\nwere these persons from feeling hostility to the organisation to which\r\nthey belonged, that one at least hailed the Professor as the\r\ndivinely-appointed redeemer of the Army, whose criticism was to bring\r\nit back to its pristine purity.\r\n\r\nTo his elder son:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 8, 1891.\r\n\r\nDear Lens,\r\n\r\nIt is very jolly to think of J. and you paying us a visit. It is\r\nproper, also, the eldest son should hansel the house.\r\n\r\nIs the Mr. Sidgwick who took up the cudgels for me so gallantly in the\r\n\"St. James'\" one of your Sidgwicks? If so, I wish you would thank him\r\non my account. (The letter was capital.) [Mr. William C. Sidgwick had\r\nwritten (January 4) an indignant letter to protest against the heading\r\nof an article in the \"Speaker\", Professor Huxley as Titus Oates.\" \"To\r\nthis monster of iniquity the \"Speaker\" compares an honourable English\r\ngentleman, because he has ventured to dissuade his countrymen from\r\ngiving money to Mr. William Booth...Mr. Huxley's views on theology may\r\nbe wrong, but nobody doubts that he honestly holds them; they do not\r\nbring Mr. Huxley wealth and honours, nor do they cause the murder of\r\nthe innocent. To insinuate a resemblance which you dare not state\r\nopenly is an outrage on common decency...] Generally people like me to\r\npull the chestnuts out of the fire for them, but don't care to take any\r\nshare in the burning of the fingers.\r\n\r\nBut the Boothites are hard hit, and may be allowed to cry out.\r\n\r\nI begin to think that they must be right in saying that the Devil is at\r\nwork to destroy them. No other theory sufficiently accounts for the way\r\nthey play into my hands. Poor Clibborn-Booth has a long--columns\r\nlong--letter in the \"Times\" to-day, in which, all unbeknownst to\r\nhimself, he proves my case.\r\n\r\nI do believe it is a veritable case of the herd of swine, and I shall\r\nhave to admit the probability of that miracle.\r\n\r\nLove to J. and Co. from us all.\r\n\r\nEver your affectionate Pater.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 11, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Clodd,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged to you for the number of the \"St. James's\r\nGazette\", which I had not seen. The leading article expresses exactly\r\nthe same conclusions as those at which I had myself arrived from the\r\nstudy of the deed of 1878. But of course I was not going to entangle\r\nmyself in a legal discussion. However, I have reason to know that the\r\nquestion will be dealt with by a highly qualified legal expert before\r\nlong. The more I see of the operations of headquarters the worse they\r\nlook. I get some of my most valuable information and heartiest\r\nencouragement from officers of the Salvation Army; and I knew, in this\r\nway, of Smith's resignation a couple of days before it was announced!\r\nBut the poor fellows are so afraid of spies and consequent persecution,\r\nthat some implore me not to notice their letters, and all pledge me to\r\nsecrecy. So that I am Vice-Fontanelle with my hand full of truth, while\r\nI can only open my little finger.\r\n\r\nIt is a case of one down and t'other come on, just now. \"--\" will get\r\nhis deserts in due time. But, oh dear, what a waste of time for a man\r\nwho has not much to look to. No; \"waste\" is the wrong word; it's\r\nuseful, but I wish that somebody else would do it and leave me to my\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nMy wife desires her kind regards. I am happy to say she is now\r\nremarkably well. If you are this way, pray look in at our Hermitage.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 30, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI trust I have done with Booth and Co. at last. What an ass a man is to\r\ntry to prevent his fellow-creatures from being humbugged! Surely I am\r\nold enough to know better. I have not been so well abused for an age.\r\nIt's quite like old times.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have to settle accounts with the Duke and the G.O.M. I wonder\r\nwhen the wicked will let me be at peace.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Other letters touch upon the politics of the hour, especially upon the\r\nsudden and dramatic fall of Parnell. He could not but admire the power\r\nand determination of the man, and his political methods, an admiration\r\nrashly interpreted by some journalist as admiration of the objects to\r\nwhich these political methods were applied. (See Volume 2.)]\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, November 26, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lecky,\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for your two volumes, which I rejoice to have,\r\nespecially as a present from you. I was only waiting until we were\r\nsettled in our new house--as I hope we shall be this time next week--to\r\nadd them to the set which already adorn my shelves, and I promise\r\nmyself soon to enjoy the reading of them.\r\n\r\nThe Unionist cause is looking up. What a strange thing it is that the\r\nIrish malcontents are always sold, one way or the other, by their\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the G.O.M. ever swears! Pity if he can't have that relief\r\njust now.\r\n\r\nWith our united kind regards to Mrs. Lecky and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, November 29, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have filled up and sent your and my copies of entry for Athenaeum.\r\n\r\nCarpenter has written the best popular statement I know of, of the\r\nresults of criticism, in a little book called \"The First Three\r\nGospels\", which is well worth reading. [See above.]\r\n\r\nI have promised to go to the Royal Society dinner and propose Stokes'\r\nhealth on Monday, but if the weather holds out as Arctic as it is now,\r\nI shall not dare to venture. The driving east wind, blowing the snow\r\nbefore it here, has been awful; for ten years they have had nothing\r\nlike it. I am glad to say that my little house turns out to be warm. We\r\ngo in next Wednesday, and I fear I cannot be in town on Thursday even\r\nif the weather permits.\r\n\r\nI have had pleurisy that was dangerous and not painful, then pleurisy\r\nthat was painful and not dangerous; there is only one further\r\ncombination, and I don't want that.\r\n\r\nPolitics now are immensely interesting. There must be a depth of\r\nblackguardism in me, for I cannot help admiring Parnell. I prophesy\r\nthat it is Gladstone who will retire for a while, and then come back to\r\nParnell's heel like a whipped hound. His letter was carefully full of\r\nloopholes.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, December 2, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe question of questions now is whether the Unionists will have the\r\nsense to carry a measure settling the land question at once. If they do\r\nthat, I do not believe it will be in the power of man to stir them\r\nfurther. And my belief is that Parnell will be quite content with that\r\nsolution. He does not want to be made a nonentity by Davitt or the\r\nIrish Americans.\r\n\r\nBut what ingrained liars they all are! That is the bottom of all Irish\r\ntrouble. Fancy Healy and Sexton going to Dublin to swear eternal\r\nfidelity to their leader, and now openly declaring that they only did\r\nso because they believed he would resign.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, January 10, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI am trying to bring the Booth business to an end so far as I am\r\nconcerned, but it's like getting a wolf by the ears; you can't let him\r\ngo exactly when you like.\r\n\r\nBut the result is quite worth the trouble. Booth, Stead, Tillett,\r\nManning and Co. have their little game spoilt for the present.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine the quantity of letters I get from the Salvation\r\nArmy subordinates, thanking me and telling me all sorts of stories in\r\nstrict confidence. The poor devils are frightened out of their lives by\r\nheadquarter spies. Some beg me not to reply, as their letters are\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nI knew that saints were not bad hands at lying before; but these Booth\r\npeople beat Banagher.\r\n\r\nThen there is -- awaits skinning, and I believe the G.O.M. is to be\r\nupon me! Oh for a quiet life.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[But by February 17 the Booth business was over, the final rejoinder to\r\nMr. Gladstone sent to press; and he writes to Sir J. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nPlease the pigs, I have now done with them--wiped my month, and am\r\ngoing to be good--till next time.\r\n\r\nBut in truth I am as sick of controversy as a confectioner's boy of\r\ntarts.\r\n\r\nI rather think I shall set up as a political prophet. Gladstone and all\r\nthe rest are coming to heel to their master.\r\n\r\nYears ago one of the present leaders of the anti-Parnellites said to\r\nme: \"Gladstone is always in the hands of somebody stronger than\r\nhimself; formerly it was Bright, now it is Parnell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.8.\r\n\r\n1890-1891.\r\n\r\n[The new house at Eastbourne has been several times referred to. As\r\nusually happens, the move was considerably delayed by the slowness of\r\nthe workmen; it did not actually take place till the beginning of\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nHe writes to his daughter, Mrs. Roller, who also had just moved into a\r\nnew house:--]\r\n\r\nYou have all my sympathies on the buy, buy question. I never knew\r\nbefore that when you go into a new house money runs out at the heels of\r\nyour boots. On former occasions, I have been too busy to observe the\r\nfact. But I am convinced now that it is a law of nature.\r\n\r\n[The origin of the name given to the house appears from the following\r\nletter:--]\r\n\r\nGrand Hotel, Eastbourne, October 15, 1890.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for the third part of the \"Physiology,\" which I found when\r\nI ran up to town for a day or two last week. What a grind that book\r\nmust be.\r\n\r\nHow's a' wi' you? Let me have a line.\r\n\r\nWe ought to have been in our house a month ago, but fitters, paperers,\r\nand polishers are like bugs or cockroaches, you may easily get 'em in,\r\nbut getting 'em out is the deuce. However, I hope to clear them out by\r\nthe end of this week, and get in by the end of next week.\r\n\r\nOne is obliged to have names for houses here. Mine will be \"Hodeslea,\"\r\nwhich is as near as I can go to \"Hodesleia,\" the poetical original\r\nshape of my very ugly name.\r\n\r\nThere was a noble scion of the house of Huxley of Huxley who, having\r\nburgled and done other wrong things (temp. Henry IV.), asked for\r\nbenefit of clergy. I expect they gave it him, not in the way he wanted,\r\nbut in the way they would like to \"benefit\" a later member of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n[Rough sketch of one priest hauling the rope taut over the gallows,\r\nwhile another holds a crucifix before the suspended criminal.]\r\n\r\nBetween this gentleman and my grandfather there is unfortunately a\r\ncomplete blank, but I have none the less faith in him as my ancestor.\r\n\r\nMy wife, I am sorry to say, is in town--superintending packing up--no\r\nstopping her. I have been very uneasy about her at times, and shall be\r\nglad when we are quietly settled down. With kindest regards to Mrs.\r\nFoster.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[His own principal task was in getting his library ready for the move.]\r\n\r\nMost of my time [he writes on November 16] for the last fortnight has\r\nbeen spent in arranging books and tearing up papers till my back aches\r\nand my fingers are sore.\r\n\r\n[However, he did not take all his books with him. There was a quantity\r\nof biological works of all sorts which had accumulated in his library\r\nand which he was not likely to use again; these he offered as a parting\r\ngift to the Royal College of Science. On December 8, the Registrar\r\nconveys to him the thanks of the Council for \"the valuable library of\r\nbiological works,\" and further informs him that it was resolved:--\r\n\r\nThat the library shall be kept in the room formerly occupied by the\r\nDean, which shall be called \"The Huxley Laboratory for Biological\r\nResearch,\" and be devoted to the prosecution of original researches in\r\nBiological Science, with which the name of Professor Huxley is\r\ninseparably associated.\r\n\r\nHuxley replied as follows:--]\r\n\r\nDear Registrar,\r\n\r\nI beg you convey my hearty thanks to the Council for the great kindness\r\nof the minute and resolution which you have sent me. My mind has never\r\nbeen greatly set on posthumous fame; but there is no way of keeping\r\nmemory green which I should like so well as that which they have\r\nadopted towards me.\r\n\r\nIt has been my fate to receive a good deal more vilipending than (I\r\nhope) I deserve. If my colleagues, with whom I have worked so long, put\r\ntoo high a value upon my services, perhaps the result may be not far\r\noff justice.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the directly controversial articles in the early part of\r\nthe year, two other articles on controversial subjects belong to 1891.\r\n\"Hasisadra's Adventure,\" published in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for\r\nJune, completed his long-contemplated examination of the Flood myth. In\r\nthis he first discussed the Babylonian form of the legend recorded upon\r\nthe clay tablets of Assurbanipal--a simpler and less exaggerated form\r\nas befits an earlier version, and in its physical details keeping much\r\nnearer to the bounds of probability.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the article, however, is devoted to a wider\r\nquestion--How far does geological and geographical evidence bear\r\nwitness to the consequences which must have ensued from a universal\r\nflood, or even from one limited to the countries of Mesopotamia? And he\r\ncomes to the conclusion that these very countries have been singularly\r\nfree from any great changes of the kind for long geological periods.\r\n\r\nThe sarcastic references in this article to those singular reasoners\r\nwho take the possibility of an occurrence to be the same as scientific\r\ntestimony to the fact of its occurrence, lead up, more or less, to the\r\nsubject of an essay, \"Possibilities and Impossibilities,\" which\r\nappeared in the \"Agnostic Annual\" for 1892, actually published in\r\nOctober 1891, and to be found in \"Collected Essays\", 5 192.\r\n\r\nThis was a restatement of the fundamental principles of the agnostic\r\nposition, arising out of the controversies of the last two years upon\r\nthe demonology of the New Testament. The miraculous is not to be denied\r\nas impossible; as Hume said, \"Whatever is intelligible and can be\r\ndistinctly conceived implies no contradiction, and can never be proved\r\nfalse by any demonstrative argument or abstract reasoning a priori,\"\r\nand these combinations of phenomena are perfectly conceivable.\r\nMoreover, in the progress of knowledge, the miracles of to-day may be\r\nthe science of to-morrow. Improbable they are, certainly, by all\r\nexperience, and therefore they require specially strong evidence. But\r\nthis is precisely what they lack; the evidence for them, when examined,\r\nturns out to be of doubtful value.]\r\n\r\nI am anxious [he says] to bring about a clear understanding of the\r\ndifference between \"impossibilities\" and \"improbabilities,\" because\r\nmistakes on this point lay us open to the attacks of ecclesiastical\r\napologists of the type of the late Cardinal Newman.\r\n\r\nWhen it is rightly stated, the Agnostic view of \"miracles\" is, in my\r\njudgment, unassailable. We are NOT justified in the a priori assertion\r\nthat the order of nature, as experience has revealed it to us, cannot\r\nchange. In arguing about the miraculous, the assumption is\r\nillegitimate, because it involves the whole point in dispute.\r\nFurthermore, it is an assumption which takes us beyond the range of our\r\nfaculties. Obviously, no amount of past experience can warrant us in\r\nanything more than a correspondingly strong expectation for the present\r\nand future. We find, practically, that expectations, based upon careful\r\nobservations of past events, are, as a rule, trustworthy. We should be\r\nfoolish indeed not to follow the only guide we have through life. But,\r\nfor all that, our highest and surest generalisations remain on the\r\nlevel of justifiable expectations; that is, very high probabilities.\r\nFor my part, I am unable to conceive of an intelligence shaped on the\r\nmodel of that of men, however superior it might be, which could be any\r\nbetter off than our own in this respect; that is, which could possess\r\nlogically justifiable grounds for certainty about the constancy of the\r\norder of things, and therefore be in a position to declare that such\r\nand such events are impossible. Some of the old mythologies recognised\r\nthis clearly enough. Beyond and above Zeus and Odin, there lay the\r\nunknown and inscrutable Fate which, one day or other, would crumple up\r\nthem and the world they ruled to give place to a new order of things.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that I shall not be accused of Pyrrhonism, or of any\r\ndesire to weaken the foundations of rational certainty. I have merely\r\ndesired to point out that rational certainty is one thing, and talk\r\nabout \"impossibilities,\" or \"violation of natural laws,\" another.\r\nRational certainty rests upon two grounds; the one that the evidence in\r\nfavour of a given statement is as good as it can be; the other, that\r\nsuch evidence is plainly insufficient. In the former case, the\r\nstatement is to be taken as true, in the latter as untrue; until\r\nsomething arises to modify the verdict, which, however properly\r\nreached, may always be more or less wrong, the best information being\r\nnever complete, and the best reasoning being liable to fallacy.\r\n\r\nTo quarrel with the uncertainty that besets us in intellectual affairs\r\nwould be about as reasonable as to object to live one's life, with due\r\nthought for the morrow, because no man can be sure he will be alive an\r\nhour hence. Such are the conditions imposed upon us by nature, and we\r\nhave to make the best of them. And I think that the greatest mistake\r\nthose of us who are interested in the progress of free thought can make\r\nis to overlook these limitations, and to deck ourselves with the\r\ndogmatic feathers which are the traditional adornment of our opponents.\r\nLet us be content with rational certainty, leaving irrational\r\ncertainties to those who like to muddle their minds with them.\r\n\r\n[As for the difficulty of believing miracles in themselves, he gives in\r\nthis paper several examples of a favourite saying of his, that Science\r\noffers us much greater marvels than the miracles of theology; only the\r\nevidence for them is very different.\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written in acknowledgment of a paper by the\r\nReverend E. McClure, which endeavoured to place the belief in an\r\nindividual permanence upon the grounds that we know of no leakage\r\nanywhere in nature; that matter is not a source, but a transmitter of\r\nenergy; and that the brain, so far from originating thought, is a mere\r\nmachine responsive to something external to itself, a revealer of\r\nsomething which it does not produce, like a musical instrument. This\r\n\"something\" is the universal of thought, which is identified with the\r\ngeneral logos of the fourth gospel. Moral perfection consists in\r\nassimilation to this; sin is the falling short of perfect revealing of\r\nthe eternal logos.\r\n\r\nHuxley's reply interested his correspondent not only for the brief\r\nopinion on the philosophic question, but for the personal touch in the\r\nexplanation of the motives which had guided his life-work, and his\r\n\"kind feeling towards such of the clergy as endeavoured to seek\r\nhonestly for a natural basis to their faith.\"\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 17, 1891.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. McClure,\r\n\r\nI am very much obliged for your letter, which belongs to a different\r\ncategory from most of those which I receive from your side of the hedge\r\nthat, unfortunately, separates thinking men.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know myself, after making due deduction for the ambition of\r\nyouth and a fiery temper, which ought to (but unfortunately does not)\r\nget cooler with age, my sole motive is to get at the truth in all\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nI do not care one straw about fame, present or posthumous, and I loathe\r\nnotoriety, but I do care to have that desire manifest and recognised.\r\n\r\nYour paper deals with a problem which has profoundly interested me for\r\nyears, but which I take to be insoluble. It would need a book for full\r\ndiscussion. But I offer a remark only on two points.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the conservation of energy tells neither one way nor\r\nthe other. Energy is the cause of movement of body, i.e. things having\r\nmass. States of consciousness have no mass, even if they can be\r\nconceded to be movable. Therefore even if they are caused by molecular\r\nmovements, they would not in any way affect the store of energy.\r\n\r\nPhysical causation need not be the only kind of causation, and when\r\nCabanis said that thought was a function of the brain, in the same way\r\nas bile secretion is a FUNCTION of the liver, he blundered\r\nphilosophically. Bile is a product of the transformation of material\r\nenergy. But in the mathematical sense of the word \"function,\" thought\r\nmay be a function of the brain. That is to say, it may arise only when\r\ncertain physical particles take on a certain order.\r\n\r\nBy way of a coarse analogy, consider a parallel-sided piece of glass\r\nthrough which light passes. It forms no picture. Shape it so as to be\r\nbi-convex, and a picture appears in its focus.\r\n\r\nIs not the formation of the picture a \"function\" of the piece of glass\r\nthus shaped?\r\n\r\nSo, from your own point of view, suppose a mind-stuff--logos---a\r\nnoumenal cosmic light such as is shadowed in the fourth gospel. The\r\nbrain of a dog will convert it into one set of phenomenal pictures, and\r\nthe brain of a man into another. But in both cases the result is the\r\nconsequence of the way in which the respective brains perform their\r\n\"functions.\"\r\n\r\nYet one point.\r\n\r\nThe actions we call sinful are as much the consequence of the order of\r\nnature as those we call virtuous. They are part and parcel of the\r\nstruggle for existence through which all living things have passed, and\r\nthey have become sins because man alone seeks a higher life in\r\nvoluntary association.\r\n\r\nTherefore the instrument has never been marred; on the contrary, we are\r\ntrying to get music out of harps, sacbuts, and psalteries, which never\r\nwere in tune and seemingly never will be.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Few years passed without some utterance from Huxley on the subject of\r\neducation, especially scientific education. This year we have a letter\r\nto Professor Ray Lankester touching the science teaching at Oxford.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 28, 1891.\r\n\r\nDear Lankester,\r\n\r\nI met Foster at the Athenaeum when I was in town last week, and we had\r\nsome talk about your \"very gentle\" stirring of the Oxford pudding. I\r\nasked him to let you know when occasion offered, that (as I had already\r\nsaid to Burdon Sanderson) I drew a clear line apud biology between the\r\nmedical student and the science student.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the former, I consider it ought to be kept within\r\nstrict limits, and made simply a Vorschule to human anatomy and\r\nphysiology.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the man who is going out in natural science ought to\r\nhave a much larger dose, especially in the direction of morphology.\r\nHowever, from what I understood from Foster, there seems a doubt about\r\nthe \"going out\" in \"Natural Science\", so I had better confine myself to\r\nthe medicos. Their burden is already so heavy that I do not want to see\r\nit increased by a needless weight even of elementary biology.\r\n\r\nVery many thanks for the \"Zoological articles\" just arrived.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nDon't write to the \"Times\" about anything; look at the trouble that\r\ncomes upon a harmless man for two months, in consequence.\r\n\r\n[The following letter, which I quote from the \"Yorkshire Herald\" of\r\nApril 11, 1891, was written in answer to some inquiries from Mr. J.\r\nHarrison, who read a paper on Technical Education as applied to\r\nAgriculture, before the Easingwold Agricultural Club.]\r\n\r\nI am afraid that my opinion upon the subject of your inquiry is worth\r\nvery little--my ignorance of practical agriculture being profound.\r\nHowever, there are some general principles which apply to all technical\r\ntraining; the first of these, I think, is that practice is to be\r\nlearned only by practice. The farmer must be made by and through farm\r\nwork. I believe I might be able to give you a fair account of a bean\r\nplant and of the manner and condition of its growth, but if I were to\r\ntry to raise a crop of beans, your club would probably laugh consumedly\r\nat the result. Nevertheless, I believe that you practical people would\r\nbe all the better for the scientific knowledge which does not enable me\r\nto grow beans. It would keep you from attempting hopeless experiments,\r\nand would enable you to take advantage of the innumerable hints which\r\nDame Nature gives to people who live in direct contact with things. And\r\nthis leads me to the second general principle which I think applies to\r\nall technical teaching for school-boys and school-girls, and that is,\r\nthat they should be led from the observation of the commonest facts to\r\ngeneral scientific truths. If I were called upon to frame a course of\r\nelementary instruction preparatory to agriculture, I am not sure that I\r\nshould attempt chemistry, or botany, or physiology or geology, as such.\r\nIt is a method fraught with the danger of spending too much time and\r\nattention on abstraction and theories, on words and notions instead of\r\nthings. The history of a bean, of a grain of wheat, of a turnip, of a\r\nsheep, of a pig, or of a cow properly treated--with the introduction of\r\nthe elements of chemistry, physiology, and so on as they come in--would\r\ngive all the elementary science which is needed for the comprehension\r\nof the processes of agriculture in a form easily assimilated by the\r\nyouthful mind, which loathes everything in the shape of long words and\r\nabstract notions, and small blame to it. I am afraid I shall not have\r\nhelped you very much, but I believe that my suggestions, rough as they\r\nare, are in the right direction.\r\n\r\n[The remaining letters of the year are of miscellaneous interest. They\r\nshow him happily established in his retreat at Eastbourne in very fair\r\nhealth, on his guard against any further repetition of his \"jubilee\r\nhonour\" in the shape of his old enemy pleurisy; unable to escape the\r\nmore insidious attacks of influenza, but well enough on the whole to be\r\nin constant good spirits.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 13, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Skelton,\r\n\r\nMany thanks to you for reminding me that there are such things as\r\n\"Summer Isles\" in the universe. The memory of them has been pretty well\r\nblotted out here for the last seven weeks. You see some people can\r\nretire to \"Hermitages\" as well as other people; and though even Argyll\r\ncum Gladstone powers of self-deception could not persuade me that the\r\nview from my window is as good as that from yours, yet I do see a fine\r\nwavy chalk down with \"cwms\" and soft turfy ridges, over which an old\r\nfellow can stride as far as his legs are good to carry him.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that I discovered that staying in London any longer meant\r\nfor me a very short life, and by no means a merry one. So I got my\r\nson-in-law to build me a cottage here, where my wife and I may go\r\ndown-hill quietly together, and \"make our sowls\" as the Irish say,\r\nsolaced by an occasional visit from children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nThe deuce of it is, that however much the weary want to be at rest the\r\nwicked won't cease from troubling. Hence the occasional skirmishes and\r\nalarms which may lead my friends to misdoubt my absolute detachment\r\nfrom sublunary affairs. Perhaps peace dwells only among the fork-tailed\r\nPetrels!\r\n\r\nI trust Mrs. Skelton and you are flourishing, and that trouble will\r\nkeep far from the hospitable doors of Braid through the New Year.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[No sooner had he settled down in his new country home, than a strange\r\npiece of good fortune, such as happens more often in a story-book than\r\nin real life, enabled him at one stroke to double his little estate, to\r\nkeep off the unwelcome approach of the speculative builder, and to give\r\nhimself scope for the newly-discovered delights of the garden. The sale\r\nof the house in Marlborough Place covered the greater part of the cost\r\nof Hodeslea; but almost on the very day on which the sale was\r\nconcluded, he became the possessor of another house at Worthing by the\r\ndeath of Mr. Anthony Rich, the well-known antiquarian. An old man,\r\nalmost alone in the world, his admiration for the great work done\r\nrecently in natural science had long since led him to devise his\r\nproperty to Darwin and Huxley, to the one his private fortune, to the\r\nother his house and its contents, notably a very interesting library.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of feeling, Huxley was greatly disinclined to part with\r\nthis house, Chapel Croft, as soon as it had come into his hands. A year\r\nearlier, he might have made it his home; but now he had settled down at\r\nEastbourne, and Chapel Croft, as it stood, was unlikely to find a\r\ntenant. Accordingly he sold it early in July, and with the proceeds\r\nbought the piece of land adjoining his house. Thus he writes to Sir J.\r\nHooker:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, May 17, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nMy estate is somewhat of a white elephant. There is about a couple of\r\nacres of ground well situated and half of it in the shape of a very\r\npretty lawn and shrubbery, but unluckily, in building the house, dear\r\nold Rich thought of his own convenience and not mine (very wrong of\r\nhim!), and I cannot conceive anybody but an old bachelor or old maid\r\nliving in it. I do not believe anybody would take it as it stands. No\r\ndoubt the site is valuable, and it would be well worth while to anybody\r\nwith plenty of cash to spare to build on to the house and make it\r\nuseful. But I neither have the cash, nor do I want the bother. However,\r\nWaller is going to look at the place for me and see what can be done.\r\nIt seems hardly decent to sell it at once; and moreover the value is\r\nlikely to increase. I suppose at present it is worth 2000 pounds, but\r\nthat is only a guess.\r\n\r\nApropos of naval portrait gallery, can you tell me if there is a\r\nportrait of old John Richardson anywhere extant? I always look upon him\r\nas the founder of my fortunes, and I want to hang him up (just over\r\nyour head) on my chimney breast. Voici! [sketch showing the position of\r\nthe pictures above the fireplace]:--\r\n\r\nBy your fruits ye shall judge them! My cold was influenza, I have been\r\nin the most preposterously weak state ever since; and at last my wife\r\nlost patience and called in the doctor, who is screwing me up with nux\r\nvomica.\r\n\r\nSound wind and limb otherwise.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And again on July 3:--]\r\n\r\nI have just been offered 2800 pounds for Anthony Rich's place and have\r\naccepted it. It is probably worth 3000 pounds, but if I were to have it\r\non my hands and sell by auction I should get no more out of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nI am greatly inclined to put some of the money into a piece of land--a\r\nNaboth's vineyard--in front of my house and turn horticulturist. I find\r\nnailing up creepers a delightful occupation.\r\n\r\n[In the same letter he describes two meetings with old friends:--]\r\n\r\nLast Friday I ran down to Hindhead to see Tyndall. He was very much\r\nbetter than I hoped to find him, after such a long and serious illness,\r\nquite bright and \"Tyndalloid\" and not aged as I feared he would\r\nbe...The local doctor happened to be there during my visit and spoke\r\nvery confidently of his speedy recovery. The leg is all right again,\r\nand he even talks of Switzerland, but I begged Mrs. Tyndall to persuade\r\nhim to keep quiet and within reach of home and skilled medical\r\nattendance.\r\n\r\nSaturday to Monday we were at Down, after six or seven years'\r\ninterruption of our wonted visits. It was very pleasant if rather sad.\r\nMrs. Darwin is wonderfully well--naturally aged--but quite bright and\r\ncheerful as usual. Old Parslow turned up on Sunday, just eighty, but\r\nstill fairly hale.

I have never been so set up before, and begin to\r\nthink that fathers (like port) must improve in quality with age. (No\r\nirreverent jokes about their getting crusty, Miss.)\r\n\r\nJulian and Joyce taken together may perhaps give a faint idea of my\r\nperfections as a child. I have not only a distinct recollection of\r\nbeing noticed on the score of my good looks, but my mother used to\r\nremind me painfully of them in my later years, looking at me mournfully\r\nand saying, \"And you were such a pretty boy!\"\r\n\r\n[Much as he would have liked to visit the Maloja again this year, the\r\nstate of his wife's health forbade such a long journey. He writes just\r\nafter his attack of influenza to Sir M. Foster, who had been suffering\r\nin the same way:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, May 12, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI was very glad to hear from you. Pray don't get attempting to do\r\nanything before you are\r\nset up again.\r\n\r\nI am in a ridiculous state of weakness, and bless my stars that I have\r\nnothing to do. I find it troublesome to do even that.\r\n\r\nI wish ballooning had advanced so far as to take people to Maloja, for\r\nI do not think my wife ought to undertake such a journey, and yet I\r\nbelieve the high air would do us both more good than anything else....\r\n\r\nThe University of London scheme appears to be coming to grief, as I\r\nnever doubted it would.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[So instead of going abroad, he stayed in Eastbourne till the end of\r\nAugust, receiving a short visit from his old friend Jowett, who, though\r\nsadly enfeebled by age, still persisted in travelling by himself, and a\r\nlonger visit from his elder son and his family. But from September 11\r\nto the 26th he and his wife made a trip through the west country,\r\nstarting from Salisbury, which had so delighted him the year before,\r\nand proceeding by way of the Wye valley, which they had not visited\r\nsince their honeymoon, to Llangollen. The first stage on the return\r\njourney was Chester, whence they made pious pilgrimage to the cradle of\r\nhis name, Old Huxley Hall, some nine miles from Chester. Incorporated\r\nwith a modern farm-house, and forming the present kitchen, are some\r\nsolid stone walls, part of the old manor-house, now no longer belonging\r\nto any one of the name. From here they went to Coventry, where he had\r\nlived as a boy, and found the house which his father had occupied still\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nA letter to an old pupil contains reflections upon the years of work to\r\nwhich he had devoted so much of his energies.]\r\n\r\nTo Professor T. Jeffery Parker, Otago.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, August 11, 1891.\r\n\r\nMy dear Parker,\r\n\r\nIt is a long time since your letter reached me, but I was so unwise as\r\nto put off answering it until the book arrived and I had read it. The\r\nbook did not reach me for a long time, and what with one thing and\r\nanother I have but just finished it. I assure you I am very proud of\r\nhaving my name connected with such a thorough piece of work, no less\r\nthan touched by the kindness of the dedication.\r\n\r\nLooking back from the aged point of view, the life which cost so much\r\nwear and tear in the living seems to have effected very little, and it\r\nis cheering to be reminded that one has been of some use.\r\n\r\nSome years of continued ill-health, involving constant travelling about\r\nin search of better conditions than London affords, and long periods of\r\nprostration, have driven me quite out of touch with science. And indeed\r\nexcept for a certain toughness of constitution I should have been\r\ndriven out of touch with terrestrial things altogether.\r\n\r\nIt is almost indecent in a man at my time of life who has had two\r\nattacks of pleurisy, followed by a dilated heart, to be not only above\r\nground but fairly vigorous again. However, I am obliged to mind my P's\r\nand Q's; avoid everything like hard work, and live in good air.\r\n\r\nThe last condition we have achieved by setting up a house close to the\r\ndowns here; and I begin to think with Candide that \"cultivons notre\r\njardin\" comprises the whole duty of man.\r\n\r\nI was just out of the way of hearing anything about the University\r\nCollege chair; and indeed, beyond attending the Council of the school\r\nwhen necessary, and meetings of Trustees of the British Museum, I\r\nrarely go to London.\r\n\r\nI have had my innings, and it is now for the younger generation to have\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes, ever yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[As for being no longer in touch with the world of science, he says the\r\nsame thing in a note to Sir M.

H. de Varigny, to whom the\r\nfollowing letters are addressed.]\r\n\r\nTo H. De Varigny.\r\n\r\nMay 17, 1891.\r\n\r\nI am writing to my publishers to send you \"Lay Sermons\", \"Critiques\",\r\n\"Science and Culture\", and \"American Addresses\", pray accept them in\r\nexpression of my thanks for the pains you are taking about the\r\ntranslation. \"Man's Place in Nature\" has been out of print for years,\r\nso I cannot supply it.\r\n\r\nI am quite conscious that the condensed and idiomatic English into\r\nwhich I always try to put my thoughts must present many difficulties to\r\na translator. But a friend of mine who is a much better French scholar\r\nthan I am, and who looked over two or three of the essays, told me he\r\nthought you had been remarkably successful.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that I have a great love and respect for my native tongue,\r\nand take great pains to use it properly. Sometimes I write essays\r\nhalf-a-dozen times before I can get them into the proper shape; and I\r\nbelieve I become more fastidious as I grow older.\r\n\r\nNovember 25, 1891.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you have found your task pleasant, for I am afraid it\r\nmust have cost you a good deal of trouble to put my ideas into the\r\nexcellent French dress with which you have provided them. It fits so\r\nwell that I feel almost as if I might be a candidate for a seat among\r\nthe immortal forty!\r\n\r\nAs to the new volume, you shall have the refusal of it if you care to\r\nhave it. But I have my doubts about its acceptability to a French\r\npublic which I imagine knows little about Bibliolatry and the ways of\r\nProtestant clericalism, and cares less.\r\n\r\nThese essays represent a controversy which has been going on for five\r\nor six years about Genesis, the deluge, the miracle of the herd of\r\nswine, and the miraculous generally, between Gladstone, the\r\necclesiastical principal of King's College, various bishops, the writer\r\nof \"Lux Mundi\", that spoilt Scotch minister the Duke of Argyll, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nMy object has been to stir up my countrymen to think about these\r\nthings; and the only use of controversy is that it appeals to their\r\nlove of fighting, and secures their attention.\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to have your book on \"Experimental Evolution\". I\r\ninsisted on the necessity of obtaining experimental proof of the\r\npossibility of obtaining virtually infertile breeds from a common stock\r\nin 1860 (in one of the essays you have translated). Mr. Tegetmeier made\r\na number of experiments with pigeons some years ago, but could obtain\r\nnot the least approximation to infertility.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, I told Darwin this was the weak point of his case from\r\nthe point of view of scientific logic. But, in this matter, we are just\r\nwhere we were thirty years ago, and I am very glad you are going to\r\ncall attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nSending a copy of the translation soon after to Sir J. Hooker, he\r\nwrites:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 11, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nWe have been in the middle of snow for the last four days. I shall not\r\nventure to London, and if you deserve the family title of the\r\n\"judicious,\" I don't think you will either.\r\n\r\nI send you by this post a volume of the French translation of a\r\ncollection of my essays about Darwinism and Evolution, 1860-76, for\r\nwhich I have written a brief preface. I was really proud of myself when\r\nI discovered on re-reading them that I had nothing to alter.\r\n\r\nWhat times those days were! Fuimus.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The same subject of experimental evolution reappears in a letter to\r\nProfessor Romanes of April 29. A project was on foot for founding an\r\ninstitution in which experiments bearing upon the Darwinian theory\r\ncould be carried out. After congratulating Professor Romanes upon his\r\nrecent election to the Athenaeum Club, he proceeds:--]\r\n\r\nIn a review of Darwin's \"Origin\" published in the \"Westminster\" for\r\n1860 (\"Lay Sermons\" pages 323-24), you will see that I insisted on the\r\nlogical incompleteness of the theory so long as it was not backed by\r\nexperimental proof that the cause assumed was competent to produce all\r\nthe effects required. (See also \"Lectures to Working Men\" 1863 pages\r\n146 and 147.) In fact, Darwin used to reproach me sometimes for my\r\npertinacious insistence on the need of experimental verification.\r\n\r\nBut I hope you are going to choose some other title than \"Institut\r\ntransformiste,\" which implies that the Institute is pledged to a\r\nforegone conclusion, that it is a workshop devoted to the production of\r\na particular kind of article. Moreover, I should say that as a matter\r\nof prudence, you had better keep clear of the word \"experimental.\"\r\nWould not \"Biological Observatory\" serve the turn? Of course it does\r\nnot exclude experiment any more than \"Astronomical Observatory\"\r\nexcludes spectrum analysis.\r\n\r\nPlease think over this. My objection to \"Transformist\" is very strong.\r\n\r\n[In August his youngest daughter wrote to him to find out the nature of\r\nvarious \"objects of the seashore\" which she had found on the beach in\r\nSouth Wales.

Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.9.\r\n\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nThe revival of part of the former controversy which he had had with Mr.\r\nGladstone upon the story of creation, made a warlike beginning of an\r\notherwise very peaceful year. Since the middle of December a great\r\ncorrespondence had been going on in the \"Times\", consequent upon the\r\nfamous manifesto of the thirty-eight Anglican clergy touching the\r\nquestion of inspiration and the infallibility of the Bible. Criticism,\r\nwhether \"higher\" or otherwise, defended on the one side, was\r\nunsparingly denounced on the other. After about a month of this\r\ncorrespondence, Huxley's name was mentioned as one of these critics;\r\nwhereupon he was attacked by one of the disputants for \"misleading the\r\npublic\" by his assertion in the original controversy that while\r\nreptiles appear in the geological record before birds, Genesis affirms\r\nthe contrary; the critic declaring that the word for \"creeping things\"\r\n(rehmes) created on the sixth day, does not refer to reptiles, which\r\nare covered by the \"moving creatures\" (shehretz) used of the first\r\nappearance of animal life.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to see how, in his reply, Huxley took care to keep\r\nthe main points at issue separate from the subordinate and unimportant\r\nones. His answer is broken up into four letters. The first (\"Times\"\r\nJanuary 26) rehearses the original issue between himself and Mr.\r\nGladstone; wherein both sides agreed that the creation of the sixth day\r\nincluded reptiles, so that, formally at least, his position was secure,\r\nthough there was also a broader ground of difference to be considered.\r\nBefore proceeding further, he asks his critic whether he admits the\r\nexistence of the contradiction involved, and if not, to state his\r\nreasons therefor. These reasons were again given on February 1 as the\r\nnew interpretation of the two Hebrew words already referred to, an\r\ninterpretation, by the way, which makes the same word stand both for\r\n\"the vast and various population of the waters\" and \"for such land\r\nanimals as mice, weasels, and lizards, great and small.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 3 appeared the second letter, in which, setting aside the\r\nparticular form which his argument against Mr. Gladstone had taken, he\r\ndescribed the broad differences between the teachings of Genesis and\r\nthe teachings of evolution. He left the minor details as to the\r\ninterpretation of the words in dispute, which did not really affect the\r\nmain argument, to be dealt with in the next letter of February 4. It\r\nwas a question with which he had long been familiar, as twenty years\r\nbefore he had, at Dr. Kalisch's request, gone over the proofs of his\r\n\"Commentary on Leviticus\".\r\n\r\nThe letter of February 3 is as follows:--]\r\n\r\nWhile desirous to waste neither your space nor my own time upon mere\r\nmisrepresentations of what I have said elsewhere about the relations\r\nbetween modern science and the so-called \"Mosaic\" cosmogony, it seems\r\nneedful that I should ask for the opportunity of stating the case once\r\nmore, as briefly and fairly as I can.\r\n\r\nI conceive the first chapter of Genesis to teach--(1) that the species\r\nof plants and animals owe their origin to supernatural acts of\r\ncreation; (2) that these acts took place at such times and in such a\r\nmanner that all the plants were created first, all the aquatic and\r\naerial animals (notably birds) next, and all terrestrial animals last.\r\nI am not aware that any Hebrew scholar denies that these propositions\r\nagree with the natural sense of the text. Sixty years ago I was taught,\r\nas most people were then taught, that they are guaranteed by Divine\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in my judgment, natural science teaches no less\r\ndistinctly--(1) that the species of animals and plants have originated\r\nby a process of natural evolution; (2) that this process has taken\r\nplace in such a manner that the species of animals and plants,\r\nrespectively, have come into existence one after another throughout the\r\nwhole period since they began to exist on the earth; that the species\r\nof plants and animals known to us are as a whole, neither older nor\r\nyounger the one than the other.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good of aquatic and aerial species, as a whole, compared\r\nwith terrestrial species; but birds appear in the geological record\r\nlater than terrestrial reptiles, and there is every reason to believe\r\nthat they were evolved from the latter.\r\n\r\nUntil it is shown that the first two propositions are not contained in\r\nthe first chapter of Genesis, and that the second pair are not\r\njustified by the present condition of our knowledge, I must continue to\r\nmaintain that natural science and the \"Mosaic\" account of the origin of\r\nanimals and plants are in irreconcilable antagonism.\r\n\r\nAs I greatly desire that this broad issue should not be obscured by the\r\ndiscussion of minor points, I propose to defer what I may have to say\r\nabout the great \"shehretz\" and \"rehmes\" question till to-morrow.\r\n\r\n[On February 11 he wrote once more, again taking certain broader\r\naspects of the problem presented by the first chapter of Genesis. He\r\nexpressed his belief, as he had expressed it in 1869, that theism is\r\nnot logically antagonistic to evolution. If, he continues, the account\r\nin Genesis, as Philo of Alexandria held, is only a poem or allegory,\r\nwhere is the proof that any one non-natural interpretation is the right\r\none? and he concludes by pointing out the difficulties in the way of\r\nthose who, like the famous thirty-eight, assert the infallibility of\r\nthe Bible as guaranteed by the infallibility of the Church.\r\n\r\nApart from letters and occasional controversy, he published this year\r\nonly one magazine article and a single volume of collected essays,\r\nthough he was busy preparing the Romanes Lecture for 1893, the more so\r\nbecause there was some chance that Mr. Gladstone would be unable to\r\ndeliver the first of the lectures in 1892, and Huxley had promised to\r\nbe ready to take his place if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe volume (called \"Controverted Questions\") which appeared in 1892,\r\nwas a collection of the essays of the last few years, mainly\r\ncontroversial, or as he playfully called them, \"endeavours to defend a\r\ncherished cause,\" dealing with agnosticism and the demonological and\r\nmiraculous element in Christianity. That they were controversial in\r\ntone no one lamented more than himself; and as in the letter to M. de\r\nVarigny, of November 25, 1891, so here in the prologue he apologises\r\nfor the fact.]\r\n\r\nThis prologue,--of which he writes to a friend], \"It cost me more time\r\nand pains than any equal number of pages I have ever written,\"--[was\r\ndesigned to indicate the main question, various aspects of which are\r\ndealt with by these seemingly disconnected essays.]\r\n\r\nThe historical evolution of humanity [he writes], which is generally,\r\nand I venture to think not unreasonably, regarded as progress, has\r\nbeen, and is being, accompanied by a co-ordinate elimination of the\r\nsupernatural from its originally large occupation of men's thought. The\r\nquestion--How far is this process to go? is, in my apprehension, the\r\ncontroverted question of our time.\r\n\r\nThis movement, marked by the claim for the freedom of private judgment,\r\nwhich first came to its fulness in the Renascence, is here sketched\r\nout, rising or sinking by turns under the pressure of social and\r\npolitical vicissitudes, from Wiclif's earliest proposal to reduce the\r\nSupernaturalism of Christianity within the limits sanctioned by the\r\nScriptures, down to the manifesto in the previous year of the\r\nthirty-eight Anglican divines in defence of biblical infallibility,\r\nwhich practically ends in an appeal to the very principle they reject.\r\n\r\nBut he does not content himself with pointing out the destructive\r\neffects of criticism upon the evidence in favour of a\r\n\"supernature\"--\"The present incarnation of the spirit of the\r\nRenascence,\" he writes, \"differs from its predecessor in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, in that it builds up, as well as pulls down. That of which it\r\nhas laid the foundation, of which it is already raising the\r\nsuperstructure, is the doctrine of evolution,\" a doctrine that \"is no\r\nspeculation, but a generalisation of certain facts, which may be\r\nobserved by any one who will take the necessary trouble.\" And in a\r\nshort dozen pages he sketches out that \"common body of established\r\ntruths\" to which it is his confident belief that \"all future\r\nphilosophical and theological speculations will have to accommodate\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need to recapitulate these; they may be read in \"Science\r\nand Christian Tradition\", the fifth volume of the \"Collected Essays\";\r\nbut it is worth noticing that in conclusion, after rejecting \"a great\r\nmany supernaturalistic theories and legends which have no better\r\nfoundations than those of heathenism,\" he declares himself as far from\r\nwishing to \"throw the Bible aside as so much waste paper\" as he was at\r\nthe establishment of the School Board in 1870. As English literature,\r\nas world-old history, as moral teaching, as the Magna Charta of the\r\npoor and of the oppressed, the most democratic book in the world, he\r\ncould not spare it.] \"I do not say,\" [he adds], \"that even the highest\r\nbiblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs no supplement. But I do\r\nbelieve that the human race is not yet, possibly may never be, in a\r\nposition to dispense with it.\"\r\n\r\n[It was this volume that led to the writing of the magazine article\r\nreferred to above. The republication in it of the \"Agnosticism,\"\r\noriginally written in reply to an article of Mr. Frederic Harrison's,\r\ninduced the latter to disclaim in the \"Fortnightly Review\" the intimate\r\nconnection assumed to exist between his views and the system of\r\nPositivism detailed by Comte, and at the same time to offer the olive\r\nbranch to his former opponent. But while gratefully accepting the\r\ngoodwill implied in the offer, Huxley still declared himself unable to]\r\n\"give his assent to a single doctrine which is the peculiar property of\r\nPositivism, old or new,\" [nor to agree with Mr. Harrison when he\r\nwanted:--]\r\n\r\nto persuade us that agnosticism is only the Court of the Gentiles of\r\nthe Positivist temple; and that those who profess ignorance about the\r\nproper solution of certain speculative problems ought to call\r\nthemselves Positivists of the Gate, if it happens that they also take a\r\nlively interest in social and political questions.\r\n\r\n[This essay, \"An Apologetic Irenicon,\" contains more than one passage\r\nof personal interest, which are the more worth quoting here, as the\r\nessay has not been republished. It was to have been included in a tenth\r\nvolume of collected Essays, along with a number of others which he\r\nprojected, but never wrote.\r\n\r\nThus, begging the Positivists not to regard him as a rival or\r\ncompetitor in the business of instructing the human race, he says:--]\r\n\r\nI aspire to no such elevated and difficult situation. I declare myself\r\nnot only undesirous of it, but deeply conscious of a constitutional\r\nunfitness for it. Age and hygienic necessities bind me to a somewhat\r\nanchoritic life in pure air, with abundant leisure to meditate upon the\r\nwisdom of Candide's sage aphorism, \"Cultivons notre jardin\"--especially\r\nif the term garden may be taken broadly and applied to the stony and\r\nweed-grown ground within my skull, as well as to a few perches of more\r\npromising chalk down outside it. In addition to these effectual bars to\r\nany of the ambitious pretensions ascribed to me, there is another: of\r\nall possible positions that of master of a school, or leader of a sect,\r\nor chief of a party, appears to me to be the most undesirable; in fact,\r\nthe average British matron cannot look upon followers with a more evil\r\neye than I do. Such acquaintance with the history of thought as I\r\npossess, has taught me to regard schools, parties, and sects, as\r\narrangements, the usual effect of which is to perpetuate all that is\r\nworst and feeblest in the master's, leader's, or founder's work; or\r\nelse, as in some cases, to upset it altogether; as a sort of hydrants\r\nfor extinguishing the fire of genius, and for stifling the flame of\r\nhigh aspirations, the kindling of which has been the chief, perhaps the\r\nonly, merit of the protagonist of the movement. I have always been, am,\r\nand propose to remain a mere scholar. All that I have ever proposed to\r\nmyself is to say, this and this have I learned; thus and thus have I\r\nlearned it: go thou and learn better; but do not thrust on my shoulders\r\nthe responsibility for your own laziness if you elect to take, on my\r\nauthority, conclusions, the value of which you ought to have tested for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\n[Again, replying to the reproach that all his public utterances had\r\nbeen of a negative character, that the great problems of human life had\r\nbeen entirely left out of his purview, he defends once more the work of\r\nthe man who clears the ground for the builders to come after him:--]\r\n\r\nThere is endless backwoodsman's work yet to be done, If \"those also\r\nserve who only stand and wait,\" still more do those who sweep and\r\ncleanse; and if any man elect to give his strength to the weeder's and\r\nscavenger's occupation, I remain of the opinion that his service should\r\nbe counted acceptable, and that no one has a right to ask more of him\r\nthan faithful performance of the duties he has undertaken. I venture to\r\ncount it an improbable suggestion that any such person--a man, let us\r\nsay, who has well-nigh reached his threescore years and ten, and has\r\ngraduated in all the faculties of human relationships; who has taken\r\nhis share in all the deep joys and deeper anxieties which cling about\r\nthem; who has felt the burden of young lives entrusted to his care, and\r\nhas stood alone with his dead before the abyss of the eternal--has\r\nnever had a thought beyond negative criticism. It seems to me\r\nincredible that such an one can have done his day's work, always with a\r\nlight heart, with no sense of responsibility, no terror of that which\r\nmay appear when the factitious veil of Isis--the thick web of fiction\r\nman has woven round nature--is stripped off.\r\n\r\n[Challenged to state his \"mental bias, pro or con,\" with regard to such\r\nmatters as Creation, Providence, etc., he reiterates his words written\r\nthirty-two years before:--]\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1860 I wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"The doctrine of special creation owes its existence very largely to\r\nthe supposed necessity of making science accord with the Hebrew\r\ncosmogony\"; and that the hypothesis of special creation is, in my\r\njudgment, a \"mere specious mask for our ignorance.\" Not content with\r\nnegation, I said:--\r\n\r\n\"Harmonious order governing eternally continuous progress; the web and\r\nwoof of matter and force interweaving by slow degrees, without a broken\r\nthread, that veil which lies between us and the infinite; that universe\r\nwhich alone we know, or can know; such is the picture which science\r\ndraws of the world.\"\r\n\r\nEvery reader of Goethe will know that the second is little more than a\r\nparaphrase of the well-known utterance of the \"Zeitgeist\" in \"Faust\",\r\nwhich surely is something more than a mere negation of the clumsy\r\nanthropomorphism of special creation.\r\n\r\nFollows a query about \"Providence,\" my answer to which must depend upon\r\nwhat my questioner means by that substantive, whether alone, or\r\nqualified by the adjective \"moral.\"\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of a Providence is to be taken as the expression, in a\r\nway \"to be understanded of the people,\" of the total exclusion of\r\nchance from a place even in the most insignificant corner of Nature, if\r\nit means the strong conviction that the cosmic process is rational, and\r\nthe faith that, throughout all duration, unbroken order has reigned in\r\nthe universe, I not only accept it, but I am disposed to think it the\r\nmost important of all truths. As it is of more consequence for a\r\ncitizen to know the law than to be personally acquainted with the\r\nfeatures of those who will surely carry it into effect, so this very\r\npositive doctrine of Providence, in the sense defined, seems to me far\r\nmore important than all the theorems of speculative theology. If,\r\nfurther, the doctrine is held to imply that, in some indefinitely\r\nremote past aeon, the cosmic process was set going by some entity\r\npossessed of intelligence and foresight, similar to our own in kind,\r\nhowever superior in degree, if, consequently, it is held that every\r\nevent, not merely in our planetary speck, but in untold millions of\r\nother worlds, was foreknown before these worlds were, scientific\r\nthought, so far as I know anything about it, has nothing to say against\r\nthat hypothesis. It is, in fact, an anthropomorphic rendering of the\r\ndoctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\nIt may be so, but the evidence accessible to us is, to my mind, wholly\r\ninsufficient to warrant either a positive or a negative conclusion.\r\n\r\n[He remarks in passing upon the entire exclusion of \"special\"\r\nprovidences by this conception of a universal \"Providence.\" As for\r\n\"moral\" providence:--]\r\n\r\nSo far as mankind has acquired the conviction that the observance of\r\ncertain rules of conduct is essential to the maintenance of social\r\nexistence, it may be proper to say that \"Providence,\" operating through\r\nmen, has generated morality. Within the limits of a fraction of a\r\nfraction of the living world, therefore, there is a \"moral\" providence.\r\nThrough this small plot of an infinitesimal fragment of the universe\r\nthere runs a \"stream of tendency towards righteousness.\" But outside\r\nthe very rudimentary germ of a garden of Eden, thus watered, I am\r\nunable to discover any \"moral\" purpose, or anything but a stream of\r\npurpose towards the consummation of the cosmic process, chiefly by\r\nmeans of the struggle for existence, which is no more righteous or\r\nunrighteous than the operation of any other mechanism.\r\n\r\n[This, of course, is the underlying principle of the Romanes Lecture,\r\nupon which he was still at work. It is more specifically expressed in\r\nthe succeeding paragraph:--]\r\n\r\nI hear much of the \"ethics of evolution.\" I apprehend that, in the\r\nbroadest sense of the term \"evolution,\" there neither is, nor can be,\r\nany such thing. The notion that the doctrine of evolution can furnish a\r\nfoundation for morals seems to me to be an illusion which has arisen\r\nfrom the unfortunate ambiguity of the term \"fittest\" in the formula,\r\n\"survival of the fittest.\" We commonly use \"fittest\" in a good sense,\r\nwith an understood connotation of \"best\"; and \"best\" we are apt to take\r\nin its ethical sense. But the \"fittest\" which survives in the struggle\r\nfor existence may be, and often is, the ethically worst.\r\n\r\n[Another paragraph explains the sense in which he used to say that the\r\nRomanes Lecture was a very orthodox discourse on the text, \"Satan, the\r\nPrince of this world\":--]\r\n\r\nIt is the secret of the superiority of the best theological teachers to\r\nthe majority of their opponents that they substantially recognise these\r\nrealities of things, however strange the forms in which they clothe\r\ntheir conceptions. The doctrines of predestination, of original sin, of\r\nthe innate depravity of man and the evil fate of the greater part of\r\nthe race, of the primacy of Satan in this world, of the essential\r\nvileness of matter, of a malevolent Demiurgus subordinate to a\r\nbenevolent Almighty, who has only lately revealed himself, faulty as\r\nthey are, appear to me to be vastly nearer the truth than the \"liberal\"\r\npopular illusions that babies are all born good, and that the example\r\nof a corrupt society is responsible for their failure to remain so;\r\nthat it is given to everybody to reach the ethical ideal if he will\r\nonly try; that all partial evil is universal good, and other optimistic\r\nfigments, such as that which represents \"Providence\" under the guise of\r\na paternal philanthropist, and bids us believe that everything will\r\ncome right (according to our notions) at last.\r\n\r\nAs to \"Immortality\" again [he refers his critic to his book on \"Hume\"].\r\nI do not think I need return to \"subjective\" immortality, but it may be\r\nwell to add that I am a very strong believer in the punishment of\r\ncertain kinds of actions, not only in the present, but in all the\r\nfuture a man can have, be it long or short. Therefore in hell, for I\r\nsuppose that all men with a clear sense of right and wrong (and I am\r\nnot sure that any others deserve such punishment) have now and then\r\n\"descended into hell\" and stopped there quite long enough to know what\r\ninfinite punishment means. And if a genuine, not merely subjective,\r\nimmortality awaits us, I conceive that, without some such change as\r\nthat depicted in the fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the\r\nCorinthians, immortality must be eternal misery. The fate of Swift's\r\nStruldbrugs seems to me not more horrible than that of a mind\r\nimprisoned for ever within the flammantia moenia of inextinguishable\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\nFurther, it may be well to remember that the highest level of moral\r\naspiration recorded in history was reached by a few ancient\r\nJews--Micah, Isaiah, and the rest--who took no count whatever of what\r\nmight or might not happen to them after death. It is not obvious to me\r\nwhy the same point should not by and by be reached by the Gentiles.\r\n\r\n[He admits that the generality of mankind will not be satisfied to be\r\ntold that there are some topics about which we know nothing now, and do\r\nnot seem likely ever to be able to know more; and, consequently, that\r\nin the long-run the world will turn to those who profess to have\r\nconclusions:--]\r\n\r\nAnd that is the pity of it. As in the past, so, I fear, through a very\r\nlong future, the multitude will continue to turn to those who are ready\r\nto feed it with the viands its soul lusteth after; who will offer\r\nmental peace where there is no peace, and lap it in the luxury of\r\npleasant delusions.\r\n\r\nTo missionaries of the Neo-Positivist, as to those of other professed\r\nsolutions of insoluble mysteries, whose souls are bound up in the\r\nsuccess of their sectarian propaganda, no doubt, it must be very\r\ndisheartening if the \"world,\" for whose assent and approbation they\r\nsue, stops its ears and turns its back upon them. But what does it\r\nsignify to any one who does not happen to be a missionary of any sect,\r\nphilosophical or religious, and who, if he were, would have no sermon\r\nto preach except from the text with which Descartes, to go no further\r\nback, furnished us two centuries since? I am very sorry if people will\r\nnot listen to those who rehearse before them the best lessons they have\r\nbeen able to learn, but that is their business, not mine. Belief in\r\nmajorities is not rooted in my breast, and if all the world were\r\nagainst me the fact might warn me to revise and criticise my opinions,\r\nbut would not in itself supply a ghost of a reason for forsaking them.\r\nFor myself I say deliberately, it is better to have a millstone tied\r\nround the neck and be thrown into the sea than to share the enterprises\r\nof those to whom the world has turned, and will turn, because they\r\nminister to its weaknesses and cover up the awful realities which it\r\nshudders to look at.\r\n\r\n[A letter to Mr. N.P. Clayton also discusses the basis of morality.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 5, 1892.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI well remember the interview to which you refer, and I should have\r\nreplied to your letter sooner, but during the last few weeks I have\r\nbeen very busy.\r\n\r\nMoral duty consists in the observance of those rules of conduct which\r\ncontribute to the welfare of society, and by implication, of the\r\nindividuals who compose it.\r\n\r\nThe end of society is peace and mutual protection, so that the\r\nindividual may reach the fullest and highest life attainable by man.\r\nThe rules of conduct by which this end is to be attained are\r\ndiscoverable--like the other so-called laws of Nature--by observation\r\nand experiment, and only in that way.\r\n\r\nSome thousands of years of such experience have led to the\r\ngeneralisations, that stealing and murder, for example, are\r\ninconsistent with the ends of society. There is no more doubt that they\r\nare so than that unsupported stones tend to fall. The man who steals or\r\nmurders, breaks his implied contract with society, and forfeits all\r\nprotection. He becomes an outlaw, to be dealt with as any other feral\r\ncreature. Criminal law indicates the ways which have proved most\r\nconvenient for dealing with him.\r\n\r\nAll this would be true if men had no \"moral sense\" at all, just as\r\nthere are rules of perspective which must be strictly observed by a\r\ndraughtsman, and are quite independent of his having any artistic sense.\r\n\r\nThe moral sense is a very complex affair--dependent in part upon\r\nassociations of pleasure and pain, approbation and disapprobation\r\nformed by education in early youth, but in part also on an innate sense\r\nof moral beauty and ugliness (how originated need not be discussed),\r\nwhich is possessed by some people in great strength, while some are\r\ntotally devoid of it--just as some children draw, or are enchanted by\r\nmusic while mere infants, while others do not know \"Cherry Ripe\" from\r\n\"Rule Britannia,\" nor can represent the form of the simplest thing to\r\nthe end of their lives.\r\n\r\nNow for this last sort of people there is no reason why they should\r\ndischarge any moral duty, except from fear of punishment in all its\r\ngrades, from mere disapprobation to hanging, and the duty of society is\r\nto see that they live under wholesome fear of such punishment short,\r\nsharp, and decisive.\r\n\r\nFor the people with a keen innate sense of moral beauty there is no\r\nneed of any other motive. What they want is knowledge of the things\r\nthey may do and must leave undone, if the welfare of society is to be\r\nattained. Good people so often forget this that some of them\r\noccasionally require hanging almost as much as the bad.\r\n\r\nIf you ask why the moral inner sense is to be (under due limitations)\r\nobeyed; why the few who are steered by it move the mass in whom it is\r\nweak? I can only reply by putting another question--Why do the few in\r\nwhom the sense of beauty is strong--Shakespere, Raffaele, Beethoven,\r\ncarry the less endowed multitude away? But they do, and always will.\r\nPeople who overlook that fact attend neither to history nor to what\r\ngoes on about them.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin was a shrewd, excellent, kindly man. I have a great\r\nrespect for him. The force of genial common-sense respectability could\r\nno further go. George Fox was the very antipodes of all this, and yet\r\none understands how he came to move the world of his day, and Franklin\r\ndid not.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we can all fulfil the moral law, I should say hardly any\r\nof us. Some of us are utterly incapable of fulfilling its plainest\r\ndictates. As there are men born physically cripples, and intellectually\r\nidiots, so there are some who are moral cripples and idiots, and can be\r\nkept straight not even by punishment. For these people there is nothing\r\nbut shutting up, or extirpation.\r\n\r\nI am, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The peaceful aspect of the \"Irenicon\" seems to have veiled to most\r\nreaders the unbroken nature of his defence, and he writes to his\r\nson-in-law, the Hon. John Collier, suggesting an alteration in the\r\ntitle of the essay:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 8, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jack,\r\n\r\nIt is delightful to find a reader who \"twigs\" every point as acutely as\r\nyour brother has done. I told somebody--was it you?--I rather wished\r\nthe printer would substitute o for e in Irenicon. So far as I have seen\r\nany notices, the British critic (what a dull ass he is) appears to have\r\nbeen seriously struck by my sweetness of temper.\r\n\r\nI sent you the article yesterday, so you will judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nWith love, ever yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nYou should see the place I am claiming for Art in the University. I do\r\nbelieve something will grow out of my plan, which has made all the dry\r\nbones rattle. It is coming on for discussion in the Senate, and I shall\r\nbe coming to you to have my wounds dressed after the fight. Don't know\r\nthe day yet.\r\n\r\n[This allusion to the place of Art in the University refers to the\r\nproposed reorganisation of the London University.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1887 the question of establishing a Teaching University\r\nfor London had become more and more pressing. London contained many\r\nisolated teaching bodies of various kinds--University College, King's\r\nCollege, the Royal College of Science, the Medical Schools, Bedford\r\nCollege, and so forth, while the London University was only an\r\nexamining body. Clearly these scattered bodies needed organising; the\r\neducational forces of the metropolis were disintegrated; much\r\nteaching--and this was especially true of the medical schools--that\r\ncould have been better done and better paid in a single institution,\r\nwas split up among several, none of which, perhaps, could offer\r\nsufficient inducement to keep the best men permanently.\r\n\r\nThe most burning question was, whether these bodies should be united\r\ninto a new university, with power to grant degrees of its own, or\r\nshould combine with the existing University of London, so that the\r\nlatter would become a teaching as well as an examining body. And if so,\r\nthere was the additional question as to the form which this combination\r\nshould take--whether federation, for example, or absorption.\r\n\r\nThe whole question had been referred to a Royal Commission by the\r\nGovernment of Lord Salisbury. The results were seen in the charter for\r\na Gresham University, embodying the former alternative, and in the\r\nintroduction into Parliament of a Bill to carry this scheme into\r\neffect. But this action had only been promoted by some of the bodies\r\ninterested, and was strongly opposed by other bodies, as well as by\r\nmany teachers who were interested in university reform.\r\n\r\nThus at the end of February, Huxley was invited, as a Governor of\r\nUniversity College, to sign a protest against the provisions of the\r\nCharter for a Teaching University then before Parliament, especially in\r\nso far as it was proposed to establish a second examining body in\r\nLondon. The signatories also begged the Government to grant further\r\ninquiry before legislating on the subject\r\n\r\nThe protest, which received over 100 signatures of weight, contributed\r\nsomething towards the rejection of the Bill in the House of Commons. It\r\nbecame possible to hope that there might be established in London a\r\nUniversity which should be something more than a mere collection of\r\nteachers, having as their only bond of union the preparation of\r\nstudents for a common examination. It was proposed to form an\r\nassociation to assist in the promotion of a teaching university for the\r\nmetropolis; but the first draft of a scheme to reconcile the\r\ncomplication of interests and ideals involved led Huxley to express\r\nhimself as follows:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 27, 1892.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Weldon [Then at University College, London; now Linacre\r\nProfessor of Physiology at Oxford.],\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have kept you waiting so long for an answer to your\r\nletter of the 17th: but your proposal required a good deal of\r\nconsideration, and I have had a variety of distractions.\r\n\r\nSo long as I am a member of the Senate of the University of London, I\r\ndo not think I can with propriety join any Association which proposes\r\nto meddle with it. Moreover, though I have a good deal of sympathy with\r\nthe ends of the Association, I have my doubts about many propositions\r\nset forth in your draft.\r\n\r\nI took part in the discussions preliminary to Lord Justice Fry's\r\nscheme, and I was so convinced that that scheme would be wrecked amidst\r\nthe complication of interests and ideals that claimed consideration,\r\nthat I gave up attending to it. In fact, living so much out of the\r\nworld now, and being sadly deaf, I am really unfit to intervene in\r\nbusiness of this kind.\r\n\r\nWorse still, I am conscious that my own ideal is, for the present at\r\nany rate, hopelessly impracticable. I should cut away medicine, law,\r\nand theology as technical specialities in charge of corporations which\r\nmight be left to settle (in the case of medicine, in accordance with\r\nthe State) the terms on which they grant degrees.\r\n\r\nThe university or universities should be learning and teaching bodies\r\ndevoted to art (literary and other), history, philosophy, and science,\r\nwhere any one who wanted to learn all that is known about these matters\r\nshould find people who could teach him and put him in the way of\r\nlearning for himself.\r\n\r\nThat is what the world will want one day or other, as a supplement to\r\nall manner of high schools and technical institution in which young\r\npeople get decently educated and learn to earn their bread--such as our\r\npresent universities.\r\n\r\nIt will be a place for men to get knowledge; and not for boys and\r\nadolescents to get degrees.\r\n\r\nI wish I could get the younger men like yourself to see that this is\r\nthe goal which they may reach, and in the meanwhile to take care that\r\nno such Philistine compromise as is possible at present, becomes too\r\nstrong to survive a sharp shake.\r\n\r\nI am, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He sketches his ideal of a modern university, and especially of its\r\nrelation to the Medical Schools, in a letter to Professor Ray Lankester\r\nof April 11:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, April 11, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lankester,\r\n\r\nWe have been having ten days of sunshine, and I have been\r\ncorrespondingly lazy, especially about letter-writing. This, however,\r\nis my notion; that unless people clearly understand that the university\r\nof the future is to be a very different thing from the university of\r\nthe past, they had better put off meddling for another generation.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval university looked backwards: it professed to be a\r\nstorehouse of old knowledge, and except in the way of dialectic\r\ncobweb-spinning, its professors had nothing to do with novelties. Of\r\nthe historical and physical (natural) sciences, of criticism and\r\nlaboratory practice, it knew nothing. Oral teaching was of supreme\r\nimportance on account of the cost and rarity of manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe modern university looks forward, and is a factory of new knowledge:\r\nits professors have to be at the top of the wave of progress. Research\r\nand criticism must be the breath of their nostrils; laboratory work the\r\nmain business of the scientific student; books his main helpers.\r\n\r\nThe lecture, however, in the hands of an able man will still have the\r\nutmost importance in stimulating and giving facts and principles their\r\nproper relative prominence.\r\n\r\nI think we should get pretty nearly what is wanted by grafting a\r\nCollege de France on to the University of London, subsidising\r\nUniversity College and King's College (if it will get rid of its tests,\r\nnot otherwise), and setting up two or three more such bodies in other\r\nparts of London. (Scotland, with a smaller population than London, has\r\nfour complete universities!)\r\n\r\nI should hand over the whole business of medical education and\r\ngraduation to a medical universitas to be constituted by the royal\r\ncolleges and medical schools, whose doings, of course, would be checked\r\nby the Medical Council.\r\n\r\nOur side has been too apt to look upon medical schools as feeders for\r\nScience. They have been so, but to their detriment as medical schools.\r\nAnd now that so many opportunities for purely scientific training are\r\nafforded, there is no reason they should remain so.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the Medical University is to make an average man into a\r\ngood practical doctor before he is twenty-two, and with not more\r\nexpense than can be afforded by the class from which doctors are\r\nrecruited, or than will be rewarded by the prospect of an income of 400\r\nto 500 pounds a year.\r\n\r\nIt is not right to sacrifice such men, and the public on whom they\r\npractise, for the prospect of making 1 per cent of medical students\r\ninto men of science.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[An undated draft in his own handwriting (probably the draft of a\r\nspeech delivered the first time he came to the committee as President,\r\nOctober 26) expands the same idea as to the modern requirements of the\r\nUniversity:--]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal fact in the University question, appears to me to be this:\r\nthat the student to whose wants the mediaeval University was adjusted,\r\nlooked to the past and sought book-learning, while the modern looks to\r\nthe future and seeks the knowledge of things.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval view was that all knowledge worth having was explicitly\r\nor implicitly contained in various ancient writings; in the Scriptures,\r\nin the writings of the greater Greeks, and those of the Christian\r\nFathers. Whatever apparent novelty they put forward, was professedly\r\nobtained by deduction from ancient data.\r\n\r\nThe modern knows that the only source of real knowledge lies in the\r\napplication of scientific methods of inquiry to the ascertainment of\r\nthe facts of existence; that the ascertainable is infinitely greater\r\nthan the ascertained, and that the chief business of the teacher is not\r\nso much to make scholars as to train pioneers.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, the University occupies a position altogether\r\nindependent of that of the coping-stone of schools for general\r\neducation, combined with technical schools of Theology, Law, and\r\nMedicine. It is not primarily an institution for testing the work of\r\nschoolmasters, or for ascertaining the fitness of young men to be\r\ncurates, lawyers, or doctors.\r\n\r\nIt is an institution in which a man who claims to devote himself to\r\nScience or Art, should be able to find some one who can teach him what\r\nis already known, and train him in the methods of knowing more.\r\n\r\nI include under Art,--Literature, the pictorial and plastic art with\r\nArchitecture, and Music; and under Science,--Logic, Philosophy,\r\nPhilology, Mathematics, and the Physical Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe question of the connection of the High Schools for general\r\neducation, and of the technical schools of Theology, Law, Medicine,\r\nEngineering, Art, Music, and so on, with the University is a matter of\r\npractical detail. Probably the teaching of the subjects which stand in\r\nthe relation of preliminaries to technical teaching and final studies\r\nin higher general education in the University would be utilised by the\r\ncolleges and technical schools.\r\n\r\nAll that I have to say on this subject is, that I see no reason why the\r\nexisting University of London should not be completed in the sense I\r\nhave defined by grafting upon it a professoriate with the appropriate\r\nmeans and appliances, which would supply London with the analogue of\r\nthe Ecole des hautes Etudes and the College de France in Paris, and of\r\nthe Laboratories with the Professor Extraordinarius and Privat Docenten\r\nin the German Universities.\r\n\r\n[A new Commission was promised to look into the whole question of the\r\nLondon University. This is referred to in a letter to Sir J. Donnelly\r\nof March 30, 1892.]\r\n\r\nUnless you want to kill Foster, don't suggest him for the Commission.\r\nHe is on one already.\r\n\r\nThe whole affair is a perfect muddle of competing crude projects and\r\nvested interests, and is likely to end in a worse muddle, as anything\r\nbut a patch up is, I believe, outside practical politics at present.\r\n\r\nIf I had carte blanche, I should cut away the technical \"Faculties\" of\r\nMedicine, Law, and Theology, and set up first-class chairs in\r\nLiterature, Art, Philosophy, and pure Science--a sort of combination of\r\nSorbonne (without Theology) and College de France.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven I have never been asked to say anything, and my chimaeras\r\nremain in petto. They would be scouted.\r\n\r\n[On the other hand, he was most anxious to keep the School of Science\r\nat South Kensington entirely independent. He writes again on May 26:--]\r\n\r\nI trust Rucker and Thorpe are convinced by this time that I knew what I\r\nwas talking about when I told them, months ago, that there would be an\r\neffort to hook us into the new University hotch-potch.\r\n\r\nI am ready to oppose any such project tooth and nail. I have not been\r\nstriving these thirty years to get Science clear of their\r\nschoolmastering sham-literary peddling to give up the game without a\r\nfight. I hope my Lords will be staunch.\r\n\r\nI am glad my opinion is already on record.\r\n\r\n[And similarly to Sir M. Foster on October 30:--]\r\n\r\nYou will have to come to London and set up physiology at the Royal\r\nCollege of Science. It is the only place in Great Britain in which\r\nscientific teaching is trammelled neither by parsons nor by\r\nlitterateurs. I have always implored Donnelly to keep us clear of any\r\nconnection with a University of any kind, sort, or description, and I\r\ntried to instil the same lesson into the doctors the other day. But the\r\n\"liberal education\" cant is an obsession of too many of them.\r\n\r\n[A further step was taken in June, when he was sent a new draft of\r\nproposals, afterwards adopted by the above-mentioned general meeting of\r\nthe Association in March 1893, sketching a constitution for a new\r\nuniversity, and asking for the appointment of a Statutory Commission to\r\ncarry it out. The University thus constituted was to be governed by a\r\nCourt, half of which should consist of university professors] (\"As for\r\na government by professors only\" [he writes in the \"Times\" of December\r\n6, 1892], \"the fact of their being specialists is against them. Most of\r\nthem are broad-minded; practical men; some are good administrators.\r\nBut, unfortunately, there is among them, as in other professions, a\r\nfair sprinkling of one-idea'd fanatics, ignorant of the commonest\r\nconventions of official relation, and content with nothing if they\r\ncannot get everything their own way. It is these persons who, with the\r\nvery highest and purest intentions, would ruin any administrative body\r\nunless they were counterpoised by non-professional, common-sense\r\nmembers of recognised weight and authority in the conduct of affairs.\"\r\n[Furthermore, against the adoption of a German university system, he\r\ncontinues], \"In holding up the University of Berlin as our model, I\r\nthink you fail to attach sufficient weight to the considerations that\r\nthere is no Minister of Public Instruction in these realms; that a\r\ngreat many of us would rather have no university at all than one under\r\nthe control of such a minister, and whose highest representatives might\r\ncome to be, not the fittest men, but those who stood foremost in the\r\ngood graces of the powers that be, whether Demos, Ministry, or\r\nSovereign.\"); [it was to include such faculties as Law, Engineering,\r\nMedicine, while it was to bring into connection the various teaching\r\nbodies scattered over London. The proposers themselves recognised that\r\nthe scheme was not ideal, but a compromise which at least would not\r\nhamper further progress, and would supersede the Gresham scheme, which\r\nthey regarded as a barrier to all future academic reform.\r\n\r\nThe Association as thus constituted Huxley now joined, and was\r\nimmediately asked to accept the Presidency, not that he should do any\r\nmore militant work than he was disposed to attempt, but simply that he\r\nshould sit like Moltke in his tent and keep an eye on the campaign.\r\n\r\nHe felt it almost a point of honour not to refuse his best services to\r\na cause he had always had at heart, though he wrote:--]\r\n\r\nThere are some points in which I go further than your proposals, but\r\nthey are so much, to my mind, in the right direction that I gladly\r\nsupport them.\r\n\r\n[And again:--]\r\n\r\nThe Association scheme is undoubtedly a compromise--but it is a\r\ncompromise which takes us the right way, while the former schemes led\r\nnowhere except to chaos.\r\n\r\n[He writes to Sir W.H. Flower:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, June 27, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Flower,\r\n\r\nI had quite given up the hope that anything but some wretched\r\ncompromise would come of the University Commission, when I found, to my\r\nsurprise, no less than gratification, that a strong party among the\r\nyounger men were vigorously taking the matter up in the right (that is,\r\nMY) sense.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all my good resolves to be a \"hermit old in mossy cell,\" I\r\nhave enlisted--for ambulance service if nothing better.\r\n\r\nThe move is too important to spare oneself if one can be of any good.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Of his work in this position Professor Karl Pearson says, in a letter\r\nto me:--\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley gallantly came to lead a somewhat forlorn hope,--that\r\nof establishing a really great university in London. He worked, as may\r\nnaturally be supposed, with energy and persistence, and one, who like\r\nmyself was not in full sympathy with the lines he took, can but admire\r\nthe vigour he threw into the movement. Nothing came of it\r\npractically;...but Professor Huxley's leadership did, at any rate, a\r\ngreat deal to unite the London teachers, and raise their ideal of a\r\ntrue university, while at the same time helping to repress the\r\nself-interests of many persons and institutions which had been before\r\nvery much to the front.\r\n\r\nClearly this is the sort of thing referred to in a letter of December\r\n20:--]\r\n\r\nGot through the Association business very well, but had to show that I\r\nam the kind of head that does not lend itself to wagging by the tail.\r\n\r\n[The Senate of the University of London showed practical unanimity in\r\naccepting the idea of taking on teaching functions if the Commission\r\nshould think it desirable, though the Medical Schools were still\r\ndesirous of getting their degree granted on the mere license\r\nexamination of the Royal Colleges, without any evidence of general\r\nculture or academical training, and on July 28 Huxley writes:--]\r\n\r\nThe decision of the representatives of the Medical Schools is just such\r\nas I should have expected. I always told my colleagues in the Senate of\r\nthe University of London that such was their view, and that, in the\r\nwords of Pears' advertisement, they \"would not be happy till they got\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they won't get it unless the medical examining bodies are connected\r\ninto a distinct degree-giving body.\r\n\r\n[In the course of the autumn matters seemed to be progressing. He\r\nwrites to Sir M. Foster, November 9:--]\r\n\r\nI am delighted to say that Paget [Sir James Paget, Vice-Chancellor of\r\nthe University.] has taken up the game, and I am going to a committee\r\nof the University this day week to try my powers of persuasion. If the\r\nSenate can only be got to see where salvation lies and strike hard\r\nwithout any fooling over details, we shall do a great stroke of\r\nbusiness for the future generations of Londoners.\r\n\r\n[And by the end of the year he writes:--]\r\n\r\nI think we are going to get something done, as the Senate of the\r\nUniversity of London has come into line with us, and I hope University\r\nCollege will do the same.\r\n\r\n[Meanwhile he was asked if he would appear before the Commission and\r\ngive evidence--to \"talk without interrogation\" so as to convince the\r\nCommission of the inadequacy of the teaching of science in general and\r\nof the absence of means and appliances for the higher teaching. This he\r\ndid early in January 1893, representing partly his own views, partly\r\nthose of the Association, to whom he read what he proposed to say,\r\nbefore being authorised to speak on their behalf.\r\n\r\nHis position is finally defined by the following letter:--]\r\n\r\nFebruary 9, 1893.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Weldon,\r\n\r\nI wish anything I have said or shall say about the organisation of the\r\nNew University to be taken in connection with the following postulates\r\nwhich I conceive to be of primary importance:\r\n\r\n1. The New University is not to be a separate body from the present\r\nUniversity of London.\r\n\r\n2. All persons giving academic instruction of a certain rank are to be\r\n\"University Professors.\"\r\n\r\n3. The Senate is to contain a large proportion of representatives of\r\nthe \"University Professors\" with a limited term of office (say five\r\nyears).\r\n\r\n4. The University chest is to receive all fees and other funds for\r\nUniversity purposes; and the Professors are to be paid out of it,\r\naccording to work done for the University--thus putting an end to the\r\npresent commercial competition of teaching institutions.\r\n\r\n5. In all questions of Teaching, Examination, and Discipline the\r\nauthority of the Senate is to be supreme--(saving appeal to the Privy\r\nCouncil).\r\n\r\nYour questions will be readily answered if these postulates are kept in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIn the case you put, the temptation to rivalry would not exist; and I\r\nshould imagine that the Senate would refuse funds for the purpose of\r\nduplicating an existing Institution, unless very strong grounds for so\r\ndoing could be shown. In short, they would adopt the plan which\r\ncommends itself to you.\r\n\r\nThat to which I am utterly opposed is the creation of an Established\r\nChurch Scientific, with a hierarchical organisation and a professorial\r\nEpiscopate. I am fully agreed with you that all trading competition\r\nbetween different teaching institutions is a thing to be abolished (see\r\nNumber 4 above).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, intellectual competition is a very good thing, and\r\nperfect freedom of learning and teaching the best of all things.\r\n\r\nIf you put a physical, chemical, or biological bishop at the head of\r\nthe teachers of those sciences in London, you will do your best to\r\ndestroy that freedom. My bar to any catastrophe of that sort lies in\r\nNumber 3. Let us take the case of Biology. I suppose there will be, at\r\nleast, half a dozen Professoriates in different branches of this\r\nsubject each Professor will be giving the same amount of time and\r\nenergy to University work, and will deserve the same pay. Each, if he\r\nis worth his salt, will be a man holding his own views on general\r\nquestions, and having as good a right as any other to be heard. Why is\r\none to be given a higher rank and vastly greater practical influence\r\nthan all the rest? Why should not each be a \"University Professor\" and\r\nhave his turn on the Senate in influencing the general policy of the\r\nUniversity? The nature of things drives men more and more into the\r\nposition of specialists. Why should one specialist represent a whole\r\nbranch of science better than another, in Council or in Administration?\r\n\r\nI am afraid we cannot build upon the analogy of Cambridge. In the first\r\nplace, London is not Cambridge; and, in the second, Michael Fosters do\r\nnot grow on every bush.\r\n\r\nThe besetting sin of able men is impatience of contradiction and of\r\ncriticism. Even those who do their best to resist the temptation, yield\r\nto it almost unconsciously and become the tools of toadies and\r\nflatterers. \"Authorities,\" \"disciples,\" and \"schools\" are the curse of\r\nscience; and do more to interfere with the work of the scientific\r\nspirit than all its enemies.\r\n\r\nThus you will understand why I have so strongly opposed \"absorption.\"\r\nNo one can feel more strongly than I the need of getting the present\r\nchaos into order and putting an end to the absurd waste of money and\r\nenergy. But I believe that end may be attained by the method of\r\nunification which I have suggested; without bringing in its train the\r\nevils which will inevitably flow from \"absorptive\" regimentation.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to see is such an organisation of the means and appliances\r\nof University instruction in all its branches, as will conduce to the\r\nlargest possible freedom of research, learning, and teaching. And if\r\nanybody will show me a better way to that end than through the measures\r\nI have suggested, I will gladly leave all and follow him.\r\n\r\nI am yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Will you be so kind as to let Professor Lankester see this\r\nletter, as I am writing to him and shirk the labour of going over the\r\nwhole ground again.\r\n\r\n[His last public activity, indeed, was on behalf of University reform,\r\nwhen in January 1895 he represented not only the Association, but, in\r\nthe enforced absence of Sir James Paget, the Senate of the University\r\nalso, on a deputation to Lord Rosebery, then Prime Minister, to whom he\r\nwrote asking if he were willing to receive such a deputation.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, December 4, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Lord Rosebery,\r\n\r\nA number of scientific people, in fact I think I may say all the\r\nleading men of science, and especially teachers in the country, are\r\nvery anxious to see the University of London reorganised upon the\r\ngeneral principles set forth in the Report of the last Royal Commission.\r\n\r\nTo this end nothing is wanted but the institution of a strong Statutory\r\nCommission; and we have all been hoping that a Bill would be introduced\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is rumoured that there are lions in the path. But even lions are\r\noccasionally induced to retreat by the sight of a large body of\r\nbeaters. And some of us think that such a deputation as would willingly\r\nwait on you, might hasten the desired movement.\r\n\r\nWe proposed something of the kind to Mr. Acland months ago, but nothing\r\nhas come of the suggestion--not, I am sure, from any want of good will\r\nto our cause on his part.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few days I have been so strongly urged to bring the\r\nmatter before you, that in spite of some doubts as to the propriety of\r\ngoing beyond my immediate chief the V.P. [The Vice-President of the\r\nCommittee of Council, Mr. Acland.] even in my private capacity I\r\nventure to make this appeal.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Lord Rosebery, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.10.\r\n\r\n1892.\r\n\r\n[Several letters of this year touch on educational subjects. The\r\nfollowing advice as to the best training for a boy in science, was\r\naddressed to Mr. Briton Riviere, R.A.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, June 19, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Riviere,\r\n\r\nTouching the training of your boy who wants to go in for science, I\r\nexpect you will have to make a compromise between that which is\r\ntheoretically desirable and that which is practically most\r\nadvantageous, things being as they are.\r\n\r\nThough I say it that shouldn't, I don't believe there is so good a\r\ntraining in physical science to be got anywhere as in our College at\r\nSouth Kensington. But Bernard could hardly with advantage take this up\r\nuntil he is seventeen at least. What he would profit by most as a\r\npreliminary, is training in the habit of expressing himself well and\r\nclearly in English; training in mathematics and the elements of\r\nphysical science; in French and German, so as to read those languages\r\neasily--especially German; in drawing--not for hifalutin art, of which\r\nhe will probably have enough in the blood--but accurate dry\r\nreproduction of form--one of the best disciplines of the powers of\r\nobservation extant.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the way of practical advantage in any career,\r\nthere is a great deal to be said for sending a clever boy to Oxford or\r\nCambridge. There are not only the exhibitions and scholarships, but\r\nthere is the rubbing shoulders with the coming generation which puts a\r\nman in touch with his contemporaries as hardly anything else can do. A\r\nvery good scientific education is to be had at both Cambridge and\r\nOxford, especially Cambridge now.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sending to the university, putting through the Latin and\r\nGreek mill will be indispensable. And if he is not going to make the\r\nclassics a serious study, there will be a serious waste of time and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nSo much in all these matters depends on the x contained in the boy\r\nhimself. If he has the physical and mental energy to make a mark in\r\nscience, I should drive him straight at science, taking care that he\r\ngot a literary training through English, French, and German. An average\r\ncapacity, on the other hand, may be immensely helped by university\r\nmeans of flotation.\r\n\r\nBut who in the world is to say how the x will turn out, before the real\r\nstrain begins? One might as well prophesy the effect of a glass of\r\n\"hot-with\" when the relative quantities of brandy, water, and sugar are\r\nunknown. I am sure the large quantity of brandy and the very small\r\nquantity of sugar in my composition were suspected neither by myself,\r\nnor any one else, until the rows into which wicked men persisted in\r\ninvolving me began!\r\n\r\nAnd that reminds me that I forgot to tell the publishers to send you a\r\ncopy of my last peace-offering [The \"Essays on Controverted\r\nQuestions.\"], and that one will be sent you by to-morrow's post. There\r\nis nothing new except the prologue, the sweet reasonableness of which\r\nwill, I hope, meet your approbation.\r\n\r\nIt is not my fault if you have had to toil through this frightfully\r\nlong screed; Mrs. Riviere, to whom our love, said you wanted it. \"Tu\r\nl'as voulu, Georges Dandin.\"\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following deals with State intervention in intermediate\r\neducation:--]\r\n\r\n(For Sunday morning's leisure, or take it to church and read it in your\r\nhat.)\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, October 1, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for sending on my letter. I do not suppose it will do much\r\ngood, but, at any rate, I thought I ought to try to prevent their\r\nmaking a mess of medical education.\r\n\r\nI like what I have seen of Acland. He seemed to have both intelligence\r\nand volition.\r\n\r\nAs to intermediate education I have never favoured the notion of State\r\nintervention in this direction.\r\n\r\nI think there are only two valid grounds for State meddling with\r\neducation: the one the danger to the community which arises from dense\r\nignorance; the other, the advantage to the community of giving capable\r\nmen the chance of utilising their capacity.\r\n\r\nThe first furnishes the justification for compulsory elementary\r\neducation. If a child is taught reading, writing, drawing, and\r\nhandiwork of some kind; the elements of mathematics, physics, and\r\nhistory, and I should add of political economy and geography; books\r\nwill furnish him with everything he can possibly need to make him a\r\ncompetent citizen in any rank of life.\r\n\r\nIf with such a start, he has not the capacity to get all he needs out\r\nof books, let him stop where he is. Blow him up with intermediate\r\neducation as much as you like, you will only do the fellow a mischief\r\nand lift him into a place for which he has no real qualification.\r\nPeople never will recollect, that mere learning and mere cleverness are\r\nof next to no value in life, while energy and intellectual grip, the\r\nthings that are inborn and cannot be taught, are everything.\r\n\r\nThe technical education act goes a long way to meet the second claim of\r\nthe State; so far as scientific and industrial capacities are\r\nconcerned. In a few years there will be no reason why any potential\r\nWhitworth or Faraday, in the three kingdoms, should not readily obtain\r\nthe best education that is to be had, scientific or technical. The same\r\nwill hold good for Art. So the question that arises seems to me to be\r\nwhether the State ought or ought not to do something of the same kind\r\nfor Literature, Philosophy, History, and Philology.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think not, on the ground that the universities and\r\npublic schools ought to do this very work, and that as soon as they\r\ncease to be clericalised seminaries they probably will do it.\r\n\r\nIf the present government would only give up their Irish fad--and bring\r\nin a bill to make it penal for any parson to hold any office in a\r\npublic school or university or to presume to teach outside the\r\npulpit--they should have my valuable support!\r\n\r\nI should not wonder if Gladstone's mind is open on the subject. Pity I\r\nam not sufficiently a persona grata with him to offer to go to Hawarden\r\nand discuss it.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with you, therefore, that it will play the deuce if\r\nintermediate education is fossilised as it would be by any Act prepared\r\nunder present influences. The most I should like to see done, would be\r\nto help the youth of special literary, linguistic and so forth,\r\ncapacity, to get the best training in their special line.\r\n\r\nIt was lucky we did not go to you. My wife got an awful dose of\r\nneuralgia and general upset, and was laid up at the Hotel. The house\r\nwas not quite finished inside, but we came in on Tuesday, and she has\r\nbeen getting better ever since in spite of the gale.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to hear of the recurrence of influenza. It is a beastly\r\nthing. Lord Justice Bowen told me he has had it every time it has been\r\nin the country. You must come and try Eastbourne air as soon as we are\r\nsettled. With our love to you and Mrs. Donnelly.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nBetter be careful, I return all letters on which R.H. is not in full.\r\n[An allusion to his recent Privy Councillorship. See below.]\r\n\r\n[The next is to a young man with aspirations after an intellectual\r\ncareer, who asked his advice as to the propriety of throwing up his\r\nbusiness, and plunging into literature or science:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 5, 1892.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI am very sorry that the pressure of other occupations has prevented me\r\nfrom sending an earlier reply to your letter.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion a man's first duty is to find a way of supporting\r\nhimself, thereby relieving other people of the necessity of supporting\r\nhim. Moreover, the learning to do work of practical value in the world,\r\nin an exact and careful manner, is of itself a very important\r\neducation, the effects of which make themselves felt in all other\r\npursuits. The habit of doing that which you do not care about when you\r\nwould much rather be doing something else, is invaluable. It would have\r\nsaved me a frightful waste of time if I had ever had it drilled into me\r\nin youth.\r\n\r\nSuccess in any scientific career requires an unusual equipment of\r\ncapacity, industry, and energy. If you possess that equipment you will\r\nfind leisure enough after your daily commercial work is over, to make\r\nan opening in the scientific ranks for yourself. If you do not, you had\r\nbetter stick to commerce. Nothing is less to be desired than the fate\r\nof a young man, who, as the Scotch proverb says, in \"trying to make a\r\nspoon spoils a horn,\" and becomes a mere hanger-on in literature or in\r\nscience, when he might have been a useful and a valuable member of\r\nSociety in other occupations.\r\n\r\nI think that your father ought to see this letter.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The last of the series, addressed to the secretary of a free-thought\r\nassociation, expresses his firmly rooted disgust at the use of mere\r\nribaldry in attacking the theological husks which enclose a religious\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nMay 22, 1892.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI regret that I am unable to comply with the wish of your committee.\r\nFor one thing, I am engaged in work which I do not care to interrupt,\r\nand for another, I always make it a rule in these matters to \"fight for\r\nmy own hand.\" I do not desire that any one should share my\r\nresponsibility for what I think fit to say, and I do not wish to be\r\nresponsible for the opinions and modes of expression of other persons.\r\n\r\nI do not say this with any reference to Mr. -- who is a sober and\r\ncareful writer. But both as a matter of principle and one of policy, I\r\nstrongly demur to a great deal of what appears as \"free thought\"\r\nliterature, and I object to be in any way connected with it. Heterodox\r\nribaldry disgusts me, I confess, rather more than orthodox fanaticism.\r\nIt is at once so easy; so stupid; such a complete anachronism in\r\nEngland, and so thoroughly calculated to disgust and repel the very\r\nthoughtful and serious people whom it ought to be the great aim to\r\nattract. Old Noll knew what he was about when he said that it was of no\r\nuse to try to fight the gentlemen of England with tapsters and\r\nserving-men. It is quite as hopeless to fight Christianity with\r\nscurrility. We want a regiment of Ironsides.\r\n\r\n[This summer brought Huxley a most unexpected distinction in the shape\r\nof admission to the Privy Council. Mention has already been made\r\n(volume 2) of his reasons for refusing to accept a title for\r\ndistinction in science, apart from departmental administration. The\r\nproper recognition of science, he maintained, lay in the professional\r\nrecognition of a man's work by his peers in science, the members of the\r\nlearned societies of his own and other countries.\r\n\r\nBut, as has been said, the Privy Councillorship was an office, not a\r\ntitle, although with a title attaching to the office; and in theory, at\r\nleast, a scientific Privy Councillor might some day play an important\r\npart as an accredited representative of science, to be consulted\r\nofficially by the Government, should occasion arise.\r\n\r\nOf a selection of letters on the subject, mostly answers to\r\ncongratulations, I place first the one to Sir M. Foster, which gives\r\nthe fullest account of the affair.]\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, August 23, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nI am very glad you think I have done rightly about the P.C.; but in\r\nfact I could hardly help myself.\r\n\r\nYears and years ago I was talking to Donnelly about these things, and\r\ntold him that so far as myself was concerned, I would have nothing to\r\ndo with official decorations--didn't object to other people having\r\nthem, especially heads of offices, like Hooker and Flower--but\r\npreferred to keep clear myself. But I added that there was one thing I\r\ndid not mind telling him, because no English Government would ever act\r\nupon my opinion--and that was that the P.C. was a fit and proper\r\nrecognition for science and letters. I have no doubt that he has kept\r\nthis in mind ever since--in fact Lord Salisbury's letter (which was\r\nvery handsome) showed he had been told of my obiter dictum. Donnelly\r\nwas the first channel of inquiry whether I would accept, and was very\r\nstrong that I should.\r\n\r\nSo you see if I had wished to refuse it, it would have been difficult\r\nand ungracious. But, on the whole, I thought the precedent good.\r\nPlayfair tells me he tried to get it done in the case of Faraday and\r\nBabbage thirty years ago, and the thing broke down. Moreover a wicked\r\nsense of the comedy of advancing such a pernicious heretic, helped a\r\ngood deal.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is, I have just had a summons to go to Osborne on\r\nThursday and it is as much as I shall be able to do.\r\n\r\nWe have been in South Wales, in the neighbourhood of the Colliers, and\r\nare on our way to the Wallers for the Festival week at Gloucester. We\r\nhope to get back to Eastbourne in the latter half of September and find\r\nthe house clean swept and garnished. After that, by the way, it is NOT\r\nnice to say that we shall hope to have a visit from Mrs. Foster and you.\r\n\r\nWith our love to you both.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI am glad you are resting, but oh, why another Congress!\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, June 21, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nYou have been and done me at last, you betrayer of confidence. This is\r\nwhat comes of confiding one's pet weakness to a bosom-friend!\r\n\r\nBut I can't deny my own words, or the accuracy of your devil of a\r\nmemory--and, moreover, I think the precedent of great importance.\r\n\r\nI have always been dead against orders of merit and the like, but I\r\nthink that men of letters and science who have been of use to the\r\nnation (Lord knows if I have) may fairly be ranked among its nominal or\r\nactual councillors.\r\n\r\nAs for yourself, it is only one more kindness on the top of a heap so\r\nbig I shall say nothing about it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Right Honourable sends her love to you both, and promises not to\r\nbe proud.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, August 20, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nI began to think that Lord Salisbury had thought better of it--(I\r\nshould not have been surprised at all if he had) and was going to leave\r\nme a P.P.C. instead of a P.C. when the announcement appeared yesterday.\r\n\r\nThis morning, however, I received his own letter (dated the 16th),\r\nwhich had been following me about. A very nice letter it is too--he\r\ndoes the thing handsomely while he is about it.\r\n\r\nWell, I think the thing is good for science; I am not such a self\r\nhumbug as to pretend that my vanity is not pleasantly tickled; but I do\r\nnot think there is any aspect of the affair more pleasant to me, than\r\nthe evidence it affords of the strength of our old friendship. Because\r\nwith all respect for my noble friends, deuce a one would ever have\r\nthought of it, unless you had not only put it--but rubbed it--into\r\ntheir heads.\r\n\r\nI have not forgotten that private and confidential document that you\r\nwere so disgusted to find had been delivered to me! You have tried it\r\non before--so don't deny it.\r\n\r\nBut bless my soul, how profound is old Cole's remark about the humour\r\nof public affairs. To think of a Conservative Government--pride of the\r\nChurch--going out of its way to honour one not only of the wicked, but\r\nof the notoriousest and plain-spoken wickedness. My wife and I drove\r\nover to Dolgelly yesterday--do you know it? one of the loveliest things\r\nin the three kingdoms--and every now and then had a laugh over this\r\nvery quaint aspect of the affair.\r\n\r\nCan you tell me what I shall have to do in the dim and distant future?\r\nI suppose I shall have to go and swear somewhere (I am always ready to\r\ndo that on occasion). Is admission to the awful presence of Her Majesty\r\ninvolved? Shall I have to rig up again in that Court suit, which I\r\nhoped was permanently laid up in lavender? Resolve me these things.\r\n\r\nWe shall be here I expect at least another week; and bring up at\r\nGloucester about the 3rd September. Hope to get back to Hodeslea latter\r\npart of September.\r\n\r\nEver yours faithfully.\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nTo Sir J.D. Hooker.\r\n\r\nAugust 20.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen that I have been made a P.C. If I had been offered\r\nto be made a police constable I could not have been more flabbergasted\r\nthan I was when the proposition came to me a few weeks ago. I will tell\r\nyou the story of how it all came about when we meet. The Archbishopric\r\nof Canterbury is the only object of ambition that remains to me. Come\r\nand be Suffragan; there is plenty of room at Lambeth and a capital\r\ngarden!\r\n\r\n[To his youngest daughter:--]\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, August 22, 1892.\r\n\r\nDearest Babs,\r\n\r\nIf Lord Salisbury had known my address, M-- and I should have had our\r\nlittle joke out before leaving Saundersfoot [Where he had been staying\r\nwith his daughter.], as the letter was dated 16th. It must be a month\r\nsince Lord Cranbrook desired Donnelly to find out if I would accept the\r\nP.C., and as I heard no more about it up to the time of dissolution, I\r\nimagined there was a hitch somewhere. And really, the more I think of\r\nit the queerer does it seem, that a Tory and Church Government should\r\nhave delighted to honour the worst-famed heretic in the three kingdoms.\r\n\r\nI am sure Donnelly has been at the bottom of it, as he is the only\r\nperson to whom I ever spoke of the fitness of the P.C. for men of\r\nscience and letters.\r\n\r\nThe queer thing is that his chief and Lord Salisbury listened to the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nTell Jack he is simply snuffed out--younger sons of peers go with the\r\nherd of Barts and knights, I believe. But a table of precedence is not\r\nto be had for love or money--and my anxiety is wearing.\r\n\r\nThis place is as perfectly delightful as Aberystwith was t'other...\r\n\r\nWith best love to you all.\r\n\r\nEver your Pater.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. W.K. Clifford.\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, August 22, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Lucy,\r\n\r\nI am glad to think that it is the honours that blush and not the\r\nrecipient, for I am past that form of vascular congestion.\r\n\r\nIt was known that the only peerage I would accept was a spiritual one;\r\nand as Her Majesty shares the not unnatural prejudice which led her\r\nillustrious predecessor (now some time dead) to object to give a\r\nbishopric to Dean Swift, it was thought she could not stand the\r\npromotion of Dean Huxley; would see * him in fact... * This is a pun.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury apologised for not pressing the matter, but pointed out\r\nthat, as Evolutionism is rapidly gaining ground among the people who\r\nhave votes, it was probable, if not certain, that his eminent successor\r\n(whose mind is always open) would become a hot evolutionist before the\r\nexpiration of the eight months' office which Lord Salisbury (who needs\r\nrest) means to allow him. And when eminent successor goes out, my\r\nbishopric will be among the Dissolution Honours. If Her Majesty objects\r\nshe will be threatened with the immediate abolition of the House of\r\nLords, and the institution of a social democratic federation of\r\ncounties, each with an army, navy, and diplomatic service of its own.\r\n\r\nI know you like to have the latest accurate intelligence, but this\r\nreally must be considered confidential. As a P.C. I might lose my head\r\nfor letting out State secrets.\r\n\r\nEver your affectionate Pater.\r\n\r\nTo Sir Joseph Fayrer.\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, Wales, August 28, 1892.\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant to get the congratulations of an old friend like\r\nyourself. As we went to Osborne the other day I looked at the old\r\n\"Victory\" and remembered that six and forty years ago I went up her\r\nside to report myself on appointment, as a poor devil of an assistant\r\nsurgeon. And I should not have got that far if you had not put it into\r\nmy heed to apply to Burnett.\r\n\r\nTo Sir Joseph Prestwich.\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, August 31, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Prestwich,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for your congratulations. As I have certainly got more than\r\nmy temporal deserts, the other \"half\" you speak of can be nothing less\r\nthan a bishopric! May you live to see that dignity conferred; and go on\r\nwriting such capital papers as the last you sent me, until I write\r\nmyself your Right Reverend as well as Right Honourable old friend,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nTo Sir W.H. Flower.\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth, August 31, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Flower,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your congratulations, with Lady Flower's postscript not\r\nforgotten. I should have answered your letter sooner, but I had to go\r\nto Osborne last week in a hurry, kiss hands and do my swearing. It was\r\nvery funny that the Gladstone P.C.'s had the pleasure of welcoming the\r\nSalisbury P.C.'s among their first official acts!\r\n\r\nI will gladly come to as many meetings of the Trustees as I can. Only\r\nyou must not expect me in very severe weather like that so common last\r\nyear. My first attack of pleurisy was dangerous and not painful; the\r\nsecond was painful and not dangerous; the third will probably be both\r\npainful and dangerous, and my commander-in-chief (who has a right to be\r\nheard in such matters) will not let me run the risk of it.\r\n\r\nBut I have marked down October 22 and November 24, and nothing short of\r\nsnow shall stop me.\r\n\r\nAs to what you want to do, getting butter out of a dog's mouth is an\r\neasier job than getting patronage out of that of a lawyer or an\r\necclesiastic. But I am always good for a forlorn hope, and we will have\r\na try.\r\n\r\nWe shall not be back at Eastbourne till the latter half of September,\r\nand I doubt if we shall get into our house even then. We leave this for\r\nGloucester, where we are going to spend the festival week with my\r\ndaughter to-morrow.\r\n\r\nWith our love to you both, ever yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI see a report that Owen is sinking. Poor old man; it seems queer that\r\njust as I am hoist to the top of my tree he should be going\r\nunderground. But at 88 life cannot be worth much.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. W.F. Collier.\r\n\r\nCors-y-Gedol Hotel, Barmouth Water, August 31, 1892.\r\n\r\nAccept my wife's and my hearty thanks for your kind congratulations.\r\nWhen I was a mere boy I took for motto of an essay, \"What is honour?\r\nWho hath it? He that died o' Wednesday,\" and although I have my full\r\nshare of ambition and vanity, I doubt not, yet Falstaff's philosophical\r\nobservation has dominated my mind and acted as a sort of perpetual\r\nrefrigerator to these passions. So I have gone my own way, sought for\r\nnone of these things and expected none--and it would seem that the\r\ndeepest schemer's policy could not have answered better. We must have a\r\nnew Beatitude, \"Blessed is the man who expecteth nothing,\" without its\r\nordinary appendix.\r\n\r\nI tell Jack [His son-in-law, Hon. John Collier.] I have worked hard for\r\na dignity which will enable me to put down his aristocratic swaggering.\r\n\r\n[It took some time, however, to get used to the title, and it was\r\nOctober before he wrote:--]\r\n\r\nThe feeling that \"The Right Honourable\" on my letters is a piece of\r\nchaff is wearing off, and I hope to get used to my appendix in time.\r\n\r\n[The \"very quaint\" ceremony of kissing hands is described at some\r\nlength in a letter to Mrs. Huxley from London on his way back from\r\nOsborne:--]\r\n\r\nGreat Western Hotel, August 25, 1892, 6.40 P.M.\r\n\r\nI have just got back from Osborne, and I find there are a few minutes\r\nto send you a letter--by the help of the extra halfpenny. First-rate\r\nweather there and back, a special train, carriage with postillions at\r\nthe Osborne landing-place, and a grand procession of officers of the\r\nnew household and P.C.'s therein. Then waiting about while the various\r\n\"sticks\" were delivered.\r\n\r\nThen we were shown into the presence chamber where the Queen sat at a\r\ntable. We knelt as if we were going to say our prayers, holding a\r\ntestament between two, while the Clerk of the Council read an oath of\r\nwhich I heard not a word. We each advanced to the Queen, knelt and\r\nkissed her hand, retired backwards, and got sworn over again (Lord\r\nknows what I promised and vowed this time also). Then we shook hands\r\nwith all the P.C.'s present, including Lord Lorne, and so exit\r\nbackwards. It was all very curious...\r\n\r\nAfter that a capital lunch and back we came. Ribblesdale and several\r\nother people I knew were of the party, and I found it very pleasant\r\ntalking with him and Jesse Collings, who is a very interesting man.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"how I wish my poor mother, who was a labouring woman--a\r\ngreat noble woman--and brought us nine all up in right ways, could have\r\nbeen alive.\" Very human and good and dignified too, I thought.\r\n\r\nHe also used to tell how he was caught out when he thought to make use\r\nof the opportunity to secure a close view of the Queen. Looking up, he\r\nfound her eyes fixed upon him; Her Majesty had clearly taken the\r\nopportunity to do the same by him.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Privy Councillorship as an exceptional honour for\r\nscience, over and above any recognition of his personal services, which\r\nhe thought amply met by the Civil List pension specially conferred upon\r\nhim as an honour at his retirement from the public service, Huxley was\r\nno little vexed at an article in \"Nature\" for August 25 (volume 46 page\r\n397), reproaching the Government for allowing him to leave the public\r\nservice six years before, without recognition. Accordingly he wrote to\r\nSir J. Donnelly on August 27:--]\r\n\r\nIt is very unfair to both Liberal and Conservative Governments, who did\r\nmuch more for me than I expected, and I feel that I ought to contradict\r\nthe statement without loss of time.\r\n\r\nSo I have written the inclosed letter for publication in \"Nature\". But\r\nas it is always a delicate business to meddle with official matters, I\r\nwish you would see if I have said anything more than I ought to say in\r\nthe latter half of the letter. If so, please strike it out, and let the\r\nfirst half go.\r\n\r\nI had a narrow shave to get down to Osborne and kiss hands on Thursday.\r\nWhat a quaint ceremony it is!\r\n\r\nThe humour of the situation was that we three hot Unionists, White\r\nRidley, Jesse Collings, and I, were escorted by the whole Gladstonian\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n[And again on August 30:--]\r\n\r\nIn the interview I had with Lord Salisbury on the subject of an order\r\nof merit--ages ago [See above.]--I expressly gave him to understand\r\nthat I considered myself out of the running--having already received\r\nmore than I had any right to expect. And when he has gone out of his\r\nway to do honour to science, it is stupid of \"Nature\" to strike the\r\ndiscordant note.\r\n\r\n[His letter appeared in \"Nature\" of September 1 (volume 46 page 416).\r\nIn it he declared that both Lord Salisbury's and Mr. Gladstone's\r\nGovernments had given him substantial recognition that Lord Iddesleigh\r\nhad put the Civil List pension expressly as an honour; and finally,\r\nthat he himself placed this last honour in the category of] \"unearned\r\nincrements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.11.\r\n\r\n1892.\r\n\r\n[The following letters are mainly of personal interest; some merely\r\nillustrate the humorous turn he would give to his more intimate\r\ncorrespondence; others strike a more serious note, especially those to\r\nfriends whose powers were threatened by overwork or ill-health.\r\n\r\nWith these may fitly come two other letters; one to a friend on his\r\nre-marriage, the other to his daughter, in reply to a birthday letter.]\r\n\r\nMy wife and I send our warmest good wishes to your future wife and\r\nyourself. I cannot but think that those who are parted from us, if they\r\nhave cognisance of what goes on in this world, must rejoice over\r\neverything that renders life better and brighter for the sojourners in\r\nit-- especially of those who are dear to them. At least, that would be\r\nmy feeling.\r\n\r\nPlease commend us to Miss --, and beg her not to put us on the \"Index,\"\r\nbecause we count ourselves among your oldest and warmest friends.\r\n\r\n[To his daughter, Mrs. Roller:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, May 5, 1892.\r\n\r\nIt was very pleasant to get your birthday letter and the photograph,\r\nwhich is charming.\r\n\r\nThe love you children show us, warms our old age better than the sun.\r\n\r\nFor myself the sting of remembering troops of follies and errors, is\r\nbest alleviated by the thought that they may make me better able to\r\nhelp those who have to go through like experiences, and who are so dear\r\nto me that I would willingly pay an even heavier price, to be of use.\r\nDepend upon it, that confounded \"just man who needed no repentance\" was\r\na very poor sort of a father. But perhaps his daughters were \"just\r\nwomen\" of the same type; and the family circle as warm as the interior\r\nof an ice-pail.\r\n\r\n[A certain artist, who wanted to have Huxley sit to him, tried to\r\nmanage the matter through his son-in-law, Hon. J. Collier, to whom the\r\nfollowing is addressed:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, January 27, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jack,\r\n\r\nInclosed is a letter for you. Will you commit the indiscretion of\r\nsending it on to Mr. A.B. if you see no reason to the contrary?\r\n\r\nI hope the subsequent proceedings will interest you no more.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you have been so bothered by the critter--but in point of\r\npertinacity he has met his match. (I have no objection to your saying\r\nthat your father-in-law is a brute, if you think that will soften his\r\ndisappointment.)\r\n\r\nHere the weather has been tropical. The bananas in the new garden are\r\nnearly ripe, and the cocoanuts are coming on. But of course you expect\r\nthis, for if it is unbearably sunny in London what must it be here?\r\n\r\nAll our loves to all of you.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately, Pater.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 1, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI hear you have influenza rampaging about the Camp [The name of Sir J.\r\nHooker's house at Sunningdale.] and I want to point out to you that if\r\nyou want a regular bad bout of it, the best thing you can do is to go\r\nhome next Thursday evening, at ten o'clock at night, and plunge into\r\nthe thick of the microbes, tired and chilled.\r\n\r\nIf you don't get it then, you will, at any rate, have the satisfaction\r\nof feeling that you have done your best!\r\n\r\nI am going to the x, but then you see I fly straight after dinner to\r\nCollier's per cab, and there is no particular microbe army in Eton\r\nAvenue lying in wait for me.\r\n\r\nEither let me see after the dinner, or sleep in town, and don't worry.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 19, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI have just received a notice that Hirst's funeral is to-morrow. But we\r\nare in the midst of the bitterest easterly gale and snowfall we have\r\nhad all the winter, and there is no sign of the weather mending.\r\n\r\nNeither you nor I have any business to commit suicide for that which\r\nafter all is a mere sign of the affection we have no need to prove for\r\nour dear old friend, and the chances are that half an hour cold chapel\r\nand grave-side on a day like this would finish us.\r\n\r\nI write this not that I imagine you would think of going, but because\r\nmy last note spoke so decidedly of my own intention.\r\n\r\nBut who could have anticipated this sudden reversion to Arctic\r\nconditions!\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 18, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nMy wife got better and was out for a while yesterday, but she is\r\nknocked up again to-day.\r\n\r\nIt would have been very pleasant to see you both, but you must not come\r\ndown till we get fixed with a new cook and maid, as I believe we are to\r\nbe in a week or so. None of your hotel-going!\r\n\r\nI mourn over the departure of the present cookie--I believe she is\r\ngoing for no other reason than that she is afraid the house will fall\r\non such ungodly people as we are, and involve her in the ruins. That is\r\nthe modern martyrdom--you don't roast infidels, but people who can\r\nroast go to the pious.\r\n\r\nLovely day to-day, nothing but east wind to remind one it is not\r\nsummer.--Crocuses coming out at last.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 27, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI had to run up to town on Friday and forgot your letter. The x is a\r\npuzzle--I will stick by the ship as long as you do, depend upon that. I\r\nfear we can hardly expect to see dear old Tyndall there again. As for\r\nmyself, I dare not venture when snow is on the ground, as on the last\r\ntwo occasions. And now, I am sorry to say, there is another possible\r\nimpediment in my wife's state of health.\r\n\r\nI have had a very anxious time of it altogether lately. But sich is\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nMy sagacious grand-daughter Joyce (gone home now) observed to her\r\ngrandmother some time ago--\"I don't want to grow up.\" \"Why don't you\r\nwant to grow up?\" \"Because I notice that grown-up people have a great\r\ndeal of trouble.\" Sagacious philosopheress of 7!\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, April 3, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nAs I so often tell my wife, \"your confounded sense of duty will be the\r\nruin of you.\" You really, club or no club, had no business to be\r\ntravelling in such a bitter east wind. However, I hope the recent\r\nsunshine has set you up again.\r\n\r\nBarring snow or any other catastrophe, I will be at \"the Club\" dinner\r\non the 26th and help elect the P.R.S. I don't think I go more than once\r\na year, and like you I find the smaller the pleasanter meetings.\r\n\r\nI was very sorry to see Bowman's death. What a first-rate man of\r\nscience he would have been if the Professorship at King's College had\r\nbeen 1000 pounds a year. But it was mere starvation when he held it.\r\n\r\nI am glad to say that my wife is much better--thank yours for her very\r\nkind sympathy. I was very down the last time I wrote to you.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, June 27, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nMy wife has been writing to Mrs. Foster to arrange for your visit,\r\nwhich will be heartily welcome.\r\n\r\nNow I don't want to croak. No one knows better than I, the fatal\r\nnecessity for any one in your position: more than that, the duty in\r\nmany cases of plunging into public functions, and all the guttle,\r\nguzzle, and gammon therewith connected.\r\n\r\nBut do let me hold myself up as the horrid example of what comes of\r\nthat sort of thing for men who have to work as you are doing and I have\r\ndone. To be sure you are a \"lungy\" man and I am a \"livery\" man, so that\r\nyour chances of escaping candle-snuff accumulations with melancholic\r\nprostration are much better. Nevertheless take care. The pitcher is a\r\nvery valuable piece of crockery, and I don't want to live to see it\r\ncracked by going to the well once too often.\r\n\r\nI am in great spirits about the new University movement, and have told\r\nthe rising generation that this old hulk is ready to be towed out into\r\nline of battle, if they think fit, which is more commendable to my\r\npublic spirit than my prudence.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, June 20, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nMy wife and I, no less than the Hookers who have been paying us a short\r\nvisit, were very much grieved to hear that such a serious trouble has\r\nbefallen you.\r\n\r\nIn such cases as yours (as I am sure your doctors have told you)\r\nhygienic conditions are everything--good air and idleness, CONSTRUED\r\nSTRICTLY, among the chief. You should do as I have done--set up a\r\ngarden and water it yourself for two hours every day, besides pottering\r\nabout to see how things grow (or don't grow this weather) for a couple\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nSundry box-trees, the majority of which have been getting browner every\r\nday since I planted them three months ago, have interested me almost as\r\nmuch as the general election. They typify the Empire with the G.O.M. at\r\nwork at the root of it!\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, October 18, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nI throw dust and ashes on my head for having left your letter almost a\r\nweek unanswered.\r\n\r\nBut I went to Tennyson's funeral; and since then my whole mind has been\r\ngiven to finishing the reply forced upon me by Harrison's article in\r\nthe \"Fortnightly\", and I have let correspondence slide. I think it will\r\nentertain you when it appears in November--and perhaps interest--by the\r\nadumbration of the line I mean to take if ever that \"Romanes\" Lecture\r\nat Oxford comes off.\r\n\r\nAs to Madeira--I do not think you could do better. You can have as much\r\nquiet there as in Venice, for there are next to no carts or carriages.\r\nI was at an excellent hotel, the \"Bona Vista,\" kept by an Englishman in\r\nexcellent order, and delightfully situated on the heights outside\r\nFunchal. When once acclimatised and able to bear moderate fatigue, I\r\nshould say nothing would be more delightful and invigorating than to\r\ntake tents and make the round of the island. There is nothing I have\r\nseen anywhere which surpasses the cliff scenery of the north side, or\r\non the way thither, the forest of heaths as big as sycamores.\r\n\r\nThere is a matter of natural history which might occupy without\r\nfatiguing you, and especially without calling for any great use of the\r\neyes. That is the effect of Madeiran climate on English plants\r\ntransported there--and the way in which the latter are beating the\r\nnatives. There is a Doctor who has lots of information on the topic.\r\nYou may trust anything but his physic.\r\n\r\n[The rest of the letter gives details about scientific literature\r\ntouching Madeira.\r\n\r\nA piece of advice to his son anent building a house:--]\r\n\r\nSeptember 22, 1892.\r\n\r\nLastly and biggestly, don't promise anything, agree to anything, nor\r\nsign anything (swear you are an \"illiterate voter\" rather than this\r\nlast) without advice--or you may find yourself in a legal quagmire.\r\nBuilders, as a rule, are on a level with horse-dealers in point of\r\nhonesty--I could tell you some pretty stories from my small experience\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n[The next, to Lord Farrer, is apropos of quite an extensive\r\ncorrespondence in the \"Times\" as to the correct reading of the\r\nwell-known lines about the missionary and the cassowary, to which both\r\nHuxley and Lord Farrer had contributed their own reminiscences.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, October 15, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Farrer,\r\n\r\nIf YOU were a missionary\r\nIn the heat of Timbuctoo\r\nYOU'd wear nought but a nice and airy\r\nPair of bands--p'raps cassock too.\r\n\r\nDon't you see the fine touch of local colour in my version! Is it not\r\nobvious to everybody who understands the methods of high a priori\r\ncriticism that this consideration entirely outweighs the merely\r\nempirical fact that your version dates back to 1837--which I must admit\r\nis before my adolescence? It is obvious to the meanest capacity that\r\nmine must be the original text in \"Idee,\" whatever your wretched\r\n\"Wirklichkeit\" may have to say to the matter.\r\n\r\nAnd where, I should like to know, is a glimmer of a scintilla of a hint\r\nthat the missionary was a dissenter? I claim him for my dear National\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following is about a document which he had forgotten that he\r\nwrote:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 24, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that you have somebody in the Department who is an adept\r\nin the imitation of handwriting.\r\n\r\nAs there is no way of proving a negative, and I am too loyal to raise a\r\nscandal, I will just father the scrawl.\r\n\r\nPositively, I had forgotten all about the business. I suppose because I\r\ndid not hear who was appointed. It would be a good argument for turning\r\npeople out of office after 65! But I have always had rather too much of\r\nthe lawyer faculty of forgetting things when they are done with.\r\n\r\nIt was very jolly to have you here, and on principles of Christian\r\nbenevolence you must not be so long in coming again.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI do not remember being guilty of paying postage--but that doesn't\r\ncount for much.\r\n\r\n[The following is an answer to one of the unexpected inquiries which\r\nwould arrive from all quarters. A member of one of the religious orders\r\nworking in the Church of England wrote for an authoritative statement\r\non the following point, suggested by passages in section 5 of Chapter 1\r\nof the \"Elementary Physiology\":--When the Blessed Sacrament,\r\nconsisting, temporally and mundanely speaking, of a wheaten wafer and\r\nsome wine, is received after about seven hours' fast, is it or is it\r\nnot \"voided like other meats\"? In other words, does it not become\r\ncompletely absorbed for the sustenance of the body?\r\n\r\nHuxley's help in this physiological question--and his answer was to be\r\nused in polemical discussion--was sought because an answer from him\r\nwould be decisive and would obviate the repetition of statements which\r\nto a Catholic were painfully irreverent.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, February 3, 1892.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nI regret that you have had to wait so long for a reply to your letter\r\nof the 27th. Your question required careful consideration, and I have\r\nbeen much occupied with other matters.\r\n\r\nYou ask (1), whether the sacramental bread is or is not \"voided like\r\nother meats\"?\r\n\r\nThat depends on what you mean, firstly by \"voided,\" and, secondly, by\r\n\"other meats.\" Suppose any \"meat\" (I take the word to include drink) to\r\ncontain no indigestible residuum, there need not be anything \"voided\"\r\nat all--if by \"voiding\" is meant expulsion from the lower intestine.\r\n\r\nSuch a meat might be \"completely absorbed for the sustenance of the\r\nbody.\" Nevertheless, its elements, in fresh combinations, would be\r\neventually \"voided\" through other channels, e.g. the lungs and kidneys.\r\nThus I should say that under normal circumstances all \"meats\" (that is\r\nto say, the material substance of them) are voided sooner or later.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the particular case of the sacramental wafer and wine.\r\nTaking their composition and the circumstances of administration to be\r\nas you state them, it is my opinion that a small residuum will be left\r\nundigested, and will be voided by the intestine, while by far the\r\ngreater part will be absorbed and eventually \"voided\" by the lungs,\r\nskin, and kidneys.\r\n\r\nIf any one asserts that the wafer and wine are voided by the intestine\r\nas such, that the \"pure flour and water\" of which the wafer consists\r\npass out unchanged, I am of opinion he is in error.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if any one maintains that the material substance of\r\nthe wafer persists, while its accidents change, within the body, and\r\nthat this identical substance is sooner or later voided, I do not see\r\nhow he is to be driven out of that position by any scientific\r\nreasoning. On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that the\r\nelementary particles of the wafer and of the wine which enter the body\r\nnever lose their identity, or even alter their mass. If one could see\r\none of the atoms of carbon which enter into the composition of the\r\nwafer, I conceive it could be followed the whole way--from the mouth to\r\nthe organ by which it escapes--just as a bit of floating charcoal might\r\nbe followed into, through, and out of a whirlpool.\r\n\r\n[On October 6, 1892, died Lord Tennyson. In the course of his busy\r\nlife, Huxley had not been thrown very closely into contact with him;\r\nthey would meet at the Metaphysical Society, of which Tennyson was a\r\nsilent member; and in the \"Life of Tennyson\" two occasions are recorded\r\non which Huxley visited him.\r\n\r\nNovember 11, 1871.\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley and Mr. Knowles arrived here (Aldworth) on a visit. Mr.\r\nHuxley was charming. We had much talk. He was chivalrous, wide, and\r\nearnest, so that one could not but enjoy talking with him. There was a\r\ndiscussion on George Eliot's humility. Huxley and A. both thought her a\r\nhumble woman, despite a dogmatic manner of assertion that had come upon\r\nher latterly in her writings. (Op. cit. 2 110.)\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1873.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall and Mr. Huxley called. Mr. Huxley seemed to be\r\nuniversal in his interest, and to have keen enjoyment of life. He spoke\r\nof \"In Memoriam\". (Ibid. 2 143.)\r\n\r\nWith this may be compared one of Mr. Wilfrid Ward's reminiscences\r\n(\"Nineteenth Century\" August\r\n1896).\r\n\r\n\"Huxley once spoke strongly of the insight into scientific method shown\r\nin Tennyson's 'In Memoriam', and pronounced it to be quite equal to\r\nthat of the greatest experts.\"\r\n\r\nThis view of Tennyson appears again in a letter to Sir M. Foster, the\r\nSecretary of the Royal Society:--]\r\n\r\nWas not Tennyson a Fellow of the Royal Society? If so, should not the\r\nPresident and Council take some notice of his death and delegate some\r\none to the funeral to represent them? Very likely you have thought of\r\nit already.\r\n\r\nHe was the only modern poet, in fact I think the only poet since the\r\ntime of Lucretius, who has taken the trouble to understand the work and\r\ntendency of the men of science.\r\n\r\n[But this was not the only side from which he regarded poetry. He had a\r\nkeen sense for beauty, the artistic perfection of expression, whether\r\nin poetry, prose, or conversation. Tennyson's talk he described thus:\r\n\"Doric beauty is its characteristic--perfect simplicity, without any\r\nornament or anything artificial.\" And again, to quote Mr. Wilfrid\r\nWard's reminiscences:--\r\n\r\nTennyson he considered the greatest English master of melody except\r\nSpenser and Keats. I told him of Tennyson's insensibility to music, and\r\nhe replied that it was curious that scientific men, as a rule, had more\r\nappreciation of music than poets or men of letters. He told me of one\r\nlong talk he had had with Tennyson, and added that immortality was the\r\none dogma to which Tennyson was passionately devoted.\r\n\r\nOf Browning, Huxley said]: \"He really has music in him. Read his poem\r\n\"The Thrush\" and you will see it. Tennyson said to me,\" [he added],\r\n\"that Browning had plenty of music IN him, but he could not get it OUT.\"\r\n\r\nEastbourne, October 15, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nI think you will like to hear that the funeral yesterday lacked nothing\r\nto make it worthy of the dead or the living.\r\n\r\nBright sunshine streamed through the windows of the nave, while the\r\nchoir was in half gloom, and as each shaft of light illuminated the\r\nflower-covered bier as it slowly travelled on, one thought of the\r\nbright succession of his works between the darkness before and the\r\ndarkness after. I am glad to say that the Royal Society was represented\r\nby four of its chief officers, and nine of the commonalty, including\r\nmyself. Tennyson has a right to that, as the first poet since Lucretius\r\nwho has understood the drift of science.\r\n\r\nWe have heard nothing of you and your wife for ages. Ask her to give us\r\nnews, good news I hope, of both.\r\n\r\nMy wife is better than she was, and joins with me in love.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[On his way home from the funeral in Westminster Abbey, Huxley passed\r\nthe time in the train by shaping out some lines on the dead poet, the\r\nform of them suggested partly by some verses of his wife's, partly by\r\nSchiller's\r\n\r\nGib diesen Todten mir heraus,\r\nIch muss ihn wieder haben [Don Carlos, scene 9.],\r\n\r\nwhich came back to his mind in the Abbey. The lines were published in\r\nthe \"Nineteenth Century\" for November 1892. He declared that he\r\ndeserved no credit for the verses; they merely came to him in the train.\r\n\r\nHis own comparison of them with the sheaf of professed poets' odes\r\nwhich also appeared in the same magazine, comes in a letter to his\r\nwife, to whom he sent the poem as soon as it appeared in print.]\r\n\r\nI know you want to see the poem, so I have cut it and the rest out of\r\nthe \"Nineteenth\" just arrived, and sent it.\r\n\r\nIf I wore to pass judgment upon it in comparison with the others, I\r\nshould say, that as to style it is hammered, and as to feeling human.\r\n\r\nThey are castings of much prettier pattern and of mainly\r\npoetico-classical educated-class sentiment. I do not think there is a\r\nline of mine one of my old working-class audience would have boggled\r\nover. I would give a penny for John Burns' thoughts about it.\r\n(N.B.--Highly impartial and valuable criticism.)\r\n\r\n[He also wrote to Professor Romanes, who had been moved by this new\r\ndeparture to send him a volume of his own poems:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, November 3, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nI must send you a line to thank you very much for your volume of poems.\r\nA swift glance shows me much that has my strong sympathy--notably\r\n\"Pater loquitur,\" which I shall read to my wife as soon as I get her\r\nback. Against all troubles (and I have had my share) I weigh a\r\nwife-comrade \"treu und fest\" in all emergencies.\r\n\r\nI have a great respect for the Nazarenism of Jesus--very little for\r\nlater \"Christianity.\" But the only religion that appeals to me is\r\nprophetic Judaism. Add to it something from the best Stoics and\r\nsomething from Spinoza and something from Goethe, and there is a\r\nreligion for men. Some of these days I think I will make a cento out of\r\nthe works of these people.\r\n\r\nI find it hard enough to write decent prose and have usually stuck to\r\nthat. The \"Gib diesen Todten\" I am hardly responsible for, as it did\r\nitself coming down here in the train after Tennyson's funeral. The\r\nnotion came into my head in the Abbey.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This winter also Sir R. Owen died, and was buried at Ham on December\r\n23. The grave ends all quarrels, and Huxley intended to be present at\r\nthe funeral. But as he wrote to Dr. Foster on the 23rd:--]\r\n\r\nI had a hard morning's work at University College yesterday, and what\r\nwith the meeting of the previous evening and that infernal fog, I felt\r\nso seedy that I made up my mind to go straight home and be quiet...\r\n\r\nThere has been a bitter north-easter all day here, and if the like has\r\nprevailed at Ham I am glad I kept out of it, as I am by no means fit to\r\ncope with anything of that kind to-day. I do not think I was bound to\r\noffer myself up to the manes of the departed, however satisfactory that\r\nmight have been to the poor old man. Peace be with him!\r\n\r\n[But the old-standing personal differences between the two made it\r\ndifficult for him to decide what to do with regard to a meeting to\r\nraise some memorial to the great anatomist. He writes again to Sir M.\r\nFoster, January 8, 1893:--]\r\n\r\nWhat am I to do about the meeting about Owen's statue on the 21st? I do\r\nnot wish to pose either as a humbugging approver or as a sulky\r\ndisapprover. The man did honest work, enough to deserve his statue, and\r\nthat is all that concerns the public.\r\n\r\n[And on the 18th:--]\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that I had better attend the meeting at all\r\ncosts. But I do not see why I should speak unless I am called upon to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nI have no earthly objection to say all that I honestly can of good\r\nabout Owen's work--and there is much to be said about some of it--on\r\nthe contrary, I should be well pleased to do so.\r\n\r\nBut I have no reparation to make; if the business were to come over\r\nagain, I should do as I did. My opinion of the man's character is\r\nexactly what it was, and under the circumstances there is a sort of\r\nhypocrisy about volunteering anything, which goes against my grain.\r\n\r\nThe best position for me would be to be asked to second the resolution\r\nfor the statue--then the proposer would have the field of personal\r\nfiction and butter-boat all to himself.\r\n\r\nTo Sir W.H. Flower.\r\n\r\nDecember 28, 1892.\r\n\r\nI think you are quite right in taking an active share in the movement\r\nfor the memorial. When a man is dead and can do no more harm, one must\r\ndo a sum in subtraction:--\r\n\r\nmerits, deserts over x+x+x\r\n\r\nand if the x's are not all minus quantities, give him credit\r\naccordingly. But I think that in your appeal, for which the Committee\r\nwill be responsible, it is this balance of solid scientific merit--a\r\ngood big one in Owen's case after all deductions--which should be alone\r\nreferred to. If you follow the example of \"Vanity Fair\" and call him \"a\r\nsimple-minded man, who had he been otherwise, would long ago have\r\nadorned a title,\" some of us may choke.\r\n\r\nGladstone, Samuel of Oxford, and Owen belong to a very curious type of\r\nhumanity, with many excellent and even great qualities and one fatal\r\ndefect--utter untrustworthiness. Peace be with two of them, and may the\r\npolitical death of the third be speedy and painless!\r\n\r\nWith our united best wishes, ever yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And on January 22, 1893, he writes of the meeting:--]\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\n...What queer corners one gets into if one only lives long enough! The\r\ngrim humour of the situation when I was seconding the proposal for a\r\nstatue to Owen yesterday tickled me a good deal. I do not know how they\r\nwill report me in the \"Times\", but if they do it properly I think you\r\nwill see that I said no word upon which I could not stand\r\ncross-examination.\r\n\r\nI chose the office of seconder in order that I might clearly define my\r\nposition and stop the mouths of blasphemers--who would have ascribed\r\nsilence or absence to all sorts of bad motives.\r\n\r\nWhatever the man might be, he did a lot of first-rate work, and now\r\nthat he can do no more mischief he has a right to his wages for it.\r\n\r\nIf I only live another ten years I expect to be made a saint of myself.\r\n\"Many a better man has been made a saint of,\" as old Davie Hume said to\r\nhis housekeeper when they chalked up \"St. David's Street\" on his wall.\r\n\r\nWe have been jogging along pretty well, but wife has been creaky, and I\r\ngot done up in a brutal London fog struggling with the worse fog of the\r\nNew University.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you like my poetical adventure.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[This speech had an unexpected sequel. Owen's grandson was so much\r\nstruck by it that he wrote asking Huxley to undertake a critical\r\naccount of his anatomical work for his biography,--another most\r\nunexpected turn of events. It is not often that a conspicuous opponent\r\nof a man's speculations is asked to pass judgment upon his entire work.\r\n[See below.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year an anonymous attack upon the administration of\r\nthe Royal Society was the occasion for some characteristic words on the\r\nendurance of abuse to his old friend, M. Foster, then Secretary of the\r\nRoyal Society.]\r\n\r\nDecember 5, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nThe braying of my donkey prevented me from sending a word of sympathy\r\nabout the noise made by yours...Let not the heart be vexed because of\r\nthese sons of Belial. It is all sound and fury with nothing at the\r\nbottom of it, and will leave no trace a year hence. I have been abused\r\na deal worse--without the least effect on my constitution or my comfort.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I am told that Harrison is abusing me just now like a\r\npickpocket in the \"Fortnightly\", and I only make the philosophical\r\nreflection, No wonder! and doubt if the reading it is worth half a\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letter to Mr. Clodd, thanking him for the new edition of\r\nBates' \"Naturalist on the Amazons\", helps to remove a reproach\r\nsometimes brought against the Royal Society, in that it ignored the\r\nclaims of distinguished men of Science to membership of the Society:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, December 9, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Clodd,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the new edition of \"Bates.\" I was reading the Life last\r\nnight with great interest; some of the letters you have printed are\r\nadmirable.\r\n\r\nLyell is hit off to the life. I never read a more penetrating\r\ncharacter-sketch. Hooker's letter of advice is as sage as might be\r\nexpected from a man who practised what he preached about as much as I\r\nhave done. I shall find material for chaff the next time my old friend\r\nand I meet.\r\n\r\nI think you are a little hard on the Trustees of the British Museum,\r\nand especially on the Royal Society. The former are hampered by the\r\nTreasury and the Civil Service regulations. If a Bates turned up now I\r\ndoubt if one could appoint him, however much one wished it, unless he\r\nwould submit to some idiotic examination. As to the Royal Society, I\r\nundertake to say that Bates might have been elected fifteen years\r\nearlier if he had so pleased. But the Council cannot elect a man unless\r\nhe is proposed, and I always understood that it was the res angusta\r\nwhich stood in the way.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with --. Twenty years ago the Royal Society awarded him\r\nthe Royal Medal, which is about as broad an invitation to join us as we\r\ncould well give a man. In fact, I do not think he has behaved well in\r\nquite ignoring it. Formerly there was a heavy entrance fee as well as\r\nthe annual subscription. But a dozen or fifteen years ago the more\r\npecunious Fellows raised a large sum of money for the purpose of\r\nabolishing this barrier. At present a man has to pay only 3 pounds a\r\nyear and no entrance. I believe the publications of the Society, which\r\nhe gets, will sell for more. [The \"Fee Reduction Fund,\" as it is now\r\ncalled, enables the Society to relieve a Fellow from the payment even\r\nof his annual fee, in that being F.R.S. costs him nothing.]\r\n\r\nSo you see it is not the fault of the Royal Society if anybody who\r\nought to be in keeps out on the score of means.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.12.\r\n\r\n1893.\r\n\r\n[The year 1893 was, save for the death of three old friends, Andrew\r\nClark, Jowett, and Tyndall, one of the most tranquil and peaceful in\r\nHuxley's whole life. He entered upon no direct controversy; he\r\npublished no magazine articles; to the general misapprehension of the\r\ndrift of his Romanes Lecture he only replied in the comprehensive form\r\nof Prolegomena to a reprint of the lecture. He began to publish his\r\nscattered essays in a uniform series, writing an introduction to each\r\nvolume. While collecting his \"Darwiniana\" for the second volume, he\r\nwrote to Mr. Clodd:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 18, 1892.\r\n\r\nI was looking through \"Man's Place in Nature\" the other day. I do not\r\nthink there is a word I need delete, nor anything I need add except in\r\nconfirmation and extension of the doctrine there laid down. That is\r\ngreat good fortune for a book thirty years old, and one that a very\r\nshrewd friend of mine implored me not to publish, as it would certainly\r\nruin all my prospects. I said, like the French fox-hunter in \"Punch\",\r\n\"I shall try.\"\r\n\r\n[The shrewd friend in question was none other than Sir William\r\nLawrence, whose own experiences after publishing his book \"On Man\",\r\n\"which now might be read in a Sunday school without surprising\r\nanybody,\" are alluded to in volume 1.\r\n\r\nHe had the satisfaction of passing on his unfinished work upon Spirula\r\nto efficient hands for completion; and in the way of new occupation,\r\nwas thinking of some day \"taking up the threads of late evolutionary\r\nspeculation\" in the theories of Weismann and others [See letter of\r\nSeptember 28, to Romanes.], while actually planning out and reading for\r\na series of \"Working-Men's Lectures on the Bible,\" in which he should\r\npresent to the unlearned the results of scientific study of the\r\ndocuments, and do for theology what he had done for zoology thirty\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nThe scheme drawn out in his note-book runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The subject and the method of treating it.\r\n\r\n2. Physical conditions:--the place of Palestine in the Old World.\r\n\r\n3. The Rise of Israel:--Judges, Samuel, Kings as far as Jeroboam II.\r\n\r\n4. The Fall of Israel.\r\n\r\n5. The Rise and Progress of Judaism. Theocracy.\r\n\r\n6. The Final Dispersion.\r\n\r\n7. Prophetism.\r\n\r\n8. Nazarenism.\r\n\r\n9. Christianity.\r\n\r\n10. Muhammedanism.\r\n\r\n11 and 12. The Mythologies.\r\n\r\nAlthough this scheme was never carried out, yet it was constantly\r\nbefore Huxley's mind during the two years left to him. If Death, who\r\nhad come so near eight years before, would go on seeming to forget him,\r\nhe meant to use these last days of his life in an effort to illuminate\r\none more portion of the field of knowledge for the world at large.\r\n\r\nAs the physical strain of the Romanes Lecture and his liability to loss\r\nof voice warned him against any future attempt to deliver a course of\r\nlectures, he altered his design and prepared to put the substance of\r\nthese Lectures to Working-Men into a Bible History for young people.\r\nAnd indeed, he had got so far with his preparation, that the latter\r\nheading was down in his list of work for the last year of his life,\r\n1895. But nothing of it was ever written. Until the work was actually\r\nbegun, even the framework upon which it was to be shaped remained in\r\nhis mind, and the copious marks in his books of reference were the mere\r\nguide-posts to a strong memory, which retained not words and phrases,\r\nbut salient facts and the knowledge of where to find them again.\r\n\r\nI find only two occasions on which he wrote to the \"Times\" this year;\r\none, when the crusade was begun to capture the Board Schools of London\r\nfor sectarianism, and it was suggested that, when on the first School\r\nBoard, he had approved of some such definite dogmatic teaching. This he\r\nset right at once in the following letter of April 28, with which may\r\nbe compared the letter to Lord Farrer of November 6, 1894:--]\r\n\r\nIn a leading article of your issue to-day you state, with perfect\r\naccuracy, that I supported the arrangement respecting religious\r\ninstruction agreed to by the London School Board in 1871, and hitherto\r\nundisturbed. But you go on to say that \"the persons who framed the\r\nrule\" intended it to include definite teaching of such theological\r\ndogmas as the Incarnation.\r\n\r\nI cannot say what may have been in the minds of the framers of the\r\nrule; but, assuredly, if I had dreamed that any such interpretation\r\ncould fairly be put upon it, I should have opposed the arrangement to\r\nthe best of my ability.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a year before the rule was framed I wrote an article in the\r\n\"Contemporary Review\", entitled \"The Board Schools--what they can do,\r\nand what they may do,\" in which I argued that the terms of the\r\nEducation Act excluded such teaching as it is now proposed to include.\r\nAnd I supported my contention by the following citation from a speech\r\ndelivered by Mr. Forster at the Birkbeck Institution in 1870:--\r\n\r\n\"I have the fullest confidence that in the reading and explaining of\r\nthe Bible, what the children will be taught will be the great truths of\r\nChristian life and conduct, which all of us desire they should know,\r\nand that no effort will be made to cram into their poor little minds,\r\ntheological dogmas which their tender age prevents them from\r\nunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n[The other was on a lighter, but equally perennial point of interest,\r\nbeing nothing less than the Sea Serpent. In the \"Times\" of January 11,\r\nhe writes, that while there is no reason against a fifty-foot serpent\r\nexisting as in Cretaceous seas, still the evidence for its existence is\r\nentirely inconclusive. He goes on to tell how a scientific friend's\r\nstatement once almost convinced him until he read the quartermaster's\r\ndeposition, which was supposed to corroborate it. The details made the\r\ncircumstances alleged by the former impossible, and on pointing this\r\nout, he heard no more of the story, which was a good example of the\r\nmixing up of observations with conclusions drawn from them.\r\n\r\nAnd on the following day he replies to another such detailed story:--]\r\n\r\nAdmiral Mellersh says, \"I saw a huge snake, at least 18 feet long,\" and\r\nI have no doubt he believes he is simply stating a matter of fact. Yet\r\nhis assertion involves a hypothesis of the truth of which I venture to\r\nbe exceedingly doubtful. How does he know that what he saw was a snake?\r\nThe neighbourhood of a creature of this kind, within axe-stroke, is\r\nhardly conducive to calm scientific investigation, and I can answer for\r\nit that the discrimination of genuine sea-snakes in their native\r\nelement from long-bodied fish is not always easy. Further, that \"back\r\nfin\" troubles me; looks, if I may say so, very fishy.\r\n\r\nIf the caution about mixing up observations with conclusions, which I\r\nventured to give yesterday, were better attended to, I think we should\r\nhear very little either about antiquated sea-serpents or new\r\n\"mesmerism.\"\r\n\r\n[It is perhaps not superfluous to point out that in this, as in other\r\ncases of the marvellous, he did not merely pooh-pooh a story on the\r\nground of its antecedent improbability, but rested his acceptance or\r\nrejection of it upon the strength of the evidence adduced. On the other\r\nhand, the weakness of such evidence as was brought forward time after\r\ntime, was a justification for refusing to spend his time in listening\r\nto similar stories based on similar testimony.\r\n\r\nAmong the many journalistic absurdities which fall in the way of\r\ncelebrities, two which happened this year are worth recording; the one\r\non account of its intrinsic extravagance, which succeeded nevertheless\r\nin taking in quite a number of sober folk; the other on account of the\r\nletter it drew from Huxley about his cat. The former appeared in the\r\nshape of a highly-spiced advertisement about certain Manx Mannikins,\r\nwhich could walk, draw, play, in fact do everything but speak--were\r\nliving pets which might be kept by any one, and indeed Professor Huxley\r\nwas the possessor of a remarkably fine pair of them. Apply, enclosing\r\nstamps etc. Of course, the wonderful mannikins were nothing more than\r\nthe pair of hands which anybody could dress up according to the\r\ninstructions of the advertiser; but it was astonishing how many\r\nestimable persons took them for some lusus naturae. A similar\r\nadvertisement in 1880 had been equally successful, and one exalted\r\npersonage wrote by the hand of a secretary to say what pleasure and\r\ninterest had been excited by the description of these strange\r\ncreatures, and begging Professor Huxley to state if the account was\r\ntrue. Accordingly on January 27 he writes to his wife, who was on a\r\nvisit to her daughter:--]\r\n\r\nYesterday two ladies called to know if they could see the Manx\r\nMannikins. I think of having a board put up to say that in the absence\r\nof the Proprietress the show is closed.\r\n\r\n[The other incident was a request for any remarks which might be of use\r\nin an article upon the Home Pets of Celebrities. I give the letter\r\nwritten in answer to this, as well as descriptions of the same cat's\r\ngoings-on in the absence of its mistress.]\r\n\r\nTo Mr. J.G. Kitton.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, April 12, 1893.\r\n\r\nA long series of cats has reigned over my household for the last forty\r\nyears, or thereabouts, but I am sorry to say that I have no pictorial\r\nor other record of their physical and moral excellences.\r\n\r\nThe present occupant of the throne is a large, young, grey\r\nTabby--Oliver by name. Not that he is in any sense a protector, for I\r\ndoubt whether he has the heart to kill a mouse. However, I saw him\r\ncatch and eat the first butterfly of the season, and trust that this\r\ngerm of courage, thus manifested, may develop with age into efficient\r\nmousing.\r\n\r\nAs to sagacity, I should say that his judgment respecting the warmest\r\nplace and the softest cushion in a room is infallible--his punctuality\r\nat meal times is admirable; and his pertinacity in jumping on people's\r\nshoulders, till they give him some of the best of what is going,\r\nindicates great firmness.\r\n\r\n[To his youngest daughter:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea Eastbourne, January 8, 1893.\r\n\r\nI wish you would write seriously to M--. She is not behaving well to\r\nOliver. I have seen handsomer kittens, but few more lively, and\r\nenergetically destructive. Just now he scratched away at something that\r\nM-- says cost 13 shillings 6 pence a yard--and reduced more or less of\r\nit to combings.\r\n\r\nM-- therefore excludes him from the dining-room, and all those\r\nopportunities of higher education which he would naturally have in MY\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI have argued that it is as immoral to place 13 shillings 6 pence a\r\nyard-nesses within reach of kittens as to hang bracelets and diamond\r\nrings in the front garden. But in vain. Oliver is banished--and the\r\nprotector (not Oliver) is sat upon.\r\n\r\nIn truth and justice aid your Pa.\r\n\r\n[This letter is embellished with fancy portraits of:--]\r\n\r\nOliver when most quiescent (tail up; ready for action).\r\nO. as polisher (tearing at the table leg).\r\nO. as plate basket investigator.\r\nO. as gardener (destroying plants in a pot).\r\nO. as stocking knitter (a wild tangle of cat and wool).\r\nO. as political economist making good for trade at 13 shillings 6 pence\r\na yard (pulling at a hassock).\r\n\r\n[The following to Sir John Evans refers to a piece of temporary\r\nforgetfulness.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 19, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Evans,\r\n\r\nIt is curious what a difference there is between intentions and acts,\r\nespecially in the matter of sending cheques. The moment I saw the\r\nproject of the Lawes and Gilbert testimonial in the \"Times\", I sent my\r\ncontribution in imagination--and it is only the arrival of this\r\ncircular which has waked me up to the necessity of supplementing my\r\nideal cheque by the real one inclosed.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Reference has been made to the writing of the Romanes Lecture in 1892.\r\nMr. Gladstone had already consented to deliver the first lecture in\r\nthat year; and early in the summer Professor Romanes sounded Huxley to\r\nfind out whether he would undertake the second lecture for 1893. Huxley\r\nsuggested a possible bar in his precarious health; but subject to this\r\npossibility, if the Vice-Chancellor did not regard it as a complete\r\ndisability, was willing to accept a formal invitation.\r\n\r\nProfessor Romanes reassured him upon this point, and further begged\r\nhim, if possible, to be ready to step into the breach if Mr. Gladstone\r\nshould be prevented from lecturing in the following autumn. The\r\nsituation became irresistible, and the second of the following letters\r\nto Mr. Romanes displays no more hesitation.]\r\n\r\nTo Professor Romanes.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, June 3, 1892.\r\n\r\nI should have written to you yesterday, but the book did not arrive\r\ntill this morning. Very many thanks for it. It looks appetising, and I\r\nlook forward to the next course.\r\n\r\nAs to the Oxford lecture, \"Verily, thou almost persuadest me,\" though I\r\nthought I had finished lecturing. I really should like to do it; but I\r\nhave a scruple about accepting an engagement of this important kind,\r\nwhich I might not be able to fulfil.\r\n\r\nI am astonishingly restored, and have not had a trace of heart trouble\r\nfor months. But I am quite aware that I am, physically speaking, on\r\ngood behaviour--and maintain my condition only by taking an amount of\r\ncare which is very distasteful to me.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, my wife's health is, I am sorry to say, extremely\r\nprecarious. She was very ill a fortnight ago, and to my very great\r\nregret, as well as hers, we are obliged to give up our intended visit\r\nto Balliol to-morrow. She is quite unfit to travel, and I cannot leave\r\nher here\r\nalone for three days.\r\n\r\nI think the state of affairs ought to be clear to the Vice-Chancellor.\r\nIf, in his judgment, it constitutes no hindrance, and he does me the\r\nhonour to send the invitation, I shall accept it.\r\n\r\nTo the same:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, June 7, 1892.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that age hath not altogether cleared the spirit of mischief\r\nout of my blood; and there is something so piquant in the notion of my\r\nacting as substitute for Gladstone that I will be ready if necessity\r\narises.\r\n\r\nOf course I will keep absolutely clear of Theology. But I have long had\r\nfermenting in my head, some notions about the relations of Ethics and\r\nEvolution (or rather the absence of such as are commonly supposed),\r\nwhich I think will be interesting to such an audience as I may expect.\r\n\"Without prejudice,\" as the lawyers say, that is the sort of topic that\r\noccurs to me.\r\n\r\n[To the same:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, October 30, 1892.\r\n\r\nI had to go to London in the middle of last week about the Gresham\r\nUniversity business, and I trust I have put a very long nail into the\r\ncoffin of that scheme. For which good service you will forgive my delay\r\nin replying to your letter. I read all about your show--why not call it\r\n\"George's Gorgeous,\" tout court?\r\n\r\nI should think that there is no living man, who, on such an occasion,\r\ncould intend and contrive to say so much and so well (in form) without\r\never rising above the level of antiquarian gossip.\r\n\r\nMy lecture would have been ready if the G.O.M. had failed you, but I am\r\nvery glad to have six months' respite, as I now shall be able to write\r\nand rewrite it to my heart's content.\r\n\r\nI will follow the Gladstonian precedent touching cap and gown--but I\r\ntrust the Vice-Chancellor will not ask me to take part in a \"Church\r\nParade\" and read the lessons. I couldn't--really.\r\n\r\nAs to the financial part of the business, to tell you the honest truth,\r\nI would much rather not be paid at all for a piece of work of this\r\nkind. I am no more averse to turning an honest penny by my brains than\r\nany one else in the ordinary course of things--quite the contrary; but\r\nthis is not an ordinary occasion. However, this is a pure matter of\r\ntaste, and I do not want to set a precedent which might be inconvenient\r\nto other people--so I agree to what you propose.\r\n\r\nBy the way, is there any type-writer who is to be trusted in Oxford?\r\nSome time ago I sent a manuscript to a London type-writer, and to my\r\ngreat disgust I shortly afterwards saw an announcement that I was\r\nengaged on the topic.\r\n\r\n[On the following day he writes to his wife, who was staying with her\r\nyoungest daughter in town:--]\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Chancellor has written to me and I have fixed May--exact day\r\nby and by. Mrs. Romanes has written a crispy little letter to remind us\r\nof our promise to go there, and I have chirrupped back.\r\n\r\n[The \"chirrup\" ran as follows:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, November 1, 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Romanes,\r\n\r\nI have just written to the Vice-Chancellor to say that I hope to be at\r\nhis disposition any time next May.\r\n\r\nMy wife is \"larking\"--I am sorry to use such a word, but what she is\r\npleased to tell me of her doings leaves me no alternative--in London,\r\nwhither I go on Thursday to fetch her back--in chains, if necessary.\r\nBut I know, in the matter of being \"taken in and done for\" by your\r\nhospitable selves, I may, for once, speak for her as well as myself.\r\n\r\nDon't ask anybody above the rank of a younger son of a Peer--because I\r\nshall not be able to go in to dinner before him or her--and that part\r\nof my dignity is naturally what I prize most. Would you not like me to\r\ncome in my P.C. suit? All ablaze with gold, and costing a sum with\r\nwhich I could buy, oh! so many books!\r\n\r\nOnly if your late experiences should prompt you to instruct your other\r\nguests not to contradict me--don't. I rather like it.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nBon Voyage! You can tell Mr. Jones [The hotel-keeper in Madeira.] that\r\nI will have him brought before the Privy Council and fined, as in the\r\ngood old days, if he does not treat you properly.\r\n\r\n[This letter was afterwards published in Mrs. Romanes' Life of her\r\nhusband, and three letters on that occasion, and particularly that in\r\nwhich Huxley tried to guard her from any malicious interpretation of\r\nhis jests, are to be found on page 332.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of May 18, 1893, he delivered at Oxford his Romanes\r\nLecture, on \"Evolution and Ethics,\" a study of the relation of ethical\r\nand evolutionary theory in the history of philosophy, the text of which\r\nis that while morality is necessarily a part of the order of nature,\r\nstill the ethical principle is opposed to the self-regarding principle\r\non which cosmic evolution has taken place. Society is a part of nature,\r\nbut would be dissolved by a return to the natural state of simple\r\nwarfare among individuals. It follows that ethical systems based on the\r\nprinciples of cosmic evolution are not logically sound. A study of the\r\nessays of the foregoing ten years will show that he had more than once\r\nenunciated this thesis, and it had been one of the grounds of his\r\nlong-standing criticism of Mr. Spencer's system.\r\n\r\nThe essence of this criticism is given in portions of two letters to\r\nMr. F.J. Gould, who, when preparing a pamphlet on \"Agnosticism writ\r\nPlain\" in 1889, wrote to inquire what was the dividing line between the\r\ntwo Agnostic positions.]\r\n\r\nAs between Mr. Spencer and myself, the question is not one of \"a\r\ndividing line,\" but of entire and complete divergence as soon as we\r\nleave the foundations laid by Hume, Kant, and Hamilton, who are MY\r\nphilosophical forefathers. To my mind the \"Absolute\" philosophies were\r\nfinally knocked on the head by Hamilton; and the \"Unknowable\" in Mr.\r\nSpencer's sense is merely the Absolute redivivus, a sort of ghost of an\r\nextinct philosophy, the name of a negation hocus-pocussed into a sham\r\nthing. If I am to talk about that of which I have no knowledge at all,\r\nI prefer the good old word \"God\", about which there is no scientific\r\npretence.\r\n\r\nTo my mind Agnosticism is simply the critical attitude of the thinking\r\nfaculty, and the definition of it should contain no dogmatic\r\nimplications of any kind. I, for my part, do not know whether the\r\nproblem of existence is insoluble or not; or whether the ultimate cause\r\n(if there be such a thing) is unknown or not. That of which I am\r\ncertain is, that no satisfactory solution of this problem has been\r\noffered, and that, from the nature of the intellectual faculty, I am\r\nunable to conceive that such a solution will ever be found. But on\r\nthat, as on all other questions, my mind is open to consider any new\r\nevidence that may be offered.\r\n\r\n[And later:--]\r\n\r\nI have long been aware of the manner in which my views have been\r\nconfounded with those of Mr. Spencer, though no one was more fully\r\naware of our divergence than the latter. Perhaps I have done wrongly in\r\nletting the thing slide so long, but I was anxious to avoid a breach\r\nwith an old friend...\r\n\r\nWhether the Unknowable or any other Noumenon exists or does not exist,\r\nI am quite clear I have no knowledge either way. So with respect to\r\nwhether there is anything behind Force or not, I am ignorant; I neither\r\naffirm nor deny. The tendency to idolatry in the human mind is so\r\nstrong that faute de mieux it falls down and worships negative\r\nabstractions, as much the creation of the mind as the stone idol of the\r\nhands. The one object of the Agnostic (in the true sense) is to knock\r\nthis tendency on the head whenever or wherever it shows itself. Our\r\nphysical science is full of it.\r\n\r\n[Nevertheless, the doctrine seemed to take almost everybody by\r\nsurprise. The drift of the lecture was equally misunderstood by critics\r\nof opposite camps. Huxley was popularly supposed to hold the same views\r\nas Mr. Spencer--for were they not both Evolutionists? On general\r\nattention being called to the existing difference between their views,\r\nsome jumped to the conclusion that Huxley was offering a general\r\nrecantation of evolution, others that he had discarded his former\r\ntheories of ethics. On the one hand he was branded as a deserter from\r\nfree thought; on the other, hailed almost as a convert to orthodoxy. It\r\nwas irritating, but little more than he had expected. The conditions of\r\nthe lecture forbade any reference to politics or religion; hence much\r\nhad to be left unsaid, which was supplied next year in the Prolegomena\r\nprefacing the re-issue of the lecture.\r\n\r\nAfter all possible trimming and compression, he still feared the\r\nlecture would be too long, and would take more than an hour to deliver,\r\nespecially if the audience was likely to be large, for the numbers must\r\nbe considered in reference to the speed of speaking. But he had taken\r\neven more pains than usual with it.] \"The Lecture,\" [he writes to\r\nProfessor Romanes on April 19], \"has been in type for weeks, if not\r\nmonths, as I have been taking an immensity of trouble over it. And I\r\ncan judge of nothing till it is in type.\" [But this very precaution led\r\nto unexpected complications. When the proposition to lecture was first\r\nmade to him, he was not sent a copy of the statute ordering that\r\npublication in the first instance should lie with the University Press;\r\nand in view of the proviso that \"the Lecturer is free to publish on his\r\nown behalf in any other form he may like,\" he had taken Professor\r\nRomanes' original reference to publication by the Press to be a\r\nsubsidiary request to which he gladly assented. However, a satisfactory\r\narrangement was speedily arrived at with the publishers; Huxley\r\nremarking:--]\r\n\r\nAll I have to say is, do not let the University be in any way a loser\r\nby the change. If the V.-C. thinks there is any risk of this, I will\r\ngladly add to what Macmillan pays. That matter can be settled between\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[However, he had not forgotten the limitation of his subject in respect\r\nof religion and politics, and he repeatedly refers to his careful\r\navoidance of these topics as an \"egg-dance.\" And wishing to reassure\r\nMr. Romanes on this head, he writes on April 22:--]\r\n\r\nThere is no allusion to politics in my lecture, nor to any religion\r\nexcept Buddhism, and only to the speculative and ethical side of that.\r\nIf people apply anything I say about these matters to modern\r\nphilosophies, except evolutionary speculation, and religions, that is\r\nnot my affair. To be honest, however, unless I thought they would, I\r\nshould never have taken all the pains I have bestowed on these 36 pages.\r\n\r\n[But these words conjured up terrible possibilities, and Mr. Romanes\r\nwrote back in great alarm to ask the exact state of the case. The two\r\nfollowing letters show that the alarm was groundless:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, April 26, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nI fear, or rather hope, that I have given you a very unnecessary scare.\r\n\r\nYou may be quite sure, I think, that, while I should have refused to\r\ngive the lecture if any pledge of a special character had been proposed\r\nto me, I have felt very strongly bound to you to take the utmost care\r\nthat no shadow of a just cause for offence should be given, even to the\r\nmost orthodox of Dons.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the best thing I can do is to send you the lecture\r\nas it stands, notes and all. But please return it within two days at\r\nfurthest, and consider it STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL between us two (I am\r\nnot excluding Mrs. Romanes, if she cares to look at the paper). No\r\nconsideration would induce me to give any ground for the notion that I\r\nhad submitted the lecture to any one but yourself.\r\n\r\nIf there is any phrase in the lecture which you think likely to get you\r\ninto trouble, out it shall come or be modified in form.\r\n\r\nIf the whole thing is too much for the Dons' nerves--I am no judge of\r\ntheir delicacy--I am quite ready to give up the lecture.\r\n\r\nIn fact I do not know whether I shall be able to make myself heard\r\nthree weeks hence, as the influenza has left its mark in hoarseness and\r\npain in the throat after speaking.\r\n\r\nSo you see if the thing is altogether too wicked there is an easy way\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, April 28, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nMy mind is made easy by such a handsome acquittal from you and the Lady\r\nAbbess, your coadjutor in the Holy Office.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who is my inquisitor and confessor in ordinary, has gone over\r\nthe lecture twice, without scenting a heresy, and if she and Mrs.\r\nRomanes fail--a fico for a mere male don's nose!\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the complete argument, I agree with you about\r\nnote 19. But the dangers of open collision with orthodoxy on the one\r\nhand and Spencer on the other, increased with the square of the\r\nenlargement of the final pages, and I was most anxious for giving no\r\nhandle to any one who might like to say I had used the lecture for\r\npurposes of attack. Moreover, in spite of all reduction, the lecture is\r\ntoo long already.\r\n\r\nBut I think it not improbable that in spite of my meekness and\r\npeacefulness, neither the one side nor the other will let me alone. And\r\nthen you see, I shall have an opportunity of making things plain, under\r\nno restriction. You will not be responsible for anything said in the\r\nsecond edition, nor can the Donniest of Dons grumble.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nThe double negative is Shakspearian. See Hamlet, act 2 scene 2.\r\n\r\n[Unfortunately for the entire success of the lecture, he was suffering\r\nfrom the results of influenza, more especially a loss of voice. He\r\nwrites (April 18):--]\r\n\r\nAfter getting through the winter successfully I have had the\r\nill-fortune to be seized with influenza. I believe I must have got it\r\nfrom the microbes haunting some of the three hundred doctors at the\r\nVirchow dinner. [On the 16th March.]\r\n\r\nI had next to no symptoms except debility, and though I am much better\r\nI cannot quite shake that off. As usual with me it affects my voice. I\r\nhope this will get right before this day month, but I expect I shall\r\nhave to nurse it. I do not want to interfere with any of your\r\nhospitable plans, and I think if you will ensure me quiet on the\r\nmorning of the 18th (I understand the lecture is in the afternoon) it\r\nwill suffice. After the thing is over I am ready for anything from\r\npitch and toss onwards.\r\n\r\n[Two more letters dated before the 18th of May touch on the\r\ncircumstances of the lecture. One is to his son-in-law, John Collier;\r\nthe other to his old friend Tyndall, the last he ever wrote him, and\r\ncontaining a cheery reference to the advance of old age.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, May 9, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Jack,\r\n\r\n...M-- is better, and I am getting my voice back. But may St.\r\nErnulphus' curse descend on influenza microbes! They tried to work\r\ntheir way out at my nose, and converted me into a disreputable Captain\r\nCostigan-looking person ten days ago. Now they are working at my lips.\r\n\r\nFor the credit of the family I hope I shall be more reputable by the\r\n18th.\r\n\r\nI hope you will appreciate my dexterity. The lecture is a regular\r\negg-dance. That I should discourse on Ethics to the University of\r\nOxford and say all I want to say, without a word anybody can quarrel\r\nwith, is decidedly the most piquant occurrence in my career...\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately, Pater.\r\n\r\nTo Professor Tyndall.\r\n\r\nP.S. to be read first.\r\n\r\nEastbourne, May 15, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Tyndall,\r\n\r\nThere are not many apples (and those mostly of the crab sort) left upon\r\nthe old tree, but I send you the product of the last shaking. Please\r\nkeep it out of any hands but your wife's and yours till Thursday, when\r\nI am to \"stand and deliver\" it, if I have voice enough, which is\r\ndoubtful. The sequelae of influenza in my case have been mostly pimples\r\nand procrastination, the former largely on my nose, so that I have been\r\na spectacle. Besides these, loss of voice. The pimples are mostly gone\r\nand the procrastination is not much above normal, but what will happen\r\nwhen I try to fill the Sheldonian Theatre is very doubtful.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought thirty-three years ago, when the great \"Sammy\"\r\nfight came off, that the next time I should speak at Oxford would be in\r\nsuccession to Gladstone, on \"Evolution and Ethics\" as an invited\r\nlecturer?\r\n\r\nThere was something so quaint about the affair that I really could not\r\nresist, though the wisdom of putting so much strain on my creaky\r\ntimbers is very questionable. Mind you wish me well through it at 2.30\r\non Thursday.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have better news of you. As to dying by inches, that is\r\nwhat we are all doing, my dear old fellow; the only thing is to\r\nestablish a proper ratio between inch and time. Eight years ago I had\r\ngood reason to say the same thing of myself, but my inch has lengthened\r\nout in a most extraordinary way. Still I confess we are getting older;\r\nand my dear wife has been greatly shaken by repeated attacks of violent\r\npain which seizes her quite unexpectedly. I am always glad, both on her\r\naccount and my own, to get back into the quiet and good air here as\r\nfast as possible, and in another year or two, if I live so long, I\r\nshall clear out of all engagements that take me away...\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nNOT TO BE ANSWERED, and you had better get Mrs. Tyndall to read it to\r\nyou or you will say naughty words about the scrawl.\r\n\r\n[Sanguine as he had resolved to be about the recovery of his voice, his\r\nfear lest \"1000 out of the 2000 won't hear\" was very near realisation.\r\nThe Sheldonian Theatre was thronged before he appeared on the platform,\r\na striking presence in his D.C.L. robes, and looking very leonine with\r\nhis silvery gray hair sweeping back in one long wave from his forehead,\r\nand the rugged squareness of his features tempered by the benignity of\r\nan old age which has seen much and overcome much. He read the lecture\r\nfrom a printed copy, not venturing, as he would have liked, upon the\r\nsevere task of speaking it from memory, considering its length and the\r\nimportance of preserving the exact wording. He began in a somewhat low\r\ntone, nursing his voice for the second half of the discourse. From the\r\nmore distant parts of the theatre came several cries of \"speak up\"; and\r\nafter a time a rather disturbing migration of eager undergraduates\r\nbegan from the galleries to the body of the hall. The latter part was\r\nindeed more audible than the first; still a number of the audience were\r\ndisappointed in hearing imperfectly. However, the lecture had a large\r\nsale; the first edition of 2000 was exhausted by the end of the month;\r\nand another 700 in the next ten days.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Oxford, and paying a pleasant visit to one of the\r\nFannings (his wife's nephew) at Tew, Huxley intended to visit another\r\nof the family, Mrs. Crowder, in Lincolnshire, but on reaching London\r\nfound himself dead beat, and had to retire to Eastbourne, whence he\r\nwrites to Sir M. Foster and to Mr. Romanes.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, May 26, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nYour letter has been following me about. I had not got rid of my\r\ninfluenza at Oxford, so the exertion and the dinner parties together\r\nplayed the deuce with me.\r\n\r\nWe had got so far as the Great Northern Hotel on our way to some\r\nconnections in Lincolnshire, when I had to give it up and retreat here\r\nto begin convalescing again.\r\n\r\nI do not feel sure of coming to the Harvey affair after all. But if I\r\ndo, it will be alone, and I think I had better accept the hospitality\r\nof the college; which will by no means be so jolly as Shelford, but\r\nprobably more prudent, considering the necessity of dining out.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, my dear friend, I am getting old.\r\n\r\nI am very sorry to hear you have been doing your influenza also. It's a\r\nbeastly thing, as I have it, no symptoms except going flop.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nNobody sees that the lecture is a very orthodox production on the text\r\n(if there is such a one), \"Satan the Prince of this world.\"\r\n\r\nI think the remnant of influenza microbes must have held a meeting in\r\nmy corpus after the lecture, and resolved to reconquer the territory.\r\nBut I mean to beat the brutes.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be interested,\" [he writes to Mr. Romanes,] \"in the article on\r\nthe lecture. The papers have been asinine.\" This was an article which\r\nMr. Romanes had told him was about to appear in the \"Oxford Magazine\".\r\nAnd on the 30th he writes again.]\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the \"Oxford Magazine\". The writer of the article is\r\nabout the only critic I have met with yet who understands my drift. My\r\nwife says it is a \"sensible\" article, but her classification is a very\r\nsimple one--sensible articles are those that contain praise, \"stupid\"\r\nthose that show insensibility to my merits!\r\n\r\nReally I thought it very sensible, without regard to the plums in the\r\npudding.\r\n\r\n[But the criticism, \"sensible\" not merely in the humorous sense, which\r\nhe most fully appreciated was that of Professor Seth, in a lecture\r\nentitled \"Man and Nature.\" He wrote to him on October 27:--]\r\n\r\nDear Professor Seth,\r\n\r\nA report of your lecture on \"Man and Nature\" has just reached me.\r\nAccept my cordial thanks for defending me, and still more for\r\nunderstanding me.\r\n\r\nI really have been unable to understand what my critics have been\r\ndreaming of when they raise the objection that the ethical process\r\nbeing part of the cosmic process cannot be opposed to it.\r\n\r\nThey might as well say that artifice does not oppose nature, because it\r\nis part of nature in the broadest sense.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is one of the conditions of the \"Romanes Lecture\" that no\r\nallusion shall be made to religion or politics. I had to make my\r\nomelette without breaking any of those eggs, and the task was not easy.\r\n\r\nThe prince of scientific expositors, Faraday, was once asked, \"How much\r\nmay a popular lecturer suppose his audience knows?\" He replied\r\nemphatically, \"NOTHING.\" Mine was not exactly a popular audience, but I\r\nought not to have forgotten Faraday's rule.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[A letter of congratulation to Lord Farrer on his elevation to the\r\npeerage contains an ironical reference to the general tone of the\r\ncriticisms on his lecture:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, June 5, 1893.\r\n\r\nCI DEVANT CITOYEN PETION (autrefois le vertueux),\r\n\r\nYou have lost all chance of leading the forces of the County Council to\r\nthe attack of the Horse-Guards.\r\n\r\nYou will become an emigre, and John Burns will have to content himself\r\nwith the heads of the likes of me. As the Jacobins said of Lavoisier,\r\nthe Republic has no need of men of science.\r\n\r\nBut this prospect need not interfere with sending our hearty\r\ncongratulations to Lady Farrer and yourself.\r\n\r\nAs for your criticisms, don't you know that I am become a reactionary\r\nand secret friend of the clerics?\r\n\r\nMy lecture is really an effort to put the Christian doctrine that Satan\r\nis the Prince of this world upon a scientific foundation.\r\n\r\nJust consider it in this light, and you will understand why I was so\r\nwarmly welcomed in Oxford. (N.B.--The only time I spoke before was in\r\n1860, when the great row with Samuel came off!!)\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, July 15, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Skelton,\r\n\r\nI fear I must admit that even a Gladstonian paper occasionally tells\r\nthe truth. They never mean to, but we all have our lapses from the rule\r\nof life we have laid down for ourselves, and must be charitable.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I got influenza in the spring, and have never managed to\r\nshake right again, any tendency that way being well counteracted by the\r\nRomanes lecture and its accompaniments.\r\n\r\nSo we are off to the Maloja to-morrow. It mended up the shaky old\r\nheart-pump five years ago, and I hope will again.\r\n\r\nI have been in Orkney, and believe in the air, but I cannot say quite\r\nso much for the scenery. I thought it just a wee little bit, shall I\r\nsay, bare? But then I have a passion for mountains.\r\n\r\nI shall be right glad to know what your H.O.M. [The \"Old Man of Hoy,\" a\r\npseudonym under which Sir J. Skelton wrote.] has to say about Ethics\r\nand Evolution. You must remember that my lecture was a kind of\r\negg-dance. Good manners bound me over to say nothing offensive to the\r\nChristians in the amphitheatre (I was in the arena), and truthfulness,\r\non the other hand, bound me to say nothing that I did not fully mean.\r\nUnder these circumstances one has to leave a great many i's undotted\r\nand t's uncrossed.\r\n\r\nPray remember me very kindly to Mrs. Skelton, and believe me,\r\n\r\nYours ever,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[And again on October 17:--]\r\n\r\nAsk your Old Man of Hoy to be so good as to suspend judgment until the\r\nLecture appears again with an appendix in that collection of volumes\r\nthe bulk of which appals me.\r\n\r\nDidn't I see somewhere that you had been made Poor Law pope, or\r\nsomething of the sort? I congratulate the poor more than I do you, for\r\nit must be a weary business trying to mend the irremediable. (No, I am\r\nNOT glancing at the whitewashing of Mary.)\r\n\r\n[Here may be added two later letters bearing in part upon the same\r\nsubject:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 23, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI ought to have thanked you before now for your letter about\r\nNietzsche's works, but I have not much working time, and I find\r\nletter-writing a burden, which I am always trying to shirk.\r\n\r\nI will look up Nietzsche, though I must confess that the profit I\r\nobtain from German authors on speculative questions is not usually\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nAs men of research in positive science they are magnificently laborious\r\nand accurate. But most of them have no notion of style, and seem to\r\ncompose their books with a pitchfork.\r\n\r\nThere are two very different questions which people fail to\r\ndiscriminate. One is whether evolution accounts for morality, the other\r\nwhether the principle of evolution in general can be adopted as an\r\nethical principle.\r\n\r\nThe first, of course, I advocate, and have constantly insisted upon.\r\nThe second I deny, and reject all so-called evolutional ethics based\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nI am yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nThomas Common, Esq.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, August 31, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Seth,\r\n\r\nI have come to a stop in the issue of my essays for the present, and I\r\nventure to ask your acceptance of the set which I have desired my\r\npublishers to send you.\r\n\r\nI hope that at present you are away somewhere, reading novels or\r\notherwise idling, in whatever may be your pet fashion.\r\n\r\nBut some day I want you to read the \"Prolegomena\" to the reprinted\r\nRomanes Lecture.\r\n\r\nLately I have been re-reading Spinoza (much read and little understood\r\nin my youth).\r\n\r\nBut that noblest of Jews must have planted no end of germs in my\r\nbrains, for I see that what I have to say is in principle what he had\r\nto say, in modern language.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following letters with reference to the long unfinished memoir on\r\n\"Spirula\" for the \"Challenger\" reports tell their own story. Huxley was\r\nvery glad to find some competent person to finish the work which his\r\nillness had incapacitated him from completing himself. It had been a\r\nburden on his conscience; and now he gladly put all his plates and\r\nexperience at the disposal of Professor Pelseneer, though he had\r\nnothing written and would not write anything. He had no wish to claim\r\neven joint authorship for the completed paper; when the question was\r\nfirst raised, he desired merely that it should be stated that such and\r\nsuch drawings were made by him; but when Professor Pelseneer insisted\r\nthat both names should appear as joint authors, he consented to this\r\nsolution of the question.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, September 17, 1893.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Murray [Now K.C.B. Director of the \"Reports of the\r\n'Challenger'.\"],\r\n\r\nIf the plates of Spirula could be turned to account a great burthen\r\nwould be taken off my mind.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pelseneer is every way competent to do justice to the\r\nsubject; and he has just what I needed, namely another specimen to\r\ncheck and complete the work; and besides that, the physical capacity\r\nfor dissection and close observation, of which I have had nothing left\r\nsince my long illness.\r\n\r\nWill you be so good as to tell Professor Pelseneer that I shall be glad\r\nto place the plates at his disposal and to give him all the\r\nexplanations I can of the drawings, whenever it may suit his\r\nconvenience to take up the work?\r\n\r\nNothing beyond mere fragments remained of the specimen.\r\n\r\nI am, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI return Pelseneer's letter.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, September 30, 1893.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Pelseneer,\r\n\r\nI send herewith (by this post) a full explanation of the plates of\r\nSpirula (including those of which you have unlettered copies). I trust\r\nyou will not be too much embarrassed by my bad handwriting, which is a\r\nplague to myself as well as to other people.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that you will be good enough to consider these figures as\r\nmaterials placed in your hands, to be made useful in the memoir on\r\nSpirula, which I trust you will draw up, supplying the defects of my\r\nwork and checking its accuracy.\r\n\r\nYou will observe that a great deal remains to be done. The muscular\r\nsystem is untouched; the structure and nature of the terminal\r\ncircumvallate papilla have to be made out; the lingual teeth must be\r\nre-examined; and the characters of the male determined. If I recollect\r\nrightly, Owen published something about the last point.\r\n\r\nIf I can be of any service to you in any questions that arise, I shall\r\nbe very glad; but as I am putting the trouble of the work on your\r\nshoulders, I wish you to have the credit of it.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am concerned, all that is needful is to say that such and\r\nsuch drawings were made by me.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, October 12, 1893.\r\n\r\nDear Professor Pelseneer,\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear from you that the homology of the cephalopod\r\narms with the gasteropod foot is now generally admitted. When I\r\nadvocated that opinion in my memoir on the \"Morphology of the Cephalous\r\nMollusca,\" some forty years ago, it was thought a great heresy.\r\n\r\nAs to publication; I am quite willing to agree to whatever arrangement\r\nyou think desirable, so long as you are kind enough to take all trouble\r\n(but that of \"consulting physician\") off my shoulders. Perhaps putting\r\nboth names to the memoir, as you suggest, will be the best way. I\r\ncannot undertake to write anything, but if you think I can be of any\r\nuse as an adviser or critic, do not hesitate to demand my services.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H.

Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Not long after his return he received a letter from a certain G-- S--,\r\nwho wrote from Southampton detailing a number of observations he had\r\nmade upon the organisms to be seen with a magnifying glass in an\r\ninfusion of vegetable matter, and as \"an ignoramus,\" apologised for any\r\nappearance of conceit in so doing, while asking his advice as to the\r\nbest means of improving his scientific knowledge. Huxley was much\r\nstruck by the tone of the letter and the description of the\r\nexperiments, and he wrote back:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, November 9, 1893.\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nWe are all \"ignoramuses\" more or less--and cannot reproach one another.\r\nIf there were any sign of conceit in your letter, you would not get\r\nthis reply.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it pleases me. Your observations are quite accurate\r\nand clearly described--and to be accurate in observation and clear in\r\ndescription is the first step towards good scientific work.\r\n\r\nYou are seeing just what the first workers with the microscope saw a\r\ncouple of centuries ago.\r\n\r\nGet some such book as Carpenter's \"On the Microscope\" and you will see\r\nwhat it all means.\r\n\r\nAre there no science classes in Southampton? There used to be, and I\r\nsuppose is, a Hartley Institute.\r\n\r\nIf you want to consult books you cannot otherwise obtain, take this to\r\nthe librarian, give him my compliments, and say I should be very much\r\nobliged if he would help you.\r\n\r\nI am, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Great was Huxley's astonishment when he learned in reply that his\r\ncorrespondent was a casual dock labourer, and had but scanty hours of\r\nleisure in which to read and think and seek into the recesses of\r\nnature, while his means of observation consisted of a toy microscope\r\nbought for a shilling at a fair. Casting about for some means of\r\nlending the man a helping hand, he bethought him of the Science and Art\r\nDepartment, and wrote on December 30 to Sir J. Donnelly:--]\r\n\r\nThe Department has feelers all over England--has it any at Southampton?\r\nAnd if it has, could it find out something about the writer of the\r\nletters I enclose? For a \"casual docker\" they are remarkable; and I\r\nthink when you have read them you will not mind my bothering you with\r\nthem. (I really have had the grace to hesitate.)\r\n\r\nI have been puzzled what to do for the man. It is so much easier to do\r\nharm than good by meddling--and yet I don't like to leave him to\r\n\"casual docking.\"\r\n\r\nIn that first letter he has got--on his own hook--about as far as\r\nBuffon and Needham 150 years ago.\r\n\r\nAnd later to Professor Howes:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 12, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Howes,\r\n\r\nBest thanks for unearthing the volumes of Milne-Edwards. I was afraid\r\nmy set was spoiled.\r\n\r\nI shall be still more obliged to you if you can hear of something for\r\nS--. There is a right good parson in his neighbourhood, and from what\r\nhe tells me about S-- I am confirmed in my opinion that he is a very\r\nexceptional man, who ought to be at something better than porter's work\r\nfor twelve hours a day.\r\n\r\nThe mischief is that one never knows how transplanting a tree, much\r\nless a man, will answer. Playing Providence is a game at which one is\r\nvery apt to burn one's fingers.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am going to try, and hope at any rate to do no harm to the\r\nman I want to help.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[He was eventually offered more congenial occupation at the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in South Kensington, but preferred not to enter into the\r\nbonds of an unaccustomed office.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, through Sir John Donnelly, Huxley was placed in\r\ncommunication with the Reverend Montague Powell, who, at his request,\r\ncalled upon the docker; and finding him a man who had read and thought\r\nto an astonishing extent upon scientific problems, and had a\r\nconsiderable acquaintance with English literature, soon took more than\r\na vicarious interest in him. Mr. Powell, who kept Huxley informed of\r\nhis talks and correspondence with G.S., gives a full account of the\r\ncircumstances in a letter to the \"Spectator\" of July 13, 1895, from\r\nwhich I quote the following words:--\r\n\r\nThe Professor's object in writing was to ask me how best such a man\r\ncould be helped, I being at his special request the intermediary. So I\r\nsuggested in the meanwhile a microscope and a few scientific books. In\r\nthe course of a few days I received a splendid achromatic compound\r\nmicroscope and some books, which I duly handed over to my friend,\r\ntelling him it was from an unknown hand. \"Ah,\" he said, \"I know who\r\nthat must be; it can be no other than the greatest of living\r\nscientists; it is just like him to help a tyro.\"\r\n\r\nOne small incident of this affair is perhaps worth preserving as an\r\nexample of Huxley's love of a bantering repartee. In the midst of the\r\ncorrespondence Mr. Powell seems suddenly to have been seized by an\r\nuneasy recollection that Huxley had lately received some honour or\r\ntitle, so he next addressed him as \"My dear Sir Thomas.\" The latter,\r\nnot to be outdone, promptly replied with] \"My dear Lord Bishop of the\r\nSolent.\"\r\n\r\n[About the same time comes a letter to Mr. Knowles, based upon a\r\nparagraph from the gossiping column of some newspaper which had come\r\ninto Huxley's hands:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 9, 1893.\r\n\r\nGossip of the Town.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Huxley receives 200 guineas for each of his articles for the\r\n'Nineteenth Century'.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI have always been satisfied with the \"Nineteenth Century\" in the\r\ncapacity of paymaster, but I did not know how much reason I had for my\r\nsatisfaction till I read the above!\r\n\r\nTotting up the number of articles and multiplying by 200 it strikes me\r\nI shall be behaving very handsomely if I take 2000 pounds for the\r\nbalance due.\r\n\r\nSo sit down quickly, take thy cheque-book, and write five score, and\r\nlet me have it at breakfast time to-morrow. I once got a cheque for\r\n1000 pounds at breakfast, and it ruined me morally. I have always been\r\nlooking out for another.\r\n\r\nI hope you are all flourishing. We are the better for Maloja, but more\r\ndependent on change of weather and other trifles than could be wished.\r\nYet I find myself outlasting those who started in life along with me.\r\nPoor Andrew Clark and I were at Haslar together in 1846, and he was the\r\nyounger by a year and a half.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nAll my time is spent in the co-ordination of my eruptions when I am an\r\nactive volcano.\r\n\r\nI hope you got the volumes which I told Macmillan to send you.\r\n\r\n[The following letter to Professor Romanes, whose failing eyesight was\r\na premonitory symptom of the disease which proved fatal the next year,\r\nreads, so to say, as a solemn prelude to the death of three old friends\r\nthis autumn--of Andrew Clark, his old comrade at Haslar, and cheery\r\nphysician for many years; of Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol, whose\r\nacquaintance he had first made in 1851 at the Stanleys' at Harrow, and\r\nwith whom he kept up an intimacy to the end of his life, visiting\r\nBalliol once or twice every year; and, heaviest blow, of John Tyndall,\r\nthe friend and comrade whose genial warmth of spirit made him almost\r\nclaim a brother's place in early struggles and later success, and whose\r\nsudden death was all the more poignant for the cruel touch of tragedy\r\nin the manner of it.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, September 28, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Romanes,\r\n\r\nWe are very much grieved to hear such a bad account of your health.\r\nWould that we could achieve something more to the purpose than assuring\r\nyou and Mrs. Romanes of our hearty sympathy with you both in your\r\ntroubles. I assure you, you are much in our thoughts, which are sad\r\nenough with the news of Jowett's, I fear, fatal attack.\r\n\r\nI am almost ashamed to be well and tolerably active when young and old\r\nfriends are being thus prostrated.\r\n\r\nHowever, you have youth on your side, so do not give up, and wearisome\r\nas doing nothing may be, persist in it as the best of medicines.\r\n\r\nAt my time of life one should be always ready to stand at attention\r\nwhen the order to march comes; but for the rest I think it well to go\r\non doing what I can, as if F. M. General Death had forgotten me. That\r\nmust account for my seeming presumption in thinking I may some day\r\n\"take up the threads\" of late evolutionary speculation.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nMy wife joins with me in love and kind wishes to you both.\r\n\r\n[At the request of his friends, Huxley wrote for the \"Nineteenth\r\nCentury\" a brief appreciation of his old comrade Tyndall--the tribute\r\nof a friend to a friend--and, difficult task though it was, touched on\r\nthe closing scene, if only from a chivalrous desire to do justice to\r\nthe long devotion which accident had so cruelly wronged:--]\r\n\r\nI am comforted [he writes to Sir J. Hooker on January 3] by your liking\r\nthe Tyndall article. You are quite right, I shivered over the episode\r\nof the \"last words,\" but it struck me as the best way of getting\r\njustice done to her, so I took a header. I am glad to see by the\r\nnewspaper comments that it does not seem to have shocked other people's\r\nsense of decency.\r\n\r\n[The funeral took place on Saturday, December 9. There was no storm nor\r\nfog to make the graveside perilous for the survivors. In the Haslemere\r\nchurchyard the winter sun shone its brightest, and the moorland air was\r\ncrisp with an almost Alpine freshness as this lover of the mountains\r\nwas carried to his last resting-place. But though he took no outward\r\nharm from that bright still morning, Huxley was greatly shaken by the\r\nevent]: \"I was very much used up,\" [he writes to Sir M. Foster on his\r\nreturn home two days later], \"to my shame be it said, far more than my\r\nwife\"; [and on December 30 to Sir John Donnelly:--]\r\n\r\nYour kind letter deserved better than to have been left all this time\r\nwithout response, but the fact is, I came to grief the day after\r\nChristmas Day (no, we did NOT indulge in too much champagne). Lost my\r\nvoice, and collapsed generally, without any particular reason, so I\r\nwent to bed and stayed there as long as I could stand it, and now I am\r\npicking up again. The fact is, I suppose I had been running up a little\r\naccount over poor old Tyndall. One does not stand that sort of wear and\r\ntear so well as one gets ancient.\r\n\r\n[On the same day he writes to Sir J.D. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, December 30, 1893.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nYou gave the geographers some uncommonly sane advice. I observe that\r\nthe words about the \"stupendous ice-clad mountains\" you saw were hardly\r\nout of your mouth when -- coolly asserts that the Antarctic continent\r\nis a table-land! \"comparatively level country.\" It really is wrong that\r\nmen should be allowed to go about loose who fill you with such a strong\r\ndesire to kick them as that little man does.\r\n\r\nI send herewith a spare copy of \"Nineteenth\" with my paper about\r\nTyndall. It is not exactly what I could wish, as I was hurried over it,\r\nand knocked up into the bargain, but I have tried to give a fair view\r\nof him. Tell me what you think of it.\r\n\r\nI have been having a day or two on the sick list. Nothing discernible\r\nthe matter, only flopped, as I did in the spring. However, I am picking\r\nup again. The fact is, I have never any blood pressure to spare, and a\r\nsmall thing humbugs the pump.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have some kicks left in me, vide the preface to the fourth\r\nvolume of Essays; ditto Number 5 when that appears in February.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear old friend, take care of yourself in the coming year '94.\r\nI'll stand by you as long as the fates will let me, and you must be\r\nequally \"Johnnie.\" With our love to Lady Hooker and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.13.\r\n\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n[The completion early in 1894 of the ninth volume of \"Collected Essays\"\r\nwas followed by a review of them in \"Nature\" (February 1), from the pen\r\nof Professor Ray Lankester, emphasising the way in which the writer's\r\npersonality appears throughout the writing:--\r\n\r\nThere is probably no lover of apt discourse, of keen criticism, or of\r\nscientific doctrine who will not welcome the issue of Professor\r\nHuxley's \"Essays\" in the present convenient shape. For my own part, I\r\nknow of no writing which by its mere form, even apart from the supreme\r\ninterest of the matters with which it mostly deals, gives me so much\r\npleasure as that of the author of these essays. In his case, more than\r\nthat of his contemporaries, it is strictly true that the style is the\r\nman. Some authors we may admire for the consummate skill with which\r\nthey transfer to the reader their thought without allowing him, even\r\nfor a moment, to be conscious of their personality. In Professor\r\nHuxley's work, on the other hand, we never miss his fascinating\r\npresence; now he is gravely shaking his head, now compressing the lips\r\nwith emphasis, and from time to time, with a quiet twinkle of the eye,\r\nmaking unexpected apologies or protesting that he is of a modest and\r\npeace-loving nature. At the same time, one becomes accustomed to a rare\r\nand delightful phenomenon. Everything which has entered the author's\r\nbrain by eye or ear, whether of recondite philosophy, biological fact,\r\nor political programme, comes out again to us--clarified, sifted,\r\narranged, and vivified by its passage through the logical machine of\r\nhis strong individuality.\r\n\r\nOf the artist in him it continues:--\r\n\r\nHe deals with form not only as a mechanical engineer in partibus\r\n(Huxley's own description of himself), but also as an artist, a born\r\nlover of forms, a character which others recognise in him though he\r\ndoes not himself set it down in his analysis.\r\n\r\nThe essay on \"Animal Automatism\" suggested a reminiscence of Professor\r\nLankester's as to the way in which it was delivered, and this in turn\r\nled to Huxley's own account of the incident in the letter given in\r\nvolume 2.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time there is a letter acknowledging Mr. Bateson's book\r\n\"On Variation\", which is interesting as touching on the latter-day\r\nhabit of speculation apart from fact which had begun to prevail in\r\nbiology:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, February 20, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Bateson,\r\n\r\nI have put off thanking you for the volume \"On Variation\" which you\r\nhave been so good as to send me in the hope that I should be able to\r\nlook into it before doing so.\r\n\r\nBut as I find that impossible, beyond a hasty glance, at present, I\r\nmust content myself with saying how glad I am to see from that glance\r\nthat we are getting back from the region of speculation into that of\r\nfact again.\r\n\r\nThere have been threatenings of late that the field of battle of\r\nEvolution was being transferred to Nephelococcygia.\r\n\r\nI see you are inclined to advocate the possibility of considerable\r\n\"saltus\" on the part of Dame Nature in her variations. I always took\r\nthe same view, much to Mr. Darwin's disgust, and we used often to\r\ndebate it.\r\n\r\nIf you should come across my article in the \"Westminster\" (1860) you\r\nwill find a paragraph on that question near the end. I am writing to\r\nMacmillan to send you the volume.\r\n\r\nYours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nBy the way, have you ever considered this point, that the variations of\r\nwhich breeders avail themselves are exactly those which occur when the\r\npreviously wild stocks are subjected to exactly the same conditions?\r\n\r\n[The rest of the first half of the year is not eventful. As\r\nillustrating the sort of communications which constantly came to him, I\r\nquote from a letter to Sir J. Donnelly, of January 11:--]\r\n\r\nI had a letter from a fellow yesterday morning who must be a lunatic,\r\nto the effect that he had been reading my essays, thought I was just\r\nthe man to spend a month with, and was coming down by the five o'clock\r\ntrain, attended by his seven children and his MOTHER-IN-LAW!\r\n\r\nFrost being over, there was lots of boiling water ready for him, but he\r\ndid not turn up!\r\n\r\nWife and servants expected nothing less than assassination.\r\n\r\n[Later he notes with dismay an invitation as a Privy Councillor to a\r\nState evening party:--]\r\n\r\nIt is at 10.30 P.M., just the time this poor old septuagenarian goes to\r\nbed!\r\n\r\nMy swellness is an awful burden, for as it is I am going to dine with\r\nthe Prime Minister on Saturday.\r\n\r\n[The banquet with the Prime Minister here alluded to was the occasion\r\nof a brief note of apology to Lord Rosebery for having unintentionally\r\nkept him waiting:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, May 28, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Lord Rosebery,\r\n\r\nI had hoped that my difficulties in dealing with an overtight scabbard\r\nstud, as we sat down to dinner on Saturday had inconvenienced no one\r\nbut myself, until it flashed across my mind after I had parted from you\r\nthat, as you had observed them, it was only too probable that I had the\r\nmisfortune to keep you waiting.\r\n\r\nI have been in a state of permanent blush ever since, and I feel sure\r\nyou will forgive me for troubling you with this apology as the only\r\nremedy to which I can look for relief from that unwonted affliction.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Lord Rosebery, yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[All through the spring he had been busy completing the chapter on Sir\r\nRichard Owen's work, which he had been asked to write by the biographer\r\nof his old opponent, and on February 4 tells Sir J.D. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nI am toiling over my chapter about Owen, and I believe his ghost in\r\nHades is grinning over my difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe thing that strikes me most is, how he and I and all the things we\r\nfought about belong to antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impertinent to trouble the modern world with such\r\nantiquarian business.\r\n\r\n[He sent the manuscript to Sir M. Foster on June 16; the book itself\r\nappeared in December. The chapter in question was restricted to a\r\nreview of the immense amount of work, most valuable on its positive\r\nside, done by Owen (compare the letter of January 18, 1893.); and the\r\nreview in \"Nature\" remarks of it that the criticism is \"so\r\nstraightforward, searching, and honest as to leave nothing further to\r\nbe desired.\"\r\n\r\nBesides this piece of work, he had written early in the year a few\r\nlines on the general character of the nineteenth century, in reply to a\r\nrequest, addressed to \"the most illustrious children of the century,\"\r\nfor their opinion as to what name will be given to it by an impartial\r\nposterity--the century of Comte, of Darwin or Renan, of Edison,\r\nPasteur, or Gladstone. He replied:--]\r\n\r\nI conceive that the leading characteristic of the nineteenth century\r\nhas been the rapid growth of the scientific spirit, the consequent\r\napplication of scientific methods of investigation to all the problems\r\nwith which the human mind is occupied, and the correlative rejection of\r\ntraditional beliefs which have proved their incompetence to bear such\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the scientific spirit has been manifested in every\r\nregion of speculation and of practice.\r\n\r\nMany of the eminent men you mention have been its effective organs in\r\ntheir several departments.\r\n\r\nBut the selection of any one of these, whatever his merits, as an\r\nadequate representative of the power and majesty of the scientific\r\nspirit of the age would be a grievous mistake.\r\n\r\nScience reckons many prophets, but there is not even a promise of a\r\nMessiah.\r\n\r\n[The unexampled increase in the expenditure of the European states upon\r\ntheir armaments led the Arbitration Alliance this year to issue a\r\nmemorial urging the Government to co-operate with other Governments in\r\nreducing naval and military burdens. Huxley was asked to sign this\r\nmemorial, and replied to the secretary as follows:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, June 21, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI have taken some time to consider the memorial to which you have\r\ncalled my attention, and I regret that I do not find myself able to\r\nsign it.\r\n\r\nNot that I have the slightest doubt about the magnitude of the evils\r\nwhich accrue from the steady increase of European armaments; but\r\nbecause I think that this regrettable fact is merely the superficial\r\nexpression of social forces, the operation of which cannot be sensibly\r\naffected by agreements between Governments.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it is a delusion to attribute the growth of armaments to\r\nthe \"exactions of militarism.\" The \"exactions of industrialism,\"\r\ngenerated by international commercial competition, may, I believe,\r\nclaim a much larger share in prompting that growth. Add to this the\r\nFrench thirst for revenge, the most just determination of the German\r\nand Italian peoples to assert their national unity; the Russian\r\nPanslavonic fanaticism and desire for free access to the western seas;\r\nthe Papacy steadily fishing in the troubled waters for the means of\r\nrecovering its lost (I hope for ever lost) temporal possessions and\r\nspiritual supremacy; the \"sick man,\" kept alive only because each of\r\nhis doctors is afraid of the other becoming his heir.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the intensity of the perturbing agencies which arise\r\nout of these and other conditions of modern European society, I confess\r\nthat the attempt to counteract them by asking Governments to agree to a\r\nmaximum military expenditure, does not appear to me to be worth making;\r\nindeed I think it might do harm by leading people to suppose that the\r\ndesires of Governments are the chief agents in determining whether\r\npeace or war shall obtain in Europe.\r\n\r\nI am, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Later in the year, on August 8, took place the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Oxford, noteworthy for the presidential address\r\ndelivered by Lord Salisbury, Chancellor of the University, in which the\r\ndoctrine of evolution was \"enunciated as a matter of course--disputed\r\nby no reasonable man,\"--although accompanied by a description of the\r\nworking of natural selection and variation which appeared to the man of\r\nscience a mere travesty of these doctrines.\r\n\r\nHuxley had been persuaded to attend this meeting, the more willingly,\r\nperhaps, since his reception at Oxford the year before suggested that\r\nthere would be a special piquancy in the contrast between this and the\r\nlast meeting of the Association at Oxford in 1860. He was not\r\ndisappointed. Details apart, the cardinal situation was reversed. The\r\ngenius of the place had indeed altered. The representatives of the\r\nparty, whose prophet had once contemptuously come here to anathematise\r\nthe \"Origin\", returned at length to the same spot to admit--if not\r\naltogether ungrudgingly--the greatness of the work accomplished by\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nOnce under promise to go, he could not escape without the \"few words\"\r\nwhich he now found so tiring; but he took the part which assured him\r\ngreatest freedom, as seconder of the vote of thanks to the president\r\nfor his address. The study of an advance copy of the address raised an]\r\n\"almost overwhelming temptation\" [to criticise certain statements\r\ncontained in it; but this would have been out of place in seconding a\r\nvote of thanks; and resisting the temptation, he only] \"conveyed\r\ncriticism,\" [as he writes to Professor Lewis Campbell], \"in the form of\r\npraise\": [going so far as to suggest] \"it might be that, in listening\r\nto the deeply interesting address of the President, a thought had\r\noccasionally entered his mind how rich and profitable might be the\r\ndiscussion of that paper in Section D\" (Biology). [It was not exactly\r\nan offhand speech. Writing to Sir M. Foster for any good report which\r\nmight appear in an Oxford paper, he says:--]\r\n\r\nI have no notes of it. I wrote something on Tuesday night, but this\r\ndraft is no good, as it was metamorphosed two or three times over on\r\nWednesday.\r\n\r\n[One who was present and aware of the whole situation once described\r\nhow he marked the eyes of another interested member of the audience,\r\nwho knew that Huxley was to speak, but not what he meant to say,\r\nturning anxiously whenever the president reached a critical phrase in\r\nthe address, to see how he would take it. But the expression of his\r\nface told nothing; only those who knew him well could infer a\r\nsuppressed impatience from a little twitching of his foot.\r\n\r\nOf this occasion Professor Henry F. Osborn, one of his old pupils,\r\nwrites in his \"Memorial Tribute to Thomas H. Huxley\" (\"Transactions of\r\nthe N.Y. Acad. Society\" volume 15):--\r\n\r\nHuxley's last public appearance was at the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation at Oxford. He had been very urgently invited to attend,\r\nfor, exactly a quarter of a century before, the Association had met at\r\nOxford, and Huxley had had his famous encounter with Bishop\r\nWilberforce. It was felt that the anniversary would be an historic one,\r\nand incomplete without his presence, and so it proved to be. Huxley's\r\nespecial duty was to second the vote of thanks for the Marquis of\r\nSalisbury's address--one of the invariable formalities of the opening\r\nmeetings of the Association. The meeting proved to be the greatest one\r\nin the history of the Association. The Sheldonian Theatre was packed\r\nwith one of the most distinguished scientific audiences ever brought\r\ntogether, and the address of the Marquis was worthy of the occasion.\r\nThe whole tenor of it was the unknown in science. Passing from the\r\nunsolved problems of astronomy, chemistry, and physics, he came to\r\nbiology. With delicate irony he spoke of the] \"COMFORTING WORD,\r\nEVOLUTION,\" [and passing to the Weismannian controversy, implied that\r\nthe diametrically opposed views so frequently expressed nowadays threw\r\nthe whole process of evolution into doubt. It was only too evident that\r\nthe Marquis himself found no comfort in evolution, and even entertained\r\na suspicion as to its probability. It was well worth the whole journey\r\nto Oxford to watch Huxley during this portion of the address. In his\r\nred doctor-of-laws gown, placed upon his shoulders by the very body of\r\nmen who had once referred to him as \"a Mr. Huxley\" (This phrase was\r\nactually used by the \"Times\".), he sank deeper into his chair upon the\r\nvery front of the platform and restlessly tapped his foot. His\r\nsituation was an unenviable one. He had to thank an ex-Prime Minister\r\nof England and present Chancellor of Oxford University for an address,\r\nthe sentiments of which were directly against those he himself had been\r\nmaintaining for twenty-five years. He said afterwards that when the\r\nproofs of the Marquis's address were put into his hands the day before,\r\nhe realised that he had before him a most delicate and difficult task.\r\nLord Kelvin (Sir William Thomson) one of the most distinguished living\r\nphysicists, first moved the vote of thanks, but his reception was\r\nnothing to the tremendous applause which greeted Huxley in the heart of\r\nthat University whose cardinal principles he had so long been opposing.\r\nConsiderable anxiety had been felt by his friends lest his voice should\r\nfail to fill the theatre, for it had signally failed during his Romanes\r\nLecture delivered in Oxford the year before, but when Huxley arose he\r\nreminded you of a venerable gladiator returning to the arena after\r\nyears of absence. He raised his figure and his voice to its full\r\nheight, and, with one foot turned over the edge of the step, veiled an\r\nunmistakable and vigorous protest in the most gracious and dignified\r\nspeech of thanks.\r\n\r\nThroughout the subsequent special sessions of this meeting Huxley could\r\nnot appear. He gave the impression of being aged but not infirm, and no\r\none realised that he had spoken his last word as champion of the law of\r\nevolution. (See, however, below.)\r\n\r\nSuch criticism of the address as he actually expressed reappears in the\r\nleading article, \"Past and Present,\" which he wrote for \"Nature\" to\r\ncelebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of its foundation (November 1,\r\n1894).\r\n\r\nThe essence of the criticism is that with whatever demonstrations of\r\nhostility to parts of the Darwinian theory Lord Salisbury covered the\r\nretreat of his party from their ancient positions, he admitted the\r\nvalidity of the main points for which Darwin contended.]\r\n\r\nThe essence of this great work (the \"Origin of Species\") may be stated\r\nsummarily thus: it affirms the mutability of species and the descent of\r\nliving forms, separated by differences of more than varietal value,\r\nfrom one stock. That is to say, it propounds the doctrine of evolution\r\nas far as biology is concerned. So far, we have merely a restatement of\r\na doctrine which, in its most general form, is as old as scientific\r\nspeculation. So far, we have the two theses which were declared to be\r\nscientifically absurd and theologically damnable by the Bishop of\r\nOxford in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nIt is also of these two fundamental doctrines that, at the meeting of\r\nthe British Association in 1894, the Chancellor of the University of\r\nOxford spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Another lasting and unquestioned effect has resulted from Darwin's\r\nwork. He has, as a matter of fact, disposed of the doctrine of the\r\nimmutability of species...\"\r\n\r\n\"Few now are found to doubt that animals separated by differences far\r\nexceeding those that distinguished what we know as species have yet\r\ndescended from common ancestors.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, every one conversant with the state of biological science\r\nis aware that general opinion has long had good reason for making the\r\nvolte face thus indicated. It is also mere justice to Darwin to say\r\nthat this \"lasting and unquestioned\" revolution is, in a very real\r\nsense, his work. And yet it is also true that, if all the conceptions\r\npromulgated in the \"Origin of Species\" which are peculiarly Darwinian\r\nwere swept away, the theory of the evolution of animals and plants\r\nwould not be in the slightest degree shaken.\r\n\r\n[The strain of this single effort was considerable] \"I am frightfully\r\ntired,\" [he wrote on August 11,] \"but the game was worth the candle.\"\r\n\r\n[Letters to Sir J.D. Hooker and to Professor Lewis Campbell contain his\r\nown account of the affair. The reference in the latter to the priests\r\nis in reply to Professor Campbell's story of one of Jowett's last\r\nsayings. They had been talking of the collective power of the\r\npriesthood to resist the introduction of new ideas; a long pause\r\nensued, and the old man seemed to have slipped off into a doze, when he\r\nsuddenly broke the silence by saying,] \"The priests will always be too\r\nmany for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Spa, Tunbridge Wells, August 12, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nI wish, as everybody wished, you had been with us on Wednesday evening\r\nat Oxford when we settled accounts for 1860, and got a receipt in full\r\nfrom the Chancellor of the University, President of the Association,\r\nand representative of ecclesiastical conservatism and orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nI was officially asked to second the vote of thanks for the address,\r\nand got a copy of it the night before--luckily--for it was a kittle\r\nbusiness...\r\n\r\nIt was very queer to sit there and hear the doctrines you and I were\r\ndamned for advocating thirty-four years ago at Oxford, enunciated as\r\nmatters of course--disputed by no reasonable man!--in the Sheldonian\r\nTheatre by the Chancellor...\r\n\r\nOf course there is not much left of me, and it will take a fortnight's\r\nquiet at Eastbourne (whither we return on Tuesday next) to get right.\r\nBut it was a pleasant last flare-up in the socket!\r\n\r\nWith our love to you both.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, August 18, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Campbell,\r\n\r\nI am setting you a good example. You and I are really too old friends\r\nto go on wasting ink in honorary prefixes.\r\n\r\nI had a very difficult task at Oxford. The old Adam, of course,\r\nprompted the tearing of the address to pieces, which would have been a\r\nvery easy job, especially the latter half of it. But as that procedure\r\nwould not have harmonised well with the function of a seconder of a\r\nvote of thanks, and as, moreover, Lord S. was very just and good in his\r\nexpressions about Darwin, I had to convey criticism in the shape of\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nIt was very curious to me to sit there and hear the Chancellor of the\r\nUniversity accept, as a matter of course, the doctrines for which the\r\nBishop of Oxford coarsely anathematised us thirty-four years earlier. E\r\npur si muove!\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of the priests in the long-run. Scientific method is\r\nthe white ant which will slowly but surely destroy their\r\nfortifications. And the importance of scientific method in modern\r\npractical life--always growing and increasing--is the guarantee for the\r\ngradual emancipation of the ignorant upper and lower classes, the\r\nformer of whom especially are the strength of the priests.\r\n\r\nMy wife had a very bad attack of her old enemy some weeks ago, and she\r\nthought she would not be able to go to Oxford. However, she picked up\r\nin the wonderfully elastic way she has, and I believe was less done-up\r\nthan I when we left on the Friday morning. I was glad the wife was\r\nthere, as the meeting gave me a very kind reception, and it was\r\nprobably the last flare-up in the socket.\r\n\r\nThe Warden of Merton took great care of us, but it was sad to think of\r\nthe vacuity of Balliol.\r\n\r\nPlease remember me very kindly to Father Steffens and the Steeles, and\r\nwill you tell Herr Walther we are only waiting for a balloon to visit\r\nthe hotel again?\r\n\r\nWith our affectionate regards to Mrs. Campbell and yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Here also belong several letters of miscellaneous interest. One is to\r\nMrs. Lewis Campbell at the Maloja.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, August 20, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mrs. Campbell,\r\n\r\nWhat a pity I am not a telepath! I might have answered your inquiry in\r\nthe letter I was writing to your husband yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe flower I found on the island in Sils Lake was a cross between\r\nGentiana lutea and Gentiana punctata--nothing new, but interesting in\r\nmany ways as a natural hybrid.\r\n\r\nAs to baptizing the island, I am not guilty of usurping ecclesiastical\r\nfunctions to that extent. I have a notion that the island has a name\r\nalready, but I cannot recollect it. Walther would know.\r\n\r\nMy wife had a bad attack, and we were obliged to give up some visits we\r\nhad projected. But she got well enough to go to Oxford with me for a\r\ncouple of days, and really stood the racket better than I did.\r\n\r\nAt present she is fairly well, and I hope the enemy may give her a long\r\nrespite. The Colliers come to us at the end of this month, and that\r\nwill do her good.\r\n\r\nWith our affectionate regards to you both and remembrances to our\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nEver yours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The first of the following set refers to a lively piece of nonsense\r\nwhich Huxley wrote just before going to stay with the Romanes' at\r\nOxford on the occasion of the Romanes Lecture. (See above.) After\r\nProfessor Romanes' death, Mrs. Romanes asked leave to print it in the\r\nbiography of her husband. In the other letters, Huxley gives his\r\nconsent, but, with his usual care for the less experienced, tried to\r\nprevent any malicious perversion of the fun which might put her in a\r\nfalse position.]\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Romanes.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, September 20, 1894.\r\n\r\nI do not think I can possibly have any objection to your using my\r\nletter if you think it worth while--but perhaps you had better let me\r\nlook at it, for I remember nothing about it--and my letters to people\r\nwhom I trust are sometimes more plain-spoken than polite about things\r\nand men. You know at first there was some talk of my possibly supplying\r\nGladstone's place in case of his failure, and I would not be sure of my\r\npoliteness in that quarter!\r\n\r\nPray do not suppose that your former letter was other than deeply\r\ninteresting and touching to me. I had more than half a mind to reply to\r\nit, but hesitated with a man's horror of touching a wound he cannot\r\nheal.\r\n\r\nAnd then I got a bad bout of \"liver,\" from which I am just picking up.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, September 22, 1894.\r\n\r\nIt's rather a rollicking epistle, I must say, but as my wife (who sends\r\nher love) says she thinks she is the only person who has a right to\r\ncomplain (and she does not), I do not know why it should not be\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I fancy very few people will catch the allusion about not\r\ncontradicting me. But perhaps it would be better to take the opinion of\r\nsome impartial judge on that point.\r\n\r\nI do not care the least on my own account, but I see my words might be\r\ntwisted into meaning that you had told me something about your previous\r\nguest, and that I referred to what you had said.\r\n\r\nOf course you had done nothing of the kind, but as a wary old fox,\r\nexperienced sufferer from the dodges of the misrepresenter, I feel\r\nbound not to let you get into any trouble if I can help it.\r\n\r\nA regular lady's P.S. this.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Letter returned herewith.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Leslie Stephen.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, October 16, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Stephen,\r\n\r\nI am very glad you like to have my omnium gatherum, and think the\r\nbetter of it for gaining me such a pleasant letter of acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nIt is a great loss to me to be cut off from all my old friends, but\r\nsticking closely to my hermitage, with fresh air and immense quantities\r\nof rest, have become the conditions of existence for me, and one must\r\nput up with them.\r\n\r\nI have not paid all the debt incurred in my Oxford escapade yet--the\r\nlast \"little bill\" being a sharp attack of lumbago, out of which I hope\r\nI have now emerged. But my deafness alone should bar me from decent\r\nsociety. I have not the moral courage to avoid making shots at what\r\npeople say, so as not to bore them; and the results are sometimes\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nI don't see there is any real difference between us. You are charitable\r\nenough to overlook the general immorality of the cosmos on the score of\r\nits having begotten morality in one small part of its domain.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. G-- S--.  [See above.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, October 31, 1894.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. S--,\r\n\r\n\"Liver,\" \"lumbago,\" and other small ills the flesh is heir to, have\r\nbeen making me very lazy lately, especially about letter-writing.\r\n\r\nYou have got into the depths where the comprehensible ends in the\r\nincomprehensible--where the symbols which may be used with confidence\r\nso far begin to get shaky.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to me absolutely necessary that matter should be\r\ncomposed of solid particles. The \"atoms\" may be persistent whirlpools\r\nof a continuous \"substance\"--which substance, if at rest, could not\r\naffect us (all sensory impression being dependent on motion) and\r\nsubsequently would FOR US = 0. The evolution of matter would be the\r\ngetting under weigh of this \"nothing for us\" until it became the\r\n\"something for us,\" the different motions of which give us the mental\r\nstates we call the qualities of things.\r\n\r\nBut it needs a very steady head to walk safely among these abysses of\r\nthought, and the only use of letting the mind range among them is as a\r\ncorrective to the hasty dogmatism of the so-called materialists, who\r\ntalk just as glibly of that of which they know nothing as the most\r\nbigoted of the orthodox.\r\n\r\n[Here also stand two letters to Lord Farrer, one before, the other\r\nafter, his address at the Statistical Society on the Relations between\r\nMorals, Economics and Statistics, which touch on several philosophical\r\nand social questions, always, to his mind, intimately connected, and\r\nwherein wrong modes of thought indubitably lead to wrong modes of\r\naction. Noteworthy is a defence of the fundamental method of Political\r\nEconomy, however much its limitations might be forgotten by some of its\r\nexponents. The reference to the Church agitation to introduce dogmatic\r\nteaching into the elementary schools has also a lasting interest.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, November 6, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Farrer,\r\n\r\nWhenever you get over the optimism of your youthful constitution (I\r\nwish I were endowed with that blessing) you will see that the Gospels\r\nand I are right about the Devil being \"Prince\" (note the\r\ndistinction--not \"king\") of the Cosmos.\r\n\r\nThe a priori road to scientific, political, and all other doctrine is\r\nH.R.H. Satan's invention--it is the intellectual, broad, and easy path\r\nwhich leadeth to Jehannum.\r\n\r\nThe king's road is the strait path of painful observation and\r\nexperiment, and few they be that enter thereon.\r\n\r\nR.G. Latham, queerest of men, had singular flashes of insight now and\r\nthen. Forty years ago he gravely told me that the existence of the\r\nEstablished Church was to his mind one of the best evidences of the\r\nrecency of the evolution of the human type from the simian.\r\n\r\nHow much there is to confirm this view in present public opinion and\r\nthe intellectual character of those who influence it!\r\n\r\nIt explains all your difficulties at once, and I regret that I do not\r\nseem to have mentioned it at any of those mid-day symposia which were\r\nso pleasant when you and I were younger.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Apropos of Athelstan Riley and his friends--I fool rather obliged\r\nto them. I assented to the compromise (1) because I felt that English\r\nopinion would not let us have the education of the masses at any\r\ncheaper price; (2) because, with the Bible in lay hands, I was\r\nsatisfied that the teaching from it would gradually become modified\r\ninto harmony with common sense.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that this is exactly what has happened, and is the\r\nground of the alarm of the orthodox.\r\n\r\nBut I do not repent of the compromise in the least. Twenty years of\r\nreasonably good primary education is \"worth a mass.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover the Diggleites stand to lose anyhow, and they will lose most\r\ncompletely and finally if they win at the elections this month. So I am\r\nrather inclined to hope they may.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Staveley Road, Eastbourne, November 3, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Clodd,\r\n\r\nThey say that the first thing an Englishman does when he is hard up for\r\nmoney is to abstain from buying books. The first thing I do when I am\r\nliver-y, lumbagy, and generally short of energy, is to abstain from\r\nanswering letters. And I am only just emerging from a good many weeks\r\nof that sort of flabbiness and poverty.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your notice of Kidd's book. Some vile punsters called\r\nit an attempt to put a Kid glove on the iron hand of Nature. I thought\r\nit (I mean the book, not the pun) clever from a literary point of view,\r\nand worthless from any other. You will see that I have been giving Lord\r\nSalisbury a Roland for his Oliver in \"Nature\". But, as hinted, if we\r\nonly had been in Section D!\r\n\r\nWith my wife's and my kind regards and remembrances.\r\n\r\nEver yours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nAthenaeum Club, December 19, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Farrer,\r\n\r\nI am indebted to you for giving the recording angel less trouble than\r\nhe might otherwise have had, on account of the worse than usual\r\nunpunctuality of the London and Brighton this morning. For I have\r\nutilised the extra time in reading and thinking over your very\r\ninteresting address.\r\n\r\nThanks for your protest against the mischievous a priori method, which\r\npeople will not understand is as gross an anachronism in social matters\r\nas it would be in Hydrostatics. The so-called \"Sociology\" is\r\nhoneycombed with it, and it is hard to say who are worse, the\r\nindividualists or the collectivists. But in your just wrath don't\r\nforget that there is such a thing as a science of social life, for\r\nwhich, if the term had not been so hopelessly degraded, Politics is the\r\nproper name.\r\n\r\nMen are beings of a certain constitution, who, under certain\r\nconditions, will as surely tend to act in certain ways as stones will\r\ntend to fall if you leave them unsupported. The laws of their nature\r\nare as invariable as the laws of gravitation, only the applications to\r\nparticular cases offer worse problems than the case of the three bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Political Economists have gone the right way to work--the way that\r\nthe physical philosopher follows in all complex affairs--by tracing out\r\nthe effects of one great cause of human action, the desire of wealth,\r\nsupposing it to be unchecked.\r\n\r\nIf they, or other people, have forgotten that there are other potent\r\ncauses of action which may interfere with this, it is no fault of\r\nscientific method but only their own stupidity.\r\n\r\nHydrostatics is not a \"dismal science,\" because water does not always\r\nseek the lowest level--e.g. from a bottle turned upside down, if there\r\nis a cork in the neck!\r\n\r\nThere is much need that somebody should do for what is vaguely called\r\n\"Ethics\" just what the Political Economists have done. Settle the\r\nquestion of what will be done under the unchecked action of certain\r\nmotives, and leave the problem of \"ought\" for subsequent consideration.\r\n\r\nFor, whatever they ought to do, it is quite certain the majority of men\r\nwill act as if the attainment of certain positive and negative\r\npleasures were the end of action.\r\n\r\nWe want a science of \"Eubiotics\" to tell us exactly what will happen if\r\nhuman beings are exclusively actuated by the desire of well-being in\r\nthe ordinary sense. Of course the utilitarians have laid the\r\nfoundations of such a science, with the result that the nicknamer of\r\ngenius called this branch of science \"pig philosophy,\" making just the\r\nsame blunder as when he called political economy \"dismal science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moderate well-being\" may be no more the worthiest end of life than\r\nwealth. But if it is the best to be had in this queer world--it may be\r\nworth trying for.\r\n\r\nBut you will begin to wish the train had been PUNCTUAL!\r\n\r\nDraw comfort from the fact that if error is always with us, it is, at\r\nany rate, remediable. I am more hopeful than when I was young. Perhaps\r\nlife (like matrimony, as some say) should begin with a little aversion!\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Some years before this, a fund for a \"Darwin Medal\" had been\r\nestablished in memory of the great naturalist, the medal to be awarded\r\nbiennially for researches in biology. With singular appropriateness,\r\nthe first award was made to Dr. A.R. Wallace, the joint propounder of\r\nthe theory of Natural Selection, whose paper, entrusted to Darwin's\r\nliterary sponsorship, caused the speedy publication of Darwin's own\r\nlong-continued researches and speculations. The second, with equal\r\nappropriateness, was to Sir J.D. Hooker, both as a leader in science\r\nand a helper and adviser of Darwin.\r\n\r\nHuxley's own view of such scientific honours as medals and diplomas was\r\nthat they should be employed to stimulate for the future rather than to\r\nreward for the past; and delighted as he was at the poetic justice of\r\nthese two awards, this justice once satisfied, he let his opinion be\r\nknown that thenceforward the Darwin Medal ought to be given only to\r\nyounger men. But when this year he found the Darwin Medal awarded to\r\nhimself \"for his researches in biology and his long association with\r\nCharles Darwin,\" he could not but be touched and gratified by this mark\r\nof appreciation from his fellow-workers in science, this association in\r\none more scientific record with old allies and true friends--to \"have\r\nhis niche in the Pantheon\" next to Hooker and near to Darwin.\r\n\r\nIt was a rare instance of the fitness of things that the three men who\r\nhad done most to develop and to defend Darwin's ideas should live to\r\nstand first in the list of the Darwin medalists; and Huxley felt this\r\nto be a natural closing of a chapter in his life, a fitting occasion on\r\nwhich to bid farewell to public life in the world of science. Almost at\r\nthe same moment another chapter in science reached its completion in\r\nthe \"coming of age\" of \"Nature\", a journal which, when scientific\r\ninterests at large had grown stronger, had succeeded in realising his\r\nown earlier efforts to found a scientific organ, and with which he had\r\nalways been closely associated.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, he wrote for the November number an introductory\r\narticle called \"Past and Present,\" comparing the state of scientific\r\nthought of the day with that of twenty-five years before, when the\r\njournal was first started. To celebrate the occasion, a dinner was to\r\nbe held this same month of all who had been associated with \"Nature\",\r\nand this Huxley meant to attend, as well as the more important\r\nanniversary dinner of the Royal Society on St. Andrew's Day.]\r\n\r\nI have promised [he writes on November 6 to Sir M. Foster] to go to the\r\n\"Nature\" dinner if I possibly can. Indeed I should be sorry to be away.\r\nAs to the Royal Society nothing short of being confined to bed will\r\nstop me. And I shall be good for a few words after dinner.\r\n\r\nThereafter I hope not to appear again on any stage.\r\n\r\n[His letter about the medal expresses his feelings as to the award.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, November 2, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Foster,\r\n\r\nDidn't I tell the P.R.S., Secretaries, Treasurer, and all the Fellows\r\nthereof, when I spoke about Hooker years ago, that thenceforth the\r\nDarwin Medal was to be given to the young, and not to useless old\r\nextinct volcanoes? I ought to be very angry with you all for coolly\r\nignoring my wise counsels.\r\n\r\nBut whether it is vanity or something a good deal better, I am not. One\r\ngets chill old age, and it is very pleasant to be warmed up\r\nunexpectedly even against one's injunctions. Moreover, my wife is very\r\npleased, not to say jubilant; and if I were made Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury I should not be able to convince her that my services to\r\nTheology were hardly of the sort to be rewarded in that fashion.\r\n\r\nI need not say what I think about your action in the matter, my\r\nfaithful old friend. With our love to you both.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI suppose you are all right again, as you write from the R.S. Liver\r\npermitting I shall attend meeting and dinner. It is very odd that the\r\nMedal should come along with my pronouncement in \"Nature\", which I hope\r\nyou like. I cut out rather a stinging paragraph at the end.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 11, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear Donnelly,\r\n\r\nWhy on earth did I not answer your letter before? Echo (being Irish)\r\nsays, \"Because of your infernal bad habit of putting off; which is\r\ngrowing upon you, you wretched old man.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I shall be very glad if anything can be done for S--. Howes\r\nhas written to me about him since your letter arrived--and I am\r\npositively going to answer his epistle. It's Sunday morning, and I feel\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen that the R.S. has been giving me the Darwin Medal,\r\nthough I gave as broad a hint as was proper the last time I spoke at\r\nthe Anniversary, that it ought to go to the young men. Nevertheless,\r\nwith ordinary inconsistency of the so-called \"rational animal,\" I am\r\nwell pleased.\r\n\r\nI hope you will be at the dinner, and would ask you to be my guest--but\r\nas I thought my boys and boys-in-law would like to be there, I have\r\nalready exceeded my lawful powers of invitation, and had to get a\r\ndispensation from Michael Foster.\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall be like a horse that \"stands at livery\" for some time\r\nafter--but it is positively my last appearance on any stage.\r\n\r\nWe were very glad to hear from Lady Donnelly that you had had a good\r\nand effectual holiday. With\r\nour love.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nI return Howes' letter in case you want it. I see I need not write to\r\nhim again after all. Three cheers!\r\n\r\nPlease give Lady Donnelly this. A number of estimable members of her\r\nsex have flown at me for writing what I thought was a highly\r\ncomplimentary letter. But SHE will be just, I know.\r\n\r\n\"The best of women are apt to be a little weak in the great practical\r\narts of give-and-take, and putting up with a beating, and a little too\r\nstrong in their belief in the efficacy of government. Men learn about\r\nthese things in the ordinary course of their business; women have no\r\nchance in home life, and the boards and councils will be capital\r\nschools for them. Again, in the public interest it will be well; women\r\nare more naturally economical than men, and have none of our false\r\nshame about looking after pence. Moreover, they don't job for any but\r\ntheir lovers, husbands, and children, so that we know the worst.\"\r\n\r\n[The speech at the Royal Society Anniversary dinner--which he evidently\r\nenjoyed making--was a fine piece of speaking, and quite carried away\r\nthe audience, whether in the gentle depreciation of his services to\r\nscience, or in his profession of faith in the methods of science and\r\nthe final triumph of the doctrine of evolution, whatever theories of\r\nits operation might be adopted or discarded in the course of further\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nI quote from the \"Times\" report of the speech:--]\r\n\r\nBut the most difficult task that remains is that which concerns myself.\r\nIt is 43 years ago this day since the Royal Society did me the honour\r\nto award me a Royal medal, and thereby determined my career. But,\r\nhaving long retired into the position of a veteran, I confess that I\r\nwas extremely astonished--I honestly also say that I was extremely\r\npleased to receive the announcement that you had been good enough to\r\naward to me the Darwin Medal. But you know the Royal Society, like all\r\nthings in this world, is subject to criticism. I confess that with the\r\ningrained instincts of an old official that which arose in my mind\r\nafter the reception of the information that I had been thus\r\ndistinguished was to start an inquiry which I suppose suggests itself\r\nto every old official--How can my Government be justified? In\r\nreflecting upon what had been my own share in what are now very largely\r\nancient transactions, it was perfectly obvious to me that I had no such\r\nclaims as those of Mr. Wallace. It was perfectly clear to me that I had\r\nno such claims as those of my lifelong friend Sir Joseph Hooker, who\r\nfor 25 years placed all his great sources of knowledge, his sagacity,\r\nhis industry, at the disposition of his friend Darwin. And really, I\r\nbegin to despair of what possible answer could be given to the critics\r\nwhom the Royal Society, meeting as it does on November 30, has lately\r\nbeen very apt to hear about on December 1. Naturally there occurred to\r\nmy mind that famous and comfortable line, which I suppose has helped so\r\nmany people under like circumstances, \"They also serve who only stand\r\nand wait.\" I am bound to confess that the standing and waiting, so far\r\nas I am concerned, to which I refer, has been of a somewhat peculiar\r\ncharacter. I can only explain it, if you will permit me to narrate a\r\nstory which came to me in my old nautical days, and which, I believe,\r\nhas just as much foundation as a good deal of other information which I\r\nderived at the same period from the same source. There was a merchant\r\nship in which a member of the Society of Friends had taken passage, and\r\nthat ship was attacked by a pirate, and the captain thereupon put into\r\nthe hands of the member of the Society of Friends a pike, and desired\r\nhim to take part in the subsequent action, to which, as you may\r\nimagine, the reply was that he would do nothing of the kind; but he\r\nsaid that he had no objection to stand and wait at the gangway. He did\r\nstand and wait with the pike in his hands, and when the pirates mounted\r\nand showed themselves coming on board he thrust his pike with the sharp\r\nend forward into the persons who were mounting, and he said, \"Friend,\r\nkeep on board thine own ship.\" It is in that sense that I venture to\r\ninterpret the principle of standing and waiting to which I have\r\nreferred. I was convinced as firmly as I have ever been convinced of\r\nanything in my life, that the \"Origin of Species\" was a ship laden with\r\na cargo of rich value, and which, if she were permitted to pursue her\r\ncourse, would reach a veritable scientific Golconda, and I thought it\r\nmy duty, however naturally averse I might be to fighting, to bid those\r\nwho would disturb her beneficent operations to keep on board their own\r\nship. If it has pleased the Royal Society to recognise such poor\r\nservices as I may have rendered in that capacity, I am very glad,\r\nbecause I am as much convinced now as I was 34 years ago that the\r\ntheory propounded by Mr. Darwin--I mean that which he propounded, not\r\nthat which has been reported to be his by too many ill-instructed, both\r\nfriends and foes--has never yet been shown to be inconsistent with any\r\npositive observations, and if I may use a phrase which I know has been\r\nobjected to, and which I use in a totally different sense from that in\r\nwhich it was first proposed by its first propounder, I do believe that\r\non all grounds of pure science it \"holds the field,\" as the only\r\nhypothesis at present before us which has a sound scientific\r\nfoundation. It is quite possible that you will apply to me the remark\r\nthat has often been applied to persons in such a position as mine, that\r\nwe are apt to exaggerate the importance of that to which our lives have\r\nbeen more or less devoted. But I am sincerely of opinion that the views\r\nwhich were propounded by Mr. Darwin 34 years ago may be understood\r\nhereafter as constituting an epoch in the intellectual history of the\r\nhuman race. They will modify the whole system of our thought and\r\nopinion, our most intimate convictions. But I do not know, I do not\r\nthink anybody knows, whether the particular views which he held will be\r\nhereafter fortified by the experience of the ages which come after us;\r\nbut of this thing I am perfectly certain, that the present course of\r\nthings has resulted from the feeling of the smaller men who have\r\nfollowed him that they are incompetent to bend the bow of Ulysses, and\r\nin consequence many of them are seeking their salvation in mere\r\nspeculation. Those who wish to attain to some clear and definite\r\nsolution of the great problems which Mr. Darwin was the first person to\r\nset before us in later times must base themselves upon the facts which\r\nare stated in his great work, and, still more, must pursue their\r\ninquiries by the methods of which he was so brilliant an exemplar\r\nthroughout the whole of his life. You must have his sagacity, his\r\nuntiring search after the knowledge of fact, his readiness always to\r\ngive up a preconceived opinion to that which was demonstrably true,\r\nbefore you can hope to carry his doctrines to their ultimate issue; and\r\nwhether the particular form in which he has put them before us may be\r\nsuch as is finally destined to survive or not is more, I venture to\r\nthink, than anybody is capable at this present moment of saying. But\r\nthis one thing is perfectly certain--that it is only by pursuing his\r\nmethods, by that wonderful single-mindedness, devotion to truth,\r\nreadiness to sacrifice all things for the advance of definite\r\nknowledge, that we can hope to come any nearer than we are at present\r\nto the truths which he struggled to attain.\r\n\r\nTo Sir J.D. Hooker.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, December 4, 1894.\r\n\r\nMy dear old Man,\r\n\r\nSee the respect I have for your six years' seniority! I wished you had\r\nbeen at the dinner, but was glad you were not. Especially as next\r\nmorning there was a beastly fog, out of which I bolted home as fast as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI shall have to give up these escapades. They knock me up for a week\r\nafterwards. And really it is a pity, just as I have got over my horror\r\nof public speaking, and find it very amusing. But I suppose I should\r\ngravitate into a bore as old fellows do, and so it is as well I am kept\r\nout of temptation.\r\n\r\nI will try to remember what I said at the \"Nature\" dinner. I scolded\r\nthe young fellows pretty sharply for their slovenly writing. [A brief\r\nreport of this speech is to be found in the \"British Medical Journal\"\r\nfor December 8, 1894, page 1262.]\r\n\r\nThere will be a tenth volume of Essays some day, and an Index rerum. Do\r\nyou remember how you scolded me for being too speculative in my maiden\r\nlecture on Animal Individuality forty odd years ago? \"On revient\r\ntoujours,\" or, to put it another way, \"The dog returns to his etc. etc.\"\r\n\r\nSo I am deep in philosophy, grovelling through Diogenes\r\nLaertius--Plutarch's \"Placita\" and sich--and often wondering whether\r\nthe schoolmasters have any better ground for maintaining that Greek is\r\na finer language than English than the fact that they can't write the\r\nlatter dialect.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can see, my faculties are as good (including memory for\r\nanything that is not useful) as they were fifty years ago, but I can't\r\nwork long hours, or live out of fresh air. Three days of London bowls\r\nme over.\r\n\r\nI expect you are in much the same case. But you seem to be able to\r\nstoop over specimens in a way impossible to me. It is that incapacity\r\nhas made me give up dissection and microscopic work. I do a lot on my\r\nback, and I can tell you that the latter posture is an immense economy\r\nof strength. Indeed, when my heart was troublesome, I used to spend my\r\ntime either in active outdoor exercise or horizontally.\r\n\r\nThe Stracheys were here the other day, and it was a great pleasure to\r\nus to see them. I think he has had a very close shave with that\r\naccident. There is nobody whom I should more delight to honour--a right\r\ngood man all round--but I am not competent to judge of his work. You\r\nare, and I do not see why you should not suggest it. I would give him a\r\nmedal for being R. Strachey, but probably the Council would make\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nBy the way, do you see the \"Times\" has practically climbed down about\r\nthe Royal Society--came down backwards like a bear, growling all the\r\ntime? I don't think we shall have any more first of December criticisms.\r\n\r\nLord help you through all this screed. With our love to you both.\r\n\r\nEver yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nAbram, Abraham became\r\nBy will divine;\r\nLet pickled Brian's name\r\nBe changed to Brine!\r\n\"Poetae Minores\".\r\n\r\nPoor Brian.--Brutal jest!\r\n\r\n[(Sir Joseph's son, Brian, had fallen into a pan of brine.)\r\n\r\nThe following was written to a friend who had alluded to his painful\r\nrecollection of a former occasion when he was Huxley's guest at the\r\nanniversary dinner of the Royal Society, and was hastily summoned from\r\nit to find his wife dying.]\r\n\r\nI fully understand your feeling about the R.S. Dinner. I have not\r\nforgotten the occasion when you were my guest: still less my brief\r\nsight of you when I called the next day.\r\n\r\nThese things are the \"lachrymae rerum\"--the abysmal griefs hidden under\r\nthe current of daily life, and seemingly forgotten, till now and then\r\nthey come up to the surface--a flash of agony--like the fish that jumps\r\nin a calm pool.\r\n\r\nOne has one's groan and goes to work again.\r\n\r\nIf I knew of anything else for it, I would tell you; but all my\r\nexperience ends in the questionable thanksgiving, \"It's lucky it's no\r\nworse.\"\r\n\r\nWith which bit of practical philosophy, and our love, believe me, ever\r\nyours affectionately,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Before speaking of his last piece of work, in the vain endeavour to\r\ncomplete which he exposed himself to his old enemy, influenza, I shall\r\ngive several letters of miscellaneous interest.\r\n\r\nThe first is in reply to Lord Farrer's inquiry as to where he could\r\nobtain a fuller account of the subject tersely discussed in the chapter\r\nhe had contributed to the \"Life of Owen\". (\"Which,\" wrote Lord Farrer,\r\n\"is just what I wanted as an outline of the Biological and\r\nMorphological discussion of the last 100 years. But it is 'Pemmican' to\r\nan aged and enfeebled digestion. Is there such a thing as a diluted\r\nsolution of it in the shape of any readable book?\")]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, January 26, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Farrer,\r\n\r\nMiserable me! Having addressed myself to clear off a heap of letters\r\nthat have been accumulating, I find I have not answered an inquiry of\r\nyours of nearly a month's standing. I am sorry to say that I cannot\r\ntell you of any book (readable or otherwise) that will convert my\r\n\"pemmican\" into decent broth for you.\r\n\r\nThere are histories of zoology and of philosophical anatomy, but they\r\nall of them seem to me to miss the point (which you have picked out of\r\nthe pemmican). Indeed, that is just why I took such a lot of pains over\r\nthese 50 or 60 pages. And I am immensely tickled by the fact that among\r\nall the critical notices I have seen, not a soul sees what I have been\r\ndriving at as you have done. I really wish you would write a notice of\r\nit, just to show these Gigadibses (vide Right Reverend Blougram) what\r\nblind buzzards they are! [See Browning's \"Bishop Blougram's\r\nApology\":--\"Gigadibs the literary man\" with his\r\nAbstract intellectual plan of life\r\nQuite irrespective of life's plainest laws.]\r\n\r\nEnter a maid. \"Please sir, Mrs. Huxley says she would be glad if you\r\nwould go out in the sun.\" \"All right, Allen.\" Anecdote for your next\r\nessay on Government!\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I have been knocked up ever since Tuesday, when our\r\nUniversity Deputation came off; and my good wife (who is laid up\r\nherself) suspects me (not without reason) of failing to take advantage\r\nof a gleam of sunshine.\r\n\r\nBy the way, can you help us over the University business? Lord Rosebery\r\nis favourable, and there is absolutely nobody on the other side except\r\nsundry Philistines, who, having got their degrees, are desirous of\r\ninflating their market value.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The next is in answer to an appeal for a subscription, from the Church\r\nArmy.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 26, 1895.\r\n\r\nI regret that I am unable to contribute to the funds of the Church Army.\r\n\r\nI hold it to be my duty to do what I can for the cases of distress of\r\nwhich I have direct knowledge; and I am glad to be able now and then to\r\ngive timely aid to the industrious and worthy people with whom, as a\r\nhouseholder, I am brought into personal relation; and who are so often\r\nengaged in a noiseless and unpitied but earnest struggle to do well.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment, a domestic servant, who is perhaps giving half her\r\nwages to support her old parents, is more worthy of help than\r\nhalf-a-dozen Magdalens.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, you will understand that such funds as are\r\nat my disposal are already fully engaged.\r\n\r\n[The following is to a gentleman--an American, I think--who sent him a\r\nlong manuscript, an extraordinary farrago of nonsense, to read and\r\ncriticise, and help to publish. But as he seemed to have acted in sheer\r\nsimplicity, he got an answer:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, January 31, 1895.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI should have been glad if you had taken the ordinary, and, I think,\r\nconvenient course of writing for my permission before you sent the\r\nessay which has reached me, and which I return by this post. I should\r\nthen have had the opportunity of telling you that I do not undertake to\r\nread, or take any charge of such matters, and we should both have been\r\nspared some trouble.\r\n\r\nI the more regret this, since being unwilling to return your work\r\nwithout examination, I have looked at it, and feel bound to give you\r\nthe following piece of advice, which I fear may be distasteful, as good\r\ncounsel generally is.\r\n\r\nLock up your essay. For two years--if possible, three--read no popular\r\nexpositions of science, but devote yourself to a course of sound\r\nPRACTICAL instruction in elementary physics, chemistry, and biology.\r\n\r\nThen re-read your essay; do with it as you think best; and, if\r\npossible, regard a little more kindly than you are likely to do at\r\npresent, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The following passage from a letter to Sir J.D. Hooker refers to a\r\nstriking discovery made by Dubois:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 14, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe Dutchmen seem to have turned up something like the \"missing link\"\r\nin Java, according to a paper I have just received from Marsh. I expect\r\nhe was a Socratic party, with his hair rather low down on his forehead\r\nand warty cheeks.\r\n\r\nPithecanthropus erectus Dubois (fossil)\r\n\r\nrather Aino-ish about the body, small in the calf, and cheese-cutting\r\nin the shins. Le voici!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.14.\r\n\r\n1895.\r\n\r\nTwo months of almost continuous frost, during which the thermometer\r\nfell below zero, marked the winter of 1894-95. Tough, if not strong, as\r\nHuxley's constitution was, this exceptional cold, so lowering to the\r\nvitality of age, accentuated the severity of the illness which followed\r\nin the train of influenza, and at last undermined even his powers of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nBut until the influenza seized him, he was more than usually vigorous\r\nand brilliant. He was fatigued, but not more so than he expected, by\r\nattending a deputation to the Prime Minister in the depth of January,\r\nand delivering a speech on the London University question; and in\r\nFebruary he was induced to write a reply to the attack upon agnosticism\r\ncontained in Mr. Arthur Balfour's \"Foundations of Belief\". Into this he\r\nthrew himself with great energy, all the more because the notices in\r\nthe daily press were likely to give the reading public a wrong\r\nimpression as to its polemic against his own position. Mr. Wilfrid Ward\r\ngives an account of a conversation with him on this subject:--\r\n\r\nSome one had sent me Mr. A.J. Balfour's book on the \"Foundations of\r\nBelief\" early in February 1895. We were very full of it, and it was the\r\ntheme of discussion on the 17th of February, when two friends were\r\nlunching with us. Not long after luncheon, Huxley came in, and seemed\r\nin extraordinary spirits, he began talking of Erasmus and Luther,\r\nexpressing a great preference for Erasmus, who would, he said, have\r\nimpregnated the Church with culture, and brought it abreast of the\r\nthought of the times, while Luther concentrated attention on individual\r\nmystical doctrines. \"It was very trying for Erasmus to be identified\r\nwith Luther, from whom he differed absolutely. A man ought to be ready\r\nto endure persecution for what he does hold; but it is hard to be\r\npersecuted for what you don't hold.\" I said that I thought his estimate\r\nof Erasmus's attitude towards the Papacy coincided with Professor R.C.\r\nJebb's. He asked if I could lend him Jebb's Rede Lecture on the\r\nsubject. I said that I had not got it at hand, but I added, \"I can lend\r\nyou another book, which I think you ought to read--Balfour's\r\n'Foundations of Belief'.\"\r\n\r\nHe at once became extremely animated, and spoke of it as those who have\r\nread his criticisms, published in the following month, would expect.]\r\n\"You need not lend me that. I have exercised my mind with it a good\r\ndeal already. Mr. Balfour ought to have acquainted himself with the\r\nopinions of those he attacks. One has no objection to being abused for\r\nwhat one DOES hold, as I said of Erasmus; at least, one is prepared to\r\nput up with it. An attack on us by some one who understood our position\r\nwould do all of us good--myself included. But Mr. Balfour has acted\r\nlike the French in 1870: he has gone to war without any ordnance maps,\r\nand without having surveyed the scene of the campaign. No human being\r\nholds the opinions he speaks of as 'Naturalism.' He is a good debater.\r\nHe knows the value of a word. The word 'Naturalism' has a bad sound and\r\nunpleasant associations. It would tell against us in the House of\r\nCommons, and so it will with his readers. 'Naturalism' contrasts with\r\n'supernaturalism.' He has not only attacked us for what we don't hold,\r\nbut he has been good enough to draw out a catechism for 'us wicked\r\npeople,' to teach us what we MUST hold.\"\r\n\r\n[It was rather difficult to get him to particulars, but we did so by\r\ndegrees. He said], \"Balfour uses the word phenomena as applying simply\r\nto the outer world and not to the inner world. The only people his\r\nattack would hold good of would be the Comtists, who deny that\r\npsychology is a science. They may be left out of account. They advocate\r\nthe crudest eighteenth-century materialism. All the empiricists, from\r\nLocke onwards, make the observation of the phenomena of the mind itself\r\nquite separate from the study of mere sensation. No man in his senses\r\nsupposes that the sense of beauty, or the religious feelings [this with\r\na courteous bow to a priest who was present], or the sense of moral\r\nobligation, are to be accounted for in terms of sensation, or come to\r\nus through sensation.\" [I said that, as I understood it, I did not\r\nthink Mr. Balfour supposed they would acknowledge the position he\r\nascribed to them, and that one of his complaints was that they did not\r\nwork out their premises to their logical conclusions. I added that so\r\nfar as one of Mr. Balfour's chief points was concerned--the existence\r\nof the external world--Mill was almost the only man on their side in\r\nthis century who had faced the problem frankly, and he had been driven\r\nto say that all men can know is that there are \"permanent possibilities\r\nof sensation.\" He did not seem inclined to pursue the question of an\r\nexternal world, but said that though Mill's \"Logic\" was very good,\r\nempiricists were not bound by all his theories.\r\n\r\nHe characterised the book as a very good and even brilliant piece of\r\nwork from a literary point of view; but as a helpful contribution to\r\nthe great controversy, the most disappointing he had ever read. I said,\r\n\"There has been no adverse criticism of it yet.\" He answered with\r\nemphasis], \"No! BUT THERE SOON WILL BE.\" [\"From you?\" I asked.] \"I let\r\nout no secrets,\" [was the reply.\r\n\r\nHe then talked with great admiration and affection of Mr. Balfour's\r\nbrother, Francis. His early death, and W.K. Clifford's (Huxley said),\r\nhad been the greatest loss to science--not only in England, but in the\r\nworld--in our time.] \"Half a dozen of us old fogies could have been\r\nbetter spared.\" [He remembered Frank Balfour as a boy at [Harrow] and\r\nsaw his unusual talent there.] \"Then my friend, Michael Foster, took\r\nhim up at Cambridge, and found out that he had real genius for biology.\r\nI used to say there was science in the blood, but this new book of his\r\nbrother's,\" [he added, smiling], \"shows I was wrong.\"\r\n\r\nApropos to his remark about the Comtists, one of the company pointed\r\nout that in later life Comte recognised a science of \"the individual,\"\r\nequivalent to what Huxley meant by psychology.] \"That,\" [he replied],\r\n\"was due to the influence of Clotilde de Vaux. You see,\" [he added,\r\nwith a kind of Sir Charles Grandison bow to my wife], \"what power your\r\nsex may have.\" [As Huxley was going out of the house, I said to him\r\nthat Father A.B. (the priest who had been present) had not expected to\r\nfind himself in his company.] \"No! I trust he had plenty of holy water\r\nwith him,\" [was the reply.\r\n\r\n...After he had gone, we were all agreed as to the extraordinary vigour\r\nand brilliancy he had shown. Some one said, \"He is like a man who is\r\nwhat the Scotch call 'fey.'\" We laughed at the idea, but we naturally\r\nrecalled the remark later on.\r\n\r\nThe story of how the article was written is told in the following\r\nletters. It was suggested by Mr. Knowles, and undertaken after perusal\r\nof the review of the book in the \"Times\". Huxley intended to have the\r\narticle ready for the March number of the \"Nineteenth Century\", but it\r\ngrew longer than he had meant it to be, and partly for this reason,\r\npartly for fear lest the influenza, then raging at Eastbourne, might\r\nprevent him from revising the whole thing at once, he divided it into\r\ntwo instalments. He writes to one daughter on March 1:--]\r\n\r\nI suppose my time will come; so I am \"making hay while the sun shines\"\r\n(in point of fact it is raining and blowing a gale outside) and\r\nfinishing my counterblast to Balfour before it does come.\r\n\r\nLove to all you poor past snivellers from an expectant sniveller.\r\n\r\n[And to another:--]\r\n\r\nI think the cavalry charge in this month's \"Nineteenth\" will amuse you.\r\nThe heavy artillery and the bayonets will be brought into play next\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nDean Stanley told me he thought being made a bishop destroyed a man's\r\nmoral courage. I am inclined to think that the practice of the methods\r\nof political leaders destroys their intellect for all serious purposes.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the first part safely sent off than the contingency he\r\nhad feared came to pass; only, instead of the influenza meaning\r\nincapacity for a fortnight, an unlucky chill brought on bronchitis and\r\nsevere lung trouble. (As he wrote on February 28 to Sir M. Foster]: \"If\r\nI could compound for a few hours' neuralgia, I would not mind; but\r\nthose long weeks of debility make me very shy of the influenza demon.\r\nHere we are practically isolated...I once asked Gordon why he didn't\r\nhave the African fever. 'Well,' he said, you see, fellows think they\r\nshall have it, and they do. I didn't think so, and didn't get it.'\r\nExercise your thinking faculty to that extent.\") The second part of the\r\narticle was never fully revised for press.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 8, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nYour telegram came before I had looked at to-day's \"Times\" and the\r\narticle on Balfour's book, so I answered with hesitation.\r\n\r\nNow I am inclined to think that the job may be well worth doing, in\r\nthat it will give me the opportunity of emphasising the distinction\r\nbetween the view I hold and Spencer's, and perhaps of proving that\r\nBalfour is an agnostic after my own heart. So please send the book.\r\n\r\nOnly if this infernal weather, which shrivels me up soul and body,\r\nlasts, I do not know how long I may be over the business. However, you\r\ntell me to take my own time.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 18, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI send you by this post an instalment (the larger moiety) of my\r\narticle, which I should be glad to have set up at once IN SLIP, and\r\nsent to me as speedily as may be. The rest shall follow in the course\r\nof the next two or three days.\r\n\r\nI am rather pleased with the thing myself, so it is probably not so\r\nvery good! But you will judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 19, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nWe send our best congratulations to Mrs. Knowles and yourself on the\r\nbirth of a grand-daughter. I forget whether you have had any previous\r\nexperience of the \"Art d'etre Grandpere\" or not--but I can assure you,\r\nfrom 14 such experiences, that it is easy and pleasant of acquirement,\r\nand that the objects of it are veritable \"articles de luxe,\" involving\r\nmuch amusement and no sort of responsibility on the part of the\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\nYou shall have the rest of my screed by to-morrow's post.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 20, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nSeven mortal hours have I been hard at work this day to try to keep my\r\npromise to you, and as I find that impossible, I have struck work and\r\nwill see Balfour and his \"Foundations\", and even that ark of literature\r\nthe \"Nineteenth\", at Ballywack, before I do any more.\r\n\r\nBut the whole affair shall be sent by a morning's post to-morrow. I\r\nhave the proofs. I have found the thing getting too long for one paper,\r\nand requiring far more care than I could put into the next two days--so\r\nI propose to divide it, if you see no objection.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another reason for this course. Influenza is raging here.\r\nI hear of hundreds of cases, and if it comes my way, as it did before,\r\nI go to bed and stop there--\"the world forgetting and by the world\r\nforgot\"--until I am killed or cured. So you would not get your article.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, it is not a bad gambit. We will play the rest of the game\r\nafterwards, D.V. and K.V.\r\n\r\nHope mother and baby are doing well.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, February 23, 1895, 12.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI have just played and won as hard a match against time as I ever knew\r\nin the days of my youth. The proofs, happily, arrived by the first\r\npost, so I got to work at them before 9, polished them off by 12, and\r\nput them into the post (myself) by 12.5. So you ought to have them by 6\r\nP.M. And, to make your mind easy, I have just telegraphed to you to say\r\nso. But, Lord's sake! let some careful eye run over the part of which I\r\nhave had no revise--for I am \"capable de tout\" in the way of\r\noverlooking errors.\r\n\r\nI am very glad you like the thing. The second instalment shall be no\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nI grieve to say that my estimation of Balfour, as a thinker, sinks\r\nlower and lower, the further I go.\r\n\r\nGod help the people who think his book an important contribution to\r\nthought! The Gigadibsians who say so are past divine assistance!\r\n\r\nWe are very glad to hear the grandchild and mother are getting on so\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nEver yours very truly,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 8, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nThe proofs have just arrived, but I am sorry to say that (I believe for\r\nthe first time in our transactions) I shall have to disappoint you.\r\n\r\nJust after I had sent off the manuscript influenza came down upon me\r\nwith a swoop. I went to bed and am there still, with no chance of\r\nquitting it in a hurry. My wife is in the same case; item one of the\r\nmaids. The house is a hospital, and by great good fortune we have a\r\ncapital nurse.\r\n\r\nDoctor says its a mild type, in which case I wonder what severe types\r\nmay be like.  (\"But in the matter of aches and pains, restless\r\nparoxysms of coughing and general incapacity, I can give it a high\r\ncharacter for efficiency.\" [To M. Foster, March 7.]) I find coughing\r\ncontinuously for fourteen hours or so a queer kind of mildness.\r\n\r\nCould you put in an excuse on account of influenza?\r\n\r\nCan't write any more.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, March 19, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Knowles,\r\n\r\nI am making use of the pen of my dear daughter and good nurse, in the\r\nfirst place to thank you for your cheque, in the second place to say\r\nthat you must not look for the article this month. I haven't been out\r\nof bed since the 1st, but they are fighting a battle with bronchitis\r\nover my body.\r\n\r\nEver yours very faithfully,\r\n\r\nFor T.H.H., Sophy Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The next four months were a period of painful struggle against\r\ndisease, borne with a patience and gentleness which was rare even in\r\nthe long experience of the trained nurses who tended him. To natural\r\ntoughness of constitution he added a power of will unbroken by the long\r\nstrain; and for the sake of others to whom his life meant so much, he\r\nwished to recover and willed to do everything towards recovery. And so\r\nhe managed to throw off the influenza and the severe bronchitis which\r\nattended it. What was marvellous at his age, and indeed would scarcely\r\nhave been expected in a young man, most serious mischief induced by the\r\nbronchitis disappeared. By May he was strong enough to walk from the\r\nterrace to the lawn and his beloved saxifrages, and to remount the\r\nsteps to the house without help.\r\n\r\nBut though the original attack was successfully thrown off, the lung\r\ntrouble had affected the heart; and in his weakened state, renal\r\nmischief ensued. Yet he held out splendidly, never giving in, save for\r\none hour of utter prostration, all through this weary length of\r\nsickness. His first recovery strengthened him in expecting to get well\r\nfrom the second attack. And on June 10 he writes brightly enough to Sir\r\nJ.D. Hooker:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, June 10, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Old Friend,\r\n\r\nIt was cheering to get your letter and to hear that you had got through\r\nwinter and diphtheria without scathe.\r\n\r\nI can't say very much for myself yet, but I am carried down to a tent\r\nin the garden every day, and live in the fresh air all I can. The thing\r\nthat keeps me back is an irritability of the stomach tending to the\r\nrejection of all solid food. However, I think I am slowly getting the\r\nbetter of it--thanks to my constitutional toughness and careful nursing\r\nand dieting.\r\n\r\nWhat has Spencer been trampling on the \"Pour le merite\" for, when he\r\naccepted the Lyncei? I was just writing to congratulate him when, by\r\ngood luck, I saw he had refused!\r\n\r\nThe beastly nausea which comes on when I try to do anything warns me to\r\nstop.\r\n\r\nWith our love to you both,\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[The last time I saw him was on a visit to Eastbourne from June 22-24.\r\nI was astonished to find how well he looked in spite of all; thin,\r\nindeed, but browned with the endless sunshine of the 1895 summer as he\r\nsat every day in the verandah. His voice was still fairly strong; he\r\nwas delighted to see us about him, and was cheerful, even merry at\r\ntimes. As the nurse said, she could not expect him to recover, but he\r\ndid not look like a dying man. When I asked him how he was, he said, \"A\r\nmere carcass, which has to be tended by other people.\" But to the last\r\nhe looked forward to recovery. One day he told the nurse that the\r\ndoctors must be wrong about the renal mischief, for if they were right,\r\nhe ought already to be in a state of coma. This was precisely what they\r\nfound most astonishing in his case; it seemed as if the mind, the\r\nstrong nervous organisation, were triumphing over the shattered body.\r\nHerein lay one of the chief hopes of ultimate recovery.\r\n\r\nAs late as June 26 he wrote, with shaky handwriting but indomitable\r\nspirit, to relieve his old friend from the anxiety he must feel from\r\nthe newspaper bulletins.]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, June 26, 1895.\r\n\r\nMy dear Hooker,\r\n\r\nThe pessimistic reports of my condition which have got into the papers\r\nmay be giving you unnecessary alarm for the condition of your old\r\ncomrade. So I send a line to tell you the exact state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThere is kidney mischief going on--and it is accompanied by very\r\ndistressing attacks of nausea and vomiting, which sometimes last for\r\nhours and make life a burden.\r\n\r\nHowever, strength keeps up very well considering, and of course all\r\ndepends upon how the renal business goes. At present I don't feel at\r\nall like \"sending in my checks,\" and without being over sanguine I\r\nrather incline to think that my native toughness will get the best of\r\nit--albuminuria or otherwise.\r\n\r\nEver your faithful friend,\r\n\r\nT.H.H.\r\n\r\nMisfortunes never come single. My son-in-law, Eckersley, died of yellow\r\nfever the other day at San Salvador--just as he was going to take up an\r\nappointment at Lima worth 1200 pounds a year. Rachel and her three\r\nchildren have but the slenderest provision.\r\n\r\n[The next two days there was a slight improvement but on the third\r\nmorning the heart began to fail. The great pain subdued by\r\nanaesthetics, he lingered on about seven hours, and at half-past three\r\non June 29 passed away very quietly.\r\n\r\nHe was buried at Finchley, on July 4, beside his brother George and his\r\nlittle son Noel, under the shadow of the oak, which had grown up into a\r\nstately young tree from the little sapling it had been when the grave\r\nof his first-born was dug beneath it, five and thirty years before.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was of a private character. An old friend, the Reverend\r\nLlewelyn Davies, came from Kirkby Lonsdale to read the service; the\r\nmany friends who gathered at the grave-side were there as friends\r\nmourning the death of a friend, and all touched with the same sense of\r\npersonal loss.\r\n\r\nBy his special direction, three lines from a poem written by his wife,\r\nwere inscribed upon his tombstone--lines inspired by his own robust\r\nconviction that, all question of the future apart, this life as it can\r\nbe lived, pain, sorrow, and evil notwithstanding, is worth--and well\r\nworth-living:--\r\n\r\nBe not afraid, ye waiting hearts that weep;\r\nFor still He giveth His beloved sleep,\r\nAnd if an endless sleep He wills, so best.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.15.\r\n\r\nHe had intellect to comprehend his highest duty distinctly, and force\r\nof character to do it; which of us dare ask for a higher summary of his\r\nlife than that?\r\n\r\n[Such was Huxley's epitaph upon Henslow; it was the standard which he\r\nendeavoured to reach in his own life. It is the expression of that\r\npassion for veracity which was perhaps his strongest characteristic; an\r\nuncompromising passion for truth in thought, which would admit no\r\nparticle of self-deception, no assertion beyond what could be verified;\r\nfor truth in act, perfect straightforwardness and sincerity, with\r\ncomplete disregard of personal consequences for uttering unpalatable\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nTruthfulness, in his eyes, was the cardinal virtue, without which no\r\nstable society can exist. Conviction, sincerity, he always respected,\r\nwhether on his own side or against him. Clever men, he would say, are\r\nas common as blackberries; the rare thing is to find a good one. The\r\nlie from interested motives was only more hateful to him than the lie\r\nfrom self-delusion or foggy thinking. With this he classed the \"sin of\r\nfaith,\" as he called it; that form of credence which does not fulfil\r\nthe duty of making a right use of reason; which prostitutes reason by\r\ngiving assent to propositions which are neither self-evident nor\r\nadequately proved.\r\n\r\nThis principle has always been far from finding universal acceptance.\r\nOne of his theological opponents went so far as to affirm that a\r\ndoctrine may be not only held, but dogmatically insisted on, by a\r\nteacher who is, all the time, fully aware that science may ultimately\r\nprove it to be quite untenable.\r\n\r\nHis own course went to the opposite extreme. In teaching, where it was\r\npossible to let the facts speak for themselves, he did not further urge\r\ntheir bearing upon wider problems. He preferred to warn beginners\r\nagainst drawing superficial inferences in favour of his own general\r\ntheories, from facts the real meaning of which was not immediately\r\napparent. Father Hahn (S.J.), who studied under him in 1876, writes:--\r\n\r\nOne day when I was talking to him, our conversation turned upon\r\nevolution. \"There is one thing about you I cannot understand,\" I said,\r\n\"and I should like a word in explanation. For several months now I have\r\nbeen attending your course, and I have never heard you mention\r\nevolution, while in your public lectures everywhere you openly proclaim\r\nyourself an evolutionist.\" (\"Revue des Questions Scientifiques\"\r\n(Brussels), for October 1895.)\r\n\r\nNow it would be impossible to imagine a better opportunity for\r\ninsisting on evolution than his lectures on comparative anatomy, when\r\nanimals are set side by side in respect of the gradual development of\r\nfunctions. But Huxley was so reserved on this subject in his lectures\r\nthat, speaking one day of a species forming a transition between two\r\nothers, he immediately added:--]\r\n\r\n\"When I speak of transition I do not in the least mean to say that one\r\nspecies turned into a second to develop thereafter into a third. What I\r\nmean is, that the characters of the second are intermediate between\r\nthose of the two others. It is as if I were to say that such a\r\nCathedral, Canterbury, for example, is a transition between York\r\nMinster and Westminster Abbey. No one would imagine, on hearing the\r\nword transition, that a transmutation of these buildings actually took\r\nplace from one into other.\" [(Doubtless in connection with the familiar\r\nwarning that intermediate types are not necessarily links in the direct\r\nline of descent.)\r\n\r\nBut to return to his reply:--]\r\n\r\n\"Here in my teaching lectures [he said to me] I have time to put the\r\nfacts fully before a trained audience. In my public lectures I am\r\nobliged to pass rapidly over the facts, and I put forward my personal\r\nconvictions. And it is for this that people come to hear me.\"\r\n\r\n[As to the question whether children should be brought up in entire\r\ndisregard to the beliefs rejected by himself, but still current among\r\nthe mass of his fellow-countrymen, he was of opinion that they ought to\r\nknow] \"the mythology of their time and country,\" [otherwise one would\r\nat the best tend to make young prigs of them; but as they grew up their\r\nquestions should be answered frankly. (The wording of a paragraph in\r\nProfessor Mivart's \"Reminiscences\" (\"Nineteenth Century\", December\r\n1897, P. 993), tends, I think, to leave a wrong impression on this\r\npoint.)\r\n\r\nThe natural tendency to veracity, strengthened by the observation of\r\nthe opposite quality in one with whom he was early brought into\r\ncontact, received its decisive impulse, as has been told before, from\r\nCarlyle, whose writings confirmed and established his youthful reader\r\nin a hatred of shams and make-believes equal to his own.\r\n\r\nIn his mind no compromise was possible between truth and untruth. (As\r\nhe once said, when urged to write a more eulogistic notice of a dead\r\nfriend than he thought deserved], \"The only serious temptations to\r\nperjury I have ever known have arisen out of the desire to be of some\r\ncomfort to people I cared for in trouble. If there are such things as\r\nPlato's 'Royal Lies' they are surely those which one is tempted to tell\r\non such occasions. Mrs. -- is such a good devoted little woman, and I\r\nam so doubtful about having a soul, that it seems absurd to hesitate to\r\nperil it for her satisfaction.\") [Against authorities and influences he\r\npublished \"Man's Place in Nature,\" though warned by his friends that to\r\ndo so meant ruin to his prospects. When he had once led the way and\r\nchallenged the upholders of conventional orthodoxy, others backed him\r\nup with a whole armoury of facts. But his fight was as far as possible\r\nfor the truth itself, for fact, not merely for controversial victory or\r\npersonal triumph. Yet, as has been said by a representative of a very\r\ndifferent school of thought, who can wonder that he should have hit out\r\nstraight from the shoulder, in reply to violent or insidious attacks,\r\nthe stupidity of which sometimes merited scorn as well as anger?\r\n\r\nIn his theological controversies he was no less careful to avoid any\r\napproach to mere abuse or ribaldry such as some opponents of Christian\r\ndogma indulged in. For this reason he refused to interpose in the\r\nwell-known Foote case. Discussion, he said, could be carried on\r\neffectually without deliberate wounding of others' feelings.\r\n\r\nAs he wrote in reply to an appeal for help in this case (March 12,\r\n1883):--]\r\n\r\nI have not read the writings for which Mr. Foote was prosecuted. But,\r\nunless their nature has been grossly misrepresented, I cannot say that\r\nI feel disposed to intervene on his behalf.\r\n\r\nI am ready to go great lengths in defence of freedom of discussion, but\r\nI decline to admit that rightful freedom is attacked, when a man is\r\nprevented from coarsely and brutally insulting his neighbours' honest\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nI would rather make an effort to get legal penalties inflicted with\r\nequal rigour on some of the anti-scientific blasphemers--who are quite\r\nas coarse and unmannerly in their attacks on opinions worthy of all\r\nrespect as Mr. Foote can possibly have been.\r\n\r\n[The grand result of his determination not to compromise where truth\r\nwas concerned, was the securing freedom of thought and speech. One man\r\nafter another, looking back on his work, declares that if we can say\r\nwhat we think now, it is because he fought the battle of freedom. Not\r\nindeed the battle of toleration, if toleration means toleration of\r\nerror for its own sake. Error, he thought, ought to be extirpated by\r\nall legitimate means, and not assisted because it is conscientiously\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nAs Lord Hobhouse wrote, soon after his death:--\r\n\r\nI see now many laudatory notices of him in papers. But I have not seen,\r\nand I think the younger men do not know, that which (apart from\r\nscience) I should put forward as his strongest claim to reverence and\r\ngratitude; and that is the steadfast courage and consummate ability\r\nwith which he fought the battle of intellectual freedom, and insisted\r\nthat people should be allowed to speak their honest convictions without\r\nbeing oppressed or slandered by the orthodox. He was one of those,\r\nperhaps the very foremost, who won that priceless freedom for us; and,\r\nas is too common, people enter into the labours of the brave, and do\r\nnot even know what their elders endured, or what has been done for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWith this went a proud independence of spirit, intolerant of patronage,\r\ncareless of titular honours, indifferent to the accumulation of worldly\r\nwealth. He cared little even for recognition of his work. \"If I had 400\r\npounds a year\" [A sum which might have supported a bachelor, but was\r\nentirely inadequate to the needs of a large family.], he exclaimed at\r\nthe outset of his career, \"I should be content to work anonymously for\r\nthe advancement of science.\" The only recognition he considered worth\r\nhaving, was that of the scientific world; yet so little did he seek it,\r\nso little insist on questions of priority, that, as Professor Howes\r\ntells me, there are at South Kensington among the mass of unpublished\r\ndrawings from dissections made by him, many which show that he had\r\narrived at discoveries which afterwards brought credit to other\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nHe was as ready to disclaim for himself any merits which really\r\nbelonged to his predecessors, whether philosophical or scientific. He\r\nwas too well read in their works not to be aware of the debt owed them\r\nby his own generation, and he reminded the world how little the\r\nscientific insight of Goethe, for instance, or the solid labours of\r\nBuffon or Reaumur or Lamarck, deserved oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe only point on which he did claim recognition was the honesty of his\r\nmotives. He was incapable of doing anything underhand, and he could not\r\nbear even the appearance of such conduct towards his friends, or those\r\nwith whom he had business relations. In such cases he always took the\r\nbull by the horns, acknowledged an oversight or explained what was\r\ncapable of misunderstanding. The choice between Edward Forbes and\r\nHooker for the Royal Society's medal, or the explanations to Mr.\r\nSpencer for not joining a social reform league of which the latter was\r\na prominent member, will serve as instances.]\r\n\r\nThe most considerable difference I note among men [he wrote], is not in\r\ntheir readiness to fall into error, but in their readiness to\r\nacknowledge these inevitable lapses.\r\n\r\n[For himself, he let no personal feelings stand in the way when fact\r\nnegatived his theories: once convinced that they were untenable, he\r\ngave up Bathybius and the European origin of the Horse without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThe regard in which he was held by his friends was such that he was\r\nsometimes appealed to by both parties in a dispute. He was a man to be\r\ntrusted with the confidence of his friends.] \"Yes, you are quite right\r\nabout 'loyal,'\" [he writes to Mr. Knowles], \"I love my friends and hate\r\nmy enemies--which may not be in accordance with the Gospel, but I have\r\nfound it a good wearing creed for honest men.\" [But he only regarded as\r\n\"enemies\" those whom he found to be double-dealers, shufflers,\r\ninsincere, untrustworthy; a fair opponent he respected, and he could\r\nagree to differ with a friend without altering his friendship.\r\n\r\nA lifelong impression of him was thus summed up by Dr. A.R. Wallace:--\r\n\r\nI find that he was my junior by two years, yet he has always seemed to\r\nme to be the older, mainly no doubt, because from the very first time I\r\nsaw him (now more than forty years ago), I recognised his vast\r\nsuperiority in ability, in knowledge, and in all those qualities that\r\nenable a man to take a foremost place in the world. I owe him thanks\r\nfor much kindness and for assistance always cordially given, and\r\nalthough we had many differences of opinion, I never received from him\r\na harsh or unkind word.\r\n\r\nTo those who could only judge him from his controversial literature, or\r\nfrom a formal business meeting, he often appeared hard and\r\nunsympathetic, but never to those who saw beneath the surface. In\r\npersonal intercourse, if he disliked a man--and a strong individuality\r\nhas strong likes and dislikes--he would merely veil his feelings under\r\na superabundant politeness of the chilliest kind; but to any one\r\nadmitted to his friendship he was sympathy itself. And thus, although I\r\nhave heard him say that his friends, in the fullest sense of the word,\r\ncould be reckoned on the fingers of one hand, the impression he made\r\nupon all who came within the circle of his friendship was such that\r\nquite a number felt themselves to possess his intimacy, and one wrote,\r\nafter his death: \"His many private friends are almost tempted to forget\r\nthe public loss, in thinking of the qualities which so endeared him to\r\nthem all.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the speculative and the practical sides of his intellect were\r\nstrongly developed. On the one hand, he had an intense love of\r\nknowledge, the desire to attain true knowledge of facts, and to\r\norganise them in their true relations. His contributions to pure\r\nscience never fail to illustrate both these tendencies. His earlier\r\nresearches brought to light new facts in animal life, and new ideas as\r\nto the affinities of the creatures he studied; his later investigations\r\nwere coloured by Darwin's views, and in return contributed no little\r\ndirect evidence in favour of evolution. But while the progress of the\r\nevolution theory in England owed more to his clear and unwearied\r\nexposition than to any other cause, while from the first he had\r\nindicated the points, such as the causes of sterility and variation,\r\nwhich must be cleared up by further investigation in order to complete\r\nthe Darwinian theory, he did not add another to the many speculations\r\nsince put forward.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, intense as was his love of pure knowledge, it was\r\nbalanced by his unceasing desire to apply that knowledge in the\r\nguidance of life. Always feeling that science was not solely for the\r\nmen of science, but for the people, his constant object was to help the\r\nstruggling world to ideas which should help them to think truly and so\r\nto live rightly. It is still true, he declared, that the people perish\r\nfor want of knowledge. \"If I am to be remembered at all,\" he writes\r\n(see volume 2), \"I should like to be remembered as one who did his best\r\nto help the people.\" And again, he says in his Autobiographical Sketch,\r\nthat other marks of success were as nothing if he could hope that he\r\n\"had somewhat helped that movement of opinion which has been called the\r\nNew Reformation.\"\r\n\r\nThis kind of aim in his work, of taking up the most fruitful idea of\r\nhis time and bringing it home to all, is typified by his remark as he\r\nentered New York harbour on his visit to America in 1876, and watched\r\nthe tugs hard at work as they traversed the bay.] \"If I were not a\r\nman,\" [he said], \"I think I should like to be a tug.\"\r\n\r\n[Two incidents may be cited to show that he did not entirely fail of\r\nappreciation among those whom he tried to help. Speaking of the year\r\n1874, Professor Mivart writes (\"Reminiscences of T.H. Huxley,\"\r\n\"Nineteenth Century\", December 1897.)\r\n\r\nI recollect going with him and Mr. John Westlake, Q.C., to a meeting of\r\nartisans in the Blackfriars Road, to whom he gave a friendly address.\r\nHe felt a strong interest in working-men, and was much beloved by them.\r\nOn one occasion, having taken a cab home, on his arrival there, when he\r\nheld out his fare to the cabman, the latter replied, \"Oh no, Professor,\r\nI have had too much pleasure and profit from hearing you lecture to\r\ntake any money from your pocket--proud to have driven you, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe other is from a letter to the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" of September 20,\r\n1892, from Mr. Raymond Blaythwayt, on \"The Uses of Sentiment\":--\r\n\r\nOnly to-day I had a most striking instance of sentiment come beneath my\r\nnotice. I was about to enter my house, when a plain, simply-dressed\r\nworking-man came up to me with a note in his hand, and touching his\r\nhat, he said, \"I think this is for you, sir,\" and then he added, \"Will\r\nyou give me the envelope, sir, as a great favour?\" I looked at it, and\r\nseeing it bore the signature of Professor Huxley, I replied, \"Certainly\r\nI will; but why do you ask for it?\" \"Well,\" said he, \"it's got\r\nProfessor Huxley's signature, and it will be something for me to show\r\nmy mates and keep for my children. He have done me and my like a lot of\r\ngood; no man more.\"\r\n\r\nIn practical administration, his judgment of men, his rapid perception\r\nof the essential points at issue, his observance of the necessary\r\nlimits of official forms, combined with the greatest possible\r\nelasticity within these limits, made him extremely successful.\r\n\r\nAs Professor (writes the late Professor Jeffery Parker), Huxley's rule\r\nwas characterised by what is undoubtedly the best policy for the head\r\nof a department. To a new subordinate, \"The General,\" as he was always\r\ncalled, was rather stern and exacting, but when once he was convinced\r\nthat his man was to be trusted, he practically let him take his own\r\ncourse; never interfered in matters of detail, accepted suggestions\r\nwith the greatest courtesy and good humour, and was always ready with a\r\nkindly and humorous word of encouragement in times of difficulty. I was\r\nonce grumbling to him about how hard it was to carry on the work of the\r\nlaboratory through a long series of November fogs, \"when neither sun\r\nnor stars in many days appeared.\"] \"Never mind, Parker,\" [he said,\r\ninstantly capping my quotation], \"cast four anchors out of the stern\r\nand wish for day.\"\r\n\r\n[Nothing, indeed, better illustrates this willingness to listen to\r\nsuggested improvements than the inversion of the order of studies in\r\nthe biological course which he inaugurated in 1872, namely, the\r\nsubstitution of the anatomy of a vertebrate for the microscopic\r\nexamination of a unicellular organism as the opening study. This was\r\nentirely Parker's doing. \"As one privileged at the time to play a minor\r\npart,\" writes Professor Howes (\"Nature\" January 6, 1898 page 228), \"I\r\nwell recall the determination in Parker's mind that the change was\r\ndesirable, and in Huxley's, that it was not. Again and again did Parker\r\nappeal in vain, until at last, on the morning of October 2, 1878, he\r\ntriumphed.\"\r\n\r\nOn his students he made a deep and lasting impression.\r\n\r\nHis lectures (writes Jeffery Parker) were like his writings, luminously\r\nclear, without the faintest disposition to descend to the level of his\r\naudience; eloquent, but with no trace of the empty rhetoric which so\r\noften does duty for that quality; full of a high seriousness, but with\r\nno suspicion of pedantry; lightened by an occasional epigram or flashes\r\nof caustic humour, but with none of the small jocularity in which it is\r\nsuch a temptation to a lecturer to indulge. As one listened to him one\r\nfelt that comparative anatomy was indeed worthy of the devotion of a\r\nlife, and that to solve a morphological problem was as fine a thing as\r\nto win a battle. He was an admirable draughtsman, and his blackboard\r\nillustrations were always a great feature of his lectures, especially\r\nwhen, to show the relation of two animal types, he would, by a few\r\nrapid strokes and smudges, evolve the one into the other before our\r\neyes. He seemed to have a real affection for some of the specimens\r\nillustrating his lectures, and would handle them in a peculiarly loving\r\nmanner; when he was lecturing on man, for instance, he would sometimes\r\nthrow his arm over the shoulder of the skeleton beside him and take its\r\nhand, as if its silent companionship were an inspiration. To me his\r\nlectures before his small class at Jermyn Street or South Kensington\r\nwere almost more impressive than the discourses at the Royal\r\nInstitution, where for an hour and a half he poured forth a stream of\r\ndignified, earnest, sincere words in perfect literary form, and without\r\nthe assistance of a note.\r\n\r\nAnother description is from the pen of an old pupil in the autumn of\r\n1876, Professor H. Fairfield Osborn, of Columbia College:--\r\n\r\nHuxley, as a teacher, can never be forgotten by any of his students. He\r\nentered the lecture-room promptly as the clock was striking nine (In\r\nmost years the lectures began at ten.), rather quickly, and with his\r\nhead bent forward \"as if oppressive with its mind.\" He usually glanced\r\nattention to his class of about ninety, and began speaking before he\r\nreached his chair. He spoke between his lips, but with perfectly clear\r\nanalysis, with thorough interest, and with philosophic insight which\r\nwas far above the average of his students. He used very few charts, but\r\nhandled the chalk with great skill, sketching out the anatomy of an\r\nanimal as if it were a transparent object. As in Darwin's face, and as\r\nin Erasmus Darwin's or Buffon's, and many other anatomists with a\r\nstrong sense of form, his eyes were heavily overhung by a projecting\r\nforehead and eyebrows, and seemed at times to look inward. His lips\r\nwere firm and closely set, with the expression of positiveness, and the\r\nother feature which most marked him was the very heavy mass of hair\r\nfalling over his forehead, which he would frequently stroke or toss\r\nback. Occasionally he would light up the monotony of anatomical\r\ndescription by a bit of humour.\r\n\r\nHuxley was the father of modern laboratory instruction; but in 1879 he\r\nwas so intensely engrossed with his own researches that he very seldom\r\ncame through the laboratory, which was ably directed by T. Jeffery\r\nParker, assisted by Howes and W. Newton Parker, all of whom are now\r\nprofessors, Howes having succeeded to Huxley's chair. Each visit,\r\ntherefore, inspired a certain amount of terror, which was really\r\nunwarranted, for Huxley always spoke in the kindest tones to his\r\nstudents, although sometimes he could not resist making fun at their\r\nexpense. There was an Irish student who sat in front of me, whose\r\nanatomical drawings in water-colour were certainly most remarkable\r\nproductions. Huxley, in turning over his drawing-book, paused at a\r\nlarge blur, under which was carefully inscribed, \"sheep's liver,\" and\r\nsmilingly said], \"I am glad to know that is a liver; it reminds me as\r\nmuch of Cologne cathedral in a fog as of anything I have ever seen\r\nbefore.\" [Fortunately the nationality of the student enabled him to\r\nfully appreciate the humour.\r\n\r\nThe same note is sounded in Professor Mivart's description of these\r\nlectures in his Reminiscences:--\r\n\r\nThe great value of Huxley's anatomical ideas, and the admirable\r\nclearness with which he explained them, led me in the autumn of 1861 to\r\nseek admission as a student to his course of lectures at the School of\r\nMines in Jermyn Street. When I entered his small room there to make\r\nthis request, he was giving the finishing touches to a dissection of\r\npart of the nervous system of a skate, worked out for the benefit of\r\nhis students. He welcomed my application with the greatest cordiality,\r\nsave that he insisted I should be only an honorary student, or rather,\r\nshould assist at his lectures as a friend. I availed myself of his\r\npermission on the very next day, and subsequently attended almost all\r\nhis lectures there and elsewhere, so that he one day said to me, \"I\r\nshall call you my 'constant reader.'\" To be such a reader was to me an\r\ninestimable privilege, and so I shall ever consider it. I have heard\r\nmany men lecture, but I never heard any one lecture as did Professor\r\nHuxley. He was my very ideal of a lecturer. Distinct in utterance, with\r\nan agreeable voice, lucid as it was possible to be in exposition, with\r\nadmirably chosen language, sufficiently rapid, yet never hurried, often\r\nimpressive in manner, yet never otherwise than completely natural, and\r\nsometimes allowing his audience a glimpse of that rich fund of humour\r\never ready to well forth when occasion permitted, sometimes accompanied\r\nwith an extra gleam in his bright dark eyes, sometimes expressed with a\r\ndryness and gravity of look which gave it a double zest.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the first time I saw him enter his lecture-room.\r\nHe came in rapidly, yet without bustle, and as the clock struck, a\r\nbrief glance at his audience and then at once to work. He had the\r\nexcellent habit of beginning each lecture (save, of course, the first)\r\nwith a recapitulation of the main points of the preceding one. The\r\ncourse was amply illustrated by excellent coloured diagrams, which, I\r\nbelieve, he had made; but still more valuable were the chalk sketches\r\nhe would draw on the blackboard with admirable facility, while he was\r\ntalking, his rapid, dexterous strokes quickly building up an organism\r\nin our minds, simultaneously through ear and eye. The lecture over, he\r\nwas ever ready to answer questions, and I often admired his patience in\r\nexplaining points which there was no excuse for any one not having\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nStill more was I struck with the great pleasure which he showed when he\r\nsaw that some special points of his teaching had not only been\r\ncomprehended, but had borne fruit, by their suggestiveness in an\r\nappreciative mind.\r\n\r\nTo one point I desire specially to bear witness. There were persons who\r\ndreaded sending young men to him, fearing lest their young friends'\r\nreligious beliefs should be upset by what they might hear said. For\r\nyears I attended his lectures, but never once did I hear him make use\r\nof his position as a teacher to inculcate, or even hint at, his own\r\ntheological views, or to depreciate or assail what might be supposed to\r\nbe the religion of his hearers. No one could have behaved more loyally\r\nin that respect, and a proof that I thought so is that I subsequently\r\nsent my own son to be his pupil at South Kensington, where his\r\nexperience confirmed what had previously been my own.\r\n\r\nAs to science, I learnt more from him in two years than I had acquired\r\nin any previous decade of biological study.\r\n\r\nThe picture is completed by Professor Howes in the \"Students' Magazine\"\r\nof the Royal College of Science:--\r\n\r\nAs a class lecturer Huxley was facile princeps, and only those who were\r\nprivileged to sit under him can form a conception of his delivery.\r\nClear, deliberate, never hesitant nor unduly emphatic, never\r\nrepetitional, always logical, his every word told. Great, however, as\r\nwere his class lectures, his working-men's were greater. Huxley was a\r\nfirm believer in the \"distillatio per ascensum\" of scientific knowledge\r\nand culture, and spared no pains in approaching the artisan and\r\nso-called \"working classes.\" He gave the workmen of his best. The\r\nsubstance of his \"Man's Place in Nature\", one of the most successful\r\nand popular of his writings, and of his \"Crayfish\", perhaps the most\r\nperfect zoological treatise ever published, was first communicated to\r\nthem. In one of the last conversations I had with him, I asked his\r\nviews on the desirability of discontinuing the workmen's lectures at\r\nJermyn Street, since the development of working-men's colleges and\r\ninstitutes is regarded by some to have rendered their continuance\r\nunnecessary. He replied, almost with indignation], \"With our central\r\nsituation and resources, we ought to be in a position to give the\r\nworkmen that which they cannot get elsewhere,\" [adding that he would\r\ndeeply deplore any such discontinuance.\r\n\r\nAnd now, a word or two concerning Huxley's personal conduct towards his\r\npupils, hearers, and subordinates.\r\n\r\nAs an examiner he was most just, aiming only to ascertain the\r\nexaminee's knowledge of fundamentals, his powers of work, and the\r\nmanner in which he had been taught. A country school lad came near the\r\nboundary line in the examination; though generally weak, his worst\r\nfault was a confusion of the parts of the heart. In his description of\r\nthat organ he had transposed the valves. On appeal, Huxley let him\r\nthrough, observing, most characteristically, \"Poor little beggar, I\r\nnever got them correctly myself until I reflected that a bishop was\r\nnever in the right.\"  (The \"mitral\" valve being on the left side.)\r\nAgain, a student of more advanced years, of the \"mugging\" type, who had\r\ncome off with flying colours in an elementary examination, showed signs\r\nof uneasiness as the advanced one approached. \"Stick an observation\r\ninto him,\" said Huxley. It was stuck, and acted like a stiletto, a jump\r\ninto the air and utter collapse being the result.\r\n\r\nWith his hearers Huxley was most sympathetic. He always assumed\r\nabsolute ignorance on their part, and took nothing for granted. (This\r\nwas a maxim on lecturing, adopted from Faraday.) When time permitted,\r\nhe would remain after a lecture to answer questions; and in connection\r\nwith his so doing his wonderful power of gauging and rising to a\r\nsituation, once came out most forcibly. Turning to a student, he asked,\r\n\"Well, I hope you understood it all.\" \"All, sir, but one part, during\r\nwhich you stood between me and the blackboard,\" was the reply: the\r\nrejoinder, \"I did my best to make myself clear, but could not render\r\nmyself transparent.\" Quick of comprehension and of action, he would\r\nstand no nonsense. The would-be teacher who, wholly unfitted by nature\r\nfor educational work, was momentarily dismissed, realised this, let us\r\nhope to his advantage. And the man suspected of taking notes of\r\nHuxley's lectures for publication unauthorised, probably learned the\r\nlesson of his life, on being reminded that, in the first place, a\r\nlecture was the property of the person who delivered it, and, in the\r\nsecond, he was not the first person who had mistaken aspiration for\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nThough candid, Huxley was never unkind...\r\n\r\nHuxley never forgot a kindly action, never forsook a friend, nor\r\nallowed a labour to go unrewarded. In testimony to his sympathy to\r\nthose about him and his self-sacrifice for the cause of science, it may\r\nbe stated that in the old days, when the professors took the fees and\r\ndisbursed the working expenses of the laboratories, he, doing this at a\r\nloss, would refund the fees of students whose position, from friendship\r\nor special circumstances, was exceptional.\r\n\r\nAs for his lectures and addresses to the public, they used to be\r\nthronged by crowds of attentive listeners.\r\n\r\nHuxley's public addresses (writes Professor Osborn) always gave me the\r\nimpression of being largely impromptu; but he once told me: \"I always\r\nthink out carefully every word I am going to say. There is no greater\r\ndanger than the so-called INSPIRATION OF THE MOMENT, which leads you to\r\nsay something which is not exactly true, or which you would regret\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nMr. G.W. Smalley has also left a striking description of him as a\r\nlecturer in the seventies and early eighties.\r\n\r\nI used always to admire the simple and business-like way in which\r\nHuxley made his entry on great occasions. He hated anything like\r\ndisplay, and would have none of it. At the Royal Institution, more than\r\nalmost anywhere else, the lecturer, on whom the concentric circles of\r\nspectators in their steep amphitheatre look down, focuses the gaze.\r\nHuxley never seemed aware that anybody was looking at him. From\r\nself-consciousness he was, here as elsewhere, singularly free, as from\r\nself-assertion. He walked in through the door on the left, as if he\r\nwere entering his own laboratory. In these days he bore scarcely a mark\r\nof age. He was in the full vigour of manhood and looked the man he was.\r\nFaultlessly dressed--the rule in the Royal Institution is evening\r\ncostume--with a firm step and easy bearing, he took his place\r\napparently without a thought of the people who were cheering him. To\r\nhim it was an anniversary. He looked, and he probably was, the master.\r\nSurrounded as he was by the celebrities of science and the ornaments of\r\nLondon drawing-rooms, there was none who had quite the same kind of\r\nintellectual ascendancy which belonged to him. The square forehead, the\r\nsquare jaw, the tense lines of the mouth, the deep flashing dark eyes,\r\nthe impression of something more than strength he gave you, an\r\nimpression of sincerity, of solid force, of immovability, yet with the\r\ngentleness arising from the serene consciousness of his strength--all\r\nthis belonged to Huxley and to him alone. The first glance magnetised\r\nhis audience. The eyes were those of one accustomed to command, of one\r\nhaving authority, and not fearing on occasion to use it. The hair swept\r\ncarelessly away from the broad forehead and grew rather long behind,\r\nyet the length did not suggest, as it often does, effeminacy. He was\r\nmasculine in everything--look, gesture, speech. Sparing of gesture,\r\nsparing of emphasis, careless of mere rhetorical or oratorical art, he\r\nhad nevertheless the secret of the highest art of all, whether in\r\noratory or whatever else--he had simplicity. The force was in the\r\nthought and the diction, and he needed no other. The voice was rather\r\ndeep, low, but quite audible, at times sonorous, and always full. He\r\nused the chest-notes. His manner here, in the presence of this select\r\nand rather limited audience--for the theatre of the Royal Institution\r\nholds, I think, less than a thousand people--was exactly the same as\r\nbefore a great company whom he addressed at [Liverpool], as President\r\nof the British Association for the Advancement of Science. I remember\r\ngoing late to that, and having to sit far back, yet hearing every word\r\neasily; and there too the feeling was the same, that he had mastered\r\nhis audience, taken possession of them, and held them to the end in an\r\nunrelaxing grip, as a great actor at his best does. There was nothing\r\nof the actor about him, except that he knew how to stand still, but\r\nmasterful he ever was.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of his last illness, he regularly breakfasted at eight,\r\nand avoided, as far as possible, going out to that meal, a \"detestable\r\nhabit\" as he called it, which put him off for the whole day. He left\r\nthe house about nine, and from that time till midnight at earliest was\r\nincessantly busy. His regular lectures involved an immensity of labour,\r\nfor he would never make a statement in them which he had not personally\r\nverified by experiment. In the Jermyn Street days he habitually made\r\npreparations to illustrate the points on which he was lecturing, for\r\nhis students had no laboratory in which to work out the things for\r\nthemselves. His lectures to working-men also involved as much careful\r\npreparation as the more conspicuous discourses at the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nThis thoroughness of preparation had no less effect on the teacher than\r\non the taught. He writes to an old pupil:--]\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant when the \"bread cast upon the water\" returns after many\r\ndays; and if the crumbs given in my lectures have had anything to do\r\nwith the success on which I congratulate you, I am very glad.\r\n\r\nI used to say of my own lectures that if nobody else learned anything\r\nfrom them, I did; because I always took a great deal of pains over\r\nthem. But it is none the less satisfactory to find that there WERE\r\nother learners.\r\n\r\n[As for the ordinary course of a day's work, the more fitful energy and\r\nuseless mornings of the earliest period in London were soon left\r\nbehind. He was never one of those portentously early risers who do a\r\nfair day's work before other people are up; there was only one period,\r\nabout 1873, when he had to be specially careful of his health, and,\r\nunder Sir Andrew Clark's regime, took riding exercise for an hour each\r\nday before starting for South Kensington, that he records the fact of\r\ndoing any work before breakfast, and that was letter-writing.\r\n\r\nMuch of the day during the session, and still more when his lectures\r\nwere over, would thus be spent in original research, or in the\r\nexamination and description of fossils in his official duty as\r\nPaleontologist to the Survey. As often as not, there would be a sitting\r\nof some Royal Commission to attend; committees of some learned society;\r\nmeetings or dinners in the evening; if not, there would be an article\r\nto write or proofs to correct. Indeed, the greater part of the work by\r\nwhich the world knows him best was done after dinner, and after a long\r\nday's work in the lecture-room and laboratory.\r\n\r\nHe possessed a wonderful faculty for tearing out the heart of a book,\r\nreading it through at a gallop, but knowing what it said on all the\r\npoints that interested him. Of verbal memory he had very little; in\r\nspite of all his reading I do not believe he knew half a dozen\r\nconsecutive lines of poetry by heart. What he did know was the\r\nsubstance of what an author had written; how it fitted into his own\r\nscheme of knowledge; and where to find any point again when he wished\r\nto cite it.\r\n\r\nIn his biological studies his immense knowledge was firmly fixed in his\r\nmind by practical investigation; as is said above, he would take at\r\nsecond hand nothing for which he vouched in his teaching, and was\r\nalways ready to repeat for himself the experiments of others, which\r\ndetermined questions of interest to him. The citations, analyses, maps,\r\nwith which he frequently accompanied his reading, were all part of the\r\nsame method of acquiring facts and setting them in order within his\r\nmind. So careful, indeed, was he in giving nothing at second hand, that\r\none of his scientific friends reproached him with wasting his time upon\r\nunnecessary scientific work, to which competent investigators had\r\nalready given the stamp of their authority. \"Poor--,\" was his comment\r\nafterwards, \"if that is his own practice, his work will never live.\" On\r\nthe literary side, he was omnivorous--consuming everything, as Mr.\r\nSpencer put it, from fairy tales to the last volume on metaphysics.\r\n\r\nUnlike Darwin, to whom scientific research was at length the only thing\r\nengrossing enough to make him oblivious of his never-ending ill-health,\r\nto the gradual exclusion of other interests, literary and artistic,\r\nHuxley never lost his delight in literature or in art. He had a keen\r\neye for a picture or a piece of sculpture, for, in addition to the\r\ndraughtsman's and anatomist's sense of form, he had a strong sense of\r\ncolour. To good music he was always susceptible. (To one breaking in\r\nupon him at certain afternoon hours in his room at South Kensington, \"a\r\nwhiff of the pipe\" (writes Professor Howes), \"and a snatch of some\r\nchoice melody or a Bach's fugue, were the not infrequent welcome.\") He\r\nplayed no instrument; as a young man, however, he used to sing a\r\nlittle, but his voice, though true, was never strong. But he had small\r\nleisure to devote to art. On his holidays he would sometimes sketch\r\nwith a firm and rapid touch. His illustrations to the \"Cruise of the\r\nRattlesnake\" show what his untrained capacities were. But to go to a\r\nconcert or opera was rare after middle life; to go to the theatre rarer\r\nstill, much as he appreciated a good play. His time was too deeply\r\nmortgaged; and in later life, the deafness which grew upon him added a\r\nnew difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn poetry he was sensitive both to matter and form. One school of\r\nmodern poetry he dismissed as \"sensuous caterwauling\": a busy man, time\r\nand patience failed him to wade through the trivial discursiveness of\r\nso much of Wordsworth's verse; thus unfortunately he never realised the\r\nfull value of a poet in whom the mass of ore bears so large a\r\nproportion to the pure metal. Shelley was too diffuse to be among his\r\nfirst favourites; but for simple beauty, Keats; for that, and for the\r\ncomprehension of the meaning of modern science, Tennyson; for strength\r\nand feeling, Browning as represented by his earlier poems--these were\r\nthe favourites among the moderns. He knew his eighteenth-century\r\nclassics, but knew better his Milton and his Shakespeare, to whom he\r\nturned with ever-increasing satisfaction, as men do who have lived a\r\nfull life.\r\n\r\nHis early acquaintance with German had given him a lasting admiration\r\nof the greatest representatives of German literature, Goethe above all,\r\nin whose writings he found a moral grandeur to be ranked with that of\r\nthe Hebrew prophets. Eager to read Dante in the original, he spent much\r\nof his leisure on board the \"Rattlesnake\" in making out the Italian\r\nwith the aid of a dictionary, and in this way came to know the beauties\r\nof the \"Divina Commedia\". On the other hand, it was a scientific\r\ninterest which led him in later life to take up his Greek, though one\r\nuse he put it to was to read Homer in the original.\r\n\r\nThough he was a great novel-reader, and, as he grew older, would always\r\nhave a novel ready to take up for a while in the evening, his chief\r\nreading, in German and French as well as English, was philosophy and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHis recreations were, as a rule, literary, and consisted in a change of\r\nmental occupation. The only times I can remember his playing an outdoor\r\ngame are in the late sixties, when he started his elder children at\r\ncricket on the common at Littlehampton, and in 1871 when he played golf\r\nat St. Andrews. When first married, he promised his wife to reserve\r\nSaturday afternoons for recreation, and constantly went with her to the\r\nElla concerts. About 1861 she urged him to take exercise by joining Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer at racquets; but the pressure of work before long\r\nabsorbed all his time. In his youth he was extremely fond of chess, and\r\nplayed eagerly with his fellow-students at Charing Cross Hospital or\r\nwith his messmates on board the \"Rattlesnake\". But after he taught me\r\nthe game, somewhere about 1869 or 1870, I do not think he ever found\r\ntime for it again.\r\n\r\nHis principal exercise was walking during the holidays. In his earlier\r\ndays especially, when overwrought by the stress of his life in London,\r\nhe used to go off with a friend for a week's walking tour in Wales or\r\nthe Lakes, in Brittany or the Eifel country, or in summer for a longer\r\ntrip to Switzerland. In this way he \"burnt up the waste products,\" as\r\nhe would say, of his town life, and came back fresh for a new spell of\r\nunintermittent work.\r\n\r\nBut on the whole, the amount of exercise he took was insufficient for\r\nhis bodily needs. Even the riding prescribed for him when he first\r\nbroke down, became irksome, and was not continued very long, although\r\nhis bodily machine was such as could only be kept in perfect working\r\norder by more exercise than he would give. His physique was not adapted\r\nto burn up the waste without special stimulus. I remember once, as he\r\nand I were walking up Beachy Head, we passed a man with a splendid big\r\nchest. \"Ah,\" said my father regretfully, \"if I had only had a chest\r\nlike that, what a lot of work I could have done.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1872, he built his new house in Marlborough Place, my father\r\nbargained for two points; one, that each member of the family should\r\nhave a corner of his or her own, where, as he used to say, it would be\r\npossible to \"consume their own smoke\"; the other, that the common\r\nliving-rooms should be of ample size. Thus from 1874 onwards he was\r\nenabled to see something of his many friends who would come as far as\r\nSt. John's Wood on a Sunday evening. No formal invitation for a special\r\nday was needed. The guests came, before supper or after, sometimes\r\nmore, sometimes fewer, as on any ordinary at-home day. There was a\r\nsimple informal meal at 6.30 or 7 o'clock, which called itself by no\r\nmore dignified name than high tea--was, in fact, a cold supper with\r\nvarying possibilities in the direction of dinner or tea. It was a\r\nchance medley of old and young--friends of the parents and friends of\r\nthe children, but all ultimately centring round the host himself, whose\r\nend of the table never flagged for conversation, grave or gay.\r\n\r\nAfterwards talk would go on in the drawing-room, or, on warm summer\r\nevenings, in the garden--nothing very extensive, but boasting a lawn\r\nwith an old apple-tree at the further end, and in the borders such\r\nflowers and trees as endure London air. Later on, there was almost sure\r\nto be some music, to which my father himself was devoted. His daughters\r\nsang; a musical friend would be there; Mr. Herbert Spencer, a frequent\r\nvisitor, was an authority on music. Once only do I recollect any other\r\nform of entertainment, and that was an occasion when Sir Henry Irving,\r\nthen not long established at the Lyceum, was present and recited\r\n\"Eugene Aram\" with great effect.\r\n\r\nIn his \"London Letters\" Mr. G.W. Smalley has recorded his impressions\r\nof these evenings (Another interesting account from the same pen is to\r\nbe found in the article \"Mr. Huxley,\" Scribner's Magazine, October\r\n1895.), at which he was often present:--\r\n\r\nThere used to be Sunday evening dinners and parties in Marlborough\r\nPlace, to which people from many other worlds than those of abstract\r\nscience were bidden; where talk was to be heard of a kind rare in any\r\nworld. It was scientific at times, but subdued to the necessities of\r\nthe occasion; speculative, yet kept within such bounds that bishop or\r\narchbishop might have listened without offence; political even, and\r\nstill not commonplace; literary without pretence, and when artistic,\r\nfree from affectation.\r\n\r\nThere and elsewhere Mr. Huxley easily took the lead if he cared to, or\r\nif challenged. Nobody was more ready in a greater variety of topics,\r\nand if they were scientific it was almost always another who introduced\r\nthem. Unlike some of his comrades of the Royal Society, he was of\r\nopinion that man does not live by science alone, and nothing came amiss\r\nto him. All his life long he has been in the front of the battle that\r\nhas raged between science and--not religion, but theology in its more\r\ndogmatic form. Even in private the alarm of war is sometimes heard, and\r\nMr. Huxley is not a whit less formidable as a disputant across the\r\ntable than with pen in hand. Yet an angry man must be very angry indeed\r\nbefore he could be angry with this adversary. He disarmed his enemies\r\nwith an amiable grace that made defeat endurable if not entirely\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nAs for his method of handling scientific subjects in conversation:--\r\n\r\nHe has the same quality, the same luminous style of exposition, with\r\nwhich his printed books have made all readers in America and England\r\nfamiliar. Yet it has more than that. You cannot listen to him without\r\nthinking more of the speaker than of his science, more of the solid\r\nbeautiful nature than of the intellectual gifts, more of his manly\r\nsimplicity and sincerity than of all his knowledge and his long\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nBut his personality left the deepest impression, perhaps, upon those\r\nwho studied under him and worked with him longest, before taking their\r\nplace elsewhere in the front ranks of biological science.\r\n\r\nWith him (Professor A. Hubrecht (Of Utrecht University.) writes), we\r\nhis younger disciples, always felt that in acute criticism and vast\r\nlearning nobody surpassed him, but still what we yet more admired than\r\nhis learning was his wisdom. It was always a delight to read any new\r\narticle or essay from his pen, but it was an ever so much higher\r\ndelight to hear him talk for five minutes. His was the most beautiful\r\nand the most manly intellect I ever knew of.\r\n\r\nSo, too, Professor E. Ray Lankester:--\r\n\r\nThere has been no man or woman whom I have met on my journey through\r\nlife, whom I have loved and regarded as I have him, and I feel that the\r\nworld has shrunk and become a poor thing, now that his splendid spirit\r\nand delightful presence are gone from it. Ever since I was a little boy\r\nhe has been my ideal and hero.\r\n\r\nWhile the late Jeffery Parker concludes his Recollections with these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\nWhether a professor is usually a hero to his demonstrator I cannot say;\r\nI only know that, looking back across an interval of many years and a\r\ndistance of half the circumference of the globe, I have never ceased to\r\nbe impressed with the manliness and sincerity of his character, his\r\ncomplete honesty of purpose, his high moral standard, his scorn of\r\neverything mean or shifty, his firm determination to speak what he held\r\nto be truth at whatever cost of popularity. And for these things \"I\r\nloved the man, and do honour to his memory, on this side idolatry, as\r\nmuch as any.\"\r\n\r\nEven those who scarcely knew him apart from his books, underwent the\r\ninfluence of that \"determination to speak what he held to be truth.\" I\r\nmay perhaps be allowed to quote in illustration two passages from\r\nletters to myself--one written by a woman, the other by a man:--\r\n\r\n\"'The surest-footed guide' is exactly true, to my feeling. Everybody\r\nelse, among the great, used to disappoint one somewhere. He--never!\"\r\n\r\n\"He was so splendidly brave that one can never repay one's debt to him\r\nfor his example. He made all pretence about religious belief, and the\r\nkind of half-thinking things out, and putting up in a slovenly way with\r\nhalf-formed conclusions, seem the base thing which it really is.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.16.\r\n\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n[I have often regretted that I did not regularly take notes of my\r\nfather's conversation, which was striking, not so much for the manner\r\nof it--though that was at once copious and crisp,--as for the strength\r\nand substance of what he said. Yet the striking fact, the bit of\r\nphilosophy, the closely knitted argument, were perfectly unstudied, and\r\nas in other most interesting talkers, dropped into the flow of\r\nconversation as naturally as would the more ordinary experiences of\r\nless richly stored minds.\r\n\r\nHowever, in January 1895 I was staying at Eastbourne, and jotted down\r\nseveral fragments of talk as nearly as I could recollect them.\r\nConversation not immediately noted down I hardly dare venture upon,\r\nsave perhaps such an unforgettable phrase as this, which I remember his\r\nusing one day as we walked on the hills near Great Hampden]:--\"It is\r\none of the most saddening things in life that, try as we may, we can\r\nnever be certain of making people happy, whereas we can almost always\r\nbe certain of making them unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n[JANUARY 16.\r\n\r\nAt lunch he spoke of Dr. Louis Robinson's experiments upon simian\r\ncharacteristics in new-born children. He himself had called attention\r\nbefore to the incurved feet of infants, but the power of hanging by the\r\nhands was a new and important discovery. (Professor H.F. Osborn tells\r\nthis story of his:--\"When a fond mother calls upon me to admire her\r\nbaby, I never fail to respond; and while cooing appropriately, I take\r\nadvantage of an opportunity to gently ascertain whether the soles of\r\nits feet turn in, and tend to support my theory of arboreal descent.\")\r\n\r\nHe expressed his disgust with a certain member of the Psychical\r\nResearch Society for his attitude towards spiritualism]: \"He doesn't\r\nbelieve in it, yet lends it the cover of his name. He is one of the\r\npeople who talk of the 'possibility' of the thing, who think the\r\ndifficulties of disproving a thing as good as direct evidence in its\r\nfavour.\"\r\n\r\n[He thought it hard to be attacked for] \"the contempt of the man of\r\nscience\" [when he was dragged into debate by Mr. Andrew Lang's \"Cock\r\nLane and Common Sense\", he saying in a very polite letter}: \"I am\r\ncontent to leave Mr. Lang the Cock Lane Ghost if I may keep common\r\nsense.\" \"After all,\" [he added], \"when a man has been through life and\r\nmade his judgments, he must have come to a decision that there are some\r\nsubjects it is not worth while going into.\"\r\n\r\nJANUARY 18.\r\n\r\nI referred to an article in the last \"Nineteenth Century\", and he\r\nsaid]:--\"As soon as I saw it, I wrote, 'Knowles, my friend, you don't\r\ndraw me this time. If a man goes on attributing statements to me which\r\nI have shown over and over again--giving chapter and verse--to be the\r\ncontrary of what I did say, it is no good saying any more.'\"\r\n\r\n[But would not this course of silence leave the mass of the British\r\npublic believing the statements of the writer?]\r\n\r\n\"The mass of the public will believe in ten years precisely the\r\nopposite of what they believe now. If a man is not a fool, it does him\r\nno harm to be believed one. If he really is a fool, it does matter.\r\nThere never was book so derided and scoffed at as my first book, \"Man's\r\nPlace in Nature\", but it was true, and I don't know I was any the worse\r\nfor the ridicule.\r\n\r\n\"People call me fond of controversy, but, as a fact, for the last\r\ntwenty years at all events, I have never entered upon a controversy\r\nwithout some further purpose in view. As to Gladstone and his\r\n\"Impregnable Rock\", it wasn't worth attacking them for themselves; but\r\nit was most important at that moment to shake him in the minds of\r\nsensible men.\r\n\r\n\"The movement of modern philosophy is back towards the position of the\r\nold Ionian philosophers, but strengthened and clarified by sound\r\nscientific ideas. If I publish my criticism on Comte, I should have to\r\nre-write it as a summary of philosophical ideas from the earliest\r\ntimes. The thread of philosophical development is not on the lines\r\nusually laid down for it. It goes from Democritus and the rest to the\r\nEpicureans, and then the Stoics, who tried to reconcile it with popular\r\ntheological ideas, just as was done by the Christian Fathers. In the\r\nMiddle Ages it was entirely lost under the theological theories of the\r\ntime; but reappeared with Spinoza, who, however, muddled it up with a\r\nlot of metaphysics which made him almost unintelligible.\r\n\r\n\"Plato was the founder of all the vague and unsound thinking that has\r\nburdened philosophy, deserting facts for possibilities, and then, after\r\nlong and beautiful stories of what might be, telling you he doesn't\r\nquite believe them himself.\r\n\r\n\"A certain time since it was heresy to breathe a word against Plato;\r\nbut I have a nice story of Sir Henry Holland. He used to have all the\r\nrising young men to breakfast, and turn out their latest ideas. One\r\nmorning I went to breakfast with him, and we got into very intimate\r\nconversation, when he wound up by saying, 'In my opinion, Plato was an\r\nass! But don't tell any one I said so.'\"\r\n\r\nWe talked on geographical teaching; he began by insisting on the need\r\nof a map of the earth (on the true scale) showing the insignificance of\r\nall elevations and depressions on the surface. Secondly, one should\r\ntake any place as centre, and draw about it circles of 50 or 100 miles\r\nradius, and see what lies within them; and note the extent of the\r\ninfluence exerted by the central point. At the same time, one should\r\nalways compare the British Isles to scale. For instance, the Aegean is\r\nabout as big as Britain; while the smallness of Judaea is remarkable.\r\nAfter the Exile, the Jewish part was about as big as the county of\r\nGloucester. How few boys realise this, though they are taught classical\r\ngeography.\r\n\r\n\"The real chosen people were the Greeks. One of the most remarkable\r\nthings about them is not only the smallness, but the late rise of\r\nAttica, whereas Magna Graecia flourished in the eighth century. The\r\nGreeks were doing everything--piracy, trade, fighting, expelling the\r\nPersians. Never was there so large a number of self-governing\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n\"They fell short of the Jews in morality. How curious is the tolerant\r\nattitude of Socrates, like a modern man of the world talking to a young\r\nfellow who runs after the girls. The Jew, however he fell short in\r\nother respects, set himself a certain standard in cleanliness of life,\r\nand would not fall below it. The more creditable to him, because these\r\nvices were the offspring of the Semitic races among whom the Jew lived.\r\n\r\n\"There is a curious similarity between the position of the Jew in\r\nancient times and what it is now. They were procurers and usurers among\r\nthe Gentiles, yet many of them were singularly high-minded and pure.\r\nAll too with an intense clannishness, the secret of their success, and\r\na sense of superiority to the Gentile which would prevent the meanest\r\nJew from sitting at table with a proconsul.\r\n\r\n\"The most remarkable achievement of the Jew was to impose on Europe for\r\neighteen centuries his own superstitions--his ideas of the\r\nsupernatural. Jahveh was no more than Zeus or Milcom; yet the Jew got\r\nestablished the belief in the inspiration of his Bible and his Law. If\r\nI were a Jew, I should have the same contempt as he has for the\r\nChristian who acted in this way towards me, who took my ideas and\r\nscorned me for clinging to them.\"\r\n\r\n[January 21.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening he again declared that it was very hard for a man of\r\npeace like himself to have been dragged into so many controversies.] \"I\r\ndeclare that for the last twenty years I have never attacked, but\r\nalways fought in self-defence, counting Darwin, of course, as part of\r\nmyself, for dear Darwin never could nor would defend himself. Before\r\nthat, I admit I attacked --, but I could not trust the man.\" [A pause.]\r\n\"No, there was one other case, when I attacked without being directly\r\nassailed, and that was Gladstone. But it was good for other reasons. It\r\nhas always astonished me how a man after fifty or sixty years of life\r\namong men could be so ignorant of the best way to handle his materials.\r\nIf he had only read Dana, he would have found his case much better\r\nstated than ever he stated it. He seemed never to have read the leading\r\nauthorities on his own side.\"\r\n\r\n[Speaking of the hesitation shown by the Senate of London University in\r\ngrappling with a threatened obstacle to reform, he remarked]: \"It is\r\nvery strange how most men will do anything to evade responsibility.\"\r\n\r\n[January 23.\r\n\r\nAt dinner the talk turned on plays. Mr. H.A. Jones had sent him\r\n\"Judah\", which he thought good, though] \"there must be some\r\nhostility--except in the very greatest writers--between the dramatic\r\nand the literary faculties. I noticed many points I objected to, but\r\nfelt sure they met with applause. Indeed in the theatre I have noticed\r\nthat what I thought the worst blots on a piece invariably brought down\r\nthe house.\"\r\n\r\n[He remarked how the French, in dramatic just as in artistic matters,\r\nare so much better than the English in composition, in avoiding\r\nanything slipshod in the details, though the English artists draw just\r\nas well and colour perhaps better.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of human character is not actually a fragment of\r\nconversation, though it might almost pass for such; it comes from a\r\nletter to Mrs. W.K. Clifford, of February 10, 1895:--]\r\n\r\nMen, my dear, are very queer animals, a mixture of horse-nervousness,\r\nass-stubbornness and camel-malice--with an angel bobbing about\r\nunexpectedly like the apple in the posset, and when they can do exactly\r\nas they please, they are very hard to drive.\r\n\r\n[Whatever he talked of, his talk never failed to impress those who\r\nconversed with him. One or two such impressions have been recorded. Mr.\r\nWilfrid Ward, whose interests lie chiefly in philosophy and theology,\r\nwas his neighbour at Eastbourne, and in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for\r\nAugust 1896 has given various reminiscences of their friendly\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nHis conversation (he writes) was singularly finished, and (if I may so\r\nexpress it) clean cut; never long-winded or prosy; enlivened by vivid\r\nillustrations. He was an excellent raconteur, and his stories had a\r\nstamp of their own which would have made them always and everywhere\r\nacceptable. His sense of humour and economy of words would have made it\r\nimpossible, had he lived to ninety, that they should ever have been\r\ndisparaged as symptoms of what has been called \"anecdotage.\"\r\n\r\nOne drawback to conversation, however, he began to complain of during\r\nthe later seventies.]\r\n\r\nIt is a great misfortune [he remarked to Professor Osborn] to be deaf\r\nin only one ear. Every time I dine out the lady sitting by my good ear\r\nthinks I am charming, but I make a mortal enemy of the lady on my deaf\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[In ordinary conversation he never plunged at once into deep subjects.\r\nHis welcome to the newcomer was always of the simplest and most\r\nunstudied. He had no mannerisms nor affectation of phrase. He would\r\nbegin at once to talk on everyday topics; an intimate friend he would\r\nperhaps rally upon some standing subject of persiflage. But the\r\nsubsequent course of conversation adapted itself to his company. Deeper\r\nsubjects were reached soon enough by those who cared for them; with\r\nothers he was quite happy to talk of politics or people or his garden,\r\nyet, whatever he touched, never failing to infuse into it an unexpected\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, a typical story was told me by a great friend of\r\nmine, whom we had come to know through his marriage with an early\r\nfriend of the family. \"Going to call at Hodeslea,\" he said, \"I was in\r\nsome trepidation, because I didn't know anything about science or\r\nphilosophy; but when your mother began to talk over old times with my\r\nwife, your father came across the room and sat down by me, and began to\r\ntalk about the dog which we had brought with us. From that he got on to\r\nthe different races of dogs and their origin and connections, all quite\r\nsimply, and not as though to give information, but just to talk about\r\nsomething which obviously interested me. I shall never forget how\r\nextraordinarily kind it was of your father to take all this trouble in\r\nentertaining a complete stranger, and choosing a subject which put me\r\nat my ease at once, while he told me all manner of new and interesting\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nA few more fragments of his conversation have been preserved--the\r\nfollowing by Mr. Wilfrid Ward. Speaking of Tennyson's conversation, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\nDoric beauty is its characteristic--perfect simplicity, without any\r\nornament or anything artificial.\r\n\r\nTelling how he had been to a meeting of the British Museum Trustees, he\r\nsaid:--]\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting, Archbishop Benson helped me on with my great-coat. I\r\nwas QUITE OVERCOME by this species of spiritual investiture. \"Thank\r\nyou, Archbishop,\" I said, \"I feel as if I were receiving the pallium.\"\r\n\r\n[Speaking of two men of letters, with neither of whom he sympathised,\r\nhe once said:--]\r\n\r\nDon't mistake me. One is a thinker and man of letters, the other is\r\nonly a literary man. Erasmus was a man of letters, Gigadibs a literary\r\nman. A.B. is the incarnation of Gigadibs. I should call him Gigadibsius\r\nOptimus Maximus.\r\n\r\n[Another time, referring to Dean Stanley's historical\r\nimpressionability, as militating against his sympathies with Colenso,\r\nhe said:--]\r\n\r\nStanley could believe in anything of which he had seen the supposed\r\nsite, but was sceptical where he had not seen. At a breakfast at\r\nMonckton Milnes's, just at the time of the Colenso row, Milnes asked me\r\nmy views on the Pentateuch, and I gave them. Stanley differed from me.\r\nThe account of Creation in Genesis he dismissed at once as\r\nunhistorical; but the call of Abraham, and the historical narrative of\r\nthe Pentateuch, he accepted. This was because he had seen\r\nPalestine--but he wasn't present at the Creation.\r\n\r\n[When he and Stanley met, there was sure to be a brisk interchange of\r\nrepartee. One of these occasions, a ballot day at the Athenaeum, has\r\nbeen recorded by the late Sir W.H. Flower:--\r\n\r\nA well-known popular preacher of the Scotch Presbyterian Church, who\r\nhad made himself famous by predictions of the speedy coming of the end\r\nof the world, was up for election. I was standing by Huxley when the\r\nDean, coming straight from the ballot boxes, turned towards us.]\r\n\"Well,\" [said Huxley], \"have you been voting for C.?\" [\"Yes, indeed I\r\nhave,\" replied the Dean.] \"Oh, I thought the priests were always\r\nopposed to the prophets,\" [said Huxley.] \"Ah!\" replied the Dean, with\r\nthat well-known twinkle in his eye, and the sweetest of smiles, \"but\r\nyou see, I do not believe in his prophecies, and some people say I am\r\nnot much of a priest.\"\r\n\r\nA few words as to his home life may perhaps be fitly introduced here.\r\nTowards his children he had the same union of underlying tenderness\r\nveiled beneath inflexible determination for what was right, which\r\nmarked his intercourse with those outside his family.\r\n\r\nAs children we were fully conscious of this side of his character. We\r\nfelt our little hypocrisies shrivel up before him; we felt a confidence\r\nin the infallible rectitude of his moral judgments which inspired a\r\nkind of awe. His arbitrament was instant and final, though rarely\r\ninvoked, and was perhaps the more tremendous in proportion to its\r\nrarity. This aspect, as if of an oracle without appeal, was heightened\r\nin our minds by the fact that we saw but little of him. This was one of\r\nthe penalties of his hard-driven existence. In the struggle to keep his\r\nhead above water for the first fifteen or twenty years of his married\r\nlife, he had scarcely any time to devote to his children. The \"lodger,\"\r\nas he used to call himself at one time, who went out early and came\r\nback late, could sometimes spare half an hour just before or after\r\ndinner to draw wonderful pictures for the little ones, and these were\r\nmemorable occasions. I remember that he used to profess a horror of\r\nbeing too closely watched, or of receiving suggestions, while he drew.\r\n\"Take care, take care,\" he would exclaim, \"or I don't know what it will\r\nturn into.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I was seven years old I had the misfortune to be laid up with\r\nscarlet fever, and then his gift of drawing was a great solace to me.\r\nThe solitary days--for I was the first victim in the family--were very\r\nlong, and I looked forward with intense interest to one half-hour after\r\ndinner, when he would come up and draw scenes from the history of a\r\nremarkable bull-terrier and his family that went to the seaside, in a\r\nmost human and child-delighting manner. I have seldom suffered a\r\ngreater disappointment than when, one evening, I fell asleep just\r\nbefore this fairy half-hour, and lost it out of my life.\r\n\r\nIn those days he often used to take the three eldest of us out for a\r\nwalk on Sunday afternoons, sometimes to the Zoological Gardens, more\r\noften to the lanes and fields between St. John's Wood and Hampstead or\r\nWest End. For then the flood of bricks and mortar ceased on the\r\nFinchley Road just beyond the Swiss Cottage, and the West End Lane,\r\nwinding solitary between its high hedges and rural ditches, was quite\r\nlike a country road in holiday time, and was sometimes gladdened in\r\nJune with real dog-roses, although the church and a few houses had\r\nalready begun to encroach on the open fields at the end of the Abbey\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nMy father often used to delight us with sea stories and tales of\r\nanimals, and occasionally with geological sketches suggested by the\r\ngravels of Hampstead Heath. But regular \"shop\" he would not talk to us,\r\ncontrary to the expectation of people who have often asked me whether\r\nwe did not receive quite a scientific training from his companionship.\r\n\r\nAt the Christmas dinner he invariably delighted the children by carving\r\nwonderful beasts, generally pigs, out of orange peel. When the marriage\r\nof his eldest daughter had taken her away from this important function,\r\nshe was sent the best specimen as a reminder.]\r\n\r\n4 Marlborough Place, December 25, 1878.\r\n\r\nDearest Jess,\r\n\r\nWe have just finished the mid-day Christmas dinner, at which function\r\nyou were badly wanted. The inflammation of the pudding was highly\r\nsuccessful--in fact Vesuvian not to say Aetnaic--and I have never yet\r\nattained so high a pitch in piggygenesis as on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe specimen I enclose, wrapped in a golden cerecloth, and with the\r\nremains of his last dinner in the proper region, will prove to you the\r\nheights to which the creative power of the true artist may soar. I call\r\nit a \"Piggurne, or a Harmony in Orange and White.\"\r\n\r\nPreserve it, my dear child, as evidence of the paternal genius, when\r\nthose light and fugitive productions which are buried in the\r\nphilosophical transactions and elsewhere are forgotten.\r\n\r\nMy best wishes to Fred and you, and may you succeed better than I do in\r\nkeeping warm.\r\n\r\nEver your loving father,\r\n\r\nT.H. Huxley.\r\n\r\n[Later on, however, the younger children who kept up the home at\r\nMarlborough Place after the elder ones had married or gone out into the\r\nworld, enjoyed more opportunities of his ever-mellowing companionship.\r\nStrongly as he upheld the conventions when these represented some valid\r\nresults of social experience, he was always ready to set aside his mere\r\nlikes and dislikes on good cause shown; to follow reason as against the\r\nmere prejudice of custom, even his own.\r\n\r\nSevere he might be on occasion, but never harsh. His idea in bringing\r\nup his children was to accustom them as early as possible to a certain\r\namount of independence, at the same time trying to make them regard him\r\nas their best friend.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of his character is specially touched upon by Sir Leslie\r\nStephen, in a letter written to my mother in July 1895:--\r\n\r\nNo one, I think, could have more cordially admired Huxley's\r\nintellectual vigour and unflinching honesty than I. It pleases me to\r\nremember that I lately said something of this to him, and that he\r\nreceived what I said most heartily and kindly. But what now dwells most\r\nin my mind is the memory of old kindness, and of the days when I used\r\nto see him with you and his children. I may safely say that I never\r\ncame from your house without thinking how good he is; what a tender and\r\naffectionate nature the man has! It did me good simply to see him. The\r\nrecollection is sweet to me now, and I rejoice to think how infinitely\r\nbetter you know what I must have been dull indeed not more or less to\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nAs he wrote to his son on his twenty-first birthday:--]\r\n\r\nYou will have a son some day yourself, I suppose, and if you do, I can\r\nwish you no greater satisfaction than to be able to say that he has\r\nreached manhood without having given you a serious anxiety, and that\r\nyou can look forward with entire confidence to his playing the man in\r\nthe battle of life. I have tried to make you feel your responsibilities\r\nand act independently as early as possible--but, once for all, remember\r\nthat I am not only your father but your nearest friend, ready to help\r\nyou in all things reasonable, and perhaps in a few unreasonable.\r\n\r\n[This domestic happiness which struck others so forcibly was one of the\r\nvital realities of his existence. Without it his quick spirit and\r\nnervous temperament could never have endured the long and often\r\nembittered struggle--not merely with equanimity, but with a constant\r\ngrowth of sympathy for earnest humanity, which, in early days obscured\r\nfrom view by the turmoil of strife, at length became apparent to all as\r\nthe tide of battle subsided. None realised more than himself what the\r\nsustaining help and comradeship of married life had wrought for him,\r\nalike in making his life worth living and in making his life's work\r\npossible. Here he found the pivot of his happiness and his strength;\r\nhere he recognised to the full the care that took upon itself all\r\npossible burdens and left his mind free for his greater work.\r\n\r\nHe had always a great tenderness for children. \"One of my earliest\r\nrecollections of him,\" writes Jeffery Parker, \"is in connection with a\r\nletter he wrote to my father, on the occasion of the death, in infancy,\r\nof one of my brothers. 'Why,' he wrote, 'did you not tell us before\r\nthat the child was named after me, that we might have made his short\r\nlife happier by a toy or two.' I never saw a man more crushed than he\r\nwas during the dangerous illness of one of his daughters, and he told\r\nme that, having then to make an after-dinner speech, he broke down for\r\nthe first time in his life, and for one painful moment forgot where he\r\nwas and what he had to say. I can truly say that I never knew a man\r\nwhose way of speaking of his family, or whose manner in his own home,\r\nwas fuller of a noble, loving, and withal playful courtesy.\"\r\n\r\nAfter he had retired to Eastbourne, his grandchildren reaped the\r\nbenefit of his greater leisure. In his age his love of children brimmed\r\nover with undiminished force, unimpeded by circumstances. He would make\r\nendless fun with them, until one little mite, on her first visit, with\r\nwhom her grandfather was trying to ingratiate himself with a vast deal\r\nof nonsense, exclaimed: \"Well, you are the curioustest old man I ever\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nAnother, somewhat older, developed a great liking for astronomy under\r\nher grandfather's tuition. One day a visitor, entering unexpectedly,\r\nwas astonished to find the pair of them kneeling on the floor in the\r\nhall before a large sheet of paper, on which the professor was drawing\r\na diagram of the solar system on a large scale, with a little pellet\r\nand a large ball to represent earth and sun, while the child was\r\nlistening with the closest attention to an account of the planets and\r\ntheir movements, which he knew so well how to make simple and precise\r\nwithout ever being dull.\r\n\r\nChildren seemed to have a natural confidence in the expression of\r\nmingled power and sympathy which, especially in his later years,\r\nirradiated his \"square, wise, swarthy face\" (\"There never was a face, I\r\ndo believe\" (wrote Sir Walter Besant of the portrait by John Collier),\r\n\"wiser, more kindly, more beautiful for wisdom and the kindliness of\r\nit, than this of Huxley.\"--The \"Queen\", November 16, 1895.), and\r\nproclaimed to all the sublimation of a broad native humanity tried by\r\nadversity and struggle in the pursuit of noble ends. It was the\r\nconfidence that an appeal would not be rejected, whether for help in\r\ndistress, or for the satisfaction of the child's natural desire for\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nSpirit and determination in children always delighted him. His grandson\r\nJulian, a curly-haired rogue, alternately cherub and pickle, was a\r\nsource of great amusement and interest to him. The boy must have been\r\nabout four years old when my father one day came in from the garden,\r\nwhere he had been diligently watering his favourite plants with a big\r\nhose, and said: \"I like that chap! I like the way he looks you straight\r\nin the face and disobeys you. I told him not to go on the wet grass\r\nagain. He just looked up boldly, straight at me, as much as to say,\r\n'What do YOU mean by ordering me about?' and deliberately walked on to\r\nthe grass.\"\r\n\r\nThe disobedient youth who so charmed his grandfather's heart was the\r\nprototype of Sandy in Mrs. Humphry Ward's \"David Grieve\". When the book\r\ncame out my father wrote to the author: \"We are very proud of Julian's\r\napotheosis. He is a most delightful imp, and the way in which he used\r\nto defy me on occasion, when he was here, was quite refreshing. The\r\nstrength of his conviction that people who interfere with his freedom\r\nare certainly foolish, probably wicked, is quite Gladstonian.\"\r\n\r\nA year after, when Julian had learned to write, and was reading the\r\nimmortal \"Water Babies\", wherein fun is poked at his grandfather's name\r\namong the authorities on water-babies and water-beasts of every\r\ndescription, he greatly desired more light as to the reality of\r\nwater-babies. There is a picture by Linley Sambourne, showing my father\r\nand Owen examining a bottled water-baby under big magnifying glasses.\r\nHere, then, was a real authority to consult. So he wrote a letter of\r\ninquiry, first anxiously asking his mother if he would receive in reply\r\na \"proper letter\" that he could read for himself, or a \"wrong kind of\r\nletter\" that must be read to him.\r\n\r\nDear Grandpater,\r\n\r\nHave you seen a Waterbaby? Did you put it in a bottle? Did it wonder if\r\nit could get out? Can I see it some day?\r\n\r\nYour loving\r\n\r\nJulian.\r\n\r\nTo this he received the following reply from his grandfather, neatly\r\nprinted, letter by letter, very unlike the orderly confusion with which\r\nhis pen usually rushed across the paper--time being so short for such a\r\nmultitude of writing--to the great perplexity, often, of his foreign\r\ncorrespondents.]\r\n\r\nHODESLEA, STAVELEY ROAD, EASTBOURNE, March 24 1892.\r\n\r\nMy dear Julian\r\n\r\nI never could make sure about that Water Baby. I have seen Babies in\r\nwater and Babies in bottles; but the Baby in the water was not in a\r\nbottle and the Baby in the bottle was not in water.\r\n\r\nMy friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby, was a very kind man\r\nand very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as\r\nhe did--There are some people who see a great deal and some who see\r\nvery little in the same things.\r\n\r\nWhen you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers and\r\nsee things more wonderful than Water Babies where other folks can see\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nGive my best love to Daddy and Mammy and Trevenen--Grand is a little\r\nbetter but not up yet--\r\n\r\nEver\r\n\r\nYour loving\r\n\r\nGrandpater.\r\n\r\n[Others of his family would occasionally receive elaborate pieces of\r\nnonsense, of which I give a couple of specimens. The following is to\r\nhis youngest daughter:--]\r\n\r\nAthenaeum Club, May 17, 1892.\r\n\r\nDearest Babs,\r\n\r\nAs I was going along Upper Thames\r\n\r\nStreet just now, I saw between Numbers 170 and 211 ( (primary\r\nparenthesis) but you would like to know what I was going along that\r\nodorous street for.

Jack will give you a\r\ncharacter, I am sure, on the side of the art of ruling, and I will\r\nspeak for the science--also of hereditary (on mother's side) instinct.\r\n\r\nWell I am not sure about the pen yet--but there is no room for any more.\r\n\r\nEver your loving\r\n\r\nDad.\r\n\r\nEpistolary composition on the model of a Gladstonian speech to a\r\ndeputation on women's suffrage.\r\n\r\n[The other is to his daughter, Mrs. Harold Roller, who had sent him\r\nfrom abroad a friend's autograph-book for a signature:--]\r\n\r\nHodeslea, Eastbourne, November 1, 1893.\r\n\r\nThe epistle of Thomas to the woman of the house of Harold.\r\n\r\n1. I said it was an autograph-book; and so it was.\r\n\r\n2. And naughty words came to the root of my tongue.\r\n\r\n3. And the recording angel dipped his pen in the ink and squared his\r\nelbows to write.\r\n\r\n4. But I spied the hand of the lovely and accomplished but vagabond\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n5. And I smole; and spoke not; nor uttered the naughty words.\r\n\r\n6. So the recording angel was sold;\r\n\r\n7. And was about to suck his pen.\r\n\r\n8. But I said Nay! give it to me.\r\n\r\n9.

Parents not too rich wish to send exceptionally clever, energetic\r\nlad to university--before taking up father's profession of architect.\r\n\r\n2. Exceptionally clever, energetic lad will be well taught classics at\r\nschool--not well taught in other things--will easily get a scholarship\r\neither at school or university. So much in parents' pockets.\r\n\r\n3. Exceptionally clever, energetic lad will get as much mathematics,\r\nmechanics, and other needful preliminaries to architecture, as he wants\r\n(and a good deal more if he likes) at Oxford. Excellent physical school\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n4. Splendid Art museums at Oxford.\r\n\r\n5. Prigs not peculiar to Oxford.\r\n\r\n6. Don Cambridge would choke science (except mathematics) if it could\r\nas willingly as Don Oxford and more so.\r\n\r\n7. Oxford always represents English opinion, in all its extremes,\r\nbetter than Cambridge.\r\n\r\n8. Cambridge better for doctors, Oxford for architects, poets,\r\npainters, and-all-that-sort-of-cattle (all crossed out).\r\n\r\n9. LAWRENCE WILL GO TO OXFORD and become a real scholar, which is a\r\ngreat thing and a noble. He will combine the new and the old, and show\r\nhow much better the world would have been if it had stuck to Hellenism.\r\nYou are dreaming of the schoolboy who does not follow up his work, or\r\nbecomes a mere poll man. Good enough for parsons, not for men. LAWRENCE\r\nWILL GO TO OXFORD.\r\n\r\nEver your aggrawatin'\r\n\r\nPa.\r\n\r\n[Like the old Greek sage and statesman, my father might have declared\r\nthat old age found him ever learning. Not indeed with the fiery\r\nearnestness of his young days of stress and storm; but with the steady\r\nadvance of a practised worker who cannot be unoccupied. History and\r\nphilosophy, especially biblical criticism, composed his chief reading\r\nin these later years.\r\n\r\nFortune had ceased her buffets; broken health was restored; and from\r\nhis resting-place among his books and his plants he watched keenly the\r\nstruggle which had now passed into other hands, still ready to strike a\r\nblow if need be, or even, on rare occasions, to return to the fighting\r\nline, as when he became a leader in the movement for London University\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nHis days at Eastbourne, then, were full of occupation, if not the\r\noccupation of former days. The day began as early; he never relaxed\r\nfrom the rule of an eight o'clock breakfast. Then a pipe and an hour\r\nand a half of letter-writing or working at an essay. Then a short\r\nexpedition around the garden, to inspect the creepers, tend the\r\nsaxifrages, or see how the more exposed shrubs could best be sheltered\r\nfrom the shrivelling winds. The gravelled terrace immediately behind\r\nthe house was called the Quarterdeck; it was the place for a brisk\r\npatrolling in uncertain weather or in a north wind. In the lower garden\r\nwas a parallel walk protected from the south by a high double hedge of\r\ncypress and golden elder, designed for shelter from the summer sun and\r\nsoutherly winds.\r\n\r\nThen would follow another spell of work till near one o'clock; the\r\nweather might tempt him out again before lunch; but afterwards he was\r\ncertain to be out for an hour or two from half-past two. However hard\r\nit blew, and Eastbourne is seldom still, the tiled walk along the\r\nsea-wall always offered the possibility of a constitutional. But the\r\nhigh expanse of the Downs was his favourite walk. The air of Beachy\r\nHead, 560 feet up, was an unfailing tonic. In the summer he used to\r\nkeep a look-out for the little flowers of the short, close turf of the\r\nchalk which could remind him of his Alpine favourites, in particular\r\nthe curious phyteuma; and later on, in the folds of the hills where he\r\nhad marked them, the English Gentians.\r\n\r\nAfter his walk, a cup of tea was followed by more reading or writing\r\ntill seven; after dinner another pipe, and then he would return to my\r\nmother in the drawing-room, and settle down in his particular armchair,\r\nwith some tough volume of history or theology to read, every now and\r\nagain scoring a passage for future reference, or jotting a brief note\r\non the margin. At ten he would migrate to the study for a final smoke\r\nbefore going to bed.\r\n\r\nSuch was his routine, broken by occasional visits to town on business,\r\nfor he was still Dean of the Royal College of Science and a trustee of\r\nthe British Museum. Old friends came occasionally to stay for a few\r\ndays, and tea-time would often bring one or two of the small circle of\r\nfriends whom he had made in Eastbourne. These also he occasionally\r\nvisited, but he scarcely ever dined out. The talking was too tiring.\r\n\r\nThe change to Eastbourne cut away a whole series of interests, but it\r\nimported a new and very strong one into my father's life. His garden\r\nwas not only a convenient ambulatory, but, with its growing flowers and\r\ntrees, became a novel and intense pleasure, until he began] \"to think\r\nwith Candide that 'Cultivons notre jardin' comprises the whole duty of\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\n[It was strange that this interest should have come suddenly at the end\r\nof his life. Though he had won the prize in Lindley's botanical class,\r\nhe had never been a field botanist till he was attracted by the Swiss\r\ngentians. As has been said before, his love of nature had never run to\r\ncollecting either plants or animals. Mere \"spider-hunters and\r\nhay-naturalists,\" as a German friend called them, he was inclined to\r\nregard as the camp-followers of science. It was the engineering side of\r\nnature, the unity of plan of animal construction, worked out in\r\ninfinitely varying detail, which engrossed him. Walking once with\r\nHooker in the Rhone valley, where the grass was alive with red and\r\ngreen grasshoppers, he said,] \"I would give anything to be as\r\ninterested in them as you are.\"\r\n\r\n[But this feeling, unknown to him before, broke out in his gentian\r\nwork. He told Hooker, \"I can't express the delight I have in them.\" It\r\ncontinued undiminished when once he settled in the new house and laid\r\nout a garden. His especial love was for the rockery of Alpines, many of\r\nwhich came from Sir J. Hooker.\r\n\r\nHere, then, he threw himself into gardening with characteristic ardour.\r\nHe described his position as a kind of mean between the science of the\r\nbotanist and the empiricism of the working gardener. He had plenty to\r\nsuggest, but his gardener, like so many of his tribe, had a rooted\r\nmistrust of any gardening lore culled from books. \"Books? They'll say\r\nanything in them books.\" And he shared, moreover, that common\r\nsuperstition, perhaps really based upon a question of labour, that\r\nwatering of flowers, unnecessary in wet weather, is actively bad in\r\ndry. So my father's chief occupation in the garden was to march about\r\nwith a long hose, watering, and watering especially his alpines in the\r\nupper garden and along the terraces lying below the house. The\r\nsaxifrages and the creepers on the house were his favourite plants.\r\nWhen he was not watering the one he would be nailing up the other, for\r\nthe winds of Eastbourne are remarkably boisterous, and shrivel up what\r\nthey do not blow down.] \"I believe I shall take to gardening,\" [he\r\nwrites, a few months after entering the new house,] \"if I live long\r\nenough. I have got so far as to take a lively interest in the condition\r\nof my shrubs, which have been awfully treated by the long cold.\"\r\n\r\n[From this time his letters contain many references to his garden. He\r\nis astonished when his gardener asks leave to exhibit at the local\r\nshow, but delighted with his pluck. Hooker jestingly sends him a plant\r\n\"which will flourish on any dry, neglected bit of wall, so I think it\r\nwill just suit you.\"]\r\n\r\nGreat improvements have been going on (he writes in 1892), and the next\r\ntime you come you shall walk in the \"avenue\" of four box-trees. Only\r\nfive are to be had for love or money at present, but there are hopes of\r\na sixth, and then the \"avenue\" will be full ten yards long! Figurez\r\nvous ca!\r\n\r\n[It was of this he wrote on October 1:--]\r\n\r\nThank Heaven we are settled down again and I can vibrate between my\r\nbeloved books and even more beloved saxifrages.\r\n\r\nThe additions to the house are great improvements every way, outside\r\nand in, and when the conservatory is finished we shall be quite\r\npalatial; but, alas, of all my box-trees only one remains green, that\r\nis the \"amari,\" or more properly \"fusci\" aliquid.\r\n\r\n[Sad things will happen, however. Although the local florists vowed\r\nthat the box-trees would not stand the winds of Eastbourne, he was set\r\non seeing if he could not get them to grow despite the gardeners, whom\r\nhe had once or twice found false prophets. But this time they were\r\nright. Vain were watering and mulching and all the arts of the\r\nhusbandman. The trees turned browner and browner every day, and the\r\nlittle avenue from terrace to terrace had to be ignominiously uprooted\r\nand removed.\r\n\r\nA sad blow this, worse even than the following:--]\r\n\r\nA lovely clematis in full flower, which I had spent hours in nailing\r\nup, has just died suddenly. I am more inconsolable than Jonah!\r\n\r\n[He answers some gardening chaff of Sir Michael Foster's:--]\r\n\r\nWait till I cut you out at the Horticultural. I have not made up my\r\nmind what to compete in yet. Look out when I do!\r\n\r\n[And when the latter offered to propose him for that Society, he\r\nreplied:--]\r\n\r\nProud an' 'appy should I be to belong to the Horticultural if you will\r\nsee to it. Could send specimens of nailing up creepers if qualification\r\nis required.\r\n\r\n[After his long battlings for his early loves of science and liberty of\r\nthought, his later love of the tranquil garden seemed in harmony with\r\nthe dignified rest from struggle. To those who thought of the past and\r\nthe present, there was something touching in the sight of the old man\r\nwhose unquenched fires now lent a gentler glow to the peaceful\r\nretirement he had at length won for himself. His latter days were\r\nfruitful and happy in their unflagging intellectual interests, set off\r\nby the new delights of the succidia altera, that second resource of\r\nhale old age for many a century.\r\n\r\nAll through his last and prolonged illness, from earliest spring until\r\nmidsummer, he loved to hear how the garden was getting on, and would\r\nask after certain flowers and plants. When the bitter cold spring was\r\nover and the warm weather came, he spent most of the day outside, and\r\neven recovered so far as to be able to walk once into the lower garden\r\nand visit his favourite flowers. These children of his old age helped\r\nto cheer him to the last.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 1.\r\n\r\nAs for this unfinished work, suggestive outlines left for others to\r\nfill in, Professor Howes writes to me in October 1899:--\r\n\r\nConcerning the papers at South Kensington, which, as part of the\r\ncontents of your father's book-shelves, were given by him to the\r\nCollege, and now are arranged, numbered, and registered in order for\r\nuse, there is evidence that in 1858 he, with his needles and eyeglass,\r\nhad dissected and carefully figured the so-called pronephros of the\r\nFrog's tadpole, in a manner which as to accuracy of detail anticipated\r\nlater discovery. Again, in the early '80's, he had observed and\r\nrecorded in a drawing the prae-pulmonary aortic arch of the Amphibian,\r\nat a period antedating the researches of Boas, which in connection with\r\nits discovery placed the whole subject of the morphology of the\r\npulmonary artery of the vertebrata on its final basis, and brought\r\nharmony into our ideas concerning it.\r\n\r\nBoth these subjects lie at the root of modern advances in vertebrate\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\nConcerning the skull, he was in the '80's back to it with a will. His\r\nline of attack was through the lampreys and hags and the higher\r\ncartilaginous fishes, and he was following up a revolutionary\r\nconception (already hinted at in his Hunterian Lectures in 1864, and\r\nlater in a Royal Society paper on Amphioxus in 1875), that the\r\ntrabeculae cranii, judged by their relationships to the nerves, may\r\nrepresent a pair of prae-oral visceral arches. In his unpublished notes\r\nthere is evidence that he was bringing to the support of this\r\nconclusion the discovery of a supposed 4th branch to the trigeminal\r\nnerve--the relationships of this (which he proposed to term the\r\n\"hyporhinal\" or palato-nasal division) and the ophthalmic (to have been\r\ntermed the \"orbitonasal\" (A term already applied by him in 1875 to the\r\ncorresponding nerve in the Batrachia. (\"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" 9th\r\nedition, volume 1 article \"Amphibia.\"))) to the trabecular arch and a\r\nsupposed prae-mandibular visceral cleft, being regarded as repetitional\r\nof those of the maxillary and mandibular divisions to the mandibular\r\ncleft. So far as I am aware, von Kupffer is the only observer who has\r\ngiven this startling conclusion support, in his famous \"Studien\" (Hf.\r\nI. Kopf Acipenser, Munchen, 1893), and from the nature of other recent\r\nwork on the genesis of parts of the cranium hitherto thought to be\r\nwholly trabecular in origin, it might well be further upheld. As for\r\nthe discovery of the nerve, I have been lately much interested to find\r\nthat Mr. E. Phelps Allis, junior, an investigator who has done grand\r\nwork in Cranial Morphology, has recently and independently arrived at a\r\nsimilar result. It was while working in my laboratory in July last that\r\nhe mentioned the fact to me. Remembering that your father had published\r\nthe aforementioned hints on the subject, and recalling conversations I\r\nhad with him, it occurred to me to look into his unpublished\r\nmanuscripts (then being sorted), if perchance he had gone further. And,\r\nbehold! there is a lengthy attempt to write the matter up in full, in\r\nwhich, among other things, he was seeking to show that, on this basis,\r\nthe mode of termination of the notochord in the Craniata, and in the\r\nBranchiostomidae (in which the trabecular arch is undifferentiated), is\r\nreadily explained. Mr. Allis's studies are now progressing, and I have\r\narranged with him that if, in the end, his results come sufficiently\r\nclose to your father's, he shall give his work due recognition and\r\npublicity. (See \"The Lateral Sensory Canals, the Eye-Muscles, and the\r\nPeripheral Distribution of certain of the Cranial Nerves of Mustelus\r\nlaevis\" by Edward Phelps Allis, junior, reprinted from \"Quarterly\r\nJournal Micr. S.\" volume 45 part 2 New Series.)\r\n\r\nAmong his schemes of the early '80's, there was actually commenced a\r\nwork on the principles of Mammalian Anatomy and an Elementary Treatise\r\non the Vertebrata. The former exists in the shape of a number of\r\ndrawings with very brief notes, the latter to a slight extent only in\r\nmanuscript. In the former, intended for the medical student and as a\r\nmeans of familiarising him with the anatomical \"tree\" as distinct from\r\nits surgical \"leaves,\" your father once again returned to the skull,\r\nand he leaves a scheme for a revised terminology of its nerve exits\r\nworthy his best and most clear-headed endeavours of the past.\r\n(Concerning this he wrote to Professor Howes in 1890 when giving him\r\npermission to denote two papers which he was about to present to the\r\nZoological Society, as the first which emanated from the Huxley\r\nResearch Laboratory]:--\"Pray do as you think best about the\r\nnomenclature. I remember when I began to work at the skull it seemed a\r\nhopeless problem, and years elapsed before I got hold of the clue.\"\r\n[And six weeks later, he writes]:--\"You are always welcome to turn\r\nanything of mine to account, though I vow I do not just now recollect\r\nanything about the terms you mention. If you were to examine me in my\r\nown papers, I believe I should be plucked.\") [And well do I remember\r\nhow, in the '80's, both in the class-room and in conversation, he would\r\nemphasise the fact that the hypoglossus nerve roots of the mammal arise\r\nserially with the ventral roots of the spinal nerves, little thinking\r\nthat the discovery by Froriep, in 1886, of their dorsal ganglionated\r\ncounterparts, would establish the actual homology between the two, and\r\nby leading to the conclusion that though actual vertebrae do not\r\ncontribute to the formation of the mammalian skull, its occipital\r\nregion is of truncal origin, mark the most revolutionary advance in\r\ncranial morphology since his own of 1856.\r\n\r\nMuch of the final zoological work of his life lay with the Bony Fishes,\r\nand he leaves unfinished (indeed only just commenced) a memoir\r\nembodying a new scheme of classification of these, which shows that he\r\nwas intending to do for them what he did for Birds in the most active\r\nperiod of his career. It was my good fortune to have helped as a hodman\r\nin the study of these creatures, with a view to a Text-book we were to\r\nhave written conjointly, and as I realise what he was intending to make\r\nout of the dry facts, I am filled with grief at the thought of what we\r\nmust have lost. His classification was based on the labours of years,\r\nas testified by a vast accumulation of rough notes and sketches, and as\r\na conspicuous feature of it there stands the embodiment under one head\r\nof all those fishes having the swim-bladder in connection with the\r\nauditory organ by means of a chain of ossicles--a revolutionary\r\narrangement, which later, in the hands of the late Dr. Sagemahl, and by\r\nhis introduction of the famous term--\"Ostariophyseae,\" has done more\r\nthan all else of recent years to clear the Ichthyological air. Your\r\nfather had anticipated this unpublished, and in a proposal to unite the\r\nHerrings and Pikes into a single group, the \"Clupesoces,\" he had\r\nfurther given promise of a new system, based on the study of the\r\nstructure of the fins, jaws, and reproductive organs of the Bony\r\nFishes, the classifications of which are still largely chaotic, which\r\nwould have been as revolutionary as it was rational. New terms both in\r\ntaxonomy and anatomy were contemplated, and in part framed. His\r\npublished terms \"Elasmo-\" and \"Cysto-arian\" are the adjective form of\r\ntwo--far-reaching and significant--which give an idea of what was to\r\nhave come. Similarly, the spinose fin-rays were to have been termed\r\n\"acanthonemes,\" the branching and multiarticulate \"arthronemes,\" and\r\nthose of the more elementary and \"adipose fin\" type \"protonemes\": and\r\nhad he lived to complete the task, I question whether it would not have\r\nexcelled his earlier achievements.\r\n\r\nThe Rabbit was to have been the subject of the first of the\r\naforementioned books, and in the desire to get at the full meaning of\r\nproblems which arose during its progress, he was led to digress into a\r\ngeneral anatomical survey of the Rodentia, and in testimony to this\r\nthere remain five or six books of rough notes bearing dates 1880 to\r\n1884, and a series of finished pencil-drawings, which, as works of art\r\nand accurate delineations of fact, are among the most finished\r\nproductions of his hand. In the same manner his contemplated work upon\r\nthe Vertebrata led him during 1879-1880 to renewed investigation of the\r\nanatomy of some of the more aberrant orders. Especially as concerning\r\nthe Marsupialia and Edentata was this the case, and to the end in view\r\nhe secured living specimens of the Vulpine Phalanger, and purchased of\r\nthe Zoological Society the Sloths and Ant-eaters which during that\r\nperiod died in their Gardens. These he carefully dissected, and he\r\nleaves among his papers a series of incomplete notes (fullest as\r\nconcerning the Phalanger and Cape Anteater [Orycteropus] ([I was\r\nprivileged to assist in the dissection of the latter animal, and well\r\ndo I remember how, when by means of a blow-pipe he had inflated the\r\nbladder, intent on determining its limit of distensibility, the organ\r\nburst, with unpleasant results, which called forth the remark] \"I think\r\nwe'll leave it at that!\")), which were never finished up.\r\n\r\nThey prove that he intended the production of special monographs on the\r\nanatomy of these peculiar mammalian forms, as he did on members of\r\nother orders which he had less fully investigated, and on the more\r\nimportant groups of fishes alluded to in the earlier part of my letter;\r\nand there seems no doubt, from the collocation of dates and study of\r\nthe order of the events, that his memorable paper \"On the Application\r\nof the Laws of Evolution to the arrangement of the Vertebrata, and more\r\nparticularly of the Mammalia,\" published in the \"Proceedings of the\r\nZoological Society\" for 1880,--the most masterly among his scientific\r\ntheses--was the direct outcome of this intention, the only expression\r\nwhich he gave to the world of the interaction of a series of\r\nrevolutionary ideas and conceptions (begotten of the labours of his\r\nclosing years as a working zoologist) which were at the period assuming\r\nshape in his mind. They have done more than all else of their period to\r\nrationalise the application of our knowledge of the Vertebrata, and\r\nhave now left their mark for all time on the history of progress, as\r\nembodied in our classificatory systems.\r\n\r\nHe was in 1882 extending his important observations upon the\r\nrespiratory apparatus from birds to reptiles, with results which show\r\nhim to have been keenly appreciative of the existence of fundamental\r\npoints of similarity between the Avian and Chelonian types--a field\r\nwhich has been more recently independently opened up by Milani.\r\n\r\nNor must it be imagined that after the publication of his ideal work on\r\nthe Crayfishes in 1880, he had forsaken the Invertebrata. On the\r\ncontrary, during the late '70's, and on till 1882, he accumulated a\r\nconsiderable number of drawings (as usual with brief notes), on the\r\nMollusca. Some are rough, others beautiful in every respect, and among\r\nthe more conspicuous outcomes of the work are some detailed\r\nobservations on the nervous system, and an attempt to formulate a new\r\nterminology of orientation of the Acephalous Molluscan body. The period\r\nembraces that of his research upon the Spirula of the \"Challenger\"\r\nexpedition, since published; and incidentally to this he also\r\naccumulated a series of valuable drawings, with explanatory notes, of\r\nCephalopod anatomy, which, as accurate records of fact, are unsurpassed.\r\n\r\nAs you are aware, he was practically the founder of the Anthropological\r\nInstitute. Here again, in the late '60's and early '70's, he was most\r\nclearly contemplating a far-reaching inquiry into the physical\r\nanthropology of all races of mankind. There remain in testimony to this\r\nsome 400 to 500 photographs (which I have had carefully arranged in\r\norder and registered), most of them of the nude figure standing erect,\r\nwith the arm extended against a scale. A desultory correspondence\r\nproves that in connection with these he was in treaty with British\r\nresidents and agents all over the world, with the Admiralty and naval\r\nofficers, and that all was being done with a fixed idea in view. He was\r\nclearly contemplating something exhaustive and definite which he never\r\nfulfilled, and the method is now the more interesting from its being\r\nessentially the same as that recently and independently adopted by\r\nMortillet.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, your father's notes reveal numerous other indications of\r\nmatters and phases of activity, of great interest in their bearings on\r\nthe history and progress of contemporary investigation, but these are\r\nof a detailed and wholly technical order.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 2.\r\n\r\nHis administrative work as an officer of the Royal Society is described\r\nin the following note by Sir Joseph Hooker:--\r\n\r\nMr. Huxley was appointed Joint-Secretary of the Royal Society, November\r\n30, 1871, in succession to Dr. Sharpey, Sir George Airy being\r\nPresident, and Professor (now Sir George) Stokes, Senior Secretary. He\r\nheld the office till November 30, 1880. The duties of the office are\r\nmanifold and heavy; they include attendance at all the meetings of the\r\nFellows, and of the councils, committees, and sub-committees of the\r\nSociety, and especially the supervision of the printing and\r\nillustrating all papers on biological subjects that are published in\r\nthe Society's Transactions and Proceedings: the latter often involving\r\na protracted correspondence with the authors. To this must be added a\r\nshare in the supervision of the staff of officers, of the library and\r\ncorrespondence, and the details of house-keeping.\r\n\r\nThe appointment was well-timed in the interest of the Society, for the\r\nexperience he had obtained as an officer in the Surveying Expedition of\r\nCaptain Stanley rendered his co-operation and advice of the greatest\r\nvalue in the efforts which the Society had recently commenced to induce\r\nthe Government, through the Admiralty especially, to undertake the\r\nphysical and biological exploration of the ocean. It was but a few\r\nmonths before his appointment that he had been placed upon a committee\r\nof the Society, through which H.M.S. \"Porcupine\" was employed for this\r\npurpose in the European seas, and negotiations had already been\r\ncommenced with the Admiralty for a voyage of circumnavigation with the\r\nsame objects, which eventuated in the \"Challenger\" Expedition.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of his appointment, the equipment of the\r\n\"Challenger\", and selection of its officers, was entrusted to the Royal\r\nSociety, and in the preparation of the instructions to the naturalists\r\nMr. Huxley had a dominating responsibility. In the same year a\r\ncorrespondence commenced with the India Office on the subject of\r\ndeep-sea dredging in the Indian Ocean (it came to nothing), and another\r\nwith the Royal Geographical Society on that of a North Polar\r\nExpedition, which resulted in the Nares Expedition (1875). In 1873,\r\nanother with the Admiralty on the advisability of appointing\r\nnaturalists to accompany two of the expeditions about to be despatched\r\nfor observing the transit of Venus across the sun's disk in Mauritius\r\nand Kerguelen, which resulted in three naturalists being appointed.\r\nArduous as was the correspondence devolving on the Biological\r\nSecretary, through the instructing and instalment of these two\r\nexpeditions, it was as nothing compared with the official,\r\ndemi-official, and private, with the Government and individuals, that\r\narose from the Government request that the Royal Society should arrange\r\nfor the publication and distribution of the enormous collections\r\nbrought home by the above-named expedition. It is not too much to say\r\nthat Mr. Huxley had a voice in every detail of these publications. The\r\nsittings of the Committee of Publication of the \"Challenger\" Expedition\r\ncollections (of which Sir J.D. Hooker was chairman, and Mr. Huxley the\r\nmost active member) were protracted from 1876 to 1895, and resulted in\r\nthe publication of fifty royal quarto volumes, with plates, maps,\r\nsections, etc., the work of seventy-six authors, every shilling of the\r\nexpenditure on which (some 50,000 pounds) was passed under the\r\nauthority of the Committee of Publication.\r\n\r\nNor was Mr. Huxley less actively interested in the domestic affairs of\r\nthe Society. In 1873 the whole establishment was translated from the\r\nbuilding subsequently occupied by the Royal Academy to that which it\r\nnow inhabits in the same quadrangle; a flitting of library stuff and\r\nappurtenances involving great responsibilities on the officers for the\r\nsatisfactory re-establishment of the whole institution. In 1874 a very\r\nimportant alteration of the bye-laws was effected, whereby that which\r\ngave to Peers the privilege of being proposed for election as Fellows,\r\nwithout previous selection by the Committee (and to which bye-laws, as\r\nmay be supposed, Mr. Huxley was especially repugnant), was replaced by\r\none restricting that privilege to Privy Councillors. In 1875 he\r\nactively supported a proposition for extending the interests taken in\r\nthe Society by holding annually a reception, to which the lady friends\r\nof the Fellows who were interested in science should be invited to\r\ninspect an exhibition of some of the more recent inventions,\r\nappliances, and discoveries in science. And in the same year another\r\nreform took place in which he was no less interested, which was the\r\nabolition of the entrance fees for ordinary Fellows, which had proved a\r\nbar to the coming forward of men of small incomes, but great eminence.\r\nThe loss of income to the Society from this was met by a subscription\r\nof no less than 10,666 pounds, raised almost entirely amongst the\r\nFellows themselves for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 a responsibility, that fell heavily on the Secretaries, was the\r\nallotment annually of a grant by the Treasury of 4000 pounds, to be\r\nexpended, under the direction of the Royal and other learned societies,\r\non the advancement of science. (It is often called a grant to the Royal\r\nSociety. This is an error. The Royal Society, as such, in no way\r\nparticipates in this grant. The Society makes grants from funds in its\r\nown possession only.) Every detail of the business of this grant is\r\nundertaken by a large committee of the Royal and other scientific\r\nsocieties, which meets in the Society's rooms, and where all the\r\nbusiness connected with the grant is conducted and the records kept.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX 3.\r\n\r\nLIST OF ESSAYS, BOOKS, AND SCIENTIFIC MEMOIRS, BY T.H.
