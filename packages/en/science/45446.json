The controlling idea in its\r\npreparation was to provide brief yet reasonably complete sketches of the\r\nlives of the great pioneer workers in electricity, the ground-breaking\r\ninvestigators who went distinctly beyond the bounds of what was known\r\nbefore their time, not merely to add a fringe of information to previous\r\nknowledge, but to make it easy for succeeding generations to reach\r\nconclusions in electrical science that would have been quite impossible\r\nuntil their revealing work was done. The lives of these men are not only\r\ninteresting as scientific history, but especially as human documents,\r\nshowing the sort of men who are likely to make great advances in science\r\nand, above all, demonstrating what the outlook of such original thinkers\r\nwas on all the great problems of the world around us.\r\n\r\nIn recent times, many people have come to accept the impression that\r\nmodern science leads to such an exclusive occupation with things\r\nmaterial, that scientists almost inevitably lose sight of the deeper\r\nsignificance of the world of mystery in which humanity finds itself\r\nplaced on this planet. The lives of these great pioneers in electricity,\r\nhowever, do not lend the slightest evidence in confirmation of any such\r\nimpression. They were all of them firm believers in the existence of\r\nProvidence, of a Creator, of man's responsibility for his acts to that\r\nCreator, and of a hereafter of reward and punishment where the sanction\r\nof responsibility shall be fulfilled. Besides, they were men\r\ncharacterized by some of the best qualities in human nature. Their\r\nfellows liked them for their unselfishness, for their readiness to help\r\nothers, for their devotedness to their work and to their duties as\r\nteachers, citizens and patriots. Almost without exception, they were as\r\nfar above the average of mankind in their personal ethics as they were\r\nin their intellectual qualities.\r\n\r\nThe lives of such men, who were inspiring forces in their day, are as\r\nilluminating as they are instructive and encouraging. Perhaps never more\r\nthan now do we need such inspiration and illumination to lift life to a\r\nhigher plane of purpose and accomplishment, than that to which it is so\r\nprone to sink when material interests attract almost exclusive\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                     Page\r\n\r\n Peregrinus and Columbus                                1\r\n\r\n Norman and Gilbert                                    29\r\n\r\n Franklin and some contemporaries                      68\r\n\r\n Galvani, discoverer of animal electricity            133\r\n\r\n Volta, the founder of electrical science             162\r\n\r\n Coulomb                                              188\r\n\r\n Hans Christian Oersted                               205\r\n\r\n André Marie Ampère                                   232\r\n\r\n Ohm, the founder of mathematical electricity         258\r\n\r\n Faraday                                              299\r\n\r\n Clerk Maxwell                                        334\r\n\r\n Lord Kelvin                                          361\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n                                                     Page\r\n\r\n The double pivoted needle of Petrus Peregrinus        19\r\n\r\n First pivoted compass, Peregrinus, 1269               17\r\n\r\n Magnetic Declination at New York                      21\r\n\r\n     \"        \"       \"  San Francisco                 21\r\n\r\n     \"        \"       in London, in 1580 and 1907      23\r\n\r\n First dip-circle, invented by Norman in 1576          29\r\n\r\n Norman's illustration of magnetic dip                 31\r\n\r\n Gilbert's orb of virtue, 1600                         32\r\n\r\n Behavior of compass-needle on a terrella or\r\n     spherical lodestone                               44\r\n\r\n Gilbert's \"versorium\" or electroscope                 69\r\n\r\n Gordon's electric chimes, 1745                        75\r\n\r\n Modern form of Leyden jar, with movable coatings      87\r\n\r\n Three coated panes in series                          89\r\n\r\n   \"   panes in parallel                               89\r\n\r\n   \"   jars in parallel                                90\r\n\r\n   \"   jars in cascade                                 90\r\n\r\n Discharge by alternate contacts                       94\r\n\r\n Tassel of long threads or light strips of paper      101\r\n\r\n Procopius Divisch (1696-1765)                        108\r\n\r\n The Divisch lightning conductor (1754)               111\r\n\r\n Set of pointed rods                                  112\r\n\r\n Galvani (portrait) opposite page                     133\r\n\r\n Volta        \"        \"      \"                       162\r\n\r\n Oersted      \"        \"      \"                       205\r\n\r\n Ampère       \"        \"      \"                       232\r\n\r\n Faraday      \"        \"      \"                       299\r\n\r\n Clerk Maxwell (portrait) opposite page               334\r\n\r\n Lord Kelvin        \"        \"      \"                 361\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKERS OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPEREGRINUS AND COLUMBUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients laid down the laws of literary form in prose as well as in\r\nverse, and bequeathed to posterity works which still serve as models of\r\nexcellence. Their poets and historians continue to be read for the sake\r\nof the narrative and beauty of the style; their philosophers for breadth\r\nand depth of thought; and their orators for judicious analysis and\r\nimpassioned eloquence.\r\n\r\nIn the exact sciences, too, the ancients were conspicuous leaders by\r\nreason of the number and magnitude of the discoveries which they made.\r\nYou have only to think of Euclid and his \"Elements,\" of Apollonius and\r\nhis Conics, of Eratosthenes and his determination of the earth's\r\ncircumference, of Archimedes and his mensuration of the sphere, and of\r\nthe inscription on Plato's Academy, _Let none ignorant of geometry enter\r\nmy door_, to realize the fondness of the Greek mind for abstract truth\r\nand its suppleness and ingenuity in mathematical investigation.\r\n\r\nBut the sciences of observation did not advance with equal pace; nor was\r\nthis to be expected, as time is an essential element in experimentation\r\nand in the collection of data, both of which are necessary for the\r\nframing of theories in explanation of natural phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe slowness of advance is well seen in the development of the twin\r\nsubjects of electricity and magnetism. As to the lodestone, with which\r\nwe are concerned at present, the attractive property was the only one\r\nknown to ancient philosophy for a period of six hundred years, from the\r\ntime of Thales to the age of the Cæsars, when Lucretius wrote on the\r\nnature of things in Latin verse.\r\n\r\nLucretius records the scant magnetic knowledge of his predecessors and\r\nthen proceeds to unfold a theory of his own to account for the phenomena\r\nof the wonder-working stone. Book VI. of \"De Natura Rerum\" contains his\r\nspeculations anent the magnet, together with certain observations which\r\nshow that the poet was not only a thinker, but somewhat of an\r\nexperimenter as well. Thus he recognizes magnetic _repulsion_ when he\r\nsays: \"It happens, too, at times that the substance of the iron recedes\r\nfrom the stone as if accustomed to start back from it, and by turns to\r\nfollow it.\"\r\n\r\nThis recognition of the repelling property of the lodestone is\r\nimmediately followed by the description of an experiment which is\r\nfrequently referred to in works on magnetic philosophy. It reads: \"Thus\r\nhave I seen raspings of iron, lying in brazen vessels, thrown into\r\nagitation and start up when the magnet was moved beneath\"; or\r\nmetrically,\r\n\r\n    And oft in brazen vessels may we mark\r\n    Ringlets of Samothrace, or fragments fine\r\n    Struck from the valid iron bounding high\r\n    When close below, the magnet points its powers.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, seen and recorded by Lucretius, is of special interest\r\nto the student of magnetic history because of the use which is made of\r\niron filings and also because it has led certain writers to credit the\r\npoet with a knowledge of what is known to-day by the various names of\r\nmagnetic figures, magnetic curves, magnetic spectrum. We do not,\r\nhowever, share this view, because we see no adequate resemblance between\r\nthe positions assumed by the bristling particles of iron in the one\r\ncase, as described by the Roman poet, and the continuous symmetrical\r\ncurves of our laboratories in the other. If Lucretius noticed such\r\ncurves in his brazen vessels, he does not say so; nor does the meagre\r\ndescription of magnetic phenomena given in Book VI. warrant us in\r\nassuming that he did.\r\n\r\nThe use of iron filings to map out the entire field of force that\r\nsurrounds a magnet was unknown to classical antiquity; it was not known\r\nto Peregrinus or Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century or even to\r\nGilbert in the sixteenth. The credit for reviving the use of filings and\r\nemploying them to show the direction of the resultant force at any point\r\nin the neighborhood of a magnet, belongs to Cabeo, an Italian Jesuit,\r\nwho described and illustrated it in his \"Philosophia Magnetica,\"\r\npublished at Ferrara in the year 1629. On page 316 of that celebrated\r\nwork will be found a figure, the first of the kind, showing the position\r\ntaken by the filings when plentifully sifted over a lodestone: thick\r\ntufts at the polar ends with curved lines in the other parts of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe Samothracian rings mentioned in the passage quoted above were light,\r\nhollow rings of iron which, for the amusement of the crowd, the jugglers\r\nof the times held suspended one from the other by the power of a\r\nlodestone.\r\n\r\nWriting of the lodestone, Lucretius says:\r\n\r\n       Its viewless, potent virtues men surprise,\r\n       Its strange effects, they view with wond'ring eyes,\r\n       When without aid of hinges, links or springs\r\n       A pendent chain we hold of steely rings.\r\n       Dropt from the stone--the stone the binding source--\r\n       Ring cleaves to ring and owns magnetic force;\r\n       Those held above, the ones below maintain;\r\n       Circle 'neath circle downward draws in vain\r\n       Whilst free in air disports the oscillating chain.\r\n\r\nThough the Roman poet was acquainted with two of the leading properties\r\nof the lodestone, viz., attraction and repulsion, there is nothing in\r\nthe lines quoted above or in any other lines of his great didactic poem\r\nto indicate that he was aware of the remarkable difference which there\r\nis between one end of a lodestone and the other. The polarity of the\r\nmagnet, as we term it, was unknown to him and remained unknown for a\r\nperiod of 1200 years.\r\n\r\nDuring that long period nothing of importance was added to the magnetic\r\nlore of the world. True, a few fables were dug out of the tomes of\r\nancient writers which gained credence and popularity, partly by reason\r\nof the fondness of the human mind for the marvelous, and partly also by\r\nreason of the reputation of the authors who stood sponsors for them.\r\n\r\nPliny (23-79 A. D.) devotes several pages of his \"Natural History\" to\r\nthe nature and geographical distribution of various kinds of lodestones,\r\none of which was said to repel iron just as the normal lodestone\r\nattracts it. Needless to say that the mineral kingdom does not hold such\r\na stone, although Pliny calls it _theamedes_ and says that it was found\r\nin Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nPliny is responsible for another myth which found favor with subsequent\r\nwriters for a long time, when he says that a certain architect intended\r\nto place a mass of magnetite in the vault of an Alexandrian temple for\r\nthe purpose of holding an iron statue of Queen Arsinoe suspended in\r\nmid-air. Of like fabulous character is the oft-repeated story about\r\nMahomet, that an iron sarcophagus containing his remains was suspended\r\nby means of the lodestone between the roof of the temple at Mecca and\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, Mahomet died at Medina and was buried there in the\r\nordinary manner, so that the story as currently told of the suspension\r\nof his coffin in the \"Holy City\" of Mecca, contains a twofold error, one\r\nof place and the other of position. By a recent (1908) imperial irade of\r\nthe Sultan of Turkey, the tomb is lit up by electric light in a manner\r\nthat is considered worthy of the \"Prophet of Islam.\"\r\n\r\nFour centuries after Pliny, Claudian, the last of the Latin poets as he\r\nis styled, wrote an idyl of fifty-seven lines on the magnet, which\r\ncontains nothing but poetic generalities. St. Ambrose (340-397) and\r\nPalladius (368-430), writing on the Brahmans of India, tell how certain\r\nmagnetic mountains were said to draw iron nails from passing ships and\r\nhow wooden pegs were substituted for nails in vessels going to\r\nTaprobane, the modern Ceylon. St. Augustine (354-430) records in his \"De\r\nCivitate Dei\" the wonder which he felt in seeing scraps of iron\r\ncontained in a silver dish follow every movement of a lodestone held\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\nWith time, the legendary literature of the magnet became abundant and in\r\nsome respects amusing. Thus we read of the \"flesh\" magnet endowed with\r\nthe extraordinary power of adhering to the skin and even of drawing the\r\nheart out of a man; the \"gold\" magnet which would attract particles of\r\nthe precious metal from an admixture of sand; the \"white\" magnet used as\r\na philter; magnetic unguents of various kinds, one of which, when\r\nsmeared over a bald head, would make the hair grow; magnetic plasters\r\nfor the relief of headache; magnetic applications to ease toothaches and\r\ndispel melancholy; magnetic nostrums to cure the dropsy, to quell\r\ndisputes and even reconcile husband and wife. No less fictitious was the\r\npernicious effect on the lodestone attributed in the early days of the\r\nmariner's compass to onions and garlic; and yet, so deeply rooted was\r\nthe belief in this figment that sailors, while steering by the compass,\r\nwere forbidden the use of these vegetables lest by their breath they\r\nmight intoxicate the \"index of the pole\" and turn it away from its true\r\npointing. More reasonable than this prohibition was the maritime\r\nlegislation of certain northern countries for the protection of the\r\nlodestone on shipboard. According to this penal code, a sailor found\r\nguilty of tampering with the lodestone used for stroking the needles,\r\nwas to have the guilty hand held to a mast of the ship by a dagger\r\nthrust through it until, by tearing the flesh away, he wrenched himself\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nIt was only at the time of the Crusades that people in Europe began to\r\nrecognize the _directive_ property of the magnet, in virtue of which a\r\nfreely suspended compass-needle takes up a definite position relatively\r\nto the north-and-south line, property which is serviceable to the\r\ntraveler on land and supremely useful to the navigator on sea.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that the compass was introduced into Europe by the\r\nreturning Crusaders, who heard of it from their Mussulman foes. These,\r\nin turn, derived their knowledge from the Chinese, who are credited with\r\nits use on sea as far back as the third century of our era.[1]\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest references to the sailing compass is that of the\r\ntrouvère Guyot de Provins,[2] who wrote, about the year 1208, a\r\nsatirical poem of three thousand lines, in which the following passage\r\noccurs:\r\n\r\n    The mariners employ an art which cannot deceive.\r\n    An ugly stone and brown,\r\n    To which iron joins itself willingly\r\n    They have; after applying a needle to it,\r\n    They lay the latter on a straw\r\n    And put it simply in the water\r\n    Where the straw makes it float.\r\n    Then the point turns direct.\r\n    To the star with such certainty\r\n    That no man will ever doubt it,\r\n    Nor will it ever go wrong.\r\n    When the sea is dark and hazy,\r\n    That one sees neither star nor moon,\r\n    Then they put a light by the needle\r\n    And have no fear of losing their way.\r\n    The point turns towards the star;\r\n    And the mariners are taught\r\n    To follow the right way.\r\n    It is an art which cannot fail.\r\n\r\nThe author was a caustic and fearless critic, who lashed with equal\r\nfreedom the clergy and laity, nobles and princes, and even the reigning\r\npontiff himself, all of whom should be for their subjects, according to\r\nthe satirist, what the pole-star is for mariners--a beacon to guide them\r\nover the stormy sea of life.\r\n\r\nGuyot traveled extensively in his early years, but later in life retired\r\nfrom a world which he despised, and ended his days in the peaceful\r\nseclusion of the Benedictine Abbey of Cluny.\r\n\r\nAn interesting reference, of a similar nature to that of the minstrel\r\nGuyot, is found in the Spanish code of laws known as Las Siete Partidas\r\nof Alfonso el Sabio, begun in 1250 and completed in 1257. It says:\r\n\r\n\"And even as mariners guide themselves in the dark night by the needle,\r\nwhich is their connecting medium between the lodestone and the star, and\r\nthus shows them where they go alike in bad seasons as in good; so those\r\nwho are to give counsel to the king ought always to guide themselves by\r\njustice, which is the connecting medium between God and the world, at\r\nall times to give their guerdon to the good and their punishment to the\r\nWicked, to each according to his deserts.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to give a few more extracts from writers of the\r\nfirst half of the thirteenth century in order to show how little was\r\nknown about the magnet and how crude were the early appliances used in\r\nnavigation when Peregrinus appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nCardinal Jacques de Vitry, who lived in the East for some years, wrote\r\nhis \"History of the Orient\" between the years 1215 and 1220, in which he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"An iron needle after touching the lodestone, turns towards the north\r\nstar, so that such a needle is necessary for those who navigate the\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage of the celebrated Cardinal seems to indicate that even then\r\nthe compass was widely known and commonly used in navigation.\r\n\r\nNeckam (1157-1217), the Augustinian Abbot of Cirencester, wrote in his\r\n\"Utensilibus\":\r\n\r\n\"Among the stores of a ship, there must be a needle _mounted on a dart_\r\nwhich will oscillate and turn until the point looks to the north; the\r\nsailors will thus know how to direct their course when the pole-star is\r\nconcealed through the troubled state of the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage is of historical value, as it contains what is probably the\r\nearliest known reference to a mounted or pivoted compass. Prior to the\r\nintroduction of this mode of suspension, the needle was floated on a\r\nstraw, in a reed, on a piece of cork or a strip of wood, all of which\r\nmodes of flotation, when taken in conjunction with the unsteadiness of\r\nthe vessel in troubled waters, must have made observation difficult and\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nBrunetto Latini (1230-1294) makes a passing reference to the new\r\nmagnetic knowledge in his \"Livres dou Tresor,\" which he wrote in 1260,\r\nduring his exile in Paris.\r\n\r\n\"The sailors navigate the seas,\" he says, \"guided by the two stars\r\ncalled tramontanes; and each of the two parts of the lodestone directs\r\nthe end of the needle that has touched it to the particular star to\r\nwhich that part of the stone itself turns.\"\r\n\r\nThough a statesman, orator and philosopher of ability, the preceptor of\r\nDante in Florence and guest of Friar Bacon in Oxford, Brunetto has not\r\ngot the philosophy of the needle quite right in this passage; for the\r\npart that has been touched by the north end of a lodestone will acquire\r\nsouth polarity and will not, therefore, turn towards the same\r\n\"tramontane\" as the end of the stone by which it was touched.\r\n\r\nDante himself admitted the occult influence on the compass-needle that\r\nemanates from the pole-star when he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"Out of the heart of one of the new lights\r\n    There came a voice that, needle to the star,\r\n    Made me appear in turning thitherward.\r\n                            _Paradise_, XII., 28-30.\r\n\r\nThe next writer on the compass is Raymond Lully (1236-1315), who was\r\nnoted for his versatility, voluminous writings and extensive travels as\r\nwell as for the zeal which he displayed in converting the African\r\nMoors. Lully writes in his \"De Contemplatione\": \"As the needle after\r\ntouching the lodestone, turns to the north, so the mariners' needle\r\ndirects them over the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the last of our ante-Peregrinian writers who make\r\ndefinite allusions to the use of the compass for navigation purposes,\r\nviz., Roger Bacon, one of the glories of the thirteenth century as he\r\nwould be of the twentieth. It was at the request of his patron, Pope\r\nClement IV., that Bacon wrote his \"Opus Majus,\" a work in which he\r\ntreats of all the sciences and in which he advocates the experimental\r\nmethod as the right one for the study of natural phenomena and the only\r\none that will serve to extend the boundaries of human knowledge. In a\r\nsection on the magnet, a clear distinction is drawn between the physical\r\nproperties of the two ends of a lodestone; for \"iron which has been\r\ntouched by a lodestone,\" he says, \"follows the end by which it has been\r\ntouched and turns away from the other.\" Besides being a recognition of\r\nmagnetic polarity, this is equivalent to saying that unlike poles\r\nattract while like poles repel each other. Bacon further remarks, by way\r\nof corroboration, that if a strip of iron be floated in a basin, the end\r\nthat was touched by the lodestone will follow the stone, while the other\r\nend will flee from it as a lamb from the wolf. There is, however, an\r\nearlier recognition known of the polarity of the lodestone; for Abbot\r\nNeckam, fifty years before, called attention to the dual nature of the\r\nphysical action of the lodestone, attracting in one part (say) by\r\nsympathy and repelling at the other by antipathy. It was the common\r\nbelief in Bacon's time and for centuries after, that the compass-needle\r\nwas directed by the pole-star, often called the sailor's star; but Bacon\r\nhimself did not think so, preferring to believe with Peregrinus, that it\r\nwas controlled not by any one star or by any one constellation, but by\r\nthe entire celestial sphere. Other contemporaries of his sought the\r\ncause of the directive property not in the heavens at all, but in the\r\nearth itself, attributing it to hypothetical mines of iron which,\r\nnaturally enough, they located in regions situated near the pole.\r\nPeregrinus records this opinion, which he criticises and rejects, saying\r\nin Chapter X. that persons who hold such a doctrine \"are ignorant of the\r\nfact that in many different parts of the globe the lodestone is found;\r\nfrom which it would follow that the needle should turn in different\r\ndirections, according to the locality, which is contrary to experience.\"\r\nA little further on he gives his own view, saying: \"It is evident from\r\nthe foregoing chapters that we must conclude that not only from the\r\nnorth pole (of the world), but also from the south pole rather than from\r\nthe veins of mines, virtue flows into the poles of the lodestone.\"\r\n\r\nObservations had to accumulate and much experimentation had to be done\r\nbefore it was finally established that the cause of the directive\r\nproperty of the magnet is not to be sought in the remote star depths at\r\nall, but in the earth itself, the whole terrestrial globe acting as a\r\ncolossal magnet, partly in virtue of magnetic ore lying near the surface\r\nand partly also in virtue of electrical currents, due to solar heat,\r\ncirculating in the crust of the earth.\r\n\r\nOf the early years of Pierre le Pélérin (Petrus Peregrinus), nothing is\r\nknown save that he was born of wealthy parents in Maricourt, a village\r\nof Picardy in Northern France. From his academic title of Magister, we\r\ninfer that he received the best instruction available at the time,\r\nprobably in the University of Paris, which was then in the height of its\r\nfame. His reputation for mathematical learning and mechanical skill\r\ncrossed the Channel and reached Friar Bacon in the University of Oxford.\r\nIn his \"Opus Tertium,\" the Franciscan Friar records the esteem in which\r\nhe held his Picard friend, saying: \"I know of only one person who\r\ndeserves praise for his work in experimental philosophy, because he does\r\nnot care for the discourses of men or their wordy warfare, but quietly\r\nand diligently pursues the works of wisdom. Therefore it is that what\r\nothers grope after blindly, as bats in the evening twilight, this man\r\ncontemplates in all their brilliancy because he is master of\r\nexperiment.\"\r\n\r\nContinuing the appraisal of his Gallic friend's achievements, he says:\r\n\"He knows all natural sciences, whether pertaining to medicine and\r\nalchemy or to matters celestial and terrestrial. He has worked\r\ndiligently in the smelting of ores and also in the working of minerals;\r\nhe is thoroughly acquainted with all sorts of arms and implements used\r\nin military service and in hunting, besides which he is skilled in\r\nagriculture and also in the measurement of lands. It is impossible to\r\nwrite a useful or correct treatise on experimental philosophy without\r\nmentioning this man's name. Moreover, he pursues knowledge for its own\r\nsake; for if he wished to obtain royal favor, he could easily find\r\nsovereigns to honor and enrich him.\"\r\n\r\nThis is at once a beautiful tribute to the work and character of\r\nPeregrinus and an emphatic recognition of the paramount importance of\r\nlaboratory methods for the advancement of learning. It is evident from\r\nsuch testimony, coming as it does from an eminent member of the\r\nbrotherhood of science, that the world had not to wait for the advent of\r\nChancellor Bacon or for the publication of his _Novum Organum_ in 1620,\r\nto learn how to undertake and carry out a scientific research to a\r\nreliable issue. Call the method what you will, inductive, deductive or\r\nboth, the method advocated by the Franciscan friar of the thirteenth\r\ncentury was the one followed at all times from Archimedes to Peregrinus\r\nand from Peregrinus to Gilbert, none of whom knew anything of Lord\r\nBacon's pompous phrases and lofty commendation of the inductive method\r\nof inquiry for the advancement of physical knowledge. Be it said in\r\npassing, that Bacon, eminent as he undoubtedly was in the realm of the\r\nhigher philosophy, was, nevertheless, neither a mathematician nor a man\r\nof science; he never put to a practical test the rules which he laid\r\ndown with such certitude and expectancy for the guidance of physical\r\ninquiry. Moreover, there is not a single discovery in science made\r\nduring the three centuries that have elapsed since the promulgation of\r\nthe Baconian doctrine that can be ascribed to it; it has been steadily\r\nignored by men renowned in the world for their scientific achievements\r\nand has been absolutely barren of results.\r\n\r\nPeregrinus, on the other hand, does not stop to enumerate opinions, he\r\ndoes not even quote Aristotle; but he experiments, observes, reasons and\r\ndraws conclusions which he puts to the further test of experiment before\r\nfinally accepting them. Then and then only does he rise from the order\r\nof the physicist to that of the philosopher, from correlating facts and\r\nphenomena to the discovery of the laws which govern them and the causes\r\nthat produce them. Furthermore, he was in no hurry to let the world know\r\nthat he was grinding lodestones one day and pivoting compass-needles the\r\nnext; what he cared for supremely was to discover facts, new phenomena,\r\nnew methods. Peregrinus was not an essayist, nor was he a man of mere\r\nbook-learning. He was a clear-headed thinker, a close and resourceful\r\nworker, a man who preferred facts to phrases and observation to\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nAt one period of his life, Master Peter applied his ingenuity to the\r\nsolution of a problem in practical optics, involving the construction of\r\na burning-mirror of large dimensions somewhat after the manner of\r\nArchimedes; but though he spent three years on the enterprise and a\r\ncorrespondingly large sum of money, we are not told by Friar Bacon, who\r\nmentions the fact, what measure of success was achieved. Bacon, however,\r\navails himself of the occasion to insinuate a possible cause of failure,\r\nfor he says that nothing is difficult of accomplishment to his friend\r\n_unless it be for want of means_.\r\n\r\nCenturies later, the French naturalist Buffon took up the same optical\r\nproblem, with a view to showing that the feat attributed to Archimedes\r\nduring the siege of Syracuse by the Romans was not impossible of\r\naccomplishment. For this purpose, he used 168 small mirrors in the\r\nconstruction of a large concave reflector, with which he ignited wood at\r\na distance of 150 feet and succeeded in melting lead at a distance of\r\n140 feet. As this was done in the winter time in Paris, it was concluded\r\nthat it would have been quite possible to set a Roman trireme on fire\r\nfrom a safe distance by the concentrated energy of a Sicilian sun.\r\n\r\nIf Peregrinus was alert in mind, he appears to have been very active in\r\nbody. Prompted, no doubt, by the higher motives of Christian faith and\r\nperhaps a little, too, by his fondness for travel and adventure, he took\r\nthe cross in early life and joined one of the crusading expeditions of\r\nthe time. That he went to the land of the paynim, we have no direct\r\nevidence; but we infer the fact from the title of Peregrinus or Pilgrim,\r\nby which he is known, his full name being Pierre le Pélérin de\r\nMaricourt, or, in the Latinized form, Petrus Peregrinus de Maricourt.\r\n\r\nIn 1269, we find him engaged in a military expedition undertaken by\r\nCharles Duke of Anjou, for the purpose of bringing back to his\r\nallegiance as King of the Two Sicilies the revolted city of Lucera in\r\nSouthern Italy. He served in what might be called the engineering corps\r\nof the army, and was engaged in fortifying the camp and constructing\r\nengines of defense and attack. Unlike his companions in arms, Peregrinus\r\ndoes not allow himself to be wholly absorbed with military duties, nor\r\ndoes he waste his leisure hours in frivolous amusements; his mind is on\r\nhigher things; he is engrossed with a problem in practical mechanics\r\nwhich required him to devise a piece of mechanism that would keep an\r\narmillary sphere in motion for a time.\r\n\r\nIn outlining the necessary mechanism, as he conceived it, he was\r\ngradually led to consider the general and more fascinating problem of\r\nperpetual motion itself, with the result that he waxed somewhat\r\nenthusiastic when he thought that he saw the possibility of constructing\r\nan ever-turning wheel in which the motive power would be magnetic\r\nattraction, the attraction of a lodestone for a number of iron teeth\r\narranged at equal distances on the periphery of a wheel. The device\r\nlooked well on paper, beyond which stage it was not carried, perhaps for\r\nwant of leisure, or more probably for want of the necessary material and\r\ntools. Had Peregrinus been able to test his theoretical views on the\r\n_magnetic motor_ by actual experiment, the delusive character of\r\nperpetual motion would have been recognized at an early epoch in the\r\nworld's history, and much time and money spared for more profitable\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nThis very wheel, which was designed in the trenches before Lucera in\r\n1269, was probably the cause of the withering rebuke which Justin Huntly\r\nMcCarthy administers in his \"History of the French Revolution,\" Vol. I.,\r\np. 256, where he says: \"In the long record of rascaldom from\r\n_Peregrinus_ to Bamfylde Moore Carew, no single rascal stands forward\r\nwith such magnificent effrontery, such majestic impudence, such\r\nastonishing success as Cagliostro.\" To say the least, this is a very\r\nserious slip of the pen on the part of the Irish historian of the French\r\nRevolution, in which a scientific pioneer of the first rank and a\r\npatriot of exalted type is mistaken for a charlatan of the deepest dye.\r\n\r\nAlthough Peregrinus puts the burden of constructing his wheel on others,\r\nhe does not appear to have considered it a vain conceit; for, in the\r\nbeginning of the last chapter of the \"Epistola\" he says: \"In this\r\nchapter, I will make known to you the construction of a wheel which, in\r\na remarkable manner, moves continuously.\" He is writing from Southern\r\nItaly to his friend Siger (Syger, Sygerus), at home in Picardy; and that\r\nthis friend may the better comprehend the mechanism of the wheel, he\r\nproceeds to describe in a systematic manner the various properties of\r\nthe lodestone, all of which he had investigated and many of which he had\r\ndiscovered. The \"Epistola\" of Peregrinus is, therefore, the first\r\ntreatise on the magnet ever written; it stands as the first great\r\nlandmark in magnetic philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe work is divided into two parts--the first contains ten chapters and\r\nthe latter three. \"At your request,\" he says to his friend, \"I will\r\nmake known to you in an unpolished narrative the undoubted though hidden\r\nvirtue of the lodestone, concerning which philosophers, up to the\r\npresent time, give us no information. Out of affection for you, I will\r\nwrite in simple style about things entirely unknown to the ordinary\r\nindividual.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1 The double pivoted needle of Petrus Peregrinus, A.\r\n  D., 1269]\r\n\r\nAfter this declaration as to the original character of his work\r\nPeregrinus proceeds: \"You must know that whoever wishes to experiment\r\nshould be acquainted with the nature of things; he must also be skilled\r\nin manipulation, in order that by means of this stone, he may produce\r\nthose marvelous results.\"\r\n\r\nThe titles of the chapters will give an idea of the comprehensive\r\ncharacter of the magnetic work accomplished by the author and, at the\r\nsame time, will serve to show how much was known about the lodestone in\r\nthe thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nChap.

Construction of a better instrument for the same purpose.\r\n    III. The art of making a wheel of perpetual motion.\r\n\r\nAn attentive reading of the thirteen chapters of this treatise of 3,500\r\nwords will show that:\r\n\r\n(1) Peregrinus assigns a definite position to what he calls the _poles_\r\nof a lodestone and gives practical directions for determining which is\r\nnorth and which south.\r\n\r\n(2) He establishes the two fundamental laws of magnetism, that like\r\npoles repel and unlike poles attract each other.\r\n\r\n(3) He demonstrates by experiment that every fragment of a lodestone is\r\na complete magnet, and shows how the fragments should be put together in\r\norder to reproduce the polarity of the unbroken stone.\r\n\r\n(4) He shows how a pole of a lodestone may neutralize a weaker one of\r\nthe same name and even reverse its polarity.\r\n\r\n(5) He pivots a magnetized needle and surrounds it with a circle divided\r\ninto 360 degrees.\r\n\r\nThis brief summary shows the great advance made by the author on what\r\nwas known about the lodestone before his time. Most of the salient facts\r\nin magnetism are clearly described and some of their applications\r\npointed out. So thorough and complete was this apprehension and\r\nexplanation of magnetic phenomena that nothing of importance was added\r\nto it for the next three hundred years.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2 First pivoted compass, Peregrinus, 1269]\r\n\r\nIn the compass which Peregrinus devised for use in navigation, a light\r\nmagnetic needle was thrust through a slender vertical axis made of wood,\r\nwhich axis also carried a pointer of brass or silver at right angles to\r\nthe needle. According to the belief of the time, the magnetic needle\r\ngave the north and south points of the horizon, while the brass pointer\r\ndetermined the east and west points. This compass, double pivoted be it\r\nnoticed, was provided with a graduated circle and a movable arm, having\r\na pair of upright pins at its extremities, which movable arm enabled the\r\nnavigator to determine the magnetic bearing of the sun, moon or any star\r\nat the time of rising or setting. \"By means of this instrument,\" the\r\nauthor says in Chap. II., \"you can direct your course towards cities and\r\nislands and any other place wherever you may wish to go, by land or by\r\nsea, provided you know the latitude and longitude of the place which you\r\nwant to reach.\"\r\n\r\nThe invention of the compass has been attributed to one Flavio Gioja, a\r\nseafaring man of Amalfi, a flourishing maritime town in Southern Italy.\r\nIf we admit that Gioja was a real and not a fictitious person, we\r\ncannot, however, admit the claim which is made by his countrymen, when\r\nthey say that he gave to the mariner the use of the compass in the year\r\n1302; for we have seen that Peregrinus distinctly states that his\r\ncompass, described in 1269, could be relied upon for guidance by the\r\ntraveler on land as well as by the voyager on sea.\r\n\r\nTo Gioja may belong the merit of having simplified and improved the\r\ncompass. It is likely that he suspended the needle on one pivot instead\r\nof the two used by Peregrinus, and that he added the compass-card with\r\nits thirty-two divisions, attaching it to the needle itself, thereby\r\nadding materially to the practical character of the compass as a\r\nnautical instrument.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a claim has been made for Peregrinus which cannot be\r\nadmitted. It was put forward by his itinerant countryman Thévenot, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, to the effect that the author of the \"Epistola\"\r\nwas acquainted with magnetic declination, in virtue of which a freely\r\nsuspended magnet does not point north and south, but cuts the\r\ngeographical meridian at a definite angle.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1681, Thévenot says in his \"Recueil de Voyages\" that: \"It was\r\na matter of general belief down to the present day, that the declination\r\nof the magnetic needle was first observed sometime in the beginning of\r\nthe last (16th) century. I have found, however, that there was a\r\ndeclination of five degrees in the year 1269, having found it recorded\r\nin a manuscript with the title \"Epistola Petri Adsigerii,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe title of the manuscript seen by Thévenot is not, however, as he\r\ngives it above, but \"Epistola Petri ad Sygerium,\" etc., which is quite a\r\ndifferent reading.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-eight manuscript copies of the \"Epistola\" known to\r\nexist; and only one of them, that of the University of Leyden, contains\r\nthe passage alluded to by Thévenot. This manuscript was the object of\r\ncareful study and critical examination by Wenckebach (1865) and other\r\ncompetent scholars, who pronounced it a spurious addition made some time\r\nin the early part of the 16th century.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the time of Peregrinus, it is probable that the declination did not\r\nexceed three degrees in Paris or on the shores of the Mediterranean, a\r\nquantity so small that it would have been difficult of detection; and,\r\nif detected, would have been attributed either to errors in the\r\nconstruction of the instrument used or to inaccuracy on the part of the\r\nobserver. This is what happened to Columbus when, on his return to\r\nSpain, having reported the many and definite observations on the\r\nvariation of the compass which he had made on his outward voyage, he was\r\ntold by the learned ones of the day that _he_ was in error and not the\r\nneedle, because the latter was everywhere true to the pole.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nThis oft-stated and widely-believed fidelity of the needle to the pole\r\nis not, however, founded on fact; it is the exception, the rare\r\nexception, not the rule, despite the couplet of the poet:\r\n\r\n    Th' obedient steel with living instinct moves\r\n    And veers for ever to the pole it loves;\r\n\r\nor this other,\r\n\r\n    So turns the faithful needle to the pole,\r\n    Though mountains rise between and oceans roll.\r\n\r\nThat the magnet does not turn to the pole of the world is common\r\nknowledge to-day, when the High School tyro will tell you that in New\r\nYork it points 9° _west_ of north, while in San Francisco it points 15°\r\n_east_ of north. If he happens to be well up, he may refer to the\r\nposition of the agonic line on the globe along which the needle stands\r\ntrue to the pole, while all places to the east of that line in our\r\nhemisphere have westerly declination and those to the west have easterly\r\ndeclination. Indeed, magnetic charts show places where the needle points\r\neast and west instead of north and south, and others where the\r\nnorth-seeking end points directly south. Such varying and conflicting\r\nbehavior of the compass-needle serves to show the irregular manner in\r\nwhich the earth's magnetism is distributed and also the intensity of\r\ndistributing forces which exist at certain places.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the gems in the crown of Columbus, that he observed,\r\nmeasured and recorded this strange behavior of the magnetic needle in\r\nhis narrative of the voyage. True, he did not notice it until he was far\r\nout on the trackless ocean. A week had elapsed since he left the lordly\r\nTeneriffe, and a few days since the mountainous outline of Gomera had\r\ndisappeared from sight. The memorable night was that of September 13th,\r\n1492. There was no mistaking it; the needle of the _Santa Maria_ pointed\r\na little west of north instead of due north. Some days later, on\r\nSeptember 17th, the pilots, having taken the sun's amplitude, reported\r\nthat the variation had reached a whole point of the compass, the\r\nalarming amount of 11 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe surprise and anxiety which Columbus manifested on those occasions\r\nmay be taken as indications that the phenomenon was new to him. As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, his needles were not true even at the outset\r\nof the voyage from the port of Palos, where, though no one was aware of\r\nit, they pointed about 3° _east_ of north. This angle diminished from\r\nday to day as the Admiral kept the prow of his caravel directed to the\r\nwest, until it vanished altogether, after which the needles veered to\r\nthe _west_, and kept moving westward for a time as the flag-ship\r\nproceeded on her voyage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4 Magnetic Declination in London in 1580 and in\r\n  1907]\r\n\r\nColumbus thus determined a place on the Atlantic in which the magnetic\r\nmeridian coincided with the geographical and in which the needle stood\r\ntrue to the pole. Six years later, in 1498, Sebastian Cabot found\r\nanother place on the same ocean, a little further north, in which the\r\ncompass lay exactly in the north-and-south line. These two observations,\r\none by Columbus and the other by Cabot, sufficed to determine the\r\nposition of the _agonic line_, or line of no variation, for that\r\nlocality and epoch.\r\n\r\nThe _Columbian_ line acquired at once considerable importance, in the\r\ngeographical and the political world, because of the proposal that was\r\nmade to discard the Island of Ferro and take it for the prime meridian\r\nfrom which longitude would be reckoned east and west, and also because\r\nit was selected by Pope Alexander VI. to serve as a line of reference in\r\nsettling the rival claims of the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile with\r\nregard to their respective discoveries. It was decided that all recently\r\ndiscovered lands lying to the east of that line should belong to\r\nPortugal; and those to the west, to Castile.\r\n\r\nThe line of no variation, like all other isomagnetic lines, has shifted\r\nits position with time, so that it runs to-day considerably to the west\r\nof the place assigned to it by Columbus in 1492 and by the Papal Bull of\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nColumbus did not speak of the disquieting observation which he made on\r\nthe night of the 13th of September; he thought of it, and wondered\r\ngreatly what might be the cause of such an unexpected and untoward\r\nphenomenon. His silence on the matter did not avail, for the keen-eyed\r\nsailors noticed the westerly deflection of the needle when, after a few\r\ndays, it became quite apparent. They grew alarmed, believing that the\r\nlaws of nature were changing as they advanced farther and farther into\r\nthe unknown. It was a trying moment for the Admiral, but his ingenuity\r\nand tactfulness rose to the occasion. He told his seamen that the needle\r\ndid not point to the _cynosure_ or last star in the tail of the Little\r\nBear, as commonly supposed, but to a fixed point in the celestial sphere\r\nat which there was no star, adding that the \"cynosure\" itself, the\r\nPolaris of our days, was not stationary, but had a rotational movement\r\nof its own like all other heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what Columbus thought of his explanation, born of the\r\nstress of the moment, but the esteem in which he was held by pilots and\r\nsailors alike for his knowledge of astronomy and cosmography led them to\r\naccept it. Their fears were allayed, a mutiny was averted and a\r\nsuccessful termination to their voyage rendered possible.\r\n\r\nCaptains of ocean-liners would give to-day a different answer to a\r\npassenger who might consult them about the splinter of steel which\r\nserves to guide their fleet vessels in darkest nights, through howling\r\ntempests and over billowy seas. The mysterious influence that controls\r\nit, they would say, comes neither from Polaris nor the pole of the\r\nworld, nor from the heavens above, but from the earth beneath.\r\n\r\nSuch an explanation was not thought of until it was clearly shown a\r\nhundred years later that this globe of ours acts like a colossal\r\nlodestone, controlling every magnet in our laboratories and\r\nobservatories, and every needle on board the merchantmen and\r\nfighting-monsters that plough our seas and oceans.\r\n\r\nWithout any intuition of modern theory, Columbus made two discoveries in\r\nterrestrial magnetism, as we have seen, each of fundamental importance,\r\nwhether considered from the view-point of pure science or that of\r\npractical navigation, viz., (a) that the needle is not true to the pole\r\nand (b) that the angular displacement of the needle from true\r\norientation, the _variation of the compass_, as it is called in nautical\r\nparlance, differs with the place of the observer. These two discoveries\r\nas well as the location of a place of no variation on the Atlantic Ocean\r\nentitle Columbus to a prominent place among the founders of the\r\n_science_ of terrestrial magnetism.\r\n\r\nLater observers discovered that even for a given place this element of\r\nmagnetic declination has not a constant value, but undergoes changes\r\nwhich complete their cycle, some in a day, others in a year, and others\r\nagain in centuries. The last or _secular_ change in the direction of the\r\nmagnetic needle was discovered by Gellibrand, of London, in 1634\r\n(published in 1635); the _annual_, by Cassini, at Paris, 1782-1791; and\r\nthe _diurnal_, by Graham, of London, in 1722.\r\n\r\nThe first observation of magnetic declination on _land_ appears to have\r\nbeen made about the year 1510 by George Hartmann (1489-1564), Vicar of\r\nthe Church of St. Sebald in Nuremberg, who found it to be 6° east in\r\nRome, where he was living at the time. Hartmann's observation of the\r\ndeclination in Rome and also in Nuremberg, where the needle pointed 10°\r\neast of north, will be found in a letter which he wrote in 1544 to Duke\r\nAlbert of Prussia and which remained unpublished until the year 1831.\r\n\r\nReturning to the treatise of Peregrinus on the magnet, it should be said\r\nthat for several centuries the twenty-eight manuscript copies lay\r\nundisturbed on the dusty shelves of city and university libraries. In\r\n1562, four years after the appearance of the first printed edition\r\n(Augsburg, 1558), Taisnier, a Belgian writer on magnetics, who is also\r\ndescribed as poet-laureate and Doctor \"utriusque juris,\" was among the\r\nearliest to discover the \"Epistola,\" from which he copied extensively in\r\nhis little quarto on the magnet and its effects, thus showing that there\r\nwere literary pirates in those days. It was also well known to Gilbert,\r\nto Cabeo and Kircher; but despite the references of these writers, the\r\n\"Epistola\" remained practically unknown until Cavallo, of London, called\r\nattention to the Leyden manuscript in the third edition of his \"Treatise\r\non Magnetism,\"[3] 1800, by giving part of the text and accompanying it\r\nwith a translation.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1838, Libri, historian of the mathematical sciences in Italy,\r\ngave excerpts from the Paris codex with translation; but the scholar who\r\ncontributed most of all to make the work of Peregrinus known is the\r\nItalian Barnabite, Timoteo Bertelli, who published in 1868 a critical\r\nstudy of the various manuscripts of the letter, principally those which\r\nhe found in Rome and in Florence, adding copious notes of historic,\r\nbibliographic and scientific value. Father Bertelli was Professor of\r\nPhysics in the Collegio della Quercia, in Florence, where he took an\r\nactive interest in Italian seismology besides carrying on investigations\r\nin meteorology, telegraphy and electricity. Born in Bologna in 1826, he\r\ndied in Florence in March, 1905.\r\n\r\nThe following list of manuscript copies of the \"Epistola\" is taken from\r\na scholarly paper by Professor Silvanus P. Thompson, of London, which\r\nappeared in the \"Proceedings of the British Academy\" for 1906:--\r\n\r\n     The Bodleian Library               seven\r\n     Vatican                             four\r\n     British Museum                       one\r\n     Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris        two\r\n     Biblioteca Riccardiana, Florence     one\r\n     Trinity College, Dublin              one\r\n     Gonville and Caius, Cambridge        one\r\n     The University of Leyden             one\r\n     Geneva                               one\r\n     Turin                                one\r\n     Erfurt                             three\r\n     Vienna                             three\r\n     S.

Thompson, of\r\nLondon, published his \"Epistle of Peter Peregrinus of Maricourt to\r\nSygerus of Foncaucourt, soldier, concerning the Magnet.\" Unfortunately,\r\nthis translation was printed for private circulation and limited to 250\r\ncopies. Two years later, 1904, Brother Arnold, F. S. C., presented a\r\nmemoir on Peregrinus, including a translation of the \"Epistola,\" for the\r\nM. Sc. degree of Manhattan College, New York City, which translation was\r\npublished some months later by the McGraw Publishing Company, New York.\r\nThese are the only complete translations of the \"Letter\" of Peregrinus\r\non the Magnet which have yet appeared.\r\n\r\nBROTHER POTAMIAN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Klaproth, \"Lettre à M. le Baron A. de Humbolt sur\r\nl'Invention de la Boussole.\" 1834; also Encyc.

Norman possessed many of the fine qualities of mind, hand and\r\ndisposition that are indispensable in the make-up of the original\r\ninvestigator. In pivoting his compass-needles, he soon noticed that,\r\nhowever carefully they were balanced before being magnetized, they did\r\nnot remain horizontal after magnetization, the north-seeking end always\r\ngoing down through a small angle. He next had the happy idea of swinging\r\na needle on a horizontal axis, so that it might be free to move up and\r\ndown in a vertical plane, with the result that the north-seeking end\r\nagain went down through a constant but much greater angle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5 The first dip-circle, invented by Norman in 1576]\r\n\r\nLike declination, the first discovered of the three magnetic elements,\r\nthe dip was found to vary with place on the earth's surface, being 0° at\r\nthe magnetic equator and 90° at either pole. It was with a Norman\r\ndip-circle, greatly improved, that Ross in 1831 found the north magnetic\r\npole of the earth to be in Boothia Felix in latitude 70° 5'.3 N., and\r\nlongitude 96° 45'.8 W.; and it was with a similar instrument that\r\nAmundsen recently studied the magnetic conditions of that Arctic region,\r\nthe exact location of the pole itself being finally determined by an\r\nearth-inductor or spinning coil of the latest make. Though the results\r\nof his observations have not yet been made public, it is generally known\r\nthat they indicate a spot for the magnetic pole close to that found by\r\nSir James Ross. It is not expected, however, that the location of the\r\npole by the Norwegian Commander shall exactly coincide with that of the\r\nEnglish Captain, because the magnetic pole is believed to have nomadic\r\ntendencies of its own like our geographical pole, only much more\r\npronounced in magnitude. After moving westward for some time at the rate\r\nof a mile per year, it retraced its steps and is now back again in the\r\nvicinity of its starting place.\r\n\r\nBesides his dip-circle, Norman also devised a simple and very apt\r\nillustration of magnetic inclination. Thrusting a steel needle through a\r\nround piece of cork, he pared the latter down until the system,\r\nconsisting of the needle and the cork, sank to a certain depth in a\r\nglass vessel containing water, and there took up a horizontal position.\r\nThe needle was next removed from the water and magnetized with great\r\ncare, so as not to disturb its position in the cork. When placed again\r\nin the water, the needle sank to its former depth and settled down at an\r\nangle of 71° to the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe same illustration shows another experiment which Norman made in\r\norder to determine whether the earth exerts a force of translation on a\r\nmagnet, in virtue of which the magnet would tend to move bodily toward\r\nthe pole. For this purpose, he floated a magnetized piece of steel wire\r\non the surface of the water and noticed that, wherever placed, it merely\r\nswung round into the magnetic meridian without showing any tendency to\r\nmove northward or southward toward the rim of the vessel. Hartmann, who\r\nobserved the declination of the needle on land as stated on p. 26,\r\nappears also to have been the first to notice magnetic inclination.\r\nHaving balanced a steel needle with great precision, he found that,\r\nafter magnetization, it did not remain horizontal, the north-seeking end\r\ninvariably dipping through an angle of 9°. The smallness of the angle in\r\nthis experiment was due to the fact that the needle used by the\r\nNuremberg Vicar could move only in a horizontal plane, whereas Norman's\r\nwas free to move in a vertical circle. Had Hartmann used such a device,\r\nhe would have obtained more than 60° for the dip instead of the 9° which\r\nhe records.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6 Norman's illustration of magnetic dip]\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the letter in which Hartmann consigns these capital\r\nobservations was written in 1544, but was not published until the third\r\ndecade of the nineteenth century, so that Norman has clearly the full\r\nmerit of independent discovery.\r\n\r\nIn the directions which Norman gives for making observations of dip, he\r\nstates explicitly that the instrument must be adjusted \"duley according\r\nto the variation of the place,\" which means that the plane of the circle\r\nmust be turned into what was called after his time \"the magnetic\r\nmeridian.\"\r\n\r\nThe discovery of magnetic dip led Norman to discard the view generally\r\nheld in his time, which placed the controlling influence of the\r\ncompass-needle in far-off celestial space; for he says that the _poynt\r\nrespective_ which the magnet indicates, but to which it is not bodily\r\ndrawn, is not in the heavens above, but in the earth itself. His words\r\nare: \"And by the declining of the needle is also proved that the poynt\r\nrespective is rather in the earth than in the heavens, as some have\r\nimagined; and the greatest reason why they so thought, as I judge, was\r\nbecause they were never acquainted with this declining in the needle.\"\r\n\r\nHere we have a radical departure from the scientific creed of the time,\r\na notable advance in scientific theory, an entirely new philosophy\r\nfounded by Norman, the compass-maker, and greatly developed twenty-four\r\nyears later by his fellow-citizen, Gilbert, the physician.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7 Gilbert's _orb of virtue_, 1600]\r\n\r\nNorman made another remark of great importance in the new philosophy,\r\nthe justness of which was appreciated by Gilbert, his contemporary, but\r\nmore so by Faraday and Clerk Maxwell, two centuries later. It refers to\r\nthe space surrounding a magnet, natural or artificial, which cubical\r\nspace Gilbert, following Norman, called an _orb of virtue_. That the\r\ninfluence or \"effluvium\" of the magnet extends throughout the entire\r\nspace may readily be seen by carrying a compass-needle round a magnet\r\nfrom point to point, far away as well as close by. The phrase \"orb of\r\nvirtue,\" or sphere of magnetic influence, appears to describe the actual\r\nmagnetic condition of the space in question more pertinently than our\r\nmodern equivalent of \"magnetic field.\"\r\n\r\nThe words of Norman are very remarkable: \"I am of opinion that if this\r\nvertue could by anie means be made visible to the eie of man, it would\r\nbe found in a sphericall forme, extending round about the stone in great\r\ncompasse and the dead bodie of the stone in the middle thereof.\" The\r\nlines which immediately follow this statement, pregnant with\r\nsignificance, show the deep religious feeling of the author. They read:\r\n\"and this I have partly proved and made visible to be seene in some\r\nmanner, and God sparing mee life, I will herein make further experience\r\nand that not curiouslie but in the feare of God as neere as He shall\r\ngive me grace and meane to annexe the same unto a booke of navigation\r\nwhich I have had long in hand.\"--Chap. VIII.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the pages of the _Newe Attractive_ (1581) that Norman\r\nwas animated with the right spirit of inquiry, which is calm, deliberate\r\nand judicious, which leads to the discovery of facts, to their\r\ncoordination and experimental illustration before explanations are\r\nthought of and long before new theories are propounded. The style in\r\nwhich this little treatise is written has a charm of its own, mainly by\r\nreason of its quaintness. At the end of his address to the candid\r\nreader, which, after the manner of the times, was somewhat belabored and\r\nrhetorical in character, Norman breaks away from common inadequate\r\nprose; and, giving wings to his imagination, writes a lyric on the\r\nmagnet which is the first metrical composition in English that we have\r\non such a subject. It reads:--\r\n\r\n         THE MAGNES OR LOADSTONE'S CHALLENGE.\r\n\r\n           Give place ye glittering sparks,\r\n            ye glimmering Diamonds bright,\r\n           Ye Rubies red, and Saphires brave\r\n            wherein ye most delight.\r\n\r\n           In breefe, yee stones inricht,\r\n            and burnisht all with golde,\r\n           Set forth in Lapidaries shops,\r\n            for Jewells to be sold.\r\n\r\n           Give place, give place I say,\r\n            your beautie, gleame and glee,\r\n           Is all the vertue for the which,\r\n            accepted so you bee.\r\n\r\n           Magnes, the Loadstone I,\r\n            your painted sheath defie,\r\n           Without my help in Indian seas,\r\n            the best of you might lie.\r\n\r\n           I guide the Pilot's course,\r\n            his helping hand I am,\r\n           The Mariner delights in me,\r\n            so doth the Marchant man.\r\n\r\n           My vertue lies unknowne,\r\n            my secrets hidden are,\r\n           By me, the Court and Commonweale,\r\n            are pleasured very farre.\r\n\r\n           No ship could sail on Seas,\r\n            her course to run aright,\r\n           Nor Compass shew the ready way\r\n            were Magnes not of might.\r\n\r\n           Blush then, and blemish all,\r\n            bequeath to mee thats due,\r\n           Your seats in golde, your price in plate,\r\n            which Jewellers do renue.\r\n\r\n           Its I, its I alone,\r\n            whom you usurp upon,\r\n           Magnes my name, the Loadstone cal'd,\r\n            the prince of stones alone.\r\n\r\n           If this you can deny,\r\n            then seem to make reply,\r\n           And let the painfull sea-man judge,\r\n            the which of us doth lie.\r\n\r\n            THE MARINER'S JUDGEMENT.\r\n\r\n           The Loadstone is the stone,\r\n            the onely stone alone,\r\n           Deserving praise above the rest\r\n             whose vertues are unknown.\r\n\r\n             THE MARCHANT'S VERDICT.\r\n\r\n           The Diamonds bright, the Saphires brave,\r\n            Are stones that bear the name,\r\n           but flatter not, and tell the troath,\r\n            Magnes deserves the same.\r\n    (Edition of 1720.)\r\n\r\nNorman's _Newe Attractive_ was well known to Gilbert, as were also the\r\n_Epistola_ of Peregrinus, the _Magiae Naturalis_ of Porta, and indeed\r\nall books treating of the lodestone, the magnet, or the compass-needle.\r\nHis own work _De Magnete_, published in the year 1600, is a compendium\r\nof the world's knowledge of magnetism and electricity at the time. In\r\nits pages, he not only discusses the opinions of others, but describes\r\ndiscoveries of his own made during the twenty years which he ardently\r\ndevoted to the pursuit of experimental science, crowning his\r\ninvestigations with theories in electricity and magnetism as became a\r\ntrue philosopher.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the originality of Gilbert's treatise, the practical\r\ningenuity and philosophic acumen displayed throughout, Hallam wrote in\r\nhis _Introduction to the Literature of Europe_: \"Gilbert not only\r\ncollected all the knowledge which others had possessed on the subject,\r\nbut became at once the father of experimental philosophy in this island;\r\nand, by a singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of\r\ntheories which have been received after the lapse of ages and are almost\r\nuniversally received into the creed of science.\"\r\n\r\nAt a period when natural science was taught in the schools of Europe\r\nmainly from text-books, we find Gilbert proclaiming by example and\r\nadvocacy the paramount value of experiment for the advancement of\r\nlearning. He was unsparing in his denunciation of the superficiality\r\nand verbosity of mere bookmen, and had no patience with writers who\r\ntreated their subjects \"esoterically, reconditely and mystically.\" For\r\nhim, the laboratory method was the only one that could secure fruitful\r\nresults and contribute effectively to the advancement of learning.\r\n\r\nIt is true that men of unusual ability and strong character strove\r\nbefore his time to adjust the claims of authority in matters scientific.\r\nWhile respectful of the teachings of recognized leaders, they were not,\r\nhowever, awed into acquiescence by an academical \"magister dixit.\" On\r\nthe contrary, they wanted to test with their eyes in order to judge with\r\nreason; believing in the importance of experiment, they sought to\r\nacquire a knowledge of nature from nature herself.\r\n\r\nSuch were Albert the Great and Friar Bacon. Albert did not bow\r\nobsequiously to the authority of Aristotle or any of his Arabian\r\ncommentators; he investigated for himself and became, for his age, a\r\ndistinguished botanist, physiologist and mineralogist.\r\n\r\nThe Franciscan monk of Ilchester has left us in his _Opus Majus_ a\r\nlasting memorial of his practical genius. In the section entitled\r\n\"Scientia Experimentalis,\" he affirms that \"Without experiment, nothing\r\ncan be adequately known. An argument proves theoretically, but does not\r\ngive the certitude necessary to remove all doubt, nor will the mind\r\nrepose in the clear view of truth, unless it find it by way of\r\nexperiment.\" And in his _Opus Tertium_: \"The strongest arguments prove\r\nnothing, so long as the conclusions are not verified by experience.\r\nExperimental science is the queen of sciences and the goal of all\r\nspeculation.\"\r\n\r\nNo one, even in our own times, wrote more strongly in favor of the\r\npractical method than did this follower of St. Francis in the\r\nthirteenth century. Being convinced that there can be no conflict\r\nbetween scientific and revealed truths, he became an irrepressible\r\nadvocate for observation and experiment in the study of the phenomena\r\nand forces of nature.\r\n\r\nThe example of Peregrinus, of Albert and Friar Bacon, not to mention\r\nothers like Vincent of Beauvais, the Dominican encyclopedist, was,\r\nhowever, not sufficient to wean students from the easy-going routine of\r\nbook-learning. A few centuries had to elapse before the weaning was\r\neffectively begun; and the man who contributed in a marked degree to\r\nthis result was Gilbert the Philosopher of Colchester (1544-1603).\r\n\r\nHaving received the elements of his education in the Grammar School of\r\nColchester, his native town, Gilbert entered St. John's College,\r\nCambridge, from which university he took his B. A. degree in 1560, M. A.\r\nin 1564 and M. D. in 1569. In all, he appears to have been connected\r\nwith the University for a period of eleven or twelve years, as student,\r\nFellow, and examiner.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Cambridge, Gilbert traveled for four years on the Continent,\r\nprincipally in Italy, visiting medical schools and studying methods of\r\ntreatment under the leading physicians and surgeons of the day as well\r\nas discussing scientific theory with the leaders of thought. On his\r\nreturn to England in 1573, he practised medicine in London \"with great\r\napplause and success.\" He was elected President of the Royal College of\r\nPhysicians in 1599, and appointed Physician to Queen Elizabeth in 1601\r\nand to her successor, James I., in 1603.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, he hears that Baptista Porta, whom he calls \"a\r\nphilosopher of no ordinary note,\" said that a piece of iron rubbed with\r\na diamond turns to the north. He suspects this to be heresy. So,\r\nforthwith he proceeds to test the statement by experiment. He was not\r\ndazzled by the reputation of Baptista Porta; he respected Porta, but\r\nrespected truth even more. He tells us that he experimented with seventy\r\ndiamonds in presence of many witnesses, employing a number of iron bars\r\nand pieces of wire, manipulating them with the greatest care while they\r\nfloated on corks; and concludes his long and exhaustive research by\r\nplaintively saying: \"Yet never was it granted me to see the effect\r\nmentioned by Porta.\"\r\n\r\nThough it led to a negative result, this probing inquiry was a\r\nmasterpiece of experimental work.\r\n\r\nGilbert incidentally regrets that the men of his time \"are deplorably\r\nignorant with respect to natural things,\" and the only way he sees to\r\nremedy this is to make them \"quit the sort of learning that comes only\r\nfrom books and that rests only on vain arguments and conjectures,\" for\r\nhe shrewdly remarks that \"even men of acute intelligence without actual\r\nknowledge of facts and in the absence of experiment easily fall into\r\nerror.\"\r\n\r\nActing on this intimate conviction, he labored for twenty years over the\r\ntheories and experiments which he sets forth in his great work on the\r\nmagnet. \"There is naught in these books,\" he tells us, \"that has not\r\nbeen investigated, and again and again done and repeated under our\r\neyes.\" He begs any one that should feel disposed to challenge his\r\nresults to repeat the experiments for himself \"carefully, skilfully and\r\ndeftly, but not heedlessly and bunglingly.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that we are indebted to Sir Francis Bacon, Queen\r\nElizabeth's Chancellor, for the inductive method of studying the\r\nphenomena of nature. Bacon's merit lies in the fact that he not only\r\nminutely analyzed the method, pointing out its uses and abuses, but also\r\nthat he showed it to be the only one by which we can attain an accurate\r\nknowledge of the physical world around us. His sententious eulogy went\r\nforth to the world of scholars invested with all the importance,\r\nauthority and dignity which the high position and worldwide fame of the\r\nphilosophic Chancellor could give it. But while Bacon thought and wrote\r\nin his study, Gilbert labored and toiled in his workshop. By his pen,\r\nBacon made a profound impression on the philosophic mind of his age; by\r\nhis researches, Gilbert explored two provinces of nature and added them\r\nto the domain of science. Bacon was a theorist, Gilbert an investigator.\r\nFor twenty years he shunned the glare of society and the throbbing\r\nexcitement of public life; he wrenched himself away from all but the\r\nstrictest exigencies of his profession, in order to devote himself\r\nundistractedly to the pursuit of science. And all this forty years\r\nbefore the appearance of Bacon's _Novum Organum_, the very work which\r\ncontains the philosopher's \"large thoughts and lofty phrases\" on the\r\nvalue of experiment as a means for the advancement of learning. During\r\nthat long period Gilbert haunted Colchester, where he delved into the\r\nsecrets of nature and prepared the materials for his great work on the\r\nmagnet. The publication of this Latin treatise made him known in the\r\nuniversities at home and especially abroad: he was appreciated by all\r\nthe great physicists and mathematicians of his age; by such men as Sir\r\nKenelm Digby; by William Barlowe, a great \"magneticall\" man; by Kepler,\r\nthe astronomer, who adopted and defended his views; by Galileo himself,\r\nwho said: \"I extremely admire and envy the author of _De Magnete_.\"\r\n\r\nThe science of magnetism owes more to Gilbert than to any other man,\r\nPeregrinus (1269) excepted. He repeated for himself the numerous and\r\ningenious experiments of the medieval philosopher, and added much of his\r\nown which he discovered during the long period of a life devoted to the\r\ndiligent exploration of this domain in the world of natural knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe ancients spoke of the lodestone as the Magnesian stone, from its\r\nbeing found in abundance in the vicinity of Magnesia, a city of Asia\r\nMinor. In his Latin treatise of 254 (small) folio pages, Gilbert uses\r\nthe adjective form of the term, but never the noun \"Magnetismus\" itself.\r\nOur English term _magnetism_ appears for the first time on page 2 of\r\nArchdeacon Barlowe's \"Magneticall Advertisements,\" published in 1616;\r\nwhile the surprising compound, \"electro-magnetismos,\" is the title of a\r\nchapter in Father Kircher's \"Magnes, sive de Arte Magnetica,\" printed in\r\nthe year 1641.\r\n\r\nGilbert showed that a great number of bodies could be electrified; but\r\nmaintained that those only could exhibit magnetic properties which\r\ncontain iron. He satisfies himself of this by rubbing with a lodestone\r\nsuch substances as wood, gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, glass, etc.,\r\nand then floating them on corks, quaintly adding that they show \"no\r\npoles, because the energy of the lodestone has no entrance into their\r\ninterior.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day we know that nickel and cobalt behave like iron, whilst antimony,\r\nbismuth, copper, silver and gold are susceptible of being influenced by\r\npowerful electro-magnets, showing what has been termed diamagnetic\r\nphenomena. Even liquids and gases, in Faraday's classical experiments,\r\nyielded to the influence of his great magnet; and Professor Dewar, in\r\nthe same Royal Institution, exposed some of his liquid air and liquid\r\noxygen to the influence of Faraday's electromagnet and found them to be\r\nstrongly attracted, thus behaving like the paramagnetic bodies, iron,\r\nnickel and cobalt.\r\n\r\nGilbert observes in all his magnets two points, one near each end, in\r\nwhich the force, or, as he terms it, \"the supreme attractional power,\"\r\nis concentrated. Like Peregrinus, he calls these points the _poles_ of\r\nthe magnet, and the line joining them its magnetic axis. With the aid of\r\nhis steel versorium, he recognizes that similar poles are mutually\r\nhostile, whilst opposite poles seize and hold each other in friendly\r\nembrace. He also satisfies himself that the energy of magnets resides\r\nnot only in their extremities, but that it permeates \"their inmost\r\nparts, being entire in the whole and entire in each part.\" This is\r\nexactly what Peregrinus said in 1269 and what we say to-day; it is\r\nnothing else than the molecular theory proposed by Weber, extended by\r\nEwing and universally accepted.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Gilbert is quite certain that whatever magnetism may be, it\r\nis not, like electricity, a material, ponderable substance. He\r\nascertained this by weighing in the most accurate scales of a goldsmith\r\na rod of iron before and after it had been rubbed with the lodestone,\r\nand then observing that the weight is precisely the same in both cases,\r\nbeing \"neither less nor more.\"\r\n\r\nWithout referring to the prior discovery of Norman, whom he calls \"a\r\nskilled navigator and ingenious artificer,\" Gilbert satisfies himself\r\nthat not only the magnet, but all the space surrounding it, possesses\r\nmagnetic properties; for the magnet \"sends its force abroad in all\r\ndirections, according to its energy and quality.\" This region of\r\ninfluence Norman called a sphere of \"vertue,\" and Gilbert an \"orbis\r\nvirtutis,\" which is the Latin equivalent; we call it a \"magnetic field,\"\r\nor field of force, which is less expressive and less appropriate. With\r\nwonderful intuition, Gilbert sees this space filled with lines of\r\nmagnetic virtue passing out radially from his spherical lodestone, which\r\nlines he calls \"rays of magnetic force.\"\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell was so fascinated with this beautiful concept that he made\r\nit the work of his life to study the field of force due to electrified\r\nbodies, to magnets and to conductors conveying currents; his powerful\r\nintellect visualized those lines and gave them accurate mathematical\r\nexpression in the great treatise on electricity and magnetism which he\r\ngave to the world in 1873.\r\n\r\nGilbert observes that the lodestone may be spherical or oblong;\r\n\"whatever the shape, imperfect or irregular, verticity is present; there\r\nare poles,\" and the lodestones \"have the selfsame way of turning to the\r\npoles of the world.\" He knows that a compass-needle is not drawn bodily\r\ntowards the pole, and does not hesitate in this instance to give credit\r\nto his countryman, Robert Norman, for having clearly stated this fact\r\nand aptly demonstrated it. Following Norman, he floats a needle in a\r\nvessel by means of a piece of cork, and notices that on whatever part of\r\nthe surface of the water it may be placed, the needle settles down after\r\na few swings invariably in the same direction. His words are: \"It\r\nrevolves on its iron center and is not borne towards the rim of the\r\nvessel.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert knew nothing about the mechanical couple that came into play,\r\nbut he knew the fact; and, with the instinct of the philosopher, tested\r\nit in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nWe explain the orientation of the compass-needle by saying that it is\r\nacted upon by a pair of equal and opposite forces due to the influence\r\nof the terrestrial magnetic poles on each end of the needle and by\r\nshowing that such a couple can produce rotation, but not translation.\r\n\r\nWe find Gilbert working not only with steel needles and iron bars, but\r\nalso with rings of iron. He strokes them with a natural magnet and feels\r\ncertain that he has magnetized them. He assures us that \"one of the\r\npoles will be at the point rubbed and the other will be at the opposite\r\nside.\" To show that the ring is really magnetized, he cuts it across,\r\nopens it out, and finds that the ends exhibit polar properties.\r\n\r\nA favorite piece of apparatus with Gilbert, as with Peregrinus, was a\r\nlodestone ground down into globular form. He called it a terrella, a\r\nminiature earth, and used it extensively for reproducing the phenomena\r\ndescribed by magnetizers, travelers and navigators. He breaks up\r\nterrellas, in order to examine the magnetic condition of their inner\r\nparts. There is not a doubtful utterance in his description of what he\r\nfinds; he speaks clearly and emphatically. \"If magnetic bodies be\r\ndivided, or in any way broken up, each several part hath a north and a\r\nsouth end\"; _i.e._, each part will be a complete magnet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8 Behavior of compass-needle on a _terrella_ or\r\n  spherical lodestone]\r\n\r\nWe find him also comparing magnets by what is known to us as the\r\n\"magnetometer method.\" He brings the magnetized bars in turn near a\r\ncompass-needle and concludes that the magnet or the lodestone which is\r\nable to make the needle go round is the best and strongest. He also\r\nseeks to compare magnets by a process of weighing, similar to what is\r\ncalled, in laboratory parlance, the \"test-nail\" method. He also inquires\r\ninto the effect of heat upon his magnets, and finds that 'a lodestone\r\nsubjected to any great heat loses some of its energy.' He applies a\r\nred-hot iron to a compass-needle and notices that it 'stands still, not\r\nturning to the iron.' He thrusts a magnetized bar into the fire until it\r\nis red-hot and shows that it has lost all magnetic power. He does not\r\nstop at this remarkable discovery, for he proceeds to let his red-hot\r\nbars cool while lying in various positions, and finds: (1) that the bar\r\nwill acquire magnetic properties if it lie in the magnetic meridian; and\r\n(2) that it will acquire none if it lie east and west. These effects he\r\nrightly attributes to the inductive action of the earth.\r\n\r\nGilbert marks these and other experiments with marginal asterisks; small\r\nstars denoting minor and large ones important discoveries of his. There\r\nare in all 21 large and 178 small asterisks, as well as 84 illustrations\r\nin _De Magnete_. This implies a vast amount of original work, and forms\r\nno small contribution to the foundations of electric and magnetic\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nGilbert clearly realized the phenomena and laws of magnetic induction.\r\nHe tells us that \"as soon as a bar of iron comes within the lodestone's\r\nsphere of influence, though it be at some distance from the lodestone\r\nitself, the iron changes instantly and has its form renewed; it was\r\nbefore dormant and inert; but now is quick and active.\" He hangs a nail\r\nfrom a lodestone; a second nail from the first, a third from the second\r\nand so on--a well-known experiment, made every day for elementary\r\nclasses. Nor is this all, for he interposes between the lodestone and\r\nhis iron nail, thick boards, walls of pottery and marble, and even\r\nmetals, and he finds that there is naught so solid as to do away with\r\nits force or to check it, save a plate of iron. All that can be added to\r\nthis pregnant observation is that the plate of iron must be very thick\r\nin order to carry all the lines of force due to the magnet, and thus\r\ncompletely screen the space beyond.\r\n\r\nBut Gilbert is astonishing when he goes on to make thick boxes of gold,\r\nglass and marble; and, suspending his needle within them, declares with\r\nexcusable enthusiasm that, regardless of the box which imprisons the\r\nmagnet, it turns to its predestined points of north and south. He even\r\nconstructs a box of iron, places his magnet within, observes its\r\nbehavior, and concludes that it turns north and south, and would do so\r\nwere \"it shut up in iron vaults sufficiently roomy.\" In this, he was in\r\nerror, for experiments show that if the sides of the box are thin, the\r\nneedle will experience the directive force of the earth; but if they are\r\nsufficiently thick--thick as the walls of an ordinary safe--the inside\r\nof such a box will be completely screened; none of the earth's magnetic\r\nlines will get into it so that the needle will remain indifferently in\r\nany position in which it is placed. Some years ago, the physical\r\nlaboratory of St. John's College, Oxford, was screened from the\r\nobtrusive lines of neighboring dynamos by building two brick walls\r\nparallel to each other and eight inches apart and filling in the space\r\nwith scrap iron. A delicate magnetometer showed that such a structure\r\nallowed no leakage of lines of force through it, but offered an\r\nimpenetrable barrier to the magnetic influence of the working dynamos.\r\n\r\nGilbert's greatest discovery is that the earth itself acts as a vast\r\nglobular magnet having its magnetic poles, axis and equator. The pole\r\nwhich is in our hemisphere, he variously calls north, boreal or arctic.\r\nWhilst that in the other hemisphere he calls south, austral or\r\nantarctic. He sought to explain the magnetic condition of our globe by\r\nthe presence, especially in its innermost parts, of what he calls true,\r\nterrene matter, homogeneous in structure and endowed with magnetic\r\nproperties, so that every separate fragment exhibits the whole force of\r\nmagnetic matter. He is quite aware that his theory is a grand\r\ngeneralization; and admits that it is \"a new and till now unheard-of\r\nview,\" and so confident is he in its worth that he is not afraid to say\r\nthat \"it will stand as firm as aught that ever was produced in\r\nphilosophy, backed by ingenious argumentation or buttressed by\r\nmathematical demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nIn developing his theory of terrestrial magnetism, Gilbert fell into\r\ncertain errors, chiefly for want of data, but partly also by reason of\r\nhis adherence to the view that the earth exactly resembled his terrella\r\nin its magnetic action. Accordingly, he believed that the magnetic poles\r\nof the earth were diametrically opposite each other and that they\r\ncoincided with the poles of rotation, whence it followed that the\r\nmagnetic meridian everywhere coincided with the geographical, and that\r\nthe magnet, unless influenced by local disturbances, stood true to the\r\npole.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, well known from the thrilling experience of Columbus\r\nand the constant report of travelers that this was not the case. Gilbert\r\nhimself says that at the time of writing, in the year 1600, the needle\r\npointed 11-1/3° east of north in London; but what he did not know and\r\ncould not have known was that this easterly deviation was decreasing\r\nfrom year to year, to vanish altogether in 1657, after which the needle\r\nbegan to decline to the west.\r\n\r\nThis magnetic declination sorely perplexed Gilbert, as it did not fit in\r\nwith his theory. Yet an explanation was needed; and as the earth must be\r\nconsidered a normal and well-behaved magnet, though of cosmical size,\r\nGilbert turns the difficulty by saying that this variation is nothing\r\nelse than \"a sort of perturbation of the directive force\" caused by\r\ninequalities in the earth's surface by continents and mountain masses:\r\n\"Since the earth's surface is diversified by elevations of land and\r\ndepths of seas, great continental lands, oceans and seas differing in\r\nevery way while the power that produces all magnetic movements comes\r\nfrom the constant magnetic earth-substance which is strongest in the\r\nmost massive continent and not where the surface is water or fluid or\r\nunsettled, it follows that toward a massive body of land or continent\r\nrising to some height in any meridian, there is a measurable magnetic\r\nleaning from the true pole toward the east or the west.\"\r\n\r\nSo convinced is Gilbert of the true and satisfactory character of his\r\nexplanation that he goes on to say that, \"In northern regions, the\r\ncompass varies because of the northern eminences; in southern regions,\r\nbecause of southern eminences. On the equator, if the eminences on both\r\nsides were equal, there would be no variation.\" In a later chapter of\r\nBook IV., he adds that, \"in the heart of great continents there is no\r\nvariation; so, too, in the midst of great seas.\"\r\n\r\nAs continents and mountain-chains are among the permanent features of\r\nour planet, Gilbert concluded that the misdirection of the needle was\r\nlikewise permanent or constant at any given place, a conclusion which\r\nobservations made after Gilbert's time showed to be incorrect. Gilbert\r\nwrites: \"As the needle hath ever inclined toward the east or toward the\r\nwest, so even now does the arc of variation continue to be the same in\r\nwhatever place or region, be it sea or continent; so, too, will it be\r\nforever unchanging.\"\r\n\r\nThis we know to be untrue, and Gilbert, too, could have known as much\r\nhad he brought the experimental method, which he used with such\r\nconsummate skill and fruitful results in other departments of his\r\nfavorite studies, to bear on this particular element of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism. He labored with incredible ardor and persistence for twenty\r\nyears in his workshops at Colchester over the experiments in\r\nelectricity, magnetism and terrestrial magnetism which he embodies and\r\ndiscusses in his original and epoch-making book, _De Magnete_, published\r\nin the year 1600; a period of twenty years was long enough for such a\r\ncareful observer as he was to detect the slow change in magnetic\r\ndeclination discovered by his friend Gellibrand in 1634, published by\r\nhim in 1635, and known to-day as the \"secular variation.\" It is true the\r\nquantity to be measured was small; but what is surprising is that such\r\nan industrious and resourceful experimenter as Gilbert was does not\r\nrecord in his pages any observations of his own on declination or dip,\r\nelements of primary importance in magnetic theory.\r\n\r\nShortly after the voyage of Columbus it was thought that the _longitude_\r\nof a place could be found from its magnetic declination. Gilbert,\r\nhowever, did not think so, and accordingly scores those who championed\r\nthat view. \"Porta,\" he says, \"is deluded by a vain hope and a baseless\r\ntheory\"; Livius Sanutus \"sorely tortures himself and his readers with\r\nlike vanities\"; and even the researches of Stevin, the great Flemish\r\nmathematician, on the cause of variation in the southern regions of the\r\nearth are \"utterly vain and absurd.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to dip, Gilbert erroneously held that for any given latitude\r\nit had a constant value. He was so charmed with this constancy that he\r\nproposed it as a means of determining _latitude_. There is no diffidence\r\nin his mind about the matter; he is sure that with his \"inclinatorium\"\r\nor dip-circle, together with accompanying tables, calculated for him by\r\nBriggs, of logarithmic fame, an observer can find his latitude \"in any\r\npart of the world without the aid of the sun, planets or fixed stars in\r\nfoggy weather as well as in darkness.\"\r\n\r\nAfter such a statement, it is no wonder that he waxes warm over the\r\ncapabilities of his instrument and allows himself to exclaim: \"We can\r\nsee how far from idle is magnetic philosophy; on the contrary, how\r\ndelightful it is, how beneficial, how divine! Seamen tossed by the waves\r\nand vexed with incessant storms while they cannot learn even from the\r\nheavenly luminaries aught as to where on earth they are, may with the\r\ngreatest ease gain comfort from an insignificant instrument and\r\nascertain the latitude of the place where they happen to be.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert dwells at length on the inductive action of the earth. He\r\nhammers heated bars of iron on his anvil and then allows them to cool\r\nwhile lying in the magnetic meridian. He notes that they become\r\nmagnetized, and does not fail to point out the polarity of each end. He\r\nlikewise attributes to the influence of the earth the magnetic condition\r\nacquired by iron bars that have for a long time lain fixed in the\r\nnorth-and-south position and ingenuously adds: \"for great is the effect\r\nof long-continued direction of a body towards the poles.\" To the same\r\ncause, he attributes the magnetization of iron crosses attached to\r\nsteeples, towers, etc., and does not hesitate to say that the foot of\r\nthe cross always acquires north-seeking polarity.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, every vertical piece of iron, like railings,\r\nlamp-posts, and fire-irons, becomes a magnet under the inductive action\r\nof the earth. In the case of our modern ships, the magnetization of\r\nevery plate and vertical post, intensified by the hammering during\r\nconstruction, converts the whole vessel into a magnetic magazine, the\r\nresulting complex \"field\" rendering the adjustment of the compasses\r\nsomewhat difficult and unreliable. The unreliable character of the\r\nadjustment arises mainly from the changing magnetism of the ship with\r\nchange of place in the earth's magnetic field, the effect increasing\r\nslightly from the magnetic equator to the poles.\r\n\r\nWith luminous insight into the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism,\r\nGilbert observes that in the neighborhood of the poles, a\r\ncompass-needle, tending as it does to dip greatly, must in consequence\r\nexperience only a feeble directive power. To which he adds that \"at the\r\npoles there is no direction,\" meaning, no doubt, that a compass-needle\r\nwould remain in any horizontal position in which it might be placed when\r\nin the vicinity of the magnetic pole.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely the experience of all Arctic explorers, who find that\r\ntheir compasses become less and less active as they sail northward, the\r\nreason being that the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic\r\nforce, which alone controls the movements of the compass-needle,\r\ndecreases as the ship advances and vanishes altogether at the magnetic\r\npole. When once a high latitude is reached, captains do not depend upon\r\ntheir compasses for their bearings, but have recourse to astronomical\r\nobservations. In his account of magnetic work carried on in the\r\nneighborhood of the magnetic pole, Amundsen says: \"At Prescott Island\r\nthe compass, which for some time had been somewhat sluggish, refused\r\nentirely to act, and we could as well have used a stick to steer by.\"\r\n\r\nAs a physician, Gilbert valued iron for its medicinal properties, but\r\ndenounced quacks and wandering mountebanks who practised \"the vilest\r\nimposture for lucre's sake,\" using powdered lodestone for the cure of\r\nwounds and disorders. \"Headaches,\" he said, \"are no more cured by\r\napplication of a lodestone than by putting on an iron helmet or a steel\r\nhat\"; and again: \"To give it in a draught to dropsical persons is either\r\nan error of the ancients or an impudent tale of their copyists.\"\r\nElsewhere he condemns prescriptions of lodestone as \"an evil and deadly\r\nadvice\" and as \"an abominable imposture.\"\r\n\r\nIn the sixth and last book of _De Magnete_, Gilbert sets forth his views\r\non such astronomical subjects as the figure of the earth, its\r\nsuspension in space, rotation on its axis and revolution around the sun.\r\n\r\nAs to the figure of our planet, the primitive view widely credited in\r\nearly times was that the earth is a flat, uneven mass floating in a\r\nboundless ocean. The Hindoos, however, did not accept the flatland\r\ndoctrine, but taught that the earth was a convex mass which rested on\r\nthe back of a triad of elephants having for their support the carapace\r\nof a gigantic tortoise. Of course, they did not say how the complaisant\r\nchelonian contrived to maintain his wonderful state of equilibrium under\r\nthe superincumbent mass.\r\n\r\nAristotle (384-322, B. C.) taught that the earth, fixed in the center of\r\nthe universe, is not flat as a disk, but round as an orange, giving as\r\nproofs (1) the gradual disappearance of a ship standing out to sea and\r\n(2) the form of the shadow cast by the earth in lunar eclipses, to which\r\nothers added (3) the change in the altitude of circumpolar stars readily\r\nnoticeable in traveling north or south. Aristarchus of Samos (310-250),\r\none of the great astronomers of antiquity, went further, not fearing to\r\nteach that the earth is spherical in form, that it turns on its axis\r\ndaily and revolves annually around the sun. Such orthodox teaching did\r\nnot, however, commend itself to people generally, as they did not\r\nexactly like the idea of being whisked round with their houses and\r\ncities at a dangerous speed, preferring to explain celestial phenomena\r\nby the rotation of the vast celestial sphere, with all the starry host,\r\nround a flat, immovable earth. For them such a system of cosmography\r\nrecommended itself by its simplicity and reasonableness as well as by\r\nthe sense of stability, rest and comfort which it brought along with it.\r\n\r\nPtolemy, who flourished at Alexandria about 150 A. D. and whose name is\r\nassociated with a system of the world, also held that the earth is\r\nspherical in form, giving at the same time some very ingenious proofs of\r\nhis belief. St. Augustine, in the fourth century, was not opposed to the\r\ndoctrine of a round earth, though he felt the religious difficulty\r\narising from the existence of the antipodes, which difficulty reached\r\nits acute stage four hundred years later.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that the Church did not condemn the existence of\r\nan antipodean world; what it did condemn was the teaching of Virgilius,\r\nBishop of Salzburg, to the effect that this world, lying under the\r\nequator, was inhabited by a race of men not descended from Adam.\r\nVirgilius also taught that the antipodes had a sun and moon different\r\nfrom ours, an astronomical opinion for which he was never molested by\r\necclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\nBoethius, the worthy representative of the natural and the higher\r\nphilosophy of the sixth century, wrote of the earth as globe-like in\r\nform, but small in comparison with the heavens. Isidore of Seville, in\r\nthe seventh century, \"the most learned man of his age,\" and the\r\nencyclopedic Bede, in the eighth, rejected the theory of a flat,\r\ndiscoidal earth and returned to the spherical form of the early Greek\r\nastronomers. But again, centuries had to elapse before people could be\r\nbrought to tolerate views of the world that seemed so directly opposed\r\nto the daily testimony of their senses.\r\n\r\nThe strong, conclusive arguments which alone establish this theory on a\r\nfirm basis were, however, not known to Copernicus and could not have\r\nbeen known in an age that preceded the invention of the telescope and in\r\nwhich the astronomer had to be the constructor of his own crude wooden\r\ninstruments. The wonder is that Copernicus did such excellent\r\nobservational work on the banks of the Vistula with the rough appliances\r\nat his disposal. The arguments which he put forward and urged with\r\nconsummate skill for the acceptance of his revolutionary theory were its\r\ngeneral simplicity and probability. Of proofs clear and decisive, he\r\ngave none; yet, while he was working on his epoch-making treatise, begun\r\nin 1507 and published in 1543 with dedication to Pope Paul III., a\r\ndirect proof of the earth's spherical form was given by the return\r\n(1528) from the Philippines along an eastern route of one of Magellan's\r\nships, which had reached those distant isles after crossing the western\r\nocean, which the Portuguese navigator called the \"Pacific,\" from the\r\ntranquility of its waters. For a direct proof of the earth's _annual_\r\nmotion, the world had to wait two hundred years more, until Bradley\r\ndiscovered the \"aberration of light\" in 1729; and for a direct\r\ndemonstration of its _diurnal_ motion until Foucault made his pendulum\r\nexperiment in the Panthéon, in 1851.\r\n\r\nWe cannot let Gilbert's reference to a \"weightless earth\" pass without a\r\nfew remarks to justify our approval of the statement.\r\n\r\nThe idea connoted by the term weight is the pull which the earth exerts\r\non the mass of a body; thus, when we say that an iron ball weighs six\r\npounds, we mean that the earth pulls it downwards with a force equal to\r\nthe weight of six pounds. That the weight of a given lump of matter is\r\nnot a constant but a dependent quantity may be seen from a number of\r\nconsiderations. Its weight in vacuo, for instance, is different from its\r\nweight in air, and this latter differs considerably from its weight in\r\nwater or in oil. Again, if we take our experimental ball down the shaft\r\nof a mine, the spring-balance used to measure the pull of the earth on\r\nit will not record six pounds but something less; and the further we\r\ndescend, the less will the spring-balance be found to register. At a\r\ndepth of two thousand miles below the surface, the ball would be found\r\nto have lost half its weight; and at a depth of four thousand, all its\r\nweight. At the earth's center a \"box of weights\" would still be called a\r\n\"box of weights,\" though neither the box itself nor its enclosed\r\nstandards singly or collectively would have any weight whatever. It has\r\nbeen shown experimentally that two masses weigh slightly less when\r\nplaced one above the other than when placed side by side, because in the\r\nlatter case their common mass-center is measurably nearer to the center\r\nof the earth. Every mother knows that when a boy is sent to buy a pound\r\nof candy, it is the mass of the sweet stuff that makes him happy, and\r\nnot its weight, for this acts more like an incumbrance while he is\r\nbringing it home. Of course, weight is every day used, and correctly, as\r\na measure of mass, for every student of mechanics writes without the\r\nleast hesitation,\r\n\r\n  W=Mg.\r\n\r\nby which he simply means that the weight of a body is directly\r\nproportional to its mass (M), which is constant wherever the body may be\r\ntaken, and to the intensity of gravity (g), which varies slightly with\r\ngeographical position. As both scale-pans of an ordinary balance are\r\nequally affected by the local value of _g_, it follows that equilibrium\r\nis established only when the two _masses_--that of the body and that of\r\nthe standards--are themselves equal: hence weighing is in reality only a\r\nprocess of comparing masses, _i.e._, a process of \"massing.\"\r\n\r\nIf we bring our experimental ball to the top of a hill or to the summit\r\nof a mountain or aloft in a balloon, we find the pull on the registering\r\nspring growing less and less as we go higher and higher, from which we\r\nnaturally conclude that if we could go far enough out into\r\ncircumterrestrial space, say, towards the moon, the ball would lose its\r\nweight entirely; it would cease to stretch the spring of the measuring\r\nbalance, its weight vanishing at a definite, calculable distance from\r\nthe earth's center. If carried beyond that point the ball would come\r\nunder the moon's preponderating attraction and would begin to depress\r\nanew the index of the balance until at the surface of our satellite it\r\nwould be found to weigh exactly _one_ pound. If transferred to the\r\nplanet Mars the ball would weigh _two_ pounds, and if to the surface of\r\nthe giant planet Jupiter, _sixteen_ pounds. But while its weight thus\r\nchanges continually, its mass or quantity of matter, the stuff of which\r\nit is made, remains constant all the while, being equally unaffected by\r\nsuch variables as motion, position or even temperature.\r\n\r\nReturning from celestial space to our more congenial terrestrial\r\nsurroundings, we find a similar inconstancy in the weight of the ball as\r\nwe travel from the equator toward either pole, the weight being least at\r\nthe equator and slightly greater at either end of our axis of rotation.\r\nThis change is fully accounted for by the spheroidal figure of the earth\r\nand its motion of rotation, in virtue of which, while going from the\r\nequator toward the pole, our distance from the center of attraction\r\nundergoes a slight diminution, as does also the component of the local\r\ncentrifugal force, which is in opposition to gravity.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, it will be seen that the weight of a body is more of the\r\nnature of an accidental rather than an essential property of matter,\r\nwhereas its mass is a necessary and unvarying property. Hence we speak\r\nwith propriety of the conservation of mass just as we speak with equal\r\npropriety of the conservation of energy; but we may never speak or write\r\nof the conservation of weight. The mass of our iron ball is precisely\r\nthe same away from the surface of the earth as it is anywhere on the\r\nsurface, whether a thousand miles below the surface or a thousand miles\r\nabove it; and the same it would be found in any part of the solar system\r\nor of the starry universe to which it might be taken.\r\n\r\nSince weight is nothing else than the pull which the earth exerts on a\r\nbody, it follows that, big and massive as our planet is, it must,\r\nnevertheless, be weightless; for it cannot with any degree of propriety\r\nbe said to pull itself. It is incapable of producing even an\r\ninfinitesimal change in the position of its mass-center, or center of\r\ngravity, as this centroid is sometimes called. The earth attracts\r\n_itself_ with no force whatever; but is attracted and governed in its\r\nannual movement by the sun, the central controlling body of our system,\r\nwhile the moon and planets play only the part of petty disturbers.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be right to speak of the _weight_ of the earth\r\n_relatively_ to the sun; for the sun attracts the mass of our planet\r\nwith a certain definite force, readily calculable from the familiar\r\nformula for central force, viz., mv^2/r., in which _m_ is the mass of\r\nthe earth, _v_ its orbital velocity and _r_ its distance from the sun.\r\nSupplying the numbers, the weight of the earth relatively to the sun,\r\ncomes out to be\r\n\r\n3,000000,000000,000000 or 3×10^{18} tons weight,\r\n\r\nor, in words, three million million million tons weight.\r\n\r\nIt may here be noted that the velocity _v_ of the earth in its orbit is\r\na varying quantity, depending on distance from the sun. As this distance\r\nis least in December and greatest in June, it follows that the earth is\r\nheavier relatively to the sun in winter than it is in summer.\r\n\r\nThe _mass_ of the earth, on the other hand, is not a relative and\r\nvariable quantity, but a constant and independent one, which would not\r\nbe affected either by the sudden annihilation of all the other members\r\nof the solar system or by the instantaneous or successive addition of a\r\nthousand orbs. Mass being the product of volume by density, that of the\r\nearth is 6000,000000,000000,000000 or 6×10^{21} tons mass, which reads\r\nsix thousand million million million tons mass.\r\n\r\nThe number which expresses the mass of the earth is thus very different\r\nfrom that which represents its weight relatively to the sun. It is\r\nobvious that the latter would be a much greater quantity if our planet\r\nwere transferred to the orbit of Venus and very much less if transferred\r\nto that of far-off Jupiter, but the number which expresses its _mass_\r\nwould remain precisely the same in both cases, viz., the value given\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn elaborating his theory of magnetism, and especially his magnetic\r\ntheory of the earth, Gilbert made extensive use of lodestone-globes,\r\nwhich he called \"terrellas,\" _i.e._, miniature models of the earth. In\r\npursuing his searching inquiry, he was gradually led from these\r\n\"terrellas\" to his great induction that the earth itself is a colossal,\r\nglobe-like magnet. Following Norman, \"the ingenious artificer,\" of\r\nLimehouse, London, he also showed that the entire cubical space which\r\nsurrounds a lodestone is an \"orb of virtue,\" or region of influence,\r\nfrom which he inferred that the earth itself must have its \"orb of\r\nvirtue,\" or magnetic field, extending outward to a very great distance.\r\n\r\nGilbert does not, for a moment, think that this theory of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism, the first ever given to the world, is a wild speculation. Far\r\nfrom it; he is convinced that \"it will stand as firm as aught that ever\r\nwas produced in philosophy, backed by ingenious argumentation or\r\nbuttressed by mathematical demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nIf the earth has a magnetic field, he argued, why not the moon, the\r\nplanets and the sun itself, \"the mover and inciter of the universe\"?\r\nGiven these planetary magnetic fields, Gilbert seems to have no\r\ndifficulty in finding out the forces necessary to account for the\r\ncrucial difficulties of the Copernican doctrine. Nor is the medium\r\nabsent that is needed for the mutual action of magnetic globes, for we\r\nare assured that it is none other than the universal _ether_, which, he\r\nsays \"is without resistance.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert disposes of the cosmographic puzzle of the \"suspension\" of the\r\nearth in space by saying, and saying justly, that the earth \"has no\r\nheaviness of its own,\" and, therefore, \"does not stray away into every\r\nregion of the sky.\" To emphasize the statement, he continues: \"The\r\nearth, in its own place, is in no wise heavy, nor does it need any\r\nbalancing\"; and again, \"The whole earth itself has no weight.\" \"By the\r\nwonderful wisdom of the Creator,\" he elsewhere says, \"forces were\r\nimplanted in the earth that the globe itself might with steadfastness\r\ntake direction.\"\r\n\r\nGilbert holds that the daily rotation of the earth on its axis is also\r\ncaused, and maintained with strict uniformity, by the same prevalent\r\nsystem of magnetic forces, for \"lest the earth should in divers ways\r\nperish and be destroyed, she rotates in virtue of her _magnetic energy_,\r\nand such also are the movements of the rest of the planets.\"\r\n\r\nJust how this magnetic energy acts to produce the rotatory motion of a\r\nmassive globe Gilbert does not say. Nor was he able to solve such a\r\nmagnetic riddle, for there was nothing in his philosophy to explain how\r\na lodestone-globe in free space should ever become a perpetual magnetic\r\nmotor. Oddly enough he disagrees with Peregrinus, who maintained in his\r\n_Epistola_, 1269, that a terrella, or spherical lodestone, poised in the\r\nmeridian, would turn on its axis regularly every 24 hours. He naively\r\nsays: \"We have never chanced to see this; nay, we doubt if there is such\r\na movement.\" Continuing, he brings out his clinching argument: \"This\r\ndaily rotation seems to some philosophers wonderful and incredible\r\nbecause of the ingrained belief that the mighty mass of earth makes an\r\norbital movement in 24 hours; it were more incredible that the moon\r\nshould in the space of 24 hours traverse her orbit or complete her\r\ncourse; more incredible that the sun and Mars should do so; still more\r\nthat Jupiter and Saturn; more than wonderful would be the velocity of\r\nthe fixed stars and firmament.\"\r\n\r\nHere he finds himself obliged to berate Ptolemy for being \"over-timid\r\nand scrupulous in apprehending a break up of this nether world were the\r\nearth to move in a circle. Why does he not apprehend universal ruin,\r\ndissolution, confusion, conflagration and stupendous celestial and\r\nsuper-celestial calamities from a motion (that of the starry sphere)\r\nwhich surpasses all imagination, all dreams and fables and poetic\r\nlicense, a motion ineffable and inconceivable?\"\r\n\r\nGilbert is not clear and emphatic on the other doctrine of Copernicus,\r\nthe revolution of the earth and planets around the sun. He does,\r\nhowever, say that each of the moving globes \"has circular motion either\r\nin a great circular orbit or on its own axis, or in both ways.\" Again:\r\n\"The earth by some great necessity, even by a virtue innate, evident and\r\nconspicuous, is turned circularly about the sun.\" Elsewhere he affirms\r\nthat the moon circles round the earth \"by a magnetic compact of both.\"\r\nHe returns to this point in his _De Mundo Nostro_, saying, \"The force\r\nwhich emanates from the moon reaches to the earth; and, in like manner,\r\nthe _magnetic virtue_ of the earth pervades the region of the moon.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here an implied interaction between two magnetic fields, rather\r\na clever idea for a magnetician of the sixteenth century. In one case,\r\nthe reaction is between the field of the earth and that of the moon,\r\ncompelling the latter to rotate round its primary once every month; and\r\nthe second, between the field of the earth and that of the sun,\r\ncompelling our planet to revolve round the center of our system once\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\nThough an inefficient cause of the annual motion of our planet, this\r\ninteraction of two magnetic fields had, nevertheless, something in\r\ncommon with the idea of the mutual action of material particles\r\npostulated in the Newtonian theory of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nThis magnetic assumption by which Gilbert sought to defend the theory of\r\nthe universe propounded by Copernicus was a very vulnerable point in\r\nhis astronomical armor which was promptly detected and fiercely assailed\r\nby a galaxy of continental writers; all of them churchmen, physicists\r\nand astronomers of note. They accepted Gilbert's electric and magnetic\r\ndiscoveries and warmed up to his experimental method; they did not\r\ndiscard his theory of terrestrial magnetism, but rejected and scoffed at\r\nthe use which he made of it to justify the heliocentric theory. They\r\npoked fun at the English philosopher for his magnetic hypothesis of\r\nplanetary rotation and revolution, and succeeded in discrediting the\r\nCopernican doctrine. Error prevailed for a time, but Newton's\r\n_Principia_, published in 1687, gave the Ptolemaic system the _coup de\r\ngrâce_. Gilbert's hypothesis of the interaction of planetary magnetic\r\nfields gave way to universal gravitation, and Copernicanism was finally\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\nThroughout the pages of Gilbert's treatise, he shows himself remarkably\r\nchary in bestowing praise, but surprisingly vigorous in denunciation.\r\nSt. Thomas is an instance of the former, for it is said that he gets at\r\nthe nature of the lodestone fairly well; and it is admitted that \"with\r\nhis godlike and perspicacious mind, he would have developed many a point\r\nhad he been acquainted with magnetic experiments.\" Taisnier, the\r\nBelgian, is an example of the latter, whose plagiarism from Peregrinus\r\nwrings from our indignant author such withering words as \"May the gods\r\ndamn all such sham, pilfered, distorted works, which so muddle the minds\r\nof students!\"\r\n\r\nBesides his treatise on the magnet, Gilbert is the author of an\r\nextensive work entitled, \"De Mundo Nostro Sublunari,\" in which he\r\ndefends the modern system of the universe propounded by Copernicus and\r\ngives his views on important cosmical problems. This work was published\r\nafter the author's death, first at Stettin in 1628, and again at\r\nAmsterdam in 1651.\r\n\r\nChancellor Bacon was well acquainted with this treatise of our\r\nphilosopher; indeed he had in his collection the only two manuscript\r\ncopies ever made, one in Latin and the other in English, a very singular\r\nand significant fact in view of the Chancellor's attitude toward\r\nGilbert. Putting it crudely, one would like to know how he obtained\r\npossession of the manuscripts and what was his motive in keeping them\r\nhidden away from the philosophers of the day. \"It is considered\r\nsurprising,\" writes Prof. Silvanus P. Thompson, \"that Bacon, who had the\r\nmanuscripts in his possession and held them for years unpublished,\r\nshould have written severe strictures upon their dead author and his\r\nmethods, while at the very same time posing as the discoverer of the\r\ninductive method in science, a method which Gilberd (Gilbert) had\r\npractised for years before.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThat Bacon was no admirer of Gilbert's physical and cosmical theories\r\nthe following passages will show. In the \"Novum Organum\" the Chancellor\r\nwrote: \"His philosophy is an instance of extravagant speculation founded\r\non insufficient data\"; again, \"As the alchemists made a philosophy out\r\nof a few experiments of the furnace, Gilbert, our countryman, hath made\r\na philosophy out of the lodestone\" (\"The Advancement of Learning\");\r\nlastly, \"Gilbert hath attempted a general system on the magnet,\r\nendeavoring to build a ship out of materials not sufficient to make the\r\nrowing-pins of a boat\" (\"De Augmentis Scientiarum\").\r\n\r\nOne is tempted to ask how this strange disregard which Bacon entertained\r\nfor the scientific views of the greatest natural philosopher of his age\r\nand country came to exist? Was it due to a feeling of jealousy that\r\ncould not brook a rival in the domain of the higher philosophy, or was\r\nit because Bacon, the anti-Copernican, wanted to write down Gilbert, the\r\ndefender of the heliocentric theory, in the British Isles?\r\n\r\nWhen reading Bacon's depreciatory remarks we have to remember that his\r\nmathematical and physical outfit was very limited even for the age in\r\nwhich he lived; from which it is safe to infer that he was but little\r\nqualified to pass judgment on the value of the electric and magnetic\r\nwork accomplished in the workshops at Colchester or on the theories to\r\nwhich they gave rise.\r\n\r\nBacon deserves praise for denouncing the prevalent system of natural\r\nphilosophy which was mainly authoritative, speculative and syllogistic\r\ninstead of experimental, deductive and inductive, but he was\r\ninconsistent and forgetful of his own principles when he belittled the\r\ngreatest living enemy of mere book-learning, and the most earnest\r\nadvocate, by word and example, of the laboratory methods for the\r\nadvancement of learning.\r\n\r\nTo avoid misapprehension, it should be here stated that Bacon was not\r\nalways censorious in his treatment of his illustrious fellow-citizen,\r\nfor in several places he writes approvingly of the electric and magnetic\r\nexperiments contained in _De Magnete_, which he calls in his\r\n_Advancement of Learning_, \"a painfull (_i.e._, painstaking)\r\nexperimentall booke.\" In other places he draws so freely on Gilbert\r\nwithout acknowledgment as to come dangerously near the suspicion of\r\nplagiarism.\r\n\r\nGilbert died, probably of the plague, in the sixtieth year of his age,\r\non December 10th, 1603, and was buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity\r\nChurch, Colchester, where a mural tablet records in Latin the chief\r\nfacts of his life.\r\n\r\nDr. Fuller in his \"Worthies of England\" (1662) describes Gilbert as tall\r\nof stature and cheerful of \"complexion,\" a happiness, he quaintly\r\nremarks, not ordinarily found in so hard a student and retired a\r\nperson.\" Concluding his appreciation of the philosopher, Fuller writes:\r\n\"Mahomet's tomb at Mecha[6] is said strangely to hang up, attracted by\r\nsome invisible loadstone; but the memory of this Doctor will never fall\r\nto the ground, which his incomparable book _De Magnete_ will support to\r\neternity.\"\r\n\r\nAnimated by a similar spirit of national pride, Dryden wrote\r\n\r\n    Gilbert shall live till loadstones cease to draw,\r\n    Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe.\r\n\r\nWe shall close these remarks by Hallam's estimate of Gilbert as a\r\nscientific pioneer, contained in his _Introduction to the Literature of\r\nEurope_. \"The year 1600,\" he says, \"was the first in which England\r\nproduced a remarkable work in physical science; but this was one\r\nsufficient to raise a lasting reputation for its author. Gilbert, a\r\nphysician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet, not only collected all\r\nthe knowledge which others had possessed on the subject, but became at\r\nonce the father of experimental philosophy in this island; and, by a\r\nsingular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which\r\nhave been revived after a lapse of ages and are almost universally\r\nreceived into the creed of science.\"\r\n\r\nFor well-nigh three hundred years, _De Magnete_ remained untranslated,\r\nbeing read only by the scholarly few. The first translation was made by\r\nP. Fleury Mottelay, of New York, and published by Messrs. Wiley and Sons\r\nin the year 1893. Mr. Mottelay has given much attention to the\r\nbibliography of the twin sciences of electricity and magnetism, as the\r\nfoot-notes which he has added to the translation abundantly prove.\r\n\r\nA second translation appeared in the tercentenary year, 1900, and was\r\nthe work of the members of the Gilbert Club, London, among whom were Dr.\r\nJoseph Larmor and Prof. Silvanus P. Thompson. It is a page-for-page\r\ntranslation with facsimile illustrations, initial letters and\r\ntail-pieces.\r\n\r\nAs one would infer from the numerous references contained in _De\r\nMagnete_, Gilbert had a considerable collection of valuable books,\r\nclassical and modern, bearing on the subject of his life-work; but\r\nthese, as well as his terrellas, globes, minerals and instruments,\r\nperished in the great fire of London, 1666, with the buildings of the\r\nCollege of Physicians, in which they were located.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Gilbert was preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, for\r\nmany years; but has long since disappeared from its walls. On the\r\noccasion of the three hundredth anniversary (1903) of Gilbert's death, a\r\nfine painting representing the Doctor in the act of showing some of his\r\nelectrical experiments to Queen Elizabeth and her court (including Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, Sir Francis Drake and Cecil, Lord Burleigh, famous\r\nSecretary of State), was presented to the Mayor of Colchester by the\r\nLondon Institute of Electrical Engineers. A replica of the painting was\r\nsent to the St. Louis Exposition, 1904, where it formed one of the\r\nattractions of the Electricity Building.\r\n\r\nThe house in which Gilbert was born (1544) still stands in Holy Trinity\r\nStreet, Colchester, where it is frequently visited by persons interested\r\nin the history of electric and magnetic science.\r\n\r\nBROTHER POTAMIAN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] \"Souvenir of Gilberd's Tercentenary,\" p. 6.\r\n\r\n[7] See magnetic myths, page 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN AND SOME CONTEMPORARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already seen, the writers of Greece and Rome knew little about the\r\nlodestone; we have now to add that the knowledge of electricity which\r\nthey possessed was of the same elementary character. They knew that\r\ncertain resinous substances, such as amber and jet had, when rubbed, the\r\nproperty of attracting straws, feathers, dry leaves and other light\r\nbodies; beyond this, their philosophy did not go. The Middle Ages added\r\nlittle to the subject, as the Schoolmen were occupied with questions of\r\na higher order. The Saxon Heptarchy came and went, Alcuin taught in the\r\nschools of Charlemagne, Cardinal Langton compelled a landless and\r\nworthless king to sign Magna Charta, universities were founded with\r\nPapal sanction in Italy, France, Germany, England and Scotland,\r\nCopernicus wrote his treatise on the revolution of heavenly bodies and\r\ndedicated it to Pope Paul III., Tycho Brahé made his famous astronomical\r\nobservations at Uranienborg and befriended at Prague the penniless\r\nKepler, and Columbus gave a New World to Castile and Leon--all this\r\nbefore the man appeared who, using amber as guide, discovered a new\r\nworld of phenomena, of thought and philosophy. This man was no other\r\nthat Gilbert, whose discoveries in magnetism were described in an\r\nearlier chapter. The trunk line of his work was magnetism; electricity\r\nwas only a siding. One was the main subject of a life-long quest while\r\nthe other was only a digression. It was a digression in which the\r\nqualities of the native-born investigator are seen at their very best:\r\nalertness and earnestness, resourcefulness and perseverance, all\r\nrewarded by a rich harvest of valuable results. It is refreshing and\r\ninspiring to read the Second Book of Gilbert's treatise, _De Magnete_,\r\nin which are recorded in quick succession the twenty important\r\ndiscoveries which he made in his new field of labor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9 Gilbert's \"versorium\" or electroscope]\r\n\r\nAt the very outset, he found it necessary to invent a recording\r\ninstrument to test the electrification produced by rubbing a great\r\nvariety of substances. This he appropriately called a _versorium_; we\r\nwould call it an electroscope. \"Make to yourself,\" he says, \"a rotating\r\nneedle of any sort of metal three or four fingers long and pretty light\r\nand poised on a sharp point.\" He then briskly rubs and brings near his\r\nversorium glass, sulphur, opal, diamond, sapphire, carbuncle,\r\nrock-crystal, sealing-wax, alum, resin, etc., and finds that all these\r\nattract his suspended needle, and not only the needle, but everything\r\nelse. His words are remarkable: \"All things are drawn to electrics.\"\r\nHere is a great advance on the amber and jet, the only two bodies\r\npreviously known as having the power to attract \"straws, chaff and\r\ntwigs,\" the usual test-substances of the ancients. Pursuing his\r\ninvestigations, he finds numerous bodies which perplex him, because when\r\nrubbed they do not affect his electroscope. Among these, he enumerates:\r\nbone, ivory, marble, flint, silver, copper, gold, iron, even the\r\nlodestone itself. The former class he called _electrica_, electrics; the\r\nlatter was termed _anelectrica_, non-electrics.\r\n\r\nTo Gilbert we, therefore, are indebted for the terms electric and\r\nelectrical, which he took from the Greek name for amber instead of\r\nsuccinic and succinical, their Latin equivalents. The noun electricity\r\nwas a coinage of a later period, due probably to Sir Thomas Browne, in\r\nwhose _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_, 1646, it occurs in the singular number on\r\npage 51 and in the plural on page 79. It may interest the reader to be\r\nhere retold that we owe the chemical term _affinity_ to Albertus Magnus,\r\n_barometer_ to Boyle, _gas_ to van Helmont, _magnetism_ to Barlowe,\r\nmagnetic _inclination_ to Bond, electric _circuit_ to Watson, electric\r\n_potential_ to Green, _galvanometer_ to Cumming, _electro-magnetism_ to\r\nKircher, _electromagnet_ to Sturgeon, and _telephone_ to Wheatstone.\r\n\r\nGilbert was perplexed by the anomalous behavior of his non-electrics. He\r\ntoiled and labored hard to find out the cause. He undertook a long,\r\nabstract, philosophical discussion on the nature of bodies which, from\r\nits very subtlety, failed to reveal the cause of his perplexing\r\nanomaly. Gilbert failed to discover the distinction between conductors\r\nand insulators; and, as a consequence, never found out that similarly\r\nelectrified bodies repel each other. Had he but suspended an excited\r\nstick of sealing-wax, what a promised land of electrical wonders would\r\nhave unfolded itself to his vision and what a harvest of results such a\r\nreaper would have gathered in! From solids, Gilbert proceeds to examine\r\nthe behavior of liquids, and finds that they, too, are susceptible of\r\nelectrical influence. He notices that a piece of rubbed amber when\r\nbrought near a drop of water deforms it, drawing it out into a conical\r\nshape. He even experiments with smoke, concluding that the small carbon\r\nparticles are attracted by an electrified body. Some years ago, Sir\r\nOliver Lodge, extending this observation, proposed to lay the poisonous\r\ndust floating about in the atmosphere of lead works by means of large\r\nelectrostatic machines. He even hinted in his Royal Institution lecture\r\nthat they might be useful in dissipating mists and fogs, and recommended\r\nthat a trial be made on some of our ocean-steamers.\r\n\r\nGilbert next tries heat as an agent to produce electrification. He takes\r\na red-hot coal and finds that it has no effect on his electroscope; he\r\nheats a mass of iron up to whiteness and finds that it, too, exerts no\r\nelectrical effect. He tries a flame, a candle, a burning torch, and\r\nconcludes that all bodies are attracted by electrics save those that are\r\nafire or flaming, or extremely rarefied. He then reverses the\r\nexperiment, bringing near an excited body the flame of a lamp, and\r\ningenuously states that the body no longer attracts the pivoted needle.\r\nHe thus discovered the neutralizing effect of flames, and supplied us\r\nwith the readiest means that we have to-day for discharging\r\nnon-conductors.\r\n\r\nHe goes a step further; for we find him exposing some of his electrics\r\nto the action of the sun's rays in order to see whether they acquired a\r\ncharge; but all his results were negative. He then concentrates the rays\r\nof the sun by means of lenses, evidently expecting some electrical\r\neffect; but finding none, concludes with a vein of pathos that the sun\r\nimparts no power, but dissipates and spoils the electric effluvium.\r\n\r\nProfessor Righi has shown that a clean metallic plate acquires a\r\npositive charge when exposed to the ultraviolet radiation from any\r\nartificial source of light, but that it does not when exposed to solar\r\nrays. The absence of electrical effects in the latter case is attributed\r\nto the absorptive action of the atmosphere on the shorter waves of the\r\nsolar beam.\r\n\r\nOf course Gilbert permits himself some speculation as to the nature of\r\nthe agent with which he was dealing. He thought of it, reasoned about\r\nit, pursued it in every way; and came to the conclusion that it must be\r\nsomething extremely tenuous indeed, but yet substantial, ponderable,\r\nmaterial. \"As air is the effluvium of the earth,\" he says, \"so\r\nelectrified bodies have an effluvium of their own, which they emit when\r\nstimulated or excited\"; and again: \"It is probable that amber exhales\r\nsomething peculiar that attracts the bodies themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThese views are quite in line with the electronic theory of electricity\r\nin vogue to-day, which invests that elusive entity with an atomic\r\nstructure. It is held that the tiny particles or electrons that are shot\r\nout from the cathode terminal of a vacuum tube with astounding velocity\r\nare none other than particles of negative electricity, pure and simple.\r\nThey have mass and inertia, both of which properties are held to be\r\nentirely electrical, though quite analogous to the mass and inertia of\r\nordinary, ponderable matter.\r\n\r\nHistory shows that scientific theories have their periods of infancy,\r\nmaturity and decay. When they have served their purpose, like the\r\nscaffolding of a building, they are removed from sight and stored away,\r\nsay, in a limbo of discarded philosophy, for use of the historian of\r\nscience or of the metaphysician writing on the nature of human\r\nknowledge. Such was the fate of Gilbert's \"effluvium\" theory of\r\nelectricity, of the fluid theories of Dufay and Franklin, and the\r\nether-strain theory of recent years. \"Each physical hypothesis,\" says\r\nProf. Fleming, \"serves as a lamp to conduct us a certain stage in the\r\njourney. It illumines a limited portion of the path, throwing light\r\nbefore and behind for some distance; but it has to be discarded and\r\nexchanged at intervals because it has become exhausted and because its\r\nwork is done.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a little surprising that the phenomenon of electrical repulsion\r\nshould have escaped the attention of one so skilled in experimentation\r\nas Gilbert. Yet such was the case; and Gilbert even went so far as to\r\ndeny its very existence, saying, \"Electrics attract objects of every\r\nkind; they never repel.\" This error reminds one of Gilbert's own saying\r\nthat \"Men of acute intelligence, without actual knowledge of facts, and\r\nin the absence of experiment, easily slip and err.\" Just twenty-nine\r\nyears after Gilbert had penned this aphorism, there appeared in Ferrara\r\nan extensive work on electric and magnetic philosophy, by the Jesuit\r\nCabeo, in which this electrical repulsion was recognized and described.\r\nHaving rubbed one of his electrics, Cabeo noticed that it attracted\r\ngrains of dust at first and afterward repelled them suddenly and\r\nviolently. In the case of threads, hairs or filaments of any kind, he\r\nobserved that they quivered a little before being flung away like\r\nsawdust. This self-repelling property of electricity, described in the\r\nyear 1629, opened up a new field of inquiry, which was actively explored\r\nby a number of brilliant electricians in England and on the Continent.\r\n\r\nThis was especially the case after the building of the first frictional\r\nmachine by Otto von Guericke in 1672. The burgomaster of Magdeburg had\r\nalready acquired European fame by the original and sensational\r\nexperiments on atmospheric pressure which he made in presence of the\r\nEmperor and his nobles in solemn diet assembled (1651). Von Guericke\r\nseems to have been of a mind with Gilbert concerning writers on natural\r\nscience who treat their subjects \"esoterically, miracle-mongeringly,\r\nabstrusely, reconditely, mystically\"; for he affirms that \"oratory,\r\nelegance of diction or skill in disputation avails nothing in the field\r\nof natural science.\"\r\n\r\nVon Guericke's machine consisted of a ball of sulphur, with the hand of\r\nthe operator or assistant as rubber. Some years later, the sulphur ball\r\nwas replaced by Newton (some say Hauksbee) by a glass globe, which, in\r\nturn, was exchanged for a glass cylinder by Gordon, a Scotch\r\nBenedictine, who was Professor of natural philosophy in the University\r\nof Erfurt. In 1755, Martin de Planta, of Sus, in Switzerland,\r\nconstructed a plate-machine which was subsequently improved by Ramsden\r\nof London. The frictional machine, as it was rightly called, has been\r\nsuperseded by the influence machine, a type of static generator which is\r\nat once efficient, reliable and easy of operation. The best known form\r\nfor laboratory use is that of Wimshurst (1832-1903), of London.\r\n\r\nAndrew Gordon, the Scotch Benedictine to whom reference has just been\r\nmade, was a man of an inventive turn of mind. Besides, the cylindrical\r\nelectric machine which he constructed, he devised several ingenious\r\npieces of electrical apparatus, among which are the _electric chimes_\r\nusually ascribed to Franklin. They are fully described in his _Versuch\r\neiner Erklärung der Electricität_, published in 1745. On page 38, he\r\nsays that he was led to try an electrical method of ringing bells; and\r\nthen adds: \"For this purpose I placed two small wine-glasses near each\r\nother, one of which stood on an electrified board, while the other,\r\nplaced at a distance of an inch from it, was connected with the ground.\r\nBetween the two, I suspended a little clapper by a silk thread, which\r\nclapper was attracted by the electrified glass and then repelled to the\r\ngrounded one, giving rise to a sound as it struck each glass. As the\r\nclapper adhered somewhat to the glasses, the effect on the whole was not\r\nagreeable. I, therefore, substituted two small metallic gongs suspended\r\none from an electrified conductor and the other from a grounded rod, the\r\ngongs being on the same level and one inch apart. When the clapper was\r\nlowered and adjusted, it moved at once to the electrified bell, from\r\nwhich it was driven over to the other, and kept on moving to and fro,\r\nstriking the bell each time with pleasing effect until the electrified\r\nbell lost its charge.\" In the illustration, _a_ is connected with the\r\nelectrified conductor; _b_ is the insulated clapper; _c_ the grounded\r\ngong.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10 Gordon's electric chimes, 1745]\r\n\r\nGordon's book was published in Erfurt in 1745, while the year 1752 is\r\nthat in which Franklin applied the chimes to his experimental rod to\r\napprise him of the approach of an electric storm, an application which\r\nwas original and quite in keeping with the practical turn of mind that\r\ncharacterized our journeyman-printer, philosopher and statesman.\r\nUnquestionably, Franklin had all the ingenuity and constructive ability\r\nneeded to make such an appliance; but there is no evidence that he\r\nactually invented it. Though Franklin neither claimed nor disclaimed the\r\nchimes as his own, all his admirers would have preferred less reticence\r\non his part when the discoveries and inventions of contemporary workers\r\nin the electrical field were concerned. He had attained sufficient\r\neminence to permit him to look appreciatingly and encouragingly on the\r\nefforts of others.\r\n\r\nGordon also invented a toy electric motor in which rotation was effected\r\nby the reaction of electrified air-particles escaping from a number of\r\nsharp points. One of these motors consisted of a star of light rays cut\r\nfrom a sheet of tin and pivoted at the center, with the ends of the rays\r\nslightly bent aside and all in the same direction. When electrified,\r\nGordon noticed that the star required no extraneous help to set it in\r\nmotion. It was a self-starting electric-motor. In the dark, the points\r\nwere tipped with light, and as they revolved traced out a luminous\r\ncircle which \"could neither be blown out nor decreased.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will recognize in this description taken from Gordon's\r\n_Versuch_, page 45, the _electric whirl_ of the lecture-table; Gordon's\r\nname is never associated with it, but that of Hamilton (Hamilton's \"fly\"\r\nor Hamilton's \"mill\") sometimes is!\r\n\r\nThis irrepressible monk seems to have been one of the earliest\r\nelectrocutors, for it is said that many an innocent chaffinch fell\r\nvictim to discharges from his machine; and we would be disposed to think\r\nof him as a wizard on learning that he ignited spirits by using an\r\nelectrified stream of water, to the astonishment and mystification of\r\nthe spectators.\r\n\r\nAbbé Menon was kinder to the feathered tribe than his black-cowled\r\nbrother of Erfurt; he did not subject them to a powerful discharge, but\r\nrather to a gentle electrification for the purpose of determining what\r\nphysical or physiological effect the agent would have on the animal\r\nsystem. The Abbé found that cats, pigeons, sparrows and chaffinches lost\r\nweight by being electrified for five or six hours at a time, from which\r\nhe concluded that electricity augments the slow, continuous perspiration\r\nof animals. The same was found to take place with the human body itself.\r\nThe reader will remember that Stephen Gray in 1730 suspended a boy by\r\nmeans of silken cords for the purpose of electrification; Abbé Nollet\r\ndid the same, and doubtless his friend Abbé Menon adopted a similar mode\r\nof insulation for complacent electrical subjects. An easier mode of\r\noperating would have been to make the child stand on a cake of resin,\r\nthe insulating property of which had been discovered by Stephen Gray.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, 1746, Franklin appears on the scene, and though he\r\ndevoted but nine years (1746-1755) of his life to the study of\r\nelectricity, he made discoveries in that fascinating branch of human\r\nknowledge that will hand his name down the centuries.\r\n\r\nFranklin's life is interesting and instructive on account of the\r\ndifficulties which he met and overcame, for his strength of will,\r\ntenacity of purpose, the philosophy which he followed, his devotedness\r\nto science, and the success which he achieved.\r\n\r\nOur philosopher's moral code comprised the thirteen virtues of\r\ntemperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity,\r\njustice, moderation, cleanliness, tranquility, chastity and humility. To\r\neach of these virtues Franklin attached a precept which makes edifying\r\nreading even at the present day: _temperance_, eat not to dullness,\r\ndrink not to elation; _silence_, speak not but what may benefit others\r\nor yourself, avoid trifling conversation; _order_, let all your things\r\nhave their places, let each part of your business have its time;\r\n_resolution_, resolve to perform what you ought, perform without fail\r\nwhat you resolve; _frugality_, make no expense, but do good to others or\r\nyourself, _i.e._, waste nothing; _industry_, lose no time, be always\r\nemployed in something useful, cut off all unnecessary actions;\r\n_sincerity_, use no hurtful deceit, think innocently and justly, and if\r\nyou speak, speak accordingly; _justice_, wrong no one by doing injury or\r\nomitting the benefits that are your duty; _moderation_, avoid extremes,\r\nforbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve;\r\n_cleanliness_, tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes or habitation;\r\n_tranquility_, be not disturbed by trifles or accidents common or\r\nunavoidable; _chastity_ (no remark); _humility_, imitate Jesus.\r\n\r\nThis last virtue seems to have given Franklin very much concern; for he\r\nadmits that he had the appearance of humility, and immediately adds that\r\nin reality there is no passion of the human breast so hard to subdue as\r\npride. He is shrewd enough to say that \"even if I could conceive that I\r\nhad completely overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\"\r\nLike many another, the virtue which gave him the most trouble was\r\n_order_, and this never became conspicuously apparent at any time of his\r\nlong life.\r\n\r\nIn his endeavors after the higher life, he seems to have been animated\r\nwith the earnest spirit of the ascetic who binds himself to strive after\r\nperfection as laid down in the maxims and counsels of the Gospel. It is\r\nnot without surprise and perhaps a feeling too of self-condemnation,\r\nthat we read the means which he adopted to reach a high moral standard.\r\nTaking for granted that he had a true appreciation of right and wrong,\r\nhe did not see why he should not always act according to the dictates of\r\nconscience. To improve himself morally and advance in the higher life,\r\nhe adopted a means that should have proved effective. Taking the first\r\nof the thirteen fundamental virtues, he applied himself to its\r\nacquisition for a whole week together, after which he took the second,\r\nthen the third, and so on with the rest. He thought that by making daily\r\nacts of the virtue, it would become habitual with him at the end of the\r\nweek. When the last of the thirteen virtues had received its share of\r\nattention, he returned to the first one on the list and proceeded round\r\nthe cycle again. Being a man of purpose and tenacity, he completed the\r\ncircle of his chosen virtues four times a year; subsequently he extended\r\nthe time of individual practise so as to take a whole year for the\r\ncourse; and later on, he devoted several years to the completion of his\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nAs an aid in this work of self-betterment, Franklin examined himself\r\ndaily, registering his failures in a little book which was ruled for\r\nthe purpose, a column being allowed for each day and a line for each of\r\nthe thirteen virtues. He naively tells us the result of this exercise of\r\ndaily introspection in these words: \"I am surprised to find myself so\r\nmuch fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing them diminish.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening examination of conscience was always concluded by the\r\nfollowing prayer written by Franklin himself: \"O powerful Goodness!\r\nbountiful Father! merciful Guide! increase in me that wisdom which\r\ndiscovers my truest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what\r\nthat wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to Thy other children as\r\nthe only return in my power for Thy continual favors to me.\"\r\n\r\nAn extensive reader, Franklin found in Thomson's poems some lines that\r\nappealed to him very strongly by the beauty of the sentiment expressed.\r\nHe called them \"a little prayer,\" which he recited from time to time:\r\n\r\n    \"Father of light and life, Thou Lord Supreme,\r\n    Oh, teach me what is good; teach me Thyself.\r\n    Save me from folly, vanity and vice;\r\n    From every low pursuit; and fill my soul\r\n    With knowledge, conscious peace and virtue pure;\r\n    Sacred, substantial, never-failing bliss!\"\r\n\r\nHis was a praiseworthy attempt at emancipating himself from the thraldom\r\nof passion and raising himself to the high plane of perfection required\r\nby the Master when He said \"Follow Me.\" Doubtless, as time wore on, he\r\nmust have felt as many before and since, that the spirit is willing but\r\nthe flesh is weak.\r\n\r\nIn his autobiography, Franklin attributes his success in business not\r\nonly to his self-control, uniformity of conduct, philosophical\r\nindifference to slight or pique, but also to his habits of frugality,\r\nthe result in part of his early training. \"My original habits of\r\nfrugality continuing,\" he says, \"and my father having frequently\r\nrepeated a proverb of Solomon, 'Seest thou a man diligent in his\r\nbusiness? he shall stand before kings,' I from thence considered\r\nindustry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which\r\nencouraged me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally _stand\r\nbefore kings_, which, however, has since happened.\" Our aged philosopher\r\nproceeds to tell us of his good fortune with a little bit of pardonable\r\nvanity, to which, by the way, he was never a great stranger, despite his\r\nphilosophy, acquired virtue, and staid character. Referring to the kings\r\nof the earth, he informs us that he \"_stood_ before five, and even had\r\nthe honor of _sitting down_ with one to dinner.\"\r\n\r\nAn important event in Franklin's life was the founding by him of the\r\nfirst public library in the country in the year 1732. Though but\r\ntwenty-six years of age, he seems to have been as well aware as any of\r\nthe millionaire philanthropists of to-day, of the good that may be\r\naccomplished among common people by providing them with suitable reading\r\nmatter. He watched with eagerness the progress of his experiment and was\r\npleased with the success that crowned it. He observes that such\r\nlibraries \"tend to improve the conversation of Americans and to make\r\ncommon tradesmen and farmers as intelligent (well-informed?) as most\r\ngentlemen from other countries.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of London, who had\r\ndealings with some Philadelphia merchants, was led to take an active\r\ninterest in the library. This he did by sending over a number of books\r\nand papers relating to electricity together with an \"electrical tube\"\r\nwith instructions for its use.\r\n\r\nThese literary and scientific contributions sent from London from time\r\nto time, excited much interest among the charter members of the Library\r\nCompany, and principally that of Franklin himself. He had heard\r\nsomething of the new order of phenomena which was just then engaging the\r\nattention of European physicists. In the summer of 1746, while on a\r\nvisit to Boston, his native place, he assisted at a lecture on\r\nelectricity by a certain Dr. Spence, a Scotchman, who sought to\r\nillustrate the properties of electrified bodies by such experiments as\r\ncould be made with glass tubes and suitable rubbers, the rudimentary\r\napparatus available at the time. Franklin was impressed by what he saw\r\nand heard, even though he indulged in a little destructive criticism\r\nwhen he said that the experiments were \"imperfectly made,\" because the\r\nlecturer was \"not very expert.\" When Franklin wrote those words, he knew\r\nby repeated and painful experience the difficulty of getting\r\nsatisfactory results from rubbing glass tubes or rotating glass globes,\r\nowing to the provoking attraction which plain, untreated glass has for\r\nmoisture. Knowing this, he might have been less severe in his strictures\r\non his friend, the peripatetic electrician.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the experiments which he witnessed\r\nsurprised and pleased him, for, having shortly afterward received some\r\nelectrical tubes together with a paper of instructions, from his London\r\nfriend, Peter Collinson, he set to work for himself without delay. We\r\nmay well say of him that what his right hand found to do, he did\r\ncalmly, but with all his might. A twelve-month had not elapsed before he\r\nwrote: \"I never was engaged in any study that so totally engrossed my\r\nattention and time as this has lately done; for, what with making\r\nexperiments when I can be alone and repeating them to my friends and\r\nacquaintance who, from the novelty of the thing, come continually in\r\ncrowds to see them, I have had little leisure for anything else.\"\r\n(1747.)\r\n\r\nHere we see the calm, persistent character of the philosopher united\r\nwith the affability and communicativeness of the gentleman.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of encouraging others as well, perhaps, as through a sense\r\nof personal relief, Franklin had a number of long tubes of large bore\r\nblown at the local glass-house, which tubes he distributed to his\r\nfriends that they, too, might engage in research work. In this way,\r\nrubbing and rubbing of an energetic kind became quite an occupation in\r\nthe Franklin circle. Kinnersley, whose name still survives in works on\r\nstatic electricity in connection with an electric \"thermometer\" which he\r\ndevised, was among the band of ardent workers who ungrudgingly\r\nacknowledged Franklin's superior acumen, comprehensive grasp of detail\r\nand wondrous insight into the mechanism of the new phenomena. If we say\r\nthat Franklin was not a genius, it is only for the purpose of adding\r\nthat even in those early electrical studies he displayed an uncommon\r\namount of the unlimited capacity for taking pains which is said to be\r\nassociated with that brilliant gift. He tested all his results with\r\ngreat care and in a variety of ways before accepting any of them as\r\nfinal; and considered his explanations of them provisional, being ever\r\nready to modify them or give them up altogether if shown to conflict\r\nwith the simple workings of nature.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1733, the refined and tactful Dufay, in France, showed by\r\nnumerous experiments on woods, stones, books, oranges and metals that\r\nall solid bodies were susceptible of electrification. This was a notable\r\nadvance which swept away Gilbert's classification of bodies into\r\nelectrics and non-electrics. The French physicist soon drew from his\r\nobservations the conclusion that electrification produced by friction is\r\nof two kinds, to which he applied the terms vitreous and resinous, the\r\nformer being developed when glass is rubbed with silk and the latter\r\nwhen amber or common sealing-wax is rubbed with flannel. He noticed,\r\ntoo, that silk strings repelled each other when both were touched either\r\nwith excited glass or sealing-wax; but that they attracted each other\r\nwhen touched one with glass and the other with sealing-wax. From these\r\nobservations, he deduced the electrostatic laws, that similarly\r\nelectrified bodies attract while dissimilarly electrified bodies repel\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe law of distance was discovered later by Coulomb, who, in 1785,\r\nshowed that the law of repulsion as well as of attraction between two\r\nelectrified particles varies inversely as the square of the distance. In\r\nthe year 1750, the law of the inverse square for magnets was stated by\r\nJohn Michell, who expressed it by saying that the \"attraction and\r\nrepulsion decrease as the square of the distance from the respective\r\npoles increases.\" Michell was fourth wrangler of his year (1748-9),\r\nFellow of Queen's College, Cambridge, and inventor of the _torsion\r\nbalance_, which, however, he did not live to use; but which, in the\r\nhands of Cavendish, yielded important results on the mean density of\r\nthe earth. Coulomb probably re-invented the \"balance\" and applied the\r\npractical, laboratory instrument which he made it, to the study of the\r\nquantitative laws of electricity and magnetism.\r\n\r\nTo observe and correlate phenomena is the special work of the physicist;\r\nto speculate on ultimate causes is the privilege of the philosopher.\r\nDufay was both. The theory which he offered was a simple one, even if\r\nuntrue to nature. It was a good working hypothesis for the time being.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, there are two distinct, independent electrical\r\nfluids mutually attractive but self-repelling. With that postulate,\r\nDufay was able to offer a plausible explanation of a great many\r\nphenomena that puzzled the electricians of the time.\r\n\r\nFranklin, however, held a different view; rejecting the dual nature of\r\nelectricity, he propounded his one-fluid theory, which was found equally\r\ncapable of explaining electrical phenomena. A body having an excess of\r\nthe fluid was said to be _positively_ charged, while one with a deficit\r\nwas said to be _negatively_ charged. The sign plus was used in one case\r\nand the sign minus in the other; and just as two algebraical quantities\r\nof equal magnitude but opposite sign give zero when added together, so a\r\nconductor to which equal quantities of positive and negative electricity\r\nwould be given would be in the neutral state. The Franklinian theory was\r\nwelcomed in England, Germany and Italy, but it met with opposition in\r\nFrance from the brilliant Abbé Nollet and the followers of Dufay.\r\n\r\nEach of the rival theories affords a mental conception of the forces in\r\nplay and also a consistent explanation of the resulting phenomena. Their\r\nsimplicity, and, at the same time, the comprehensiveness of explanation\r\nwhich they afford, will continue to give them a place in our text-books\r\nfor many years to come.\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made to apply the _electronic_ theory to the various\r\nphenomena of electrostatics, the electron being the smallest particle of\r\nelectricity that can have separate, individual existence. It is many\r\ntimes smaller than the hydrogen atom, the smallest of chemical atoms,\r\nand it possesses all the properties of negative electricity. By the loss\r\nof one or more electrons, a body becomes positively electrified, whereas\r\nby the acquisition of one or more electrons it becomes negatively\r\nelectrified. The electron at rest gives rise to the phenomena of\r\nelectrostatics; in motion, it gives rise to electrical currents,\r\nelectromagnetism and electric radiation.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what led Franklin to call positive the electrification of\r\nglass when rubbed with silk, and negative that of sealing-wax when\r\nrubbed with flannel. If he meant to imply that positive is the more\r\nimportant of the two, he erred, for many reasons can be given to show\r\nthe preponderating influence of negative electricity; but it is too late\r\nnow to change the terminology.\r\n\r\nIf asked to point out differences between the physical effects of\r\npositive and negative electrification, we would refer to the positive\r\nbrush, which is finer and much more developed than the negative; to the\r\nWimshurst machine, with its positive brushes on one side and negative\r\n\"beads\" on the other; to the positive charge acquired by a clean plate\r\nof zinc when exposed to ultraviolet light; to the ordinary vacuum tube\r\nin which there is a violet glow at the cathode end or negative terminal;\r\nto Crookes's tubes, X-ray tubes and other high vacuum tubes, in which\r\nelectrified particles, Kelvin's _molecular torrent_, are shot out from\r\nthe negative electrode with great velocity; and to arc-lamps using a\r\ndirect current in which the plus carbon is hollowed out crater-like, has\r\nthe higher temperature and wastes away twice as fast as the negative.\r\n\r\nThe year 1746 is an _annus mirabilis_ in the history of electricity, for\r\nit was in the January of that year that an attempt to electrify water by\r\nMusschenbroek, of Leyden, led to the discovery of the principle of the\r\nelectrostatic condenser. Whatever may be thought of the claim for\r\npriority put forward in favor of Dean von Kleist, of Cammin in\r\nPomerania, or of Cunæus, of Leyden, it is certain that the discovery\r\nbecame known throughout Europe by the startling announcement and\r\nsensational description given of it by Musschenbroek, a renowned\r\nprofessor of a renowned university. He was not only surprised but\r\nterror-stricken by the effect of the electric energy which he had\r\nunconsciously stored up in his little phial; for after telling his\r\nFrench friend Réaumur, the physicist, that he felt the commotion in his\r\narms, shoulders and chest, he added that he would not take another shock\r\nfor the whole kingdom of France! A resolution destined to be broken,\r\nlike so many others before and since.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11 Modern form of Leyden jar with movable coatings]\r\n\r\nVery different was the sentiment of Bose, Professor of Physics in the\r\nUniversity of Wittenberg, who is credited with saying that he would like\r\nto die by the electric shock, that he might live in the memoirs of the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nThe Leyden jar became at once the scientific curiosity and universal\r\ntopic of discussion of the time; and not only was it the curiosity, but\r\nalso the _crux_ of the day, puzzling investigators, perplexing\r\nphilosophers and giving rise to animated controversies. The mystery was\r\nsoon dispelled, however, when Franklin began in 1747 his searching\r\ninquiry into the electric conditions of each element of the jar. Nothing\r\nescaped his subtle mind and nothing was left undone by his deft hand.\r\nThe evidence of experiment and the logic of facts carried at last\r\nconviction even with Londoners and Parisians, who were wont to look upon\r\nAmericans as mere colonists, who had neither time nor opportunity for\r\nscientific pursuits, being obliged to hew their way through virgin\r\nforests or drive the roving Indian back from their frontiers into the\r\nwilds of the West. The theory of the Leyden jar given by Franklin 160\r\nyears ago has stood the test of time. It has met with universal\r\nacceptance; and, despite our manifold advances, but little of permanent\r\nvalue has been added to it.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to follow the main lines of this magnificent\r\nresearch. Franklin electrifies, in the usual way, water contained in a\r\nsmall flask, complaisantly taking the shock on completing the circuit.\r\nTo find where the charge resides, whether in the hand of the operator,\r\nas some said, or in the water, as others maintained, he again\r\nelectrifies the water and pours it into another flask, which fails,\r\nhowever, to give a shock, thus showing that the charge had not been\r\ncarried over with the water. Convinced that the charge was still\r\nsomewhere in the first phial, he carefully poured water into it again;\r\nand found, to his intense satisfaction, that it was capable of giving an\r\nexcellent shock. It was now clear to him that the energy of the charge\r\nwas either in the hand of the experimenter or in the glass itself, or in\r\nboth. To determine this nice point, he proceeds to construct a \"jar\"\r\nwhich could easily be taken to pieces. For this purpose, he selected a\r\npane of glass; and, laying it on the extended hand, placed a sheet of\r\nlead on its upper surface. The leaden plate was then electrified; and\r\nwhen touched with the finger, a spark was seen and a shock felt. By the\r\naddition of another plate to the lower surface, the shocking power of\r\nthis simple condenser was increased. In this efficient form he had a\r\nreadily dissectible condenser, which allowed him to throw off and\r\nreplace the coatings at will, and thereby to prove beyond cavil that the\r\nseat of the stored-up electric energy is not in the conductors, but in\r\nthe glass itself. This was a discovery of the first magnitude and one\r\ndestined to associate the name of Franklin with those of the most\r\neminent electricians down the ages. Fig. 11 shows the modern form of the\r\njar with movable coatings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12 Three coated panes in _series_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13 Three panes in _parallel_]\r\n\r\nIn the \"fulminating\" pane, as it came to be called, we have one of the\r\neleven elements of Franklin's historic battery of 1748. It is\r\ninteresting to notice that he was accustomed to connect his \"panes\" in\r\nseries while charging (Fig. 12), but that he preferred to join similar\r\ncoatings together, that is, to couple them in \"parallel\" (Fig. 13), for\r\npowerful discharges. Fig. 14 shows three jars in \"parallel.\"\r\n\r\nLater on, he arranged Leyden jars so that the inside coating of one\r\ncould be hooked to the outside coating of another, the first of the\r\nseries hanging down from the prime conductor of the machine, while the\r\nlast one was grounded. \"What is driven out of the tail of the first,\" he\r\nquaintly says, \"serves to charge the second; what is driven out of the\r\nsecond serves to charge the third, and so on.\" This has become known as\r\nthe \"cascade\" method of charging a battery, owing to the flow of\r\nelectricity from one jar to the next (Fig. 15). Electricians, however,\r\nhave discarded the picturesque \"cascade\" for the prosaic term of\r\n\"series\" or \"tandem\" arrangement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14 Three jars in _parallel_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15 Three jars in _cascade_]\r\n\r\nFranklin also noticed that a phial cannot be charged while standing on\r\nwax or on glass, or even while hanging from the prime conductor, unless\r\ncommunication be formed between its outer coating and the floor, the\r\nreason given being that \"the jar will not suffer a charging unless as\r\nmuch fire can go out of it one way as is thrown in by the other.\"\r\n(1748.)\r\n\r\nFollowing his very ingenious Philadelphia friend and co-worker,\r\nKinnersley, he varies the mode of charging by electrifying the outside\r\nof the jar and grounding the inner coating; for \"the phial will be\r\nelectrified as strongly if held by the hook and the coating applied to\r\nthe globe as when held by the coating and the hook applied to the\r\nglobe.\" (1748.)\r\n\r\nThe globe here referred to is the glass globe of Franklin's frictional\r\nmachine of American make, which, when rotated, was electrified\r\npositively by contact with the hand or with a leather rubber. Franklin\r\nalso used a sulphur ball or \"brimstone\" globe, and observed that the\r\nelectrification produced on it differed in kind from that developed on\r\nthe glass globe. (1752.)\r\n\r\nIt may here be stated that the first to use a _leather cushion_ as a\r\nsubstitute for the hand in the frictional machine, was Winkler, of\r\nLeipzig (1745); the efficiency of the rubber was increased by Canton, of\r\nLondon, who covered it with an _amalgam_ of tin and mercury (1762).\r\nBose, of Wittenberg, had previously added the _prime-conductor_, which\r\ngreatly augmented the electrical capacity and output of the machine.\r\n\r\nIn 1750 Franklin imitated the effect of lightning on the compasses of a\r\nship by the action of a jar discharge on an unmagnetized steel needle.\r\n\"By electricity,\" he says, \"we have frequently given polarity to needles\r\nand reversed it at pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar experiments are made to-day in every lecture-course on static\r\nelectricity; but the experimenter, when wise, does not announce\r\nbeforehand which end of the needle will be north and which south, as he\r\nis just as likely to be wrong as right, the uncertainty being due to the\r\nfact that the discharge of a Leyden jar is not a current of electricity\r\nin one direction, but rather a few sudden rushes or rapid surgings of\r\nelectricity to and fro; in other words, it is oscillatory in character\r\ninstead of being continuous in one direction.\r\n\r\nFranklin did not know this; although he made a very pertinent remark in\r\n1749 when he likened the mechanical condition of the glass of a charged\r\njar to that of a bent rod or a stretched spring. \"So, a straight\r\nspring,\" he says, \"when forcibly bent must, to restore itself, contract\r\nthat side which in the bending was extended, and extend that side which\r\nwas contracted.\" Franklin knew, of course, that the bent rod, when\r\nreleased, would swing to and fro a few times before settling down to its\r\nstate of rest; but he failed to see the analogy between it and the\r\nstrained glass of the charged Leyden jar.\r\n\r\nIt is to Joseph Henry (1799-1878), the Faraday of America, that we owe\r\nthe recognition and statement of the oscillatory character of the\r\ndischarge from Leyden jars and condensers generally. He discovered and\r\npublished this cardinal fact in 1842. His words deserve recording. \"The\r\ndischarge, whatever may be its nature, is not correctly represented\r\n(employing for simplicity the theory of Franklin) by the single transfer\r\nof an imponderable fluid from one side of the jar to the other; the\r\nphenomenon requires us to admit _the existence of a principal discharge\r\nin one direction and then several reflex actions backward and forward,\r\neach more feeble than the preceding, until equilibrium is\r\nattained._\"[10] The italics are Prof. Henry's.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this oscillatory character of the spark-discharge that\r\nenables us to send out trains of electric waves into the all-pervading\r\nether, and thus to communicate, by \"wireless,\" with remote stations.\r\n\r\nHaving conclusively proved that the energy of a charged condenser\r\nresides in the dielectric, Franklin next tries to find whether \"the\r\nelectric matter\" in the case of conductors is limited to the surface or\r\nwhether it penetrates to an appreciable depth. To ascertain this, he\r\ninsulates a silver fruit-can and brings a charged ball, held by a silk\r\nthread, into contact with the outer surface. On testing after removal,\r\nhe found that the ball retained some of its charge, whilst it lost all\r\nif allowed to touch the bottom of the vessel. Surprised at this\r\nunexpected difference, he repeated the experiment again and again, only\r\nto find the ball every time without a trace of charge after contact with\r\nthe interior of the vessel. This perplexed and puzzled him. \"The fact is\r\nsingular,\" he says, \"and you require the reason? I do not know it. I\r\nfind a frank acknowledgment of one's ignorance is not only the easiest\r\nway to get rid of a difficulty, but the likeliest way to obtain\r\ninformation, and therefore I practice it. I think it an honest policy.\r\nThose who affect to be thought to know everything, often remain long\r\nignorant of many things that others could and would instruct them in, if\r\nthey appeared less conceited.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1755. Cavendish in 1773 and Coulomb in 1788 independently\r\nattacked the same problem; and having proved by their classic\r\nexperiments that a static charge is limited to the surface of\r\nconductors, it was but a step to infer that such a distribution of\r\nelectricity implies that the law of force between two elements of\r\ncharge, or between two point-charges, is the law of the inverse square\r\nof the distance.\r\n\r\nIt will also be remembered that Faraday, not knowing what had been\r\naccomplished eighty years before in Philadelphia, used for one of his\r\nbest-known experiments an ice-pail, into which he lowered an electrified\r\nball for the purpose of showing the exact equality of the induced and\r\nthe inducing charge. The similarity of apparatus and mode of procedure\r\nare remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing his work, Franklin placed a charged jar on a cake of wax and\r\nother insulating materials, and drew sparks from it by touching\r\nsuccessively the knob and the outer coating, repeating the process a\r\ngreat number of times to his infinite delight. He next attached a brass\r\nrod to the outside, bending it and bringing the other end close to the\r\nknob (Fig. 16) connected with the inner coating. Between these two he\r\nsuspended a leaden ball by a silk thread and found, as he expected, that\r\nit played to and fro between the terminals for a considerable time.\r\nObserve that we have here a definite mass maintained in a state of\r\nreciprocating motion by a series of electric attractions and repulsions.\r\nWe have in fact an electro-motor, closely resembling the star and the\r\nchimes of Gordon, the Benedictine, 1745; a mere toy, if you will, but\r\nstill a remarkable invention. We repeat the same experiment to-day only\r\nwith a little more harmony, by substituting for the knobs two little\r\nbells, which emit a soft, musical note when struck by the interhanging\r\nclapper.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16 Discharge by alternate contacts]\r\n\r\nThis experiment has further significance, for, like Gordon's chimes, it\r\nis an instance of the conveyance of electricity from one point of space\r\nto another by means of a material carrier, a mode of transfer which has\r\nsince been called \"electric convection,\" the full meaning of which was\r\nnot revealed until Rowland (1848-1901), made his famous experiment of\r\n1876 in the laboratory of the University of Berlin with a\r\nhighly-charged, rapidly-revolving, ebonite disc. It was apropos of this\r\nexperiment that the illustrious Clerk Maxwell, of the University of\r\nCambridge, wrote to his friend, Professor Tait, of Edinburgh, saying\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n    \"The mounted disc of ebonite\r\n       Had whirled before, but whirled in vain;\r\n     Rowland of Troy, that doughty knight,\r\n       Convection currents did obtain,\r\n     In such a disc, of power to wheedle\r\n     From its loved north, the needle.\"\r\n\r\nWe may here say that Franklin was no stranger to the work done by the\r\nelectrical pioneers of the Old World, his diligent London friend, Peter\r\nCollinson, keeping him advised by means of letters, books and pamphlets,\r\nin which inspiration and practical hints must have been found. He\r\ncertainly was well acquainted with the achievements of Dr. Watson and\r\nDr. Bevis, of London, as well as with the theories and experiments of\r\nDufay and Abbé Nollet in Paris. It is germane to the subject to say that\r\nDr. Bevis used mercury and iron filings for the inner coating of his\r\njars, as well as sheet lead for both. He also experimented with coated\r\npanes of glass instead of jars. About this, Franklin wrote to Collinson:\r\n\"I perceive by the ingenious Mr. Watson's last book, lately received,\r\nthat Dr. Bevis had used, before we had, panes of glass to give a shock;\r\nthough till that book came to hand, I thought to have communicated it to\r\nyou as a novelty.\" (1748.)\r\n\r\nFranklin gave way to a little pleasant humor when, in 1748, he proposed\r\nto wind up the \"electrical season\" by a banquet à la Lucullus, to be\r\ngiven to a few of his friends and fellow-workers, not in a sumptuously\r\ndecorated hall, but _al fresco_, on the banks of the Schuylkill. \"A\r\nturkey is to be killed for our dinner by the electrical shock,\" he\r\nwrote, \"and roasted by the electrical jack before a fire kindled by the\r\nelectrical bottle, when the healths of all the famous electricians in\r\nEngland, Holland, France and Germany are to be drunk in electrified\r\nbumpers under the discharge of guns fired from the electrical battery.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be supposed that such an elaborate program was carried\r\nout. Indeed the difficulty of preparing the apparatus and getting it\r\nready for action on the banks of a river were formidable enough to say\r\nthe least. Franklin, however, had a Leyden battery capable of doing\r\nconsiderable electrocution, for with two jars of six gallons capacity\r\neach, he knocked six men to the ground; the same two jars sufficed to\r\nkill a hen outright, whereas it required five, he tells us, to kill a\r\nturkey weighing ten pounds.\r\n\r\nThe \"electrical bumper\" was a wine-glass containing an allowance, let us\r\nsay, of some favorite brand and charged in the usual way. On approaching\r\nthe lips the two coatings would be brought within striking-distance and\r\na spark would take place, if not to the delight of the performer, at\r\nleast to the amusement of the on-lookers. It was subsequently remarked\r\nthat guests whose upper lip was adorned with a moustache could quaff the\r\nnectar with impunity, as every bristle would play the part of a filiform\r\nlightning-rod and prevent the apprehended, disruptive discharge!\r\n\r\nNot quite so humorous was his suggestion of a hammock to be used by\r\ntimid people during an electric storm: \"A hammock or swinging-bed,\r\nsuspended by silk cords equally distant from the walls on every side,\r\nand from the ceiling and floor above and below, affords the safest\r\nsituation a person can have in any room whatever; and which, indeed, may\r\nbe deemed quite free from danger of any stroke of lightning.\" (1767.)\r\n\r\nIn his experiments on puncturing bodies by the spark-discharge, Franklin\r\ndoes not fail to notice the double burr produced when paper is used.[9]\r\nHis words are:\r\n\r\n\"When a hole is struck through pasteboard by the electrified jar, if the\r\nsurfaces of the pasteboard are not confined or compressed, there will be\r\na bur raised all round the hole on both sides the pasteboard, for the\r\nbur round the outside of the hole is the effect of the explosion every\r\nway from the centre of the stream and not an effect of direction.\"\r\n(1753.) The spelling is Franklin's _unreformed_.\r\n\r\nThe to-and-fro nature of the discharge was thought, at a time, to\r\naccount satisfactorily for the burr raised on each side of the\r\npasteboard; but Trowbridge, of Harvard, has shown that even a\r\nunidirectional discharge, such as can be obtained by inserting a wet\r\nstring or any high resistance in the circuit, would produce a double\r\nburr, from which we infer, confirming Franklin, that this effect of the\r\ndischarge is caused by the sudden expansion of air within the paper\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1749, Franklin had reached the conclusion that the lightning\r\nof the skies is identical with that of our laboratories, basing his\r\nbelief on the following analogies which he enumerates in the notes or\r\n\"minutes\" which he kept of his experiments: \"The electric fluid agrees\r\nwith lightning in these particulars: (1) Giving light; (2) color of the\r\nlight; (3) crooked direction; (4) swift motion; (5) being conducted by\r\nmetals; (6) crack or noise in exploding; (7) rending bodies it passes\r\nthrough; (8) destroying animals; (9) melting metals; (10) firing\r\ninflammable substances; and (11) sulphurous smell.\"\r\n\r\nBut although he felt the full force of the analogical argument, Franklin\r\nknew that the matter could not be finally settled without an appeal to\r\nexperiment; and accordingly he adds: \"The electric fluid is attracted by\r\npoints; we do not know whether this property is in lightning. But since\r\nthey agree in all the particulars wherein we can already compare them,\r\nis it not probable that they agree likewise in this? Let the experiment\r\nbe made.\" (1749.)\r\n\r\nIn writing to Collinson in July, 1750, he tells his London friend how\r\nthe experiment may be made: \"On the top of some high tower or steeple,\r\nplace a kind of sentry-box--big enough to contain a man--and an\r\nelectrical stand. From the middle of the stand let an iron rod rise and\r\npass, bending out of the door, and then upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed\r\nvery sharp at the end. If the electrical stand be kept clean and dry, a\r\nman standing on it, when such clouds are passing low, might be\r\nelectrified and afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him from the\r\ncloud.\"\r\n\r\nCollinson brought some of Franklin's letters to the notice of\r\nfellow-members of the Royal Society with a view to their insertion in\r\nthe _Philosophical Transactions_ of that learned body; but even his\r\nepoch-making letter to Dr. Mitchell, of London, on the identity of\r\nlightning and electricity, was dismissed with derisive laughter. The\r\nRoyal Society made amends in due time for their contemptuous treatment\r\nof the American philosopher by electing him member of the Society and by\r\nawarding him the Copley medal in 1753.\r\n\r\nDisappointed as he was, Collinson collected Franklin's letters and\r\npublished them under the title of _New Experiments and Observations on\r\nElectricity made at Philadelphia in America_. The pamphlet appeared in\r\n1751, and was immediately translated into French by M. d'Alibard at the\r\nrequest of the great naturalist Count de Buffon.\r\n\r\nThe experiments described in the pamphlet, and especially that of the\r\npointed conductor, were taken up in Paris with great enthusiasm by de\r\nBuffon himself, by d'Alibard, a botanist of distinction, and by de Lor,\r\na professor of physics. Following out the instructions given by\r\nFranklin, they were all able to report success: d'Alibard on May 10th,\r\nde Lor on May 18th, and de Buffon on May 19th, 1752.\r\n\r\nDe Buffon erected his rod on the tower of his château at Montbar; de\r\nLor, over his house in Paris, and d'Alibard, at his country seat at\r\nMarly, a little town eighteen miles from Paris. D'Alibard was not at\r\nhome on the eventful afternoon of May 10th; but before leaving Marly, he\r\nhad drilled a certain Coiffier in what he should do in case an electric\r\nstorm came on during his absence. Though a hardy and resolute old\r\nsoldier and proud of the confidence placed in him, Coiffier grew alarmed\r\nat the long and noisy discharges which he drew from the _insulated_ rod\r\non the afternoon of May 10th. While the storm was still at its height he\r\nsent for the Prior of the place, Raulet by name, who hastened to the\r\nspot, followed by many of his parishioners. After witnessing a number of\r\nbrilliant and stunning discharges, the priest drew up an account of the\r\nincident and sent it, at once, by Coiffier himself to d'Alibard, who was\r\nthen in Paris. Without delay d'Alibard prepared a memoir on the subject\r\nwhich he communicated to the Académie des Sciences three days later,\r\nviz.: on May 13th. In the concluding paragraph, the polished academician\r\npays a graceful tribute to the philosopher of the Western World:\r\n\r\n\"It follows from all the experiments and observations contained in the\r\npresent paper, and more especially from the recent experiment at\r\nMarly-la-ville, that the matter of lightning is, beyond doubt, the same\r\nas that of electricity; it has become a reality, and I believe that the\r\nmore we realize what he (Franklin) has published on electricity, the\r\nmore will we acknowledge the great debt which physical science owes\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nWe may, in passing, correct the error of those who credit French\r\nphysicists with having originated the idea of the pointed conductor.\r\nSuch writers should read the words of d'Alibard in the beginning of his\r\nmemoir, where he says: \"En suivant la route que M. Franklin nous a\r\ntracée, j'ai obtenu une satisfaction complète\"; that is, \"In following\r\nthe way traced out by Franklin, I have met with complete success.\" To\r\nFranklin, therefore, belongs the idea of the pointed rod of 1750, which\r\nbecame the lightning conductor of subsequent years; to the Parisian\r\nsavants belongs the great distinction of having been the first to make\r\nthe experiment and verify the Franklinian view of the identity of the\r\nlightning of our skies with the electricity of our laboratories.\r\n\r\nFranklin had precise ideas on the action of his pointed conductors,\r\nclearly recognizing their twofold function: (1) that of preventing a\r\ndangerous rise of potential by disarming the cloud; and (2) that of\r\nconveying the discharge to earth, if struck. In some of his letters, he\r\ncomplains of people who concentrate their attention on the preventive\r\nfunction, forgetting the other entirely. \"Wherever my opinion is\r\nexamined in Europe,\" he wrote in 1755, \"nothing is considered but the\r\nprobability of these rods preventing a stroke, which is only a part of\r\nthe use I proposed for them; and the other part, their conducting a\r\nstroke which they may happen not to prevent, seems to be totally\r\nforgotten, though of equal importance and advantage.\"\r\n\r\nA favorite illustration of Franklin's showing the discharging power of\r\npoints, consisted in insulating a cannon ball against which rested a\r\npellet of cork, hung by a silk thread. On electrifying the ball, the\r\ncork flies off and remains suspended at a distance, falling back at\r\nonce, as soon as a needle is brought near the ball. (1747.)\r\n\r\nHe also used tassels consisting of fifteen or twenty long threads (Fig.\r\n17), and even cotton-fleece, the filaments of which stand out when\r\nelectrified, but come together when a pointed rod is held underneath. He\r\nalso noticed that the filaments do not collapse when the point of the\r\nrod is covered with a small ball. (1762.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17 Tassel of long threads or light strips of paper]\r\n\r\nFranklin's views on lightning-rods met with some opposition in France\r\nfrom the brilliant Abbé Nollet, and in England from Dr. Benjamin Wilson.\r\nThe latter was mainly instrumental in bringing about the famous\r\ncontroversy of \"Points _vs._ Knobs.\" In 1772, a committee was appointed\r\nby the Royal Society to consider the best means of protecting the\r\npowder-magazines at Purfleet from lightning. On the committee with Dr.\r\nWilson were Henry Cavendish, the distinguished chemist and physicist,\r\nand Sir John Pringle, President of the Royal Society. The report favored\r\nsharp conductors against blunt ones advocated by Dr. Wilson. Five years\r\nlater, in 1777, the question was again brought up, and again the new\r\ncommittee decided in favor of pointed terminals, convinced \"that the\r\nexperiments and reasons made and alleged to the contrary by Mr. Wilson\r\nwere inconclusive.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wilson, being a man of influence, succeeded in having his views\r\ntaken up by the Board of Ordnance. It has been remarked that this\r\ncontroversy would never have attracted attention but for the fact that\r\nthe discoverer of the effect of points was Franklin. He was an American\r\nand the dispute with the colonies was then at its height. The war of the\r\nRevolution had begun, and the British forces had already met with\r\nserious reverses. No patriot could, therefore, admit any good in points.\r\nGeorge III. took sides, decreed that the points on the royal conductors\r\nat Kew should be covered with balls, and ordered Sir John Pringle to\r\nsupport Dr. Wilson. Sir John gave the dignified answer: \"Sire, I cannot\r\nreverse the laws and operations of nature\"; to which the King, incensed\r\nthat so incompetent a man should hold such an important office, replied:\r\n\"Then, Sir John, perhaps you had better resign,\" which Sir John did.\r\n\r\nA wit of the time put the matter epigrammatically when he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"While you, great George, for knowledge hunt\r\n    And sharp conductors change to blunt,\r\n        The nation's out of joint;\r\n    Franklin a wiser course pursues,\r\n    And all your thunder useless views\r\n        By keeping to the point.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in connection with this heated controversy that Franklin wrote\r\nthe following admirable words:\r\n\r\n\"I have never entered into any controversy in defence of my\r\nphilosophical opinions. I leave them to take their chance in the world.\r\nIf they are _right_, truth and experience will support them; if _wrong_,\r\nthey ought to be refuted and rejected. The King's changing his _pointed_\r\nconductors for _blunt_ ones is, therefore, a matter of small importance\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until September, 1752, that Franklin raised a rod over his\r\nown house. This experimental conductor was made of iron fitted with a\r\nsharp steel point and rising seven or eight feet above the roof, the\r\nother end being buried five feet in the ground. In order to avoid\r\nuseless personal displacement, Franklin, the economist of time, made an\r\nautomatic annunciator similar to that devised by Gordon in 1745, and\r\ndescribed by Watson in his _Sequel_, 1746, to apprize him of the advent\r\nof a good thunder-gust. Instead of making the rod of one continuous\r\nlength, it was divided on the staircase, opposite his chamber door, the\r\nends being drawn apart to a horizontal distance of a few inches.\r\nScrewing a pair of tiny gongs to the ends, he suspended between them a\r\nbrass ball, held by a silk thread, to act as clapper. Whenever a\r\nthundercloud came hovering by, the bells began to ring, thereby\r\nsummoning the philosopher to his \"laboratory\" on the staircase.\r\n\r\nFranklin's rod, erected over his house in the summer of 1752, was\r\nevidently intended by him for experimental rather than protective\r\npurposes. There is no doubt whatever in his mind about the use of such\r\npointed conductors for the protection of buildings and ships against the\r\ndestructive effects of lightning. He expressly says, in an article\r\nprinted in _Poor Richard's Almanack_ for 1753, that \"It has pleased God\r\nin His infinite goodness to mankind, to discover to them the means of\r\nsecuring their habitations and other buildings from mischief by thunder\r\nand lightning. The method is this: provide a small iron rod (it may be\r\nmade of the rod-iron used by the nailers), but of such a length, that\r\none end being 3 ft. or 4 ft. in the moist ground, the other may be 6 ft.\r\nor 8 ft. above the highest part of the building. To the upper end of the\r\nrod fasten about a foot of brass-wire, the size of a common knitting\r\nneedle, sharpened to a fine point; the rod may be secured to the house\r\nby a few small staples. If the house or barn be long, there may be a rod\r\nand point at each end, and a middling wire along the ridge from one to\r\nthe other. A house thus furnished will not be damaged by lightning, it\r\nbeing attracted by the points and passing through the metal into the\r\nground without hurting anything. Vessels also, having a sharp-pointed\r\nrod fixed on the top of their masts, with a wire from the foot of the\r\nrod reaching down round one of the shrouds to the water, will not be\r\nhurt by lightning.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known, as Dr. Rotch, Director of the Blue Hill Observatory,\r\nrecently pointed out, that the matter for these almanacs was prepared by\r\nFranklin himself under the pen-name of Richard Saunders. As the above\r\npassage appeared in the almanac for 1753, it is obvious that it must\r\nhave been ready sometime toward the end of 1752. Furthermore, we know\r\nthat it was actually in the hands of the printer in the middle of\r\nOctober of that year, for the _Pennsylvania Gazette_ of Oct. 19th says\r\nthat the almanac was then in press and that it would be on sale shortly.\r\nWhence it follows that the year 1752 is the year of the invention of the\r\nlightning rod, and not 1753 or 1754 as often stated.\r\n\r\nThe instructions given by Franklin include all the essentials necessary\r\nfor the erection of a lightning conductor. It may be made of iron or\r\ncopper, flat or round, but must make good \"sky\" and good \"earth.\" The\r\nformer condition is secured by screwing to the top of the rod either\r\ncopper or platinum terminals ending in sharp points; and the latter, by\r\nburying the lower end deep in moist soil. Between \"sky\" and \"earth\" the\r\nrod must be continuous.\r\n\r\nThe function of the rod is twofold, as Franklin well recognized,\r\npreventive and preservative. It prevents the stroke, under ordinary\r\nconditions, by the action of the points, which send off copious streams\r\nof air and dust particles electrified oppositely to that of the cloud.\r\nEven at a distance, the dangerous potential of the cloud is reduced by\r\nthese convection currents and the stroke ordinarily averted. It is clear\r\nthat ten points are more efficacious than one, and fifty more than five.\r\nHence the number of points which we see distributed over the higher and\r\nmore conspicuous parts of a building, all of which are carefully\r\nconnected with the lightning conductor.\r\n\r\nHowever well a building may theoretically be protected, conditions will\r\noccasionally arise when the rod will inevitably be struck; its\r\npreservative function then comes into play, by which it carries the\r\nenergy of the disruptive discharge safely to earth.\r\n\r\nThe experience of more than a century shows that the lightning-rod\r\naffords protection in the great majority of cases; but it would be at\r\nleast a mild exaggeration to say that it never failed, even when\r\nproperly constructed.\r\n\r\nAt first, the erection of lightning-rods was opposed in the New World as\r\nwell as in the Old: some based their opposition to the novelty on\r\nreligious grounds, saying that, as lightning and thunder are tokens of\r\ndivine wrath, it would be impious to interfere in any way with their\r\nmanifestations. This objection was met by saying that for a parity of\r\nreason we should avoid protecting ourselves against the inclemencies of\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nOthers opposed the use of the rods on the score that they invited or\r\nattracted the flash, which was answered by saying that they attract\r\nlightning as much as a rain-pipe attracts a shower, and no more.\r\n\r\nThe death of Professor Richmann, of the University of St. Petersburg,\r\nalso tended to retard the adoption of the rod for the protection of\r\nbuildings; but the invalidity of that objection became apparent when the\r\ncircumstances of the accident became known. Richmann's conductor was\r\nlike d'Alibard's (1751), an experimental rod, and as such was insulated\r\nat the lower end. It was, therefore, not a lightning-rod at all,\r\ninasmuch as it was not grounded. On August 6th, 1753, during a violent\r\nelectric storm, Richmann happened to be close to his exploring rod\r\nobserving the indications of a roughly-made electrometer, when a sharp\r\nthunder-clap was heard, and at the same instant a ball of fire was seen\r\nby Richmann's assistant to dart from the apparatus and strike the head\r\nof the unfortunate Professor, who fell over on a near-by chest and\r\nexpired instantly. His assistant was stunned for a while. On regaining\r\nconsciousness, he ran to the aid of the Professor; but it was too late,\r\nthe body was lifeless.\r\n\r\nIn recording this tragic event, Priestley, the historian of electricity,\r\nsays that, \"It is not given to every electrician to die in so glorious a\r\nmanner as the justly envied Richmann.\"\r\n\r\nFor one, we do not \"envy\" Professor Richmann's fate, and we think that\r\nthe phrase \"tragic manner\" would better suit the circumstances of his\r\ndeath than the \"glorious manner\" of Dr. Priestley.\r\n\r\nRisks of a similar character were taken by Franklin in Philadelphia, de\r\nRomas in Bordeaux, and d'Alibard's representative at Marly, when\r\nexperimenting with kites and insulated rods; they took their lives in\r\ntheir hands, though they may not have thought so.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Sir William Preece said that a man might with impunity\r\n\"clasp a copper rod an inch in diameter, the bottom of which is well\r\nconnected with moist earth, while the top of it receives a violent flash\r\nof lightning; the conductor might even be surrounded by gunpowder in the\r\nheaviest storm without risk or danger.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not on record that the English electrician ever clasped a\r\nlightning conductor or even stood in close proximity to one during an\r\nelectric storm. The above statement was as sensational as it was unwise\r\nand foolhardy. The neighborhood of a rod during a storm is a zone of\r\ndanger, owing to the electrical surgings which are set up in it, and, as\r\nsuch, is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe death of Richmann caused quite a sensation throughout Europe, and\r\nnaturally the lightning-rod came in for severe condemnation. Among the\r\nmemoirs to which the fatality gave rise was one written in the heart of\r\nMoravia and addressed to the celebrated Euler, Director of the Academy\r\nof Sciences at Berlin. The writer was a monk of the Premonstratensian\r\nOrder, whose field of labor was at Prenditz.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1754, this country priest made experiments with lightning\r\nconductors on a scale that transcended anything done in Paris, London or\r\nPhiladelphia. The accompanying illustrations show the conductor which\r\nDivisch (also Diwisch) raised at Prenditz (also Brenditz) in the summer\r\nof that year to demonstrate publicly the efficacy of such apparatus in\r\nbreaking up thunder-clouds and neutralizing the destructive energy pent\r\nup in their electric charges. Prenditz, it would appear, suffered\r\nseverely from electric storms; and it was mainly for the safety of the\r\nlocality that the good priest devoted himself with earnestness to the\r\nstudy of electrical phenomena.\r\n\r\nAs such a man deserves to live in the memory of posterity, we have\r\nsought out the leading facts of his career mainly from Father Alphons\r\nZák, of Pernegg, in Lower Austria, a distinguished writer of the Order\r\nto which Divisch belonged, and have woven such details as we obtained\r\nfrom him and others into the simple narrative that follows.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18 Procopius Divisch (1696-1765)]\r\n\r\nProcopius Divisch (Prokop Diwisch) was born on Aug. 1st, 1696, at\r\nHelkowitz-Senftenberg in Bohemia. He spent his youth at Znaim, where he\r\nstudied the humanities and philosophy at the College conducted by the\r\nJesuit fathers in that Moravian city. In 1719, when in his twenty-third\r\nyear, he decided to quit the common ways of the world in order to lead\r\nthe higher life in the Premonstratensian Order at Kloster-Bruck. At the\r\nripe age of 30, Divisch was ordained priest, in 1726, after which he\r\ntaught philosophy and theology to classes of young aspirants to the\r\necclesiastical state. In 1733 he went to the University of Salzburg and\r\nwon his double Doctorate in theology and philosophy. Three years later,\r\nin 1736, he was appointed parish priest of Prenditz, a small Moravian\r\ntown on the road to Austerlitz, since of Napoleonic fame. Here he\r\nremained for five years, returning in 1741 to Bruck as Prior of the\r\nKloster or monastery situated there. At the end of the Seven Years' War\r\nof the Austrian succession, he quitted Bruck, in 1745, for his parish at\r\nPrenditz, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in the\r\npastoral ministrations of his sacred office and in electrical\r\nexperimentation, of which he was very fond.\r\n\r\nThe curative property of the new agent was heralded throughout Europe\r\nabout this time in terms of unmeasured praise. Some of Divisch's ailing\r\nparishioners, believing him to be an expert in electrical manipulation,\r\napplied to him for a little alleviation of their woes. The good-hearted\r\npriest did not turn them away, but thought it desirable to treat them to\r\nthe therapeutic effect of such sparks as he could get from his homemade\r\nfrictional machine. The results were various, depending probably on the\r\nconfidence and imagination of the patient. Several remarkable cures\r\nseem to have been effected either by the electric spark or by the\r\npersuasive powers of the operator, or by both combined, with the result\r\nthat people far and wide were divided in their opinion of the Pastor of\r\nPrenditz. Some physicians said that he was interfering with their\r\npractice, and even clergymen found fault with him for indulging in work\r\nwhich they thought unsuited to the cloth. A general impression, too,\r\nseems to have prevailed that his electrical experiments, especially\r\nthose with his lightning conductor, were likely to prove harmful in more\r\nways than one.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Divisch had admirers in high places, among whom were\r\nthe Emperor Francis I. of Germany and his imperial consort, Maria\r\nTheresa. Having been invited to Vienna, Divisch repaired to the Austrian\r\ncapital, where, with the aid of Father Franz, another electrical\r\ndevotee, he gave a demonstration of the wonderful capability of the new\r\nform of energy before the grandees of the empire.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the electrical property of points, he showed their\r\ndischarging power in a very original way, one which must have made his\r\nassistant uneasy for a while. At times, the machine worked by Father\r\nFranz gave excellent results; at others, it failed to generate. It was\r\nnoticed by the critical few that when the machine failed, Divisch was\r\nclose by; while when it worked normally, he was at some distance away.\r\nAfter a number of such alternations of success and failure which sorely\r\nperplexed the assistant, himself a man of renown in Vienna, Divisch\r\nexplained the occurrence by saying, with a merry twinkle in his eye,\r\nthat the failure of the machine to generate when he was close to it,\r\napparently seeking out the cause of the breakdown, was due to a number\r\nof pin-like conductors which he had concealed for the purpose in his\r\nperuke and which neutralized the charge on the rotating generator!\r\n\r\nThe identity of the lightning of our skies with the artificial\r\nelectricity of our laboratories was suspected by many before the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century. Englishmen like Hauksbee, Hall, Gray, Freke,\r\nMartin and Watson; Germans like Bose and Winkler, and Frenchmen like\r\nAbbé Nollet, had already published their suspicions and conjectures\r\nanent the matter. Franklin, too, had indicated twelve points of analogy\r\nbetween the two, in 1749, in his letter to Collinson, of London. Though\r\nhe felt the force of the analogical agreement, he also felt that the\r\nmatter could not be definitely settled without an appeal to experiment.\r\nAccordingly, he added: \"The electric fluid is attracted by points; we do\r\nnot know whether this property is in lightning. But since they agree in\r\nall the particulars wherein we can already compare them, is it not\r\nprobable that they agree likewise in this? Let the experiment be made.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19 The Divisch lightning conductor (1754)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20]\r\n\r\nThe experiment was made by Franklin himself by means of his kite two\r\nyears later, in the summer of 1752, and also by the lightning-rod which\r\nhe erected over his own house in the autumn of the same year. Doubtless\r\nDivisch heard of the marvelous effects obtained from d'Alibard's\r\ninsulated conductor at Marly; at any rate, he erected in an open space\r\nat some little distance from his rectory at Prenditz, a lightning\r\nconductor 130 feet in height. As will be seen from the illustration, it\r\nbristled with points, for the Bohemian wizard argued rightly that five\r\npoints would be more efficient than one, and 50 more efficacious than\r\nfive. The weird-looking structure destined to ward off the lightning of\r\nheaven had no less than 325 well-distributed points. Lodge says in his\r\n_Lightning Conductors_: \"Points to the sky are recognized as correct;\r\nonly I wish to advocate more of them, any number of them, like barbed\r\nwire along ridges and eaves. If you want to neutralize a thunder-bolt,\r\nthree points are not as effective as 3000.\" This was written in 1892;\r\nnearly 140 years before that date, we find a simple parish priest of an\r\nobscure village in Moravia using precisely such a multiple system of\r\nshort, pointed conductors for the protection of life and property. This\r\nlightning conductor or _meteorological machine_, as Divisch called it,\r\nwas erected by him at Prenditz on June 15th, 1754. On the top of the rod\r\nwill be seen three light vanes, which were added in the interest of the\r\nfeathered race in order to prevent incautious members from incurring the\r\nrisk of electrocution by alighting on the apparatus during a storm. The\r\nwind whirled the vanes round like the cups of an anemometer, and thus\r\nkept the birds away from the zone of danger.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21 Set of pointed rods]\r\n\r\nSeveral trials came to the electrical Pastor, and from quarters least\r\nexpected. It happened in the second year after the erection of the\r\napparatus that the summer was unusually dry, in consequence of which the\r\ncrops failed almost completely. The farmers of the neighborhood were\r\nalways suspicious of the strange-looking mast of Prenditz; and, be it\r\nsaid, that they were more than diffident about the propriety of\r\ninterfering with the forces of nature even under the plea of protection,\r\nforgetting that they took great care to protect themselves against heat\r\nand cold, rain, snow and hail. The country ladies, no doubt, used\r\nparasols for one kind of protection; and the gentry, umbrellas for\r\nanother. Anyhow, the people of Prenditz and the good folk around did not\r\nlike the lofty mast, with its outstretched arms and bristling rows of\r\nsuspicious-looking iron points connected to the ground by means of four\r\nlong, heavy chains. For the nonce, they deemed their Pastor a queer\r\nfellow, who thought that he could avert the anger of heaven by the\r\noddest kind of a machine which they ever laid their eyes on. It was\r\nargued in the councils of the hamlets that, whatever advantages Divisch\r\nclaimed for his \"machine,\" they were all of a negative character. It\r\n_prevented_ the lightning stroke, he said; that might be, but they did\r\nnot _see_ the prevention. What they did see and keenly realize was the\r\nfailure of their crops. That affected them very closely; and if, as they\r\nsupposed, the apparatus of Prenditz had anything to do with it, the\r\nsooner they got rid of the machine the better. Divisch, it must be said,\r\nwas liked by his people; but despite his popularity, the men of violence\r\ncarried the day and the machine was doomed. Popular passion, excited by\r\npersonal interest, got the better of the consideration due to the\r\nPastor. On an appointed day, a band of bellicose farmers came down on\r\nthe village and wrecked the apparatus which had cost the priest so much\r\nthought and manual labor and on which, knowingly and justly, he relied\r\nfor the protection of the homesteads of his rustic flock.\r\n\r\nThis recalls a similar incident of mob violence which occurred at St.\r\nOmer in the north of France, where a manufacturer of that quaint old\r\ntown, who had been in America and seen the usefulness of lightning\r\nconductors, proceeded to erect one over his own house. Hardly was it\r\ncompleted before the populace gathered together; and, when passion was\r\nsufficiently aroused by inflammatory remarks of the demagogues, the\r\nhouse was attacked and the conductor torn down. The manufacturer\r\ncomplained of the inaction of the \"gardiens de la paix\" and appealed to\r\nthe courts to uphold his right to protect his home against lightning. He\r\nentrusted his case to a young, brilliant lawyer, as yet unknown to fame,\r\nbut one destined to achieve unenviable notoriety during the\r\nrevolutionary period. This, the first defender of the lightning-rod in a\r\ncourt of justice, was Robespierre.\r\n\r\nThe news of the untoward event soon reached the ears of the\r\nPremonstratensian's superiors at Kloster-Bruck; and, as they very wisely\r\nconsidered that the duty of a country priest is primarily to attend to\r\nthe spiritual welfare of his people, rather than to invent machines for\r\ntheir protection against the bolts of heaven, they advised him to yield\r\nto the prejudice of his people and not reconstruct the objectionable\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nFather Divisch accepted the friendly advice of his superiors and obeyed\r\nlike a good Premonstratensian monk. The remains of the shattered\r\n\"meteorological machine\" were sent to the abbey at Bruck, where they\r\ncould be seen for many years afterward. As a consequence of this act of\r\nvandalism, Divisch gave up experimenting with lightning-rods and with\r\nelectricity itself. The villagers were satisfied, but the world at large\r\nlost the benefit that might accrue from the researches on atmospheric\r\nelectricity which Divisch would have carried on during the remaining\r\nnineteen years of his life.\r\n\r\nIn giving up electricity, the disappointed priest turned his attention,\r\nfirst, to acoustics and then, practical man as he was, to the\r\nconstruction of musical instruments. It was not long before his genius\r\nbrought out an orchestrion of wind and stringed instruments which was\r\nplayed like an organ with hands and feet, and which was capable of 130\r\ndifferent combinations. Prince Henry of Prussia offered a considerable\r\nsum of money for the invention, but Divisch died while the preliminaries\r\nof sale were arranging, and negotiations were broken off. The instrument\r\nremained for many years in the abbey at Bruck, where it was in daily use\r\nfor the canonical office.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious coincidence that Franklin was also interested in musical\r\ninstruments. He is credited with having devised an improved form of\r\nglass harmonica, one of which he presented to Queen Marie Antoinette.\r\n\r\nDespite the bitter experience of Divisch, the introduction of lightning\r\nconductors into Italy was warmly advocated some years later by Padre\r\nToaldo (1719-1797), an admirer and correspondent of Franklin. It was\r\nthrough his influence and personal activity that the magnificent\r\nthirteenth-century Cathedral of Siena was protected with lightning\r\nconductors after having been repeatedly struck during the centuries and\r\nseriously damaged. Toaldo published in 1774 his celebrated work on the\r\nprotection of public edifices and private buildings against lightning;\r\nit contributed greatly to reassure public opinion on the value of\r\n\"Franklinian rods,\" as the conductors were commonly called.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that Franklin used the words \"the electric\r\nfluid is attracted by the points\" in the passage quoted above, inasmuch\r\nas in the popular mind such \"attraction\" courts rather than averts\r\ndanger. As already said, the rod no more \"attracts\" lightning than a\r\nrain-pipe attracts a downpour. Franklin knew very well the twofold\r\nfunction of his rods, the _preventive_, by which they tend to ward off\r\nthe stroke by gradually and silently neutralizing the excessive energy\r\nof the cloud; and the other, the _preservative_, by which they convey\r\nthe discharge safely to earth when struck. He even complains of people\r\nwho concentrate their attention on the preventive function, forgetting\r\nthe other entirely, adding that, \"Wherever my opinion is examined in\r\nEurope, nothing is considered but the probability of these rods\r\npreventing a stroke, which is only a part of the use which I proposed\r\nfor them; and the other part, their conducting a stroke which they may\r\nhappen not to prevent, seems to be totally forgotten, though of equal\r\nimportance and advantage.\" (1755.)\r\n\r\nAt a time, it was customary to make the rods rise to a considerable\r\nheight above the building, in the belief that the diameter of the circle\r\nof protection was four times the height of the rod. Such a rule was an\r\narbitrary one which facts soon showed to be unreliable and unsafe. It is\r\nnow recognized that there is no such thing as a definite area of\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nWere this a literary chapter, we would point out that either of the\r\nexpressions \"electric\" storm or \"lightning\" storm is preferable to\r\n_thunder-storm_, because electricity or lightning is the active agent or\r\nprincipal feature of the impressive phenomenon. No one thinks of calling\r\na hailstorm by the descriptive term of _patter-storm_; yet that would be\r\njust as logical and appropriate an appellative in one case as\r\nthunder-storm is in the other.\r\n\r\n_Thunder-tube_ is certainly a startling misnomer applied to the long,\r\nnarrow, glazed tubes formed in siliceous materials by the fervid heat of\r\nthe flash, but not in any way by the sound-waves produced by the crash.\r\n_Thunder-bolt_ does not mean, despite the common opinion, a white-hot\r\nmass that accompanies the discharge; it is purely and simply the flash\r\nitself. A glowing mass that happens to come down in the track of the\r\ndischarge is a _meteorite_, a body of cosmic not terrestrial origin, a\r\nvisitor from space that chose the rarefied path of the flash for its\r\ndescent to earth.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are no _thunder-clouds_ in nature, only electric clouds or\r\nlightning clouds; nor is there ever _thunder in the air_ save when the\r\nlightning breaks from cloud to cloud, or leaps from cloud to earth, or\r\nstrikes from earth to cloud. But though thunder is only occasionally in\r\nthe air, electricity always is. We have a normal electrical field in all\r\nseasons, times and places.\r\n\r\nThough it is the lightning that kills and not the thunder, we would not,\r\nhowever, object to the following inscription which we found on a\r\ntombstone:\r\n\r\n    \"Here lies (so and so), oh! what a wonder,\r\n    She was killed outright by a peal of thunder,\"\r\n\r\nbecause the suddenness of the peal may have given the aged lady a shock\r\nfrom which her failing heart was unable to recover.\r\n\r\nWe are well aware that such criticism of technical terms in popular use\r\nwill have no reform effect whatever; because as long as people will say\r\n\"the sun rises\" and \"the stars set,\" they will continue to speak of\r\nthunder-clouds and thunder-storms, thunder-tubes and thunder-bolts.\r\nThough containing an element of error, these expressions have the\r\nsanction of the centuries; and so, they have come to stay.\r\n\r\nReturning to Divisch, that worthy priest and pioneer electrician died at\r\nPrenditz in his sixty-ninth year, on Dec. 21st, 1765, and was buried in\r\nthe little churchyard where he had blessed many a grave during the\r\ntwenty-five years of his ministration. A simple inscription marks the\r\nplace of his interment, but a monument will soon be erected to his\r\nmemory which will tell the passerby where sleeps the Premonstratensian\r\npioneer of the lightning-rod.\r\n\r\nAbout three months before the erection of his rod, _i.e._, in June,\r\n1752, the idea occurred to Franklin that he could approach the region of\r\nclouds just as well by means of a common kite. Here are his words anent\r\nthe novel and famous experiment with the \"lightning kite\":\r\n\r\n     \"Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long\r\n     as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief\r\n     when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to the\r\n     extremities of the cross, so you have the body of a kite, which,\r\n     being properly accommodated with a tail, loop and string, will\r\n     rise in the air, like those made of paper; but this, being of silk,\r\n     is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust without\r\n     tearing. To the top of the upright stick is to be fixed a very\r\n     sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or two above the wood. In the end\r\n     of the twine, next the hand, is to be held a silk ribbon, and where\r\n     the silk and cord join a key may be fastened. This kite is to be\r\n     raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on, and the person\r\n     who holds the string must stand within a door or window, or under\r\n     some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and care must\r\n     be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or\r\n     window. As soon as any of the thunder-clouds come over the kite,\r\n     the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the\r\n     kite with all the twine will be electrified, and the loose\r\n     filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by\r\n     an approaching finger. And when the rain has wetted the kite, so\r\n     that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it\r\n     stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your\r\n     knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged, and from electric\r\n     fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled and all the other\r\n     electric experiments be performed which are usually done by the\r\n     help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of\r\n     the electric matter with that of lightning completely\r\n     demonstrated.\"[8]\r\n\r\nHere we have the electric kite and manner of using it fully described\r\nwithout, however, any direct statement that the author himself actually\r\nexperimented with it, although he does say that the experiment was\r\nsuccessfully carried out. This is strictly true, but it may be safely\r\ncontended that the precautions enumerated, the observation about the\r\nfibres of the cord, its improved conductivity when wetted by the rain\r\nand the like, all bespeak a knowledge of practical conditions that could\r\nbe obtained only by way of experiment.\r\n\r\nBut if Franklin is not outspoken on the matter, some of his\r\ncontemporaries are. Here is the kite incident as related in the\r\n_Continuation of the Life of Dr. Franklin_, by Dr. Stuber, a\r\nPhiladelphian and intimate friend of the Franklins:\r\n\r\n     \"While Franklin was waiting for the erection of a spire, it\r\n     occurred to him that he might have more ready access to the region\r\n     of clouds by means of a common kite. He prepared one by fastening\r\n     two cross-sticks to a silk handkerchief, which would not suffer so\r\n     much from the rain as paper. To the upright stick was affixed an\r\n     iron point. The string was, as usual, of hemp, except the lower\r\n     end, which was silk. Where the hempen string terminated, a key was\r\n     fastened. With this apparatus, on the appearance of a thunder-gust\r\n     approaching, he went out into the commons, accompanied by his son,\r\n     to whom alone he communicated his intentions, well knowing the\r\n     ridicule which, too generally for the interest of science, awaits\r\n     unsuccessful experiments in philosophy. He placed himself under a\r\n     shed to avoid the rain. His kite was raised. A thunder-cloud passed\r\n     over it. No sign of electricity appeared. He almost despaired of\r\n     success, when suddenly he observed the loose fibres of his string\r\n     move toward an erect position. He now presented his knuckle to the\r\n     key and received a strong spark. Repeated sparks were drawn from\r\n     the key, the phial was charged, a shock given, and all the\r\n     experiments made which are usually performed with electricity.\"\r\n\r\nThis testimony of a man who enjoyed the unlimited confidence of Franklin\r\nhas a very matter-of-fact ring about it; there is not a note of\r\nuncertainty, not a word indicating doubt that his friend and neighbor\r\nwent out to the fields accompanied by his robust son, carrying along\r\nwith them a queer assortment of electrical impedimenta. This son,\r\nWilliam by name, was twenty-two years of age at the time; and as he died\r\nin 1813, eleven years after the publication of Dr. Stuber's\r\nbiographical sketch, he had ample time to contradict the kite story if\r\ninstead of being a fact it were a mere romance. Nor is this all, for Dr.\r\nStuber's narrative, given above, appears textually in the \"Memoirs of\r\nthe Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin,\" edited by his grandson\r\nWilliam Temple Franklin. The Doctor, be it remarked, was very fond of\r\nhis grandson, whose \"faithful service and filial attachment\" he warmly\r\ncommends in several of his letters, and whose regard for the memory of\r\nthe statesman led him to undertake the task of preparing his works for\r\npublication. On page 211, Vol. I., he tells us that \"As Dr. Franklin\r\nmentioned his electrical discoveries only in a very transient way, and\r\nas they are of a most important and interesting nature, it has been\r\nthought that a short disgression on the subject would be excusable and\r\nnot void of entertainment. For this purpose the following account of the\r\nsame, including the first experiment of the lightning kite, as given by\r\nDr. Stuber, is here given.\"\r\n\r\nIn these concluding lines we have the testimony of Franklin's grandson\r\nto the authenticity of the \"lightning kite\" story. Moreover, the account\r\nas given by Stuber evidently meets with his cordial approval, since he\r\ntranscribes it verbatim; and, as if to invest the quotations with\r\nunimpeachable authority, he tells us in the preface, p. viii., that\r\n\"they deserve entire dependence because of the accuracy of the\r\ninformation imparted.\"\r\n\r\nA word now from Priestley, also one of Franklin's intimate friends. In\r\nhis _History of Electricity_, fourth edition, p. 171, he says that \"Dr.\r\nFranklin, astonishing as it must have appeared, continued actually to\r\nbring lightning from the heavens by means of an electrical kite which he\r\nraised when a storm of thunder was perceived to be coming on.\" Then\r\nfollows a description taken almost word for word from Dr. Stuber, whom\r\nhe styles \"the best authority on the subject.\"\r\n\r\nIf, perchance, the above testimony should not be deemed conclusive and\r\nfinal, all lingering doubt must be removed by Franklin's own words, for\r\nin his _Autobiography_, after briefly referring to the experiments made\r\nin France with pointed conductors, he adds: \"I will not swell this\r\nnarrative with an account of that capital experiment (the pointed\r\nconductor), nor of the infinite pleasure which I received on the success\r\nof a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both\r\nare to be found in histories of electricity.\"\r\n\r\nHere, at last, we have Franklin's own word for it, that he made the kite\r\nexperiment, and that he made it \"soon after\" the demonstration of his\r\nelectrical discoveries which M. de Lor gave, by request, before Louis\r\nXV. and his court.\r\n\r\nThe \"lightning kite\" is, therefore, not a myth, as some have ventured to\r\nthink, having been fully described by Franklin in his letter to Peter\r\nCollinson, dated October 19th, 1752, and having been made by him some\r\ntime in June of the same year.\r\n\r\nWe have now to see whether Franklin was anticipated in the idea of the\r\nkite or in its use for electrical purposes. There are some who hold that\r\nhe was anticipated by M. de Romas as to the idea, but not the actual\r\nexperiment; while others credit the French magistrate with both. Let us\r\nexamine the evidence which there is for these opinions.\r\n\r\nM. de Romas lived in Nérac, a small town some seventy-five miles south\r\nof Bordeaux. He was a member of the bar; and at the time of the\r\nFranklinian furor in Europe was a judge of the district court. He took\r\nan interest in scientific matters quite unusual for men of his\r\nprofession, proceeding, as soon as he had read of the efficiency of\r\npointed conductors, to study their behavior for himself. His experiments\r\nmet with surprising success, and were as much admired by the local\r\nsavants as they were dreaded by the common folk. Letters containing his\r\nobservations were regularly sent to the Academy of Bordeaux, where they\r\nwere read with lively interest on account of their character and\r\nnovelty. From the published _Actes_ of that body we learn that the first\r\nkite used by de Romas was raised by him on May 14th, 1753.\r\nDisappointment, however, attended this attempt, no electrical\r\nmanifestation being observed, although rain fell and wetted the hempen\r\ncord. The magistrate of Nérac attributed his failure to the resistance\r\nof the string; and, like a good electrician, surprisingly good for the\r\ntime, determined to improve its conductivity by wrapping a fine copper\r\nwire round its entire length. When this long and tedious operation was\r\ncompleted, he went out again to the fields on a stormy day, when,\r\nassisted by two of his friends, he raised the kite and soon got torrents\r\nof sparks from the wire-wound cord. This was on June 7th, 1753. The\r\nexperiment was repeated from time to time, both for his own satisfaction\r\nand that of his assistants as well as for the entertainment of his\r\never-growing class of admiring spectators. Kites 7-1/2 ft. long and 3\r\nft. wide were raised 400 and even 550 ft. above ground when flashes nine\r\nfeet long and an inch thick were drawn, so the account says, with the\r\nreport of a pistol. The effect must have been truly spectacular. The\r\nkite was held by a silk ribbon fastened to the end of the hempen cord.\r\n\r\nIt is then a matter of history vouched for by the _Actes_ of the Academy\r\nof Bordeaux that May 14th, 1753, is the day on which the first use of a\r\nkite for electrical purposes was made in France; on the other hand, it\r\nis to be remembered that Franklin flew his \"lightning kite\" in June,\r\n1752, almost a year earlier. As far, then, as the _fact_ is concerned,\r\nthe Philadelphia philosopher was not anticipated by the Justice of\r\nNérac.\r\n\r\nFrom facts let us pass to writings. Franklin's letter to Collinson, in\r\nwhich he describes the electric kite, is dated October 19th, 1752, while\r\nthat of M. de Romas, on which the claim for priority is founded, was\r\naddressed by him to the Academy of Bordeaux on July 12th, 1752, three\r\nmonths earlier. After a lengthy and interesting account of his\r\nexperiments with pointed conductors, he concludes his communication as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"C'est là, Monsieur, ce qu'il y a de plus important, car j'aurais bien\r\nd'autres particularités à vous communiquer; mais ma lettre, devenue\r\nd'une excessive longueur, m'avertit de finir. Je me réserve de mettre au\r\njour la dernière (quoiquelle ne soit qu'un jeu d'enfant) lorsque je me\r\nserai assuré de la réussite par l'expérience que je me propose d'en\r\nfaire et que je ne negligerai pas.\"\r\n\r\nIn English this would read: \"Such, Sir, are the more important points\r\nwhich I have to communicate, and to which many others might be added,\r\nwere it not for the excessive length of this letter, which warns me that\r\nit is time to bring it to a close. I will, however, give publicity to\r\nthe last one of all (though it is only a child's plaything) as soon as I\r\nshall have assured myself of its success by an experiment which I have\r\ndevised and which I shall not fail to make.\"\r\n\r\nThe words in brackets--\"though it is only a child's plaything\"--are all\r\nimportant, for it is on them and on them alone that the claim for\r\npriority has been put forth and maintained. It will be seen that the\r\nword kite (_cerf-volant_), does not occur in the letter, so that there\r\ncan be no absolute certainty as to the nature of the _jeu d'enfant_\r\nwhich the author had in mind, though it is very likely that the kite was\r\nmeant. In his _Mémoire sur les moyens de se garantir de la foudre dans\r\nles maisons_, he says, after describing some experiments that he had\r\nmade with pointed rods: \"Néanmoins toujours plein du désir d'augmenter\r\nle volume du feu électricque, il fallut chercher le moyen pour y\r\nparvenir. En conséquence, je me plongeai dans de nouvelles méditations.\r\nEnfin une demi-heure après, tout au plus, le cerf-volant des enfants se\r\nprésenta tout à coup à mon esprit, et il me tardait de la mettre à\r\nl'épreuve. Par malheur, je n'en avais pas le temps.\" In English: \"Being\r\nanxious to augment the quantity of electric fire, I began to think of\r\nsome means to effect my purpose, and soon became quite absorbed with the\r\nsubject. Not more than half an hour elapsed before the idea of the kite\r\nsuddenly occurred to me, and I longed for an opportunity to try it; but\r\nunfortunately I had not sufficient leisure at the time.\" The work in\r\nwhich this passage occurs was published at Bordeaux in 1776, shortly\r\nafter the death of the author. De Romas always maintained that he did\r\nnot borrow the idea of the kite from any one, but that it occurred to\r\nhim while pursuing his experiments with pointed conductors.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that de Romas could not have been acquainted with\r\nFranklin's performance of June, 1752, when he sent to the Bordeaux\r\nAcademy his letter of July 12th, of the same year, for we cannot suppose\r\nthat in an age of sailing vessels such news would cross the Atlantic and\r\nreach an obscure provincial town in the southwest of France in the space\r\nof a month. On the other hand, it is equally improbable that a vague\r\nallusion to the electrical use of a kite made at Nérac on July 12th, by\r\na man entirely unknown to fame as was de Romas, should be talked of on\r\nthe banks of the Schuylkill before October 19th, the date of Franklin's\r\nmemorable letter to Collinson. Moreover, the \"_jeu d'enfant_\" allusion\r\nas well as the very use of the kite by de Romas failed so completely to\r\nattract the attention of scientific men of his own country that he\r\nfrequently and bitterly complained down to the end of his life, in 1776,\r\nof their persistent neglect of his claims to recognition.\r\n\r\nFrom all this, we conclude:\r\n\r\n(_a_) That Franklin's \"lightning kite\" is not a myth, the experiment\r\nhaving been made by him in June, 1752, and fully described by him in a\r\nmemorable letter written to Peter Collinson, of London, dated October\r\n19th of the same year:\r\n\r\n(_b_) That de Romas independently had the idea of using a kite for\r\nelectrical purposes as early as July 12th, 1752; but that he did not\r\ncarry out his idea until May 14th, 1753; and, furthermore, that he did\r\nnot succeed in getting any electrical manifestations until June 7th,\r\n1753, his success then being due, at least in part, to the clever idea\r\nwhich he had of entwining the cord with a fine copper wire. Therefore,\r\n_suum cuique_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we would say that the cardinal and enduring achievements\r\nof Franklin are:\r\n\r\n(1) His rejection of the two-fluid theory of electricity and\r\nsubstitution of the one-fluid theory; (2) his coinage of the\r\nappropriate terms _positive_ and _negative_, to denote an excess or a\r\ndeficit of the common electric fluid; (3) his explanation of the Leyden\r\njar, and, notably, his recognition of the paramount role played by the\r\nglass or dielectric; (4) his experimental demonstration of the identity\r\nof lightning and electricity; and (5) his invention of the lightning\r\nconductor for the protection of life and property, together with his\r\nclear statement of its preventive and protective functions.\r\n\r\nIf Franklin was well acquainted with electrical phenomena, it is safe to\r\nsay that his knowledge of human nature was wider and deeper still. This\r\nappears continually in his _Autobiography_, in his political writings,\r\nin business transactions and diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, while his re-election as clerk of the General Assembly\r\nwas pending, a certain member made a long speech against him. Franklin\r\nlistened with calm, dignified composure; and after his election, instead\r\nof resenting the opposition of the offending member, he determined that\r\nit would be better to disarm his antagonism and win his friendship. For\r\nthis purpose he sent the assemblyman a courteously-worded request for\r\nthe loan of a very scarce book which was in his library. The book was\r\nsent to Franklin, who returned it within a week with a note of thanks,\r\nwhich had the desired effect. Commenting on the event, our philosopher\r\nsays that \"it is more profitable to remove than to resent inimical\r\nproceedings.\"\r\n\r\nSome of Franklin's views on general political economy are tersely set\r\nforth in the following passage: \"There seem, in fine, to be but three\r\nways for a nation to acquire wealth. The first is by _war_, as the\r\nRomans did in plundering their conquered neighbor; this is _robbery_.\r\nThe second is by _commerce_, which is generally _cheating_. The third is\r\nby _agriculture_, the only _honest way_ wherein man receives a real\r\nincrease of the seed thrown into the ground, in a kind of continual\r\nmiracle wrought by the hand of God in his favour, as a reward for his\r\ninnocent life and virtuous industry.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin asserts his religious convictions in many passages of his\r\n\"Autobiography\" as well as on many occasions of his public life. Shocked\r\nby \"Tom\" Paine's views of fundamental religious truths, he says: \"I have\r\nread your manuscript with some attention. By the argument which it\r\ncontains against a particular Providence, though you allow a general\r\nProvidence, you strike at the foundation of all religion. For, without\r\nthe belief of a Providence that takes cognizance of, guards and guides,\r\nand may favour particular persons, there is no motive to worship a\r\nDeity, to fear His displeasure, or to pray for His protection. I will\r\nnot enter into any discussion of your principles, though you seem to\r\ndesire it. At present, I shall only give you my opinion that, though\r\nyour reasonings are very subtile and may prevail with some readers, you\r\nwill not succeed so as to change the general sentiments of mankind on\r\nthat subject; and the consequence of printing this piece will be a great\r\ndeal of odium drawn upon yourself, mischief to you, and no benefit to\r\nothers. He that spits against the wind, spits in his own face.\"\r\n\r\nThis aphorism recalls the ripe wisdom contained in many of the sayings\r\nof \"Poor Richard,\" for Franklin was a deep thinker, shrewd observer and\r\nquaint expositor of his own philosophy. Continuing, he fleeces Paine in\r\nthe following noble words: \"But were you to succeed, do you imagine any\r\ngood would be done by it? You yourself may find it easy to live a\r\nvirtuous life without the assistance afforded by religion; you having a\r\nclear perception of the advantages of virtue and the disadvantages of\r\nvice, and possessing strength of resolution sufficient to enable you to\r\nresist common temptations. But think how great a portion of mankind\r\nconsists of weak and ignorant men and women, and of inexperienced,\r\ninconsiderate youth of both sexes, who have need of the motives of\r\nreligion to restrain them from vice, to support them to virtue, and\r\nretain them in the practice of it till it becomes _habitual_, which is\r\nthe great point for its security. And perhaps you are indebted to her\r\noriginally, that is, to your religious education for the habits of\r\nvirtue upon which you now justly value yourself. You might easily\r\ndisplay your excellent talents of reasoning upon a less hazardous\r\nsubject, and thereby obtain a rank with our most distinguished authors.\r\nFor among us, it is not necessary, as among the Hottentots, that a\r\nyouth, to be raised into the company of men, should prove his manhood by\r\nbeating his mother.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin concludes this magnificent expression of his religious faith by\r\nthe solemn warning: \"I would advise you, therefore, not to attempt\r\nunchaining the tiger, but to burn this piece before it is seen by any\r\nother person; whereby you will save yourself a great deal of\r\nmortification by the enemies it may raise against you, and perhaps a\r\ngood deal of regret and repentance. If men are so wicked _with_\r\nreligion, what would they be _without_ it?\"\r\n\r\nFranklin's belief in the cardinal doctrine of the resurrection of the\r\nbody is well expressed in the epitaph which he wrote for himself in\r\n1728, when in his twenty-second year. It reads\r\n\r\n                   The Body\r\n                      Of\r\n               Benjamin Franklin\r\n                    Printer,\r\n         (Like the cover of an old book\r\n              Its contents torn out\r\n     And stript of its lettering and gilding)\r\n           Lies here, food for worms.\r\n          But the work shall not be lost\r\n   For it will (as he believed) appear once more\r\n        In a new and more elegant edition\r\n              Revised and corrected\r\n                       By\r\n                   The Author.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the statesman and philosopher was laid at rest beside his\r\nwife in the Cemetery of Christ Church, Philadelphia, in 1790, the marble\r\nslab which marked the grave bore no other inscription than Franklin's\r\nname and the date of his death.\r\n\r\nAppreciating the great loss which the country sustained by the death of\r\nFranklin, Congress ordered a general mourning for one month throughout\r\nthe fourteen States of the Union; and the French National Assembly\r\ndecreed three days of public mourning at the instance of Mirabeau, who\r\nsaid in his address that \"The genius that gave freedom to America and\r\nscattered torrents of light upon Europe, has returned to the bosom of\r\nthe Divinity. Antiquity would have erected altars to that mortal who for\r\nthe advantage of the human race, embracing both heaven and earth in his\r\nvast mind, knew how to subdue both thunder and tyranny.\"\r\n\r\nThe fugitive apprentice boy of 1723 turned out to be one of the most\r\nesteemed and eminent Americans of his day. Of an even temper and\r\nwell-balanced mind, he was plain in dress, simple in manner, easy of\r\napproach and friendly to all. The success which he achieved during his\r\nlong career of eighty-five years, shows what may be done by seizing the\r\nopportunities which come to every one, by concentration of mind,\r\napplication to duty and tenacity of purpose. He attained distinction in\r\nscience, in letters, in diplomacy; he stood for good government and true\r\nliberty. His name is a household one in his own country, where\r\nmonuments, institutions and cities will bear it down to posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lightning Kite._\r\n\r\nFully described by Franklin in a letter to Peter Collinson, of London,\r\ndated October 19th, 1752.\r\n\r\nStuber in his \"Continuation of the Life of Dr. Franklin,\" and Priestley\r\nin his \"History of Electricity,\" affirm that Franklin made the\r\nexperiment in June, 1752.\r\n\r\nFranklin's son, William, never denied the story, although he figured in\r\nit as an active character.\r\n\r\nWilliam Temple Franklin, who prepared for publication his grandfather's\r\nworks, gives the kite story almost verbatim from Stuber.\r\n\r\nFinally, Franklin himself states that he made the experiment: Memoirs,\r\nVol. I., p. 164.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Franklin and de Romas._\r\n\r\nJune, 1752: Franklin raises his kite in a field near Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nJuly 12, 1752: Letter of de Romas to the Academy of Bordeaux, in which a\r\nprobable reference is made to the kite as _un jeu d'enfant_.\r\n\r\nOctober 19th, 1752: Franklin describes the \"lightning kite\" in a letter\r\nto Peter Collinson, of London.\r\n\r\nMay 14th, 1753: First use by de Romas of the electric kite in the fields\r\naround Nérac; no result.\r\n\r\nJune 7th, 1753: First success by de Romas with his electric kite.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pointed Conductor._\r\n\r\nSuggested by Franklin in letter to Peter Collinson, of London, dated\r\nJuly 29th, 1750.\r\n\r\nD'Alibard, following Franklin's instructions, gets torrents of\r\ndischarges from his iron rod 40 feet high at Marly, May 10th, 1752.\r\n\r\nDe Lor gets good results from his conductor 99 feet high, erected over\r\nhis house in Paris, May 18th, 1752.\r\n\r\nDe Buffon succeeds with his rod on May 19th, 1752.\r\n\r\nFranklin erected the first rod over his house in Philadelphia in\r\nSeptember, 1752.

The reason for his delay was twofold.\r\nWith the characteristic patience of a real investigator in science,\r\nHarvey wanted to work out the details of his discovery for himself\r\nbefore giving it to the public, and wished to be sure of all he would\r\nhave to say about it before committing it to print. He had not, as had\r\nindeed none of the really great discoverers in science, that intense\r\ndesire for publicity which causes smaller men to rush into print with\r\ntheir embryonic discoveries, or oftener, their supposed discoveries, the\r\nmoment they get their first distant glimpse of a new truth or see some\r\nmirage of a distant scientific principle, perhaps already well known, in\r\ntheir heated imaginations. Small men squabble about priority in small\r\ndiscoveries, and rush headlong into print, lest some one should\r\nanticipate their wonderful observation. The example of Harvey can\r\nscarcely be commended too highly, for if followed, it would save the\r\nworld of science a lot of bother and obviate the necessity of taking\r\nback many things that have been proclaimed in the name of science.\r\nFortunately, it has been the rule among genuine students of science, not\r\nbecause of any deliberate imitation of their great predecessors, but\r\nbecause of modest assurance of the worth of their work and honest desire\r\nto perfect it before giving it to the world.\r\n\r\nLuigi, or, as he preferred to be known himself, Aloysio Galvani, for the\r\nyoung prince of the house of Gonzaga whose canonization made him St.\r\nAloysius was his patron in baptism and a favorite in life, presents an\r\ninteresting exemplification of this characteristic trait of the really\r\ngreat discoverer in science, to wait calmly and work faithfully for\r\nthorough confirmation of his views before publishing them. His admirable\r\npatience in reaching the real significance of his discovery before\r\nproclaiming the results of his investigations is only a typical\r\nillustration of the modest thorough scientist that he was. It used to be\r\nsaid that Galvani's discovery of the twitchings of the frog's legs,\r\nwhich led him to give himself to serious investigations into animal\r\nelectricity, was made more or less by accident in 1786. His views on the\r\nsubject of animal electricity were not formally published until the\r\nappearance of his treatise, De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari\r\nCommentarius, in the eighth volume of the Memoirs of the Institute of\r\nScience of Bologna, published in 1791. This would seem to indicate that\r\nonly five years elapsed between his original observation and the\r\npublication of his views. Even this interval may seem long enough to our\r\nmodern notions of at least supposed rapidity of scientific progress,\r\nbut we know now, from documents in the possession of the Institute of\r\nScience at Bologna, that, twenty years previous to the publication of\r\nthis commentary, Galvani was deeply interested in the action of\r\nelectricity upon the muscles of frogs, and was diligently and fruitfully\r\noccupied during his spare time with investigations upon this subject.\r\n\r\nWhen, in Makers of Modern Medicine,[18] I called special attention to\r\nthe fact that practically all of the greatest discoverers in medicine\r\nhad made their cardinal discovery, or at least the far-reaching\r\nobservation that opened up for them the special career in investigation\r\nthat was to make them famous, before they were thirty-five, one of my\r\ncritics doubted the assertion and suggested the case of Galvani as a\r\ndistinct exception. Ordinarily, it is presumed that his discovery of the\r\ntwitchings of frogs' legs under the influence of electricity was made in\r\n1786, when he was in his forty-ninth year. As a matter of fact, however,\r\nhis first observations were made and his attention attracted to the\r\nimportance of the subject when he was scarcely more than thirty. His\r\ncareer is indeed a striking example of the earliness in life at which a\r\ngreat man's work is likely to come to him, and yet illustrates very\r\naptly the patience with which he devotes himself to it, without seeking\r\nthe idle reputation to be derived from immediate announcement, if he\r\nreally has the true spirit of the scientific investigator.\r\n\r\nGalvani began original work of a high order very early in his medical\r\ncareer. His graduation thesis on the human skeleton treated especially\r\nof the formation and development of bone, and attracted no little\r\nattention. It is noteworthy because of the breadth of view in it, for it\r\ntouches on the various questions relative to osteology, from the\r\nstandpoint of physics and chemistry, as well as medicine and surgery. It\r\nwas sufficient to obtain for its author the place of lecturer in anatomy\r\nin the University of Bologna, besides the post of director of the\r\nteaching of anatomy in the Institute of Sciences, a subsidiary\r\ninstitution. Here, from the very beginning, Galvani's course was\r\npopular. He was not, as we note elsewhere, a fluent talker, but he was\r\none of the first who introduced experimental demonstrations of his\r\nsubject into his lectures, and this made his teaching very attractive\r\nand drew crowds to his university courses.\r\n\r\nGalvani's work as an anatomist, however, was done much more in\r\ncomparative anatomy than in the study of the human being. He selected\r\nbirds for the special subject of his first investigations in the field,\r\nand his monograph on the kidneys of birds attracted widespread attention\r\namong the scientists of Europe. As the farthest removed from man of the\r\nbeings that are warm-blooded, these creatures have always attracted\r\nparticular attention, and, quite apart from any interest in evolution,\r\nwere the subject of special investigation. Owing to the facility with\r\nwhich they can be studied in embryonic stages in the hatching egg, most\r\nof the peculiarities of their structure and development are very well\r\nknown now. The kidneys of the bird are especially interesting, because\r\nthey represent a different phase of development from that of human\r\nbeings. Galvani had selected, then, one of the cardinal or turning-point\r\nsubjects in comparative anatomy. As he pointed out very clearly, the\r\nkidneys of birds differ very much among themselves, and the intense\r\nmuscular action of this creature makes a large amount of excretory\r\nmaterial, that must be disposed of, and consequently demands much more\r\nactive kidney function than occurs in most other classes of animals.\r\nGalvani studied every feature--the vessels, the nerves, the canals--and\r\nalmost necessarily pointed out many new points or added hitherto unknown\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nHe next devoted himself to the study of the ear of the bird. This might\r\nseem to be of little special interest, since hearing is not one of the\r\nmost characteristic qualities of the winged species. It so happens,\r\nhowever, that the semi-circular canals which are closely connected with\r\nthe auditory apparatus in all animals are extremely large in birds. As a\r\nconsequence of this, the avian auditory structures assume an importance\r\nin comparative anatomy quite like that of the kidneys in the same\r\nspecies. After Galvani had completed his studies, he found that he had\r\nbeen anticipated by another great Italian anatomist of the time, Antonio\r\nScarpa (of Scarpa's triangle in human anatomy), who afterwards became\r\nthe Chief Surgeon to Napoleon. Galvani abandoned the idea of publishing\r\nhis book then, but published a short article, in which he added much to\r\nScarpa's details and conclusions. His additions were particularly with\r\nregard to the semi-circular canals, which are probably the organ of\r\ndirection, the necessity for which, in this species, for the purpose of\r\nflying, is so easy to understand. He also described with great care the\r\nsingle ossicle or small bone, which replaces the chain of little bones\r\nthat exist in mammal ears, and pointed out that the shape of this bone\r\nand its appendages enabled it to fulfil, though single, all the\r\nfunctions of the hammer, the anvil and the stirrup bones in human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nGalvani's careful study of the semi-circular canals of various species\r\nof birds can perhaps be better appreciated from the fact that he made it\r\na point to measure their size exactly, as compared to the semi-circular\r\ncanals of most other creatures. He found that the semi-circular canals\r\nof the hawk, for instance, were larger than the corresponding structures\r\nin man or even in the cow or the horse. As these latter animals are many\r\nhundred times larger than the largest birds, the special significance of\r\nthe canals in birds becomes manifest. In certain of the birds, as he\r\npointed out, these structures are not semi-circles, nor indeed of\r\ncircular form at all, but take on much more the shape of an ellipse,\r\nand, indeed, sometimes the arc of curvature of the ellipse is quite\r\nacute. He seems to have had no hint, however, of the function that we\r\nhave in modern times assigned to these structures, that of presiding\r\nover direction and equilibrium, and discusses in his rather vigorous\r\nLatin what the physiological significance of them may be as regards\r\nhearing. He thinks that they add something to the acuity of hearing, and\r\nwould seem to imply that in birds flying rapidly through the air, there\r\nwas the necessity for a more perfect hearing apparatus than among other\r\ncreatures, and that this was the reason for the huge development of\r\ntheir semi-circular canals.\r\n\r\nAt this time the science of comparative anatomy was just beginning to\r\nattract widespread attention. John Hunter, in London, was doing a great\r\nwork in this line, which placed him in the front rank of contributors to\r\nbiology and collectors of important facts in all the sciences allied to\r\nanatomy and physiology. Galvani's work on birds, then, made him a\r\npioneer in the biological sciences that were to attract so much\r\nattention during the nineteenth century. His experimental work in\r\ncomparative anatomy, strange as it might seem, and apparently not to be\r\nexpected, led him into the domain of electricity, through the\r\nobservation of certain phenomena of animal electricity and the effects\r\nof electrical currents on animals.\r\n\r\nLike so many other great discoveries in science, Galvani's first\r\nattraction to his subject of animal electricity is often said to have\r\nbeen the result of a happy accident. Of course it is easy to talk of\r\naccidents in these cases. Archimedes and his bath; the fall of the apple\r\nfor Newton; Laennec's observation of the boys tapping on a log in the\r\ncourtyard of the Louvre and the ready conduction of sound, from which he\r\ngot his idea for the invention of the stethoscope; Lord Kelvin's\r\neye-glass falling and showing him how a weightless arm for his\r\nelectrometer might be obtained in a beam of light,--may all be called\r\nhappy accidents if you will. Without the inventive scientific genius\r\nready to take advantage of them, however, these accidents would not have\r\nbeen raised to the higher plane of important incidents in the history of\r\nscience. These phenomena had probably occurred under men's eyes hundreds\r\nof times before, but there was no great mind ready to receive the seeds\r\nof thought suggested, nor to follow out the conclusions so obviously\r\nindicated. Galvani's observation of the twitching of the muscles of the\r\nfrog under the influence of electricity, may be called one of the happy\r\naccidents of scientific development, but it was Galvani's own genius\r\nthat made the accident happy.\r\n\r\nThere are two stories told as to the method of the first observation in\r\nthis matter. Both of them make his wife an important factor in the\r\ndiscovery. According to a popular but less authentic form of the\r\nhistory, Galvani was engaged in preparing some frogs' legs as a special\r\ndainty for his wife, who was ill and liked this delicacy very much. He\r\nthought so much of her that he was doing this himself, in the hope that\r\nshe would be thus more readily tempted to eat them. While so engaged, he\r\nexposed the large nerve of the animal's hind legs, and at the same time\r\nsplit the skin covering the muscles. In doing this he touched the nerve\r\nmuscle preparation, as this has come to be called, with the scalpel and\r\nthe forceps simultaneously, with the result that twitchings occurred.\r\nWhile seeking the cause of these twitchings, the idea of animal\r\nelectricity came to him.\r\n\r\nThe other form of the story is told a little later in Galvani's own\r\nwords in the analysis of his monograph on animal electricity. He does\r\nnot mention his wife in it, but there is a tradition that she was\r\npresent in the laboratory when the phenomenon of the twitching of the\r\nfrog's legs was first noticed, and indeed that it was she who called his\r\nattention to the curious occurrence.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of well-developed intellect, and her association with\r\nher father and also with her husband made her well acquainted with the\r\nanatomy and physiology of the day. She realized that what had occurred\r\nwas quite out of the ordinary. She is even said to have suggested their\r\npossible connection with the presence and action of the electric\r\napparatus. Husband and wife, then, together, by means of a series of\r\nobservations determined that, whenever the apparatus was not in use the\r\nphenomenon of the convulsive movements of the frog's legs did not take\r\nplace, notwithstanding irritation by the scalpel. Whenever the electric\r\napparatus was working, however, then the phenomenon in question always\r\ntook place. According to either form of the story, if we accept the\r\ntraditions in the matter, Madame Galvani had an important part in the\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nGalvani's most important contribution to science is undoubtedly his De\r\nViribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius--Commentary on the\r\nForces of Electricity in Their Relation to Muscular Motion. Like many\r\nanother epoch-making contribution to science, it is not a large work,\r\nbut in his collected works in the edition of 1841, occupies altogether\r\nsixty-four pages, of scarcely more than two hundred and fifty words to\r\nthe page. There are probably not more than fifteen thousand words in it\r\naltogether. It was published originally in the eighth volume of the\r\nMemoirs of the Institute of Science at Bologna, in 1791, but a reprint\r\nof it, with some modifications, was issued at Modena in the following\r\nyear. This Modenese edition, published by the Societa Typographica, was\r\nannotated by Professor Giovanni Aldini, who also wrote an accompanying\r\ndissertation, De Animalis Electricae Theoriae Ortu Atque Incrementis, On\r\nthe Rise and Development of the Theory of Animal Electricity. In this\r\nvolume was also published a letter from Galvani to Professor Carminati,\r\nin Italian, on the Seat of Animal Electricity. These two editions are\r\nthe sources to which we must turn for whatever Galvani tried to make\r\nknown with regard to animal electricity.\r\n\r\nThis little volume consists of four parts: the first of which is devoted\r\nto a consideration of the effects of artificial electricity on muscular\r\nmotion; the second is on the effect of atmospheric electricity on\r\nmuscular motion; the third is on the effect of animal electricity on\r\nmuscular motion; and the fourth consists of a series of conjectures and\r\nsome conclusions from his observations. The arrangement of the work, as\r\ncan readily be understood from this, is thoroughly scientific. Galvani\r\nproceeds from what was best known and most evident to what he knew less\r\nabout, trying to enlarge the bounds of knowledge and then suggesting the\r\nconclusions that might be drawn from his work and offering a number of\r\nhints as to the possible significance of many of the phenomena that\r\nmight form suggestive material for further experimentation along this\r\nsame line. In spite of the forbiddingness of the Latin to a modern\r\nscientist, as a rule, the little work is well worthy of study because of\r\nits eminently scientific method and the excellent evidence it affords of\r\nthe way serious students of science approached a scientific thesis\r\nbefore the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe first paragraph of this dissertation is of such fundamental\r\nsignificance, because it represents the primal work done in animal\r\nelectricity, that it has seemed to me worth while presenting entire. The\r\noriginal Latin from which the translation is made, and from which a good\r\nidea of Galvani's Latin style may be obtained, is given in a note.[17]\r\n\r\n\"I had dissected a frog and had prepared it, as in Figure 2 of the fifth\r\nplate (in which is shown a nerve muscle preparation), and had placed it\r\nupon a table on which there was an electric machine, while I set about\r\ndoing certain other things. The frog was entirely separated from the\r\nconductor of the machine, and indeed was at no small distance away from\r\nit. While one of those who were assisting me touched lightly and by\r\nchance the point of his scalpel to the internal crural nerves of the\r\nfrog, suddenly all the muscles of its limbs were seen to be so\r\ncontracted that they seemed to have fallen into tonic convulsions.\r\nAnother of my assistants, who was making ready to take up certain\r\nexperiments in electricity with me, seemed to notice that this happened\r\nonly at the moment when a spark came from the conductor of the machine.\r\nHe was struck with the novelty of the phenomenon, and immediately spoke\r\nto me about it, for I was at the moment occupied with other things and\r\nmentally preoccupied. I was at once tempted to repeat the experiment, so\r\nas to make clear whatever might be obscure in it. For this purpose I\r\ntook up the scalpel and moved its point close to one or the other of the\r\ncrural nerves of the frog, while at the same time one of my assistants\r\nelicited sparks from the electric machine. The phenomenon happened\r\nexactly as before. Strong contractions took place in every muscle of the\r\nlimb, and at the very moment when the sparks appeared, the animal was\r\nseized as it were with tetanus.\"\r\n\r\nGalvani then explains in detail how he made observations on control\r\nfrogs at moments when there were no electric sparks, and decided that\r\nthe contact with the scalpel was only effective in producing twitchings\r\nwhen there was a simultaneous electric spark. He noted, also, that\r\noccasionally the contractions did not occur, in spite of the fulfilment\r\nof the conditions mentioned. He traced this to fatigue. He then\r\nproceeded to vary the experiment in many ways, decreasing the size of\r\nthe scalpel, increasing and decreasing the size of the electric machine\r\nand varying the method of preparation of the frog, so as to decide just\r\nwhat the significance of the phenomenon was. In a general way, it may be\r\nsaid that this study shows Galvani as one of the most careful of\r\nexperimentalists, though he has often been declared to be a theorizer,\r\nrather than an observer.\r\n\r\nA very interesting anticipation of Galvani's original experiment, made\r\nlong before his time by a great naturalist, the story of which serves to\r\nshow that discoveries made before their time, that is, before people are\r\nready to follow them up, fail to attract attention, has been called to\r\nmy attention by Brother Potamian. In the second volume of the Dutch\r\nNaturalist Swammerdam's Works, page 839, is to be found the following\r\npassage:[14] \"Another experiment that is at once very curious and\r\nsuggestive can be made if one separates the largest of the muscles of\r\nthe thigh of the frog and so prepares it with its adherent nerve as to\r\nleave it unhurt. If after this has been done you take the tendons of\r\nthis muscle, one in each hand, and irritate the hanging nerve by a\r\nlittle forceps or other instrument, the muscle will recover the former\r\nmotion which it had lost. You will see at once that it contracts and\r\nthat there will be an effort as it were to bring together the two hands\r\nwhich hold its tendons. This I demonstrated, in the year 1658, to the\r\nillustrious Duke of Tuscany then reigning, when he was at the moment in\r\na state of mind that prompted him not to favor me. This same experiment\r\ncan be repeated with the same muscle as often and for as long a time as\r\nany portion of the nerve remains uninjured, so that we may, therefore,\r\nirritate the muscle to its former contraction as often as we wish.\"\r\n\r\nAs a foundation classic in electricity, Galvani's De Viribus\r\nElectricitatis deserves more detailed analysis. The first part of the\r\nmonograph is taken up with experiments of many kinds, with what may be\r\ncalled artificial sources of electricity--the electric machine, the\r\nLeyden jar, and other modes of electrical development. The second part\r\ntreats of the effects of atmospheric electricity upon muscular motion,\r\nby which expression Galvani means lightning, though he also observed\r\nvarious electrical manifestations in the muscles of his frogs when there\r\nwas no actual lightning but only darkening of the heavens, without\r\nactual passage of the current flash from one cloud to another or from\r\nthe clouds to the earth. In this matter, Galvani displayed quite as much\r\ncourage as patient observation. He knew the fate of Richmann, the\r\nRussian scientist, who had been struck dead by a lightning-bolt while\r\nmaking experiments not very different, yet he dared to place a lightning\r\nconductor on the highest point of his house, and to this conductor he\r\nattached a wire, which ran down to his laboratory. During a storm, he\r\nsuspended on this metallic circuit, by means of their sciatic nerves,\r\nfrogs' legs and the legs of other animals prepared for the purpose. To\r\nthe feet of the animals he attached another Wire sufficiently long to\r\nreach down to the bottom of a well, thus grounding the circuit.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this study of the influence of lightning and large\r\nelectrical disturbances in the air on the preparation of the frog as he\r\nhad made it, Galvani set about discovering whether even the slight\r\ndifferences in electrical potential which occur during the day in\r\natmospheric electricity might not give rise, even in fair weather, to\r\ncertain contractions of the frog's muscles. He made his observations for\r\nmany days at many different hours and under varying conditions of light\r\nand shade, of heat and cold, without finding anything. There were\r\noccasional contractions, but they bore no definite relation to\r\nvariations in the atmosphere, or the electric state of the atmosphere.\r\nGalvani satisfied himself of this very thoroughly, and with a patience\r\nand diligence worthy of emulation by a Fellow at a modern university\r\nworking on a foundation for the determination of a particular question.\r\n\r\nThe third part of the work is the most important as well as the\r\nlongest, and contains the ideas which are original with Galvani, but\r\nwhich met most opposition in his time and have only been properly\r\nappreciated in recent years. Galvani came to the conclusion that there\r\nis such a thing as animal electricity. This led to a famous controversy\r\nwith Volta, in which their contemporaries judged that Galvani had the\r\nworst of it; but, as so often happens, their successors a century later\r\nwould judge that Galvani's views were more in accord with what we know\r\nat the present time. Criticism is always easier than scientific advance,\r\nand in a controversy it is usually the man who writes most forcibly,\r\nrather than the one who thinks most deeply, who secures the assent of\r\nreaders. This makes controversy in matters of science always\r\nunfortunate, for it does much more to retard than to help scientific\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nGalvani insists, at the end of this chapter on animal electricity, that\r\nwhat he writes is entirely the result of experiment, and that he has\r\ntried in every way to make his experiments from a thoroughly critical\r\nstandpoint. Those who repeat his observations will find this to be true,\r\nthough he confesses that there are times when conditions not well\r\nunderstood seem to hinder the results that he usually obtained.\r\n\r\nThe fourth part of his commentary is taken up with certain conjectures,\r\nas he calls them, and some conclusions from his work. In this he\r\nsuggests the use of electricity for the cure of certain nervous\r\ndiseases, and especially for the treatment of the various forms of\r\nparalysis. The use of electricity for these cases had been previously\r\nsuggested, and Bertholinus had told the story of patients who were\r\nutterly unable to move and who had recovered after having been in the\r\nneighborhood where a lightning-bolt had struck. To the minds of\r\nphysicians of that time, this must have seemed proof positive of the\r\ncurative value of lightning, and, therefore, of electricity, for\r\nparalytic conditions. The remedy was heroic, if not indeed positively\r\nrisky, but its good effect could not be doubted. Unfortunately, as is\r\nalways true in medical matters, the real question at issue in these\r\ncases is not so much the value of the remedy as the propriety of the\r\ndiagnosis. Paralysis, in the sense of inability to use one or more\r\nlimbs, may be due to many causes. There are a number of forms of\r\nfunctional or hysterical palsy, that is, of incapacity to use certain\r\ngroups of muscles not dependent on any organic lesion, but upon some\r\ncurious state of the nervous system which may pass away entirely, and\r\nwhich, indeed, seem to be dependent on the patient's state of mind. A\r\nnumber of so-called paralytic patients were cured by the earthquake in\r\nSan Francisco; some are made to do the apparently impossible every year;\r\nthey get up and walk because of the shock due to a fire or burglars. We\r\nknow now that the electrical status of the individual is very carefully\r\nprotected from disturbance by external electrical forces. What Galvani\r\nbegan has borne fruit in diagnosis more than treatment, so that his\r\nprophecy has been amply fulfilled. \"The application of this method may\r\nthrow light on the subject and experience may help us to understand it.\"\r\n\r\nAmong his conclusions, Galvani hints that electricity may not only\r\nproceed from the clouds during electrical disturbances, but also may\r\nproceed from the earth itself, and that living beings may be affected by\r\nthis. He suggests, therefore, that plants and animals may be influenced\r\nin their growth and in their health by such electrical changes. He adds\r\nthe suggestion that there may be some intimate connection between\r\nelectrical phenomena and earthquakes, and suggests that, in countries\r\nwhere earthquakes are frequent, observations should be made by means of\r\nfrogs' limbs in order to see whether there may not be some definite\r\nchange in the electrical conditions of the atmosphere before and during\r\nthe earthquake. He seems to have had some idea that the curious feelings\r\nwhich at times come before an earthquake to human beings, though they\r\nseem even more noticeable in animals, may be due to this change in\r\natmospheric electricity.[13]\r\n\r\nWe are rather prone to think that news of scientific discoveries\r\ntraveled slowly in Europe in the eighteenth century. There is abundant\r\nevidence of the contrary in these sketches of electricians, and\r\nGalvani's case is one of the most striking. How much attention Galvani's\r\ndiscovery attracted and how soon definite details of it spread to the\r\nother end of Europe may be judged from the fact that, in 1793, Mr.\r\nRichard Fowler published a small book at Edinburgh bearing the title,\r\nExperiments and Observations Relative to the Influence Lately\r\nDiscovered by M. Galvani, and commonly called Animal Electricity.[15]\r\nThis little book, which may be seen at the Surgeons General Library,\r\nWashington, and in the Library of the American Institute of Electrical\r\nEngineers, New York, details a large number of experiments that Fowler\r\nhad made during the preceding year or more, so that Galvani's work must\r\nhave reached him within a few months after its publication. Fowler\r\nmentions the fact that Galvani had been occupied many years before this\r\nin the study of electric fishes, especially the _torpedo_, the\r\n_gymnotus electricus_ and _silurus electricus_. He also mentions a\r\ncurious observation of Cotugno, who, a few years before, had received a\r\nshock from a mouse while dissecting the little animal, which makes it\r\nclear that imagination played a role in helping to the introduction of\r\nthe newer ideas with regard to animal electricity.[16]\r\n\r\nBut before his discovery was to attract so much attention, Galvani had\r\nto work it out, and this is the merit of the man.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to say, these experiments upon frogs were not\r\naccomplished in a few days or a few weeks. Galvani had his duties as\r\nProfessor of Anatomy to attend to besides the obligations imposed upon\r\nhim as a busy practitioner of medicine and surgery. At that time, it was\r\nnot nearly so much the custom as it is at the present, to use frogs for\r\nexperiments, with the idea that conclusions might be obtained of value\r\nfor the biological sciences generally, and especially for medicine.\r\nThere has always been such an undercurrent of feeling, that such\r\nexperiments have been more or less a beating of the air. Galvani found\r\nthis opposition not only to his views with regard to animal electricity\r\nas enunciated after experimental demonstration, but also met with no\r\nlittle ridicule because of the supposed waste of time at occupations\r\nthat could not be expected to lead to any practical results. It was the\r\ncustom of scientific men to laugh somewhat scornfully at his patient\r\npersistence in studying out every detail of electrical action on the\r\nfrog, and one of the supposedly prominent scientists of the time even\r\ndubbed him \"the frog dancing master.\" This did not, however, deter\r\nGalvani from his work, though some of the bitter things must have proved\r\ncutting enough, and might have discouraged a smaller man, less confident\r\nof the scientific value of the work that he was doing.\r\n\r\nHis relations with his patients--for during all of his career he\r\ncontinued to practice, especially surgery and obstetrics--were of the\r\nfriendliest character. While his distinction as a professor at the\r\nUniversity gave him many opportunities for practice among the rich, he\r\nwas always ready and willing to help the poor, and, indeed, seemed to\r\nfeel more at home among poor patients than in the society of the wealthy\r\nand the noble. Even toward the end of his life, when the loss of many\r\nfriends, and especially his wife, made him retire within himself much\r\nmore than before, he continued to exercise his professional skill for\r\nthe benefit of the poor, though he often refused to take cases that\r\nmight have proved sources of considerable gain to him. Early in life,\r\nwhen he was very busy between his professorial work and his practice, he\r\nremarked more than once, on refusing to take the cases of wealthy\r\npatients, that they had the money with which to obtain other physicians,\r\nwhile the poor did not, and he would prefer to keep some time for his\r\nservices to them. When ailing and miserable toward the end of his life,\r\nhe still continued his practice, and was especially ready to spend his\r\ntime with the poor. He was dying himself, as one of his biographers\r\nsays, when he got up from a sick bed to see a dying woman who sent for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe was one of the most popular professors that the University of Bologna\r\never had. He was not, in the ordinary sense of the word, an orator, but\r\nhe was a born teacher. The source of the enthusiasm which he aroused in\r\nhis hearers was undoubtedly his own love for teaching and the power it\r\ngave him to express even intricate problems in simple, straightforward\r\nlanguage. More than any of his colleagues, he understood that\r\nexperiments and demonstrations must be the real groundwork of the\r\nteaching of science. Accordingly, very few of his lectures were given\r\nwithout the aid of these material helps to attract attention. Besides,\r\nhe was known to be one who delighted to answer questions, and was\r\nperfectly frank about the limitations of his knowledge whenever there\r\nwas no real answer to be given to a question that had been proposed.\r\nThough an original discoverer of the first rank, he was extremely\r\nmodest, particularly when talking about the details of his discoveries\r\nor subjects relating to them.\r\n\r\nGalvani was not a good talker, though he seems to have been a good\r\nteacher. He had little of that facility which wins friends easily and\r\nenables a man to shine with a borrowed lustre of knowledge, often enough\r\nquite superficial. What he said was almost sure to have a very serious\r\nmeaning. While there is no doubt that Galvani was a genius, in the sense\r\nthat he was one of the precious few who take the step across the\r\nboundary of the unknown and make a path along which it is easy for\r\nothers to follow in reaching hitherto trackless regions in human\r\nspeculation, he also had what is undoubtedly the main element in talent,\r\nfor he was possessed to a high degree of the faculty for hard work. For\r\nthis he regulated the hours of his labor very carefully. Only thus could\r\nhe have accomplished what he did. It must not be forgotten that he was\r\nteaching anatomy and obstetrics at the University of Bologna, and,\r\nsurprising as it may seem, doing both these tasks well. He was besides\r\naccomplishing good work in comparative anatomy and physiology by\r\noriginal investigations of a high order. In spite of all this, which\r\nwould seem occupation enough and more for any one man, he was able to\r\nkeep up a rather demanding practice.\r\n\r\nHe did not have many friends, but those whom he admitted to his intimacy\r\nwere bound to him with the proverbial hoops of steel. With two men in\r\nBologna he spent most of his leisure. They were Dr. Julio Cæsare\r\nCingari, a distinguished physician of the city, and the well-known\r\nastronomer who held the chair of astronomy at the University, Francisco\r\nSacchetti. With these he passed many a pleasant hour, and week after\r\nweek they met at one another's houses to discuss scientific questions\r\nand the lighter topics of the day. Galvani was thoroughly respected by\r\nall the members of the Faculty at Bologna, though he did not seek many\r\nfriendships, and indeed probably would have more or less resented the\r\nintrusions of acquaintances, because of the time that it would take from\r\nhim. He was a very retiring man, caring not at all for social things,\r\nand least of all for that personal fame which has been so well defined\r\nas the being known by those whom one does not know. His happiness in\r\nlife came to him from his work and from his domestic relations. His wife\r\nwas one of those marvelous women, rarer than they should be, one is\r\ntempted to say, who are enough interested in their husband's\r\nintellectual work to add to the zest of discovery in the discussion of\r\nit with them, and who yet realize that it is by minimizing the little\r\nworries of life that they can best help their husbands.\r\n\r\nA very interesting phase of the Italian University life of that time is\r\nrevealed in two important incidents of Galvani's university career. One\r\nof his professors--one, by the way, for whom he seems to have had a\r\ngreat deal of respect, and to whose lectures he devoted much attention,\r\nwas Laura Caterina Maria Bassi, the distinguished woman Professor of\r\nPhilosophy at the University of Bologna, about the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. It is doubtless to her teaching that Galvani owes\r\nsome of his thorough-going conservatism in philosophic speculation, a\r\nconservatism that was of great service to him later on in life, in the\r\nmidst of the ultra-radical principles which became fashionable just\r\nbefore and during the French Revolution. Madame Bassi seems to have had\r\nher influence on him for good not only during his student career, but\r\nalso later in life, for she was the wife of a prominent physician in\r\nBologna, and Galvani was often in social contact with her during her\r\nyears of connection with the University.\r\n\r\nAs might, perhaps, be expected, seeing that his own happy domestic life\r\nshowed him that an educated woman might be the center of intellectual\r\ninfluence, Galvani seems to have had no spirit of opposition to even the\r\nhighest education for women. This is very well illustrated by the first\r\nformal lecture in his course on anatomy at the University, which had for\r\nits subject the models for the teaching of anatomy that had been made by\r\nMadame Manzolini.[12] In the early part of the eighteenth century,\r\nMadame Manzolini had been the Professor of Anatomy at the University of\r\nBologna, and in order to make the teaching of this difficult subject\r\neasier and more definite, she modeled with great care and delicate\r\nattention to every detail, so that they imitated actual dissections of\r\nthe human body very closely, a set of wax figures, which replaced the\r\nhuman body for demonstration purposes, at least at the beginning of the\r\nanatomical course.\r\n\r\nGalvani, in taking up the work of lecturer in anatomy, appreciated how\r\nmuch such a set of models would serve to make the introduction to\r\nanatomical study easy, yet at the same time without diminishing its\r\nexactness, and accordingly introduced his students to Madame Manzolini's\r\nset of models in his very first lecture. At the time, not a few of the\r\nteachers of anatomy at the Italian universities were inclined to\r\nconsider the use of these models as rather an effeminate proceeding.\r\nGalvani's lack of prejudice in the matter shows the readiness of the man\r\nto accept the best, wherever he found it, without regard to persons or\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nGalvani's personal character was very pleasant, yet rather grave and\r\nserious. His panegyrist, Professor Giuseppe Venturoli, in the eulogium\r\nof Galvani, delivered in the Public Academy of the Institute of Bologna\r\n(1802) within five years after Galvani's death, says that Galvani was\r\nfar from that coldness or lack of interest which sometimes characterizes\r\nscientists in their social relations, and which, as he naïvely says, is\r\nsometimes praised and sometimes blamed by those who write about them.\r\nAnother side of Galvani's character is more interesting. He was ready to\r\ndo all in his power for the poor. He conducted his obstetrical clinic\r\nparticularly with a liberal benevolence and charity that deserve to be\r\nmentioned. When it is considered how much time his teaching and his\r\ncharity took from him, it is rather surprising to find that he had\r\nenough left to enable him to devote himself with so much success to the\r\ndifficult tasks he set himself in research and to the time-taking labors\r\nof controversy, which occupied many years after the announcement of his\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nThe most striking proof of the thorough conscientiousness with which he\r\nfaced the duties of life is to be found in his conduct after the\r\nestablishment of the so-called Cis-Alpine Republic in Italy. This was a\r\ngovernment established merely by force of arms, maintained through\r\nFrench influence, without the consent of the people, and a plain\r\nusurpation of the rights of the previous government. Galvani considered\r\nhimself bound in duty to the authority under which he had lived all his\r\nprevious life and to which he had sworn fealty. When the University of\r\nBologna was reorganized under the new government, the first requirement\r\nof all those who were made professors was that they should take the oath\r\nof allegiance to the new government. This he refused to do. His motives\r\ncan be readily understood, and though practically all the other\r\nprofessors of the University had taken the oath, he did not consider\r\nthat this freed him from his conscientious obligations in the matter.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he was dropped from the roll of professors and deprived of\r\nthe never very large salary which he had obtained from this chair. On\r\nthis sum he had practically depended for his existence, and he began to\r\nsuffer from want. While he had been a successful practitioner of\r\nmedicine, especially of surgery, he had always been very liberal, and\r\nhad spent large sums of money in demonstrations for his lectures and\r\npersonal experimentation and in materials for the museums of the\r\nUniversity. He began to suffer from actual want, and friends had to come\r\nto his assistance. He refused, however, to give up his scruples in the\r\nmatter and accept the professorship which was still open to him.\r\nFinally, at the end of two years, influence was brought to bear on the\r\nnew government, and Galvani was allowed to accept his chair in the\r\nUniversity without taking the oath of allegiance. This tribute came too\r\nlate, however, and within a short time after his restoration to his\r\nprofessorship he died.\r\n\r\nGalvani's conduct in this affair is the key-note to his character and\r\nconduct through life. For him duty was the paramount word, and success\r\nmeant the accomplishment of duty. For getting on in the world and\r\nmaterial rewards he had no use unless they came as the consequence of\r\nduty fulfilled. His action in the matter of the University professorship\r\nhas of course been much discussed by his biographers.\r\n\r\nHis eulogist, Professor Venturoli, whom we have already quoted, and\r\nwhose eulogium is to be found in the complete edition of Galvani's works\r\nissued at Bologna in 1841,[11] has much to say with regard to Galvani's\r\nreligious sentiments.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"The great founder in electricity was deeply religious, and his\r\npiety clothed a heart that was not less affectionate and sensitive to\r\naffection than it was intrepid and courageous. When called upon to take\r\nthe civic oath in a formula involved in ambiguous words, he did not\r\nbelieve that he ought, on so serious an occasion, to permit himself\r\nanything but the clear and precise expression of his sentiments, full as\r\nthey were of honesty and rectitude. Refusing to take advantage of the\r\nsuggestion that he should modify the oath by some declaration apart from\r\nthe prescribed formula, though it might still be generally understood\r\nthat he had taken the oath, he refused constantly to commit himself to\r\nany such subterfuge. It is not our duty here to ask whether his\r\nconclusion was correct or not. He followed the voice of his conscience,\r\nwhich ever must be the standard of duty, and it certainly would have\r\nbeen a fault to have deviated from it. It is sad to think that this\r\ngreat man, deprived of his position, saw himself, for an instant at\r\nleast, exposed to the danger of ending his career, deprived of the\r\nrecompense which he so richly deserved and to which his past services to\r\nthe State and the University had given him so just a title. This is all\r\nthe more sad when we realize that the vicissitudes of his delicate\r\nhealth, much more than his age, now rendered such recompense doubly\r\nnecessary. It is a gracious thing to recall, however, the noble firmness\r\nwith which he maintained himself against so serious a blow. His courage\r\nis all the more admirable as one can see how absolutely without\r\naffectation it is. He was not ostentatious in his goodness, and did not\r\npermit himself to be cast down by the unfortunate conditions, but\r\nconstantly preserved in the midst of adverse fortune that modest,\r\nimperturbable and dignified conduct which had always characterized him\r\nin the midst of his prosperity and his glory.\"\r\n\r\nThat his action in this matter was very properly appreciated by his\r\ncontemporaries, and that the moral influence of his example was not\r\nlost, can be realized from the expressions used by Alibert, the\r\nSecretary-General of the Medical Society of Emulation, in the historical\r\naddress on Galvani which he delivered before that society in Paris in\r\n1801:\r\n\r\n\"Galvani constantly refused to take the civil oath demanded by the\r\ndecrees of the Cis-Alpine Republic. Who can blame him for having\r\nfollowed the voice of his conscience--that sacred, interior voice which\r\nalone prescribes the duties of man and which has preceded all human\r\nlaws? Who could not praise him for having sacrificed all such exemplary\r\nresignation, all the emoluments of his professorship, rather than\r\nviolate the solemn engagements made under religious sanction?\"\r\n\r\nIn the same panegyric there is a very curiously interesting passage with\r\nregard to Galvani's habit of frequently closing his lectures by calling\r\nattention to the complexity yet the purposefulness of natural things,\r\nand the inevitable conclusion that they must have been created with a\r\ndefinite purpose by a Supreme Being possessed of intelligence. At the\r\ntime that Alibert wrote his memoir, it was the fashion to consider, at\r\nleast in France, that Christianity was a thing of the past, and that\r\nwhile theism might remain, that would be all that could be expected to\r\nsurvive the crumbling effect of the emancipation of man.\r\n\r\nHe says: \"We have seen already what was Galvani's zeal and his love for\r\nthe religion which he professed. We may add that, in his public\r\ndemonstrations, he never finished his lectures without exhorting his\r\npupils to a renewal of their faith, by leading them always back to the\r\nidea of the eternal Providence which develops, preserves and causes life\r\nto flow among so many different kinds of things. I write now,\" he\r\ncontinues, \"in the age of reason, of tolerance and of light. Must I then\r\ndefend Galvani in the eyes of posterity for one of the most beautiful\r\nsentiments that can spring from the nature of man? No; and they are but\r\nlittle initiated in the saner mechanism of philosophy who refuse to\r\nrecognize the truths established on evidence so strong and so authentic.\r\n_Breves haustus in philosophia ad atheismum ducunt, longiores autem\r\nreducunt ad Deum_--Small draughts of philosophy lead to atheism, but\r\nlonger draughts bring one back to God\"--(which may be better translated,\r\nperhaps, for English readers by Pope's well known lines, \"A little\r\nlearning [in philosophy] is a dangerous thing; drink deep or touch not\r\nthe Pierian spring\").\r\n\r\nGalvani has been honored by his fellow-citizens of Bologna as one of\r\ntheir greatest townsmen, and by the University as one of her worthiest\r\nsons. In 1804, a medal was struck in his honor, on the reverse of which,\r\nsurrounding a figure of the genius of science, were the two legends:\r\n\"Mors mihi vita,\" \"Death is life for me,\" and \"Spiritus intus alit,\"\r\n\"The spirit works within,\" which were favorite expressions of the great\r\nscientist while living, and are lively symbols of the spirit which\r\nanimated him. In 1814, a monument was erected to him in the courtyard of\r\nthe University of Bologna. It is surmounted by his bust, made by the\r\nmost distinguished Bolognian sculptor of the time, De Maria. On the\r\npedestal there are two figures in bas-relief, executed by the same\r\nsculptor, which represent religion and philosophy, the inspiring genius\r\nof Galvani's life.\r\n\r\nBefore he died, he asked, as had his favorite poet Dante, whose Divina\r\nCommedia had been one of the pleasures of life and above all one of the\r\nconsolations of his times of adversity, to be buried in the humble habit\r\nof a member of the Third Order of St. Francis. He is said to have valued\r\nhis fellowship with the sons of the \"poor little man of Assisi\" more\r\nthan the many honorary fellowships of various kinds which had been\r\nconferred upon him by scientific societies all over Europe. With him\r\npassed away one of the great pioneers of modern science and one of the\r\nmost lovable men in all the history of science. His death took place\r\njust before the close of the eighteen century, Dec. 4, 1798, but his\r\nwork was destined to be one of the harbingers of a great period of\r\nelectrical development.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Fordham University Press, 1906.\r\n\r\n[12] Ranam dissecui, atque praeparavi ut in fig. 2 Tab.

Its directors were\r\nthe brothers Themistocles and Ulysses Santopadre.

This thesis serves to show that\r\nGalvani's work was already attracting the attention even of the most\r\ndistant of Western Universities.\r\n\r\n[17] It is interesting to note that the two successful\r\ninventions for lessening the necessity for deterrent dissecting work are\r\ndue to women--Professor Manzolini and her wax models, and Alessandra\r\nGiliani, the assistant of Mondino, Father of Dissection, (d. 1320), who\r\nknew how \"to fill the veins with various colored fluids which would\r\nharden, and paint these same vessels and color them so naturally that\r\nthey brought Mondino great fame and credit.\" (Old Chronicler.)\r\n\r\n[18] Opere Edite ed Inedite del Professore Luigi Galvani\r\nRaccolte e Pubblicate Per Cura Dell'Accademia Delle Scienze\r\nDell'Instituto Di Bologna, Bologna Tipografia Di Emilio Dall'Olmo.\r\nMDCCCXLI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nVOLTA THE FOUNDER OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the end of the eighteenth century, discoverers in electrical\r\nscience had usually been students of science in other departments, whose\r\nattention to electricity had been attracted in passing as it were.\r\nOccasionally, indeed, they had been only interested amateurs,\r\ninquisitive as to the curious phenomena of magnetism. It is surprising\r\nhow many of these pioneers in electricity were clergymen, though that\r\nfact is seldom realized. It can be seen very readily in my chapter on\r\nClergymen Pioneers in Electricity, in Catholic Churchmen in Science\r\n(Second Series, Dolphin Press, Phila., 1909). With Volta's career,\r\nhowever, was initiated the story of the electrical scientists who\r\ndevoted themselves almost exclusively to this department of physics,\r\nthough more or less necessarily paying some attention to related\r\nsubjects. Volta's discovery of a practical instrument for measuring\r\nelectricity, as well as of comparatively simple apparatus producing a\r\ncontinuous current, changed the whole face of the science of\r\nelectricity. After these inventions, regular work could be readily done\r\nin the investigation of problems in the science of electricity without\r\ndiscouragement or inadequate instruments, discontinuous electrical\r\nphenomena, disturbances of experiments by the weather, and other\r\nconditions which had been hitherto so unfavorable to electrical\r\nexperimentation. Volta's invention of the pile, or battery, so\r\ndeservedly called after him, caused electrical science to take on an\r\nentirely new aspect, and the modern development of electricity was\r\nassured. It has been well said that no other invention, not even the\r\nsteam-engine, meant so much for the transformation of modern life as\r\nthis new apparatus for the production of a continuous electric current.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ALESSANDRO VOLTA]\r\n\r\nThe man who worked this revolution in electrical science was no mere\r\ninventor who, by a happy chance, brought together practical factors that\r\nhad been well known before but had never been combined. He was one of\r\nthe greatest scientists of a period particularly rich in examples of\r\noriginal scientific genius of a high order. Before his death, he came to\r\nbe acknowledged by the scientific world of his time as one of the\r\ngreatest leaders of thought, not alone in electricity, but in all\r\ndepartments of the physical sciences. His life forms for this reason an\r\nimportant chapter in the history of science and scientific development.\r\n\r\nLike most of the distinguished scientific discoverers of the last two\r\ncenturies, Alessandro Volta was born in very humble circumstances. His\r\nfather was a member of the Italian nobility, but had wasted his\r\npatrimony so completely that the family was in extreme poverty when the\r\ndistinguished son was born, on the eighteenth of February, 1745. This\r\npoverty was so complete that Volta said of it, later in life: \"My father\r\nowned nothing except a small dwelling worth about fourteen thousand\r\nlire; and as he left behind him seventeen thousand lire of debt, I\r\nwas actually poorer than poor.\" A good idea of the circumstances in\r\nwhich Volta's childhood was passed may be gathered from the fact that he\r\ncould not even secure copy-books for his first school exercises except\r\nthrough the kindness of friends.\r\n\r\nVolta had shown signs of genius from early boyhood, and yet had been\r\ndiscouragingly slow in his intellectual development as a child. In fact,\r\nit was feared that he was congenitally lacking in intelligence to a\r\ngreat degree. It is said that he was more than four years old before he\r\never uttered a word. This does not mean before he learned to talk\r\nconnectedly, but before he could utter even such familiar expressions as\r\n\"father,\" \"mother,\" and the like. He was considered to be dumb; and, as\r\nis not infrequently the mistaken notion with regard to children dumb for\r\nany reason, he was thought to be almost an idiot. The first word he ever\r\nuttered is said to have been a vigorous \"No!\" which was heard when one\r\nof his relatives insisted on his doing something that he did not wish to\r\ndo. At the age of seven, however, he had so far overcome all\r\ndifficulties of speech as to be looked upon as a very bright child.\r\nOwing to this late, unexpected development, his parents seem to have\r\nregarded him as a sort of living miracle, and felt certain that he was\r\ndestined to accomplish great things. His father said of him later, \"We\r\nhad a jewel in the house and did not know it.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately for Volta, one of his uncles was archdeacon of the\r\nCathedral, and another was one of the canons. These relatives helped him\r\nto obtain an education, the way being made especially easy by the fact\r\nthat at this time all the Jesuit Colleges subsisted on foundations and\r\ncollected no fees from any of their students; so that all that was\r\nnecessary for his uncles to do for him was to contribute to his expenses\r\noutside of college. According to tradition, the Jesuits not only helped\r\nVolta in his education, but assisted him in obtaining his books and\r\neven in his living expenses while at their college. At the age of about\r\nsixteen, his education was complete, even including a year of\r\nphilosophy. This is probably an indication of his talent as a student;\r\nthough it was not an unusual thing in the southern countries for\r\nstudents to graduate at sixteen, or even younger, after a course\r\nequivalent to that now required for the bachelor's degree in arts.\r\n\r\nWe have gotten far away from this early graduation, although it is still\r\nsometimes possible in Italian universities; and one of the brightest men\r\nI ever knew was an Italian who had graduated with a degree equivalent to\r\nour A. B. before he was sixteen. When Volta graduated, however, such\r\nearly completion of the undergraduate course was not at all unusual in\r\nItaly, and boys of thirteen and fourteen, almost as a rule, entered the\r\nundergraduate department to complete their course for a degree at\r\nseventeen or eighteen. One of our greatest physicians in this country,\r\nBenjamin Rush, was only seventeen when he completed his college course,\r\nand such examples were not at all rare. Indeed, the possibility for\r\nthese men to devote themselves much earlier than is possible now to\r\ntheir serious life-work, yet with the development of mind which comes\r\nfrom a University course in the arts, was probably a distinct help to\r\nthe success of their scientific careers. One is tempted to think that\r\npossibly such justification of earlier graduation, as we find among the\r\ndistinguished scientists of a century ago, might make us reflect deeply\r\nbefore lending ourselves to what Herbert Spencer thought a phase of\r\nevolution, the lengthening of childhood, for it is just possible that\r\nthe earlier recognition of manhood may mean more for individual\r\ndevelopment. Of course, geniuses are exceptions to rule, and an\r\nargument founded on their careers may mean very little for the\r\ngenerality of students.\r\n\r\nLike many another of the great scientists, Volta was not that constant\r\nsource of satisfaction to his teachers while at school that might\r\npossibly be expected. He had little interest in the conventional\r\nelementary education of the time, he was frequently distracted during\r\nschool hours, and even as a mere boy often asked questions with regard\r\nto natural phenomena that were puzzlers to his masters, and sometimes\r\ncomplained of their lack of knowledge. He fortunately outgrew this\r\npriggishness, for in later childhood he seems to have been one of those\r\ntalented children who learn rapidly and who are impatient at being kept\r\nback while their slower fellow-pupils are having drilled into them what\r\ncame so easy to readier talents.\r\n\r\nIn his classical studies, however, Volta was deeply interested. He was\r\nespecially enthusiastic over poetry, and at school devoted the spare\r\ntime that his readiness of acquisition left him to the reading of Virgil\r\nand Tasso. These favorite authors became so familiar to him that he\r\ncould repeat much of them by heart, and even in old age could cap verses\r\nfrom them better than any of his friends, even those all of whose lives\r\nhad been devoted exclusively to literary occupations. During his walks,\r\nwhen an old man, he often entertained himself by repeating long passages\r\nfrom the classic Latin and Italian poets.\r\n\r\nEven at this time, Volta's interest in the physical sciences was very\r\nmarked. There is still extant a Latin poem of about five hundred verses,\r\nin which he sets forth the observations of Priestley, the discoverer of\r\noxygen, whom it used to be the custom to call the Father of Modern\r\nChemistry. This poem shows his thorough familiarity with the work of the\r\ngreat English investigator. Volta's model was Lucretius. Lest it should\r\nbe a source of surprise that an Italian scientist had recourse to Latin\r\nfor even a poetic account of scientific discoveries, it may be well to\r\nrecall that Latin was still the universal language of science at that\r\ntime, and Volta's great contemporary in electricity, Galvani, wrote his\r\noriginal monograph on animal electricity in that language, and even the\r\nFather of Pathology wrote his first great treatise, De Causis et Sedibus\r\nMorborum, in that tongue. As to his adoption of verse as a vehicle for\r\nscientific writing, it must not be forgotten that, at the time when\r\nVolta was writing his poem, another distinguished writer on scientific\r\nsubjects, Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin of the last\r\ngeneration, was composing his \"Zoonomia; or, Animal Biography,\" in\r\nEnglish verse. Didactic verse was quite the fashion of the time, and\r\nsome of it, even when it came from acknowledged poets, had not more\r\npoetry than Volta's effusion.\r\n\r\nAs if to make up for his lack of linguistic faculty when young, Volta\r\nseems to have had a special gift for languages when he grew older.\r\nBefore the age of twenty, he knew French as well as his mother tongue,\r\nread German and English fluently, and Low Dutch and Spanish were not\r\nbeyond his comprehension. Besides his verses in Latin he wrote poetry\r\nalso in French and Italian, always with cleverness at least, and at\r\ntimes with true poetic feeling.\r\n\r\nWhile attending the Jesuit school, he expressed, it is said, a desire\r\nto enter the Order. As his father, however, had been with the Jesuits\r\nfor eleven years and had then given up his studies, his family feared a\r\nrepetition of such an experience; and so his clergymen uncles took him\r\naway from the school and sent him for a while to the Seminary at Benzi.\r\nAfter a time Volta abandoned the idea of becoming a priest, but would\r\nnot consent to follow the wishes of the family council further, at least\r\nnot to the extent of becoming a lawyer. Though he studied law for a\r\ntime, he constantly wandered away to the reading of books on the natural\r\nsciences and to the study of natural objects. Finally he was allowed to\r\ngive up law to devote himself exclusively to science.\r\n\r\nFortunately, one of the canons of the Cathedral of Como, a former\r\nfellow-student of his and a man of considerable means, was also\r\ninterested in the natural sciences, and obtained the books and\r\ninstruments necessary to enable Volta and himself to continue their\r\nstudies. Father Gattoni seems to have realized at once the possibilities\r\nfor great advances in science that lay in Volta's wonderful powers of\r\nobservation, and encouraged him in every way. As a consequence, some of\r\nthe important experiments that laid the foundation of the modern science\r\nof electricity and proved the beginning of Volta's world-wide reputation\r\nwere carried on in Gattoni's rooms.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, Volta was so completely devoted to scientific\r\ninvestigations that there could be no doubt of the bent of his genius\r\nfor original work of a high order. His power of concentration of\r\nattention on a subject was supreme. Biographers emphasize that there was\r\nno time, much less inclination, for the levities that so often appeal to\r\nthe growing youth. He was almost too staid and preoccupied with his\r\nwork for his own health and the comfort of his friends. When he became\r\ninterested in a series of experiments, he often forgot the flight of\r\ntime, and was known to miss meals, and inadvertently to put off going to\r\nbed--apparently quite unconscious of his physical necessities. This\r\nintense concentration of mind had its disadvantages. One of his friends\r\ncomplained playfully that he made a rather disagreeable traveling\r\ncompanion on account of his tendency to become abstracted; and on\r\noccasions this friend was deeply mortified to see Volta, when in\r\ncompany, take out a pocket-handkerchief that had been used for some\r\npurpose in the laboratory--which showed unmistakable signs of its\r\nprevious employment as a cleansing agent for dirty instruments or hands,\r\nthough its possessor was evidently unconscious of its appearance. More\r\nthan once, too, his handkerchief proved, when taken out for its natural\r\nuses, to be as preoccupied as its owner: specimens of rocks or natural\r\ncuriosities that he had gathered and inadvertently allowed to remain in\r\nhis pocket came with it.\r\n\r\nAll during his life he retained an unusual faculty for concentrating his\r\nattention, which at times amounted to complete abstraction from his\r\nsurroundings. It is related that, one cold morning his students at the\r\nUniversity of Pavia found him in his shirt sleeves, so intent on\r\narranging the experiments that were to illustrate his morning lecture\r\nthat he was unconscious of the time, and even did not notice their\r\ncoming into the room until they had been for some time in their seats\r\nand he had finally completed the arrangement for the demonstrations. He\r\nwas constantly occupied with problems in natural science, looking for\r\nthe explanation of phenomena that he did not understand as well as\r\ngathering new data by observation and experiment. He was gifted with\r\nthe supremely inquisitive spirit, in the scientific sense of the\r\nepithet, and could not be satisfied with accepting things as he found\r\nthem without knowing the reasons for them.\r\n\r\nVolta furnishes another excellent illustration of how soon genius gets\r\nat its life-work. We have his own authority for the fact that he had\r\ncome to certain conclusions with regard to the explanation of electrical\r\nphenomena, which, when he was only nineteen years of age, he set forth\r\nin a letter to the Abbé Nollet, who was then one of the best known\r\nexperimenters and writers on electrical phenomena in Europe. Though so\r\nyoung, Volta had tried to simplify Franklin's theory of electricity by\r\nassuming that there was an action only between a (supposed) electrical\r\nsubstance and matter. It is curious to see how much he anticipated what\r\nwas to be the thinking for more than a century after his time and\r\npractically down to the present day. He considers that all bodies, in\r\ntheir normal state, contain electricity in such proportion that\r\nelectrical equilibrium is established within them. Electrical phenomena,\r\nthen, are due to disturbances of this equilibrium. Such disturbances may\r\nbe produced by physical means, as by friction or by chemical means, and\r\neven atmospheric electricity may be explained in the former way.\r\n\r\nVolta's first formal paper on electricity, bearing the title _De Vi\r\nAttractiva Ignis Electrici_, was published in 1769, when he was\r\ntwenty-four years of age. His second paper, _Novus Ac Simplicissimus,\r\nElectricorum Tentaminum Apparatus_--New and Very Simple. Apparatus for\r\nElectrical Tests, shows that Volta was getting beyond the stage of\r\ntheorizing about electricity into the experimental work, which was to\r\nform the foundation of his contributions to electrical science. It is\r\nnot surprising, then, that when he was just past thirty, in 1775, he was\r\nable to announce to Priestley his invention of the electrophorus.\r\nPriestley is usually thought of as one of the founders of modern\r\nchemistry, but he was known to his own generation, especially at this\r\ntime, as the writer of a very interesting and complete history of\r\nelectricity. It is characteristic of Volta's careful ways, that the\r\nreason for his letter to Priestley was in order to obtain information\r\nfrom him as to what extent this invention, which Volta knew, as far as\r\nhe was concerned, to be original with himself, was novel in the domain\r\nof electrical advance.[20]\r\n\r\nWith the intense interest in his work that we have noted, it is not\r\nsurprising to find Volta's investigations proving fruitful. His active\r\ninventive genius stood him in good stead in enabling him to demonstrate\r\nprinciples by working instruments. The electrophorus is but one of the\r\ninstruments that show the very practical character of the man. He was\r\nespecially taken with the idea of securing some method of measuring\r\nelectricity. Among other things, he invented the condensing\r\nelectroscope, in which, instead of the ribbons of gold leaf now\r\nemployed, he used straws. With this instrument he was able to\r\ndemonstrate the presence of minute quantities of electricity developed\r\nunder circumstances in which ordinarily the occurrence of any such\r\nphenomena would be unsuspected. These two instruments, the electroscope\r\nand the electrophorus, lifted the department of electricity out of the\r\nrealm of theory into that of accurate scientific demonstration, and\r\nmade the electrical departments of the physical laboratories of the time\r\nmuch more interesting and important than they had been before.\r\n\r\nThough so early occupied with electricity, Volta did not confine himself\r\nto this subject, nor even to the wider field of physics, and that he did\r\nnot hesitate, in his scientific inquisitiveness, to follow clues even in\r\nchemistry, is well illustrated by his first step in the investigation of\r\ngases. His attention being called to bubbles breaking on the surface of\r\nLake Maggiore while on a fishing excursion, he set about finding their\r\nsource, and noted that whenever the bottom of the lake near the shore\r\nwas stirred somewhat a number of bubbles arose, and that the gas thus\r\nset free was inflammable. He constructed an electrical pistol in which\r\ngases thus set free were exploded by a spark from the electrophorus.\r\nAbout the same time, on the principle of the electrical pistol, he\r\ninvented the eudiometer, an apparatus by means of which the oxygen\r\ncontent of air could be determined.\r\n\r\nWith regard to these inventions, Arago calls attention to a special\r\nquality that is peculiar to all of Volta's work. \"There is not a single\r\none of the discoveries of Professor Volta,\" says the distinguished\r\nFrench scientist, \"which can be said to be the result of chance. Every\r\ninstrument with which he has enriched science existed in principle in\r\nhis imagination before an artisan began to put it into a material\r\nshape.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these inventions and his previous work, it is not surprising that\r\nin 1774 Volta was offered the professorship of experimental physics in\r\nthe College of Como. Here he labored for five years, until he received\r\na call, in 1779, to the professorship of physics at the University of\r\nPavia, where he was destined to remain in an active teaching capacity\r\nfor a period of forty years.\r\n\r\nVolta began his life-work as professor of physics at Pavia by extending\r\nhis observations on gases. He was the first to demonstrate the expansion\r\nof gases under heat, especially as regards their increased expansibility\r\nat higher temperatures. Many observers had been at work on this problem\r\nbefore his time, but there were serious discrepancies in the results\r\nreported. Volta was the first to point out the reasons for the apparent\r\ninconsistencies of previous investigators' findings; and from his\r\nobservations alone some valuable data might have been obtained for the\r\nestablishment of what has since become known as the \"law of Charles.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time, his knowledge of English enabled him to follow English\r\ndiscoveries closely, and he seems to have paid particular attention to\r\nthe work of Cavendish and Priestley. Not long after Cavendish's\r\ndescription of the method of obtaining pure hydrogen, Volta made a\r\nseries of observations on the relations of spongy platinum to this gas,\r\nand pointed out the spontaneous ignition that takes place when the two\r\nsubstances are brought together. This experiment is the basis of what\r\nhas since been known as the hydrogen lamp, called, from the German\r\nobserver who first made it a practical instrument, Dobereiner's lamp.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years of teaching, Volta was given the opportunity to visit\r\nvarious parts of Europe, and took advantage of the occasion to meet most\r\nof the celebrated men of science. His linguistic faculty stood him in\r\ngood stead during this sabbatical year, and his travel aided him in\r\ncompleting a thorough acquaintanceship with European languages as well\r\nas with scientists. His practical character led him, during his trip, to\r\nnote the growth of the potato and its uses in various European\r\ncountries, and he brought the plant home with him to Italy in order to\r\nintroduce it among the farmers. He succeeded in making his countrymen\r\nrealize its value, and the introduction of the potato is one of the\r\nreasons for which Italians have always looked up to him as a benefactor\r\nof his native land. How modern this makes a vegetable we are inclined to\r\nthink of as having been always an important food resource of the race!\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the third quarter of the eighteenth century, by one\r\nof the fortunate accidents that happen, however, only to genius,\r\nGalvani, at the time Professor of anatomy in Bologna, had been led to\r\nmake the observation that if a frog, so prepared that its hind leg is\r\nattached to the trunk only by means of the sciatic nerve, happens to be\r\ntouched by a metal instrument in such a way as to put nerve and muscle\r\nin connection with each other through the metal instrument, a very\r\ncurious phenomenon is observed, the muscles of the almost severed leg\r\nbecoming spasmodically contracted and then relaxed whenever the contacts\r\nwere made and broken. Galvani noted the phenomenon first in connection\r\nwith an electric machine, and looked for an explanation of it in\r\nelectricity, thinking that there was an analogy between it and the\r\ndischarge of the Leyden jar. After several years of careful observation,\r\nhe published a monograph on the subject, which at once attracted\r\nattention all over Europe.\r\n\r\nVolta was very much interested in Galvani's work, and took up the\r\ndevelopment of it from the physical side. At first he agreed with the\r\nexplanation offered by Galvani, who considered that his experiment\r\ndemonstrated the presence of electricity in animal bodies, and who\r\nproposed to introduce the term \"animal electricity.\" After careful\r\ninvestigation, however, Galvani's assertion that animal electricity\r\nexisted in a form entirely independent of any external electricity,\r\nthough it had been accepted by most of the distinguished men of science\r\nof the time, seemed to Volta without experimental verification. For many\r\nyears his most determined efforts were used to demonstrate that the\r\nmuscle twitchings observed were not due to the presence of animal\r\nelectricity (galvanism as it had come to be called), but to the fact\r\nthat the metals touching the different portions of the moist nerve\r\nmuscle preparation really set up minute currents of ordinary\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nSome of the experiments which he devised for this purpose were extremely\r\ningenious, and show how thoroughly empirical were his methods and how\r\nmodern his scientific spirit. In the course of his experiments he found\r\nthat a difference in the metals of which the arc was composed, when used\r\nfor the purpose of eliciting the so-called animal electricity, made a\r\ngreat difference in the electrical phenomena observed and in the amount\r\nof muscle twitchings obtained. In one brilliant series of experiments,\r\nmoreover, he showed that, even when the metallic portions touching nerve\r\nand muscle were identical, there might still be distinct electrical\r\nphenomena, if only an artificial difference in temperature of the end of\r\nthe metallic arc were produced. Volta was even able to demonstrate that\r\nsuch minute physical differences as the filing of one end of the\r\nmetallic arc used might give rise to small currents of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these experiments, he came to the realization that two\r\nportions of metal of different kinds, separated by a moist\r\nnon-conducting material, might be made to produce a constant current of\r\nelectricity for some time. More than this, however, he found that discs\r\nof metal of different kinds might be piled on top of one another with\r\nintervening discs of moist cloth, and so produce proportionately\r\nstronger currents as more and more of the metal plates were employed.\r\nThis was the origin of the voltaic pile, as it has been called--the\r\nfirst battery for the production at will of regular currents of\r\nelectricity of definite strength.[19]\r\n\r\nWhile engaged at this he succeeded in demonstrating what has come to be\r\nknown as Volta's basic experiment; namely, that two plates of metal of\r\ndifferent kinds become electrically excited merely by contact. This was\r\npractically the beginning of the great advance in applied electricity\r\nwhich ushered in our modern electrical era. It seems a simple matter\r\nnow, looking back over the century that has elapsed since then, to have\r\ntaken the successive steps that Volta did for the construction of his\r\nelectrical pile and for the demonstration of the principle of contact\r\nelectricity. Groping, as he was, in the dark, however, it took him three\r\nyears to make the progress that we have described in a few words. How\r\ngreat his discoveries appeared, even to the most distinguished of his\r\nscientific contemporaries, can best be judged from an expression of one\r\nof the greatest of French electrical scientists, Arago, who declared\r\n\"Volta's pile the most wonderful instrument that has ever come from the\r\nhand of man, not excluding even the telescope or the steam-engine.\"\r\n\r\nAn excellent description of just how Volta made his electric pile and\r\nwhat he was able to accomplish with it experimentally in the laboratory,\r\nis to be found in the numbers for January and February, 1900, of the\r\nStimmen aus Maria-Laach--a literary and scientific periodical published\r\nby the German Jesuits. This article on Alessandro Volta, by Father\r\nKneller, S. J., was written shortly after the celebration of the\r\nhundredth anniversary of Volta's invention of the electric pile, when\r\nthere had just been a fresh sorting over of Volta's documents, and\r\ncontains a very full set of references to the biographical material for\r\nVolta's life. Father Kneller says:\r\n\r\n\"Before this, no one thought for a moment of any possibility of the\r\npractical application of electricity. But all at once the whole\r\nsituation changed. After eight years of observation and experiment,\r\nVolta accomplished one day, at the beginning of 1800, in his laboratory\r\nat Como, the construction of an instrument which was to revolutionize\r\nthe study and the practical applications of electricity. He made a pile\r\ncomposed of a large number of equal-sized copper and zinc discs. On each\r\ncopper disc he placed one of zinc, and then on this a moistened piece of\r\ncloth, and continued the series of alternate discs and cloths in this\r\norder until he had a rather high column. This was an apparatus as\r\nsimple as possible and from which no one but Volta could possibly have\r\npromised any results. The inventor, however, knew what he was about.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he had connected the upper and lower metal plates by means\r\nof a wire, there began to flow from the zinc to the copper a secret\r\nsomething, which by the application of the ends of the wire to muscles\r\ncaused them to twitch; which appeared before the eye as light; applied\r\nto the tongue, gave a sensation of taste; caused a thin wire to glow and\r\neven to burn between carbon points; produced a blinding light;\r\ndecomposed water into its constituents; dissolved hitherto unknown\r\nmetals out of salts and earth; made iron magnetic; directed the magnetic\r\nneedle out of its path; inclosed wire coils caused new electric currents\r\nto be set up; to say nothing of the awful spectacle which occurred when,\r\nunder the influence of the electric current, the bodies of executed\r\ncriminals again gave movements of the limbs, their thoraxes really\r\nheaved and sank as if they really breathed, and even a dead grasshopper\r\nwas caused to spring and apparently to sing again.\r\n\r\n\"Only now, after the discovery of this new kind of electricity--which\r\ndid not work merely by jerks, but flowed in a constant stream from pole\r\nto pole--only now was this mighty natural agent won to the service of\r\nman. Volta is, therefore, above all others, the one who broke ground not\r\nonly for an immense amount of new knowledge in physics, chemistry and\r\nphysiology, but who also made possible rapid progress in practical\r\nelectricity, in telegraphy, in electric motors and power machines, in\r\nelectroplating and the marvelous results in electro-galvanism which\r\nconstitute our most wonderful mechanical effects at the present time.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after Volta's discovery of the electric pile, or voltaic pile, as\r\nit was called in his honor, his reputation spread throughout Europe. At\r\nthe beginning of 1800, he sent a detailed description of the voltaic\r\npile to the Royal Society of London. During the year 1801 the scientific\r\njournals all over Europe were filled with discussions of his discovery.\r\n\r\nThe French Academy of Sciences invited him to Paris in order to\r\ndemonstrate his discoveries to the members of that body. Volta was now\r\nlooking forward to some peaceful years of study, and, so far as he was\r\npersonally concerned, would surely have refused the invitation.\r\nCircumstances were such, however, that it became a civic duty for him to\r\nproceed to Paris.\r\n\r\nAt this time Napoleon was First Consul, and the Italian cities wished to\r\npropitiate his favor as far as possible. It was considered a wise thing\r\nby the city to send a special delegation to Paris, and, as they knew\r\nNapoleon was deeply interested in scientific discoveries that promised\r\npractical results, the name of Volta was suggested as one of the\r\nofficial delegates. As an associate, Professor Brugnatelli, who had made\r\nsome important investigations in chemistry, and who was later to be an\r\nextender of the practical application of Volta's discoveries by the\r\ninvention of the first method of electroplating, was the other member of\r\nthe delegation. It is a curious reflection on the facilities for travel\r\nat the time, that it took twenty-six days for the delegates to reach\r\nParis from Pavia.\r\n\r\nShortly after their arrival in Paris, the travelers were formally\r\nintroduced to the members of the French Institute, and a number of\r\nsessions of the Academy were held, at which Volta's discoveries were\r\ndiscussed. Volta read a communication on the identity of electricity and\r\ngalvanism. Napoleon, as First Consul, was present at these sessions in\r\nthe robe of an Academician, and was not only an interested listener, but\r\noccasionally, by pertinent questions, drew out significant details of\r\nformer experiments and Volta's own theories with regard to the nature of\r\nthe phenomena observed. At the end of the first meeting, at which Volta\r\ntook a prominent part, Napoleon spent several hours with him talking\r\nabout the prospects of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn his letters to his brothers and to his wife at this time, Volta\r\nexpressed his pleasure at finding how much attention his discoveries\r\nwere attracting all over Europe. As he said himself, Germany, France and\r\nEngland were full of them, and all the distinguished scientists were\r\neager to do him honor. In France, he was chosen one of the eight foreign\r\nmembers of the Institute, and was made Knight Commander of the Legion of\r\nHonor and of the Order of the Iron Crown. Napoleon selected him as one\r\nof the first members of the Italian Academy, which he was then in course\r\nof establishing, and conferred on him the honor of Senator and Count of\r\nthe Kingdom of Italy. The French Academy, after having heard Volta's own\r\ndescription of his experiments and discoveries, contrary to its usual\r\ncustom, voted to him by acclamation its gold medal. More important\r\nstill, Bonaparte made him a present of 6000 lire, and conferred upon him\r\nan annual income of 3000 lire from the public purse. It is an index of\r\nVolta's feeling as a faithful son of the Church, that as this income was\r\nallotted to him from the revenues of the bishopric of Adria, he would\r\nconsent to receive it only after Napoleon's decree had been confirmed\r\nby the Pope.\r\n\r\nVolta had been for nearly twenty years in the University of Pavia before\r\nhe finally found for himself a wife. He was then past forty-nine years\r\nof age. His wife was the youngest daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini.\r\nShe had six sisters, one of whom became a nun, and all the others were\r\nmarried before Volta sought the hand of the youngest. Writing to a\r\nfriend, he says, \"that her sisters had distinguished themselves so much\r\nby piety, prudence, good sense and practical economy in their households\r\nas well as by the most admirable qualities of heart and mind, that he\r\nconsidered himself very fortunate in obtaining a branch from the family\r\ntree; and he took her in preference to others that had been offered to\r\nhim, even though they were possessed of greater physical beauty, more\r\nexalted piety and a larger dowry.\" The marriage seems to have been a\r\nvery happy one, notwithstanding the considerable disparity of ages and\r\nthe very matter-of-fact spirit with which it was entered into by one of\r\nthe parties at least.\r\n\r\nThe charming intimacy of his domestic life may be judged from some of\r\nhis letters to his wife when he was traveling. She was always his\r\nconfidante with regard to new things in science that he saw, and\r\nespecially as regards the kindly reception which he met with from\r\nscientists and the readiness with which they accepted his views. At\r\nfirst, so many of his ideas were new, that it is not surprising that\r\nthey were looked at somewhat askance by contemporary scientists. When,\r\non his journeys through France, he noticed the trend of opinion setting\r\nin favor of his views in electricity, he took pains to tell his wife,\r\nand apparently found his greatest pleasure in having her share the joy\r\nof his triumph.\r\n\r\nOne of the severest blows that he suffered was the untimely death of his\r\neldest son, Flaminio, in 1814. \"This loss,\" he wrote to one of his\r\nnephews not long after, \"strikes me so much to heart that I do not think\r\nI shall ever have another happy day.\" The relations between himself and\r\nhis children were all of the kindliest nature; and the character of the\r\nman comes out perhaps even more clearly in the traditions that are still\r\nextant with regard to the devotion of his servants to him, and\r\nespecially his body-servant, Polonio. Volta was always a simple and\r\nunpretentious person, notwithstanding the fact that scientific and even\r\npolitical honors had been heaped upon him toward the end of his life. It\r\nwas rather difficult, for instance, to get him to change his old clothes\r\nfor new ones. This feat was usually accomplished by Polonio, who, when\r\nhe thought the time had arrived for his master to put on the newer\r\nclothes, would engage him in some scientific explanation of a morning;\r\nthen handing him the new garments, Volta would put them on, and would be\r\nwearing them for some time before he noticed it. The old servant was\r\nthen generally able to persuade him that it was time to make the change.\r\nToward the end of his career, Volta led a retired life in a country\r\nhouse not far from his native city of Como. Foreigners often came to see\r\nor even have the privilege of a few words with the distinguished\r\nscientist who was regarded as the patriarch of electrical science. To\r\nVolta, the being on exhibition was always an unpleasant function. He did\r\nnot care to be lionized, and frequently refused to allow himself even to\r\nbe seen unless his visitors had a scientific motive. On such occasions,\r\nthe only chance of the visitors was to secure the good will of Polonio.\r\nHe would engage his unsuspecting master in a discussion of clouds or\r\nwind, or some appearance in the heavens, or something in the leaves of\r\nthe neighboring trees, and would then bring him to the portico, that he\r\nmight see the supposed phenomenon. This would give occasion for the\r\nvisitors to get at least a glimpse of the scientist, who usually failed\r\nto suspect the real purpose for which he had been tempted out of doors.\r\n\r\nWhile thus living in the country, Volta's piety became a sort of proverb\r\namong the country people. Every morning at an early hour, in company\r\nwith his servant, he could be seen with bowed head making his way to the\r\nchurch. Here he heard mass, and usually the office of the day, in which\r\nall the canons of the cathedral took part. He had a special place on the\r\nepistle side of the altar, not far from the organ. His favorite method\r\nof prayer was the rosary. He was not infrequently held up to the people\r\nby the parish priest as a model of devotion. Whenever he was in the\r\ncountry, every evening saw him taking his walk towards the church. On\r\nthese occasions, he was usually accompanied by members of his family,\r\nand they entered the church for an evening visit to the blessed\r\nsacrament.\r\n\r\nHis behavior toward those who lived in the vicinity of his country place\r\nendeared him to all the peasantry. He was not only liberal in giving\r\nalms, but made it a point to visit frequently the houses of the poor and\r\nhelp them as much as possible by counsel and suggestion. His scientific\r\nknowledge was at command for their benefit, and he was often able to\r\ntell them how to avoid many dangers. He gave them definite ideas with\r\nregard to the importance of cleanliness and the necessity of cooking\r\ntheir food very carefully so as to prevent diseases occasioned by badly\r\ncooked material. He also taught them to distinguish between the\r\nwholesome and the spurred rye, from which their polenta was prepared, in\r\norder to escape the dreaded pellagra, the disease so common in Italy,\r\nwhich comes from the use of diseased grain.\r\n\r\nHe endeared himself so much to the people of the countryside that they\r\ninvented a special name for him, which proclaimed the tenderness of\r\ntheir liking for the man. They knew how much he was honored for his\r\nwonderful discoveries in electricity, and many of them had even seen\r\nsome of the (to them at least) inexplicable phenomena that he could\r\nproduce at will by means of various electrical contrivances. At first\r\nthey called him a \"magician\"; but as this word has, particularly for the\r\nItalian peasantry, a suspicion of evil in it, they added the adjective\r\n\"beneficent,\" and he was generally known as _Il mago benefico_.\r\n\r\nHis interest in these gentle, kindly people may be appreciated from the\r\nfact that he knew practically all of his country neighbors by name, and,\r\nas a rule, he was familiar also with the conditions of their families\r\nand their household affairs. Not infrequently he would stop and talk to\r\nthem about such things, and this favor was always considered as a\r\nprecious mark of his neighborly courtesy by the peasantry.\r\n\r\nSuch was the simplicity of the man whose name is undoubtedly one of the\r\ngreatest in the history of science. The great beginnings of the chapter\r\non applied electricity are all his. There was nothing he touched in his\r\nwork that he did not illuminate. His was typically the mind of the\r\ngenius, ever reaching out beyond the boundaries of the known--an\r\nabundant source of leading and light for others. Far from being a\r\ndoubter in matters religious, his scientific greatness seemed only to\r\nmake him readier to submit to what are sometimes spoken of as the\r\nshackles of faith, though to him belief appealed as a completion of\r\nknowledge of things beyond the domain of sense or the ordinary powers of\r\nintellectual acquisition. Like Pasteur, a century later, the more he\r\nknew, the more ready was he to believe and the more satisfying he found\r\nhis faith. This is a very different picture of the great scientific mind\r\nfrom that ordinarily presented as characteristic of scientific thinkers.\r\nBut Volta is not an exception; rather does he represent the rule, so far\r\nas the very great scientists are concerned; for it is only the\r\nsecond-rate minds, those destined to follow but not to lead, in science,\r\nwho have so constantly proclaimed the opposition of science to faith.\r\n\r\nVolta's well-known confession of faith declares his state of mind with\r\nregard to religion better than any words of a biographer, and it is a\r\nstriking commentary on the impression that has in some inexplicable way\r\ngained wide acceptance, that a man cannot be a great scientist and a\r\nfirm believer in religion. A distinguished professor of psychology at\r\none of the large American universities said not long since, that a\r\nscientist must keep his science and religion apart, or there will be\r\nserious consequences for his religion. Volta's opinion in this matter is\r\nworth remembering. Having heard it said that, though he continued to\r\npractice his religion, this was more because he did not want to offend\r\nfriends, that he did not care to scandalize his neighbors, and did not\r\nwant the poor folk around him to be led by his example into giving up\r\nwhat he knew to be their most fruitful source of consolation in the\r\ntrials of life, while in the full exercise of his intellectual\r\nfaculties, Volta deliberately wrote out his confession of faith so that\r\nall the world of his own and the after time might know it.\r\n\r\n\"If some of my faults and negligences may have by chance given occasion\r\nto some one to suspect me of infidelity, I am ready, as some reparation\r\nfor this and for any other good purpose, to declare to such a one and to\r\nevery other person and on every occasion and under all circumstances\r\nthat I have always held, and hold now, the Holy Catholic Religion as the\r\nonly true and infallible one, thanking without end the good God for\r\nhaving gifted me with such a faith, in which I firmly propose to live\r\nand die, in the lively hope of attaining eternal life. I recognize my\r\nfaith as a gift of God, a supernatural faith. I have not, on this\r\naccount, however, neglected to use all human means that could confirm me\r\nmore and more in it and that might drive away any doubt which could\r\narise to tempt me in matters of faith. I have studied my faith with\r\nattention as to its foundations, reading for this purpose books of\r\napologetics as well as those written with a contrary purpose, and trying\r\nto appreciate the arguments pro and contra. I have tried to realize from\r\nwhat sources spring the strongest arguments which render faith most\r\ncredible to natural reason and such as cannot fail to make every\r\nwell-balanced mind which has not been perverted by vice or passion\r\nembrace it and love it. May this protest of mine, which I have\r\ndeliberately drawn up and which I leave to posterity, subscribed with my\r\nown hand and which shows to all and everyone that I do not blush at the\r\nGospel--may it, as I have said, produce some good fruit.--Signed at\r\nMilan, Jan. 6th, 1815, Alessandro Volta.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Volta wrote this, he was just approaching his sixtieth year and was\r\nin the full maturity of his powers. He lived for twelve years after\r\nthis, looked up to as one of the great thinkers of Europe and as one of\r\nthe most important men of Italy of this time. Far from being in his\r\ndotage, then, he was at the moment surely, if ever, in the best position\r\nto know his own mind with regard to his faith and his relations to the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nThere is a famous picture of Volta, by Magaud, in Marseilles. It\r\nchronicles the fact that Volta had become a Count, a Senator and a\r\nMember of the French Institute, so appointed by Napoleon, and that he is\r\nin some sense therefore a Frenchman. Magaud has painted him standing,\r\nwith his electric apparatus on one side and the Scriptures on the other.\r\nNear him is placed his friend Sylvio Pellico, whose little book, \"My Ten\r\nYears' Imprisonment,\" has endeared him to thousands of readers all over\r\nthe world. Pellico had doubted the presence of Providence in the world\r\nand the existence of a hereafter. In the midst of his doubts, he turned\r\nto Volta. \"In thy old age, O Volta!\" said Pellico, \"the hand of\r\nProvidence placed in thy pathway a young man gone astray. Oh! thou, said\r\nI to the ancient seer, who hast plunged deeper than others into the\r\nsecrets of the Creator, teach me the road that will lead me to the\r\nlight.\" And the old man made answer: \"I too have doubted, but I have\r\nsought. The great scandal of my youth was to behold the teachers of\r\nthose days lay hold of science to combat religion. For me to-day I see\r\nonly God everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Wilcke, a Swedish investigator of electric phenomena,\r\nconstructed in 1762 two machines involving the principle of the\r\nelectrophorus.--(BROTHER POTAMIAN.)\r\n\r\n[20] Brother Potamian has called my attention to the fact that\r\nVolta's work on the origin of electricity from two different metals\r\nwhen, though connected, they were yet separated by some moist medium,\r\nwas curiously anticipated by an observation described by Sulzer, in a\r\nbook called Nouvelle Théorie des Plaisirs, 1767. In this he states that,\r\nif a silver and a lead coin, placed one above and the other under the\r\ntongue, be brought in contact a sour taste develops, which he considers\r\nto be due to vibrations set up by the contact of the two metals. He\r\nseems also to have had a dash of light before the eyes, so that all the\r\nelements necessary for the discovery of the voltaic pile were in his\r\nhands, and indeed he was making what has since become one of the\r\nclassical experiments, by which certain physiological effects of the\r\nelectric current are demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCOULOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat discoverers in science must usually be satisfied with having their\r\nnames attached to some one phase of scientific development, be it an\r\ninstrument, a law, a unit of measurement, a process of investigation or\r\nsome phenomenon which they first observed. The originality of Coulomb's\r\ngenius will be better appreciated, since besides having a unit of\r\nelectricity named after him, there is also a law in electro-magnetics\r\nand a torsion-balance that will always be associated with his name. Few\r\nmen have been more ingenious in their ability to put complex ideas into\r\npractical shape and give them simple mechanical expression by\r\ninstrumental methods. While his name is to be forever associated with\r\nthe science of electrostatics, he was profoundly interested in other\r\ndepartments of physics, and for him to be interested always meant that\r\nhe would illuminate previous knowledge by practical hints and\r\nsuggestions and carry the conclusions of his predecessors a little\r\nfarther into science than they had ever gone before. His was typically\r\nan experimental genius, and he must be considered one of the men of whom\r\nnot more than half a dozen are born in a century, who are, in Kipling's\r\nstrong term, \"masterless\"; who do not need to be taught, but who find\r\nfor themselves a path into the domain of the unknown.\r\n\r\nCoulomb investigated the fundamental law in electricity and magnetism,\r\nthat attractions and repulsions are inversely as the square of the\r\ndistances, and showed that it held accurately for point-charges and\r\npoint-poles. He demonstrated that these interesting phenomena were not\r\nchance manifestations of irregular forces, but that they represented a\r\ndefinite mode of action of force, thus setting this department of\r\nknowledge on a scientific basis. While in practical significance Ohm's\r\nLaw, discovered nearly a half century later, is of much more import,\r\nCoulomb's discoveries are fundamental in character and, coming in the\r\nvery beginnings of modern electrical science, did much to guide the\r\ninfant science in the ways it should follow. The establishing of this\r\nlaw contributed very largely to the rapid development of the twin\r\nsciences of electricity and magnetism. It is experimental observation\r\nthat means most for a rising science; and, in fact, that Coulomb should\r\nhave been the pioneer in it stamps him as possessed not only of great\r\noriginality, but also of the power of independent thinking, which is\r\nperhaps the most precious quality for the man of science.\r\n\r\nThe French investigator succeeded in demonstrating his law by two\r\ndistinct methods which are still used for illustration purposes in our\r\nphysical laboratories. In the first, he employed the torsion-balance\r\ndevised by Michell, and re-invented by himself, an instrument of exact\r\nmeasurement which, in his hands, yielded as invaluable results as it did\r\nin those of Faraday half a century later. The instrument depends on the\r\nprinciple first established by Coulomb himself, that when a wire is\r\ntwisted, the angle of torsion is directly proportional to the force of\r\ntorsion. In the application of this principle, a fine wire is suspended\r\nin a glass case, on the sides of which there is a graduated scale to\r\nmeasure the degree of repulsion between two like poles of a magnet or\r\nbetween similarly electrified bodies.\r\n\r\nIn his second research on the law of the inverse square, Coulomb used\r\nwhat is known as the method of oscillations. A magnetic needle swinging\r\nunder the influence of the earth's magnetism is known to act like a\r\npendulum, and as such obeys the laws of pendular motion. In applying\r\nthis method, Coulomb caused the magnetic needle to oscillate, first,\r\nunder the influence of the earth's magnetism alone and then under the\r\ncombined influence of the earth and the magnet placed at varying\r\ndistances from the needle. The most interesting feature of this work is\r\nthe manner in which Coulomb succeeded in eliminating the important\r\nfactor of the earth's magnetism from the problem. It is so simple and\r\ningenious that it commands the admiration of investigators, who employ\r\nit in their laboratory work even to the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the International Committee which selected the\r\nterm coulomb for the electromagnetic unit of electrical quantity gave\r\nhonor where it was eminently due. Coulomb stands out as a man of\r\nprecision and accuracy, whose methods of exact measurement\r\nrevolutionized the rising science, and whose researches and discoveries\r\nin physics and mechanics furnish ample justification for giving him a\r\nplace among the makers of electricity. He was one of the gifted men\r\nwhose original works ushered in so gloriously the nineteenth century,\r\nand who laid the deep and firm foundations on which the last three\r\ngenerations have built up the magnificent temple of electrical science.\r\n\r\nCharles Augustin de Coulomb was born at Angoulême, June 14th, 1736. His\r\nancestors for several generations had been magistrates, and were looked\r\nupon as representatives of the country nobility. He made his university\r\nstudies in Paris, and while still young, entered the army. From the\r\nvery beginning, however, his genius for mathematics was recognized, and\r\nhe was employed in the capacity of military engineer. To Americans, it\r\nwill be interesting to know that his first engineering project was\r\nundertaken at Martinique, where he constructed Fort Bourbon. His\r\nsterling character and remarkable ability secured him rapid advancement\r\nin the service. In spite of the fact that the climate did not agree with\r\nhim, he remained for three years on the island, because he would not\r\nemploy the political influence that might have secured his recall, since\r\nhe thought it his duty to serve his country in an important colonial\r\npost. Nearly all his comrades perished by fever. It is the irony of fate\r\nthat after his return to France a change in the ministry deprived him of\r\nthe just recompense of his devotion to country, and he did not receive\r\nthe special extraordinary promotion which he had earned in this special\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nDuring a short stay that he made at Paris after his return, he sought\r\nthe society of men of science as far as possible, and succeeded in\r\ngetting in touch with all that was most promising in scientific progress\r\nat the time. He was already known rather favorably by many of the\r\nscientific men of the capital because of the paper on The Statics of\r\nVaults, a monograph on static problems in architecture, which he\r\npresented to the Academy of Sciences in 1779. His next military\r\nassignment was to Rochefort. Here he composed his monograph on \"The\r\nTheory of Simple Machines,\" which carried off the double prize that had\r\nbeen offered by the Academy of Sciences for the solution of problems\r\nconnected with this important question. This attracted the attention not\r\nonly of the scientific world, but also of his military superiors. As a\r\nresult, he was sent successively to Cherburg and to the Isle of Aix, to\r\ndirect engineering works, and accomplished the tasks involved with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, when he was about forty-five years of age, he was\r\nelected member of the Academy of Sciences by a unanimous vote. He was a\r\nman of great personal magnetism, and all those who came in contact with\r\nhim learned to like him for his straightforward character and for the\r\nabsolute righteousness of his life. Few men have made firmer friends\r\nthan Coulomb, as few have ever shown more unselfish devotion to duty and\r\nto conscience than he, though under circumstances that were neither\r\nspectacular nor theatrical. It was harder to face the deadly climate of\r\nMartinique than it would have been to take one's place at the head of a\r\nforlorn hope in an outburst of enthusiastic courage; and Coulomb was to\r\nhave other trials of quite as deterrent a nature, and was to meet them\r\nwith the same imperturbed sense of duty.\r\n\r\nGraft is sometimes supposed to be temptation peculiar only to our own\r\ntimes, but the opportunities for it have always been present in such\r\nwork as Coulomb had to oversee, and the army engineer of all ages has\r\nhad to stand or fall before it. It was proposed, about this time, to\r\nbuild a system of government canals in Brittany. Such a canal-system\r\nwould, as is easy to understand, cost an enormous sum of money and give\r\nmagnificent opportunities for speculation of various kinds. No small\r\nobjection had been made to the project, on the score that it would not\r\nconfer all the benefits on the region that were claimed for it, and\r\nCoulomb was commissioned by the Minister of Marine to determine the\r\nquestion of the advisability of constructing the canals, and of the\r\nprobable effect which they would have on the commerce of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter careful investigation, he came to the conclusion that the\r\nadvantages which were expected to accrue from the project would not\r\ncompensate for the enormous expense that would be entailed. This\r\ndecision aroused the angry protest of a strong political faction, who\r\nexpected to reap wealth and personal advantages of many kinds from the\r\nscheme, and who protested bitterly against Coulomb's report. He was able\r\nto support his conclusions in the matter, however, with such\r\nunanswerable mathematical and engineering arguments, that his opinion\r\nprevailed and the project was given up.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, instead of the opportunity to serve a political party\r\nwith every avenue to preferment and, above all, to wealth open for him,\r\nhe found himself, for the time being, deprived even of the opportunity\r\nto devote himself further to his favorite occupations in military\r\nengineering. The excuse given for this interruption in his career, for\r\nthere has always been an excuse for such action, was that proper\r\nrepresentations for permission to make the report had not been made to\r\nthe Minister of Marine; and instead of commendation, Coulomb received\r\nwhat was practically a reprimand.\r\n\r\nWounded by this injustice, which was manifestly due to the fact that his\r\nhonest report had displeased those who expected to reap personal benefit\r\nfrom the canal project, and disgusted with a service in which such\r\nthings were possible, Coulomb sent in his resignation. The Minister of\r\nMarine realized that the acceptance of the proffered resignation would\r\nsurely expose the ministry at least to suspicion as to the reasons why\r\nCoulomb's report was not accepted with good grace. Permission to retire\r\nfrom the service was refused, as this would insure his silence. He was\r\nordered back to Brittany to continue his work there, possibly with the\r\nidea that this unfavorable experience would be sufficient of itself to\r\nmake him understand what was expected of him and render him a little\r\nmore complacent to the wishes of those in authority. If any such ideas\r\nwere entertained, they were destined to grievous disappointment. Coulomb\r\nwas not of those who, seeing duty plainly, refuse to follow it because\r\nsome personal advantage or disadvantage intervenes. Selfish reasons did\r\nnot appeal to his character nor obscure the issues.\r\n\r\nHe went back to Brittany, ready to express his firm opinion in the\r\nmatter and with integrity of soul untouched. The consequence was that\r\nthe provincial authorities, recognizing their true interests,\r\nacknowledged the error they had come near falling into, and now wished\r\nto reward the engineer handsomely for his unswerving devotion to duty.\r\nCoulomb as promptly refused a reward for doing his duty as he had\r\nignored even the appearance of a bribe to avoid it. Only after\r\nconsiderable pressure was he prevailed upon to accept the best timepiece\r\nthey could procure, on which the arms of the province were engraved. It\r\nhad what was quite rare in those days, a second's hand, and he\r\nconstantly made use of this in all his experimental work thereafter. A\r\nFrench biographer says that, never was a souvenir better chosen nor more\r\nsuitably employed. Coulomb's merits were recognized by the government\r\nauthorities not long after, and he was made superintendent of the\r\nfountains of France. A few years later, he was promoted to the position\r\nof Curator of Plans and Relief Maps of the Military Staff of France,\r\nand was chosen as one of the commission of the French Academy of\r\nSciences who went to England in order to study hospital conditions\r\nthere. At this time, he was at the acme of his career. His grade was\r\nthat of Lieutenant Colonel of Engineers, a position much higher in the\r\nforeign armies at that time than would be the post with the\r\ncorresponding title in our army. He had been made a Chevalier of St.\r\nLouis, and it looked as though a brilliant future were opening out\r\nbefore him. Each year, for a decade, had seen the publication of one or\r\nmore memoirs on important subjects, nearly every one of which contained\r\nsome original material of the highest value, destined not only to add to\r\nCoulomb's reputation, but to furnish basic information for the further\r\ndevelopment of science.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, however, the Revolution broke out, and there was an end to all\r\nCoulomb's opportunities for work. He was utterly out of sympathy with\r\nthe movement, the worst consequences of which he foresaw from the\r\nbeginning, and he at once handed in his resignation of the various\r\npositions that he occupied under the government. He went into almost\r\nabsolute retirement, devoting himself to the education of his children.\r\nDuring this time, however, he did not cease to cultivate science,\r\ninasmuch as he gave the finishing touch to various papers which he had\r\npreviously outlined. Unfortunately, however, his departure from Paris\r\nmade it impossible for him to continue his investigations in electricity\r\nfor want of apparatus, and so there is a ten years' interruption in his\r\nlife of scientific activity and of original work. Besides, it cannot be\r\nsurprising that he should not have had the heart to go on with his work\r\nunder the awful social conditions that prevailed. Many of his friends\r\nlost their lives during the stormy period of the Revolution; most of\r\nthe others were banished or were in hiding. His beloved country had gone\r\ninto an unfortunate eclipse, as he could not help but consider it; most\r\nof the nations of the earth were indeed in league against her, and the\r\nend was not yet in sight. It would be too much to expect of human nature\r\nthat it should devote itself to abstruse problems in science at moments\r\nof such disturbance as this, and so some of the possibilities of\r\nCoulomb's original genius were lost to science during that calamitous\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nLike many of the great discoveries of science, Coulomb's most important\r\nwork was done in the course of other investigations, and came by what\r\nmight be called a happy accident. He had been investigating the\r\nqualities of wire of various kinds, especially with regard to their\r\nelasticity, so as to be able to determine the limits of their use in\r\nvarious engineering projects. When he discovered that the elasticity of\r\ntorsion of a wire was a constant property, he proceeded to utilize it in\r\nthe calculation of such delicate phenomena as those of electric and\r\nmagnetic forces. The first instrument for this purpose that he\r\nconstructed consisted simply of a long magnetized needle suspended\r\nhorizontally by a fine wire. Supposing this needle to be at rest, if one\r\nmoves it away from the magnetic meridian by a certain number of degrees,\r\nthe twisted wire will have a definite tendency to untwist and to bring\r\nback the needle to its original position by a series of oscillations\r\nwhose frequency can be readily observed.\r\n\r\nFor such observations, it is possible to obtain the value of the force\r\nacting on the needle and causing it to move to and fro at a given rate.\r\nThis was the underlying idea which received very simple expression in\r\nthe ingenious instrument which Coulomb devised and called a\r\ntorsion-balance. With it, he set about determining the law which governs\r\nthe mutual action of magnets and of electrified bodies with regard to\r\ndistance, and found it to be the same as that which Newton found to hold\r\nfor bodies distributed throughout the universe, that is, that attraction\r\nand repulsion vary inversely as the square of the distance. He also\r\nproved, with the aid of his torsion-balance, that the forces of\r\nattraction and repulsion vary as the product of the strength of the\r\npoles in one case and as the product of the electric charges in the\r\nother. These were the important discoveries of Coulomb's life; they\r\nserved to earn for him the right to have his name given to the unit of\r\nelectrical quantity, the _coulomb_.\r\n\r\nCoulomb did not stop here, however, but proceeded to apply his laws to\r\nvarious other phenomena. He proved that electricity distributes itself\r\nentirely over the surface of a body without penetrating the mass of the\r\nconductor, and he showed by calculation that this result was a necessary\r\nconsequence of the law of repulsion.\r\n\r\nA list of the papers which he published on electricity and magnetism,\r\nthe titles of which, with French accuracy of expression, furnish an\r\nexcellent idea of their contents, shows the thoroughly progressive and\r\nscientific spirit of the man, and how well he proceeded from the known\r\nto the less known, always widening the bounds of knowledge. Suffice it\r\nto say here that the observations of Coulomb were not only original, but\r\nthat they concerned some of the most difficult questions in\r\nelectricity, and that he was clearing the ground for others in such a\r\nway as to make future work and quantitative measurements in electricity\r\nreliable and comparatively easy. It is because of this pioneer work that\r\nCoulomb deserves so much praise. It was not long before Coulomb's\r\nobservations were confirmed by others, and then the beginnings of the\r\nmodern development of electricity became manifest, owing not a little to\r\nthe researches and inventions, the genius and ingenuity of this French\r\nmilitary engineer.\r\n\r\nSome phases of electrical development attributed to others really belong\r\nto Coulomb. A typical example of this detraction from his merit is the\r\nattribution to Biot of the solution of the problem of the complete\r\ndischarge of an electrified sphere by means of two hollow hemispheres.\r\nThis experiment is fully described by Coulomb, and he even emphasizes\r\nthe fact that the external discharging bodies need not necessarily be of\r\nthe same shape as the charged sphere. Some of what Coulomb accepted as\r\nprinciples in electricity have proved in the course of time, not to be\r\nthe realities that he thought them; but the progress that has led to\r\nsuch contradictions of his opinions has been mainly rendered possible by\r\nhis own discoveries. The fable of the eagle stricken by the arrow\r\ncontaining some of its own feathers, is so old that one might think\r\nthat, when the progress of a science due to a scientist brings men\r\nbeyond the position he occupied, they would not blame him for\r\nbackwardness. This is, however, one of the curious critical methods in\r\nthe history of science that has most frequently to be deprecated by the\r\nhistorian who is tracing origins and developments.\r\n\r\nCoulomb's papers, with the exception of his memoir on \"Problems in\r\nStatics Applied to Architecture,\" his \"Researches on the Methods of\r\nexecuting Works under Water without the Necessity of Pumping,\" his\r\n\"Theory of Simple Machines,\" and his researches \"On Windmills,\" which\r\nform separate monographs, were all published together in a single volume\r\nby the French Physical Society in 1884.[22]\r\n\r\nThis volume contains, besides his investigations on the best way of\r\nmaking magnetic needles, his theoretic and experimental investigations\r\non the force of torsion and on the elasticity of metallic threads, which\r\nwere undertaken in order to enable him to make his electric\r\ntorsion-balance something more than mere guess-work. All the other\r\npapers are concerned directly with electricity or magnetism, and show\r\nhow actively, nearly a hundred and twenty-five years ago, a great mind\r\nwas engaged with problems in electricity which we are apt to consider as\r\nbelonging more properly to our own time. The list of papers published in\r\nthese memoirs, arranged in chronological order, gives a good idea of the\r\ndevelopment of electrical science in Coulomb's own mind. There is a\r\nlogical as well as a chronological order to be observed in them.\r\n\r\nIn 1785, when he was just approaching his fiftieth year, there were\r\nthree subjects with regard to which Coulomb's experimental observations\r\nenabled him to set down some definite principles. The first of these was\r\nthe construction and use of an electric balance, founded on the\r\nproperty which wires have of exhibiting a torque proportional to the\r\nangle of torsion. The second was the determination of the laws,\r\naccording to which the magnetic and electric \"fluids,\" as Coulomb and\r\ninvestigators in electricity called them at that time, act both as\r\nregards repulsion and attraction. The third was the determination of the\r\nquantity of electricity which an insulated body loses in a given time\r\nfrom contact with air more or less moist.\r\n\r\nIn 1786, he published a paper in which he demonstrated what he\r\nconsidered the principal properties of the electric fluid. These are,\r\nthat this fluid does not spread itself on a substance by any chemical\r\naffinity or any elective attraction, but that it distributes itself over\r\nvarious bodies that are placed in contact, entirely in accordance with\r\ntheir shape; and also that in electrical conductors, the charge is\r\nlimited to the surface of the conductor and does not penetrate to any\r\nappreciable depth.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, his only paper was on the manner in which the electrical fluid\r\ndivides itself between two conducting bodies placed in contact, and on\r\nthe distribution of this fluid over the different parts of the surface\r\nof these bodies. He continued his investigations into this subject in\r\n1788, and also succeeded in determining the density of the electricity\r\nat different points on the surface of conducting bodies.\r\n\r\nIn 1789, he began to work more particularly on magnetism. His first\r\npaper on the subject was published that year. Unfortunately, as we have\r\nsaid, the Revolution interrupted his scientific investigations at this\r\npoint, and for the next eleven years we have nothing from his pen. As a\r\nnobleman, he was compelled to leave Paris, and this not only put him out\r\nof touch with scientific work generally, but deprived him of the\r\nopportunities of using such apparatus as was necessary to carry on his\r\nexperiments. That he acted prudently in leaving Paris, the careers of\r\nother scientists amply prove. Lavoisier continued to carry on his\r\nchemical investigations during the stormy times of the Revolution, but\r\nhis stay in the capital eventually cost him his life. Abbé Haüy, the\r\nfather of crystallography,[21] who, because of his contributions to the\r\nscience of pyro-electricity, is of special interest to us, continued to\r\nwork at his crystals throughout even the Reign of Terror. When thrown\r\ninto prison, he asked and obtained permission to have his crystals with\r\nhim. His friends saved him from Lavoisier's fate, but not without an\r\neffort, as his life was seriously endangered.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, however, that a member of the nobility like\r\nCoulomb, whose life had been spent in military affairs, should not be\r\nable to devote himself seriously to scientific matters while his country\r\nwas in such a turmoil.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, he resumed his investigations once more, but now they are\r\nconcerned more particularly with magnetism. The first was a theoretical\r\nand practical determination of the forces which hold different magnetic\r\nneedles, magnetized to saturation, in the magnetic meridian. This was\r\nfollowed, in the same year, by a paper which, like its predecessor, was\r\npublished among the memoirs of the Institute of France, which had\r\nreplaced the Royal Academy of Sciences, to which body many of Coulomb's\r\npapers of the former time had been presented, and in whose publications\r\nthey originally appeared. This second paper detailed his experiments on\r\nthe determination of the force of cohesion of fluids and the law of\r\nresistance in them, when the movements were very slow.\r\n\r\nWhen the French Institute was organized under Napoleon in 1801, Coulomb\r\nwas named among its first members. It is believed that he was even\r\nchosen to occupy a place in the first government of the state, but a man\r\nmore interested in politics obtained the place, a fortunate circumstance\r\nfor science. Coulomb was named, however, one of the inspectors of public\r\ninstruction, then the highest place in the education department, and he\r\ndid much to restore to France the educational system that had been\r\ndestroyed during the Revolution. In this rather trying work he was noted\r\nfor the kindliness yet firmness of his character, while his absolute\r\nfairness and sense of justice were recognized on all sides.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Coulomb was not long spared to continue his work. He took\r\nup his experimental and mathematical investigations, on his return to\r\nthe capital, with great enthusiasm, but his health had been undermined\r\nand his work had been rudely interrupted. After 1801, no further paper\r\nby him appears to have been published until 1806. This gave the result\r\nof different methods employed in order to produce in blades and bars of\r\nsteel the greatest degree of magnetism. For some time preceding this, in\r\nspite of increasing ill-health, he had continued his experiments on the\r\ninfluence of temperature on the magnetism of steel. His work on this\r\nsubject was not destined to be completed, for not long after passing his\r\nseventieth year, in June of this year, his health gave way completely,\r\nand he died August 23d, 1806. His final observations were gathered by\r\nBiot, carefully preserved, and assigned a place in the volume of\r\nCoulomb's Memoirs, issued by the French Physical Society.\r\n\r\nPersonally, Coulomb was noted for great seriousness of character, though\r\nwith this was mingled a gentleness of disposition that made for him some\r\ncordial friendships among his scientific contemporaries. He had but few\r\nfriends, but those who were admitted to his intimacy made up by the\r\ndepth of their affection for the smallness of their number. Even those\r\nwho had occasion to meet him but once or twice, carried away from their\r\nmeeting an affectionate remembrance of his kindliness and courtesy and\r\nreadiness to help wherever he could be of service. He was extremely\r\nhappy in his family relations, and this proved to be a great source of\r\nconsolation to him during the years when the progress of the French\r\nRevolution took him away from science and made him almost despair of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Biot, the great French physicist, in writing\r\nof Coulomb in his Mélanges Scientifiques et Littéraires, Vol. III.\r\n(Paris, 1858), should have held Coulomb up as a model of the simple,\r\nearnest, helpful life and as a man of the most exemplary character. He\r\nsays: \"Coulomb lived among the men of his time in patience and charity.\r\nHe was distinguished among them mainly by his separation from their\r\npassions and their errors, and he always maintained himself calm, firm\r\nand dignified _in se totus teres atque rotundus_, as Horace says, a\r\ncomplete, perfect and well-rounded character.\" Few men have deserved so\r\nnoble a eulogy as this, written nearly fifty years after his death, by\r\none who had known Coulomb himself and his contemporaries well; it has\r\nnone of the exaggeration of a funeral panegyric, and is evidently\r\nfounded on details of knowledge with regard to the great electrician\r\nwhich had become a tradition among French scientists, and which Biot\r\nhas forever crystallized into the history of science by his emphatic\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nOne could scarcely wish for a better epitaph than Biot's summing up of\r\nCoulomb's personal character: \"All those who knew Coulomb know how the\r\ngravity of his character was tempered by the sweetness of his\r\ndisposition, and those who had the happiness to meet him at their\r\nentrance into a scientific career have kept the most tender remembrance\r\nof his gentle good-heartedness.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HANS CHRISTIAN OERSTED]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Collection de Memoires relatifs à La Physique Publiés Par\r\nla Société Française de Physique.

Witness the animated and prolonged discussion\r\nwhich took place between Volta and Galvani, and which led to enduring\r\nresults for the welfare of mankind. Wishing to prove the correctness of\r\nhis theory of electrification by contact against Galvani's animal\r\nelectricity, Volta devoted himself unremittingly to experimentation\r\nuntil, in the century year 1800, his brilliant work culminated in the\r\ninvention of the \"pile\" or electric battery which bears his name.\r\n\r\nA suspicion had been growing for many years in the minds of physicists,\r\nthat there must be some degree of relationship, probably an intimate\r\none, between magnetism and electricity, between magnetic and electric\r\nforces. In the year 1785, van Swinden, a celebrated Dutch physicist,\r\npublished a work on electricity in which he described and commented upon\r\na number of analogies which he had observed between the two orders of\r\nphenomena; but, voluminous as was the work, it threw no light on the\r\nnature of the suspected relationship.\r\n\r\nIt was well known, in the case of houses and ships struck by lightning,\r\nthat knives, forks and other articles made of steel were often found to\r\nbe permanently magnetized. Following up this pregnant observation,\r\nexperimenters often sought to impart magnetic properties to steel\r\nneedles by Leyden-jar discharges, but with indifferent success.\r\nSometimes there would be a trace of magnetism left and sometimes none.\r\nIn no case was it possible to say beforehand which end of the\r\nknitting-needle would have north polarity and which south.\r\n\r\nThough we are better equipped to-day for research work than were our\r\npredecessors in the electrical field fifty years ago, we are still\r\nunable to predict the polarity that will result in a bar of iron from a\r\ngiven condenser discharge. The uncertainty arises from the fact\r\ndisclosed by Joseph Henry in 1842 and well known to-day that, under\r\nordinary circumstances, all such discharges consist of a rush of\r\nelectricity to and fro, that is, they give rise to an oscillatory\r\ncurrent of exceedingly short duration. Were it otherwise, that is, were\r\nthe discharge unidirectional, the needle would always be magnetized to a\r\ndegree of intensity proportional to the energy released; and it would be\r\npossible in every case to foretell with certainty the resulting polarity\r\nwhich the needle would acquire.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the voltaic battery, a generator which supplies a\r\nsteady flow of current in one direction, the interesting problem of\r\nrelationship between electric and magnetic forces was again attacked;\r\nand this time with considerable success.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest investigator afield was Romagnosi, an Italian\r\nphysician residing in Trent (Tyrol), who, in the year 1802, published in\r\nthe \"Gazetta\" of his town an account of an experiment which he had made,\r\nand which showed that he was working on promising lines. What he did was\r\nthis: having connected one end of a silver chain to a voltaic pile, and\r\nhaving carried the chain through a glass tube for the purpose of\r\ninsulation, he presented the free end, terminating in a knob, to a\r\ncompass-needle, also insulated. At first, the needle was attracted; and,\r\nafter contact, repelled. Whatever Romagnosi thought of his experiment\r\nand its theoretical bearing, the attraction and subsequent repulsion of\r\nthe compass-needle which he said he observed were electrostatic and not\r\nelectromagnetic effects. The Italian physician was indeed on the verge\r\nof a great discovery; but he halted in his course and lost his\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\nMojon, Professor of chemistry in Genoa, was a little more fortunate,\r\nthough he, too, failed to improve his opportunities. In 1804, he sought\r\nto magnetize steel needles by placing them for a period of twenty days\r\nin circuit with a battery of one hundred elements of the crown-of-cups\r\ntype, and had the satisfaction of finding them permanently magnetized\r\nwhen withdrawn from the circuit. Unlike the electrostatic effect of his\r\nfellow-countryman Romagnosi, this was unquestionably an electromagnetic\r\neffect, the first link in the long chain connecting electricity with\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\nThat this result attracted wide attention at the time, as it well\r\ndeserved, is evident from the notice given by Izarn in his \"Manuel du\r\nGalvanisme,\" and by Aldini in his \"Essai Théorique et expérimental sur\r\nle Galvanisme,\" both of which were published in Paris in the same year,\r\n1804.\r\n\r\nThough the manuals of Izarn and Aldini served to give a fresh impetus to\r\nthe quest of the relationship between electricity and magnetism, it was\r\nnot, however, until the year 1820 that the cardinal discovery was made\r\nby one philosopher and the intimate relationship revealed by another.\r\nThen all Europe rang with the names of Oersted, the fortunate discoverer\r\nof the \"magnetic effect\" of the electric current, and Ampère, whose\r\nmasterly analysis disclosed the nature of the long-sought-for\r\nconnection. In the delight of the hour, men called Oersted the Columbus,\r\nand Ampère the Newton, of electricity.\r\n\r\nThough a philosopher of a high order and lecturer of interest and\r\nbrilliancy, Oersted was, nevertheless, a poor experimentalist. He was\r\nfine in the abstract, awkward in the concrete. Often did he call for the\r\nassistance of a student to perform an experiment for the class under his\r\ndirection. Hansteen, who is celebrated for his very fine work in\r\nterrestrial magnetism, often had this privilege, for he was clear of\r\nmind and deft of hand. Writing to Faraday, he said: \"Oersted was a man\r\nof genious, but very unsuccessful as a demonstrator, for he could not\r\nmanipulate instruments.\"\r\n\r\nIn seeking for some evidence of a physical interaction between\r\nelectricity and magnetism, Oersted on one occasion, placed a wire\r\nconveying a current vertically across a compass-needle; and, on\r\nobtaining no result, seemed greatly disappointed. He evidently expected\r\nthe needle to respond in some way to the energy of the current; and so\r\nit would have responded had he placed the wire in any other position\r\nthan the particular one which he selected. The Danish philosopher now\r\nhesitates; and for lack of coolness, patience and resourcefulness, runs\r\nthe risk of losing the crowning glory of his life. He is disappointed at\r\nhis failure; and for the nonce, contents himself with brooding over it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22 The magnetic effect of an electric current.\r\n  Oersted, 1820]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, having a stronger battery at his disposal, he\r\ndetermined to try the experiment again, in the hope that the greater\r\nenergy at his command would provoke the magnet to respond. This time, he\r\nstretched the wire over and parallel to the compass needle, when, to\r\nhis intense delight, the magnet turned aside as soon as the circuit was\r\nclosed. The result was pronounced and instantaneous. The Professor, an\r\nenthusiast by nature, waxed warm over his good fortune, and well might\r\nhe do so, as the discovery which he had just made was destined to\r\nrevolutionize existing modes of transmitting intelligence to distant\r\nparts and bring remotest countries into direct, and immediate relation\r\nwith one another.\r\n\r\nThat Oersted fell into ecstasy over his success was but natural, though\r\nit is not stated that he exhibited his enthusiasm by the performance of\r\nany unusual feat. When Lavoisier made a discovery, he was wont to take\r\nhold of his assistant and go dancing around with him for sheer joy.\r\nAfter making a certain successful experiment in his laboratory,\r\nGay-Lussac gave vent to his feelings by dancing round the room, and\r\nclapping his hands the while. It is related that, when Davy saw the\r\nfirst globules of potassium burst through the crust of potash and take\r\nfire, his delight knew no bounds. He also took to dancing, and some time\r\nhad to elapse before he was sufficiently composed to continue his work.\r\nEven the cool and self-possessed Faraday occasionally waxed warm on\r\nseeing his efforts crowned with success. It is said that, when he got a\r\nwire conveying a current to revolve round the pole of a magnet, he\r\nrubbed his hands vigorously and danced around the table, his face\r\nbeaming with delight: \"There they go, there they go; we have succeeded\r\nat last,\" he said. He then gleefully proposed to cease work for the day\r\nand spend the evening at Astley's seeing the feats of well-trained\r\nhorses!\r\n\r\nHaving realized that his experiment was one of fundamental importance in\r\nphysical theory, our philosopher proceeds to repeat it under varying\r\nconditions. He places the wire conveying the current in front of the\r\nneedle, behind it, under it, across it; he reverses the current in each\r\ncase, and notices the direction in which the needle turns. Though he\r\nstates results very clearly, he gives no general rule whereby the\r\ndirection of the deflection may be foretold from that of the current. A\r\n_memoria technica_ to meet all cases that may occur was needed, and was\r\npromptly supplied by Ampère, who, with a flash of genius, devised the\r\nrule of the little swimmer. Others have been added since, such as the\r\ncork-screw rule and the rule involving the outspread right hand; but the\r\nswimmer appeals in a manner quite its own to the fancy of the youthful\r\nstudent. It pleases while it instructs; it is ingenious while yet\r\nremarkably simple.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Philosopher of Copenhagen was led by mere\r\naccident to the experiment which will hand his name down the ages; but\r\ninasmuch as he was looking, during thirteen years, for a result\r\nanalogous to the one which he obtained, it is only right to give him\r\nfull credit for the success which he achieved. It has been well\r\nremarked, that the seeds of great discoveries are constantly floating\r\naround us, but take root only in minds well prepared to receive them.\r\nAccidents of the Oersted type happen only to men who deserve them, as\r\nwas the case with Musschenbroek and Galvani in the eighteenth century,\r\nand with Roentgen in the nineteenth. The electrification of a flask of\r\nwater, the twitching of frogs' legs in response to electric sparks, and\r\nthe blackening of a sensitive screen by a distant, shielded Crookes's\r\ntube, led to the electrostatic condenser in the first case, to\r\n\"galvanism\" in the second, and to the photography of the invisible in\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\nWriting of Oersted's discovery, Faraday said that \"It burst open the\r\ngates of a domain in science, dark till then, and filled it with a flood\r\nof light.\"\r\n\r\nThe discovery of 1820 was hailed throughout Europe by an extraordinary\r\noutburst of enthusiasm. Oersted was complimented and congratulated on\r\nall sides. Honors were showered upon him: the Royal Society of London\r\nawarded him the Copley medal; the French Academy of Sciences gave him\r\nits gold medal for the physico-mathematical sciences; Prussia conferred\r\nupon him the Ordre pour le Mérite, and his own country made him a Knight\r\nof the Daneborg.\r\n\r\nOersted lost no time in preparing a memoir on the subject of his work, a\r\ncopy of which was sent to the learned societies and most renowned\r\nphilosophers of Europe. The memoir, which was written in Latin and dated\r\nJuly 21st, 1820, consisted of four quarto pages with the title\r\n\"Experiments on the effect of the electric conflict on the magnetic\r\nneedle.\"\r\n\r\nA perusal of this paper brings home the conviction that Oersted realized\r\nfairly well the forces which came into play in his experiment; for in\r\none place, he speaks of the effect as due to a transverse force\r\nemanating from the conductor conveying the current, and again as a\r\nconflict acting in a revolving manner around the wire. A complete\r\nstatement of the nature of the mechanical force exerted by a conductor\r\nconveying a current on a magnetic needle was given almost immediately by\r\nAmpère, a master analyst and accomplished experimentalist.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23 Magnetic field surrounding a conductor carrying a\r\n  current]\r\n\r\nIt will stand for all time in the history of science, that in less than\r\ntwo months after the publication of Oersted's memoir, Ampère succeeded\r\nin showing the mechanical effect in magnitude and direction of an\r\nelement of current not only on the magnetic needle itself, but also on a\r\nsimilar element of an adjacent conductor conveying a current, thereby\r\nfounding a new science in the department of physics, the science of\r\nelectro-dynamics.\r\n\r\nOersted does not appear to have given thought to the practical\r\npossibilities of his discovery. While appreciating the utilitarian in\r\nscience, he evidently preferred the pursuit of knowledge for its own\r\nsake. In a discourse which he delivered in 1814 before the University of\r\nCopenhagen, he put himself on record when he said that \"The real laborer\r\nin the scientific field chooses knowledge as his highest aim.\"\r\n\r\nSo said Plato ages before, and so said Archimedes, who held that it was\r\nundesirable for a philosopher to seek to apply the discoveries of\r\nscience to any practical end. The screw which he invented, his catapults\r\nand burning mirrors, show, however, that when necessary the Syracusan\r\nmathematician could come down from the serene heights of investigation\r\nto the prosaic arena of application.\r\n\r\nBefore Oersted spoke of \"the real laborer,\" Thomas Young had affirmed\r\nthat \"Those who possess the genuine spirit of scientific investigation\r\nare content to proceed in their researches without inquiring at every\r\nstep what they gain by their newly discovered lights, and to what\r\npractical purposes they are applicable.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24 Magnetic whirl surrounding a wire through which a\r\n  current is passing]\r\n\r\nYoung's most illustrious successor in the Royal Institution, Michael\r\nFaraday, devoted himself calmly but unflinchingly to research work, in\r\nthe conviction that no discovery, however remote in its nature, from the\r\nsubject of daily observation, could with reason be declared wholly\r\ninapplicable to the benefit of mankind. After discovering in 1831 that\r\nelectric currents could be produced by the relative motion of magnets\r\nand coils of wire, a discovery which is the basis of all the electric\r\nengineering of our day, Faraday constructed several experimental\r\nmachines embodying this principle, and then turned away abruptly from\r\nthe work, saying, \"I had rather been desirous of discovering new facts\r\nand new relations dependent on magneto-electric induction than of\r\nexalting the force of those already obtained, being assured that the\r\nlatter would find their full development hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nOur own Joseph Henry, whose sterling merit is universally recognized,\r\nbeautifully said in this connection: \"He who loves truth for its own\r\nsake feels that its highest claims are lowered by being continually\r\nsummoned to the bar of immediate and palpable utility.\"\r\n\r\nOersted seems to have shared the opinion largely held by the scientific\r\nmen of his day, that electricity is mainly a magnetic phenomenon.\r\nAmpère, for one, did not think so, as is evident from the beautiful\r\ntheory which he devised to explain the magnetism of a bar by minute\r\nelectric currents flowing round each individual molecule of the iron. To\r\nthe French physicist, magnetism was purely an electrical phenomenon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 25 Ampère's molecular currents]\r\n\r\nThough propounded more than eighty years ago, this theory is still in\r\nharmony with all facts and phenomena in the domain of magnetism known\r\nto-day. It is important to remember, when thinking of this physical\r\ntheory, that the Amperian currents in question are confined to the\r\nmolecule, and that they do not flow from one molecule to another.\r\nCritics have urged against the theory that the molecules must be heated\r\nby the circulation of these elementary currents, to which objection it\r\nhas been replied that, as we know nothing of the nature of the molecule,\r\nwe cannot say that it offers any resistance to the current; and,\r\ntherefore, we cannot affirm that there is any development of heat due to\r\nthe circulation of these elementary currents.\r\n\r\nIt is to Ampère's credit that he was also the first to propose a\r\npractical application of Oersted's discovery, an application that was\r\nnothing less than the electric telegraph itself. He suggested that the\r\ndeflection of the magnetic needle could be used for the transmission of\r\nsignals from one place to another by means of as many needles and\r\ncircuits as there are letters in the alphabet. If Ampère had only\r\nrecalled the optical and mechanical telegraphs in use in his day, such\r\nas the swinging of lanterns by night and wigwagging of flags and the\r\nmovements of semaphores by day, he might have reduced his twenty-four\r\ncircuits to one, using the two elements, viz., motion of the needle to\r\nthe right and motion to the left, to make up the entire alphabet. Morse\r\nsubstituted the dot and the dash for these deflections, and thus\r\nrendered the reception of messages automatic and permanent.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this proposal to use a magnetic needle for the\r\ntransmission of intelligence, the reader will no doubt recall the\r\nlover's telegraph, so beautifully described by Addison in the\r\n\"Spectator\" for December 6th, 1711; but ingeniously conceived as it was,\r\nthis magnetic telegraph was purely and simply a creation of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThis canny conceit has been attributed to Cardinal Bembo, the elegant\r\nscholar and private secretary to Pope Leo X.; but it was his friend\r\nPorta, the versatile philosopher, who made it widely known by the vivid\r\ndescription which he gave of it in his celebrated work on \"Natural\r\nMagic,\" published at Naples in 1558.\r\n\r\nThis sympathetic telegraph consisted, we are told, of a magnetic needle\r\npoised in the center of a dial-plate, with the letters of the alphabet\r\nwritten around it. The two fortunate individuals privileged to hold\r\n_wireless_ correspondence with each other having agreed as to the day\r\nand the hour, proceed to the room in which the wonderful instrument is\r\nkept, where, as soon as one of them turns the needle of his transmitter\r\nto a letter, the distant needle turns at once in sympathy to the same\r\nletter on its dial!\r\n\r\nSuch is the power of magnetic sympathy, that the instruments will work\r\nsuccessfully though hills, forests, lakes or mountains intervene! Porta\r\nhas it: \"To a friend at a distance shut up in prison, we may relate our\r\nminds; which, I do not doubt, may be done by means of compasses having\r\nthe alphabet written around them.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26 The \"sympathetic telegraph\" from Cabeo's\r\n  _Philosophia Magnetica_, 1629]\r\n\r\nThis sympathetic magnetic telegraph figures extensively in the\r\nscientific literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: some\r\nbelieved in the figment, others condemned it. Addison described it in\r\nelegant prose, and Akenside in beautiful verse. Perhaps the most famous\r\ncomposition on the subject is a short Latin poem, written, after the\r\nstyle and vein of Lucretius, in 1617 by Famianus Strada, an Italian\r\nJesuit. A few years after its publication in the author's \"Prolusiones,\"\r\na metrical translation was made by Hakewill and inserted on page 285 of\r\nhis \"Apologie, or Declaration of the Power and Providence of God,\" 1630.\r\n\r\nOwing to the interest that attaches to this celebrated composition and\r\nthe difficulty of getting Hakewill's \"Apologie,\" we append his version\r\nof the poem.\r\n\r\n    The Loade above all other stones hath this strange property\r\n    If sundry steels thereto or needles you apply,\r\n    Such force and motion thence they draw that they\r\n         incline\r\n    To turn them to the Bear, which near the Pole doth shine.\r\n    Nay, more, as many steels as touch that virtuous stone\r\n    In strange and wondrous sort conspiring all in one\r\n    Together move themselves and situate together:\r\n    As if one of those steels at Rome be stirred, the other\r\n    The self-same way will stir though they far distant be,\r\n    And all through Nature's force and secret sympathy;\r\n    Well then if you of aught would fain advise your friend\r\n    That dwells far off, to whom no letter you can send;\r\n    A large smooth round table make, write down the\r\n         crisscross row\r\n    In order on the verge thereof, and then bestow\r\n    The needle in the midst which touch'd the Loade that so\r\n    What note soe'er you list, it straight may turn unto.\r\n    Then frame another orb in all respects like this\r\n    Describe the edge and lay the steel thereon likewise,\r\n    The steel which from the self-same Magnes motion drew;\r\n    This orb send with thy friend what time he bids adieu.\r\n    But on the days agree at first, when you do mean to\r\n         prove\r\n    If the steel stir, and to what letter it doth move.\r\n    This done, if with thy friend thou closely wouldst\r\n         advise,\r\n    Who in a country off far distant from thee lies,\r\n    Take thou the orb and steel which on the orb was set\r\n    The crisscross on the edge thou seest in order writ.\r\n    What notes will frame thy words, to them direct thy\r\n         steel\r\n    And it sometimes to this, sometimes to that note wheel\r\n    Turning it round about so often till you find\r\n    You have compounded all the meaning of your mind.\r\n    Thy friend that dwells far off, O strange! doth plainly\r\n         see\r\n    The steel so stir though it by no man stirréd be,\r\n    Running now here, now there: he conscious of the plot\r\n    As the steel-guide pursues, and reads from note to note.\r\n    Then gathering into words those notes, he clearly sees\r\n    What's needful to be done, the needle truchman is.\r\n    Now, when the steel doth cease its motion; if thy friend\r\n    Think it convenient answer back to send,\r\n    The same course he may take; and, with his needle\r\n         write\r\n    Touching the several notes which so he list indite.\r\n    Would God, men would be pleased to put this course in\r\n         use,\r\n    Their letters would arrive more speedy and more sure,\r\n    No rivers would them stop nor thieves them intercept;\r\n    Princes with their own hands, their business might effect.\r\n    We scribes, from black sea 'scaped, at length with hearty\r\n         wills\r\n    At th' altar of the Loade would consecrate our quills.\r\n\r\nAnother translation of the poem was made by Dr. Samuel Ward and\r\npublished at the end of his \"Wonders of the Loadstone,\" 1640.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27 The \"sympathetic telegraph\" from Turner's _Ars\r\n  Notoria_, 1657]\r\n\r\nAmpère's suggestion, made, as we have seen, in the year 1820, was not\r\nthe first proposal to use electricity for telegraphic purposes. Already,\r\nin 1753, a writer in _The Scots Magazine_, signing himself C. M.\r\n(Charles Morrison, of Greenock, according to Sir David Brewster, and\r\nCharles Marshall, of Paisley, according to Latimer Clark), outlined a\r\nmethod involving the use of frictional electricity; and Lesage, of\r\nGeneva, constructed a short experimental line, in 1774, consisting of\r\ntwenty-four wires and a pith-ball electroscope. But the man who attained\r\nthe greatest success in the employment of static electricity for this\r\npurpose was Ronalds, of London, who, in 1816, erected a single-wire line\r\neight miles long in his gardens at Hammersmith, with a pair of\r\npith-balls and a rotating disc for receiving instrument.\r\n\r\nWhen well satisfied that his system was practicable and reliable,\r\nRonalds wrote to the head of the intelligence department in London\r\nurging the adoption of his invention for the public service; but he was\r\npromptly brought to realize the scant encouragement so often extended to\r\ninventors by persons in high places, that responsible official politely\r\ninforming him \"that telegraphs of all kinds are wholly unnecessary,\" and\r\nthat no other than the mechanical one in daily use would be adopted.\r\n\r\nWhen penning these words, the representative of the British government\r\nmust have forgotten the experience of 1812, when the result of the\r\nbattle of Salamanca was semaphored from Plymouth to London, on which\r\noccasion a fog cut off the message after the transmission of the first\r\ntwo words, \"Wellington defeated,\" the remainder of the despatch, \"the\r\nFrench at Salamanca,\" reaching the capital only on the following\r\nmorning!\r\n\r\nA rapid sketch of the life of our philosopher, whose discovery of the\r\nmagnetic effect of the voltaic current in 1820 led to the invention of\r\nthe electric telegraph, cannot be without interest.\r\n\r\nHans Christian Oersted was born on August 14th, 1777, in the little town\r\nof Rudkjöbing, in the island of Langeland, Denmark. Being the son of\r\npoor parents, his early years were spent in very narrow circumstances.\r\nHe and his younger brother were mainly indebted to their own efforts for\r\nwhatever instruction they received in the rudiments of learning. The\r\ntown in which they lived being small, offered few opportunities for\r\neducation, even if the family exchequer had been such as to permit the\r\nboys to take advantage of them. There was a German wigmaker in the\r\nplace, however, who was a little more advanced in knowledge than the\r\ngenerality of the townspeople. He and his wife liked the Oersted boys,\r\nwho were very frequently to be found in the wigmaker's shop. The good\r\nhousewife taught them to read, while the artist himself taught them a\r\nlittle German. Hans Christian advanced so rapidly in his studies that he\r\nacquired a reputation for precociousness, which, with the usual\r\nprejudice against bright children, made the neighbors shake their heads\r\nprophetically and say: \"The child will not live; he is too bright to\r\nlast long.\"\r\n\r\nHans Christian learned the elements of arithmetic from an old\r\nschool-book which he picked up by chance; and no sooner had he advanced\r\na little, than he set about instructing his brother. Very probably, the\r\nteacher benefited quite as much by this process of instruction as the\r\npupil. Adversity is a good school for the formation of character as well\r\nas for the acquisition of knowledge. It is evident, from the lives of\r\nsuch men as Oersted, Faraday, Kepler, Ohm, and others who were brought\r\nup in the lap of poverty, that it is not so much educational opportunity\r\nthat is needed for the development of mind which we call education, as\r\nthe earnest determination and the abiding desire to have it. Even\r\nboyhood creates its own opportunities for education despite intervening\r\nobstacles, if it has only a decided eagerness, a pronounced thirst for\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that the young Oersteds entered their teens, their father\r\nsecured the services of a private teacher to give them some instruction\r\nin the rudiments of Latin and Greek. This accidental preceptor was only\r\na wandering student who happened to be in the place at the time; but the\r\nboys, in their eagerness to learn, derived more benefit from his lessons\r\nthan many boys of their age often do nowadays from the help and\r\nencouragement of a carefully selected and academically equipped tutor.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twelve, Oersted senior was taken into his father's\r\napothecary-shop in quality of assistant, a position which seemed\r\ndestined to put an end to all opportunities for further advancement in\r\nthe path of learning. When a boy goes into a drug-store in an official\r\ncapacity, his future career is usually settled; he is a druggist to the\r\nend. His new avocation, however, proved to be the beginning of new\r\nintellectual activities for Oersted. The chemical side of his work\r\nbecame a source of new information to him, and also a stimulus to learn\r\nall that he could of chemistry and kindred subjects. Science became a\r\nhobby with the young apothecary, and everything relating to it appealed\r\nto him. What Hans learned, he as usual imparted to his brother, who was\r\nalready becoming interested in other departments of learning, especially\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nThe desire of the boys to advance grew with their stock of knowledge.\r\nAccordingly, when, in 1794, Hans was only seventeen years of age and his\r\nbrother sixteen, they both matriculated at the University of Copenhagen.\r\nTheir father was able to help them but little, so that they were obliged\r\nto live quietly and sparingly, a condition distinctly favorable to\r\nconsecutive and efficient study. They became so successful in their\r\npursuits that they soon began to attract attention. Having passed\r\ncreditable examinations, they were recommended for pecuniary assistance\r\nfrom an educational fund established by the government for the purpose.\r\nEven then, as receipts were hardly equal to expenses, they sought to\r\nincrease their little revenue by giving private lessons in their leisure\r\nhours. Here we have a striking example of what may be accomplished by\r\nmen who work their way through College in the teeth of adverse\r\ncircumstances; in these two brothers, we have proof of the truth that it\r\nis the student's mind, his willingness and determination to work, that\r\ncount in education more than the golden opportunities that may fall to\r\nhis lot.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1799, Oersted prepared a thesis on \"The Architectonics of\r\nNatural Metaphysics,\" which won for him his Doctorate in Philosophy.\r\nThough the young Doctor did not hesitate to discuss metaphysical\r\nproblems and even to disagree with Kant at a time when most Teutonic\r\nminds were deeply under the influence of the philosopher of Königsberg,\r\nhis chief interests, however, centered in the experimental sciences, in\r\nphysics and chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his devotedness to science, Oersted allowed himself, by way\r\nof distraction, an occasional excursion into the field of literature. A\r\ngreat literary and artistic movement was making itself felt in the\r\nnorthern part of Europe at the time. The æsthetic awakening of the\r\nTeutonic nations had come after three centuries of religious and\r\npolitical unrest, ill adapted to intellectual development. Lessing and\r\nWinkelmann, Goethe and Schiller, the two Schlegels and Klopstock as well\r\nas the young poets, Uhland and Koerner, were either already at work or\r\nwere about to enter on their distinguished careers, and the neighboring\r\nScandinavian nations were beginning to be seriously affected by the\r\nmovement which was going on among their brethren. In the third year of\r\nhis university course, Oersted entered the lists as a competitor for\r\nliterary honors on the question, \"What are the Limits of Prose and\r\nPoetry?\" and had the satisfaction of winning the gold medal offered for\r\nthe contest. In spite of this episode, indicative of devotedness to the\r\nmuses, Oersted passed a brilliant pharmaceutical examination; and in the\r\nfollowing year succeeded in capturing another prize, this time for a\r\nmedical essay.\r\n\r\nAfter such a period of preparation, it might be expected that a\r\nbrilliant career would open up for Oersted; but, unfortunately, he could\r\nnot afford to wait for slow academic rewards, as it was absolutely\r\nnecessary for him to set about earning his livelihood. For this purpose,\r\nshortly after graduation, he accepted the position of manager of a\r\ndrug-store. As the salary attached to the office was rather slender, he\r\nincreased his resources by giving lectures in the evening on the\r\nfamiliar subjects of chemistry, natural philosophy and metaphysics.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the _wanderlust_, or passion for travel, took\r\npossession of our young philosopher; and under its influence, he\r\nresolved to see for himself what men of scientific avocations were doing\r\nin France and in Germany. His own pinched circumstances would not allow\r\nhim to undertake such a journey; but he was fortunate enough to win a\r\n_stipendium cappelianum_ which allowed him to travel at the expense of\r\nthe government for a period of five years, though he used it only for\r\nthree. If ever pecuniary aid was productive of enduring results, it was\r\nso in this case.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, at the age of twenty-four, Oersted set out from Copenhagen on\r\nhis grand tour, determined to make it a scientific as well as\r\nsentimental journey. In Germany, which he first visited, he met\r\nKlaproth, the orientalist; Werner, the mineralogist; Olbers the\r\nastronomer; the philosophers Fichte, Schelling and the two Schlegels;\r\nand above all, the young and brilliant physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter,\r\nwho discussed with him the theory of the wonderful \"pile\" invented by\r\nVolta in the previous year, 1800.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, Oersted spent about fifteen months, during which time he was\r\nin habitual relations with many of the savants who were just then\r\nreflecting great lustre on French science. To mention but a few: there\r\nwas Cuvier, the leading naturalist of his age; Abbé Haüy,\r\ncrystallographer of world-wide reputation; Biot, the brilliant expounder\r\nof physics; Charles, the discoverer of the law which bears his name;\r\nBerthollet, the associate of Monge the mathematician, and Lavoisier, the\r\nchemist.\r\n\r\nOn his return to the Danish capital in 1804, Oersted delivered courses\r\nof lectures on electricity and magnetism, light and heat, before\r\nnumerous and cultured audiences; and such was the success which he\r\nachieved that he was appointed, at the age of twenty-nine, to the chair\r\nof physics in the University of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nFor nearly forty-five years he was destined to occupy this academical\r\nposition, so that his connection with that seat of learning rounded out\r\nthe full period of half a century.\r\n\r\nWhile sedulously occupied with the duties of his chair and the pursuit\r\nof his favorite scientific subjects, Oersted was not unmindful of his\r\ncivic and altruistic obligations. He frequently gave popular scientific\r\nlectures, which were open to women as well as to men. He helped in the\r\norganization of a bureau through which lectures would be given in\r\nvarious parts of the country, and thus became a pioneer in what we call\r\nto-day the university extension movement. When democratic ideas began to\r\nbe discussed in Denmark after the French Revolution of 1830, Oersted\r\nwas one of those who took part in the onward movement for the betterment\r\nof the people. In 1835, he coöperated in the foundation of the Society\r\nfor the Freedom of the Press; and when Christian VIII. ascended the\r\nthrone, he addressed the new monarch in a speech of liberal tendency,\r\nhailing him because of the interest which he took in the advancement of\r\nscience and in the uplift of the masses.\r\n\r\nAn idea of the position accorded to Oersted by his colleagues in the\r\nworld of science may be gathered from an address made by Sir John\r\nHerschel at the closing session of the Southampton meeting of the\r\nBritish Association in 1836, in which the distinguished astronomer said:\r\n\"In science, there is but one direction which the needle will take when\r\npointed towards the European continent, and that is towards my esteemed\r\nfriend, Professor Oersted. To look at his cool manner, who would think\r\nthat he wielded such an intense power, capable of altering the whole\r\nstate of science, and almost the knowledge of the world? He has at this\r\nmeeting developed some of those recondite and remarkable forces of\r\nnature which he was the first to discover, and which went almost to the\r\nextent of obliging us to alter our views on the most ordinary laws of\r\nenergy and motion. He elaborated his ideas with slowness and certainty,\r\nbringing them forward only after a long lapse of time. How often did I\r\nwish to Heaven that we could trample down, and strike forever to earth,\r\nthe hasty generalizations which mark the present age, and bring up\r\nanother and safer system of investigation, such as that which marked the\r\ninquiries of our friend? It was in deep recesses, as it were, of a cell,\r\nthat a faint idea first occurred to Oersted. He waited long and calmly\r\nfor the dawn which at length broke upon him, altering the whole\r\nrelations of science and life. The electric telegraph and other wonders\r\nof modern science were but mere effervescences from the surface of this\r\ndeep, recondite discovery of his. If we were to characterize, by any\r\nfigure, the usefulness of Oersted to science, we would regard him as a\r\nfertilizing shower descending from heaven, which brought forth a new\r\ncrop, delightful to the eye and pleasing to the heart.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be noticed that in Oersted's day early specialization was\r\nfortunately unknown. His education was broad and his intellectual\r\nactivities broader still. Quite as interesting as many of his scientific\r\nresearches are some of his contributions to philosophy and some of his\r\nviews on the significance of the material universe. Oersted, a man of\r\nthe world with a wide range of interests and a philosopher who lived at\r\nhigh intellectual altitudes, was one of the all-round men in the history\r\nof thought who took active part in science, in literature, in politics\r\nand in social problems. He had the opportunity of meeting many of the\r\nrenowned scientists and philosophers of the century, and had been very\r\nclosely in touch with some of them. He was a regular attendant at\r\nscientific congresses, in which he distinguished himself by the leading\r\npart which he took in their deliberations. His opinions, therefore, on\r\nthe great problems of life, religious, moral, social and political,\r\nchallenge our respect even where they do not compel our approval. Our\r\nDanish philosopher deserves, then, to stand as the spokesman of his\r\ngeneration of savants on the great questions that concern man's\r\nrelations to his fellow-men, to an all-wise Providence and to an\r\nenduring hereafter. His opinions on these matters are all the more\r\ninteresting because they are in open contradiction with what is\r\nsometimes thought to be the views of scientists on such subjects.\r\n\r\nOne of the passages of his paper on \"All Existence, a Dominion of\r\nReason,\" contains some surprising anticipations of ideas that created a\r\ngreat stir in the intellectual world some fifty years ago. In 1846, that\r\nis, thirteen years before the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" Oersted discussed evolution and suggested explanations that\r\nare generally considered to have been forced from apologists when\r\ncompelled to take up the work of reconciling Christian doctrines with\r\nscientific conclusions.\r\n\r\nWriting in the middle 'forties, he said: \"If we are now thoroughly\r\nconvinced that everything in the material world is produced from similar\r\nparticles of matter, by the same forces and in obedience to the same\r\nlaws, we must allow that the planets have been formed according to the\r\nsame laws as our own earth. They have been in process of development\r\nduring immeasurable periods of time, and have undergone numerous\r\ntransformations which have also influenced the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms of those remote periods. The lower forms of life advanced by\r\ngradual stages to higher and more complex states of organization, till\r\nat length (in a comparatively recent period) a self-conscious being was\r\nevolved, the crowning work of this long-continued process of\r\ndevelopment. Accordingly, we must allow a similar order of organic\r\ndevelopment to take place on the other planets of our solar family.\r\nThere may be some which have not as yet attained the same degree of\r\ndevelopment that we have reached; but everywhere throughout the\r\nuniverse, creatures endowed with reason appear in due time, just as man\r\nappeared on our own globe. Their understanding is intimately connected\r\nwith the organs of sense which they possess; therefore, the nature of\r\ntheir mental faculties cannot be essentially different from our own.\r\nThat I may avoid even the appearance of materialism, I must direct\r\nattention to the conciliatory principle, that the natural environment\r\nfrom which man springs must be recognized as the work of the eternal,\r\ncreative Spirit. In other words, our conception of the universe is\r\nincomplete, if not comprehended as a constant and continuous work of the\r\neternally creating Spirit.\"\r\n\r\nThus far Oersted; let us here recall what Lord Kelvin, the\r\nrepresentative scientist of his day, quoted with approval on a memorable\r\noccasion from the Danish scientist with regard to the basic truths of\r\nscience, philosophy and religion. \"It will not be foreign to our purpose\r\nif, called upon by the solemnities of this day, we endeavor to establish\r\nour conviction of the harmony that subsists between religion and\r\nscience, by showing how the man of science must look upon his pursuits,\r\nif he understands them rightly, as an exercise of religion.\r\n\r\n\"If my purpose here was merely to show that science necessarily\r\nengenders piety, I should appeal to the great truth everywhere\r\nrecognized, that the essence of all religion consists in love toward\r\nGod. The conclusion would then be easy, that love of Him from whom all\r\ntruth proceeds must create the desire to acknowledge truth in all her\r\npaths; but as we desire here to recognize science herself as a religious\r\nduty, it will be requisite for us to penetrate deeper into its nature.\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the searching eye of man, whether he\r\nregards his own inward being or the creation surrounding him, is always\r\nled to the Eternal Source of all things. In all inquiry, the ultimate\r\naim is to discover that which really exists and to contemplate it in\r\nits pure light apart from all that deceives the careless observer by\r\nonly a seeming existence. The philosopher will then comprehend what,\r\namidst ceaseless change, is the Constant and Uncreated, which is hidden\r\nbehind unnumbered creations, the bond of union which keeps things\r\ntogether in spite of their manifold divisions and separations. He must\r\nsoon acknowledge that the independent can only be the constant and the\r\nconstant the independent, and that true unity is inseparable from either\r\nof these. And thus it is in the nature of thought that it finds no quiet\r\nresting place, no pause, except in the invariable, eternal, uncaused,\r\nall-causing, all-comprehensive Omniscience.\r\n\r\n\"But, if this one-sided view does not satisfy him, if he seeks to\r\nexamine the world with the eye of experience, he perceives that all\r\nthose things of whose reality the multitude feels most assured never\r\nhave an enduring existence, but are always on the road between birth and\r\ndeath. If he now properly comprehends the whole array of nature, he\r\nperceives that it is not merely an idea or an abstract notion, as it is\r\ncalled; but that reason and the power to which everything is indebted\r\nfor its essential nature are only the revelation of a self-sustained\r\nBeing. How can he, when he sees this, be otherwise animated than by the\r\ndeepest feeling of humility, of devotion and of love? If anyone has\r\nlearned a different lesson from his observation of nature, it could only\r\nbe because he lost his way amidst the dispersion and variety of creation\r\nand had not looked upwards to the eternal unity of truth.\"\r\n\r\nAs already said, Oersted lived to celebrate the fiftieth year of his\r\nconnection with his university. This was in November, 1850, on which\r\noccasion his friends, pupils and the public generally united together\r\nin honoring him as a professor whose warm and animated lectures\r\nenraptured audiences; as a leader in the scientific advance of the\r\ntimes; and as a Christian to whom nature was but a manifestation of the\r\nDeity's combined wisdom and creative power.\r\n\r\nThe aged scientist, much touched by this popular demonstration as well\r\nas by the tokens of esteem given him by the King, spoke of this jubilee\r\ncelebration as the happiest day of his life. The reader will recall\r\nanother great man, great in the world of politics and great on the field\r\nof battle, who said that the happiest day of _his_ life was that of his\r\nfirst communion.\r\n\r\nA few months after celebrating his golden jubilee, Oersted passed away,\r\nafter a short illness, on March 9th, 1851, deeply mourned by all.\r\n\r\nOersted was eminent as a scholar and equally eminent as a man; lenient\r\nin his judgment of others, he was strict with regard to himself; simple\r\nin his ways and frugal in living, he was benevolent to others, being\r\nalways ready to give a helping hand wherever needed. To such a man may\r\nwell be applied these beautiful words with which Priestley begins his\r\n\"History of Electricity\": \"A life spent in the contemplation of the\r\nproductions of divine power, wisdom and goodness, would be a life of\r\ndevotion. The more we see of the wonderful structure of the world and of\r\nthe laws of nature, the more clearly do we comprehend their admirable\r\nuses to make all percipient creation happy, a sentiment which cannot but\r\nfill the heart with unbounded love, gratitude and joy.\"\r\n\r\nA statue to the memory of Oersted was unveiled in Copenhagen on\r\nSeptember 25th, 1876, in presence of the King of Denmark, the King of\r\nGreece, the Danish Crown Prince and members of the Royal family, as well\r\nas numerous high officials, representatives of learned societies and a\r\nvast body of students and people assembled together to do honor to a man\r\nwho was distinguished alike by his scientific attainments and\r\nphilosophical acumen, and who, during his long life, never faltered in\r\nhis devotedness to the welfare of his country as he never weakened in\r\nhis defense of the great truths of religion.\r\n\r\nBROTHER POTAMIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nANDRÉ MARIE AMPÈRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew men of the nineteenth century are so interesting as André Marie\r\nAmpère, who is, as we have seen, deservedly spoken of as the founder of\r\nthe science of electro-dynamics. Extremely precocious as a boy, so that,\r\nlike his immediate predecessor in discovery, Oersted the Dane, his rapid\r\nintellectual development drew down upon him ominous expressions from\r\nthose who knew him, he more than fulfilled the highest promise of his\r\nearly years. His was no one-sided genius. He was interested in\r\neverything, and his memory was as retentive as his intellect was\r\ncomprehensive. He grew up, indeed, to be a young man of the widest\r\npossible interests. Literature never failed to have its attraction for\r\nhim, though science was his favorite study and mathematics his hobby.\r\nThe mathematical mind is commonly supposed to run in very precise\r\ngrooves, yet Ampère was always a speculator, and his speculations were\r\nmost suggestive for his contemporaries and subsequent generations.\r\nIndeed, his mathematics, far from being a hindrance to his penetrating\r\noutlook upon the hazier confines of science, rather seemed to help the\r\npenetrations it gave. While he was so great a scientist that Arago, so\r\nlittle likely to exaggerate his French contemporary's merit, has said of\r\nAmpère's discovery identifying magnetism and electricity, that \"the vast\r\nfield of physical science perhaps never presented so brilliant a\r\ndiscovery, conceived, verified, and completed with such rapidity,\" his\r\nfriends knew this great scientist as one of the kindliest and most\r\ngenial of men, noted for his simplicity, his persuasive sympathy and his\r\ntender regard for all those with whom he was brought into intimate\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ANDRÉ MARIE AMPÈRE]\r\n\r\nThe commonly accepted formula for a great scientist, that he is a man\r\nwrapt up in himself and his work, enmeshed so completely in the\r\nscientific speculations that occupy him that he has little or no time\r\nfor great humanitarian interests, so that his human sympathies are\r\nlikely to atrophy, is entirely contradicted by the life of Ampère. He\r\nwas no narrow specialist, and, indeed, it may be said that not a single\r\none of these great discoverers in electricity whom we are considering in\r\nthis volume was of the type that is sometimes accepted as indicative of\r\nscientific genius and originality. After reading their lives, one is\r\nprone to have the feeling that men who lack that wider sympathy which,\r\nin the famous words of the old Latin poet, makes everything human of\r\ninterest to them, are not of the mental calibre to make supreme\r\ndiscoveries, even though they may succeed in creating a large amount of\r\ninterest in their scientific speculations in their own generation. It is\r\nthe all-round man who does supreme original work of enduring quality.\r\n\r\nAndré Marie Ampère was born at Lyons, January 22d, 1775. His father,\r\nJean Jacques Ampère, was a small merchant who made a comfortable living\r\nfor his family, but no more. His father and mother were both well\r\ninformed for their class and time, and were well esteemed by their\r\nneighbors. His mother especially was known for an unalterable sweetness\r\nof character and charitable beneficence which sought out every possible\r\noccasion for its exercise. She was universally beloved by those who knew\r\nher, and the charm of Ampère's manner, which made for him a friend of\r\nevery acquaintance, was undoubtedly a manifestation of the same family\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nShortly after the birth of their son, the parents gave up business and\r\nretired on a little property situated in the country not far from Lyons.\r\nIt was in this little village, without any school-teacher and with only\r\nhome instruction, that the genius of the future savant, who was to be\r\none of the distinguished scientific men of the nineteenth century, began\r\nto show itself. For Ampère was not only a genius, but, what is so often\r\nthought to be an almost absolute preclusion of any serious achievement\r\nlater in life, a precocious genius. The first marvelous faculty that\r\nbegan to develop in him was an uncontrollable tendency to arithmetical\r\nexpression. Before he knew how to make figures, he had invented for\r\nhimself a method of doing even rather complicated problems in arithmetic\r\nby the aid of a number of pebbles or peas. During an illness that\r\novertook him as a child, his mother, anxious because of the possible\r\nevil effects upon his health of mental work, took his pebbles away from\r\nhim. He supplied their place, however, during the leisure hours of his\r\nconvalescence, when time hung heavy on his child hands, by bread crumbs.\r\nHe craved food, but, according to the \"starving\" medical _régime_ of the\r\ntime, he was allowed only a single biscuit in three days. It required no\r\nlittle self-sacrifice on his part, then, to supply himself with counters\r\nfrom this scanty supply, and his persistence, in spite of hunger,\r\nevidently indicates that this mathematical tendency was stronger than\r\nhis appetite for food. This is all the more surprising, since children\r\nare usually scarcely more than little animals in the matter of eating,\r\nand commonly satisfy their physical cravings without an after-thought of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\nAmpère learned to read when but very young, and then began to devour all\r\nthe books which came to hand. Usually, the precocious taste for reading\r\nspecializes on some particular subject; but everything was grist that\r\ncame to the child Ampère's mental mill, and it was all ground up; and,\r\nstrangest of all, much of it was assimilated. Travel, history, poetry,\r\noccupied him quite as much as romance; and, amazing as it may appear,\r\neven philosophy was not disdained while he was still under ten years of\r\nage. It seems amusing to read the declaration of the French biographer,\r\nthat if this boy of ten had any special predilection in literature, it\r\nwas for Homer, Lucan, Tasso, Fénelon, Corneille and Voltaire, yet it\r\nmust be taken seriously.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about fifteen, this omnivorous intellectual genius came\r\nacross a French encyclopedia in twenty folio volumes. This seemed to him\r\na veritable Golconda of endless riches of information. Each of the\r\nvolumes had its turn. The second was begun as soon as the first was\r\nfinished, and the reading of the third followed, and so on, until every\r\none of the volumes had been completely read. References to other volumes\r\nmight be looked up occasionally, but this did not distract him into\r\ntaking other portions of the works out of alphabetical order. Surprising\r\nas it must seem, most of this heterogeneous mass of information, far\r\nfrom being forgotten at once, was deeply engraved on his wonderful\r\nmemory. More than once in after-life, when many years had passed, it was\r\na surprise to his friends to find how much information Ampère had\r\namassed on some abstruse and unfamiliar subject, and how readily he was\r\nable to pour forth details of information that seemed quite out of his\r\nline. He would then confess that the encyclopedia article on the\r\nsubject, read so many years before, was still fresh in his mind, or at\r\nleast that its information was so stored away as to be readily\r\navailable. We have heard much of Gladstone's memory in more recent\r\nyears; but that seems to have been nothing compared to this wonderful\r\nfaculty which recalled for Ampère, even as an old man, the unrelated\r\ndetails of every encyclopedia article that had passed under his eyes\r\nhalf a century before, when he was a boy of ten to fourteen.\r\n\r\nThe modest family library soon proved utterly insufficient to occupy the\r\nmind of this young, enthusiastic student; and his father, sympathetic\r\nto his ardent curiosity, took him to Lyons from time to time, where he\r\nmight have the opportunity to consult volumes of various kinds that\r\nmight catch his fancy. At this time, his old mathematical tendency\r\nreasserted itself. He wished to learn something about the higher\r\nmathematics. He found in a library in Lyons the works of Bernoulli and\r\nof Euler. When the delicate-looking boy, whom the librarian considered\r\nlittle more than a child, put in his request to the town library for\r\nthese serious mathematical works, the old gentleman said to him: \"The\r\nworks of Bernoulli and Euler! What are you thinking of, my little\r\nfriend? These works figure among the most difficult writings that ever\r\ncame from the mind of man.\" \"I hope to be able to understand them,\"\r\nreplied the boy. \"I suppose you know,\" said the librarian, \"that they\r\nare written in Latin.\" This was a disagreeable surprise for young\r\nAmpère. As yet he had not studied Latin. He went home, resolved,\r\nhowever, to remove this hindrance to his study of the higher\r\nmathematics. At the end of the month, owing to his assiduity, the\r\nobstacle had entirely disappeared; and though he could read only\r\nmathematical Latin and had later to study the language from another\r\nstandpoint, in order to understand the classics, he was now able to\r\npursue the study of mathematics in Latin to his heart's content.\r\n\r\nThe even tenor of the boy's life, deeply engaged as he was in studies of\r\nevery description, was destined to be very seriously disturbed. When he\r\nwas but fourteen, in 1789, the Revolution came, with its glorious\r\npromise and then its awful consummation. Ampère's father was seriously\r\nalarmed at the revolutionary course things were taking in France, and\r\nhad the fatal inspiration to leave his country home and betake himself\r\nto the city of Lyons. For a time, he occupied a position as magistrate.\r\nAfter the siege of Lyons, the revolutionary tribunal established there\r\ntook up the project of making the Lyonnese patriotic, as they called it,\r\nby properly punishing the citizens for their failure to sympathize at\r\nfirst with the revolutionary government, and soon a series of horrible\r\nmassacres began. New victims were claimed every day, and Ampère's father\r\nwas one of those who had to suffer. The real reason for his condemnation\r\nwas that he had accepted a position under the old government, though the\r\npretext stated on the warrant for his arrest was that he was an\r\naristocrat. This is the only evidence we have that the Ampère family was\r\nin any way connected with the nobility. The day on which he was\r\nsentenced to die, Jean Jacques Ampère wrote to his wife a letter of\r\nsublime simplicity, in which his Christian resignation of spirit, his\r\nlofty courage, yet thoroughly practical commonsense, are manifest. He\r\nwarned his wife to say nothing about his fate to their daughter\r\nJosephine, though he hoped that his son would be better able to stand\r\nthe blow, and perhaps prove a consolation to his mother.\r\n\r\nThe news proved almost too much for the young Ampère, and for a time his\r\nreason was despaired of. All his faculties seemed to be shocked for the\r\nmoment into insensibility. Biographers tell us that he wandered around,\r\nbuilding little piles of sand, gazing idly at the stars or vacantly into\r\nspace, wearing scarcely any of the expression of a rational being. His\r\nfriends could harbor only the worst possible expectations for him, and\r\neven his physical health suffered so much that it seemed he would not\r\nlong survive. One day, by chance, Rousseau's \"Letters on Botany\" fell\r\ninto his hands. They caught his attention, and he became interested in\r\ntheir charming narrative style, and as a result, his reason awoke once\r\nmore. He began to study botany in the field, and soon acquired a taste\r\nfor the reading of Linnæus. At the same time, classic poetry, especially\r\nsuch as contained descriptions of nature, once more appealed to him, and\r\nso he took up his classical studies. He varied the reading of the poets\r\nwith dissections of flowers, and yet succeeded in following both sets of\r\nstudies so attentively that, forty years afterward, he was still\r\nperfectly capable of taking up the technical description of the plants\r\nthat he had then studied, and while acting as a university inspector, he\r\ncomposed 150 Latin verses during his horseback rides from one inspection\r\ndistrict to another, without ever having to consult a gradus or a\r\ndictionary for the quantities, yet without making a single mistake. His\r\nmemory for subjects once learned, was almost literally infallible.\r\n\r\nSomething of his love for nature can be appreciated from an incident of\r\nhis early manhood, which is not without its amusing side. Ampère was\r\nvery near-sighted, and had been able to read books all his life only by\r\nholding them very close to his eyes. This makes it all the more\r\ndifficult to understand how he succeeded in reading so much. His\r\nnear-sightedness was so marked that he had no idea of beauties of\r\nscenery beyond him, and was often rather put out at the enthusiastic\r\ndescription of scenes through which he passed _en diligence_, when his\r\nfellow-travelers spoke of the beauties of the scenes around them.\r\nAmpère, like most people who do not share, or at least appreciate, the\r\nenthusiasm of others for beautiful things around them, was in this\r\nmood, mainly because he was not able to see them in the way that others\r\ndid, and, therefore, could not have the same pleasure in them. This lack\r\nin himself was unconscious, of course, as in all other cases, and, far\r\nfrom lessening, rather emphasized the tendency to be impatient with\r\nothers, and rather made him more ready to think how foolish they were to\r\ngo into ecstasies over something that to him was so insignificant.\r\n\r\nOne day, while Ampère was making the journey along the Saone into Lyons,\r\nit happened that there sat beside him on the stage-coach a young man who\r\nsuffered from near-sightedness very nearly in the same degree as Ampère\r\nhimself, but whose myopia had been corrected by means of properly\r\nfitting glasses. These glasses were just exactly what Ampère needed in\r\norder to correct his vision completely. The young fellows became\r\ninterested in each other, and, during the course of their conversation,\r\nhis companion suggested to Ampère, seeing how near-sighted he was, that\r\nhe should try his glasses. He put them on, and at once nature presented\r\nherself to him under an entirely different aspect. The vision was so\r\nunexpected, that the description which he had so often heard from his\r\nfellow-travelers, but could not appreciate, now recurred to him, and he\r\ncould not help exclaiming in raptures, \"Oh! what a smiling country! What\r\npicturesque, graceful hills! How the rich, warm tones are harmoniously\r\nblended in the wonderful union of sky and mountain vista!\" All of these\r\nnow spoke emphatically to his delicate sensibility, and a new world was\r\nliterally revealed to him. Ampère was so overcome by this unexpected\r\nsight, which gave him so much pleasure, that he burst into tears from\r\ndepth of emotion, and could not satisfy himself with looking at all the\r\nbeauties of nature that had been hidden from him for so long. Ever\r\nafter, natural scenery was one of the greatest pleasures that he had in\r\nlife, and the beauties of nature, near or distant, meant more to him\r\nthan any other gratification of the senses.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that Ampère had devoted considerable attention to\r\nacoustics as a young man, and had studied the ways in which the waves of\r\nair by which sounds are formed and propagated, he had absolutely no ear\r\nfor music, and was as tone-deaf as he had been blind before his\r\ndiscovery with regard to the glasses. Musical notes constituted a\r\nmathematical problem for Ampère, but nothing more. This continued to be\r\nthe case until about thirty years of age. Then, one day, he attended a\r\nmusical soirée, at which the principal portions of the program were\r\ntaken from Glück. It is easy to understand that this master of harmony\r\npossessed no charms for a tone-deaf young man. He became uneasy during\r\nthe course of the musical program, and his uneasiness became manifest to\r\nothers. After the selections of the German composer were finished,\r\nhowever, some simple but charming melodies were unexpectedly introduced,\r\nand Ampère suddenly found himself transported into a new world. If we\r\nare to believe his biographers, once more his emotion was expressed by\r\nan abundance of tears, which Ampère seems to have had at command and to\r\nhave been quite as ready to give way to in public as any of Homer's\r\nheroes of the olden time. Blind until he was nearly twenty, he used to\r\nsay of himself, he had been deaf until he was thirty. In spite of his\r\nfailure to respond in youth, once it had been awakened to appreciation,\r\nhis soul vibrated profoundly to all the beauties of color and sound,\r\nand, later in life, they gave rise in him to depths of emotion which\r\ncalmer individuals of less delicate sensibilities could scarcely\r\nunderstand, much less sympathize with.\r\n\r\nBetween his two supreme experiences in vision and sound, there had come\r\nto Ampère another and even profounder emotion. He tells the story\r\nhimself, in words that probably express his feelings better than any\r\npossible description of his biographer could do, and that show us how\r\nwonderfully sensitive his soul was to emotion of all kinds. He had just\r\ncompleted his twenty-first year when he fell head over heels in love.\r\nThough he wrote very little, as a rule, he has left us a rather detailed\r\ndescription in diaries, evidently kept for the purpose, of the state of\r\nhis feelings at this time. These bear the title, \"_Amorum_,\" the story\r\nof his love. On the first page these words occur: \"One day as I was\r\ntaking an evening walk, just after the setting of the sun, making my way\r\nalong a little brook,\" then there is a hiatus, and he was evidently\r\nquite unable to express all that he felt. It seems that he was gathering\r\nbotanical specimens, wearing an excellent set of spectacles ever since\r\nhis adventure on the stage-coach had shown him the need of them, when he\r\nsuddenly perceived at some distance two young and charming girls who\r\nwere gathering flowers in the field. He looked at one of them, and he\r\nknew that his fate was sealed. Up to that time, as he says, the idea of\r\nmarriage had never occurred to him. One might think that the idea would\r\noccur very gently at first, then grow little by little; but that was not\r\nAmpère's way. He wanted to marry her that very day. He did not know her\r\nname; he did not know her family; he had never even heard her voice, but\r\nhe knew that she was the destined one.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the young lady and himself, she had very sensible\r\nparents. They demanded how he would be able to support a wife. Ampère\r\nwas quite willing to do anything that they should suggest. His father\r\nhad left enough to support the family, but not enough to enable him to\r\nsupport a wife in an independent home; and until he had some occupation,\r\nthe parents of his bride-to-be refused to listen to his representations.\r\nFor a time, he consented to be a salesman in a silk store in Lyons, in\r\norder to have some occupation which might eventually give him enough\r\nmoney to enable him to marry. Fortunately, however, he was diverted from\r\na commercial vocation which might thus have absorbed a great scientist,\r\nand arrangements were made which permitted him to continue his\r\nintellectual life, yet have the woman of his choice. She was destined to\r\nmake life happier far for him than is the usual lot of man, and he was\r\never ready to acknowledge how much she meant for his happiness.\r\n\r\nWith literature, poetry, love and settling down in life to occupy him,\r\nit is hard to think of Ampère as a young man doing great work in\r\nscience, but he did; and his work deservedly attracted attention even\r\nfrom his very early years. It was in pure mathematics, perhaps, above\r\nall other branches, that Ampère attracted the attention of his\r\ngeneration. Ordinary questions he did not care for. Problems which the\r\nfruitless efforts of twenty centuries had pronounced insoluble attracted\r\nhim at once. Even the squaring of the circle claimed his attention for a\r\nwhile, though he got well beyond it even before his boyhood passed away.\r\nThere is a manuscript note from the Secretary of the Academy of Lyons,\r\nwhich shows that on July 8th, 1788, Ampère, then not quite thirteen\r\nyears of age, addressed to that learned body a paper on the \"Squaring of\r\nthe Circle.\" Later, during the same year, he submitted an analogous\r\nmemoir, entitled, \"The Rectification of an Arc of a Circle, less than a\r\nSemi-circumference.\"\r\n\r\nArago says that he was tempted to suppress this story of Ampère's\r\ncoquetting with so dangerous a problem, for Ampère rather flattered\r\nhimself that he had almost solved it. It was only after Arago recalled\r\nhow many geniuses in mathematics had occupied themselves with this same\r\nproblem, that he saw his way clearly not to share the scruples of those\r\nwho might think this incident a reflection on Ampère's mathematical\r\ngenius. After all, Anaxagoras, Hippocrates, Archimedes and Apollonius,\r\namong the ancients, and among the moderns, Willebrod Snell, Huyghens,\r\nGregory, Wallis, and finally Newton, the mathematician of the heavens,\r\noccupied themselves seriously with this very problem. Arago even notes\r\nthat some men, by their speculations on the squaring of the circle, were\r\nled to distinguished discoveries, and mentions the name of Father\r\nGrégoire de Saint-Vincent, the distinguished Flemish mathematician of\r\nthe Society of Jesus, to whom, as a direct result of his studies in\r\nattempted circle-squaring, we owe the discovery of the properties of\r\nhyperbolic space, limited by the curve and its asymptotes, as well as\r\nthe expansion of log (1 + _x_) in ascending powers of _x_. Montucla, the\r\nhistorian of mathematics, writing of Père Saint-Vincent, said that, \"No\r\none ever squared the circle with so much ability or with so much\r\nsuccess.\" There was, however, a fallacy in his magnificent work which\r\nwas pointed out by the celebrated Huyghens.\r\n\r\nShortly after the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ampère, as one of\r\nhis French biographers rather characteristically declares, redeemed\r\nwhatever of mathematical sinning there might have been, in indulging in\r\nfond dalliance with the squaring of the circle, by a series of\r\nmathematical papers, each of which was in itself a distinct advance on\r\nprevious knowledge, and at the same time, definite evidence of his\r\nmathematical ability. The first paper, published in 1801, was a\r\ncontribution to solid geometry, bearing the title, \"On Oblique\r\nPolyhedrons.\" His next paper, written in 1803, though not published\r\nuntil 1808, was a treatise on the advantages to be derived in the theory\r\nof curves from due consideration of the osculating parabola. Another\r\ntreatise, written about the same time, had for title, \"Investigations on\r\nthe Application of the General Formulæ of the Calculus of Variations to\r\nProblems in Mechanics.\" This concerned problems which had interested\r\nand, in most cases, proved too hard of solution even for such men as\r\nGalileo, Jacques Bernoulli, Leibnitz, Huyghens and Jean Bernoulli.\r\nArago's expression with regard to this work is: \"The treatise of Ampère\r\ncontains, in fact, new and very remarkable properties of the _catenary_\r\n(la chainette) and its development.\" He adds: \"There is no small merit\r\nin discovering hiatuses in subjects explored by such men as Leibnitz,\r\nHuyghens and the two Bernoullis. I must not forget to add that the\r\nanalysis of our associate unites elegance with simplicity.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, after such marks of mathematical genius, that\r\nAmpère was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the École\r\nPolytechnique, where he came to be looked upon as one of the most\r\ndistinguished of French mathematicians. In 1813, he became a candidate\r\nfor the position left vacant by the death of the famous Lagrange; and at\r\nthis time, presented to the Academy general considerations on the\r\nintegration of partial differential equations of the first and the\r\nsecond order. After his election to the Academy, Ampère continued to\r\npresent important papers at its various sessions. Among these, three are\r\nespecially noteworthy: one was a demonstration of Père Mariotte's law\r\n(known to English students as Boyle's law); another bore the title,\r\n\"Demonstration of a new Theory from which can be deduced all the Laws of\r\nRefraction, ordinary and extraordinary\"; a third was a memoir on the\r\n\"Determination of the curved surfaces of Luminous Waves in a medium\r\nwhose Elasticity differs in each of the three dimensions.\"\r\n\r\nIn his eulogy of Ampère, which, together with his article in the\r\n\"Dictionnaire Universelle de Biographie,\" we have followed rather\r\nclosely, Arago calls particular attention to the fact that in Paris,\r\nAmpère moved in two intellectual circles quite widely separated in their\r\ninterests and sympathies. Among the first group, were the members of the\r\nold \"Institute\" and professors and examiners of the École Polytechnique\r\nand professors of the Collège de France. In the other, were the men\r\nwhose names have since become widely known as students of psychology, of\r\nwhom Cabanis may be taken as the representative. Ampère had as great a\r\npassion for psychology, and was as ready to devote himself to fathoming\r\nand analyzing the mysteries of the mind, as he was to work out a problem\r\nin advanced mathematics, or throw light on difficult questions in the\r\nphysical sciences. These two sets of interests are seldom united in the\r\nsame man, though occasionally they are found. At the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, we had the spectacle of very distinguished men of\r\nscience in physics, and even in biology--Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver\r\nLodge, Professor Charles Richet, Professor Lombroso and even Mr. Alfred\r\nRussell Wallace--interested in psychic and spiritualistic manifestations\r\nof many kinds as well as in natural science; and, inasmuch as they did\r\nso, they would have found Ampère a brother spirit. Ampère indeed dived\r\nrather deeply into what would be called, somewhat slightingly, perhaps,\r\nin our generation, metaphysical speculation. At one time, he\r\ncontemplated the publication of a book which was to be called \"An\r\nIntroduction to Philosophy.\" He had made elaborate theories with regard\r\nto many metaphysical questions, and had written articles on \"The Theory\r\nof Relations,\" \"The History of Existence,\" \"Subjective and Objective\r\nKnowledge\" and \"Absolute Morality.\" Arago calls attention to the fact\r\nthat Napoleon's famous anathema against ideology, far from discouraging\r\nAmpère, rather seemed to stimulate him in his studies, and he declared\r\nthat it would surely contribute to the propagation of this kind of\r\nspeculation, rather than to its suppression. It was simply another case\r\nof Napoleon overreaching himself, though this was in the domain of ideas\r\nand not in the realm of politics, where his fate was to reach him some\r\ntime later.\r\n\r\nHow deeply interested Ampère became in metaphysics will perhaps be best\r\nappreciated from the fact that, for progress in metaphysics, exercise in\r\ndisputation is needed, and had been the custom in the old medieval\r\nuniversities. Ampère once made an arrangement to travel from Paris to\r\nLyons and stay there for some time, provided a definite promise was made\r\nthat at least four afternoons a week should be devoted to discussions\r\non ideology. The journey to Lyons, a distance of two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles, was no easy undertaking in those days. The Paris, Lyons and\r\nMediterranean Express now whirls one down to the capital of the silk\r\ndistrict in a night; but in Ampère's time, it took many days, and the\r\njourney was by no means without inconveniences, which were likely to be\r\nso troublesome that a prolonged rest was needed after it was over.\r\nAmpère seems quite to have exhausted the interest of his friends in\r\nLyons, who found his metaphysical speculations too high for them, though\r\nthey themselves were specializing in the subject and would be glad to\r\ntempt him into discussions of the exact sciences; but in lyrical strain\r\nhe apostrophizes psychological studies: \"How can I abandon the country,\r\nthe flowers and running waters for the arid streets of the city! How\r\ngive up streams and groves for deserts scorched by the rays of a\r\nmathematical sun, which, diffusing over all surrounding objects the most\r\nbrilliant light, withers and dries them down to the very roots! How much\r\nmore agreeable to wander under flitting shades, where truth seems to\r\nflee before us to incite us to pursue, than walk in straight paths where\r\nthe eye embraces all at a glance!\"\r\n\r\nHad Ampère been less successful as a mathematician or an investigator of\r\nphysical science, these expressions would seem little short of\r\nridiculous. As it is, they provide food for thought. Ampère seemed to\r\nrealize that, for the intellectual man, the only satisfaction was not in\r\nsuccessful research so much as in application of mind to what promised\r\nresults. As in everything else, it was the chase, and not the capture,\r\nthat counted. Seldom has this idea been applied to intellectual things\r\nwith so much force as it seems to have appealed to Ampère, and one is\r\nreminded of Malebranche's famous expression, \"If I had truth in my hand,\r\nI would be tempted to let it go for the pleasure of recapturing it.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal source of Ampère's fame, however, for future generations,\r\nwas to be in his researches in the science of electro-dynamics. The name\r\nof this science will ever be inseparably linked with that of Ampère, its\r\nfounder. It was for that reason, of course, that the International\r\nCongress of Electricians decided to give his name to the unit of current\r\nstrength, so that it has now become a household word, and will continue\r\nso for ages to come. In spite of the resemblances, much more than\r\nsuperficial, between magnetism and electricity, the identification of\r\nthese two with each other seemed as yet very distant. It is curiously\r\ninteresting, however, to note that Ampère himself, in a program of his\r\ncourse, printed in 1802, announced that the \"professor will demonstrate\r\nthat electrical and magnetic phenomena must be attributed to two\r\ndifferent fluids which act independently of each other.\" Ampère's fame\r\nwas to be founded on the direct contradiction of this proposition, which\r\nhe proposed and triumphantly defended by a marvelous series of\r\nexperimental illustrations eighteen years later. In the meantime, the\r\ndiscovery of another distinguished scientist, doing his work many\r\nhundreds of miles away, was to prove the stimulus to Ampère's\r\nconstructive imagination, so as to enable him to fill out many obscure\r\npoints of knowledge with regard to magnetism and electricity.\r\n\r\nThis suggestive discovery was that of Oersted, the sketch of whose life\r\nand work immediately precedes this. Oersted demonstrated that a current\r\nof electricity will affect a magnetic needle. This epoch-making\r\ndiscovery reached Paris by way of Switzerland. The experiment was\r\nrepeated before the French Academy of Sciences by a member of the\r\nAcademy of Geneva, on September 11th, 1820. The date has some importance\r\nin the history of science, for just seven days later, on the 18th of\r\nSeptember, Ampère presented, at the session of the Academy of Sciences,\r\na still more important fact, to which he had been led by the\r\nconsideration of Oersted's discovery while testing it by way of control\r\nexperiment. This brilliant discovery of Ampère, Arago summed up in these\r\nwords: \"Two parallel conducting wires attract each other when the\r\ncurrent traverses them in the same direction. On the contrary, they\r\nrepel each other when the current flows in opposite directions. The\r\nphenomenon described by Oersted was called, very appropriately,\r\nelectromagnetic, whilst the phenomena described by Ampère, in which the\r\nmagnet played no part, received at his suggestion the general name of\r\nelectro-dynamics, which has since been applied to them.\"\r\n\r\nAt first it was said that these phenomena were nothing more than\r\nmanifestations of the ordinary attractive and repelling power of the two\r\nforms of electricity which had been so carefully studied, especially in\r\nFrance, during the eighteenth century. Ampère at once disposed of any\r\nsuch idea as this, however, by pointing out that bodies similarly\r\nelectrified repel each other, whilst those that are in opposite\r\nelectrical states attract each other. In the case of conductors\r\nconveying currents, there is attraction when these are in the same\r\ndirection, and repulsion when they flow in the opposite direction. This\r\nreasoning absolutely precluded all possibility of further doubt in the\r\nmatter, and this particular form of objection to Ampère's discoveries\r\nwas dropped at once.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfactorily disposed of other objections, Ampère was content\r\nneither to rest quietly in his discovery nor merely to develop various\r\nexperimental phases of it which would be extremely interesting and\r\npopularly attractive, but which at the same time might mean very little\r\nfor science. With his mathematical mind, Ampère resolved to work out a\r\nmathematical theory which would embrace not only all the phenomena of\r\nmagnetism then known, but also the complete theory of the science of\r\nelectro-dynamics. Needless to say, such a problem was extremely\r\ndifficult. Arago has compared it to Newton's solution of the problem of\r\ngravitation by mathematics. Considering the comparatively small amount\r\nof data that Ampère had at his command, this problem might very well be\r\ncompared to that which Leverrier took up with so much success, when he\r\nset about discovering by calculation only the planet Neptune, as yet\r\nunknown, which was disturbing the movements of Uranus.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that these discoveries of Ampère would be welcomed\r\nwith great enthusiasm. As a matter of fact, however, new discoveries\r\nthat are really novel always have, as almost their surest index, the\r\nfact that contemporaries refuse to accept them. The more versed a man is\r\nin the science in which the discovery comes, the more likely is he to\r\ndelay his acceptance of the novelty. This is not so surprising, since,\r\nas a rule, new discoveries are nearly always very simple expressions of\r\ngreat truths that seem obvious once they are accepted, yet have never\r\nbeen thought of. They mean, therefore, that men who consider themselves\r\ndistinguished in a particular science have missed some easily\r\ndiscoverable phenomenon or its full significance, and so, to accept a\r\nnew discovery in their department of learning men must confess their own\r\nlack of foresight.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that the same thing happened with regard to Ohm,\r\nonly it was much more serious. Years of Ohm's life were wasted because\r\nof the refusal of his contemporaries to accept his \"law\" at his\r\nvaluation. Arago, in his life of Ampère, recalls that when Fresnel\r\ndiscovered the transverse character of waves of light, his observations\r\ncreated the same doubts and uncertainty in the same individuals who a\r\nfew years later refused to accept Ampère's conclusions. Arago puts it,\r\nthat as he was ambitious of a high place in the world of ideas, he\r\nshould have expected to find his adversaries precisely those already\r\noccupying the highest places.\r\n\r\nAmpère never looked on himself as a mere specialist in physical science,\r\nhowever, and it is extremely interesting to know that he dared to take\r\nsides in a discussion between Cuvier and Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, with\r\nregard to the unity of structure in organized beings. While the purely\r\nphysical scientists mostly sat mute during the discussion, Ampère took\r\nan active share in it, and ventured to subject himself to what perhaps,\r\nabove all things, a Frenchman dreads, the ridicule of his colleagues.\r\nArago thought that he held his own very well in this discussion, which\r\ninvolved some of the ideas that were afterwards to be the subject of\r\nprofound study and prolonged investigation later in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, because of the announcement of the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nAfter his discoveries in electricity Ampère came to be acknowledged as\r\none of the greatest of living scientists, and was honored as such by\r\nmost of the distinguished scientific societies of Europe. His work was\r\nnot confined to electricity alone, however, and late in life he prepared\r\nwhat has been well called a remarkable work on the classification of the\r\nsciences. This showed that, far from being a mere electrical specialist\r\nor even a profound thinker in physics, he understood better probably\r\nthan any man of his time the interrelations of the sciences to one\r\nanother. He was a broad-minded, profound thinker in the highest sense of\r\nthe words, and in many things seems to have had almost an intuition of\r\nthe intimate processes of nature; a sharer in secrets as yet unrevealed,\r\nthough he was at the same time an untiring experimenter, eminently\r\nsuccessful, as is so evident in his electrical researches, in arranging\r\nexperiments so as to compel answers to the questions which he put to\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this preoccupation of mind with science and all the\r\nscientific problems that were working in men's minds in his time, from\r\nthe constitution of matter to the nature of life, above all engaged in\r\nexperimental work, he was a deeply religious man in his opinions and\r\npractices. He had indeed the simple piety of a child. During the awful\r\nperiod of the French Revolution, he had some doubts with regard to\r\nreligious truths; but once these were dispelled, he became one of the\r\nmost faithful practical Catholics of his generation. He seldom passed a\r\nday without finding his way into a church, and his favorite form of\r\nprayer was the rosary.\r\n\r\nFrederick Ozanam tells the story of how he himself, overtaken by\r\nmisgivings with regard to faith, and roaming almost aimlessly through\r\nthe streets of Paris trying to think out solutions for his doubts, and\r\nthe problems that would so insistently present themselves respecting the\r\nintellectual foundations of Christianity, finally wandered one day into\r\na church, and found Ampère there in an obscure corner, telling his\r\nbeads. Ozanam himself was moved to do the same thing, for Ampère was\r\nthen looked upon as one of the greatest living scientists of France.\r\nUnder the magic touch of an example like this and the quiet influence of\r\nprayer, Ozanam's doubts vanished, never to return.\r\n\r\nSaint-Beuve, whose testimony in a matter like this would surely be\r\nunsuspected of any tendency to make Ampère more Catholic than he was, in\r\nhis introduction to Ampère's essay on the Philosophy of the Sciences\r\n(Paris, 1843), says:\r\n\r\n\"The religious struggles and doubts of his earlier life had ceased. What\r\ndisturbed him now lay in less exalted regions. Years ago, his interior\r\nconflicts, his instinctive yearning for the Eternal, and a lively\r\ncorrespondence with his old friend, Father Barrett, combined with the\r\ngeneral tendency of the time of the Restoration, had led him back to\r\nthat faith and devotion which he expressed so strikingly in 1803....\r\nDuring the years which followed, up to the time of his death, we were\r\nfilled with wonder and admiration at the way in which, without effort,\r\nhe united religion and science; faith and confidence in the intellectual\r\npossibilities of man with adoring submission to the revealed word of\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nOzanam, to whose thoroughly practical Christianity while he was\r\nprofessor of Foreign Literatures at the University of Paris we owe the\r\nfoundation of the Conferences of St. Vincent de Paul, which so long\r\nanticipated the \"settlement work\" of the modern time and have done so\r\nmuch for the poor in large cities ever since, was very close to Ampère,\r\nlived with him indeed for a while, said that, no matter where\r\nconversations with him began, they always led up to God. The great\r\nFrench scientist and philosopher used to take his broad forehead between\r\nhis hands after he had been discussing some specially deep question of\r\nscience or philosophy and say: \"How great is God, Ozanam! How great is\r\nGod and how little is our knowledge!\" Of course this has been the\r\nexpression of most profound thinkers at all times. St. Augustine's\r\nfamous vision of the angel standing by the sea emptying it out with a\r\nteaspoon, which has been rendered so living for most of us by\r\nBotticelli's great picture, is but an earlier example of the same thing.\r\nOne of Ampère's greatest contemporaries, Laplace, re-echoed the same\r\nsentiment, perhaps in less striking terms, when he declared that what we\r\nknow is but little, while what we do not know is infinite.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who desires to study the beautiful Christian simplicity of a\r\ntruly great soul, there is no better human document than the \"Journal\r\nand Correspondence of Ampère,\" published some years after his death. He\r\nhimself wrote out the love story of his life; and it is perhaps one of\r\nthe most charming of narratives, certainly the most delightful\r\nautobiographic story of this kind that has ever been told. It is human\r\nto the very core, and it shows a wonderfully sympathetic character in a\r\ngreat man, whose work was destined a few years later to revolutionize\r\nphysics and to found the practical science of electro-dynamics.\r\n\r\nWhen Ampère's death was impending, it was suggested that a chapter of\r\nthe \"Imitation of Christ\" should be read to him; but he said, no!\r\ndeclaring that he preferred to be left alone for a while, as he knew\r\nthe \"Imitation\" by heart and would repeat those chapters in which he\r\nfound most consolation. With the profoundest sentiments of piety and\r\nconfidence in Providence, he passed away June 10th, 1836, at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nWith all his solid piety, this man was not so distant from ordinary\r\nworldly affairs as not to take a lively interest in all that was\r\nhappening around him and, above all, all that concerned the welfare of\r\nmen. He was especially enthusiastic for the freedom of the South\r\nAmerican Republics, eagerly following the course of Bolivar and Canaris,\r\nand rejoicing at the success of their efforts. South American patriots\r\nvisiting Paris found a warm welcome at his hands, and also introductions\r\nthat made life pleasant for them at the French capital. His house was\r\nalways open to them, and no service that he performed for them seemed\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\nAmpère was beloved by his family and his friends; he was perhaps the\r\nbest liked man among his circle of acquaintances in Paris because of the\r\ncharming geniality of his character and his manifold interests. He was\r\nkind, above all, to rising young men in the intellectual world around\r\nhim, and was looked up to by many of them as almost a second father. His\r\ncharity towards the poor was proverbial, and this side of his\r\npersonality and career deserves to be studied quite as much as what he\r\nwas able to accomplish for science. The beauty of his character was\r\nrooted deeply in the religion that he professed, and in our day, when it\r\nhas come to be the custom for so many to think that science and faith\r\nare inalterably opposed, the lesson of this life, so deeply imbued with\r\nboth of these great human interests, deserves to be studied. Ozanam, who\r\nknew him best, has brought out this extremely interesting union of\r\nintellectual qualities, in a passage that serves very well to sum up the\r\nmeaning of Ampère's life.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to his scientific achievements,\" says Ozanam, \"this\r\nbrilliant genius has other claims upon our admiration and affection. He\r\nwas our brother in the faith. It was religion which guided the labors of\r\nhis mind and illuminated his contemplations; he judged all things,\r\nscience itself, by the exalted standard of religion.... This venerable\r\nhead which was crowned by achievements and honors, bowed without reserve\r\nbefore the mysteries of faith, down even below the line which the Church\r\nhas marked for us. He prayed before the same altars before which\r\nDescartes and Pascal had knelt; beside the poor widow and the small\r\nchild who may have been less humble in mind than he was. Nobody observed\r\nthe regulations of the Church more conscientiously, regulations which\r\nare so hard on nature and yet so sweet in the habit. Above all things,\r\nhowever, it is beautiful to see what sublime things Christianity wrought\r\nin his great soul; this admirable simplicity, the unassumingness of a\r\nmind that recognized everything except its own genius; this high\r\nrectitude in matters of science, now so rare, seeking nothing but the\r\ntruth and never rewards and distinction; the pleasant and ungrudging\r\namiability; and lastly, the kindness with which he met everyone,\r\nespecially young people. I can say that those who know only the\r\nintelligence of the man, know only the less perfect part. If he thought\r\nmuch, he loved more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOHM, THE FOUNDER OF MATHEMATICAL ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin, himself one of the greatest of the electrical scientists of\r\nthe nineteenth century, in commenting some years ago on Ohm's law, said\r\nthat it was such an extremely simple expression of a great truth in\r\nelectricity, that its significance is probably not confined to that\r\ndepartment of physical phenomena, but that it is a law of nature in some\r\nmuch broader way. Re-echoing this expression of his colleague, Professor\r\nGeorge Chrystal, of Edinburgh, in his article on electricity in the\r\nEncyclopedia Britannica (IX. edition), says that Ohm's law \"must now be\r\nallowed to rank with the law of gravitation and the elementary laws of\r\nstatical electricity as a _law of nature_ in the strictest sense.\" In a\r\nword, to these leaders and teachers in physical science of the\r\ngeneration after his, though within a comparatively short time after\r\nOhm's death, there has come the complete realization of the absolutely\r\nfundamental character of the discovery made by George Simon Ohm, when he\r\npromulgated the principle that a current of electricity is to be\r\nmeasured by the electromotive force, divided by the resistance in the\r\ncircuit. The very simplicity of this expression is its supreme title to\r\nrepresent a great discovery in natural science. It is the men who reach\r\nsuch absolutely simple formulæ for great fundamental truths that\r\nhumanity has come, and rightly, to consider as representing its greatest\r\nmen in science.\r\n\r\nLike most of the distinguished discoverers in science who have displayed\r\nmarked originality, Ohm came from what is usually called the lower\r\nclasses, his ancestors having had to work for their living for as long\r\nas the history of the family can be traced. His father was a locksmith,\r\nand succeeded his father at the trade. The head of the family for many\r\ngenerations had been engaged at this handicraft. The first of them of\r\nwhom there is any definite record was Ohm's great-grandfather, Wilhelm\r\nOhm, who was a locksmith at Westerholt, not far from Münster, in\r\nWestphalia. Wilhelm Ohm's son, Johann Vincent, the grandfather of the\r\ngreat electrician, during his years as a journeyman locksmith had spent\r\nsome time in France, and subsequently settled down in Kadolzburg, a\r\nsmall suburb of Erlangen, in Bavaria. In 1764, he obtained the position\r\nof locksmith to the University of Erlangen, and became a citizen of that\r\nmunicipality. Both of his sons followed the trade of their father.\r\n\r\nThe elder of these, Johann Wolfgang, worked at his trade as a journeyman\r\nin a number of the small cities of Germany, and only after ten years of\r\nabsence in what, because of the independent condition of the States now\r\nknown as the German Empire, were then considered foreign parts, did he\r\nwander back to his native place. On his return he received the\r\nmastership in his craft, and shortly after, about 1786, married a young\r\nwoman named Beck. George Simon Ohm, the electrical scientist, was the\r\nfirst child of this marriage, and was born March 16th, 1789. A second\r\nson, born three years later, also became distinguished in after-life for\r\nhis mathematical ability. This younger brother, after having filled a\r\nnumber of teaching positions in various German educational institutions,\r\nwas called as professor of mathematics to Berlin, where he died in 1862.\r\n\r\nWhile their father, Johann Wolfgang Ohm, followed his trade of locksmith\r\nfor a living, like many another handicraftsman, he had many mental\r\ninterests which he cultivated in leisure hours, and doubtless dwelt on\r\nwhile his hands were occupied with the mere routine work of his trade.\r\nIt is curiously interesting to find that he devoted himself, during the\r\nhours he could spare from his occupation, to two such diverse\r\nintellectual occupations as mathematics and Kant's philosophy; but they\r\nhad no newspapers in those days, and a man, even of the artisan class,\r\nhad some time for serious mental occupation. It might be thought, under\r\nthese circumstances, that he would be but the most passing of amateurs\r\nin either of these subjects, and have a very superficial knowledge of\r\nthem. This probably was true for his philosophy fad, for there are not\r\nmany who have ever thought themselves more than amateurs in Kantism, and\r\neven Kant himself, I believe, thought that only one scholar ever really\r\nunderstood his system, and subsequently said he had some doubts even\r\nabout that one; but in mathematics, the elder Ohm seems to have attained\r\nnoteworthy success.\r\n\r\nHofrath Langsdorff, who was the professor of mathematics at Erlangen\r\nduring the last decade of the eighteenth century, and who was called to\r\nHeidelberg in 1804, a fact that would seem quite enough to set beyond\r\nall question that his opinion in this matter may be taken as that of a\r\ncompetent judge, declared that the elder Ohm's mathematical knowledge\r\nwas far above the ordinary, and that he knew much more than the elements\r\neven of the higher mathematics. Under these circumstances, it is not\r\nsurprising that the father should have tried to encourage in both his\r\nboys a taste for mathematics, nor that he should have taken their\r\nmathematical instruction into his own hands and succeeded in making\r\nexcellent mathematicians of them, even in their early years. He was so\r\nsuccessful in this, indeed, that Langsdorff, after a five-hour\r\nexamination of the brothers when they were respectively 12 and 15, did\r\nnot hesitate to declare that the Erlangen locksmith's family was likely\r\nto be remembered as containing a pair of brothers who, for success in\r\nmathematics, might rival the famous Bernoulli brothers, so well known at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nThis might be thought only a bit of neighborly praise, meant to warm a\r\nfather's heart, yet it seems indeed to have been given quite seriously.\r\nCertainly the event justified the prophecy. It is not surprising that,\r\nwith such a forecast to encourage him, the father should have been ready\r\nto make every sacrifice to enable both his sons to prepare for the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nHe continued his instruction of them, then, in mathematics, though he\r\ninsisted at the same time that they should continue to keep up their\r\noccupation of locksmiths. In spite of his enthusiasm for mathematics,\r\nthe old gentleman seems to have cherished no illusions with regard to\r\nthe likelihood of pure mathematics ever serving them as a lucrative\r\nmeans of livelihood. It was a very satisfying intellectual interest, but\r\na good trade was much more apt to prove their constant and substantial\r\nstandby, unless, of course, the boys should actually prove to be the\r\ngeniuses foretold. He seems to have realized to the full, Coleridge's\r\nidea that, like the literary man, the mathematician should have some\r\nother occupation, though he might not go to the extent of following\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes' well-known addition to Coleridge's formula, that\r\nhe should, as far as possible, confine himself to the other occupation.\r\nThe boys were given the opportunity to attend the gymnasium of Erlangen,\r\nand seem to have had excellent success in their general studies besides\r\nmathematics.[28]\r\n\r\nIn 1805, when George, the subject of our sketch, was sixteen years of\r\nage, he was graduated from the gymnasium and was ready for the\r\nuniversity. On May 3d, 1805, he took his matriculation examination\r\nbefore the faculty of Erlangen, electing the course of mathematics,\r\nphysics and philosophy. Later in life he told his friends that it was\r\nhis deep love for the mathematics of these studies, and his persuasion\r\nthat in them the student was brought in contact with the most important\r\nfactors for absolute intellectual cultivation, that tempted him to take\r\nthem up. To this he did not hesitate to add that there seemed to him to\r\nbe some call of a higher voice, as if he had a vocation to dedicate\r\nhimself to the cultivation and extension of these important subjects.\r\n\r\nHe had been but some two years at the university, when for a time his\r\nstudies had to be interrupted, partly for lack of means to pursue them,\r\nbut partly because to his father, at least, the university course was\r\nnot the source of such satisfaction as he had anticipated from his son's\r\nability in mathematics. While Ohm took his studies seriously, he was not\r\nby any means a mere \"grind,\" and, indeed, the reputation which he\r\nacquired at the university for many of the qualities which make for a\r\nstudent's popularity among his fellows, was not such as would be likely\r\nto appeal to a very serious-minded father. Ohm had acquired the fame of\r\nbeing one of the best dancers in the university; he was a brilliant\r\nbilliard player and an unrivalled skater; all of which indicates that as\r\na young man he had the physical development and acuteness of sense so\r\nnecessary to enable him to gain prestige in all these sports.\r\n\r\nHis father, in spite of his desire for his son's university career, was\r\nquite willing, then, at the end of September, 1808, to have him take up\r\na position as teacher of mathematics in the school kept by Pastor\r\nZehnder, in the Canton Berne, in Switzerland. His very youthful\r\nappearance (he was only 18 years of age at the time, quite boyish\r\nlooking and not even large for his years) caused the head of this\r\ninstitution no little surprise when he came with letters of introduction\r\nshowing that he was to be the new teacher in mathematics. He could\r\nscarcely believe his eyes for a time. Within a few months, however, he\r\nwas convinced of the ability and the capacity for work of his new\r\naddition to the faculty, who seems to have given, from the very\r\nbeginning, excellent satisfaction in his rather important position.\r\n\r\nOhm remained there some three years and a half and then moved to\r\nNeunberg, where, independent of any educational institution, he set\r\nhimself up as a private tutor in mathematics. His reason for so doing,\r\nas he himself tells, was that he wished to devote himself to the study\r\nof pure mathematics more than was possible in a regular teaching\r\nposition. For this same reason also he refused a number of offers of\r\npositions as teacher of mathematics, which would ordinarily be\r\nconsidered quite flattering to a young man of only 21. Another reason\r\nfor refusing these offers was that he wished to perfect himself in\r\nFrench, and he had an excellent opportunity afforded him for\r\nconversation in this language in the conditions in which he was placed\r\nin Neunberg. This last may seem an unusual reason, but it is\r\ncharacteristic of Ohm's determination always to add to his power of\r\nunderstanding and expression.\r\n\r\nMost young men in Ohm's circumstances are so occupied with the thought\r\nof immediate success in life, that every possible abbreviation of their\r\nstudies which will bring them nearer the opportunity to make their own\r\nliving is likely to be heartily welcomed. Ohm, however, realized that\r\nhis own intellectual development was more important, especially at this\r\ntime, even than getting on in the world; and for this reason his life\r\nhas an added interest, not only for students themselves, but especially\r\nfor those who have the best interests of students at heart and wish to\r\nbe able to cite examples of how a little delay in getting at one's\r\nactual life-work, or, still more, at a remunerative occupation, may\r\nserve the very useful purpose of preparing a man so much the better to\r\nbring out his best intellectual possibilities when he does settle down\r\nto his work.\r\n\r\nAt Easter, 1811, Ohm returned to Erlangen, after having spent nearly two\r\nyears perfecting himself in mathematics. He then finished his studies at\r\nthe university, which seems not to have had the rule of requiring\r\nattendance for a definite period before coming up for its degree, but\r\npermitted him to take the examinations for the doctorate of philosophy\r\non the strength of the work he had done, and gave him his degree on the\r\n25th of October of the same year. With the drawing tighter of the bands\r\nof red tape in educational institutions in more recent years, Ohm would\r\nhave found it difficult to get his degree thus readily, though it was\r\nthe university rather than the graduate who was eventually to be honored\r\nby it. After this, he became _privatdocent_ in mathematics at the\r\nuniversity, and taught for three semesters. He met with marked success\r\nand became very popular with the students. After a year and a half,\r\nhowever, he gave up his university position to accept the professorship\r\nof mathematics at the Realschule of Bamberg.\r\n\r\nWhile Ohm was here, the spirit of young Germany awoke at the news of\r\nNapoleon's unfortunate Moscow campaign, in which his good fortune seemed\r\nto have definitely abandoned the great Emperor of the French. Most of\r\nthe students of the universities of Germany were deeply aroused by it,\r\nand those who know Körner's and Uhland's songs will have some idea of\r\nthe depth of patriotic feeling that was stirred in thousands of young\r\nGerman hearts, who thought that now the opportunity for the fatherland\r\nto throw off the hated foreign yoke forever, had come at last. Ohm\r\ndebated with himself whether he should volunteer with the crowds of\r\nyoung men who were so bravely giving up everything, that the fatherland\r\nmight be free. Two things deterred him. If he went as a soldier, the\r\nmaterial assistance he was able to give his father, and which, as the\r\nold man was now advancing in years and had spent most of his little\r\nsavings upon his sons, was needed, would have to be given up. The other\r\nmotive that kept him at home was, according to his German biographer in\r\nthe Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, which we have been following for\r\nmost of these details, because he felt that what he might be able to\r\naccomplish in other fields besides those of battle would eventually\r\nprove more beneficial for his fatherland, and indeed for the whole of\r\nhumanity, than anything he could do as a soldier, even with the\r\npatriotic motive to help his country to throw off the yoke of the\r\nforeign usurper, which had proven so hard to bear. As we have already\r\nseen, it was a characteristic trait of Ohm all through life, that he\r\ncherished the idea, which acquired almost the force of a premonition,\r\nthat he was destined for great things.\r\n\r\nOhm continued his work as a teacher, then, instead of volunteering for\r\nthe army; but, as might be expected, found the monotonous work of\r\ndrilling young students in mathematics extremely unsatisfactory after a\r\ntime. At the end of a year and a half of service at Bamberg, he asked\r\nfor a change in the conditions of his teaching position. Instead of\r\nthis, he received a transfer to the Bamberg pro-gymnasium, where he was\r\nto teach Latin until a regular teacher was appointed. In spite of his\r\nrepresentations that the teaching position offered him was utterly at\r\nvariance with his talents and his inclinations, he was compelled to\r\naccept this occupation for a time, though after some delay there came\r\nthe assurance that, just as soon as possible, he would be assigned to a\r\nposition as teacher of mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his unfortunate circumstances, which would ordinarily be\r\nthought quite enough to keep him from serious work until he was settled\r\nin a position more suited to his tastes, he devoted himself to the\r\nwriting of his first book during this time, and it was published by\r\nEnke, in Erlangen, in the spring of 1817. Its title was, \"Outlines of\r\nthe Study of Geometry as a Means of Intellectual Culture.\" It comprised\r\nnearly two hundred pages, and gives the best possible insight into the\r\nability and intelligence of the author, then a young man of only\r\ntwenty-eight. As a sort of appendix, he gives a short sketch of his\r\nfather, evidently introduced, not quite so much for the purpose of\r\nfilially confessing his obligations to the old locksmith mathematician,\r\nnor with the idea of repaying some of his immeasurable debt for all the\r\nopportunities which the sacrifices of paternal affection had brought\r\ninto the life of his sons, as to emphasize the excellent educational\r\ninfluence which his father's mathematical training had had upon his\r\nboys, and thus prove his thesis as to the value of mathematical studies\r\nin education. Few filial tributes were ever more deserved or given more\r\nconvincingly or with less suggestion of the conventional attitude of son\r\nto father.\r\n\r\nNow that mathematics has come to occupy probably even a less prominent\r\nplace in education than it did in Ohm's time, though the burden of his\r\ncomplaint with regard to educational methods was that geometry was not\r\nused as a daily developmental subject as much as it should be, it may be\r\ninteresting to recall some of the reasons which he advanced for urging\r\nits greater employment as an instrument for mental training. He thought\r\nthat rational geometry should occupy a place of honor among our means of\r\neducation. Its quality as a mode of pure reasoning, though so closely\r\nrelated to the senses, made easy the transition from sensation to\r\nthought, which is such an important element in education; while its\r\neminently simple character, though combined with definite demands upon\r\nthe constructive faculties, made it appropriate in a high degree for the\r\neducation of the young out of the field of merely imitative use of the\r\nintellect, into that of independent thinking and following out of ideas.\r\n\"Geometry,\" says Ohm, \"when properly taught, not with the fruitless\r\ndrilling usually employed in teaching it, but in such ways as to secure\r\ndeep personal attention, must take rank above all other branches of\r\neducation, in enabling the student to break down the barrier which\r\nseparates mere understanding from personal investigation. It forces a\r\nman whose thoughts were, up to this time, only the repetition of others'\r\nthoughts, to think for himself and to light for himself in his own mind\r\nthe torches which enable him to see things clearly for himself, and not\r\nmerely in the dimness of the half light that is thrown on them by the\r\nexplanations of others.\"\r\n\r\nGeometrical methods always had a special fascination for Ohm, and\r\npractically all of his books and writings bear the impress of that close\r\ndependence of all parts on one another, that absolutely logical\r\nconnection so characteristic of geometric accuracy of thought. His was\r\nthe sort of mind likely to be benefited by mathematical training. Such\r\nminds are, however, comparatively few, for most men are not rational in\r\nany sense of the word, that would make them dependent on logical\r\nreasoning. Perhaps it is as well that they are not, for many of those\r\nlacking in logic or mathematical accuracy of thought and absoluteness of\r\nconclusion, still continue to accomplish much in the world of thought\r\nand do much valuable planning for the complexities of human affairs,\r\nwhere strict logic will not always solve the intricate yet incomplete\r\nproblems that present themselves in human relations, where, indeed,\r\nindividual unknown factors often make any but an approximate solution\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe opinions of the critics as to Ohm's \"Outlines of Geometry\" were, as\r\nmight be easily anticipated, not all flattering, since only a few of the\r\ncritics were able to place themselves on the ideal standpoint of\r\nmathematical subjectivity from which he had written his book. King\r\nFrederick William III., of Prussia, is said to have read it with much\r\ninterest, however, and the royal pleasure doubtless drew attention to\r\nOhm's work, and may have contributed to the fact that, shortly after its\r\npublication, in September, 1817, Ohm was invited by the Royal Consistory\r\nof Cologne to take the position of head professor of mathematics and\r\nphysics in the gymnasium of that city. This post was not only\r\nhonorable, it was also highly remunerative, at least from the\r\nstandpoint of teachers' wages as they were at that time, and Ohm eagerly\r\naccepted the position.\r\n\r\nLamont, who was the director of the Royal Observatory at Munich, has\r\nwritten a memorial of Ohm which contains much valuable information. The\r\nbody of it is an address delivered at a meeting of the Faculty of the\r\nUniversity of Munich in honor of Thaddeus Siber and George Simon Ohm,\r\nbut its value has been much enhanced by notes added before publication.\r\nSiber was a Benedictine who was professor in the philosophical\r\ndepartment at Munich, and died the same year as Ohm. Lamont says that he\r\nreceived his information as to intimate details of Ohm's life from his\r\nbrother, Prof. Martin Ohm, of Berlin. His sketch is, therefore,\r\nabsolutely authoritative. Lamont says with regard to this period of\r\nteaching at Cologne: \"Ohm's first position of importance, in any way\r\nworthy of his talents, was the professorship of mathematics at the large\r\nJesuit gymnasium in Cologne, in 1817, where the special gift that he\r\npossessed, of making the study of mathematics not only comprehensible\r\nbut attractive to boys, brought him success and recognition.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly ten years Ohm had the opportunity to put into practice in\r\nthis Jesuit gymnasium of the Rhineland, the principles which he had so\r\nmuch at heart, for he was apparently given the full freedom of his\r\ndepartment of teaching. He succeeded so well that he received wide and\r\nhearty recognition for his work. The mathematical studies of the Cologne\r\ngymnasium stood higher than had ever been the case before, and this was\r\nall Ohm's work. In the years before his teaching in the Rhenish city,\r\nthose who were distinguished in mathematics at the University of Bonn\r\nhad not come, as a rule, from Cologne, but from other places; but now\r\nnearly all the mathematical prize-takers of Bonn came from among Ohm's\r\nstudents, and the best of the candidates for teaching positions in\r\nphysics and mathematics had also, as a rule, had the advantages of his\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nAmong the best of his scholars at this time was the afterwards\r\nwell-known mathematician, Lejeune-Dirichlet, who taught in Berlin with\r\nJacobi and Steiner and succeeded Gauss in Göttingen. Another of his most\r\ndistinguished pupils was the astronomer Heis, who occupied a modest\r\nposition at the Munster Academy, but whose merits were above the post\r\nwhich he occupied, and who was distinguished for the excellency of his\r\noriginal work and his ability as a mathematician. One very interesting\r\nfact with regard to Ohm's teaching, was that he was successful in\r\ncatching and holding the interest not only of those of his students who\r\nwere later to specialize in mathematics, but also of those who took up\r\nmathematics only as a subject for mental development, that was to be\r\napplied to other purposes later in life, and who found Ohm's teaching of\r\nthe greatest possible service. Among these, the well-known German\r\nliterary man, Jacob Venedey, of Cologne, has expressed his affection and\r\ngratitude for his old teacher in a very striking way in his sketch of\r\nthe cathedral at Cologne, written in the banishment that came to so many\r\nvigorous German thinkers after the failure of the revolution of '48. In\r\nsending a copy of this to Ohm, Venedey says: \"Honored Sir:--It will\r\nperhaps be a source of wonder to you that a student who apparently\r\nlearned so little from you and your colleagues that he must now earn his\r\nbread by writing, should continue to cherish for you the liveliest\r\ngratitude. It is not the fault of mathematics that only the dimmest\r\nrecollection of them remains with me. I shall never forget the\r\npersonality of my professor, however, nor his ways and methods of\r\nteaching. I frequently recount your way with us boys, and I have the\r\nliveliest remembrance of your influence as a teacher. There are seldom\r\nweeks, there never is a month, when I fail to recall you. This is no\r\nmere compliment that I am paying to you, since I know you too well to\r\nthink that flattery would mean anything to you, as it would be unworthy\r\nof you, and I for my part am not one of those who like to bandy\r\ncompliments. I have often wished to meet you again, and a hundred times\r\nI thought that I saw you because some one at a distance had something\r\nthat recalled you. I may say to you that you accomplished something for\r\nme in those days of teaching that I would not have been able to\r\naccomplish for myself. I can only think of you, then, with the highest\r\nfeelings of reverence approaching what might well be called love. It\r\nwill be a happy day, indeed, for me if I am ever in a position to make\r\nan hour of existence happier for you in any way.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Ohm so zealously continued his instruction in both the upper\r\nclasses of the gymnasium, he never lost from sight that higher aim of\r\noriginal research and investigation to which his genius disposed him.\r\n\r\nHis choice of a subject for original investigation wavered for a long\r\ntime between mathematics and physics, but, as he himself declared, his\r\nexperience having shown him that authority was prone to play a large\r\nrole in mathematics, while the field was more open for personal research\r\nand observation in physics, he resolved to take up that department for\r\nhis special studies, consoled by the idea that physics cannot be\r\nproperly pursued without mathematics. Looking around to select a subject\r\nthat would serve as a striking preface to his work in this department,\r\nthough resolved at the same time to avoid one where he would be without\r\nrivalry, he found it all ready to his hand in what one of his\r\ncontemporaries called the enigmatic phenomena of the galvanic current.\r\nThis was to prove a fortunate selection, indeed, both for himself and\r\nthe opportunity afforded his genius as well as for the science of\r\nelectricity itself.\r\n\r\nHe then began a series of investigations, always experimental in\r\ncharacter, and with the mathematical explanations of the phenomena\r\nobserved carefully worked out. Accounts of these studies appeared from\r\ntime to time in the year-book for Chemistry and Physics, issued by\r\nSchweigger. After some ten years, these were collected together, or at\r\nleast the principal portions of them, and published in the second half\r\nof the year-book for the year 1826. The apparatus for his experiments\r\nwas fortunately at command in the gymnasium at Cologne, but without his\r\nmechanical skill, obtained from his experience as a locksmith when a\r\nboy, it would have been impossible so to vary his experiments and modify\r\nhis instruments as to bring out many of the phenomena that he succeeded\r\nin demonstrating. Nearly all of the great discoverers in science have\r\nbeen handy men possessed of mechanical skill, and this is as true for\r\nmedicine, as I have shown in \"Makers of Modern Medicine,\"[27] though it\r\nmight perhaps not be expected, as it is here in electricity, where it\r\nseems very natural.\r\n\r\nOhm felt, in 1826, that he had succeeded in exhausting nearly all that\r\nhe could learn for himself, and as he wished to have opportunities for\r\nfurther study, and especially for further reading, he asked for an\r\nacademic furlough that would carry him over the next year. The work that\r\nhe had already accomplished was beginning to be appreciated, and after\r\ndiscussion of the papers that he had published up to that time, the\r\nrequested furlough was promptly granted; and in a letter in which the\r\nschool authorities praised his school work as well as his original\r\ninvestigations, they allowed him to take the sabbatic year for the\r\nfurtherance of science on one-half the usual salary, though with the\r\ncondition also that more would be allowed to him in case this seemed\r\nnecessary and the conditions justified it.\r\n\r\nThis furlough was perhaps the most important event in Ohm's life. He\r\nemployed it in bringing to a focus the ideas with regard to electricity\r\nwhich had been gradually worked out in his mind during the past ten\r\nyears. In May, 1827, within six months after the beginning of his\r\nexclusive devotion to the subject, Ohm's article on the mathematics of\r\nthe galvanic current appeared. It proved a scientific achievement of the\r\nfirst rank, that was to be epoch-making in the domain of electricity. It\r\nsettled the conditions under which electrical tension exists in various\r\nbodies, and made it clear that there is a fundamental law of electrical\r\nconduction which could be expressed by an easy, simple formula.\r\n\r\nOhm's preface to his little book, that was to work such a revolution in\r\nelectricity and was to remain for all time one of the classics in this\r\ndepartment of science, is typical of the man in many ways. Its modesty\r\ncould not very well be exceeded. Its simplicity constitutes in itself an\r\nappeal to the reader's interest. I know nothing in the literature of the\r\nhistory of science quite like it in these regards, unless it be the\r\npreface of Auenbrugger's little book on percussion, in which he laid the\r\nfoundation of modern clinical diagnosis.[26] The two men have many more\r\nqualities in common than the authorship of modest prefaces to their\r\nbooks. Both of them were geniuses whose names the aftertime will not\r\nwillingly let die, and both of them accomplished their work apart from\r\nthe stream of university life in their time, and met with a like fate in\r\nthe neglect, for some time at least, by their distinguished colleagues\r\nof the important discoveries that they had made. Ohm's preface deserves\r\nto be quoted because of its classic quality:\r\n\r\n\"I herewith present to the public a theory of galvanic electricity as a\r\nspecial part of electrical science in general, and shall successively,\r\nas time, inclination and means permit, arrange more such portions\r\ntogether into a whole, if this first essay shall in some degree repay\r\nthe sacrifice it has cost me. The circumstances in which I have hitherto\r\nbeen placed have not been suitable either to encourage me in the pursuit\r\nof novelties or to enable me to become acquainted with works relating to\r\nthe same department of literature throughout its whole extent. I have,\r\ntherefore, chosen for my first attempt a department of science in which\r\nI have the least to apprehend competition.\r\n\r\n\"May the well-disposed reader accept whatever I have accomplished with\r\nthe same love for science as that with which it is sent forth!--The\r\nAuthor, Berlin, May 1st, 1827.\"\r\n\r\nIn his preface to the American edition of the \"Galvanic Circuit\r\nInvestigated Mathematically,\"[25] Mr. Thomas D. Lockwood, vice-president\r\nof the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, said of this\r\nmasterpiece of Ohm's: \"A sufficient reason for republishing an English\r\ntranslation of the wonderful book of Professor G. S. Ohm is the\r\ndifficulty with which the only previous translation (that of Taylor's\r\nScientific Memoirs) is procurable.\r\n\r\n\"Besides this, however, the intrinsic value of the book is so great that\r\nit should be read by all electricians who care for more than superficial\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"It is most remarkable to note, at this time, how completely Ohm stated\r\nhis famous law that the electromotive force divided by the resistance is\r\nequal to the strength of the current.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the book as a whole, Mr. Lockwood says, after suggesting\r\ncertain anticipations of Ohm's ideas which had been made in the\r\npreceding century: \"Ohm's work stands alone, and, reading it at the\r\npresent time, one is filled with wonder at the prescience, respect for\r\nhis patience and prophetic soul, and admiration of the immensity and\r\nvariety of ground covered by his little book, which is indeed his best\r\nmonument.\"\r\n\r\nLike many another great discovery in physical science, Ohm's work\r\nfailed to receive the immediate appreciation which it deserved. It\r\ncannot be said, however, that it failed to attract attention. It would\r\nbe easier, indeed, to forgive the scientists of the day if this were\r\ntrue. Not long after its appearance, abstracts from it were made by\r\nFechner in Leipzig, by Pfaff in Erlangen, and Poggendorff in Berlin,\r\nwhich showed that these scientists understood very clearly the\r\nsignificance and comprehended the wide application of Ohm's law as\r\nclaimed by its author. From these men there was no question of hostile\r\ncriticism. Professor Pohl, of the University of Berlin, however, in the\r\nBerlin \"Year-book of Scientific Criticism,\" did not hesitate to express\r\nhis utter disagreement, and declared that Ohm's work was fallacious and\r\nshould be rejected. Other writers of the time treated Ohm's article more\r\nor less indifferently, as a merely conventional contribution to science.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pohl's opinion was taken to represent the conclusions of the\r\nfaculty of the University of Berlin, especially noted for mathematical\r\nability. This was to prove a serious hindrance to Ohm in the university\r\ncareer which he had planned for himself. At Berlin they had the ear of\r\nthe Minister of Education, and it was not long before Ohm felt that the\r\ncriticisms of his work were making themselves felt in a direction\r\nunfavorable to him. Not long after the appearance of his book, there\r\ncame a disagreement between Ohm and the educational authorities. Ohm\r\nfelt that this was due to failure to recognize the significance of his\r\nwork, and that under the circumstances he could not hope for the\r\nappreciation that would provide him with the opportunities he deserved.\r\nHe insisted on sending in his resignation as a teacher. Nothing could\r\nchange his determination in the matter, not even the pleas of his former\r\nscholars, and his resignation had to be accepted.\r\n\r\nOhm had hoped for a teaching position in a university. The Minister of\r\nEducation declared that, while his work as a teacher had been\r\naccomplished with careful industry and diligence and conscientious\r\nattention to duty, the ministry regretted that, in spite of thorough\r\nappreciation of him and admiration for his excellent work as a\r\nscientist, they could not find for him a position outside of the\r\ngymnasium. How utterly trivial the conventional expressions sound, now\r\nthat we know that they brought about for the time being the interruption\r\nof one of the most brilliant scientific careers in Europe. Of course,\r\nthe geese cannot be expected to appreciate the swans, and it was not the\r\nminister's fault, but that of some of Ohm's own colleagues. The next six\r\nyears of his life, the precious years between 38 and 44, Ohm had to give\r\nup the idea of teaching in a university, and devote himself to some\r\nprivate tutoring in Berlin, with a stipend of about three hundred\r\ndollars a year, miserable enough, yet sufficient, as would appear, for\r\nOhm's simple mode of life. This he owed to the kindness of Gen.\r\nRadowitz, who employed him to teach mathematics in a military school in\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this time, when he was nearly 45 years of age, his\r\nunfortunate situation attracted the attention of King Ludwig I., of\r\nBavaria, who offered him the chair of professor of physics at the\r\nPolytechnic School in Nuremberg, which had recently by royal rescript\r\nbeen raised to the status of a Royal Institute, with the same rank in\r\neducational circles as a lyceum for the study of humanities. Here Ohm's\r\nduties were shortly to be multiplied. He became the inspector of\r\nscientific instruction, after having occupied for some time the\r\nprofessorship of mathematics, and later became the rector of the\r\nPolytechnic School, a position which he held for some ten years,\r\nfulfilling its duties with the greatest conscientiousness and fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\nOhm continued his work at Nuremberg for more than fifteen years. During\r\nthis time, he succeeded in making his mark in every one of the\r\ndepartments of physics. He is usually considered as owing his reputation\r\nas an experimental and mathematical scientist to his researches in\r\nelectricity. As a matter of fact, every branch of physics was\r\nilluminated by his work, and perhaps nothing shows the original genius\r\nof the man better than the fact that everything which he took up\r\nrevealed new scientific aspects in his hands. The only wonder is that he\r\nshould have remained so long in a subordinate position in the\r\neducational world at Nuremberg, and received his appointment as\r\nuniversity professor of physics at Munich only in 1849.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the administrative educational work that came to him at\r\nNuremberg, Ohm did not neglect original investigation, but somehow\r\nsucceeded in finding time for experiment and study. Having made a\r\ncardinal discovery in electricity, of the value of which surely no one\r\nwas more aware than himself, Ohm might have been expected, as soon as\r\nhis new post gave him the opportunity, to devote himself quite\r\nexclusively to this department of science. Instead, he turned for a time\r\nto the related subjects of sound, heat and light, devoting himself\r\nespecially to their mathematics. He did this, as he said himself, to\r\ncomplete for his own satisfaction his knowledge of the scientific\r\nfoundations of the imponderables, as heat, light and electricity were\r\nthen called, but also because he wished, for the sake of his students,\r\nto get closely in touch with what had been accomplished by recent\r\ninvestigators in physics.\r\n\r\nIt is almost a universal rule in science, that no matter how\r\ndistinguished an investigator may be, he makes but one cardinal\r\ndiscovery. Ohm, however, was destined, after having brilliantly\r\nilluminated electricity by the discovery of a great law, to throw nearly\r\nas bright a light on the domain of acoustics; and there is a law in this\r\ndepartment of physics which is deservedly called by his name, though it\r\nis often associated with that of Helmholtz. Helmholtz himself was always\r\nmost emphatic in his insistence on Ohm's priority in the matter, and\r\nconstantly speaks of the law in question by Ohm's name.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no better evidence of the breadth of Ohm's interest in science,\r\nhis supreme faculty for experimentation, or the originality of his\r\ninvestigating genius, can be found than the fact that he thus\r\ndiscovered, by experimental and mathematical methods, the solution to\r\nimportant problems in two such distinct departments of physical science\r\nas electricity and acoustics. Before his time, the question of\r\nelectrical resistance was absolutely insoluble. The problem in acoustics\r\nwas not less obscure, as may be judged from the fact that, though some\r\nof the best physicists and mathematicians of Europe during the\r\neighteenth century--and there were giants in those days, among others,\r\nBrook Taylor in England, D'Alembert in France, Johann Bernoulli and\r\nEuler in Germany, and finally, Daniel Bernoulli--had devoted themselves\r\nto its solution, it remained nevertheless unsolved. Here, as in\r\nelectricity, the simplicity of the solution which Ohm found shows how\r\ndirect were his methods of thinking and how thorough his modes of\r\ninvestigation. Perhaps the most striking feature of Ohm's work in\r\nacoustics, and, above all, his solution of an important problem in\r\nmusic, is the fact that he himself, unlike most of his German\r\ncompatriots, had no ear for music and no liking for it.\r\n\r\nIn his address delivered at the public meeting of the Royal Bavarian\r\nAcademy of Sciences at Munich, in March, 1889, the hundredth anniversary\r\nof the birth of Ohm, Eugene Lommel, in discussing the scientific work of\r\nOhm, said: \"Inasmuch as his law in acoustics furnished the clearest\r\ninsight into the hitherto incomprehensible nature of musical tones, it\r\ndominates the acoustics of to-day no less completely than Ohm's law of\r\nthe electric current dominates the science of electricity.\"[24] This law\r\nconcerns the resolution of tones into their constituents. The ideas laid\r\ndown by Ohm were almost absolutely novel. They were so new that none of\r\nthe workers in acoustics could think that Ohm had made a great\r\ndiscovery. His law states that the human ear perceives only\r\npendulum-like vibration as a simple tone. Every other periodic motion it\r\nresolves into a collection of pendulum-like vibrations, which it then\r\nhears in the sound as a series of single tones, fundamentals and\r\novertones. Ohm arrived at this law from mathematical considerations,\r\nmaking use of Fourier's series; for its experimental verification he was\r\ncompelled to use the well-cultivated ear of a friend, inasmuch as he was\r\nhimself, as we have said, quite devoid of musical appreciation.\r\n\r\nOhm's results were too distant from the accustomed ideas of\r\ninvestigators of sound at that time to be accepted by them. Seebeck, who\r\nwas one of the most prominent scientists of the time in acoustics, did\r\nnot hesitate to criticise severely, just as Pohl had made little of\r\nOhm's law of the electric current. While, however, foreigners were to\r\nteach German scientists the value of the advance that their great\r\ncolleague in electricity had made, the privilege of pointing out the\r\nsignificance of his work in sound was to be a compatriot's good fortune.\r\nIt was nearly a score of years, however, before this vindication was to\r\ntake place. Then Helmholtz, a decade after Ohm's death, furnished the\r\nexperimental means which enabled even the unskilled ear to resolve a\r\nsound into its simple partial tones, and revolutionized the theory of\r\nmusic by his classic work, \"The Science of the Perception of Sound,\"\r\nwhich is based entirely on Ohm's law of acoustics.\r\n\r\nOhm, in the appendix to his work, \"The Galvanic Circuit treated\r\nmathematically,\" dared to suggest certain speculations with regard to\r\nthe ultimate structure of matter. He said: \"There are properties of\r\nspace-filling matter which we are accustomed to look upon as belonging\r\nto it. There are other properties which heretofore we have been inclined\r\nto look upon as accidents or guests of matter, which abide with it from\r\ntime to time. For these properties man has thought out causes, if not\r\nforeign, at least extrinsic, and they pass as immaterial independent\r\nphases of nature under the names light, heat, electricity, etc. It must\r\nbe possible so to conceive the structure of physical bodies that, along\r\nwith the properties of the first class, at the same time and necessarily\r\nthose of the second shall be given.\"\r\n\r\nIt is all the more interesting to come upon Ohm's speculations on this\r\nsubject of the ultimate constitution of matter, because within a few\r\nyears of his time, Pasteur, then only a comparatively young man, had\r\nalso been taken with the idea of getting at the constitution of matter\r\nby his observations upon dissymmetry, which he abandoned after a time,\r\nhowever, because he found other and more practical subjects to devote\r\nhimself to, though he never gave up the thought that he might some time\r\nreturn to them and perhaps discover the underlying principles of matter\r\nfrom observations in this subject. It was not until the last five years\r\nof his life, when Ohm was already past sixty, that he was to enjoy the\r\nsatisfaction of an ambition which he had cherished from his earliest\r\nyears as a teacher, and which, in spite of untoward circumstances, had\r\nbeen a precious stimulus in his work. For some twenty years he had hoped\r\nsome time to be able to devote himself to the investigation of the\r\nphysical constitution of matter. Unfortunately, when the opportunity\r\ncame, the manifold duties of his teaching position prevented the\r\ncompletion of his great work, and doubtless robbed his generation and\r\nours of a precious heritage in the mathematics of the structure of\r\nmatter, which would doubtless have been of the greatest possible value.\r\n\r\nIt is of course idle to speculate as to what he might have accomplished\r\nif left to his original investigation. The problem which he now took up\r\nwas much more difficult than any of his preceding tasks. It would have\r\nseemed, however, quite as hopeless to those who lived before Ohm's laws,\r\nto look for a single complete law of the resistance of the electrical\r\ncurrent in the circuit or of the overtones in music, as it is to us to\r\nthink of a simple mathematical formula for atomic relations. What Ohm\r\naccomplished in these other cases by his wonderful power of eliminating\r\nall the unnecessary factors in the problem, would surely have helped him\r\nhere. The main power of genius, after all, is its faculty of\r\neliminating the superfluous, which always obscures the real question at\r\nissue to such a degree for ordinary minds, that they are utterly unable\r\nto see even the possibility of a simple solution of it. Art has been\r\ndefined as the elimination of the superfluous; discovery in science\r\nmight well be defined in the same terms. Under the circumstances, we\r\ncannot help regretting that Ohm was not allowed the time and the\r\nopportunity to work out the thoughts with which he was engaged. It would\r\nhave been even more satisfactory if the precious years of his ripe\r\nmiddle age had not been wasted in trivial, conventional tasks, so that\r\nhe might have been permitted to devote his academic leisure, sooner than\r\nwas actually the case, to the problem which had been so constantly in\r\nmind since he made his great generalization in the laws of electricity.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of Ohm's time had now to be taken up with his\r\nteaching duties. Only for his self-sacrifice in the matter, his success\r\nas a teacher would doubtless have been less marked. Science itself must\r\nhave suffered, however, from this pre-occupation of mind with a round of\r\nconventional duties, since Ohm could no longer devote his time to\r\noriginal research. In the meantime, his great discovery was coming to\r\nits own. During these ten years since the publication of his book, a\r\nnumber of distinguished physicists in every country--Poggendorff, and\r\nespecially Fechner, in Germany, Jacobi and Lenz in Russia, Henry in\r\nAmerica, Rosenkoeld in Sweden, and De Heer in Holland--took up the\r\nproblems of the current strength of electricity as set forth in Ohm's\r\nlaw, and confirmed his conclusion by their investigations along similar\r\nlines. The French physicist and member of the Academy of Sciences,\r\nPouillet, applied Ohm's ideas to thermo-electricity and\r\npyro-electricity, employing his terms and bringing his work to the\r\nnotice of foreigners generally, so that a translation of Ohm's work was\r\nmade into English.\r\n\r\nOhm's work at once attracted the attention that it deserved in England.\r\nThe Royal Society conferred on him the Copley Medal, which had been\r\nfounded as a reward for important discoveries in the domain of natural\r\nknowledge. Before Ohm's time only one other German scientist, Carl\r\nFriedrich Gauss, of Göttingen, had ever been thus honored. The words\r\nemployed by the Royal Society in conferring this distinction showed how\r\nthoroughly the representatives of English science appreciated Ohm's\r\nwork. They said that he had set forth the laws of the electric current\r\nvery clearly, and thus accomplished the solution of a problem which was\r\nas important in the realm of applied science as it had hitherto been in\r\nthe schools. Recognition now became the rule, and Ohm had the\r\nsatisfaction of having all his colleagues in the physical sciences\r\nacknowledge the significance of his work.\r\n\r\nOhm's recognition, then, came from foreigners first, and only afterwards\r\nfrom his fellow-countrymen. Immediate appreciation might have meant much\r\nfor him, and even this tardy recognition gave him renewed courage and\r\nnew strength to go on with his work. He gave effective expression at\r\nonce to his gratitude and to the stimulus that had been afforded him by\r\nthe dedication to the Royal Society of London of the great work,\r\n\"Contributions to molecular Physics,\" which he planned.\r\n\r\nThe year after he received the Copley Medal, he was made a Foreign\r\nAssociate of the Royal Society of England, and from this time on his\r\ndiscoveries began to find their way into text-books as fundamental\r\ndoctrines in the science of electricity. German and foreign scientific\r\nbodies followed the English example so happily set for them, and began\r\nto give him their recognition as a physicist of the first rank. Ohm's\r\nfurther observations were, for a time, not accepted so readily as his\r\nfirst law. The reason for this was that Ohm was so far ahead of his\r\ntimes that there was not as yet in existence a suitable electroscope to\r\ntest their truth. Finally, the invention of an exact electrometer by\r\nDellman, and its application by Professor Kohlrausch, of Marburg, made\r\nthe experimental confirmation of all his work quite as significant as\r\nfor his law.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking reflection on Ohm's career, though not very encouraging\r\nfor the discoverer in science, to realize that some important\r\ndiscoveries, which thus proved eventually quite as epoch-making as his\r\nlaw, had lain for practically ten years neglected, and their\r\nmagnificently endowed author had been allowed to eke out a rather\r\ndifficult existence in teaching, not in the important department of\r\nscience in which he was so great a master, but in certain conventional\r\nphases of mathematics which might very well have been taught by almost\r\nanyone who knew the elements of higher mathematics. Ohm's case is not a\r\nsolitary phenomenon in the history of science, however, but rather\r\nfollows the rule, that a genuine novelty is seldom welcomed by the\r\nleaders of science at any given moment; but, on the contrary, rather\r\ndecried, and its discoverer always frigidly put in his proper place by\r\nthose who resent his audacity in presuming to teach _them_ something\r\nnew in their _own_ science.\r\n\r\nHaving thus illuminated electricity and acoustics, Ohm turned his\r\nattention to the department of optics. His power to simplify\r\ndifficulties and get at the heart of obscure problems is illustrated by\r\nhis contribution to this subject, made while he was professor of physics\r\nin the University of Munich. Optics had early engaged his attention, and\r\nin 1840 he published a paper in Poggendorff's Annalen, bearing the\r\ntitle, \"A Description of some simple and easily managed Arrangements for\r\nmaking the Experiment of the Interference of Light.\" With his usual\r\nfaculty for simplifying things, he showed that the interference prisms\r\nwhich were made so carefully by the French could be constructed from\r\ncommon plate-glass. He was indeed able to demonstrate that a simple\r\nstrip from the edge of a piece of such glass could be used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nHe pursued this absorbing subject until 1852-53, and then set himself\r\nthe difficult task of developing a general theory of these phenomena of\r\ninterference which are so rich in form and color. The problem was indeed\r\nalluring, but some of the best minds in nineteenth century science in\r\nEurope had been engaged at it, without bringing much order out of the\r\nchaos, and it would have looked quite unpromising to anyone but Ohm, to\r\nwhom, the greater the difficulty of a subject, the more the attraction\r\nit possessed. With his wonderful power of synthesis and his capacity to\r\ndiscover a clue to the way through a maze of difficulties, Ohm succeeded\r\nin finding a formula of great simplicity and beauty and which covered\r\nall the individual colors. It was only after he had reached his\r\nconclusions and was actually publishing his results, that the German\r\nscientist found that he had been anticipated by Professor Langberg, of\r\nChristiania, in Norway, with regard to the principal points of his\r\ninvestigation, though not as to all its details. Professor Langberg[23]\r\nhad published his article in the Norwegian Magazine for Natural Sciences\r\nin 1841, and an abstract of it had appeared the following year in the\r\nfirst complementary volume (Erganzungsband) of Poggendorff's Annalen.\r\n\r\nOf this publication by Professor Langberg, Ohm had known absolutely\r\nnothing. He had even gone to some pains to find out, before undertaking\r\nhis own investigation, whether anything had been published on the\r\nmatter. At the sessions of the German Naturalists' Association, held in\r\n1852, he had called the attention of many prominent physicists and\r\nmineralogists who were present at that meeting to the colored concentric\r\nellipses which occur in connection with certain crystals used in the\r\ninvestigation of polarization. He asked whether these had ever been seen\r\nbefore, or whether anything had been written about them. All of those\r\nwhom he consulted declared that they had not observed them, and that, so\r\nfar as they knew, nothing had been published with regard to them.\r\nAccordingly, Ohm proceeded with his work, only to find, after its formal\r\npublication, that he had been almost entirely anticipated and that the\r\nmerit of original discovery belonged to his Norwegian colleague.\r\n\r\nWhen his attention was called to the publication, Ohm was perfectly\r\nready to acknowledge the priority of Professor Langberg's claim and to\r\ngive him all the credit that belonged to his discovery. At the beginning\r\nof the second part of his article, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I know not whether I should consider it lucky or unlucky that the\r\nextremely meritorious work of Langberg should have entirely escaped me\r\nand should have been lost to general recollection. Certain it is that,\r\nif I had had any knowledge of it before, my present investigations,\r\nwhich were occasioned by this elliptical system, would not have been\r\nmade and I would have been spared a deal of work. In that case, however,\r\na number of other and scarcely less important scientific principles\r\nwould have remained hidden for the time being at least. Under the\r\ncircumstances, the profound truth of the old proverb, 'Man proposes, but\r\nGod disposes,' has been brought home to me again. What originally set me\r\ninvestigating this subject now proves to be without interest for\r\nscience, since the problem has been solved before. On the other hand, a\r\nnumber of things of which I had no hint at all at the beginning of my\r\nresearches, have come to take its place and compensate for it.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing will show better than this, Ohm's disposition toward\r\nthat Providence which overrules everything, and somehow, out of the\r\nmixture of good and evil in life, accomplishes things that make for the\r\ngreat purpose of creation. His eminently inquiring attitude towards\r\nscience, which had on three occasions led him to tackle problems that\r\nhad puzzled the greatest of experimental scientists, has been shown. He\r\nmust have been, above all things, a man of a scientific turn of mind, in\r\nthe sense that he was not ready to accept what had previously been\r\naccepted even by distinguished authorities in science, but was ready to\r\nlook for new clews that would lead him to simpler explanations than any\r\nthat had been offered before. In spite of this inquiring disposition, so\r\neminently appropriate to the scientist, and constituting the basis of\r\nhis success as an experimenter and scientific synthesist, he seems to\r\nhave no doubts about the old explanation of the creation nor the\r\nall-wise directing power of a Divine Providence. This is all the more\r\ninteresting, because already the materialistic view of things, which\r\nclaims to know nothing except what can be learned from the matter around\r\nus, had begun to make its way in Europe, especially in scientific\r\ncircles, but Ohm remained untouched by it.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this same state of mind in Ohm is to be found in the\r\npreface to his last great work, his contribution to molecular physics,\r\nin which he hoped to sum up all that he could discover and demonstrate\r\nmathematically with regard to the constitution of matter. He knew that\r\nhe was taking up a work that would require many years and much laborious\r\noccupation of mind. He realized, too, that his duties as professor of\r\nphysics and mathematics as well as the directorship of the museum and\r\nthe consultancy to the department of telegraphs, left him comparatively\r\nlittle time for the work. He foresaw that he might not be able to finish\r\nit, yet hoped against hope that he would. In the preface to the first\r\nvolume, he declared that he would devote himself to it at every possible\r\nopportunity, and that he hoped that _God would spare him to complete\r\nit_. This simplicity of confidence in the Almighty is indeed a striking\r\ncharacteristic of the man.\r\n\r\nThe work which Ohm began thus with such humble trust in God, was to\r\ncontain his conclusions concerning the nature, size, form and mode of\r\naction of the atom, with the idea of being able to deduce, by the aid of\r\nanalytical mechanics, all the phenomena of matter. Unfortunately, he was\r\nspared only to write the first, an introductory volume which bears the\r\ntitle, \"Elements of the analytical geometry of space on a system of\r\noblique co-ordinates.\" This did not touch, as he confesses, the ultimate\r\nproblem he had in mind. The second volume was to have contained the\r\ndynamics of the structures of bodies, and a third and fourth were to be\r\ndevoted to the physical investigation of the atom and its relation to\r\nother atoms and matter in general.\r\n\r\nOhm devoted himself, however, with too much ardor to his duties as\r\nteacher, to allow himself to give the time to his own work that would\r\nhave enabled him to finish it. Among other things that he did for his\r\nstudents was to complete a text-book of physics. He confesses that he\r\nhad always felt an aversion to working at a text-book, and yet was\r\nimpelled to take up the task because he felt that in electricity, in\r\nsound and in optics, the only way in which his students would get his\r\nideas, many of which were the result of his own work, was to have a\r\ntext-book by himself, and he felt bound in duty to do this for them, as\r\nhe had accepted the position of instructor. He succeeded in completing\r\nthe book very rapidly by lithographing his lectures immediately after\r\ndelivery and distributing copies to his classes.\r\n\r\nIt is almost needless to say that the work was, in its way, thoroughly\r\noriginal. It was accomplished with the ease with which he was always\r\nable to do things; but, unfortunately, the strain of the work told on\r\nhim at his years much more than when, as a younger man, he was able to\r\nwork without fatigue. He acknowledges, at the close of the preface, that\r\nthe task has been too great, and that he should not have undertaken its\r\naccomplishment, and especially not in the hasty way in which it was\r\ndone. This preface was dated Easter, 1854. Within a few months, Ohm's\r\nstrength began to fail, and the end was not long in coming.\r\n\r\nAccording to the translation of the address of Lommel, as it appeared in\r\nthe Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institute for 1851, Ohm died as the\r\nresult of repeated attacks of epilepsy, on July 6th, 1854. The date is\r\ncorrect; the mode of death, however, is surely reported under a\r\nmisunderstanding. The physician who hears of epilepsy is prone at once\r\nto inquire as to its origin, and to wonder how long the patient had been\r\nsuffering from it. There are no reports of previous attacks of epilepsy,\r\nand the sudden development of genuine epilepsy in fatal form at the age\r\nof 65 is quite unlikely.\r\n\r\nHis German biographer, Bauernfeind, who is quoted by Lommel as one of\r\nthe authorities for the details of Ohm's life, and who was a pupil and\r\nintimate friend, gives quite a different account. Up to the very last\r\nday of his life, Ohm continued his lectures. His duties as professor\r\nappealed to his conscience as no others. On Thursday, July 6th, 1854, he\r\ndelivered his last lecture. That night at ten o'clock he died. The cause\r\nof his death was given as a repeated apopleptic stroke. It is evidently\r\nbecause of the occurrence of more apopleptic seizures than one, that the\r\nassertion of epilepsy was introduced unto the account of his death.\r\n\r\nFor some days before his death, Ohm had been very weak, but had\r\ncontinued to fulfil every duty. To us in the modern time, it may seem\r\nsurprising that there should be lectures in a university in July; but\r\nthe second semester of the university year in Germany is not supposed to\r\ncome to a close until the first of August, when the summer vacation\r\nbegins, and lectures are continued until well on into July. The manner\r\nof Ohm's death, as told by his biographer friend, at once corrects the\r\nidea of epilepsy, and also shows that his passing came without any of\r\nthe preliminary suffering that makes death a real misfortune. A half\r\nhour before his death, he had been entertaining some friends with lively\r\nrecollections of the events of his early life in Cologne and Treves. He\r\nhad been quite gay in the stories that he told, and almost boyishly\r\nhappy in the recollections of those early days. For one for whom duty\r\nhad meant so much in life, and who had always tried so faithfully to\r\nfulfil it, no happier call to higher things could possibly be imagined\r\nthan that which came to Ohm.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday he was followed to the grave by numbers of\r\nfriends, by all his colleagues and by most of the students of the Munich\r\nUniversity. The university felt that it had suffered a great loss, and\r\nno signs of its grief were felt to be too much. Ohm was buried in the\r\nold Munich graveyard, where his bones still rest, beneath the simple\r\nmemorial not unworthy of the modest scientist who did his work patiently\r\nand quietly, yet with never-failing persistency; who cared not for the\r\napplause of the multitude, and accomplished so much quite independently\r\nof any of the ordinary helps from others and from great educational\r\ninstitutions that are often supposed to be almost indispensably\r\nnecessary for the accomplishment of original scientific work.\r\n\r\nOhm's personal appearance will be of interest to many of those to whom\r\nhis discoveries have made him appeal as one of the great original\r\nthinkers in modern science. He was almost small in stature, even below\r\nmiddle height; and those who remember Virchow, may get something of an\r\nidea of his appearance when told that those who saw Ohm and knew\r\nVirchow, considered that there was a certain reminder of each other in\r\nthe two men. According to his intimate friend and biographer, he had a\r\nvery expressive face, with a high, somewhat doubled forehead. His eyes\r\nwere deep and full of intelligence. His mouth, very sharply defined,\r\nbetrayed, at the first glance, at once the earnest thinker and the\r\npleasant man of friendly disposition. He was always restful and never\r\nseemed to be distracted. He talked but little, but his conversation was\r\nalways interesting, and, except when he was in some particularly serious\r\nmood, was always likely to have a vein of light humor in it. He did not\r\nhesitate to introduce a sparkle of wit now and then into his lectures,\r\nand especially knew how gently to make fun of mistakes made by his\r\npupils, yet in such a way as not to hurt their feelings, but to make\r\nthem realize the necessity for more careful thought before giving\r\nanswers, and for appreciating principles before speculating on them. He\r\nwas particularly careful not to do anything that would offend his\r\nstudents in any way, and it is to this care that the success of his\r\nmethod of teaching has been especially attributed.\r\n\r\nHis habits of life were from the beginning of his career simple, and\r\nthey continued to be so until the end. He was never married, and he\r\nhimself attributed this to the unfavorable condition of his material\r\nresources at the beginning of his career as a teacher, and the fact that\r\nthe improvement in these did not really come until he was well past\r\nfifty years of age. He once confessed to a friend that he missed those\r\nmodest pleasures of family life which do so much to give courage and\r\nstrength for the greater as well as the lesser sufferings of life. Most\r\nof his years of teaching he spent in boarding houses. Only after his\r\nappointment to the professorship at Munich was he able to have a\r\ndwelling for himself, which was presided over by a near relative.\r\n\r\nOhm is remembered as a teacher rather than as an educational\r\nadministrator. His pupils recall him as one who was able to be eminently\r\nsuggestive, while at the same time he succeeded in making it easy to\r\nacquire the details of information. The didactic lecture, as a method of\r\nteaching, did not appeal to him, and his success was due to the\r\napplication of quite other methods. He realized how much personal\r\ninfluence meant, and the peculiarity of his system of teaching was an\r\nalmost uninterrupted lively personal intercourse with his pupils.\r\nDemonstrations and exercises at the board always occupied the first half\r\nof his two-hour lesson, and only the other half was devoted to the\r\nsetting forth of new matter. In this way, Ohm succeeded not only in\r\ninfluencing each student according to his personal endowments, but he\r\nalso began the training of future teachers by giving them a living\r\nexample of what their work should be.\r\n\r\nThe success of Ohm as a teacher was recognized on all sides. His\r\nattitude towards his scholars was very different from that which was\r\nassumed by many teachers. Instead of being a mere conveyer of scientific\r\ninformation, he was himself \"a high priest of science,\" as one of his\r\npupils declared, supplying precious inspiration, and not merely pointing\r\nout the limits of lessons and finding out whether they were known, but\r\nmaking work productively interesting, while neglecting none of the\r\ndetails. His pupils became distinguished engineers, and as this is the\r\nperiod in which the state railroads were being built, there was plenty\r\nof opportunity for them to apply the instruction they had received. Not\r\nonly were the reports of the Royal Commission of Inspection repeated\r\nevidence of Ohm's success as a teacher, but the technical schools which\r\nwere under the care of Ohm's disciples soon came to be recognized as far\r\nabove the average, and as representing not only the successful teaching\r\nof technics on his part, but also the influence that his example as a\r\nteacher had in forming others to carry on the work.\r\n\r\nHow much Ohm was beloved by those who knew him best can be properly\r\nappreciated from the following passage from the panegyric delivered in\r\nMunich in 1855, not long after his death, by Professor Lamont, who had\r\nknown him intimately: \"Nature,\" he said, \"conferred upon Ohm goodness of\r\nheart and unselfishness to an unusual degree. These precious qualities\r\nformed the groundwork of all his intercourse with his fellows. Despite\r\nthe underlying strength of his character, which kept him faithfully at\r\nwork during all his career, whenever there was question of merely\r\npersonal advantage to himself, he preferred to yield to pressure from\r\nwithout, rather than rouse himself to resistance, and he thus avoided\r\nall bitterness in life. The unfortunate events which forced him, during\r\nthe early part of his career, from an advantageous position back into\r\nprivate life, did not produce any misanthropic feelings in him, and when\r\nlater a brilliant recognition gave him that rank in the world of science\r\nwhich by right belonged to him, his simplicity of conduct was not in\r\nany way modified, nor was the modesty of his disposition at all\r\naltered.\" In a word, Ohm was one of those rare geniuses whose\r\nmagnanimity placed him above the vicissitudes of fortune. His power to\r\ndo original work was not disturbed by the opposition which a really new\r\ndiscoverer invariably meets, but his unfailing equanimity was just as\r\nlittle exalted into conceit and pretentiousness by the praise which so\r\njustly came to him once the real significance of his scientific work\r\ndawned upon the world.\r\n\r\nWith the realization of all that Ohm's Work meant in the department of\r\nelectricity, it is easy to understand how his name deserves a place in\r\nthe science for all time. In order permanently to honor his memory, the\r\nInternational Congress of Electricians, which met at Paris in 1881,\r\nconfirmed the action of the British Association of 1861, by giving the\r\nname _ohm_ to the unit of electrical resistance. This is an ideal\r\nmonument to the great worker. It is as simple and modest a reward as\r\neven he would have wished, expressing as it does, the gratitude of\r\nsucceeding generations of scientists for all time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] Ohm's brother, Martin Ohm, deserves a passing word,\r\nbecause his life is characteristically different in certain ways and\r\nbecause, above all, it represents academic success, while Ohm's was\r\nalmost an academic failure. He finally received the professorship in\r\nmathematics at Berlin, and came to be considered as one of the greatest\r\nprofessors of the subject in Europe. Their careers form typical examples\r\nof the fact, often notable in history, that talent finds a ready welcome\r\nin the academic world, while genius is often neglected, and indeed may\r\nbe, and often is, the target for bitter opposition. The younger Ohm's\r\nwritings are mainly with regard to mathematics, but nearly always from\r\nsome general rather than special standpoint, and very often with regard\r\nto the educational side of the subject. His first book was on Analytic\r\nand Higher Geometry in their Elements. He then wrote class text-books of\r\nmathematics and mechanics. One of his works, The Spirit of Mathematical\r\nAnalysis and its Relation to a Logical System, because of its value as\r\nan educational document attracted widespread attention. This book,\r\ntranslated by Ellis into English, was published in London in 1845. One\r\nof Martin Ohm's earlier books should be of special interest to educators\r\nbecause of its subject. Its rather lengthy title is, \"An Attempt to\r\nFormulate a Short, Fundamental, Clear Method to Enable Those without a\r\nTaste for Mathematics to Learn the Mathematics Necessary for the Higher\r\nand Technical Schools.\"\r\n\r\n[24] Fordham University Press, 1907.\r\n\r\n[25] Makers of Modern Medicine, Fordham University Press, New\r\nYork, 1907.\r\n\r\n[26] New York, Van Nostrand Company, 1891.\r\n\r\n[27] Published in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitute for the year 1891, Washington, 1893.\r\n\r\n[28] In the address on the scientific work of George Simon Ohm,\r\npublished by the Smithsonian Institute in 1891, this name is translated\r\nSangberg. In the article by Baurenfeind, in the Allegmeine Deutsche\r\nBiographie, the name is spelled Langberg. The form of the old German L\r\nmay have suggested the letter S, or it may have slipped in as a\r\ntypographical error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFARADAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maxim current among European scientists, that it is well to wait\r\nbefore accepting any scientific discovery to see what will be said about\r\nit on the other side of the Rhine, throws a rather curious sidelight on\r\nthe supposed absoluteness of scientific knowledge. Gallic enthusiasm or\r\nGerman subtlety may evolve plausible theories that look like scientific\r\ndiscoveries, but the destructive criticism of the neighbor nation\r\nusually saves the scientific world from deception. Not infrequently, the\r\nEnglish-speaking scientists held the balance between these rivals in the\r\nintellectual world, and their adhesion to either party or side of a\r\nquestion secured its dominance. When all three, Germans and French and\r\nEnglish, are agreed as to the value of a scientific discovery, then it\r\nmay be looked upon as having some of the absoluteness, or at least\r\npossesses for the moment the finality of scientific truth. If this\r\ntriple agreement be taken as the criterion of the significance of a\r\ngreat scientist's work, then must Michael Faraday be considered as\r\nwithout doubt one of the greatest scientists of our time, and probably\r\nthe greatest experimental scientist that the world has known.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MICHAEL FARADAY]\r\n\r\nDubois Reymond, in Berlin, declared Faraday \"the greatest\r\nexperimentalist of all times, and the greatest physical discoverer that\r\never lived.\" Professor Martius said before the Academy of Sciences at\r\nMunich, \"Deservedly has Faraday been called the greatest experimenter of\r\nhis epoch, and that the greatest epoch of scientific experimentation\r\ndown to our time.\" Dumas, the French chemist, in the panegyric delivered\r\nbefore the French Academy of Sciences, declared that Faraday was \"the\r\ngreatest scientific scholar that the Academy ever possessed.\" In order\r\nto give a picture of what he had accomplished in electricity, added\r\nDumas, one would have to write a complete treatise on that subject.\r\n\"There is nothing in this department of science that Faraday has not\r\ninvestigated completely or very materially modified. Much of this\r\nchapter of our modern science is his creation and belongs undeniably to\r\nhim.\" Beside these testimonies from French and German scientific\r\ncontemporaries must be placed Tyndall's appreciation, which sets forth\r\nhis brother scientist's merits. \"Take him all in all,\" he said, \"it must\r\nbe admitted, I think, that Michael Faraday was the greatest experimental\r\nscientist that the world has ever seen.\"\r\n\r\nNor did these magnificent appreciations of Faraday cease when the\r\nenthusiasm for his memory, immediately after his death, had faded\r\nsomewhat into sober realization of his merits. When Dumas summed up\r\nFaraday in the first Faraday lecture of the English Chemical Society, he\r\nsaid: \"Faraday was a type of the most fortunate and the most\r\naccomplished of the learned men of our age. His hand, in the execution\r\nof his conceptions, kept pace with his mind in designing them; he never\r\nwanted boldness when he undertook an experiment, never lacked resources\r\nto insure success, and was full of discretion when interpreting results.\r\nHis hardihood, which never halted once he had undertaken a task, and his\r\nwariness, which felt its way carefully in adopting a received\r\nconclusion, will ever serve as models for the experimentalist.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the life of Faraday should be of supreme interest for\r\na generation that is mainly interested in experimental science, and it\r\nso happens that his career contains many other sources of interest; for\r\nFaraday was a self-made man, who owed very little to anyone but himself\r\nand his own genius. Besides, he was a deep thinker with regard to all\r\nthe problems of human life as well as those of science, and while he was\r\na genial, kindly friend to those near him, the charming associate whom\r\nscientific intimates always welcomed, he had no illusions with regard to\r\nlife being the end of all things, but looked confidently to the\r\nhereafter, and shaped his life here from that point of view.\r\n\r\nMichael Faraday was born at Newington Butts, now called Stoke Newington,\r\nan outskirt of London, in Surrey, September 22d, 1791. His father was a\r\njourneyman blacksmith whose health was not very good, and as a\r\nconsequence, the family suffered not a little from poverty. Both his\r\nparents were noted for their good habits, industrious lives and deep\r\nreligious feelings. In spite of their poverty, as is much oftener the\r\ncase than is sometimes thought, their children were brought up very\r\ncarefully and had a precious training in high principles. Like most of\r\nhis great colleagues in scientific discovery, Faraday had to begin to\r\nearn his livelihood early in life. Of educational opportunities he had\r\npractically none. He learned to read and write, and probably had a\r\ncertain slight training in doing simple sums in arithmetic, but that\r\nwas the extent of his formal teaching, and much of that he got at home.\r\nHe had to help in the support of his family, and so it seemed fortunate\r\nthat not far away from his home there was a bookstore and bindery, the\r\nowner of which became interested in the Faradays and took Michael as an\r\nerrand boy when he was scarcely thirteen years of age.\r\n\r\nIt was here that the future scientist began his education for himself\r\nand, strange as it may seem, laid the deep foundation of his knowledge\r\nof science. For the first year he carried newspapers around to the\r\ncustomers, and did his work so faithfully that at the end of this time\r\nthe book-binder offered to take him as an apprentice to the trade,\r\nwithout the usual premium which used to be rather strictly required for\r\nteaching boys their trades at that time. Faraday accepted this offer,\r\nbut proved to be interested much more than in the outsides of the books\r\nhe bound. Whatever of leisure there was he took advantage of to read a\r\nnumber of works on experimental science that happened to be in the shop.\r\nLuckily for him, some of these were classics. As an introduction to\r\nchemistry, he had Mrs. Marcet's \"Conversations on Chemistry\" and Robert\r\nBoyle's \"Notes about the Producibleness of chimicall Principles.\" He was\r\neven more interested in electricity than in chemistry, however, and\r\nLyons' \"Experiments on Electricity\" and the article on electricity in\r\nthe Encyclopedia Britannica, whetted his interest and made the boy wish\r\nfor more of such information. There probably could not be a better proof\r\nof the fact that, a man who really has intellectual interests will find\r\nthe material with which to satisfy them, in spite of untoward\r\ncircumstances, than this boyish experience of Faraday.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious anticipation of Faraday's after-career that he at once\r\nbegan to demonstrate by personal experiment some of the statements that\r\nhe found in the books. He procured a stock of chemicals as far as his\r\nmeagre salary would allow, and constructed a practical electrical\r\nmachine, though he had nothing better than a large glass bottle to serve\r\nas a cylinder for it. When not yet fourteen, he noticed an advertisement\r\nof a set of lectures on natural philosophy. He was at once taken with\r\nthe idea of going to them, but the price of admission, one shilling,\r\nseemed to place them entirely beyond him. His elder brother, who\r\nfollowed his father's trade of blacksmith, had more money than he, and,\r\nwhen properly cajoled, was persuaded to provide the necessary shillings,\r\nand so Faraday got to the lectures. Elder brothers do not often have to\r\nlend shillings to their juniors for admission to scientific lectures now\r\nany more than in Faraday's time, so that the incident seems worth\r\nnoting.\r\n\r\nIn attendance at these lectures, Faraday not only learned much that was\r\nnew to him in science, but met a number of earnest fellow-students and\r\nformed some life-long friendships. He took copious notes, and afterwards\r\nwrote them out in a fine, legible hand, making excellent drawings in\r\nperspective of the apparatus employed in the experiments. His notes were\r\nso extensive that Faraday bound them himself, in four volumes, with an\r\nindex. These volumes are still preserved in the library of the Royal\r\nInstitution as one of the precious treasures among its Faraday\r\nrelics.[30] The whole story of these early years of Faraday's life is a\r\nseries of illustrations of how a young man without the necessary\r\nopportunities for his favorite studies can make them for himself.\r\nEverything seemed to be against his acquiring a thorough knowledge of\r\nscience, yet he succeeded in creating for himself the equivalent of a\r\ngood scientific course out of his meagre chances to hear lectures and\r\nread books on his favorite subject in the intervals of a busy life as\r\nbook-seller and book-binder.\r\n\r\nThings did not always continue to run along as pleasantly in life for\r\nyoung Faraday as while he was working for his book-binder friend as an\r\napprentice. With the conclusion of his apprenticeship he became a\r\njourneyman book-binder, and his first employer proved to be a hard\r\ntask-master. It did not matter how much work Faraday did or how well, it\r\nnever quite satisfied this French émigré, until it is no wonder that\r\nFaraday looked for another occupation. For a time, he had the congenial\r\noccupation of acting as amanuensis for Sir Humphry Davy, who, while\r\nworking on a new violent explosive, probably chloride of hydrogen, met\r\nwith an accident which prevented him from using his eyes for some time.\r\nThis occupation, pleasant and even alluring as it was, lasted only for a\r\nfew days, however. It had the fortunate result of suggesting to Faraday\r\nto apply to Sir Humphry Davy in person for a position not long after,\r\nand it eventually brought him the position of assistant at the Royal\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nHis anxiety to secure this post had been increased by the growing\r\nrealization that a business life was not to his liking. It seemed to him\r\na waste of time, or worse, for a man to give himself up to the making of\r\nmoney. Even thus young he had the ambition to add to the knowledge\r\npossessed by mankind, and the insatiable desire to increase the\r\nopportunities of others to learn whatever they were interested in.\r\nAccordingly, he set about finding the chance to devote himself entirely\r\nto science.\r\n\r\nIn writing years after to Dr. Paris, he says: \"My desire to escape from\r\ntrade, which I thought vicious and selfish, and to enter into the\r\nservice of science, which I imagined made its pursuers amiable and\r\nliberal, induced me at last to take the bold and simple step of writing\r\nto Sir Humphry Davy, expressing my wishes, and a hope that, if an\r\nopportunity came in his way, he should favor my views; and at the same\r\ntime I sent the notes I had taken of his lectures.\" Davy called, not\r\nlong after, on one of his friends, who was at the time honorary\r\ninspector of the models and apparatus at the Royal Institution, and with\r\nthe letter before him asked: \"Here is a letter from a young man named\r\nFaraday; he has been attending my lectures and wants me to give him\r\nemployment at the Royal Institution. What can I do?\" \"Do?\" replied the\r\ninspector; \"put him to wash bottles. If he is good for anything, he will\r\ndo it directly; if he refuses, he is good for nothing.\" \"No, no,\"\r\nreplied Davy, \"we must try him with something better than that.\"\r\n\r\nDavy wrote a kind reply, and arranged for an interview with young\r\nFaraday. In this, however, he candidly advised him to stick to his\r\nbusiness, telling him very plainly that \"science was a harsh mistress,\r\nand, from a pecuniary point of view, but poorly rewarded those who\r\ndevoted themselves to her service.\" He apparently put an end to all\r\nfurther consideration of the subject by promising Faraday the\r\nbook-binding work of the Institution, and his own besides.\r\n\r\nFaraday was not satisfied to go back to the book-shop, even with all\r\nthis kindly patronage, but there was nothing else for it, and so for a\r\ntime he continued at his duties and spent his spare moments reading\r\nscience and his evenings at scientific lectures, or in remaking the\r\nexperiments he had seen and others suggested by them, and above all in\r\nrewriting the notes that he had taken. There is no livelier picture in\r\nall the history of science, of how a man will, in spite of all\r\nobstacles, get the things he cares for, if he really cares for them,\r\nthan that of Faraday thus teaching himself science in the face of what\r\nseems almost insurmountable discouragement. Fortunately, not long after\r\nhe had been thus forcibly called to the attention of Sir Humphry Davy,\r\nthe former assistant in the laboratory of the Royal Institution not only\r\nneglected his duties, but became a source of considerable annoyance. His\r\nmisfortune proved Faraday's opportunity. He was offered the post. The\r\nsalary was only twenty-five shillings a week, but he accepted it very\r\nwillingly. One might think that at last his scientific career was opened\r\nfor him, but his new post was no sinecure. The labors required from him,\r\nindeed, were so manifold that it is somewhat surprising that he found\r\nany time for his own improvement. His duties as set forth in writing\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n     \"To attend and assist the lecturers and professors preparing for\r\n     and during lectures. Where any instruments or apparatus may be\r\n     required, to attend to their careful removal from the model room\r\n     and laboratory to the lecture room, and to clean and replace them\r\n     after being used, reporting to the managers such accidents as shall\r\n     require repair, a constant diary being kept by him for that\r\n     purpose. That in one day in each week he be employed in keeping\r\n     clean the models in the repository, and that all the instruments in\r\n     the glass cases be cleaned and dusted at least once within a\r\n     month.\"\r\n\r\nThe previous assistant had complained of the amount of work that was\r\nrequired of him. It is easy to see that his duties were rather exacting\r\nand time-taking. Faraday did not confine himself to them, though he did\r\nperform them with great assiduity. His interest in experimental\r\nchemistry was soon noted, and he was allowed to take his share in the\r\nexperiments going on in the laboratory. Some of his first work was the\r\nextraction of sugar from beet-root; but he was soon to have abundant\r\nexperience of the deterring side of chemistry. Not long after he began\r\nhis work in the laboratory, he had to manufacture some bisulphide of\r\ncarbon, one of the most nauseating of compounds. He found it disgusting\r\nenough as an experience, but the study of it brought its compensation.\r\n\r\nIt was much more than foul odors that Faraday had to encounter, for Davy\r\nwas still occupying himself with the study of the explosives, in the\r\ninvestigation of which he had been injured the previous year. Faraday\r\nsuffered from four or five explosions during the course of the first\r\nmonth or two of his employment. Indeed, the substance with which they\r\nwere experimenting proved so unreliable in this regard that, after a\r\nsecond rather serious injury to Davy, further study of it was given up.\r\n\r\nOnce Faraday had secured his post at the Royal Institution, his\r\nlife-work was before him, and he became deeply engaged in scientific\r\nspeculations, investigations and experiments of all kinds. The young man\r\nwho had found and made opportunities when they were so distant and\r\ndifficult, now made use of all that were so ready at hand. He did not\r\nconfine himself to his laboratory work, however, but seems always to\r\nhave felt that the contact of minds engaged along the same lines was the\r\nbest possible way to be stimulated to knowledge. He applied and was\r\nadmitted as member of the Philosophical Society of London, an\r\nassociation of some two score of men occupied with many things during\r\nthe day, but interested in science, so far as they could get the books\r\nand the opportunities for its study. They met every Wednesday evening\r\nand discussed various subjects in science or, as they called it then, in\r\nphilosophy, and they seem to have occupied themselves with many\r\nquestions in the social as well as the natural sciences. These men, most\r\nof whom were older than Faraday, soon came to look up to him because of\r\nthe depth and increasing breadth of his knowledge, and we have some\r\nemphatic expressions of their admiration for him.\r\n\r\nFaraday's earliest successful scientific investigation was accomplished\r\nin chemistry. This might have been expected, from the fact that he began\r\nhis work with Sir Humphry Davy, whose principal scientific\r\ninvestigations had been concerned with chemistry. His own great\r\nscientific work was to be done in electricity. Even in the brief time\r\nthat he devoted to chemistry, however, he succeeded in making some\r\ndiscoveries of deep significance. For instance, in his special study of\r\nchlorine, he demonstrated the existence of the two chlorides of carbon\r\nwhich had not hitherto been obtained. Above all, he impressed his\r\npersonality upon methods in chemistry. He was the first to realize how\r\nmuch technics were to mean in the modern advancement of science, and he\r\nmade methodic chemistry, in distinction from practical chemistry, the\r\nobject of very special study. His work on _Chemical Manipulation_ did\r\nmore to train successful students of chemistry and to make good\r\ninvestigators in this department of science than any other single work\r\nin his generation. It has continued to be of interest down even to our\r\nown time, and is well worthy of consultation by all those who are\r\ninterested in chemistry as a science, and especially in original\r\nresearch in that subject.\r\n\r\nIt was with regard to gases, however, that Faraday's most striking\r\nchemical work was done. He succeeded in liquefying several gases, and\r\nwas the first to make clear that all matter could probably exist in each\r\nof the three different states--solid, liquid and gaseous--according as\r\nthe proper conditions for each particular state were present. One might\r\nalmost have expected that the serious dangers incurred in his early days\r\nin the Royal Institution, when his chief, Sir Humphry Davy, suffered so\r\nseverely and he himself was more than once involved, might have deterred\r\nhim from further investigation along similar lines; but Faraday's ardor\r\nfor scientific investigation overcame any hesitancy there might have\r\nbeen. The effect of gases upon human beings proved as attractive to\r\nFaraday as it had been to Davy. His experiments upon chlorine threatened\r\nto prove seriously injurious to his throat, and he was warned of the\r\ndanger that he was running in the effort to determine whether such gases\r\nwere respirable and what their effects upon human beings were. The\r\nwarning was disregarded, however, though he exercised somewhat more care\r\nin subsequent observations. His experiments in the respiration of gases\r\nfinally led him to a discovery of cardinal importance in the very\r\npractical field of anæsthesia. Sir Humphry Davy, just at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, had made a series of interesting experiments\r\non nitrous oxide gas, the so-called \"laughing gas,\" and had pointed out\r\nvery definitely its anæsthetic properties. While suffering from\r\ntoothache he had inhaled the gas, and had experienced prompt alleviation\r\nof the pain. He described in detail these curious effects, and suggested\r\nthat there might be a place for nitrous oxide in surgery, at least for\r\nminor operations. The words he employed with regard to this subject show\r\nthat the idea of anæsthesia, as we now understand it, had come to him\r\nvery definitely. Not quite a score of years later, Faraday, recalling\r\nthe experiments of Davy with nitrous oxide, studied sulphuric ether, and\r\nshowed that the inhalation of the vapor of this substance produced\r\nanæsthetic effects very similar to those of nitrous oxide gas, but with\r\nthe possibility of prolonging them much more easily and apparently with\r\nless danger than would be the case with the latter. In every history of\r\nanæsthesia, these two sets of experiments at the Royal Institution must\r\nbe set down as foundation-stones, and Faraday's name particularly must\r\nbe hailed as one of the initiators of a supremely beneficent advance in\r\nmodern surgery.\r\n\r\nFaraday had given up business to devote himself to science, and he was\r\nnot to be seduced from the purpose of making his life unselfish and\r\ndoing things, not for money, but for the good of science and his own\r\nsatisfaction. As a practical chemist, he soon had many opportunities to\r\nincrease his salary by making analyses for industrial purposes. During\r\none year, the amount of work thus offered him was paid for so well that\r\nit formed an addition of some £500 sterling to his salary. It took away\r\nprecious time, however, that he might otherwise devote to original\r\nwork. As soon as Faraday realized this possibility of interference with\r\nhis scientific investigations, he cut it off, quite content to live on\r\nthe modest salary of his position at the Royal Institution. His action\r\nin the matter would remind one very much of Pasteur, in the latter half\r\nof the century, when asked by the Empress Eugénie, to whom he had been\r\njust exhibiting his discoveries in fermentation, whether he would not\r\napply these to actual manufacture and so make a fortune for himself in\r\nbrewing. Pasteur replied that he thought it unworthy of a French\r\nscientist to devote his time to money-making, with all the world of\r\nscience open before him.[29]\r\n\r\nWith a conscientious patriotism, however, that was typical of the man\r\nand his ways, there was one exception to this rule of not taking outside\r\nwork that Faraday made. In a letter to Lord Auckland, long afterward, he\r\nsays: \"I have given up for the last ten years or more, all professional\r\noccupation and voluntarily resigned a large income, that I might pursue\r\nin some degree my own objects of research. But in doing this I have\r\nalways, as a good subject, held myself ready to assist the government if\r\nstill in my power, but not for pay; for, except in one instance (and\r\nthen only for the sake of the person joined with me), I refused to take\r\nit. I have had the honor and pleasure of application, and that very\r\nrecently, from the Admiralty, the Ordnance, the Home Office, the Woods\r\nand Forests and other departments, all of which I have replied to and\r\nwill reply to as long as strength is left me.\"\r\n\r\nAs we have said, Faraday's principal work was accomplished in the domain\r\nof electricity. His supreme discovery, and, indeed, the most important\r\npractical discovery in the whole realm of electricity, was that of the\r\ninduction effect of a current of electricity on a neighboring circuit.\r\nThis was accomplished by experimental work of the highest order. Toward\r\nthe end of 1824, when he was about thirty-three, he came to the definite\r\nconclusion that an electric current might be obtained by the motion of a\r\nmagnet. His mind had been prepared for such a conclusion by Oersted's\r\nsignificant discovery in July, 1820, that an electric current acts\r\nsomewhat like a magnet when the wire through which it flows is free to\r\nmove. This discovery, definitely connecting electricity and magnetism,\r\nhad been elaborated to an important degree by Ampère, and its sphere of\r\napplication broadened by Wollaston. The curious though not unusual\r\nresult in such cases, that it is not those who are in immediate touch\r\nwith a great discoverer who develop or even apply his work, was\r\nillustrated by the fact that Ampère, the Frenchman, took up Oersted's\r\ndiscovery first, while Wollaston, working in England, had been the next\r\none to follow successfully in the path thus opened up. It takes genius\r\nto go even a slight step farther into the unknown; the trained talent of\r\ndisciples does not suffice. It was now Faraday, though not under\r\nWollaston's influence, who was to continue successfully these labors.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his persuasion that a magnet would produce by induction an\r\nelectric current, and the further step that a current in one wire could\r\ninduce a current in another, experiments during seven years had brought\r\nhim very little nearer the actual demonstration of this important\r\nprinciple. Those who think that great discoveries are made by accident\r\nand almost fall into the laps of their makers, as the apple upon Newton,\r\nshould recall these seven years of unsuccessful labor on the part of\r\nFaraday. Finally, in 1831, he obtained the first definite evidence that\r\nan electric current can induce another in a different circuit. The\r\ndiscovery meant so much for him, that he hesitated to believe in his own\r\nsuccess. Nearly a month after this first demonstration for himself, he\r\nwrote to his friend Phillips: \"I am busy just now again on\r\nelectro-magnetism, and think I have got hold of a good thing, but can't\r\nsay. It may be a weed instead of a fish that, after all my labor, I may\r\nat last pull up.\"\r\n\r\nHe had long suspected, as we have said, that induction should occur, and\r\nhe had tried currents of different strength, but without result. One day\r\nhe noticed that, though he could not produce a permanent induced\r\ncurrent, whenever the primary current started or stopped, there was a\r\nmovement of the galvanometer connected with the secondary circuit,\r\nthough the galvanometer remained at zero so long as the primary current\r\nflowed steadily. From this he proceeded to the demonstration that a bar\r\nmagnet suddenly thrust into a helix of copper wire produced the same\r\neffect on the galvanometer, and evidently induced a transient current.\r\nWhen the magnet was withdrawn, the galvanometer needle swung in the\r\nopposite direction, showing another current, so that electrical currents\r\nwere evidently induced by the relative motions of a magnet and a\r\nconductor. He continued his experiments in many different forms, and in\r\nthe short space of a little more than a week, once the first definite\r\nhint was obtained, succeeded in so completely finding out the phenomena\r\nof electro-magnetic induction that scarcely more than practical\r\napplications in this subject were left for his successors.\r\n\r\nFaraday's explanation of the induction of currents in the secondary\r\ncircuit was probably quite as important a contribution to science as the\r\nseries of experiments by which he demonstrated the occurrence of induced\r\ncurrents. His mind was not of the order that would accept action at a\r\ndistance; that is, without some conducting medium through which the\r\naction took place. The old aphorism of the scholastics, \"_actio in\r\ndistans repugnat_\"--action at a distance, that is, without a medium\r\nintervening, is absurd--would have appealed to him as a basic truth. The\r\nexplanation that he outlined for induced currents was based on the lines\r\nof magnetic force, which he had so often delineated by means of iron\r\nfilings. It was a favorite occupation of his, at moments of comparative\r\nleisure, to make varied pictures in iron filings of magnetic fields as\r\nthey were exhibited under the influence of different combinations of\r\nmagnets. He strewed iron filings over \"gum paper,\" and then when the\r\nfilings had arranged themselves in certain definite lines, he threw a\r\njet of steam on the paper, which melted the gum and fixed the filings in\r\nposition. He explained electrical action as the transmission of force\r\nalong such lines as these, and he thought the whole electric field was\r\nfilled with them.\r\n\r\nProbably the best summary of Faraday's work on induction and its\r\nsignificance has been given us by Clerk Maxwell, in his article on\r\nFaraday, in the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. There is\r\nno doubt but that Maxwell, above all men of the nineteenth century, was\r\nin a position to judge of the meaning of Faraday's work. He was not the\r\nsort of a man to say things in a panegyric mood, and his article on\r\nFaraday is indeed a model of well-considered judgment and critical\r\nillumination. Summing up the significance not only of Faraday's great\r\ndiscovery of induction, but also his theory in explanation of that\r\ndiscovery, he does not hesitate to say that his (Faraday's) opinion is\r\nthe nearest approach to truth that has been advanced in this\r\nmuch-discussed subject.\r\n\r\n\"After nearly half a century of labor of this kind, we may say that,\r\nthough the practical applications of Faraday's great discovery have\r\nincreased and are increasing in number and value every year, no\r\nexception to the statement of these laws as given by Faraday has been\r\ndiscovered; no new law has been added to them; and Faraday's original\r\nstatement remains to this day the only one which asserts no more than\r\ncan be verified by experiment, and the only one by which the theory of\r\nthe phenomena can be expressed in a manner which is actually and\r\nnumerically accurate, and at the same time within the range of\r\nelementary methods of exposition.\"\r\n\r\nWith what eminent care and absolute truth Faraday's conclusions were\r\nreached may be judged from some further expressions of Clerk Maxwell's\r\nin the article just quoted, with regard to the attitude of certain\r\nmathematicians toward Faraday's work. In this matter, Clerk Maxwell, in\r\ntalking on a theme that he had made especially his own, and in which his\r\nopinion must carry the greatest possible weight, said:\r\n\r\n\"Up to the present time, the mathematicians who have rejected Faraday's\r\nmethod of stating his law as unworthy of the precision of their science,\r\nhave never succeeded in devising any essentially different formula\r\nwhich shall fully express the phenomena, without introducing the\r\nhypotheses about the mutual action of things which have no physical\r\nexistence, such as elements of currents, which flow out of nothing, then\r\nalong the wire, and finally sink into nothing again.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's results were described in papers afterwards incorporated in\r\nhis first series of \"Experimental Researches,\" which were read before\r\nthe Royal Society, November 24th, 1841. These papers probably contain\r\nthe best possible proof of Faraday's genius as an experimentalist and a\r\nleader in scientific observation. Within a few months after his first\r\nsuccessful experiment, he had succeeded in bringing to perfection the\r\nwhole doctrine of induction by currents and magnets, had laid down the\r\nfundamental ideas which were to constitute the formal basis of\r\nelectro-magnetism for all time. Perhaps no better idea of the importance\r\nof the discovery thus made by Faraday can be given than will be found in\r\nClerk Maxwell's compendious paragraph on this subject, in his sketch of\r\nFaraday, in the Encyclopedia Britannica. It may be said that no one in\r\nall the nineteenth century was more capable of appreciating properly the\r\nvalue of Faraday's work than this great electrical mathematician, who\r\nlaid the firm foundation of mathematical electricity during the latter\r\npart of the nineteenth century. Clerk Maxwell says:\r\n\r\n\"This was of course a great triumph, and nobody appreciated this fact\r\nbetter than Faraday himself, who had been working at its problems for\r\nmany years. One of the first problems that he had set himself in his\r\nnote-book as a young man, was 'to convert magnetism into electricity,'\r\nand this he had now done. Within a month of the time that his first\r\nsuccessful experiment was formed, he succeeded in obtaining induction\r\ncurrents by means of the earth's magnetism. Within a year he took the\r\nfurther immense step of obtaining a spark from the induced current. This\r\nwould ordinarily have seemed quite impossible, since sparks occur only\r\nif the electromotive force is very high, and it was very low in his\r\ninduced currents. He found, however, that if the circuit of wire in\r\nwhich a current was flowing is broken while the current is passing, a\r\nlittle bridge of metallic vapor is formed, across which the spark leaps.\r\nThe difficulty with the experiment was to break the circuit during the\r\nextremely short period while the current is flowing. Faraday succeeded\r\nin doing this, and as a result obtained the first germ of the electric\r\nlight. When he demonstrated this experiment by a very ingenious\r\napparatus at the meeting of the British Association at Oxford, all were\r\ndeeply interested, yet probably no one, even the most sanguine of the\r\nscientists present, thought for a moment that they saw the beginning of\r\na far-reaching revolution of all the lighting of the world.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting of Faraday's discoveries, from the\r\nscientific standpoint, because they throw so much light on the problems\r\nof all the related phenomena of magnetism, heat, light, even\r\nelectricity, were those in which a ray of polarized light was used as a\r\nmeans of investigating the condition of transparent bodies when acted on\r\nby electric and magnetic forces. Faraday himself, when he was just\r\nthirty years of age, made a note in his commonplace laboratory book, in\r\nwhich all his observations were carefully detailed, that serves to show\r\nhow much this subject had begun to interest him thus early in his\r\ncareer. He mentions that he had polarized a ray of lamp-light by\r\nreflection, and had made various experiments to ascertain whether any\r\ndepolarizing action was exerted on it by water placed between the poles\r\nof a voltaic battery in a glass cistern, or by various fluids which were\r\ndecomposed by the voltaic action during the course of the experiment.\r\nBesides water, the fluids used were weak solutions of sulphate of soda\r\nand strong sulphuric acid. None of them had any effect on the polarized\r\nlight, either during the passage of the voltaic current or when this was\r\nshut off. No particular arrangement of particles in reference to\r\npolarized light could be found from these observations.\r\n\r\nSuch a note, with utter failure for conclusion, is common enough in\r\nFaraday's note-book. He was never discouraged, however, by failure at\r\nthe beginning. Once a subject has been taken up seriously, it is almost\r\ninevitable that further observations with regard to it will be found\r\nduring the course of the year. Because he had asked one question of\r\nnature and had not obtained a satisfactory answer, was never a reason\r\nwhy he should not ask further questions along the same line; and, above\r\nall, why he should not ask the same question in another way. After\r\nhaving tried a continuous current, Faraday next experimented on the\r\neffect of making and breaking the circuit. He did not expect very much\r\nfrom this, but he hoped that under circumstances when no decomposition\r\nwould ensue as the effect of the current, he might find some indication\r\nof the polarization. It was nearly twenty-five years before Faraday\r\nsucceeded in solving the problem that he had thus set himself as a young\r\nman, and nearly twenty years more were to pass before he made the\r\nrelation between magnetism and light the subject of his very last\r\nexperimental work. Nothing discouraged him. When he had resolved to\r\ninvestigate something, he continued to make his experiments over and\r\nover again in different ways, until finally he got an answer to his\r\nquestion and a solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nIndeed, his perseverance in anything that he undertook was a striking\r\ncharacteristic of the man and one of the most important elements in his\r\nsuccess in life. His tenacity of purpose showed itself equally in little\r\nas in great things. Arranging some apparatus one day with a\r\nphilosophical instrument-maker, he let fall on the floor a small piece\r\nof glass. He made several ineffectual attempts to pick it up. \"Never\r\nmind,\" said his companion, \"it is not worth the trouble.\" \"Well, but,\r\nMurray, I don't like to be beaten by something that I have once tried to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday was sure that there was some very definite relation between\r\nelectricity and light. His experiments, however, did not enable him to\r\ndemonstrate this until nearly fifteen years after his successful\r\nexperiment on induction. In September, 1845, he placed a piece of heavy\r\nglass made of silico-borate of lead in the field of a magnet, and found\r\nthat, when a beam of polarized light was transmitted through the glass\r\nin the direction of the lines of force, there was a rotation of the\r\nplane of polarization. Later experiments showed him that all transparent\r\nsolids and liquids were capable of producing this rotation in greater or\r\nless degree. When no magnet was used and the transparent substance was\r\nplaced within a coil of wire through which an electric current was\r\nflowing, similar effects were produced. This was the demonstration of a\r\ndefinite relation between light and electricity. Later, Faraday found\r\nthat magnets had a directive action upon the glass. He then made\r\nexperiments upon gases, and found that they too exhibited magnetic\r\nphenomena, and that, indeed, the diurnal variations of the\r\ncompass-needle were due to the sun's heat diminishing the magnetic\r\npermeability of the oxygen of the air. Further experiments with gases\r\nshowed him that nitrogen was absolutely neutral in its reaction.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected, from Faraday's early interest in chemistry,\r\nthat when he turned to electricity and made discoveries in that field of\r\nresearch, he would naturally take up the problem of tracing the laws and\r\ndemonstrating the relationships of the points of contact of the two\r\ngreat sciences. After his completion, then, of the subject of induction,\r\nFaraday devoted himself to the experimental proof of the identity of\r\nfrictional and voltaic electricity, and to showing that chemistry and\r\nphysics have a common ground. His inductive electrical machine could\r\ndeflect a magnet and decompose iodide of potash. With his tendency to\r\nmeasure things, he determined that the amount of electricity required to\r\ndecompose a grain of water was equal to 800,000 charges of his large\r\nbattery of Leyden jars. On the other hand, the current from a frictional\r\nmachine deflected the needle of his galvanometer in the same way as the\r\ninduced current of electricity, so that all the elements of the proof of\r\nthe identity of the two forms of phenomena were now in his hands.\r\n\r\nThat he should have proceeded to the demonstration of the laws of\r\nelectrolysis, was the next most natural result. He showed that the\r\namount of any compound decomposed by the electric current is exactly\r\nproportional to the whole quantity of electricity which has passed\r\nthrough the electrolyte. Different substances are variously refractory\r\nto dissolution under the influence of the electric current, but each one\r\nalways acts in the same way and requires the same amount of current.\r\nSubstances that are closely related to one another chemically, are also\r\nrelated to one another in the amount of electricity required to bring\r\nabout decomposition of their various compounds. He showed, of course,\r\nthat there are differences of electrical relationship that make the\r\nresults produced in the decomposition of various compounds very\r\ndifferent. Polarization, for instance, sets in to a much greater degree\r\nin the decomposition of some substances than of others. One consequence\r\nis that the resistance to the passage of the electric current differs\r\nmarkedly, and the opposing electromotive force will stop the current or\r\nhamper its effects in many cases, so that, until after actual\r\nexperiment, the quantitative effect of the passage of the electric\r\ncurrent through a solution cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nFaraday's opinions as to the significance of electricity in the animal\r\neconomy are very interesting because of his profound knowledge of\r\nelectrical phenomena and their place in nature. It is all the more\r\ninteresting because it is so simple, and most scientists would be apt to\r\nsay that its very simplicity is a very taking argument for its truth.\r\n\"As living creatures produce heat, and a heat certainly identical with\r\nthat of our hearths, why should they not produce electricity also, and\r\nan electricity in like manner identical with that of our machines? Like\r\nheat, like chemical action, electricity is an implement of life, and\r\nnothing more.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Faraday often occupied himself with subjects connected with matter\r\nand force that are likely to remain mysteries for long after his time,\r\nand often had thoughts to express with regard to the nature of atoms and\r\nof imponderable agents, whatever he had to say about these subjects was\r\nnot vague and speculative, but, on the contrary, was concrete and\r\nusually of such a practical character as to add something new to our\r\nknowledge of them. Few men have ever succeeded in getting closer to the\r\nmysteries that underlie natural phenomena than Faraday; yet no one was\r\never less carried away into vague theoretic speculations with regard to\r\nthem, nor tempted to think that because he knew much more than most\r\nother men with regard to complex natural problems, that therefore he\r\nknew enough to be able to solve the mysteries that existed all around\r\nhim. He had none at all of what would ordinarily be called pride of\r\nintellect, but, on the contrary, had the humility of the true scientist.\r\nKnowing so much only made him realize more poignantly how much he was\r\nignorant of. With regard to his speculations on matter and force and the\r\nimponderables, Helmholtz, the great German physicist, once summed up\r\nFaraday's contributions very succinctly in a way to show the practical\r\nnature of Faraday's intellect. He said:\r\n\r\n\"It is these things that Faraday in his mature works ever seeks to\r\npurify more and more from everything that is theoretical and is not the\r\ndirect and simple expression of the fact. For instance, he contended\r\nagainst the action of forces at a distance, and the adoption of two\r\nelectrical and two magnetic fluids, as well as all hypotheses contrary\r\nto the law of the conservation of force, which he early foresaw, though\r\nhe misunderstood it in its scientific expression. And it is just in\r\nthis direction that he exercised the most unmistakable influence, first\r\nof all, on the English physicist, and then on the physicists of all the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nInventors and promoters of useful inventions, frequently benefited by\r\nthe advice of Faraday or by his general help. A remarkable instance of\r\nthis was told by Mr. Cyrus W. Field. At the commencement of his great\r\nenterprise, when he wished to unite the Old and the New World by the\r\ntelegraphic cable, he sought the advice of the great electrician, and\r\nFaraday told him that he doubted the possibility of getting a message\r\nacross the Atlantic. Mr. Field saw that this fatal objection must be\r\nsettled at once, and begged Faraday to make the necessary experiments,\r\noffering to pay him properly for his services. The philosopher, however,\r\ndeclined all remuneration, but worked away at the question, and\r\npresently reported to Mr. Field: \"It can be done; but you will not get\r\nan instantaneous message.\" \"How long will it take?\" was the inquiry.\r\n\"Oh! perhaps a second.\" \"Well, that's quick enough for me,\" was the\r\nconclusion of the American; and the enterprise was proceeded with.\r\n\r\nFaraday was far from being a mere laboratory student; he was much more\r\neven than a great teacher of physics. He was a magnificent popular\r\nlecturer, and did an incalculable amount to bring physics to the\r\nattention and the serious interest of his generation. A contemporary has\r\ndescribed one of his lectures at the Royal Institution in such a way as\r\nto give us some idea, even at this distant date, of Faraday's power over\r\nhis audience, of his own wonderful interest in the subject and his\r\nmarvelous ability to communicate that interest to others. It was of the\r\nvery nature of the man that he should not be cold and formal, for he was\r\nnot a man of the head alone, but, above all, a man whose heart and\r\naffections were greatly developed, and he had powers of enthusiasm that\r\nplaced him high among the artistic spirits of mankind. Our American\r\npoet, Stedman, once declared that the intellectual quality of the poet,\r\nthe creator in the realm of thought, and of the scientist, the original\r\nworker in the domain of science, differed but little from one another,\r\nand must be considered as collateral expressions of the same form of\r\nintellectual genius. With this in mind, his contemporary's enthusiastic\r\ndescription of his lectures will not seem overdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"It was an irresistible eloquence, which compelled attention and\r\ninsisted upon sympathy. It waked the young from their visions, and the\r\nold from their dreams. There was a gleaming in his eyes which no painter\r\ncould copy, and which no poet could describe. Their radiance seemed to\r\nsend a strange light into the very heart of his congregation; and when\r\nhe spoke, it was felt that the stir of his voice and the fervor of his\r\nwords could belong only to the owner of those kindling eyes. His thought\r\nwas rapid, and made itself a way in new phrases, if it found none ready\r\nmade, as the mountaineer cuts steps in the most hazardous ascent with\r\nhis own axe. His enthusiasm sometimes carried him to the point of\r\necstasy.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's habit of testing opinions by experiment, and the frequent\r\ndisillusions which he encountered with regard to things of which he\r\nthought he knew something definite, served to make him extremely\r\ncareful as regards expressions of opinion. Some of his thoughts on this\r\nsubject are worth while recalling because they remain perennially true,\r\nand anyone in any generation will find that, as his experience grows, he\r\ngets more and more into this Faraday mood of doubting his own opinion\r\nand listening with more readiness to that of others. As a rule, this is\r\nsaid not to be true of those who are in advancing years, but the greater\r\nminds among the older men do not get set in their ways. Flourens might\r\nhave said that because of constant exercise the connective tissue in the\r\nbrains of such men does not form to the same extent as in others, and\r\ndoes not make them case-hardened. As a consequence, they retain far on\r\nin years their sympathy for others' opinions and their openness of mind.\r\nComparatively, they are so few, however, that this expression of\r\nFaraday's becomes a striking commentary on his large-mindedness.\r\n\r\n\"For proper self-education, it is necessary that a man examine himself,\r\nand that not carelessly either.... A first result of this habit of mind\r\nwill be an internal conviction of ignorance in many things respecting\r\nwhich his neighbors are taught, and that his opinions and conclusions on\r\nsuch matters ought to be advanced with reservation. A mind so\r\ndisciplined will be open to correction upon good grounds in all things,\r\neven in those it is best acquainted with, and should familiarize itself\r\nwith the idea of such being the case.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is even more interesting, because more humanly sympathetic,\r\nto find that Faraday distrusted his opinions of people even more than\r\nhis opinions of things, and that he himself tried to be very slow to\r\ntake offence at what was said to him, and counselled greatest discretion\r\nto others in judging of the significance of supposed slights.\r\n\r\n\"Let me, as an old man who ought by this time to have profited by\r\nexperience, say that when I was younger, I found I often misinterpreted\r\nthe intentions of people, and found that they did not mean what at the\r\ntime I supposed they meant; and further, that, as a general rule, it was\r\nbetter to be a little dull of apprehension when phrases seemed to imply\r\npique and quick in perception, when, on the contrary, they seemed to\r\nimply kindly feeling. The real truth never fails ultimately to appear,\r\nand opposing parties, if wrong, are sooner convinced when replied to\r\nforbearingly than when overwhelmed.\"\r\n\r\nFew lives have been happier than that of Faraday. He gave up the\r\nordinary ambition of men to make what is called a successful career of\r\nmoney-making, and constantly guarded himself from slipping back, as so\r\nmany do, to the ruin of their original purpose. He lived a long life in\r\npeace, occupied with work that he liked above all things, and surely\r\nserves as the best illustration of the maxim: \"Blessed is the man who\r\nhas found his work.\" Work is said to be one of the primal curses laid\r\nupon man; but if, when the Creator would ban it turns to blessing in the\r\nway that work has done, then may one well ask what will His blessings\r\nprove. Faraday even had what is rarer in life than happiness, the\r\nconsciousness of his happiness. Usually it is so elusive that it escapes\r\nreflection. At the close of his career, when he wrote, in 1861, to the\r\nmanagers of the Royal Institution resigning most of his duties, he\r\nexpressed this feeling very beautifully, and at the same time so simply\r\nand clearly as to make his letter of resignation a precious bit of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\"I entered the Royal Institution in March, 1813, nearly forty-nine years\r\nago, and, with the exception of a comparatively short period, during\r\nwhich I was abroad on the continent with Sir H. Davy, I have been with\r\nyou ever since. During that time I have been most happy in your\r\nkindness, and in the fostering care which the Royal Institution has\r\nbestowed upon me. Thank God, first, for all His gifts! I have next to\r\nthank you and your predecessors for the unswerving encouragement and\r\nsupport which you have given me during that period. My life has been a\r\nhappy one, and all I desired. During its progress, I have tried to make\r\na fitting return for it to the Royal Institution, and through it to\r\nscience. But the progress of years (now amounting in number to\r\nthree-score and ten) having brought forth, first, the period of\r\ndevelopment, and then that of maturity, has ultimately produced for me\r\nthat of gentle decay. This has taken place in such a manner as to make\r\nthe evening of life a blessing; for, while increasing physical weakness\r\noccurs, a full share of health, free from pain, is granted with it; and\r\nwhile memory and certain other faculties of the mind diminish, my good\r\nspirits and cheerfulness do not diminish with them.\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly five years after he had given up to a great degree his work\r\nat the Royal Institution, he faced death, not with the equanimity of the\r\nstoic, but with the peaceful happiness of the believer in Providence and\r\na hereafter. Even the loss of his memory, dear as it must have been to a\r\nman who had spent all his life in storing it with the great facts of\r\nscience, does not seem seriously to have disturbed him. He realized the\r\nnecessity for patience, and took the lesson of its necessity to heart,\r\nso that there was no difficulty in it. Once when calling on his friend,\r\nthe distinguished scientist, Barlow, who had for a lifetime almost\r\nworked beside him at the Royal Institution, but who was now suffering\r\nfrom paralysis, he said: \"Barlow, you and I are waiting; that is what we\r\nhave to do now; and we must try to do it patiently.\" When the full\r\nrealization that his powers were leaving him first came to him, he wrote\r\nto his niece what he thought ought to be the feelings of the believer in\r\nProvidence toward death, and his letter shows how thoroughly he had\r\nimbibed the great lessons of Christianity, and how much of consolation\r\nhis faith was to him in this darkest hour before the dawn of that other\r\nlife, in which he had as implicit confidence as in any of the great\r\nscientific principles that he had demonstrated by experiment. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think that death has, to the Christian, anything in it that\r\nshould make it a rare, or other than a constant thought. Out of the\r\nthought of death comes the view of the life beyond the grave, as out of\r\nthe view of sin (that true and real view which the Holy Spirit alone can\r\ngive to man) comes the glorious Hope.... My worldly faculties are\r\nslipping away day by day. Happy is it for all of us, that the true good\r\nlies not in them. As they ebb, may they leave us as little children,\r\ntrusting in the Father of Mercies and accepting His unspeakable gift.\"\r\nAnd when the dark shadow was creeping over him, he wrote to the Comte de\r\nParis: \"I bow before Him who is the Lord of all, and hope to be kept\r\nwaiting patiently for His time and mode of releasing me, according to\r\nHis divine word and the great and precious promises whereby His people\r\nare made partakers of the divine nature.\"\r\n\r\nProbably the feature of the careers of Darwin and Spencer which are\r\nsaddest for their adherents, and which made those who refused to be\r\nrecognized as among their followers appreciate their one-sidedness, is\r\nthe confession by both of them, that they had lost their interest in\r\npoetry and even in literature of all kinds, and toward the end of their\r\nlives particularly lost entirely their appreciation of things artistic.\r\nAs might be expected from what we know of Faraday, this was not at all\r\nthe case with him; but, on the contrary, down to the end of his life, he\r\nretained all his youthful admiration for the poets. His niece tells the\r\nstory of hearing him often read poetry, and of how much he used to be\r\naffected by his favorite poems. In one of her letters she says:\r\n\r\n\"But of all things, I used to like to hear him read 'Childe Harold'; and\r\nnever shall I forget the way in which he read the description of the\r\nstorm on Lake Leman. He took great pleasure in Bryon, and Coleridge's\r\n'Hymn to Mont Blanc' delighted him. When anything touched his feelings\r\nas he read--and it happened not infrequently--he would show it not only\r\nin his voice, but by tears in his eyes also.\"\r\n\r\nAs a young man, he was so completely taken up with the scientific\r\nstudies that he could not think that he would ever find time for the\r\nordinary interests of life. Especially was this true with regard to the\r\nquestion of marriage. He felt that he would never marry, and he seems\r\nrather to have pitied those, the weakness of whose nature pushed them on\r\nto assume many duties in life and look for merely selfish happiness. It\r\nwas as a very young man that he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"What is't that comes in false, deceitful guise,\r\n    Making dull fools of those that 'fore were wise?\r\n                                          'Tis Love.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, however, he altered this opinion. Among the elders\r\nof the Church which he attended in London was a Mr. Barnard, a\r\nsilversmith. Faraday occasionally spent an evening at his house, and\r\nincidentally met his daughter Sarah. He had not met her many times\r\nbefore his ideas as to what love might mean in life were completely\r\nchanged, and not long after making her acquaintance he wrote her a\r\nletter, in which he recants and asks her to be more than a friend. His\r\nletter is rather interesting as love letters go.\r\n\r\n\"You know me as well or better than I do myself. You know my former\r\nprejudices and my present thoughts; you know my weaknesses, my vanity,\r\nmy whole mind; you have converted me from one erroneous way; let me hope\r\nthat you will attempt to correct what others are wrong.... Again and\r\nagain I attempt to say what I feel, but I cannot. Let me, however, claim\r\nnot to be the selfish being that wishes to bend his affections for his\r\nown sake only. In whatever way I can best minister to your happiness,\r\neither by assiduity or by absence, it shall be done. Do not injure me by\r\nwithdrawing your friendship, or punish me for aiming to be more than a\r\nfriend by making me less; and if you cannot grant me more, leave me what\r\nI possess but hear me.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the sincere feeling of this letter, the lady hesitated. For\r\na time she left London, apparently in order to give herself a breathing\r\nspell from the ardor of his suit. In spite of his deep interest in\r\nscience, Faraday followed her to the seacoast, and after they had\r\nwandered together for several days at Margate and Dover, where\r\nShakespeare's Cliff Was an especial haunt of theirs, the lady relented.\r\nFaraday returned to London bubbling over with happiness. He was not\r\nquite thirty when they were married, and at the time his salary did not\r\namount to more than a thousand dollars a year. It was distinctly not a\r\nmarriage of reason.\r\n\r\nMost of the happiness of his life came to him from his marriage. Many\r\nyears afterward, he called it \"An event which, more than any other,\r\ncontributed to my happiness and healthful state of mind.\" With years,\r\nthis feeling only deepened and strengthened. In the midst of his\r\nscientific triumphs, his first thought was always of her. When his\r\nattendance at scientific congresses took him away from her, his letters\r\nwere frequent, and always expressive of his longing to be with her. One\r\nof his biographers has said \"that doubtless at any time between their\r\nmarriage and his final illness, he might have written to her as he did\r\nfrom Birmingham, at the time of the meeting of the British Association\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all, there is no pleasure like the tranquil pleasure of home; and\r\nhere, the moment I leave the table, I wish I were with you _in quiet_.\r\nOh! what happiness is ours! My runs into the world in this way only\r\nserve to make me esteem that happiness the more.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday had probably lost more illusions than most men, and came to the\r\ntrue appreciation of things as they are. In spite of his life-long\r\nstudy, he had no illusions with regard to the education of the intellect\r\nmerely, or the possession of superior intellectual faculties as moral\r\nfactors. His keen observation of men had made any such mistake as that\r\nimpossible. On the other hand, he had often noted that the ignorant, or\r\nat least those lacking education, were very admirable in conduct and in\r\nprinciple, and so we have his suggestive testimony:\r\n\r\n\"I should be glad to think that high mental powers insured something\r\nlike a high moral sense, but have often been grieved to see the\r\ncontrary; as also, on the other hand, my spirit has been cheered by\r\nobserving in some lowly and uninstructed creature such a healthful and\r\nhonorable and dignified mind as made one in love with human nature. When\r\nthat which is good mentally and morally meet in one being, that that\r\nbeing is more fitted to work out and manifest the glory of God in the\r\ncreation, I fully admit.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's very definite expression of what he considers must be the\r\nposition of the man of science with regard to a hereafter and the\r\nexistence of God, is worth while recalling here, because it was such a\r\nmodest yet forceful presentation of the attitude of mind that every\r\nthinking modern scientist must occupy in this matter, the attitude which\r\nall of Faraday's great fellow-workers in the domain of electricity also\r\noccupy. It is indeed the position that has been assumed by all the great\r\nscientists who bowed humbly to faith, though so many lesser lights have\r\nfound this apparently impossible. At a lecture given in 1854 at the\r\nRoyal Institution, Faraday said: \"High as man is placed above the\r\ncreatures around him, there is a higher and far more exalted position\r\nwithin his view; and the ways are infinite in which he occupies his\r\nthoughts about the fears, or hopes, or expectations of a future life. I\r\nbelieve that the truth of that future cannot be brought to his\r\nknowledge by any exertion of his mental powers, however exalted they may\r\nbe; that it is made known to him by other teaching than his own, and is\r\nreceived through simple belief of the testimony given.... Yet even in\r\nearthly matters, I believe that 'the invisible things of Him from the\r\ncreation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things\r\nthat are made, even His eternal power and godhead'; and I have never\r\nseen anything incompatible between those things of man which can be\r\nknown by the spirit of man which is within him, and those higher things\r\nconcerning his future which he cannot know by that spirit.\"\r\n\r\nElsewhere he had said: \"When I consider the multitude of associate\r\nforces which are diffused through nature; when I think of that calm and\r\ntranquil balancing of their energies which enables elements, most\r\npowerful in themselves, most destructive to the world's creatures and\r\neconomy, to dwell associated together and be made subservient to the\r\nwants of creation, I rise from the contemplation more than ever\r\nimpressed with the wisdom, the beneficence, and grandeur beyond our\r\nlanguage to express, of the Great Disposer of all!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gladstone, in his Life of Faraday, which we have so often put into\r\nrequisition, has given in one striking paragraph a description of the\r\npassing of Faraday, that in its simplicity is worthy of the great man\r\nwhom it so well represents. It is so different from what is ordinarily\r\nsupposed to be the attitude of the scientist towards death, that when by\r\ncontrast we recall that Faraday is acknowledged to be the greatest\r\nexperimental scientist of the nineteenth century, the man of his\r\ngeneration most honored by scientific societies at home and abroad--his\r\nhonorary memberships numbered nearly one hundred--it must be considered\r\nas a very curious contradiction of what is the usual impression in this\r\nmatter: \"When his faculties were fading fast, he would sit long at the\r\nwestern window, watching the glories of the sunset; and one day, when\r\nhis wife drew his attention to a beautiful rainbow that then spanned the\r\nsky, he looked beyond the falling shower and the many-colored arch and\r\nobserved, 'He hath set His testimony in the heavens.' On August 25th,\r\n1867, quietly, almost imperceptibly, came the release. There was a\r\nphilosopher less on earth, and a saint more in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the end of the life of this greatest of\r\nexperimentalists, the most striking remembrance is that of the supreme\r\noriginal genius of this great discoverer in electricity, whose work was\r\nsuch a stimulus to others, whose conclusions were to prove the basis for\r\nso much of the work of his contemporaries and his successors in\r\nelectrical investigation, and whose place in the world of science is\r\nassured beside such men as Newton and Kepler and Harvey and the other\r\ngreat pioneers in science. There is no doubt at all, however, that our\r\nheartiest feelings are aroused by the picture of the wonderfully rounded\r\nexistence of the great scientist, his pervasive humanity, his largeness\r\nof soul and sympathy, his understanding of men in their ways through his\r\nown complete knowledge of himself, that is so strikingly displayed. We\r\nfeel sure that Faraday himself would have cared less for his fame as a\r\ngreat scientist than for the summary of his life which has been given us\r\nby his friend, Bence Jones, who said: \"His was a life-long strife, to\r\nseek and say that which he thought was true and to do that which he\r\nthought was kind.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Some of the books bound by Faraday at this time are still\r\npreserved in the library of the Royal Institution, together with his\r\nnotes on various courses of lectures, some of which are mentioned more\r\nparticularly later on in this sketch, as they were also bound by him.\r\nAmong the manuscripts in the collection are letters from many of the\r\nimportant scientific scientists of Europe.\r\n\r\n[30] Makers of Modern Medicine, Fordham University Press, N.\r\nY., 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nCLERK MAXWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural science in every department developed very wonderfully from its\r\nexperimental side during the first half of the nineteenth century. Facts\r\nand observations accumulated to such an amount that, shortly after the\r\nmiddle of the century, there was felt the need of a great mathematical\r\ngenius to bring the results of experiment into their proper places in\r\nthe great body of applied and theoretic science. Nearly always such a\r\ndemand meets with adequate response in its own due time. Clerk Maxwell\r\ncame at this most opportune moment for science. No mathematical problem\r\nwas too abstruse or difficult for him, and whatever he took up seriously\r\nhe always illuminated, and usually solved its problems as completely as\r\ncan be hoped for in the present state of scientific knowledge. It was\r\nparticularly in electricity that his mathematical faculty proved of the\r\ngreatest value, and that he found the abundant opportunities of which he\r\nknew so well how to take advantage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JAMES CLERK MAXWELL]\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell's theory of electricity, as developed in his classic\r\ntreatise on \"Electricity and Magnetism,\" is well called by Prof. Peter\r\nGuthrie Tait, \"One of the most splendid monuments ever raised by the\r\ngenius of a single individual.\" This book became the guide and companion\r\nof more physical scientists during the nineteenth century than perhaps\r\nany other written in that period. It was not alone in England or in\r\nEnglish-speaking countries that it was accepted as an authority and\r\nconstantly referred to, but everywhere throughout the world of science.\r\nNot to know it, was to argue that a man knew nothing of the profounder\r\ntruths of electrical science and was only a seeker after superficial\r\ninformation. Clerk Maxwell was known and esteemed by all the great\r\nphysical scientists of the world. His name is less widely known than\r\nthat of most of the great discoverers in electricity, because\r\nmathematical achievement always has less popular attraction; but he\r\ndeserves to be known by all who are interested in science, not only\r\nbecause of his magnificent contributions to mathematical electricity,\r\nbut quite as much for qualities of heart and mind that stamp him as one\r\nof the very great men of the century so rapidly receding from us.\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell, as he is usually called, because he was the\r\nrepresentative of a younger branch of the well-known Scottish family of\r\nClerk of Penicuik, was born in Edinburgh, June 13th, 1831. As with\r\nnearly every other person who reaches distinction in after-life, there\r\nare stories told of his precociousness which probably have more meaning\r\nin this case than in most others, since they exhibit real traits that\r\nwere characteristic of the man. As a child, it is said that he was never\r\nsatisfied until he had found out for himself everything that he could\r\nabout anything that attracted his attention. He wanted to know where the\r\nstreams of water came from, where and whence all the pipes ran, and the\r\ncourse of bell-wires and the like. His frequently repeated question was,\r\n\"What's the go o' that.\" If an attempt were made to put him off with\r\nsome indefinite answer, then he would insist, \"But what's the particular\r\ngo of it.\" This was probably the most prominent trait in his after-life.\r\nGeneral explanations of phenomena that satisfied other men never\r\nsatisfied him. He was a nature student from the beginning, and even as a\r\nboy he devised all sorts of ingenious mechanical contrivances. Pet\r\nanimals were his special delight, but for experimental purposes always,\r\nand his selection of pets would probably have startled some people.\r\n\r\nHe received his early education at the Edinburgh Academy, and his\r\nuniversity education at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated\r\nin 1850. His liking for mathematics, which had already been very\r\nstrongly exhibited, led him, at the age of nineteen, to go to Cambridge.\r\nHere, for a term or two, he was a student at Peterhouse, but afterwards\r\nfound a more sympathetic place for his mathematical tastes at Trinity.\r\nHe took his degree at Cambridge in 1854, though only with the rank of\r\nsecond wrangler, Routh being senior. In the more serious and more\r\nexacting examination for the Smith's Prize, he was declared equal with\r\nthe senior wrangler. His mathematical talents had developed very early,\r\nand it is not surprising that the rest of his life should have been\r\ndevoted mainly to the teaching of mathematics and in investigations\r\nconnected with applied mathematics. It was not success at the university\r\nthat determined his career, for he had shown his marvelous mathematical\r\nability much earlier than that, and had given some astonishing examples\r\nof his power to treat complex scientific problems in mathematical\r\njournals.\r\n\r\nIndeed, his original contributions to the higher mathematics began\r\nbefore he was fifteen years of age. He was a striking example of the\r\nfact that a great genius usually finds his work very early in life, and\r\nusually accomplishes something significant in it, at once the harbinger\r\nand the token of the future, before he is twenty-five. While Clerk\r\nMaxwell was at the Edinburgh Academy, Professor J. D. B. Forbes, in\r\n1836, communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a short paper by\r\nhis youthful student on \"A Mechanical Method of Tracing Oval Curves\"\r\n(Cartesian Ovals).\r\n\r\nIn spite of the prejudice that exists with regard to precocious genius\r\nand the distinct feeling that it is not likely to prove an enduring\r\nquality, Clerk Maxwell continued to do excellent original work all\r\nthrough his teens. When he was but eighteen, he contributed two\r\nimportant papers to the transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\r\nOne of these was on \"The Theory of Rolling Curves,\" and the other on\r\n\"The Equilibrium of Elastic Solids.\" These are now remembered, not only\r\nbecause of Clerk Maxwell's subsequent distinguished career, but because\r\nof their distinct value as contributions to science. Both of them\r\ndemonstrate not only his ability to work out subtle mathematical\r\nproblems at this very early age, but show the possession by him of a\r\npower of investigation for original work that stamps them as well worthy\r\nof consideration in themselves, quite apart from the repute of their\r\nauthor or the successful accomplishments of his subsequent life.\r\n\r\nWith regard to one of those Edinburgh papers of Clerk Maxwell's\r\neighteenth year, Prof. Guthrie Tait said \"that in it he laid the\r\nfoundation of one of the singular discoveries of his later life, the\r\ntemporary double refraction produced in viscous liquid by sheering\r\nstress.\" After his magnificent mathematical training at Cambridge, it is\r\nnot surprising that this academic career of great original work should\r\nbe continued by contributions to science of ever-increasing importance.\r\nImmediately after his graduation, he read to the Cambridge Philosophical\r\nSociety one of the few purely mathematical papers that he ever\r\npublished. This had for its title, \"On the Transformation of Surfaces by\r\nBending.\" Expert mathematicians who read the paper, realized at once\r\nthat there was a new genius in the field of mathematics. During the same\r\nyear, the young Scotch mathematician took the first step in that series\r\nof electrical investigations which was to occupy so much of his\r\nattention in after-life, and which was to prove the source of his\r\ngreatest inspirations. This consisted of the publication of an elaborate\r\npaper on Faraday's \"lines of force.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we think of Maxwell as a mathematical physicist, it must not be\r\nforgotten that he was also one of the leading experimental scientists of\r\nthat great epoch, the nineteenth century. Only a man who was himself a\r\ngreat experimenter could have properly appreciated and developed, from\r\nthe mathematical standpoint, the works of such men as Cavendish and\r\nFaraday. From his early years, Maxwell displayed a distinct fondness for\r\nexperimentation, and this even extended to experiments upon himself. In\r\nmany ways this trait of his would remind us of Johann Müller, the great\r\nfather of modern German medicine.[34] Like Müller, there was danger also\r\nof Maxwell's experiments on himself getting him into trouble. For\r\ninstance, at one time his love of experiment led him to try sleeping in\r\nthe evening and getting up to work at midnight, so as to have the long,\r\nsilent hours of the night to himself. In the sketch of his life by Dr.\r\nGarnett,[32] a letter from one of his friends is quoted with regard to\r\nthis nocturnal habit, which is amusing as well as interesting. The\r\nfriend wrote:\r\n\r\n\"From 2 to 2:30 a. m. he took exercise by running along the upper\r\ncorridor, down the stairs, along the lower corridor, then up the stairs,\r\nand so on until the inhabitants of the rooms along his track got up and\r\nlaid _perdus_ behind their sporting doors, to have shots at him with\r\nboots, hair-brushes, etc., as he passed.\" His love of fun, his sharp\r\nwit, his extensive knowledge, and, above all, his complete\r\nunselfishness, rendered him a universal favorite, in spite of the\r\ntemporary inconveniences which his experiments may have occasionally\r\ncaused to his fellow-students.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Clerk Maxwell received the Adams Prize for his essay on \"The\r\nStability of the Motion of Saturn's Rings.\" He shows very clearly that\r\nthese annular appendages consist of a large number of small masses. This\r\nwork would seem to be very distant from anything that Maxwell had\r\nattempted before, and would indeed seem to the superficial observer, at\r\nleast, to be quite out of his sphere. It was the mathematics of it that\r\nattracted him, and the fact that the problem was difficult, indeed, one\r\nof the most difficult at that time before astronomers, only added zest\r\nto his resolve to fathom it. All his life, mathematics continued to be\r\nhis favorite form of work, and his power to express the most complex\r\nphysical phenomena in mathematical formulæ gave him a reputation\r\nthroughout Europe unsurpassed by anyone of his generation. The more a\r\nproblem seemed incapable of direct statement in mathematical terms,\r\nprovided it represented a great occurrence in nature, the more Maxwell\r\nwas attracted to it; and the training of these early years in thus\r\nsetting mathematics to the solution of physical relations, was to serve\r\nhim in good stead when he came to try his hand at demonstrating the\r\nmeaning of electricity in mathematical terms.\r\n\r\nJust before this, in 1856, Maxwell, though only twenty-five years of\r\nage, was offered the chair of natural history, which included most of\r\nthe physical sciences, at Marischal College, Aberdeen. With the\r\nattention that his mathematical papers attracted, it is not surprising\r\nthat after four years of teaching experience he was invited to King's\r\nCollege, London. He held his new position for eight years, and then his\r\nhealth required him to retire to his estate in Kirkcudbrightshire. After\r\nthree years of retirement, his English Alma Mater demanded his services,\r\nand the temptation to get back to an academic career was so great that\r\nhe could not resist it. He became, in 1871, Professor of experimental\r\nphysics at Cambridge. To him, more than to anyone else, is due the\r\nmagnificent development of the physical sciences which took place at\r\nCambridge during the last quarter of the nineteenth century.\r\nUnfortunately, he was not destined to live to enjoy the fruits of his\r\nlabor in organizing the scientific side of the university, but it was\r\nunder his direction that the plans of the Cavendish Laboratory were\r\nprepared, and he superintended every step of the progress of the\r\nbuilding. It was under his careful management, too, that the purchase of\r\nthe very valuable collection of apparatus, with which it was equipped by\r\nthe Duke of Devonshire, was made, and Maxwell's work here counts for\r\nmuch in the history of English science.\r\n\r\nHe died in 1879, when only forty-eight years of age, but he had deeply\r\nimpressed himself upon the science of the nineteenth century. For quite\r\none-half of his scant half-century span of life he had occupied a\r\nprominent place in England, and after the age of thirty-five had come to\r\nbe generally recognized as one of the leading physical scientists of the\r\nworld. His career is, as we have said, a striking illustration of how\r\nearly in life a man's real work is likely to come to him, and how little\r\nsuccess in original investigation is dependent on that development of\r\nmind which is supposed to be due only to long years of application to a\r\nparticular branch of study. Manifestly it is the original genius that\r\ncounts for most, and not any training that it receives, except such as\r\ncomes from its own maturing powers. Environment, if unfavorable, does\r\nnot hamper it much, nor keep it from reaching the proper terminus of its\r\ndestiny; and poor health only serves to prevent the exercise of its full\r\npowers, but does not eclipse the manifestation of its capacity.\r\n\r\nClerk Maxwell's important contribution to science was the demonstration\r\nthat electro-magnetic effects travel through space in the form of\r\ntransverse waves similar to those of light and having the same velocity.\r\nWe have become so familiar with the ideas contained in this explanation,\r\nthat they seem almost obvious now. They came, however, as a great\r\nsurprise to Clerk Maxwell's generation, and at first seemed to be merely\r\na theoretic expression of a mathematical formula. Not long afterwards,\r\nhowever, Maxwell's explanation was corroborated by Hertz, who showed\r\nthat these waves were propagated just as waves of light are, and that\r\nthey exhibit the phenomena of reflection, refraction and polarization.\r\nHertz went on from his demonstration of the actuality of Maxwell's\r\nmathematical theory to the demonstration of further electrical waves.\r\nThese Hertzian waves, as they were called, were a startling discovery,\r\nbut remained only a scientific curiosity until they were taken advantage\r\nof for wireless telegraphy, when a new era of applied electrical science\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nHow his success in this was accomplished will be best understood from\r\nProf. Guthrie Tait's account of Maxwell's devotion to electricity as a\r\nlife-work. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"But the great work of his life was devoted to electricity. He\r\n     began by reading with the most profound admiration and attention\r\n     the whole of Faraday's extraordinary self-revelations, and\r\n     proceeded to translate the ideas of that master into the succinct\r\n     and expressive notation of the mathematicians. A considerable part\r\n     of this translation was accomplished during his career as an\r\n     undergraduate in Cambridge. The writer had the opportunity of\r\n     perusing the MS. on Faraday's lines of force, in a form little\r\n     different from the final one, a year before Maxwell took his\r\n     degree. His great object, as it was also the great object of\r\n     Faraday, was to over-turn the idea of action at a distance. The\r\n     splendid researches of Poisson and Gauss had shown how to reduce\r\n     all the phenomena of statical electricity to mere attractions and\r\n     repulsions exerted at a distance by particles of an imponderable on\r\n     one another. Sir W. Thomson had, in 1846, shown that a totally\r\n     different assumption, based upon other analogies, led (by its own\r\n     special mathematical methods) to precisely the same results. He\r\n     treated the resultant electric force at any point as an analogous\r\n     flux of heat from the sources distributed, in the same manner as\r\n     the supposed electric particles. This paper of Thomson's, whose\r\n     ideas Maxwell afterwards developed in an extraordinary manner,\r\n     seems to have given the first hint that there are at least two\r\n     perfectly distinct methods of arriving at the known formulæ of\r\n     statical electricity. The step to magnetic phenomena was\r\n     comparatively simple; but it was otherwise as regards\r\n     electromagnetic phenomena, where current electricity is essentially\r\n     involved. An exceedingly ingenious, but highly artificial, theory\r\n     had been devised by Weber, which was found capable of explaining\r\n     all the phenomena investigated by Ampère as well as the induction\r\n     currents of Faraday. But this was based upon the assumption of a\r\n     distance-action between electric particles, whose intensity\r\n     depended upon their relative motion as well as on their position.\r\n     This was, of course, more repugnant to Maxwell's mind than the\r\n     statical distance-action developed by Poisson. The first paper of\r\n     Maxwell's in which an attempt at an admissible physical theory of\r\n     electromagnetism was made, was communicated to the Royal Society in\r\n     1867. But the theory in a fully developed form, first appeared in\r\n     his great treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873). Availing\r\n     himself of the admirable generalized coördinate system of Lagrange,\r\n     Maxwell has shown how to reduce all electric and magnetic phenomena\r\n     to stresses and motions of a material medium, and as one\r\n     preliminary, but excessively severe, test of the truth of this\r\n     theory has shown that, if the electromagnetic medium be that which\r\n     is required for the explanation of the phenomena of light, the\r\n     velocity of light in vacuo should be numerically the same as the\r\n     ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units. We do not as\r\n     yet certainly know either of these quantities very exactly, but\r\n     the mean values of the best determination of each separately agree\r\n     with one another more closely than do the various values of either.\r\n     There seems to be no longer any possibility of doubt that Maxwell\r\n     has taken the first grand step towards the discovery of the true\r\n     nature of electrical phenomena. Had he done nothing but this, his\r\n     fame would have been secure for all time. But, striking as it is,\r\n     this forms only one small part of the contents of his truly\r\n     marvelous work.\"\r\n\r\nMaxwell's prediction as to the propagation of electric waves has\r\nreceived its full confirmation, as we have said, in the brilliant\r\nexperiments of Hertz, and in the subsequent application of the Hertzian\r\nwaves to wireless telegraphy in our own time. It was not by mere chance\r\nthat this development of Maxwell's thinking came. Hertz himself\r\ndeclared, in the introduction to his collected papers, that he owed the\r\nsuggestion of his work to Faraday and Maxwell, and above all to\r\nMaxwell's speculations as to the nature of electricity and its relations\r\nto light. Hertz said:\r\n\r\n\"The hypothesis that light is an electric phenomenon is thus made highly\r\nprobable. To give a strict proof of this hypothesis would logically\r\nrequire experiments upon light itself. There is an obvious comparison\r\nbetween the experiments and the theory, in connection with which they\r\nwere really undertaken. Since 1861, science has been in possession of a\r\ntheory which Maxwell constructed upon Faraday's views, and which we\r\ntherefore call the Faraday-Maxwell theory. This theory affirms the\r\noccurrence of the class of phenomena here discovered, just as positively\r\nas the remaining electric theories are compelled to deny it. From the\r\noutset, Maxwell's theory excelled all others in its elaboration and in\r\nthe abundance of relations between the various phenomena which it\r\nincluded.\"\r\n\r\nHow much Maxwell's work was appreciated across the channel, may be\r\nrealized from what Poincaré said: \"So sure did the results of his\r\n(Maxwell's) theory appear as worked out for the deepest problems, that a\r\nfeeling of distrust and suspicion is likely to be mingled with our\r\nadmiration for his magnificent work. It is only after prolonged study\r\nand at the cost of many efforts that this feeling is dissipated.\"\r\n\r\nMaxwell's explanation of electricity is that it is a strain or stress in\r\nthe ether, that it is a condition or mode, and not a substance. One\r\ndistinguished foreign contemporary who had read Maxwell's books with the\r\ngreatest interest, declared that he could not be quite satisfied, since\r\nnowhere did he find what a charge of electricity is, though he seemed to\r\nfind satisfactory information with regard to everything else. Maxwell\r\nrealized, however, the limitations of his speculation very well, and\r\nhesitated, above all, to bind his mathematical conclusions to statements\r\nthat might prove eventually only surmises founded on insufficient\r\ninformation from the standpoint of observation. Even when he gave his\r\nexplanation, he did not insist on it as absolute, but, as pointed out by\r\nPoincaré, discussed it only as a possibility. The French scientist said:\r\n\"Maxwell does not give a mechanical explanation of electricity and\r\nmagnetism; he is only concerned to show that such an explanation is\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nMaxwell thoroughly believed in having a hobby as well as his regular\r\nwork, and during the time while he was devoting himself to the\r\nmathematical explanation of electricity he turned for recreation to\r\ncertain problems in physics, in physiology and psychology, relating to\r\ncolor. He worked almost as great a revolution in our knowledge of\r\ncolor-vision as in any other subject that he took up. Principal Garnett\r\nhas condensed so well what Clerk Maxwell accomplished in the matter of\r\ncolor-vision, in his sketch of him in \"The Heroes of Science,\"[33] that\r\nI prefer to quote his explanation. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"It has been stated that Thomas Young propounded a theory of\r\n     color-vision which assumes that there exists three separate color\r\n     sensations, corresponding to red, green and violet, each having\r\n     its own special organs, the excitement of which causes the\r\n     perception of the corresponding color, other colors being due to\r\n     the excitement of two or more of these simple sensations in\r\n     different proportions. Maxwell adopted blue instead of violet for\r\n     the third sensation, and showed that, if a particular red, green,\r\n     and blue were selected and placed at the angular points of an\r\n     equilateral triangle, the colors formed by mixing them being\r\n     arranged as in Young's diagram, all the shades of the spectrum\r\n     would be ranged along the sides of this triangle, the center being\r\n     neutral grey. For the mixing of colored lights, he at first\r\n     employed the color top; but instead of painting circles with\r\n     colored sectors, the angles of which could not be changed, he used\r\n     circular discs of colored paper slit along one radius. Any number\r\n     of such discs can be combined so that each shows a sector at the\r\n     top, and the angle of each sector can be varied at will by sliding\r\n     the corresponding disc between the others. Maxwell used discs of\r\n     two different sizes, the small discs being placed above the larger\r\n     on the same pivot, so that one set forked a central circle and the\r\n     other set a ring surrounding it. He found that, with discs of five\r\n     different colors, of which one might be white and another black, it\r\n     was always possible to combine them so that the inner circle and\r\n     the outer ring exactly matched. From this he showed that there\r\n     could be only three conditions to be satisfied in the eye, for two\r\n     conditions were necessitated by the nature of the top, since the\r\n     smaller sectors must exactly fill the circle and so must the\r\n     larger. Maxwell's experiments, therefore, confirmed, in general,\r\n     Young's theory. They showed, however, that the relative delicacy of\r\n     the several color sensations is different in different eyes, for\r\n     the arrangement which produced an exact match in the case of one\r\n     observer, had to be modified for another; but this difference of\r\n     delicacy proved to be very conspicuous in color-blind persons, for\r\n     in most of the cases of color-blindness examined by Maxwell the red\r\n     sensation was completely absent, so that only two conditions were\r\n     required by color-blind eyes, and a match could therefore always be\r\n     made in such cases with four discs only. Holmgren has since\r\n     discovered cases of color-blindness in which the violet sensation\r\n     is absent. He agrees with Young in making the third sensation\r\n     correspond to violet rather than blue. Maxwell explained the fact\r\n     that persons color-blind to the red divide colors into blues and\r\n     yellows, by the consideration that, although yellow is a complex\r\n     sensation corresponding to a mixture of red and green, yet in\r\n     nature, yellow tints are so much brighter than greens, that they\r\n     excite the green sensation more than green objects themselves can\r\n     do; and hence greens and yellows are called yellow by such\r\n     color-blind persons, though their perception of yellow is really\r\n     the same as perception of green by normal eyes. Later on, by a\r\n     combination of adjustable slits, prisms, and lenses arranged in a\r\n     'color box,' Maxwell succeeded in mixing, in any desired\r\n     proportions, the light from any three portions of the spectrum, so\r\n     that he could deal with pure spectral colors instead of the complex\r\n     combinations of differently colored lights afforded by colored\r\n     papers. From these experiments, it appears that no ray of the solar\r\n     spectrum can affect one color sensation alone, so that there are no\r\n     colors in nature so pure as to correspond to the pure simple\r\n     sensations, and the colors occupying the angular points of\r\n     Maxwell's diagram affect all three color sensations, though they\r\n     influence two of them to a much smaller extent than the third. A\r\n     particular color in the spectrum corresponds to light which,\r\n     according to the undulatory theory, physically consists of waves,\r\n     all of the same period; but it may affect all three of the color\r\n     sensations of a normal eye, though in different proportions. Thus\r\n     yellow-light of a given wave-length affects the red and green\r\n     sensations considerably and the blue (or violet) slightly, and the\r\n     same effect may be produced by various mixtures of red or orange\r\n     and green.\"\r\n\r\nFor his researches on the perception of color, the Royal Society awarded\r\nClerk Maxwell the Rumford Medal in 1860.\r\n\r\nBesides this more or less theoretic work, however, Maxwell made some\r\ninteresting and important discoveries and inventions in optics. For\r\ninstance, he noted the great differences that exist in the eyes of dark\r\nand fair complexions to different colors when the light falls upon the\r\ncenter of the yellow spot, the so-called fovea centralis, or central pit\r\nof the retina. His researches with regard to this led him to the\r\ndiscovery that this portion of the retina is largely lacking in\r\nsensibility to blue light. He was able to demonstrate this by his\r\nexperiment of looking through a glass vessel containing a solution of\r\nchrome alum, when the central portion of the field of vision appears of\r\na light red color for the first second or two. He was also the inventor\r\nof an ingenious optical apparatus, a real image stereoscope. A still\r\nmore important discovery was that of the double refraction which is\r\nproduced for the time in viscous liquids when they are stirred and their\r\nmotion is not as yet stopped. Maxwell showed that Canada balsam, for\r\ninstance, when stirred, acquired a distinct power of double refraction,\r\nwhich it retained so long as the stress in the fluid produced by\r\nstirring remained.\r\n\r\nOther departments of physics were not neglected. For instance, one of\r\nhis greatest investigations was that on the kinetic theory of gases.\r\nGeniuses had been working before him on this line, for, as pointed out\r\nby Professor Tait, this theory owed its origin to Daniel Bernoulli, the\r\ngreatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, and had been developed\r\nby the successful labors of Herapath, Joule and, above all, of Clausius.\r\nThe work of these men put the general accuracy of the theory beyond all\r\ndoubt and led to its very general acceptance, yet the details of it\r\nneeded to be elaborated before it could become definitely scientific.\r\nIts greatest developments are due to Maxwell, and in this field Maxwell\r\nappeared as an experimenter on the laws of gaseous friction as well as a\r\nmathematician. His work with regard to color had showed his ingenuity as\r\nan experimentalist, and this is still further illustrated by his\r\ncarefully arranged experiments on gases. Indeed, his work in this line\r\nmakes it very clear that nothing was too difficult for him, and that\r\nanything that he turned his hand to in the field of science he was sure\r\nto accomplish with eminent success.\r\n\r\nIt was not only his scientific monographs, however, that indicate how\r\ngreat a scientist Clerk Maxwell was, but his text-books, even those of\r\nmore or less elementary character, which he wrote bring out this same\r\nidea. He wrote, for instance, an admirable text-book on the theory of\r\nheat, which went through many editions. Students of the subject, even\r\nthose who were not far advanced, found it clear and easier of study than\r\nmany a less exhaustive work. He also wrote an elementary treatise on\r\nmatter and motion, which has gone through several editions. One might\r\nthink that so small a work would scarcely interest him enough to tempt\r\nhim to put forth his powers at their best, and that at most it would be\r\na conventional condensation of previous knowledge. Prof. Tait, who\r\nsurely must be taken as a good judge in the matter, says that \"even\r\nthis, like his other and larger works, is full of valuable material\r\nworthy of the most attentive perusal not of students alone, but of the\r\nvery foremost scientific men.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristic traits of Maxwell was his desire to impart\r\ninformation to others. This extended not only to his academic relations,\r\nbut, above all, to the working classes, who might have few opportunities\r\nfor the obtaining of the information that was so interesting with\r\nregard to natural subjects. Everywhere that he held an academic post in\r\nhis life, he gave lectures to the workmen. He was an extremely\r\ninteresting talker, and one of his friends said of him: \"I do believe\r\nthere is not a single subject on which he cannot talk, and talk well,\r\ntoo, displaying always the most curious and out-of-the-way information.\"\r\nOne of his private tutors said of him: \"It is not possible for Maxwell\r\nto think incorrectly on physical subjects.\" It is easy to understand,\r\nthen, how much his lectures to the working people at Aberdeen, at\r\nEdinburgh, and at Kings College, London, as well as at Cambridge, meant\r\nfor them. If men like Maxwell would take up the popularization of\r\nscience generally, then there would be much less opprobrium attached to\r\nthe expression popular science than there has been only too often in the\r\npast, and is even at present.\r\n\r\nJust as Maxwell set himself to the solution of the most difficult\r\nproblems in physics, so he did not hesitate to give himself also to the\r\ndiscussion of problems in ethics. Here his power of penetration, the\r\nrigid logic of his mind, and his power to follow out conclusions to\r\ntheir ultimate significance, were quite as manifest as any scientific\r\nwriting. It is almost the rule to find that scientists either ignore the\r\ngreat problems of man's place in nature and his destiny, or treat them\r\nvery superficially. Agnosticism had become the fad of the moment, and\r\nwas just beginning to make itself felt as a fashion in thinking when\r\nClerk Maxwell was doing his great work. Maxwell was not an agnostic in\r\nscience, and because he could not solve all the problems that came to\r\nhim with regard to electricity and the constitution of matter, this did\r\nnot keep him from setting himself to the task of seeing what should be\r\nhis thoughts with regard to these subjects. He had none of the\r\nagnostic's feelings with regard to them, that since we cannot know all\r\nabout them definitely and absolutely, therefore it is not worth while\r\nstudying them at all. Had Maxwell been tempted to any such line of\r\nthought, we would have missed some of the most helpful scientific\r\nspeculations and suggestions that have ever been made.\r\n\r\nNo one knew better than Maxwell, that his speculations on matter and\r\nelectricity were theories, and that what he was offering to science were\r\nnot definite explanations, but possible hypotheses. He has emphasized\r\nthis himself over and over again. This inability of the human intellect\r\nat the present moment to solve all the questions that its inquiring\r\nspirit can evoke, did not keep him from investigating and following up\r\nhis investigations by mathematical deductions and mechanical suggestions\r\njust as far as possible. He had the same attitude of mind toward the\r\ngreat problems of man's relation to his fellow-man, to the universe, and\r\nto a hereafter. While he felt that he could not solve the problems\r\nentirely, he felt also that his reasoning was quite sufficient to enable\r\nhim to get a little nearer to the heart mystery of them and to\r\nunderstand something of their significance. In his later years, the\r\nquestion of the existence of pain and suffering in the world had,\r\nbecause of Darwin's attitude towards them and his declaration that since\r\nhe was unable to understand them they carried him away from the thought\r\nof a beneficent Creator, attracted much attention. We have an essay of\r\nClerk Maxwell's, then, on \"Aspects of Pain,\" in which he discusses\r\nparticularly pain as discipline. It is, of course, the old story, that\r\nmen rise on stepping-stones of their dead selves, and that the\r\nsuccessive deaths of self represent a triumphant progress, but it comes\r\nwith a new vigor from this great scientist. We all know that it is the\r\nman who has suffered who is able to do things, and we are all well aware\r\nthat the man who has lived in comfort all his life is almost sure to be\r\nlacking in character when a great crisis comes upon him. Indeed, as\r\nClerk Maxwell re-states it, this is such a commonplace that one wonders\r\nwhy the problem of pain should have seemed so hard to understand.\r\n\r\nThere is an essay of his, also, on \"Science and Free Will,\" which seems\r\nto deserve special notice. He has no illusions with regard to\r\ndeterminism. He is perfectly sure that he is free and that the great\r\nmajority of men around him do or do not things as they choose. He points\r\nout that science makes for determinism only if one takes a very narrow\r\nview of it. Free will is not only compatible with scientific thinking,\r\nbut it represents what would be expected as a culmination of the\r\nsignificance of life. In a word, Clerk Maxwell wrote as suggestively\r\nwith regard to the great problems of human life as with regard to the\r\nphysical nature around him that claimed so much of his interest. He was\r\na true natural philosopher, and his interests were not limited merely to\r\nthe lower orders of beings.\r\n\r\nBecause of the supreme power of Clerk Maxwell's mind to seek out the\r\nvery heart of difficulties, the conclusions which he reached with regard\r\nto the existence of matter and the causes for the ultimate qualities\r\nwhich it exhibits, have an enduring interest. Mathematics is sometimes\r\nsaid to lead minds into scepticism. Cardinal Newman even thought that\r\nthe mathematical cast of mind was the farthest removed from that which\r\nmight be expected to accept things confidently on faith. Clerk Maxwell's\r\nintellect was eminently mathematical; yet, far from sending him over\r\ninto the camp of the agnostics, his tendency to get at the ultimate\r\nreasons for things seemed almost to push him to conclusions with regard\r\nto the origin of matter, and especially its ultimate constituents, not\r\nordinarily supposed to be scientific. A passage like the following, for\r\ninstance, which may be found in his book on \"The Theory of Heat,\"\r\nLondon, 1872, page 312, brings out this tendency very well:\r\n\r\n\"But if we suppose the molecules to be made at all, or if we suppose\r\nthem to consist of something previously made, why should we expect any\r\nirregularity to exist among them? If they are, as we believe, the only\r\nmaterial things which still remain in the precise condition in which\r\nthey first began to exist, why should we not rather look for some\r\nindication of that spirit of order, our scientific confidence in which\r\nis never shaken by the difficulty which we experience in tracing it in\r\nthe complex arrangements of visible things, and of which our moral\r\nestimation is shown in all our attempts to think and speak the truth,\r\nand to ascertain the exact principles of distributive justice?\"\r\n\r\nThe argument from design for creation is often said in our day to have\r\nlost its weight. For Clerk Maxwell, however, this was evidently not the\r\ncase. On the contrary, he seemed to find in the detailed knowledge of\r\nthe ultimate constituents of matter which had come in recent years,\r\nadditional proofs of the great design which permeates nature. He had\r\ncome to the conclusion that not only were the groups of atoms which make\r\nup living things so ordered as to produce definite results, because\r\nthere was a great purpose and, above all, a great Designer behind\r\nnature, but he also reached the position that the separate atoms of\r\nmatter were so ordered with regard to one another, and in that ordering\r\nwere so closely related to corresponding qualities in higher beings,\r\nthat only the presence of a great design in nature could possibly\r\naccount for all these wonderful attributes, which were to be found even\r\nin the smallest portions of matter. He said in his article on the atom,\r\nin the ninth edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica:\r\n\r\n\"What I thought of was not so much that uniformity of result which is\r\ndue to uniformity in the process of formation, as a uniformity intended\r\nand accomplished by the same wisdom and power of which uniformity,\r\naccuracy, symmetry, consistency, and continuity of plan are as important\r\nattributes as the contrivance of the special utility of each individual\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the old argument for the existence of God, from the design\r\nexhibited in the universe, rehabilitated by its application to the\r\nminutest portions of matter, whose qualities demand such an explanation\r\nquite as much as the highest adaptations of nature.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking expression of all with regard to the atoms\r\nthat Clerk Maxwell permitted himself, is that in which he finds the type\r\nof what is best in man, in every minute portion of the universe, planted\r\nthere by the Creator just as surely as they are in His highest beings,\r\nbecause they represent the most precious qualities of His own nature as\r\nthey are reflected in the creation that He called into existence.\r\n\r\n\"They (the atoms) continue this day as they were created, perfect in\r\nnumber and measure and weight, and from the ineffaceable characters\r\nimpressed on them we may learn that those aspirations, after accuracy in\r\nmeasurement, truth in statement, and justice in action, which we reckon\r\namong our noblest attributes as men, are ours because they are essential\r\nconstituents of the image of Him Who in the beginning created not only\r\nthe heaven and the earth, but the materials of which heaven and earth\r\nconsist.\"\r\n\r\nA very interesting side of Maxwell's life is that which shows his\r\ncontinued interest in literature, and even his occasional dippings into\r\npoetry. Though he reached distinction in mathematics and physics so\r\nearly in his career, he yet found time to indulge a liking for the\r\nclassics, and we even find some rather good translations of Horace's\r\nodes from his pen. The translation of a part of the Ajax of Sophocles\r\nfrom the Greek is a striking testimony to the breadth of Maxwell's\r\nintellectual interests. All during life, however, he permitted himself\r\noccasionally the luxury of fitting words into verse forms, and sometimes\r\nwith a success that deserves much more than passing interest. It is very\r\nprobable that the following verses, for instance, which are the first\r\nand last stanzas of a poem on the formula for being happy in life and\r\nwere meant to be sung (or at least so he would hint) to the tune of \"Il\r\nsegreto per esser felice,\" will strike many a sympathetic chord in the\r\nmodern time.\r\n\r\n    There are some folks that say\r\n    They have found out a way\r\n      To be healthy and wealthy and wise:--\r\n    \"Let your thoughts be but few,\r\n    Do as other folks do,\r\n      And never be caught by surprise.\r\n    Let your motto be follow the fashion,\r\n      But let other people alone;\r\n    Do not love them nor hate them nor care for their fate,\r\n    But keep a lookout for your own.\r\n    Then what though the world may run riot,\r\n      Still playing at catch who catch can,\r\n    You may just eat your dinner in quiet\r\n      And live like a sensible man.\"\r\n\r\n    In Nature I read quite a different creed,\r\n      There everything lives in the rest;\r\n    Each feels the same force\r\n    As it moves in its course,\r\n      And all by one blessing are blest.\r\n    The end that we live for is single,\r\n      But we labor not therefor alone;\r\n    For together we feel how by wheel within wheel\r\n      We are helped by a force not our own.\r\n    So we flee not the world and its dangers,\r\n      For He that has made it is wise;\r\n    He knows we are pilgrims and strangers,\r\n      And He will enlighten our eyes.\r\n\r\nThere probably was not a more nicely logical or more accurately\r\nreasoning intellect among all our nineteenth century scientists than\r\nthat of the great mathematical electrician. He had none of the\r\none-sidedness of the merely experimental scientist, nor, on the other\r\nhand, the narrowness of the exclusively speculative philosopher. With a\r\npower of analysis that was seldom equaled during the century, he had a\r\npower of synthesis that probably surpassed any of his contemporaries in\r\nany part of Europe. His ideas with regard to matter and its ultimate\r\nconstitution are most suggestive. His suggestion of a strain in the\r\nether as an explanation of electricity, thus enabling scientists to get\r\naway from the curious theories of the foretime which had required them\r\nto accept \"action at a distance,\" that is, without any connecting\r\nmedium, shows his power of following out abstruse ideas to definite\r\npractical conclusions. His religious life, then, will be a surprise to\r\nthose who think that science leads men away from religion.\r\n\r\nIn the life of Clerk Maxwell, written by Campbell and Garnett,[31] there\r\nis a passage from his friend and sometime pastor, Guillemard, in which\r\nthe details of his religious life are given so fully as scarcely to\r\nrequire any further gleaning of information in this regard.\r\n\r\n\"He was a constant, regular attendant at church, and seldom, if ever,\r\nfailed to join in our monthly late celebration of Holy Communion, and he\r\nwas a generous contributor to all our parish charitable institutions.\r\nBut his illness drew out the whole heart and soul and spirit of the man;\r\nhis firm and undoubting faith in the Incarnation and all its results; in\r\nthe full sufficing of atonement; in the works of the Holy Spirit. He had\r\ngauged and fathomed all the schemes and systems of philosophy, and had\r\nfound them utterly empty and unsatisfying--'unworkable' was his own word\r\nabout them--and he turned with simple faith to the Gospel of the\r\nSaviour.\"\r\n\r\nHis faith was not disturbed at the near approach of death, but, on the\r\ncontrary, seemed strengthened. His biographers tell the story of some\r\nof the expressions used to his friends during these last days, which\r\nfurnish manifest proof of this. Some of these passages are so\r\ncharacteristic and so striking that they deserve to be in the note-book\r\nof those to whom the modern idea that science is opposed to religion or\r\nfaith may sometimes have been a source of worry, or at least an occasion\r\nfor argument. Here is a typical one of these passages:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Colin Mackenzie has repeated to us two sayings of his during those\r\nlast days, which may be repeated here: 'Old chap, I have read up many\r\nqueer religions; there is nothing like the old thing, after all; and I\r\nhave looked into most philosophical systems, and I have seen that none\r\nwill work without a God.'\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined, because Clerk Maxwell was a deeply religious\r\nman, that, therefore, he was frigid or formal or extremely serious, or\r\ninclined to be puritanic with regard to the pleasures of life, or a\r\nfanatic in the matter of taking all the good-natured fun there might be\r\nin anything that turned up. He was far from over-serious, or what has\r\nbeen called, though not quite properly, ascetic; but, on the contrary,\r\nwas often, indeed usually, the soul of the party with which he was at\r\nthe moment. He had none at all of the self-centered interest of the\r\nnarrow-minded, but had many friends, and was liked by all his\r\nacquaintances. His friends were enthusiastic about his kindness of heart\r\nand the thorough congeniality of his disposition. On this point, the\r\nsketch of him in the National Dictionary of Biography gives a charming\r\npicture:\r\n\r\n\"As a man, Maxwell was loved and honored by all who knew him; to his\r\npupils, he was the kindest and most sympathetic of teachers; to his\r\nfriends, he was the most charming of companions, brimful of fun, the\r\nlife and soul of a Red Lion dinner at the British Association meetings;\r\nbut in due season brave and thoughtful, with keen interest in problems\r\nthat lay outside the domain of his own work, and throughout his life a\r\nstern foe to all that was superficial or untrue. On religious\r\nquestions, his beliefs were strong and deeply rooted.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added to this, that his religion had nothing of the merely\r\nformal about it, nor was it perfunctory. It entered into most of the\r\ndetails of his life, and the fact that, every day as the head of the\r\nhouse he led evening prayers for the family, was only a token of the\r\ndeep hold which religion had upon his life. When his last illness came,\r\nthough he knew that his end was not far off, and at his age sometimes\r\nthe approach of death hampers religious faith because it does seem that\r\nlonger life might be afforded to one who has been so faithful in his\r\nrealization of the obligations of life, Clerk Maxwell's piety increased\r\nrather than diminished. A favorite expression of his during his last\r\ndays was the verselet from Richard Baxter, which one would be apt to\r\nthink of as frequently repeated by some feminine devotee rather than by\r\nthe greatest mathematical scientist of the nineteenth century:\r\n\r\n    \"Lord, it belongs not to my care,\r\n      Whether I die or live;\r\n    To love and serve Thee is my share,\r\n      And that Thy grace must give.\"\r\n\r\nA friend who knew him intimately says: \"In private life, Clerk Maxwell\r\nwas one of the most lovable of men, a sincere and unostentatious\r\nChristian. Though perfectly free from any trace of envy or ill-will, he\r\nyet showed on fit occasions his contempt for that pseudo-science which\r\nseeks for the applause of the ignorant by professing to reduce the whole\r\nsystem of the universe to a fortuitous sequence of uncaused events.\"\r\n\r\nIn these phases of his intellectual life, the greatest of the\r\nmathematical electricians of the nineteenth century deserves to be taken\r\nas the type of the man of science, rather than the many mediocre\r\nintelligences whose minds were not large enough apparently for the two\r\nsets of truths--those of the moral as well as of the physical order.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: LORD KELVIN]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] See life of Johann Müller, in Makers of Modern Medicine,\r\nFordham University Press, N.

London,\r\n1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLORD KELVIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew men lived to witness so many remarkable discoveries in science and\r\nso many applications of the same to the welfare of the race as did the\r\nman whose name stands at the head of this chapter. When William Thomson,\r\nthe future Lord Kelvin, first saw the light of day, the voltaic pile was\r\nin a rudimentary and inefficient form. It is true that water had been\r\ndecomposed by the current from a pile in 1800,[37] that the magnetic\r\neffect of the current had been discovered in 1820, and the possibility\r\nof a practical form of an electric telegraph suggested in the same year;\r\nbut Ohm's law was still one of nature's secrets, electromagnetic\r\ninduction was undiscovered, and the doctrine of energy but ill\r\nunderstood. Light, electricity and magnetism were regarded as distinct\r\nforces, and heat was thought to be a material substance, to which the\r\nname caloric was assigned. What Young, Fresnel and Ampère were in the\r\nearly years of the nineteenth century; what Faraday, Regnault and\r\nJoseph Henry were some time later, Kelvin became in the 'fifties, a\r\nleader in the intellectual and scientific life of the time, a leader\r\ndestined to extend the frontiers of knowledge, to establish an accurate\r\nsystem of electrical measurement, and to enrich the world with\r\ninstruments of marvelous ingenuity and precision.\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomson, born in Belfast in 1824, received his early training in\r\nthe Royal Academic Institute of that city. When eight years of age, he\r\nleft his native land, exchanging the shores of Antrim for the banks of\r\nthe Clyde. His father, James Thomson, a mathematician of note, having\r\nbeen appointed to the chair of mathematics in the University of Glasgow\r\n(founded in 1451), proceeded early in the summer of 1832 to the\r\ncommercial metropolis of Scotland, accompanied by his two sons William\r\nand James, both of whom were destined to add lustre to the family name.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of preparatory study, the two brothers, who were ten and\r\neleven years of age, respectively, matriculated at the university. With\r\nthe iron-clad regulations that govern admission to American colleges and\r\nuniversities, these boys would at best have been admitted to one of our\r\nhigh schools, and kept there until they reached the maturity required by\r\nthe age limit. By the time young William attained that limit, he had\r\nalready finished his work at the university, and captured the first\r\nprizes in mathematics, astronomy and natural philosophy. He was then\r\nonly sixteen years of age, small of stature, but a giant in intellect;\r\nbrilliant, versatile, and with a passion for work. It was his good\r\nfortune, also, to come under the influence of a great teacher, in the\r\nperson of Prof. Nichol. \"I have to thank what I heard in the natural\r\nphilosophy class,\" he said in 1903, \"for all I did in connection with\r\nsubmarine cables. The knowledge of Fourier was my start in the theory of\r\nsignaling through submarine cables, which occupied a large part of my\r\nafter-life. The inspiring character of Dr. Nichol's personality and his\r\nbright enthusiasm live still in my mental picture of those old days.\"\r\n\r\nHaving heard Fourier's treatise on the mathematical theory of heat\r\nspoken of one day as a remarkable and inspiring work, young Thomson\r\nastonished the Professor when, at the end of the lecture, he addressed\r\nDr. Nichol with the query, \"Do you think that I could read it?\" To which\r\nthe Professor smilingly replied: \"Well, the mathematical part is very\r\ndifficult.\" Many a student would have left Fourier alone for the nonce,\r\nafter listening to a statement so little calculated to excite courage or\r\nawaken interest: but Thomson was not an ordinary student; and, however\r\nforbidding the answer which he received, he was determined all the same\r\nto handle the volume and seek its inspiration. Without delay, he got the\r\nbook from the university library, and grew so delighted with the new\r\nideas of the French mathematician about sine-expansions and\r\ncosine-expansions, that in the space of two weeks he had \"turned over\r\nall the pages\" of the book, as he modestly put it.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1840, he accompanied his father and his brother on a\r\ntour through Germany, partly to see the country and partly also, to\r\nacquire a practical knowledge of the language. In both these objects, he\r\nwas somewhat hindered by his fondness for mathematical studies, which\r\nled him to include in his impedimenta for the trip a copy of Fourier's\r\n_Théorie analytique de la Chaleur_. Most students out on a summer's\r\nvacation, especially in foreign parts, would doubtless have preferred to\r\ngive their minds rest and congenial distraction rather than keep on\r\nreading and pondering over abstract mathematical concepts. Our young\r\ntourist, on the other hand, seems to have thought of little else than of\r\nFourier's \"mathematical poem,\" as Clerk Maxwell called the work, a\r\n\"poem\" that continued to have a charm for him all through life. It is a\r\nnoteworthy fact that Thomson continually returned to the ideas and\r\nmethods of this suggestive treatise on the flow of heat, and that he\r\napplied them with great success to problems in thermal conductivity, in\r\nelectricity and in submarine telegraphy.\r\n\r\nShortly after returning home, Thomson was sent to the University of\r\nCambridge, where he entered St. Peter's College, commonly called\r\nPeterhouse, one of the oldest colleges of the university, its foundation\r\ndating back to the year 1284. Though he, no doubt, followed in a general\r\nway the directions given him by William Hopkins, \"the best of private\r\ntutors,\" and kept in view the requirements of the honors examination,\r\ncalled the \"Mathematical Tripos,\" for which he intended to present\r\nhimself at the end of his course, he found his studies somewhat routinal\r\nand uninspiring. Original work was more to his taste than conventional\r\nsubjects; his tutor, however, thought mainly of placing this brilliant\r\npupil at the head of the wranglers, and hailing him the senior wrangler\r\nof the year, for which purpose, the beaten track must be followed, the\r\nstandard works read, favorite problems worked out, short-cuts conned and\r\nrapidity of output exercised. Stokes, of Pembroke, had been senior\r\nwrangler in 1841; Cayley, of Trinity, in 1842; and Adams, of John's, in\r\n1843; why not Thomson, of Peterhouse, in 1845, argued Hopkins, who had\r\nthe distinction of being second wrangler of the previous year?\r\n\r\nBut when the ordeal was over and the work of all candidates appraised,\r\nThomson's name was second on the list, with Parkinson, of John's, at the\r\ntop. Hopkins was disappointed, as he had a right to be, for it was\r\nthought by many and said by some that Parkinson was not fit to sharpen\r\nThomson's pencils. At the examination for the Smith's prizes, which\r\nimmediately followed, and which was generally regarded as a higher honor\r\nand a better test of original ability, the order was reversed, and\r\nThomson's star blazed out with the brilliancy of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe have here an instructive instance of the failure of an examination to\r\nplace rightly the most gifted man; that of Sylvester, in 1837, and Clerk\r\nMaxwell, in 1854, both of whom were second wranglers, are equally so.\r\nExaminations, however, seldom fail in justly rating candidates when\r\noriginality is not a necessary qualification, but only a sound knowledge\r\nand liberal interpretation of the subjects laid down in the syllabus; a\r\ngood memory and rapidity of writing will do the rest.\r\n\r\nThomson committed the fatal mistake in the tripos examination of\r\ndevoting too much time to a particular question in which he was deeply\r\ninterested. It was a curious coincidence that the solution which\r\nParkinson sent in to the same question was almost identical with that of\r\nhis rival for mathematical honors. On being questioned about the matter\r\nby the Moderators, Parkinson said that he had read the solution some\r\ntime before in the _Cambridge Mathematical Journal_; Thomson's\r\nexplanation was that the solution given in the Journal was his! As he\r\nhad not memorized the details, he was obliged of course to work the\r\nproblem out _de novo_.\r\n\r\nParkinson in later years wrote a treatise on elementary mechanics that\r\nhas long since made way for others; Thomson, on the other hand,\r\npublished in collaboration with Tait a _Treatise on Natural Philosophy_\r\nfor advanced students, which became at once the accepted standard.\r\nThroughout this treatise, the view is emphasized that physics deals with\r\nrealities more than with theories, with mutual relations more than with\r\ntheir mathematical expression. Helmholtz thought so highly of this work\r\nthat he translated it into German, saying in his preface: \"William\r\nThomson, one of the most penetrating and ingenious thinkers, deserves\r\nthe thanks of the scientific world, in that he takes us into the\r\nworkshop of his thoughts and unravels the guiding threads which have\r\nhelped him to master and set in order the most resisting and confused\r\nmaterial.\" And again: \"Following the example given by Faraday, he avoids\r\nas far as possible hypotheses about unknown subjects, and endeavors to\r\nexpress by his mathematical treatment of problems simply the law of\r\nobservable phenomena.\"\r\n\r\nWe are not to think of Thomson, the undergraduate, as of one who gave\r\nhimself up, mind and body, to his favorite studies; he knew how to\r\ncombine, in some measure, the _dulce_ with the _utile_, for he was fond\r\nof music, and so proficient in the art that he was elected President of\r\nthe Musical Society. He also took a practical interest in aquatic\r\nsports, and on the Cam he could ply his sculls with the best of the men.\r\nIndeed, he was fond of the water all through life, his _Lalla Rookh_\r\nbeing well known on the Clyde and in the Solent. Expert in the\r\nnavigation of his yacht, he liked to be out on the deep, caressed by\r\nwind and buffeted by wave, on which occasions he usually studied, pencil\r\nin hand, problems connected with navigation and hydrodynamics.\r\n\r\nThomson was never without his note-book. Even in his journeys to London,\r\nwhen he usually took the night train to save time, his mind was active,\r\nand the green-book was in frequent requisition to receive thoughts that\r\noccurred relative to problems that engaged his attention. Unlike many\r\nmortals, he was able to sleep soundly on those night trips, although in\r\nthe early days he had none of the luxuries of traveling which we\r\nconsider indispensable to our comfort.\r\n\r\nHelmholtz records that, being on the _Lalla Rookh_ on one occasion,\r\nThomson \"carried the freedom of intercourse so far that he always had a\r\nmathematical note-book with him; and as soon as an idea occurred to him,\r\nhe began to reckon right in the midst of company.\" This reminds us of\r\nthe answer which Newton gave to a friend who asked him how he\r\naccomplished so much. \"By constantly thinking of it,\" was the brief\r\nreply. Concentration of the faculties is necessary for all good work; a\r\ndistracted mind never achieved anything of value in philosophy, in\r\nscience, in religious worship. Concentration is like a convex lens,\r\nwhich brings rays to a focus; whereas distraction is like a concave\r\nlens, which breaks them up into a number of divergent and scattered\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Cambridge in 1845, Thomson proceeded to London, and was\r\nwarmly received by Faraday, then of world-wide reputation. He next went\r\nto Paris, where, in the laboratory of Regnault, he devoted himself to\r\noriginal research, under the direction of that great and accurate\r\nphysicist who was then carrying out his classic work on the thermal\r\nconstants of bodies.\r\n\r\nThe year 1846 marks an epoch in Thomson's life; for, in that year, he\r\nwas chosen to succeed Nichol, his friend and master, in the chair of\r\nnatural philosophy in the University of Glasgow. Though only in his\r\ntwenty-second year, he chose for the subject of his inaugural address\r\nthe age of the earth, a subject which continued to have a life-long\r\ninterest for him because of its very fascination, and perhaps, too,\r\nbecause of the opposition which his views aroused on the part of\r\nbiologists and geologists. These demanded untold æons for the original\r\nfire-mist to cool down and form a spinning globe fit to be the abode of\r\norganic life, whereas Thomson endeavored to show the weakness of the\r\narguments which they advanced to uphold their claim for unlimited time.\r\nBasing his estimate on the rate of increase of temperature as we go\r\nbelow the earth's surface, he concluded that the earth required from 100\r\nto 200 million years, and probably less, to cool from its molten state\r\nto its present condition.\r\n\r\nImpressed by the value of the experimental work which he did under\r\nRegnault in Paris, Prof. Thomson gave himself no rest until he secured a\r\nplace in which the demonstrations of the lecture-room could be\r\nsupplemented by qualitative and quantitative work in the laboratory.\r\nThis was the first \"physical laboratory\" open to students in Great\r\nBritain, a fact that makes the year 1846 a memorable one in the history\r\nof university development. Two apartments were allotted him for\r\nexperimental purposes, _viz._, an abandoned wine-cellar and a disused\r\nexamination-room, to which, as time went on, were added a corridor, some\r\nspare attics, and even the university tower itself, so great was the\r\npower of annexation possessed by the young Professor. In those dark and\r\ncheerless rooms, a few old instruments were installed, after which\r\nstudents were invited and work begun. A band of men, whose ardor was\r\nenkindled by the glowing enthusiasm of the presiding genius, gathered\r\naround him, and helped him to carry out investigations on the properties\r\nof metals, on moduli of elasticity, elastic fatigue and atmospheric\r\nelectricity. Among this band of earnest students it will suffice to\r\nmention the names of the late Prof. Ayrton, an eminent electrician;\r\nProf. John Perry, known for his Homeric battles in favor of reform in\r\nthe teaching of mathematics; Sir William Ramsay, the discoverer of the\r\n\"newer\" gases of the atmosphere; and Prof. Andrew Gray, who succeeded\r\nhis master in the University of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nWriting of his laboratory experiences, Prof. Ramsay says: \"I remember\r\nthat my first exercise, which occupied over a week, was to take the\r\nkinks out of a bundle of copper wire. Having achieved this with some\r\nsuccess, I was placed opposite a quadrant electrometer and made to study\r\nits construction and use.\" \"Although this method,\" he adds, \"is not\r\nwithout its disadvantages--for systematic instruction is of much\r\nvalue--there is something to be said for it. On the one hand, too long a\r\ncourse of experimenting on old and well known lines is likely to imbue\r\nthe young student with the idea that all physics consists in learning\r\nthe use of apparatus and repeating measurements which have already been\r\nmade. On the other hand, too early attempts to investigate the unknown\r\nare likely to prove fruitless for want of manipulative skill and for\r\nwant of knowledge of what has already been done.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Gray wrote: \"In the physical laboratory, Prof. Thomson was both\r\ninspiring and distracting. He continually thought of new things to be\r\ntried, and interrupted the course of work with interpolated experiments\r\nwhich often robbed the previous sequence of operations of their final\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nIt may bring a grain of consolation to teachers who meet with\r\ntroublesome elements in the discharge of their duties, to know that\r\nThomson, great and brilliant as he was, had similar experiences now and\r\nagain. At one time a book of mathematical data would be removed from the\r\nplace assigned to it, upon which he would give orders that it should be\r\nchained to the table; at others, there would be no chalk near the\r\nblackboard, and then the assistant would be solemnly instructed to have\r\none hundred pieces available next time. On one occasion, he settled in a\r\nvery novel manner the case of a student who insisted on disturbing the\r\nclass by moving his foot back and forth on the floor. Calling his\r\nassistant, Thomson told him in a whisper to go down into the room under\r\nthe tiers of seats, to listen attentively, and locate the wandering foot\r\nby its distance from two adjacent walls of the building. On his return\r\nto the lecture-room, the triumphant assistant gave the desired\r\ncoordinates to the Professor, who took out his tape at once and measured\r\noff the distances, by which the outwitted offender was mathematically\r\nlocated. In obedience to orders, the latter rose and left the room,\r\nmuttering a few graceful epithets as he went, in honor of Descartes, the\r\nfounder of a system of geometry that could serve so well the twofold\r\npurpose of the detective and the mathematician.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in Glasgow to open the daily sessions, morning and\r\nafternoon, with prayer, the selection of which was left to the\r\ndiscretion of the Professor. Thomson usually recited from memory the\r\nthird collect from the morning service of the Church of England, to\r\nwhich he sometimes added reflections of his own for the spiritual\r\nbenefit of his hearers.\r\n\r\nIn his teaching, Prof. Thomson was particularly insistent that his\r\nstudents should not bow their intellects in mute admiration before an\r\narray of mathematical symbols; but that, on all occasions, they should\r\nseek the physical meaning behind them. Writing on his blackboard one\r\nday _dx/dt_, he was not satisfied when told that it represented the\r\nratio of the increment of _x_ to the increment of the independent\r\nvariable _t_ (time); he wanted the student to say it represents\r\nvelocity. He himself was so wont to look for the physical meaning of\r\nsymbols that, like the prophets of old, he saw many things that were\r\nhidden from the eyes of ordinary mortals.\r\n\r\nHe had the rare gift of translating mathematical equations into real\r\nfacts; and he strove all throughout his life, by word and writing, to\r\npurify mathematical theory from mere assumptions. He often said that he\r\ncould not understand a thing until he was able to make, or at least\r\nconceive, a model of it.\r\n\r\nHe had a \"keen mathematical instinct,\" as Prof. Silvanus P. Thomson puts\r\nit in a letter to the writer, an insight that \"grew to see things.\" He\r\noften left matters in the dark for years, then returned to see them in\r\nthe clear light of truth. At the age of sixteen, he wrote a mathematical\r\nessay on the figure of the earth; and at eighty-three, took it up again\r\nin order to add a note to the argument!\r\n\r\nThomson was discursive in his lectures, and was never able to boil the\r\nmatter down to suit the taste and digestive powers of the ordinary\r\nstudent. The activity of his mind and its fecundity were such that new\r\nideas, new problems, new modes of treatment were continually occurring,\r\nand with such fascination that he would leave the main subject to\r\nindulge in what often proved prolonged digressions. One of his bugbears\r\nwas our system of weights and measures, which he denounced in season\r\nand out of season as \"insane,\" \"brain-wasting\" and \"dangerous.\"\r\nOccasionally epithets of a more caloric nature would escape the lips of\r\nthe indignant Professor, who, as a consequence of his denunciation, had\r\nalways to be indulgent to students who chanced to be shaky in the matter\r\nof Troy weight, avoirdupois weight or even apothecaries weight.\r\n\r\nIn later years, I heard Lord Kelvin at the Royal Institution, London, on\r\nsome of his favorite dynamical subjects, such as the gyrostat, vortex\r\nrings and the like. However impressed by his keen eye, intellectual\r\nforehead, his mastery of the subject and wealth of illustration, I was\r\nno less impressed by his vivacity, his enthusiasm and the rapidity with\r\nwhich he could leave a train of thought and return to it again.\r\n\r\nAt meetings of the British Association, he always had something\r\nilluminating to say; but not infrequently, carried away by a torrent of\r\nideas, he would indulge in a superfluity of detail, forgetting that\r\nother speakers had to be heard and other papers read.\r\n\r\nThe idea of connecting the Old World with the New by means of an\r\nelectric cable laid on the bed of the ocean, seemed to most people in\r\nthe 'fifties quixotic and utopian. Manufacturers said such a cable could\r\nnot be made; engineers, that it could not be laid; electricians, that it\r\ncould not be worked; and financiers, that if laid and worked, it would\r\nnever pay. But with a Field to look after the financial interests of the\r\nscheme, and a Thomson to attend to electrical quantities, there was no\r\ntilting at windmills, and the utopian scheme became in due time the\r\ncable whose core pulsated with the news of the world.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1850, Bishop Mullock, of St. John's, N. F., addressed to an\r\nAmerican newspaper, called the _Courier_, a letter in which he advocated\r\na telegraph line from Newfoundland to New York, so that the news of mail\r\nsteamers could be intercepted and wired to that City. In 1852, the\r\n\"Newfoundland Electric Telegraph Company\" was formed for the purpose of\r\ncarrying out a similar plan. This was to be accomplished by means of a\r\ntelegraph line from Cape Race, at the eastern extremity of Newfoundland\r\nto Cape Ray, on the western, as well as by short cables over to Cape\r\nBreton Island, to Prince Edward Island and the mainland, and thence by\r\nordinary telegraph lines to Canada and the United States. But owing to\r\nthe want of money, nothing was done.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at laying a cable under the Atlantic was made by the\r\nAtlantic Telegraph Company in 1857, after a careful survey of the ocean\r\nhad revealed the existence of a submarine plain, or extended table-land,\r\non which the cable could rest undisturbed by passing keels, monsters of\r\nthe deep or angry billows. The result was the first of a series of\r\nfailures, which caused great perplexity and depression at the time; for,\r\nafter 330 miles had been paid out from Valentia on the Irish coast, the\r\ncable suddenly parted, burying in 2000 fathoms of water an electrical\r\nconductor which had cost $150,000 for its manufacture.\r\n\r\nA second attempt was made in 1858, when the U. S. frigate _Niagara_ and\r\nH. M. S. _Agamemnon_, each carrying half of the cable, met in mid-ocean;\r\nand, after splicing the two ends together, steamed away in opposite\r\ndirections, the _Niagara_ toward Newfoundland and the _Agamemnon_ toward\r\nValentia. Fortunately for the enterprise, Prof. Thomson was on board the\r\nEnglish ship as chief electrician. No doubt, his mind turned many a\r\ntime during those anxious days to Fourier's differential equation for\r\nthe flow of heat along a conductor, and his own application of it to the\r\nconduction of the electric current through the copper core of the cable\r\nas it came up from the tanks, trailed out behind the ship, dipped\r\nsilently into the blue water and slowly settled down to its bed of ooze\r\non the ocean floor.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of disheartening mishaps, necessitating as many returns\r\nof the ships to the rendezvous in mid-ocean, the _Agamemnon_ landed the\r\nshore-end safely in Valentia; and the _Niagara_, after rolling and\r\npitching for days and nights in tempestuous seas, landed hers in Trinity\r\nBay on the morning of August 5th, 1858, on which historic date the\r\ntelegraphic union of the two worlds was finally consummated and the\r\ngreat feat of the century accomplished.\r\n\r\nThough not fully realized at the time by the capitalists who financed\r\nhis scheme, by the engineers and electricians who carried it out, or\r\neven by statesmen, economists and social reformers, the slender copper\r\ncord, buried away from human ken amidst the _débris_ of minute\r\norganisms, was destined to effect a revolution in the affairs of men\r\ngreater than any achieved by the wisdom of sages or the policy of\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nOwing to the electrostatic capacity of the cable, signaling would have\r\nbeen difficult and unsatisfactory had it not been for the\r\nresourcefulness of Prof. Thomson, who devised his reflecting\r\ngalvanometer to serve as receiving instrument. The principle of the\r\nmirror applied in this way was not new, for it had been suggested by\r\nPoggendorff and even used by Gauss in connection with very heavy\r\nmagnets. The magnets used by Thomson, on the other hand, were strips of\r\nwatch-spring weighing about a grain each, so that even a very weak\r\ncurrent coming through the cable would be sufficient to produce strong\r\ndisplacements of the spot of light on the scale. Thomson was clearly the\r\nfirst to insist on small dimensions in magnetic instruments, and to show\r\nthat reduction in size would be attended with corresponding increase in\r\nsensitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe mirror galvanometer, surrounded with a thick iron case to screen it\r\nfrom the magnetic field due to the iron of the ship, the \"iron-clad\r\ngalvanometer\" as it was called, was used for the first time on the\r\ntelegraphic expedition of 1858.\r\n\r\nThe instrument itself, which was fitted up on board the _Niagara_ and\r\nwhich was connected with so many episodes of thrilling interest, was\r\nplaced by Prof. Thomson in the collection of historical apparatus in the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, where it is at the present day.\r\n\r\nBeautiful as was the invention of the mirror galvanometer, it gave\r\nneither warning of the beginning of a message nor a permanent record of\r\nit. Sitting in his dark room, the operator had to be always on the alert\r\nfor the first swing of the spot of light over the scale. To obviate\r\nthese drawbacks, Thomson, after some thinking and more talking with his\r\nfriend White, of Glasgow, finally patented the _siphon-recorder_, in\r\nwhich a glass siphon of capillary dimensions is pulled to the right or\r\nleft by the action of the current flowing through a light movable coil,\r\nand is thus made to register signals in ink on a vertical strip of paper\r\nwhich is kept in uniform motion by a train of clockwork. It is by this\r\nsimple but very ingenious instrument that messages are received and\r\nrecorded to-day at all the cable-stations of the world.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural message through the cable came from the Directors of the\r\nAtlantic Telegraph Company in Great Britain to the Directors in America,\r\nsaying: \"Europe and America are united by telegraph; glory to God in the\r\nhighest, on earth peace and good will toward men.\"\r\n\r\nThe message from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan, consisting of 95\r\nwords, took 67 minutes in transmission; it read:\r\n\r\n\"The Queen desires to congratulate the President upon the successful\r\ncompletion of this great international work, in which the Queen has\r\ntaken the deepest interest.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen is convinced that the President will join with her in\r\nfervently hoping that the electric cable which now connects Great\r\nBritain with the United States will prove an additional link between the\r\nnations whose friendship is founded upon their common interests and\r\nreciprocal esteem.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen has much pleasure in thus communicating with the President,\r\nand renewing to him her wishes for the prosperity of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of President Buchanan was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The President cordially reciprocates the congratulations of Her\r\nMajesty, the Queen, on the success of the great international enterprise\r\naccomplished by the science, skill and indomitable energy of the two\r\ncountries. It is a triumph more glorious, because far more useful to\r\nmankind, than was ever won by conqueror on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n\"May the Atlantic telegraph, under the blessing of Heaven, prove to be a\r\nbond of perpetual peace and friendship between the kindred nations, and\r\nan instrument destined by Divine Providence to diffuse religion,\r\ncivilization, liberty and law throughout the world. In this view will\r\nnot all nations of Christendom spontaneously unite in the declaration\r\nthat it shall be forever neutral, and that its communications shall be\r\nheld sacred in passing to their places of destination, even in the midst\r\nof hostilities?\"\r\n\r\nThe historian of the enterprise was Mr. John Mullaly, of New York, who\r\nwas on the _Niagara_ as secretary to Prof. Morse and subsequently to Mr.\r\nCyrus W. Field and correspondent of the _New York Herald_. He has\r\npublished three interesting works on the subject: a _Trip to\r\nNewfoundland, with an account of the laying of the submarine Cable_\r\n(between Port au Basque and North Sydney), 1855; _The Ocean Telegraph_,\r\n1858; and _The first Atlantic Telegraph Cable_, a pamphlet of 28 pages,\r\nreprinted from the \"Journal of the Franklin Institute,\" 1907. From it,\r\nwe learn that Archbishop Hughes was one of the principal American\r\nsubscribers to the capital of the Atlantic Cable Company.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1855, the subject of laying a cable under the Atlantic ocean\r\nbegan to be seriously considered, Thomson, who was then only 31 years of\r\nage, discussed in a series of masterly papers the theory of signaling\r\nthrough such conductors, showing _inter alia_ that the instruments used\r\non land-lines would be inoperative on cables, and also that the same\r\nspeed of transmission could not be attained on cables as on ordinary\r\ntelegraph lines. It was shown at the same time, that these differences\r\nare due to the fact that, unlike an air-line, the cable is an\r\nelectrical _condenser_ in which the copper core is separated from the\r\nwaters of the ocean by a layer of gutta percha, a nonconducting\r\nmaterial. As a submerged cable is, therefore, a long Leyden jar of great\r\nelectrical capacity, it follows that a signal sent in at the American\r\nend will not reach the other instantly; for while the current flows\r\nalong the conductor, it has also to charge up the cable as it\r\nprogresses, which operation retards the signals, and also deprives them\r\nof the clearness and sharpness with which they were sent. The phenomenon\r\nis analogous to the diffusion of heat along a bar, the temperature of\r\nthe various cross-sections rising in gradual succession until the\r\ndistant end is reached. The mathematical investigations of Thomson\r\nshowed the necessity of working slowly, and of using weak currents as\r\nwell as very delicate receiving instruments. The interval of time\r\nrequired for the transmission of a signal from Newfoundland to Valentia\r\nis about one second.\r\n\r\nSome years later, in 1858, Thomson had the opportunity of putting his\r\ntheoretical views to the test of experiment on a grand, commercial\r\nscale, and had the satisfaction of finding that all his conclusions were\r\nconfirmed. Electricians of the early period distrusted the inexperienced\r\nyoung man who had never erected a mile of telegraph line or even served\r\nfor a month in a telegraph office; but their distrust was followed by\r\nadmiration when they saw the efficient manner in which he handled every\r\nproblem and dealt with every difficulty that occurred while laying the\r\ncable of 1858. It was generally admitted that, had it not been for the\r\nbrilliant work of the young Glasgow Professor, many years would have\r\npassed away before the Old World and the New would have been brought\r\ninto telegraphic communication.\r\n\r\nLike all interested in the enterprise, Thomson was greatly shocked when\r\nthe news reached him that signals could no longer be transmitted through\r\nthe cable, which, after costing so much money, so much thought and\r\nlabor, now lay a useless thing in two and a half miles of water.\r\nAttempts were made to raise it, but without success.\r\n\r\nDuring its short life of less than a month, 366 messages were flashed\r\nthrough the cable, aggregating 4359 words of 21,421 letters.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the pioneer cable has been attributed to a variety of\r\ncauses, chief of which were defective construction and imperfect\r\npaying-out machinery, which produced unequal strains in the cable.\r\nDefective as the cable was at the moment of immersion, the various\r\ntroubles became intensified with time, until at last, when provoked by\r\nthe feebleness of the signals, the injudicious electrician at Valentia\r\nhad recourse to the great penetrative power of the induction coil, and\r\ngave the dying cable the _coup de grâce_.\r\n\r\nAn experiment made by Mr. Latimer Clark is not only germane to the\r\nsubject, but is also of very great interest. Writing from Valentia on\r\nSept. 12th, 1866, Mr. Latimer Clark says: \"With a single galvanic cell,\r\ncomposed of a few drops of acid in a _silver thimble_[36] and a fragment\r\nof zinc, weighing a grain or two, conversation may easily, though\r\nslowly, be carried on through one of the cables (1865, 1866) or through\r\nthe two joined together at Newfoundland; and although in the latter\r\ncase, the spark, twice traversing the breadth of the Atlantic, has to\r\npass through 3700 miles of cable, its effects at the receiving end are\r\nvisible in the galvanometer in a little more than a second after contact\r\nis made with the battery. The deflections are not of a dubious\r\ncharacter, but full and long, the spot of light traversing freely a\r\nspace of 12 in. or 13 in. on the scale; and it is manifest that a\r\nbattery many times smaller would suffice to produce similar effects.\"\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by the English electrician, Mr. William Dickerson\r\ndevised the gun-cap cell, which he used in 1866 with success in\r\ntransmitting signals from Heart's Content, Newfoundland, to Valentia on\r\nthe Irish coast.\r\n\r\nA piece of No. 16 bare copper wire was procured, one end of which was\r\nfirmly twisted around the head of an empty _percussion-cap_. To one end\r\nof another similar length of wire was bound, with fine copper wire, a\r\nshort strip of zinc bent at a right angle to form the anode element of\r\nthe diminutive cell. After charging the cell with a drop of acidulated\r\nwater of the size of an ordinary well-formed tear, and properly\r\nconnecting the terminals with earth and cable, signals were transmitted\r\nover the cable by the infinitesimal current generated by this novel\r\ncell. The receiving operator reported that the signals were \"awfully\r\nsmall\"; but they were intelligible, and messages were successfully\r\ntransmitted under the ocean by this tiny element.\r\n\r\nContrast with this Lilliputian cell the enormous power that was used on\r\nthe cable of 1858 toward the end of its short existence, when batteries\r\nof 380 and 420 Daniell cells were employed to force signals across.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1865, it was decided to make another attempt at laying a cable\r\nunder the Atlantic, Prof. Thomson, whose reputation was enhanced during\r\nthe seven intervening years by a number of communications on the theory\r\nand practice of submarine telegraphy, was again retained as scientific\r\nexpert in a consultative sense, with Mr. Cromwell F. Varley as chief\r\nelectrician. In accordance with the costly experience that had been\r\ngained, a new cable was made and coiled on board the _Great\r\nEastern_,[35] a leviathan which was well fitted for the work by the\r\ngreat man[oe]uvring power afforded by its screw and paddles combined.\r\nLeaving Valentia, the big ship steamed with her prow to the west at a\r\nslow rate of speed, in order to give the cable time to sink beneath the\r\nwaves and adapt itself to the configuration of the ocean floor. Eleven\r\nhundred miles had been successfully paid out when, to the consternation\r\nof all, the cable suddenly snapped and disappeared in more than two\r\nmiles of water. Attempts were made during the next nine days to recover\r\nit from those abysmal depths; and, though grappled many times during\r\nthose trying hours, it gave way each time under the strain to which it\r\nwas subjected. Like its predecessors of 1857 and 1858, the cable of 1865\r\nwas finally abandoned to its fate, and the _Great Eastern_ returned home\r\nwith three greatly disappointed men on board, _viz._, Prof. Thomson, Mr.\r\nC. F. Varley and Captain (later Sir James) Anderson.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, a sum of three-quarters of a million sterling,\r\nnearly $4,000,000, was offered to the Directors of the \"Telegraph\r\nConstruction Company\" if they would complete the cable of 1865 and lay a\r\nnew one. After consultation and careful consideration, the offer was\r\naccepted and the cable constructed according to the best engineering\r\nknowledge available.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Prof. Thomson was again on board the _Great Eastern_ with\r\nCaptain Anderson; and this time the big ship had snugly coiled up in her\r\ndeep, cavernous tanks _the_ cable that was destined to put Europe and\r\nAmerica in permanent telegraphic communication. With a well-manufactured\r\ncable, improved paying-out machinery and an experienced staff of\r\nmechanical engineers, not to mention the foremost electricians of the\r\nday, the immersion of the cable was successfully effected, after which\r\nthe American end of the cable of 1865 was raised, a new length spliced\r\non, and the shore-end safely landed in Trinity Bay. Europe and America\r\nwere thus united together by two electric bonds.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that ocean cables are usually made in three\r\nsections, called, respectively, the shore-end, the intermediate section\r\nand the deep-sea section. It is clear that the submerged conductor needs\r\nthe greatest protection in the shallow water that surrounds the coast,\r\nwhere it lies on a pebbly or rocky bottom, exposed to the drifting\r\naction of currents and tides, as well as to the haling flukes of the\r\nanchors of storm-tossed ships. In deep water, on the other hand, there\r\nis neither shingly bottom nor violent movement to displace and abrade\r\nthe cable; for all is quiet and peaceful in the profound depths where\r\nthe god of the trident holds his court; and hence few coverings and a\r\nlight armor afford sufficient protection. The wear and tear in the ocean\r\ndepths is a vanishing quantity when compared with the abrasive effects\r\nnear coast-lines. Looking at the sections of an ocean cable, the biggest\r\nand heaviest is the shore-end, while the thinnest and lightest is that\r\nwhich goes down into the depths of the sea. The lengths of the various\r\nsections are determined by the survey of the route, which is always\r\ncarefully made before completing the specification of the cable.\r\nMoreover, as the position of the cable-ship at noon every day is known\r\nfrom its longitude and latitude, it follows that the location of the\r\ncable on the bed of the ocean is also exactly known. When a cable is\r\nbroken either by an upheaval or by a subsidence of the ocean floor, the\r\ndistance of the rupture from the shore end is determined by an\r\nelectrical test, after which a repair-ship is dispatched to the spot,\r\nwhen the cable is lifted, the \"fault\" cut away, a new length spliced on,\r\nand the amended cable allowed to settle down into its watery depths.\r\n\r\nAt the present time (July, 1909), there are sixteen cables carrying the\r\nwork of the North Atlantic, at an average speed of 20 words a minute\r\nduplex, or 40 words a minute, counting both directions.\r\n\r\nThis cable narrative affords as striking an illustration of the _triumph\r\nof failure_ as any recorded in the history of human enterprise. It was a\r\nvictory of mind over matter; of character and tactfulness, energy and\r\nendurance over difficulties of every kind, moral and financial,\r\nmechanical and meteorological. The four expeditions of 1857, 1858, 1865\r\nand 1866 represent years of hard work, anxiety and distressing failures;\r\nbut, sustained by the patience of hope and by an unshaken confidence in\r\nthe soundness of the enterprise as well as in the ability of their\r\nstaff, the Directors of the Atlantic Company were well rewarded for the\r\ndisappointment occasioned and the monetary losses incurred. \"It has been\r\na long struggle,\" said the initial promoter of the enterprise, Mr. Cyrus\r\nW. Field, speaking at a banquet given in his honor on November 15th,\r\n1866, at the Metropolitan Hotel, New York, \"a long struggle of nearly\r\nthirteen years of anxious watching and ceaseless toil. Often my heart\r\nwas ready to sink. Many times, when wandering in the forests of\r\nNewfoundland in pelting rain, or on the decks of ships in dark, stormy\r\nnights, I almost accused myself of madness and folly to sacrifice the\r\npeace of my family for what might have proved but a dream. I have seen\r\nmy companions, one after another, fall by my side, and I feared that I,\r\ntoo, might not live to see the end. And yet one hope has led me on; I\r\nprayed that I might not taste of death till the work was accomplished.\r\nThat prayer has been answered; and now, beyond all acknowledgments to\r\nmen, is the feeling of gratitude to Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nIt was men like Field and Thomson that the poet had in mind when he\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    The wise and active conquer difficulties\r\n    By daring to attempt them. Sloth and folly\r\n    Shiver and shrink at sight of toil and labor,\r\n    And make the impossibility they fear.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return home, Prof. Thomson was knighted for his\r\nsplendid services in connection with sub-oceanic cables, and was also\r\nhonored with the freedom of the City of Glasgow.\r\n\r\nIf while journeying over land or sea, Sir William's mind was always\r\nactive, his eyes were also open and observant. In the numerous voyages\r\nwhich he undertook in the interest of cable companies, he seems to have\r\nbeen struck by the unreliable character of the ordinary apparatus used\r\nin taking soundings, consisting of a heavy weight suspended by a thick\r\nhempen cord unwound from a reel. Owing to the massiveness of the cord,\r\nthe motion of the ship and currents in the water would necessarily\r\ndeflect it from the vertical, so that the soundings recorded would be\r\nin excess of the true depth. To remedy this defect, Thomson replaced the\r\nrope, at first by a steel wire, and later by a thin strand of steel\r\nwires, on which the speed of the ship has but little effect; the sinker\r\ndescends vertically with considerable velocity, and is raised with equal\r\nrapidity by suitable winding-up machinery placed in the stern of the\r\nship. The sinker carries a gauge consisting of a quill-tube open at the\r\nlower end and closed at the top. The inside, which is coated with silver\r\nchromate, shows by the discoloration produced by the action of the sea\r\nwater how far the water has compressed the air in the tube. By\r\ncomparison with a graduated ruler, the depth is then read off. When the\r\nsinker reaches bottom, the heavy weight is detached automatically, so\r\nthat there is but little strain on the wire as it ascends with its\r\nthermometer and battery of tubes containing samples of the depths\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nA story is told in connection with this sounding-machine which shows the\r\nvivacity and wit of the inventor. Having brought his friend Joule into\r\nWhite's one day, he pointed to a number of coils of steel wire lying on\r\nthe floor, informing his English friend of \"mechanical-equivalent\" fame\r\nat the same time that he intended the wire for sounding purposes. Upon\r\nJoule's innocently asking what note it would sound, he received the\r\nprompt answer, \"the deep sea\"!\r\n\r\nAnother subject to which Sir William gave some attention after his\r\nexperiences on the ocean is the navigating compass. His observations led\r\nhim to distrust the long, heavy needles then in general use on\r\nshipboard. Besides the friction to which the pressure on the pivot gives\r\nrise and which necessarily diminishes the sensitiveness of the needle,\r\nthere was another objection, due to the difficulty experienced in\r\nsuccessfully applying steel magnets and soft-iron masses to compensate\r\nfor the magnetism of the ship and for the changes induced in it by\r\nchange of place in the earth's magnetic field.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Prof. Thomson devised a compass-card which is remarkable\r\nfor its lightness and sensitiveness. It is made of two sets of magnets,\r\ncontaining four needles each, arranged symmetrically on the right and\r\nleft of the pivot. The four needles, forming a set, are of unequal\r\nlength, ranging from 3-1/4 to 2 inches, with the shortest outermost.\r\nSuch a card, with its associated correctors of steel magnets and\r\nsoft-iron balls, has added greatly to the safety and certainty of\r\nnavigation; and as such, it is used to-day in the merchant service and\r\nin the navies of most countries of the world.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Thomson had the keen, racy wit of his race. Lecturing\r\nbefore the members of the Birmingham and Midland Institute in 1883, he\r\nplaced himself and his nationality on record in a very humorous way. His\r\nsubject was \"The six gateways of Knowledge.\" As will be remembered by\r\nthe readers of _The Pilgrim's Progress_, old Bunyan likened the soul to\r\na citadel on a hill having no means of communication with the outer\r\nworld save by live gates, _viz._, the eye gate, the ear gate, the mouth\r\ngate, the nose gate and the feel gate. These are the five senses by\r\nwhich we obtain our knowledge of the material world which surrounds us.\r\nBut Prof. Thomson took issue with Bunyan, with Reid, and the\r\nmetaphysicians of all time in maintaining in this lecture that we have\r\nsix gateways of knowledge instead of five, justifying the position which\r\nhe took by affirming that the sense of touch is really twofold, one of\r\nheat and the other of force. It does not appear, however, that he made\r\nany marked impression on the philosophic thought of the day, for\r\npsychologists continued to write with undisturbed equanimity of the five\r\nsenses and not the six.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that Prof. Thomson said: \"The only census of the\r\nsenses, so far as I am aware, that ever before made them more than five\r\nwas the Irishman's reckoning of seven senses. I presume the Irishman's\r\nseventh sense was common sense; and I believe that the possession of\r\nthat virtue by my countrymen, _I speak as an Irishman_, I say the large\r\npossession of the seventh sense which I believe Irishmen have, will do\r\nmore to alleviate the woes of Ireland than the removal of 'the\r\nmelancholy ocean' which surrounds its shores.\"\r\n\r\nFor the successful operation of cables, telegraph lines and scientific\r\ninvestigations of all sorts, a system of practical electrical units,\r\naccepted by all companies and countries of the world, was soon found to\r\nbe indispensable. The pioneer in the movement for establishing an\r\ninternational system of electrical standards was Mr. J. Latimer Clark,\r\nwho, assisted by his distinguished partner, (Sir) Charles Bright,\r\nprepared a paper on \"The formation of Standards of Electrical Quantity\r\nand Resistance,\" which was read at the Manchester meeting of the British\r\nAssociation in 1861. Prof. Thomson was present; and, at his instance, a\r\ncommittee was appointed to report on the general question of electrical\r\nunits. This was the first meeting of a committee that was destined to\r\naccomplish much in the electric and electromagnetic field; it was the\r\ninitial impulse of a movement that brought renown to the entire body of\r\nEnglish electricians. Such units as the ohm, the volt and the farad met\r\nwith immediate acceptance, while later on the ampere, the coulomb, the\r\nwatt and the joule were introduced. Among the members of this body\r\nbesides Prof. Thomson, were such able men as Clerk Maxwell, Joule, Lord\r\nRayleigh, Sir William Siemens, Johnstone Stoney, Balfour Stewart, and\r\nCarey Foster.\r\n\r\nThe world is then indebted to the insistence and advocacy of Prof.\r\nThomson for the general acceptance of the \"C.G.S.\" system of\r\nmeasurement, which involves the centimeter (length), the gram (mass),\r\nand the second (time) as the fundamental units from which all others are\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nProf. Thomson has claims in the \"wireless\" field also; for as far back\r\nas 1855, he studied the nature of the discharge of a condenser and\r\nproved mathematically that, under certain conditions easily realized in\r\npractice, such discharges are of an oscillatory character, consisting of\r\na forward and a backward rush of electricity between the two coatings of\r\nthe condenser. As pointed out on page 92, Prof. Henry had reached\r\nthe same conclusion in 1842, and Helmholtz in 1847; but Thomson's\r\ninsight into the phenomenon is keen and his mathematical analysis of it\r\nvery remarkable.\r\n\r\nJust as the to-and-fro motions of the prongs of a tuning-fork give rise\r\nto sound-waves in the air, so the electric oscillation due to a\r\ncondenser discharge sets up in the universal ether electric waves which\r\nflash the news of the world over continents and oceans with unthinkable\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nBy special request, Sir William Thomson gave, in 1884, a course of\r\nlectures at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, to an audience of\r\n\"professional fellow-students in physical science,\" as he called the\r\n_élite_ of American men of science, twenty-one in number, assembled to\r\nhear him. These accomplished physicists he also affectionately called\r\nhis \"twenty-one coefficients.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject was the wave-theory of light, and the object of the lecturer\r\nwas to show how far the phenomena of light, such as its transmission,\r\nrefraction and dispersion, could be explained within the limits of the\r\nelastic solid theory of the ether, which makes that hypothetical medium\r\nrigid, highly elastic and non-gravitational. From the very first\r\nlecture, Sir William assumed a cold and diffident attitude toward the\r\nrival theory of Clerk Maxwell, which makes light an electromagnetic\r\nphenomenon; and though his own presented formidable difficulties, and\r\nits rival was universally accepted, the veteran Professor assured his\r\nhearers that the elastic solid theory is the \"only tenable foundation\r\nfor the wave-theory of light in the present (1884) state of our\r\nknowledge.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the energy which he displayed, his luminous argumentation and\r\nclose logic, Kelvin made no converts among his \"twenty-one\r\ncoefficients\"; and it soon became evident that he was championing a lost\r\ncause. Newton did the same when he held tenaciously to the corpuscular\r\ntheory of light; and in doing so, let it be said, that he retarded the\r\nacceptance of the wave-theory and the advance of science by a hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA few years after the Baltimore lectures, official recognition of his\r\ndistinguished services and of his eminence in science came to Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson when, in 1892, he was raised to the peerage, with the\r\ntitle of Baron Kelvin of Netherhall, Kelvin being the name of a stream\r\nwhich passes near the buildings of the University of Glasgow and flows\r\ninto the Clyde, while Netherhall is that of his country-seat at Largs,\r\nin Ayrshire, 40 miles from Glasgow.\r\n\r\nAs to the structure of matter, Kelvin lived to see the \"atom\" of his\r\nyouth and mature years shattered into fragments, and the atomic theory\r\nof matter rapidly yielding to the electronic. Though he maintained an\r\nopen mind toward the new school of physics, he was reserved and\r\nconservative toward the revolutionary doctrine of extreme\r\nradio-activists. He did not believe in the transformation of one\r\nelementary form of matter into another; and he strenuously combated the\r\ntheory of the spontaneous disintegration of the atom.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding a long life devoted to the study of mathematical and\r\nexperimental physics, during which Kelvin unraveled many a difficult\r\nproblem in electricity and magnetism and added many a beautiful skein to\r\nthe texture of our knowledge in electrostatics and electrokinetics, that\r\nillustrious man, the acknowledged leader in physical science, made a\r\npublic admission in 1896 which caused a great stir throughout the\r\nscientific world. It was on the occasion of the celebration of the\r\ngolden jubilee of his professorship of natural philosophy in the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow. Delegates had come from all parts of the world;\r\nkings and princes had sent their representatives; universities and\r\nlearned societies of every country of the Old World and the New vied\r\nwith one another in doing honor to the scientist who had figured so long\r\nand so conspicuously in the advances of the age. It was on that solemn\r\noccasion and in presence of such a notable assembly that Kelvin made the\r\nastonishing admission that, although he had been a diligent student of\r\nelectricity and magnetism for a period exceeding fifty years, and\r\nalthough he had pondered every day for forty years over the nature of\r\nthe ether and the constitution of matter, he knew no more about their\r\nessence, about what they really are, than he knew at the beginning of\r\nhis professional work.\r\n\r\nThis confession, remarkable by reason of the man who made it and the\r\ncircumstances in which it was made, has always appeared to the writer of\r\nthese lines as having more of the ring of disappointment in it than of\r\nblank failure. Kelvin's great analytical mind early and persistently\r\nstrove to penetrate the closely guarded secrets of nature; and because\r\nDame Nature did not yield to his open sesame, but persisted in her\r\nreticence, the philosopher grew pessimistic and disappointed; and, under\r\nthe sway of such feelings, he summed up the result of his life-quest\r\nafter the ultimate problems in science and pronounced it a \"failure.\"\r\n\r\nA \"failure\" it was not, if science is the discovery and registration of\r\nthe laws of God as revealed in the universe of mind and matter; for few\r\nmen of his generation, if any, made more contributions of the first\r\norder to the theory of electrostatics, to the doctrine of energy, to\r\nhydrodynamics and the thermo-electric properties of matter. This note of\r\ndisappointment, or wail of despondency, had been sounded before by\r\nFaraday, who said that, the more he studied electrical phenomena, the\r\nless he seemed to know about electricity itself. Was not Laplace\r\nanimated by a kindred feeling when he spoke about the infinitude of our\r\nignorance? Lastly, was not this intense feeling of our limited powers\r\nprecisely that which, after all his discoveries in mathematics, in\r\noptics and in celestial mechanics, made Newton compare himself to a\r\nchild standing on the beach with the vast ocean of truth before him,\r\nunfathomed and unexplored?\r\n\r\nKelvin gave a beautiful example to the world when, after resigning the\r\nchair which he had occupied for fifty-five years in the University of\r\nGlasgow, he immediately proceeded to enter his name on the undergraduate\r\nlist, intimating by such an act that, whether a man is a\r\nprofessor-in-ordinary of natural philosophy or a professor emeritus, he\r\nmust ever be a student, in close touch with nature.\r\n\r\nLord Kelvin had the happiness of enjoying good health throughout all the\r\nyears of his long career, a happiness due in part to nature, and in part\r\nalso to the simplicity, frugality and regularity of his life.\r\n\r\nAs already said, he was fond of cruising in European waters in his yacht\r\n_Lalla Rookh_ during the summer months, and even venturing out on the\r\nAtlantic as far as Madeira, for,\r\n\r\n    He loved the sea, and what is more,\r\n    He loved it best when far from shore.\r\n\r\nIn later years, however, owing to facial neuralgia, he was accustomed to\r\nspend a month or so every summer with Lady Kelvin at Aix-les-Bains, from\r\nwhich visits he always derived much benefit.\r\n\r\nWhile making some experiments in a corridor of his beautiful home at\r\nNetherhall, he caught a chill on November 23d, 1907, from which he never\r\nrallied, despite the cares and attentions that were fondly lavished upon\r\nhim. The bulletins that were issued concerning his condition were read\r\nall the world over with more concern than if they referred to a reigning\r\nsovereign or an heir apparent. Every teacher of physics, mathematical\r\nor experimental; every man interested in the advance of science and the\r\nspread of knowledge, anxiously awaited news from the sick-room of the\r\nillustrious patient--news that was transmitted to the ends of the earth\r\nby the siphon-recorder invented by the dying scientist in the heyday of\r\nhis life; and when the word came that Kelvin had breathed his last, that\r\ncablegram brought universal sorrow for the quenching of the brightest\r\nlight of the age and the loss of the leading scientist, the model man\r\nand faithful Christian.\r\n\r\nIt was in the fitness of things that the man who was considered the\r\ngreatest since Newton should be buried in Westminster Abbey, and that\r\nthe mortal remains of Lord Kelvin should find a resting-place next to\r\nthe grave of the genius who thought out the _Principia_ and discovered\r\nthe gravitational law which governs the planetary as well as the stellar\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nIf asked to say what impressed me most in Lord Kelvin, I would mention\r\nthe cordial manner in which he welcomed those who sought advice; the\r\nencouragement which he held out to students; his absolute devotion to\r\ntruth; his fair-mindedness and candor; his reverence in dealing with the\r\nproblems of the soul and the destiny of man; and the uniform, tranquil\r\nhappiness of his life, due, under God, to his profound religious belief\r\nand noble Christian life.\r\n\r\nA man of strong convictions, Kelvin did not, however, wear his religion\r\non his sleeve, but treasured it in the depths of his heart, where it was\r\nnever disturbed by the tossing and ever-changing wave-forms of\r\nindividual opinion. He quietly but uniformly maintained that physical\r\nscience demands the existence and action of creative power; and he did\r\nnot shrink from affirming this conviction whenever circumstances seemed\r\nto require it, as was the case on the memorable occasion of his\r\nPresidential address to the members of the British Association in 1871.\r\nIn concluding that brilliant discourse, he said: \"But strong,\r\noverpowering proofs of intelligent and benevolent design lie all around\r\nus; and if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific, turn\r\nus away from them for a time, they come back upon us with irresistible\r\nforce, showing to us, through nature, the influence of free will, and\r\nteaching us that all living beings depend on one ever-acting Creator and\r\nRuler.\"\r\n\r\nOnce when particularly disgusted with the materialistic views of those\r\nwho, while denying the existence of a Creator, attributed the wonders of\r\nnature, animate and inanimate, to the potency of a fortuitous concourse\r\nof atoms, he wrote to Liebig, asking him if a leaf or a flower could be\r\nformed or even made grow by chemical forces, to which he received the\r\nsignificant reply from the famous chemist of Giessen: \"I would more\r\nreadily believe that a book on chemistry or on botany could grow out of\r\ndead matter by chemical processes.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the custom which obtained in the University\r\nof Glasgow, of beginning the daily sessions by invoking the blessing of\r\nheaven on the work about to be undertaken. Having liberty in the matter\r\nof choice, Prof. Thomson selected for this purpose a prayer from the\r\nmorning service of the Church of England, which reads: \"O Lord, our\r\nheavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely brought\r\nus to the beginning of this day; defend us in the same with Thy mighty\r\npower; and grant that this day we fall into no sin, neither run into any\r\nkind of danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by Thy\r\ngovernance, to do always what is righteous in Thy sight; through Jesus\r\nChrist, our Lord, Amen.\"\r\n\r\nAcademical honors were showered upon Lord Kelvin by seats of learning,\r\nancient and modern; he was a D. C. L. Oxford, LL. D. Cambridge, and a D.\r\nSc. London; he was President of the Royal Society from 1890 to 1895;\r\nPresident of the British Association in 1871; Knight of the Prussian\r\nOrder _Pour le Mérite_, and Foreign Associate of the _Institut de\r\nFrance_.\r\n\r\nHis published works include a \"Treatise on Natural Philosophy,\" 2 vols.,\r\nwritten in collaboration with Prof. Tait, of Edinburgh (the two authors\r\nwere often referred to as T and T'); \"Contributions to Electrostatics\r\nand Magnetism\"; \"Collected mathematical and physical Papers,\" 3 vols.;\r\n\"Popular Lectures and Addresses,\" 3 vols.; and the \"Baltimore Lectures.\"\r\nThese, as well as the instruments which he devised for navigation, for\r\nthe finest work of the laboratory, as well as for the commercial\r\nmeasurement of current, potential, and energy, form a monument to Lord\r\nKelvin that will be _aere perennius_.\r\n\r\nBROTHER POTAMIAN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] Water was decomposed in 1789 by Van Troostwijk and\r\nCuthberson, by means of sparks from an electrical machine.

OF MODERN MEDICINE--A series Of Biographies of the men to whom we\r\nowe the important advances in the development of modern medicine. By\r\nJames J. Walsh, M. D., Ph. D., LL.D., Dean and Professor of the History\r\nof Medicine at Fordham University School of Medicine, N. Y. Second\r\nEdition, 1909. 362 pp. Price, $2.00 net.\r\n\r\n_The London Lancet_ said: \"The list is well chosen, and we have to\r\nexpress gratitude for so convenient and agreeable a collection of\r\nbiographies, for which we might otherwise have to search through many\r\nscattered books. The sketches are pleasantly written, interesting, and\r\nwell adapted to convey the thoughtful members of our profession just the\r\namount of historical knowledge that they would wish to obtain. We hope\r\nthat the book will find many readers.\"\r\n\r\n_The New York Times_: \"The book is intended primarily for students of\r\nmedicine, but laymen will find it not a little interesting.\"\r\n\r\n_Il Morgagni_ (Italy): \"Professor Walsh narrates important lives in\r\nmodern medicine with an easy style that makes his book delightful\r\nreading. It certainly will give the young physician an excellent idea of\r\nwho made our modern medicine.\"\r\n\r\n_The Lamp_: \"This exceptionally interesting book is from the practiced\r\nhand of Dr. James J. Walsh. It is a suggestive thought that each of the\r\ngreat specialists portrayed were god-fearing men, men of faith, far\r\nremoved from the shallow materialism that frequently flaunts itself as\r\ninherently worthy of extra consideration for its own sake.\"\r\n\r\n_The Church Standard_ (_Protestant Episcopal_): \"There is perhaps no\r\nprofession in which the lives of its leaders would make more fascinating\r\nreading than that of medicine, and Dr. Walsh by his clever style and\r\nsympathetic treatment by no means mars the interest which we might thus\r\nexpect.\"\r\n\r\n_The New York Medical Journal_: \"We welcome works of this kind; they are\r\nevidence of the growth of culture within the medical profession, which\r\nbetokens that the time has come when our teachers have the leisure to\r\nlook backward to what has been accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n_Science_: \"The sketches are extremely entertaining and useful. Perhaps\r\nthe most striking thing is that everyone of the men described was of the\r\nCatholic faith, and the dominant idea is that great scientific work is\r\nnot incompatible with devout adherence to the tenets of the Catholic\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POPES AND SCIENCE--The story Of the Papal Relations to Science from\r\nthe Middle Ages down to the Nineteenth Century. By James J. Walsh, M.\r\nD., Ph. D., LL.D. 440 pp. Price, $2.00 net.\r\n\r\nPROF. PAGEL, Professor of History at the University of Berlin: \"This\r\nbook represents the most serious contribution to the history of medicine\r\nthat has ever come out of America.\"\r\n\r\nSIR CLIFFORD ALLBUTT, Regius Professor of Physic at the University of\r\nCambridge (England): \"The book as a whole is a fair as well as a\r\nscholarly argument.\"\r\n\r\n_The Evening Post_ (New York) says: \"However strong the reader's\r\nprejudice...he cannot lay down Prof. Walsh's volume without at\r\nleast conceding that the author has driven his pen hard and deep into\r\nthe 'academic superstition' about Papal Opposition to science.\" In a\r\nprevious issue it had said: \"We venture to prophesy that all who swear\r\nby Dr. Andrew D. White's History of the Warfare of Science With Theology\r\nin Christendom will find their hands full, if they attempt to answer Dr.\r\nJames J. Walsh's The Popes and Science.\"\r\n\r\n_The Literary Digest_ said: \"The book is well worth reading for its\r\nextensive learning and the vigor of its style.\"\r\n\r\n_The Southern Messenger_ says: \"Books like this make it clear that it is\r\nignorance alone that makes people, even supposedly educated people,\r\nstill cling to the old calumnies.\"\r\n\r\n_The Nation_ (New York) says: \"The learned Fordham Physician has at\r\ncommand an enormous mass of facts, and he orders them with logic, force\r\nand literary ease. Prof. Walsh convicts his opponents of hasty\r\ngeneralizing if not anti-clerical zeal.\"\r\n\r\n_The Pittsburg Post_ says: \"With the fair attitude of mind and\r\ninfluenced only by the student's desire to procure knowledge, this book\r\nbecomes at once something to fascinate. On every page authoritative\r\nfacts confute the stereotyped statement of the purely theological\r\npublications.\"\r\n\r\nPROF. WELCH, of Johns Hopkins, quoting Martial, said: \"It is pleasant\r\nindeed to drink at the living fountain-heads of knowledge after\r\npreviously having had only the stagnant pools of second-hand authority.\"\r\n\r\nPROF. PIERSOL, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nsaid: \"I have been reading the book with the keenest interest, for it\r\nindeed presents many subjects in what to me at least is a new light.\r\nEvery man of science looks to the beacon--truth--as his guiding mark,\r\nand every opportunity to replace even time-honored misconceptions by\r\nwhat is really the truth must be welcomed.\"\r\n\r\n_The Independent_ (New York) said: \"Dr. Walsh's books should be read in\r\nconnection with attacks upon the Popes in the matter of science by those\r\nwho want to get both sides.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER BOOKS BY THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\nFORDHAM UNIVERSITY PRESS SERIES\r\n\r\nMAKERS OF MODERN MEDICINE (second thousand).
